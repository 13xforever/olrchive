1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It may be true that 2D Mario games outsell 3D Mario games, but the same is not true of

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,360
Pokemon, as Scarlet and Violet reach 10 million units sold in three days.

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,920
It's not all gold and silver, as many gamers have taken up swords and shields to decry

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,320
the quality of their beloved game.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,640
They're ready to rumble in the stadium before going home to probably play more.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,440
That's the cycle of the sun and moon.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,440
Legends.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,760
This is the punniest intro I've done.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,240
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,160
this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where every

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,160
gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,640
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,000
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,960
It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again for tonight, November the 27th of 2022, episode

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,700
number 938 of our show.

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,340
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you every week with my co-hosts, well, not

17
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,920
here this week, Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers.

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,600
She has the night off as we talked about last week.

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,180
She went on a trip for the holidays to go see her mom, who she's talked a lot about

20
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,180
on the show recently.

21
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,960
My understanding is she actually did get back last night.

22
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,820
She just kind of wanted to take tonight off to sort of recover, which I can completely

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,820
understand.

24
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,660
I know when I go on a big trip, I need a vacation for my vacation, so she's just going to continue

25
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,660
the night off.

26
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,700
She's going to be joining us again next week back on the program.

27
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,700
Instead, of course, we have, as we have every week, Techmaster Loki.

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,700
Hello.

29
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,700
Hi, how are you?

30
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,700
I'm good.

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,700
Good, good.

32
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,260
And no third host tonight.

33
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,140
I was out of town myself because with the Thanksgiving holiday in the States, I was

34
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,140
gone for a couple of days because I went to a Friendsgiving.

35
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,340
For those of you that remember the show, Hoard House, my pal, Grandpa, has a murder cabin

36
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,340
up in the woods.

37
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:03,180
I call it murder cabin because it's a very remote part of the rural California, but it

38
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,180
was great.

39
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,660
We had a nice Friendsgiving celebration.

40
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,980
It was lovely.

41
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,580
But kept me out of town for a couple of days, so I wasn't really thinking about, oh, who

42
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,180
should sit in on OLR this week?

43
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,740
It's just Loki and I holding down the fort tonight with all of you in our chat over at

44
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:27,440
twitch.tv slash vog network or VOG network because we do tape live every Sunday night

45
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,300
at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the

46
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,340
Voice of Geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

47
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,100
And some folks tonight in chat talking about our little parody bump that opened the show

48
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:47,980
tonight, which was a riff on Atari 50 and She-Hulk 10 in chat is saying, woohoo, Atari

49
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,500
2600 is the best console ever made.

50
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,260
It certainly is the heaviest.

51
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,460
It certainly is the one that you probably could use in a murder cabin.

52
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:03,040
No, I obviously I would never endorse that, but Atari 2600 obviously without it, we wouldn't

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,580
have a lot of games that we have today.

54
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,580
That's for sure.

55
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,500
Atari 2600 is a legendary console and really one of the first that I remember playing.

56
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:18,660
SH-100 Matt is noting in chat the video game that is playing behind Loki tonight is Festers

57
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:26,360
Quest from the Super Nintendo, Nintendo era, which fun fact, Festers Quest in many ways

58
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,640
is Blaster Master 2.

59
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,620
They very much run on the same engine, except Festers Quest is only the overhead sequences

60
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,040
from Blaster Master does not have any of the side scroller and the vampart.

61
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,820
But if you were to take all of the overhead sequences and make a game out of it, you basically

62
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,660
get Festers Quest on the NES.

63
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,660
And some people loved it.

64
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,660
Some people hated it.

65
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,860
And it also, it cracks me up because it's like a lot of the same mechanics, the gun

66
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,180
increasing levels.

67
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,320
Even those little frogs are the same fricking sprites from Blaster Master.

68
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,000
So Festers Quest, like I don't know how Festers Quest and Blaster Master got set in the same

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,560
universe, but they very much are.

70
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,680
I just want to point that out.

71
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,520
Were you a fan of Festers Quest back in the day?

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah, it was all right.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,200
Yeah, I remember reading a lot of like the walkthroughs in Nintendo Power and stuff like

74
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
that.

75
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Yeah.

76
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,220
I got a copy of Festers Quest for Christmas one time.

77
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,480
And it was a Christmas gift I spoiled for myself because my mom had gone to the store.

78
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,320
I don't remember what store she went to.

79
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,160
Some store that doesn't exist anymore.

80
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,920
Probably I want to say it was like KB Toys or something like that.

81
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,700
She went to and there was a bag or she went to the store next to KB Toys, but there was

82
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,200
a shopping bag.

83
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,400
Sometimes I'll be like, oh, what did mom get at the grocery store?

84
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,160
And I look and there's a KB Toys bag in there.

85
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,160
I'm like, oh, why did you go to KB Toys?

86
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,160
And I open it.

87
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,060
There's a copy of Festers Quest in there.

88
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,760
And I put two and two together and I was like, oh shit, that was my Christmas present.

89
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,660
I just saw like, even at the age of like 10, I was like, oops, I wasn't supposed to see

90
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,660
this.

91
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,760
So I put it back and just walked out of the room and pretended I didn't see nothing.

92
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,400
And then on Christmas Day, I act surprised and thankful.

93
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,800
And it's not like I have to play the game early.

94
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,320
I just saw the box sitting there.

95
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,600
So that's, uh, that's my Festers Quest story.

96
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,040
Dardusia says, I know I rented Festers Quest a time or two.

97
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
Yeah.

98
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,080
I think everybody, everybody that was gaming in that area had to have played it at some

99
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
point.

100
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
I'm sure.

101
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
Digirama S says it was pretty good.

102
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
I enjoyed Festers Quest.

103
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,540
I think I wouldn't say it's like an all time greatest NES game, but I think people give

104
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,160
it more shit than they need to.

105
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,400
And I think when you realize that this game is Blaster Master 2, you kind of go, oh, should

106
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,440
I be talking so much shit about this game?

107
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,160
And this game is probably better than the actual Blaster Master 2 that they put out

108
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,560
on the Genesis years later.

109
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
So there is that.

110
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,560
All right.

111
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,560
From the 3D Blaster Master game that they put out on, was it the original PlayStation

112
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
or something like that?

113
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
Oh yeah.

114
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,440
There was a, or 3D Blaster Master on the original PlayStation.

115
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:57,320
Then they did a reboot on the Nintendo Wii that was okay, but the physics were off and

116
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,760
you can't have the physics be off in a Blaster Master game.

117
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,640
They have to, they have to feel like the original or the whole game is thrown off.

118
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,400
That was my big problem with it.

119
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,920
But the other, and I know I've mentioned this on the show, but I'll say it again.

120
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:14,080
The recent Blaster Master Zero reimagining, because they kind of, they didn't really totally

121
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
remake it.

122
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,120
They really redid some things.

123
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,400
The Blaster Master Zero, I think is one of the most well done remasters, reimagines,

124
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,880
whatever you want to call it, that they've done of any game of the NES era, to be quite

125
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,720
frankly.

126
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,520
That is probably one of the best.

127
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,160
And they ended up making a whole trilogy out of that, which Blaster Master two and

128
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,500
three, or Blaster Master Zero two and three, I don't think have anything to do with the

129
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:44,280
original series at all, except they made a character in those games out of a character

130
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,340
that was only in the FX9 books.

131
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,400
The worlds of power books that were based off of NES games from back in the day.

132
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,560
So random, useless, fun fact if you're ever on Jeopardy someday.

133
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Being in chat.

134
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,520
Yeah, Dr. Sia says there's only the Blaster Master Zero trilogy.

135
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,120
Yeah, I would I would actually super recommend that.

136
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,800
SHO 100 Matt says yeah, the AVGN video gave it kind of a bad rap.

137
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,000
I think too many people take that person's opinions and slap like if that guy says this

138
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,440
game is bad, hahaha, then they agree this game is bad.

139
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,160
When it's like I, you know, I'm not going to defend that this is an all time great,

140
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,420
but I think it's better than people give it credit for.

141
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,420
And that's the case.

142
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,060
I'm just gonna say it with a lot of those videos because another one another one I think

143
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,060
it's a lot of shit unnecessarily is the Friday the 13th video game.

144
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,060
Is it?

145
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,060
Is it great?

146
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,060
No, it does.

147
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,660
It has an amazing soundtrack as an incredible soundtrack.

148
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,220
And I like that Jason looks all neon and funky.

149
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,540
Keep in mind that game came out around the time they were making movies like Jason in

150
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,540
space.

151
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,880
I'm sorry, but the Jason in that game is just fine for where the franchise was out at that

152
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,880
time.

153
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,720
And you know, the the character balance is extremely lopsided and there's there's other

154
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,960
issues of that game.

155
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,360
But I don't think Friday the 13th is nearly as bad as people give the rap on that game.

156
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,760
So that's my thought.

157
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,280
And of course, you know, I have a copy.

158
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,960
Well not Fester's Quest, but I have a copy of nice blaster master nice right here on

159
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,480
my computer because perfect.

160
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,340
That's where I store my NES games apparently.

161
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,400
Now that is a game I will defend as an all time great blaster master was extremely underrated

162
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
at the time.

163
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
And it's an incredible game.

164
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Start to finish.

165
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Yeah.

166
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
All right.

167
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,040
Well, we could talk about, you know, the old men could sit here and talk about NES games

168
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,760
all night, but we should probably talk about what else is going on in the industry.

169
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,040
Let's get to our kickoff topic tonight, which has to do with, you know, ever since this

170
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,640
Microsoft and Activision Blizzard merger was announced, we knew this was going to go through

171
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,560
a lot of legal scrutiny.

172
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:48,840
And we're getting a lot more information that's coming out of statements, filings, Sony's

173
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:56,720
rebuttal, Microsoft's defense, like this, this is really the what do you call those

174
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,880
agreements?

175
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,080
The name escapes me in the moment.

176
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,760
Of course, now I'm trying to think of it.

177
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
Non-disclosure.

178
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,760
Thank you.

179
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,200
This is really the NDA gift that keeps on giving is this whole little merger.

180
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,480
So let's talk about some of the things that came out as a result of this this week, Loki.

181
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,680
It's basically say anything is what it is.

182
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,800
They're just saying whatever they can to try to persuade the government bodies that are

183
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,540
looking at this to persuade them, obviously, one way or the other.

184
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:33,960
So you have things like where Xbox, you know, Microsoft and the Xbox team are saying, well,

185
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,640
you know, PlayStation exclusives are better than our, you know, exclusive games.

186
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,920
And so it's it's fine that we get, you know, Call of Duty as an exclusive game because,

187
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,680
you know, they have their exclusive games and those are better.

188
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:56,280
That's one argument that they're making and with the CMA in UK.

189
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,960
That argument should be thrown out of court with with a copy of Forza Horizon, any of

190
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
them on top.

191
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,240
Well, then also they're saying, you know, Nintendo also has better quality exclusives

192
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,560
as well that outsell their own first party games.

193
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,040
And maybe, you know, maybe that is true to a certain extent.

194
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,640
I don't know.

195
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,720
And Sony, that's all opinions, Sony.

196
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,200
You know, the argument is saying, well, hey, you're not like losing out on all of the first

197
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
person shooter franchises.

198
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,480
I mean, you have Battlefield, Battlefield is a great first person franchise.

199
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,840
And so he's like, no, no, it's not.

200
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,280
It is not as good as Call of Duty.

201
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,640
And so that's kind of funny.

202
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,980
They're saying, you know, Call of Duty is not replaceable.

203
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,800
You could always bring back resistance.

204
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,560
Sony, you feel that strongly about it.

205
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,560
Why don't you bring back resistance?

206
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,880
I would be for that for sure.

207
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,880
I love resistance.

208
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,520
That game was awesome.

209
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,760
Really they should bring that back or even like Killzone would be fine.

210
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,280
Bring that back to I mean, there's franchises that they have or I mean, gosh, they have

211
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,760
a ton of franchises.

212
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,180
There's mag that they stopped doing stuff with.

213
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,180
So calm.

214
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:10,760
I mean, so many franchises that could be a big like first person shooter, Call of Duty

215
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,620
type game that they've just kind of dumped on.

216
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,780
But they also that something somehow came out of this that Sony has confirmed that the

217
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:29,040
release date of the PlayStation six is going to be somewhere around 2028, 2027.

218
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,960
So so much for the days of when they were saying that the PlayStation three was a 10

219
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
year life cycle.

220
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,460
Well, I think they've just.

221
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,460
They do this all the time.

222
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,940
The 10 year life cycle doesn't mean that the next console can't come out and the life

223
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,420
cycle, the old one continues.

224
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,380
I think I think that's where they're going with it.

225
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,660
I think a lot of I'm trying to remember when did the PlayStation three come out 2006.

226
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,660
Right.

227
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,060
And then when did the PlayStation four come out?

228
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,700
Was it 2012 or 2013?

229
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,820
Well, no, actually, I think the PlayStation.

230
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:03,660
Yeah, it was 2006 and PlayStation four was.

231
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,660
I think it was.

232
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,660
Hmm.

233
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,100
I'm going to have to fact check myself.

234
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
It was 2013.

235
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,100
13.

236
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,100
Yeah.

237
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,100
Because I remember I picked it up a year later.

238
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,820
OK, so honestly, then that is so 2013.

239
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,820
Here's the deal.

240
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,220
So 2006 place.

241
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,460
Actually, let's let's go all the way.

242
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,460
Holy fuck.

243
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,660
I believe the math works out.

244
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,620
When did the original PlayStation come out?

245
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,140
I think 97.

246
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,580
No, I'm looking 94 in Japan.

247
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,140
It was 95 here, but 94 in Japan.

248
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,140
OK.

249
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,140
Add seven.

250
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,060
I didn't get until here we go.

251
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,060
Sony.

252
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,060
This news should not be news.

253
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,060
Here's why.

254
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,700
Sony PlayStation one out in Japan.

255
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,420
December 1994.

256
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,580
Add seven years.

257
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,500
Now it's 2001.

258
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,540
That's when the PlayStation two came out.

259
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,540
Add seven years.

260
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,700
OK, wait, I guess that one doesn't work because that's no way when did PlayStation two come

261
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,700
out?

262
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,820
It was 2000, 2000 or 2001.

263
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,860
It was after 2000.

264
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,420
I think it was in Japan early, though.

265
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,420
It was.

266
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,420
It was in Japan early.

267
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,420
So it's 2000.

268
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,420
So I take it back.

269
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,420
Sorry.

270
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,420
I need to get my year straight.

271
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,420
OK, so six years.

272
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:21,620
So 1994 to 2006 years, then 2000 to 2006, six years, then 2006 to 2013 when the PlayStation

273
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:28,100
four came out, seven years, then 2013 to 2020, seven years.

274
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:34,920
So Sony has literally always been on a six or seven year life cycle.

275
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,100
So the news that the PlayStation six is coming in 2027 really shouldn't surprise you because

276
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,980
the PlayStation five was out in 2020.

277
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,820
However.

278
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
I have seen where people are like, this feels like it's too soon.

279
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,020
I can't even get my hands on a PlayStation five still, but about about and that's the

280
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:58,820
thing that's different is that only the PlayStation five came out in a pandemic.

281
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,580
And the PlayStation five had such these severe supply chain shortages that, you know, here

282
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,500
we are in 2022.

283
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,700
And only just now are these things kind of findable pretty easy.

284
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,020
My understanding is if you sign up to get one on the PlayStation first hand store, whatever

285
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,680
you're you're going to get one sooner rather than later.

286
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,300
So these are not extraordinarily difficult to get anymore.

287
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:26,580
But again, the whole can you just walk into Target and buy one sometimes depends on where

288
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,980
you live.

289
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,000
So that's that's where that's at.

290
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,200
And I think that's why so so it doesn't feel like the PlayStation five launched in 2020.

291
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,220
It feels like it's just now launching in 2022.

292
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,100
So that's why it still feels kind of early, I think for the PlayStation six.

293
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:48,140
But otherwise, the PS six being in 2027 is right on schedule.

294
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:53,740
Yeah, I guess I'm not not too shocked.

295
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,380
And all that stuff can change anyways.

296
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,380
And who cares?

297
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,740
Yeah, we always know that they're working on the next big console.

298
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:09,180
Um, also, apparently, it Well, I don't know who's political is reporting that according

299
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:14,020
to three people knowledge of the matter, that the FTC is likely to file an antitrust lawsuit

300
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:18,880
against Microsoft to block the takeover of Activision.

301
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,620
Of course, then Activision has come out and said, you know, that's just ridiculous.

302
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,780
It's completely absurd.

303
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,900
So I guess we'll see what happens.

304
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,960
You know, predictions are all over the place.

305
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:43,420
I mean, honestly, I'd be very surprised like if they do, like file an antitrust lawsuit

306
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,260
against, you know, Microsoft, because I mean, they've let other mergers, especially in the

307
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:52,260
entertainment space, go through that have been even more toxic than this up discovery.

308
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:58,740
And, you know, um, so like, why this like, why Oh, but we're putting our foot down with

309
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,060
these games.

310
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:05,920
You know, I think some politicians want to want to put on their resume that they nailed

311
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,900
Activision Blizzard.

312
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,700
But like, yeah, but they can do that after the fall.

313
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,780
And when in fact, as far as those issues are concerned, this merger is actually a good thing

314
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:19,500
because there will be no place for Bobby Kotick in this future organization.

315
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,880
And Phil Spencer is a more competent leader than anyone at the top of Activision.

316
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,280
So like this in that department, it's you can tell the politicians don't follow the gaming

317
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,360
industry.

318
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,060
Because like this merger would actually be a good thing for all of those things.

319
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,620
Some of them are super elderly.

320
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,620
It's like ridiculous.

321
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,180
Yeah, I don't know.

322
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,180
I'm not surprised.

323
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,180
I'm surprised.

324
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:46,740
Yeah, we always used to get those like soundbites if they're like antiquated, like takes of

325
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,200
stuff like, you know, well, I remember playing Pac Man and stuff like that.

326
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,480
Now we're those people.

327
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,420
So I don't know.

328
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:00,740
Well, a very, very interesting thing is happening in Congress like just today.

329
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,140
Because you know, Nancy Pelosi is retiring.

330
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,780
And there's been a lot of talk about, you know, a new class kind of coming up to take

331
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,780
her place.

332
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,820
It was announced today that three younger when I say younger, I mean 30s 40s 50s politicians

333
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:18,180
are going to be kind of coming up in the ranks behind them.

334
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,780
Obviously though, the Democrats are not going to be in charge of the house next year, I'm

335
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,260
not going to get into all those complex politics right now.

336
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:29,220
But it's just one of those you do see that politicians are finally starting to hand the

337
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,060
torch over to a newer generation that's probably going to be more in tune with some of this

338
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,060
stuff.

339
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,060
So that will be interesting.

340
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:42,940
So, um, Bobby Blackwell says they did block a major book publisher deal random house when

341
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,580
it emerged with Simon and Schuster and the feds block that I do remember when that was

342
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,580
going on.

343
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,860
They know what books are, um, sj 100.

344
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,580
Matt does point out even if they block the merger, Microsoft can still do other things

345
00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:00,300
to make it not an antitrust issue like splitting off Xbox from Microsoft, or selling assets

346
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,300
to make it not an antitrust issue.

347
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,500
I don't see them splitting off Xbox, that would be wild.

348
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,940
But I could see them cut off three, four, three, I could see them cutting king out of

349
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,940
it.

350
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,940
Actually, I don't know.

351
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,120
I think that's the easy answer.

352
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,420
But I actually am like Microsoft in the mobile game making space actually is probably more

353
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:24,860
desirable than maybe even some of the components of Activision to be quite honest.

354
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:30,940
So it'll it'll really come down to what are the parts of the merger that you know, the

355
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,980
government really has a problem with and go from there.

356
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:39,540
But I think that the answer to a lot of Sony's arguments is Nintendo.

357
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,820
Like Nintendo is still a factor in the room.

358
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,740
As far as we know, Nintendo and Microsoft do not have any publishing agreements together.

359
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,800
And so Nintendo still continues to be the top selling console and have some of the top

360
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,520
selling video games in the entire industry.

361
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,820
So it's weird to me that this isn't Microsoft and Nintendo merging.

362
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,940
It's Microsoft and Activision Blizzard merging.

363
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,460
I just think it's real rich from Sony that like literally the tactics that they do now

364
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,980
Microsoft is doing the same thing.

365
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,360
They're like, Whoa, hold on.

366
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,360
This is not okay.

367
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,200
You're like, it's it's literally what you're doing.

368
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,940
Like you do this stuff all the time with paid exclusives and, and like paid content for

369
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,940
your service.

370
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,580
Like, I'm sorry.

371
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,900
This is exactly now you're now you're, you know, complaining because it's fair.

372
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,900
Poor baby.

373
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,260
Oh, no.

374
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:33,180
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says they could sell Call of Duty to Tencent and that would fix

375
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,220
it because really the issue is over Call of Duty so sell Call of Duty to Tencent and call

376
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,220
it a day.

377
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,020
God, I hope they don't sell it to Tencent.

378
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,060
You want to talk about companies that are getting too big.

379
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,460
Like that's that's a perfect example.

380
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,700
I don't know who they'll I am.

381
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:52,300
I would think you spin off that whole studio that makes Call of Duty into an independent

382
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,500
studio and they they own the Call of Duty IP.

383
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,500
And that's that.

384
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,380
But then this then Sony comes in and buys them watch.

385
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:05,740
Yeah, they would they would absolutely would that because they would and it would be all

386
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,740
sudden fine.

387
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,420
Because I you know, I'm sure they want to go sell it to Square Enix.

388
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,140
Well, there is all these rumors about Sony wanting to get with Square Enix and why Square

389
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,420
Enix just unloaded a bunch of their studios.

390
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:23,340
Lutely no ethics in corporate, you know, procedure like they will just do whatever they want

391
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,020
to stay on top.

392
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,020
So like, yeah, absolutely.

393
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,180
If they were to spin it off in their own independent company, they would absolutely move in and

394
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,180
try to buy it.

395
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,180
Yeah.

396
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:37,780
I honestly and Bobby says every Activision studio makes a Call of Duty at Toys a Bob

397
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,820
works on Call of Duty.

398
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,980
They canceled a Skylanders game to work on Call of Duty.

399
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,700
Yeah, no, that is that is true.

400
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,620
I think I think I think the most fascinating part of the deal, if it went this way, would

401
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,780
be what if they just spin off Activision and only by Blizzard King?

402
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:58,540
I think I as a gamer, that's the part that would make me most happy, honestly, let Activision

403
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,220
kind of do its own thing.

404
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,040
And again, I don't want to see Bobby Cody in the industry, but I would love to see Blizzard

405
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,860
and King just go under Microsoft and let Microsoft do what they're going to do with the Blizzard

406
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,860
franchises.

407
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,860
I think that would be a great thing.

408
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,860
I think the gamers would stand to win a lot in that scenario.

409
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,420
I mean, that's assuming Microsoft wants that.

410
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,260
But you know, the point was brought up earlier, it really is about Call of Duty.

411
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,180
World of Warcraft these days don't make the numbers that Call of Duty does.

412
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:28,820
Overwatch, while it had a big launch, we still don't know about the sustainability of it.

413
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,900
Diablo 4, too early to tell.

414
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,080
So you know, we'll, we'll see.

415
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,300
There's a lot more to come on that.

416
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,460
So all right, let's move on.

417
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,700
Before we get to our gaming weeks, I want to tell a little bit of a side story.

418
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,600
So I was going to bring this up last week, but I kind of talked about last week on the

419
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,600
show.

420
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,480
I had a lot of feelings and I was not in a great mental place last week.

421
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,280
I'm doing much better this week.

422
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,280
Thank you.

423
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,080
And yeah, thank you for letting me have my space on last week's show.

424
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,680
But because I was in a weird headspace, I didn't want to talk about this trip yet that

425
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,880
I had taken.

426
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,980
But now that I'm doing much better tonight, not that everything has been magically fixed,

427
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,160
I want to make sure that's very clear.

428
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,320
Not that everything has been magically fixed, but I'm in a better headspace than I was last

429
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
week.

430
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:22,080
And that's what it's all about for being able to prepare certain segments and so forth.

431
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:29,100
But two weeks ago, so we didn't have a show two weeks ago because I was out of town.

432
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,080
I was up in Seattle and I didn't say this in advance because I didn't know if it would

433
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,080
happen for sure.

434
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:40,960
And I don't like to talk things up unless I know I'm there and everything happened.

435
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:47,680
But I have a friend that I've known for a long time that actually a few months ago,

436
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,400
maybe a year ago, the pandemic has completely warped my sense of time, so I apologize, but

437
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,880
started working at the Pokemon Company International.

438
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,440
And they are actually headquartered out in the Seattle area.

439
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,720
So they're actually headquartered in Bellevue.

440
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,680
And something really cool that I got to do a couple weeks ago was I actually got to take

441
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,440
a little tour of the office.

442
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:15,040
Now, before you all make up your own narratives about what went on here, because this actually

443
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,880
would have been the week before Gen 9 came out.

444
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,800
No, I did not get to see Gen 9 early.

445
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,040
No, I did not see any work or any in progress things.

446
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,240
No, I don't know any secrets or things like that.

447
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,280
I got to tour an office building where people work and I didn't even get to see the cubes.

448
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:41,760
Okay, I only got to see the common spaces that were available, but part of the reason

449
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,640
why I share this with you all is that, especially for being a gamer, especially a gamer that

450
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,080
really enjoys Pokemon, these were some really cool offices to be able to see.

451
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,960
And this is also, it's not something that's open to the public.

452
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,880
You can't just say, I want to go get a tour of the office.

453
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,160
You can't exactly do that.

454
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:06,000
I happen to know somebody that was able to make this happen.

455
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,080
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, offices don't exist anymore anyway.

456
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,240
We all work from home.

457
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,200
You'll notice though, there's going to be some things here I'm going to show and I will

458
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,600
talk through this on the podcast.

459
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,600
I apologize.

460
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,480
I don't have the videos on the podcast, but you can always check the archives over at

461
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,200
twitch.tv slash a vog network where archives are accessible to subscribers over at twitch.tv

462
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,880
slash vog network.

463
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,640
Yeah, and Mike Deft also brings up a very good point.

464
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,880
These offices don't handle development itself, marketing and stuff like that.

465
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,880
While I am not privy to exactly what does and does not go on at this office, the sheer

466
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,820
amount of conference rooms that I saw in this place tell me that there's a lot of meetings,

467
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:52,600
be it clients, be it probably, you know, Japan, be it the fact that Nintendo is just located

468
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,000
down the road in Redmond, and so on and so on.

469
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,040
There's a lot of that stuff that goes on in these offices, absolutely.

470
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,360
So anyway, so yeah, and many folks are noticing in the lobby where I took this picture because

471
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,520
we had to get, you know, little special security stickers.

472
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,440
We also went in there on a Saturday, which was nice because it was really, really like

473
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,580
not bustling with people.

474
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,400
And I didn't want to feel like I was getting in the way.

475
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,280
I didn't want to have that imposter syndrome.

476
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,880
So it was actually really awesome being there on a Saturday where very, very few people

477
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,880
were there.

478
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,800
But we still had to get badged and all that good stuff to get in and see the stuff.

479
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,360
So yes, they have a little Detective Pikachu that sits in the front that is really cool.

480
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,560
So moving on and showing you some of the other things that we got to see there.

481
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:36,480
So this is also in the lobby where they actually have these really cool like vinyl figures,

482
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:44,000
life size of Pikachu, Squirtle, Charmander, Bulbasaur, right, the Gen 1 collection.

483
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,440
So yeah, DJ Rama S in chat says, friend of mine works for the Pokemon Company International.

484
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,200
He flies all over the country to help a localization of the anime.

485
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,760
Yeah, don't forget Pokemon is also much more than the games and you're going to see this

486
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
in a minute.

487
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,600
E3VL says, are they to scale?

488
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,020
I feel like they're actually bigger than scale.

489
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,800
But for the most part, yeah, I would say actually, yes, they are.

490
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,640
They are to scale because they were very big.

491
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,080
I'm not sure the picture that you see on stream really carries itself well, but these are

492
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,600
very large vinyl figures, which obviously it was very photogenic.

493
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,760
I also want to point out if you notice in the background of these photos, you can see

494
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,240
that we're very high up in a building.

495
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,540
Here's the interesting thing about where these offices are.

496
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,720
The first three floors of this building in Bellevue are a mall.

497
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,860
In fact, if you live in the Seattle area, you've probably been to this mall and didn't

498
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,040
even frickin realize that the Pokemon Company was in this building because I had been to

499
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,200
this mall in Bellevue.

500
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,720
There's a legendary dumpling place in this mall and I'm telling you, if you're in the

501
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,260
Seattle area, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

502
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,260
There's a legendary dumpling place in this mall that I went to with friends like six

503
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,420
years ago.

504
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,380
Going back on this trip gave me the weirdest deja vu.

505
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,780
So yeah, we're way up on the 25th, 26th, sorry.

506
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,340
I don't remember exactly what floor it's on.

507
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,020
I'm sure the back of video game manuals would tell you what floor it's on.

508
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,100
It's not like it's a super secret, but it's probably not something I should be sitting

509
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,220
here yapping about on air anyway.

510
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,220
Moving on.

511
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,220
Let's see.

512
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,220
Okay, I got to actually click to the next slide.

513
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,220
Fine.

514
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,260
Okay, I like this.

515
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,580
It's maybe a little hard to see on stream, but what I want to point out, I saw this is

516
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,580
cool.

517
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,860
This is like a common space where people can work and you get a really good sense of the

518
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,620
view in the back and you can actually see like downtown Seattle back there.

519
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:35,860
But they actually have this clear wall and on this clear wall, they have vinyl stickers

520
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,860
of the original sprites for all 151 original Pokemon.

521
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,260
And so that's what you actually see on the wall and it's in Pokedex order.

522
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:47,260
So you look at the upper left, you see Bulbasaur, Venusaur, so on and so on, or excuse me, Bulbasaur,

523
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:52,020
Ivysaur, Venusaur, sorry, Pokemon fans, and moving on through and all that good stuff.

524
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:56,940
So I thought this was a really cool little collection of little like vinyl sticker things

525
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,860
that were on this.

526
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,980
This I thought was one of the coolest rooms in the whole place.

527
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,260
And what we're looking at here, this is actually like a break room, right?

528
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,780
You can probably tell like, oh, it's like a, you know, they can see a little coffee

529
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,820
machine in there and stuff and counters and all that stuff.

530
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:16,420
The really cool thing about this is in the back where these diner style booths are that

531
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,300
you can sit and chat and have lunch together and so forth.

532
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:26,420
They actually have artwork of the Pokemon centers, but they're made in those tiles that

533
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:30,460
you see like in kitchens and diners, those little square tiles.

534
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,220
It makes up the pixel art.

535
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:38,820
And so it's actually pixel art of the Pokemon centers from every generation of Pokemon that

536
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:44,780
was pixelized that you can see the hall keeps going where my picture taking didn't go, but

537
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,380
they're all there in the area.

538
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,260
So, but I just thought this was a really cool little room and I was like, I want to take

539
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,260
my lunches here.

540
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,580
This is really cool.

541
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:59,260
So yeah, and bonds 006 says this looks like a few corporate or company office space I've

542
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,260
worked or been in.

543
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,260
Yeah.

544
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,500
At the end of the day, y'all it's an office space.

545
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,940
This was not, you know, like a play a demo space again.

546
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,840
That's not what I was there to do.

547
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,940
But it's a really like when I saw this, I was like, I want to work in this office space.

548
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,700
I'd go into the office more often if my office looked like this.

549
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,700
That's for sure.

550
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,700
All right.

551
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,760
This is one of the meeting rooms featuring one of my favorite Pokemon.

552
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:26,740
So this is actually is like a Pokemon that is, you'll notice the way it's kind of done

553
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:31,660
is that when the doors are closed, you actually can't really see into the meeting room.

554
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,340
And I'm sure there's a very good intent behind that.

555
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,880
And all of the meeting rooms, they're actually named after Pokemon.

556
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,580
So this one was the Lucario meeting room was one of my favorites.

557
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,780
You can actually see they actually have the artwork on the little reservation room and

558
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:49,060
you can actually see like, oh, yeah, this one, I believe on the other.

559
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,220
So Bobby Black Wolf notes that there's a rope.

560
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,820
The rope wasn't for the conference room.

561
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,260
I believe there was some type of large figurine there.

562
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,260
You can see it.

563
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,620
Look in the reflection of the office, and I'm not sure how it's coming over over stream.

564
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:06,780
But if you actually notice there in the reflection, you can see there are some large vinyl figures

565
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,460
that are on the other side of those ropes.

566
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,520
And that's what's actually roped off.

567
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,020
They probably just don't want people reaching over and touching them and getting their germs

568
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,840
on them, which is weird because this isn't exactly a public space.

569
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,800
The other thing again, you have to look really, really carefully in the reflection, you probably

570
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,740
notice a grid of things behind the Lucario.

571
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,520
It's because and you'll notice my reflection, they're taking the picture, which I didn't

572
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,900
realize, but that's right.

573
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,320
They actually have a trading card collection in the back there.

574
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:38,000
They have framed trading cards of I believe it is again, the pokey decks, but this time

575
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,920
it goes all the way through.

576
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:46,680
It's like eight or nine of these things hung up with a Pokemon trading card game card for

577
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,400
every one of the Pokemon in the deck starting from one.

578
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,400
So that yeah.

579
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,560
And Bobby says that's the national decks pretty much.

580
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
Yeah.

581
00:30:54,560 --> 00:31:00,640
But again, nothing Gen 9 was in there as it because we were in that awkward phase where

582
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,600
I was like, we all know the Gen 9 Pokemon because those leaks started.

583
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,120
But it's like, but officially we can't talk about that yet because the game hasn't launched.

584
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:16,360
So there's no Gen 9 stuff in the space, but I think it might be the next picture actually.

585
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,360
Yes.

586
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,560
The wall of plushies that actually shows, I don't know if this is like every plushie

587
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,240
that's been released, but I'll be darned if it doesn't feel like every plushie that's

588
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,120
been released that was in this wall.

589
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:34,160
There are no Gen 9, but my understanding was those were incoming pretty soon.

590
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,400
So when Gen 9 officially launched.

591
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,140
So yeah, but this was pretty cool.

592
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:44,800
This plushie wall, it had, I noticed the ditto versions of plushies.

593
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,320
There's a whole section of those and yeah, plushie, plushie heaven.

594
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,880
Honestly, it just looks like Shane's bedroom to be honest, except with not enough oshawots,

595
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,200
but otherwise there were lots of cool little plushies.

596
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,160
And yeah, they did have Pokemon Legends Arceus themed stuff in there, which was pretty cool.

597
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,200
So I liked the plushie wall.

598
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,080
It's hard to not like the plushie wall.

599
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,120
This room is another kind of break area and I thought this was really cool.

600
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,840
And it also shows that again, the Pokemon Company is about much more than just games

601
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:20,000
because they actually had a whole reading library, which features, as I understand it,

602
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,080
every Pokemon related book that's ever come out was in this room.

603
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,360
Even foreign language ones were in the back because I was looking at some that were in

604
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,560
French and so forth.

605
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,960
And I did look for the book, Come Out Squirtle, and it was there.

606
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,720
In fact, there was a whole series in that, which was pretty cool.

607
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,560
So yeah, I thought the reading library was really cool.

608
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,760
Obviously, they have rules posted.

609
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,120
Don't take books out of the room.

610
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:53,680
But I'm thinking, hey, as Rama said earlier, Rama has a friend that works with localization

611
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,160
and stuff.

612
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:59,040
And if I'm somebody that needs to be an expert on Pokemon lore because I'm working with topics

613
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:04,480
like that, it's awfully convenient to have this kind of library right where you're at.

614
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,240
So I thought this was very neat.

615
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,000
And one other thing that they had, you have to look really carefully at the top shelf

616
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:15,120
that you can see in this picture or just look at this next slide I have that actually has

617
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,160
some of the movie props from Detective Pikachu.

618
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:23,280
So I had to stand on my tiptoes to get this picture, but it actually has a little ticket

619
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,400
that they had with Rhyme City and a little map.

620
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,640
And they had one of the coffees from Hi Hat Cafe.

621
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,840
And I believe the Detective Pikachu that you saw in the front was also a Detective

622
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,000
Pikachu that was from the movie, although I think it was animated.

623
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,760
So maybe it was like a placeholder or something.

624
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,320
I don't know.

625
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,680
But I thought it was neat to see some of the movie props were there as well.

626
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,960
So that was a lot of fun.

627
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,760
So just a couple more.

628
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,680
This was Alan and I.

629
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,280
We were just, again, the view is beautiful.

630
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,880
And you can actually see in this particular picture, not only do you see the bay there

631
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,800
in Seattle, but you actually see there's this really circular park that's down below.

632
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,760
This is where we, after we were done with our tour, we actually went down to this park

633
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,960
to actually go play Pokemon Community Day, which was a lot of fun.

634
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,640
It was the Teddiursa day was that day.

635
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,040
And I caught a four star Pokemon at that park.

636
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,440
And it's loaded with Poke stops.

637
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,960
Like every memorial bench in that place was some type of Poke stop.

638
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,000
So yeah, that was my little tour of the building.

639
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,520
I had a lot of fun.

640
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,080
And I'm really, really thankful for the opportunity to kind of get to peek behind the curtain

641
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,800
a little bit.

642
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,280
At the end of the day, yes, it's an office building.

643
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,960
But it's, again, if I got to work in an office like that, I'd go in all the time.

644
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,320
That was a lot of fun.

645
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,200
So Zen Monkey says you guys look like Pokemon trainers.

646
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,320
Yeah, we were that day because we got to...

647
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,240
And actually, I think I had my Pogo Plus on me and I was catching stuff as we were walking

648
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:54,560
around.

649
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,320
So that was pretty cool.

650
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:56,960
So let's see.

651
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,600
Bond 006 says Sony Wonder Lab in New York City here would have past products detailing

652
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,880
the history of the company.

653
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,800
As you traverse the building, you would encounter a lot of sites that either locked to specific

654
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,360
regions and or from other markets.

655
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,600
Products not really stateside or from other countries.

656
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:17,280
Yeah, a little like that library I had mentioned had some of the books from other countries,

657
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,240
which I thought was really cool.

658
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,920
And Bobby Blackwell says that's why they make cool office spaces.

659
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,360
It's a selling point for recruitment.

660
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,000
Absolutely.

661
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,160
I didn't even get enough pictures of the whole because there were actually two floors we

662
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,800
got to see.

663
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,320
Alan got more pictures than I did, admittedly, because I'm one of those more like I want

664
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,120
to be in the moment.

665
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,280
But then I was like, I should probably take some pictures for OLR.

666
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,600
So that whole little space where that last photo was is actually like all like jungle

667
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,080
themed.

668
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,120
And it's supposed to be themed after like a Pokemon type of area.

669
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,240
And it did look really cool.

670
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,720
So it was pretty neat.

671
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,640
Mike Def says, I wonder if they have Pokemon fusion manga in there.

672
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,680
It never made it overseas.

673
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,120
Honestly, probably.

674
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,120
So I didn't look those like I can't 100% confirm or deny.

675
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,240
So She Hulk says, did you pick up a job application?

676
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,840
I can't relocate at this point.

677
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,640
We own a home here in Sacramento now, and that's it.

678
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,960
I enjoy my day job a lot.

679
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,040
I know I don't talk about it here on the program.

680
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,200
I do not work in the game industry, and I am okay with that.

681
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,600
My day job is a very boring.

682
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,280
And I say that in the best possible way.

683
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,480
Corporate job with a very boring corporate office.

684
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,160
I again say that the nicest possible way that doesn't look anything like what we just saw.

685
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,240
And I'm perfectly happy with where I'm at.

686
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:39,120
So no, I did not get a job application, but I'm thrilled for my friend who does work there

687
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,520
and obviously raves about it and was able to give us that opportunity and so forth.

688
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,560
And it was just a cool little extra little perk for our trip.

689
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,560
So awesome.

690
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,720
Bobby Lockwell says, do they need a corporate trainer?

691
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,880
Keep in mind, I don't do the training anymore.

692
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,800
I manage that.

693
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,520
So anyway, but not to get too into that.

694
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,280
So let's see.

695
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,280
Yeah, so thank you.

696
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,440
Thank you for the comments in our chat room there.

697
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,840
And yeah, thanks again for the tour.

698
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,720
And yeah, maybe next time I'm there, maybe they'll update some things and we'll get a

699
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,720
2.0 look at things.

700
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,760
So, all right.

701
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,880
In the meantime, let's move on.

702
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,480
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing

703
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,480
this week, whether it was Pokemon or something else.

704
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,760
Let's go to Loki.

705
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,640
How was your gaming week?

706
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,040
It was Minecraft.

707
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:34,320
I haven't gone back to play more of the Go Simulator 3 stuff.

708
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,840
My kid's been bugging me to do it though, because he's like 100% in the thing now.

709
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,140
Wow.

710
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,320
But yeah, I've been playing a lot of Minecraft.

711
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,040
I started obviously the modded series last week.

712
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,080
So did that and that's been fun.

713
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,960
Messed around with that.

714
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,520
And then I'm still working on stuff for Channel 64 as well.

715
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,920
I've been doing that like last few days.

716
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,080
So it's slow going.

717
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,720
I'm coming up on four weeks since I put out an actual video.

718
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:07,040
I mean, I did live stream in the middle there, but it's, you know, I'm cognizant of the time.

719
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,160
It keeps getting more complicated, the builds that I'm doing.

720
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,000
So it takes time.

721
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,800
But yeah.

722
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,840
And then, you know, more characters being designed.

723
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,640
I almost have all eight of my robot masters designed now.

724
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,800
So it's just, I think we're one left.

725
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,880
I think it'd be pretty cool.

726
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,360
So those have been being posted on Twitter and stuff.

727
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,680
But yeah, that's pretty much it.

728
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,480
It's been Minecraft.

729
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:33,780
All right.

730
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,040
My gaming week.

731
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,480
Again, I was out of town for a few days, as I'm sure a lot of people were off celebrating

732
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,520
the holidays in the States.

733
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,200
So I didn't play a lot of new stuff, but I continued on with some of the stuff I've been

734
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,760
playing.

735
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,600
So ironically, with Pokemon, I'm still been playing Pokemon Scarlet.

736
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,040
I keep on saying Scarlet and Violet, but technically I'm playing Pokemon Scarlet.

737
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,280
And I've been continuing on with that.

738
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,640
I am at two, two and two, which if you know the basics of the game, it isn't just gyms

739
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,280
now anymore.

740
00:38:59,280 --> 00:38:59,920
That's one part.

741
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,520
That's so I've beaten two gyms, but now there are star bases.

742
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,200
You can think Team Rocket.

743
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,720
You know, there's a new version of that.

744
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,920
The antagonist in every game.

745
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,880
This one's Team Star.

746
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,160
And I love some of the little sayings they have, like Hasta la vie star and the little

747
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,880
little gang sign they do as a little star.

748
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,600
It's super cute.

749
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:25,200
So I'm at two star bases and two Titan Pokemon, which is kind of a new thing where it's like,

750
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:31,680
it reminds me a little bit of there's a mechanic in another game like this, but it just basically

751
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,240
larger basically raid Pokemon that are out in the wild.

752
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,520
I don't know how else to describe it, but I've done two of those as well.

753
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,080
I have been keeping my playthrough to only on stream as well, which is part of the reason

754
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,840
why I'm a little slower going than some.

755
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,040
But I've been really enjoying playing on stream on stream this week.

756
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,840
The folks actually watched me run right by a shiny.

757
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,280
That's right.

758
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,080
I passed up.

759
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,680
I missed a fucking shiny until it was too late.

760
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,040
That that hurt, to be honest.

761
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,320
What can I say?

762
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,400
Actually, I want to see if I can actually get that clip as much as it pains me to play

763
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:10,900
this.

764
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:18,800
It was pretty interesting because I want to show you like just how easy this is to miss.

765
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,600
So how do I do this?

766
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,200
I'm going to go over to this monitor.

767
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,320
I'm going to make this large.

768
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,920
Okay, sorry, I'm doing some I'm doing some producing live on the fly here.

769
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,600
So and I'll describe this again for those in chat.

770
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,200
I'll just on the feed.

771
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,600
I'll just I'll describe what's happening.

772
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,200
Some of this audio is going to come through.

773
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,920
So let me I'm going to play the clip respond over there.

774
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,520
I'm fitting it for people.

775
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,020
Shut up.

776
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,840
Or you're next.

777
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,880
Give me your lunch money.

778
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,480
And that's where Shane says there was a shiny.

779
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,000
Did you see it?

780
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,480
Those of you watching on Twitch on this Sunday night.

781
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,440
Did you see the shiny?

782
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,480
Let me point out where the shiny was.

783
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,440
So the problem was me replay.

784
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,200
My eyes were here because I'm fixated on Oh, I'm sorry, you can't see me.

785
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,360
Okay, my eyes were in the center of the screen.

786
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:13,840
And I was fixated on the road ahead because I'm riding my little legendary Pokemon trying

787
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,560
to get back up the trail because I had fallen down or something.

788
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,120
It's something I didn't intend to do happened.

789
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:24,160
So as my eyes are over on this side of the screen, what happens is I'm running by.

790
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,560
It's really blink and you miss it.

791
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,200
Look, a pack of drift flumes comes up on the left.

792
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,320
And sure enough, one of them is a yellow shiny.

793
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,640
But because my eyes were over on the right side and not way on the left for that shiny

794
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,960
was I ended up running right by it.

795
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,480
And that that was that was how literally one second.

796
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:44,980
Shut up.

797
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,480
Or you're next.

798
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:46,960
And I missed it.

799
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,760
Give me your lunch money.

800
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,440
Y'all want to hear a sad story for the holidays, right?

801
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,040
Oh, well, it's just a shiny shiny Pokemon are stupid.

802
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,920
Anyway, that's Shane's thing.

803
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,640
That's not my thing.

804
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,680
That's a flower.

805
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,280
I know I know.

806
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,080
All right.

807
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,520
Anyway, so I was playing Pokemon and yeah, thank you.

808
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,400
F's in the chat.

809
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,360
I love F F as an unknown in the chat for Rob.

810
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,080
Thanks, Steph.

811
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,560
Appreciate it.

812
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,720
So yeah, I've been playing Scarlet and Violet and I've still been playing Dead by Daylight

813
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,280
a little bit.

814
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,920
It's the reason why that game still appears.

815
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,920
The reason why that game still appeals to me, even though, well, they did release new

816
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,120
content this last week.

817
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,280
They have a new killer, the Knight.

818
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,160
So the Knight's mechanic is that he can summon his friends.

819
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,400
He has the brotherhood and you actually trace these little routes and then your friends

820
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,080
patrol the routes.

821
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,920
And then if a survivor walks through him, the friend can actually damage him.

822
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,440
So it's kind of an interesting little twist.

823
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,200
So the Knight and then there's a new survivor as well, Vittorio.

824
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,200
And so, yeah, I've just been leveling up the new survivor in that game because I want to

825
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,320
get his perks because he has some really good perks that I want to get.

826
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,280
But yes, that's what's really it.

827
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,480
Pokemon Dead by Daylight.

828
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:58,960
That's it.

829
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,120
I haven't been playing a lot else this week because the holiday.

830
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,160
So all right, we'll get some more games next week for sure.

831
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,880
And I'll still be playing Pokemon on stream.

832
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,680
I did play a little vampire survivors.

833
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,120
Actually, I talked about that last week.

834
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,160
How I got back into that recently.

835
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,560
I think I did fire that up on like Monday or Tuesday night.

836
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,880
I did another run through on that game.

837
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:23,520
So that's the genre I'm feeling right now is those survivor games of which if you think

838
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,760
we haven't seen plenty yet, just wait.

839
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,880
Just wait next year.

840
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,320
It's going to be going to be the new thing.

841
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,600
It's not roguelikes.

842
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:34,960
It's which ironically, these survivor games are a derivative of roguelikes.

843
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,800
But that's that's going to be the big thing in the coming months for sure.

844
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,320
So all right, let's move on and get into some gaming news this week of which admittedly

845
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,840
there's not as much.

846
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:50,640
So we may not be here as long tonight, but we're going to get through what there there

847
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:57,040
is come out and a big one to start us off about a big game that came out a week ago

848
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,640
that everybody is still talking about.

849
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:09,440
And this is why the Pokemon company and Game Freak will never worry about quality in their

850
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,280
games because you folks will just buy them regardless.

851
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:19,120
Pokemon, Scarlet and Violet have sold over 10 million copies in the first weekend.

852
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,120
Congratulations.

853
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,720
You guys are part of the problem now.

854
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,600
And how about a 9.5 million of those are preorders?

855
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,200
Easy, easy.

856
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,640
I'm sure that they are.

857
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,120
But you know, it is what it is.

858
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:36,960
And that that's no one can complain about quality in those games now because you've

859
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,920
voted with your wallet.

860
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,440
So that's what you're going to get.

861
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:45,920
I I mean, yes, the game is buggy, but it like for me, it honestly doesn't ruin it.

862
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,280
I and I don't know if I'm at the point where I would say the bugs are charming.

863
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,640
Like I know you enjoy like driver just because it's one of those so bad buggy.

864
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,080
It's good type of games.

865
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:01,280
I'm not sure I would put Pokemon firmly in that camp, but the bugs are just like laughably

866
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,240
bad when they happen.

867
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,040
And then that's all it is.

868
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,040
I laugh it off because it doesn't break my game.

869
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,200
I have heard there are game breaking bugs.

870
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:13,520
It hasn't happened to me and I auto save enough where I feel like I don't even if a breaking

871
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,560
bug happened to me, I don't think it would really shut me down.

872
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,000
But I don't know.

873
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,800
Like I I don't want to say I'm totally reminded of the Mass Effect Andromeda issues because

874
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,360
here here's also a great example.

875
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,680
Mass Effect Andromeda released three days early to a certain audience.

876
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,200
So all of this hit the Internet so everybody could say stop and wait.

877
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:38,400
Nintendo, on the other hand, keeps this shit under iron lock and fucking key until this

878
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,280
game comes out.

879
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,440
Now, they didn't stop leaks from happening.

880
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,040
So there were news out there about the games being a little bit buggy.

881
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:50,000
But I don't think I don't even think the leakers knew the full extent of like all the crazy

882
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,800
things you could do in the game until the games were out.

883
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:58,080
But it you know, and I said this back then with Mass Effect Andromeda, EA's huge mistake

884
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,320
was being greedy with that online program and letting people play that game three days

885
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:02,640
early.

886
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,840
That is that is one of the biggest mistakes EA has ever made.

887
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,400
Quite honestly, because I mean, once they release the game, especially a month after

888
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,480
when they fix the bugs, the game is fine.

889
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:21,040
But it's Yeah, well, it's it's it's perpetuating the problem, though, that we have where it's

890
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,200
okay now for these companies to release games that are clearly not ready for launch.

891
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:32,080
And that's the problem is, is whether it's motivation by we just got to get it out before

892
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:38,400
holiday sales happen, or we're, you know, incentivized, which isn't good enough, or

893
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,720
the switch isn't good enough, you know, it could be some of that, that I would still

894
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,760
argue, though, that other games have run more smoothly, it's I think it's less that it's

895
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:55,840
more or less optimized game is more impacted by the switches, not cutting edge performance

896
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,480
anymore.

897
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:02,160
And so whereas some games, you know, on other causes could get by with not being optimized

898
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:02,880
as much.

899
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,800
It does affect it when you're having to really squeeze every ounce of power and performance

900
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,840
out of this console.

901
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:13,600
Yeah, it's not, you know, it's, it's unfortunate.

902
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,840
Like, there's a lot of games where I would have given it a pass, you know, if it's like

903
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:24,560
extremely buggy and stuff, but it's, it's becoming a point now where we I don't think

904
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,760
we can do that anymore.

905
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,720
Because there's just so many games that we hear about coming out being broken and buggy.

906
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,120
And it's because we're sending the message just pre ordering and buying these games,

907
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:40,160
you know, without knowing what we're getting into the where they're just like, how many

908
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,840
stories have we heard about different companies putting out roadmaps about how they're going

909
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,560
to fix their game?

910
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,400
It's ridiculous.

911
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,520
I get I get messages on Facebook all the time I see because I follow Saints Row on there

912
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,880
about how they're all over or we're working on our performance something something like

913
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,160
I don't even care anymore.

914
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:04,640
Like I just don't because it's like so far out past launch and you're still fixing the

915
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:09,200
game that was released in the state like I don't know.

916
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,600
All right, and this it looks bad for Nintendo, I think, but I think it looks bad for the

917
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,160
switch.

918
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:19,040
I you know, I put a lot of the blame on the switch being antiquated hardware is the Nintendo

919
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:24,160
probably has to I would say that they can't take the stance of like, well, we're just

920
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,200
going to be a new couple generations behind performance.

921
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,840
I don't think you should be doing that anymore.

922
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,040
There's effects.

923
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,200
Well, I was just say there's some important comments in chat I want to read.

924
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:38,480
First off quest Buster who brings up I think another one of those franchises that gets

925
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,880
away with his bugs and it's because they're adorable.

926
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:47,680
Quest Buster says for me Bethesda's Elder Scrolls RPGs like Skyrim are notoriously buggy,

927
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,440
but I slog through those because I was still able to enjoy them quite a bit.

928
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,360
Still would love to see them improve their bug squashing though, hopefully with Starfield.

929
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:00,800
I think that is a great analogy because a lot of people will defend Skyrim and those

930
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,680
games release in really sad buggy states, but you kind of let it slide because it's

931
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,120
a great story and a great game.

932
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,160
Well, but in that is almost the same.

933
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:16,480
It's it's a similar situation too, because you're talking about Skyrim, which is running

934
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,120
on old engine hard.

935
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,320
I mean, the engine is the thing that is old in that now.

936
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,480
Yeah, I've been used in multiple games.

937
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,520
And so you see a lot of their modern games that they're putting out.

938
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,840
They're still using that really old engine at being really buggy.

939
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:37,360
Fallout 76, Fallout 4, like all of that stuff is still very buggy because they're using

940
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:44,160
outdated engines to build this same thing can happen with, you know, using outdated

941
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,040
hardware.

942
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,360
It's you're going to run into bottlenecks somewhere, whether that be the engine that

943
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:53,440
you programmed where I can't do the efficiencies I want because it just doesn't support it

944
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,840
anymore or just whatever.

945
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:02,560
And yeah, it story and the rest of the polish of the game does matter as far as like being

946
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,560
accepting what you'll look past.

947
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:09,440
Yeah, and that's and that's really what it and Mike Deaf says it in chat here is that

948
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,840
the bugs aren't game breaking for the most part, but the game is genuinely fun and great.

949
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,000
And honestly, from my perspective, I have to agree, like both those things can be true.

950
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,640
I can sit here and say, yeah, the bugs are really disappointing.

951
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,800
Like the fact that there are so many technical glitches still in the game, it's disappointing.

952
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,880
And the fact that the switch is very obviously antiquated hardware at this point is disappointing.

953
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,400
All that can be true.

954
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:35,520
And I can still say, but damn, this game, I love what the open world stuff did for Pokemon.

955
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:41,200
I really like it took a few hours of gameplay to really grow me because at first I wasn't

956
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,080
sure because it was just so different from sword and shield.

957
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:48,000
But damn, now that I spent a couple hours with it, I'm like, I really love what the

958
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,680
open world stuff has done for Pokemon.

959
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,840
And I really can't wait to see where it goes.

960
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:57,520
Hopefully, the next generation on a like, swear to God, Gen 10 better not be for the

961
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,320
switch.

962
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,720
Gen 10 needs to be for the next Nintendo hardware.

963
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,960
And I'm really looking forward to that.

964
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,160
Actually, what I'm really, really looking forward to is the next Pokemon Legends game

965
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,760
because they better fucking do one.

966
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,600
And it also better not be on the switch.

967
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,200
Because I want to see what they can do with more advanced hardware.

968
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,280
Yeah, I'm just worried that like the the message that we're sending with that stuff in don't

969
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,840
get me wrong, like, like I get it a great game.

970
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,480
So it could be great, even though it has bugs in it and stuff.

971
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,240
But also, like there are there were some glaring bugs.

972
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,040
It's not like that.

973
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,000
Oh, hey, I did this weird thing that normally people don't do it.

974
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,360
It was an untested case that we found some bugs and stuff like that.

975
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:37,600
We're talking like very blatant, very performance based bugs that they knew that they

976
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,480
need to iron out.

977
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,880
And I hope that they will eventually iron out.

978
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,520
But some executives, some corporate executives at Game Freak made the decision that we're

979
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,840
going to release this in the state that it is now.

980
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,400
Yeah.

981
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,480
And so that's what you have to keep in mind is that they made that mistake and they're

982
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,200
like, well, I don't know, maybe the fans might not take to it.

983
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,640
And now that you took to it, they're going to be like, oh, well, next time, you know,

984
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,360
it it's not in perfect polished shape, but we're just going to release it anyways.

985
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,120
And I worry that it's going to get worse.

986
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,760
Yeah, I have with other franchises.

987
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,120
Yeah, that kind of thing happened.

988
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,040
That is an industry problem.

989
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,480
I absolutely agree with that.

990
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,400
And it's one of those things where oftentimes people want to say, oh, the industry has this

991
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,240
problem, but not Nintendo, not Nintendo.

992
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:18,800
They're there.

993
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,280
And I understand Pokemon is technically not a Nintendo game, but we literally just had

994
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,920
Loki say it is Nintendo's biggest franchise officially as so.

995
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,080
So yes, Pokemon and Nintendo are very much embedded together.

996
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,520
It is a Nintendo company.

997
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,080
I'm sorry.

998
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:34,960
Yeah, I know.

999
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:40,720
Do we publish Pokemon games on other platforms, other console platforms, iOS, Android, Nintendo

1000
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,920
company, iOS, Android?

1001
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,520
That is not a console.

1002
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,600
That is that is mobile games.

1003
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,320
I'm sorry.

1004
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,040
That doesn't count.

1005
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,120
It's it is a Nintendo company.

1006
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,280
It may be like a second party company.

1007
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,720
However, we want to distinguish it.

1008
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,560
But it is a company that makes games that are featured.

1009
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,480
And it's not only Nintendo game.

1010
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,360
It's not just go.

1011
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,120
It's Pokemon cafe.

1012
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,280
There's, I think, a trading card thing that's there too.

1013
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,160
So Pokemon does have a mobile space.

1014
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,840
But I get what you're saying.

1015
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,800
But yeah, you know, Loki and I will agree with what you're saying.

1016
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,240
This is an industry problem.

1017
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,560
And it's one that this game is exhibit A.

1018
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,160
Nintendo is not immune to it.

1019
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,760
We release games in buggy states because we need them to be out by a certain day.

1020
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,920
And that's what it is.

1021
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,080
By the way, an interesting fix that I read about and I haven't had a chance to test this

1022
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:34,640
yet, but I did notice that my game was running off of the SD card because that's where the

1023
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,400
game chose to install by default was my expansion SD card.

1024
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,120
Apparently, if you copy the game from the SD card, move it, I guess move it from the

1025
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:46,880
SD card to the system hardware, it will function better.

1026
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,320
I'm not sure why that is.

1027
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,320
It's not like these cards are plate drives that are spinning up that are causing lag.

1028
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,800
But I could see that even a couple microseconds of lag is lag.

1029
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,720
So I did move the game over to the system.

1030
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:06,000
I did that in some downtime because I actually did play a little bit off stream.

1031
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,640
But all I did off stream was I went to the academy and started advancing all those classes

1032
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,080
you can go to, like do some of that stuff that's just like pushing A to read through

1033
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,200
quest text over and over.

1034
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:19,520
I did some of that stuff off stream so I could not have to spend time on stream doing it.

1035
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,160
And so before I did that, I moved the game over because apparently that is supposed to

1036
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,120
reduce the bugs.

1037
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,880
I don't know if that's just urban legend at this point or what it is.

1038
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,720
No, I would imagine that that's probably a thing because it's the same.

1039
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,480
It's like when we were talking about running games off disk drives and installing to your

1040
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,000
hard drive back in the Xbox 360 days or PlayStation three days.

1041
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,120
Yeah, it's it's the drive speeds are it could even be the SD speeds are faster.

1042
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:53,440
You know, whether you have, you know, on on hardware flash RAM or whatever flash ROMs

1043
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:58,640
that you have in there that you can store that data to versus reading through an SD

1044
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,680
card slot, which is bottlenecked by, you know, that process as well.

1045
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,640
The bus on that.

1046
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,160
So it's it is very possible that that is the case.

1047
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,520
But that also goes back to that the hardware is not powerful enough.

1048
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:17,600
Also, the game's not optimized enough to be able to, you know, cache that basically loading

1049
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,160
in that data.

1050
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:22,480
That's why you have pop in and some of these open world games is because it can't read

1051
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:22,960
the data.

1052
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:29,040
They don't have it compressed enough or, you know, doing LEDs, whatever it might take to

1053
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,080
load that stuff in there.

1054
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:34,800
They're not doing it in an efficient enough manner because the hardware can't keep up

1055
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,280
with it.

1056
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,400
So either you either optimize the hell out of it to, you know, work on the, you know,

1057
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:47,200
lesser than ideal powered hardware, or you get more powerful hardware to run your game.

1058
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,520
Mike Defton chat says portable mode and installed on the console does run better.

1059
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,360
I personally tested it interesting.

1060
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:58,400
And then some other folks, multiple people in chat pointing out that SD cards can vary

1061
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,440
in speed.

1062
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:04,320
So it could also be a reason why it causes some of the issues that'll be interesting

1063
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:09,520
to see how much of an improvement I notice moving it to the but that just FYI, if you

1064
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:14,000
hadn't heard that yourself, and you're a Pokemon scarlet or violet player, that's a tip.

1065
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,280
Don't run it off the SD card.

1066
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,960
If you can help it, move it to the main console, you can you can use data management, your

1067
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,480
options and kind of move things around.

1068
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:24,480
You can even even uninstall things to download them later if you don't have a bandwidth cap

1069
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,120
to worry about.

1070
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,720
But I was able to pretty easily move things around to make that work.

1071
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,240
Your mileage may vary.

1072
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,120
Now I wanted to move to this story real quick.

1073
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,800
I know you probably have one other thing.

1074
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,960
Did you have one other thing you want to get out Logie with this?

1075
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,880
Yeah, just so that people are seeking refunds.

1076
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,880
I mean, yeah, if you're unhappy with the state of the games, and then sure, go seek

1077
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:43,520
refund.

1078
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,560
Yeah, I mean, that's just common sense, I would say.

1079
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:51,280
Well, the fact that they're getting them from Nintendo is the news there, in my opinion.

1080
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,040
This isn't a steam game.

1081
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,240
This is an epic store game.

1082
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,200
It's a Nintendo game, who are notoriously hard asses.

1083
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:06,400
I mean, I guess it's but it's not like, because I don't think it's unheard of.

1084
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,560
I mean, they know the state that it's in.

1085
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,080
They're not completely like what the games release in this.

1086
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,280
They know.

1087
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,080
I mean, come on.

1088
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,200
DJI who says, wait, Nintendo is giving out refunds.

1089
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:22,800
Apparently, yes, we are hearing cases of refunds, but we don't we don't know the policy.

1090
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,760
Nintendo has not come out to state any sort of policy.

1091
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:30,480
And they probably won't, knowing Nintendo, but I guarantee they're not going to.

1092
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,320
So we're really left off of tweets and Reddit posts.

1093
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:38,000
And you know, it's up to you how much faith you want to put in that type of stuff.

1094
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,720
Ironically, I have something about a Reddit post.

1095
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,760
So again, I'm just going to state this is from a Reddit post.

1096
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,000
So I'm not even sure if it's true or not.

1097
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,920
But I want to you know, it's a slower Newsweek.

1098
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,040
And it's one of those interesting things where I wouldn't be surprised if it's true.

1099
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:02,640
Apparently, one player on Reddit decided to go to Nintendo's customer support and revealed

1100
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,480
the response that they received.

1101
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:10,000
The employee claimed this was the first they'd heard about any issues with the games.

1102
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:13,440
And there are no patches or updates in place to fix the problems.

1103
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,160
This has now turned way I gotta say that.

1104
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:16,400
Hold on.

1105
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:16,720
Hold on.

1106
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,920
Look, I see the face you're making.

1107
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:18,880
I need to get through this.

1108
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,100
Sure.

1109
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,200
Number one.

1110
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:28,560
Now that is the headline that is running rampant through the industry is Nintendo does not

1111
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:31,760
plan to address Pokemon and Scarlet Violet issues.

1112
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:36,720
That is that that that is a bad headline to run.

1113
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,160
I'm going to tell you why.

1114
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,440
I guarantee this customer service support.

1115
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,080
They have a book, they have a Bible, they have a line, they have to stick to it.

1116
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:49,680
I'm not saying the line that they have to stick to is to lie about the technical support

1117
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:50,480
with the game.

1118
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,440
But the line they have to stick to is there are no patches at this time plan for Scarlet

1119
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,080
and Violet.

1120
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,280
They can't come out and say, Oh, yeah, well, we'll give that to the team to do a patch.

1121
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:04,400
Well, they they can only say what they can say and they can only know what they know,

1122
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:10,080
which one week after the game is out during the Thanksgiving holiday in the US is take

1123
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,920
away not fucking much.

1124
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:19,360
So this is a really shitty headline to pull out of a Reddit story interaction with customer

1125
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:24,320
service who doesn't have the script to deal with the situation yet.

1126
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,440
That is the reality.

1127
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:32,160
So, but now and then people are saying no, no complaints have been filed about Scarlet

1128
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:36,160
Violet, that part I actually would see is true.

1129
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:43,760
Why why complain through the proper channels when you can just bitch about it on social

1130
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,160
media?

1131
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:51,440
So the Reddit Redditor says I filed a complaint about Scarlet Violet performance with Nintendo

1132
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,240
support today.

1133
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,680
And I encourage anyone who has had issues with the frame rate clipping game crashes,

1134
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,480
stuttering, lagging, etc to file a complaint as well.

1135
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,000
That is the part of the story I would actually agree with.

1136
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:07,520
If you really feel passionately about it, register a formal complaint that is going

1137
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,440
to force Nintendo's hand more than anything.

1138
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:09,920
Oh, God.

1139
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:14,480
Now I'm just realizing as I'm reading through this entire post, I was able to speak with

1140
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:21,600
a real person in the chat feature that everything I just said 60 seconds ago, even worse chat

1141
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,560
feature.

1142
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:30,160
I I can't prove it, but I would almost certainly I would bet money it's offshored.

1143
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,360
And those folks really have a script on what they can and can't say.

1144
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:42,240
So Mike Deaf says let me guess Kotaku actually no, but I'm not surprised they ran with the

1145
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:42,960
headline either.

1146
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,800
This particular article I got pointed to is from the gamer.com.

1147
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:51,200
But I'm telling you, put it in Google News, you'll find 50 start sites that turn this

1148
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,880
Reddit post during a slow newsweek into a headline.

1149
01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:01,520
And again, there are some pieces of this that I do think are worth saying.

1150
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:06,400
So the one part where I will say, yes, Redditor, you're right, is filing a complaint about

1151
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,160
Scarlet Violet performance with Nintendo.

1152
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,520
That is the only way something will actually get done about the situation.

1153
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,240
But this whole customer service told me this.

1154
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,760
Therefore, it must be true.

1155
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,280
And I don't fault the Redditor for this.

1156
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,720
This isn't me picking on them.

1157
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:25,440
This is me just saying the reality is you're talking to customer service who is probably

1158
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:31,440
contracted with a company, Nintendo, that is not even the company that made Pokemon.

1159
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,520
But again, we all associate them with it contracted.

1160
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,560
You are literally talking to a ditto of a ditto.

1161
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:42,320
And I'm not even intending to use Pokemon terms, but I guess I did.

1162
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:46,560
You are talking to a ditto of a ditto, probably a ditto of a ditto of ditto, because there's

1163
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:49,280
probably another contractual agreement between offshore and the customer service.

1164
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,320
You're talking three dittos deep with customer service.

1165
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:59,200
Of course, they don't have shit to say to you, but they'll register their ticket in

1166
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,400
Salesforce and somebody will get back to you in seven to ten days.

1167
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:09,600
Mike Defton chat says, as a person who worked at customer service calls for a US company,

1168
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,120
scripts are the name of the game.

1169
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,040
And remind us where you live, Mike Deft, Mexico.

1170
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:15,540
Yep.

1171
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,840
Fifth Dream says, yeah, contracted with a third party even, so they don't even technically

1172
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,880
work for Nintendo.

1173
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,040
And it's Game Freak's game, not Nintendo's game.

1174
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,480
So we're three dittos deep.

1175
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,000
SSG100Matt says, a mimic you of a ditto.

1176
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:29,540
Yeah.

1177
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,280
Tiger Claw says, you probably are talking to someone from India.

1178
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:38,080
Perhaps could be the Philippines, could be a number of offshore places that are very

1179
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:38,880
popular.

1180
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,480
It could be another part of the US.

1181
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,560
Sometimes offshore is still within the US.

1182
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,120
I'm not going to make that stuff up right now in the moment.

1183
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:51,280
But all I'm going to say is, again, as far as reporting off customer service statements

1184
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:56,400
go, gaming journalists of the world do not report on customer service interactions.

1185
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,200
It is not news.

1186
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:58,980
It's not.

1187
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,360
You all should know better.

1188
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,600
How fucking long have these websites been around?

1189
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:09,120
Making articles based off of like a Reddit post is kind of lame anyways, or the ones

1190
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,440
that report off of like a single tweet.

1191
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:15,760
Have you ever really looked at those Facebook ads you get all the time?

1192
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:20,160
They are all like it's you would never believe what happened to these 10 celebrities.

1193
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,360
Number five will shock you.

1194
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:26,000
And it is literally all Reddit posts compiled into a news story.

1195
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,040
This is like where journalism is at these days is Reddit posts.

1196
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,480
It's and tweets.

1197
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,320
Tweets is the other big one as well.

1198
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:36,800
Y'all know I have some strong feelings about Twitter and how really tweets should not be

1199
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:43,920
news at this point, because we know that, you know, literally they will let little literally

1200
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,760
anyone back on Twitter.

1201
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:54,000
And by verification for eight dollars, so gaming industry, if you're going to report

1202
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:00,400
on tweets from here on out, that's y'all's ass like that's y'all's ass.

1203
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:05,840
We as podcasters, you, me, Dark Sakura, everybody out there that wants to have a respectable

1204
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:06,720
gaming podcast.

1205
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,880
And I say I say this full on self-aware.

1206
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,720
We have made this mistake in the past.

1207
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,640
So I'm going to own those mistakes in the past.

1208
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:18,320
I'm going to say moving forward, we need to fucking watch if we report on Reddit posts

1209
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:18,960
and tweets.

1210
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,040
And if we do, we need to say so.

1211
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,720
So we can take it with a big grain of salt.

1212
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,760
And that's why I started this was saying take this with a grain of salt because it comes

1213
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,480
from a Reddit post.

1214
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,360
No offense to Reddit.

1215
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,320
I love Reddit.

1216
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:30,820
Most of it.

1217
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,680
There's some pretty shitholes in Reddit, but most of Reddit.

1218
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:36,480
I really enjoy.

1219
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:42,240
And, you know, you do get a lot of really interesting stories and you get a lot of people

1220
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,760
willing to tell you things on Reddit because they can hide behind a name that they wouldn't

1221
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,120
say, you know, somewhere else.

1222
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,840
So it does lead to some fascinating stuff sometimes.

1223
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,880
That's for sure.

1224
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,480
So let's see.

1225
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,120
Looking in chat.

1226
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,200
SHO 100 Matt says the logic is like I talked to a DIS customer support person in a chat

1227
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,400
window about DW.

1228
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,520
I'm assuming Disney World.

1229
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,040
So I spoke to Bob Iger.

1230
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,200
Yeah, did your own?

1231
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,000
Oh, excuse me.

1232
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,280
Quest Buster says, Yes, YouTube, you won't believe what happened in X Games Syndrome.

1233
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:18,960
Oh, God, you want to talk about another cesspool of Reddit posts becoming clickbait to get

1234
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:19,600
your ads?

1235
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,120
It's that.

1236
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:25,280
So anyway, just throwing that out there.

1237
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,240
Just throwing that out there.

1238
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,120
Okay, let's move on.

1239
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,800
Let's change the topic a little bit.

1240
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,480
Let's talk about other parts of Nintendo that make us scream internally.

1241
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,640
Loki or externally, thanks to Loki.

1242
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:43,200
Yes, Nintendo and their litigious side.

1243
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,320
Of course, you got to love it.

1244
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:52,800
So Nintendo is now coming after people with DMCA takedowns regarding fan created steam

1245
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,440
icons.

1246
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,560
It's a user database called Steam Grid DB.

1247
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:04,560
And I believe custom icons that you can get for I'm assuming big picture mode and for

1248
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:08,880
different like games that you want to have in your library that maybe you obviously steam

1249
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,240
doesn't have in the library.

1250
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:14,880
So you can use those or maybe you just want to put legends of the breath of the wild on

1251
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,040
among us or something like that.

1252
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:17,760
I don't know.

1253
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:25,760
But it is allowing you to basically, you know, put those different game cover arts or whatever

1254
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,120
on or you can import them into your library.

1255
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:34,880
Well, now they're, they're, of course, doing copyright notices, because, you know, there's

1256
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,120
official artwork in there from Nintendo, and they don't want it to be related to with a

1257
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:47,200
site that is not facilitating emulation, per se, but it's just like, we're adding some

1258
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,480
dressing to your emulation that you're doing, I guess.

1259
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:58,080
So right now, they are taking down just basically anything that's using display Nintendo characters

1260
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:04,080
or intellectual property that could be likely to lead consumer confusion.

1261
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,960
And then of course, this has been the site has actually taken some of the stuff down as well.

1262
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,480
And right now, they're not kind of going after stuff.

1263
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,680
It's like fan art.

1264
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,400
But I mean, I wouldn't rule that out at this point.

1265
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:20,960
I don't know.

1266
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,760
I'm not surprised.

1267
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,440
But also, like, really,

1268
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,120
you brought up fan art.

1269
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:30,400
And I'm waiting for the day when Nintendo sues one of those fan boosts at a convention

1270
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,480
or something that's producing artwork based I mean, they let's be real, we know they've

1271
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:40,160
turned a big, you know, they've turned their back big time to that sort of thing.

1272
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,840
And they don't look directly at it.

1273
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,560
And we all we all worry when that shoe is going to drop.

1274
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,240
But maybe they also realize that something like that.

1275
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,520
Maybe that is where they know the line is that that really would do more harm than good.

1276
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,840
But well, yeah, I'm all that stuff.

1277
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,280
All that stuff is on borrowed time.

1278
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,840
Let's just let's just be real artists in the world.

1279
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,280
I'm being real with you.

1280
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,240
Love what you do.

1281
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:00,880
Love your work.

1282
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,240
Love your interpretations.

1283
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,000
Y'all are on borrowed time.

1284
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:12,080
Well, just I don't know, I think I think nothing will happen to Nintendo is what I think.

1285
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:16,880
Honestly, like at this point, they can release buggy games, they can be litigious like crazy.

1286
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:18,340
Do we not?

1287
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:23,920
Do we not remember that not literally a few years ago, they had a process where you couldn't

1288
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:29,120
even make YouTube videos unless you signed up with their service, and then they would

1289
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,640
still take all their ad revenue.

1290
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,320
This is a company that you're dealing with.

1291
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,440
You guys all love them.

1292
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:36,640
You're going to buy their games no matter what we're going to do literally whatever

1293
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,320
they want, and you're going to just eat it up.

1294
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:42,880
So I will say, Logie, there is how quickly we forget.

1295
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:46,800
Gamers have also shown they are willing to not buy Nintendo.

1296
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,480
Wii U says hello.

1297
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:50,580
So.

1298
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:55,680
You know, yes, they've had the magic touch with the switch and the Wii and, you know,

1299
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:56,000
Liza.

1300
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,760
But let's be real, Loki.

1301
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,920
The Wii U is a blemish on Nintendo.

1302
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,760
Yeah, one that's like decades old, though.

1303
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,400
So I mean, decades, not decades.

1304
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,200
It feels that.

1305
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,400
Stop the revisionist history.

1306
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,280
You read that on Reddit.

1307
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,640
How old I feel.

1308
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,280
Okay, well, that that I accept.

1309
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,160
It's one console.

1310
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:20,080
Like, I don't think it matters.

1311
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,560
It really doesn't matter at this point, because that's in the past.

1312
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:23,060
Yeah.

1313
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:24,420
All right.

1314
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,840
Well, moving on to something maybe less controversial.

1315
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:28,160
I don't know.

1316
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,880
I think I think this is DLC that doesn't ruffle a lot of feathers.

1317
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,080
I will say that actually, let's let's be real.

1318
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,120
We've had a lot of of hard feedback for Nintendo.

1319
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:39,920
I'm going to spotlight something I think Nintendo does very well.

1320
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,240
I think Nintendo does DLC very well.

1321
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:46,720
I think they are almost ahead of almost any other company I

1322
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:50,160
can think of off the top of my head when it comes to DLC and

1323
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:53,040
the robustness and the richness and the quality of what you

1324
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:53,760
get in DLC.

1325
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:59,200
And we know that Mario Kart 8 is getting a lot of DLC lately,

1326
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:04,800
and they're getting a new booster course pass with Wave 3

1327
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:05,760
is coming out.

1328
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,200
And Wave 3 of the booster course pack will include the

1329
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:13,280
Rock Cup and the Moon Cup, which includes London Loop from

1330
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:17,520
Mario Kart Tour, Boo Lake from GBA, Rock Rock Mountain from

1331
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,280
3DS, Maple Treeway from the Wii, and then the Moon Cup is

1332
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:24,080
Berlin Byways, also from Mario Kart Tour.

1333
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,480
I'm glad Mario Kart Tour can do something for the franchise,

1334
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,480
because it's single handedly.

1335
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,320
I think every track for that game is going to end up in this

1336
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:30,820
DLC.

1337
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:36,400
Peach Gardens from the DS, Merry Mountain, which was also

1338
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:40,080
from Mario Kart Tour, and Rainbow Road, the 3DS version.

1339
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,600
So if you don't already have the booster course pass, you

1340
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,360
can get that for 25 bucks.

1341
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,160
And that is for all six sets, 48 new tracks.

1342
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:53,040
This particular set will be coming out December 7th, so

1343
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,240
pretty soon.

1344
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:56,240
So there it is.

1345
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:57,840
Mario Kart 8 DLC.

1346
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:02,800
I gotta admit, this is a very typical middle of the pack.

1347
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,120
I'm not sure if I'm excited about anything in this,

1348
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,080
particularly.

1349
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:07,680
None of these courses.

1350
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,960
I remember the Maple Treeway.

1351
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:09,920
That one was all right.

1352
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,640
And actually, the Merry Mountain does look pretty cool,

1353
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,800
because it has a Christmas train that goes through it and

1354
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,360
stuff.

1355
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,240
And so it gives me big, like, what was that course on

1356
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,800
Nintendo 64 that has the train in it?

1357
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,320
It gives me big that vibes.

1358
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,920
So it was just in the last DLC.

1359
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,600
Yeah, I was gonna say that course in the last one.

1360
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,320
Desert.

1361
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:28,820
Yeah.

1362
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,560
But this one, I'm pretty sure many of you already plunked

1363
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,800
down the money for the six pack course.

1364
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,160
These will be new courses to play at your Christmas

1365
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:41,840
gatherings and other holiday gatherings, of course, too.

1366
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,600
I don't want to neglect any other holidays out there.

1367
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:48,880
But yeah, I don't think there's nothing in here that jumps

1368
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,800
to me like, wow, I've got to have that.

1369
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,200
It's not like Waluigi pinballs in this one.

1370
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,000
That was in the last one.

1371
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,560
It's kind of disappointing to like, I get it.

1372
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,640
Like, and then maybe they're saving it for Mario Kart 9

1373
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,120
or whatever the case may be, even though they are making

1374
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,040
like stuff throughout, I think, next year, too.

1375
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,640
It is disappointing to see that they haven't really made

1376
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:10,080
any tracks based off, like Odyssey or anything like that.

1377
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,600
Like, I think that would be really cool.

1378
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,560
New tracks is basically what you're saying.

1379
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:15,280
You want new tracks?

1380
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:15,680
Yeah.

1381
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:15,920
Yeah.

1382
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,320
New tracks, not just porting over everything.

1383
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:22,400
We did get one or two new tracks in the first and second pack.

1384
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:26,000
I don't know if they were just probably Mario Kart tour.

1385
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,720
I bet a lot of these new maps are Mario Kart tour maps that

1386
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,840
got repurposed or they were going to be for tour.

1387
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,480
And then they decided, no, we're going to move it over here.

1388
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,920
So but, you know, I have no proof.

1389
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,160
That's just, you know, old man insight.

1390
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,000
So, yeah.

1391
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,920
But yeah, I think we deserve Mario Kart 9.

1392
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:51,600
But at this point, I hope Mario Kart 9 is a launch title

1393
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,560
for the next system.

1394
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,200
And I would think that would be a hell of a launch title

1395
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,040
for a successor to the Switch.

1396
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:01,040
I think that would be a hell of a launch title, especially

1397
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,920
if a Zelda game is not going to be ready, which unless you

1398
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:07,840
want to buy into the rumors that, you know, I keep wanting

1399
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,200
to say Breath of the Wild 2, but it has a name now.

1400
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,520
The Weeping is the Breath of the Wild 2.

1401
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:15,440
Oh, my God.

1402
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,720
I can't remember the name of something.

1403
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:17,760
Tears of the Kingdom.

1404
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:22,400
Tears of the Kingdom is going to be dual whatever, whatever.

1405
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,720
But we'll see.

1406
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:25,840
Thank you.

1407
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,480
Thank you, chat.

1408
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:30,160
Yes, because that's never, like, backfired on a system ever.

1409
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,640
A dual release.

1410
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,400
I mean, Breath of the Wild was a Wii U game.

1411
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,240
I understand that.

1412
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,240
And it's probably held back because of that.

1413
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,680
It's hard to look at a game like Breath of the Wild and say

1414
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,680
it's held back at all, though, to be honest.

1415
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:51,840
Like, that game is still holding up as one of the best games

1416
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,600
that's on the Switch at this point.

1417
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,880
So we'll see.

1418
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:55,840
All right.

1419
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:57,440
Moving on, Loki.

1420
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,240
So this is cool.

1421
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:05,040
Once again, you know, convincing me that maybe I don't need

1422
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:08,480
a PlayStation because the games will eventually come to PC,

1423
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,760
and that may be the case.

1424
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:18,400
So as part of, I think, an interview with the Kazunori Yamauchi

1425
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,400
about the whole 25th anniversary of Gran Turismo,

1426
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,240
I believe it was asked that,

1427
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:28,640
hey, do you see Gran Turismo ever being brought to PC?

1428
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,200
Because, you know, some of the other Sony franchises,

1429
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,520
like God of War and Spider-Man, Uncharted, whatnot,

1430
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,440
have it come to PC.

1431
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:39,680
And he actually said, yeah, I do think so.

1432
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:44,880
But there's, you know, right now, he says that Gran Turismo

1433
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,920
is finally, to title is where we get into marketing speak.

1434
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:52,960
There are not many platforms that can run in 4K 60 natively.

1435
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,080
PC can, I'm sorry.

1436
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:58,240
So one way we may make that possible is to narrow down

1437
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:58,960
the platform.

1438
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:02,080
It's not a very easy subject, but of course, we are looking

1439
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,280
into it and considering it.

1440
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:06,720
Dude, a PC can handle that.

1441
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:07,440
Come on.

1442
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:11,840
I mean, a PC could easily do that, but whatever.

1443
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,120
I mean, obviously they probably don't have plans right now,

1444
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,360
but it is certainly something that they'd be open to,

1445
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:17,840
I'm sure.

1446
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,400
So we'll see what the wait.

1447
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,600
I'd like to play it on PC.

1448
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:25,680
Again, my console gaming has gone way down since I got this

1449
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:26,320
new PC.

1450
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,880
I don't even touch everything I would play on Series X.

1451
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,800
I pretty much play on the desktop.

1452
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,560
And honestly, PlayStation five again.

1453
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,240
It's really just about the exclusives.

1454
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:38,160
I'm kind of bummed from SC 16 won't come out PC day one,

1455
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,920
but it is, of course, of course not going to is what it is

1456
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:42,480
at this point.

1457
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,680
I'll get a PlayStation five.

1458
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,560
Sony's got to pay those or pay for those exclusives, you

1459
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:46,880
know?

1460
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,880
So I mean, it's only fair that they do it, but no one else.

1461
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,840
Sometime in the next few weeks, it's a holiday project I

1462
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:54,080
have.

1463
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,560
I'm going to be rearranging the space that I do the show

1464
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,760
from my office because I'm actually going to put a tea.

1465
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,040
I'm going to move things around.

1466
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,320
So I actually have, I don't know how much I can show, but

1467
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,560
I actually have off to the side where you see the burger

1468
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,120
time cabinet.

1469
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,040
There's actually a closet over there.

1470
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,960
That's like a walk-in closet.

1471
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:14,640
I'm actually going to repurpose that walk-in closet as like

1472
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,000
a mini arcade.

1473
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,120
So I'm going to move the burger time machine.

1474
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:19,360
Great.

1475
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,280
Now I'm not going to be able to get my camera backwards.

1476
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,000
I'm going to move the burger time machine into that closet

1477
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:28,400
and move some things around so I can get a TV here in the

1478
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:28,880
studio.

1479
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,640
And I'm going to rotate everything to make it happen.

1480
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,760
So in the new shot for the show, you should hopefully see

1481
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:41,840
the burger or the burger time machine and maybe future

1482
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,120
expansion machines.

1483
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:43,600
We'll see.

1484
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:47,200
We'll see behind me on the stream in the closet.

1485
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,320
That's the goal anyway.

1486
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,880
I'm not going to be able to get this camera.

1487
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:51,760
Remind me everyone.

1488
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:56,080
I'm not allowed to touch the camera during the show.

1489
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:58,720
All right.

1490
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:00,080
Sorry.

1491
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,200
This is terrible radio.

1492
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:01,920
Help me, Loki.

1493
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:03,360
All right.

1494
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,320
I think we're good.

1495
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:04,800
All right.

1496
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:05,040
Good.

1497
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:05,600
Just in time.

1498
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:07,760
Looking in chat.

1499
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:08,160
Yeah.

1500
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,760
Rollercoaster ride on Rob's cam.

1501
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:10,000
Yeah.

1502
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:10,400
Sorry.

1503
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,360
Sorry to do that live, but I wanted to show that and I want

1504
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,360
to get TV in here so I can do console gaming and that'll

1505
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:18,320
make it also easy to stream more console games from in here.

1506
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,560
If I want to do that.

1507
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,240
So which I probably do.

1508
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:23,520
All right.

1509
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:24,240
Moving on.

1510
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:26,640
Let's talk about a console classic.

1511
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,400
The Xbox 360.

1512
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,360
Yes, that's a classic.

1513
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:34,080
Now, actually, what's also classic about this.

1514
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:37,760
And I want to thank Matt and our discord over at vognetwork.com

1515
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:38,480
slash discord.

1516
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,120
That's vognetwork.com slash discord for bringing the story

1517
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:41,920
to our attention.

1518
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:44,560
And that is that the company that brought back the Duke

1519
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:50,240
controller that was the large concussion enabling Xbox

1520
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:53,520
controller that was on the original Xbox, the company that

1521
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,880
brought this back is going to now bring back the Xbox 360

1522
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:57,600
controller.

1523
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:01,920
Hyperkin is the company and Xenon is the Xbox 360 controller

1524
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:06,080
replica for the Xbox and PC.

1525
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,280
It is an officially licensed replica of the controller,

1526
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:09,760
believe it or not.

1527
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,120
So that's what makes this notable.

1528
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,000
What'd you say, Loki?

1529
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,000
I said it's not different.

1530
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,880
Like the Xbox 360 controller has been the controller for

1531
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:17,280
the last.

1532
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:17,600
I know.

1533
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,680
That's kind of where I was ending up with.

1534
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:24,240
This is that honestly, y'all honestly, just get no disrespect

1535
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:24,880
to Hyperkin.

1536
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,320
I'm sure they're doing fine work.

1537
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:29,040
Just get a fucking Xbox Series X controller and use it on

1538
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:29,600
your PC.

1539
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,640
Like, it's great.

1540
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,320
I do it all of the time.

1541
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:35,200
Yeah, I literally have my controller right here.

1542
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,120
And you'll notice it's plugged in because you can do that

1543
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,840
through a standard USB port.

1544
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,680
And I play dead by daylight with my controller and other

1545
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,120
things to vampire survivors.

1546
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:50,000
I play on the controller, so it's very, very easy to do.

1547
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,280
Yeah, I kind of feel this.

1548
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,480
You'll see the point.

1549
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,200
Where's the Duke?

1550
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,160
I understand because that's a completely different design

1551
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:56,800
for the controller.

1552
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:01,760
But like, this has been the standard for years now.

1553
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:02,400
Yeah.

1554
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,200
Now, just keep in mind the controller is being made with

1555
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,120
the Series X and S in mind.

1556
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,920
So the start and the back buttons, they were replaced some

1557
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,080
time ago with menu and view.

1558
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,640
So those are now mapped that way.

1559
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,960
And then there is still a share button in the middle of

1560
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:17,920
the controller.

1561
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,040
I don't think it was that on the original 360.

1562
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:25,200
I think it was something else because the X button was still

1563
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:25,840
a button.

1564
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,280
But yeah, I think the share button is new.

1565
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,040
So they just kind of added that there in the middle of the

1566
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,400
controller, but doesn't really get in the way.

1567
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,120
So there you go.

1568
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,320
That is something available.

1569
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:38,000
But again, get a Series X controller to be honest.

1570
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,800
Zen Monkey says, what Xbox controller works with the PC?

1571
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:41,280
All of them.

1572
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,480
If you still have a working 360 controller, you can plug

1573
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:44,880
that in.

1574
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:49,600
Not all games may use it natively, but most will.

1575
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:54,640
And then especially Xbox One and Series X, you can use any

1576
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:54,960
of them.

1577
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,600
So yeah, I just like 360.

1578
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,520
You have to be careful because if you want to use a wireless

1579
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,680
one, you have to have a dongle for that.

1580
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,280
That's the only thing because those weren't Bluetooth back

1581
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:07,680
in the day.

1582
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,920
Wired, it should work just fine.

1583
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:15,200
But anything like Xbox One and newer, it's all compatible.

1584
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,000
It's all the same.

1585
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:16,500
Yeah.

1586
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,680
So and then I noticed in chat, they're talking about the D

1587
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:20,480
pad on the three.

1588
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:26,880
I didn't love the D pad on the 360, but I think the one on

1589
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,560
the Series X is way better.

1590
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,400
But I guess your mileage may vary.

1591
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,640
You're welcome to your opinion on whatever one you prefer.

1592
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,720
And that might be the reason why somebody wants to kind of

1593
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:37,360
go back to that classic 360 feel.

1594
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,640
So there you go.

1595
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,000
All right.

1596
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,320
Let's get to our next segment.

1597
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,640
We're going to do the classic game of the week.

1598
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:45,920
I'm going to play the bump here.

1599
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:50,000
And as promised, Loki is picking this week because Dark

1600
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,840
Soccer is still not here and I picked last week.

1601
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,880
So it's only fair that Loki gets to do this week's game.

1602
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,200
But first, let's do the lovely introduction.

1603
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:10,720
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where

1604
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:14,320
I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell

1605
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,200
you about it.

1606
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:18,400
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1607
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,320
And tonight's pick is so good.

1608
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,000
Loki, what did you pick?

1609
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,120
So I picked Sneak King.

1610
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:29,840
This is a game for the Xbox 360 and actually the original

1611
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:33,520
Xbox, because both consoles would play the same disc.

1612
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,320
It was great.

1613
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:35,040
It was an average.

1614
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,880
A lot of people didn't know that because the box looked

1615
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,160
like 360, right?

1616
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,680
Yeah, because it was.

1617
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:40,480
It was.

1618
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:44,080
Yeah, it's it actually says on the box that you can do that.

1619
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,280
And it was kind of neat.

1620
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,440
And I think it did try it and it actually works, too.

1621
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,000
It's pretty cool.

1622
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:54,000
But it is it was an advert game that was one of three that

1623
01:21:54,800 --> 01:22:02,080
they released during 2006, and it was developed by Blitz

1624
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:02,880
Games.

1625
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,600
And this was a promotion that actually, funny enough,

1626
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,800
happened right around the same time in 2006 between November

1627
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,720
19th and the 24th.

1628
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:14,800
Blitz Game, also Blitz Game Studios, I should say.

1629
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:19,040
They're also known for some other games, including the Fairly

1630
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:22,960
Odd Parents, SpongeBob SquarePants, but also Close to

1631
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:26,000
To Our Hearts, the Karaoke Revolution games.

1632
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:27,360
Oh, wow.

1633
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,360
I did not realize they did those games.

1634
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,000
How funny.

1635
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,600
They they did those games.

1636
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:32,160
That's right.

1637
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:38,880
So the game has you playing the king, the mascot of Burger

1638
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:42,960
King, and you're tasked with sneaking around creepily and

1639
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,680
delivering four different types of Burger King meals to

1640
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:46,560
hungry people.

1641
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:50,800
And it had different levels like the sawmill, the cul de

1642
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:55,680
sac, construction zone, downtown, different unique

1643
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:58,960
characters and challenges that were in there.

1644
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:03,840
There's also a two game modes, free play and challenge.

1645
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:08,880
Free play had you actually undertaking different challenges

1646
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:12,880
and then I guess you could and you could also explore the

1647
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,360
area without noise or site detection.

1648
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,240
So it was kind of a little bit easier to play that.

1649
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,240
And then, of course, challenge mode was like the full game

1650
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:23,520
there. It was great.

1651
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,480
I love this game.

1652
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,920
So I bought all three.

1653
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,040
I don't know where they are.

1654
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:33,840
The only one I think I saw, I had like Pocket Bike Racing

1655
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,200
was one of the ones that they did.

1656
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,880
And also Big Bumpin was a big bump.

1657
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:40,800
And I remember that one because the Pocket Bike racing had

1658
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,880
some conventionally attractive lady on the front cover.

1659
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,800
And like the Burger King characters were all relegated to

1660
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:47,360
the back.

1661
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:47,920
Like, what was that?

1662
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,720
I was like a really not great target.

1663
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,200
I don't remember, you know, stereo audience.

1664
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:58,480
I think it was actually like a person on there.

1665
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,040
Oh, was it?

1666
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,880
I just was looking at the footage of Sneak King.

1667
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,520
I love the way the King walks in this game.

1668
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,360
This was actually in my top 10 for 2006 games.

1669
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,480
I remember we did a thing on the show and I remember my

1670
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,280
big controversial pick was this game in my number 10 slot

1671
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:19,280
because it is absolutely one of the best adver games ever.

1672
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,040
It was four dollars.

1673
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,160
It was four dollars.

1674
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,120
Like, name a game that has that good a value.

1675
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,800
Okay, Vampire Survivors, name another.

1676
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,560
It was still worth it.

1677
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,000
It was still worth it.

1678
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,840
You know, I honestly and they had talked about it.

1679
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:37,680
I think doing like another line of these games as well for

1680
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,360
like the Xbox one or something like that.

1681
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,120
I really wish they would.

1682
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:42,480
I wish they were free.

1683
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,080
I would buy them up instantly.

1684
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,160
They were just ridiculous.

1685
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,760
And I was trying to explain to my kids.

1686
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:48,640
It was yesterday.

1687
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:51,520
Like we went to Burger King, actually, or Friday.

1688
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,920
I think we went to Burger King and like did all that.

1689
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,160
And I was trying to explain to them that they made games

1690
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:57,600
based off of this stuff.

1691
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:57,840
Wow.

1692
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,240
But again, trying to explain to them what Sneak King was.

1693
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,960
And it's it's just funny.

1694
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:05,040
But yeah, and I'm sure your kids are like,

1695
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:09,040
Dan, this is not as funny as you think it is.

1696
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,600
Oh, it's absolutely just as funny.

1697
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,960
But yeah, like the little flourishes you can do

1698
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:15,920
and stuff in the game.

1699
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:16,880
It was fantastic.

1700
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:21,520
But yeah, unfortunately, they never did, you know,

1701
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,760
end up doing sequels for this.

1702
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,480
But I think it was certainly well received.

1703
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:29,920
I don't know what the sales were on this, but I got to admit,

1704
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,200
like, I think, oh, here we go.

1705
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:31,700
Here we go.

1706
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:39,120
So apparently the this is yeah, the games were oh, was $4.

1707
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,920
So $3.99 and came with the Burger King meals.

1708
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:47,280
And then they said in they sold 2.7 million copies

1709
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:48,400
during the promotion.

1710
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:51,600
And it was also reported that they said 3.2 million copies

1711
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,960
were sold, although there is like different numbers.

1712
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:58,320
So somewhere around 3 million copies of these games are sold.

1713
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,080
That's crazy.

1714
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:00,720
That's incredible.

1715
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,160
GameSpot gave it a 5.8 out of 10.

1716
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:05,760
IGN.

1717
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,960
I don't know what they gave the game for that,

1718
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:10,320
but yeah, it's funny.

1719
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,080
Who cares what they thought?

1720
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:15,200
They didn't even have to go to Burger King.

1721
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,480
They were probably sent the games.

1722
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:19,520
They didn't have to, you know, eat a mediocre burger

1723
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:22,800
and questionable french fries to, you know, get this product.

1724
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:23,520
So who cares?

1725
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:27,120
Adam Sessler gave it a one out of five.

1726
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:27,600
Who cares?

1727
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:31,360
I don't care because this game is a number one out of five.

1728
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:31,920
In my heart.

1729
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:32,420
That's right.

1730
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,000
And that is why it is the classic game of the week.

1731
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:36,960
Well said.

1732
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:38,880
Classic game of the week.

1733
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:41,840
Sneak King, the Xbox 360.

1734
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,240
Again, another one of those titles where I remember talking

1735
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,920
about this game when it was new.

1736
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:50,800
And here we are 16 years later revisiting it back.

1737
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:51,680
It's a classic game.

1738
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:53,200
Burger King.

1739
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,200
We need you to remaster these games.

1740
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:55,600
Come on.

1741
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:58,000
We got to bring it to modern consoles again.

1742
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:00,240
Just sneaking.

1743
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:01,600
We don't have to worry about the other ones,

1744
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,320
but like just sneaking, maybe a sneak king too.

1745
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:07,840
And then, like, a couple other, you know, we do a sports game.

1746
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:08,560
Bigger bumping.

1747
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:10,080
Bigger bumping.

1748
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:13,760
All right.

1749
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:16,080
Let's check out some rapid fire news.

1750
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,080
Some other quick headlines in our industry.

1751
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,720
We'll get to release dates, a few more stories, and then

1752
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:21,600
maybe some calls.

1753
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,360
We'll see if anyone wants to call in tonight.

1754
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:25,200
Let's move on, though.

1755
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,720
We do have some rapid fire news to get to.

1756
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,080
Just a few quick headlines for you.

1757
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:32,320
So I'm not a player of this game, but I've definitely seen

1758
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,480
a lot of people play Disney Dreamlight Valley.

1759
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:38,240
And apparently on December 6, you are going to be able to

1760
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,480
play in the Toy Story realm.

1761
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,000
So it's pretty cool.

1762
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,960
They're going to have Buzz and Woody in there.

1763
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:47,920
And I think they even have the bedroom as well, or at least

1764
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,160
some cosmetics that are from all that.

1765
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:52,560
So that's pretty cool to see that come into the game.

1766
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,320
So check that out very soon.

1767
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,360
And then this is kind of neat.

1768
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:01,760
The Tetris, the Grandmaster is finally coming to consoles.

1769
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:06,320
Thanks to that wonderful Arcade Archives series.

1770
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:10,640
So you'll be able to play that pretty soon with all the

1771
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:13,040
wonderful features that you would expect from the game.

1772
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:18,560
Almost 1000 levels and introducing the 20G mechanic.

1773
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,720
So, yeah, that'll be coming out very soon.

1774
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:23,840
Excellent.

1775
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,880
One quick headline I have for you in rapid fire news is

1776
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,920
about No Man's Sky.

1777
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,120
You know, I love this game a lot.

1778
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,000
I talk about it a lot.

1779
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:34,000
Patch 4.06 was released this week, and it included the

1780
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,240
Nintendo Switch, which is great because there's been some

1781
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:38,160
complaints about some performance things on the Switch.

1782
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:39,200
What a shock, right?

1783
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:41,680
But apparently, actually, the performance stuff aside,

1784
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:44,160
apparently the game does run very well on the Switch, like

1785
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:46,240
way better than people anticipated it to.

1786
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:49,680
I haven't played it firsthand, so I can't say, but most people

1787
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:51,840
I know that are playing on the Switch are pleased with it.

1788
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:56,560
So, yeah, that's why we're saying they can get No Man's

1789
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,880
Sky to run on the Switch and look pretty good.

1790
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,760
Yeah, I know.

1791
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:00,320
I know.

1792
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:01,600
All right.

1793
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,760
Enough said.

1794
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:06,560
But yeah, so I'm not going to read every bullet in this

1795
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,200
because a lot of it is just bug fixes, especially when it

1796
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,200
caused, like, broken loops and things like that.

1797
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:14,560
And, you know, menus that didn't go to where they were

1798
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,960
supposed to go under certain conditions and things like

1799
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,040
that. So it's mostly a bug fix.

1800
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:22,000
But what I will mention with the No Man's Sky update is that

1801
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,520
they are repeating something they did last year, and that

1802
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,680
is the Expedition Encore.

1803
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:32,800
So if you missed Expeditions 5, 6, 7, or 8, you can play

1804
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:35,600
those again right now, at least the first one.

1805
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:40,000
So Expedition 5 is live right now, and you can run that,

1806
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,320
I believe, through December 11th.

1807
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,480
Don't quote me on that date because I neglected to bring

1808
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:47,600
up the calendar right in front of me.

1809
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,320
But they're going to be running each of them for about

1810
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:50,880
two weeks.

1811
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:53,600
Me personally, I still need to finish 7 and 8.

1812
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,000
So I will be participating in this as well because I did

1813
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:56,960
not finish 7 or 8.

1814
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:58,640
I finished all the others, but not those two.

1815
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,120
So I'm going to go back and do this.

1816
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:04,800
This is also great for those of you that just started on

1817
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,080
the Nintendo Switch.

1818
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:09,360
Like, I believe Mich, if she's out there, she started on

1819
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:10,720
the Nintendo Switch.

1820
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:14,000
So the Nintendo Switch fan base never got a chance at these.

1821
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,400
So this is a good chance for y'all to catch up.

1822
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:19,440
So that's pretty nice as well that is available.

1823
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,160
So check that out.

1824
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,440
Quest Buster says I should try to get the Living Freighter.

1825
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:26,240
It's so weird.

1826
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:28,240
The weird thing is, I don't remember ever getting that,

1827
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:29,600
but I beat number 5.

1828
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:37,120
I went to, you know how I know, is I went to the Space Anomaly

1829
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:40,240
and I looked at all the unredeemed rewards and they were

1830
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:41,280
all for 7 or 8.

1831
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,320
But now y'all had me worried.

1832
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:45,920
I feel like I thought I beat 5, but maybe not.

1833
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,920
Quest Buster does point out there's probably a billion

1834
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:49,120
base shortcuts to help.

1835
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:49,760
Absolutely.

1836
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:53,280
But sometimes be careful because sometimes for the encores,

1837
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,880
they mix up the starting point.

1838
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,640
They mix up the starting planet.

1839
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:00,960
They did that last year with 3, the one that was like you

1840
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:04,480
did 90% of the expedition on a singular planet.

1841
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:05,840
It was a very different way to play the game.

1842
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,800
They mixed up the planet for the encores.

1843
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:09,600
So be careful.

1844
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,440
The encores are usually a little different because they

1845
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,280
run in a tighter time frame.

1846
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,560
So they have to change some things.

1847
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,760
I'm very curious how that roguelike expedition, which was

1848
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:18,160
bad.

1849
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:20,160
I'm not going to just because I enjoy the game.

1850
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:21,360
I'm not going to make excuses.

1851
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:22,640
That was a bad expedition.

1852
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:24,480
I'm very curious to see how they're going to adjust that

1853
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:27,200
for the two week window, but we'll see because I have to

1854
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:29,360
beat it if I want to keep my streak up.

1855
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:29,920
So we'll see.

1856
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,480
All right, moving on.

1857
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:35,520
Let's check out some release dates.

1858
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:38,640
If any, I imagine this week is going to be very slow as

1859
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:39,920
will be the trend through the rest of the year.

1860
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:40,400
But let's see.

1861
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:40,800
Let's see.

1862
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,440
How about release dates around the world, starting in the

1863
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,160
US things.

1864
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:49,920
So we've got, let's see, soccer story, which is coming out

Also the Outbound Ghost coming to Nintendo Switch a little

1876
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:31,760
bit later in the week.

1877
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:37,040
River City Girls 2 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,

1878
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:40,080

01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:45,040

The Walking Dead Saints and Sinners Chapter 2 Retribution

1887
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:07,680
on PC and PlayStation 4.

1888
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:11,280
Really long title for the week.

1889
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:12,080
Yu-Gi-Oh!

1890
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,040
Rush Duel!

1891
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,800
Dawn of the Battle Royale!

1892
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:15,840
Let's Go!

1893
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:16,560
Go Rush!

1894
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:19,120

1895
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:24,560
The Kalisto Protocol on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,

1896
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:26,400
Xbox One, Xbox Series.

1897
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:30,000
Early leaks are showing that that game is really buggy too,

1898
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,000
but it is very common for review and pre-release things

1899
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,520
to still have a lot of bugs.

1900
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:38,960
So we do want to be mindful that that game is not in its

1901
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:39,440
final state.

1902
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:43,680
There will be a day one patch as there is for any big game

1903
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:44,320
at this point.

1904
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:45,460
Yeah.

1905
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:50,160
Marvel's Midnight Suns on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.

1906
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:54,720
And then last but not least, Need for Speed Unbound on PC,

1907
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:57,440
PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.

1908
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:57,920
That's it.

1909
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:59,520
All right, going to Japan.

1910
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,000
We have a busy week on the Nintendo Switch.

1911
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,560
Again, the holidays fluctuate a little different in Japan.

1912
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:07,280
So we do have this week on December 1st.

1913
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:08,240
Shinigami!

1914
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:12,480
Shibito Magire comes out on the Switch, as does Windstorm,

1915
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,360
Samurai Maiden, also released in Japan.

1916
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:19,920
River City Girls 1 and 2 in a multi-language edition,

1917
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:21,600
so you can run it in multiple languages.

1918
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,120
Also comes out in Japan.

1919
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:23,840
Yu-Gi-Oh!

1920
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,000
Rush Duel, Dawn of the Battle Royale,

1921
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,400
the same thing that Loki just pointed out,

1922
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:29,920
is obviously coming out in Japan as well.

1923
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,680
Those games are big over there too.

1924
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:34,640
Rune Factory 4 gets a re-release and a price reduction

1925
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:35,140
version.

1926
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:38,320
SIFU gets a release in Japan this week,

1927
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:41,680
also in a multi-language version.

1928
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:43,840
The Capcom Belt Action Collection,

1929
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,520
that's like the fighting game collection,

1930
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:47,920
that comes out in Japan in a price reduction.

1931
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:50,160
So it's already been out there, but it's price reduced.

1932
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,200
This game is only out in English, which is interesting.

1933
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,360
It's called Let's Play Oink Games.

1934
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,760
And you might think, oh, is it a pig game?

1935
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:00,160
No, it's like a brand of like card and board games.

1936
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:02,720
So it actually is kind of like a Clubhouse Games type of thing,

1937
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:05,440
but around one company's games.

1938
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:08,000
Deep Sea Adventure, Startups, Moon Adventure,

1939
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,040
This Face, That Face,

1940
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,560
those are some of the games that are available in that.

1941
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,080
So I thought that was kind of an interesting one,

1942
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:13,920
because I had not heard of that before,

1943
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,680
but maybe some of you in chat have.

1944
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:20,080
Going to the PlayStation 5, we have Samurai Maiden

1945
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,600
is also out on the PlayStation 5,

1946
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,360
River City Girls 1 and 2,

1947
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:25,040
Dakar Desert Rally is out,

1948
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:27,200
as well as Session Skate Sim.

1949
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:31,120
And that's it for the PlayStation 5 this week in Japan.

1950
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:32,560
Since Dark Sakura's not here,

1951
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,400
perhaps Loki will take us to Europe tonight.

1952
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:37,920
Yeah, we have the Doctor Who Duel Bundle

1953
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:40,800
that's on PlayStation, Xbox, and the Switch.

1954
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:44,000
Astro Knight on PlayStation and the Switch.

1955
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:48,000
We have new Joe and Mac Caveman Ninja

1956
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:51,840
on PlayStation and the Switch.

1957
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:56,640
The Kalisto Protocol on PlayStation and Xbox series.

1958
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:01,680
We've got Midnight Suns on PlayStation and Xbox.

1959
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:06,000
Last Days of Lazarus on PlayStation.

1960
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,720
And let's see, Need for Speed Unbound

1961
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:10,400
on PlayStation and Xbox.

1962
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,920
And a few more here.

1963
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:18,960
Cobra Kai 2 Dojo's Rising on PlayStation, Xbox, and the Switch.

1964
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,520
And we've got the Eternal Cylinder on PlayStation,

1965
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:24,320
and then that's it.

1966
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:29,200
All right, let's do a few more headlines.

1967
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,520
We have four more stories before the show is done tonight,

1968
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:35,120
but we are willing to take your calls and your emails.

1969
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:37,520
Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com,

1970
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:40,240
although I don't think I saw any for this week, unfortunately.

1971
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,480
But we always welcome your emails.

1972
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:44,480
Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com.

1973
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:46,080
We'll see if we get any calls tonight as well

1974
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:48,080
over on Discord in our green room.

1975
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:49,840
For now, we have some more stories for you,

1976
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:50,560
starting with Loki.

1977
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:56,320
Yes, so the Sims 4's gallery has been updated

1978
01:36:56,320 --> 01:37:01,120
to enhance its profanity filter.

1979
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:04,000
So there's been some instances they say

1980
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,480
our wholly unacceptable content has been uploaded

1981
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,320
to the Sims 4 gallery.

1982
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:11,040
This is our team has reviewed and made critical updates

1983
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:14,640
to the profanity filter to prevent this

1984
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:16,480
from happening in the future.

1985
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:19,360
We are grateful for the community's vigilance

1986
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:22,160
in helping us identify these inappropriate uploads

1987
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:24,480
so we can maintain a safe, creative environment

1988
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:25,280
for our players.

1989
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:29,920
And so, yeah, get your smut off of there.

1990
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,720
There's other places for that.

1991
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:36,400
That's right, Reddit.

1992
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:37,440
We went over that earlier.

1993
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:41,120
All right, moving on.

1994
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:44,800
You may not have heard of this company, Onoma,

1995
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:49,680
but Onoma was Square Enix Montreal.

1996
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:52,240
But, you know, some studios changed hands and things.

1997
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:55,520
So Onoma has announced that they will be shutting down service

1998
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:57,280
for four of their mobile games,

1999
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:02,240
including Hitman Sniper The Shadows, Deus Ex Go.

2000
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:03,360
Is that like Pokemon Go?

2001
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:05,600
I have no idea.

2002
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,560
No, I think that's like that Hitman Go

2003
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:09,760
or something like that.

2004
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,840
I think, remember the mobile games that they have

2005
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:12,480
that were kind of...

2006
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,920
Well, there's Hitman Sniper is one game,

2007
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:15,280
and then Deus Ex Go is another game.

2008
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:16,800
And I'm just joking.

2009
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:17,600
Is that Pokemon Go?

2010
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:18,400
I don't think it is at all.

2011
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:19,680
I think this is just go because it's mobile.

2012
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:24,560
Arena Battle Champions and Space Invaders Hidden Heroes.

2013
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,800
They are all going to be removed from the app store

2014
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,960
in the Android store on December 1st.

2015
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:31,040
So this is like literally your last chance to grab it.

2016
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:35,440
All the in-game purchases have been stopped on January 4th.

2017
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:37,840
You won't be able to play any of those games anymore.

2018
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:40,080
No refunds, all sales final.

2019
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:43,920
So whereas some companies, Stadia, refunded all the money,

2020
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:48,080
Onoma already spent it, so they will not be refunding it.

2021
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:50,560
And you can see more in an official tweet

2022
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,640
that they published over at Studio Onoma.

2023
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:55,280
Square Enix Montreal, of course,

2024
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:58,000
they were originally founded in 2011.

2025
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,840
They mainly focused on mobile games,

2026
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:02,880
but they did have a pretty dedicated audience

2027
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:06,320
with these strategy games like Hitman, Tomb Raider, Deus Ex.

2028
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,440
But of course, as we know,

2029
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:09,440
Embracer Group picked out the studio,

2030
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:13,360
and they're not saying that these games are unloading

2031
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:14,560
because of this exchange.

2032
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:17,200
You could probably infer that.

2033
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:20,240
But yeah, so Onoma is now the name of the studio,

2034
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:21,680
but it was Square Enix Montreal.

2035
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:23,760
So if you played any of those games,

2036
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:24,560
sorry for your loss.

2037
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:27,920
Uh, let's move on.

2038
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:30,240
And just a couple more stories, Loki.

2039
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:34,960
Yeah, so Rockstar Games is basically tightening up

2040
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:37,440
some of the rules that they have for role-playing servers

2041
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:40,400
within Grand Theft Auto Online.

2042
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,800
And this is not necessarily going to get rid

2043
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:44,160
of role-play servers per se,

2044
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:47,440
but it's more to crack down on NFTs

2045
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,440
and people pushing crypto,

2046
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,400
different loot box sponsorships.

2047
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:53,600
Because of course they are.

2048
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:59,840
Yeah, so apparently it says it doesn't,

2049
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:04,400
right now the rules don't address

2050
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,320
or directly address virtual currencies,

2051
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,880
loot boxes, sponsorships, crypto, and NFTs,

2052
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:12,080
but they're bringing the existing single-player

2053
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:13,840
PC mod rules into play.

2054
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:17,200
So basically trying to,

2055
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:22,880
they made the comment was that they're an extension

2056
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,880
of a rich array of community-created experiences

2057
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:25,920
within Grand Theft Auto.

2058
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:28,800
We hope that those continue to thrive in a safe

2059
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,880
and friendly way for many years to come.

2060
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:34,800
But, you know, obviously they're trying to stop people

2061
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:37,120
from selling stuff within their games.

2062
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:40,960
I would imagine like maybe even out of game content,

2063
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:43,040
you know, selling different things with that.

2064
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:45,920
You know, basically saying that, you know,

2065
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:48,800
licensed music, sponsorship deals,

2066
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,160
loot boxes and stuff like that.

2067
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:53,360
You can't buy loot boxes, only shark cards.

2068
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:59,040
No loot boxes, only the officially sanctioned stuff.

2069
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:03,600
But yeah, so they've updated their policy,

2070
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:04,720
basically saying that, yeah,

2071
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
misuse of Rockstar Games trademarks

2072
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,520
and game intellectual property,

2073
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:15,120
importation or misuse of other IPs is not allowed,

2074
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:20,000
real-world brands, characters, trademarks, and music,

2075
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,960
commercial exploitation, including the sale of loot boxes

2076
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:27,040
for real-world currency or an in-game equivalent,

2077
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:30,160
the sale of virtual currencies, generating revenue

2078
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:33,760
via corporate sponsorships or in-game integrations,

2079
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:37,040
or the use of cryptocurrencies, crypto assets,

2080
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:40,960
making new game stories, missions, or that.

2081
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:43,840
I can't make new game stories and missions and maps.

2082
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:46,320
Well, you probably can't turn around and sell them.

2083
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,400
I imagine it's the big thing they're trying to prevent.

2084
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,160
I think as long as you don't sell it.

2085
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:52,800
Cracking down on bringing Grand Theft Auto IV

2086
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,160
into the five engines, stuff like that.

2087
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:55,780
Yep.

2088
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:59,440
So they're just cracking down on a few more things.

2089
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:01,680
All right.

2090
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:05,200
Well, is that going to get you to play Grand Theft Auto online

2091
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:06,640
if you know it's going to be NFT3?

2092
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:11,200
No, I wasn't playing it when it was NFT3.

2093
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:14,800
So no, that ship is sale.

2094
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,400
It's going to be Grand Theft Auto VI

2095
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,000
is what I'm going to be waiting for.

2096
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:18,640
All right.

2097
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:21,120
And hopefully, hopefully we get that sooner rather than later.

2098
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:23,920
But, you know, let's not hold our breath, shall we?

2099
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:26,080
Maybe at the Game Awards, we'll see.

2100
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:31,680
By the way, unfortunately, this year at VOG Network,

2101
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:33,440
we're not going to be doing a simulcast for that.

2102
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:35,840
Bobby Black Wolf is going to be out of town.

2103
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:38,240
And I actually agreed to host another show that night.

2104
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:39,680
I'm going to guest on another show that night

2105
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:41,600
because the usual host is going to be out.

2106
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:45,280
So unfortunately, no co-stream.

2107
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:48,320
Loki, if you want to co-stream, you can do your Loki stream.

2108
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:51,440
Yeah, unfortunately, nothing official here at VOG,

2109
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:52,400
unless Loki does it.

2110
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:54,640
I have to see what time it is.

2111
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:57,040
4.30 Pacific, I believe is when it starts.

2112
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:59,200
But it's probably one of those 30-minute pre-shows.

2113
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:00,960
Well, I would say of nothing,

2114
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:04,080
but I do feel like they did actually announce

2115
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:05,200
a lot of stuff previously.

2116
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,440
Anyway, that was a lot.

2117
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:08,960
But yeah, it'll be interesting.

2118
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:10,020
All right.

2119
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:13,520
Last and sadly tonight, you know,

2120
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:16,560
the world of pop music lost an icon this week.

2121
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:20,160
Irene Cara, who you might recognize as the name behind

2122
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:24,160
huge, huge 80s songs, including Fame and Flashdance,

2123
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:26,560
passed away this week at the age of 63.

2124
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:28,000
And you might be asking,

2125
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,320
what in the hell does this have to do with video games?

2126
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,000
And my answer is a lot.

2127
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:32,880
Thank you very much.

2128
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:38,000
Because remember, we all met playing Dance Dance Revolution.

2129
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:41,360
And sure enough, Dance Dance Revolution third mix.

2130
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:42,320
There is a cover.

2131
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:44,160
Oh, this came through loud.

2132
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:45,680
Sorry, I didn't mean for it to be this loud.

2133
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:48,960
There's a cover of Flashdance.

2134
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:50,960
It's more of a speed mix,

2135
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:53,280
as was very popular in that sort of era.

2136
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:59,040
But yeah, the speed mix by Magica of Flashdance,

2137
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:00,080
what a feeling,

2138
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:02,720
sort of exposed a whole new generation to this song.

2139
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:05,920
And some people then discovered Irene Cara through that,

2140
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:09,200
who I do believe has a co-writing credit on this song.

2141
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:10,240
So there is that.

2142
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:12,160
Anyway, that's about the most of that song I can play

2143
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:13,440
before I get somebody in trouble.

2144
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:16,640
But yeah, so Irene Cara obviously has a connection

2145
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,840
to Dance Dance Revolution,

2146
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:20,560
specifically third mix through that song.

2147
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:24,720
And if you don't like those songs in the first place,

2148
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:26,320
why are you so hateful?

2149
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:28,240
Like those are just some amazing songs.

2150
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:30,080
You really have to kind of be sad.

2151
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,720
Like we didn't really hear other songs

2152
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:34,000
from her later in her career,

2153
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:37,040
but certainly she left her mark on 80s culture.

2154
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:40,080
Also, you might know Irene Cara from The Electric Company

2155
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:42,240
was where she was originally from.

2156
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:43,920
I mean, you specifically,

2157
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:46,480
maybe your parents know them from The Electric Company,

2158
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:48,400
but she was on that as well.

2159
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:51,920
She was in the movies Erin Loves Angela and Sparkle.

2160
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:53,840
And of course, we all know Fame,

2161
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:56,240
where she starred as Coco Hernandez in that movie.

2162
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:57,680
She had the record.

2163
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:00,160
She also had Out Here on My Own was a ballad.

2164
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:03,280
She was nominated for a Golden Globe and two Grammys.

2165
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:05,920
And yes, Cara co-wrote the lyrics to Flashdance,

2166
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,920
What a Feeling, which was all over.

2167
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:11,360
She'd have some other songs later called Why Me and Breakdance.

2168
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,840
But she'll probably be most well-known

2169
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:17,360
for her affiliation with Fame and all of that good stuff.

2170
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:19,840
So Dejirama S says Morgan Freeman

2171
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,120
got his start on The Electric Company,

2172
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:22,240
if I recall correctly.

2173
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:25,760
Yeah, I think I did see on YouTube a clip of that.

2174
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,720
So Zen Monkey said I had a major crush on her.

2175
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:30,400
Yeah, I know it's sad.

2176
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:33,760
Darted Suya says DDR definitely exposed me

2177
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:35,360
to a lot of new music.

2178
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:37,440
Absolutely, absolutely.

2179
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:39,760
And so Irene Cara was one of those greats.

2180
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:41,680
So rest in peace.

2181
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:45,280
Let's get to the you part of the show

2182
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:46,560
where if you want to give us a call,

2183
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:49,360
you can join our green room over at vognetwork.com

2184
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:50,000
slash Discord.

2185
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,560
Again, that's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

2186
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:56,000
Or you can always send us a message in our chat

2187
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,720
over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.

2188
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,040
If you have something you want us to talk about

2189
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:02,640
before we sign out for the night,

2190
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:04,480
let me check in with Loki.

2191
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:07,200
It's kind of a slower week with the US

2192
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:08,480
not running for the past three days.

2193
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,400
But anything you want to throw out here

2194
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:11,280
for last minute stories?

2195
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,040
There's nothing.

2196
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:13,360
Yeah.

2197
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:14,960
We were scraping at the bottom already.

2198
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:15,440
I know.

2199
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:16,320
We were kind of...

2200
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:18,800
When we're turning Reddit posts into stories,

2201
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:19,920
you know it's a slow week.

2202
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:23,360
And the same is true of the sites you visit every day.

2203
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:25,520
They still got to get clicks in November and December.

2204
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:27,840
They got to make those ad folks happy.

2205
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:30,560
Have you experimented with any...

2206
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:31,280
Let me ask this question

2207
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:32,880
because this is something a lot of people are going through.

2208
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:34,320
And I promise I'm not going to make this

2209
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:36,080
a Twitter hate boner thing.

2210
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:38,800
You all know my issues with Twitter and why I deleted.

2211
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:39,440
I'm curious.

2212
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:43,280
Have you explored any of those alternatives to Twitter

2213
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:44,400
right now that are going around?

2214
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:45,520
What are your thoughts with all the...

2215
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:48,160
I don't want to say Twitter knockoffs

2216
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:50,080
because a lot of these things have existed for years.

2217
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:53,440
They're just coming to light because of what's going on.

2218
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:54,800
But what are your thoughts

2219
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:57,520
on some of the Twitter successors maybe?

2220
01:46:58,240 --> 01:46:58,800
I don't know.

2221
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:02,160
I think I set up an account on Mastodon in Hive

2222
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:04,880
and that's about it as far as I've gone.

2223
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:06,080
You have Hive?

2224
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:07,120
Did I add you on Hive?

2225
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:08,880
I don't know.

2226
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:11,840
I have to find you if I haven't already added you.

2227
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,280
Yeah, I'm with Matt.

2228
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,480
I kind of like Hive.

2229
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:17,760
I don't love the layout on Hive

2230
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:20,080
because it feels more Instagram to me, which is fine.

2231
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:24,240
I like Instagram, but the photos take up so much space.

2232
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:28,560
One nice thing about Twitter before you know who ruined it

2233
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:30,160
was that it was very compact

2234
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:32,800
in the way it showed its information on Twitter.

2235
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,880
And I want Hive to be able to get to that point too

2236
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:37,200
where it can show the information on the screen compactly.

2237
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:39,600
But Hive's biggest issue right now

2238
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:41,600
is that there's no web client for Hive.

2239
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:43,840
And that leads to all sorts of accessibility issues

2240
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:47,680
for people too, which people are calling out about Hive.

2241
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:50,000
But we have to remember it's two people,

2242
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,240
I think three that run Hive.

2243
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:54,640
And it was not intended to be a Twitter replacement.

2244
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:57,120
It just kind of is that right now for some people.

2245
01:47:57,120 --> 01:47:59,360
So y'all got to be patient with Hive

2246
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:01,280
and understand many of the issues.

2247
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:02,320
They're at least acknowledging it.

2248
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:04,240
They're like, yeah, we need to work on accessibility.

2249
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:04,720
Okay, cool.

2250
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:05,600
They're acknowledging it,

2251
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:06,960
but it's not going to be fixed tomorrow.

2252
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:08,320
So we'll see.

2253
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:12,480
I would be very curious watching all of these people flee

2254
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:16,160
if a big backer is going to get in there.

2255
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:21,440
I'm really curious if an Amazon, a Google,

2256
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:24,320
which would be wild, but I don't put them off the table.

2257
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:27,680
Let's come back, baby.

2258
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:31,120
I would be very curious if one of these big tech,

2259
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:32,960
well, an Apple themselves, who knows?

2260
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:35,360
What the fuck was that thing called?

2261
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:36,000
Wave?

2262
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:36,880
No, that was Google.

2263
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:39,440
What was Apple's social media thing that flopped?

2264
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:41,840
It flopped hard.

2265
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:43,360
I don't want to think about that.

2266
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:48,480
Apple, it was built into iTunes at one point and it flopped.

2267
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:52,960
But anyway, my point is any one of these companies

2268
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:56,000
is going to buy Hive when they see how big it's getting.

2269
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,440
And it's going to be very interesting.

2270
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:04,000
But again, I would much rather welcome Apple taking over Hive.

2271
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,760
And I'm completely fanficking this.

2272
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:08,160
So, you know, insert big tech company here

2273
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:10,000
as opposed to what's going on at Twitter right now.

2274
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:14,400
I would completely welcome Amazon for God's sake.

2275
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:17,840
So Tiger Claw says Apple doesn't have a social media server.

2276
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:18,800
They did.

2277
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:19,200
They did.

2278
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:22,240
It was integrated into iTunes

2279
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:25,280
and they tried to get musicians to be on there.

2280
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:27,600
And it was a music based social feed.

2281
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,120
Somebody's going to know what I'm talking about.

2282
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:30,160
And then you all are going to know.

2283
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:34,640
You all are going to go, oh, yeah, that that came in.

2284
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:36,080
It was faster than Google Plus.

2285
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:37,040
What the hell is it called?

2286
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:45,520
Ping.

2287
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:46,560
It was called Ping.

2288
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:47,440
iTunes Ping.

2289
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:51,360
Orangewrite1 in chat.

2290
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:52,320
There it is.

2291
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:53,280
iTunes Ping.

2292
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,040
Yeah, I had to Google it real fast.

2293
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:57,280
And they discontinued it in 2012.

2294
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:00,080
Ping could be a classic game of the week.

2295
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:04,320
That's how long ago Ping went away.

2296
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:11,040
But anyway, Hive is going to be interesting.

2297
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:13,440
The more and more people that flee to it,

2298
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:16,720
the more and more somebody are going to throw those two women.

2299
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:19,520
I believe it was two women that started that company.

2300
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:21,680
They're going to throw those two women a lot of money.

2301
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:23,200
And it's going to be hard to say no to it.

2302
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:24,960
It's going to be like the wordle dude.

2303
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:30,480
The wordle dude is a great road map for what's about to happen to Hive.

2304
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:32,880
The other one is Mastodon.

2305
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:34,320
I like Mastodon.

2306
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:38,720
I'm well aware of Mastodon's moderation issues

2307
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:40,320
and some of the things that have happened over there

2308
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:41,600
that need to be worked on.

2309
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:46,160
It's a little interesting because it's so decentralized.

2310
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:49,920
I also don't think you should be throwing rocks at Mastodon

2311
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:51,760
from your Twitter account.

2312
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:55,360
When you are on a platform that is literally forgiving Nazis.

2313
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:59,520
And again, those of you that are staying on Twitter,

2314
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:00,160
I understand.

2315
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:01,120
I'm not judging that.

2316
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:06,080
I'm judging the people throwing rocks at Mastodon from Twitter.

2317
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:06,800
Big difference.

2318
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:07,600
I hope you see it.

2319
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:13,360
But I think Mastodon, the hardest thing is understanding it

2320
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:14,960
and getting the right client.

2321
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,720
And I finally did get the right client.

2322
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:21,040
For me on iOS, the client I use is called,

2323
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:23,280
I think it's meta text.

2324
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:25,520
So meta text.

2325
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:28,480
And once you get that, it looks a lot like Twitter, to be honest.

2326
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:32,720
But I actually love that you have a 500 character limit on Mastodon

2327
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:34,880
and it flows so much better.

2328
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:38,080
You can turn off retuts or whatever they call it.

2329
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:39,200
I really like Mastodon.

2330
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:41,440
It's just not enough people flocked to it.

2331
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:44,160
My feed feels really empty compared to what I had on Twitter.

2332
01:51:44,160 --> 01:51:45,520
But I knew that was going to happen.

2333
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:46,240
It is what it is.

2334
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:48,880
I also really like co-host.

2335
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:52,000
But co-host has the exact opposite problem of Hive.

2336
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:57,520
Co-host only has a web app and no phone app.

2337
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:00,240
And to really have a successful social media platform,

2338
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:02,480
in my opinion, you need both.

2339
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:04,960
So hopefully co-host gets there.

2340
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:07,280
Co-host has serious live journal vibes.

2341
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:11,760
Serious live journal vibes, but like somehow streamlined.

2342
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:15,120
And I see the people that are like building games completely

2343
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:17,840
in co-host, which I think is really neat, which I think is

2344
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:19,440
what Orange Wright is referencing in chat right there.

2345
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:21,760
Because he's the one I see reblogging a lot of that stuff

2346
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:24,320
where there's like full on games that are built in co-host.

2347
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,360
So I like co-host.

2348
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:27,680
So I'm on Hive at Rob Roberts.

2349
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:31,440
The one nice thing about this is I'm getting to claim my name

2350
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:36,400
everywhere before some silly politician in Europe can do it.

2351
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:41,440
Because there's that guy that's named Rob and there's the DJ

2352
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:43,600
in Australia that's named that, the gun owner.

2353
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:45,440
So I'm getting my name before any of these other people

2354
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:46,560
that want to claim it.

2355
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:48,480
So I'm Rob Roberts on Hive.

2356
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:51,040
Rob Roberts at Mastodon.social.

2357
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:52,560
And then I'm Rob Roberts on co-host.

2358
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:56,800
So I'm all of them.

2359
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:59,040
Fifth Dream says, I'm just gonna go back to MySpace.

2360
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:00,320
IDGAF.

2361
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:02,400
Honestly, I still have a MySpace.

2362
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:03,200
There's space.

2363
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:03,920
There's space.

2364
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:06,800
Hey, Dartusuya was showing that one that there's space.

2365
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:08,960
Hey is literally MySpace without Tom.

2366
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:09,840
That's it.

2367
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:12,480
It's otherwise like literally just a redoing of MySpace.

2368
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:15,920
So, all right.

2369
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:18,800
No other calls seem to be coming in tonight.

2370
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:19,600
So let's yeah.

2371
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:20,720
Pod culture, same for me.

2372
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:22,400
I go on and I snag my name.

2373
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:24,400
That's why I'm like, I don't know which one of these is

2374
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:24,960
going to stick.

2375
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:29,280
Personally, there's a lot about Hive I like.

2376
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:32,000
There's a lot about co-host I like.

2377
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,440
There's a lot about Mastodon I like.

2378
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:35,200
There's things I like in all three of them.

2379
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:36,480
I love the fact that Mastodon is decentralized.

2380
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:37,920
Just have them all merge together.

2381
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:39,840
They can all like become one big company.

2382
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:42,480
Well, the Hive and the co-host problem is that somebody

2383
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:43,120
could buy them.

2384
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:44,400
Nobody can buy Mastodon.

2385
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:48,000
That's that's the most fascinating thing about it to me.

2386
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,560
So because it's decentralized.

2387
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:53,520
And now the fact that you have things like Tumblr says

2388
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:55,280
they're going to integrate with the Fediverse, which would

2389
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:57,680
mean you could get a Tumblr feed on Mastodon.

2390
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:59,680
And then another big one came out this week.

2391
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:01,680
And one of the photo services said they were going to do

2392
01:54:01,680 --> 01:54:02,640
it as well.

2393
01:54:02,640 --> 01:54:04,080
So it could be interesting.

2394
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:07,440
Orange writing chat says that's the thing I didn't understand.

2395
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:08,720
So pick a server.

2396
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:10,560
I'm like, I don't know.

2397
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:11,600
Well, it's like email.

2398
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:12,800
Do you want Gmail?

2399
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:14,080
Do you want Yahoo?

2400
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:15,360
It's all email at the end of the day.

2401
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:19,360
But your server is going to dictate because, you know,

2402
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:20,480
basically who is running it.

2403
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:22,800
You do have to trust your server admin to like make the

2404
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:25,840
right moderation decisions and block the right servers.

2405
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:28,720
That's why Bobby Blackwolf on his show was like, I could

2406
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:31,200
make a VoG network Mastodon server.

2407
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:32,640
I do not want to run one.

2408
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:36,320
And I'm like, honestly, I get it.

2409
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:37,520
Say no more.

2410
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:39,120
Like you shouldn't have to run.

2411
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:41,600
That's a full time job to run a server like that.

2412
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:42,720
It takes a lot of work.

2413
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:44,880
There'd be too many moderation decisions and things like

2414
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:46,800
that. So I get it.

2415
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:47,360
I get it.

2416
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:50,960
So all right, that's going to do it for tonight's Orange

2417
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:51,520
Lounge Radio.

2418
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:53,280
I know it's a little bit shorter of a show, but hey, it's

2419
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:53,760
a holiday.

2420
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:54,320
What can we do?

2421
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:57,040
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts and

2422
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:58,320
wrap it up for tonight.

2423
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:00,240
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,

2424
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:02,240
tell a friend or two help us spread the word because we

2425
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:04,320
are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need

2426
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:06,320
more voices out there to put out there.

2427
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:07,760
So tell a friend or two about the show.

2428
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:11,840
A nice five star review on iTunes, Spotify, wherever it

2429
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:12,880
is you found this show.

2430
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:14,160
Those go an awful long way.

2431
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:15,200
We need more spot.

2432
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:17,680
Even if you don't listen in Spotify, if you have a Spotify

2433
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:19,760
account, please look up Orange Lounge Radio rate is five

2434
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:22,720
stars. Amazon has a big podcasting thing now, too.

2435
01:55:22,720 --> 01:55:23,600
And we're in that as well.

2436
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:25,200
Rate, rate, rate, five stars.

2437
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:26,080
Really appreciate it.

2438
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:30,960
I saw, like, was it, I know there's another podcast I

2439
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:34,240
listened to that's more Minecraft related called the

2440
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:37,440
Wuthering effect, and they do like polls or like ask, have

2441
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:38,320
questions and comments.

2442
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:41,280
Like if there's actually like comment functionality in

2443
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:44,400
Spotify, which I didn't even know was a thing, I'll have

2444
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:45,120
to look into it.

2445
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:46,640
Yeah, I'm all for doing that.

2446
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:50,160
I want to be careful to not because it might be, it might

2447
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:52,560
be a Spotify exclusive show, and I don't want to make this

2448
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:57,760
show exclusive to anyone platform, but I'll look into it.

2449
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:00,320
I would rather they go to vognetwork.com to do the polls,

2450
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:01,040
though, so we'll see.

2451
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:05,760
All right, that's it.

2452
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:08,320
Let's wrap it up and get out of here for the night.

2453
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:09,200
Let's get final thoughts.

2454
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:10,320
Loki, your final thought tonight.

2455
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:13,120
Keep working on Minecraft stuff.

2456
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:15,040
Do that.

2457
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:18,240
And me, I'm going to try to stream more Pokemon.

2458
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:21,040
I'm excited to play more of the game, get some more good

2459
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:24,800
stuff, start trading for version exclusives, breeding the

2460
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:29,840
dittos, getting three dittos deep on sprigatito clones and

2461
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:30,720
so forth.

2462
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:31,920
So that's it.

2463
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,360
Have a great week, everybody.

2464
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:35,360
We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2465
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:36,960
I hope you all have a wonderful night.

2466
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:37,360
Good night.

2467
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:02,720
Not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge

2468
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:06,880
Radio nor VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.
