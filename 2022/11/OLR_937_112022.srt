1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,220
It's cold outside and I have snow on the ground. That means it's the time of year where

2
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,360
best game, best music, best story actually matters. That's right, the Video Game Awards

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,880
has released their nominees and voting is active. You can also vote via a bot on their

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,960
Discord group. That's new. Discord is quickly becoming the next everything social network.

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,600
And not a moment too soon because Twitter decided to sell to a social network. This

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,360
episode is being recorded on a popular music gaming date. Now it's time for your hosts Rob

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,000
Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,120
week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,160
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,400
every gamer has a voice. Sorry, it's my first time hearing that intro tonight. You just listened in

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,560
advance but that one I went into without hearing it and Jason's really funny. Appreciate the work

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,560
he does there. Where was I? Hi, welcome back. It's another week of Orange Lounge Radio. Tonight,

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:05,520
the 20th of November, 2022. 20 November, a beat matching holiday. I'll get into that in a minute.

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,480
And it's episode number 937 of our show. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with y'all every

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,640
single week except last week. We were actually not here last week. So we're back after a week off.

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,080
Not joining us tonight unfortunately, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers. Jamie, as you know, she's been

17
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,480
dealing with her voice issues and while those are getting better, I'm sure you all are well aware

18
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,840
because she's been talking about it on this show that her mom has been going through some medical

19
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,920
issues and I know she did like a marathon on her personal stream. What's great is that she raised,

20
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,600
I believe it was a thousand dollars for her mom's medical care on that stream that she did on the

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,240
15th. So props to that. She actually is taking this week and next to go be with her family. So

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,000
she's actually with her mom and some of her other family members, both biological and chosen out in

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,760
Alabama. So she's not going to be joining us tonight or next week. Perfectly understandable

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,680
why after that scenario, she is spending some time with her family. So we'll talk to her when

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,120
she gets back in a few weeks. But in the meantime, we do have, of course, as he is here with us every

26
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:13,360
week, say hello to Tech Master, Loki. Hello. Hi, Loki. How are you doing? I'm getting over cold.

27
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,440
Oh, same. I've been battling this like thing for like two weeks. It's stinky and it's not COVID.

28
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,760
I tested a million times for that because of course, I'd be the one to get it three times,

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,280
right? But no, it's not COVID. It's like, oh yeah, there's other illnesses too, right?

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,640
Yeah. Basically, my wife had it first and then I caught it later, like a week or two later.

31
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:45,840
So yeah, it's just like a congestion, a cough now. Well, it's a bummer, but I hope you were able to

32
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,400
have a good week off anyway. Yeah, it was fun. Yeah. Did you do anything exciting or work on

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:58,800
Minecraft videos? I've been working on getting a modded server up and running to play modded

34
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,760
Minecraft. And so I finally did that and launched it today and live stream from it today also.

35
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:13,120
Except OBS decided to record two seconds of it and not three hours of it. But there's ways to

36
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:23,520
get around that. It's just being stupid. So I just have to, it's fine. It was more of just because I

37
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,960
haven't streamed on YouTube before. I've streamed only on Twitch. So it was setting that up too.

38
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,760
And so I expected stuff to be not perfect. And that's fine. It wasn't ideal recording

39
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,240
conditions either because my family was behind me, shouting and talking and all that stuff. So

40
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:50,640
it was, you know, typical first stream. Yeah. Yeah. So we do tape live, of course,

41
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,360
every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network at nine o'clock

42
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,320
Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And there's some folks in chat

43
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,680
like Mike deaf says happy 20 November. And this is an interesting comment in here. Pod culture

44
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,200
suggesting since dark soccer isn't here. Pod culture says, bring Shane on to talk Pokemon.

45
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,760
Well, funny. You should mention that. Hi, Shane. Hello. How are you? I'm fine. Now,

46
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,960
Shane doesn't have a webcam tonight cause he's shy. Uh, but we have, uh, I just don't have a

47
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,960
webcam. That's fine. We just, we have an appropriate avatar picked, uh, in your absence

48
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:34,720
tonight. Your, your V tubing will say, yeah, my little character was moving around uncontrollably

49
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,000
for some reason. Um, so yeah, this is a big week because Pokemon released this week and we'll get

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,680
into that in a little bit. Um, it's also 20 November, uh, which is, uh, kind of a big deal

51
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,200
in the, uh, beat matching world. I'll get into that in a little bit as well. Um, also one thing

52
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,920
I wanted to like briefly talk about, unfortunately I did not have the time to sufficiently prepare

53
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,280
this topic and I'll talk about why in a minute. So I'm going to kind of table this a little bit to

54
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,680
next week. But, um, this last week I was in, um, Seattle and I didn't say anything about this

55
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,480
because I didn't know for sure if this was going to happen, but, um, just in time to kind of

56
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:17,360
celebrate the launch of the new Pokemon game. Um, I, uh, was able to actually take a tour of the

57
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,480
offices at the Pokemon company international out in, uh, Bellevue. Uh, I have a friend that happens

58
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,600
to work out there and, uh, you know, I was able to take a pretty cool tour of the office. It's,

59
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,960
it's an office, you know, so, and no, there was, it's not like I was there to see any product or

60
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,880
anything like that. So don't, don't put your minds in that place. It was just to kind of see like,

61
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,000
what a neat, uh, Pokemon themed office building it was. Obviously I thought of you, Shane,

62
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
cause I was like, wow, Shane would like really love to see a lot of this stuff. Um, I took a

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,760
lot of pictures. I will absolutely share those. I apologize. I did not get through being able to

64
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,600
do that for tonight's show. There's just some other stuff that's come up. So we'll talk about

65
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,760
that, uh, next week on the show and I'll share the pictures. Um, I, I, before we get into some

66
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,080
of the gaming news though, I do want to bring a couple other things up because there are,

67
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,480
there are some important things going on in the world and I'm going to be like completely honest,

68
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,840
like I am a little bit tilted tonight, meaning like, you know, when we talk about like our

69
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,960
mental health and stuff, I'm, I'm not totally feeling it tonight. And I'm, I,

70
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,280
I know that might be a weird thing to say at the top of the show when we do these podcasts and,

71
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,120
you know, we get really excited to do them every week and I am, and I'm happy to be here with all

72
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,760
of you. Um, but there's just obviously a lot in the world that's going on that's sitting heavy

73
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,200
on me today. Um, not to be too dramatic about it, cause I've thrown enough of a fit online,

74
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,720
but you all know I'm pissed off about what happened with Twitter. I'm pissed off to the

75
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,040
fact that I left. Uh, and I have, I've privated my account. I'm not using it again. I've taken

76
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,360
the app off my phone. I didn't delete it because I don't want somebody impersonating me in 30 days,

77
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,840
uh, with the whole blue check thing and all that stuff. But obviously, um, I do not agree with the

78
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,360
decision decisions of Elon Musk. I do not agree that somebody that actively used the platform

79
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,000
to commit a crime against the United States, which is what, I mean, I realize people don't like it.

80
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,400
When I get political on this show, you can sugar coat that all you want. You can try to explain

81
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,440
all you want. You can try to excuse it all you want. People died because of tweets that that guy

82
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,360
wrote on January 6th. And the fact that it's a fucking poll that puts him back on the platform

83
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,120
when he knows that bots overrun that platform, which is why he tried to get out of buying it in

84
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,000
the first place. This guy consistently makes these business decisions and then changes his

85
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,840
mind on a whim. He is an absolutely terrible boss. And I, for one, am not going to help put

86
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,080
any money in his pocket. And if you are using Twitter right now, that is what you are doing.

87
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,400
And I'm not, I'm not judging. And I'm not saying like you're canceled or anything like that. Look,

88
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,880
I get it. There's no ethical consumption under capitalism. You have to choose what you have to

89
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,480
choose and all that stuff. But this, this is the line for me. And the reality is there is,

90
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:08,320
there is not a publicly owned company anymore. There is no Twitter stock anymore. There is one

91
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:15,520
owner of Twitter. And my continued use of that platform would be actively encouraging advertisers

92
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,720
and other things to put money into his pocket. And even if it's not money directly, guess what?

93
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,680
It's your information. It's the, it's the tracking of your data. It's the cookies that from

94
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,040
advertising websites and things like that. And I'm done. And yes, I understand that the one that he

95
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,240
unbanned says he's not going to come back. I don't give a fuck. It's the principle of the

96
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,640
whole thing. It's the line that was crossed. It's these continued demonstrated platforms that this

97
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:52,320
guy has no business running this company. It is the fattest of fat cats inhaling the town square.

98
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,320
He said, he says, oh, Twitter should be the town square. Then you, the richest man on the planet

99
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,280
shouldn't fucking own it and make these decisions. And I'm not playing into that hand anymore. I'm

100
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:11,680
done. So those that want to stay around. Cool. Me. Done. Uh, looking in comments and chat. Um,

101
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,640
let's see. Uh, YYR says, you know, the poll results didn't make a damn difference. He was

102
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,000
going to reinstate the orange Cheeto no matter what. Also the accounts of most slime balls

103
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,880
previously banned have been reinstated. Yeah. Agree. It's, it's not a place I want to be a

104
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,040
part of. Period. Uh, hi, dark soccer, dark soccer. So I need some chat after all. Um,

105
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,600
even though she's on, uh, uh, I w I would say vacation. It's not really vacation. She's on a,

106
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,240
uh, important trip this week of other sorts. Uh, he also doesn't hold any patents for any of his

107
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,360
own technology used in Tesla. He's an asshole. That's it. Like, let's just call it what it is.

108
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,480
He's an asshole period. And I don't want to, I don't want to make assholes money done. So anyway,

109
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,400
that's my soapbox on that. Sorry if it pissed you off, but also not sorry. That's my opinion.

110
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,240
I'm sticking to it. Does this impact video games? Absolutely. Think about how gaming culture has

111
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,600
changed for better and for worse because of this website, the access to developers that we have for

112
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,680
better. Like when we did the president cat thing, that was kind of fun years ago, right? Getting

113
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,160
ready, getting, being able to touch out to the developers and for worse, I'm not going to say

114
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:22,720
the name, but it rhymes with gamer hate worse, worse, worse. Anyhow, that's been weighing on my

115
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,720
mind. Then of course, obviously in the real world, we have the news of what happened in

116
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,160
Colorado Springs last night. And you know, this, this hurts my heart. And what happened there is,

117
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:42,000
is awful. It's terrible. And I'm frustrated beyond words because I know exactly what's going

118
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,360
to happen. I know exactly what's going to happen because this happens every single time. There's

119
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,200
one of these mass shootings and now it's a mass shooting that happens within the LGBTQIA plus

120
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,680
community. My people, I know exactly what's going to happen. Everybody on Twitter and such, all of

121
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,360
these politicians who don't give a fuck about LGBT people are going to be out there saying, this is

122
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,480
wrong. And our thoughts and prayers are with the family and this is wrong. And then you know what,

123
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,560
tomorrow, they're going to go back to writing their bills to try to ban drag queen brunches

124
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,280
because they've decided that's the battle they want to pick right now because these cunts out

125
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,520
there on Twitter, and I'm sorry, I use that word, but I'm talking about that one out of Colorado

126
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,240
and she is a cunt. And I have no other word to more accurately describe it because she's going

127
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,880
to be the one that goes out there on Twitter. And then she's going to say, Oh, you should be,

128
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,880
and she said this, you should be having your kids in church, not at a drag queen brunch.

129
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:46,160
Well, how many drag queens have been out there molesting children versus priests, Miss Boebert?

130
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,560
This is just, it's a sham. It's hate. It's a hate campaign. And I'm sick of it.

131
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,720
Look what it does to my tone. I do and say things I would not usually say

132
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,200
on air, but I'm sorry. Like, this is, this is what it is.

133
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,480
So these things are weighing heavy on my mind. And now there's another thing that that's come

134
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,640
to my attention. And there is no easy way to say this news. This is something that affects

135
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:26,960
everyone listening tonight. I got an email earlier today from one of our longtime listeners,

136
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,640
Obi Wan jabroni, who I think is in chat right now. And Obi Wan jabroni, you know, is, you know,

137
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,280
and Obi Wan jabroni, you know, is, is friends with other people that have been listening to

138
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,160
the show and participated with this community. And I'm not going to read the email word for word,

139
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,320
because I'm not sure if I'm allowed to do so. But and it's a, you know, it's private email.

140
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,920
And, but that's beside the point, I'm going to just tell you what it's about. And it's the fact

141
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:59,200
that one of our listeners who is named that I recognize from this chat, quite frequently,

142
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,640
Fat Ninja DM, somebody whose chat comments I know, I've read on this show as frequently

143
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,960
or as recently as like, not even a month ago, or whenever we were last, you know, on the program,

144
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,560
read comments on the show, somebody who has been kind enough to donate and send money and buy gift

145
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,000
subs for people and so forth. I think you probably know where I'm going with this, I received word

146
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,400
that Fat Ninja DM passed away yesterday. And it was sudden. It was not something that could have

147
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:36,960
been foreseen. And I'm not sure what else to say. And I'm sorry, I know that's not easy news to

148
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,880
deliver. But that is also something that's weighing on my mind today. Because, you know,

149
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,600
I talk a lot about how Orange Launch Radio is, you know, all of us that are sitting around at

150
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,360
the table after playing DDR at the arcade and how appropriate we're talking about that here on 20

151
00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:00,160
November, after we're playing DDR at the arcade sitting around that table, and eating mozzarella

152
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,320
sticks and talking about games we love and what we're playing and what we're into. And Fat Ninja

153
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,400
absolutely had a seat at that table, talking about these things with us. So truly, we've lost one of

154
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:19,120
our own this week suddenly. And that hurts. There's no easy way to say it or sugarcoat it. So I'm

155
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,120
sorry, you have to kind of find out about it that way. But if any of you know a better way to deliver

156
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:30,960
news like that, I'm not sure what a better way to say that. So thank you. I see all the kind words

157
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:36,560
in chat. Rest in peace. Rest in power. RIP. Rest in power. Rest in power. You should be missed.

158
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:45,360
May his memory be a blessing. Yeah. I don't know what else to say about that. So I just kind of

159
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,720
wanted to get all that out there up front. I know, and I'm sorry, sorry, Shane. I know I was supposed

160
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,800
to invite you here tonight. We have a fun discussion about Pokemon and we will. Video games

161
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,640
are the things that take our minds off of things when a lot of crappy things are going on in the

162
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:05,600
world. But I also have to kind of be honest that like, if I'm not acting like myself tonight,

163
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,160
probably in some of my strong language that I just used previously, I'm not a little bit.

164
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,640
This is why. I'm just not really feeling it tonight. And I think it's OK to say that

165
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:27,280
out loud sometimes. But we move on and we'll talk about. Let me first open up the floor. I don't

166
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,320
know if either of you want to say anything or talk about anything. Loki, Shane, or I can just move on

167
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:39,280
is fine too. Don't really have anything more to add to it, unfortunately. No, I understand. Yeah,

168
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,400
I don't really have anything to say except for don't forget to add Jason David Frank to that list

169
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,440
this week too. Thank you for bringing that up. No, that is actually absolutely important. You know,

170
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,560
I don't have that same connection to the Power Rangers in my childhood that I think a lot of

171
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,920
other people do, and I'm not minimizing or I'm not saying it. No, absolutely. I completely understand

172
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:07,360
why people are really upset about that as well. That is weighing heavy for a lot of people today.

173
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,280
Because Kevin Conroy too. Oh yeah, that's a big. Oh my gosh. Yeah. A few days ago. Absolutely.

174
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,520
You know, these are icons of our childhood that are, you know, and especially, you know,

175
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,560
I think it's no secret. Jason David Frank apparently was a case of suicide. And that is

176
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:31,600
a tragedy all in its own that he felt that that was the answer. And just a lot of people are

177
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:39,040
really, you know, feeling that tonight and this weekend. And so I guess maybe I'm kind of

178
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,360
expressing a lot of my feelings as well, because I bet a lot of you are having similar feelings this

179
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,720
weekend. I just want you to know, like, we're all going through it. It's okay. And I love these

180
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,080
comments in chat. SSG100Matt talking about Fat Ninja says, we're all family. Many of us have been

181
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,360
here for a while. Many of us have been here shorter. Regardless, we're all invited to the

182
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,360
friends giving table because of our awesome community. Thoughts are with Fat Ninja DM and

183
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,840
their family. Absolutely. Bobby Black Wolf says, I appreciate each and every one of you. And I'm

184
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:16,720
honored to be in the same space as you. Absolutely. Sorry. Mike Def says, don't be afraid to reach out

185
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:32,400
for help. Somebody take over, please. Yeah, it's been a rough, a long week, for sure. But, you

186
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,880
know, at least, at least we have like games and stuff to fall back on right now, especially when

187
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:44,080
things are difficult, you know, personal lives. I mean, certainly, all every, you know, hearing

188
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,040
even just like necessarily not, not friends per se, but even like, you know, the celebrity news

189
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,120
and stuff like that. And some of these people that aren't that old, or even that older than you is

190
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,440
like, geez, think about your own mortality all the time. It's just, you don't know how much time you

191
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,480
have, and you just hopefully spend it the best that you can, or spend the best way you can. So,

192
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,960
I mean, you know, I'm appreciative of all the listeners that we have and stuff. And I think,

193
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:20,640
you know, glad that he was able to spend as much time as he had with us. So, that was pretty nice.

194
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,840
Yeah, I don't know. I don't really have the, know what to say.

195
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,840
Shane, you want to talk about Pokemon? Alright, sorry about that. I'm back. Also,

196
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,280
not sorry. I let you know. So, but thank you for the kind words. They're actually, they're

197
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,640
obviously very meaningful in this moment. And I really, I understand. I'm fine. And I will be

198
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:49,920
fine. Part of me putting that out there into the universe is how I am fine. And that's what it is.

199
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,520
So, yeah, and thank you. Thank you again for the kind words and chat. I appreciate that.

200
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,560
Yes, please. Let's talk about Pokemon. I know it's an extremely awkward transition, but

201
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,960
it is how we take our mind off of things is with video games. And like Shane, I know like Pokemon,

202
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,640
this generation is something that you've been looking forward to for a very long time, right?

203
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,520
Like how, how long has the hype for this series been building?

204
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,960
Since they announced it, which went like a year ago. No, it was this year.

205
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,000
Was it? I guess at the beginning of this year. Yeah, yeah. It was relatively recent, right? So,

206
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,160
the games have arrived. First off, how many copies of Pokemon Violet and Scarlet did you pick up?

207
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,000
I mean, I don't have all my copies yet, but eight.

208
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,680
And remind us why you have to have eight copies of the game.

209
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:47,360
Okay. So, okay. So, I have the digital copies because they're just convenient. And then I

210
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:54,960
helped put a, a mom and pop game store together back in Idaho. And one of the things that they

211
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,200
were going to do for me was send me a copy of the, or give me a copy of the double pack.

212
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:07,120
So they've sent that to me. And then I have the UK version coming because of the double pack,

213
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,120
because it came with a steel book. And then I have the Japanese double pack coming because it came

214
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:23,760
with a special trading card game cards and some silverware. And I need them to play by myself. So

215
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,880
I don't have to play with other people. And I have five switches. So it works.

216
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,960
So which one did you play first?

217
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,280
Violet.

218
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,680
Violet. And how far are you in the game?

219
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,720
I beat it.

220
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,160
Oh, my gosh. Really?

221
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,920
I beat it today. Yeah.

222
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,920
Oh, wow. All right. But yeah.

223
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:47,760
So I beat the three stories and the fourth like culmination story.

224
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,520
Okay. Yeah. That's a good way of keeping it pretty vague. I like that. So, wow. Okay. So,

225
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,200
how, as a long time Pokemon fan, how was it? How are you feeling about the game now that

226
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,200
you've completed it? And I guess, you know, you've seen everything the game has to offer,

227
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,240
I guess. I mean, you don't.

228
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,520
No, I haven't seen everything the game has to offer. There's still like the post games.

229
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,200
I think you have to complete the Pokedex.

230
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,480
Okay. But for the most, you've seen probably more than most people at this point.

231
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:23,040
Yeah. I love it. I think it's fantastic. I would give it like a 10 out of 10 and it would be even

232
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,280
higher if it didn't have so many random bugs and things.

233
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,080
Yeah. I was going to say, having not played it, but having seen all the footage of it,

234
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,120
like, I think you, like, I think Pokemon fans give Nintendo's, well, not even Nintendo, but like

235
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:43,600
the Pokemon company way too many passes. Like, there is no excuse at this point for that game

236
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,080
to be that technically flawed. And I get it. Pokemon is a great game. And like, don't get

237
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,520
me wrong. I wish games like that that I like would be really great and, you know, technically

238
00:21:53,520 --> 00:22:02,000
perfect Saints, bro. But I mean, yeah, at some point you got to go, listen, us continuing to

239
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,400
buy it in this state. It's not helping the situation. Like they're just cutting corners

240
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,840
and it's not because they have lack of skill developing games to the switch.

241
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:19,920
They've made three of them already or more. It's just sheer like ignorance. They're just

242
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,960
shipping it earlier than it needs to be done and they'll finish it later.

243
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,800
That's unacceptable. I don't think I'll finish it. I think, I think this is the product we're

244
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:36,240
going to get. This is it too. Yeah. Yeah. That's even worse. I, I, yeah, I like, yeah. And from my

245
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,320
perspective, obviously, like I, I do think the game itself is very fun. And at the end of the

246
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,120
day, that's what's most important, but like it would be, it would be a disservice to not call

247
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,000
out. Yeah. There's, there's some serious technical problems. Like I'm, I'm really reminded of the

248
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,440
launch of mass effect Andromeda. Like where you have just all those like really silly things that

249
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,080
were happening and all those like screenshots of things that are happening. And yeah, a lot of that

250
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,720
is, and it's not just like the one screenshot that's floating around Twitter. Like I've been

251
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:13,520
streaming the game and we keep seeing these things like these, like the weird things the camera does

252
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,960
when you try to go into buildings that aren't actually buildings and the whole frame rate of

253
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,680
people in the distance, just acting like a flip book. And so on some of this stuff, it's, it's,

254
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:29,680
it's, it's not a good look for the Nintendo switch, quite frankly. Now there's a part of me

255
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:35,200
that wonders, and maybe I'm giving Game Freak a lot of credit here, but there's a part of me

256
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:43,280
that wonders because I wondered this about RCS2, was this maybe designed for a different piece of

257
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,560
hardware than it actually came out on? You know, we knew, we've all heard those rumors about an

258
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:54,000
enhanced Nintendo switch that didn't end up happening. And instead we got the OLED switch

259
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,400
because of component shortages. And I wonder if that more high-end switch wasn't the system that

260
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,720
this game was really targeting, because it sure feels like I'm playing something in low settings

261
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,800
mode. If that's the case, then, then, then somebody, some executive needs to be at fault because

262
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,840
one, then you're pushing a game out that you know, can't run on the hardware,

263
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,840
number one, or number two, you should delete it for whenever this new system's coming out.

264
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,880
Because they have no problem doing that with like, say Breath of the Wild 2 or whatever we're

265
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,040
calling it nowadays. I don't remember the subtitle on it, but. Tears of the Kingdom, I think.

266
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:35,600
Whatever, who cares? It doesn't matter, it's Breath of the Wild 2. It's, it's unacceptable.

267
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,960
It's like, oh, well, we were going to have the system, like, assuming that that's what the

268
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:46,480
problem is, but like, there are other games that have come out that like No Man's Sky or even the

269
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:53,840
port of The Witcher 3 or whatever. Like there's so many very complex games that are developed by

270
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,880
different teams that have no trouble running on the hardware and looking as good as they are.

271
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:06,160
Look at like all the Xenosaga stuff or whatever. It's just, there's no excuses for it. Like,

272
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,640
I'm sorry. And it, because it's Pokemon, people are going to associate Pokemon with Nintendo,

273
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,080
and that's kind of a blemish on their brand. I don't care what they tell them. Oh, well,

274
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,840
it's a different company. I'm sorry. All the Pokemon games are on Nintendo and they're not

275
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,440
in any other consoles. So it's your company. I actually agree with that is that I know a lot

276
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,720
of people are very nuanced about Game Freak or versus Nintendo. It ultimately it's shot

277
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,160
for me because for me, it's honestly, it's a reflection of Nintendo's aging technology.

278
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:39,760
You know, I hate to, I hate, I hate to be one of those people that's like put Mario on PlayStation

279
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:47,520
5. But I'm like, maybe those people had a point. Like, maybe, maybe they had a point all this time.

280
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:54,000
But again, it's interesting. And I go to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network. We have a lot of

281
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,040
comments. DarkSakura says always be critical of what you love. Absolutely. Mike Dev says we can

282
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,200
criticize the game for having these issues. But if the game does, it's best to be fun and or

283
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,760
entertaining game that should also be said yes, both these things can be true. I can sit here and

284
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,920
say Pokemon is a fun game and I'm really enjoying my time playing it. And also say but boy is it a

285
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:20,400
train wreck of of technical issues that's going on there. And Shane, it sounds like it's funny

286
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,400
because somebody was saying Bobby Blackwolf said it's a perfect game. And it would be better than

287
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,640
perfect if it didn't have technical issues. That's that's how I feel. Yeah. So well, can you articulate

288
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,800
that a little more? So like, obviously, you must be reading and seeing all these things about the

289
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:42,560
technical issues. And does it frustrate you kind of hearing that people are making judgment on the

290
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,560
game based on the technical issues alone? Or do you kind of get it or like what what is your

291
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,880
reaction as a as someone who does really love the game with the technical issues debate?

292
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:58,400
Oh, no, it's hard for me to say because on one hand, I, I understand that you should knock points

293
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,920
off for how bad it runs sometimes and all the weird glitches and things. But on the other hand,

294
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:11,040
like, the underlying game is really fun. Like, the performance issues and glitches haven't had

295
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:17,760
any sort of, like negative impact on my game, except I had one crash that set me back like,

296
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:25,840
two hours. Because I, well, I turned off auto save. So it's my own fault for not saving. All right.

297
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:32,800
Um, so I don't know, I think, I think it's a great, great game. And, you know,

298
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:38,640
if the technical issues are something that bother you that much, then maybe it shouldn't be for you,

299
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,800
I guess, or maybe you should knock off points. But I've enjoyed games with crappy technical

300
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:51,200
issues before it's not going to unless it impedes my fun. I'm not going to give it any weight,

301
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,520
really. And it just hasn't.

302
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,720
Questbuster and chat has an interesting point talking about Bayonetta three,

303
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,520
it kind of being a similar situation. You also have some criticism of Bayonetta three on its

304
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,320
technical merits, not bad enough to overwhelm what it does extremely well, but enough to make

305
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,520
some takes wish it were on better hardware. And again, for me, that is really the takeaway is I go,

306
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:18,000
this shows that Nintendo needs to update the switch sooner rather than later. Like there

307
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,440
needs to be a swish refresh switch refresh next year. And I understand, you know, components and

308
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,680
you know, lol hardware and all that stuff. Some of that can still be a bit of a challenge. I think

309
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,160
it is getting a little better calm down though. But you know, but this is Nintendo we're talking

310
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:39,120
about who's always challenged that department. But I feel like Nintendo has got to remedy their

311
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:48,000
hardware. But at this at the same time, money talks, Nintendo is still selling oodles and oodles,

312
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,680
it probably will still be the number one selling console this holiday. So so do any of these

313
00:28:53,680 --> 00:29:00,960
observations and these these taught does any of it matter? Not really. Because people are still

314
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:14,000
gonna buy it. Absolutely. guarantee it. Let's see. Oh, Mike deaf says there's a backup save code

315
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,600
for if the game crashes x B and up on the title screen if you've even if you don't have auto save.

316
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,240
That's interesting.

317
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,720
Oh, I know that. It doesn't matter. Now I beat it.

318
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:28,800
Yeah. Um, let's talk a little bit about so you know, when I was streaming the game,

319
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,760
I had some viewers that were kind of like, so what really are the differences between this

320
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:39,040
and the last generation of Pokemon because, you know, the last generation sword and shield the

321
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:45,760
whole concept of the wild area and the open area was sort of new to Pokemon. But it's it's kind of

322
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,680
hard to articulate that like, well, Pokemon generation nine is like, really open world,

323
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,880
like even more so than our say us really, which our CS was was like monster hunter,

324
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,240
it was section zones that you would go to right wasn't open world.

325
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,680
So but this one is like truly open world save for maybe the big cities you go to are still kind of

326
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:13,200
Yeah, mezzagoza is a loading screen, going into the gyms are a loading screen. And then one

327
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,680
specific place is also a loading screen. Yeah, but for the most part, it's like super open world.

328
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:22,480
But other than that, like what are some of the key differences from the last generation of Pokemon?

329
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:33,040
Um, I really think it's the open world mostly. The what else is different, like the three story

330
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,920
paths, I guess is different. You're not locked to doing just one thing. In fact, I went out of order

331
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,920
on accident, which was pretty fun because it made the game more challenging and people

332
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:49,360
asking for a challenge, you can get to places you definitely shouldn't be with your levels and still

333
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,920
attempt things you probably should be doing like a lot later from the time you're there.

334
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:02,320
What else? Oh, the raid battles are so fun, because they're not turn based in the sense

335
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,360
where everybody picks a move. And then everybody attacks and then the enemy attacks. It's all

336
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:14,480
it's more real time. And you can support your team with like various boosts and health up

337
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,080
moves, even if you brought a Pokemon that kind of sucks to the raid. So that's really fun to

338
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,720
I've been doing a lot of those. Uh, I don't know everything. It battles feel snappier,

339
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,720
even though the performance sucks. So I guess that's a credit to the new generation too.

340
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:41,760
I would say the biggest one for me that you missed is the auto battling is huge. I think

341
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:47,600
that fundamentally changes the flow of the Pokemon game for me because so so you use the

342
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,680
R button to send out your Pokemon, your Pokemon can kind of walk around with you and your Pokemon can

343
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:58,160
pick up items. But if you use the R key, it will also fight Pokemon and do it kind of automatically

344
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:03,600
like a fast battle. And it as long as you're getting your typings correct, and you aren't

345
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,720
trying to throw a weak Pokemon against something that you know, it's weak to, you can really grind

346
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:15,200
some XP. It is slower than the regular battle. Yes. But at the end of the day, it kind of washes

347
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,920
out where like, especially since the Pokemon tend to cluster a little bit like they did in Pokemon

348
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:25,520
Legends, you know, if you got the right Pokemon to send up against one of those clusters, you can

349
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:32,720
basically do the grinding of Pokemon XP with that. And so it means that your battles are really

350
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:40,080
reduced to when you want to catch Pokemon, NPC battles and gym battles. You don't have to do

351
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:49,120
grinding battles at all. Well, no, the XP you get from the let's go battles is I know it's pretty

352
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,720
less but it still washes out where like the time it takes to do it used to because like you can

353
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,600
bang out like 10 of those faster than it would take to do one of those longer battles. If you're

354
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:08,640
where a cluster is. Maybe I would have to test.

355
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:16,560
Go try it because I seriously like you can you can do it. So to me, that's the biggest game changer

356
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,640
for me with this generation is the auto battling and that whole sort of thing. But then yes,

357
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,960
the open world otherwise is more because it's it's items are in the open world TMS are in the

358
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,640
open world. So now you you know, craft with those and you know that crafting systems change. They

359
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,600
change breeding to to be the picnic things a lot. Oh, actually, it's speaking of quality of life,

360
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,600
like that there are no more computer boxes. That is the boxes float with you, like the boxes are

361
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,160
in your bag. That's been since sword and shield. Did they have that sort of shield? I thought you

362
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:52,640
started to go to a computer to do certain things. No, well, no. So they pulled from RCS and you can

363
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,440
change your moves on the fly, which is great. But like if you're trying to pull out a Pokemon or put

364
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,760
one away, that's been in there since sword and shield. I thought you still had to do that at a

365
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:08,000
computer. I don't know why I thought that. But anyway, it does seem like it's interesting to

366
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,760
talk about when there's technical issues, because it does seem like there's a lot of like quality

367
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:18,240
improvements. So yeah, there are and they just came with the price, which was the performance.

368
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,000
Well, I would, you know, if there is a super switch or a switch deluxe next year,

369
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,200
it would be really fascinating to see, like if this game automatically runs better on it.

370
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,920
Like if this game was already I think that would be very telling if this game is already

371
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:40,320
optimized under the hood for some type of super switch or something. So be very interesting.

372
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,680
It is because there's people that are emulating it on the PC and it's running just fine.

373
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:51,520
Oh, I didn't know that. That's a huge tell in my opinion.

374
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,440
Yeah, I think I think I don't know.

375
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,720
Gosh, the fact that an emulator which already slows down hardware because you're emulating it.

376
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,800
It's very telling.

377
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,600
It's not so much any nowadays because it's basically

378
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,320
an Android device. And so I mean, it's not hard to emulate that.

379
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,380
Yeah, I guess.

380
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,540
But yeah.

381
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:22,180
Um, let's see, looking at some other comments in chat. And this is this was the one this was asked

382
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:27,540
way back. But this is definitely the definitive one about where does this gen rank amongst the

383
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:33,380
others for Shane? Well, let me ask that question. Generally, Shane, now that you've beaten this gen,

384
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:38,820
where does it rank amongst the other gens for you? Like what Gen five is still your all time

385
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,980
favorite, right? Where does Yeah, where does this land?

386
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:48,900
Well, I haven't like gone through and ranked it based on everything overall. But I did do my handy

387
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:55,860
starter rank thing as soon as all the like leaks came out. And Gen nine ended up being second in

388
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:03,300
terms of starters for me. So I would say probably as a whole, it's going to be up there. It's going

389
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:09,780
to be pretty high because it's it's really fun. I have a great time with it. And playing in the

390
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:15,380
open world with people is a blast to I forgot to say that I last night. Yeah. And we're just

391
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:21,460
running around doing raids and just whatever we wanted. It was really fun. Does it somehow

392
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:28,820
run worse with more people? That might be telling as to why it runs the way it does. I mean,

393
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,580
that's actually that's because I was like afraid to do multiplayer because I'm like, if it runs

394
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:36,420
like this now like multiplayer is gonna because you could notice it in sword and shield when

395
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,740
you're connected to the internet like some weird it's way different. Okay, that's that's a little

396
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:45,460
bit refreshing to hear actually. So at least it performs on that same level when it's online.

397
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:49,700
Maybe that's something they were trying to fix from last gen. I don't know. So interesting.

398
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:56,180
Another all important question from our chat. As Joe and Hunter Matt asks, Now that we know

399
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,380
about Shane's list of favorite Pokemon, because remember, you did that a year ago,

400
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:04,100
we did your definitive ranking. Do any of the new ones crack the top 10?

401
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:11,380
Oh, yeah, I'm sure they do. Like, I love Quaxley's line. I'm trying I don't know,

402
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:16,180
like what's considered a spoiler now that the game is out besides story like our Pokemon.

403
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,660
I don't think Pokemon themselves are spoilers. You could say, you know,

404
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,940
evolution of first form or whatever. And I think that's fair enough.

405
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:32,580
Um, putting me on the spot for this. I didn't actually prepare anything in terms of like,

406
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:39,620
my thoughts. Oh, low kicks. I love low kicks. It's the little grasshopper that looks like a common

407
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:47,620
writer. He is fantastic. He is an amazing design. Okay. Who's that fire ghost Pokemon that I picked

408
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:52,740
up on stream last night? I forgot the name or a shark shark shark shark board. I don't know what

409
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:57,540
it is. No chart cadet chart cadet. That's it. I like that one. That's a really cool one.

410
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:02,020
Carcadet evolves pretty nicely too. Can't wait to see it.

411
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,300
You have if you've seen any of the pre release stuff.

412
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:12,980
Probably, but I'm not going to remember that type of stuff. So all right. Anything else you want to

413
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:16,260
mention about Pokemon Gen nine before we move on with the show?

414
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:23,460
Um, I will say not that it's a big deal, but it probably happened like this in sword and shield

415
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:29,140
and I don't remember but I had not been getting any good raids in terms of star numbers until

416
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:34,900
after I beat the game. So that was a bummer. But now I'm getting four and five star raids,

417
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:39,780
so I'm happy but they're hard. This is not some like sword and shield walk in the park.

418
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:45,140
Oh, interesting. I've been the raids I've seen so far have been kind of disappointing because

419
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:49,540
they're all Pokemon I pretty much already have. I only saw one that was a new Pokemon for me,

420
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:54,580
but I'm early on like it's not fair me to don't don't don't base any opinion about the game on

421
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,940
that. It's still early on so but I'm like, all right, well, maybe I'll see something later.

422
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,500
So, but I've been streaming pretty much my entire playthrough the game and I think I'm going to

423
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,660
continue that I don't usually stream narrative games because I feel like they're very hard to

424
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:13,220
drop in and out of because of the story. I feel like Pokemon is different. That the story is

425
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:18,420
generally pretty similar. Yes, I and I know chain is probably ready to correct me on that with this

426
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:23,940
game. But let's be real at the end of the day, the bulk of the game is catching them all finishing

427
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,260
your pokey decks. And I think it's a much easier thing to drop in and out of than say Assassin's

428
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:34,180
Creed Odyssey, or Final Fantasy 15 or something where there is a story going on. And it can

429
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,500
sometimes be a little hard to jump into the middle of it, right. So it's made it a little easier to

430
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,500
stream. So I'm going to continue to stream my playthrough. I don't see why not. People have

431
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,820
been showing up and I've been having fun talking with the crowd. So and, you know, and laughing at

432
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:51,860
the technical glitches together, but at the same time, you know, getting really excited when I see

433
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:58,260
new Pokemon, like I love that. I love the route system being completely demolished. And yeah,

434
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,580
I understand that technically there are still section areas and things like that. But I,

435
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:09,460
I love just the concept of the route systems just being gone at this point. And just getting to

436
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:16,260
do I want to go to the gym? Or do I want to see if this dead end has a secret TM or a Pokemon that

437
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:22,020
I don't have yet? Or how do I make that Dunsparce respawn because it's literally the only one I've

438
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:26,980
seen, you know, and things like that. So I don't know, that part's been really fun for me. So

439
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:32,500
I, uh, I did see something on somebody's stream today, which was really cool. So you can eat those

440
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:38,900
sandwiches. That's the cooking mini game this time around. And it's basically used for boosting

441
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:44,420
different aspects of the game. And he's shiny hunting. So he boosts encounter rate. And he was

442
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:51,860
trying to find cyclists are, um, the little motorcycle lizard. And I swear it looked like

443
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:56,500
that scene from Jurassic park where they're like all the dinosaurs come running over the bend and

444
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:03,220
they have to hide under the, like the stump or the tree log. Like that's the kind of like spawn rate

445
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:08,500
that he was getting for like a good five minutes. It was ridiculous looking. Interesting. Are you

446
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:14,020
excited to shiny hunt? Yes and no, because in this game they don't sparkle when they pop up.

447
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:20,420
They don't sparkle until you actually run into them. And, uh, that makes me feel like I'm going

448
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:25,940
to miss one or I've already missed one. Um, because I might not be observant enough and the

449
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:34,180
way things spawn and despawn also is kind of janky. So like on the streamer I was watching,

450
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:39,300
he got thrown into combat. Like one of the cyclists are ran into him and everything in

451
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:45,300
the background still keeps going and a shiny spawned while he was fighting it and it ran away.

452
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,940
Oh no. So he did not get it. And I'm like, I don't want that to be me.

453
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:56,020
Oh, that would be so upsetting. Oh, especially to see that, you know?

454
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:03,940
Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, uh, you know, well keep us posted on your Pokemon adventures.

455
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:08,580
We want to, uh, uh, hear how the post game goes. You know, there's going to be DLC for this at

456
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:12,340
some point. There has to be, oh yeah, there will be, there will be no third version. There'll be

457
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:17,060
a DLC. There's like an area that's kind of sectioned off in the upper right part of the map.

458
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:22,660
That's just like a dotted line. People just expect it to be there and sure. Why not? I'm sure it'll

459
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:26,740
be its own little area, you know, kind of, and that's kind of how it was in, um, sword and

460
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:32,420
shield. The DLC were kind of like new wild areas of their own. So yeah. Yeah. I'm sure it'll be

461
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:36,660
like that. All right. Are you gonna stay with us and talk about the rest of the news this week?

462
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:42,100
Um, maybe for a little bit. Yeah. All right. Sounds good. Just let me know when you got to go.

463
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:46,740
Uh, actually let's quickly talk. Cause I, I kind of skipped by it because of the other things that

464
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:51,940
were on my mind, but, um, you know, it is 20 November today, which is a bit of a, um, you know,

465
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:57,060
beep matching, beep meaning a holiday of sorts. Um, you know, and this is what really the 20th

466
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:01,700
year of doing this show. And it's, it's nice that 20 November kind of falls on a Sunday.

467
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:06,500
Um, you know, when I was, I was talking about this a little bit on, on Mastodon today. Cause

468
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,580
that's, that's the new thing. Although I understand social media split now. Like there's

469
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:14,020
people that went to hive. There's people who went to co-hosts. There's people who went to Mastodon,

470
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:20,580
like nothing's really like stuck yet. Um, for me, I, I still think a lot of the terminology and the

471
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:26,260
concept of Mastodon is a little difficult, but like, once you kind of get it, you start to like,

472
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:31,700
for me anyway, you start to really appreciate that like Mastodon is like built in a way where

473
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:37,060
nobody can ever single-handedly own it. It is truly something that belongs to the internet,

474
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:41,140
um, for better or for worse. It could be interesting if some bad actors get in there.

475
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:45,220
Uh, it'd be interesting to see how they can like respond to that. But I think again,

476
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:49,220
it'll be community-based solutions and that could be very interesting. Anyway, I digress.

477
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:53,300
Um, I was talking, um, a little bit on, on Mastodon today, um,

478
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:59,060
um, about the fact that, you know, it's, it's 20 November and like, you know, looking back on some

479
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:04,980
of those memories of playing DDR and that sort of thing at the arcade can sort of, uh, sort of

480
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:11,460
bring a smile, uh, when there's a lot of other crap going on in the world. Um, Shane, I know you

481
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:17,860
actually worked at Konami for a while during, uh, some of the better years of DDR and you helped

482
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:22,580
create some stuff on the Xbox games and so forth. Do you have a particular, since it is 20 November,

483
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:26,020
do you have a particular fond memory from those times? I know I'm putting you on the spot a

484
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:29,540
little bit, but do you have a, since, since, you know, there's, there's no more NDA's or

485
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:33,620
anything like that. Do you have a particular fond memory of that time to share with our audience?

486
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:38,420
I'm sure I've shared it before, but one of my favorite memories was when,

487
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:46,260
uh, now he came to this, to, uh, work and we took a picture with him outside and in front

488
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:51,540
of the building and I was wearing a Santa hat and he said, uh, he pointed at it and said Christmas

489
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:55,940
and it just was funny. Like, it's just a neat little anecdote.

490
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:02,740
No, I love it. I love it. Uh, let's see, going in chat. Um,

491
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:10,580
uh, the sparkle is Mike, Mike deaf talking about shiny says the sparkle and sound only appears when

492
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:15,060
you actually go into battle with it. Shane will probably understand this, but that's what we call

493
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:21,060
a coopsie. Yeah, I understand that, but what I don't, what is that? It's a streamer reference.

494
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:26,340
Okay. All right. Uh, Mike Deft also says, but money day and Mexican revolution day. I have

495
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:31,140
tomorrow off. Yay. Uh, dark says, if there's one thing I'll miss about Twitter, it's seeing the

496
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:36,740
Japanese community still celebrating today. Yeah. I understand Twitter is still kind of popular in

497
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:43,860
Japan and it probably let a lot of this news probably lands a lot different, uh, when you,

498
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:48,100
you know, you're speaking a different primary language in a different country. It probably,

499
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:52,980
a lot of these other, you know, bought machines that are looking for English words and English

500
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:57,220
things to hate on. It probably doesn't land all the same in Japan. I would imagine. So, um,

501
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:03,060
I'm glad they're still having a good time over there, I guess. Um, but yeah, thank you for the

502
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:08,100
comments over twitch.tv slash bog network. All right. Let's talk about our gaming weeks. I know

503
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:12,500
we've kind of been talking about Pokemon, but I'm sure there's other games we've been playing too.

504
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:16,100
So let's talk about your gaming week and the types of video games that you've been playing

505
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:22,260
this week. Um, Loki, I'll start with you. How was your gaming week? I played games. I actually

506
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:28,500
played things, not just Minecraft. So, um, go simulator three, obviously, which is in my

507
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:33,220
background right now. So I played about eight hours of that, uh, because it's awesome. It's

508
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:37,940
just kind of a nice game to shut your mind off and just play it. Um, it's kind of a collectathon

509
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:43,380
type thing. And it's like a more polished version of the original goat simulator. I

510
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:48,100
definitely looking forward to when it eventually hits steam and there's mod support added because

511
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:56,260
right now it's on Epic game store and you know, there's something there. Um, but yeah, it's also,

512
00:46:56,260 --> 00:47:02,820
um, as I play the game, getting more and more glitched out, which I think is on by design,

513
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:09,460
there's a, um, you get different like cosmetic pieces that you can equip on your goat that

514
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:15,300
do different things. And they kind of had that in the first game. It was more, um, it was less

515
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:20,340
of like an actual cosmetic in the first game and more of like, this is just the rocket goat. This

516
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:27,220
is a go, the double jumps or stuff like that. Um, so now they have one that you can, I guess,

517
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:36,340
make the player heads of like the different, um, people walking around expand and there's no limit

518
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:47,060
to it. And that's funny, but now my NPC spawn of heads that are like enormous that I can't

519
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:52,340
see around sometimes. I don't know why it started spawning them with larger heads outside of the

520
00:47:52,340 --> 00:48:00,900
ones I gave larger heads, but it just keeps doing it. So that's kind of funny. Um, and it's silly.

521
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:07,380
There's a bunch of weird, uh, references in the game. There is a silent Hill PT reference.

522
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:12,980
There's a part that you go into that you do PT basically. Um, which is kind of funny. There is

523
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:19,860
a Wolfenstein 3d reference, which is great. There is a counter-strike, um, reference in there as

524
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:26,020
well. Um, at the beginning of the game, the very, very beginning is a Skyrim reference. I mean,

525
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:30,980
there's a lot of like pop culture and like ridiculous references in there. Um, so it is,

526
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:35,380
it's a lot of fun. I've had a lot of fun with it and I think it's on sale there for like 20 bucks

527
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:41,700
too. Um, I, I picked it up for like 40 or whatever, but. You know, I mean, if you want it on a console

528
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,540
and stuff, black Friday, it's going to be like half price. So it's certainly worth it for that

529
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:51,780
much. Plus it's also co-op and that's fun. I played co-op with my son. Um, and then aside

530
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:59,780
from that, I played step mania. I started playing on my cabinet again. Um, and so that's fun. I

531
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:04,340
don't know how I didn't know. I mean, I knew it had the mode. I just didn't know how to access it

532
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:11,140
on nonstop mode and set mania. And so I was doing that to try to get through some exercise and stuff.

533
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:18,180
And then of course, as step mania does or even DDR, it's like, oh, it's three regular songs

534
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:24,180
and then a really hard song. That's way too challenging even on like just the medium

535
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:30,180
difficulty. And so that's, you know, that was my life there. Um, but I'm having fun with that as

536
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:34,980
well. And it was weird though. Like, yeah, I mentioned it on Twitter a while back that the

537
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:40,580
cabinet like wasn't working one day, like it kept crashing for some reason. I don't know why.

538
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:50,100
I never did figure out why, but it works now. So cool. Let's hope it stays that way. Um,

539
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:56,660
and then of course, Minecraft, I, like I said, I always spun up a, uh, kind of a modded server.

540
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:03,060
So it's using the crate mod, which has lots of gears and different like steampunky things. Um,

541
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:09,780
along with some other mods thrown in there's like bio mods and whatnot that had different biomes in

542
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:17,220
the game. Uh, one of the things I try to model it after final fantasy six. So there's magic tech

543
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:23,460
armor in there because someone made a magic tech armor, a mod because it's fun and giant parrots

544
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:28,340
that you can ride that are kind of like chocobos. So it's in there as well. So this is going to be

545
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:32,580
kind of separate from my normal like YouTube series stuff that I'm doing. It's more of like

546
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:39,380
kind of a more relaxed, taking a break, um, stream series, or I may make YouTube videos out

547
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:43,220
as well, assuming that OBS wants to actually record my video game play. That'd be fun.

548
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:50,340
Um, but yeah, it was fun. I tried that a little bit today. Uh, one of my other fellow channel

549
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:54,500
64 members, people are joining me for a little bit as well. And he was just kind of hanging out

550
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:59,380
and just doing that. So yeah, I'm looking forward to playing that a lot more. A lot of my content

551
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:04,580
creator folks that I watch doing Minecraft are I've started, you know, create series here and

552
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:09,140
there, and it looks like a lot of fun and I'm always jealous. I don't get to play it. So now

553
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:15,540
nice. All right. Uh, Jamie is passing along her gaming week through our chat right now. Uh,

554
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:19,140
dark soccer has in chat saying I played Minecraft on a steam deck.

555
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:23,940
I'll be curious to hear more, uh, impressions on the steam deck, uh, when you get back. Uh,

556
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:27,700
and also that's it. Dark soccer was playing Minecraft. We're gonna have a collab in the

557
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:34,900
future. We'll see, uh, dead by daylight, of course, cold to the lamb and crazy taxi on

558
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:40,260
iPad OS. So awesome. Um, Shane, what about you? I know we've talked a lot about Pokemon

559
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:44,260
and obviously you played plenty of that this weekend, but what else have you been playing

560
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,900
this week? Pokemon didn't come out till Thursday night. So what else?

561
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:54,180
This final fantasy 14 doing raid group stuff. That's literally it.

562
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:59,380
How's the latest content in that game for you? Uh, it's kind of a dry spell already.

563
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:04,900
I'm already done with what I can. And then the rest is just trying to get farther in the raid.

564
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:12,180
And we've been having issues keeping our roster full. So we haven't really made much progress.

565
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:19,460
Yeah. I'm kind of hit a dry, dry spell with 14 myself. So, um, yeah, it's, it is what it is.

566
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:25,220
Uh, there'll be, it's interesting because this time a wow expansion is coming out and they're,

567
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:28,580
they're really trying to move. Oh, wait. Oh, I did try that. Um,

568
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:35,620
cause somebody gifted me the new game. Oh yeah. And it was fun making a dragon.

569
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:41,140
Like that part was pretty neat. And then it played like, wow, that's the rest of that.

570
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:45,860
Well, I heard this weekend, they did like a returning player thing where like,

571
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:50,740
if you ever had an active account, you could play this weekend. But why would they do that

572
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:57,620
this weekend when Pokemon nine came out? Like, why would they do that? I don't know.

573
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:04,020
I would, I honestly, I I'm if, if Pokemon was not a thing this weekend, I would have gone and

574
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:09,860
checked that out. Why not? Um, but, uh, oops, this was not the weekend to do that. So maybe I'll,

575
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:15,380
I'll pay attention and try to do it next time. We'll see. So, um, for my gaming week, obviously

576
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:19,940
I played a lot of Pokemon this weekend. I was out of town for a few days, so I didn't do a lot,

577
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:23,780
a lot of gaming then save for, you know, my trip I talked or my little tour I talked about,

578
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:27,780
which again, I will do, I'll do a better job of explaining that and give you some photos and

579
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:32,340
stuff next week for those that are here live, obviously in the podcast feed, uh, I'll explain

580
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:37,380
it a little better, um, for those watching. But again, uh, you know, obviously a lot happened

581
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,860
today and, and I won't, I won't recover the ground, but that's why I'm not doing that tonight.

582
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:47,460
Um, so, uh, but as far as like other games that I played, I did, interestingly enough,

583
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:54,180
I fired up, uh, on Xbox game pass kind of a game I'd played before, but the 1.0 version came out

584
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:58,980
of vampire survivors with like achievements and stuff. And so I was like, Oh, I want to see kind

585
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,060
of like where this game sort of ended up. And it wasn't drastically different from what I

586
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:08,340
remember before, but it's still very addicting. Um, if you haven't played vampire survivors,

587
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:13,860
it's pretty cheap and it's on game pass. If you're a game pass person, uh, on PC. And I

588
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:18,420
think it's going to be on Xbox very soon. If it's not already, I know that was some big news is that

589
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:24,820
it's coming to the Xbox console at some point. And it is a very addicting little game. Uh, it's,

590
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:28,660
they call it a rogue-like, but I don't know. It played like, I feel like the survivor thing is

591
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:33,620
now its own kind of genre because there are a million knockoffs of this game. But now I feel

592
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:39,700
like some of the knockoff games are starting to gain almost more steam than vampire survivors.

593
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:43,540
There's one, I was watching a friend play on Twitch. I think soul survivors. It is,

594
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:48,740
which is the same concept basically, but like, you know, crisper graphics and kind of like some

595
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:52,660
different things going on there. And now I'm like, Oh, I kind of want to check that game out. That's

596
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:57,620
an early access right now. So, uh, yeah, it was, I was having fun playing some vampire survivors.

597
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:00,900
I've also been playing a little bit of dead by daylight, but I'm going to be honest. I'm,

598
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:06,740
I'm not as like, I kind of feel like that game's really at a low point right now, but just in time,

599
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:11,460
they're releasing a new killer and survivor on Tuesday. So that'll be nice. The game really

600
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:16,580
needs that. But what the game really needs is some of the rebalancing that they were testing.

601
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:19,540
Like, you know, I don't want to get too into the weeds, but they were talking about adding this

602
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:25,460
mechanic called, um, uh, basically unbreakable base kit. So one of the talents unbreakable

603
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:30,260
being base kit for most survivors, uh, for all survivors, but like not exactly the same way

604
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:34,500
that the talent works, but being able to pick yourself up off the ground so that killers can't

605
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:38,740
just like leave you there. Uh, that would be, that's something the game really needs right

606
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:44,740
now. Cause there's just a lot of killers that are just playing desperate and I get that the

607
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:49,700
goal is to win and so forth, but yeah, it would be nice to have some, some more mechanics in the

608
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:53,860
game to even up the tables a little bit, so to speak. So I just think dead by daylight just

609
00:55:53,860 --> 00:56:00,260
needs a little bit of a floof right now. So, uh, I'm hoping to get, see, see that. So, um,

610
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:04,740
um, yeah, dark soccer says Nick was on that. Yeah. I think he's who I was watching for a

611
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:08,740
little bit playing that it looks really, uh, looks really, really cool. So I need to check

612
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:15,220
that game out, but Pokemon happens. So that's kind of at the front of my gaming menu, uh,

613
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:19,380
for the foreseeable future. I I'll probably stick with it till I beat it, which is more than I can

614
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:24,980
say for most Pokemon games, except what, fuck even sword and shield. I didn't beat for a year.

615
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:29,700
Remember that like it first came out and I was like, eh, and then like, I tried it again and I

616
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:33,940
just kind of went in with a different mindset and it clicked for me the second time. And I,

617
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:39,380
I played all the way to the end. So I think this one though, I'll stick with until I beat it,

618
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:44,820
unless there's like a really annoying thing. I can't get past. Do you think, uh, Shane,

619
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:48,260
do you think there's going to be anything in this game where I'm going to get annoyed and want to

620
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:56,500
quit? Uh, only the graphical glitches. I mean, I don't know if that's going to really bother you

621
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:03,380
otherwise, as long as you realize you might not be going to a gym or a Titan or whatever, that

622
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:09,300
is the right level. And you might need to research where to go. Um, then you'll be fine.

623
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:13,380
How do you search where to go? Like, are you just talking about the internet or are you talking

624
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:19,380
about the internet? Okay. I thought maybe in game there was hints. Uh, there are somewhat hints,

625
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:25,060
uh, in the descriptions of each place, like this is like the medium difficulty sort of thing,

626
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:30,100
but then you have to infer, well, how far up is the medium difficulty versus the one that says

627
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:37,540
it's the lowest difficulty and what's in between those. Um, but honestly, if you just will explore

628
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:43,860
a little bit, you will be fine. It's, it's not that bad though. Again, going out of order was

629
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:48,500
rough for me. And, uh, I was surprised how difficult some of those fights got because I

630
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:54,500
went out of order. Okay. Interesting. Yeah. I, I usually tend to like try to out level, you know,

631
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:58,820
like grind the Pokemon and really out level the battles. But one thing I noticed about the badges

632
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:06,180
is that they're not like level 20, 30, 40, 50 anymore. It's 20, 25, 30. I'm assuming 35. So

633
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:10,180
they're in increments of five levels and I'm kind of like, okay, well I could see how, so I just

634
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:17,620
beat the second gym so I can, uh, get up to level 25, I think to a baby, no level 30. Now I don't

635
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:23,220
even know. I have to research this, but the wording they use seems different than normal.

636
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:31,620
It sounds like Pokemon that you catch in the wild, uh, up to that level will obey you. But if you,

637
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:36,740
if they were like Pokemon you already had and they go above that level, I think they'll still obey

638
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:41,140
you regardless. Oh, interesting. Okay. Well that's good. But still it is, it is some kind of like,

639
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:47,540
that's the only thing where I'm like, okay, I feel like I need to do that because I could see how

640
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:53,300
like I end up in a gym and the Pokemon at the gym are level 45 and I can't even train my Pokemon

641
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:59,540
that high. Like that's a telltale sign that I'm at the wrong place. Right. So yeah. Um, we'll see.

642
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:06,020
I'm sure I'll be fine. Uh, okay. Uh, that's it for our gaming weeks. So let us move on. Let's

643
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:10,980
get into some of the gaming news that happened around the industry this week. So Loki, I will

644
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:21,220
start with you. Yep. Um, so we had some news regarding, um, gearbox and some of the acquisitions

645
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:25,940
that they're making. So this was interesting. The first one, of course, that caught my attention was

646
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:33,380
that, uh, volition has moved from deep silver to gearbox. How quickly deep silver purchase volition

647
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:42,100
and is that, nah, we don't want that anymore. Um, so now they're going to be a subsidiary of

648
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:52,020
gearbox. Um, I hope that means better games for sure. Uh, well, how is that going to mean better

649
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:55,860
games? Do you think that means that there'll be given the space and time to do it? Or what do you,

650
00:59:55,860 --> 01:00:01,300
what do you think went wrong that maybe this can correct? They need to replace the team that makes

651
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:06,020
the game. Honestly, they just need to gut volition and just have gearbox put out saints for a game.

652
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:13,060
So, I mean, to be honest, like they're, they're so confident in their inability to do things. Like,

653
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:18,660
it's just, I think, I don't know if there's much to be saved at this point from them. I'm sure

654
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:23,380
that there's developers that are pretty nice. I don't know what they need. Cause that game was

655
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:30,580
delayed a few times and it still ended up like hot garbage. So it's not time it's talent. I think,

656
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:35,780
management usually tends to be the management. Yeah. I mean, uh,

657
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:39,700
I'm sure there's plenty of talented artists, et cetera, that are not the problem for sure.

658
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:45,140
I hope writing, I know gearbox, like, especially with like some of the borderlands games,

659
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:50,740
those have pretty decent stories in them. Although the last, the three wasn't as strong as like two,

660
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:58,500
but it's still miles above what, uh, saints row was. So like, maybe they can share some

661
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:03,620
other writing staff or something would be nice. Uh, technically the borderlands games are well

662
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:11,060
put together versus what we have in, um, saints row. So I think at the very least sharing the

663
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:15,620
resources or sharing development teams or something like that could only help. I mean,

664
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:20,340
it's only, they can only, I can't say they only can go up from here because they could go,

665
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:26,020
they could become worse, but, um, I'm hoping that under a new direction that it will end up working

666
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:33,540
out better for them. So I hope to see something from that. Um, also they have announced that

667
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:41,380
gearbox studio Shanghai is going to be coming. And so it was formerly Eidos Shanghai, but now

668
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:47,620
it's going to represent gearbox entertainment. And, um, so that's pretty cool. I'm not sure

669
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:52,900
exactly what they're going to be working on right now, but, uh, producing more content from,

670
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:58,100
you know, the area they said, uh, China is a hotbed of industry talent and I'm confident

671
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:03,860
that gearbox studio Shanghai will be instrumental in our vision for international growth here at

672
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:12,660
gearbox. So cool. Um, and then, uh, last but not least, they've also acquired the risk of rain

673
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:19,060
of franchise. So that's a pretty awesome roguelike game. And, um, so now they have that under their

674
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:27,780
belt as well with, um, Papu Papu games. It'll be interesting to see what they kind of use all

675
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:32,420
this to make in the coming, in the, in the future, you know, cause I'm sure they'll take some of the

676
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:36,980
talent with the saints row and maybe shuffle it up and put it on some other games. It'll be

677
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:41,940
interesting. Yeah. I mean, kind of seeing like what risk of rain, if I was to combine risk of

678
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:49,540
rain and volition together, it, I mean, that basically gets me, um, oh gosh, I want to say

679
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:54,660
red faction. I don't remember if that was their, their game, their Mars, like game that was kind of

680
01:02:54,660 --> 01:03:02,180
like that. I don't remember if that was the name of it or not, but, um, yeah. I mean, cool. I'm

681
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:07,940
excited. Let's see what they come up with. It's funny you say red faction because that is in

682
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:13,300
chat. Hi, is that good to see you. And is that is reminding me of something else that I played

683
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:16,740
this weekend that I completely forgot to talk about what wasn't this weekend, but like literally

684
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:22,100
like all week. So, um, but it's because I always play these games. So it's, it's like Loki and

685
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:28,500
Minecraft. It's, it's me and Ingress and Pokemon go and all this stuff. So there was a big live

686
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:33,460
event in Ingress in LA and I wasn't able to go because I was in Seattle at the same time,

687
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:39,540
but long story short, what happened after the event is that they introduced a new mechanic

688
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:45,300
into the game that there's a lot of mystery about. And it's this always rumored third faction got

689
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:48,740
introduced into the game. And no, it's not something that players could just switch to.

690
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:52,900
If you don't know the basics of Ingress, which was the game that Niantic made before Pokemon go,

691
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:57,460
which is where a lot of your Poke stops and gyms came from, uh, it's a much more player versus

692
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:01,620
player type of game where you pick either the enlightened or the resistance green team or blue

693
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:05,940
team, basically. And for years and years and years, there's been rumors about a red faction

694
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:10,420
and people that I think, I think they just don't like their own team and they don't like the other

695
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:15,460
team. So I think there's a lot of people that are wanting a third place to go. Um, which guess what

696
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:19,380
that third team would suffer from all the same problems. So, you know, it is what it is, but

697
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:26,900
it's interesting because, uh, once the event in LA was over a portal at Dodger Stadium nearby,

698
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:31,300
which was inaccessible, you couldn't get in there because Dodger Stadium is closed,

699
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:35,940
unless there's something going on, a portal in there went red. And so it made a lot of

700
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:41,140
questions like what's going on. And so now a red faction has shown up into the game. It is

701
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:47,380
basically an NPC faction is what we know at this time. The interesting thing is a few of these

702
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:54,100
portals went live around the time. The inaccessible one at the Dodger Stadium went live. One of the

703
01:04:54,100 --> 01:05:02,020
other portals happened to show up at the Space Needle. And guess where I was at a hotel two

704
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:08,260
blocks away from the Space Needle. So when I heard that this was going on, I actually ended up being

705
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:13,860
one of the first players. I actually recorded video and had to send it. Well, I didn't have to,

706
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:18,180
but I sent it to people that were on my team that were trying to investigate what the hell is going

707
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:23,620
on. Because not only was the Space Needle a red portal, but it was starting to link

708
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:29,620
and create other red portals. And so it was the first time I think the Space Needle was the first

709
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:36,020
portal that actually started linking to other portals. So I was like, and how often in your

710
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:42,580
life are you going to say this? Alan, I got to be right back. I need to go and blow up the Space

711
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:52,500
Needle in a game, in a game, in a game. So I did. I went and I pew pew pew laser beams in my video

712
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:57,380
game, the Space Needle and the surrounding portals and, you know, sent off the video and

713
01:05:57,380 --> 01:06:02,660
all that stuff. And that was, that was kind of neat to do that. Yeah. As that said, he ran to

714
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:06,100
get it in the middle of the night. It was, it was like 10 o'clock at night over there when that

715
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:11,620
happened. So yeah, all we know is that there is a third faction in the game. Makina is the name of

716
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:16,340
it, because now there's a stat that tracks it. There has been teased for a little while. And one

717
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:22,660
of the creative minds with Ingress did an interview with GameSpot, I think it was. This is actually the

718
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:25,700
10th anniversary of Ingress, believe it or not. So the game's been out for 10 years. I mean,

719
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:30,740
Pokemon Go has been out for six. So it's probably not too surprising that Ingress has been out for

720
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:36,900
10 years. And they've actually been talking about that a PvE element is something they're looking

721
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:43,540
to add to the game. And so I think this red faction is the PvE element. How it really is

722
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:47,780
going to work, we still don't know. There's a lot of question marks about it. But there is another

723
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:54,500
live event in Japan in December 10. And that is the culmination of the current series. So it's

724
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:58,900
expected we're going to know a lot more about what's going on once the Japanese event is over

725
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:03,860
on December 10. So anyway, just a quick aside. A little weird. I don't know how they're going

726
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:10,260
to implement that because that's just like, Oh, hey, I'm feeling Oh, and it this NPC thing

727
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:15,140
knocked out. Well, that Well, here's the interesting thing. So far anyway, the NPC is

728
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:21,380
only taking over neutral portals. It isn't attacking other player portals. But because

729
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:28,980
it is linking, it is able to block other links. And the red faction has been observed, they do

730
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:35,220
not observe the rule of being able to throw links over existing links. So this has a lot of fielders

731
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:44,020
very nervous, because the red faction can fuck up. Well, yeah, yeah. But so far, I think, you know,

732
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:50,340
a lot of the massive fielding happened usually happens in really rural areas. And it doesn't

733
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:54,100
seem like the red faction can link very far. Again, there's a lot of details we just don't

734
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:58,420
know. This element in the game is like it's one of those things that Ingress does. It's a mystery.

735
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:03,140
It's up to the player base to figure it out and investigate. And that's why I had to take a video

736
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:07,700
of what it looks like when you attack the portals. And because this was the first time it was learned

737
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:12,660
about how linked behavior would work. And one thing we learned from this is that because there

738
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:17,220
was a red portal that was linked to the space needle that I didn't go kill because it was a few

739
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:21,380
blocks away. And I was like, it's cold, I'm not walking all the way over there. That portal ended

740
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:27,060
up disintegrating on its own. So that was something that that experiment kind of learned is that

741
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:33,700
if the portal doesn't stay linked to the nerve center, it might decay and pass away on its own.

742
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:38,020
So this is it's a weird thing. So anyway, yeah, I don't want to get too into the weeds of Ingress

743
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:43,620
because I know not everyone plays it. But I don't think it's going to mess with the massive fields

744
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:48,500
and the teamwork type of thing. But it is going to be very interesting to see how this takes over

745
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:56,180
rural areas because it's happening right now. Nearby for us, Lodi, you know, the town of Lodi,

746
01:08:56,180 --> 01:09:01,140
right? It's a more rural area. There's really nobody that plays regularly in Lodi. Well, guess

747
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:07,460
what? There is huge red faction activity out in Lodi Lake right now, which is a walking trail down

748
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:14,180
there. And I can't really go down there easily because it gets dark at 430 now and the lake

749
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:19,300
closes at dark and I have to work. So it's like, it's, yeah, it's interesting to see what happens.

750
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:26,500
But the other interesting thing, look at Moscow. Ironically, Ingress is unplayable in Russia right

751
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:31,460
now. Niantic shut the game down in Russia when a lot of other companies shut down their services

752
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:36,180
in Russia because of what's going on in Ukraine. So if you actually look at the map in Moscow right

753
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:44,420
now, it is very, very red, which I know, insert your own, you know, red jokes about Russia. But

754
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:49,060
like the reality is, as far as the game mechanic goes, it's interesting to see what happens when

755
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:55,380
literally nobody can do anything about it. I'm not sure if the developers thought that one through.

756
01:09:56,660 --> 01:10:00,420
But we'll see. We'll see what they will see. We'll see where the story goes. I don't know.

757
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:07,220
Breaking entertainment news. Oh, good or bad. It's not even very video game related.

758
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:15,460
Bob Chapek is out of Disney. He got replaced just tonight with Bob Iger again.

759
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:23,060
Let's celebrate. Let's celebrate good times. Come on. Because you know what?

760
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:28,180
Disneyland is a fucking disaster right now. So as that and that's probably the reason why he

761
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:38,660
got the axe. And to that I say good fucking riddance. Goodbye. I mean, lol at Bob Iger coming back

762
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:46,340
again. But I mean, it can't be any worse. So that is interesting. Entertainment news. Thank you for

763
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:51,940
sharing that. Interesting. Tiger Claw just dropped the link in chat. So yeah, other comments in chat.

764
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:59,220
Let's see. DJ Roma SS. Oh shit. Dark soccer says Oh, Mike Deaf says for the freaking best. Yep.

765
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:04,980
Pretty much. Pretty much. All right. Thank you. Thank you for the late breaking news.

766
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:10,580
You're welcome. That you know, even though Disney doesn't super get involved with video games

767
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:14,500
anymore, they don't have an in house development studio. There has been that talk about how they're

768
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:18,740
willing to license out IPS and for things that aren't just Kingdom Hearts. So it'll be interesting

769
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:26,820
to see how that attitude maybe evolves or doesn't under back under Bob Iger, I guess so. All right.

770
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:35,060
Moving on. This is very interesting what's happened here. Yuji Naka, you know that name,

771
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:42,420
right? He co created legendary franchise Sonic, legendary franchise Balan Wonder World,

772
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:49,620
I was gonna say Sonic and less legendary. Far more legendary. Wait, are you a fan of Balan

773
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:55,860
Wonder World? No, I think it's a terrible game. But it's like, it's infamous and how bad it is.

774
01:11:55,860 --> 01:12:02,020
So I think it's like the show. It's more known than Yeah, it's the what the show girls. It's

775
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:06,660
so bad. Like it has a reputation. I've never seen that still. Really, you should you should change

776
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:11,140
that someday. No, you won't like it. I already know you. You don't appreciate bad movies. Like,

777
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:16,420
is there you say is it's a bad movie, but you enjoy it. There's like a lot of 80s movies that

778
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:23,140
are bad that I enjoy. I feel like, like horror, like I wouldn't say those. I will I wouldn't say

779
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:30,260
like better off dead is a great movie, but I love it. But it's just it's it's 80s cheese.

780
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:35,780
What about a similar sounding but very different movie drop dead Fred? That was an 80s movie that

781
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:43,780
is my cousin's terrible. I never I never watched it. I just know the chick from Gremlins is in it.

782
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:51,780
All right. Oh, dark soccer says that was 90s. It must have been that kind of late 80s early 90s

783
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:57,380
period that tech is technically Paula Abdul. I think forever your girl was 1990 album,

784
01:12:57,380 --> 01:13:01,620
but a lot of people associate her the 80s. So it's that it's that kind of like that in between

785
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:08,500
period. So anyway, maybe an 89 album. Anyway, but back to Yuji Naka, who did co create Sonic,

786
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:13,380
which obviously Sonic had its own huge game recently. I actually was curious to check it out

787
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:18,820
Sonic frontiers. I it's just it released at a bad time because I'm really all about Pokemon now.

788
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:24,340
But I'll be curious, especially if it goes on sale, to pick up Sonic frontiers. I'm curious

789
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:29,460
enough. Oh, I saw it place already had it on sale. I think for like 40 as like, that's not a good

790
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:33,540
sign. But I think it was also just a random sale. So I didn't really read anything. Well,

791
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:36,660
I'll be curious what happens with Black Friday, because you know, some of the gaming sales are

792
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:42,260
already starting for Black Friday. And like Gotham Knights is on the PlayStation Black Friday sale

793
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:47,700
that game just fucking came out. So I'm curious what else that's so recent, we'll start to get

794
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:52,340
discounted already. It'll be interesting. Seriously, don't buy any new games until Friday,

795
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:57,460
if you can stand it don't except for Pokemon. Well, yeah. Well, Nintendo games never go on

796
01:13:57,460 --> 01:14:04,660
sale. So that is the exception. All right. Anyway, and yes, game free games are Nintendo games,

797
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:09,220
as far as I'm concerned. All right. Back to Yuji Naka. What happened to Yuji Naka? Well,

798
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:13,780
you can read it on the sidebar there for those on the podcast feed. Apparently he's been arrested.

799
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:21,060
And this has to go with ongoing Square Enix insider trading investigation. Also arrested

800
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:28,180
from Square Enix employees Taisuke Suzuki and Fumiaki Suzuki. Apparently they acquired stock

801
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:34,420
in the game development company Square Enix, aiming prior to the announcement of the Dragon

802
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:41,940
Quest title on mobile Dragon Quest tacked. So this has to do with maybe potentially allegedly

803
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:47,780
having advanced knowledge of a Dragon Quest mobile game. And you know that if you have

804
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:51,860
insider secrets about what a company is doing, it's illegal to be traded. This is what Martha

805
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:59,620
Stewart went to jail for. Long story short. So this is allegedly what's happening. Allegedly

806
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:07,380
Suzuki and Suzuki purchased 47 million yen that's about $300,000 in the developer aiming who is

807
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:13,220
making the game for Square Enix. Yuji Naka apparently purchased 10,000 shares of aiming

808
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:19,140
stock for about $20,000 before the same announcement. In a statement Square Enix has said,

809
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:23,540
we deeply regret the great concern this has caused to all concerned. We have dealt with

810
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:28,500
this incident strictly including internal disciplinary actions taken against the suspected

811
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:33,300
employees. Well, Yuji Naka left Square Enix a long time ago. So I'm assuming that statement

812
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:40,580
is about the other two. But Yuji Naka ironically also in a lawsuit case with Square Enix right now

813
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:44,420
because he was removed from the game about half a year before the release. And you might remember

814
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:50,180
he's trying to fault all the problems with that game on him getting fired and basically not being

815
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:57,620
able to fix the problems in Square Enix releasing the game anyway. So interesting story. Tiger

816
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:02,900
Kalan Chat says the news about Yuji Naka being arrested was wild news for the Sonic community.

817
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:08,820
Well, yeah. Imagine if Miyamoto got arrested tomorrow. You know, like, Nintendo fans would

818
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:16,020
be like, the fuck? Like that's that's what it is to Sonic in many ways. So it's it's this is a big

819
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:22,260
deal, especially for folks in that fandom. Is it going to change the future of the franchise?

820
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:29,860
Not really. I think Yuji Naka was already pretty disconnected from things. It takes team upon

821
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:36,260
teams upon teams of people to build these games at this point. But it's it's weird. You know,

822
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:44,100
and it sucks to see the people that you idolize allegedly participating in in crappy things. But

823
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:53,300
you know, anyway. All right. Yeah, Dr. Sia says I was WTF when I heard this one. Yeah, for sure.

824
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:58,180
It's it is. It's wild news. Wild news. All right. Moving on. Loki, what do you have for us?

825
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:06,020
Yeah, so remember, we heard rumors for quite a while that they were going to be doing an Xbox

826
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:14,100
Game Pass streaming box. And kind of, you know, I think even people saw it in the back of it. Was

827
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:20,580
it that I remember Phil Spencer? Phil Spencer? Yes. He always hides stuff or allegedly hide stuff

828
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:29,380
in his office. He does it. He's been caught doing it. Anyways, so yeah, they were going to do

829
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:34,820
something like that. But unfortunately, it became too cost prohibitive. They said that their Xbox

830
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:40,180
Keystone was starting to get close in price to the Xbox Series S. And at that point, it's like,

831
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:45,060
why even bother, you know, because you would be cutting into your own sales at that point.

832
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:51,140
They wanted to announce that they, you know, basically said that it had to be something

833
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:57,540
around like 129 or 99 somewhere in that ballpark to make sense. But it was starting to get closer

834
01:17:57,540 --> 01:18:05,700
to, you know, 200, $300. So at that point, it's just like, you know, they can't do it. But

835
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:12,020
it's fine. I guess you buy a Series X or Series S then or something else. I mean,

836
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:15,780
it helps sell the system for sure. And that's what E3VL in chat says. So a

837
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:20,660
downgraded Series S, I mean, in some way, I mean, you still have to have access to the internet in

838
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:25,940
the cloud. So it's not even a device that would work everywhere. But ironically, it's the kind

839
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:30,820
of thing I could see being a really good device, you know, like in Japan, where there is a lot more

840
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:34,740
cloud gaming, you see the streaming games on the switch and things like that. So it could have been

841
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:40,020
very interesting for that. But it's also like something to like when, like the same thing that

842
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:45,140
happened with, you know, the stadia or something like that, where you have this device for the

843
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:49,940
service, and then what happens when that service goes away? And sincerely, you know, you've got

844
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:55,780
doorstop there. So it's almost like, you know, with the S or something like that, it would make

845
01:18:55,780 --> 01:19:01,620
more sense, because the release there, you could, you know, make purchases and stuff like that,

846
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:07,300
I don't know, they could be, it wouldn't really make sense for them to have that unless they

847
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:12,100
could get the price to point where it's like one of those Roku streaming sticks or something like

848
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:16,740
that, you know, we can get the hardware down to that. But it's just not possible.

849
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:22,900
By the way, speaking of cloud based gaming, and I can't wait until she's back to talk to her about

850
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:27,300
this. But remember, we had a we had an in depth conversation with dark soccer when the news about

851
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:33,620
stadia came out, right. So those stadia refunds are going out right now. And dark soccer in chat

852
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:43,060
right now says, I got 3500 I got my stadia refund. Oh, well, right. I knew that's like tax return

853
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:48,980
money. I know that's that. But it's that's, I mean, look, look, no one has any room to judge,

854
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:53,540
we all spend a lot of money on video games. That's, that's not what it's about. But it's like

855
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:59,940
getting that much money back. And the fact that Google actually refunded that much, and like

856
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:07,860
didn't have a cap is actually kind of like, wow. Like dark soccer's last two years of gaming,

857
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:12,020
Google has now paid her has been re she's been reimbursed for like the last two years of her

858
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:18,100
gaming career from Google PlayStation five money right there. Right. That's right. I feel like with

859
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:27,700
3500. Like, you can build your own cloud machine. I mean, yeah, good. That's like eight Nintendo

860
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:32,260
switches. Yeah. Oh, yeah. And you know something about that. Imagine if Nintendo refunded switch

861
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:40,100
money. Ironically, that's how many switches it take the run Pokemon. Yeah, pretty much.

862
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:47,380
Um, and dark dark soccer says I keep all my DLC on DVD. Yeah, that's that literally dark soccer's

863
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:52,020
last two years of gaming has been paid for. And if a lot of us added up what we spent on games

864
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:56,660
over the last two years, keep in mind dark soccer was all in on stadia. So if you're sitting here

865
01:20:56,660 --> 01:21:02,660
going that is a lot of money. Well, why don't you add up you if you buy one game every month,

866
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:09,620
you spent $600 in a month, that's no DLC or it's one game every month, you spending $1200 in two

867
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:15,380
years. So essentially, she got all the DLC for free, though. Yep. Yeah, she nice. Google has

868
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:20,500
comped her gaming for the past two years. See, this is what it feels like to get big. This is

869
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:28,500
this is what it feels like to be one of those big name streamers. For you. You take that 3500 and

870
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:34,500
spend it on lotto tickets. Just kidding. Don't do that would not be good. She would never do that.

871
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:45,060
All right. Anyway, let's move on. And let's talk about Oh, the game awards are on their way. It's

872
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:49,620
that time of year. The game awards are always one of those things. I feel like they don't leave a

873
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:55,700
lot of weeks to hype the game awards. Like the nominees get announced and then like, two three

874
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:59,220
weeks later, the awards happen. And I think that's what it is because the awards are what they're on

875
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:04,260
December 7. So it's only like a three week gap between the announcement of the nominees and the

876
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:11,300
actual ceremony. So you can vote on the official website. You can also vote on discord. That's a

877
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:16,420
really clever way to get them to to get you to get in because they know a lot of people are using

878
01:22:16,420 --> 01:22:20,820
discord now. It's not just like Twitter going to hell and things like this. It's you know,

879
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:25,460
discord is really, really gaining amongst gamers. I think that's a very clever thing to do. But

880
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:31,860
remember, read the fine print with the game awards. There's a very good reason they don't let the

881
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:37,540
community have the sole voice on these awards. Because the community would pick wrong every time

882
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:43,860
I guarantee I guarantee like, and you might you might be like, that's an awfully mean and short

883
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:50,820
vision thing. No, it's not. Case in point. Look at what the eccentric asshole just did on Twitter.

884
01:22:51,540 --> 01:23:01,780
Bots will ruin everything because some gaming fans with a one track mind are real pieces of work.

885
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:07,780
So we should be thankful that the fan vote is limited to 10%. And the rest of now that so the

886
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:14,180
fan vote can kind of break a tie. But most of it is being done by a panel adjourn a jury vote and

887
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:19,700
things like that of experts. So anyway, the nominees were announced. Here are the nominees

888
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:30,260
for Game of the Year. A Plague Tale Requiem. Elden Dring. God of War Ragnarok. Horizon Forbidden West.

889
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:37,780
Stray. And Xenoblade Chronicles 3. I think Elden Ring has that. That's what it should be,

890
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:42,820
in my opinion. I think God of War Ragnarok is going to take it. And I know there's some

891
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:47,220
controversy behind that. I just feel like the reception I've seen to that game, it got more

892
01:23:47,220 --> 01:23:50,900
nominees than any other game. It actually was nominated more times than Elden Ring.

893
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:55,700
I just have this funny feel but it is it is absolutely between those two.

894
01:23:56,340 --> 01:24:03,380
It's it's none of those other games have a chance. Sorry. But it is absolutely between those two.

895
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:11,380
I would say that. So, um, but interesting. I mean, you know, it's also kind of what if to me that

896
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:17,300
makes it an interesting year because I'm kind of like, there's no surprise indie darling title

897
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:21,780
that kind of gets in there that actually has a chance. No, that actually has a chance is the

898
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:26,500
rest of my sentence. Yes, Stray got nominated. That's great. But it's not gonna win.

899
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:35,780
It's not worth. No, it's a good game. But it's not game of the year material. Yeah. And to me,

900
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:41,860
to me, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is kind of the surprise in there. Not bad. I'm just saying

901
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:46,900
there's always a Nintendo title in there. I'm just a little bit like, oh, I'm actually surprised

902
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:52,740
that game is getting the recognition because usually those games don't and so I'm kind of I'm

903
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:57,460
pleasantly surprised at that one. No, I haven't played it myself. So I have no horse in that race

904
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:01,540
or I can say that was a good decision. That was a bad decision. Just generally the Xenoblade games

905
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:05,060
in general. I'm just kind of like, oh, that's interesting that that one got put in there amongst

906
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:11,380
the other games as like the Nintendo option this year. It is interesting to me. It's interesting

907
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:17,060
that Pokemon Legends, and you'll notice I'm saying that and not Pokemon 9. It's interesting

908
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:21,620
that Pokemon Legends was not the game that got in there as game of the year to me. Or didn't

909
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:27,780
Splatoon come out this year too? Yeah, but I don't I don't think Splatoon 3 was. I think that was

910
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:31,460
nominated in other categories. I'll have to look at the list. But I don't think it was going to be

911
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:38,020
game of the year. It was to the average jurist. They're going to look at it and say it's too

912
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:42,900
derivative of part two to necessitate a nomination. And yes, I already know what you're

913
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:48,740
thinking. God of War Ragnarok is just a sequel to it. It's different. I can't explain it.

914
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:55,460
Look at the Oscars. It's a very similar type of thing. But Shane, I'm curious your thoughts about

915
01:25:55,460 --> 01:26:01,060
like Pokemon Legends or Pokemon 9 not being in the running there as the supreme Pokemon fan here

916
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:07,540
at VOG Network. Well, Scarlet and Violet I don't think came out during like this specific period

917
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:12,580
that the games have to be released in. So not that I would think it would go on there anyway

918
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:21,220
just because of how these awards work. But also I don't think Legends made it because it's not

919
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:26,100
a lot of people consider it like a side game even though it's considered a mainline game.

920
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:32,260
And I don't think they would give any time of day to a side game for a game of the year nomination.

921
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:42,020
Plus, you know, it's I would say it's not as it doesn't have the same broad appeal that these

922
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:46,740
other games do. Like it's not, it's it's sold really well. It still sells really well. But

923
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:52,340
it's not your God of Wars. It's not like the short time that Elden Ring has been out. It's

924
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:57,780
it doesn't have that same sort of buzz. It's for one specific group of people where the other games

925
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:04,100
reach different groups. I will say Pokemon Legends did get nominated in the best role playing

926
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:09,620
category. Now Elden Ring is also in that category. So it's a done deal. But yeah, what I think is

927
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:13,940
interesting about that category, not just the Legends nomination, but also in role playing,

928
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:21,140
a live alive is nominated this year. Oh, random. It is like, is it just is it just there because

929
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:25,700
we finally got it over here? Well, that's the only reason because it has to be that's a great

930
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:30,180
question to be honest. And that's why I'm kind of like, oh, that's interesting. But I think it also

931
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:36,180
really bodes well for the Square Enix wanting to go back and redo old, you know, potentially

932
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:40,820
Enix properties as well as Square Super Nintendo games. I think this all but cements we're going

933
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:47,060
to see another one. So, you know, just just how well this has been received by the public I think

934
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:51,220
is this is really a sign of. So that's very interesting. Some of the other categories that

935
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:57,220
are always interesting to me are things like the best ongoing game because these are games that

936
01:27:57,220 --> 01:28:00,980
are already out. But the award acknowledges that this is still, you know, a game that's doing,

937
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:06,260
you know, very well for the community. Apex Legends, Destiny 2, who I feel like is nominated

938
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:12,340
every year. Final Fantasy 14, I also feel like it's nominated every year, rightfully so. Fortnite,

939
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:17,860
completely unsurprising to be quite honest. Genshin Impact, I kind of think Genshin's the

940
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:23,620
the dark horse in that race. My heart is with Final Fantasy 14, of course, but I feel like

941
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:28,260
I feel like an Apex or a Genshin Impact kind of sneaks in there this year and grabs that award,

942
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:34,740
but we'll see. We'll see. Best Performance is also worth noting. I like that they call it

943
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:39,380
Best Performance because as we've been learning more and more in the gaming industry, it's not

944
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:46,660
just voice acting. It's also mocap for a lot of games now. Ashley Birch from Horizon Forbidden

945
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:52,740
West, Sharlik McBurney from A Plague Tale Requiem, Christopher Judge from God of War Ragnarok,

946
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:58,980
Sunny Soljek also from God of War Ragnarok, and Man and Gage also, or excuse me, from Immortality

947
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:03,940
are the nominees in that category this year. It's interesting they don't split it into like major

948
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:09,220
role, minor role, or anything like that. Interesting. There's just one kind of catch-all

949
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:14,020
category, but that is interesting. I just say like, where did this A Plague's Tale,

950
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:19,460
like, overwhelming love come from? Because I've heard of the first one and I kind of

951
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:24,820
heard of the second one, but getting so many nominations just feels really out of left field

952
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:30,020
to me. It might be a good game. I haven't played it. I've watched Dreamer play it. It looked,

953
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:34,340
it looked nice. Like the graphics were very good and I'm just assuming it has a really

954
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:42,100
compelling story to it. So yeah, it just, it just seems like the, not the indie darling that they

955
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:48,020
have to put on the list, but like maybe the title that they put on there to show that they only,

956
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:56,180
they don't only take the biggest name titles for their nominations. But I do hear it's good. I just,

957
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:59,620
I've never heard anything about it. I don't even know what gameplay style it is.

958
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:06,260
DJ Roma S in chat says, I call bullshit on God of War. Orange Wright says, God of War Ragnarok

959
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:10,820
just came out. Deft is talking about his phone call on Bobby's show earlier tonight where like,

960
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:16,820
I don't mind the nomination, but SIFU being considered best fighting game is, is ridiculous.

961
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:21,300
And then DJ Roma S says, dude, that game just came out. It's a slap in the face of the other

962
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:25,140
contenders. Here's the thing. And I know this isn't the popular answer Rama, but it's just,

963
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:31,780
I'm just going to break it down. It's like the Oscars. This, the same thing happens in the Oscars

964
01:30:31,780 --> 01:30:36,580
all the time. And the, and the game awards are absolutely going to be at this point.

965
01:30:36,580 --> 01:30:42,900
The Oscars get to this point where it is literally a campaign season and the movie doesn't get wide

966
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:52,340
release until January or February, even though the cutoff is in December 31st. And it like movies

967
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:58,500
that get nominated for Oscars almost all of the time release in like one theater in LA that all

968
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:02,420
of the industry people end up seeing. So, so regular people like you and me don't end up seeing

969
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:09,140
it like for one weekend just to be Oscar eligible. And then the entire push is around the awards that

970
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:16,900
it receives. Like this is an industry game in the movie area. And I, what I see with God of War

971
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:23,140
Ragnarok here in part, I think is kind of that, but I actually don't think that's on the developers.

972
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:28,580
The reality is the game awards are just timed really weird because yes, for ever since the

973
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:34,020
beginning of time in this industry, big releases are always around Thanksgiving. They want to get

974
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:39,300
on the shelves before Black Friday. We all know that's when the games release. So really, I think,

975
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:43,300
I don't think the problem is when the games are releasing. The problem is the game awards would

976
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:48,900
probably be better timed in January or February, but that's not what Jeff Keighley wants to do. And

977
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:53,380
that's not the vision that he has for the awards ceremony. And so that's how we end up in this

978
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:57,300
position. So I actually, I don't fault the publishers pushing their games for Game of the Year

979
01:31:57,300 --> 01:32:00,820
and all this stuff, because you know, the games are going to release when they release. The game

980
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:05,940
awards ought to be in January or February if the public is to have more time to play them. But I,

981
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:10,660
I absolutely understand the frustration where it's like, well, if the public can vote on this,

982
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:15,700
how am I supposed to vote for something I haven't had time to play? And that's why I say, well,

983
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:21,620
it's good that the public's vote for all intents and purposes barely counts. Right?

984
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:27,860
Yeah. Anyway. But if we want to go again, if we want to look at the Oscars and the film industry

985
01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:32,900
and that whole thing, this year is going to be very interesting. And I want to say it was

986
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:36,260
interesting. A couple of years ago, there was another movie that bucked the trend,

987
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:42,980
but there is still a lot of Oscar buzz. And in my opinion, 100% rightfully so around the movie,

988
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:48,500
Everything, Everywhere, All at Once. That movie came out way earlier this year. But I'm telling

989
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:54,580
you, if Michelle Yeoh does not get nominated for best actress, gays will be rioting in the streets

990
01:32:54,580 --> 01:33:01,140
as will be, as will people of lots of orientations, because I think we can all agree,

991
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:06,820
she deserves an Oscar nomination. Quite frankly, Ki Hui Kwan who, you know, hasn't acted in a

992
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:12,420
movie in like 40 years or however long it's been. Also, I think a lot of people will be, you know,

993
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:16,020
throwing hands if he doesn't get a best supporting actor nomination for that movie.

994
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:19,220
So there's a lot of people that are wanting to go to bat for that movie.

995
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:22,100
It'll be interesting to see if it does get nominated or not. Because again,

996
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:29,060
those types of releases tend to get forgotten about. And that's the other frustration. Games

997
01:33:29,060 --> 01:33:35,380
or movies that don't get nominated because they came out just after the cutoff. Quick aside,

998
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:39,300
sorry, but while I'm on this tangent, just looking at other industries, other war shows,

999
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:45,060
you know who else has a fucking weird cutoff window? The Grammys. Now, I can't stand the

1000
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:49,140
Grammys personally. But the Grammy because I just they've been getting it wrong for years

1001
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:52,980
and years and years. Go look at what The Weeknd said about the Grammys a few years ago, why he

1002
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:57,700
doesn't participate. That's been true about the Grammys for a long time. They have a lot of things

1003
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:06,580
to fix. But the Grammys also have a very strange cutoff window. And so like you have a situation

1004
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:13,060
where a band that's near and dear to my heart, ABBA, got nominated last year for their comeback

1005
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:17,380
single. So they got nominated for the single that came out in advance of their album.

1006
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:24,900
They got nominated for that. But this year now they get nominated for the actual album

1007
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:29,140
and a different single that I think more people actually enjoy. Don't Shut Me Down,

1008
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:33,540
the one that actually sounded like an old ABBA song. Those got nominated for this year's Grammys.

1009
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:37,140
ABBA will not, they didn't win last year and they won't win this year either because

1010
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:43,540
Beyonce train is unstoppable period end of sentence. But it's interesting that they get

1011
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:50,340
nominated essentially that that first song gets nominated, which is on that Voyage album and then

1012
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:55,220
the second song gets nominated this year. So it's another one of those award shows that has a weird

1013
01:34:55,220 --> 01:35:03,620
ass cutoff date, for sure. So anyway, let's see Bobby Blackwell in chat says at the start of the

1014
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:07,860
award season game publishers and developers are provided with an access to a list of outlets that

1015
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:12,180
will submit nomination ballots. While most of our voting outlets have access to games through the

1016
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:16,740
normal editorial process, publishers and developers are permitted to provide review copies or digital

1017
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:21,380
redemption codes. To meet our balloting deadlines, publishers or developers may provide advance or

1018
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:26,740
pre-release access to games for critical evaluation. I'm assuming that is copy posted for the website.

1019
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:31,940
And that reads to me screener copies. Infamous in the movie industry, right, Loki?

1020
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:39,060
I joke because Loki used to get a lot of screener copies. We used to watch a lot of

1021
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:46,020
movies before they were out. Yes. So I mean, they have the annoying watermark on the bottom or

1022
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:49,700
the other weird that some of them would go to black and white randomly. Like that was the

1023
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:54,580
copy protection thing. But yeah, I remember watching so many movies before they were

1024
01:35:54,660 --> 01:36:00,260
released on DVD through that. Yep. So I remember that screener copies.

1025
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:07,540
All right. Anyway, let's move on. We spent way too much time talking about awards. Sorry,

1026
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:10,900
but I want to respond to this stuff in chat. That was some good, good feedback in chat.

1027
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:17,140
All right. Let's talk about this next story, which I think is, Loki, are you doing this one? Sorry,

1028
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:29,700
behind? Yeah, Loki's on it. Yeah, yeah. So this is cool. archive.org has now received all 285 issues

1029
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:38,740
of Nintendo power, which was uploaded, I guess by gumball. And you can now view them unofficially

1030
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:46,100
in CBR format, which is it's about 40 gigabytes might want to download that before it's already

1031
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:55,460
gone. Oh, dang it. Yeah. Dang it. Nintendo. Well, I'm sure somebody right click saved all before

1032
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:59,780
metaphorically. I mean, obviously, if it's been uploaded once on the internet,

1033
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:07,060
there's a torrent out there. Absolutely. Yeah, well, yeah. In fact, Tiger Claw in chat says

1034
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:10,580
the archive was taken down, but you can download them from a torrent that I linked to on the

1035
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:17,300
discord, of course, of course. So you know, Nintendo, I mean, I don't know, since it was

1036
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:24,500
your magazine, and all. You could put digital versions of this as part of the Nintendo online

1037
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:30,100
service, and people could just browse them using their switch. It's like, almost no effort.

1038
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:37,620
And in fact, somebody's done all the scanning work for you really, and it adds to the value

1039
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:43,300
that you would get with Nintendo online. Just a thought, you know, just since you're going to be

1040
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:51,140
litigious and take it down anyways. They won't. They won't. Of course, effort, minimal effort,

1041
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:55,380
minimal effort. All right. Well, speaking of classics, we have the next segment for you.

1042
01:37:55,380 --> 01:38:11,620
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1043
01:38:11,620 --> 01:38:16,580
out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

1044
01:38:17,380 --> 01:38:22,260
All right, except it's actually not going to be Dark Sakura talking about it tonight. It's going

1045
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:26,500
to be me because I picked the game tonight because Dark Sakura's out of town. And unfortunately,

1046
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:31,700
with everything that was going on, she did not have time to record something in advance. So,

1047
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:35,780
I will be talking about the classic game tonight. And the game that I have picked tonight is a

1048
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:41,780
NES game that I remember fondly called The Magic of Scheherazade. Or when I was a kid,

1049
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:45,540
I used to mispronounce this all the time. As you might notice, mispronunciation has been a running

1050
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:52,100
theme in my life. I think I used to call this Scheherazade. That's what I used to call this

1051
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:55,860
game. Did anybody else ever play this game? And what did you got? Loki, did you ever play this

1052
01:38:55,860 --> 01:39:00,180
game? All right. Shane, have you ever heard of this game?

1053
01:39:00,180 --> 01:39:01,060
No, it was terrible.

1054
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:07,220
Oh, no. This game, look, on a technical level, it wasn't great, but this game actually did some

1055
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:14,820
really cool things I want to talk about. So, The Magic of Scheherazade, it was part action RPG and

1056
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:20,820
part straight up RPG. And that's what made this game very unique. It was released in Japan in

1057
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:26,820
1987, but it didn't come out in North America until 1990. So, there was actually quite a gap

1058
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:31,700
in the time it took to get this game translated and localized. It was released by Culture Brain,

1059
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:37,860
who did a lot of unique NES titles. And it's, of course, you can probably guess based on the name.

1060
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:43,860
It's based on Middle Eastern folk tales from 1001 Nights. You are attempting to rescue the Princess

1061
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:49,780
of Scheherazade from Sabaron, who, of course, has summoned demons, chaos, and all the bad things to

1062
01:39:49,780 --> 01:39:54,740
Arabia where this game takes place. The game is divided into chapter. And as I mentioned,

1063
01:39:54,740 --> 01:40:01,380
it is both action adventure RPG. Think The Legend of Zelda combined with more classic,

1064
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:08,980
say, Dragon Warrior at the time, or Final Fantasy RPG style. So, you go through the overworld at a

1065
01:40:08,980 --> 01:40:15,140
top-down perspective. You can attack enemies with your sword and so forth, both in real-time action,

1066
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:19,620
but sometimes there will be random turn-based battles that you fight with allies at your side.

1067
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:22,980
Again, kind of like you're playing Dragon Warrior 2 or something like that.

1068
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:27,380
I know why this game sounds familiar. Didn't Strong Bad write a song about this?

1069
01:40:28,420 --> 01:40:33,700
Oh, I don't know. Maybe. Somebody in chat might know. I don't know.

1070
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:37,620
It just reminded me of Everybody to the Limit.

1071
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:43,300
Yeah, looking at comments in chat. Darkstalkers actually in chat, hopefully gives a blessing to

1072
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:47,060
this choice, says, and apparently gamble for corgis. Yes, that's what's happening in the

1073
01:40:47,060 --> 01:40:50,820
sequence we're watching right now, is that apparently there's a wheel of corgis and

1074
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:54,500
penguins and other animals. There's a gambling mini-game that's going on in the game right now.

1075
01:40:54,500 --> 01:41:00,020
But it also just goes to show the amount of variety, which even though, yeah, it didn't

1076
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:05,620
age well. The graphics kind of look like a hot mess. But at the time, to see all these different

1077
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:11,220
genres combined in one game, that's what makes this game unique and worthy of a classic to me.

1078
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:15,700
It's just, you know, we love when, like, genres get mishmashed together. Like,

1079
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:21,060
look at one of our all-time faves, the Guardian Legend. That's like part Zelda, part Gradius,

1080
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:26,020
or maybe, I'm sorry, yeah, Life Force, kind of combined into one game, because I'm thinking

1081
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:31,300
vertical scrolling, combined into one game. So, that's kind of part of the reason why I think

1082
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:37,540
this game is unique. Anyway, let's see. What else do I want to say about it? Enemies will appear in

1083
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:42,500
the overworld. They're fought in real time. You can use a sword. You can use a rod for projectiles

1084
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:47,620
and magic spells. You get experience points, of course, that increase your levels. HP and MP go

1085
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:52,500
up as you level up. If you are transitioning between screens on the overhead map, sometimes

1086
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:57,460
you will encounter a turn-based battle with groups of enemies. The start of the battle gives you the

1087
01:41:57,460 --> 01:42:02,180
option to fight, escape, or bribe enemies into leaving. That's also kind of a unique mechanic

1088
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:06,420
at the time. You fight alone or with two other people in your party, and it's a little more like

1089
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:14,260
a traditional RPG in that sense. Formations, which you learn at magic universities, can be created,

1090
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:20,340
which give you added defense or cast powerful group magic spell. So, certain formations work

1091
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:26,180
against certain squads or regiments in the game. You can also hire mercenary troopers. Again,

1092
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:31,460
there's a lot going on in this game. So, it's just interesting that it doesn't do any of these

1093
01:42:31,460 --> 01:42:36,100
genres particularly well, but the fact that they fit all of this in one game is pretty impressive.

1094
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:41,220
The Magic of Scheherazade was developed for the NES or the Famicom in Japan by Culture Brain.

1095
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:47,780
A person that was working under a pseudonym, Academia Yuminisuke, was the game's producer.

1096
01:42:47,780 --> 01:42:51,780
That was in a weekly Famitsu interview that that came from. Composers for the game were

1097
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:59,060
Akinora Sawa and Sunichi Mikame. Sawa worked on the Hiryu no Ken series with Culture Brain,

1098
01:42:59,060 --> 01:43:03,620
and Mikame worked on Kung Fu Heroes, which I saw someone shouted that out in chat also from

1099
01:43:03,620 --> 01:43:10,980
Culture Brain, and Flying Dragon. Compositions were recorded to audio cassette and then simplified

1100
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:15,060
to the Famicom sound generator once it was approved by the producer. I think that's

1101
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:20,420
interesting. Only three of the six songs that Mikame composed were used in the game. He left

1102
01:43:20,420 --> 01:43:24,820
the company before the game was actually released. There was an official strategy guide for the game

1103
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:30,420
released in November of 1987. There was a short manga based on the game called Magical Book

1104
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:34,340
that features all the party members from the game in it. Okay, I think I'm sick of watching

1105
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:37,860
corgi gambling on our stream. We need to fast forward to a little more action. Looks like

1106
01:43:37,860 --> 01:43:43,060
there's a turn-based battle there. We can take a look at that. All right. Sorry, just I wanted

1107
01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:49,540
to adjust what our live viewers are seeing on Twitch. Let's see. Then what happened after that?

1108
01:43:49,540 --> 01:43:55,940
Culture Brain USA announced the game for mid-1988 with a release date then scheduled for January

1109
01:43:55,940 --> 01:44:02,340
1989. It was delayed, but it was showcased at the Winter CES with games like Kung Fu Heroes

1110
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:07,860
and Flying Dragon The Secret Scroll. It was showcased then again at the 1990 Winter CES,

1111
01:44:07,860 --> 01:44:14,100
this time alongside Baseball Simulator 1.0, and the game finally came out on January 15, 1990.

1112
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:17,780
Changes were made for the English language version, including animation of character and

1113
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:22,980
monster sprites, changes of facial features for the characters to look a little more nondescript,

1114
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:29,940
simplification of the overworld map, character text during gameplay, and new music. The reviews

1115
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:37,140
when the game was released were mixed. EGM gave it a 22 out of 40. Famitsu gave it a 27 out of 40.

1116
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:42,580
Video games and computer entertainment gave it a 6 out of 10. But the publication game players gave

1117
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:49,300
it their best graphics award in 1989. So, it seemed like it was a little bit kind of what I

1118
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:55,940
was saying earlier. The compliments were, wow, this game does a lot. The feedback on what it

1119
01:44:55,940 --> 01:45:03,540
could have done better is, wow, it does none of those things particularly well. So, and honestly,

1120
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:08,740
I do agree, but I play, I rented this game. I never owned it, but I remember renting this from

1121
01:45:08,740 --> 01:45:13,700
the video store at least two or three times because I thought, you know, I liked RPGs,

1122
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:19,860
I like Zelda, I like Final Fantasy, and I just thought, A, you didn't see a lot of games in like,

1123
01:45:19,860 --> 01:45:25,700
you know, this sort of universe, like the, you know, the Arabian kind of setting that this game

1124
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:29,940
has. You see a lot of games like that and the uniqueness of those different, you know, I always

1125
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:35,700
liked when game genres collided, like I mentioned the Guardian Legend, but also I think about things

1126
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:40,900
like Goemon or The Legend of the Mystical Ninja and like the random shit you did in those games

1127
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:45,460
when you, you know, like Gradius being built into the game was just like the weirdest thing. I

1128
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:51,460
always liked that kind of stuff and they were always like fun games to rent. Anyway, what's

1129
01:45:51,460 --> 01:45:56,980
interesting is that you also know people that have kind of missed this game. This game has been

1130
01:45:56,980 --> 01:46:02,420
mentioned that it is noticeably absent from the Virtual Console service. You remember when Nintendo

1131
01:46:02,420 --> 01:46:06,900
was putting everything out on the Nintendo Wii, this game probably deserved another shot on that

1132
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:10,340
service because like Kung Fu Heroes and some of the other Culture Brain stuff got released,

1133
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:16,660
but not this one, which is interesting. A sequel to the game was planned. It was listed by Nintendo

1134
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:24,100
for a 1990 release for the NES. The sequel was then noted in Game Pro in the September 1990

1135
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:28,980
issue for the summer CES. It then came up in Nintendo Power, and now we can check the archives

1136
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:36,100
to see it, in the November-December 1990 issue. At the winter CES in January 1992,

1137
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:41,220
a Super Nintendo game called Golden Empire was announced by Culture Brain as a follow-up to

1138
01:46:41,220 --> 01:46:47,460
The Magic of Scheherazade. Then a year later, the 1993 winter CES, the game was apparently called

1139
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:53,780
Golden Empire The Legend of Scheherazade. And then a gaming retail chain at the time,

1140
01:46:53,780 --> 01:47:01,700
Chips and Bits advertised the game. And as late as 1996, the Japanese magazine,

1141
01:47:01,700 --> 01:47:08,020
Family Computer Magazine, listed the game as Scheherazade Densetsu, the Prelude, with a

1142
01:47:08,020 --> 01:47:13,460
TBA sort of date. And of course, that's it. That's all we know. The game never came out.

1143
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:20,020
So, it was mysteriously sacked. Just, I guess, was never really able to truly be finished. So,

1144
01:47:20,660 --> 01:47:24,740
Questbuster in chat brings up another fun fact, which I think this is neat. Magic of

1145
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:31,860
Scheherazade broke into Nintendo Power's top 30 in the July and August issue in 1990 at number 15,

1146
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:39,540
ahead of Willow, number 16, and just behind Dragon Warrior. Well, yeah, this game was incredibly

1147
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:43,700
unique. And I think that's why a lot of people remember it. Again, not every game that gets

1148
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:49,300
picked for the Classic Game of the Week is necessarily memorable because it was good. But

1149
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:53,300
I think games that we remember fondly are games that kind of make us go, huh,

1150
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:58,580
that was interesting, are certainly worthy. And to me, that's the Magic of Scheherazade,

1151
01:47:58,580 --> 01:48:03,540
a game that I think was very interesting in the way that it sort of mishmashed different genres.

1152
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:07,860
So, I would encourage you to check this out. And unfortunately, there's no legal way to do it. So,

1153
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:11,220
I'm going to have to tell you to turn to emulation to look at it, or, you know,

1154
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:14,900
watch a long play on YouTube or something like that. But I think the game is interesting.

1155
01:48:15,860 --> 01:48:20,820
So, even though, yeah, it probably didn't age great, and you're probably going to be like,

1156
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:26,740
oh, God, some of these graphics, like, you can see how the frames, I mean, if you think technical

1157
01:48:26,740 --> 01:48:32,340
problems in today's games are bad, check out some of the stuff on the NES. Anyway, there it is,

1158
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:36,580
your Classic Game of the Week. Neither of you ever played that game?

1159
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:37,780
I did not.

1160
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:39,460
That's what I'm aware of.

1161
01:48:39,460 --> 01:48:43,540
Yeah, it was pretty, I liked it. It was unique. It was different. I try to remember if the

1162
01:48:43,540 --> 01:48:47,140
cartridge was different, too, because some of the Culture Brain cartridges were different.

1163
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:51,380
But I don't think that one was. I don't recall it being so anyway.

1164
01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:58,340
All right. Dark Soccer will be back in two weeks, and she'll take over the Classic Game segment

1165
01:48:58,340 --> 01:49:02,820
again. So, I think this means next week, Loki, I think that means it's your turn next week.

1166
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:03,540
Sound good?

1167
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:04,580
Oh, boy.

1168
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:08,980
Oh, boy. Don't pick anything that's going to get you in trouble. That's all I'm going to say.

1169
01:49:08,980 --> 01:49:10,820
Oh, I'm not picking Halo.

1170
01:49:10,820 --> 01:49:13,140
All right. Yeah, I was going to say, don't pick anything that's going to get you in trouble.

1171
01:49:13,780 --> 01:49:21,700
Don't pick Halo 2 either. All right. All right. I'm sure there's lots of games,

1172
01:49:21,700 --> 01:49:26,580
10 years or older, that are Loki noteworthy. Hell, God, the original Saints Row probably

1173
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:27,780
qualified at this point.

1174
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:28,980
Maybe we did that one.

1175
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:30,660
Oh, did we? All right. Well, fair enough.

1176
01:49:30,660 --> 01:49:31,780
Maybe. I don't know.

1177
01:49:31,780 --> 01:49:37,780
All right. Check the wiki. All right. Let's go now to some rapid fire news and travel

1178
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:41,060
around the industry and look at some other headlines pretty quickly here.

1179
01:49:41,060 --> 01:49:45,940
So, oh, dark soccer in chat says new OLR dream game, corky gambling.

1180
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:53,620
I'm kind of into it. Like dogs playing poker. I'm kind of into it. It's cute. All right. Anyway,

1181
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:55,300
rapid fire news. Loki, let's go to you.

1182
01:49:56,500 --> 01:50:05,460
Yeah. So, apparently, Las Vegas Raiders linebacker Blake Martinez has decided to retire mid season

1183
01:50:06,020 --> 01:50:12,660
because he is making enough money selling Pokemon cards that he can retire. In fact,

1184
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:24,260
he just recently sold an illustrator, Pikachu, that was a mint 9.5, and he sold that for $672,000.

1185
01:50:26,180 --> 01:50:29,860
So, he's making money selling Pokemon cards. No need to play football anymore.

1186
01:50:29,860 --> 01:50:33,380
That's interesting. Not a headline I would have thought.

1187
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:38,660
There's a lot of football players that make more money than that, but I guess, you know,

1188
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:42,180
for the average football player, that's probably better than the salary.

1189
01:50:42,180 --> 01:50:48,020
He's only 28, too. So, I mean, like, he probably has quite a bit of time that he could, you know.

1190
01:50:48,660 --> 01:50:52,980
He's got to invest that money. I mean, when all is said and done, $600,000 is going to last,

1191
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:55,540
but maybe combined with the NFL money, it's pretty good.

1192
01:50:55,540 --> 01:51:00,740
Or maybe that's just one card out of all the ones he's selling. I don't know how big he is in that.

1193
01:51:00,740 --> 01:51:03,860
Shane, haven't you been getting more into the card game a little bit or at

1194
01:51:03,860 --> 01:51:08,420
least collecting the different cards? Only for the ones I care about. Like,

1195
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:13,140
I don't do it for, like, the rare expensive ones. I do it for the Oshawott cards or

1196
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:17,220
one that I think looks cool. Or the soon to be released

1197
01:51:17,220 --> 01:51:18,900
Quaxley cards, I'm sure. Yes.

1198
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:26,100
Fair enough. All right. What else, Logie? Apparently, Blizzard is keen on selling

1199
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:30,820
Overwatch 2 skins for players they have temporarily disabled. So you can buy

1200
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:36,900
a brand new skin for Mei. However, because they've temporarily disabled her because of

1201
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:43,220
her ice wall ability and the bug in that, you can't play with the new skin.

1202
01:51:44,420 --> 01:51:50,340
But they're apparently bringing her back. Well, they apparently already have brought her back

1203
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:57,060
or was supposed to bring her back by November 15th. But it has also been delayed because

1204
01:51:57,060 --> 01:52:04,260
of a issue in the launch of the patch to address a critical issue so soon.

1205
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:09,380
Have to be honest. I haven't really touched Overwatch 2 since that first week. And now it's

1206
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:14,340
just kind of there. So I don't know. I haven't been following the latest and greatest of the game,

1207
01:52:14,340 --> 01:52:20,500
but it'll be interesting to see if the, I guess, like all the hype that was there that

1208
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:24,180
first week would Overwatch 2 launch, like how much of that is still there around the holidays,

1209
01:52:24,180 --> 01:52:27,300
you know, as we get in towards the end of the year and next year and season two

1210
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:30,260
Battle Pass really will be the real telling thing. Because that's where they're making

1211
01:52:30,260 --> 01:52:34,980
their money now, right? Yeah. Speaking of Blizzard, even though we didn't have it show

1212
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:38,260
rolled, Shane, you had brought something to me up before the show tonight. And I was like,

1213
01:52:38,260 --> 01:52:40,980
Oh, yeah, maybe we should bring that up. Did you want to talk about that?

1214
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:49,620
Oh, yeah, sure. So starting January 23 of next year, all Blizzard games, all the major ones,

1215
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:55,860
except for Diablo Immortal will have their services suspended in China, even though they're

1216
01:52:55,860 --> 01:53:01,860
about to sell like the new WoW expansion and the next season of Overwatch 2 is going to happen.

1217
01:53:02,820 --> 01:53:08,180
I guess they couldn't come to an agreement with NetEase, their China partner. And so those

1218
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:13,060
services are just going to go away. So I don't know what that means for like, the Chinese

1219
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:19,220
Overwatch League teams, or, you know, all the players there, they are, can they use VPNs? I

1220
01:53:19,220 --> 01:53:24,100
don't know how strict it is. But they're kind of out of luck, for at least the time being.

1221
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:31,460
Blizzard said something about being willing to revisit like their games in the future there,

1222
01:53:31,460 --> 01:53:35,220
but doesn't sound like it's going to be anytime soon. Interesting. I wonder if they'll team up

1223
01:53:35,220 --> 01:53:39,300
with a different publisher, but then you got to wonder how the Chinese gaming community is going

1224
01:53:39,300 --> 01:53:42,740
to react to this. Because I imagine there's going to be a lot of people over there that are going

1225
01:53:42,740 --> 01:53:50,820
to be like, well, fuck Blizzard then, you know? Yeah, maybe. I know Immortal was made with NetEase.

1226
01:53:50,820 --> 01:53:56,660
So they still have some sort of relationship, but I do not understand what happened to,

1227
01:53:57,380 --> 01:54:00,980
you know, effectively kill their entire lineup there.

1228
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:08,260
Yeah, that's a, that's a big, that's a big, you know, like, failing, really, of them not

1229
01:54:08,260 --> 01:54:12,820
be able to renegotiate the agreement, especially when they're not like turning around and saying,

1230
01:54:12,820 --> 01:54:16,900
and we're going to this publisher and set instead, like Blizzard did not have a second suitor lined

1231
01:54:16,900 --> 01:54:22,020
up. So it's a really odd thing to just have suddenly terminate, you know? Yeah, it's especially

1232
01:54:22,580 --> 01:54:29,140
when they went all in on that one controversy on Overwatch, like, now they're like, whatever,

1233
01:54:29,140 --> 01:54:34,500
we don't need China. We don't care. As Joe and Matt in chat says, the line to say F you to

1234
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:39,620
Blizzard goes around the block. Well, yeah, with this in China, this news, this is not going to go

1235
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:44,100
over well, I'm sure. God, can you imagine like all that time that some people have been investing

1236
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:49,300
into their profiles like a wow character? Can you imagine, Shane, if like, they came out tomorrow

1237
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:53,300
and said, you know what, due to a disagreement with Square Enix, we're just turning off Final

1238
01:54:53,300 --> 01:55:00,900
Fantasy 14 in America next month, like crazy, that would be awful. I mean, you were onto it,

1239
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:07,220
there'd be so many people that would be like, private servers, VPN, actually, I heard about

1240
01:55:07,220 --> 01:55:12,340
a private Final Fantasy 11 server that just I've heard about, I've actually been on them before,

1241
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:18,420
like, there's some new one that just launched, because they're one of my LGBT gaming servers

1242
01:55:19,060 --> 01:55:23,300
was recruiting for a link shell and that and I was actually tempted. Like, again, it's one of

1243
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:29,140
those things where it's like, if you didn't go live the same day as Pokemon, I would have been

1244
01:55:29,140 --> 01:55:37,060
tempted by this. Yeah, it was. What were you saying? I don't want to be dragged back into

1245
01:55:37,060 --> 01:55:41,940
a Final Fantasy 11. Again, I know, I know. But something needs to be done on the fun, though,

1246
01:55:41,940 --> 01:55:47,220
I did play on a mod server for a brief period of time. And they had the level they had, like,

1247
01:55:47,220 --> 01:55:52,660
basically, it was like a 30 x leveling or something like that. So you got 30 x XP from

1248
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:56,260
everything. It was great, because you could like solo a whole bunch of stuff you wouldn't normally

1249
01:55:56,260 --> 01:56:01,620
be able to. I would go look up the name of this, but it's in Discord. And Discord is how I'm

1250
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:06,740
putting your face through to the stream right now. So I can't switch windows. But I'm, I'll have to

1251
01:56:06,740 --> 01:56:11,460
look it up after the show and send it, you know, but again, not that like I could send I could

1252
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:16,660
send something Final Fantasy 11 or 14 to Shane and it's like until the Pokedex is done. She doesn't

1253
01:56:16,660 --> 01:56:21,700
have time for anything else, right? It's very true. Except maybe rating because there's this,

1254
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:27,700
there's a social contract with rating, but that's really it. So all right, moving on. Let's talk

1255
01:56:27,700 --> 01:56:35,860
about some DLC that is incoming for Splatoon 3. More content and stuff for Splatoon 3 this

1256
01:56:35,860 --> 01:56:40,740
December. Starting on December 1, if you have an active Nintendo Switch Online membership,

1257
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:46,420
you're going to get Chill Season 2022. That's weapon and stages, new gear, victory emotes,

1258
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:53,780
game modes. And there's a video that has all of that as well. Big Run is coming. It puts a twist

1259
01:56:53,780 --> 01:57:00,020
in Salmon Run. Big Run is going to take place when the Salmonoids invade the Wahoo world stage later

1260
01:57:00,020 --> 01:57:05,300
this year. And there'll be more details that come out soon. There's also going to be X Battles where

1261
01:57:05,300 --> 01:57:09,700
you have to get to an elite rank in anarchy battles and you risk X power to challenge your

1262
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:13,940
way up the leaderboards. X Battles are coming out December 1 as well. Three new weapons,

1263
01:57:13,940 --> 01:57:19,940
a new roller, a new charger, new shooter, and 10 returning weapons from previous Splatoon games.

1264
01:57:19,940 --> 01:57:25,140
And now some of them have modified sets. There will also be new stages added, including

1265
01:57:25,940 --> 01:57:33,860
Brine Water Springs and Flounder Heights from the first Splatoon game. So more fun stuff there. But

1266
01:57:33,860 --> 01:57:38,020
again, you have to have a Nintendo Switch Online. I don't know, is that premium online or is that

1267
01:57:38,020 --> 01:57:49,940
just any online? If you're getting the DLC, it's probably the premium one. It depends on how they

1268
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:56,740
term the DLC. If it's DLC, then it's going to require purchasing. But it sounds to me mostly

1269
01:57:56,740 --> 01:58:01,140
just like a title update. It does sound like a title update, doesn't it? Which should be free.

1270
01:58:01,140 --> 01:58:05,300
Because again, things like new stages and stuff, they're going to go into the rotation for everyone.

1271
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:09,380
You can't just have DLC. Only people get those stages. So I feel like a lot of that's going to

1272
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:13,380
just be open for everyone. But I can see how you have to have Nintendo Switch Online to do it

1273
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:19,460
because those are all things that you play online. Yeah. And it's... Right. That's why I would think

1274
01:58:19,460 --> 01:58:24,660
it would be the expansion pass if they are going to actual DLC route and not just like a patch.

1275
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:29,300
Yeah. All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some things

1276
01:58:29,300 --> 01:58:35,460
you'll be able to play this week. Although I think now we're going to... Yeah. Black Friday

1277
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:41,300
is this Friday. And so games usually don't release on Black Friday. Although there might be some

1278
01:58:41,300 --> 01:58:46,340
digital surprises. I don't know, but let's check in anyway. Yeah. So we've got Evil West,

1279
01:58:46,340 --> 01:58:52,740
which is out on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series. Five Nights at Freddy's

1280
01:58:52,740 --> 01:59:02,100
Security Breach on Xbox One and Xbox Series. Gungrave Gore on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,

1281
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:08,980
Xbox One and Xbox Series. And last but not least, Ship of Fools on PC, Nintendo Switch,

1282
01:59:08,980 --> 01:59:13,940
PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series. All right. And if you pull up the year updates for me while I do

1283
01:59:13,940 --> 01:59:18,100
Japan... Of course, I already did it. Awesome. I'm already on top of this. Thank you. I'm right on

1284
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:22,980
top of that, Rose. Anyway, looking to Japan, which obviously it's a little different because

1285
01:59:22,980 --> 01:59:27,540
Thanksgiving is not a factor over there. So they do have some releases this week on the Nintendo

1286
01:59:27,540 --> 01:59:31,860
Switch. The Binding of Isaac Repentance gets its Japanese release, although the game is still in

1287
01:59:31,860 --> 01:59:39,460
English, but it is getting released officially in Japan. Kono Subarashi Sekai ni Shuku Fukuo

1288
01:59:39,460 --> 01:59:44,820
also comes out this week in a regular and a limited edition. We also have a game called

1289
01:59:44,820 --> 01:59:51,060
Harvest Over Ray is out on the Switch this week. Matchpoints Tennis Championships is also out this

1290
01:59:51,060 --> 01:59:56,740
week in Japan. And then Omori is out, also an English game, but they are putting it out

1291
01:59:57,300 --> 02:00:06,740
anyway in Japan this week. And a price reduction for several games in the Fushigi no Gensokyo

1292
02:00:07,140 --> 02:00:15,780
series, including Reloaded and Lotus Labyrinth R. Also of interest, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl

1293
02:00:16,580 --> 02:00:21,860
is released in Japan this week, which is interesting. So that is all out this week in Japan.

1294
02:00:21,860 --> 02:00:28,900
Going over to the PlayStation 5 and checking out the releases there, Solstice, not to be confused

1295
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:33,300
with the amazing NES classic that I'm sure I've picked as the classic game of the week at some

1296
02:00:33,300 --> 02:00:40,260
point. This is a different game. It's called S-O-U-L, Solstice, which I don't know much about this

1297
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:44,740
game, but it looks like it has some neat graphics to it. So that's kind of neat. So that is out on

1298
02:00:44,740 --> 02:00:49,860
the PlayStation 5 this week. And that seems to be the major release over there. Now we can go to

1299
02:00:49,860 --> 02:00:56,420
Europe. All right. In Europe, we've got Evil West coming out on PlayStation and Xbox, Farming

1300
02:00:56,420 --> 02:01:07,460
Simulator 22 Platinum Edition on PC, PlayStation and Xbox, Gungrave Gore on PlayStation and Xbox,

1301
02:01:07,460 --> 02:01:13,220
and of course Just Dance 2023 Edition on PlayStation, Xbox and Switch.

1302
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:18,100
All right. All right. We have a few more stories and then we'll invite some calls. We'll see if

1303
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:26,340
anyone wants to call in tonight over at our green room over at vognetwork.com slash discord if you

1304
02:01:26,340 --> 02:01:33,060
want to be a part of the show tonight. In the meantime, let's get some more news. Loki, a game

1305
02:01:33,060 --> 02:01:40,420
we were talking about earlier, right? Yes. Morio Kishimoto, who is the game director and designer

1306
02:01:40,420 --> 02:01:49,140
on Sonic Team. He has let everybody know that there's basically that the new sequel of Sonic

1307
02:01:49,140 --> 02:01:56,980
or Sonic Frontiers has areas which were not quite there yet. That's pretty obvious. It was pretty

1308
02:01:56,980 --> 02:02:04,100
empty. And that they're treating the feedback that players are leaving them right now like a

1309
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:10,020
global play test. Now that's not to be confused with we're treating the release of this game like

1310
02:02:10,020 --> 02:02:15,300
a global play test, but more like that they are taking feedback seriously because I know I read

1311
02:02:15,300 --> 02:02:20,020
it the other way the first time. I'm like, oh, how nice pay $60 for your game. And we're just going

1312
02:02:20,020 --> 02:02:24,420
to be play testing it, I guess. But I mean, that is kind of what it is in the sense that

1313
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:29,620
a lot of the stuff really should have been polished, like especially some of the pop in

1314
02:02:29,620 --> 02:02:35,940
that's in this case that a game that is about speed and the pop in is so bad that you miss

1315
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:44,660
stuff. That is a problem. Whether they're going to patch it, I don't know. Hopefully,

1316
02:02:44,660 --> 02:02:50,100
hopefully they can fix it. But at the very least, they're going to take what they've learned from

1317
02:02:50,100 --> 02:02:57,060
previous games that have performed poorly, technically, and apply that to the next game

1318
02:02:57,060 --> 02:03:00,660
that they make. And I'm sure that we won't ever have these problems again, Pokemon.

1319
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:05,860
Yeah, I was gonna say, I'm sure game freak is breathing a sigh of relief. It's not just us.

1320
02:03:08,580 --> 02:03:12,980
We're all in this together. That's that's the industry nowadays. Like it literally is

1321
02:03:12,980 --> 02:03:19,700
acceptable for them to put out broken products. Can you imagine if that were to be like any other

1322
02:03:19,700 --> 02:03:27,540
industry like cars or planes? Or movies? The movies just miss? Well, okay. But remember when

1323
02:03:27,540 --> 02:03:32,180
the Cats movie came out and like the CGI like there were pieces of it that like weren't done?

1324
02:03:33,220 --> 02:03:36,580
Yeah. So that actually I was like, Oh, actually, it does happen in movies.

1325
02:03:36,580 --> 02:03:43,780
Like they did as much as they could. So anyway, but I didn't know when I saw I didn't notice any

1326
02:03:43,780 --> 02:03:50,980
of that when I saw it finished the CG on the rest of it. So, you know. All right. Anyhow, moving on

1327
02:03:50,980 --> 02:03:56,500
to a story that was submitted via our discord because in our chat over at Orange Lounge Radio,

1328
02:03:56,500 --> 02:04:01,220
you all can send us some stories for potential inclusion in our show. And I do I do read

1329
02:04:01,220 --> 02:04:07,220
everything in our chat, even if I don't always chat. But there was a story that was posted

1330
02:04:07,220 --> 02:04:12,260
about scalper bots and the PlayStation five apparently scalper bots are starting to lose

1331
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:17,220
interest in the PlayStation five. This is according to a bot detection specialist,

1332
02:04:17,860 --> 02:04:22,260
net Asia. I don't know if I'm saying that right. But it's a quarterly index on the top five

1333
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:27,780
products that are targeted by scalper bots. And for the third quarter of 2022, the PlayStation

1334
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:33,700
five is no longer in the top three. We know where they went to number four or swift tickets.

1335
02:04:34,580 --> 02:04:38,340
No, it wasn't even because this is the third quarter. So Taylor Swift actually in the fourth

1336
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:43,300
quarter. And that's a that's a fourth. That is a whole other disaster. Can you believe?

1337
02:04:43,300 --> 02:04:50,580
Can you believe? Because like, can you believe Congress is finally going to investigate ticket

1338
02:04:50,580 --> 02:04:56,900
master? Like the government is going to and it took Taylor Swift to make that happen. Like I,

1339
02:04:56,900 --> 02:05:02,260
I don't consider myself a Swifty. But damn her power. Like I respect your music. I like some

1340
02:05:02,260 --> 02:05:09,220
of her songs. I do like I understand why people are a Swifty. But like, damn her power to like,

1341
02:05:09,220 --> 02:05:15,780
be able to shut down Ticketmaster. Break them out. Something we've been yelling about for years.

1342
02:05:15,780 --> 02:05:19,140
We'll see that actually happens. Yeah, we'll see if it actually happens. That's for sure.

1343
02:05:19,140 --> 02:05:26,260
All right. Anyhow, um, are you curious what outranked the PlayStation five? Number one,

1344
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:33,220
Adidas Yeezy slide bone. Number two, Nike Dunk Low Panda, of course, their shoes.

1345
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:40,900
Sometimes we forget, because we're kind of tunnel vision on video games. We forget the shoe industry

1346
02:05:40,900 --> 02:05:47,780
is fucking wild. Sometimes. Is there anybody out there in chat that participates in shoe collection?

1347
02:05:47,780 --> 02:05:53,220
Because I remember just a couple weeks ago, I was in San Francisco, walking around for

1348
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:56,340
something completely unrelated. I was there. Oh, it was when I went and saw Jackie Little

1349
02:05:56,340 --> 02:05:59,940
Pill with melody. And I was waiting for her to show up. And I was walking by the store. And I

1350
02:05:59,940 --> 02:06:04,740
was like, why is there a gigantic fucking line to go in this store that looks almost absolutely

1351
02:06:04,740 --> 02:06:09,380
empty shoes? It was a shoe release of some sort. And they were all going in there to get shoes.

1352
02:06:09,940 --> 02:06:17,460
And it was probably one of these, to be honest. All right. Um, let's see. And then number three,

1353
02:06:18,260 --> 02:06:24,900
Panini Donruss Optic football trading cards. What the fuck are those? Optic, is that like,

1354
02:06:25,620 --> 02:06:30,740
trading cards with NFCs built, not NFT, NFCs built in were like, you can scan them and stuff,

1355
02:06:30,740 --> 02:06:34,980
because that's where like, that's what it sounds like. It's wild.

1356
02:06:34,980 --> 02:06:37,460
I thought at first it was gonna be sandwiches. Like, damn.

1357
02:06:37,460 --> 02:06:40,500
Yeah, I know. When I saw Panini, I was like, oh, like a press like, damn,

1358
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:47,380
that must be a hell of a thing. But yeah, no, they look like just normal old football cards.

1359
02:06:47,540 --> 02:06:53,140
Interesting. Maybe somebody in chat knows more about that. But those are more desirable

1360
02:06:53,140 --> 02:06:57,700
than PlayStation five. Mike Deaf says those are popular worldwide, the Panini cards.

1361
02:06:58,580 --> 02:07:06,980
So, and the sandwiches. And in Pokemon, sandwiches are an important plot point in Pokemon.

1362
02:07:06,980 --> 02:07:12,020
That's how you get Pokemon to breed now, is through sandwiches. It is.

1363
02:07:12,980 --> 02:07:17,700
It's true, you go to the picnic. So that's right, you you set up a romantic picnic for

1364
02:07:17,700 --> 02:07:26,500
two Pokemon, and then there's eggs. No more nurseries. So there's another difference

1365
02:07:26,500 --> 02:07:33,300
from previous generations. Oh, Mike Deaf points out every World Cup they release a set. These

1366
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:38,020
are actual like the one at least the ones I googled were showing us American football,

1367
02:07:38,020 --> 02:07:41,780
but that would make a lot of sense that they might be worldwide more what we know as soccer,

1368
02:07:41,780 --> 02:07:47,380
but what the rest of the world knows as football. It might might make sense. It's more related in

1369
02:07:47,380 --> 02:07:52,660
that universe. So interesting. You know, I I'm getting to a point where I'm like, yeah, I think

1370
02:07:52,660 --> 02:07:57,540
I'd kind of like to have a PlayStation five. Maybe that'll be a holiday thing. I don't know. Alan was

1371
02:07:57,540 --> 02:08:01,380
kind of asking some probing questions around us. I don't know if that's I've seen them in stores

1372
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:06,740
now. They're not that bad. Yeah. Yeah. To get. So maybe maybe that'll be a holiday thing. I don't

1373
02:08:06,740 --> 02:08:11,140
know. But if it's not, I'm like, okay with that. Like if it's because they are still expensive.

1374
02:08:11,140 --> 02:08:15,380
So if it's something that has to wait until a little closer to June or whenever Final Fantasy

1375
02:08:15,940 --> 02:08:21,460
fifth, not 15, Final Fantasy 16 is releasing, then, you know, so be it. It's fine.

1376
02:08:22,820 --> 02:08:26,660
All right, moving on. Let's talk about what's happening in Microsoft's world, Loki.

1377
02:08:27,380 --> 02:08:32,500
They're banning people. So their digital transparency report came out,

1378
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:40,660
and apparently their automatic banning system to catch inauthentic accounts and

1379
02:08:40,740 --> 02:08:47,300
cheating accounts has banned nearly four point three three million of those accounts.

1380
02:08:47,860 --> 02:08:55,940
And they claim that ninety nine point nine nine percent of the time it automatically bans fake

1381
02:08:55,940 --> 02:09:02,100
accounts as soon as they're created and that their automation helps find resolutions sooner,

1382
02:09:03,060 --> 02:09:09,540
reduce the needs for human review and further reduce the impact of toxic content in human

1383
02:09:11,140 --> 02:09:19,380
monitors. Yeah, that's curious to see. I'm curious to see what the, you know,

1384
02:09:20,580 --> 02:09:24,420
landscape looks like in multiplayer. I haven't really played in public multiplayer games and

1385
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:33,860
it's probably coming up on a decade now, more than a decade. I don't know. So be curious to see

1386
02:09:33,860 --> 02:09:39,700
like if that's changing like the landscape or if it's still, you know, that one percent of

1387
02:09:39,700 --> 02:09:46,100
a-holes that manages to get through. Yeah. And I feel like every time you have a cheating

1388
02:09:46,100 --> 02:09:49,540
embodying ban, then they just find a new way around it. Like, you know, it's it's going to

1389
02:09:49,540 --> 02:09:54,100
be a forever game of whack-a-mole forever and ever. You know, that's what it is pretty much.

1390
02:09:54,660 --> 02:09:59,380
All right. And lastly, this is kind of an interesting story because I wasn't aware

1391
02:09:59,380 --> 02:10:03,460
that this was something that was being worked on even at some point. But this is a story about

1392
02:10:03,460 --> 02:10:13,700
SimCopter64. So SimCopter64 was a sequel to, of course, SimCopter that was being worked on for,

1393
02:10:14,340 --> 02:10:18,020
sorry, I'm trying to get some of the b-roll up here. I'm doing it a little on the fly here.

1394
02:10:18,660 --> 02:10:22,980
But for those that are watching live over at twitch.tv slash vog network as we tape

1395
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:26,900
live on Sunday night, I was just trying to get some of the video up for you. There we go.

1396
02:10:26,900 --> 02:10:34,580
So this is a version of SimCopter64 that was playable at E3 in 1997. It was going to be a

1397
02:10:34,580 --> 02:10:40,900
sequel to the original SimCopter game that was on the PC. In this title, you flew a helicopter

1398
02:10:40,900 --> 02:10:46,180
around your own SimCity. And that's what you're seeing pretty much in this Nintendo 64 version,

1399
02:10:46,180 --> 02:10:52,900
although it is really interesting to me in this footage, how they use a fog effect to like,

1400
02:10:52,900 --> 02:10:56,820
not have to render things on the entire screen. But you know, okay, all right.

1401
02:10:56,820 --> 02:11:02,900
We see what you do in fact in Nintendo 64 is pretty much is every game had a fog effect.

1402
02:11:02,900 --> 02:11:07,700
Yeah, well, maybe the new Pokemon game needed a fog effect. I don't know. But anyway,

1403
02:11:09,220 --> 02:11:14,980
anyway, this new footage was captured directly from a Nintendo 64 from the Video Game History

1404
02:11:14,980 --> 02:11:20,820
Foundation, who was able to find that E3 demo that was only ever seen in 1997. They've also written

1405
02:11:20,820 --> 02:11:26,580
a big article if you want to see it gamehistory.org is their website. Apparently, there was a lot of

1406
02:11:26,580 --> 02:11:31,620
difficulty in making a game that was fun to play and worked well on the hardware, you know, and

1407
02:11:31,620 --> 02:11:35,700
I'm joking about the fog effect. But let's be real, that was really going to annoy a lot of

1408
02:11:35,700 --> 02:11:42,820
people with that. So yeah, pretty neat that, yeah, I like seeing, you know, kind of the old stuff

1409
02:11:42,820 --> 02:11:47,460
that pops up again, and you know, this stuff that otherwise would have been lost to time.

1410
02:11:48,020 --> 02:11:52,660
But yeah, I'm sure if this had actually come out, it probably would not have been very well

1411
02:11:52,660 --> 02:11:57,140
received. But kind of neat. I didn't even really know that I didn't realize that they were even

1412
02:11:57,140 --> 02:12:03,060
working on one. I remember the original game. There were so many sim games in that era. That

1413
02:12:03,060 --> 02:12:07,860
was like that was the era of SimAnt, which I think you were playing on your background a few weeks

1414
02:12:07,860 --> 02:12:17,380
ago. SimTower, SimCopter, SimEarth, SimCity 3000, I think was probably in that same time frame.

1415
02:12:18,100 --> 02:12:22,980
There was just a ton of SimCity games that were all released at once, or sim-based games before

1416
02:12:22,980 --> 02:12:28,020
we actually got, of course, The Sims, which then, you know, pretty much transformed those games

1417
02:12:28,020 --> 02:12:35,620
forever. So Bobby Lachlvenchat says, I remember playing this at my first E3. I was totally more

1418
02:12:35,620 --> 02:12:39,940
interested in SimCity 3000. Actually, I don't think I played it. I think it was guided by an

1419
02:12:39,940 --> 02:12:45,460
employee so they wouldn't clip into buildings. But there was one TV that had this demo on it,

1420
02:12:45,460 --> 02:12:52,020
SimCity 3000 was the big thing in EA's booth that year. And SSG100 Matt throwing it back to another

1421
02:12:52,020 --> 02:12:56,900
all time classic that was released around that time, SimCity Action News Simulator,

1422
02:12:58,980 --> 02:13:05,060
which of course is a reference to the SimCity CD-ROM game that actually had cutscenes of

1423
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:11,620
SimCity Action News that would report on the disasters. It was it was like public access

1424
02:13:11,620 --> 02:13:16,980
television, community theater, absolute camp, these things. I know we've made fun of it on the

1425
02:13:16,980 --> 02:13:22,100
show before, but I'm glad that end joke is still around out there. I got to find a copy of that

1426
02:13:22,100 --> 02:13:27,140
game and stream it sometime. It has to be out there in some type of like abandoned archive or

1427
02:13:27,140 --> 02:13:35,940
something somewhere. So, all right. That's it for our scheduled news tonight. If you would, oh,

1428
02:13:35,940 --> 02:13:42,420
see, I got the cost. If you would like to call in, you can do that over at twitch, excuse me,

1429
02:13:42,420 --> 02:13:47,380
well twitch.tv slash vog network if you'd like to ask us a question. But vog network.com slash

1430
02:13:47,380 --> 02:13:51,860
discord if you'd like to actually give us a call, you can head on into our green room. I was going

1431
02:13:51,860 --> 02:13:57,540
to check the mailbag. But I don't think I remember seeing anything in there. But I'll look in there

1432
02:13:57,540 --> 02:14:03,060
right now and see. In the meantime, let me check with Loki and see if there's any last minute

1433
02:14:03,060 --> 02:14:11,700
stories. I just looked. Nothing. Nothing. Shane, is there anything else that you saw in the news

1434
02:14:11,700 --> 02:14:15,220
this week that you want to talk about that we haven't gotten to yet? No, I've been paying

1435
02:14:15,220 --> 02:14:20,180
attention because you know, Pokemon. So if it's not Pokemon related, I wouldn't know what's

1436
02:14:20,180 --> 02:14:24,180
happening. What are you are you just working on your decks in that game? Basically? Yeah.

1437
02:14:25,300 --> 02:14:32,740
That's gonna take a long time. I feel like I see. I see. All right. Anyway, let's see the usual

1438
02:14:32,740 --> 02:14:38,020
places not letting me log in. So let me see if I can find because they all go about halfway done.

1439
02:14:38,020 --> 02:14:45,380
It says I'm at 195. That's not terrible. That's actually not as many Pokemon as I was expect you

1440
02:14:45,380 --> 02:14:51,540
to have to have beaten the game. That's only caught it says I've battled like 300 something

1441
02:14:51,540 --> 02:14:57,940
different ones. So okay. Well, I'll work out how long before I get the Scarlet exclusives that you

1442
02:14:57,940 --> 02:15:01,860
want. Or did you already take care of that? No, I haven't taken care of it yet. All right. Well,

1443
02:15:01,860 --> 02:15:06,900
I'll work on it. I can't I can't promise I'll stream tonight. But maybe I'm not I'm not going

1444
02:15:06,900 --> 02:15:10,820
to do like a post show thing like dark soccer usually does because I need a minute to like

1445
02:15:10,820 --> 02:15:14,900
actually edit this show. If I do anything, it'll be late night and only for a little bit. But

1446
02:15:16,500 --> 02:15:22,660
hopefully I can get to those areas soon. So. All right. Well, I guess with that,

1447
02:15:22,660 --> 02:15:26,420
we're at the point where we're going to wrap up the show. But before we wrap up the show,

1448
02:15:26,420 --> 02:15:29,460
let's get everybody's final thoughts. Actually, that did end up being a longer show than I would

1449
02:15:29,460 --> 02:15:33,380
have thought. Because we had a lot to say, I guess. So let's go right to get everybody's

1450
02:15:33,380 --> 02:15:36,740
final thought for the night. Hey, Shane, thank you so much for being here and filling in tonight

1451
02:15:36,740 --> 02:15:41,620
and coming in to talk about Pokemon. Really appreciate that and hope you had a good time.

1452
02:15:42,580 --> 02:15:46,100
You're welcome. Thank you. Before I get your final thought, let me remind our listeners,

1453
02:15:46,100 --> 02:15:50,100
of course, as always, thank you for listening to Orange Launch Radio. If you enjoyed what you

1454
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:53,540
heard here at the show, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a

1455
02:15:53,540 --> 02:15:58,180
voice. But we need the voices here to put out on air. So tell a friend or two about the show.

1456
02:15:58,820 --> 02:16:03,460
Help us spread the word. A five-star review wherever you found this podcast on a site like

1457
02:16:03,460 --> 02:16:08,500
iTunes or Spotify goes an awful long way. So we really appreciate it. As I was saying at the

1458
02:16:08,500 --> 02:16:13,060
beginning of the show, and obviously, I was pretty emotional about a lot of things. And thank you,

1459
02:16:13,060 --> 02:16:16,580
talking about video games has been very good for my mood tonight and just being with you all.

1460
02:16:16,580 --> 02:16:22,020
But obviously, there's a real community here that we built up over the past few years,

1461
02:16:22,020 --> 02:16:24,740
and we'd love for more people to join our community. And obviously,

1462
02:16:25,380 --> 02:16:30,260
when we lose somebody from that community, and I'm not talking about somebody just deciding they

1463
02:16:30,260 --> 02:16:33,380
have something better to do on Sunday nights, but we really lose somebody from the community.

1464
02:16:33,380 --> 02:16:38,100
Obviously, it really hurts. We are a family of sorts here on Sunday nights. So just really

1465
02:16:38,100 --> 02:16:42,180
appreciate those of you that turn out. And of course, that extends to absolutely every one of

1466
02:16:42,180 --> 02:16:46,900
you that listens throughout the week on the podcast feed as well. I am well aware due to time

1467
02:16:46,900 --> 02:16:51,300
zones for many of you overseas or just due to the fact that there's a lot that goes on in the world

1468
02:16:51,380 --> 02:16:55,140
on Sunday nights. Some of you listen on the podcast feed throughout the week,

1469
02:16:55,140 --> 02:16:59,620
and that is totally cool too. You are absolutely a part of this just as much as everyone else.

1470
02:16:59,620 --> 02:17:04,900
Please make sure we hear from you once in a while, either over at our mailbag. I almost said that

1471
02:17:04,900 --> 02:17:09,620
social media site I don't use anymore. Technically, we're there, but you'll have to pay me to check

1472
02:17:09,620 --> 02:17:14,340
it. Mailbag at orange, or excuse me, participate. I don't even know our fucking email address

1473
02:17:14,340 --> 02:17:18,580
anymore. Participate at orange.radio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.

1474
02:17:18,580 --> 02:17:22,500
Okay, all of that being said, now I'll go to Shane. Shane, your final thought for us tonight?

1475
02:17:23,540 --> 02:17:29,860
Um, the new Pokemon games are really good. If you don't care about like bugs that are not game

1476
02:17:29,860 --> 02:17:34,580
breaking, please go get them. You'll have a lot of fun if you especially if you know a few other

1477
02:17:34,580 --> 02:17:38,580
people to play with and you just want to roam around in the world. It's one of the coolest

1478
02:17:39,220 --> 02:17:44,740
Pokemon experiences I've ever had. Yeah, I'm excited. I'm excited captures that same like

1479
02:17:44,740 --> 02:17:49,060
go feeling. You know, when go is new, we were all out like in downtown sack,

1480
02:17:49,060 --> 02:17:54,340
walking around, or old town sack. Like, I know you only get three other people with you and

1481
02:17:54,340 --> 02:17:58,900
you kind of got to know and you have to know who they are to be invited. But it's a lot of fun

1482
02:17:58,900 --> 02:18:04,020
still. I am excited to get to the point of that game where that feels a little more realistic,

1483
02:18:04,020 --> 02:18:07,700
realistic to do. I kind of feel like that's not something you really do until either like you've

1484
02:18:07,700 --> 02:18:11,220
beaten the game or you're really close. Like it's not something you should really do in the

1485
02:18:11,220 --> 02:18:15,700
beginning. But I mean, I guess there's no rules on it. But I just feel for me like,

1486
02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:20,180
oh, I should kind of focus on like progress and progression before I play with other players. I

1487
02:18:20,180 --> 02:18:28,500
don't know. Is that a fair outlook? Um, I think so non spoilery, the progression that should matter

1488
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:36,260
to most people, if you want to go explore everything is do the Titan battles. Those

1489
02:18:36,260 --> 02:18:42,820
are most important other things. I understand why. Yeah. Um, but yeah, no, just do what you

1490
02:18:42,820 --> 02:18:50,820
want in the game. That's what it's billed as. So don't run around with people. Just focus like I

1491
02:18:50,820 --> 02:18:56,340
did. And you'll have a great time regardless. All right. All right. Loki, your final thoughts

1492
02:18:56,340 --> 02:19:02,740
tonight. I'll simulate your three is awesome. Go play it. All right. Sounds good. And my final

1493
02:19:02,740 --> 02:19:07,060
thought tonight is, um, thank you all very much for being here. Thank you for listening.

1494
02:19:07,060 --> 02:19:12,180
I appreciate you. I hope you all had a good 20 November. I know it wasn't great in the rest of

1495
02:19:12,180 --> 02:19:19,460
the world. Um, but you know, it's, it's, it's a, it's today's date is a good symbol of community.

1496
02:19:19,460 --> 02:19:23,940
And that's what we've got here. And that's what we've got to get us through a lot of these shitty

1497
02:19:23,940 --> 02:19:27,940
things that happen in the world. Um, not just this community, but many other communities,

1498
02:19:27,940 --> 02:19:33,140
Twitch streamer communities that you have out there. Um, maybe religious affiliated communities

1499
02:19:33,140 --> 02:19:37,700
you participate with in your spare time or other community based communities, uh, you know, real

1500
02:19:37,700 --> 02:19:41,860
world, uh, in real life things or other online communities, role-playing game communities,

1501
02:19:41,860 --> 02:19:48,020
whatever it is MMOs, whatever it is, uh, 20 November is definitely a symbol of a community
