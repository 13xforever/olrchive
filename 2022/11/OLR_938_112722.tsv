0	14000	It may be true that 2D Mario games outsell 3D Mario games, but the same is not true of
14000	17360	Pokemon, as Scarlet and Violet reach 10 million units sold in three days.
17360	20920	It's not all gold and silver, as many gamers have taken up swords and shields to decry
20920	22320	the quality of their beloved game.
22320	25640	They're ready to rumble in the stadium before going home to probably play more.
25640	27440	That's the cycle of the sun and moon.
27440	28440	Legends.
28440	29760	This is the punniest intro I've done.
29760	33240	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about
33240	36160	this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where every
36160	38160	gamer has a voice.
38160	43640	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
43640	48000	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
48000	56960	It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again for tonight, November the 27th of 2022, episode
56960	59700	number 938 of our show.
59700	64340	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you every week with my co-hosts, well, not
64340	66920	here this week, Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers.
66920	69600	She has the night off as we talked about last week.
69600	73180	She went on a trip for the holidays to go see her mom, who she's talked a lot about
73180	74180	on the show recently.
74180	76960	My understanding is she actually did get back last night.
76960	80820	She just kind of wanted to take tonight off to sort of recover, which I can completely
80820	81820	understand.
81820	86660	I know when I go on a big trip, I need a vacation for my vacation, so she's just going to continue
86660	87660	the night off.
87660	91700	She's going to be joining us again next week back on the program.
91700	95700	Instead, of course, we have, as we have every week, Techmaster Loki.
95700	96700	Hello.
96700	97700	Hi, how are you?
97700	98700	I'm good.
98700	99700	Good, good.
99700	103260	And no third host tonight.
103260	108140	I was out of town myself because with the Thanksgiving holiday in the States, I was
108140	111140	gone for a couple of days because I went to a Friendsgiving.
111140	115340	For those of you that remember the show, Hoard House, my pal, Grandpa, has a murder cabin
115340	116340	up in the woods.
116340	123180	I call it murder cabin because it's a very remote part of the rural California, but it
123180	124180	was great.
124180	125660	We had a nice Friendsgiving celebration.
125660	127980	It was lovely.
127980	132580	But kept me out of town for a couple of days, so I wasn't really thinking about, oh, who
132580	135180	should sit in on OLR this week?
135180	139740	It's just Loki and I holding down the fort tonight with all of you in our chat over at
139740	147440	twitch.tv slash vog network or VOG network because we do tape live every Sunday night
147440	152300	at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the
152300	157340	Voice of Geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network.
157340	162100	And some folks tonight in chat talking about our little parody bump that opened the show
162100	167980	tonight, which was a riff on Atari 50 and She-Hulk 10 in chat is saying, woohoo, Atari
167980	171500	2600 is the best console ever made.
171500	173260	It certainly is the heaviest.
173260	176460	It certainly is the one that you probably could use in a murder cabin.
176460	183040	No, I obviously I would never endorse that, but Atari 2600 obviously without it, we wouldn't
183040	185580	have a lot of games that we have today.
185580	186580	That's for sure.
186580	191500	Atari 2600 is a legendary console and really one of the first that I remember playing.
192020	198660	SH-100 Matt is noting in chat the video game that is playing behind Loki tonight is Festers
198660	206360	Quest from the Super Nintendo, Nintendo era, which fun fact, Festers Quest in many ways
206360	208640	is Blaster Master 2.
208640	214620	They very much run on the same engine, except Festers Quest is only the overhead sequences
214620	218040	from Blaster Master does not have any of the side scroller and the vampart.
218040	221820	But if you were to take all of the overhead sequences and make a game out of it, you basically
221820	223660	get Festers Quest on the NES.
223660	224660	And some people loved it.
224660	225660	Some people hated it.
225660	229860	And it also, it cracks me up because it's like a lot of the same mechanics, the gun
229860	231180	increasing levels.
231180	235320	Even those little frogs are the same fricking sprites from Blaster Master.
235320	240000	So Festers Quest, like I don't know how Festers Quest and Blaster Master got set in the same
240000	241560	universe, but they very much are.
241560	244680	I just want to point that out.
244680	246520	Were you a fan of Festers Quest back in the day?
247000	248000	Yeah, it was all right.
248000	252200	Yeah, I remember reading a lot of like the walkthroughs in Nintendo Power and stuff like
252200	253200	that.
253200	254200	Yeah.
254200	259220	I got a copy of Festers Quest for Christmas one time.
259220	263480	And it was a Christmas gift I spoiled for myself because my mom had gone to the store.
263480	265320	I don't remember what store she went to.
265320	267160	Some store that doesn't exist anymore.
267160	269920	Probably I want to say it was like KB Toys or something like that.
269920	274700	She went to and there was a bag or she went to the store next to KB Toys, but there was
274700	276200	a shopping bag.
276760	279400	Sometimes I'll be like, oh, what did mom get at the grocery store?
279400	281160	And I look and there's a KB Toys bag in there.
281160	282160	I'm like, oh, why did you go to KB Toys?
282160	283160	And I open it.
283160	285060	There's a copy of Festers Quest in there.
285060	287760	And I put two and two together and I was like, oh shit, that was my Christmas present.
287760	292660	I just saw like, even at the age of like 10, I was like, oops, I wasn't supposed to see
292660	293660	this.
293660	297760	So I put it back and just walked out of the room and pretended I didn't see nothing.
297760	300400	And then on Christmas Day, I act surprised and thankful.
300400	302800	And it's not like I have to play the game early.
302800	304320	I just saw the box sitting there.
304320	307600	So that's, uh, that's my Festers Quest story.
307600	311040	Dardusia says, I know I rented Festers Quest a time or two.
311040	312040	Yeah.
312040	315080	I think everybody, everybody that was gaming in that area had to have played it at some
315080	316080	point.
316080	317080	I'm sure.
317080	318080	Digirama S says it was pretty good.
318080	319080	I enjoyed Festers Quest.
319080	323540	I think I wouldn't say it's like an all time greatest NES game, but I think people give
323540	326160	it more shit than they need to.
326160	331400	And I think when you realize that this game is Blaster Master 2, you kind of go, oh, should
331400	333440	I be talking so much shit about this game?
333560	337160	And this game is probably better than the actual Blaster Master 2 that they put out
337160	340560	on the Genesis years later.
340560	341560	So there is that.
341560	342560	All right.
342560	346560	From the 3D Blaster Master game that they put out on, was it the original PlayStation
346560	347560	or something like that?
347560	348560	Oh yeah.
348560	350440	There was a, or 3D Blaster Master on the original PlayStation.
350440	357320	Then they did a reboot on the Nintendo Wii that was okay, but the physics were off and
357320	359760	you can't have the physics be off in a Blaster Master game.
359760	363640	They have to, they have to feel like the original or the whole game is thrown off.
363640	365400	That was my big problem with it.
365400	368920	But the other, and I know I've mentioned this on the show, but I'll say it again.
368920	374080	The recent Blaster Master Zero reimagining, because they kind of, they didn't really totally
374080	375080	remake it.
375080	376120	They really redid some things.
376120	381400	The Blaster Master Zero, I think is one of the most well done remasters, reimagines,
381400	385880	whatever you want to call it, that they've done of any game of the NES era, to be quite
385880	387720	frankly.
387720	389520	That is probably one of the best.
389520	393160	And they ended up making a whole trilogy out of that, which Blaster Master two and
393160	397500	three, or Blaster Master Zero two and three, I don't think have anything to do with the
397500	404280	original series at all, except they made a character in those games out of a character
404280	407340	that was only in the FX9 books.
407340	411400	The worlds of power books that were based off of NES games from back in the day.
411400	416560	So random, useless, fun fact if you're ever on Jeopardy someday.
416560	417560	Being in chat.
417560	420520	Yeah, Dr. Sia says there's only the Blaster Master Zero trilogy.
420520	423120	Yeah, I would I would actually super recommend that.
423120	427800	SHO 100 Matt says yeah, the AVGN video gave it kind of a bad rap.
427800	433000	I think too many people take that person's opinions and slap like if that guy says this
433000	436440	game is bad, hahaha, then they agree this game is bad.
436440	442160	When it's like I, you know, I'm not going to defend that this is an all time great,
442160	444420	but I think it's better than people give it credit for.
444420	445420	And that's the case.
445420	448060	I'm just gonna say it with a lot of those videos because another one another one I think
448060	452060	it's a lot of shit unnecessarily is the Friday the 13th video game.
452060	453060	Is it?
453060	454060	Is it great?
454060	455060	No, it does.
455060	458660	It has an amazing soundtrack as an incredible soundtrack.
458660	462220	And I like that Jason looks all neon and funky.
462220	465540	Keep in mind that game came out around the time they were making movies like Jason in
465540	466540	space.
466540	470880	I'm sorry, but the Jason in that game is just fine for where the franchise was out at that
470880	471880	time.
471880	475720	And you know, the the character balance is extremely lopsided and there's there's other
475720	476960	issues of that game.
476960	481360	But I don't think Friday the 13th is nearly as bad as people give the rap on that game.
481360	483760	So that's my thought.
483760	487280	And of course, you know, I have a copy.
487280	491960	Well not Fester's Quest, but I have a copy of nice blaster master nice right here on
491960	493480	my computer because perfect.
493480	495340	That's where I store my NES games apparently.
495340	499400	Now that is a game I will defend as an all time great blaster master was extremely underrated
499400	500400	at the time.
500400	501400	And it's an incredible game.
501400	502400	Start to finish.
502400	503400	Yeah.
503400	504400	All right.
504400	507040	Well, we could talk about, you know, the old men could sit here and talk about NES games
507040	510760	all night, but we should probably talk about what else is going on in the industry.
510760	515040	Let's get to our kickoff topic tonight, which has to do with, you know, ever since this
515040	519640	Microsoft and Activision Blizzard merger was announced, we knew this was going to go through
519640	521560	a lot of legal scrutiny.
521560	528840	And we're getting a lot more information that's coming out of statements, filings, Sony's
528840	536720	rebuttal, Microsoft's defense, like this, this is really the what do you call those
536720	539880	agreements?
539880	541080	The name escapes me in the moment.
541080	542760	Of course, now I'm trying to think of it.
542760	543760	Non-disclosure.
543760	544760	Thank you.
544760	549200	This is really the NDA gift that keeps on giving is this whole little merger.
549200	553480	So let's talk about some of the things that came out as a result of this this week, Loki.
553480	556680	It's basically say anything is what it is.
556680	562800	They're just saying whatever they can to try to persuade the government bodies that are
562800	566540	looking at this to persuade them, obviously, one way or the other.
566540	573960	So you have things like where Xbox, you know, Microsoft and the Xbox team are saying, well,
573960	578640	you know, PlayStation exclusives are better than our, you know, exclusive games.
578640	584920	And so it's it's fine that we get, you know, Call of Duty as an exclusive game because,
584920	589680	you know, they have their exclusive games and those are better.
589680	596280	That's one argument that they're making and with the CMA in UK.
596280	599960	That argument should be thrown out of court with with a copy of Forza Horizon, any of
599960	600960	them on top.
600960	605240	Well, then also they're saying, you know, Nintendo also has better quality exclusives
605240	607560	as well that outsell their own first party games.
607560	612040	And maybe, you know, maybe that is true to a certain extent.
612040	613640	I don't know.
613680	616720	And Sony, that's all opinions, Sony.
616720	622200	You know, the argument is saying, well, hey, you're not like losing out on all of the first
622200	623200	person shooter franchises.
623200	627480	I mean, you have Battlefield, Battlefield is a great first person franchise.
627480	632840	And so he's like, no, no, it's not.
632840	635280	It is not as good as Call of Duty.
635280	636640	And so that's kind of funny.
636640	639980	They're saying, you know, Call of Duty is not replaceable.
639980	641800	You could always bring back resistance.
641800	643560	Sony, you feel that strongly about it.
643560	644560	Why don't you bring back resistance?
644560	646880	I would be for that for sure.
646880	647880	I love resistance.
647880	650520	That game was awesome.
650520	654760	Really they should bring that back or even like Killzone would be fine.
654760	659280	Bring that back to I mean, there's franchises that they have or I mean, gosh, they have
659280	660760	a ton of franchises.
660760	663180	There's mag that they stopped doing stuff with.
663180	664180	So calm.
664180	670760	I mean, so many franchises that could be a big like first person shooter, Call of Duty
670760	673620	type game that they've just kind of dumped on.
673620	679780	But they also that something somehow came out of this that Sony has confirmed that the
679780	689040	release date of the PlayStation six is going to be somewhere around 2028, 2027.
689040	692960	So so much for the days of when they were saying that the PlayStation three was a 10
692960	693960	year life cycle.
693960	697460	Well, I think they've just.
697460	698460	They do this all the time.
698460	701940	The 10 year life cycle doesn't mean that the next console can't come out and the life
701940	703420	cycle, the old one continues.
703420	705380	I think I think that's where they're going with it.
705380	709660	I think a lot of I'm trying to remember when did the PlayStation three come out 2006.
709660	710660	Right.
710660	712060	And then when did the PlayStation four come out?
712060	713700	Was it 2012 or 2013?
713700	716820	Well, no, actually, I think the PlayStation.
716820	723660	Yeah, it was 2006 and PlayStation four was.
723660	724660	I think it was.
724660	725660	Hmm.
725660	729100	I'm going to have to fact check myself.
729100	730100	It was 2013.
730100	731100	13.
731100	732100	Yeah.
732100	734100	Because I remember I picked it up a year later.
734100	738820	OK, so honestly, then that is so 2013.
738820	739820	Here's the deal.
739820	741220	So 2006 place.
741220	743460	Actually, let's let's go all the way.
743460	744460	Holy fuck.
744460	745660	I believe the math works out.
745660	747620	When did the original PlayStation come out?
747620	750140	I think 97.
750140	753580	No, I'm looking 94 in Japan.
753580	756140	It was 95 here, but 94 in Japan.
756140	757140	OK.
757140	758140	Add seven.
758140	760060	I didn't get until here we go.
760060	761060	Sony.
761060	762060	This news should not be news.
762060	763060	Here's why.
763060	765700	Sony PlayStation one out in Japan.
765700	767420	December 1994.
767420	768580	Add seven years.
768580	770500	Now it's 2001.
770500	772540	That's when the PlayStation two came out.
772540	773540	Add seven years.
773540	777700	OK, wait, I guess that one doesn't work because that's no way when did PlayStation two come
777700	778700	out?
778700	780820	It was 2000, 2000 or 2001.
780820	782860	It was after 2000.
782860	784420	I think it was in Japan early, though.
784420	785420	It was.
785420	786420	It was in Japan early.
786420	787420	So it's 2000.
787420	788420	So I take it back.
788420	789420	Sorry.
789420	790420	I need to get my year straight.
790420	791420	OK, so six years.
791420	801620	So 1994 to 2006 years, then 2000 to 2006, six years, then 2006 to 2013 when the PlayStation
801620	808100	four came out, seven years, then 2013 to 2020, seven years.
808100	814920	So Sony has literally always been on a six or seven year life cycle.
814920	820100	So the news that the PlayStation six is coming in 2027 really shouldn't surprise you because
820100	822980	the PlayStation five was out in 2020.
822980	824820	However.
824820	827820	I have seen where people are like, this feels like it's too soon.
827820	832020	I can't even get my hands on a PlayStation five still, but about about and that's the
832020	838820	thing that's different is that only the PlayStation five came out in a pandemic.
838820	843580	And the PlayStation five had such these severe supply chain shortages that, you know, here
843580	845500	we are in 2022.
845500	849700	And only just now are these things kind of findable pretty easy.
849700	854020	My understanding is if you sign up to get one on the PlayStation first hand store, whatever
854020	856680	you're you're going to get one sooner rather than later.
856680	860300	So these are not extraordinarily difficult to get anymore.
860300	866580	But again, the whole can you just walk into Target and buy one sometimes depends on where
866580	867980	you live.
867980	871000	So that's that's where that's at.
871000	876200	And I think that's why so so it doesn't feel like the PlayStation five launched in 2020.
876200	879220	It feels like it's just now launching in 2022.
879220	883100	So that's why it still feels kind of early, I think for the PlayStation six.
883100	888140	But otherwise, the PS six being in 2027 is right on schedule.
888140	893740	Yeah, I guess I'm not not too shocked.
893740	895380	And all that stuff can change anyways.
895380	896380	And who cares?
896380	900740	Yeah, we always know that they're working on the next big console.
900740	909180	Um, also, apparently, it Well, I don't know who's political is reporting that according
909180	914020	to three people knowledge of the matter, that the FTC is likely to file an antitrust lawsuit
914020	918880	against Microsoft to block the takeover of Activision.
918880	924620	Of course, then Activision has come out and said, you know, that's just ridiculous.
924620	927780	It's completely absurd.
927780	930900	So I guess we'll see what happens.
930900	934960	You know, predictions are all over the place.
934960	943420	I mean, honestly, I'd be very surprised like if they do, like file an antitrust lawsuit
943420	947260	against, you know, Microsoft, because I mean, they've let other mergers, especially in the
947260	952260	entertainment space, go through that have been even more toxic than this up discovery.
952260	958740	And, you know, um, so like, why this like, why Oh, but we're putting our foot down with
958740	960060	these games.
960060	965920	You know, I think some politicians want to want to put on their resume that they nailed
965920	967900	Activision Blizzard.
967900	970700	But like, yeah, but they can do that after the fall.
970700	974780	And when in fact, as far as those issues are concerned, this merger is actually a good thing
974780	979500	because there will be no place for Bobby Kotick in this future organization.
979500	982880	And Phil Spencer is a more competent leader than anyone at the top of Activision.
982880	988280	So like this in that department, it's you can tell the politicians don't follow the gaming
988280	989360	industry.
989360	994060	Because like this merger would actually be a good thing for all of those things.
994060	996620	Some of them are super elderly.
996620	997620	It's like ridiculous.
997620	999180	Yeah, I don't know.
999180	1000180	I'm not surprised.
1000180	1001180	I'm surprised.
1001180	1006740	Yeah, we always used to get those like soundbites if they're like antiquated, like takes of
1006740	1011200	stuff like, you know, well, I remember playing Pac Man and stuff like that.
1011200	1012480	Now we're those people.
1012480	1015420	So I don't know.
1015420	1020740	Well, a very, very interesting thing is happening in Congress like just today.
1020740	1023140	Because you know, Nancy Pelosi is retiring.
1023140	1027780	And there's been a lot of talk about, you know, a new class kind of coming up to take
1027780	1028780	her place.
1028780	1033820	It was announced today that three younger when I say younger, I mean 30s 40s 50s politicians
1033820	1038180	are going to be kind of coming up in the ranks behind them.
1038180	1040780	Obviously though, the Democrats are not going to be in charge of the house next year, I'm
1040780	1043260	not going to get into all those complex politics right now.
1043260	1049220	But it's just one of those you do see that politicians are finally starting to hand the
1049220	1054060	torch over to a newer generation that's probably going to be more in tune with some of this
1054060	1055060	stuff.
1055060	1056060	So that will be interesting.
1056060	1062940	So, um, Bobby Blackwell says they did block a major book publisher deal random house when
1062940	1066580	it emerged with Simon and Schuster and the feds block that I do remember when that was
1066580	1067580	going on.
1067580	1069860	They know what books are, um, sj 100.
1069860	1074580	Matt does point out even if they block the merger, Microsoft can still do other things
1074580	1080300	to make it not an antitrust issue like splitting off Xbox from Microsoft, or selling assets
1080300	1082300	to make it not an antitrust issue.
1082300	1085500	I don't see them splitting off Xbox, that would be wild.
1085500	1090940	But I could see them cut off three, four, three, I could see them cutting king out of
1090940	1091940	it.
1091940	1092940	Actually, I don't know.
1092940	1094120	I think that's the easy answer.
1094120	1099420	But I actually am like Microsoft in the mobile game making space actually is probably more
1099420	1104860	desirable than maybe even some of the components of Activision to be quite honest.
1104860	1110940	So it'll it'll really come down to what are the parts of the merger that you know, the
1110940	1113980	government really has a problem with and go from there.
1113980	1119540	But I think that the answer to a lot of Sony's arguments is Nintendo.
1119540	1121820	Like Nintendo is still a factor in the room.
1121820	1126740	As far as we know, Nintendo and Microsoft do not have any publishing agreements together.
1126740	1131800	And so Nintendo still continues to be the top selling console and have some of the top
1131800	1134520	selling video games in the entire industry.
1134520	1138820	So it's weird to me that this isn't Microsoft and Nintendo merging.
1138820	1140940	It's Microsoft and Activision Blizzard merging.
1140940	1145460	I just think it's real rich from Sony that like literally the tactics that they do now
1145460	1146980	Microsoft is doing the same thing.
1146980	1148360	They're like, Whoa, hold on.
1148360	1149360	This is not okay.
1149360	1153200	You're like, it's it's literally what you're doing.
1153200	1157940	Like you do this stuff all the time with paid exclusives and, and like paid content for
1157940	1158940	your service.
1158940	1160580	Like, I'm sorry.
1160580	1165900	This is exactly now you're now you're, you know, complaining because it's fair.
1165900	1166900	Poor baby.
1166900	1169260	Oh, no.
1169420	1173180	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says they could sell Call of Duty to Tencent and that would fix
1173180	1177220	it because really the issue is over Call of Duty so sell Call of Duty to Tencent and call
1177220	1178220	it a day.
1178220	1180020	God, I hope they don't sell it to Tencent.
1180020	1182060	You want to talk about companies that are getting too big.
1182060	1184460	Like that's that's a perfect example.
1184460	1186700	I don't know who they'll I am.
1186700	1192300	I would think you spin off that whole studio that makes Call of Duty into an independent
1192300	1195500	studio and they they own the Call of Duty IP.
1195500	1196500	And that's that.
1196500	1199380	But then this then Sony comes in and buys them watch.
1199380	1205740	Yeah, they would they would absolutely would that because they would and it would be all
1205740	1206740	sudden fine.
1206740	1210420	Because I you know, I'm sure they want to go sell it to Square Enix.
1210420	1214140	Well, there is all these rumors about Sony wanting to get with Square Enix and why Square
1214140	1216420	Enix just unloaded a bunch of their studios.
1216420	1223340	Lutely no ethics in corporate, you know, procedure like they will just do whatever they want
1223340	1225020	to stay on top.
1225020	1226020	So like, yeah, absolutely.
1226020	1230180	If they were to spin it off in their own independent company, they would absolutely move in and
1230180	1231180	try to buy it.
1231180	1232180	Yeah.
1232180	1237780	I honestly and Bobby says every Activision studio makes a Call of Duty at Toys a Bob
1237780	1238820	works on Call of Duty.
1238820	1240980	They canceled a Skylanders game to work on Call of Duty.
1240980	1243700	Yeah, no, that is that is true.
1243700	1248620	I think I think I think the most fascinating part of the deal, if it went this way, would
1248620	1251780	be what if they just spin off Activision and only by Blizzard King?
1251780	1258540	I think I as a gamer, that's the part that would make me most happy, honestly, let Activision
1258540	1261220	kind of do its own thing.
1261220	1265040	And again, I don't want to see Bobby Cody in the industry, but I would love to see Blizzard
1265040	1268860	and King just go under Microsoft and let Microsoft do what they're going to do with the Blizzard
1268860	1269860	franchises.
1269860	1270860	I think that would be a great thing.
1270860	1273860	I think the gamers would stand to win a lot in that scenario.
1273860	1276420	I mean, that's assuming Microsoft wants that.
1276420	1280260	But you know, the point was brought up earlier, it really is about Call of Duty.
1280660	1284180	World of Warcraft these days don't make the numbers that Call of Duty does.
1284180	1288820	Overwatch, while it had a big launch, we still don't know about the sustainability of it.
1288820	1290900	Diablo 4, too early to tell.
1290900	1293080	So you know, we'll, we'll see.
1293080	1295300	There's a lot more to come on that.
1295300	1299460	So all right, let's move on.
1299460	1303700	Before we get to our gaming weeks, I want to tell a little bit of a side story.
1303700	1307600	So I was going to bring this up last week, but I kind of talked about last week on the
1307600	1308600	show.
1308600	1312480	I had a lot of feelings and I was not in a great mental place last week.
1312480	1314280	I'm doing much better this week.
1314280	1315280	Thank you.
1315280	1319080	And yeah, thank you for letting me have my space on last week's show.
1319080	1322680	But because I was in a weird headspace, I didn't want to talk about this trip yet that
1322680	1324880	I had taken.
1324880	1327980	But now that I'm doing much better tonight, not that everything has been magically fixed,
1327980	1330160	I want to make sure that's very clear.
1330160	1334320	Not that everything has been magically fixed, but I'm in a better headspace than I was last
1334320	1335320	week.
1335320	1342080	And that's what it's all about for being able to prepare certain segments and so forth.
1342080	1349100	But two weeks ago, so we didn't have a show two weeks ago because I was out of town.
1349100	1354080	I was up in Seattle and I didn't say this in advance because I didn't know if it would
1354080	1355080	happen for sure.
1355080	1360960	And I don't like to talk things up unless I know I'm there and everything happened.
1360960	1367680	But I have a friend that I've known for a long time that actually a few months ago,
1367680	1372400	maybe a year ago, the pandemic has completely warped my sense of time, so I apologize, but
1372400	1375880	started working at the Pokemon Company International.
1375880	1379440	And they are actually headquartered out in the Seattle area.
1379440	1381720	So they're actually headquartered in Bellevue.
1381720	1386680	And something really cool that I got to do a couple weeks ago was I actually got to take
1386680	1389440	a little tour of the office.
1389440	1395040	Now, before you all make up your own narratives about what went on here, because this actually
1395040	1398880	would have been the week before Gen 9 came out.
1398880	1401800	No, I did not get to see Gen 9 early.
1401800	1406040	No, I did not see any work or any in progress things.
1406040	1410240	No, I don't know any secrets or things like that.
1410240	1415280	I got to tour an office building where people work and I didn't even get to see the cubes.
1415280	1421760	Okay, I only got to see the common spaces that were available, but part of the reason
1421760	1426640	why I share this with you all is that, especially for being a gamer, especially a gamer that
1426640	1431080	really enjoys Pokemon, these were some really cool offices to be able to see.
1431080	1435960	And this is also, it's not something that's open to the public.
1435960	1438880	You can't just say, I want to go get a tour of the office.
1438880	1441160	You can't exactly do that.
1441160	1446000	I happen to know somebody that was able to make this happen.
1446000	1449080	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, offices don't exist anymore anyway.
1449080	1451240	We all work from home.
1451240	1455200	You'll notice though, there's going to be some things here I'm going to show and I will
1455200	1456600	talk through this on the podcast.
1456600	1457600	I apologize.
1457600	1460480	I don't have the videos on the podcast, but you can always check the archives over at
1460480	1466200	twitch.tv slash a vog network where archives are accessible to subscribers over at twitch.tv
1466200	1467880	slash vog network.
1468480	1471640	Yeah, and Mike Deft also brings up a very good point.
1471640	1475880	These offices don't handle development itself, marketing and stuff like that.
1475880	1480880	While I am not privy to exactly what does and does not go on at this office, the sheer
1480880	1486820	amount of conference rooms that I saw in this place tell me that there's a lot of meetings,
1486820	1492600	be it clients, be it probably, you know, Japan, be it the fact that Nintendo is just located
1492600	1495000	down the road in Redmond, and so on and so on.
1495000	1499040	There's a lot of that stuff that goes on in these offices, absolutely.
1499040	1503360	So anyway, so yeah, and many folks are noticing in the lobby where I took this picture because
1503360	1505520	we had to get, you know, little special security stickers.
1505520	1509440	We also went in there on a Saturday, which was nice because it was really, really like
1509440	1511580	not bustling with people.
1511580	1513400	And I didn't want to feel like I was getting in the way.
1513400	1516280	I didn't want to have that imposter syndrome.
1516280	1519880	So it was actually really awesome being there on a Saturday where very, very few people
1519880	1520880	were there.
1520880	1522800	But we still had to get badged and all that good stuff to get in and see the stuff.
1522800	1527360	So yes, they have a little Detective Pikachu that sits in the front that is really cool.
1527360	1531560	So moving on and showing you some of the other things that we got to see there.
1531560	1536480	So this is also in the lobby where they actually have these really cool like vinyl figures,
1536480	1544000	life size of Pikachu, Squirtle, Charmander, Bulbasaur, right, the Gen 1 collection.
1544000	1551440	So yeah, DJ Rama S in chat says, friend of mine works for the Pokemon Company International.
1551440	1554200	He flies all over the country to help a localization of the anime.
1554200	1557760	Yeah, don't forget Pokemon is also much more than the games and you're going to see this
1557760	1558760	in a minute.
1558760	1560600	E3VL says, are they to scale?
1560600	1563020	I feel like they're actually bigger than scale.
1563020	1565800	But for the most part, yeah, I would say actually, yes, they are.
1565800	1568640	They are to scale because they were very big.
1568640	1573080	I'm not sure the picture that you see on stream really carries itself well, but these are
1573080	1576600	very large vinyl figures, which obviously it was very photogenic.
1576600	1580760	I also want to point out if you notice in the background of these photos, you can see
1580760	1584240	that we're very high up in a building.
1584240	1586540	Here's the interesting thing about where these offices are.
1586540	1589720	The first three floors of this building in Bellevue are a mall.
1589720	1593860	In fact, if you live in the Seattle area, you've probably been to this mall and didn't
1593860	1598040	even frickin realize that the Pokemon Company was in this building because I had been to
1598040	1600200	this mall in Bellevue.
1600200	1603720	There's a legendary dumpling place in this mall and I'm telling you, if you're in the
1603720	1606260	Seattle area, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
1606260	1610260	There's a legendary dumpling place in this mall that I went to with friends like six
1610260	1613420	years ago.
1613420	1616380	Going back on this trip gave me the weirdest deja vu.
1616380	1619780	So yeah, we're way up on the 25th, 26th, sorry.
1619780	1622340	I don't remember exactly what floor it's on.
1622340	1626020	I'm sure the back of video game manuals would tell you what floor it's on.
1626020	1630100	It's not like it's a super secret, but it's probably not something I should be sitting
1630100	1634220	here yapping about on air anyway.
1634220	1635220	Moving on.
1635220	1636220	Let's see.
1636220	1637220	Okay, I got to actually click to the next slide.
1637220	1638220	Fine.
1638220	1639260	Okay, I like this.
1639260	1642580	It's maybe a little hard to see on stream, but what I want to point out, I saw this is
1642580	1643580	cool.
1643580	1646860	This is like a common space where people can work and you get a really good sense of the
1646860	1650620	view in the back and you can actually see like downtown Seattle back there.
1650620	1655860	But they actually have this clear wall and on this clear wall, they have vinyl stickers
1655860	1659860	of the original sprites for all 151 original Pokemon.
1659860	1662260	And so that's what you actually see on the wall and it's in Pokedex order.
1662260	1667260	So you look at the upper left, you see Bulbasaur, Venusaur, so on and so on, or excuse me, Bulbasaur,
1667260	1672020	Ivysaur, Venusaur, sorry, Pokemon fans, and moving on through and all that good stuff.
1672020	1676940	So I thought this was a really cool little collection of little like vinyl sticker things
1676940	1678860	that were on this.
1678860	1681980	This I thought was one of the coolest rooms in the whole place.
1681980	1684260	And what we're looking at here, this is actually like a break room, right?
1684260	1687780	You can probably tell like, oh, it's like a, you know, they can see a little coffee
1687780	1691820	machine in there and stuff and counters and all that stuff.
1691820	1696420	The really cool thing about this is in the back where these diner style booths are that
1696420	1699300	you can sit and chat and have lunch together and so forth.
1699300	1706420	They actually have artwork of the Pokemon centers, but they're made in those tiles that
1706420	1710460	you see like in kitchens and diners, those little square tiles.
1710460	1712220	It makes up the pixel art.
1712220	1718820	And so it's actually pixel art of the Pokemon centers from every generation of Pokemon that
1718820	1724780	was pixelized that you can see the hall keeps going where my picture taking didn't go, but
1724780	1726380	they're all there in the area.
1726380	1730260	So, but I just thought this was a really cool little room and I was like, I want to take
1730260	1731260	my lunches here.
1731260	1732580	This is really cool.
1732580	1739260	So yeah, and bonds 006 says this looks like a few corporate or company office space I've
1739260	1740260	worked or been in.
1740260	1741260	Yeah.
1741260	1743500	At the end of the day, y'all it's an office space.
1743500	1746940	This was not, you know, like a play a demo space again.
1746940	1748840	That's not what I was there to do.
1748840	1752940	But it's a really like when I saw this, I was like, I want to work in this office space.
1752940	1755700	I'd go into the office more often if my office looked like this.
1755700	1756700	That's for sure.
1756700	1757700	All right.
1757700	1760760	This is one of the meeting rooms featuring one of my favorite Pokemon.
1760760	1766740	So this is actually is like a Pokemon that is, you'll notice the way it's kind of done
1766740	1771660	is that when the doors are closed, you actually can't really see into the meeting room.
1771660	1774340	And I'm sure there's a very good intent behind that.
1774340	1777880	And all of the meeting rooms, they're actually named after Pokemon.
1777880	1780580	So this one was the Lucario meeting room was one of my favorites.
1780580	1784780	You can actually see they actually have the artwork on the little reservation room and
1784780	1789060	you can actually see like, oh, yeah, this one, I believe on the other.
1789060	1791220	So Bobby Black Wolf notes that there's a rope.
1791220	1792820	The rope wasn't for the conference room.
1792820	1796260	I believe there was some type of large figurine there.
1796260	1797260	You can see it.
1797260	1801620	Look in the reflection of the office, and I'm not sure how it's coming over over stream.
1801620	1806780	But if you actually notice there in the reflection, you can see there are some large vinyl figures
1806780	1808460	that are on the other side of those ropes.
1808460	1810520	And that's what's actually roped off.
1810520	1813020	They probably just don't want people reaching over and touching them and getting their germs
1813020	1816840	on them, which is weird because this isn't exactly a public space.
1816840	1820800	The other thing again, you have to look really, really carefully in the reflection, you probably
1820800	1823740	notice a grid of things behind the Lucario.
1823740	1827520	It's because and you'll notice my reflection, they're taking the picture, which I didn't
1827520	1828900	realize, but that's right.
1828900	1832320	They actually have a trading card collection in the back there.
1832320	1838000	They have framed trading cards of I believe it is again, the pokey decks, but this time
1838000	1839920	it goes all the way through.
1839920	1846680	It's like eight or nine of these things hung up with a Pokemon trading card game card for
1846680	1850400	every one of the Pokemon in the deck starting from one.
1850400	1851400	So that yeah.
1851400	1853560	And Bobby says that's the national decks pretty much.
1853560	1854560	Yeah.
1854560	1860640	But again, nothing Gen 9 was in there as it because we were in that awkward phase where
1860640	1865600	I was like, we all know the Gen 9 Pokemon because those leaks started.
1865600	1870120	But it's like, but officially we can't talk about that yet because the game hasn't launched.
1870120	1876360	So there's no Gen 9 stuff in the space, but I think it might be the next picture actually.
1876360	1877360	Yes.
1877360	1881560	The wall of plushies that actually shows, I don't know if this is like every plushie
1881560	1885240	that's been released, but I'll be darned if it doesn't feel like every plushie that's
1885240	1887120	been released that was in this wall.
1887120	1894160	There are no Gen 9, but my understanding was those were incoming pretty soon.
1894200	1896400	So when Gen 9 officially launched.
1896400	1899140	So yeah, but this was pretty cool.
1899140	1904800	This plushie wall, it had, I noticed the ditto versions of plushies.
1904800	1908320	There's a whole section of those and yeah, plushie, plushie heaven.
1908320	1912880	Honestly, it just looks like Shane's bedroom to be honest, except with not enough oshawots,
1912880	1915200	but otherwise there were lots of cool little plushies.
1915200	1920160	And yeah, they did have Pokemon Legends Arceus themed stuff in there, which was pretty cool.
1920160	1922200	So I liked the plushie wall.
1922200	1924080	It's hard to not like the plushie wall.
1924720	1929120	This room is another kind of break area and I thought this was really cool.
1929120	1933840	And it also shows that again, the Pokemon Company is about much more than just games
1933840	1940000	because they actually had a whole reading library, which features, as I understand it,
1940000	1944080	every Pokemon related book that's ever come out was in this room.
1945280	1949360	Even foreign language ones were in the back because I was looking at some that were in
1949360	1950560	French and so forth.
1950560	1954960	And I did look for the book, Come Out Squirtle, and it was there.
1954960	1960720	In fact, there was a whole series in that, which was pretty cool.
1960720	1964560	So yeah, I thought the reading library was really cool.
1964560	1965760	Obviously, they have rules posted.
1965760	1967120	Don't take books out of the room.
1967120	1973680	But I'm thinking, hey, as Rama said earlier, Rama has a friend that works with localization
1973680	1974160	and stuff.
1974160	1979040	And if I'm somebody that needs to be an expert on Pokemon lore because I'm working with topics
1979040	1984480	like that, it's awfully convenient to have this kind of library right where you're at.
1984480	1986240	So I thought this was very neat.
1986240	1990000	And one other thing that they had, you have to look really carefully at the top shelf
1990560	1995120	that you can see in this picture or just look at this next slide I have that actually has
1995120	1998160	some of the movie props from Detective Pikachu.
1998160	2003280	So I had to stand on my tiptoes to get this picture, but it actually has a little ticket
2003280	2006400	that they had with Rhyme City and a little map.
2006400	2008640	And they had one of the coffees from Hi Hat Cafe.
2009440	2013840	And I believe the Detective Pikachu that you saw in the front was also a Detective
2013840	2018000	Pikachu that was from the movie, although I think it was animated.
2018000	2019760	So maybe it was like a placeholder or something.
2019760	2020320	I don't know.
2020320	2023680	But I thought it was neat to see some of the movie props were there as well.
2023680	2024960	So that was a lot of fun.
2025520	2027760	So just a couple more.
2028480	2029680	This was Alan and I.
2029680	2033280	We were just, again, the view is beautiful.
2033280	2036880	And you can actually see in this particular picture, not only do you see the bay there
2036880	2042800	in Seattle, but you actually see there's this really circular park that's down below.
2042800	2047760	This is where we, after we were done with our tour, we actually went down to this park
2047760	2052960	to actually go play Pokemon Community Day, which was a lot of fun.
2052960	2054640	It was the Teddiursa day was that day.
2054640	2057040	And I caught a four star Pokemon at that park.
2057040	2059440	And it's loaded with Poke stops.
2059440	2062960	Like every memorial bench in that place was some type of Poke stop.
2062960	2068000	So yeah, that was my little tour of the building.
2068000	2069520	I had a lot of fun.
2069520	2074080	And I'm really, really thankful for the opportunity to kind of get to peek behind the curtain
2074080	2074800	a little bit.
2074800	2077280	At the end of the day, yes, it's an office building.
2077280	2082960	But it's, again, if I got to work in an office like that, I'd go in all the time.
2082960	2084320	That was a lot of fun.
2084320	2087200	So Zen Monkey says you guys look like Pokemon trainers.
2087200	2090320	Yeah, we were that day because we got to...
2090320	2094240	And actually, I think I had my Pogo Plus on me and I was catching stuff as we were walking
2094240	2094560	around.
2094560	2096320	So that was pretty cool.
2096320	2096960	So let's see.
2096960	2101600	Bond 006 says Sony Wonder Lab in New York City here would have past products detailing
2101600	2102880	the history of the company.
2102880	2106800	As you traverse the building, you would encounter a lot of sites that either locked to specific
2106800	2109360	regions and or from other markets.
2109360	2111600	Products not really stateside or from other countries.
2111600	2117280	Yeah, a little like that library I had mentioned had some of the books from other countries,
2117280	2118240	which I thought was really cool.
2118880	2121920	And Bobby Blackwell says that's why they make cool office spaces.
2121920	2123360	It's a selling point for recruitment.
2123360	2124000	Absolutely.
2124000	2128160	I didn't even get enough pictures of the whole because there were actually two floors we
2128160	2128800	got to see.
2128800	2132320	Alan got more pictures than I did, admittedly, because I'm one of those more like I want
2132320	2133120	to be in the moment.
2133120	2135280	But then I was like, I should probably take some pictures for OLR.
2136240	2141600	So that whole little space where that last photo was is actually like all like jungle
2141600	2142080	themed.
2142080	2145120	And it's supposed to be themed after like a Pokemon type of area.
2145120	2146240	And it did look really cool.
2146240	2148720	So it was pretty neat.
2150000	2152640	Mike Def says, I wonder if they have Pokemon fusion manga in there.
2152640	2153680	It never made it overseas.
2153680	2155120	Honestly, probably.
2155120	2159120	So I didn't look those like I can't 100% confirm or deny.
2159120	2162240	So She Hulk says, did you pick up a job application?
2164240	2165840	I can't relocate at this point.
2165840	2170640	We own a home here in Sacramento now, and that's it.
2170640	2172960	I enjoy my day job a lot.
2172960	2175040	I know I don't talk about it here on the program.
2175680	2179200	I do not work in the game industry, and I am okay with that.
2179200	2181600	My day job is a very boring.
2181600	2183280	And I say that in the best possible way.
2183280	2186480	Corporate job with a very boring corporate office.
2186480	2190160	I again say that the nicest possible way that doesn't look anything like what we just saw.
2190160	2192240	And I'm perfectly happy with where I'm at.
2192240	2199120	So no, I did not get a job application, but I'm thrilled for my friend who does work there
2199120	2203520	and obviously raves about it and was able to give us that opportunity and so forth.
2203520	2206560	And it was just a cool little extra little perk for our trip.
2206560	2208560	So awesome.
2208560	2210720	Bobby Lockwell says, do they need a corporate trainer?
2213040	2214880	Keep in mind, I don't do the training anymore.
2214880	2216800	I manage that.
2216800	2219520	So anyway, but not to get too into that.
2219520	2221280	So let's see.
2222480	2223280	Yeah, so thank you.
2223280	2225440	Thank you for the comments in our chat room there.
2225440	2227840	And yeah, thanks again for the tour.
2227840	2232720	And yeah, maybe next time I'm there, maybe they'll update some things and we'll get a
2232720	2234720	2.0 look at things.
2234720	2235760	So, all right.
2235760	2236880	In the meantime, let's move on.
2236880	2240480	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing
2240480	2242480	this week, whether it was Pokemon or something else.
2242480	2243760	Let's go to Loki.
2243760	2244640	How was your gaming week?
2245200	2247040	It was Minecraft.
2249120	2254320	I haven't gone back to play more of the Go Simulator 3 stuff.
2254320	2257840	My kid's been bugging me to do it though, because he's like 100% in the thing now.
2258640	2259140	Wow.
2259760	2262320	But yeah, I've been playing a lot of Minecraft.
2262320	2265040	I started obviously the modded series last week.
2265040	2270080	So did that and that's been fun.
2270080	2270960	Messed around with that.
2270960	2273520	And then I'm still working on stuff for Channel 64 as well.
2273520	2275920	I've been doing that like last few days.
2276480	2278080	So it's slow going.
2278080	2280720	I'm coming up on four weeks since I put out an actual video.
2281600	2287040	I mean, I did live stream in the middle there, but it's, you know, I'm cognizant of the time.
2288000	2292160	It keeps getting more complicated, the builds that I'm doing.
2292160	2294000	So it takes time.
2294000	2294800	But yeah.
2294800	2297840	And then, you know, more characters being designed.
2297840	2300640	I almost have all eight of my robot masters designed now.
2300640	2304800	So it's just, I think we're one left.
2304800	2306880	I think it'd be pretty cool.
2306880	2309360	So those have been being posted on Twitter and stuff.
2310400	2311680	But yeah, that's pretty much it.
2311680	2312480	It's been Minecraft.
2313280	2313780	All right.
2314400	2315040	My gaming week.
2315040	2318480	Again, I was out of town for a few days, as I'm sure a lot of people were off celebrating
2318480	2319520	the holidays in the States.
2320240	2323200	So I didn't play a lot of new stuff, but I continued on with some of the stuff I've been
2323200	2323760	playing.
2323760	2327600	So ironically, with Pokemon, I'm still been playing Pokemon Scarlet.
2327600	2331040	I keep on saying Scarlet and Violet, but technically I'm playing Pokemon Scarlet.
2331840	2333280	And I've been continuing on with that.
2333280	2338640	I am at two, two and two, which if you know the basics of the game, it isn't just gyms
2338640	2339280	now anymore.
2339280	2339920	That's one part.
2339920	2343520	That's so I've beaten two gyms, but now there are star bases.
2343520	2345200	You can think Team Rocket.
2345200	2346720	You know, there's a new version of that.
2346720	2347920	The antagonist in every game.
2347920	2348880	This one's Team Star.
2349680	2354160	And I love some of the little sayings they have, like Hasta la vie star and the little
2354160	2356880	little gang sign they do as a little star.
2356880	2357600	It's super cute.
2358560	2365200	So I'm at two star bases and two Titan Pokemon, which is kind of a new thing where it's like,
2366320	2371680	it reminds me a little bit of there's a mechanic in another game like this, but it just basically
2371680	2374240	larger basically raid Pokemon that are out in the wild.
2374240	2377520	I don't know how else to describe it, but I've done two of those as well.
2378480	2384080	I have been keeping my playthrough to only on stream as well, which is part of the reason
2384080	2385840	why I'm a little slower going than some.
2386560	2391040	But I've been really enjoying playing on stream on stream this week.
2392320	2395840	The folks actually watched me run right by a shiny.
2396560	2397280	That's right.
2397280	2398080	I passed up.
2398080	2401680	I missed a fucking shiny until it was too late.
2403200	2405040	That that hurt, to be honest.
2405600	2406320	What can I say?
2406320	2410400	Actually, I want to see if I can actually get that clip as much as it pains me to play
2410400	2410900	this.
2411680	2418800	It was pretty interesting because I want to show you like just how easy this is to miss.
2418800	2419600	So how do I do this?
2419600	2421200	I'm going to go over to this monitor.
2421200	2422320	I'm going to make this large.
2422320	2425920	Okay, sorry, I'm doing some I'm doing some producing live on the fly here.
2425920	2429600	So and I'll describe this again for those in chat.
2429600	2431200	I'll just on the feed.
2431200	2433600	I'll just I'll describe what's happening.
2433600	2435200	Some of this audio is going to come through.
2435200	2437920	So let me I'm going to play the clip respond over there.
2441760	2443520	I'm fitting it for people.
2443520	2444020	Shut up.
2444880	2445840	Or you're next.
2445840	2446880	Give me your lunch money.
2448640	2450480	And that's where Shane says there was a shiny.
2451280	2452000	Did you see it?
2452720	2454480	Those of you watching on Twitch on this Sunday night.
2454480	2455440	Did you see the shiny?
2456560	2458480	Let me point out where the shiny was.
2458480	2461440	So the problem was me replay.
2462160	2467200	My eyes were here because I'm fixated on Oh, I'm sorry, you can't see me.
2467200	2469360	Okay, my eyes were in the center of the screen.
2469360	2473840	And I was fixated on the road ahead because I'm riding my little legendary Pokemon trying
2473840	2476560	to get back up the trail because I had fallen down or something.
2476560	2479120	It's something I didn't intend to do happened.
2479120	2484160	So as my eyes are over on this side of the screen, what happens is I'm running by.
2484720	2486560	It's really blink and you miss it.
2487280	2491200	Look, a pack of drift flumes comes up on the left.
2491200	2494320	And sure enough, one of them is a yellow shiny.
2494320	2498640	But because my eyes were over on the right side and not way on the left for that shiny
2498640	2500960	was I ended up running right by it.
2500960	2504480	And that that was that was how literally one second.
2504480	2504980	Shut up.
2505920	2506480	Or you're next.
2506480	2506960	And I missed it.
2506960	2507760	Give me your lunch money.
2511200	2513440	Y'all want to hear a sad story for the holidays, right?
2513760	2517040	Oh, well, it's just a shiny shiny Pokemon are stupid.
2517040	2517920	Anyway, that's Shane's thing.
2517920	2518640	That's not my thing.
2522640	2523680	That's a flower.
2523680	2525280	I know I know.
2525280	2526080	All right.
2526080	2529520	Anyway, so I was playing Pokemon and yeah, thank you.
2529520	2530400	F's in the chat.
2530400	2533360	I love F F as an unknown in the chat for Rob.
2533360	2534080	Thanks, Steph.
2534080	2534560	Appreciate it.
2535760	2538720	So yeah, I've been playing Scarlet and Violet and I've still been playing Dead by Daylight
2538720	2539280	a little bit.
2539280	2541920	It's the reason why that game still appears.
2541920	2545920	The reason why that game still appeals to me, even though, well, they did release new
2545920	2547120	content this last week.
2547120	2549280	They have a new killer, the Knight.
2549280	2552160	So the Knight's mechanic is that he can summon his friends.
2552160	2556400	He has the brotherhood and you actually trace these little routes and then your friends
2556400	2558080	patrol the routes.
2558080	2561920	And then if a survivor walks through him, the friend can actually damage him.
2561920	2563440	So it's kind of an interesting little twist.
2564320	2567200	So the Knight and then there's a new survivor as well, Vittorio.
2568080	2571200	And so, yeah, I've just been leveling up the new survivor in that game because I want to
2571200	2574320	get his perks because he has some really good perks that I want to get.
2575760	2577280	But yes, that's what's really it.
2577280	2578480	Pokemon Dead by Daylight.
2578480	2578960	That's it.
2578960	2581120	I haven't been playing a lot else this week because the holiday.
2581120	2584160	So all right, we'll get some more games next week for sure.
2584160	2586880	And I'll still be playing Pokemon on stream.
2587680	2589680	I did play a little vampire survivors.
2589680	2591120	Actually, I talked about that last week.
2591120	2592160	How I got back into that recently.
2592160	2594560	I think I did fire that up on like Monday or Tuesday night.
2594560	2596880	I did another run through on that game.
2596880	2603520	So that's the genre I'm feeling right now is those survivor games of which if you think
2603520	2605760	we haven't seen plenty yet, just wait.
2605760	2606880	Just wait next year.
2606880	2608320	It's going to be going to be the new thing.
2608320	2609600	It's not roguelikes.
2609600	2614960	It's which ironically, these survivor games are a derivative of roguelikes.
2614960	2618800	But that's that's going to be the big thing in the coming months for sure.
2618800	2624320	So all right, let's move on and get into some gaming news this week of which admittedly
2624320	2625840	there's not as much.
2625840	2630640	So we may not be here as long tonight, but we're going to get through what there there
2630640	2637040	is come out and a big one to start us off about a big game that came out a week ago
2637040	2638640	that everybody is still talking about.
2639520	2649440	And this is why the Pokemon company and Game Freak will never worry about quality in their
2649440	2653280	games because you folks will just buy them regardless.
2653280	2659120	Pokemon, Scarlet and Violet have sold over 10 million copies in the first weekend.
2660080	2661120	Congratulations.
2661120	2662720	You guys are part of the problem now.
2662720	2665600	And how about a 9.5 million of those are preorders?
2665600	2667200	Easy, easy.
2667200	2668640	I'm sure that they are.
2668640	2671120	But you know, it is what it is.
2671120	2676960	And that that's no one can complain about quality in those games now because you've
2676960	2677920	voted with your wallet.
2677920	2679440	So that's what you're going to get.
2679440	2685920	I I mean, yes, the game is buggy, but it like for me, it honestly doesn't ruin it.
2685920	2689280	I and I don't know if I'm at the point where I would say the bugs are charming.
2690400	2694640	Like I know you enjoy like driver just because it's one of those so bad buggy.
2694640	2696080	It's good type of games.
2696080	2701280	I'm not sure I would put Pokemon firmly in that camp, but the bugs are just like laughably
2701280	2702240	bad when they happen.
2702240	2703040	And then that's all it is.
2703040	2705040	I laugh it off because it doesn't break my game.
2705040	2707200	I have heard there are game breaking bugs.
2707200	2713520	It hasn't happened to me and I auto save enough where I feel like I don't even if a breaking
2713520	2716560	bug happened to me, I don't think it would really shut me down.
2717440	2718000	But I don't know.
2718000	2722800	Like I I don't want to say I'm totally reminded of the Mass Effect Andromeda issues because
2723360	2725360	here here's also a great example.
2726480	2729680	Mass Effect Andromeda released three days early to a certain audience.
2729680	2733200	So all of this hit the Internet so everybody could say stop and wait.
2733200	2738400	Nintendo, on the other hand, keeps this shit under iron lock and fucking key until this
2738400	2739280	game comes out.
2739280	2741440	Now, they didn't stop leaks from happening.
2741440	2745040	So there were news out there about the games being a little bit buggy.
2745600	2750000	But I don't think I don't even think the leakers knew the full extent of like all the crazy
2750000	2752800	things you could do in the game until the games were out.
2752800	2758080	But it you know, and I said this back then with Mass Effect Andromeda, EA's huge mistake
2758080	2762320	was being greedy with that online program and letting people play that game three days
2762320	2762640	early.
2762720	2765840	That is that is one of the biggest mistakes EA has ever made.
2767040	2770400	Quite honestly, because I mean, once they release the game, especially a month after
2770400	2772480	when they fix the bugs, the game is fine.
2773600	2781040	But it's Yeah, well, it's it's it's perpetuating the problem, though, that we have where it's
2781040	2785200	okay now for these companies to release games that are clearly not ready for launch.
2785840	2792080	And that's the problem is, is whether it's motivation by we just got to get it out before
2792080	2798400	holiday sales happen, or we're, you know, incentivized, which isn't good enough, or
2798400	2802720	the switch isn't good enough, you know, it could be some of that, that I would still
2802720	2807760	argue, though, that other games have run more smoothly, it's I think it's less that it's
2807760	2815840	more or less optimized game is more impacted by the switches, not cutting edge performance
2815840	2816480	anymore.
2816560	2822160	And so whereas some games, you know, on other causes could get by with not being optimized
2822160	2822880	as much.
2823520	2828800	It does affect it when you're having to really squeeze every ounce of power and performance
2828800	2829840	out of this console.
2829840	2833600	Yeah, it's not, you know, it's, it's unfortunate.
2833600	2837840	Like, there's a lot of games where I would have given it a pass, you know, if it's like
2837840	2844560	extremely buggy and stuff, but it's, it's becoming a point now where we I don't think
2844560	2845760	we can do that anymore.
2845760	2850720	Because there's just so many games that we hear about coming out being broken and buggy.
2850720	2855120	And it's because we're sending the message just pre ordering and buying these games,
2855120	2860160	you know, without knowing what we're getting into the where they're just like, how many
2860160	2863840	stories have we heard about different companies putting out roadmaps about how they're going
2863840	2864560	to fix their game?
2865680	2866400	It's ridiculous.
2866400	2871520	I get I get messages on Facebook all the time I see because I follow Saints Row on there
2871520	2876880	about how they're all over or we're working on our performance something something like
2876880	2878160	I don't even care anymore.
2878160	2884640	Like I just don't because it's like so far out past launch and you're still fixing the
2884640	2889200	game that was released in the state like I don't know.
2889200	2893600	All right, and this it looks bad for Nintendo, I think, but I think it looks bad for the
2893600	2894160	switch.
2894160	2899040	I you know, I put a lot of the blame on the switch being antiquated hardware is the Nintendo
2899040	2904160	probably has to I would say that they can't take the stance of like, well, we're just
2904160	2907200	going to be a new couple generations behind performance.
2908080	2909840	I don't think you should be doing that anymore.
2909840	2911040	There's effects.
2911040	2913200	Well, I was just say there's some important comments in chat I want to read.
2914080	2918480	First off quest Buster who brings up I think another one of those franchises that gets
2918480	2920880	away with his bugs and it's because they're adorable.
2921520	2927680	Quest Buster says for me Bethesda's Elder Scrolls RPGs like Skyrim are notoriously buggy,
2927680	2931440	but I slog through those because I was still able to enjoy them quite a bit.
2931440	2935360	Still would love to see them improve their bug squashing though, hopefully with Starfield.
2935360	2940800	I think that is a great analogy because a lot of people will defend Skyrim and those
2940800	2945680	games release in really sad buggy states, but you kind of let it slide because it's
2945680	2947120	a great story and a great game.
2947840	2950160	Well, but in that is almost the same.
2950160	2956480	It's it's a similar situation too, because you're talking about Skyrim, which is running
2957200	2959120	on old engine hard.
2959120	2962320	I mean, the engine is the thing that is old in that now.
2962320	2964480	Yeah, I've been used in multiple games.
2964480	2967520	And so you see a lot of their modern games that they're putting out.
2967520	2971840	They're still using that really old engine at being really buggy.
2971840	2977360	Fallout 76, Fallout 4, like all of that stuff is still very buggy because they're using
2978000	2984160	outdated engines to build this same thing can happen with, you know, using outdated
2984160	2985040	hardware.
2985040	2989360	It's you're going to run into bottlenecks somewhere, whether that be the engine that
2989360	2993440	you programmed where I can't do the efficiencies I want because it just doesn't support it
2993440	2995840	anymore or just whatever.
2995840	3002560	And yeah, it story and the rest of the polish of the game does matter as far as like being
3002560	3004560	accepting what you'll look past.
3004560	3009440	Yeah, and that's and that's really what it and Mike Deaf says it in chat here is that
3009440	3013840	the bugs aren't game breaking for the most part, but the game is genuinely fun and great.
3013840	3018000	And honestly, from my perspective, I have to agree, like both those things can be true.
3018000	3020640	I can sit here and say, yeah, the bugs are really disappointing.
3020640	3024800	Like the fact that there are so many technical glitches still in the game, it's disappointing.
3024800	3028880	And the fact that the switch is very obviously antiquated hardware at this point is disappointing.
3029600	3030400	All that can be true.
3030400	3035520	And I can still say, but damn, this game, I love what the open world stuff did for Pokemon.
3035520	3041200	I really like it took a few hours of gameplay to really grow me because at first I wasn't
3041200	3044080	sure because it was just so different from sword and shield.
3044080	3048000	But damn, now that I spent a couple hours with it, I'm like, I really love what the
3048000	3049680	open world stuff has done for Pokemon.
3049680	3051840	And I really can't wait to see where it goes.
3051840	3057520	Hopefully, the next generation on a like, swear to God, Gen 10 better not be for the
3057520	3058320	switch.
3058320	3060720	Gen 10 needs to be for the next Nintendo hardware.
3060720	3062960	And I'm really looking forward to that.
3062960	3066160	Actually, what I'm really, really looking forward to is the next Pokemon Legends game
3066160	3067760	because they better fucking do one.
3067760	3069600	And it also better not be on the switch.
3070320	3073200	Because I want to see what they can do with more advanced hardware.
3073200	3077280	Yeah, I'm just worried that like the the message that we're sending with that stuff in don't
3077280	3079840	get me wrong, like, like I get it a great game.
3079840	3082480	So it could be great, even though it has bugs in it and stuff.
3082480	3086240	But also, like there are there were some glaring bugs.
3086240	3087040	It's not like that.
3087040	3090000	Oh, hey, I did this weird thing that normally people don't do it.
3090000	3093360	It was an untested case that we found some bugs and stuff like that.
3093360	3097600	We're talking like very blatant, very performance based bugs that they knew that they
3097600	3098480	need to iron out.
3098480	3100880	And I hope that they will eventually iron out.
3100880	3105520	But some executives, some corporate executives at Game Freak made the decision that we're
3105520	3107840	going to release this in the state that it is now.
3107840	3108400	Yeah.
3108400	3112480	And so that's what you have to keep in mind is that they made that mistake and they're
3112480	3115200	like, well, I don't know, maybe the fans might not take to it.
3115200	3118640	And now that you took to it, they're going to be like, oh, well, next time, you know,
3118640	3123360	it it's not in perfect polished shape, but we're just going to release it anyways.
3123360	3125120	And I worry that it's going to get worse.
3125120	3127760	Yeah, I have with other franchises.
3127760	3129120	Yeah, that kind of thing happened.
3129120	3131040	That is an industry problem.
3131040	3132480	I absolutely agree with that.
3132480	3136400	And it's one of those things where oftentimes people want to say, oh, the industry has this
3136400	3138240	problem, but not Nintendo, not Nintendo.
3138240	3138800	They're there.
3138800	3143280	And I understand Pokemon is technically not a Nintendo game, but we literally just had
3143280	3147920	Loki say it is Nintendo's biggest franchise officially as so.
3147920	3152080	So yes, Pokemon and Nintendo are very much embedded together.
3152080	3153520	It is a Nintendo company.
3153520	3154080	I'm sorry.
3154080	3154960	Yeah, I know.
3154960	3160720	Do we publish Pokemon games on other platforms, other console platforms, iOS, Android, Nintendo
3160720	3161920	company, iOS, Android?
3161920	3163520	That is not a console.
3163520	3165600	That is that is mobile games.
3165600	3166320	I'm sorry.
3166320	3167040	That doesn't count.
3168400	3171120	It's it is a Nintendo company.
3171120	3173280	It may be like a second party company.
3173280	3174720	However, we want to distinguish it.
3174720	3178560	But it is a company that makes games that are featured.
3178560	3180480	And it's not only Nintendo game.
3180480	3181360	It's not just go.
3181360	3183120	It's Pokemon cafe.
3183120	3185280	There's, I think, a trading card thing that's there too.
3185280	3188160	So Pokemon does have a mobile space.
3188160	3189840	But I get what you're saying.
3189840	3192800	But yeah, you know, Loki and I will agree with what you're saying.
3192800	3194240	This is an industry problem.
3194240	3196560	And it's one that this game is exhibit A.
3196560	3198160	Nintendo is not immune to it.
3198160	3201760	We release games in buggy states because we need them to be out by a certain day.
3202320	3203920	And that's what it is.
3203920	3208080	By the way, an interesting fix that I read about and I haven't had a chance to test this
3208080	3214640	yet, but I did notice that my game was running off of the SD card because that's where the
3214640	3218400	game chose to install by default was my expansion SD card.
3218400	3223120	Apparently, if you copy the game from the SD card, move it, I guess move it from the
3223120	3226880	SD card to the system hardware, it will function better.
3226880	3228320	I'm not sure why that is.
3228320	3232320	It's not like these cards are plate drives that are spinning up that are causing lag.
3232880	3236800	But I could see that even a couple microseconds of lag is lag.
3236800	3240720	So I did move the game over to the system.
3240720	3246000	I did that in some downtime because I actually did play a little bit off stream.
3246000	3250640	But all I did off stream was I went to the academy and started advancing all those classes
3250640	3254080	you can go to, like do some of that stuff that's just like pushing A to read through
3254080	3255200	quest text over and over.
3255200	3259520	I did some of that stuff off stream so I could not have to spend time on stream doing it.
3260160	3264160	And so before I did that, I moved the game over because apparently that is supposed to
3264160	3265120	reduce the bugs.
3265120	3268880	I don't know if that's just urban legend at this point or what it is.
3268880	3272720	No, I would imagine that that's probably a thing because it's the same.
3272720	3276480	It's like when we were talking about running games off disk drives and installing to your
3276480	3280000	hard drive back in the Xbox 360 days or PlayStation three days.
3280000	3285120	Yeah, it's it's the drive speeds are it could even be the SD speeds are faster.
3285120	3293440	You know, whether you have, you know, on on hardware flash RAM or whatever flash ROMs
3293440	3298640	that you have in there that you can store that data to versus reading through an SD
3298640	3303680	card slot, which is bottlenecked by, you know, that process as well.
3303680	3304640	The bus on that.
3304640	3308160	So it's it is very possible that that is the case.
3308160	3311520	But that also goes back to that the hardware is not powerful enough.
3311520	3317600	Also, the game's not optimized enough to be able to, you know, cache that basically loading
3317600	3318160	in that data.
3318160	3322480	That's why you have pop in and some of these open world games is because it can't read
3322480	3322960	the data.
3322960	3329040	They don't have it compressed enough or, you know, doing LEDs, whatever it might take to
3329040	3330080	load that stuff in there.
3330080	3334800	They're not doing it in an efficient enough manner because the hardware can't keep up
3334800	3335280	with it.
3335280	3340400	So either you either optimize the hell out of it to, you know, work on the, you know,
3341360	3347200	lesser than ideal powered hardware, or you get more powerful hardware to run your game.
3347200	3351520	Mike Defton chat says portable mode and installed on the console does run better.
3351520	3353360	I personally tested it interesting.
3354080	3358400	And then some other folks, multiple people in chat pointing out that SD cards can vary
3358400	3359440	in speed.
3359440	3364320	So it could also be a reason why it causes some of the issues that'll be interesting
3364320	3369520	to see how much of an improvement I notice moving it to the but that just FYI, if you
3369520	3374000	hadn't heard that yourself, and you're a Pokemon scarlet or violet player, that's a tip.
3374000	3375280	Don't run it off the SD card.
3375280	3378960	If you can help it, move it to the main console, you can you can use data management, your
3378960	3380480	options and kind of move things around.
3380560	3384480	You can even even uninstall things to download them later if you don't have a bandwidth cap
3384480	3385120	to worry about.
3385680	3388720	But I was able to pretty easily move things around to make that work.
3389280	3390240	Your mileage may vary.
3391360	3393120	Now I wanted to move to this story real quick.
3393120	3394800	I know you probably have one other thing.
3394800	3396960	Did you have one other thing you want to get out Logie with this?
3396960	3398880	Yeah, just so that people are seeking refunds.
3398880	3402880	I mean, yeah, if you're unhappy with the state of the games, and then sure, go seek
3402880	3403520	refund.
3403520	3406560	Yeah, I mean, that's just common sense, I would say.
3407360	3411280	Well, the fact that they're getting them from Nintendo is the news there, in my opinion.
3411920	3413040	This isn't a steam game.
3413040	3414240	This is an epic store game.
3414240	3417200	It's a Nintendo game, who are notoriously hard asses.
3419440	3426400	I mean, I guess it's but it's not like, because I don't think it's unheard of.
3426400	3428560	I mean, they know the state that it's in.
3428560	3432080	They're not completely like what the games release in this.
3432720	3433280	They know.
3433280	3434080	I mean, come on.
3434080	3437200	DJI who says, wait, Nintendo is giving out refunds.
3437200	3442800	Apparently, yes, we are hearing cases of refunds, but we don't we don't know the policy.
3442800	3445760	Nintendo has not come out to state any sort of policy.
3445760	3450480	And they probably won't, knowing Nintendo, but I guarantee they're not going to.
3450480	3454320	So we're really left off of tweets and Reddit posts.
3454320	3458000	And you know, it's up to you how much faith you want to put in that type of stuff.
3459280	3462720	Ironically, I have something about a Reddit post.
3462720	3465760	So again, I'm just going to state this is from a Reddit post.
3465760	3468000	So I'm not even sure if it's true or not.
3468720	3471920	But I want to you know, it's a slower Newsweek.
3471920	3475040	And it's one of those interesting things where I wouldn't be surprised if it's true.
3477040	3482640	Apparently, one player on Reddit decided to go to Nintendo's customer support and revealed
3482640	3484480	the response that they received.
3484480	3490000	The employee claimed this was the first they'd heard about any issues with the games.
3490080	3493440	And there are no patches or updates in place to fix the problems.
3494000	3496160	This has now turned way I gotta say that.
3496160	3496400	Hold on.
3496400	3496720	Hold on.
3496720	3497920	Look, I see the face you're making.
3497920	3498880	I need to get through this.
3499600	3500100	Sure.
3502720	3503200	Number one.
3503200	3508560	Now that is the headline that is running rampant through the industry is Nintendo does not
3508560	3511760	plan to address Pokemon and Scarlet Violet issues.
3513120	3516720	That is that that that is a bad headline to run.
3516720	3518160	I'm going to tell you why.
3518160	3521440	I guarantee this customer service support.
3522000	3526080	They have a book, they have a Bible, they have a line, they have to stick to it.
3526080	3529680	I'm not saying the line that they have to stick to is to lie about the technical support
3529680	3530480	with the game.
3530480	3535440	But the line they have to stick to is there are no patches at this time plan for Scarlet
3535440	3536080	and Violet.
3536080	3539280	They can't come out and say, Oh, yeah, well, we'll give that to the team to do a patch.
3539280	3544400	Well, they they can only say what they can say and they can only know what they know,
3544400	3550080	which one week after the game is out during the Thanksgiving holiday in the US is take
3550080	3551920	away not fucking much.
3552800	3559360	So this is a really shitty headline to pull out of a Reddit story interaction with customer
3559360	3564320	service who doesn't have the script to deal with the situation yet.
3564320	3565440	That is the reality.
3566800	3572160	So, but now and then people are saying no, no complaints have been filed about Scarlet
3572160	3576160	Violet, that part I actually would see is true.
3577440	3583760	Why why complain through the proper channels when you can just bitch about it on social
3583760	3584160	media?
3586080	3591440	So the Reddit Redditor says I filed a complaint about Scarlet Violet performance with Nintendo
3591440	3592240	support today.
3592240	3595680	And I encourage anyone who has had issues with the frame rate clipping game crashes,
3595680	3598480	stuttering, lagging, etc to file a complaint as well.
3598480	3602000	That is the part of the story I would actually agree with.
3602640	3607520	If you really feel passionately about it, register a formal complaint that is going
3607520	3609440	to force Nintendo's hand more than anything.
3609440	3609920	Oh, God.
3609920	3614480	Now I'm just realizing as I'm reading through this entire post, I was able to speak with
3614480	3621600	a real person in the chat feature that everything I just said 60 seconds ago, even worse chat
3621600	3622560	feature.
3622560	3630160	I I can't prove it, but I would almost certainly I would bet money it's offshored.
3631040	3635360	And those folks really have a script on what they can and can't say.
3637280	3642240	So Mike Deaf says let me guess Kotaku actually no, but I'm not surprised they ran with the
3642240	3642960	headline either.
3643520	3646800	This particular article I got pointed to is from the gamer.com.
3646800	3651200	But I'm telling you, put it in Google News, you'll find 50 start sites that turn this
3651200	3654880	Reddit post during a slow newsweek into a headline.
3655520	3661520	And again, there are some pieces of this that I do think are worth saying.
3661520	3666400	So the one part where I will say, yes, Redditor, you're right, is filing a complaint about
3666400	3668160	Scarlet Violet performance with Nintendo.
3668160	3671520	That is the only way something will actually get done about the situation.
3671520	3674240	But this whole customer service told me this.
3674240	3675760	Therefore, it must be true.
3675760	3677280	And I don't fault the Redditor for this.
3677280	3678720	This isn't me picking on them.
3678720	3685440	This is me just saying the reality is you're talking to customer service who is probably
3685440	3691440	contracted with a company, Nintendo, that is not even the company that made Pokemon.
3692480	3695520	But again, we all associate them with it contracted.
3695520	3698560	You are literally talking to a ditto of a ditto.
3698560	3702320	And I'm not even intending to use Pokemon terms, but I guess I did.
3702320	3706560	You are talking to a ditto of a ditto, probably a ditto of a ditto of ditto, because there's
3706560	3709280	probably another contractual agreement between offshore and the customer service.
3709280	3712320	You're talking three dittos deep with customer service.
3713600	3719200	Of course, they don't have shit to say to you, but they'll register their ticket in
3719200	3722400	Salesforce and somebody will get back to you in seven to ten days.
3724480	3729600	Mike Defton chat says, as a person who worked at customer service calls for a US company,
3729600	3731120	scripts are the name of the game.
3732640	3735040	And remind us where you live, Mike Deft, Mexico.
3735040	3735540	Yep.
3736240	3739840	Fifth Dream says, yeah, contracted with a third party even, so they don't even technically
3739840	3740880	work for Nintendo.
3740880	3743040	And it's Game Freak's game, not Nintendo's game.
3743040	3744480	So we're three dittos deep.
3745520	3748000	SSG100Matt says, a mimic you of a ditto.
3749040	3749540	Yeah.
3750160	3753280	Tiger Claw says, you probably are talking to someone from India.
3753280	3758080	Perhaps could be the Philippines, could be a number of offshore places that are very
3758080	3758880	popular.
3758880	3762480	It could be another part of the US.
3762480	3764560	Sometimes offshore is still within the US.
3764640	3767120	I'm not going to make that stuff up right now in the moment.
3767120	3771280	But all I'm going to say is, again, as far as reporting off customer service statements
3771280	3776400	go, gaming journalists of the world do not report on customer service interactions.
3776400	3777200	It is not news.
3778480	3778980	It's not.
3780080	3781360	You all should know better.
3781360	3783600	How fucking long have these websites been around?
3783600	3789120	Making articles based off of like a Reddit post is kind of lame anyways, or the ones
3789120	3791440	that report off of like a single tweet.
3792320	3795760	Have you ever really looked at those Facebook ads you get all the time?
3795760	3800160	They are all like it's you would never believe what happened to these 10 celebrities.
3800160	3801360	Number five will shock you.
3801360	3806000	And it is literally all Reddit posts compiled into a news story.
3806000	3809040	This is like where journalism is at these days is Reddit posts.
3809040	3810480	It's and tweets.
3810480	3812320	Tweets is the other big one as well.
3812320	3816800	Y'all know I have some strong feelings about Twitter and how really tweets should not be
3816800	3823920	news at this point, because we know that, you know, literally they will let little literally
3823920	3825760	anyone back on Twitter.
3827760	3834000	And by verification for eight dollars, so gaming industry, if you're going to report
3834000	3840400	on tweets from here on out, that's y'all's ass like that's y'all's ass.
3840400	3845840	We as podcasters, you, me, Dark Sakura, everybody out there that wants to have a respectable
3845840	3846720	gaming podcast.
3846720	3848880	And I say I say this full on self-aware.
3848880	3850720	We have made this mistake in the past.
3850720	3852640	So I'm going to own those mistakes in the past.
3852640	3858320	I'm going to say moving forward, we need to fucking watch if we report on Reddit posts
3858320	3858960	and tweets.
3858960	3861040	And if we do, we need to say so.
3861040	3862720	So we can take it with a big grain of salt.
3862720	3865760	And that's why I started this was saying take this with a grain of salt because it comes
3865760	3866480	from a Reddit post.
3868400	3869360	No offense to Reddit.
3869360	3870320	I love Reddit.
3870320	3870820	Most of it.
3872480	3875680	There's some pretty shitholes in Reddit, but most of Reddit.
3875680	3876480	I really enjoy.
3877360	3882240	And, you know, you do get a lot of really interesting stories and you get a lot of people
3882240	3885760	willing to tell you things on Reddit because they can hide behind a name that they wouldn't
3885760	3887120	say, you know, somewhere else.
3887120	3889840	So it does lead to some fascinating stuff sometimes.
3889840	3890880	That's for sure.
3890880	3892480	So let's see.
3894320	3895120	Looking in chat.
3896400	3901200	SHO 100 Matt says the logic is like I talked to a DIS customer support person in a chat
3901200	3902400	window about DW.
3902400	3903520	I'm assuming Disney World.
3903520	3905040	So I spoke to Bob Iger.
3905040	3907200	Yeah, did your own?
3907200	3908000	Oh, excuse me.
3908000	3913280	Quest Buster says, Yes, YouTube, you won't believe what happened in X Games Syndrome.
3913280	3918960	Oh, God, you want to talk about another cesspool of Reddit posts becoming clickbait to get
3918960	3919600	your ads?
3919600	3921120	It's that.
3922560	3925280	So anyway, just throwing that out there.
3925280	3926240	Just throwing that out there.
3927520	3929120	Okay, let's move on.
3929120	3930800	Let's change the topic a little bit.
3930800	3934480	Let's talk about other parts of Nintendo that make us scream internally.
3935840	3938640	Loki or externally, thanks to Loki.
3940640	3943200	Yes, Nintendo and their litigious side.
3943200	3944320	Of course, you got to love it.
3945440	3952800	So Nintendo is now coming after people with DMCA takedowns regarding fan created steam
3952800	3953440	icons.
3954000	3956560	It's a user database called Steam Grid DB.
3957200	3964560	And I believe custom icons that you can get for I'm assuming big picture mode and for
3964560	3968880	different like games that you want to have in your library that maybe you obviously steam
3968880	3970240	doesn't have in the library.
3970240	3974880	So you can use those or maybe you just want to put legends of the breath of the wild on
3975920	3977040	among us or something like that.
3977040	3977760	I don't know.
3977760	3985760	But it is allowing you to basically, you know, put those different game cover arts or whatever
3985760	3989120	on or you can import them into your library.
3989120	3994880	Well, now they're, they're, of course, doing copyright notices, because, you know, there's
3994880	3999120	official artwork in there from Nintendo, and they don't want it to be related to with a
3999120	4007200	site that is not facilitating emulation, per se, but it's just like, we're adding some
4007760	4010480	dressing to your emulation that you're doing, I guess.
4012160	4018080	So right now, they are taking down just basically anything that's using display Nintendo characters
4018080	4024080	or intellectual property that could be likely to lead consumer confusion.
4025760	4030960	And then of course, this has been the site has actually taken some of the stuff down as well.
4031600	4034480	And right now, they're not kind of going after stuff.
4034480	4035680	It's like fan art.
4035680	4038400	But I mean, I wouldn't rule that out at this point.
4040400	4040960	I don't know.
4040960	4041760	I'm not surprised.
4041760	4043440	But also, like, really,
4044000	4045120	you brought up fan art.
4045120	4050400	And I'm waiting for the day when Nintendo sues one of those fan boosts at a convention
4050400	4054480	or something that's producing artwork based I mean, they let's be real, we know they've
4054480	4060160	turned a big, you know, they've turned their back big time to that sort of thing.
4060160	4061840	And they don't look directly at it.
4061840	4064560	And we all we all worry when that shoe is going to drop.
4065200	4068240	But maybe they also realize that something like that.
4068240	4071520	Maybe that is where they know the line is that that really would do more harm than good.
4072080	4073840	But well, yeah, I'm all that stuff.
4073840	4075280	All that stuff is on borrowed time.
4075280	4077840	Let's just let's just be real artists in the world.
4077840	4079280	I'm being real with you.
4079280	4080240	Love what you do.
4080240	4080880	Love your work.
4080880	4082240	Love your interpretations.
4082880	4084000	Y'all are on borrowed time.
4086160	4092080	Well, just I don't know, I think I think nothing will happen to Nintendo is what I think.
4092080	4096880	Honestly, like at this point, they can release buggy games, they can be litigious like crazy.
4097840	4098340	Do we not?
4098800	4103920	Do we not remember that not literally a few years ago, they had a process where you couldn't
4103920	4109120	even make YouTube videos unless you signed up with their service, and then they would
4109120	4110640	still take all their ad revenue.
4110640	4112320	This is a company that you're dealing with.
4112320	4113440	You guys all love them.
4113440	4116640	You're going to buy their games no matter what we're going to do literally whatever
4116640	4118320	they want, and you're going to just eat it up.
4118320	4122880	So I will say, Logie, there is how quickly we forget.
4122880	4126800	Gamers have also shown they are willing to not buy Nintendo.
4127200	4128480	Wii U says hello.
4130080	4130580	So.
4131680	4135680	You know, yes, they've had the magic touch with the switch and the Wii and, you know,
4135680	4136000	Liza.
4136000	4137760	But let's be real, Loki.
4137760	4139920	The Wii U is a blemish on Nintendo.
4140800	4143760	Yeah, one that's like decades old, though.
4143760	4146400	So I mean, decades, not decades.
4146400	4147200	It feels that.
4147200	4148400	Stop the revisionist history.
4148400	4149280	You read that on Reddit.
4151680	4152640	How old I feel.
4153760	4155280	Okay, well, that that I accept.
4156160	4158160	It's one console.
4158160	4160080	Like, I don't think it matters.
4160080	4162560	It really doesn't matter at this point, because that's in the past.
4162560	4163060	Yeah.
4163920	4164420	All right.
4165040	4167840	Well, moving on to something maybe less controversial.
4167840	4168160	I don't know.
4168160	4170880	I think I think this is DLC that doesn't ruffle a lot of feathers.
4171680	4174080	I will say that actually, let's let's be real.
4174080	4177120	We've had a lot of of hard feedback for Nintendo.
4177120	4179920	I'm going to spotlight something I think Nintendo does very well.
4179920	4182240	I think Nintendo does DLC very well.
4182240	4186720	I think they are almost ahead of almost any other company I
4186720	4190160	can think of off the top of my head when it comes to DLC and
4190160	4193040	the robustness and the richness and the quality of what you
4193040	4193760	get in DLC.
4194720	4199200	And we know that Mario Kart 8 is getting a lot of DLC lately,
4199200	4204800	and they're getting a new booster course pass with Wave 3
4204800	4205760	is coming out.
4205760	4209200	And Wave 3 of the booster course pack will include the
4209200	4213280	Rock Cup and the Moon Cup, which includes London Loop from
4213280	4217520	Mario Kart Tour, Boo Lake from GBA, Rock Rock Mountain from
4217520	4221280	3DS, Maple Treeway from the Wii, and then the Moon Cup is
4221280	4224080	Berlin Byways, also from Mario Kart Tour.
4224080	4226480	I'm glad Mario Kart Tour can do something for the franchise,
4226480	4228480	because it's single handedly.
4228480	4230320	I think every track for that game is going to end up in this
4230320	4230820	DLC.
4231600	4236400	Peach Gardens from the DS, Merry Mountain, which was also
4236400	4240080	from Mario Kart Tour, and Rainbow Road, the 3DS version.
4241280	4243600	So if you don't already have the booster course pass, you
4243600	4245360	can get that for 25 bucks.
4245360	4248160	And that is for all six sets, 48 new tracks.
4248960	4253040	This particular set will be coming out December 7th, so
4253040	4254240	pretty soon.
4254240	4256240	So there it is.
4256240	4257840	Mario Kart 8 DLC.
4257840	4262800	I gotta admit, this is a very typical middle of the pack.
4262800	4265120	I'm not sure if I'm excited about anything in this,
4265120	4266080	particularly.
4266800	4267680	None of these courses.
4267680	4268960	I remember the Maple Treeway.
4268960	4269920	That one was all right.
4269920	4272640	And actually, the Merry Mountain does look pretty cool,
4272640	4274800	because it has a Christmas train that goes through it and
4274800	4275360	stuff.
4275360	4278240	And so it gives me big, like, what was that course on
4278240	4280800	Nintendo 64 that has the train in it?
4280800	4282320	It gives me big that vibes.
4283280	4285920	So it was just in the last DLC.
4285920	4287600	Yeah, I was gonna say that course in the last one.
4287600	4288320	Desert.
4288320	4288820	Yeah.
4289120	4292560	But this one, I'm pretty sure many of you already plunked
4292560	4294800	down the money for the six pack course.
4295760	4298160	These will be new courses to play at your Christmas
4298160	4301840	gatherings and other holiday gatherings, of course, too.
4301840	4303600	I don't want to neglect any other holidays out there.
4304400	4308880	But yeah, I don't think there's nothing in here that jumps
4308880	4310800	to me like, wow, I've got to have that.
4311440	4313200	It's not like Waluigi pinballs in this one.
4313200	4314000	That was in the last one.
4314720	4316560	It's kind of disappointing to like, I get it.
4316560	4318640	Like, and then maybe they're saving it for Mario Kart 9
4318640	4321120	or whatever the case may be, even though they are making
4321120	4323040	like stuff throughout, I think, next year, too.
4323600	4326640	It is disappointing to see that they haven't really made
4326640	4330080	any tracks based off, like Odyssey or anything like that.
4330080	4331600	Like, I think that would be really cool.
4333120	4334560	New tracks is basically what you're saying.
4334560	4335280	You want new tracks?
4335280	4335680	Yeah.
4335680	4335920	Yeah.
4335920	4338320	New tracks, not just porting over everything.
4338320	4342400	We did get one or two new tracks in the first and second pack.
4342400	4346000	I don't know if they were just probably Mario Kart tour.
4346000	4348720	I bet a lot of these new maps are Mario Kart tour maps that
4348720	4351840	got repurposed or they were going to be for tour.
4351840	4354480	And then they decided, no, we're going to move it over here.
4354480	4357920	So but, you know, I have no proof.
4357920	4360160	That's just, you know, old man insight.
4361040	4362000	So, yeah.
4362000	4365920	But yeah, I think we deserve Mario Kart 9.
4365920	4371600	But at this point, I hope Mario Kart 9 is a launch title
4371600	4372560	for the next system.
4372560	4375200	And I would think that would be a hell of a launch title
4375200	4377040	for a successor to the Switch.
4377040	4381040	I think that would be a hell of a launch title, especially
4381040	4383920	if a Zelda game is not going to be ready, which unless you
4383920	4387840	want to buy into the rumors that, you know, I keep wanting
4387840	4391200	to say Breath of the Wild 2, but it has a name now.
4391200	4393520	The Weeping is the Breath of the Wild 2.
4394960	4395440	Oh, my God.
4395440	4396720	I can't remember the name of something.
4396720	4397760	Tears of the Kingdom.
4397760	4402400	Tears of the Kingdom is going to be dual whatever, whatever.
4402960	4404720	But we'll see.
4405520	4405840	Thank you.
4405840	4406480	Thank you, chat.
4407120	4410160	Yes, because that's never, like, backfired on a system ever.
4411040	4412640	A dual release.
4413360	4416400	I mean, Breath of the Wild was a Wii U game.
4417120	4418240	I understand that.
4418240	4420240	And it's probably held back because of that.
4423360	4425680	It's hard to look at a game like Breath of the Wild and say
4425680	4427680	it's held back at all, though, to be honest.
4427680	4431840	Like, that game is still holding up as one of the best games
4431840	4433600	that's on the Switch at this point.
4433600	4434880	So we'll see.
4435440	4435840	All right.
4436480	4437440	Moving on, Loki.
4437440	4440240	So this is cool.
4440880	4445040	Once again, you know, convincing me that maybe I don't need
4445040	4448480	a PlayStation because the games will eventually come to PC,
4448480	4449760	and that may be the case.
4451200	4458400	So as part of, I think, an interview with the Kazunori Yamauchi
4459120	4462400	about the whole 25th anniversary of Gran Turismo,
4462960	4464240	I believe it was asked that,
4464240	4468640	hey, do you see Gran Turismo ever being brought to PC?
4468640	4471200	Because, you know, some of the other Sony franchises,
4471200	4473520	like God of War and Spider-Man, Uncharted, whatnot,
4474560	4475440	have it come to PC.
4476160	4479680	And he actually said, yeah, I do think so.
4480400	4484880	But there's, you know, right now, he says that Gran Turismo
4484880	4487920	is finally, to title is where we get into marketing speak.
4488480	4492960	There are not many platforms that can run in 4K 60 natively.
4492960	4494080	PC can, I'm sorry.
4494960	4498240	So one way we may make that possible is to narrow down
4498240	4498960	the platform.
4498960	4502080	It's not a very easy subject, but of course, we are looking
4502080	4503280	into it and considering it.
4504720	4506720	Dude, a PC can handle that.
4506720	4507440	Come on.
4507440	4511840	I mean, a PC could easily do that, but whatever.
4511840	4515120	I mean, obviously they probably don't have plans right now,
4515120	4517360	but it is certainly something that they'd be open to,
4517360	4517840	I'm sure.
4518560	4520400	So we'll see what the wait.
4520400	4521600	I'd like to play it on PC.
4522240	4525680	Again, my console gaming has gone way down since I got this
4525680	4526320	new PC.
4526320	4528880	I don't even touch everything I would play on Series X.
4528880	4530800	I pretty much play on the desktop.
4530800	4532560	And honestly, PlayStation five again.
4532560	4534240	It's really just about the exclusives.
4534240	4538160	I'm kind of bummed from SC 16 won't come out PC day one,
4538800	4541920	but it is, of course, of course not going to is what it is
4541920	4542480	at this point.
4542480	4543680	I'll get a PlayStation five.
4543680	4546560	Sony's got to pay those or pay for those exclusives, you
4546560	4546880	know?
4546880	4550880	So I mean, it's only fair that they do it, but no one else.
4550960	4553840	Sometime in the next few weeks, it's a holiday project I
4553840	4554080	have.
4554080	4556560	I'm going to be rearranging the space that I do the show
4556560	4559760	from my office because I'm actually going to put a tea.
4559760	4561040	I'm going to move things around.
4561040	4564320	So I actually have, I don't know how much I can show, but
4564320	4566560	I actually have off to the side where you see the burger
4566560	4567120	time cabinet.
4567120	4569040	There's actually a closet over there.
4569040	4570960	That's like a walk-in closet.
4570960	4574640	I'm actually going to repurpose that walk-in closet as like
4574640	4576000	a mini arcade.
4576000	4579120	So I'm going to move the burger time machine.
4579120	4579360	Great.
4579360	4581280	Now I'm not going to be able to get my camera backwards.
4581280	4584000	I'm going to move the burger time machine into that closet
4585200	4588400	and move some things around so I can get a TV here in the
4588400	4588880	studio.
4592160	4594640	And I'm going to rotate everything to make it happen.
4594640	4597760	So in the new shot for the show, you should hopefully see
4598480	4601840	the burger or the burger time machine and maybe future
4601840	4603120	expansion machines.
4603120	4603600	We'll see.
4603600	4607200	We'll see behind me on the stream in the closet.
4607200	4608320	That's the goal anyway.
4609440	4610880	I'm not going to be able to get this camera.
4610880	4611760	Remind me everyone.
4611760	4616080	I'm not allowed to touch the camera during the show.
4618320	4618720	All right.
4619760	4620080	Sorry.
4620080	4621200	This is terrible radio.
4621200	4621920	Help me, Loki.
4622880	4623360	All right.
4623360	4624320	I think we're good.
4624320	4624800	All right.
4624800	4625040	Good.
4625040	4625600	Just in time.
4627040	4627760	Looking in chat.
4627760	4628160	Yeah.
4628160	4629760	Rollercoaster ride on Rob's cam.
4629760	4630000	Yeah.
4630000	4630400	Sorry.
4630400	4633360	Sorry to do that live, but I wanted to show that and I want
4633360	4635360	to get TV in here so I can do console gaming and that'll
4635360	4638320	make it also easy to stream more console games from in here.
4639040	4640560	If I want to do that.
4640560	4642240	So which I probably do.
4642800	4643520	All right.
4643520	4644240	Moving on.
4644240	4646640	Let's talk about a console classic.
4646640	4648400	The Xbox 360.
4648400	4649360	Yes, that's a classic.
4649360	4654080	Now, actually, what's also classic about this.
4654080	4657760	And I want to thank Matt and our discord over at vognetwork.com
4657760	4658480	slash discord.
4658480	4661120	That's vognetwork.com slash discord for bringing the story
4661120	4661920	to our attention.
4661920	4664560	And that is that the company that brought back the Duke
4664560	4670240	controller that was the large concussion enabling Xbox
4670240	4673520	controller that was on the original Xbox, the company that
4673520	4676880	brought this back is going to now bring back the Xbox 360
4676880	4677600	controller.
4677600	4681920	Hyperkin is the company and Xenon is the Xbox 360 controller
4681920	4686080	replica for the Xbox and PC.
4686800	4689280	It is an officially licensed replica of the controller,
4689280	4689760	believe it or not.
4689760	4691120	So that's what makes this notable.
4691120	4692000	What'd you say, Loki?
4692560	4694000	I said it's not different.
4694000	4696880	Like the Xbox 360 controller has been the controller for
4696880	4697280	the last.
4697280	4697600	I know.
4698160	4699680	That's kind of where I was ending up with.
4699680	4704240	This is that honestly, y'all honestly, just get no disrespect
4704240	4704880	to Hyperkin.
4704880	4706320	I'm sure they're doing fine work.
4706320	4709040	Just get a fucking Xbox Series X controller and use it on
4709040	4709600	your PC.
4709600	4710640	Like, it's great.
4710640	4712320	I do it all of the time.
4712320	4715200	Yeah, I literally have my controller right here.
4715200	4717120	And you'll notice it's plugged in because you can do that
4717120	4719840	through a standard USB port.
4719840	4723680	And I play dead by daylight with my controller and other
4723680	4725120	things to vampire survivors.
4725120	4730000	I play on the controller, so it's very, very easy to do.
4730000	4731280	Yeah, I kind of feel this.
4731280	4732480	You'll see the point.
4732480	4733200	Where's the Duke?
4733200	4736160	I understand because that's a completely different design
4736160	4736800	for the controller.
4736800	4741760	But like, this has been the standard for years now.
4741760	4742400	Yeah.
4742400	4745200	Now, just keep in mind the controller is being made with
4745200	4747120	the Series X and S in mind.
4747120	4749920	So the start and the back buttons, they were replaced some
4749920	4752080	time ago with menu and view.
4752080	4754640	So those are now mapped that way.
4754640	4756960	And then there is still a share button in the middle of
4756960	4757920	the controller.
4757920	4761040	I don't think it was that on the original 360.
4761040	4765200	I think it was something else because the X button was still
4765200	4765840	a button.
4765840	4767280	But yeah, I think the share button is new.
4767280	4769040	So they just kind of added that there in the middle of the
4769040	4770400	controller, but doesn't really get in the way.
4772320	4773120	So there you go.
4773120	4774320	That is something available.
4774320	4778000	But again, get a Series X controller to be honest.
4778000	4780800	Zen Monkey says, what Xbox controller works with the PC?
4780800	4781280	All of them.
4782000	4784480	If you still have a working 360 controller, you can plug
4784480	4784880	that in.
4785760	4789600	Not all games may use it natively, but most will.
4790560	4794640	And then especially Xbox One and Series X, you can use any
4794640	4794960	of them.
4795680	4797600	So yeah, I just like 360.
4797600	4801520	You have to be careful because if you want to use a wireless
4801520	4803680	one, you have to have a dongle for that.
4804640	4807280	That's the only thing because those weren't Bluetooth back
4807280	4807680	in the day.
4808240	4809920	Wired, it should work just fine.
4811200	4815200	But anything like Xbox One and newer, it's all compatible.
4815200	4816000	It's all the same.
4816000	4816500	Yeah.
4816960	4819680	So and then I noticed in chat, they're talking about the D
4819680	4820480	pad on the three.
4820480	4826880	I didn't love the D pad on the 360, but I think the one on
4826880	4828560	the Series X is way better.
4828560	4830400	But I guess your mileage may vary.
4830400	4832640	You're welcome to your opinion on whatever one you prefer.
4832640	4834720	And that might be the reason why somebody wants to kind of
4834720	4837360	go back to that classic 360 feel.
4837360	4838640	So there you go.
4839520	4840000	All right.
4840000	4842320	Let's get to our next segment.
4843040	4844640	We're going to do the classic game of the week.
4844640	4845920	I'm going to play the bump here.
4845920	4850000	And as promised, Loki is picking this week because Dark
4850000	4851840	Soccer is still not here and I picked last week.
4851840	4854880	So it's only fair that Loki gets to do this week's game.
4854880	4857200	But first, let's do the lovely introduction.
4857200	4870720	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where
4870720	4874320	I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell
4874320	4875200	you about it.
4875200	4878400	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4878400	4880320	And tonight's pick is so good.
4880320	4882000	Loki, what did you pick?
4883120	4885120	So I picked Sneak King.
4885440	4889840	This is a game for the Xbox 360 and actually the original
4889840	4893520	Xbox, because both consoles would play the same disc.
4893520	4894320	It was great.
4894320	4895040	It was an average.
4895040	4896880	A lot of people didn't know that because the box looked
4896880	4898160	like 360, right?
4898160	4899680	Yeah, because it was.
4899680	4900480	It was.
4900480	4904080	Yeah, it's it actually says on the box that you can do that.
4904080	4905280	And it was kind of neat.
4905280	4907440	And I think it did try it and it actually works, too.
4907440	4908000	It's pretty cool.
4909280	4914000	But it is it was an advert game that was one of three that
4914800	4922080	they released during 2006, and it was developed by Blitz
4922080	4922880	Games.
4922880	4925600	And this was a promotion that actually, funny enough,
4925600	4928800	happened right around the same time in 2006 between November
4928800	4930720	19th and the 24th.
4930720	4934800	Blitz Game, also Blitz Game Studios, I should say.
4934800	4939040	They're also known for some other games, including the Fairly
4939040	4942960	Odd Parents, SpongeBob SquarePants, but also Close to
4942960	4946000	To Our Hearts, the Karaoke Revolution games.
4946720	4947360	Oh, wow.
4947360	4949360	I did not realize they did those games.
4949360	4950000	How funny.
4950000	4951600	They they did those games.
4951600	4952160	That's right.
4952160	4958880	So the game has you playing the king, the mascot of Burger
4958880	4962960	King, and you're tasked with sneaking around creepily and
4962960	4965680	delivering four different types of Burger King meals to
4965680	4966560	hungry people.
4967200	4970800	And it had different levels like the sawmill, the cul de
4970800	4975680	sac, construction zone, downtown, different unique
4975680	4978960	characters and challenges that were in there.
4978960	4983840	There's also a two game modes, free play and challenge.
4983840	4988880	Free play had you actually undertaking different challenges
4988880	4992880	and then I guess you could and you could also explore the
4992880	4995360	area without noise or site detection.
4995360	4998240	So it was kind of a little bit easier to play that.
4998240	5000240	And then, of course, challenge mode was like the full game
5000240	5003520	there. It was great.
5003520	5004480	I love this game.
5004480	5007920	So I bought all three.
5007920	5009040	I don't know where they are.
5009040	5013840	The only one I think I saw, I had like Pocket Bike Racing
5013840	5015200	was one of the ones that they did.
5015200	5016880	And also Big Bumpin was a big bump.
5016880	5020800	And I remember that one because the Pocket Bike racing had
5020800	5024880	some conventionally attractive lady on the front cover.
5024880	5026800	And like the Burger King characters were all relegated to
5026800	5027360	the back.
5027360	5027920	Like, what was that?
5028000	5032720	I was like a really not great target.
5032720	5035200	I don't remember, you know, stereo audience.
5035200	5038480	I think it was actually like a person on there.
5038480	5039040	Oh, was it?
5040640	5042880	I just was looking at the footage of Sneak King.
5042880	5045520	I love the way the King walks in this game.
5045520	5049360	This was actually in my top 10 for 2006 games.
5049360	5052480	I remember we did a thing on the show and I remember my
5052480	5055280	big controversial pick was this game in my number 10 slot
5055280	5059280	because it is absolutely one of the best adver games ever.
5059280	5061040	It was four dollars.
5061040	5062160	It was four dollars.
5062800	5065120	Like, name a game that has that good a value.
5065120	5066800	Okay, Vampire Survivors, name another.
5067520	5068560	It was still worth it.
5068560	5070000	It was still worth it.
5070000	5073840	You know, I honestly and they had talked about it.
5073840	5077680	I think doing like another line of these games as well for
5077680	5079360	like the Xbox one or something like that.
5080000	5081120	I really wish they would.
5081120	5082480	I wish they were free.
5082480	5084080	I would buy them up instantly.
5084640	5086160	They were just ridiculous.
5086160	5087760	And I was trying to explain to my kids.
5087760	5088640	It was yesterday.
5088640	5091520	Like we went to Burger King, actually, or Friday.
5091520	5093920	I think we went to Burger King and like did all that.
5093920	5096160	And I was trying to explain to them that they made games
5096160	5097600	based off of this stuff.
5097600	5097840	Wow.
5097840	5100240	But again, trying to explain to them what Sneak King was.
5100880	5102960	And it's it's just funny.
5102960	5105040	But yeah, and I'm sure your kids are like,
5105040	5109040	Dan, this is not as funny as you think it is.
5109600	5111600	Oh, it's absolutely just as funny.
5112480	5114960	But yeah, like the little flourishes you can do
5114960	5115920	and stuff in the game.
5115920	5116880	It was fantastic.
5118640	5121520	But yeah, unfortunately, they never did, you know,
5121520	5123760	end up doing sequels for this.
5123760	5126480	But I think it was certainly well received.
5126480	5129920	I don't know what the sales were on this, but I got to admit,
5129920	5131200	like, I think, oh, here we go.
5131200	5131700	Here we go.
5132720	5139120	So apparently the this is yeah, the games were oh, was $4.
5139120	5141920	So $3.99 and came with the Burger King meals.
5141920	5147280	And then they said in they sold 2.7 million copies
5147280	5148400	during the promotion.
5148400	5151600	And it was also reported that they said 3.2 million copies
5151600	5154960	were sold, although there is like different numbers.
5154960	5158320	So somewhere around 3 million copies of these games are sold.
5159120	5160080	That's crazy.
5160080	5160720	That's incredible.
5161600	5164160	GameSpot gave it a 5.8 out of 10.
5165120	5165760	IGN.
5166720	5168960	I don't know what they gave the game for that,
5169760	5170320	but yeah, it's funny.
5171040	5172080	Who cares what they thought?
5173680	5175200	They didn't even have to go to Burger King.
5175200	5176480	They were probably sent the games.
5176480	5179520	They didn't have to, you know, eat a mediocre burger
5179520	5182800	and questionable french fries to, you know, get this product.
5182800	5183520	So who cares?
5183520	5187120	Adam Sessler gave it a one out of five.
5187120	5187600	Who cares?
5188160	5191360	I don't care because this game is a number one out of five.
5191360	5191920	In my heart.
5191920	5192420	That's right.
5192960	5196000	And that is why it is the classic game of the week.
5196000	5196960	Well said.
5197840	5198880	Classic game of the week.
5198880	5201840	Sneak King, the Xbox 360.
5201840	5204240	Again, another one of those titles where I remember talking
5204240	5205920	about this game when it was new.
5205920	5210800	And here we are 16 years later revisiting it back.
5210800	5211680	It's a classic game.
5212240	5213200	Burger King.
5213200	5215200	We need you to remaster these games.
5215200	5215600	Come on.
5216160	5218000	We got to bring it to modern consoles again.
5219520	5220240	Just sneaking.
5220240	5221600	We don't have to worry about the other ones,
5221600	5224320	but like just sneaking, maybe a sneak king too.
5224320	5227840	And then, like, a couple other, you know, we do a sports game.
5227840	5228560	Bigger bumping.
5229520	5230080	Bigger bumping.
5233280	5233760	All right.
5233760	5236080	Let's check out some rapid fire news.
5236080	5238080	Some other quick headlines in our industry.
5238080	5240720	We'll get to release dates, a few more stories, and then
5240720	5241600	maybe some calls.
5241600	5243360	We'll see if anyone wants to call in tonight.
5244240	5245200	Let's move on, though.
5245200	5246720	We do have some rapid fire news to get to.
5246720	5248080	Just a few quick headlines for you.
5249360	5252320	So I'm not a player of this game, but I've definitely seen
5252320	5254480	a lot of people play Disney Dreamlight Valley.
5254480	5258240	And apparently on December 6, you are going to be able to
5258240	5260480	play in the Toy Story realm.
5260480	5262000	So it's pretty cool.
5262000	5264960	They're going to have Buzz and Woody in there.
5264960	5267920	And I think they even have the bedroom as well, or at least
5268480	5270160	some cosmetics that are from all that.
5270160	5272560	So that's pretty cool to see that come into the game.
5272560	5274320	So check that out very soon.
5275200	5277360	And then this is kind of neat.
5277360	5281760	The Tetris, the Grandmaster is finally coming to consoles.
5281840	5286320	Thanks to that wonderful Arcade Archives series.
5286320	5290640	So you'll be able to play that pretty soon with all the
5290640	5293040	wonderful features that you would expect from the game.
5293040	5298560	Almost 1000 levels and introducing the 20G mechanic.
5300480	5302720	So, yeah, that'll be coming out very soon.
5303440	5303840	Excellent.
5304480	5306880	One quick headline I have for you in rapid fire news is
5306880	5307920	about No Man's Sky.
5307920	5309120	You know, I love this game a lot.
5309120	5310000	I talk about it a lot.
5310720	5314000	Patch 4.06 was released this week, and it included the
5314000	5316240	Nintendo Switch, which is great because there's been some
5316240	5318160	complaints about some performance things on the Switch.
5318160	5319200	What a shock, right?
5319200	5321680	But apparently, actually, the performance stuff aside,
5321680	5324160	apparently the game does run very well on the Switch, like
5324160	5326240	way better than people anticipated it to.
5326240	5329680	I haven't played it firsthand, so I can't say, but most people
5329680	5331840	I know that are playing on the Switch are pleased with it.
5331840	5336560	So, yeah, that's why we're saying they can get No Man's
5336560	5338880	Sky to run on the Switch and look pretty good.
5338880	5339760	Yeah, I know.
5340240	5340320	I know.
5341280	5341600	All right.
5342720	5343760	Enough said.
5343760	5346560	But yeah, so I'm not going to read every bullet in this
5346560	5349200	because a lot of it is just bug fixes, especially when it
5349200	5351200	caused, like, broken loops and things like that.
5351200	5354560	And, you know, menus that didn't go to where they were
5354560	5356960	supposed to go under certain conditions and things like
5356960	5359040	that. So it's mostly a bug fix.
5359040	5362000	But what I will mention with the No Man's Sky update is that
5362000	5365520	they are repeating something they did last year, and that
5365520	5367680	is the Expedition Encore.
5367680	5372800	So if you missed Expeditions 5, 6, 7, or 8, you can play
5372800	5375600	those again right now, at least the first one.
5375600	5380000	So Expedition 5 is live right now, and you can run that,
5380000	5384320	I believe, through December 11th.
5384320	5386480	Don't quote me on that date because I neglected to bring
5386480	5387600	up the calendar right in front of me.
5388480	5390320	But they're going to be running each of them for about
5390320	5390880	two weeks.
5390880	5393600	Me personally, I still need to finish 7 and 8.
5393600	5396000	So I will be participating in this as well because I did
5396000	5396960	not finish 7 or 8.
5396960	5398640	I finished all the others, but not those two.
5399520	5401120	So I'm going to go back and do this.
5401120	5404800	This is also great for those of you that just started on
5404800	5406080	the Nintendo Switch.
5406080	5409360	Like, I believe Mich, if she's out there, she started on
5409360	5410720	the Nintendo Switch.
5410720	5414000	So the Nintendo Switch fan base never got a chance at these.
5414000	5416400	So this is a good chance for y'all to catch up.
5416400	5419440	So that's pretty nice as well that is available.
5420560	5422160	So check that out.
5423280	5425440	Quest Buster says I should try to get the Living Freighter.
5425440	5426240	It's so weird.
5426240	5428240	The weird thing is, I don't remember ever getting that,
5428240	5429600	but I beat number 5.
5431200	5437120	I went to, you know how I know, is I went to the Space Anomaly
5437760	5440240	and I looked at all the unredeemed rewards and they were
5440240	5441280	all for 7 or 8.
5441280	5442320	But now y'all had me worried.
5442320	5445920	I feel like I thought I beat 5, but maybe not.
5445920	5447920	Quest Buster does point out there's probably a billion
5447920	5449120	base shortcuts to help.
5449120	5449760	Absolutely.
5449760	5453280	But sometimes be careful because sometimes for the encores,
5453280	5454880	they mix up the starting point.
5454880	5456640	They mix up the starting planet.
5456640	5460960	They did that last year with 3, the one that was like you
5460960	5464480	did 90% of the expedition on a singular planet.
5464480	5465840	It was a very different way to play the game.
5466880	5468800	They mixed up the planet for the encores.
5468800	5469600	So be careful.
5469600	5471440	The encores are usually a little different because they
5471440	5473280	run in a tighter time frame.
5473280	5474560	So they have to change some things.
5474560	5477760	I'm very curious how that roguelike expedition, which was
5477760	5478160	bad.
5478160	5480160	I'm not going to just because I enjoy the game.
5480160	5481360	I'm not going to make excuses.
5481360	5482640	That was a bad expedition.
5482640	5484480	I'm very curious to see how they're going to adjust that
5484480	5487200	for the two week window, but we'll see because I have to
5487200	5489360	beat it if I want to keep my streak up.
5489360	5489920	So we'll see.
5490800	5492480	All right, moving on.
5493680	5495520	Let's check out some release dates.
5495520	5498640	If any, I imagine this week is going to be very slow as
5498640	5499920	will be the trend through the rest of the year.
5499920	5500400	But let's see.
5500400	5500800	Let's see.
5500800	5503440	How about release dates around the world, starting in the
5503440	5504160	US things.
5504960	5509920	So we've got, let's see, soccer story, which is coming out

5581040	5585120	The Walking Dead Saints and Sinners Chapter 2 Retribution
5585120	5587680	on PC and PlayStation 4.
5589680	5591280	Really long title for the week.
5591280	5592080	Yu-Gi-Oh!
5592080	5593040	Rush Duel!
5593040	5594800	Dawn of the Battle Royale!
5594800	5595840	Let's Go!
5595840	5596560	Go Rush!
5598400	5599120	Nintendo Switch.
5599760	5604560	The Kalisto Protocol on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,
5604560	5606400	Xbox One, Xbox Series.
5607280	5610000	Early leaks are showing that that game is really buggy too,
5610000	5614000	but it is very common for review and pre-release things
5614000	5615520	to still have a lot of bugs.
5615520	5618960	So we do want to be mindful that that game is not in its
5618960	5619440	final state.
5619440	5623680	There will be a day one patch as there is for any big game
5623680	5624320	at this point.
5624960	5625460	Yeah.
5625760	5630160	Marvel's Midnight Suns on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
5631120	5634720	And then last but not least, Need for Speed Unbound on PC,
5634720	5637440	PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
5637440	5637920	That's it.
5637920	5639520	All right, going to Japan.
5639520	5642000	We have a busy week on the Nintendo Switch.
5642000	5644560	Again, the holidays fluctuate a little different in Japan.
5644560	5647280	So we do have this week on December 1st.
5647280	5648240	Shinigami!
5648240	5652480	Shibito Magire comes out on the Switch, as does Windstorm,
5653360	5655360	Samurai Maiden, also released in Japan.
5655920	5659920	River City Girls 1 and 2 in a multi-language edition,
5659920	5661600	so you can run it in multiple languages.
5661600	5663120	Also comes out in Japan.
5663120	5663840	Yu-Gi-Oh!
5663840	5666000	Rush Duel, Dawn of the Battle Royale,
5666000	5668400	the same thing that Loki just pointed out,
5668400	5669920	is obviously coming out in Japan as well.
5669920	5671680	Those games are big over there too.
5671680	5674640	Rune Factory 4 gets a re-release and a price reduction
5674640	5675140	version.
5675840	5678320	SIFU gets a release in Japan this week,
5678320	5681680	also in a multi-language version.
5681680	5683840	The Capcom Belt Action Collection,
5683840	5685520	that's like the fighting game collection,
5685520	5687920	that comes out in Japan in a price reduction.
5687920	5690160	So it's already been out there, but it's price reduced.
5690880	5693200	This game is only out in English, which is interesting.
5693200	5695360	It's called Let's Play Oink Games.
5695360	5697760	And you might think, oh, is it a pig game?
5697760	5700160	No, it's like a brand of like card and board games.
5700160	5702720	So it actually is kind of like a Clubhouse Games type of thing,
5702720	5705440	but around one company's games.
5705440	5708000	Deep Sea Adventure, Startups, Moon Adventure,
5708000	5709040	This Face, That Face,
5709040	5710560	those are some of the games that are available in that.
5710560	5712080	So I thought that was kind of an interesting one,
5712080	5713920	because I had not heard of that before,
5713920	5715680	but maybe some of you in chat have.
5716240	5720080	Going to the PlayStation 5, we have Samurai Maiden
5720080	5721600	is also out on the PlayStation 5,
5721600	5723360	River City Girls 1 and 2,
5723360	5725040	Dakar Desert Rally is out,
5725040	5727200	as well as Session Skate Sim.
5727840	5731120	And that's it for the PlayStation 5 this week in Japan.
5731120	5732560	Since Dark Sakura's not here,
5732560	5734400	perhaps Loki will take us to Europe tonight.
5735200	5737920	Yeah, we have the Doctor Who Duel Bundle
5737920	5740800	that's on PlayStation, Xbox, and the Switch.
5741360	5744000	Astro Knight on PlayStation and the Switch.
5744640	5748000	We have new Joe and Mac Caveman Ninja
5748640	5751840	on PlayStation and the Switch.
5751840	5756640	The Kalisto Protocol on PlayStation and Xbox series.
5757280	5761680	We've got Midnight Suns on PlayStation and Xbox.
5762640	5766000	Last Days of Lazarus on PlayStation.
5766000	5768720	And let's see, Need for Speed Unbound
5768720	5770400	on PlayStation and Xbox.
5771200	5773920	And a few more here.
5773920	5778960	Cobra Kai 2 Dojo's Rising on PlayStation, Xbox, and the Switch.
5780000	5783520	And we've got the Eternal Cylinder on PlayStation,
5783520	5784320	and then that's it.
5786400	5789200	All right, let's do a few more headlines.
5789200	5791520	We have four more stories before the show is done tonight,
5791520	5795120	but we are willing to take your calls and your emails.
5795200	5797520	Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com,
5797520	5800240	although I don't think I saw any for this week, unfortunately.
5801040	5802480	But we always welcome your emails.
5802480	5804480	Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com.
5804480	5806080	We'll see if we get any calls tonight as well
5806080	5808080	over on Discord in our green room.
5808080	5809840	For now, we have some more stories for you,
5809840	5810560	starting with Loki.
5811440	5816320	Yes, so the Sims 4's gallery has been updated
5816320	5821120	to enhance its profanity filter.
5821120	5824000	So there's been some instances they say
5824080	5826480	our wholly unacceptable content has been uploaded
5826480	5828320	to the Sims 4 gallery.
5828320	5831040	This is our team has reviewed and made critical updates
5831040	5834640	to the profanity filter to prevent this
5834640	5836480	from happening in the future.
5836480	5839360	We are grateful for the community's vigilance
5839360	5842160	in helping us identify these inappropriate uploads
5842160	5844480	so we can maintain a safe, creative environment
5844480	5845280	for our players.
5846400	5849920	And so, yeah, get your smut off of there.
5850000	5854720	There's other places for that.
5855600	5856400	That's right, Reddit.
5856400	5857440	We went over that earlier.
5857440	5861120	All right, moving on.
5861120	5864800	You may not have heard of this company, Onoma,
5865600	5869680	but Onoma was Square Enix Montreal.
5869680	5872240	But, you know, some studios changed hands and things.
5872240	5875520	So Onoma has announced that they will be shutting down service
5875520	5877280	for four of their mobile games,
5877280	5882240	including Hitman Sniper The Shadows, Deus Ex Go.
5882240	5883360	Is that like Pokemon Go?
5884480	5885600	I have no idea.
5885600	5888560	No, I think that's like that Hitman Go
5888560	5889760	or something like that.
5889760	5891840	I think, remember the mobile games that they have
5891840	5892480	that were kind of...
5892480	5893920	Well, there's Hitman Sniper is one game,
5893920	5895280	and then Deus Ex Go is another game.
5896080	5896800	And I'm just joking.
5896800	5897600	Is that Pokemon Go?
5897600	5898400	I don't think it is at all.
5898400	5899680	I think this is just go because it's mobile.
5900320	5904560	Arena Battle Champions and Space Invaders Hidden Heroes.
5904560	5906800	They are all going to be removed from the app store
5906880	5908960	in the Android store on December 1st.
5908960	5911040	So this is like literally your last chance to grab it.
5911840	5915440	All the in-game purchases have been stopped on January 4th.
5915440	5917840	You won't be able to play any of those games anymore.
5917840	5920080	No refunds, all sales final.
5920720	5923920	So whereas some companies, Stadia, refunded all the money,
5925360	5928080	Onoma already spent it, so they will not be refunding it.
5928880	5930560	And you can see more in an official tweet
5930560	5932640	that they published over at Studio Onoma.
5933680	5935280	Square Enix Montreal, of course,
5935840	5938000	they were originally founded in 2011.
5938000	5939840	They mainly focused on mobile games,
5941120	5942880	but they did have a pretty dedicated audience
5942880	5946320	with these strategy games like Hitman, Tomb Raider, Deus Ex.
5946320	5947440	But of course, as we know,
5947440	5949440	Embracer Group picked out the studio,
5949440	5953360	and they're not saying that these games are unloading
5953360	5954560	because of this exchange.
5955520	5957200	You could probably infer that.
5957200	5960240	But yeah, so Onoma is now the name of the studio,
5960240	5961680	but it was Square Enix Montreal.
5961680	5963760	So if you played any of those games,
5963760	5964560	sorry for your loss.
5966160	5967920	Uh, let's move on.
5967920	5970240	And just a couple more stories, Loki.
5971360	5974960	Yeah, so Rockstar Games is basically tightening up
5974960	5977440	some of the rules that they have for role-playing servers
5978240	5980400	within Grand Theft Auto Online.
5980400	5982800	And this is not necessarily going to get rid
5982800	5984160	of role-play servers per se,
5984160	5987440	but it's more to crack down on NFTs
5987440	5989440	and people pushing crypto,
5990560	5992400	different loot box sponsorships.
5992400	5993600	Because of course they are.
5995440	5999840	Yeah, so apparently it says it doesn't,
6000880	6004400	right now the rules don't address
6004400	6006320	or directly address virtual currencies,
6006320	6008880	loot boxes, sponsorships, crypto, and NFTs,
6009680	6012080	but they're bringing the existing single-player
6012080	6013840	PC mod rules into play.
6014400	6017200	So basically trying to,
6020480	6022880	they made the comment was that they're an extension
6022880	6024880	of a rich array of community-created experiences
6024880	6025920	within Grand Theft Auto.
6025920	6028800	We hope that those continue to thrive in a safe
6028800	6030880	and friendly way for many years to come.
6030880	6034800	But, you know, obviously they're trying to stop people
6034800	6037120	from selling stuff within their games.
6037120	6040960	I would imagine like maybe even out of game content,
6040960	6043040	you know, selling different things with that.
6044320	6045920	You know, basically saying that, you know,
6045920	6048800	licensed music, sponsorship deals,
6048800	6050160	loot boxes and stuff like that.
6050160	6053360	You can't buy loot boxes, only shark cards.
6054160	6059040	No loot boxes, only the officially sanctioned stuff.
6061040	6063600	But yeah, so they've updated their policy,
6063600	6064720	basically saying that, yeah,
6066000	6068000	misuse of Rockstar Games trademarks
6068000	6069520	and game intellectual property,
6071760	6075120	importation or misuse of other IPs is not allowed,
6076640	6080000	real-world brands, characters, trademarks, and music,
6080000	6082960	commercial exploitation, including the sale of loot boxes
6082960	6087040	for real-world currency or an in-game equivalent,
6087040	6090160	the sale of virtual currencies, generating revenue
6090160	6093760	via corporate sponsorships or in-game integrations,
6093760	6097040	or the use of cryptocurrencies, crypto assets,
6097040	6100960	making new game stories, missions, or that.
6100960	6103840	I can't make new game stories and missions and maps.
6103840	6106320	Well, you probably can't turn around and sell them.
6106320	6108400	I imagine it's the big thing they're trying to prevent.
6108400	6110160	I think as long as you don't sell it.
6110320	6112800	Cracking down on bringing Grand Theft Auto IV
6112800	6114160	into the five engines, stuff like that.
6115280	6115780	Yep.
6116240	6119440	So they're just cracking down on a few more things.
6120640	6121680	All right.
6121680	6125200	Well, is that going to get you to play Grand Theft Auto online
6125200	6126640	if you know it's going to be NFT3?
6127920	6131200	No, I wasn't playing it when it was NFT3.
6131200	6134800	So no, that ship is sale.
6134800	6136400	It's going to be Grand Theft Auto VI
6136400	6138000	is what I'm going to be waiting for.
6138000	6138640	All right.
6138640	6141120	And hopefully, hopefully we get that sooner rather than later.
6141120	6143920	But, you know, let's not hold our breath, shall we?
6143920	6146080	Maybe at the Game Awards, we'll see.
6149040	6151680	By the way, unfortunately, this year at VOG Network,
6151680	6153440	we're not going to be doing a simulcast for that.
6154080	6155840	Bobby Black Wolf is going to be out of town.
6155840	6158240	And I actually agreed to host another show that night.
6158240	6159680	I'm going to guest on another show that night
6159680	6161600	because the usual host is going to be out.
6161600	6165280	So unfortunately, no co-stream.
6165280	6168320	Loki, if you want to co-stream, you can do your Loki stream.
6169120	6171440	Yeah, unfortunately, nothing official here at VOG,
6171440	6172400	unless Loki does it.
6172400	6174640	I have to see what time it is.
6174640	6177040	4.30 Pacific, I believe is when it starts.
6177040	6179200	But it's probably one of those 30-minute pre-shows.
6179920	6180960	Well, I would say of nothing,
6180960	6184080	but I do feel like they did actually announce
6184080	6185200	a lot of stuff previously.
6186000	6187440	Anyway, that was a lot.
6187440	6188960	But yeah, it'll be interesting.
6189520	6190020	All right.
6191040	6193520	Last and sadly tonight, you know,
6193520	6196560	the world of pop music lost an icon this week.
6196640	6200160	Irene Cara, who you might recognize as the name behind
6200160	6204160	huge, huge 80s songs, including Fame and Flashdance,
6204160	6206560	passed away this week at the age of 63.
6206560	6208000	And you might be asking,
6208000	6210320	what in the hell does this have to do with video games?
6210320	6212000	And my answer is a lot.
6212000	6212880	Thank you very much.
6212880	6218000	Because remember, we all met playing Dance Dance Revolution.
6218000	6221360	And sure enough, Dance Dance Revolution third mix.
6221360	6222320	There is a cover.
6223120	6224160	Oh, this came through loud.
6224160	6225680	Sorry, I didn't mean for it to be this loud.
6225680	6228960	There's a cover of Flashdance.
6228960	6230960	It's more of a speed mix,
6230960	6233280	as was very popular in that sort of era.
6234240	6239040	But yeah, the speed mix by Magica of Flashdance,
6239040	6240080	what a feeling,
6240080	6242720	sort of exposed a whole new generation to this song.
6242720	6245920	And some people then discovered Irene Cara through that,
6245920	6249200	who I do believe has a co-writing credit on this song.
6249200	6250240	So there is that.
6250240	6252160	Anyway, that's about the most of that song I can play
6252160	6253440	before I get somebody in trouble.
6254160	6256640	But yeah, so Irene Cara obviously has a connection
6256640	6257840	to Dance Dance Revolution,
6257840	6260560	specifically third mix through that song.
6260560	6264720	And if you don't like those songs in the first place,
6264720	6266320	why are you so hateful?
6266320	6268240	Like those are just some amazing songs.
6268240	6270080	You really have to kind of be sad.
6270080	6272720	Like we didn't really hear other songs
6272720	6274000	from her later in her career,
6274640	6277040	but certainly she left her mark on 80s culture.
6277680	6280080	Also, you might know Irene Cara from The Electric Company
6280640	6282240	was where she was originally from.
6282240	6283920	I mean, you specifically,
6283920	6286480	maybe your parents know them from The Electric Company,
6286480	6288400	but she was on that as well.
6288400	6291920	She was in the movies Erin Loves Angela and Sparkle.
6291920	6293840	And of course, we all know Fame,
6293840	6296240	where she starred as Coco Hernandez in that movie.
6296800	6297680	She had the record.
6297680	6300160	She also had Out Here on My Own was a ballad.
6300160	6303280	She was nominated for a Golden Globe and two Grammys.
6303280	6305920	And yes, Cara co-wrote the lyrics to Flashdance,
6305920	6307920	What a Feeling, which was all over.
6307920	6311360	She'd have some other songs later called Why Me and Breakdance.
6312000	6313840	But she'll probably be most well-known
6313840	6317360	for her affiliation with Fame and all of that good stuff.
6317360	6319840	So Dejirama S says Morgan Freeman
6319840	6321120	got his start on The Electric Company,
6321120	6322240	if I recall correctly.
6322240	6325760	Yeah, I think I did see on YouTube a clip of that.
6325760	6328720	So Zen Monkey said I had a major crush on her.
6328720	6330400	Yeah, I know it's sad.
6331360	6333760	Darted Suya says DDR definitely exposed me
6333760	6335360	to a lot of new music.
6335360	6337440	Absolutely, absolutely.
6337440	6339760	And so Irene Cara was one of those greats.
6339760	6341680	So rest in peace.
6342960	6345280	Let's get to the you part of the show
6345280	6346560	where if you want to give us a call,
6346560	6349360	you can join our green room over at vognetwork.com
6349360	6350000	slash Discord.
6350000	6352560	Again, that's vognetwork.com slash Discord.
6352560	6356000	Or you can always send us a message in our chat
6356000	6358720	over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.
6359520	6361040	If you have something you want us to talk about
6361040	6362640	before we sign out for the night,
6362640	6364480	let me check in with Loki.
6364480	6367200	It's kind of a slower week with the US
6367200	6368480	not running for the past three days.
6368560	6370400	But anything you want to throw out here
6370400	6371280	for last minute stories?
6372000	6373040	There's nothing.
6373040	6373360	Yeah.
6373360	6374960	We were scraping at the bottom already.
6374960	6375440	I know.
6375440	6376320	We were kind of...
6376320	6378800	When we're turning Reddit posts into stories,
6378800	6379920	you know it's a slow week.
6379920	6383360	And the same is true of the sites you visit every day.
6383360	6385520	They still got to get clicks in November and December.
6385520	6387840	They got to make those ad folks happy.
6389280	6390560	Have you experimented with any...
6390560	6391280	Let me ask this question
6391280	6392880	because this is something a lot of people are going through.
6392880	6394320	And I promise I'm not going to make this
6394320	6396080	a Twitter hate boner thing.
6396080	6398800	You all know my issues with Twitter and why I deleted.
6398800	6399440	I'm curious.
6399440	6403280	Have you explored any of those alternatives to Twitter
6403280	6404400	right now that are going around?
6404400	6405520	What are your thoughts with all the...
6406720	6408160	I don't want to say Twitter knockoffs
6408160	6410080	because a lot of these things have existed for years.
6410080	6413440	They're just coming to light because of what's going on.
6413440	6414800	But what are your thoughts
6414800	6417520	on some of the Twitter successors maybe?
6418240	6418800	I don't know.
6418800	6422160	I think I set up an account on Mastodon in Hive
6422160	6424880	and that's about it as far as I've gone.
6425200	6426080	You have Hive?
6426080	6427120	Did I add you on Hive?
6428320	6428880	I don't know.
6429680	6431840	I have to find you if I haven't already added you.
6431840	6433280	Yeah, I'm with Matt.
6433280	6434480	I kind of like Hive.
6435120	6437760	I don't love the layout on Hive
6437760	6440080	because it feels more Instagram to me, which is fine.
6440080	6444240	I like Instagram, but the photos take up so much space.
6444240	6448560	One nice thing about Twitter before you know who ruined it
6448560	6450160	was that it was very compact
6450160	6452800	in the way it showed its information on Twitter.
6452800	6454880	And I want Hive to be able to get to that point too
6454880	6457200	where it can show the information on the screen compactly.
6457200	6459600	But Hive's biggest issue right now
6459600	6461600	is that there's no web client for Hive.
6461600	6463840	And that leads to all sorts of accessibility issues
6463840	6467680	for people too, which people are calling out about Hive.
6467680	6470000	But we have to remember it's two people,
6470000	6472240	I think three that run Hive.
6472240	6474640	And it was not intended to be a Twitter replacement.
6474640	6477120	It just kind of is that right now for some people.
6477120	6479360	So y'all got to be patient with Hive
6479360	6481280	and understand many of the issues.
6481280	6482320	They're at least acknowledging it.
6482400	6484240	They're like, yeah, we need to work on accessibility.
6484240	6484720	Okay, cool.
6484720	6485600	They're acknowledging it,
6485600	6486960	but it's not going to be fixed tomorrow.
6487760	6488320	So we'll see.
6488320	6492480	I would be very curious watching all of these people flee
6493200	6496160	if a big backer is going to get in there.
6496160	6501440	I'm really curious if an Amazon, a Google,
6501440	6504320	which would be wild, but I don't put them off the table.
6506320	6507680	Let's come back, baby.
6508480	6511120	I would be very curious if one of these big tech,
6511120	6512960	well, an Apple themselves, who knows?
6514080	6515360	What the fuck was that thing called?
6515360	6516000	Wave?
6516000	6516880	No, that was Google.
6516880	6519440	What was Apple's social media thing that flopped?
6520160	6521840	It flopped hard.
6521840	6523360	I don't want to think about that.
6523360	6528480	Apple, it was built into iTunes at one point and it flopped.
6529280	6532960	But anyway, my point is any one of these companies
6532960	6536000	is going to buy Hive when they see how big it's getting.
6536000	6537440	And it's going to be very interesting.
6537440	6544000	But again, I would much rather welcome Apple taking over Hive.
6544000	6545760	And I'm completely fanficking this.
6545760	6548160	So, you know, insert big tech company here
6548160	6550000	as opposed to what's going on at Twitter right now.
6550800	6554400	I would completely welcome Amazon for God's sake.
6554400	6557840	So Tiger Claw says Apple doesn't have a social media server.
6557840	6558800	They did.
6558800	6559200	They did.
6559200	6562240	It was integrated into iTunes
6562240	6565280	and they tried to get musicians to be on there.
6565280	6567600	And it was a music based social feed.
6567600	6569120	Somebody's going to know what I'm talking about.
6569120	6570160	And then you all are going to know.
6570160	6574640	You all are going to go, oh, yeah, that that came in.
6574640	6576080	It was faster than Google Plus.
6576080	6577040	What the hell is it called?
6584800	6585520	Ping.
6585520	6586560	It was called Ping.
6586560	6587440	iTunes Ping.
6589600	6591360	Orangewrite1 in chat.
6591360	6592320	There it is.
6592320	6593280	iTunes Ping.
6593280	6595040	Yeah, I had to Google it real fast.
6595040	6597280	And they discontinued it in 2012.
6598080	6600080	Ping could be a classic game of the week.
6601840	6604320	That's how long ago Ping went away.
6607600	6611040	But anyway, Hive is going to be interesting.
6611040	6613440	The more and more people that flee to it,
6613440	6616720	the more and more somebody are going to throw those two women.
6616720	6619520	I believe it was two women that started that company.
6619520	6621680	They're going to throw those two women a lot of money.
6621680	6623200	And it's going to be hard to say no to it.
6623520	6624960	It's going to be like the wordle dude.
6625680	6630480	The wordle dude is a great road map for what's about to happen to Hive.
6631360	6632880	The other one is Mastodon.
6632880	6634320	I like Mastodon.
6635600	6638720	I'm well aware of Mastodon's moderation issues
6638720	6640320	and some of the things that have happened over there
6640320	6641600	that need to be worked on.
6642560	6646160	It's a little interesting because it's so decentralized.
6646160	6649920	I also don't think you should be throwing rocks at Mastodon
6649920	6651760	from your Twitter account.
6651760	6655360	When you are on a platform that is literally forgiving Nazis.
6655360	6659520	And again, those of you that are staying on Twitter,
6659520	6660160	I understand.
6660160	6661120	I'm not judging that.
6661120	6666080	I'm judging the people throwing rocks at Mastodon from Twitter.
6666080	6666800	Big difference.
6666800	6667600	I hope you see it.
6668960	6673360	But I think Mastodon, the hardest thing is understanding it
6673360	6674960	and getting the right client.
6674960	6676720	And I finally did get the right client.
6677360	6681040	For me on iOS, the client I use is called,
6681040	6683280	I think it's meta text.
6684640	6685520	So meta text.
6685520	6688480	And once you get that, it looks a lot like Twitter, to be honest.
6688480	6692720	But I actually love that you have a 500 character limit on Mastodon
6692720	6694880	and it flows so much better.
6694880	6698080	You can turn off retuts or whatever they call it.
6698080	6699200	I really like Mastodon.
6699200	6701440	It's just not enough people flocked to it.
6701440	6704160	My feed feels really empty compared to what I had on Twitter.
6704160	6705520	But I knew that was going to happen.
6705520	6706240	It is what it is.
6706960	6708880	I also really like co-host.
6708960	6712000	But co-host has the exact opposite problem of Hive.
6712800	6717520	Co-host only has a web app and no phone app.
6717520	6720240	And to really have a successful social media platform,
6720240	6722480	in my opinion, you need both.
6723440	6724960	So hopefully co-host gets there.
6724960	6727280	Co-host has serious live journal vibes.
6727920	6731760	Serious live journal vibes, but like somehow streamlined.
6731760	6735120	And I see the people that are like building games completely
6735120	6737840	in co-host, which I think is really neat, which I think is
6737840	6739440	what Orange Wright is referencing in chat right there.
6739440	6741760	Because he's the one I see reblogging a lot of that stuff
6741760	6744320	where there's like full on games that are built in co-host.
6744320	6745360	So I like co-host.
6745360	6747680	So I'm on Hive at Rob Roberts.
6748800	6751440	The one nice thing about this is I'm getting to claim my name
6751440	6756400	everywhere before some silly politician in Europe can do it.
6758640	6761440	Because there's that guy that's named Rob and there's the DJ
6761440	6763600	in Australia that's named that, the gun owner.
6763600	6765440	So I'm getting my name before any of these other people
6765440	6766560	that want to claim it.
6766560	6768480	So I'm Rob Roberts on Hive.
6768480	6771040	Rob Roberts at Mastodon.social.
6771040	6772560	And then I'm Rob Roberts on co-host.
6773200	6776800	So I'm all of them.
6776800	6779040	Fifth Dream says, I'm just gonna go back to MySpace.
6779040	6780320	IDGAF.
6780320	6782400	Honestly, I still have a MySpace.
6782400	6783200	There's space.
6783200	6783920	There's space.
6783920	6786800	Hey, Dartusuya was showing that one that there's space.
6786800	6788960	Hey is literally MySpace without Tom.
6788960	6789840	That's it.
6789840	6792480	It's otherwise like literally just a redoing of MySpace.
6793360	6795920	So, all right.
6795920	6798800	No other calls seem to be coming in tonight.
6798800	6799600	So let's yeah.
6799600	6800720	Pod culture, same for me.
6800720	6802400	I go on and I snag my name.
6802400	6804400	That's why I'm like, I don't know which one of these is
6804400	6804960	going to stick.
6805600	6809280	Personally, there's a lot about Hive I like.
6810080	6812000	There's a lot about co-host I like.
6812000	6813440	There's a lot about Mastodon I like.
6813440	6815200	There's things I like in all three of them.
6815200	6816480	I love the fact that Mastodon is decentralized.
6816480	6817920	Just have them all merge together.
6817920	6819840	They can all like become one big company.
6819840	6822480	Well, the Hive and the co-host problem is that somebody
6822480	6823120	could buy them.
6823120	6824400	Nobody can buy Mastodon.
6825040	6828000	That's that's the most fascinating thing about it to me.
6828000	6830560	So because it's decentralized.
6830560	6833520	And now the fact that you have things like Tumblr says
6833520	6835280	they're going to integrate with the Fediverse, which would
6835280	6837680	mean you could get a Tumblr feed on Mastodon.
6837680	6839680	And then another big one came out this week.
6839680	6841680	And one of the photo services said they were going to do
6841680	6842640	it as well.
6842640	6844080	So it could be interesting.
6844080	6847440	Orange writing chat says that's the thing I didn't understand.
6848000	6848720	So pick a server.
6848720	6850560	I'm like, I don't know.
6850560	6851600	Well, it's like email.
6851600	6852800	Do you want Gmail?
6852800	6854080	Do you want Yahoo?
6854080	6855360	It's all email at the end of the day.
6855920	6859360	But your server is going to dictate because, you know,
6859360	6860480	basically who is running it.
6860480	6862800	You do have to trust your server admin to like make the
6862800	6865840	right moderation decisions and block the right servers.
6865840	6868720	That's why Bobby Blackwolf on his show was like, I could
6868720	6871200	make a VoG network Mastodon server.
6871200	6872640	I do not want to run one.
6873200	6876320	And I'm like, honestly, I get it.
6876640	6877520	Say no more.
6877520	6879120	Like you shouldn't have to run.
6879120	6881600	That's a full time job to run a server like that.
6881600	6882720	It takes a lot of work.
6882720	6884880	There'd be too many moderation decisions and things like
6884880	6886800	that. So I get it.
6886800	6887360	I get it.
6888400	6890960	So all right, that's going to do it for tonight's Orange
6890960	6891520	Lounge Radio.
6891520	6893280	I know it's a little bit shorter of a show, but hey, it's
6893280	6893760	a holiday.
6893760	6894320	What can we do?
6895120	6897040	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts and
6897040	6898320	wrap it up for tonight.
6898320	6900240	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,
6900240	6902240	tell a friend or two help us spread the word because we
6902240	6904320	are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need
6904320	6906320	more voices out there to put out there.
6906320	6907760	So tell a friend or two about the show.
6908400	6911840	A nice five star review on iTunes, Spotify, wherever it
6911840	6912880	is you found this show.
6912880	6914160	Those go an awful long way.
6914160	6915200	We need more spot.
6915200	6917680	Even if you don't listen in Spotify, if you have a Spotify
6917680	6919760	account, please look up Orange Lounge Radio rate is five
6919760	6922720	stars. Amazon has a big podcasting thing now, too.
6922720	6923600	And we're in that as well.
6923600	6925200	Rate, rate, rate, five stars.
6925200	6926080	Really appreciate it.
6927840	6930960	I saw, like, was it, I know there's another podcast I
6930960	6934240	listened to that's more Minecraft related called the
6934240	6937440	Wuthering effect, and they do like polls or like ask, have
6937440	6938320	questions and comments.
6938320	6941280	Like if there's actually like comment functionality in
6941280	6944400	Spotify, which I didn't even know was a thing, I'll have
6944400	6945120	to look into it.
6945120	6946640	Yeah, I'm all for doing that.
6946640	6950160	I want to be careful to not because it might be, it might
6950160	6952560	be a Spotify exclusive show, and I don't want to make this
6952560	6957760	show exclusive to anyone platform, but I'll look into it.
6957760	6960320	I would rather they go to vognetwork.com to do the polls,
6960320	6961040	though, so we'll see.
6963120	6965760	All right, that's it.
6965760	6968320	Let's wrap it up and get out of here for the night.
6968320	6969200	Let's get final thoughts.
6969200	6970320	Loki, your final thought tonight.
6971760	6973120	Keep working on Minecraft stuff.
6974560	6975040	Do that.
6975040	6978240	And me, I'm going to try to stream more Pokemon.
6978240	6981040	I'm excited to play more of the game, get some more good
6981040	6984800	stuff, start trading for version exclusives, breeding the
6984800	6989840	dittos, getting three dittos deep on sprigatito clones and
6989920	6990720	so forth.
6990720	6991920	So that's it.
6991920	6993360	Have a great week, everybody.
6993360	6995360	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6995360	6996960	I hope you all have a wonderful night.
6996960	6997360	Good night.
