00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
It may be true that 2D Mario games outsell 3D Mario games, but the same is not true of

00:14.000 --> 00:17.360
Pokemon, as Scarlet and Violet reach 10 million units sold in three days.

00:17.360 --> 00:20.920
It's not all gold and silver, as many gamers have taken up swords and shields to decry

00:20.920 --> 00:22.320
the quality of their beloved game.

00:22.320 --> 00:25.640
They're ready to rumble in the stadium before going home to probably play more.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.440
That's the cycle of the sun and moon.

00:27.440 --> 00:28.440
Legends.

00:28.440 --> 00:29.760
This is the punniest intro I've done.

00:29.760 --> 00:33.240
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about

00:33.240 --> 00:36.160
this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where every

00:36.160 --> 00:38.160
gamer has a voice.

00:38.160 --> 00:43.640
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

00:43.640 --> 00:48.000
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:48.000 --> 00:56.960
It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again for tonight, November the 27th of 2022, episode

00:56.960 --> 00:59.700
number 938 of our show.

00:59.700 --> 01:04.340
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you every week with my co-hosts, well, not

01:04.340 --> 01:06.920
here this week, Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers.

01:06.920 --> 01:09.600
She has the night off as we talked about last week.

01:09.600 --> 01:13.180
She went on a trip for the holidays to go see her mom, who she's talked a lot about

01:13.180 --> 01:14.180
on the show recently.

01:14.180 --> 01:16.960
My understanding is she actually did get back last night.

01:16.960 --> 01:20.820
She just kind of wanted to take tonight off to sort of recover, which I can completely

01:20.820 --> 01:21.820
understand.

01:21.820 --> 01:26.660
I know when I go on a big trip, I need a vacation for my vacation, so she's just going to continue

01:26.660 --> 01:27.660
the night off.

01:27.660 --> 01:31.700
She's going to be joining us again next week back on the program.

01:31.700 --> 01:35.700
Instead, of course, we have, as we have every week, Techmaster Loki.

01:35.700 --> 01:36.700
Hello.

01:36.700 --> 01:37.700
Hi, how are you?

01:37.700 --> 01:38.700
I'm good.

01:38.700 --> 01:39.700
Good, good.

01:39.700 --> 01:43.260
And no third host tonight.

01:43.260 --> 01:48.140
I was out of town myself because with the Thanksgiving holiday in the States, I was

01:48.140 --> 01:51.140
gone for a couple of days because I went to a Friendsgiving.

01:51.140 --> 01:55.340
For those of you that remember the show, Hoard House, my pal, Grandpa, has a murder cabin

01:55.340 --> 01:56.340
up in the woods.

01:56.340 --> 02:03.180
I call it murder cabin because it's a very remote part of the rural California, but it

02:03.180 --> 02:04.180
was great.

02:04.180 --> 02:05.660
We had a nice Friendsgiving celebration.

02:05.660 --> 02:07.980
It was lovely.

02:07.980 --> 02:12.580
But kept me out of town for a couple of days, so I wasn't really thinking about, oh, who

02:12.580 --> 02:15.180
should sit in on OLR this week?

02:15.180 --> 02:19.740
It's just Loki and I holding down the fort tonight with all of you in our chat over at

02:19.740 --> 02:27.440
twitch.tv slash vog network or VOG network because we do tape live every Sunday night

02:27.440 --> 02:32.300
at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the

02:32.300 --> 02:37.340
Voice of Geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

02:37.340 --> 02:42.100
And some folks tonight in chat talking about our little parody bump that opened the show

02:42.100 --> 02:47.980
tonight, which was a riff on Atari 50 and She-Hulk 10 in chat is saying, woohoo, Atari

02:47.980 --> 02:51.500
2600 is the best console ever made.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.260
It certainly is the heaviest.

02:53.260 --> 02:56.460
It certainly is the one that you probably could use in a murder cabin.

02:56.460 --> 03:03.040
No, I obviously I would never endorse that, but Atari 2600 obviously without it, we wouldn't

03:03.040 --> 03:05.580
have a lot of games that we have today.

03:05.580 --> 03:06.580
That's for sure.

03:06.580 --> 03:11.500
Atari 2600 is a legendary console and really one of the first that I remember playing.

03:12.020 --> 03:18.660
SH-100 Matt is noting in chat the video game that is playing behind Loki tonight is Festers

03:18.660 --> 03:26.360
Quest from the Super Nintendo, Nintendo era, which fun fact, Festers Quest in many ways

03:26.360 --> 03:28.640
is Blaster Master 2.

03:28.640 --> 03:34.620
They very much run on the same engine, except Festers Quest is only the overhead sequences

03:34.620 --> 03:38.040
from Blaster Master does not have any of the side scroller and the vampart.

03:38.040 --> 03:41.820
But if you were to take all of the overhead sequences and make a game out of it, you basically

03:41.820 --> 03:43.660
get Festers Quest on the NES.

03:43.660 --> 03:44.660
And some people loved it.

03:44.660 --> 03:45.660
Some people hated it.

03:45.660 --> 03:49.860
And it also, it cracks me up because it's like a lot of the same mechanics, the gun

03:49.860 --> 03:51.180
increasing levels.

03:51.180 --> 03:55.320
Even those little frogs are the same fricking sprites from Blaster Master.

03:55.320 --> 04:00.000
So Festers Quest, like I don't know how Festers Quest and Blaster Master got set in the same

04:00.000 --> 04:01.560
universe, but they very much are.

04:01.560 --> 04:04.680
I just want to point that out.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.520
Were you a fan of Festers Quest back in the day?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Yeah, it was all right.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.200
Yeah, I remember reading a lot of like the walkthroughs in Nintendo Power and stuff like

04:12.200 --> 04:13.200
that.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.200
Yeah.

04:14.200 --> 04:19.220
I got a copy of Festers Quest for Christmas one time.

04:19.220 --> 04:23.480
And it was a Christmas gift I spoiled for myself because my mom had gone to the store.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.320
I don't remember what store she went to.

04:25.320 --> 04:27.160
Some store that doesn't exist anymore.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.920
Probably I want to say it was like KB Toys or something like that.

04:29.920 --> 04:34.700
She went to and there was a bag or she went to the store next to KB Toys, but there was

04:34.700 --> 04:36.200
a shopping bag.

04:36.760 --> 04:39.400
Sometimes I'll be like, oh, what did mom get at the grocery store?

04:39.400 --> 04:41.160
And I look and there's a KB Toys bag in there.

04:41.160 --> 04:42.160
I'm like, oh, why did you go to KB Toys?

04:42.160 --> 04:43.160
And I open it.

04:43.160 --> 04:45.060
There's a copy of Festers Quest in there.

04:45.060 --> 04:47.760
And I put two and two together and I was like, oh shit, that was my Christmas present.

04:47.760 --> 04:52.660
I just saw like, even at the age of like 10, I was like, oops, I wasn't supposed to see

04:52.660 --> 04:53.660
this.

04:53.660 --> 04:57.760
So I put it back and just walked out of the room and pretended I didn't see nothing.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.400
And then on Christmas Day, I act surprised and thankful.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.800
And it's not like I have to play the game early.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.320
I just saw the box sitting there.

05:04.320 --> 05:07.600
So that's, uh, that's my Festers Quest story.

05:07.600 --> 05:11.040
Dardusia says, I know I rented Festers Quest a time or two.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.040
Yeah.

05:12.040 --> 05:15.080
I think everybody, everybody that was gaming in that area had to have played it at some

05:15.080 --> 05:16.080
point.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.080
I'm sure.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.080
Digirama S says it was pretty good.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.080
I enjoyed Festers Quest.

05:19.080 --> 05:23.540
I think I wouldn't say it's like an all time greatest NES game, but I think people give

05:23.540 --> 05:26.160
it more shit than they need to.

05:26.160 --> 05:31.400
And I think when you realize that this game is Blaster Master 2, you kind of go, oh, should

05:31.400 --> 05:33.440
I be talking so much shit about this game?

05:33.560 --> 05:37.160
And this game is probably better than the actual Blaster Master 2 that they put out

05:37.160 --> 05:40.560
on the Genesis years later.

05:40.560 --> 05:41.560
So there is that.

05:41.560 --> 05:42.560
All right.

05:42.560 --> 05:46.560
From the 3D Blaster Master game that they put out on, was it the original PlayStation

05:46.560 --> 05:47.560
or something like that?

05:47.560 --> 05:48.560
Oh yeah.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.440
There was a, or 3D Blaster Master on the original PlayStation.

05:50.440 --> 05:57.320
Then they did a reboot on the Nintendo Wii that was okay, but the physics were off and

05:57.320 --> 05:59.760
you can't have the physics be off in a Blaster Master game.

05:59.760 --> 06:03.640
They have to, they have to feel like the original or the whole game is thrown off.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.400
That was my big problem with it.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.920
But the other, and I know I've mentioned this on the show, but I'll say it again.

06:08.920 --> 06:14.080
The recent Blaster Master Zero reimagining, because they kind of, they didn't really totally

06:14.080 --> 06:15.080
remake it.

06:15.080 --> 06:16.120
They really redid some things.

06:16.120 --> 06:21.400
The Blaster Master Zero, I think is one of the most well done remasters, reimagines,

06:21.400 --> 06:25.880
whatever you want to call it, that they've done of any game of the NES era, to be quite

06:25.880 --> 06:27.720
frankly.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.520
That is probably one of the best.

06:29.520 --> 06:33.160
And they ended up making a whole trilogy out of that, which Blaster Master two and

06:33.160 --> 06:37.500
three, or Blaster Master Zero two and three, I don't think have anything to do with the

06:37.500 --> 06:44.280
original series at all, except they made a character in those games out of a character

06:44.280 --> 06:47.340
that was only in the FX9 books.

06:47.340 --> 06:51.400
The worlds of power books that were based off of NES games from back in the day.

06:51.400 --> 06:56.560
So random, useless, fun fact if you're ever on Jeopardy someday.

06:56.560 --> 06:57.560
Being in chat.

06:57.560 --> 07:00.520
Yeah, Dr. Sia says there's only the Blaster Master Zero trilogy.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.120
Yeah, I would I would actually super recommend that.

07:03.120 --> 07:07.800
SHO 100 Matt says yeah, the AVGN video gave it kind of a bad rap.

07:07.800 --> 07:13.000
I think too many people take that person's opinions and slap like if that guy says this

07:13.000 --> 07:16.440
game is bad, hahaha, then they agree this game is bad.

07:16.440 --> 07:22.160
When it's like I, you know, I'm not going to defend that this is an all time great,

07:22.160 --> 07:24.420
but I think it's better than people give it credit for.

07:24.420 --> 07:25.420
And that's the case.

07:25.420 --> 07:28.060
I'm just gonna say it with a lot of those videos because another one another one I think

07:28.060 --> 07:32.060
it's a lot of shit unnecessarily is the Friday the 13th video game.

07:32.060 --> 07:33.060
Is it?

07:33.060 --> 07:34.060
Is it great?

07:34.060 --> 07:35.060
No, it does.

07:35.060 --> 07:38.660
It has an amazing soundtrack as an incredible soundtrack.

07:38.660 --> 07:42.220
And I like that Jason looks all neon and funky.

07:42.220 --> 07:45.540
Keep in mind that game came out around the time they were making movies like Jason in

07:45.540 --> 07:46.540
space.

07:46.540 --> 07:50.880
I'm sorry, but the Jason in that game is just fine for where the franchise was out at that

07:50.880 --> 07:51.880
time.

07:51.880 --> 07:55.720
And you know, the the character balance is extremely lopsided and there's there's other

07:55.720 --> 07:56.960
issues of that game.

07:56.960 --> 08:01.360
But I don't think Friday the 13th is nearly as bad as people give the rap on that game.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.760
So that's my thought.

08:03.760 --> 08:07.280
And of course, you know, I have a copy.

08:07.280 --> 08:11.960
Well not Fester's Quest, but I have a copy of nice blaster master nice right here on

08:11.960 --> 08:13.480
my computer because perfect.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.340
That's where I store my NES games apparently.

08:15.340 --> 08:19.400
Now that is a game I will defend as an all time great blaster master was extremely underrated

08:19.400 --> 08:20.400
at the time.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.400
And it's an incredible game.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.400
Start to finish.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.400
Yeah.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.400
All right.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.040
Well, we could talk about, you know, the old men could sit here and talk about NES games

08:27.040 --> 08:30.760
all night, but we should probably talk about what else is going on in the industry.

08:30.760 --> 08:35.040
Let's get to our kickoff topic tonight, which has to do with, you know, ever since this

08:35.040 --> 08:39.640
Microsoft and Activision Blizzard merger was announced, we knew this was going to go through

08:39.640 --> 08:41.560
a lot of legal scrutiny.

08:41.560 --> 08:48.840
And we're getting a lot more information that's coming out of statements, filings, Sony's

08:48.840 --> 08:56.720
rebuttal, Microsoft's defense, like this, this is really the what do you call those

08:56.720 --> 08:59.880
agreements?

08:59.880 --> 09:01.080
The name escapes me in the moment.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.760
Of course, now I'm trying to think of it.

09:02.760 --> 09:03.760
Non-disclosure.

09:03.760 --> 09:04.760
Thank you.

09:04.760 --> 09:09.200
This is really the NDA gift that keeps on giving is this whole little merger.

09:09.200 --> 09:13.480
So let's talk about some of the things that came out as a result of this this week, Loki.

09:13.480 --> 09:16.680
It's basically say anything is what it is.

09:16.680 --> 09:22.800
They're just saying whatever they can to try to persuade the government bodies that are

09:22.800 --> 09:26.540
looking at this to persuade them, obviously, one way or the other.

09:26.540 --> 09:33.960
So you have things like where Xbox, you know, Microsoft and the Xbox team are saying, well,

09:33.960 --> 09:38.640
you know, PlayStation exclusives are better than our, you know, exclusive games.

09:38.640 --> 09:44.920
And so it's it's fine that we get, you know, Call of Duty as an exclusive game because,

09:44.920 --> 09:49.680
you know, they have their exclusive games and those are better.

09:49.680 --> 09:56.280
That's one argument that they're making and with the CMA in UK.

09:56.280 --> 09:59.960
That argument should be thrown out of court with with a copy of Forza Horizon, any of

09:59.960 --> 10:00.960
them on top.

10:00.960 --> 10:05.240
Well, then also they're saying, you know, Nintendo also has better quality exclusives

10:05.240 --> 10:07.560
as well that outsell their own first party games.

10:07.560 --> 10:12.040
And maybe, you know, maybe that is true to a certain extent.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.640
I don't know.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.720
And Sony, that's all opinions, Sony.

10:16.720 --> 10:22.200
You know, the argument is saying, well, hey, you're not like losing out on all of the first

10:22.200 --> 10:23.200
person shooter franchises.

10:23.200 --> 10:27.480
I mean, you have Battlefield, Battlefield is a great first person franchise.

10:27.480 --> 10:32.840
And so he's like, no, no, it's not.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.280
It is not as good as Call of Duty.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.640
And so that's kind of funny.

10:36.640 --> 10:39.980
They're saying, you know, Call of Duty is not replaceable.

10:39.980 --> 10:41.800
You could always bring back resistance.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.560
Sony, you feel that strongly about it.

10:43.560 --> 10:44.560
Why don't you bring back resistance?

10:44.560 --> 10:46.880
I would be for that for sure.

10:46.880 --> 10:47.880
I love resistance.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.520
That game was awesome.

10:50.520 --> 10:54.760
Really they should bring that back or even like Killzone would be fine.

10:54.760 --> 10:59.280
Bring that back to I mean, there's franchises that they have or I mean, gosh, they have

10:59.280 --> 11:00.760
a ton of franchises.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.180
There's mag that they stopped doing stuff with.

11:03.180 --> 11:04.180
So calm.

11:04.180 --> 11:10.760
I mean, so many franchises that could be a big like first person shooter, Call of Duty

11:10.760 --> 11:13.620
type game that they've just kind of dumped on.

11:13.620 --> 11:19.780
But they also that something somehow came out of this that Sony has confirmed that the

11:19.780 --> 11:29.040
release date of the PlayStation six is going to be somewhere around 2028, 2027.

11:29.040 --> 11:32.960
So so much for the days of when they were saying that the PlayStation three was a 10

11:32.960 --> 11:33.960
year life cycle.

11:33.960 --> 11:37.460
Well, I think they've just.

11:37.460 --> 11:38.460
They do this all the time.

11:38.460 --> 11:41.940
The 10 year life cycle doesn't mean that the next console can't come out and the life

11:41.940 --> 11:43.420
cycle, the old one continues.

11:43.420 --> 11:45.380
I think I think that's where they're going with it.

11:45.380 --> 11:49.660
I think a lot of I'm trying to remember when did the PlayStation three come out 2006.

11:49.660 --> 11:50.660
Right.

11:50.660 --> 11:52.060
And then when did the PlayStation four come out?

11:52.060 --> 11:53.700
Was it 2012 or 2013?

11:53.700 --> 11:56.820
Well, no, actually, I think the PlayStation.

11:56.820 --> 12:03.660
Yeah, it was 2006 and PlayStation four was.

12:03.660 --> 12:04.660
I think it was.

12:04.660 --> 12:05.660
Hmm.

12:05.660 --> 12:09.100
I'm going to have to fact check myself.

12:09.100 --> 12:10.100
It was 2013.

12:10.100 --> 12:11.100
13.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.100
Yeah.

12:12.100 --> 12:14.100
Because I remember I picked it up a year later.

12:14.100 --> 12:18.820
OK, so honestly, then that is so 2013.

12:18.820 --> 12:19.820
Here's the deal.

12:19.820 --> 12:21.220
So 2006 place.

12:21.220 --> 12:23.460
Actually, let's let's go all the way.

12:23.460 --> 12:24.460
Holy fuck.

12:24.460 --> 12:25.660
I believe the math works out.

12:25.660 --> 12:27.620
When did the original PlayStation come out?

12:27.620 --> 12:30.140
I think 97.

12:30.140 --> 12:33.580
No, I'm looking 94 in Japan.

12:33.580 --> 12:36.140
It was 95 here, but 94 in Japan.

12:36.140 --> 12:37.140
OK.

12:37.140 --> 12:38.140
Add seven.

12:38.140 --> 12:40.060
I didn't get until here we go.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.060
Sony.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.060
This news should not be news.

12:42.060 --> 12:43.060
Here's why.

12:43.060 --> 12:45.700
Sony PlayStation one out in Japan.

12:45.700 --> 12:47.420
December 1994.

12:47.420 --> 12:48.580
Add seven years.

12:48.580 --> 12:50.500
Now it's 2001.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.540
That's when the PlayStation two came out.

12:52.540 --> 12:53.540
Add seven years.

12:53.540 --> 12:57.700
OK, wait, I guess that one doesn't work because that's no way when did PlayStation two come

12:57.700 --> 12:58.700
out?

12:58.700 --> 13:00.820
It was 2000, 2000 or 2001.

13:00.820 --> 13:02.860
It was after 2000.

13:02.860 --> 13:04.420
I think it was in Japan early, though.

13:04.420 --> 13:05.420
It was.

13:05.420 --> 13:06.420
It was in Japan early.

13:06.420 --> 13:07.420
So it's 2000.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.420
So I take it back.

13:08.420 --> 13:09.420
Sorry.

13:09.420 --> 13:10.420
I need to get my year straight.

13:10.420 --> 13:11.420
OK, so six years.

13:11.420 --> 13:21.620
So 1994 to 2006 years, then 2000 to 2006, six years, then 2006 to 2013 when the PlayStation

13:21.620 --> 13:28.100
four came out, seven years, then 2013 to 2020, seven years.

13:28.100 --> 13:34.920
So Sony has literally always been on a six or seven year life cycle.

13:34.920 --> 13:40.100
So the news that the PlayStation six is coming in 2027 really shouldn't surprise you because

13:40.100 --> 13:42.980
the PlayStation five was out in 2020.

13:42.980 --> 13:44.820
However.

13:44.820 --> 13:47.820
I have seen where people are like, this feels like it's too soon.

13:47.820 --> 13:52.020
I can't even get my hands on a PlayStation five still, but about about and that's the

13:52.020 --> 13:58.820
thing that's different is that only the PlayStation five came out in a pandemic.

13:58.820 --> 14:03.580
And the PlayStation five had such these severe supply chain shortages that, you know, here

14:03.580 --> 14:05.500
we are in 2022.

14:05.500 --> 14:09.700
And only just now are these things kind of findable pretty easy.

14:09.700 --> 14:14.020
My understanding is if you sign up to get one on the PlayStation first hand store, whatever

14:14.020 --> 14:16.680
you're you're going to get one sooner rather than later.

14:16.680 --> 14:20.300
So these are not extraordinarily difficult to get anymore.

14:20.300 --> 14:26.580
But again, the whole can you just walk into Target and buy one sometimes depends on where

14:26.580 --> 14:27.980
you live.

14:27.980 --> 14:31.000
So that's that's where that's at.

14:31.000 --> 14:36.200
And I think that's why so so it doesn't feel like the PlayStation five launched in 2020.

14:36.200 --> 14:39.220
It feels like it's just now launching in 2022.

14:39.220 --> 14:43.100
So that's why it still feels kind of early, I think for the PlayStation six.

14:43.100 --> 14:48.140
But otherwise, the PS six being in 2027 is right on schedule.

14:48.140 --> 14:53.740
Yeah, I guess I'm not not too shocked.

14:53.740 --> 14:55.380
And all that stuff can change anyways.

14:55.380 --> 14:56.380
And who cares?

14:56.380 --> 15:00.740
Yeah, we always know that they're working on the next big console.

15:00.740 --> 15:09.180
Um, also, apparently, it Well, I don't know who's political is reporting that according

15:09.180 --> 15:14.020
to three people knowledge of the matter, that the FTC is likely to file an antitrust lawsuit

15:14.020 --> 15:18.880
against Microsoft to block the takeover of Activision.

15:18.880 --> 15:24.620
Of course, then Activision has come out and said, you know, that's just ridiculous.

15:24.620 --> 15:27.780
It's completely absurd.

15:27.780 --> 15:30.900
So I guess we'll see what happens.

15:30.900 --> 15:34.960
You know, predictions are all over the place.

15:34.960 --> 15:43.420
I mean, honestly, I'd be very surprised like if they do, like file an antitrust lawsuit

15:43.420 --> 15:47.260
against, you know, Microsoft, because I mean, they've let other mergers, especially in the

15:47.260 --> 15:52.260
entertainment space, go through that have been even more toxic than this up discovery.

15:52.260 --> 15:58.740
And, you know, um, so like, why this like, why Oh, but we're putting our foot down with

15:58.740 --> 16:00.060
these games.

16:00.060 --> 16:05.920
You know, I think some politicians want to want to put on their resume that they nailed

16:05.920 --> 16:07.900
Activision Blizzard.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.700
But like, yeah, but they can do that after the fall.

16:10.700 --> 16:14.780
And when in fact, as far as those issues are concerned, this merger is actually a good thing

16:14.780 --> 16:19.500
because there will be no place for Bobby Kotick in this future organization.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.880
And Phil Spencer is a more competent leader than anyone at the top of Activision.

16:22.880 --> 16:28.280
So like this in that department, it's you can tell the politicians don't follow the gaming

16:28.280 --> 16:29.360
industry.

16:29.360 --> 16:34.060
Because like this merger would actually be a good thing for all of those things.

16:34.060 --> 16:36.620
Some of them are super elderly.

16:36.620 --> 16:37.620
It's like ridiculous.

16:37.620 --> 16:39.180
Yeah, I don't know.

16:39.180 --> 16:40.180
I'm not surprised.

16:40.180 --> 16:41.180
I'm surprised.

16:41.180 --> 16:46.740
Yeah, we always used to get those like soundbites if they're like antiquated, like takes of

16:46.740 --> 16:51.200
stuff like, you know, well, I remember playing Pac Man and stuff like that.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.480
Now we're those people.

16:52.480 --> 16:55.420
So I don't know.

16:55.420 --> 17:00.740
Well, a very, very interesting thing is happening in Congress like just today.

17:00.740 --> 17:03.140
Because you know, Nancy Pelosi is retiring.

17:03.140 --> 17:07.780
And there's been a lot of talk about, you know, a new class kind of coming up to take

17:07.780 --> 17:08.780
her place.

17:08.780 --> 17:13.820
It was announced today that three younger when I say younger, I mean 30s 40s 50s politicians

17:13.820 --> 17:18.180
are going to be kind of coming up in the ranks behind them.

17:18.180 --> 17:20.780
Obviously though, the Democrats are not going to be in charge of the house next year, I'm

17:20.780 --> 17:23.260
not going to get into all those complex politics right now.

17:23.260 --> 17:29.220
But it's just one of those you do see that politicians are finally starting to hand the

17:29.220 --> 17:34.060
torch over to a newer generation that's probably going to be more in tune with some of this

17:34.060 --> 17:35.060
stuff.

17:35.060 --> 17:36.060
So that will be interesting.

17:36.060 --> 17:42.940
So, um, Bobby Blackwell says they did block a major book publisher deal random house when

17:42.940 --> 17:46.580
it emerged with Simon and Schuster and the feds block that I do remember when that was

17:46.580 --> 17:47.580
going on.

17:47.580 --> 17:49.860
They know what books are, um, sj 100.

17:49.860 --> 17:54.580
Matt does point out even if they block the merger, Microsoft can still do other things

17:54.580 --> 18:00.300
to make it not an antitrust issue like splitting off Xbox from Microsoft, or selling assets

18:00.300 --> 18:02.300
to make it not an antitrust issue.

18:02.300 --> 18:05.500
I don't see them splitting off Xbox, that would be wild.

18:05.500 --> 18:10.940
But I could see them cut off three, four, three, I could see them cutting king out of

18:10.940 --> 18:11.940
it.

18:11.940 --> 18:12.940
Actually, I don't know.

18:12.940 --> 18:14.120
I think that's the easy answer.

18:14.120 --> 18:19.420
But I actually am like Microsoft in the mobile game making space actually is probably more

18:19.420 --> 18:24.860
desirable than maybe even some of the components of Activision to be quite honest.

18:24.860 --> 18:30.940
So it'll it'll really come down to what are the parts of the merger that you know, the

18:30.940 --> 18:33.980
government really has a problem with and go from there.

18:33.980 --> 18:39.540
But I think that the answer to a lot of Sony's arguments is Nintendo.

18:39.540 --> 18:41.820
Like Nintendo is still a factor in the room.

18:41.820 --> 18:46.740
As far as we know, Nintendo and Microsoft do not have any publishing agreements together.

18:46.740 --> 18:51.800
And so Nintendo still continues to be the top selling console and have some of the top

18:51.800 --> 18:54.520
selling video games in the entire industry.

18:54.520 --> 18:58.820
So it's weird to me that this isn't Microsoft and Nintendo merging.

18:58.820 --> 19:00.940
It's Microsoft and Activision Blizzard merging.

19:00.940 --> 19:05.460
I just think it's real rich from Sony that like literally the tactics that they do now

19:05.460 --> 19:06.980
Microsoft is doing the same thing.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.360
They're like, Whoa, hold on.

19:08.360 --> 19:09.360
This is not okay.

19:09.360 --> 19:13.200
You're like, it's it's literally what you're doing.

19:13.200 --> 19:17.940
Like you do this stuff all the time with paid exclusives and, and like paid content for

19:17.940 --> 19:18.940
your service.

19:18.940 --> 19:20.580
Like, I'm sorry.

19:20.580 --> 19:25.900
This is exactly now you're now you're, you know, complaining because it's fair.

19:25.900 --> 19:26.900
Poor baby.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.260
Oh, no.

19:29.420 --> 19:33.180
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says they could sell Call of Duty to Tencent and that would fix

19:33.180 --> 19:37.220
it because really the issue is over Call of Duty so sell Call of Duty to Tencent and call

19:37.220 --> 19:38.220
it a day.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.020
God, I hope they don't sell it to Tencent.

19:40.020 --> 19:42.060
You want to talk about companies that are getting too big.

19:42.060 --> 19:44.460
Like that's that's a perfect example.

19:44.460 --> 19:46.700
I don't know who they'll I am.

19:46.700 --> 19:52.300
I would think you spin off that whole studio that makes Call of Duty into an independent

19:52.300 --> 19:55.500
studio and they they own the Call of Duty IP.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.500
And that's that.

19:56.500 --> 19:59.380
But then this then Sony comes in and buys them watch.

19:59.380 --> 20:05.740
Yeah, they would they would absolutely would that because they would and it would be all

20:05.740 --> 20:06.740
sudden fine.

20:06.740 --> 20:10.420
Because I you know, I'm sure they want to go sell it to Square Enix.

20:10.420 --> 20:14.140
Well, there is all these rumors about Sony wanting to get with Square Enix and why Square

20:14.140 --> 20:16.420
Enix just unloaded a bunch of their studios.

20:16.420 --> 20:23.340
Lutely no ethics in corporate, you know, procedure like they will just do whatever they want

20:23.340 --> 20:25.020
to stay on top.

20:25.020 --> 20:26.020
So like, yeah, absolutely.

20:26.020 --> 20:30.180
If they were to spin it off in their own independent company, they would absolutely move in and

20:30.180 --> 20:31.180
try to buy it.

20:31.180 --> 20:32.180
Yeah.

20:32.180 --> 20:37.780
I honestly and Bobby says every Activision studio makes a Call of Duty at Toys a Bob

20:37.780 --> 20:38.820
works on Call of Duty.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.980
They canceled a Skylanders game to work on Call of Duty.

20:40.980 --> 20:43.700
Yeah, no, that is that is true.

20:43.700 --> 20:48.620
I think I think I think the most fascinating part of the deal, if it went this way, would

20:48.620 --> 20:51.780
be what if they just spin off Activision and only by Blizzard King?

20:51.780 --> 20:58.540
I think I as a gamer, that's the part that would make me most happy, honestly, let Activision

20:58.540 --> 21:01.220
kind of do its own thing.

21:01.220 --> 21:05.040
And again, I don't want to see Bobby Cody in the industry, but I would love to see Blizzard

21:05.040 --> 21:08.860
and King just go under Microsoft and let Microsoft do what they're going to do with the Blizzard

21:08.860 --> 21:09.860
franchises.

21:09.860 --> 21:10.860
I think that would be a great thing.

21:10.860 --> 21:13.860
I think the gamers would stand to win a lot in that scenario.

21:13.860 --> 21:16.420
I mean, that's assuming Microsoft wants that.

21:16.420 --> 21:20.260
But you know, the point was brought up earlier, it really is about Call of Duty.

21:20.660 --> 21:24.180
World of Warcraft these days don't make the numbers that Call of Duty does.

21:24.180 --> 21:28.820
Overwatch, while it had a big launch, we still don't know about the sustainability of it.

21:28.820 --> 21:30.900
Diablo 4, too early to tell.

21:30.900 --> 21:33.080
So you know, we'll, we'll see.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.300
There's a lot more to come on that.

21:35.300 --> 21:39.460
So all right, let's move on.

21:39.460 --> 21:43.700
Before we get to our gaming weeks, I want to tell a little bit of a side story.

21:43.700 --> 21:47.600
So I was going to bring this up last week, but I kind of talked about last week on the

21:47.600 --> 21:48.600
show.

21:48.600 --> 21:52.480
I had a lot of feelings and I was not in a great mental place last week.

21:52.480 --> 21:54.280
I'm doing much better this week.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.280
Thank you.

21:55.280 --> 21:59.080
And yeah, thank you for letting me have my space on last week's show.

21:59.080 --> 22:02.680
But because I was in a weird headspace, I didn't want to talk about this trip yet that

22:02.680 --> 22:04.880
I had taken.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.980
But now that I'm doing much better tonight, not that everything has been magically fixed,

22:07.980 --> 22:10.160
I want to make sure that's very clear.

22:10.160 --> 22:14.320
Not that everything has been magically fixed, but I'm in a better headspace than I was last

22:14.320 --> 22:15.320
week.

22:15.320 --> 22:22.080
And that's what it's all about for being able to prepare certain segments and so forth.

22:22.080 --> 22:29.100
But two weeks ago, so we didn't have a show two weeks ago because I was out of town.

22:29.100 --> 22:34.080
I was up in Seattle and I didn't say this in advance because I didn't know if it would

22:34.080 --> 22:35.080
happen for sure.

22:35.080 --> 22:40.960
And I don't like to talk things up unless I know I'm there and everything happened.

22:40.960 --> 22:47.680
But I have a friend that I've known for a long time that actually a few months ago,

22:47.680 --> 22:52.400
maybe a year ago, the pandemic has completely warped my sense of time, so I apologize, but

22:52.400 --> 22:55.880
started working at the Pokemon Company International.

22:55.880 --> 22:59.440
And they are actually headquartered out in the Seattle area.

22:59.440 --> 23:01.720
So they're actually headquartered in Bellevue.

23:01.720 --> 23:06.680
And something really cool that I got to do a couple weeks ago was I actually got to take

23:06.680 --> 23:09.440
a little tour of the office.

23:09.440 --> 23:15.040
Now, before you all make up your own narratives about what went on here, because this actually

23:15.040 --> 23:18.880
would have been the week before Gen 9 came out.

23:18.880 --> 23:21.800
No, I did not get to see Gen 9 early.

23:21.800 --> 23:26.040
No, I did not see any work or any in progress things.

23:26.040 --> 23:30.240
No, I don't know any secrets or things like that.

23:30.240 --> 23:35.280
I got to tour an office building where people work and I didn't even get to see the cubes.

23:35.280 --> 23:41.760
Okay, I only got to see the common spaces that were available, but part of the reason

23:41.760 --> 23:46.640
why I share this with you all is that, especially for being a gamer, especially a gamer that

23:46.640 --> 23:51.080
really enjoys Pokemon, these were some really cool offices to be able to see.

23:51.080 --> 23:55.960
And this is also, it's not something that's open to the public.

23:55.960 --> 23:58.880
You can't just say, I want to go get a tour of the office.

23:58.880 --> 24:01.160
You can't exactly do that.

24:01.160 --> 24:06.000
I happen to know somebody that was able to make this happen.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.080
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, offices don't exist anymore anyway.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.240
We all work from home.

24:11.240 --> 24:15.200
You'll notice though, there's going to be some things here I'm going to show and I will

24:15.200 --> 24:16.600
talk through this on the podcast.

24:16.600 --> 24:17.600
I apologize.

24:17.600 --> 24:20.480
I don't have the videos on the podcast, but you can always check the archives over at

24:20.480 --> 24:26.200
twitch.tv slash a vog network where archives are accessible to subscribers over at twitch.tv

24:26.200 --> 24:27.880
slash vog network.

24:28.480 --> 24:31.640
Yeah, and Mike Deft also brings up a very good point.

24:31.640 --> 24:35.880
These offices don't handle development itself, marketing and stuff like that.

24:35.880 --> 24:40.880
While I am not privy to exactly what does and does not go on at this office, the sheer

24:40.880 --> 24:46.820
amount of conference rooms that I saw in this place tell me that there's a lot of meetings,

24:46.820 --> 24:52.600
be it clients, be it probably, you know, Japan, be it the fact that Nintendo is just located

24:52.600 --> 24:55.000
down the road in Redmond, and so on and so on.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.040
There's a lot of that stuff that goes on in these offices, absolutely.

24:59.040 --> 25:03.360
So anyway, so yeah, and many folks are noticing in the lobby where I took this picture because

25:03.360 --> 25:05.520
we had to get, you know, little special security stickers.

25:05.520 --> 25:09.440
We also went in there on a Saturday, which was nice because it was really, really like

25:09.440 --> 25:11.580
not bustling with people.

25:11.580 --> 25:13.400
And I didn't want to feel like I was getting in the way.

25:13.400 --> 25:16.280
I didn't want to have that imposter syndrome.

25:16.280 --> 25:19.880
So it was actually really awesome being there on a Saturday where very, very few people

25:19.880 --> 25:20.880
were there.

25:20.880 --> 25:22.800
But we still had to get badged and all that good stuff to get in and see the stuff.

25:22.800 --> 25:27.360
So yes, they have a little Detective Pikachu that sits in the front that is really cool.

25:27.360 --> 25:31.560
So moving on and showing you some of the other things that we got to see there.

25:31.560 --> 25:36.480
So this is also in the lobby where they actually have these really cool like vinyl figures,

25:36.480 --> 25:44.000
life size of Pikachu, Squirtle, Charmander, Bulbasaur, right, the Gen 1 collection.

25:44.000 --> 25:51.440
So yeah, DJ Rama S in chat says, friend of mine works for the Pokemon Company International.

25:51.440 --> 25:54.200
He flies all over the country to help a localization of the anime.

25:54.200 --> 25:57.760
Yeah, don't forget Pokemon is also much more than the games and you're going to see this

25:57.760 --> 25:58.760
in a minute.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.600
E3VL says, are they to scale?

26:00.600 --> 26:03.020
I feel like they're actually bigger than scale.

26:03.020 --> 26:05.800
But for the most part, yeah, I would say actually, yes, they are.

26:05.800 --> 26:08.640
They are to scale because they were very big.

26:08.640 --> 26:13.080
I'm not sure the picture that you see on stream really carries itself well, but these are

26:13.080 --> 26:16.600
very large vinyl figures, which obviously it was very photogenic.

26:16.600 --> 26:20.760
I also want to point out if you notice in the background of these photos, you can see

26:20.760 --> 26:24.240
that we're very high up in a building.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.540
Here's the interesting thing about where these offices are.

26:26.540 --> 26:29.720
The first three floors of this building in Bellevue are a mall.

26:29.720 --> 26:33.860
In fact, if you live in the Seattle area, you've probably been to this mall and didn't

26:33.860 --> 26:38.040
even frickin realize that the Pokemon Company was in this building because I had been to

26:38.040 --> 26:40.200
this mall in Bellevue.

26:40.200 --> 26:43.720
There's a legendary dumpling place in this mall and I'm telling you, if you're in the

26:43.720 --> 26:46.260
Seattle area, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

26:46.260 --> 26:50.260
There's a legendary dumpling place in this mall that I went to with friends like six

26:50.260 --> 26:53.420
years ago.

26:53.420 --> 26:56.380
Going back on this trip gave me the weirdest deja vu.

26:56.380 --> 26:59.780
So yeah, we're way up on the 25th, 26th, sorry.

26:59.780 --> 27:02.340
I don't remember exactly what floor it's on.

27:02.340 --> 27:06.020
I'm sure the back of video game manuals would tell you what floor it's on.

27:06.020 --> 27:10.100
It's not like it's a super secret, but it's probably not something I should be sitting

27:10.100 --> 27:14.220
here yapping about on air anyway.

27:14.220 --> 27:15.220
Moving on.

27:15.220 --> 27:16.220
Let's see.

27:16.220 --> 27:17.220
Okay, I got to actually click to the next slide.

27:17.220 --> 27:18.220
Fine.

27:18.220 --> 27:19.260
Okay, I like this.

27:19.260 --> 27:22.580
It's maybe a little hard to see on stream, but what I want to point out, I saw this is

27:22.580 --> 27:23.580
cool.

27:23.580 --> 27:26.860
This is like a common space where people can work and you get a really good sense of the

27:26.860 --> 27:30.620
view in the back and you can actually see like downtown Seattle back there.

27:30.620 --> 27:35.860
But they actually have this clear wall and on this clear wall, they have vinyl stickers

27:35.860 --> 27:39.860
of the original sprites for all 151 original Pokemon.

27:39.860 --> 27:42.260
And so that's what you actually see on the wall and it's in Pokedex order.

27:42.260 --> 27:47.260
So you look at the upper left, you see Bulbasaur, Venusaur, so on and so on, or excuse me, Bulbasaur,

27:47.260 --> 27:52.020
Ivysaur, Venusaur, sorry, Pokemon fans, and moving on through and all that good stuff.

27:52.020 --> 27:56.940
So I thought this was a really cool little collection of little like vinyl sticker things

27:56.940 --> 27:58.860
that were on this.

27:58.860 --> 28:01.980
This I thought was one of the coolest rooms in the whole place.

28:01.980 --> 28:04.260
And what we're looking at here, this is actually like a break room, right?

28:04.260 --> 28:07.780
You can probably tell like, oh, it's like a, you know, they can see a little coffee

28:07.780 --> 28:11.820
machine in there and stuff and counters and all that stuff.

28:11.820 --> 28:16.420
The really cool thing about this is in the back where these diner style booths are that

28:16.420 --> 28:19.300
you can sit and chat and have lunch together and so forth.

28:19.300 --> 28:26.420
They actually have artwork of the Pokemon centers, but they're made in those tiles that

28:26.420 --> 28:30.460
you see like in kitchens and diners, those little square tiles.

28:30.460 --> 28:32.220
It makes up the pixel art.

28:32.220 --> 28:38.820
And so it's actually pixel art of the Pokemon centers from every generation of Pokemon that

28:38.820 --> 28:44.780
was pixelized that you can see the hall keeps going where my picture taking didn't go, but

28:44.780 --> 28:46.380
they're all there in the area.

28:46.380 --> 28:50.260
So, but I just thought this was a really cool little room and I was like, I want to take

28:50.260 --> 28:51.260
my lunches here.

28:51.260 --> 28:52.580
This is really cool.

28:52.580 --> 28:59.260
So yeah, and bonds 006 says this looks like a few corporate or company office space I've

28:59.260 --> 29:00.260
worked or been in.

29:00.260 --> 29:01.260
Yeah.

29:01.260 --> 29:03.500
At the end of the day, y'all it's an office space.

29:03.500 --> 29:06.940
This was not, you know, like a play a demo space again.

29:06.940 --> 29:08.840
That's not what I was there to do.

29:08.840 --> 29:12.940
But it's a really like when I saw this, I was like, I want to work in this office space.

29:12.940 --> 29:15.700
I'd go into the office more often if my office looked like this.

29:15.700 --> 29:16.700
That's for sure.

29:16.700 --> 29:17.700
All right.

29:17.700 --> 29:20.760
This is one of the meeting rooms featuring one of my favorite Pokemon.

29:20.760 --> 29:26.740
So this is actually is like a Pokemon that is, you'll notice the way it's kind of done

29:26.740 --> 29:31.660
is that when the doors are closed, you actually can't really see into the meeting room.

29:31.660 --> 29:34.340
And I'm sure there's a very good intent behind that.

29:34.340 --> 29:37.880
And all of the meeting rooms, they're actually named after Pokemon.

29:37.880 --> 29:40.580
So this one was the Lucario meeting room was one of my favorites.

29:40.580 --> 29:44.780
You can actually see they actually have the artwork on the little reservation room and

29:44.780 --> 29:49.060
you can actually see like, oh, yeah, this one, I believe on the other.

29:49.060 --> 29:51.220
So Bobby Black Wolf notes that there's a rope.

29:51.220 --> 29:52.820
The rope wasn't for the conference room.

29:52.820 --> 29:56.260
I believe there was some type of large figurine there.

29:56.260 --> 29:57.260
You can see it.

29:57.260 --> 30:01.620
Look in the reflection of the office, and I'm not sure how it's coming over over stream.

30:01.620 --> 30:06.780
But if you actually notice there in the reflection, you can see there are some large vinyl figures

30:06.780 --> 30:08.460
that are on the other side of those ropes.

30:08.460 --> 30:10.520
And that's what's actually roped off.

30:10.520 --> 30:13.020
They probably just don't want people reaching over and touching them and getting their germs

30:13.020 --> 30:16.840
on them, which is weird because this isn't exactly a public space.

30:16.840 --> 30:20.800
The other thing again, you have to look really, really carefully in the reflection, you probably

30:20.800 --> 30:23.740
notice a grid of things behind the Lucario.

30:23.740 --> 30:27.520
It's because and you'll notice my reflection, they're taking the picture, which I didn't

30:27.520 --> 30:28.900
realize, but that's right.

30:28.900 --> 30:32.320
They actually have a trading card collection in the back there.

30:32.320 --> 30:38.000
They have framed trading cards of I believe it is again, the pokey decks, but this time

30:38.000 --> 30:39.920
it goes all the way through.

30:39.920 --> 30:46.680
It's like eight or nine of these things hung up with a Pokemon trading card game card for

30:46.680 --> 30:50.400
every one of the Pokemon in the deck starting from one.

30:50.400 --> 30:51.400
So that yeah.

30:51.400 --> 30:53.560
And Bobby says that's the national decks pretty much.

30:53.560 --> 30:54.560
Yeah.

30:54.560 --> 31:00.640
But again, nothing Gen 9 was in there as it because we were in that awkward phase where

31:00.640 --> 31:05.600
I was like, we all know the Gen 9 Pokemon because those leaks started.

31:05.600 --> 31:10.120
But it's like, but officially we can't talk about that yet because the game hasn't launched.

31:10.120 --> 31:16.360
So there's no Gen 9 stuff in the space, but I think it might be the next picture actually.

31:16.360 --> 31:17.360
Yes.

31:17.360 --> 31:21.560
The wall of plushies that actually shows, I don't know if this is like every plushie

31:21.560 --> 31:25.240
that's been released, but I'll be darned if it doesn't feel like every plushie that's

31:25.240 --> 31:27.120
been released that was in this wall.

31:27.120 --> 31:34.160
There are no Gen 9, but my understanding was those were incoming pretty soon.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.400
So when Gen 9 officially launched.

31:36.400 --> 31:39.140
So yeah, but this was pretty cool.

31:39.140 --> 31:44.800
This plushie wall, it had, I noticed the ditto versions of plushies.

31:44.800 --> 31:48.320
There's a whole section of those and yeah, plushie, plushie heaven.

31:48.320 --> 31:52.880
Honestly, it just looks like Shane's bedroom to be honest, except with not enough oshawots,

31:52.880 --> 31:55.200
but otherwise there were lots of cool little plushies.

31:55.200 --> 32:00.160
And yeah, they did have Pokemon Legends Arceus themed stuff in there, which was pretty cool.

32:00.160 --> 32:02.200
So I liked the plushie wall.

32:02.200 --> 32:04.080
It's hard to not like the plushie wall.

32:04.720 --> 32:09.120
This room is another kind of break area and I thought this was really cool.

32:09.120 --> 32:13.840
And it also shows that again, the Pokemon Company is about much more than just games

32:13.840 --> 32:20.000
because they actually had a whole reading library, which features, as I understand it,

32:20.000 --> 32:24.080
every Pokemon related book that's ever come out was in this room.

32:25.280 --> 32:29.360
Even foreign language ones were in the back because I was looking at some that were in

32:29.360 --> 32:30.560
French and so forth.

32:30.560 --> 32:34.960
And I did look for the book, Come Out Squirtle, and it was there.

32:34.960 --> 32:40.720
In fact, there was a whole series in that, which was pretty cool.

32:40.720 --> 32:44.560
So yeah, I thought the reading library was really cool.

32:44.560 --> 32:45.760
Obviously, they have rules posted.

32:45.760 --> 32:47.120
Don't take books out of the room.

32:47.120 --> 32:53.680
But I'm thinking, hey, as Rama said earlier, Rama has a friend that works with localization

32:53.680 --> 32:54.160
and stuff.

32:54.160 --> 32:59.040
And if I'm somebody that needs to be an expert on Pokemon lore because I'm working with topics

32:59.040 --> 33:04.480
like that, it's awfully convenient to have this kind of library right where you're at.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.240
So I thought this was very neat.

33:06.240 --> 33:10.000
And one other thing that they had, you have to look really carefully at the top shelf

33:10.560 --> 33:15.120
that you can see in this picture or just look at this next slide I have that actually has

33:15.120 --> 33:18.160
some of the movie props from Detective Pikachu.

33:18.160 --> 33:23.280
So I had to stand on my tiptoes to get this picture, but it actually has a little ticket

33:23.280 --> 33:26.400
that they had with Rhyme City and a little map.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.640
And they had one of the coffees from Hi Hat Cafe.

33:29.440 --> 33:33.840
And I believe the Detective Pikachu that you saw in the front was also a Detective

33:33.840 --> 33:38.000
Pikachu that was from the movie, although I think it was animated.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.760
So maybe it was like a placeholder or something.

33:39.760 --> 33:40.320
I don't know.

33:40.320 --> 33:43.680
But I thought it was neat to see some of the movie props were there as well.

33:43.680 --> 33:44.960
So that was a lot of fun.

33:45.520 --> 33:47.760
So just a couple more.

33:48.480 --> 33:49.680
This was Alan and I.

33:49.680 --> 33:53.280
We were just, again, the view is beautiful.

33:53.280 --> 33:56.880
And you can actually see in this particular picture, not only do you see the bay there

33:56.880 --> 34:02.800
in Seattle, but you actually see there's this really circular park that's down below.

34:02.800 --> 34:07.760
This is where we, after we were done with our tour, we actually went down to this park

34:07.760 --> 34:12.960
to actually go play Pokemon Community Day, which was a lot of fun.

34:12.960 --> 34:14.640
It was the Teddiursa day was that day.

34:14.640 --> 34:17.040
And I caught a four star Pokemon at that park.

34:17.040 --> 34:19.440
And it's loaded with Poke stops.

34:19.440 --> 34:22.960
Like every memorial bench in that place was some type of Poke stop.

34:22.960 --> 34:28.000
So yeah, that was my little tour of the building.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.520
I had a lot of fun.

34:29.520 --> 34:34.080
And I'm really, really thankful for the opportunity to kind of get to peek behind the curtain

34:34.080 --> 34:34.800
a little bit.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.280
At the end of the day, yes, it's an office building.

34:37.280 --> 34:42.960
But it's, again, if I got to work in an office like that, I'd go in all the time.

34:42.960 --> 34:44.320
That was a lot of fun.

34:44.320 --> 34:47.200
So Zen Monkey says you guys look like Pokemon trainers.

34:47.200 --> 34:50.320
Yeah, we were that day because we got to...

34:50.320 --> 34:54.240
And actually, I think I had my Pogo Plus on me and I was catching stuff as we were walking

34:54.240 --> 34:54.560
around.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.320
So that was pretty cool.

34:56.320 --> 34:56.960
So let's see.

34:56.960 --> 35:01.600
Bond 006 says Sony Wonder Lab in New York City here would have past products detailing

35:01.600 --> 35:02.880
the history of the company.

35:02.880 --> 35:06.800
As you traverse the building, you would encounter a lot of sites that either locked to specific

35:06.800 --> 35:09.360
regions and or from other markets.

35:09.360 --> 35:11.600
Products not really stateside or from other countries.

35:11.600 --> 35:17.280
Yeah, a little like that library I had mentioned had some of the books from other countries,

35:17.280 --> 35:18.240
which I thought was really cool.

35:18.880 --> 35:21.920
And Bobby Blackwell says that's why they make cool office spaces.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.360
It's a selling point for recruitment.

35:23.360 --> 35:24.000
Absolutely.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.160
I didn't even get enough pictures of the whole because there were actually two floors we

35:28.160 --> 35:28.800
got to see.

35:28.800 --> 35:32.320
Alan got more pictures than I did, admittedly, because I'm one of those more like I want

35:32.320 --> 35:33.120
to be in the moment.

35:33.120 --> 35:35.280
But then I was like, I should probably take some pictures for OLR.

35:36.240 --> 35:41.600
So that whole little space where that last photo was is actually like all like jungle

35:41.600 --> 35:42.080
themed.

35:42.080 --> 35:45.120
And it's supposed to be themed after like a Pokemon type of area.

35:45.120 --> 35:46.240
And it did look really cool.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.720
So it was pretty neat.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.640
Mike Def says, I wonder if they have Pokemon fusion manga in there.

35:52.640 --> 35:53.680
It never made it overseas.

35:53.680 --> 35:55.120
Honestly, probably.

35:55.120 --> 35:59.120
So I didn't look those like I can't 100% confirm or deny.

35:59.120 --> 36:02.240
So She Hulk says, did you pick up a job application?

36:04.240 --> 36:05.840
I can't relocate at this point.

36:05.840 --> 36:10.640
We own a home here in Sacramento now, and that's it.

36:10.640 --> 36:12.960
I enjoy my day job a lot.

36:12.960 --> 36:15.040
I know I don't talk about it here on the program.

36:15.680 --> 36:19.200
I do not work in the game industry, and I am okay with that.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.600
My day job is a very boring.

36:21.600 --> 36:23.280
And I say that in the best possible way.

36:23.280 --> 36:26.480
Corporate job with a very boring corporate office.

36:26.480 --> 36:30.160
I again say that the nicest possible way that doesn't look anything like what we just saw.

36:30.160 --> 36:32.240
And I'm perfectly happy with where I'm at.

36:32.240 --> 36:39.120
So no, I did not get a job application, but I'm thrilled for my friend who does work there

36:39.120 --> 36:43.520
and obviously raves about it and was able to give us that opportunity and so forth.

36:43.520 --> 36:46.560
And it was just a cool little extra little perk for our trip.

36:46.560 --> 36:48.560
So awesome.

36:48.560 --> 36:50.720
Bobby Lockwell says, do they need a corporate trainer?

36:53.040 --> 36:54.880
Keep in mind, I don't do the training anymore.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.800
I manage that.

36:56.800 --> 36:59.520
So anyway, but not to get too into that.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.280
So let's see.

37:02.480 --> 37:03.280
Yeah, so thank you.

37:03.280 --> 37:05.440
Thank you for the comments in our chat room there.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.840
And yeah, thanks again for the tour.

37:07.840 --> 37:12.720
And yeah, maybe next time I'm there, maybe they'll update some things and we'll get a

37:12.720 --> 37:14.720
2.0 look at things.

37:14.720 --> 37:15.760
So, all right.

37:15.760 --> 37:16.880
In the meantime, let's move on.

37:16.880 --> 37:20.480
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing

37:20.480 --> 37:22.480
this week, whether it was Pokemon or something else.

37:22.480 --> 37:23.760
Let's go to Loki.

37:23.760 --> 37:24.640
How was your gaming week?

37:25.200 --> 37:27.040
It was Minecraft.

37:29.120 --> 37:34.320
I haven't gone back to play more of the Go Simulator 3 stuff.

37:34.320 --> 37:37.840
My kid's been bugging me to do it though, because he's like 100% in the thing now.

37:38.640 --> 37:39.140
Wow.

37:39.760 --> 37:42.320
But yeah, I've been playing a lot of Minecraft.

37:42.320 --> 37:45.040
I started obviously the modded series last week.

37:45.040 --> 37:50.080
So did that and that's been fun.

37:50.080 --> 37:50.960
Messed around with that.

37:50.960 --> 37:53.520
And then I'm still working on stuff for Channel 64 as well.

37:53.520 --> 37:55.920
I've been doing that like last few days.

37:56.480 --> 37:58.080
So it's slow going.

37:58.080 --> 38:00.720
I'm coming up on four weeks since I put out an actual video.

38:01.600 --> 38:07.040
I mean, I did live stream in the middle there, but it's, you know, I'm cognizant of the time.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.160
It keeps getting more complicated, the builds that I'm doing.

38:12.160 --> 38:14.000
So it takes time.

38:14.000 --> 38:14.800
But yeah.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.840
And then, you know, more characters being designed.

38:17.840 --> 38:20.640
I almost have all eight of my robot masters designed now.

38:20.640 --> 38:24.800
So it's just, I think we're one left.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.880
I think it'd be pretty cool.

38:26.880 --> 38:29.360
So those have been being posted on Twitter and stuff.

38:30.400 --> 38:31.680
But yeah, that's pretty much it.

38:31.680 --> 38:32.480
It's been Minecraft.

38:33.280 --> 38:33.780
All right.

38:34.400 --> 38:35.040
My gaming week.

38:35.040 --> 38:38.480
Again, I was out of town for a few days, as I'm sure a lot of people were off celebrating

38:38.480 --> 38:39.520
the holidays in the States.

38:40.240 --> 38:43.200
So I didn't play a lot of new stuff, but I continued on with some of the stuff I've been

38:43.200 --> 38:43.760
playing.

38:43.760 --> 38:47.600
So ironically, with Pokemon, I'm still been playing Pokemon Scarlet.

38:47.600 --> 38:51.040
I keep on saying Scarlet and Violet, but technically I'm playing Pokemon Scarlet.

38:51.840 --> 38:53.280
And I've been continuing on with that.

38:53.280 --> 38:58.640
I am at two, two and two, which if you know the basics of the game, it isn't just gyms

38:58.640 --> 38:59.280
now anymore.

38:59.280 --> 38:59.920
That's one part.

38:59.920 --> 39:03.520
That's so I've beaten two gyms, but now there are star bases.

39:03.520 --> 39:05.200
You can think Team Rocket.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.720
You know, there's a new version of that.

39:06.720 --> 39:07.920
The antagonist in every game.

39:07.920 --> 39:08.880
This one's Team Star.

39:09.680 --> 39:14.160
And I love some of the little sayings they have, like Hasta la vie star and the little

39:14.160 --> 39:16.880
little gang sign they do as a little star.

39:16.880 --> 39:17.600
It's super cute.

39:18.560 --> 39:25.200
So I'm at two star bases and two Titan Pokemon, which is kind of a new thing where it's like,

39:26.320 --> 39:31.680
it reminds me a little bit of there's a mechanic in another game like this, but it just basically

39:31.680 --> 39:34.240
larger basically raid Pokemon that are out in the wild.

39:34.240 --> 39:37.520
I don't know how else to describe it, but I've done two of those as well.

39:38.480 --> 39:44.080
I have been keeping my playthrough to only on stream as well, which is part of the reason

39:44.080 --> 39:45.840
why I'm a little slower going than some.

39:46.560 --> 39:51.040
But I've been really enjoying playing on stream on stream this week.

39:52.320 --> 39:55.840
The folks actually watched me run right by a shiny.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.280
That's right.

39:57.280 --> 39:58.080
I passed up.

39:58.080 --> 40:01.680
I missed a fucking shiny until it was too late.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.040
That that hurt, to be honest.

40:05.600 --> 40:06.320
What can I say?

40:06.320 --> 40:10.400
Actually, I want to see if I can actually get that clip as much as it pains me to play

40:10.400 --> 40:10.900
this.

40:11.680 --> 40:18.800
It was pretty interesting because I want to show you like just how easy this is to miss.

40:18.800 --> 40:19.600
So how do I do this?

40:19.600 --> 40:21.200
I'm going to go over to this monitor.

40:21.200 --> 40:22.320
I'm going to make this large.

40:22.320 --> 40:25.920
Okay, sorry, I'm doing some I'm doing some producing live on the fly here.

40:25.920 --> 40:29.600
So and I'll describe this again for those in chat.

40:29.600 --> 40:31.200
I'll just on the feed.

40:31.200 --> 40:33.600
I'll just I'll describe what's happening.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.200
Some of this audio is going to come through.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.920
So let me I'm going to play the clip respond over there.

40:41.760 --> 40:43.520
I'm fitting it for people.

40:43.520 --> 40:44.020
Shut up.

40:44.880 --> 40:45.840
Or you're next.

40:45.840 --> 40:46.880
Give me your lunch money.

40:48.640 --> 40:50.480
And that's where Shane says there was a shiny.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.000
Did you see it?

40:52.720 --> 40:54.480
Those of you watching on Twitch on this Sunday night.

40:54.480 --> 40:55.440
Did you see the shiny?

40:56.560 --> 40:58.480
Let me point out where the shiny was.

40:58.480 --> 41:01.440
So the problem was me replay.

41:02.160 --> 41:07.200
My eyes were here because I'm fixated on Oh, I'm sorry, you can't see me.

41:07.200 --> 41:09.360
Okay, my eyes were in the center of the screen.

41:09.360 --> 41:13.840
And I was fixated on the road ahead because I'm riding my little legendary Pokemon trying

41:13.840 --> 41:16.560
to get back up the trail because I had fallen down or something.

41:16.560 --> 41:19.120
It's something I didn't intend to do happened.

41:19.120 --> 41:24.160
So as my eyes are over on this side of the screen, what happens is I'm running by.

41:24.720 --> 41:26.560
It's really blink and you miss it.

41:27.280 --> 41:31.200
Look, a pack of drift flumes comes up on the left.

41:31.200 --> 41:34.320
And sure enough, one of them is a yellow shiny.

41:34.320 --> 41:38.640
But because my eyes were over on the right side and not way on the left for that shiny

41:38.640 --> 41:40.960
was I ended up running right by it.

41:40.960 --> 41:44.480
And that that was that was how literally one second.

41:44.480 --> 41:44.980
Shut up.

41:45.920 --> 41:46.480
Or you're next.

41:46.480 --> 41:46.960
And I missed it.

41:46.960 --> 41:47.760
Give me your lunch money.

41:51.200 --> 41:53.440
Y'all want to hear a sad story for the holidays, right?

41:53.760 --> 41:57.040
Oh, well, it's just a shiny shiny Pokemon are stupid.

41:57.040 --> 41:57.920
Anyway, that's Shane's thing.

41:57.920 --> 41:58.640
That's not my thing.

42:02.640 --> 42:03.680
That's a flower.

42:03.680 --> 42:05.280
I know I know.

42:05.280 --> 42:06.080
All right.

42:06.080 --> 42:09.520
Anyway, so I was playing Pokemon and yeah, thank you.

42:09.520 --> 42:10.400
F's in the chat.

42:10.400 --> 42:13.360
I love F F as an unknown in the chat for Rob.

42:13.360 --> 42:14.080
Thanks, Steph.

42:14.080 --> 42:14.560
Appreciate it.

42:15.760 --> 42:18.720
So yeah, I've been playing Scarlet and Violet and I've still been playing Dead by Daylight

42:18.720 --> 42:19.280
a little bit.

42:19.280 --> 42:21.920
It's the reason why that game still appears.

42:21.920 --> 42:25.920
The reason why that game still appeals to me, even though, well, they did release new

42:25.920 --> 42:27.120
content this last week.

42:27.120 --> 42:29.280
They have a new killer, the Knight.

42:29.280 --> 42:32.160
So the Knight's mechanic is that he can summon his friends.

42:32.160 --> 42:36.400
He has the brotherhood and you actually trace these little routes and then your friends

42:36.400 --> 42:38.080
patrol the routes.

42:38.080 --> 42:41.920
And then if a survivor walks through him, the friend can actually damage him.

42:41.920 --> 42:43.440
So it's kind of an interesting little twist.

42:44.320 --> 42:47.200
So the Knight and then there's a new survivor as well, Vittorio.

42:48.080 --> 42:51.200
And so, yeah, I've just been leveling up the new survivor in that game because I want to

42:51.200 --> 42:54.320
get his perks because he has some really good perks that I want to get.

42:55.760 --> 42:57.280
But yes, that's what's really it.

42:57.280 --> 42:58.480
Pokemon Dead by Daylight.

42:58.480 --> 42:58.960
That's it.

42:58.960 --> 43:01.120
I haven't been playing a lot else this week because the holiday.

43:01.120 --> 43:04.160
So all right, we'll get some more games next week for sure.

43:04.160 --> 43:06.880
And I'll still be playing Pokemon on stream.

43:07.680 --> 43:09.680
I did play a little vampire survivors.

43:09.680 --> 43:11.120
Actually, I talked about that last week.

43:11.120 --> 43:12.160
How I got back into that recently.

43:12.160 --> 43:14.560
I think I did fire that up on like Monday or Tuesday night.

43:14.560 --> 43:16.880
I did another run through on that game.

43:16.880 --> 43:23.520
So that's the genre I'm feeling right now is those survivor games of which if you think

43:23.520 --> 43:25.760
we haven't seen plenty yet, just wait.

43:25.760 --> 43:26.880
Just wait next year.

43:26.880 --> 43:28.320
It's going to be going to be the new thing.

43:28.320 --> 43:29.600
It's not roguelikes.

43:29.600 --> 43:34.960
It's which ironically, these survivor games are a derivative of roguelikes.

43:34.960 --> 43:38.800
But that's that's going to be the big thing in the coming months for sure.

43:38.800 --> 43:44.320
So all right, let's move on and get into some gaming news this week of which admittedly

43:44.320 --> 43:45.840
there's not as much.

43:45.840 --> 43:50.640
So we may not be here as long tonight, but we're going to get through what there there

43:50.640 --> 43:57.040
is come out and a big one to start us off about a big game that came out a week ago

43:57.040 --> 43:58.640
that everybody is still talking about.

43:59.520 --> 44:09.440
And this is why the Pokemon company and Game Freak will never worry about quality in their

44:09.440 --> 44:13.280
games because you folks will just buy them regardless.

44:13.280 --> 44:19.120
Pokemon, Scarlet and Violet have sold over 10 million copies in the first weekend.

44:20.080 --> 44:21.120
Congratulations.

44:21.120 --> 44:22.720
You guys are part of the problem now.

44:22.720 --> 44:25.600
And how about a 9.5 million of those are preorders?

44:25.600 --> 44:27.200
Easy, easy.

44:27.200 --> 44:28.640
I'm sure that they are.

44:28.640 --> 44:31.120
But you know, it is what it is.

44:31.120 --> 44:36.960
And that that's no one can complain about quality in those games now because you've

44:36.960 --> 44:37.920
voted with your wallet.

44:37.920 --> 44:39.440
So that's what you're going to get.

44:39.440 --> 44:45.920
I I mean, yes, the game is buggy, but it like for me, it honestly doesn't ruin it.

44:45.920 --> 44:49.280
I and I don't know if I'm at the point where I would say the bugs are charming.

44:50.400 --> 44:54.640
Like I know you enjoy like driver just because it's one of those so bad buggy.

44:54.640 --> 44:56.080
It's good type of games.

44:56.080 --> 45:01.280
I'm not sure I would put Pokemon firmly in that camp, but the bugs are just like laughably

45:01.280 --> 45:02.240
bad when they happen.

45:02.240 --> 45:03.040
And then that's all it is.

45:03.040 --> 45:05.040
I laugh it off because it doesn't break my game.

45:05.040 --> 45:07.200
I have heard there are game breaking bugs.

45:07.200 --> 45:13.520
It hasn't happened to me and I auto save enough where I feel like I don't even if a breaking

45:13.520 --> 45:16.560
bug happened to me, I don't think it would really shut me down.

45:17.440 --> 45:18.000
But I don't know.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.800
Like I I don't want to say I'm totally reminded of the Mass Effect Andromeda issues because

45:23.360 --> 45:25.360
here here's also a great example.

45:26.480 --> 45:29.680
Mass Effect Andromeda released three days early to a certain audience.

45:29.680 --> 45:33.200
So all of this hit the Internet so everybody could say stop and wait.

45:33.200 --> 45:38.400
Nintendo, on the other hand, keeps this shit under iron lock and fucking key until this

45:38.400 --> 45:39.280
game comes out.

45:39.280 --> 45:41.440
Now, they didn't stop leaks from happening.

45:41.440 --> 45:45.040
So there were news out there about the games being a little bit buggy.

45:45.600 --> 45:50.000
But I don't think I don't even think the leakers knew the full extent of like all the crazy

45:50.000 --> 45:52.800
things you could do in the game until the games were out.

45:52.800 --> 45:58.080
But it you know, and I said this back then with Mass Effect Andromeda, EA's huge mistake

45:58.080 --> 46:02.320
was being greedy with that online program and letting people play that game three days

46:02.320 --> 46:02.640
early.

46:02.720 --> 46:05.840
That is that is one of the biggest mistakes EA has ever made.

46:07.040 --> 46:10.400
Quite honestly, because I mean, once they release the game, especially a month after

46:10.400 --> 46:12.480
when they fix the bugs, the game is fine.

46:13.600 --> 46:21.040
But it's Yeah, well, it's it's it's perpetuating the problem, though, that we have where it's

46:21.040 --> 46:25.200
okay now for these companies to release games that are clearly not ready for launch.

46:25.840 --> 46:32.080
And that's the problem is, is whether it's motivation by we just got to get it out before

46:32.080 --> 46:38.400
holiday sales happen, or we're, you know, incentivized, which isn't good enough, or

46:38.400 --> 46:42.720
the switch isn't good enough, you know, it could be some of that, that I would still

46:42.720 --> 46:47.760
argue, though, that other games have run more smoothly, it's I think it's less that it's

46:47.760 --> 46:55.840
more or less optimized game is more impacted by the switches, not cutting edge performance

46:55.840 --> 46:56.480
anymore.

46:56.560 --> 47:02.160
And so whereas some games, you know, on other causes could get by with not being optimized

47:02.160 --> 47:02.880
as much.

47:03.520 --> 47:08.800
It does affect it when you're having to really squeeze every ounce of power and performance

47:08.800 --> 47:09.840
out of this console.

47:09.840 --> 47:13.600
Yeah, it's not, you know, it's, it's unfortunate.

47:13.600 --> 47:17.840
Like, there's a lot of games where I would have given it a pass, you know, if it's like

47:17.840 --> 47:24.560
extremely buggy and stuff, but it's, it's becoming a point now where we I don't think

47:24.560 --> 47:25.760
we can do that anymore.

47:25.760 --> 47:30.720
Because there's just so many games that we hear about coming out being broken and buggy.

47:30.720 --> 47:35.120
And it's because we're sending the message just pre ordering and buying these games,

47:35.120 --> 47:40.160
you know, without knowing what we're getting into the where they're just like, how many

47:40.160 --> 47:43.840
stories have we heard about different companies putting out roadmaps about how they're going

47:43.840 --> 47:44.560
to fix their game?

47:45.680 --> 47:46.400
It's ridiculous.

47:46.400 --> 47:51.520
I get I get messages on Facebook all the time I see because I follow Saints Row on there

47:51.520 --> 47:56.880
about how they're all over or we're working on our performance something something like

47:56.880 --> 47:58.160
I don't even care anymore.

47:58.160 --> 48:04.640
Like I just don't because it's like so far out past launch and you're still fixing the

48:04.640 --> 48:09.200
game that was released in the state like I don't know.

48:09.200 --> 48:13.600
All right, and this it looks bad for Nintendo, I think, but I think it looks bad for the

48:13.600 --> 48:14.160
switch.

48:14.160 --> 48:19.040
I you know, I put a lot of the blame on the switch being antiquated hardware is the Nintendo

48:19.040 --> 48:24.160
probably has to I would say that they can't take the stance of like, well, we're just

48:24.160 --> 48:27.200
going to be a new couple generations behind performance.

48:28.080 --> 48:29.840
I don't think you should be doing that anymore.

48:29.840 --> 48:31.040
There's effects.

48:31.040 --> 48:33.200
Well, I was just say there's some important comments in chat I want to read.

48:34.080 --> 48:38.480
First off quest Buster who brings up I think another one of those franchises that gets

48:38.480 --> 48:40.880
away with his bugs and it's because they're adorable.

48:41.520 --> 48:47.680
Quest Buster says for me Bethesda's Elder Scrolls RPGs like Skyrim are notoriously buggy,

48:47.680 --> 48:51.440
but I slog through those because I was still able to enjoy them quite a bit.

48:51.440 --> 48:55.360
Still would love to see them improve their bug squashing though, hopefully with Starfield.

48:55.360 --> 49:00.800
I think that is a great analogy because a lot of people will defend Skyrim and those

49:00.800 --> 49:05.680
games release in really sad buggy states, but you kind of let it slide because it's

49:05.680 --> 49:07.120
a great story and a great game.

49:07.840 --> 49:10.160
Well, but in that is almost the same.

49:10.160 --> 49:16.480
It's it's a similar situation too, because you're talking about Skyrim, which is running

49:17.200 --> 49:19.120
on old engine hard.

49:19.120 --> 49:22.320
I mean, the engine is the thing that is old in that now.

49:22.320 --> 49:24.480
Yeah, I've been used in multiple games.

49:24.480 --> 49:27.520
And so you see a lot of their modern games that they're putting out.

49:27.520 --> 49:31.840
They're still using that really old engine at being really buggy.

49:31.840 --> 49:37.360
Fallout 76, Fallout 4, like all of that stuff is still very buggy because they're using

49:38.000 --> 49:44.160
outdated engines to build this same thing can happen with, you know, using outdated

49:44.160 --> 49:45.040
hardware.

49:45.040 --> 49:49.360
It's you're going to run into bottlenecks somewhere, whether that be the engine that

49:49.360 --> 49:53.440
you programmed where I can't do the efficiencies I want because it just doesn't support it

49:53.440 --> 49:55.840
anymore or just whatever.

49:55.840 --> 50:02.560
And yeah, it story and the rest of the polish of the game does matter as far as like being

50:02.560 --> 50:04.560
accepting what you'll look past.

50:04.560 --> 50:09.440
Yeah, and that's and that's really what it and Mike Deaf says it in chat here is that

50:09.440 --> 50:13.840
the bugs aren't game breaking for the most part, but the game is genuinely fun and great.

50:13.840 --> 50:18.000
And honestly, from my perspective, I have to agree, like both those things can be true.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.640
I can sit here and say, yeah, the bugs are really disappointing.

50:20.640 --> 50:24.800
Like the fact that there are so many technical glitches still in the game, it's disappointing.

50:24.800 --> 50:28.880
And the fact that the switch is very obviously antiquated hardware at this point is disappointing.

50:29.600 --> 50:30.400
All that can be true.

50:30.400 --> 50:35.520
And I can still say, but damn, this game, I love what the open world stuff did for Pokemon.

50:35.520 --> 50:41.200
I really like it took a few hours of gameplay to really grow me because at first I wasn't

50:41.200 --> 50:44.080
sure because it was just so different from sword and shield.

50:44.080 --> 50:48.000
But damn, now that I spent a couple hours with it, I'm like, I really love what the

50:48.000 --> 50:49.680
open world stuff has done for Pokemon.

50:49.680 --> 50:51.840
And I really can't wait to see where it goes.

50:51.840 --> 50:57.520
Hopefully, the next generation on a like, swear to God, Gen 10 better not be for the

50:57.520 --> 50:58.320
switch.

50:58.320 --> 51:00.720
Gen 10 needs to be for the next Nintendo hardware.

51:00.720 --> 51:02.960
And I'm really looking forward to that.

51:02.960 --> 51:06.160
Actually, what I'm really, really looking forward to is the next Pokemon Legends game

51:06.160 --> 51:07.760
because they better fucking do one.

51:07.760 --> 51:09.600
And it also better not be on the switch.

51:10.320 --> 51:13.200
Because I want to see what they can do with more advanced hardware.

51:13.200 --> 51:17.280
Yeah, I'm just worried that like the the message that we're sending with that stuff in don't

51:17.280 --> 51:19.840
get me wrong, like, like I get it a great game.

51:19.840 --> 51:22.480
So it could be great, even though it has bugs in it and stuff.

51:22.480 --> 51:26.240
But also, like there are there were some glaring bugs.

51:26.240 --> 51:27.040
It's not like that.

51:27.040 --> 51:30.000
Oh, hey, I did this weird thing that normally people don't do it.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.360
It was an untested case that we found some bugs and stuff like that.

51:33.360 --> 51:37.600
We're talking like very blatant, very performance based bugs that they knew that they

51:37.600 --> 51:38.480
need to iron out.

51:38.480 --> 51:40.880
And I hope that they will eventually iron out.

51:40.880 --> 51:45.520
But some executives, some corporate executives at Game Freak made the decision that we're

51:45.520 --> 51:47.840
going to release this in the state that it is now.

51:47.840 --> 51:48.400
Yeah.

51:48.400 --> 51:52.480
And so that's what you have to keep in mind is that they made that mistake and they're

51:52.480 --> 51:55.200
like, well, I don't know, maybe the fans might not take to it.

51:55.200 --> 51:58.640
And now that you took to it, they're going to be like, oh, well, next time, you know,

51:58.640 --> 52:03.360
it it's not in perfect polished shape, but we're just going to release it anyways.

52:03.360 --> 52:05.120
And I worry that it's going to get worse.

52:05.120 --> 52:07.760
Yeah, I have with other franchises.

52:07.760 --> 52:09.120
Yeah, that kind of thing happened.

52:09.120 --> 52:11.040
That is an industry problem.

52:11.040 --> 52:12.480
I absolutely agree with that.

52:12.480 --> 52:16.400
And it's one of those things where oftentimes people want to say, oh, the industry has this

52:16.400 --> 52:18.240
problem, but not Nintendo, not Nintendo.

52:18.240 --> 52:18.800
They're there.

52:18.800 --> 52:23.280
And I understand Pokemon is technically not a Nintendo game, but we literally just had

52:23.280 --> 52:27.920
Loki say it is Nintendo's biggest franchise officially as so.

52:27.920 --> 52:32.080
So yes, Pokemon and Nintendo are very much embedded together.

52:32.080 --> 52:33.520
It is a Nintendo company.

52:33.520 --> 52:34.080
I'm sorry.

52:34.080 --> 52:34.960
Yeah, I know.

52:34.960 --> 52:40.720
Do we publish Pokemon games on other platforms, other console platforms, iOS, Android, Nintendo

52:40.720 --> 52:41.920
company, iOS, Android?

52:41.920 --> 52:43.520
That is not a console.

52:43.520 --> 52:45.600
That is that is mobile games.

52:45.600 --> 52:46.320
I'm sorry.

52:46.320 --> 52:47.040
That doesn't count.

52:48.400 --> 52:51.120
It's it is a Nintendo company.

52:51.120 --> 52:53.280
It may be like a second party company.

52:53.280 --> 52:54.720
However, we want to distinguish it.

52:54.720 --> 52:58.560
But it is a company that makes games that are featured.

52:58.560 --> 53:00.480
And it's not only Nintendo game.

53:00.480 --> 53:01.360
It's not just go.

53:01.360 --> 53:03.120
It's Pokemon cafe.

53:03.120 --> 53:05.280
There's, I think, a trading card thing that's there too.

53:05.280 --> 53:08.160
So Pokemon does have a mobile space.

53:08.160 --> 53:09.840
But I get what you're saying.

53:09.840 --> 53:12.800
But yeah, you know, Loki and I will agree with what you're saying.

53:12.800 --> 53:14.240
This is an industry problem.

53:14.240 --> 53:16.560
And it's one that this game is exhibit A.

53:16.560 --> 53:18.160
Nintendo is not immune to it.

53:18.160 --> 53:21.760
We release games in buggy states because we need them to be out by a certain day.

53:22.320 --> 53:23.920
And that's what it is.

53:23.920 --> 53:28.080
By the way, an interesting fix that I read about and I haven't had a chance to test this

53:28.080 --> 53:34.640
yet, but I did notice that my game was running off of the SD card because that's where the

53:34.640 --> 53:38.400
game chose to install by default was my expansion SD card.

53:38.400 --> 53:43.120
Apparently, if you copy the game from the SD card, move it, I guess move it from the

53:43.120 --> 53:46.880
SD card to the system hardware, it will function better.

53:46.880 --> 53:48.320
I'm not sure why that is.

53:48.320 --> 53:52.320
It's not like these cards are plate drives that are spinning up that are causing lag.

53:52.880 --> 53:56.800
But I could see that even a couple microseconds of lag is lag.

53:56.800 --> 54:00.720
So I did move the game over to the system.

54:00.720 --> 54:06.000
I did that in some downtime because I actually did play a little bit off stream.

54:06.000 --> 54:10.640
But all I did off stream was I went to the academy and started advancing all those classes

54:10.640 --> 54:14.080
you can go to, like do some of that stuff that's just like pushing A to read through

54:14.080 --> 54:15.200
quest text over and over.

54:15.200 --> 54:19.520
I did some of that stuff off stream so I could not have to spend time on stream doing it.

54:20.160 --> 54:24.160
And so before I did that, I moved the game over because apparently that is supposed to

54:24.160 --> 54:25.120
reduce the bugs.

54:25.120 --> 54:28.880
I don't know if that's just urban legend at this point or what it is.

54:28.880 --> 54:32.720
No, I would imagine that that's probably a thing because it's the same.

54:32.720 --> 54:36.480
It's like when we were talking about running games off disk drives and installing to your

54:36.480 --> 54:40.000
hard drive back in the Xbox 360 days or PlayStation three days.

54:40.000 --> 54:45.120
Yeah, it's it's the drive speeds are it could even be the SD speeds are faster.

54:45.120 --> 54:53.440
You know, whether you have, you know, on on hardware flash RAM or whatever flash ROMs

54:53.440 --> 54:58.640
that you have in there that you can store that data to versus reading through an SD

54:58.640 --> 55:03.680
card slot, which is bottlenecked by, you know, that process as well.

55:03.680 --> 55:04.640
The bus on that.

55:04.640 --> 55:08.160
So it's it is very possible that that is the case.

55:08.160 --> 55:11.520
But that also goes back to that the hardware is not powerful enough.

55:11.520 --> 55:17.600
Also, the game's not optimized enough to be able to, you know, cache that basically loading

55:17.600 --> 55:18.160
in that data.

55:18.160 --> 55:22.480
That's why you have pop in and some of these open world games is because it can't read

55:22.480 --> 55:22.960
the data.

55:22.960 --> 55:29.040
They don't have it compressed enough or, you know, doing LEDs, whatever it might take to

55:29.040 --> 55:30.080
load that stuff in there.

55:30.080 --> 55:34.800
They're not doing it in an efficient enough manner because the hardware can't keep up

55:34.800 --> 55:35.280
with it.

55:35.280 --> 55:40.400
So either you either optimize the hell out of it to, you know, work on the, you know,

55:41.360 --> 55:47.200
lesser than ideal powered hardware, or you get more powerful hardware to run your game.

55:47.200 --> 55:51.520
Mike Defton chat says portable mode and installed on the console does run better.

55:51.520 --> 55:53.360
I personally tested it interesting.

55:54.080 --> 55:58.400
And then some other folks, multiple people in chat pointing out that SD cards can vary

55:58.400 --> 55:59.440
in speed.

55:59.440 --> 56:04.320
So it could also be a reason why it causes some of the issues that'll be interesting

56:04.320 --> 56:09.520
to see how much of an improvement I notice moving it to the but that just FYI, if you

56:09.520 --> 56:14.000
hadn't heard that yourself, and you're a Pokemon scarlet or violet player, that's a tip.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.280
Don't run it off the SD card.

56:15.280 --> 56:18.960
If you can help it, move it to the main console, you can you can use data management, your

56:18.960 --> 56:20.480
options and kind of move things around.

56:20.560 --> 56:24.480
You can even even uninstall things to download them later if you don't have a bandwidth cap

56:24.480 --> 56:25.120
to worry about.

56:25.680 --> 56:28.720
But I was able to pretty easily move things around to make that work.

56:29.280 --> 56:30.240
Your mileage may vary.

56:31.360 --> 56:33.120
Now I wanted to move to this story real quick.

56:33.120 --> 56:34.800
I know you probably have one other thing.

56:34.800 --> 56:36.960
Did you have one other thing you want to get out Logie with this?

56:36.960 --> 56:38.880
Yeah, just so that people are seeking refunds.

56:38.880 --> 56:42.880
I mean, yeah, if you're unhappy with the state of the games, and then sure, go seek

56:42.880 --> 56:43.520
refund.

56:43.520 --> 56:46.560
Yeah, I mean, that's just common sense, I would say.

56:47.360 --> 56:51.280
Well, the fact that they're getting them from Nintendo is the news there, in my opinion.

56:51.920 --> 56:53.040
This isn't a steam game.

56:53.040 --> 56:54.240
This is an epic store game.

56:54.240 --> 56:57.200
It's a Nintendo game, who are notoriously hard asses.

56:59.440 --> 57:06.400
I mean, I guess it's but it's not like, because I don't think it's unheard of.

57:06.400 --> 57:08.560
I mean, they know the state that it's in.

57:08.560 --> 57:12.080
They're not completely like what the games release in this.

57:12.720 --> 57:13.280
They know.

57:13.280 --> 57:14.080
I mean, come on.

57:14.080 --> 57:17.200
DJI who says, wait, Nintendo is giving out refunds.

57:17.200 --> 57:22.800
Apparently, yes, we are hearing cases of refunds, but we don't we don't know the policy.

57:22.800 --> 57:25.760
Nintendo has not come out to state any sort of policy.

57:25.760 --> 57:30.480
And they probably won't, knowing Nintendo, but I guarantee they're not going to.

57:30.480 --> 57:34.320
So we're really left off of tweets and Reddit posts.

57:34.320 --> 57:38.000
And you know, it's up to you how much faith you want to put in that type of stuff.

57:39.280 --> 57:42.720
Ironically, I have something about a Reddit post.

57:42.720 --> 57:45.760
So again, I'm just going to state this is from a Reddit post.

57:45.760 --> 57:48.000
So I'm not even sure if it's true or not.

57:48.720 --> 57:51.920
But I want to you know, it's a slower Newsweek.

57:51.920 --> 57:55.040
And it's one of those interesting things where I wouldn't be surprised if it's true.

57:57.040 --> 58:02.640
Apparently, one player on Reddit decided to go to Nintendo's customer support and revealed

58:02.640 --> 58:04.480
the response that they received.

58:04.480 --> 58:10.000
The employee claimed this was the first they'd heard about any issues with the games.

58:10.080 --> 58:13.440
And there are no patches or updates in place to fix the problems.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.160
This has now turned way I gotta say that.

58:16.160 --> 58:16.400
Hold on.

58:16.400 --> 58:16.720
Hold on.

58:16.720 --> 58:17.920
Look, I see the face you're making.

58:17.920 --> 58:18.880
I need to get through this.

58:19.600 --> 58:20.100
Sure.

58:22.720 --> 58:23.200
Number one.

58:23.200 --> 58:28.560
Now that is the headline that is running rampant through the industry is Nintendo does not

58:28.560 --> 58:31.760
plan to address Pokemon and Scarlet Violet issues.

58:33.120 --> 58:36.720
That is that that that is a bad headline to run.

58:36.720 --> 58:38.160
I'm going to tell you why.

58:38.160 --> 58:41.440
I guarantee this customer service support.

58:42.000 --> 58:46.080
They have a book, they have a Bible, they have a line, they have to stick to it.

58:46.080 --> 58:49.680
I'm not saying the line that they have to stick to is to lie about the technical support

58:49.680 --> 58:50.480
with the game.

58:50.480 --> 58:55.440
But the line they have to stick to is there are no patches at this time plan for Scarlet

58:55.440 --> 58:56.080
and Violet.

58:56.080 --> 58:59.280
They can't come out and say, Oh, yeah, well, we'll give that to the team to do a patch.

58:59.280 --> 59:04.400
Well, they they can only say what they can say and they can only know what they know,

59:04.400 --> 59:10.080
which one week after the game is out during the Thanksgiving holiday in the US is take

59:10.080 --> 59:11.920
away not fucking much.

59:12.800 --> 59:19.360
So this is a really shitty headline to pull out of a Reddit story interaction with customer

59:19.360 --> 59:24.320
service who doesn't have the script to deal with the situation yet.

59:24.320 --> 59:25.440
That is the reality.

59:26.800 --> 59:32.160
So, but now and then people are saying no, no complaints have been filed about Scarlet

59:32.160 --> 59:36.160
Violet, that part I actually would see is true.

59:37.440 --> 59:43.760
Why why complain through the proper channels when you can just bitch about it on social

59:43.760 --> 59:44.160
media?

59:46.080 --> 59:51.440
So the Reddit Redditor says I filed a complaint about Scarlet Violet performance with Nintendo

59:51.440 --> 59:52.240
support today.

59:52.240 --> 59:55.680
And I encourage anyone who has had issues with the frame rate clipping game crashes,

59:55.680 --> 59:58.480
stuttering, lagging, etc to file a complaint as well.

59:58.480 --> 01:00:02.000
That is the part of the story I would actually agree with.

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:07.520
If you really feel passionately about it, register a formal complaint that is going

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.440
to force Nintendo's hand more than anything.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:09.920
Oh, God.

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:14.480
Now I'm just realizing as I'm reading through this entire post, I was able to speak with

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:21.600
a real person in the chat feature that everything I just said 60 seconds ago, even worse chat

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.560
feature.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:30.160
I I can't prove it, but I would almost certainly I would bet money it's offshored.

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.360
And those folks really have a script on what they can and can't say.

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:42.240
So Mike Deaf says let me guess Kotaku actually no, but I'm not surprised they ran with the

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:42.960
headline either.

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:46.800
This particular article I got pointed to is from the gamer.com.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:51.200
But I'm telling you, put it in Google News, you'll find 50 start sites that turn this

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.880
Reddit post during a slow newsweek into a headline.

01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:01.520
And again, there are some pieces of this that I do think are worth saying.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:06.400
So the one part where I will say, yes, Redditor, you're right, is filing a complaint about

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.160
Scarlet Violet performance with Nintendo.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:11.520
That is the only way something will actually get done about the situation.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.240
But this whole customer service told me this.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.760
Therefore, it must be true.

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.280
And I don't fault the Redditor for this.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.720
This isn't me picking on them.

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:25.440
This is me just saying the reality is you're talking to customer service who is probably

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:31.440
contracted with a company, Nintendo, that is not even the company that made Pokemon.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.520
But again, we all associate them with it contracted.

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:38.560
You are literally talking to a ditto of a ditto.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.320
And I'm not even intending to use Pokemon terms, but I guess I did.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:46.560
You are talking to a ditto of a ditto, probably a ditto of a ditto of ditto, because there's

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:49.280
probably another contractual agreement between offshore and the customer service.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:52.320
You're talking three dittos deep with customer service.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:59.200
Of course, they don't have shit to say to you, but they'll register their ticket in

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:02.400
Salesforce and somebody will get back to you in seven to ten days.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:09.600
Mike Defton chat says, as a person who worked at customer service calls for a US company,

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.120
scripts are the name of the game.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:15.040
And remind us where you live, Mike Deft, Mexico.

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:15.540
Yep.

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:19.840
Fifth Dream says, yeah, contracted with a third party even, so they don't even technically

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:20.880
work for Nintendo.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:23.040
And it's Game Freak's game, not Nintendo's game.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.480
So we're three dittos deep.

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:28.000
SSG100Matt says, a mimic you of a ditto.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:29.540
Yeah.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.280
Tiger Claw says, you probably are talking to someone from India.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:38.080
Perhaps could be the Philippines, could be a number of offshore places that are very

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:38.880
popular.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.480
It could be another part of the US.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.560
Sometimes offshore is still within the US.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.120
I'm not going to make that stuff up right now in the moment.

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:51.280
But all I'm going to say is, again, as far as reporting off customer service statements

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:56.400
go, gaming journalists of the world do not report on customer service interactions.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:57.200
It is not news.

01:02:58.480 --> 01:02:58.980
It's not.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.360
You all should know better.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.600
How fucking long have these websites been around?

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:09.120
Making articles based off of like a Reddit post is kind of lame anyways, or the ones

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.440
that report off of like a single tweet.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.760
Have you ever really looked at those Facebook ads you get all the time?

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:20.160
They are all like it's you would never believe what happened to these 10 celebrities.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.360
Number five will shock you.

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:26.000
And it is literally all Reddit posts compiled into a news story.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.040
This is like where journalism is at these days is Reddit posts.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.480
It's and tweets.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.320
Tweets is the other big one as well.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:36.800
Y'all know I have some strong feelings about Twitter and how really tweets should not be

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:43.920
news at this point, because we know that, you know, literally they will let little literally

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.760
anyone back on Twitter.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:54.000
And by verification for eight dollars, so gaming industry, if you're going to report

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:00.400
on tweets from here on out, that's y'all's ass like that's y'all's ass.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:05.840
We as podcasters, you, me, Dark Sakura, everybody out there that wants to have a respectable

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:06.720
gaming podcast.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.880
And I say I say this full on self-aware.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.720
We have made this mistake in the past.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.640
So I'm going to own those mistakes in the past.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:18.320
I'm going to say moving forward, we need to fucking watch if we report on Reddit posts

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:18.960
and tweets.

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:21.040
And if we do, we need to say so.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.720
So we can take it with a big grain of salt.

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:25.760
And that's why I started this was saying take this with a grain of salt because it comes

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:26.480
from a Reddit post.

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.360
No offense to Reddit.

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:30.320
I love Reddit.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:30.820
Most of it.

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:35.680
There's some pretty shitholes in Reddit, but most of Reddit.

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:36.480
I really enjoy.

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:42.240
And, you know, you do get a lot of really interesting stories and you get a lot of people

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:45.760
willing to tell you things on Reddit because they can hide behind a name that they wouldn't

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.120
say, you know, somewhere else.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.840
So it does lead to some fascinating stuff sometimes.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:50.880
That's for sure.

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.480
So let's see.

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.120
Looking in chat.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:01.200
SHO 100 Matt says the logic is like I talked to a DIS customer support person in a chat

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.400
window about DW.

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.520
I'm assuming Disney World.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.040
So I spoke to Bob Iger.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.200
Yeah, did your own?

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.000
Oh, excuse me.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.280
Quest Buster says, Yes, YouTube, you won't believe what happened in X Games Syndrome.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:18.960
Oh, God, you want to talk about another cesspool of Reddit posts becoming clickbait to get

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:19.600
your ads?

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.120
It's that.

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:25.280
So anyway, just throwing that out there.

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:26.240
Just throwing that out there.

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.120
Okay, let's move on.

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:30.800
Let's change the topic a little bit.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.480
Let's talk about other parts of Nintendo that make us scream internally.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.640
Loki or externally, thanks to Loki.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.200
Yes, Nintendo and their litigious side.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.320
Of course, you got to love it.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:52.800
So Nintendo is now coming after people with DMCA takedowns regarding fan created steam

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:53.440
icons.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.560
It's a user database called Steam Grid DB.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:04.560
And I believe custom icons that you can get for I'm assuming big picture mode and for

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:08.880
different like games that you want to have in your library that maybe you obviously steam

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:10.240
doesn't have in the library.

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:14.880
So you can use those or maybe you just want to put legends of the breath of the wild on

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.040
among us or something like that.

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:17.760
I don't know.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:25.760
But it is allowing you to basically, you know, put those different game cover arts or whatever

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:29.120
on or you can import them into your library.

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:34.880
Well, now they're, they're, of course, doing copyright notices, because, you know, there's

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:39.120
official artwork in there from Nintendo, and they don't want it to be related to with a

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:47.200
site that is not facilitating emulation, per se, but it's just like, we're adding some

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:50.480
dressing to your emulation that you're doing, I guess.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:58.080
So right now, they are taking down just basically anything that's using display Nintendo characters

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:04.080
or intellectual property that could be likely to lead consumer confusion.

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:10.960
And then of course, this has been the site has actually taken some of the stuff down as well.

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.480
And right now, they're not kind of going after stuff.

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:15.680
It's like fan art.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.400
But I mean, I wouldn't rule that out at this point.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:20.960
I don't know.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:21.760
I'm not surprised.

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.440
But also, like, really,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.120
you brought up fan art.

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:30.400
And I'm waiting for the day when Nintendo sues one of those fan boosts at a convention

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.480
or something that's producing artwork based I mean, they let's be real, we know they've

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:40.160
turned a big, you know, they've turned their back big time to that sort of thing.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.840
And they don't look directly at it.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:44.560
And we all we all worry when that shoe is going to drop.

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:48.240
But maybe they also realize that something like that.

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:51.520
Maybe that is where they know the line is that that really would do more harm than good.

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:53.840
But well, yeah, I'm all that stuff.

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:55.280
All that stuff is on borrowed time.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.840
Let's just let's just be real artists in the world.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.280
I'm being real with you.

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.240
Love what you do.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:00.880
Love your work.

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.240
Love your interpretations.

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.000
Y'all are on borrowed time.

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:12.080
Well, just I don't know, I think I think nothing will happen to Nintendo is what I think.

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:16.880
Honestly, like at this point, they can release buggy games, they can be litigious like crazy.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:18.340
Do we not?

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:23.920
Do we not remember that not literally a few years ago, they had a process where you couldn't

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:29.120
even make YouTube videos unless you signed up with their service, and then they would

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.640
still take all their ad revenue.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.320
This is a company that you're dealing with.

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:33.440
You guys all love them.

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:36.640
You're going to buy their games no matter what we're going to do literally whatever

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.320
they want, and you're going to just eat it up.

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:42.880
So I will say, Logie, there is how quickly we forget.

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:46.800
Gamers have also shown they are willing to not buy Nintendo.

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.480
Wii U says hello.

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:50.580
So.

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:55.680
You know, yes, they've had the magic touch with the switch and the Wii and, you know,

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:56.000
Liza.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.760
But let's be real, Loki.

01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.920
The Wii U is a blemish on Nintendo.

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.760
Yeah, one that's like decades old, though.

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:06.400
So I mean, decades, not decades.

01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:07.200
It feels that.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.400
Stop the revisionist history.

01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.280
You read that on Reddit.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:12.640
How old I feel.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:15.280
Okay, well, that that I accept.

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.160
It's one console.

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:20.080
Like, I don't think it matters.

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.560
It really doesn't matter at this point, because that's in the past.

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:23.060
Yeah.

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:24.420
All right.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.840
Well, moving on to something maybe less controversial.

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:28.160
I don't know.

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.880
I think I think this is DLC that doesn't ruffle a lot of feathers.

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:34.080
I will say that actually, let's let's be real.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:37.120
We've had a lot of of hard feedback for Nintendo.

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.920
I'm going to spotlight something I think Nintendo does very well.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.240
I think Nintendo does DLC very well.

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:46.720
I think they are almost ahead of almost any other company I

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:50.160
can think of off the top of my head when it comes to DLC and

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:53.040
the robustness and the richness and the quality of what you

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:53.760
get in DLC.

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:59.200
And we know that Mario Kart 8 is getting a lot of DLC lately,

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:04.800
and they're getting a new booster course pass with Wave 3

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.760
is coming out.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:09.200
And Wave 3 of the booster course pack will include the

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:13.280
Rock Cup and the Moon Cup, which includes London Loop from

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:17.520
Mario Kart Tour, Boo Lake from GBA, Rock Rock Mountain from

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:21.280
3DS, Maple Treeway from the Wii, and then the Moon Cup is

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:24.080
Berlin Byways, also from Mario Kart Tour.

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.480
I'm glad Mario Kart Tour can do something for the franchise,

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.480
because it's single handedly.

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:30.320
I think every track for that game is going to end up in this

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:30.820
DLC.

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:36.400
Peach Gardens from the DS, Merry Mountain, which was also

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:40.080
from Mario Kart Tour, and Rainbow Road, the 3DS version.

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.600
So if you don't already have the booster course pass, you

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.360
can get that for 25 bucks.

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:48.160
And that is for all six sets, 48 new tracks.

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:53.040
This particular set will be coming out December 7th, so

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.240
pretty soon.

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:56.240
So there it is.

01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:57.840
Mario Kart 8 DLC.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:02.800
I gotta admit, this is a very typical middle of the pack.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.120
I'm not sure if I'm excited about anything in this,

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:06.080
particularly.

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:07.680
None of these courses.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.960
I remember the Maple Treeway.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:09.920
That one was all right.

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.640
And actually, the Merry Mountain does look pretty cool,

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.800
because it has a Christmas train that goes through it and

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:15.360
stuff.

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:18.240
And so it gives me big, like, what was that course on

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.800
Nintendo 64 that has the train in it?

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.320
It gives me big that vibes.

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:25.920
So it was just in the last DLC.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.600
Yeah, I was gonna say that course in the last one.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:28.320
Desert.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:28.820
Yeah.

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:32.560
But this one, I'm pretty sure many of you already plunked

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.800
down the money for the six pack course.

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:38.160
These will be new courses to play at your Christmas

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:41.840
gatherings and other holiday gatherings, of course, too.

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.600
I don't want to neglect any other holidays out there.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:48.880
But yeah, I don't think there's nothing in here that jumps

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.800
to me like, wow, I've got to have that.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.200
It's not like Waluigi pinballs in this one.

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:54.000
That was in the last one.

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.560
It's kind of disappointing to like, I get it.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:58.640
Like, and then maybe they're saving it for Mario Kart 9

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:01.120
or whatever the case may be, even though they are making

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:03.040
like stuff throughout, I think, next year, too.

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.640
It is disappointing to see that they haven't really made

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:10.080
any tracks based off, like Odyssey or anything like that.

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.600
Like, I think that would be really cool.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.560
New tracks is basically what you're saying.

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:15.280
You want new tracks?

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:15.680
Yeah.

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:15.920
Yeah.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:18.320
New tracks, not just porting over everything.

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:22.400
We did get one or two new tracks in the first and second pack.

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:26.000
I don't know if they were just probably Mario Kart tour.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.720
I bet a lot of these new maps are Mario Kart tour maps that

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.840
got repurposed or they were going to be for tour.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:34.480
And then they decided, no, we're going to move it over here.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.920
So but, you know, I have no proof.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.160
That's just, you know, old man insight.

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.000
So, yeah.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.920
But yeah, I think we deserve Mario Kart 9.

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:51.600
But at this point, I hope Mario Kart 9 is a launch title

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:52.560
for the next system.

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:55.200
And I would think that would be a hell of a launch title

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.040
for a successor to the Switch.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:01.040
I think that would be a hell of a launch title, especially

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:03.920
if a Zelda game is not going to be ready, which unless you

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:07.840
want to buy into the rumors that, you know, I keep wanting

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:11.200
to say Breath of the Wild 2, but it has a name now.

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:13.520
The Weeping is the Breath of the Wild 2.

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:15.440
Oh, my God.

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:16.720
I can't remember the name of something.

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:17.760
Tears of the Kingdom.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:22.400
Tears of the Kingdom is going to be dual whatever, whatever.

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.720
But we'll see.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:25.840
Thank you.

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:26.480
Thank you, chat.

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:30.160
Yes, because that's never, like, backfired on a system ever.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.640
A dual release.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:36.400
I mean, Breath of the Wild was a Wii U game.

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.240
I understand that.

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.240
And it's probably held back because of that.

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.680
It's hard to look at a game like Breath of the Wild and say

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:47.680
it's held back at all, though, to be honest.

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:51.840
Like, that game is still holding up as one of the best games

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.600
that's on the Switch at this point.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:54.880
So we'll see.

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:55.840
All right.

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:57.440
Moving on, Loki.

01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:00.240
So this is cool.

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:05.040
Once again, you know, convincing me that maybe I don't need

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:08.480
a PlayStation because the games will eventually come to PC,

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:09.760
and that may be the case.

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:18.400
So as part of, I think, an interview with the Kazunori Yamauchi

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:22.400
about the whole 25th anniversary of Gran Turismo,

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.240
I believe it was asked that,

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.640
hey, do you see Gran Turismo ever being brought to PC?

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:31.200
Because, you know, some of the other Sony franchises,

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.520
like God of War and Spider-Man, Uncharted, whatnot,

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.440
have it come to PC.

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:39.680
And he actually said, yeah, I do think so.

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:44.880
But there's, you know, right now, he says that Gran Turismo

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:47.920
is finally, to title is where we get into marketing speak.

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:52.960
There are not many platforms that can run in 4K 60 natively.

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:54.080
PC can, I'm sorry.

01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:58.240
So one way we may make that possible is to narrow down

01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:58.960
the platform.

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:02.080
It's not a very easy subject, but of course, we are looking

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.280
into it and considering it.

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:06.720
Dude, a PC can handle that.

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:07.440
Come on.

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:11.840
I mean, a PC could easily do that, but whatever.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.120
I mean, obviously they probably don't have plans right now,

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.360
but it is certainly something that they'd be open to,

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:17.840
I'm sure.

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:20.400
So we'll see what the wait.

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.600
I'd like to play it on PC.

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:25.680
Again, my console gaming has gone way down since I got this

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:26.320
new PC.

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.880
I don't even touch everything I would play on Series X.

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.800
I pretty much play on the desktop.

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.560
And honestly, PlayStation five again.

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.240
It's really just about the exclusives.

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:38.160
I'm kind of bummed from SC 16 won't come out PC day one,

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.920
but it is, of course, of course not going to is what it is

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:42.480
at this point.

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:43.680
I'll get a PlayStation five.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:46.560
Sony's got to pay those or pay for those exclusives, you

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:46.880
know?

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:50.880
So I mean, it's only fair that they do it, but no one else.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.840
Sometime in the next few weeks, it's a holiday project I

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:54.080
have.

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:56.560
I'm going to be rearranging the space that I do the show

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:59.760
from my office because I'm actually going to put a tea.

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.040
I'm going to move things around.

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:04.320
So I actually have, I don't know how much I can show, but

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.560
I actually have off to the side where you see the burger

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.120
time cabinet.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.040
There's actually a closet over there.

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.960
That's like a walk-in closet.

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:14.640
I'm actually going to repurpose that walk-in closet as like

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.000
a mini arcade.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.120
So I'm going to move the burger time machine.

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:19.360
Great.

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.280
Now I'm not going to be able to get my camera backwards.

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:24.000
I'm going to move the burger time machine into that closet

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:28.400
and move some things around so I can get a TV here in the

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:28.880
studio.

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:34.640
And I'm going to rotate everything to make it happen.

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.760
So in the new shot for the show, you should hopefully see

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:41.840
the burger or the burger time machine and maybe future

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.120
expansion machines.

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:43.600
We'll see.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.200
We'll see behind me on the stream in the closet.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.320
That's the goal anyway.

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:50.880
I'm not going to be able to get this camera.

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:51.760
Remind me everyone.

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:56.080
I'm not allowed to touch the camera during the show.

01:16:58.320 --> 01:16:58.720
All right.

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:00.080
Sorry.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.200
This is terrible radio.

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:01.920
Help me, Loki.

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:03.360
All right.

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:04.320
I think we're good.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:04.800
All right.

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:05.040
Good.

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:05.600
Just in time.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:07.760
Looking in chat.

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:08.160
Yeah.

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:09.760
Rollercoaster ride on Rob's cam.

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:10.000
Yeah.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:10.400
Sorry.

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.360
Sorry to do that live, but I wanted to show that and I want

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.360
to get TV in here so I can do console gaming and that'll

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:18.320
make it also easy to stream more console games from in here.

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.560
If I want to do that.

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:22.240
So which I probably do.

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:23.520
All right.

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:24.240
Moving on.

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.640
Let's talk about a console classic.

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.400
The Xbox 360.

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.360
Yes, that's a classic.

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:34.080
Now, actually, what's also classic about this.

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:37.760
And I want to thank Matt and our discord over at vognetwork.com

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:38.480
slash discord.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.120
That's vognetwork.com slash discord for bringing the story

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:41.920
to our attention.

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.560
And that is that the company that brought back the Duke

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:50.240
controller that was the large concussion enabling Xbox

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:53.520
controller that was on the original Xbox, the company that

01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:56.880
brought this back is going to now bring back the Xbox 360

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:57.600
controller.

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:01.920
Hyperkin is the company and Xenon is the Xbox 360 controller

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:06.080
replica for the Xbox and PC.

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:09.280
It is an officially licensed replica of the controller,

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:09.760
believe it or not.

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.120
So that's what makes this notable.

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.000
What'd you say, Loki?

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:14.000
I said it's not different.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.880
Like the Xbox 360 controller has been the controller for

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:17.280
the last.

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:17.600
I know.

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.680
That's kind of where I was ending up with.

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:24.240
This is that honestly, y'all honestly, just get no disrespect

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:24.880
to Hyperkin.

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:26.320
I'm sure they're doing fine work.

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:29.040
Just get a fucking Xbox Series X controller and use it on

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:29.600
your PC.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:30.640
Like, it's great.

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.320
I do it all of the time.

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:35.200
Yeah, I literally have my controller right here.

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:37.120
And you'll notice it's plugged in because you can do that

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:39.840
through a standard USB port.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:43.680
And I play dead by daylight with my controller and other

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:45.120
things to vampire survivors.

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:50.000
I play on the controller, so it's very, very easy to do.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.280
Yeah, I kind of feel this.

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:52.480
You'll see the point.

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:53.200
Where's the Duke?

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.160
I understand because that's a completely different design

01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:56.800
for the controller.

01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:01.760
But like, this has been the standard for years now.

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:02.400
Yeah.

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:05.200
Now, just keep in mind the controller is being made with

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.120
the Series X and S in mind.

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:09.920
So the start and the back buttons, they were replaced some

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:12.080
time ago with menu and view.

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:14.640
So those are now mapped that way.

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:16.960
And then there is still a share button in the middle of

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:17.920
the controller.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.040
I don't think it was that on the original 360.

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:25.200
I think it was something else because the X button was still

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:25.840
a button.

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:27.280
But yeah, I think the share button is new.

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:29.040
So they just kind of added that there in the middle of the

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:30.400
controller, but doesn't really get in the way.

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:33.120
So there you go.

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:34.320
That is something available.

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:38.000
But again, get a Series X controller to be honest.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.800
Zen Monkey says, what Xbox controller works with the PC?

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:41.280
All of them.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.480
If you still have a working 360 controller, you can plug

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:44.880
that in.

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:49.600
Not all games may use it natively, but most will.

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:54.640
And then especially Xbox One and Series X, you can use any

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:54.960
of them.

01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:57.600
So yeah, I just like 360.

01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:01.520
You have to be careful because if you want to use a wireless

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:03.680
one, you have to have a dongle for that.

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:07.280
That's the only thing because those weren't Bluetooth back

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:07.680
in the day.

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:09.920
Wired, it should work just fine.

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:15.200
But anything like Xbox One and newer, it's all compatible.

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:16.000
It's all the same.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:16.500
Yeah.

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:19.680
So and then I noticed in chat, they're talking about the D

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:20.480
pad on the three.

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:26.880
I didn't love the D pad on the 360, but I think the one on

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.560
the Series X is way better.

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.400
But I guess your mileage may vary.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.640
You're welcome to your opinion on whatever one you prefer.

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:34.720
And that might be the reason why somebody wants to kind of

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:37.360
go back to that classic 360 feel.

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.640
So there you go.

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:40.000
All right.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.320
Let's get to our next segment.

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.640
We're going to do the classic game of the week.

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:45.920
I'm going to play the bump here.

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:50.000
And as promised, Loki is picking this week because Dark

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.840
Soccer is still not here and I picked last week.

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:54.880
So it's only fair that Loki gets to do this week's game.

01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:57.200
But first, let's do the lovely introduction.

01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:10.720
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:14.320
I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:15.200
you about it.

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:18.400
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:20.320
And tonight's pick is so good.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:22.000
Loki, what did you pick?

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:25.120
So I picked Sneak King.

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:29.840
This is a game for the Xbox 360 and actually the original

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:33.520
Xbox, because both consoles would play the same disc.

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.320
It was great.

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:35.040
It was an average.

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:36.880
A lot of people didn't know that because the box looked

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.160
like 360, right?

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.680
Yeah, because it was.

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:40.480
It was.

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:44.080
Yeah, it's it actually says on the box that you can do that.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:45.280
And it was kind of neat.

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:47.440
And I think it did try it and it actually works, too.

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:48.000
It's pretty cool.

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:54.000
But it is it was an advert game that was one of three that

01:21:54.800 --> 01:22:02.080
they released during 2006, and it was developed by Blitz

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:02.880
Games.

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:05.600
And this was a promotion that actually, funny enough,

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:08.800
happened right around the same time in 2006 between November

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.720
19th and the 24th.

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:14.800
Blitz Game, also Blitz Game Studios, I should say.

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:19.040
They're also known for some other games, including the Fairly

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:22.960
Odd Parents, SpongeBob SquarePants, but also Close to

01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:26.000
To Our Hearts, the Karaoke Revolution games.

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:27.360
Oh, wow.

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:29.360
I did not realize they did those games.

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.000
How funny.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.600
They they did those games.

01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:32.160
That's right.

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:38.880
So the game has you playing the king, the mascot of Burger

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:42.960
King, and you're tasked with sneaking around creepily and

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:45.680
delivering four different types of Burger King meals to

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:46.560
hungry people.

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:50.800
And it had different levels like the sawmill, the cul de

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:55.680
sac, construction zone, downtown, different unique

01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:58.960
characters and challenges that were in there.

01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:03.840
There's also a two game modes, free play and challenge.

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:08.880
Free play had you actually undertaking different challenges

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:12.880
and then I guess you could and you could also explore the

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:15.360
area without noise or site detection.

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:18.240
So it was kind of a little bit easier to play that.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:20.240
And then, of course, challenge mode was like the full game

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:23.520
there. It was great.

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:24.480
I love this game.

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:27.920
So I bought all three.

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.040
I don't know where they are.

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:33.840
The only one I think I saw, I had like Pocket Bike Racing

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.200
was one of the ones that they did.

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:36.880
And also Big Bumpin was a big bump.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:40.800
And I remember that one because the Pocket Bike racing had

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:44.880
some conventionally attractive lady on the front cover.

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:46.800
And like the Burger King characters were all relegated to

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:47.360
the back.

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:47.920
Like, what was that?

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.720
I was like a really not great target.

01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:55.200
I don't remember, you know, stereo audience.

01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:58.480
I think it was actually like a person on there.

01:23:58.480 --> 01:23:59.040
Oh, was it?

01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:02.880
I just was looking at the footage of Sneak King.

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:05.520
I love the way the King walks in this game.

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:09.360
This was actually in my top 10 for 2006 games.

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:12.480
I remember we did a thing on the show and I remember my

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:15.280
big controversial pick was this game in my number 10 slot

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:19.280
because it is absolutely one of the best adver games ever.

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.040
It was four dollars.

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:22.160
It was four dollars.

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:25.120
Like, name a game that has that good a value.

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:26.800
Okay, Vampire Survivors, name another.

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:28.560
It was still worth it.

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:30.000
It was still worth it.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.840
You know, I honestly and they had talked about it.

01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:37.680
I think doing like another line of these games as well for

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:39.360
like the Xbox one or something like that.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.120
I really wish they would.

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:42.480
I wish they were free.

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:44.080
I would buy them up instantly.

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:46.160
They were just ridiculous.

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:47.760
And I was trying to explain to my kids.

01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:48.640
It was yesterday.

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:51.520
Like we went to Burger King, actually, or Friday.

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:53.920
I think we went to Burger King and like did all that.

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:56.160
And I was trying to explain to them that they made games

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.600
based off of this stuff.

01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:57.840
Wow.

01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:00.240
But again, trying to explain to them what Sneak King was.

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:02.960
And it's it's just funny.

01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:05.040
But yeah, and I'm sure your kids are like,

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:09.040
Dan, this is not as funny as you think it is.

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:11.600
Oh, it's absolutely just as funny.

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:14.960
But yeah, like the little flourishes you can do

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:15.920
and stuff in the game.

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:16.880
It was fantastic.

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:21.520
But yeah, unfortunately, they never did, you know,

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:23.760
end up doing sequels for this.

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:26.480
But I think it was certainly well received.

01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:29.920
I don't know what the sales were on this, but I got to admit,

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.200
like, I think, oh, here we go.

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:31.700
Here we go.

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:39.120
So apparently the this is yeah, the games were oh, was $4.

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.920
So $3.99 and came with the Burger King meals.

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:47.280
And then they said in they sold 2.7 million copies

01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.400
during the promotion.

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:51.600
And it was also reported that they said 3.2 million copies

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:54.960
were sold, although there is like different numbers.

01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:58.320
So somewhere around 3 million copies of these games are sold.

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.080
That's crazy.

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:00.720
That's incredible.

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.160
GameSpot gave it a 5.8 out of 10.

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:05.760
IGN.

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:08.960
I don't know what they gave the game for that,

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:10.320
but yeah, it's funny.

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:12.080
Who cares what they thought?

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:15.200
They didn't even have to go to Burger King.

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:16.480
They were probably sent the games.

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:19.520
They didn't have to, you know, eat a mediocre burger

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:22.800
and questionable french fries to, you know, get this product.

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:23.520
So who cares?

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:27.120
Adam Sessler gave it a one out of five.

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:27.600
Who cares?

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:31.360
I don't care because this game is a number one out of five.

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:31.920
In my heart.

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:32.420
That's right.

01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:36.000
And that is why it is the classic game of the week.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:36.960
Well said.

01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:38.880
Classic game of the week.

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:41.840
Sneak King, the Xbox 360.

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:44.240
Again, another one of those titles where I remember talking

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:45.920
about this game when it was new.

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:50.800
And here we are 16 years later revisiting it back.

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:51.680
It's a classic game.

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:53.200
Burger King.

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:55.200
We need you to remaster these games.

01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:55.600
Come on.

01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:58.000
We got to bring it to modern consoles again.

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:00.240
Just sneaking.

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:01.600
We don't have to worry about the other ones,

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:04.320
but like just sneaking, maybe a sneak king too.

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:07.840
And then, like, a couple other, you know, we do a sports game.

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:08.560
Bigger bumping.

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:10.080
Bigger bumping.

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:13.760
All right.

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:16.080
Let's check out some rapid fire news.

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:18.080
Some other quick headlines in our industry.

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:20.720
We'll get to release dates, a few more stories, and then

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:21.600
maybe some calls.

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.360
We'll see if anyone wants to call in tonight.

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.200
Let's move on, though.

01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:26.720
We do have some rapid fire news to get to.

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:28.080
Just a few quick headlines for you.

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:32.320
So I'm not a player of this game, but I've definitely seen

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:34.480
a lot of people play Disney Dreamlight Valley.

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:38.240
And apparently on December 6, you are going to be able to

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:40.480
play in the Toy Story realm.

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.000
So it's pretty cool.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.960
They're going to have Buzz and Woody in there.

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.920
And I think they even have the bedroom as well, or at least

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.160
some cosmetics that are from all that.

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:52.560
So that's pretty cool to see that come into the game.

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:54.320
So check that out very soon.

01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:57.360
And then this is kind of neat.

01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:01.760
The Tetris, the Grandmaster is finally coming to consoles.

01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:06.320
Thanks to that wonderful Arcade Archives series.

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:10.640
So you'll be able to play that pretty soon with all the

01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:13.040
wonderful features that you would expect from the game.

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:18.560
Almost 1000 levels and introducing the 20G mechanic.

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:22.720
So, yeah, that'll be coming out very soon.

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:23.840
Excellent.

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:26.880
One quick headline I have for you in rapid fire news is

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:27.920
about No Man's Sky.

01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:29.120
You know, I love this game a lot.

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.000
I talk about it a lot.

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:34.000
Patch 4.06 was released this week, and it included the

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.240
Nintendo Switch, which is great because there's been some

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:38.160
complaints about some performance things on the Switch.

01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:39.200
What a shock, right?

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.680
But apparently, actually, the performance stuff aside,

01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:44.160
apparently the game does run very well on the Switch, like

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:46.240
way better than people anticipated it to.

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:49.680
I haven't played it firsthand, so I can't say, but most people

01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:51.840
I know that are playing on the Switch are pleased with it.

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:56.560
So, yeah, that's why we're saying they can get No Man's

01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:58.880
Sky to run on the Switch and look pretty good.

01:28:58.880 --> 01:28:59.760
Yeah, I know.

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:00.320
I know.

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:01.600
All right.

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:03.760
Enough said.

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:06.560
But yeah, so I'm not going to read every bullet in this

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:09.200
because a lot of it is just bug fixes, especially when it

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:11.200
caused, like, broken loops and things like that.

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:14.560
And, you know, menus that didn't go to where they were

01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:16.960
supposed to go under certain conditions and things like

01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:19.040
that. So it's mostly a bug fix.

01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:22.000
But what I will mention with the No Man's Sky update is that

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.520
they are repeating something they did last year, and that

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:27.680
is the Expedition Encore.

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:32.800
So if you missed Expeditions 5, 6, 7, or 8, you can play

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:35.600
those again right now, at least the first one.

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:40.000
So Expedition 5 is live right now, and you can run that,

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.320
I believe, through December 11th.

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:46.480
Don't quote me on that date because I neglected to bring

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:47.600
up the calendar right in front of me.

01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:50.320
But they're going to be running each of them for about

01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:50.880
two weeks.

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:53.600
Me personally, I still need to finish 7 and 8.

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:56.000
So I will be participating in this as well because I did

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:56.960
not finish 7 or 8.

01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:58.640
I finished all the others, but not those two.

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:01.120
So I'm going to go back and do this.

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:04.800
This is also great for those of you that just started on

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:06.080
the Nintendo Switch.

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:09.360
Like, I believe Mich, if she's out there, she started on

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.720
the Nintendo Switch.

01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:14.000
So the Nintendo Switch fan base never got a chance at these.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.400
So this is a good chance for y'all to catch up.

01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:19.440
So that's pretty nice as well that is available.

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:22.160
So check that out.

01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:25.440
Quest Buster says I should try to get the Living Freighter.

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:26.240
It's so weird.

01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:28.240
The weird thing is, I don't remember ever getting that,

01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:29.600
but I beat number 5.

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:37.120
I went to, you know how I know, is I went to the Space Anomaly

01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:40.240
and I looked at all the unredeemed rewards and they were

01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:41.280
all for 7 or 8.

01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:42.320
But now y'all had me worried.

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:45.920
I feel like I thought I beat 5, but maybe not.

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:47.920
Quest Buster does point out there's probably a billion

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:49.120
base shortcuts to help.

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:49.760
Absolutely.

01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:53.280
But sometimes be careful because sometimes for the encores,

01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:54.880
they mix up the starting point.

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:56.640
They mix up the starting planet.

01:30:56.640 --> 01:31:00.960
They did that last year with 3, the one that was like you

01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:04.480
did 90% of the expedition on a singular planet.

01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:05.840
It was a very different way to play the game.

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:08.800
They mixed up the planet for the encores.

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:09.600
So be careful.

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:11.440
The encores are usually a little different because they

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:13.280
run in a tighter time frame.

01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:14.560
So they have to change some things.

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:17.760
I'm very curious how that roguelike expedition, which was

01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:18.160
bad.

01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:20.160
I'm not going to just because I enjoy the game.

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:21.360
I'm not going to make excuses.

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:22.640
That was a bad expedition.

01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:24.480
I'm very curious to see how they're going to adjust that

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:27.200
for the two week window, but we'll see because I have to

01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:29.360
beat it if I want to keep my streak up.

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:29.920
So we'll see.

01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:32.480
All right, moving on.

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:35.520
Let's check out some release dates.

01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:38.640
If any, I imagine this week is going to be very slow as

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:39.920
will be the trend through the rest of the year.

01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:40.400
But let's see.

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:40.800
Let's see.

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:43.440
How about release dates around the world, starting in the

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:44.160
US things.

01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:49.920
So we've got, let's see, soccer story, which is coming out

01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:53.440
on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:56.400
Xbox One, Xbox Series and Stadia.

01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:02.400
Gundam Evolution on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One

01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:03.680
and Xbox Series.

Also the Outbound Ghost coming to Nintendo Switch a little

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:31.760

Android.

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:53.440
Samurai Maiden on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and

01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:59.920
Spirit Hunter Death Mark 2 on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation

01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:00.240

The Walking Dead Saints and Sinners Chapter 2 Retribution

01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:07.680
on PC and PlayStation 4.

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:11.280
Really long title for the week.

01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:12.080
Yu-Gi-Oh!

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:13.040
Rush Duel!

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:14.800
Dawn of the Battle Royale!

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:15.840
Let's Go!

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:16.560
Go Rush!

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:19.120
Nintendo Switch.

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:24.560
The Kalisto Protocol on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,

01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:26.400
Xbox One, Xbox Series.

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:30.000
Early leaks are showing that that game is really buggy too,

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.000
but it is very common for review and pre-release things

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.520
to still have a lot of bugs.

01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:38.960
So we do want to be mindful that that game is not in its

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:39.440
final state.

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:43.680
There will be a day one patch as there is for any big game

01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:44.320
at this point.

01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:45.460
Yeah.

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:50.160
Marvel's Midnight Suns on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:54.720
And then last but not least, Need for Speed Unbound on PC,

01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:57.440
PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.

01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:57.920
That's it.

01:33:57.920 --> 01:33:59.520
All right, going to Japan.

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:02.000
We have a busy week on the Nintendo Switch.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.560
Again, the holidays fluctuate a little different in Japan.

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:07.280
So we do have this week on December 1st.

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:08.240
Shinigami!

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:12.480
Shibito Magire comes out on the Switch, as does Windstorm,

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:15.360
Samurai Maiden, also released in Japan.

01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:19.920
River City Girls 1 and 2 in a multi-language edition,

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:21.600
so you can run it in multiple languages.

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:23.120
Also comes out in Japan.

01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:23.840
Yu-Gi-Oh!

01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:26.000
Rush Duel, Dawn of the Battle Royale,

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.400
the same thing that Loki just pointed out,

01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.920
is obviously coming out in Japan as well.

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.680
Those games are big over there too.

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:34.640
Rune Factory 4 gets a re-release and a price reduction

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:35.140
version.

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:38.320
SIFU gets a release in Japan this week,

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:41.680
also in a multi-language version.

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:43.840
The Capcom Belt Action Collection,

01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:45.520
that's like the fighting game collection,

01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:47.920
that comes out in Japan in a price reduction.

01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:50.160
So it's already been out there, but it's price reduced.

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:53.200
This game is only out in English, which is interesting.

01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:55.360
It's called Let's Play Oink Games.

01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.760
And you might think, oh, is it a pig game?

01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:00.160
No, it's like a brand of like card and board games.

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:02.720
So it actually is kind of like a Clubhouse Games type of thing,

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:05.440
but around one company's games.

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:08.000
Deep Sea Adventure, Startups, Moon Adventure,

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.040
This Face, That Face,

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:10.560
those are some of the games that are available in that.

01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:12.080
So I thought that was kind of an interesting one,

01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:13.920
because I had not heard of that before,

01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:15.680
but maybe some of you in chat have.

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:20.080
Going to the PlayStation 5, we have Samurai Maiden

01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:21.600
is also out on the PlayStation 5,

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:23.360
River City Girls 1 and 2,

01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:25.040
Dakar Desert Rally is out,

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:27.200
as well as Session Skate Sim.

01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:31.120
And that's it for the PlayStation 5 this week in Japan.

01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:32.560
Since Dark Sakura's not here,

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.400
perhaps Loki will take us to Europe tonight.

01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:37.920
Yeah, we have the Doctor Who Duel Bundle

01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:40.800
that's on PlayStation, Xbox, and the Switch.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:44.000
Astro Knight on PlayStation and the Switch.

01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:48.000
We have new Joe and Mac Caveman Ninja

01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:51.840
on PlayStation and the Switch.

01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:56.640
The Kalisto Protocol on PlayStation and Xbox series.

01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:01.680
We've got Midnight Suns on PlayStation and Xbox.

01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:06.000
Last Days of Lazarus on PlayStation.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.720
And let's see, Need for Speed Unbound

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.400
on PlayStation and Xbox.

01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:13.920
And a few more here.

01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:18.960
Cobra Kai 2 Dojo's Rising on PlayStation, Xbox, and the Switch.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.520
And we've got the Eternal Cylinder on PlayStation,

01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:24.320
and then that's it.

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:29.200
All right, let's do a few more headlines.

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:31.520
We have four more stories before the show is done tonight,

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:35.120
but we are willing to take your calls and your emails.

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:37.520
Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com,

01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:40.240
although I don't think I saw any for this week, unfortunately.

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:42.480
But we always welcome your emails.

01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:44.480
Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com.

01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:46.080
We'll see if we get any calls tonight as well

01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:48.080
over on Discord in our green room.

01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:49.840
For now, we have some more stories for you,

01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:50.560
starting with Loki.

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:56.320
Yes, so the Sims 4's gallery has been updated

01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:01.120
to enhance its profanity filter.

01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:04.000
So there's been some instances they say

01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:06.480
our wholly unacceptable content has been uploaded

01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:08.320
to the Sims 4 gallery.

01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:11.040
This is our team has reviewed and made critical updates

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:14.640
to the profanity filter to prevent this

01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:16.480
from happening in the future.

01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:19.360
We are grateful for the community's vigilance

01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:22.160
in helping us identify these inappropriate uploads

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:24.480
so we can maintain a safe, creative environment

01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:25.280
for our players.

01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:29.920
And so, yeah, get your smut off of there.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.720
There's other places for that.

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:36.400
That's right, Reddit.

01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:37.440
We went over that earlier.

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:41.120
All right, moving on.

01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:44.800
You may not have heard of this company, Onoma,

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:49.680
but Onoma was Square Enix Montreal.

01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:52.240
But, you know, some studios changed hands and things.

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:55.520
So Onoma has announced that they will be shutting down service

01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:57.280
for four of their mobile games,

01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:02.240
including Hitman Sniper The Shadows, Deus Ex Go.

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:03.360
Is that like Pokemon Go?

01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:05.600
I have no idea.

01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:08.560
No, I think that's like that Hitman Go

01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:09.760
or something like that.

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:11.840
I think, remember the mobile games that they have

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:12.480
that were kind of...

01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:13.920
Well, there's Hitman Sniper is one game,

01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:15.280
and then Deus Ex Go is another game.

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:16.800
And I'm just joking.

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:17.600
Is that Pokemon Go?

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:18.400
I don't think it is at all.

01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:19.680
I think this is just go because it's mobile.

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:24.560
Arena Battle Champions and Space Invaders Hidden Heroes.

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.800
They are all going to be removed from the app store

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:28.960
in the Android store on December 1st.

01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:31.040
So this is like literally your last chance to grab it.

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:35.440
All the in-game purchases have been stopped on January 4th.

01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:37.840
You won't be able to play any of those games anymore.

01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:40.080
No refunds, all sales final.

01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:43.920
So whereas some companies, Stadia, refunded all the money,

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:48.080
Onoma already spent it, so they will not be refunding it.

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:50.560
And you can see more in an official tweet

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:52.640
that they published over at Studio Onoma.

01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:55.280
Square Enix Montreal, of course,

01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:58.000
they were originally founded in 2011.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.840
They mainly focused on mobile games,

01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:02.880
but they did have a pretty dedicated audience

01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:06.320
with these strategy games like Hitman, Tomb Raider, Deus Ex.

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:07.440
But of course, as we know,

01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:09.440
Embracer Group picked out the studio,

01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:13.360
and they're not saying that these games are unloading

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:14.560
because of this exchange.

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:17.200
You could probably infer that.

01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:20.240
But yeah, so Onoma is now the name of the studio,

01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:21.680
but it was Square Enix Montreal.

01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:23.760
So if you played any of those games,

01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:24.560
sorry for your loss.

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:27.920
Uh, let's move on.

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:30.240
And just a couple more stories, Loki.

01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:34.960
Yeah, so Rockstar Games is basically tightening up

01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:37.440
some of the rules that they have for role-playing servers

01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:40.400
within Grand Theft Auto Online.

01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:42.800
And this is not necessarily going to get rid

01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:44.160
of role-play servers per se,

01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:47.440
but it's more to crack down on NFTs

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:49.440
and people pushing crypto,

01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:52.400
different loot box sponsorships.

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:53.600
Because of course they are.

01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:59.840
Yeah, so apparently it says it doesn't,

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:04.400
right now the rules don't address

01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:06.320
or directly address virtual currencies,

01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:08.880
loot boxes, sponsorships, crypto, and NFTs,

01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:12.080
but they're bringing the existing single-player

01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:13.840
PC mod rules into play.

01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:17.200
So basically trying to,

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:22.880
they made the comment was that they're an extension

01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:24.880
of a rich array of community-created experiences

01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:25.920
within Grand Theft Auto.

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:28.800
We hope that those continue to thrive in a safe

01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:30.880
and friendly way for many years to come.

01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:34.800
But, you know, obviously they're trying to stop people

01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:37.120
from selling stuff within their games.

01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:40.960
I would imagine like maybe even out of game content,

01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:43.040
you know, selling different things with that.

01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:45.920
You know, basically saying that, you know,

01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:48.800
licensed music, sponsorship deals,

01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:50.160
loot boxes and stuff like that.

01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:53.360
You can't buy loot boxes, only shark cards.

01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:59.040
No loot boxes, only the officially sanctioned stuff.

01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:03.600
But yeah, so they've updated their policy,

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:04.720
basically saying that, yeah,

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
misuse of Rockstar Games trademarks

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.520
and game intellectual property,

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:15.120
importation or misuse of other IPs is not allowed,

01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:20.000
real-world brands, characters, trademarks, and music,

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.960
commercial exploitation, including the sale of loot boxes

01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:27.040
for real-world currency or an in-game equivalent,

01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:30.160
the sale of virtual currencies, generating revenue

01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:33.760
via corporate sponsorships or in-game integrations,

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:37.040
or the use of cryptocurrencies, crypto assets,

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:40.960
making new game stories, missions, or that.

01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:43.840
I can't make new game stories and missions and maps.

01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:46.320
Well, you probably can't turn around and sell them.

01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:48.400
I imagine it's the big thing they're trying to prevent.

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:50.160
I think as long as you don't sell it.

01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:52.800
Cracking down on bringing Grand Theft Auto IV

01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:54.160
into the five engines, stuff like that.

01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:55.780
Yep.

01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:59.440
So they're just cracking down on a few more things.

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:01.680
All right.

01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:05.200
Well, is that going to get you to play Grand Theft Auto online

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:06.640
if you know it's going to be NFT3?

01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:11.200
No, I wasn't playing it when it was NFT3.

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:14.800
So no, that ship is sale.

01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:16.400
It's going to be Grand Theft Auto VI

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:18.000
is what I'm going to be waiting for.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:18.640
All right.

01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:21.120
And hopefully, hopefully we get that sooner rather than later.

01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:23.920
But, you know, let's not hold our breath, shall we?

01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:26.080
Maybe at the Game Awards, we'll see.

01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:31.680
By the way, unfortunately, this year at VOG Network,

01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:33.440
we're not going to be doing a simulcast for that.

01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:35.840
Bobby Black Wolf is going to be out of town.

01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:38.240
And I actually agreed to host another show that night.

01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:39.680
I'm going to guest on another show that night

01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:41.600
because the usual host is going to be out.

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:45.280
So unfortunately, no co-stream.

01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:48.320
Loki, if you want to co-stream, you can do your Loki stream.

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:51.440
Yeah, unfortunately, nothing official here at VOG,

01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:52.400
unless Loki does it.

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:54.640
I have to see what time it is.

01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:57.040
4.30 Pacific, I believe is when it starts.

01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:59.200
But it's probably one of those 30-minute pre-shows.

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:00.960
Well, I would say of nothing,

01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:04.080
but I do feel like they did actually announce

01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.200
a lot of stuff previously.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.440
Anyway, that was a lot.

01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:08.960
But yeah, it'll be interesting.

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:10.020
All right.

01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:13.520
Last and sadly tonight, you know,

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:16.560
the world of pop music lost an icon this week.

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:20.160
Irene Cara, who you might recognize as the name behind

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:24.160
huge, huge 80s songs, including Fame and Flashdance,

01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:26.560
passed away this week at the age of 63.

01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:28.000
And you might be asking,

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.320
what in the hell does this have to do with video games?

01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:32.000
And my answer is a lot.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:32.880
Thank you very much.

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:38.000
Because remember, we all met playing Dance Dance Revolution.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.360
And sure enough, Dance Dance Revolution third mix.

01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:42.320
There is a cover.

01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:44.160
Oh, this came through loud.

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:45.680
Sorry, I didn't mean for it to be this loud.

01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:48.960
There's a cover of Flashdance.

01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:50.960
It's more of a speed mix,

01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:53.280
as was very popular in that sort of era.

01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:59.040
But yeah, the speed mix by Magica of Flashdance,

01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:00.080
what a feeling,

01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:02.720
sort of exposed a whole new generation to this song.

01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:05.920
And some people then discovered Irene Cara through that,

01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:09.200
who I do believe has a co-writing credit on this song.

01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:10.240
So there is that.

01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:12.160
Anyway, that's about the most of that song I can play

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:13.440
before I get somebody in trouble.

01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:16.640
But yeah, so Irene Cara obviously has a connection

01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:17.840
to Dance Dance Revolution,

01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:20.560
specifically third mix through that song.

01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:24.720
And if you don't like those songs in the first place,

01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:26.320
why are you so hateful?

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:28.240
Like those are just some amazing songs.

01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:30.080
You really have to kind of be sad.

01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:32.720
Like we didn't really hear other songs

01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:34.000
from her later in her career,

01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:37.040
but certainly she left her mark on 80s culture.

01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:40.080
Also, you might know Irene Cara from The Electric Company

01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:42.240
was where she was originally from.

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:43.920
I mean, you specifically,

01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:46.480
maybe your parents know them from The Electric Company,

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:48.400
but she was on that as well.

01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:51.920
She was in the movies Erin Loves Angela and Sparkle.

01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:53.840
And of course, we all know Fame,

01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:56.240
where she starred as Coco Hernandez in that movie.

01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:57.680
She had the record.

01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:00.160
She also had Out Here on My Own was a ballad.

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:03.280
She was nominated for a Golden Globe and two Grammys.

01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:05.920
And yes, Cara co-wrote the lyrics to Flashdance,

01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:07.920
What a Feeling, which was all over.

01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:11.360
She'd have some other songs later called Why Me and Breakdance.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.840
But she'll probably be most well-known

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:17.360
for her affiliation with Fame and all of that good stuff.

01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:19.840
So Dejirama S says Morgan Freeman

01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:21.120
got his start on The Electric Company,

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:22.240
if I recall correctly.

01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:25.760
Yeah, I think I did see on YouTube a clip of that.

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:28.720
So Zen Monkey said I had a major crush on her.

01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:30.400
Yeah, I know it's sad.

01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:33.760
Darted Suya says DDR definitely exposed me

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:35.360
to a lot of new music.

01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:37.440
Absolutely, absolutely.

01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:39.760
And so Irene Cara was one of those greats.

01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:41.680
So rest in peace.

01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:45.280
Let's get to the you part of the show

01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:46.560
where if you want to give us a call,

01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:49.360
you can join our green room over at vognetwork.com

01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:50.000
slash Discord.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.560
Again, that's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:56.000
Or you can always send us a message in our chat

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.720
over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:01.040
If you have something you want us to talk about

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:02.640
before we sign out for the night,

01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:04.480
let me check in with Loki.

01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:07.200
It's kind of a slower week with the US

01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:08.480
not running for the past three days.

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:10.400
But anything you want to throw out here

01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:11.280
for last minute stories?

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.040
There's nothing.

01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:13.360
Yeah.

01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:14.960
We were scraping at the bottom already.

01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:15.440
I know.

01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:16.320
We were kind of...

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:18.800
When we're turning Reddit posts into stories,

01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:19.920
you know it's a slow week.

01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:23.360
And the same is true of the sites you visit every day.

01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:25.520
They still got to get clicks in November and December.

01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:27.840
They got to make those ad folks happy.

01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:30.560
Have you experimented with any...

01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:31.280
Let me ask this question

01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:32.880
because this is something a lot of people are going through.

01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:34.320
And I promise I'm not going to make this

01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:36.080
a Twitter hate boner thing.

01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:38.800
You all know my issues with Twitter and why I deleted.

01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:39.440
I'm curious.

01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:43.280
Have you explored any of those alternatives to Twitter

01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:44.400
right now that are going around?

01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:45.520
What are your thoughts with all the...

01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:48.160
I don't want to say Twitter knockoffs

01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:50.080
because a lot of these things have existed for years.

01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:53.440
They're just coming to light because of what's going on.

01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:54.800
But what are your thoughts

01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:57.520
on some of the Twitter successors maybe?

01:46:58.240 --> 01:46:58.800
I don't know.

01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:02.160
I think I set up an account on Mastodon in Hive

01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:04.880
and that's about it as far as I've gone.

01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:06.080
You have Hive?

01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:07.120
Did I add you on Hive?

01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:08.880
I don't know.

01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:11.840
I have to find you if I haven't already added you.

01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:13.280
Yeah, I'm with Matt.

01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:14.480
I kind of like Hive.

01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:17.760
I don't love the layout on Hive

01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:20.080
because it feels more Instagram to me, which is fine.

01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:24.240
I like Instagram, but the photos take up so much space.

01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:28.560
One nice thing about Twitter before you know who ruined it

01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:30.160
was that it was very compact

01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:32.800
in the way it showed its information on Twitter.

01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:34.880
And I want Hive to be able to get to that point too

01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:37.200
where it can show the information on the screen compactly.

01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:39.600
But Hive's biggest issue right now

01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:41.600
is that there's no web client for Hive.

01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:43.840
And that leads to all sorts of accessibility issues

01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:47.680
for people too, which people are calling out about Hive.

01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:50.000
But we have to remember it's two people,

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.240
I think three that run Hive.

01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:54.640
And it was not intended to be a Twitter replacement.

01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:57.120
It just kind of is that right now for some people.

01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:59.360
So y'all got to be patient with Hive

01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:01.280
and understand many of the issues.

01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:02.320
They're at least acknowledging it.

01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:04.240
They're like, yeah, we need to work on accessibility.

01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:04.720
Okay, cool.

01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:05.600
They're acknowledging it,

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:06.960
but it's not going to be fixed tomorrow.

01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:08.320
So we'll see.

01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:12.480
I would be very curious watching all of these people flee

01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:16.160
if a big backer is going to get in there.

01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:21.440
I'm really curious if an Amazon, a Google,

01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:24.320
which would be wild, but I don't put them off the table.

01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:27.680
Let's come back, baby.

01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:31.120
I would be very curious if one of these big tech,

01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:32.960
well, an Apple themselves, who knows?

01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:35.360
What the fuck was that thing called?

01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:36.000
Wave?

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:36.880
No, that was Google.

01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:39.440
What was Apple's social media thing that flopped?

01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:41.840
It flopped hard.

01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:43.360
I don't want to think about that.

01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:48.480
Apple, it was built into iTunes at one point and it flopped.

01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:52.960
But anyway, my point is any one of these companies

01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:56.000
is going to buy Hive when they see how big it's getting.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.440
And it's going to be very interesting.

01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:04.000
But again, I would much rather welcome Apple taking over Hive.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.760
And I'm completely fanficking this.

01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:08.160
So, you know, insert big tech company here

01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:10.000
as opposed to what's going on at Twitter right now.

01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:14.400
I would completely welcome Amazon for God's sake.

01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:17.840
So Tiger Claw says Apple doesn't have a social media server.

01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:18.800
They did.

01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:19.200
They did.

01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:22.240
It was integrated into iTunes

01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:25.280
and they tried to get musicians to be on there.

01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:27.600
And it was a music based social feed.

01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:29.120
Somebody's going to know what I'm talking about.

01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:30.160
And then you all are going to know.

01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:34.640
You all are going to go, oh, yeah, that that came in.

01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:36.080
It was faster than Google Plus.

01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:37.040
What the hell is it called?

01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:45.520
Ping.

01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:46.560
It was called Ping.

01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:47.440
iTunes Ping.

01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:51.360
Orangewrite1 in chat.

01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:52.320
There it is.

01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:53.280
iTunes Ping.

01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:55.040
Yeah, I had to Google it real fast.

01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:57.280
And they discontinued it in 2012.

01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:00.080
Ping could be a classic game of the week.

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:04.320
That's how long ago Ping went away.

01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:11.040
But anyway, Hive is going to be interesting.

01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:13.440
The more and more people that flee to it,

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:16.720
the more and more somebody are going to throw those two women.

01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:19.520
I believe it was two women that started that company.

01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:21.680
They're going to throw those two women a lot of money.

01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:23.200
And it's going to be hard to say no to it.

01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:24.960
It's going to be like the wordle dude.

01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:30.480
The wordle dude is a great road map for what's about to happen to Hive.

01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:32.880
The other one is Mastodon.

01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:34.320
I like Mastodon.

01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:38.720
I'm well aware of Mastodon's moderation issues

01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:40.320
and some of the things that have happened over there

01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:41.600
that need to be worked on.

01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:46.160
It's a little interesting because it's so decentralized.

01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:49.920
I also don't think you should be throwing rocks at Mastodon

01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:51.760
from your Twitter account.

01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:55.360
When you are on a platform that is literally forgiving Nazis.

01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:59.520
And again, those of you that are staying on Twitter,

01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:00.160
I understand.

01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:01.120
I'm not judging that.

01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:06.080
I'm judging the people throwing rocks at Mastodon from Twitter.

01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:06.800
Big difference.

01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:07.600
I hope you see it.

01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:13.360
But I think Mastodon, the hardest thing is understanding it

01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:14.960
and getting the right client.

01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:16.720
And I finally did get the right client.

01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:21.040
For me on iOS, the client I use is called,

01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:23.280
I think it's meta text.

01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:25.520
So meta text.

01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:28.480
And once you get that, it looks a lot like Twitter, to be honest.

01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:32.720
But I actually love that you have a 500 character limit on Mastodon

01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:34.880
and it flows so much better.

01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:38.080
You can turn off retuts or whatever they call it.

01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:39.200
I really like Mastodon.

01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:41.440
It's just not enough people flocked to it.

01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:44.160
My feed feels really empty compared to what I had on Twitter.

01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:45.520
But I knew that was going to happen.

01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:46.240
It is what it is.

01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:48.880
I also really like co-host.

01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:52.000
But co-host has the exact opposite problem of Hive.

01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:57.520
Co-host only has a web app and no phone app.

01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:00.240
And to really have a successful social media platform,

01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:02.480
in my opinion, you need both.

01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:04.960
So hopefully co-host gets there.

01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:07.280
Co-host has serious live journal vibes.

01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:11.760
Serious live journal vibes, but like somehow streamlined.

01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:15.120
And I see the people that are like building games completely

01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:17.840
in co-host, which I think is really neat, which I think is

01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:19.440
what Orange Wright is referencing in chat right there.

01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:21.760
Because he's the one I see reblogging a lot of that stuff

01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:24.320
where there's like full on games that are built in co-host.

01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:25.360
So I like co-host.

01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:27.680
So I'm on Hive at Rob Roberts.

01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:31.440
The one nice thing about this is I'm getting to claim my name

01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:36.400
everywhere before some silly politician in Europe can do it.

01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:41.440
Because there's that guy that's named Rob and there's the DJ

01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:43.600
in Australia that's named that, the gun owner.

01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:45.440
So I'm getting my name before any of these other people

01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:46.560
that want to claim it.

01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:48.480
So I'm Rob Roberts on Hive.

01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:51.040
Rob Roberts at Mastodon.social.

01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:52.560
And then I'm Rob Roberts on co-host.

01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:56.800
So I'm all of them.

01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:59.040
Fifth Dream says, I'm just gonna go back to MySpace.

01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:00.320
IDGAF.

01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:02.400
Honestly, I still have a MySpace.

01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:03.200
There's space.

01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:03.920
There's space.

01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:06.800
Hey, Dartusuya was showing that one that there's space.

01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:08.960
Hey is literally MySpace without Tom.

01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:09.840
That's it.

01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:12.480
It's otherwise like literally just a redoing of MySpace.

01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:15.920
So, all right.

01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:18.800
No other calls seem to be coming in tonight.

01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:19.600
So let's yeah.

01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:20.720
Pod culture, same for me.

01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:22.400
I go on and I snag my name.

01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:24.400
That's why I'm like, I don't know which one of these is

01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:24.960
going to stick.

01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:29.280
Personally, there's a lot about Hive I like.

01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:32.000
There's a lot about co-host I like.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:33.440
There's a lot about Mastodon I like.

01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:35.200
There's things I like in all three of them.

01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:36.480
I love the fact that Mastodon is decentralized.

01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:37.920
Just have them all merge together.

01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:39.840
They can all like become one big company.

01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:42.480
Well, the Hive and the co-host problem is that somebody

01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:43.120
could buy them.

01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:44.400
Nobody can buy Mastodon.

01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:48.000
That's that's the most fascinating thing about it to me.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.560
So because it's decentralized.

01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:53.520
And now the fact that you have things like Tumblr says

01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:55.280
they're going to integrate with the Fediverse, which would

01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:57.680
mean you could get a Tumblr feed on Mastodon.

01:53:57.680 --> 01:53:59.680
And then another big one came out this week.

01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:01.680
And one of the photo services said they were going to do

01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:02.640
it as well.

01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:04.080
So it could be interesting.

01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:07.440
Orange writing chat says that's the thing I didn't understand.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:08.720
So pick a server.

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:10.560
I'm like, I don't know.

01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:11.600
Well, it's like email.

01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:12.800
Do you want Gmail?

01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:14.080
Do you want Yahoo?

01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:15.360
It's all email at the end of the day.

01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:19.360
But your server is going to dictate because, you know,

01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:20.480
basically who is running it.

01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:22.800
You do have to trust your server admin to like make the

01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:25.840
right moderation decisions and block the right servers.

01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:28.720
That's why Bobby Blackwolf on his show was like, I could

01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:31.200
make a VoG network Mastodon server.

01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:32.640
I do not want to run one.

01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:36.320
And I'm like, honestly, I get it.

01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:37.520
Say no more.

01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:39.120
Like you shouldn't have to run.

01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:41.600
That's a full time job to run a server like that.

01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:42.720
It takes a lot of work.

01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:44.880
There'd be too many moderation decisions and things like

01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:46.800
that. So I get it.

01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:47.360
I get it.

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:50.960
So all right, that's going to do it for tonight's Orange

01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:51.520
Lounge Radio.

01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:53.280
I know it's a little bit shorter of a show, but hey, it's

01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:53.760
a holiday.

01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:54.320
What can we do?

01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:57.040
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts and

01:54:57.040 --> 01:54:58.320
wrap it up for tonight.

01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:00.240
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,

01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:02.240
tell a friend or two help us spread the word because we

01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:04.320
are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need

01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:06.320
more voices out there to put out there.

01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:07.760
So tell a friend or two about the show.

01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:11.840
A nice five star review on iTunes, Spotify, wherever it

01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:12.880
is you found this show.

01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:14.160
Those go an awful long way.

01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:15.200
We need more spot.

01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:17.680
Even if you don't listen in Spotify, if you have a Spotify

01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:19.760
account, please look up Orange Lounge Radio rate is five

01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:22.720
stars. Amazon has a big podcasting thing now, too.

01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:23.600
And we're in that as well.

01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:25.200
Rate, rate, rate, five stars.

01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:26.080
Really appreciate it.

01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:30.960
I saw, like, was it, I know there's another podcast I

01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:34.240
listened to that's more Minecraft related called the

01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:37.440
Wuthering effect, and they do like polls or like ask, have

01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:38.320
questions and comments.

01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:41.280
Like if there's actually like comment functionality in

01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:44.400
Spotify, which I didn't even know was a thing, I'll have

01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:45.120
to look into it.

01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:46.640
Yeah, I'm all for doing that.

01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:50.160
I want to be careful to not because it might be, it might

01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:52.560
be a Spotify exclusive show, and I don't want to make this

01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:57.760
show exclusive to anyone platform, but I'll look into it.

01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:00.320
I would rather they go to vognetwork.com to do the polls,

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:01.040
though, so we'll see.

01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:05.760
All right, that's it.

01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:08.320
Let's wrap it up and get out of here for the night.

01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:09.200
Let's get final thoughts.

01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:10.320
Loki, your final thought tonight.

01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:13.120
Keep working on Minecraft stuff.

01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:15.040
Do that.

01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:18.240
And me, I'm going to try to stream more Pokemon.

01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:21.040
I'm excited to play more of the game, get some more good

01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:24.800
stuff, start trading for version exclusives, breeding the

01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:29.840
dittos, getting three dittos deep on sprigatito clones and

01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:30.720
so forth.

01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:31.920
So that's it.

01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:33.360
Have a great week, everybody.

01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:35.360
We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:36.960
I hope you all have a wonderful night.

01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:37.360
Good night.

01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:02.720
Not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge

01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:06.880
Radio nor VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.
