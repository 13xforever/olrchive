00:00.000 --> 00:18.000
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.240
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk and then some.

00:23.240 --> 00:26.520
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

00:26.520 --> 00:30.520
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

00:30.520 --> 00:36.520
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

00:36.520 --> 00:40.520
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:40.520 --> 00:44.520
Yes, I will spank your child. If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

00:48.520 --> 00:51.520
Well, here's to my big opening.

00:51.520 --> 00:52.520
A sphincter says what?

00:52.520 --> 00:54.520
I'm super. Thanks for asking.

00:54.520 --> 00:57.520
Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.520
What am I doing here?

00:59.520 --> 01:01.520
No.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.520
Dodge this.

01:02.520 --> 01:05.520
Mm-hmm. This is a tasty burger.

01:05.520 --> 01:07.520
Look, you stupid bastard. You've got no arms left.

01:07.520 --> 01:09.520
Yes, I have. Look.

01:09.520 --> 01:10.520
There's a flesh wound.

01:10.520 --> 01:13.520
Searching for a boy in high school is useless.

01:13.520 --> 01:17.520
It's searching for meaning in a polyshore movie.

01:17.520 --> 01:22.520
Oh, yeah? Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

01:22.520 --> 01:23.520
Dark Sakura.

01:23.520 --> 01:30.040
Sakura, I had a sniff sky, but I'm playing it for the bartender. So suffer Loki. I hate you

01:30.560 --> 01:32.560

02:06.740 --> 02:10.740
Jamie's not here right now, so I don't know where she's at.

02:10.740 --> 02:13.740
She's probably stuck in traffic somewhere, and we'll be hearing about her.

02:13.740 --> 02:16.740
Fucking old people on the way over there. Don't bitch in the front. You're in there.

02:16.740 --> 02:19.740
She parked in my space, and I told her to fuck off.

02:19.740 --> 02:23.740
So, I don't know where she is. She'll be here soon, I'm sure.

02:23.740 --> 02:27.740
In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

02:27.740 --> 02:31.740

02:31.740 --> 02:35.740
Trainable. I'm a trainable.

02:35.740 --> 02:39.740

03:31.000 --> 03:34.100

03:34.100 --> 03:36.820

So take it easy now, I can't show you how

Just pick up a beat inside, this is where it'll take all to do it all

06:04.220 --> 06:08.220
You can't give up, you can't get in

06:08.220 --> 06:11.220
When things are looking right, the world is coming down

06:11.220 --> 06:16.220
Because you make the cut, it's the day to win

06:16.220 --> 06:19.220
And you can't even be honest

06:19.220 --> 06:22.220
You were your best, easy gone off

06:22.220 --> 06:25.720
Don't you agree with me tonight, forever, not tonight?

06:25.720 --> 06:30.220
So I'll let you rest, we'll never fall

06:30.220 --> 06:33.220
Believe me, you never will

06:33.220 --> 06:35.720
Ain't nobody holding a picture back

06:35.720 --> 06:37.720
I got it wrong, cause you don't believe this

06:43.720 --> 06:45.720
I can't breathe no more, you know you're back

06:45.720 --> 06:48.720
When it's the beginning, waiting to see

06:48.720 --> 06:50.720
What you feel like, trying to find a room

06:50.720 --> 06:53.220
This is the love you'll always be here for

06:53.220 --> 06:56.720
Even if you know, it's the love for you

06:56.720 --> 06:58.720
We're just waiting for you to get through

06:58.720 --> 07:01.220
So when you go and get through, take a roll

07:06.720 --> 07:09.720
What you want to do, so take it easy now

08:10.680 --> 08:14.680
Why don't you show me something about you?

08:44.680 --> 08:48.680
Orange Lounge Radio. We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

08:48.680 --> 08:54.680
It's server made to be fighting at number. It's server made to be fighting at number.

08:54.680 --> 09:01.680
Howdy everybody, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. Here we are at the start of episode number 63.

09:01.680 --> 09:03.680
Whoop-de-doo.

09:03.680 --> 09:11.680
What an exciting week. Not quite the as exciting of a week as last week when we had Max 2 was out and new and all that other fun stuff.

09:11.680 --> 09:17.320
stuff. Although, Jamie is here and she brought with her, she brought the U.S. versions of

09:17.320 --> 09:22.760
V-Rare 1 and V-Rare 2. That you have to get at Fry's, correct?

09:22.760 --> 09:28.120
V-Rare 1 you got at Toys R Us actually with DDR Max and V-Rare 2 you have to get at Fry's,

09:28.120 --> 09:30.160
which is pissing a lot of East Coast people off.

09:30.160 --> 09:31.960
Because there's no Fry's out there? Because there's no Fry's out there.

09:31.960 --> 09:37.120
Suck with them. Well, I know Fry's 1 runs a website at Outpost.com,

09:37.120 --> 09:40.560
right? That was the only place you were able to get.

09:40.560 --> 09:46.060
You remember when Dance Dance Revolution for the PC came out? You could only get it at Fry's, it was a Fry's exclusive.

09:46.060 --> 09:48.560
But you could order some Outpost.com.

09:48.560 --> 09:51.160
I know, but humor me for a second here.

09:51.160 --> 09:55.060
So theoretically, shouldn't you be able to get those samplers at Outpost.com?

09:55.060 --> 09:58.360
I don't know, and I really don't care, because I already have the...

09:58.360 --> 10:01.260
I already have that too, and I could just get the VR online somewhere.

10:01.260 --> 10:03.260
I would think so, but...

10:03.260 --> 10:09.360
Well I know, but for a collector, and if you're a hardcore collector on the East Coast, this is going to piss you off that you can't get it.

10:09.360 --> 10:10.260
Over there.

10:10.260 --> 10:12.260
and I am not a collector, sir.

10:40.260 --> 10:44.100
I hate the stinky old man at my apartment complex.

10:44.100 --> 10:47.260
Well I think now might be a good time to get into our favorite game we like to play here

10:47.260 --> 10:48.620
at Orange Lounge Radio.

10:48.620 --> 10:51.580
How was your day and how was your week?

10:51.580 --> 10:55.700
So I think, Jamie, it would be most appropriate if you would start us off tonight.

10:55.700 --> 11:02.580
Well, starting with the week, the week was pretty good, you know, nothing really horrible

11:02.580 --> 11:03.580
happened.

11:03.580 --> 11:09.020
Got to have somewhat of a date with Dan, which we hardly ever get to spend time together.

11:09.020 --> 11:12.020
It was pretty good.

11:12.020 --> 11:14.240
Last night was great.

11:14.240 --> 11:17.020
I drank how much last night?

11:17.020 --> 11:18.380
A lot.

11:18.380 --> 11:25.100
Not as much as I usually do when I go drinking, but it was pretty good and I was very happy

11:25.100 --> 11:28.220
and spent most of the evening with a pleasant buzz.

11:28.220 --> 11:31.820
What did we do?

11:31.820 --> 11:34.460
Oh yeah, it was Chub's birthday.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.740
Yes, Chub's birthday party was his birthday.

11:36.740 --> 11:44.660
And that was really lots of fun, and happy birthday to Chubbs, being 21 now.

11:44.660 --> 11:47.620
Played some Bump It Up while someone intoxicated.

11:47.620 --> 11:54.060
Played lots of that crappy wannabe pachinko machine, and I have this blue spotted dog

11:54.060 --> 11:59.460
and a cup that says Dave and Buster's on it.

11:59.460 --> 12:07.700
Today, though, I'm, you know, in bed sleeping because I was up till 5.30 in the morning

12:07.700 --> 12:14.500
and I hear, if you don't get up and help me clean this house, you're not going to go to

12:14.500 --> 12:16.500
your show.

12:16.500 --> 12:23.020
So I get up and go, excuse me, and then clean the house.

12:23.020 --> 12:32.020
So I spent practically all of my day cleaning the house, then had a nice shower, got ready.

12:32.020 --> 12:42.300
I stayed at home long enough to turn on the show and went to the grocery store and then

12:42.300 --> 12:47.860
I was in every bit of bad traffic I could possibly imagine, short of there being a wreck.

12:47.860 --> 12:51.340
Because, you know, I wouldn't be here right now had there been a wreck because I would

12:51.340 --> 12:58.220
still be behind all these people, stopping and staring at the rack. Wow. Oh my god, I

12:58.220 --> 13:07.220
see a bloody stump! That's an arm. Ooh, yay. You know, if you want to see bloody stumps,

13:07.220 --> 13:14.700
just go rent a horror movie or something. Rent faces a death. I was talking about if

13:14.700 --> 13:17.900
there had been an accident, people would be stopping and going, oh, can I see a bloody

13:17.900 --> 13:29.260
stumped so at any rate that's why I was late you know stupid people and and now

13:29.260 --> 13:33.820
I'm doing laundry oh yeah I had another thing happen during the week but it's

13:33.820 --> 13:41.060
really retarded I never mind I'm not gonna talk about that cuz I figured as

13:41.060 --> 13:50.620
I played some PSO, my game froze in the middle of playing PSO so I lost the two levels I

13:50.620 --> 13:55.440
gained and all of my items that weren't equipped including my meteor cudgel which pissed me

13:55.440 --> 14:01.260
off but I'm getting them all back and that's really about it.

14:01.260 --> 14:04.740
Buy stuff from my vendor in Ragnarok, thank you.

14:04.740 --> 14:09.740
All right, let's move on. Puppy, how was your day and how was your week?

14:09.740 --> 14:20.020
Let's see, today I'm kind of pissy because I've had too much chemistry work to do. I've

14:20.020 --> 14:27.500
spent all day writing up lab reports and writing up freaking chemistry things. I had to bring

14:27.500 --> 14:33.540
my chemistry book with me so I could work on it before the show started. And then I

14:33.540 --> 14:38.900
had a little adventure at lunch. I wanted to go get food before leaving to come to the

14:38.900 --> 14:44.900
show, so I go down the street to Carl's Jr.'s, I look inside, there's like fifteen people

14:44.900 --> 14:50.980
in line to order, and like one person working behind the counter. So I'm like, screw this.

14:50.980 --> 14:57.220
I go over to the subway nearby. They don't take ATM cards. I go down to the two grocery

14:57.220 --> 15:01.220
stores in the same plaza, and either of them have working ATMs. I drive halfway across

15:01.220 --> 15:07.700
to a liquor store that has an ATM, it's not working. I drive back downtown to go get food,

15:07.700 --> 15:13.900
and then when I finally get back with it, it's not the right thing. I ate it anyways

15:13.900 --> 15:19.460
because I was hungry and hadn't eaten anything in almost 24 hours. So yeah, that made me

15:19.460 --> 15:26.900
kind of pissy. And then the whole stupid driver thing, that's for everybody that drives,

15:26.900 --> 15:53.100
except for the stupid drivers themselves.

15:53.100 --> 15:55.340
Bradley, how was your day and how was your week?

15:55.340 --> 15:56.340
All right.

15:56.340 --> 16:00.240
Beginning of this week I went to a temp agency and then they sent me to an interview for

16:00.240 --> 16:02.800
data entry position the next day.

16:02.800 --> 16:11.100
I did okay on that, but of course as I go on I think of many different ways that I screwed

16:11.100 --> 16:12.100
it up.

16:12.100 --> 16:18.020
It was like my first real job interview, talking to an actual person in front of them.

16:18.020 --> 16:22.500
The only other job interview I've ever done was over the phone for an intern thing five

16:22.500 --> 16:32.140
years ago. Of course, I was supposedly supposed to find out at the end of Tuesday if he decided

16:32.140 --> 16:38.660
yes or no. I call in and the person in the agency is supposed to call me back, but she

16:38.660 --> 16:45.340
never does. I was waiting until the next morning and I call in and what did he decide? He's

16:45.340 --> 16:50.760
looking at more looking at the resumes and everything so we have to wait a bit

16:50.760 --> 16:54.940
longer and then so wait the Thursday Friday and he hasn't decided by Friday

16:54.940 --> 17:00.220
yet so I guess I find out next week sometime so I doubt it I'll get it

17:00.220 --> 17:03.520
because I didn't do all that great you know what though I've been I've been in

17:03.520 --> 17:06.940
a very similar position in job hunting where you're going to like 10 pages to

17:06.940 --> 17:11.220
10 base your staffing industry whatever it is and I swear to God those people

17:11.220 --> 17:15.540
are never really with it like they never are able to meet their deadlines or

17:15.540 --> 17:19.180
whatever you're just strung along like a stupid puppet and then finally just out

17:19.180 --> 17:24.140
of the blue one day it'll hit so we'll all cross our fingers for you yeah so

17:24.140 --> 17:30.660
well have to go look at stuff next week that's the future maybe try to fake my

17:30.660 --> 17:36.220
way to knowing medical terminology but since I know a little bit I may be able

18:06.220 --> 18:18.220
kostjamrh How was your day and week?

18:36.220 --> 18:43.220
it

18:44.440 --> 18:46.720
we have this journal and you're supposed to write

18:46.720 --> 18:49.700
beginning and endings just anything about it

18:49.700 --> 18:51.380
so my topic now is

18:51.380 --> 18:55.140
beginning of work with fifty seven and the end of my life

18:55.140 --> 18:56.860
but but but

18:56.860 --> 18:59.380
which is how bad it is interesting

18:59.380 --> 19:04.980
i've written on my friends uh... legal pad kill me now please just kill me now

19:04.980 --> 19:08.580
during English class

19:08.580 --> 19:10.520
and other than that

19:10.520 --> 19:13.920
cutting back on initial D slowly

19:13.920 --> 19:17.480
good for you

19:17.480 --> 19:18.720
I'm just messing with you

19:18.720 --> 19:20.920
uh... let's see

19:20.920 --> 19:23.120
kind of studying

19:23.120 --> 19:25.280
extra emphasis on kind of

19:25.280 --> 19:27.320
going out meeting lots of people

19:27.320 --> 19:29.660
other than that's been a pretty okay week

19:29.660 --> 19:33.000
except my mom's always over emotional every time she comes here

19:33.000 --> 19:34.040
It's getting kind of irritating.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.320
It's like, gee, mom, I'm not going

19:36.320 --> 19:38.480
to die while I'm in Davis, OK?

19:38.480 --> 19:40.600
But I miss my baby.

19:40.600 --> 19:41.800
You know, it's kind of funny.

19:41.800 --> 19:44.760
I actually saw she didn't like having me around the house.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.680
And then all of a sudden, they move away.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.200
Now she's like, oh, my god.

19:48.200 --> 19:50.500
They can't wait to get rid of you until they do,

19:50.500 --> 19:51.880
and then they miss you like hell.

19:51.880 --> 19:52.800
Yep.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.280
So yeah, it's been a pretty good week.

19:54.280 --> 20:05.920
I'm eating these blue chips so I'm having a hard time talking right now.

20:05.920 --> 20:10.080
Next we'll go to Loki and see how his day and his week was but first I want to say hello

20:10.080 --> 20:12.760
to some new chatters we have in our chat room tonight because we have a lot of new people

20:12.760 --> 20:13.760
in the chat room tonight.

20:13.760 --> 20:14.760
Are they listening?

20:14.760 --> 20:15.760
Are they listening?

20:15.760 --> 20:19.440
They better be listening because we know.

20:19.440 --> 20:23.880
We know and we will find out and you will pay if you're not.

20:23.880 --> 20:30.880
click on orange lounge and click on chat if you want to join in, just like these new people

20:31.880 --> 20:38.880
I don't recognize have been here before. Greg is Masa, hello. Zodiac Knight, hello.

20:38.880 --> 20:45.880
Sen, hello. And XT Senai. Oh, they're the same person. Well, she got said hello to twice.

20:45.880 --> 20:51.240
the same person well she got said hello to twice what a lucky lucky girl hello to everybody

20:52.840 --> 20:58.280
okay Loki how was your day how was your week i didn't do anything today except they started

20:58.280 --> 21:06.360
wiring my second pads um and those are almost done probably done this week and i was playing

21:06.360 --> 21:12.840
on the one that is done and it was pretty cool until the ground wire fell off then that didn't

21:12.840 --> 21:18.400
work too well so I had to re-solder that and I didn't do that much I worked a

21:18.400 --> 21:24.840
little bit last night up until about 5 in the morning and did some stuff

21:24.840 --> 21:28.680
because I rebooted my computer you dumbass and it automatically kicks on

21:28.680 --> 21:37.520
right away anyways and then that's about it people were gone from my work so I

21:37.520 --> 21:45.520
So I had it pretty easy the last two days. I just ate sandwiches and read the internet.

21:45.520 --> 21:47.520
Cool deal.

21:47.520 --> 21:52.520
Yeah. Oh, and downloaded more Zim. New Zim.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.520
Because you're the biggest pirate ever. Arr, arr.

21:55.520 --> 22:00.520
We watched a cool video today that I got off the internet.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.520
It's about teaching sex.

22:02.520 --> 22:05.520
We'll get into it in the after birth.

22:05.520 --> 22:09.700
we're going to make Jamie watch the journey afterwards.

22:09.700 --> 22:13.000
You have to go home right after the show?

22:13.000 --> 22:16.320
You can't sleep for a little bit?

22:16.320 --> 22:17.840
But I want to tell!

22:17.840 --> 22:21.960
Fine, tell. It's about teaching sex ed the retards.

22:21.960 --> 22:27.520
It's an instructional video.

22:27.520 --> 22:30.040
They were called trainers.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.600
Trainables!

22:31.600 --> 22:34.040
As you can actually think, diapers, trainables.

22:34.040 --> 22:36.280
OK.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.440
Anyway, we'll get into that in the afterbirth, which

22:38.440 --> 22:41.560
is after the credits of the program.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.600
God, our charem is such a bunch of moody bitches, I swear.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.380
All the people I didn't say hi to,

22:46.380 --> 22:48.120
like all of our regulars who've been here

22:48.120 --> 22:50.280
weeks and weeks before, they get their FUs read every week

22:50.280 --> 22:50.960
and everything.

22:50.960 --> 22:53.120
Now they're all, why didn't you say hi to me?

22:53.120 --> 22:54.760
Why didn't you say hi to me cry face?

22:54.760 --> 22:57.920
Because you don't matter.

22:57.920 --> 23:00.400
I'm trying to extend a warm welcome to the new people.

23:00.400 --> 23:04.240
The old people should always already feel appreciated.

23:04.240 --> 23:04.880
We love Orange.

23:04.880 --> 23:09.160
I give a general shout out hello to the Orange Lounge chat

23:09.160 --> 23:11.200
in general.

23:11.200 --> 23:15.560
And I gave Jamie a dollar yesterday.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.440
And he got spent a liquor.

23:18.440 --> 23:21.560
Bitch, I bought you a drink.

23:21.560 --> 23:24.320
You drink half of it.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.600
That's neither here nor there.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.000
So then without further ado, I'll

23:27.000 --> 23:28.280
talk about my week and my day.

23:28.280 --> 23:29.800
Because I actually have video game stories

23:29.800 --> 23:42.080
to talk about. This week I actually went out and played DDR not once, not twice, but three

23:42.080 --> 23:47.480
times. And Rob can count. Scary isn't it? And you know what's weird? I think this is

23:47.480 --> 23:51.200
actually working because my pants are like about ready to fall off. It's like they're

23:51.200 --> 23:56.800
down to here. I'm losing weight. This is so exciting. My ass is getting smaller with all

23:56.800 --> 24:03.080
the studio I've been playing I'm so happy but anyway well I know but it's

24:03.080 --> 24:07.960
it's it's it's not just that but it's that I've been playing it more in the

24:07.960 --> 24:13.400
past month and I've been you know eating less crap I still eat crap but I'm

24:13.400 --> 24:18.120
eating less crap and all that stuff

24:19.200 --> 24:24.480
and now Iron Chef VHG is cooking me dinner I wonder what I need to bring in

25:54.480 --> 26:01.480
I think Do It Right, the harmonized two step, thank you, I'm really close on that one too.

26:01.480 --> 26:09.880
Oh, and 1998, anyway, so there's a lot of these sevens I'm really close on, but I haven't

26:09.880 --> 26:11.200
done it yet.

26:11.200 --> 26:14.840
I'm so close!

26:14.840 --> 26:19.060
So there's been that, and Friday I went out there too, but I just played a couple games

26:19.060 --> 26:22.840
because I was going to meet somebody more than anything on Friday.

26:22.840 --> 26:29.740
And then, uh, yesterday was Chub's birthday party and I went with Dark Sakura to San Jose

26:29.740 --> 26:31.440
and we went to Milpitas Golf Land.

26:31.440 --> 26:34.840
I got to play some Horsey Crack, cause I haven't played in about three months, so I started

26:34.840 --> 26:37.080
a new horse, and her name is Sana.

26:37.080 --> 26:38.720
Oh, I retired Happy Bunny.

26:38.720 --> 26:40.820
Yes, you retired Happy Bunny.

26:40.820 --> 26:42.560
And bred a Kiriyamaoka.

26:42.560 --> 26:47.040
Wow, you made a, you made a Kiriyamaoka breed, huh?

26:47.040 --> 26:51.200
No, my horse, and who, who was the mommy horse?

26:51.200 --> 26:54.840
One of Mel's horses, and they birthed a kiriyama oka.

26:54.840 --> 26:56.720
Did you get any other rare horses?

26:56.720 --> 26:57.940
I just have my three.

26:57.940 --> 27:04.160
I saw a horsey on the top list, like the number one horse on the list was like a panda, but

27:04.160 --> 27:05.160
it was brown.

27:05.160 --> 27:06.160
Yeah, it was a chocolate panda.

27:06.160 --> 27:07.160
That was neat.

27:07.160 --> 27:08.160
How exciting.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.160
To go with the chocolate martinis.

27:10.160 --> 27:14.040
Yes, to go with the chocolate martinis.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.480
Then what else was I thinking?

27:15.480 --> 27:19.260
Oh, also the other cool thing about Derby Owners Club, I've never seen, for some reason

27:19.260 --> 27:22.280
whenever I've been to play I always get like the outdoorsy tracks I've never

27:22.280 --> 27:25.980
seen that track that's Sega and it's like nighttime and it has Sonic the

27:25.980 --> 27:32.080
Hedgehog on it and stuff it's cute it's cute I like it I saw the coolest thing

27:32.080 --> 27:38.160
though on horsey crack what a five-horse photo finish oh yeah I remember seeing

27:38.160 --> 27:42.960
that the five-horse photo finish it's crazy five horses all finished with the

27:42.960 --> 27:46.880
same seconds and like what thousandth second they all finished five of them it

28:16.880 --> 28:20.260
stupid or whatever, but I never knew this before. There's little lights above all the

28:20.260 --> 28:23.460
machines and if you're sitting in a machine and you're playing, and it can be anything.

28:23.460 --> 28:26.280
Like if you're playing like some video game, you're playing like Hydro Thunder or something,

28:26.280 --> 28:29.440
you hit the little switch and somebody will come by, little light lights up above the

28:29.440 --> 28:33.000
machine, somebody comes by and says, oh can I get you a drink? And you go yeah, I want

28:33.000 --> 28:37.460
a Midori Sour or something. And then they'll go get it and bring it to you. It's so cool.

28:37.460 --> 28:41.540
Never though, try to pay somebody for a drink while you're in the middle of a game of Hydro

28:41.540 --> 28:46.160
Thunder. Yeah, it was hard because I was playing... I got this place though. I was playing a game

29:16.160 --> 29:19.720
ready to go, and when she came, I just used one hand to keep playing the game, the other

29:19.720 --> 29:26.880
hand I handed her money and grabbed my drink. And, DarkSacker and I saw the coolest game

29:26.880 --> 29:32.560
ever. That Rapid Racer. The Rapid Racer. That game is awesome. Oh, God. I know, it's, Loki

29:32.560 --> 29:37.260
sent it somewhere else. Yeah, it's like when, they had that one, and it's also in the same

29:37.260 --> 29:42.000
family of Namco games as, um, Prop Cycle. The Prop Cycle. What is, uh, Kayaking? It

29:42.000 --> 29:45.960
was a kayaking game. Is that what you call it? Well, more like Inflatable Raps. Inflatable

29:45.960 --> 29:52.960
River Rafting

30:15.960 --> 30:20.100
I have my one martini and then we play the pump it up premiere 3 which I'd

30:20.100 --> 30:23.800
never seen before but they had premiere 3 of pump it up there all the old crap

30:23.800 --> 30:30.800
there's only one licensed recognizable song in the whole game and it's pink get

30:30.800 --> 30:36.040
the party started coming up so you bet but it's really crazy because there's

30:36.040 --> 30:39.800
parts it if you play it on crazy mode like they ain't fucking with you it

30:39.800 --> 30:43.160
really is crazy you will be jumping around and like you'll have this freeze

30:43.160 --> 30:47.120
that are the top two arrows because you know pump it up is five it's four

30:47.120 --> 30:50.640
corners in the center so it's like the top two arrows and then you have to hit

30:50.640 --> 30:53.640
the middle one with your hand and then the back two with your hand as well and

30:53.640 --> 30:58.560
this is all in the span of about like one second it's crazy it's like a note a

30:58.560 --> 31:03.000
12 footer it's it's sick so we were watching Chubbs and people try to do

31:03.000 --> 31:08.040
that and it was really funny because Chubbs was really drunk and yes and he

31:08.040 --> 31:11.160
was like doing it on the ground and stuff like she was like hand slapping

31:41.160 --> 31:47.000
the biggest food court I've ever seen in my life, oh my God. They had like Chinese, Japanese,

31:47.000 --> 31:59.160
Indian, McDonald's, steak. Yeah, it was a rip-off, but it was huge. It's so big. So

31:59.160 --> 32:04.640
yeah, we did all that and then we got home last night at about 2 a.m. and then Loki and

32:04.640 --> 32:12.200
are watching music videos until late. Which one am I talking about later? I don't know.

32:12.200 --> 32:19.040
So, I guess we'll take a break? Unless anybody else has something they want to say?

32:19.040 --> 32:32.880
Okay, let's do that. Let's play something on VR2. There's nothing new that hasn't been

32:32.880 --> 32:37.080
in Japan already, but it's new to the US. There's just some interesting things on it,

33:07.080 --> 33:15.520
You know what, looking at this, I'm not sure what to, because some of these are really

33:15.520 --> 33:16.520
long.

33:16.520 --> 33:18.640
Yeah, so I'll just play some of the game edits.

33:18.640 --> 33:22.560
The Funk Disco Extended mix of High Lady.

33:22.560 --> 33:23.560
Okay.

33:23.560 --> 33:24.560
We'll do that.

33:24.560 --> 33:25.560
We'll play...

33:25.560 --> 33:26.560
That's a long one.

33:26.560 --> 33:28.400
It's kind of long, so this will be the only song we play this break.

33:28.400 --> 33:32.480
When we come back, we will talk about other stuff.

33:32.480 --> 33:34.280
We'll talk about some Imani news going on.

33:34.280 --> 33:41.280
Loki will give us a sim update and later tonight, by the way, I don't want to ruin it if it's your cage match pick.

33:41.280 --> 33:46.280
Oh no, you're picking, you told me you were doing the paranoia thing, right? Tonight?

33:46.280 --> 33:49.280
So we have a new Loki remix to debut tonight, yes?

33:49.280 --> 33:50.280
Yes.

33:50.280 --> 33:53.280
So we have a new Loki remix to debut a little later on in the program.

33:53.280 --> 34:00.280
So, enjoy this from the DDR Max II V-Rare. This is Kind Lady, the funky disco extended mix, and we'll be back.

34:53.280 --> 34:58.280
Logicity, Logicity, Logicity, Logicity, Logicity

34:58.280 --> 35:02.280
He knew he had a charge and that's all it is

35:02.280 --> 35:05.280
He worked him up to try again

35:05.280 --> 35:07.280
But Grinchy cut it back

35:07.280 --> 35:09.280
Ain't no man who's like the man

35:09.280 --> 35:12.280
He knew he had a charge and that's all it is

35:12.280 --> 35:16.280
I wouldn't know if he was in the mood for talking

35:16.280 --> 35:19.280
So he began to play the game

35:19.280 --> 35:23.280
Before he knew it, he had told her how much he'd been hurting

35:23.280 --> 35:26.280
Though he was holding, she was not the same

35:26.280 --> 35:28.280
Who would you be?

35:28.280 --> 35:31.280
I'm afraid that I'm thinking after all of these crimes

35:31.280 --> 35:33.280
Don't you be true love

35:33.280 --> 35:37.280
She said, boy, you don't have to love me no more

35:37.280 --> 35:40.280
I'll give the love you need to your father in love

35:40.280 --> 35:42.280
Guaranteed, I'd like to rest forever

35:42.280 --> 35:46.280
Finally, you deserve to see so good I am

35:46.280 --> 35:51.280
I am but your own when you wake up late thinking it's just me

35:51.280 --> 35:55.280
So fuck me boy, you know you can count on me, believe me

35:55.280 --> 35:58.280
Baby, I'm just a lady, you know what you've found in me

35:58.280 --> 36:02.280
You're the lady, the kind of lady that can give you what you need

36:02.280 --> 36:05.280
Baby, I'm just a lady, that can never leave you lonely

36:05.280 --> 36:07.280
The end was made up in the ladies

36:07.280 --> 36:09.280
That's why the baby's down in your back

36:37.280 --> 36:39.280
Oh

37:07.280 --> 37:09.280
Oh

40:36.280 --> 40:40.280
And after all of this time, could this dream be left?

40:40.280 --> 40:44.280
She said, boy, you don't have to love me no more

40:44.280 --> 40:48.280
I'll give the love you need till you holler and I'll guarantee

40:48.280 --> 40:50.280
I'll cry forever

40:50.280 --> 40:54.280
Hey, lady, you've been loved by people that I am but you

40:54.280 --> 40:58.280
And when you wake up, baby, then it's a dream

40:58.280 --> 41:02.280
So just before you know, you can count on me, believe me

41:02.280 --> 41:05.280
Up in the lady, you know what she's got in me

41:05.280 --> 41:08.280
Is a lady, kinda lady, that can give you what you need

41:08.280 --> 41:11.280
I'm a lady, got my kind lady, that can help you

41:11.280 --> 41:13.280
Leave you lonely, I'm just a lady

41:13.280 --> 41:15.280
Up in the lady, finally we've got you

41:15.280 --> 41:17.280
Up in the lady

41:17.280 --> 41:41.720
Welcome back.

41:41.720 --> 41:46.520
We hope you enjoyed that kind lady funk disco extended mix, all seven minutes of it, from

41:46.520 --> 41:52.680
the USA V-rare 2 soundtrack and what's interesting about these soundtracks is that you know let

41:52.680 --> 41:56.040
me just describe to you for those of you that didn't bother to visit our webcam when I had

41:56.040 --> 42:00.940
them up earlier on the front of these they say limited edition music sampler then you

42:00.940 --> 42:04.280
look on the back and they're very similar in the way they look they have a screenshot

42:04.280 --> 42:08.560
from the game and they have the track listing and what's funny is it really shows the difference

42:08.560 --> 42:15.480
between Max and Max 2 here because with DDR Max it says Dance Dance Revolution game features

42:15.480 --> 42:21.560
over 70 songs and 100 plus minutes of authentic dance music. And then DDR Max 2 says the DDR

42:21.560 --> 42:27.980
Max 2 Dance Dance Revolution game features over 65 songs and 100 minutes, exactly, of

42:27.980 --> 42:29.980
authentic dance music.

42:29.980 --> 42:51.860
You know what, there's a big rule that I try to remember, it's called never think while

42:51.860 --> 42:55.060
you eat.

42:55.060 --> 42:58.540
We'll just take a picture of it and put it in front of you while you're eating dinner.

42:58.540 --> 43:05.020
will remind you of your ew. It'll look better when it's cooked, I know

43:05.020 --> 43:11.700
it will. Then when you look on the side, it says in really, really tiny print, warning

43:11.700 --> 43:16.820
all rights reserved, unauthorized duplication is a violation of applicable laws, printed

43:16.820 --> 43:22.900
in the USA, V-Rare Soundtrack USA, and in the next it says V-Rare Soundtrack 2. So it's

43:22.900 --> 43:26.820
kind of like, it's in really, really tiny print, but it's kind of a nod to the Japanese

43:26.820 --> 43:34.020
V rare ones very very very rare it's very rare if it were meat it would still

43:34.020 --> 43:41.340
be mooing actually for the record max 2 has 69 songs in it what a nice number

43:41.340 --> 43:52.860
not quite 70 but 69 and I think max 1 had like 71 so yay

43:52.860 --> 43:58.860
What else can I tell you about what's going on? What's going on in Bahmani News this week?

43:58.860 --> 44:01.860
Anybody hear any interesting things? Yes, Loki?

44:01.860 --> 44:05.860
I know some things, and if you don't mention them, I will.

44:05.860 --> 44:07.860
Yes, Loki?

44:07.860 --> 44:11.860
Okay. A bunch of shit's gone down this week.

44:11.860 --> 44:16.860
Starting with, first off, more details about DDR Extreme.

44:16.860 --> 44:20.860
It being that it's very similar to Max 2.

44:20.860 --> 44:27.860
Ooh, surprise. Surprise?

44:29.180 --> 44:30.300
Let's see.

44:30.300 --> 44:33.240
There's going to be dancing characters. Ooh, surprise.

44:33.240 --> 44:35.800
I know everyone's surprised.

44:35.800 --> 44:39.820
I think we announced last week a stupid barber was going to be in there.

44:39.820 --> 44:42.860
That type of shit.

44:42.860 --> 44:43.940
I'm trying to think.

44:43.940 --> 44:47.020
What else?

44:47.020 --> 44:51.140
nothing really else uh... as far as you know do we know if the other songs are

44:51.140 --> 44:53.660
going to be in it confirm yeah we probably did that we

44:53.660 --> 44:55.260
uh... probably

44:55.260 --> 44:57.660
that's no big deal though uh...

44:57.660 --> 45:00.660
so they are not too much going on with DDRxtreme, they're not going to release too much more

45:00.660 --> 45:04.860
infomeration because uh... obviously it's coming out in a couple weeks so you know

45:04.860 --> 45:08.420
i don't honestly think there's going to be too much more unlocked in that game

45:08.420 --> 45:11.580
than what they have, it'll probably be a stupid barber and guess what

45:11.580 --> 45:16.200
uh... i found out today that forever sunshine is going to be forever ours in

45:16.200 --> 45:22.960
the US, yes, that piece of shit, Forever Sunshine, is going to be pretty much replacing Let Them

45:22.960 --> 45:28.040
Move in the US as the piece of shit track that they get to put on every single release.

45:28.040 --> 45:32.840
Now wait a minute, last week we did have that vote and Let Them Move is still considered

45:32.840 --> 45:34.960
the worst of the two songs.

45:34.960 --> 45:41.840
Yeah, okay, so basically what you're saying is instead of Carrot Top, I have, I don't

45:41.840 --> 45:52.840
No, I have that. They're both bad, but it'll still wear on you.

45:52.840 --> 45:57.520
But anyways, enough with DDR Extreme, nothing going on there. The big news was in the Dance

45:57.520 --> 46:00.600
Dance Revolution party collection, which they announced the new tracks.

46:00.600 --> 46:04.320
And this is what's coming out after Extreme, and there's more news coming out on this mix

46:04.320 --> 46:05.920
than there is on the other one.

46:05.920 --> 46:10.600
First off, let's start with the new exclusive songs. Well, some of them exclusive, but anyways,

46:10.600 --> 46:14.920
We have Freedom, the new Before You track, which no one gets a rat's ass about, Wanna

46:14.920 --> 46:20.560
Be by the Spice Girls, which is also going to be in Dancing Stage with Peter, Try to

46:20.560 --> 46:26.980
Love You, which was also in Max 2 USA, Stars, which was in pop and music, Stars in second

46:26.980 --> 46:28.920
Naoki style, whatever that means.

46:28.920 --> 46:39.800
I need you, the Inside Outdoor Mix, which is a remix of I Need You from Max 2 USA, and

46:39.800 --> 46:44.800
And then a new Paranoia remix called Paranoia Respect by 0.3K

46:44.800 --> 46:46.800
Just What the World Needs, another Paranoia remix

46:46.800 --> 46:49.800
Which is probably going to be a 300 BPM Paranoia

46:49.800 --> 46:54.800
And they announced a few more licensed tracks in here

46:54.800 --> 46:59.800
Unfortunately I didn't know which ones were new than what we had last time

46:59.800 --> 47:04.800
One of the ones I remember is Music, which is from 4th Mix

47:04.800 --> 47:06.800
Oh, I love that song!

47:06.800 --> 47:30.800
XSE from 5th Mix of course, Overblast was another one, it looks like it's a pretty decent collection of like songs in there, Moonlight Shadow, Missing Heart was pretty good, plus this game has selectable characters and you earn the characters as you go along, and that's another thing about DDRXtreme is you earn the characters as you go along, not all at one time unlocked like in Max2USA

47:30.800 --> 47:34.800
And the selection screen for the characters is actually pretty cool.

47:34.800 --> 47:39.800
They had a video that was on IGN that people grabbed shots from that were pretty cool.

47:39.800 --> 47:40.800
You know what it reminded me of?

47:40.800 --> 47:41.800
That character selection screen?

47:41.800 --> 47:44.800
Have you guys ever played like one of those bootleg Nintendo carts?

47:44.800 --> 47:46.800
It's like Mortal Kombat with 64 characters.

47:46.800 --> 47:50.800
And they have all these little tiny pictures just all lined up in a big table.

47:50.800 --> 47:52.800
That's what it reminded me of.

47:52.800 --> 47:53.800
The character selection screen.

47:53.800 --> 47:56.800
Because there's so many characters in this party collection.

47:56.800 --> 48:07.240
So that's pretty much all that's going on there. Obviously it's going to be a re-skinned

48:07.240 --> 48:11.620
Extreme engine. Can I bitch for a minute about something?

48:11.620 --> 48:14.120
Yeah. I want to know why in the hell we're only

48:14.120 --> 48:18.780
getting one new dance media license on this whole thing. That license being Wannabe by

48:18.780 --> 48:23.360
the Spice Girls without the obvious that it was on the Euromix, so we're getting it

48:23.360 --> 48:26.980
too, I mean, because, you know, there's a hundred songs I could bring over from one

48:26.980 --> 48:32.820
of the USAs or Euromixes just because we got it. Wannabe by the Spice Girls was on, I believe

48:32.820 --> 48:39.240
it was Zip Mania Best, it was on one of the Dance Mania albums, so... Dance Mania Diamonds,

48:39.240 --> 48:44.820
the puppy, thank you. Easy, easy. Why waste any more effort on a compilation? But why

48:44.820 --> 48:50.380
just one? There's so many... Because you'll buy it just the same! No, I won't! Not because

48:50.380 --> 48:54.620
of that song. I mean, the Spice Girls are so five years ago. If this was five years

48:54.620 --> 48:57.940
ago, fuck yeah, I would have eaten that shit up. But this is five years later and everybody

48:57.940 --> 49:01.300
knows the Spice Girls are lame. But Japan isn't exactly on top of modern culture in

49:01.300 --> 49:05.300
the U.S. I understand that. For them, the Spice Girls are like, whoa, that's so cutting

49:05.300 --> 49:12.300
edge. I understand that, but why just one? I would rather they do none. If you looked

49:13.700 --> 49:18.940
at Dance Mania, or if you looked at DDR best hits, there was nothing new about it. It was

49:18.940 --> 49:25.020
just clear-cut, best tracks. You know, why give us these new tracks when they fucking

49:25.020 --> 49:26.020
suck?

49:26.020 --> 49:27.020
I don't know.

49:27.020 --> 49:30.080
Well, I don't know about these Konami originals. They may be good. When I talk about Dance

49:30.080 --> 49:33.240
Mania licenses, either you're going to take the effort to give us a lot of new Dance Mania

49:33.240 --> 49:38.220
stuff, which would be nice and very well appreciated, trust me, and prove that DDR is not dead yet,

49:38.220 --> 49:44.360
or you can give us crap. And that's what we're getting, is crap.

49:44.360 --> 49:49.400
Now, aside from home versions, there was a little bit of arcade news this week. First

49:49.400 --> 49:56.440
being DDR Extreme. If everyone remembers back to when they were first released to DDR Extreme,

49:56.440 --> 50:01.360
it was beta testing and all that stuff, how there were some onis for some of the older

50:01.360 --> 50:05.800
songs, just kind of like Lil' Bitch had some onis and stuff. But there was one step chart

50:05.800 --> 50:10.360
that was going around forever that people were like, I can't find this in the game,

50:10.360 --> 50:14.760
that's just got to be fake. You know, it was the Damderium Oni steps. Well, come to find

50:14.760 --> 50:18.400
out, they were actually going to be in there, but they just cut them out at the last minute.

50:18.400 --> 50:23.840
But thanks to the wonderful programming at Konami of Japan and their, you know, very

50:23.840 --> 50:29.000
buggy DDR Extreme, you can, you too can play these wonderful step charts that never made

50:29.000 --> 50:32.580
it in. And don't tell me Extreme does not feel rushed to any of you, because Extreme

50:32.580 --> 50:36.840
is the most buggy of any DDR game they've released yet. 1998 just froze on me Thursday.

50:36.840 --> 50:41.640
I played it for a song and it fucking freezes on me, but the neat thing is the arrow scroll

50:41.640 --> 50:45.640
by really fast to catch up and you can still hit them if you're fast enough. It's kind

50:45.640 --> 50:49.920
of challenging, but it also pisses you off. But anyways, what you do is you do the ONI

50:49.920 --> 50:54.320
trick. For those who are not familiar with the ONI trick, you have to go to an ONI selection

50:54.320 --> 51:00.480
screen or non-sub selection screen and you kind of switch back and forth until you switch,

51:00.480 --> 51:04.440
I believe it's just above where you're looking for. So say, for instance, you want to play

51:04.440 --> 51:08.920
Damdarium with the ONI steps. You pick a song, say, and what they've been doing is like the

51:08.920 --> 51:14.880
player's best, so say Damdarium is like number six in player's best. So what you need is

51:14.880 --> 51:20.560
you need to get an ONI, a song with just ONI steps, so basically one ONI remixes in number

51:20.560 --> 51:24.480
two because, you know, they're gonna match up. So what you're gonna do is you put it

51:24.480 --> 51:28.840
in there and you switch real fast, and then when Damdarium comes up, it's gonna have ONI

51:28.840 --> 51:32.960
steps on it because you switched it really fast and DDR Extreme is just really cool.

51:32.960 --> 51:35.360
to kind of reiterate that point for those that might not be getting it.

51:35.360 --> 51:39.960
When, if you ever notice when you're switching around in the difficulties,

51:39.960 --> 51:44.660
for just a minute when you're spinning that wheel on the ONI courses,

51:44.660 --> 51:48.260
if you're on something, let's say you're on an ONI course that has all heavy songs,

51:48.260 --> 51:51.260
for just like a split second, when you switch over to the one beneath it,

51:51.260 --> 51:53.060
there might be a bunch of trick songs.

51:53.060 --> 51:56.060
For like a split second, those trick songs will be listed in green.

51:56.060 --> 51:58.960
Like it does that thing where it's collapsed and then it expands,

51:58.960 --> 52:02.960
Well, like, right as it expands, it'll still be in that green color before it switches.

52:02.960 --> 52:04.960
And that's the trick they're exploiting here.

52:04.960 --> 52:10.960
Yes, um, the new Oni steps, they've got Damndarium, uh, singles and doubles, which are okay.

52:10.960 --> 52:15.960
Um, they've got one for, um, what was it, Love Love Shine, that's new single Oni.

52:15.960 --> 52:20.960
And then they have one that's just retarded for, um, uh, Blue Impulse.

52:20.960 --> 52:22.960
Uh, or Alley Shadow.

52:22.960 --> 52:27.960
Yeah, it's, all it is is completely blank and one freeze error at the very end.

52:27.960 --> 52:33.200
It looks like one of my edits that I did to kick the can years ago called Big Cans.

52:33.200 --> 52:37.240
It's one arrow at the end of the whole thing.

52:37.240 --> 52:43.920
That's the one where, was it Rick and Timmy Nepal got off the machine and ran circles

52:43.920 --> 52:47.560
around Golf Land and then came back and hit the last step.

52:47.560 --> 52:51.000
Yes, that was my edit to Big Cans, which I never did finish.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.920
Big Cans will always be only half the song.

52:52.920 --> 52:54.060
I never finished it.

52:54.060 --> 52:55.060
It's gone.

52:55.060 --> 52:57.360
I think I deleted it.

52:57.360 --> 53:01.180
Do you really? I found one of my old missing memory cards

53:01.180 --> 53:05.740
that has my edits on it. What the hell is that noise?

53:05.740 --> 53:09.840
Now, wait, real fast. I just want to say, this week as well, if you are a local player,

53:09.840 --> 53:12.980
and I know Orange Land Radio is an international show, we have people listening to Japan and

53:12.980 --> 53:16.860
everywhere, but if you happen to be in Orange Land headquarters in Sacramento, at Roseville

53:16.860 --> 53:21.700
Golf Land, you can now play, Loki and my edits are in the machine at Golf Land.

53:21.700 --> 53:23.820
Some of them. I'm working on them.

53:23.820 --> 53:29.740
I'm getting some more. I'm making a new Legend of Max edit.

53:29.740 --> 53:34.780
A new thing I was going to mention also, the last of the news, is there was a nice little

53:34.780 --> 53:40.980
bootleg upgrade on eBay recently. It was Dance Dance Revolution Megamix, which included all

53:40.980 --> 53:47.820
the songs from 4th, 5th, and Extreme. A nice little bootleg package there, which is actually

53:47.820 --> 53:49.900
still up for auction right now.

53:49.900 --> 53:54.480
seller ended the listing early because of the error in the listing

53:54.480 --> 53:56.320
the item has been relisted

53:56.320 --> 54:02.320
i don't see what they say

54:08.880 --> 54:10.040
what are you reading here

54:10.040 --> 54:11.880
i'm just reading the auction

54:11.880 --> 54:13.240
this auction is for

54:13.240 --> 54:17.600
for the ninth dance dance revolution upgrade kit named megamix this upgrade

54:17.600 --> 54:19.880
includes all the songs of eighth

54:19.880 --> 54:26.760
5th mix and 4th mix games. The kit includes marquee which looks like a piece of shit.

54:26.760 --> 54:30.200
Upgrade instructions and software and hardware components to upgrade your 3rd mix and higher

54:30.200 --> 54:35.300
DDR2 player machine. Like who will link this eBay auction in the

54:35.300 --> 54:39.720
chatroom for all of you. Yes, it is just a piece of shit.

54:39.720 --> 54:43.480
Now I noticed that you had posted about this over on Aaron in Japan and they were all kind

54:43.480 --> 54:46.280
of going, obviously this isn't an official Konami release.

54:46.280 --> 54:51.600
I did not post it in Japan. They had already posted it in there. I saw it actually earlier

54:51.600 --> 54:52.600
in the week.

54:52.600 --> 54:53.600
Oh, sorry.

54:53.600 --> 55:00.080
Sorry, sorry. Then people started noticing it. But, you know, duh, obviously it's a bootleg.

55:00.080 --> 55:05.840
But the most curious thing about this is whether it legitimately is 8th, 5th, and 4th or not.

55:05.840 --> 55:06.840
No, it...

55:06.840 --> 55:12.840
I am knocking my shit over. What are you doing? What are you doing? Those are my post-its.

55:12.840 --> 55:13.840
No.

55:13.840 --> 55:15.840
What the hell?

55:15.840 --> 55:19.840
They have got information on them. It's important information.

55:19.840 --> 55:23.840
Gosh. Sorry.

55:23.840 --> 55:27.840
I like being overdramatic.

55:27.840 --> 55:31.840
No, but anyways, no, it's a legit hack in the game, so

55:31.840 --> 55:35.840
it does have all the songs that it claims it has, it's just that no one spent time

55:35.840 --> 55:39.840
to create a marquee. I don't believe that the guy is telling you

55:39.840 --> 55:43.840
that all the songs are in there, but I will not believe it until I see a video of it. Period.

55:43.840 --> 55:52.480
Why? Because it doesn't make sense. How do all those songs fit on a CD? There's got to

55:52.480 --> 55:57.220
be some kind of switch or something. They're doing something, either it's fake or there's

55:57.220 --> 56:04.720
something really low tech about it. Easy! Easy, you take out the videos. That's okay,

56:04.720 --> 56:08.300
so that's a possibility, but that's just what I want to know. I want to know more about

56:08.300 --> 56:31.980
kostjamrh Is it really only a dollar right now? Maybe

56:31.980 --> 56:50.980
p0k3smot42o I would laugh at whoever was stupid enough to bid on that

57:01.980 --> 57:05.540
any more money for you right now. So what you do, you get a nice upgrade bootleg machine

57:05.540 --> 57:09.540
anyways, since all of them are illegal over here anyways, and you take that and you put

57:09.540 --> 57:13.580
it in your arcade next to your DDR Extreme, which is still making some money, and then

57:13.580 --> 57:15.780
you make a new marquee for it, and whoa, there you go.

57:15.780 --> 57:19.260
Are you assuming this thing works? Yes.

57:19.260 --> 57:23.660
I wouldn't waste my money on the Nintendo. Hey, all the bootlegs for Max 2 and DDR Extreme

57:23.660 --> 57:29.700
work, why would this be any different? Because they're bootlegs in the sense that they are

57:29.700 --> 57:34.760
copies of Konami Official Things. No, they are hacked hardware. Somebody went in there

57:34.760 --> 57:40.780
and not only hacked the hardware, but hacked the programming. Why is that problem? I just,

57:40.780 --> 57:45.700
I don't believe it until I see a video. What are they showing here? They're showing a shoddy

57:45.700 --> 57:51.340
marquee and they're not showing any in-game shots, anything about the game itself. We're

57:51.340 --> 57:55.980
all going off just what this guy says, which, you know, okay, maybe it's right, you know,

57:55.980 --> 57:59.600
but I just, I don't get it. It doesn't make sense. I want to know more about how this

57:59.600 --> 58:04.640
is actually operating. Is it really all-in-one mix? Is it like one of those Taiwan 64-in-one

58:04.640 --> 58:09.480
games where you pick one of the games before you start the game? What is this about? I

58:09.480 --> 58:13.000
don't know enough about it and I would never spend $1,500 on it. I wouldn't. I would. If

58:13.000 --> 58:20.640
I had the extra money, I'd definitely buy it. You're very crazy. Anyways, all right,

58:20.640 --> 58:21.640
So there's that.

58:21.640 --> 58:23.440
It smells like burning in here.

58:23.440 --> 58:26.760
Yeah, it smells like burning because my VHD is cooking.

58:26.760 --> 58:27.760
Hey!

58:27.760 --> 58:28.760
You know what?

58:28.760 --> 58:29.760
I don't like beer.

58:29.760 --> 58:31.080
I know you don't like beer.

58:31.080 --> 58:34.000
Oh yeah, you can drink all my Coronas and stuff that I've gotten there because I bought

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
those home for free.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.600
Oh, I already told her she got one.

58:37.600 --> 58:40.840
Except I sort of like Corona because it doesn't taste like American beer.

58:40.840 --> 58:41.840
Someone drink the pale ale.

58:41.840 --> 58:42.840
Seriously.

58:42.840 --> 58:43.840
I'll take them home.

58:43.840 --> 58:44.840
Okay.

58:44.840 --> 58:52.680
OK. I think what we will do is we'll take another quick break. Can I play something?

58:52.680 --> 58:53.680
What do you want to play?

58:53.680 --> 58:54.680
We should play that paranoia remix.

58:54.680 --> 58:57.360
Do you want to do your new mix?

58:57.360 --> 58:58.360
Oh yeah, that's right.

58:58.360 --> 58:59.360
Well, hmm.

58:59.360 --> 59:00.360
Let's say a new remix.

59:00.360 --> 59:03.640
Wait, it's a game. It's a game. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:03.640 --> 59:05.520
Talk about your new remix, Loki.

59:05.520 --> 59:12.620
Well, earlier this week, we downloaded illegally off the Internet because we watched a video

59:12.620 --> 59:16.860
about the bad things about piracy and how it hurts the record industry, and then we

59:16.860 --> 59:22.300
said we don't care, so we went ahead and downloaded it anyways, since it sucked, and we downloaded

59:22.300 --> 59:29.900
the brand new album for Enigma, Enigma 5, which sucks. I believe it's called Voyager.

59:29.900 --> 59:34.420
Enigma, a great band. I love some of their stuff, like The Cross of Changes was an awesome

59:34.420 --> 59:41.100
album. This new album, Voyager, fucking blows. Well, don't you want to queue it up? Anyways,

59:41.100 --> 59:54.100
There is a song on there called Boom Boom, which is kind of neat, and so I mixed that with Echoes from 9th Style and I got no Boom Boom Echoed in My Head remix.

59:54.100 --> 01:00:02.100
So this is going to be interesting because a lot of you guys may not have heard Echoes before. It's kind of one of the lesser known songs from 9th Style, but it's got a pretty cool backbeat to it.

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:09.100
Yeah, and I just totally mixed it around and that's actually pretty decent for a mix. It wasn't hurried along at all, so it turned out pretty well.

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:12.620
up pretty well. Alright, so here it is, the world premiere here on Orange Launch Radio

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:19.100
of Loki's latest remix. This is Boom Boom, the Echoed in My Head remix. And it's Enigma

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:26.100
Anigma versus Dragoon, Anigma versus Dragoon, we'll be back!

01:02:49.100 --> 01:03:05.220
Alright, that was the world premiere of Boom Boom, originally by Enigma, but remixed right

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:08.820
there by Loki, the Echoed in My Head remix, so it had a little bit of echoes from Ninth

01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:09.820
Style in there.

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:10.820
So, what'd you guys think?

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:11.820
Boomy.

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:12.820
Good.

01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:22.820
Your chair attracts more microphone cord than like a pimp attracts hose.

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:23.820
Here you go.

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:24.820
What did you think of it, Bradley?

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:25.820
It sounded pretty cool.

01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:26.820
Yeah, I liked it.

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:30.440
He definitely made that album better.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.480
You know what pisses me off about Enigma now?

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:37.120
They were so good back when their first album and second album came out and they've gotten

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:42.560
progressively worse through albums three, four and five because the guy that does all

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:46.800
the writing is starting to use less samples and he sings more and just his

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:51.920
singing sucks starting to use less samples and more drugs basically

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:56.640
although I will say the fourth album has my favorite enigma song ever on it

01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:05.240
gravity love which has a cool video on it as Loki saw last night so yeah

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:10.000
gravity of love good enigma song the entire Voyager album bad enigma song is

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Is the video like watching a Bjork video?

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.320
And I left the CD at home.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.420
Okay, we're going to break with some Bimani songs.

01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:50.300
I'll play a couple songs that you can find. They're Bimani songs that are

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:55.480
typically in the game, but you can find them on the US V-Rare 2 soundtrack.

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:56.720
We're going to hear...

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:00.160
Oh, we played that first break, yeah. We're going to play the

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.440
Bad Routine,

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.660
and we'll play some Vanity Angel, because that's a good song.

01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:07.200
And uh...

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.560
We can play the really shitty I feel mix.

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.520
Why not?

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:11.680
That's short.

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.280
All right, we're going to do the I feel mix.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:15.280
We'll start off with the I feel mix here.

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.680
The New Age, here we go.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.600
This is, well, judge for yourself,

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.920
the New Age hope mix of I feel is going to start off this break.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:25.000
This is the New Age put me the hope of going to sleep mix.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.080
And we will be back with the Orange Lounge cage match.

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.040
Yay.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:29.840
Stay tuned.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.680
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:43.680
and the CD is currently spinning

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:12.500
I FEEL!!!

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:19.500
You will not hear the crappy, I feel, because...

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:23.960
because...

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:30.960
DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH...

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:34.520
COME ON!!!

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:41.520
well, we're going to eventually get this working

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:48.520
I feel it, I feel it in you, I feel it, I feel it in you

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:17.760
Ciao, ciao, ciao, ciao

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:37.680
I feel it, I feel it

01:07:37.680 --> 01:08:00.900
I see-ee, I see-ee, I see-ee, I see-ee, I see-ee, I see-ee, I see-ee, I see-ee, I see-ee, I see-ee, I see-ee

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:07.900
I hear it, I hear it

01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:32.900
Oh

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:32.900
I don't know what to say

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:34.900
YEAH!

01:11:32.900 --> 01:12:01.020
Mr. Random person on the street, who by the way is not an actor, what do you think of

01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:10.780
The music is like being transported to this dancing spaceship place.

01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:12.980
It's unearthly.

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:17.580
It's like being at a club, except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:24.220
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening here, episode number

01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:25.220
63 in progress.

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:28.260
We're going to get to the cage match in just a minute, but I wanted to ask you guys about

01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:29.260
this site.

01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:33.740
guys who were looking at this before the show. This is a site that somebody brought to my

01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:38.940
attention earlier this week in our chat room. Just head on over to www.calibomani.com, click

01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:47.340
on Orange Lounge and click on chat. The site is sexiestgamer.com. Have you guys seen this?

01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:52.060
Hold on, I'll bring it up over here for you guys that haven't seen it yet. And those of

01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:27.740
the whole idea behind Sexiest Gamer is about. Our mission is to prove to the world that

01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:32.820
gamers are not joystick jockeys glued to their keyboard. Our search for the sexiest gamer

01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:39.500
gives you, male and female gamers, the opportunity to send in your hottest gaming-related pic.

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:43.540
Visitors to the site will be able to rate the hotness of each entrant. We all know that

01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:46.620
being a babe means different things to different people. You don't need to be a supermodel,

01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:51.360
anyone can enter. Time to get on down. The first round of voting for all selected entrants

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.960
starts on the 2nd of October and continues until the 20th of November. Based on the first

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:59.280
round of voting, 10 finalists will be selected. Voting will then begin on the finalists. On

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:04.640
the 12th of December 2003, a live grand finale will be held in front of a celebrity judging

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:09.360
panel. The finalists will be asked gaming and personality questions and based on their

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:13.260
performance and their results from the second round of online voting, the judges will select

01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:22.820
the male and female winners. And they win a trip. I'm thinking, I'm thinking that Orange

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:27.740
Lounge, tell me what you guys think about this. I'm thinking Orange Lounge has a large

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:32.900
and sick enough fan base, tell me what you guys think about this, that maybe I should

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:41.660
enter. What do you guys think? Should I enter this? Do it? Would you guys vote me a ten

01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:49.060
if I entered I'm serious you guys I'm not going to do it if you guys are going

01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:54.460
to back me up and that includes the chat room all right

01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:57.940
where's your beer

01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:10.060
I don't know what happened to your beer Jamie.

01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:20.860
I have to think about, Jamie what do you think, should I enter this?

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:21.860
Would you enter it too?

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:22.860
No.

01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:23.860
Why not?

01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:28.360
I want some female needs to enter to represent Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:29.420
Erin!

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:31.220
I think you need to enter.

01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:34.320
Yes, I think you need to enter the sexiest gamer competition with me.

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.660
It'll be me and you, we're going to win that trip.

01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:42.480
We will get our Orange Lounge Radio legions of fans to vote for us the sexiest gamer.

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:45.620
But this is the thing is that there's so many assholes in the Bamani community

01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:50.740
that they're going to go and vote us a one just because it's us.

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:53.740
we have to vote over and over and over them

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:55.540
in order to pull this off

01:15:55.540 --> 01:16:00.540
if it's IP, log on to a dial-up account and do it

01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:02.860
I don't know, I'm thinking about it

01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:05.660
we'll have more details as we go on, but think about it

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:08.260
because if Aaron or I could win this thing

01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:14.980
then we could go on to gamer.tv and whore the shit out of this station

01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:18.580
tell me that's not a beautiful idea

01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:21.740
all right

01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:25.140
yes we will wear sexy orange clothes

01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:28.540
we will wear nothing but orange lounge shirts and pictures

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:30.940
you need an orange lounge suit

01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:33.260
an orange lounge suit

01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:40.260
no i'm serious aaron are you going to enter this shit if i do it?

01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:47.260
i will see what we can do

01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:51.960
Some more to come in future weeks on that.

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:57.320
We'll let you know next week where the sexiestgamer.com project stands.

01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:00.640
In the meantime, how about we have ourselves a cage match? How does that sound?

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:04.320
Sure!

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:08.680
Good, I'll give you guys some music to listen to while you're eating.

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:11.920
Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match,

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:14.840
there was another tie,

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:18.040
But the winning song was a little bit surprising, at least to me anyway.

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:22.720
My song won, and it was a song that was suggested to me by The Ice Bitch, who hasn't been to

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:27.040
a show in a while, but he suggested this before the show last week.

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:33.160
It's kind of a booty song, it's a song that maybe you could hear one day on Solo 2000,

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:34.160
something like that.

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:37.000
This song is like the epitome of booty.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.760
Well, here it is.

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:41.560
This is the song that won last week, and the first song you can vote for tonight.

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:46.920
Wait cage match works. Just a reminder. You have to be in our chat room to participate. It is a listener supported event

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:50.760
www.calibamani.com click on orange lounge and click on chat

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:57.240
I'm gonna play three songs for you guys after the three songs are over you vote on your favorite the winning song goes into rotation

01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:59.280
All week long on orange lounge radio comes back next week

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:04.780
So since this song won last week, you only get to hear a clip of it. Here's last week's

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:08.480
No, sorry, you can hear a clip of it. That's the rule

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:09.480
It's not fair to the other songs.

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:11.280
It's not fair to the other songs.

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:12.680
This is song number one tonight.

01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:16.080
The band is Fanny Pack and the song is Camel Toe.

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:17.080
Enjoy.

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:18.080
This little aged lady, I gotta be blunt.

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.080
I'd spend this mic as short as work, creepin' up the front.

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:20.080
I could see her uterus, her pants was in sight.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.080
She mustn't own pennies if we're not in sight.

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:22.080
She walked right by, the poor woman didn't know.

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:31.080
I can see her uterus, her pants was in sight She mustn't own pennies if we're not in sight

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:38.080
She walked right by, the poor woman didn't know She had a pencil wedgie, a camel toe

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:46.080
You got a camel toe, girl, you got a camel toe

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:54.080
You got a camel toe, girl, you got a camel toe

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:57.080
Girl, I gotta hurt, take some time in the dust

01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:01.080
Can't you see people staring at making the fuss

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:04.080
Cannot believe my eyes have to take a second place

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:08.080
If you crash hungry girl, cause you're eating your pants

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:11.080
Do you enjoy the commotion and the tension it brings

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:15.080
The only lips I wanna see are the ones that sing

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:19.080
And public put it on, and x-ray the show

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:23.080
Go see people out with your camel toe

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:27.080
Mm-hmm, that's right, uh-huh, I don't know

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:30.080
Think you so, girl, you got a camel toe

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:43.080
You got a camel toe First time spin round, let's make these girls

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:48.440
Alright that was song number one Fanny Pack with Camel Toe

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.720
Last week's winner Okay let's get on into our next song

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:55.720
Next song will be Loki's song Why don't you tell us about it, Loki?

01:19:55.720 --> 01:20:01.720
This song is featured on the Diverse System CD, Hello Boss, which is a remix CD of all

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:02.720
Bomani music.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:07.760
They are done by these independent artists from Japan who do a lot of the BMS files you

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:08.760
find out there.

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:15.720
We are talking quality music, the best beatmania files you will ever find out there.

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:22.520
It's definitely not this crap that you would see in a turning mix or something like that.

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:24.640
This is really quality music.

01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:31.640
they sell a CD in Japan, Diverse Systems. Anyways, this song is called P-H-1-0-7. Now,

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:40.360
what the 8-1-0-7 means, I don't know, but it's a remix of Paranoia that's fucking awesome.

01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:45.360
So, this is OnoKen with P8107.

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:22.120
I keep reading that as PB, I have peanut butter on my mind.

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:25.600
Let's go around and get votes from our studio.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:38.600
What other than that is like a different part?

01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:01.200
blow the crap out of whatever this paranoia respect piece of shit's gonna be.

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:06.040
So, um, it's way better, and this is another example of how Konami has failed this as a

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:12.560
company in producing a quality dancing game. So, um, you know, you can really save yourself

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:17.080
a lot of money and license some of these independent artists to make really kick-ass music for

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:22.560
almost nothing. But no, go ahead, license your expensive tracks that suck ass like Wannabe.

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:47.320
p0k3smot42o

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:52.320
And then you've got like Pernodie Evil that sounds like Krab going, AHHHHH!

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:58.320
Or Pernodie Red which has almost no rhythm into it.

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:03.320
This blows the shit out of any fan-made Pernodie remix basically.

01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:08.320
The only one I can actually see that's acceptable was probably Pernodie Massive.

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:10.320
I think this is a lot better.

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:11.320
Alright.

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:15.320
Did your friend that you brought along want to comment on this at all?

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:17.320
You want omelet?

01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:19.320
No, he's...

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:21.320
Seven.

01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:23.320
Seven.

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:25.320
Alright, Bradley.

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:34.320
Pretty good, but I'm not as impressed by it as you people are, but I'll give it an eight.

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:37.320
Okay, an eight from Bradley.

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:40.320
Violent Hypergirl, Chef Iron...

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:42.320
Violent Chef Girl.

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:18.400
Exploded yet it hadn't so I wasn't sure but now that I've heard it

01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:24.640
It's actually good, and I like it, and I give it a 10, and I just hope that we aren't all dead tomorrow

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:26.840
All right

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:30.940
Chatter seems to really take a liking to that one, but you guys it's not over yet

01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:36.240
We have one more song in the cage match, and it's Jamie's entry and watch tell us a little something about it Jamie

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:39.240
It's Delirium, after all, remixed by Svensson and Gyllen.

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:46.240
And they did the depend on you, Ayumi Hamasaki.

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:50.540
Ah, yes, a very popular trance mix of a Yumi Hamasaki from my U-trance.

01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:56.540
So, Svensson and Gilen with Delirium, featuring Jaiyo, I believe is the name.

01:26:56.540 --> 01:26:57.740
I didn't even want to try it.

01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:59.240
With a song called After All.

01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:01.240
Anything else you want to say about this before we play it?

01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:02.240
It's a good song.

01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:04.240
Alright, here it is. Jamie's pick for tonight. Enjoy.

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:36.240
It's like a melody

01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:40.240
I'm so sad it's become a bad strategy

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:43.240
You know I think of you now

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:47.240
Cause you are keeping nothing inside

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:49.240
No guilt or care

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:51.240
No need to leave

01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:54.240
We're messing up the night

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:59.240
Everything runs out

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:04.700
And you won't be allow,

01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:09.860
And you won't be getting put away from her love.

01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:13.640
She said she wasn't her that was representation.

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:23.120
And you won't be getting put away from her love.

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:28.360
She said she wasn't her that was representation.

01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:34.360
No time to say goodbye

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:41.360
Love is red, but it's green inside of me

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:45.360
After all she sees my left hand side

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:49.360
But being a girl, she looks like a

01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:52.360
Picture behind a closed eye

01:29:52.360 --> 01:30:21.000
Okay, that was song number three, Delirium, featuring Jayo, with after all the Sensen

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:39.000
kostjamrh It's a good contrast to the other song too, and certainly to song 1, because it has vocals. It's nice, I like it, I dig it.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:15.000
The first time is on numerous CDs, so it's really worn out to me.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Plus, I have the CD. It's somewhere around here.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Oh.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000
No, that's... Yeah. Eh. Eh.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Well, all right. But is it the Spencer and Gillen mix?

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Eh. Eh.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Give it a number already.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.000
I give it number...

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Two.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
No, I'm joking. No, I give it a...

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Eight.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:54.000
I'll give it a 9. I like the song, the lyrics, the way they actually did the trance itself. It doesn't make it sound like no GTS or generic trance shit.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Alright, Bradley.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.000
That's pretty good. I'll give it an 8.5.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Silent Hypergirl.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:21.000
kostjamrh It's a decent song, it didn't really catch my attention and suck me in, like a song I like would have, so I'll give it an 8.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.780
All right, that's the vote.

01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:24.880
That's interesting.

01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:28.440
Both songs entered it against last week's winners.

01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:31.780
Nobody gave either one anything below an 8, which is kind of interesting.

01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:35.860
I don't think it's ever happened before, usually someone's giving someone else a 4.

01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:38.380
No, you can't change your vote.

01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:39.900
Too late.

01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:45.280
So, all the songs are well liked by the studio tonight.

01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:46.960
They're saying except number one.

01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:49.460
Well, number one won last week, so somebody liked it.

01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:56.340
Here's a quick recap before we let you vote and you will be voting by sending private

01:32:56.340 --> 01:32:59.060
messages to Sky but here you go, here's a quick recap.

01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:16.060
Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is P8107.

Alright, song number three you can vote for tonight is Delirium featuring Dalil with After

01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:39.100
After all, the Svensson and Gielland mix.

You guys have about three minutes to place your votes for the CAGEMATCH.

01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:14.460
So Jonas, you showed up before we got into CAGEMATCH.

01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:15.460
What's new with you?

01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:16.460
We haven't seen you in a while.

01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:17.460
Oh, not much.

01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:18.460
College.

01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:23.240
We made a few DWIs.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:24.240
And you want to plug those?

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.780
Where can people find them and what are they called?

01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:29.780
What's on my website? www.gameroom.com

01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:33.780
slash explicit

01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:37.780
Hold on, let me see if you were typing it right.

01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:41.780
Huh? What are you going to do here? Just make sure you spell explicit

01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:45.780
right, because if you spell it wrong, you get the wrong link.

01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:49.780
Like that?

01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:53.780
Okay, x x x p l i z i t

01:34:53.780 --> 01:35:13.100
The last time I came here, I've only had like around 7 SIM files, now I have like 11 released,

01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:19.900
including Paranoia Massive, for those of whom I've tried out.

01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:21.380
Who's the friend that you brought with you tonight?

01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:22.820
That's my cousin.

01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:25.140
Oh, your cousin.

01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:27.060
Let's say hello to the cousin.

01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:30.540
Is he?

01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:32.060
Oh, he's a little radio shy.

01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:34.060
Yeah, he's one of the buildings on the roof.

01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:35.060
Oh, OK.

01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:36.340
This is Erwin.

01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:37.260
Hi, Erwin.

01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:39.300
How you doing?

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:40.980
He's quiet, all right, all right, that's fine.

01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:41.480
That's fine.

01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:47.140
Let's see, what else is new?

01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:50.260
Loki, you got a minute over there?

01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:51.260
You got a minute over there, Logie?

01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:52.260
Here he comes.

01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:56.940
I just wanted to know if you would tell us about, don't tap the mic, because that goes

01:35:56.940 --> 01:36:01.740
over there, if you tell us all what's going on in the Sim World.

01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:03.500
There's some stupid contest.

01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:09.580
It's called Turnumix 4.5 Plus, my ass.

01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:12.260
It's not important, so you shouldn't care.

01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:13.980
Too late.

01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:20.980
There's some contest that takes place in the middle of the two tourney mixes, like we care.

01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:26.980
It's got all Asian music because they're hating us Westerners over here.

01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:30.980
So, you Westerner haters.

01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:32.980
Oh no, that's done.

01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:35.980
No, it's all Asian music, yada yada yada.

01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:39.980
And stuff happens, people are excited, I don't care.

01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:41.980
That's it, it's just another tourney mix.

01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:49.980
The only reason why they entered tournament 4 plus is because people are sick and tired of this anime and trance category being plaguing tournament 4.

01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:53.980
Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that that music is popular.

01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:54.980
I know.

01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:57.980
Let me bitch some more about my tournament that I'm holding.

01:36:57.980 --> 01:36:59.980
Don't hold it then if you don't want to bitch about it.

01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:00.980
I know.

01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:02.980
Friggin' A. We're not going to miss it.

01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:06.980
Hello, there's a site called Bomani Sims, or should I say Bomani Style.

01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:08.980
New music comes up there all the time.

01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:13.580
it's not all trance and you know anime music other music exists out there but

01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:17.500
you limit everyone by what you can put in there so you don't get anything good

01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:25.060
stop whining in fact there's been some real shit on the money styles I think I

01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:32.340
see some country songs in there and some just some weird shit yes I agree term

01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:37.140
mix is run by stupid people well some super people how the hell they put

01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:42.140
Legend of Art 3rd place in T4

01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:12.140
Here's a hint. I would like to just give the tourney mix planners, the people who plan the next tourney mix, some advice.

01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:18.140
And let me tell you something here right out the gate. No matter what you do, people are going to bitch that the contest sucks.

01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:22.140
So don't even listen to us, don't listen to the chat room, whatever. If you're happy doing your thing, do your thing, okay?

01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:28.140
Because somebody's going to not like it and you're just going to have to deal with that. That's part of doing things and having a big tournament.

01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:35.140
So, tourney mix five, if you do it. This is my suggestion. You need to do it like American Idol style, basically.

01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:38.980
where when people submit their entries you not be afraid to reject them

01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:42.580
on the spot because there is too much shit that's getting in through the

01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:46.500
the cracks and people are wasting their time and your bandwidth downloading them

01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:50.040
and if people do not put the effort to make original backgrounds

01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:54.780
some sort of song that needs to have some audio quality set on it

01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:58.820
they need to be 192 or whatever quality they need to have some kind of audio

01:38:58.820 --> 01:38:59.380
quality

01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:02.860
set on it. If they're not meeting these minimal standards do not waste my bandwidth

01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:12.860
1. Learn how to draw. It's not that hard if you can't draw, take someone's picture, make it look nice, put a title on it, done. Give credit where it's due.

01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:23.860
2. Don't draw shit in paint, it looks like crap. And I've seen so many sim files where the banner art and stuff is just like utter shit. I don't care if you can't draw, it's not that difficult.

01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:30.860
Use fucking Photoshop filters, it's not that hard. I don't draw that much in Photoshop, but I use filters out of the ass, and it looks good.

01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:39.860
So, just do that, and just, you know, pick good songs, you know, pick this crap, cut it good if, you know, you're good at that.

01:39:39.860 --> 01:39:49.860
Make sure the steps sync and make sense and aren't insanely hard, and number one of all things they should do is do not put who made the file on the file.

01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:57.860
Because when you do that you make people want to play these files because, oh, it's this person and they won't play the file, they'll just vote because they like this person.

01:39:57.860 --> 01:40:00.860
No, if you don't put, you know, what person is...

01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:01.860
BMR.

01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:10.860
Yeah, what each file is and who each file is made by. If you don't put that on there until the very end when all the voting is done, then you'll get a more fair vote.

01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:16.860
But when you go ahead and put, you know, who made each file and all this stuff and when you have people, you know, promoting their files like that.

01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:22.640
I don't care if you promote your files, but the fact is that people are only voting like 30 people voted on one file

01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:27.740
Which might have been pretty good, but you know the ones that suck like max whatever that was I don't

01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:35.540
The neo max neo max you know what oh wow oh you made your own little thing out of a MIDI program with you know

01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:37.660
fucking

01:40:37.660 --> 01:40:40.440
Fruity loops what they do should I pat you on your back?

01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:45.700
I don't give a fucking shit if you made that song cuz it sucked. It's just another max remix that sucks

01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:51.700
So what if you put more work into it? I put work into Legend of Trance, and you know what, I don't give a shit if it sucks.

01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:55.700
It's fine. You don't see me bitching about it. But here's the thing, is everyone's like,

01:40:55.700 --> 01:40:57.700
Oh, it's the BNDDR, it's so cool!

01:40:57.700 --> 01:41:01.700
No, I'm sorry, the thing I just played a little bit ago, you know, the Paranoia remix,

01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:04.700
that was 100,000 times better than your fucking song.

01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:07.700
Okay? That's what I have to say about that.

01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:10.700
Now, the fact, and that's another thing, is people are like,

01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:12.700
Oh, well I wanna, you know, vote for this, because...

01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:16.700
And they didn't really play the song, they just voted for it because they're like,

01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:19.700
Oh and you, Max is so cool, oh my god, this guy beat DDR.

01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:24.700
That also gets me into one point. Like, you know Boomerang, right? He's been done by BMR, right?

01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:29.700
He just re-edited the steps, putted it on, people just overrated his ass.

01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:35.700
With some of the things I've heard out of there, I think that a very loud fart would sound better than some of those.

01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:38.700
And I thought he quit making sim files like three years ago.

01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:40.700
Oh no, come on now!

01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:44.740
here's okay here's my this is why maybe I'm just gonna kind of play devil's

01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:48.060
advocate here and tell you why maybe they have not gone to the anonymous

01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:52.660
system let's say you submit in a file to the tourney mix and it's anonymous

01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:55.500
whatever but let's say I do it now everybody knows I'm not gonna enter

01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:58.660
tournaments because I know I'm not talented enough I go in and then I come

01:41:58.660 --> 01:42:03.080
on this station and say oh hey by the way you guys I entered to become one by

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:07.020
the Spice Girls in the contest and you all need to go vote for it at ten well

01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:09.740
there I've just fucked up the whole anonymous thing how are you gonna keep

01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:43.020
an entry. And then I come on Orange Lounge Radio and say, hey guys, look for my entry,

01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:47.340
such and such. Vote for it at ten. Well, now haven't I just ruined the whole anonymous

01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:55.340
thing? No, because guess what? Not everyone gets on this radio show and promotes their

01:42:55.340 --> 01:43:00.060
files except for me. But what about, let's take somebody like the well-known people that

01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:03.740
this is what you're trying to prevent is you're trying to prevent the well-known people from

01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:07.100
winning every time basically just because of the well-known ones and they're the ones

01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:10.900
to get their files downloaded. Well, now all these well-known people post on boards, and

01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:14.300
some of them will post their own shit. They're proud of their stuff, as they should be.

01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:16.820
That's just 1.2. Well, fine. Just make a rule against it. That's

01:43:16.820 --> 01:43:19.900
pretty easy. It's like they didn't rule about distributing files.

01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:23.340
But you're not a big brother. You can't see everything.

01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:27.300
Yeah, but there's thousands of little minions of mine that are running around boards, waiting

01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:32.140
to, you know, fucking turn this bastard in, because they also have a SIM file posted in

01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:33.140
I know.

01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:39.140
Can I say something about the tournament mixes and all the sim files?

01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:40.140
Oh hell why not?

01:43:40.140 --> 01:43:54.900
Well there's like a lot of people I know that are like underrated and making sim files but

01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:58.140
when I download some of them they're actually hella good just for the quality of the steps.

01:43:58.140 --> 01:44:06.140
Now the other thing, when is Sivis, the guy that runs DDREI, what does he know about sim files? I don't see him making shit.

01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:11.140
Now where is he? You've got MoogleHunter, he knows how to make sim files. He would be a good judge.

01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:13.140
I'm on your ruler, he's made sim files.

01:44:13.140 --> 01:44:15.140
But he has hard files, that's the only problem.

01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:19.140
It's fine, he's made sim files, he ran a sim file site, that's different.

01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:25.140
You've got the guy, those should be the judges we have.

01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:30.140
What are all these other people going like, oh, well your file sucks ass because I don't like trance music.

01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:35.140
Sorry you don't like trance music, but you know what, that doesn't have anything to do with this.

01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:41.140
They're like judging the song. I don't like this song. It's a sim file contest. It's about the file, not the fucking song.

01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:43.140
I don't care if you don't like this song.

01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:46.140
Or like, people who have made those SM errors, you know, step mania errors.

01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:48.140
Oh yeah, well step mania sucks.

01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:55.140
Well, that's maybe if DWI fucking updated their goddamn program within the last six months, you know, we'd have people using that.

01:44:55.140 --> 01:45:01.140
But I'm sorry, because StepMania is like 100,000 times better than DWI, so why don't you just have a StepMania contest?

01:45:01.140 --> 01:45:03.140
I know, seriously.

01:45:03.140 --> 01:45:10.140
Well, because StepMania is so that people can make files easy, because they're not doing it old school in Notepad.

01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:13.140
Cry, cry, cry some more for me.

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:31.140
The whole point of this thing and the argument we get down to at the very end every time is that this tournament sucks.

01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:34.140
The tournament sucks, just don't enter it, just whatever.

01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:44.140
That's what I do. I don't enter it. I don't give a shit. I just, at the very end, I download the files, weed out, like, the 10 that are any good, and delete the rest. And that's what I do with everything.

01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:52.140
I don't know. It looks like TurnMix is, like, a buyout, because anyone can throw, like, a porno video and get a number one spot on the TurnMix, even though that's just a quote.

01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:57.140
It's just a big joke. The whole thing's a joke. It was good when it was just, like, a little fun content.

01:45:57.140 --> 01:46:08.140
I was thinking about entering 34 plus just for the hell of it.

01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:10.140
Use that with existing sim files.

01:46:10.140 --> 01:46:13.140
I think I'm going to use that song from Winds.

01:46:13.140 --> 01:46:15.140
I'm not about it.

01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:20.100
I don't care anymore because, you know, if I want to get quality sim files, they're not

01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:23.620
made by U.S. people. They're the Japanese people that are making the sim files. They're

01:46:23.620 --> 01:46:29.140
the people back from when Dance Dance Evolution, that site was around. Back when Fifth Mix

01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:33.420
was coming out for the arcade and sim files were coming up for that back in Delight Delight

01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:40.500
Duplication. This site was up. This was the only place where you could get all your official

01:46:40.500 --> 01:46:45.600
no steps. This was the site, and it was run by Japanese people, and they also had originals,

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:50.760
which had all difficulties, and they were, you know, intelligent steps, really nice backgrounds,

01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:54.880
professional, done everything. And you know what? When that site died, people didn't realize

01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:58.800
that the small site with the originals is still up, and you know what? I get sim files

01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:02.520
from there, and they're a hundred thousand times better than all these stupid sim files

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:06.280
that people make. Well, this is most, actually, because, you know, people just don't give

01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:12.040
shit about how about looking at their steps and there's a lot of crap

01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:14.800
floating around out there because everyone thinks that they can make shit

01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:19.800
and I was like it takes time to make some fun that's why I don't place that

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:25.420
mania anymore I don't but I won't wanna get my cabinet are you boys finished

01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:29.720
venting now all right let's talk about I think we need to change the pace with

01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:34.240
the rest of you think you're all right let's see how about we announce the

01:47:34.240 --> 01:48:02.640
Tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge Cage Match, I have to say this, song number one,

01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:09.480
My pick didn't get a single vote, so we had last week's winner did not get a single vote

01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:14.260
and between the other two fairly close, a lot of people voting, but in the end the winner

01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:23.800
was P8107.

01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:27.600
People felt very strongly about one song or the other though just looking in our chat

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:33.660
room, so we'll just see what happens next week when P8107 comes back and does battle

01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:34.660
against two new picks.

01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:43.660
There's also another song that OnoKid did, you can play it at a later break. Yeah, we'll

01:48:43.660 --> 01:48:49.260
do that one later. Hi Jamie. Hi. Do you feel a little ranty after listening to all that

01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:55.940
venting? I took a nap during the ramp. Did you? Okay. Cause Corona makes me sleepy. Oh,

01:48:55.940 --> 01:49:01.580
We are going to take a break and when we come back you need to be woken up so you can do

01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:02.580
some ranting.

01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:04.040
I need to go club a seal.

01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:05.920
You need to show these two how it's done.

01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:06.920
Okay.

01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:07.920
Alright.

01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:13.440
Alright, we'll be back, we're going to take a quick break, we're going to start off, I

01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:16.940
thought we'd start this off with Echoes from Night Style so those of you that were listening

01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:20.360
to Loki's remix before can kind of hear what he had changed and all that stuff.

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:24.120
And then some other stuff, something from Guitar Freaks, something else from Night Style.

01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:47.680
We will be back.

01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:57.120
Yeah, yeah

01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:06.120
Move on now

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:09.120
Reach up and feel the beat

01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:13.120
Come on, wake up

01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:16.120
Let all your energy be

01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:21.120
And in the back of your mind I smile

01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:25.120
Blind in blood, so blind

01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:27.120
Just reach out, get off and out

01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:31.120
You'll be the star tonight

01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:32.120
Get with it

01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:34.120
Finalize

01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:36.120
You gotta tell me

01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:39.120
You know you should do it when you're dead, my man

01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:41.120
I should lie

01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:43.120
And set you strong, but

01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:48.120
You're not the answer to keep you warm

01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:58.120
Hey, hey, hey

01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:01.120
I just feel it

01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:05.120
You gotta feel it, yeah, yeah

01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:10.120
I'm a

01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:15.120
I'm a

01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:20.120
I'm a

01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:25.120
I'm a

01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:30.120
I'm a

01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:25.600
Hello, everybody.

01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:27.080
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:28.740
We hope you're having a good time listening.

01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:33.940
number 63 in progress. We're going to get to the FUs of the week. But first, some quick

01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:39.100
station housekeeping announcements and things like that. Just a reminder, we do have other

01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:45.860
shows here on Orange Lounge Radio now. On Monday nights at 7 o'clock, me, Vanilla Sky

01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:51.420
is the show, and Rice Princess and Lanky Style also come over and visit, and Loki makes cameos

01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:56.860
all the time. And we talk about game news and then other stuff going on. And tomorrow

01:55:56.860 --> 01:56:01.120
night show I will make my official endorsement for California governor and

01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:05.160
since my initial candidate I was going to vote for dropped out of the race I'm

01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:11.020
going to be endorsing someone else and the the answer may surprise you so tune

01:56:11.020 --> 01:56:17.120
in tomorrow the answer may surprise you so tomorrow to find out unicorn yes

01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:23.460
Tuesday Jamie what's on Tuesdays Tuesday is pump up the volume which is my

01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:27.460
request show. If you were hanging out in the chatroom, make a request. You might hear what

01:56:27.460 --> 01:56:32.600
you want played because I have tons and tons and tons of MP3s. So that's where I basically

01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:41.600
hold up my hand, extend the middle finger toward the RIAA. But I'm thinking of breaking

01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:49.680
out. I picked up the soundtrack for Initial D Special Stage, which is the PS2 Initial

01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:28.540
just until November. That is correct. It's on break because I'm building a cabinet and

01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:37.440
I need extra days. Also, working on something else for 2004, I like to call it the SC2K4

01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:43.660
project which only, I think, one other person knows about. And it's going to be very, very

01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:50.900
complex if I pull it off. That's something to look forward to in 2004. Also, something

01:57:50.900 --> 01:57:53.940
else to look forward to in about one month, Orange Lounge Radio is going to be upping

01:57:53.940 --> 01:57:58.860
the stream quality. Don't worry, modem listeners will not be shut out. Modem listeners will

01:57:58.860 --> 01:58:04.940
still be able to connect as always, and it's going to be great because the music is going

01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:08.400
to sound, if you have the correct codec loaded into Winamp, and if you don't, it's okay,

01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:11.940
the station will still play. It won't sound as good, but it'll still sound better than

01:58:11.940 --> 01:58:18.500
it does now even but it's gonna play DSL quality radio on a 56k stream so it'll

01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:21.700
be really nice for some of you guys that's in about one month as soon as

01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:28.200
live 365s get all gets all their gets all their getting another kick to the

01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:35.200
for being stupid. Alright. There it is. Alright, so now I think, Jamie, it's your turn to take

01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:45.520
Alright, so, now I think, Jamie, it's your turn to take the stage and give us some rants.

01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:46.520
How's that sound?

01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:47.520
Sure.

01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:48.520
Oh, this is bad.

01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:49.520
Here is justice.

01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:50.520
Here is punishment.

01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:51.520
Here.

01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:52.520
This is fucked up.

01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:54.520
Oh, this is bad.

01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:56.520
Here is justice.

01:58:56.520 --> 01:58:58.520
Here is punishment.

01:58:58.520 --> 01:59:00.520
Here is...

01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:02.520
This is fucked up.

01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:09.520
This is fucked up.

01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:17.520
This is fucked up.

01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:22.520
One night allergies wanted to murder me through my nose.

01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:26.520
I was going to be dead, but I took a shower instead.

01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:30.520
Another one goes toward corona and apple juice for making me burpee.

01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:34.520
This is the sparkling apple juice which is the best stuff in the world.

01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:39.520
Another epi goes toward all the stupid people that were on the road today.

01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:44.520
I hate them all and wish that they would wreck their cars far away from me.

01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:49.140
And another one goes to the stinky old man in my apartment complex, who walks around

01:59:49.140 --> 01:59:51.840
smoking cigars.

01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:53.480
Really stinky, cheap cigars.

01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:58.600
And the thing about really stinky, cheap cigars is that they make me so nauseous smelling

01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:02.560
them that I have been known to throw up before.

02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:04.560
Yes, very disgusting.

02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:09.280
So this old man stops me, because I usually, you know, just sort of touch my hand under

02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:13.000
my nose when I walk past him so I don't have to smell it.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:21.000
He's like, Hey, do you have a problem? Do you have a problem? And I just kept walking. But next time he does that, I'm gonna say, Yeah, it's you and your stinky smoke. So

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.000
I have a problem with how he stinks and what I have a problem with.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Another one goes toward my car in Meinecke for misdiagnosing my car potentially. It may not be the head gasket. It may be the valve job.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:44.000
And another F.U. goes to all the people who have said that they're going to sign up for my message board and haven't yet.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:54.000
It's just, it's, I don't, that's why I said, the people who said they were going to sign up and didn't.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:01:02.000
It's, it's, uh, willplay.duckchakra.com, sign up for it or I'll kill you.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Um, that was beautiful.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:29.760
p0k3smot42o

02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:32.760
I listen to me, I listen to you all the time.

02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:34.760
Oh, oh my god, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:38.760
How expensive everything was at Dave & Buster's and how I didn't have more alcohol.

02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:41.760
And that's it.

02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:47.760
Alright, Loki, you're next.

02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:53.760
My feet and myself were mismeasuring every single aspect of everything on my DDR pad,

02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:56.760
thus making them one hell of a mismatch of pieces.

02:01:56.760 --> 02:02:12.760
FU the old people because you drive too slow and you should die.

02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:21.760
FU is just VMB for not seeing me in my tags yet because I got pulled over by a cop who was saying that my registration was expired.

02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:25.760
But then after checking with his little dispatcher, found out that my registration wasn't expired.

02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:28.760
That's pulling me over for no reason.

02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:31.760
But he was nice about it and didn't write me a ticket like the guy last year.

02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:41.760
And then FU to all the women that are saying Arnold Schwarzenegger molested them in some way.

02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:47.380
you wanted a piece of that? You know you did, okay? He's a big hunky guy, don't tell me

02:02:47.380 --> 02:02:51.420
you didn't want any of that. Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh. You're just mad now that he's becoming,

02:02:51.420 --> 02:02:55.600
you know, a political figure and you're not, you know, you're not with that. So don't be

02:02:55.600 --> 02:03:01.620
a hater, don't be a hater, okay? And don't tell me, like, that this stuff isn't, like,

02:03:01.620 --> 02:03:05.760
totally just because, you know, he's gonna win the election. Because, you know, that's

02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:09.600
why you're coming out, like, a few days before, like, oh, I just now got the courage to tell

02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:14.600
duke, i thought you guys molested me or touched my ass or something like that

02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:23.600
whatever, it's like a big coincidence that we don't know this and davis is like oh i didn't pay these people at all to say this stuff, not at all

02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:25.600
um, so f u them

02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:27.600
and um, f u to um, roe

02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:29.600
because you got mauled by a tiger

02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:31.600
and you know what?

02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:35.600
maybe if you weren't like, you know

02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:43.600
The Tiger was jealous because you weren't showing it any love. You were loving the other lions and tigers and bears, oh my.

02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:51.600
The Tiger just couldn't understand why you liked the small penis but not the big penis.

02:03:51.600 --> 02:04:01.600
Anyways, F you to Game Show Network for airing that show called Who Wants to Be the Governor of California.

02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:05.600
Never in my life have I seen a more retarded show.

02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:10.600
If anything, Mary Carey should never run for office ever.

02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:14.600
In fact, she should just kind of disappear because no one wants to hear her talk.

02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:17.600
Because she's an idiot. A complete idiot.

02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:20.600
But you know what? This is why I think she should win.

02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:25.600
Because I would like at this point to see California just crash and burn.

02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:30.600
Like the big space shuttle crash earlier, you know?

02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:44.600
It's just like, just burn. I just want to say, go down and just die. California just needs to die, you know.

02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:55.600
And, oh yeah, F you to the government for actually searching for weapons of mass destruction. You ain't going to find them.

02:04:55.600 --> 02:05:06.600
Stop wasting, just cop to it, you know, we didn't like, we made up that there were, you know, weapons of mass destruction, but what are you gonna do? We already destroyed them and now we're rebuilding them. Get over it.

02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:26.760
FU to certain websites out there that have flash or shockwave animations that play music

02:05:26.760 --> 02:05:33.720
when you go to their goddamn site every week until you turn that shit off. No one wants

02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:34.720
They hear it.

02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:35.720
It's annoying.

02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:36.720
Turn it off.

02:05:36.720 --> 02:05:38.720
Your global flash animation.

02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:39.720
Cool.

02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:40.720
Music.

02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:41.720
Not cool.

02:05:41.720 --> 02:05:42.720
Finally.

02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:43.720
F.U. to sports.

02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:44.720
I don't care.

02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:45.720
Why do the rest of you?

02:05:45.720 --> 02:05:58.880
F.U. to Dave and Busters because everything is so expensive there and you kicked everyone

02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:04.680
out at 1030 that was under 18 or I mean under 21 sorry over 18 but under 21 and

02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:08.640
you know screw that we weren't there we were their escorts we were their parents

02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:12.480
for the evening why you got to kick them out they weren't drinking most of them

02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:18.720
weren't some of them were I mean my god they're really bad about letting we were

02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:21.780
totally sharing drinks with other people and it was you know hey it was nothing

02:06:21.780 --> 02:06:25.240
but on the bright side I got a lot of people to come say they would come visit

02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:27.880
orange lawns in future so that was good we have a lot of guests coming from the

02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:34.880
Bay in future weeks. That was nice. Yeah, they can find me out here in the middle of nowhere.

02:06:35.420 --> 02:06:40.400
I think that's pretty much it. I don't have a lot of FUs. FU did the recall. I just can't

02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:45.240
wait until this whole stupid thing is over. It should never happen in the first place.

02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:52.240
And FU did cell phones going off mid-show. Just kidding. I'm kidding. Oh, come on, Aaron.

02:06:52.240 --> 02:06:56.240
Yours does it all the time, so does mine. I'm kidding.

02:06:56.240 --> 02:07:00.240
Um...

02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:04.240
Oh, F you to Walmart, Target, and the bookstore,

02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:08.240
and Ralph's, and the paper store, and the Folsom Outlets,

02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:12.240
because none of them carry giant birthday cards.

02:07:12.240 --> 02:07:16.240
And I'm too lazy to go all the way to Sunrise Mall.

02:07:16.240 --> 02:07:20.240
You people need to be more practical and think about my needs, because the world revolves around me.

02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:45.000
p0k3smot42o

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:51.000
victor my name is not meant to be written in leet to stop it

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.480
first of all

02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:55.520
fuck the eye

02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:58.400
no one wants to pay twenty dollars for your shit

02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:01.360
come on we've downloaded mp3's for a reason

02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:06.600
to just try and see if it's a good music and all

02:08:06.600 --> 02:08:12.600
who wants to spend twenty bucks for a sucky song

02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:17.800
yeah exactly

02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:22.160
fuck some bitches try to shit on my car

02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:24.440
yeah i have to clean it up and shit

02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:28.840
fuck some dog trying to lick my balls off

02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:29.720
okay

02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:30.600
at that

02:08:30.600 --> 02:08:34.040
what were you doing with your balls exposed to a dog so they can lick them

02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:35.560
okay i was outside

02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:36.640
running

02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:38.720
and suddenly some dog tried chasing me

02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:45.720
Remember, it's not cheating if you put some peanut butter all over your balls and have a dog wick it off.

02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:29.040
I guess Greg and Claudio agree on me with this, FU to math homework, lots and lots and

02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:37.520
lots of math homework, do we have a test in like a week, unfortunately, god damn mid term.

02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:40.480
FU to stinky people who play Initial D

02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:44.280
or it's that particular large fat

02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:47.240
nerdy looking smelly guy that beat claudia

02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:53.080
at Initial D. She knows who I'm talking about. He was the equivalent of one of those really really fat

02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:54.800
glasses wearing anime nerds

02:09:54.800 --> 02:10:01.800
who take japanese just to figure out what they're saying. They can watch their enemies unsub. Etc.

02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:15.800
FU to Sean Davis of ECS 30, who is not teaching us any programming, who is going straight through everything and not actually teaching, because I don't know anything about programming.

02:10:15.800 --> 02:10:18.800
And yeah, I think that's it.

02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:28.800
And FU to Nosan for Para in IRC. Para is dead! Get over it!

02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:32.800
That was the one Bamani game nobody was playing in Miggle yesterday.

02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:38.800
I'm going to make Para's once I get my controller and get it running in StepMania.

02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:41.800
I'm going to make Para's for Mac 300.

02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:45.800
I'm going to work on my X-rated Para game, so just wait.

02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:47.800
Hey, I'd play that.

02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:51.800
I will bring Para back single-handedly or double-handedly,

02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:56.800
double-handedly depending on the technique.

02:10:56.800 --> 02:10:58.800
I don't care about that!

02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:31.180
just wasted my time watching it was hilarious I guess I have another one to

02:11:31.180 --> 02:11:35.140
put it on f you to work load 57 for being the most boring and shittiest

02:11:35.140 --> 02:11:41.340
class in on all of earth I want to die now so yeah

02:11:41.340 --> 02:11:50.520
Bradley uh did you fuck you to the job market and being evil fuck you to

02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:57.160
waiting for find out if I got a job or not fuck you for being discouraged that

02:11:57.160 --> 02:12:06.720
I probably won't I didn't do well enough or something let's see well fuck you too

02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:16.160
you too wandering my money for being lazy first way way way way way way way

02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:19.080
way too long

02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:20.980
and uh... fuck you to

02:12:20.980 --> 02:12:23.480
stupid americans who don't know math and hate math homework

02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:25.480
math rules!

02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:29.280
hahahaha

02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:33.280
yes i was a math major and chemistry

02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:36.120
hahahaha yes both

02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:38.120
best of them lately that's not because i know math

02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:43.120
hahahaha zing

02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:50.120
do anything except find it out.

02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:22.120
kostjamrh Just to interject something here, Think Free and Roy, the show is probably going to be cancelled forever.

02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:46.120
your turn

02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:48.700
begin by saying fuck you to the following ionic compounds

02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:50.100
silver sulfite

02:13:50.100 --> 02:13:51.260
stannous sulfate

02:13:51.260 --> 02:13:55.300
do not bring chemistry onto this program

02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:56.300
i had to

02:13:56.300 --> 02:14:01.660
okay i'm sitting here working on my fucking chemistry homework right now

02:14:01.660 --> 02:14:03.620
that's how bad it is

02:14:03.620 --> 02:14:07.020
is this fucking chemistry altogether

02:14:07.020 --> 02:14:08.500
i hate having to do

02:14:08.500 --> 02:14:10.500
dizzy work like this

02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:37.780
p0k3smot42o

02:14:37.780 --> 02:14:44.780
kostjamrh Yes, the People's Republic. I actually took that real life comic and put it up as my desktop picture so I could view it.

02:14:44.780 --> 02:14:49.780
kostjamrh Yes, Davis Made Famous by Real Life this week, that comic.

02:14:49.780 --> 02:14:54.780
kostjamrh The guy who draws us from the same town we are.

02:14:54.780 --> 02:15:02.780
kostjamrh Fucks the people at the UC Davis arcade for taking way too fucking long to go through applications for jobs because it's been a month since I turned in my application and they still haven't reviewed it yet.

02:15:02.780 --> 02:15:21.780
p0k3smot42o I have no enemies

02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:25.780
I have no enemies.

02:15:25.780 --> 02:15:28.540
I don't make enemies.

02:15:28.540 --> 02:15:30.540
Can't we all just get along?

02:15:30.540 --> 02:15:37.540
I think it's like whoever made Murder Burger changed their name.

02:15:37.540 --> 02:15:44.180
Because as cool as it is to have Red Rum Burger, it was as cool as Murder Burger.

02:15:44.180 --> 02:15:45.180
I need to go eat there.

02:15:45.180 --> 02:15:48.340
On the bright side, we just found out there's a Red Rum Burger in Folsom.

02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:50.340
We're going to go there one night.

02:15:50.340 --> 02:15:54.340
I haven't had the murder burgers yet because it's on Sutter Street.

02:15:54.340 --> 02:15:56.340
Ostrich?

02:15:56.340 --> 02:16:04.340
Just to answer, puppy, I wanted red meat because I really wanted a hamburger, but I don't eat

02:16:04.340 --> 02:16:09.340
beef anymore and I can't really digest it very well, so I had an ostrich burger.

02:16:09.340 --> 02:16:11.340
Ostrich sounds strange.

02:16:11.340 --> 02:16:12.340
It's yummy.

02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:15.340
It's really yummy.

02:16:15.340 --> 02:16:17.340
Who's next?

02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:21.340
Yes Erin

02:16:21.340 --> 02:16:23.340
F.U. goes to TapX Pads in Davis

02:16:23.340 --> 02:16:25.340
Because we opened them up

02:16:25.340 --> 02:16:27.340
Friday night

02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:29.340
And we found

02:16:29.340 --> 02:16:31.340
We found enough soil to pot a plant

02:16:31.340 --> 02:16:33.340
So yeah

02:16:33.340 --> 02:16:35.340
Yeah

02:16:35.340 --> 02:16:37.340
It's that bad

02:16:37.340 --> 02:16:39.340
F.U. to TapX for never cleaning their pads

02:16:39.340 --> 02:16:55.820
We will comment on them and make fun of them.

02:16:55.820 --> 02:17:00.820
AznBuddyPaul says, F you to school work and F you to negativity.

02:17:00.820 --> 02:17:04.940
That's it.

02:17:04.940 --> 02:17:09.380
Chaos would like to say, F you to Love is Drowning, original soundtrack version from

02:17:09.380 --> 02:17:12.540
Night Style, because the singing makes my ears bleed.

02:17:12.540 --> 02:17:15.060
Is that a Polteri song?

02:17:15.060 --> 02:17:16.860
I don't know.

02:17:16.860 --> 02:17:21.420
Oh, we need to play that new Polteri song that Loki found a little later.

02:17:21.420 --> 02:17:26.740
Maybe we'll save that for next week, or maybe we'll do it when we come back after F yous.

02:17:26.740 --> 02:17:31.060
Baka would like to say, my F you of the week goes to Initial D players of Riptide for being

02:17:31.060 --> 02:17:32.700
such pains in the asses.

02:17:32.700 --> 02:17:38.060
the machine and hog the F-Zero machine and call it the initial D on crack. They don't

02:17:38.060 --> 02:17:42.220
know shit about F-Zero and why do they play it? Because the machine gives out free cards,

02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:47.220
bastards. BHG would like to respond to you. Well, tell us something we don't know. Come

02:17:47.220 --> 02:17:57.220
on now. Every time I go here, it's like all the same things. All right. Minsk would like

02:17:57.220 --> 02:18:01.940
to say F-you to the entirety of my college physics department. All the professors have

02:18:31.940 --> 02:18:36.060
the teacher to ask me if I knew the difference between Nico and Inu. One page had a cat,

02:18:36.060 --> 02:18:40.140
the picture of the other had a dog. Look lady, teach us to count Japanese before you call

02:18:40.140 --> 02:18:47.540
out page numbers in Japanese. Marin would like to say, oh by the way, Marin

02:18:47.540 --> 02:18:53.220
made a funny earlier. She said, Siegfried's been mauled by a tiger before. If they stop

02:18:53.220 --> 02:18:59.140
sleeping with the tigers, they might not get mauled so much. Marin would like to say, here

02:18:59.140 --> 02:19:04.620
here be my f-u of the week. Add to you the financial aid office at the local college.

02:19:04.620 --> 02:19:08.320
Apparently they didn't distribute any of my financial aid money to any of my classes.

02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:12.220
So I got a lovely letter in the mail yesterday from the administration office saying that

02:19:12.220 --> 02:19:13.380
I have a total attempt- Wait, wait, wait.

02:19:13.380 --> 02:19:16.500
To pay for all my classes otherwise I'll be removed from all of them.

02:19:16.500 --> 02:19:18.500
Shred that over. Well if you guys would listen.

02:19:18.500 --> 02:19:21.440
No, no, no, because I can actually comment on this one.

02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:25.820
Alright. Add to you to the financial aid office at the local college. Apparently they didn't

02:19:25.820 --> 02:19:29.940
to distribute any of my financial aid money to any of my classes. So I got a lovely letter

02:19:29.940 --> 02:19:33.380
in the mail yesterday from the administration office saying that I have until the 10th to

02:19:33.380 --> 02:19:35.820
pay for all my classes otherwise I'd be removed from all of them.

02:19:35.820 --> 02:19:38.820
Speak to the director of financial aid if they won't help you contact the Department

02:19:38.820 --> 02:19:42.420
of Education and turn their asses in. I should know.

02:19:42.420 --> 02:19:44.700
Straight to Tami's mouth. She's listening.

02:19:44.700 --> 02:19:50.860
I work for student loans. If the school is not going to work with you, if the school

02:19:50.860 --> 02:19:54.820
does direct lending, contact the Department of Education. If not, find out who your lender

02:19:54.820 --> 02:19:59.420
is and contact them. They can work with the school.

02:19:59.420 --> 02:20:03.420
And Maren says, yes ma'am. Yes.

02:20:03.420 --> 02:20:10.500
I will tell her that, well I'll tell you. Tomorrow I will send you an IM with the Department

02:20:10.500 --> 02:20:16.500
of Education's 800 number. Maren says, yes ma'am. She's on that. Alright.

02:20:16.500 --> 02:20:21.260
And FU to Rick for not straightening out issues with our whole department complex. Thanks

02:20:21.260 --> 02:20:25.660
to him not correcting them. I'm being sued for rent for the last month we were there,

02:20:25.660 --> 02:20:35.460
even though we weren't there the whole month. End rant, K thanks bye. Moving on. Dork would

02:20:35.460 --> 02:20:39.380
like to say F you to counter strike for having so many hackers that can rip your freaking

02:20:39.380 --> 02:20:43.980
head off from the starting point. F you to work for not letting me off early so I can

02:20:43.980 --> 02:20:49.060
go home and listen to Orange Lounge Radio. I'm here today because I asked for off to

02:20:49.060 --> 02:20:53.120
to go to a friend's birthday. F you to my car because I don't know what the fuck is

02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:59.500
wrong with it. Now my chances of going to Mobile, Alabama for their tournament is slim.

02:20:59.500 --> 02:21:04.500
F you to my saving habits. F you to my DDR permanent tacking because it all...

02:21:04.500 --> 02:21:09.500
If there's a tournament next month, I'm going to be in Mobile next month.

02:21:09.500 --> 02:21:15.140
Wow! That's my freakin' hometown. You need to cover the tournament in Mobile for us.

02:21:15.140 --> 02:21:18.820
That's my freakin' hometown. I'll do it. You need to research that. Get in contact with

02:21:18.820 --> 02:21:25.020
I'm actually in the chat room even though I'm technically not there because I'm logged

02:21:25.020 --> 02:21:26.020
in at home.

02:21:26.020 --> 02:21:29.860
Dr. Sakura, SSF, that's me, send me a PM with the details.

02:21:29.860 --> 02:21:30.860
Dork, do that.

02:21:30.860 --> 02:21:31.860
Okay.

02:21:31.860 --> 02:21:37.220
Dork would also like to say F you to the Saints for losing again.

02:21:37.220 --> 02:21:40.660
So what else is new?

02:21:40.660 --> 02:21:45.780
Tao would like to say F you to my roommates for monopolizing the PS2 with Disgaea and

02:21:45.780 --> 02:21:53.780
I'm gonna take you to GTA and my sacred FFTA from me, which if I remember, didn't he mooch that from somebody else? I believe so.

02:21:53.780 --> 02:21:57.780
Alright. But anyway, would you like to respond, puppy?

02:21:57.780 --> 02:21:58.780
No? Okay.

02:21:58.780 --> 02:22:04.780
You know, I've had this horrible urge to play Parappa 2 lately.

02:22:04.780 --> 02:22:07.780
Alright.

02:22:07.780 --> 02:22:13.780
In all seriousness, he says, F you to, um, well shit, this was a good week for me, F you to not having much to bitch at.

02:22:13.780 --> 02:22:20.780
No Stylin, stop parrying in the chat room.

02:22:20.780 --> 02:22:40.780
Speaking of No Stylin, screw people that drive slow, F you for people that wear transparent shoes, F you for not having 40 cent days at McDonalds, F you to Comcast, F you to my car which has been dead for 3 months, F you to people that play Warcraft 3 all day and have nothing better to do, F you to expensive

02:22:40.780 --> 02:22:47.420
better to do. F you to expensive Goosh paint? I don't know. What in the hell is that? Does

02:22:47.420 --> 02:22:54.740
any artist here know what that is? G-H-O-U-C-E? Juice? Goosh? I don't know. I've never heard

02:22:54.740 --> 02:23:00.900
of it. They come in these small 2.4 ounces and cost 6 to 9 dollars and they get used

02:23:00.900 --> 02:23:05.900
up after a single project. Good job Sky and Jamie. On what? I don't know. She says good

02:23:05.900 --> 02:23:12.900
cuz we rock

02:23:14.220 --> 02:23:15.700
i don't know

02:23:15.700 --> 02:23:22.700
okay i don't know you want to respond to uh... no silent

02:23:23.820 --> 02:23:25.540
pdr mike would like to say

02:23:25.540 --> 02:23:33.540
at future the drug mexican who showed me his dealing with

02:23:33.540 --> 02:23:40.540
well mike if you hadn't looked so interested

02:23:41.500 --> 02:23:45.500
dork says that the tournament is on november first in mobile alabama

02:23:45.500 --> 02:23:48.820
tell him to private message me the details

02:23:48.820 --> 02:23:55.820
because it's actually probably the day i'm flying in

02:23:58.100 --> 02:23:59.980
and there's lots of typing going on

02:23:59.980 --> 02:24:02.980
I'm relaying the message as she says, yes ma'am.

02:24:02.980 --> 02:24:10.980
Alright, no but, if it's on the first then I likely can't attend because it's the day I'm planning on flying in unless I can fly in the day before.

02:24:10.980 --> 02:24:12.980
So just give me details.

02:24:12.980 --> 02:24:19.980
I need details, times, locations, is it at, you know, cyber station or what, let me know.

02:24:19.980 --> 02:24:22.980
Alright, that's it for the FUs of the week.

02:24:22.980 --> 02:24:24.980
Finally.

02:24:24.980 --> 02:24:28.980
Oh, Erin would like to say something to you all?

02:24:28.980 --> 02:24:37.340
Oh, Baka, I know you like PETA, but stop advertising it in the chat for the goddamn last time.

02:24:37.340 --> 02:24:41.060
How many times does this say this parrot is dead?

02:24:41.060 --> 02:24:42.060
Jeez.

02:24:42.060 --> 02:24:44.060
Until I bring it back.

02:24:44.060 --> 02:24:49.180
No Stylin says, GJ, that's good job, for Loki.

02:24:49.180 --> 02:24:53.300
Don't know who he or she is.

02:24:53.300 --> 02:25:02.300
No silence says, um, GJ for Loki. Don't know who he or she is.

02:25:02.300 --> 02:25:13.300
Don't know who he or she is. It's alright. I don't care. I wasn't even paying attention.

02:25:13.300 --> 02:25:19.300
I'm sitting here with a smile on his face and he's kind of shaking like, it's alright, I don't care. I don't care, I'm going to kill him, I don't care.

02:25:19.300 --> 02:25:44.060
p0k3smot42o

02:25:44.060 --> 02:25:51.060
Go back to your chemistry homework.

02:25:59.380 --> 02:26:00.860
Chemists suck...

02:26:00.860 --> 02:26:05.660
Be a drug dealer.

02:26:05.660 --> 02:26:12.220
That's like street chemistry for ya.

02:26:12.220 --> 02:26:16.060
and it pays better anyways

02:26:16.060 --> 02:26:20.860
you know canada is so cool

02:26:20.860 --> 02:26:25.460
we should take a road trip there

02:26:25.460 --> 02:26:31.100
i don't know it's like we're like the sixties and canada is the seventies

02:26:31.100 --> 02:26:33.160
or what wait did the seventies suck

02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:35.100
the seventies had disco

02:26:35.100 --> 02:26:42.100
and remember your disco needs you

02:26:42.740 --> 02:26:48.460
i don't know why canada rocks because they're going to start selling alcohol in movie theaters

02:26:48.460 --> 02:26:50.040
i'm going

02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:52.780
i am going

02:26:52.780 --> 02:26:58.820
that's awesome. Drunk movie goers need to buy more popcorn so they can drink more

02:26:58.820 --> 02:27:05.820
Oh, and if you do my work, give me Geely, which is sitting on top of my PS2 right there.

02:27:06.820 --> 02:27:10.740
Hey, Zodiac Knight wants to share something with you. They actually made cocaine in his

02:27:10.740 --> 02:27:14.420
organic lab. Don't you wish you went to his school, puppy?

02:27:14.420 --> 02:27:17.020
Really? Yep. What a cool...

02:27:17.020 --> 02:27:22.500
Why would I be making cocaine? Why not? It's fun and educational.

02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:27.500
Alright, we're going to take a quick break. We're going to play two songs from the V-Rare

02:27:27.500 --> 02:27:34.500
2CDUS. We're going to play Tomorrow Perfume and I Need You and then I'm throwing in K8107.

02:27:34.500 --> 02:27:38.820
Oh, we'll do that. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So we'll do those second and third.

02:27:38.820 --> 02:27:43.940
But in the meantime, if you guys enjoyed tonight's cage match winner, P8107, you might enjoy.

02:27:43.940 --> 02:27:50.420
Look and tell them about it. K8107. Like I said, I don't even know who this 8107 shit

02:27:50.420 --> 02:28:01.120
is, but K8107 is a remix of Karma. So, it's pretty cool. But anyway, it's also by OnoKen.

02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:06.940
You can actually find it on his site if you search for OnoKen under muzi.co.jp, you can

02:28:06.940 --> 02:28:13.260
find him on there. Anyways. Okay, after this break, we'll come back and I don't know what

02:28:13.260 --> 02:28:17.280
we're going to do, but we might do some Ask Orange Lounge or something to finish up the

02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:21.440
So, about 9 o'clock, so when we get back from break it'll be about 9.05, so maybe we'll

02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:24.280
do some Ask Orange Lounge, because we have some new people listening tonight, we have

02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:26.840
quite a few new people listening tonight, and they might have some questions they want

02:28:26.840 --> 02:28:31.840
to ask, so we'll see when we come back. This is K8107.

02:28:31.840 --> 02:28:38.840
And that's the end of the video, thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:07.840
...

02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:13.840
...

02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:19.840
...

02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:25.840
...

02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:27.840
You

02:32:55.840 --> 02:33:15.840
The promise of love for the happiness I lose once or whenever I'm with you

02:33:15.840 --> 02:33:23.840
The fix that I waited for all of my life And I told you we don't need you anyway

02:33:23.840 --> 02:33:27.340
I need you, I need you

02:33:27.340 --> 02:33:31.340
You ain't got nothing, no

02:33:31.340 --> 02:33:35.840
Believe it, I know I want to love it

02:33:35.840 --> 02:33:42.340
I'm here to begin to love you

02:33:42.340 --> 02:33:50.340
So believe, believe, believe

02:33:50.340 --> 02:33:55.340
To me, to me, yeah

02:33:55.340 --> 02:34:24.340
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Bongo the man did.

02:34:54.340 --> 02:35:01.340
worse than confiscating.

02:35:24.340 --> 02:35:29.840
this, he says UltraMix looks very cool, which I'm sure it already does, I could have told

02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:34.080
you that, so we'll see about that. But one thing I was trying to tell him, I'd asked

02:35:34.080 --> 02:35:39.260
him if he knew anything about Sony putting out a new competitive dancing game, and he

02:35:39.260 --> 02:35:44.500
said he didn't. And I was like, oh, I gotta find this story about what was going on with

02:35:44.500 --> 02:35:47.940
Sony putting out the competitive dancing game, and I found it! So hopefully he's listening

02:35:47.940 --> 02:35:51.500
so I can get him all caught up on this story, so that's what I wanted to tell you guys about.

02:35:51.500 --> 02:35:54.960
This story comes from gamesource.yahoo.com

02:35:54.960 --> 02:35:58.900
Sony has released the full track listing featured in the upcoming dancing game

02:35:58.900 --> 02:36:02.000

would jump in Elvis with rubberneck in fat boy slim with praise you and Elvis

02:37:48.140 --> 02:37:53.900

02:37:53.900 --> 02:37:59.020
instantly accessible even for those with no rhythm so come on everybody let's get

02:37:59.020 --> 02:38:03.060
down a groove what do you guys think

02:38:03.060 --> 02:38:08.340
Gee, I like motion capture dance games because they rock.

02:38:08.340 --> 02:38:09.340
It's stupid.

02:38:09.340 --> 02:38:15.460
It's retarded and if you think people look awkward playing DDR, wait till you see this.

02:38:15.460 --> 02:38:17.740
This is nothing.

02:38:17.740 --> 02:38:23.260
I'm thinking, if it's some kind of camera that's capturing your motion, I'm thinking

02:38:23.260 --> 02:38:25.340
this sounds a lot like Para to me.

02:38:25.340 --> 02:38:27.700
Is it just me or does this sound like Para?

02:38:27.700 --> 02:38:29.820
The reincarnation of Para.

02:38:29.820 --> 02:38:30.820
And you said Para.

02:38:30.820 --> 02:38:55.580
p0k3smot42o

02:38:55.580 --> 02:39:01.580
25 songs, which will get old, about as fast as DDR Max 2 got old.

02:39:01.580 --> 02:39:10.580
So, you know what, this will be good for those people who are like, oh, oh my god, it's Madonna!

02:39:10.580 --> 02:39:15.580
Oh my god, I get this thing! Sign me up, that's me!

02:39:15.580 --> 02:39:20.580
Sign me up, I'm going out and buying this thing. I want to dance to music. Hey, Mr. DJ.

02:39:20.580 --> 02:39:22.580
What is that camera going to call you?

02:39:50.580 --> 02:39:56.580
where executives sit in a large room, watch the images, and laugh at you.

02:39:56.580 --> 02:40:01.580
Kick Andrew again, kick Andrew again!

02:40:01.580 --> 02:40:03.580
Why do I get to kick Andrew again?

02:40:03.580 --> 02:40:06.580
I'm sorry, that directive was not coming from Jamie, I can't do it in...

02:40:06.580 --> 02:40:08.580
Okay, Jamie said to kick him.

02:40:08.580 --> 02:40:17.580
And to respond to AZ and Buddy Paul, it's because all the idiots that started Para

02:40:17.580 --> 02:40:21.760
Para decided to start drama over it and if it comes up again see even more job

02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:27.100
and little is going oh no you didn't do their team right back that person you

02:40:27.100 --> 02:40:31.020
that's why I need to die

02:40:31.820 --> 02:40:38.760
all right as promised in this part of the show we'd like to take a minute to

02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:43.100
let you take some control over the show and have us talk about any topic you

02:40:43.100 --> 02:40:48.180
want us to in a segment that we call Ask Orange Lounge.

02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:50.640
And you can send those questions now over private message

02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:52.260
to Sky in the chat room.

02:40:52.260 --> 02:40:54.260
In the meantime, let's hear the theme song.

02:40:54.260 --> 02:40:59.780
["ASK ORANGE LOUNGE"]

02:40:59.780 --> 02:41:03.460
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

02:41:03.460 --> 02:41:07.100
What will we learn tonight on Ask Orange Lounge?

02:41:07.100 --> 02:41:08.940
What is Loki mad about?

02:41:08.940 --> 02:41:10.820
What is Dark Sakura mad about?

02:41:10.820 --> 02:41:12.640
What is Sky mad about?

02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:15.520
The answer is probably Aaron.

02:41:15.520 --> 02:41:17.800
Just kidding.

02:41:17.800 --> 02:41:18.300
All right.

02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:28.840
Question number one is coming to us tonight from Baca.

02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:30.080
And this is a good question.

02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:31.700
This is my favorite question that's ever

02:41:31.700 --> 02:41:33.160
been asked in Ask Orange Lounge.

02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:35.880
He says, Baca says, why are you so cool, Skye?

02:41:35.880 --> 02:41:36.880
Why?

02:41:36.880 --> 02:41:51.800
Let's go over this long list of reasons that I have.

02:41:51.800 --> 02:41:55.800
My response is another question, how many checks have you been taking tonight?

02:41:55.800 --> 02:41:57.600
Just as cool.

02:41:57.600 --> 02:41:58.600
Now now now.

02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:10.080
I think more than enough to get a piece of the cock I would like to say because

02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:15.540
face it everybody I mean we're in the 21st century now and everybody loves the

02:42:15.540 --> 02:42:21.840
token gay guy right and not only that but I'm a token gay guy on the radio I'm

02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:31.280
I'm the token black guy, so...

02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:33.720
Loki consistently bringing this show to new lows.

02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:37.320
Well, I don't know if you listen to half the people online who have never met me in person.

02:42:37.320 --> 02:42:40.560
I'm the token Asian girl.

02:42:40.560 --> 02:42:46.120
When the fact is that between Loki, Dark Sakura, and myself, we are like the whitest people

02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:49.000
ever.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:50.000
I don't know.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:54.520
I mean, my last name is White Man.

02:42:54.520 --> 02:42:55.520
Hello.

02:42:55.520 --> 02:43:00.040
Yes, but you need a fake last name for the show, like Jamie and I have.

02:43:00.040 --> 02:43:02.320
So I think your last name's going to be Black Man for the show.

02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:03.320
You're going to be Matt Blackman.

02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:04.320
Blackman.

02:43:04.320 --> 02:43:05.320
Blackman.

02:43:05.320 --> 02:43:06.320
Hey.

02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:07.320
Principal Blackman.

02:43:07.320 --> 02:43:10.320
Who wants to respond to Zodiac Night's comment, yay for token Asians?

02:43:10.320 --> 02:43:11.640
Yay for token Asians.

02:43:11.640 --> 02:43:12.640
Hooray.

02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:13.680
I love Asian people.

02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:15.040
I like everybody.

02:43:15.040 --> 02:43:18.480
I like everybody for dinner.

02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:20.400
Jamie says, I like everybody for dinner.

02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:24.720
For 100 people, how would you vote 100 people?

02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:27.000
All right.

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:31.240
Question number two tonight comes from AznBuddyPaul.

02:43:31.240 --> 02:43:33.040
I already sent this in email.

02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:35.920
Oh, I didn't even open the Orange Laundry Mail bag.

02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:36.880
I may have to do that.

02:43:36.880 --> 02:43:39.560
There's never anything in the Orange Laundry Mail bag.

02:43:39.560 --> 02:43:40.600
But here it is.

02:43:40.600 --> 02:43:44.440
AznBuddyPaul would like to know, why Sunday night for this show

02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:47.120
I'm breaking rules staying up this late?

02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:51.560
Well, when Orange Lounge Radio started, I was doing double work.

02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:55.800
I was doing another show on Saturday night under Station Live, which is still on the

02:43:55.800 --> 02:44:01.240
air because the host moved to Texas and has some new co-hosts now under stationlive.org.

02:44:01.240 --> 02:44:05.040
That's on Saturday night, so it just kind of made sense to do a show on Sunday night

02:44:05.040 --> 02:44:10.720
and that's what Jamie agreed to and that's what Matt started showing up to.

02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:12.640
But there's always the rewinds.

02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:13.640
Yes.

02:44:13.640 --> 02:44:14.640
Thank you.

02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:25.440
We keep switching them, Thursdays at 2 and Wednesdays at 4, Pacific Standard Time.

02:44:25.440 --> 02:44:29.160
No more Mondays because that's when Vanilla Sky is on.

02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:34.760
The reason why also, I learned from doing a radio show on Saturday night, although there

02:44:34.760 --> 02:44:38.680
may be a lot of people at home who want to listen, that ruins my Saturday night.

02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:42.080
I can't go out and go to places like Dave and Buster's and all that stuff if we're doing

02:44:42.080 --> 02:44:48.080
show on Saturday, and my wife comes first, as I believe Jamie and Loki would agree to.

02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:52.080
Oh, you have to answer 23rd Magus, he says I am the wise person ever.

02:44:52.080 --> 02:45:00.080
Yeah, he's right. Yeah, he is right, he is the wise person ever. But, it is Friday, Saturday

02:45:00.080 --> 02:45:03.800
night, while they might be good for ratings, we want to have a life, and if we don't go

02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:09.320
out there and get a life, we'll have nothing to talk about on this program, so deal. Sorry.

02:45:09.320 --> 02:45:12.480
But yes, if you don't like Sunday nights, you can't always listen to the rewinds.

02:45:12.480 --> 02:45:16.980
And there's also original programming on Monday and Tuesday, and soon Wednesday again nights

02:45:16.980 --> 02:45:17.980
as well.

02:45:17.980 --> 02:45:18.980
So.

02:45:18.980 --> 02:45:19.980
Yeah.

02:45:19.980 --> 02:45:21.980
But thanks for asking.

02:45:21.980 --> 02:45:31.820
Alright, 23rd Magus would like to ask, pink, purple, or teal?

02:45:31.820 --> 02:45:32.820
What's the question?

02:45:32.820 --> 02:45:33.820
I mean, why?

02:45:33.820 --> 02:45:34.820
Pink, purple, or teal?

02:45:34.820 --> 02:45:35.820
That's the question.

02:45:35.820 --> 02:45:38.820
Purple.

02:45:38.820 --> 02:45:50.660
Let me see if I can guess. What color should he dye his pubes? I would go with purple because

02:45:50.660 --> 02:45:58.700
you know that might offset your hair or something. You look horrible. It would also confuse people

02:45:58.700 --> 02:46:04.760
looking for a natural color. We already have a pink so maybe teal. You can be the artist

02:46:04.760 --> 02:46:15.600
known as Teal. Alright, 23rd Magus would also like to ask, 23rd Magus would like to ask,

02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:19.840
why do we have a gazillion ops in the chat room but very few are on consistently? My

02:46:19.840 --> 02:46:25.440
answer to that is, quit op begging. You know, I think it has to do just because we cycle

02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:33.080
in and out. We're all on at different times. Except for Puppy, who has no life. Angels

02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:07.080
just being in the ass. I do.

02:47:07.080 --> 02:47:11.080
Dork has a question for Jamie. What?

02:47:11.080 --> 02:47:15.080
When are you going to be in Mobile? If I can get the time off of work, it's going to be the

02:47:15.080 --> 02:47:19.080
1st through the 15th. Fair enough.

02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:23.080
Next question. Greg is Massa.

02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:27.080
Would like to know, what's for dinner? I wonder if he's asking what we had for dinner tonight.

02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:31.080
How about Chef Aaron explains. He's asking me, because he's treated me out

02:47:31.080 --> 02:47:36.540
before for food, so I kind of owe him dinner. Mystery meat!

02:47:36.540 --> 02:47:40.300
Well, answer the question I asked. What did we have tonight? Tell that to our parents.

02:47:40.300 --> 02:47:46.300
We had chopped up cabbage into strips with pork and, in Jamie's case, chicken because

02:47:46.300 --> 02:47:51.300
she can't eat pork. And we had rice. Always a staple.

02:47:51.300 --> 02:47:56.740
Yummy. It was very good. Puppy, do you have your hand up or are you

02:47:56.740 --> 02:48:03.100
just dangling the ferret by its balls the ferrets have the ferrets are joined

02:48:03.100 --> 02:48:06.420
like it for people who live in the south you'll recognize these like the little

02:48:06.420 --> 02:48:11.420
love bugs who you say oh well they're joined that's so pretty they're fucking

02:48:11.420 --> 02:48:16.180
it's like cat talk but it's ferret ferret

02:48:16.500 --> 02:48:20.740
seriously the thing is is if you catch the two bugs together and make a wish

02:48:20.740 --> 02:48:24.740
about the person you love and let them go then it's happy but all that you do

02:48:54.740 --> 02:49:06.180
Q. Why do people start drama over games like Initial D?

02:49:06.180 --> 02:49:11.420
A. People have no lives and have nothing else to do.

02:49:11.420 --> 02:49:17.900
People at certain arcades just think it's fun because they have no lives so they think

02:49:17.900 --> 02:49:21.460
in order to have a life you can start drama over other people's lives so everybody has

02:49:21.460 --> 02:49:27.520
of life and everybody is drama. I think that these are people who use video games to validate

02:49:27.520 --> 02:49:37.320
their sense of self-worth. Here is my 100% serious answer to this question. Any group

02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:43.480
that you do participate in is going to have drama. You hear about theater drama or football

02:49:43.480 --> 02:49:49.480
drama or whatever you're doing, there's drama. Because when you get people together, they've

02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:53.480
We've got personality clashes of the ass going on, and there's drama.

02:49:53.480 --> 02:49:54.480
So it doesn't matter.

02:49:54.480 --> 02:49:58.480
And then Iso-D has drama just as bad as DDR, or any game.

02:49:58.480 --> 02:50:04.480
Great, that's funny that you get your ass kicked by cats.

02:50:04.480 --> 02:50:06.480
Alright, moving on.

02:50:06.480 --> 02:50:08.480
Jonas, sorry.

02:50:08.480 --> 02:50:13.480
Do we people exist, so what to expect?

02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:14.480
Fair enough.

02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:19.320
Evil Naoki 2DX would also like to know, may I call you, this will be a question towards

02:50:19.320 --> 02:50:25.880
me, may I call you Robbie Puns from now on, or Robbie Pums, no you may not, but you may

02:50:25.880 --> 02:50:34.880
call me Sexy Rob, that is permissible, or the Pharaoh King, yes, why is it, another

02:50:34.880 --> 02:50:40.260
question from Evil Naoki 2DX, why is it that PT Cruisers follow me around whenever I am

02:50:40.260 --> 02:50:41.480
outdoors?

02:50:41.480 --> 02:50:44.960
I don't know, are you just attracting things that suck lately?

02:50:44.960 --> 02:50:46.720
They want to tap your ass.

02:50:46.720 --> 02:50:55.000
23rd Magus would like to say, he'd like to clarify the pink, purple, and teal question.

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:58.240
That was the M&M's poll, you dumbass.

02:50:58.240 --> 02:51:04.200
I would also like to say the M&M's poll ended about six months ago, you dumbass.

02:51:04.200 --> 02:51:11.080
Is that like a little anecdote in his five page joke book?

02:51:11.080 --> 02:51:13.880
I believe so, it's the foreword, it's the epilogue.

02:51:13.880 --> 02:51:15.840
It's the fifth page.

02:51:15.840 --> 02:51:17.640
Dork would like to say,

02:51:17.640 --> 02:51:22.880
tournament will be all day, just come whenever you come in, chances are we'll still be there, the November 1st thing.

02:51:22.880 --> 02:51:28.580
Tell them you may have a special guest then.

02:51:28.580 --> 02:51:31.720
Zodiac Knight has a question.

02:51:31.720 --> 02:51:35.220
1. Dark Sakura, will you marry me?

02:51:35.220 --> 02:51:38.780
You'd have to go against Dan and Dan is six foot four.

02:51:38.780 --> 02:51:40.940
I think that if he stepped on you, you'd be dead.

02:51:41.100 --> 02:51:41.580
So no.

02:51:43.340 --> 02:51:46.540
Yeah, in fact, tax my other man and then there's my mistress,

02:51:46.540 --> 02:51:47.220
Margaret Cho.

02:51:47.940 --> 02:51:51.100
Okay, well, he said he had a backup plan here.

02:51:51.100 --> 02:51:54.460
He says, if not, question two, Sky, will you marry me?

02:51:56.540 --> 02:51:57.620
Are you 18?

02:52:00.740 --> 02:52:03.100
Because I hate it when 17 year olds ask me this question.

02:52:03.100 --> 02:52:10.100
I hate it.

02:52:33.100 --> 02:52:38.100
I could, but I love him too much to kick him.

02:52:38.100 --> 02:52:40.100
EvilMauki2Dx has a question for DarkSapper.

02:52:40.100 --> 02:52:42.100
Why don't you let him shoot 23 Magus instead?

02:52:42.100 --> 02:52:48.100
Alright, I'll kick, you know what, that's right, what I will do, I will kick 23 Magus instead of kicking EvilMauki2Dx.

02:52:48.100 --> 02:52:59.100
They made the scapegoat.

02:52:59.100 --> 02:53:02.100
There, that was easy.

02:53:02.100 --> 02:53:03.100
Alright.

02:53:03.100 --> 02:53:04.100
That was beautiful.

02:53:04.100 --> 02:53:05.100
Alright.

02:53:05.100 --> 02:53:06.100
Do it again.

02:53:06.100 --> 02:53:07.100
I want a re-run.

02:53:07.100 --> 02:53:08.100
You want a re-run?

02:53:08.100 --> 02:53:09.100
Yeah.

02:53:09.100 --> 02:53:10.100
Let's syndicate this.

02:53:10.100 --> 02:53:11.100
It's the kicking 23 Megas the show.

02:53:11.100 --> 02:53:12.100
Alright.

02:53:12.100 --> 02:53:13.100
Alright.

02:53:13.100 --> 02:53:14.100
That's enough abuse.

02:53:14.100 --> 02:53:15.100
Okay.

02:53:15.100 --> 02:53:16.100
No more abusing the freshman, you guys.

02:53:16.100 --> 02:53:17.100
Fresh meat.

02:53:17.100 --> 02:53:18.100
Any more?

02:53:18.100 --> 02:53:19.100
No.

02:53:19.100 --> 02:53:20.100
No.

02:53:20.100 --> 02:53:21.100
No.

02:53:21.100 --> 02:53:22.100
No.

02:53:22.100 --> 02:53:23.100
No.

02:53:23.100 --> 02:53:24.100
No.

02:53:24.100 --> 02:53:25.100
No.

02:53:25.100 --> 02:53:26.100
No.

02:53:26.100 --> 02:53:27.100
No.

02:53:27.100 --> 02:53:28.100
No.

02:53:28.100 --> 02:53:35.100
question

02:53:36.080 --> 02:53:36.940
here is

02:53:36.940 --> 02:53:40.180
you know now if you do you have a question for dark sacra yes when you

02:53:40.180 --> 02:53:42.340
coming to san francisco again

02:53:42.340 --> 02:53:43.480
you know

02:53:43.480 --> 02:53:45.580
when someone pays

02:53:45.580 --> 02:53:47.980
for me to get to san francisco

02:53:47.980 --> 02:53:51.460
i don't know i i want i actually want to go

02:53:51.460 --> 02:53:55.760
on a saturday but i'm still dan and i are right completely redoing our

02:53:55.760 --> 02:54:00.080
apartment you know throwing out crap and stuff but maybe when I get back from

02:54:00.080 --> 02:54:05.320
from Alabama I might set out a special Saturday if I'm not sick from all the

02:54:05.320 --> 02:54:09.200
uber thick cigarette smoke

02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:16.620
yes yes 23rd Vegas you are a target you know big bright red bullseye painted on

02:54:16.620 --> 02:54:21.320
your ass big white target with the bright red bullseye painted on your ass

02:54:21.320 --> 02:54:30.080
to sell white. Oh, so that means that I can go to him to buy my deodorant. Alright. Never

02:54:30.080 --> 02:54:34.320
mind, I'll go to Walmart. 23rd Magus says, will you have extra medical supplies tomorrow?

02:54:34.320 --> 02:54:37.520
You'll need them. He's directing that towards me because he's coming. He wants to guest

02:54:37.520 --> 02:54:43.000
on Vanilla Sky tomorrow because he believes that he can play a video game trivia to bad

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:50.280
music and keep the volume at five percent. He's challenging me to own him at a video

02:54:50.280 --> 02:54:57.520
game trivia to bad music so we shall see I don't know Brad had it Brad kept it at

02:54:57.520 --> 02:55:05.160
only 15% last week while a rice princess went to 65 huh well why don't you want

02:55:05.160 --> 02:55:11.360
to put your money where your mouth is I know sheets on my bed tomorrow you know

02:55:11.360 --> 02:55:14.280
you could come clean up my bedroom if you want I don't I don't really want to

02:55:14.280 --> 02:55:15.280
Okay, then.

02:55:15.280 --> 02:55:25.280
My sheets smell like Shermy's butt right now because she slept on my bed.

02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:30.520
Okay, so I think now's a good time for us to close up the old mailbag for Ask Orange

02:55:30.520 --> 02:55:31.520
a lot.

02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:32.520
Oh, wait.

02:55:32.520 --> 02:55:33.520
Actually, I should check the email bag real fast.

02:55:33.520 --> 02:55:34.520
In the meantime-

02:55:34.520 --> 02:55:35.520
Have you deleted the spam?

02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:36.520
Hello?

02:55:36.520 --> 02:55:42.960
Will Jamie please entertain us with a song and dance while I open up the mailbag?

02:55:42.960 --> 02:55:52.480
I'm never asking her to do this again.

02:55:52.480 --> 02:55:59.680
And that was the horrendous sexual acts of two stuffed ferrets with a little voice box

02:55:59.680 --> 02:56:01.920
inside of them.

02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:09.160
The email box is orangelaungeradio.com all one word orangelaungeradio yahoo.com

02:56:09.160 --> 02:56:12.240
We just got that same question from Paul that says,

02:56:12.240 --> 02:56:14.040
why are the shows on Sunday?

02:56:14.040 --> 02:56:16.180
Sunday night, people have to get ready to go back

02:56:16.180 --> 02:56:17.040
to school or work.

02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:21.160
Did we get any questions asking if we wanted enlarged penises?

02:56:21.160 --> 02:56:23.080
In the mailbox, no.

02:56:23.080 --> 02:56:24.880
Damn it, I've always wanted a larger penis.

02:56:24.880 --> 02:56:32.480
For those people who didn't see it before, there's the pad.

02:56:32.480 --> 02:56:39.480
kostjamrh There's the pad, number one finished.

02:56:40.480 --> 02:56:47.480
kostjamrh There it is, no it's not bent, it's just a camera lens.

02:56:48.480 --> 02:56:55.480
kostjamrh I don't know if you can see that on the web cam right now.

02:56:55.480 --> 02:57:01.260
How many things are built out of wood out here we're going to close up the ask orange lounge mailbag now

02:57:06.440 --> 02:57:13.280
That's all we've got to say this week on ask orange lounge we hope you learned something tonight on orange lounge radio

02:57:13.800 --> 02:57:16.860
Who was the biggest bitch send your votes right now?

02:57:16.860 --> 02:57:28.860
now. Just kidding. Just kidding. If you vote, you'll get kicked. All right. All right. Yes.

02:57:28.860 --> 02:57:35.660
Okay, so it's about time to wrap up the show, you guys.

02:57:35.660 --> 02:57:38.340
Wrap it up in ribbons and bows. Wrap it up in ribbons and bows. Wrap it up

02:57:38.340 --> 02:57:46.420
in straps and buckles. Before we put the lid on the coffin of the

02:57:46.420 --> 02:57:50.620
show, we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, so let's start off with Aaron,

02:57:50.620 --> 02:57:54.420
violent hyper girl.

02:57:54.420 --> 02:58:01.420
Drama sucks, Para is not meant for community, the end.

02:58:01.420 --> 02:58:04.420
Jonas, final thought.

02:58:04.420 --> 02:58:09.420
Well, I forgot to mention this before, I was thinking about running a tournament in January,

02:58:09.420 --> 02:58:11.420
Book for January

02:58:11.540 --> 02:58:17.820
So if anyone wants to contact me about this tournament, just go to grfreak.com or the visionaries forum

02:58:18.700 --> 02:58:20.700
Yep

02:58:22.100 --> 02:58:24.840
Fuck it's just good. I'm just just good. Okay. I am I just

02:58:25.500 --> 02:58:29.580
Or just email me that's all or go to that site you heard earlier

02:58:29.580 --> 02:58:35.100
Well, I'm online like 24 7 so I am me at silly fobby girl. G URL

02:58:35.100 --> 02:58:41.100
Bobby is F-O-B-B-Y, and then I'll just forward it to Jonas, because occasionally you're online, right?

02:58:41.100 --> 02:58:42.100
Yeah.

02:58:42.100 --> 02:58:44.100
Yeah, occasionally he's online, so, yeah.

02:58:54.100 --> 02:58:56.100
Bradley, your final thought, please.

02:58:56.100 --> 02:59:01.100
I so hope I get a job soon, soon, ah, the doom is closing in.

02:59:01.100 --> 02:59:05.220
Puppy, your final thought?

02:59:05.220 --> 02:59:06.220
Chemistry sucks.

02:59:06.220 --> 02:59:07.220
The end.

02:59:07.220 --> 02:59:08.220
All right.

02:59:08.220 --> 02:59:09.220
Well put.

02:59:09.220 --> 02:59:12.040
Who hasn't gone yet?

02:59:12.040 --> 02:59:15.040
Just the three of us?

02:59:15.040 --> 02:59:16.040
Loki.

02:59:16.040 --> 02:59:24.340
Remember, for all you trainables out there, it's the middle hole.

02:59:24.340 --> 02:59:26.800
My final thought is stay tuned for the afterbirth tonight.

02:59:26.800 --> 02:59:29.420
It's going to be great.

02:59:29.420 --> 02:59:36.660
My final thought is I need some money and I need a maid to clean my house for me.

02:59:36.660 --> 02:59:38.900
I need a house, a big one.

02:59:38.900 --> 02:59:39.900
I need a compound.

02:59:39.900 --> 02:59:44.660
I want a castle with a moat.

02:59:44.660 --> 02:59:46.340
We need to have our own gated community.

02:59:46.340 --> 02:59:47.340
I like that idea.

02:59:47.340 --> 02:59:48.340
The orange line's gated community.

02:59:48.340 --> 02:59:55.780
Oh yeah, that link posted is wrong because Jonah screwed up.

02:59:55.780 --> 03:00:01.780
Game J, er, G-A-M-E, not N-E.

03:00:01.780 --> 03:00:03.780
Alright, thank you.

03:00:03.780 --> 03:00:07.780
Uh, final word of the show tonight will go to...

03:00:07.780 --> 03:00:10.780
Whoa, I don't think Puppy's ever had it, so let's give it to Puppy.

03:00:10.780 --> 03:00:13.780
No menclature.

03:00:13.780 --> 03:00:17.780
I don't have the outro queued up.

03:00:17.780 --> 03:00:21.780
Hold on, you get a second shot at it because I didn't have the outro queued up, I was lazy.

03:00:21.780 --> 03:00:22.780
Oh, okay.

03:00:22.780 --> 03:00:23.780
Sorry.

03:00:23.780 --> 03:00:39.300
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:00:39.300 --> 03:00:43.620
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki.

03:00:43.620 --> 03:00:45.980
We expect you a nice play again.

03:00:45.980 --> 03:00:49.020
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:00:49.020 --> 03:00:54.660
Well, here I am in my tubby again, and my tubby's all filled with water and nice fluffy

03:00:54.660 --> 03:00:55.660
suds.

03:00:55.660 --> 03:01:00.260
And I've got my soap and washcloth to wash myself, and I've got my nifty scrub brush

03:01:00.260 --> 03:01:05.820
to help me scrub my back, and I've got a big fluffy towel to dry myself when I'm done.

03:01:05.820 --> 03:01:10.220
But there's one other thing that makes tubby time the very best time of the whole day.

03:01:10.220 --> 03:01:11.860
And do you know what that is?

03:01:11.860 --> 03:01:16.860
He's a very special friend of mine, my very favorite little pal.

03:01:16.860 --> 03:01:28.860
Oh, Rubber Ducky, you're the one You make bath time lots of fun

03:01:28.860 --> 03:01:32.860
Rubber Ducky, I'm awfully fond of you

03:01:32.860 --> 03:01:40.860
Bobo, Bodeo, Rubber Ducky, joy of joy When I squeeze you, you make noise

03:01:40.860 --> 03:01:46.860
Rubber Ducky, you're my very best friend, it's true

03:01:46.860 --> 03:01:57.860
Oh, every day when I make my way to the tubby I find a little fella who's cute and yellow and chubby

03:01:57.860 --> 03:02:05.860
Rub-a-dub-dubby, Rubber Ducky, you're so fine, and I'm lucky that you're mine.

03:02:05.860 --> 03:02:10.860
Rubber Ducky, I'm awfully fond of you.

03:02:10.860 --> 03:02:15.860
Hey Rubber Ducky, would you like me to scrub your back with my nifty little scrub brush?

03:02:15.860 --> 03:02:19.860
You would? Okay, how's this?

03:02:19.860 --> 03:02:22.860
Hey, you want me to scrub behind your ears?

03:02:22.860 --> 03:02:26.860
Oh, I see, you don't have any ears, do you?

03:02:26.860 --> 03:02:28.860
Well, how about your tummy?

03:02:28.860 --> 03:02:30.860
Scrub his little ducky tummy.

03:02:30.860 --> 03:02:32.860
Ooh, he's ticklish!

03:02:35.860 --> 03:02:36.860
Oh!

03:02:36.860 --> 03:02:40.860
Every day when I make my way through the tubby

03:02:40.860 --> 03:02:46.860
I find a little fella who's cute and yellow and chubby

03:02:46.860 --> 03:02:48.860
Rub-a-dub-dubby

03:02:48.860 --> 03:02:51.860
Rub-a-ducky, you're so fine

03:02:51.860 --> 03:02:54.860
And I'm lucky that you're mine
