1
00:00:10,091 --> 00:00:14,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

2
00:00:17,816 --> 00:00:22,698
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, where Monty talks and then some.

3
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:26,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

5
00:00:31,103 --> 00:00:35,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

6
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:40,187
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:41,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I will spank your child.

8
00:00:42,388 --> 00:00:44,109
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

9
00:00:46,753 --> 00:00:48,723
Thank you for watching!

10
00:00:49,815 --> 00:00:50,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's to my big opening.

11
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:52,636
[SPEAKER_06]: A sphincter says what?

12
00:00:52,656 --> 00:00:54,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm super, thanks for asking.

13
00:00:55,276 --> 00:00:57,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

14
00:00:57,877 --> 00:00:59,757
[SPEAKER_04]: What am I doing here?

15
00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:01,498
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

16
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:03,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Dodge this.

17
00:01:03,538 --> 00:01:05,398
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a tasty burger.

18
00:01:05,658 --> 00:01:08,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.

19
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:08,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I have.

20
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Look, there's a flesh wound.

21
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:17,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.

22
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:19,333
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah?

23
00:01:19,554 --> 00:01:22,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

24
00:01:23,095 --> 00:01:24,156
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.

25
00:01:24,356 --> 00:01:25,256
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a sniff.

26
00:01:25,517 --> 00:01:26,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Skye.

27
00:01:26,157 --> 00:01:28,218
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

28
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:29,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki.

29
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:30,419
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate you!

30
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:32,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio.

31
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:40,004
[SPEAKER_11]: We are live, and this is episode number 63 for October the 5th, 2003.

32
00:01:40,424 --> 00:01:46,928
[SPEAKER_11]: You're tuned into the Bomani Scene's most sexually educated radio station of all things B-Money.

33
00:01:48,783 --> 00:01:49,704
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Rob Roberts.

34
00:01:49,744 --> 00:01:50,885
[SPEAKER_11]: You might know me as Sky.

35
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:54,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.

36
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:56,691
[SPEAKER_11]: In this corner, the happiest, most tardy bunny on the farm.

37
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:57,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's tardy?

38
00:01:57,692 --> 00:01:59,113
[SPEAKER_11]: You know her better than DarkSakura.

39
00:02:00,074 --> 00:02:02,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, everybody.

40
00:02:02,717 --> 00:02:05,840
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Jamie.

41
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

42
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Sak.

43
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie's not here right now, so I don't know where she's at.

44
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:14,765
[SPEAKER_11]: She's probably stuck in traffic somewhere and we'll be here- FUCKING OLD PEOPLE ON THE WAY OVER!

45
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:16,646
[SPEAKER_04]: THE DUMB BITCHES ARE RUNNING!

46
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:19,429
[SPEAKER_04]: She parked in my space and I told her to fuck off!

47
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:22,571
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I don't know where she is.

48
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:23,732
[SPEAKER_11]: She'll be here soon, I'm sure.

49
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:28,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, in that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

50
00:02:29,457 --> 00:02:30,418
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a trainer.

51
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:33,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Trainable.

52
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:34,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Trainable.

53
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:35,342
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a trainable.

54
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:37,985
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds like a lunchable.

55
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:43,553
[SPEAKER_11]: And also with us tonight, as well, say hello to our many guests we have in the studio.

56
00:02:43,593 --> 00:02:47,656
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the one and only Ted Puppy.

57
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:48,756
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you?

58
00:02:50,218 --> 00:02:50,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Tired and pissy.

59
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:52,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

60
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Also with us, say hello to the ever so lovely VHG.

61
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:00,845
[SPEAKER_11]: And that stands for many, many things.

62
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:02,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes it does.

63
00:03:04,648 --> 00:03:05,069
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you?

64
00:03:05,809 --> 00:03:06,430
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good.

65
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:06,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

66
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Also with us tonight, say hello to Bradley Arcadian.

67
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:12,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome.

68
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:13,906
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got mail.

69
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:22,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Also with us tonight is Nellie, but she doesn't talk, so we won't bother giving her a mic.

70
00:03:24,696 --> 00:03:26,317
[SPEAKER_11]: And she'll do sign language into the webcam.

71
00:03:26,337 --> 00:03:26,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

72
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:28,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I don't get it.

73
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:31,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, she'll be on the cam, but she won't talk.

74
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas Jamie will talk, but not be on the cam.

75
00:03:33,562 --> 00:03:36,724
[SPEAKER_11]: So, like, why don't you just pretend that Nelly is Jamie?

76
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:39,586
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, like, you know... Nah, it don't work.

77
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:40,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

78
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:46,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, plenty of things to talk about.

79
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:48,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, there she is!

80
00:03:48,211 --> 00:03:48,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello!

81
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:51,874
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

82
00:03:51,894 --> 00:03:51,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

83
00:03:55,307 --> 00:03:59,894
[SPEAKER_11]: We will... Jamie already says I hate people.

84
00:03:59,914 --> 00:04:01,817
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to say something before break or you want to wait until after?

85
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:03,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, she'll wait until after.

86
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:07,446
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll take a quick break, we'll be back and yeah, talk about stuff.

87
00:07:22,244 --> 00:07:22,782
Thanks for watching!

88
00:08:01,286 --> 00:08:02,211
Thank you for watching!

89
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:46,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio.

90
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:48,810
[SPEAKER_11]: We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

91
00:08:56,357 --> 00:08:58,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Howdy everybody, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

92
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:01,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we are at the start of episode number 63.

93
00:09:03,004 --> 00:09:03,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Whoop-dee-doo.

94
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:05,525
[SPEAKER_11]: What an exciting week.

95
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:11,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Not quite as exciting of a week as last week when we had Max 2 was out and new and all that other fun stuff.

96
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:19,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, Jamie's here and she brought with her, she brought the US versions of VRare 1 and VRare 2.

97
00:09:20,373 --> 00:09:22,535
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet you have to get it at Fry's, correct?

98
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:30,001
[SPEAKER_11]: V-Rare 1 you got at Toys R Us, actually, with DDR Max, and V-Rare 2 you have to get at Fry's, which is pissing a lot of East Coast people off.

99
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:30,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Because there's no Fry's out there.

100
00:09:30,982 --> 00:09:32,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Because there's no Fry's out there.

101
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:32,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Sucks for them.

102
00:09:32,964 --> 00:09:37,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I know Fry's runs a website at Outpost.com, right?

103
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,360
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the only place you were able to get.

104
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:45,764
[SPEAKER_11]: You remember when Dance Dance Revolution for the PC came out, you could only get it at Fry's, it was a Fry's exclusive.

105
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:48,206
[SPEAKER_11]: We were supposed to care about DDRPC?

106
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:50,388
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, but humor me for a second here.

107
00:09:51,349 --> 00:09:54,591
[SPEAKER_11]: So theoretically, shouldn't you be able to get those samplers at Outpost.com?

108
00:09:55,252 --> 00:10:01,296
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, and I really don't care because I already have that too, and I could just get the VR online somewhere.

109
00:10:01,436 --> 00:10:02,437
[SPEAKER_11]: I would think so, but...

110
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:05,060
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am not a collector, sir.

111
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, Jamie.

112
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:05,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Yo.

113
00:10:28,968 --> 00:10:29,408
[SPEAKER_11]: So what's up?

114
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:30,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fucking tired.

115
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:31,809
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I'm sorry, yeah?

116
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:32,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate people.

117
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,530
[SPEAKER_12]: You hate people?

118
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate people who tailgate me.

119
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate people who go too slow in front of me while people are tailgating me.

120
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:42,433
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hate the stinky old man at my apartment complex.

121
00:10:44,014 --> 00:10:48,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think now might be a good time to get into our favorite game we like to play here at Orange Lounge Radio.

122
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:50,536
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your day and how was your week?

123
00:10:51,536 --> 00:10:54,577
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I think, Jamie, it would be most appropriate if you would start us off tonight.

124
00:10:55,018 --> 00:10:55,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well...

125
00:10:57,162 --> 00:10:58,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting with the week, the week was pretty good.

126
00:11:00,283 --> 00:11:02,744
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, nothing really horrible happened.

127
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:08,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to have somewhat of a date with Stan, which we hardly ever get to spend time together.

128
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:10,187
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty good.

129
00:11:11,828 --> 00:11:12,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Last night was great.

130
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:16,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I drank how much last night?

131
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:17,370
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot.

132
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:27,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Not as much as I usually do when I go drinking, but it was pretty good and I was very happy and spent most of the evening with a pleasant buzz.

133
00:11:32,156 --> 00:11:32,657
[SPEAKER_03]: What did we do?

134
00:11:32,717 --> 00:11:34,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, it was Chubb's birthday.

135
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:36,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Chubb's birthday party was his day.

136
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,243
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was really lots of fun and happy birthday to Chubb's being 21 now.

137
00:11:40,263 --> 00:11:40,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

138
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Played some Pump It Up while someone intoxicated.

139
00:11:47,442 --> 00:11:49,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Played lots of that crappy Wanda Bee Pachinko machine.

140
00:11:50,563 --> 00:11:52,384
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have, like, this blue-spotted dog.

141
00:11:53,945 --> 00:11:56,707
[SPEAKER_03]: And a cup that says Dave and Buster's on it.

142
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:58,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

143
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:07,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, today, though, I'm, you know, in bed, sleeping, because I was up until 5.30 in the morning.

144
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,956
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hear, If you don't get up and help me clean this house...

145
00:12:13,726 --> 00:12:15,047
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to go to your show!

146
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:18,769
[SPEAKER_03]: So I get up and go, excuse me!

147
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,930
[SPEAKER_03]: And then clean the house.

148
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:26,693
[SPEAKER_03]: So I spent practically all of my day cleaning the house.

149
00:12:28,194 --> 00:12:30,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Then had a nice shower, got ready.

150
00:12:32,096 --> 00:12:34,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I stayed at home long enough to turn on the show.

151
00:12:35,878 --> 00:12:38,400
[SPEAKER_03]: And went to the grocery store.

152
00:12:41,335 --> 00:12:47,496
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was in every bit of bad traffic I could possibly imagine, short of there being a wreck.

153
00:12:48,236 --> 00:12:54,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, I wouldn't be here right now had there been a wreck, because I would still be behind all these people, stopping and staring at the wreck.

154
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:55,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

155
00:12:57,418 --> 00:12:59,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, I see a bloody stump!

156
00:13:00,618 --> 00:13:02,179
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an arm.

157
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:04,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, yay.

158
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,020
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you want to see bloody stumps, just go, like, rent a horror movie or something.

159
00:13:13,783 --> 00:13:18,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking about if there had been an accident, people would be stopping and going, oh, can I see a bloody stump?

160
00:13:20,684 --> 00:13:25,285
[SPEAKER_03]: So, at any rate, that's why I was late.

161
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:27,286
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, stupid people.

162
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:30,367
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I'm doing laundry.

163
00:13:30,987 --> 00:13:35,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I had another thing happen during the week, but it's really retarded.

164
00:13:36,568 --> 00:13:36,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

165
00:13:38,624 --> 00:13:40,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I never mind, I'm not going to talk about that because it sucks.

166
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:41,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured as much.

167
00:13:45,547 --> 00:13:46,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I played some PSO.

168
00:13:47,668 --> 00:13:51,069
[SPEAKER_03]: My game froze in the middle of playing PSO, so I lost the two levels I gained.

169
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:55,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of my items that weren't equipped, including my meteor cudgel, which pissed me off.

170
00:13:56,891 --> 00:13:58,232
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm getting them all back.

171
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:00,072
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really about it.

172
00:14:01,213 --> 00:14:03,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy stuff from my vendor in Ragnarok, thank you.

173
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:06,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's move on.

174
00:14:06,615 --> 00:14:06,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Puppy!

175
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,724
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your day and how was your week?

176
00:14:10,904 --> 00:14:19,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, today I'm kind of pissy because I've had too much chemistry work to do.

177
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:26,350
[SPEAKER_10]: I've spent all day writing up lab reports and writing up freaking chemistry things.

178
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:30,832
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to bring my chemistry book with me so I could work on it before the show started.

179
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:53,218
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I had a little adventure at lunch I wanted to go get food before leaving to come to the show So I go down the street to Carl's Jr's I look inside There's like 15 people in line to order And like one person working behind the counter So I'm like, screw this I go over to the subway nearby

180
00:14:54,096 --> 00:14:55,397
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't take ATM cards.

181
00:14:55,778 --> 00:14:59,761
[SPEAKER_10]: I go down to the two grocery stores in the same plaza and neither of them have working ATMs.

182
00:15:00,181 --> 00:15:03,384
[SPEAKER_10]: I drive halfway across town to go to a liquor store that has an ATM.

183
00:15:03,644 --> 00:15:04,305
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not working.

184
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,328
[SPEAKER_10]: I drive back downtown to go get food.

185
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:11,772
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when I finally get back with it, it's, like, not the right thing.

186
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:16,716
[SPEAKER_10]: And I ate it anyways because I was hungry and had meaty thing in almost 24 hours.

187
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:19,999
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, that made me kind of pissy.

188
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:50,728
[SPEAKER_10]: and then the whole stupid driver thing that's like for everybody that drives except for the stupid drivers themselves and then um yeah this week I just did school stuff and then played lots of Initial D because it's like sucking me in oh yes Disgaea too because that's just too cool oh excuse me and I'm done

189
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:55,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Bradley, how was your day and how was your week?

190
00:15:55,973 --> 00:16:01,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, beginning this week I went to a temp agency and then they sent me to an interview for data entry position the next day.

191
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:11,397
[SPEAKER_08]: I did okay on that, but of course as I go on I think of many different ways that I screwed it up.

192
00:16:11,797 --> 00:16:17,239
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was like my first real job interview talking to an actual person in front of them.

193
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:21,740
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like the only other job interview I've ever done was over the phone for an intern thing like

194
00:16:22,424 --> 00:16:32,729
[SPEAKER_08]: I was supposed to find out at the end of Tuesday if he had decided yes or no.

195
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:39,192
[SPEAKER_08]: The person in the agency is supposed to call me back, but she never does.

196
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:44,715
[SPEAKER_08]: I was waiting until the next morning, and I called him and said, what did he decide?

197
00:16:45,215 --> 00:16:51,018
[SPEAKER_08]: He's looking at the resumes and everything, so we have to wait a bit longer.

198
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:58,219
[SPEAKER_08]: and so we'll wait until Thursday, Friday and he hasn't decided by Friday yet so I guess we'll find out next week sometime

199
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:01,815
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I doubt I'll get it, because I didn't do all that great.

200
00:17:02,076 --> 00:17:02,576
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what, though?

201
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:13,064
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been in a very similar position in job hunting, where you're going to, like, 10 pages to 10 pages of your staffing agency, whatever it is, and I swear to God, those people are never really with it.

202
00:17:13,184 --> 00:17:15,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, they never are able to meet their deadlines or whatever.

203
00:17:15,887 --> 00:17:20,410
[SPEAKER_11]: You're just strung along like a stupid puppet, and then finally, just out of the blue, one day it'll hit.

204
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,632
[SPEAKER_11]: So, we'll all cross our fingers for you.

205
00:17:22,832 --> 00:17:23,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

206
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:27,136
[SPEAKER_08]: So, well, I'll have to go look at stuff next week.

207
00:17:27,476 --> 00:17:27,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

208
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:29,019
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the future.

209
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:38,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe try to fake my way to knowing medical terminology, but since I know a little bit, I may be able to fake that somewhere.

210
00:17:39,288 --> 00:17:44,332
[SPEAKER_08]: But, uh, let's see, yesterday didn't do too much, I don't think.

211
00:17:44,412 --> 00:17:49,776
[SPEAKER_08]: And then today, watched some TV, and came over here.

212
00:17:49,796 --> 00:17:52,778
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's basically it for my week.

213
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:56,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

214
00:17:57,222 --> 00:17:57,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

215
00:17:59,386 --> 00:18:02,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright then, let's see, who else wants to talk about their weekend of day?

216
00:18:03,187 --> 00:18:03,967
[SPEAKER_11]: How about VHD?

217
00:18:03,987 --> 00:18:10,428
[SPEAKER_11]: You got a minute away from the kitchen that you can... Well, I know we got Loki, but Loki's doing some stuff there.

218
00:18:10,808 --> 00:18:13,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, then, oh, here comes VHD.

219
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:15,729
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what do you want to know?

220
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,869
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to know, how was your day and how was your week?

221
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:28,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, my week's actually been kind of okay, other than the fact that I had to switch to an 8am class, and I'm still waitlisted for math, I guess I'm cool.

222
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:32,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, by the way, I hate WLD 57 with a passion.

223
00:18:32,882 --> 00:18:33,683
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell is that?

224
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:35,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Workload English.

225
00:18:35,383 --> 00:18:35,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

226
00:18:38,344 --> 00:18:39,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut the hell up, puppy!

227
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:40,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up!

228
00:18:41,845 --> 00:18:43,486
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I hate it with a passion.

229
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:46,347
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have this journal entry we're supposed to write.

230
00:18:46,707 --> 00:18:49,248
[SPEAKER_02]: The beginnings and endings, just anything about it.

231
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:54,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So my topic now is the beginning of Workload 57 and the end of my life.

232
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:57,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is how bad it is.

233
00:18:58,031 --> 00:18:58,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

234
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:05,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I've written on my friend's legal pad, kill me now, please, just kill me now, during English class.

235
00:19:07,491 --> 00:19:07,891
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

236
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:12,932
[SPEAKER_02]: And other than that, been cutting back on initial D, slowly.

237
00:19:13,932 --> 00:19:14,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Good for you!

238
00:19:17,493 --> 00:19:19,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just messing with you.

239
00:19:19,414 --> 00:19:26,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, been kind of studying, extra emphasis on kind of, going out, meeting lots of people.

240
00:19:26,976 --> 00:19:28,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, it's been a pretty okay week.

241
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:32,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, except my mom's always over-emotional every time she comes here.

242
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:34,006
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting kind of irritating.

243
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:38,229
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, gee, mom, I'm not going to die while I'm in Davis, okay?

244
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:39,870
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll miss my baby!

245
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:41,632
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's kind of funny.

246
00:19:41,652 --> 00:19:44,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually thought she didn't like having me around the house.

247
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:48,077
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, like, all of a sudden they move away and now she's like, oh my god.

248
00:19:48,277 --> 00:19:51,600
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't wait to get rid of you until they do and then they miss you like hell.

249
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

250
00:19:52,841 --> 00:19:53,281
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

251
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:54,222
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a pretty good week.

252
00:19:58,906 --> 00:19:59,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

253
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:04,947
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm eating these blue chips so I'm having a hard time talking right now.

254
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Next we'll go to Loki and see how his day and his week was.

255
00:20:09,014 --> 00:20:13,543
[SPEAKER_11]: But first I want to say hello to some new chatters we have in our chat room tonight because we have a lot of new people in the chat room tonight.

256
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:15,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they listening?

257
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:16,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they listening?

258
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,240
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope so.

259
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,001
[SPEAKER_11]: They better be listening because we know.

260
00:20:19,361 --> 00:20:22,884
[SPEAKER_11]: We know and we will find out and you will pay if you're not.

261
00:20:25,046 --> 00:20:27,187
[SPEAKER_11]: www.cali.com Sorry, I don't like it.

[SPEAKER_11]: Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat if you want to join in.

263
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:30,770
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, it's brown and watery.

264
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like these new people, I don't recognize.

265
00:20:32,871 --> 00:20:33,592
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been here before.

266
00:20:33,652 --> 00:20:34,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Greg is Masa.

00:20:48,324 --> 00:20:49,605
[SPEAKER_11]: What a lucky girl.

276
00:20:50,565 --> 00:20:51,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello to everybody.

277
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:54,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Loki, how was your day?

278
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:55,107
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your week?

279
00:20:55,807 --> 00:20:57,027
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't do anything today.

280
00:20:57,688 --> 00:21:01,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Except I started wiring my second pads.

281
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:02,490
[SPEAKER_11]: And those are almost done.

282
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably be done this week.

283
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:07,772
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was playing on the one that is done.

284
00:21:09,012 --> 00:21:11,513
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was pretty cool until the ground wire fell off.

285
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:41,859
[SPEAKER_11]: and that didn't work too well so I had to re-solder that and I didn't do that much I worked a little bit last night up until about 5 in the morning and did some stuff because I rebooted my computer you dumbass and it automatically kicks on right away anyways and then um I don't know that's about it people were gone from my work so I had it pretty easy the last two days just ate sandwiches and um

286
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:43,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Red the Internet.

287
00:21:45,997 --> 00:21:46,357
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool deal.

288
00:21:47,397 --> 00:21:48,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

289
00:21:48,777 --> 00:21:50,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and downloaded more Zim.

290
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:51,958
[SPEAKER_11]: New Zim.

291
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you're the biggest pirate ever.

292
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:54,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Arr.

293
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:55,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Arr.

294
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:58,400
[SPEAKER_11]: We watched a cool video today that I got off the Internet.

295
00:22:01,161 --> 00:22:03,121
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about teaching sex.

296
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:04,641
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get into it in the afterbirth.

297
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:05,402
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

298
00:22:05,422 --> 00:22:07,062
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to make Jamie watch it during the afterbirth.

299
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:07,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

300
00:22:09,603 --> 00:22:10,823
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to go home right after the show?

301
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,930
[SPEAKER_12]: Can't stay for a little bit?

302
00:22:15,311 --> 00:22:15,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

303
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,472
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want to tell!

304
00:22:17,832 --> 00:22:18,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Fine, tell.

305
00:22:18,692 --> 00:22:20,913
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about teaching sex ed to retards.

306
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:23,234
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an instructional video.

307
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:28,276
[SPEAKER_11]: They were called trainers.

308
00:22:28,356 --> 00:22:29,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Trainables.

309
00:22:30,037 --> 00:22:31,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Trainables, whatever.

310
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:32,578
[SPEAKER_11]: I should think.

311
00:22:32,638 --> 00:22:33,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Diapers.

312
00:22:33,378 --> 00:22:33,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Trainables.

313
00:22:34,058 --> 00:22:34,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

314
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:40,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, we'll get into that in the afterbirth, which is after the credits of the program.

315
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,552
[SPEAKER_11]: God, our chat room is such a bunch of moody bitches, I swear.

316
00:22:44,632 --> 00:22:50,617
[SPEAKER_11]: All the people I didn't say hi to, like all of our regulars who've been here weeks and weeks before, they get their FUs read every week and everything.

317
00:22:50,977 --> 00:22:52,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Now they're all, why didn't you say hi to me?

318
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:54,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Why didn't you say hi to me, crybaby?

319
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you don't matter.

320
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,365
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to extend a warm welcome to the new people.

321
00:23:00,405 --> 00:23:02,967
[SPEAKER_11]: The old people should already feel appreciated.

322
00:23:04,248 --> 00:23:04,828
[SPEAKER_11]: We love Orange.

323
00:23:04,908 --> 00:23:09,512
[SPEAKER_11]: I give a general shout out hello to the Orange Lounge chat in general.

324
00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:13,070
[SPEAKER_11]: and I gave Jamie a dollar yesterday.

325
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:16,553
[SPEAKER_03]: And he got to spend a liquor.

326
00:23:18,414 --> 00:23:19,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Bitch, I bought you a drink.

327
00:23:21,576 --> 00:23:22,357
[SPEAKER_03]: You drink half of it.

328
00:23:24,318 --> 00:23:25,098
[SPEAKER_11]: That's neither here nor there.

329
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:30,262
[SPEAKER_11]: So then without further ado, I'll talk about my week and my day because I actually have video game stories to talk about.

330
00:23:30,282 --> 00:23:30,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Shock of shocks.

331
00:23:33,925 --> 00:23:42,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, this week I actually went out and played DDR not once, not twice, but three times.

332
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:44,008
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rob can count.

333
00:23:44,808 --> 00:23:45,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Scary, isn't it?

334
00:23:45,728 --> 00:23:46,588
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what's weird?

335
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:50,569
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is actually working because my pants are like about ready to fall off.

336
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:51,910
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like they're down to here.

337
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,010
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm losing weight.

338
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:54,891
[SPEAKER_09]: This is so exciting.

339
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:57,951
[SPEAKER_11]: My ass is getting smaller with all this DDR I've been playing.

340
00:23:57,991 --> 00:23:58,812
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so happy.

341
00:23:59,752 --> 00:24:00,192
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway...

342
00:24:02,253 --> 00:24:12,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I know, but it's not just that, but it's that I've been playing it more in the past month, and I've been, you know, eating less crap.

343
00:24:12,537 --> 00:24:14,258
[SPEAKER_11]: I still eat crap, but I'm eating less crap.

344
00:24:15,598 --> 00:24:16,199
[SPEAKER_11]: And all that stuff.

345
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,621
[SPEAKER_11]: And now Iron Chef VHG is cooking me dinner.

346
00:24:23,081 --> 00:24:25,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder what I need to bring in next week, then.

347
00:24:26,623 --> 00:24:27,283
[SPEAKER_11]: This is great.

348
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:39,527
[SPEAKER_11]: The women bring food every week and cook for us here on Orange Lounge Radio I got told not to push my luck That's just because I can't cook I will cook one week

349
00:24:41,494 --> 00:24:42,375
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

350
00:25:00,487 --> 00:25:08,189
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of stupid because it's really hard to keep a perspective on where you're at if you're trying to move as well.

351
00:25:08,229 --> 00:25:14,950
[SPEAKER_11]: So most people, the serious players of Playoff Zero at Golf Land, they don't put on the seatbelt so the thing won't rock.

352
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,491
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if you're not wearing your seatbelt, you won't rock.

353
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:22,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Thursday I went and did the same thing and I got another AAA.

354
00:25:22,191 --> 00:25:23,872
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to AAA heavy songs now.

355
00:25:24,632 --> 00:25:25,872
[SPEAKER_11]: I AAA'd Kind Lady.

356
00:25:26,972 --> 00:25:29,333
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you were there.

357
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:31,747
[SPEAKER_11]: AAA Air?

358
00:25:32,348 --> 00:25:32,868
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll work on it.

359
00:25:33,788 --> 00:25:34,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it?

360
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:35,529
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very close.

361
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:36,470
[SPEAKER_11]: What was I really close?

362
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,492
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really close on, like, Butterfly and Let's Get Down, the easy ones.

363
00:25:39,512 --> 00:25:40,392
[SPEAKER_11]: I can get, like, one great.

364
00:25:40,712 --> 00:25:43,794
[SPEAKER_11]: I just haven't yet to... I've yet to get zero greats.

365
00:25:45,275 --> 00:25:46,976
[SPEAKER_11]: What else have I gotten really close on?

366
00:25:46,996 --> 00:25:49,037
[SPEAKER_11]: There was another one I got really, really close on the other day.

367
00:25:51,178 --> 00:25:53,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, I'm really close on Let's Groove as well.

368
00:25:53,739 --> 00:25:54,580
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's something else.

369
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,202
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Do It Right, the purple one, with the purple...

370
00:25:59,014 --> 00:26:01,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Harmonize Two-Step, thank you, I'm really close on that one too.

371
00:26:02,518 --> 00:26:02,718
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

372
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, oh, and 1998.

373
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:10,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, so there's like a lot of these sevens I'm really close on, but I haven't done it yet.

374
00:26:11,255 --> 00:26:12,035
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so close!

375
00:26:12,495 --> 00:26:13,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

376
00:26:14,756 --> 00:26:22,059
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's been that, and Friday I went out there too, but I just played a couple games because I was going to meet somebody more than anything on Friday.

377
00:26:22,739 --> 00:26:31,462
[SPEAKER_11]: And then yesterday was Chubb's birthday party, and I went with DarkSakura to San Jose, and we went to Milpitas Golf Land.

378
00:26:31,482 --> 00:26:36,904
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to play some Horsey Crack, because I haven't played in about three months, so I started a new horse, and her name is Sana.

379
00:26:37,544 --> 00:26:38,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I retired Happy Bunny.

380
00:26:39,025 --> 00:26:40,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you retired Happy Bunny.

381
00:26:40,737 --> 00:26:41,898
[SPEAKER_03]: and Bride of Kiriyamaoka.

382
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:46,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, you made a Kiriyamaoka breed, huh?

383
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:50,905
[SPEAKER_03]: No, my horse and who was the mommy horse?

384
00:26:51,185 --> 00:26:51,966
[SPEAKER_03]: One of Mel's horses.

385
00:26:53,047 --> 00:26:54,808
[SPEAKER_03]: And they birthed a Kiriyamaoka.

386
00:26:54,828 --> 00:26:56,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you get any other rare horses?

387
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have my three.

388
00:26:58,031 --> 00:27:04,836
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw a horsey on the top list, like the number one horse on the list was like a panda, but it was brown.

389
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:05,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was a chocolate panda.

390
00:27:06,898 --> 00:27:07,378
[SPEAKER_03]: That was neat.

391
00:27:07,478 --> 00:27:08,119
[SPEAKER_11]: How exciting.

392
00:27:10,461 --> 00:27:11,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, to go with the chocolate martinis.

393
00:27:13,483 --> 00:27:15,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Then, what else was I thinking?

394
00:27:15,124 --> 00:27:21,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, also, the other cool thing about Derby Owners Club, I've never seen, for some reason, whenever I've been to play, I always get, like, the outdoorsy tracks.

395
00:27:21,988 --> 00:27:26,951
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never seen that track that's Sega, and it's, like, nighttime, and it has Sonic the Hedgehog on it and stuff.

396
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:28,032
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a good track.

397
00:27:28,372 --> 00:27:28,852
[SPEAKER_11]: It's cute.

398
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:29,613
[SPEAKER_11]: I like it.

399
00:27:31,294 --> 00:27:32,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the coolest thing, though, on Horsey Crack.

400
00:27:33,315 --> 00:27:33,475
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

401
00:27:33,495 --> 00:27:33,575
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

402
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:36,596
[SPEAKER_03]: A five horse photo finish.

403
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:38,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, I remember seeing that.

404
00:27:38,638 --> 00:27:39,899
[SPEAKER_11]: The five horse photo finish.

405
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:41,019
[SPEAKER_11]: It's crazy.

406
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:45,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Five horses all finished with the same seconds and like what, thousandth second?

407
00:27:45,462 --> 00:27:46,763
[SPEAKER_11]: They all finished five of them.

408
00:27:46,803 --> 00:27:47,343
[SPEAKER_11]: It was crazy.

409
00:27:48,884 --> 00:27:51,046
[SPEAKER_03]: And three of them were nose and two of them were neck.

410
00:27:52,327 --> 00:27:54,648
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you've never played Horsey Crack before, it's lots of fun.

411
00:27:54,688 --> 00:27:57,250
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you live in SoCal, I hear they're all over SoCal now.

412
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,511
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a couple in NorCal too.

413
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:01,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, VHG, Horsey Crack.

414
00:28:04,843 --> 00:28:23,077
[SPEAKER_11]: and then after Milpitas Golf Land we went over to Dave and Buster's and oh my god oh my god I love Dave and Buster's like I've never had as much fun as I did yesterday because we drank yesterday and this is what I learned about Dave and Buster's I never knew this before call me stupid or whatever but I never knew this before there's little lights above all the machines and if you're sitting in a machine and you're playing and it can be anything

415
00:28:23,357 --> 00:28:23,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

416
00:28:39,122 --> 00:28:40,223
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

417
00:29:04,594 --> 00:29:05,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

418
00:29:34,914 --> 00:29:39,955
[SPEAKER_03]: They had that one, and it's also in the same family of Namco games as Prop Cycle.

419
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:40,616
[SPEAKER_11]: The Prop Cycle.

420
00:29:40,636 --> 00:29:41,316
[SPEAKER_11]: What is it?

421
00:29:41,376 --> 00:29:41,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Kayaking.

422
00:29:41,936 --> 00:29:42,756
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a kayaking game.

423
00:29:42,776 --> 00:29:43,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what you call it?

424
00:29:43,696 --> 00:29:45,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, more like Inflatable Raft.

425
00:29:45,397 --> 00:29:46,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Inflatable Raft.

426
00:29:46,877 --> 00:29:47,477
[SPEAKER_11]: River Rafting.

427
00:29:47,738 --> 00:29:48,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, we'll call it River.

428
00:29:48,378 --> 00:29:49,078
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a River Rafting game.

429
00:29:49,118 --> 00:29:50,458
[SPEAKER_11]: It is so much fun.

430
00:29:50,518 --> 00:29:52,559
[SPEAKER_11]: And Jamie and I kicked ass at it our first time.

431
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:54,059
[SPEAKER_11]: We were on the high score list our first game.

432
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:55,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, number one.

433
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:56,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up, Loki.

434
00:29:58,206 --> 00:30:01,209
[SPEAKER_03]: We ran the whirlpool and everything, and the penguins.

435
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:04,992
[SPEAKER_11]: So DarkSakura and I did a little, yes, there were penguins at the end of the glacial level, so cute.

436
00:30:05,112 --> 00:30:10,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, DarkSakura and I, we played this game and we drank a lot.

437
00:30:10,437 --> 00:30:14,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I didn't really get to drink a lot, though, because I was driving, so I had to be responsible.

438
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,642
[SPEAKER_03]: I was still under my usual.

439
00:30:15,922 --> 00:30:17,063
[SPEAKER_11]: And I had my one martini.

440
00:30:17,844 --> 00:30:22,668
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we played Pump It Up Premiere 3, which I'd never seen before, but they had Premiere 3 of Pump It Up there.

441
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:23,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I played all the old crap.

442
00:30:24,927 --> 00:30:29,052
[SPEAKER_11]: There's only one licensed recognizable song in the whole game.

443
00:30:29,924 --> 00:30:30,544
[SPEAKER_11]: and it's pink.

444
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:31,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Get the party started.

445
00:30:34,387 --> 00:30:39,710
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's really crazy because there's parts... If you play it on crazy mode, like, they ain't fucking with you.

446
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,570
[SPEAKER_11]: It really is crazy.

447
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:46,634
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll be jumping around and, like, you'll have this freeze that are the top two arrows because, you know, Pump It Up is five.

448
00:30:46,714 --> 00:30:47,955
[SPEAKER_11]: It's four corners in the center.

449
00:30:48,235 --> 00:30:53,498
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's like the top two arrows and then you have to hit the middle one with your hand and then the back two with your hand as well.

450
00:30:53,858 --> 00:30:55,939
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is all in the span of about, like, one second.

451
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,540
[SPEAKER_11]: It's crazy.

452
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,543
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a 12-footer.

453
00:30:59,763 --> 00:31:00,284
[SPEAKER_11]: It's sick.

454
00:31:00,964 --> 00:31:09,829
[SPEAKER_11]: So we were watching Chubbs, and people tried to do that, and it was really funny, because Chubbs was really drunk, and he was doing it on the ground and stuff.

455
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,871
[SPEAKER_11]: She was hand-slamming and stuff, and he was like, ow, my hand hurts.

456
00:31:13,151 --> 00:31:14,012
[SPEAKER_11]: It was so funny.

457
00:31:14,512 --> 00:31:15,173
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so funny.

458
00:31:15,493 --> 00:31:17,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny and I were all playing all the Wimpy Easy stuff.

459
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:18,370
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that was cool.

460
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,972
[SPEAKER_11]: I played Conga on hard.

461
00:31:20,372 --> 00:31:20,772
[SPEAKER_11]: It was fun.

462
00:31:21,073 --> 00:31:23,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and then Chubbs is all, hey, can I take your game?

463
00:31:23,695 --> 00:31:24,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I do a song?

464
00:31:24,435 --> 00:31:25,596
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, okay, just don't fail.

465
00:31:25,956 --> 00:31:28,298
[SPEAKER_11]: He failed B in five seconds.

466
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,540
[SPEAKER_11]: I was so mad.

467
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,021
[SPEAKER_11]: That was like two dollars I was out.

468
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:33,843
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Dave and Buster's is expensive.

469
00:31:34,803 --> 00:31:35,844
[SPEAKER_11]: But, good times.

470
00:31:35,944 --> 00:31:37,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise... There was the humongous food court.

471
00:31:39,548 --> 00:31:43,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, at the Great Mall, they had the biggest food court I've ever seen in my life.

472
00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:43,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god.

473
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:49,492
[SPEAKER_11]: They had, like, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, McDonald's, steak.

474
00:31:50,332 --> 00:31:51,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was a rip-off, but it was huge.

475
00:31:54,553 --> 00:31:55,374
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so big.

476
00:31:59,075 --> 00:32:07,618
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh, yeah, we did all that, and then we got home last night at about 2am, and then Loki and I were watching music videos until, uh, late.

477
00:32:08,857 --> 00:32:09,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Which one might I talk about later?

478
00:32:09,817 --> 00:32:10,117
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

479
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:16,039
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I guess we'll take a break.

480
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:19,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless anybody else has something they want to say?

481
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's play some of that VRare 2 stuff tonight.

482
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, let's do that.

483
00:32:22,481 --> 00:32:24,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's play something on VRare 2.

484
00:32:25,282 --> 00:32:34,924
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing... There's nothing new that hasn't been in Japan already, but it's new to the U.S.

485
00:32:35,184 --> 00:32:37,485
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's just some interesting things on it, so why not?

486
00:32:38,154 --> 00:32:38,914
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll give it a spin.

487
00:32:39,215 --> 00:32:39,975
Let's see.

488
00:32:39,995 --> 00:32:44,297
We'll play... I don't play anything that's super long, so... I think that we should go with...

489
00:33:12,372 --> 00:33:15,934
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, looking at this, I'm really not sure what to, because some of these are really long.

490
00:33:16,915 --> 00:33:18,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so I'll just play some of the game edits.

491
00:33:18,256 --> 00:33:21,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the funk disco extended mix of High Lady.

492
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:22,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

493
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:24,880
[SPEAKER_11]: What is that?

494
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,700
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a long one.

495
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,302
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of long, so this will be the only song we play this break.

496
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:32,424
[SPEAKER_11]: When we come back, we will talk about other stuff.

497
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:34,085
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll talk about some Imani news going on.

498
00:33:34,485 --> 00:33:35,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki will give us a sim update.

499
00:33:35,706 --> 00:33:37,007
[SPEAKER_11]: And later tonight, by the way...

500
00:33:39,105 --> 00:33:41,147
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to ruin it if it's your cage match pick.

501
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:43,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh no, you're picking, you told me you're doing the paranoia thing, right?

502
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:44,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight?

503
00:33:46,452 --> 00:33:48,854
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have a new Loki remix to debut tonight, yes?

504
00:33:49,514 --> 00:33:52,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, so we have a new Loki remix to debut a little later on in the program.

505
00:33:53,538 --> 00:33:57,321
[SPEAKER_11]: So, enjoy this from the DDR Max 2 VRare.

506
00:33:57,341 --> 00:34:00,224
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Kind Lady, the funky disco extended mix, and we'll be back.

507
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,123
and many more.

508
00:35:31,946 --> 00:35:44,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give the love you need till you hover in obscurity I'm like a restaurant, I'm a great lady You can hurt me, but I am the cure And when you wake up late thinking it's a dream Just touch me, boy, you know you can count on me Believe me!

509
00:35:44,536 --> 00:35:48,999
It's late, it's late, you know what you found in me It's a late, it's kinda late, and you

00:36:03,336 --> 00:36:04,204

Thank you for watching!

513
00:41:30,165 --> 00:41:36,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

514
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:41,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome back.

515
00:41:41,672 --> 00:41:48,696
[SPEAKER_11]: We hope you enjoyed that kind lady funk disco extended mix, all seven minutes of it, from the USA V-Rare 2 soundtrack.

516
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:49,919
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Ranma S

517
00:42:12,694 --> 00:42:19,358
[SPEAKER_11]: DDR Max, it says, Dance Dance Revolution game features over 70 songs and 100 plus minutes of authentic dance music.

518
00:42:19,738 --> 00:42:29,803
[SPEAKER_11]: And then DDR Max 2 says, the DDR Max 2 Dance Dance Revolution game features over 65 songs and 100 minutes, exactly, of authentic dance music.

519
00:42:30,664 --> 00:42:30,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Eww.

520
00:42:30,744 --> 00:42:32,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's not cooked yet.

521
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:34,045
I need to marinate it, though.

522
00:42:34,345 --> 00:42:34,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

523
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:36,927
Eww, you ungrateful veggie cookie.

524
00:42:36,947 --> 00:42:38,868
You've been here and you're going, eww.

525
00:42:39,368 --> 00:42:40,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it looks ewwy.

526
00:42:42,758 --> 00:42:44,660
[SPEAKER_11]: There's conversations going on here without a microphone.

527
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:46,501
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

528
00:42:48,463 --> 00:42:50,964
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a big rule that I try to remember.

529
00:42:50,984 --> 00:42:52,245
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called never think while you eat.

530
00:42:54,967 --> 00:42:57,649
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just take a picture of it and put it in front of you while you're eating dinner.

531
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Fun.

532
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we'll remind you of your ew.

533
00:43:02,473 --> 00:43:03,494
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll look better when it's cooked.

534
00:43:03,534 --> 00:43:03,894
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it will.

535
00:43:05,835 --> 00:43:09,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Then when you look on the side, it says in really, really tiny print,

536
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:12,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Warning, all rights reserved.

537
00:43:12,806 --> 00:43:15,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Unauthorized duplication is a violation of applicable laws.

538
00:43:16,629 --> 00:43:17,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Printed in the USA.

539
00:43:17,669 --> 00:43:19,811
[SPEAKER_11]: V-Rare Soundtrack USA.

540
00:43:19,971 --> 00:43:21,832
[SPEAKER_11]: And in the Max 2, it says V-Rare Soundtrack 2.

541
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:27,496
[SPEAKER_11]: So, it's kind of like, it's in really, really tiny print, but it's kind of a nod to the Japanese V-Rare ones.

542
00:43:28,336 --> 00:43:28,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Very.

543
00:43:29,397 --> 00:43:29,897
[SPEAKER_11]: V, very rare.

544
00:43:29,917 --> 00:43:30,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Very rare.

545
00:43:30,998 --> 00:43:32,059
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very rare.

546
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,581
[SPEAKER_03]: If it were meat, it would still be mooing.

547
00:43:36,642 --> 00:43:38,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, for the record, Max 2 has 69 songs in it.

548
00:43:40,538 --> 00:43:41,338
[SPEAKER_11]: What a nice number.

549
00:43:41,998 --> 00:43:43,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Not quite 70, but 69.

550
00:43:43,779 --> 00:43:45,059
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think Max1 had like 71.

551
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:51,060
[SPEAKER_11]: So... So yay.

552
00:43:55,361 --> 00:43:56,721
[SPEAKER_11]: What else can I tell you about what's going on?

553
00:43:56,741 --> 00:43:58,782
[SPEAKER_11]: What's going on in Bomani News this week?

554
00:43:58,942 --> 00:44:00,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody hear any interesting things?

555
00:44:01,062 --> 00:44:01,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Loki.

556
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,263
[SPEAKER_11]: I know some things, and if you don't mention them, I will.

557
00:44:07,506 --> 00:44:08,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Loki.

558
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:11,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, a bunch of shit's gone down this week.

559
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:16,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, starting with, um, first off, more details about DDR Extreme.

560
00:44:17,575 --> 00:44:20,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, it being that it's very similar to Max 2.

561
00:44:20,397 --> 00:44:21,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, surprise.

562
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:22,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Surprise?

563
00:44:26,983 --> 00:44:29,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, anyways, um, let's see.

564
00:44:30,286 --> 00:44:31,787
[SPEAKER_11]: There's gonna be dancing characters.

565
00:44:31,887 --> 00:44:32,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, surprise.

566
00:44:33,288 --> 00:44:34,369
[SPEAKER_11]: I know everyone's surprised.

567
00:44:34,749 --> 00:44:34,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

568
00:44:35,916 --> 00:44:38,897
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we announced last week's A Stupid Barber was going to be in there.

569
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:40,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

570
00:44:40,058 --> 00:44:40,538
[SPEAKER_11]: That type of shit.

571
00:44:40,758 --> 00:44:44,339
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm trying to think, what else?

572
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:52,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing really else as far as, you know... Did we announce the other songs that were going to be in it?

573
00:44:52,242 --> 00:44:53,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we probably did, didn't we?

574
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:54,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably.

575
00:44:55,243 --> 00:44:56,824
[SPEAKER_11]: That's no big deal, though.

576
00:44:57,684 --> 00:44:59,325
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, not too much going on with DDR Extreme.

577
00:44:59,345 --> 00:45:03,927
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not going to release too much more information because obviously it's coming out in a couple weeks, so, you know...

578
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:09,048
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't honestly think there's going to be too much more unlocked in that game than what they have.

579
00:45:09,068 --> 00:45:10,388
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll probably be A Stupid Barber.

580
00:45:10,448 --> 00:45:11,048
[SPEAKER_11]: And guess what?

581
00:45:11,908 --> 00:45:16,769
[SPEAKER_11]: I found out today that Forever Sunshine is going to be Forever Ours in the U.S.

582
00:45:17,309 --> 00:45:24,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, that piece of shit, Forever Sunshine, is going to be pretty much replacing Let Them Move in the U.S.

583
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:27,891
[SPEAKER_11]: as the piece of shit track that they get to put on every single release.

584
00:45:28,111 --> 00:45:28,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, wait a minute.

585
00:45:28,891 --> 00:45:33,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Last week we did have that vote, and Let Them Move is still considered the worst of the two songs.

586
00:45:35,003 --> 00:45:42,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, okay, so basically what you're saying is instead of, like, Carrot Top, I have, um, I don't know, um... Charro.

587
00:45:43,489 --> 00:45:45,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I have that.

588
00:45:45,971 --> 00:45:53,297
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they're both bad, but, you know, it'll still wear on you, but anyways...

589
00:45:54,073 --> 00:45:55,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Enough with DDR Extreme, nothing going on there.

590
00:45:56,254 --> 00:46:00,516
[SPEAKER_11]: The big news was in Dance Dance Revolution Party Collection, which they announced the new tracks.

591
00:46:00,596 --> 00:46:05,279
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is what's coming out after Extreme, and there's more news coming out on this mix than there is on the other one.

592
00:46:05,899 --> 00:46:08,080
[SPEAKER_11]: First off, let's start with the new exclusive songs.

593
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, some of them exclusive, but anyways.

594
00:46:10,541 --> 00:46:14,123
[SPEAKER_11]: We have Freedom, the new B4U track, which no one gets to rat's ass about.

595
00:46:14,704 --> 00:46:17,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Wannabe by the Spice Girls, which is also going to be in Dancing Stage.

596
00:46:17,565 --> 00:46:18,926
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a rant about that when you're done.

597
00:46:20,267 --> 00:46:28,532
[SPEAKER_11]: Try to Love You, which was also in Max 2 USA, Stars, which was in Poppin' Music, Stars in Second Naoki Style, whatever that means.

598
00:46:29,092 --> 00:46:30,153
[SPEAKER_11]: We might have that somewhere.

599
00:46:30,453 --> 00:46:31,753
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to look for that, see if we have it.

600
00:46:32,594 --> 00:46:44,221
[SPEAKER_11]: I need you, the Inside Out Door Mix, which is a remix of I Need You from Max 2 USA, and then a new Paranoia remix called Paranoia Respect by 0.3K.

601
00:46:44,561 --> 00:46:46,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Just What the World Needs, another Paranoia mix.

602
00:46:46,282 --> 00:46:48,544
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is probably going to be a 300 BPM Paranoia.

603
00:46:49,484 --> 00:46:54,146
[SPEAKER_11]: and they announced a few more licensed tracks in here.

604
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:58,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, I didn't know which ones were new than what we had last time.

605
00:46:58,988 --> 00:47:03,150
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the ones I remember is Music, which is from 4th Mix.

606
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:05,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I love that song!

607
00:47:06,213 --> 00:47:11,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, Ecstasy from 5th Mix, of course, um, Overblast was another one.

608
00:47:11,894 --> 00:47:15,175
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like it's a pretty decent collection of, like, songs in there.

609
00:47:15,775 --> 00:47:18,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, Moonlight Shadow, you know, Missing Heart, um, is pretty good.

610
00:47:19,276 --> 00:47:23,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus, this game has selectable characters, and you earn the characters as you go along in it.

611
00:47:24,097 --> 00:47:30,479
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's another thing about DDR Extreme, is you earn the characters as you go along, not all at one time unlocked, like in Max 2 USA.

612
00:47:32,235 --> 00:47:34,837
[SPEAKER_11]: The selection screen for the characters is actually pretty cool.

613
00:47:34,857 --> 00:47:39,640
[SPEAKER_11]: They had a video that was on IGN that people grabbed shots from that are pretty cool.

614
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:42,081
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what it reminded me of, that character selection screen?

615
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:44,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you guys ever played one of those bootleg Nintendo carts?

616
00:47:44,823 --> 00:47:50,986
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like Mortal Kombat with 64 characters, and they have all these little tiny pictures just all lined up in a big table.

617
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:56,930
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it reminded me of, the character selection screen, because there's so many characters in this party collection.

618
00:48:00,955 --> 00:48:01,739
[SPEAKER_11]: anyways uh...

619
00:48:03,157 --> 00:48:05,098
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's pretty much all that's going on there.

620
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:08,339
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, it's going to be a reskinned Extreme engine.

621
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I bitch for a minute about something?

622
00:48:11,661 --> 00:48:11,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

623
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:17,163
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to know why in the hell we're only getting one new Dance Mania license on this whole thing.

624
00:48:17,503 --> 00:48:19,444
[SPEAKER_11]: That license being Wannabe by the Spice Girls.

625
00:48:19,544 --> 00:48:23,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Without the obvious that it was on the Euromix, so we're getting it too.

626
00:48:23,966 --> 00:48:29,449
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, because, you know, there's a hundred songs I could bring over from one of the USAs or Euromixes just because we got it.

627
00:48:29,909 --> 00:48:31,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Wannabe by the Spice Girls was on...

628
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:33,952
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it was Zipmania Best.

629
00:48:33,972 --> 00:48:38,237
[SPEAKER_11]: It was on one of the Dance Mania albums.

630
00:48:38,317 --> 00:48:39,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Dance Mania Diamond.

631
00:48:39,238 --> 00:48:40,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Easy.

632
00:48:40,479 --> 00:48:43,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Why waste any more effort on a compilation?

633
00:48:44,246 --> 00:48:45,787
[SPEAKER_11]: But why just one?

634
00:48:45,867 --> 00:48:48,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you'll buy it just the same.

635
00:48:48,309 --> 00:48:49,990
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I won't.

636
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:51,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Not because of that song.

637
00:48:51,671 --> 00:48:53,833
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the Spice Girls are so five years ago.

638
00:48:53,853 --> 00:48:56,114
[SPEAKER_11]: If this was five years ago, fuck yeah, I would have eaten that shit up.

639
00:48:56,414 --> 00:48:58,836
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is five years later and everybody knows the Spice Girls are lame.

640
00:48:58,856 --> 00:49:01,818
[SPEAKER_11]: But Japan isn't exactly on top of modern culture in the US.

641
00:49:01,898 --> 00:49:02,719
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand that.

642
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:05,801
[SPEAKER_11]: For them, the Spice Girls are like, whoa, that's so cutting edge.

643
00:49:09,008 --> 00:49:11,429
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand that, but why just one?

644
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:13,189
[SPEAKER_11]: I would rather they do none.

645
00:49:13,269 --> 00:49:18,210
[SPEAKER_11]: If you looked at DDR best hits, there was nothing new about it.

646
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:21,651
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just clear-cut best tracks.

647
00:49:22,491 --> 00:49:25,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Why give us these new tracks when they fucking suck?

648
00:49:25,452 --> 00:49:26,652
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

649
00:49:27,112 --> 00:49:28,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I don't know about these Konami originals.

650
00:49:28,692 --> 00:49:29,232
[SPEAKER_11]: They may be good.

651
00:49:29,452 --> 00:49:37,354
[SPEAKER_11]: When I talk about Dance Mania licenses, either you're going to take the effort to give us a lot of new Dance Mania stuff, which would be nice and very well appreciated, trust me, and prove that DDR is not dead yet.

652
00:49:38,457 --> 00:49:40,882
[SPEAKER_11]: or you can give us crap.

653
00:49:41,904 --> 00:49:43,187
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what we're getting, is crap.

654
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:48,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, aside from home versions, there was a little bit of arcade news this week.

655
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:51,183
[SPEAKER_11]: First being DDR Extreme.

656
00:49:52,924 --> 00:49:56,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone remembers back to when they were first releasing DDR Extreme.

657
00:49:56,507 --> 00:49:58,048
[SPEAKER_11]: It was beta testing and all that stuff.

658
00:49:58,388 --> 00:50:02,110
[SPEAKER_11]: How there were some onis for some of the older songs.

659
00:50:02,271 --> 00:50:04,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Just kind of like Little Bitch had some onis and stuff.

660
00:50:04,492 --> 00:50:07,774
[SPEAKER_11]: But there was one step chart that was going around forever that people were like...

661
00:50:08,945 --> 00:50:10,246
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't find this in the game.

662
00:50:10,346 --> 00:50:11,707
[SPEAKER_11]: This has got to be fake.

663
00:50:11,727 --> 00:50:13,928
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it was the damn Darium Oni steps.

664
00:50:13,988 --> 00:50:18,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, come to find out, they were actually going to be in there, but they just cut them out at the last minute.

665
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:25,335
[SPEAKER_11]: But thanks to the wonderful programming at Konami of Japan and their, you know, very buggy DDR Extreme,

666
00:50:25,715 --> 00:50:29,279
[SPEAKER_11]: You too can play these wonderful step charts that never made it in.

667
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:35,326
[SPEAKER_11]: And don't tell me Xtreme does not feel rushed to any of you, because Xtreme is the most buggy of any DDR game they've released yet.

668
00:50:35,746 --> 00:50:36,907
[SPEAKER_11]: 1998 just froze on me Thursday.

669
00:50:36,947 --> 00:50:39,210
[SPEAKER_11]: I played it first song, and it fucking freezes on me.

670
00:50:40,111 --> 00:50:44,976
[SPEAKER_11]: But the neat thing is, the arrows scroll by really fast to catch up, and you can still hit them if you're fast enough.

671
00:50:45,377 --> 00:50:46,318
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of challenging, but...

672
00:50:47,071 --> 00:50:47,752
[SPEAKER_12]: Also pisses you off.

673
00:50:47,832 --> 00:50:50,294
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyways, what you do is you do the Oni trick.

674
00:50:50,374 --> 00:51:02,765
[SPEAKER_11]: For those who are not familiar with the Oni trick, you have to go to an Oni selection screen or non-sub selection screen, and you kind of switch back and forth until you switch, I believe it's just above where you're looking for.

675
00:51:03,166 --> 00:51:05,788
[SPEAKER_11]: So say, for instance, you want to play Damn Darien with the Oni steps.

676
00:51:06,248 --> 00:51:09,631
[SPEAKER_11]: You pick a song, say, and what they've been doing is like the player's best.

677
00:51:09,972 --> 00:51:13,235
[SPEAKER_11]: So say Damn Darien is like number six in player's best.

678
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:22,503
[SPEAKER_11]: So what you need is you need to get an Oni, a song with just Oni steps, so basically one of the Oni remixes, in number two, because, you know, they're going to match up.

679
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:32,572
[SPEAKER_11]: So what you're going to do is you put it in there, and you switch real fast, and then when Damdarium comes up, it's going to have Oni steps on it, because you switched it really fast, and DDR Extreme is just really cool.

680
00:51:33,052 --> 00:51:39,838
[SPEAKER_11]: To kind of reiterate that point for those that might not be getting it, if you ever notice when you're switching around in the difficulties section,

681
00:51:40,058 --> 00:52:04,674
[SPEAKER_11]: for just a minute when you're spinning that wheel on the Oni courses if you're on something, let's say you're on an Oni course that has all heavy songs for just like a split second when you switch over to the one beneath it that might be a bunch of trick songs for like a split second those trick songs will be listed in green like it does that thing where it's collapsed and then it expands well like right as it expands it'll still be in that green color before it switches and that's the trick they're exploiting here

682
00:52:05,342 --> 00:52:11,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, the new Oni steps, they've got Damodarium Singles and Doubles, which are okay.

683
00:52:11,285 --> 00:52:16,247
[SPEAKER_11]: They've got one for, what was it, Love Love Shine, that's new single Oni.

684
00:52:16,347 --> 00:52:20,449
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they have one that's just retarded for Blue Impulse.

685
00:52:24,223 --> 00:52:27,646
[SPEAKER_11]: All it is is completely blank and one freezer at the very end.

686
00:52:27,906 --> 00:52:31,789
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like one of my edits that I did to kick the can years ago called Big Cans.

687
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:35,933
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one arrow at the end of the whole thing.

688
00:52:37,054 --> 00:52:46,882
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one where Rick and Timmy Nepal got off the machine and ran circles around Golf Land and then came back and hit the last step.

689
00:52:48,027 --> 00:52:57,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, that was my edit to Big Cans, which I never did finish Big Cans will always be only half the song I never finished it It's gone, I think I deleted it Do you really?

690
00:52:59,598 --> 00:53:02,081
[SPEAKER_03]: I found one of my old missing memory cards that has my edits on it

691
00:53:04,474 --> 00:53:06,555
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm making a new Legend of Max edit, but um...

692
00:53:29,777 --> 00:53:38,380
[SPEAKER_11]: A new thing I was going to mention also, the last of the news, is there was a nice little bootleg upgrade on eBay recently.

693
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:43,862
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Dance Dance Revolution Megamix, which included all the songs from 4th, 5th, and Extreme.

694
00:53:44,402 --> 00:53:49,103
[SPEAKER_11]: A nice little bootleg package there, which is actually still up for auction right now.

695
00:53:49,964 --> 00:53:53,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Or it says, seller ended the listing early because of the error in the listing.

696
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:55,866
[SPEAKER_11]: The item has been relisted.

697
00:53:56,326 --> 00:53:57,106
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see what they say.

698
00:53:58,783 --> 00:54:09,546
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you reading here?

699
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:11,246
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just reading the auction.

700
00:54:11,286 --> 00:54:16,827
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, this auction is for the 9th Dance Dance Revolution upgrade kit named Mega Mix.

701
00:54:16,867 --> 00:54:22,068
[SPEAKER_11]: This upgrade includes all the songs from 8th, 5th Mix, and 4th Mix games.

702
00:54:22,108 --> 00:54:24,609
[SPEAKER_11]: The kit includes Marquee, which looks like a piece of shit.

703
00:54:25,409 --> 00:54:25,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

704
00:54:26,457 --> 00:54:32,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Upgrade instructions and software and hardware components to upgrade your third mix and higher DDR2 player machine.

705
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:36,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki will link this eBay auction in the chatroom for all of you.

706
00:54:36,826 --> 00:54:39,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it is just a piece of shit.

707
00:54:39,848 --> 00:54:46,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I noticed that you had posted about this over on Aaron in Japan, and they were all kind of going, obviously this isn't an official Konami release.

708
00:54:46,314 --> 00:54:48,295
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I did not post it on Aaron in Japan.

709
00:54:48,496 --> 00:54:50,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, they had already had it posted in there.

710
00:54:50,517 --> 00:54:51,879
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw it actually earlier in the week.

711
00:54:51,899 --> 00:54:52,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, sorry.

712
00:54:52,759 --> 00:54:54,401
[SPEAKER_11]: And people started noticing it, but...

713
00:54:58,392 --> 00:55:05,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Duh, obviously it's a bootleg, but the most curious thing about this is whether it legitimately is 8th, 5th, and 4th or not.

714
00:55:05,976 --> 00:55:08,517
[SPEAKER_11]: I am knocking my shit over!

715
00:55:08,577 --> 00:55:09,578
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you doing?

716
00:55:10,198 --> 00:55:10,958
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you doing?

717
00:55:11,619 --> 00:55:12,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are my post-its!

718
00:55:12,959 --> 00:55:13,780
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

719
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:15,481
[SPEAKER_11]: What the hell?

720
00:55:15,841 --> 00:55:18,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Shit, they have got information on them.

721
00:55:18,202 --> 00:55:19,683
[SPEAKER_11]: It's important information.

722
00:55:22,404 --> 00:55:23,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Gosh.

723
00:55:23,645 --> 00:55:23,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

724
00:55:23,825 --> 00:55:23,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

725
00:55:26,721 --> 00:55:27,661
[SPEAKER_11]: I like being overdramatic.

726
00:55:27,922 --> 00:55:36,866
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but anyways, no, it's a legit hack in the game, so it does have all the songs that it claims it has, it's just that no one spent time to create a marquee.

727
00:55:38,387 --> 00:55:42,909
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't believe that the guy is telling you that all the songs are in there, but I will not believe it until I see a video of it.

728
00:55:43,229 --> 00:55:43,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Period.

729
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:45,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

730
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:48,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I just, it doesn't make sense.

731
00:55:48,472 --> 00:55:51,673
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't, because how do all those songs fit on a CD?

732
00:55:52,013 --> 00:55:54,214
[SPEAKER_11]: There's got to be some kind of switch or something.

733
00:55:54,234 --> 00:55:55,175
[SPEAKER_11]: They're doing something...

734
00:55:56,104 --> 00:55:59,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Either it's fake or there's something really low tech about it.

735
00:56:00,046 --> 00:56:00,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Easy!

736
00:56:01,007 --> 00:56:02,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Easy, you take out the videos.

737
00:56:04,609 --> 00:56:06,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so that's a possibility, but that's just what I want to know.

738
00:56:07,351 --> 00:56:08,472
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to know more about it.

739
00:56:08,752 --> 00:56:10,413
[SPEAKER_11]: It don't take up that much space.

740
00:56:10,593 --> 00:56:12,314
[SPEAKER_11]: It really is not that hard to do that.

741
00:56:14,015 --> 00:56:14,195
[SPEAKER_11]: Well.

742
00:56:15,516 --> 00:56:16,277
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm being a stubborn bastard.

743
00:56:16,297 --> 00:56:17,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it really only a dollar right now?

744
00:56:17,558 --> 00:56:18,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I should place a bid.

745
00:56:18,258 --> 00:56:19,819
[SPEAKER_11]: The reserve isn't met on that.

746
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:22,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, the reserve price is going to be over $1,500.

747
00:56:22,401 --> 00:56:23,001
[SPEAKER_11]: I could bid $69 on it.

748
00:56:23,021 --> 00:56:23,862
[SPEAKER_11]: You could, but you won't win.

749
00:56:46,443 --> 00:56:47,886
[SPEAKER_11]: I said that he should give it to me for free.

750
00:56:47,906 --> 00:56:50,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I would laugh at whoever was stupid enough to bid on that.

751
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually there were four bids last time.

752
00:56:53,752 --> 00:56:53,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

753
00:56:54,152 --> 00:56:55,334
[SPEAKER_11]: I get it.

754
00:56:55,614 --> 00:56:56,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, think about this.

755
00:56:56,695 --> 00:56:57,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Think about this.

756
00:56:57,416 --> 00:56:58,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Say you got it.

757
00:56:58,117 --> 00:56:58,957
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a bootleg machine.

758
00:56:58,977 --> 00:57:00,119
[SPEAKER_11]: You know that from the get-go.

759
00:57:00,139 --> 00:57:03,122
[SPEAKER_11]: You already have a bootleg machine that's not making any more money for you right now.

760
00:57:03,382 --> 00:57:05,544
[SPEAKER_11]: So what you do, you get a nice upgrade bootleg machine.

761
00:57:05,584 --> 00:57:07,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, since all of them are illegal over here anyways.

762
00:57:08,287 --> 00:57:12,892
[SPEAKER_11]: And you take that and you put it in your arcade next to your DDR Extreme, which is still making some money.

763
00:57:13,332 --> 00:57:14,734
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you make a new marquee for it.

764
00:57:14,874 --> 00:57:15,715
[SPEAKER_11]: And whoa, there you go.

765
00:57:15,735 --> 00:57:16,896
[SPEAKER_03]: You're assuming this thing works?

766
00:57:18,873 --> 00:57:20,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't waste my money on anything.

767
00:57:20,654 --> 00:57:25,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, all the bootlegs for Max 2 and DDR Extreme work, why would this be any different?

768
00:57:26,096 --> 00:57:31,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they're bootlegs in the sense that they are copies of Konami official things.

769
00:57:32,158 --> 00:57:33,479
[SPEAKER_10]: No, they are hacked hardware.

770
00:57:33,499 --> 00:57:37,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody went in there and not only hacked the hardware, but hacked the programming.

771
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,281
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is that a problem?

772
00:57:40,321 --> 00:57:42,182
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't believe it until I see a video.

773
00:57:42,222 --> 00:57:43,042
[SPEAKER_11]: What are they showing here?

774
00:57:43,262 --> 00:57:46,103
[SPEAKER_11]: They're showing a shoddy marquee.

775
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:51,159
[SPEAKER_11]: and they're not showing any in-game shots, anything about the game itself.

776
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:57,862
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all going off just what this guy says, which, you know, okay, maybe it's right, you know, but I just, I don't get it.

777
00:57:57,942 --> 00:57:58,502
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't make sense.

778
00:57:58,542 --> 00:58:00,562
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to know more about how this is actually operating.

779
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it really all in one mix?

780
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:07,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it like one of those Taiwan 64-in-1 games where you pick one of the games before you start the game?

781
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:08,985
[SPEAKER_11]: What is this about?

782
00:58:09,425 --> 00:58:11,246
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know enough about it and I would never spend $1,500 on it.

783
00:58:11,266 --> 00:58:11,526
[SPEAKER_11]: I would.

784
00:58:11,686 --> 00:58:12,226
[SPEAKER_11]: I would.

785
00:58:12,266 --> 00:58:13,386
[SPEAKER_11]: You're crazy.

786
00:58:13,486 --> 00:58:15,147
[SPEAKER_11]: If I had extra money, I'd definitely buy it.

787
00:58:18,817 --> 00:58:19,417
[SPEAKER_11]: You're very crazy.

788
00:58:19,437 --> 00:58:21,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, alright, so there's that.

789
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:23,239
[SPEAKER_11]: It smells like burning in here.

790
00:58:23,699 --> 00:58:25,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it smells like burning because VHG's cooking.

791
00:58:26,881 --> 00:58:27,021
Hey!

792
00:58:27,261 --> 00:58:28,241
You know what?

793
00:58:28,822 --> 00:58:29,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like beer.

794
00:58:30,362 --> 00:58:31,063
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you don't like beer.

795
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:34,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, you can drink all my Coronas and stuff that I've got in there because I bought those home for free.

796
00:58:34,705 --> 00:58:37,566
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I already told her she could have one.

797
00:58:37,586 --> 00:58:40,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Except I sort of like Corona because it doesn't taste like American beer.

798
00:58:40,647 --> 00:58:41,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone drink the pale ale.

799
00:58:42,468 --> 00:58:42,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously.

800
00:58:42,748 --> 00:58:43,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take them home.

801
00:58:43,769 --> 00:58:43,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

802
00:58:46,716 --> 00:58:50,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, um, I think what we will do is we'll take another quick break.

803
00:58:51,282 --> 00:58:52,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I play something?

804
00:58:52,663 --> 00:58:53,244
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you want to play?

805
00:58:53,284 --> 00:58:54,565
[SPEAKER_11]: We should play that Paranoia remix.

806
00:58:54,585 --> 00:58:55,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to do your new mix?

807
00:58:55,867 --> 00:58:59,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, that's right, I was gonna, well, hmm.

808
00:58:59,671 --> 00:59:01,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, it's a game, it's a game, yeah.

809
00:59:01,974 --> 00:59:03,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

810
00:59:03,655 --> 00:59:04,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Talk about your new remix, Loki.

811
00:59:05,557 --> 00:59:16,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, earlier this week, we downloaded illegally off the internet because we watched the video about the bad things about piracy and how it hurts the record industry.

812
00:59:16,204 --> 00:59:16,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

813
00:59:16,604 --> 00:59:21,367
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we said we don't care, so we went ahead and downloaded it anyways, since it sucked.

814
00:59:21,628 --> 00:59:26,811
[SPEAKER_11]: And we downloaded the brand new album for Enigma, Enigma 5, which...

815
00:59:28,448 --> 00:59:29,829
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it's called Voyager.

816
00:59:29,969 --> 00:59:31,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Enigma, great band.

817
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:34,472
[SPEAKER_11]: I love some of their stuff, like the Cross of Changes was an awesome album.

818
00:59:34,752 --> 00:59:37,134
[SPEAKER_11]: This new album, Voyager, fucking blows.

819
00:59:37,314 --> 00:59:39,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, don't you want to cue it up?

820
00:59:39,335 --> 00:59:39,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I do.

821
00:59:39,916 --> 00:59:40,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

822
00:59:40,696 --> 00:59:43,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, there's a song on there called Boom Boom, which is kind of neat.

823
00:59:44,158 --> 00:59:47,520
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I mixed that with Echoes from 9th Style.

824
00:59:48,661 --> 00:59:54,145
[SPEAKER_11]: I got no boom boom echoed in my head remix.

825
00:59:54,446 --> 00:59:57,568
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is going to be interesting because a lot of you guys may not have heard Echoes before.

826
00:59:57,608 --> 01:00:02,031
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of one of the lesser known songs from Night Style, but it's got a pretty cool backbeat to it.

827
01:00:02,232 --> 01:00:06,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and I just totally mixed it around, and that's actually pretty decent for a mix.

828
01:00:06,715 --> 01:00:09,597
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't hurried along at all, so it turned out pretty well.

829
01:00:09,737 --> 01:00:13,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so here it is, the world premiere here on Orange Lounge Radio of Loki's latest remix.

830
01:00:14,853 --> 01:00:17,794
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Boom Boom, the Echoed in My Head remix.

831
01:00:18,154 --> 01:00:20,095
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's Enigma vs. Dragoon.

832
01:00:20,315 --> 01:00:21,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Enigma vs. Dragoon.

833
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:21,955
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be back.

834
01:03:00,948 --> 01:03:05,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that was a world premiere of Boom Boom, originally by Enigma, but remixed right there by Loki.

835
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:09,471
[SPEAKER_11]: The Echoed in My Head remix, so it had a little bit of echoes from Nightstyle in there.

836
01:03:09,571 --> 01:03:10,291
[SPEAKER_11]: So, what'd you guys think?

837
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:11,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Boomy.

838
01:03:15,713 --> 01:03:22,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Your chair attracts more microphone cord than, like, a pimp attracts hose.

839
01:03:22,635 --> 01:03:23,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you go.

840
01:03:23,795 --> 01:03:24,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, what'd you think of it, Bradley?

841
01:03:24,976 --> 01:03:25,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounded pretty cool.

842
01:03:25,876 --> 01:03:27,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I liked it.

843
01:03:27,337 --> 01:03:28,437
[SPEAKER_11]: He definitely made that album better.

844
01:03:30,148 --> 01:03:31,469
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

845
01:03:51,499 --> 01:03:51,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically.

846
01:03:52,259 --> 01:04:00,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, I will say the fourth album has my favorite Enigma song ever on it, Gravity of Love, which has a cool video on it, as Loki saw last night.

847
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,864
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, Gravity of Love, good Enigma song.

848
01:04:07,564 --> 01:04:09,805
[SPEAKER_11]: The entire Voyager album, bad Enigma song.

849
01:04:09,985 --> 01:04:11,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the video like watching a Bjork video?

850
01:04:12,565 --> 01:04:15,146
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not quite that fucked, but it's like Eyes Wide Shut.

851
01:04:16,106 --> 01:04:16,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen that movie.

852
01:04:17,527 --> 01:04:18,047
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty cool.

853
01:04:20,488 --> 01:04:20,868
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

854
01:04:22,506 --> 01:04:33,430
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so that was the Boom Boom Boom, uh, not Boom, sorry, not Boom Boom Boom, that's a Vengaboys song, that was Boom Boom, the, uh, Loki, you should mix Boom Boom with Boom Boom Boom.

855
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:39,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, that song that I wanted you to mix, I played it for Rob yesterday, Dutch Glockenspiel.

856
01:04:39,151 --> 01:04:39,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.

857
01:04:40,012 --> 01:04:41,672
[SPEAKER_03]: And I left the CD at home.

858
01:04:42,913 --> 01:04:43,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Eh.

859
01:04:44,355 --> 01:04:46,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, we're going to break with some Bomani songs.

860
01:04:46,918 --> 01:04:48,700
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll play a couple songs that you can find.

861
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:53,965
[SPEAKER_11]: There are Bomani songs that are typically in the game, but you can find them on the US VRare 2 soundtrack.

862
01:04:55,527 --> 01:04:57,609
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to hear... Oh, we played that first break, yeah.

863
01:04:57,769 --> 01:05:04,196
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to play the Bad Routine, and we'll play some Vanity Angel, because that's a good song.

864
01:05:05,037 --> 01:05:05,217
[SPEAKER_11]: And...

865
01:05:07,253 --> 01:05:09,214
[SPEAKER_11]: We can play the really shitty I Feel Mix.

866
01:05:09,555 --> 01:05:09,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?

867
01:05:09,995 --> 01:05:11,056
[SPEAKER_11]: That's short.

868
01:05:11,736 --> 01:05:13,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we're going to do the I Feel Mix.

869
01:05:13,317 --> 01:05:15,298
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll start off with the I Feel Mix here.

870
01:05:15,338 --> 01:05:16,699
[SPEAKER_11]: The New Age... Here we go.

871
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:18,601
[SPEAKER_11]: This is... Well, judge for yourself.

872
01:05:18,621 --> 01:05:21,843
[SPEAKER_11]: The New Age Hope Mix of I Feel is going to start off this break.

873
01:05:21,863 --> 01:05:24,945
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the New Age Put Me to... The Hope of Going to Sleep Mix.

874
01:05:25,185 --> 01:05:27,407
[SPEAKER_11]: And we will be back with the Orange Lounge Cage Match.

875
01:05:28,147 --> 01:05:28,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

876
01:05:29,228 --> 01:05:29,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Stay tuned.

877
01:05:34,091 --> 01:05:35,212
[SPEAKER_11]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

878
01:05:36,713 --> 01:05:50,965
[SPEAKER_10]: and the CD is currently spinning we'll be back I feel I feel I feel

879
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:04,606
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel... I feel... I feel... You will not hear the crappy I feel.

880
01:06:04,646 --> 01:06:05,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Because... Because...

881
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:30,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello Flo, make me a sandwich!

882
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:03,961
Thanks for watching!

883
01:07:48,771 --> 01:07:49,984
Thank you for watching!

884
01:11:57,248 --> 01:12:02,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Random Person on the Street, who by the way is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge Big Money Music and More show?

885
01:12:03,214 --> 01:12:10,341
[SPEAKER_13]: The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

886
01:12:10,682 --> 01:12:12,664
[SPEAKER_13]: It's unearthly.

887
01:12:12,904 --> 01:12:16,628
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

888
01:12:17,488 --> 01:12:19,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

889
01:12:21,438 --> 01:12:25,139
[SPEAKER_11]: on this lovely Sunday evening here, episode number 63 in progress.

890
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:28,720
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're going to get to the cage match in just a minute, but I want to ask you guys about this site.

891
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:30,941
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of you guys were looking at this before the show.

892
01:12:31,501 --> 01:12:35,602
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a site that somebody brought to my attention earlier this week in our chat room.

893
01:12:35,642 --> 01:12:40,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Just head on over to www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.

894
01:12:40,763 --> 01:12:44,744
[SPEAKER_11]: The site is sexiestgamer.com.

895
01:12:46,125 --> 01:12:47,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you guys seen this?

896
01:12:47,365 --> 01:12:50,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on, I'll bring it up over here for you guys that haven't seen it yet.

897
01:12:51,647 --> 01:12:53,428
[SPEAKER_11]: And those of you that are listening, feel free to visit.

898
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:01,692
[SPEAKER_11]: But basically what this website is all about is that there is this website, and I believe it's British.

899
01:13:01,893 --> 01:13:03,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Gamer.TV.

900
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:07,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Gamer.TV is a British network, right?

901
01:13:07,556 --> 01:13:10,957
[SPEAKER_11]: They're trying to find the world's sexiest gamer.

902
01:13:11,398 --> 01:13:12,078
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is what they say.

903
01:13:12,118 --> 01:13:13,799
[SPEAKER_11]: They say, this is kind of what it's about here.

904
01:13:14,585 --> 01:13:15,225
[SPEAKER_11]: What gives?

905
01:13:15,805 --> 01:13:17,446
[SPEAKER_11]: There's booty for the best booty.

906
01:13:17,546 --> 01:13:19,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Find out what's at stake beyond your reputation.

907
01:13:19,746 --> 01:13:24,607
[SPEAKER_11]: So you look here, it says, this is what the whole idea behind Sexiest Gamer is about.

908
01:13:25,487 --> 01:13:30,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Our mission is to prove to the world that gamers are not joystick jockeys glued to their keyboard.

909
01:13:30,408 --> 01:13:38,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Our search for the sexiest gamer gives you, male and female gamers, the opportunity to send in your hottest gaming-related pic.

910
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:42,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Visitors to the site will be able to rate the hotness of each entrant.

911
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:45,536
[SPEAKER_11]: We all know that being a babe means different things to different people.

912
01:13:45,596 --> 01:13:46,678
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't need to be a supermodel.

913
01:13:46,758 --> 01:13:47,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyone can enter.

914
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:48,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Time to get on down.

915
01:13:49,033 --> 01:13:54,256
[SPEAKER_11]: The first round of voting for all selected entrants starts on the 2nd of October and continues until the 20th of November.

916
01:13:54,337 --> 01:13:57,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Based on the first round of voting, 10 finalists will be selected.

917
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:58,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Voting will then begin on the finalists.

918
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:05,104
[SPEAKER_11]: On the 12th of December, 2003, a live grand finale will be held in front of a celebrity judging panel.

919
01:14:05,984 --> 01:14:15,470
[SPEAKER_11]: The finalists will be asked gaming and personality questions and based on their performance and their results from the second round of online voting, the judges will select the male and female winners.

920
01:14:16,931 --> 01:14:17,772
[SPEAKER_11]: And they win a trip.

921
01:14:20,043 --> 01:14:33,215
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm thinking that Orange Lounge has a large and sick enough fan base that maybe I should enter.

922
01:14:36,237 --> 01:14:36,878
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you guys think?

923
01:14:36,898 --> 01:14:37,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Should I enter this?

924
01:14:40,461 --> 01:14:42,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you guys vote me a 10 if I entered?

925
01:14:46,201 --> 01:14:46,821
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm serious.

926
01:14:47,281 --> 01:14:49,582
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to do it if you guys aren't going to back me up.

927
01:14:49,622 --> 01:14:50,822
[SPEAKER_11]: And that includes the chat room.

928
01:14:52,382 --> 01:14:52,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

929
01:14:55,283 --> 01:14:55,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's your beer?

930
01:15:07,666 --> 01:15:08,886
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what happened to your beer, Jamie.

931
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:12,467
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to think about... Jamie, what do you think?

932
01:15:12,527 --> 01:15:13,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Should I enter this?

933
01:15:13,187 --> 01:15:13,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

934
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:18,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

935
01:15:20,741 --> 01:15:21,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you enter it too?

936
01:15:21,741 --> 01:15:21,901
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

937
01:15:22,322 --> 01:15:22,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?

938
01:15:24,123 --> 01:15:27,705
[SPEAKER_11]: I want some female needs to enter to represent Orange Lounge Radio.

939
01:15:28,426 --> 01:15:30,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Erin, I think you need to enter.

940
01:15:31,227 --> 01:15:33,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I think you need to enter the Sexiest Gamer competition with me.

941
01:15:34,309 --> 01:15:34,970
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be me and you.

942
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:35,850
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to win that trip.

943
01:15:36,651 --> 01:15:41,074
[SPEAKER_11]: We will get our Orange Lounge Radio legions of fans to vote for us as Sexiest Gamer.

944
01:15:42,443 --> 01:15:48,906
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is the thing, is that there's so many assholes in the Bomani community that they're going to go and vote us a one just because it's us.

945
01:15:49,546 --> 01:15:54,849
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have to vote over and over and over them in order to pull this off.

946
01:15:55,589 --> 01:15:58,270
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's IP, log on to a dial-up account and do it.

947
01:16:00,572 --> 01:16:01,032
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

948
01:16:01,112 --> 01:16:01,952
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm thinking about it.

949
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:04,633
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have more details as we go on.

950
01:16:04,814 --> 01:16:07,495
[SPEAKER_11]: But think about it, because if Aaron or I could win this thing,

951
01:16:08,234 --> 01:16:12,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we could go on to Gamer.TV and whore the shit out of this station.

952
01:16:14,979 --> 01:16:16,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me that's not a beautiful idea.

953
01:16:18,602 --> 01:16:21,244
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

954
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:23,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we will wear sexy orange clothes.

955
01:16:25,127 --> 01:16:29,490
[SPEAKER_11]: We will wear nothing but orange lounge shirts in our pictures.

956
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:30,151
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

957
01:16:30,951 --> 01:16:31,772
[SPEAKER_11]: An orange lounge suit?

958
01:16:33,273 --> 01:16:33,874
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm serious.

959
01:16:33,894 --> 01:16:35,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Aaron, are you going to enter this shit if I do it?

960
01:16:37,286 --> 01:16:42,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

961
01:16:44,628 --> 01:16:45,388
[SPEAKER_11]: I will see what we can do.

962
01:16:45,988 --> 01:16:46,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

963
01:16:47,309 --> 01:16:48,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Some more to come in future weeks on that.

964
01:16:51,970 --> 01:16:55,170
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll let you know next week where the sexiestgamer.com project stands.

965
01:16:57,371 --> 01:16:59,752
[SPEAKER_11]: In the meantime, how about we have ourselves a cage match?

966
01:16:59,772 --> 01:17:00,492
[SPEAKER_11]: How does that sound?

967
01:17:00,812 --> 01:17:01,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure!

968
01:17:04,321 --> 01:17:07,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Good, I'll give you guys some music to listen to while you're eating.

969
01:17:08,743 --> 01:17:17,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, it was another tie, but the winning song was a little bit surprising, at least to me anyway.

970
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:26,872
[SPEAKER_11]: My song won, and it was a song that was suggested to me by The Ice Bitch, who hasn't been to a show in a while, but he suggested this before the show last week.

971
01:17:27,353 --> 01:17:29,574
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of a booty song, it's a song that maybe...

972
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:33,752
[SPEAKER_11]: You could hear one day on Solo 2000, something like that.

973
01:17:33,772 --> 01:17:36,074
[SPEAKER_03]: This song is like the epitome of booties.

974
01:17:37,074 --> 01:17:38,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, here it is.

975
01:17:38,675 --> 01:17:41,317
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the song that won last week and the first song you can vote for tonight.

976
01:17:41,917 --> 01:17:45,399
[SPEAKER_11]: The way the cage match works, just a reminder, you have to be in our chat room to participate.

977
01:17:45,579 --> 01:17:47,501
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a listener-supported event.

978
01:17:47,681 --> 01:17:50,863
[SPEAKER_11]: www.callybomani.com Click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.

979
01:17:51,163 --> 01:17:52,884
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to play three songs for you guys.

980
01:17:53,224 --> 01:17:55,806
[SPEAKER_11]: After the three songs are over, you vote on your favorite.

981
01:17:55,826 --> 01:17:59,328
[SPEAKER_11]: The winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio and comes back next week.

982
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:03,272
[SPEAKER_11]: So since this song won last week, you only get to hear a clip of it.

983
01:18:04,052 --> 01:18:08,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's last week's... No, sorry, you only get to hear a clip of it.

984
01:18:08,094 --> 01:18:08,614
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the rule.

985
01:18:08,794 --> 01:18:09,775
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not fair to the other songs.

986
01:18:09,815 --> 01:18:10,795
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not fair to the other songs.

987
01:18:11,176 --> 01:18:12,616
[SPEAKER_11]: This is song number one tonight.

988
01:18:12,656 --> 01:18:15,958
[SPEAKER_11]: The band is Fanny Pack, and the song is Camel Toe.

989
01:18:16,098 --> 01:18:16,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy.

990
01:19:43,232 --> 01:19:44,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that was song number one.

991
01:19:45,533 --> 01:19:47,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Fanny Pack with Camel Toe.

992
01:19:48,254 --> 01:19:48,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Last week's winner.

993
01:19:48,954 --> 01:19:50,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, let's get on into our next song.

994
01:19:50,894 --> 01:19:52,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Next song will be Loki's song.

995
01:19:52,075 --> 01:19:53,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't you tell us about it, Loki?

996
01:19:55,656 --> 01:20:02,478
[SPEAKER_11]: This song is featured on the Diverse Systems CD, Hello Boss, which is a remix CD of all Bomani music.

997
01:20:03,058 --> 01:20:08,260
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're done by these independent artists from Japan who do a lot of the BMS files you find out there.

998
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,761
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're talking quality music.

999
01:20:10,781 --> 01:20:11,601
[SPEAKER_11]: The best

1000
01:20:12,991 --> 01:20:14,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Beat Mania Files, if you ever find out there.

1001
01:20:16,494 --> 01:20:20,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely not this crap that you would see in, like, maybe, uh, I don't know, Tourney Mix or something like that.

1002
01:20:21,137 --> 01:20:23,738
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um, no, this is really quality music.

1003
01:20:24,079 --> 01:20:26,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, they sell a CD in Japan, Diverse Systems.

1004
01:20:26,961 --> 01:20:32,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, this song is called, um, P8107.

1005
01:20:33,665 --> 01:20:40,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, what the 8107 means, I don't know, but it's a remix of Paranoia that's fucking awesome, so...

1006
01:20:41,158 --> 01:20:43,063
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Ono Ken with PH107

1007
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:15,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, song number two.

1008
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:19,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Onokan with PB1, er, I'm sorry, P8107.

1009
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:20,522
[SPEAKER_11]: I keep reading that as PB.

1010
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:21,522
[SPEAKER_11]: I have peanut butter on my mind.

1011
01:23:21,982 --> 01:23:25,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go around and get votes from our studio.

1012
01:23:25,903 --> 01:23:26,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie.

1013
01:23:27,064 --> 01:23:28,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, this one gets a 9.

1014
01:23:29,364 --> 01:23:32,185
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason it doesn't get a 10 is because it's more paranoia.

1015
01:23:34,206 --> 01:23:34,626
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

1016
01:23:35,966 --> 01:23:37,907
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than that, it's like, damn, damn perfect.

1017
01:23:39,504 --> 01:23:48,955
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll go next, I agree with Jamie, same score, I give it a 9, same reason, it's another paranoia, but it's very cool because it sounds like tack, and that's cool.

1018
01:23:50,777 --> 01:23:51,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki!

1019
01:23:51,919 --> 01:23:59,788
[SPEAKER_11]: It gets a 10 because it's the most awesome paranoia remake ever, and it will blow the crap out of whatever this paranoia respect piece of shit's gonna be.

1020
01:24:01,109 --> 01:24:02,950
[SPEAKER_11]: So, it's way better.

1021
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:08,652
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is another example of how Konami has failed us as a company in producing a quality dancing game.

1022
01:24:09,332 --> 01:24:17,916
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, you can really save yourself a lot of money and license some of these independent artists to make really kick-ass music for almost nothing.

1023
01:24:18,456 --> 01:24:22,258
[SPEAKER_11]: But no, go ahead, license your expensive tracks that suck ass like wannabe.

1024
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:23,058
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine.

1025
01:24:23,278 --> 01:24:23,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

1026
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:26,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, moving on.

1027
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:27,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

1028
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,500
[SPEAKER_11]: Jonas just arrived.

1029
01:24:28,681 --> 01:24:29,301
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you have to say?

1030
01:24:30,578 --> 01:24:32,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, 10 for Loki's reasons as well.

1031
01:24:33,939 --> 01:24:38,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, this is like the only Paranoia Remix I actually think is one of the best of all time.

1032
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:44,622
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know why the hell they have the speed of Paranoia Survivor.

1033
01:24:45,402 --> 01:24:46,703
[SPEAKER_13]: Almost from 200 to 270.

1034
01:24:46,783 --> 01:24:58,266
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you've got like Paranoia Evil, that's how it grabs like... You know Paranoia Red, which has almost no rhythm to it.

1035
01:24:59,659 --> 01:25:03,481
[SPEAKER_11]: This blows the shit out of any fan-made Paranoia remix, basically.

1036
01:25:03,501 --> 01:25:08,805
[SPEAKER_13]: The only one I could actually see acceptable was probably Paranoia Massive.

1037
01:25:08,825 --> 01:25:10,626
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think this is a lot better.

1038
01:25:10,646 --> 01:25:12,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1039
01:25:13,047 --> 01:25:15,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Does your friend that you brought along want to comment on this at all?

1040
01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:23,474
[SPEAKER_11]: No, he's... Seven.

1041
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:25,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, sadly...

1042
01:25:28,976 --> 01:25:34,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty good, but I'm not as impressed by it as you people are, but I'll give it an 8.

1043
01:25:35,622 --> 01:25:36,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, an 8 from Bradley.

1044
01:25:37,764 --> 01:25:41,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Violent Hyper Girl, Chef Iron... Violent Chef Girl.

1045
01:25:44,409 --> 01:25:49,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, um, it was okay, it wasn't too bad, but it's still more paranoia yet again, so I guess an 8.

1046
01:25:49,934 --> 01:25:55,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not so bad, but it wasn't really overly great, you know, like, oh my god, great.

1047
01:25:57,054 --> 01:26:02,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, and last but not least, Puppy.

1048
01:26:02,599 --> 01:26:15,069
[SPEAKER_10]: When Loki first said online that he found a good Paranoia remix, I was like, either you're shitting me or the sun's about to explode, so I went outside to see if the sun exploded yet.

1049
01:26:15,709 --> 01:26:24,897
[SPEAKER_10]: It hadn't, so I wasn't sure, but now that I've heard it, it's actually good, and I like it, and I give it a 10, and I just hope that we aren't all dead tomorrow.

1050
01:26:26,041 --> 01:26:36,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, chat room seems to really take a liking to that one, but you guys, it's not over yet, we have one more song in the cage match, and it's Jamie's entry, and why don't you tell us a little something about it, Jamie?

1051
01:26:36,432 --> 01:26:38,975
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Delirium, after all, remixed by Samson and Ewan.

1052
01:26:39,693 --> 01:26:41,154
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1053
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:21,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, that was song number three, Delirium, featuring Jael, with After All, the Svensson and Ghislaine mix.

1054
01:30:21,822 --> 01:30:22,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Janie?

1055
01:30:23,262 --> 01:30:23,783
[SPEAKER_14]: It gets ten.

1056
01:30:24,803 --> 01:30:25,183
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it?

1057
01:30:26,223 --> 01:30:26,643
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

1058
01:30:27,484 --> 01:30:28,244
[SPEAKER_11]: I give it a nine.

1059
01:30:28,564 --> 01:30:29,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Very nice.

1060
01:30:29,624 --> 01:30:30,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Good vocal.

1061
01:30:30,565 --> 01:30:35,546
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good contrast to the other song, too, and certainly to song one, because it has vocals.

1062
01:30:37,327 --> 01:30:37,847
[SPEAKER_11]: It's nice.

1063
01:30:38,127 --> 01:30:38,627
[SPEAKER_11]: I like it.

1064
01:30:38,807 --> 01:30:39,187
[SPEAKER_11]: I dig it.

1065
01:30:40,128 --> 01:30:41,528
[SPEAKER_11]: Svensson and Ghislaine are the shit.

1066
01:30:42,508 --> 01:30:44,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki is in the kitchen.

1067
01:30:50,114 --> 01:30:51,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Both the women weren't so dirty.

1068
01:30:52,075 --> 01:31:01,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Um... Fine, I'll make some of my instant rice in my rice cooker.

1069
01:31:02,642 --> 01:31:03,942
[SPEAKER_11]: And it'll be instant goodness.

1070
01:31:04,543 --> 01:31:05,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, nah.

1071
01:31:05,844 --> 01:31:07,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Um... It was alright.

1072
01:31:07,925 --> 01:31:13,168
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard that song, like, numerous times on numerous CDs, so it's... Really worn out.

1073
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:14,769
[SPEAKER_11]: To me.

1074
01:31:15,129 --> 01:31:15,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus, I have the CD.

1075
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:16,810
[SPEAKER_11]: It's somewhere around here.

1076
01:31:17,971 --> 01:31:18,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh!

1077
01:31:20,407 --> 01:31:21,808
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's... yeah.

1078
01:31:23,049 --> 01:31:23,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, alright.

1079
01:31:24,249 --> 01:31:25,670
[SPEAKER_11]: But is it the Svensson and Gillen mix?

1080
01:31:27,891 --> 01:31:28,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Give it a number already.

1081
01:31:29,753 --> 01:31:34,695
[SPEAKER_11]: I give it number... two.

1082
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:36,877
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I give it a... eight.

1083
01:31:37,497 --> 01:31:37,917
[SPEAKER_11]: That's cool.

1084
01:31:39,098 --> 01:31:39,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, moving on.

1085
01:31:39,959 --> 01:31:40,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Jonas.

1086
01:31:43,801 --> 01:31:44,962
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll give it a nine.

1087
01:31:44,982 --> 01:31:48,784
[SPEAKER_13]: I like the song, the lyrics, the way they actually did the trance itself.

1088
01:31:49,602 --> 01:31:52,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Does it make it sound like more GTS or generic kind of shit?

1089
01:31:54,607 --> 01:31:55,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, uh, Bradley.

1090
01:31:56,609 --> 01:31:57,349
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty good.

1091
01:31:57,389 --> 01:31:58,090
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give it an 8.5.

1092
01:31:59,711 --> 01:32:00,392
[SPEAKER_09]: SilentHyperGirl.

1093
01:32:01,954 --> 01:32:02,634
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that was okay.

1094
01:32:02,654 --> 01:32:03,475
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't too bad.

1095
01:32:03,775 --> 01:32:06,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice, kind of, subtle fan.

1096
01:32:06,898 --> 01:32:07,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Give it a 9.

1097
01:32:08,826 --> 01:32:09,307
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, sounds good.

1098
01:32:09,627 --> 01:32:09,908
[SPEAKER_12]: Puppy?

1099
01:32:11,831 --> 01:32:21,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, it's a decent song, it just didn't really catch my attention and suck me in like any, like a song I like would have, so I was gonna A.

1100
01:32:22,978 --> 01:32:24,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that's the votes.

1101
01:32:25,559 --> 01:32:26,280
[SPEAKER_11]: That's interesting.

1102
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:29,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Both songs entered in tonight against last week's winner.

1103
01:32:29,661 --> 01:32:33,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody gave either one anything below an 8, which is kind of interesting.

1104
01:32:33,043 --> 01:32:34,344
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that's ever happened before.

1105
01:32:34,484 --> 01:32:36,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually somebody's giving somebody else a 4.

1106
01:32:37,185 --> 01:32:38,385
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you can't change your vote.

1107
01:32:38,405 --> 01:32:39,146
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too late.

1108
01:32:39,906 --> 01:32:46,049
[SPEAKER_11]: So, all the songs are well liked by the studio tonight.

1109
01:32:46,149 --> 01:32:47,030
[SPEAKER_11]: They're saying except number 1.

1110
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:49,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, number 1 won last week, so somebody liked it.

1111
01:32:51,454 --> 01:32:58,897
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a quick recap before we let you vote, and you'll be voting by sending private messages to Sky, but here you go, here's a quick recap.

1112
01:32:58,937 --> 01:33:03,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Song number one, Fanny Pack with Camel Toe is the first song you can vote for tonight.

1113
01:33:11,302 --> 01:33:13,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is P8107.

1114
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:33,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, song number three you can vote for tonight is Delirium featuring Jaliel with After All, the Svensson and Ghislaine mix.

1115
01:33:46,114 --> 01:33:49,358
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, place vote now!

1116
01:33:54,568 --> 01:34:01,351
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you don't know how to do that, you can either double click on somebody's name or you type slash msg sky and then your vote.

1117
01:34:06,172 --> 01:34:08,893
[SPEAKER_11]: And you guys have about three minutes to place your votes for the cage match.

1118
01:34:09,414 --> 01:34:14,355
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Jonas, you showed up before we got into cage match.

1119
01:34:14,375 --> 01:34:14,896
[SPEAKER_11]: What's new with you?

1120
01:34:14,936 --> 01:34:15,756
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't seen you in a while.

1121
01:34:16,256 --> 01:34:17,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, not much.

1122
01:34:17,116 --> 01:34:17,977
[SPEAKER_13]: College.

1123
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:20,298
[SPEAKER_13]: Made a few DWIs.

1124
01:34:23,115 --> 01:34:25,536
[SPEAKER_11]: and you want to plug those, where can people find them and what are they called?

1125
01:34:25,676 --> 01:34:32,179
[SPEAKER_13]: That's on my website, www.gameroom.com slash explicit.

1126
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:35,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on, let me see if you type me that right.

1127
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:39,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Huh, what are you going to do here?

1128
01:34:40,222 --> 01:34:42,143
[SPEAKER_13]: Just make sure you spell explicit right.

1129
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:42,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

1130
01:34:42,443 --> 01:34:44,904
[SPEAKER_13]: You spell it wrong and you get the wrong link.

1131
01:34:47,746 --> 01:34:48,426
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that?

1132
01:34:48,546 --> 01:34:48,566
3X.

1133
01:34:49,597 --> 01:34:58,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, XXXPLIZIT, okay.

1134
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:03,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so I'm going to post that site in the chat room for you guys if you want to visit the explicit site.

1135
01:35:03,821 --> 01:35:04,161
[SPEAKER_11]: There it is.

1136
01:35:05,202 --> 01:35:10,443
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me see, the last time I came here, I've only had like around 7 sim files.

1137
01:35:10,503 --> 01:35:14,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Now I have like 11 released, including Paranoia Massive.

1138
01:35:14,104 --> 01:35:16,785
[SPEAKER_13]: For those of you who want to try it out.

1139
01:35:19,830 --> 01:35:21,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's the friend that you brought with you tonight?

1140
01:35:21,771 --> 01:35:22,412
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my cousin.

1141
01:35:22,992 --> 01:35:23,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, your cousin.

1142
01:35:25,154 --> 01:35:26,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's say hello to the cousin.

1143
01:35:30,057 --> 01:35:31,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, he's a little radio shy?

1144
01:35:34,119 --> 01:35:35,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

1145
01:35:36,341 --> 01:35:36,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Erwin.

1146
01:35:37,242 --> 01:35:37,682
[SPEAKER_11]: How you doing?

1147
01:35:39,303 --> 01:35:39,723
[SPEAKER_11]: He's quiet.

1148
01:35:39,763 --> 01:35:40,243
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, all right.

1149
01:35:40,324 --> 01:35:40,704
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine.

1150
01:35:40,964 --> 01:35:41,344
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine.

1151
01:35:45,267 --> 01:35:45,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

1152
01:35:45,747 --> 01:35:46,608
[SPEAKER_11]: What else is new?

1153
01:35:47,188 --> 01:35:48,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, you got a minute over there?

1154
01:35:50,260 --> 01:35:51,340
[SPEAKER_11]: You got a minute over there, Loki?

1155
01:35:53,021 --> 01:35:53,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Here he comes.

1156
01:35:53,681 --> 01:35:58,002
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to know if you would tell us about... Don't tap the mic, because that goes out of the air.

1157
01:35:58,322 --> 01:36:00,262
[SPEAKER_11]: If you'd tell us all what's going on in the sim world.

1158
01:36:01,623 --> 01:36:03,003
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some stupid contest.

1159
01:36:03,443 --> 01:36:07,904
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called TourneyMix 4.5+, my ass.

1160
01:36:09,505 --> 01:36:11,025
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not important, so you shouldn't care.

1161
01:36:12,441 --> 01:36:13,041
[SPEAKER_11]: TheFNDC.com

1162
01:36:33,573 --> 01:36:50,700
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought the reason why they entered, like, made Tournament Mix 4 a plus is because people are, like, sick and tired of this anime and trance category being, plaguing, like, Tournament Mix 4.

1163
01:36:51,161 --> 01:36:51,541
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

1164
01:36:51,801 --> 01:36:51,961
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1165
01:36:52,721 --> 01:36:57,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me bitch some more about my tournament that I'm holding.

1166
01:36:57,623 --> 01:36:59,564
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't hold it then if you don't want to bitch about it.

1167
01:36:59,584 --> 01:36:59,744
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

1168
01:37:01,779 --> 01:37:02,780
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not going to miss it.

1169
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:06,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, there's a site called Bomani Sims, or should I say Bomani Style.

1170
01:37:06,581 --> 01:37:08,462
[SPEAKER_11]: New music comes up there all the time.

1171
01:37:08,582 --> 01:37:09,042
[SPEAKER_11]: And guess what?

1172
01:37:09,102 --> 01:37:12,084
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not all trance and, you know, anime music.

1173
01:37:12,284 --> 01:37:17,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Other music exists out there, but you limit everyone by what you can put in there so you don't get anything good.

1174
01:37:17,726 --> 01:37:18,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop whining.

1175
01:37:18,946 --> 01:37:23,108
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, there's been some real shit on Bomani Style's system.

1176
01:37:23,808 --> 01:37:28,210
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I've seen some country songs in there and just some weird shit.

1177
01:37:30,953 --> 01:37:32,154
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I agree.

1178
01:37:32,194 --> 01:37:34,016
[SPEAKER_13]: TurnMix is run by stupid people.

1179
01:37:35,076 --> 01:37:36,177
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, some stupid people.

1180
01:37:36,518 --> 01:37:39,720
[SPEAKER_13]: How the hell did they put Legend of Arc third place in TurnMix 4?

1181
01:37:41,161 --> 01:37:44,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, think about all the work that went into it.

1182
01:37:45,285 --> 01:37:48,127
[SPEAKER_11]: He shot his own video, he made his own steps, he made his own song.

1183
01:37:48,167 --> 01:37:48,968
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's pretty good.

1184
01:37:49,348 --> 01:37:58,836
[SPEAKER_11]: As opposed to, like, I shit out steps for a song that I named wrong because I got it off of Kazaa, and I don't know what the real title is, so I'm going to say it's the Inspector Gadget theme.

1185
01:37:59,236 --> 01:38:06,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though it's a classical piece, because I'm a stupid white person that doesn't know what real music is.

1186
01:38:07,581 --> 01:38:08,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a hint.

1187
01:38:08,722 --> 01:38:12,405
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to just give the tourney mix planners, the people that plan the next tourney mix, some advice.

1188
01:38:12,685 --> 01:38:14,707
[SPEAKER_11]: And let me tell you something here, right out the gate.

1189
01:38:14,967 --> 01:38:18,270
[SPEAKER_11]: No matter what you do, people are going to bitch that the contest sucks.

1190
01:38:18,571 --> 01:38:20,813
[SPEAKER_11]: So don't even listen to us, don't listen to the chat room, whatever.

1191
01:38:20,853 --> 01:38:22,835
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're happy doing your thing, do your thing, okay?

1192
01:38:23,075 --> 01:38:26,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Because somebody's going to not like it, and you're just going to have to deal with that.

1193
01:38:26,158 --> 01:38:28,660
[SPEAKER_11]: That's part of doing things and having a big tournament.

1194
01:38:29,861 --> 01:38:30,241
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1195
01:38:50,851 --> 01:38:54,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Some sort of song that needs to have some audio quality set on it.

1196
01:38:54,992 --> 01:38:57,832
[SPEAKER_11]: They need to be 192 or whatever quality.

1197
01:38:57,852 --> 01:38:59,953
[SPEAKER_11]: They need to have some kind of audio quality set on it.

1198
01:38:59,973 --> 01:39:02,833
[SPEAKER_11]: If they're not meeting these minimal standards, do not waste my bandwidth.

1199
01:39:03,733 --> 01:39:05,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Number one, learn how to draw.

1200
01:39:05,814 --> 01:39:06,574
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not that hard.

1201
01:39:06,614 --> 01:39:11,295
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can't draw, take someone's picture, make it look nice, put a title on it, done.

1202
01:39:11,435 --> 01:39:12,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Give credit where it's due.

1203
01:39:12,815 --> 01:39:14,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't draw shit and paint.

1204
01:39:14,555 --> 01:39:15,535
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like crap.

1205
01:39:16,156 --> 01:39:18,376
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've seen so many sim files where they...

1206
01:39:19,156 --> 01:39:21,479
[SPEAKER_11]: The banner art and stuff is just like utter shit.

1207
01:39:21,639 --> 01:39:22,740
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care if you can't draw.

1208
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:23,922
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not that difficult.

1209
01:39:24,322 --> 01:39:25,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Use fucking Photoshop filters.

1210
01:39:25,964 --> 01:39:26,845
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not that hard.

1211
01:39:26,985 --> 01:39:31,110
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't draw that much in Photoshop, but I use filters out of the ass, and it looks good.

1212
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:38,358
[SPEAKER_11]: So, just do that, and just, you know, pick good songs, you know, pick this crap, cut it good if, you know...

1213
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:43,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Make sure the steps sync and make sense and aren't insanely hard.

1214
01:39:43,962 --> 01:39:49,406
[SPEAKER_11]: And number one of all things they should do is do not put who made the file on the file.

1215
01:39:50,167 --> 01:39:58,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Because when you do that, you make people want to play these files because, oh, it's this person, and they won't play the file, they'll just vote because they like this person.

1216
01:39:58,412 --> 01:40:01,454
[SPEAKER_11]: No, if you don't put, you know, what person is... BMR.

1217
01:40:02,195 --> 01:40:04,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, what each file, who each file is made by.

1218
01:40:04,536 --> 01:40:08,619
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't put that on there until the very end, when all the voting is done,

1219
01:40:09,339 --> 01:40:10,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Then you'll get a more fair vote.

1220
01:40:11,099 --> 01:40:28,163
[SPEAKER_11]: But when you go ahead and put, you know, who made each file and all this stuff, and when you have people, you know, promoting their files like that, and I don't care if you promote your files, but the fact is that people are only voting, like, 30 people voted on one file, which might have been pretty good, but, you know, the ones that suck, like, Max, uh, whatever that was, I don't... Which one?

1221
01:40:28,643 --> 01:40:28,903
Neomax?

1222
01:40:29,223 --> 01:40:30,223
[SPEAKER_11]: The Neomax.

1223
01:40:30,503 --> 01:40:31,544
[SPEAKER_11]: Neomax, you know what?

1224
01:40:31,804 --> 01:40:32,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wow.

1225
01:40:32,564 --> 01:40:37,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you made your own little thing out of a MIDI program with, you know, fucking, um...

1226
01:40:37,932 --> 01:41:07,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Fruity Loops, Whoopty Doo, Should I Pat You On Your Back I don't give a fucking shit if you made that song because it sucked it's just another Max remix that sucks so what if you put more work into it I put work into Legend of Trance and you know what I don't give a shit if it sucks it's fine you don't see me bitching about it but here's the thing everyone's like oh it's the BNCDR it's so cool no I'm sorry the thing I just played a little bit ago you know the Paranoia remix that was 100,000 times better than your fucking song okay that's what I have to say about that

1227
01:41:08,484 --> 01:41:19,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, in fact, that's another thing, is people are like, oh, well, I wanna, you know, vote for this, because, and they didn't really play the song, they just, you know, voted for it because they're like, oh, and you know, Max is so cool, oh my god, this guy can be in DDR, oh!

1228
01:41:19,730 --> 01:41:21,091
[SPEAKER_13]: That also gets me to one point.

1229
01:41:22,032 --> 01:41:23,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you know Boomerang, right?

1230
01:41:23,252 --> 01:41:24,853
[SPEAKER_13]: He's been done by BMR, right?

1231
01:41:25,113 --> 01:41:29,356
[SPEAKER_13]: He just re-edited the steps, put it on, people just overrate his ass, and...

1232
01:41:30,041 --> 01:41:35,327
[SPEAKER_03]: With some of the things I've heard out of there, I think that a very loud fart would sound better than some of those.

1233
01:41:36,749 --> 01:41:39,372
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thought he quit making sim files like three years ago.

1234
01:41:39,412 --> 01:41:40,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on now.

1235
01:41:40,934 --> 01:41:48,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's, okay, here's my, this is why maybe, I'm just going to kind of play devil's advocate here and tell you why maybe they have not gone to the anonymous system.

1236
01:41:49,346 --> 01:41:52,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's say you submit a file to the Tourney Mix and it's anonymous, whatever.

1237
01:41:53,289 --> 01:41:54,150
[SPEAKER_11]: But let's say I do it.

1238
01:41:54,410 --> 01:41:56,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, everybody knows I'm not going to enter Tourney Mix because I know I'm not talented enough.

1239
01:41:57,472 --> 01:42:06,619
[SPEAKER_11]: I go in and then I come on this station and say, Oh, hey, by the way, you guys, I entered 2 Become 1 by the Spice Girls in the contest and you all need to go vote for it at 10.

1240
01:42:06,919 --> 01:42:08,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there, I've just fucked up the whole anonymous thing.

1241
01:42:09,101 --> 01:42:12,983
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you going to keep 200 people quiet and not get their friends to go on there and vote their songs 10?

1242
01:42:13,564 --> 01:42:14,605
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why the anonymous thing...

1243
01:42:15,185 --> 01:42:16,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably has not been tested.

1244
01:42:16,647 --> 01:42:20,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, you could say, oh, if we find you, we'll get you, but you know that's not going to work.

1245
01:42:20,972 --> 01:42:21,713
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not Big Brother.

1246
01:42:21,753 --> 01:42:23,615
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't see everywhere and stuff, you know, so.

1247
01:42:25,537 --> 01:42:26,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Any comments on that, Loki?

1248
01:42:26,418 --> 01:42:30,903
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just going to say, do you have any comments on that?

1249
01:42:30,924 --> 01:42:33,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I was playing devil's advocate to your anonymous idea.

1250
01:42:34,087 --> 01:42:35,269
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't listening to what you were saying.

1251
01:42:36,283 --> 01:42:36,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, real quick.

1252
01:42:38,204 --> 01:42:43,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's say I submit an entry, and then I come on Orange Lounge Radio and say, Hey guys, look for my entry such and such.

1253
01:42:44,008 --> 01:42:44,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Vote for it at 10.

1254
01:42:45,089 --> 01:42:47,370
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now haven't I just ruined the whole anonymous thing?

1255
01:42:50,752 --> 01:42:52,613
[SPEAKER_11]: No, because guess what?

1256
01:42:52,733 --> 01:42:55,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Not everyone gets on this radio show and promotes their thoughts except for me.

1257
01:42:56,755 --> 01:42:59,817
[SPEAKER_11]: But what about, let's take somebody like the well-known people.

1258
01:43:00,157 --> 01:43:08,022
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what you're trying to prevent, is you're trying to prevent the well-known people from winning every time, basically, just because of the well-known ones, and they're the ones who get their files downloaded.

1259
01:43:08,302 --> 01:43:12,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now all these well-known people post on boards, and some of them will post their own shit.

1260
01:43:12,664 --> 01:43:14,746
[SPEAKER_11]: They're proud of their stuff, as they should be.

1261
01:43:14,866 --> 01:43:16,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, fine, just make a rule against it.

1262
01:43:16,687 --> 01:43:17,387
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty easy.

1263
01:43:17,567 --> 01:43:19,869
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like they didn't rule about distributing files.

1264
01:43:20,469 --> 01:43:21,910
[SPEAKER_11]: But you're not Big Brother, you can't see everything.

1265
01:43:23,274 --> 01:43:36,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but there's thousands of little minions of mine that are running around boards that are waiting to, you know, fucking, you know, turn this bastard in because they also have a sim file posted in TourneyMix, you know, because they have, like, 300 people entering this goddamn piece of shit.

1266
01:43:36,886 --> 01:43:44,533
[SPEAKER_11]: So, obviously, you've got, you know, 300 people looking for their files on all these boards, so trust me, it gets covered pretty easy.

1267
01:43:45,754 --> 01:43:46,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1268
01:43:46,542 --> 01:43:49,625
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, um, can I say something about the turn mixes and all the sim files?

1269
01:43:49,705 --> 01:43:50,386
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh hell why not.

1270
01:43:50,787 --> 01:43:58,114
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there's like a lot of people I know that are like underrated and making sim files, but when I download some of them, they're actually hella good, just for the quality of the steps.

1271
01:43:58,174 --> 01:44:01,518
[SPEAKER_11]: That's another thing, when is Civis, okay, the guy that's fuckin',

1272
01:44:01,878 --> 01:44:04,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Runs DDR, EI What's he know about sim files?

1273
01:44:04,620 --> 01:44:06,382
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see him making shit, okay?

1274
01:44:06,462 --> 01:44:06,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Now where is he?

1275
01:44:06,982 --> 01:44:24,697
[SPEAKER_11]: You got like Moogle Hunter, he knows how to make sim files Now he would be a good judge Amani Ruler, he's made sim files I bet he writes hard files, that's the only problem Hey, it's fine, he's made sim files He ran a sim file site that's different You know, you've got the guy Those people Those should be the judges we have

1276
01:44:25,397 --> 01:44:30,262
[SPEAKER_11]: What are all these other people going like, oh, your file sucks ass because I don't like trance music.

1277
01:44:30,482 --> 01:44:34,907
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry you don't like trance music, but you know what, that doesn't have anything to do with this.

1278
01:44:35,247 --> 01:44:36,428
[SPEAKER_11]: They're judging the song.

1279
01:44:36,569 --> 01:44:37,550
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like this song.

1280
01:44:37,670 --> 01:44:38,911
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a sim file contest.

1281
01:44:38,951 --> 01:44:40,913
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about the file, not the fucking song.

1282
01:44:41,313 --> 01:44:42,655
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care if you don't like this song.

1283
01:44:43,295 --> 01:44:48,041
[SPEAKER_13]: Or like people who made those SM errors, you know, Step Mania errors Oh yeah, Step Mania sucks!

1284
01:44:48,221 --> 01:45:01,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Well that's maybe if DWI fucking updated their goddamn program within the last six months You know, we'd have people using that But I'm sorry, because Step Mania is like 100,000 times better than DWI So why don't you just have a Step Mania contest?

1285
01:45:01,716 --> 01:45:02,656
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, seriously.

1286
01:45:03,036 --> 01:45:07,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they're maniacs, so people can make files easy.

1287
01:45:07,298 --> 01:45:09,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they're not doing it old school in Notepad.

1288
01:45:10,599 --> 01:45:12,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Cry, cry, cry some more for me.

1289
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,801
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't matter if it's just Notepad or anything.

1290
01:45:14,861 --> 01:45:16,541
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the way the quality of stuff is.

1291
01:45:17,001 --> 01:45:18,662
[SPEAKER_13]: If you have something bust up with, like,

1292
01:45:21,813 --> 01:45:30,718
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole point of this thing and the argument we get down to at the very end every time is that this tournament sucks.

1293
01:45:31,218 --> 01:45:33,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Tournament sucks, just don't enter it, just whatever.

1294
01:45:34,299 --> 01:45:42,563
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I do, I don't enter it, I don't give a shit, I just at the very end, I download the files, weed out like the ten that are any good and delete the rest.

1295
01:45:42,683 --> 01:45:44,044
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what I do with everything.

1296
01:45:44,687 --> 01:45:52,373
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, it looks like turnmix is like a bias, because anyone can throw like a porno video and get a number one spot on the turnmix, even though there's just a porno.

1297
01:45:52,573 --> 01:45:53,314
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a big joke.

1298
01:45:53,374 --> 01:45:54,375
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole thing's a joke.

1299
01:45:54,875 --> 01:45:57,017
[SPEAKER_10]: It was good when it was just like a little fun contest.

1300
01:45:57,037 --> 01:45:57,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Turnmix 1!

1301
01:45:57,878 --> 01:46:02,021
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to make this a biannual thing where we, you know, do this and everyone's looking up to it.

1302
01:46:02,261 --> 01:46:03,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Who gives a shit?

1303
01:46:03,302 --> 01:46:05,184
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a fucking contest.

1304
01:46:05,224 --> 01:46:07,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I was thinking about entering turnmix 4 plus just for the hell of it.

1305
01:46:08,246 --> 01:46:09,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Use that existing sim file.

1306
01:46:11,028 --> 01:46:12,670
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I'm going to use that song for wins.

1307
01:46:14,525 --> 01:46:20,933
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, I don't care anymore because, you know, if I want to get quality sim files, they're not made by U.S.

1308
01:46:20,973 --> 01:46:21,293
[SPEAKER_11]: people.

1309
01:46:21,433 --> 01:46:23,315
[SPEAKER_11]: They're the Japanese people that are making the sim files.

1310
01:46:23,536 --> 01:46:27,500
[SPEAKER_11]: They're the people back from when, you know, Dance Dance Evolution, that site was around.

1311
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:33,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Back when, you know, Fifth Mix was coming out for the arcade and sim files were coming up for that back in Delight Deliverance.

1312
01:46:33,547 --> 01:46:35,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Duplication.

1313
01:46:36,029 --> 01:46:37,350
[SPEAKER_11]: This site was up.

1314
01:46:37,650 --> 01:46:41,612
[SPEAKER_11]: This was the only place where you can get all your official steps.

1315
01:46:41,632 --> 01:46:43,914
[SPEAKER_11]: This was the site, and it was run by Japanese people.

1316
01:46:44,154 --> 01:46:51,979
[SPEAKER_11]: And they also had originals, which had all difficulties, and they were intelligent steps, really nice backgrounds, professional, done everything.

1317
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:52,860
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what?

1318
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:57,123
[SPEAKER_11]: When that site died, people didn't realize that the small site with the originals is still up.

1319
01:46:57,423 --> 01:46:58,063
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what?

1320
01:46:58,144 --> 01:47:03,227
[SPEAKER_11]: I get sim files from there, and they're 100,000 times better than all these stupid sim files that people make.

1321
01:47:03,787 --> 01:47:06,429
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we need to change the pace, what do the rest of you think?

1322
01:47:32,611 --> 01:47:34,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, how about we announce the winner of the cage match?

1323
01:47:37,335 --> 01:47:38,195
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry about the delay.

1324
01:47:38,596 --> 01:47:39,196
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's alright.

1325
01:47:39,557 --> 01:47:40,737
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody needs to vent once in a while.

1326
01:47:40,757 --> 01:47:42,099
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why we have the FUs coming up.

1327
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:44,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.

1328
01:47:45,141 --> 01:47:46,882
[SPEAKER_11]: You two need to keep a quota tonight though.

1329
01:47:46,902 --> 01:47:49,324
[SPEAKER_11]: You just bitched for about five minutes there.

1330
01:47:49,725 --> 01:47:51,546
[SPEAKER_11]: So that comes off your FU times.

1331
01:47:52,146 --> 01:47:52,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1332
01:47:54,077 --> 01:47:56,078
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah, Loki's like, I'll drop it from 20 to 19.

1333
01:47:57,219 --> 01:48:03,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge Cage Match, I have to say this, song number one, my pick, didn't get a single vote.

1334
01:48:04,964 --> 01:48:15,190
[SPEAKER_11]: So, we had last week's winner did not get a single vote, and between the other two, fairly close, a lot of people voting, but in the end, the winner was P8107.

1335
01:48:23,635 --> 01:48:27,897
[SPEAKER_11]: People felt very strongly about one song or the other, though, just looking in our chat room.

1336
01:48:27,937 --> 01:48:34,680
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll just see what happens next week when P8107 comes back and does battle against two new picks.

1337
01:48:38,042 --> 01:48:40,563
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also another song that Onokid did.

1338
01:48:40,903 --> 01:48:42,904
[SPEAKER_11]: You can play it later on break.

1339
01:48:43,504 --> 01:48:44,265
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll do that later.

1340
01:48:44,505 --> 01:48:45,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Jamie.

1341
01:48:45,886 --> 01:48:45,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

1342
01:48:47,262 --> 01:48:48,223
[SPEAKER_11]: I took a nap during the rant.

1343
01:48:48,283 --> 01:48:49,683
[SPEAKER_11]: I did, because Corona makes me sleepy.

1344
01:48:49,703 --> 01:48:50,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to go club a seal.

1345
01:49:06,676 --> 01:49:07,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1346
01:49:07,137 --> 01:49:07,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1347
01:49:10,661 --> 01:49:11,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we'll be back.

1348
01:49:11,562 --> 01:49:12,463
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to take a quick break.

1349
01:49:12,483 --> 01:49:19,792
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to start off, I thought we'd start this off with Echoes from Nightstyle, so those of you that were listening to Loki's remix before can kind of hear what he had changed and all that stuff.

1350
01:49:20,253 --> 01:49:21,254
[SPEAKER_11]: And then some other stuff.

1351
01:49:21,655 --> 01:49:23,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Something from Guitar Freaks, something else from Nightstyle.

1352
01:49:24,058 --> 01:49:24,979
[SPEAKER_11]: We will be back.

1353
01:49:27,995 --> 01:49:29,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Oops, I have to say really fast.

1354
01:49:29,696 --> 01:49:29,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1355
01:49:30,657 --> 01:49:34,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Send your FUs of the week now because we're doing that when we come back in our chat room.

1356
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:37,603
[SPEAKER_11]: www.calibermoney.com Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.

1357
01:49:38,243 --> 01:49:38,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's try that again.

1358
01:49:39,044 --> 01:49:39,925
[SPEAKER_11]: Dragoon with Echoes.

1359
01:51:47,988 --> 01:51:50,249
Music Music Music Music

1360
01:52:21,744 --> 01:52:22,785
Thank you for watching!

1361
01:55:09,369 --> 01:55:17,955
[SPEAKER_00]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

1362
01:55:18,055 --> 01:55:23,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1363
01:55:24,580 --> 01:55:28,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello everybody, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, we hope you're having a good time listening.

1364
01:55:28,523 --> 01:55:31,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Episode number 63 in progress, we're going to get to the FUs of the week, but first...

1365
01:55:33,312 --> 01:55:36,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Some quick station housekeeping announcements and things like that.

1366
01:55:36,494 --> 01:55:43,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a reminder, we do have other shows here on Orange Lounge Radio now on Monday nights at 7 o'clock.

1367
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:51,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Me, Vanilla Sky is the show, and Rice Princess and Lanky Style also come over and visit, and Loki makes cameos all the time.

1368
01:55:52,547 --> 01:55:56,370
[SPEAKER_11]: And we talk about game news and then other stuff going on.

1369
01:55:56,430 --> 01:56:01,014
[SPEAKER_11]: And tomorrow night's show, I will make my official endorsement for California Governor.

1370
01:56:01,054 --> 01:56:01,935
[SPEAKER_11]: And since my initial...

1371
01:56:02,515 --> 01:56:03,396
[SPEAKER_11]: The answer is... Unicron.

1372
01:56:20,049 --> 01:56:21,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie, what's on Tuesdays?

1373
01:56:21,530 --> 01:56:24,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Tuesday is Pump Up the Volume, which is my request show.

1374
01:56:24,512 --> 01:56:26,854
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're hanging out in the chat room, make a request.

1375
01:56:26,974 --> 01:56:30,176
[SPEAKER_03]: You might hear what you want played, because I have tons and tons and tons of MP3s.

1376
01:56:30,777 --> 01:56:35,900
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's where I basically hold up my hand, extend the middle finger toward the RIAA.

1377
01:56:39,369 --> 01:57:08,841
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm thinking of breaking out, I picked up the soundtrack for Initial D Special Stage Which is the PS2 Initial D game And I might play some stuff off of that Oh great, Nostylan's going to want to make love to you for that one He's been saying Eurobeat randomly in the chatroom for like the past three days Eurobeat, Eurobeat, more Eurobeat Then probably before the show we should, you know, send him the gift of a plastic keyboard cover Yes, that's probably a good idea

1378
01:57:09,696 --> 01:57:10,838
[SPEAKER_11]: and maybe a blow-up doll.

1379
01:57:12,259 --> 01:57:13,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1380
01:57:13,601 --> 01:57:13,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Next.

1381
01:57:14,422 --> 01:57:17,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Wednesday nights, there's nothing right now.

1382
01:57:18,027 --> 01:57:20,310
[SPEAKER_11]: And Thursday nights, Livewire's on hiatus until November.

1383
01:57:21,090 --> 01:57:21,311
Right.

1384
01:57:21,912 --> 01:57:23,554
[SPEAKER_11]: That is correct.

1385
01:57:24,094 --> 01:57:25,957
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on break.

1386
01:57:26,619 --> 01:57:29,962
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm building a cabinet and I need extra days.

1387
01:57:31,103 --> 01:57:33,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, working on something else for 2004.

1388
01:57:34,606 --> 01:57:41,052
[SPEAKER_11]: I like to call it the SC2K4 project, which only I think one other person knows about.

1389
01:57:42,233 --> 01:57:45,116
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's going to be very, very complex if I pull it off.

1390
01:57:46,892 --> 01:57:49,033
[SPEAKER_11]: That's something to look forward to in 2004.

1391
01:57:49,694 --> 01:57:54,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, something else to look forward to in about one month, Orange Lounge Radio is going to be upping the stream quality.

1392
01:57:55,116 --> 01:57:57,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't worry, modem listeners will not be shut out.

1393
01:57:58,197 --> 01:58:19,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Modem listeners will still be able to connect as always, and it's going to be great, because the music is going to sound, if you have the correct codec loaded into Winamp, and if you don't, it's okay, the station will still play, it won't sound as good, but it'll still sound better than it does now even, but it's going to play DSL quality radio on a 56k stream, so it'll be really nice for some of you guys.

1394
01:58:19,996 --> 01:58:22,518
[SPEAKER_11]: That's in about one month, as soon as Live365 gets all their...

1395
01:58:25,458 --> 01:58:28,900
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also extending another kick to the 23rd Magus.

1396
01:58:32,002 --> 01:58:32,942
[SPEAKER_03]: For being stupid.

1397
01:58:34,803 --> 01:58:35,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1398
01:58:36,884 --> 01:58:37,304
[SPEAKER_11]: There it is.

1399
01:58:38,945 --> 01:58:45,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so now I think, Jamie, it's your turn to take the stage and give us some rants.

1400
01:58:45,529 --> 01:58:46,169
[SPEAKER_11]: How's that sound?

1401
01:58:46,249 --> 01:58:46,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1402
01:58:47,670 --> 01:58:47,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Oops.

1403
01:59:02,216 --> 01:59:07,038
[SPEAKER_03]: My first FU of the week goes toward this fan for blowing dust directly up my nose.

1404
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:14,921
[SPEAKER_03]: The next one goes to my house for being dirty because I work all the time.

1405
01:59:15,722 --> 01:59:21,364
[SPEAKER_03]: So we cleaned the house today and my allergies wanted to, you know, murder me through my nose.

1406
01:59:22,543 --> 01:59:24,985
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to be dead, but I took a shower instead.

1407
01:59:26,426 --> 01:59:29,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Another one goes toward Corona and Apple Juice for making me burpy.

1408
01:59:30,269 --> 01:59:32,530
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the sparkling apple juice, which is the best stuff in the world.

1409
01:59:34,452 --> 01:59:39,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Another F you goes toward all the stupid people that were on the road today.

1410
01:59:39,775 --> 01:59:43,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate them all and wish that they would wreck their cars far away from me.

1411
01:59:44,779 --> 01:59:50,303
[SPEAKER_03]: And another one goes to the stinky old man in my apartment complex who walks around smoking cigars.

1412
01:59:51,574 --> 01:59:53,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Really stinky cheap cigars.

1413
01:59:54,296 --> 02:00:01,560
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing about really stinky cheap cigars is that they make me so nauseous smelling them that I have been known to throw up before.

1414
02:00:02,801 --> 02:00:03,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, very disgusting.

1415
02:00:04,481 --> 02:00:11,345
[SPEAKER_03]: So this old man stops me because I usually, you know, just sort of tuck my hand under my nose when I walk past him so I don't have to smell it.

1416
02:00:12,868 --> 02:00:14,970
[SPEAKER_03]: and he's like, hey, do you have a problem?

1417
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:16,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a problem?

1418
02:00:16,631 --> 02:00:21,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just kept walking, but next time he does that, I'm going to say, yeah, it's you and your stinky smoke, so.

1419
02:00:24,817 --> 02:00:27,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a problem with how he stinks and what I have a problem with.

1420
02:00:29,193 --> 02:00:35,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Another one goes toward my car in Meineke for misdiagnosing my car.

1421
02:00:35,076 --> 02:00:36,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Potentially it may not be the head gasket.

1422
02:00:36,777 --> 02:00:38,618
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be the valve job.

1423
02:00:39,538 --> 02:00:44,081
[SPEAKER_03]: And another F you goes to all the people who have said that they're going to sign up for my message board and haven't yet.

1424
02:00:45,561 --> 02:00:53,766
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just... It's... I don't... That's why I said the people who said they were going to sign up and didn't.

1425
02:00:55,346 --> 02:00:58,028
[SPEAKER_03]: It's... It's, uh...

1426
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:01,903
[SPEAKER_03]: roleplay.darksakura.com, sign up for it or I'll kill you.

1427
02:01:04,386 --> 02:01:05,147
[SPEAKER_03]: That was beautiful.

1428
02:01:07,349 --> 02:01:17,720
[SPEAKER_03]: And another FU goes toward not having all the information that's needed to set up a particular server for a particular game.

1429
02:01:18,641 --> 02:01:18,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

1430
02:01:20,643 --> 02:01:21,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I missed that.

1431
02:01:22,595 --> 02:01:24,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1432
02:01:24,235 --> 02:01:25,496
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next time!

1433
02:01:48,323 --> 02:01:56,852
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel to myself for mis-measuring every single aspect of everything on my DDR pads, thus making them one hell of a mismatch of pieces.

1434
02:01:57,493 --> 02:02:05,402
[SPEAKER_11]: But they still turned out okay, it's just that everything's mis-measured and sticking out in places and stuff like that that shouldn't be.

1435
02:02:08,775 --> 02:02:31,387
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to old people because you drive too slow and you should die F you to DMV for not sending me my tags yet because I got pulled over by a cop who was saying that my registration was expired but then after checking with his little dispatcher found out that my registration wasn't expired so that's pulling me over for no reason but he was nice about it and didn't write me a ticket like the guy last year

1436
02:02:33,268 --> 02:02:41,252
[SPEAKER_11]: and then F you to all the women that are saying Arnold Schwarzenegger molested them in some way.

1437
02:02:41,532 --> 02:02:42,993
[SPEAKER_11]: You know you wanted a piece of that.

1438
02:02:43,493 --> 02:02:45,094
[SPEAKER_11]: You know you did.

1439
02:02:45,514 --> 02:02:46,695
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a big hunky guy.

1440
02:02:46,735 --> 02:02:48,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't tell me you didn't want any of that.

1441
02:02:49,936 --> 02:02:54,778
[SPEAKER_11]: You're just mad now that he's becoming a political figure and you're not with that.

1442
02:02:55,179 --> 02:02:56,039
[SPEAKER_11]: So don't be a hater.

1443
02:02:56,379 --> 02:02:57,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't be a hater.

1444
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:04,342
[SPEAKER_11]: And don't tell me that this stuff isn't totally just because he's going to win the election.

1445
02:03:04,602 --> 02:03:14,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that's why you're coming out a few days before like, Oh, I just now got the courage to tell you guys that he molested me or touched my ass or something like that.

1446
02:03:15,365 --> 02:03:23,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever, like, it's like a big coincidence, like, we don't know this, and Davis is like, oh, I didn't pay these people at all to say this stuff, not at all.

1447
02:03:24,774 --> 02:03:31,500
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so F you to them, and, um, F you to, um, Roy, because you got mauled by a tiger, and you know what?

1448
02:03:34,018 --> 02:03:38,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe if you weren't like, you know, such, you know.

1449
02:03:38,263 --> 02:03:40,766
[SPEAKER_11]: The tiger was jealous because you weren't showing it any love.

1450
02:03:40,846 --> 02:03:43,810
[SPEAKER_11]: You were loving the other lions and tigers and bears, oh my.

1451
02:03:44,231 --> 02:03:44,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my.

1452
02:03:47,691 --> 02:03:51,794
[SPEAKER_11]: See, the tiger just couldn't understand why you like the small penis but not the big penis.

1453
02:03:52,035 --> 02:03:53,256
[SPEAKER_11]: So, whatever.

1454
02:03:54,657 --> 02:04:01,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, F you to Game Show Network for airing that show called Who Wants to Be the Governor of California?

1455
02:04:01,803 --> 02:04:04,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Never in my life have I seen a more retarded show.

1456
02:04:06,226 --> 02:04:10,249
[SPEAKER_11]: If anything, Mary Carey should never run for office ever.

1457
02:04:10,289 --> 02:04:13,973
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, she should just kind of disappear because no one wants to hear her talk.

1458
02:04:14,713 --> 02:04:15,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Because she's an idiot.

1459
02:04:16,261 --> 02:04:17,262
[SPEAKER_11]: A complete idiot.

1460
02:04:17,702 --> 02:04:18,242
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?

1461
02:04:18,582 --> 02:04:20,243
[SPEAKER_11]: This is why I think she should win.

1462
02:04:20,643 --> 02:04:25,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I would like, at this point, to see California just crash and burn.

1463
02:04:26,006 --> 02:04:30,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the big, um, space shuttle crash earlier, you know?

1464
02:04:31,529 --> 02:04:38,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's just like... Just... Just burn.

1465
02:04:38,833 --> 02:04:41,414
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to see it go down and just die.

1466
02:04:41,914 --> 02:04:43,695
[SPEAKER_11]: California just needs to die.

1467
02:04:44,235 --> 02:04:44,556
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?

1468
02:04:45,656 --> 02:04:51,998
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, oh yeah, F you to, um, the government for actually searching for weapons of mass destruction.

1469
02:04:52,778 --> 02:04:53,698
[SPEAKER_11]: You ain't gonna find them.

1470
02:04:56,239 --> 02:04:58,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop wasting, just, just cop to it.

1471
02:04:58,739 --> 02:05:03,260
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we didn't like, we made up that there were, you know, weapons of mass destruction.

1472
02:05:03,440 --> 02:05:04,060
[SPEAKER_11]: So what are you gonna do?

1473
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:05,921
[SPEAKER_11]: We already destroyed them and now we're rebuilding them.

1474
02:05:05,941 --> 02:05:07,241
[SPEAKER_11]: Get over it.

1475
02:05:07,421 --> 02:05:14,883
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, F you to the fact that, like, um, I can't vote on the recall thing because I didn't re-register.

1476
02:05:15,464 --> 02:05:15,964
[SPEAKER_11]: That sucks.

1477
02:05:18,086 --> 02:05:29,474
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to certain websites out there, maybe Flamani related, that have little flash or shockwave animations that play MUSIC WHEN YOU GO TO THEIR GODDAMN SITE!

1478
02:05:29,635 --> 02:05:32,757
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna say this every week until you fucking turn that shit off.

1479
02:05:33,257 --> 02:05:35,099
[SPEAKER_11]: No one wants to hear it, it's annoying.

1480
02:05:35,599 --> 02:05:36,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Turn it off.

1481
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:38,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Your little flash animation?

1482
02:05:38,501 --> 02:05:38,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.

1483
02:05:39,222 --> 02:05:39,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Music?

1484
02:05:39,702 --> 02:05:40,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Not cool.

1485
02:05:42,184 --> 02:05:43,325
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I'm done.

1486
02:05:45,283 --> 02:05:45,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Finally.

1487
02:05:48,644 --> 02:05:49,505
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to sports.

1488
02:05:50,245 --> 02:05:50,785
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care.

1489
02:05:52,586 --> 02:05:53,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do the rest of you?

1490
02:05:55,106 --> 02:05:57,907
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to Dave and Buster's because everything's so expensive there.

1491
02:05:57,947 --> 02:06:00,488
[SPEAKER_11]: And you kicked everyone out at 10.30 that was under 18.

1492
02:06:01,068 --> 02:06:02,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Or, I mean, under 21.

1493
02:06:02,209 --> 02:06:02,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1494
02:06:03,389 --> 02:06:04,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Over 18, but under 21.

1495
02:06:04,909 --> 02:06:06,070
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, screw that.

1496
02:06:06,130 --> 02:06:06,710
[SPEAKER_11]: We were there.

1497
02:06:06,770 --> 02:06:07,870
[SPEAKER_11]: We were their escorts.

1498
02:06:07,930 --> 02:06:09,151
[SPEAKER_11]: We were their parents for the evening.

1499
02:06:09,191 --> 02:06:10,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Why you gotta kick them out?

1500
02:06:10,391 --> 02:06:11,311
[SPEAKER_11]: They weren't drinking.

1501
02:06:12,052 --> 02:06:12,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of them weren't.

1502
02:06:14,730 --> 02:06:15,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1503
02:06:35,498 --> 02:06:36,539
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's pretty much it.

1504
02:06:36,579 --> 02:06:37,479
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have a lot of FUs.

1505
02:06:37,619 --> 02:06:38,540
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to the recall.

1506
02:06:39,921 --> 02:06:41,902
[SPEAKER_11]: I just can't wait until this whole stupid thing is over.

1507
02:06:41,942 --> 02:06:43,323
[SPEAKER_11]: It should never happen in the first place.

1508
02:06:45,104 --> 02:06:48,246
[SPEAKER_11]: And FU to cell phones going off mid-show.

1509
02:06:48,687 --> 02:06:49,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Just kidding.

1510
02:06:50,028 --> 02:06:50,408
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kidding.

1511
02:06:50,748 --> 02:06:51,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, come on, Aaron.

1512
02:06:53,089 --> 02:06:53,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Yours does it all the time.

1513
02:06:54,170 --> 02:06:54,651
[SPEAKER_11]: So does mine.

1514
02:06:55,111 --> 02:06:55,611
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kidding.

1515
02:07:00,524 --> 02:07:11,428
[SPEAKER_11]: OFU to Walmart, Target, and the bookstore, and Ralph's, and the paper store in the Folsom Outlets because none of them carry giant birthday cards.

1516
02:07:11,989 --> 02:07:14,409
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm too lazy to go all the way to Sunrise Mall.

1517
02:07:15,830 --> 02:07:20,512
[SPEAKER_11]: You people need to be more practical and think about my needs because the world revolves around me.

1518
02:07:23,493 --> 02:07:23,733
Thank you.

1519
02:07:25,074 --> 02:07:25,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, I'm done.

1520
02:07:25,754 --> 02:07:27,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's hear from the rest of the room, shall we?

1521
02:07:27,595 --> 02:07:28,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Starting with

1522
02:07:29,110 --> 02:07:30,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Dare I say it, Jonas.

1523
02:07:43,427 --> 02:07:48,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Tick Tock Tick Tock Victor, my name is not meant to be written in late, so stop it.

1524
02:07:51,333 --> 02:07:53,575
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, fuck the IAA.

1525
02:07:54,435 --> 02:07:54,996
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely.

1526
02:07:55,556 --> 02:07:57,878
[SPEAKER_13]: No one wants to pay $20 for your shit.

1527
02:07:58,378 --> 02:08:00,560
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on, we've downloaded MP3s for a reason.

1528
02:08:01,381 --> 02:08:03,642
[SPEAKER_13]: To just try and see if it's a good music and all.

1529
02:08:06,605 --> 02:08:08,506
[SPEAKER_13]: Who wants to spend $20 for sucky songs?

1530
02:08:12,611 --> 02:08:13,452
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, exactly.

1531
02:08:15,273 --> 02:08:17,575
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1532
02:08:17,775 --> 02:08:19,676
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck some pigeons, try to shit on my car.

1533
02:08:21,397 --> 02:08:23,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I have to clean it up and shit.

1534
02:08:24,435 --> 02:08:26,135
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw some dog trying to lick my balls off.

1535
02:08:26,315 --> 02:08:33,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I have to ask, what were you doing with your balls exposed to a dog so they can lick them?

1536
02:08:34,077 --> 02:08:38,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I was outside, um, running, and suddenly some dog tried chasing me.

1537
02:08:38,738 --> 02:08:43,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, it's not cheating if you put peanut, smear peanut butter all over your balls and have a dog lick it off.

1538
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:46,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Ballpark.

1539
02:08:46,580 --> 02:08:47,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that show.

1540
02:08:53,923 --> 02:08:54,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Let Jonas finish, Aaron.

1541
02:08:55,144 --> 02:08:56,144
[SPEAKER_13]: He's not going to cut you off.

1542
02:08:56,164 --> 02:08:57,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't cut him off.

1543
02:08:57,305 --> 02:08:57,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Good job, Jonas.

1544
02:08:57,945 --> 02:08:59,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody give Jonas a hand.

1545
02:08:59,386 --> 02:08:59,646
[SPEAKER_13]: Good job.

1546
02:08:59,666 --> 02:09:00,307
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how to do it.

1547
02:09:00,327 --> 02:09:00,487
[SPEAKER_13]: Good job.

1548
02:09:00,507 --> 02:09:03,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, Aaron, your turn.

1549
02:09:23,227 --> 02:09:26,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess Greg and Claudio agree on me with this.

1550
02:09:26,489 --> 02:09:27,570
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to math homework.

1551
02:09:27,890 --> 02:09:33,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots and lots and lots of math homework and we have a test in like a week, unfortunately.

1552
02:09:33,974 --> 02:09:34,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Goddamn midterm.

1553
02:09:36,416 --> 02:09:42,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, FU to stinky people who play Initial D. Or it's that particular large, fat...

1554
02:09:44,358 --> 02:09:49,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Nerdy-looking, smelly guy that beat Claudia at initial D. She knows who I'm talking about.

1555
02:09:49,502 --> 02:09:57,208
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the equivalent of one of those really, really fat, like, glasses-wearing anime nerds who take Japanese just to figure out what they're saying.

1556
02:09:57,708 --> 02:09:59,149
[SPEAKER_02]: You can watch their anime episodes.

1557
02:09:59,589 --> 02:10:00,410
[SPEAKER_14]: Et cetera, et cetera.

1558
02:10:02,972 --> 02:10:04,393
[SPEAKER_02]: And... let's see...

1559
02:10:05,089 --> 02:10:16,271
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to Sean Davis of ECS30, who's not teaching us any programming, who is going straight through everything and not actually teaching, because I don't know anything about programming.

1560
02:10:17,012 --> 02:10:18,612
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah, I think that's it.

1561
02:10:19,392 --> 02:10:25,113
[SPEAKER_02]: And, oh, and FU to, um, FU to Nosan for Parra in IRC.

1562
02:10:25,473 --> 02:10:26,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Parra is dead!

1563
02:10:27,994 --> 02:10:28,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Get over it!

1564
02:10:29,614 --> 02:10:32,255
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the one Bomani game nobody was playing in Miggle yesterday.

1565
02:10:33,715 --> 02:10:38,697
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to make Paras once I get my controller and get it running in Step Mania.

1566
02:10:38,717 --> 02:10:40,237
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to make Paras for Mac 300.

1567
02:10:40,597 --> 02:10:43,599
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to work on my X-rated Para game.

1568
02:10:46,119 --> 02:10:46,940
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd play that.

1569
02:10:48,040 --> 02:10:49,881
[SPEAKER_09]: I will bring Para back single-handedly.

1570
02:10:50,381 --> 02:10:51,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Or double-handedly.

1571
02:10:52,222 --> 02:10:53,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Double-handedly depending on the technique.

1572
02:10:56,485 --> 02:11:05,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, see, it's not that I hate all these little freaks saying that, oh, it's going to come back, it's going to come back.

1573
02:11:05,712 --> 02:11:06,813
[SPEAKER_02]: We're playing for fun.

1574
02:11:06,873 --> 02:11:08,934
[SPEAKER_02]: God, it's not a fucking community anymore.

1575
02:11:10,135 --> 02:11:11,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm done.

1576
02:11:11,656 --> 02:11:12,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, one more real quick.

1577
02:11:12,537 --> 02:11:13,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me squeeze in there.

1578
02:11:16,490 --> 02:11:28,357
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to this really crappy movie, The Oral Adventures of Kraven Moorhead, number 17, because it was really dumb, and I just wasted my time watching it.

1579
02:11:28,797 --> 02:11:29,657
[SPEAKER_11]: It was hilarious, I guess.

1580
02:11:30,338 --> 02:11:31,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another one to put in.

1581
02:11:32,059 --> 02:11:37,162
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to Workload57 for being the most boring and shittiest class on all of Earth.

1582
02:11:37,242 --> 02:11:38,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to die now!

1583
02:11:39,583 --> 02:11:39,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Bradley!

1584
02:11:39,843 --> 02:11:42,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait up.

1585
02:11:44,933 --> 02:11:49,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you to the job market and being evil and stuff like that.

1586
02:11:49,814 --> 02:11:54,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you to waiting to find out if I got a job or not.

1587
02:11:55,416 --> 02:11:58,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you for being discouraged that I probably won't.

1588
02:11:59,457 --> 02:12:01,798
[SPEAKER_08]: That I didn't do well enough or something.

1589
02:12:02,718 --> 02:12:04,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, what else?

1590
02:12:04,159 --> 02:12:09,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you to... Let's see, what else?

1591
02:12:09,200 --> 02:12:12,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you to squandering my money for...

1592
02:12:12,918 --> 02:12:17,519
[SPEAKER_08]: being lazy for way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way too long.

1593
02:12:18,940 --> 02:12:22,941
[SPEAKER_08]: And fuck you to stupid Americans who don't know math and hate math homework.

1594
02:12:23,321 --> 02:12:23,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Math rules!

1595
02:12:29,122 --> 02:12:32,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I was a math major and chemistry.

1596
02:12:33,623 --> 02:12:34,663
[SPEAKER_08]: I like, yes, well.

1597
02:12:34,683 --> 02:12:39,125
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because I'm lazy, that's not because I know math.

1598
02:12:39,145 --> 02:12:39,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Zing!

1599
02:12:42,939 --> 02:12:43,660
[SPEAKER_08]: I can do anything!

1600
02:12:43,980 --> 02:12:51,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, he's been able to stay unemployed this whole time because he knows finance, thanks to that.

1601
02:12:52,587 --> 02:12:57,752
[SPEAKER_11]: He knows how to budget out those unemployment or whatever, however he's doing it, so... There you go.

1602
02:12:57,772 --> 02:12:58,953
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have never been on unemployment.

1603
02:13:00,154 --> 02:13:01,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we don't need to get into personal life.

1604
02:13:01,555 --> 02:13:03,737
[SPEAKER_08]: I would actually wish I would have gotten onto it, like, sometime.

1605
02:13:03,757 --> 02:13:08,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I'm not a student anymore.

1606
02:13:19,986 --> 02:13:25,491
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to interject something here, think freely Roy, the show is probably going to be cancelled forever.

1607
02:13:25,872 --> 02:13:26,192
[SPEAKER_05]: YES!

1608
02:13:32,218 --> 02:13:34,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Will you please tell that to everybody, Nelly?

1609
02:13:36,468 --> 02:13:39,789
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like the world to hear the wisdom of Nellie here because she makes a good point.

1610
02:13:39,849 --> 02:13:40,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1611
02:13:41,270 --> 02:13:42,010
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot it already.

1612
02:13:42,290 --> 02:13:43,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright puppy, your turn.

1613
02:13:45,471 --> 02:13:48,453
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to begin by saying fuck you to the following ionic compounds.

1614
02:13:48,733 --> 02:13:53,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Silver sulfide, Stano-sulfate... DO NOT BRING CHEMISTRY ON TO THIS PROGRAM!

1615
02:13:55,355 --> 02:14:00,637
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to... Okay, I'm... I'm sitting here working on this fucking chemistry homework right now!

1616
02:14:00,897 --> 02:14:02,678
[SPEAKER_10]: It's... That's how bad it is!

1617
02:14:03,658 --> 02:14:05,599
[SPEAKER_10]: It just fucked chemistry all together.

1618
02:14:06,240 --> 02:14:09,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I hate having to do busy work like this.

1619
02:14:10,502 --> 02:14:11,643
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not helping me any.

1620
02:14:13,183 --> 02:14:18,926
[SPEAKER_10]: I still have to do, uh, one, two, three... A good four more pages worth of writing chemical formulas.

1621
02:14:19,607 --> 02:14:20,087
[SPEAKER_10]: For homework.

1622
02:14:21,718 --> 02:14:21,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1623
02:14:22,919 --> 02:14:26,122
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's annoying and it's a pain in the ass and yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda.

1624
02:14:27,383 --> 02:14:28,224
[SPEAKER_10]: And, let's see here.

1625
02:14:29,645 --> 02:14:37,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, I, fuck any, fuck all non-working ATMs in the city of Davis, which is the large majority of ATMs.

1626
02:14:38,892 --> 02:14:44,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, the People's Republic of, I actually took that real life comic and put it up as my desktop picture on my computer.

1627
02:14:44,917 --> 02:14:47,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Davis made famous by real life this week, that comic.

1628
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:51,241
[SPEAKER_11]: The guy who draws us from the same town we are.

1629
02:14:55,862 --> 02:15:06,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck the people at the UC Davis arcade for taking way too fucking long to go through applications for jobs because it's been a month since I turned in my application and they still haven't reviewed it yet.

1630
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:12,281
[SPEAKER_10]: I noticed this theme of lazy employers tonight.

1631
02:15:12,301 --> 02:15:13,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, really now?

1632
02:15:14,661 --> 02:15:18,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Because actually, there's an EV Games opening today, so I'm going to go apply for a job there, too.

1633
02:15:21,763 --> 02:15:23,664
[SPEAKER_12]: Poppy's going to work for the enemy of Jamie.

1634
02:15:23,744 --> 02:15:24,884
[SPEAKER_12]: I have no enemies.

1635
02:15:25,865 --> 02:15:26,705
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't make enemies.

1636
02:15:28,305 --> 02:15:30,246
[SPEAKER_12]: Can't we all just get along?

1637
02:15:30,266 --> 02:15:33,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I have another one that I provide.

1638
02:15:34,787 --> 02:15:38,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's like you just whoever made Murder Burger changed their name.

1639
02:15:38,601 --> 02:15:44,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as cool as it is to have Red Rum Burger, it was so cool to have Murder Burger.

1640
02:15:44,242 --> 02:15:45,103
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to go eat there.

1641
02:15:45,263 --> 02:15:48,223
[SPEAKER_11]: On the right side, we just found out there's a Red Rum Burger in Folsom.

1642
02:15:49,204 --> 02:15:50,324
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to go there for one night.

1643
02:15:50,424 --> 02:15:53,905
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't had Murder Burgers yet because it's on Sutter Street.

1644
02:15:55,745 --> 02:16:03,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to answer, puppy, I wanted red meat because I really wanted a hamburger.

1645
02:16:04,247 --> 02:16:06,928
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't eat beef anymore and I can't really digest it very well.

1646
02:16:07,679 --> 02:16:08,980
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I had an ostrich burger.

1647
02:16:09,820 --> 02:16:10,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Ostrich sounds... strange.

1648
02:16:11,061 --> 02:16:11,681
[SPEAKER_03]: It's yummy.

1649
02:16:11,862 --> 02:16:12,402
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really yummy.

1650
02:16:14,403 --> 02:16:15,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, um, who's next?

1651
02:16:19,406 --> 02:16:20,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Helen?

1652
02:16:21,327 --> 02:16:26,590
[SPEAKER_02]: F you go to, uh, TapX Tads in Davis, because we opened them up, what, Friday night?

1653
02:16:27,291 --> 02:16:30,813
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found the cool... we found enough soil to pot a plant.

1654
02:16:32,174 --> 02:16:32,874
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

1655
02:16:33,274 --> 02:16:33,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah!

1656
02:16:34,975 --> 02:16:39,138
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that bad, so yeah, F you to TapX for never seeing this happen.

1657
02:16:42,761 --> 02:16:44,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, F you to the minions, Dark.

1658
02:16:44,482 --> 02:16:51,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's move on to chatroom F you, shall we?

1659
02:16:51,967 --> 02:16:52,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, less.

1660
02:16:53,709 --> 02:16:55,430
[SPEAKER_11]: And we will comment on them and make fun of them.

1661
02:16:55,890 --> 02:17:00,493
[SPEAKER_11]: AZN Buddy Paul says, F you to schoolwork and F you to negativity.

1662
02:17:00,594 --> 02:17:01,034
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

1663
02:17:04,844 --> 02:17:12,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Chaos would like to say, F you to Love is Drowning, original soundtrack version from Nightstyle, because the singing makes my ears bleed.

1664
02:17:13,188 --> 02:17:14,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a Politary song?

1665
02:17:15,229 --> 02:17:15,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1666
02:17:17,570 --> 02:17:20,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we need to play that new Politary song that Loki found a little later.

1667
02:17:21,252 --> 02:17:24,614
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we'll save that for next week, or maybe we'll do it when we come back after F yous.

1668
02:17:26,634 --> 02:17:32,195
[SPEAKER_11]: Baka would like to say, my FU of the week goes to initial D players of Riptide for being such pains in the asses.

1669
02:17:32,635 --> 02:17:37,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Bastards hog the machine and hog the F-Zero machine and call it the initial D on crack.

1670
02:17:37,716 --> 02:17:40,276
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't know shit about F-Zero and why do they play it?

1671
02:17:40,336 --> 02:17:42,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the machine gives out free cards.

1672
02:17:42,217 --> 02:17:42,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Bastards.

1673
02:17:43,137 --> 02:17:44,477
[SPEAKER_11]: VH2 would like to respond to you.

1674
02:17:45,177 --> 02:17:46,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, tell us something we don't know.

1675
02:17:46,797 --> 02:17:47,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on now.

1676
02:17:48,438 --> 02:17:53,759
[SPEAKER_13]: Every time I go here, it's like all the same things.

1677
02:17:55,279 --> 02:17:55,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1678
02:17:56,582 --> 02:18:00,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Ninst would like to say F you to the entirety of my college physics department.

1679
02:18:01,103 --> 02:18:03,904
[SPEAKER_11]: All the professors have a different thing wrong with them and none of them can teach.

1680
02:18:06,165 --> 02:18:07,425
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the same thing at every school.

1681
02:18:08,805 --> 02:18:12,486
[SPEAKER_11]: 23rd Magus would like to say F you to being sick right before a job interview.

1682
02:18:13,367 --> 02:18:14,707
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to midterms being this week.

1683
02:18:14,947 --> 02:18:18,908
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to being too broke to afford a communications book to study for said midterms.

1684
02:18:19,108 --> 02:18:25,050
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, you need to actually look past where you're applying and apply somewhere else.

1685
02:18:27,080 --> 02:18:30,741
[SPEAKER_11]: and FU to looking at the wrong page during an oral assignment.

1686
02:18:31,561 --> 02:18:35,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Prompting the teacher to ask me if I knew the difference between Niko and Inu.

1687
02:18:35,302 --> 02:18:37,222
[SPEAKER_11]: One page had a cat in the picture, the other had a dog.

1688
02:18:37,723 --> 02:18:41,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Look lady, teach us to count in Japanese before you call out page numbers in Japanese.

1689
02:18:45,464 --> 02:18:49,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Marin would like to say, oh by the way, Marin made a, she made a funny earlier.

1690
02:18:49,445 --> 02:18:52,346
[SPEAKER_11]: She said, Siegfried's been mauled by a tiger before.

1691
02:18:52,726 --> 02:18:55,627
[SPEAKER_11]: If they stop sleeping with the tigers, they might not get mauled so much.

1692
02:18:58,103 --> 02:18:59,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Marin would like to say, here be my F.U.

1693
02:18:59,924 --> 02:19:00,304
[SPEAKER_11]: of the week.

1694
02:19:01,825 --> 02:19:02,045
[SPEAKER_11]: F.U.

1695
02:19:02,085 --> 02:19:04,366
[SPEAKER_11]: to the financial aid office of the local college.

1696
02:19:04,466 --> 02:19:08,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, they didn't distribute any of my financial aid money to any of my classes.

1697
02:19:08,549 --> 02:19:16,153
[SPEAKER_11]: So I got a lovely letter in the mail yesterday from the administration office saying that I have to tell the temp to pay for all my classes, otherwise I'll be removed from all of them.

1698
02:19:17,273 --> 02:19:20,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you guys would listen... No, no, no, because I can actually comment on this one.

1699
02:19:20,934 --> 02:19:21,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1700
02:19:22,415 --> 02:19:24,776
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to the financial aid office at the local college.

1701
02:19:25,056 --> 02:19:28,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently they didn't distribute any of my financial aid money to any of my classes.

1702
02:19:28,857 --> 02:19:35,519
[SPEAKER_11]: So I got a lovely letter in the mail yesterday from the administration office saying that I have until the 10th to pay for all my classes, otherwise I'd be removed from all of them.

1703
02:19:35,819 --> 02:19:40,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Speak to the director of financial aid if they won't help you contact the Department of Education and turn their asses in.

1704
02:19:42,184 --> 02:19:44,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Straight to Jamie's mouth.

1705
02:19:44,086 --> 02:19:44,626
[SPEAKER_03]: She's listening.

1706
02:19:44,706 --> 02:19:46,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I work for student loans.

1707
02:19:46,928 --> 02:19:48,590
[SPEAKER_03]: You talk to the department.

1708
02:19:49,071 --> 02:19:53,495
[SPEAKER_03]: If the school is not going to work with you, if the school does direct lending, contact the Department of Education.

1709
02:19:53,575 --> 02:19:56,157
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, find out who your lender is and contact them.

1710
02:19:56,858 --> 02:19:57,759
[SPEAKER_03]: They can work with the school.

1711
02:19:59,260 --> 02:20:00,622
[SPEAKER_11]: And Maren says, yes, ma'am.

1712
02:20:01,002 --> 02:20:01,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my goodness.

1713
02:20:02,782 --> 02:20:03,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1714
02:20:04,322 --> 02:20:06,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I will tell her that, well, I'll tell you.

1715
02:20:06,823 --> 02:20:11,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow I will send you an IM with the Department of Education's 800 number.

1716
02:20:13,585 --> 02:20:14,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Maren says, yes, ma'am.

1717
02:20:15,466 --> 02:20:16,206
[SPEAKER_11]: She's on that.

1718
02:20:16,266 --> 02:20:16,566
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1719
02:20:17,587 --> 02:20:20,988
[SPEAKER_11]: And F you to Rick for not straightening out issues with our old apartment complex.

1720
02:20:21,048 --> 02:20:22,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks to him not correcting them.

1721
02:20:22,848 --> 02:20:27,049
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm being sued for reg for the last month we were there, even though we weren't there the whole month.

1722
02:20:27,189 --> 02:20:27,670
[SPEAKER_11]: End rants.

1723
02:20:27,710 --> 02:20:28,290
[SPEAKER_11]: K, thanks.

1724
02:20:28,370 --> 02:20:28,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

1725
02:20:32,409 --> 02:20:32,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving on.

1726
02:20:34,032 --> 02:20:40,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Dork would like to say F you to Counter-Strike for having so many hackers that can rip your freaking head off from the starting point.

1727
02:20:41,901 --> 02:20:46,023
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to work for not letting me off early so I can go home and listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

1728
02:20:46,544 --> 02:20:50,306
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here today because I asked for off to go to a friend's birthday.

1729
02:20:51,166 --> 02:20:53,648
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to my car because I don't know what the fuck is wrong with it.

1730
02:20:54,388 --> 02:20:58,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Now my chances of going to Mobile, Alabama for their tournament is slim.

1731
02:20:59,531 --> 02:21:00,712
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to my saving habits.

1732
02:21:01,172 --> 02:21:09,197
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to my DDR private attacking because it all... If there's a tournament next month, I'm going to be in Mobile next month.

1733
02:21:11,363 --> 02:21:15,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, DarkSakura, you need to cover the Tournament Mobile for us.

1734
02:21:15,186 --> 02:21:16,608
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my freaking hometown, I'll do it.

1735
02:21:16,628 --> 02:21:17,528
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to research that.

1736
02:21:17,909 --> 02:21:19,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Get in contact with Dork.

1737
02:21:19,610 --> 02:21:21,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Dork, email our station.

1738
02:21:21,692 --> 02:21:25,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually in the chat room, even though I'm technically not there because I'm logged in at home.

1739
02:21:25,836 --> 02:21:29,239
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, SSF, that's me, send me a PM with the details.

1740
02:21:29,459 --> 02:21:30,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Dork, do that.

1741
02:21:31,100 --> 02:21:32,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1742
02:21:32,201 --> 02:21:34,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Dork would also like to say F you to the Saints for losing again.

1743
02:21:37,186 --> 02:21:38,127
[SPEAKER_03]: So what else is new?

1744
02:21:40,572 --> 02:21:50,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Tao would like to say F you to my roommates for monopolizing the PS2 with Disgaea and then taking the GTA and my sacred FFTA from me.

1745
02:21:50,202 --> 02:21:52,604
[SPEAKER_11]: Which, if I remember, didn't he mooch that from somebody else?

1746
02:21:52,924 --> 02:21:54,306
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe so!

1747
02:21:54,346 --> 02:21:55,968
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, would you like to respond, puppy?

1748
02:21:58,123 --> 02:21:58,323
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1749
02:21:58,623 --> 02:21:58,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1750
02:21:59,223 --> 02:22:01,885
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've had this horrible urge to play Parappa 2 lately.

1751
02:22:04,926 --> 02:22:05,226
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1752
02:22:07,967 --> 02:22:11,989
[SPEAKER_11]: In all seriousness, he says, F you to, well, shit, this was a good week for me.

1753
02:22:12,149 --> 02:22:13,669
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to not having much to bitch at.

1754
02:22:13,689 --> 02:22:16,230
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a good feeling.

1755
02:22:16,430 --> 02:22:17,031
[SPEAKER_11]: No silence.

1756
02:22:17,091 --> 02:22:18,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop parrying in the chat room.

1757
02:22:19,252 --> 02:22:20,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of no silence...

1758
02:22:25,929 --> 02:22:46,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Screw people that drive slow, F you for people that wear transparent shoes, F you for not having 40 cent days at McDonald's, F you to Comcast, F you to my car which has been dead for three months, F you to people that play Warcraft 3 all day and have nothing better to do, F you to expensive Goosh paint, I don't know, what the hell is that?

1759
02:22:47,128 --> 02:22:48,509
[SPEAKER_11]: Does any artist here know what that is?

1760
02:22:48,609 --> 02:22:52,032
[SPEAKER_11]: G-H-O-U-C-E, Goosh, I don't know.

1761
02:22:54,349 --> 02:22:54,869
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never heard of it.

1762
02:22:55,950 --> 02:23:02,333
[SPEAKER_11]: They come in these small 2.4 ounces and cost $6 to $9, and they get used up after a single project.

1763
02:23:02,493 --> 02:23:03,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job, Skye and Jamie.

1764
02:23:04,194 --> 02:23:04,454
[SPEAKER_11]: On what?

1765
02:23:04,494 --> 02:23:04,834
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1766
02:23:05,534 --> 02:23:06,175
[SPEAKER_07]: It says good job.

1767
02:23:06,615 --> 02:23:08,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we rock.

1768
02:23:11,197 --> 02:23:12,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Loki, you just suck.

1769
02:23:12,618 --> 02:23:13,258
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm just kidding.

1770
02:23:14,338 --> 02:23:15,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1771
02:23:15,739 --> 02:23:16,379
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, I don't know.

1772
02:23:16,399 --> 02:23:17,960
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to respond to No Silent?

1773
02:23:19,341 --> 02:23:19,641
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1774
02:23:22,819 --> 02:23:28,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, PDR Mike would like to say, F you to the drunk Mexican who showed me his ding-a-ling last week.

1775
02:23:28,943 --> 02:23:30,443
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1776
02:23:33,585 --> 02:23:35,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Mike, if you hadn't looked so interested.

1777
02:23:37,107 --> 02:23:39,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Just kidding, just kidding.

1778
02:23:39,989 --> 02:23:44,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Dork says that the tournament is on November 1st in Mobile, Alabama.

1779
02:23:44,791 --> 02:23:46,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell him to private message me his details.

1780
02:23:46,853 --> 02:23:50,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's actually probably the day I'm flying in.

1781
02:23:57,609 --> 02:23:59,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and there's lots of typing going on.

1782
02:24:00,470 --> 02:24:02,671
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm relaying the message as she says, yes ma'am.

1783
02:24:03,031 --> 02:24:10,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, no, but, um, if it's on the first then I likely can't attend because it's the day I'm planning on flying in unless I can fly in the day before.

1784
02:24:11,634 --> 02:24:12,434
[SPEAKER_03]: So just give me details.

1785
02:24:14,355 --> 02:24:20,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I need details, times, locations, is it at, you know, cyber station or what, let me know.

1786
02:24:20,817 --> 02:24:22,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that's it for the FQs of the week.

1787
02:24:23,658 --> 02:24:24,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Finally.

1788
02:24:24,159 --> 02:24:24,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1789
02:24:26,284 --> 02:24:28,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, oh, Aaron, Aaron would like to say something to you all?

1790
02:24:30,086 --> 02:24:36,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Baka, um, I know you like PETA, but stop advertising it in the chat for the goddamn last time.

1791
02:24:37,248 --> 02:24:38,109
[SPEAKER_02]: How many times do I have to say this?

1792
02:24:38,149 --> 02:24:39,229
[SPEAKER_02]: PETA is dead!

1793
02:24:40,189 --> 02:24:40,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeez.

1794
02:24:41,830 --> 02:24:42,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Until I bring it back.

1795
02:24:44,011 --> 02:24:48,352
[SPEAKER_11]: No styling says, DJ, that's good job, for Loki.

1796
02:24:48,973 --> 02:24:50,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't know who he or she is.

1797
02:24:56,101 --> 02:24:57,922
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll tell you here.

1798
02:24:58,262 --> 02:25:00,683
[SPEAKER_11]: NoSilent says, um, GJ for Loki.

1799
02:25:01,023 --> 02:25:02,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't know who he or she is.

1800
02:25:04,024 --> 02:25:04,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job.

1801
02:25:04,664 --> 02:25:05,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job.

1802
02:25:05,924 --> 02:25:07,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't know who he or she is.

1803
02:25:09,305 --> 02:25:09,746
[SPEAKER_11]: It's alright.

1804
02:25:10,466 --> 02:25:10,886
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care.

1805
02:25:12,046 --> 02:25:14,467
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't even paying attention.

1806
02:25:15,047 --> 02:25:15,968
[SPEAKER_11]: He's kind of shaking a little bit.

1807
02:25:15,988 --> 02:25:16,368
[SPEAKER_11]: It's alright.

1808
02:25:16,588 --> 02:25:16,968
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care.

1809
02:25:18,128 --> 02:25:18,469
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care.

1810
02:25:18,489 --> 02:25:19,009
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to kill him.

1811
02:25:19,029 --> 02:25:19,569
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care.

1812
02:25:21,940 --> 02:25:23,461
[SPEAKER_11]: See those squirrels outside?

1813
02:25:23,861 --> 02:25:25,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, my attack squirrels.

1814
02:25:26,183 --> 02:25:26,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1815
02:25:30,525 --> 02:25:31,506
[SPEAKER_11]: We know where you live!

1816
02:25:32,046 --> 02:25:40,792
[SPEAKER_11]: You do realize by tuning into the station they send you, you know, send us your address, so... Home address, you dumb shit!

1817
02:25:50,993 --> 02:25:52,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Quiet, quiet.

1818
02:25:52,274 --> 02:25:53,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Go back to your chemistry homework.

1819
02:25:59,356 --> 02:26:00,356
[SPEAKER_11]: Chemists suck.

1820
02:26:00,836 --> 02:26:01,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Be a drug dealer.

1821
02:26:05,658 --> 02:26:08,159
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like street chemistry for you.

1822
02:26:12,180 --> 02:26:13,521
[SPEAKER_11]: And it pays better anyways.

1823
02:26:15,981 --> 02:26:17,542
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, Canada is so cool.

1824
02:26:20,808 --> 02:26:22,069
[SPEAKER_03]: We should take a road trip there.

1825
02:26:23,850 --> 02:26:29,194
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, I don't know, it's like we're like the 60s and Canada is the 70s.

1826
02:26:31,095 --> 02:26:32,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Or what, wait, did the 70s suck?

1827
02:26:33,456 --> 02:26:34,397
[SPEAKER_03]: The 70s had disco.

1828
02:26:35,138 --> 02:26:36,478
[SPEAKER_03]: And remember, your disco needs you.

1829
02:26:41,942 --> 02:26:44,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I remember now why Canada rocks.

1830
02:26:44,564 --> 02:26:47,586
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they're going to start selling alcohol in movie theaters.

1831
02:26:48,587 --> 02:26:49,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going.

1832
02:26:50,167 --> 02:26:50,847
[SPEAKER_03]: I am going.

1833
02:26:51,107 --> 02:26:51,948
Drunk moviegoers.

1834
02:26:52,768 --> 02:26:53,608
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.

1835
02:26:53,628 --> 02:26:56,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Drunk moviegoers need to buy more popcorn so they can drink more.

1836
02:26:58,909 --> 02:27:03,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and FU did my work giving me Geely, which is sitting on top of my PS2 right there.

1837
02:27:04,170 --> 02:27:04,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Evil.

1838
02:27:06,790 --> 02:27:08,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Zodiac Knight wants to share something with you.

1839
02:27:08,971 --> 02:27:11,571
[SPEAKER_11]: They actually made cocaine in his organic lab.

1840
02:27:11,951 --> 02:27:13,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you wish you went to his school, puppy?

1841
02:27:14,452 --> 02:27:14,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1842
02:27:15,192 --> 02:27:15,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

1843
02:27:16,522 --> 02:27:18,063
[SPEAKER_03]: What a cool... I wouldn't make in cocaine.

1844
02:27:18,383 --> 02:27:18,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?

1845
02:27:18,924 --> 02:27:20,585
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fun and educational.

1846
02:27:22,486 --> 02:27:22,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1847
02:27:23,727 --> 02:27:24,768
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to take a quick break.

1848
02:27:24,788 --> 02:27:28,570
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to play two songs from the V-Rare 2 CD US.

1849
02:27:28,991 --> 02:27:35,275
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to play Tomorrow Perfume and I Need You, and then I'm throwing in... Oh, we'll do that.

1850
02:27:35,375 --> 02:27:36,436
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1851
02:27:36,756 --> 02:27:38,437
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll do those second and third.

1852
02:27:38,878 --> 02:27:44,882
[SPEAKER_11]: But in the meantime, if you guys enjoyed tonight's cage match winner, P8107, you might enjoy... Loki, tell them about it.

1853
02:27:46,776 --> 02:28:07,557
[SPEAKER_11]: and K8107, like I said, I don't even know what this 8107 shit is, but K8107 is a remix of Karma, so, uh, it's pretty cool, but anyway, it's also by Onuken, um, you can actually find it on his site if you search for Onuken under, um, muzy.co.jp, you can find him on there,

1854
02:28:09,209 --> 02:28:09,229
[SPEAKER_11]: K8107

1855
02:33:11,753 --> 02:33:13,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1856
02:34:03,785 --> 02:34:21,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because Bongo demands it Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio

1857
02:34:31,394 --> 02:34:32,395
[SPEAKER_11]: God, I hate that ferret.

1858
02:34:32,415 --> 02:34:33,175
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate it so much.

1859
02:34:33,196 --> 02:34:36,558
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought you guys would go one week without bringing the damn thing out, and there it is.

1860
02:34:37,199 --> 02:34:37,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Jeez.

1861
02:34:38,600 --> 02:34:40,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, shut the fuck up for a minute.

1862
02:34:40,602 --> 02:34:42,803
[SPEAKER_11]: I have some news I want to talk about here.

1863
02:34:43,264 --> 02:34:44,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Do not make me confiscate that.

1864
02:34:45,306 --> 02:34:46,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I will confiscate it.

1865
02:34:47,207 --> 02:34:48,128
[SPEAKER_11]: I will confiscate it.

1866
02:34:49,249 --> 02:34:51,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Run, puppy, run like the wind.

1867
02:34:51,210 --> 02:34:52,672
[SPEAKER_11]: I will confiscate it.

1868
02:34:53,953 --> 02:34:55,634
[SPEAKER_11]: It's even worse than confiscating.

1869
02:34:56,975 --> 02:34:58,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, this is interesting.

1870
02:34:58,557 --> 02:35:02,522
[SPEAKER_11]: I was talking and I don't remember if you were there talking with us too, Jamie.

1871
02:35:03,243 --> 02:35:07,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Mel B was talking to us yesterday while we were at Miggle about some things.

1872
02:35:08,008 --> 02:35:10,251
[SPEAKER_11]: And he works at Konami now and he was telling us a lot of interesting things.

1873
02:35:10,271 --> 02:35:13,615
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, I'm not going to repeat any of it because I don't know what can and can't be repeated.

1874
02:35:13,675 --> 02:35:16,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing, nothing, nothing to, it's nothing...

1875
02:35:18,134 --> 02:35:20,276
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing earth shattering anyway.

1876
02:35:20,357 --> 02:35:22,779
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing, so I'm not even going to go there.

1877
02:35:23,160 --> 02:35:24,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Just that I will say this.

1878
02:35:25,522 --> 02:35:29,407
[SPEAKER_11]: He says Ultra Mix looks very cool, which I'm sure it already does.

1879
02:35:29,467 --> 02:35:30,168
[SPEAKER_11]: I could have told you that.

1880
02:35:30,408 --> 02:35:31,529
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll see about that.

1881
02:35:31,830 --> 02:35:37,736
[SPEAKER_11]: But one thing I was trying to tell him, I'd asked him if he knew anything about Sony putting out a new competitive dancing game.

1882
02:35:38,277 --> 02:35:44,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Sony has released the full track listing featured in the upcoming dancing game for their iToy Peripheral.

1883
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:45,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Sony Computer Entertainment Europe...

02:36:04,469 --> 02:36:10,734
[SPEAKER_11]: is pleased to announce the 25 fully licensed music tracks that will feature in the brand new dancing game, iToy Groove.

1885
02:36:11,534 --> 02:36:23,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Released in November 2003, iToy Groove utilizes the PlayStation 2's exclusive iToy technology and gives everyone a chance to fulfill their dreams of being able to dance live on TV.

1886
02:36:24,064 --> 02:36:33,631
[SPEAKER_11]: By linking the iToy USB camera to a PlayStation 2, the players will feature live on their TV screen, enabling them to dance along with the on-screen prompts.

1887
02:36:35,017 --> 02:36:38,519
[SPEAKER_11]: The full list of artists and tracks to groove along to is as follows.

1901
02:37:51,070 --> 02:37:57,116
[SPEAKER_11]: With no complicated controls, iToy Groove is instantly accessible, even for those with no rhythm.

1902
02:37:57,176 --> 02:37:59,718
[SPEAKER_11]: So come on everybody, let's get down and groove.

1903
02:38:00,479 --> 02:38:01,060
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you guys think?

1904
02:38:04,102 --> 02:38:07,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Gee, I like motion capture dance games, because they rock.

1905
02:38:08,847 --> 02:38:13,832
[SPEAKER_11]: iToy is retarded, and if you think people look awkward playing DDR, wait until you see this.

1906
02:38:15,333 --> 02:38:16,134
[SPEAKER_11]: This is nothing.

1907
02:38:17,836 --> 02:38:24,682
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm thinking, if it's some kind of camera that's capturing your motion, I'm thinking this sounds a lot like Para to me.

1908
02:38:25,303 --> 02:38:26,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it just me or does this sound like Para?

1909
02:38:27,665 --> 02:38:29,207
[SPEAKER_11]: The reincarnation of Para.

1910
02:38:30,187 --> 02:38:31,689
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like Marshall Beat.

1911
02:38:32,830 --> 02:38:33,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm, Marshall Beat.

1912
02:38:35,132 --> 02:38:36,053
[SPEAKER_11]: So somewhere in there.

1913
02:38:37,234 --> 02:38:39,976
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you coming here to reiterate that Para is dead?

1914
02:38:39,997 --> 02:38:41,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we already know, Erin.

1915
02:38:41,178 --> 02:38:43,099
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where I pray that this one will die too.

1916
02:38:45,185 --> 02:38:47,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, please, please die!

1917
02:38:48,306 --> 02:38:50,167
[SPEAKER_02]: So Baka doesn't have another thing to rave that guy about.

1918
02:38:50,187 --> 02:38:53,428
[SPEAKER_11]: The problem with games like this is they're not going to have their own in-house music.

1919
02:38:53,848 --> 02:39:00,311
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's based off of these 25 songs, which will get old about as fast as DDR Max 2 got old.

1920
02:39:01,731 --> 02:39:06,953
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, you know what, this will be, like, good for those people who are like, Oh!

1921
02:39:08,114 --> 02:39:10,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, it's Madonna!

1922
02:39:10,395 --> 02:39:12,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, I get this game!

1923
02:39:12,295 --> 02:39:12,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Sign me up!

1924
02:39:12,956 --> 02:39:13,436
[SPEAKER_11]: That's me!

1925
02:39:15,743 --> 02:39:17,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Sign me up, I'm going out and buying this thing.

1926
02:39:17,564 --> 02:39:18,845
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to dance to music.

1927
02:39:19,085 --> 02:39:21,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Mr. DJ.

1928
02:39:22,648 --> 02:39:27,031
[SPEAKER_11]: The iToy, I mean, while a cool idea, it's just, um, no.

1929
02:39:27,751 --> 02:39:27,932
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1930
02:39:29,172 --> 02:39:29,893
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just retarded.

1931
02:39:30,313 --> 02:39:34,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's like, there's no, like, Loki's right, there's no in-house music.

1932
02:39:35,417 --> 02:39:39,680
[SPEAKER_03]: If they have Police 911 working with the iToy, then I'll purchase one of those, but that's it.

1933
02:39:41,811 --> 02:39:44,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Zodiac Knight would like to reiterate in our chat room.

1934
02:39:44,033 --> 02:39:56,138
[SPEAKER_11]: He says, and then a secret chip inside the PS2 records images of you dancing and sends them to Sony headquarters where executives sit in a large room, watch the images, and laugh at you.

1935
02:39:59,040 --> 02:39:59,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds good to me.

1936
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:00,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Kick Andrew again!

1937
02:40:00,600 --> 02:40:01,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Kick Andrew again!

1938
02:40:01,481 --> 02:40:03,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do I get to kick Andrew again?

1939
02:40:03,522 --> 02:40:06,043
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, that directive was not coming from Jamie.

1940
02:40:06,103 --> 02:40:08,164
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't do it in... Okay, Jamie said to kick him.

1941
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:25,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and to respond to AZ and Buddy Paul, it's because all the idiots that started Para decided to start drama over it, and if it comes up again, it's even more drama, and the little idiot's going, Oh no, you didn't do the routine right!

1942
02:40:25,270 --> 02:40:26,311
[SPEAKER_02]: That person knew!

1943
02:40:27,972 --> 02:40:29,193
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it needs to die!

1944
02:40:32,756 --> 02:40:33,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1945
02:40:34,938 --> 02:40:36,500
[SPEAKER_11]: As promised in this part of the show...

1946
02:40:37,600 --> 02:40:47,930
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd like to take a minute to let you take some control over the show and have us talk about any topic you want us to in a segment that we call Ask Orange Lounge.

1947
02:40:48,230 --> 02:40:51,954
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can send those questions now over private message to Sky in the chat room.

1948
02:40:52,274 --> 02:40:53,875
[SPEAKER_11]: In the meantime, let's hear the theme song.

1949
02:40:59,821 --> 02:41:01,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's Ask Orange Lounge.

1950
02:41:01,623 --> 02:41:02,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Some stupid question.

1951
02:41:03,490 --> 02:41:06,613
[SPEAKER_11]: What will we learn tonight on Ask Orange Lounge?

1952
02:41:07,174 --> 02:41:08,495
[SPEAKER_11]: What is Loki mad about?

1953
02:41:08,996 --> 02:41:10,417
[SPEAKER_11]: What is DarkSakura mad about?

1954
02:41:10,857 --> 02:41:12,499
[SPEAKER_11]: What is Sky mad about?

1955
02:41:12,659 --> 02:41:13,980
[SPEAKER_11]: The answer is probably Aaron.

1956
02:41:15,542 --> 02:41:16,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Just kidding.

1957
02:41:17,864 --> 02:41:18,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1958
02:41:23,910 --> 02:41:27,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Question number one is coming to us tonight from Baka.

1959
02:41:28,854 --> 02:41:29,915
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is a good question.

1960
02:41:29,955 --> 02:41:32,576
[SPEAKER_11]: This is my favorite question that's ever been asked in Ask Orange Lounge.

1961
02:41:33,176 --> 02:41:36,078
[SPEAKER_11]: He says, Baka says, why are you so cool, Sky?

1962
02:41:46,043 --> 02:41:49,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go over this long list of reasons that I have.

1963
02:41:51,727 --> 02:41:53,348
[SPEAKER_03]: My response is another question.

1964
02:41:53,788 --> 02:41:55,528
[SPEAKER_03]: How many jokes have you been taking tonight?

1965
02:41:56,109 --> 02:41:56,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as cool.

1966
02:41:57,529 --> 02:41:58,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, now, now.

1967
02:41:58,510 --> 02:41:59,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryan, there's no comment.

1968
02:41:59,530 --> 02:42:01,311
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd take more than that to get a piece of the cock.

1969
02:42:07,333 --> 02:42:16,656
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to say... Because, face it, everybody... I mean, we're in the 21st century now, and everybody loves the token gay guy, right?

1970
02:42:18,457 --> 02:42:20,678
[SPEAKER_11]: And not only that, but I'm a token gay guy on the radio.

1971
02:42:21,837 --> 02:42:33,659
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the token black guy, so... Loki consistently bringing this show to new lows.

1972
02:42:34,420 --> 02:42:37,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know if you listen to half the people online who've never met me in person.

1973
02:42:37,360 --> 02:42:38,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the token Asian girl.

1974
02:42:40,421 --> 02:42:46,842
[SPEAKER_11]: When the fact is that between Loki, DarkSakura, and myself, we are like the whitest people ever.

1975
02:42:49,043 --> 02:42:49,563
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, I'm...

1976
02:42:52,366 --> 02:42:55,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Who wants to respond to Zodiac Night's comment, yay for token Asians?

1977
02:42:55,487 --> 02:42:58,147
[SPEAKER_11]: I like everybody for dinner For a hundred people

1978
02:43:24,739 --> 02:43:25,079
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1979
02:43:27,001 --> 02:43:30,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Question number two tonight comes from AZN Buddy Paul.

1980
02:43:31,224 --> 02:43:32,866
[SPEAKER_11]: I already sent this in email.

1981
02:43:33,086 --> 02:43:35,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I didn't even open the Orange Lodge mailbag.

1982
02:43:35,888 --> 02:43:36,549
[SPEAKER_11]: I may have to do that.

1983
02:43:36,889 --> 02:43:38,630
[SPEAKER_11]: There's never anything in the Orange Lodge mailbag.

1984
02:43:39,531 --> 02:43:39,972
[SPEAKER_11]: But here it is.

1985
02:43:40,632 --> 02:43:46,397
[SPEAKER_11]: AZN Buddy Paul would like to know why Sunday night for this show I'm breaking rules staying up this late.

1986
02:43:47,157 --> 02:43:47,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Well...

1987
02:43:48,311 --> 02:43:51,533
[SPEAKER_11]: When Orange Lounge Radio started, I was doing double work.

1988
02:43:51,593 --> 02:44:01,060
[SPEAKER_11]: I was doing another show on Saturday night under Station Live, which is still on the air because the host moved to Texas and has some new co-hosts now under StationLive.org.

1989
02:44:01,100 --> 02:44:08,305
[SPEAKER_11]: That's on Saturday night, so it just kind of made sense to do a show on Sunday night, and that's what Jamie agreed to, and that's what Matt started showing up to.

1990
02:44:10,627 --> 02:44:12,628
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's always the rewinds.

1991
02:44:12,648 --> 02:44:12,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1992
02:44:13,409 --> 02:44:13,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1993
02:44:13,929 --> 02:44:16,130
[SPEAKER_11]: There's always the rewinds on...

1994
02:44:18,324 --> 02:44:18,824
[SPEAKER_11]: What nights?

1995
02:44:20,685 --> 02:44:21,406
[SPEAKER_11]: We keep switching them.

1996
02:44:21,446 --> 02:44:23,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Thursdays at 2 and Wednesdays at 4.

1997
02:44:24,307 --> 02:44:25,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Pacific Standard Time.

1998
02:44:25,368 --> 02:44:27,169
[SPEAKER_11]: No more Mondays because that's when Vanilla Sky is on.

1999
02:44:29,110 --> 02:44:38,634
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason why, also, I learned from doing a radio show on Saturday night, although there may be a lot of people at home who want to listen, that ruins my Saturday night.

2000
02:44:38,754 --> 02:44:42,836
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't go out and go to places like Dave and Buster's and all that stuff if you're doing a show on a Saturday.

2001
02:44:42,936 --> 02:44:44,097
[SPEAKER_11]: And my wife comes first.

2002
02:44:45,612 --> 02:44:47,933
[SPEAKER_11]: As I believe Jamie and Loki would agree to.

2003
02:44:47,993 --> 02:44:48,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you have to answer 23rd Maggie.

2004
02:44:48,973 --> 02:44:50,013
[SPEAKER_02]: She said, I am the wise person ever.

2005
02:44:51,753 --> 02:44:52,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, yeah, yeah, he's right.

2006
02:44:53,174 --> 02:44:54,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, yeah, he is right.

2007
02:44:54,214 --> 02:44:55,014
[SPEAKER_11]: He is the wise person ever.

2008
02:44:55,534 --> 02:45:00,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but, um, it is Friday, Saturday night.

2009
02:45:00,455 --> 02:45:03,176
[SPEAKER_11]: While they might be good for ratings, it just, we want to have a life.

2010
02:45:03,296 --> 02:45:06,537
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we don't go out there and get a life, we'll have nothing to talk about on this program.

2011
02:45:06,577 --> 02:45:07,197
[SPEAKER_11]: So, deal.

2012
02:45:08,444 --> 02:45:12,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, but yes, if you don't like Sunday nights, you can't always listen to the rewinds.

2013
02:45:12,385 --> 02:45:17,907
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's also original programming on Monday and Tuesday, and soon Wednesday again nights as well, so.

2014
02:45:18,487 --> 02:45:18,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2015
02:45:20,267 --> 02:45:21,047
[SPEAKER_11]: But thanks for asking.

2016
02:45:25,409 --> 02:45:29,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, 23rd Magus would like to ask, pink, purple, or teal?

2017
02:45:31,690 --> 02:45:32,390
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the question?

2018
02:45:32,410 --> 02:45:33,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, why?

2019
02:45:33,091 --> 02:45:34,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Pink, purple, or teal?

2020
02:45:34,711 --> 02:45:35,471
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the question.

2021
02:45:35,531 --> 02:45:35,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Purple.

2022
02:45:37,372 --> 02:45:37,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

2023
02:45:38,772 --> 02:45:39,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me see if I can guess.

2024
02:45:40,133 --> 02:45:43,215
[SPEAKER_11]: What color should he dye his pubes?

2025
02:45:47,157 --> 02:45:53,381
[SPEAKER_11]: I will go with purple because that might offset your hair or something.

2026
02:45:55,243 --> 02:45:55,963
[SPEAKER_11]: You're horrible.

2027
02:45:57,224 --> 02:45:59,925
[SPEAKER_03]: It would also confuse people looking for a natural color.

2028
02:46:01,787 --> 02:46:04,108
[SPEAKER_11]: We already have a pink, so maybe teal.

2029
02:46:04,148 --> 02:46:05,269
[SPEAKER_11]: You can be the artist known as teal.

2030
02:46:07,463 --> 02:46:19,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, um, 23rd Magus would also like to ask, 23rd Magus would like to ask, why do we have a gazillion ops in the chat room, but very few are on consistently?

2031
02:46:19,771 --> 02:46:21,452
[SPEAKER_11]: My answer to that is, quit op begging.

2032
02:46:22,973 --> 02:46:30,678
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think it has to do just because we cycle in and out, we're all on at different times, except for Puppy, who has no life.

2033
02:46:31,379 --> 02:46:31,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh,

2034
02:46:32,779 --> 02:46:35,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Angel's on almost all the time at some obscene hours of the day.

2035
02:46:35,842 --> 02:46:36,863
[SPEAKER_11]: DT's on there a lot.

2036
02:46:37,263 --> 02:46:37,703
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2037
02:46:37,743 --> 02:46:40,946
[SPEAKER_11]: We might make new ops later, but we'll think about it.

2038
02:46:41,867 --> 02:46:42,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2039
02:46:42,368 --> 02:46:47,652
[SPEAKER_11]: When you get more people in the chatroom, and I mean you, not specifically at the question house, but you as in our chatroom.

2040
02:46:47,672 --> 02:46:47,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Our listeners.

2041
02:46:48,113 --> 02:46:51,696
[SPEAKER_11]: When you, the listener, get more people in the chatroom consistently, then we'll make new ops.

2042
02:46:52,176 --> 02:46:52,857
[SPEAKER_11]: How's that sound?

2043
02:46:54,038 --> 02:46:56,560
[SPEAKER_11]: And plus, you guys are just so good and don't cause trouble.

2044
02:46:56,800 --> 02:46:57,981
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we don't need a lot of ops.

2045
02:46:58,322 --> 02:46:58,742
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.

2046
02:47:00,925 --> 02:47:02,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Who needs a big at sign anyway?

2047
02:47:02,966 --> 02:47:04,367
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a pain in the ass.

2048
02:47:06,249 --> 02:47:07,329
[SPEAKER_03]: It validates who I am.

2049
02:47:07,810 --> 02:47:09,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Dork has a question for Jamie.

2050
02:47:09,771 --> 02:47:10,071
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2051
02:47:10,712 --> 02:47:12,993
[SPEAKER_11]: When are you going to be in Mobile?

2052
02:47:13,073 --> 02:47:15,855
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can get the time off of work, it's going to be the 1st through the 15th.

2053
02:47:18,177 --> 02:47:18,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Fair enough.

2054
02:47:20,140 --> 02:47:24,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Next question, Greg Ismasa would like to know, what's for dinner?

2055
02:47:25,081 --> 02:47:27,081
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if he's asking what we had for dinner tonight.

2056
02:47:27,121 --> 02:47:28,401
[SPEAKER_11]: How about Chef Aaron explain?

2057
02:47:28,461 --> 02:47:32,922
[SPEAKER_02]: He's asking me, because he's treated me out before for food, so I kind of owe him dinner.

2058
02:47:34,402 --> 02:47:34,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

2059
02:47:34,563 --> 02:47:35,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Mystery meat.

2060
02:47:36,443 --> 02:47:38,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, answer the question I asked.

2061
02:47:38,143 --> 02:47:39,363
[SPEAKER_11]: What did we have tonight?

2062
02:47:39,403 --> 02:47:40,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell that to our show.

2063
02:47:40,103 --> 02:47:46,865
[SPEAKER_02]: We had shredded, or well, chopped up cabbage into strips with pork, and in Jamie's case, chicken, because she can't eat pork.

2064
02:47:47,125 --> 02:47:47,685
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had rice.

2065
02:47:48,185 --> 02:47:48,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Always a staple.

2066
02:47:53,203 --> 02:47:53,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Yummy.

2067
02:47:54,124 --> 02:47:54,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

2068
02:47:55,425 --> 02:47:58,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Puppy, do you have your hand up or are you just dangling the ferret by its balls?

2069
02:48:00,429 --> 02:48:07,796
[SPEAKER_03]: The ferrets are joined like, for people who live in the south, you'll recognize these, like the little love bugs.

2070
02:48:08,637 --> 02:48:09,998
[SPEAKER_03]: You say, oh, well they're joined.

2071
02:48:10,058 --> 02:48:10,719
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so pretty.

2072
02:48:10,779 --> 02:48:11,499
[SPEAKER_03]: They're fucking.

2073
02:48:12,300 --> 02:48:14,342
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like cat talk, but it's ferret, ferret.

2074
02:48:17,139 --> 02:48:23,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, the thing is that if you catch the two bugs together and make a wish about the person you love and let them go, then it's happy.

2075
02:48:24,024 --> 02:48:29,128
[SPEAKER_03]: But all that you do is you catch them and damage their wings and then they die while they're fucking.

2076
02:48:32,971 --> 02:48:34,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, moving on.

2077
02:48:34,652 --> 02:48:39,916
[SPEAKER_02]: For Greg, mystery meat does not actually include regular cattle meat.

2078
02:48:39,996 --> 02:48:42,798
[SPEAKER_02]: It could include other meat, cough, cough, human meat, cough, cough.

2079
02:48:45,726 --> 02:48:46,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, moving on.

2080
02:48:47,047 --> 02:48:49,728
[SPEAKER_12]: EvilNauki... Are you okay?

2081
02:48:51,169 --> 02:48:52,030
[SPEAKER_11]: Boys, what are you doing?

2082
02:48:52,270 --> 02:48:53,351
[SPEAKER_03]: The ferrets turned lethal.

2083
02:48:53,771 --> 02:48:54,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2084
02:48:55,612 --> 02:48:58,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Next question comes to us from EvilNauki2DX.

2085
02:48:59,674 --> 02:49:06,178
[SPEAKER_11]: EvilNauki2DX would like to know, okay, why do people start drama over games like Initial D?

2086
02:49:06,258 --> 02:49:06,858
[SPEAKER_11]: What the fuck?

2087
02:49:06,898 --> 02:49:09,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people have no lives and have nothing else to do.

2088
02:49:10,526 --> 02:49:16,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people at certain arcades, cough, cough, just think it's fun and because they have, yeah, they have no lives.

2089
02:49:17,028 --> 02:49:20,848
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they think in order to have a life, you can start drama over other people's lives.

2090
02:49:20,868 --> 02:49:22,689
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody has a life and everybody has drama.

2091
02:49:23,029 --> 02:49:23,409
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

2092
02:49:23,689 --> 02:49:24,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do people watch soap operas?

2093
02:49:25,029 --> 02:49:29,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that these are people who use video games to validate their sense of self-worth.

2094
02:49:29,650 --> 02:49:30,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Here is my...

2095
02:49:32,236 --> 02:49:35,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's my answer, my 100% serious answer to this question.

2096
02:49:36,119 --> 02:49:40,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Any group that you do participate in is going to have drama.

2097
02:49:40,843 --> 02:49:46,527
[SPEAKER_11]: You hear about theater drama, or football drama, or whatever you're doing, there's drama.

2098
02:49:46,747 --> 02:49:53,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Because when you get people together, they've got personality clashes up the ass going on, and there's drama.

2099
02:49:53,452 --> 02:49:54,173
[SPEAKER_11]: So it doesn't matter.

2100
02:49:54,333 --> 02:49:58,156
[SPEAKER_11]: An issue D has drama just as bad as DDR, or any game.

2101
02:50:00,834 --> 02:50:03,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Greg, that's funny that you get your ass kicked by cats.

2102
02:50:05,237 --> 02:50:05,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, moving on.

2103
02:50:07,799 --> 02:50:08,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas, sorry.

2104
02:50:10,561 --> 02:50:12,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Stupid people exist, so what to expect?

2105
02:50:13,443 --> 02:50:15,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Fair enough.

2106
02:50:15,324 --> 02:50:22,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though I'll be 2DX, I'd also like to know, may I call you, this will be a question towards me, may I call you Robby Punz from now on?

2107
02:50:23,029 --> 02:50:24,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Or Robby Pums.

2108
02:50:24,550 --> 02:50:25,151
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you may not.

2109
02:50:25,551 --> 02:50:27,072
[SPEAKER_11]: But you may call me Sexy Rob.

2110
02:50:27,292 --> 02:50:28,273
[SPEAKER_11]: That is permissible.

2111
02:50:29,835 --> 02:50:30,795
[SPEAKER_11]: or the Pharaoh King, yes.

2112
02:50:33,656 --> 02:50:40,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is it, another question from EvilNaukiTDX, why is it that PT Cruisers follow me around whenever I am outdoors?

2113
02:50:41,598 --> 02:50:44,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, are you just attracting things that suck lately?

2114
02:50:44,939 --> 02:50:46,060
[SPEAKER_11]: They want to tap your ass.

2115
02:50:49,801 --> 02:50:54,242
[SPEAKER_11]: 23rd Magus would like to say, he'd like to clarify the pink, purple and teal question.

2116
02:50:54,862 --> 02:50:57,063
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the M&M's poll, you dumbass.

2117
02:50:58,348 --> 02:51:02,471
[SPEAKER_11]: I would also like to say the M&M's poll ended about six months ago, you dumbass.

2118
02:51:07,375 --> 02:51:10,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that like a little anecdote in his five-page joke book?

2119
02:51:11,198 --> 02:51:11,798
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe so.

2120
02:51:11,858 --> 02:51:12,439
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the foreword.

2121
02:51:12,479 --> 02:51:13,099
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the epilogue.

2122
02:51:13,820 --> 02:51:14,740
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the fifth page.

2123
02:51:16,261 --> 02:51:19,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Dork would like to say, tournament will be all day.

2124
02:51:19,144 --> 02:51:20,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Just come whenever you come in.

2125
02:51:20,445 --> 02:51:22,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Chances are we'll still be there the November 1st thing.

2126
02:51:22,926 --> 02:51:24,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them you may have a special guest then.

2127
02:51:24,848 --> 02:51:25,028
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2128
02:51:28,746 --> 02:51:30,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Zodiac Knight has a question.

2129
02:51:32,209 --> 02:51:30,327
1.

2130
02:51:32,289 --> 02:51:33,990
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, will you marry me?

2131
02:51:35,331 --> 02:51:38,773
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd have to go against Dan, and Dan is 6'4".

2132
02:51:38,853 --> 02:51:40,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that if he stepped on you, you'd be dead.

2133
02:51:41,195 --> 02:51:41,555
[SPEAKER_03]: So, no.

2134
02:51:43,496 --> 02:51:47,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and Tac's my other man, and then there's my mistress, Margaret Cho.

2135
02:51:48,060 --> 02:51:48,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2136
02:51:49,221 --> 02:51:51,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, he had a backup plan here.

2137
02:51:51,142 --> 02:51:53,123
[SPEAKER_11]: He says, if not, question 2.

2138
02:51:53,243 --> 02:51:54,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Sky, will you marry me?

2139
02:51:56,646 --> 02:51:56,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you 18?

2140
02:52:00,816 --> 02:52:03,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I hate it when 17 year olds ask me this question, I hate it.

2141
02:52:06,961 --> 02:52:09,643
[SPEAKER_11]: 23rd Magus, what the fuck are you fucking doing?

2142
02:52:09,683 --> 02:52:10,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Robby Pums!

2143
02:52:10,964 --> 02:52:13,606
[SPEAKER_11]: 23rd Magus would like to know, can we call you Boo Boo Kitty Fuck?

2144
02:52:15,067 --> 02:52:16,068
[SPEAKER_11]: No, and be original.

2145
02:52:21,111 --> 02:52:21,512
[SPEAKER_12]: Richie?

2146
02:52:23,373 --> 02:52:24,594
[SPEAKER_12]: You may not call me Robby Pums.

2147
02:52:24,734 --> 02:52:26,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you can call him Richie Poo.

2148
02:52:26,195 --> 02:52:29,118
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I can call you, I can call you Boo Boo Kitty Fuck, Richie Poo.

2149
02:52:34,296 --> 02:52:36,517
[SPEAKER_11]: I could, but I love him too much to kick him.

2150
02:52:37,938 --> 02:52:39,660
[SPEAKER_11]: EvilNauki2DX has a question for DarkSakura.

2151
02:52:39,680 --> 02:52:41,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you kick 23rd Magus instead?

2152
02:52:41,861 --> 02:52:43,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, I'll kick... You know what?

2153
02:52:43,823 --> 02:52:44,223
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

2154
02:52:44,263 --> 02:52:47,846
[SPEAKER_11]: What I will do, I will kick 23rd Magus instead of kicking EvilNauki2DX.

2155
02:52:59,209 --> 02:52:59,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that was easy.

2156
02:53:02,430 --> 02:53:02,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2157
02:53:08,851 --> 02:53:09,731
[SPEAKER_03]: That was beautiful.

2158
02:53:10,052 --> 02:53:10,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2159
02:53:10,532 --> 02:53:11,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it again.

2160
02:53:11,492 --> 02:53:12,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a rerun.

2161
02:53:12,612 --> 02:53:13,312
[SPEAKER_11]: You want a rerun?

2162
02:53:13,552 --> 02:53:13,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2163
02:53:16,113 --> 02:53:17,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's syndicate this.

2164
02:53:18,474 --> 02:53:20,374
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the kicking 23rd Megas the show.

2165
02:53:23,535 --> 02:53:23,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2166
02:53:24,055 --> 02:53:25,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that's enough abuse.

2167
02:53:25,815 --> 02:53:26,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2168
02:53:27,236 --> 02:53:28,816
[SPEAKER_11]: No more abusing the freshman, you guys.

2169
02:53:30,779 --> 02:53:31,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Fresh Meat.

2170
02:53:32,020 --> 02:53:32,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, next question.

2171
02:53:33,682 --> 02:53:34,563
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're out of questions.

2172
02:53:35,004 --> 02:53:35,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Ask us questions.

2173
02:53:35,605 --> 02:53:36,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, wait.

2174
02:53:36,085 --> 02:53:36,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is.

2175
02:53:37,026 --> 02:53:39,189
[SPEAKER_11]: EvilNalgy2DX has a question for DarkSakura.

2176
02:53:39,349 --> 02:53:39,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2177
02:53:39,990 --> 02:53:41,551
[SPEAKER_11]: When are you coming to San Francisco again?

2178
02:53:42,472 --> 02:53:46,757
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when someone pays for me to go to San Francisco.

2179
02:53:48,318 --> 02:53:48,899
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2180
02:53:49,039 --> 02:53:57,645
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually want to go on a Saturday, but Dan and I are completely redoing our apartment, throwing out crap and stuff.

2181
02:53:58,205 --> 02:54:12,014
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe when I get back from Alabama, I might set out a special Saturday if I'm not sick from all the uber-thick cigarette smoke.

2182
02:54:12,435 --> 02:54:14,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, 23rd Magus, you are a target.

2183
02:54:14,376 --> 02:54:17,058
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, big, bright red bullseye painted on your ass.

2184
02:54:18,530 --> 02:54:21,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Big white target with the bright red bull's eye painted on the ground.

2185
02:54:21,213 --> 02:54:21,994
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is so white.

2186
02:54:22,835 --> 02:54:26,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so that means that I can go to him to buy my deodorant.

2187
02:54:26,720 --> 02:54:27,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2188
02:54:29,941 --> 02:54:31,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Nevermind, I'll go to Walmart.

2189
02:54:31,342 --> 02:54:34,163
[SPEAKER_11]: 23rd Magus says, will you have extra medical supplies tomorrow?

2190
02:54:34,203 --> 02:54:34,763
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll need them.

2191
02:54:35,063 --> 02:54:36,563
[SPEAKER_11]: He's directing that towards me because he's coming.

2192
02:54:36,823 --> 02:54:44,926
[SPEAKER_11]: He wants to guest on Vanilla Sky tomorrow because he believes that he can play video game trivia to bad music and keep the volume at 5%.

2193
02:54:46,087 --> 02:54:51,749
[SPEAKER_11]: He's challenging me to own him at a video game trivia to bad music.

2194
02:54:51,829 --> 02:54:52,549
[SPEAKER_11]: So we shall see.

2195
02:54:55,598 --> 02:55:01,620
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, Brad kept it at only 15% last week while Rice Princess went to 65% You know I don't like that Huh?

2196
02:55:01,740 --> 02:55:07,082
[SPEAKER_11]: You know I don't at it Well, why don't you put your money where your mouth is?

2197
02:55:07,182 --> 02:55:23,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have to freaking wash the sheets on my bed tomorrow You know, you can come clean up my bedroom if you want to I don't really want to Okay then My sheets smell like Shermie's butt right now because she slept on my bed

2198
02:55:25,629 --> 02:55:30,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so I think now's a good time for us to close up the old mailbag for Ask Orange Law.

2199
02:55:30,714 --> 02:55:32,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh wait, actually I should check the email bag real fast.

2200
02:55:33,857 --> 02:55:39,322
[SPEAKER_11]: In the meantime, will Jamie please entertain us with a song and dance while I open up the mailbag?

2201
02:55:43,065 --> 02:55:44,947
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm never asking her to do this again.

2202
02:55:52,347 --> 02:56:00,232
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the horrendous sexual acts of two stuffed ferrets with a little voice box inside of them.

2203
02:56:01,854 --> 02:56:08,058
[SPEAKER_11]: The email box is orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com, all one word, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

2204
02:56:09,079 --> 02:56:13,542
[SPEAKER_11]: We just got that same question from Paul that says, why are the shows on Sunday?

2205
02:56:14,102 --> 02:56:16,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Sunday night, people have to get ready to go back to school or work.

2206
02:56:16,944 --> 02:56:19,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we get any questions asking if we wanted enlarged penises?

2207
02:56:21,211 --> 02:56:22,071
[SPEAKER_11]: In the mailbox, no.

2208
02:56:23,052 --> 02:56:24,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it, I've always wanted a larger penis!

2209
02:56:36,516 --> 02:56:39,057
[SPEAKER_11]: For those people who didn't see it before, there's the pad.

2210
02:56:39,557 --> 02:56:40,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Number one finished.

2211
02:56:40,818 --> 02:56:40,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah!

2212
02:56:41,518 --> 02:56:42,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Webcam slipping.

2213
02:56:43,419 --> 02:56:43,839
[SPEAKER_11]: There it is.

2214
02:56:44,239 --> 02:56:44,839
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's not bent.

2215
02:56:44,879 --> 02:56:45,740
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a camera lens.

2216
02:56:49,281 --> 02:56:49,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Ain't it pretty?

2217
02:56:51,864 --> 02:56:52,845
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very nice.

2218
02:56:53,305 --> 02:56:57,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I'm still amazed by how many things are built out of wood out here.

2219
02:57:14,150 --> 02:57:15,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Who was the biggest bitch?

2220
02:57:15,971 --> 02:57:17,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Send your votes right now.

2221
02:57:17,813 --> 02:57:19,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Just kidding, just kidding.

2222
02:57:19,614 --> 02:57:20,815
[SPEAKER_11]: If you vote, you'll get kicked.

2223
02:57:21,035 --> 02:57:21,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2224
02:57:22,656 --> 02:57:24,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2225
02:57:25,799 --> 02:57:26,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2226
02:57:31,383 --> 02:57:35,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so it's about time to wrap up the show, you guys.

2227
02:57:35,686 --> 02:57:36,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Wrap it up in ribbons and bows.

2228
02:57:36,987 --> 02:57:37,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Wrap it up in ribbons and bows.

2229
02:57:37,968 --> 02:57:39,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Wrap it up in straps and buckles.

2230
02:57:41,570 --> 02:57:42,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Before...

2231
02:57:43,931 --> 02:57:46,652
[SPEAKER_11]: We put the lid on the coffin of the show.

2232
02:57:46,672 --> 02:57:48,653
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2233
02:57:48,713 --> 02:57:49,753
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's start off with Aaron.

2234
02:57:50,654 --> 02:57:51,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Violent Hyper Girl.

2235
02:57:54,195 --> 02:57:54,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Drama sucks.

2236
02:57:55,396 --> 02:57:57,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Para is not meant for a community.

2237
02:57:58,117 --> 02:57:58,557
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

2238
02:58:02,719 --> 02:58:04,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Jonas, final thought.

2239
02:58:05,180 --> 02:58:07,561
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I forgot to mention this before.

2240
02:58:07,721 --> 02:58:09,361
[SPEAKER_13]: I was thinking about running a tournament in January.

2241
02:58:09,842 --> 02:58:10,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Booked for January.

2242
02:58:11,986 --> 02:58:17,894
[SPEAKER_13]: So if anyone wants to contact me about this tournament, just go to drfreak.com on the Visionaries Forum.

2243
02:58:19,056 --> 02:58:27,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh fuck, just go to AIM or just email me, that's all.

2244
02:58:28,143 --> 02:58:29,664
[SPEAKER_09]: or go to that site you hoarded out earlier.

2245
02:58:30,045 --> 02:58:35,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm online like 24-7, so I-M-E at sillyfobbygirl, G-U-R-L.

2246
02:58:36,029 --> 02:58:41,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Fobby is F-O-B-B-Y, and then I'll just forward it to Jonas, because occasionally you're online, right?

2247
02:58:41,954 --> 02:58:42,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2248
02:58:42,614 --> 02:58:44,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, occasionally he's online, so, yeah.

2249
02:58:50,661 --> 02:58:50,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2250
02:58:54,531 --> 02:58:55,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Bradley, your final thought, please.

2251
02:58:56,291 --> 02:58:58,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I so hope I get a job soon, soon.

2252
02:58:59,593 --> 02:59:00,854
[SPEAKER_08]: The Doom is closing in.

2253
02:59:03,235 --> 02:59:04,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Puppy, your final thought?

2254
02:59:04,856 --> 02:59:06,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Chemistry sucks at the end.

2255
02:59:07,197 --> 02:59:07,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well put.

2256
02:59:09,959 --> 02:59:11,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Who hasn't gone yet?

2257
02:59:11,199 --> 02:59:12,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Just the three of us?

2258
02:59:12,900 --> 02:59:13,241
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki!

2259
02:59:16,162 --> 02:59:19,464
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, for all you trainables out there, it's the middle hole.

2260
02:59:24,283 --> 02:59:26,685
[SPEAKER_11]: My final thought is stay tuned for the afterbirth tonight.

2261
02:59:26,725 --> 02:59:27,365
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be great.

2262
02:59:29,366 --> 02:59:35,449
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is I need some money and I need a maid to clean my house for me.

2263
02:59:36,710 --> 02:59:37,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a house.

2264
02:59:37,990 --> 02:59:38,511
[SPEAKER_03]: A big one.

2265
02:59:38,971 --> 02:59:39,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a compound.

2266
02:59:39,831 --> 02:59:40,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a castle.

2267
02:59:42,893 --> 02:59:43,533
[SPEAKER_03]: With a moat.

2268
02:59:44,614 --> 02:59:46,335
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to have our own gated community.

2269
02:59:46,415 --> 02:59:47,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that idea.

2270
02:59:47,155 --> 02:59:48,456
[SPEAKER_07]: The Orange Lounge gated community.

2271
02:59:49,696 --> 02:59:53,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that link posted is wrong, because Jonas screwed up.

2272
02:59:54,537 --> 02:59:56,738
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad, my bad.

2273
02:59:56,938 --> 02:59:59,039
[SPEAKER_02]: It's G-A-M-E, not N-E.

2274
03:00:01,880 --> 03:00:04,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, thank you.

2275
03:00:04,760 --> 03:00:10,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Final word of the show tonight will go to... Whoa, I don't think Puppy's ever had it, so let's give it to Puppy.

2276
03:00:11,102 --> 03:00:11,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Nomenclature.

2277
03:00:14,463 --> 03:00:15,604
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have the outro queued up.

2278
03:00:18,636 --> 03:00:20,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for listening and supporting Orange Lounge Radio Puppy, nomenclature

2279

[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

[SPEAKER_07]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2283
03:00:50,347 --> 03:00:55,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here I am in my tubby again, and my tubby's all filled with water and nice fluffy suds.

2284
03:00:55,571 --> 03:00:58,133
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've got my soap and washcloth to wash myself.

2285
03:00:58,614 --> 03:01:01,576
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've got my nifty scrub brush to help me scrub my back.

2286
03:01:02,177 --> 03:01:05,179
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've got a big fluffy towel to dry myself when I'm done.

2287
03:01:05,760 --> 03:01:09,583
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's one other thing that makes tubby time the very best time of the whole day.

2288
03:01:10,143 --> 03:01:11,184
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you know what that is?
