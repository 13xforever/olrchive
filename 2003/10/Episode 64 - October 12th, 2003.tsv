214912	219095	Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
222717	227641	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, where Monty talks and then some.
228321	231063	Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.
231423	235486	Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.
236087	240870	Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.
241502	245264	You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
245564	247025	Yes, I will spank your child.
247426	249187	If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.
253989	256091	Well, here's to my big opening.
256631	257752	A sphincter says what?
258032	260033	I'm super, thanks for asking.
260413	263035	Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.
263055	264396	What am I doing here?
264416	265376	Dodge this.
265436	265696	Mm-hmm.
268755	270615	This is a tasty burger.
270836	273316	Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.
273556	274196	Yes, I have.
274576	276457	Look, just a flesh wound.
276677	282958	Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.
283919	284759	Oh, yeah?
284859	288240	Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.
288440	289460	DarkSakura.
289720	290660	I've had a Smith.
290860	291420	Sky.
291500	293641	But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.
294001	294481	Loki.
294761	295821	I hate you.
296181	298202	Orange Lounge Radio Arts.
300925	302405	We are live!
303265	306246	This is episode number 64 for October the 12th of 2003.
306306	314308	You're tuned in to the Beemani-themed, most cream-filled station of all things Beemani.
314408	315528	That's full of suck.
315748	318309	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Skye.
319249	321009	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
321029	323430	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers.
323470	324790	You know her better as DarkSakura.
324890	328611	Never eat reduced-fat oatmeal cream cookies, because they suck.
328651	329871	We'll get into that in a little while.
332599	335582	Also with us tonight, say hello to our tech master, Loki.
335602	336702	Hi.
337723	338244	How are you?

344449	349913	Starting off with... Surprise me.
351134	351514	Someone.
351854	352955	Hi, Bradley.
353015	353676	How are you doing?
354436	358379	I have faced the evil reduced fat cookie of death and I have survived.
358760	360241	And all I got was this crappy t-shirt.
363205	365245	Also, let's say hello to 23rd Magus.
365405	370447	I really need to stop listening to Travis, because every time I see you, you're always like, I'm gay!
372247	372667	Shut up.
373328	379309	I know, remind me to save that sound clip for the next intro, whenever we introduce Andrew.
386113	388155	We'll be talking to everybody more a little bit later.
388255	389715	We have a lot of news to talk about.
390156	396259	DDR Extreme, where Matt's arcade cabinet stands.
396879	398620	Orange Lounge Radio goes to the movies.
399661	400641	And plenty more.
400962	401802	I actually went to the movies, too.
401982	402522	When we come back.
402542	405564	Yeah, I went to the movies, too, actually.
405944	406244	Did you?
406805	408065	Did you see the same movie we all saw?
408085	408726	Yes, yes, I did.
409406	410767	Well, then you get to talk with us.
411451	412612	That movie owns my soul.
412652	413352	We'll be back.
413372	413872	Don't spoil it.
413892	414893	And part of my intestines.
414913	415653	We'll be back.
416514	418795	First, we're going to play a song from the new V-Rare album.
418955	420696	It's a long version of Drop Ta-Bomb.
421837	425018	And we'll hear Un De Trois from Max Extreme.
425038	426079	Watch your mouth.
426579	427760	I called it Max Extreme.
428120	430141	From DDR Extreme Consumer.
430241	430501	What?
430662	430962	Like 1, 2, 3?

636156	637938	Actdeft meets Ecstasy
667834	674276	Mr. Random Person on the street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge being on a music and more show?
674296	674636	The music?
697555	703578	It's like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
703918	705919	It's unearthly.
706139	709880	It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
711221	713462	Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
713542	717404	Hope you enjoyed that.
718784	720565	And drop the bomb, the long mix.
721789	725432	from the V-Rare album, the brand new one that just came out with DDR Extreme in Japan.
725612	727453	I think you broke the camera with that cookie.
727493	727793	Shut up.
728053	740002	If you're wondering what happened to the Orange Lounge Radio DDR Extreme premiere show, well, I ordered my copy of Extreme a little later than some of you, and therefore we won't be getting it until Tuesday.
740022	741083	I forgot to order mine.
741183	743284	So we won't be doing the show until Wednesday.
743504	744965	Oops, because I'm going to Alabama.
746106	746386	Yeah.
746586	747827	Wait, when do you leave for Alabama?
748328	748768	Next month.
749301	749641	Next month.
749681	750642	We're still a little ways away.
750882	751863	But I had to buy my ticket.
752043	755845	We just did the math, though, and you're going to be missing episode 69, which makes me cry.
756506	758867	Unless you put us on hiatus.
760008	761509	Put the show on hiatus, never.
763290	765251	Hey, we want to go to Golfland on Sunday.
765371	767473	Well, let's just pre-record the show.
768493	770255	No, we don't want the show on hiatus.
770455	771315	Remember those days.
773277	774697	I will pick my replacement.
775498	776619	Oh, you're going to handpick a replacement?
776639	777799	I will pick my replacement.
778140	778400	Oh, okay.
783687	784968	Just be gentle while you're picking.
786369	788031	Yeah, right.
788871	790553	I'll break out the asbestos gloves.
792895	799520	Yes, I originally had told our chat room earlier in the week, for those of you guys that lurk in our chat room 24-7, get a life.
799620	800161	No, just kidding.
800181	800621	Just kidding.
800661	800981	We love it.
802322	810309	I did say originally Monday because I thought that's what day I was going to get it, but I actually checked the UPS thing and it's not going to get here until Tuesday because UPS is slower than I remember.
810734	812275	And it takes two days to get here, not one.
812335	814136	So we are actually going to be getting it on Tuesday.
814676	817117	But because of Jamie's show, we're not going to play it until Wednesday.
817218	819639	So that's when the DDR Extreme premiere show will be.
819659	820399	It will be Wednesday.
821120	823621	Not much of a premiere, I know, because many of you have already played it.
823701	827343	But I know a lot of you guys don't have access to Japanese PlayStation 2s.
827423	828924	And maybe you're a little curious about the game.
828944	835747	Because details have been a little... Details about the new DDR Extreme... You know, all the stuff we really want to know about has come out.
835807	836708	What are the hidden songs?
837028	837809	What do they sound like?
837829	838609	What are the non-stop versions?
839188	843909	All little things haven't really been talked about, so we'll be doing that on our webcam as well.
843929	845289	We have the TV hooked up to the webcam.
845729	852171	The little things, the cool things, the information mode things that we can't read, but will be funny anyway, I'm sure.
853531	853951	Yay.
854291	856152	You're supposed to promote the program.
859452	859852	Yay.
861033	861733	I'm excited.
862093	867914	I'm ordering my next week, because I have to buy a ticket to see Alan Jackson.
869372	872194	Why are you buying a ticket willingly to go to a country concert?
872255	873696	Because my mom wants to go.
873716	875597	It's her birthday.
875998	879841	That's like when I was going to buy my mom a ticket to see Celine Dion in Vegas.
880602	882684	But then I realized I don't want to contribute to that.
884785	885926	Your mom likes Celine Dion.
885966	887428	Yeah, my mom loves Celine Dion.
888388	890150	You know who else my mom likes a lot?
890170	891731	Barbara Streisand.
891811	894073	I'm sorry, but is she tone deaf?
894314	897056	My mom also bought the Rosie O'Donnell Christmas album.
900138	904821	But Celine Dion can't sing for shit.
905601	907883	The only good song she did was like by Meatloaf.
909484	910405	Yeah, Meatloaf's cool.
911065	911946	Yeah, he was Eddie.
913207	916809	I see Maren is in our chat room and she's going to Alabama with you.
917230	919151	And she says, I don't have to go to Alan Jackson.
919231	919652	Ha ha.
919992	920992	I'll make you go.
921013	922133	I'll buy your damn ticket.
922994	923654	Just watch.
923674	925776	You're coming to see Alan Jackson and Biloxi with us.
927623	950147	I'm probably going to leave her over at Mama Sun Ha ha, you opened your mouth Anyway I love that smiley Usually at the top of the show we talk about how was your day, how was your week But today I wanted to be a little different Let's talk about Orange Lounge Radio Goes to the Movies
950566	951346	Yay!
951366	951446	Yay!
951466	951626	Yay!
951666	951806	Yay!
952207	952347	Yay!
978726	984567	is different blood effects of various types, whether it be CG or liquid.
986108	987488	Blood in various colors.
988769	989329	Oh, no CG.
989669	1001332	Well, there's still various different types of blood effects, like everything from the squirt to the splatter to the animated to the blood.
1001692	1002912	You know, it was blood.
1003812	1005233	Lots, lots, lots, lots of it.
1005293	1006373	Most of the movie was in Japanese.
1007668	1013069	And there were puns in the movie, and if you don't really understand Japanese, then you won't get them.
1013129	1016530	So I was there laughing in the theater, and people were giving me weird looks.
1017250	1017890	That was great.
1019911	1021831	And then, like, the people in the theater were funny, too.
1023211	1032453	Like, I'm not going to say what the scene was, but there was this one particular really awesome scene, and it gets really quiet, and this guy's back's like, whoa, and everybody busts it up.
1037660	1039521	And the whole movie was just fantastic.
1041042	1042162	On a scale of 1 to 10?
1044043	1044504	5,000 million.
1045204	1046985	Which is just one point short of Battle Royale.
1048906	1049246	All right.
1050407	1053148	Loki, what did you think of Kill Bill, Volume 1?
1053628	1054669	I already knew it was going to be good.
1054689	1056450	I already read the script beforehand.
1056470	1057270	You little pirate.
1058851	1059892	I didn't pirate the script.
1059952	1060572	It was online.
1060592	1061232	You know, whatever.
1062873	1065575	How can I be a pirate if it was readily available online?
1065775	1065915	But...
1066431	1068752	Was it readily available from Miramax?
1068792	1073574	Did Miramax distribute the script, or did some little kid find it and put it out for everybody to download?
1073874	1074195	I don't know.
1074235	1076115	Just because it's on the internet doesn't mean it's legal.
1077196	1077776	I don't know.
1078957	1081038	It was at Moviesource.com.
1082618	1086500	But, anyways, it was pretty, it was good.
1086640	1087080	I liked it.
1087180	1089381	It was everything I thought it was going to be, so, yeah.
1090782	1091002	Yeah.
1092103	1093083	On a scale of one to ten?
1093103	1093163	Ten.
1094142	1094723	Oh, good.
1094763	1094843	It's 10.
1095103	1096404	It's Oscar material.
1098266	1098706	I'm sorry.
1098726	1099967	I don't see that ever happening.
1100848	1101268	Oh, come on.
1101348	1102269	Pulp Fiction.
1103450	1103790	Okay.
1103810	1105292	Look at that.
1105312	1105952	See?
1106272	1107934	This is a little different than Pulp Fiction.
1107974	1109635	Pulp Fiction was different.
1110436	1111757	Well, it doesn't matter because you know what?
1112297	1113578	Pulp Fiction had way more dialogue than this movie.
1113599	1116141	They're not distributing screens for the small titles, so they're not going to win.
1116161	1117522	So, ha, it's going to win.
1118142	1121225	Pulp Fiction had way more dialogue than this movie did.
1122046	1124627	Pulp Fiction used the F word about... I counted one time.
1124667	1127887	I think Pulp Fiction has the F word in it 256 times.
1128687	1130268	And this movie had it maybe... 40?
1133888	1135329	Just because there's that... But there was blood.
1135429	1136909	Yes, I know there was blood.
1136929	1139069	Imagine each blood spurt as another fuck.
1139670	1140470	There you go.
1145651	1147671	That was a pair of the suckiest throws ever.
1149351	1150992	By the way... You throw like a girl.
1151312	1151452	There...
1152418	1155579	There are two tie-ins, by the way, to Battle Royale, not just one.
1156219	1159580	Other than, what was her name, Kuriyama Chiaki?
1160361	1162301	The chick who plays Chinguisa.
1162421	1165262	You're saying Lingui-sa, which is Italian.
1165422	1166203	Chinguisa.
1166583	1167463	That's it, sorry.
1167963	1169344	Yes, that's her, but there's another one.
1170184	1178567	In the animated sequence, the girl's voice actor is Maeda Ai, who played the girl at the very beginning of Battle Royale with the blood all over her face.
1178847	1179367	Oh, cool.
1179907	1181948	And who is in Battle Royale, too.
1182915	1183375	Very cool.
1183495	1183816	Yay.
1184636	1188559	And for other anime fans, Midori Kawa's in it.
1188639	1190440	You can tell him by his nasally-ass voice.
1190480	1191481	So, here we go.
1192622	1194583	And there is an anime sequence.
1194603	1196024	It's probably about ten minutes long.
1196164	1198986	Yeah, it was done by... It was done by the folks at Ghost in the Shell, right?
1199426	1201648	Yeah, it was done by... What studio was it?
1202048	1202949	Studio Gonzo.
1204009	1205490	That studio did that.
1208116	1216959	Um, my review of Kill Bill was, it was, okay, this is, this is the interesting thing because every geek I know just totally fucking loved this movie.
1217359	1222660	Like, I've been reading LiveJournal over the weekend and stuff and all my geek friends who saw it was like, this is the coolest movie ever.
1223201	1227702	Because it's an homage, it's a, it pays homage to everything geek.
1228362	1230223	It is just like a tribute to everything geek.
1230583	1237425	Like, it is, and, and this is the thing is that Tarantino is a fan of like everything that we talk about on this show.
1237816	1249461	Like, when I was watching the movie, I knew Jamie was just going to be wet watching this movie because I could see all these influences from, like, all of her favorite things that she never shuts up about, like Battle Royale and the anime and all that stuff.
1249481	1252142	So I was just like, oh, Jamie's going to be loving this when she sees it.
1252422	1254563	And I really loved it, too, because I like all that stuff, too.
1255003	1255963	And the blood was great.
1256263	1259825	And, um... What?
1263526	1263867	What?
1264607	1265547	And the spanking.
1265567	1267288	Yeah, I was just thinking that, too.
1267819	1269120	That was one of the best.
1269460	1272061	I don't want to spoil it, but that was the best thing in the whole movie.
1273501	1274362	And the pussy wagon.
1274702	1275402	The pussy wagon.
1275702	1276063	Okay.
1276343	1276703	That's it.
1276743	1277083	That's it.
1277243	1277963	I won't say anything else.
1278524	1279784	On a scale of 1 to 10, what?
1282485	1285687	On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 10.1.
1287487	1287847	I win.
1287867	1289508	50 million.
1289668	1291349	Does Bradley have anything you want to say about Kill Bill?
1293470	1294410	Yes, it was cool.
1295551	1296031	I enjoyed it.
1297403	1301905	I don't know, I can't really add anything because people say it the most.
1301985	1303966	I was kind of sitting there.
1304566	1305827	So I give it a 10 because it was really cool.
1305987	1306367	You can give it a 10.
1306427	1307368	All right.
1307608	1308769	I'd have to see it again sometime.
1308929	1312030	Andrew, I know you haven't seen it, but what would you give it on a scale of 1 to 10?
1314671	1318093	Based on what Jamie goes, 25 million.
1318573	1320674	And if everyone in this room gives me a dollar, I can go see it.
1321495	1322215	How about no?
1322695	1323376	But you know what?
1323896	1326157	We'll give you those sucky cookies to sell on eBay.
1332027	1339890	God damn, am I the only person who knows how to throw a microphone?
1339910	1341731	Wait, were you guys going to go see it again tonight after the show?
1341971	1342171	No.
1342731	1343472	Oh.
1343992	1344572	I'd be down.
1344732	1345853	Dork boy has a way home.
1346313	1346793	But we'll go.
1347093	1347493	I'll go.
1347813	1348294	We should go.
1348434	1348934	Let's go.
1349394	1349714	Sorry.
1350834	1352275	Call your dad and tell him you're staying out late tonight.
1352295	1353215	We're going to see Kill Bill again.
1354356	1354876	After the show.
1355596	1357477	We'll go catch a 10 o'clock showing in Fulton or something.
1362020	1362901	Well, we'll figure something out.
1363921	1364361	Maybe later.
1364381	1366422	Do you want to go after the show?
1366522	1366722	Okay.
1366942	1367983	I have to see it three more times.
1368383	1369183	Okay, we'll go see it.
1369203	1371444	You know, I only saw Freddy vs. Jason twice.
1372164	1372504	Really?
1372824	1375085	So I definitely have to see Kill Bill four times.
1376926	1380547	Explain Jamie's rating system by how many times she watches a movie.
1380607	1384249	If I really like a movie, then, see, four is my favorite number.
1385229	1389711	This is where my small bit of obsessive compulsive disorder sneaks in.
1390327	1391348	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1416365	1417346	You know what I'm thinking?
1417806	1426711	The most number of times, not counting Rocky Horror Picture Show, that's an exception obviously, but not counting Rocky Horror Picture Show, the most number of times I've seen a movie in the theater is three.
1427552	1429973	And I saw Titanic three times in the theater.
1431074	1431474	Dork.
1431914	1432775	Just don't ask.
1432795	1433915	I got dragged by different people.
1434476	1436797	And I saw Shakespeare in Love three times in the theater.
1437987	1439848	So I think I need to see Kill Bill four times.
1440228	1445410	This started back with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie.
1446771	1448531	Which I've seen in the theater four times.
1448551	1451492	Did you see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2, The Secret of the Ooze, four times?
1451512	1452053	I saw it twice.
1453353	1454974	I saw the third one twice as well.
1456535	1457895	The third one was cool.
1458135	1459176	The third one was just neat.
1459196	1460496	The third one was cool.
1461216	1461637	Shut up.
1461677	1467459	I've seen Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey four times in the theater.
1468755	1494294	I've seen Harry Potter and Chamber of Secrets four times in the theater because I didn't actually see I wasn't into Harry Potter when the first movie came out I've seen Freddy vs. Jason twice I've seen now there was one movie I saw six times in the theater and I forgot what it was just because I kept having to go with people and I didn't like the movie but that doesn't fall into my rating system Titanic I've seen The Matrix twice in the theater
1496383	1499665	Well, anyway, I thought we could all give our little review on it.
1501046	1501826	Andrew, just go with us.
1502707	1503567	We'll cover you somehow.
1503587	1504047	I'll help you.
1504308	1505869	We'll take pity on your poor, pathetic soul.
1505889	1506469	Yeah, we'll take pity on you.
1507990	1509651	Because you're going to be offering it up to Tarantino anyway.
1509671	1511852	You can get into an R-rated movie all by yourself now, huh?
1512352	1512853	Yay!
1514173	1516595	How does it feel to be a big boy?
1518276	1521918	Can we, can you, wait, Andrew, will you stand up and pose on our webcam real fast?
1521938	1522838	Will you stand in front of the cam?
1522858	1523939	Because I want to read your shirts.
1524244	1526365	because your shirt, I swear it's like reading a novel right here.
1526626	1529027	Stan, you don't read many books, do you?
1529247	1529587	Shut up.
1530548	1533250	I'm going to read this for you guys who can't see it on the cam because it's kind of blurry.
1533270	1535651	It says, Mom, Dad, I'm so sorry.
1535911	1541095	I know you told me not to have anybody in the house while you were away, but when my friends stopped by, I had to let them in.
1541415	1542556	It wasn't planned or anything.
1542836	1544437	I certainly wouldn't call it a party.
1544837	1548940	Honestly, I have no idea how the band got here or why the police were called.
1549240	1552622	I'm really, really sorry about the house, but that's why we have insurance, right?
1553191	1555332	How many times do you get stopped so people can read that shirt?
1557033	1558754	More times than people stop to talk to me.
1562697	1564097	Is that your way of getting attention?
1566379	1568580	We need to get him the shirt that you got me.
1568600	1571301	I hate my life.
1571382	1572242	I hate my life.
1572342	1575884	Every day I polish my revolver and I shoot my head like a rock star.
1577785	1582388	This 80 year old lady stopped me in the grocery store to read my shirt and said it was the funniest thing she's ever seen in her life.
1590532	1602339	and then while the rest of us are at Scandia lamenting it evil place why should we go to ARC for DDR?
1602379	1612366	you're like one of the only people that sticks up for this little community college with a DDR machine and I have no interest in going to college to play DDR but I'm curious to hear why you love it so much
1612771	1616212	It's cheap, it's loud, they've got all the unlocks, it's in perfect condition.
1616392	1617693	They keep it in perfect condition.
1618433	1621494	If it isn't in perfect condition, I damn well beat their asses for it.
1621514	1624335	It's like, okay, somebody fix the pad, now.
1625195	1626096	You know what they need to do?
1626356	1631737	They need to put DDR machines next to military drafting boards.
1632778	1635199	That would be the ultimate military idea.
1636459	1636839	Why?
1637099	1641801	Get stupid, nerdy people in there, trick them into going there, and then they're in the military.
1643471	1646672	You're going to basic trick maniac them into the military.
1646692	1650952	That was really dumb.
1651733	1652133	Really dumb.
1652173	1654093	I just brought this show to a screeching halt.
1654133	1654633	Amazing.
1655013	1659774	You know, I'm sure you would probably say that you pulled a magus, but I can't do that.
1660294	1661614	It would sound better in Portuguese.
1663034	1667095	Especially since someone took your joke book so that they could wipe their ass.
1669056	1671236	If anyone's been keeping up with my board, hello.
1672762	1674183	Would you like to give your board a plug?
1674683	1675123	Yes.
1675483	1676904	It needs to be plugged into the wall.
1676964	1677965	It has some life in it.
1679245	1680706	I posted on your board this week.
1680986	1683127	Yeah, and the puzzle pirate said that nobody reads.
1683588	1685709	Hey, I read it.
1685909	1687950	It's roleplay.darksakura.com.
1687990	1690952	There is no www in front of it, so don't be stupid and put it in front of there.
1691512	1693813	Just roleplay.darksakura.com.
1694193	1695014	It's that easy.
1695094	1695794	Sign up for it.
1696154	1697295	Become one with the nerdiness.
1699406	1703807	All right, let's move into how was your week, how was your day, because I want to hear how your guys' week and your day was.
1703867	1705488	So, Jamie, how was your week, how was your day?
1705728	1706828	Week sucked.
1708989	1718792	I had like a really bad night within the week, which was alleviated by some strategically IM'd cat pictures.
1721213	1725874	And I was just really kind of crappy all week.
1726174	1727695	And I had a really good day Friday.
1728137	1731738	And then I was really disappointed because Dan was like, I don't want to go to the movie.
1732038	1733339	So I was like, well, fine.
1734139	1741582	So, um, basically what happened Friday is, okay, last week was customer service week all week, which was kind of neat.
1742162	1746524	And, you know, Thursday was what is your favorite decade day, so I dressed all 80s, it was great.
1747644	1750866	And, uh, played, you know, Duran Duran in my cubicle all day.
1752086	1756968	And then, uh, Thursday, not Thursday, but Friday, I, uh,
1758263	1759644	They fed us spaghetti.
1760825	1763867	My supervisor cooked it, and she makes really good spaghetti.
1764407	1768150	And then I get home, and I'm like, Okay, Dan, we're going to go see Kill Bill, right?
1768170	1769931	And he's like, Uh, I cooked you dinner.
1770752	1771773	Oh, how nice.
1772813	1773554	He cooked spaghetti.
1774735	1775896	He's had spaghetti twice.
1776796	1777737	And so I went to the...
1780981	1785544	I went to the store and bought some garlic bread and some real parmesan cheese.
1786984	1789306	You don't like the powder parmesan cheese?
1789346	1790967	You have to have the actual cheese?
1791007	1794149	Since I've had real parmesan cheese, I have to have real parmesan cheese every time.
1795229	1797891	I'm such a snob when it comes to what I put on my food.
1799191	1800612	You cheese elitist.
1800632	1801933	Don't bite my ass.
1802493	1803354	I'll show you cheese.
1805015	1805375	Anyway.
1805395	1808577	I don't.
1809769	1813870	I would not have eaten that cookie if I had known what it was to begin with.
1814531	1815951	That cookie deceived me.
1817391	1819712	That cookie is fucking evil.
1819732	1823553	Can you provide our listeners with a little bit of backstory on the cookies that suck?
1824714	1825154	Okay.
1827154	1828535	I love oat milk cream cookies.
1829215	1830295	Very, very, very much.
1831236	1837037	And I usually go to the dollar store and buy the generic ones that have real cream in them, not this marshmallow crap.
1837057	1839098	Because I hate marshmallows
1840140	1840700	So much.
1841321	1842521	Because the texture just sucks.
1842541	1844442	The only way I will eat a marshmallow is if it's on fire.
1844462	1845863	Flames on the side of my face.
1846604	1847084	Heaving.
1847504	1848265	Breath heaving.
1848305	1848645	Shut up.
1850266	1850606	Shut up.
1850926	1851586	Don't tease me.
1852707	1853668	By the way, you're turning purple.
1854468	1854788	Anyway.
1855929	1856189	Don't see.
1856229	1857470	You're getting retarded.
1857490	1858430	I love you.
1858910	1860171	You love me.
1860191	1863893	I think you said purple, not retarded.
1863973	1864013	Um.
1869560	1870661	There's nothing to throw.
1870721	1871561	Finish your story.
1873783	1875504	No, do not throw the cookie you suck.
1876404	1876664	No!
1877885	1878886	Oh, that hit my tummy.
1881227	1882028	Yeah, where's the ferrets?
1883148	1883509	Rob?
1884389	1885129	I do not know.
1885730	1886770	Okay, whatever.
1888532	1893595	Anyway... Anyway, um... We get to the checkout counter at Walmart.
1895976	1897057	You totally missed.
1897757	1898037	Anyway...
1900131	1901492	We got to the checkout counter at Walmart.
1902432	1908534	And I am delighted and thrilled to see oatmeal cream cookies on the Little Debbie snack bar.
1909274	1910814	So I... What is that?
1912315	1913435	It's a baked potato.
1914695	1915295	No, I'm sorry.
1915396	1916576	It's Bake-O-Bits.
1916696	1918836	Smells like artificial pork.
1919637	1919997	Anyway.
1922838	1923258	Anyway.
1924278	1927599	I grab the box and I hug the box as excited as I am.
1928419	1930319	and I freaking... She did, I was there.
1931220	1934300	I fucked... I fucked... You fucked the box.
1934380	1935620	I fucked the box.
1936581	1941822	I forked over the money for this... You're eating bacon bits out of the box?
1941902	1942442	My God.
1943982	1944622	Tell your story.
1944742	1949743	Anyway, I forked over the money to get this thing of oatmeal cream pie things.
1949863	1950463	Get in the car.
1950883	1952464	I'm halfway through the cookie, mind you.
1953444	1954584	These things are too chewy.
1956584	1957624	These things suck.
1957784	1958705	I can't taste the cream.
1959685	1961666	Oh my God, it's marshmallow.
1962566	1962746	Ew.
1962786	1965187	And then we look at the box and it reduces fat and I'm like, oh well shit.
1966827	1970248	So, I gave one to, I had Rob eat one.
1970969	1973309	And Rob agrees with me that they're the worst cookies ever.
1973729	1973990	Right?
1975210	1975530	Sucks.
1976490	1978991	So we decided that we were going to come back and make everybody else eat them.
1980392	1981592	And we've been successful so far.
1984984	1989865	This reminds me, there's one part in Kill Bill where there's a cereal box called Kaboom.
1992686	1995686	I remembered it from when I was like five to ten years old.
1995706	1996467	I know.
1997167	1998847	I hated that cereal.
1999027	2002608	We grabbed it one day and it was the worst cereal that I ever had tasted.
2003628	2006029	So we took one bite and we basically threw out the box.
2007829	2011010	That was the throwback moment from that.
2011550	2012570	They need to make shirts.
2013277	2015979	with old cereal boxes on them, like Mr. T Cereal?
2017159	2019621	I want a shirt with Mr. T Cereal on the front.
2020341	2022942	Or the Nintendo Breakfast System.
2026104	2027925	Like, it's for breakfast now.
2031507	2033388	Why is it... I feel really old.
2036450	2042013	Yeah, you were still... It was earlier than that.
2045289	2045609	Okay.
2048650	2051412	Anyway, nobody can hear what you're saying anyway, so shut up.
2053953	2061576	Anyway, you know what, I've noticed that so many things from when I was younger are making a big comeback now.
2062816	2067378	You know, like, you know, they're doing all the re-releases of Transformers.
2068038	2071720	I have my Season 3 box set now, and it's only the first half of it.
2073217	2079822	I watched the worst episode of Transformers in history next to Carnage in C minor or major, whatever it was.
2079842	2080363	You know what?
2080543	2084065	It's the Starscream's Ghost episode for season three and it's the worst episode ever.
2084506	2086808	You said everything from your youth is making a comeback, right?
2086828	2090670	That's because they say like things cycle in 20 year cycles.
2090771	2093353	Like in the 80s, 60s things were popular again.
2093393	2098797	And here we are in the year 2000s and the 80s stuff is making a comeback because it's 20 years ago.
2098837	2100298	So like all the stuff from our childhood is making a comeback.
2100558	2102960	Just think, in 20 years, DDR is going to make a comeback.
2108061	2111163	Remember that retro geeky dancing game we all used to play?
2112303	2113244	Technically, didn't we?
2115345	2116266	Dance Aerobics!
2118547	2120528	Man, that Dance Aerobics game was the shit.
2120948	2121529	Sorry to interrupt.
2121549	2124370	Well, now we're getting what, um, Aerobics Revolution?
2126231	2126992	Is that in Japan now?
2127592	2128312	Uh, I think so, yeah.
2130614	2131414	I have spirits.
2134516	2135356	You know, it got quiet.
2135656	2136717	Well, are you done with your story?
2137864	2138745	I was telling a story.
2139666	2140006	Oops.
2141327	2142468	I got sidetracked, sorry.
2144570	2145050	It's alright.
2146391	2147292	That happens all the time.
2147332	2148073	So whose turn is it?
2148693	2149234	Uh, Loki's.
2149574	2150595	Here you go, Bacon Breath.
2152857	2153577	Loki, how was your week?
2153597	2154058	How was your day?
2154258	2155419	Almost Bacon Breath.
2157180	2157861	Bacon Breath.
2158221	2159122	Yeah, Bacon Breath.
2159702	2161243	Um, my week was good.
2161503	2163405	I finished both DDR pads.
2163445	2164506	They're done, thank God.
2165126	2167008	I'm so glad to be done with those.
2168920	2171301	and so I finished those.
2171341	2175422	I had to kind of actually, they were finished last night, very late.
2175842	2186546	I had to do a really ghetto job on one of the panels because I lost one of the corner pieces somehow and so there's a nice little square metal piece holding one of the panels and I see it.
2187707	2189447	It's a square mending bracket.
2190007	2196850	But anyways, I started this morning or afternoon, I started my cabinet so...
2198070	2209714	by estimates it shouldn't take too long to do, probably about a week or two and it'll be done because I'm already, you know, almost finished drawing up the first, um, the first, what the hell?
2213015	2213275	Yeah.
2216596	2216796	Okay.
2217216	2224598	Anyways, um, yeah, I'm almost done drawing up the first, um, whole sheet of, um,
2225595	2227456	Hey, don't be knocking it, you know you'll enjoy it.
2227496	2232900	Fucking being able to break out the old school games and stuff.
2250495	2260797	Anyway, then yesterday we went down to Golf Land and played a bunch of F-Zero because there's no one playing it and there was a bunch of other people playing DDR and some retard unplugged the machine while we were trying to play it.
2261037	2261718	Fuckers.
2264698	2265078	What else?
2265298	2266639	Oh, not too much.
2267659	2269219	I hear Drum Mania is broken again.
2269780	2270320	Actually, it was.
2270720	2275061	It was in police call attendant mode, so as soon as Keith gets back there on Monday, I'll be fine again.
2275741	2275821	Okay.
2277509	2278069	Then what else?
2278269	2282652	Oh, during the week sucked and didn't do a whole lot other than see Kill Bill.
2282892	2283413	That was cool.
2284593	2285214	Yeah, that's it.
2285594	2286054	Not too much.
2290237	2294519	Okay, let's talk to, um, let's talk to Andrew.
2295800	2296440	Andrew, how was your week?
2296460	2296821	How was your day?
2299402	2300703	Week, exhausting.
2301023	2302164	Day, to suck.
2303665	2303805	Uh...
2304727	2309510	Just day after day after day of college, which is absolutely tiring.
2311491	2315453	And we'll get to that a little bit in the FUs.
2316194	2318735	Today I just sat around, played Ragnarok.
2319175	2325579	Actually leveled a couple of times, which is getting harder and harder, but figured it all balances out.
2325599	2327000	That's about it.
2327020	2329001	At least got bored and decided to come here.
2337421	2342644	You know, I've actually considered getting back into Ragnarok lately, but I decided to start Final Fantasy X again.
2344124	2344925	No, Ragnarok.
2346366	2348727	Not until I finish Final Fantasy X. I'll tank your Acolyte.
2349247	2350007	Play Ragnarok.
2350528	2355330	Wait, are you on Loki server?
2355370	2356551	I play on all three servers.
2356571	2367036	You have to play on Chaos so I can take you out with my assassin and gain you like, what, 20 levels in an hour?
2368334	2368834	I can do that.
2372375	2378556	No, not until I finish Final Fantasy X. Because I started Final Fantasy X some time ago, like about a year and a half.
2378576	2379457	No, it was about a year ago.
2380037	2381377	Because it was when I was with my ex.
2381517	2382257	It was a year ago.
2382737	2384498	And I started it and I never finished it.
2384918	2386138	I only got about ten hours into it.
2386238	2388619	And so last week after the show, I picked it up again.
2388659	2389819	I said, I'm bored.
2389859	2390619	I need something to do.
2390639	2393800	So I'm like, okay, I'm going to play Final Fantasy X. I'm going to play it.
2393840	2394380	I'm going to beat it.
2394827	2396248	I need to restart the international one.
2396488	2399870	And in this one week, I'm already past where I was last time.
2400830	2402271	I just got past that point today.
2403912	2405172	You want to know what's going to be scary?
2405292	2406673	The international version is easier.
2407894	2411095	So if I get started playing, I'll catch up to you.
2413616	2415377	Yes, I know Final Fantasy X is so 2002.
2415417	2415697	So what?
2417276	2418097	I'm a late bloomer.
2418117	2418517	Rob's retro.
2418777	2419498	I'm retro.
2420278	2420919	And you know what?
2421419	2428864	With Final Fantasy X-2 coming out pretty soon, you know, it means the story will be fresh in my mind.
2428884	2436109	If anyone has ever been to the GameStop in Arden Fair Mall, that was my DVD in the machine there.
2436129	2440312	Remember that crappy DVD that I picked up last time you were here, when Maren was here?
2441474	2445515	That's the DVD that's been selling all the pre-orders at Arden Fair Mall.
2445695	2446315	Yeah, that's cool.
2446435	2447055	Whatever works.
2447455	2451816	Yeah, so my DVD, my piece of shit DVD went to a good use.
2452556	2452936	Good deal.
2454276	2455356	Let's hear from Bradley.
2455396	2455877	How was your day?
2455917	2456417	How was your week?
2458477	2462938	Well, most of my week was spent looking for jobs type things.
2463598	2467719	Like working on my cover letter and trying a few things.
2468219	2469999	Waiting for the... What was the...
2472716	2480500	What the final word on that job I interviewed last week for and finally they got back to me and said I didn't get it on Thursday.
2482541	2499468	Well, on that same day I got a one day job for Friday where I just went in and on Friday I went up and typed in a bunch of names and addresses and phone and fax numbers for a mailing list type thing for a sort of testing software, basically like
2500262	2504906	One of those Excel access, all those type testing programs.
2507248	2509569	That could have been their list.
2509589	2510750	They might have just told me wrong.
2512191	2517836	And I listened to a woman in there talking about the Governator over and over again to various people on the phone.
2520678	2521879	I hear grumbling in the background.
2522459	2523400	It's over.
2523420	2525442	Let's not talk about it anymore.
2525462	2528304	This isn't even real Bako's.
2529076	2529817	No, they're Fakos.
2529837	2535821	They're bacon-flavored chips brand bacon things with no MSG.
2536321	2538062	Yeah, they are.
2538443	2538763	Sorry.
2538923	2539583	It's okay.
2539664	2541024	I might have commented on them.
2541665	2542085	Let's see.
2542145	2544047	It's my job to make the random side comments.
2546789	2551992	Spent time putting stuff on eBay because I need to get money fast before I run out.
2553754	2554174	And let's see.
2554234	2557796	On Saturday, I got invited out to go see Kill Bill via...
2561054	2562835	One person people know, Neil.
2564036	2565997	He invited me out and said that he'd pay for it.
2566697	2570379	But then I drove all the way out to Fairfield so that cost about the same amount as a ticket.
2571360	2573421	But I actually had gas.
2573441	2577183	I didn't have the kind of money to actually pay for that.
2577203	2578263	It was in my wallet at the time.
2579004	2585467	So we sold that and ate at the only Chick-fil-A in Northern California.
2585967	2586968	Chick-fil-A is awesome.
2589539	2590560	And they're closed on Sundays.
2591360	2593422	Yeah, I haven't eaten there for like a year and a half.
2594322	2598365	Chick-fil-A is the best chicken fast food chain ever.
2599146	2605450	You can only get Chick-fil-A, no, I take that back, because there's a Chick-fil-A restaurant in Mobile, but usually the only places I've ever seen them are in malls.
2606411	2611094	And apparently the owner of the company is, you know, super Christian, and they're always closed on Sunday.
2612035	2612835	But they have the best chicken.
2613616	2614917	Yes, their chicken is very good.
2614997	2615957	And Polynesian sauce.
2616278	2616418	Mm-hmm.
2623324	2625365	No one can hear what you're saying.
2625946	2627127	That's a good thing.
2627827	2628528	Continue, please.
2628948	2637875	All right, and today, just put more stuff up on eBay.
2639216	2644060	I don't need to figure out any other plan of action for looking for jobs really fast.
2645621	2648543	Food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food.
2649096	2649997	basically, that's all.
2652438	2653319	Now everyone's asleep.
2654039	2654679	Wake up, wake up!
2657001	2662724	Alright, I'll take over then because I haven't talked about my week and my day and I know everybody wants to hear about my week and my day.
2663845	2666387	I actually did pay some money this week on Friday.
2666447	2676333	I had some tokens left so I went by Roseville Golf Land and played two games of two games of Tar Freaks and one game of DDR but then I failed on
2677234	2681478	Twilight Zone, because I forgot to turn off the shuffle.
2681878	2683119	It just failed right at the end.
2685241	2686102	Okay, now you go.
2687764	2688985	Okay, my week and my day.
2690126	2693589	For my week, I didn't do a whole lot of exciting stuff.
2693629	2696912	I played a lot of Final Fantasy X, and I did a lot of napping.
2697732	2700895	And Vanilla Sky on Monday was great, of course.
2701796	2703758	And let's see...
2704887	2712072	I went out to Golfland on Thursday and I played some DDR and some S0 and I also did last night, Saturday night.
2713393	2719797	And I don't really like going to Golfland on the weekends because I run into too many people that are in line and stuff.
2720017	2724741	Not that I... I mean, I like seeing some of the people in the DDR community that I don't get to see very often.
2724761	2727563	I mean, that was cool because I saw one guy I don't get to see very often.
2727583	2731325	I'm going to tell it during the FUs.
2731705	2731986	And then...
2733052	2736575	I see some good faces and that's cool.
2736595	2740717	But then there's just a lot of those people to get in the way.
2743159	2744960	So I don't like that on Saturday.
2744980	2754146	And all the guy and their girlfriend that are trying to play DDR for the first time because it's cute and stuff like that.
2754547	2758529	And I guess I should stop being so elitist because that's how we all get into DDR at one point.
2758609	2761391	But I just don't like waiting is what it boils down to.
2761531	2762172	So, you know.
2762679	2763880	Get out of my way, I want to play.
2765421	2769103	So that's why Thursdays are always better for DDR.
2769203	2775187	Friday night was supposed to be this great night where we were going to go see the movie and we were going to go out dancing and we were going to get our slut on.
2775628	2776528	But it didn't happen.
2776568	2778730	We just went to the movie and then went to eat and then we went home.
2779910	2781692	We ended up going out because we were all lazy.
2782052	2785174	And my friend at work is going to kill me because we were supposed to meet her out Saturday night.
2787175	2788816	Yes, Billy was supposed to come back last night.
2788856	2791378	My sister Billy was supposed to be here.
2792728	2796489	Yeah, my sister, Billy, was supposed to be here yesterday, but he didn't come back.
2796889	2802892	And I think a sheep ate him, because he lives in Chico, and all they have up there is sheep.
2805132	2813155	And that was pretty much my day of my week, because I did napping, Final Fantasy X, some DDR, some F-Zero, and Kill Bill.
2813675	2814456	That was pretty much it.
2817037	2820818	And Jamie's destroying the kitchen, so I think now's a good time for us to take a break.
2821974	2825976	We're going to take a break, and we're going to come back, and I don't know, what do you guys want to do when we come back?
2825996	2828877	You want to do a cage match, FU's of the week, you want to talk about more stuff?
2828937	2829197	What?
2829977	2830257	Alright.
2830877	2843482	We're going to do the FU's of the week when we come back, so if you want to send your FU's of the week to me, Sky, in the chat room, and to get into our chat room, go to www.callyvamani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat.
2844903	2848904	In the meantime, we're going to play in this break, I think we're going to do something a little bit longer in this break.
2849705	2850485	We're going to do
2851621	2853202	Yes, it's longer and harder.
2854002	2859545	No, we're going to do the 80s Do It Right, the electro-extended mix.
2859705	2860986	We're going to do the long version of that.
2861006	2863247	It's about five minutes long, but it's a good break song.
2863287	2865468	So after this, we'll be back with the FUs of the Week.
2870314	2871255	Thanks for watching!
2897583	2897964	DarkSakura
2969341	2970586	What you wanna do?
2970606	2971610	Get into the groove
3034265	3035093	Thank you for watching!
3057369	3057789	Thank you.
3098101	3098702	Thank you for watching.
3136736	3136937	Thank you.
3193941	3198125	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
3199266	3199906	No!
3202909	3204270	Do we care what people think of us?
3204891	3206652	No!
3206752	3208234	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
3208714	3209995	Yes!
3210456	3210616	Yes!
3212802	3214684	Extreme Bobani Radio.
3214864	3218648	That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
3221711	3222391	Hi, we're back.
3223573	3231480	I'm eating, sorry, and I'm drinking shitty beer that Jamie's making me drink because she's a bad after-school special bully.
3232261	3233923	See?
3233983	3234203	See?
3239176	3242378	No, Triscuits Reduce Fat and Wheat Thins Reduce Fat, that's okay.
3242478	3245779	It's those goddamn cookies where they like just totally don't even taste right.
3254643	3256704	It's like eating reduced fat ice cream.
3256744	3257405	What's the point?
3260526	3262627	But it's ice, you know, ice cream's good.
3262667	3264288	If you're going to eat ice cream, you know what?
3274298	3279259	The only beer that Orange Lounge Radio endorses would be Guinness, by the way, if you're curious.
3279559	3281680	I would say the only beer that we endorse is Guinness.
3284360	3286180	And why do we like Guinness so much, Jamie?
3293602	3293902	Yeah.
3297203	3297583	Yeah.
3301964	3303485	Are you ready to do the F.E.s of the week, Jamie?
3305407	3306307	This is fucked up!
3306327	3307048	This is fucked up!
3340297	3341227	This is fucked up!
3384578	3390681	No, it wasn't.
3390941	3392502	Everyone just missed everything I said, didn't they?
3392662	3394664	I was just going to say... I can start all over!
3395084	3395284	Okay.
3395344	3398025	Do you want me to start the music over?
3398145	3398326	No.
3398786	3405790	I said fucking people at Walmart for not taking responsibility for your cart, when you pull out your cart, you need to put it back up.
3406390	3408091	It's really inconsiderate to leave it in people's way.
3409381	3412744	Um, and then I said about parents, fuck all of them, well, most of them.
3414065	3424553	Especially if you decide that, you know, oh, I want to have a kid, and then you don't put any thought into the responsibilities involved with, you know, having the kid.
3425454	3427576	You need to take responsibility for yourself.
3428016	3432059	And then, oh my god, the people who blame everybody else for problems that they cause.
3433421	3438845	You know, you need to, people need to learn how to take responsibility for themselves, for their own actions.
3439827	3443348	You know, you can't believe everything that you see on TV.
3443788	3445248	You can't believe everything that you read.
3445268	3446948	You need to learn how to think for yourself.
3447008	3449269	And so, fuck everybody.
3449369	3450749	Okay, I'm really tired of people.
3451569	3452430	Not everybody.
3452610	3454750	Everybody in this room is in the cool book, except Andrew.
3456250	3460171	You're in the lukewarm book.
3460591	3464532	Fuck Corona, because it sucks, but it's not as bad as that pale ale that I'm making Rob drink.
3466492	3466652	And...
3470732	3473794	Really, I can't think of anything else.
3474634	3477976	What else was I going off about today, Rob?
3478016	3479797	When I was going off in the parking lot at Walmart?
3480957	3484859	I swear my best step is when I'm not on the show.
3485620	3486320	I don't remember.
3486440	3488321	Fuck mages in Ragnarok.
3489141	3490202	I'm a mage.
3490242	3490702	Fight me.
3490742	3491983	Fuck you.
3492223	3494884	For kill stealing.
3495825	3497145	And then fuck glass time.
3497786	3500127	For not bringing me the things to kill fast enough.
3501021	3505003	So that I can level faster because I have an archer and I can snipe off the wall.
3506604	3515229	And then... Fuck me for buying stupid things that nobody wants to buy because I was up to 800,000 zeny.
3515909	3518250	And then I bought a bunch of stuff and then no one's buying it.
3518971	3519871	I made poison belts.
3520091	3523593	I'm selling them for four times what they're worth.
3523853	3524454	But that's about it.
3527142	3530004	Alright, we're gonna go to Loki, who has to explain his new music.
3531625	3532746	It's in theme with the show.
3535528	3535968	I like it.
3536629	3536969	It goes.
3536989	3543994	I have some choking here.
3544755	3545055	Okay.
3546776	3550378	Um, first FU of the week is gonna go to, um, Stupid Drivers.
3552380	3554561	Um, more particularly, um, old people.
3554862	3556463	I don't like you and you drive too slow.
3557250	3561173	And cutting in front of me and then driving slow really pisses me off.
3562414	3567337	And you're lucky that, um, I don't have a gun because I would probably do a drive-by as I'm passing you.
3568057	3570519	But, um, since I don't, I can't do that.
3570719	3573241	All I can do is just get angry and give you glaring looks.
3574882	3585209	Um, um, also, FU2, or, um, fucking neighbors, okay, can't park their truck worth of shit.
3585769	3586530	Okay, yesterday...
3588484	3596827	Yesterday, I tried to pull out of our space, and the guys over the line, like, I practically had, like, to squeeze through to get in there.
3597907	3600228	Meanwhile, they're getting high out in front of their house.
3602689	3607090	Also, lucky as stupid people at Golfland, there's some kids that, like,
3608041	3613424	went and jumped up on the pad and started tapping dumb buttons really hard while I was selecting a song and then left.
3613644	3615565	And I didn't even give a shit at all.
3615625	3619267	I just didn't even look at him, didn't even get angry, pretended it never happened.
3619767	3621188	That pissed him off and that was funny.
3621748	3627752	And then, um, fuck you too, uh... Oh shit, I don't know.
3628032	3631734	Um, the fact that I don't have any food in the fridge because I ate it all.
3632954	3634035	Oh no, I don't want the cracker.
3635609	3639750	So I'm eating, uh, potatoes that are kind of going bad, if potatoes can go bad.
3640711	3645232	But anyways, uh, and then, um, let's see what else.
3647513	3649194	Um, I don't know, I don't really have too much.
3649274	3654235	Fuck you, those stupid DDR pads over at the, uh, theater because they were slippery as hell.
3655876	3658657	I nearly killed myself on those just plain normal songs.
3659037	3659857	Not anything hard.
3659897	3664139	If I played anything hard, probably blood all over the pads, which would have been sweet.
3664539	3664619	Um...
3666628	3675271	and then finally, um, just, uh, FU Yahoo News because you report on this really dumbest shit.
3675831	3684434	Um, also an FU to British scientists because, um, don't you have anything better to do than to, uh, test to see if a cookie crumbles and shit like that?
3685515	3686115	Stupid Brits.
3686755	3687375	They're so dumb.
3688916	3689996	No, it's all about budgeting.
3690036	3695278	See, they start running out of money for funding, so they have to do stupid experiments so that they can keep their budget.
3696661	3699904	Oh, actually, finally, fuck you to the RIAA.
3700244	3700725	Once again.
3701145	3708012	Actually, more, not really the RIAA, but mainly, um, well, anyways, let me, uh, just give a backstory to this.
3708752	3716159	About a week or two ago, there was, um, an announcement of this new copy protection for this CD, or whatever.
3716619	3718781	There's some loser band put out.
3719722	3720643	Probably country.
3721284	3722525	Anyways, and, um...
3723209	3728672	So, it got put out, and then people found out they can get past the copy protection by holding down the shift key.
3729933	3731974	Well, that was pretty dumb of them, now wasn't it?
3732514	3748022	Anyway, so, you know, a few weeks later, this kid, um, in college, writes on his webpage, basically a kind of like a little, uh, essay or, you know, term paper type thing about, you know, copy protection, and he mentioned on that how you can bypass that.
3748422	3751984	Well, the company didn't like that, that they posted that on his site, so...
3753430	3754350	They're suing him.
3755090	3766393	Meanwhile, Yahoo reports this, reports a story saying directly in that article that this CD can be bypassed by holding shift.
3767893	3780316	So, they're suing him for his term paper that got viewed by a couple hundred people, maybe, whereas Yahoo News gets viewed by millions and millions and millions of people.
3781357	3782457	Isn't that a bit ironic?
3784229	3785049	Yeah, that's it.
3785630	3785970	I'm done.
3789392	3790533	I have an FU of the week.
3791193	3799598	I was at Golfland yesterday, and there was this really cool girl there, and I have no idea who she is, but she wore a shirt that said this shirt was tested on animals.
3800233	3800813	Something like that.
3800833	3801613	I thought she was cool.
3801974	3803014	She's really good at DDR.
3803054	3805755	Like, she passed Dropout, which, you know, that's pretty good.
3807656	3816518	So, she was playing, and these asshole drunk people got up next to her and started playing, like, you know, without putting the money in.
3816538	3818839	They were dancing on the pad, like, mocking her and stuff like that.
3818859	3820120	And I fucking hate those people.
3820200	3821340	So, F you to those people.
3821820	3824121	But it was really great because... You didn't have them burn out?
3824821	3825622	I couldn't find them.
3825702	3829803	I was in the middle of my game, and by the time I was done, they were kind of... Well, this is what happened.
3830985	3837008	is that they got up, as soon as I got off Extreme, they went up on Extreme to start playing.
3837409	3846233	And she finished her game right as they put the money in the machine, so she kind of watched them for a minute, and then as soon as they went to select a song, the drunk guy was like, and he's trying to pick a song, right?
3846613	3850576	And she just walked up, hit the down arrow several times, and then walked out the door.
3850956	3852297	It decreased the difficulty.
3852357	3852677	Cool.
3853917	3856119	So, they failed, by the way, if you're listening.
3857059	3858680	I just would have had them done out.
3859486	3863567	I know, I, Keith wasn't there, and I don't like any of the other employees, really.
3864588	3865348	I don't know any of them.
3866328	3870429	You know what, I wonder if my trackers would be perfect to go with that single time.
3870489	3871630	What, getting people thrown out?
3871790	3872790	I get someone thrown out every time.
3872830	3877432	Not if you go Tuesday or Thursday, there's probably ever people there on Tuesday or Thursday, but, like, Saturday, yeah, you could.
3877472	3879352	You could have gotten those people thrown out.
3879372	3880452	That used to be my hobby.
3884454	3888515	Um, that's pretty much it, I don't really have, uh, F you'd anything else.
3889276	3896422	F you to the fact that they decided to split Kill Bill into two parts because I'm impatient and I want to see both parts on Friday.
3898064	3899205	You suck, Miramax.
3900666	3903388	Alright, let's hear from the others assembled here in the room.
3903408	3904229	We'll start with Andrew.
3908573	3909474	I'm not chubbed.
3910495	3911636	Just do your F yous.
3912794	3919199	Alright, F you to my Linux teacher deciding to take a sick day two days before the final.
3919480	3921041	It's our study day, goddammit.
3921201	3922402	Why you gotta take a sick day?
3922782	3924383	Somebody fisk him.
3924704	3925344	Make him all better.
3926245	3937674	Uh... F you to... F you to talking about all this, you know, talking about something and just not being able to get your point across.
3937714	3939676	I find it happens to me way too often.
3940216	3942078	Especially when I'm on the show, so...
3943539	3944120	That's about it.
3944500	3945841	Not too angsty today.
3949862	3950943	Then let's hear from Bradley.
3952023	3962348	Okay, uh, fuck you to not finding work so far.
3962368	3964189	I didn't work hard on that.
3964209	3965510	At least I had that job, I think.
3965570	3967251	Thank you for that, at least.
3967271	3969792	So fuck you to me for doing it too fast.
3970302	3976627	Because I got it done in like 5.5 hours, and they probably would have paid me for the whole day if I had slowed down a bit.
3977448	3978468	Took a while to pass this.
3978508	3979309	Being a lazy ass.
3979389	3981291	Too good at excelling, I guess.
3981391	3983893	It's kind of like thinking of other ways that I could have done it faster.
3983913	3984313	Anyway.
3984393	3984973	Uh, fuck you too...
3996391	4000554	My falling credit rating, because I know it's doing that as we speak.
4000635	4003977	And bad things are coming on the horizon.
4004177	4006019	I don't move really, really fast.
4006219	4007920	I'm getting stuff started paying off.
4008040	4009562	And finding a job, so.
4009602	4018929	And I'm talking to the Bank of America, because they changed their credit card billing system.
4019230	4022292	So it takes a day to pay instead of the same day.
4022512	4023993	So it fucked me up last month.
4025555	4025655	Ugh.
4029050	4036073	Um, I was lucky for taking so- the guy taking so long to finally tell me that I didn't get the job.
4036114	4039055	Made me wait so long to wait for the inevitable.
4039135	4039836	Um, I don't know.
4039896	4042157	It's a huge general situation.
4042177	4043097	But I must persevere.
4056525	4058426	Okay, I think that's about everything.
4060847	4061127	Okay.
4063649	4066010	Alright, then let's hear from our chatroom.
4067050	4068611	Our chatroom's not very angsty tonight.
4068671	4070652	I've only got like three FUs so far.
4072173	4076135	I think they just have been having a good week, so go figure.
4076155	4077976	We'll start with Baka.
4079416	4081457	Says, my FU of the week is to school.
4081537	4084419	Says, tomorrow is Columbus Day and we don't have it off from school.
4084439	4084519	Says,
4084983	4088626	Since I guess, finally, that our school has decided to be politically correct.
4089026	4094490	Since Columbus never was the first person to discover America, but it was the indigenous Native American peoples.
4096771	4098813	Damn school, we should still have a day off.
4098873	4100554	It's supposed to be a national holiday.
4101075	4102275	Fucking bastard holes.
4102576	4103496	Hey, guess what?
4103857	4107499	Numbnuts, I have to work tomorrow, so you can damn well go to school.
4110621	4111302	And you know what?
4111972	4115053	You should have to go to school during summer too, because I don't get summer off.
4120976	4122876	Alright, moving on.
4123717	4132901	Zodiac Knight says, my fuck you of the week goes to BestBuy.com for fucking up my order, postponing my shipment of Max 2 US for another week.
4133881	4134221	Sue.
4134661	4134941	Sue.
4141713	4144035	Mintz would like to say a preemptive F.U.
4144075	4145596	to the week coming up.
4146317	4147458	It's going to be hell for me.
4148999	4149399	F.U.
4149419	4153843	to the Bursar's, I hope I said that right, the Bursar's office at my college.
4153923	4158026	They're charging late fees to me for a balance I paid off three weeks ago.
4159888	4160268	Sue them.
4166773	4168935	Well, Jamie, would you like to repeat that advice?
4172031	4176214	I don't care if he's in the kitchen.
4177575	4179436	The show must go on, goddammit.
4205676	4206456	Um, let's see.
4208137	4212218	Step Mania 3.9 Alpha 7 or something.
4212938	4213778	It's out now.
4214258	4216959	I can't even keep track because the name's getting too long.
4217719	4218239	God damn it.
4218359	4222040	And then, um, some improvements have been made there, I think.
4222600	4227361	And then, uh, I know that they brought back Easy to Dancer support, which, yay.
4227641	4230442	And then, um, what else?
4230682	4233763	People are ripping stuff for, um, Max 2.
4235236	4235756	USA.
4236597	4239618	You know, god damn it, if I did it, I would have been dumb by now.
4239998	4244539	But, you know, they're still doing it, and Lawrence from DDRUK is kind of heading up the project.
4245299	4247720	So that's kind of cool, because he does a really good job on him.
4247740	4248460	What project?
4249100	4250341	Why is it a project?
4251001	4255382	If one guy can do it in an hour, what is needing to be a project of it?
4255402	4256523	Because they're retarded!
4256803	4258223	These people are retarded!
4258563	4263765	They can't fucking just do it, very simple, because it always has to be complicated.
4264363	4271047	They always have to, like, get six people to do it or ten people to do it, and no one knows what they're doing, so that's why it's complicated.
4271247	4271508	Okay.
4271968	4272448	Just wondering.
4272668	4274489	Why has it always got to be so complicated?
4278152	4281854	Um... Why you gotta go make things so complicated?
4281974	4289379	Anyway, other than that, there's going to be also, obviously, now do your extreme stuff to rip, so... And then, uh...
4292588	4295389	Apparently, you don't have to pee too much if they're typing on a keyboard.
4300451	4303773	Pardon me for interrupting your thing, but if you have to pee, just pee.
4304293	4304953	We don't care.
4305113	4305534	Thank you.
4305654	4306334	Pee on the floor.
4306374	4306954	That would be cool.
4309756	4310036	Anyways.
4311976	4318759	Now, also, another thing I found in my little travels on the boards there, they have someone made a...
4320541	4327666	As you know, Stepmania has an unlock system, just in case if you were to ever want to do unlocks.
4329727	4335951	So they actually made an editor so you can do unlocks with an editor, which is kind of neat.
4337172	4337572	What else?
4339913	4340454	P.S.
4340754	4341875	Unlocks are stupid.
4342155	4345497	If you're releasing songs for Stepmania, you know what?
4345517	4346377	You're not DDR.
4346417	4347178	Don't do unlocks.
4347651	4348091	It's gay.
4348231	4348932	Kiss my ass.
4349092	4350993	I'm doing Unlocked for this goddamn hell.
4351013	4351473	You're gay.
4352954	4353854	No, you're gay.
4357336	4357636	Okay.
4359437	4359777	Ah, see?
4359817	4360457	You're right.
4360477	4360838	I'm gay.
4360918	4361198	Sorry.
4361518	4361838	Okay.
4365460	4368341	No, that's RodSteel0014.
4368962	4372363	You only live until you die.
4374224	4374805	That's the title.
4374985	4375565	It's a porno.
4377199	4379801	Did you see that Brad and Irene loaned us the Whore of the Rings 2?
4379901	4381502	I haven't gotten to watch it.
4381642	4383143	That's who it was, Brad and Irene.
4383163	4385604	I was just thinking, Matt doesn't have porno like that.
4387746	4390087	Tall Matt for those listening.
4390408	4391208	Ice Princess.
4391228	4395411	No, there's really not much going on in the sim world.
4395911	4400634	It's been going on like four months now since I played Step Mania, yet for some reason I still download songs.
4400654	4402315	Of course I have it, I guess.
4403056	4403356	Sucker.
4406499	4407219	Bandwith Horror.
4407680	4408560	You say that now.
4414243	4420506	It would have been a good parody of James Bond if they had just removed a lot of the porn stuff.
4420546	4421867	Because it was funny on its own.
4422247	4424148	But then they have people having sex for no reason.
4424308	4427710	And it just detracts from it.
4429630	4433412	I also got six copies of Suicide Circle this week.
4433592	4434493	That was pretty cool.
4438357	4438697	Maybe.
4440078	4442978	Yeah, that's it.
4443118	4444319	Nothing much going on.
4447099	4449060	Okay, well, I think we'll take another break then.
4449620	4452001	You know, we could talk about the actual news going on.
4452661	4453661	We'll talk about it when we come back.
4454161	4454401	Okay.
4454702	4459063	Alright, we're going to play, in this break, we're going to play some more stuff from the V-Rare CD.
4461003	4461784	No Eurobeat.
4462164	4463224	On the CD, so.
4464195	4467557	We're going to play Freedom by B4U.
4468898	4475682	And then we're going to play the original mix of Think You Better D. And then we'll play So In Love Train.
4477844	4479225	So In Love Train.
4480606	4481946	It's the soul train.
4482247	4485629	Alright, so we will... The soul in love train.
4486269	4488831	We'll be back after this break and we're going to talk about more news.

5002093	5002533	Hello?
5003314	5003594	Hello?
5003634	5004355	Is this thing on?
5004395	5004915	Testing.
5006076	5006976	Testing 1-2.
5007557	5011520	I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.
5011620	5012100	Hello?
5012761	5014242	I don't understand this.
5014842	5015623	Does this thing work?
5015643	5017264	This thing reads like stereo instructions.
5017324	5017924	Is this on?
5017944	5018545	What the hell?
5021106	5022527	Orange Lounge Radio.
5022708	5024909	Broke down ghetto Bomani Radio.
5024929	5026070	What the f***?
5027811	5029752	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
5031314	5031894	I believe it
5032318	5037902	I got a comment from the chatroom during the break that we're not our usual chirpy selves or perky selves tonight.
5037922	5039603	We're kind of in a meh sort of mood.
5039623	5040764	I don't feel perky.
5041084	5042705	I think we just all need to get laid.
5044147	5044787	But I did.
5045447	5050571	I mean... Hi, welcome back.
5050651	5053133	There's such things as doors that need to be shut.
5055795	5055855	Um...
5059910	5063991	Anyway, okay, so if you got laid, Jamie, what's your excuse?
5065551	5066472	I'm all tired out.
5066952	5067072	Oh.
5067612	5068392	Oh, you're spent.
5068512	5069132	I see how it is.
5069372	5070213	Oh, you're spent.
5070773	5071513	Oh, me.
5071533	5073453	You know.
5073473	5075614	Anyway.
5075874	5077334	So we're all just spent then.
5077834	5078215	Yeah.
5079435	5079735	I see.
5081127	5082167	Well, I don't know what to tell you.
5082208	5083448	Yeah, we're all in a weird mood.
5083548	5085149	I think it's just the weather or something.
5085529	5086349	I don't know what it is.
5087210	5089831	I'm plenty happy and perky.
5089851	5095273	The rest of you are being... Are you saying we're bringing this show down?
5095293	5096794	You're bringing me down, man.
5098735	5100596	You need to kiss my ass, woman.
5101736	5102537	Not my job.
5102617	5103037	Hello.
5103677	5104818	It's nobody's job.
5106018	5106438	It's alright.
5106699	5107499	We'll get you a puppy.
5110828	5112149	I don't want... Ew.
5114111	5114251	Ew.
5115272	5115432	Ew.
5119095	5120076	You're disgusting, Andrew.
5120096	5121017	I'm glad nobody can hear that.
5122498	5125281	Loki, you wanted to talk about some actual news going on right now?
5129625	5132567	I wish sometimes we were a TV show so you could have seen that throw.
5134629	5136391	Oh, I know what it is.
5136671	5137171	I know what it is.
5137672	5137712	Um...
5139030	5140952	Kitty Joe says, you guys are cranky.
5141352	5144996	And that makes me think, yeah, I think we're just all on our collective period.
5145336	5146797	We're all on like the same cycle.
5146937	5149579	So right now, never mind.
5153843	5156906	Last time I checked, Kitty Joe wasn't a psychiatrist.
5157887	5160048	So shut the hell up.
5160068	5162871	Anyways, actual news.
5163977	5168640	Obviously, first thing would be DDR Extreme, you know, coming out.
5168840	5169601	Oh yeah, that.
5170301	5171642	Oh yeah, we forgot about it.
5171662	5176205	That, you know, that we've been playing the V-Rare songs from and the Consumer Track songs from all night.
5176545	5176906	Yeah.
5177326	5181208	Because, you know, we were kind enough to steal them from Bomani Style because we haven't gotten ours yet.
5182569	5182870	Yeah.
5184991	5186172	I don't have PMS.
5190214	5191075	I do that all the time.
5191741	5192541	Loki, news.
5194642	5195222	It came out.
5197043	5199884	It wasn't a surprise because we knew it was going to come out for a while now.
5200104	5206146	You know what's funny about this is that yesterday, the 11th of October, was actually National Coming Out Day.
5206506	5208906	So it's kind of funny to keep hearing you say, we knew it was going to come out.
5208967	5210407	It's going to come out for a while now.
5210887	5216549	I'm just laughing because I'm thinking of National Coming Out Day and DDR Extreme and how DDR is really gay.
5218687	5245477	Um, but anyways, yeah, there's some songs on there, um, most notably the, um, songs that we knew were there, and people weren't, you know, saying, no, you're wrong, like Max, period, everyone's like saying, no, that's a dumb name for a song, how could that be coming out, meh, well, guess what, it was in there, and so, hi, laugh at you, and then, um, what else, oh, there was, um, a new, um,
5246957	5253538	Well, obviously we found out that the song that everyone liked that we thought was called Overloaded was actually A Stupid Barber, which is a stupid name.
5254618	5256639	It was a very stupid name for that song.
5257259	5263120	And then also, obviously, Undo 12 was in there, which is another one that was rumored to be in there.
5263880	5269821	And Scorched Moon, which I'm sure we'll hear later, was another one that was in there, which is pretty cool.
5270421	5273782	And see, now, what was interesting about the whole DDR Extreme thing was
5274324	5277965	First off, you had a new remix by 2MB, which was Max Period.
5278545	5292250	And second... And second of all, Max Period... Max Period, which was... Don't interrupt, Loki.
5293210	5299412	So, also, you have Max Period, which is, you know, people are kind of hearing that song going, okay, well, is this the end of DDR?
5299552	5300332	You know, is this like...
5301152	5301872	What's this mean?
5301912	5309893	Because obviously when we play it later on, and for those that have already heard it, it's got the part, thank you for playing, and all that stuff.
5310574	5311894	It's a really weird song.
5312454	5315474	It kind of gives you the impression that it's over and done with.
5316295	5320055	There's nothing more other than this compilation crap that's coming out.
5321275	5330497	Now, another thing also, which is interesting, kind of unrelated to the whole thing, is that I was looking...
5331249	5344974	I was looking actually in the Max 2 disc, and you know how you can pull up, because every single remix, or every single game that comes out has a full list of all the songs.
5344994	5352396	It's pretty much a master list of all the songs that are actually going to be in the consumer mixes and arcade mixes and whatnot.
5352476	5354397	So you'll have this giant master list.
5355037	5358458	And Max 2 USA, it's
5358911	5369075	Pretty much a compilation up to DDR Extreme and also with, I believe, the Ultramix, which is kind of neat.
5369715	5381519	But one of the things that I found in there, which was quite interesting, was there's yet another Max remix that's going to be coming out pretty soon, which I have to find my list.
5381719	5382179	Oh, here we go.
5383400	5383660	Okay.
5385396	5388497	Here's one of the songs that was in there that was kind of interesting.
5388677	5394159	It was Maximimizer, which is kind of a weird name.
5394519	5395819	Maximimizer, I guess?
5395859	5397380	Maximimizer.
5398300	5401681	So I guess maybe that might be the new Max for Ultramix, maybe?
5402422	5402722	Maybe.
5403642	5408824	Because I don't think that anyone in their right mind would actually name a song Maximimizer other than Kusami.
5410024	5413145	So that was interesting.
5414639	5416480	But yeah, that's pretty much all the news.
5416500	5418661	Do you want to read these songs that you have on your list there?
5418901	5419281	I'll read them.
5419421	5422363	These are songs that are going to be coming out or were going to come out.
5422623	5424704	Like, for instance, there's some of them that I recognize.
5425104	5427745	One of them, Stronger, by Britney Spears.
5428446	5432227	That was rumored to be in... Euromix 2, right?
5432307	5434649	I don't know if it was in Euromix 2, but it might have been.
5435009	5438030	The Things That You Do, Hula Radio Mix.
5438630	5440311	I think that was also in Euromix 2.
5440451	5441872	Tammo was in Euromix 2.
5442012	5443953	Funk Boogie, I have no idea what that is.
5444389	5447931	Addicted to the Bass, I believe, was Ultramix.
5448412	5451253	Disco 2000, I have no idea which one that would be.
5452434	5454655	It Takes More, I don't know.
5455316	5460179	I Would Die For You, and For You being number four in U. I don't know what that is.
5460199	5463181	I keep thinking of the Garbage song, but that's number one crush.
5463921	5466943	Shake Your Body, which I don't know what it is.
5466963	5468044	I don't recognize any of these songs.
5468164	5471766	One Step Closer is going to be in the new Dancing Stage Fever, I know that.
5472284	5474505	Freak Like Me might also be in there.
5475726	5484091	When You Look At Me is the Christina Milan song from... It's a song that we have in rotation on the station, actually.
5484511	5485551	I recognize the song.
5485632	5487853	I think it's from Euromix, too, I want to say.
5488353	5488953	I think so.
5490534	5493316	Then there's Virtuality, which is another one.
5493336	5493856	Hold on.
5498479	5499239	Tell me it's in DDR.
5499259	5500360	Yeah, it's in DDR.
5501368	5503149	I swear it is.
5503369	5507052	Dizzy, which I don't know what that is.
5507112	5509554	Darn, from back here it looked like dirty and I got excited.
5510575	5512716	2020 Vision, which is, I don't know.
5513397	5515278	Maximizer, which is interesting.
5515418	5518340	Saturday Night Live, or Saturday Night Love, actually.
5519241	5524905	And those are the new songs to expect to see on some... Clarification, what was the Funk B one?
5527647	5527967	What was it?
5527987	5528407	Funk Boogie.
5528427	5528487	So...
5531502	5536286	I have no idea what those are, but I guess they're going to be coming out later on in some release to look for them.
5537987	5542971	It'd be interesting to look at the DDR Extreme list because you're going to have even more of an update list on that too.
5543551	5544792	You can't wait to hack that disc.
5546513	5547234	Yes I can.
5548074	5548615	I can wait.
5549275	5551357	You're going to have to wait until Tuesday at least.
5552538	5552798	Yeah.
5553723	5558165	And that's hoping UPS doesn't say, you know, screw you guys and decide to wait until Wednesday or whatever.
5558385	5559685	No, they deliver the Rockland.
5559705	5560165	That's close.
5560265	5562486	UPS is, you know, fuck me over before.
5563207	5565027	But, yeah, that's all that's new.
5565848	5568449	That and Party Collection coming out, but we already know about that.
5569009	5572190	DDR Party Collection coming out at the end of the year, right?
5572830	5574751	I don't know if I want to fork out the money for that.
5575331	5578472	It's going to have to have the Butterfly video, I figure, in order for me to pay for it.
5578492	5580993	I'll get it, because that's December, so that's a ways away.
5581753	5582354	Yeah, we'll see.
5582614	5582954	We'll see.
5583564	5587427	The next one we're going to be waiting for, though, other than Ultra Mix.
5588007	5589728	I know, I can't wait for DDR Xbox.
5589788	5591890	Is anybody in our little circle going to be getting it?
5591950	5592250	Jamie?
5593391	5594311	Jamie, you're going to have to cash it out.
5594331	5597934	We'll probably have an Xbox by then, because obviously we know that they're probably going to drop the price.
5598234	5602557	Yeah, because as you guys know, GameCube dropped to $99.
5602617	5607921	PlayStation 2 is rumored to be having meetings talking about doing the same thing by next week.
5607961	5611703	And supposedly they sent promotional material to Target already that says, $99, PlayStation 2 is
5613339	5615941	So if that happens, Xbox is going to have to.
5616201	5617322	They're not going to have a choice.
5617342	5618743	They're going to have to drop the 99 as well.
5619403	5622225	And then also those N-Gages, they suck.
5626308	5626789	Oh my god.
5628430	5631912	I was so excited when Dan got me Puyo Puyo for our N-Gage.
5632973	5633533	And you know what?
5634294	5634834	It sucks.
5635054	5636716	And this is me saying that Puyo Puyo sucks.
5637836	5640979	So we're sitting here with our, at least we didn't pay for our N-Gage.
5641239	5641379	Yeah.
5642483	5644824	I've heard nothing but awful things about the N-Gage.
5645164	5646544	Oh, poor Nelly just got beat with a mic.
5647284	5659007	I was going to say... Hey, that's a good quote right there.
5659067	5662648	Orange Lounge Radio, when you taste the suck, you won't feel the pain.
5662668	5662748	Yeah.
5663089	5663909	I like that.
5674024	5676865	I'm going to put a link in there for everyone to see.
5676905	5678585	This is me making fake ads.
5678625	5680705	I'll do one for Orange Lounge and a bottle of Corona.
5681065	5681345	Okay.
5686346	5690027	Yeah, the next one I think we have to really wait for is pretty much Karaoke Revolution.
5690447	5692027	Karaoke Revolution is going to be a big deal.
5692327	5694228	I think Ultramix is going to be interesting.
5694268	5699949	The interesting thing about Ultramix is because of these song packs, we'll be talking about Ultramix three months from now.
5700029	5701729	Like, you know, they released another song pack.
5702225	5704086	I'm actually kind of looking, you know, it's weird.
5704146	5708448	I actually really want an Xbox all of a sudden because I want Xbox Live.
5708868	5710148	I just want a hacked Xbox.
5710168	5711669	Xbox Live is the best thing ever.
5711889	5714030	I want a hacked Xbox so I can download games.
5714070	5714690	And I hate it.
5714710	5718632	This is like me admitting I like Apolitary Song and admitting I like Bag on the Air.
5718652	5720812	We need a hacked Xbox.
5722924	5724606	I don't even know what the difference is.
5724646	5726627	I was just going to go to GameStop and get a refurbished one.
5726687	5728329	Here's the difference of it, okay?
5728369	5735214	We take an Xbox, we have someone hack it for us, you put in a 120 gig hard drive in there, and then you download games for free, baby.
5735475	5735975	Oh, yeah.
5738577	5741720	That's the worst Austin Powers impression I've ever seen in my life.
5741960	5742781	That wasn't a pressure.
5742801	5744062	But you went like, yeah, baby.
5744482	5744903	It's funny.
5745623	5746224	You had to see it.
5749707	5751088	I'm throwing this mic around badly.
5751852	5756098	No, the thing that's going to be real interesting about DDRXbox is the sucky pads.
5757100	5761906	Since we can't plug in, like, ignition, I don't think they make a PlayStation do Xbox converters.
5763048	5763388	They do?
5764029	5764310	Good.
5765331	5766773	I might get an Xbox for that.
5767074	5767915	Then again, I haven't gotten...
5768667	5776033	I'm scared to play Xbox Live with DDR.
5776354	5782038	I can tell you right now my name will not be Sky on there because I don't want you people finding me and seeing how bad I really do suck at DDR.
5782058	5786442	I'm going to have some other name on DDR Xbox.
5787002	5789684	I'll use a disguised voice whenever I talk on the headset.
5789704	5792146	I'll be like, I'll use my British accent.
5793127	5794749	Oh, I'm going to play DDR.
5794889	5795910	Have a jolly good time.
5797171	5797471	Crikey.
5799383	5799883	That'll be me.
5803585	5807686	So, um, yeah, I don't want to like the Xbox, but I'm going to have to.
5807867	5815910	And I really want to play PSO on the Xbox, because somebody left their GameCube PSO for their Xbox PSO.
5816990	5819331	It's because we already had the Xbox Live account.
5819651	5825574	For some reason, they closed my GameCube account, so I just decided that I would play on the Xbox.
5827993	5836576	Maren says she's going to be, if you see a Sky OLR on DDRXbox, that's Maren.
5839998	5842138	The DDRXbox screens look very nice.
5842218	5844960	I'm actually kind of, I'm excited about it.
5845700	5846420	It's weird.
5846680	5847621	They're arrows.
5847641	5849001	I have a picture for it, actually.
5849441	5851362	It's in the GameStop promo books.
5852000	5854302	and it's got like all sorts of characters on there.
5854322	5856004	I'll bring it next week.
5856024	5859467	Dude, the cover of DDR Ultramix is like a big DDR character orgy.
5860649	5861149	Who cares?
5861229	5863031	It's arrows and music.
5863211	5865053	Let it stick to arrows and music.
5865073	5865754	But it's pretty.
5866154	5868096	It's pretty arrows and pretty music.
5868857	5869537	All right.
5877340	5878861	I think we'll take a quick break.
5881382	5882782	And then when we come back, we'll do the cage match.
5885543	5889385	Because our chat room is demanding a cage match, so we will have to give it to them.
5890465	5893686	In this break, I think we will finally play the max period.
5895567	5897028	Because you guys have been dying to hear it.
5897768	5898428	So we'll hear that.
5898868	5901789	We're going to hear a stupid barber.
5901809	5903190	We're going to hear a stupid barber.
5904156	5909858	And then we'll play Think You Better D, the original mix, because I fucked up last time and I actually played I Need You instead.
5909938	5912339	So we're going to actually hear the original mix of Think You Better D this break.
5912680	5915561	So when we come back, we'll do the cage match and talk about more stuff.
5915641	5918202	More news, more fun, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

6127229	6127971	Thank you for watching!
6166337	6166939	Outro Music
6237711	6240574	Come on baby, won't you be my girl?
6240594	6244359	Come on girl, let me rock your world Come on baby, won't you be my girl?
6244599	6249185	Come on girl, let me rock your world Look around, look around, look around now The most important thing
6275801	6285463	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
6285823	6290824	And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
6291604	6297606	Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
6297926	6299786	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
6300407	6305208	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
6325596	6333681	By the way, Max Resurrection and Neomax suck, and they will never be in DDR, and so stop asking, stop wanting, get over it.
6333861	6338903	When real music gets made, it will be put in the DDR, not this crappy fan-made shit.
6339204	6340904	Fuck you.
6340924	6342305	I'm sorry, no one could hear that, you're not mic'd.
6342365	6347348	I said I laughed out so you could hear me.
6347368	6351130	So a little bit of the discussion from commercial break carrying over to the show.
6351190	6351470	What?
6351510	6351830	What?
6351950	6352231	What?
6353171	6353471	What?
6353731	6353972	What?
6354412	6354692	What?
6356843	6363885	You do that again, I'm going to shove that ferret so far up your ass that you'll be pooping ferret noises.
6363905	6372028	That's so easy and never fails to be entertaining.
6372048	6377470	Loki, won't Max Resurrection and Neo Max be in your sim on your big arcade machine?
6377870	6378070	No.
6385461	6387082	You'll purposely be leaving them out?
6389843	6391764	I have like 27 max remixes.
6391964	6393445	I really don't need them.
6393825	6396146	I'm gonna eliminate it down to like three or four.
6396286	6398227	But will the Legend of Trance be in there?
6399328	6400208	Um, maybe.
6401569	6404751	It's pretty long, so of course it's gonna be in there.
6404771	6405511	It's mine!
6406972	6408573	Mine was better anyways.
6408593	6413015	Actually, I do think Legend of Trance was better than the other songs.
6413035	6413535	It's just, okay.
6413995	6415096	Neomax is okay.
6415606	6418507	It's just like they sat there all cool because they're doing like piano noises.
6418687	6419688	It just sounds like MIDI.
6420408	6425650	It's like StarMine, you know, when that was made, that was actually pretty good.
6425911	6434614	I mean, if you get like Onokin, man, to do a remix of like Max 300 or something, or even The Legend of Max, that would be awesome.
6434634	6442558	Because, I mean, obviously, what we're going to see here in the cage match, Onokin did my pick for the cage match last week, and he made Paranoia pretty kick-ass, so...
6443433	6447054	I'd like to see him take on Mac, so, well, try that.
6448134	6448414	Okay.
6448774	6463357	Also, during the commercial break, in the chat room I was talking about, I was poking fun at one of our people in the chat room who's having some trouble typing tonight because they're missing some keys, and I was suggesting some Mavis Beacon, and I was just thinking about, like, how hot Mavis Beacon is, man.
6463417	6464578	She's rawr.
6466878	6469099	Has anyone ever seen Mavis?
6469119	6470099	Just kidding, I'm kidding.
6471055	6473976	How many versions of Mavis Beacon teaches typing have we had?
6473996	6475956	They're on like version 15 I think I saw.
6475996	6477397	You know what?
6477497	6479717	I never ever took any typing classes ever.
6479917	6480638	Me neither.
6480818	6482578	I learned how to type on my Commodore 64.
6484459	6490640	I learned how to type out of the sense of competition with my roommate.
6491380	6494181	My roommate at the time was a secretary and she could type really fast.
6494704	6501269	Well, out of a whole sense of competition and wanting to keep up with people in chat rooms, I can now type at my best at 90 words a minute.
6502651	6505273	That's what Iguana Girl and I used to do when we worked together.
6505293	6510157	We'd have little competitions, just friendly banter to see who could do more issues in an hour type thing.
6511378	6513239	We were the two best workers in that whole fucking building.
6515061	6517423	Even when I'm under stress, I can still type at 70 to 80.
6517463	6517663	Yeah.
6521115	6522656	And I type with perfect grammar.
6522756	6532158	I suggest if you want to learn how to type, you buy yourself a Commodore 64, because those computers are the shit, and they have the computer inside the keyboard.
6532499	6533559	How cool is that?
6536100	6537060	And you can play Donkey Kong.
6537440	6540941	Alright, shall we get into tonight's cage match?
6541821	6542161	Sure.
6546803	6550084	Last week, in the Orange Lounge Radio cage match,
6552478	6559703	Loki's pick won, and he picked a remix of Paranoia called P8107 by, who is it again?
6560744	6562505	Ono Ken, and that was the winner.
6563070	6566813	It won in a pretty overwhelming response by the chatroom.
6566833	6568093	The chatroom really, really liked it.
6568153	6569734	So will they like it two weeks in a row?
6569755	6570195	We'll see.
6570535	6575819	We're only going to play a clip for you guys because it won last week, but nevertheless, you can vote for it tonight.
6575879	6578420	It's song number one, the winner from last week.
6578460	6580101	This is P8107.
6580161	6581943	Remember to vote for the winner in tonight's cage match.
6581963	6589187	You must be in our chatroom, www.calibermani.com, C-A-L-I-B-E-M-A-N-I.com.

6680917	6682859	Alright, hope you enjoyed that.
6683319	6687543	That was P8107, a little clip of last week's winner, song number one you can vote for tonight.
6690005	6690565	Jamie!
6692627	6695850	Jamie, what is your pick for tonight?
6696811	6697371	I forgot.
6697592	6698172	What did I pick?
6698192	6701034	What did I pick?
6701515	6704377	Your song is a group called Turbo Black Cat.
6704437	6706099	It's one I got from Justin.
6708692	6710573	It's a remix of Black Cat by Turbo.
6710593	6711213	It's in Korean.
6711253	6711674	It's cool.
6712514	6713534	Alright, so here it is.
6713615	6715135	Song number two tonight you can vote for.
6715155	6715936	It's Jamie's pick.
6716756	6718797	And you get to hear the whole thing because it's a new pick.
6719417	6723379	It's Black Cat, the history remix by a group called Turbo.
6723499	6724060	Enjoy.
6728342	6728962	It's a dream.
6729262	6731704	It's a dream.
6738968	6740211	Thanks for watching!
6759703	6762504	You're cute, my black cat, your red ribbon looks great on you
6789219	6793084	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6828690	6829451	DarkSakura.com
6881474	6882595	Thank you for watching!
6910845	6914227	Alright, song number two, Turbo with Black Cat, the History Remix.
6914267	6916629	I'm being told that was the pick in Tourney Mix 4, actually.
6916649	6919871	See, I don't know, because I don't keep up with Tourney Mix, and I don't play Step Mania.
6919971	6920551	Well, there you go.
6920952	6921532	But that's okay.
6921732	6923393	I mean, who cares?
6923453	6924934	It's about the song, not about the step file.
6924974	6927096	So, Jamie, would you care to rank your own pick?
6927376	6928136	Eh, I'd give it an 8.
6928217	6930718	You know, it actually wasn't my first pick.
6931178	6937923	When I went to go check how long it was, it was 12 minutes, and I can't edit it down that small, so this was my next pick, and it was pretty good.
6938379	6942370	And one of these days, though, I am going to bring him to you.
6942430	6945780	My thoughts are that's the gayest Pump It Up song ever, and it gets a 6.9.
6950251	6951892	I never did like Black Cat.
6952512	6958976	It was good up to when The Sims kicked in, then it just started reminding me of, like, We Like to Party by the Venga Boys.
6961237	6963538	And the Venga Boys are, like, so 10 years ago.
6964758	6970501	So, uh, I give it a... I give it an 8, because it was alright.
6972162	6974583	It was catchy, but I ignored most of it.
6975724	6976784	Alright, Bradley, what'd you think?
6976804	6978725	I thought it was pretty good.
6983903	6984943	You killed my butt.
6985764	6986324	That's okay.
6986864	6987965	Yeah, that was pretty good.
6988245	6989546	I'll give it an eight.
6990606	6991687	All right, an eight from Bradley.
6991887	6992187	Andrew.
6993807	6994488	It's all right.
6994528	6995088	I've heard better.
6995108	6995828	Maybe a six.
6997749	7001051	Honesty, best policy, put the ferret down.
7003212	7003512	All right.
7004716	7006197	So a six from 23rd Magus.
7006277	7006917	Okay, there you go.
7006977	7007558	Yes, the ferret.
7007778	7008338	But you know what?
7008438	7012441	Our opinions don't mean shit because it's your votes that ultimately decide it.
7012561	7014802	So, you know, it's like American Idol like that.
7015223	7016383	Alright, here's my pick.
7016763	7021446	This is an artist I actually put in the cage match like four weeks ago, I think.
7021466	7023267	You can't pick an... Oh, artist.
7023628	7025809	An artist that I put in the cage match like four weeks ago.
7026930	7031933	But I like this song like three times more than the song that I put in originally.
7032433	7032933	So, it's
7034145	7037247	It's an old favorite family of mine to be put in the cage match.
7037327	7038867	It's Danny Minow tonight.
7039528	7041409	And the song is All I Want to Do.
7041569	7042869	And it's not the Sheryl Crow song.
7043350	7044030	It's even better.
7045171	7045951	So enjoy this.
7045991	7046771	This is song number three.
7046791	7048752	Oh my God, I saw a Danny Minow video at Dave & Buster's.
7049073	7049573	What did you think?
7049593	7050253	She's such a slut.
7051234	7052034	That's why I love her.
7052134	7052714	All right, here it is.
7053135	7055796	Danny Minow with All I Want to Do, my pick for tonight's cage match.
7055836	7056076	Enjoy.
7068422	7072027	I wanna do, I wanna do without you I wanna do, I wanna do
7159248	7159850	Thanks for watching!
7248383	7263853	Take a look inside my heart Tell me what you think you see I may not be the innocent girl that you wanted me to
7326522	7329584	Okay, that was song number three, Danny Minow with All I Wanna Do.
7329704	7330044	Jamie?
7330765	7331185	Seven.
7331205	7332045	It's too repetitive.
7333186	7333887	And she's a slut.
7334967	7335688	I give it a ten.
7335748	7336288	It's awesome.
7336348	7337149	It's the best song ever.
7337529	7337869	Loki?
7339750	7344633	I give it a seven because I've heard that song way too many times because you play it all the time.
7345914	7346755	It's because it's awesome.
7348115	7348456	Bradley?
7350117	7350857	It's okay.
7352938	7353699	I'll give it a six point five.
7357530	7363196	After hearing Angel play it on her radio show all the time, it still doesn't get old.
7363416	7364737	It's still pretty damn good.
7364757	7365097	I give it a 9.
7366519	7366879	Alright.
7367620	7370082	Okay, remember, our votes don't mean shit, though.
7370102	7373545	It's your votes that count, so place vote now.
7373785	7376368	Oh, I'm sorry, we actually have to recap before we place vote now.
7376848	7379370	Song number one you can vote for tonight, last week's winner, P8107.
7387817	7392640	Alright, song number two you can vote for, Turbo with Black Cat, the History remix.
7393181	7397524	Alright, and song number three you can vote for tonight is Danny Minow with All I Wanna Do.
7397604	7397964	Alright.
7416636	7418476	Place votes now.
7418657	7421677	Send those votes to private message to Sky in our chat room.
7426658	7429059	Okay, so we'll tally those votes in a little bit.
7429079	7432160	In the meantime, more witty banter.
7433160	7437341	I thought I'd read this story for you guys and get your thought on this.
7437401	7441582	This is a story coming from BoycottRIAA.com.
7441822	7442542	Oh, that page.
7442642	7443763	One of our favorite websites.
7446835	7447635	Here's the headline.
7448075	7450656	Kazaa plans to end free music.
7451456	7453997	This was sent by one of our chatroom loyalists.
7454697	7457018	Charmin Networks, like toilet paper.
7458659	7464780	Charmin Networks appears to have finally crossed the line with a bid to get into bed with the big five record labels in the RIAA.
7465741	7472763	Kazaa backs plans that could spell an end to the days of free music is the headline in the October 10th edition of Australia's The Age.
7473183	7476504	And Australia is, you'll recall, the place Kazaa calls home.
7477079	7484562	The world's most popular song swapping network, Kazaa, has thrown its weight behind a plan to start billing song swappers for their music downloads, says the article.
7485283	7490365	The proposal, which could finally end the days of the free lunch for millions of music fans, has been put to big U.S.
7490425	7496828	record labels at the same time as the new legitimate version of the former file swapping giant Napster is launched in the U.S.
7497408	7506092	The idea is to phase in a billing mechanism for peer-to-peer networks, such as Kazaa and Morpheus, that allow users to copy music directly from each other's hard drives, she states.
7508223	7517067	What do you guys think?
7518528	7521029	First of all, they have no real way to track something like that.
7524310	7531394	First of all, this is pretty much just like Napster was, where they're focusing just on Napster or just on Kazaa.
7531594	7535796	Don't they realize that people have already left the BitTorrent or WinMX or something like that?
7536417	7545202	They're just going to drop ship on one and go to another sharing service like WinMX or something like that.
7545562	7554688	Trust me, for everyone that comes up or converts over to pay-only, you're going to have five more free ones pop up in its place.
7555088	7556909	There's nothing they can do to stop it.
7557510	7559411	This isn't even a victory on their part.
7559451	7560131	This is nothing.
7560191	7561532	This is just another company...
7561997	7566600	that they're going to try to create that's going to go under super fast, just like Napster did.
7567561	7569682	So, alright, keep trying.
7572123	7576806	Well, what do you think, 23rd Magus?
7576826	7581409	Yeah, uh, sure, sure, let Kazaa go to pay.
7581870	7590295	I'm still going to use Kazaa Light, still going to go on the same network, still going to get the same shit for free, they can't track me, more power to them, I don't care.
7597133	7598153	and the crowd goes silent.
7598173	7599073	Well, Jamie?
7600894	7603474	First of all, I don't use WinMX because it's shit.
7605214	7612516	And it actually has... I've known people, though, who through WinMX have had credit cards stolen off of their computer.
7613236	7613676	Oh, wow.
7613736	7614916	Yeah, so don't use WinMX.
7614956	7615556	I deleted that.
7615616	7616396	I use WinMX.
7617017	7623558	But, yeah, but a friend of mine who is very secure with the systems... It's not the only person who this has happened to.
7624398	7625238	Like, if you have PayPal...
7626701	7628983	It broke into a PayPal account that way.
7629003	7631325	That's why I don't have PayPal save my credit card information.
7631345	7635389	But even so, get that crap off your computer.
7635489	7636550	It's not good for it.
7636910	7638972	And I have a feeling that's how I lost my last hard drive.
7640233	7641974	I'm okay with it.
7641994	7643295	I'm not really using it anyway.
7643335	7644476	I only use it occasionally.
7644576	7645997	BitTorrent is really my main thing.
7646318	7650001	I'm still backing Kazaa+++.
7650401	7652523	My bank has auto protection against all that stuff.
7652543	7654044	Because it doesn't log IPs.
7655014	7657695	It doesn't log your username.
7658395	7659595	It completely changed mine.
7661415	7662416	Yeah, it blocks port 80.
7663676	7666857	I mean, it keeps you protected.
7666877	7667877	It keeps you anonymous.
7668657	7673558	And there can be multiple anonymous at Kazaa.whatever users logged in.
7674218	7675539	It does not keep a track of it.
7676179	7682380	And on top of that, if you actually have it do not link to your files, nobody else can download from you.
7683226	7685087	so they have no way of tracking, no way of knowing what's there.
7686247	7688307	I always thought Kazaa was stupid anyway.
7688347	7689308	I've never used it.
7689448	7690328	I hate Kazaa.
7690628	7691568	The new Kazaa is great.
7692168	7692489	Is it?
7692749	7695429	The Kazaa Plus, it's so, it's absolutely easy.
7696290	7699390	And I downloaded, and on top of that they've even tweaked the program now.
7699971	7703692	I have had 17 downloads going at one time on Kazaa Plus Plus Plus.
7704512	7705112	It's beautiful.
7706052	7706312	So.
7707473	7709173	I'm still a big BitTorrent fan.
7709233	7710353	I think it's the way.
7710373	7711734	I use BitTorrent for my anime.
7711954	7712514	And what kind of
7713360	7718324	And actually, it doesn't even have to be webpages, because you can distribute torrents amongst...
7742984	7744185	IRC Chatrooms.
7745446	7747568	There's nothing they're going to be able to do with this.
7747888	7748889	They're fucked.
7749289	7751411	They're not going to be able to do anything.
7751491	7759898	They better be back in iTunes, and they better do it fast, because that's the only... All I've got to say is, all they're doing is they're just fucking stirring up the hornet's nest.
7760238	7761399	They're making things worse.
7761459	7768104	People are getting pissed, and they're just going to say, fuck you, instead of downloading the one song I want, now I'm going to download the whole goddamn CD.
7770046	7770326	Kitty...
7771499	7773681	Caza Light does not have spyware in it.
7773922	7776224	The original Caza used to.
7776484	7779227	They claim now that it never did.
7779647	7779988	It did.
7780288	7781369	Yeah, it is bullshit.
7781409	7781669	It did.
7781689	7783011	It had massive spyware.
7784813	7787796	That's the other thing that I attribute to the loss of my last hard drive over, too.
7788556	7790298	Adware is our friend.
7791299	7792500	Actually, there's a better program than that.
7792560	7794402	It's called Adware Search and Destroy.
7794422	7794923	Hmm.
7795542	7803807	Um, it hunts down any, not just that, but like basic installers, like for Bonzi Buddy or whatever, and gets them off of your computer.
7804108	7804928	Fucking Gator.
7805729	7812213	I, uh, with the, I had, actually, um, also WinMX does install spyware on your computer, too.
7813894	7814734	Um, yes, it does.
7815255	7820358	Because after, after I was using WinMX, I went and checked, and I had tons of spyware on my computer just from that program.
7822140	7827644	Now, I actually checked about two months after using Kazaa++ and ran the spyware check and there was nothing.
7828765	7830947	Other than what would have, you know, come through like a webpage.
7831227	7832328	But really, it's nothing.
7832828	7833469	Hardly anything.
7834129	7838513	Like maybe 10 files as opposed to the 200 and something before with the old Kazaa.
7838653	7845258	I'll tell you one reason I actually really like WinMxo is that it's the song sharing program of choice in Asia.
7845834	7850536	So a lot of good Asian, Korean, Japanese, Chinese stuff on there.
7851456	7853637	I just... Kazaa, I hate it.
7853777	7854378	I hate Kazaa.
7854398	7854818	I hate it.
7856158	7858079	So, that's just me.
7859460	7859800	Alright.
7860460	7861941	Want to hear tonight's cage match winner?
7862281	7862541	Sure.
7862941	7867363	It was a squeaker tonight, boys and girls, by one stinking vote.
7868764	7874026	Tonight's winner of the cage match by one stinking vote was the one, the only...
7876260	7883246	P8107 That was a close one tonight.
7883347	7887390	Votes were pretty much spread all out tonight, which usually doesn't happen.
7889072	7893976	Oh well, Jamie and I will try again next week to dethrone P8101, whatever it is.
7895438	7898641	P8696969 Alright.
7898821	7901043	I have to think three weeks in advance for...
7901747	7904650	I know, you're going to... Because I'm actually going to be gone the Sunday beforehand.
7904670	7906051	They're going to have your work cut out for you.
7906071	7908092	Because of family deals.
7908253	7909774	Jamie's going to be gone for three weeks.
7909834	7910555	What are we going to do?
7911095	7912957	You're going to pre-tape pump up the volume though, right?
7913277	7917641	Yeah, I might record Tuesday's show and then repeat it while I'm out of town.
7918461	7920223	Actually, the third...
7923352	7924133	on November 3rd.
7924933	7927995	I'm actually taking Monday so I can do my show before I go to Alabama.
7928195	7930116	Yeah, we'll do a show swap.
7930136	7932898	So there's only going to be two weeks where it'll be old material.
7933338	7937500	I'm also going to be doing a special thing that I'm doing as a favor.
7939381	7939982	More on that later.
7940222	7941783	But it'll be replayed while I'm out of town.
7941803	7942443	Okay.
7944224	7945485	And that's really about it.
7945505	7950528	Speaking of our spinoff shows, Monday nights on Orange Launch Radio is Vanilla Sky where we talk about
7951095	7952976	I have an idea for Loki What, Loki?
7985706	7989107	You should do one with the Sierra games.
7989127	7990748	Remember the old Sierra RPGs?
7990808	7991588	Oh, shit.
7991628	7992689	Those were the shit.
7993029	7993969	I'm so there.
7994730	7998191	King's Quest, Police Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, Space Quest.
7998231	7998691	Hell yes.
8000492	8001372	Hell yes.
8002273	8003733	So, yeah.
8003813	8004834	Okay.
8005854	8006675	What else was I thinking?
8007815	8012477	Coming November again, LiveWire on Wednesdays.
8013171	8013932	and many more.
8035943	8038545	One Saturday a month coming in 2004.
8039225	8040146	With prizes.
8040246	8041527	With actual prizes.
8041667	8043168	For our chatroom.
8043808	8048911	Yes, for chatroom and in-studio players.
8049292	8051493	One winner each, so it'll be cool.
8053414	8054595	That's going to be so exciting.
8054615	8060599	So pretty much imagine Starcade with all the video game playing, with a ton of trivia thrown in, that's what you got.
8061081	8062362	It's a very complex show.
8063682	8065363	I have to do a lot of stuff.
8065383	8067024	I've seen the rules for this show.
8067304	8069845	It's insane.
8070906	8071806	Yeah, it'll be fun.
8075388	8075728	I win.
8078529	8080030	You lose.
8082011	8084632	Jamie, would you like to plug what's on Tuesday nights on this station?
8086613	8087033	A cookie?
8089174	8090235	Cookies of doom-doom.
8091716	8092496	It's my show.
8093857	8095218	It's a Triska eating show.
8096839	8099340	Go ahead, Bob, say something and I'll let you.
8099660	8100120	Sorry.
8100981	8107544	Well, Tuesday nights on Orange Lounge Radio at 7 o'clock is the Pump Up the Volume pre-show.
8107864	8110045	And then at 7.30 is... It's Pump Up the Volume.
8111086	8115428	Which is where nobody requests anything because you're all... I'm sorry.
8116328	8119790	Nobody ever requests anything on my show, so I'm like, okay, why am I doing this?
8119890	8120030	So...
8120569	8123712	It's basically where you sit for three hours and listen to whatever I feel like playing for you.
8124833	8130558	If you were in our chat room and requesting songs and I would play them, hello.
8131959	8132359	It's over at 10.30.
8134381	8134801	Sometimes.
8137583	8139145	But that's, yeah, it's some of the volume.
8140005	8140746	My fun little show.
8142528	8142868	All right.
8144489	8148252	I think what we're going to do, we're going to take a quick break and then we're going to come back and...
8149585	8154309	I don't know, we're going to fill 45 minutes somehow with something we'll think is something creative during this break.
8155069	8156691	List list or match game?
8156731	8158312	List list or match game or something like that.
8158332	8159453	We haven't done a list list in a while.
8159473	8165437	You want to do a list list?
8166038	8167159	What subject do we want to do?
8167439	8170341	I know we never did do the top ten names for Comcast.
8171822	8172202	I don't know.
8172703	8176326	I bet for the top three cars you'll never see an initial D game.
8177066	8177907	I don't like cars.
8178267	8179068	And I don't like initial D.
8182392	8184793	So, we'll think of something.
8185213	8190375	If you guys want to suggest a listless topic, we'll be listening for you guys.
8190735	8195057	In this break, we're going to hear Sean the Horny Master with Scorching Moon.
8195097	8200919	That's another Dance Revolution EX consumer track.
8201619	8204060	And then we're going to hear a trance remix of music.
8204140	8205440	And I don't know where this came from.
8205620	8206601	Loki, you know where this came from?
8206741	8208361	The trance remix of music on your computer?
8209202	8210102	Yeah, it came from...
8211385	8214446	It's not a transversion of music, it's the Madonna song.
8214466	8216887	Play a... I think it's a Night In Motion remix one in there.
8216947	8217908	Is that next?
8217948	8218628	Here, I'll pick something.
8239707	8242430	Beatmania does Outphase, Sink Into Trance remix.
8243011	8243291	Lame.
8244052	8244833	Let's break away.
8244893	8245493	Is that any good?
8246975	8251600	How about... We could play something from the Nightstyle soundtrack.
8251660	8252020	I don't know.
8252761	8256365	Alright, we'll play your song from last week.
8256405	8257046	What song was that?
8259549	8259829	Oh, yeah.
8260422	8262083	Oh yeah, the Boom Boom.
8263424	8264385	Tell us about this mix.
8265886	8268588	It's a remix of Enigma because their newest album sucked.
8269568	8270129	So, yeah.
8270149	8273491	Alright, we'll be back after this little break.
8273831	8275672	We'll do Sean the Horny Master and Boom Boom.
8275933	8276413	We'll be back.
8539693	8543556	All right, we decided to say screw listless, and we're going to do the match game instead.
8543616	8545838	So in order to do match game, I need some contestants.
8545898	8547759	So here's tonight's qualifying question.
8548239	8555765	The first two people in our chat room to send me a private message with the answer to this question will be playing in tonight's Orange Launch Radio match game.
8555785	8561469	So I'm going to ask you a question from Monday's episode of Vanilla Sky, Video Game Trivia to Bad Music.
8561569	8562150	So here it is.
8562590	8563351	This is the question.
8563431	8566153	First two people to send me the correct answer will play match game tonight.
8566838	8580220	What was the name of the game put out by Universal, which was similar to Dig Dug, but the object was to collect cherries or kill all the monsters, including ones marked E, X, T, R, and A with your Powerball?
8580881	8587062	The category, just to help you out for last week's Vanilla Sky video game trivia on Bad Music, was 80s video games.
8587442	8588342	So, there you go.
8589662	8590202	One more time.
8590262	8593623	What was the name of the game put out by Universal, which was similar to Dig Dug,
8594079	8601706	But the object was to collect cherries or kill all the monsters, including ones marked EXTRNA with your Powerball.
8602326	8608331	In the meantime, while we get some answers for that, we're going to play another Loki remix here because they're cool and people like them.
8609172	8612915	I want to hear the Big Thunder Mountain mix of Stoic again, so we're going to play that.
8613356	8617299	So we'll be back while we get our qualifying contestants for match game.
8617720	8618120	Coming back.
8758576	8759536	Oh, hello, we're back.
8760277	8761517	Orange Lounge Radio here.
8763078	8767159	And it's time, ladies and gentlemen, to play the Bomani Match Game.
8767219	8768619	How exciting is that, everybody?
8769160	8770040	Yay!
8770100	8774842	I have to explain the rules because we have some new contestants tonight who we haven't had play before.
8777362	8779243	I bet you want to know who those contestants are, huh?
8779323	8780784	Tell us, Rob, tell us.
8782024	8787866	Well, in tonight's Bomani Match Game, we have Zodiac Knight is contestant number one.
8788581	8794703	That's a buddy of mine from LiveJournal, so I'm excited to see that he got the correct answer, which was Mr. Do.
8795103	8795784	We all knew that.
8796224	8799425	Last week, I tell ya, I don't think any of them got it right.
8799645	8801906	None of the people here got it right that Mr. Do was a game.
8802586	8805627	But that was the game with the cherries and the EXTRA monsters.
8807068	8810789	Contestant number two tonight is AZN Buddy Paul.
8811604	8811964	Cool!
8812124	8814566	He got Mr. Dew, and he was second.
8814947	8819130	And just in case, we have a standby as well, if one of them should drop.
8820251	8820591	All right.
8821452	8826696	The way the Monty Match Game works is that I'm going to ask a question, and somewhere in that question is a blank.
8826796	8833200	For instance, the question could be, Arcadian42 went to the store and decided to buy some blank.
8833601	8837504	So all of our celebrities here in the room will write down what they think should be in the blank.
8837584	8838244	Propel!
8838324	8840386	So Propel would be the answer that Jamie went right.
8840808	8846651	Your job is to send me the answer of a private message that you think is going to match with the most celebrities.
8849732	8851273	And I'm supposed to kick nose styling.
8851793	8853414	Why would I kick nose styling, Jamie?

9629768	9633191	Excellent answer and a match for AZM Buddy Paul.
9633471	9634432	I think close enough.

9641078	9643200	If I can find the clip, I'd be glad to play it.
9643240	9643921	Play clip for the obvious.
9644713	9647775	I'm very surprised that I was the only one that went for the obvious one.
9648415	9649436	I think that was excellent.
9649476	9650416	You did an excellent job, Jamie.
9650677	9653318	For those that missed it, you guys, by the way, here you go.

9900437	9901898	But not a match.
9903119	9906041	Close.
9906181	9911524	23rd Magus has a new move and I said it's called the white guy being poked with a cattle prod.
9913826	9915226	I thought that's how he danced anyway.
9915647	9915967	All right.
9917423	9922426	Hey, Jamie, 23 Magus has a brand new elite freestyle move, and it's called the... The seppuku.
9922446	9925008	He joined the suicide circle just to make it work.
9927089	9929270	Good answer, but not a match.
9929451	9932533	So, our final score is... Drumroll, please.
9933913	9936575	Zodiac Knight, with two points, wins!
9937255	9938836	That's like the most points anyone's ever scored.
9938856	9940578	Asian Buddy Paul with one point, yeah.
9941418	9942959	I think two points is like the record.
9943740	9944120	Wait, what?
9944864	9945364	What'd you get?
9945825	9946165	23rd Magus?
9946245	9946785	Oh, you got two?
9947105	9950247	So now you tied with 23rd Magus, who played a few weeks ago.
9950568	9952169	So what does Zodiac Knight get for winning?
9952449	9953069	Nothing!
9953329	9954850	Absolutely nothing.
9956271	9958152	We get to insult you as the winner.
9959213	9961134	You could have done better than two points.
9961474	9962335	You stink.
9962555	9964456	You're horrible at the money match game.
9965737	9966898	You win ferret sex.
9967718	9970760	We give you our everlasting scorn and disdain.
9971501	9972061	Here's what you win.
9974278	9974618	I burped.
9974899	9978159	You win one free coupon, good for going out and getting a life.
9978179	9979320	You can get him some Suck cookies.
9980060	9982781	You win the cookies of Suck, except Andrew ate them all.
9982921	9985181	And what does AZM Buddy Paul win if they run her up?
9986782	9986942	Air.
9987622	9991483	Yes, you win the air around you to breathe and enjoy.
9991843	10000926	And Jamie won't come take it away from you, because you know that if you were somebody else, she would run in the room and go, just to take away your air.
10001877	10003878	So enjoy as the runner-up.
10008701	10013324	And Zodiac Knight is very happy because he loves ferret sex, and he's very happy he won it.
10015265	10018047	Alright, thank you guys for playing in tonight's Bomani match game.
10018087	10018847	That was fun!
10019267	10020628	I want to do that again sometime.
10021168	10022909	That's another bit we can drive into the ground.
10023830	10025371	Alright, we're going to take a quick break.
10026832	10028833	Or we'll take a slow break, I don't know what we're going to do.
10029352	10032414	But when we come back, we're going to be on our way to wrapping up the show.
10032774	10035776	Maybe we'll do some quick Ask Orange Lounge, if there's anything you guys want to know.
10036397	10036957	Sure.
10037938	10040379	Maybe we'll be talking about some good movies we like or whatever.
10042521	10044342	We'll be back in a little bit.
10044722	10052568	After this, I'm going to play... I'm going to play... I'm going to play Max 300.
10055009	10057411	I don't know why, but I feel... Actually, I'm going to play...
10059670	10060411	Yeah, I'm going to play Max 300.
10061451	10062132	What did you want to hear?
10065394	10066475	What's that from?
10067956	10068657	Ooh, you know what?
10068677	10069998	I don't have the original soundtrack on my computer.
10070598	10070778	What?
10070958	10071359	Twinby?
10072359	10072960	I'll do Twinby.
10073520	10074981	I can play something else from Guitar Freeze for you.
10075862	10076142	Alright.
10078104	10082287	Alright, we'll be back after Twin... If I can even find Twinby.
10082327	10083788	Alright, we'll be back after some music.
10088818	10089420	Thanks for watching!
10180304	10181258	Thanks for watching!
10275214	10275855	One, two, three, four!
10275935	10276575	One, two, three, four!
10310238	10311219	Thanks for watching!
10348703	10357310	Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
10357370	10369579	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
10369960	10373002	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
10373662	10376825	What will we learn this week on Ask Orange Lounge?
10377347	10378708	Who's the whitest in the room?
10379068	10380369	I bet you wanted to know.
10381009	10384171	Let me tell you, it's Andrew and Baia, long shot.
10386772	10387153	Alright.
10388754	10396738	Our first question for Ask Orange Lounge comes from AZN Buddy Paul, who wants to know, who would Matt do...
10401581	10407925	If he did lose his big black cock, I'm sorry, what would Matt, not who would, what would Matt do if he lost his big black cock?
10409426	10410226	Loki, can I answer?
10411007	10412508	What would you do if you lost your big black cock?
10415590	10418332	Um, I guess I'd just have to use my reserve big white cock.
10420273	10421694	Alright, excellent, excellent question.
10423435	10429379	AsianBuddyPaul would also like to know, would any of the Orange Lounge Radio staff enter Iron Chef?
10430091	10430391	I would.
10430731	10431292	Oh yeah, me.
10431372	10432512	I'd be first in line.
10432552	10433753	That would be fucking great.
10435313	10437874	Today's secret ingredient is microwave!
10440436	10443677	You know, it tastes really good if you add a nice butter to it, you know.
10444657	10446958	Anyways, I would, yeah, I'd enter.
10446998	10449379	I'd be Iron Chef's superfood, so.
10450680	10450920	Yeah.
10452101	10457243	You know, the thing is, though, is that I could probably enter Iron Chef and fake my way through it.
10457605	10461088	Just because I used to watch all these cooking shows with my grandmother, like the Galloping Gourmet.
10462649	10469595	So, I can cook really good, I just don't... I'm not saying that I'm as good as those guys, but I'd enter that Iron Chef, just to be funny.
10469755	10471876	What would be the secret ingredient you'd secretly wish for?
10476060	10477021	Yes, instant rice.
10479022	10481744	My secret ingredient would be chicken.
10482765	10483686	Maren says propel.
10483706	10485187	Propel.
10485227	10486128	Cooking with propel.
10486593	10491756	Hey, I bet that berry-flavored papel steamed rice would be good.
10493937	10494797	Or lemon-flavored.
10495457	10497999	Next question we have is from, I hope I pronounced this right.
10498019	10498819	My apologies if I didn't.
10499379	10502881	Okyun, O-K-Y-U-N, Okyun, Okyun.
10503301	10505302	Okyun would like to know, how are you?
10507564	10508184	How and you?
10510005	10511846	I'm super, thanks for asking.
10512026	10513086	How am I what?
10514107	10515488	Just how are you, that's the question.
10515528	10516268	How are you, Jamie?
10517500	10520622	Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, how are you?
10523905	10525666	Anybody else care to tell how you are?
10526166	10526887	Loki, how are you?
10530909	10532630	Um, I don't know.
10532811	10535012	I've never really tried eating myself.
10535152	10539055	I think I'd be a little bit chewy.
10539135	10542757	Bit chewy, kind of gristle, you know.
10544618	10546780	If you marinated me just right, though.
10547799	10548660	I'd be damn good.
10548700	10550361	Teriyaki me would be good.
10550381	10553624	I, I, it was, it was Okion.
10553644	10554184	Okion.
10554224	10555405	That's how I'm supposed to pronounce it.
10555425	10557787	Whatever happened to the fava beans and the nice Chianti?
10560529	10561390	Alright, moving on.
10561750	10563031	God damn, no movie references.
10563472	10564473	I, I got the reference.
10565113	10567035	It puts the lotion on its skin.
10568556	10569377	My God.
10570578	10571298	You picked that up.
10574841	10575882	Can't have been much effort.
10576402	10577303	You have something you want to say, Jamie?
10579259	10580239	I don't want to say anything.
10580319	10581300	Go to the next question.
10581360	10581880	Next question.
10581940	10586123	Pip would like to know, wasn't Pip the kid on South Park that was a porn kid?
10587764	10588565	Hello, I'm Pip.
10589505	10590506	When do I get to helmet?
10592247	10596670	Why do American PS2s not play Japanese DDR games?
10596690	10598971	What kind of a dumb question is that?
10601392	10605295	I don't want to mod my PS2, even if it means I would get the better DDR mixes.
10605646	10606967	It's country lockout.
10607127	10608308	Yeah, it's just country lockout.
10608428	10610590	And they do it for the market.
10610650	10612411	Maybe the question is deeper than it sounds.
10612551	10615513	Why does Sony feel the need to lock out the PlayStation?
10615613	10620597	The same way they do for all games and have since the beginning of video game history.
10620617	10621938	But why should they have to do that?
10623919	10625741	Why lock us out of the Japanese game?
10625761	10627362	Market share.
10627402	10628683	Domestic versus foreign markets.
10628743	10629463	It's assy.
10629904	10631024	It's assy and I don't like it.
10631044	10631625	And copyrights.
10632686	10632986	You know...
10633712	10641535	True that with the Nintendo all it was was finding an old copy of Garamite and, you know, putting it on your Game Genie.
10643796	10649518	But still, you know, they've had lockouts since the, I think the Master System had lockouts because of the PIN cards.
10651659	10657762	The PC Engine, you can't even find a good converter to play Japanese Hu cards on a TurboGrafx.
10658562	10661003	Now, however, the games did not have country lockout.
10661043	10663284	The CDs did not, but it was new technology.
10664318	10669000	Well, it doesn't really matter anymore anyway, because we do have all these fancy ways of getting around the country lockout.
10669020	10670081	You know how I got around it?
10670181	10670441	How?
10670581	10671682	I bought a JPS2.
10672722	10674543	I held the shift key while putting in the disc.
10675964	10689231	Now they have this thing, I think they sell it on NCSX, where you pull the lid, it's like a new case that you put on your PS2, and you can lift the lid off, and you have a card that will stop the game from spinning, and you change out the disc.
10689331	10689971	It's really stupid.
10690519	10695162	It's like the old... Remember on the old PlayStation, the multi-swap?
10695882	10696142	Yes.
10696442	10696882	Oh, God.
10697002	10699604	I've seen someone do the seven-point swap.
10700824	10701645	You know what?
10701665	10705707	That's why we had... We bought the last DualShock system that still had the I.O.
10705727	10708228	port so we could use our GameShark.
10708388	10708749	Amen.
10709009	10715632	And we still had the old 101 series, where you know what it took to play import games with that?
10716052	10716873	A paperclip.
10719074	10719334	All right.
10720490	10722491	Let's move on to the next question.
10723351	10726473	Joe Mama would like to know... Dude, there's a name I haven't heard in a while.
10726533	10730934	I know, we haven't heard that from that guy in a while, but Joe Mama would like to know... Can I have a dollar?
10731435	10731635	No.
10732995	10734476	All your dollars are belong to us.
10734556	10736116	Sorry, Bradley would like to say.
10736797	10738377	You can have a dollar if you give me two dollars first.
10739958	10740978	There you go, I like that answer.
10740998	10742259	You can have a dollar when you give me five.
10743740	10744040	Alright.
10745340	10747061	Moving on, Zodiac Knight would like to know...
10748760	10755704	In your opinions, at what point, what number mix, would it be a good time to stop the DDR series?
10755764	10757345	And Infinity is not an answer.
10758906	10760206	That was with Max, thank you.
10761447	10763088	So you think DDR was pretty much dead at 6?
10763348	10765229	I keep playing it, why not?
10765609	10767910	But, you know, it's just the same old thing.
10768070	10771172	There's not really much innovative that they can do with it.
10772473	10772773	Alright.
10773734	10774394	Anybody else care to answer?
10774414	10776055	Of course, I still think the second mix was the best.
10776595	10777716	I have an answer, but I'll wait.
10777916	10778236	Magus?
10782952	10785234	Take it to 9th, make a final, be done with it.
10785754	10786675	Make it like Beatmania.
10787036	10788597	Just take it to 9th, make a final.
10788717	10788997	That's it.
10791439	10792240	Loki, care to comment?
10794382	10796003	They'll just keep making more.
10796444	10803850	And be glad it's still around, because then they're not going to make stupid rip-offs like Brittany's Dance Beat the Arcade game or some shit like that.
10805271	10805351	Ugh...
10806604	10807824	Barney's Dance Magic.
10808185	10809085	I love you.
10809585	10810566	You love me.
10811206	10814967	I'm a drunk inside a suit.
10815687	10816528	Here's my thought on it.
10816548	10818549	DDR should stop at 8th Mix.
10818909	10820129	Extreme should be the last one.
10820969	10823390	Remember how the little thing said... It doesn't make any sense though.
10823410	10824631	It's so cryptic.
10824651	10825851	Nope, this is my thing though.
10827252	10829393	DDR as we know it should be done.
10829813	10831934	I want DDR DX now.
10832054	10833414	I want DDR 2.
10833834	10835355	I want DDR something new.
10836144	10837825	DDR, as we know it, is done.
10838325	10839466	So, forget it.
10839566	10844169	But I think dancing games by Konami are not done yet.
10844409	10848191	And I think we'll see something new, and it's going to be something competitive.
10848271	10849012	I always say this.
10849072	10850813	I say this at least every month on the show.
10851133	10853414	The next DDR should be something competitive.
10853875	10860338	DDR has always been a very cooperative game, with some competitive modes, but they haven't been very... Eh, there hasn't been much to them.
10860719	10864581	Second Mixed Step Battle was maybe the most competitive thing DDR ever had.
10865017	10894035	and then he had unison mode and then battle mode was like nothing that was just another way of doing versus mode but having like a dance magic competitive mode or something more competitive I think is where DDR should go next but who knows what Konami has an idea of maybe they'll surprise me but please god please no sequels to Dance Dance Dance thank you Justin B would like to know will you play my crappy remix so that people can laugh at it he has a new remix he wants us to play
10894711	10897892	We're running out of time on the show, but we'll do it in the afterbirth.
10898132	10899013	And we'll all laugh at it.
10900954	10901854	So stay tuned.
10902454	10904715	AZM Buddy Paul, and this is the last question of the night.
10904755	10906756	Thank you all for participating in Ask Orange Lounge.
10907196	10911758	AZM Buddy Paul would like to know, what do you think about Skye starring in Kill Bill Vol.
10912018	10911758	2?
10914219	10916800	I think that he would probably be the first one killed.
10916980	10919621	Hey, hey, hey, hey, I don't like that attitude.
10921331	10922391	You know what, though?
10922751	10923532	Kill Bill Vol.
10923552	10926792	2 is already done and shot, so I can't really be in it, unfortunately.
10927272	10935994	But I would love to be just some guy that has a cameo that decides to purchase the pussy wagon when all is said and done.
10937495	10938855	The new owner of the pussy wagon.
10940135	10941436	Yes, Loki, you want to answer the question?
10942116	10943516	I would have just shot her dead.
10943556	10944476	She has a sword.
10945897	10947597	Oh, you're going to go ninjutsu on me, huh?
10947717	10947997	Pfft.
10949059	10951320	Indiana Jones all over again, bitch.
10952621	10953461	I don't want to spoil anything.
10953482	10954222	I don't want to spoil anything.
10954482	10956883	But I could say something, but I don't want to spoil anything.
10956903	10957204	I already know.
10957224	10957944	You know what I'm thinking.
10958044	10958804	I already know.
10958964	10959625	So, ha.
10959985	10960245	All right.
10961206	10961526	Yeah.
10961886	10962246	Yeah.
10962747	10963007	Okay.
10963267	10966088	So, thank you very much for asking Orange Lounge tonight.
10966128	10970491	We hope you all learn something, as we do every week on Ask Orange Lounge.
10973693	10974613	I don't feel like singing.
10986972	10987272	All right.
10989473	10996895	Okay, so, well, kids, it's about time for us to wrap up this train wreck of show that we call Orange Lounge Radio.
10997655	10999295	So we're going to get everybody's final thoughts.
10999355	11000356	We'll start with Bradley.
11003016	11003897	I hope I make it.
11005057	11006257	I certainly hope I do.
11008818	11009618	We hope you make it, too.
11009638	11009798	23rd Magus.
11014926	11015306	Boobies.
11017347	11019347	Boobies is your final thought.
11019447	11019888	Thank you.
11019928	11020668	That's so mature.
11023669	11025389	You're such a teenage boy.
11026469	11027950	You are such a teenage boy.
11030831	11031331	Yeah, I know.
11031771	11032231	Yeah, I know.
11032671	11033591	Loki, your final thought.
11034112	11035072	Toga.
11035472	11036432	Toga.
11036772	11037653	Toga.
11038013	11038493	Toga.
11042168	11043610	My final thought is bingo!
11043670	11046172	Did I take your word out?
11065363	11066164	Well, hold on.
11066924	11068045	Oh, you have another final thought.
11068465	11069105	Oh, okay.
11069125	11070206	Well, we'll get to the word in a minute.
11070406	11071106	We'll get to the word in a minute.
11071126	11074728	But I just wanted to thank everybody for listening to and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
11074768	11075869	Without you, we're nothing.
11075909	11076549	We're shit.
11076809	11077309	We suck.
11077329	11078190	We're scum.
11079330	11080491	No, we're still great either way.
11082312	11083753	But no, we do thank you for your support.
11083953	11086294	And thanks for tuning in as you do every Sunday night.
11087014	11089736	And take care of yourself and each other.
11090736	11092137	Tonight's final word goes to Jamie.
11093458	11094038	Lakata.
11096118	11098559	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
11098979	11102900	Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
11103300	11105160	We expect you a nice play again.
11105640	11108461	And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
11109161	11116703	As your leader, I encourage you from time to time, and always in a respectful manner, to question my logic.
11117623	11121784	If you're unconvinced a particular plan of action I've decided is the right one, tell me so.
11122364	11125605	But allow me to convince you, and I promise you right here and now,
11126272	11129835	No subject will ever be taboo.
11129955	11134779	Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
11135720	11143586	The price you pay for bringing up either my Chinese or American heritage as a negative is, I collect your fucking head.
11144927	11146448	Just like this fucker here.
11146768	11148250	Now, if any of you sons of bitches
11151912	11153714	Got anything else to say?
11154094	11155836	Now's the fucking time!
11158840	11164806	I didn't think so.
11166268	11168390	Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.
11198880	11199441	All right.
11199481	11202943	Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio, to Afterbirth.
11202983	11205605	So as promised, this week we covered an Ask Orange Lounge.
11205625	11205765	What?
11205965	11206345	What?
11206505	11206826	What?
11207006	11207206	What?
11207734	11208995	Can I collect your fucking head?
11209156	11210978	No, you may not collect my fucking head.
11213500	11218005	We kind of have to make this a quick afterbirth because we're running to the movie theater to go see Kill Bill for the second time.
11218245	11219587	For Magus' case, the first time.
11220948	11221769	He's a Kill Bill virgin.
11222049	11224650	I encourage you, by the way, to see Kill Bill as many times as you can at the theater.
11225010	11226391	I think this should be the new cult movie.
11226892	11229433	This should be like the Rocky Horror Picture Show Part 2 or something.
11229453	11230994	Wouldn't this be fun to shadow cast?
11231134	11231934	Oh, my God.
11232095	11234716	I'd so be like a member of the 88 Gang.
11235737	11238478	I would, of course, have to take Go-Go's character.
11239119	11239399	All right.
11241380	11241800	Here we go.
11242140	11250065	This is from our very own Justin B. We play things that our chat room builds because we support our chat room just like they support us.
11250846	11251747	The Speedy Mix by Justin B
11297819	11299139	DJ Ranma S S S S S S S S S
11339761	11340543	Thanks for watching!
11398099	11400701	Well, we need to laugh at it now.
11401902	11405444	Ha ha ha ha remix, ha ha ha speedy mix, ha ha.
11406325	11410528	And if Foss hasn't seen Kill Bill by the time we go to Alabama, I'll pay to for her to see it.
11412670	11414291	Of course, I can just upload it to her.
11415875	11418477	Now we don't endorse piracy here on Orange Lounge Radio.
11418757	11420298	We endorse it.
11421019	11427743	Hi, I don't really have anything interesting to say in the afterbirth tonight.
11428403	11429364	No, I have a headache.
11429884	11431886	Yeah, we're just all in a mad kind of mood.
11432206	11433727	We're all in a pissy mood, remember?
11435728	11437949	What I feel Orange Lounge vocal edit, I don't remember.
11438029	11440771	Oh, was that the one where I was going, I feel, or who was it?
11440911	11441472	Was it Loki?
11442352	11442492	Oh.
11442632	11444974	Usually that's my thing, but yeah, Loki does it sometimes too.
11445959	11446319	We'll see.
11447520	11449741	Is Loki going to do an Orange Lounge Christmas album?
11449761	11450121	We'll see.
11453423	11459345	It's beginning to look like Christmas.
11460626	11466989	Somebody in our chat room, I think it was Project DDR USA 2, I think, was making the Strong Bad skin for Step Mania.
11467429	11468269	That should be a riot.
11469210	11470610	Oh, was it BRP Ohio?
11470951	11471311	I'm sorry.
11473452	11474072	Oh, my bad.
11476522	11477042	You're a beast!
11505974	11506515	Eurobeat?
11506775	11507135	Yeah.
11507235	11509517	I don't know if I have any Eurobeat albums, really.
11511858	11514961	Don't you have my CD with the 614 megabytes of Eurobeat?
11514981	11515881	Ooh, I do.
11516042	11516402	I do.
11516542	11516942	Somewhere.
11517242	11517923	Hold on, I'll find it.
11517943	11519444	You have to fill time while I find it, though.
11519784	11520145	Okay.
11520925	11523327	Because, you know, I was supposed to do a Eurobeat marathon, and I didn't.
11524007	11525488	Damn, I feel so bad.
11525869	11527110	Somebody alert Nostalin.
11527330	11528731	I played Happy Hardcore instead.
11529471	11531713	I think it was, like, Volume 7 of Happy to be Hardcore.
11533815	11535616	I need to, like, go back and get the others.
11538181	11539742	I don't think you'll get that CD when you're done with it.
11539782	11542384	Somebody alert Nostylan that we're going to do a Eurobeat marathon.
11542584	11547289	Yeah, make sure that he's got a change of underwear handy or something.
11548490	11550371	Because he's probably going to go through about five of them.
11554495	11554695	All right.
11554715	11556437	The room's already excited about this one.
11556477	11559619	So hopefully the CD's not scratched too bad and it'll play all right.
11560220	11563643	So we'll see what happens here.
11566127	11567487	Alright, I think we're set here.
11567568	11569088	I'm just going to cue up all the music.
11573049	11576571	Thank you once again, boys and girls, for your loving and caring support of Orange Lounge Radio.
11576611	11577331	We appreciate it.
11577971	11579632	And this Eurobeat's for you.
11580612	11583213	We'll go pa-da-pa-da our way to the movie theater.
11583373	11585434	Yes, we're going to pa-da-pa-da our ass off at the movie theater.
11585994	11588795	So, um, is it going?
11590736	11592736	If it skips, I apologize in advance.
11592776	11594877	The CD might be a little skipped, but we're going to do our best.
11595543	11596183	Good night, everybody.
