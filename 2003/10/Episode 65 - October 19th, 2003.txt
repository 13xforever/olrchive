Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the mommy talk and then some.
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
Yes, I will spank your child.
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.
What else?
Here's to my big opening.
A sphincter says what?
Some trooper thinks they're asking.
Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.
What am I doing here?
No.
Dodge this.
This is a tasty burger.
Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.
Yes, I have.
Look, just a flesh wound.
Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.
Oh yeah?
Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.
DarkSakura.
I've got a sniff.
Sky.
But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.
Loki.
I hate you!
Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live.
This is episode number 65 for October the 19th.
Live 65.
Of 2003.
If you thought last week was a blah show, just wait for tonight.
You're tuned in to the Bee Money Scenes.
Most sick radio station of all things.
Bee Money.
Are you sick?
The whole damn world's sick today.
Well, you're always sick, but I mean, like, physically ill.
Not mentally ill.
I'm both.
I'm physically, mentally, and I'm sick and abusive.
Why did I come over here?
I'm past the contagious stage, I'm fine.
Okay, sure.
Can I do the intro?
Can I do the intro and stop?
Won't you people let me do my job here?
Okay.
My name is Rob Roberts.
You might know me as Skye.
Joining me as always are half of my awesome co-hosts.
In this corner, empty corner, the sickest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers.
You know her better.
DarkSakura is out sick today.
I had a sniff.
Now, you tell me, hold on, I'm going to stop this for a minute.
You tell me, if both me, Loki, and Jamie are all sick, what does that tell you?
Somebody here last Sunday was sick.
That's what I'm trying to get at.
I don't know, but I have a feeling you guys are all having sex.
That's why you're all getting sick.
Well, it could be that there's a cult going around anyways, and more than one people, you know, you know, a ton of people have it, because there's people at my work that had it before me.
So, it's obviously not just one person.
It could be totally unrelated.
Especially when you work at a large place like you do.
Or it could be what the most obvious answer is.
It's a government conspiracy to shut us down.
They have had bioterrorists come in and poison our food supply.
Thank God I ate it all.
Yeah, we don't have a lot of time left.
Alright, um...
Oh, hey.
Come in.
Knock on the door.
Yay, another well person.
Hey.
Now we can get him sick.
Now we can get him sick, too.
All right, let me finish the intro here.
See?
She got sick from work, so... Nelly.
What happened to our intro?
You stopped it.
Yeah, but I'm trying to play it again, and now it won't go.
Well, you should have stopped it.
Oh, shit.
All right, well... All right, all right, all right.
Just forget the intro.
Forget it.
Forget it.
All right.
So Jamie's not here, but she is in the chat room.
So if you want to say hello and wish her to get better soon.
Hello.
Our mics are too loud?
I turned them down.
Are they too loud?
I turned them down.
Are they too loud?
Stop it.
Sorry.
Thank you for that.
I haven't even introduced everyone yet.
I think they all know.
Ah, well.
We've got to introduce.
Do the introductions anyway.
Okay, Jamie's out sick, but she's in our chat room.
www.callybomani.com
Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.
Say hello, wish her to get better soon, and watch her berate you over typing instead of verbally tonight.
Alright.
Okay.
In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.
Hello again.
Not only are we sick, but we're bitchy and irritable.
How is it any different than usual?
Also with us tonight, filling in because he's so generous for the lack of a third person tonight, say hello to LankyStyle, also known as Brad.
Hello LankyStyle, also known as Brad.
And then in that corner, say hello to Brad Lee, also known as Arcadian42.
How are you doing, Bradley?
Okay, good.
Usually we'd still have music playing right now, but I fucked up.
He can talk, he can sing.
Wait, I think I can get music back now.
Hold on, hold on.
Yes, there we go.
We'll be talking to all of them more a bit later, but first, we're going to take a quick break.
Don't do that.
Don't do that stupid, wacky DJ stuff.
I honestly don't know how we're going to make it three hours tonight.
I really don't.
Loki says he's got the ideas.
I think I'm just going to turn this show over to Brad.
What?
Which one?
Bradley?
Okay, here, Bradley.
Both of you.
Come here.
Yeah, I'll take the mic outside and we'll just sit there and smoke all night.
And I'll get the sound effects of cigarettes burning.
Hooray.
Oh, Loki wants to take the show outside.
Are you threatening me?
No, we can't go outside.
Then we'll get the outdoors sick.
We'll get kicked out of the apartment complex.
All right, we'll be back.
We've got the money news.
How was your week?
How was your day?
Cage match, FUs, all that fun stuff coming up.
We'll be back.
Will we be together again?
Thought the love we had was strong
Tell me what's wrong, what did we go wrong?
And tell me what's wrong What did we go wrong
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Niko Meow Niko Meow Niko Meow Meow Meow Meow
This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, all ye faithful listeners.
You know what's funny?
During that break, I'd say, you know what's funny?
I looked at the numbers of how many people are listening to the station as we were on break, and I'd say about 15% of them dropped.
Because they probably heard that intro where we're just like, we're sick and we don't give a fuck today.
And they're probably just like, fuck it.
If it's going to be one of those shows, fuck it.
So thank you guys for sticking on board, ye faithful ones.
or just live 365 servers.
Drop them.
Or they're just hardcore Jamie fans and they're pissed that she's not here tonight.
I don't know.
That too.
Most likely that's what it is.
There's going to be a special appearance by Jamie in one way or another.
We're trying to work something out.
Because she's in the chat room.
She's cameoing in the chat room.
How do you have a special appearance?
Is it going to jump through the matrix?
Something like that.
We'll see if we can arrange something later.
We'll see if we can arrange a special visit by a sick Jamie.
And when she's sick, she's twice as bitchy, so if we can get her in for the FUs, that'll be great.
So, anyway... No, it won't require you doing any work.
You're fine.
Because you're sick too, Loki, and I don't want you to have to do work.
Oh, you're not that sick?
Oh, great.
Why don't you do the show while I go take a nap?
You sick bastards.
That's right, I don't get to take a nap because I was playing video games all day.
I was playing Final Fantasy X all day long.
Whoop-de-freaking-do.
Whoop-de-freaking-do, I know.
Good for you people who have American PS2s and can play that game.
For those of you who don't follow along, or I don't know if I've talked about it on Orange House Radio, I know I've talked about this plenty on Vanilla Sky, on the Monday Night Show, but I've been...
I'm rekindling my interest in Final Fantasy X lately.
I don't know, I'm about a year and a half late.
But for some reason I decided I wanted to play it and beat it.
So that's what I'm doing right now is I'm working my way through it.
Someday I should go ahead and beat Final Fantasy IX.
I never beat IX and I never beat VIII.
We probably should tackle that someday.
One of these days, it was like the last Final Fantasy I actually had the patience to beat was 7, and 8 like turned me off to Final Fantasy so bad that I didn't even buy 9.
Bet you didn't even go to Sea Spirits Within, did you?
No, I went to Sea Spirits Within and it made me even sadder.
So, that's basically what happened.
Anyway, so, on that note, let's play How Was Your Week and How Was Your Day?
I don't like Jury Duty.
I don't like downtown Sacramento, and I don't like the fact that Jury Duty is in downtown Sacramento.
and uh... the whole week sucked it was hell and no it'd be nice to say oh well you know jury duty's done so I get to you know go back to my work but no I have to go for the next at least two days so that sucks and I don't want to be there and but I gotta sit through it and do my quote unquote civil duty civic duty civic civil I don't give a crap think of a car Honda
So, you know, that's what I gotta do.
That was my week.
It sucked.
I had the worst day ever on Wednesday.
I just didn't care when I got back.
Then Thursday was alright because we got off at noon because they're still picking the jury because it's slow.
And then...
Yeah, I know this other thing.
They didn't kick you off the jewelry?
They didn't, like, say, sorry, go home?
No, they actually put me on there.
Wow, I, jeez, I got kicked off when I was on there.
Yeah, well, you know, they still have to go through, like, pretty much the way I figured, because I've never really been in one of these things.
They've got, like, 27 people they pick, you know, first, they go in there, and then they kind of go through and eliminate people until those 27 people are all gone or either on the, um,
No, jury thing.
In the jury box.
So, there's, like, still another, you know... They've only eliminated, like, four people so far, and there's still, like, another 13 people in the audience still, or whatever.
Jeez.
You know, and... So, I mean, there's a chance that, you know, I might get kicked off, but... Probably not, because my luck never runs away.
That's crazy.
So... Four people a day.
It's supposed to only take two hours, and it's taken...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thursday, they did it from 9.30 to, you know, 12.
So, I mean, that's... And still haven't eliminated them.
And they still haven't eliminated the people, because... They did it, like, in 20 minutes.
I'm like, I don't understand what's taking so long for this thing.
But, supposedly, they promised that the trial's supposed to be short, so... Yeah, right.
Well, they've only got, like, four witnesses, as far as I'm aware, and so, I mean, that shouldn't take too long.
3D sucks.
Yes, yes, yes.
I just don't like downtown.
Didn't you mention when you were on the stand or whatever that you actually did a show called Orange Lounge Radio that you're a part of?
Yes.
Great, the government knows about us.
We're fucked.
I don't think they care.
Oh my god, you said that?
It was funny though, because the prosecution, or no, the defense attorney asked me as one of the questions, because they're pulling you and asking you questions when you're on the box, because I was talking about, they're all, so what kind of music do you guys play?
I'm like,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So you said you were actually on a, did you say you had talk radio?
Yeah, and I think they would take that as, okay, we shouldn't have him on the jury, because he might go ahead talking about the case.
Well, I mentioned there was a talk radio station, and then I also, what was it, I mentioned, I was going into it, I guess I went into it a little too much, because the judge was like, did you want to give out your URL while you're at it?
Did you?
No.
Damn it!
Holy shit.
That would have been great.
No, but... Damn it, why didn't you have the business cards?
We have the business cards.
You could offer the judge a business card, he would have gotten kicked off the jury right there.
Come on.
And he would have had our URL.
No, I'd rather not.
But anyways, the defense attorney, though, she knew what we were talking about.
She's like, so what kind of video games do you guys talk about?
I'm like, oh, mostly the music games.
She's like, oh, like that game where you step on the arrows?
Wait, wait, I just have to ask real fast.
Did you have to define what speed music was?
No, I did not.
It's a bunch of crap!
It's a bunch of crap!
I didn't give it out to the whole jury because half those people I don't think know what a computer is.
Were you being interviewed in front of the other jury members?
Oh yeah, the whole people.
How many people were there?
About 27.
That's all?
Well, not including no jury.
Well, not jury.
Not including the attorneys, the defense, the defendant, and all the judge, the bailiff.
So basically you have no shame.
No.
I couldn't get up on the stand and say that I do those things.
Sorry.
I'd so be ashamed of this because they come on here and they find out what a big fag I am in like 15 seconds.
I don't know, for some reason... Wait, would they kick you off the jury for being a homosexual?
No.
Maybe if the case has something to do with that.
Like, they don't... Usually they'll pick a jury and they ask you questions and they're looking for things that may give you a biased opinion during the jury.
But here's the thing, though.
It's like... I don't understand about much... I don't know much about how the jury system works and everything, but...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
It's pretty much like that.
And they keep asking the same question until they finally said no.
It's because they can't lead the witnesses in the case, so they just lead the jury members to pick the ones they want.
It's a very slow process.
Very slow.
And I hope to God that we actually start the trial on Monday because...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And so, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, lunch comes, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, it's almost time to go home, it's 3 o'clock, we get to leave at 3.30 if we're not called in, and we're done.
We're done for good.
So, as you would know, at 3.15, they call in the last group, and my name is the last one called on that group.
So, it's like, fuck.
I'm like, okay, settle, settle, settle, settle, no.
So...
I hope you get sequestered.
That would be funny.
It's not going to happen.
I don't think so.
What little I did find out about what's going on, it's not that big deal.
Well, I mean, to somebody it's a big deal, but, you know, it's not going to be on the news or anything.
We're not talking like a high-profile case.
It's just...
Well, yeah, you would have been able to tell as soon as you went in there.
I mean, they have a completely different type of process.
I don't know.
I just want to be out of there.
You know, it's not a matter of, like, I don't like jury duty.
It's fine.
I just really hate downtown SAC.
I hate driving down there.
Honestly, I hate everything about downtown SAC.
It is impossible to find any place to eat down by the jury place.
I walked around blocks just looking for, you know, a restaurant.
It just sucks.
and then, you know, in fact, I have to get there two hours early in order to get a parking space, you know, a free parking space.
Otherwise, I have to pay $6 a day, you know, for parking.
No, they don't.
Yeah, way to go, city of Sacramento.
You rock, you know.
Not only do you pay me only $15 to go to Jury Duty, but half that money is going to go to parking because you don't provide enough parking.
How fucking lame.
But, um... It'll all be over soon.
Hey, I got it good.
I mean, there were some people there, they were talking about like, some of the jurors that were there were talking about how they got to sit on another trial, and they were going to be picked on their own.
One of the, you know, they were asking if anyone has any hardships, you know, normally involving the trial, like it's going to take too long or something.
One of the trials was going to take three weeks.
I was like, oh, thank God I wasn't on that one.
Oh, that would have sucked.
Oh, no way.
I wouldn't have done it.
I'd be all, sorry, I'm on vacation next week.
No, I'd be like, my work's not gonna pay me.
You find out what the case is about, and then you make the most stupided statement that make them totally think that you'd be the wrong person to pick.
Like, say it's about a gay person being, you know, beaten up, that you say that you're a freaking anti-gay, you know?
It doesn't work that way.
It doesn't work that way because they tell you from the beginning what the case is gonna be about.
You pretty much can, it's just...
It's really the whole system is flawed the way they do it.
But I guess it works because they have so many trials a day.
But it doesn't make any sense because it's like, well, any idiot can find a way out of it.
It's just, I guess, on the honor system, which isn't worth much nowadays.
Yeah.
I don't know how, I guess I was just too young, because I think I got called in, like, on my 18th birthday.
I mean, I swear, it was like, as soon as I could go to jury duty, I was called.
And they were just like, I think they just thought I was too young, and they sent me home.
I was like, thank goodness, I don't want to be here.
Well, it's like there are people, like, they're all, what kind of...
I don't even know how they can have a hardship.
The trial's going to last like two days once they get the jury selected.
And you're like, oh, poor me, poor me.
I'm not going to have enough money to make rent because I missed two days of work.
Well, that's kind of how it is for some people.
Oh, well.
I mean, and you miss rent and it could script your life.
I mean, it's not just any laughing matter.
I think it's a bunch of bullshit the way I have it set up.
So anyway.
Yeah.
Rice Princess is suggesting if you wanted to get out of jury duty, you could have told them that you make sweet love to sheep.
That doesn't have anything to do with the trial, though.
So that wouldn't work.
Yeah, how would they ever find a juror in Chico if that's the case?
That's what I want to know.
Anyway, anything else you want to say about your day and your week?
No, I really didn't do much.
I just was, like, so preoccupied with this stupid jury crap that's, like,
I thought it was going to rain today, and I looked outside, but according to the weather, it's not going to rain for a while.
And, um, I don't know.
It's just supposed to get warmer.
It's supposed to be like the 90s.
Ew.
I don't know, I'm just pretty much just doing like running around and stuff today.
I went grocery shopping because I needed to do that and that's about it.
I was supposed to try to find a Halloween costume because I had to go to a party.
I don't know if I'm going to
You haven't figured out what you're dressing up as yet?
I had an idea, but there's just a problem is no one seems to have the costume that I want.
Um, I had a couple ideas.
First off was, um, the Mad Hatter, which is kind of cool.
Um, just do like an evil Mad Hatter type thing.
I could probably do that, and it's like, eh.
Then I could dress up like Neo from Matrix, because I already have a trench coat and glasses.
But really, it's the wrong kind of trench coat and stuff, and...
That would kind of suck.
Then my other one was the charred corpse of an astronaut.
You are horrible.
So I thought that would be kind of cool, because all you have to do is find an astronaut costume.
But you know, you'd be surprised that there's not that many out there.
I guess no one wants to dress up like an astronaut this year.
I hope you wouldn't be seen in public with that on, because you'd get beat up by somebody.
Oh, by the astronauts?
Wait, they can't, because they're charred corpses.
You're horrible.
I said you should have been a princess.
I didn't want to be a princess.
Because that would be ironic.
My co-worker is supposed to dress up like a dominatrix.
That's kind of cool.
Except she wouldn't be a good dominatrix.
Now our other co-worker is the slut.
She'd be a good dominatrix.
But that's all.
Okay.
Don't give me the microphone.
After comments like that.
I'll talk about my day and my week.
But first, I have to address the chat room because they're talking about me in there.
It's not funny.
Yes, it is funny.
No, it's not.
Yes, it is.
Because I look like absolute shit today and I don't even know why I'm sitting on the cam.
I should take the opportunity to sit in Jamie's hidden blue chair while she's not here.
But for whatever reason, I'm lazy.
I don't feel like getting up off the couch.
And I look really ugly today because I haven't really taken a shower.
Shut up.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't even want to dignify that with a comment.
Did you read it?
Yes, I did.
It's funny.
I can read the chat rooms.
Well, everybody in the chat room is listening to the radio show, so they already pretty much know.
Some people in the chat room, well, not everybody who listens to the show gets in a chat room either, which just makes me sad.
Okay, for those not in the chat room, never mind.
That's right.
It's really too disgusting to say on air anyway.
That's a good bread.
I'm dissing you.
You're not supposed to say that's good.
I don't want to talk about it.
Joke's on you.
I don't want to go there.
Neither do I. The rest of my week was really pretty boring.
Tuesday and Wednesday was DDR Extreme most of the afternoon because we finally picked it up on Tuesday.
But we'll get into that later.
We'll talk about DDR Extreme later.
Yeah, I was so bored on Thursday.
I played that damn game all day.
And you know what?
That's the only time I'll ever play that damn game.
So it was nice while it lasted.
Extreme is disappointing.
Very disappointing.
We'll get to that later.
Oh, we are?
Yeah, well, we need topics to fill three hours, so let's not blow our load all at once here, please.
You're a dick.
Anyway, and then Thursday I started feeling sick, so I didn't really want to do shit after that, because Thursday I had to go run errands out in Roseville.
I didn't even bother to go by Golfland.
And then, God, what the hell...
I was supposed to go out Thursday night and I didn't because I was feeling sick.
You know what, I did go out last night though.
I went out dancing last night and it was kind of interesting because I was hearing all these new Bomani songs that they were playing.
Like the DJ at the club last night, oh no, Friday night, I meant Friday night, not last night.
My bad.
Friday night I went out and the DJ there was really really horrible like he was mixing songs together like not how you know most DJs mix songs together how they transition one song into another oh like I do
Yeah, but no, it was different, no.
He put Gravity in the background.
He didn't put Thought, yeah, no, he wasn't mixing Gravity into it either.
He put Thought, he didn't put any Thought into it.
He would just mix two records together on top of each other.
Oh, like I do.
Anyway.
But, like, no, what's funny is that I'm thinking about all these, like, new Bomani songs he was playing.
He was playing a song that's going to be in DDR Xbox, that Shiny Disco Ball song.
Oh, God.
Which I know we talked about a couple weeks ago on here.
And then he was playing Sandstorm, too.
And he was like mixing these two songs together.
It really, really sucked.
Like it was... Late Night, Disco Balls.
Shiny, Disco Balls.
Late Night, Booty Calls.
It was really awful.
People like that are getting jumped.
He was obviously new.
Loki, you should be a DJ.
You could be a DJ at a gay bar so easy.
Hey, what do you mean by that?
I just mean, you know, because you like gay music, it's alright.
Hey!
I'm just kidding.
My music is pure hetero.
You're the only straight guy I know with a Madonna vinyl.
It's not a professional DJ already.
I have more than one.
I have like three or four of them.
You're just making my point.
It's the My Girl Likes to Party All the Time record that really scares me.
He says he's guilty there.
Yeah, but that's not gay.
That's stupid.
That is so gay.
That's stupid.
Exactly.
And you're gay, and you're stupid, so it works.
Yes, DarkTetsuya in the chatroom says, shiny sandstorm balls.
That was it.
Shiny sandstorm balls.
Is that about something?
Shiny sandstorm balls.
God, what other... I was hearing a ton of, like, new Bomani songs at the club.
Like, I heard Love at First Sight, Stomp to My Beat.
You know, all these ones that you hear in... Well, they're not really Bomani songs.
They're not, but, you know, it's still neat to sit there and go, Oh my God, that's in DDR.
I don't know.
It's not quite what it used to be.
When he plays Max Period, I'll be like, Okay.
Yeah, you're right.
You're never going to hear a Konami original there, but... I wish.
I would love to hear Ecstasy at the dance club.
That's one thing.
But I remember, like, when I was first getting into DDR, back when, like, DDR USA was the only game there was to play, right?
Well, you know, around here, USA was the only game there was to play.
I remember going out to the club with a couple of Bomani friends, and we heard Stomp to my beat, and it was like, yeah!
Am I the only person who heard Stomp to my beat before it came out on DDR?
No, I had heard it before, too, but it got better.
You used to listen to it all the time when we played Cusar.
Yeah, I mean, they used to play it on Power 105.5 here all the time.
Which is just a local thing to say, but... That's right.
There was a radio station that used to play dance music, and it was big before DDR was around.
And too bad the damn station isn't around anymore.
It was the best station this town ever had.
Now it's Power 105.5 The Fish.
No, it's No Power 105.5 The Fish.
It's possible, I mean, because...
They are... That's the kind of stuff they would play.
A European... Anyway.
Hi, I'm off on a tangent.
Let me come back now.
What are you saying?
Yes.
Stomp to my beat.
And when we go to the club, and now it's in DDR.
So now we already like stomp to my beat.
Now it's in DDR.
And we'd be at the club and we would actually do the dance.
Well, like we do it where we go step, step, step, step, step.
Like, just like it was in stomp to my beat.
Like, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.
Left, left, left, down.
Anyway.
I'll shut up now.
I'm leaving.
No!
You scare me.
No!
Alright.
So you did, uh, Riverdance, basically.
RicePrincess says that the first time she heard Stomp To My Beat was when she went to go watch Strippers.
I don't know if that's the first, but she heard it.
That's kind of weird, though, to have them play that in a strip club.
Hey.
Stomp To My Beat, stomp on my face.
I mean, I don't get it.
Sit on my face.
She was sitting on my face.
Okay, that was really bad.
Stomp on my cock.
Stomp on my cock, Loki says.
No, thank you.
I guess I'm done.
I think that's it.
Yeah.
Oh!
Oh, Jamie's reminded me of another time we heard Stomp to My Beat.
It was when, um, you remember when we, like, all the Sacramento people used to go to Roseville Golf Land every, like, Thursday night or Wednesday night?
It was one of the two nights.
We used to go every Wednesday, Thursday night.
One time we were at Brookfield's and we heard Stomp to My Beat in the kitchen.
Oh my god.
We had an oh my gods, it's DDR moment.
Alright, I'll shut up now.
Brad!
How was your day?
How was your week?
That's pretty much it.
No, uh, fuck, nothing really.
I just, I've been playing PSO.
I don't know why.
I just have this urge to play PSO again.
And not online because I'm playing on Dreamcast.
And that would be Phantasy Star Online for the uninitiated.
If anybody doesn't know what PSO is, there's something wrong.
That's like saying, what's Auro?
What the fuck?
What's EQ?
What's... L-O-Z.
GQ, that's that magazine for men, right?
I'm a little late, but hey, they're good.
You have a weak mind.
You've been sucked into the Harry Potter.
They're actually very good books.
No, I know.
I remember when the first book came out, and hardly anybody knew about the book.
Only my friend's little brother was reading it, and it started to get bigger and bigger, and I was like, what is this thing?
Then he had this Harry Potter birthday party, where all of his friends, they decorated the house like a Hogwarts house,
If you know what that is, I'm pretty sure most people know because it's in the movie.
Anyway, and I was just like, what is this?
This is so stupid.
And by the time I know it, everybody's reading it, and I'm still skeptic about it, and the fourth book is out, and I'm just like, whatever.
And then Jamie, thank you Jamie, she buys...
Irene and I, the box set of the four books, the fifth book hasn't come out yet, and we had watched the first movie, and I really liked it, so, you know, we watched the second movie, I really liked it, and I finally got around to reading the books, and the books are so not kids' books.
They're geared towards kids, but I think there's a lot of things in the books that aren't, like, kids wouldn't even understand.
It's really, some of it's pretty complicated, so, good stuff.
No, there's no hardcore sex, Loki.
Okay.
Well, actually, I don't know.
I haven't gotten all the way through the fourth book yet.
You're thinking of Harry Cooter, not Harry Potter.
Harry Cooter.
Yeah, I haven't gotten all the way through the fourth or fifth book, so I don't know.
I can't say, but I'm sure there's a lot of people out there listening right now who have even read them all, so... Whatever.
No spoilers for me.
I'll just wait until the movie comes out and you can see Harry Potter having sex with Hermione while Ron sticks him up the ass.
I don't know.
With his wand.
You could probably download... Stick to his wand.
You could probably download that fanfic somewhere online.
Yeah.
Let's ask... Jamie might know where it is.
Jamie knows where it is.
You're going to get beat for that one.
Alright.
Okay, I have searched for pictures for the new movie coming out, the third movie, on Harry Potter.
And what comes up on Google Images?
Harry Potter doujinshis.
Which are like pornographic mangas.
I don't even know why people bother.
Let's see what Mario and Luigi look like when they're having anal sex.
Is that all you have to say, Brad?
Yeah, pretty much.
Alright, then let's ask Bradley.
How was your day?
How was your week?
Hey, how's it going?
Oh, that Bradley.
Monday through Wednesday, I actually did some work for one place.
Basically, I had a big stack of papers.
One was in order and one was not, so I had to take one stack and reorder it to get it ready to put with the other papers so that we could stuff it in envelopes.
So you got paid to shuffle papers?
Yeah, shuffle papers and throw them in envelopes.
and so on.
My cable got cut off because I haven't paid them yet for a while.
So I'm going to die low for a while, which sucks.
Sucks majorly.
Especially if you need to have people calling sometime for maybe interviews or something.
So I have to keep it off during the day when I have to take everything.
So that's kind of a bitch.
Saturday went around shopping and such.
and the limited money I have.
What'd you buy?
Just some detergent.
Day-to-day necessities.
I know, because everybody out there listening to the show wants to know what kind of detergent you use.
I want to know what kind of detergent you use.
I bought Cascade.
Cascade?
Wait, wait, wait.
For dishwasher detergent?
Yeah, yeah.
I have a... This will help everybody out there who has an apartment or house and actually has to do dishes.
Do not buy
Any name brand detergent for your fucking dishwasher.
I found out that Walmart brand Sam's Choice detergent from Walmart is better and cheaper than any other detergents out there.
And I've used pretty much every freaking kind of dishwasher detergent.
I used to use Electrosol, Cascade.
It would not clean anything.
Even if I cleaned the dishes before I cleaned the dishes, it still did not clean them.
But the Walmart, the Sam's Choice detergent
Fucking kick ass.
It's cheap, too.
Wait, there's two hands grabbing for the mic.
This is the most uninteresting topic ever, but I'm actually interested here.
So, you just know this based upon experience, or do you have the scientific data to back it up?
Okay.
Okay.
I found the idea from, they did a news report on why can't they basically get, this is how boring our local news stations are.
We can't figure out, they do this will it work Wednesdays thing or whatever and they try to see like which, they compare products to see if they really work well.
And they were saying, you know, here's the expensive brands and they did like tests.
And now, I don't know if they made the fake tests or not, you know, but basically they said their opinion was to use this specific brand, this Walmart Sam's Choice brand.
And I mean, I don't know if they're faking the test or not, but I said, I'll give it a shot.
And I have had nothing but bad results with other, I always thought it was my dishwasher that couldn't fucking wash the dishes.
But no, I go, I buy the Sam's Choice stuff, and it works better than any other kind of detergent I've ever used.
Probably because it has toxic substances in it, but who knows?
Who cares?
Yeah, good luck killing the Earth.
Your dishes come out with a nice glow to them.
Thanks for killing the Earth, Brad.
I know, it's all... I'm single-handedly destroying this planet, and I feel good about it.
Because I can eat off a clean plate, so fuck you.
Even if my turkeys grow three eyes.
Wait, turkeys, what are... I don't know, here.
If turkeys are growing extra limbs, that just means more food for me.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Supposedly, that's how KFC makes their chickens.
They have, like, no feathers, no beaks, huge bodies and tiny little legs.
KFC's doing something fucked up, because we all ate there the other day, and I swear to God, we were all like this afterwards.
We were all, like, clutching our stomachs, like, uh, chemical poisoning.
Thanks for watching!
A factor for that.
But, um, no, I think I was sick because I was, like, starving.
I hadn't eaten anything all day except for popcorn, a full thing of popcorn, and then I had a bunch of chicken.
And then later on that night, I had a, um, really hard, um, parmesan twist from Roundtable that were sitting out on the counter for three days.
And then after that, I'm all clenching my chest going, why am I not feeling good?
So...
Lesson for life, kids, don't start off the day with eating a bucket of popcorn.
It's never a good way to start.
Yeah.
Were you done talking about your day and your week, Bradley?
Yeah, I didn't do all that much other than that.
Other than Wednesday coming over here and playing some DDR Extreme.
That's right.
I forgot to add one thing.
Hmm?
I forgot to add one thing about my week and my day, and that is that on yesterday morning, I went and saw Kill Bill for the third time.
Thank you.
Because, shut up!
You were with me!
Screw you!
I know we missed the Pyramid tryouts because we had to go see Kill Bill again, so what can you do?
But Kill Bill was just as good the third time, and I will be going to see it at least a fourth time, if not fifth and sixth.
Because I'm sick.
So, anyway, before we get to the break, I got over the chat room
A message from Jamie.
She would like to share how her week and her day was.
So Jamie, how was your day?
How was your week?
Well, Jamie says, my week equals work.
My day equals suck.
And no Bomani, because I'm being frugal.
There you go.
All right.
If no one else has anything to say for right now, we're going to take a quick break.
And we're going to come back and we're going to talk about DDR Extreme because we all got to play it this week.
And we certainly have a lot to say about it.
So we'll get to that when we come back.
In the meantime, enjoy this break.
We'll have some Casey and the Sunshine Band from X2USA all the way to Sean the Horny Master.
We'll be back.
Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
Howdy, folks.
We're back.
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 65.
The sick episode, because Jamie's out sick tonight.
She would have tried to really...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Oh, you're looking through the peephole, Loki, huh?
What do you see?
Are there naked people out there?
Oh, just Brad.
Damn my phone!
Oh, is Brad talking to the neighbors?
Yeah, we have some interesting neighbors, because our neighbors upstairs to the left, they're big anime fans, so they think what we do is pretty funny.
They like to make fun of Loki and his DDR pads that he's building outside.
What did they say?
I was commenting to them the other day about how Loki's building his machine, and I commented something like, oh yeah, they asked me, where are you going to put it?
And I said, oh well, Loki's going to get rid of the TV and kind of put it in its place, because the cabinet's going to be a television too.
And they were kind of like, oh, there's nothing like watching Loki playing some DDR.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Fuck, I missed something.
They're talking in the chatroom about your neighbors are on drugs.
Well, because I just talked to your neighbors out there.
Okay.
I'll tell you later.
I'll talk about it later.
Anyway.
Extreme.
Sucks.
I didn't really care for Extreme.
The last machine I was really ever excited about was Max 2.
Extreme came out in the arcade and I thought it was really cool they put Sakura in there and Zenon and Daikin Kai and
Miracle Moon, LED Style, like, those were a few good songs, but the most of the songs in the machine sucked.
Okay, now, the home version comes out, and I hear, you know, the songs that are gonna be out on it, the unlocks, I heard them pretty much before, like, I got to, yeah, I heard them before I got to play the game.
I got to play the game, the steps on all of them pretty much suck.
Some people will disagree with me, saying, like, Scorching Moon steps are cool, I think...
I don't know, I think they're being really non-innovative with their steps still, and I mean, there's only so much you can do.
There's only so much you can do, but still, like, they gave them all easy difficulties except for Max period, but we can talk about that later.
Hasn't Konami kind of been doing that with all the new songs lately?
I mean, people were bitching about Max 2 USA kind of had shitty steps too.
Well, that's because those steps are made in Hawaii, I believe.
Konami Hawaii makes those steps.
This is from what I understand.
Konami Hawaii does everything about the Xbox.
This is just how I understand it.
I could be wrong.
From what I picked up, Konami Hawaii only does everything relating to the Xbox game, and I mean everything.
Konami Hawaii has completely developed the Xbox and computer versions of DDR.
There's kind of a debate whether Konami USA is making those steps or Konami Japan.
Some people think it's being done in the U.S., some people say it's Japan.
I guess people don't really know.
There's a different style.
There's obviously a different style to the steps on the American-only songs that don't show up in other Japanese games, you know.
I can tell there's some sort of difference to them, so I'm thinking they're done by somebody else.
But still, the thing is... What was I going to say?
Sorry, I'm getting sidetracked by some of the stuff that's being talked about.
Then don't look at the chatroom.
Look at it when you're done talking.
There's important stuff I want to talk about that they keep talking about.
Oh, alright.
Anyway, I'll get back to that later.
Okay, um... Shoot.
Anyway, yeah, the steps for these new Unlocked songs were kind of ass.
I love Scorching Moon.
I mean, I pretty much like all of the Unlocked songs on Xtreme except for Max Period, which, what, leaves three songs?
Undo Toi, Scorching Moon, and Stupid Barber.
Pretty much.
Those were all good songs, and it was pretty much up to how the steps felt, and the steps didn't feel right.
Max Period was an extreme disappointment.
In my opinion, it seems like they hired Bomani Ruler to make a step file for Max Period.
And they didn't.
Don't start that rumor.
I know, I know.
That rumor's already going around.
I know, but you look at it, and it's just like, okay, let's speed up the fucking BPM to 800 BPM or whatever it is at the very end.
Wow.
Wow.
That's fun.
I think they've totally jumped the shark.
No, here's what they did.
They don't really know what we want.
That's why DDR Extreme was, what songs do you want?
Notice all the songs that they picked, a lot of them, were sim files beforehand.
So, think about it.
If I'm going to find out what people want as a sim file...
or not a sim file, but a steps for Max and what I want the song.
I'm going to go listen to all the sim files and mix songs.
Notice... Wait, wait, you're talking about Max 2 USA, not Extreme, right?
Because you're talking about like Heaven had like 50 sim files for it and then... No, no, no, no, no.
I'm talking about Extreme.
We're talking Extreme here.
Okay.
Okay, because look.
Colors, A, V, those all have steps.
I see what you're talking about.
Okay.
Now look at Max period.
It's basically...
I could basically make that stupid song, okay?
That song... It was very basic.
It wasn't remixed at all, very much.
And, um... Why do you need Komi in an original song?
Okay, and the step charts to it, it's a bunch of jumping.
It's just...
It was fucking retarded.
So, how are most of the Max step charts and songs?
They suck.
So, I guess they think that we like this kind of step charts, so that's what they gave us.
I really liked the steps for Max 300.
I think those were really good for the song.
Max Unlimited, pretty good.
Lots of jumps, but still pretty good.
And then it just started going downhill.
Legend of the Max, alright, but just, I don't know.
I think it should have ended there, just with Max 300 and Max Unlimited.
And the steps just start, you know...
I guess there's just only so much they can do with the steps before they run out of ideas.
It's interesting that you guys keep saying there's only so much they can do.
There's only so much they can do.
There's only so much they can do because I think they're done.
Because DDR Extreme has a credits mode on it, and in this credits mode...
It's very epilogue-ish in the way it's presented.
It kind of goes through the history of DDR.
Like it shows DDR first mix was then, and DDR second mix was then.
It shows little screenshots and stuff.
And then they're pretty much giving you the impression that that's it.
We're done.
No more DDR.
Although I don't think that's the case.
I think DDR is going to come back, but it's going to be a...
It's going to be different.
It's going to be different, like how Beatmania 2DX is different than Beatmania.
And to further reinforce that, they have, in each mix that's released, there's a master song list that includes all the songs that they're working on for other mixes that have not been released yet, and DDR Extreme has the same track list as DDR Max USA 2, which pretty much, it's just, all that's left on that song list is just the Ultra Mix, and that's it.
But obviously we know the European, I mean they're still developing for Europeans market, you know, and they're also developing for our market.
So, I mean I'm sure you'll see more stuff, it's just we'll only be in the US.
And we'll see, I mean once the stupid party collection comes out, there might be some more stuff on there, you never know.
So.
Yeah, that's true, because there's still the Party Edition coming out.
Party Collection, and you never know, it might be like preview for something.
Although, I seem to think that it's kind of weird that Party Collection is kind of coming out after DDR has kind of already had its epilogue here.
So I don't know what DDR Party Collection is going to be.
I'm hoping that maybe there'll be some kind of hint for the new DDR.
I wouldn't read too much into that cred screen, because they're just talking about what came out so far.
It's kind of like a thank you to them.
I'm...
I don't know about you guys.
Did you guys see the credit sequence at all, or did you guys kind of, even from Max Period, even just the Max Period, thank you for playing the way it claps at the end and it's like a finale type thing, more of like an encore kind of song.
Then again, that song sucked.
Yeah, it did suck.
I'll give you that, but you know.
The whole thing is it comes back down to what they put on that stupid header for Extreme.
We're starting over.
You don't start over if you're going to end it right there.
I mean, that's kind of retarded right there.
I mean, obviously they're going to do something with it.
They didn't say, this is the last one.
This is, you know, it ends here.
You know, the final revolution or something like that, you know.
They would definitely advertise it like that if it was the last one.
I don't think they're just going to be like, eh, whatever.
I mean, there's still plenty of stuff that they haven't even tried yet.
They haven't tried, like, doing songs with unlocks that have to do with the emall cards and stuff like that, and I'm sure there's a new machine coming.
It's just a new type of machine that they're still developing that's probably a little ways away.
Here's what's going to be interesting.
I'm very confident that we're going to see DDR Extreme in the U.S., a home version of DDR Extreme.
I'm very confident that we're going to have that.
It's going to be interesting to see if the U.S.
kind of treats it as the last mix or what they're going to do, because as far as I can tell, DDR in the U.S.
is still mega popular.
I mean, I was listening to Under Station Live on Friday night, the radio show that
I started on that's still on Live365 if you want to catch it.
I was listening to Under Station Live, and the host there works for one of those discount stores, one of those big discount stores, and they're getting, like, huge shipment of dance pads in now, which shows, like, you know, well, maybe it's that, oh, the dance pads aren't selling, so they're having to be relegated to discount stores, but that more shows to me that DDR is, like, everywhere.
You know what I mean?
It's still growing in the U.S., from what I see.
Just like always, in Japanese games that are produced, directed, and created in Japan, we always get them, you know, whatever the latest thing is in Japan, we get them either a few months to a year or years behind them.
And, you know, it's just starting to get, I mean, even though there were American machines three years ago, with the 1.5, you know,
It didn't still take off nearly as much as it's going to start with, these home versions, because people who don't have the... A lot of people out there see it as, oh, this is a good way to get an exercise, but they don't want to go up and make a fool of themselves on the American machines out there in the arcades, or some of the import machines.
Now they're like, okay, I can buy it and play it in my own home.
So it's starting to get popular.
People are starting to...
See, and I think, yeah, there is still a life for DDR, you know, a market for DDR in America, but I don't see there being much more of a market for music games in general.
In the next two years, I think we're going to find out where music games are going.
Ending, or...
Whether or not it's going to go much longer Because a lot of other companies are doing Namco has a line of music games They've got Taiko no Tatsujin You know, there's a lot of other companies out there that are doing Enix has been doing the Bust a Move series Even though that's pretty much done with Music games are going to die out very soon So it's not surprising that the latest versions of DDR are kind of just sucking I think they're just going to start I think they're going to start...
You can tell by where their money's going with games.
The big, big titles that come on me are putting out like this New Castlevania.
Obviously, they're taking their money away from their Bomani series, and they're putting it towards something else that people are going to... might last longer.
I don't know.
That's just my opinion.
I think you're wrong on one thing.
I don't think the music games are dying.
I think they're changing.
As the systems get bigger and better, I think the music games are changing too.
I think that's why we have this new line of games coming out.
We have the karaoke revolution.
They say karaoke is going to be the next big music game because you've got American Idol, the game as well, which isn't really karaoke.
It's more crap.
The thing I was thinking of, though, is look at DDR itself as an arcade machine.
It's running on hardware that's a good 10 years old.
That's true.
It's running on... Well, not about 10 years old, but it's pretty damn old.
Yeah, 98.
It's like a good 6 years old right now.
It's due for an update.
I mean, it's so old right now, they can't do anything else with this, so they can't release another game on there because it will just be inferior.
They can't possibly do it.
That's why they're coming up with a new hardware system for it.
It would make sense that they're shifting their money away from it right now, and they're kind of hurrying through some of these things, because maybe they're just trying new stuff right now with the hardware.
They're trying to...
I would love to see, to make DDR more interactive, love to see them bring out another, like a substream type mix, but have it a little more interactive, where...
You've got a newer version of Beatmania 2DX and a newer version of, or just whatever Beatmania machine they want to link to it, I would hope it'd be 2DX, with a DDR, a newer version of that, and let's say, you know, you play, somebody's playing 2DX, you don't have to have them linked, but if you want to have them linked, one person on 2DX will be playing the song, like DJing, so you've got more interaction, you've got like a person who's DJing and a person who's dancing.
Then, depending on how good the person playing 2DX, DJing, quote unquote, is doing, you
DarkSakura, Loki,
It changes the way the steps turn out in the end of the song.
So like if you miss a certain step, it goes ahead and makes the song a little easier near the end.
Whereas if you start doing really good, and you keep doing better and better, and you're hitting all the steps, the song kind of morphs and it upgrades.
It becomes a harder song with a different type of ending.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
One arcade in the whole nation would have it.
That's arcade infinity.
Not if they put in the effort to produce many of them and really advertise it.
It would be so expensive.
It would be so expensive.
I don't think any... The interesting thing about DDR is as expensive as it is, you can still find it at your local bowling alley.
Well, okay, I'm not thinking in the interest of us Americans.
I'm thinking of in the Japanese market because I'm not going to be one of those people who sits there and complains, why don't we get these cool Japanese games in America?
Because they're not made for us in America.
The American companies will want to bring them over when they think we're ready for them or if there is a market.
They're made in Japan for the Japanese market.
Now, on top of that, I'm thinking, for their interest, they have a lot of DDR machines and a lot of 2DX machines in Japan.
They could just have a hardware upgrade, including, like, a network adapter that could link these machines.
I mean, making new machines, of course, would be hell of expensive, but for them to just do... I mean, the hardware upgrade from 8th style to 9th style 2DX was a pretty big upgrade.
I mean, it's all hard drive, it's all computer now, running an OS of, I believe, Windows XP.
So they obviously can do it, and they can keep it somehow money, economic, a good economic decision.
I think it can be done.
I don't know.
I just think that, like I believe, because I heard a few years ago the rumor was that Konami's been getting some bad flack, you know, or some bad results with their music series because of all the other companies bringing out other music games.
I mean, that's... If you have to admit, after Max 2 came out, I think all the rest of their music games have just been like... It may just be me, but nobody I know except the hardcore players are interested in Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania anymore.
Yet the mixes keep coming out.
Yeah, that's right.
And poppin' music keeps coming out.
Nobody cares about... Like, Guitar Freaks is just...
I love the game, but you have to look past the fact that it's been beaten into the ground.
Yeah, well, you make a point, because people are going to get pissed off and say, hey, I love Guitar Freaks Drum Mania.
Get past the fact that you love the game and the idea of the game and look at the quality of the music on it.
The quality of the music has gone down since, like, 5th Mix, Drum Mania, at least that I can think of, because that was the first machine we got.
No, actually, no, we got 5th Mix, Guitar Freak, sorry.
You know, there were a lot of songs on there that I would play constantly.
I pretty much always had something fresh to play, but when I go and I try to play Guitar Freak's 8th Mix, I think we have, there's probably, like, five songs I'll play.
I mean, there are some good old songs that came, but I think I played them to death.
And then as far as the new songs is concerned, it's just like there's not very many good new songs.
So the series has kind of been... I was just in Milpitas Golf Land not too long ago.
I was there for Chubb's birthday party a couple weeks ago.
And they have Guitar Freaks.
It's either 9 or 10.
I don't know what it was.
But I walked by it at one point, and it was completely empty, and I had no interest in putting the dollar in and playing, even though I'd never even played it yet.
Yeah, I haven't played it, so I think I'd try it out, but still...
I played the Guitar Freaks 10, I think, or 9.
It was, yeah, it was 9.
I don't even know if it's 9 or 10.
10 just came out, I think.
10's just coming out.
So it was Guitar Freaks 9.
I played that at Phantom of Khan once, and I was like, eh.
After that, didn't even care.
Played it like maybe one or two times, and I was done.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Unlocked, you know, all three new songs, which was like, whoop-a-dee-doo, and then I was done.
I was done playing the game, I just didn't care no more.
Because, you know, I played the rest of these songs to death in the arcade.
I don't know, I will always like Drum Mania, because I personally, I love drum music.
www.darksakura.com
And even when we have Drum Mania, it's broken a lot, you know, constantly.
So, I can't speak for it.
If I go down to M. Milpitas and get to play their Drum Mania 8th mix, then maybe I'll like it.
I can't really speak for it right now.
I hate to put you on the spot, Bradley, but I'm curious, because I know you're a big fan of Guitar Freaks, because you're always asking me to play the music from it.
What do you think about this whole conversation?
Eh, well, I haven't played Ninth because I haven't been in the medias in like six months.
I still like it.
I actually haven't really heard the music from Ninth because I maybe listened to it once and haven't listened to it since.
So I can't really say anything about the quality, but I still enjoy it.
That's really all I can say at the moment.
I...
I have to say I am looking forward to Marmalade, Potpourri de Marmalade on, I think it's like Guitar Freaks 10.
Yeah, if they're not doing any more DDR, you would think all the artists that do the originals for DDR will now, you know, go to some other games and make some good originals for that.
I don't know, of course, I don't know what fucking game Soda could do.
Well, I guess he'll go to 2DX or something.
Although, you know, it's debatable if 2DX has as much life left as well.
So...
Who knows?
Who knows where all that's going?
Okay.
It's hard to make a prediction.
We'll just have to see.
Was there anything you saw in the chat room you want to comment on?
I know you saw some stuff earlier that made you go on.
It's a completely different topic.
It'd be kind of weird to change topics right now.
That's alright.
But I want to say something real quick.
In case your neighbors are listening now.
Are they really?
Well, your neighbors walked by and they were saying, so, do you still do the show?
And I said, yes.
And they asked, what is it called and how do they get to it?
And so I basically said, live 365, search for Orange Lounge and check it out because the page isn't updated really yet.
It needs to be updated, the web page.
Yeah, it does need an update.
He's funny, though.
Your neighbor said he could listen to it.
He's got broadband, so he could listen to it.
And then he could, like, I don't know,
respond to something you say in the chat room and then come running downstairs, knock on your door and go, hey, did you get that?
Yeah.
He could, theoretically with the buffer, one of them could run downstairs, yell something in the microphone, then run upstairs and hear themselves.
Oh, exactly, exactly.
With the buffer, they could hear themselves say it.
Because I think we've, I've done that in one way or another.
I don't remember what it was, but I remember like yelling something in it and then going off to hear it somewhere else.
I think it was when we were doing a remote broadcast for one of the tournaments or something.
That's great.
Well, come say hello if you're listening.
Yeah, if neighbors are listening.
Hi, neighbors.
Sorry, I forget your name.
That's my test.
I want to see if they're listening.
Come downstairs and say something to me on the show.
I'm afraid they would have turned it off a long time ago.
They probably got bored.
This is so boring.
The Guitar Freaks chat probably put them to sleep.
Alright, well let's wake everybody up with some... Oh no, you wanted to respond to some comments in the chatroom, you wanted to take a topic shift.
Why don't we go to break, and then we'll come back and you can do the other topic, and then we'll do the cage match, because we need to get to tonight's cage match as well.
Okay, we'll do that.
We are... Oh, you see that in the chatroom right now?
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, hey, hello!
There you go.
I was wondering who the new people in the chat room were.
There you go, you never know who the new people are.
Okay, we'll be back after this break.
We're going to play Jamie's, she's out tonight because she's sick, but she wanted to hear some Liar Liar from Guitar Freaks 4th, all that talk about Guitar Freaks.
So here it is.
Enjoy.
and the rest of the band.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
We have got the bomb!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Thanks for watching!
Orange Lounge Radio.
We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
Hello, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
You know what?
That's funny, because during the break, the neighbors came downstairs, so they were listening.
What do you know?
So, we have to refrain from talking about how much Folsom sucks right now.
Yeah, let's keep the language down to a minimum.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I'm not going to be talking about condoning any kind of illegal activity, except I'm just going to say there's some skepticism about mod chips for next generation systems.
I'm speaking specifically of Sucksbox, Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube.
I don't know anything about Xbox.
I don't care to.
I don't like Xbox.
I'm not going to talk on that.
GameCube, there's no current way to copy games.
So there is no reason... Although Matt thinks he heard something today.
Matt, what's that, Matt?
I read something today.
I downloaded this off of supernova.org, your wonderful BitTorrent site.
Anyways, it is... And let me pull this up real quick here.
Okay, it's a... I bought... It's a GameCube pack is what I got.
It's a bunch of different files.
One of the files on there is called...
PSUL 1.1 GameCube Code Uploader
Using your network adapter.
So basically the way it works is you have to have a copy of Phantasy Star Online, a broadband adapter, a PC to GameCube cable basically, just a network cable from your... A patch cable.
An Ethernet card, of course.
So basically you're just making a network connection from your GameCube to your PC.
And you just...
and you have to set up your computer on a certain IP so it can communicate with it and you set up your IP in your Phantasy Star Online thing and you basically
Make a connection with Phantasy Star Online
Very glitchy.
Games they've gotten to work on it are Luigi's Mansion works fine.
What was the other one?
I think it was Animal Crossing they can get to work also.
This just means we're this much closer to finally figuring out a way to back up, quote unquote, your games for GameCube.
Well, they actually have a program that supposedly does that, too.
It's not really been taped.
Well, I've heard, because, Mike, I have a cousin who's, you know, been renamed Nameless, or remained Nameless, if, anyway, who apparently is, like, he's on the top always with all the, um...
The backing up of games for all systems.
And he told me a couple months ago that apparently there was no way to do it yet for GameCube.
But, hey, in the next couple months they may have found something out.
It's just really funny because I love watching how companies come out and say their system is so secure.
It's foolproof.
And those are the companies that are the easiest to crack.
Well, Nintendo's never really had a really good way to block...
Piracy.
Supposedly, you know what's also weird?
Supposedly, I don't know if the GameCube is backwards compatible, but supposedly I read on one of the posts that Nintendo 64 ROM images work on there, too.
It's possible.
What are you talking about?
Nintendo's always had one of the best ways to block piracy.
They have cartridges.
You can't copy a cartridge very easily.
You can, but it's not easy.
It's not as easy as putting in a PlayStation disc, click, copy, done.
Okay, here's the thing, though.
and having a modded PSX.
It's similar.
It's easy in ways and not as easy in other ways.
For the N64, my cousin had this thing called the V-Doctor.
It was a pretty pricey drive.
It was a CD-ROM drive you stuck underneath the N64 and it hooked up to it through this little serial cable thing that was on the N64.
You hooked that into your hard drive.
And what you would do, or to your computer, or what you could, the reason why I had a CD-ROM drive is because you could either burn a CD full of ROM images from N64 games, and then put it in this little V-Doctor thing, this drive, and it would play the games on your N64.
You just had to have this other little cartridge, it was like a blank...
Ram cartridge that you would plug into your N64.
So, I mean, he had every freaking American and Japanese N64 game out.
And even stuff that hadn't come out yet, when I went over to his place, I was like, wow, how'd you do this?
I mean, he was doing it.
He was pirating it.
And even Super Nintendo, there were, you know, obviously there's ROM images and there's emulation.
It was funny.
Actually, I saw an auction for it.
It was an arcade game.
I don't know what game they would use this in, but it was an arcade memory card reader for a Nintendo 64.
It sold for, I believe, 99 cents.
NFL Blitz, I think, is the game that uses it.
Because Roseville Golf Line has one.
I've seen the Nintendo 64 memory card thing.
Nobody uses that on here.
Nobody uses it.
Anyhow, and my point was how it's easier in some ways is because you didn't have to mod any of the Nintendo systems.
Whereas, like with Sony's, you have to get inside, void your warranty, solder here, solder there with this little chip you buy, and then possibly mess up your system, which I have done once out of like the 30 PlayStation systems I've modded.
If I remember correctly, I think the Xbox, you don't actually have to... Supposedly, yeah.
There's a software mod, I think.
There's some software.
Which is not surprising, because you look at all the flaws in Microsoft software, so hey.
Okay, well you want to get back to the original topic.
You want to talk about next-gen modding, which you have advised me against in the past.
In the past, in the past.
And I've always said, every time I brought this up in the past, like when PS2 first came out, because this is the current subject now, PS2.
In the past I said, it's not worth your time to buy a mod chip for PS2.
And when I said in the past, I mean like when it came out.
because they would come out with new games that would have mod detection, that would have, you know, mod chip detection, that would basically lock out the game so you couldn't play it, or specifically, mostly that's going on for a lot of the online titles, which there isn't really many for PS2 anyway.
Not right now.
You know, there were ways... Final Fantasy XI, just around the corner.
Exactly.
There was, you know, ways that they could combat it.
My cousin bought, a year ago, a mod chip for his PS2.
and it's not as like, you know, new-y, fan-dangled and, you know, great as the newer ones out.
But it has not given him a problem since.
He's been able to back up every game that's come out since and play it fine.
That's a year ago.
So Sony has not been, you know, and what I always had said was that, you know, wait till PS2 starts to die out, you know.
I mean, they're still making games for it, but it's not too far off that we're going to hear of the PS3 or whatever their new system's going to be.
and Loki says already is.
I haven't been keeping me up.
I say once it hits $99, which is pretty soon, that's when everybody had a modded PlayStation.
Exactly.
That's when everybody's going to have a modded PlayStation 2.
Except me, I have no reason for one.
I honestly have no reason to get a modded PlayStation.
Here's my point, though.
There's a newer mod chip called the DMS3.
I think you can go to DMS3.com.
It'll bring it up.
This mod chip, it's just as difficult to mod your PlayStation 2 as it is with any of the other PS2 mod chips, but this one has flash memory on it.
And it has two BIOS flashes on it, and you can get updates, which you burn onto CDs,
from their site that flash it to the newest BIOS.
So say a new game comes out and it detects the mod chip.
You go to their newest site.
They are on top of it.
You download their little BIOS flash.
You burn it in a CD, put it in your PS2.
There you go, you can play the game now.
Also, because of that, there's all these other new features on the DMS3 where you can, when you're loading your PS2, you hold a button down, it sets it to turn off mod chip.
So if you want to play online games, like say you actually bought a real copy of Final Fantasy XI, and it's locking you out of their online server because you have a mod chip, you hold the button down, it disables your mod chip, now you can play online.
This new DMS3 mod chip is the one to get, I'm telling you.
It's time you could mod your freaking PS2s.
I don't want people going out there saying that it's worthless, because you can do it now.
I mean, it's just... But there may not be a reason to do it.
For some people, there's no reason.
For me, there's no reason.
There is nothing left I want to play on PS2.
Nothing.
Well, for me, I think all... And I have a Japanese... Everything I want to play is Japanese, anyway.
Now, technically, with a mod chip, I can play the Japanese games, but...
There's just not that many.
There's not enough.
Okay, your point is taken.
But there's some of us untrustworthy people out there who want to play our other games.
Pictures of our games.
You tell me how to mod my GameCube, I'm on it.
Because I play my GameCube more than anything else.
I don't think you're ever going to need to mod your GameCube.
Eventually there's going to be a way around it, like Loki just said.
Exactly.
There's always going to be a way around it.
You know what?
This is what they all say.
When PS3 comes out, it's going to be online.
You're going to download your games online.
Everything's going to be online.
You're not going to be able to mod this shit anymore.
Never going to happen.
Why do you say that, LB?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, what about something like iTunes, which is the way you can download music online, and they've sold, what, 10 million songs today.
It's the most successful online one.
True, it's not nearly as big as going into the store and buying things, but for those people that prefer to buy their things online, they have a pretty viable option, and it's somewhat successful.
For people who are talking, I think Baka is saying, was it DMS3 or DMX?
It's DMS3.
Go to DMS3.com, you can find out about it.
But the thing is, though, is I don't like not buy a game because I only like a portion of the game.
See, now with CDs, I may only like one song, so I'm only going to buy that one song.
If the only way I can buy that song is online, then yeah, I'm going to go ahead and do that because there might not be a single for that.
In my case, I don't buy music because it's too damn expensive and the artists mostly suck.
If I want to discover new music, I'm going to go about it the illegal way and download it for free.
Or, I'm going to go listen to those independent artists that don't get any coverage and those normally end up being better than the most mainstream artists anyways.
So, why should I spend money and pay for your product when it stinks?
When it...
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, yeah.
Oh, the big bad R.I.A.
is going to track us down.
Whatever.
You know, I don't listen to a lot of music in the first place.
Most of the music I listen to is just Bomani stuff.
Homemade remixes.
I don't listen to a lot of mainstream stuff.
I was hoping to save the iTunes topic for Vanilla Sky tomorrow night, but whatever.
That's fine.
On topic of mainstream stuff, real quick.
Okay.
Okay.
and DarkSakura.
Thank you for watching!
To some extent, I believe in supporting the artist for a song I really, really like.
And the songs I downloaded, I really, really like.
And B, because when I try to find these songs on FileShare, I get shit copies.
Every time I get lousy volume, I get just cut things.
And you know what?
It is just worth the goddamn dollar to just get a perfect quality song the first time.
The end.
That's me.
But we'll talk more about iTunes tomorrow.
I'm sorry, so you wanted to say... Oh, what I was going to say is that people who will probably go, oh no, piracy would be where it is now, even if they did do it.
It may have gotten to the point eventually, but not as quickly, because I believe that once you put a... What do you call it?
What am I looking for?
You put like a rule or a... God, obstacle.
You put an obstacle in the way of somebody, and they want to overcome it, they will, and they'll find a way to overcome it.
You put...
Thanks for watching!
I think you made, that's a good point.
I mean, if they had put it up, they wouldn't be having as much problems right now with what they've announced.
But they didn't.
End of story.
RAA did not act fast enough, which is why the MPAA is trying so hard right now with the movies thing.
They're trying to get all these movie services up and going, and although Loki's right, there's not that many people that really want to watch movies online.
Yeah, you want to go in.
They're trying.
Movies is a thing that will never...
Thanks for watching!
You are changing experience.
Because now not only do I have to go buy a game system that's fucking expensive when it comes out because they have all these new features.
Now I have to buy a membership online.
Now I have to buy cable internet where I might not have it.
No, because it's not going to work on dial-up.
Oh, but if I do have dial-up, it's going to take four goddamn years to download the goddamn game.
And what if there's a disconnection on, you know, what if my cable goes out or something?
There goes my game.
I don't have my game stored on my hard drive because that crashes too.
It's just...
Too much stuff.
You're going to have a game.
How are they going to rent product then out at the stores?
The rental businesses for games are going to go out because it's all online supposedly.
But the MPAA would not care.
They would love to see that happen.
The MPAA would care because people like to rent movies.
They don't like to buy movies.
Okay?
Because renting a movie costs $5.
You see it once, you're done.
Instead of investing, you know, that money and watching that movie and having it at home, like I have tons of movies I buy and don't watch, it's just stupid.
But if they could be in control of the movie renting and not Blockbuster, that's capitalism.
See, like I said, the movie renting and movie business will not change completely.
Like, it won't go completely online.
Because regardless of whether people want to buy or rent or whatever...
People still want to see movies on the big screen and if they want to rent then they'll go to the movie rental places and rent them.
Those won't go out of business.
Maybe renting video games will go, but the fact is that they're obviously not going to implement or try to implement something like that until every internet connection in America is broadband.
Until it's standard to get broadband and extremely cost efficient.
The only way it'll ever be like that is when broadband becomes as common as electricity.
Exactly.
Which is something that they've talked about in the last, like, five years ago.
There was a thing called...
I can't remember, I used to have the website for it, but they were basically saying that they could get speeds of like fiber optic speed, you know how fast fiber optic networks go, that kind of speed from your electrical outlet.
They could do this thing where they could make the, they take the digital signal from wherever the server is, they convert it to analog, and they put it in I think a really, really low frequency, just kind of like how DSL is, and they run it through the power lines.
And it goes at like fiber optic speeds.
And they just have to install these, they have to build these up, these like switching boxes in cities in certain areas because there's only so much, there's a signal degradation that happens, you know.
And so that was like five years ago and they said they were still working on it and they want it.
But basically that kind of idea makes you wonder, you know, in the near future, in like the next ten years, we could see where you plug in your appliance, your computer, to the wall and it's got an internet connection.
They talk about fridges with internet connection and all this crazy stuff.
Yeah, they talk about that on the same page.
They said something about how, like, what if your toaster was plugged in.
I don't want my toaster being plugged in the internet, obviously.
I don't want freaking, like, advertisements burning onto my toast.
My toaster comes up and it's got an Apple logo on it.
I can see it writing in your journal, today kind of sucked.
A hacker broke into my toaster today and started burning my bread.
Exactly.
See, I don't want that kind of thing.
All right.
I just want to bring up a point from the chat room real fast.
John Fields makes a pretty good point.
He says, All I have to say, if the MPAA had control of renting, unfair monopoly that the government would thus force Blockbuster to take over again.
So he's suggesting that the MPAA did have control of all of this stuff.
Thank you for watching!
to do this all online, and they will fight this to the death.
You have to understand, most of the people that you talk to out there, I mean, because we have our exposure with our friends who are all connected to the internet, all wired individuals.
But your average Joe doesn't know jack about computers, won't touch it because they act like it's the devil.
My father.
They don't get it, and if they switch it all to online, they're never going to get it.
Yeah, but you know what?
Those people are dying.
And in about 20 years...
It's not going to... Everybody on the earth will know how to use a computer.
Well, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't say that.
Because America's... Everybody in America, in the industrialized nations, will know how to use a computer.
I retract my statement because there's countries that aren't going to still be on computers.
Here's proof.
In the 80s, in the late 70s, like when arcade games and stuff were coming out, like, you know, late, the 70s, and I think actually, I don't remember, my timelines are bad.
Anyway, people who played arcade games, you know, probably usually a lot of them were kind of older, they were like in their late teens, 20s and stuff.
Video game consoles started coming out, and with the newer generations, kids started playing at younger ages, 8 or 9, you know, with Nintendo.
My friend's brother...
I just wanna make a quick plug.
On Vanilla Sky tomorrow night, we're gonna bring up an article
where they talk about these young kids and they're going to make these young kids play games that we played when we were young kids.
Just wait to hear what they have to say.
You are going to feel so old tomorrow night.
7 o'clock, Vanilla Sky.
I love that idea.
I don't understand.
The characters don't talk to you.
Like, vocally.
So, which block am I?
Ew, it's... What is this?
This little blocky thing?
Why does that... It's like mustard.
It's attacking me.
Is there anything else you want to say about mod chips, Brad?
We've kind of got off on all these tangents tonight.
You know, for being... Half of us being sick, we sure have a lot to say tonight.
It's like we're just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah-ing from one topic to another.
But that's alright.
I kind of like it, so...
There may not be any organization involved today.
That's alright, that's alright.
That's the sickness.
That's the sickness, this extreme inorganization.
Is there anything else you want to say about Monchips?
I didn't jump to the cage match.
There will always be a way.
People who are out there saying, no, it's worthless.
No, there will always be a way.
Alright.
Okay, if you'd like to comment on any of that, head on over to our chatroom, www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat.
And join in our chatroom.
And, by the way, being in our chatroom is the only way that you can participate in tonight's one and only Cage Match.
Yes, the Orange Lounge Cage Match is where we're going to play three songs back-to-back, one picked by me, one picked by DarkSakura, even though she's not here, she submitted her vote online to me, and one picked by Loki.
and you can vote for one of those three songs.
The winner goes into musical rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio, so you, the chatroom, have the power to decide which song will be played all week.
We start off with last week's winner, which was a song brought to us by Loki, and since it was last week's winner, we're only going to hear a clip of it.
The song is P8107, and it's a remix of Paranoia by...
Onoken.
Thank you, Onoken.
So here it is.
This is a clip because it was last week's winner.
You'll get to hear a little bit of it.
Song number one tonight, last week's winner, P8107.
Here we go.
Alright, that's song number one for tonight.
That's P8107 by Ono Ken.
Song number two tonight is my pick, and you get to hear the whole thing because it's a new song.
I was on the internet not too long ago just downloading a bunch of remixes by Above and Beyond because I fucking love them, they're great.
And so I wanted to get as many remixes by them as I could, and this is one of the ones I got.
This is an artist called Ministry of Sound, and the song is Far From In Love, and it's the Above and Beyond mix.
Enjoy.
Song number two tonight that you can vote for in the cage match.
I can see behind your eyes that you're afraid of who you are All this silence now between us, I'm amazed we've come this far, far from it
Like a fire burn to memory, I know this is where it ends
Thank you for watching!
Alright, that was, I'm being corrected on the artist, sorry guys, that was actually Above and Beyond themselves doing that song, even better in my opinion, Far From In Love is the song, and if you're curious about that edit, it is from the CD Transnation 2003, which is an import, by the way.
Let's go around the room and see what people thought of that, start off with Loki.
It's pretty cool, I liked it.
This is Above and Beyond, so I can't go wrong with it.
Now if it was Above and Beyond remixed by Paul Oakenpole, yeah, that would have been cool.
But yeah, I give it an 8.
Jamie's submitted her vote via the internet since she's out sick today.
If you guys are just joining us, Jamie's out sick today.
She says, Rob, your song gets a 7.8 for being transalicious.
No wait, I give it an 8.
She's decided to be nice and round up.
Wasn't that kind?
My thoughts.
God, it's great.
And DarkTips3 said in the chatroom, it sounds like a total DDR song.
You're right.
Yeah, it's cool.
I like it.
And it gets a 9 for me, because Above and Beyond is like the shit.
I love them.
So, there you go.
Bradley.
Kind of pretty cool.
Give it an 8.5.
Brad.
Oh, you don't have a mic?
I thought you had a mic over there.
I wasn't listening to it.
Sorry.
Loki was showing me this cool, uh... I don't know if Ken's beaten any SVX files on his simulator, so... Sorry, I didn't hear it.
You didn't... You didn't hear any of it at all?
You were standing right there!
This was Loki's pick, or whose?
Yours?
I'm gonna give it a one.
What the hell?
Alright.
That was, uh, song number two, Above and Beyond, Far From Unloved.
Here is... What?
We're doing what again?
Oh, I thought the show was fucking up.
Alright, song number three is Jamie's pick.
She sends this along.
Even though she can't be here, she wants you all to hear it and hope that it'll win tonight's cage match.
Here it is.
I listened to this song before the show a little bit.
It's pretty good.
It's an Avex song.
You guys know Avex.
2DX licenses a lot of tracks from them.
Getting mic switched on me, okay.
The song is called Ways of Love, and the artist is CyberX featuring Jody Watley.
And it's from an album called CyberX, so give this a try.
If you like Avex tracks, you just might like this.
This is Jamie's pick tonight.
CyberX featuring Jody Watley with Waves.
Feel the waves of love Messages we send Feel the waves of love There's a new horizon With the rising sun We can reach the heavens On the waves of love The waves of love
Thank you for watching!
All right.
CyberX featuring Jody Watley with Waves of Love.
Loki, what'd you think?
I thought it was pretty cool.
I'm upbeat this week.
See, I don't have anything negative to say about those songs.
I give it an 8.
I liked it in the beginning, but it just kind of, I don't know, kind of dragged for me towards the end, but I do typically like most Avex tracks, so I'll be nice and give it seven and a half.
The trance song is supposed to sound the same for like seven minutes.
It's different.
I can't explain it, but it's different.
Just go with it, okay?
Jamie sends her vote online, and she says, of course, her song gets a ten for being exciting trance.
Bradley, or Brad, whoever gets the mic first.
Dumbass, dude!
Okay, hold on, I gotta tell you if you're on camera yet.
Uh, got it!
It was okay.
I wasn't going away, so give it a 7.
There's a nice picture of Brad's ass sticking up in the air.
Wait, hold on.
Look at the webcam, people.
Okay, anyway.
Brad!
Um...
I've said before to other people I don't really like trance songs unless it's a Kiriyama Oka, so I'm giving it a 5.
Ooh.
You're mean.
I'm not trying to be mean.
I really, just trance can't really be interesting unless it's a Kiriyama Oka.
Alright, alright.
You're entitled to your opinion, even if it sucks.
Alright.
Here we go.
Here's a recap.
You can send your votes in very soon, but you have to be in the chat room.
And you know what?
Now is a great night to be in our chat room because it's crowded in there.
There's lots of people in there tonight.
Now, why aren't all of you on the stream?
Because I know that there's more people in the chat room than are on the stream.
So shame on you.
Shame on you.

Click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.
All right.
Meet some new people, and we want to meet you.
We want to meet new people tonight.
Okay, keep the microphone over there, Brad.
Here you go, you can vote for one of these three songs.
Last week's winner, P1... Hey, shut up.
Here's a recap.
First song you can vote for, P8107.
Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight, Above and Beyond with Far From In Love.
Alright, and song number three you can vote for tonight is CyberX featuring Jody Watley with Waves of Love.
Alright, there you go.
Place vote now!
Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your vote.
If you don't know how to do that, just ask somebody and they'll tell you how you send a private message to Sky.
Votes made public in the chatroom don't count!
Alright.
So...
Back to the show while we tally up those votes for cage matches as they come in.
Loki, tell us about this other project you've kind of been working on lately.
You're working on it now.
You've been working on it for a little while.
What's up with this?
You're kind of taking Step Mania modification to the extreme from what I see, no pun intended.
Well, I'm just right now, because no one can see this out there in radio land.
I'm making a new banner.
I've been trying to pitch an idea to Keith at Golfland because I've seen it done before where basically you wire a Stepmania PC to a DDR machine and run Stepmania on there.
Well, Stepmania is meant to run as an arcade machine itself because it's got options for credits and all that stuff, so...
Obviously, that's what I'm doing here in-house with cabinets being built, but I thought, you know, why not do that in an arcade, too?
So, I've been basically looking into licensing rights and what it would cost, you know, because obviously I'm not going to ask Konami for permission, because, no, they're never going to say yes, so we're doing it anyways.
But I've been looking into, like, if, you know, a music artist or something was to come after me, how...
you know, what actual licensing rights we would need, so I checked into it, basically a set mini-based game could be considered a jukebox because it's just, you know, music being played and so it would fall under jukebox license rights, I think I don't know, it's a gray area but it only costs $364 a year to actually legally license it, but if we did all, like, Konami original stuff and just, basically it's going to be, you know, I want to
and so on.
That's what I'm gonna do, and right now I'm making a banner for Dance Dance Revolution EX2.
That's what I've got right now.
What the hell are you doing?!
You fucking idiot!
Brad making stupid gestures into the camera.
But, yeah, it's going along pretty good.
Um, the banner looks pretty, you know, official, except it's kind of... Looks like it's kind of squashed vertically, I have to fix that.
But, um...
Thank you for watching!
Right now, the feasibility is probably not going to... It's not going to happen there.
But this is just for my own, you know, machine.
Pretty much... Because if you think about it, I could probably make a better mix than Konami can, so... Why not give it a chance?
And I pose the option to them.
I'm like, look at it.
Pass the initial investment of buying the actual PC, which would pay for itself pretty quickly since DDR machines make a ton of money.
You'd have free upgrades for life on that damn thing, so...
Software upgrades would be easy, but, you know, whatever.
So that's what I've been doing on there.
So you think you're going to get away with it?
I mean, I realize that you're saying in the end it's probably not going to make it, but let's say it does make it somehow, or you buy an arcade, you win a lottery, buy an arcade, and put this machine in it, you think you'll make it?
Well, yeah, they're really the only people that could rain on my parade, if that were to ever happen, would be the people that play the game itself religiously, because they're like, oh, oh my god, you know, that's not an official Konami game, that's a poop bag, you're running out of sim.
But they're looking past, you know, what it actually is, and not just playing it for what it's supposed to be, which is just a game, you know, and if Konami's going to stop making arcade games, you know, the US isn't making arcade games for DDR,
and all these games are getting stagnant in arcades, people are going to go one of two routes.
They're either going to spend $1,500 to buy some hacked bootleg, which is looking like shit, or they're going to run software like this that you can emulate, you know, pretty much, you know, emulate DDR perfectly and have, you know, new features added to it that aren't seen in any of the games.
Plus, you know, you're...
DarkSakura.com
And we're talking like full unlocks here.
400 songs at least on this mix.
I mean, if you put like tons and tons and tons of unlocks on there, people will be playing this game forever.
I mean, it won't ever, you know, get boring.
If people get bored of a song, put a new song on there.
I don't see what the big deal would be if, I mean, other than, you know, well, Konami not getting credit for it or, you know, if they stop making DDR and you can't buy them anymore, then I guess that would, you know,
Fallen, the main of Abandonware, and, you know, I don't know.
I just, I think, unless, you know, people made it, like, a real big deal about it, you know, and it's not like I'm selling it, you know, we're just, it's a one arcade exclusive thing.
I don't see what the big deal would be.
But, um, we should have never invited him over.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I want to talk about DDRXbox for a minute, because there was some news this week about DDRXbox, and that is that it's gone gold.
No, it's not sold a certain amount of copies, but it's finished.
It's in the can, it's done, and it's going to be out November 18th.
It's kind of interesting, not a lot of knowledge about DDRXbox right now when it comes to songs.
We know that there's going to be a remix of Absolute in it, we know that it has shiny disco balls in it, the quickening...
Castles in the Sky, Mad Blast, I think was another one.
Is that what it's called?
The Dance Maniacs song, Mad Blast?
Mind Parasite.
What's Mad Blast?
What am I thinking of?
Oh, I'm thinking of the Car Freaks.
Ah, okay.
Alright.
Okay, but there's just not a lot to really talk about right now because they haven't been releasing a whole lot of information really.
They've all been just kind of working on it.
The anticipation from what I feel is not quite as big as it is for a typical PlayStation release.
I don't know if people are just scared because it's different or whatever, or maybe just because the marketing hasn't kicked in yet, but I don't know.
There just doesn't seem to be a lot of excitement about it.
I just...
Wouldn't it be interesting if this did well, that maybe Konami of Hawaii were to put together some new arcade release with their brand new interface they've done and their more competitive DDR-ness they have in there and all that stuff?
Do you have something to add to this conversation?
That's how I said Merry Christmas in Hawaiian.
Something like that.
Would you fucking talk about something worthwhile, Rob?
Wait, you don't think Xbox is worthwhile?
No.
Why not?
Xbox.
You know what, though?
There's a lot of folks that, you know... Yeah, those are the same people who... play sports games, like football, outside, where there's bears.
All right.
Um...
The only other songs we know, other than those we just mentioned, Colors by DJ Taka from Xtreme is going to show up.
And Sugaru, Revenge vs. Desire.
And then there were a few more from some list I saw, but I don't remember it.
So that's that.
We have not had an official song list come out from Konami.
That's the point.
But now that the game's gone gold, maybe they'll send some kind of... I don't know.
They'll do something.
Mecha Lecha Hi, Mecha Heidi Ho Alright, let's get to tonight's cage match winner Mecha Lecha Hi, Mecha Johnny Ho Tonight's cage match winner, ladies and gentlemen, is It's a tie
What?
It's a tie.
Between who?
So who wins?
So this is how we do it.
Because the one song that didn't tie.
This is the interesting thing.
It's a tie by one vote.
If one person had voted for the other song, it would have been a three-way tie.
So it was very close tonight.
Ooh, a three-way.
I know, ooh, a three-way.
So, here we go.
The two songs that tied tonight were last week's winner, P8107.
And the second song that tied tonight was Above and Beyond with Far From the Love.
And CyberX and Jody Watley was one vote away.
So, that means DarkSakura gets to pick who wins?
That's right, because the rules say the host whose song didn't win gets to break the tie.
But she's not here, what do we do?
Well, but she is here in spirit, she's in the chat room, so I'm going to ask her to send her vote along.
So we'll find out who won the cage match after the break.
I'm going to give her the break to deliberate and send her vote if she wants.
Oh, never mind, she's already sent it, so let's see.
And the winner is...
Jamie has voted for Far From In Love.
So that is the winner for tonight.
in a very, very close, probably the closest cage match yet.
I demand a re- Yeah, we're going to have a re-call now.
A re-count.
It's all your chads, people.
Make sure you puncture.
Loki's song already won two weeks in a row.
It was time for it to go.
Whatever, dude.
He wants to do a new song next week anyway, and she says, eat trance.
When she voted for it, she said, eat trance.
I'm not laughing.
All right.
There you go.
That's tonight's Winter of the Cage match and goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lock Radio.
We're going to do a break now.
You'd like to fuck my recount, wouldn't you?
When we come back from this little break of music, we're going to do the FUs of the week.
So send those over private message to me.
Hi, I'm Sky and I'm in the chat room and I'm just waiting to hear your FUs because we're going to read them very soon.
In the meantime...
Let's do a break of music.
Start it off with a little bit of Xenon.
Xenon
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura
DarkSakura DarkSakura
Thank you for watching!
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge Bay Money Music and More show?
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
It's unearthly.
It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 65 in progress.
And Dark Sakura's out sick tonight, unfortunately.
We wish her she gets better soon.
Orange Lounge Radio, music you hump to Thank you Also, Loki and I are sick, but somehow we're continuing to go on I think Loki's not quite as bad off as either Jamie or myself And I'm probably not as bad off as Jamie I talked to her on the phone earlier, she sounded pretty bad So, I'm somehow faking my way through this show tonight Joining me tonight, LankyStyle, over there, hello Baka's complaining there's nothing in the webcam, so I have to go back to my crazy antics No, no, Baka, shut up And Arcadian42's here too
Yo.
Yo.
And it's got, basically, it looks exactly like DDR Extreme, except it's blue in the background.
And I say blue in the background, you know where there'd be green checkers?
Now it's just solid blue.
Which is lame.
But that's what it is, and then the, it's like they didn't really know what they were doing when they made it.
And, I don't know, it's just, it's pretty lame.
And according to this, there's not really any new songs, it looks like, I don't know.
Alright, as promised, now it's time to get into the FUs of the week.
And we're going to start off with Jamie's FUs, even though she's not here, we do have her FUs, so let's start.
Here is justice.
Here is justice.
F you to stupid people on Ragnarok Online.
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
She has real F yous.
Here they are.
DarkSakura would like to say F you to being sick and that I can't take off work because of my impending trip to Alabama.
F you number two is missing the show.
F you number three is not having toilet paper.
That must be an interesting house right now.
Yeah, we've got plenty.
Jamie, you should have come over.
We've got plenty.
We bought like 50 gazillion packs in one at Ralph's.
FU number four, my nose is rubbed raw.
FU number five, not having good food at home.
FU to being hot.
FU to people who don't pay enough attention to the world around them.
F you to selfish frivolity, I'm guilty of the same, and not being able to save money.
F you to bad grammar and spelling, and lastly, F you number 10 from DarkSakura, F you to idiots.
Zelda, more like Zelda.
Shut up.
Alright, Loki's turn, your F yous.
F you to Sacramento, because I don't like you at all.
In fact, I really, really, really, really, really hate downtown Sac, because every time I drive down there, I get lost.
Because all their streets go one way, and it sucks.
And they don't label their streets, and they have them all messed up.
It just sucks.
And I can't find food down there.
I hate downtown Sac.
And they're making me drive down there.
And it sucks.
F you to Fox News Because, actually F you to any 24 hour news channel Because you covered the same story 50,000 times You know why?
Because actual news doesn't happen Or actual interesting news doesn't happen all the time So why do they even have 24 hour news networks in the first place?
Since you're just covering the same shit over and over and over again Why not just cover it once?
at the normal news time like ordinary news works.
So basically, point for our news networks are useless.
Um, FUG4 because they're just lame.
FUG Brad because he's an idiot.
And, um, also, um, that's so distracting.
Stop jumping!
God damn it.
F you to my cold, because now not only am I sick, but I have to go to jury duty, and that still sucks.
F you to jury duty, because I really don't like it.
And, you know, I honestly, I don't like people that much, so I didn't really want to be there in the first place.
And people waiting out in front of jury duty always have something stupid to say.
Like, I have to listen to this woman talk about how the water treatment plant works.
Like, I really care.
I just don't.
It's just like, he keeps blabbing on about it over and over, and there's some guy that works with B, and just, ugh, can't wait for the B over with.
And finally, put the damn coin door down!
That's way across the line, buddy.
Oh, no.
No, I was more... If we'd done the FUs on Wednesday, it would have been so much better, because I came in just angry as hell.
I have that bit taped, so I can play it later in the future if you want.
Sweet.
No, but I'm just like... It sucks because now I'm not angsty on the weekends.
I just kind of relax by the time Sunday comes around, you know?
So I was angry at first.
Like, I was totally pissed off about the whole, like,
Um, jury duty thing, but now I'm just kind of like calm, you know, I'm ready for it tomorrow, because it's not that bad.
But, I don't know what the hell he's doing.
F you to the fact that they didn't get to go out to go all-flanks, they really wanted to, and, you know, circumstances prevented that, so, oh well.
I'm done.
My turn.
Um, my biggest F you this week, obviously, is being sick, because when you're sick, you don't feel like doing shit.
F you to my friend who went out to the bar with me, Ice Princess F you to Ice Princess for being a drunken fucker on Friday night and he was being the biggest bitch ever and he was an hour and a half late to the club and no I'm not going to get over it because you suck you made me wait at the bar for an hour and a half for you and ugly old people were hitting on me and therefore you should be punished and I'm going to berate you to this forever and F you for getting drunk and
Grabbing my ass, you faggot.
Alright, let's move on, that's it.
Uh, Bradley, do you have a mic over there?
Brad or Bradley, somebody.
Bradley's trying to get a mic.
Uh... Fuck you to... Dial-up?
Fuck you.
The Bad Room is back with a pH 4.
Oh, fuck you too.
Not having any money.
Hello, very well.
I'm looking to sell stuff, but actually that's part of the good thing to sell stuff because I got too much crap as it is.
I don't have to look at or use.
So I'm going to get rid of some of this.
Uh, fuck you to truck drivers.
Think they own the road.
Get up behind you.
Thanks, that's the old
can drive faster up through the person in front of you if they just ride your ass and find things behind you, find keys behind you.
Uh, let's see, what else?
Anything else?
Uh, fuck you, they don't have any chips to eat.
I forgot to buy them, and fuck you for getting to buy apple juice.
So I can have something to drink in the morning other than water.
Or something that's hot.
Whatever.
All right, let's move on to Brad.
What's your FUs for today, Brad?
None?
Okay, the usual.
FU to the FU segment.
I don't like it.
All right.
Let's move on to the chatroom FUs then, shall we?
A random fuck you.
Oh, do you?
Okay.
Just fuck you to Stouffer's meals, because they suck.
Even though I haven't had one in a long time.
Stouffer's, like, TV dinner type things, they suck.
Especially compared to, like, Mary Colander's, which is... They're on sale, like, three out of every four weeks.
And are generally pretty good.
And, like, twice as good, twice, three times as good as those crappy pieces of shit that Stouffer's tries to pawn off on people.
for three, four bucks.
Fuck you and your shitty meals.
Okay, that was stupid.
I'm in the bedroom.
It's all good.
All right, I'm in the chatroom, FUs.
Zodiac Knight says, I'd like to send an FU to myself if that's possible.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You're a good kid.
Highland Hypergirl would like to say F you to midterms because I couldn't go to Orange Lounge Radio this week or last week F you to fucking wild 57, WLD57, workload, a workload 57 F you to stupid bikers at Davis who are not using the bike circles F you to stupid pedestrians at Davis who think walking in the middle of the bike circles will get them across the street faster F you to the DDR machine and TAPEX at Davis
F you to more drama and a certain initial D community cop, RTA cop.
F you to the girls who give me dirty looks at Paracon today just because I dress differently than they do and probably look better too.
And F you to the cocky bastards who think they know everything in billiards when they actually suck.
F you to the germs that got you three sick.
Thank you.
F you to Baka for complaining.
And F you to my friend for saying that all Loki does is bitch.
Can I respond to that, Loki?
I think the segment was called Effie of the Week, you know, because that's where you bitch.
I don't know, it's just a thought.
I'm not always bitch.
I haven't been bitching today.
I've been good.
You've been pretty good, I'll give you that.
But now that he mentioned that, I'm going in.
Rice Princess says, Oh, guess what?
I bought actual rice today.
So there, for all those people that said I cook with minute rice, you can suck it.
Are you done?
Are you spent?
Yeah, it's just, you know, fulfilling the bitching part.
Oh, F you the fact that my printer didn't come with the appropriate USB cable to hook it up.
Now it's just sitting there all pretty.
Rice Princess would like to say, Fuck Kentucky Fried Chicken, Popeye's is the best fried chicken ever.
23rd Magus says, F you to having my interview delayed another two weeks.
Fuck this, I'm applying for RadioShap.
F you to thinking you were all studied up for a networking exam, then get a C- on it.
F you to being unable to take the Japanese midterm due to a severe glitch in enrollment.
What the hell is wrong with these fucktards?
So many admins, so few bullets.
F you to being too broke to see Kill Bill again.
And F you to Imperium for being so damn expensive.
I want to have the crazy 88 guild, dammit.
John Fields likes to say, F you to one of my Phantasy Star Online cards corrupting and having to start all over again, my Fomar and Raymar.
F you to Halo not having C co-op two-player mode.
F you to my school having such horrible pings that I can't play Halo online.
F you to the 40 degree days now.
Lastly, F you to not being able to download Fullmetal Alchemist Episode 2 this weekend.
Pixie Dust says, oh yeah, fuck a certain friend who hasn't posted a pic yet.
I love her, but damn, it's been more than two weeks.
Oh yeah, one more.
Fuck me for always having big boobs as usual because I can't find cute tight shirts that fit.
Trust me.
Damn.
Damn, that just sucks.
Oh my god.
You know, next thing, I'm a bitch if I was having too much money, because, you know, whoo!
And she liked to agree, hee-hee, dirty ball-licking truck drivers, damn.
She was agreeing with a previous FU.
Nostylan says, my FU is for not having any Let the Hit Them Remix Ferret Remix.
I don't know, this is Nostylan, okay?
F you to Orange Lounge for not having people on the cam besides Brad.
I mean, where's the rest of the crew?
Well, Loki's working on his computer.
I'm trying to operate the control panel, which is off cam.
They're dead!
They're all dead!

in fun Oh god And I thought Magus told the bad jokes, shit What can you do?
Cough, cough Oh man Alright, we're going to take a quick break and we'll come back
I'm going to talk about some things that you can do to help Bomani out.
There's a few things that you can still do right now to help the Bomani scene out a little bit if you want to.
Do this or die.
And we'll maybe do some Ask Orange Lounge.
So if you have a question for Ask Orange Lounge, remember DarkSakura's not here tonight, so she can't answer your questions.
If you have a question for her, it's going to have to wait.
But if you have something me, Loki, Brad, or Bradley could answer, hey, we'd love to help you out.
Send on a question.
and we'll do the best we can.
Why?
In the meantime, let's hear, I want to hear something from Beatmania Core Mix, I think.
Let's hear Emotion, the romantic style.
No, we don't want to hear that.
Yes, we do.
It was originally in Beatmania Core Mix, though.
That's where it is.
I know, but that was also in Night Style.
Well, you know what?
I don't care.
I want to hear the Yodeler remix of the DJ Battle.
Okay, fine.
We'll hear the Yodeler remix of the DJ Battle.
That's really annoying.
Fine.
Actually, I have a
Do you really think that you can scratch, Will?
Well, if you keep up with my scratch technique, I'll accept you.
Right.
Get ready.
Alright, I'll consider your talent.
Look, the dance floor is waiting for you to start.
If you keep up with my crack techniques, I'll accept you.
Alright, get ready.
Yes, that's a great place.
Look, the dance floor is waiting for you to start.
Christ, that song is annoying.
Oh well, since we put the F-U in fun, here you go.
Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami.
I know you all know Beat Media, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.
Listen carefully and try to follow.
The objects will come down from the top when it hits the red line.
Turn the table!
You get it?
Alright, let's practice!
First, hit the white keys!
Thank you for watching!
It's hard, but you can do it!
Okay, let's exercise!
Here's the spec of the new Pikminya!
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Bitch, get a new song.
An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
We're going to do Ask Orange Lounge here in a little bit.
We got a ton of freaking questions tonight, so we're going to address all your questions.
But first off, I just wanted to say, before the break, I said that there's stuff you can do to help Bomani out right now.
There's a couple things.
First off, 2DX Consumer Style, the new one, at last count, they have about almost just shy of 9,000 responses.
And they only need 10,000.
So in the next nine days, they're going to need 1,000 more responses.
So if we can, you know...
If all the listeners can get in on that, then we'll have it down to a good 998.
I think it's five days from now, like the 24th.
Is it?
I think it's the 24th.
Whatever, I did my math wrong, so whatever.
So there's not a lot of time left, so get your ass over to KonamiStyle and sign that.
I don't have a direct URL for it, sorry guys, but maybe somebody in the chat room will be kind enough to post one.
DarkSakura probably has more than there was like a week, five days ago.
There's a direct link on Bomani Style somewhere, so look for that.
Speaking of Bomani Style, the other thing I was going to say is that they are going to be distributing TAC's new CD, Bounce Connected, but they need to get, I think, about 200 orders for it, and they only have about 75 right now, I think, when I did the math.
Was it...
Oh, I thought it was 25 paid and then 50 reserved.
I thought it was plus 75.
But still, if you guys are interested in picking up Bounce Connected, head on to Bomani Style.
It's right on the top of their page in the bottom left.
And tell them Orange Lounge Radio sent you so they'll think we're cool.
And also, after they get Bounce Connected ordered up, they're going to order more CDs from diverse systems.
One of the CDs called Hello Boss features P8107.
So, you know, that's definitely a CD you're going to want to check out because it's got a ton of awesome remixes by the Japanese artists who are a lot better at remixing Bomani music than the American artists will ever be.
So, ha!
Eat that!
And yes, I do admit they are way better than I am, so...
Alright, so that's what you can do to help Bomani out.
Let's do some Ask Orange Lounge.
Let's Ask Orange Lounge.
Some stupid question.
Baba, I'm not singing because I'm sick, so fuck off.
Alright.
Ask some questions.
You want to sing, Bradley?
Go for it.
Alright.
ViolentHyperGirl would like to know,
My friend Danny, who said Loki bitches too much, wants to know why you guys don't have better quality radio.
I don't know if he means sound-wise.
If you're talking about sound quality, that's because we're staying modem-friendly.
We want modem listeners to be able to access our station because they've supported us since the beginning.
But next month, we're going to go MP3 Pro, which means even if you're on a modem, you can still get DSL-quality sound.
That's going to be exciting.
You know, I forgot to mention something about FUs.
I know this is totally, like, past that segment, but FUs to that stupid Modesto Mitsubishi commercial that lasted a good half hour.
You suck, and that crazy Mexican guy's funny.
And that put that segue into this.
This is why we don't put quality radio out there, because irritating radio stays with you longer than, you know, quality radio.
Quality radio gets forgotten.
Irritating radio stays with you.
I just took a piss.
Thank you.
Um, if you don't like our station, I challenge you to do something better.
Alright.
Or the easy way, just fuck yourself.
But I know that's not what you meant, so hugs and kisses from you to me.
Or from me to you.
Hold on, who was the one who had the question?
Uh, one of ViolentHyperGirl's friends.
Oh.
Sorry I don't know you, I don't want to be mean or anything, but fuck yourself.
My other friend wants to know the purpose of Orange Lounge Radio.
The purpose of Orange Lounge Radio is so that we can make asses of ourselves on the internet.
Yeah, it's to entertain ourselves and not you, so fuck off.
Just kidding.
Nothing but love for all you.
Especially new people.
ViolentHapperGirl also wants to know, when will the next mass Orange Lounge Radio or GB?
And if it's happening soon, will you need my whip?
I don't know and yes.
Probably whenever the next big tournament is.
Although not that one the day after Halloween because I'll be out of town.
So no orgies without me.
Alright.
Moving on.
DarkSakura sent in a question.
Here we go.
DarkSakura wants to know, Dear Orange Lounge, why is DarkSakura so fucking rad?
Because she's a chick that plays video games.
Sky, do you enjoy saying my nick?
You always seem to...
It's 915 and 72 degrees.
In the Sacramento area
Nins would also like to know, Tuesday is coming, did you bring your coat?
It's from Rejected.
Anyway.
Tee hee, Tee hee hee, Rejected joke.
Hello and welcome to last week.
23rd Magus would like to know, where can I find a good international lawyer?
I need to crack down on these illegal Portuguese joke book makers.
Moving on!
Huh?
Yeah, the dead silence reflects everyone everywhere in the response to that segment.
Oh, I totally wasn't paying attention.
The Orange Lounge Madam, Pixie Dust, or Penée Princess, as she'd like to be called tonight.
Okay, here's a real question for Loki.
It's not Penée.
P9 I like saying PNA because it sounds like TNA, which is what Pixie Dust makes me think of.
Here's a question.
Why does Loki make fun of the fact that my FU goes to me having big tits?
You try having big boobs for a week and see how cheap you feel.
I don't even know how to respond to this.
What are you talking about?
He has big boobs.
He has big man boobs.
I have nice sized breasts, but those are all my girlfriends, so you know.
Oh, there you go.
There you go.
I don't feel cheap at all.
Alright.
You know what I say is, use what you got.
I'm going back to some violent hypergirl questions here because she said a bunch.
Can you put the Camel Toe song back in circulation on Orange Lounge Radio?
No.
But you might hear it on one of the spinoff shows, Vanilla Sky, Monday nights at 7 o'clock.
Or pump up the volume, Jamie's spinoff show, Tuesday nights at 7.30.
And if you get really lucky and you give him head, you might hear it on Loki's show, Live Wire, coming back in November on Wednesdays.
Right, Loki?
That's a pretty good one.
I'll tell Nelly.
The other question is... Damn you!
You're never here, so... Her friend wants to know, why am I so violent?
Because it's ViolentHyperGirl.
I would say it's all that pent-up sexual energy.
But you know that can be fixed.
Pent-up sexual energy should be unleashed on the masses.
Pip has a question.
Pip would like to know, what homepads do you guys use?
I have an ignition that I kind of got out of a relationship because my ex has been too lazy to pick it up and I guess doesn't really want to talk to me, so I get an ignition pad out of it, I guess, and I got 2DX 3rd and 4th style out of it.
It's not a bad deal.
but the ignition pad's on loan to Jamie right now so what Loki's putting on our webcam right now are the metal pads he just built and those are the new home pads of choice here also, and somebody else asked this question too where is the ferret right now?
I want to see him on the webcam, please um, the ferrets died sorry oh yeah, where are the ferrets?
the ferrets are hiding hey one of those is mine I have custody of one of them they're dead they're all dead
My Tom Cruise impersonation.
Goddamn ferret.
That is all you'll hear on this show because Jamie's not here.
Yo, they wanted to see it on the cam.
Can you put it on the cam?
Alright.
Kamasaki wants to know, so I've always wanted to ask you guys this.
If you were called Orange Lounge Radio, why don't you just play Orange Lounge Tomosuke songs all day, aside from the fact that they'd repeat after an hour or so?
Well, you hit on the first point, it would get pretty old pretty fast.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And Wet Pussy Radio was already taken, so We couldn't use that one either Such a bummer And because that's what we picked, so fucking clear your mind I know, I wanted to be Wet Pussy Radio really bad But unfortunately it was taken But for the record, we do play like every single Orange Lounge and Tomosuke song They're all in rotation, because Orange Lounge kicks ass And Tomosuke kicks ass Alright, Tomosuke Tomosuke Wasabi Wasabi
Moving on.
John Fields wants to know, Loki, what's your sim file number at now?
I don't know because I actually haven't played Step Mania in like months.
So I have tons of them sitting on my hard drive.
I just haven't gotten there.
Probably up to 4,000 now.
Bubble Bath Phase Radio.
Sweet.
That game sucks.
It would be better if it was Gal's Panic Radio.
Alright.
Go check out
Sexy Pachinko Reaction.
That game is the best freaking hentai arcade game I've ever seen in my life.
Excellent.
Sexy Pachinko Reaction.
That's an awesome radio show name.
By Sammy.
Can I get to the rest of the questions, please?
We all know Sammy, the company responsible for... Come on, anybody?
NoStylin wants to know... You faggot.
When will there be a Loki remix of Mr. Ferret's?
When will there be a Loki remix of Mr. Ferrets?
There's your answer.
When I change my name to Twen?
Zing.
NoStylen also wants to know, How many listeners do you have listening to Orange Lounge Radio right now?
Two and a half.
Two and a half.
You're the half.
How come 23rd Magus has bad jokes?
Well...
Thank you for watching!
and WellEducated.
DarkSakura has another question.
Dear Orange Lounge, where the fuck did all two generals go on Ragnarok?
I want to gain another fucking level.
I'd answer that, but I haven't played Ragnarok in about, oh, three months.
In fact, does anybody in this room play Ragnarok anymore?
Never have, never will.
Show of hands.
I would be if I had money, but I have no money.
Guess you're fucked.
Sorry, Jamie.
Not only are you sick, but we can't answer your question.
Boy, are you screwed tonight.
Love ya.
What?
Where are the generals in Ragnarok?
I don't know.
Rob is a fart smeller.
No, I'm not.
Don't read what chatroom says.
You're one fart smeller.
They spread evil rumors about us.
Have you guys been to that store, Fart and Smile?
No.
Baka wants to know, why is DarkSakura so cool?
We already answered that question.
It's not my fault if you weren't listening.
She's boss.
Because she asked the question herself.
She's far out in a way cool way, man.
She's super rad.
What was the Brady Bunch thing?
You just did like a square thing with your fingers when you said she's totally not square.
That was pretty geeky.
But it was kind of rounded because I didn't make a square right.
It was more of a rectangular rounded shape.
Maybe some sort of oval.
She's like She's like Coolsville, daddy-o.
Alright.
Moving on.
I'm hip to that jive.
Biohazard asked about 20 questions, so I'm saving him for last.
Pixie Dust wants to know, Sky, what would you do if you had a cute gay guy, a popsicle, and a lot of time in a bedroom?
I'd eat the popsicle, then suck his dick, come on!
Fuck him in the ass, then wipe your dick on his curtains.
What possessed you guys to start a radio station in the first place?
Were you high on pot or were you just drunk?
A little bit of both.
Actually, I had already been doing radio through my buddy's radio station, Under Sedation Live.
I'd been studying radio in college, so it was nothing new to me.
DarkSakura had been guesting on Understation Live.
She did a good job when she did it, so I said, Hey, Jamie, why don't we do a show?
She said, Sure!
And then Loki just started showing up, but it's worked out nice.
I was there.
Loki just kind of showed up, and it worked.
Yes, and Jamie would like to add she was also the most frequent guest on Understation Live, which is true.
All right.
Biohazard also wants to know, where can I find remixes of Bomani stuff?
I'll let Loki answer that.
The internet.
You want to be more specific?
Check out, well...
Check out Bomani Sims if you want shit.
Go to Diverse Systems' website.
They have a lot of samples you can find.
I believe it's diverse.co.jp, if I remember correctly.
If not, just check the link on Bomani Cell.
There should be a link to their site, because they're the ones that do Bounce Connected CD.
So find their site and look for the artist names on there and then when you see the artist names like Onokin for instance, just search under like Yahoo or something for Onokin then BMS because all the people that do remixes on there, they make BMS files for the Beatmania Sims and they do awesome remixes on there.
That's how I found P8107 without buying the CD is I just ripped the sound from the BMS file, so...
That's a good place to look.
Just search for Bomani remixes.
You'll also find there's a site that does a compendium of every single remix ever made, and they have it organized by song that's remixed from, and you can find links on there too, so just check that out.
You can find them on my hard drive.
I've got about over 100 of them, quite a big collection of official ones, but you're not going to have them.
Here's my clever answer.
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because we play them.
All right, Biohazard also wants to know, why do you keep saying you are going to burn the ferrets and you don't?
Are you not able to bring yourself to set aflame the Orange Lounge Radio mascot?
Basically, if I burn the ferrets, Jamie would kick my ass, and I know this.
But I'm hoping when she goes away to Alabama, she'll be gone for a good two weeks.
So if I set them on fire just before she leaves, she'll have the whole trip to kind of calm down.
And I'm hoping she'll forget by the time she gets back.
So have a nice trip, Jamie.
Also because one of them isn't yours, and so you don't want to burn other people's stuff.
I would just say, you know, I'm sorry, I thought you had fire insurance.
For the good of all radio, I will set it on fire.
Fire, flammable retardant or whatever.
I'm tired.
Next question, Ask Orange Lounge.
We're going to finish this up and then end the show.
Please do.
We've got to zip through these because there's only like one minute supposedly left in the show.
Why did the chicken, no wait, where did you get that Mobomoga remix you hear in the Orange Lounge Radio intro?
This is what's interesting about it.
You can't find it anywhere.
This 19 seconds that you're hearing right now is all that exists.
There is no full remix of the song.
Here's the way the story goes.
One of our frequent guests that we've had on the show in the past, Navi, his friend, I can't remember his name that he goes by online.
It's like the Great Hamster or something like that?
Well, his name, but it's the Hamster... Hamster... Hamster Alliance.
Hamster Alliance is what he goes by online.
He just...
Navi was urging him to create a Bomani remix for a Bomani Styles remix contest they had a while back.
And he doesn't really like many Bomani songs, so it was a problem.
Mogamoga is probably his favorite song out of all of them.
And he pretty much remixed those 20 seconds and then said, Ah, fuck it!
Which is too bad, because if he had remixed the whole thing... Best remix I've ever heard.
He probably would have won the whole damn thing.
If he would have remixed more Bomani stuff, he'd have more open mind to it.
Thank you for watching!
But the nice thing is, I asked him when he didn't end up entering it in the contest, but I heard it anyway, I asked him, I'm like, hey, I run a station called Orange Lounge Radio with some friends, you know, maybe we could use that?
He's like, yeah, sure.
So, there you go.
Just that whatever, how many, 15 seconds you brought of it?
Like, just that 15 seconds is already the best remix I've ever heard.
Ever.
Uh-huh.
It's so good.
It sounds like Crystal Method remixed it.
That's why I like it.
All right.
We're running a little over here, but I want to address the rest of these questions.
Anybody have info on the StepMania SM Max 4 theme that I haven't heard about for a long time?
I'll defer that to Loki, because he's the StepMania expert around here.
I don't know.
I haven't heard anything about it.
All right.
Don't really care.
They have a good one, though, that supposedly it's pretty good.
It's Transmakina.
That's out right now.
Just look for that on their skinning thread on there.
But if you want information on that, Max, just look at the skinning thread because it would be there if it was anything important.
All right.
Two more here.
Why does the webcam face a very uninteresting area of your living room?
Well, you know what?
There is no interesting area.
Surprise, there is no interesting area.
I know, so what do you expect?
You could open the fridge and get the camera in the fridge.
That would be cool.
That would be cool.
That would be cool.
Alright, last question.
Sorry guys that sent their questions in late, but we're running over here.
Biohazard wants to know, why did you pick Live365 to host your station and not some other place?
Basically because Live365 will pay all the licensing for you as well, and although I would be willing to run a shoutcast station, it's just not possible because of our bandwidth.
Believe it or not, we have too many listeners, and we wouldn't be able to maintain the bandwidth for the live show.
We wouldn't be able to do it.
So, sorry, we're kind of stuck with Live365.
Although, honestly, they're not bad, because they, you know, despite you guys get pop-up ads and all that stuff, considering everything you get, which is licensed, paid-for radio, if you want to blame somebody for the fact that Live365 has to have all these pop-ups, blame the RIAA for enacting those licensing laws and all that shit.
That's whose fault it is, not Live365.
They do the best they can, and I've been happy with them thus far.
And another idea, fucking, fucking, go download Mia...
M-E-A-Y-A pop-up ad blocker.
And you won't have any more stupid pop-ups.
There you go.
And the camera picture makes me look like a torso-less freak.
All right.
Thanks to all you guys for submitting questions.
God, we had a lot of them tonight.
Jeez Louise.
We should do more questions after the... Well, we'll see.
Yeah.
Rebirth.
All right.
That's it for Ask Orange Lounge.
All right.
Time's for everybody's final thoughts.
This is time to wrap up the damn show.
Brad, your final thought.
He said pizza looks so good.
That was before my final thought.
My other final thought is you smell like butt.
Bradley.
Gotta get up, gotta get moving.
You sound like an 80s theme song right there, thank you.
Uh, Loki.
Um, I know I have to drink Theraflute, but, like, lemon tastes like ass, so that sucks.
But I'm gonna drink it anyways, because I found out if you drink it with salt, salt is good, and it cuts the sour.
Jamie sends along a final thought.
She says, God damn, there went my lung.
And she hacks up the other one.
Thank you for that lovely imagery.
My final thought is, fuck being sick.
I hate being sick.
You suck, Mother Nature, and bite me.
That's it.
Thank you everybody for listening and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
We do appreciate it.
Tune in tomorrow night for Vanilla Sky at 7 o'clock.
Tune in Tuesday night for Pump Up the Volume at 7.30.
Tune in 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for the Bomani Music and More program.
All your favorite DDR, 2DX, and Dance Media favorites.
Thanks for your support.
We always appreciate it.
Final word of the show.
Loki, I don't think you've ever had it.
What do you want?
Final word of the show.
Suck.
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
We expect you a nice play again.
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
Well, as Megatron has, how shall we say, departed, I nominate myself as the new leader.
Wait, the Constructicons formed?
Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.
