1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
That changed and I just wonder why

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
All it took was just one smile

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now with you

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Out of the blue

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Lover here

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Before my eyes

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
With you

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Think I'm true

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I never thought I'd

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Realize what love

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What love was, what love was, what love was

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I need you, oh I need you every day

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I love you more and more without you

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I know what is so strong

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Suddenly, I see you there, and everything's okay

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You're the one, I feel this way

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Now it's you, out of the blue

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Love appears before my eyes

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's you, dream come true

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I never thought I'd bring you a life of love, of love, of love

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Here with you

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We are together now.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Never take my heart away.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,000
All the love that fell is here to stay.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Woah, woah, woah

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's like a dream come true

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I never thought I'd fall in love with you

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Love appears before my eyes with you

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It comes true

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I never thought I'd be with you

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Out of the, out of the, out of the, out of the city blue

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh, it's like a dream come true

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I never thought, I never thought

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Out of the blue

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You brought my eyes with you

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Dream come true

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I never thought I'd fall in love with you

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Out of the, out of the, out of the, out of the league

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We are young, hotted, we stand, no promises, no demands, no demands, no promises, no demands.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You make me go, then make me stay Why do you hurt me so bad?

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You would help me to know, do I stand in your wake?

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Or am I the best thing you can?

43
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Believe me, believe me, I can't tell you why

44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But I'm trapped by your love and I'm chained to your lies

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We are young, heartache, heartache, we stand No promises for demand, love is a fantasy

46
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We are young, no one can tell us where to run Searching our hearts for solo love

47
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Both of us knowing, love is of seven feet

48
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We're meant to control, we turn it away

49
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Hold on to me deep inside

50
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And if all this gets old, will it still feel the same?

51
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
There's no way this will die

52
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But if we get much closer, I still lose control

53
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And if your heart's a grandeur, you'll need me too, oh

54
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:30,640
We are young, heartache, heartache, we stand No promises, no delays, love is as good as

55
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:47,640
We are strong, no one can tell us where to run Searching our hearts for some love

56
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:57,640
For the first knowing, love is a battle for you

57
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:32,160
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

58
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,120
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk and then some.

59
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,680
Mostly the and then some part of that.

60
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,320
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

61
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,320
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

62
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,320
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge radio.

63
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,320
Yes, I will spank your child.

64
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,320
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

65
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
Well, here's to my big opening.

66
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,320
A sphincter says what?

67
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,320
I'm super. Thanks for asking.

68
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

69
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,320
What am I doing here?

70
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
Awwww.

71
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
Dodge this.

72
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
Mmhmm.

73
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,320
This is a tasty burger.

74
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,320
Look you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.

75
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,320
Yes I have.

76
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
Look!

77
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
It's a flesh wound.

78
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,320
Searching for a boy in high school isn't useless.

79
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,320
It's searching for meaning in a polyshorn way.

80
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
Oh yeah?

81
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

82
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Dark Sakura.

83
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
I've got a sniff.

84
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
Sky.

85
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

86
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
Loki.

87
00:08:43,320 --> 00:09:12,320
We are live and this is episode number 66.

88
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:35,320
I don't have much of a voice left, that's why I will be speaking in spirit all evening.

89
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
No.

90
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,320
No.

91
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,720
How are you feeling this week?

92
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:52,840
last week better okay in that corner say hello to our tech massa Loki hi also

93
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:59,920
with us tonight we have the one and only Arcadian 42 you know and that's it it's

94
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,280
a small it's a small little studio tonight but that's okay who is the other

95
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,280
special guest, dare I ask?

96
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
The other special guest is my laundry.

97
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
I think it's the webcam.

98
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:15,560
Which smells Mountain Spring fresh at this very moment.

99
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,520
Actually, it smells like Tide.

100
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:25,080
My fabric softener smells like Gain, so it smells like Tide Gain bounce.

101
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,440
Gain makes me think of the Gator network, which makes me cry.

102
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,480
That makes everybody cry.

103
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,040
Of course, we have something that is now even worse than Gator.

104
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,440
something out there. There's a software for your computer. It is worse than Gator. It

105
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,440
is worse than Bonsai Buddy. It is worse than Gator with a Bonsai Buddy. It's the worst

106
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,440
damn software you could ever have on your computer. And we'll be talking about that

107
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,440
later.

108
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
Okay.

109
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,840
But first we're going to take a quick break. We have all sorts of news tonight. How was

110
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,680
your week? How was your day? An exciting DDR story which aired on our local news, which

111
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,120
definitely have to play and make fun of for you all. Another game coming out soon. Could

112
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,600
this be the DDR Killer? We'll see. And Sacramento has a DDR machine in a very odd location all

113
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
coming up after this.

114
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:42,300
So one, two, three...

115
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,300
Oh

116
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,300
I know

117
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:26,300
I can't, but I can't help falling in love with you

118
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:34,300
Shall I say, will I say, see, I will say

119
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:44,300
If I can't help falling in love with you

120
00:13:44,300 --> 00:14:13,300
It's like a river flow, flowing through the sea, flowing through the valley, like hell, something's about to be.

121
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:22,300
Take my hand, take my whole life through

122
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:35,300
I can't help falling in love with you

123
00:15:52,300 --> 00:16:21,920

There's a whole shitload of people there tonight.

128
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,600
Just waiting to talk to you and tell you where our webcam's at if you want to stare at us,

129
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,560
although Jamie never is on cam because- And remember, $2.99 a minute, you know, you

130
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,560
could...

131
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,560
We might have talked to you in other ways.

132
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,560
I don't know.

133
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:59,800
I charge for my P.M. That's the only way you can vote in the cage match and also send your

134
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,560
nephews of the week and all that stuff.

135
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,420
So hello.

136
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,480
So for those of you guys that listen to the show on a regular basis, I'm sure you've heard

137
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,480
Loki in the past talk about his experiences when he goes to Raley's to get Chinese food.

138
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,640
And the lady that works at the Raley's department that always says, you want a sample?

139
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,040
Yes, the sample lady at the Raley's.

140
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:34,000
And I had the chance today, Loki and I went down to Walmart today to run some errands

141
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
and do something else.

142
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,660
So we're going to talk about much later in the show.

143
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,040
We went to Walmart and then we went over to Raley's to get some dinner, because I was

144
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,600
going to get some Chinese food.

145
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,760
And Loki said, hey, this is the Raley's where the sample lady works at.

146
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,960
I was all excited, because I didn't realize that we were going to the Raley's, where the

147
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,320
sample lady works at, because I always thought she worked at another one.

148
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,620
Raley's, for those who don't know, because I forget, it's probably only in California.

149
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,400
It's a big grocery store chain, so Raley's is a big grocery store.

150
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,400
This is the most fucked up Raley's I've ever seen, this Raley's here in Folsom, where we

151
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,400
live.

152
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,300
We have the Rainbow Cafe, first of all, when you walk right in the door.

153
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:12,560
The Rainbow Cafe, it sounds like something that belongs in Lavender Heights in Midtown.

154
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,480
So you have the Rainbow Cafe when you walk through the door, and right next to the Rainbow

155
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,040
Cafe is the takeout place, the hot walk.

156
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,520
So Loki and I walk in, and Loki's like, oh my God, the sample lady's working today.

157
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
That's her.

158
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,520
That's her.

159
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
So I got all excited because I saw the sample lady.

160
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,720
And of course, since I saw the sample lady, there was nothing I wanted more than to hear

161
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,280
her go, you want a sample?

162
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,280
Yes.

163
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,680
So Loki gets up there and ordered his food, and shockingly enough, she didn't say it.

164
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,640
She didn't say it to him.

165
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,600
So I was starting to get a lot upset because I'm like, I can't be here and

166
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,360
not hear the you want sample thing.

167
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,840
So I went up there and I was like, hi, yeah,

168
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,000
can I try a little bit of the garlic chicken?

169
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,200
You know, it's trying to go out, oh, you want sample?

170
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,040
It didn't work.

171
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,960
She didn't say anything.

172
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,760
She just kind of gave it to me and then got my meal and we were gone.

173
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,560
But there was this really stupid guy that was there too.

174
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,800
And after I took my garlic chicken and I ate the little thing because they put it

175
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,560
on a toothpick, they put a piece on a toothpick, so you need it.

176
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,300
He's like, so was it good?

177
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,220
I'm just like, fuck off.

178
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,260
Yes, it was delicious.

179
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,860
Do you want me to spit it back out so you can taste it too?

180
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,700
I mean, fucking ask for yourself and find out for yourself.

181
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,820
Because what I think is really good tasting,

182
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,180
you might fucking hate.

183
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,140
So I actually can stand to drink diet soda.

184
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,220
A lot of people think I'm fucking weird.

185
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,980
Rob.

186
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,940
Yes?

187
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,220
People don't think that you're weird.

188
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,380
Eat me.

189
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,180
Anyway, so I didn't get to hear the you want sample thing.

190
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,300
And then the lady who was checking us out,

191
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,340
she looked like a brunette Donatella Versace,

192
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,060
which kind of scared me a little bit.

193
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,940
Oh my god, that woman is hideous looking.

194
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,420
She looks like droopy.

195
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,620
Welcome to Donatella Versace's Halloween party.

196
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,500
I give you candy, cigarettes.

197
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,100
Here's some candy, here's some cigarettes.

198
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,020
God, I love when they impersonate Donatella Versace

199
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,060
on Saturday Night Live.

200
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,100
Anyway, so the lady who checked us out

201
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:13,600
There were these two kids that were trying to play in one of those power wheelchairs.

202
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,140
You know how if you're handicapped and you go to the grocery store, they give you a complimentary

203
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,140
wheelchair to sit in?

204
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,140
What a complimentary wheelchair.

205
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,300
There were these kids, and I swear to God, they were about ready to ram right into all

206
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,300
the candy.

207
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,300
It was funny.

208
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,820
But I'm really upset because I didn't get to hear the you want sample thing, so I just

209
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,820
have to rely on Loki.

210
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,820
Loki is the only one that can do it.

211
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:38,940
And then he had to go, I'm trying to train her not to offer the samples, because she

212
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,020
does it at the wrong times.

213
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,260
You already get your food, she's already given it to you, it's all ready to go.

214
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,380
I got sweet and sour pork, and she'll give me a sample of sweet and sour pork like, gee,

215
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,700
I didn't know what it tasted like.

216
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,140
Oh my God, that's so good, maybe I should get some.

217
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,020
Oh wait, I already did.

218
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,020
She's so retarded.

219
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:03,380
And then on Friday, they had a person that was even dumber than she was, this old guy,

220
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,180
He was like, oh, you want food?

221
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,540
You want Chinese?

222
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,100
What kind of rice do you want?

223
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,860
And it's like so fucking annoying.

224
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,500
They're so slow.

225
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,180
They're like operating in another dimension.

226
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,420
They operate in the process.

227
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,540
Freaking old.

228
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,220
But yeah, they sucked.

229
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,420
And then Rob had to go and ask for a sample and actually

230
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,460
thinks it's OK to ask for samples.

231
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,660
And then she went back to asking people for samples.

232
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,980
God damn it.

233
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,940
You messed it all up for me.

234
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,940
I swear to God, she recognized you when we walked in there.

235
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,140
We walked in and she looked at you with that, hi, look on her face.

236
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,900
I was kind of like, oh, she recognizes Loki as a frequent customer.

237
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:48,500
But what was so weird is right before you went up there to get helped, she started staring

238
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,700
off into space.

239
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,260
She was staring at some person on the other end of the store.

240
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,820
And mind you, there's a line of five people there waiting at the counter.

241
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,100
She's looking at her ancestors.

242
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,660
She's staring off into space, yeah.

243
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:06,200
seeing the ghost of Christmas past in front of her or something. It's fucking crazy.

244
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,600
But the woman's entertaining, so I'll continue to patronize that really. If for nothing else,

245
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,560
then good stories to fill up time on Orange Laundry Radio.

246
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:20,520
I have plenty of things I could patronize. In a completely different sense.

247
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,240
Let's start off the lovely show with How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, our favorite

248
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,360
way of letting you know what's going on in our lives. It sounds like Jamie wants to start.

249
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,920
Oh God, that gives me a headache. Jamie, how was your past two weeks in your day? You were

250
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:40,560
out last week for sickness. Oh my God, Thursday. Wait, how long have you been sick now? Like

251
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:47,320
three weeks? No. Do you have SARS? No. No, I started to get sick around Wednesday-ish

252
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,680
and Thursday. Dan's like, hey, let's go out and have dinner and shit. And so I'm like,

253
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,180
Okay.

254
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,360
Wait, you had dinner and shit?

255
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,140
Shut up.

256
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,860
Everything makes you shit.

257
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,380
Anyway.

258
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,140
Not soup.

259
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,360
With my digestion.

260
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,820
Anyway.

261
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,320
All right.

262
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,920
It could be like chunky, creamy cheese soup or something.

263
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,600
Moving on.

264
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,400
Anyway.

265
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:16,920
I'm sorry.

266
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,800
Could you repeat that revelation for our listeners?

267
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,800
The beef soup makes your urine smell like beef.

268
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,800
If you go around and smell it, it's a fact. It's just like honey smacks.

269
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,800
Honey smacks makes your urine smell like honey smacks.

270
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,800
It's quite fascinating.

271
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,800
Honeycomb, honeycomb, we want honeycomb.

272
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,800
Honeycomb doesn't do anything. It's just honey smacks

273
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,800
and beef soup. I don't know.

274
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,560
The blue wine punch makes your urine green.

275
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,560
It's kind of weird.

276
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:56,520
So if you were to eat beef sloop with honey smacks on the side, would your urine turn

277
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,320
into this sudden stink bomb?

278
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,280
You could just whip it out and pow.

279
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,160
Hey, what about my week?

280
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,160
Sorry.

281
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,160
Okay, freaking piss sniffers.

282
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,160
Okay.

283
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:19,640
Okay, maybe it's different for a woman because you sit when you pee so you don't really smell

284
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,780
it because it's kind of contained in the potty, right?

285
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,780
The smell is right.

286
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:30,040
But when you're a guy, you're whipping it out and you pee right there and what?

287
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,480
I'm just saying, I'm just saying, you can't help it.

288
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,480
What?

289
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:41,520
I seriously think that's why some guys sit when they pee.

290
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,520
Okay.

291
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,360
Everyone here in the studio does have their pants on.

292
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,440
I don't know what the hell they're talking about.

293
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,000
We can fix that.

294
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,640
Hey now, what the hell is that big black stitch?

295
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,640
I don't know.

296
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,520
Bradley sort of looks like he's not wearing pants in the webcam.

297
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,600
Oh, your head's in the camp.

298
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
Sorry, Jamie.

299
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
You okay?

300
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:07,080
You sure you want to talk about your week here?

301
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,080
Okay.

302
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,080
Do you want something to drink?

303
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,440
You want some honey smacks?

304
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,760
I had beef soup, but now all I have is chicken soup.

305
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,760
Okay.

306
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,520
Fucking go in the bathroom and take a pee right now, because I'm sick of hearing about

307
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
your urine.

308
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,520
Okay?

309
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
Okay?

310
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:37,400
Okay, if you have to pee, stop talking about it, just get in the bathroom and pee.

311
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,000
We have so many Jamie quotes in like the past like two minutes right there to use in the

312
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,760
next intro.

313
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,800
Not to mention that the blue light punch turns your stool green also.

314
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,680
You are in the perfect position for me to just knock you right out of your chair.

315
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,680
Actually that would be my chair.

316
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,840
Knock you right out of Logie's chair.

317
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,840
I could throw the ferret at you, but that's too much effort.

318
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,840
How was your week?

319
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,840
How was your day?

320
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,840
Two weeks.

321
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,920
I was sick the whole time.

322
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,040
I guess as everyone can tell, I still have this nasty cough.

323
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:20,280
Last week, when I called in, as you can probably vouch for this, I sounded really shitty.

324
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,520
I was getting dizzy in my chair.

325
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,600
I ran fever all weekend, I ran fever at work, but it's nothing that's like super contagious

326
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,520
it's a sinus infection.

327
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,460
But I didn't know that time I thought that I had like leukemia and emphysema at the same

328
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,460
time.

329
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,320
No, Dan thought I had emphysema, that was funny, he's like, he was mistaking emphysema

330
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,920
for bronchitis.

331
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,640
Isn't emphysema something smokers get?

332
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,640
Yeah.

333
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,840
And you quit quite some years ago, didn't you?

334
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,840
Like five and a half years ago.

335
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,840
Yeah, so that's weird.

336
00:26:49,840 --> 00:27:01,880
Anyway, so all the snot in my nose that's been consistently draining since I had this

337
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:07,560
infection start has been going right into my lungs, and then I've been, of course, coughing

338
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,560
it all back up.

339
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:16,840
I sound like I'm going to die every moment, and then I got over all the nasty fever, shakes,

340
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:21,640
those symptoms, but I cough myself into headaches now, which sucks.

341
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,000
I have a headache right now.

342
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,480
It got bad enough that Tuesday when I was doing laundry, I stopped breathing for a little

343
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
bit.

344
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
I had to go lay down.

345
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:40,720
I took three puffs off my Ibuterol, laid down, and it felt better finishing my laundry, but

346
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,720
I called the doctor the next day.

347
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,720
They gave me more asthma medicine that night.

348
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,200
And then they said, I get a call the next day that says, either come into the doctor

349
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,600
or if we can't schedule you, go to the emergency room.

350
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,640
So I was like, okay, oh shit, that's like pretty, pretty bad.

351
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:02,600
So I went to the doctor, turns out I had sinus infection, drainage.

352
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,040
And then they prescribed me more drugs.

353
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:10,120
So now I'm on an antibiotic and I'm on Robitussin with codeine.

354
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,440
Robitussin, Robitussin.

355
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:20,960
I swear at night, okay, you know me and my insane tolerance for alcohol, coding will

356
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,700
just totally screw my head up, so I take it before bed and I'm really groggy when I wake

357
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,160
up in the morning and dizzy and all kinds of fun stuff, so I'm on all kinds of drugs

358
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,160
now.

359
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:36,360
On top of that, my voice sounds really crappy and I work in a call center, so I'm hoping

360
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:44,000
that I get over this crap before I go to Alabama. That's next Tuesday. I'm going to be on a

361
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:53,560
plane next Tuesday. Anyway, so that's also why I sound really crappy. I'm about to spew

362
00:28:53,560 --> 00:29:01,440
up one of my lungs on your carpet so you can put it on the webcam.

363
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,980
All right. Well, feel better soon. I mean, that kind of sucks that you have to go back

364
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:11,280
to work tomorrow and talk, but on the bright side, maybe, you know, it'll build something

365
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:21,120
up, the talking. I don't know how that works. You have no idea how gross it is. I can kind

366
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,640
of imagine because I know that, you know, as somebody in my position, I have to talk

367
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,360
a lot of times all day long too when I'm teaching. I talk loud too because I'm teaching. And

368
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:36,320
And usually if I go for a while, like if we're in between classes and I'm not talking a lot

369
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,840
loud and it takes me a little while, those first couple days when I get back in a class,

370
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:49,960
where I have to kind of build up my voice again, so cough, cough, cough.

371
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,200
Don't talk to me about actually coughing up everything, it's really gross.

372
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,000
Luckily I haven't had to go through being sick and trying to do all that yet, but who

373
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:07,200
who knows, maybe someday. Okay, so let's move on. Let's talk to Bradley. Bradley, how was

374
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,320
your day and how was your week? And I think I'm sitting on the cord. Sorry, we'll give

375
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:19,600
you a little more room there. My bad. That's as long as you're going to get to go. Oh,

376
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:27,240
I have the wrong one. There we go. Now it's all untangled. Well, this week not too much

377
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:33,800
happened. Sat around most of the day doing not much. Actually, I shipped out 20 or so

378
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:44,100
packages to various places in the U.S. and six other countries. On Tuesday, I finally

379
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:52,040
went by Fireside Lanes, which is like a mile from where I live. Went and checked out their

380
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,680
DDR Extreme, and it's in pretty good shape, so I played two games then, then went back

381
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:07,040
on Thursday and played six, and now my foot hurts from all that stomping. Let's see what

382
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:16,520
else. And yesterday I fixed up my 2DX controller a bit, so I can actually play some 2DX the

383
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,400
first time at home for the first time in like two months.

384
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,760
God, I haven't played 2DX at home in a long time.

385
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,560
I'm really hoping that, well, I mean, maybe we'll talk about it later, but I'm just hoping

386
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,760
that there is, in fact, a new consumer style coming out.

387
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,000
And yes, I know they've got all the signatures, and da-da-da-da-da, we'll address it later.

388
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,440
I just really hope it happens and they don't try to dick us somehow.

389
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
Yeah.

390
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,880
It better not suck, too, considering we've had to wait like a year and a half at least,

391
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,880
if not two years.

392
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,040
Probably going to have to wait two years for this new 2DX, basically, from the time we

393
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,040
got the last one.

394
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:55,440
If it sucks, Konami can, like, just go to hell. I don't know.

395
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,900
It better be good. It better have, like, 300 songs on it. Sorry.

396
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,000
Well, hang on.

397
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,940
And then, let's see, what else?

398
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:15,540
If anything happened, not really much else happened.

399
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:23,700
more 2DX a day and passed a few new things that was like played a few courses and passed

400
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:32,580
a few new ones. That's about everything that happened this week. Alright, on to someone

401
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,580
else.

402
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:39,740
Loki, how was your day? How was your week?

403
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:44,940
I didn't do anything today except for work on my cabinet a little bit and it's come along

404
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:50,400
quite well. I'm on my last sheet of stuff to cut out, and the only thing that's holding

405
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:56,120
me back is the damn battery power in the jigsaw. I mean, otherwise I would have been done today,

406
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:03,240
but yeah, once it's all cut out, which will be this week, I will start putting it together.

407
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:11,040
And then comes the wonderful job of finding out where we're going to put it. Yeah. No,

408
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:16,040
Anyways, earlier this week, I said we'd just get rid of the couch.

409
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:21,840
Well, I mean, what I was thinking is that we move that small chair somewhere, put the

410
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:27,200
couch against the window, put the cabinet where her chair is, because obviously the

411
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,920
... You okay?

412
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,220
Okay.

413
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:37,840
Obviously the camera would be on top of the cabinet sitting somewhere, and then, I don't

414
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,000
I don't know, we'll figure out where to put the other chairs.

415
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,140
Maybe burn that or something.

416
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,260
I'll figure it out.

417
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:50,480
But then today, before the show, as you might have seen on the webcam if you're watching,

418
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,780
I was calibrating the TV to look nicer,

419
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,500
which I don't really notice anything, but whatever.

420
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,480
Actually, I noticed that the chat room's more readable than usual, except when people use colors.

421
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:09,320
But anyway, so we were watching that and said,

422
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:14,400
do not go beyond your abilities or something and showed someone like trying

423
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,200
to pry off something on a circuit board and getting electrocuted

424
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,060
and the house started getting electrocuted and then it burst into flames.

425
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:24,300
And that was great because the house caught on fire and we had laughed.

426
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,300
And then what else?

427
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:38,300
Oh, not much. I ordered the rest of my parts for my cabinet. I ordered my buttons for popping music, so those are coming, along with my bezel for the monitor.

428
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:43,300
You know, the little black thing that goes around it so it doesn't look like a TV, it looks more like an actual monitor.

429
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:54,300
And then, um, yeah, it should be coming together pretty fast. So, that's about it. Yeah. Not too much.

430
00:34:54,300 --> 00:35:00,840
Alright, oh and saw scary movie three this weekend. That was funny. I heard it shattered like a gazillion records

431
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,940
How was it? It was pretty good

432
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:08,280
It was just you know like you hear the names like airplane and naked gun your expectations are high

433
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,820
What the movie's supposed to be and it was good. It was really funny

434
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:17,500
I was like a first movie that I've seen a long time actually made me laugh out loud in the movie theater

435
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:23,120
But you know a lot of the jokes were ruined from the previews

436
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,840
See, that's why I didn't want to watch those clips, because I knew it wouldn't ruin the

437
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,840
movie.

438
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
Well, no, no, no, not those.

439
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,840
I'm talking about like the previous.

440
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,600
Like one of the funniest ones, like the Michael Jackson thing, you know?

441
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
Oh, I see.

442
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,600
It's like stuff like that.

443
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,600
But it was good.

444
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,600
It was good.

445
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,600
All right.

446
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
Sounds good.

447
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
So that's it.

448
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,600
Nothing else to say about your week?

449
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
No.

450
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
All right.

451
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
My week and my day.

452
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,040
I had a pretty boring week.

453
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,040
Nothing too exciting.

454
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,200
I think I've kind of gotten sick of going to golf land to play F-Zero and all that,

455
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,800
Because I don't know, F-Zero, now that I've unlocked pretty much everything,

456
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,760
it's kind of like lost its flair a little bit.

457
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,360
I mean, it's still a fun game and it's way better than Initial D.

458
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,280
But I'm just kind of, I'm bored with it now.

459
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,760
Plus what's weird about Golf Land, the local arcade that a lot of us play at,

460
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,160
is that they now have two Initial D machines for

461
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,080
a total of four cars to play Initial D with.

462
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,720
Totally unnecessary, that money could have gone towards something else.

463
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,400
The initial D isn't even that popular anymore, except maybe on Friday and Saturday nights

464
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
there's a wait.

465
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,160
I'll probably use that to fix or beat maybe a machine.

466
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,600
The nights I usually go there, Tuesdays, Thursdays, empty.

467
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,520
There's maybe one person playing constantly throughout the night, enough that one machine

468
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,520
could handle.

469
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,520
I don't know why they got a second one.

470
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,640
It's kind of unnecessary.

471
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,480
And then DDR Extreme's still cool, I guess.

472
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,160
I'm still trying to AAA stuff.

473
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,640
I don't think I got anything new this week, but I'm working on my heavy AAAs.

474
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:57,000
a lot of single digit grades, but no heavy AAAs, but I'm working on it. For some reason

475
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:05,320
I want my PA to get better, not that I'm ever going to be that great, but I can try. And

476
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,920
then pretty much I've been working on my game of Final Fantasy X. I won't spoil where I'm

477
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:15,000
at. I won't give a spoiler. I'll just say I'm at Mount, what the hell is it called?

478
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,360
Mount Gagazil, I think it's called. That's where I'm at right now, for those of you who

479
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:24,900
play the game. So I think by my estimations I'm probably about halfway, somewhere between

480
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:30,040
halfway and two thirds through it. So still a ways to go and I'm trying to burn through

481
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:34,760
it before Final Fantasy XI comes out on Wednesday except I don't see that really happening because

482
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,240
I've got vanilla sky tomorrow night and then Final Fantasy XI comes out Wednesday. Now

483
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,280
the interesting thing is I work a short week next week. I'm only working Monday and Tuesday

484
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,420
because I have three days off.

485
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,880
I'm supposed to go to Hollywood for Halloween,

486
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,000
but I foresee that the trip might be canceled.

487
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,620
I'm going to find out for sure tonight.

488
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,300
So if the trip ends up getting canceled,

489
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,780
that means I'm pretty much going to be stuck here,

490
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,580
and I'm going to do nothing but play Final Fantasy 11,

491
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,780
because I'm a freak.

492
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,260
So that's it.

493
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,820
A bunch of us Orange Lounge radio listeners

494
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:07,540
will let you know what Final Fantasy 11 server

495
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,420
we're going to be on.

496
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,660
I haven't, I've kind of been staying away

497
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,900
from information on the game.

498
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,100
I've looked at the benchmark.

499
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:18,120
looked at the demo I watched Brad lanky style if you listen to vanilla sky he

500
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:23,520
he's on there a lot he was a beta tester for Final Fantasy 11 so I saw it a little

501
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,620
bit over there but other than that I really been kind of just keeping it a

502
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,560
surprise what all is gonna wait for me Final Fantasy 11 I haven't read up on

503
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,680
the classes or anything so it should be exciting but the thing is is that come

504
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,360
Wednesday I want to make sure I get the game like I want to be one of the first

505
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,820
people with the game because I want to make sure the name I want doesn't

506
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:44,660
doesn't fucking get taken, because I hate that shit when people steal my name. It's

507
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:53,700
my name. Back off. I have a radio show and you don't, therefore I'm entitled to the name.

508
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:58,200
And that's pretty much it. So it's kind of just anticipating my vacation next week. Yay.

509
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,920
And then not a whole lot too exciting this week. I haven't been to play 2DX in like six

510
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,500
weeks. I haven't been to Scandi in a while. Just golf land. And playing stuff here. Playing

511
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:11,380
Castlevania. Loki bought the new Castlevania game and I'll talk more about that tomorrow

512
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:17,900
night. Okay, I think we're going to do, we're going to go to a break and when we come back

513
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,700
we'll talk about some more news and some things going on in the Milani world. I think maybe

514
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:27,900
we'll do the news story next. We had a news story that aired locally here in Sacramento,

515
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:33,180
California where we all live and it's comedy so you guys definitely want to stay tuned

516
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,880
to listen for this because we're going to play it for you guys and make fun of it because

517
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:43,120
that's what we do. We'll be back after a set of some five key Beatmania songs. This should

518
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:50,120
be fun. We will be right back.

519
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:48,120
.

520
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:53,120
.

521
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:58,120
.

522
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:03,120
.

523
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,120
.

524
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:52,120
I'm out to play, gonna have me some fun In a world that is totally mine

525
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,120
showing my

526
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,120
my

527
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,120
my

528
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,120
my

529
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,120
my

530
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,120
my

531
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,120
I'm on the floor, feel myself in the light

532
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,120
Moving shoulders

533
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,120
to your feet

534
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,120
As I'm turning

535
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,120
I'm still with the light

536
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,120
So my heart comes to my feet

537
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,120
When I

538
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,120
dance I'm feeling the love

539
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:24,120
The light, measure I stay with the keys

540
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:28,120
As the movie happens, I'm still with the sky

541
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:35,120
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B gave me

542
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,120
and join us on all the fun together.

543
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,840
But hey, if you're a broke ass like I am,

544
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,800
why don't you come to the one place

545
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,540
that costs absolutely nothing to go to

546
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,480
and still the fun is just as great.

547
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,000
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

548
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,320
Kick it with me and you just might realize

549
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,200
the best things in life are free.

550
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,540
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio,

551
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,200
episode number 66.

552
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,600
Okay, so shifting gears a little bit,

553
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,200
we wanted to cover this.

554
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,640
We have in Sacramento our local UPN affiliate.

555
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,440
So right off the bat, you know this is going to be class television, okay?

556
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:35,160
We have our local UPN, United Paramount Network.

557
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,160
United Post-A-Mock.

558
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,920
United Crappy Television Network.

559
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,480
United Wrestling Network.

560
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,480
Hey.

561
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,480
It's the only thing they're famous for.

562
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,480
I like SmackDown.

563
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,600
Well, that's the only show they've got, basically.

564
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,600
That and Enterprise.

565
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,600
And Black Television.

566
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,660
And yes, the leader in Black Television.

567
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:56,420
So anyway, UPN did this story about Dance Dance Revolution, and this aired on our local

568
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:00,860
affiliate channel 31 here in Sacramento and we wanted to play the story for you

569
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,540
as you can see you know what the real people out there have to say about DDR

570
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:09,820
so if we're gonna fire up the clip here and we will be us of course stopping it

571
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:16,580
and interjecting our own snide comments occasionally so here we go

572
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:20,020
which we're just waiting for it to load are you gonna put on TV so Jamie can see

573
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:25,020
too you don't think it'll work over there Jamie you have to come here if you

574
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:29,020
you want to see it otherwise you have to just listen.

575
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,020
When you think of video games, what comes to mind?

576
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,020
The joystick, the chair, the set of steady eyes?

577
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,020
It's not very loud.

578
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,020
Can you turn it up?

579
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:38,020
This is the home version on PlayStation right now of DDR,

580
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,020
which we talked about at the top of the show,

581
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,020
because gone are the days of Pac-Man fever, the Donkey Kong

582
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,020
craze.

583
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,020
This is an interactive video that swept the nation.

584
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,020
It's definitely not for couch potatoes.

585
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,020
And GES' Tara Moriarty is shaking her groove,

586
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:54,020
saying it's John's incredible pizza in Stockton.

587
00:45:54,020 --> 00:46:05,020
They basically have economics playing in the background on a widescreen TV in the studio.

588
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:14,140
Then they got some dumb bitch on the spot in John's famous pizza, which is pretty much

589
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,140
like Chuck E. Cheese.

590
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,100
It's got tons of rides and stuff.

591
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:21,620
They actually have carnival rides in there, which is pretty sweet.

592
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:32,620
We're playing DDR Max 2 with all the employees who aren't working.

593
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,620
You said Justin is not there tonight?

594
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:35,620
No.

595
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,620
Justin is...

596
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:37,620
He's not being let in.

597
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,620
My bodyguards...

598
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,620
Justin Timberlake.

599
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:40,620
Okay.

600
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,620
Not letting him in.

601
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:42,620
Okay.

602
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:43,620
But you are going to compete.

603
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:44,620
We're having a dance-off right now.

604
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,620
Let's show...

605
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:46,620
This is Adam.

606
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:47,620
They're having a dance-off.

607
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,620
I was hoping that they could compete.

608
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,620
There's two employees on the machine playing something on basic.

609
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,620
Everyone in home could vote on who was better.

610
00:46:50,620 --> 00:47:01,620
And joining me is Yoshi. You have been doing this machine work here at John's Incredible Pizza and you've been actually practicing on this machine after work when everybody's gone home and you're really good.

611
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,620
Yes I am. I've actually been...

612
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:07,620
Pause it, pause it, pause it. What a conceited little bastard.

613
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:11,620
So I hear you're good at DDR. Well yes I am actually.

614
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:15,620
God, I would have loved to have been there to kick his ass.

615
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:19,900
They're not talking to the person on the machine, they're talking to some guy off the machine.

616
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,640
We're going to see him play at the end of the story.

617
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,140
Everybody else I know that plays DDR, anybody that's good in tournaments and stuff like

618
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,140
that, it's like this thing.

619
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,540
Don't get me wrong, this thing bugs me too.

620
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:32,380
You ask somebody if they're good at DDR, you could be talking to somebody who comes in

621
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:36,220
like top three in tournaments and they'll go, yeah I'm okay, yeah I'm okay, yeah I play

622
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,480
it sometimes.

623
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:44,460
Sometimes DDR community is just like over humbled-fied, you know what I mean?

624
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,580
If somebody asks me how good I am at DDR, I'm going to say, well, let me just put it

625
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:50,660
this way, I kind of used to play it a lot.

626
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:55,780
Yeah, that's more my response, I just say, I haven't played for a few years.

627
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:56,780
I've practiced a lot.

628
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,780
All right, move on.

629
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:58,780
I think you have to hit play.

630
00:47:58,780 --> 00:47:59,780
Yeah, you have to hit play.

631
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,780
And so, who does this?

632
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:01,780
I mean, old people, young people?

633
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,780
Everybody, now and then, they come, they try, and they really have fun on this game.

634
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:10,020
play and so who doesn't I mean old people young people everybody now and

635
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,260
then they come they try and they they really have fun on this game even if

636
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:17,580
they're not good they can really dance what's the key because I mean I think

637
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:22,220
it's really difficult actually the key is to listen to the beat and just watch

638
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:27,400
the arrows go from bottom to top and hit the corresponding step and be

639
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,400
You're doing like the light version.

640
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,400
You can do heavy, moderate, or light.

641
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,400
Yes, there's three difficulty settings.

642
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,400
There's light, standard, and heavy.

643
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,400
Okay, we're going to cut over to Lloyd and Beth so we can see how they are stacking up

644
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,400
against this competition here.

645
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,400
Let's take a look.

646
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,400
Are you guys ready?

647
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,400
Oh, yeah.

648
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,400
Tara, we're picking our song.

649
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,400
Pause it.

650
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:53,480
So, okay, so they're having this dance off, quote unquote, between the people playing

651
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,240
in the arcade and then the two hosts in the studio.

652
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,820
I don't know how the fuck that works, but they're having a dance off, which means we're

653
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:04,500
going to make asses of ourselves all at the same time on this game.

654
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,940
He looks completely unenthusiastic.

655
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:13,500
These people don't need to be touching this software at all.

656
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:17,600
This is why old people... I'm sure these guys aren't touching the software.

657
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,900
That's what interns are for.

658
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,260
I used to be an intern at a television station.

659
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,920
Trust me, that's what the interns are there for.

660
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,460
These guys don't have to know shit about the game.

661
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:31,900
fucking stupid. But anyways, let's watch and laugh at them as they make an ass of themselves.

662
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,860
And in response, yeah, they were playing the whistle song at the beginning. I'm not going

663
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:40,060
to pick the maniac level. No, no, no, no, no, no. Basic. I'm a basic guy. Use your arms

664
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:45,060
with it too. Come on, you're a big boy. Just bounce, just bounce. Okay, ready? Left, left,

665
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:54,060
left. The guy is not even looking at the screen and they're playing dive. You're not bad,

666
00:49:54,060 --> 00:50:08,700
Okay, basically what's happening now is the male host of the show is dancing and he's

667
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,340
looking like he's doing the chicken dance.

668
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:14,140
He's trying to play DDR, it's like nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

669
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:17,300
And they're playing dive, which kind of sounds like the chicken dance anyway.

670
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:23,260
And then the girl host, I shouldn't say girl, the old woman host, is leaning, she's leaning

671
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:28,300
over and going, okay, up, up, left, left, right, up, up, up, down. It's like, fuck,

672
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:32,120
you know, if I was just starting out at DDR, that would just throw me off. You know, she's

673
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:36,000
not able to read them as fast as they're coming up the screen. I would have turned around

674
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,580
and bitch slabbered and said, stop it. I'm making a big ass out of myself on television

675
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:46,380
as it is. Leave me alone. Move on. We'll give you the link to the video at the end. Oh,

676
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:53,040
and look, they failed. Pause, pause. It took them a whopping 15 seconds to fail dive. Whoever

677
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,840
decided to pick a four-foot song for these two incompetent hosts to play on the start

678
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:03,280
of... That was a bad mistake. That intern is so fired. That intern is so genius. He's

679
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,640
like, I fucking hate those bastards. They make me do all their fucking work for them.

680
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:12,640
I'll make them look like fools on TV. And now the male host is so shocked that he failed.

681
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:21,160
He has Sylvester Stallone face. He's got like, ooh, ooh dream, ooh foot trip. Meanwhile,

682
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:28,160
employees are still going at it on the whistle song. And not working. Uh oh. And uh, okay

683
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:37,200
here it goes. So now the female host is asserting her authority and just yanking the other two

684
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:48,640
So now the female host is asserting her authority and just yanking the other two employees off

685
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:54,720
the machine and letting the third employee, who happens to be a DDR maniac here, put in

686
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,720
his coin.

687
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:59,320
And then you get to pick your own song.

688
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,640
Pick your own song, pick your own difficulty level.

689
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,240
Oh, chords in Japanese.

690
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,440
Take out who you want to play,

691
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,760
which is one right now. This game will give you a teaser.

692
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,880
It's max two, by the way.

693
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,880
20 seconds.

694
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,120
Okay.

695
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,520
He's gonna do the heaviest difficulty possible,

696
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,600
and this guy, I mean, this is like a workout.

697
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,080
I mean, if you don't want to go to aerobic class, or...

698
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,520
So you go straight for a healing, vision, and angelic mix,

699
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,280
because he's gonna show how big his dick is

700
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,120
right here on TV.

701
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,360
Just, we'll just fade out here, Beth.

702
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:29,400
just catch this guy says ready and then he just follows the arrow and he also

703
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,120
picked the song with a woman's gonna have to stretch for like 20 seconds to

704
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:35,240
build this blank spot everybody starts gathering around and then you have these

705
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:43,160
little dance-offs look at him go I'm so fucking amazed

706
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:47,680
get a kick out of this okay Cara thanks a lot I could see my reflection listing

707
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:52,240
of area locations for dance dance dance revolution positive playstation by the

708
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,280
Pause it.

709
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,880
God, she did not go dance, dance, dance.

710
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,160
Yes, she just said dance, dance, dance, revolution.

711
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:58,920
Too big.

712
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,440
It's like either she read the teleprompter wrong

713
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,920
or something happened.

714
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,440
You're playing dance, dance, dance, revolution.

715
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,120
Oh, is there going to be a RPG mode?

716
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,160
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance,

717
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,680
dance, revolution, revolution.

718
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,760
Let the bitch finish.

719
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,760
And Xbox is going to come out with a version that's DDR UltraMix, and

720
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,920
the one we have in our studio is thanks to Jim and Suzanne Eckes.

721
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,040
So check- Okay, and then that's it, it just cuts off.

722
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,200
Notice how they say nothing about economics in there.

723
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,080
They say nothing about, Max 2 is out now and you can buy it.

724
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,640
This is further proof that Microsoft is trying to buy out the world with this

725
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:40,680
stupid Xbox thing.

726
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,480
Because there's another place, and we'll talk about this later in the show,

727
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,000
where they have a huge advertisement for DDR.

728
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,280
On the Xbox, they say nothing about, oh, Max 2 available now.

729
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,240
It's all about, no, the Xbox version's coming out.

730
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:54,740
What?

731
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:58,640
When she said right at the beginning of the thing that she said for PlayStation.

732
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,240
But she was playing Kinomics.

733
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,640
She wasn't even playing what's available right now.

734
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,880
And thanks to these two people who are probably interns or something,

735
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,360
just brought it in.

736
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,960
I would have been like, oh, fuck this Yoshi bitch, man.

737
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,200
I want to fucking do doubles and kick his ass.

738
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,400
And be like, oh, man, that makes me so wet and hot

739
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,640
because he's so sexy, he's better than that Asian man.

740
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,200
Oh man, I want a piece of that.

741
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,840
And then they would have all been like,

742
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,600
oh my God, he is so cool.

743
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,760
You know what, Rob?

744
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,280
I think we need to write down and say,

745
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,120
hi, we host a radio station about Bimani

746
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,480
and we think you're stupid.

747
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,680
Love, Orange Zones Radio.

748
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,920
I will write that letter if you want me to.

749
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,140
I will write that letter telling them, you know,

750
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:40,980
that their article was-

751
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,320
They should interview us.

752
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,880
You know what though?

753
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,640
I don't think we need to waste our time with it.

754
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,760
I'm gonna be honest with you.

755
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,160
I just, you know, let it be, whatever.

756
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,600
We've got bigger fish to fry

757
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,360
than trying to get our faces on UPN network.

758
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,000
All right, if you want to watch that story

759
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,920
and laugh at it yourself,

760
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,100
the link is www.upn31.com

761
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,120
and Telemores Lounge Radio sent you.

762
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,140
The link there, by the way,

763
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:12,080
is on the bottom right of the page.

764
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:16,800
It says, Beth and Lloyd cut a rug in a video game dance-off.

765
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,760
Who the fuck says cut a rug anymore?

766
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,680
I just ate Taco Bell, and I've got to cut a rug right now.

767
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,560
Hello, and welcome to The Cut Piece.

768
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,480
That's cut the cheese.

769
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,080
Oh, man, I've got to cut a rug.

770
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:34,000
Rob, that's cut the cheese.

771
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,520
Whenever I hear cut a rug, it makes

772
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:39,160
me think of farting, or queefing, probably.

773
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,000
Ew.

774
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,640
I got to vibrate the rug a little bit.

775
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:48,400
Cutting a rug, isn't that what porn stars do, they get prepared for their videos, they

776
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,840
cut their rug and make sure the carpet's all trimmed.

777
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:54,920
That's called shaving their private area.

778
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,560
Cutting a rug doesn't make me think of dancing.

779
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,280
Dancing and cutting a rug are completely different.

780
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:05,240
To cut a rug, you have to be bent over in actually cutting the rug with a knife or something,

781
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:15,880
Whereas dancing, you're gyrating about to music, so I don't get it, stupid hippies.

782
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:20,760
All right, we're going to take a break, and when we come back, we're going to talk a little

783
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,720
bit about an interesting- We'll come back and take scissors to your

784
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:24,720
carpet here.

785
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,880
Yeah, and we're going to cut the rug here in the studio when we get back, and when we're

786
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,200
done cutting the rug, we'll get into the Orange Launch cage match, so make sure you're in

787
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,000
the chat room so you can vote in tonight's cage match.

788
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,560
And we're going to talk about a really interesting location, probably, dare I say it, the most

789
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,200
interesting place I've ever seen a DDR machine.

790
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,720
And I don't think I've seen a unique thing like this anywhere, so we'll talk about that

791
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,720
when we come back.

792
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,720
I have.

793
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:50,720
Have you?

794
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,080
All right, we'll talk about it when we come back.

795
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:56,780
This break, I think we're going to do some DDR Euro stuff.

796
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:00,940
So let's do some music from- Let's just have some Eurobeat, why not?

797
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:01,940
You want Eurobeat?

798
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:02,940
You want Para Para music this break?

799
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:08,500
for some palapala. Alright, we'll do that. We'll do God. People are going to hate us

800
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:12,880
for this one. Yeah, but Nastila's going to piss his pants. It'll be short and painless

801
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:18,380
you guys. Okay, we'll be back after some quick block of music from Parapara. We'll be back,

802
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,380
Orange Launch Radio.

803
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:53,380
Lost me, lost me, lost my power Turning evil, making evil, surfing forever

804
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:56,380
Clicking evil, cocking evil, starting to get

805
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:59,380
Every single level, play the level, dunking the well

806
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:02,380
And put them to dust during the morning of the night

807
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:05,380
I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire, this is how ya

808
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:08,380
Make a second in your heart

809
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:11,380
I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire, burning wire

810
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:14,380
It's the light of your life

811
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:17,380
Bang bang fire, bang bang fire, bang bang fire

812
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,380
This desire, big obsession in your heart

813
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:23,380
Bang bang fire, bang bang fire, bang bang fire

814
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:26,380
Burning wire, it's all into your life

815
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:41,820
Please don't listen to my word

816
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,820
Don't come too far, don't come now

817
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:15,820
Three, two, one

818
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:29,820
Hurry up, my little guy

819
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:32,820
Everyone is getting all the secrets, baby

820
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,820
Come on, baby, come on, boy

821
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:38,820
Won't you really be the only one here to talk to you?

822
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:12,820
You were saying to me, that fight is a future coming

823
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:16,820
You're all night, about five-two-thousand, come down

824
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,820
Three, two, one

825
01:00:48,820 --> 01:01:09,540
I need to touch a body, touch a body, cause I don't want to talk about it, talk about

826
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:10,540
it now.

827
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:15,540
I need to move my body, move my body, please, don't wait for me, please, please, cause you

828
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:20,540
There's nothing on the night floor I'm looking for a yellow banana door

829
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:23,540
Take me like a sea prune and lay down all your body

830
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:26,540
I'll give you like a tune if the sun comes on down

831
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:29,540
Shake, shake, let me close down my body up

832
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:32,540
Look at the moon, light it all around

833
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:35,540
Time to stay on the night street

834
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:38,540
Light up, take off your suit and dance with me tonight

835
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:41,540
My sweet, my sweet banana

836
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:42,540
Yeah, yeah

837
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:44,540
I think of you every hour

838
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:48,540
My sweet, my sweet banana

839
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:51,540
I wanna dance till the morning, boy

840
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:54,540
My sweet, my sweet banana

841
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:57,540
I wanna feel like your mama

842
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,540
My sweet, oh, sweet banana

843
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:04,540
You know the fruit that I'm not against you

844
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:34,140
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, this is Orange Lounge Radio, welcome back to Orange

845
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:40,500
lounge radio. I believe we've been doing this show what? 66 weeks now. I think that is probably

846
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:44,940
only the second time I can ever remember us doing a para para music break.

847
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:49,480
You know what? I couldn't help it when Eurobeat was on. I found myself starting to do part

848
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:53,140
of that one. That was my first para para.

849
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:56,500
Those songs, by the way, for you guys, Tony and the main band don't know much about the

850
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,780
game. Boom Boom Fire was the first one. That was probably, I think for most of us, the

851
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:05,960
first PAH we learned. Not everybody, but most of us. It was my first PAH. The second one

852
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:14,880
was the club, the one named after the PAH club. Third was Eurobeat, my favorite PAH

853
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:27,400
PAH song, and last was My Sweet Banana, one of Jamie's favorite PAH PAH songs.

854
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,640
Some interesting comments made in the break there.

855
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:35,960
There was one about, I think Rice Princess was talking about how 2DX para para songs

856
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:36,960
are really cool.

857
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,680
They're like some of the better ones, and there needs to be more of them in 2DX.

858
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,520
Like if 2DX just needs more songs, just take some from Parma Para.

859
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:51,200
One of my early six stars was a Pata Pata song, and my first seven star was a Yerby.

860
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,840
Also I believe it was-

861
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:54,840
Actually, my first two sevens.

862
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,080
No, I take them back.

863
01:04:56,080 --> 01:05:01,040
My second three, out of the first three that I passed, the second and third ones, were

864
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,040
Eurobeat.

865
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,040
Sorry.

866
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:06,360
My first one was Please Don't Go.

867
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:10,600
DD Archaholic was saying something about asking, have you ever driven to Eurobeat and Para

868
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,600
Music?

869
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,600
But you know what?

870
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,560
Para Para Paradise was the first soundtrack I ever bought.

871
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,560
I'll admit it.

872
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,680
It was the first Bimani soundtrack I ever bought, was Para Paradise.

873
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:23,160
And driving to that, that's the only time I think I ever hit 90 in my car, and I drive

874
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:25,160
like a grandma, okay?

875
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:30,120
You've been in the car with me with my Eurobeat.

876
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:36,480
I am a very safe, over-safe driver and when I put that CD in, I go like 90 miles an hour.

877
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,640
You've been in the car with me with my Eurobeat.

878
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,880
I don't remember who I was.

879
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:48,440
It was Ryan, somebody said that I get all cool when I drive with Eurobeat.

880
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,320
I was like, what do you mean by cool?

881
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,320
He was like aggressive.

882
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,880
What do you think happened with Parapara?

883
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,800
I want to ask this question to anybody who wants to answer.

884
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,080
What happened with Para Para?

885
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,080
It came out.

886
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:02,200
It was the coolest fucking thing on the block.

887
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,440
Everybody wanted to go to Milpitas Golf Line to play at Para Para because it was like,

888
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,340
oh, it's like DDR but it's your hands.

889
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,160
Then what happened next?

890
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,080
Probably a month later, it didn't come down to about a month later when people were finally

891
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:17,320
realizing oh, there are set dances you're supposed to do to these things.

892
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,760
And then it kind of turned into this big dancing thing.

893
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,100
And I remember there was a time where you could go to a place like Milpitas Golf Line

894
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,020
And there'd be one person up on the machine, there'd be 20

895
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:26,500
people behind him doing the same thing.

896
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,820
And that was the cool thing to do.

897
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:31,020
And then all of a sudden, huge fucking backlash

898
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,060
against Para Para.

899
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:34,900
And then it just became the people who held out versus

900
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:37,340
Para Para Para versus everybody else.

901
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:40,540
And I even admit that I was totally into Para when it

902
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:41,020
first came out.

903
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:41,860
I bought the soundtrack.

904
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:44,140
And then there was just a day when I was finally listening

905
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:46,860
to it going, this all fucking sounds the same.

906
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:47,540
And that was it.

907
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:48,820
I was done with Para Para.

908
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,660
And I think it was about the time it was released for the

909
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:51,540
home version.

910
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:56,220
I taught myself four pa-pa-pa's so I could go to the arcade and blend in with the crew

911
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,220
crowd.

912
01:06:57,220 --> 01:07:01,180
And then I just didn't give a shit anymore and I didn't really care about anything.

913
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:03,500
I remember when RBGL got the pa-pa-pa machine.

914
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:04,500
I remember that too.

915
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:08,380
And there were people who were staring at that scratch in their butts going, ugh, what

916
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:10,100
do we do?

917
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:15,460
And then we got up there and Rick ate the paper that says, do not shadow.

918
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:20,080
Oh yeah, it was great because at Sunnyvale Golf Land, their machine used to have a big

919
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:23,700
sign on it saying do not shadow because if you've been to Sunnyvale Golf Land you can't

920
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:27,040
fucking walk down the aisle if there's anybody standing in it, right?

921
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,720
So you don't want to have people standing there shadowing and it was like this big thing

922
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:33,520
too because Sunnyvale Golf Land is kind of where the backlash sort of began I think.

923
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:37,120
A lot of those people who think they're cooler than everybody else kind of started that whole

924
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:41,880
thing and then they had the big sign on there that said don't shadow.

925
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,660
Well what ended up happening, that machine got moved from Sunnyvale to Roseville Golf

926
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:45,660
Land.

927
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:49,520
The first day it came in one of our regulars over there took the paper off the machine

928
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:53,380
and ate it. It was hilarious and we have a picture of it hanging out of his mouth. Kind

929
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:58,620
of a symbolic thing like, kind of, screw you, we're going to do what we want.

930
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:05,540
And I remember, it would usually be, I'd play, you'd shadow, and someone else would shadow

931
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:12,140
too. One of the people in the shadow. Who else was it? Was it Anita?

932
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:16,260
No, this was when we first knew Anita. I don't remember.

933
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:20,460
So there was a couple of people, just the parents were funny.

934
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:21,440
Oh yeah.

935
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:26,780
They'd be like, huh, we're stupid, what you doing?

936
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:31,560
Some different theories from the chat room as to what happened to Para Para

937
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:32,620
and why it's not cool anymore.

938
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:36,060
Snubdismoid says, I think people saw themselves playing.

939
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,380
That's what it ended.

940
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:42,080
When somebody just saw themselves playing and went, God, I look like an ass.

941
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,440
I don't really care.

942
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:48,080
Stapler X says, looks just like another passing Japanese trend.

943
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,960
I think for me, is I stopped going to RVGL.

944
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,480
That's a big part of it too.

945
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:54,480
I would say...

946
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:55,480
I play when we go to Miggle.

947
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:56,480
You know what?

948
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:57,920
People look stupid when they play DDR too.

949
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:02,520
So I don't know if people seeing themselves playing is necessarily a turn off, because

950
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,000
you look just as stupid playing DDR.

951
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,880
And in fact, like Dance Maniacs, that's the worst.

952
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:08,880
Okay.

953
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:15,520
Okay, I love Dance Maniacs, and you know what, I'm fucking building a Dance Maniacs machine.

954
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:19,400
My machine covers everything, but Dance Maniacs is part of it, so there.

955
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:23,680
I'm just saying, that's cool, I love Dance Maniacs too, but you look like a total boob

956
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:24,680
playing it.

957
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,680
I mean, that's the thing.

958
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:26,680
Hey, Rob?

959
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,680
Yeah, but it's fun, it doesn't matter.

960
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:29,680
What?

961
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,680
You said boob.

962
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,680
I did say boob.

963
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:43,600
Okay, SD Driftking says my DWI is equal to forearm exercise.

964
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,800
You don't want to know what my forearm exercise is.

965
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,840
Moving on to the next topic.

966
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:51,840
Actually, I want to address DDRgolic's idea about what happened.

967
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:55,720
She says, I think what happened is all the haters started being haters and ruined it

968
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:56,720
for everyone.

969
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:03,560
Well, you know what I say, if haters are bothering you, you need to fight hate with hate.

970
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:08,820
stand for that shit. Outnumber them and make fun of them. That is how you're going to stop

971
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:15,540
the haters. You fight hate with hate. We used to fight them with making fun of them. I remember.

972
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:19,460
And it worked. The people that make fun of DDR, we would totally, we would just like,

973
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:23,460
we'd gang up on them, like some kind of geek gang. We'd like all, remember the guy that

974
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:27,020
made fun of me one night playing DDR and then like 10 of us, we all just kind of like jumped

975
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:29,780
him, like sort of thing. We were like, hey, you want to get up there and fight him? You

976
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:35,940
play against him and he ran to the bathroom and cried and you offered to pay for his game and then

977
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:40,900
there's all those other people who i would just have thrown out haha guess what if you're gonna

978
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:50,900
make fun of us then you don't just play anything all right i think it was because you know um

979
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:57,300
submitting you know uh kind of playing pair of pairs kind of like almost just like converting

980
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:03,560
over to being metrosexual. That's why people weren't playing it, because they're afraid

981
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:08,440
of the bright, shiny side, if you would like to call it that.

982
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:11,880
What do you think would happen if you were to show that to the folks from Queer Eye for

983
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:15,780
the Straight Guy? I've never watched that show.

984
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:19,480
Crab people, I think. Even the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy people would go, okay, that

985
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:22,880
is too gay. Get that out of your house. That's too gay. Too gay.

986
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,720
Well, you want to know what, though, before- It's going to be in this house.

987
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:30,880
Before there was a pata pata, though, I don't know if you remember, but there's videos that

988
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,760
I found way back when.

989
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,320
Yeah, the pata videos.

990
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:40,040
No, the ones where they were demoing the game in Japan with the little girls with their

991
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,960
flowery shirts doing the pata pata on the machine.

992
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,820
It's because the little Japanese girls are fucking hot, and they're like, I'll do whatever

993
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:47,820
you want.

994
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:53,220
And then also, the guy got that guy, Bucky, to fucking come over here and just beat ass.

995
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:59,260
If he was the main star of the game, people would be just falling over that game.

996
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:02,660
Jumping backwards a little bit, about three people in the chat room because of the buffer

997
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:06,300
are asking, what is metrosexual?

998
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:11,060
Apparently you haven't watched South Park, but anyway, metrosexual is where you act

999
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:13,140
gay, but you're not gay.

1000
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:18,220
It's kind of like being high in fashion stuff and that type of thing.

1001
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:21,100
Metrosexual is being gay to get chicks.

1002
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:26,380
It's like the thing where five years ago, make fun of gays, can them, all this stuff.

1003
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:27,380
Trust me.

1004
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:30,500
I was afraid to come out for a long time because I didn't want to face this backlash.

1005
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:35,180
Now, five years later, if you're gay, you're cool.

1006
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:40,660
It's like being metrosexual is being one of those guys that's kind of up there going

1007
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:46,780
on a date with some woman at a candlelight dinner, yeah, I blew a guy once, just experimenting,

1008
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:52,940
thing and that's supposed to like make them more attractive you know I think

1009
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:59,820
it's better to be that than manual than manual sexual it's just like that means

1010
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:05,740
yeah anyways it's like you know I think it's just like you know okay define it

1011
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:12,300
manual has to do with using your hands okay it's like it's like you know how

1012
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:16,500
smoking was cool back in the 90s and stuff it's like being gay is cool now

1013
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:22,680
in like the year 2000 and so on. Next year will be like bestiality or something. It's

1014
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:34,080
just it's fads. Hey kids, be cool. Fuck a sheep. All right. Yeah, I know gay people

1015
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:38,040
are cool. Okay, somebody in the town was saying gay people are cool. Leave being gay to the

1016
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:44,080
gay people, okay? We're good at it, okay? Why don't you leave being gay to the gay people

1017
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,760
And like, if you're straight, good for you.

1018
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:49,880
If you're bi, hooray.

1019
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,720
OK, now I'm being corrected on this too.

1020
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:55,720
If it's metrosexual or metrosexual, it's either or.

1021
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:56,800
They mean the same thing.

1022
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,200
People say it either way, because metro, hetero, get it?

1023
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,680
Metro is like city.

1024
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:03,160
Well, right, a metro is kind of what it's supposed to be.

1025
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:06,480
But people say metro, it's kind of formed into that.

1026
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:09,000
Metrosexual.

1027
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,160
They're saying in the chat room, Ben Affleck

1028
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,800
is a perfect definition of a metrosexual.

1029
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:18,740
I would say more like Justin Timberlake is a perfect example of someone who's metrosexual.

1030
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:24,520
He does all these really fucking gay things like being an NSYNC, right?

1031
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:28,600
Yet, he's blinking Britney Spears.

1032
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,600
Not anymore.

1033
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:34,000
Not anymore, but he can say something that 99% of straight guys dream of.

1034
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:40,360
He banged Britney Spears before she went lesbosexual or whatever it's called when a woman goes,

1035
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:46,000
cool to be gay by making out with Madonna. He's like, I was so good she could never have

1036
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:55,920
another man after me. That's why she's gone lesbian and that's even hotter. Anyway, so

1037
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:02,440
the moral of the story is, leave being gay to the gay people. Be accepting, but be straight,

1038
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:07,200
okay? That's all we ask. Going back to my live journal post about national

1039
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:16,520
whatever days. You know what? They need to have National Blowjob Day. They do have all

1040
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:22,000
these sex appreciation day, masturbation day. I'm sure they have a blowjob day somewhere

1041
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,640
on the calendar, Jamie. You just don't have it penciled in. You know what? That's because

1042
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:33,880
they're gross. I will look it up. Loki is going to look up National Blowjob Day for

1043
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:40,800
you all. Okay, let's shift gears a little bit. I want to ask a question to the chat

1044
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,960
room, going back to something actually Bahmani related. Send this to me over private message

1045
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:50,120
by the way, because I'll read these later. I want to hear from people who aren't in Sacramento

1046
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:54,140
first off. Thank you guys for listening, our local friends, but I want to hear from people

1047
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:58,320
outside of Sacramento. I want to hear the strangest place you've ever seen a Bahmani

1048
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:03,380
machine, whether it be DDR or something like that. I want to hear the strangest place you've

1049
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:09,980
ever seen a DDR or some kind of Bimani machine? Because what we found out this week, let's

1050
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:15,940
rewind to Monday, Monday vanilla sky. After vanilla sky was over, lanky style rice princess

1051
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:19,400
and I, we all went to Walmart to do some shopping or at least I was shopping. I wanted to go

1052
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:25,900
buy cheesy poofs basically. So I was going to Walmart to buy some cheesy poofs and hold

1053
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:26,900
on.

1054
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:27,900
October 3rd.

1055
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:30,500
Loki says national blowjob day is October 3rd

1056
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:35,220
It's also national go commando day, so

1057
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:42,540
National blowjob day is October 3rd, so if you missed national blowjob day. I want you to celebrate tonight, okay?

1058
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,500
So here's your chance to make that point

1059
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:52,100
Happy belated anyone to participate with you then get some flexibility all right there you go now

1060
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:54,320
Can I get back on the topic of strange moly machines okay?

1061
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:57,520
So send me a private message, strangest place you've ever seen a Bimani machine, I'm Skye

1062
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:03,160
in the chat room over at www.calibimani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.

1063
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:08,680
The No Skye went to get cheesy poofs and usually, whenever I go to Wal-Mart I can't help but

1064
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:12,160
go into the electronics department because they have cheap electronics.

1065
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:17,440
Cheap mouses, cheap CDs, cheap games, cheap everything because Wal-Mart is the land of

1066
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,440
everything cheap.

1067
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:24,400
But for whatever reason, on this Monday we went to toys and games, we went to stuffed

1068
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,400
animals and things like that.

1069
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,640
We did not go into the electronics department.

1070
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:31,840
Come to find out Tuesday morning, this comes up on the boards at sacramonday.com, hey guys,

1071
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,120
did you hear?

1072
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,960
Walmart got a DDR machine.

1073
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,360
And I'm thinking to myself, no they didn't.

1074
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:41,600
I was just there at the Walmart in Folsom on Monday and there was no DDR machine to

1075
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,600
be found.

1076
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:47,880
Well, it turns out this DDR machine is smack in the middle of the electronics department

1077
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:54,600
at Walmart. Now, most Walmarts, I think, are all laid out the same. For those listening

1078
01:17:54,600 --> 01:18:00,000
internationally, Walmart is this huge chain of stores in the U.S. Big, big, big store

1079
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,560
that sells everything. Most Walmarts, I think, are laid out the same. So like when you walk

1080
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:09,400
in the electronics department, you have your CDs off to one side and then off to the other

1081
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:16,320
side in this Walmart, giant DDR solar machine just standing right there. Fully operational,

1082
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:21,280
It takes 50 cents to play three songs or get three coins or whatever it is.

1083
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:25,400
Now I've heard of a Walmart having a DDR machine out in the front arcade or an arcade on the

1084
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:32,200
side, but I have never heard of a machine anywhere in the middle of a fucking store.

1085
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:35,440
So of course, couldn't resist, had to go play it today.

1086
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:40,520
I had to go rent some errands anywhere at Walmart, so I went to go play the Solar 2000

1087
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:41,520
machine.

1088
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:45,020
And again, I want to state, this isn't like the Walmart and Lodi or other places that

1089
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:48,820
had it in the front, or in a separate arcade.

1090
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:51,900
This Solo 2000 machine is right smack in the middle of the electronics department, so as

1091
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:55,180
everybody's walking by, people can look at it.

1092
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:57,780
The machine is not for sale, they're not trying to sell it.

1093
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:03,060
In fact, they even have a sign on the Solo 2000 machine that says, hey, the Xbox music

1094
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:09,180
game, they changed it, I guess they updated it, but last week it said, hey, the Xbox music

1095
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:12,620
generator's coming out on such and such day, I got nothing to do with you.

1096
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:13,700
They changed it today.

1097
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:18,060
It says Xbox DDR coming out November 18th, right?

1098
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:20,940
Again, says nothing about the PlayStation Max 2.

1099
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:23,820
It says nothing about the already available DDRs out

1100
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:24,540
there on PlayStation.

1101
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:26,500
It's all about promoting the Xbox.

1102
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,900
It's almost like Microsoft bought them that machine and

1103
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:30,500
put it in the store.

1104
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,540
I don't know.

1105
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:33,700
But now we have this DDR solar machine in

1106
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:34,660
the middle of Walmart.

1107
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:36,500
It won't be there for long because the parents will see

1108
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:39,140
the needles and the barely dressed nurse.

1109
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:40,300
That's what I was thinking.

1110
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,340
Walmart.

1111
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:47,200
king of censors. This is the one reason I won't really buy CDs at Wal-Mart. I'll look

1112
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:53,100
and see what's new, but I won't buy, because I fucking hate that Wal-Mart censors the albums.

1113
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:56,780
You go to buy an album at Wal-Mart, and you will buy the desensitized version. Look at

1114
01:19:56,780 --> 01:20:00,300
the fine print, look on the label, and you will see that a CD you're buying at Wal-Mart

1115
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:05,420
is the edited version, meaning they've taken out all the fucks and shits and cop killer

1116
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:12,620
Even a CD like Madonna's American Life that just came out, the Walmart version in track

1117
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:17,580
one, the first song, they took Fuck It out because, oh, heaven forbid, we're going to

1118
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:18,580
hurt our children.

1119
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:21,880
That is so horrible.

1120
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:23,980
I don't think things should be changed like that.

1121
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:26,620
Somebody wants to say fuck, let them say fuck.

1122
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:30,880
Put the sticker on it that says, caution, this CD says fuck on it and then don't let

1123
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:31,880
parents...

1124
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:38,400
That's another case of companies taking responsibility for other people's children.

1125
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,960
Why should Walmart do that?

1126
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:40,960
They shouldn't.

1127
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:45,080
Why don't they just not sell the CD that says, caution, the CD has the word fuck in it.

1128
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:50,660
If the parents don't want the children to listen to something with bad language in it,

1129
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:54,200
they need to freak and police what their children are doing themselves.

1130
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:58,480
Walmart should not have to institute these kinds of policies, but they do because they're

1131
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,680
run by the religious right.

1132
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:05,680
a whole other story. I prefer calling them the religious wrongs.

1133
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:11,640
Anyway, that's a discussion for a whole other show. Yes, thank you. Excellent point by Leadfoot

1134
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:17,280
in the chat room. Yet, they sell rated M games in the gaming section. They'll sell rated

1135
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:21,160
M games, but heaven forbid they sell a CD with the word fuck on it.

1136
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:25,360
It's just a video game, Rob. How bad could it be?

1137
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:29,640
I know. Did you hear about these parents that are suing the makers of Grand Theft Auto because

1138
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:34,140
some people got shot. No, it's not the parents. It's the relatives of the victims who got

1139
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:38,880
shot because some kids went out and imitated Grand Theft Auto. Sue the kids' parents for

1140
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:44,280
being idiots. Yeah, seriously. It's not the game's fault. It's the damned impressionable

1141
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:51,820
people. They're the social sheep of the world. Anyway. They could be just taken off and shot

1142
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:56,620
or something. Anyway, back to DDR before we got off on a little bit of a tan. Back to

1143
01:21:56,620 --> 01:22:00,260
DDR in the middle of Walmart. It's quiet. You can't really hear it unless you're on

1144
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:05,060
it. The pad is so close to the machine that literally I'm 6'2". This is the first time

1145
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:08,920
I've ever played DDR. I have to look down to see the machine. I have to look down to

1146
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:14,760
see the screen. It's really weird. It should be just about right for me. Oh, jazz makes

1147
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:18,900
an excellent point in the chat room. Get up and move is in DDR solo 2000 which has the

1148
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:24,140
word fuck in it. Oh no. I'm going to go there and play get up and move over and over and

1149
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:57,220
I am like Yoshi.

1150
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:59,100
How does that work where they were paying you to play?

1151
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,100
What do they do?

1152
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,100
They're all here.

1153
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,100
We'll give you a hippie sense.

1154
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:05,660
We're supposed to give you a hippie sense so you can play this.

1155
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:08,100
It's just because of people that aren't there paying attention.

1156
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:10,180
There's one nice guy though that's been there the last few times.

1157
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:11,980
He offered to pay for my games.

1158
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:12,980
He did for one of them.

1159
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:13,980
I was like, no, that's cool.

1160
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:14,980
I got the other ones.

1161
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:21,540
I don't want him to just pay me to play the game, but it was all right.

1162
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:23,420
It's kind of cool.

1163
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:27,380
I just don't like their pads because they're like squishy and they hurt my ankles when

1164
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:36,540
you play it with like the wrong kind of shoes, but I think it's kind of cool what they're

1165
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:37,540
doing.

1166
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:41,940
It's just like for some reason, UltraMix is getting a lot of press it seems like for me

1167
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:46,340
because I mean, look at you have the news story, you've got like machines in stores.

1168
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:51,660
It's like that's all your hair runs this goddamn UltraMix, I don't know.

1169
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:54,380
It's like they're really pushing this one.

1170
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:56,900
The Walmartrion, they're dubbing it in the chat room.

1171
01:23:56,900 --> 01:24:01,340
The Walmartrion is located in Folsom, California, on Riley

1172
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:02,340
Street, I think it is.

1173
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:05,260
Yeah, that's where the, you will find a DDR solar machine

1174
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:06,500
in the electronics department.

1175
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:07,820
In other words, way out in the little nowhere.

1176
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:10,180
I want to hear if any other Walmarts are doing this.

1177
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:12,580
So check your local Walmart and let us know if your

1178
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:12,940
Walmart's done this.

1179
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:13,980
Maybe this is the one in Lodi.

1180
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:16,460
Maybe, maybe they moved that one in Lodi, who knows.

1181
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:18,460
Anyway, I want to get back to the question I posed earlier

1182
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:21,020
to the chat room and read their responses here.

1183
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:24,100
We've got a whole bunch, so let's hear about some strange

1184
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:27,740
places, huh?

1185
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:28,980
Let's see.

1186
01:24:34,580 --> 01:24:36,820
Zodiac Knight says, the strangest place you ever saw a

1187
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:40,380
DER machine was at a tri-county flea market.

1188
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:45,500
DER machine and flea market.

1189
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:46,740
The tri-county flea market.

1190
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:52,980
Baca says, strangest place you ever saw a DDR machine was in a pizza parlor.

1191
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:57,860
Well, it's kind of a weird sight at first, but yeah, it's kind of common where we are.

1192
01:24:57,860 --> 01:25:09,480
We see, let's see, Bumlover says, I saw a DDR machine in my butt, wow, that's so mature,

1193
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:12,280
thank you for sharing.

1194
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:17,880
No Stylin says, Walmart once had a Beatmania 5 key before DDR became popular.

1195
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:21,040
That was kind of strange.

1196
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:25,160
Snub Disinoid says, pump it up in the middle of an airport in Brazil.

1197
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:28,020
Listen, like right in the middle of the fucking terminal.

1198
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:29,020
That's kind of cool.

1199
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:34,640
Pump it up machine right in the middle of the Brazil airport.

1200
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:41,840
Jazz kind of cites a pizza parlor as well and the Beatmania in Walmart.

1201
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:45,640
John Field says, a pizza hut, would you like cheese on your

1202
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,520
pads, he says.

1203
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:49,480
So a lot of pizza parlors kind of be in a strange place

1204
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,040
for you to go.

1205
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,640
I think the reason why the pizza parlor thinks.

1206
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,160
I know one, a McDonald's.

1207
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:54,360
I've heard of one being in the McDonald's.

1208
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,400
What, Loki, say that in the?

1209
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,240
A McDonald's.

1210
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,520
Loki says a McDonald's.

1211
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:04,520
There's also, I was told this, there was a BeatMania 6 mix, I

1212
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:08,680
think, in the middle of the mall outside the arcade in

1213
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:11,560
Mobile, which I'm going to actually go see if that

1214
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:13,800
machine is there or not when I'm there?

1215
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:17,840
OK, I'm not even going to read that one,

1216
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,720
because that makes sense.

1217
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,440
I said strange place, see a DDR machine.

1218
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:30,240
Seeing a DDR Extreme machine in the Metreon, says StaplerX.

1219
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:31,320
That's a strange sign.

1220
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:33,240
That is a strange sign, because they held out

1221
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:34,240
for the longest time.

1222
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:40,480
And then says a DDR machine in a bowling alley by my college.

1223
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,420
It's in great shape because no one ever plays it

1224
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:44,860
except the occasional drunken bowler.

1225
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:45,940
There's colleges.

1226
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:48,540
They have a solo basement.

1227
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:54,100
And also, seeing a DDR machine outside of the CBS studios

1228
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:55,660
in New York.

1229
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:58,940
John Fields wants to remind us of that when the CBS Today

1230
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:00,460
show or whatever the hell it's called

1231
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:01,860
did their little thing on location.

1232
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:03,260
And that thing was really stupid.

1233
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,380
Yeah, it was really stupid.

1234
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,900
Tapioca Express, having a DDR machine,

1235
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,100
that was always kind of funny.

1236
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:11,540
one that's nearly dead now.

1237
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:51,300
is at the arcade in the Winchester Mystery House. Really? Yes. I think it was short lived though.

1238
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:56,740
Is this getting off all the ghosts? I don't know. The fact that they have an arcade at

1239
01:27:56,740 --> 01:28:08,740
the Winchester Mystery House is strange enough. I want to go there. Okay, a couple last responses

1240
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:11,140
here, and then we're going to get into the cage match.

1241
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:12,620
Strange DDR machine places.

1242
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:16,740
StaplerX says, one being in San Francisco's Chinatown, just

1243
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:18,700
out in the middle of an alley somewhere.

1244
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:21,380
I remember there supposedly being a Solo 2000 machine

1245
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:23,740
somewhere there, so maybe that's the case.

1246
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:26,860
Or maybe somebody realized Solo 2000 is just kind of old, so

1247
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:28,340
somebody just kind of chucked it in the alley.

1248
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:34,260
And then, oh, a DDR Solo machine in the middle of the

1249
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:35,140
baseball field.

1250
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:39,880
Rayleigh's Field here in Sacramento has a Solo 2000 machine just right there out on

1251
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:45,880
the, what do they call that, the course, the, what the hell do they call that, or the concourse?

1252
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:46,880
Thank you.

1253
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:47,880
The concourse.

1254
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:48,880
The concourse.

1255
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:49,880
Yeah.

1256
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:50,880
All right.

1257
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:51,880
All right.

1258
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:54,000
Let's get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1259
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Whoops.

1260
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Wow.

1261
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:01,600
That was a gay little cage match there for a minute.

1262
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:05,880
Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio cage match was a tie and it came down to Jamie

1263
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:10,160
having to cast a tiebreaker vote via the internet.

1264
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:17,120
And she chose in a tiebreaker above and beyond with a song, Far From In Love.

1265
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:21,440
The way the cage match works, just a reminder, we're going to play three songs for you guys.

1266
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:22,440
You vote for your favorite.

So here's a long clip of above and beyond with the song far from in love tonight's first

1273
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:54,520
pick for the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match.

1274
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:27,520
Like a fire burns in the mood, I know this is where it ends

1275
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:32,520
In the ashes we are dying, I'm a stranger

1276
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:37,520
Only friends fly from the night

1277
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:43,520
From the night

1278
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:52,520
You know I don't know how to feel so far away

1279
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:57,520
Gonna let me in

1280
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:06,520
From all the love inside you

1281
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:13,520
Now I've missed your touch

1282
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:27,520
I've missed your touch

1283
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:34,520
I've missed your touch

1284
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:38,520
I miss you so much

1285
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:42,520
Far from it all

1286
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:46,520
I'm trying to show all the love that is built up inside

1287
01:31:46,520 --> 01:32:10,860
All right, that was song number one, last week's winner, Above and Beyond with Far From

1288
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:11,860
in Love.

1289
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:15,840
All right, second song in tonight's cage match, you get to hear the whole thing and it's kind

1290
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:21,900
a long one but it's Loki's pick and he has picked for you. It's a remix, it's a white

1291
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:27,900
label remix of Broken Wings by Mr. Mr and I guess this one's also by Emotion, it's a

1292
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:33,480
group. It's remixed by a group on the internet, well it's a group of DJs, all women called

1293
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:39,480
the Diva DJs and it's pretty sweet so I just found this today because I was looking for

1294
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:46,480
White Label remixes.

1295
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:16,720
Alright here's song number two in tonight's cage match emotion featuring mr. Mr. With a song called broken wings. Enjoy

We can't just talk to each other's hands

This time might be the last of the year

1304
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:12,480
Listen, make it up to me, I need you so

1305
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:23,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1306
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:29,440
Singing these broken wings.

1307
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,420
Learn the mind.

1308
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:35,940
Learn the lips of freedom.

1309
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:41,940
And when we hear you, the voices sing

1310
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:48,940
The folk of love hang up and let us sing

1311
01:36:48,940 --> 01:36:55,940
Let us see

1312
01:36:55,940 --> 01:37:03,940
Let us see

1313
01:37:03,940 --> 01:37:12,940
Let us see

1314
01:38:12,940 --> 01:38:36,900
We can take what was wrong, and make it right.

1315
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:39,900
Make it right

1316
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:43,900
Yeah

1317
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:47,900
I know I can't

1318
01:38:52,900 --> 01:38:54,900
Baby

1319
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:57,900
Is all I know

1320
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:02,900
That you're half of the flesh

1321
01:39:02,900 --> 01:39:07,900
And love that makes me whole

1322
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:17,900
I need something like you

1323
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:25,900
Hey baby, we're the broken wings

1324
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:32,900
Long live the rest of me

1325
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:36,900
When we meet

1326
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:39,900
But with me

1327
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:43,900
I've got nothing

1328
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:45,900
And I pray

1329
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:50,200
Okay, that was song number two tonight, Emotion, featuring Mr. Mr. with Broken Wings.

1330
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:51,960
Let's go around and see what everybody thought of that.

1331
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:53,960
We'll start off with our guest, Bradley, tonight.

1332
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:58,420
That was okay, I didn't really get into it very much.

1333
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:03,500
I'll give it a seven.

1334
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:10,700
I love the 80s, so it gets a 10, because it's one of my favorite 80s songs.

1335
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:19,700
You know, I love the 80s too, but even the original put me to sleep instead of that one, so it gets a 7.

1336
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:22,700
It wasn't a bad mix, but it was pretty damn repetitive.

1337
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:24,700
I can't find my inhaler.

1338
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:29,700
At 3 minutes in length, that song would have gotten a 10, but at 7 minutes in length, it gets a 7.

1339
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:31,700
I don't know, I can't find my inhaler.

1340
01:41:31,700 --> 01:41:33,700
Alright.

1341
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:39,700
Okay, let's move on to the last song in tonight's cage match, which would be Jamie's pick.

1342
01:41:39,700 --> 01:42:07,100
This song is cool and I had it on repeat 10 times today.

1343
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:10,400
Here's song number three tonight, you can vote for CyberX featuring Rapinoe with Like

1344
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:25,400
a Flower.

1345
01:42:55,400 --> 01:43:00,400
I don't want to die without you

1346
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:31,400
upper

1347
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:32,400
middle

1348
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:33,400
mid

1349
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:34,400
lower

1350
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,400
mid

1351
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:36,400
lower

1352
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:37,400
middle

1353
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:38,400
one

1354
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:39,400
two

1355
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:40,400
three

1356
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:41,400
four

1357
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:42,400
five

1358
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:43,400
six

1359
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:44,400
seven

1360
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:45,400
seven

1361
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:46,400
eight

1362
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:47,400
nine

1363
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:48,400
ten

1364
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,400
nine

1365
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:50,400
nine

1366
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:51,400
ten

1367
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:52,400
nine

1368
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:54,400
one

1369
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:55,400
two

1370
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:56,400
three

1371
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:57,400
four

1372
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:58,400
five

1373
01:43:58,400 --> 01:43:59,400
six

1374
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,400
Oh

1375
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:31,400
Oh

1376
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:31,400
I

1377
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:09,400
I can't wait to see you in the next video!

1378
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:23,400
I can't wait to see you in the next video!

1379
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:30,980
As long as I stay away, don't only lose hope,

1380
01:47:30,980 --> 01:47:43,260
Okay, that was song number three for tonight.

1381
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:47,100
That was CyberX featuring Rapinna with Lil Flower.

1382
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:48,500
Let's go around and see what folks thought of that.

1383
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:52,180
Bradley, you're going to need to grab this mic unless you get up and grab Jamie's.

1384
01:47:52,180 --> 01:47:54,180
What'd you think, Bradley?

1385
01:47:54,180 --> 01:47:55,780
This is okay.

1386
01:47:55,780 --> 01:47:58,700
Her voice sort of got to me a little bit.

1387
01:47:58,700 --> 01:48:03,700
I didn't really like the voice all that much. Wait a second. I'll give it a 6.

1388
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:05,700
Okay. Loki.

1389
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:08,700
This is okay. I'll give it a 6.

1390
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:13,700
I like that way better than the song you picked last week, actually.

1391
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:15,700
Sounds very IU-trans to me, actually.

1392
01:48:15,700 --> 01:48:18,700
I seriously thought I was listening to IU-trans for a minute there.

1393
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:22,700
I seriously would give that a 10, except I think it needs to be a little tighter.

1394
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:25,700
Same problem I had with the last song.

1395
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:31,700
So, I give it like a... I give it a nine. It's not bad. I could stand listening to that.

1396
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:36,700
I think I like best that it kept changing throughout the whole song, all the background did.

1397
01:48:36,700 --> 01:48:43,700
So, I give it a nine and a half. I haven't listened to it all day, so...

1398
01:48:43,700 --> 01:48:47,700
I want a trans version of the Chicken Dance.

1399
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:49,700
You know, I have one.

1400
01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:53,700
I actually, yeah. Haven't you been threatening to put that in for a while now?

1401
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:54,700
Perhaps.

1402
01:48:54,700 --> 01:48:55,700
We'll see.

1403
01:48:55,700 --> 01:49:10,860
Okay, so let's review the three songs you can vote for tonight, shall we?

1404
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:12,420
Let's start off with song number one.

1405
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:17,320
It's last week's winner and the song is called, it's above and beyond with a song called Far

1406
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:20,740
From In Love.

1407
01:49:20,740 --> 01:49:28,920
I don't like that clip.

1408
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:35,720
Song number two you can vote for tonight is Emotion featuring Mr. Mr. with Broken Wings.

1409
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:47,320
Here's a clip of that.

1410
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:51,820
here is song number three you can vote for tonight, which is Cyber X featuring Rupina

1411
01:49:51,820 --> 01:49:54,320
with a song called Little Flower.

1412
01:49:54,320 --> 01:50:07,320
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. My mouse is being over-scented today. Okay, let's try that again.

1413
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:19,320
There you go. There's your three songs you can vote for tonight. Place votes now. Send

1414
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:24,680
a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote and we'll tally up those votes

1415
01:50:24,680 --> 01:50:29,720
and let you know in a little while who won tonight's cage match. Doesn't that sound exciting?

1416
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:35,640
We need to do something else soon too. What's that?

1417
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:42,440
What are we best known for, Rob? Ranting, the FUs of the week? Yeah! We'll do those

1418
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:45,920
in a little bit. We'll do those next break or something. What is Loki whispering to me

1419
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:53,680
here? He's whispering something to me. I'm on top of it. I'm on top of it. I did not

1420
01:50:53,680 --> 01:51:01,520
need to be prompted. While Loki ran off to the bathroom, I was going to have him do a

1421
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:22,680
I don't know that I'll be able to play the show, but I may have some degree of internet

1422
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:25,200
access so at least I'll be in the chat room.

1423
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:29,660
I'll have pre-shows done, I'll have my cage match picks in case, you know, the winner

1424
01:51:29,660 --> 01:51:30,660
don't.

1425
01:51:30,660 --> 01:51:38,420
So, I'll be there in spirit, maybe I'll eat some beef and pee so you can smell my beefy

1426
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:39,420
pee.

1427
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:40,420
Hooray!

1428
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:42,420
For those who were listening in the first hour of the show.

1429
01:51:42,420 --> 01:51:44,060
I said I don't eat beef.

1430
01:51:44,060 --> 01:51:45,060
I'll eat some asparagus.

1431
01:51:45,060 --> 01:51:46,060
Okay.

1432
01:51:46,060 --> 01:51:47,060
It has some really stinky pee.

1433
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:48,060
That'll work.

1434
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:53,660
So, going off, let's plug the spin-off shows, what's going on on the spin-off shows, because

1435
01:51:53,660 --> 01:51:55,980
I want to know what's going to happen in public volume.

1436
01:51:55,980 --> 01:51:58,820
Monday nights on the station, Vanilla Sky.

1437
01:51:58,820 --> 01:52:01,940
Tomorrow night we're going to be talking about some big news in the Final Fantasy world that

1438
01:52:01,940 --> 01:52:02,940
came up this week.

1439
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:07,500
Let's talk about that and Castlevania for review and break down on our thoughts on the

1440
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:14,380
new Castlevania and other stuff that we usually talk about on Vanilla Sky, just randomness.

1441
01:52:14,380 --> 01:52:19,720
As I kind of compare it, it's sort of that Oprah show on Oxygen, the one that's after

1442
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:21,220
the real Oprah show.

1443
01:52:21,220 --> 01:52:22,300
I do not watch Oxygen.

1444
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:29,980
I've just heard about it. I've never heard of it. Oh, forget it. Tell us what's on Tuesday

1445
01:52:29,980 --> 01:52:38,060
nights, Jamie. Pump up the volume. Starting at seven o'clock with the pre-show. I don't

1446
01:52:38,060 --> 01:52:42,460
know what time my show starts. Seven o'clock with the pre-show. 730 starts the show show.

1447
01:52:42,460 --> 01:52:47,380
If you are in the chat room, you can request shit. I'll play it, because I'm nice like

1448
01:52:47,380 --> 01:52:54,100
Although I may be doing requests, I may have to be a little bit more judicious because

1449
01:52:54,100 --> 01:53:05,660
I'm going to be recording this one because it's going to repeat while I'm in Alabama.

1450
01:53:05,660 --> 01:53:10,700
The week after though, I'm doing the show on Monday because I will be on an airplane

1451
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:11,700
on Tuesday.

1452
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:12,700
Right.

1453
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:14,180
So our show will swap next week.

1454
01:53:14,180 --> 01:53:21,940
We're going to swap next week, but I've pre-recorded, I recorded last week's show

1455
01:53:21,940 --> 01:53:23,840
and I'm going to record this week's show again.

1456
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:28,280
And you'll get to hear them if you miss them, which you have no excuse to have missed them.

1457
01:53:29,340 --> 01:53:30,040
I kick you.

1458
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:34,500
It's over at 1030 and you have to be in the chat room or else you miss the full experience.

1459
01:53:34,860 --> 01:53:36,060
That's right, just like with this show.

1460
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:39,920
Anything else to plug with the volume?

1461
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:42,280
Give me drugs.

1462
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:51,280
Okay. Wednesday nights, coming back the week after next, if I'm not mistaken. You gonna be ready for it, Loki? The week after next?

1463
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:53,280
Uh, yeah.

1464
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:55,280
Week after next comes what?

1465
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:57,280
I'll be as ready as I normally am.

1466
01:53:57,280 --> 01:53:59,280
Moving to Wednesdays is?

1467
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:03,280
Is, uh, I'm just kidding. Livewire.

1468
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:07,280
Lesbian hookers in outer space, Loki presents. No.

1469
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:09,280
Ooh. I like that.

1470
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:10,580
I like that.

1471
01:54:10,580 --> 01:54:15,660
Well, change it to bondage lesbian hookers from outer space.

1472
01:54:15,660 --> 01:54:18,900
And what happens on bondage lesbian hookers from outer space?

1473
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:27,260
I play music while bondage lesbian hookers from outer space entertain me.

1474
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:28,500
Sounds good.

1475
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:31,420
November is going to be a big month for the station.

1476
01:54:31,420 --> 01:54:34,100
I swear to God we will have a new website done.

1477
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:35,940
I have so many ideas for the website.

1478
01:54:35,940 --> 01:54:37,580
I want it to be so comprehensive.

1479
01:54:37,580 --> 01:54:39,580
I just fucking suck at designing websites.

1480
01:54:39,580 --> 01:54:41,580
We need pictures first.

1481
01:54:41,580 --> 01:54:42,580
Get the pictures.

1482
01:54:42,580 --> 01:54:43,580
Bust the pictures.

1483
01:54:43,580 --> 01:54:44,580
I want a website.

1484
01:54:44,580 --> 01:54:45,580
I want pictures.

1485
01:54:45,580 --> 01:54:46,580
I want a website.

1486
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:47,580
Website?

1487
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:48,580
No, pictures.

1488
01:54:48,580 --> 01:54:49,580
I'll take pictures right now.

1489
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:51,580
I don't want pictures.

1490
01:54:51,580 --> 01:54:52,580
None of me.

1491
01:54:52,580 --> 01:54:54,580
I'll have to make some for you on Patreon.

1492
01:54:54,580 --> 01:54:59,580
We can just, like, do a picture of, like, some character from, you know, 2DX or something.

1493
01:54:59,580 --> 01:55:00,580
DJ Celica.

1494
01:55:00,580 --> 01:55:01,580
There you go.

1495
01:55:01,580 --> 01:55:04,580
Why don't I just give you all the pictures I made of Dark Sakura?

1496
01:55:04,580 --> 01:55:05,580
No!

1497
01:55:05,580 --> 01:55:15,460
Well, you're going to be the junior senior robot now, so I swear to God we'll have a

1498
01:55:15,460 --> 01:55:18,420
new website this month at some point because I'm sick of the old one.

1499
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:19,980
I want to be the junior senior robot.

1500
01:55:19,980 --> 01:55:22,900
We have a new location for the site that we're going to unveil too and everything.

1501
01:55:22,900 --> 01:55:23,900
It's going to be coming up.

1502
01:55:23,900 --> 01:55:28,380
We have all that and then we have some new specials.

1503
01:55:28,380 --> 01:55:29,380
We're planning for November.

1504
01:55:29,380 --> 01:55:31,180
We're going to be doing some new specials.

1505
01:55:31,180 --> 01:55:35,260
I just got an idea for one today that's going to take a lot of work, but it's going to be

1506
01:55:35,260 --> 01:55:41,380
really fucking cool if I can pull it off. So we're going to do that. Yes. So we're going

1507
01:55:41,380 --> 01:55:46,580
to work on that for November. Also in November, the whole way you hear Orange Lounge Radio

1508
01:55:46,580 --> 01:55:50,060
will probably be changing. We're going to sound even better. Even though you're still

1509
01:55:50,060 --> 01:55:54,300
on the modem line, if you have an MP3 codec, we're going to sound even better. That's coming

1510
01:55:54,300 --> 01:56:01,340
in November. And of course you can't forget episode 69. Episode 69 and unfortunately Jamie

1511
01:56:01,340 --> 01:56:06,620
won't be here for episode 69, but she will be here for episode 70, which I think is what

1512
01:56:06,620 --> 01:56:11,140
I said would be the season four premiere, but I'm not sure. I'm not sure yet. So lots

1513
01:56:11,140 --> 01:56:14,580
of stuff coming to Orange Launch Radio in November, which makes sense because it's November

1514
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:20,660
sweeps. All right. We're going to take a break and I'm going to tally up the votes to the

1515
01:56:20,660 --> 01:56:24,740
cage match. Last call for votes on the Orange Launch cage match, by the way, while we take

1516
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:29,820
this break. The chat room is asking, since we're kind of doing these themed breaks tonight

1517
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:31,000
of a certain Bimani game.

1518
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:35,900
The chat room is begging, please can we do an oha break?

1519
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:40,940
So I'm saying sure, let's do an oha break tonight.

1520
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,740
So we're going to hear the oha ska and we'll hear why,

1521
01:56:43,980 --> 01:56:46,720
the zona song and we'll hear candy.

1522
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:51,700
We'll be back and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1523
01:57:21,700 --> 01:57:27,700
Don't forget to subscribe to this channel and like and share the video

1524
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:29,700
Thank you so much for watching

1525
01:57:29,700 --> 01:57:31,700
I hope you like the video

1526
01:57:31,700 --> 01:57:33,700
I love you

1527
01:57:33,700 --> 01:57:35,700
Thank you so much

1528
01:57:35,700 --> 01:57:37,700
Thank you

1529
01:57:37,700 --> 01:57:39,700
Thank you

1530
01:57:39,700 --> 01:57:41,700
Thank you

1531
01:57:41,700 --> 01:57:43,700
I love you

1532
01:57:43,700 --> 01:57:45,700
Thank you

1533
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:47,700
Thank you

1534
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:49,700
Thank you

1535
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:21,700
Oh

1536
01:59:19,700 --> 01:59:23,700
Don't give it up, don't give it up, you're a star

1537
01:59:49,700 --> 01:59:52,240
La, da.

1538
01:59:52,240 --> 01:59:54,420
La, da, la, la, la.

1539
01:59:57,920 --> 02:00:00,240
La, da.

1540
02:00:00,240 --> 02:00:04,720
La, da, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

1541
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:06,720
Oh

1542
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:31,240
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1543
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:33,240
Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?

1544
02:02:33,240 --> 02:02:35,240
No!

1545
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:37,240
Do we care what people think of us?

1546
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:39,240
No!

1547
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:41,240
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1548
02:02:41,240 --> 02:02:43,240
Yes!

1549
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:51,240
Extreme Bimani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

1550
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:55,240
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, also coming in November. New promos!

1551
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:58,240
We're getting rid of all the old promos, all of them.

1552
02:02:58,240 --> 02:03:02,240
No, we're getting rid of all the old promos and replacing them with new ones.

1553
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:06,240
Okay, well, yeah, the ones with other people in them we'll keep, like Mel and Step Squad.

1554
02:03:06,240 --> 02:03:09,240
But the other ones, forget it, they're gone.

1555
02:03:09,240 --> 02:03:11,240
All right.

1556
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:12,240
Welcome back to the show.

1557
02:03:12,240 --> 02:03:15,240
We'll get into the FUs of the week in a little bit.

1558
02:03:15,240 --> 02:03:19,240
But, Loki, you ran off to the bathroom before I could ask for a Sim update

1559
02:03:19,240 --> 02:03:21,240
and what's going on in the Sim world this week.

1560
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:26,240
And I know there's at least Tourney Mix 4th Plus.

1561
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:34,240
Good God, TourneyMix 4th Plus is going on drei.com, so go there if you really give a shit.

1562
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:40,240
I've lost all hope in TourneyMixes anymore. I really just don't care anymore.

1563
02:03:40,240 --> 02:03:44,240
I don't plan on entering them. I don't really care. I just...

1564
02:03:44,240 --> 02:03:49,240
I haven't played set maybe in months. I'm waiting until my cabinet's done, then I'll play on that.

1565
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:54,240
But, really, I don't like people's sim files anymore.

1566
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:57,240
There's only a few people's sim files that I download anymore,

1567
02:03:57,240 --> 02:03:59,240
and the rest, just fuck it.

1568
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:01,240
I don't even download them anymore.

1569
02:04:01,240 --> 02:04:05,240
And to be honest, the Japanese people make better sim files

1570
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:08,240
than you fucking Americans and Europeans will ever make.

1571
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:09,240
So shut up.

1572
02:04:09,240 --> 02:04:11,240
There's only a few of you that are any good,

1573
02:04:11,240 --> 02:04:14,240
and you know what, and you people know who you are,

1574
02:04:14,240 --> 02:04:17,240
so the hell with all of you, everyone else.

1575
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:22,380
everyone else. There's only like, what? Three people. Okay, let's see. We've got that Matt

1576
02:04:22,380 --> 02:04:30,060
guy. We've got Utterdude. They're awesome. We've got the people at DWI and Sandy. They

1577
02:04:30,060 --> 02:04:34,780
make really awesome sim files. And of course, Healing Vision is part of them. Those are

1578
02:04:34,780 --> 02:04:38,300
the only people that make any good sim files. You know what it is? You know what it is?

1579
02:04:38,300 --> 02:04:42,780
Turning Mix has turned into the new Para Para. When it was first out, everybody thought it

1580
02:04:42,780 --> 02:04:46,260
was cool, and now it's cool to make fun of it. That's what's going on. It's because they

1581
02:04:46,260 --> 02:04:48,220
to keep adding more and more rules to it.

1582
02:04:48,220 --> 02:04:49,580
And it's just retarded.

1583
02:04:49,580 --> 02:04:56,180
But the thing is also, there's another group that was pretty

1584
02:04:56,180 --> 02:04:58,580
good, too, in making sim files.

1585
02:04:58,580 --> 02:04:59,540
I can't remember who they are.

1586
02:04:59,540 --> 02:05:04,580
It's like the DWI New World Order or some

1587
02:05:04,580 --> 02:05:05,540
crap like that.

1588
02:05:05,540 --> 02:05:06,180
That was all right.

1589
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:09,620
But the Japanese people make awesome sim files better than

1590
02:05:09,620 --> 02:05:10,540
you'll ever make.

1591
02:05:10,540 --> 02:05:12,460
And they've been doing it for years.

1592
02:05:12,460 --> 02:05:14,620
So just give up.

1593
02:05:14,620 --> 02:05:16,180
Just stop.

1594
02:05:16,180 --> 02:05:17,420
And that's it.

1595
02:05:20,300 --> 02:05:22,960
Do people still make stuff for BM-98?

1596
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:23,900
Yeah.

1597
02:05:23,900 --> 02:05:26,820
Oh, man, the stuff for BM-98 is awesome.

1598
02:05:26,820 --> 02:05:27,860
I love BM-98.

1599
02:05:27,860 --> 02:05:31,740
I'm sorry, but it takes a lot more talent to create a BMS

1600
02:05:31,740 --> 02:05:38,580
file for BM-98 than it will for StepMania or DWI.

1601
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:39,860
We're talking key sounds.

1602
02:05:39,860 --> 02:05:40,500
They arrange it.

1603
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:42,060
They make their own songs.

1604
02:05:42,060 --> 02:05:45,580
I remember playing BM-98 before I had even seen DDR.

1605
02:05:45,580 --> 02:05:47,760
it's just so much

1606
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:49,780
so is so often

1607
02:05:49,780 --> 02:05:54,060
and you know i'm so sick of hearing about the money where because

1608
02:05:54,060 --> 02:05:56,700
the guys who will be quit making bw eyes

1609
02:05:56,700 --> 02:06:00,860
well here's a girl how many years ago you know i'm going to be prepared to

1610
02:06:00,860 --> 02:06:03,420
look like that being too hard to write

1611
02:06:03,420 --> 02:06:05,580
and yet he keeps making them

1612
02:06:05,580 --> 02:06:06,980
if you're going to quit

1613
02:06:06,980 --> 02:06:07,720
you quit

1614
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:09,300
you don't keep going back

1615
02:06:09,300 --> 02:06:10,340
and equating again

1616
02:06:10,340 --> 02:06:13,140
no one cares you like fighting michael jordan

1617
02:06:13,140 --> 02:06:14,700
and he sucks now

1618
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:18,080
He's the Hulk Hogan of the Bimani world.

1619
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:19,320
It just stopped.

1620
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:21,760
Just stopped making sim files.

1621
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:24,320
But you know, the few people out there that make actual

1622
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:27,840
good sim files, you know, I'm willing to try a few new ones

1623
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:28,760
that new people out.

1624
02:06:28,760 --> 02:06:32,040
But a lot of times, they just suck.

1625
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:35,520
You get one sim file that's a 12-foot rating, and it's just

1626
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:38,280
shit, so whatever.

1627
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:42,680
I just delete the rest and play the few that are good.

1628
02:06:42,680 --> 02:06:47,160
You are no longer after creating the largest step file

1629
02:06:47,160 --> 02:06:49,000
collection on the internet, correct?

1630
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:49,840
I don't care.

1631
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:51,920
It's just I don't really care anymore.

1632
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:56,360
I download one of everything I don't have, but I'm not

1633
02:06:56,360 --> 02:06:59,560
actively pursuing to have a huge collection because I'll

1634
02:06:59,560 --> 02:07:01,720
You're not trying to have the largest step file penis on the

1635
02:07:01,720 --> 02:07:03,360
internet, basically.

1636
02:07:03,360 --> 02:07:05,280
Well, I probably just want to have the best looking.

1637
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:06,640
No, I don't really care anymore.

1638
02:07:06,640 --> 02:07:07,880
Mine just looks nice.

1639
02:07:07,880 --> 02:07:31,880
It's, it's, you know, my penis is quite, quite nice, but, but my Simphon collection, I don't really care, because I don't play it anymore, so, well, not until my cabinet's done, and once that's done, I'll play it again, but, you know, I don't need to sort through, like, 6,000 songs to find something I want to play, because that just takes too long, so, to hell with it.

1640
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:39,880
Oh, and there's some pretty cool skins out there you might want to check out for StepMania Trans Machina, which is a good one I mentioned back a while ago.

1641
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:44,880
You might want to go check that out. I believe it's in the StepMania thread or skinning, you can find it.

1642
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:49,880
And then I'm sure there's been some StepMania updates because DWI Denver updates, so screw that.

1643
02:07:49,880 --> 02:07:57,880
And if you go to, I think it's ddramerica.com or something like that, it's that BitTorrent site I mentioned a few weeks back.

1644
02:07:57,880 --> 02:08:05,720
They have the full set of the Max2USA stuff already done,

1645
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:08,600
which I already downloaded.

1646
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:10,640
I could have done it a long time ago, but I just don't

1647
02:08:10,640 --> 02:08:13,320
care, so there.

1648
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:15,640
All right, that's it.

1649
02:08:15,640 --> 02:08:17,960
That's all that I care about.

1650
02:08:17,960 --> 02:08:22,600
Let's talk about, since it kind of relates to STEP files,

1651
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:25,360
let's talk about this whole Into the Groove thing that's

1652
02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:26,600
coming out here.

1653
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:33,580
can you bring that up for us

1654
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:37,140
yes that's right we're going to talk about Into the Groove tonight

1655
02:08:37,140 --> 02:08:41,660
not the Madonna song but you know

1656
02:08:41,660 --> 02:08:44,860
I'll take an excuse to play Madonna

1657
02:08:44,860 --> 02:08:45,700
a few things

1658
02:08:45,700 --> 02:08:46,780
that are good about this

1659
02:08:46,780 --> 02:08:49,060
first off you've got Keel making some of the music

1660
02:08:49,060 --> 02:08:52,040
alright what the hell is Into the Groove don't tell me what's in it

1661
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:53,300
tell me what the hell is it

1662
02:08:53,300 --> 02:08:54,080
Into the Groove

1663
02:08:54,080 --> 02:08:55,220
is going to be

1664
02:08:55,220 --> 02:09:00,620
a new arcade software, very similar to the DDR, that's supposed to be hitting arcades.

1665
02:09:00,620 --> 02:09:05,660
And it's Linux-based, which whoop-a-dee-doo. But anyways, it's Linux-based, which means

1666
02:09:05,660 --> 02:09:14,480
geeks made it. Big fucking geeks made it. But here's the thing. It's created by Chris

1667
02:09:14,480 --> 02:09:19,540
Danford. He's working on it. He's the guy behind StepMania. So there's a lot of similarities

1668
02:09:19,540 --> 02:09:24,620
to StepMania on there. It's pretty much a lawsuit waiting to happen, but they quote

1669
02:09:24,620 --> 02:09:31,020
that it's, you know, too, it's very different from DDR, but looking at the screen, I have

1670
02:09:31,020 --> 02:09:38,020
to differ. It doesn't look like it's very different at all. And it looks kind of craptastic,

1671
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:42,940
but anyways, they've got some nifty stuff on there, like they've got a mode where you

1672
02:09:42,940 --> 02:09:47,820
can play where there's four arrows, just like DDR, but they're on the four sides of the

1673
02:09:47,820 --> 02:09:51,060
screen, and so the arrows are coming out of the center towards the outside, which is kind

1674
02:09:51,060 --> 02:09:55,020
cool now it's a little different not exactly fun to play but you know it's

1675
02:09:55,020 --> 02:09:59,940
there then they've got you know the normal modifiers like dizzy and sudden

1676
02:09:59,940 --> 02:10:06,260
and expand there are featured in step mania so I don't know and they have like

1677
02:10:06,260 --> 02:10:09,900
some songs on there that are licensed songs supposedly I guess they're getting

1678
02:10:09,900 --> 02:10:14,420
licensing for these I don't think that's gonna happen but whatever that's

1679
02:10:14,420 --> 02:10:19,180
interesting because I see on this sample screenshot they've got atom bomb by fluke

1680
02:10:19,180 --> 02:10:24,940
Which is like that generic trance song that's on every compilation CD ever, but it's a cool song, so whatever

1681
02:10:26,340 --> 02:10:32,400
Baby got Adam ball, and then what Romeo and Juliet I've never heard of a lot of these other songs actually

1682
02:10:33,020 --> 02:10:36,740
Maybe you know these I don't but you said now this is what's interesting

1683
02:10:36,740 --> 02:10:41,180
Is that people in the DDR world are getting into this you said that keel was possibly having licensed songs on it

1684
02:10:41,180 --> 02:10:43,220
Oh, he does and he's like, um, where'd he go?

1685
02:10:43,220 --> 02:10:53,620
I remember when I read this, it says about Rockstar, he's on the staff, he's doing music

1686
02:10:53,620 --> 02:10:59,120
on it, and Chris Danford is doing some other stuff on it, because we play a Keel original

1687
02:10:59,120 --> 02:11:01,580
song on his table, we've actually been playing it for the past two years, I think it's time

1688
02:11:01,580 --> 02:11:08,660
for us to change it, but I'm just saying, he's kind of been known in the Bimani scene

1689
02:11:08,660 --> 02:11:11,980
a little while for making some good originals that would be good for DDR, so it's just kind

1690
02:11:11,980 --> 02:11:14,740
of ironic that this is now going to end up in a DDR style game.

1691
02:11:14,740 --> 02:11:22,540
Well, it's not too surprising because he has some of the songs I believe that are on, I

1692
02:11:22,540 --> 02:11:27,780
want to say they're on that Flash game, that Flash DDR.

1693
02:11:27,780 --> 02:11:31,740
Oh my gods, maybe they'll license Neo Max.

1694
02:11:31,740 --> 02:11:34,740
Oh god, I don't give a shit.

1695
02:11:34,740 --> 02:11:39,260
For those of you that keep telling me that Neo Max is going to be in a DDR mix, shut

1696
02:11:39,260 --> 02:11:40,260
up.

1697
02:11:40,260 --> 02:11:41,260
Just shut up.

1698
02:11:41,260 --> 02:11:42,260
Nobody cares.

1699
02:11:42,260 --> 02:11:44,900
That is like the most overrated thing ever, ever.

1700
02:11:44,900 --> 02:11:49,940
It's more overrated than... I don't know, but just shut up.

1701
02:11:49,940 --> 02:11:51,940
More overrated than max.period.

1702
02:11:51,940 --> 02:11:52,940
Yeah.

1703
02:11:52,940 --> 02:11:53,940
Oh.

1704
02:11:53,940 --> 02:11:54,940
Well, I don't know.

1705
02:11:54,940 --> 02:11:59,860
I actually think I may prefer neo-max to max.period, but fucking, who cares?

1706
02:11:59,860 --> 02:12:07,060
Neo-max will never be on a DDR type machine because they only put good files in DDR.

1707
02:12:07,060 --> 02:12:11,660
OK, once again, this goes back to what I was saying before.

1708
02:12:11,660 --> 02:12:16,100
Why the fuck won't people let me put in a StepMania-based PC

1709
02:12:16,100 --> 02:12:18,340
in a DDR machine, and we'll just do it that way.

1710
02:12:18,340 --> 02:12:20,940
Since most of the DDR machines are violating copyright laws

1711
02:12:20,940 --> 02:12:23,300
anyways because they have licensed music that's out of

1712
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:29,540
this country that don't share the licensing in the US,

1713
02:12:29,540 --> 02:12:32,700
basically, it's like an import CD or whatever.

1714
02:12:32,700 --> 02:12:34,820
So they're pretty much all illegal anyways over here in

1715
02:12:34,820 --> 02:12:35,420
the first place.

1716
02:12:35,420 --> 02:12:38,180
So obviously, Kami's not doing anything about that.

1717
02:12:38,180 --> 02:12:41,380
If we have it in one arcade, and there's bootleg machines

1718
02:12:41,380 --> 02:12:43,340
up the ass that no one's doing anything about.

1719
02:12:43,340 --> 02:12:47,100
So no one's obviously going to give a shit if you put your

1720
02:12:47,100 --> 02:12:49,740
own songs in an arcade machine.

1721
02:12:49,740 --> 02:12:51,140
Except the only people that would bitch about it,

1722
02:12:51,140 --> 02:12:55,780
ironically, are the people that love DDR, which they're

1723
02:12:55,780 --> 02:12:58,180
shooting themselves in the foot, so to speak.

1724
02:12:58,180 --> 02:13:02,580
But I don't understand why they just don't do that.

1725
02:13:02,580 --> 02:13:05,380
In fact, I'm trying to push that on our local arcade here.

1726
02:13:05,380 --> 02:13:07,940
but no one seems to be biting.

1727
02:13:10,940 --> 02:13:13,460
Do you think Konami is going to sue the pants off these people

1728
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:15,580
that put this, if this game ends up in an arcade?

1729
02:13:15,580 --> 02:13:18,540
Do you think Konami is going to sue the pants off them?

1730
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:20,820
Yes, maybe.

1731
02:13:20,820 --> 02:13:22,420
Don't you think that's a little odd?

1732
02:13:22,420 --> 02:13:22,940
I don't know.

1733
02:13:22,940 --> 02:13:23,460
Will they?

1734
02:13:23,460 --> 02:13:25,980
Because the rumor is, now rumor was a while back.

1735
02:13:25,980 --> 02:13:27,220
I don't know if this was true or not.

1736
02:13:27,220 --> 02:13:28,260
I'm saying it's a rumor.

1737
02:13:28,260 --> 02:13:31,780
But rumor was one of the reasons that Konami arcade mix is you

1738
02:13:31,780 --> 02:13:33,820
stopped seeing them is because they ran into trouble

1739
02:13:33,820 --> 02:13:36,820
with the folks that made Pump It Up, some kind of like thing

1740
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:40,020
where Pump It Up got the copyright

1741
02:13:40,020 --> 02:13:43,800
to make dancing machines in the U.S. Yeah, and the Miro,

1742
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:46,260
the folks that made Pump It Up had the copyrights on U.S. machines,

1743
02:13:46,260 --> 02:13:48,120
even though they haven't done shit with it either.

1744
02:13:48,460 --> 02:13:49,660
I mean, God.

1745
02:13:50,620 --> 02:13:54,080
Yeah, but Pump It Up, it's just not as exciting.

1746
02:13:54,080 --> 02:13:55,720
I don't know what Pump It Up is doing wrong.

1747
02:13:55,720 --> 02:13:57,060
I can't put my finger on it.

1748
02:13:57,320 --> 02:13:59,440
It just isn't as good.

1749
02:13:59,440 --> 02:14:04,880
And I'm sorry if you're a fan of Pump It Up, but there's just something about it.

1750
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:07,360
It's just not the same as DDR.

1751
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:09,680
It's not, and it's not the fact that it's five.

1752
02:14:09,680 --> 02:14:13,640
It's just the interface, the giant screen, the songs are subpar.

1753
02:14:13,640 --> 02:14:17,560
I don't know what it is, but Pump It Up is not the same as DDR.

1754
02:14:19,320 --> 02:14:23,920
Anyway, so I think it was something like DDR sued Pump It Up overseas.

1755
02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:27,280
And so Pump It Up got the rights in America and then sued DDR here,

1756
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:28,000
something like that.

1757
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,760
That's the way the rumor went.

1758
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:33,140
So would Konami really have a right to step in and sue?

1759
02:14:33,140 --> 02:14:35,980
Whether you did the step mania machine in some arcade or...

1760
02:14:35,980 --> 02:14:40,240
Look at it, Konami hasn't sued step mania. If I were Konami, if I had written

1761
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:43,640
DDR, I would have sued the pants off of step mania

1762
02:14:43,640 --> 02:14:46,440
years ago.

1763
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:50,120
I was just going to say as far as that lawsuit was concerned, it was

1764
02:14:50,120 --> 02:14:52,940
basically, I think it was overruled.

1765
02:14:52,940 --> 02:14:57,140
That they were considered different, therefore

1766
02:14:57,140 --> 02:15:02,620
I'll find the stuff on it, but I believe that nothing came of it.

1767
02:15:02,620 --> 02:15:13,780
So, basically another frivolous lawsuit that resulted in nothing. Hooray. Hooray for the judicial system.

1768
02:15:13,780 --> 02:15:21,820
I think this is just people responding to Konami's of America's unwillingness to make a new arcade DDR release.

1769
02:15:21,820 --> 02:15:43,820
People want fucking a new DDR mix and I'm just so pissed off with the fact it would be so easy to do. It's so fucking easy to do it and we can actually license the music because there's a loophole because it sort of would fall under the category of a AVM, what was it? It'd sort of fall under the...

1770
02:15:43,820 --> 02:15:50,620
because it's kind of classified as a JewBox. It's a very gray area, but you could license

1771
02:15:50,620 --> 02:15:59,140
it for a flat fee of $364 a month, or not a month, a year. That's change. That's like

1772
02:15:59,140 --> 02:16:04,700
a buck a day. You can't tell me that no one plays that machine, not once a day. Hardware

1773
02:16:04,700 --> 02:16:10,700
would be only a one-time buy of a PC. We wouldn't even really need to do shit to it, and upgrades

1774
02:16:10,700 --> 02:16:13,040
to be free.

1775
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:17,220
I mean, it's money in the bank right there.

1776
02:16:17,220 --> 02:16:18,140
And they're not jumping on it.

1777
02:16:18,140 --> 02:16:22,860
Instead, they're buying $1,500 bootlegs of really shitty,

1778
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:26,840
hacked DDR shit that's not even that good.

1779
02:16:26,840 --> 02:16:29,620
It's just all flawed like hell.

1780
02:16:29,620 --> 02:16:31,260
I don't understand why people aren't jumping on this.

1781
02:16:31,260 --> 02:16:33,420
It can work.

1782
02:16:33,420 --> 02:16:36,940
Like I said, my proposal, I'm going to do the Golf Land.

1783
02:16:36,940 --> 02:16:39,340
I'm going to probably show it to Keith and stuff.

1784
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:42,860
I'm going to redesign StepMania's thing to be just

1785
02:16:42,860 --> 02:16:46,140
like DDR, have skins and everything to make it the most

1786
02:16:46,140 --> 02:16:50,340
convincing arcade port, because it's not some sort of

1787
02:16:50,340 --> 02:16:53,380
hacked shit where it's going to look like crap.

1788
02:16:53,380 --> 02:16:57,260
Really nice steps for songs, full sets of steps, not this

1789
02:16:57,260 --> 02:17:01,660
one difficulty shit, full sets of steps, and all that stuff

1790
02:17:01,660 --> 02:17:02,980
with full unlocks.

1791
02:17:02,980 --> 02:17:05,740
And you can hook it up so it runs off of

1792
02:17:05,740 --> 02:17:07,900
credits from coin slot.

1793
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:13,940
It could work, but people will be like, no, because it's not

1794
02:17:13,940 --> 02:17:14,940
official Konami.

1795
02:17:14,940 --> 02:17:18,060
But people are going to sadly buy this piece of shit machine,

1796
02:17:18,060 --> 02:17:20,860
and you're going to see these in arcades now.

1797
02:17:20,860 --> 02:17:22,940
But to be honest, I don't understand why anyone would

1798
02:17:22,940 --> 02:17:22,940
do that.

1799
02:17:22,940 --> 02:17:23,660
Well, now give it a chance.

1800
02:17:23,660 --> 02:17:24,780
You haven't seen this machine yet.

1801
02:17:24,780 --> 02:17:25,620
It might be pretty cool.

1802
02:17:25,620 --> 02:17:26,060
Fine.

1803
02:17:26,060 --> 02:17:28,620
But still, I don't understand why people aren't jumping at a

1804
02:17:28,620 --> 02:17:31,380
chance to do something like this, because I know Keith, if

1805
02:17:31,380 --> 02:17:33,500
he was still at Scandia, would have jumped on this a long

1806
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:36,700
time, or he would have totally gone with the step mania idea

1807
02:17:36,700 --> 02:17:37,740
for the PC.

1808
02:17:37,740 --> 02:17:39,260
he would have done it.

1809
02:17:39,260 --> 02:17:42,220
If I could find a way to hack the actual disk, he wanted me

1810
02:17:42,220 --> 02:17:46,060
to go ahead and do that and make a mix that way.

1811
02:17:46,060 --> 02:17:48,140
So why not?

1812
02:17:48,140 --> 02:17:50,380
If people can get away with making these shitty bootlegs

1813
02:17:50,380 --> 02:17:54,580
that really look like bootlegs, why not try to make a

1814
02:17:54,580 --> 02:17:58,320
convincing hacked version of DDR?

1815
02:17:58,320 --> 02:17:59,580
Whatever.

1816
02:18:03,060 --> 02:18:03,940
I don't know, what do you think, Jamie?

1817
02:18:03,940 --> 02:18:07,140
Would you play this new mix, this into the groove thing

1818
02:18:07,140 --> 02:18:10,180
that's kind of like DDR, but not really?

1819
02:18:10,180 --> 02:18:12,060
I thought from the first moment I saw it,

1820
02:18:12,060 --> 02:18:13,820
that it looked really stupid.

1821
02:18:13,820 --> 02:18:16,140
So no.

1822
02:18:16,140 --> 02:18:18,300
I mean, if it's actually released, yeah, and it's

1823
02:18:18,300 --> 02:18:20,260
there, yeah, I might give it a try.

1824
02:18:20,260 --> 02:18:23,980
But it just looks really uninteresting.

1825
02:18:23,980 --> 02:18:29,540
I mean, it didn't even look visually appealing.

1826
02:18:29,540 --> 02:18:31,060
Here's my advice.

1827
02:18:31,060 --> 02:18:34,700
If you're going to do this, and you're going to put your

1828
02:18:34,700 --> 02:18:37,020
balls on the line or whatever, and you're going to

1829
02:18:37,020 --> 02:18:41,080
maybe get threatened by Konami. Here is what I have been saying. Konami should be doing

1830
02:18:41,080 --> 02:18:45,700
for the longest time. I bring this up every episode for like the past year. This is what

1831
02:18:45,700 --> 02:18:51,620
I've said. This is how you can avoid the lawsuit and everything. Make DDR competitive. Make

1832
02:18:51,620 --> 02:18:56,540
DDR a competitive game and now it's a completely different kind of game. Steal the dance magic

1833
02:18:56,540 --> 02:19:00,720
mode idea but make it your own. You know, you're doing dance magic without necessarily

1834
02:19:00,720 --> 02:19:05,420
doing dance magic. Don't fuck it up like that one Dreamcast game. What the hell was that

1835
02:19:05,420 --> 02:19:11,420
the one shareware Dreamcast game that we reviewed on the show.

1836
02:19:11,420 --> 02:19:12,420
Eat a Fury!

1837
02:19:12,420 --> 02:19:13,420
Eat a Fury!

1838
02:19:13,420 --> 02:19:14,420
No.

1839
02:19:14,420 --> 02:19:15,420
No.

1840
02:19:15,420 --> 02:19:16,540
That doesn't fucking count.

1841
02:19:16,540 --> 02:19:20,520
Take Dance Magic, make it cool, there you go.

1842
02:19:20,520 --> 02:19:27,860
This is what Konami of Japan, anybody should have done six months ago after Extreme was

1843
02:19:27,860 --> 02:19:30,820
done and they were done with DDR.

1844
02:19:30,820 --> 02:19:34,220
Konami of America should have put out, I don't know what the hell is stopping them, they

1845
02:19:34,220 --> 02:19:37,740
And they should have put out a new American release by now, and this is what's going to

1846
02:19:37,740 --> 02:19:38,740
happen now.

1847
02:19:38,740 --> 02:19:41,060
They're going to go to court and sue these other people, and if these other people play

1848
02:19:41,060 --> 02:19:42,540
their cards right, it's done.

1849
02:19:42,540 --> 02:19:49,560
Konami of America is done in the arcades with DDR.

1850
02:19:49,560 --> 02:19:50,560
But I don't know.

1851
02:19:50,560 --> 02:19:54,500
At the same time, into the groove, it's probably going to suffer from the same thing that Pump

1852
02:19:54,500 --> 02:19:55,500
It Up does.

1853
02:19:55,500 --> 02:19:58,740
It might be the same, but there's going to be something about it that you're just going

1854
02:19:58,740 --> 02:20:01,300
to go, it's not DDR.

1855
02:20:01,300 --> 02:20:02,860
So don't try to be DDR.

1856
02:20:02,860 --> 02:20:09,860
something different. That's why I'm saying go and be more like a competitive game or

1857
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:12,460
come up with something. Think of something we haven't thought of.

1858
02:20:12,460 --> 02:20:17,580
I think if you put me in charge, if it was legit, if I could get the go ahead to do something

1859
02:20:17,580 --> 02:20:24,580
like this, I could make a mix of DDR that would be perfect. The machine would just keep

1860
02:20:24,700 --> 02:20:28,740
going. People would keep playing the same thing. It's just because people get bored

1861
02:20:28,740 --> 02:20:30,820
with the same songs and stuff in there.

1862
02:20:30,820 --> 02:20:34,060
They're bored with, like, I mean, look at DDR Extreme's been out for, like, boy, like

1863
02:20:34,060 --> 02:20:35,060
a year.

1864
02:20:35,060 --> 02:20:36,060
Almost a year.

1865
02:20:36,060 --> 02:20:38,340
You know, and people are bored with it, you know, it's just like...

1866
02:20:38,340 --> 02:20:40,140
Because DDR Extreme was nothing exciting to begin with.

1867
02:20:40,140 --> 02:20:44,180
Half of it, half of the excitement factor was old songs coming back.

1868
02:20:44,180 --> 02:20:48,500
The other half of it was a bunch of Konami songs that have been beaten to death in the

1869
02:20:48,500 --> 02:20:50,580
ground already through other games.

1870
02:20:50,580 --> 02:20:54,460
Only a couple of the Transplant songs, I can think of maybe a couple off the top of my

1871
02:20:54,460 --> 02:20:58,020
head, Gummel and a couple, and just these things that were, like, you know, kind of

1872
02:20:58,020 --> 02:21:01,400
They were lost in other Bomani games that became more popular again with DDR.

1873
02:21:01,400 --> 02:21:06,560
But shit like V and A, they were cool at first, but now those songs are done because we warm

1874
02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:07,720
out with 2DX.

1875
02:21:07,720 --> 02:21:09,880
The dance media licenses were weak.

1876
02:21:09,880 --> 02:21:12,680
They're the weakest they've ever been in a DDR game, ever.

1877
02:21:12,680 --> 02:21:17,940
The U.S. licenses in DDR were better than anything they licensed in Extreme.

1878
02:21:17,940 --> 02:21:24,380
I'm saying right now that pretty much, last thing I heard about DDR was it was an interview

1879
02:21:24,380 --> 02:21:30,500
with Naoki that they did for this last DDR Extreme like party, live party thing that

1880
02:21:30,500 --> 02:21:35,500
they're reporting on on BOMISEL. They had a little thing there on there showing the

1881
02:21:35,500 --> 02:21:39,740
song list where they're talking about. And it sounds like that Naoki is going to be working

1882
02:21:39,740 --> 02:21:46,560
now on Beatmania stuff strictly because they're putting, DDR is not going to, it's either

1883
02:21:46,560 --> 02:21:53,620
done completely as far as arcade and maybe possibly home versions in the Japanese home

1884
02:21:53,620 --> 02:21:56,560
versions, it's either done completely, or they're putting

1885
02:21:56,560 --> 02:21:59,240
it on hiatus for a few years.

1886
02:21:59,240 --> 02:22:00,920
And they're going to come up with something new.

1887
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:06,920
And so people are like, they want more of this stuff.

1888
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:08,880
I mean, you're getting new fans to it, and they're going

1889
02:22:08,880 --> 02:22:10,280
to the arcade and playing it, and they're like, OK,

1890
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:11,480
I'm bored now.

1891
02:22:11,480 --> 02:22:13,640
Maybe it's just different to us here.

1892
02:22:13,640 --> 02:22:17,080
But don't tell me DDR is dying in Japan, because we read it

1893
02:22:17,080 --> 02:22:18,400
here on Monday on Vanilla Sky.

1894
02:22:18,400 --> 02:22:19,040
We read it.

1895
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:21,520
DDR Extreme, one of the top 10 selling games

1896
02:22:21,520 --> 02:22:22,520
in Japan this week.

1897
02:22:22,520 --> 02:22:24,720
Japan, a highly competitive market for video games.

1898
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:26,480
Extreme still lands in the top 10.

1899
02:22:26,480 --> 02:22:28,600
The home version, where DDR fucking sucks at playing.

1900
02:22:28,600 --> 02:22:29,080
Look at 2DX.

1901
02:22:29,080 --> 02:22:30,040
Don't tell me DDR is dying.

1902
02:22:30,040 --> 02:22:30,760
Look at 2DX.

1903
02:22:30,760 --> 02:22:32,840
They're like, oh, well, we need a petition before we release

1904
02:22:32,840 --> 02:22:34,480
another home game.

1905
02:22:34,480 --> 02:22:35,400
What?

1906
02:22:35,400 --> 02:22:36,160
You need another.

1907
02:22:36,160 --> 02:22:37,560
Unheard of here.

1908
02:22:37,560 --> 02:22:40,360
If they tried something like that here, I mean, granted,

1909
02:22:40,360 --> 02:22:41,520
the US isn't Japan.

1910
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:43,800
But if they tried something like that here, they'd get

1911
02:22:43,800 --> 02:22:45,040
laughed out of the country.

1912
02:22:48,440 --> 02:22:52,360
I'm just saying, the only trouble you're going to run

1913
02:22:52,360 --> 02:22:56,920
it to if you run a machine like this is you're gonna get RIA you know well these

1914
02:22:56,920 --> 02:22:59,560
songs aren't licensed or whatever you know that's the only trouble you're

1915
02:22:59,560 --> 02:23:03,560
in rent to konami is not even give a shit about the fact that your machine is

1916
02:23:03,560 --> 02:23:06,220
you know a bootleg or something like that because your machine isn't supposed

1917
02:23:06,220 --> 02:23:09,200
to be over here in the first place cuz you're promoting awareness for the DDR

1918
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:12,300
home versions which is the only thing Konami of America gives a shit about

1919
02:23:12,300 --> 02:23:17,980
right now yeah so I mean DDR Extreme or whatever you know those aren't supposed

1920
02:23:17,980 --> 02:23:20,940
to be over here those aren't licensed for u.s. and this is something this is

1921
02:23:20,940 --> 02:23:25,500
This is the hilarious thing, somebody brought this up, somebody made a damn good point and

1922
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:28,340
of all places DDR freak this week.

1923
02:23:28,340 --> 02:23:36,180
I was reading it and somebody said in the instruction manual to Max2USA it says go play

1924
02:23:36,180 --> 02:23:38,180
DDR in the arcades.

1925
02:23:38,180 --> 02:23:43,660
Says go for the full experience of DDR go play it in the arcades.

1926
02:23:43,660 --> 02:23:45,780
What the fuck are you going to find in the arcades?

1927
02:23:45,780 --> 02:23:49,060
You are not going to find DDR USA anywhere in the arcades anymore.

1928
02:23:49,060 --> 02:23:53,220
Tell me, somebody tell me, in Nortel, where there is more Bahamati machines than anywhere

1929
02:23:53,220 --> 02:23:54,220
else in the nation.

1930
02:23:54,220 --> 02:23:56,860
Make it California, period.

1931
02:23:56,860 --> 02:24:00,760
Can anybody name me three places to have a DDR USA machine?

1932
02:24:00,760 --> 02:24:02,540
Can anybody name me three places to have a DDR USA machine?

1933
02:24:02,540 --> 02:24:04,100
I can't even think of one.

1934
02:24:04,100 --> 02:24:05,100
Maybe the Metreon.

1935
02:24:05,100 --> 02:24:06,100
The Metreon, one.

1936
02:24:06,100 --> 02:24:08,380
You're not going to find one?

1937
02:24:08,380 --> 02:24:11,960
When you're telling people to go out and play DDR in the arcades, you're telling them, go

1938
02:24:11,960 --> 02:24:18,400
and play the machine that says, don't play it because it's illegal outside of Japan.

1939
02:24:18,400 --> 02:24:20,320
It doesn't make sense.

1940
02:24:20,320 --> 02:24:21,880
They're preaching two different things.

1941
02:24:21,880 --> 02:24:24,240
They're like, yeah, this isn't supposed to be over here, but

1942
02:24:24,240 --> 02:24:26,280
it's over here, so whatever.

1943
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:27,240
Go ahead.

1944
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:29,680
I don't think that there's much that they can do as far as

1945
02:24:29,680 --> 02:24:32,480
complaining that there's licensing or whatever as far

1946
02:24:32,480 --> 02:24:34,760
as music goes, because the machines aren't supposed to be

1947
02:24:34,760 --> 02:24:35,640
over here in the first place.

1948
02:24:35,640 --> 02:24:36,600
Music isn't licensed.

1949
02:24:36,600 --> 02:24:38,720
So you would run into that.

1950
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:41,520
This is my own thing, is why DDR USA, they're turning their

1951
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:46,080
back on it, just saying, oh, they're pretending they don't

1952
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:48,160
notice that DDR Extreme exists, because they're not

1953
02:24:48,160 --> 02:24:51,960
having to pay for the licensing and hey all these great songs we're not having to pay

1954
02:24:51,960 --> 02:24:58,160
for and they promote our home releases and if we try to do this the RIAA sucks so fucking

1955
02:24:58,160 --> 02:25:02,240
much that they'd be taking all our money to do these licenses and it's not worth it. It's

1956
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:07,120
not worth it. Have Japan license the songs for us that's I bet you anything that is the

1957
02:25:07,120 --> 02:25:14,080
true reason why Konami of America doesn't they pretend that the importing doesn't exist

1958
02:25:14,080 --> 02:25:16,120
Because then that way, they don't have to worry about

1959
02:25:16,120 --> 02:25:16,680
licensing.

1960
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:18,160
It's all on Japan.

1961
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:20,960
And then if an artist or a record label comes back and

1962
02:25:20,960 --> 02:25:24,680
says, well, I've seen these things all over.

1963
02:25:24,680 --> 02:25:25,820
That's out of our control.

1964
02:25:25,820 --> 02:25:27,160
The Japanese movie, that's out of our control.

1965
02:25:27,160 --> 02:25:28,360
We can't stop them from reporting.

1966
02:25:28,360 --> 02:25:32,480
And to be honest, I think you would get into real trouble if

1967
02:25:32,480 --> 02:25:34,120
you started selling.

1968
02:25:34,120 --> 02:25:36,560
Say I made a new mix.

1969
02:25:36,560 --> 02:25:37,920
We have a new mix.

1970
02:25:37,920 --> 02:25:39,760
I have already a logo done for mine.

1971
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:42,940
It's called DDR EX2, Extreme 2.

1972
02:25:42,940 --> 02:25:46,300
So, say I made this and I went and sold it on the internet.

1973
02:25:46,300 --> 02:25:47,600
That's where you get into trouble because you're

1974
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:50,420
fucking selling a bootleg hacked piece of shit.

1975
02:25:50,420 --> 02:25:55,340
Now, if you're going to run it in one arcade on one machine

1976
02:25:55,340 --> 02:25:57,380
and there's only one place in the world that you can play

1977
02:25:57,380 --> 02:25:59,420
this thing, I don't see what the problem is.

1978
02:25:59,420 --> 02:26:01,180
Because it's not like a big deal.

1979
02:26:01,180 --> 02:26:03,100
It's not like they're losing any money from it since

1980
02:26:03,100 --> 02:26:06,900
they're not making any more upgrades for fucking DDR.

1981
02:26:06,900 --> 02:26:08,020
They've already had their fourth plus.

1982
02:26:08,020 --> 02:26:09,220
It's already made its money back.

1983
02:26:09,220 --> 02:26:12,900
It's just a machine that's going to rot away pretty soon

1984
02:26:12,900 --> 02:26:16,020
unless you put something else in it to get more use out of it.

1985
02:26:16,020 --> 02:26:18,180
I don't see where they're losing any money, because we

1986
02:26:18,180 --> 02:26:20,160
have the latest version there, and they're buying all the

1987
02:26:20,160 --> 02:26:21,540
official ones that come out.

1988
02:26:21,540 --> 02:26:23,820
But they're not releasing anymore, so it's

1989
02:26:23,820 --> 02:26:25,300
just useless software.

1990
02:26:25,300 --> 02:26:28,380
It's like saying I take an arcade cabinet that has an old

1991
02:26:28,380 --> 02:26:30,340
version of Street Fighter in there, and I put

1992
02:26:30,340 --> 02:26:31,260
another game in there.

1993
02:26:31,260 --> 02:26:35,580
It's the same damn thing, as far as I'm concerned.

1994
02:26:35,580 --> 02:26:38,460
So I don't see what the problem is.

1995
02:26:38,460 --> 02:26:46,160
John Fields is giving me a suggestion here about going to DDR Freak and looking at the

1996
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:53,960
California page and finding just how many USA machines are in California. Okay, so 437

1997
02:26:53,960 --> 02:26:58,160
places to play DDR in California per DDR Freak. Let's see how many of those have a USA machine.

1998
02:26:58,160 --> 02:27:09,020
and I just hit cancel. So out of 437 places to play DDR, one, two, three, four, five,

1999
02:27:09,020 --> 02:27:20,580
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,

2000
02:27:20,580 --> 02:27:26,780
eighteen, nineteen, twenty. And most of them are boomers. Most of them are all boomers.

2001
02:27:26,780 --> 02:27:32,860
So 20 locations out of 437.

2002
02:27:32,860 --> 02:27:33,860
5%.

2003
02:27:33,860 --> 02:27:37,420
5% of all places that have DDR, it's a USA machine.

2004
02:27:37,420 --> 02:27:41,220
So if you tell somebody to go out and play DDR,

2005
02:27:41,220 --> 02:27:45,260
95% chance some newbie is going to find is not going to be

2006
02:27:45,260 --> 02:27:46,360
playing a USA machine.

2007
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:48,700
They're not going to be playing a USA-made machine.

2008
02:27:52,740 --> 02:27:53,460
All right.

2009
02:27:53,460 --> 02:27:55,020
Yeah.

2010
02:27:55,020 --> 02:27:56,840
Somebody's arguing how many I count.

2011
02:27:56,840 --> 02:27:58,960
One of the places had two USA machines.

2012
02:27:58,960 --> 02:27:59,880
I only counted it once.

2013
02:27:59,880 --> 02:28:02,920
It doesn't count if they have two USA machines.

2014
02:28:02,920 --> 02:28:05,760
Because really, if you look at it, most places have multiple

2015
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:08,760
machines, they have Extreme and Max2, and forget it.

2016
02:28:08,760 --> 02:28:09,280
Forget it.

2017
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:10,760
Just leave it at that.

2018
02:28:14,800 --> 02:28:16,040
I just don't understand.

2019
02:28:18,400 --> 02:28:20,800
It'd be really easy just to do this.

2020
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:23,360
And as long as people didn't make a big deal about it, I

2021
02:28:23,360 --> 02:28:24,280
don't see the problem is.

2022
02:28:24,280 --> 02:28:26,080
I mean, no, I don't see anyone at Konami going,

2023
02:28:26,080 --> 02:28:29,800
oh my god, there's a bootleg DDR Megamix.

2024
02:28:29,800 --> 02:28:31,800
And they're selling that shit, OK?

2025
02:28:31,800 --> 02:28:34,560
They're selling a bootleg, and no one's coming down on it.

2026
02:28:34,560 --> 02:28:36,200
So I don't think I'm getting it.

2027
02:28:36,200 --> 02:28:38,680
The Megamix we talked about last week with the solid green boxes.

2028
02:28:38,680 --> 02:28:41,000
DDR Megamix, it looks like a piece of fucking shit.

2029
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,440
People are buying it for our $1,500.

2030
02:28:43,440 --> 02:28:46,520
As far as I'm aware, it doesn't have any new songs other than Extreme.

2031
02:28:46,520 --> 02:28:49,480
Well, Extreme had, even though it said it had all the Fourth Mix and all

2032
02:28:49,480 --> 02:28:50,320
that stuff.

2033
02:28:50,320 --> 02:28:54,880
So you're buying a hacked piece of shit and selling on the

2034
02:28:54,880 --> 02:28:57,800
internet on eBay where everyone can see it.

2035
02:28:57,800 --> 02:29:01,440
And Konami's not coming down on them for this shit because

2036
02:29:01,440 --> 02:29:05,360
they don't care because it's not a threat.

2037
02:29:05,360 --> 02:29:09,800
So if I make one machine in California, one machine in the

2038
02:29:09,800 --> 02:29:13,160
fucking world, I don't think it's going to be a threat.

2039
02:29:13,160 --> 02:29:16,880
So they're not going to come down on me.

2040
02:29:16,880 --> 02:29:18,480
Bradley, I've been so rude I haven't let you

2041
02:29:18,480 --> 02:29:19,280
comment on this yet.

2042
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:22,960
Is there anything you wanted to say about the DDR bootleg machine, all that stuff,

2043
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:26,380
if I can untangle the cord from this fucking chair that likes to eat the cords?

2044
02:29:28,220 --> 02:29:28,620
Not really.

2045
02:29:29,460 --> 02:29:30,080
Well, okay.

2046
02:29:30,800 --> 02:29:31,220
All right.

2047
02:29:31,640 --> 02:29:36,080
Jamie, who's back there folding laundry, anything else you want to say on the bootleg machines?

2048
02:29:39,360 --> 02:29:41,700
I really don't have much of a comment on it.

2049
02:29:41,700 --> 02:29:46,480
I just think that, you know, if you look at, and this is honest, this is me,

2050
02:29:46,480 --> 02:29:53,480
If I see a bootleg version on one side and I see an official DDR on the other, I am probably

2051
02:29:53,480 --> 02:29:56,280
90% of the time going to play the original.

2052
02:29:56,280 --> 02:30:03,320
I don't care if it's upgraded extreme or an extreme, I'm probably going to go play the

2053
02:30:03,320 --> 02:30:05,160
extreme machine and that's me.

2054
02:30:05,160 --> 02:30:10,840
But then again, I usually prefer to give my support to Konami instead of, even if it's

2055
02:30:10,840 --> 02:30:16,240
Konami of Japan, instead of somebody's pocket.

2056
02:30:16,240 --> 02:30:19,620
I'm not making a possible that's still another thing I'll still will play the

2057
02:30:19,620 --> 02:30:28,260
original over over the homemade version okay all right break time when we come

2058
02:30:28,260 --> 02:30:31,140
back we're gonna do the F use of the week so send those in over private

2059
02:30:31,140 --> 02:30:35,100
message to sky in the chat room right now this break the theme is going to be

2060
02:30:35,100 --> 02:30:42,100
DDR Euromix songs, the old school Euromix, we will be back.

2061
02:31:05,100 --> 02:31:21,100
And now we meet in an abandoned studio We hear the playback and it seems so long ago

2062
02:31:21,100 --> 02:31:30,100
And you remember the jingles used to go You were the first one

2063
02:31:30,100 --> 02:31:32,100
You were the last one

2064
02:31:32,100 --> 02:31:35,100
Video killed the radio star

2065
02:31:35,100 --> 02:31:39,100
Video killed the radio star

2066
02:31:39,100 --> 02:31:42,100
In my mind and in my car

2067
02:31:42,100 --> 02:31:46,100
We can't rewind, we've gone too far

2068
02:32:06,100 --> 02:32:10,100
Like a tree in the night

2069
02:32:10,100 --> 02:32:19,100
You can't see where we're going No care in the world

2070
02:32:19,100 --> 02:32:26,100
Maybe I'm learning why To see on the side

2071
02:32:26,100 --> 02:32:32,100
There's no way of turning

2072
02:32:32,100 --> 02:32:39,100
You know there's nothing more to this

2073
02:32:41,100 --> 02:32:46,100
Tell me one thing more to this

2074
02:32:46,100 --> 02:32:47,100
Yeah.

2075
02:32:48,100 --> 02:32:52,100
You know that's the thing.

2076
02:32:53,100 --> 02:32:54,100
Ahh.

2077
02:32:56,100 --> 02:32:57,100
Ahh.

2078
02:33:08,100 --> 02:33:10,100
You know that's the thing.

2079
02:33:13,100 --> 02:33:14,100
Ooh.

2080
02:33:14,100 --> 02:33:34,100
More than this, you know there's nothing more than this

2081
02:33:34,100 --> 02:33:40,100
Tell me one day, one day

2082
02:33:40,100 --> 02:33:42,100
There's not a way to go

2083
02:33:42,100 --> 02:33:44,100
There's nothing

2084
02:34:12,100 --> 02:34:28,100
When the rhythm starts to play, I dance when the earth comes and makes me swell.

2085
02:34:28,100 --> 02:34:36,100
Like the lazy ocean at the shore, hold me close, there's way more.

2086
02:34:36,100 --> 02:34:38,800
When the rhythm starts you play

2087
02:34:39,100 --> 02:34:41,100
Yeah, dance with me every time

2088
02:34:41,600 --> 02:34:43,600
It needs a blast

2089
02:34:43,600 --> 02:34:45,960
Like the lazy intern

2090
02:34:46,600 --> 02:34:51,300
Hold me close, I can't hear you more

2091
02:34:51,300 --> 02:34:53,600
When the rhythm starts you play

2092
02:34:53,600 --> 02:34:56,400
Yeah, dance with me every time

2093
02:34:56,600 --> 02:34:58,400
It needs a blast

2094
02:34:58,400 --> 02:35:00,600
Like the lazy intern

2095
02:35:00,600 --> 02:35:06,820
10

2096
02:35:06,820 --> 02:35:11,780
2

2097
02:35:11,780 --> 02:35:15,500
3

2098
02:35:15,500 --> 02:35:19,200
2

2099
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:22,960
1

2100
02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:26,600
playing

2101
02:35:26,600 --> 02:35:31,600
Orange Lounge Radio. If we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

2102
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:41,600
Hello, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 66 in progress.

2103
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:48,600
After a little bit of a heated discussion about the bootleg machines versus the normal machines and da-da-da-da-da.

2104
02:35:48,600 --> 02:35:51,600
I want to respond to a comment that came into the chat room while we were on break there.

2105
02:35:51,600 --> 02:35:57,380
One of our new listeners, hello, wampa164, had a kind of a statement.

2106
02:35:57,380 --> 02:36:01,260
What I like this, how you said that to the people, designing the DDR clone, running on

2107
02:36:01,260 --> 02:36:06,980
Linux, we're huge fucking nerds, yet you're running a radio show that talks about DDR.

2108
02:36:06,980 --> 02:36:12,300
Okay, it's a joke, I'm, you know, we're just, it's a joke.

2109
02:36:12,300 --> 02:36:17,260
We make the joke, haha, Linux is a nerdy thing because most, you know, Joe Schmoe's run Windows

2110
02:36:17,260 --> 02:36:21,080
95 and all that stuff and the easier run stuff, so, you know, if it's programmed in Linux,

2111
02:36:21,080 --> 02:36:26,400
must be a nerdy thing. We realize we're big geeks and dorks. I take great pride in being

2112
02:36:26,400 --> 02:36:29,960
a dork. There's nothing wrong with it. So there's nothing wrong with coding stuff in

2113
02:36:29,960 --> 02:36:35,240
Linux either. It's just a joke. So please, don't take it too seriously, okay? Hello,

2114
02:36:35,240 --> 02:36:41,800
I'm making a fucking arcade cabinet for the house. I mean, how much more nerdy can you

2115
02:36:41,800 --> 02:36:49,000
get? Okay. Second off, I want to respond to, kind of like, you know, that we get into like

2116
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:53,480
these big heated arguments of over DDR over like how it is kind of just more

2117
02:36:53,480 --> 02:36:58,680
like a general kind of vibe I feel in the air this why why we get so

2118
02:36:58,680 --> 02:37:03,920
passionate about DDR and stuff look how much this game has changed our lives

2119
02:37:03,920 --> 02:37:08,000
look how much money this game is taken look how much money this games taken

2120
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:12,880
from us look how much weight I've lost playing it but look I would not be

2121
02:37:12,880 --> 02:37:18,440
living in this apartment with Loki if it were not for DDR I would not have Jamie

2122
02:37:18,440 --> 02:37:23,520
me as one of my best friends if it were not for DDR. I would never have gotten Bradley

2123
02:37:23,520 --> 02:37:26,040
to ever say a word nor met him if it had not been for DDR.

2124
02:37:26,040 --> 02:37:36,240
You know what? I met Bradley at AX playing DDR. Out of the Expo 2000, wasn't it? So yeah.

2125
02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:43,720
He was that quiet guy standing there. Meanwhile, I'm over there in my Joe costume singing Xanadu.

2126
02:37:43,720 --> 02:37:48,240
So basically the point I want to make, DDR is obviously, if we've gone to the extent

2127
02:37:48,240 --> 02:37:53,000
to make a show near and dear to our hearts, so we put a lot of fucking effort into, despite

2128
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,920
what you may think, because our website's out of date and all that stuff, we put a lot

2129
02:37:55,920 --> 02:37:59,640
of fucking effort into this station that nobody listens to.

2130
02:37:59,640 --> 02:38:04,320
But we do it anyway because it's fun.

2131
02:38:04,320 --> 02:38:07,800
When we have all these, so obviously we have some very strong opinions about DDR.

2132
02:38:07,800 --> 02:38:13,000
And when DDR starts to go in a direction that we don't like, we not get a little bit.

2133
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:16,380
It's just like when Star Wars fans call Lucas an asshole because he does something they

2134
02:38:16,380 --> 02:38:17,380
don't like.

2135
02:38:17,380 --> 02:38:20,220
Obviously, when all is said and done, we fucking love Konami.

2136
02:38:20,220 --> 02:38:23,540
Excuse me, there's a difference between Konami doing something we don't like and what Lucas

2137
02:38:23,540 --> 02:38:24,540
did.

2138
02:38:24,540 --> 02:38:26,060
Okay, I'm just trying to make a broad comparison.

2139
02:38:26,060 --> 02:38:28,140
Obviously, we fucking love Konami.

2140
02:38:28,140 --> 02:38:31,100
If it were not for Konami, we wouldn't have DDR, we wouldn't have all this great music.

2141
02:38:31,100 --> 02:38:34,980
Konami Originals is some of the best music in DDR, but when they make bad decisions,

2142
02:38:34,980 --> 02:38:39,820
we're going to call them on it because they're affecting a game that means a lot to us.

2143
02:38:39,820 --> 02:38:41,740
So that's kind of the purpose behind this show.

2144
02:38:41,740 --> 02:38:50,220
We slam DDR a lot on this show, but when all is said and done, we're only pointing out

2145
02:38:50,220 --> 02:38:54,460
the flaws we see because the game means so much to us in the end.

2146
02:38:54,460 --> 02:38:55,460
Okay.

2147
02:38:55,460 --> 02:38:58,700
Let's see, what was the other comment?

2148
02:38:58,700 --> 02:39:02,300
I want to be fair and kind of give the whole comments here.

2149
02:39:02,300 --> 02:39:04,740
Some people commented that Konami doesn't care.

2150
02:39:04,740 --> 02:39:09,180
Romani went to pretty good lengths to listen to what the Konami community wanted with the

2151
02:39:09,180 --> 02:39:13,300
public beta test and the poll they made to see that people wanted back, which might be

2152
02:39:13,300 --> 02:39:16,820
primarily responsible for seeing Rhythm Police again on a mix. Hey, if you listened to the

2153
02:39:16,820 --> 02:39:23,020
show a couple weeks ago, I said Max 2 has the best licenses. They did listen to what

2154
02:39:23,020 --> 02:39:26,700
the people want. People said We Want Heaven by DJ Yano. They put it on there. It's a pretty

2155
02:39:26,700 --> 02:39:33,880
sweet song. So, you know, Konami of America doesn't completely fuck up one after another

2156
02:39:33,880 --> 02:39:38,800
time. But it's just kind of like what's frustrating sometimes is that Konami, when they do things,

2157
02:39:38,800 --> 02:39:41,440
They do it so well. Why won't they keep doing it?

2158
02:39:42,680 --> 02:39:45,160
Why won't they make new mixes? Okay. Here's what?

2159
02:39:47,240 --> 02:39:48,360
What

2160
02:39:48,360 --> 02:39:55,120
What do you think I said? Okay. Here's what I don't understand. Okay, the whole the whole thing of DDR3 mode is like, yes

2161
02:39:55,120 --> 02:39:59,320
They're going in the right direction. You know, they're they're getting input from the fans. No

2162
02:40:00,600 --> 02:40:02,600
Come in

2163
02:40:02,600 --> 02:40:09,600
Hello. Hi. Okay. So they're getting input from the fans and everything and they're like,

2164
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:13,600
oh yeah, we're starting over. We're doing this. And they're like, ha, no we're not.

2165
02:40:13,600 --> 02:40:18,280
It's like giving the players blue balls. That's pretty much what it is. It's like you're getting

2166
02:40:18,280 --> 02:40:21,880
them all psyched up for like this new thing. They're just going to keep going. Then they're

2167
02:40:21,880 --> 02:40:27,800
like, no, we changed their minds. We don't really want to do that anymore. It's just

2168
02:40:27,800 --> 02:40:36,680
are really annoying. They frustrate the players. All right. So, bottom line. Look at us. We're

2169
02:40:36,680 --> 02:40:41,760
dorks. We don't care. Yes, we have a radio station dedicated to DDR and you know what?

2170
02:40:41,760 --> 02:40:45,680
We like it that way because DDR has affected our lives so much. We feel the need to talk

2171
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:50,960
about it three hours a week, in some cases more with our spinoff shows. So when DDR does

2172
02:40:50,960 --> 02:40:56,080
something we don't like, we're going to point it out. End of story. And we're going to give

2173
02:40:56,080 --> 02:41:01,520
our kind suggestions in a comical way, because this is radio, and we want you people to have

2174
02:41:01,520 --> 02:41:06,040
something to listen to. If we were just sitting here, well, I see that we're going to have

2175
02:41:06,040 --> 02:41:10,900
the new Max 2 out in a couple months, and it would be boring. So obviously we've got

2176
02:41:10,900 --> 02:41:13,160
to say things that are going to piss people off, because that's what radio is all about.

2177
02:41:13,160 --> 02:41:15,760
It would be like watching Masterpiece Theater.

2178
02:41:15,760 --> 02:41:21,300
Exactly. All right. I think we're done. But you know what? I welcome the counter opinions.

2179
02:41:21,300 --> 02:41:25,160
I welcome that. So I don't want to sound like I'm singling a person out or yelling at somebody,

2180
02:41:25,160 --> 02:41:30,980
because I welcome the other opinions. It's kind of fun. We just filled up a good 10 minutes

2181
02:41:30,980 --> 02:41:37,400
right there. All right. Let's completely change topics and let's stop saying F-you to Bamani

2182
02:41:37,400 --> 02:41:41,840
for a little bit. Oh, I have announced the winner of the Orange Lounge Cage Match. Holy

2183
02:41:41,840 --> 02:41:46,680
Christ. We got so much on another tangent here that we didn't ever even announce the

2184
02:41:46,680 --> 02:41:50,240
winner of the Orange Lounge Cage Match. Here it is, tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge

2185
02:41:50,240 --> 02:41:55,980
cage match by quite a large margin, I must say, is coming from a person who I don't think

2186
02:41:55,980 --> 02:41:57,880
has won the cage match in a while, Jamie.

2187
02:41:57,880 --> 02:41:58,880
Your song won tonight.

2188
02:41:58,880 --> 02:41:59,880
Yay.

2189
02:41:59,880 --> 02:42:00,880
Good job.

2190
02:42:00,880 --> 02:42:01,880
Cyber X with Little Flower.

2191
02:42:01,880 --> 02:42:02,880
Thank you.

2192
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:03,880
Thank you.

2193
02:42:03,880 --> 02:42:04,880
You love me.

2194
02:42:04,880 --> 02:42:05,880
You all really love me.

2195
02:42:05,880 --> 02:42:08,580
I feel like going ferret squee.

2196
02:42:08,580 --> 02:42:09,580
So that's good.

2197
02:42:09,580 --> 02:42:10,580
It's a good song.

2198
02:42:10,580 --> 02:42:11,580
I'm glad it won.

2199
02:42:11,580 --> 02:42:12,580
All right.

2200
02:42:12,580 --> 02:42:13,580
Cool.

2201
02:42:13,580 --> 02:42:14,580
So there's your winner for tonight's cage match.

2202
02:42:14,580 --> 02:42:15,580
Sorry I didn't announce it earlier.

2203
02:42:15,580 --> 02:42:16,580
We got kind of sidetracked.

2204
02:42:16,580 --> 02:42:17,580
Woo hoo.

2205
02:42:17,580 --> 02:42:18,580
Okay.

2206
02:42:18,580 --> 02:42:19,580
That means I don't have to pick a song next week.

2207
02:42:19,580 --> 02:42:22,060
There you go, there you go.

2208
02:42:22,060 --> 02:42:27,140
We're going to get into the FUs of the Week, so we're going to stop saying FU to Bomani and we'll say FU to some other stuff real fast.

2209
02:42:27,140 --> 02:42:31,520
So, Jamie, why don't you explain the FUs of the Week for those people who haven't listened before.

2210
02:42:31,520 --> 02:42:38,520
This is where we get really pissed off and tell you about it.

2211
02:42:52,360 --> 02:42:53,700
Um, first

2212
02:42:53,700 --> 02:42:56,940
after he goes to my cough that will never go away

2213
02:42:56,940 --> 02:42:59,080
I feel like I've been cursed

2214
02:42:59,080 --> 02:43:09,040
So fuck my lungs and my nose for being trippy, although I really do like coding a whole lot.

2215
02:43:09,040 --> 02:43:17,200
Another F.U. goes to being sick at work and then another F.U. goes toward the attitude

2216
02:43:17,200 --> 02:43:21,200
of some of my co-workers that I'm contagious, which is absolute bullshit because it's just

2217
02:43:21,200 --> 02:43:24,800
a sinus infection, which is bacteria.

2218
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:30,100
If you're going to get a fine of infection, you're going to get it.

2219
02:43:30,100 --> 02:43:35,700
Another one goes toward not having any PTO left over after my trip from Alabama because

2220
02:43:35,700 --> 02:43:42,500
I had to use half of what would have been my remainder going to the doctor.

2221
02:43:42,500 --> 02:43:46,300
Another one goes toward my car still not being done yet, although they're making progress

2222
02:43:46,300 --> 02:43:48,300
on it.

2223
02:43:48,300 --> 02:43:58,300
The biggest one right now is this headache that just won't go away, so yeah, I'm done.

2224
02:43:58,300 --> 02:44:00,300
Wow, that was pretty quick.

2225
02:44:00,300 --> 02:44:03,300
That's because I'm in pain.

2226
02:44:03,300 --> 02:44:09,300
Next up, Loki.

2227
02:44:09,300 --> 02:44:13,300
I'm eating spaghetti, dry spaghetti.

2228
02:44:13,300 --> 02:44:25,300
Anyways, um, I view the stupid drivers because you go too damn slow, especially when I have to yell at you and you don't hear me. That pisses me off too.

2229
02:44:25,300 --> 02:44:33,300
So of course I should guess that you wouldn't hear me since my windows are down. But you should! You should see me angry and move out of my way.

2230
02:44:33,300 --> 02:44:44,300
FU to Walmart for having a solo 2000 because solo sucks, so you suck.

2231
02:44:44,300 --> 02:44:56,020
And FU to the DVD video that I had for calibrating my TV, it's very boring, so yeah, that sucks.

2232
02:44:56,020 --> 02:45:02,300
I expect it to be exciting, exciting.

2233
02:45:02,300 --> 02:45:07,300
In defense of that video, it did have the electrocution and the pyromaniacal arm.

2234
02:45:08,300 --> 02:45:10,300
Okay, that was funny.

2235
02:45:10,300 --> 02:45:15,300
F you to Rob for encouraging the old Chinese lady for giving people out samples.

2236
02:45:15,300 --> 02:45:18,300
I had her trained really well. She wasn't going to give me a sample.

2237
02:45:18,300 --> 02:45:20,300
You're the fucking go and ask for a sample.

2238
02:45:20,300 --> 02:45:21,300
God damn it.

2239
02:45:21,300 --> 02:45:22,300
What sample?

2240
02:45:22,300 --> 02:45:38,300
F.U. the fact that we have to do these on Sunday because I'm more violent on Mondays when I'm pissed off at things, but now I calm down by the weekend. It's just not fair.

2241
02:45:38,300 --> 02:45:44,300
I don't have much more to complain about.

2242
02:45:44,300 --> 02:45:51,300
Oh yeah, F you to stupid high school whores because you suck and we know that you're going

2243
02:45:51,300 --> 02:45:56,020
to get knocked open pregnant and have some STD and then like collect welfare so you suck

2244
02:45:56,020 --> 02:45:57,020
in advance.

2245
02:45:57,020 --> 02:45:58,020
I'm done.

2246
02:45:58,020 --> 02:45:59,020
Alright.

2247
02:45:59,020 --> 02:46:09,020
I would have to say I give an F you to this fucking driver who as I was you

2248
02:46:09,020 --> 02:46:12,580
know I hate it when people as you're driving down the street they have to

2249
02:46:12,580 --> 02:46:16,940
pull out of a lot right in front of you so you have to step on the brakes that

2250
02:46:16,940 --> 02:46:21,380
is so fucked up when I have to slow down because you're an asshole and you can't

2251
02:46:21,380 --> 02:46:30,220
both ways before you pull out of the parking lot. Fuck you! And I'm continuing FU to Comcast's

2252
02:46:30,220 --> 02:46:33,500
worst cable company on the face of the Earth. Now they're fucking over a bunch of my friends.

2253
02:46:33,500 --> 02:46:37,020
I've been reading a LiveJournal this week. Comcast has been taking people offline and

2254
02:46:37,020 --> 02:46:43,300
all this stuff. And worse yet, it's spreading. It's worse than Gator. It's spreading like

2255
02:46:43,300 --> 02:46:49,960
a disease. Oh, now it reminds me, FU to Lop.com, I'll let Loky give the rest of this. Lop.com

2256
02:47:19,960 --> 02:47:24,960
Find the hidden link on there and then download their uninstall program and run it.

2257
02:47:24,960 --> 02:47:26,960
It has the only way.

2258
02:47:26,960 --> 02:47:29,960
Also, avoid the program No Adware.

2259
02:47:29,960 --> 02:47:32,960
It's like called No Adware or something like that.

2260
02:47:32,960 --> 02:47:35,960
It is Adware itself.

2261
02:47:35,960 --> 02:47:36,960
Irony.

2262
02:47:36,960 --> 02:47:39,960
I still vouch for the Seek and Destroy program.

2263
02:47:39,960 --> 02:47:40,960
That's a good one.

2264
02:47:40,960 --> 02:47:43,960
I've been using Adware as well, too.

2265
02:47:43,960 --> 02:47:54,960
I have to use Attaware and then this one program called, oh I forget what it is, I stick with,

2266
02:47:54,960 --> 02:47:59,120
I have about three different pop-up programs running at the same time to avoid any pop-ups

2267
02:47:59,120 --> 02:48:03,000
and get some, still sneak through, so.

2268
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,560
I'll tell you what, it's all about Mozilla.

2269
02:48:05,560 --> 02:48:10,400
If it weren't slow as shit, Mozilla would be the best because you can block, the pop-up

2270
02:48:10,400 --> 02:48:24,960
I have found though that I haven't had nearly as much crap get on my computer since I've

2271
02:48:24,960 --> 02:48:30,600
been using the Google companion on Internet Explorer.

2272
02:48:30,600 --> 02:48:37,000
It has the search engine, the pop-up blocker, and an individual word search by every title

2273
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:38,480
that you've put in there.

2274
02:48:38,480 --> 02:48:47,480
It's a very, very intelligent little companion, and it effectively blocks just about any pop-up that'll come through and anything that tries to install on your computer.

2275
02:48:47,480 --> 02:48:53,480
It's very effective, so I recommend it. You can get it right on Google.com.

2276
02:48:53,480 --> 02:48:57,480
Okay. Bradley, you have any FUs you want to give tonight?

2277
02:48:57,480 --> 02:49:03,480
Oh, sure, sure. Fuck you to not having money, because that's why CalMPS had to take my stuff away.

2278
02:49:03,480 --> 02:49:13,480
He actually had options for paying like 90 bucks or something, but I have like two payments on Monday that I just barely can cover, so I had to let him take it away.

2279
02:49:13,480 --> 02:49:25,480
And it'll take me like two months to get it back if I can ever get to that. But anyway, and fuck you to not having money because there's Papa John's pizza ad right in front of me and it makes me hungry for it, but I can't really afford it.

2280
02:49:25,480 --> 02:49:29,480
He can turn it over if it helps.

2281
02:49:29,480 --> 02:49:31,480
Are you gonna buy Bradley pizza?

2282
02:49:31,480 --> 02:49:33,480
I got Bradley pizza one day.

2283
02:50:01,480 --> 02:50:08,480
I try, I try not, I make it sometimes but I don't, I don't tell people about it.

2284
02:50:08,480 --> 02:50:11,480
Just, he's trying to be funny and he's not, just ignore it.

2285
02:50:11,480 --> 02:50:14,480
Yeah, well he, he's trying to be funny.

2286
02:50:14,480 --> 02:50:17,480
He'll be funny if he does it in Portuguese.

2287
02:50:17,480 --> 02:50:20,480
Miserably, miserably, terrible, horrible, he'll be very bad.

2288
02:50:20,480 --> 02:50:26,480
And, ok, uh, and fuck you to that, cause then, then we're supposed to have like this, and then,

2289
02:50:26,480 --> 02:50:33,480
And then she said, oh, so I messed it up, so I'll have like 11 AM on Thursday.

2290
02:50:33,480 --> 02:50:42,480
And so then I think she called me at 11 AM her time, because I wasn't running at that time, but I couldn't get to it.

2291
02:50:42,480 --> 02:50:51,480
And then now fuck you to Mailsweeper, because her company uses that, and it started thinking my emails were spam.

2292
02:50:51,480 --> 02:51:01,480
So I tried like four or five different times to get through, and I kept from blocking him, so I still needed a caller to make sure that my last message got through, which didn't seem to be blocked.

2293
02:51:01,480 --> 02:51:11,480
And hopefully it'll actually work out and actually talk to the person, and then they can reject me for not being full of the customer service skills that they probably want.

2294
02:51:11,480 --> 02:51:15,480
Uh, let's see, what else? Anything else?

2295
02:51:15,480 --> 02:51:18,480
Uh, fuck you, the chairs that make too much noise.

2296
02:51:18,480 --> 02:51:25,480
Because, like, these hydraulic chairs, they're quite the first, and then they start making noise on me for some reason.

2297
02:51:25,480 --> 02:51:32,480
And... and I'll wrap it up so people can get to the set room and finish it up.

2298
02:51:32,480 --> 02:51:33,480
That's it then?

2299
02:51:33,480 --> 02:51:34,480
Yeah.

2300
02:51:34,480 --> 02:51:40,480
Alright. Let's move on to the chat room FUs, and fuckin' hey, there's a lot of them tonight.

2301
02:51:40,480 --> 02:51:44,680
No Silence says, my F.U. of the week is those people that think they're cars, you know those

2302
02:51:44,680 --> 02:51:48,000
people that ride the scooters and the motor ones, they get in front of you thinking they

2303
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:49,000
belong there.

2304
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:52,360
I go, get out of my way, you're not a bike, so go on the sidewalk.

2305
02:51:52,360 --> 02:51:55,700
My next F.U. of the week is for my car not being fixed, again.

2306
02:51:55,700 --> 02:51:58,960
My next F.U. of the week is spending over $100 for art supplies, again.

2307
02:51:58,960 --> 02:52:01,880
F.U. for running out of ideas, I need more ideas.

2308
02:52:01,880 --> 02:52:03,880
God I'm sick.

2309
02:52:03,880 --> 02:52:10,880
They got cut off. God, I'm sick.

2310
02:52:11,480 --> 02:52:13,380
EvilNauke2Dx says,

2311
02:52:13,380 --> 02:52:19,640
My only F.U. this week is homework, and hi Nee-chan.

2312
02:52:19,640 --> 02:52:20,880
Sorry, I'm a honky.

2313
02:52:20,880 --> 02:52:25,840
Jazz says, I don't have an F.U. because I'm a happy little hoe. My F.U. is that I don't have an F.U.

2314
02:52:25,840 --> 02:52:28,880
because I'm a happy little hoe.

2315
02:52:28,880 --> 02:52:32,080
John Fields says, F you to humanity in general.

2316
02:52:32,080 --> 02:52:34,860
Yeah, humans suck.

2317
02:52:34,860 --> 02:52:36,960
Without humanity, you wouldn't exist.

2318
02:52:36,960 --> 02:52:38,720
You'd be in a world of nothingness.

2319
02:52:38,720 --> 02:52:40,440
You'd be a robot.

2320
02:52:40,440 --> 02:52:42,200
23rd Magus says, F you to people who

2321
02:52:42,200 --> 02:52:44,200
think they know it's in my head, and then proceed

2322
02:52:44,200 --> 02:52:46,000
to put words in my mouth.

2323
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,760
F you to Solo 2000, you suck, you don't deserve to exist,

2324
02:52:48,760 --> 02:52:51,280
you are inferior, good day, sir.

2325
02:52:51,280 --> 02:52:53,600
I disagree, 6th panel owns you, but whatever.

2326
02:52:53,600 --> 02:52:55,840
You're entitled to your opinion, even if you're wrong.

2327
02:52:55,840 --> 02:52:57,560
23rd Magus continues to say, fuck

2328
02:52:57,560 --> 02:53:01,220
not getting a call back from either Radio Shack or Papa Murphy's. How hard is it to

2329
02:53:01,220 --> 02:53:05,120
email me or leave a fucking message? Die, K, thanks, bye. When they don't call you,

2330
02:53:05,120 --> 02:53:19,120
you call them. That's my advice. Wampa164 says, F you to teenage kids. They can't drive,

2331
02:53:19,120 --> 02:53:23,720
but think they have and deserve more rights and have no respect for their elders anymore.

2332
02:54:23,720 --> 02:54:28,520
the word ass hat. The word is lame and annoying in my opinion. Oh shit, I just said it. God,

2333
02:54:28,520 --> 02:54:34,240
you're an ass hat. Stop being such an ass hat. You are wearing your ass as a hat. Stop

2334
02:54:34,240 --> 02:54:43,000
being an ass hat. F you to the person who suggested switching vanilla sky with orange

2335
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:48,400
lounge radio because I'm not coming in on Sunday evenings. You switch them. It was Monday

2336
02:55:18,400 --> 02:55:42,400
I don't care, other folks don't care, so why the fuck do you have to scream about how I

2337
02:55:42,400 --> 02:55:45,000
got 4 grades on 1998 Extra Stage?

2338
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:46,000
Guess what?

2339
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:47,640
I don't appreciate it, and I hope you get pregnant.

2340
02:55:47,640 --> 02:55:52,240
No, because then that means there'll be more of them.

2341
02:55:52,240 --> 02:55:56,840
Fat old fuck you goes to the nasty smelling shit logs that take my turn on initial D.

2342
02:55:56,840 --> 02:56:00,000
Hey, how about I take a fucking broken bottle to your head, then we'll see how badly you

2343
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:01,000
want my turn.

2344
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,320
You suck shit anyway, and you don't deserve life to begin with.

2345
02:56:03,320 --> 02:56:05,200
Wow, there's a lot of anger in here.

2346
02:56:05,200 --> 02:56:11,240
I know it's initial D. Why are you getting concerned anyway?

2347
02:56:11,240 --> 02:56:12,880
After his, I have another one.

2348
02:56:12,880 --> 02:56:14,240
We're almost done.

2349
02:56:14,240 --> 02:56:18,400
We're getting the last straggling FUs now, so that means I'm turning the music off because

2350
02:56:18,400 --> 02:56:19,400
these are stragglers.

2351
02:56:19,400 --> 02:56:27,960
Ewan Aoki 2DX has one last FU to his USB wireless adapter for blue-screening my system.

2352
02:56:27,960 --> 02:56:31,600
And Wampa would also like to say, FU to MTV for being a piece of shit.

2353
02:56:31,600 --> 02:56:36,200
They don't even play music but brainwash our youth and corrupt them to shit.

2354
02:56:36,200 --> 02:56:40,640
Similarly, FU to the same teenage kids that can't drive but instead ride their shitty

2355
02:56:40,640 --> 02:56:41,640
racer scooters.

2356
02:56:41,640 --> 02:56:47,840
lastly F you to midterms from stapler X that's the last one no more I just

2357
02:56:47,840 --> 02:56:55,760
wanted to add that I just forgot what I was gonna say way to go oh yeah I would

2358
02:56:55,760 --> 02:57:00,440
it is a stupid bitch on the riding rock online community on live journal her

2359
02:57:00,440 --> 02:57:06,280
account got banned and her husband's account got banned and you know for well

2360
02:57:06,280 --> 02:57:09,880
the thing is they don't know and gravity's not replying back the thing is

2361
02:57:09,880 --> 02:57:15,540
though I understand that I would be upset if my account were banned, you know.

2362
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:20,600
But they didn't check, apparently she did not check the ban list to see

2363
02:57:20,600 --> 02:57:23,720
if it was a temporary ban or a permanent ban.

2364
02:57:24,140 --> 02:57:28,160
She did not stop to think that because they've recently been hacked,

2365
02:57:29,060 --> 02:57:32,840
that this could be a maintenance issue and that their accounts will be reinstated once they've

2366
02:57:32,920 --> 02:57:35,560
completed whatever it is that they're doing, you know.

2367
02:57:35,560 --> 02:57:41,640
Instead, she's acting rude to everybody on the list, and acting like this is her life.

2368
02:57:41,640 --> 02:57:44,120
It's a stupid game.

2369
02:57:44,120 --> 02:57:50,040
So if you think we're assholes when it comes to DDR, go look at this community.

2370
02:57:50,040 --> 02:57:51,040
I would be upset.

2371
02:57:51,040 --> 02:57:56,960
Like I said, I'd be upset if I was unjustly banned, if I didn't do anything, but she was

2372
02:57:56,960 --> 02:58:01,100
just being really rude and nasty to people with no reason to do it.

2373
02:58:01,100 --> 02:58:07,300
And they were offering legitimate suggestions, things that she can do, the different solutions

2374
02:58:07,300 --> 02:58:08,300
to her problem.

2375
02:58:08,300 --> 02:58:13,700
But all that she wanted to do was bitch about the service, and she didn't even take any

2376
02:58:13,700 --> 02:58:19,720
of the proper steps to be sure that it was indeed a true banning.

2377
02:58:19,720 --> 02:58:22,340
Like I said, it didn't have to do with the maintenance or anything.

2378
02:58:22,340 --> 02:58:24,000
This person was so stupid.

2379
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:33,560
Just go to livejournal.com users slash ragnarokonline and it's probably one of the older ones now

2380
02:58:33,560 --> 02:58:39,440
but she's a really stupid bitch and needs to be slapped inside her head.

2381
02:58:39,440 --> 02:58:42,040
She doesn't deserve her ragnarok online anyway if she's not addicted to it.

2382
02:58:42,040 --> 02:58:43,680
Are you going to slap her with your dick?

2383
02:58:43,680 --> 02:58:45,880
I don't have one.

2384
02:58:45,880 --> 02:58:46,880
If you had one.

2385
02:58:46,880 --> 02:58:47,880
Your hypothetical dick.

2386
02:58:47,880 --> 02:58:48,880
I would slap her.

2387
02:58:48,880 --> 02:58:49,880
Your internet penis.

2388
02:58:49,880 --> 02:58:52,280
would slap her with the Red Bull cock.

2389
02:58:52,280 --> 02:58:55,120
All right.

2390
02:58:55,120 --> 02:58:57,600
Speaking of LiveJournal, Orange Lounge

2391
02:58:57,600 --> 02:59:00,000
has a LiveJournal community that is posted every once

2392
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:01,160
in a great while.

2393
02:59:01,160 --> 02:59:04,400
Hey, well, actually, we've got quite a few people watching it.

2394
02:59:04,400 --> 02:59:07,240
Well, there's some news and some questions

2395
02:59:07,240 --> 02:59:09,920
that get asked on there.

2396
02:59:09,920 --> 02:59:13,240
It's a username, Orange Lounge, all one word.

2397
02:59:13,240 --> 02:59:15,040
And there is a DDR one.

2398
02:59:15,040 --> 02:59:20,280
It's actually the live journal community, Bimani.

2399
02:59:20,280 --> 02:59:23,040
I think there's also a DDR one, but it's kind of.

2400
02:59:23,040 --> 02:59:24,000
No one updates it.

2401
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:24,880
Yeah, it's kind of.

2402
02:59:24,880 --> 02:59:26,720
Just look for the Bimani one.

2403
02:59:26,720 --> 02:59:31,480
And on Dead Journal, there's DDR Maniacs.

2404
02:59:31,480 --> 02:59:34,120
Oh, pretty cool.

2405
02:59:34,120 --> 02:59:35,600
Well, we're winding down the show here.

2406
02:59:35,600 --> 02:59:37,140
We're getting into the home stretch.

2407
02:59:37,140 --> 02:59:38,760
Loki, is there anything we missed?

2408
02:59:38,760 --> 02:59:40,800
You and I had tons of topics we wanted to talk about tonight.

2409
02:59:40,800 --> 02:59:43,300
Is there any last minute things we had we forgot to talk about?

2410
02:59:43,300 --> 02:59:44,360
We did the UPN story.

2411
02:59:44,360 --> 02:59:50,480
We did the ranting about the bootleg machines and the new games and all that stuff.

2412
02:59:50,480 --> 02:59:51,600
He's thinking.

2413
02:59:51,600 --> 02:59:58,720
He's off in La La Land.

2414
02:59:58,720 --> 02:59:59,720
Altar Makes Go is gold.

2415
02:59:59,720 --> 03:00:01,080
I thought that's kind of old news.

2416
03:00:01,080 --> 03:00:02,080
I don't know.

2417
03:00:02,080 --> 03:00:04,200
Altar Makes comes out on the 18th of November and-

2418
03:00:04,200 --> 03:00:06,200
That's going to be when I'm in-

2419
03:00:06,200 --> 03:00:07,200
No, I think I'll be-

2420
03:00:07,200 --> 03:00:09,840
Don't you come back right about then?

2421
03:00:09,840 --> 03:00:12,200
I need to look at a calendar.

2422
03:00:12,200 --> 03:00:13,200
I think so.

2423
03:00:13,200 --> 03:00:17,200
that's about the time I'm going to be back. Oh, oh, oh, I have happy news.

2424
03:00:17,200 --> 03:00:21,200
Okay. Oh, God, that hurt. For old-school gamers.

2425
03:00:21,200 --> 03:00:27,200
Okay. There is, for anyone who remembers on the Sega Saturn, the Sega Ages collection,

2426
03:00:27,200 --> 03:00:33,200
where they were, well, in the U.S. they released multiple games on one disc,

2427
03:00:33,200 --> 03:00:38,200
but in Japan they were, each game was released individually, like Space Harrier, you know, all this.

2428
03:00:38,200 --> 03:00:44,200
Well, they're doing Sega Ages 2500, which basically, for the PS2, it's remakes of old

2429
03:00:44,200 --> 03:00:53,260
Sega games that were supposed to sell for 2,500 yen, about 23 something, and they've

2430
03:00:53,260 --> 03:01:00,280
released Space Harrier, which I ordered, Fantasy Zone, which is my second favorite game ever,

2431
03:01:00,280 --> 03:01:05,880
and so I ordered that too, Fantasy Star, which is a really nice remake, those are the three

2432
03:01:05,880 --> 03:01:06,880
that I ordered.

2433
03:01:06,880 --> 03:01:12,200
that are out right now is Monaco GP and Goldnax.

2434
03:01:13,320 --> 03:01:15,000
So the best prices I've seen

2435
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:21,320
for our most reliable site is toysnjoys.com, T-O-Y-S-N-J-O-Y-S dot com.

2436
03:01:21,740 --> 03:01:22,820
They're located in Hawaii.

2437
03:01:22,820 --> 03:01:23,720
They have really fast shipping.

2438
03:01:24,280 --> 03:01:26,340
And they're selling it for 25 bucks.

2439
03:01:27,040 --> 03:01:31,720
So, but that, I just had to make the mention for all the old school people

2440
03:01:31,720 --> 03:01:33,160
because it's really neat that they're doing that.

2441
03:01:33,160 --> 03:01:40,040
Oh, what, Logie? Come say that on the mic, because that's big news to me, because that

2442
03:01:40,040 --> 03:01:43,740
kind of is an epilogue to something we were talking about just a minute ago.

2443
03:01:43,740 --> 03:01:47,320
Euromix 3 is coming out next year, early spring, I think.

2444
03:01:47,320 --> 03:01:52,280
So at least somewhere, someone is continuing to do DDR. Some Konami company is continuing

2445
03:01:52,280 --> 03:01:56,600
to do DDR. That's a good sign. So is Europe doing DDR the way it needs to be done?

2446
03:01:56,600 --> 03:01:57,600
I don't know.

2447
03:01:57,600 --> 03:02:00,520
Well, the only thing that I've heard about it is that Wannabes is going to be on it.

2448
03:02:00,520 --> 03:02:01,520
That was one of the tracks.

2449
03:02:01,520 --> 03:02:02,520
Joy of joys.

2450
03:02:02,520 --> 03:02:06,980
Well, it doesn't matter. It's just it's a song that's in DDR. It's a new mix

2451
03:02:06,980 --> 03:02:11,140
Yeah, but is that is that some fanboys wet dream or is that something has actually been documented somewhere?

2452
03:02:11,140 --> 03:02:13,140
It's like is that announced somewhere has announced

2453
03:02:14,660 --> 03:02:16,660
DDR UK is all over it

2454
03:02:17,160 --> 03:02:19,860
So because I believe anything they say

2455
03:02:20,940 --> 03:02:23,760
Well, they're pretty on top of it for your mix. Yeah

2456
03:02:23,760 --> 03:02:27,560
For most DDR news sites, they're pretty respectable.

2457
03:02:27,560 --> 03:02:30,080
Yeah, I mean, they've got the UK end covered.

2458
03:02:33,120 --> 03:02:37,000
But let's see.

2459
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:38,800
Well, if that's all the news you've got,

2460
03:02:38,800 --> 03:02:41,080
I guess we can go ahead and wrap up the show here.

2461
03:02:41,080 --> 03:02:44,200
Yeah, that's all the news I can think of.

2462
03:02:44,200 --> 03:02:46,960
All right, let's go around and see what everybody's.

2463
03:02:46,960 --> 03:02:48,480
Oh, and Jamie would like this.

2464
03:02:48,480 --> 03:02:51,160
They're selling second mix machines on eBay right now,

2465
03:02:51,160 --> 03:02:53,040
a couple of them.

2466
03:02:53,040 --> 03:02:56,640
I don't remember it wasn't like $4,000 with some insane amount you get an

2467
03:02:56,640 --> 03:02:57,560
extreme gain for.

2468
03:02:57,720 --> 03:02:58,000
Yeah.

2469
03:02:58,240 --> 03:03:02,000
Well, the thing is, is that, and Dan and I have sat down, talked to that,

2470
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:04,480
what made it official, we're buying our house in the spring.

2471
03:03:05,320 --> 03:03:08,560
Um, actually next, uh, next spring we're buying our house.

2472
03:03:08,560 --> 03:03:10,840
We will have a house and we will have a DVR machine.

2473
03:03:11,400 --> 03:03:14,000
So, um, but the thing is, we're probably going to have an extreme.

2474
03:03:14,680 --> 03:03:15,840
Why not a second mix?

2475
03:03:16,360 --> 03:03:18,600
Because you can't grade a second mix.

2476
03:03:20,160 --> 03:03:21,240
Get bootleg third.

2477
03:03:21,240 --> 03:03:23,120
Get a third Korean, third Korean.

2478
03:03:23,120 --> 03:03:24,880
No, I do not want the third.

2479
03:03:24,880 --> 03:03:27,400
If I get a third mix, it's going to be a third plus.

2480
03:03:27,400 --> 03:03:28,240
Whatever.

2481
03:03:28,240 --> 03:03:29,480
All right.

2482
03:03:29,480 --> 03:03:31,480
OK, let's go around to Garibay's final thought.

2483
03:03:31,480 --> 03:03:32,480
Now the show's wrapping up.

2484
03:03:32,480 --> 03:03:33,580
Bradley, we'll start with Bradley,

2485
03:03:33,580 --> 03:03:34,960
our guest for this evening.

2486
03:03:34,960 --> 03:03:37,400
Wasn't said much, but that's OK.

2487
03:03:37,400 --> 03:03:40,040
That's what he's known for.

2488
03:03:40,040 --> 03:03:42,040
All right.

2489
03:03:42,040 --> 03:03:43,320
Be active, not passive.

2490
03:03:43,320 --> 03:03:47,320
Let my performance today be an example of what not to do.

2491
03:03:47,320 --> 03:03:52,000
Okay, final thought.

2492
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:53,960
I'm going to be done with my cabinet this week.

2493
03:03:53,960 --> 03:03:56,320
Didn't you say that last week?

2494
03:03:56,320 --> 03:03:57,960
No, really this time.

2495
03:03:57,960 --> 03:03:58,960
I'm on last.

2496
03:03:58,960 --> 03:03:59,960
No, no, really.

2497
03:03:59,960 --> 03:04:00,960
I swear I'm going to be done.

2498
03:04:00,960 --> 03:04:06,840
Well, with part of it at least, I'll be done with the major cutting of the cabinet.

2499
03:04:06,840 --> 03:04:11,920
Will we actually have a wooden empty cabinet at the end of this week?

2500
03:04:11,920 --> 03:04:12,920
Possibly.

2501
03:04:12,920 --> 03:04:16,680
I'm thinking battery power is the only thing stopping me.

2502
03:04:16,680 --> 03:04:23,820
I have, like, all the sheets I have left to cut are just rectangular, so, I mean, it's

2503
03:04:23,820 --> 03:04:28,260
not anything complex or anything. And then it's just putting it together. That's pretty

2504
03:04:28,260 --> 03:04:35,360
much it. You know, it's not much left. So, maybe. Maybe we'll have a cabinet by the end

2505
03:04:35,360 --> 03:04:46,140
of the week. Who knows? I'll be waiting. Jamie, your final thought. Ow! My final thought

2506
03:04:46,140 --> 03:04:51,780
That is, I'm so happy I only have to work two days next week.

2507
03:04:51,780 --> 03:04:52,780
That makes me giddy.

2508
03:04:52,780 --> 03:04:54,900
And you don't have to work a full week.

2509
03:04:54,900 --> 03:04:57,540
I wouldn't exactly call what I do work, but sure.

2510
03:04:57,540 --> 03:05:00,660
I get two weeks off in a row, huh?

2511
03:05:00,660 --> 03:05:01,660
Blimey.

2512
03:05:01,660 --> 03:05:02,940
All right.

2513
03:05:02,940 --> 03:05:03,940
That's it.

2514
03:05:03,940 --> 03:05:04,940
Final word of the show tonight.

2515
03:05:04,940 --> 03:05:08,620
Nellie, you want to take a stab at one word, Nellie?

2516
03:05:08,620 --> 03:05:10,260
Can you say one word?

2517
03:05:10,260 --> 03:05:11,260
Just one?

2518
03:05:11,260 --> 03:05:12,260
No.

2519
03:05:12,260 --> 03:05:17,980
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2520
03:05:17,980 --> 03:05:22,140
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Skye and Loki.

2521
03:05:22,140 --> 03:05:24,500
We expect you a nice play again.

2522
03:05:24,500 --> 03:05:31,500
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2523
03:05:54,500 --> 03:06:15,820
Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.

2524
03:06:24,500 --> 03:06:49,660
Orange Lounge Radio, the after birth, the part after the credits have faded out.

2525
03:06:49,660 --> 03:06:54,420
We'll add a little bit of WTF to tonight's fortune cookie, Jamie.

2526
03:06:54,420 --> 03:06:56,060
Explain yourself.

2527
03:06:56,060 --> 03:07:00,780
I was going through my waves and I could not decide on one, so I picked the Sailor Stars

2528
03:07:00,780 --> 03:07:07,720
transformation from the last season of Sailor Moon in Japanese, of course, which I actually

2529
03:07:07,720 --> 03:07:13,480
thought was a pretty good series because they killed Chibusa, except they brought in Chibi

2530
03:07:13,480 --> 03:07:15,980
Chibi and she needed to die too.

2531
03:07:15,980 --> 03:07:24,380
Yes, I was a Sailor Moon fan once when it was like new, but...

2532
03:07:24,380 --> 03:07:26,500
I watched a couple episodes of it once.

2533
03:07:26,500 --> 03:07:28,820
You watched the crap version.

2534
03:07:28,820 --> 03:07:29,940
I have like...

2535
03:07:29,940 --> 03:07:35,180
I can show you some quality Sailor Moon.

2536
03:07:35,180 --> 03:07:36,620
I just...

2537
03:07:36,620 --> 03:07:39,660
The quality Sailor Moon, isn't that a bit of a...

2538
03:07:39,660 --> 03:07:40,660
No.

2539
03:07:40,660 --> 03:07:44,460
I like Tuxedo Mask.

2540
03:07:44,460 --> 03:07:48,620
coming but the guy they have playing them in the live-action series is ugly

2541
03:07:48,620 --> 03:07:56,060
he's ugly I don't care what our bales we say he's ugly all right anything else

2542
03:07:56,060 --> 03:07:58,260
you guys want to say in this little portion after the credits have faded

2543
03:07:58,260 --> 03:08:14,620
here. Ow. My head hurts. I smell like sawdust. At least you don't have pea beef. Beef, beef.

2544
03:08:14,620 --> 03:08:21,560
Did your pee smell like beef tonight? Or pork? No. It's just the beef soup. That's like that

2545
03:08:21,560 --> 03:08:35,560
Thank you everybody for listening to and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2546

2549

And we get reported on by the news.

2558
03:09:08,840 --> 03:09:09,840
That's right.

2559
03:09:09,840 --> 03:09:12,400
And then we can be on UPN 31 too because we'll be cool.

2561
03:09:16,760 --> 03:09:22,920
Tonight's post show you guys, this is an album I think some of you guys have been wanting

2562
03:09:22,920 --> 03:09:25,840
to hear. It's a brand new Dance Mania album that just hit the shelves a couple of weeks

2563
03:09:25,840 --> 03:09:33,340
ago and we got a copy of it here. Thank you very much Tiger for passing this along. This

2564
03:09:33,340 --> 03:09:40,360
is Dance Mania Trance Z is tonight's post show so enjoy and thanks for supporting Orange

2565
03:09:40,360 --> 03:09:42,360
launch radio. Good night.

2566
03:10:10,360 --> 03:10:17,360
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry I just want you to stay

2567
03:10:40,360 --> 03:11:05,360
I just want you to stay in my arms

2568
03:11:10,360 --> 03:11:35,360
Everybody needs a little time away

2569
03:11:35,360 --> 03:11:45,360
Far away from nature.

2570
03:11:45,360 --> 03:11:51,360
Even lovers need a holiday.

2571
03:11:51,360 --> 03:11:57,360
Far away from nature.

2572
03:11:57,360 --> 03:12:08,360
Ooh, now it's time for me to say I'm sorry I just want you to stay

2573
03:12:57,360 --> 03:13:19,640
Do you believe in destiny, and close my eyes and dream that you are closer to me?

2574
03:13:19,640 --> 03:13:33,640
So follow me, and you will see, together we can touch the sky, we're flying so high, high, high.

2575
03:13:49,640 --> 03:14:14,640
I'm free in the light of the night Until the morning sky

2576
03:14:14,640 --> 03:14:20,640
I feel alive tonight

2577
03:14:21,640 --> 03:14:27,640
I feel the morning light

2578
03:14:30,640 --> 03:14:33,640
Do you believe?

2579
03:14:38,640 --> 03:14:40,640
Is this the thing?

2580
03:14:40,640 --> 03:14:47,640
I know you need to be with me

2581
03:14:47,640 --> 03:14:54,640
When something feels so good, it's only about the me

2582
03:14:54,640 --> 03:15:00,640
As time goes by, I wonder why

2583
03:15:00,640 --> 03:15:07,640
When you will be here with me someday, I'll fade anyway

2584
03:15:20,640 --> 03:15:26,640
I'm free and alive and blind

2585
03:15:26,640 --> 03:15:33,640
I'm still the morning sky

2586
03:15:33,640 --> 03:15:40,640
I'm free like the sky

2587
03:15:40,640 --> 03:15:48,640
I'm still the morning sky

2588
03:15:48,640 --> 03:15:51,640
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody

2589
03:15:51,640 --> 03:15:54,640

2593
03:16:43,640 --> 03:16:47,640
I wanna dance, dance, dance.

Yeah, yeah.

2595
03:16:51,640 --> 03:16:57,640
Yeah, with somebody who loves me

2596
03:16:57,640 --> 03:17:00,640
Oh, yeah

I wanna come and see somebody

2601
03:17:15,640 --> 03:17:19,640
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody

2602
03:17:19,640 --> 03:17:22,640
With somebody who loves me

2603
03:17:22,640 --> 03:17:25,640
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody

2604
03:17:25,640 --> 03:17:28,640
Somebody who loves me, yeah

Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody

2606
03:17:32,640 --> 03:17:35,640
The whole thing is all love

2607
03:17:35,640 --> 03:17:37,640
I need a man who takes a chance

2608
03:17:37,640 --> 03:17:41,640
On a love that burns high enough to last

2609
03:17:41,640 --> 03:17:43,640
And when the night falls

2610
03:17:43,640 --> 03:17:47,640
My lonely heart calls

2611
03:17:47,640 --> 03:17:55,940
I wanna dance with somebody I wanna turn my feet with somebody

2612
03:17:56,940 --> 03:18:03,040

Yeah, we dance with somebody, with somebody who loves me

2615
03:18:29,440 --> 03:18:34,440
I could see the way, just to hear you breathing

2616
03:18:34,440 --> 03:18:41,440
Watch you smile while you are sleeping, while you're far away dreaming

2617
03:18:41,440 --> 03:18:47,440
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender

2618
03:18:47,440 --> 03:18:54,440
I could stay lost in this moment forever

2619
03:18:54,440 --> 03:19:02,440
Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

2620
03:19:02,440 --> 03:19:06,440
I don't want to close my eyes

2621
03:19:06,440 --> 03:19:08,440
I don't want to fall asleep

2622
03:19:08,440 --> 03:19:10,440
But I miss you baby

2623
03:19:10,440 --> 03:19:13,440
And I don't want to miss a thing

2624
03:19:13,440 --> 03:19:16,440
Cause even when I dream of you

2625
03:19:16,440 --> 03:19:18,440
The sweetest dream would never do

2626
03:19:18,440 --> 03:19:20,440
I still miss you baby

2627
03:19:20,440 --> 03:19:24,440
And I don't want to feel the same

2628
03:19:35,440 --> 03:19:41,440
Flying close to you, feeling your heart beating

2629
03:19:41,440 --> 03:19:44,440
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming

2630
03:19:44,440 --> 03:19:48,440
Wondering if there's me you're seeing

2631
03:19:48,440 --> 03:19:54,440
Then I kiss your eyes, and thank God we're together

2632
03:19:54,440 --> 03:20:00,440
And I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever

2633
03:20:00,440 --> 03:20:02,440
Forever and ever

2634
03:20:02,440 --> 03:20:05,440
I don't wanna close my eyes

2635
03:20:05,440 --> 03:20:09,440
I don't wanna fall asleep cause I'll catch you baby

2636
03:20:09,440 --> 03:20:12,440
And I don't wanna miss a thing

2637
03:20:12,440 --> 03:20:15,440
Even when I dream of you

2638
03:20:15,440 --> 03:20:41,960
I don't want to miss one smile I don't want to miss one kiss

2639
03:20:41,960 --> 03:20:48,960
Cause I just wanna be with you, right here with you, just like this

03:20:48,960 --> 03:20:55,960
I just wanna hold you close, feel your heart go close to mine

2641
03:20:55,960 --> 03:21:02,960

Part of the way that I said

2666

There's nothing else to compare

2667
03:30:15,340 --> 03:30:19,340
The thought of you leaves me weak

2668
03:30:19,340 --> 03:30:22,340
There are no words left to speak

2669
03:30:22,340 --> 03:30:25,340
But if you feel like I feel

03:30:25,340 --> 03:30:32,340

03:32:15,420 --> 03:32:20,420

2698
03:32:24,420 --> 03:32:28,900
And I said, hey, yeah, yeah.

2699
03:32:28,900 --> 03:32:31,900
Hey, yeah, yeah.

2700
03:32:31,900 --> 03:32:37,900
I said, hey, what's going on?

2701
03:32:37,900 --> 03:32:42,160
And I said, hey, hey hey!

2702
03:32:42,160 --> 03:32:44,900
Hey, hey, hey!

2703
03:32:44,900 --> 03:32:45,620
I said, hey!

2704
03:32:47,620 --> 03:32:49,100
What's going on?

2705
03:32:51,060 --> 03:32:55,400
And I said, hey, hey, hey!

2706
03:32:55,400 --> 03:32:58,160
Hey, hey, hey!

2707
03:32:58,160 --> 03:33:00,740
I said, hey!

2708
03:33:00,740 --> 03:33:04,180
What's going on?

2709
03:33:04,180 --> 03:33:14,160
And I say, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

2710
03:33:14,160 --> 03:33:15,660
What's going on?

2711
03:33:18,640 --> 03:33:21,640
35 years of my life in the steel.

2712
03:33:21,640 --> 03:33:27,120
I'm trying to get up the crappy hill of hope.

2713
03:33:27,120 --> 03:33:31,620
For a destination.

2714
03:33:31,620 --> 03:33:34,420
I realized quickly when I knew I should

2715
03:33:34,420 --> 03:33:36,720
That the world was made up of this

2716
03:33:36,720 --> 03:33:38,720
Fatherhood of hands

2717
03:33:40,420 --> 03:33:42,420
Over there that dreams

2718
03:33:44,420 --> 03:33:47,720
Into the quiet sun, I'll shine a light for friends

2719
03:33:47,720 --> 03:33:51,020
But to get it all up was in my head

2720
03:33:51,020 --> 03:33:55,620
And I, I'm feeling a little superior

2721
03:33:57,620 --> 03:34:00,820
Into the wind in the morning and at the first night

2722
03:34:00,820 --> 03:34:04,220
And I take a deep breath, and I can't breathe higher

2723
03:34:04,220 --> 03:34:06,820
And I can't go back all my life

2724
03:34:06,820 --> 03:34:08,820
What's going on?

2725
03:34:09,820 --> 03:34:14,820
And I said, hey, yeah, yeah

2726
03:34:14,820 --> 03:34:16,820
Hey, yeah, yeah

2727
03:34:16,820 --> 03:34:18,820
I said, hey

2728
03:34:18,820 --> 03:34:22,820
What's going on?

2729
03:34:36,820 --> 03:34:41,820
And I try, oh my god, I try

2730
03:34:41,820 --> 03:34:45,820
I try all the time

2731
03:34:45,820 --> 03:34:49,820
In this institution

2732
03:34:49,820 --> 03:34:51,820
And I pray

2733
03:34:51,820 --> 03:34:54,820
What am I going to bring?

2734
03:34:54,820 --> 03:34:58,820
I pray for a single day

2735
03:34:58,820 --> 03:35:02,820
For a little desire

2736
03:35:02,820 --> 03:35:06,820
Into the questions of the life I've made

2737
03:35:06,820 --> 03:35:09,820
Just to get it all that was in my head

2738
03:35:09,820 --> 03:35:12,820
And I, I feel

2739
03:35:12,820 --> 03:35:14,820
A little easier

2740
03:35:16,820 --> 03:35:19,820
Until I wake in the morning and I step outside

2741
03:35:19,820 --> 03:35:22,820
And I take back the questions that I can't resound

2742
03:35:22,820 --> 03:35:25,820
And I scream from above and I say

2743
03:35:25,820 --> 03:35:27,820
What's going on?

2744
03:35:28,820 --> 03:35:29,820
And I said

2745
03:35:29,820 --> 03:35:33,820
Hey, yeah, yeah

2746
03:35:33,820 --> 03:35:35,820
Hey, yeah, yeah

2747
03:35:35,820 --> 03:35:37,820
I said hey

2748
03:35:38,820 --> 03:35:40,820
What's going on?

2749
03:35:40,820 --> 03:35:49,820
Can't touch this.

2750
03:35:49,820 --> 03:35:56,820
Can't touch this.

2751
03:35:56,820 --> 03:36:04,820
Can't touch this.

2752
03:36:04,820 --> 03:36:22,940
You can't touch this.

2753
03:36:22,940 --> 03:36:29,940
You can't touch this.
