1
00:00:30,214 --> 00:00:40,598
[SPEAKER_11]: I need you, I need you everyday I love you more and more without you I need you, I need you

2
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:22,684
[SPEAKER_11]: We are young, heartache to heartache.

3
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Love is a battlefield

4
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:28,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

5
00:07:32,014 --> 00:07:36,878
[SPEAKER_19]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, for mommy talk and then some.

6
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:40,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

7
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,663
[SPEAKER_19]: Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

8
00:07:45,284 --> 00:07:50,087
[SPEAKER_19]: Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

9
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:54,370
[SPEAKER_19]: You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

10
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I will spank your child.

11
00:07:56,572 --> 00:07:58,293
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

12
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,540
12th

13
00:08:03,976 --> 00:08:10,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.

14
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:33,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah?

15
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:37,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

16
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:38,340
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura.

17
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,261
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got a sniff.

18
00:08:39,662 --> 00:08:40,202
[SPEAKER_19]: Skye.

19
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:42,405
[SPEAKER_19]: But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

20
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:43,286
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki.

21
00:08:43,546 --> 00:08:44,567
[SPEAKER_19]: I hate you!

22
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:46,629
[SPEAKER_19]: Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_03]: We are live and this is episode number... We are live and this is episode number 66 for October the 26th of 2003.

26
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:21,503
[SPEAKER_03]: You're tuned into the Bimani Scene's most underprepared radio station of all things Bimani.

27
00:09:22,637 --> 00:09:23,637
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

28

[SPEAKER_03]: In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers.

31
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:30,798
[SPEAKER_03]: You know her better as DarkSakura.

32
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:33,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how much of a voice left there for.

33
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:35,179
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be speaking in spirit all evening.

34
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:35,979
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

35
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,520
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

36
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,460
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you feeling this week?

37
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Better than last week?

38
00:09:43,821 --> 00:09:44,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Better.

39
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:44,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

40
00:09:46,641 --> 00:09:49,082
[SPEAKER_03]: In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

41
00:09:49,102 --> 00:09:50,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

42
00:09:50,602 --> 00:09:50,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

43
00:09:52,945 --> 00:09:54,707
[SPEAKER_03]: The other special guest of my laundry.

44
00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:12,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we have something that is now even worse than Gator.

46
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:36,803
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something out there.

47
00:10:36,823 --> 00:10:38,404
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a software for your computer.

48
00:10:38,684 --> 00:10:40,385
[SPEAKER_03]: It is worse than Gator.

49
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:41,626
[SPEAKER_03]: It is worse than Banzai Buddy.

50
00:10:41,886 --> 00:10:44,448
[SPEAKER_03]: It is worse than Gator with a Banzai Buddy.

51
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:48,430
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the worst spam software you could ever have on your computer.

52
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,251
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be talking about that later.

53
00:10:50,912 --> 00:10:51,512
Okay.

54
00:10:52,974 --> 00:10:54,435

Darlin', Darlin', you can see me here, right?

57
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:45,893
Darlin', Darlin', I'll forget about that day.

58
00:12:45,913 --> 00:12:48,915
Darlin', Darlin', maybe you know how I feel.

59
00:13:12,172 --> 00:13:19,154
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't help falling in love with you Shall I say what they say?

00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:05,871
[SPEAKER_11]: and many more.

65
00:16:31,831 --> 00:16:41,757
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a whole shitload of people there tonight just waiting to talk to you and tell you where our webcam's at if you want to stare at us, although Jamie never is on cam.

66
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, $2.99 a minute.

67
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,601
[SPEAKER_06]: We might talk to you in other ways.

68
00:16:47,641 --> 00:16:48,002
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

69
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I charge for my PMs.

70
00:16:53,085 --> 00:17:01,133
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the only way you can vote in the cage match and also send your FUs of the week and all that stuff.

71
00:17:03,516 --> 00:17:05,638
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hello.

72
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:16,787
[SPEAKER_03]: So for those of you guys that listen to the show on a regular basis, I'm sure you've heard Loki in the past talk about his experiences when he goes to Raley's to get Chinese food.

73
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:22,473
[SPEAKER_03]: And the lady that works at the Raley's department that always says, Do you want a sample?

74
00:17:23,454 --> 00:17:26,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the sample lady at the Raley's.

75
00:17:26,998 --> 00:17:29,120
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had the chance today, Loki and I...

76
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:36,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki and I went down to Walmart today to run some errands and do something else that we're going to talk about much later in the show.

77
00:17:37,634 --> 00:17:41,937
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to Walmart and then we went over to Rayleigh's to get some dinner because I was going to get some Chinese food.

78
00:17:42,498 --> 00:17:45,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And Loki said, hey, this is the Rayleigh's where the sample lady works at.

79
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:51,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was all excited because I didn't realize that we were going to the Rayleigh's where the sample lady works at because I always thought she worked at another one.

80
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Rayleigh's, for those who don't know, because I forget, it's probably only in California.

81
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:55,847
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big grocery store chain.

82
00:17:56,147 --> 00:17:57,428
[SPEAKER_03]: So Rayleigh's is a big grocery store.

83
00:17:57,928 --> 00:18:00,909
[SPEAKER_03]: and this is the most fucked up Raley's I've ever seen.

84
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:02,690
[SPEAKER_03]: This Raley's here in Folsom where we live.

85
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,291
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the Rainbow Cafe.

86
00:18:05,832 --> 00:18:08,473
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, when you walk right in the door, the Rainbow Cafe.

87
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:12,414
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like something that belongs in Lavender Heights in Midtown.

88
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:18,897
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have the Rainbow Cafe when you walk through the door and then right next to the Rainbow Cafe is the takeout place.

89
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:19,798
[SPEAKER_03]: What do they call it?

90
00:18:19,818 --> 00:18:20,278
[SPEAKER_03]: The Hot Walk.

91
00:18:21,406 --> 00:18:21,846
[SPEAKER_03]: A hot walk.

92
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:25,549
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Loki and I walk in and Loki's like, Oh my God, the sample lady's working today.

93
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:27,269
[SPEAKER_03]: That's her, that's her.

94
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,071
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got all excited because I saw the sample lady.

95
00:18:29,471 --> 00:18:35,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, since I saw the sample lady, there was nothing I wanted more than to hear her go, You want sample?

96
00:18:36,555 --> 00:18:36,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

97
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:39,176
[SPEAKER_03]: So Loki gets up there and orders his food.

98
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:41,137
[SPEAKER_03]: And shockingly enough, she didn't say it.

99
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:42,338
[SPEAKER_03]: She didn't say it to him.

100
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:46,961
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was starting to get all upset because I'm like, I can't be here and not hear the you want sample thing.

101
00:18:47,381 --> 00:18:48,622
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went up there and I was like,

102
00:18:49,781 --> 00:18:52,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, um, yeah, can I try a little bit of the garlic chicken?

103
00:18:53,022 --> 00:18:53,962
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and try an egg rind.

104
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:54,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you want sample?

105
00:18:55,122 --> 00:18:55,702
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't work.

106
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:56,903
[SPEAKER_03]: She didn't say anything.

107
00:18:56,943 --> 00:19:00,224
[SPEAKER_03]: She just kind of like gave it to me and then got my meal and we were gone.

108
00:19:00,684 --> 00:19:03,024
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was this really stupid guy that was there too.

109
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:09,466
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, after I took my garlic chicken and I ate the little thing because they put it on a toothpick, they put a piece on toothpick so you need it.

110
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:11,686
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, so was it good?

111
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:13,787
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just like,

112
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:16,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

113
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,124
[SPEAKER_06]: People don't think that you're weird.

114
00:19:36,224 --> 00:19:36,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Eat me.

115
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:40,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so I didn't get to hear the You Want Sample thing.

116
00:19:40,187 --> 00:19:46,012
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the lady who was checking us out, she looked like a brunette Donatella Versace, which kind of scared me a little bit, you know?

117
00:19:46,032 --> 00:19:47,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God, that woman is... Get out!

118
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:49,415
[SPEAKER_06]: That woman is hideous looking.

119
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,357
[SPEAKER_06]: She looks like Droopy.

120
00:19:53,438 --> 00:19:56,061
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome to Donatella Versace's Halloween party.

121
00:19:56,881 --> 00:19:59,223
[SPEAKER_16]: I give you candy cigarettes.

122
00:19:59,503 --> 00:20:01,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some candy, here's some cigarettes.

123
00:20:02,096 --> 00:20:04,477
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I love when they impersonate Donatello Versace on Saturday Night Live.

124
00:20:04,517 --> 00:20:08,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so the lady who chipped us out looked like Donatello Versace.

125
00:20:08,638 --> 00:20:13,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there were these two kids that were like trying to play in one of those power wheelchairs.

126
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,361
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how like if you're handicapped and you go to the grocery store, they give you like a complimentary wheelchair to sit in?

127
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:20,322
[SPEAKER_21]: What a complimentary wheelchair.

128
00:20:20,342 --> 00:20:23,763
[SPEAKER_03]: There were these kids, and I swear to God, they were about ready to ram right into all the candy.

129
00:20:23,803 --> 00:20:24,183
[SPEAKER_03]: It was funny.

130
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:29,529
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm really upset because I didn't get to hear the you want sample thing, so I just have to rely on Loki.

131
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki is the only one that can do it.

132
00:20:34,152 --> 00:20:40,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he had to go, like, I'm trying to train her not to offer the samples, because she does it at the wrong times.

133
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:44,718
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you already get your food, you know, she's already given it to you, it's all ready to go.

134
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:51,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I got sweet and sour pork, and then she'll, like, give me a sample of sweet and sour pork, like, gee, I didn't know what it tasted like.

135
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:54,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, that's so good, maybe I should get some.

136
00:20:54,224 --> 00:20:55,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait, I already did.

137
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:57,807
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like, she's so retarded.

138
00:20:57,847 --> 00:21:03,351
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this other, on Friday, they had a person that was even dumber than she was, this old guy.

139
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:05,113
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like, oh, you want food?

140
00:21:05,173 --> 00:21:05,833
[SPEAKER_03]: You want Chinese?

141
00:21:06,574 --> 00:21:07,855
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of rice do you want?

142
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:10,637
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, so fucking annoying.

143
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:11,878
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so slow.

144
00:21:12,499 --> 00:21:14,460
[SPEAKER_03]: They like operate in another dimension.

145
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:16,242
[SPEAKER_07]: They operate in the fast path.

146
00:21:16,262 --> 00:21:17,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Friggin' old.

147
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:18,964
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um...

148
00:21:20,194 --> 00:21:21,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they sucked.

149
00:21:21,275 --> 00:21:25,138
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Rob had to go and ask for a sample, and now she thinks it's okay to ask for samples.

150
00:21:25,478 --> 00:21:27,560
[SPEAKER_03]: And then she went back to asking people for samples.

151
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,640
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it.

152
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:31,142
[SPEAKER_03]: You messed it all up for me.

153
00:21:32,003 --> 00:21:34,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God she recognized you when we walked in there.

154
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:38,648
[SPEAKER_03]: We walked in, and she looked at you with that, hi, look on her face.

155
00:21:38,788 --> 00:21:40,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of like, oh.

156
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:42,451
[SPEAKER_03]: She recognizes Loki as a frequent customer.

157
00:21:42,811 --> 00:21:45,693
[SPEAKER_03]: But what was so weird is right before you went up there to get help...

158
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:49,375
[SPEAKER_03]: She started, like, staring off into space.

159
00:21:49,435 --> 00:21:51,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, she was staring at some person on the other end of the store.

160
00:21:52,155 --> 00:21:55,076
[SPEAKER_03]: And mind you, there's a line of, like, five people there waiting at the counter.

161
00:21:55,116 --> 00:21:56,997
[SPEAKER_03]: She's just like... She's looking at her ancestors.

162
00:21:57,017 --> 00:21:58,297
[SPEAKER_03]: She's staring off into space.

163
00:21:58,377 --> 00:22:02,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like, you know, she's seeing the ghost of Christmas past in front of her or something.

164
00:22:02,098 --> 00:22:02,998
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking crazy.

165
00:22:03,878 --> 00:22:09,900
[SPEAKER_03]: So... But, you know, the woman's entertaining, so I'll continue to patronize that, Ray Lee.

166
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,361
[SPEAKER_03]: For nothing else than good stories to fill up time on Orange Radio.

167
00:22:12,381 --> 00:22:13,921
[SPEAKER_06]: I have plenty of things I could patronize.

168
00:22:16,696 --> 00:22:18,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, um... Completely different sense.

169
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:23,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start off the lovely show with How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?

170
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:27,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Our favorite way of letting you know what's going on in our lives.

171
00:22:28,304 --> 00:22:29,925
[SPEAKER_21]: It sounds like Jamie wants to start.

172
00:22:30,526 --> 00:22:32,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God, that gives me a headache.

173
00:22:32,507 --> 00:22:34,268
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie, how was your past two weeks?

174
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:36,870
[SPEAKER_21]: You were out last week for sickness.

175
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:37,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.

176
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:38,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Thursday.

177
00:22:39,112 --> 00:22:40,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, how long have you been sick now?

178
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:41,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Like three weeks?

179
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:41,913
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

180
00:22:42,014 --> 00:22:42,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have SARS?

181
00:22:43,074 --> 00:22:43,515
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

182
00:22:43,535 --> 00:22:43,575
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

183
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:53,134
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I was, I was starting to get sick around Wednesday-ish, and Thursday, um, Dan's like, hey, let's go out and have dinner and shit, and so I'm like, okay.

184
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:54,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, you had dinner and shit?

185
00:22:54,614 --> 00:22:55,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

186
00:22:55,655 --> 00:22:56,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything makes you shit.

187
00:22:58,056 --> 00:22:58,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

188
00:22:58,676 --> 00:22:59,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Not soup.

189
00:23:03,158 --> 00:23:04,339
[SPEAKER_07]: With my digestion.

190
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:05,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

191
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

192
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,921
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be like chunky, creamy cheese soup or something.

193
00:23:09,981 --> 00:23:10,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on!

194
00:23:10,582 --> 00:23:11,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

195
00:23:12,002 --> 00:23:12,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

196
00:23:16,614 --> 00:23:18,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, could you repeat that revelation for our listeners?

197
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:23,116
[SPEAKER_03]: The beef soup makes your urine smell like beef.

198
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:25,197
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fact.

199
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:26,477
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like honey smacks.

200
00:23:26,817 --> 00:23:29,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Honey smacks makes your urine smell like honey smacks.

201
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,580
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quite fascinating.

202
00:23:36,921 --> 00:23:38,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Honeycomb, honeycomb, we want honeycomb.

203
00:23:39,661 --> 00:23:40,782
[SPEAKER_03]: A honeycomb doesn't do anything.

204
00:23:40,942 --> 00:23:43,523
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just honey smacks and beef soup.

205
00:23:43,663 --> 00:23:44,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

206
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:49,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's also like the blue Hawaiian punch makes you urine green.

207
00:23:49,472 --> 00:23:50,092
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of weird.

208
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:58,058
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like, if you were to eat, like, beef soup with honey smacks on the side, would your, like, urine turn into this sudden, like, stink bomb?

209
00:23:58,118 --> 00:24:01,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you could just, like, you know, whip it out?

210
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:01,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Pow!

211
00:24:02,501 --> 00:24:04,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what about my week?

212
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:05,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

213
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:06,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

214
00:24:07,264 --> 00:24:08,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Freaking piss sniffers.

215
00:24:11,047 --> 00:24:11,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

216
00:24:11,907 --> 00:24:12,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

217
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:21,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's different for a woman because you sit when you pee so you don't really smell it because it's kind of contained in the potty, right?

218
00:24:21,748 --> 00:24:22,408
[SPEAKER_03]: The smell is right.

219
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:26,310
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're a guy, you're whipping it out and you pee right there.

220
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,712
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

221
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:32,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying.

222
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:32,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying.

223
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:33,814
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't help it.

224
00:24:34,294 --> 00:24:34,554
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

225
00:24:34,814 --> 00:24:38,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut the fuck up.

226
00:24:38,756 --> 00:24:40,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I seriously think that's why some guys sit when they pee.

227
00:24:43,462 --> 00:24:44,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

228
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:46,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone here in the studio does have their pants on.

229
00:24:47,425 --> 00:24:49,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the hell they're talking about.

230
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:50,788
We can fix that.

231
00:24:51,848 --> 00:24:53,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey now, what the hell is that big black scratch?

232
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, Bradley sort of looks like he's not wearing pants in the webcam.

233
00:24:56,772 --> 00:24:57,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Your head's in the cam.

234
00:25:00,034 --> 00:25:00,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Jamie.

235
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:04,998
[SPEAKER_21]: You okay?

236
00:25:05,498 --> 00:25:06,819
[SPEAKER_21]: You sure you want to talk about your week here?

237
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,520
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

238
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,222
[SPEAKER_21]: You want something to drink?

239
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:11,323
[SPEAKER_21]: You want some honey smacks?

240
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:12,844
[SPEAKER_21]: Ouch!

241
00:25:15,518 --> 00:25:18,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I had beef soup, but now all I have is, like, chicken soup.

242
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:26,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fucking go in the bathroom and take a pee right now, because I'm sick of hearing about your urine, okay?

243
00:25:28,887 --> 00:25:29,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay?

244
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:36,132
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have to pee, stop talking about it, just get in the bathroom and pee.

245
00:25:37,353 --> 00:25:41,676
[SPEAKER_03]: We have so many Jamie quotes in, like, the past, like, two minutes right there to use in the next intro.

246
00:25:43,653 --> 00:25:46,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to mention that the blue light turns your stool green also.

247
00:25:46,555 --> 00:25:50,258
[SPEAKER_06]: You are in the perfect position for me to just knock you right out of your chair.

248
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:52,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that would be my chair.

249
00:25:53,861 --> 00:25:55,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Knock you right out of Loki's chair.

250
00:25:55,282 --> 00:25:55,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

251
00:25:55,742 --> 00:25:58,364
[SPEAKER_06]: And you, I could throw the ferret at you, but that's too much effort.

252
00:25:59,185 --> 00:25:59,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

253
00:25:59,585 --> 00:25:59,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

254
00:26:00,766 --> 00:26:01,206
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your week?

255
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:01,646
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your day?

256
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:04,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I had two weeks, and I was sick the whole time.

257
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:06,210
[SPEAKER_06]: It's...

258
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:13,951
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess as everyone can tell, I still have this nasty cough.

259
00:26:14,672 --> 00:26:27,618
[SPEAKER_06]: And last week, when I called in, as you can probably vouch for this, I sounded really shitty, and I was getting dizzy in my chair, and I ran fever all weekend, I ran fever at work, but it's nothing that's like super contagious, it's a sinus infection.

260
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:34,802
[SPEAKER_06]: But I didn't know that time I thought that I had like leukemia and emphysema at the same time.

261
00:26:35,322 --> 00:26:37,383
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Dan thought I had emphysema, that was funny.

262
00:26:37,844 --> 00:26:38,184
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like...

263
00:26:38,914 --> 00:26:41,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Who was mistaking emphysema for bronchitis?

264
00:26:42,756 --> 00:26:44,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't emphysema something smokers get?

265
00:26:44,537 --> 00:26:44,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

266
00:26:44,877 --> 00:26:46,878
[SPEAKER_03]: And you quit quite some years ago, didn't you?

267
00:26:46,918 --> 00:26:47,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Five and a half years ago.

268
00:26:47,838 --> 00:26:49,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so that's weird.

269
00:26:53,140 --> 00:27:05,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so all the snot in my nose that's been consistently draining since I had this infection start has been going right into my lungs.

270
00:27:06,506 --> 00:27:08,247
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I've been, of course, coughing it all back up

271
00:27:09,153 --> 00:27:11,054
[SPEAKER_06]: I sound like I'm going to die every moment.

272
00:27:12,454 --> 00:27:20,578
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I got over all the nasty, you know, fevery, shakes, all those symptoms, but I cough myself into headaches now, which sucks.

273
00:27:21,678 --> 00:27:22,459
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a headache right now.

274
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:30,642
[SPEAKER_06]: So it got bad enough that Tuesday when I was doing laundry, I stopped breathing for like a little bit.

275
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:31,462
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to go lay down.

276
00:27:33,563 --> 00:27:37,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I took like three puffs off my Ibuterol, laid down,

277
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:42,029
[SPEAKER_06]: It felt better finishing my laundry, but I called the doctor the next day.

278
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,631
[SPEAKER_06]: So they gave me more asthma medicine that night.

279
00:27:45,632 --> 00:27:51,417
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they said, I get a call the next day that says, either come into the doctor or if we can't schedule you, go to the emergency room.

280
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:55,020
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, okay, oh shit, that's like pretty, pretty bad.

281
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,561
[SPEAKER_06]: So I went to the doctor.

282
00:27:57,461 --> 00:27:59,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Turns out I had sinus infection, drainage.

283
00:28:02,464 --> 00:28:04,406
[SPEAKER_06]: and then they prescribed me more drugs.

284
00:28:04,946 --> 00:28:09,930
[SPEAKER_06]: So now I'm on an antibiotic and I'm on Robitussin with codeine.

285
00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:11,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Robitussin.

286
00:28:11,531 --> 00:28:12,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Robitussin.

287
00:28:14,998 --> 00:28:20,161
[SPEAKER_06]: And I swear at night that, okay, you know me and my insane tolerance for alcohol.

288
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:22,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Coding will just totally screw my head up.

289
00:28:22,923 --> 00:28:24,084
[SPEAKER_06]: So I take it before bed.

290
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:28,947
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm really groggy when I wake up in the morning and dizzy and all kinds of fun stuff.

291
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:30,308
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm on all kinds of drugs now.

292
00:28:31,288 --> 00:28:34,710
[SPEAKER_06]: And on top of that, my voice sounds really crappy at work in a call center.

293
00:28:35,451 --> 00:28:38,712
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'm hoping that I get over this crap before I go to Alabama.

294
00:28:39,713 --> 00:28:42,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, to, that's next Tuesday.

295
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be on a plane next Tuesday.

296
00:28:46,817 --> 00:28:50,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so that's also why I sound really crappy.

297
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,442
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm about to, you know, spew up one of my lungs on your carpet.

298
00:28:56,742 --> 00:28:57,823
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can put it on the webcam.

299
00:29:03,266 --> 00:29:04,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, feel better soon.

300
00:29:04,887 --> 00:29:12,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that kind of sucks that you have to go back to work tomorrow and talk, but on the bright side, maybe, you know, it'll build something up, the talking.

301
00:29:12,612 --> 00:29:13,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how that works.

302
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:18,616
[SPEAKER_06]: You have no idea how gross it is.

303
00:29:20,564 --> 00:29:28,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I can kind of imagine, because I know that, you know, as somebody in my position, I have to talk a lot of times all day long, too, when I'm teaching.

304
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I talk loud, too, because I'm teaching.

305
00:29:30,231 --> 00:29:42,100
[SPEAKER_03]: And usually, if I go for a while, like if we're in between classes and I'm not talking a lot loud, and it takes me a little while those first couple days when I get back into class, where I have to kind of build up my voice again, so...

306
00:29:49,853 --> 00:29:51,874
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about actually coughing up everything.

307
00:29:51,934 --> 00:29:52,574
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really gross.

308
00:29:54,915 --> 00:29:59,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily, I haven't had to go through being sick and trying to do all that yet, but who knows?

309
00:29:59,396 --> 00:29:59,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe someday.

310
00:30:01,857 --> 00:30:03,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so let's move on.

311
00:30:04,317 --> 00:30:05,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk to Bradley.

312
00:30:06,718 --> 00:30:08,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley, how was your day and how was your week?

313
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:09,859
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I'm sitting on the cord.

314
00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:11,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, we'll give you a little more room there.

315
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,180
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

316
00:30:15,081 --> 00:30:15,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Tear each cord.

317
00:30:17,372 --> 00:30:19,554
[SPEAKER_03]: That's as long as you're going to get to go.

318
00:30:19,574 --> 00:30:20,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I have the long one.

319
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:22,796
[SPEAKER_22]: There we go.

320
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:24,917
[SPEAKER_22]: Now it's all untangled.

321
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:27,739
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, this week not too much happened.

322
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,881
[SPEAKER_22]: Sat around most of the day doing not much.

323
00:30:31,321 --> 00:30:37,885
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, actually I shipped out like 20 or so packages to various places in the U.S.

324
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,526
[SPEAKER_22]: and six other countries.

325
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:57,834
[SPEAKER_22]: On Tuesday, I finally went by Fireside Lanes, which is like a mile from where I live, so I went and checked out their DDR Extreme, and it's in pretty good shape, so I played two games then, and then went back on Thursday and played six.

326
00:30:59,975 --> 00:31:04,116
[SPEAKER_22]: And now my foot hurts from all that stomping.

327
00:31:06,637 --> 00:31:07,317
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see, what else?

328
00:31:09,495 --> 00:31:19,462
[SPEAKER_22]: and yesterday I fixed up my 2DX controller a bit so I can actually play some 2DX for the first time at home for the first time in like two months.

329
00:31:19,702 --> 00:31:22,404
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I haven't played 2DX at home in a long time.

330
00:31:22,825 --> 00:31:31,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really hoping that, well, I mean maybe we'll talk about it later, but I'm just hoping that there is in fact a new consumer style coming out and yes, I know they got all the signatures and da-da-da-da-da.

331
00:31:32,311 --> 00:31:32,992
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll address it later.

332
00:31:33,032 --> 00:31:36,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I just really hope it happens and they don't try to dick us somehow.

333
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:38,796
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

334
00:31:40,225 --> 00:31:41,325
[SPEAKER_03]: It better not suck, too.

335
00:31:41,665 --> 00:31:44,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Considering we've had to wait like a year and a half at least, if not two years.

336
00:31:44,506 --> 00:31:48,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not have to wait two years for this new 2DX, basically, from the time we got the last one.

337
00:31:48,967 --> 00:31:53,828
[SPEAKER_03]: If it sucks, Konami can, like, just go to hell.

338
00:31:54,028 --> 00:31:54,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

339
00:31:55,268 --> 00:31:55,748
[SPEAKER_03]: It better be good.

340
00:31:55,768 --> 00:31:57,709
[SPEAKER_03]: It better have like 300 songs on it.

341
00:31:59,709 --> 00:31:59,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

342
00:32:00,649 --> 00:32:01,209
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, man.

343
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:06,310
[SPEAKER_22]: And then... Let's see, what else?

344
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,531
[SPEAKER_22]: If anything happened... Uh...

345
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,411
[SPEAKER_22]: Not really much else happened.

346
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:19,635
[SPEAKER_22]: Played more 2DX today and passed a few new things.

347
00:32:20,256 --> 00:32:24,419
[SPEAKER_22]: That was like played a few courses and passed a few new ones.

348
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,501
[SPEAKER_22]: That's about everything that happened this week.

349
00:32:31,584 --> 00:32:32,845
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, on to someone else.

350
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:38,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your day?

351
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,010
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your week?

352
00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:42,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, didn't do anything today except for work on my cabinet a little bit.

353
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,391
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's coming along quite well.

354
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:47,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on my last sheet of stuff to cut out.

355
00:32:49,132 --> 00:32:53,033
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only thing that's holding me back is the damn battery power in the jigsaw.

356
00:32:53,793 --> 00:32:55,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, otherwise I would have been done today.

357
00:32:56,154 --> 00:33:01,915
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, once it's all cut out, which will be this week, I will start putting it together.

358
00:33:03,176 --> 00:33:07,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And then comes the wonderful job of finding out where we're going to put it.

359
00:33:10,403 --> 00:33:10,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

360
00:33:10,984 --> 00:33:11,484
[SPEAKER_03]: No, anyways.

361
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:14,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Earlier this week... I said we just get rid of the couch.

362
00:33:15,928 --> 00:33:24,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, what I was thinking is that we move that small chair somewhere, put the couch against the window, put the cabinet where her chair is.

363
00:33:26,118 --> 00:33:27,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, obviously, the...

364
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,251
[SPEAKER_03]: You okay?

365
00:33:30,271 --> 00:33:31,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

366
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:35,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously the camera would be on top of the cabinet sitting somewhere.

367
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,944
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, I don't know, figure out where to put the other chairs.

368
00:33:40,865 --> 00:33:42,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe burn that or something.

369
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:43,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, figure it out.

370
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:44,289
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

371
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:56,456
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, then today, before the show, as you might have seen on the webcam if you're watching, I was calibrating the TV to look nicer, which I don't really notice anything, but whatever.

372
00:33:56,997 --> 00:34:01,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I noticed that the chat room's more readable than usual, except when people use colors.

373
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:05,141
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um...

374
00:34:06,909 --> 00:34:20,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so we were watching that and said, do not go beyond your abilities or something and showed someone like trying to pry off something on a circuit board and getting electrocuted and then the house started getting electrocuted and then it burst into flames.

375
00:34:20,746 --> 00:34:24,310
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great because the house caught on fire and we had laughed.

376
00:34:25,491 --> 00:34:28,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, um... What else?

377
00:34:29,054 --> 00:34:29,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, not much.

378
00:34:29,674 --> 00:34:31,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I ordered the rest of my parts for my cabinet.

379
00:34:32,316 --> 00:34:35,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I ordered my buttons for popping music, so those are coming.

380
00:34:36,479 --> 00:34:38,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Along with my bezel for the monitor.

381
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,522
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a little black thing that goes around it so it doesn't look like a TV.

382
00:34:41,562 --> 00:34:43,183
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks more like an actual monitor.

383
00:34:43,844 --> 00:34:47,746
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, um... Yeah, it should be coming together pretty fast.

384
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:51,269
[SPEAKER_03]: So... That's about it.

385
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:52,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

386
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:53,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too much.

387
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:54,871
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

388
00:34:55,711 --> 00:34:57,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and saw Scary Movie 3 this weekend.

389
00:34:58,212 --> 00:34:58,852
[SPEAKER_03]: That was funny.

390
00:34:58,892 --> 00:35:00,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard it shattered like a gazillion records.

391
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:01,473
[SPEAKER_03]: How was it?

392
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,114
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty good.

393
00:35:03,254 --> 00:35:10,656
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just, you know, like you hear the names like Airplane and Naked Gun, and your expectations are high on what the movie's supposed to be.

394
00:35:11,116 --> 00:35:12,037
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was good.

395
00:35:12,137 --> 00:35:12,957
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really funny.

396
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:15,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like the first movie that I've seen in a long time.

397
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:17,499
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually made me laugh out loud in the movie theater.

398
00:35:19,398 --> 00:35:23,219
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, a lot of the jokes were ruined from the previews.

399
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,921
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's why I didn't want to watch those clips, because I knew it would ruin the movie.

400
00:35:28,201 --> 00:35:29,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, no, no, not those.

401
00:35:29,501 --> 00:35:30,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about like the previews.

402
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:33,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Like one of the funniest ones, like the Michael Jackson thing, you know.

403
00:35:33,623 --> 00:35:34,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see.

404
00:35:34,403 --> 00:35:35,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Like stuff like that.

405
00:35:35,143 --> 00:35:36,064
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was good.

406
00:35:36,244 --> 00:35:36,504
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good.

407
00:35:36,684 --> 00:35:36,924
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

408
00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:37,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

409
00:35:38,684 --> 00:35:40,565
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's it.

410
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:41,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing else to say about your week?

411
00:35:41,505 --> 00:35:41,545
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

412
00:35:42,126 --> 00:35:42,406
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

413
00:35:44,266 --> 00:35:44,926
[SPEAKER_03]: My week and my day.

414
00:35:45,047 --> 00:35:47,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a pretty boring week, nothing too exciting.

415
00:35:48,108 --> 00:35:56,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've kind of gotten sick of going to Golf Land to play F-Zero and all that, because, I don't know, F-Zero, now that I've unlocked pretty much everything, it's kind of like lost its flair a little bit.

416
00:35:57,091 --> 00:36:03,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's still a fun game, and it's way better than Initial D, but I'm just kind of bored with it now.

417
00:36:04,554 --> 00:36:10,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, what's weird about Golf Land, the local arcade that a lot of us play at, is that they now have...

418
00:36:11,343 --> 00:36:17,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Two Initial D machines for a total of four cars to play Initial D with.

419
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:19,521
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

420
00:36:41,981 --> 00:36:45,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then DDR Extreme's still cool, I guess.

421
00:36:45,485 --> 00:36:47,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still trying to AAA stuff.

422
00:36:47,267 --> 00:36:50,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I got anything new this week, but, you know, I'm working on my heavy AAAs.

423
00:36:51,512 --> 00:36:54,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting a lot of single-digit grades, but no heavy AAAs, but I'm working there.

424
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:55,296
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working on it.

425
00:36:56,357 --> 00:36:58,279
[SPEAKER_03]: For some reason, I want my PA to get better.

426
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I'm ever going to be that great, but, you know, I can try.

427
00:37:01,282 --> 00:37:01,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

428
00:37:05,149 --> 00:37:10,254
[SPEAKER_03]: And then pretty much I've been working on my game of Final Fantasy X. I won't spoil where I'm at.

429
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:11,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't give a spoiler.

430
00:37:11,695 --> 00:37:14,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just say I'm at Mount... What the hell is it called?

431
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Mount Gagazil, I think it's called.

432
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:18,661
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I'm at right now, so for those of you who play the game.

433
00:37:20,663 --> 00:37:26,067
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think by my estimations I'm probably about a halfway, somewhere between halfway and two-thirds through it.

434
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:39,175
[SPEAKER_03]: So, still got a ways to go, and I'm trying to burn through it before Final Fantasy XI comes out on Wednesday, except I don't see that really happening, because I've got Vanilla Sky tomorrow night, and then Final Fantasy XI comes out Wednesday.

435
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:42,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the interesting thing is, I work a short week next week.

436
00:37:42,897 --> 00:37:45,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm only working Monday and Tuesday, because I have three days off.

437
00:37:45,379 --> 00:37:50,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm supposed to go to Hollywood for Halloween, but I foresee that the trip might be canceled.

438
00:37:50,321 --> 00:37:51,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to find out for sure tonight.

439
00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:52,823
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if the trip ends up getting canceled...

440
00:37:53,223 --> 00:37:53,684
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

441
00:38:09,398 --> 00:38:11,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I've kind of been staying away from information on the game.

442
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I've looked at the benchmark.

443
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I've looked at the demo.

444
00:38:14,761 --> 00:38:16,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched Brad Lanky's style.

445
00:38:16,923 --> 00:38:19,504
[SPEAKER_03]: If you listen to Vanilla Sky, he's on there a lot.

446
00:38:21,005 --> 00:38:24,047
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a beta tester for Final Fantasy XI, so I saw it a little bit over there.

447
00:38:24,107 --> 00:38:29,970
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than that, I've really been kind of just keeping it a surprise what all is going to wait for me in Final Fantasy XI.

448
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't read up on the classes or anything, so...

449
00:38:33,232 --> 00:38:34,013
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be exciting.

450
00:38:34,093 --> 00:38:37,518
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is, is that come Wednesday, I want to make sure I get the game.

451
00:38:37,558 --> 00:38:39,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I want to be one of the first people with the game.

452
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I want to make sure the name I want doesn't fucking get taken.

453
00:38:41,683 --> 00:38:43,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I hate that shit when people steal my name.

454
00:38:44,446 --> 00:38:45,047
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my name.

455
00:38:45,107 --> 00:38:45,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Back off!

456
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a radio show and you don't.

457
00:38:48,732 --> 00:38:49,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, I'm entitled to the name.

458
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:54,462
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's pretty much it.

459
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:57,404
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of just anticipating my vacation next week.

460
00:38:57,444 --> 00:38:57,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

461
00:38:58,145 --> 00:38:59,987
[SPEAKER_03]: And then not a whole lot too exciting this week.

462
00:39:00,067 --> 00:39:02,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been to play 2DX in like six weeks.

463
00:39:02,028 --> 00:39:03,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been to Scandia in a while.

464
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Golfland and playing stuff here.

465
00:39:06,352 --> 00:39:07,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Playing Castlevania.

466
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki bought the new Castlevania game.

467
00:39:10,256 --> 00:39:11,557
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll talk more about that tomorrow night.

468
00:39:12,277 --> 00:39:12,718
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm an else guy.

469
00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:16,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I think we're going to go to a break.

470
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:22,211
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we come back, we'll talk about some more news and some things going on in the Milani world.

471
00:39:22,251 --> 00:39:24,451
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe we'll do the news story next.

472
00:39:24,911 --> 00:39:29,232
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a news story that aired locally here in Sacramento, California, where we all live.

473
00:39:29,832 --> 00:39:30,892
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's comedy.

474
00:39:31,292 --> 00:39:37,614
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys definitely want to stay tuned and listen for this because we're going to play it for you guys and make fun of it because that's what we do.

475
00:39:38,574 --> 00:39:42,875
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back after a set of some five-key Beatmania songs.

476
00:39:42,915 --> 00:39:43,375
[SPEAKER_03]: This should be fun.

477
00:39:44,202 --> 00:39:45,050
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be right back.

[SPEAKER_00]: And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

481
00:44:01,212 --> 00:44:07,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

[SPEAKER_03]: Dance Dance Revolution and this aired on our local affiliate Channel 31 here in Sacramento and we wanted to play the story for you so you can see what the real people out there have to say about DDR so we're going to fire up the clip here and we will be of course stopping it and interjecting our own snide comments occasionally so here we go we're just waiting for it to load are you going to put it on TV so Jamie can see too?

488
00:45:22,614 --> 00:45:23,595

[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, you're going to have to come here if you want to see it, otherwise you have to just listen.

490
00:45:28,772 --> 00:45:30,672
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think of video games, what comes to mind?

491
00:45:31,072 --> 00:45:33,593
[SPEAKER_01]: The joystick, the chair, the set of steady eyes.

492
00:45:33,973 --> 00:45:34,453
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not very loud.

493
00:45:34,473 --> 00:45:34,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you turn it up?

494
00:45:34,993 --> 00:45:39,634
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the home version on PlayStation right now of DDR, which we talked about at the top of the show.

495
00:45:39,674 --> 00:45:43,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Because gone are the days of Pac-Man fever, the Donkey Kong craze.

496
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:46,395
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an interactive video that swept the nation.

497
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:48,515
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not for couch potatoes.

498
00:45:48,895 --> 00:45:53,776
[SPEAKER_01]: And GES's Tara Moriarty is shaking her groove saying it's John's Incredible Pizza in Stockton.

499
00:45:53,836 --> 00:45:55,176
[SPEAKER_01]: They're playing.

500
00:45:55,457 --> 00:45:56,977
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like two split screens.

501
00:45:56,997 --> 00:45:57,357
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got...

502
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:04,962
[SPEAKER_03]: They basically have Konomics playing in the background on a widescreen TV in the studio.

503
00:46:05,242 --> 00:46:10,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they got some dumb bitch on the spot in, what was it, John's Famous Pizza?

504
00:46:11,667 --> 00:46:14,970
[SPEAKER_03]: John's Incredible Pizza, which is pretty much like Chuck E. Cheese.

505
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:16,551
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got tons of rides and stuff.

506
00:46:17,032 --> 00:46:19,534
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually have carnival rides in there, which is pretty sweet.

507
00:46:21,395 --> 00:46:26,299
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're playing DDR Max 2 with all the employees who aren't working.

508
00:46:32,861 --> 00:46:40,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Justin Timberlake They're having a dance-off There's two employees on the machine playing something on basic He's been doing the machine

509
00:46:59,222 --> 00:47:01,465
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're really good.

510
00:47:02,025 --> 00:47:02,546
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I am.

511
00:47:03,427 --> 00:47:04,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Pause it, pause it, pause it.

512
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:06,811
[SPEAKER_03]: What a conceited little bastard.

513
00:47:07,912 --> 00:47:09,073
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hear you're good at DDR.

514
00:47:09,233 --> 00:47:10,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yes, I am actually.

515
00:47:12,117 --> 00:47:14,840
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I would have loved to have been there to kick his ass.

516
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:18,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody else I know, they're not talking to the person on the machine.

517
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:19,815
[SPEAKER_03]: They're talking to some guy off the machine.

518
00:47:19,835 --> 00:47:21,076
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to see him play at the end of the story.

519
00:47:21,096 --> 00:47:22,816
[SPEAKER_03]: But everybody else I know that plays DDR.

520
00:47:23,256 --> 00:47:25,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody that's good in tournaments and stuff like that, it's like this thing.

521
00:47:26,217 --> 00:47:27,778
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't get me wrong, this thing bugs me too.

522
00:47:27,858 --> 00:47:30,059
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, you ask somebody if they're good at DDR.

523
00:47:30,099 --> 00:47:34,800
[SPEAKER_03]: You could be talking to somebody who comes in like top three in tournaments and they'll go, yeah, I'm okay.

524
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:35,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm okay.

525
00:47:35,881 --> 00:47:36,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I play it sometimes.

526
00:47:37,241 --> 00:47:42,323
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like sometimes DDR community is just like over-humblefied.

527
00:47:42,343 --> 00:47:42,903
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

528
00:47:44,438 --> 00:47:49,939
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody asks me how good I am at DDR, I'm going to say, well, let me just put it this way, I kind of used to play it a lot.

529
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's more my response.

530
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I just say, I haven't played for a few years.

531
00:47:55,881 --> 00:47:56,861
[SPEAKER_03]: I've practiced a lot.

532
00:47:58,022 --> 00:47:58,582
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, move on.

533
00:48:01,362 --> 00:48:02,283
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you have to hit play.

534
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:02,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have to hit play.

535
00:48:05,206 --> 00:48:06,949
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, who does this?

536
00:48:07,189 --> 00:48:09,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, old people, young people?

537
00:48:09,212 --> 00:48:10,194
[SPEAKER_20]: Everybody now and then.

538
00:48:10,214 --> 00:48:12,958
[SPEAKER_20]: They come, they try, and they really have fun on this game.

539
00:48:13,038 --> 00:48:15,361
[SPEAKER_20]: Even if they're not good, they can really dance.

540
00:48:15,942 --> 00:48:16,463
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the key?

541
00:48:16,663 --> 00:48:18,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think it's really difficult.

542
00:48:19,486 --> 00:48:25,151
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, the key is to listen to the beat and just watch the arrows go from bottom to top and hit the corresponding step.

543
00:48:25,872 --> 00:48:27,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and so what are these two doing right now?

544
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,055
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing like the light version.

545
00:48:29,075 --> 00:48:31,437
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do heavy, moderate, or light.

546
00:48:31,477 --> 00:48:34,020
[SPEAKER_20]: There's three difficulty settings.

547
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,322
[SPEAKER_20]: There's light, standard, and heavy.

548
00:48:36,923 --> 00:48:42,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're going to cut over to Lloyd and Beth so we can see how they are stacking up against this competition here.

549
00:48:42,948 --> 00:48:43,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take a look.

550
00:48:44,378 --> 00:48:45,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you guys ready?

551
00:48:45,439 --> 00:48:47,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, Tara, we're picking our song.

552
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:47,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Pause it.

553
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:56,304
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay, so they're having this dance-off, quote-unquote, between the people playing in the arcade and then the two hosts in the studio.

554
00:48:57,313 --> 00:49:04,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how the fuck that works, but they're having a dance-off, which means we're going to make asses of ourselves all at the same time on this game.

555
00:49:04,558 --> 00:49:06,579
[SPEAKER_06]: He looks completely unenthusiastic.

556
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:11,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, these people have no, they don't need to be touching this software at all.

557
00:49:12,043 --> 00:49:18,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is why old people, I'm sure these guys aren't touching the software, that's what interns are for.

558
00:49:18,767 --> 00:49:22,830
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I used to be an intern at a television station, trust me, that's what the interns are there for.

559
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,271
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys don't have to know shit about the game.

560
00:49:26,389 --> 00:49:27,210
[SPEAKER_03]: They're fucking stupid.

561
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:31,354
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, let's watch and laugh at them as they make an ass of themselves.

562
00:49:31,794 --> 00:49:34,497
[SPEAKER_06]: And in response, yeah, they were playing the whistle song at the beginning.

563
00:49:34,517 --> 00:49:36,259
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to pick the maniac level.

564
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:37,580
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

565
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Basic.

566
00:49:39,382 --> 00:49:40,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Use your arms with me.

567
00:49:40,442 --> 00:49:41,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, you're a big boy.

568
00:49:41,784 --> 00:49:42,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Just bounce.

569
00:49:42,484 --> 00:49:42,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Just bounce.

570
00:49:42,965 --> 00:49:43,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, ready?

571
00:49:44,086 --> 00:49:44,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Left.

572
00:49:44,847 --> 00:49:45,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Left.

573
00:49:46,788 --> 00:49:50,270
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy is not even looking at the screen and they're playing dive.

574
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:51,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Pause it, pause it.

575
00:50:05,191 --> 00:50:05,671
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

576
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:37,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Turned around and bitch-slapped her and said, Stop it!

577
00:50:37,513 --> 00:50:40,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm making a big ass out of myself on television as it is.

578
00:50:40,116 --> 00:50:40,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave me alone.

579
00:50:42,238 --> 00:50:44,139
[SPEAKER_03]: And... Move on.

580
00:50:44,179 --> 00:50:45,300
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll give you the link to the video at the end.

581
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and look, they failed.

582
00:50:48,823 --> 00:50:49,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Pause.

583
00:50:49,323 --> 00:50:49,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Pause.

584
00:50:50,324 --> 00:50:52,725
[SPEAKER_03]: It took them a whopping 15 seconds to fail dive.

585
00:50:52,765 --> 00:50:59,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever decided to pick a four-foot song for these two incompetent hosts to play on the start, that was a bad mistake.

586
00:50:59,648 --> 00:51:00,989
[SPEAKER_06]: That intern is so fired.

587
00:51:01,249 --> 00:51:02,950
[SPEAKER_03]: That intern is so genius.

588
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:04,991
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I fucking hate those bastards.

589
00:51:05,011 --> 00:51:06,512
[SPEAKER_03]: They make me do all their fucking workflow.

590
00:51:06,712 --> 00:51:08,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make them look like fools on TV.

591
00:51:10,054 --> 00:51:14,179
[SPEAKER_03]: And now the male host is so shocked that he failed, he has Sylvester Stallone face.

592
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:17,362
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got like, oh, Adrian, I fucked up.

593
00:51:17,502 --> 00:51:20,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, the employees are still going at it.

594
00:51:20,846 --> 00:51:24,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, the employees are still going at it on the whistle song and not working.

595
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:27,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

596
00:51:28,675 --> 00:51:38,579
[SPEAKER_04]: So now the female host is asserting her authority and just yanking the other two employees off the machine and letting the third employee, who happens to be a DDR maniac here, put in his coin.

597
00:51:57,651 --> 00:51:59,211
[SPEAKER_20]: And then you get to pick your own song.

598
00:51:59,331 --> 00:52:01,412
[SPEAKER_20]: Pick your own song, pick your own difficulty level.

599
00:52:01,632 --> 00:52:02,832
[SPEAKER_20]: Look, words in Japanese.

600
00:52:03,292 --> 00:52:05,693
[SPEAKER_20]: This game will give you the seizure.

601
00:52:05,733 --> 00:52:07,273
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Max 2, by the way.

602
00:52:07,853 --> 00:52:09,253
[SPEAKER_04]: You have about 20 seconds.

603
00:52:09,954 --> 00:52:10,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

604
00:52:10,134 --> 00:52:12,474
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to do the heaviest difficulty possible.

605
00:52:12,574 --> 00:52:14,555
[SPEAKER_04]: And this guy, I mean, this is like a workout.

606
00:52:14,615 --> 00:52:21,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you don't want to go to aerobic class or... So you go straight for Healing Vision Angelic Mix, because he's going to show how big his dick is right here on TV.

607
00:52:21,956 --> 00:52:22,976
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just fade out here, Beth.

608
00:52:22,996 --> 00:52:23,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Just catch this guy.

609
00:52:27,612 --> 00:52:32,835
[SPEAKER_03]: And he also picked the song where the woman's gonna have to stretch for like 20 seconds to fill this blank spot.

610
00:52:32,915 --> 00:52:33,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so fucking amazed.

611
00:52:46,084 --> 00:52:47,085
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see my reflection.

612
00:52:47,105 --> 00:52:47,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Pause it!

613
00:52:47,345 --> 00:52:47,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Pause it!

614
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:50,007
[SPEAKER_01]: God, she did not go dance, dance, dance.

615
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:58,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, she just said dance, dance, dance, revolution.

616
00:52:58,912 --> 00:53:02,294
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like either she read the teleprompter wrong or something happened.

617
00:53:02,935 --> 00:53:05,176
[SPEAKER_03]: You're playing dance, dance, dance, revolution.

618
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:11,520
[SPEAKER_03]: The sequel to dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, revolution, revolution.

619
00:53:15,888 --> 00:53:16,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Let the bitch finish.

620
00:53:19,849 --> 00:53:26,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Xbox is going to come out with a version that's DDR Ultra Mix, and the one we have in our studio is thanks to Jim and Suzanne Eckes.

621
00:53:26,952 --> 00:53:28,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and then that's it.

622
00:53:29,012 --> 00:53:29,552
[SPEAKER_03]: It just cuts off.

623
00:53:30,053 --> 00:53:31,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Notice I say nothing about Konomics in there.

624
00:53:32,173 --> 00:53:35,874
[SPEAKER_03]: They say nothing about, oh, Max 2 is out now and you can buy it.

625
00:53:36,074 --> 00:53:40,616
[SPEAKER_03]: This is further proof that Microsoft is trying to buy out the world with this stupid Xbox thing.

626
00:53:41,696 --> 00:53:47,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's another place, and we'll talk about this later in the show, where they have a huge advertisement for DDR on the Xbox.

627
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:51,187
[SPEAKER_03]: They say nothing about, oh, Max 2, available now.

628
00:53:51,267 --> 00:53:54,211
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about, no, the Xbox version's coming out.

629
00:53:54,251 --> 00:53:54,431
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

630
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,755
[SPEAKER_06]: When she said right at the beginning of the thing that she said for PlayStation 4.

631
00:53:58,641 --> 00:53:59,962
[SPEAKER_03]: But she was playing Kanonix.

632
00:54:00,262 --> 00:54:02,123
[SPEAKER_03]: She wasn't even playing what's available right now.

633
00:54:02,663 --> 00:54:10,867
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks to these two people who are probably interns or something that brought it in, I would have been like, oh, fuck this Yoshi bitch, man.

634
00:54:10,907 --> 00:54:13,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to fucking do doubles and kick his ass.

635
00:54:13,389 --> 00:54:17,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be like, oh, man, that makes me so wet and hot because he's so sexy.

636
00:54:17,751 --> 00:54:19,192
[SPEAKER_03]: He's better than that Asian man.

637
00:54:19,732 --> 00:54:21,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man, I want a piece of that.

638
00:54:22,245 --> 00:54:25,369
[SPEAKER_03]: and then it would have all been like, oh my god, he is so cool.

639
00:54:25,409 --> 00:54:26,109
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, Rob?

640
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:26,209
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

641
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:32,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we need to write them and say, hi, we host a radio station about the money and we think you're stupid.

642
00:54:34,098 --> 00:54:35,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Love, Orange Elves Radio.

643
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I will write that letter if you want me to.

644
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:42,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I will write that letter telling them, you know, that their article was... They should interview us.

645
00:54:42,307 --> 00:54:42,948
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, though?

646
00:54:44,747 --> 00:54:46,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we need to waste our time with it.

647
00:54:46,587 --> 00:54:47,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be honest with you.

648
00:54:47,748 --> 00:54:50,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, you know, let it be whatever.

649
00:54:50,169 --> 00:54:54,031
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got bigger fish to fry than trying to get our faces on UPN Network.

650
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:57,835
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

651
00:54:58,176 --> 00:55:06,001
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to watch that story and laugh at it yourself, the link is www.upn31.com.

652
00:55:06,082 --> 00:55:08,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And Telemore's Lounge Radio sent you.

653
00:55:08,103 --> 00:55:11,666
[SPEAKER_03]: The link there, by the way, is on the bottom right of the page.

654
00:55:12,126 --> 00:55:16,489
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, Beth and Lloyd cut a rug in a video game dance-off.

655
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:19,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Who fucking says cut a rug anymore?

656
00:55:19,812 --> 00:55:22,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I just ate Taco Bell and I've got to cut a rug right now.

657
00:55:22,934 --> 00:55:24,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello and welcome to the fifth piece.

658
00:55:29,179 --> 00:55:30,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man, I gotta cut a rug.

659
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, that's cut the cheese.

660
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:38,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever I hear cut a rug, it makes me think of farting, or queefing, probably.

661
00:55:39,482 --> 00:55:39,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew.

662
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta vibrate the rug a little bit.

663
00:55:43,383 --> 00:55:45,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Cutting a rug, isn't that like what porn stars do?

664
00:55:45,923 --> 00:55:50,724
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they get prepared for their videos, you know, they cut their rug and make sure the carpet's all trimmed.

665
00:55:50,745 --> 00:55:52,505
[SPEAKER_06]: That's called shaving their private area.

666
00:55:54,409 --> 00:55:56,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, cutting a rug doesn't make me think of dancing.

667
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:59,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, dancing and cutting a rug are, like, completely different.

668
00:56:00,051 --> 00:56:10,734
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, to cut a rug you have to be bent over and, like, actually, you know, cutting the rug with, like, a knife or something, whereas, you know, dancing you're gyrating about to music, so I don't get it.

669
00:56:11,915 --> 00:56:12,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid hippies.

670
00:56:15,874 --> 00:56:24,338
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're going to take a break, and when we come back, we're going to talk a little bit about an interesting... We'll come back and take scissors to your carpet here.

671
00:56:24,378 --> 00:56:27,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and we're going to cut the rug here in the studio when we get back.

672
00:56:27,659 --> 00:56:34,001
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we're done cutting the rug, we'll get into the Orange Lounge Cage Match, so make sure you're in the chat room so you can vote in tonight's Cage Match.

673
00:56:34,322 --> 00:56:42,765
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to talk about a really interesting location, probably, dare I say it, the most interesting place I've ever seen a DDR machine.

674
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:44,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think I've seen a unique...

675
00:56:46,247 --> 00:56:50,653
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about that when we come back.

676
00:56:51,955 --> 00:56:56,643
[SPEAKER_03]: This break, I think we're going to do some DDR Euro stuff.

677
00:56:56,903 --> 00:56:59,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do some music from... Let's just have some Eurobeat.

678
00:57:00,028 --> 00:57:00,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

679
00:57:00,871 --> 00:57:01,592
[SPEAKER_03]: You want Eurobeat?

680
00:57:01,612 --> 00:57:02,692
[SPEAKER_03]: You want Parapara music?

681
00:57:02,713 --> 00:57:04,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go for some Parapara.

682
00:57:04,294 --> 00:57:05,214
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we'll do that.

683
00:57:05,295 --> 00:57:07,156
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do God.

684
00:57:07,797 --> 00:57:09,038
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going to hate us for this one.

685
00:57:09,258 --> 00:57:11,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but no stylist is going to piss his pants.

686
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,461
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be short and painless, you guys.

687
00:57:14,322 --> 00:57:17,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we'll be back after some quick block of music from Parapara.

688
00:57:17,865 --> 00:57:18,325
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back.

689
00:57:18,405 --> 00:57:19,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Launch Radio.

690
00:57:20,607 --> 00:57:21,367
Parapara.

691
00:57:44,152 --> 00:57:45,074
Thank you for watching!

692
00:58:12,888 --> 00:58:14,093
Thank you for watching!

693
01:01:13,099 --> 01:01:14,313
Don't wait for me

694
01:03:25,296 --> 01:03:34,804
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge Radio Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

695
01:03:34,924 --> 01:03:38,748
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I believe we've been doing this show, what, 66 weeks now?

696
01:03:39,585 --> 01:03:44,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that is probably only the second time I can ever remember us doing a para-para music break.

697
01:03:44,889 --> 01:03:45,529
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

698
01:03:45,869 --> 01:03:46,030
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

699
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:47,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't help it when Eurobeat was on.

700
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:49,952
[SPEAKER_06]: I found myself starting to do part of that one.

701
01:03:50,713 --> 01:03:52,634
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my first para-para.

702
01:03:53,014 --> 01:03:56,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Those songs, by the way, for you guys tuning in that maybe don't know much about the game.

703
01:03:56,597 --> 01:03:57,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom Boom Fire was the first one.

704
01:03:57,858 --> 01:04:01,040
[SPEAKER_03]: That was probably, I think for most of us, the first para we learned.

705
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:01,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

706
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:02,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

707
01:04:20,172 --> 01:04:21,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Abra, Abra, Cadabra

708
01:04:35,279 --> 01:04:36,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Parapara songs are really cool.

709
01:04:36,699 --> 01:04:37,800
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like some of the better ones.

710
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:39,560
[SPEAKER_03]: And there needs to be more of them in 2DX.

711
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if 2DX just needs more songs, just take some from Parapara.

712
01:04:42,501 --> 01:04:44,982
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my early six stars was a Parapara song.

713
01:04:45,482 --> 01:04:50,423
[SPEAKER_06]: And my first seven star was a Eurobeat.

714
01:04:51,023 --> 01:04:55,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I believe it was... My first two sevens.

715
01:04:55,184 --> 01:04:55,845
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I take that back.

716
01:04:56,045 --> 01:05:02,626
[SPEAKER_06]: My second three... Out of the first three that I passed, the second and third ones were Eurobeat.

717
01:05:02,646 --> 01:05:02,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

718
01:05:03,627 --> 01:05:04,487
[SPEAKER_06]: My first one was Please Don't Go.

719
01:05:05,596 --> 01:05:07,137
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

720
01:05:24,842 --> 01:05:27,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll vouch for that.

721
01:05:28,003 --> 01:05:30,103
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been in the car with me with my Eurobeat.

722
01:05:30,223 --> 01:05:35,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a very safe, over-safe driver, and when I put that CD in, I go like 90 miles an hour.

723
01:05:36,364 --> 01:05:39,105
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been in the car with me with my Eurobeat.

724
01:05:40,745 --> 01:05:41,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember who I was with.

725
01:05:41,885 --> 01:05:43,626
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Ryan.

726
01:05:44,466 --> 01:05:48,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody said that I get all cool when I drive with Eurobeat.

727
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,247
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, what do you mean by cool?

728
01:05:50,267 --> 01:05:51,347
[SPEAKER_06]: He was like, aggressive.

729
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:54,060
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think happened with Parapara?

730
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to kind of ask this question to anybody who wants to answer it.

731
01:05:56,701 --> 01:05:57,701
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened with Parapara?

732
01:05:58,001 --> 01:05:58,742
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out.

733
01:05:59,302 --> 01:06:01,223
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the coolest fucking thing on the block.

734
01:06:01,783 --> 01:06:07,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wanted to go to Milpitas Golf Line to play Parapara because it was like, oh, it's like DDR, but it's your hands, okay?

735
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:08,631
[SPEAKER_03]: www.DarkSakura.com

736
01:06:29,537 --> 01:06:30,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

737
01:06:45,171 --> 01:06:46,672
[SPEAKER_03]: This all fucking sounds the same.

738
01:06:46,812 --> 01:06:47,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was it.

739
01:06:47,553 --> 01:06:48,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I was done with Parapara.

740
01:06:48,794 --> 01:06:51,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it was about the time it was released for the home version.

741
01:06:51,276 --> 01:06:56,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I taught myself, like, four Paraparas so I could, like, go to the arcade and blend in with a cool crowd.

742
01:06:57,001 --> 01:06:59,003
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I just didn't give a shit anymore.

743
01:06:59,203 --> 01:07:01,364
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't really care about anything, Parapara.

744
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:03,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember when RPGL got the Patapata machine.

745
01:07:03,586 --> 01:07:04,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that, too.

746
01:07:04,367 --> 01:07:09,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And there were people who were staring at that scratch in their butts going, Ugh, what do we do?

747
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:10,372
[SPEAKER_06]: And then...

748
01:07:11,337 --> 01:07:15,680
[SPEAKER_06]: We got up there and Rick ate the paper that says do not shadow.

749
01:07:15,941 --> 01:07:21,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, it was great because at Sunnyvale Golf Land, their machine used to have a big sign on it saying do not shadow.

750
01:07:21,885 --> 01:07:26,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you've been to Sunnyvale Golf Land, you can't fucking walk down the aisle if there's anybody standing in it, right?

751
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:28,751
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't want to have people standing there shadowing.

752
01:07:28,771 --> 01:07:33,114
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like this big thing too because Sunnyvale Golf Land is kind of where the backlash sort of began, I think.

753
01:07:33,634 --> 01:07:37,537
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of those people who think they're cooler than everybody else kind of started that whole thing.

754
01:07:38,098 --> 01:07:38,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And then...

755
01:07:39,899 --> 01:07:41,780
[SPEAKER_03]: They had the big sign on there that said, Don't Shadow.

756
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what ended up happening, that machine got moved from Sunnyvale to Roseville, Goughland.

757
01:07:44,822 --> 01:07:50,124
[SPEAKER_03]: The first day it came in, one of our regulars over there took the paper off the machine and ate it.

758
01:07:50,224 --> 01:07:51,145
[SPEAKER_03]: It was hilarious.

759
01:07:51,185 --> 01:07:52,825
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a picture of it hanging out of his mouth.

760
01:07:53,266 --> 01:07:58,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of a symbolic thing, like, kind of, screw you, we're going to do what we want.

761
01:07:58,748 --> 01:08:05,732
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember, it would usually be, I'd play, you'd shadow, and someone else would shadow, too.

762
01:08:07,132 --> 01:08:08,133
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the person would shadow.

763
01:08:09,972 --> 01:08:10,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Who else was it?

764
01:08:11,073 --> 01:08:11,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Anita?

765
01:08:12,334 --> 01:08:15,416
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this was when we first knew Anita.

766
01:08:15,476 --> 01:08:16,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

767
01:08:16,277 --> 01:08:18,239
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was a couple people.

768
01:08:19,019 --> 01:08:20,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the parents were funny.

769
01:08:21,161 --> 01:08:21,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

770
01:08:21,501 --> 01:08:25,504
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd be like, uh, we're stupid.

771
01:08:25,584 --> 01:08:26,325
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatcha do?

772
01:08:28,657 --> 01:08:32,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Some different theories from the chat room as to what happened to Parapara and why it's not cool anymore.

773
01:08:33,278 --> 01:08:36,019
[SPEAKER_03]: SnubDisanoid says, I think people saw themselves playing.

774
01:08:36,519 --> 01:08:37,339
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it ended.

775
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:42,001
[SPEAKER_03]: When somebody just saw themselves playing and went, God, I look like an ass.

776
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:47,362
[SPEAKER_03]: StablerX says, looks just like another passing Japanese trend.

777
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,883
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for me is I stopped going to RVGL.

778
01:08:51,644 --> 01:08:53,206
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big part of it too.

779
01:08:53,667 --> 01:08:54,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I played when we go to Miggle.

780
01:08:55,189 --> 01:08:55,689
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

781
01:08:55,729 --> 01:08:57,752
[SPEAKER_03]: People look stupid when they play DDR too.

782
01:08:57,872 --> 01:09:04,500
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if people seeing themselves playing is necessarily a turn off because you look just as stupid playing DDR.

783
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,443
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, like Dance Maniacs, that's the worst.

784
01:09:09,322 --> 01:09:12,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I love Dance Maniacs, and you know what?

785
01:09:12,305 --> 01:09:14,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fucking building a Dance Maniacs machine.

786
01:09:15,047 --> 01:09:18,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my machine covers everything, but Dance Maniacs is part of it, so there.

787
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:20,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, that's cool.

788
01:09:20,971 --> 01:09:24,294
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Dance Maniacs too, but you look like a total boob playing it.

789
01:09:24,374 --> 01:09:25,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's the thing.

790
01:09:25,875 --> 01:09:26,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Rob.

791
01:09:26,516 --> 01:09:27,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but it's fun.

792
01:09:27,516 --> 01:09:28,177
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.

793
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:28,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob.

794
01:09:29,358 --> 01:09:29,618
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

795
01:09:29,898 --> 01:09:30,899
[SPEAKER_03]: You said boob.

796
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:32,600
[SPEAKER_03]: I did say boob.

797
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:34,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

798
01:09:35,663 --> 01:09:35,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

799
01:09:37,557 --> 01:09:42,300
[SPEAKER_03]: SCDriftKing says, my DWI is equal to forearm exercise.

800
01:09:43,521 --> 01:09:45,302
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to know what my forearm exercise is.

801
01:09:46,863 --> 01:09:51,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I want to address DDRcolic's idea about what happened.

802
01:09:51,746 --> 01:09:56,328
[SPEAKER_03]: She says, I think what happened is all the haters started being haters and ruined it for everyone.

803
01:09:57,229 --> 01:10:02,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what I say, if haters are bothering you, you need to fight hate with hate.

804
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:04,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't stand for that shit.

805
01:10:05,063 --> 01:10:07,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Outnumber them and make fun of them.

806
01:10:07,588 --> 01:10:09,291
[SPEAKER_03]: That is how you're going to stop the haters.

807
01:10:09,531 --> 01:10:11,114
[SPEAKER_03]: You fight hate with hate.

808
01:10:12,457 --> 01:10:14,180
[SPEAKER_06]: We used to fight them with making fun of them.

809
01:10:15,074 --> 01:10:15,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember.

810
01:10:15,534 --> 01:10:16,035
[SPEAKER_03]: And it worked.

811
01:10:16,155 --> 01:10:21,697
[SPEAKER_03]: The people that make fun of DDR, we would totally, we would just like, we'd gang up on them, like some kind of geek gang.

812
01:10:21,978 --> 01:10:28,101
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd like all surround, remember the guy that made fun of me one night playing DDR, and then like ten of us, we all just kind of like jumped him, like sort of thing.

813
01:10:28,121 --> 01:10:30,362
[SPEAKER_03]: We were like, hey, you want to get up there and fight him, you know, play against him?

814
01:10:30,382 --> 01:10:31,442
[SPEAKER_03]: And he cried.

815
01:10:31,682 --> 01:10:33,103
[SPEAKER_03]: He ran to the bathroom and cried.

816
01:10:33,623 --> 01:10:34,764
[SPEAKER_03]: And you offered to pay for his game.

817
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:38,206
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's all those other people who I would just have thrown out.

818
01:10:39,346 --> 01:10:40,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Haha, guess what?

819
01:10:40,667 --> 01:10:42,568
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to make fun of us, then you don't get to play anything.

820
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:45,730
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

821
01:10:49,031 --> 01:10:59,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was because, you know, submitting, you know, kind of playing para para is kind of like almost just like converting over to being metrosexual.

822
01:10:59,674 --> 01:11:07,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that's why people weren't playing it because they're like, you know, afraid of the bright, shiny side, if you would like to call it that.

823
01:11:08,377 --> 01:11:12,578
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think would happen if you were to show that to the folks from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy?

824
01:11:14,292 --> 01:11:15,153
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never watched that show.

825
01:11:15,193 --> 01:11:16,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Crab people!

826
01:11:16,353 --> 01:11:20,096
[SPEAKER_03]: I think even the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy people would go, okay, that is too gay.

827
01:11:20,496 --> 01:11:21,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Get that out of your house.

828
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:22,017
[SPEAKER_03]: That's too gay.

829
01:11:22,518 --> 01:11:22,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Too gay.

830
01:11:23,658 --> 01:11:26,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you want to know what, though, before... It's going to be in this house.

831
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Before there was a pata pata.

832
01:11:28,402 --> 01:11:32,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Though, I don't know if you remember, but there's videos that I found way back when.

833
01:11:32,845 --> 01:11:33,665
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, the par videos.

834
01:11:34,085 --> 01:11:42,331
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the ones where they were demoing the game in Japan with the little girls with their flowery shirts doing the pata pata on the machine.

835
01:11:42,887 --> 01:11:47,409
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because the little Japanese girls are fucking hot and they're like, I'll do whatever you want.

836
01:11:47,769 --> 01:11:52,850
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also, you know, the guy, get that guy Bucky to fucking come over here and just like beat ass.

837
01:11:52,930 --> 01:11:57,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if he was like the main like star of the game, people would be just falling over that game.

838
01:11:59,012 --> 01:12:04,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Jumping backwards a little bit, about three people in the chat room because of the buffer are asking, what is metrosexual?

839
01:12:04,554 --> 01:12:12,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently you haven't watched South Park, but anyways, metrosexual is where you act gay, but you're not gay.

840
01:12:13,052 --> 01:12:16,574
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like being high in fashion stuff and that type of thing.

841
01:12:17,534 --> 01:12:20,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Metrosexual is being gay to get chicks.

842
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:26,338
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the thing where five years ago, make fun of gays, can them, all this stuff.

843
01:12:26,358 --> 01:12:30,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Trust me, I was afraid to come out for a long time because I didn't want to face this backlash.

844
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, five years later, if you're gay, you're cool.

845
01:12:35,114 --> 01:12:48,723
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, being metrosexual is being one of those guys that's kind of up there going, you know, on a date with some woman at a candlelight dinner, you know, yeah, you know, I blew a guy once, you know, just experimenting type thing, and that's supposed to, like, make him more attractive.

846
01:12:49,844 --> 01:12:52,646
[SPEAKER_06]: You know... I don't think it's that at all.

847
01:12:52,706 --> 01:12:56,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's better to be that than manual sexual.

848
01:12:57,669 --> 01:12:59,070
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just what that means.

849
01:13:00,691 --> 01:13:03,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, anyways, it's like, you know, I think it's just like, you know...

850
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:05,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, define it.

851
01:13:05,767 --> 01:13:07,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Manual has to do with using your hands.

852
01:13:09,689 --> 01:13:14,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, anyways, um, it's like, it's like, you know how smoking was cool back in the 90s and stuff?

853
01:13:15,011 --> 01:13:18,713
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like being gay is cool now in like the year 2000 and so on.

854
01:13:19,333 --> 01:13:22,174
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, next year it'll be like bestiality or something.

855
01:13:22,194 --> 01:13:23,515
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's fads.

856
01:13:24,535 --> 01:13:26,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey kids, be cool, fuck a sheep.

857
01:13:27,516 --> 01:13:28,477
[SPEAKER_07]: They're at sexual.

858
01:13:30,558 --> 01:13:31,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, um.

859
01:13:33,012 --> 01:13:33,473
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

860
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:51,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and now I'm being corrected on this too.

861
01:13:51,687 --> 01:13:55,652
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's metrosexual or metarosexual, it's either or.

862
01:13:55,672 --> 01:13:56,593
[SPEAKER_03]: They mean the same thing.

863
01:13:56,653 --> 01:13:59,157
[SPEAKER_03]: People say it either way because metro, hetero, get it?

864
01:13:59,357 --> 01:14:00,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Metro is like city.

865
01:14:00,639 --> 01:14:00,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, right.

866
01:14:01,039 --> 01:14:04,264
[SPEAKER_03]: A metro is kind of what it's supposed to be, but people say metro.

867
01:14:04,324 --> 01:14:06,367
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of formed into that.

868
01:14:09,156 --> 01:14:13,459
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying in the chat room Ben Affleck is a perfect definition of a metrosexual.

869
01:14:13,879 --> 01:14:18,423
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say more like Justin Timberlake is a perfect example of someone who's metrosexual.

870
01:14:18,683 --> 01:14:23,026
[SPEAKER_03]: He does all these really fucking gay things like being an NSYNC, right?

871
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:29,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so good she could never have another man after me.

872
01:14:29,741 --> 01:14:31,681
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why she's gone lesbian, and that's even harder.

873
01:14:53,709 --> 01:14:58,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so the moral of the story is, leave being gay to the gay people.

874
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:03,218
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, be accepting, but be straight, okay?

875
01:15:03,258 --> 01:15:04,078
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all we ask.

876
01:15:04,599 --> 01:15:10,224
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, going back to my live journal post about National Whatever Days, you know what?

877
01:15:10,244 --> 01:15:12,106
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to have National Blowjob Day.

878
01:15:12,126 --> 01:15:12,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

879
01:15:14,412 --> 01:15:19,675
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have all these like sex appreciation day, masturbation day.

880
01:15:20,355 --> 01:15:22,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they have a blowjob day somewhere on the calendar, Jamie.

881
01:15:22,816 --> 01:15:24,197
[SPEAKER_03]: You just don't have it penciled in.

882
01:15:25,497 --> 01:15:25,957
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

883
01:15:25,977 --> 01:15:27,258
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because they're gross.

884
01:15:29,139 --> 01:15:29,419
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

885
01:15:30,299 --> 01:15:31,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I will look it up.

886
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:34,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki is going to look up National Blowjob Day for you all.

887
01:15:34,221 --> 01:15:34,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

888
01:15:35,402 --> 01:15:36,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's shift gears a little bit.

889
01:15:36,602 --> 01:15:36,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

890
01:15:39,292 --> 01:15:42,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to ask a question to the chat room, going back to something actually Bomani related.

891
01:15:43,276 --> 01:15:47,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Send this to me over private message, by the way, because I'll read these later.

892
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear from people who aren't in Sacramento, first off.

893
01:15:50,983 --> 01:15:52,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys for listening, our local friends.

894
01:15:52,784 --> 01:15:55,006
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to hear from people outside of Sacramento.

895
01:15:55,026 --> 01:16:01,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear the strangest place you've ever seen a Bomani machine, whether it be DDR or something like that.

896
01:16:02,156 --> 01:16:05,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear the strangest place you've ever seen a DDR or some kind of a Monty machine.

897
01:16:06,679 --> 01:16:11,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what we found out this week, let's rewind to Monday.

898
01:16:11,863 --> 01:16:12,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Monday, Vanilla Sky.

899
01:16:13,344 --> 01:16:18,688
[SPEAKER_03]: After Vanilla Sky was over, LankyStyle, RicePrincess, and I, we all went to Walmart to do some shopping, or at least I was shopping.

900
01:16:19,068 --> 01:16:20,689
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to go buy Cheesy Poofs, basically.

901
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:26,493
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was going to Walmart to buy some Cheesy Poofs, and hold on.

902
01:16:28,274 --> 01:16:30,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki says National Blowjob Day is October 3rd.

903
01:16:32,862 --> 01:16:34,984
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also National Go Commando Day.

904
01:16:35,064 --> 01:16:37,746
[SPEAKER_03]: So National Blowjob Day is October 3rd.

905
01:16:37,806 --> 01:16:41,829
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you missed National Blowjob Day, I want you to celebrate tonight.

906
01:16:42,269 --> 01:16:42,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

907
01:16:43,891 --> 01:16:45,472
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's your chance to make up for it.

908
01:16:45,492 --> 01:16:46,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy belated blowjob day.

909
01:16:46,653 --> 01:16:50,176
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't have anyone to participate with you, then get some flexibility.

910
01:16:50,636 --> 01:16:50,916
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

911
01:16:51,597 --> 01:16:51,977
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

912
01:16:52,037 --> 01:16:53,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Now can I get back on the topic of strange blowing machines?

913
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:55,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so send me a private message.

914
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:57,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Strangest place you've ever seen a Bomani machine.

915
01:16:57,281 --> 01:17:00,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Sky in the chat room over at www.callybomani.com.

916
01:17:00,644 --> 01:17:01,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on orange lines and click on chat.

917
01:17:03,112 --> 01:17:11,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Vanilla Sky, went to get Cheesy Poofs, and usually, whenever I go to Walmart, I can't help but go into the electronics department, because they have cheap electronics.

918
01:17:11,957 --> 01:17:18,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheap mouses, cheap CDs, cheap games, cheap everything, because Walmart is the land of everything cheap.

919
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:18,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Mouses.

920
01:17:18,861 --> 01:17:26,945
[SPEAKER_03]: But for whatever reason, on this Monday, we went to toys and games, we went to stuffed animals and things like that, we did not go into the electronics department.

921
01:17:27,545 --> 01:17:31,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Come to find out Tuesday morning, this comes up on the boards at sacromoney.com.

922
01:17:31,187 --> 01:17:32,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, did you hear...

923
01:17:33,647 --> 01:17:35,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Walmart got a DDR machine.

924
01:17:35,888 --> 01:17:37,349
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm thinking to myself, no they didn't.

925
01:17:37,429 --> 01:17:41,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just there at the Walmart in Folsom on Monday and there was no DDR machine to be found.

926
01:17:42,911 --> 01:17:48,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, turns out, this DDR machine is smack in the middle of the electronics department at Walmart.

927
01:17:49,834 --> 01:17:53,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, most Walmarts I think are all laid out the same.

928
01:17:53,716 --> 01:17:58,278
[SPEAKER_03]: For those listening internationally, Walmart is this huge chain of stores in the U.S.

929
01:17:58,538 --> 01:18:00,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Big, big, big store that sells everything.

930
01:18:01,949 --> 01:18:04,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Most Walmarts, I think, are laid out the same.

931
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:12,791
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like, when you walk in the electronics department, you have your CDs off to one side, and then off to the other side, in this Walmart, giant DDR solo machine.

932
01:18:13,171 --> 01:18:14,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Just standing right there.

933
01:18:15,132 --> 01:18:19,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Fully operational, takes 50 cents to play three songs, or get three coins, or whatever it is.

934
01:18:20,233 --> 01:18:30,355
[SPEAKER_03]: So, now, I've heard of a Walmart having a DDR machine out in the front arcade, or an arcade on the side, but I have never heard of a machine anywhere in the middle of a fucking store.

935
01:18:32,142 --> 01:18:34,784
[SPEAKER_03]: So, of course, couldn't resist, had to go play it today.

936
01:18:35,525 --> 01:18:40,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Had to go rent some errands anyway at Walmart, so I went to go play the Solo 2000 machine.

937
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:47,536
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I want to state, this isn't like the Walmart in Lodi or other places that had it in the front or in a separate arcade.

938
01:18:47,576 --> 01:18:54,342
[SPEAKER_03]: This Solo 2000 machine is right smack in the middle of the electronics department, so as everybody's walking by, people can look at it.

939
01:18:55,157 --> 01:18:56,358
[SPEAKER_03]: The machine is not for sale.

940
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:57,279
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not trying to sell it.

941
01:18:57,759 --> 01:19:03,483
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, they even have a sign on the Solo 2000 machine that says, hey, the Xbox music game.

942
01:19:04,524 --> 01:19:05,144
[SPEAKER_03]: They changed it.

943
01:19:05,184 --> 01:19:06,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they updated it.

944
01:19:06,245 --> 01:19:11,349
[SPEAKER_03]: But last week it said, hey, the Xbox music generator is coming out on such and such day.

945
01:19:11,409 --> 01:19:12,329
[SPEAKER_03]: It had nothing to do with DDR.

946
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:13,610
[SPEAKER_03]: They changed it today.

947
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:16,432
[SPEAKER_03]: It says Xbox DDR coming out November 18th, right?

948
01:19:18,052 --> 01:19:24,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, says nothing about the PlayStation Max 2, says nothing about the already available DDRs out there on PlayStation.

949
01:19:24,502 --> 01:19:26,205
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about promoting the Xbox.

950
01:19:26,485 --> 01:19:29,530
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like Microsoft bought them that machine and put it in the store.

951
01:19:30,551 --> 01:19:30,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

952
01:19:31,539 --> 01:19:34,422
[SPEAKER_03]: But now we have this DDR solo machine in the middle of Walmart.

953
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:38,908
[SPEAKER_06]: It won't be there for long because the parents will see the needles and the barely dressed nurse.

954
01:19:39,088 --> 01:19:40,249
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I was thinking.

955
01:19:40,349 --> 01:19:42,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Walmart, king of censors.

956
01:19:43,192 --> 01:19:46,656
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the one reason I won't really buy CDs at Walmart.

957
01:19:46,757 --> 01:19:52,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll look and see what's new, but I won't buy because I fucking hate that Walmart censors the albums.

958
01:19:53,050 --> 01:19:56,532
[SPEAKER_03]: You go to buy an album at Walmart and you will buy the desensitized version.

959
01:19:56,592 --> 01:20:01,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the fine print, look at the label, and you will see that the CD you're buying at Walmart is the edited version.

960
01:20:02,114 --> 01:20:07,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Meaning they've taken out all the fucks and shits and cop killer statements, right?

961
01:20:08,237 --> 01:20:11,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Even a CD like Madonna's American Life that just came out.

962
01:20:11,059 --> 01:20:15,061
[SPEAKER_03]: The Walmart version in track one, the first song, they took fuck it out.

963
01:20:15,661 --> 01:20:18,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, oh heaven forbid, we're going to hurt our children.

964
01:20:18,502 --> 01:20:18,862
[SPEAKER_03]: That is so...

965
01:20:21,109 --> 01:20:23,792
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another case of companies taking responsibility for other people's children

966
01:20:38,326 --> 01:20:39,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Why should Walmart do that?

967
01:20:39,927 --> 01:20:40,468
[SPEAKER_06]: They shouldn't.

968
01:20:40,588 --> 01:20:43,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't they just not sell the CD that says caution?

969
01:20:43,209 --> 01:20:44,971
[SPEAKER_03]: The CD has the word fuck in it.

970
01:20:45,051 --> 01:20:53,516
[SPEAKER_06]: If the parents don't want the children to listen to something with, you know, bad language in it, they need to freaking police what their children are doing themselves.

971
01:20:53,737 --> 01:20:59,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Walmart should not have to institute these kind of policies, but they do because they're run by the religious right.

972
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:00,441
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a whole other story.

973
01:21:01,862 --> 01:21:02,543
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a whole other story.

974
01:21:02,703 --> 01:21:04,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I prefer calling them the religious wrong.

975
01:21:05,245 --> 01:21:09,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, that's a discussion for a whole other show.

976
01:21:09,528 --> 01:21:10,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you.

977
01:21:10,508 --> 01:21:12,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent point by Leadfoot in the chat room.

978
01:21:12,650 --> 01:21:15,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet they sell rated M games in the gaming section.

979
01:21:16,632 --> 01:21:21,215
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll sell rated M games, but heaven forbid they sell a CD with the word fuck on it.

980
01:21:21,235 --> 01:21:24,217
[SPEAKER_06]: If the video came wrong, how bad could it be?

981
01:21:25,476 --> 01:21:25,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

982
01:21:26,277 --> 01:21:31,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear about these parents that are suing the makers of Grand Theft Auto because some people got shot or something?

983
01:21:31,302 --> 01:21:31,943
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not the parents.

984
01:21:31,983 --> 01:21:37,248
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the relatives of the victims who got shot because some kids went out and imitated Grand Theft Auto.

985
01:21:37,569 --> 01:21:39,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Sue the kids' parents for being idiots.

986
01:21:40,431 --> 01:21:41,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, seriously.

987
01:21:41,733 --> 01:21:42,854
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the game's fault.

988
01:21:42,894 --> 01:21:44,696
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the damned impressionable people.

989
01:21:45,316 --> 01:21:48,600
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they're the social sheep of the world.

990
01:21:52,514 --> 01:21:55,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, back to DDR before we got off on a little bit of a tangent.

991
01:21:56,395 --> 01:21:57,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to DDR in the middle of Walmart.

992
01:21:58,075 --> 01:21:58,675
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quiet.

993
01:21:58,715 --> 01:22:00,275
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't really hear it unless you're on it.

994
01:22:00,636 --> 01:22:03,916
[SPEAKER_03]: The pad is so close to the machine that literally I'm six foot two.

995
01:22:04,477 --> 01:22:07,917
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first time I've ever played DDR where I have to look down to see the machine.

996
01:22:08,177 --> 01:22:09,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to look down to see the screen.

997
01:22:09,638 --> 01:22:10,338
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really weird.

998
01:22:11,676 --> 01:22:14,619
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

999
01:22:29,358 --> 01:22:32,160
[SPEAKER_03]: I played it like three times this week, all on different occasions.

1000
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:42,168
[SPEAKER_03]: One was getting a pro-action replay so I could cheat in F-Zero GX, and the one that was getting Castlevania, then today was just going there for the hell of it.

1001
01:22:43,449 --> 01:22:47,352
[SPEAKER_03]: And all times I played on there, and they'll actually pay me to play because I'm good.

1002
01:22:49,074 --> 01:22:53,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm like, you know, whatever that guy's name... Yoshi.

1003
01:22:54,138 --> 01:22:54,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Yoshi.

1004
01:22:54,638 --> 01:22:56,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I am like Yoshi.

1005
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:58,961
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that work where they were paying you to play?

1006
01:22:59,001 --> 01:22:59,502
[SPEAKER_03]: What did they do?

1007
01:23:00,322 --> 01:23:00,942
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all here.

1008
01:23:00,962 --> 01:23:01,923
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll give you 50 cents.

1009
01:23:01,943 --> 01:23:03,944
[SPEAKER_03]: We're supposed to give you 50 cents so you can play this.

1010
01:23:05,545 --> 01:23:07,686
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just because of people that aren't paying attention.

1011
01:23:07,946 --> 01:23:10,128
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one nice guy that's been there the last few times.

1012
01:23:10,148 --> 01:23:12,929
[SPEAKER_03]: He offered to pay for my games and he did for like one of them.

1013
01:23:12,989 --> 01:23:13,730
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, no, that's cool.

1014
01:23:13,770 --> 01:23:14,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the other ones, you know.

1015
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,592
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, I don't want them to just...

1016
01:23:18,092 --> 01:23:19,113
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1017
01:23:35,473 --> 01:23:36,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's kind of cool what they're doing.

1018
01:23:36,874 --> 01:23:41,538
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, for some reason, Ultramix is getting a lot of press, it seems like, for me.

1019
01:23:41,899 --> 01:23:46,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, I mean, look, you have the news story, you've got, like, machines in stores.

1020
01:23:46,242 --> 01:23:49,866
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, that's all you're hearing around this goddamn Ultramix.

1021
01:23:51,167 --> 01:23:53,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's like they're really pushing this one.

1022
01:23:56,441 --> 01:24:02,204
[SPEAKER_03]: The Walmartrion is located in Folsom, California on Riley Street, I think it is.

1023
01:24:02,485 --> 01:24:06,367
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where you will find a DDR solid machine in the electronics department.

1024
01:24:06,487 --> 01:24:07,668
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, way out in the middle of nowhere.

1025
01:24:07,848 --> 01:24:09,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear if any other Walmarts are doing this.

1026
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:13,292
[SPEAKER_03]: So check your local Walmart and let us know if your Walmart's done this.

1027
01:24:14,012 --> 01:24:14,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1028
01:24:14,453 --> 01:24:15,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they moved that one on Lodi.

1029
01:24:15,814 --> 01:24:16,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

1030
01:24:16,434 --> 01:24:20,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I want to get back to the question I posed earlier to the chat room and read their responses here.

1031
01:24:20,718 --> 01:24:21,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a whole bunch.

1032
01:24:22,219 --> 01:24:24,421
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's hear about some strange places.

1033
01:24:25,522 --> 01:24:25,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

1034
01:24:27,704 --> 01:24:28,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1035
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:40,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Zodiac Knight says the strangest place he ever saw a DDR machine was at a Tri-County flea market.

1036
01:24:42,977 --> 01:24:44,778
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR Machine and the Flea Market.

1037
01:24:45,459 --> 01:24:46,580
[SPEAKER_03]: The Tri-County Flea Market.

1038
01:24:49,321 --> 01:24:52,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Baka says, strangest place you ever saw a DDR machine was in a pizza parlor.

1039
01:24:53,024 --> 01:24:55,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's kind of a weird site at first.

1040
01:24:55,545 --> 01:24:57,767
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's kind of common where we are.

1041
01:24:57,787 --> 01:24:58,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1042
01:25:05,262 --> 01:25:08,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Bumlover says, I saw a DDR machine in my butt.

1043
01:25:08,164 --> 01:25:09,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that's so mature.

1044
01:25:09,345 --> 01:25:10,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for sharing.

1045
01:25:12,267 --> 01:25:17,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Nostylan says, Walmart once had a Beatmania 5 key before DDR became popular.

1046
01:25:17,811 --> 01:25:18,572
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of strange.

1047
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:25,256
[SPEAKER_03]: SnubDisfinoid says, pump it up in the middle of an airport in Brazil.

1048
01:25:25,296 --> 01:25:27,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, like right in the middle of the fucking terminal.

1049
01:25:27,938 --> 01:25:28,539
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool.

1050
01:25:28,579 --> 01:25:30,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Pump it up machine right in the middle of the Brazil airport.

1051
01:25:34,721 --> 01:25:38,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Jazz kind of cites a pizza parlor as well and the Beatmania and Walmart.

1052
01:25:41,908 --> 01:25:43,870
[SPEAKER_03]: John Fields says, a pizza hut.

1053
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:46,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like cheese on your pads, he says.

1054
01:25:47,573 --> 01:25:49,815
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of pizza parlors kind of being a strange place for DJ Ranma.

1055
01:25:50,055 --> 01:25:52,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the reason why the pizza parlor thinks... I know one, a McDonald's.

1056
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:54,039
I've heard of one being in a McDonald's.

1057
01:25:54,439 --> 01:25:54,859
[SPEAKER_03]: What, Loki?

1058
01:25:54,879 --> 01:25:55,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Say that in a...

1059
01:25:58,775 --> 01:26:13,677
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also, I was told this, there was a Beatmania 6 mix, I think, in the middle of the mall outside the arcade in Mobile, which I'm going to actually go see if that machine is there or not when I'm there.

1060
01:26:14,293 --> 01:26:18,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, okay, I'm not even going to read that one because that doesn't make sense.

1061
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:21,360
[SPEAKER_03]: I said strange place to see a DDR machine.

1062
01:26:22,422 --> 01:26:29,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, seeing a DDR extreme machine in the Metreon, says StaplerX.

1063
01:26:30,191 --> 01:26:31,132
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a strange sign.

1064
01:26:31,332 --> 01:26:34,094
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a strange sign because they held out for the longest time.

1065
01:26:35,275 --> 01:26:40,159
[SPEAKER_03]: And then says a DDR machine in a bowling alley by my college.

1066
01:26:40,479 --> 01:26:44,162
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in great shape because no one ever plays it except the occasional drunken bowler.

1067
01:26:44,842 --> 01:26:49,006
[SPEAKER_03]: There's colleges.

1068
01:26:50,807 --> 01:26:54,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I'm seeing a DDR machine outside of the CBS studios in New York.

1069
01:26:55,638 --> 01:27:01,760
[SPEAKER_03]: John Fields wants to remind us of that when the CBS Today show or whatever the hell it's called did their little thing on location.

1070
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:02,980
[SPEAKER_06]: And that thing was really stupid.

1071
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:04,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was really stupid.

1072
01:27:06,901 --> 01:27:09,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Tapioca Express having a DDR machine, that was always kind of funny.

1073
01:27:09,981 --> 01:27:11,402
[SPEAKER_06]: The one that's nearly dead now.

1074
01:27:14,263 --> 01:27:15,143
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it?

1075
01:27:15,223 --> 01:27:15,383
[SPEAKER_03]: The...

1076
01:27:16,852 --> 01:27:19,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Dance Fever Dance Fever

1077
01:27:33,732 --> 01:27:35,072
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to bring back StarCraft.

1078
01:27:35,153 --> 01:27:38,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait, I remember one that they had that was kind of interesting.

1079
01:27:38,494 --> 01:27:46,396
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a machine at the arcade in the Winchester Mystery House.

1080
01:27:47,417 --> 01:27:47,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1081
01:27:48,557 --> 01:27:48,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1082
01:27:50,318 --> 01:27:51,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was short-lived, though.

1083
01:27:53,539 --> 01:27:54,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it scaring off all the ghosts?

1084
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:55,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1085
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:59,061
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that they have an arcade at the Winchester Mystery House is strange enough.

1086
01:28:03,015 --> 01:28:03,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to go there.

1087
01:28:32,046 --> 01:28:46,082
[SPEAKER_03]: and then, oh, a DDR Solo machine in the middle of the baseball field, Raley's Field here in Sacramento, has a Solo 2000 machine just right there out on the, what do they call that, the course, the, what the hell do they call that, where the, concourse, thank you.

1088
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:47,940
[SPEAKER_03]: The Conquers

1089
01:29:17,091 --> 01:29:21,075
[SPEAKER_03]: The way the cage match works, just a reminder, we're going to play three songs for you guys.

1090
01:29:21,415 --> 01:29:22,376
[SPEAKER_03]: You vote for your favorite.

1091
01:29:22,396 --> 01:29:26,780
[SPEAKER_03]: The winning song goes into rotation on Orange Lounge Radio all week long.

[SPEAKER_03]: So the only way you can participate is to be in our chat room.

1094
01:29:35,668 --> 01:29:38,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here's the first song you can vote for tonight.

1095
01:29:38,391 --> 01:29:40,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And you only hear a clip of it because it won last week.

1096
01:29:41,233 --> 01:29:49,076
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's a long clip of Above and Beyond with the song Far From In Love, tonight's first pick for the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match.

1097
01:29:50,236 --> 01:30:04,942
[SPEAKER_11]: I can see behind your eyes that you're afraid of who you are Only silence now between us, I'm amazed we've come this far Far from in love

1098
01:30:17,673 --> 01:30:18,714
Thank you for watching!

1099
01:31:42,885 --> 01:31:44,906
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, that was song number one.

1100
01:31:44,926 --> 01:31:49,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Last week's winner, Above and Beyond with Far From In Love.

1101
01:32:12,372 --> 01:32:14,233
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, second song in tonight's cage match.

1102
01:32:14,253 --> 01:32:27,237
[SPEAKER_03]: You get to hear the whole thing, and it's kind of a long one, but it's Loki's pick, and he has picked for you... It's a remix, it's a white label remix of Broken Wings by Mr. Mister, and I guess this one's also by Emotion.

1103
01:32:27,677 --> 01:32:44,552
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a group, and it's remixed by a group on the internet, well, it's a group of DJs, all women, called the Diva DJs, and it's pretty sweet, so I just found this today because I was looking for white label remixes, because I've got some really cool ones, and I don't know, just listen to it, it's good.

1104
01:32:45,934 --> 01:32:48,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Explain real fast what a white label mix is, for those who may not know.

1105
01:32:49,133 --> 01:32:52,694
[SPEAKER_03]: A white label mix is a non-official remix of a song.

1106
01:32:52,774 --> 01:32:57,355
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not authorized by the actual artist.

1107
01:32:57,395 --> 01:32:59,795
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more of kind of a thing that you'd find in a club.

1108
01:32:59,835 --> 01:33:07,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone adds a little spice to their set by actually doing a live remix of something or making their own remix and then playing it on their set.

1109
01:33:07,277 --> 01:33:08,117
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where it is.

1110
01:33:09,717 --> 01:33:11,918
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here's song number two in tonight's cage match.

1111
01:33:12,078 --> 01:33:16,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Emotion featuring Mr. Mister with a song called Broken Wings.

1112
01:33:16,479 --> 01:33:16,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

1113
01:36:03,932 --> 01:36:04,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1114
01:40:45,815 --> 01:40:47,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that was song number two tonight.

1115
01:40:47,516 --> 01:40:50,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Emotion featuring Mr. Mister with Broken Wings.

1116
01:40:50,096 --> 01:40:51,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around and see what everybody thought of that.

1117
01:40:51,877 --> 01:40:53,717
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start off with our guest, Bradley, tonight.

1118
01:40:54,918 --> 01:40:55,638
[SPEAKER_22]: That was okay.

1119
01:40:55,698 --> 01:40:57,358
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't really get into it very much.

1120
01:40:57,378 --> 01:40:59,159
[SPEAKER_22]: I give it a seven.

1121
01:40:59,179 --> 01:41:06,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the 80s, so it gets a ten.

1122
01:41:08,142 --> 01:41:09,422
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of my favorite 80s songs.

1123
01:41:10,717 --> 01:41:12,518
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I love the 80s, too.

1124
01:41:13,279 --> 01:41:16,321
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, the original put me to sleep instead of that one.

1125
01:41:17,001 --> 01:41:18,723
[SPEAKER_06]: So it gets a seven.

1126
01:41:20,144 --> 01:41:22,285
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't a bad mix, but it was pretty damn repetitive.

1127
01:41:22,965 --> 01:41:24,186
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't find my inhaler!

1128
01:41:24,707 --> 01:41:29,430
[SPEAKER_03]: At three minutes in length, that song would have gotten a ten, but at seven minutes in length, it gets a seven.

1129
01:41:29,770 --> 01:41:31,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't find my inhaler.

1130
01:41:31,932 --> 01:41:32,272
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1131
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:39,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's move on to the last song in tonight's cage match, which would be Jamie's pick.

1132
01:41:39,223 --> 01:41:42,644
[SPEAKER_03]: And I noticed that Jamie is trying this artist again.

1133
01:41:43,325 --> 01:41:46,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie's picking an artist she picked last week, but that's okay.

1134
01:41:46,686 --> 01:41:48,787
[SPEAKER_06]: CyberX is cool, and this one's better.

1135
01:41:49,008 --> 01:41:51,929
[SPEAKER_03]: It features somebody else this time anyway, so it would be a different vocalist.

1136
01:41:51,949 --> 01:41:53,350
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know which one I picked, but I like it.

1137
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:54,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, I'll tell you.

1138
01:41:54,830 --> 01:41:57,312
[SPEAKER_03]: It's CyberX featuring Rupina this time.

1139
01:41:57,352 --> 01:41:58,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Where the hell is my inhaler?

1140
01:41:59,273 --> 01:41:59,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, Jamie.

1141
01:42:00,842 --> 01:42:02,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you want to say about CyberX featuring Rupina?

1142
01:42:03,364 --> 01:42:06,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, this song is cool and I had it on repeat ten times today.

1143
01:42:06,727 --> 01:42:08,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here's song number three tonight you can vote for.

1144
01:42:08,668 --> 01:42:10,990
[SPEAKER_03]: CyberX featuring Rupina with Like a Flower.

1145
01:42:11,190 --> 01:42:11,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy!

1146
01:42:11,451 --> 01:42:18,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a Flower

1147
01:42:31,407 --> 01:42:32,408
Thank you for watching!

1148
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:01,648
Thanks for watching!

1149
01:44:53,075 --> 01:44:54,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

1150
01:46:16,972 --> 01:46:23,135
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to make my dream come true, it's right here.

1151
01:46:23,676 --> 01:46:28,618
[SPEAKER_11]: No matter what the future holds, I will never give up.

1152
01:46:28,858 --> 01:46:32,460
[SPEAKER_11]: I will live in the present.

1153
01:47:41,076 --> 01:47:43,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that was song number three for tonight.

1154
01:47:43,178 --> 01:47:46,680
[SPEAKER_03]: That was CyberX featuring Rapina with Little Flower.

1155
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:48,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around and see what folks thought of that.

1156
01:47:48,501 --> 01:47:52,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley, you're going to need to grab this mic unless you get up and grab Jamie's.

1157
01:47:52,104 --> 01:47:53,205
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think, Bradley?

1158
01:47:55,767 --> 01:47:56,547
[SPEAKER_22]: It was okay.

1159
01:47:57,008 --> 01:47:58,649
[SPEAKER_22]: Her voice sort of got it to me a little bit.

1160
01:47:58,849 --> 01:48:00,410
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't really like her voice all that much.

1161
01:48:00,430 --> 01:48:02,752
[SPEAKER_22]: I give it a six.

1162
01:48:02,772 --> 01:48:04,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Loki.

1163
01:48:06,334 --> 01:48:06,835
[SPEAKER_03]: It was okay.

1164
01:48:06,855 --> 01:48:07,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I give it a six.

1165
01:48:10,401 --> 01:48:13,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that way better than the song you picked last week, actually.

1166
01:48:14,042 --> 01:48:15,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds very IU Trance to me, actually.

1167
01:48:16,383 --> 01:48:18,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I seriously thought I was listening to IU Trance for a minute there.

1168
01:48:19,744 --> 01:48:23,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I seriously would give that a 10, except I think it needs to be a little tighter.

1169
01:48:23,405 --> 01:48:24,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Same problem I had with the last song.

1170
01:48:26,326 --> 01:48:28,886
[SPEAKER_03]: So I give it a 9.

1171
01:48:29,526 --> 01:48:30,087
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not bad.

1172
01:48:30,447 --> 01:48:31,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I could stand listening to that.

1173
01:48:31,846 --> 01:48:36,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I like best that it kept changing throughout the whole song, all the background did.

1174
01:48:37,468 --> 01:48:39,950
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I give it a nine and a half.

1175
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:42,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been listening to it all day, so.

1176
01:48:44,472 --> 01:48:46,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a trance version of the chicken dance.

1177
01:48:47,973 --> 01:48:49,094
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I have one.

1178
01:48:50,234 --> 01:48:52,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, yeah, haven't you been threatening to put that in for a while now?

1179
01:48:53,996 --> 01:48:54,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps.

1180
01:48:54,956 --> 01:48:55,316
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1181
01:48:55,696 --> 01:48:57,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so let's review the three songs.

1182
01:48:58,658 --> 01:48:58,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob...

1183
01:49:00,209 --> 01:49:01,330
[SPEAKER_06]: You have it, don't you?

1184
01:49:01,610 --> 01:49:02,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave it to you.

1185
01:49:02,631 --> 01:49:02,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhere.

1186
01:49:03,131 --> 01:49:04,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do it for the afterbirth.

1187
01:49:04,493 --> 01:49:06,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we'll play it in the afterbirth.

1188
01:49:07,516 --> 01:49:10,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's review the three songs you can vote for tonight, shall we?

1189
01:49:10,779 --> 01:49:12,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start off with song number one.

1190
01:49:12,340 --> 01:49:18,106
[SPEAKER_03]: It's last week's winner and the song is called, it's Above and Beyond with a song called Far From In Love.

1191
01:49:20,788 --> 01:49:21,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like that clip.

1192
01:49:28,749 --> 01:49:35,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Song number two you can vote for tonight is Emotion featuring Mr. Mister with Broken Wings.

1193
01:49:35,511 --> 01:49:36,331
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's a clip of that.

1194
01:49:47,233 --> 01:49:53,975
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's song number three you can vote for tonight which is Cyber X featuring Rapina with a song called Little Flower.

1195
01:49:58,525 --> 01:50:01,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoops, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1196
01:50:01,807 --> 01:50:03,348
[SPEAKER_03]: My mouse is being over-sensitive today.

1197
01:50:03,368 --> 01:50:04,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's try that again.

1198
01:50:12,995 --> 01:50:14,015
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, there you go.

1199
01:50:14,536 --> 01:50:16,317
[SPEAKER_21]: There's your three songs you can vote for tonight.

1200
01:50:16,997 --> 01:50:18,679
[SPEAKER_21]: Place vote now.

1201
01:50:19,179 --> 01:50:23,162
[SPEAKER_21]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1202
01:50:23,342 --> 01:50:28,085
[SPEAKER_21]: And we'll tally up those votes and let you know in a little while who won tonight's cage match.

1203
01:50:28,888 --> 01:50:29,768
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't that sound exciting?

1204
01:50:31,189 --> 01:50:33,390
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to do something else soon, too.

1205
01:50:33,850 --> 01:50:34,191
[SPEAKER_21]: What's that?

1206
01:50:35,511 --> 01:50:37,172
[SPEAKER_06]: What are we best known for, Rob?

1207
01:50:38,533 --> 01:50:38,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranting?

1208
01:50:39,093 --> 01:50:39,873
[SPEAKER_03]: The FUs of the week?

1209
01:50:40,894 --> 01:50:41,554
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah!

1210
01:50:41,734 --> 01:50:42,895
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll do those in a little bit.

1211
01:50:42,915 --> 01:50:44,236
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll do those next break or something.

1212
01:50:44,636 --> 01:50:45,976
[SPEAKER_21]: What is Loki whispering to me here?

1213
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:46,897
[SPEAKER_03]: He's whispering something to me.

1214
01:50:46,917 --> 01:50:48,138
[SPEAKER_21]: The FUs of the week.

1215
01:50:48,338 --> 01:50:49,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, FUs of the week.

1216
01:50:50,599 --> 01:50:51,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on top of it.

1217
01:50:51,419 --> 01:50:52,500
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to be prompted.

1218
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:54,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not need to be prompted.

1219
01:50:55,501 --> 01:50:55,621
Okay.

1220
01:50:59,252 --> 01:51:00,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Loki ran off to the bathroom.

1221
01:51:00,752 --> 01:51:03,394
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to have him do a sim update, but I guess that's not going to work.

1222
01:51:03,994 --> 01:51:09,017
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Jamie, what's going to happen when you... You're going to be gone next week, right?

1223
01:51:09,237 --> 01:51:11,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not next week, but you're going to be here for next week's show.

1224
01:51:11,358 --> 01:51:13,039
[SPEAKER_03]: And after that, you're gone for a couple weeks.

1225
01:51:13,059 --> 01:51:14,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're not going to be back until episode number 70.

1226
01:51:15,504 --> 01:51:23,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I may, I don't know that I'll be able to play the show, but I may have some degree of internet access.

1227
01:51:23,568 --> 01:51:23,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1228
01:51:23,768 --> 01:51:24,869
[SPEAKER_06]: So at least be in the chat room.

1229
01:51:25,249 --> 01:51:25,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1230
01:51:25,509 --> 01:51:26,610
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have pre-shows done.

1231
01:51:26,730 --> 01:51:29,952
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have my cage match picks in case, you know, the winner don't.

1232
01:51:30,352 --> 01:51:30,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-huh.

1233
01:51:30,792 --> 01:51:33,053
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll be there in spirit.

1234
01:51:33,553 --> 01:51:34,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1235
01:51:35,034 --> 01:51:38,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll eat some beef and pee so you can smell my beefy pee.

1236
01:51:39,016 --> 01:51:39,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray.

1237
01:51:40,397 --> 01:51:41,998
[SPEAKER_03]: For those that were listening in the first hour of the show.

1238
01:51:42,758 --> 01:51:43,999
[SPEAKER_06]: I said I don't eat beef.

1239
01:51:44,079 --> 01:51:44,999
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll eat some asparagus.

1240
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:45,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1241
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:47,021
[SPEAKER_06]: It has really stinky peas.

1242
01:51:47,041 --> 01:51:47,521
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll work.

1243
01:51:49,222 --> 01:51:55,065
[SPEAKER_03]: So, going off, let's plug the spin-off shows, what's going on on the spin-off shows, because I want to know what's going to happen to Pump Up the Volume.

1244
01:51:55,945 --> 01:51:58,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Monday night's on the station, Vanilla Sky.

1245
01:51:58,527 --> 01:52:02,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow night we're going to be talking about some big news in the Final Fantasy world that came up this week.

1246
01:52:03,169 --> 01:52:08,312
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about that and Castlevania, full review and breakdown on our thoughts on the new Castlevania.

1247
01:52:08,992 --> 01:52:13,037
[SPEAKER_03]: and other stuff that we usually talk about on Vanilla Sky, just randomness.

1248
01:52:14,358 --> 01:52:20,825
[SPEAKER_03]: As I kind of compare it, it's sort of the Oprah show on Oxygen, the one that's like after the real Oprah show.

1249
01:52:21,326 --> 01:52:23,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not watch Oxygen, I've just heard about it.

1250
01:52:24,830 --> 01:52:25,811
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never heard of it.

1251
01:52:27,833 --> 01:52:28,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, forget it.

1252
01:52:29,054 --> 01:52:30,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us what's on Tuesday nights, Jamie.

1253
01:52:31,175 --> 01:52:36,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Pump up the volume, starting at 7 o'clock with the pre-show.

1254
01:52:37,881 --> 01:52:39,162
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what time my show starts.

1255
01:52:39,182 --> 01:52:39,962
[SPEAKER_06]: 7 o'clock with the pre-show.

1256
01:52:40,983 --> 01:52:41,804
[SPEAKER_06]: 7.30 starts the show show.

1257
01:52:42,444 --> 01:52:44,706
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are in the chat room, you can request shit.

1258
01:52:45,607 --> 01:52:47,729
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll play it, because I'm nice like that.

1259
01:52:48,589 --> 01:52:58,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I may be doing requests, I may have to be a little bit more judicious, because I'm going to be recording this one, because it's going to repeat while I'm in Alabama.

1260
01:53:03,291 --> 01:53:03,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me.

1261
01:53:05,633 --> 01:53:07,976
[SPEAKER_06]: The week after, though, I'm doing the show on Monday.

1262
01:53:09,597 --> 01:53:11,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I will be on an airplane on Tuesday.

1263
01:53:11,419 --> 01:53:11,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1264
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:14,142
[SPEAKER_03]: So, our show is Swip Swap next week.

1265
01:53:14,162 --> 01:53:15,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're going to swap next week.

1266
01:53:17,525 --> 01:53:17,746
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

1267
01:53:20,098 --> 01:53:23,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I've pre-recorded last week's show, and I'm going to record this week's show again.

1268
01:53:24,461 --> 01:53:28,224
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll get to hear them if you miss them, which you have no excuse to have missed them.

1269
01:53:29,405 --> 01:53:29,985
[SPEAKER_06]: I kick you.

1270
01:53:30,906 --> 01:53:34,529
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's over at 10.30, and you have to be in the chat room, or else you miss the full experience.

1271
01:53:34,889 --> 01:53:36,110
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, just like with this show.

1272
01:53:38,312 --> 01:53:39,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else to plug with Hub of the Volume?

1273
01:53:41,658 --> 01:53:42,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me drugs.

1274
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:43,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1275
01:53:44,020 --> 01:53:48,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Wednesday nights coming back the week after next, if I'm not mistaken.

1276
01:53:48,783 --> 01:53:49,964
[SPEAKER_03]: You going to be ready for it, Loki?

1277
01:53:50,664 --> 01:53:51,545
[SPEAKER_03]: The week after next?

1278
01:53:53,246 --> 01:53:53,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1279
01:53:54,186 --> 01:53:55,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Week after next comes what?

1280
01:53:55,367 --> 01:53:57,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be as ready as I normally am.

1281
01:53:57,649 --> 01:54:03,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving to Wednesdays is... I'm just kidding.

1282
01:54:03,353 --> 01:54:03,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Live wire.

1283
01:54:04,233 --> 01:54:07,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Lesbian hookers in outer space, Loki presents.

1284
01:54:09,096 --> 01:54:09,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

1285
01:54:10,464 --> 01:54:13,427
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll change it to bondage lesbian hookers from outer space.

1286
01:54:15,569 --> 01:54:18,291
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happens on bondage lesbian hookers from outer space?

1287
01:54:18,832 --> 01:54:23,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I play music while bondage lesbian hookers from outer space entertain me.

1288
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:27,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

1289
01:54:28,481 --> 01:54:30,343
[SPEAKER_03]: November is going to be a big month for the station.

1290
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:33,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God we will have a new website done.

1291
01:54:34,062 --> 01:54:35,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I have so many ideas for the website.

1292
01:54:35,883 --> 01:54:37,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it to be so comprehensive.

1293
01:54:37,564 --> 01:54:39,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I just fucking suck at designing websites.

1294
01:54:39,926 --> 01:54:41,207
[SPEAKER_03]: We need pictures first.

1295
01:54:41,707 --> 01:54:42,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the pictures.

1296
01:54:42,368 --> 01:54:43,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Bust the pictures.

1297
01:54:43,329 --> 01:54:44,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a website.

1298
01:54:44,509 --> 01:54:45,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I want pictures.

1299
01:54:45,310 --> 01:54:45,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a website.

1300
01:54:45,990 --> 01:54:46,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Website.

1301
01:54:47,251 --> 01:54:47,832
[SPEAKER_03]: No, pictures.

1302
01:54:48,272 --> 01:54:49,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take pictures right now.

1303
01:54:50,310 --> 01:54:51,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want pictures.

1304
01:54:52,111 --> 01:54:52,611
[SPEAKER_06]: None of me.

1305
01:54:52,732 --> 01:54:54,353
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to make some for you on Patreon.

1306
01:54:54,373 --> 01:55:00,076
[SPEAKER_03]: We can just, like, do a picture of, like, some character from, you know, 2DX or something.

1307
01:55:00,116 --> 01:55:01,177
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Celica, there you go.

1308
01:55:01,197 --> 01:55:04,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't I just give you all the pictures I made of DarkSakura?

1309
01:55:05,179 --> 01:55:05,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow!

1310
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:08,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, I like my idea better.

1311
01:55:08,201 --> 01:55:09,282
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not letting me off that easy.

1312
01:55:11,113 --> 01:55:13,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, you're going to be the Junior Senior Robot now.

1313
01:55:14,256 --> 01:55:18,319
[SPEAKER_03]: So I swear to God we'll have a new website this month at some point because I'm sick of the old ones.

1314
01:55:18,419 --> 01:55:19,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be the Junior Senior Robot.

1315
01:55:19,901 --> 01:55:22,783
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a new location for the site that we're going to unveil too and everything.

1316
01:55:22,843 --> 01:55:23,484
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be coming up.

1317
01:55:23,944 --> 01:55:24,544
[SPEAKER_03]: We have all that.

1318
01:55:24,945 --> 01:55:29,389
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have some new specials we're planning for November.

1319
01:55:29,409 --> 01:55:30,750
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be doing some new specials.

1320
01:55:31,530 --> 01:55:36,615
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got an idea for one today that's going to take a lot of work, but it's going to be really fucking cool if I can pull it off.

1321
01:55:37,075 --> 01:55:37,756
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to do that.

1322
01:55:38,716 --> 01:55:38,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1323
01:55:39,756 --> 01:55:42,099
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to work on that for November.

1324
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:47,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Also in November, the whole way you hear Orange Lounge Radio will probably be changing.

1325
01:55:47,666 --> 01:55:48,988
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to sound even better.

1326
01:55:49,408 --> 01:55:53,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though you're still on a modem line, if you have an MP3 codec, we're going to sound even better.

1327
01:55:53,734 --> 01:55:54,695
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming in November.

1328
01:55:55,740 --> 01:56:25,235
[SPEAKER_03]: and of course you can't forget episode 69 episode 69 and unfortunately Jamie won't be here for episode 69 but she will be here for episode 70 which I think is what I said would be the season 4 premiere but I'm not sure I'm not sure yet so lots of stuff coming to Orange Lounge Radio in November which makes sense because it's November sweeps alright we're going to take a break and I'm going to tally up the votes to the cage match last call for votes on the Orange Lounge cage match by the way while we take this break

1329
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:35,867
[SPEAKER_03]: The chat room is asking, since we're kind of doing these themed breaks tonight of a certain Bomani game, the chat room is begging, please can we do an Oha break?

1330
01:56:38,489 --> 01:56:40,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm saying sure, let's do an Oha break tonight.

1331
01:56:41,011 --> 01:56:46,716
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to hear the Oha Ska, and we'll hear Why, the Zona song, and we'll hear Candy.

1332
01:56:49,018 --> 01:56:49,738
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back.

1333
01:56:50,419 --> 01:56:51,640
[SPEAKER_03]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1334
01:57:07,586 --> 01:57:08,829

[SPEAKER_10]: Music, Music, Music

1340
02:02:02,672 --> 02:02:07,635
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1341
02:02:35,908 --> 02:02:37,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we care what people think of us?

1342
02:02:37,870 --> 02:02:39,732
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

1343
02:02:39,752 --> 02:02:41,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1344
02:02:41,653 --> 02:02:44,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah!

1345
02:02:45,737 --> 02:02:50,762
[SPEAKER_18]: Extreme Bomani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

1346
02:02:51,823 --> 02:02:55,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, also coming in November, new promos!

1347
02:02:55,996 --> 02:02:56,837
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1348
02:03:26,448 --> 02:03:26,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Good God.

1349
02:03:27,529 --> 02:03:31,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Tourney Mix 4th Plus has gone on DDREI.com.

1350
02:03:31,931 --> 02:03:34,392
[SPEAKER_03]: So go there if you really give a shit.

1351
02:03:35,472 --> 02:03:38,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I've lost all hope in Tourney Mixes anymore.

1352
02:03:38,974 --> 02:03:40,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I really just don't care anymore.

1353
02:03:41,015 --> 02:03:42,296
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't plan on entering them.

1354
02:03:42,456 --> 02:03:43,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really care.

1355
02:03:43,596 --> 02:03:46,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I just... I haven't played Set Mania in months.

1356
02:03:46,578 --> 02:03:48,899
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm waiting until my cabinet's done, then I'll play on that.

1357
02:03:50,273 --> 02:03:56,660
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be honest, the Japanese people make better sim files than you fucking Americans and Europeans will ever make So shut up

1358
02:04:09,733 --> 02:04:11,474
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only a few of you that are any good.

1359
02:04:11,934 --> 02:04:12,535
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

1360
02:04:12,635 --> 02:04:13,836
[SPEAKER_03]: And you people know who you are.

1361
02:04:14,316 --> 02:04:16,777
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the hell with all of you.

1362
02:04:17,158 --> 02:04:17,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone else.

1363
02:04:17,798 --> 02:04:19,459
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only like, what?

1364
02:04:19,599 --> 02:04:21,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Three people I... Okay, let's see.

1365
02:04:21,720 --> 02:04:22,721
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got that Matt guy.

1366
02:04:23,399 --> 02:04:25,100
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got, um, Utterdude.

1367
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:26,100
[SPEAKER_03]: They're awesome.

1368
02:04:26,521 --> 02:04:29,982
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got, um, the people at DWI Insanity.

1369
02:04:30,022 --> 02:04:31,723
[SPEAKER_03]: They make really awesome sim files.

1370
02:04:32,243 --> 02:04:33,924
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, Healing Vision is part of them.

1371
02:04:34,384 --> 02:04:36,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the only people that make any good sim files!

1372
02:04:36,866 --> 02:04:37,526
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what it is?

1373
02:04:37,626 --> 02:04:38,126
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what it is?

1374
02:04:38,346 --> 02:04:40,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Tourney Mix has turned into the new Parapara.

1375
02:04:41,268 --> 02:04:44,750
[SPEAKER_03]: When it was first out, everybody thought it was cool, and now it's cool to make fun of it.

1376
02:04:45,510 --> 02:04:49,072
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because they keep adding more and more rules to it, and it's just retarded.

1377
02:04:49,632 --> 02:04:51,313
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is, also, um...

1378
02:04:52,734 --> 02:04:53,134
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it?

1379
02:04:54,575 --> 02:04:58,456
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another group that was pretty good, too, in making sim files.

1380
02:04:58,616 --> 02:04:59,477
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember who they are.

1381
02:04:59,497 --> 02:05:05,219
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like the DWI New World Order or some crap like that.

1382
02:05:05,539 --> 02:05:06,039
[SPEAKER_03]: That was all right.

1383
02:05:06,279 --> 02:05:12,202
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Japanese people make awesome sim files, better than you'll ever make, and they've been doing it for years.

1384
02:05:12,582 --> 02:05:14,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So just give up.

1385
02:05:14,663 --> 02:05:16,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stop, and that's it.

1386
02:05:17,244 --> 02:05:21,826
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know... Do people still make stuff for BM98?

1387
02:05:22,990 --> 02:05:26,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, oh man, the stuff for BM98 is awesome.

1388
02:05:26,853 --> 02:05:27,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I love BM98.

1389
02:05:27,654 --> 02:05:37,981
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I'm sorry, but it takes a lot more talent to create something, a BMS file, for, you know, BM98 than it will for Step Mania or DWI.

1390
02:05:38,021 --> 02:05:42,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're talking like key sounds, they arrange it, they make their own, you know, song.

1391
02:05:42,084 --> 02:05:45,387
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember playing BM98 before I'd even seen DDR.

1392
02:05:45,667 --> 02:05:46,808
[SPEAKER_03]: It is just so much fun.

1393
02:05:48,698 --> 02:05:49,319
[SPEAKER_03]: So awesome.

1394
02:05:49,839 --> 02:05:57,842
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I am so sick of hearing about Bomani Ruler because the guy supposedly quit making DWIs many years ago.

1395
02:05:58,122 --> 02:06:03,164
[SPEAKER_03]: How many years ago did he say, I'm tired of people bitching about myself being too hard, so I stopped.

1396
02:06:03,505 --> 02:06:04,945
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet he keeps making them.

1397
02:06:05,625 --> 02:06:07,546
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to quit, you quit.

1398
02:06:07,766 --> 02:06:10,167
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't keep coming back and then quitting again.

1399
02:06:10,447 --> 02:06:11,088
[SPEAKER_03]: No one cares.

1400
02:06:11,168 --> 02:06:13,969
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like fucking Michael Jordan, and he sucks now.

1401
02:06:15,084 --> 02:06:17,805
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the Hulk Hogan of the Bimani world.

1402
02:06:18,205 --> 02:06:19,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stop.

1403
02:06:19,305 --> 02:06:21,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stop making sim files.

1404
02:06:21,806 --> 02:06:31,388
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, the few people out there that make actual good sim files, you know, I'm willing to try a few new people out, but a lot of times they just suck.

1405
02:06:31,728 --> 02:06:35,849
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you get one sim file that's a 12-foot rating and it's just shit.

1406
02:06:36,389 --> 02:06:38,209
[SPEAKER_03]: So, whatever.

1407
02:06:38,369 --> 02:06:40,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I just delete the rest and, you know,

1408
02:06:41,590 --> 02:06:42,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Play the few that are good.

1409
02:06:42,691 --> 02:06:48,258
[SPEAKER_03]: You are no longer after creating the largest step file collection on the internet, correct?

1410
02:06:49,059 --> 02:06:49,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

1411
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:51,241
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just I don't really care anymore.

1412
02:06:52,543 --> 02:06:59,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I download one of everything I don't have, but I'm not actively pursuing to have a huge collection.

1413
02:06:59,090 --> 02:07:02,474
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not trying to have the largest step file penis on the internet, basically.

1414
02:07:03,348 --> 02:07:04,949
[SPEAKER_03]: You just want to have the best looking.

1415
02:07:05,289 --> 02:07:06,590
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't really care anymore.

1416
02:07:06,670 --> 02:07:07,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine just looks nice.

1417
02:07:10,831 --> 02:07:12,872
[SPEAKER_03]: My penis is quite nice.

1418
02:07:14,633 --> 02:07:17,595
[SPEAKER_03]: But my Simfon collection, I don't really care because I don't play it anymore.

1419
02:07:18,715 --> 02:07:20,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not until my cabinet is done.

1420
02:07:20,556 --> 02:07:22,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Once that's done, I'll play it again.

1421
02:07:23,277 --> 02:07:27,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need to sort through like 6,000 songs to find something I want to play because that just takes too long.

1422
02:07:27,939 --> 02:07:29,380
[SPEAKER_03]: So, to hell with it.

1423
02:07:32,046 --> 02:07:39,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and there's some pretty cool skins out there you might want to check out for Stepmania Trans Machina, which is a good one I mentioned back a while ago.

1424
02:07:39,755 --> 02:07:41,256
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want to go check that out.

1425
02:07:41,877 --> 02:07:44,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's in the Stepmania thread or skinning.

1426
02:07:44,059 --> 02:07:44,620
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find it.

1427
02:07:45,080 --> 02:07:49,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm sure there's been some Stepmania updates because DWI Denver updates, so screw that.

1428
02:07:50,446 --> 02:07:51,327
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you go to...

1429
02:07:52,808 --> 02:07:55,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's DDRAmerica.com or something like that.

1430
02:07:55,110 --> 02:07:57,971
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that BitTorrent site I mentioned a few weeks back.

1431
02:07:58,352 --> 02:08:06,957
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the full set of, what was it, the full set of the Max 2 USA stuff already done, which I already downloaded.

1432
02:08:08,598 --> 02:08:10,780
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I could have done it a long time ago, but I just don't care.

1433
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:11,260
[SPEAKER_03]: So there.

1434
02:08:13,361 --> 02:08:13,662
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1435
02:08:14,422 --> 02:08:14,782
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1436
02:08:15,703 --> 02:08:16,644
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all that I care about.

1437
02:08:16,724 --> 02:08:17,124
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1438
02:08:17,978 --> 02:08:25,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about, since it kind of relates to Step Files, let's talk about this whole Into the Groove thing that's coming out here.

1439
02:08:26,582 --> 02:08:27,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you bring that up for us?

1440
02:08:33,565 --> 02:08:34,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's right.

1441
02:08:34,085 --> 02:08:35,666
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about Into the Groove tonight.

1442
02:08:37,167 --> 02:08:39,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the Madonna song, but, you know.

1443
02:08:39,848 --> 02:08:43,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll take an excuse to play Madonna.

1444
02:08:43,590 --> 02:08:43,870
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1445
02:08:44,858 --> 02:08:46,359
[SPEAKER_03]: A few things that are good about this.

1446
02:08:46,839 --> 02:08:48,981
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, you've got Kiel making some of the music.

1447
02:08:49,001 --> 02:08:50,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, what the hell is Into the Groove?

1448
02:08:50,622 --> 02:08:51,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Into the Groove... Don't tell me what's in it.

1449
02:08:52,003 --> 02:08:52,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me what the hell is it.

1450
02:08:53,303 --> 02:08:59,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Into the Groove is gonna be a new arcade software very similar to the DDR that's supposed to be hitting arcades.

1451
02:09:00,668 --> 02:09:03,610
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's Linux-based, which... Whoop-a-dee-doo.

1452
02:09:03,910 --> 02:09:06,472
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, it's Linux-based, which means geeks made it.

1453
02:09:06,972 --> 02:09:08,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Big fucking geeks made it.

1454
02:09:08,913 --> 02:09:09,774
[SPEAKER_03]: But, here's the thing.

1455
02:09:10,314 --> 02:09:11,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it's, um...

1456
02:09:12,135 --> 02:09:20,540
[SPEAKER_03]: is created by the same, it's created by Christian Ferd, he's working on it, and he's the guy behind Stepmania, so there's a lot of similarities to Stepmania on there.

1457
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:34,828
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty much a lawsuit waiting to happen, but they quote that it's, you know, it's very different from DDR, but looking at the screen, I have to differ, it doesn't look like it's very different at all.

1458
02:09:36,048 --> 02:09:52,286
[SPEAKER_03]: and it looks kind of craptastic but anyways they've got some nifty stuff on there like they've got a mode where you can play where there's four arrows just like DDR but they're on the four sides of the screen and so the arrows are coming out of the center towards the outside which is kind of cool now it's a little different

1459
02:09:53,411 --> 02:09:54,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Dizzy, Sudden, Expand, Stetmania

1460
02:10:12,056 --> 02:10:13,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's going to happen, but whatever.

1461
02:10:14,258 --> 02:10:24,988
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting, because I see on this sample screenshot they've got Atom Bomb by Fluke, which is like that generic trance song that's on every compilation CD ever, but it's a cool song, so whatever.

1462
02:10:26,129 --> 02:10:28,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe got Atom Bomb.

1463
02:10:28,991 --> 02:10:30,813
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what, Romeo and Juliet?

1464
02:10:30,833 --> 02:10:32,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never heard of a lot of these other songs, actually.

1465
02:10:33,375 --> 02:10:34,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you know these?

1466
02:10:34,356 --> 02:10:34,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't.

1467
02:10:35,036 --> 02:10:38,958
[SPEAKER_03]: But you said now, this is what's interesting, is that people in the DDR world are getting into this.

1468
02:10:38,998 --> 02:10:41,199
[SPEAKER_03]: You said that Kiel is possibly having licensed songs on this?

1469
02:10:41,219 --> 02:10:41,559
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he does.

1470
02:10:41,899 --> 02:10:43,300
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, um, where'd he go?

1471
02:10:44,540 --> 02:10:46,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember where I read this.

1472
02:10:47,582 --> 02:10:48,742
[SPEAKER_03]: It says about Rockstar.

1473
02:10:48,782 --> 02:10:49,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where to go.

1474
02:10:50,443 --> 02:10:51,663
[SPEAKER_03]: He's on the staff, basically.

1475
02:10:51,844 --> 02:10:52,984
[SPEAKER_03]: He's on the staff, yeah.

1476
02:10:53,024 --> 02:10:54,825
[SPEAKER_03]: He's doing music on it, and Chris Danford...

1477
02:10:55,565 --> 02:10:57,066
[SPEAKER_03]: is doing some other stuff on it.

1478
02:10:57,806 --> 02:10:59,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we play a Kiel original song on his tape.

1479
02:10:59,767 --> 02:11:01,187
[SPEAKER_03]: We've actually been playing it for the past two years.

1480
02:11:01,227 --> 02:11:02,268
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's time for us to change it.

1481
02:11:02,608 --> 02:11:11,591
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm just saying, he's kind of been known in the Bomani scene a little while for making some good originals that would be good for DDR.

1482
02:11:11,611 --> 02:11:14,532
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just kind of ironic that this is now going to end up in a DDR-style game.

1483
02:11:14,672 --> 02:11:20,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not too surprising because he has some of the songs, I believe, that are on...

1484
02:11:22,495 --> 02:11:27,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say they're on that Flash game, that Flash DDR.

1485
02:11:28,058 --> 02:11:31,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gods, maybe they're licensed Neo Max.

1486
02:11:32,681 --> 02:11:34,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh god, I don't give a shit.

1487
02:11:34,862 --> 02:11:39,604
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you that keep telling me that Neo Max is going to be in a DDR mix, shut up.

1488
02:11:40,105 --> 02:11:40,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Just shut up.

1489
02:11:41,205 --> 02:11:41,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody cares.

1490
02:11:41,986 --> 02:11:44,667
[SPEAKER_03]: That is like the most overrated thing ever, ever.

1491
02:11:44,827 --> 02:11:49,169
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more overrated than... I don't know, but just shut up.

1492
02:11:50,090 --> 02:11:50,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I...

1493
02:11:51,823 --> 02:11:52,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1494
02:11:53,845 --> 02:11:54,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.

1495
02:11:54,425 --> 02:11:57,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually think I may prefer Neomax to Max, period.

1496
02:11:57,047 --> 02:11:58,649
[SPEAKER_03]: But fucking, who cares?

1497
02:11:59,490 --> 02:12:06,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Neomax will never be on a DDR-type machine because they only put good files in DDR.

1498
02:12:07,566 --> 02:12:11,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, once again, this goes back to what I was saying before.

1499
02:12:11,707 --> 02:12:18,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the fuck won't people let me put in a StepMania-based PC in a DDR machine and we'll just do it that way?

1500
02:12:18,369 --> 02:12:31,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Since most of the DDR machines are violating copyright laws anyways because they have licensed music that's out of this country that don't share the licensing in the U.S., basically, you know, it's like an import CD or whatever.

1501
02:12:32,768 --> 02:12:33,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1502
02:12:49,893 --> 02:12:57,597
[SPEAKER_03]: The only people that would bitch about it, ironically, are the people that love DDR, which they're shooting themselves in the foot, so to speak.

1503
02:12:58,258 --> 02:13:02,280
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't understand why they just don't do that.

1504
02:13:02,580 --> 02:13:07,883
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I'm trying to push that on our local arcade here, but no one seems to be biting.

1505
02:13:11,039 --> 02:13:15,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think Konami is going to sue the pants off these people if this game ends up in an arcade?

1506
02:13:15,530 --> 02:13:18,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think Konami is going to sue the pants off them?

1507
02:13:18,578 --> 02:13:18,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1508
02:13:19,701 --> 02:13:19,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1509
02:13:20,814 --> 02:13:21,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you think that's a little odd?

1510
02:13:22,475 --> 02:13:22,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1511
02:13:22,995 --> 02:13:23,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Will they?

1512
02:13:23,496 --> 02:13:24,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the rumor is.

1513
02:13:24,736 --> 02:13:25,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, rumor was a while back.

1514
02:13:25,997 --> 02:13:27,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if this was true or not.

1515
02:13:27,178 --> 02:13:27,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying it's a rumor.

1516
02:13:28,218 --> 02:13:35,102
[SPEAKER_03]: But rumor was one of the reasons that Konami Arcade Mixes, you stopped seeing them, is because they ran into trouble with the folks that made Pump It Up.

1517
02:13:35,602 --> 02:13:41,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Some kind of like thing where Pump It Up got the copyright to make dancing machines in the U.S.

1518
02:13:43,006 --> 02:13:46,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and Amiro, the folks that made Pump It Up, had the copyrights on U.S.

1519
02:13:46,028 --> 02:13:46,228
[SPEAKER_03]: machines.

1520
02:13:46,248 --> 02:13:48,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though they haven't done shit with it either.

1521
02:13:48,509 --> 02:13:48,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, God.

1522
02:13:50,615 --> 02:13:54,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but Pump It Up, it's just not as exciting.

1523
02:13:54,138 --> 02:13:55,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what Pump It Up is doing wrong.

1524
02:13:55,739 --> 02:13:57,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't put my finger on it.

1525
02:13:57,380 --> 02:13:59,402
[SPEAKER_03]: It just isn't as good.

1526
02:13:59,442 --> 02:14:04,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sorry if you're a fan of Pump It Up, but there's just something about it.

1527
02:14:04,926 --> 02:14:07,068
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not the same as DDR.

1528
02:14:07,368 --> 02:14:07,808
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.

1529
02:14:07,968 --> 02:14:08,889
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not the fact that it's 5.

1530
02:14:09,710 --> 02:14:13,593
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the interface, the giant screen, the songs are subpar.

1531
02:14:14,974 --> 02:14:17,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it is, but Pump It Up is not the same as DDR.

1532
02:14:19,346 --> 02:14:27,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so I think it was something like DDR sued Pump It Up overseas, and so Pump It Up got the rights in America and then sued DDR here or something like that.

1533
02:14:28,008 --> 02:14:29,049
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way the rumor went.

1534
02:14:29,869 --> 02:14:32,570
[SPEAKER_03]: So would Konami really have a right to step in and sue?

1535
02:14:33,210 --> 02:14:36,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether you did the Step Mania machine in some arcade or... Look at it.

1536
02:14:36,811 --> 02:14:38,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami hasn't sued Step Mania.

1537
02:14:38,531 --> 02:14:44,333
[SPEAKER_03]: If I were Konami, if I had written DDR, I would have sued the pants off of Step Mania years ago.

1538
02:14:46,511 --> 02:14:52,155
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to say, as far as that lawsuit was concerned, it was basically, I think it was overruled.

1539
02:14:52,995 --> 02:15:00,240
[SPEAKER_06]: That they were considered different, therefore, I'll find the stuff on it, but I believe that nothing came of it.

1540
02:15:02,742 --> 02:15:05,984
[SPEAKER_03]: So, basically another frivolous lawsuit that resulted in nothing.

1541
02:15:06,064 --> 02:15:06,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray.

1542
02:15:06,744 --> 02:15:08,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray for the judicial system.

1543
02:15:13,829 --> 02:15:21,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is just people responding to Konami's, um, of America's unwillingness to make a new arcade DDR release.

1544
02:15:21,855 --> 02:15:29,420
[SPEAKER_03]: People want fucking a new DDR mix, and I'm just so pissed off with the fact it would be so easy to do.

1545
02:15:29,700 --> 02:15:38,406
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so fucking easy to do, and we can actually license the music because there's a loophole because it sort of would fall under the category of a, um...

1546
02:15:40,063 --> 02:15:45,865
[SPEAKER_03]: AVM, what was it, sort of fall under the jukebox licensing rights.

1547
02:15:46,245 --> 02:15:48,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's kind of classified as a jukebox.

1548
02:15:48,246 --> 02:15:55,709
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very gray area, but you could license it for a flat fee of like $364 a month, or not a month, a year.

1549
02:15:56,389 --> 02:15:58,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's change.

1550
02:15:58,870 --> 02:16:00,031
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like a buck a day.

1551
02:16:00,631 --> 02:16:01,091
[SPEAKER_03]: A buck a day.

1552
02:16:01,111 --> 02:16:03,532
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't tell me that no one plays that machine not once a day.

1553
02:16:04,281 --> 02:16:07,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Hardware would be only a one-time buy of like a PC.

1554
02:16:07,582 --> 02:16:09,883
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we wouldn't even really need to do shit to it.

1555
02:16:10,144 --> 02:16:11,204
[SPEAKER_03]: And upgrades would be free.

1556
02:16:13,045 --> 02:16:15,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's money in the bank right there.

1557
02:16:15,666 --> 02:16:18,107
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not jumping on it.

1558
02:16:18,167 --> 02:16:24,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead, they're buying $1,500 bootlegs of really shitty, like, hacked DDR shit.

1559
02:16:24,930 --> 02:16:26,551
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even that good.

1560
02:16:26,871 --> 02:16:28,271
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just all flawed like hell.

1561
02:16:29,712 --> 02:16:31,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand why people aren't jumping on this.

1562
02:16:31,373 --> 02:16:31,993
[SPEAKER_03]: It can work...

1563
02:16:32,808 --> 02:17:00,049
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna, like I said, I'm gonna, my proposal, I'm gonna do the Golf Land, I'm gonna try, like, show the Keith and stuff, I'm gonna, like, redesign, you know, Step Mania's thing to be just like DDR, have, like, skins and everything to make it the most convincing, um, arcade port, cause it's not like some sort of hacked shit where it's gonna look like crap, all of, you know, really nice steps for songs, full sets of steps, not this, like, one difficulty shit, you know, full sets of steps,

1564
02:17:00,929 --> 02:17:18,142
[SPEAKER_03]: and all that stuff with no full unlocks and it's got you know you can hook it up so it runs off of credits like from coin slot it's it could work but you know people will be just like no because it's not official Konami but people are going to sadly buy this piece of shit machine and

1565
02:17:19,042 --> 02:17:20,463
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to see these in arcades now.

1566
02:17:20,884 --> 02:17:23,605
[SPEAKER_03]: But to be honest, I don't understand why... Well, now give it a chance.

1567
02:17:23,645 --> 02:17:24,746
[SPEAKER_03]: You haven't seen this machine yet.

1568
02:17:24,786 --> 02:17:25,547
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be pretty cool.

1569
02:17:25,627 --> 02:17:25,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

1570
02:17:26,127 --> 02:17:29,949
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, I don't understand why people aren't jumping the chance to do something like this.

1571
02:17:30,129 --> 02:17:33,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know Keith, if he was still at Scandia, would have jumped on this a long time.

1572
02:17:34,152 --> 02:17:37,714
[SPEAKER_03]: He would have totally gone with the step mania idea for the PC.

1573
02:17:37,774 --> 02:17:38,255
[SPEAKER_03]: He would have done it.

1574
02:17:38,275 --> 02:17:43,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he wanted to do... If I could find a way to hack the actual disk, he wanted me to go ahead and do that and...

1575
02:17:43,812 --> 02:17:45,313
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, make a mix that way.

1576
02:17:46,133 --> 02:17:46,693
[SPEAKER_03]: So why not?

1577
02:17:46,934 --> 02:17:56,358
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if people can get away with making these shitty bootlegs that really look like bootlegs, why not try to make a convincing hacked version of DDR?

1578
02:17:58,319 --> 02:17:58,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1579
02:17:58,639 --> 02:18:03,922
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, what do you think, Jamie?

1580
02:18:03,942 --> 02:18:05,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you play this new mix?

1581
02:18:05,122 --> 02:18:09,124
[SPEAKER_03]: This into the groove thing that's kind of like DDR but not really?

1582
02:18:10,445 --> 02:18:13,026
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought from the first moment I saw it that it looked really stupid.

1583
02:18:13,906 --> 02:18:14,486
[SPEAKER_06]: So, no.

1584
02:18:16,187 --> 02:18:19,688
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if it's actually released, yeah, and it's there, yeah, I might give it a try.

1585
02:18:20,328 --> 02:18:23,870
[SPEAKER_06]: But it just looked really, really uninteresting.

1586
02:18:23,990 --> 02:18:27,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it didn't even look visually appealing.

1587
02:18:29,582 --> 02:18:30,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my advice.

1588
02:18:31,143 --> 02:18:39,548
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to do this and you're going to put your balls on the line or whatever and you're going to maybe get threatened by Konami, here is what I've been saying.

1589
02:18:39,848 --> 02:18:42,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami should be doing for the longest time.

1590
02:18:42,289 --> 02:18:45,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I bring this up every episode for like the past year.

1591
02:18:45,091 --> 02:18:45,932
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I've said.

1592
02:18:46,312 --> 02:18:48,213
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how you can avoid the lawsuit and everything.

1593
02:18:48,895 --> 02:18:50,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Make DDR competitive.

1594
02:18:51,397 --> 02:18:55,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Make DDR a competitive game, and now it's a completely different kind of game.

1595
02:18:55,440 --> 02:18:58,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Steal the dance magic mode idea, but make it your own.

1596
02:18:58,443 --> 02:19:01,465
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're doing dance magic without necessarily doing dance magic.

1597
02:19:01,765 --> 02:19:04,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't fuck it up like that one Dreamcast game.

1598
02:19:04,527 --> 02:19:05,468
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell was that game?

1599
02:19:05,508 --> 02:19:11,313
[SPEAKER_03]: The one, the, uh, the shareware Dreamcast game that we reviewed on the show.

1600
02:19:11,353 --> 02:19:12,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Dita Fury!

1601
02:19:12,373 --> 02:19:13,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Dita Fury!

1602
02:19:13,434 --> 02:19:13,714
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1603
02:19:14,155 --> 02:19:14,415
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1604
02:19:14,675 --> 02:19:15,616
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't fucking count.

1605
02:19:16,337 --> 02:19:20,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Take Dance Magic, make it cool, there you go.

1606
02:19:20,438 --> 02:19:28,999
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what Konami of America should have done, or Konami of Japan, anybody should have done six months ago after Extreme was done and they were done with DDR.

1607
02:19:30,759 --> 02:19:38,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami of America should have put out, I don't know what the hell is stopping them, they should have put out a new American release by now and this is what's going to happen now.

1608
02:19:38,201 --> 02:19:42,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're going to go to court and sue these other people and if these other people play their cards right, it's done.

1609
02:19:42,741 --> 02:19:45,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami of America is done in the arcades with DDR.

1610
02:19:49,439 --> 02:19:49,859
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

1611
02:19:49,879 --> 02:19:54,961
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, into the groove, it's probably going to suffer from the same thing that Pump It Up does.

1612
02:19:55,321 --> 02:20:00,584
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be the same, but there's going to be something about it that you're just going to go, it's not DDR.

1613
02:20:01,184 --> 02:20:02,644
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't try to be DDR.

1614
02:20:02,804 --> 02:20:03,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Be something different.

1615
02:20:04,591 --> 02:20:10,518
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm saying go and be more like a competitive game or come up with something.

1616
02:20:10,919 --> 02:20:12,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Think of something we haven't thought of.

1617
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:18,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if you put me in charge, if it was legit, if I could get the go-ahead to do something like this, I could make it...

1618
02:20:19,680 --> 02:20:20,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Mix of DDR, that would be perfect.

1619
02:20:21,322 --> 02:20:25,007
[SPEAKER_03]: It would just, the machine would just keep going.

1620
02:20:25,087 --> 02:20:26,669
[SPEAKER_03]: People would keep playing this damn thing.

1621
02:20:27,410 --> 02:20:30,394
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just because people get bored with the same songs and stuff in there.

1622
02:20:30,695 --> 02:20:32,597
[SPEAKER_03]: They're bored with like, I mean, look at DDR Extreme.

1623
02:20:32,617 --> 02:20:34,460
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been out for like, boy, like a year.

1624
02:20:34,480 --> 02:20:35,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost a year.

1625
02:20:35,681 --> 02:20:37,262
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and people are bored with it.

1626
02:20:37,382 --> 02:20:39,884
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just like... Because DDR Extreme was nothing exciting to begin with.

1627
02:20:39,944 --> 02:20:43,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Half of it, half of the excitement factor was old songs coming back.

1628
02:20:44,106 --> 02:20:50,010
[SPEAKER_03]: The other half of it was a bunch of Konami songs that have been beaten to death in the ground already through other games.

1629
02:20:50,430 --> 02:20:54,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Only a couple of the Transplant songs, I can think of maybe a couple off the top of my head...

1630
02:20:54,793 --> 02:21:01,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Gummel and a couple and just these things that were like, you know, kind of they were lost in other Bomani games that became more popular again with DDR.

1631
02:21:01,299 --> 02:21:07,264
[SPEAKER_03]: But shit like V and A, they were cool like at first, but now those songs are done because we wore them out with 2DX.

1632
02:21:07,685 --> 02:21:09,867
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dance Mania licenses were weak.

1633
02:21:10,167 --> 02:21:12,389
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the weakest they've ever been in a DDR game, ever.

1634
02:21:12,629 --> 02:21:15,932
[SPEAKER_03]: The US licenses in DDR were better than anything they licensed in Xtreme.

1635
02:21:17,972 --> 02:21:31,446
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying right now that pretty much the last thing I heard about DDR was an interview with Naoki that they did for this last DDR Extreme live party thing that they're reporting on.

1636
02:21:31,466 --> 02:21:37,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my, I saw they had a little thing there on there showing the song list where they're talking about it.

1637
02:21:37,292 --> 02:21:41,316
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds like that Naoki is going to be working now on Beatmania stuff.

1638
02:21:42,353 --> 02:21:54,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Strictly, because DDR is either done completely as far as arcade and maybe possibly home versions in the Japanese home versions.

1639
02:21:54,703 --> 02:21:58,025
[SPEAKER_03]: It's either done completely or they're putting it on hiatus for a few years.

1640
02:21:59,246 --> 02:22:01,308
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to come out with something new.

1641
02:22:04,870 --> 02:22:07,152
[SPEAKER_03]: People want more of this stuff.

1642
02:22:07,192 --> 02:22:10,735
[SPEAKER_03]: You're getting new fans to it and they're going to the arcade and playing it and they're like, okay, I'm bored now.

1643
02:22:11,540 --> 02:22:13,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's just different to us here.

1644
02:22:13,662 --> 02:22:16,144
[SPEAKER_03]: But don't tell me DDR is dying in Japan.

1645
02:22:16,204 --> 02:22:18,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we read it here on Monday on Vanilla Sky.

1646
02:22:18,446 --> 02:22:18,826
[SPEAKER_03]: We read it.

1647
02:22:19,067 --> 02:22:22,289
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR Extreme, one of the top ten selling games in Japan this week.

1648
02:22:22,570 --> 02:22:24,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Japan, a highly competitive market for video games.

1649
02:22:24,811 --> 02:22:26,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Extreme still lands in the top ten.

1650
02:22:26,493 --> 02:22:28,595
[SPEAKER_03]: The home version, where DDR fucking sucks the place.

1651
02:22:28,615 --> 02:22:30,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't tell me DDR is dying.

1652
02:22:30,036 --> 02:22:30,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at 2DX.

1653
02:22:30,716 --> 02:22:33,579
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, oh, well, we need a petition before we release another home game.

1654
02:22:34,540 --> 02:22:34,740
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1655
02:22:36,174 --> 02:22:37,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Unheard of here.

1656
02:22:37,836 --> 02:22:40,699
[SPEAKER_03]: If they tried something like that here, I mean, granted, the U.S.

1657
02:22:40,739 --> 02:22:44,584
[SPEAKER_03]: isn't Japan, but if they tried something like that here, they'd get laughed out of the country.

1658
02:22:48,489 --> 02:22:49,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, you know...

1659
02:22:51,178 --> 02:22:58,542
[SPEAKER_03]: The only trouble you're going to run into if you run a machine like this is you're going to get the RAA, you know, well these songs aren't licensed or whatever.

1660
02:22:58,822 --> 02:23:00,423
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only trouble you're going to run into.

1661
02:23:00,443 --> 02:23:07,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami's not going to even give a shit about the fact that your machine is a bootleg or something like that because your machine isn't supposed to be over here in the first place.

1662
02:23:07,406 --> 02:23:12,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're promoting awareness for the DDR home versions, which is the only thing Konami of America gives a shit about right now.

1663
02:23:13,669 --> 02:23:14,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I mean...

1664
02:23:15,726 --> 02:23:18,369
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR Extreme or whatever, those aren't supposed to be over here.

1665
02:23:18,389 --> 02:23:19,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Those aren't licensed for U.S.

1666
02:23:20,110 --> 02:23:21,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the hilarious thing.

1667
02:23:22,092 --> 02:23:27,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody made a damn good point, and of all places, DDR Freak this week.

1668
02:23:28,378 --> 02:23:28,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I was reading it.

1669
02:23:30,039 --> 02:23:37,646
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody said, in the instruction manual to Max 2 USA, it says, go play DDR in the arcades.

1670
02:23:37,987 --> 02:23:41,410
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, for the full experience of DDR, go play it in the arcades.

1671
02:23:43,556 --> 02:23:45,357
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck are you going to find in the arcades?

1672
02:23:45,737 --> 02:23:48,518
[SPEAKER_03]: You are not going to find DDR USA anywhere in the arcades anymore.

1673
02:23:48,898 --> 02:23:53,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me, somebody tell me in Nortel, where there is more Bomani machines than anywhere else in the nation.

1674
02:23:54,821 --> 02:23:56,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it California, period.

1675
02:23:56,762 --> 02:24:00,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Can anybody name me three places that have a DDR USA machine?

1676
02:24:00,684 --> 02:24:02,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Can anybody name me three places with a DDR USA machine?

1677
02:24:02,625 --> 02:24:03,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even think of one.

1678
02:24:03,945 --> 02:24:04,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the Metreon.

1679
02:24:04,586 --> 02:24:05,406
[SPEAKER_03]: The Metreon, one.

1680
02:24:08,078 --> 02:24:15,477
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're telling people to go out and play DDR in the arcades, you're telling them go and play the machine that says don't play it because it's illegal outside of Japan.

1681
02:24:18,015 --> 02:24:19,256
[SPEAKER_03]: It just, it doesn't make sense.

1682
02:24:19,696 --> 02:24:21,657
[SPEAKER_03]: They're preaching two different things.

1683
02:24:21,837 --> 02:24:26,580
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, yeah, this isn't supposed to be over here, but it's over here, so, you know, whatever, go ahead.

1684
02:24:27,281 --> 02:24:38,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that there's much that they can do as far as, like, complaining that there's licensing or whatever, like, as far as music goes, because the machines aren't supposed to be over here in the first place, music isn't licensed, so you would run into that.

1685
02:24:38,068 --> 02:24:42,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's, this is my whole thing, is why DDR USA, they're turning their back on it.

1686
02:24:42,130 --> 02:24:43,031
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, you know, saying...

1687
02:24:43,431 --> 02:24:49,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying, oh, they're pretending they don't notice that DDR Extreme exists because they're not having to pay for the licensing.

1688
02:24:49,695 --> 02:24:54,838
[SPEAKER_03]: And hey, all these great songs, we're not having to pay for, and they promote our home releases.

1689
02:24:55,178 --> 02:25:01,081
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we try to do this, the RIAA sucks so fucking much that they'd be taking all our money to do these licenses.

1690
02:25:01,161 --> 02:25:02,042
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not worth it.

1691
02:25:02,162 --> 02:25:02,882
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not worth it.

1692
02:25:03,162 --> 02:25:04,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Have Japan license the songs for us.

1693
02:25:05,904 --> 02:25:09,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll bet you anything that is the true reason why Konami of America...

1694
02:25:11,807 --> 02:25:13,727
[SPEAKER_03]: They pretend that the importing doesn't exist.

1695
02:25:14,127 --> 02:25:16,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Because then that way they don't have to worry about licensing.

1696
02:25:16,728 --> 02:25:17,508
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all on Japan.

1697
02:25:18,249 --> 02:25:23,770
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if an artist or a record label comes back and says, I'm seeing these things all over America.

1698
02:25:24,710 --> 02:25:25,611
[SPEAKER_03]: That's out of our control.

1699
02:25:25,831 --> 02:25:27,171
[SPEAKER_03]: The Japanese movement, that's out of our control.

1700
02:25:27,191 --> 02:25:29,292
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't stop them from importing.

1701
02:25:29,352 --> 02:25:33,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be honest, I think you would get in real trouble if you started selling.

1702
02:25:33,453 --> 02:25:34,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Say I made a new mix, okay?

1703
02:25:36,607 --> 02:25:37,228
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a new mix.

1704
02:25:38,008 --> 02:25:39,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I have already a logo done for mine.

1705
02:25:39,870 --> 02:25:42,172
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called DDR EX2, Extreme 2.

1706
02:25:43,073 --> 02:25:46,196
[SPEAKER_03]: So, say I made this and I went and sold it on the internet.

1707
02:25:46,316 --> 02:25:49,940
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where you get into trouble because you're fucking selling a bootleg hacked piece of shit.

1708
02:25:50,500 --> 02:25:58,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you're going to run it in one arcade on one machine and there's only one place in the world that you can play this thing, I don't see what the problem is.

1709
02:25:59,457 --> 02:26:00,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1710
02:26:16,011 --> 02:26:24,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see where they're losing any money, because we know we have the latest version there, and they're buying all the official ones that come out, but they're not releasing it anymore, so it's just useless software.

1711
02:26:25,281 --> 02:26:31,067
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like saying I take an arcade cabinet that has like an old version of Street Fighter in there, and I put another game in there.

1712
02:26:31,468 --> 02:26:32,388
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same damn thing.

1713
02:26:34,070 --> 02:26:34,771
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as I'm concerned.

1714
02:26:35,592 --> 02:26:38,355
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't see what the problem is.

1715
02:26:41,127 --> 02:26:50,733
[SPEAKER_03]: John Fields is giving me a suggestion here about going to DDR Freak and looking at the California page and finding just how many USA machines are in California.

1716
02:26:50,793 --> 02:26:56,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so 437 places to play DDR in California per DDR Freak.

1717
02:26:56,417 --> 02:26:58,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see how many of those have a USA machine.

1718
02:26:59,959 --> 02:27:00,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and I just hit cancel.

1719
02:27:01,420 --> 02:27:02,121
[SPEAKER_03]: So out of 437 places to play DDR...

1720
02:27:04,281 --> 02:27:08,104
[SPEAKER_03]: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

1721
02:27:05,422 --> 02:27:08,104
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of them are boomers.

1722
02:27:08,405 --> 02:27:10,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them are all boomers.

1723
02:27:10,607 --> 02:27:11,948
[SPEAKER_03]: So 20 locations out of 437.

1724
02:27:33,707 --> 02:27:36,748
[SPEAKER_03]: 5%.

1725
02:27:34,528 --> 02:27:36,748
[SPEAKER_03]: 5% of all places that have DDR, it's a USA machine.

1726
02:27:37,528 --> 02:27:46,291
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you tell somebody to go out and play DDR, 95% chance some newbie is not going to be playing a USA machine.

1727
02:27:46,371 --> 02:27:48,692
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to be playing a USA-made machine.

1728
02:27:55,154 --> 02:27:56,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody's arguing how many I counted.

1729
02:27:57,074 --> 02:27:58,955
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the places had two USA machines.

1730
02:27:59,015 --> 02:27:59,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I only counted it once.

1731
02:27:59,875 --> 02:28:01,276
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't count if they have two USA machines.

1732
02:28:02,955 --> 02:28:06,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, really, if you look at it, most places have multiple machines.

1733
02:28:06,176 --> 02:28:08,736
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Extreme and Max 2, and forget it.

1734
02:28:08,856 --> 02:28:09,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget it.

1735
02:28:09,356 --> 02:28:10,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, let's leave it at that.

1736
02:28:14,877 --> 02:28:16,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I don't understand.

1737
02:28:17,278 --> 02:28:20,458
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be really easy just, you know, to do this.

1738
02:28:20,998 --> 02:28:24,359
[SPEAKER_03]: And, as long as people didn't make a big deal about it, I don't see what the problem is.

1739
02:28:24,379 --> 02:28:29,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, no, I don't see anyone at Konami going, oh my god, there's a bootleg DDR Megamix.

1740
02:28:29,873 --> 02:28:31,614
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're selling that shit, okay?

1741
02:28:31,855 --> 02:28:34,376
[SPEAKER_03]: They're selling a bootleg and no one's coming down on it.

1742
02:28:34,657 --> 02:28:38,840
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't think... That Megamix we talked about last week with the solid green boxes.

1743
02:28:38,920 --> 02:28:41,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, DDR Megamix, it looks like a piece of fucking shit.

1744
02:28:41,061 --> 02:28:42,943
[SPEAKER_03]: People are buying it for our $1,500.

1745
02:28:43,503 --> 02:28:49,948
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as I'm aware, it doesn't have any new songs other than Extreme, what Extreme had, even though it said it had all the fourth mix and all that stuff.

1746
02:28:50,448 --> 02:28:57,033
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you're buying a hacked piece of shit and selling on the internet, on eBay where everyone can see it,

1747
02:28:58,042 --> 02:29:14,692
[SPEAKER_03]: and Konami's not coming down on them for this shit because they don't care because it's not a threat so if I make one machine in California one machine in the fucking world I don't think it's going to be a threat so they're not going to come down on me

1748
02:29:16,897 --> 02:29:19,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley, I've been so rude, I haven't let you comment on this yet.

1749
02:29:19,298 --> 02:29:22,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything you want to say about the DDR bootleg machine, all that stuff?

1750
02:29:23,240 --> 02:29:26,381
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can untangle the cord from this fucking chair that likes to eat the cords?

1751
02:29:28,262 --> 02:29:28,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.

1752
02:29:29,503 --> 02:29:30,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, okay.

1753
02:29:30,864 --> 02:29:31,224
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1754
02:29:31,684 --> 02:29:36,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, who's back there folding laundry, anything else you want to say on the bootleg machines?

1755
02:29:39,523 --> 02:29:41,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't have much of a comment on it.

1756
02:29:41,786 --> 02:29:55,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think that, you know, if you look at, and this is honest, this is me, if I see a bootleg version on one side and I see an official DDR on the other, I am probably 90% of the time going to play the original.

1757
02:29:56,361 --> 02:30:04,402
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care if it's, you know, upgraded extreme or an extreme, I'm probably going to go play the extreme machine, and that's me.

1758
02:30:05,023 --> 02:30:13,844
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, I usually prefer to give my support to Konami instead of, even if it's Konami in Japan, instead of somebody's pocket.

1759
02:30:16,184 --> 02:30:18,365
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're not making Apothena, that's still another thing.

1760
02:30:18,505 --> 02:30:22,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I still will play the original over a homemade version.

1761
02:30:25,046 --> 02:30:25,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1762
02:30:26,354 --> 02:30:27,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, break time.

1763
02:30:27,895 --> 02:30:29,936
[SPEAKER_03]: When we come back, we're going to do the FUs of the week.

1764
02:30:29,956 --> 02:30:33,318
[SPEAKER_03]: So send those in over private message to Sky in the chat room right now.

1765
02:30:33,399 --> 02:30:37,741
[SPEAKER_03]: This break, the theme is going to be DDR Euromix songs.

1766
02:30:37,781 --> 02:30:39,002
[SPEAKER_03]: The old school Euromix.

1767
02:30:39,542 --> 02:30:40,343
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be back.

1768
02:32:34,962 --> 02:32:35,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1769
02:33:27,899 --> 02:33:31,043
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing more than this Tell me one thing more than this

1770
02:35:27,475 --> 02:35:28,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1771
02:35:29,056 --> 02:35:31,198
[SPEAKER_03]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

1772
02:35:32,038 --> 02:35:41,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 66 in progress.

1773
02:35:41,445 --> 02:35:51,051
[SPEAKER_03]: After a little bit of a heated discussion about the bootleg machines versus the normal machines and da-da-da-da-da, I want to respond to a comment that came into the chat room while we were on break there.

1774
02:35:52,072 --> 02:35:54,914
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our new listeners, hello, Wampa164, had kind of a statement.

1775
02:35:57,279 --> 02:36:03,064
[SPEAKER_03]: What I like this, how you said that to the people, designing the DDR clone running on Linux, we're huge fucking nerds.

1776
02:36:03,525 --> 02:36:06,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet you're running a radio show that talks about DDR.

1777
02:36:06,127 --> 02:36:09,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it's a joke.

1778
02:36:10,471 --> 02:36:12,213
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're just, it's a joke.

1779
02:36:12,313 --> 02:36:19,179
[SPEAKER_03]: We make the joke, ha ha, Linux is a nerdy thing because most, you know, Joe Schmoes run Windows 95 and all that stuff and easy run stuff.

1780
02:36:19,500 --> 02:36:22,002
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, if it's programmed in Linux, it must be a nerdy thing.

1781
02:36:22,862 --> 02:36:24,943
[SPEAKER_03]: We realize we're big geeks and dorks.

1782
02:36:25,103 --> 02:36:26,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I take great pride in being a dork.

1783
02:36:27,223 --> 02:36:28,364
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing wrong with it.

1784
02:36:28,604 --> 02:36:30,544
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's nothing wrong with coding stuff in Linux either.

1785
02:36:30,824 --> 02:36:31,585
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a joke.

1786
02:36:31,865 --> 02:36:34,145
[SPEAKER_03]: So, please, don't take it too seriously, okay?

1787
02:36:34,846 --> 02:36:38,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, I'm making a fucking arcade cabinet for the house.

1788
02:36:39,727 --> 02:36:42,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how much more nerdy can you get?

1789
02:36:43,868 --> 02:36:46,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Look how much money this game has taken from us.

1790
02:36:46,189 --> 02:36:48,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Look how much weight I've lost playing it.

1791
02:37:11,559 --> 02:37:15,802
[SPEAKER_03]: But look, I would not be living in this apartment with Loki if it were not for DDR.

1792
02:37:16,462 --> 02:37:20,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not have Jamius, one of my best friends, if it were not for DDR.

1793
02:37:21,885 --> 02:37:26,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I would never have gotten Bradley to ever say a word, nor met him, if it had not been for DDR.

1794
02:37:26,108 --> 02:37:26,688
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1795
02:37:27,389 --> 02:37:30,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I met Bradley at AX playing DDR.

1796
02:37:31,731 --> 02:37:33,372
[SPEAKER_06]: On the Expo 2000, wasn't it?

1797
02:37:35,253 --> 02:37:37,855
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, he was that quiet guy standing there.

1798
02:37:40,224 --> 02:37:43,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Meanwhile, I'm over there in my Joe costume singing Xanadu.

1799
02:37:43,626 --> 02:37:45,267
[SPEAKER_03]: So, basically the point I want to make.

1800
02:37:45,728 --> 02:37:55,453
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR is obviously, if we've gone to the extent to make a show near and dear to our hearts, so we put a lot of fucking effort into it, despite what you may think, because our website's out of date and all that stuff.

1801
02:37:55,494 --> 02:37:59,616
[SPEAKER_03]: We put a lot of fucking effort into this station that nobody listens to.

1802
02:37:59,656 --> 02:38:00,977
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do it anyway because it's fun.

1803
02:38:04,151 --> 02:38:12,794
[SPEAKER_03]: When we have all these, so obviously we have some very strong opinions about DDR, and when DDR starts to go in a direction that we don't like, we knock it a little bit.

1804
02:38:12,934 --> 02:38:16,895
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like when Star Wars fans call Lucas an asshole because he does something they don't like.

1805
02:38:17,495 --> 02:38:20,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, when all is said and done, we fucking love Konami.

1806
02:38:20,336 --> 02:38:23,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me, there's a difference between Konami doing something we don't like and what Lucas did.

1807
02:38:23,817 --> 02:38:25,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm just trying to make a broad comparison.

1808
02:38:26,018 --> 02:38:27,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, we fucking love Konami.

1809
02:38:28,098 --> 02:38:31,019
[SPEAKER_03]: If it were not for Konami, we wouldn't have DDR, we wouldn't have all this great music.

1810
02:38:31,059 --> 02:38:33,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami Originals is some of the best music in DDR, but...

1811
02:38:33,593 --> 02:38:39,039
[SPEAKER_03]: When they make bad decisions, we're going to call them on it because they're affecting a game that means a lot to us.

1812
02:38:39,780 --> 02:38:41,341
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of the purpose behind this show.

1813
02:38:41,681 --> 02:38:53,734
[SPEAKER_03]: We slam DDR a lot on this show, but when all is said and done, we're only pointing out the flaws we see because the game means so much to us in the end.

1814
02:38:54,952 --> 02:38:55,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1815
02:38:57,753 --> 02:38:58,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, what was the other comment?

1816
02:38:58,733 --> 02:39:01,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be fair and kind of give the whole comments here.

1817
02:39:02,134 --> 02:39:15,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people commented that Konami doesn't care, but Monty went to pretty good lengths to listen to what the Konami community wanted with the public beta test and the poll they made to see that people wanted back, which might be primarily responsible for seeing Rhythm and Police again on a mix.

1818
02:39:15,837 --> 02:39:17,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, if you listened to the show a couple weeks ago...

1819
02:39:18,741 --> 02:39:21,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, Max 2 has the best licenses.

1820
02:39:21,763 --> 02:39:23,624
[SPEAKER_03]: They did listen to what the people want.

1821
02:39:23,804 --> 02:39:25,566
[SPEAKER_03]: People said, We Want Heaven by DJ Yano.

1822
02:39:25,586 --> 02:39:26,266
[SPEAKER_03]: They put it on there.

1823
02:39:26,326 --> 02:39:27,287
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty sweet song.

1824
02:39:28,047 --> 02:39:34,271
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, Konami of America doesn't completely fuck up one after another time.

1825
02:39:34,731 --> 02:39:41,456
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just kind of like what's frustrating sometimes is that Konami, when they do things, they do it so well, why won't they keep doing it?

1826
02:39:43,117 --> 02:39:44,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Why won't they make new mixes?

1827
02:39:44,518 --> 02:39:46,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, what were you saying?

1828
02:39:47,611 --> 02:39:47,831
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1829
02:39:48,752 --> 02:39:49,532
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think I said?

1830
02:39:49,612 --> 02:39:52,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here's what I don't understand, okay?

1831
02:39:53,235 --> 02:40:01,520
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole thing with DDR3, my mom was like, yes, they're going in the right direction, you know, they're getting input from the fans, no... Come in!

1832
02:40:03,862 --> 02:40:04,482
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello.

1833
02:40:04,703 --> 02:40:05,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

1834
02:40:05,763 --> 02:40:14,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, anyways, so they're getting input from the fans and everything, and they're like, oh yeah, we're starting over, we're doing this, and they're like, ha, no we're not, it's like...

1835
02:40:15,228 --> 02:40:16,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Giving the players blue balls.

1836
02:40:16,709 --> 02:40:17,650
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much what it is.

1837
02:40:17,710 --> 02:40:20,092
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you're getting them all psyched up for this new thing.

1838
02:40:20,372 --> 02:40:21,473
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just going to keep going.

1839
02:40:21,673 --> 02:40:24,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they're like, you know, we changed their minds.

1840
02:40:24,395 --> 02:40:25,676
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really want to do that anymore.

1841
02:40:27,217 --> 02:40:28,398
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really annoying.

1842
02:40:28,958 --> 02:40:30,159
[SPEAKER_03]: They frustrate the players.

1843
02:40:32,406 --> 02:40:32,686
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1844
02:40:34,307 --> 02:40:35,228
[SPEAKER_03]: So, bottom line.

1845
02:40:35,748 --> 02:40:36,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at us.

1846
02:40:36,589 --> 02:40:37,189
[SPEAKER_03]: We're dorks.

1847
02:40:37,589 --> 02:40:38,150
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't care.

1848
02:40:38,410 --> 02:40:41,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we have a radio station dedicated to DDR, and you know what?

1849
02:40:41,852 --> 02:40:42,632
[SPEAKER_03]: We like it that way.

1850
02:40:42,672 --> 02:40:48,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Because DDR has affected our lives so much, we feel the need to talk about it three hours a week, in some cases more, with our spinoff shows.

1851
02:40:49,977 --> 02:40:52,799
[SPEAKER_03]: So when DDR does something we don't like, we're going to point it out.

1852
02:40:54,119 --> 02:40:54,720
[SPEAKER_03]: End of story.

1853
02:40:55,436 --> 02:41:02,363
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to give our kind suggestions in a comical way because this is radio and we want you people to have something to listen to.

1854
02:41:02,403 --> 02:41:08,129
[SPEAKER_03]: If we were just sitting here, well, I see that we're going to have the new Max 2 out in a couple months.

1855
02:41:08,809 --> 02:41:09,910
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it would be boring.

1856
02:41:10,110 --> 02:41:13,193
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously we've got to say things that are going to piss people off because that's what radio is all about.

1857
02:41:13,213 --> 02:41:15,636
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be like watching Masterpiece Theater.

1858
02:41:15,796 --> 02:41:16,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1859
02:41:16,577 --> 02:41:16,837
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1860
02:41:17,297 --> 02:41:17,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're done.

1861
02:41:18,581 --> 02:41:19,281
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1862
02:41:42,955 --> 02:41:48,157
[SPEAKER_03]: We got so much on another tangent here that we didn't even announce the winner of the Orange Lounge Cage Match.

1863
02:41:48,517 --> 02:41:57,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is, tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge Cage Match, by quite a large margin I must say, is coming from a person who I don't think has won the Cage Match in a while.

1864
02:41:57,361 --> 02:41:58,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, your song won tonight.

1865
02:41:59,082 --> 02:41:59,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.

1866
02:41:59,962 --> 02:42:01,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Cyber X with Little Flower.

1867
02:42:01,663 --> 02:42:02,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1868
02:42:03,041 --> 02:42:03,641
[SPEAKER_06]: You love me.

1869
02:42:03,881 --> 02:42:04,962
[SPEAKER_06]: You all really love me.

1870
02:42:05,682 --> 02:42:07,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like going ferret squee.

1871
02:42:08,523 --> 02:42:09,583
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

1872
02:42:09,623 --> 02:42:10,183
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good song.

1873
02:42:10,203 --> 02:42:10,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad it won.

1874
02:42:11,143 --> 02:42:11,723
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, cool.

1875
02:42:11,764 --> 02:42:13,084
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's your winner for tonight's cage match.

1876
02:42:13,124 --> 02:42:14,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry I didn't announce it earlier.

1877
02:42:14,144 --> 02:42:17,185
[SPEAKER_03]: We got kind of sidetracked.

1878
02:42:17,205 --> 02:42:19,346
[SPEAKER_03]: That means I don't have to pick a song next week.

1879
02:42:19,826 --> 02:42:20,506
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1880
02:42:20,626 --> 02:42:26,768
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get into the FUs of the week, so we'll stop saying FU to Bomani and we'll say FU to some other stuff real fast.

1881
02:42:27,188 --> 02:42:30,889
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Jamie, why don't you explain the FUs of the week for those people who haven't listened before?

1882
02:42:31,513 --> 02:42:34,156
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where we get really pissed off and tell you about it.

1883
02:42:52,549 --> 02:42:56,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, first FU goes to my cough that will never go away.

1884
02:42:56,973 --> 02:42:58,535
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I've been cursed.

1885
02:42:59,156 --> 02:43:02,319
[SPEAKER_06]: So, fuck my lungs and my nose for being drippy.

1886
02:43:03,400 --> 02:43:06,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, although I really do like codeine a whole lot.

1887
02:43:07,043 --> 02:43:07,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1888
02:43:08,064 --> 02:43:12,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, another FU goes to, uh, being sick at work.

1889
02:43:13,409 --> 02:43:13,730
[SPEAKER_06]: And then...

1890
02:43:14,660 --> 02:43:24,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Another FU goes toward the attitude of some of my coworkers that I'm contagious, which is absolute bullshit because it's just a sinus infection, which is bacteria.

1891
02:43:24,762 --> 02:43:27,042
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to get a sinus infection, you're going to get it.

1892
02:43:29,883 --> 02:43:39,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Another one goes toward not having any PTO left over after my trip from Alabama because I had to use half of it to go to what would have been my remainder going to the doctor.

1893
02:43:42,259 --> 02:43:46,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Another one goes toward my car, still not being done yet, although they're making progress on it.

1894
02:43:48,705 --> 02:43:53,690
[SPEAKER_06]: The biggest one right now goes to this headache that just won't go away.

1895
02:43:53,710 --> 02:43:59,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that was pretty quick.

1896
02:44:00,756 --> 02:44:01,938
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because I'm in pain.

1897
02:44:03,459 --> 02:44:04,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Next up, Loki.

1898
02:44:09,525 --> 02:44:10,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm eating spaghetti.

1899
02:44:11,006 --> 02:44:11,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Dry spaghetti.

1900
02:44:13,107 --> 02:44:19,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, um, F you to stupid drivers, because, um, you go too damn slow.

1901
02:44:20,232 --> 02:44:22,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when I have to yell at you, and you don't hear me.

1902
02:44:23,333 --> 02:44:24,294
[SPEAKER_03]: That pisses me off too.

1903
02:44:24,994 --> 02:44:27,636
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course I should guess that you wouldn't hear me since my windows are down.

1904
02:44:28,416 --> 02:44:29,017
[SPEAKER_03]: But you should.

1905
02:44:29,417 --> 02:44:31,178
[SPEAKER_03]: You should see me angry and move out of my way.

1906
02:44:32,999 --> 02:44:35,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, F you to, uh,

1907
02:44:37,130 --> 02:44:59,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Walmart for having a Solo 2000, because Solo sucks, so, you suck, and F you to the DVD video that I had for calibrating my TV, it's very boring, so, yeah, that sucks, I expect it to be exciting, exciting, okay, with

1908
02:45:02,279 --> 02:45:06,281
[SPEAKER_06]: In defense of that video, it did have the electrocution and the fire and the alarm.

1909
02:45:08,343 --> 02:45:09,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that was funny.

1910
02:45:10,424 --> 02:45:14,666
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to Rob for encouraging the old Chinese lady for giving people out samples.

1911
02:45:15,007 --> 02:45:16,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I had her trained really well.

1912
02:45:16,307 --> 02:45:17,568
[SPEAKER_03]: She wasn't going to give me a sample.

1913
02:45:17,748 --> 02:45:19,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you had to fucking go and ask for a sample.

1914
02:45:20,250 --> 02:45:20,850
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it.

1915
02:45:20,930 --> 02:45:21,610
[SPEAKER_03]: What sample?

1916
02:45:23,692 --> 02:45:25,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1917
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:36,986
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it, F you the fact that we have to do these on Sunday because I'm more violent on Mondays when I'm pissed off at things, but now, like, I calm down by the weekend.

1918
02:45:37,667 --> 02:45:38,467
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not fair.

1919
02:45:39,668 --> 02:45:41,149
[SPEAKER_03]: So, whatever.

1920
02:45:41,289 --> 02:45:41,730
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

1921
02:45:41,930 --> 02:45:43,611
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have much more to complain about.

1922
02:45:44,572 --> 02:45:56,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, oh yeah, F you to stupid high school whores because, um, you suck and we know that you're gonna get knocked up and pregnant and have some STD and then, like, collect welfare, so you suck in advance.

1923
02:45:58,826 --> 02:45:59,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

1924
02:45:59,426 --> 02:45:59,567
[SPEAKER_16]: Um...

1925
02:46:28,473 --> 02:46:31,657
[SPEAKER_03]: and a continuing FU to Comcast, the worst cable company on the face of the earth.

1926
02:46:32,178 --> 02:46:33,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're fucking over a bunch of my friends.

1927
02:46:33,860 --> 02:46:35,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been reading a live journal this week.

1928
02:46:35,042 --> 02:46:37,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Comcast has been taking people offline and all this stuff.

1929
02:46:38,046 --> 02:46:40,129
[SPEAKER_03]: And worse yet, it's spreading.

1930
02:46:40,609 --> 02:46:42,292
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worse than Gator.

1931
02:46:42,412 --> 02:46:43,493
[SPEAKER_03]: It's spreading like a disease.

1932
02:46:43,613 --> 02:46:44,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and that reminds me.

1933
02:46:44,595 --> 02:46:45,696
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to lop.com.

1934
02:46:46,994 --> 02:46:48,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let Loki give the rest of this.

1935
02:46:49,316 --> 02:46:51,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Lop.com took over this guy's computer.

1936
02:46:51,677 --> 02:46:52,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't go there.

1937
02:46:52,538 --> 02:46:53,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God, don't go there.

1938
02:46:53,879 --> 02:46:55,260
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want this thing on your computer.

1939
02:46:55,340 --> 02:46:55,860
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awful.

1940
02:46:55,920 --> 02:46:56,941
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worse than Gator.

1941
02:46:57,321 --> 02:46:59,203
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like SARS for your computer.

1942
02:46:59,543 --> 02:47:00,504
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, two things.

1943
02:47:01,484 --> 02:47:02,645
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to Lop.com.

1944
02:47:03,025 --> 02:47:04,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not even Lop.com.

1945
02:47:04,326 --> 02:47:07,128
[SPEAKER_03]: It's some sort of spyware program that got on my computer from visiting.

1946
02:47:07,228 --> 02:47:08,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know what.

1947
02:47:08,870 --> 02:47:10,391
[SPEAKER_03]: It just somehow got on there.

1948
02:47:11,173 --> 02:47:16,656
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a bitch to get rid of because you remove it with all the adware programs out there and it will not remove it.

1949
02:47:16,696 --> 02:47:24,980
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way you can get rid of LOP is to go to their website, find the hidden link on there, and then download their uninstalled program and run it.

1950
02:47:25,880 --> 02:47:26,721
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only way.

1951
02:47:27,101 --> 02:47:29,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Also avoid the program No Adware.

1952
02:47:30,163 --> 02:47:32,964
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like called No Adware or something like that.

1953
02:47:33,804 --> 02:47:35,225
[SPEAKER_03]: It is adware itself.

1954
02:47:36,366 --> 02:47:36,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Irony.

1955
02:47:37,606 --> 02:47:40,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I still vouch for the Seek and Destroy program.

1956
02:47:40,627 --> 02:47:41,247
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good one.

1957
02:47:41,487 --> 02:47:42,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been using Attaware.

1958
02:47:42,567 --> 02:47:43,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Attaware works well, too.

1959
02:47:43,967 --> 02:47:50,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Attaware, and I have to use Attaware and then this one program called... Oh, I forget what it is.

1960
02:47:50,429 --> 02:47:52,829
[SPEAKER_06]: The Seek and Destroy one finds programs that Attaware doesn't.

1961
02:47:53,529 --> 02:48:01,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I stick with... I have about three different pop-up programs running at the same time to avoid any pop-ups and get some still sneak through, so...

1962
02:48:03,044 --> 02:48:04,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you what, it's all about Mozilla.

1963
02:48:05,526 --> 02:48:12,673
[SPEAKER_03]: If it weren't slow as shit, Mozilla would be the best, because you can block the pop-up blocking is smarter than anything I've ever used.

1964
02:48:12,913 --> 02:48:14,314
[SPEAKER_03]: LOP will get in the Mozilla.

1965
02:48:14,714 --> 02:48:18,338
[SPEAKER_03]: LOP affects Mozilla, Linux, and Microsoft Internet Explorer.

1966
02:48:19,999 --> 02:48:22,021
[SPEAKER_06]: I have found, though, that I haven't had...

1967
02:48:22,874 --> 02:48:29,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Nearly as much crap get on my computer since I've been using the Google Companion on Internet Explorer.

1968
02:48:30,040 --> 02:48:38,467
[SPEAKER_06]: It has the search engine, the pop-up blocker, and an individual word search by every title that you put in there.

1969
02:48:38,667 --> 02:48:47,214
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very, very intelligent little companion, and it effectively blocks just by the pop-up that'll come through in anything it tries to install on your computer.

1970
02:48:47,954 --> 02:48:49,816
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very effective, so I recommend it.

1971
02:48:49,836 --> 02:48:50,937
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get it right on Google.com.

1972
02:48:53,652 --> 02:48:57,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Bradley, you have any FUs you want to give him tonight?

1973
02:48:57,536 --> 02:48:58,156
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure, sure.

1974
02:48:58,857 --> 02:49:02,020
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck you to not having money, because that's why Calum P.S.

1975
02:49:02,040 --> 02:49:02,981
[SPEAKER_22]: had to take my stuff away.

1976
02:49:03,781 --> 02:49:11,028
[SPEAKER_22]: He actually had options for paying like 90 bucks or something, but I had like two payments on Monday that I just barely can cover.

1977
02:49:11,849 --> 02:49:16,353
[SPEAKER_22]: I had to let him take it away, and it'll take me like two months to get it back if I can ever get to that.

1978
02:49:17,447 --> 02:49:25,114
[SPEAKER_22]: and fuck you to not having money because there's Papa John's Pizza ad right in front of me and it makes me hungry for it, but I can't really afford it.

1979
02:49:25,554 --> 02:49:26,956
[SPEAKER_03]: You can turn it over if it helps.

1980
02:49:27,636 --> 02:49:30,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to buy Bradley Pizza?

1981
02:49:31,380 --> 02:49:32,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll buy Bradley Pizza one day.

1982
02:49:33,562 --> 02:49:34,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, that's very nice.

1983
02:49:34,082 --> 02:49:34,543
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, thank you.

1984
02:49:35,844 --> 02:49:36,545
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, uh...

1985
02:49:37,125 --> 02:49:50,694
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, fuck you to the time difference between this coast and the other coast, because I fucked it up when I was emailing a person I was supposed to do a phone interview with, and then she fucked it up too, so we're supposed to have like... And then Daylight Savings fucks it all up.

1986
02:49:50,994 --> 02:49:55,697
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, that doesn't really matter too much, but... No, I'm not strong-sided, you dip.

1987
02:49:56,778 --> 02:49:57,999
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not sad.

1988
02:49:58,699 --> 02:50:00,941
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't... I'm hardly ever proud about anything.

1989
02:50:03,129 --> 02:50:08,152
[SPEAKER_22]: I try to, I try to, I make it up sometimes, but I don't, I don't tell people about it.

1990
02:50:08,212 --> 02:50:11,294
[SPEAKER_22]: Just, he's trying to be funny and he's not, just ignore it.

1991
02:50:12,215 --> 02:50:14,456
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, well, he's trying to be funny.

1992
02:50:14,476 --> 02:50:16,778
[SPEAKER_22]: He'll be fine if he does it in Portuguese.

1993
02:50:17,178 --> 02:50:19,299
[SPEAKER_22]: Miserably, miserably, miserably horrible.

1994
02:50:19,319 --> 02:50:21,741
[SPEAKER_22]: And, okay, thank you to that.

1995
02:50:24,231 --> 02:50:31,560
[SPEAKER_22]: And then she said, oh, so I messed it up, so I'll have like 11 a.m.

1996
02:50:32,461 --> 02:50:33,142
[SPEAKER_22]: on Thursday.

1997
02:50:34,063 --> 02:50:38,929
[SPEAKER_22]: And so then, I think she called me at 11 a.m.

1998
02:50:38,969 --> 02:50:41,752
[SPEAKER_22]: her time, because of my run running at that time, but I couldn't get to it.

1999
02:50:42,881 --> 02:51:10,201
[SPEAKER_22]: and then now fuck you to Mailsweeper because her company uses that and it started thinking my emails were spam so I tried like four or five different times to get through and it kept from blocking them so I still need to call her to make sure that my last message got through which didn't seem to be blocked and hopefully it'll actually work out and actually talk to the person and then they can reject me for not being full of the customer service skills that they probably want

2000
02:51:12,996 --> 02:51:13,596
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see, what else?

2001
02:51:14,376 --> 02:51:14,956
[SPEAKER_22]: Anything else?

2002
02:51:15,837 --> 02:51:18,198
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck you to chairs that make too much noise.

2003
02:51:18,918 --> 02:51:24,420
[SPEAKER_22]: Because these hydraulic chairs, they're quiet at first, and then they start making noise on me for some reason.

2004
02:51:26,241 --> 02:51:31,363
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'll wrap it up so people can get to the chatroom and finish it up.

2005
02:51:33,024 --> 02:51:33,504
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it then?

2006
02:51:33,784 --> 02:51:33,984
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

2007
02:51:34,244 --> 02:51:34,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2008
02:51:35,305 --> 02:51:36,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on to the chatroom FUs.

2009
02:51:37,245 --> 02:51:38,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking A, there's a lot of them tonight.

2010
02:51:41,067 --> 02:51:44,269
[SPEAKER_03]: NoStylen says, My FU of the week is those people that think they're cars.

2011
02:51:44,309 --> 02:51:46,550
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, those people that ride the scooters and the motor ones.

2012
02:51:46,851 --> 02:51:48,672
[SPEAKER_03]: They get in front of you thinking they belong there.

2013
02:51:48,792 --> 02:51:51,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I go, um, get out of my way, you're not a bike, so go on the sidewalk.

2014
02:51:52,314 --> 02:51:54,695
[SPEAKER_03]: My next FU of the week is for my car not being fixed.

2015
02:51:54,775 --> 02:51:58,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, my next FU of the week is spending over $100 for art supplies.

2016
02:51:58,418 --> 02:52:00,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, FU for running out of ideas.

2017
02:52:00,719 --> 02:52:01,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I need more ideas.

2018
02:52:01,640 --> 02:52:02,640
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I'm sick.

2019
02:52:04,301 --> 02:52:04,841
[SPEAKER_03]: It got cut off.

2020
02:52:04,881 --> 02:52:05,582
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I'm sick.

2021
02:52:08,464 --> 02:52:08,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

2022
02:52:11,545 --> 02:52:15,287
[SPEAKER_03]: EvilNaoki2DX says, My only FU this week is homework.

2023
02:52:15,447 --> 02:52:16,227
[SPEAKER_03]: And hi, Ne-chan.

2024
02:52:18,848 --> 02:52:19,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Ne-chan.

2025
02:52:19,709 --> 02:52:20,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm a honky.

2026
02:52:20,949 --> 02:52:23,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Jazz says, I don't have an FU because I'm a happy little ho.

2027
02:52:24,210 --> 02:52:26,872
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU is that I don't have an FU because I'm a happy little ho.

2028
02:52:28,912 --> 02:52:31,293
[SPEAKER_03]: John Fields says, FU to humanity in general.

2029
02:52:32,074 --> 02:52:33,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, humans suck.

2030
02:52:34,875 --> 02:52:36,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Without humanity, you wouldn't exist.

2031
02:52:36,976 --> 02:52:38,557
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be in a world of nothingness.

2032
02:52:38,717 --> 02:52:39,297
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be a robot.

2033
02:52:40,787 --> 02:52:45,331
[SPEAKER_03]: 23rd Magus says, F you to people who think they know what's in my head and then proceed to put words in my mouth.

2034
02:52:46,171 --> 02:52:50,335
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to Solo2000, you suck, you don't deserve to exist, you are inferior, good day, sir.

2035
02:52:51,315 --> 02:52:56,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I disagree, six panel owns you, but whatever, you're entitled to your opinion, even if you're wrong.

2036
02:52:56,159 --> 02:53:00,202
[SPEAKER_03]: 23rd Magus continues to say, fuck not getting a call back from either Radio Shack or Papa Murphy's.

2037
02:53:00,563 --> 02:53:02,764
[SPEAKER_03]: How hard is it to email me or leave a fucking message?

2038
02:53:02,824 --> 02:53:03,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Die, K, thanks, bye.

2039
02:53:04,185 --> 02:53:05,646
[SPEAKER_03]: When they don't call you, you call them.

2040
02:53:06,607 --> 02:53:07,248
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my advice.

2041
02:53:12,315 --> 02:53:15,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Wampa164 says, F you to teenage kids.

2042
02:53:17,798 --> 02:53:23,201
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't drive, but think they have and deserve more rights and have no respect for their elders anymore.

2043
02:53:23,541 --> 02:53:24,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, fuck it.

2044
02:53:26,182 --> 02:53:27,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Kids today.

2045
02:53:29,215 --> 02:53:33,557
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Alcoholic says, as usual, I don't have any real FUs, so I won't bother with digging down deep to find one.

2046
02:53:33,597 --> 02:53:42,401
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I do have to say, I miss my honey bunches of old Dark Child, who's away in Arizona because he's... Oh, well, this is serious reason.

2047
02:53:43,181 --> 02:53:45,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Here I am making fun of her, and it's a pretty serious reason why he's in Arizona.

2048
02:53:47,042 --> 02:53:51,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I just make fun of the cute stuff, but Dark Child's away in Arizona because his grandma passed away.

2049
02:53:53,365 --> 02:53:55,606
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's been gone for two weeks, so I miss him, boo-hoo.

2050
02:53:56,066 --> 02:53:57,587
[SPEAKER_03]: He comes back Thursday, though, so yeah...

2051
02:53:58,553 --> 02:53:59,573
[SPEAKER_03]: We're sorry to hear about that.

2052
02:54:01,374 --> 02:54:04,676
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm only teasing you because I make fun of happy things in the FUs of the week.

2053
02:54:06,416 --> 02:54:09,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Mintz says, FU to my college, I'll leave it at that.

2054
02:54:09,118 --> 02:54:10,918
[SPEAKER_03]: There's too much stuff to go into specifics.

2055
02:54:11,499 --> 02:54:13,740
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to anyone going to my college who is an IT major.

2056
02:54:13,780 --> 02:54:16,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all dumb fucks that deserve the piss-poor future you're gonna get.

2057
02:54:21,452 --> 02:54:24,655
[SPEAKER_03]: LankyStyle says, F you to people who use the word asshat.

2058
02:54:24,715 --> 02:54:26,656
[SPEAKER_03]: The word is lame and annoying in my opinion.

2059
02:54:26,776 --> 02:54:27,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh shit, I just said it.

2060
02:54:28,197 --> 02:54:29,298
[SPEAKER_03]: God, you're an asshat.

2061
02:54:29,338 --> 02:54:30,539
[SPEAKER_03]: God, stop being such an asshat.

2062
02:54:31,560 --> 02:54:33,562
[SPEAKER_03]: You are wearing your ass as a hat.

2063
02:54:34,022 --> 02:54:34,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop being an asshat.

2064
02:54:40,187 --> 02:54:43,730
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to the person who suggested switching Vanilla Sky with Orange Lounge Radio.

2065
02:54:43,970 --> 02:54:45,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm not coming in on Sunday evenings.

2066
02:54:45,831 --> 02:54:46,532
[SPEAKER_03]: You switch them.

2067
02:54:47,886 --> 02:54:49,167
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Monday and Tuesday.

2068
02:54:49,947 --> 02:54:50,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

2069
02:54:50,748 --> 02:54:58,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody else is saying that, remember how Loki said that he should do Mondays, or Loki said that he'd be better at the FUs if they were on Mondays?

2070
02:54:58,112 --> 02:54:59,373
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be really inconvenient.

2071
02:54:59,393 --> 02:55:00,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Mondays, no.

2072
02:55:00,413 --> 02:55:01,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Mondays are my night.

2073
02:55:01,554 --> 02:55:02,074
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't have them.

2074
02:55:02,274 --> 02:55:03,955
[SPEAKER_06]: This song is really inconvenient, too.

2075
02:55:04,475 --> 02:55:08,518
[SPEAKER_03]: LankyStyle also says, oh, and in tradition, FU to this segment because I don't like it.

2076
02:55:09,138 --> 02:55:12,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Irene has an FU for playing a stupid barber because she hates it, but she's weird like that.

2077
02:55:12,620 --> 02:55:14,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, cry me a river.

2078
02:55:19,045 --> 02:55:21,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

2079
02:55:23,334 --> 02:55:25,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Snub Dysphonoid says, Fuck.

2080
02:55:29,707 --> 02:55:30,828
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not reading that one.

2081
02:55:30,868 --> 02:55:32,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, that's across the line a little bit.

2082
02:55:33,009 --> 02:55:36,911
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to the stupid high school whores that kept screaming about how good I was at DDR.

2083
02:55:36,951 --> 02:55:38,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for announcing it to the fucking world.

2084
02:55:38,872 --> 02:55:39,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

2085
02:55:39,673 --> 02:55:40,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Other folks don't care.

2086
02:55:40,734 --> 02:55:44,536
[SPEAKER_03]: So why the fuck do you have to scream about how I got four grades on 1998 extra stage?

2087
02:55:44,856 --> 02:55:45,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

2088
02:55:45,416 --> 02:55:47,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't appreciate it and I hope you get pregnant.

2089
02:55:49,839 --> 02:55:51,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Then that means there'll be more of them.

2090
02:55:52,218 --> 02:56:00,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Fat old fuck you goes to the nasty smelling shit logs to take my turn on initial D. Hey, how about I take a fucking broken bottle to your head, then we'll see how badly you want my turn.

2091
02:56:00,600 --> 02:56:03,141
[SPEAKER_03]: You suck shit anyway, and you don't deserve life to begin with.

2092
02:56:03,221 --> 02:56:04,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, there's a lot of anger in here.

2093
02:56:06,682 --> 02:56:09,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's initial D, why are you getting concerned anyway?

2094
02:56:11,043 --> 02:56:12,243
[SPEAKER_06]: After his, I have another one.

2095
02:56:13,635 --> 02:56:14,316
[SPEAKER_03]: We're almost done.

2096
02:56:14,957 --> 02:56:16,920
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting the last, the straggling FUs now.

2097
02:56:16,940 --> 02:56:19,022
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means I'm turning the music off because these are stragglers.

2098
02:56:19,683 --> 02:56:24,470
[SPEAKER_03]: EvilNaoki2DX has one last FU to his USB wireless adapter for blue screening my system.

2099
02:56:27,862 --> 02:56:31,623
[SPEAKER_03]: and Wampa would also like to say F you to MTV for being a piece of shit.

2100
02:56:32,003 --> 02:56:35,104
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't even play music but brainwash our youth and corrupt them to shit.

2101
02:56:36,605 --> 02:56:41,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Similarly, F you to the same teenage kids that can't drive but instead ride their shitty racer scooters.

2102
02:56:42,287 --> 02:56:46,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Lastly, F you to midterms from Stapler X. That's it, last one, no more.

2103
02:56:47,529 --> 02:56:51,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to add that I just forgot what I was going to say.

2104
02:56:53,778 --> 02:56:54,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Way to go!

2105
02:56:54,919 --> 02:56:56,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I remember what it is.

2106
02:56:56,059 --> 02:56:59,481
[SPEAKER_06]: This stupid bitch on the Ragnarok Online community on LiveJournal.

2107
02:57:00,342 --> 02:57:01,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Her account got banned.

2108
02:57:02,283 --> 02:57:03,624
[SPEAKER_06]: And her husband's account got banned.

2109
02:57:04,924 --> 02:57:05,305
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know...

2110
02:57:06,127 --> 02:57:08,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the thing is they don't know and Gravity's not replying back.

2111
02:57:09,409 --> 02:57:14,253
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing is, though, I understand that I would be upset if my account were banned.

2112
02:57:16,134 --> 02:57:23,719
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently she did not check the ban list to see if it was a temporary ban or a permanent ban.

2113
02:57:24,239 --> 02:57:28,082
[SPEAKER_06]: She did not stop to think that because they've recently been hacked...

2114
02:57:29,362 --> 02:57:34,485
[SPEAKER_06]: This could be a maintenance issue and that their accounts will be reinstated once they've completed whatever it is that they're doing.

2115
02:57:36,105 --> 02:57:41,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead, she's acting rude to everybody on the list and acting like this is her life.

2116
02:57:42,468 --> 02:57:43,549
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a stupid game.

2117
02:57:44,069 --> 02:57:47,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you think we're assholes when it comes to DDR, go look at this community.

2118
02:57:49,056 --> 02:57:55,538
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, I would be upset, like I said, I'd be upset if I was unjustly banned, if I didn't do anything.

2119
02:57:56,458 --> 02:58:00,740
[SPEAKER_06]: But she was just being really rude and nasty to people with no reason to do it.

2120
02:58:01,020 --> 02:58:10,383
[SPEAKER_06]: When they were offering legitimate suggestions, things that she can do, the different solutions to her problem, but all that she wanted to do was bitch.

2121
02:58:11,298 --> 02:58:19,482
[SPEAKER_06]: about the service, and she didn't even take any of the proper steps to be sure that it was indeed, you know, a true banning.

2122
02:58:19,662 --> 02:58:21,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, it didn't have to do with the maintenance or anything.

2123
02:58:22,223 --> 02:58:23,564
[SPEAKER_06]: This person was so stupid.

2124
02:58:23,904 --> 02:58:36,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Just go to LiveJournal.com, users slash Wagner Rock online, and it's probably one of the older ones now, but she's a really stupid bitch and needs to be slapped upside her head.

2125
02:58:37,971 --> 02:58:38,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Just for being stupid.

2126
02:58:39,393 --> 02:58:41,936
[SPEAKER_06]: She doesn't deserve her Ragnarok online anyway if she's that addicted to it.

2127
02:58:41,956 --> 02:58:43,097
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you going to slap her with your dick?

2128
02:58:44,539 --> 02:58:45,340
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have one.

2129
02:58:45,880 --> 02:58:47,202
[SPEAKER_21]: If you had your hypothetical dick.

2130
02:58:47,742 --> 02:58:49,625
[SPEAKER_21]: I would slap her with... Your internet penis.

2131
02:58:49,805 --> 02:58:51,387
[SPEAKER_21]: I would slap her with the Red Bull cock.

2132
02:58:52,429 --> 02:58:54,651
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

2133
02:58:55,191 --> 02:59:01,435
[SPEAKER_21]: Speaking of LiveJournal, Orange Lounge has a LiveJournal community that is posted in once in a great while.

2134
02:59:01,475 --> 02:59:04,357
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, actually, we've got quite a few people watching it.

2135
02:59:04,838 --> 02:59:08,400
[SPEAKER_21]: There's some news and some questions that get asked on there.

2136
02:59:10,001 --> 02:59:12,203
[SPEAKER_21]: It's username OrangeLounge, all one word.

2137
02:59:13,018 --> 02:59:14,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and there is a DDR one.

2138
02:59:15,059 --> 02:59:18,920
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually the LiveJournal community, Bimani.

2139
02:59:20,100 --> 02:59:23,881
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's also a DDR one, but it's kind of... No one updates it.

2140
02:59:24,081 --> 02:59:25,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Just look for the Bimani one.

2141
02:59:26,802 --> 02:59:29,203
[SPEAKER_06]: And on Dead Journal, there's DDR Maniacs.

2142
02:59:31,703 --> 02:59:32,404
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, pretty cool.

2143
02:59:34,156 --> 02:59:36,798
[SPEAKER_21]: While we're winding down the show here, we're getting into the home stretch.

2144
02:59:36,838 --> 02:59:38,219
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, is there anything we missed?

2145
02:59:38,839 --> 02:59:40,800
[SPEAKER_21]: You and I had tons of topics we wanted to talk about tonight.

2146
02:59:40,820 --> 02:59:43,282
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there any last-minute things we forgot to talk about?

2147
02:59:43,302 --> 02:59:44,323
[SPEAKER_21]: We did the UPN story.

2148
02:59:44,363 --> 02:59:48,605
[SPEAKER_21]: We did the ranting about the bootleg machines and the new games and all that stuff.

2149
02:59:50,426 --> 02:59:50,987
[SPEAKER_21]: He's thinking.

2150
02:59:51,527 --> 02:59:52,888
[SPEAKER_21]: He's off in La La Land.

2151
02:59:52,908 --> 02:59:55,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

2152
02:59:58,563 --> 02:59:59,644
[SPEAKER_21]: Alter Mix goes gold.

2153
02:59:59,704 --> 03:00:01,045
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought that was kind of old news.

2154
03:00:01,105 --> 03:00:01,465
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

2155
03:00:01,506 --> 03:00:04,027
[SPEAKER_21]: Alter Mix comes out on the 18th of November.

2156
03:00:04,208 --> 03:00:08,431
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be when I'm in... No, I think I'll be... Aren't you coming back right about then?

2157
03:00:09,932 --> 03:00:11,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to look at a calendar.

2158
03:00:12,294 --> 03:00:13,054
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.

2159
03:00:13,114 --> 03:00:14,595
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's about the time I'm going to be back.

2160
03:00:14,856 --> 03:00:14,996
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2161
03:00:15,196 --> 03:00:16,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh, oh, I have happy news.

2162
03:00:17,338 --> 03:00:17,598
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2163
03:00:17,698 --> 03:00:19,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God, that hurt.

2164
03:00:19,819 --> 03:00:21,741
[SPEAKER_06]: For old school gamers... Okay.

2165
03:00:22,261 --> 03:00:26,865
[SPEAKER_06]: There is... For anyone who remembers on the Sega Saturn, the Sega Ages collection...

2166
03:00:28,105 --> 03:00:38,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in the U.S., they released multiple games on one disc, but in Japan, each game was released individually, like Space Harrier, you know, all those.

2167
03:00:38,447 --> 03:00:47,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're doing Sega Ages 2500, which basically, for the PS2, it's remakes of old Sega games that were supposed to sell for 2,500 yen, about 23-something.

2168
03:00:47,669 --> 03:00:48,529
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've released Space Harrier.

2169
03:00:56,491 --> 03:01:01,276
[SPEAKER_06]: which I ordered, Fantasy Zone which is my second favorite game ever and so I ordered that too.

2170
03:01:01,757 --> 03:01:03,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Fantasy Star was a really nice remake.

2171
03:01:05,300 --> 03:01:06,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the three that I ordered.

2172
03:01:06,341 --> 03:01:12,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the other two that are out right now is Monaco GP and Golden Axe.

2173
03:01:13,328 --> 03:01:21,355
[SPEAKER_06]: So the best prices I've seen for our most reliable site is toysnjoys.com, T-O-Y-S-N-J-O-Y-S.com.

2174
03:01:21,795 --> 03:01:22,856
[SPEAKER_06]: They're located in Hawaii.

2175
03:01:22,876 --> 03:01:23,737
[SPEAKER_06]: They have really fast shipping.

2176
03:01:24,618 --> 03:01:25,639
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're selling it for $25.

2177
03:01:27,901 --> 03:01:33,265
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just had to make the mention for all the old school people because it's really neat that they're doing that.

2178
03:01:33,585 --> 03:01:33,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2179
03:01:36,246 --> 03:01:36,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Joy of Joys

2180
03:02:03,442 --> 03:02:04,022
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.

2181
03:02:04,082 --> 03:02:06,123
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a song that's in DDR.

2182
03:02:06,143 --> 03:02:07,163
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a new mix.

2183
03:02:07,243 --> 03:02:11,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but is that some fanboy's wet dream, or is that something that's actually been documented somewhere?

2184
03:02:11,245 --> 03:02:11,645
[SPEAKER_03]: It's documented.

2185
03:02:11,665 --> 03:02:12,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, was that announced somewhere?

2186
03:02:12,625 --> 03:02:13,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was announced.

2187
03:02:13,625 --> 03:02:15,086
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2188
03:02:15,106 --> 03:02:16,086
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR UK is all over it.

2189
03:02:17,527 --> 03:02:17,767
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

2190
03:02:18,367 --> 03:02:19,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I believe anything they say.

2191
03:02:21,308 --> 03:02:23,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're pretty on top of it for Euromix.

2192
03:02:23,589 --> 03:02:24,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2193
03:02:24,969 --> 03:02:27,230
[SPEAKER_03]: For most DDR news sites, they're pretty respectable.

2194
03:02:27,550 --> 03:02:30,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, they've got the UK end covered.

2195
03:02:34,966 --> 03:02:35,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

2196
03:02:37,010 --> 03:02:40,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if that's all the news you got, I guess we can go ahead and wrap up the show here.

2197
03:02:40,235 --> 03:02:43,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's all the news I can think of.

2198
03:02:44,178 --> 03:02:45,278
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2199
03:02:45,319 --> 03:02:48,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around and see what everybody's... Oh, and Jamie would like this.

2200
03:02:48,420 --> 03:02:51,721
[SPEAKER_03]: They're selling second mix machines on eBay right now, a couple of them.

2201
03:02:53,142 --> 03:02:53,642
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

2202
03:02:53,662 --> 03:02:54,242
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't like $4,000.

2203
03:02:54,342 --> 03:02:58,024
[SPEAKER_03]: It was some insane amount you could get an extreme machine for.

2204
03:02:58,524 --> 03:03:02,766
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing is that Dan and I have sat down and talked about what made it official.

2205
03:03:03,026 --> 03:03:04,407
[SPEAKER_06]: We're buying our house in the spring.

2206
03:03:05,868 --> 03:03:08,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, next spring we're buying our house.

2207
03:03:08,631 --> 03:03:10,793
[SPEAKER_06]: We will have a house and we will have a DDR machine.

2208
03:03:12,195 --> 03:03:13,957
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing is, we're probably going to have an extreme.

2209
03:03:14,697 --> 03:03:15,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not a second mix?

2210
03:03:16,479 --> 03:03:18,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you can't grade a second mix.

2211
03:03:20,203 --> 03:03:21,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Get bootleg third.

2212
03:03:22,265 --> 03:03:23,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Korean, third Korean.

2213
03:03:23,487 --> 03:03:24,668
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I do not want the third.

2214
03:03:24,908 --> 03:03:26,470
[SPEAKER_06]: If I get a third mix, it's going to be a third plus.

2215
03:03:27,408 --> 03:03:27,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

2216
03:03:28,309 --> 03:03:28,629
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2217
03:03:29,530 --> 03:03:31,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2218
03:03:31,532 --> 03:03:32,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the show's wrapping up.

2219
03:03:32,533 --> 03:03:34,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley, we'll start with Bradley, our guest for this evening.

2220
03:03:34,975 --> 03:03:36,436
[SPEAKER_03]: He hasn't said much, but that's okay.

2221
03:03:37,377 --> 03:03:38,297
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what he's known for.

2222
03:03:40,059 --> 03:03:40,359
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

2223
03:03:40,719 --> 03:03:43,161
[SPEAKER_22]: Be active, not passive.

2224
03:03:43,341 --> 03:03:47,185
[SPEAKER_22]: Let my performance today be an example of what not to do.

2225
03:03:50,549 --> 03:03:51,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, final thought.

2226
03:03:51,710 --> 03:03:53,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be done with my cabinet this week.

2227
03:03:54,873 --> 03:03:55,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't you say that last week?

2228
03:03:56,895 --> 03:03:57,936
[SPEAKER_03]: No, really this time.

2229
03:03:57,956 --> 03:03:59,618
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, really.

2230
03:03:59,918 --> 03:04:00,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear I'm going to be done.

2231
03:04:01,159 --> 03:04:02,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, with part of it at least.

2232
03:04:02,821 --> 03:04:06,645
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be done with the major cutting of the cabinet.

2233
03:04:06,665 --> 03:04:11,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Will we actually have a wooden, empty cabinet at the end of this week?

2234
03:04:11,790 --> 03:04:12,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly.

2235
03:04:12,610 --> 03:04:13,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking...

2236
03:04:14,412 --> 03:04:16,333
[SPEAKER_03]: The battery power is the only thing stopping me.

2237
03:04:16,854 --> 03:04:18,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I have, like, all the sheets I have.

2238
03:04:18,615 --> 03:04:19,896
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't take the power!

2239
03:04:20,356 --> 03:04:23,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, all the sheets I have left to cut are just rectangular.

2240
03:04:23,298 --> 03:04:25,520
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, it's not anything complex or anything.

2241
03:04:26,160 --> 03:04:27,561
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's just putting it together.

2242
03:04:27,742 --> 03:04:28,782
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much it.

2243
03:04:29,423 --> 03:04:30,944
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not much left.

2244
03:04:32,425 --> 03:04:34,086
[SPEAKER_03]: So, maybe.

2245
03:04:34,246 --> 03:04:35,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we'll have a cabinet by the end of the week.

2246
03:04:35,847 --> 03:04:36,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

2247
03:04:36,828 --> 03:04:37,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be waiting.

2248
03:04:39,030 --> 03:04:40,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, your final thought.

2249
03:04:41,972 --> 03:04:42,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Ow!

2250
03:04:42,172 --> 03:04:42,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Ow!

2251
03:04:45,365 --> 03:04:51,268
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is I'm so happy I only have to work two days next week.

2252
03:04:51,688 --> 03:04:52,468
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes me giddy.

2253
03:04:52,928 --> 03:04:54,069
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't have to work a full week.

2254
03:04:54,949 --> 03:04:57,550
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't exactly call what I do work, but sure.

2255
03:04:57,630 --> 03:05:00,771
[SPEAKER_06]: I get two weeks off in a row, huh?

2256
03:05:00,791 --> 03:05:01,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Blimey.

2257
03:05:01,612 --> 03:05:01,972
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2258
03:05:02,772 --> 03:05:03,233
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

2259
03:05:03,373 --> 03:05:04,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Final word of the show tonight.

2260
03:05:06,454 --> 03:05:08,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Nellie, you want to take a stab at one word, Nellie?

2261
03:05:08,795 --> 03:05:09,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you say one word?

2262
03:05:10,155 --> 03:05:10,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one?

2263
03:05:10,996 --> 03:05:11,376
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2264
03:05:11,396 --> 03:05:11,436
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2265
03:05:14,967 --> 03:05:17,349
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2266
03:05:17,809 --> 03:05:21,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

2267
03:05:22,092 --> 03:05:23,953
[SPEAKER_03]: We expect you a nice play again.

2268
03:05:24,434 --> 03:05:27,195
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2269
03:06:13,667 --> 03:06:15,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.

2270
03:06:45,766 --> 03:06:49,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio, The Afterbirth, the part after the credits have faded out.

2271
03:06:50,807 --> 03:06:54,088
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of WTF to tonight's fortune cookie, Jamie.

2272
03:06:54,148 --> 03:06:54,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Explain yourself.

2273
03:06:56,168 --> 03:07:11,091
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going through my waves and I could not decide on one, so I picked the Sailor Stars transformation from the last season of Sailor Moon, in Japanese, of course, which I actually thought was a pretty good series because they killed Chibiusa.

2274
03:07:12,421 --> 03:07:13,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Except they bought in Chibi Chibi.

2275
03:07:14,382 --> 03:07:15,582
[SPEAKER_06]: And she needed to die too.

2276
03:07:16,283 --> 03:07:18,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I was a Sailor Moon fan once.

2277
03:07:19,564 --> 03:07:21,425
[SPEAKER_06]: When it was like new.

2278
03:07:24,426 --> 03:07:26,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched a couple episodes of it once.

2279
03:07:26,947 --> 03:07:28,388
[SPEAKER_06]: You watched the crap version.

2280
03:07:29,188 --> 03:07:33,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I have like, I can show you some quality Sailor Moon.

2281
03:07:36,731 --> 03:07:38,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Quality Sailor Moon, isn't that a bit of a, no.

2282
03:07:40,453 --> 03:07:41,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Tuxedo Mask.

2283
03:07:43,960 --> 03:07:48,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Tuxedo Common But the guy they have playing him in the live action series is ugly!

2284
03:07:49,442 --> 03:07:50,162
[SPEAKER_03]: He's ugly!

2285
03:07:50,242 --> 03:07:52,182
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care what everybody else is going to say, he's ugly!

2286
03:07:54,503 --> 03:07:58,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anything else you guys want to say in this little portion after the credits have faded here?

2287
