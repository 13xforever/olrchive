Thank you for watching!

Thanks for watching!

3
00:01:25,013 --> 00:01:26,095
Thanks for watching!

00:01:54,763 --> 00:01:56,144

Thank you for watching!

7
00:03:34,912 --> 00:03:39,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

8
00:03:42,717 --> 00:03:47,641
[SPEAKER_18]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, where Monty talks and then some.

9
00:03:48,321 --> 00:03:51,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

10
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:55,486
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

11
00:03:56,087 --> 00:04:00,870
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

12
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:05,264
[SPEAKER_17]: You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

13
00:04:05,564 --> 00:04:07,025
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I will spank your child.

14
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:09,187
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

15
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:16,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's to my big opening.

16
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,752
[SPEAKER_06]: A sphincter says what?

17
00:04:18,032 --> 00:04:20,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm super, thanks for asking.

18
00:04:20,413 --> 00:04:23,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

19
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,396
[SPEAKER_03]: What am I doing here?

20
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Dodge this.

21
00:04:25,436 --> 00:04:25,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

22
00:04:28,755 --> 00:04:30,615
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a tasty burger.

23
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:33,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.

24
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:34,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I have.

25
00:04:34,576 --> 00:04:36,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, just a flesh wound.

26
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:42,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.

27
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:44,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah?

28
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:48,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

29
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,460
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura.

30
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,660
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a Smith.

31
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Sky.

32
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,641
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

33
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:54,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

34
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:55,821
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate you.

35
00:04:56,181 --> 00:04:58,202
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio Arts.

36
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,405
[SPEAKER_08]: We are live!

37
00:05:03,265 --> 00:05:06,246
[SPEAKER_08]: This is episode number 64 for October the 12th of 2003.

38
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:14,308
[SPEAKER_08]: You're tuned in to the Beemani-themed, most cream-filled station of all things Beemani.

39
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:15,528
[SPEAKER_21]: That's full of suck.

40
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,309
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Skye.

41
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:21,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.

42
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,430
[SPEAKER_08]: In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers.

43
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,790
[SPEAKER_08]: You know her better as DarkSakura.

44
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,611
[SPEAKER_21]: Never eat reduced-fat oatmeal cream cookies, because they suck.

45
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:29,871
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get into that in a little while.

46
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Also with us tonight, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

47
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:36,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

48
00:05:37,723 --> 00:05:38,244
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

49
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:39,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

50
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:40,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

51
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:43,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Also with us tonight, we have some guests.

52
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:49,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Starting off with... Surprise me.

53
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:51,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone.

54
00:05:51,854 --> 00:05:52,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Bradley.

55
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:53,676
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing?

56
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:58,379
[SPEAKER_06]: I have faced the evil reduced fat cookie of death and I have survived.

57
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,241
[SPEAKER_08]: And all I got was this crappy t-shirt.

58
00:06:03,205 --> 00:06:05,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, let's say hello to 23rd Magus.

59
00:06:05,405 --> 00:06:10,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I really need to stop listening to Travis, because every time I see you, you're always like, I'm gay!

60
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:12,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

61
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:19,309
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, remind me to save that sound clip for the next intro, whenever we introduce Andrew.

62
00:06:26,113 --> 00:06:28,155
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be talking to everybody more a little bit later.

63
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,715
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a lot of news to talk about.

64
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:36,259
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR Extreme, where Matt's arcade cabinet stands.

65
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio goes to the movies.

66
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:40,641
[SPEAKER_08]: And plenty more.

67
00:06:40,962 --> 00:06:41,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually went to the movies, too.

68
00:06:41,982 --> 00:06:42,522
[SPEAKER_08]: When we come back.

69
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:45,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I went to the movies, too, actually.

70
00:06:45,944 --> 00:06:46,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you?

71
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:48,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you see the same movie we all saw?

72
00:06:48,085 --> 00:06:48,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes, I did.

73
00:06:49,406 --> 00:06:50,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then you get to talk with us.

74
00:06:51,451 --> 00:06:52,612
[SPEAKER_21]: That movie owns my soul.

75
00:06:52,652 --> 00:06:53,352
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back.

76
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:53,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't spoil it.

77
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:54,893
[SPEAKER_21]: And part of my intestines.

78
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:55,653
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back.

79
00:06:56,514 --> 00:06:58,795
[SPEAKER_08]: First, we're going to play a song from the new V-Rare album.

80
00:06:58,955 --> 00:07:00,696
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a long version of Drop Ta-Bomb.

81
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:05,018
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll hear Un De Trois from Max Extreme.

82
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:06,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch your mouth.

83
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:07,760
[SPEAKER_08]: I called it Max Extreme.

84
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,141
[SPEAKER_08]: From DDR Extreme Consumer.

85
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:10,501
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

86
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:10,962
[SPEAKER_21]: Like 1, 2, 3?

87
00:07:11,462 --> 00:07:12,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, like 1, 2, 3 in French.

[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft meets Ecstasy

101
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:14,276
Mr. Random Person on the street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge being on a music and more show?

102
00:11:14,296 --> 00:11:14,636
The music?

103
00:11:37,555 --> 00:11:43,578
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

104
00:11:43,918 --> 00:11:45,919
[SPEAKER_19]: It's unearthly.

105
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:49,880
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

106
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:53,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

107
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:57,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Hope you enjoyed that.

108
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,565
[SPEAKER_08]: And drop the bomb, the long mix.

109
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:05,432
[SPEAKER_08]: from the V-Rare album, the brand new one that just came out with DDR Extreme in Japan.

110
00:12:05,612 --> 00:12:07,453
[SPEAKER_21]: I think you broke the camera with that cookie.

111
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:07,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

112
00:12:08,053 --> 00:12:20,002
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're wondering what happened to the Orange Lounge Radio DDR Extreme premiere show, well, I ordered my copy of Extreme a little later than some of you, and therefore we won't be getting it until Tuesday.

113
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:21,083
[SPEAKER_21]: I forgot to order mine.

114
00:12:21,183 --> 00:12:23,284
[SPEAKER_08]: So we won't be doing the show until Wednesday.

115
00:12:23,504 --> 00:12:24,965
[SPEAKER_21]: Oops, because I'm going to Alabama.

116
00:12:26,106 --> 00:12:26,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

117
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:27,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, when do you leave for Alabama?

118
00:12:28,328 --> 00:12:28,768
[SPEAKER_21]: Next month.

119
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:29,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Next month.

120
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:30,642
[SPEAKER_08]: We're still a little ways away.

121
00:12:30,882 --> 00:12:31,863
[SPEAKER_21]: But I had to buy my ticket.

122
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:35,845
[SPEAKER_08]: We just did the math, though, and you're going to be missing episode 69, which makes me cry.

123
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,867
[SPEAKER_21]: Unless you put us on hiatus.

124
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:41,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Put the show on hiatus, never.

125
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,251
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, we want to go to Golfland on Sunday.

126
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:47,473
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, let's just pre-record the show.

127
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:50,255
[SPEAKER_21]: No, we don't want the show on hiatus.

128
00:12:50,455 --> 00:12:51,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember those days.

129
00:12:53,277 --> 00:12:54,697
[SPEAKER_21]: I will pick my replacement.

130
00:12:55,498 --> 00:12:56,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you're going to handpick a replacement?

131
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,799
[SPEAKER_21]: I will pick my replacement.

132
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

133
00:13:03,687 --> 00:13:04,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Just be gentle while you're picking.

134
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,031
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, right.

135
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,553
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll break out the asbestos gloves.

136
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:19,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I originally had told our chat room earlier in the week, for those of you guys that lurk in our chat room 24-7, get a life.

137
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,161
[SPEAKER_08]: No, just kidding.

138
00:13:20,181 --> 00:13:20,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kidding.

139
00:13:20,661 --> 00:13:20,981
[SPEAKER_08]: We love it.

140
00:13:22,322 --> 00:13:30,309
[SPEAKER_08]: I did say originally Monday because I thought that's what day I was going to get it, but I actually checked the UPS thing and it's not going to get here until Tuesday because UPS is slower than I remember.

141
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:32,275
[SPEAKER_08]: And it takes two days to get here, not one.

142
00:13:32,335 --> 00:13:34,136
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are actually going to be getting it on Tuesday.

143
00:13:34,676 --> 00:13:37,117
[SPEAKER_08]: But because of Jamie's show, we're not going to play it until Wednesday.

144
00:13:37,218 --> 00:13:39,639
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's when the DDR Extreme premiere show will be.

145
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:40,399
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be Wednesday.

146
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much of a premiere, I know, because many of you have already played it.

147
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:47,343
[SPEAKER_08]: But I know a lot of you guys don't have access to Japanese PlayStation 2s.

148
00:13:47,423 --> 00:13:48,924
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe you're a little curious about the game.

149
00:13:48,944 --> 00:13:55,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Because details have been a little... Details about the new DDR Extreme... You know, all the stuff we really want to know about has come out.

150
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:56,708
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the hidden songs?

151
00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:57,809
[SPEAKER_08]: What do they sound like?

152
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:58,609
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the non-stop versions?

153
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:03,909
[SPEAKER_08]: All little things haven't really been talked about, so we'll be doing that on our webcam as well.

154
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:05,289
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the TV hooked up to the webcam.

155
00:14:05,729 --> 00:14:12,171
[SPEAKER_08]: The little things, the cool things, the information mode things that we can't read, but will be funny anyway, I'm sure.

156
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:13,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

157
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,152
[SPEAKER_08]: You're supposed to promote the program.

158
00:14:19,452 --> 00:14:19,852
[SPEAKER_21]: Yay.

159
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:21,733
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm excited.

160
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:27,914
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm ordering my next week, because I have to buy a ticket to see Alan Jackson.

161
00:14:29,372 --> 00:14:32,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you buying a ticket willingly to go to a country concert?

162
00:14:32,255 --> 00:14:33,696
[SPEAKER_21]: Because my mom wants to go.

163
00:14:33,716 --> 00:14:35,597
[SPEAKER_08]: It's her birthday.

164
00:14:35,998 --> 00:14:39,841
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like when I was going to buy my mom a ticket to see Celine Dion in Vegas.

165
00:14:40,602 --> 00:14:42,684
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I realized I don't want to contribute to that.

166
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:45,926
[SPEAKER_21]: Your mom likes Celine Dion.

167
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:47,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, my mom loves Celine Dion.

168
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,150
[SPEAKER_08]: You know who else my mom likes a lot?

169
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Barbara Streisand.

170
00:14:51,811 --> 00:14:54,073
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry, but is she tone deaf?

171
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:57,056
[SPEAKER_08]: My mom also bought the Rosie O'Donnell Christmas album.

172
00:15:00,138 --> 00:15:04,821
[SPEAKER_21]: But Celine Dion can't sing for shit.

173
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:07,883
[SPEAKER_21]: The only good song she did was like by Meatloaf.

174
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:10,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Meatloaf's cool.

175
00:15:11,065 --> 00:15:11,946
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, he was Eddie.

176
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:16,809
[SPEAKER_08]: I see Maren is in our chat room and she's going to Alabama with you.

177
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,151
[SPEAKER_08]: And she says, I don't have to go to Alan Jackson.

178
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:19,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha ha.

179
00:15:19,992 --> 00:15:20,992
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll make you go.

180
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:22,133
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll buy your damn ticket.

181
00:15:22,994 --> 00:15:23,654
[SPEAKER_21]: Just watch.

182
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:25,776
[SPEAKER_21]: You're coming to see Alan Jackson and Biloxi with us.

183
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:50,147
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm probably going to leave her over at Mama Sun Ha ha, you opened your mouth Anyway I love that smiley Usually at the top of the show we talk about how was your day, how was your week But today I wanted to be a little different Let's talk about Orange Lounge Radio Goes to the Movies

184
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:51,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

185
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:51,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

186
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:51,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:51,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

00:15:52,207 --> 00:15:52,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

189
00:16:18,726 --> 00:16:24,567
[SPEAKER_21]: is different blood effects of various types, whether it be CG or liquid.

190
00:16:26,108 --> 00:16:27,488
[SPEAKER_21]: Blood in various colors.

191
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:29,329
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, no CG.

192
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:41,332
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, there's still various different types of blood effects, like everything from the squirt to the splatter to the animated to the blood.

193
00:16:41,692 --> 00:16:42,912
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, it was blood.

194
00:16:43,812 --> 00:16:45,233
[SPEAKER_21]: Lots, lots, lots, lots of it.

195
00:16:45,293 --> 00:16:46,373
[SPEAKER_21]: Most of the movie was in Japanese.

196
00:16:47,668 --> 00:16:53,069
[SPEAKER_21]: And there were puns in the movie, and if you don't really understand Japanese, then you won't get them.

197
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:56,530
[SPEAKER_21]: So I was there laughing in the theater, and people were giving me weird looks.

198
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:57,890
[SPEAKER_21]: That was great.

199
00:16:59,911 --> 00:17:01,831
[SPEAKER_21]: And then, like, the people in the theater were funny, too.

200
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:12,453
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, I'm not going to say what the scene was, but there was this one particular really awesome scene, and it gets really quiet, and this guy's back's like, whoa, and everybody busts it up.

201
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,521
[SPEAKER_21]: And the whole movie was just fantastic.

202
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:22,162
[SPEAKER_08]: On a scale of 1 to 10?

203
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:24,504
[SPEAKER_21]: 5,000 million.

204
00:17:25,204 --> 00:17:26,985
[SPEAKER_21]: Which is just one point short of Battle Royale.

205
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:29,246
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

206
00:17:30,407 --> 00:17:33,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what did you think of Kill Bill, Volume 1?

207
00:17:33,628 --> 00:17:34,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I already knew it was going to be good.

208
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:36,450
[SPEAKER_07]: I already read the script beforehand.

209
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,270
[SPEAKER_08]: You little pirate.

210
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:39,892
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't pirate the script.

211
00:17:39,952 --> 00:17:40,572
[SPEAKER_07]: It was online.

212
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:41,232
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, whatever.

213
00:17:42,873 --> 00:17:45,575
[SPEAKER_07]: How can I be a pirate if it was readily available online?

214
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:45,915
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

215
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:48,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it readily available from Miramax?

216
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:53,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Did Miramax distribute the script, or did some little kid find it and put it out for everybody to download?

217
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:54,195
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

218
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:56,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because it's on the internet doesn't mean it's legal.

219
00:17:57,196 --> 00:17:57,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

220
00:17:58,957 --> 00:18:01,038
[SPEAKER_09]: It was at Moviesource.com.

221
00:18:02,618 --> 00:18:06,500
[SPEAKER_09]: But, anyways, it was pretty, it was good.

222
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,080
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked it.

223
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,381
[SPEAKER_09]: It was everything I thought it was going to be, so, yeah.

224
00:18:10,782 --> 00:18:11,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

225
00:18:12,103 --> 00:18:13,083
[SPEAKER_08]: On a scale of one to ten?

226
00:18:13,103 --> 00:18:13,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Ten.

227
00:18:14,142 --> 00:18:14,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, good.

228
00:18:14,763 --> 00:18:14,843
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 10.

229
00:18:15,103 --> 00:18:16,404
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Oscar material.

230
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:18,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

231
00:18:18,726 --> 00:18:19,967
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see that ever happening.

232
00:18:20,848 --> 00:18:21,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, come on.

233
00:18:21,348 --> 00:18:22,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Pulp Fiction.

234
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:23,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

235
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at that.

236
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:25,952
[SPEAKER_07]: See?

237
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,934
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a little different than Pulp Fiction.

238
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Pulp Fiction was different.

239
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:31,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it doesn't matter because you know what?

240
00:18:32,297 --> 00:18:33,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Pulp Fiction had way more dialogue than this movie.

241
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,141
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not distributing screens for the small titles, so they're not going to win.

242
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:37,522
[SPEAKER_09]: So, ha, it's going to win.

243
00:18:38,142 --> 00:18:41,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Pulp Fiction had way more dialogue than this movie did.

244
00:18:42,046 --> 00:18:44,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Pulp Fiction used the F word about... I counted one time.

245
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:47,887
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Pulp Fiction has the F word in it 256 times.

246
00:18:48,687 --> 00:18:50,268
[SPEAKER_08]: And this movie had it maybe... 40?

247
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:55,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because there's that... But there was blood.

248
00:18:55,429 --> 00:18:56,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I know there was blood.

249
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:59,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine each blood spurt as another fuck.

250
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,470
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

251
00:19:05,651 --> 00:19:07,671
[SPEAKER_21]: That was a pair of the suckiest throws ever.

252
00:19:09,351 --> 00:19:10,992
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way... You throw like a girl.

253
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:11,452
[SPEAKER_21]: There...

254
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:15,579
[SPEAKER_21]: There are two tie-ins, by the way, to Battle Royale, not just one.

255
00:19:16,219 --> 00:19:19,580
[SPEAKER_21]: Other than, what was her name, Kuriyama Chiaki?

256
00:19:20,361 --> 00:19:22,301
[SPEAKER_08]: The chick who plays Chinguisa.

257
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:25,262
[SPEAKER_21]: You're saying Lingui-sa, which is Italian.

258
00:19:25,422 --> 00:19:26,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Chinguisa.

259
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,463
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it, sorry.

260
00:19:27,963 --> 00:19:29,344
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, that's her, but there's another one.

261
00:19:30,184 --> 00:19:38,567
[SPEAKER_21]: In the animated sequence, the girl's voice actor is Maeda Ai, who played the girl at the very beginning of Battle Royale with the blood all over her face.

262
00:19:38,847 --> 00:19:39,367
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, cool.

263
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:41,948
[SPEAKER_21]: And who is in Battle Royale, too.

264
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:43,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

265
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:43,816
[SPEAKER_21]: Yay.

266
00:19:44,636 --> 00:19:48,559
[SPEAKER_21]: And for other anime fans, Midori Kawa's in it.

267
00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:50,440
[SPEAKER_21]: You can tell him by his nasally-ass voice.

268
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,481
[SPEAKER_21]: So, here we go.

269
00:19:52,622 --> 00:19:54,583
[SPEAKER_08]: And there is an anime sequence.

270
00:19:54,603 --> 00:19:56,024
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably about ten minutes long.

271
00:19:56,164 --> 00:19:58,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was done by... It was done by the folks at Ghost in the Shell, right?

272
00:19:59,426 --> 00:20:01,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was done by... What studio was it?

273
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:02,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Studio Gonzo.

274
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:05,490
[SPEAKER_07]: That studio did that.

275
00:20:08,116 --> 00:20:16,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, my review of Kill Bill was, it was, okay, this is, this is the interesting thing because every geek I know just totally fucking loved this movie.

276
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:22,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I've been reading LiveJournal over the weekend and stuff and all my geek friends who saw it was like, this is the coolest movie ever.

277
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:27,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's an homage, it's a, it pays homage to everything geek.

278
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:30,223
[SPEAKER_08]: It is just like a tribute to everything geek.

279
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:37,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it is, and, and this is the thing is that Tarantino is a fan of like everything that we talk about on this show.

280
00:20:37,816 --> 00:20:49,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, when I was watching the movie, I knew Jamie was just going to be wet watching this movie because I could see all these influences from, like, all of her favorite things that she never shuts up about, like Battle Royale and the anime and all that stuff.

281
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:52,142
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was just like, oh, Jamie's going to be loving this when she sees it.

282
00:20:52,422 --> 00:20:54,563
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really loved it, too, because I like all that stuff, too.

283
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:55,963
[SPEAKER_08]: And the blood was great.

284
00:20:56,263 --> 00:20:59,825
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um... What?

285
00:21:03,526 --> 00:21:03,867
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

286
00:21:04,607 --> 00:21:05,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And the spanking.

287
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:07,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was just thinking that, too.

288
00:21:07,819 --> 00:21:09,120
[SPEAKER_08]: That was one of the best.

289
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to spoil it, but that was the best thing in the whole movie.

290
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:14,362
[SPEAKER_08]: And the pussy wagon.

291
00:21:14,702 --> 00:21:15,402
[SPEAKER_15]: The pussy wagon.

292
00:21:15,702 --> 00:21:16,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

293
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:16,703
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

294
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:17,083
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

295
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:17,963
[SPEAKER_08]: I won't say anything else.

296
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:19,784
[SPEAKER_08]: On a scale of 1 to 10, what?

297
00:21:22,485 --> 00:21:25,687
[SPEAKER_08]: On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 10.1.

298
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:27,847
[SPEAKER_21]: I win.

299
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:29,508
[SPEAKER_21]: 50 million.

300
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:31,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Does Bradley have anything you want to say about Kill Bill?

301
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it was cool.

302
00:21:35,551 --> 00:21:36,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I enjoyed it.

303
00:21:37,403 --> 00:21:41,905
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I can't really add anything because people say it the most.

304
00:21:41,985 --> 00:21:43,966
[SPEAKER_06]: I was kind of sitting there.

305
00:21:44,566 --> 00:21:45,827
[SPEAKER_06]: So I give it a 10 because it was really cool.

306
00:21:45,987 --> 00:21:46,367
[SPEAKER_08]: You can give it a 10.

307
00:21:46,427 --> 00:21:47,368
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

308
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:48,769
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have to see it again sometime.

309
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:52,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Andrew, I know you haven't seen it, but what would you give it on a scale of 1 to 10?

310
00:21:54,671 --> 00:21:58,093
[SPEAKER_12]: Based on what Jamie goes, 25 million.

311
00:21:58,573 --> 00:22:00,674
[SPEAKER_12]: And if everyone in this room gives me a dollar, I can go see it.

312
00:22:01,495 --> 00:22:02,215
[SPEAKER_08]: How about no?

313
00:22:02,695 --> 00:22:03,376
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what?

314
00:22:03,896 --> 00:22:06,157
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll give you those sucky cookies to sell on eBay.

315
00:22:12,027 --> 00:22:19,890
[SPEAKER_21]: God damn, am I the only person who knows how to throw a microphone?

316
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, were you guys going to go see it again tonight after the show?

317
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:22,171
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

318
00:22:22,731 --> 00:22:23,472
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh.

319
00:22:23,992 --> 00:22:24,572
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be down.

320
00:22:24,732 --> 00:22:25,853
[SPEAKER_21]: Dork boy has a way home.

321
00:22:26,313 --> 00:22:26,793
[SPEAKER_21]: But we'll go.

322
00:22:27,093 --> 00:22:27,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go.

323
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:28,294
[SPEAKER_08]: We should go.

324
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:28,934
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's go.

325
00:22:29,394 --> 00:22:29,714
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry.

326
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:32,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Call your dad and tell him you're staying out late tonight.

327
00:22:32,295 --> 00:22:33,215
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to see Kill Bill again.

328
00:22:34,356 --> 00:22:34,876
[SPEAKER_08]: After the show.

329
00:22:35,596 --> 00:22:37,477
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go catch a 10 o'clock showing in Fulton or something.

330
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we'll figure something out.

331
00:22:43,921 --> 00:22:44,361
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe later.

332
00:22:44,381 --> 00:22:46,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to go after the show?

333
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:46,722
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

334
00:22:46,942 --> 00:22:47,983
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to see it three more times.

335
00:22:48,383 --> 00:22:49,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, we'll go see it.

336
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:51,444
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I only saw Freddy vs. Jason twice.

337
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:52,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

338
00:22:52,824 --> 00:22:55,085
[SPEAKER_21]: So I definitely have to see Kill Bill four times.

339
00:22:56,926 --> 00:23:00,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Explain Jamie's rating system by how many times she watches a movie.

340
00:23:00,607 --> 00:23:04,249
[SPEAKER_21]: If I really like a movie, then, see, four is my favorite number.

341
00:23:05,229 --> 00:23:09,711
[SPEAKER_21]: This is where my small bit of obsessive compulsive disorder sneaks in.

342
00:23:10,327 --> 00:23:11,348
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

343
00:23:36,365 --> 00:23:37,346
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'm thinking?

344
00:23:37,806 --> 00:23:46,711
[SPEAKER_08]: The most number of times, not counting Rocky Horror Picture Show, that's an exception obviously, but not counting Rocky Horror Picture Show, the most number of times I've seen a movie in the theater is three.

345
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,973
[SPEAKER_08]: And I saw Titanic three times in the theater.

346
00:23:51,074 --> 00:23:51,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Dork.

347
00:23:51,914 --> 00:23:52,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Just don't ask.

348
00:23:52,795 --> 00:23:53,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I got dragged by different people.

349
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:56,797
[SPEAKER_08]: And I saw Shakespeare in Love three times in the theater.

350
00:23:57,987 --> 00:23:59,848
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think I need to see Kill Bill four times.

351
00:24:00,228 --> 00:24:05,410
[SPEAKER_21]: This started back with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie.

352
00:24:06,771 --> 00:24:08,531
[SPEAKER_21]: Which I've seen in the theater four times.

353
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:11,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2, The Secret of the Ooze, four times?

354
00:24:11,512 --> 00:24:12,053
[SPEAKER_21]: I saw it twice.

355
00:24:13,353 --> 00:24:14,974
[SPEAKER_21]: I saw the third one twice as well.

356
00:24:16,535 --> 00:24:17,895
[SPEAKER_10]: The third one was cool.

357
00:24:18,135 --> 00:24:19,176
[SPEAKER_21]: The third one was just neat.

358
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:20,496
[SPEAKER_21]: The third one was cool.

359
00:24:21,216 --> 00:24:21,637
[SPEAKER_21]: Shut up.

360
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:27,459
[SPEAKER_21]: I've seen Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey four times in the theater.

361
00:24:28,755 --> 00:24:54,294
[SPEAKER_21]: I've seen Harry Potter and Chamber of Secrets four times in the theater because I didn't actually see I wasn't into Harry Potter when the first movie came out I've seen Freddy vs. Jason twice I've seen now there was one movie I saw six times in the theater and I forgot what it was just because I kept having to go with people and I didn't like the movie but that doesn't fall into my rating system Titanic I've seen The Matrix twice in the theater

362
00:24:56,383 --> 00:24:59,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, anyway, I thought we could all give our little review on it.

363
00:25:01,046 --> 00:25:01,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Andrew, just go with us.

364
00:25:02,707 --> 00:25:03,567
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll cover you somehow.

365
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:04,047
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll help you.

366
00:25:04,308 --> 00:25:05,869
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll take pity on your poor, pathetic soul.

367
00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:06,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we'll take pity on you.

368
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,651
[SPEAKER_21]: Because you're going to be offering it up to Tarantino anyway.

369
00:25:09,671 --> 00:25:11,852
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get into an R-rated movie all by yourself now, huh?

370
00:25:12,352 --> 00:25:12,853
[SPEAKER_21]: Yay!

371
00:25:14,173 --> 00:25:16,595
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it feel to be a big boy?

372
00:25:18,276 --> 00:25:21,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we, can you, wait, Andrew, will you stand up and pose on our webcam real fast?

373
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:22,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Will you stand in front of the cam?

374
00:25:22,858 --> 00:25:23,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I want to read your shirts.

375
00:25:24,244 --> 00:25:26,365
[SPEAKER_08]: because your shirt, I swear it's like reading a novel right here.

376
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:29,027
[SPEAKER_21]: Stan, you don't read many books, do you?

377
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:29,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

378
00:25:30,548 --> 00:25:33,250
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to read this for you guys who can't see it on the cam because it's kind of blurry.

379
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,651
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, Mom, Dad, I'm so sorry.

380
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:41,095
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you told me not to have anybody in the house while you were away, but when my friends stopped by, I had to let them in.

381
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:42,556
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't planned or anything.

382
00:25:42,836 --> 00:25:44,437
[SPEAKER_08]: I certainly wouldn't call it a party.

383
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:48,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, I have no idea how the band got here or why the police were called.

384
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really, really sorry about the house, but that's why we have insurance, right?

385
00:25:53,191 --> 00:25:55,332
[SPEAKER_08]: How many times do you get stopped so people can read that shirt?

386
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:58,754
[SPEAKER_12]: More times than people stop to talk to me.

387
00:26:02,697 --> 00:26:04,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that your way of getting attention?

388
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:08,580
[SPEAKER_21]: We need to get him the shirt that you got me.

389
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,301
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate my life.

390
00:26:11,382 --> 00:26:12,242
[SPEAKER_21]: I hate my life.

391
00:26:12,342 --> 00:26:15,884
[SPEAKER_21]: Every day I polish my revolver and I shoot my head like a rock star.

392
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:22,388
[SPEAKER_21]: This 80 year old lady stopped me in the grocery store to read my shirt and said it was the funniest thing she's ever seen in her life.

393
00:26:30,532 --> 00:26:42,339
[SPEAKER_21]: and then while the rest of us are at Scandia lamenting it evil place why should we go to ARC for DDR?

394
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:52,366
[SPEAKER_08]: you're like one of the only people that sticks up for this little community college with a DDR machine and I have no interest in going to college to play DDR but I'm curious to hear why you love it so much

395
00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:56,212
[SPEAKER_12]: It's cheap, it's loud, they've got all the unlocks, it's in perfect condition.

396
00:26:56,392 --> 00:26:57,693
[SPEAKER_12]: They keep it in perfect condition.

397
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:01,494
[SPEAKER_12]: If it isn't in perfect condition, I damn well beat their asses for it.

398
00:27:01,514 --> 00:27:04,335
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, okay, somebody fix the pad, now.

399
00:27:05,195 --> 00:27:06,096
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what they need to do?

400
00:27:06,356 --> 00:27:11,737
[SPEAKER_08]: They need to put DDR machines next to military drafting boards.

401
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:15,199
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be the ultimate military idea.

402
00:27:16,459 --> 00:27:16,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

403
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:21,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Get stupid, nerdy people in there, trick them into going there, and then they're in the military.

404
00:27:23,471 --> 00:27:26,672
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to basic trick maniac them into the military.

405
00:27:26,692 --> 00:27:30,952
[SPEAKER_09]: That was really dumb.

406
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Really dumb.

407
00:27:32,173 --> 00:27:34,093
[SPEAKER_08]: I just brought this show to a screeching halt.

408
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:34,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazing.

409
00:27:35,013 --> 00:27:39,774
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm sure you would probably say that you pulled a magus, but I can't do that.

410
00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:41,614
[SPEAKER_12]: It would sound better in Portuguese.

411
00:27:43,034 --> 00:27:47,095
[SPEAKER_21]: Especially since someone took your joke book so that they could wipe their ass.

412
00:27:49,056 --> 00:27:51,236
[SPEAKER_21]: If anyone's been keeping up with my board, hello.

413
00:27:52,762 --> 00:27:54,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you like to give your board a plug?

414
00:27:54,683 --> 00:27:55,123
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

415
00:27:55,483 --> 00:27:56,904
[SPEAKER_21]: It needs to be plugged into the wall.

416
00:27:56,964 --> 00:27:57,965
[SPEAKER_21]: It has some life in it.

417
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:00,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I posted on your board this week.

418
00:28:00,986 --> 00:28:03,127
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and the puzzle pirate said that nobody reads.

419
00:28:03,588 --> 00:28:05,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I read it.

420
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:07,950
[SPEAKER_21]: It's roleplay.darksakura.com.

421
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,952
[SPEAKER_21]: There is no www in front of it, so don't be stupid and put it in front of there.

422
00:28:11,512 --> 00:28:13,813
[SPEAKER_21]: Just roleplay.darksakura.com.

423
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,014
[SPEAKER_21]: It's that easy.

424
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:15,794
[SPEAKER_21]: Sign up for it.

425
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:17,295
[SPEAKER_21]: Become one with the nerdiness.

426
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:23,807
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move into how was your week, how was your day, because I want to hear how your guys' week and your day was.

427
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:25,488
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Jamie, how was your week, how was your day?

428
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,828
[SPEAKER_21]: Week sucked.

429
00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:38,792
[SPEAKER_21]: I had like a really bad night within the week, which was alleviated by some strategically IM'd cat pictures.

430
00:28:41,213 --> 00:28:45,874
[SPEAKER_21]: And I was just really kind of crappy all week.

431
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:47,695
[SPEAKER_21]: And I had a really good day Friday.

432
00:28:48,137 --> 00:28:51,738
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I was really disappointed because Dan was like, I don't want to go to the movie.

433
00:28:52,038 --> 00:28:53,339
[SPEAKER_21]: So I was like, well, fine.

434
00:28:54,139 --> 00:29:01,582
[SPEAKER_21]: So, um, basically what happened Friday is, okay, last week was customer service week all week, which was kind of neat.

435
00:29:02,162 --> 00:29:06,524
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, Thursday was what is your favorite decade day, so I dressed all 80s, it was great.

436
00:29:07,644 --> 00:29:10,866
[SPEAKER_21]: And, uh, played, you know, Duran Duran in my cubicle all day.

437
00:29:12,086 --> 00:29:16,968
[SPEAKER_21]: And then, uh, Thursday, not Thursday, but Friday, I, uh,

438
00:29:18,263 --> 00:29:19,644
[SPEAKER_21]: They fed us spaghetti.

439
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:23,867
[SPEAKER_21]: My supervisor cooked it, and she makes really good spaghetti.

440
00:29:24,407 --> 00:29:28,150
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I get home, and I'm like, Okay, Dan, we're going to go see Kill Bill, right?

441
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,931
[SPEAKER_21]: And he's like, Uh, I cooked you dinner.

442
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,773
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, how nice.

443
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:33,554
[SPEAKER_21]: He cooked spaghetti.

444
00:29:34,735 --> 00:29:35,896
[SPEAKER_21]: He's had spaghetti twice.

445
00:29:36,796 --> 00:29:37,737
And so I went to the...

446
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:45,544
[SPEAKER_21]: I went to the store and bought some garlic bread and some real parmesan cheese.

447
00:29:46,984 --> 00:29:49,306
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't like the powder parmesan cheese?

448
00:29:49,346 --> 00:29:50,967
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to have the actual cheese?

449
00:29:51,007 --> 00:29:54,149
[SPEAKER_21]: Since I've had real parmesan cheese, I have to have real parmesan cheese every time.

450
00:29:55,229 --> 00:29:57,891
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm such a snob when it comes to what I put on my food.

451
00:29:59,191 --> 00:30:00,612
[SPEAKER_21]: You cheese elitist.

452
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,933
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't bite my ass.

453
00:30:02,493 --> 00:30:03,354
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll show you cheese.

454
00:30:05,015 --> 00:30:05,375
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

455
00:30:05,395 --> 00:30:08,577
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't.

456
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:13,870
[SPEAKER_21]: I would not have eaten that cookie if I had known what it was to begin with.

457
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:15,951
[SPEAKER_21]: That cookie deceived me.

458
00:30:17,391 --> 00:30:19,712
[SPEAKER_21]: That cookie is fucking evil.

459
00:30:19,732 --> 00:30:23,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you provide our listeners with a little bit of backstory on the cookies that suck?

460
00:30:24,714 --> 00:30:25,154
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

461
00:30:27,154 --> 00:30:28,535
[SPEAKER_21]: I love oat milk cream cookies.

462
00:30:29,215 --> 00:30:30,295
[SPEAKER_21]: Very, very, very much.

463
00:30:31,236 --> 00:30:37,037
[SPEAKER_21]: And I usually go to the dollar store and buy the generic ones that have real cream in them, not this marshmallow crap.

464
00:30:37,057 --> 00:30:39,098
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I hate marshmallows

465
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,700
[SPEAKER_21]: So much.

466
00:30:41,321 --> 00:30:42,521
[SPEAKER_21]: Because the texture just sucks.

467
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,442
[SPEAKER_21]: The only way I will eat a marshmallow is if it's on fire.

468
00:30:44,462 --> 00:30:45,863
[SPEAKER_21]: Flames on the side of my face.

469
00:30:46,604 --> 00:30:47,084
[SPEAKER_21]: Heaving.

470
00:30:47,504 --> 00:30:48,265
[SPEAKER_21]: Breath heaving.

471
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:48,645
[SPEAKER_21]: Shut up.

472
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:50,606
[SPEAKER_21]: Shut up.

473
00:30:50,926 --> 00:30:51,586
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't tease me.

474
00:30:52,707 --> 00:30:53,668
[SPEAKER_21]: By the way, you're turning purple.

475
00:30:54,468 --> 00:30:54,788
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

476
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:56,189
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't see.

477
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,470
[SPEAKER_21]: You're getting retarded.

478
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,430
[SPEAKER_10]: I love you.

479
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,171
[SPEAKER_10]: You love me.

480
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you said purple, not retarded.

481
00:31:03,973 --> 00:31:04,013
Um.

482
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,661
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing to throw.

483
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:11,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Finish your story.

484
00:31:13,783 --> 00:31:15,504
[SPEAKER_08]: No, do not throw the cookie you suck.

485
00:31:16,404 --> 00:31:16,664
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

486
00:31:17,885 --> 00:31:18,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that hit my tummy.

487
00:31:21,227 --> 00:31:22,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, where's the ferrets?

488
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:23,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob?

489
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:25,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not know.

490
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,770
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, whatever.

491
00:31:28,532 --> 00:31:33,595
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway... Anyway, um... We get to the checkout counter at Walmart.

492
00:31:35,976 --> 00:31:37,057
[SPEAKER_21]: You totally missed.

493
00:31:37,757 --> 00:31:38,037
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway...

494
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:41,492
[SPEAKER_21]: We got to the checkout counter at Walmart.

495
00:31:42,432 --> 00:31:48,534
[SPEAKER_21]: And I am delighted and thrilled to see oatmeal cream cookies on the Little Debbie snack bar.

496
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,814
[SPEAKER_21]: So I... What is that?

497
00:31:52,315 --> 00:31:53,435
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a baked potato.

498
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:55,295
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm sorry.

499
00:31:55,396 --> 00:31:56,576
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Bake-O-Bits.

500
00:31:56,696 --> 00:31:58,836
[SPEAKER_21]: Smells like artificial pork.

501
00:31:59,637 --> 00:31:59,997
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

502
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:03,258
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

503
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:07,599
[SPEAKER_21]: I grab the box and I hug the box as excited as I am.

504
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:10,319
[SPEAKER_21]: and I freaking... She did, I was there.

505
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,300
[SPEAKER_21]: I fucked... I fucked... You fucked the box.

506
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,620
[SPEAKER_21]: I fucked the box.

507
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:21,822
[SPEAKER_21]: I forked over the money for this... You're eating bacon bits out of the box?

508
00:32:21,902 --> 00:32:22,442
[SPEAKER_21]: My God.

509
00:32:23,982 --> 00:32:24,622
[SPEAKER_21]: Tell your story.

510
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:29,743
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, I forked over the money to get this thing of oatmeal cream pie things.

511
00:32:29,863 --> 00:32:30,463
[SPEAKER_21]: Get in the car.

512
00:32:30,883 --> 00:32:32,464
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm halfway through the cookie, mind you.

513
00:32:33,444 --> 00:32:34,584
[SPEAKER_21]: These things are too chewy.

514
00:32:36,584 --> 00:32:37,624
[SPEAKER_21]: These things suck.

515
00:32:37,784 --> 00:32:38,705
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't taste the cream.

516
00:32:39,685 --> 00:32:41,666
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh my God, it's marshmallow.

517
00:32:42,566 --> 00:32:42,746
[SPEAKER_21]: Ew.

518
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:45,187
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we look at the box and it reduces fat and I'm like, oh well shit.

519
00:32:46,827 --> 00:32:50,248
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I gave one to, I had Rob eat one.

520
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,309
[SPEAKER_21]: And Rob agrees with me that they're the worst cookies ever.

521
00:32:53,729 --> 00:32:53,990
[SPEAKER_21]: Right?

522
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:55,530
[SPEAKER_21]: Sucks.

523
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,991
[SPEAKER_21]: So we decided that we were going to come back and make everybody else eat them.

524
00:33:00,392 --> 00:33:01,592
[SPEAKER_21]: And we've been successful so far.

525
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:09,865
[SPEAKER_06]: This reminds me, there's one part in Kill Bill where there's a cereal box called Kaboom.

526
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:15,686
[SPEAKER_06]: I remembered it from when I was like five to ten years old.

527
00:33:15,706 --> 00:33:16,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

528
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:18,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I hated that cereal.

529
00:33:19,027 --> 00:33:22,608
[SPEAKER_06]: We grabbed it one day and it was the worst cereal that I ever had tasted.

530
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:26,029
[SPEAKER_06]: So we took one bite and we basically threw out the box.

531
00:33:27,829 --> 00:33:31,010
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the throwback moment from that.

532
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,570
[SPEAKER_21]: They need to make shirts.

533
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,979
[SPEAKER_21]: with old cereal boxes on them, like Mr. T Cereal?

534
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:39,621
[SPEAKER_21]: I want a shirt with Mr. T Cereal on the front.

535
00:33:40,341 --> 00:33:42,942
[SPEAKER_21]: Or the Nintendo Breakfast System.

536
00:33:46,104 --> 00:33:47,925
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, it's for breakfast now.

537
00:33:51,507 --> 00:33:53,388
[SPEAKER_21]: Why is it... I feel really old.

538
00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:02,013
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, you were still... It was earlier than that.

539
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:05,609
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

540
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:11,412
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, nobody can hear what you're saying anyway, so shut up.

541
00:34:13,953 --> 00:34:21,576
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, you know what, I've noticed that so many things from when I was younger are making a big comeback now.

542
00:34:22,816 --> 00:34:27,378
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, like, you know, they're doing all the re-releases of Transformers.

543
00:34:28,038 --> 00:34:31,720
[SPEAKER_21]: I have my Season 3 box set now, and it's only the first half of it.

544
00:34:33,217 --> 00:34:39,822
[SPEAKER_21]: I watched the worst episode of Transformers in history next to Carnage in C minor or major, whatever it was.

545
00:34:39,842 --> 00:34:40,363
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

546
00:34:40,543 --> 00:34:44,065
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the Starscream's Ghost episode for season three and it's the worst episode ever.

547
00:34:44,506 --> 00:34:46,808
[SPEAKER_08]: You said everything from your youth is making a comeback, right?

548
00:34:46,828 --> 00:34:50,670
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because they say like things cycle in 20 year cycles.

549
00:34:50,771 --> 00:34:53,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Like in the 80s, 60s things were popular again.

550
00:34:53,393 --> 00:34:58,797
[SPEAKER_08]: And here we are in the year 2000s and the 80s stuff is making a comeback because it's 20 years ago.

551
00:34:58,837 --> 00:35:00,298
[SPEAKER_08]: So like all the stuff from our childhood is making a comeback.

552
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:02,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Just think, in 20 years, DDR is going to make a comeback.

553
00:35:08,061 --> 00:35:11,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember that retro geeky dancing game we all used to play?

554
00:35:12,303 --> 00:35:13,244
[SPEAKER_21]: Technically, didn't we?

555
00:35:15,345 --> 00:35:16,266
[SPEAKER_21]: Dance Aerobics!

556
00:35:18,547 --> 00:35:20,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, that Dance Aerobics game was the shit.

557
00:35:20,948 --> 00:35:21,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry to interrupt.

558
00:35:21,549 --> 00:35:24,370
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, now we're getting what, um, Aerobics Revolution?

559
00:35:26,231 --> 00:35:26,992
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that in Japan now?

560
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:28,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I think so, yeah.

561
00:35:30,614 --> 00:35:31,414
[SPEAKER_21]: I have spirits.

562
00:35:34,516 --> 00:35:35,356
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it got quiet.

563
00:35:35,656 --> 00:35:36,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, are you done with your story?

564
00:35:37,864 --> 00:35:38,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I was telling a story.

565
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:40,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.

566
00:35:41,327 --> 00:35:42,468
[SPEAKER_21]: I got sidetracked, sorry.

567
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,050
[SPEAKER_08]: It's alright.

568
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:47,292
[SPEAKER_21]: That happens all the time.

569
00:35:47,332 --> 00:35:48,073
[SPEAKER_21]: So whose turn is it?

570
00:35:48,693 --> 00:35:49,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, Loki's.

571
00:35:49,574 --> 00:35:50,595
[SPEAKER_21]: Here you go, Bacon Breath.

572
00:35:52,857 --> 00:35:53,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, how was your week?

573
00:35:53,597 --> 00:35:54,058
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your day?

574
00:35:54,258 --> 00:35:55,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Almost Bacon Breath.

575
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:57,861
Bacon Breath.

576
00:35:58,221 --> 00:35:59,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Bacon Breath.

577
00:35:59,702 --> 00:36:01,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, my week was good.

578
00:36:01,503 --> 00:36:03,405
[SPEAKER_07]: I finished both DDR pads.

579
00:36:03,445 --> 00:36:04,506
[SPEAKER_07]: They're done, thank God.

580
00:36:05,126 --> 00:36:07,008
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so glad to be done with those.

581
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,301
[SPEAKER_09]: and so I finished those.

582
00:36:11,341 --> 00:36:15,422
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to kind of actually, they were finished last night, very late.

583
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:26,546
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to do a really ghetto job on one of the panels because I lost one of the corner pieces somehow and so there's a nice little square metal piece holding one of the panels and I see it.

584
00:36:27,707 --> 00:36:29,447
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a square mending bracket.

585
00:36:30,007 --> 00:36:36,850
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyways, I started this morning or afternoon, I started my cabinet so...

586
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:49,714
[SPEAKER_07]: by estimates it shouldn't take too long to do, probably about a week or two and it'll be done because I'm already, you know, almost finished drawing up the first, um, the first, what the hell?

587
00:36:53,015 --> 00:36:53,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

588
00:36:56,596 --> 00:36:56,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

589
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:04,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, um, yeah, I'm almost done drawing up the first, um, whole sheet of, um,

590
00:37:05,595 --> 00:37:07,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, don't be knocking it, you know you'll enjoy it.

591
00:37:07,496 --> 00:37:12,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking being able to break out the old school games and stuff.

592
00:37:30,495 --> 00:37:40,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, then yesterday we went down to Golf Land and played a bunch of F-Zero because there's no one playing it and there was a bunch of other people playing DDR and some retard unplugged the machine while we were trying to play it.

593
00:37:41,037 --> 00:37:41,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuckers.

594
00:37:44,698 --> 00:37:45,078
[SPEAKER_07]: What else?

595
00:37:45,298 --> 00:37:46,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, not too much.

596
00:37:47,659 --> 00:37:49,219
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear Drum Mania is broken again.

597
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it was.

598
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,061
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in police call attendant mode, so as soon as Keith gets back there on Monday, I'll be fine again.

599
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:55,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

600
00:37:57,509 --> 00:37:58,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Then what else?

601
00:37:58,269 --> 00:38:02,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, during the week sucked and didn't do a whole lot other than see Kill Bill.

602
00:38:02,892 --> 00:38:03,413
[SPEAKER_07]: That was cool.

603
00:38:04,593 --> 00:38:05,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's it.

604
00:38:05,594 --> 00:38:06,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Not too much.

605
00:38:10,237 --> 00:38:14,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let's talk to, um, let's talk to Andrew.

606
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Andrew, how was your week?

607
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:16,821
[SPEAKER_08]: How was your day?

608
00:38:19,402 --> 00:38:20,703
[SPEAKER_12]: Week, exhausting.

609
00:38:21,023 --> 00:38:22,164
[SPEAKER_12]: Day, to suck.

610
00:38:23,665 --> 00:38:23,805
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh...

611
00:38:24,727 --> 00:38:29,510
[SPEAKER_12]: Just day after day after day of college, which is absolutely tiring.

612
00:38:31,491 --> 00:38:35,453
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll get to that a little bit in the FUs.

613
00:38:36,194 --> 00:38:38,735
[SPEAKER_12]: Today I just sat around, played Ragnarok.

614
00:38:39,175 --> 00:38:45,579
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually leveled a couple of times, which is getting harder and harder, but figured it all balances out.

615
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,000
[SPEAKER_11]: That's about it.

616
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,001
[SPEAKER_11]: At least got bored and decided to come here.

617
00:38:57,421 --> 00:39:02,644
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I've actually considered getting back into Ragnarok lately, but I decided to start Final Fantasy X again.

618
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:04,925
[SPEAKER_12]: No, Ragnarok.

619
00:39:06,366 --> 00:39:08,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Not until I finish Final Fantasy X. I'll tank your Acolyte.

620
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:10,007
[SPEAKER_12]: Play Ragnarok.

621
00:39:10,528 --> 00:39:15,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, are you on Loki server?

622
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,551
[SPEAKER_12]: I play on all three servers.

623
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:27,036
[SPEAKER_21]: You have to play on Chaos so I can take you out with my assassin and gain you like, what, 20 levels in an hour?

624
00:39:28,334 --> 00:39:28,834
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do that.

625
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:38,556
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not until I finish Final Fantasy X. Because I started Final Fantasy X some time ago, like about a year and a half.

626
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:39,457
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it was about a year ago.

627
00:39:40,037 --> 00:39:41,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it was when I was with my ex.

628
00:39:41,517 --> 00:39:42,257
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a year ago.

629
00:39:42,737 --> 00:39:44,498
[SPEAKER_08]: And I started it and I never finished it.

630
00:39:44,918 --> 00:39:46,138
[SPEAKER_08]: I only got about ten hours into it.

631
00:39:46,238 --> 00:39:48,619
[SPEAKER_08]: And so last week after the show, I picked it up again.

632
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:49,819
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, I'm bored.

633
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:50,619
[SPEAKER_08]: I need something to do.

634
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:53,800
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm like, okay, I'm going to play Final Fantasy X. I'm going to play it.

635
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,380
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to beat it.

636
00:39:54,827 --> 00:39:56,248
[SPEAKER_21]: I need to restart the international one.

637
00:39:56,488 --> 00:39:59,870
[SPEAKER_08]: And in this one week, I'm already past where I was last time.

638
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,271
[SPEAKER_08]: I just got past that point today.

639
00:40:03,912 --> 00:40:05,172
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to know what's going to be scary?

640
00:40:05,292 --> 00:40:06,673
[SPEAKER_21]: The international version is easier.

641
00:40:07,894 --> 00:40:11,095
[SPEAKER_21]: So if I get started playing, I'll catch up to you.

642
00:40:13,616 --> 00:40:15,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I know Final Fantasy X is so 2002.

643
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:15,697
[SPEAKER_08]: So what?

644
00:40:17,276 --> 00:40:18,097
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a late bloomer.

645
00:40:18,117 --> 00:40:18,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob's retro.

646
00:40:18,777 --> 00:40:19,498
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm retro.

647
00:40:20,278 --> 00:40:20,919
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

648
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:28,864
[SPEAKER_08]: With Final Fantasy X-2 coming out pretty soon, you know, it means the story will be fresh in my mind.

649
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:36,109
[SPEAKER_21]: If anyone has ever been to the GameStop in Arden Fair Mall, that was my DVD in the machine there.

650
00:40:36,129 --> 00:40:40,312
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember that crappy DVD that I picked up last time you were here, when Maren was here?

651
00:40:41,474 --> 00:40:45,515
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the DVD that's been selling all the pre-orders at Arden Fair Mall.

652
00:40:45,695 --> 00:40:46,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's cool.

653
00:40:46,435 --> 00:40:47,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever works.

654
00:40:47,455 --> 00:40:51,816
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so my DVD, my piece of shit DVD went to a good use.

655
00:40:52,556 --> 00:40:52,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Good deal.

656
00:40:54,276 --> 00:40:55,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear from Bradley.

657
00:40:55,396 --> 00:40:55,877
[SPEAKER_08]: How was your day?

658
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:56,417
[SPEAKER_08]: How was your week?

659
00:40:58,477 --> 00:41:02,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, most of my week was spent looking for jobs type things.

660
00:41:03,598 --> 00:41:07,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Like working on my cover letter and trying a few things.

661
00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:09,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Waiting for the... What was the...

662
00:41:12,716 --> 00:41:20,500
[SPEAKER_06]: What the final word on that job I interviewed last week for and finally they got back to me and said I didn't get it on Thursday.

663
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:39,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, on that same day I got a one day job for Friday where I just went in and on Friday I went up and typed in a bunch of names and addresses and phone and fax numbers for a mailing list type thing for a sort of testing software, basically like

664
00:41:40,262 --> 00:41:44,906
[SPEAKER_06]: One of those Excel access, all those type testing programs.

665
00:41:47,248 --> 00:41:49,569
[SPEAKER_06]: That could have been their list.

666
00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:50,750
[SPEAKER_06]: They might have just told me wrong.

667
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:57,836
[SPEAKER_06]: And I listened to a woman in there talking about the Governator over and over again to various people on the phone.

668
00:42:00,678 --> 00:42:01,879
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear grumbling in the background.

669
00:42:02,459 --> 00:42:03,400
[SPEAKER_21]: It's over.

670
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,442
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's not talk about it anymore.

671
00:42:05,462 --> 00:42:08,304
[SPEAKER_21]: This isn't even real Bako's.

672
00:42:09,076 --> 00:42:09,817
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they're Fakos.

673
00:42:09,837 --> 00:42:15,821
[SPEAKER_21]: They're bacon-flavored chips brand bacon things with no MSG.

674
00:42:16,321 --> 00:42:18,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they are.

675
00:42:18,443 --> 00:42:18,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

676
00:42:18,923 --> 00:42:19,583
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

677
00:42:19,664 --> 00:42:21,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have commented on them.

678
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:22,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

679
00:42:22,145 --> 00:42:24,047
[SPEAKER_21]: It's my job to make the random side comments.

680
00:42:26,789 --> 00:42:31,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Spent time putting stuff on eBay because I need to get money fast before I run out.

681
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:34,174
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see.

682
00:42:34,234 --> 00:42:37,796
[SPEAKER_06]: On Saturday, I got invited out to go see Kill Bill via...

683
00:42:41,054 --> 00:42:42,835
[SPEAKER_06]: One person people know, Neil.

684
00:42:44,036 --> 00:42:45,997
[SPEAKER_06]: He invited me out and said that he'd pay for it.

685
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:50,379
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I drove all the way out to Fairfield so that cost about the same amount as a ticket.

686
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,421
[SPEAKER_06]: But I actually had gas.

687
00:42:53,441 --> 00:42:57,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have the kind of money to actually pay for that.

688
00:42:57,203 --> 00:42:58,263
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in my wallet at the time.

689
00:42:59,004 --> 00:43:05,467
[SPEAKER_06]: So we sold that and ate at the only Chick-fil-A in Northern California.

690
00:43:05,967 --> 00:43:06,968
[SPEAKER_21]: Chick-fil-A is awesome.

691
00:43:09,539 --> 00:43:10,560
[SPEAKER_21]: And they're closed on Sundays.

692
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I haven't eaten there for like a year and a half.

693
00:43:14,322 --> 00:43:18,365
[SPEAKER_21]: Chick-fil-A is the best chicken fast food chain ever.

694
00:43:19,146 --> 00:43:25,450
[SPEAKER_21]: You can only get Chick-fil-A, no, I take that back, because there's a Chick-fil-A restaurant in Mobile, but usually the only places I've ever seen them are in malls.

695
00:43:26,411 --> 00:43:31,094
[SPEAKER_21]: And apparently the owner of the company is, you know, super Christian, and they're always closed on Sunday.

696
00:43:32,035 --> 00:43:32,835
[SPEAKER_21]: But they have the best chicken.

697
00:43:33,616 --> 00:43:34,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, their chicken is very good.

698
00:43:34,997 --> 00:43:35,957
[SPEAKER_21]: And Polynesian sauce.

699
00:43:36,278 --> 00:43:36,418
[SPEAKER_21]: Mm-hmm.

700
00:43:43,324 --> 00:43:45,365
[SPEAKER_21]: No one can hear what you're saying.

701
00:43:45,946 --> 00:43:47,127
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good thing.

702
00:43:47,827 --> 00:43:48,528
[SPEAKER_21]: Continue, please.

703
00:43:48,948 --> 00:43:57,875
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, and today, just put more stuff up on eBay.

704
00:43:59,216 --> 00:44:04,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need to figure out any other plan of action for looking for jobs really fast.

705
00:44:05,621 --> 00:44:08,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food.

706
00:44:09,096 --> 00:44:09,997
[SPEAKER_06]: basically, that's all.

707
00:44:12,438 --> 00:44:13,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Now everyone's asleep.

708
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:14,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Wake up, wake up!

709
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:22,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'll take over then because I haven't talked about my week and my day and I know everybody wants to hear about my week and my day.

710
00:44:23,845 --> 00:44:26,387
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually did pay some money this week on Friday.

711
00:44:26,447 --> 00:44:36,333
[SPEAKER_06]: I had some tokens left so I went by Roseville Golf Land and played two games of two games of Tar Freaks and one game of DDR but then I failed on

712
00:44:37,234 --> 00:44:41,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Twilight Zone, because I forgot to turn off the shuffle.

713
00:44:41,878 --> 00:44:43,119
[SPEAKER_06]: It just failed right at the end.

714
00:44:45,241 --> 00:44:46,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now you go.

715
00:44:47,764 --> 00:44:48,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, my week and my day.

716
00:44:50,126 --> 00:44:53,589
[SPEAKER_08]: For my week, I didn't do a whole lot of exciting stuff.

717
00:44:53,629 --> 00:44:56,912
[SPEAKER_08]: I played a lot of Final Fantasy X, and I did a lot of napping.

718
00:44:57,732 --> 00:45:00,895
[SPEAKER_08]: And Vanilla Sky on Monday was great, of course.

719
00:45:01,796 --> 00:45:03,758
[SPEAKER_08]: And let's see...

720
00:45:04,887 --> 00:45:12,072
[SPEAKER_08]: I went out to Golfland on Thursday and I played some DDR and some S0 and I also did last night, Saturday night.

721
00:45:13,393 --> 00:45:19,797
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't really like going to Golfland on the weekends because I run into too many people that are in line and stuff.

722
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:24,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that I... I mean, I like seeing some of the people in the DDR community that I don't get to see very often.

723
00:45:24,761 --> 00:45:27,563
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that was cool because I saw one guy I don't get to see very often.

724
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:31,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to tell it during the FUs.

725
00:45:31,705 --> 00:45:31,986
[SPEAKER_08]: And then...

726
00:45:33,052 --> 00:45:36,575
[SPEAKER_08]: I see some good faces and that's cool.

727
00:45:36,595 --> 00:45:40,717
[SPEAKER_08]: But then there's just a lot of those people to get in the way.

728
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:44,960
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't like that on Saturday.

729
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:54,146
[SPEAKER_08]: And all the guy and their girlfriend that are trying to play DDR for the first time because it's cute and stuff like that.

730
00:45:54,547 --> 00:45:58,529
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess I should stop being so elitist because that's how we all get into DDR at one point.

731
00:45:58,609 --> 00:46:01,391
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just don't like waiting is what it boils down to.

732
00:46:01,531 --> 00:46:02,172
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know.

733
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:03,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Get out of my way, I want to play.

734
00:46:05,421 --> 00:46:09,103
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why Thursdays are always better for DDR.

735
00:46:09,203 --> 00:46:15,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Friday night was supposed to be this great night where we were going to go see the movie and we were going to go out dancing and we were going to get our slut on.

736
00:46:15,628 --> 00:46:16,528
[SPEAKER_08]: But it didn't happen.

737
00:46:16,568 --> 00:46:18,730
[SPEAKER_08]: We just went to the movie and then went to eat and then we went home.

738
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,692
[SPEAKER_08]: We ended up going out because we were all lazy.

739
00:46:22,052 --> 00:46:25,174
[SPEAKER_08]: And my friend at work is going to kill me because we were supposed to meet her out Saturday night.

740
00:46:27,175 --> 00:46:28,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Billy was supposed to come back last night.

741
00:46:28,856 --> 00:46:31,378
[SPEAKER_08]: My sister Billy was supposed to be here.

742
00:46:32,728 --> 00:46:36,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, my sister, Billy, was supposed to be here yesterday, but he didn't come back.

743
00:46:36,889 --> 00:46:42,892
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think a sheep ate him, because he lives in Chico, and all they have up there is sheep.

744
00:46:45,132 --> 00:46:53,155
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was pretty much my day of my week, because I did napping, Final Fantasy X, some DDR, some F-Zero, and Kill Bill.

745
00:46:53,675 --> 00:46:54,456
[SPEAKER_08]: That was pretty much it.

746
00:46:57,037 --> 00:47:00,818
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jamie's destroying the kitchen, so I think now's a good time for us to take a break.

747
00:47:01,974 --> 00:47:05,976
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take a break, and we're going to come back, and I don't know, what do you guys want to do when we come back?

748
00:47:05,996 --> 00:47:08,877
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to do a cage match, FU's of the week, you want to talk about more stuff?

749
00:47:08,937 --> 00:47:09,197
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

750
00:47:09,977 --> 00:47:10,257
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

751
00:47:10,877 --> 00:47:23,482
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do the FU's of the week when we come back, so if you want to send your FU's of the week to me, Sky, in the chat room, and to get into our chat room, go to www.callyvamani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat.

752
00:47:24,903 --> 00:47:28,904
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, we're going to play in this break, I think we're going to do something a little bit longer in this break.

753
00:47:29,705 --> 00:47:30,485
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do

754
00:47:31,621 --> 00:47:33,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's longer and harder.

755
00:47:34,002 --> 00:47:39,545
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we're going to do the 80s Do It Right, the electro-extended mix.

756
00:47:39,705 --> 00:47:40,986
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do the long version of that.

757
00:47:41,006 --> 00:47:43,247
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about five minutes long, but it's a good break song.

758
00:47:43,287 --> 00:47:45,468
[SPEAKER_08]: So after this, we'll be back with the FUs of the Week.

759
00:47:50,314 --> 00:47:51,255
Thanks for watching!

760
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:17,964
DarkSakura

761
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,586
What you wanna do?

762
00:49:30,606 --> 00:49:31,610
Get into the groove

763
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:35,093
Thank you for watching!

764
00:50:57,369 --> 00:50:57,789
Thank you.

765
00:51:38,101 --> 00:51:38,702
Thank you for watching.

766
00:52:16,736 --> 00:52:16,937
Thank you.

767
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:18,125
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

768
00:53:19,266 --> 00:53:19,906
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

769
00:53:22,909 --> 00:53:24,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we care what people think of us?

770
00:53:24,891 --> 00:53:26,652
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

771
00:53:26,752 --> 00:53:28,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

772
00:53:28,714 --> 00:53:29,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

773
00:53:30,456 --> 00:53:30,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes!

774
00:53:32,802 --> 00:53:34,684
[SPEAKER_18]: Extreme Bobani Radio.

775
00:53:34,864 --> 00:53:38,648
[SPEAKER_18]: That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

776
00:53:41,711 --> 00:53:42,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, we're back.

777
00:53:43,573 --> 00:53:51,480
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm eating, sorry, and I'm drinking shitty beer that Jamie's making me drink because she's a bad after-school special bully.

778
00:53:52,261 --> 00:53:53,923
See?

779
00:53:53,983 --> 00:53:54,203
[SPEAKER_08]: See?

780
00:53:59,176 --> 00:54:02,378
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Triscuits Reduce Fat and Wheat Thins Reduce Fat, that's okay.

781
00:54:02,478 --> 00:54:05,779
[SPEAKER_08]: It's those goddamn cookies where they like just totally don't even taste right.

782
00:54:14,643 --> 00:54:16,704
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like eating reduced fat ice cream.

783
00:54:16,744 --> 00:54:17,405
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the point?

784
00:54:20,526 --> 00:54:22,627
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's ice, you know, ice cream's good.

785
00:54:22,667 --> 00:54:24,288
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're going to eat ice cream, you know what?

786
00:54:34,298 --> 00:54:39,259
[SPEAKER_08]: The only beer that Orange Lounge Radio endorses would be Guinness, by the way, if you're curious.

787
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:41,680
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say the only beer that we endorse is Guinness.

788
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,180
[SPEAKER_08]: And why do we like Guinness so much, Jamie?

789
00:54:53,602 --> 00:54:53,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

790
00:54:57,203 --> 00:54:57,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

791
00:55:01,964 --> 00:55:03,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you ready to do the F.E.s of the week, Jamie?

792
00:55:05,407 --> 00:55:06,307
This is fucked up!

793
00:55:06,327 --> 00:55:07,048
This is fucked up!

794
00:55:40,297 --> 00:55:41,227
[SPEAKER_23]: This is fucked up!

795
00:56:24,578 --> 00:56:30,681
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it wasn't.

796
00:56:30,941 --> 00:56:32,502
[SPEAKER_21]: Everyone just missed everything I said, didn't they?

797
00:56:32,662 --> 00:56:34,664
[SPEAKER_21]: I was just going to say... I can start all over!

798
00:56:35,084 --> 00:56:35,284
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

799
00:56:35,344 --> 00:56:38,025
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you want me to start the music over?

800
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:38,326
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

801
00:56:38,786 --> 00:56:45,790
[SPEAKER_21]: I said fucking people at Walmart for not taking responsibility for your cart, when you pull out your cart, you need to put it back up.

802
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:48,091
[SPEAKER_21]: It's really inconsiderate to leave it in people's way.

803
00:56:49,381 --> 00:56:52,744
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, and then I said about parents, fuck all of them, well, most of them.

804
00:56:54,065 --> 00:57:04,553
[SPEAKER_21]: Especially if you decide that, you know, oh, I want to have a kid, and then you don't put any thought into the responsibilities involved with, you know, having the kid.

805
00:57:05,454 --> 00:57:07,576
[SPEAKER_21]: You need to take responsibility for yourself.

806
00:57:08,016 --> 00:57:12,059
[SPEAKER_21]: And then, oh my god, the people who blame everybody else for problems that they cause.

807
00:57:13,421 --> 00:57:18,845
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, you need to, people need to learn how to take responsibility for themselves, for their own actions.

808
00:57:19,827 --> 00:57:23,348
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, you can't believe everything that you see on TV.

809
00:57:23,788 --> 00:57:25,248
[SPEAKER_21]: You can't believe everything that you read.

810
00:57:25,268 --> 00:57:26,948
[SPEAKER_21]: You need to learn how to think for yourself.

811
00:57:27,008 --> 00:57:29,269
[SPEAKER_21]: And so, fuck everybody.

812
00:57:29,369 --> 00:57:30,749
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I'm really tired of people.

813
00:57:31,569 --> 00:57:32,430
[SPEAKER_21]: Not everybody.

814
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:34,750
[SPEAKER_21]: Everybody in this room is in the cool book, except Andrew.

815
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:40,171
[SPEAKER_21]: You're in the lukewarm book.

816
00:57:40,591 --> 00:57:44,532
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck Corona, because it sucks, but it's not as bad as that pale ale that I'm making Rob drink.

817
00:57:46,492 --> 00:57:46,652
[SPEAKER_21]: And...

818
00:57:50,732 --> 00:57:53,794
[SPEAKER_21]: Really, I can't think of anything else.

819
00:57:54,634 --> 00:57:57,976
[SPEAKER_21]: What else was I going off about today, Rob?

820
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:59,797
[SPEAKER_21]: When I was going off in the parking lot at Walmart?

821
00:58:00,957 --> 00:58:04,859
[SPEAKER_21]: I swear my best step is when I'm not on the show.

822
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:06,320
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember.

823
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,321
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck mages in Ragnarok.

824
00:58:09,141 --> 00:58:10,202
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm a mage.

825
00:58:10,242 --> 00:58:10,702
[SPEAKER_21]: Fight me.

826
00:58:10,742 --> 00:58:11,983
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck you.

827
00:58:12,223 --> 00:58:14,884
[SPEAKER_21]: For kill stealing.

828
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,145
[SPEAKER_21]: And then fuck glass time.

829
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:20,127
[SPEAKER_21]: For not bringing me the things to kill fast enough.

830
00:58:21,021 --> 00:58:25,003
[SPEAKER_21]: So that I can level faster because I have an archer and I can snipe off the wall.

831
00:58:26,604 --> 00:58:35,229
[SPEAKER_21]: And then... Fuck me for buying stupid things that nobody wants to buy because I was up to 800,000 zeny.

832
00:58:35,909 --> 00:58:38,250
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I bought a bunch of stuff and then no one's buying it.

833
00:58:38,971 --> 00:58:39,871
[SPEAKER_21]: I made poison belts.

834
00:58:40,091 --> 00:58:43,593
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm selling them for four times what they're worth.

835
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:44,454
[SPEAKER_21]: But that's about it.

836
00:58:47,142 --> 00:58:50,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we're gonna go to Loki, who has to explain his new music.

837
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:52,746
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in theme with the show.

838
00:58:55,528 --> 00:58:55,968
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.

839
00:58:56,629 --> 00:58:56,969
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes.

840
00:58:56,989 --> 00:59:03,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I have some choking here.

841
00:59:04,755 --> 00:59:05,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

842
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:10,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, first FU of the week is gonna go to, um, Stupid Drivers.

843
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, more particularly, um, old people.

844
00:59:14,862 --> 00:59:16,463
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like you and you drive too slow.

845
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:21,173
[SPEAKER_08]: And cutting in front of me and then driving slow really pisses me off.

846
00:59:22,414 --> 00:59:27,337
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're lucky that, um, I don't have a gun because I would probably do a drive-by as I'm passing you.

847
00:59:28,057 --> 00:59:30,519
[SPEAKER_09]: But, um, since I don't, I can't do that.

848
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:33,241
[SPEAKER_09]: All I can do is just get angry and give you glaring looks.

849
00:59:34,882 --> 00:59:45,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, um, also, FU2, or, um, fucking neighbors, okay, can't park their truck worth of shit.

850
00:59:45,769 --> 00:59:46,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, yesterday...

851
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:56,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Yesterday, I tried to pull out of our space, and the guys over the line, like, I practically had, like, to squeeze through to get in there.

852
00:59:57,907 --> 01:00:00,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, they're getting high out in front of their house.

853
01:00:02,689 --> 01:00:07,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, lucky as stupid people at Golfland, there's some kids that, like,

854
01:00:08,041 --> 01:00:13,424
[SPEAKER_07]: went and jumped up on the pad and started tapping dumb buttons really hard while I was selecting a song and then left.

855
01:00:13,644 --> 01:00:15,565
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't even give a shit at all.

856
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:19,267
[SPEAKER_07]: I just didn't even look at him, didn't even get angry, pretended it never happened.

857
01:00:19,767 --> 01:00:21,188
[SPEAKER_07]: That pissed him off and that was funny.

858
01:00:21,748 --> 01:00:27,752
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, um, fuck you too, uh... Oh shit, I don't know.

859
01:00:28,032 --> 01:00:31,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, the fact that I don't have any food in the fridge because I ate it all.

860
01:00:32,954 --> 01:00:34,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, I don't want the cracker.

861
01:00:35,609 --> 01:00:39,750
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm eating, uh, potatoes that are kind of going bad, if potatoes can go bad.

862
01:00:40,711 --> 01:00:45,232
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, uh, and then, um, let's see what else.

863
01:00:47,513 --> 01:00:49,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I don't know, I don't really have too much.

864
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:54,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you, those stupid DDR pads over at the, uh, theater because they were slippery as hell.

865
01:00:55,876 --> 01:00:58,657
[SPEAKER_08]: I nearly killed myself on those just plain normal songs.

866
01:00:59,037 --> 01:00:59,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Not anything hard.

867
01:00:59,897 --> 01:01:04,139
[SPEAKER_07]: If I played anything hard, probably blood all over the pads, which would have been sweet.

868
01:01:04,539 --> 01:01:04,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

869
01:01:06,628 --> 01:01:15,271
[SPEAKER_07]: and then finally, um, just, uh, FU Yahoo News because you report on this really dumbest shit.

870
01:01:15,831 --> 01:01:24,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, also an FU to British scientists because, um, don't you have anything better to do than to, uh, test to see if a cookie crumbles and shit like that?

871
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:26,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Stupid Brits.

872
01:01:26,755 --> 01:01:27,375
[SPEAKER_07]: They're so dumb.

873
01:01:28,916 --> 01:01:29,996
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it's all about budgeting.

874
01:01:30,036 --> 01:01:35,278
[SPEAKER_21]: See, they start running out of money for funding, so they have to do stupid experiments so that they can keep their budget.

875
01:01:36,661 --> 01:01:39,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, actually, finally, fuck you to the RIAA.

876
01:01:40,244 --> 01:01:40,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again.

877
01:01:41,145 --> 01:01:48,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, more, not really the RIAA, but mainly, um, well, anyways, let me, uh, just give a backstory to this.

878
01:01:48,752 --> 01:01:56,159
[SPEAKER_08]: About a week or two ago, there was, um, an announcement of this new copy protection for this CD, or whatever.

879
01:01:56,619 --> 01:01:58,781
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some loser band put out.

880
01:01:59,722 --> 01:02:00,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably country.

881
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:02,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, and, um...

882
01:02:03,209 --> 01:02:08,672
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it got put out, and then people found out they can get past the copy protection by holding down the shift key.

883
01:02:09,933 --> 01:02:11,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that was pretty dumb of them, now wasn't it?

884
01:02:12,514 --> 01:02:28,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, so, you know, a few weeks later, this kid, um, in college, writes on his webpage, basically a kind of like a little, uh, essay or, you know, term paper type thing about, you know, copy protection, and he mentioned on that how you can bypass that.

885
01:02:28,422 --> 01:02:31,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the company didn't like that, that they posted that on his site, so...

886
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:34,350
[SPEAKER_08]: They're suing him.

887
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:46,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, Yahoo reports this, reports a story saying directly in that article that this CD can be bypassed by holding shift.

888
01:02:47,893 --> 01:03:00,316
[SPEAKER_08]: So, they're suing him for his term paper that got viewed by a couple hundred people, maybe, whereas Yahoo News gets viewed by millions and millions and millions of people.

889
01:03:01,357 --> 01:03:02,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that a bit ironic?

890
01:03:04,229 --> 01:03:05,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's it.

891
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:05,970
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done.

892
01:03:09,392 --> 01:03:10,533
[SPEAKER_08]: I have an FU of the week.

893
01:03:11,193 --> 01:03:19,598
[SPEAKER_08]: I was at Golfland yesterday, and there was this really cool girl there, and I have no idea who she is, but she wore a shirt that said this shirt was tested on animals.

894
01:03:20,233 --> 01:03:20,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Something like that.

895
01:03:20,833 --> 01:03:21,613
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought she was cool.

896
01:03:21,974 --> 01:03:23,014
[SPEAKER_08]: She's really good at DDR.

897
01:03:23,054 --> 01:03:25,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, she passed Dropout, which, you know, that's pretty good.

898
01:03:27,656 --> 01:03:36,518
[SPEAKER_08]: So, she was playing, and these asshole drunk people got up next to her and started playing, like, you know, without putting the money in.

899
01:03:36,538 --> 01:03:38,839
[SPEAKER_08]: They were dancing on the pad, like, mocking her and stuff like that.

900
01:03:38,859 --> 01:03:40,120
[SPEAKER_08]: And I fucking hate those people.

901
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,340
[SPEAKER_08]: So, F you to those people.

902
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:44,121
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was really great because... You didn't have them burn out?

903
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:45,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't find them.

904
01:03:45,702 --> 01:03:49,803
[SPEAKER_08]: I was in the middle of my game, and by the time I was done, they were kind of... Well, this is what happened.

905
01:03:50,985 --> 01:03:57,008
[SPEAKER_08]: is that they got up, as soon as I got off Extreme, they went up on Extreme to start playing.

906
01:03:57,409 --> 01:04:06,233
[SPEAKER_08]: And she finished her game right as they put the money in the machine, so she kind of watched them for a minute, and then as soon as they went to select a song, the drunk guy was like, and he's trying to pick a song, right?

907
01:04:06,613 --> 01:04:10,576
[SPEAKER_08]: And she just walked up, hit the down arrow several times, and then walked out the door.

908
01:04:10,956 --> 01:04:12,297
[SPEAKER_08]: It decreased the difficulty.

909
01:04:12,357 --> 01:04:12,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

910
01:04:13,917 --> 01:04:16,119
[SPEAKER_08]: So, they failed, by the way, if you're listening.

911
01:04:17,059 --> 01:04:18,680
[SPEAKER_21]: I just would have had them done out.

912
01:04:19,486 --> 01:04:23,567
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I, Keith wasn't there, and I don't like any of the other employees, really.

913
01:04:24,588 --> 01:04:25,348
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know any of them.

914
01:04:26,328 --> 01:04:30,429
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what, I wonder if my trackers would be perfect to go with that single time.

915
01:04:30,489 --> 01:04:31,630
[SPEAKER_08]: What, getting people thrown out?

916
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:32,790
[SPEAKER_21]: I get someone thrown out every time.

917
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:37,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Not if you go Tuesday or Thursday, there's probably ever people there on Tuesday or Thursday, but, like, Saturday, yeah, you could.

918
01:04:37,472 --> 01:04:39,352
[SPEAKER_08]: You could have gotten those people thrown out.

919
01:04:39,372 --> 01:04:40,452
[SPEAKER_21]: That used to be my hobby.

920
01:04:44,454 --> 01:04:48,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, that's pretty much it, I don't really have, uh, F you'd anything else.

921
01:04:49,276 --> 01:04:56,422
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to the fact that they decided to split Kill Bill into two parts because I'm impatient and I want to see both parts on Friday.

922
01:04:58,064 --> 01:04:59,205
[SPEAKER_08]: You suck, Miramax.

923
01:05:00,666 --> 01:05:03,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's hear from the others assembled here in the room.

924
01:05:03,408 --> 01:05:04,229
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll start with Andrew.

925
01:05:08,573 --> 01:05:09,474
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not chubbed.

926
01:05:10,495 --> 01:05:11,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Just do your F yous.

927
01:05:12,794 --> 01:05:19,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, F you to my Linux teacher deciding to take a sick day two days before the final.

928
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,041
[SPEAKER_08]: It's our study day, goddammit.

929
01:05:21,201 --> 01:05:22,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Why you gotta take a sick day?

930
01:05:22,782 --> 01:05:24,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody fisk him.

931
01:05:24,704 --> 01:05:25,344
[SPEAKER_12]: Make him all better.

932
01:05:26,245 --> 01:05:37,674
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh... F you to... F you to talking about all this, you know, talking about something and just not being able to get your point across.

933
01:05:37,714 --> 01:05:39,676
[SPEAKER_12]: I find it happens to me way too often.

934
01:05:40,216 --> 01:05:42,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Especially when I'm on the show, so...

935
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:44,120
[SPEAKER_12]: That's about it.

936
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:45,841
[SPEAKER_12]: Not too angsty today.

937
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:50,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Then let's hear from Bradley.

938
01:05:52,023 --> 01:06:02,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, uh, fuck you to not finding work so far.

939
01:06:02,368 --> 01:06:04,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't work hard on that.

940
01:06:04,209 --> 01:06:05,510
[SPEAKER_06]: At least I had that job, I think.

941
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:07,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that, at least.

942
01:06:07,271 --> 01:06:09,792
[SPEAKER_06]: So fuck you to me for doing it too fast.

943
01:06:10,302 --> 01:06:16,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I got it done in like 5.5 hours, and they probably would have paid me for the whole day if I had slowed down a bit.

944
01:06:17,448 --> 01:06:18,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Took a while to pass this.

945
01:06:18,508 --> 01:06:19,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Being a lazy ass.

946
01:06:19,389 --> 01:06:21,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Too good at excelling, I guess.

947
01:06:21,391 --> 01:06:23,893
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like thinking of other ways that I could have done it faster.

948
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:24,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

949
01:06:24,393 --> 01:06:24,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, fuck you too...

950
01:06:36,391 --> 01:06:40,554
[SPEAKER_06]: My falling credit rating, because I know it's doing that as we speak.

951
01:06:40,635 --> 01:06:43,977
[SPEAKER_06]: And bad things are coming on the horizon.

952
01:06:44,177 --> 01:06:46,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't move really, really fast.

953
01:06:46,219 --> 01:06:47,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting stuff started paying off.

954
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,562
[SPEAKER_06]: And finding a job, so.

955
01:06:49,602 --> 01:06:58,929
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm talking to the Bank of America, because they changed their credit card billing system.

956
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:02,292
[SPEAKER_06]: So it takes a day to pay instead of the same day.

957
01:07:02,512 --> 01:07:03,993
[SPEAKER_06]: So it fucked me up last month.

958
01:07:05,555 --> 01:07:05,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Ugh.

959
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:16,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I was lucky for taking so- the guy taking so long to finally tell me that I didn't get the job.

960
01:07:16,114 --> 01:07:19,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Made me wait so long to wait for the inevitable.

961
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:19,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I don't know.

962
01:07:19,896 --> 01:07:22,157
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a huge general situation.

963
01:07:22,177 --> 01:07:23,097
[SPEAKER_03]: But I must persevere.

964
01:07:36,525 --> 01:07:38,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I think that's about everything.

965
01:07:40,847 --> 01:07:41,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

966
01:07:43,649 --> 01:07:46,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, then let's hear from our chatroom.

967
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:48,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Our chatroom's not very angsty tonight.

968
01:07:48,671 --> 01:07:50,652
[SPEAKER_08]: I've only got like three FUs so far.

969
01:07:52,173 --> 01:07:56,135
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they just have been having a good week, so go figure.

970
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:57,976
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll start with Baka.

971
01:07:59,416 --> 01:08:01,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Says, my FU of the week is to school.

972
01:08:01,537 --> 01:08:04,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Says, tomorrow is Columbus Day and we don't have it off from school.

973
01:08:04,439 --> 01:08:04,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Says,

974
01:08:04,983 --> 01:08:08,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Since I guess, finally, that our school has decided to be politically correct.

975
01:08:09,026 --> 01:08:14,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Since Columbus never was the first person to discover America, but it was the indigenous Native American peoples.

976
01:08:16,771 --> 01:08:18,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn school, we should still have a day off.

977
01:08:18,873 --> 01:08:20,554
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be a national holiday.

978
01:08:21,075 --> 01:08:22,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking bastard holes.

979
01:08:22,576 --> 01:08:23,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, guess what?

980
01:08:23,857 --> 01:08:27,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Numbnuts, I have to work tomorrow, so you can damn well go to school.

981
01:08:30,621 --> 01:08:31,302
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

982
01:08:31,972 --> 01:08:35,053
[SPEAKER_08]: You should have to go to school during summer too, because I don't get summer off.

983
01:08:40,976 --> 01:08:42,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on.

984
01:08:43,717 --> 01:08:52,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Zodiac Knight says, my fuck you of the week goes to BestBuy.com for fucking up my order, postponing my shipment of Max 2 US for another week.

985
01:08:53,881 --> 01:08:54,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Sue.

986
01:08:54,661 --> 01:08:54,941
Sue.

987
01:09:01,713 --> 01:09:04,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Mintz would like to say a preemptive F.U.

988
01:09:04,075 --> 01:09:05,596
[SPEAKER_08]: to the week coming up.

989
01:09:06,317 --> 01:09:07,458
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be hell for me.

990
01:09:08,999 --> 01:09:09,399
[SPEAKER_08]: F.U.

991
01:09:09,419 --> 01:09:13,843
[SPEAKER_08]: to the Bursar's, I hope I said that right, the Bursar's office at my college.

992
01:09:13,923 --> 01:09:18,026
[SPEAKER_08]: They're charging late fees to me for a balance I paid off three weeks ago.

993
01:09:19,888 --> 01:09:20,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Sue them.

994
01:09:26,773 --> 01:09:28,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Jamie, would you like to repeat that advice?

995
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:36,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care if he's in the kitchen.

996
01:09:37,575 --> 01:09:39,436
[SPEAKER_08]: The show must go on, goddammit.

997
01:10:05,676 --> 01:10:06,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, let's see.

998
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:12,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Step Mania 3.9 Alpha 7 or something.

999
01:10:12,938 --> 01:10:13,778
[SPEAKER_07]: It's out now.

1000
01:10:14,258 --> 01:10:16,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't even keep track because the name's getting too long.

1001
01:10:17,719 --> 01:10:18,239
[SPEAKER_07]: God damn it.

1002
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:22,040
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, um, some improvements have been made there, I think.

1003
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:27,361
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, uh, I know that they brought back Easy to Dancer support, which, yay.

1004
01:10:27,641 --> 01:10:30,442
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, um, what else?

1005
01:10:30,682 --> 01:10:33,763
[SPEAKER_07]: People are ripping stuff for, um, Max 2.

1006
01:10:35,236 --> 01:10:35,756
[SPEAKER_07]: USA.

1007
01:10:36,597 --> 01:10:39,618
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, god damn it, if I did it, I would have been dumb by now.

1008
01:10:39,998 --> 01:10:44,539
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, they're still doing it, and Lawrence from DDRUK is kind of heading up the project.

1009
01:10:45,299 --> 01:10:47,720
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of cool, because he does a really good job on him.

1010
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:48,460
[SPEAKER_08]: What project?

1011
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:50,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is it a project?

1012
01:10:51,001 --> 01:10:55,382
[SPEAKER_08]: If one guy can do it in an hour, what is needing to be a project of it?

1013
01:10:55,402 --> 01:10:56,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they're retarded!

1014
01:10:56,803 --> 01:10:58,223
[SPEAKER_08]: These people are retarded!

1015
01:10:58,563 --> 01:11:03,765
[SPEAKER_08]: They can't fucking just do it, very simple, because it always has to be complicated.

1016
01:11:04,363 --> 01:11:11,047
[SPEAKER_07]: They always have to, like, get six people to do it or ten people to do it, and no one knows what they're doing, so that's why it's complicated.

1017
01:11:11,247 --> 01:11:11,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1018
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:12,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wondering.

1019
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:14,489
[SPEAKER_21]: Why has it always got to be so complicated?

1020
01:11:18,152 --> 01:11:21,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... Why you gotta go make things so complicated?

1021
01:11:21,974 --> 01:11:29,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, other than that, there's going to be also, obviously, now do your extreme stuff to rip, so... And then, uh...

1022
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:35,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, you don't have to pee too much if they're typing on a keyboard.

1023
01:11:40,451 --> 01:11:43,773
[SPEAKER_21]: Pardon me for interrupting your thing, but if you have to pee, just pee.

1024
01:11:44,293 --> 01:11:44,953
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't care.

1025
01:11:45,113 --> 01:11:45,534
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1026
01:11:45,654 --> 01:11:46,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Pee on the floor.

1027
01:11:46,374 --> 01:11:46,954
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be cool.

1028
01:11:49,756 --> 01:11:50,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

1029
01:11:51,976 --> 01:11:58,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, also, another thing I found in my little travels on the boards there, they have someone made a...

1030
01:12:00,541 --> 01:12:07,666
[SPEAKER_07]: As you know, Stepmania has an unlock system, just in case if you were to ever want to do unlocks.

1031
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:15,951
[SPEAKER_07]: So they actually made an editor so you can do unlocks with an editor, which is kind of neat.

1032
01:12:17,172 --> 01:12:17,572
[SPEAKER_07]: What else?

1033
01:12:19,913 --> 01:12:20,454
[SPEAKER_08]: P.S.

1034
01:12:20,754 --> 01:12:21,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Unlocks are stupid.

1035
01:12:22,155 --> 01:12:25,497
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're releasing songs for Stepmania, you know what?

1036
01:12:25,517 --> 01:12:26,377
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not DDR.

1037
01:12:26,417 --> 01:12:27,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't do unlocks.

1038
01:12:27,651 --> 01:12:28,091
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gay.

1039
01:12:28,231 --> 01:12:28,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Kiss my ass.

1040
01:12:29,092 --> 01:12:30,993
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing Unlocked for this goddamn hell.

1041
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:31,473
[SPEAKER_07]: You're gay.

1042
01:12:32,954 --> 01:12:33,854
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you're gay.

1043
01:12:37,336 --> 01:12:37,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1044
01:12:39,437 --> 01:12:39,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, see?

1045
01:12:39,817 --> 01:12:40,457
[SPEAKER_08]: You're right.

1046
01:12:40,477 --> 01:12:40,838
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gay.

1047
01:12:40,918 --> 01:12:41,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1048
01:12:41,518 --> 01:12:41,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1049
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:48,341
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's RodSteel0014.

1050
01:12:48,962 --> 01:12:52,363
[SPEAKER_08]: You only live until you die.

1051
01:12:54,224 --> 01:12:54,805
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the title.

1052
01:12:54,985 --> 01:12:55,565
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a porno.

1053
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:59,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you see that Brad and Irene loaned us the Whore of the Rings 2?

1054
01:12:59,901 --> 01:13:01,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't gotten to watch it.

1055
01:13:01,642 --> 01:13:03,143
[SPEAKER_07]: That's who it was, Brad and Irene.

1056
01:13:03,163 --> 01:13:05,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just thinking, Matt doesn't have porno like that.

1057
01:13:07,746 --> 01:13:10,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Tall Matt for those listening.

1058
01:13:10,408 --> 01:13:11,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Ice Princess.

1059
01:13:11,228 --> 01:13:15,411
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there's really not much going on in the sim world.

1060
01:13:15,911 --> 01:13:20,634
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been going on like four months now since I played Step Mania, yet for some reason I still download songs.

1061
01:13:20,654 --> 01:13:22,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course I have it, I guess.

1062
01:13:23,056 --> 01:13:23,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Sucker.

1063
01:13:26,499 --> 01:13:27,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Bandwith Horror.

1064
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,560
[SPEAKER_07]: You say that now.

1065
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:40,506
[SPEAKER_09]: It would have been a good parody of James Bond if they had just removed a lot of the porn stuff.

1066
01:13:40,546 --> 01:13:41,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it was funny on its own.

1067
01:13:42,247 --> 01:13:44,148
[SPEAKER_07]: But then they have people having sex for no reason.

1068
01:13:44,308 --> 01:13:47,710
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just detracts from it.

1069
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:53,412
[SPEAKER_09]: I also got six copies of Suicide Circle this week.

1070
01:13:53,592 --> 01:13:54,493
[SPEAKER_07]: That was pretty cool.

1071
01:13:58,357 --> 01:13:58,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1072
01:14:00,078 --> 01:14:02,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's it.

1073
01:14:03,118 --> 01:14:04,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing much going on.

1074
01:14:07,099 --> 01:14:09,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, I think we'll take another break then.

1075
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:12,001
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we could talk about the actual news going on.

1076
01:14:12,661 --> 01:14:13,661
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk about it when we come back.

1077
01:14:14,161 --> 01:14:14,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1078
01:14:14,702 --> 01:14:19,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we're going to play, in this break, we're going to play some more stuff from the V-Rare CD.

1079
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:21,784
[SPEAKER_08]: No Eurobeat.

1080
01:14:22,164 --> 01:14:23,224
[SPEAKER_09]: On the CD, so.

1081
01:14:24,195 --> 01:14:27,557
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to play Freedom by B4U.

1082
01:14:28,898 --> 01:14:35,682
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're going to play the original mix of Think You Better D. And then we'll play So In Love Train.

1083
01:14:37,844 --> 01:14:39,225
[SPEAKER_08]: So In Love Train.

1084
01:14:40,606 --> 01:14:41,946
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the soul train.

1085
01:14:42,247 --> 01:14:45,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so we will... The soul in love train.

1086
01:14:46,269 --> 01:14:48,831
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back after this break and we're going to talk about more news.

[SPEAKER_08]: Testing.

[SPEAKER_08]: Testing 1-2.

1099
01:23:27,557 --> 01:23:31,520
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

1100
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:32,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello?

1101
01:23:32,761 --> 01:23:34,242
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand this.

1102
01:23:34,842 --> 01:23:35,623
[SPEAKER_21]: Does this thing work?

1103
01:23:35,643 --> 01:23:37,264
[SPEAKER_21]: This thing reads like stereo instructions.

1104
01:23:37,324 --> 01:23:37,924
[SPEAKER_21]: Is this on?

01:23:37,944 --> 01:23:38,545

[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1107
01:23:42,708 --> 01:23:44,909
[SPEAKER_18]: Broke down ghetto Bomani Radio.

1108
01:23:44,929 --> 01:23:46,070
[SPEAKER_18]: What the f***?

1109
01:23:47,811 --> 01:23:49,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1110
01:23:51,314 --> 01:23:51,894
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it

1111
01:23:52,318 --> 01:23:57,902
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a comment from the chatroom during the break that we're not our usual chirpy selves or perky selves tonight.

1112
01:23:57,922 --> 01:23:59,603
[SPEAKER_08]: We're kind of in a meh sort of mood.

1113
01:23:59,623 --> 01:24:00,764
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't feel perky.

1114
01:24:01,084 --> 01:24:02,705
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we just all need to get laid.

1115
01:24:04,147 --> 01:24:04,787
[SPEAKER_21]: But I did.

1116
01:24:05,447 --> 01:24:10,571
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean... Hi, welcome back.

1117
01:24:10,651 --> 01:24:13,133
[SPEAKER_21]: There's such things as doors that need to be shut.

1118
01:24:15,795 --> 01:24:15,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1119
01:24:19,910 --> 01:24:23,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, okay, so if you got laid, Jamie, what's your excuse?

1120
01:24:25,551 --> 01:24:26,472
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm all tired out.

1121
01:24:26,952 --> 01:24:27,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

1122
01:24:27,612 --> 01:24:28,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you're spent.

1123
01:24:28,512 --> 01:24:29,132
[SPEAKER_08]: I see how it is.

1124
01:24:29,372 --> 01:24:30,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you're spent.

1125
01:24:30,773 --> 01:24:31,513
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, me.

1126
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:33,453
[SPEAKER_21]: You know.

1127
01:24:33,473 --> 01:24:35,614
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

1128
01:24:35,874 --> 01:24:37,334
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're all just spent then.

1129
01:24:37,834 --> 01:24:38,215
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1130
01:24:39,435 --> 01:24:39,735
[SPEAKER_08]: I see.

1131
01:24:41,127 --> 01:24:42,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know what to tell you.

1132
01:24:42,208 --> 01:24:43,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're all in a weird mood.

1133
01:24:43,548 --> 01:24:45,149
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's just the weather or something.

1134
01:24:45,529 --> 01:24:46,349
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what it is.

1135
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:49,831
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm plenty happy and perky.

1136
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:55,273
[SPEAKER_08]: The rest of you are being... Are you saying we're bringing this show down?

1137
01:24:55,293 --> 01:24:56,794
[SPEAKER_21]: You're bringing me down, man.

1138
01:24:58,735 --> 01:25:00,596
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to kiss my ass, woman.

1139
01:25:01,736 --> 01:25:02,537
[SPEAKER_21]: Not my job.

1140
01:25:02,617 --> 01:25:03,037
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello.

1141
01:25:03,677 --> 01:25:04,818
[SPEAKER_10]: It's nobody's job.

1142
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:06,438
[SPEAKER_10]: It's alright.

1143
01:25:06,699 --> 01:25:07,499
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll get you a puppy.

1144
01:25:10,828 --> 01:25:12,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want... Ew.

1145
01:25:14,111 --> 01:25:14,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew.

1146
01:25:15,272 --> 01:25:15,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Ew.

1147
01:25:19,095 --> 01:25:20,076
[SPEAKER_08]: You're disgusting, Andrew.

1148
01:25:20,096 --> 01:25:21,017
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad nobody can hear that.

1149
01:25:22,498 --> 01:25:25,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you wanted to talk about some actual news going on right now?

1150
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:32,567
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish sometimes we were a TV show so you could have seen that throw.

1151
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:36,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I know what it is.

1152
01:25:36,671 --> 01:25:37,171
[SPEAKER_08]: I know what it is.

1153
01:25:37,672 --> 01:25:37,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1154
01:25:39,030 --> 01:25:40,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Kitty Joe says, you guys are cranky.

1155
01:25:41,352 --> 01:25:44,996
[SPEAKER_08]: And that makes me think, yeah, I think we're just all on our collective period.

1156
01:25:45,336 --> 01:25:46,797
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all on like the same cycle.

1157
01:25:46,937 --> 01:25:49,579
[SPEAKER_08]: So right now, never mind.

1158
01:25:53,843 --> 01:25:56,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Last time I checked, Kitty Joe wasn't a psychiatrist.

1159
01:25:57,887 --> 01:26:00,048
[SPEAKER_09]: So shut the hell up.

1160
01:26:00,068 --> 01:26:02,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, actual news.

1161
01:26:03,977 --> 01:26:08,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, first thing would be DDR Extreme, you know, coming out.

1162
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:09,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, that.

1163
01:26:10,301 --> 01:26:11,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, we forgot about it.

1164
01:26:11,662 --> 01:26:16,205
[SPEAKER_08]: That, you know, that we've been playing the V-Rare songs from and the Consumer Track songs from all night.

1165
01:26:16,545 --> 01:26:16,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1166
01:26:17,326 --> 01:26:21,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, we were kind enough to steal them from Bomani Style because we haven't gotten ours yet.

1167
01:26:22,569 --> 01:26:22,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1168
01:26:24,991 --> 01:26:26,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have PMS.

1169
01:26:30,214 --> 01:26:31,075
[SPEAKER_09]: I do that all the time.

1170
01:26:31,741 --> 01:26:32,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, news.

1171
01:26:34,642 --> 01:26:35,222
[SPEAKER_09]: It came out.

1172
01:26:37,043 --> 01:26:39,884
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't a surprise because we knew it was going to come out for a while now.

1173
01:26:40,104 --> 01:26:46,146
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what's funny about this is that yesterday, the 11th of October, was actually National Coming Out Day.

1174
01:26:46,506 --> 01:26:48,906
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of funny to keep hearing you say, we knew it was going to come out.

1175
01:26:48,967 --> 01:26:50,407
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to come out for a while now.

1176
01:26:50,887 --> 01:26:56,549
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just laughing because I'm thinking of National Coming Out Day and DDR Extreme and how DDR is really gay.

1177
01:26:58,687 --> 01:27:25,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but anyways, yeah, there's some songs on there, um, most notably the, um, songs that we knew were there, and people weren't, you know, saying, no, you're wrong, like Max, period, everyone's like saying, no, that's a dumb name for a song, how could that be coming out, meh, well, guess what, it was in there, and so, hi, laugh at you, and then, um, what else, oh, there was, um, a new, um,

1178
01:27:26,957 --> 01:27:33,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, obviously we found out that the song that everyone liked that we thought was called Overloaded was actually A Stupid Barber, which is a stupid name.

1179
01:27:34,618 --> 01:27:36,639
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a very stupid name for that song.

1180
01:27:37,259 --> 01:27:43,120
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also, obviously, Undo 12 was in there, which is another one that was rumored to be in there.

1181
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:49,821
[SPEAKER_07]: And Scorched Moon, which I'm sure we'll hear later, was another one that was in there, which is pretty cool.

1182
01:27:50,421 --> 01:27:53,782
[SPEAKER_08]: And see, now, what was interesting about the whole DDR Extreme thing was

1183
01:27:54,324 --> 01:27:57,965
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, you had a new remix by 2MB, which was Max Period.

1184
01:27:58,545 --> 01:28:12,250
[SPEAKER_09]: And second... And second of all, Max Period... Max Period, which was... Don't interrupt, Loki.

1185
01:28:13,210 --> 01:28:19,412
[SPEAKER_09]: So, also, you have Max Period, which is, you know, people are kind of hearing that song going, okay, well, is this the end of DDR?

1186
01:28:19,552 --> 01:28:20,332
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, is this like...

1187
01:28:21,152 --> 01:28:21,872
[SPEAKER_09]: What's this mean?

1188
01:28:21,912 --> 01:28:29,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Because obviously when we play it later on, and for those that have already heard it, it's got the part, thank you for playing, and all that stuff.

1189
01:28:30,574 --> 01:28:31,894
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a really weird song.

1190
01:28:32,454 --> 01:28:35,474
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of gives you the impression that it's over and done with.

1191
01:28:36,295 --> 01:28:40,055
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing more other than this compilation crap that's coming out.

1192
01:28:41,275 --> 01:28:50,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, another thing also, which is interesting, kind of unrelated to the whole thing, is that I was looking...

1193
01:28:51,249 --> 01:29:04,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I was looking actually in the Max 2 disc, and you know how you can pull up, because every single remix, or every single game that comes out has a full list of all the songs.

1194
01:29:04,994 --> 01:29:12,396
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty much a master list of all the songs that are actually going to be in the consumer mixes and arcade mixes and whatnot.

1195
01:29:12,476 --> 01:29:14,397
[SPEAKER_09]: So you'll have this giant master list.

1196
01:29:15,037 --> 01:29:18,458
[SPEAKER_09]: And Max 2 USA, it's

1197
01:29:18,911 --> 01:29:29,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much a compilation up to DDR Extreme and also with, I believe, the Ultramix, which is kind of neat.

1198
01:29:29,715 --> 01:29:41,519
[SPEAKER_07]: But one of the things that I found in there, which was quite interesting, was there's yet another Max remix that's going to be coming out pretty soon, which I have to find my list.

1199
01:29:41,719 --> 01:29:42,179
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, here we go.

1200
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:43,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1201
01:29:45,396 --> 01:29:48,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's one of the songs that was in there that was kind of interesting.

1202
01:29:48,677 --> 01:29:54,159
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Maximimizer, which is kind of a weird name.

1203
01:29:54,519 --> 01:29:55,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Maximimizer, I guess?

1204
01:29:55,859 --> 01:29:57,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Maximimizer.

1205
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:01,681
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess maybe that might be the new Max for Ultramix, maybe?

1206
01:30:02,422 --> 01:30:02,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

1207
01:30:03,642 --> 01:30:08,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I don't think that anyone in their right mind would actually name a song Maximimizer other than Kusami.

1208
01:30:10,024 --> 01:30:13,145
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was interesting.

1209
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:16,480
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, that's pretty much all the news.

1210
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to read these songs that you have on your list there?

1211
01:30:18,901 --> 01:30:19,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll read them.

1212
01:30:19,421 --> 01:30:22,363
[SPEAKER_09]: These are songs that are going to be coming out or were going to come out.

1213
01:30:22,623 --> 01:30:24,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, for instance, there's some of them that I recognize.

1214
01:30:25,104 --> 01:30:27,745
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them, Stronger, by Britney Spears.

1215
01:30:28,446 --> 01:30:32,227
[SPEAKER_07]: That was rumored to be in... Euromix 2, right?

1216
01:30:32,307 --> 01:30:34,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it was in Euromix 2, but it might have been.

1217
01:30:35,009 --> 01:30:38,030
[SPEAKER_07]: The Things That You Do, Hula Radio Mix.

1218
01:30:38,630 --> 01:30:40,311
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was also in Euromix 2.

1219
01:30:40,451 --> 01:30:41,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Tammo was in Euromix 2.

1220
01:30:42,012 --> 01:30:43,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Funk Boogie, I have no idea what that is.

1221
01:30:44,389 --> 01:30:47,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Addicted to the Bass, I believe, was Ultramix.

1222
01:30:48,412 --> 01:30:51,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Disco 2000, I have no idea which one that would be.

1223
01:30:52,434 --> 01:30:54,655
[SPEAKER_09]: It Takes More, I don't know.

1224
01:30:55,316 --> 01:31:00,179
[SPEAKER_09]: I Would Die For You, and For You being number four in U. I don't know what that is.

1225
01:31:00,199 --> 01:31:03,181
[SPEAKER_08]: I keep thinking of the Garbage song, but that's number one crush.

1226
01:31:03,921 --> 01:31:06,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Shake Your Body, which I don't know what it is.

1227
01:31:06,963 --> 01:31:08,044
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't recognize any of these songs.

1228
01:31:08,164 --> 01:31:11,766
[SPEAKER_09]: One Step Closer is going to be in the new Dancing Stage Fever, I know that.

1229
01:31:12,284 --> 01:31:14,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Freak Like Me might also be in there.

1230
01:31:15,726 --> 01:31:24,091
[SPEAKER_08]: When You Look At Me is the Christina Milan song from... It's a song that we have in rotation on the station, actually.

1231
01:31:24,511 --> 01:31:25,551
[SPEAKER_08]: I recognize the song.

1232
01:31:25,632 --> 01:31:27,853
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's from Euromix, too, I want to say.

1233
01:31:28,353 --> 01:31:28,953
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so.

1234
01:31:30,534 --> 01:31:33,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Then there's Virtuality, which is another one.

1235
01:31:33,336 --> 01:31:33,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

1236
01:31:38,479 --> 01:31:39,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me it's in DDR.

1237
01:31:39,259 --> 01:31:40,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's in DDR.

1238
01:31:41,368 --> 01:31:43,149
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear it is.

1239
01:31:43,369 --> 01:31:47,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Dizzy, which I don't know what that is.

1240
01:31:47,112 --> 01:31:49,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Darn, from back here it looked like dirty and I got excited.

1241
01:31:50,575 --> 01:31:52,716
[SPEAKER_09]: 2020 Vision, which is, I don't know.

1242
01:31:53,397 --> 01:31:55,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Maximizer, which is interesting.

1243
01:31:55,418 --> 01:31:58,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Saturday Night Live, or Saturday Night Love, actually.

1244
01:31:59,241 --> 01:32:04,905
[SPEAKER_09]: And those are the new songs to expect to see on some... Clarification, what was the Funk B one?

1245
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:07,967
[SPEAKER_09]: What was it?

1246
01:32:07,987 --> 01:32:08,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Funk Boogie.

1247
01:32:08,427 --> 01:32:08,487
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1248
01:32:11,502 --> 01:32:16,286
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea what those are, but I guess they're going to be coming out later on in some release to look for them.

1249
01:32:17,987 --> 01:32:22,971
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be interesting to look at the DDR Extreme list because you're going to have even more of an update list on that too.

1250
01:32:23,551 --> 01:32:24,792
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't wait to hack that disc.

1251
01:32:26,513 --> 01:32:27,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes I can.

1252
01:32:28,074 --> 01:32:28,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I can wait.

1253
01:32:29,275 --> 01:32:31,357
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to have to wait until Tuesday at least.

1254
01:32:32,538 --> 01:32:32,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1255
01:32:33,723 --> 01:32:38,165
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's hoping UPS doesn't say, you know, screw you guys and decide to wait until Wednesday or whatever.

1256
01:32:38,385 --> 01:32:39,685
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they deliver the Rockland.

1257
01:32:39,705 --> 01:32:40,165
[SPEAKER_08]: That's close.

1258
01:32:40,265 --> 01:32:42,486
[SPEAKER_08]: UPS is, you know, fuck me over before.

1259
01:32:43,207 --> 01:32:45,027
[SPEAKER_08]: But, yeah, that's all that's new.

1260
01:32:45,848 --> 01:32:48,449
[SPEAKER_08]: That and Party Collection coming out, but we already know about that.

1261
01:32:49,009 --> 01:32:52,190
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR Party Collection coming out at the end of the year, right?

1262
01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:54,751
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I want to fork out the money for that.

1263
01:32:55,331 --> 01:32:58,472
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to have to have the Butterfly video, I figure, in order for me to pay for it.

1264
01:32:58,492 --> 01:33:00,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get it, because that's December, so that's a ways away.

1265
01:33:01,753 --> 01:33:02,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we'll see.

1266
01:33:02,614 --> 01:33:02,954
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

1267
01:33:03,564 --> 01:33:07,427
[SPEAKER_08]: The next one we're going to be waiting for, though, other than Ultra Mix.

1268
01:33:08,007 --> 01:33:09,728
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I can't wait for DDR Xbox.

1269
01:33:09,788 --> 01:33:11,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Is anybody in our little circle going to be getting it?

1270
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:12,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie?

1271
01:33:13,391 --> 01:33:14,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, you're going to have to cash it out.

1272
01:33:14,331 --> 01:33:17,934
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll probably have an Xbox by then, because obviously we know that they're probably going to drop the price.

1273
01:33:18,234 --> 01:33:22,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because as you guys know, GameCube dropped to $99.

1274
01:33:22,617 --> 01:33:27,921
[SPEAKER_08]: PlayStation 2 is rumored to be having meetings talking about doing the same thing by next week.

1275
01:33:27,961 --> 01:33:31,703
[SPEAKER_08]: And supposedly they sent promotional material to Target already that says, $99, PlayStation 2 is

1276
01:33:33,339 --> 01:33:35,941
[SPEAKER_08]: So if that happens, Xbox is going to have to.

1277
01:33:36,201 --> 01:33:37,322
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not going to have a choice.

1278
01:33:37,342 --> 01:33:38,743
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to have to drop the 99 as well.

1279
01:33:39,403 --> 01:33:42,225
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also those N-Gages, they suck.

1280
01:33:46,308 --> 01:33:46,789
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh my god.

1281
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:51,912
[SPEAKER_21]: I was so excited when Dan got me Puyo Puyo for our N-Gage.

1282
01:33:52,973 --> 01:33:53,533
[SPEAKER_21]: And you know what?

1283
01:33:54,294 --> 01:33:54,834
[SPEAKER_21]: It sucks.

1284
01:33:55,054 --> 01:33:56,716
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is me saying that Puyo Puyo sucks.

1285
01:33:57,836 --> 01:34:00,979
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're sitting here with our, at least we didn't pay for our N-Gage.

1286
01:34:01,239 --> 01:34:01,379
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1287
01:34:02,483 --> 01:34:04,824
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard nothing but awful things about the N-Gage.

1288
01:34:05,164 --> 01:34:06,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, poor Nelly just got beat with a mic.

1289
01:34:07,284 --> 01:34:19,007
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say... Hey, that's a good quote right there.

1290
01:34:19,067 --> 01:34:22,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio, when you taste the suck, you won't feel the pain.

1291
01:34:22,668 --> 01:34:22,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1292
01:34:23,089 --> 01:34:23,909
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

1293
01:34:34,024 --> 01:34:36,865
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to put a link in there for everyone to see.

1294
01:34:36,905 --> 01:34:38,585
[SPEAKER_21]: This is me making fake ads.

1295
01:34:38,625 --> 01:34:40,705
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll do one for Orange Lounge and a bottle of Corona.

1296
01:34:41,065 --> 01:34:41,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1297
01:34:46,346 --> 01:34:50,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the next one I think we have to really wait for is pretty much Karaoke Revolution.

1298
01:34:50,447 --> 01:34:52,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Karaoke Revolution is going to be a big deal.

1299
01:34:52,327 --> 01:34:54,228
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Ultramix is going to be interesting.

1300
01:34:54,268 --> 01:34:59,949
[SPEAKER_08]: The interesting thing about Ultramix is because of these song packs, we'll be talking about Ultramix three months from now.

1301
01:35:00,029 --> 01:35:01,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, they released another song pack.

1302
01:35:02,225 --> 01:35:04,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually kind of looking, you know, it's weird.

1303
01:35:04,146 --> 01:35:08,448
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually really want an Xbox all of a sudden because I want Xbox Live.

1304
01:35:08,868 --> 01:35:10,148
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want a hacked Xbox.

1305
01:35:10,168 --> 01:35:11,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox Live is the best thing ever.

1306
01:35:11,889 --> 01:35:14,030
[SPEAKER_09]: I want a hacked Xbox so I can download games.

1307
01:35:14,070 --> 01:35:14,690
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hate it.

1308
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:18,632
[SPEAKER_08]: This is like me admitting I like Apolitary Song and admitting I like Bag on the Air.

1309
01:35:18,652 --> 01:35:20,812
[SPEAKER_09]: We need a hacked Xbox.

1310
01:35:22,924 --> 01:35:24,606
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know what the difference is.

1311
01:35:24,646 --> 01:35:26,627
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just going to go to GameStop and get a refurbished one.

1312
01:35:26,687 --> 01:35:28,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the difference of it, okay?

1313
01:35:28,369 --> 01:35:35,214
[SPEAKER_09]: We take an Xbox, we have someone hack it for us, you put in a 120 gig hard drive in there, and then you download games for free, baby.

1314
01:35:35,475 --> 01:35:35,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

1315
01:35:38,577 --> 01:35:41,720
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the worst Austin Powers impression I've ever seen in my life.

1316
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:42,781
[SPEAKER_08]: That wasn't a pressure.

1317
01:35:42,801 --> 01:35:44,062
[SPEAKER_08]: But you went like, yeah, baby.

1318
01:35:44,482 --> 01:35:44,903
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny.

1319
01:35:45,623 --> 01:35:46,224
[SPEAKER_08]: You had to see it.

1320
01:35:49,707 --> 01:35:51,088
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm throwing this mic around badly.

1321
01:35:51,852 --> 01:35:56,098
[SPEAKER_12]: No, the thing that's going to be real interesting about DDRXbox is the sucky pads.

1322
01:35:57,100 --> 01:36:01,906
[SPEAKER_12]: Since we can't plug in, like, ignition, I don't think they make a PlayStation do Xbox converters.

1323
01:36:03,048 --> 01:36:03,388
[SPEAKER_11]: They do?

1324
01:36:04,029 --> 01:36:04,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Good.

1325
01:36:05,331 --> 01:36:06,773
[SPEAKER_11]: I might get an Xbox for that.

1326
01:36:07,074 --> 01:36:07,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Then again, I haven't gotten...

1327
01:36:08,667 --> 01:36:16,033
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm scared to play Xbox Live with DDR.

1328
01:36:16,354 --> 01:36:22,038
[SPEAKER_08]: I can tell you right now my name will not be Sky on there because I don't want you people finding me and seeing how bad I really do suck at DDR.

1329
01:36:22,058 --> 01:36:26,442
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have some other name on DDR Xbox.

1330
01:36:27,002 --> 01:36:29,684
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll use a disguised voice whenever I talk on the headset.

1331
01:36:29,704 --> 01:36:32,146
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be like, I'll use my British accent.

1332
01:36:33,127 --> 01:36:34,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm going to play DDR.

1333
01:36:34,889 --> 01:36:35,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a jolly good time.

1334
01:36:37,171 --> 01:36:37,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Crikey.

1335
01:36:39,383 --> 01:36:39,883
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be me.

1336
01:36:43,585 --> 01:36:47,686
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, yeah, I don't want to like the Xbox, but I'm going to have to.

1337
01:36:47,867 --> 01:36:55,910
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really want to play PSO on the Xbox, because somebody left their GameCube PSO for their Xbox PSO.

1338
01:36:56,990 --> 01:36:59,331
[SPEAKER_21]: It's because we already had the Xbox Live account.

1339
01:36:59,651 --> 01:37:05,574
[SPEAKER_21]: For some reason, they closed my GameCube account, so I just decided that I would play on the Xbox.

1340
01:37:07,993 --> 01:37:16,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Maren says she's going to be, if you see a Sky OLR on DDRXbox, that's Maren.

1341
01:37:19,998 --> 01:37:22,138
[SPEAKER_08]: The DDRXbox screens look very nice.

1342
01:37:22,218 --> 01:37:24,960
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually kind of, I'm excited about it.

1343
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:26,420
[SPEAKER_08]: It's weird.

1344
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:27,621
[SPEAKER_21]: They're arrows.

1345
01:37:27,641 --> 01:37:29,001
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a picture for it, actually.

1346
01:37:29,441 --> 01:37:31,362
[SPEAKER_21]: It's in the GameStop promo books.

1347
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,302
[SPEAKER_21]: and it's got like all sorts of characters on there.

1348
01:37:34,322 --> 01:37:36,004
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll bring it next week.

1349
01:37:36,024 --> 01:37:39,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, the cover of DDR Ultramix is like a big DDR character orgy.

1350
01:37:40,649 --> 01:37:41,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Who cares?

1351
01:37:41,229 --> 01:37:43,031
[SPEAKER_08]: It's arrows and music.

1352
01:37:43,211 --> 01:37:45,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Let it stick to arrows and music.

1353
01:37:45,073 --> 01:37:45,754
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's pretty.

1354
01:37:46,154 --> 01:37:48,096
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty arrows and pretty music.

1355
01:37:48,857 --> 01:37:49,537
All right.

1356
01:37:57,340 --> 01:37:58,861
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we'll take a quick break.

1357
01:38:01,382 --> 01:38:02,782
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when we come back, we'll do the cage match.

1358
01:38:05,543 --> 01:38:09,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Because our chat room is demanding a cage match, so we will have to give it to them.

1359
01:38:10,465 --> 01:38:13,686
[SPEAKER_08]: In this break, I think we will finally play the max period.

1360
01:38:15,567 --> 01:38:17,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you guys have been dying to hear it.

1361
01:38:17,768 --> 01:38:18,428
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll hear that.

1362
01:38:18,868 --> 01:38:21,789
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to hear a stupid barber.

1363
01:38:21,809 --> 01:38:23,190
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to hear a stupid barber.

1364
01:38:24,156 --> 01:38:29,858
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we'll play Think You Better D, the original mix, because I fucked up last time and I actually played I Need You instead.

1365
01:38:29,938 --> 01:38:32,339
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to actually hear the original mix of Think You Better D this break.

1366
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:35,561
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we come back, we'll do the cage match and talk about more stuff.

1367
01:38:35,641 --> 01:38:38,202
[SPEAKER_08]: More news, more fun, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

Thank you for watching!

Outro Music

1372
01:43:57,711 --> 01:44:00,574
[SPEAKER_16]: Come on baby, won't you be my girl?

1373
01:44:00,594 --> 01:44:04,359
[SPEAKER_16]: Come on girl, let me rock your world Come on baby, won't you be my girl?

1374
01:44:04,599 --> 01:44:09,185
Come on girl, let me rock your world Look around, look around, look around now The most important thing

1375
01:44:35,801 --> 01:44:45,463
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.

1376
01:44:45,823 --> 01:44:50,824
[SPEAKER_22]: And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

1377
01:44:51,604 --> 01:44:57,606
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

1378
01:44:57,926 --> 01:44:59,786
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

1379
01:45:00,407 --> 01:45:05,208
[SPEAKER_22]: Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

1380
01:45:25,596 --> 01:45:33,681
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, Max Resurrection and Neomax suck, and they will never be in DDR, and so stop asking, stop wanting, get over it.

1381
01:45:33,861 --> 01:45:38,903
[SPEAKER_08]: When real music gets made, it will be put in the DDR, not this crappy fan-made shit.

1382
01:45:39,204 --> 01:45:40,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you.

1383
01:45:40,924 --> 01:45:42,305
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, no one could hear that, you're not mic'd.

1384
01:45:42,365 --> 01:45:47,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I said I laughed out so you could hear me.

1385
01:45:47,368 --> 01:45:51,130
[SPEAKER_08]: So a little bit of the discussion from commercial break carrying over to the show.

1386
01:45:51,190 --> 01:45:51,470
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1387
01:45:51,510 --> 01:45:51,830
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1388
01:45:51,950 --> 01:45:52,231
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1389
01:45:53,171 --> 01:45:53,471
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1390
01:45:53,731 --> 01:45:53,972
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1391
01:45:54,412 --> 01:45:54,692
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1392
01:45:56,843 --> 01:46:03,885
[SPEAKER_08]: You do that again, I'm going to shove that ferret so far up your ass that you'll be pooping ferret noises.

1393
01:46:03,905 --> 01:46:12,028
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so easy and never fails to be entertaining.

1394
01:46:12,048 --> 01:46:17,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, won't Max Resurrection and Neo Max be in your sim on your big arcade machine?

1395
01:46:17,870 --> 01:46:18,070
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1396
01:46:25,461 --> 01:46:27,082
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll purposely be leaving them out?

1397
01:46:29,843 --> 01:46:31,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I have like 27 max remixes.

1398
01:46:31,964 --> 01:46:33,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I really don't need them.

1399
01:46:33,825 --> 01:46:36,146
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna eliminate it down to like three or four.

1400
01:46:36,286 --> 01:46:38,227
[SPEAKER_08]: But will the Legend of Trance be in there?

1401
01:46:39,328 --> 01:46:40,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, maybe.

1402
01:46:41,569 --> 01:46:44,751
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty long, so of course it's gonna be in there.

1403
01:46:44,771 --> 01:46:45,511
[SPEAKER_08]: It's mine!

1404
01:46:46,972 --> 01:46:48,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine was better anyways.

1405
01:46:48,593 --> 01:46:53,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I do think Legend of Trance was better than the other songs.

1406
01:46:53,035 --> 01:46:53,535
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, okay.

1407
01:46:53,995 --> 01:46:55,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Neomax is okay.

1408
01:46:55,606 --> 01:46:58,507
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like they sat there all cool because they're doing like piano noises.

1409
01:46:58,687 --> 01:46:59,688
[SPEAKER_08]: It just sounds like MIDI.

1410
01:47:00,408 --> 01:47:05,650
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like StarMine, you know, when that was made, that was actually pretty good.

1411
01:47:05,911 --> 01:47:14,614
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if you get like Onokin, man, to do a remix of like Max 300 or something, or even The Legend of Max, that would be awesome.

1412
01:47:14,634 --> 01:47:22,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, I mean, obviously, what we're going to see here in the cage match, Onokin did my pick for the cage match last week, and he made Paranoia pretty kick-ass, so...

1413
01:47:23,433 --> 01:47:27,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to see him take on Mac, so, well, try that.

1414
01:47:28,134 --> 01:47:28,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1415
01:47:28,774 --> 01:47:43,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, during the commercial break, in the chat room I was talking about, I was poking fun at one of our people in the chat room who's having some trouble typing tonight because they're missing some keys, and I was suggesting some Mavis Beacon, and I was just thinking about, like, how hot Mavis Beacon is, man.

1416
01:47:43,417 --> 01:47:44,578
[SPEAKER_08]: She's rawr.

1417
01:47:46,878 --> 01:47:49,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Has anyone ever seen Mavis?

1418
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:50,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kidding, I'm kidding.

1419
01:47:51,055 --> 01:47:53,976
[SPEAKER_08]: How many versions of Mavis Beacon teaches typing have we had?

1420
01:47:53,996 --> 01:47:55,956
[SPEAKER_08]: They're on like version 15 I think I saw.

1421
01:47:55,996 --> 01:47:57,397
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1422
01:47:57,497 --> 01:47:59,717
[SPEAKER_21]: I never ever took any typing classes ever.

1423
01:47:59,917 --> 01:48:00,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Me neither.

1424
01:48:00,818 --> 01:48:02,578
[SPEAKER_08]: I learned how to type on my Commodore 64.

1425
01:48:04,459 --> 01:48:10,640
[SPEAKER_21]: I learned how to type out of the sense of competition with my roommate.

1426
01:48:11,380 --> 01:48:14,181
[SPEAKER_21]: My roommate at the time was a secretary and she could type really fast.

1427
01:48:14,704 --> 01:48:21,269
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, out of a whole sense of competition and wanting to keep up with people in chat rooms, I can now type at my best at 90 words a minute.

1428
01:48:22,651 --> 01:48:25,273
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what Iguana Girl and I used to do when we worked together.

1429
01:48:25,293 --> 01:48:30,157
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd have little competitions, just friendly banter to see who could do more issues in an hour type thing.

1430
01:48:31,378 --> 01:48:33,239
[SPEAKER_08]: We were the two best workers in that whole fucking building.

1431
01:48:35,061 --> 01:48:37,423
[SPEAKER_21]: Even when I'm under stress, I can still type at 70 to 80.

1432
01:48:37,463 --> 01:48:37,663
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1433
01:48:41,115 --> 01:48:42,656
[SPEAKER_21]: And I type with perfect grammar.

1434
01:48:42,756 --> 01:48:52,158
[SPEAKER_08]: I suggest if you want to learn how to type, you buy yourself a Commodore 64, because those computers are the shit, and they have the computer inside the keyboard.

1435
01:48:52,499 --> 01:48:53,559
[SPEAKER_08]: How cool is that?

1436
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:57,060
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can play Donkey Kong.

1437
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:00,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, shall we get into tonight's cage match?

1438
01:49:01,821 --> 01:49:02,161
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure.

1439
01:49:06,803 --> 01:49:10,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Last week, in the Orange Lounge Radio cage match,

1440
01:49:12,478 --> 01:49:19,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki's pick won, and he picked a remix of Paranoia called P8107 by, who is it again?

1441
01:49:20,744 --> 01:49:22,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Ono Ken, and that was the winner.

1442
01:49:23,070 --> 01:49:26,813
[SPEAKER_08]: It won in a pretty overwhelming response by the chatroom.

1443
01:49:26,833 --> 01:49:28,093
[SPEAKER_08]: The chatroom really, really liked it.

1444
01:49:28,153 --> 01:49:29,734
[SPEAKER_08]: So will they like it two weeks in a row?

1445
01:49:29,755 --> 01:49:30,195
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

1446
01:49:30,535 --> 01:49:35,819
[SPEAKER_08]: We're only going to play a clip for you guys because it won last week, but nevertheless, you can vote for it tonight.

1447
01:49:35,879 --> 01:49:38,420

[SPEAKER_08]: This is P8107.

[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, what is your pick for tonight?

1461
01:51:36,811 --> 01:51:37,371
[SPEAKER_21]: I forgot.

1462
01:51:37,592 --> 01:51:38,172
[SPEAKER_21]: What did I pick?

1463
01:51:38,192 --> 01:51:41,034
[SPEAKER_21]: What did I pick?

1464
01:51:41,515 --> 01:51:44,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Your song is a group called Turbo Black Cat.

1465
01:51:44,437 --> 01:51:46,099
[SPEAKER_21]: It's one I got from Justin.

1466
01:51:48,692 --> 01:51:50,573
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a remix of Black Cat by Turbo.

1467
01:51:50,593 --> 01:51:51,213
[SPEAKER_21]: It's in Korean.

1468
01:51:51,253 --> 01:51:51,674

1469
01:51:52,514 --> 01:51:53,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so here it is.

1470
01:51:53,615 --> 01:51:55,135

[SPEAKER_08]: It's Jamie's pick.

1472
01:51:56,756 --> 01:51:58,797
[SPEAKER_08]: And you get to hear the whole thing because it's a new pick.

1473
01:51:59,417 --> 01:52:03,379

01:52:03,499 --> 01:52:04,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy.

1475
01:52:08,342 --> 01:52:08,962
It's a dream.

[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, song number two, Turbo with Black Cat, the History Remix.

1483
01:55:14,267 --> 01:55:16,629
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm being told that was the pick in Tourney Mix 4, actually.

1484
01:55:16,649 --> 01:55:19,871
[SPEAKER_21]: See, I don't know, because I don't keep up with Tourney Mix, and I don't play Step Mania.

1485
01:55:19,971 --> 01:55:20,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there you go.

1486
01:55:20,952 --> 01:55:21,532
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's okay.

1487
01:55:21,732 --> 01:55:23,393
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, who cares?

1488
01:55:23,453 --> 01:55:24,934
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about the song, not about the step file.

1489
01:55:24,974 --> 01:55:27,096
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Jamie, would you care to rank your own pick?

1490
01:55:27,376 --> 01:55:28,136
[SPEAKER_21]: Eh, I'd give it an 8.

1491
01:55:28,217 --> 01:55:30,718
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, it actually wasn't my first pick.

1492
01:55:31,178 --> 01:55:37,923
[SPEAKER_21]: When I went to go check how long it was, it was 12 minutes, and I can't edit it down that small, so this was my next pick, and it was pretty good.

1493
01:55:38,379 --> 01:55:42,370
[SPEAKER_21]: And one of these days, though, I am going to bring him to you.

1494
01:55:42,430 --> 01:55:45,780
[SPEAKER_08]: My thoughts are that's the gayest Pump It Up song ever, and it gets a 6.9.

1495
01:55:50,251 --> 01:55:51,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I never did like Black Cat.

1496
01:55:52,512 --> 01:55:58,976
[SPEAKER_09]: It was good up to when The Sims kicked in, then it just started reminding me of, like, We Like to Party by the Venga Boys.

1497
01:56:01,237 --> 01:56:03,538
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Venga Boys are, like, so 10 years ago.

1498
01:56:04,758 --> 01:56:10,501
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh, I give it a... I give it an 8, because it was alright.

1499
01:56:12,162 --> 01:56:14,583
[SPEAKER_08]: It was catchy, but I ignored most of it.

1500
01:56:15,724 --> 01:56:16,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Bradley, what'd you think?

1501
01:56:16,804 --> 01:56:18,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was pretty good.

1502
01:56:23,903 --> 01:56:24,943
[SPEAKER_06]: You killed my butt.

1503
01:56:25,764 --> 01:56:26,324
[SPEAKER_08]: That's okay.

1504
01:56:26,864 --> 01:56:27,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was pretty good.

1505
01:56:28,245 --> 01:56:29,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give it an eight.

1506
01:56:30,606 --> 01:56:31,687
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, an eight from Bradley.

1507
01:56:31,887 --> 01:56:32,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Andrew.

1508
01:56:33,807 --> 01:56:34,488
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all right.

1509
01:56:34,528 --> 01:56:35,088
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard better.

1510
01:56:35,108 --> 01:56:35,828
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe a six.

1511
01:56:37,749 --> 01:56:41,051
[SPEAKER_12]: Honesty, best policy, put the ferret down.

1512
01:56:43,212 --> 01:56:43,512
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1513
01:56:44,716 --> 01:56:46,197
[SPEAKER_08]: So a six from 23rd Magus.

1514
01:56:46,277 --> 01:56:46,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, there you go.

1515
01:56:46,977 --> 01:56:47,558
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, the ferret.

1516
01:56:47,778 --> 01:56:48,338
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what?

1517
01:56:48,438 --> 01:56:52,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Our opinions don't mean shit because it's your votes that ultimately decide it.

1518
01:56:52,561 --> 01:56:54,802
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, it's like American Idol like that.

1519
01:56:55,223 --> 01:56:56,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, here's my pick.

1520
01:56:56,763 --> 01:57:01,446
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an artist I actually put in the cage match like four weeks ago, I think.

1521
01:57:01,466 --> 01:57:03,267
[SPEAKER_21]: You can't pick an... Oh, artist.

1522
01:57:03,628 --> 01:57:05,809
[SPEAKER_08]: An artist that I put in the cage match like four weeks ago.

1523
01:57:06,930 --> 01:57:11,933
[SPEAKER_08]: But I like this song like three times more than the song that I put in originally.

1524
01:57:12,433 --> 01:57:12,933
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it's

1525
01:57:14,145 --> 01:57:17,247
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an old favorite family of mine to be put in the cage match.

1526
01:57:17,327 --> 01:57:18,867
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Danny Minow tonight.

1527
01:57:19,528 --> 01:57:21,409
[SPEAKER_08]: And the song is All I Want to Do.

1528
01:57:21,569 --> 01:57:22,869
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not the Sheryl Crow song.

1529
01:57:23,350 --> 01:57:24,030
[SPEAKER_08]: It's even better.

1530
01:57:25,171 --> 01:57:25,951
[SPEAKER_08]: So enjoy this.

1531
01:57:25,991 --> 01:57:26,771
[SPEAKER_08]: This is song number three.

1532
01:57:26,791 --> 01:57:28,752
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh my God, I saw a Danny Minow video at Dave & Buster's.

1533
01:57:29,073 --> 01:57:29,573
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you think?

1534
01:57:29,593 --> 01:57:30,253
[SPEAKER_21]: She's such a slut.

1535
01:57:31,234 --> 01:57:32,034
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I love her.

1536
01:57:32,134 --> 01:57:32,714
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, here it is.

1537
01:57:33,135 --> 01:57:35,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Danny Minow with All I Want to Do, my pick for tonight's cage match.

1538
01:57:35,836 --> 01:57:36,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy.

1539
01:57:48,422 --> 01:57:52,027
I wanna do, I wanna do without you I wanna do, I wanna do

1540
01:59:19,248 --> 01:59:19,850
Thanks for watching!

1541
02:00:48,383 --> 02:01:03,853
Take a look inside my heart Tell me what you think you see I may not be the innocent girl that you wanted me to

1542
02:02:06,522 --> 02:02:09,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that was song number three, Danny Minow with All I Wanna Do.

1543
02:02:09,704 --> 02:02:10,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie?

1544
02:02:10,765 --> 02:02:11,185
[SPEAKER_21]: Seven.

1545
02:02:11,205 --> 02:02:12,045
[SPEAKER_21]: It's too repetitive.

1546
02:02:13,186 --> 02:02:13,887
[SPEAKER_21]: And she's a slut.

1547
02:02:14,967 --> 02:02:15,688
[SPEAKER_08]: I give it a ten.

1548
02:02:15,748 --> 02:02:16,288
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.

1549
02:02:16,348 --> 02:02:17,149
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the best song ever.

1550
02:02:17,529 --> 02:02:17,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki?

1551
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:24,633
[SPEAKER_09]: I give it a seven because I've heard that song way too many times because you play it all the time.

1552
02:02:25,914 --> 02:02:26,755
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because it's awesome.

1553
02:02:28,115 --> 02:02:28,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Bradley?

1554
02:02:30,117 --> 02:02:30,857
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

1555
02:02:32,938 --> 02:02:33,699
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give it a six point five.

1556
02:02:37,530 --> 02:02:43,196
[SPEAKER_12]: After hearing Angel play it on her radio show all the time, it still doesn't get old.

1557
02:02:43,416 --> 02:02:44,737
[SPEAKER_12]: It's still pretty damn good.

1558
02:02:44,757 --> 02:02:45,097
[SPEAKER_12]: I give it a 9.

1559
02:02:46,519 --> 02:02:46,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1560
02:02:47,620 --> 02:02:50,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, remember, our votes don't mean shit, though.

1561
02:02:50,102 --> 02:02:53,545
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your votes that count, so place vote now.

1562
02:02:53,785 --> 02:02:56,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry, we actually have to recap before we place vote now.

1563
02:02:56,848 --> 02:02:59,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Song number one you can vote for tonight, last week's winner, P8107.

1564
02:03:07,817 --> 02:03:12,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, song number two you can vote for, Turbo with Black Cat, the History remix.

1565
02:03:13,181 --> 02:03:17,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, and song number three you can vote for tonight is Danny Minow with All I Wanna Do.

1566
02:03:17,604 --> 02:03:17,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1567
02:03:36,636 --> 02:03:38,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Place votes now.

1568
02:03:38,657 --> 02:03:41,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Send those votes to private message to Sky in our chat room.

1569
02:03:46,658 --> 02:03:49,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so we'll tally those votes in a little bit.

1570
02:03:49,079 --> 02:03:52,160
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, more witty banter.

1571
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:57,341
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought I'd read this story for you guys and get your thought on this.

1572
02:03:57,401 --> 02:04:01,582
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a story coming from BoycottRIAA.com.

1573
02:04:01,822 --> 02:04:02,542
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, that page.

1574
02:04:02,642 --> 02:04:03,763
[SPEAKER_08]: One of our favorite websites.

1575
02:04:06,835 --> 02:04:07,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the headline.

1576
02:04:08,075 --> 02:04:10,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Kazaa plans to end free music.

1577
02:04:11,456 --> 02:04:13,997
[SPEAKER_08]: This was sent by one of our chatroom loyalists.

1578
02:04:14,697 --> 02:04:17,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Charmin Networks, like toilet paper.

1579
02:04:18,659 --> 02:04:24,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Charmin Networks appears to have finally crossed the line with a bid to get into bed with the big five record labels in the RIAA.

1580
02:04:25,741 --> 02:04:32,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Kazaa backs plans that could spell an end to the days of free music is the headline in the October 10th edition of Australia's The Age.

1581
02:04:33,183 --> 02:04:36,504
[SPEAKER_08]: And Australia is, you'll recall, the place Kazaa calls home.

1582
02:04:37,079 --> 02:04:44,562
[SPEAKER_08]: The world's most popular song swapping network, Kazaa, has thrown its weight behind a plan to start billing song swappers for their music downloads, says the article.

1583
02:04:45,283 --> 02:04:50,365
[SPEAKER_08]: The proposal, which could finally end the days of the free lunch for millions of music fans, has been put to big U.S.

1584
02:04:50,425 --> 02:04:56,828
[SPEAKER_08]: record labels at the same time as the new legitimate version of the former file swapping giant Napster is launched in the U.S.

1585
02:04:57,408 --> 02:05:06,092
[SPEAKER_08]: The idea is to phase in a billing mechanism for peer-to-peer networks, such as Kazaa and Morpheus, that allow users to copy music directly from each other's hard drives, she states.

1586
02:05:08,223 --> 02:05:17,067
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you guys think?

1587
02:05:18,528 --> 02:05:21,029
[SPEAKER_21]: First of all, they have no real way to track something like that.

1588
02:05:24,310 --> 02:05:31,394
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, this is pretty much just like Napster was, where they're focusing just on Napster or just on Kazaa.

1589
02:05:31,594 --> 02:05:35,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't they realize that people have already left the BitTorrent or WinMX or something like that?

1590
02:05:36,417 --> 02:05:45,202
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just going to drop ship on one and go to another sharing service like WinMX or something like that.

1591
02:05:45,562 --> 02:05:54,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Trust me, for everyone that comes up or converts over to pay-only, you're going to have five more free ones pop up in its place.

1592
02:05:55,088 --> 02:05:56,909
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing they can do to stop it.

1593
02:05:57,510 --> 02:05:59,411
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't even a victory on their part.

1594
02:05:59,451 --> 02:06:00,131
[SPEAKER_09]: This is nothing.

1595
02:06:00,191 --> 02:06:01,532
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just another company...

1596
02:06:01,997 --> 02:06:06,600
[SPEAKER_09]: that they're going to try to create that's going to go under super fast, just like Napster did.

1597
02:06:07,561 --> 02:06:09,682
[SPEAKER_09]: So, alright, keep trying.

1598
02:06:12,123 --> 02:06:16,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what do you think, 23rd Magus?

1599
02:06:16,826 --> 02:06:21,409
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, uh, sure, sure, let Kazaa go to pay.

1600
02:06:21,870 --> 02:06:30,295
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm still going to use Kazaa Light, still going to go on the same network, still going to get the same shit for free, they can't track me, more power to them, I don't care.

1601
02:06:37,133 --> 02:06:38,153
[SPEAKER_12]: and the crowd goes silent.

1602
02:06:38,173 --> 02:06:39,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Jamie?

1603
02:06:40,894 --> 02:06:43,474
[SPEAKER_21]: First of all, I don't use WinMX because it's shit.

1604
02:06:45,214 --> 02:06:52,516
[SPEAKER_21]: And it actually has... I've known people, though, who through WinMX have had credit cards stolen off of their computer.

1605
02:06:53,236 --> 02:06:53,676
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wow.

1606
02:06:53,736 --> 02:06:54,916
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so don't use WinMX.

1607
02:06:54,956 --> 02:06:55,556
[SPEAKER_21]: I deleted that.

1608
02:06:55,616 --> 02:06:56,396
[SPEAKER_14]: I use WinMX.

1609
02:06:57,017 --> 02:07:03,558
[SPEAKER_21]: But, yeah, but a friend of mine who is very secure with the systems... It's not the only person who this has happened to.

1610
02:07:04,398 --> 02:07:05,238
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, if you have PayPal...

1611
02:07:06,701 --> 02:07:08,983
[SPEAKER_21]: It broke into a PayPal account that way.

1612
02:07:09,003 --> 02:07:11,325
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I don't have PayPal save my credit card information.

1613
02:07:11,345 --> 02:07:15,389
[SPEAKER_21]: But even so, get that crap off your computer.

1614
02:07:15,489 --> 02:07:16,550
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not good for it.

1615
02:07:16,910 --> 02:07:18,972
[SPEAKER_21]: And I have a feeling that's how I lost my last hard drive.

1616
02:07:20,233 --> 02:07:21,974
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm okay with it.

1617
02:07:21,994 --> 02:07:23,295
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not really using it anyway.

1618
02:07:23,335 --> 02:07:24,476
[SPEAKER_08]: I only use it occasionally.

1619
02:07:24,576 --> 02:07:25,997
[SPEAKER_08]: BitTorrent is really my main thing.

1620
02:07:26,318 --> 02:07:30,001
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm still backing Kazaa+++.

1621
02:07:30,401 --> 02:07:32,523
[SPEAKER_08]: My bank has auto protection against all that stuff.

1622
02:07:32,543 --> 02:07:34,044
[SPEAKER_21]: Because it doesn't log IPs.

1623
02:07:35,014 --> 02:07:37,695
[SPEAKER_21]: It doesn't log your username.

1624
02:07:38,395 --> 02:07:39,595
[SPEAKER_21]: It completely changed mine.

1625
02:07:41,415 --> 02:07:42,416
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it blocks port 80.

1626
02:07:43,676 --> 02:07:46,857
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it keeps you protected.

1627
02:07:46,877 --> 02:07:47,877
[SPEAKER_21]: It keeps you anonymous.

1628
02:07:48,657 --> 02:07:53,558
[SPEAKER_21]: And there can be multiple anonymous at Kazaa.whatever users logged in.

1629
02:07:54,218 --> 02:07:55,539
[SPEAKER_21]: It does not keep a track of it.

1630
02:07:56,179 --> 02:08:02,380
[SPEAKER_21]: And on top of that, if you actually have it do not link to your files, nobody else can download from you.

1631
02:08:03,226 --> 02:08:05,087
[SPEAKER_21]: so they have no way of tracking, no way of knowing what's there.

1632
02:08:06,247 --> 02:08:08,307
[SPEAKER_08]: I always thought Kazaa was stupid anyway.

1633
02:08:08,347 --> 02:08:09,308
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never used it.

1634
02:08:09,448 --> 02:08:10,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate Kazaa.

1635
02:08:10,628 --> 02:08:11,568
[SPEAKER_21]: The new Kazaa is great.

1636
02:08:12,168 --> 02:08:12,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it?

1637
02:08:12,749 --> 02:08:15,429
[SPEAKER_21]: The Kazaa Plus, it's so, it's absolutely easy.

1638
02:08:16,290 --> 02:08:19,390
[SPEAKER_21]: And I downloaded, and on top of that they've even tweaked the program now.

1639
02:08:19,971 --> 02:08:23,692
[SPEAKER_21]: I have had 17 downloads going at one time on Kazaa Plus Plus Plus.

1640
02:08:24,512 --> 02:08:25,112
[SPEAKER_21]: It's beautiful.

1641
02:08:26,052 --> 02:08:26,312
[SPEAKER_21]: So.

1642
02:08:27,473 --> 02:08:29,173
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still a big BitTorrent fan.

1643
02:08:29,233 --> 02:08:30,353
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's the way.

1644
02:08:30,373 --> 02:08:31,734
[SPEAKER_21]: I use BitTorrent for my anime.

1645
02:08:31,954 --> 02:08:32,514
[SPEAKER_08]: And what kind of

1646
02:08:33,360 --> 02:08:38,324
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, it doesn't even have to be webpages, because you can distribute torrents amongst...

1647
02:09:02,984 --> 02:09:04,185
[SPEAKER_09]: IRC Chatrooms.

1648
02:09:05,446 --> 02:09:07,568
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing they're going to be able to do with this.

1649
02:09:07,888 --> 02:09:08,889
[SPEAKER_09]: They're fucked.

1650
02:09:09,289 --> 02:09:11,411
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not going to be able to do anything.

1651
02:09:11,491 --> 02:09:19,898
[SPEAKER_08]: They better be back in iTunes, and they better do it fast, because that's the only... All I've got to say is, all they're doing is they're just fucking stirring up the hornet's nest.

1652
02:09:20,238 --> 02:09:21,399
[SPEAKER_08]: They're making things worse.

1653
02:09:21,459 --> 02:09:28,104
[SPEAKER_08]: People are getting pissed, and they're just going to say, fuck you, instead of downloading the one song I want, now I'm going to download the whole goddamn CD.

1654
02:09:30,046 --> 02:09:30,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Kitty...

1655
02:09:31,499 --> 02:09:33,681
[SPEAKER_12]: Caza Light does not have spyware in it.

1656
02:09:33,922 --> 02:09:36,224
[SPEAKER_12]: The original Caza used to.

1657
02:09:36,484 --> 02:09:39,227
[SPEAKER_12]: They claim now that it never did.

1658
02:09:39,647 --> 02:09:39,988
[SPEAKER_12]: It did.

1659
02:09:40,288 --> 02:09:41,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it is bullshit.

1660
02:09:41,409 --> 02:09:41,669
[SPEAKER_08]: It did.

1661
02:09:41,689 --> 02:09:43,011
[SPEAKER_12]: It had massive spyware.

1662
02:09:44,813 --> 02:09:47,796
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the other thing that I attribute to the loss of my last hard drive over, too.

1663
02:09:48,556 --> 02:09:50,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Adware is our friend.

1664
02:09:51,299 --> 02:09:52,500
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, there's a better program than that.

1665
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:54,402
[SPEAKER_21]: It's called Adware Search and Destroy.

1666
02:09:54,422 --> 02:09:54,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1667
02:09:55,542 --> 02:10:03,807
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, it hunts down any, not just that, but like basic installers, like for Bonzi Buddy or whatever, and gets them off of your computer.

1668
02:10:04,108 --> 02:10:04,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking Gator.

1669
02:10:05,729 --> 02:10:12,213
[SPEAKER_21]: I, uh, with the, I had, actually, um, also WinMX does install spyware on your computer, too.

1670
02:10:13,894 --> 02:10:14,734
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, yes, it does.

1671
02:10:15,255 --> 02:10:20,358
[SPEAKER_21]: Because after, after I was using WinMX, I went and checked, and I had tons of spyware on my computer just from that program.

1672
02:10:22,140 --> 02:10:27,644
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, I actually checked about two months after using Kazaa++ and ran the spyware check and there was nothing.

1673
02:10:28,765 --> 02:10:30,947
[SPEAKER_21]: Other than what would have, you know, come through like a webpage.

1674
02:10:31,227 --> 02:10:32,328
[SPEAKER_21]: But really, it's nothing.

1675
02:10:32,828 --> 02:10:33,469
[SPEAKER_21]: Hardly anything.

1676
02:10:34,129 --> 02:10:38,513
[SPEAKER_21]: Like maybe 10 files as opposed to the 200 and something before with the old Kazaa.

1677
02:10:38,653 --> 02:10:45,258
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you one reason I actually really like WinMxo is that it's the song sharing program of choice in Asia.

1678
02:10:45,834 --> 02:10:50,536
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of good Asian, Korean, Japanese, Chinese stuff on there.

1679
02:10:51,456 --> 02:10:53,637
[SPEAKER_08]: I just... Kazaa, I hate it.

1680
02:10:53,777 --> 02:10:54,378
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate Kazaa.

1681
02:10:54,398 --> 02:10:54,818
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate it.

1682
02:10:56,158 --> 02:10:58,079
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that's just me.

1683
02:10:59,460 --> 02:10:59,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1684
02:11:00,460 --> 02:11:01,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Want to hear tonight's cage match winner?

1685
02:11:02,281 --> 02:11:02,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1686
02:11:02,941 --> 02:11:07,363
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a squeaker tonight, boys and girls, by one stinking vote.

1687
02:11:08,764 --> 02:11:14,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight's winner of the cage match by one stinking vote was the one, the only...

1688
02:11:16,260 --> 02:11:23,246
[SPEAKER_08]: P8107 That was a close one tonight.

1689
02:11:23,347 --> 02:11:27,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Votes were pretty much spread all out tonight, which usually doesn't happen.

1690
02:11:29,072 --> 02:11:33,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh well, Jamie and I will try again next week to dethrone P8101, whatever it is.

1691
02:11:35,438 --> 02:11:38,641
[SPEAKER_08]: P8696969 Alright.

1692
02:11:38,821 --> 02:11:41,043
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to think three weeks in advance for...

1693
02:11:41,747 --> 02:11:44,650
[SPEAKER_21]: I know, you're going to... Because I'm actually going to be gone the Sunday beforehand.

1694
02:11:44,670 --> 02:11:46,051
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to have your work cut out for you.

1695
02:11:46,071 --> 02:11:48,092
[SPEAKER_21]: Because of family deals.

1696
02:11:48,253 --> 02:11:49,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie's going to be gone for three weeks.

1697
02:11:49,834 --> 02:11:50,555
[SPEAKER_08]: What are we going to do?

1698
02:11:51,095 --> 02:11:52,957
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to pre-tape pump up the volume though, right?

1699
02:11:53,277 --> 02:11:57,641
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I might record Tuesday's show and then repeat it while I'm out of town.

1700
02:11:58,461 --> 02:12:00,223
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, the third...

1701
02:12:03,352 --> 02:12:04,133
[SPEAKER_21]: on November 3rd.

1702
02:12:04,933 --> 02:12:07,995
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm actually taking Monday so I can do my show before I go to Alabama.

1703
02:12:08,195 --> 02:12:10,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we'll do a show swap.

1704
02:12:10,136 --> 02:12:12,898
[SPEAKER_21]: So there's only going to be two weeks where it'll be old material.

1705
02:12:13,338 --> 02:12:17,500
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm also going to be doing a special thing that I'm doing as a favor.

1706
02:12:19,381 --> 02:12:19,982
[SPEAKER_21]: More on that later.

1707
02:12:20,222 --> 02:12:21,783
[SPEAKER_21]: But it'll be replayed while I'm out of town.

1708
02:12:21,803 --> 02:12:22,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1709
02:12:24,224 --> 02:12:25,485
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's really about it.

1710
02:12:25,505 --> 02:12:30,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of our spinoff shows, Monday nights on Orange Launch Radio is Vanilla Sky where we talk about

1711
02:12:31,095 --> 02:12:32,976
[SPEAKER_08]: I have an idea for Loki What, Loki?

1712
02:13:05,706 --> 02:13:09,107
[SPEAKER_07]: You should do one with the Sierra games.

1713
02:13:09,127 --> 02:13:10,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember the old Sierra RPGs?

1714
02:13:10,808 --> 02:13:11,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, shit.

1715
02:13:11,628 --> 02:13:12,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Those were the shit.

1716
02:13:13,029 --> 02:13:13,969
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so there.

1717
02:13:14,730 --> 02:13:18,191
[SPEAKER_08]: King's Quest, Police Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, Space Quest.

1718
02:13:18,231 --> 02:13:18,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell yes.

1719
02:13:20,492 --> 02:13:21,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell yes.

1720
02:13:22,273 --> 02:13:23,733
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

1721
02:13:23,813 --> 02:13:24,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1722
02:13:25,854 --> 02:13:26,675
[SPEAKER_07]: What else was I thinking?

1723
02:13:27,815 --> 02:13:32,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming November again, LiveWire on Wednesdays.

1724
02:13:33,171 --> 02:13:33,932
[SPEAKER_09]: and many more.

1725
02:13:55,943 --> 02:13:58,545
[SPEAKER_08]: One Saturday a month coming in 2004.

1726
02:13:59,225 --> 02:14:00,146
[SPEAKER_08]: With prizes.

1727
02:14:00,246 --> 02:14:01,527
[SPEAKER_08]: With actual prizes.

1728
02:14:01,667 --> 02:14:03,168
[SPEAKER_08]: For our chatroom.

1729
02:14:03,808 --> 02:14:08,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, for chatroom and in-studio players.

1730
02:14:09,292 --> 02:14:11,493
[SPEAKER_08]: One winner each, so it'll be cool.

1731
02:14:13,414 --> 02:14:14,595
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be so exciting.

1732
02:14:14,615 --> 02:14:20,599
[SPEAKER_08]: So pretty much imagine Starcade with all the video game playing, with a ton of trivia thrown in, that's what you got.

1733
02:14:21,081 --> 02:14:22,362
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very complex show.

1734
02:14:23,682 --> 02:14:25,363
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to do a lot of stuff.

1735
02:14:25,383 --> 02:14:27,024
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen the rules for this show.

1736
02:14:27,304 --> 02:14:29,845
[SPEAKER_08]: It's insane.

1737
02:14:30,906 --> 02:14:31,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it'll be fun.

1738
02:14:35,388 --> 02:14:35,728
[SPEAKER_08]: I win.

1739
02:14:38,529 --> 02:14:40,030
[SPEAKER_08]: You lose.

1740
02:14:42,011 --> 02:14:44,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, would you like to plug what's on Tuesday nights on this station?

1741
02:14:46,613 --> 02:14:47,033
[SPEAKER_08]: A cookie?

1742
02:14:49,174 --> 02:14:50,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookies of doom-doom.

1743
02:14:51,716 --> 02:14:52,496
[SPEAKER_21]: It's my show.

1744
02:14:53,857 --> 02:14:55,218
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a Triska eating show.

1745
02:14:56,839 --> 02:14:59,340
[SPEAKER_21]: Go ahead, Bob, say something and I'll let you.

1746
02:14:59,660 --> 02:15:00,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1747
02:15:00,981 --> 02:15:07,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Tuesday nights on Orange Lounge Radio at 7 o'clock is the Pump Up the Volume pre-show.

1748
02:15:07,864 --> 02:15:10,045
[SPEAKER_08]: And then at 7.30 is... It's Pump Up the Volume.

1749
02:15:11,086 --> 02:15:15,428
[SPEAKER_21]: Which is where nobody requests anything because you're all... I'm sorry.

1750
02:15:16,328 --> 02:15:19,790
[SPEAKER_21]: Nobody ever requests anything on my show, so I'm like, okay, why am I doing this?

1751
02:15:19,890 --> 02:15:20,030
[SPEAKER_21]: So...

1752
02:15:20,569 --> 02:15:23,712
[SPEAKER_21]: It's basically where you sit for three hours and listen to whatever I feel like playing for you.

1753
02:15:24,833 --> 02:15:30,558
[SPEAKER_21]: If you were in our chat room and requesting songs and I would play them, hello.

1754
02:15:31,959 --> 02:15:32,359
[SPEAKER_21]: It's over at 10.30.

1755
02:15:34,381 --> 02:15:34,801
[SPEAKER_21]: Sometimes.

1756
02:15:37,583 --> 02:15:39,145
[SPEAKER_21]: But that's, yeah, it's some of the volume.

1757
02:15:40,005 --> 02:15:40,746
[SPEAKER_21]: My fun little show.

1758
02:15:42,528 --> 02:15:42,868
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1759
02:15:44,489 --> 02:15:48,252
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what we're going to do, we're going to take a quick break and then we're going to come back and...

1760
02:15:49,585 --> 02:15:54,309
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, we're going to fill 45 minutes somehow with something we'll think is something creative during this break.

1761
02:15:55,069 --> 02:15:56,691
[SPEAKER_08]: List list or match game?

1762
02:15:56,731 --> 02:15:58,312
[SPEAKER_08]: List list or match game or something like that.

1763
02:15:58,332 --> 02:15:59,453
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't done a list list in a while.

1764
02:15:59,473 --> 02:16:05,437
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to do a list list?

1765
02:16:06,038 --> 02:16:07,159
[SPEAKER_08]: What subject do we want to do?

1766
02:16:07,439 --> 02:16:10,341
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we never did do the top ten names for Comcast.

1767
02:16:11,822 --> 02:16:12,202
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1768
02:16:12,703 --> 02:16:16,326
[SPEAKER_21]: I bet for the top three cars you'll never see an initial D game.

1769
02:16:17,066 --> 02:16:17,907
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like cars.

1770
02:16:18,267 --> 02:16:19,068
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't like initial D.

1771
02:16:22,392 --> 02:16:24,793
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we'll think of something.

1772
02:16:25,213 --> 02:16:30,375
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys want to suggest a listless topic, we'll be listening for you guys.

1773
02:16:30,735 --> 02:16:35,057
[SPEAKER_08]: In this break, we're going to hear Sean the Horny Master with Scorching Moon.

1774
02:16:35,097 --> 02:16:40,919
[SPEAKER_08]: That's another Dance Revolution EX consumer track.

1775
02:16:41,619 --> 02:16:44,060
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're going to hear a trance remix of music.

1776
02:16:44,140 --> 02:16:45,440
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know where this came from.

1777
02:16:45,620 --> 02:16:46,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you know where this came from?

1778
02:16:46,741 --> 02:16:48,361
[SPEAKER_08]: The trance remix of music on your computer?

1779
02:16:49,202 --> 02:16:50,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it came from...

1780
02:16:51,385 --> 02:16:54,446
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a transversion of music, it's the Madonna song.

1781
02:16:54,466 --> 02:16:56,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Play a... I think it's a Night In Motion remix one in there.

1782
02:16:56,947 --> 02:16:57,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that next?

1783
02:16:57,948 --> 02:16:58,628
Here, I'll pick something.

1784
02:17:19,707 --> 02:17:22,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Beatmania does Outphase, Sink Into Trance remix.

1785
02:17:23,011 --> 02:17:23,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Lame.

1786
02:17:24,052 --> 02:17:24,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's break away.

1787
02:17:24,893 --> 02:17:25,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that any good?

1788
02:17:26,975 --> 02:17:31,600
[SPEAKER_08]: How about... We could play something from the Nightstyle soundtrack.

1789
02:17:31,660 --> 02:17:32,020
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1790
02:17:32,761 --> 02:17:36,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we'll play your song from last week.

1791
02:17:36,405 --> 02:17:37,046
[SPEAKER_08]: What song was that?

1792
02:17:39,549 --> 02:17:39,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

1793
02:17:40,422 --> 02:17:42,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, the Boom Boom.

1794
02:17:43,424 --> 02:17:44,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us about this mix.

1795
02:17:45,886 --> 02:17:48,588
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a remix of Enigma because their newest album sucked.

1796
02:17:49,568 --> 02:17:50,129
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

1797
02:17:50,149 --> 02:17:53,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we'll be back after this little break.

1798
02:17:53,831 --> 02:17:55,672
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do Sean the Horny Master and Boom Boom.

1799
02:17:55,933 --> 02:17:56,413
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back.

1800
02:22:19,693 --> 02:22:23,556
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we decided to say screw listless, and we're going to do the match game instead.

1801
02:22:23,616 --> 02:22:25,838
[SPEAKER_08]: So in order to do match game, I need some contestants.

1802
02:22:25,898 --> 02:22:27,759
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's tonight's qualifying question.

1803
02:22:28,239 --> 02:22:35,765
[SPEAKER_08]: The first two people in our chat room to send me a private message with the answer to this question will be playing in tonight's Orange Launch Radio match game.

1804
02:22:35,785 --> 02:22:41,469
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to ask you a question from Monday's episode of Vanilla Sky, Video Game Trivia to Bad Music.

1805
02:22:41,569 --> 02:22:42,150
[SPEAKER_08]: So here it is.

1806
02:22:42,590 --> 02:22:43,351
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the question.

1807
02:22:43,431 --> 02:22:46,153
[SPEAKER_08]: First two people to send me the correct answer will play match game tonight.

1808
02:22:46,838 --> 02:23:00,220
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the name of the game put out by Universal, which was similar to Dig Dug, but the object was to collect cherries or kill all the monsters, including ones marked E, X, T, R, and A with your Powerball?

1809
02:23:00,881 --> 02:23:07,062
[SPEAKER_08]: The category, just to help you out for last week's Vanilla Sky video game trivia on Bad Music, was 80s video games.

1810
02:23:07,442 --> 02:23:08,342
[SPEAKER_08]: So, there you go.

1811
02:23:09,662 --> 02:23:10,202
[SPEAKER_08]: One more time.

1812
02:23:10,262 --> 02:23:13,623
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the name of the game put out by Universal, which was similar to Dig Dug,

1813
02:23:14,079 --> 02:23:21,706
[SPEAKER_08]: But the object was to collect cherries or kill all the monsters, including ones marked EXTRNA with your Powerball.

1814
02:23:22,326 --> 02:23:28,331
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, while we get some answers for that, we're going to play another Loki remix here because they're cool and people like them.

1815
02:23:29,172 --> 02:23:32,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to hear the Big Thunder Mountain mix of Stoic again, so we're going to play that.

1816
02:23:33,356 --> 02:23:37,299
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll be back while we get our qualifying contestants for match game.

1817
02:23:37,720 --> 02:23:38,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming back.

1818
02:25:58,576 --> 02:25:59,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hello, we're back.

1819
02:26:00,277 --> 02:26:01,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio here.

1820
02:26:03,078 --> 02:26:07,159
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's time, ladies and gentlemen, to play the Bomani Match Game.

1821
02:26:07,219 --> 02:26:08,619
[SPEAKER_08]: How exciting is that, everybody?

1822
02:26:09,160 --> 02:26:10,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1823
02:26:10,100 --> 02:26:14,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to explain the rules because we have some new contestants tonight who we haven't had play before.

1824
02:26:17,362 --> 02:26:19,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet you want to know who those contestants are, huh?

1825
02:26:19,323 --> 02:26:20,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us, Rob, tell us.

1826
02:26:22,024 --> 02:26:27,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, in tonight's Bomani Match Game, we have Zodiac Knight is contestant number one.

1827
02:26:28,581 --> 02:26:34,703
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a buddy of mine from LiveJournal, so I'm excited to see that he got the correct answer, which was Mr. Do.

1828
02:26:35,103 --> 02:26:35,784
[SPEAKER_08]: We all knew that.

1829
02:26:36,224 --> 02:26:39,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Last week, I tell ya, I don't think any of them got it right.

1830
02:26:39,645 --> 02:26:41,906
[SPEAKER_08]: None of the people here got it right that Mr. Do was a game.

1831
02:26:42,586 --> 02:26:45,627
[SPEAKER_08]: But that was the game with the cherries and the EXTRA monsters.

1832
02:26:47,068 --> 02:26:50,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Contestant number two tonight is AZN Buddy Paul.

1833
02:26:51,604 --> 02:26:51,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool!

1834
02:26:52,124 --> 02:26:54,566
[SPEAKER_08]: He got Mr. Dew, and he was second.

1835
02:26:54,947 --> 02:26:59,130
[SPEAKER_08]: And just in case, we have a standby as well, if one of them should drop.

1836
02:27:00,251 --> 02:27:00,591
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1837
02:27:01,452 --> 02:27:06,696
[SPEAKER_08]: The way the Monty Match Game works is that I'm going to ask a question, and somewhere in that question is a blank.

1838
02:27:06,796 --> 02:27:13,200
[SPEAKER_08]: For instance, the question could be, Arcadian42 went to the store and decided to buy some blank.

1839
02:27:13,601 --> 02:27:17,504
[SPEAKER_08]: So all of our celebrities here in the room will write down what they think should be in the blank.

1840
02:27:17,584 --> 02:27:18,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Propel!

1841
02:27:18,324 --> 02:27:20,386
[SPEAKER_08]: So Propel would be the answer that Jamie went right.

1842
02:27:20,808 --> 02:27:26,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Your job is to send me the answer of a private message that you think is going to match with the most celebrities.

1843
02:27:29,732 --> 02:27:31,273
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm supposed to kick nose styling.

1844
02:27:31,793 --> 02:27:33,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would I kick nose styling, Jamie?

1845
02:27:33,894 --> 02:27:34,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Change your name!

1846
02:27:35,015 --> 02:27:38,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I hope the contestants have an understanding of the rules, yes?

1847
02:27:39,757 --> 02:27:42,818
[SPEAKER_08]: You just send in what you think we're going to say for the blank.

1848
02:27:43,438 --> 02:27:45,079
[SPEAKER_08]: And then for every match, you get a point.

1849
02:27:45,799 --> 02:27:49,001
[SPEAKER_08]: And for every non-match, you get ridiculed horrendously by all of us.

1850
02:27:49,767 --> 02:27:51,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Introducing tonight's celebrities.

1851
02:27:51,188 --> 02:27:54,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Celebrity number one is DarkSakura.

1852
02:27:54,391 --> 02:27:55,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

[SPEAKER_08]: And her latest movie out in theaters now is?

1854
02:27:59,755 --> 02:28:00,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck You, Bitch, Die.

1855
02:28:00,936 --> 02:28:01,336
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1856
02:28:02,637 --> 02:28:08,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Celebrity number two tonight is Bradley, Arcadian42, and he is here tonight to promote?

1857
02:28:09,822 --> 02:28:14,206
[SPEAKER_08]: My world tour event of sitting in front of people and doing nothing.

1858
02:28:14,486 --> 02:28:15,006
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1859
02:28:16,454 --> 02:28:21,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Celebrity number three tonight is the one and only Loki, and he's here tonight to promote hatred.

1860
02:28:25,239 --> 02:28:25,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kidding.

1861
02:28:25,719 --> 02:28:26,740
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you here to promote tonight?

1862
02:28:28,801 --> 02:28:29,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Hatred.

1863
02:28:32,023 --> 02:28:32,423
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1864
02:28:32,983 --> 02:28:33,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Contestant.

1865
02:28:33,543 --> 02:28:35,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Iraqi suicide, baby.

1866
02:28:36,385 --> 02:28:36,765
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1867
02:28:36,925 --> 02:28:42,008
[SPEAKER_08]: And just a hint, contestants, the more you listen to this show and the more inside jokes you know, the more points you will get.

1868
02:28:43,194 --> 02:28:48,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Celebrity number four tonight is 23rd Magus, who's here tonight to promote my ass.

1869
02:28:51,598 --> 02:28:52,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Please leave.

1870
02:28:53,979 --> 02:28:54,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kidding.

1871
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:59,722
[SPEAKER_08]: And celebrity number five tonight is the biggest celebrity of them all, it's me.

1872
02:29:00,403 --> 02:29:02,324
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm here to promote... Your big ego.

1873
02:29:02,664 --> 02:29:03,384
[SPEAKER_08]: My big ego.

1874
02:29:06,526 --> 02:29:06,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1875
02:29:08,347 --> 02:29:10,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm here tonight to promote safe sex for all.

1876
02:29:12,992 --> 02:29:18,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, yes, AZM Buddy Paul sends to me over five months and says, so it's just like the TV show.

1877
02:29:18,573 --> 02:29:22,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's just like the TV show, except we don't want to get sued, so it has a different name.

1878
02:29:23,254 --> 02:29:23,914
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, here we go.

1879
02:29:23,974 --> 02:29:24,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Question number one.

1880
02:29:24,594 --> 02:29:24,914
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys ready?

1881
02:29:24,934 --> 02:29:26,134
[SPEAKER_08]: There's four questions tonight.

1882
02:29:26,174 --> 02:29:27,875
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to write five, but I got lazy.

1883
02:29:29,275 --> 02:29:31,715
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's question number one tonight, boys and girls.

1884
02:29:33,175 --> 02:29:34,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Sky, oh, that's me.

1885
02:29:35,296 --> 02:29:41,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Sky was sad to watch $80 go bye-bye for DDR Extreme to be sent to his house.

1886
02:29:43,439 --> 02:29:43,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn!

1887
02:29:44,359 --> 02:29:45,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Sky exclaimed.

1888
02:29:45,740 --> 02:29:48,441
[SPEAKER_08]: That's $80 I could have spent on blank.

1889
02:29:53,043 --> 02:29:55,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead and send me your answers over private message, contestants.

1890
02:29:56,545 --> 02:29:58,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob was sad to watch $80 go by.

1891
02:29:58,866 --> 02:30:01,247
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're in the chat room, help our contestants.

1892
02:30:01,307 --> 02:30:06,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Give some answers that Zodiac Knight and ASEAN buddy Paul can use.

1893
02:30:06,089 --> 02:30:08,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Just say them out loud in the chat room and maybe they'll take your hint.

1894
02:30:10,031 --> 02:30:13,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Sky was sad to watch $80 go bye-bye for DDR Extreme to be sent to his house.

1895
02:30:13,774 --> 02:30:17,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn, Rob exclaimed, that's $80 I could have spent on blank.

1896
02:30:17,756 --> 02:30:24,581
[SPEAKER_21]: By the way, someone is spelled with an O and an E. It's S-O-M-E-O-N-E.

1897
02:30:27,923 --> 02:30:30,645
[SPEAKER_21]: And Socks is spelled S-U-C-K-S.

1898
02:30:31,245 --> 02:30:35,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie Summers teaches typing, version 2, now available in stores.

1899
02:30:35,128 --> 02:30:36,809
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it's called teaches how to spell.

1900
02:30:37,189 --> 02:30:38,350
[SPEAKER_21]: Use the spell checker if you don't know how.

1901
02:30:39,142 --> 02:30:45,766
[SPEAKER_08]: I have one contestant... I am the Grammar Avenger!

1902
02:30:47,987 --> 02:30:49,087
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm waiting on one other one.

1903
02:30:54,450 --> 02:30:55,350
[SPEAKER_08]: All the celebrities ready?

1904
02:30:57,031 --> 02:30:57,572
[SPEAKER_08]: All the celebrities ready?

1905
02:30:57,592 --> 02:30:58,252
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are all ready?

1906
02:30:58,692 --> 02:31:02,334
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I'm just waiting on one contestant.

1907
02:31:06,496 --> 02:31:07,877
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just waiting on one contestant here.

1908
02:31:10,176 --> 02:31:12,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, suck someone.

1909
02:31:15,180 --> 02:31:16,901
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm interacting with the chat room.

1910
02:31:17,021 --> 02:31:17,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, here we go.

1911
02:31:17,782 --> 02:31:18,523
[SPEAKER_08]: We got both answers.

1912
02:31:18,623 --> 02:31:19,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, you guys ready?

1913
02:31:19,624 --> 02:31:19,984
[SPEAKER_21]: Ding.

1914
02:31:20,785 --> 02:31:21,565
[SPEAKER_21]: Ding dong, man.

1915
02:31:21,645 --> 02:31:22,166
[SPEAKER_21]: Ding dong.

1916
02:31:22,326 --> 02:31:23,247
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, here we go.

1917
02:31:25,328 --> 02:31:27,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear what Zodiac Knight had to say.

1918
02:31:28,871 --> 02:31:32,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob was sad to watch $80 go bye-bye for DDR Extreme to be sent to his house.

1919
02:31:32,774 --> 02:31:33,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn, Rob exclaimed.

1920
02:31:34,136 --> 02:31:38,059
[SPEAKER_08]: That's $80 I could have spent on, Zodiac Knight says, male prostitutes.

1921
02:31:39,272 --> 02:31:49,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Male Prostitutes AZM Buddy Paul says, Damn, that's $80 Skye could have spent on food Are you saying I'm fat?

1922
02:31:51,480 --> 02:31:58,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we have male prostitutes and we have food We'll start with Andrew, what's your answer?

1923
02:32:00,105 --> 02:32:01,806
[SPEAKER_08]: That's $80 he could have spent on?

1924
02:32:01,966 --> 02:32:08,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Chocolate martinis and F-Zero Chocolate martinis and F-Zero Good answer, good answer, but not a match

1925
02:32:09,406 --> 02:32:11,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, that's $80 he could have spent on.

1926
02:32:11,886 --> 02:32:12,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Manhorse.

1927
02:32:13,047 --> 02:32:16,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Manhorse, that's a match with Zodiac Knight.

1928
02:32:16,207 --> 02:32:17,567
[SPEAKER_08]: One point for Zodiac Knight.

1929
02:32:18,528 --> 02:32:21,288
[SPEAKER_08]: So the score is now one to nothing.

1930
02:32:23,128 --> 02:32:28,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Bradley, you've used it for 320 quarters to gamble with.

1931
02:32:28,849 --> 02:32:30,370
[SPEAKER_08]: 320 quarters to gamble with.

1932
02:32:30,510 --> 02:32:33,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good answer, but unfortunately not a match.

1933
02:32:34,410 --> 02:32:37,971
[SPEAKER_08]: My answer, and this would be the correct answer, by the way,

1934
02:32:38,846 --> 02:32:41,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn, that's $80 I could have spent on booze.

1935
02:32:43,948 --> 02:32:48,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, close to a match with food, I don't think the judges rule that a match.

1936
02:32:48,550 --> 02:32:48,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1937
02:32:50,711 --> 02:32:51,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie?

1938
02:32:51,291 --> 02:32:52,731

[SPEAKER_08]: $80 I could have spent on Propel?

1940
02:32:55,372 --> 02:32:56,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent, but not a match.

1941
02:32:56,973 --> 02:32:58,173
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, does that count as food?

1942
02:32:58,474 --> 02:32:58,754
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1943
02:32:59,054 --> 02:33:00,214
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't think it does either.

1944
02:33:00,234 --> 02:33:00,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because you drink it.

1945
02:33:01,455 --> 02:33:02,135
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh...

1946
02:33:02,816 --> 02:33:03,817
[SPEAKER_08]: The score is now 1-0.

1947
02:33:04,357 --> 02:33:07,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Zodiac Knight has one point, and AZM Buddy Paul has no points.

1948
02:33:07,698 --> 02:33:09,579
[SPEAKER_08]: That's okay, because here's his chance to catch up.

2021
02:39:13,530 --> 02:39:15,931
[SPEAKER_12]: It's in the area, right?

2022
02:39:17,111 --> 02:39:18,712

[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, sweet Jesus, you just cut off your...

2026
02:39:26,860 --> 02:39:31,082
[SPEAKER_08]: This is like four or five inside jokes back.

02:39:33,583 --> 02:39:34,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Big black cock.

2028
02:39:37,585 --> 02:39:39,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that would be a match with penis.

2030
02:39:41,286 --> 02:39:44,608

[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2041
02:40:01,990 --> 02:40:02,831

2043
02:40:03,231 --> 02:40:04,312
[SPEAKER_08]: A nice clean answer.

2044
02:40:05,392 --> 02:40:05,732
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2045
02:40:07,634 --> 02:40:07,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

2046
02:40:08,114 --> 02:40:09,595
[SPEAKER_08]: My answer is Sweet Jesus.

2047
02:40:10,395 --> 02:40:13,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I just cut off my nipple just like in Ichi the Killer.

2048
02:40:18,521 --> 02:40:19,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, not a match.

2049
02:40:20,182 --> 02:40:20,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie.

2050
02:40:20,542 --> 02:40:20,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie.

2051
02:40:21,300 --> 02:40:23,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet Jesus, Loki just cut off his foot.

2052
02:40:24,123 --> 02:40:25,284
[SPEAKER_21]: I drilled myself in the foot.

2053
02:40:25,504 --> 02:40:26,305
[SPEAKER_21]: How did I do that?

2054
02:40:26,505 --> 02:40:27,145
[SPEAKER_21]: I need that.

2055
02:40:29,768 --> 02:40:33,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent answer and a match for AZM Buddy Paul.

2056
02:40:33,471 --> 02:40:34,432
[SPEAKER_08]: I think close enough.

2057
02:40:34,973 --> 02:40:37,435
[SPEAKER_08]: So AZM Buddy Paul on the board with a point.

2058
02:40:37,635 --> 02:40:38,276
[SPEAKER_21]: Play clip now.

2059
02:40:39,196 --> 02:40:40,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Play clip now?

2060
02:40:41,078 --> 02:40:43,200
[SPEAKER_08]: If I can find the clip, I'd be glad to play it.

2061
02:40:43,240 --> 02:40:43,921
[SPEAKER_21]: Play clip for the obvious.

2062
02:40:44,713 --> 02:40:47,775
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm very surprised that I was the only one that went for the obvious one.

2063
02:40:48,415 --> 02:40:49,436
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that was excellent.

2064
02:40:49,476 --> 02:40:50,416
[SPEAKER_08]: You did an excellent job, Jamie.

2065
02:40:50,677 --> 02:40:53,318
[SPEAKER_08]: For those that missed it, you guys, by the way, here you go.

2066
02:40:54,239 --> 02:40:55,980
[SPEAKER_08]: God damn!

2067
02:40:56,960 --> 02:40:57,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Ow, my foot!

2068
02:40:58,361 --> 02:41:00,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

2069
02:41:00,923 --> 02:41:02,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, it hurts so bad!

2070
02:41:02,784 --> 02:41:03,644
[SPEAKER_03]: No, my foot!

2071
02:41:03,744 --> 02:41:04,985
[SPEAKER_03]: I need that for walking!

2072
02:41:10,426 --> 02:41:10,927
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2073
02:41:11,387 --> 02:41:15,830
[SPEAKER_08]: So the score is now two points for Zodiac Knight and one point for AZM Buddy Paul.

2074
02:41:16,571 --> 02:41:18,212
[SPEAKER_21]: I finished the shitty Corona, by the way.

2075
02:41:18,652 --> 02:41:28,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the last question, and it's AZM Buddy Paul's last chance to catch up, or Zodiac Knight's big chance to make this lead even bigger, to cement the win.

2076
02:41:29,300 --> 02:41:29,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

2077
02:41:32,082 --> 02:41:33,343
[SPEAKER_08]: The 23rd Magus.

2078
02:41:34,384 --> 02:41:36,065
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I may have done this question before.

2079
02:41:36,105 --> 02:41:37,206
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll have to stop me if I have.

2080
02:41:38,328 --> 02:41:42,872
[SPEAKER_08]: The 23rd Magus was going to show off his new leet freestyle at the next NorCal tournament.

2081
02:41:44,954 --> 02:41:49,037
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, hey guys, I have this leet new move called the blank.

2082
02:41:55,522 --> 02:42:00,727
[SPEAKER_08]: 23rd Magus was going to show off his new leet freestyle at the next NorCal DDR tournament.

2083
02:42:01,087 --> 02:42:04,510
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, hey guys, I have this new leet move called the blank.

2084
02:42:15,849 --> 02:42:19,331
[SPEAKER_08]: As our celebrities furiously write down their answers as well as the contestants.

2085
02:42:19,351 --> 02:42:28,137
Alright, I'm just waiting on our contestants to send the answers and I think the celebrities are still thinking some of them.

2086
02:42:28,177 --> 02:42:28,677
Yes?

2087
02:42:47,987 --> 02:42:51,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, are celebrities all done with their answers?

2088
02:42:51,889 --> 02:42:52,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's about.

2089
02:42:53,129 --> 02:42:55,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'm just waiting on the contestants here.

2090
02:42:55,270 --> 02:43:15,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'm just waiting on one more contestant here.

2091
02:43:20,601 --> 02:43:21,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, here we go.

2092
02:43:22,922 --> 02:43:23,442
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys ready?

2093
02:43:24,583 --> 02:43:25,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's hear.

2094
02:43:26,964 --> 02:43:30,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear AZM Buddy Paul first, since he's the one that's got to catch up.

2095
02:43:30,625 --> 02:43:35,087
[SPEAKER_08]: 23rd Magus is going to show off his new leet freestyle at the next NorCal DDR tournament.

2096
02:43:35,347 --> 02:43:40,849
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, hey guys, I have this leet new move I call the, AZM Buddy Paul says, blow!

2097
02:43:42,790 --> 02:43:43,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Blow me!

2098
02:43:44,571 --> 02:43:44,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2099
02:43:47,546 --> 02:43:49,146
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Marin's answer in our chat room.

2100
02:43:49,166 --> 02:43:51,067
[SPEAKER_08]: She says, the Portuguese joke book.

2101
02:43:55,788 --> 02:43:56,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

2102
02:43:57,868 --> 02:44:03,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Zodiac Knight says, hey guys, I have this leet new move I call the boo boo kitty fuck.

2103
02:44:04,150 --> 02:44:04,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

2104
02:44:05,210 --> 02:44:05,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

2105
02:44:08,611 --> 02:44:08,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2106
02:44:10,091 --> 02:44:12,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear from the 23rd Magus.

2107
02:44:14,392 --> 02:44:16,613
[SPEAKER_08]: 23rd Magus, you have this leet new move and what do you call it?

2108
02:44:16,673 --> 02:44:16,973
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the

2109
02:44:17,372 --> 02:44:22,616
[SPEAKER_12]: My new move is the met yourself on the bar, curl into a field position, twitch twice, and die.

2110
02:44:24,577 --> 02:44:25,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

2111
02:44:25,958 --> 02:44:26,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

2112
02:44:26,619 --> 02:44:27,199
[SPEAKER_08]: But not a match.

2113
02:44:28,460 --> 02:44:30,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear from Loki.

2114
02:44:30,142 --> 02:44:34,165
[SPEAKER_08]: 23rd Magus has this leet new freestyle called the Dirty Sanchez.

2115
02:44:34,825 --> 02:44:35,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit.

2116
02:44:35,245 --> 02:44:35,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2117
02:44:35,766 --> 02:44:36,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley...

2118
02:44:48,590 --> 02:44:54,233
[SPEAKER_06]: 23rd Magus has this new move and it's called the... Run out the door and spare the people watching move.

2119
02:44:55,774 --> 02:44:57,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Run out the door and spare the people watching move.

2120
02:44:57,395 --> 02:44:58,376
[SPEAKER_21]: I instantly guarantee him a win.

2121
02:44:59,016 --> 02:44:59,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

2122
02:45:00,437 --> 02:45:01,898
[SPEAKER_08]: But not a match.

2123
02:45:03,119 --> 02:45:06,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Close.

2124
02:45:06,181 --> 02:45:11,524
[SPEAKER_08]: 23rd Magus has a new move and I said it's called the white guy being poked with a cattle prod.

2125
02:45:13,826 --> 02:45:15,226
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought that's how he danced anyway.

2126
02:45:15,647 --> 02:45:15,967
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2127
02:45:17,423 --> 02:45:22,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Jamie, 23 Magus has a brand new elite freestyle move, and it's called the... The seppuku.

2128
02:45:22,446 --> 02:45:25,008
[SPEAKER_21]: He joined the suicide circle just to make it work.

2129
02:45:27,089 --> 02:45:29,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Good answer, but not a match.

2130
02:45:29,451 --> 02:45:32,533
[SPEAKER_08]: So, our final score is... Drumroll, please.

2131
02:45:33,913 --> 02:45:36,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Zodiac Knight, with two points, wins!

2132
02:45:37,255 --> 02:45:38,836
[SPEAKER_21]: That's like the most points anyone's ever scored.

2133
02:45:38,856 --> 02:45:40,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Asian Buddy Paul with one point, yeah.

2134
02:45:41,418 --> 02:45:42,959
[SPEAKER_08]: I think two points is like the record.

2135
02:45:43,740 --> 02:45:44,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, what?

2136
02:45:44,864 --> 02:45:45,364
[SPEAKER_08]: What'd you get?

2137
02:45:45,825 --> 02:45:46,165
[SPEAKER_08]: 23rd Magus?

2138
02:45:46,245 --> 02:45:46,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you got two?

2139
02:45:47,105 --> 02:45:50,247
[SPEAKER_08]: So now you tied with 23rd Magus, who played a few weeks ago.

2140
02:45:50,568 --> 02:45:52,169
[SPEAKER_08]: So what does Zodiac Knight get for winning?

2141
02:45:52,449 --> 02:45:53,069
[SPEAKER_20]: Nothing!

2142
02:45:53,329 --> 02:45:54,850
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely nothing.

2143
02:45:56,271 --> 02:45:58,152
[SPEAKER_08]: We get to insult you as the winner.

2144
02:45:59,213 --> 02:46:01,134
[SPEAKER_08]: You could have done better than two points.

2145
02:46:01,474 --> 02:46:02,335
[SPEAKER_08]: You stink.

2146
02:46:02,555 --> 02:46:04,456
[SPEAKER_08]: You're horrible at the money match game.

2147
02:46:05,737 --> 02:46:06,898
[SPEAKER_21]: You win ferret sex.

2148
02:46:07,718 --> 02:46:10,760
[SPEAKER_06]: We give you our everlasting scorn and disdain.

2149
02:46:11,501 --> 02:46:12,061
[SPEAKER_21]: Here's what you win.

2150
02:46:14,278 --> 02:46:14,618
[SPEAKER_21]: I burped.

2151
02:46:14,899 --> 02:46:18,159
[SPEAKER_08]: You win one free coupon, good for going out and getting a life.

2152
02:46:18,179 --> 02:46:19,320
[SPEAKER_21]: You can get him some Suck cookies.

2153
02:46:20,060 --> 02:46:22,781
[SPEAKER_21]: You win the cookies of Suck, except Andrew ate them all.

2154
02:46:22,921 --> 02:46:25,181
[SPEAKER_08]: And what does AZM Buddy Paul win if they run her up?

2155
02:46:26,782 --> 02:46:26,942
[SPEAKER_21]: Air.

2156
02:46:27,622 --> 02:46:31,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you win the air around you to breathe and enjoy.

2157
02:46:31,843 --> 02:46:40,926
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jamie won't come take it away from you, because you know that if you were somebody else, she would run in the room and go, just to take away your air.

2158
02:46:41,877 --> 02:46:43,878
[SPEAKER_08]: So enjoy as the runner-up.

2159
02:46:48,701 --> 02:46:53,324
[SPEAKER_08]: And Zodiac Knight is very happy because he loves ferret sex, and he's very happy he won it.

2160
02:46:55,265 --> 02:46:58,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, thank you guys for playing in tonight's Bomani match game.

2161
02:46:58,087 --> 02:46:58,847
[SPEAKER_08]: That was fun!

2162
02:46:59,267 --> 02:47:00,628
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to do that again sometime.

2163
02:47:01,168 --> 02:47:02,909
[SPEAKER_08]: That's another bit we can drive into the ground.

2164
02:47:03,830 --> 02:47:05,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we're going to take a quick break.

2165
02:47:06,832 --> 02:47:08,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Or we'll take a slow break, I don't know what we're going to do.

2166
02:47:09,352 --> 02:47:12,414
[SPEAKER_08]: But when we come back, we're going to be on our way to wrapping up the show.

2167
02:47:12,774 --> 02:47:15,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we'll do some quick Ask Orange Lounge, if there's anything you guys want to know.

2168
02:47:16,397 --> 02:47:16,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

2169
02:47:17,938 --> 02:47:20,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we'll be talking about some good movies we like or whatever.

2170
02:47:22,521 --> 02:47:24,342
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back in a little bit.

2171
02:47:24,722 --> 02:47:32,568
[SPEAKER_08]: After this, I'm going to play... I'm going to play... I'm going to play Max 300.

2172
02:47:35,009 --> 02:47:37,411
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why, but I feel... Actually, I'm going to play...

2173
02:47:39,670 --> 02:47:40,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm going to play Max 300.

2174
02:47:41,451 --> 02:47:42,132
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you want to hear?

2175
02:47:45,394 --> 02:47:46,475
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that from?

2176
02:47:47,956 --> 02:47:48,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, you know what?

2177
02:47:48,677 --> 02:47:49,998
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have the original soundtrack on my computer.

2178
02:47:50,598 --> 02:47:50,778
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2179
02:47:50,958 --> 02:47:51,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Twinby?

2180
02:47:52,359 --> 02:47:52,960
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do Twinby.

2181
02:47:53,520 --> 02:47:54,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I can play something else from Guitar Freeze for you.

2182
02:47:55,862 --> 02:47:56,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2183
02:47:58,104 --> 02:48:02,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we'll be back after Twin... If I can even find Twinby.

2184
02:48:02,327 --> 02:48:03,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we'll be back after some music.

2185
02:48:08,818 --> 02:48:09,420
Thanks for watching!

2186
02:49:40,304 --> 02:49:41,258
Thanks for watching!

2187
02:51:15,214 --> 02:51:15,855
One, two, three, four!

2188
02:51:15,935 --> 02:51:16,575
One, two, three, four!

2189
02:51:50,238 --> 02:51:51,219
Thanks for watching!

2190
02:52:28,703 --> 02:52:37,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

2191
02:52:37,370 --> 02:52:49,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

2192
02:52:49,960 --> 02:52:53,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2193
02:52:53,662 --> 02:52:56,825
[SPEAKER_08]: What will we learn this week on Ask Orange Lounge?

2194
02:52:57,347 --> 02:52:58,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's the whitest in the room?

2195
02:52:59,068 --> 02:53:00,369
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet you wanted to know.

2196
02:53:01,009 --> 02:53:04,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me tell you, it's Andrew and Baia, long shot.

2197
02:53:06,772 --> 02:53:07,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2198
02:53:08,754 --> 02:53:16,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Our first question for Ask Orange Lounge comes from AZN Buddy Paul, who wants to know, who would Matt do...

2199
02:53:21,581 --> 02:53:27,925
[SPEAKER_08]: If he did lose his big black cock, I'm sorry, what would Matt, not who would, what would Matt do if he lost his big black cock?

2200
02:53:29,426 --> 02:53:30,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, can I answer?

2201
02:53:31,007 --> 02:53:32,508
[SPEAKER_08]: What would you do if you lost your big black cock?

2202
02:53:35,590 --> 02:53:38,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I guess I'd just have to use my reserve big white cock.

2203
02:53:40,273 --> 02:53:41,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, excellent, excellent question.

2204
02:53:43,435 --> 02:53:49,379
[SPEAKER_08]: AsianBuddyPaul would also like to know, would any of the Orange Lounge Radio staff enter Iron Chef?

2205
02:53:50,091 --> 02:53:50,391
[SPEAKER_08]: I would.

2206
02:53:50,731 --> 02:53:51,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, me.

2207
02:53:51,372 --> 02:53:52,512
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be first in line.

2208
02:53:52,552 --> 02:53:53,753
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be fucking great.

2209
02:53:55,313 --> 02:53:57,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Today's secret ingredient is microwave!

2210
02:54:00,436 --> 02:54:03,677
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it tastes really good if you add a nice butter to it, you know.

2211
02:54:04,657 --> 02:54:06,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, I would, yeah, I'd enter.

2212
02:54:06,998 --> 02:54:09,379
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be Iron Chef's superfood, so.

2213
02:54:10,680 --> 02:54:10,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2214
02:54:12,101 --> 02:54:17,243
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, the thing is, though, is that I could probably enter Iron Chef and fake my way through it.

2215
02:54:17,605 --> 02:54:21,088
[SPEAKER_21]: Just because I used to watch all these cooking shows with my grandmother, like the Galloping Gourmet.

2216
02:54:22,649 --> 02:54:29,595
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I can cook really good, I just don't... I'm not saying that I'm as good as those guys, but I'd enter that Iron Chef, just to be funny.

2217
02:54:29,755 --> 02:54:31,876
[SPEAKER_08]: What would be the secret ingredient you'd secretly wish for?

2218
02:54:36,060 --> 02:54:37,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, instant rice.

2219
02:54:39,022 --> 02:54:41,744
[SPEAKER_21]: My secret ingredient would be chicken.

2220
02:54:42,765 --> 02:54:43,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Maren says propel.

2221
02:54:43,706 --> 02:54:45,187
[SPEAKER_21]: Propel.

2222
02:54:45,227 --> 02:54:46,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Cooking with propel.

2223
02:54:46,593 --> 02:54:51,756
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, I bet that berry-flavored papel steamed rice would be good.

2224
02:54:53,937 --> 02:54:54,797
[SPEAKER_21]: Or lemon-flavored.

2225
02:54:55,457 --> 02:54:57,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Next question we have is from, I hope I pronounced this right.

2226
02:54:58,019 --> 02:54:58,819
[SPEAKER_08]: My apologies if I didn't.

2227
02:54:59,379 --> 02:55:02,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Okyun, O-K-Y-U-N, Okyun, Okyun.

2228
02:55:03,301 --> 02:55:05,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Okyun would like to know, how are you?

2229
02:55:07,564 --> 02:55:08,184
[SPEAKER_21]: How and you?

2230
02:55:10,005 --> 02:55:11,846
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm super, thanks for asking.

2231
02:55:12,026 --> 02:55:13,086
[SPEAKER_21]: How am I what?

2232
02:55:14,107 --> 02:55:15,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Just how are you, that's the question.

2233
02:55:15,528 --> 02:55:16,268
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you, Jamie?

2234
02:55:17,500 --> 02:55:20,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, how are you?

2235
02:55:23,905 --> 02:55:25,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody else care to tell how you are?

2236
02:55:26,166 --> 02:55:26,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, how are you?

2237
02:55:30,909 --> 02:55:32,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I don't know.

2238
02:55:32,811 --> 02:55:35,012
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never really tried eating myself.

2239
02:55:35,152 --> 02:55:39,055
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'd be a little bit chewy.

2240
02:55:39,135 --> 02:55:42,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Bit chewy, kind of gristle, you know.

2241
02:55:44,618 --> 02:55:46,780
[SPEAKER_08]: If you marinated me just right, though.

2242
02:55:47,799 --> 02:55:48,660
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be damn good.

2243
02:55:48,700 --> 02:55:50,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Teriyaki me would be good.

2244
02:55:50,381 --> 02:55:53,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I, it was, it was Okion.

2245
02:55:53,644 --> 02:55:54,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Okion.

2246
02:55:54,224 --> 02:55:55,405
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how I'm supposed to pronounce it.

2247
02:55:55,425 --> 02:55:57,787
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever happened to the fava beans and the nice Chianti?

2248
02:56:00,529 --> 02:56:01,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, moving on.

2249
02:56:01,750 --> 02:56:03,031
[SPEAKER_21]: God damn, no movie references.

2250
02:56:03,472 --> 02:56:04,473
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I got the reference.

2251
02:56:05,113 --> 02:56:07,035
[SPEAKER_21]: It puts the lotion on its skin.

2252
02:56:08,556 --> 02:56:09,377
[SPEAKER_21]: My God.

2253
02:56:10,578 --> 02:56:11,298
[SPEAKER_21]: You picked that up.

2254
02:56:14,841 --> 02:56:15,882
[SPEAKER_21]: Can't have been much effort.

2255
02:56:16,402 --> 02:56:17,303
[SPEAKER_10]: You have something you want to say, Jamie?

2256
02:56:19,259 --> 02:56:20,239
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't want to say anything.

2257
02:56:20,319 --> 02:56:21,300
[SPEAKER_21]: Go to the next question.

2258
02:56:21,360 --> 02:56:21,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Next question.

2259
02:56:21,940 --> 02:56:26,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Pip would like to know, wasn't Pip the kid on South Park that was a porn kid?

2260
02:56:27,764 --> 02:56:28,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, I'm Pip.

2261
02:56:29,505 --> 02:56:30,506
[SPEAKER_21]: When do I get to helmet?

2262
02:56:32,247 --> 02:56:36,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do American PS2s not play Japanese DDR games?

2263
02:56:36,690 --> 02:56:38,971
[SPEAKER_21]: What kind of a dumb question is that?

2264
02:56:41,392 --> 02:56:45,295
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to mod my PS2, even if it means I would get the better DDR mixes.

2265
02:56:45,646 --> 02:56:46,967
[SPEAKER_21]: It's country lockout.

2266
02:56:47,127 --> 02:56:48,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's just country lockout.

2267
02:56:48,428 --> 02:56:50,590
[SPEAKER_21]: And they do it for the market.

2268
02:56:50,650 --> 02:56:52,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the question is deeper than it sounds.

2269
02:56:52,551 --> 02:56:55,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Why does Sony feel the need to lock out the PlayStation?

2270
02:56:55,613 --> 02:57:00,597
[SPEAKER_21]: The same way they do for all games and have since the beginning of video game history.

2271
02:57:00,617 --> 02:57:01,938
[SPEAKER_02]: But why should they have to do that?

2272
02:57:03,919 --> 02:57:05,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Why lock us out of the Japanese game?

2273
02:57:05,761 --> 02:57:07,362
[SPEAKER_21]: Market share.

2274
02:57:07,402 --> 02:57:08,683
[SPEAKER_21]: Domestic versus foreign markets.

2275
02:57:08,743 --> 02:57:09,463
[SPEAKER_08]: It's assy.

2276
02:57:09,904 --> 02:57:11,024
[SPEAKER_08]: It's assy and I don't like it.

2277
02:57:11,044 --> 02:57:11,625
[SPEAKER_21]: And copyrights.

2278
02:57:12,686 --> 02:57:12,986
[SPEAKER_21]: You know...

2279
02:57:13,712 --> 02:57:21,535
[SPEAKER_21]: True that with the Nintendo all it was was finding an old copy of Garamite and, you know, putting it on your Game Genie.

2280
02:57:23,796 --> 02:57:29,518
[SPEAKER_21]: But still, you know, they've had lockouts since the, I think the Master System had lockouts because of the PIN cards.

2281
02:57:31,659 --> 02:57:37,762
[SPEAKER_21]: The PC Engine, you can't even find a good converter to play Japanese Hu cards on a TurboGrafx.

2282
02:57:38,562 --> 02:57:41,003
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, however, the games did not have country lockout.

2283
02:57:41,043 --> 02:57:43,284
[SPEAKER_21]: The CDs did not, but it was new technology.

2284
02:57:44,318 --> 02:57:49,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it doesn't really matter anymore anyway, because we do have all these fancy ways of getting around the country lockout.

2285
02:57:49,020 --> 02:57:50,081
[SPEAKER_21]: You know how I got around it?

2286
02:57:50,181 --> 02:57:50,441
[SPEAKER_08]: How?

2287
02:57:50,581 --> 02:57:51,682
[SPEAKER_21]: I bought a JPS2.

2288
02:57:52,722 --> 02:57:54,543
[SPEAKER_08]: I held the shift key while putting in the disc.

2289
02:57:55,964 --> 02:58:09,231
[SPEAKER_21]: Now they have this thing, I think they sell it on NCSX, where you pull the lid, it's like a new case that you put on your PS2, and you can lift the lid off, and you have a card that will stop the game from spinning, and you change out the disc.

2290
02:58:09,331 --> 02:58:09,971
[SPEAKER_21]: It's really stupid.

2291
02:58:10,519 --> 02:58:15,162
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like the old... Remember on the old PlayStation, the multi-swap?

2292
02:58:15,882 --> 02:58:16,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2293
02:58:16,442 --> 02:58:16,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God.

2294
02:58:17,002 --> 02:58:19,604
[SPEAKER_21]: I've seen someone do the seven-point swap.

2295
02:58:20,824 --> 02:58:21,645
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

2296
02:58:21,665 --> 02:58:25,707
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why we had... We bought the last DualShock system that still had the I.O.

2297
02:58:25,727 --> 02:58:28,228
[SPEAKER_21]: port so we could use our GameShark.

2298
02:58:28,388 --> 02:58:28,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Amen.

2299
02:58:29,009 --> 02:58:35,632
[SPEAKER_21]: And we still had the old 101 series, where you know what it took to play import games with that?

2300
02:58:36,052 --> 02:58:36,873
[SPEAKER_21]: A paperclip.

2301
02:58:39,074 --> 02:58:39,334
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2302
02:58:40,490 --> 02:58:42,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on to the next question.

2303
02:58:43,351 --> 02:58:46,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Joe Mama would like to know... Dude, there's a name I haven't heard in a while.

2304
02:58:46,533 --> 02:58:50,934
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, we haven't heard that from that guy in a while, but Joe Mama would like to know... Can I have a dollar?

2305
02:58:51,435 --> 02:58:51,635
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

2306
02:58:52,995 --> 02:58:54,476
[SPEAKER_08]: All your dollars are belong to us.

2307
02:58:54,556 --> 02:58:56,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Bradley would like to say.

2308
02:58:56,797 --> 02:58:58,377
[SPEAKER_08]: You can have a dollar if you give me two dollars first.

2309
02:58:59,958 --> 02:59:00,978
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go, I like that answer.

2310
02:59:00,998 --> 02:59:02,259
[SPEAKER_08]: You can have a dollar when you give me five.

2311
02:59:03,740 --> 02:59:04,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2312
02:59:05,340 --> 02:59:07,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, Zodiac Knight would like to know...

2313
02:59:08,760 --> 02:59:15,704
[SPEAKER_08]: In your opinions, at what point, what number mix, would it be a good time to stop the DDR series?

2314
02:59:15,764 --> 02:59:17,345
[SPEAKER_08]: And Infinity is not an answer.

2315
02:59:18,906 --> 02:59:20,206
[SPEAKER_21]: That was with Max, thank you.

2316
02:59:21,447 --> 02:59:23,088
[SPEAKER_08]: So you think DDR was pretty much dead at 6?

2317
02:59:23,348 --> 02:59:25,229
[SPEAKER_21]: I keep playing it, why not?

2318
02:59:25,609 --> 02:59:27,910
[SPEAKER_21]: But, you know, it's just the same old thing.

2319
02:59:28,070 --> 02:59:31,172
[SPEAKER_21]: There's not really much innovative that they can do with it.

2320
02:59:32,473 --> 02:59:32,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2321
02:59:33,734 --> 02:59:34,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody else care to answer?

2322
02:59:34,414 --> 02:59:36,055
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course, I still think the second mix was the best.

2323
02:59:36,595 --> 02:59:37,716
[SPEAKER_08]: I have an answer, but I'll wait.

2324
02:59:37,916 --> 02:59:38,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Magus?

2325
02:59:42,952 --> 02:59:45,234
[SPEAKER_12]: Take it to 9th, make a final, be done with it.

2326
02:59:45,754 --> 02:59:46,675
[SPEAKER_12]: Make it like Beatmania.

2327
02:59:47,036 --> 02:59:48,597
[SPEAKER_12]: Just take it to 9th, make a final.

2328
02:59:48,717 --> 02:59:48,997
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

2329
02:59:51,439 --> 02:59:52,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, care to comment?

2330
02:59:54,382 --> 02:59:56,003
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll just keep making more.

2331
02:59:56,444 --> 03:00:03,850
[SPEAKER_07]: And be glad it's still around, because then they're not going to make stupid rip-offs like Brittany's Dance Beat the Arcade game or some shit like that.

2332
03:00:05,271 --> 03:00:05,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Ugh...

2333
03:00:06,604 --> 03:00:07,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Barney's Dance Magic.

2334
03:00:08,185 --> 03:00:09,085
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you.

2335
03:00:09,585 --> 03:00:10,566
[SPEAKER_22]: You love me.

2336
03:00:11,206 --> 03:00:14,967
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a drunk inside a suit.

2337
03:00:15,687 --> 03:00:16,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's my thought on it.

2338
03:00:16,548 --> 03:00:18,549
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR should stop at 8th Mix.

2339
03:00:18,909 --> 03:00:20,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Extreme should be the last one.

2340
03:00:20,969 --> 03:00:23,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember how the little thing said... It doesn't make any sense though.

2341
03:00:23,410 --> 03:00:24,631
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so cryptic.

2342
03:00:24,651 --> 03:00:25,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope, this is my thing though.

2343
03:00:27,252 --> 03:00:29,393
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR as we know it should be done.

2344
03:00:29,813 --> 03:00:31,934
[SPEAKER_08]: I want DDR DX now.

2345
03:00:32,054 --> 03:00:33,414
[SPEAKER_08]: I want DDR 2.

2346
03:00:33,834 --> 03:00:35,355
[SPEAKER_08]: I want DDR something new.

2347
03:00:36,144 --> 03:00:37,825
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR, as we know it, is done.

2348
03:00:38,325 --> 03:00:39,466
[SPEAKER_08]: So, forget it.

2349
03:00:39,566 --> 03:00:44,169
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think dancing games by Konami are not done yet.

2350
03:00:44,409 --> 03:00:48,191
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we'll see something new, and it's going to be something competitive.

2351
03:00:48,271 --> 03:00:49,012
[SPEAKER_08]: I always say this.

2352
03:00:49,072 --> 03:00:50,813
[SPEAKER_08]: I say this at least every month on the show.

2353
03:00:51,133 --> 03:00:53,414
[SPEAKER_08]: The next DDR should be something competitive.

2354
03:00:53,875 --> 03:01:00,338
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR has always been a very cooperative game, with some competitive modes, but they haven't been very... Eh, there hasn't been much to them.

2355
03:01:00,719 --> 03:01:04,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Second Mixed Step Battle was maybe the most competitive thing DDR ever had.

2356
03:01:05,017 --> 03:01:34,035
[SPEAKER_08]: and then he had unison mode and then battle mode was like nothing that was just another way of doing versus mode but having like a dance magic competitive mode or something more competitive I think is where DDR should go next but who knows what Konami has an idea of maybe they'll surprise me but please god please no sequels to Dance Dance Dance thank you Justin B would like to know will you play my crappy remix so that people can laugh at it he has a new remix he wants us to play

2357
03:01:34,711 --> 03:01:37,892
[SPEAKER_08]: We're running out of time on the show, but we'll do it in the afterbirth.

2358
03:01:38,132 --> 03:01:39,013
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll all laugh at it.

2359
03:01:40,954 --> 03:01:41,854
[SPEAKER_08]: So stay tuned.

2360
03:01:42,454 --> 03:01:44,715
[SPEAKER_08]: AZM Buddy Paul, and this is the last question of the night.

2361
03:01:44,755 --> 03:01:46,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you all for participating in Ask Orange Lounge.

2362
03:01:47,196 --> 03:01:51,758
[SPEAKER_08]: AZM Buddy Paul would like to know, what do you think about Skye starring in Kill Bill Vol.

2363
03:01:52,018 --> 03:01:51,758
2?

2364
03:01:54,219 --> 03:01:56,800
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that he would probably be the first one killed.

2365
03:01:56,980 --> 03:01:59,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, hey, hey, hey, I don't like that attitude.

2366
03:02:01,331 --> 03:02:02,391
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, though?

2367
03:02:02,751 --> 03:02:03,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Kill Bill Vol.

2368
03:02:03,552 --> 03:02:06,792
[SPEAKER_08]: 2 is already done and shot, so I can't really be in it, unfortunately.

2369
03:02:07,272 --> 03:02:15,994
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would love to be just some guy that has a cameo that decides to purchase the pussy wagon when all is said and done.

2370
03:02:17,495 --> 03:02:18,855
[SPEAKER_08]: The new owner of the pussy wagon.

2371
03:02:20,135 --> 03:02:21,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Loki, you want to answer the question?

2372
03:02:22,116 --> 03:02:23,516
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have just shot her dead.

2373
03:02:23,556 --> 03:02:24,476
[SPEAKER_09]: She has a sword.

2374
03:02:25,897 --> 03:02:27,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you're going to go ninjutsu on me, huh?

2375
03:02:27,717 --> 03:02:27,997
Pfft.

2376
03:02:29,059 --> 03:02:31,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Indiana Jones all over again, bitch.

2377
03:02:32,621 --> 03:02:33,461
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to spoil anything.

2378
03:02:33,482 --> 03:02:34,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to spoil anything.

2379
03:02:34,482 --> 03:02:36,883
[SPEAKER_08]: But I could say something, but I don't want to spoil anything.

2380
03:02:36,903 --> 03:02:37,204
[SPEAKER_08]: I already know.

2381
03:02:37,224 --> 03:02:37,944
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'm thinking.

2382
03:02:38,044 --> 03:02:38,804
[SPEAKER_08]: I already know.

2383
03:02:38,964 --> 03:02:39,625
[SPEAKER_08]: So, ha.

2384
03:02:39,985 --> 03:02:40,245
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2385
03:02:41,206 --> 03:02:41,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2386
03:02:41,886 --> 03:02:42,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2387
03:02:42,747 --> 03:02:43,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2388
03:02:43,267 --> 03:02:46,088
[SPEAKER_08]: So, thank you very much for asking Orange Lounge tonight.

2389
03:02:46,128 --> 03:02:50,491
[SPEAKER_08]: We hope you all learn something, as we do every week on Ask Orange Lounge.

2390
03:02:53,693 --> 03:02:54,613
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't feel like singing.

2391
03:03:06,972 --> 03:03:07,272
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2392
03:03:09,473 --> 03:03:16,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so, well, kids, it's about time for us to wrap up this train wreck of show that we call Orange Lounge Radio.

2393
03:03:17,655 --> 03:03:19,295
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to get everybody's final thoughts.

2394
03:03:19,355 --> 03:03:20,356
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll start with Bradley.

2395
03:03:23,016 --> 03:03:23,897
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope I make it.

2396
03:03:25,057 --> 03:03:26,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I certainly hope I do.

2397
03:03:28,818 --> 03:03:29,618
We hope you make it, too.

2398
03:03:29,638 --> 03:03:29,798
23rd Magus.

2399
03:03:34,926 --> 03:03:35,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Boobies.

2400
03:03:37,347 --> 03:03:39,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Boobies is your final thought.

2401
03:03:39,447 --> 03:03:39,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2402
03:03:39,928 --> 03:03:40,668
[SPEAKER_08]: That's so mature.

2403
03:03:43,669 --> 03:03:45,389
[SPEAKER_08]: You're such a teenage boy.

2404
03:03:46,469 --> 03:03:47,950
[SPEAKER_08]: You are such a teenage boy.

2405
03:03:50,831 --> 03:03:51,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know.

2406
03:03:51,771 --> 03:03:52,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know.

2407
03:03:52,671 --> 03:03:53,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, your final thought.

2408
03:03:54,112 --> 03:03:55,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Toga.

2409
03:03:55,472 --> 03:03:56,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Toga.

2410
03:03:56,772 --> 03:03:57,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Toga.

2411
03:03:58,013 --> 03:03:58,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Toga.

2412
03:04:02,168 --> 03:04:03,610
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is bingo!

2413
03:04:03,670 --> 03:04:06,172
[SPEAKER_21]: Did I take your word out?

2414
03:04:25,363 --> 03:04:26,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hold on.

2415
03:04:26,924 --> 03:04:28,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you have another final thought.

2416
03:04:28,465 --> 03:04:29,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

2417
03:04:29,125 --> 03:04:30,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we'll get to the word in a minute.

2418
03:04:30,406 --> 03:04:31,106
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get to the word in a minute.

2419
03:04:31,126 --> 03:04:34,728
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just wanted to thank everybody for listening to and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2420
03:04:34,768 --> 03:04:35,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Without you, we're nothing.

2421
03:04:35,909 --> 03:04:36,549
[SPEAKER_08]: We're shit.

2422
03:04:36,809 --> 03:04:37,309
[SPEAKER_08]: We suck.

2423
03:04:37,329 --> 03:04:38,190
[SPEAKER_08]: We're scum.

2424
03:04:39,330 --> 03:04:40,491
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we're still great either way.

2425
03:04:42,312 --> 03:04:43,753
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, we do thank you for your support.

2426
03:04:43,953 --> 03:04:46,294
[SPEAKER_08]: And thanks for tuning in as you do every Sunday night.

2427
03:04:47,014 --> 03:04:49,736
[SPEAKER_08]: And take care of yourself and each other.

2428
03:04:50,736 --> 03:04:52,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight's final word goes to Jamie.

2429
03:04:53,458 --> 03:04:54,038
[SPEAKER_13]: Lakata.

2430
03:04:56,118 --> 03:04:58,559
[SPEAKER_08]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2431
03:04:58,979 --> 03:05:02,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

2432
03:05:03,300 --> 03:05:05,160
[SPEAKER_08]: We expect you a nice play again.

2433
03:05:05,640 --> 03:05:08,461
[SPEAKER_10]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2434
03:05:09,161 --> 03:05:16,703
[SPEAKER_05]: As your leader, I encourage you from time to time, and always in a respectful manner, to question my logic.

2435
03:05:17,623 --> 03:05:21,784
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're unconvinced a particular plan of action I've decided is the right one, tell me so.

2436
03:05:22,364 --> 03:05:25,605
[SPEAKER_05]: But allow me to convince you, and I promise you right here and now,

2437
03:05:26,272 --> 03:05:29,835
[SPEAKER_01]: No subject will ever be taboo.

2438
03:05:29,955 --> 03:05:34,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.

2439
03:05:35,720 --> 03:05:43,586
[SPEAKER_05]: The price you pay for bringing up either my Chinese or American heritage as a negative is, I collect your fucking head.

2440
03:05:44,927 --> 03:05:46,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like this fucker here.

2441
03:05:46,768 --> 03:05:48,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if any of you sons of bitches

2442
03:05:51,912 --> 03:05:53,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Got anything else to say?

2443
03:05:54,094 --> 03:05:55,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Now's the fucking time!

2444
03:05:58,840 --> 03:06:04,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't think so.

2445
03:06:06,268 --> 03:06:08,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2446
03:06:38,880 --> 03:06:39,441
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2447
03:06:39,481 --> 03:06:42,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio, to Afterbirth.

2448
03:06:42,983 --> 03:06:45,605
[SPEAKER_08]: So as promised, this week we covered an Ask Orange Lounge.

2449
03:06:45,625 --> 03:06:45,765
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2450
03:06:45,965 --> 03:06:46,345
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2451
03:06:46,505 --> 03:06:46,826
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2452
03:06:47,006 --> 03:06:47,206
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2453
03:06:47,734 --> 03:06:48,995
[SPEAKER_21]: Can I collect your fucking head?

2454
03:06:49,156 --> 03:06:50,978
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you may not collect my fucking head.

2455
03:06:53,500 --> 03:06:58,005
[SPEAKER_08]: We kind of have to make this a quick afterbirth because we're running to the movie theater to go see Kill Bill for the second time.

2456
03:06:58,245 --> 03:06:59,587
[SPEAKER_08]: For Magus' case, the first time.

2457
03:07:00,948 --> 03:07:01,769
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a Kill Bill virgin.

2458
03:07:02,049 --> 03:07:04,650
[SPEAKER_08]: I encourage you, by the way, to see Kill Bill as many times as you can at the theater.

2459
03:07:05,010 --> 03:07:06,391
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this should be the new cult movie.

2460
03:07:06,892 --> 03:07:09,433
[SPEAKER_08]: This should be like the Rocky Horror Picture Show Part 2 or something.

2461
03:07:09,453 --> 03:07:10,994
[SPEAKER_21]: Wouldn't this be fun to shadow cast?

2462
03:07:11,134 --> 03:07:11,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God.

2463
03:07:12,095 --> 03:07:14,716
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd so be like a member of the 88 Gang.

2464
03:07:15,737 --> 03:07:18,478
[SPEAKER_21]: I would, of course, have to take Go-Go's character.

2465
03:07:19,119 --> 03:07:19,399
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2466
03:07:21,380 --> 03:07:21,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

2467
03:07:22,140 --> 03:07:30,065
[SPEAKER_08]: This is from our very own Justin B. We play things that our chat room builds because we support our chat room just like they support us.

2468
03:07:30,846 --> 03:07:31,747
[SPEAKER_08]: The Speedy Mix by Justin B

2469
03:08:17,819 --> 03:08:19,139
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S S S S S S S S S

2470
03:08:59,761 --> 03:09:00,543
Thanks for watching!

2471
03:09:58,099 --> 03:10:00,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we need to laugh at it now.

2472
03:10:01,902 --> 03:10:05,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha ha ha ha remix, ha ha ha speedy mix, ha ha.

2473
03:10:06,325 --> 03:10:10,528
[SPEAKER_21]: And if Foss hasn't seen Kill Bill by the time we go to Alabama, I'll pay to for her to see it.

2474
03:10:12,670 --> 03:10:14,291
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course, I can just upload it to her.

2475
03:10:15,875 --> 03:10:18,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we don't endorse piracy here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2476
03:10:18,757 --> 03:10:20,298
[SPEAKER_08]: We endorse it.

2477
03:10:21,019 --> 03:10:27,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I don't really have anything interesting to say in the afterbirth tonight.

2478
03:10:28,403 --> 03:10:29,364
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I have a headache.

2479
03:10:29,884 --> 03:10:31,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're just all in a mad kind of mood.

2480
03:10:32,206 --> 03:10:33,727
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all in a pissy mood, remember?

2481
03:10:35,728 --> 03:10:37,949
[SPEAKER_08]: What I feel Orange Lounge vocal edit, I don't remember.

2482
03:10:38,029 --> 03:10:40,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, was that the one where I was going, I feel, or who was it?

2483
03:10:40,911 --> 03:10:41,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it Loki?

2484
03:10:42,352 --> 03:10:42,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

2485
03:10:42,632 --> 03:10:44,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually that's my thing, but yeah, Loki does it sometimes too.

2486
03:10:45,959 --> 03:10:46,319
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

2487
03:10:47,520 --> 03:10:49,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Is Loki going to do an Orange Lounge Christmas album?

2488
03:10:49,761 --> 03:10:50,121
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

2489
03:10:53,423 --> 03:10:59,345
[SPEAKER_08]: It's beginning to look like Christmas.

2490
03:11:00,626 --> 03:11:06,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody in our chat room, I think it was Project DDR USA 2, I think, was making the Strong Bad skin for Step Mania.

2491
03:11:07,429 --> 03:11:08,269
[SPEAKER_08]: That should be a riot.

2492
03:11:09,210 --> 03:11:10,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, was it BRP Ohio?

2493
03:11:10,951 --> 03:11:11,311
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

2494
03:11:13,452 --> 03:11:14,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my bad.

2495
03:11:16,522 --> 03:11:17,042
You're a beast!

2496
03:11:45,974 --> 03:11:46,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Eurobeat?

2497
03:11:46,775 --> 03:11:47,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2498
03:11:47,235 --> 03:11:49,517
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I have any Eurobeat albums, really.

2499
03:11:51,858 --> 03:11:54,961
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't you have my CD with the 614 megabytes of Eurobeat?

2500
03:11:54,981 --> 03:11:55,881
[SPEAKER_21]: Ooh, I do.

2501
03:11:56,042 --> 03:11:56,402
[SPEAKER_08]: I do.

2502
03:11:56,542 --> 03:11:56,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Somewhere.

2503
03:11:57,242 --> 03:11:57,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, I'll find it.

2504
03:11:57,943 --> 03:11:59,444
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to fill time while I find it, though.

2505
03:11:59,784 --> 03:12:00,145
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2506
03:12:00,925 --> 03:12:03,327
[SPEAKER_21]: Because, you know, I was supposed to do a Eurobeat marathon, and I didn't.

2507
03:12:04,007 --> 03:12:05,488
[SPEAKER_21]: Damn, I feel so bad.

2508
03:12:05,869 --> 03:12:07,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody alert Nostalin.

2509
03:12:07,330 --> 03:12:08,731
[SPEAKER_21]: I played Happy Hardcore instead.

2510
03:12:09,471 --> 03:12:11,713
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it was, like, Volume 7 of Happy to be Hardcore.

2511
03:12:13,815 --> 03:12:15,616
[SPEAKER_21]: I need to, like, go back and get the others.

2512
03:12:18,181 --> 03:12:19,742
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think you'll get that CD when you're done with it.

2513
03:12:19,782 --> 03:12:22,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody alert Nostylan that we're going to do a Eurobeat marathon.

2514
03:12:22,584 --> 03:12:27,289
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, make sure that he's got a change of underwear handy or something.

2515
03:12:28,490 --> 03:12:30,371
[SPEAKER_21]: Because he's probably going to go through about five of them.

2516
03:12:34,495 --> 03:12:34,695
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2517
03:12:34,715 --> 03:12:36,437
[SPEAKER_08]: The room's already excited about this one.
