00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,620
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

7
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,280
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

8
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,200

This is a tasty burger.

17
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,280
Look you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.

18
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,280
It's a house? Look!

19
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,280
It's a flesh wound.

20
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,280
Searching for a boy in high school isn't useless.

21
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,280
It's searching for meaning in a polished genre.

22
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,280
Oh yeah?

23
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,280
Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

24
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Dark Sakura.

00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Sky.

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,280

Gonna take a time to find the lack of system

64
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,160
Now and there, verse attachment

65
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,660
This thing needs a black-and-all way

66
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,660
To put a trigger test above the paint, how do you do today?

67
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,160
Don't get me wrong, I'm a bachelor fist

68
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,660
The mind can't do more than fist

69
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,160
Expose concern on what it takes

70
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,160
You know that terrorists always make these mistakes

71
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,660
What we got is a slow momentum

72
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,160
If you need the right tools and fences

73
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,660
Try the wave, can't count for the rhythm

74
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,160
The marks, the teachers, we gotta get with it

75
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,660
The rain is a generate almighty

76
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
For we need to do it higher, master's man, go slower

77
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,660
Yeah, don't really think that far. It's up to you to make that call to drop the bomb.

78
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,660
Yeah, drop the bomb.

79
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,660
Drop the bomb.

80
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,660
Let me see that bomb.

81
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,660
You're still looking for a way that's never been seen before.

82
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,660
Gotta think about what's now to come.

83
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,660
Drop the bomb.

84
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,660
Drop the bomb.

85
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:52,660
What we gotta do is build momentum, if you need the right tools and venting.

86
00:08:52,660 --> 00:09:01,660
Ride the waves, I'm comfy, the rhythm's the march, the future's begun, get with it.

87
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,660
You're ready to stare at almighty, if I were you to do it now, you're much the same, go slower.

88
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,660
Yeah, you're so ready to take that fall, and it's up to you to make that call.

89
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:14,160
And if you don't run, make sure you don't bang and wipe it out.

90
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,160
You got the ball

91
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,160
You got the ball

92
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
You got the ball

93
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:29,660
You got the ball

94
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,160
then you got the ball

95
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,160
that ball

96
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,160
You

97
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:35,160
I'm gonna be your fantasy, it's me I'm gonna be your fantasy, I'm gonna be your fantasy

98
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,780
Your fantasy sticks me ecstasy

99
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:34,160
Mr. Random person on the street, who by the way is not an actor, what do you think of

100
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:44,000
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

101
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's unearthly.

102
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,280
It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

103
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,640
Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

104
00:11:53,640 --> 00:12:00,120
Hope you enjoyed the oon, oon, oon, duh, duh, duh, twa, twa, twa, and dropped the bomb

105
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,900
long mix.

106
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,540
The V-Rare album, the brand new one that just came out with DDR Extreme in Japan.

107
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,420
I think you broke the camera with that cookie.

108
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:07,920
Shut up.

109
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:14,700
If you're wondering what happened to the Orange Lounge Radio DDR Extreme premiere show,

110
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,140
well, I ordered my copy of Extreme a little later than some of you,

111
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,860
and therefore we won't be getting it until Tuesday.

112
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,140
I had forgot to order mine.

113
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,380
So we won't be doing the show until Wednesday.

114
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,020
Oops, because I'm going to Alabama.

115
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,520
Yeah.

116
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,220
Wait, when do you leave for Alabama?

117
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,260
Next month.

118
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:29,760
Next month.

119
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,860
We're still a little ways away.

120
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,860
We just did the math though and you're going to be missing episode 69, which makes me cry.

121
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,860
Unless you put us on hiatus.

122
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,860
Put the show on hiatus? Never.

123
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,860
Hey, we want to go to Gotham Land on Sunday.

124
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,860
Well, let's just re-record the show.

125
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,860
No, we don't put the show on hiatus.

126
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,860
Remember those days.

127
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,860
I will take my replacement.

128
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,860
Oh, you're going to hand pick a replacement.

129
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,860
I will take my replacement.

130
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,860
Just be gentle when you're picking.

131
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,860
Just be gentle while you're picking.

132
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,860
Yeah, right.

133
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,860
I'll break out the asbestos gloves.

134
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,860
Yes, I originally had told our chat room earlier in the week.

135
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,860
For those of you guys that lurk in our chat room 24-7,

136
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,860
Get a life! No, just kidding. Just kidding. We love it.

137
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,860
I did say originally Monday because I thought that's what day I was going to get it,

138
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,860
but I actually checked the UPS thing and it's not going to get here until Tuesday

139
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,460
PS is slower than I remember and it takes two days to get here not one so

140
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,060
we are actually gonna be getting on Tuesday but because Jamie show we're not

141
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,540
gonna play until Wednesday so that's when the DDR extreme premiere show will

142
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,860
be will be Wednesday not much of a premiere I know because many of you

143
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,580
have already played it but I know a lot of you guys don't have access to a

144
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,860
Japanese PlayStation twos and maybe you're a little curious about the game

145
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,020
because details have been a little details about the new DDR extreme you

146
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,140
know all the stuff we really want to know about is come out what are they

147
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,580
hidden songs. What do they sound like? What are the non stop courses? They are little

148
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:04,000
things haven't really been talked about. So we'll be doing that on our webcam as well.

149
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,180
We have the TV hooked up to the webcam. The little things, the cool things, the information

150
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,180
mode things that we can't read, but will be funny anyway, I'm sure.

151
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,020
Yay. You're supposed to promote the program.

152
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:26,020
Yay. I'm excited. I was poor earlier. I'm ordering my next week because I had to buy

153
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:31,700
a ticket to see Alan Jackson. Why are you buying a ticket willingly to go to a country

154
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:38,320
concert? Because my mom wants to go. That's like when I was going to buy my mom a ticket

155
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,080
to see Celine Dion in Vegas. But then I realized I don't want to contribute to that. Your mom

156
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:50,160
likes Celine Dion. Yeah, my mom loves Celine Dion. You know who else my mom likes? A lot?

157
00:14:50,160 --> 00:15:02,780
Barbra Streisand. And my mom also bought the Rosie O'Donnell Christmas album.

158
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:09,580
But Celine Dion can't sing for shit. The only good song she did was by Meat Loaf.

159
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,160
Yeah Meat Loaf is cool. Yeah he was Eddie.

160
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,980
I see Marin is in our chat room and she's going to Alabama with you and she says I don't

161
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:24,980
I'll make you go. I'll buy your damn ticket. Just watch. You're coming to see Alan Jackson

162
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,860
Biloxi with us. I'm probably going to leave her over at Mama Sun's.

163
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:40,380
Haha, you opened your mouth. Anyway, usually at the top of the show we talk about how was

164
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:47,660
your day, how was your week, but today I wanted to be a little different.

165
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,660
Let's talk about Orange Lounge Radio Goes to the Movies.

166
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,660
Yay!

167
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,500
Because, while we didn't all go to the movies together this week, in fact, the three of

168
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,840
us went to three separate shows across the weekend.

169
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,180
We all saw the same movie.

170
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,900
And what movie did we see, Jamie?

171
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,900
Kill Bill.

172
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,500
Yes, we saw Kill Bill volume one.

173
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Best movie ever.

174
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,660
So, Jamie, would you like to start with your review of Kill Bill?

175
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,660
Blood!

176
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,380
Remember, we have to keep it spoiler free because we have somebody in the room who hasn't

177
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,740
seen it, for one, and we don't know, our listeners probably haven't seen it, although they should.

178
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:26,860
It's different blood effects of various types, whether it be CG or liquid, blood in various

179
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:32,940
colors, oh no CG, but there's still various different types of blood effects, like everything

180
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:44,700
from the squirt to the splatter to the animated to the blood. It was blood. Lots, lots, lots,

181
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:50,460
lots of it. Most of the movie was in Japanese. There were puns in the movie. If you don't

182
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:55,000
really understand Japanese, then you won't get them. I was there laughing in the theater

183
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,140
and people were giving me weird looks. That was great. Then the people in the theater

184
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:06,420
were funny too. I'm not going to say what the scene was, but there was this one particular

185
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:11,560
really awesome scene and it gets really quiet and this guy's back is like, whoa, and everybody

186
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:24,560
busted out. And the whole movie was just fantastic. On a scale of one to ten? Five thousand million.

187
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:30,440
Which is just one point short of Battle Royale.

188
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,320
Loki what did you think of Kill Bill Volume 1?

189
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,500
I already knew it was going to be good, I already read the script beforehand.

190
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,500
You little pirate.

191
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Arrr.

192
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,500
I didn't pirate the script, it was online.

193
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Whatever.

194
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,520
So how can I be a pirate if it was readily available online?

195
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,600
Was it readily available from Miramax, did Miramax distribute the script or did some

196
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,880
little kid find it and put it out for everybody to download?

197
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Just because it's on the internet doesn't mean it's legal.

198
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
I don't know.

199
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,880
It was at moviesource.com.

200
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,880
Anyways, it was good. I liked it. It was everything I thought it was going to be.

201
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,880
On a scale of one to ten?

202
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,880
Oh, that was good. Ten is Oscar material.

203
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,880
I'm sorry. I don't see that ever happening.

204
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,880
Oh, come on. Pulp Fiction.

205
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:51,680
I think Pulp Fiction has the F-word in it 256 times, and this movie had it maybe...

206
00:18:51,680 --> 00:19:09,600
40. Just because there's not blood. That was a pair of the suckiest throws ever. By the

207
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:17,400
way, there are two tie-ins, by the way, to Battle Royale, not just one, other than, what

208
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:24,640
was her name, Kuriyama Chiaki. The chick who plays Chinguisa. You're saying Linguisa, which

209
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,480
is a talent. Chigusa. That's it, sorry. Yes, that's her, but there's another one. In the

210
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,780
animated sequence, the girl's voice actor is Maeda Ai, who played the girl at the very

211
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,320
beginning of Battle Royale with the blood all over her face. Oh, cool. And who is in

212
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
battle royale too.

213
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,320
Very cool.

214
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:53,080
For other anime fans, Midori Kala is in it, you can tell him by his nasally ass voice.

215
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,320
There is an anime sequence, probably about ten minutes long, some of the folks say Ghost

216
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,320
in the Shell, right?

217
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:08,580
Yeah, it was done by Studio Gonzo.

218
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:14,420
My review of Kill Bill was, it was, okay this is the interesting thing because every geek

219
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,480
I know just totally fucking loved this movie.

220
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,060
Like I've been reading Live Journal over the weekend and stuff and all my geek friends

221
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,580
who saw it was like, this is the coolest movie ever.

222
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,660
Because it's an homage, it pays homage to everything geek.

223
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,760
It is just like a tribute to everything geek.

224
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,340
Like it is, and this is the thing is that Tarantino is a fan of like everything that

225
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,940
we talk about on this show.

226
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,260
when I was watching the movie I knew Jamie was just gonna be wet watching

227
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:45,340
this movie because I could see all these influences from like all of her favorite

228
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,020
things that she never shuts up about like battle royale and the anime and all

229
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,180
that stuff so I just was like oh Jamie's gonna be loving this when she sees it

230
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,580
and I really loved it too because I like all that stuff too and and the blood was

231
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:01,780
great and what

232
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:09,620
I'm just faking. Yeah, I was just thinking that too. That was one of the best, I don't

233
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:14,780
want to spoil it, but that was the best thing in the whole movie. And the pussy wagon. The

234
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:19,080
pussy wagon. Okay, that's it, that's it. I won't say anything else. On a scale of one

235
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:29,780
to ten, what? On a scale of one to ten, I give it a ten point one. I win. Fifteen million.

236
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,780
Does Bradley have anything you want to say about Kill Bill?

237
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,780
Yes, it was cool. I enjoyed it.

238
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,780
I don't know, I can't really add anything because people say it the most.

239
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,780
I was kind of sitting there.

240
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,780
So I gave it a 10 because it was really cool.

241
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,780
Andrew, I know you haven't seen it, but what would you give it on a scale of 1 to 10?

242
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,780
Based on what Jamie goes...

243
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,580
million and if everyone in this room gives me a dollar I can go see it how

244
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,820
about no but you know what boo we'll give you those sucky cookies to sell on

245
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,100

249
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,780

250
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:45,980
Fulton or something oh well we'll figure something out maybe later you wanna go do you wanna go after

251
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,460
the show okay I have to see it three more times okay we'll go see it you know I only saw Freddy

252
00:22:50,460 --> 00:23:04,640
If I really like a movie, then, see, four is my favorite number.

253
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,640
Okay.

254
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,360
This is where my small bit of obsessive compulsive disorder sneaks in.

255
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,600
If I really like a movie, I either have to see it twice or four times in a theater.

256
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,800
If I really dig the movie, it's four times.

257
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,160
How many times did I see Harry Potter?

258
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,160
Four times.

259
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,160
And you were there for one of them.

260
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,340
for one of them. I was there for number two, I think. No, it doesn't, number three. Oh,

261
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,380
was it number three? You were there for number three. That's good, because I don't like being

262
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:32,620
number two. But I have to, if I really like a movie, then I go see it multiple times.

263
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:38,740
But then again, I've already seen it twice. You know what I'm thinking? The most number

264
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,900
of times, not counting Rocky Horror Picture Show, that's an exception obviously, but not

265
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,140
counting Rocky Horror Picture Show, the most number of times I've seen a movie in the theater

266
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:53,280
is three. I saw Titanic three times in the theater. Dork. Just don't ask. I got dragged

267
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,320
by different people. I saw Shakespeare in Love three times in the theater. I think I

268
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:05,020
need to see Kill Bill four times. This started back with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

269
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,880
movie. Which I've seen in the theater four times. Did you see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

270
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:16,560
two The Secret of the Ooze four times? I saw it twice. I saw the third one twice as well.

271
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,640
The third one was cool. The third one was just neat. The third one was cool. Shut up.

272
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:30,240
I've seen Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey four times in the theater. I've seen Harry Potter

273
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,800
and Chamber of Secrets four times in the theater. I wasn't into Harry Potter when the first

274
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:41,800
movie came out. I've seen Freddy vs. Jason twice. I've seen, there was one movie I saw

275
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,600
six times in the theater and I forgot what it was just because I kept having to go with

276
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:53,040
people and I didn't like the movie but that doesn't fall into my rating system. Titanic.

277
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,680
I've seen The Matrix twice in the theater. Well, anyway, I thought we could all give

278
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:04,360
our little review on it. Andrew, just go with us. We'll cover you somehow. I'll help you.

279
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:11,440
take pity on your poor pathetic soul. You can get into an R rated movie all by yourself

280
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:21,040
now, huh? Yay! How does it feel to be a big boy? Andrew will you stand up and pose on

281
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:26,000
our webcam real fast? I want to read your shirt. I swear it is like reading a novel

282
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,320
right here. Stan, you don't read many books, do you? Shut up. I'm going to read this for

283
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,080
you guys who can't see it on the cam because it's kind of blurry. It says, Mom, Dad, I'm

284
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,200
so sorry. I know you told me not to have anybody in the house while you were away, but when

285
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,220
my friends stopped by, I had to let them in. It wasn't planned or anything. I certainly

286
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:48,440
wouldn't call it a party. Honestly, I have no idea how the band got here or why the police

287
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,560
were called. I'm really, really sorry about the house, but that's why we have insurance,

288
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,560
How many times do you get stopped so people can read that shirt?

289
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,560
More times when people stop to talk to me.

290
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,560
Is that your way of getting attention?

291
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,560
We need to get him the shirt that you got me.

292
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,560
I hate my life.

293
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,560
Every day I polish my revolver and I shoot my head like a rock star.

294
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,840
This 80 year old lady stopped me in the grocery store to read my shirt and said it was the

295
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:27,400
funniest thing she's ever seen in her life.

296
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,600
That that.

297
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:36,000
And then while the rest of us are at Scandia lamenting it.

298
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,880
Evil place.

299
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,480
Why should we go to ARC for DDR?

300
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,080
You're like one of the only people that sticks up for this little community college with

301
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,660
DDR machine and I have no interest in going to college to play DDR but I'm

302
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,680
curious to hear why you love it so much. It's cheap, it's loud, they've got all the

303
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,900
unlocks, it's in perfect condition, they keep it in perfect condition. If it isn't

304
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:03,240
in perfect condition I damn well beat their asses for it. Like okay somebody

305
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,520
fix it had now. You know what they need to do? They need to put DDR machines next to

306
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:13,580
military drafting boards you know just like that would be the ultimate

307
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:20,400
ultimate military idea. Why? Get stupid nerdy people in there, trick them into going there

308
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:30,020
and then they're in the military. You're going to basic trick maniac them into the military.

309
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:35,100
That was really dumb, really dumb. I just brought this show to a screeching halt, amazing.

310
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:40,060
You know, I'm sure you would probably say that you pulled a magus, but I can't do that.

311
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:45,180
it would sound better in portuguese especially since someone took your toilet your i'm sorry

312
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:51,180
your joke book so that they could wipe their ass if anyone's been keeping up with my board hello

313
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:57,580
would you like to give your board a plug yes it needs to be plugged into a wall to have some life

314
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:03,180
in it i posted on your board this week yeah and the puzzle pirate said that nobody reads

315
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,180
Hey, I read it and

316
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:09,460
It's real play that dark Sakura calm. There's no www in front of it

317
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:13,680
So don't be stupid and put it in front of there. Just real play dark Sakura calm

318
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,100
It's that easy sign up for it become one with the nerdiness

319
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,860
All right, let's move into how was your week

320
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,820
How was your day because I want to hear how you guys this week in your day was so Jamie. How was your week?

321
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,820
How was your day week sucked?

322
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:37,180
I had like a really bad night within the week, which was alleviated by some strategically

323
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:43,540
IM'd cat pictures.

324
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,380
I was just really kind of crappy all week.

325
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,060
I had a really good day Friday, and then I was really disappointed because Dan's like,

326
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:56,740
I don't want to go to the movie, so I was like, well fine.

327
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,860
Basically what happened Friday, okay last week was customer service week all week which

328
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:06,100
is kind of neat and Thursday was what is your favorite decade day so I dressed all 80s it

329
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:12,220
was great and played Duran Duran in my cubicle all day.

330
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:20,860
And then Thursday, not Thursday but Friday, they fed us spaghetti.

331
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,500
My supervisor cooked it and she makes really good spaghetti.

332
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,180
And then I get home and I'm like, okay, Dan, we're gonna go see Kill Bill, right?

333
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,020
And he's like, uh, I cooked you dinner.

334
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,780
Oh, how nice.

335
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,620
He cooked spaghetti.

336
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,900
So that's spaghetti twice.

337
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:42,900
And so I, I, you know, I went to the, to the store and bought like some garlic

338
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,660
bread and some real Parmesan cheese.

339
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,140
So it made it better.

340
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,340
You don't like the powder Parmesan cheese.

341
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,220
You have to have the actual,

342
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,060
Now that since I've had real Parmesan cheese, I have to have

343
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:57,420
real parmesan cheese every time and I'm such a snob when it comes to what I put

344
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:04,260
on my food but only half my cheese elitist bite my ass I'll show you cheese

345
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:12,540
anyway I you know I would have eat I would not have eaten that cookie if I

346
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:18,820
had known what it was to begin with that cookie deceived me that cookie is can

347
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,020
you can you provide our listeners with a little bit of backstory on the cookies

348
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:59,700
are turning purple. Anyway, don't you see, you're getting retarded. I love you, you love

349
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:16,700
me. There's nothing to throw, finish your story. No, do not throw the cookie you suck.

350
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:45,440
We get to the checkout counter at Walmart and I am delighted and thrilled to see oatmeal

351
00:31:45,440 --> 00:32:04,280
cream cookies on the little Debbie Snack Bar.

352
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:09,520
I grabbed the box, and I hugged the box as excited as I am, and I freakin'...

353
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,520
She did.

354
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
I was there.

355
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,520
I fucked...

356
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,520
I fucked...

357
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,520
You fucked the box.

358
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,760
I forked over the money for this...

359
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,960
You're eating bacon bits out of the box?

360
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,960
My God.

361
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,960
No, you're sorry.

362
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,600
Anyway, I forked over the money to get this thing of oatmeal cream pie thing.

363
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
Get in the car.

364
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,600
I'm halfway through the cookie, mind you.

365
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:40,220
these things are too chewy these things suck I can't taste the cream oh my god

366
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,600
it's marshmallow ew and then we look at the box and reduce fat and I'm like oh

367
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:52,280
well shit so I gave one to I had Rob eat one and Rob agrees with me that they're

368
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:57,860
the worst cookies ever right sucks so we decided that we were going to come back

369
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:04,860
make everybody else eat them. And we've been successful so far.

370
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:10,060
This reminds me, there's one part in Kill Bill where there's a cereal box called Kaboom.

371
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:16,060
I remembered it from when I was like 5 to 10 years old.

372
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,060
I know. I hated that cereal.

373
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:24,740
We grabbed it one day and it was the worst cereal I've ever tasted. So we took one bite

374
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:31,580
and we basically threw out the box and that was the throwback.

375
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:37,100
They need to make shirts with old cereal boxes on them like Mr. T cereal.

376
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:43,620
I want a shirt with Mr. T cereal on the front or the Nintendo Breakfast System.

377
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:51,540
Like, it's for breakfast now.

378
00:33:51,540 --> 00:34:07,500
is it I feel really old yeah you were still it was earlier than that okay

379
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:16,140
anyway nobody can hear what you're saying anyway so shut up anyway as you

380
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:20,980
know what I've noticed so many things from when I was younger are making a big

381
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:26,620
comeback now you know like you know they're doing all the re-releases of

382
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:32,540
Transformers. I have my season 3 box set now and so in the first half of it I

383
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:37,620
watched the worst episode of Transformers in history next to carnage

384
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:42,380
in C minor or major whatever it was. You know what? It's the Starscream Ghost episode for

385
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,840
season 3 and it's the worst episode ever. You said everything from your youth is

386
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:50,140
making a comeback right that's because they say like things cycle in 20 year

387
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:54,020
cycles like in the 80s 60s things were popular again and here we are in the

388
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:58,900
year 2000 and the 80s stuff is making a comeback because it's 20 years ago so

389
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,180
like all the stuff my child has been you come back just think in 20 years DDR is

390
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:10,780

391
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:19,740

392
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:26,420

393
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:30,140
in Japan now I think so yeah

394
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,140
I have spirits.

395
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,140
You know, it got quiet.

396
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,140
Well, are you done with your story?

397
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,140
I was telling a story.

398
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,140
Oops.

399
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,140
I got sidetracked, sorry.

400
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,140
It's alright.

401
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,140
That happens all the time.

402
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,140
Whose turn is it?

403
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,140
Uh, Loki's.

404
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,140
Here you go, bacon breath.

405
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,140
Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

406
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,140
Almost bacon breath.

407
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,140
Good.

408
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,140
It was a bacon breath.

409
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:07,140
Yeah, Bake O'Breath. My week was good. I finished both DDR pads. They're done. Thank God. I'm so glad to be done with those.

410
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:26,620
And so I finished those. I had to kind of actually, they were finished last night very late. I had to do a really ghetto job on one of the panels because I lost one of the corner pieces somehow. And so there's a nice little square metal piece holding one of the panels. And I see it.

411
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:33,620
it's a square mending bracket but anyways I started this morning or

412
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:39,900
afternoon I started my cabinet so by estimates it shouldn't take too long to

413
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,580
do probably about a week or two and it'll be done because I'm already you

414
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:51,660
know almost finished drawing up the first the first the hell

415
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,180
yeah

416
00:36:55,180 --> 00:37:06,180
Okay, anyways, um, yeah, I'm almost done drawing up the first, um, whole, uh, sheet of, um, particle board.

417
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,180
And there's actually only three that make up the cabinet, so, yeah, hey!

418
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,180
One sixth of the way done, so, yay!

419
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,180
And that would only take a couple hours.

420
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:20,180
So, um, probably shouldn't take too long, and we'll be having a arcade cabinet where the TV is now.

421
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,180
Enjoy!

422
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:26,180
Hey, don't be knocking it, you know you'll enjoy it.

423
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:30,180
Fucking break out the old school games and stuff.

424
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:35,180
Anyway, then yesterday we went down the golf land and played a bunch of F-Zero because there's no one playing it.

425
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:41,180
And there was a bunch of other people playing DDR and some retard unplugged the machine when we were trying to play it.

426
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,180
Fuckers.

427
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,180
What else? Oh, not too much.

428
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,180
I hear Drummania is broken again.

429
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,180
Actually, it was.

430
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:57,180
It was in police call attendant mode, so as soon as Keith gets back there on Monday, I'll be fine again.

431
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,180
Then what else?

432
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:02,180
Oh, during the week sucked and didn't do a whole lot other than see Kill Bill.

433
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,180
That was cool.

434
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,180
Yeah, that's it.

435
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:10,180
Not too much.

436
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:15,180
Okay, let's talk to Andrew.

437
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,180
Andrew, how was your week? How was your day?

438
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,180
Weak, exhausting. Day to suck.

439
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:29,180
Just day after day after day of college, which is absolutely tiring.

440
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:34,180
And we'll get to that in a little bit in the FUs.

441
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,180
Today I just sat around, played Ragnarok.

442
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,180
Actually leveled a couple of times, which is getting harder and harder, but...

443
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:57,500
figure it all balances out. That's about it. I just got bored and decided to come here.

444
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,300
You know, I've actually considered getting back into Ragnarok lately, but I decided to

445
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:06,500
start Final Fantasy X again. No, Ragnarok.

446
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,420
Not until I finish Final Fantasy X. I'll tank your alkaline. Play Ragnarok.

447
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:16,580
wait are you on are you on uh loki server i play on all three servers

448
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:24,180

449
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:34,820

450
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:39,380
started final fantasy 10 some time ago like about a year and a half no it was about a year ago

451
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:44,660
was when I was with my ex, it was a year ago, and I started it and I never finished it.

452
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:48,620
I only got about 10 hours into it, and so last week after the show, I picked it up again

453
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:52,680
and I said, I'm bored, I need something to do. So I'm like, okay, I'm going to play Final

454
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,060
Fantasy X, I'm going to play it, I'm going to beat it. I need to restart the international

455
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:01,780
one. And in this one week, I'm already past where I was last time. I just got past that

456
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:06,300
point today. You want to know what's going to be scary? The international version is

457
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:14,820
easier so if I get started playing I'll catch up to you yes I know Final Fantasy

458
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:21,500
10 is so 2002 so what I'm a late bloomer I'm retro and you know what on with

459
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:28,060
Final Fantasy 10 to coming out pretty soon you know it'll it means the story

460
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,940
will be fresh in my mind ever been to the GameStop and Arden from all that was

461
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:41,700
my DVD in the machine. Remember that crappy DVD I picked up last time you were here? That's

462
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,940
the DVD that's been selling all the pre-orders at Arden-Ferrall.

463
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:51,180
Yeah, that's cool. Whatever works. Yeah, so my DVD, my piece of shit DVD went

464
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:55,580
to a good use. Good deal. Let's hear from Bradley. How was

465
00:40:55,580 --> 00:41:01,780
your day? How was your week? Well, most of my week was spent looking at

466
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:08,420
for a job type thing, working on my cover letter and trying a few things and waiting

467
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:18,220
for what was the final word on that job I interviewed last week for. Finally they got

468
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:25,620
back to me and said I didn't get it on Thursday. On that same day I got a one day job for Friday

469
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:33,160
I just went in and on Friday I went up and typed in a bunch of names and addresses and

470
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:40,160
phone and fax numbers for a mailing list type thing for testing software, basically like

471
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,280
one of those Excel access, all those type testing programs.

472
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:52,320
I could have been able to list, they might have just told me wrong.

473
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:57,120
Let's do a woman in there talking about the governator over and over again to various

474
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,800
people on the phone.

475
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,800
Hear grumbling in the background.

476
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,800
It's over.

477
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,800
Let's not talk about it anymore.

478
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,800
Those aren't even real bakos.

479
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,800
No, they're fakos.

480
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,800
They're bacon flavored chips brand bacon things.

481
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,800
With no MSG.

482
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,800
Yeah, they are.

483
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,800
Sorry.

484
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,800
That's okay.

485
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,800
I might have kind of edited them.

486
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,800
Let's see.

487
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,800
faking things. With no MSG.

488
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:20,820
Sorry.

489
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,840
It's my job to make the random side comments.

490
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:28,860
Spend time putting stuff on eBay because I need to get money

491
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,880
fast before I run out.

492
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,900
And let's see, on Saturday I got invited out to

493
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,920
go seek a bill via one of

494
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,240
one person for people to know, Neil, but he invited me out and said that he paid for it.

495
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,440
But then I drove out all the way out to Fairfield, so that cost about the same amount as a ticket.

496
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,440
But I actually had gas, I didn't have the kind of money to actually pay for that, in

497
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,040
my wallet at the time.

498
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,360
So we saw that, and ate at the only Chick-fil-A in North Carolina, in Northern California

499
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,360
for you.

500
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,360
Chick-fil-A is awesome.

501
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,360
Yes.

502
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,360
And they're closed on Sundays.

503
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,280
and they're closed on Sundays yeah have that eaten there for like a year and a half

504
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:20,880
Chick-fil-a is the best chicken fast food chain ever you can only get chicks no I take that back

505
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,560
because there's a Chick-fil-a restaurant in Mobile but usually you know places I've ever

506
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,000
seen them or in malls and apparently the owner of the company is you know super Christian and

507
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,600
they're always close on Sunday but they have the best chicken yes that's very good and Polynesian

508
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:45,600
No one can hear what you're saying.

509
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,600
That's a good thing.

510
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,600
Continue please.

511
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:58,600
Alright and today just put more stuff up on eBay.

512
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:04,600
I don't need to figure out. I need to have a plan of action for looking for jobs really fast.

513
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,600
Food, food, food, food, food, food, food.

514
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,600
Basically, that's all.

515
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,600
Now everyone's asleep.

516
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,600
Wake up, wake up!

517
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,600
All right, I'll take over then, because I haven't talked about my week and my day,

518
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,600
and I know everybody wants to hear about my week and my day.

519
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:30,640
I actually did pay some money this week on Friday. I had some tokens left so I went by Roseville Golf Land and played two games of

520
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:36,280
two games of guitar freaks and one game of VDR, but then I failed on

521
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,520
Twilight Zone because I forgot to turn off the

522
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,040
shuffle and just failed right at the end.

523
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,880
Okay, there you go.

524
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,480
Okay, my week and my day.

525
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,600
For my week, I didn't do a whole lot of exciting stuff.

526
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:58,760
I played a lot of Final Fantasy X and they did a lot of napping.

527
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:04,800
Vanilla Sky on Monday was great, of course.

528
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,880
I went out to Golf Land on Thursday and I played some DDR and some S-Zero and I also

529
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,360
did Last Night, Saturday Night.

530
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:18,720
I don't really like going to Golf Land on the weekends because I run into too many people

531
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,560
are in line and stuff. I like seeing some of the people in the DDR community that I

532
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:27,240
don't get to see very often. That was cool because I saw one guy I don't get to see very

533
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:37,940
often. And then I see some good faces and that's cool. But then there's just a lot of

534
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:46,340
those like just people to get in the way. So I don't like that on Saturday and all the

535
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:52,020
you know the guy and their girlfriend that are trying to play DDR for the first time

536
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:56,620
because it's cute and stuff like that and I guess I should stop being so elitist because

537
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:00,940
that's how we all get into DDR at one point but I just don't like waiting is what it boils

538
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:06,540
down to so you know get out of my way I want to play. So that's why Thursdays are always

539
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:12,220
better for TDR. Friday night was supposed to be this great night where we were going to go see the

540
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:16,380
movie and we were going to go out dancing and we were going to get our slut on but it didn't happen

541
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:20,860
we just went to the movie and then went to eat and then we went home. We ended up going out because

542
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:24,460
we were all lazy and my friend at work is going to kill me because we were supposed to meet her out

543
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:30,060
Saturday night and we flaked. Yes, Billy was supposed to come back last night. My sister Billy

544
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:35,900
was supposed to be here yeah my sister billy uh was supposed to be here yesterday but he didn't

545
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:41,020
come back and i think a sheep ate him because he lives in chico and all they have up there is sheep

546
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:50,860
um and that was pretty much my day in my week because i did uh napping final fantasy 10

547
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:58,780
some ddr some f0 and kill bill that was pretty much it and jamie's destroying the kitchen

548
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:02,940
So I think now is a good time for us to take a break. We're going to take a break and we're

549
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,220
going to come back and I don't know what you guys want to do when we come back. We'll do a

550
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:11,500

554
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:34,260
bit longer in this break we're going to do yes it's longer and harder no we're

555

557
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:47,460
good break song so after this we'll be back with the F years of the week

Don't let it rest

Believe this is your track

As we're all sitting down

580
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,660
And looking back now

581
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:24,060
Is it alright to be the one for you?

582
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,460
When you're back in the city of the game

583
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,460
Play it safe for me, it's alright

584
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,460
You gotta find the way to the city of the love

585
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,460
You're supposed to be here for life

586
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,660
Even if your love is a laugh for you

587
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,460
You're just with me, the gift is going on

588
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,460
I'll be the one to tell you what

589
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,960
You know what you wanna do

590
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,960

00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,460
Well, you just got to move

592
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,460
And then you'll know just what to do

593
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,960
So that you even know

594
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,960
I can't really fall

595
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,460
Just feel the love inside

596
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,460
It's a little take for me to arrive

597
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:59,320
I'm a

598
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:03,320
I'm

599
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:07,320
I'm

600
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,320
I'm

601
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:15,320
I'm

602
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:19,320
I'm

603
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23,320
I'm

604
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,820
I don't know what to do, ain't nobody home

605
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:28,320
You're the best, you're the best, all that you know

606
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,320
You're even in your track, you're on and done

607
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,320
You're looking back now, is it all high or free?

608
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,320
You are the airway back to the last game

609
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,820
You're playing a game, you're still right

610
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,820
You're right by who says it's luck

611
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,820
You're about to play hand in line

612
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:48,320
Even if your love isn't left for you

613
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,820
It's a play for you, it's a show about hand in line

614
00:52:51,820 --> 00:53:18,140
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

615
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,140
Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?

616
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,140
No!

617
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,140
Do we care what people think of us?

618
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,140
No!

619
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:28,140
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

620
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,140
Yes!

621
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:38,140
Extreme Babani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

622
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:43,140
Hi, we're back.

623
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:46,140
I'm eating, sorry, and I'm drinking shitty beer

624
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:53,140
the Jamie's making me drink because she's a bad after-school special bully

625
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:56,140
see

626
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:02,740
no Triscuits reduced fat and wheathens reduced fat that's okay it's those

627
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:07,700
goddamn cookies where they like just totally don't even taste right

628
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:20,700
It's like eating reduced fat ice cream. What's the point?

629
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:34,340
But you know, ice cream is good. If you're going to eat ice cream, you know what?

630
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:39,180
The only beer that Orange Lounge Radio endorses would be Guinness, by the way, if you're curious.

631
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:44,380
I was going to say the only beer that we endorse is Guinness.

632
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:53,380
And why do we like Guinness so much, Jamie?

633
00:54:53,380 --> 00:55:00,380
yeah

634
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,900
uh...

635
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,900
Are you ready to do the F.E.'s of the week, Jamie?

636
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,900
This is Bob Don.

637
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,900
This is Bob Don.

638
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,900
This is Bob Don.

639
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:55,900
Oh, this is bad. This is bad.

640
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:32,900
No, it wasn't. Everyone just missed everything I said, didn't they?

641
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:33,900
I was just gonna say...

642
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:34,900
I can start over!

643
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,900
Okay. Um, I said...

644
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,900
Do you want me to start the music over?

645
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:43,900
No. I said thank you people at Walmart for leaving, um, your, uh, for not taking responsibility for your cart.

646
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:48,900
When you pull out your cart, you need to put it back up. It's really inconsiderate to leave it in people's way.

647
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:53,900
Um, and then I said about parents. Fuck all of them. Well, most of them.

648
00:56:53,900 --> 00:57:04,460
Especially if you decide that, you know, I want to have a kid and then you don't put any thought into the responsibilities involved with having the kid.

649
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:07,540
You need to take responsibility for yourself.

650
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:18,820
And then, oh my God, the people who blame everybody else for problems that they cause, you know, you need to, people need to learn how to take responsibility for themselves, for their own actions.

651
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:24,240
you know you can't believe everything that you see on TV you can't believe

652
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,600
everything that you read you need to learn how to think for yourself and so

653
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:33,160
that's everybody okay I'm really tired of people not everybody everybody in this

654
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:40,720
room is in the cool book so dangerous you're in the lukewarm book um fuck

655
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,140
Corona cuz it sucks but it's not as bad as that pale ale that I'm making Rob

656
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:55,600
drinks and really I can't think of anything else cuz what else was I was

657
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,260
like going off without today Rob and when I was going off in the parking lot

658
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:06,080
at Walmart I swear my best step is when I'm not on the show I don't remember

659
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:25,080
Fuck mages in Ragnarok, for stealing, for kill stealing, and then fuck glassheim for not bringing me the things to kill fast enough so that I can level faster because I have the archer and I can snipe off the wall.

660
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,080
And then...

661
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:35,080
Fuck me for buying stupid things that nobody wants to buy because I was up to 800,000 zenny.

662
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,080
And then I bought a bunch of stuff and then no one's buying it.

663
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:42,080
I made poison belts. I'm selling them for four times what they want.

664
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,080
Um, but that's about it.

665
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:50,080
Alright, we're gonna go to Loki who has to explain his new music.

666
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:53,080
It's in theme with the show.

667
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,080
I like it. It goes.

668
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,080
Some choking here.

669
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,080
Okay.

670
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:10,080
First nephew of the week is going to go to stupid drivers.

671
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,080
More particularly, old people.

672
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,080
I don't like you and you drive too slow.

673
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:21,640
slow and cutting in front of me and then driving so really pisses me off and

674
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:25,960
you're lucky that I don't have a gun because I would probably do a drive-by

675
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:31,560
as I'm passing you but um says I don't I can't do that all I can do is just get

676
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:35,080
angry and give you glaring look

677
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:45,960
also f you two or fucking neighbors okay can't park their truck worth a shit hey

678
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:52,040
yesterday yesterday I tried to pull out of our space and the guys over the line

679
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:57,200
like I practically have like squeeze through the get in there

680
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:04,140
meanwhile they're getting high out in front of their house also lucky is

681
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:09,060
stupid people at golf land there's some kid that like went and jumped up on the

682
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:12,760
pad and started tapping dumb buttons really hard while I was like installing

683
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:16,640
and then left and I didn't even give a shit at all I just didn't even look at

684
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,200
him didn't even get angry just pretend that it never happened that's just a

685
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:26,200
moth and that was funny and then um fuck you too uh

686
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:31,080
oh shit I don't know um the fact that I don't have any food in the fridge that

687
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:37,400
ate it all oh no I don't want the cracker so I'm eating uh potatoes that

688
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:44,960
are kind of going bad if it can go bad but anyways and then um let's see what

689
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:49,080
else I don't know I don't really have too much

690
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:53,880
fuck you the stupid VDR pads over at the theater because they were slippery as

691
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,560
hell I nearly killed myself on those just

692
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:02,560
playing normal songs not anything hard if I played anything hard probably blood

693
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:13,480
all over the pads which is unsweet. And then finally, just F.E. to Yahoo News because you

694
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:19,280
report on this really dumbest shit. Also an F.E. to British Scientists because don't you

695
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:24,400
have anything better to do than to test to see if a cookie crumbles and shit like that?

696
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:31,080
Stupid Brits. They're so dumb. No, it's all about budgeting. They start running out of

697
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:35,240
money for funding so they have to do stupid experiments so that they can keep their budget

698
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:43,720
oh actually finally fuck you to the ria once again actually more it's not really the ria

699
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:50,760
but mainly um well anyways let me uh just give a backstory to this about a week or two ago there

700
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:58,200
was um an announcement of this new copy protection for this cd or whatever there's some loser band

701
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:05,720
put out probably country anyways and so it got put out and then people found out

702
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:10,520
they can get past the cop protection by holding down the shift key well that was

703
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:15,680
pretty dumb of them now wasn't it anyway so you know a few weeks later this kid

704
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:21,500
in college writes on his web page basically it kind of like a little essay

705
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:25,720
or a term paper type thing about you know copy protection and he mentioned

706
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:30,920
on that how you can bypass that. One company didn't like that that they posted that on

707
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:40,480
his site, so they're suing him. Meanwhile, Yahoo! reports this, ok, reports a story saying

708
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:49,120
directly in that article, ok, that this CD can be bypassed by holding shifts. So, they're

709
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:56,120
suing him for his term paper that got, you know, viewed by a couple hundred people, maybe,

710
01:02:56,740 --> 01:03:01,520
whereas Yahoo! News gets viewed by millions and millions and millions of people. Isn't

711
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:08,520
that a bit ironic? Yeah, that's it. I'm done. I have a nephew of the week. I was at Golf

712
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:16,560
Land yesterday, and there was this really cool girl there, and I have no idea who she

713
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:20,840
is, but she wore a shirt that said this shirt was tested on animals. Something like that.

714
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:25,480
I thought she was cool. She's really good at DDR. She passed dropout, which is pretty

715
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:34,480
good. So, she was playing and these asshole drunk people got up next to her and started

716
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,480
playing without putting the money in. They were dancing on the pad, mocking her and stuff

717
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,760
like that. I fucking hate those people. So, F you to those people. But it was really great

718
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:47,620
because I couldn't find him I was in the middle of my game and by the time I was

719
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:53,580
done they were kind of they well this is what happened is that um they got up as

720
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:57,700
soon as I got off extreme they went up on extreme to start playing and she

721
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,100
finished her game right if they put the money in the machines just kind of

722
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:03,540
watched them for a minute and then as soon as they went to select a song the

723
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:07,500
drunk guy was like oh he's trying to pick a song right and she just walked up

724
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,700
hit the down arrow several times and then walked out the door

725
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:12,700
It increased the difficulty.

726
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:13,700
Cool.

727
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,700
So, they failed, by the way, if you're listening.

728
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:18,700
I just wouldn't have them thrown out.

729
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:23,700
I know, I... Keith wasn't there, and I don't like any of the other employees, really.

730
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,700
I don't know any of them.

731
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:30,700
You know what? I wonder if my track record would stay perfect, because I don't want that show playing.

732
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:31,700
What, getting people thrown out?

733
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:32,700
I guess I wouldn't have been out every time.

734
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:35,700
Not if you go Tuesday or Thursday, there's hardly ever people there on Tuesday or Thursday,

735
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,700
but like Saturday, yeah, you could.

736
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,700
You could have gotten those people thrown out.

737
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:49,480
to be my hobby. That's pretty much it. I don't really have F.U. to anything else. F.U. to

738
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:54,280
the fact that they decided to split Kill Bill into two parts because I'm impatient and I

739
01:04:54,280 --> 01:05:02,400
wanted to see both parts on Friday. You suck, Miramax. Alright, let's hear from the others

740
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:11,220
assembled here in the room we'll start with Andrew I'm not chub just do your

741
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:18,060
f-use all right f you to my Linux teacher deciding take a sick day two

742
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:22,060
days before the final first study day god damn it why do you gotta take a sick

743
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:26,060
Okay, someone needs to fix him. Make him all better.

744
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:40,060
F.E. was talking about something and just not being able to get your point across. I find it happens to me way too often.

745
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:46,060
Especially when I'm on this show. So, that's about it. Not too anxious for today.

746
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:51,060
Then, let's hear from Bradley.

747
01:05:51,060 --> 01:06:02,060
Okay, uh, fuck you to not finding work so far.

748
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:06,060
I didn't mean to work hard on that, at least I had that job, I think.

749
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:07,060
Thank you for that, at least.

750
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:12,060
So, fuck you to me for doing it too fast, because I got it done in like 5.5 hours.

751
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:17,060
They probably would have paid me for the whole day and I would have slowed down a bit.

752
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:20,060
Took a while to finish this.

753
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:24,060
Being a lady.

754
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:27,060
Too good at Excel, I guess.

755
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:32,060
It's kind of like thinking of other ways that I could have done it faster.

756
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:33,060
Anyway.

757
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:41,060
Fuck you to my falling credit rating, because I know it's doing that as we speak.

758
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:45,060
And bad things are coming on the horizon. I don't move really, really fast.

759
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:50,060
I'm getting stuff started paying off, and I'm finding a job, so.

760
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:56,060
And fuck you to Bank of America, because they changed their bill, they changed their credit card bill,

761
01:06:56,060 --> 01:07:05,060
So it takes a day to pay instead of the same day, so it fucked me up last month.

762
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:16,060
The guy taking too long so long to finally tell me that I didn't get the job.

763
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:21,060
Making me wait so long to wait to the inevitable.

764
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:23,060
Um...

765
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:25,060
Oh...

766
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:27,060
I don't know.

767
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:31,060
But here's the general situation.

768
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:35,060
I must per- persevere.

769
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:39,060
Okay. I think that's about everything.

770
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:43,060
I think.

771
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:47,060
Alright, then let's hear from our chat room.

772
01:07:47,060 --> 01:08:03,940
My FU of the week is to school, since tomorrow is Columbus Day and we don't have it off from

773
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:04,940
school.

774
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:09,660
Since I guess, finally, that our school has decided to be politically correct, since Columbus

775
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:14,060
never was the first person to discover America, but it was the indigenous Native American

776
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:15,060
peoples.

777
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:21,420
Damn school, we should still have a day off. It's supposed to be a national holiday. Fucking

778
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:26,740
bastard holes. Hey, guess what? Numb nuts, I have to work tomorrow. So you can damn well

779
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:34,060
go to school. And you know what? You should have to go to school during summer too because

780
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:45,740
I'll get summer off all right moving on zodiac night says my fuck you the week

781
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:51,700
goes to best buy calm for fucking up my order postponing my shipment of max to

782
01:08:51,700 --> 01:09:06,420
U.S. for another week. Minsk would like to say a preemptive F.U. to the week coming up.

783
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:14,580
It's going to be hell for me. F.U. to the bursars office at my college. They are charging

784
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:19,580
late fees to me for a balance I paid off three weeks ago.

785
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:26,580
Let's do em.

786
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:31,580
Oh, uh, well Jamie, would you like to repeat that advice?

787
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:33,580
Give Jamie a mic.

788
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,580
Oh.

789
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,580
Well, shit.

790
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:41,580
Um, so that's the FUs of the week since we didn't get that many of them this week,

791
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:44,600
So I guess y'all are having a good week. Lucky you guys

792
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:50,260
Loki what's going on in the sim world? Let's have a sim update

793
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:55,740
What I I don't care if he's in the kitchen

794
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:01,220
The show must go on god damn it

795
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:07,620
Let's see

796
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:12,620
I mean, it's 3.9 alpha 7 or something.

797
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:13,620
It's out now.

798
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:17,620
I can't even keep track because the name's getting too long.

799
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:18,620
God damn it.

800
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:22,620
And then some improvements have been made there, I think.

801
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:27,620
And then I know that they brought back Easy to Dancer support, which, yay.

802
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:30,620
And then, what else?

803
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:36,620
People are ripping stuff for Max 2, USA.

804
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:47,620
You know, God damn it, if I did it, I would have been done by now, but, you know, they're still doing it, and Lawrence from DDRUK is kind of heading up the project, so that's kind of cool, because he does a really good job on him.

805
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:55,620
What project? Why is it a project? If one guy can do it in an hour, what is needing to be a project of it?

806
01:10:55,620 --> 01:11:01,260
retarded these people are retarded they can't fucking just do it very simple

807
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:06,260
because it always has to be complicated they always have to like get six people

808
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:10,260
to do it or ten people to do it and no one knows what they're doing so that's

809
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:16,340
why it's complicated okay just wondering why is it always got to be so complicated

810
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:24,060
why you gotta go make things so complicated anyway other than that there's gonna be

811
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:33,020
also obviously now do your extreme stuff to rip so and then apparently you have

812
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:46,660
to pee too much if they're typing on a keyboard. Pee on the floor that would be

813
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:56,340
cool anyway now also another thing I found in my little travels on the board

814
01:11:56,340 --> 01:12:02,420
there they have someone made a because as you know step mania has an unlock

815
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:08,860
system just in case if you were to ever to you know want to do unlocks and then

816
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:13,980
so they actually made an editor so you can do an unlocks with an editor which

817
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:53,980
No, that's rodsteal0014. You only live until you die.

818
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:56,980
That's a title. It's a porno.

819
01:12:56,980 --> 01:12:59,980
Did you see that Brad and Irene loaned us the Whore of the Rings 2?

820
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:06,980
I haven't gotten to watch it. That's who it was. Brad and Irene. I was just thinking, Matt doesn't have porno like that.

821
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:15,740
There's really not much going on in the sim world.

822
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:19,860
I've been going on like 4 months now since I played setmania yet for some reason I still

823
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:20,860
download songs.

824
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:22,860
Of course I have it I guess.

825
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:23,860
Sucker.

826
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:25,860
Bandwidth horror.

827
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:34,260
You say that now.

828
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:39,820
It would have been a good parody of James Bond if they had just removed a lot of the

829
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:40,820
porn stuff.

830
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:46,980
It was funny on its own, but then they have people having sex for no reason and it just

831
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:49,580
detracts from it.

832
01:13:49,580 --> 01:14:03,420
I also got like six copies of Suicide Circle this week, maybe, yeah that's it, nothing

833
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:10,100

856
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,960
With a little clue that

857
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:11,960
There's nothing else that can make me feel the way you do

858
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,960
And the phones all don't provide the whumpin' heat

859
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:15,960
When the night starts talkin' through

860
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:33,960
Kissing you is more than I can stand Need you here with me, so baby

861
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:43,960

Hello? Hello, is this thing on testing? Testing one two?

865
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:31,560
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

866
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:35,560
Hello? I don't understand this. This thing works?

867
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,160
This thing reads like stereo instructions.

868
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:37,960
Is this on?

869
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:38,460

Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:23:55,540 --> 01:24:00,980
chirpy cells or perky cells tonight we're kind of in a mess sort of move feel perky

Oh, you're spent.

879
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:28,540

So we're all just spent then.

885
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:38,540
Yeah.

886
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:39,540
I see.

887
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:43,460
Well I don't know what to tell you, yeah we are all in a weird mood.

888
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:45,460
I think it is just the weather or something.

889
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:46,460
I don't know what it is.

890
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:47,460
Maybe we are just.

891
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:50,660
I am plenty happy and perky.

892
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:53,660
You rest of you are being.

893
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:55,340
Are you saying we are bringing this show down?

894
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:58,780
You are bringing me down man.

895
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:01,860
You need to kiss my ass woman.

896
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:03,060
Not my job, hello.

897
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:04,660
It is nobody's job.

898
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:05,660
It is alright.

899
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:06,660
Sorry.

900
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:10,780
Look at you puppy.

901
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:11,780
I don't want.

902
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:12,780
Eww.

903
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:13,780
Eww.

904
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:14,780
Eww.

905
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:21,180
You are disgusting Andrew, I'm glad nobody can hear that.

906
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:29,500
Umm, Loke you want to talk about some actual news going on right now?

907
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:35,740
I wish sometimes we were a TV show so you could have seen that throw.

908
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:39,220
I know what it is.

909
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:43,780
Kitty Jo says you guys are cranky and that makes me think yeah I think we are all on

910
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:44,780
our collective period.

911
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:46,980
We are all on the same cycle.

912
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:54,100
So right now, never mind.

913
01:25:54,100 --> 01:26:01,100
Last time I checked, Kitty Joe wasn't a psychiatrist, so, uh, shut the hell up!

914
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:08,100
Anyways, um, actual news, obviously, first thing would be, um, DDR Extreme, you know,

915
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:09,100
coming out.

916
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:10,100
Oh, yeah, that.

917
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,100
Oh, yeah, oops, forgot about that.

918
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:15,700
You know, that we've been playing the VRare songs from and the consumer track songs from

919
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:16,700
all night.

920
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:17,700
Yeah.

921
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:20,540
Cause, you know, we were kind enough to steal them from BomaniStyle because we haven't gotten

922
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:22,540
ours yet.

923
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:31,700
Yeah I don't have PMS I do that all the time

924
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:38,580
Loki news news oh yeah it came out um it wasn't a surprise because we knew it was going to

925
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:43,900
come out for a while now you know what's funny about this is that yesterday the 11th of October

926
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:48,020
was actually national coming out day so it's kind of funny to keep hearing you say we knew

927
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:51,740
it was going to come out it's going to come out for a while now I'm just laughing because

928
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:56,420
I am thinking of International Coming Out Day and DDR Extreme and how DDR is really

929
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:57,420
gay.

930
01:26:57,420 --> 01:27:06,700
But anyways, there are some songs on there, most notably the songs that we knew were there

931
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:12,820
and people were saying no you are wrong, like Max Period, everyone is saying that is a dumb

932
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:17,780
name for a song, how could that be coming out, well guess what it was in there and so

933
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:28,020
high laugh at you and then um what else oh there was um a new um well obviously we found out that

934
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:32,260
the song that everyone liked that we thought was called overloaded was actually a stupid barber

935
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:40,180
which is a stupid name it was a very stupid name for that song and then um also obviously under 12

936
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:45,940
was in there which is another one that was rumored to be in there and um scorched moon which i'm sure

937
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:49,980
we'll hear later was another one that was in there which is pretty cool and

938
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:54,700
see now what was interesting about the whole DDR extreme thing was is first off

939
01:27:54,700 --> 01:28:02,480
you had a new remix by 2mb which was max period and second and second of all max

940
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:07,780
period max period which was

941
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:18,720
So also you have Max 3 which people are kind of hearing that song going is this the end

942
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:25,320
of DDR what does this mean because obviously when we play it later on and for those who

943
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:30,980
have already heard it it's got the part thank you for playing and all that stuff it's a

944
01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:36,460
really weird song it kind of gives you the impression it's over and done with like there's

945
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:42,340
nothing more other than like this compilation crap that's coming out now

946
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:49,180
another thing also which is interesting kind of unrelated to the whole thing is

947
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:55,600
that I was looking I was looking actually in the max2 disk and you know

948
01:28:55,600 --> 01:29:02,120
how you can pull up because every single remix or every single game that comes

949
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:06,680
out has a full list of all the songs pretty much a master list of all the

950
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:11,760
songs that are actually going to be in the consumer mixes and the arcade mixes

951
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:19,040
and whatnot so you'll have this giant master list and Max 2 USA it's pretty

952
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:28,360
much a compilation up to DDR extreme and also with I believe the ultra mix which

953
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:33,800
which is kind of neat. But one of the things that I found in there which was quite interesting

954
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:39,640
was there was yet another Max remix that's going to be coming out pretty soon. Which

955
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:47,060
I have to find my list. Oh here we go. Okay. Here's one of the songs that was in there

956
01:29:47,060 --> 01:29:55,340
that was kind of interesting. It was Maximumizer. Which is kind of a weird name. Maximumizer

957
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:57,340
I guess maximum a miser

958
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:02,620
So I guess maybe that might be the new max for an ultra mix maybe maybe

959
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:08,820
Because I don't think that anyone in the right mind actually name a song maximum a miser other than katami

960
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:11,660
so

961
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:13,820
That was interesting

962
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:18,640
But yeah, that's pretty much all all the new wanna read these songs. We have any list there

963
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:18,940
Yeah

964
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:23,260
These are songs that are gonna be coming out or we're gonna come out like for instance

965
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:29,340
there's some of them that recognize one of them stronger by britney spears that was rumored supposed

966
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:34,860
to be in um euro mix 2 right no i don't know if it's in euro mix 2 but it might have been

967
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:41,900
the things that you do hula radio mix um i think that was also in euro mix 2 tamo was your mix 2

968
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:49,420
funk boogie i have no idea what that is addicted the bass i believe was ultra mix um disco 2000

969
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:52,460
I have no idea which one that would be.

970
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:59,260
It Takes More, I Don't Know, I Would Die For You, and For You being number four in You,

971
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:00,260
I don't know what that is.

972
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:03,780
I keep thinking of the Garbage Song, but that's the number one crush.

973
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:08,180
Shake Your Body, which I don't know what it is, I don't recognize any of these songs.

974
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:12,340
One Step Closer is going to be in the new Dancing Stage Fever, I know that.

975
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:15,820
Freak Like Me might also be in there.

976
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:23,020
When you look at me it's the Christina Milan song from, it's the song that we have in rotation

977
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:26,060
on the station actually, I recognize the song.

978
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:28,280
I think it's from Euromix too I want to say.

979
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:30,660
I think so.

980
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:41,660
Then there's Virtuality, which is another one, hold on, I don't think that's in DDR, I swear

981
01:31:41,660 --> 01:31:46,660
Dizzy, which I don't know what that is.

982
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:49,660
Darn, from back here it looked like Dirty and I got excited.

983
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:52,660
2020 Vision, which is, I don't know.

984
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:58,660
And Maximumizer, which is interesting, and Saturday Night Live, or Saturday Night Love, actually.

985
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:02,660
And those are the new songs to expect to see on some...

986
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:05,660
Clarification, what was the Funk B one?

987
01:32:05,660 --> 01:32:07,660
Um...

988
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:08,660
What was it?

989
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:09,660
Funk Boogie.

990
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:10,660
Funk Boogie.

991
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:14,540
So I have no idea what those are, but I guess they're going to be coming out later on in

992
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:15,540
some release.

993
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:17,540
So look for them.

994
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:21,260
It'd be interesting to look at the DDR Extreme list because you're going to have even more

995
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:23,580
of an update list on that too.

996
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:25,620
You can't wait to hack that disk.

997
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:27,980
Yes I can.

998
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:28,980
I can wait.

999
01:32:28,980 --> 01:32:33,780
You're going to have to wait until Tuesday at least.

1000
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:37,900
And that's hoping UPS doesn't say screw you guys and decide to wait until Wednesday or

1001
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:38,900
whatever.

1002
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:39,900
No, they delivered the rock line.

1003
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:46,020
You know, UPS has fucked me over before, but yeah, that's all that's new.

1004
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:50,620
That and Party Collection coming out, but we already know about that, DDR Party Collection

1005
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:52,620
coming out at the end of the year, right?

1006
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:55,420
I don't know if I want to fork out the money for that.

1007
01:32:55,420 --> 01:32:58,500
It's going to have to have the butterfly video, I figure, in order for me to pay for it.

1008
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:01,700
I'll get it, because that's December, so that's a ways away.

1009
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:02,700
Yeah, we'll see.

1010
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:03,700
We'll see.

1011
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:07,340
The next one we're going to be waiting for, though, other than UltraMix.

1012
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:12,180
I know I can't wait for DDR xbox is anybody in our little circle going to be getting it Jamie

1013
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:17,820
Jamie you're gonna probably have an xbox by then because obviously we know that they're probably going to drop the price

1014
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:18,400
Yeah

1015
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:25,820
If they if because this you guys know a gamecube gamecube dropped to $99 PlayStation 2 is rumored to be having meetings talking about doing

1016
01:33:25,820 --> 01:33:26,860
the same thing

1017
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:32,760
By next week and supposedly they sent promotional new material to target already that says $99 PlayStation 2 is

1018
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:35,760
So if that happens, Xbox is going to have to.

1019
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:38,760
They're not going to have a choice. They're going to have to drop 99 as well.

1020
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:41,760
And then also those N-Gages, they suck.

1021
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:51,760
Oh my God. I was so excited when Dan got me Plio Plio for our N-Gage.

1022
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:56,760
And you know what? It sucks. And this is me saying that Plio Plio sucks.

1023
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:00,760
So we're sitting here with our, at least we didn't pay for our N-Gage.

1024
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:04,760
I've heard nothing but awful things about the N-Gage.

1025
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:08,760
Oh, poor Nelly just got beat with the mic.

1026
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:12,760
I was going to say...

1027
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:16,760
Hey, that's a good

1028
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:20,760
quote right there. Orange Lounge Radio, when you

1029
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:24,760
taste the suck, you won't feel the pain.

1030
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:28,760
Yeah.

1031
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:40,760
I am going to put a link in there for everyone to see. This is me making fake ads. I will do one for Orange Challenge and a bottle of Corona.

1032
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:41,760
Okay.

1033
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:49,760
Yeah, the next one I think we have to really wait for is pretty much Karaoke Revolution.

1034
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:56,760
Karaoke Revolution is going to be a big deal. I think UltraMix is going to be interesting. The interesting thing about UltraMix is because of these song packs,

1035
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:01,760
We will be talking about Ultramix 3 months from now, like, you know, they released another song pack.

1036
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:08,760
I'm actually kind of looking, you know, it's weird, I actually really want an Xbox all of a sudden because I want Xbox Live.

1037
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:09,760
I just want a hacked Xbox.

1038
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:11,760
Xbox Live is the best thing ever.

1039
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:12,760
I want a hacked Xbox so I can...

1040
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:14,760
And I hate it, I hate it.

1041
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:17,760
This is like me admitting I like a Polteri song and admitting I like bag on the air.

1042
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:22,760
We need I J hacked Xbox.

1043
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:25,760
I don't even know what the difference is, I was just going to go to GameStop and get a refurbished one.

1044
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:35,760
Here's a different one. We take an Xbox, we have someone hack it for us, you put in a 120GB hard drive in there, and then you download games for free, baby. Oh yeah.

1045
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:41,760
That's the worst Austin Empowers impersonator I've ever seen in my life.

1046
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:42,760
That wasn't a pressure.

1047
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:43,760
But you went like, yeah, baby.

1048
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:45,760
It was funny. You had to see it.

1049
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:53,020
to see it throwing this mic around badly no the thing that's gonna be real

1050
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:58,060
interesting about DDR Xbox is the sucky pads since we can't plug in like

1051
01:35:58,060 --> 01:36:03,280
ignition I don't think they make a PlayStation 2 Xbox converter they do

1052
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:09,060
good I might get an Xbox for that then again I haven't gotten a system more

1053
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:16,060
recent than Virtual Voice.

1054
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:48,740
So, um, yeah, I don't want to like the Xbox, but I'm going to have to, and I really want

1055
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:55,980
to play PSO on the Xbox because somebody left their GameCube PSO for their Xbox PSO.

1056
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:59,700
It's because we already had the Xbox Live account.

1057
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:05,020
For some reason, they closed my GameCube account, so I just decided that I would play on the

1058
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:08,020
Xbox.

1059
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:20,020
Marin says she's going to be, if you see a Sky OLR on DDRXBox, that's Marin.

1060
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:26,820
The DDRXBox screens look very nice, I'm actually kind of, I'm excited about it, it's weird,

1061
01:37:26,820 --> 01:37:27,820
there are arrows.

1062
01:37:27,820 --> 01:37:32,580
I have a picture for it actually, it's in the GameStop promo book and it's got like

1063
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:35,940
all sorts of characters on there, I'll bring it next week.

1064
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:39,940
Dude, the cover of DDR Ultramix is like a big DDR character orgy.

1065
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:44,940
Who cares? It's arrows and music. Let it stick to arrows and music.

1066
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:47,940
But it's pretty. It's pretty arrows and pretty music.

1067
01:37:55,940 --> 01:37:58,940
Alright. I think we'll take a quick break.

1068
01:38:00,940 --> 01:38:02,940
And then when we come back we'll do the cage match.

1069
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:16,940
In this break I think we will finally play the max period because you guys have been dying to hear it.

1070
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:22,940
So we'll hear that. We're going to hear a stupid barber.

1071
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:29,940
And then we'll play Think You Better D the original mix because I fucked up last time and I actually played I Need You instead.

1072
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:32,060
So when we come back, we'll do the cage match and talk about

1073
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:34,420
more stuff, more news, more fun, here on

1074
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:40,180
talk about more stuff, more news, more fun here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1075
01:40:04,420 --> 01:40:08,420

01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,760
Supposed to open you down

1120
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:11,760
See, any quality

1121
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:13,760
Let's see, together let's live in harmony

1122
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,760
Look at the sky, keep your head on the rise

1123
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:17,760
These days don't rock so well

1124
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,760
Come on girl, let me ring your bell

1125
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:21,760
Still in a fight, you wear a bird of desire

1126
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,760
Fall alone and I'm back to the bone

1127
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:25,760
You gotta feel the pain, if you wanna gain

1128
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,760
Work that body, work that body

1129
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:29,760
Make sure you don't hurt nobody

1130
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,760
Girl, be my lady

1131
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:48,840
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join

1132
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:50,760
us on all the fun together.

1133
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:54,520
Hey, hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs

1134
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:58,000
absolutely nothing to go to, and still the fun is just as great.

1135
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,520
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

1136
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:05,220
Take it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

1137
01:45:05,220 --> 01:45:07,140
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1138
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:08,140
Give it.

1139
01:45:08,140 --> 01:45:11,140
Jamie is demanding the mic.

1140
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:12,140
Hi.

1141
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:13,140
Rob.

1142
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,140
What?

1143
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:15,140
Rob.

1144
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:16,140
What?

1145
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:17,140
Rob.

1146
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:18,140
What?

1147
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:19,140
Rob.

1148
01:45:19,140 --> 01:45:20,140
What?

1149
01:45:20,140 --> 01:45:21,140
Rob.

1150
01:45:21,140 --> 01:45:22,140
What?

1151
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:23,140
I hate you.

1152
01:45:23,140 --> 01:45:31,180
By the way, Max Resurrection and Neo Max suck and they will never be in DDR and so stop

1153
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:36,980
asking stop wanting get over it when real music gets made it will be put in the DDR

1154
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:47,860
not this crappy fan made shit I'm sorry no one can hear that you're on mic so a little

1155
01:45:47,860 --> 01:45:54,340
bit of the discussion from a commercial break carrying over to the show what what what what

1156
01:45:54,340 --> 01:46:02,500
what you do that again i'm going to shove that ferret so far up your ass that you'll

1157
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:09,060
be pooping ferret noises

1158
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:15,220
matt won't uh so easy and never fails loki won't max resurrection and uh neomax be in

1159
01:46:15,220 --> 01:46:30,160
your sim on your big arcade machine? No. You'll purposely be leaving them out? I have like

1160
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:35,540
27 max remakes because I really don't need them. I'm going to limit it down to like three

1161
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:43,760
or four. But will the Legend of Trance be in there? Um, maybe. It's pretty long so of

1162
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:50,320
course it's going to be in there, it's mine! Mine was better anyways. Actually I do think

1163
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:55,920
Legend of Trance was better than the other songs. It's just ok, Neo Max is ok, it's just

1164
01:46:55,920 --> 01:47:00,520
like they sat there all cool because they're doing piano noises, it just sounds like MIDI.

1165
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:06,840
It's like Star Mine, when that was made, that was actually pretty good. I mean if you get

1166
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:14,800
a remix of like Max 300 or something or even the Legend of Max. That would be awesome because

1167
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:18,640
I mean obviously what we're going to see here in the cage match. Oh, Ken did my pick for

1168
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:23,880
the cage match last week and he made pretty nearly a pretty kick ass. So I'd like to see

1169
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:31,600
him take on Max. So try that. Okay. Also during the commercial break in the chat room I was

1170
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:35,120
talking about I was poking fun at one of our people in the chat room who's having some

1171
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:38,540
trouble typing tonight because they're missing some keys and I was suggesting

1172
01:47:38,540 --> 01:47:42,680
some Mavis Beacon and I was just thinking about like how hot Mavis Beacon

1173
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:50,240
is man she's rawr. Has anyone ever seen Mavis Beacon? Just kidding I'm kidding.

1174
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:54,260
I have. How many versions of Mavis Beacon teaches typing have we had? They're on

1175
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:58,880
like version 15 I think I saw recently. You know what I never ever took any typing

1176
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:04,040
classes ever. Me neither and I learned how to type on my Commodore 64. I learned how

1177
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:11,740
I learned how to type out of a sense of competition with my roommate.

1178
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:15,080
My roommate at the time was a secretary and she could type really fast.

1179
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:19,400
Out of a whole sense of competition and wanting to keep up with people in chat rooms, I can

1180
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:22,860
now type at my best at 90 words a minute.

1181
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:26,240
That's what Iguana Girl and I used to do when we worked together so we'd have a little competition.

1182
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:31,440
It's just a friendly banter to see who could do more issues in an hour type thing.

1183
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:34,900
You were the two best workers in that whole fucking building.

1184
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:41,180
And even when I'm under stress I can still type at you know 70 to 80.

1185
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:42,640
And I type with perfect grammar.

1186
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:48,480
I suggest if you want to learn how to type you buy yourself a Commodore 64 because those

1187
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:52,560
computers are the shit and they have the computer inside the keyboard.

1188
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:53,560
How cool is that?

1189
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:57,480
And you can play Donkey Kong.

1190
01:48:57,480 --> 01:49:01,480
Alright, shall we get into tonight's cage match?

1191
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:03,480
Sure.

1192
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:06,480
Hi, this is Holly.

1193
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:12,480
Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1194
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:20,480
Loki's pick won, and he picked a remix of Paranoia called P8107 by, who was it again?

1195
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:21,480
OnoKen.

1196
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:22,480
OnoKen.

1197
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:23,480
And that was the winner.

1198
01:49:23,480 --> 01:49:26,800
in a pretty overwhelming response by the chat room.

1199
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:28,040
The chat room really, really liked it.

1200
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:29,640
So will they like it two weeks in a row?

1201
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:30,480
We'll see.

1202
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:31,960

All right, song number two, Turbo with Black Cat, the history remix.

1228
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:19,080
I'm being told that was the pick in tourney mix for actually I don't know because I don't keep up with tourney mix and I

1229
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:21,960
Don't play step mania. Well, there you go, but that's okay. I mean

1230
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:27,040
Who cares? It's about the song not about the step file. So Jamie, would you care to rank your own pick?

1231
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:33,180
You know, it wasn't it actually wasn't my first pick when I went to go check how long it was was 12 minutes

1232
01:55:33,180 --> 01:55:38,960
And I can't edit it down that small. So this was my next pick and it was pretty good and one of these days

1233
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:45,960
kostjamrh My thoughts are that's the gayest Pump It Up song ever, and it gets a 6.9.

1234
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:15,960
an 8 because it was alright. It was catchy, but I ignored most of it. Alright, Bradley,

1235
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:24,560
what did you think? Not pretty good. Yeah, here's when I started. You killed my through

1236
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:30,920
a fight. Yeah, that's okay. Uh, yeah, that was pretty good. I'll give it an 8. Alright,

1237
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:38,800
an 8 from Bradley. Andrew? Uh, it was alright. I've heard better. Maybe a 6. Honesty, best

1238
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:46,840
policy put the ferret down all right so a six from 23rd magus okay there you go

1239
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:50,880
ferret but you know what our opinions don't mean shit because it's your votes

1240
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:55,280
that ultimately decide it so you know it's like American Idol like that all

1241
01:56:55,280 --> 01:57:00,440
right here's my pick this is an artist actually put in the cage match like four

1242
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:06,120
weeks ago I think an artist that I put in the cage match like four weeks ago

1243
01:57:06,120 --> 01:57:13,320
um but i like this song like three times more than the song that i put in originally so um

1244
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:18,360
it's it's an old favorite family of mine to be putting in the cage match it's danny minnow

1245
01:57:18,360 --> 01:57:23,960
tonight and the song is all i want to do and it's not the cheryl crow song it's it's even better

1246
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:28,840

I may not be the innocent girl that you wanted me to be

1253
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:35,800
Sometimes I just want a lover Sometimes I don't need a friend

1254
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:42,800
Sometimes I just need somebody To hold me to the edge

1255
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:32,800
Let's take a look inside my heart Tell me what you think you need

1256
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:40,800
You may not see the innocent girl That you keep inside your dreams

1257
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:44,300
Tonight you're just one of the lovers

1258
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:47,800
Tonight you don't need a friend

1259
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:50,800
Tonight you just need somebody

1260
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:53,800
To hold you to the edge

1261
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:30,800
Take a look inside my heart

1262
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:37,800

Take a look inside my heart Tell me what you think you'll see

1264
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:06,520
I may not be the innocent girl that you wanted me to be

1265
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:09,520
Nothing just wanted lover

1266
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:13,520
And I just don't need a friend

1267
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:16,520
Nothing just needs somebody else

1268
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:20,520
Hold on to the end

1269
02:01:50,520 --> 02:02:09,940
Okay, that was song number three, Danny Minogue with All I Wanna Do.

1270
02:02:09,940 --> 02:02:10,940
Jamie?

1271
02:02:10,940 --> 02:02:11,940
Seven.

1272
02:02:11,940 --> 02:02:12,940
Too repetitive.

1273
02:02:12,940 --> 02:02:14,940
She's a slut.

1274
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:15,940
I give it a ten.

1275
02:02:15,940 --> 02:02:16,940
It's awesome.

1276
02:02:16,940 --> 02:02:17,940
It's the best song ever.

1277
02:02:17,940 --> 02:02:19,740
Logie.

1278
02:02:19,740 --> 02:02:24,740
I give it a 7 because I've heard that song way too many times because you play it all the time.

1279
02:02:25,740 --> 02:02:26,740
It's because it's awesome.

1280
02:02:27,740 --> 02:02:28,740
Bradley.

1281
02:02:29,740 --> 02:02:30,740
It's okay.

1282
02:02:32,740 --> 02:02:33,740
I'll give it a 6.5.

1283
02:02:35,740 --> 02:02:36,740
23rd, Magus.

1284
02:02:37,740 --> 02:02:42,740
After hearing Angel play it on her radio show all the time, it still doesn't get old.

1285
02:02:43,740 --> 02:02:44,740
It's still pretty damn good. I give it a 9.

1286
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:46,740
Alright.

1287
02:02:46,740 --> 02:02:52,460
Okay, remember our votes don't mean shit though, it's your votes that count, so place

1288
02:02:52,460 --> 02:02:53,460
vote now!

1289
02:02:53,460 --> 02:02:56,980
Oh, I'm sorry, we actually have to recap before we place vote now.

1290
02:02:56,980 --> 02:03:07,780
Song number one you can vote for tonight, last week's winner, P8107.

1291
02:03:07,780 --> 02:03:12,580
Alright, song number two you can vote for Turbo with Black Cat, the history remix.

1292
02:03:20,580 --> 02:03:25,860
Alright, and song number three you can vote for tonight is Danny Minogue with All I Wanna Do.

1293
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:41,420
do. All right. Place votes now. Send those votes to private message to sky in our chat

1294
02:03:41,420 --> 02:03:51,900
room. Okay, so we'll tally those votes in a little bit. In the meantime, more witty

1295
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:58,020
I thought I'd read this story for you guys and get your thought on this. This is a story

1296
02:03:58,020 --> 02:04:09,340
coming from BoycottRIAA.com, one of our favorite websites. Here's the headline, Kazaa Plans

1297
02:04:09,340 --> 02:04:14,580
to End Free Music. This was sent by one of our chat room loyalists.

1298
02:04:14,580 --> 02:04:20,940
Charmin Networks, like toilet paper, Charmin Networks appears to have finally crossed the

1299
02:04:20,940 --> 02:04:25,820
line with a bid to get into bed with the big five record labels in the RIAA.

1300
02:04:25,820 --> 02:04:29,940
Kazaa backs plans that could spell an end to the days of free music is the headline

1301
02:04:29,940 --> 02:04:34,860
in the October 10th edition of Australia's The Age, and Australia is, you'll recall,

1302
02:04:34,860 --> 02:04:37,100
the place Kazaa calls home.

1303
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:41,000
The world's most popular song-swapping network, Kazaa, has thrown its weight behind a plan

1304
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:45,320
to start billing song swappers for their music downloads," says the article.

1305
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:48,520
The proposal, which could finally end the days of the free lunch for millions of music

1306
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:53,540
fans, has been put to big U.S. record labels at the same time as the new legitimate version

1307
02:04:53,540 --> 02:04:57,440
of the former file-swapping giant Napster is launched in the U.S.

1308
02:04:57,440 --> 02:05:01,720
The idea is to phase in a billing mechanism for peer-to-peer networks such as Kazaa and

1309
02:05:01,720 --> 02:05:06,520
Morpheus that allow users to copy music directly from each other's hard drives, she states,

1310
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:10,440
going on that initially, payments would be by credit card, but in the future, downloads

1311
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:14,820
would be automatically detected and a charge added to the monthly internet service provider

1312
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:21,020
bill. What do you guys think? First of all, they have no real way to track something like

1313
02:05:21,020 --> 02:05:29,520
that. First of all, this is pretty much just like Napster was where they're like focusing

1314
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:33,540
just on Napster or just on Kazaa. Don't they realize that people have already left the

1315
02:05:33,540 --> 02:05:38,060
BitTorrent or like WinMX or something like that? They're just gonna dump, you know, drop

1316
02:06:08,060 --> 02:06:20,380
all right keep trying well what do you think 23rd maggots yeah sure sure let

1317
02:06:20,380 --> 02:06:24,380
Kazaa go to pay I'm still gonna use Kazaa allied still gonna go on the same

1318
02:06:24,380 --> 02:06:28,940
network so you're gonna get the same shit for free they can't track me more

1319
02:06:28,940 --> 02:06:32,260
power to them I don't care

1320
02:06:32,260 --> 02:06:48,040
First of all, I don't use WinMX because it's shit and it actually has, I've known people

1321
02:06:48,040 --> 02:06:52,460
though who through WinMX have had credit cards stolen off of their computer.

1322
02:06:52,460 --> 02:06:53,460
Oh wow.

1323
02:06:53,460 --> 02:06:54,940
Yeah, so don't use WinMX.

1324
02:06:54,940 --> 02:06:55,940
I deleted that.

1325
02:06:55,940 --> 02:06:56,940
I use WinMX.

1326
02:06:56,940 --> 02:07:01,660
But yeah, but a friend of mine who is very secure with the systems.

1327
02:07:01,660 --> 02:07:07,380
not the only person who this has happened to. Like if you have Paypal, it broke into

1328
02:07:07,380 --> 02:07:11,420
Paypal account that way. That's why I don't have Paypal save my credit card information.

1329
02:07:11,420 --> 02:07:17,620
But even so, you know, get that crap off your computer. It's not good for it. I have a feeling

1330
02:07:17,620 --> 02:07:22,160
that that's how I lost my last hard drive. I'm okay with it. It's still, I mean I'm not

1331
02:07:22,160 --> 02:07:28,120
really using it anyway. I only use it occasionally. BitTorrent is really my main thing. I'm still

1332
02:07:28,120 --> 02:07:32,320
because I plus plus plus my bank has auto protection against all that stuff

1333
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:38,360
because it doesn't log IPs good it doesn't log your your username it

1334
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:46,920
completely changed mine yeah it blocks 480 I mean it keeps you protected it

1335
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:51,040
keeps you anonymous yeah and you there can be multiple anonymous it cuz I

1336
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:56,980
thought whatever users logged in it does not keep a track of it once and you know

1337
02:07:56,980 --> 02:08:01,660
on top of that if you actually have it do not link to your files nobody else

1338
02:08:01,660 --> 02:08:04,900
can download from you so they have no way of tracking no way of knowing what's

1339
02:08:04,900 --> 02:08:10,180
there I always thought Kazaa was stupid anyway I've never used it I hate Kazaa

1340
02:08:10,180 --> 02:08:16,540
the new Kazaa is great is it Kazaa plus it's so it's absolutely easy and I

1341
02:08:16,540 --> 02:08:21,100
download and on top of that they've even tweaked the program now I have had 17

1342
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:27,300
downloads going at one time on Kazaa++. It's beautiful.

1343
02:08:27,300 --> 02:08:32,180
I'm still a big Bittorrent fan. I use Bittorrent for my anime.

1344
02:08:32,180 --> 02:08:36,920
What kind of sucks about Bittorrent, if you're the RIAA, is that now people are getting full

1345
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:42,620
CDs, not just songs. You just made things worse, and they keep getting worse. Bittorrent

1346
02:08:42,620 --> 02:08:46,940
is not only anonymous, but it's practically unstoppable. The only way you can really shut

1347
02:09:16,940 --> 02:09:21,900
it is they're just fucking stirring up the hornets nest they're making things worse people are getting

1348
02:09:21,900 --> 02:09:26,140
pissed and they're just going to say fuck you instead of downloading the one song i want now

1349
02:09:26,140 --> 02:09:33,740
i'm going to download the whole goddamn cd uh kitty kazza light does not have spyware in it

1350
02:09:33,740 --> 02:09:41,340
the original kazza used to they they claim now that it never did it did yeah it is bullshit it

1351
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:42,340
it did.

1352
02:09:42,340 --> 02:09:43,340
It had massive spyware.

1353
02:09:43,340 --> 02:09:49,340
That's the other thing that I attribute to the loss of my last hard drive over too.

1354
02:09:49,340 --> 02:09:50,340
Adware is our friend.

1355
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:56,100
Actually, there's a better program than that, it's called Adware Search and Destroy.

1356
02:09:56,100 --> 02:10:01,780
It hunts down any, not just that, but basic installers like for Bonzi Buddy or whatever

1357
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:04,340
and gets them off of your computer.

1358
02:10:04,340 --> 02:10:08,220
Fucking gator.

1359
02:10:08,220 --> 02:10:14,020
I had, actually, also WinMX does install Spyware on your computer, too.

1360
02:10:14,020 --> 02:10:15,220
Yes, it does.

1361
02:10:15,220 --> 02:10:19,700
Because after I was using WinMX, I went and checked, and I had tons of Spyware on my computer

1362
02:10:19,700 --> 02:10:22,020
just from that program.

1363
02:10:22,020 --> 02:10:27,180
Now, I actually checked about two months after using Kazaa++ and ran the Spyware check, and

1364
02:10:27,180 --> 02:10:31,180
there was nothing, other than what would have come through a web page.

1365
02:10:31,180 --> 02:10:36,540
But really, it's nothing, hardly anything, like maybe 10 files, as opposed to the 200

1366
02:10:36,540 --> 02:10:40,220
and something before with the old Kazaa I'll tell you one reason I actually really like

1367
02:10:40,220 --> 02:10:46,960
WinMX though is that it's the song sharing program of choice in Asia so a lot of like

1368
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:54,240
good Asian, Korean, Japanese, Chinese stuff on there I just Kazaa I hate it I hate Kazaa

1369
02:10:54,240 --> 02:11:01,600
I hate it so that's just me nah nah nah nah alright want to hear tonight's cage match

1370
02:11:01,600 --> 02:11:09,200
winner? Sure. It was a squeaker tonight boys and girls by one stinking vote. Tonight's

1371
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:22,720
winner of the cage match by one stinking vote was the one the only P8107. That was a close

1372
02:11:22,720 --> 02:11:28,960
one tonight. Votes were pretty much spread all out tonight which usually doesn't happen.

1373
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:36,960
Oh well, Jamie and I will try again next week to dethrone P8-101, whatever it is, P8-69-69-69.

1374
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:37,960
Alright.

1375
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:41,960
I have to think three weeks in advance for when I'm out of town.

1376
02:11:41,960 --> 02:11:42,960
I know, you're going to...

1377
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:44,960
I'm actually going to be gone the Sunday beforehand.

1378
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:46,960
You're going to have your work cut out for you.

1379
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:47,960
Because of family deals.

1380
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:49,960
Jamie's going to be gone for three weeks.

1381
02:11:49,960 --> 02:11:50,960
What are we going to do?

1382
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:52,960
You're going to pre-tape pump up the volume though, right?

1383
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:57,960
Yeah, I might record Tuesday show and then repeat it while I'm out of town.

1384
02:11:57,960 --> 02:12:07,960
Actually, on November 3rd, I'm actually taking Monday so I can do my show before I go to Alabama.

1385
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:09,960
Yeah, we'll do a show swap.

1386
02:12:09,960 --> 02:12:12,960
So there's only going to be two weeks where it'll be old material.

1387
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:18,960
I'm also going to be doing a special thing that I'm doing as a favor.

1388
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:21,960
More on that later, but it'll be replayed while I'm out of town.

1389
02:12:21,960 --> 02:12:23,960
Okay.

1390
02:12:23,960 --> 02:12:24,960
And that's really about it.

1391
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:29,440
Speaking of our spin-off shows, Monday nights on Orange Mountain Radio is Vanilla Sky where

1392
02:12:29,440 --> 02:12:35,960
we talk about the life outside of games as well as other gaming news, non-Bomani type

1393
02:12:35,960 --> 02:12:38,400
news.

1394
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:40,480
You should listen because it's great.

1395
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:46,080
Tomorrow night on Vanilla Sky, by the way, we are going to have a video game trivia to

1396
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:50,300
bad music written by somebody else, not me.

1397
02:12:50,300 --> 02:12:53,100
Somebody else is doing it tomorrow night so that should be interesting and I will be taking

1398
02:12:53,100 --> 02:13:00,260
the quiz tomorrow and if the subject is what I think it is I am so fucked what

1399
02:13:00,260 --> 02:13:10,260
Loki we should you should do one with the Sierra games remember the old Sierra

1400
02:13:10,260 --> 02:13:14,100
RPG oh shit those were the shit I'm so there

1401
02:13:14,100 --> 02:13:19,100
Canes Quest, Police Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, Space Quest.

1402
02:13:19,100 --> 02:13:22,100
Oh yes.

1403
02:13:22,100 --> 02:13:27,100
So, um, yeah, okay, um, what else was I thinking?

1404
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:35,100
Um, coming November again, Live Wire on Wednesdays, now, the new night.

1405
02:13:35,100 --> 02:13:43,320
Also coming in 2004, tentatively, most likely, brand new show called Orange Lounge Star-Cade,

1406
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:48,820
or not Star-Cade, Super-Cade, can't use the word Star-Cade because it's already a show.

1407
02:13:48,820 --> 02:13:49,820
Yes.

1408
02:13:49,820 --> 02:13:59,460
Brand new video game, game show, Super-Cade, every one Saturday a month, coming in 2004.

1409
02:13:59,460 --> 02:14:00,460
With prizes.

1410
02:14:00,460 --> 02:14:01,700
With actual prizes.

1411
02:14:01,700 --> 02:14:03,340
For our chat room.

1412
02:14:03,340 --> 02:14:04,340
Yes.

1413
02:14:04,340 --> 02:14:11,540
Your chat room and in-studio are in-studio players, one winner each, so it'll be cool.

1414
02:14:13,380 --> 02:14:14,620
That's going to be so exciting.

1415
02:14:14,620 --> 02:14:19,580
So pretty much imagine Starrcade with all the video game playing with a ton of trivia thrown in.

1416
02:14:19,580 --> 02:14:20,660
That's what you got.

1417
02:14:20,980 --> 02:14:22,380
It's a very complex show.

1418
02:14:22,380 --> 02:14:25,340
I have very, uh, I have to do a lot of stuff.

1419
02:14:25,340 --> 02:14:27,140
I've seen the rules for this show.

1420
02:14:27,140 --> 02:14:29,900
It's, it's, it's insane.

1421
02:14:29,900 --> 02:14:31,900
Yeah, it'll be fun.

1422
02:14:34,900 --> 02:14:35,900
Alright, I win.

1423
02:14:37,900 --> 02:14:38,900
You lose.

1424
02:14:38,900 --> 02:14:39,900
Alright, uh...

1425
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:41,900
I'm trying to fucking get...

1426
02:14:41,900 --> 02:14:44,900
Jamie, would you like to plug what's on Tuesday nights on this station?

1427
02:14:45,900 --> 02:14:46,900
A cookie?

1428
02:14:48,900 --> 02:14:49,900
Cookies of Doom Doom!

1429
02:14:50,900 --> 02:14:51,900
It's my show.

1430
02:14:52,900 --> 02:14:54,900
It's a Tiska eating show.

1431
02:14:55,900 --> 02:14:56,900
Um...

1432
02:14:56,900 --> 02:14:58,900
Go have Rob say something about you.

1433
02:14:58,900 --> 02:15:06,860
Sorry, um, well Tuesday nights on Orange Launch Radio at 7 o'clock is the pump up the volume

1434
02:15:06,860 --> 02:15:08,900
pre-show and then at 7.30 it's...

1435
02:15:08,900 --> 02:15:11,220
It's pump up the volume!

1436
02:15:11,220 --> 02:15:15,020
Which is where nobody requests anything cause you're all...

1437
02:15:15,020 --> 02:15:16,020
I'm sorry.

1438
02:15:16,020 --> 02:15:19,940
Nobody ever requests anything on my show so I'm like okay why am I doing this?

1439
02:15:19,940 --> 02:15:23,380
So it's basically where you sit for three hours and listen to whatever I feel like playing

1440
02:15:23,380 --> 02:15:24,380
for you.

1441
02:15:24,380 --> 02:15:25,380
Yes.

1442
02:15:25,380 --> 02:15:32,380
in our chat room and requesting songs and I would play them hello it's over at

1443
02:15:32,380 --> 02:15:42,540
1030 sometimes but that's yeah it's some of the volume my son little show all

1444
02:15:42,540 --> 02:15:47,260
right I think we're gonna do we're gonna take a quick break and then we're gonna

1445
02:15:47,260 --> 02:15:52,180
come back and I don't know we're gonna fill 45 minutes somehow with something

1446
02:15:52,180 --> 02:15:57,860
we'll think of something creative during this break list list or match game or

1447
02:15:57,860 --> 02:15:59,980
something like that we haven't done a list list in a while you want to list

1448
02:15:59,980 --> 02:16:09,040
list what what subject do we want to do I know we still we never did do the top

1449
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:14,420
ten names for Comcast I don't know I vote for the top three and cars you'll

1450
02:16:14,420 --> 02:16:19,020
never see an initial an initial D game I don't like cars and I don't like initial

1451
02:16:19,020 --> 02:16:25,180
D. So we'll think of something.

1452
02:16:25,180 --> 02:16:29,540
If you guys want to suggest a listless topic, we'll be

1453
02:16:29,540 --> 02:16:30,700
listening for you guys.

1454
02:16:30,700 --> 02:16:33,800
In this break, we're going to hear Sean the Horny Master

1455
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:35,100
with Scorching Moon.

1456
02:16:35,100 --> 02:16:41,580
That's another Dance Revolution EX consumer track.

1457
02:16:41,580 --> 02:16:44,140
And then we're going to hear a trance remix of music.

1458
02:16:44,140 --> 02:16:45,620
And I don't know where this came from.

1459
02:16:45,620 --> 02:16:47,500
Loki, you know where this came from, the trance remix of

1460
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:54,500
music on your computer? Yeah, it came from Winimax. It came from Winimax, alright. It's

1461
02:16:54,500 --> 02:17:01,500
not Transfersive, it's the Madonna song. Oh, it's the Madonna song? Yeah. Oh, I thought

1462
02:17:01,500 --> 02:17:08,500
it was music from 4th Mix, well fuck that. Play what then, Loki? I think it's the Night

1463
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:16,500
In Motion remix. The Night In Motion remix? Mmm, I don't think so. Here, I'll pick something.

1464
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:26,500
beatmania does outfades sink into trance remix

1465
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:52,500
of Enigma because their newest album sucked so yeah all right we'll be back

1466
02:17:52,500 --> 02:17:59,500
after this little break we'll do Shawna Hornymaster and Boom Boom. We'll be back.

1467
02:18:22,500 --> 02:18:24,500
I did it

1468
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:26,500
I did it

1469
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:28,500
I did it

1470
02:18:58,500 --> 02:19:05,500
I see that

1471
02:19:05,500 --> 02:19:12,500
I see that

1472
02:19:12,500 --> 02:19:19,500
I see that

1473
02:19:19,500 --> 02:19:25,500
I see that

1474
02:19:25,500 --> 02:19:27,500
I need it

1475
02:19:27,500 --> 02:19:29,500
I'll be there

1476
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:32,500
My heart goes on and on and on

1477
02:20:32,500 --> 02:20:36,500
Every time I think of you

1478
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:40,500
I need some control

1479
02:20:40,500 --> 02:20:44,500
No control of what I do

1480
02:20:44,500 --> 02:20:48,500
Integrity, complexity

1481
02:20:48,500 --> 02:20:52,500
The world of tragedy

1482
02:21:52,500 --> 02:22:22,260
All right, we decided to say screw listless and we're going

1483
02:22:22,260 --> 02:22:25,940
to do the match game instead, so in order to do match game I need some contestants.

1484
02:22:25,940 --> 02:22:28,260
So here's tonight's qualifying question.

1485
02:22:28,260 --> 02:22:32,460
The first two people in our chat room to send me a private message with the answer to this

1486
02:22:32,460 --> 02:22:35,660
question will be playing in tonight's Orange Launch Radio match game.

1487
02:22:35,660 --> 02:22:40,660
So I'm going to ask you a question from Monday's episode of Vanilla Sky, a video game trivia

1488
02:22:40,660 --> 02:22:41,660
to bad music.

1489
02:22:41,660 --> 02:22:42,660
So here it is.

1490
02:22:42,660 --> 02:22:43,660
This is the question.

1491
02:22:43,660 --> 02:22:46,980
First two people to send me the correct answer will play match game tonight.

1492
02:22:46,980 --> 02:22:52,180
What was the name of the game put out by Universal, which was similar to Dig Dug, but the object

1493
02:22:52,180 --> 02:22:59,320
was to collect cherries or kill all the monsters, including ones marked E, X, T, R, and A with

1494
02:22:59,320 --> 02:23:04,060
your Powerball. The category, just to help you out for last week's Vanilla Sky video

1495
02:23:04,060 --> 02:23:10,580
game trivia on bad music, was 80s video games. So there you go. One more time. What was the

1496
02:23:10,580 --> 02:23:15,060
name of the game put out by Universal, which was similar to Dig Dug, but the object was

1497
02:23:15,060 --> 02:23:20,720
to collect cherries or kill all the monsters, including ones marked E, X, T, R, and A with

1498
02:23:20,720 --> 02:23:38,120
your powerball?

1499
02:25:50,720 --> 02:26:03,160
Well hello, we're back, Orange Lounge Radio here.

1500
02:26:03,160 --> 02:26:07,280
And it's time, ladies and gentlemen, to play the Bahmani Match Game.

1501
02:26:07,280 --> 02:26:09,280
How exciting is that, everybody?

1502
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:10,280
Yay!

1503
02:26:10,280 --> 02:26:14,060
I've just flamed the rules because we have some new contestants tonight who we haven't

1504
02:26:14,060 --> 02:26:15,060
had play before.

1505
02:26:15,060 --> 02:26:19,560
I bet you want to know who those contestants are, huh?

1506
02:26:19,560 --> 02:26:26,760
us Rob tell us. Well in tonight's Bomani match game we have Zodiac Knight is

1507
02:26:26,760 --> 02:26:30,840
contestant number one. That's a buddy of mine from live journal so I'm excited to

1508
02:26:30,840 --> 02:26:37,080
see that he got the correct answer which was Mr. Do. We all knew that. Last week I

1509
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:39,520
tell you I don't think any of them got it right.

1510
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:43,800
None of the people here got it right that Mr. Do was a game. But that was the game

1511
02:26:43,800 --> 02:26:50,100
with the cherries and the ex-TRA monsters. Contestant number two tonight is AZN Buddy

1512
02:26:50,100 --> 02:26:57,680
Paul. Cool. He got Mr. Dew and he was second and just in case we have a standby as well

1513
02:26:57,680 --> 02:27:03,400
if one of them should drop. Alright, the way Bamani Match Game works is that I'm going

1514
02:27:03,400 --> 02:27:08,100
to ask a question and somewhere in that question is a blank. For instance, the question could

1515
02:27:08,100 --> 02:27:14,900
be Arkadian42 went to the store and decided to buy some blank. So all of our celebrities

1516
02:27:14,900 --> 02:27:18,780
here in the room will write down what they think should be in the blank. Propel! So propel

1517
02:27:18,780 --> 02:27:23,580
would be the answer that Jamie went right. Your job is to send me the answer over a private

1518
02:27:23,580 --> 02:27:30,340
message that you think is going to match with the most celebrities. And I'm supposed to

1519
02:27:30,340 --> 02:27:37,100
kick no styling. Why would I kick no styling Jamie? Change your name! Okay, so I hope the

1520
02:27:37,100 --> 02:27:41,060
contestants have an understanding of the rules yes you just send in what you

1521
02:27:41,060 --> 02:27:45,260
think we're gonna say for the blank and then for every match you get a point and

1522
02:27:45,260 --> 02:27:50,260

That's $80 I could have spent on blank.

1547
02:30:17,800 --> 02:30:21,760

Alright, here we go.

1564
02:31:23,880 --> 02:31:28,780
Let's hear what Zodiac Knight had to say.

1565
02:31:28,780 --> 02:31:32,820
Rob was sad to watch $80 go bye-bye for DDR Extreme to be sent to his house.

1566
02:31:32,820 --> 02:31:39,380
Damn, Rob exclaimed, that's $80 I could have spent on, Zodiac Knight says, male prostitutes.

1567
02:31:39,380 --> 02:31:40,380
Male prostitutes.

1568
02:31:40,380 --> 02:31:47,260
AZM buddy Paul says, damn, that's $80 guys could have spent on food.

1569
02:31:47,260 --> 02:31:50,740
Are you saying I'm fat?

1570
02:31:50,740 --> 02:31:57,680
alright we have male prostitutes and we have food we'll start with Andrew what's

1571
02:31:57,680 --> 02:32:02,360
your answer that's $80 he could have spent on chocolate

1572
02:32:02,360 --> 02:32:07,560
martinis and f-zero chocolate martinis and f-zero good answer good answer but

1573
02:32:07,560 --> 02:32:13,600
not a match Loki that's $80 he could have spent on man whores man whores

1574
02:32:13,600 --> 02:32:19,280
that's a match with zodiac night one point for zodiac night so the score is

1575
02:32:19,280 --> 02:32:29,760
now one to nothing you'd use it for 320 quarters to gamble with 320 quarters to

1576
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:35,320
gamble with very good answer but unfortunately not a match my answer and

1577
02:32:35,320 --> 02:32:40,920
this would be the correct answer by the way damn that's $80 I could have spent

1578
02:32:40,920 --> 02:32:48,080
on booze although close to a match with food I don't think the judges rule that

1579
02:32:48,080 --> 02:32:56,240
a match sorry Jamie propel $80 I could have spent on propel excellent but not a

1580
02:32:56,240 --> 02:32:59,960
match well I don't know does that count as food no no I don't think it does

1581
02:32:59,960 --> 02:33:04,920
either yeah cuz you drink it so the score is now one nothing zodiac night

1582
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:09,000
has one point and azm buddy Paul has no point that's okay cuz here's his chance

1583
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:18,960
to catch up. You guys ready? Question number two. Jamie left to go to Alabama for three

1584
02:33:18,960 --> 02:33:25,000

02:53:15,020 --> 02:53:24,540
who wants to know who would who would matt do if he did lose his big black cock i'm sorry what

1745
02:53:24,540 --> 02:53:31,100
What would Matt do if he lost his big black cock?

1746
02:53:31,100 --> 02:53:35,740
What would you do if you lost your big black cock?

1747
02:53:35,740 --> 02:53:38,780
I guess I'd just have to use my reserve big white cock.

1748
02:53:38,780 --> 02:53:41,500
Alright, excellent, excellent question.

1749
02:53:41,500 --> 02:53:48,620
ACM Buddy Paul would also like to know, would any of the Orange Lounge radio staff enter

1750
02:53:48,620 --> 02:53:49,620
Iron Chef?

1751
02:53:49,620 --> 02:53:50,620
I would.

1752
02:53:50,620 --> 02:53:53,820
Oh yeah, me, I'd be first in line. That would be fucking great.

1753
02:53:55,260 --> 02:53:57,980
So that is secret ingredient is microwave.

1754
02:54:00,380 --> 02:54:03,740
You know, it tastes really good if you add a nice butter to it, you know.

1755
02:54:04,420 --> 02:54:10,940
Anyways, I would yeah, I'd enter I'd be Iron Chef superfood. So yeah.

1756
02:54:12,060 --> 02:54:17,340
You know, the thing is, though, is that I could probably enter Iron Chef and fake my way through it.

1757
02:54:17,340 --> 02:54:21,340
Just because I used to watch all these cooking shows with my grandmother, like the Galloping Gourmet.

1758
02:54:22,340 --> 02:54:25,340
So, I can cook really good, I just don't...

1759
02:54:26,340 --> 02:54:29,340
I'm not saying that I'm as good as those guys, but I'd enjoy that at Iron Chef, just to be funny.

1760
02:54:29,340 --> 02:54:32,340
What would be the secret ingredient you'd secretly wish for?

1761
02:54:35,340 --> 02:54:37,340
Yes, instant rice.

1762
02:54:38,340 --> 02:54:42,340
My secret ingredient would be chicken.

1763
02:54:42,340 --> 02:54:43,340
Marin says propel.

1764
02:54:43,340 --> 02:54:44,340
Propel.

1765
02:54:44,340 --> 02:54:46,340
Cooking with propel.

1766
02:54:46,340 --> 02:54:55,640
I would bet that berry flavored, propelled steamed rice would be good or lemon flavored.

1767
02:54:55,640 --> 02:55:07,640
Next question we have is from Okyun. Okyun would like to know how are you?

1768
02:55:07,640 --> 02:55:12,400
How and you? I'm super, thanks for asking.

1769
02:55:42,400 --> 02:55:49,980
if you marinated me just right though I'd be damn good teriyaki me would be

1770
02:55:49,980 --> 02:55:56,800
good I I it was it was oke on oke on the terms whatever happened with fava beans

1771
02:55:56,800 --> 02:56:05,920
and nice Chianti all right moving on I I got the red arch it puts the lotion on

1772
02:56:35,920 --> 02:56:43,840
games. What kind of a dumb question is that? I don't want to mod my PS2 even if it means

1773
02:56:43,840 --> 02:56:50,840
I would get the better DDR mixes. It's country lockout. Yeah it's just country lockout. Maybe

1774
02:56:50,840 --> 02:56:55,400
the question is deeper than it sounds. Why does Sony feel the need to lock out the Playstation?

1775
02:56:55,400 --> 02:57:00,840
The same way they do for all games and have since the beginning of video game history.

1776
02:57:00,840 --> 02:57:07,760
should they have to do that? Why lock us out of the Japanese game? Market share. Domestic

1777
02:57:07,760 --> 02:57:13,640
versus foreign market. It's assy. It's assy and I don't like it. And copyright. You know

1778
02:57:13,640 --> 02:57:18,320
true that with the Nintendo all it was was finding an old copy of Garamite and you know

1779
02:57:18,320 --> 02:57:27,200
putting it on your game genie. But still you know they've had lockouts since the I think

1780
02:57:27,200 --> 02:57:33,960
the Master System had lockouts because of the pin cards. The PC Engine, you can't even

1781
02:57:33,960 --> 02:57:39,920
find a good converter to play Japanese U-Cards on a TurboGrafx. Now, however, the games did

1782
02:57:39,920 --> 02:57:44,760
not have country lockout. The CDs did not, but it was new technology. Well, it doesn't

1783
02:57:44,760 --> 02:57:48,120
really matter anymore anyway because we do have all these fancy ways of getting around

1784
02:57:48,120 --> 02:57:53,400
the country lockout. You know how I got around it? How? I bought a JPS2. I held the shift

1785
02:57:53,400 --> 02:57:57,720
key while putting in the disc now they have this thing if I think if they sell

1786
02:57:57,720 --> 02:58:03,400
it on ncsx where you pull the lid it's like a new case that you put on your ps2

1787
02:58:03,400 --> 02:58:07,920
and you can lift the lid off and it'll you have a card that will stop the game

1788
02:58:07,920 --> 02:58:10,920
from spinning and you change out the disc it's really stupid it's like the

1789
02:58:10,920 --> 02:58:17,080
old remember the on the old PlayStation they're like multi flop yes oh god I've

1790
02:58:17,080 --> 02:58:21,840
seen someone do this the seven-point swap you know what that's right that's

1791
02:58:21,840 --> 02:58:26,160
That's why we had, we bought the last Dualshock system that still had the IO port so we could

1792
02:58:26,160 --> 02:58:29,160
use our GameShark.

1793
02:58:29,160 --> 02:58:44,320
And we still had the old

1794
02:58:44,320 --> 02:59:08,800
to know?

1795
02:59:08,800 --> 02:59:13,200
In your opinions, at what point, what number mix?

1796
02:59:13,200 --> 02:59:19,200
it be a good time to stop the DDR series and infinity is not an answer that was

1797
02:59:19,200 --> 02:59:24,440
with max thank you so you think DDR was pretty much dead at six I keep playing

1798
02:59:24,440 --> 02:59:29,560
it why not but you know it's just the same old thing there's not really much

1799
02:59:29,560 --> 02:59:33,000
innovative that they can do with it all right

1800
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:37,160
anybody else get answer facility in a second mix was the best I have an answer

1801
02:59:37,160 --> 02:59:46,280
but I'll wait Magus take it to 9 make a final be done with it make it like beat

1802
02:59:46,280 --> 02:59:50,660
mania just take it 9 in the final that's it

1803
02:59:50,660 --> 02:59:57,500
low key care to comment so just keep making more and be glad it's still

1804
02:59:57,500 --> 03:00:01,640
around cuz then they're not gonna make stupid ripoff like Brittany's dance beat

1805
03:00:01,640 --> 03:00:10,080
the arcade game or some shit like that Barney's dance magic I love you you love

1806
03:00:10,080 --> 03:00:18,480
me I'm a drunk inside a suit here's my thought on it DDR should stop at 8th mix

1807
03:00:18,480 --> 03:00:22,840
extreme should be the last one remember how the little thing doesn't make any

1808
03:00:22,840 --> 03:00:28,280
sense you are starting over if they don't this is my thing though DDR as we

1809
03:00:28,280 --> 03:00:35,440
know it should be done I want DDR DX now I want DDR 2 I want DDR something new

1810
03:00:35,440 --> 03:00:43,520
DDR as we know it is done so forget it but I think dancing games by Konami are

1811
03:00:43,520 --> 03:00:46,640
not done yet and I think we'll see something new and it's going to be

1812
03:00:46,640 --> 03:00:50,140
something like competitive I always say this I say this like at least every

1813
03:00:50,140 --> 03:00:54,720
month on the show the next DDR should be something competitive DDR has always

1814
03:00:54,720 --> 03:00:58,260
been very cooperative game with some competitive modes but they haven't been

1815
03:00:58,260 --> 03:01:02,700
very and there haven't been much to them second mix that battle was maybe like

1816
03:01:02,700 --> 03:01:07,320
the most competitive thing DDR ever had and then he had unison mode and then

1817
03:01:07,320 --> 03:01:10,540
battle mode was like nothing that was just another way of doing versus mode

1818
03:01:10,540 --> 03:01:14,260
but having like a dance magic competitive mode or something more

1819
03:01:14,260 --> 03:01:19,440
competitive I think is where DDR should go next but who knows what Konami has an

1820
03:01:19,440 --> 03:01:24,800
an idea of. Maybe they'll surprise me. But please God, please, no sequels to Dance Dance

1821
03:01:24,800 --> 03:01:31,200
Dance. Thank you. Justin B. would like to know, will you play my crappy remix so that

1822
03:01:31,200 --> 03:01:35,840
people can laugh at it? He has a new remix he wants us to play. We're running out of

1823
03:01:35,840 --> 03:01:42,240
time on the show but we'll do it in the after birth and we'll all laugh at it. So stay tuned.

1824
03:01:42,240 --> 03:01:46,080
Azie and Buddy Paul, this is the last question of the night, thank you all for participating in

1825
03:01:46,080 --> 03:01:47,080
Ask Orange Lounge.

1826
03:01:47,080 --> 03:01:51,240
Azie and Buddy Paul would like to know, what do you think about Sky starring in Kill Bill

1827
03:01:51,240 --> 03:01:54,120
Volume 2?

1828
03:01:54,120 --> 03:01:57,680
I think that he would probably be the first one killed by another man.

1829
03:01:57,680 --> 03:02:01,360
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I don't like that attitude.

1830
03:02:01,360 --> 03:02:05,760
You know what though, Kill Bill Volume 2 is already done and shot so I can't really be

1831
03:02:05,760 --> 03:02:09,400
in it unfortunately.

1832
03:02:09,400 --> 03:02:14,580
I would love to be just some guy that has a cameo that decides to purchase the pussy

1833
03:02:14,580 --> 03:02:20,860
Wagon when all is said and done. The new owner of the Pussy Wagon. Yes, Loki, you want to

1834
03:02:20,860 --> 03:02:26,420
answer the question? I would have just shot her dead. She has a sword. Oh, you're gonna

1835
03:02:26,420 --> 03:02:33,420
go ninjutsu on me, huh? Indiana Jones all over again, bitch. I don't want to spoil anything.

1836
03:02:33,420 --> 03:02:36,880
I don't want to spoil anything, but I could say something. I don't want to spoil anything.

1837
03:02:36,880 --> 03:02:37,880
I already know.

1838
03:02:37,880 --> 03:02:38,880
I already know.

1839
03:02:38,880 --> 03:02:39,880
So ha.

1840
03:02:39,880 --> 03:02:40,880
Alright.

1841
03:02:40,880 --> 03:02:41,880
Yeah.

1842
03:02:41,880 --> 03:02:42,880
Yeah.

1843
03:02:42,880 --> 03:02:43,880
Okay.

1844
03:02:43,880 --> 03:02:46,160
So thank you very much for asking Orange Lounge tonight.

1845
03:02:46,160 --> 03:02:53,640
We hope you all learn something as we do every week on Ask Orange Lounge.

1846
03:02:53,640 --> 03:02:54,640
I don't feel like singing.

1847
03:02:54,640 --> 03:03:15,920
Well kids, it's about time for us to wrap up this train wreck of show that we call Orange

1848
03:03:15,920 --> 03:03:16,920
Lounge Radio.

1849
03:03:16,920 --> 03:03:19,440
So we're going to get everybody's final thoughts.

1850
03:03:19,440 --> 03:03:22,960
We'll start with Bradley.

1851
03:03:22,960 --> 03:03:28,960
I hope I make it. I certainly hope I do.

1852
03:03:28,960 --> 03:03:31,960
We hope you make it too.

1853
03:03:31,960 --> 03:03:34,960
23rd Magus.

1854
03:03:34,960 --> 03:03:36,960
Boobies.

1855
03:03:36,960 --> 03:03:42,960
Boobies is your final thought. Thank you, that's so mature.

1856
03:03:42,960 --> 03:03:48,960
You're such a teenage boy. You are such a teenage boy.

1857
03:03:48,960 --> 03:03:50,960
Well, yeah.

1858
03:03:50,960 --> 03:03:52,640
Yeah I know.

1859
03:03:52,640 --> 03:03:54,640
Logie your final thought?

1860
03:03:54,640 --> 03:04:01,840
Toga, toga, toga, toga.

1861
03:04:01,840 --> 03:04:03,160
Jamie your final thought?

1862
03:04:03,160 --> 03:04:09,640
My final thought is, do you call that begging?

1863
03:04:09,640 --> 03:04:17,160
My final thought is, bingo!

1864
03:04:17,160 --> 03:04:22,640
And uh, oh did I take your word, I'm sorry.

1865
03:04:22,640 --> 03:04:23,640
My bad, sorry.

1866
03:04:23,640 --> 03:04:24,640
Another one.

1867
03:04:24,640 --> 03:04:29,760
Well, hold on, we'll get, oh you have another final thought, oh okay, we'll get to the word

1868
03:04:29,760 --> 03:04:30,760
in a minute.

1869
03:04:30,760 --> 03:04:33,320
We'll get to the word in a minute, but I just wanted to thank everybody for listening to

1870
03:04:33,320 --> 03:04:37,400
and supporting Orange Lawns Radio, without you we're nothing, we're shit, we suck, we're

1871
03:04:37,400 --> 03:04:44,120
were scum. No, we're still great either way. But no, we do thank you for your support and

1872
03:04:44,120 --> 03:04:50,960
thanks for tuning in as you do every Sunday night and take care of yourself and each other.

1873
03:04:50,960 --> 03:04:58,960
Tonight's final word goes to Jamie. You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1874
03:04:58,960 --> 03:05:05,720
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki. We expect you a nice play again.

1875
03:05:05,720 --> 03:05:08,720
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

1876
03:05:08,720 --> 03:05:14,720
As your leader, I encourage you from time to time and always in a respectful manner

1877
03:05:14,720 --> 03:05:16,720
to question my options.

1878
03:05:16,720 --> 03:05:21,720
If you're unconvinced a particular plan of action I've decided is the wise, tell me so.

1879
03:05:21,720 --> 03:05:29,720
But allow me to convince you, and I promise you right here and now, no subject will ever be taboo.

1880
03:05:29,720 --> 03:05:32,620
Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion.

1881
03:05:35,620 --> 03:05:41,520
The price you pay for bringing up either my Chinese or American heritage as a negative is...

1882
03:05:42,020 --> 03:05:43,720
I collect your fucking head.

1883
03:05:44,720 --> 03:05:46,520
Just like this fucker here.

1884
03:05:49,220 --> 03:05:56,120
Now, if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

1885
03:05:56,120 --> 03:06:01,120
I didn't think so.

1886
03:06:01,120 --> 03:06:08,120
Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.

1887
03:06:31,120 --> 03:06:43,800
Alright, welcome back boys and girls to Orange Lawn's radio to Afterbirth. So as promised,

1888
03:06:43,800 --> 03:06:49,600
this is when you covered in Ask Orange Lawn. Rob, can I collect your fucking head? No,

1889
03:06:49,600 --> 03:06:55,320
you may not collect my fucking head. We kind of have to make this a quick Afterbirth because

1890
03:06:55,320 --> 03:06:58,880
we're running into the movie theater to go see Kill Bill for the second time from Magus's

1891
03:06:58,880 --> 03:07:03,900
case the first time. He's a Kill Bill virgin. I encourage you to see Kill Bill as many times

1892
03:07:03,900 --> 03:07:07,760
as you can at the theater. I think this should be the new cult movie. This should be like

1893
03:07:07,760 --> 03:07:11,840
the Rocky Horror Picture Show Part 2 or something. Wouldn't this be fun to shadow cast? Oh my

1894
03:07:11,840 --> 03:07:19,320
god, I'd so be like a member of the 88 gang. I would of course have to take GoGo's character.

1895
03:07:19,320 --> 03:07:27,300
Alright. Here we go. This is from our very own Justin Beah. We play things that our chat

1896
03:07:27,300 --> 03:07:31,760
room builds because we support our chat room just like they support us we're gonna play

1897
03:07:31,760 --> 03:07:38,320
something it's a remix he did it's the speedy mix because you know justin b this is uh jamma

1898
03:07:38,320 --> 03:07:41,960
and the song is called gotta dance and he apparently remixed this quite a bit apparently

1899
03:07:41,960 --> 03:07:47,000
the vocals are the only thing from the original song the rest of it he did so enjoy let us

1900
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:54,000
know what you think. This is Jammo with Gotta Dance, the Speedy Mix by Justin Bieber.

1901
03:09:47,000 --> 03:10:06,560
well we need to laugh at it now ha ha ha ha remix ha ha ha speedy mix ha ha and if

1902
03:10:06,560 --> 03:10:10,480
sauce hasn't seen um kill bill by the time we go to alabama i'll pay it for her to see it

1903
03:10:10,480 --> 03:10:15,960
Of course I can upload it to her.

1904
03:10:15,960 --> 03:10:22,160
Now we don't endorse piracy here on Orange Lounge Radio, we endorse it.

1905
03:10:22,160 --> 03:10:27,920
Hi, I don't really have anything interesting to say in the after work tonight.

1906
03:10:27,920 --> 03:10:29,880
No, I have a headache.

1907
03:10:29,880 --> 03:10:32,080
Yeah, we're just all in a mad kind of mood.

1908
03:10:32,080 --> 03:10:35,880
We're all in a pissy mood, remember?

1909
03:10:35,880 --> 03:10:39,120
What I feel Orange Lounge Vocal edit, I don't remember, was that the one where I was going

1910
03:11:09,120 --> 03:11:35,120
Oh, was it BRP Ohio, I'm sorry. Oh, my bad. Interesting. Interesting. Oh, sorry for mixing that up. I just can't remember. So many cool people on our show. Okay. If nobody else has anything to say, then I guess that's the afterword.

1911
03:11:35,120 --> 03:11:44,760
We are going to do in the post show here, what should we play for them post show tonight?

1912
03:11:44,760 --> 03:11:45,760
Eurobeat.

1913
03:11:45,760 --> 03:11:46,760
Eurobeat?

1914
03:11:46,760 --> 03:11:47,760
Yeah.

1915
03:11:47,760 --> 03:11:52,000
I don't know if I have any Eurobeat albums really.

1916
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:55,960
Don't you have my CD with the 614 megabytes of Eurobeat?

1917
03:11:55,960 --> 03:11:56,960
I do.

1918
03:11:56,960 --> 03:11:57,960
I do somewhere.

1919
03:11:57,960 --> 03:11:58,960
Hold on I'll find it.

1920
03:11:58,960 --> 03:11:59,960
You have to fill time while I find it though.

1921
03:11:59,960 --> 03:12:03,960
I was supposed to do a Eurobeat marathon and I didn't.

1922
03:12:03,960 --> 03:12:05,960
I feel so bad.

1923
03:12:05,960 --> 03:12:08,960
I played Happy Hardcore instead.

1924
03:12:08,960 --> 03:12:11,960
I think it was volume 7 of Happy to be Hardcore.

1925
03:12:11,960 --> 03:12:15,960
I need to go back and get the others.

1926
03:12:15,960 --> 03:12:19,960
I don't need to get that CD when you're talking about it.

1927
03:12:19,960 --> 03:12:22,960
Somebody alert No Styling that we're going to do a Eurobeat marathon.

1928
03:12:22,960 --> 03:12:27,960
Yeah, make sure that he's got a change of underwear handy or something.

1929
03:12:27,960 --> 03:12:30,960
Because he's probably going to go through about five of them.

1930
03:12:33,960 --> 03:12:39,960
Alright, the room is already excited about this one, so hopefully the CD is not scratched too bad and it will play alright.

1931
03:12:39,960 --> 03:12:43,960
So, um, we'll see what happens here.

1932
03:12:45,960 --> 03:12:48,960
Alright, I think we're set here. I'm just going to cue up all the music.

1933
03:12:52,960 --> 03:12:56,960
Thank you once again, boys and girls, for your loving and caring support of Orange Lounge Radio. We appreciate it.

1934
03:12:56,960 --> 03:13:03,160
it and this Euro beats for you. We'll go pa-da-pa-da our way to the movie theater.

1935
03:13:03,160 --> 03:13:11,520
Yes, we're going to pa-da-pa-da our ass off at the movie theater. Is it going? If it skips,

1936
03:13:11,520 --> 03:13:15,520
I apologize in advance. The CD might be a little skip, but we're going to do our best.

1937
03:13:15,520 --> 03:13:17,520
Goodnight everybody!

1938
03:13:45,520 --> 03:14:03,520
I still wanna lose you, cause I gotta love you now

1939
03:14:03,520 --> 03:14:08,520

We were lucky to get the voice

1942
03:14:13,520 --> 03:14:15,520

1948
03:14:25,520 --> 03:14:27,520
Yellow brick road

1949

Do you remember the time tonight?

1950
03:14:29,520 --> 03:14:31,520

Nothing will sing and I can take another time

1957

Yes, I'm your love boy, and I'll give to you my love, but I remember

03:16:19,520 --> 03:16:32,640
You can change everything you want The story we've got remains the same

1973
03:16:32,640 --> 03:16:52,640
Goodbye, yellow brick road, do you remember the time tonight?

You

We stay together till the morning light Don't stand so, don't stand so, don't stand so close to me

1979
03:18:16,140 --> 03:18:36,140
Baby you belong to me, yes you do, yes you do You're in my faction, I can't make you want to cry

1980
03:18:36,140 --> 03:18:52,140
If I do, if I do, I will be good You're like a cruel device, your blood is cold Like ice boiling from my veins, I'm breaking my chains One look and you can't kill My pain, I'll miss your thrill, you'll love it for me

1981
03:18:52,140 --> 03:18:55,880
I said, try me, take a chance of emotion

1982
03:18:55,880 --> 03:18:58,560
but now it never grows to your heart

1983
03:18:58,560 --> 03:19:02,220
I said, try me, take a chance of affection

1984
03:19:02,220 --> 03:19:04,660
we'll fit together all the time

1985
03:19:04,660 --> 03:19:08,240

Don't stand so, don't stand so, don't stand so close to me

1990
03:19:36,400 --> 03:19:38,400
Baby, let me take control

1991
03:19:39,400 --> 03:19:40,900
Yes, I do, yes, I do

1992
03:19:40,900 --> 03:19:42,400
You're a monster, I guess

1993
03:19:42,400 --> 03:19:44,400
No one ever makes me cry

1994
03:19:45,400 --> 03:19:47,200
What you do, what you do

1995
03:19:47,200 --> 03:19:48,200
This is the best

1996
03:19:49,200 --> 03:19:50,200
You're like a cruising bike

1997
03:19:50,200 --> 03:19:53,200
Your blood is cold like an explosion from my veins

1998
03:19:53,200 --> 03:19:55,200
I'm breaking my chains

1999
03:19:55,200 --> 03:19:57,200
One look and you can't kill my pain

2000
03:19:57,200 --> 03:19:58,200
I'll miss your thrill

2001
03:19:58,200 --> 03:20:00,200
Your love is for me

2002
03:20:00,200 --> 03:20:02,200
I said try me

2003
03:20:02,200 --> 03:20:04,200
Take a chance of emotion

2004
03:20:04,200 --> 03:20:06,200
But now we're never close to your heart

2005
03:20:06,200 --> 03:20:08,200
I said try me

But now we're never into my heart, I said try me

2011
03:20:20,200 --> 03:20:22,200
Take a chance on my passion

2012
03:20:22,200 --> 03:20:26,200
We'll be together till the morning light

2013
03:20:26,200 --> 03:20:29,200
Don't stand so, don't stand so

2014
03:20:29,200 --> 03:20:31,700
Now it stands so close to me

2015
03:20:31,700 --> 03:20:59,700
I bet try me, take a chance on emotion

2016
03:20:59,700 --> 03:21:02,200

I said try me, take a chance on my passion

2022
03:21:19,280 --> 03:21:21,680
We be together till the morning light

2023
03:21:21,680 --> 03:21:27,680
I don't stand so, don't stand so, don't stand so close to me

2024
03:21:39,680 --> 03:21:42,680
Drive me, take a stand from emotion

2025
03:21:42,680 --> 03:21:45,680
From now and never go through your heart

2026
03:21:45,680 --> 03:21:48,680
I said drive me, take a stand from affection

2027
03:21:48,680 --> 03:21:51,680
We speak together all the time

2028
03:21:51,680 --> 03:21:54,680
Say try me, take a sense of emotion

2029
03:21:54,680 --> 03:21:57,680
For now we're never into my heart

2030
03:21:57,680 --> 03:22:01,680
Say try me, take a sense of affection

2031
03:22:01,680 --> 03:22:04,680
We speak together till the morning light

2032
03:22:04,680 --> 03:22:07,680
Don't stand so, don't stand so

2033
03:22:07,680 --> 03:22:10,680
Nothing so good to me

2034
03:22:37,680 --> 03:22:48,680
4, 3, 2, 1

2035
03:22:48,680 --> 03:23:04,680
No one sees me talking out

2036
03:23:04,680 --> 03:23:10,680
A night when the light is no one with the radio

2037
03:23:10,680 --> 03:23:14,680
Your heat's on fire

2038
03:23:26,680 --> 03:23:29,680
Even if you say I have been the worldwide

2039
03:23:29,680 --> 03:23:32,680
I'll take you where surely you have never been

2040
03:23:32,680 --> 03:23:36,680
All right in the fight, I'm okay, come on!

2041
03:23:38,680 --> 03:23:39,680
Come on!

2042
03:23:41,680 --> 03:23:45,680
Hey, do you feel the light? It's miserable

2043
03:23:45,680 --> 03:23:48,680
Because it's always just unbelievable

2044
03:23:48,680 --> 03:23:53,680
No other place is like that in the world, world, world

2045
03:23:54,680 --> 03:23:57,680
No one sleeps in Tokyo

2046
03:23:57,680 --> 03:24:00,680
All night crossing the line

2047
03:24:00,680 --> 03:24:06,680
No one quits the radio Stop your heat from fire

2048
03:24:06,680 --> 03:24:12,680
No one sleeps in Tokyo All night crossing the lane

2049
03:24:12,680 --> 03:24:19,680
No one quits the radio, talk your head from fire

2050
03:24:31,680 --> 03:24:35,680
Turning to the left, you can see the red lights

2051
03:24:35,680 --> 03:24:38,680
And to the right, crazy music everywhere

2052
03:24:38,680 --> 03:24:42,680
All right, in the fight, I'm okay, come on!

2053
03:24:43,680 --> 03:24:45,680
Come on!

2054
03:24:47,680 --> 03:24:50,680
Hey, do you feel the light? It's breathable

2055
03:24:50,680 --> 03:24:53,680
Look at the sun, which is unbelievable

2056
03:24:53,680 --> 03:24:58,680
No other place is like that in the world, world, world

2057
03:24:58,680 --> 03:24:59,680
One, two, three, four

2058
03:24:59,680 --> 03:25:02,680
No one lives in Tokyo

2059
03:25:02,680 --> 03:25:05,680
All night crossing the line

2060
03:25:05,680 --> 03:25:11,680
No one's with the radio, talk your ears on fire

2061
03:25:11,680 --> 03:25:17,680
No one's with the Tokyo, all night crossing the line

2062
03:25:17,680 --> 03:25:25,680
No one's with the radio, don't you hear some fire

2063
03:26:17,680 --> 03:26:19,680
All right.

2064

Unbelievable, no other place is like back in the world, world, world

2065
03:26:54,680 --> 03:27:00,680
No one lives in Tokyo, all night crossing the line

2066
03:27:00,680 --> 03:27:07,680
No one quits the radio, Tokyo is on fire

2067
03:27:07,680 --> 03:27:13,680
No one lives in Tokyo, all night crossing the line

2068
03:27:13,680 --> 03:27:20,680
No one quits the radio, don't you eat the fire

03:28:30,680 --> 03:28:33,680
Nobody knows what my dear foundation

2074

This is the light of the night, the rain of the sun, the sky, the flash of paradise with the rainbow

03:29:37,420 --> 03:29:43,420
The magic story with you, growing up on my broken heart and something dark

And you come on, don't be afraid

2126

Cause you've got me to the bone

Burning me so deep, I'm still in love for more

2128
03:33:45,620 --> 03:33:48,020
More and more to see

2129
03:33:48,020 --> 03:33:51,020
Like a fox in the dark

2130
03:33:51,020 --> 03:33:53,820
Like a fox in the dark

2131
03:33:53,820 --> 03:33:56,620
No matter where we sleep or we fight

2132
03:33:56,620 --> 03:34:00,420
No matter where we suffer, we rise

2133
03:34:00,420 --> 03:34:06,420
Like a fox in the dark

2134
03:34:06,420 --> 03:34:09,420
No matter where we sleep or we cry

2135
03:34:09,420 --> 03:34:12,420
No matter where we love or we ride

2136
03:34:25,420 --> 03:34:28,420
I'll take you to the beach

2137
03:34:28,420 --> 03:34:31,920
Darkest place, baby don't be afraid

2138
03:34:31,920 --> 03:34:36,220
I'll take you in the dark to know the place

2139
03:34:36,220 --> 03:34:40,420
Remember what you said, come on, girl don't leave right

2140
03:34:40,420 --> 03:34:43,420
Cause you got me through the hole

2141
03:34:43,420 --> 03:34:47,920
But it feels so deep, I'm still in love for more

2142
03:34:47,920 --> 03:34:50,420
More, no, please

2143
03:34:50,420 --> 03:34:53,420
Like a fox in the dark

2144
03:34:53,420 --> 03:34:55,920
Like a fox in the dark

2145
03:34:55,920 --> 03:34:58,480
No matter where we sleep or we fart

2146
03:34:58,480 --> 03:35:01,820
No matter where we stop or we run

2147
03:35:02,520 --> 03:35:05,620
Like a spark in the dark

2148
03:35:05,620 --> 03:35:08,460
Like a spark in the dark

2149
03:35:08,460 --> 03:35:10,040
No matter where we sleep or we ever

2150
03:35:10,040 --> 03:35:14,040
No matter where we stop or we run

2151
03:36:10,040 --> 03:36:29,040
Like a bird, like a bird We fight, we run

2152
03:36:29,040 --> 03:36:39,040
Like a bird, like a bird No matter, no matter

2153
03:36:39,040 --> 03:36:42,040
No matter where we go, for we ride

2154
03:37:09,040 --> 03:37:11,040
Ride that bike

2155
03:37:39,040 --> 03:37:56,040
I don't know what I'm doing Maybe it's the time to let me go

2156
03:37:56,040 --> 03:38:02,040
I think too much of you said That our love will never die

2157
03:38:02,040 --> 03:38:20,360
Thanks for watching!
