You

03:30.000 --> 03:42.880
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

03:42.880 --> 03:48.000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio for Monty Talks and Then Some.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.620
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

03:51.620 --> 03:56.280
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

03:56.280 --> 04:02.200
lounge may contain sexual perverted and mildly retarded content you probably

04:02.200 --> 04:06.520

Look you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.280
It's a house? Look!

04:35.280 --> 04:37.280
It's a flesh wound.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.280
Searching for a boy in high school isn't useless.

04:39.280 --> 04:43.280
It's searching for meaning in a polished genre.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.280
Oh yeah?

04:45.280 --> 04:48.280
Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

07:57.660 --> 07:59.160
Now and there, verse attachment

07:59.160 --> 08:00.660
This thing needs a black-and-all way

08:00.660 --> 08:02.660
To put a trigger test above the paint, how do you do today?

08:02.660 --> 08:04.160
Don't get me wrong, I'm a bachelor fist

08:04.160 --> 08:05.660
The mind can't do more than fist

08:05.660 --> 08:07.160
Expose concern on what it takes

08:07.160 --> 08:09.160
You know that terrorists always make these mistakes

08:09.160 --> 08:10.660
What we got is a slow momentum

08:10.660 --> 08:12.160
If you need the right tools and fences

08:12.160 --> 08:13.660
Try the wave, can't count for the rhythm

08:13.660 --> 08:15.160
The marks, the teachers, we gotta get with it

08:15.160 --> 08:16.660
The rain is a generate almighty

08:16.660 --> 08:18.660
For we need to do it higher, master's man, go slower

08:18.660 --> 08:22.660
Yeah, don't really think that far. It's up to you to make that call to drop the bomb.

08:24.660 --> 08:25.660
Yeah, drop the bomb.

08:27.660 --> 08:28.660
Drop the bomb.

08:30.660 --> 08:31.660
Let me see that bomb.

08:35.660 --> 08:39.660
You're still looking for a way that's never been seen before.

08:39.660 --> 08:41.660
Gotta think about what's now to come.

08:42.660 --> 08:43.660
Drop the bomb.

08:44.660 --> 08:45.660
Drop the bomb.

08:45.660 --> 08:52.660
What we gotta do is build momentum, if you need the right tools and venting.

08:52.660 --> 09:01.660
Ride the waves, I'm comfy, the rhythm's the march, the future's begun, get with it.

09:01.660 --> 09:04.660
You're ready to stare at almighty, if I were you to do it now, you're much the same, go slower.

09:04.660 --> 09:08.660
Yeah, you're so ready to take that fall, and it's up to you to make that call.

09:08.660 --> 09:14.160
And if you don't run, make sure you don't bang and wipe it out.

09:14.160 --> 09:17.160
You got the ball

09:17.160 --> 09:20.160
You got the ball

09:20.160 --> 09:22.160
You got the ball

09:22.160 --> 09:29.660
You got the ball

09:29.660 --> 09:32.160
then you got the ball

09:32.160 --> 09:37.160
that ball

09:37.160 --> 09:39.160
You

10:07.160 --> 10:35.160
I'm gonna be your fantasy, it's me I'm gonna be your fantasy, I'm gonna be your fantasy

10:35.160 --> 10:38.780
Your fantasy sticks me ecstasy

11:05.160 --> 11:34.160
Mr. Random person on the street, who by the way is not an actor, what do you think of

11:34.160 --> 11:44.000
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
It's unearthly.

11:45.000 --> 11:51.280
It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.640
Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

11:53.640 --> 12:00.120
Hope you enjoyed the oon, oon, oon, duh, duh, duh, twa, twa, twa, and dropped the bomb

12:00.120 --> 12:01.900
long mix.

12:01.900 --> 12:05.540
The V-Rare album, the brand new one that just came out with DDR Extreme in Japan.

12:05.540 --> 12:07.420
I think you broke the camera with that cookie.

12:07.420 --> 12:07.920
Shut up.

12:07.920 --> 12:14.700
If you're wondering what happened to the Orange Lounge Radio DDR Extreme premiere show,

12:14.700 --> 12:18.140
well, I ordered my copy of Extreme a little later than some of you,

12:18.140 --> 12:19.860
and therefore we won't be getting it until Tuesday.

12:19.860 --> 12:21.140
I had forgot to order mine.

12:21.140 --> 12:23.380
So we won't be doing the show until Wednesday.

12:23.380 --> 12:26.020
Oops, because I'm going to Alabama.

12:26.020 --> 12:26.520
Yeah.

12:26.520 --> 12:28.220
Wait, when do you leave for Alabama?

12:28.220 --> 12:29.260
Next month.

12:29.260 --> 12:29.760
Next month.

12:29.760 --> 12:30.860
We're still a little ways away.

12:30.860 --> 12:35.860
We just did the math though and you're going to be missing episode 69, which makes me cry.

12:35.860 --> 12:39.860
Unless you put us on hiatus.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.860
Put the show on hiatus? Never.

12:42.860 --> 12:45.860
Hey, we want to go to Gotham Land on Sunday.

12:45.860 --> 12:47.860
Well, let's just re-record the show.

12:47.860 --> 12:50.860
No, we don't put the show on hiatus.

12:50.860 --> 12:52.860
Remember those days.

12:52.860 --> 12:54.860
I will take my replacement.

12:54.860 --> 12:56.860
Oh, you're going to hand pick a replacement.

12:56.860 --> 12:59.860
I will take my replacement.

12:59.860 --> 13:03.860
Just be gentle when you're picking.

13:03.860 --> 13:06.860
Just be gentle while you're picking.

13:06.860 --> 13:08.860
Yeah, right.

13:08.860 --> 13:12.860
I'll break out the asbestos gloves.

13:12.860 --> 13:15.860
Yes, I originally had told our chat room earlier in the week.

13:15.860 --> 13:18.860
For those of you guys that lurk in our chat room 24-7,

13:18.860 --> 13:21.860
Get a life! No, just kidding. Just kidding. We love it.

13:21.860 --> 13:25.860
I did say originally Monday because I thought that's what day I was going to get it,

13:25.860 --> 13:28.860
but I actually checked the UPS thing and it's not going to get here until Tuesday

13:28.860 --> 13:32.460
PS is slower than I remember and it takes two days to get here not one so

13:32.460 --> 13:36.060
we are actually gonna be getting on Tuesday but because Jamie show we're not

13:36.060 --> 13:39.540
gonna play until Wednesday so that's when the DDR extreme premiere show will

13:39.540 --> 13:42.860
be will be Wednesday not much of a premiere I know because many of you

13:42.860 --> 13:45.580
have already played it but I know a lot of you guys don't have access to a

13:45.580 --> 13:48.860
Japanese PlayStation twos and maybe you're a little curious about the game

13:48.860 --> 13:53.020
because details have been a little details about the new DDR extreme you

13:53.020 --> 13:56.140
know all the stuff we really want to know about is come out what are they

13:56.140 --> 13:59.580
hidden songs. What do they sound like? What are the non stop courses? They are little

13:59.580 --> 14:04.000
things haven't really been talked about. So we'll be doing that on our webcam as well.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.180
We have the TV hooked up to the webcam. The little things, the cool things, the information

14:09.180 --> 14:13.180
mode things that we can't read, but will be funny anyway, I'm sure.

14:13.180 --> 14:17.020
Yay. You're supposed to promote the program.

14:17.020 --> 14:26.020
Yay. I'm excited. I was poor earlier. I'm ordering my next week because I had to buy

14:26.020 --> 14:31.700
a ticket to see Alan Jackson. Why are you buying a ticket willingly to go to a country

14:31.700 --> 14:38.320
concert? Because my mom wants to go. That's like when I was going to buy my mom a ticket

14:38.320 --> 14:45.080
to see Celine Dion in Vegas. But then I realized I don't want to contribute to that. Your mom

14:45.080 --> 14:50.160
likes Celine Dion. Yeah, my mom loves Celine Dion. You know who else my mom likes? A lot?

14:50.160 --> 15:02.780
Barbra Streisand. And my mom also bought the Rosie O'Donnell Christmas album.

15:02.780 --> 15:09.580
But Celine Dion can't sing for shit. The only good song she did was by Meat Loaf.

15:09.580 --> 15:13.160
Yeah Meat Loaf is cool. Yeah he was Eddie.

15:13.160 --> 15:17.980
I see Marin is in our chat room and she's going to Alabama with you and she says I don't

15:17.980 --> 15:24.980
I'll make you go. I'll buy your damn ticket. Just watch. You're coming to see Alan Jackson

15:24.980 --> 15:29.860
Biloxi with us. I'm probably going to leave her over at Mama Sun's.

15:29.860 --> 15:40.380
Haha, you opened your mouth. Anyway, usually at the top of the show we talk about how was

15:40.380 --> 15:47.660
your day, how was your week, but today I wanted to be a little different.

15:47.660 --> 15:50.660
Let's talk about Orange Lounge Radio Goes to the Movies.

15:50.660 --> 15:51.660
Yay!

15:51.660 --> 15:55.500
Because, while we didn't all go to the movies together this week, in fact, the three of

15:55.500 --> 15:58.840
us went to three separate shows across the weekend.

15:58.840 --> 16:01.180
We all saw the same movie.

16:01.180 --> 16:02.900
And what movie did we see, Jamie?

16:02.900 --> 16:03.900
Kill Bill.

16:03.900 --> 16:05.500
Yes, we saw Kill Bill volume one.

16:05.500 --> 16:06.500
Best movie ever.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.660
So, Jamie, would you like to start with your review of Kill Bill?

16:09.660 --> 16:10.660
Blood!

16:10.660 --> 16:14.380
Remember, we have to keep it spoiler free because we have somebody in the room who hasn't

16:14.380 --> 16:18.740
seen it, for one, and we don't know, our listeners probably haven't seen it, although they should.

16:18.740 --> 16:26.860
It's different blood effects of various types, whether it be CG or liquid, blood in various

16:26.860 --> 16:32.940
colors, oh no CG, but there's still various different types of blood effects, like everything

16:32.940 --> 16:44.700
from the squirt to the splatter to the animated to the blood. It was blood. Lots, lots, lots,

16:44.700 --> 16:50.460
lots of it. Most of the movie was in Japanese. There were puns in the movie. If you don't

16:50.460 --> 16:55.000
really understand Japanese, then you won't get them. I was there laughing in the theater

16:55.000 --> 17:01.140
and people were giving me weird looks. That was great. Then the people in the theater

17:01.140 --> 17:06.420
were funny too. I'm not going to say what the scene was, but there was this one particular

17:06.420 --> 17:11.560
really awesome scene and it gets really quiet and this guy's back is like, whoa, and everybody

17:11.560 --> 17:24.560
busted out. And the whole movie was just fantastic. On a scale of one to ten? Five thousand million.

17:24.560 --> 17:30.440
Which is just one point short of Battle Royale.

17:30.440 --> 17:33.320
Loki what did you think of Kill Bill Volume 1?

17:33.320 --> 17:36.500
I already knew it was going to be good, I already read the script beforehand.

17:36.500 --> 17:37.500
You little pirate.

17:37.500 --> 17:38.500
Arrr.

17:38.500 --> 17:41.500
I didn't pirate the script, it was online.

17:41.500 --> 17:42.500
Whatever.

17:42.500 --> 17:46.520
So how can I be a pirate if it was readily available online?

17:46.520 --> 17:50.600
Was it readily available from Miramax, did Miramax distribute the script or did some

17:50.600 --> 17:53.880
little kid find it and put it out for everybody to download?

17:53.880 --> 17:55.880
Just because it's on the internet doesn't mean it's legal.

17:56.880 --> 17:57.880
I don't know.

17:58.880 --> 18:00.880
It was at moviesource.com.

18:02.880 --> 18:07.880
Anyways, it was good. I liked it. It was everything I thought it was going to be.

18:11.880 --> 18:12.880
On a scale of one to ten?

18:13.880 --> 18:15.880
Oh, that was good. Ten is Oscar material.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.880
I'm sorry. I don't see that ever happening.

18:20.880 --> 18:21.880
Oh, come on. Pulp Fiction.

18:21.880 --> 18:51.680
I think Pulp Fiction has the F-word in it 256 times, and this movie had it maybe...

18:51.680 --> 19:09.600
40. Just because there's not blood. That was a pair of the suckiest throws ever. By the

19:09.600 --> 19:17.400
way, there are two tie-ins, by the way, to Battle Royale, not just one, other than, what

19:17.400 --> 19:24.640
was her name, Kuriyama Chiaki. The chick who plays Chinguisa. You're saying Linguisa, which

19:24.640 --> 19:30.480
is a talent. Chigusa. That's it, sorry. Yes, that's her, but there's another one. In the

19:30.480 --> 19:36.780
animated sequence, the girl's voice actor is Maeda Ai, who played the girl at the very

19:36.780 --> 19:41.320
beginning of Battle Royale with the blood all over her face. Oh, cool. And who is in

19:41.320 --> 19:42.320
battle royale too.

19:42.320 --> 19:43.320
Very cool.

19:43.320 --> 19:53.080
For other anime fans, Midori Kala is in it, you can tell him by his nasally ass voice.

19:53.080 --> 19:58.320
There is an anime sequence, probably about ten minutes long, some of the folks say Ghost

19:58.320 --> 19:59.320
in the Shell, right?

19:59.320 --> 20:08.580
Yeah, it was done by Studio Gonzo.

20:08.580 --> 20:14.420
My review of Kill Bill was, it was, okay this is the interesting thing because every geek

20:14.420 --> 20:17.480
I know just totally fucking loved this movie.

20:17.480 --> 20:20.060
Like I've been reading Live Journal over the weekend and stuff and all my geek friends

20:20.060 --> 20:23.580
who saw it was like, this is the coolest movie ever.

20:23.580 --> 20:27.660
Because it's an homage, it pays homage to everything geek.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.760
It is just like a tribute to everything geek.

20:30.760 --> 20:36.340
Like it is, and this is the thing is that Tarantino is a fan of like everything that

20:36.340 --> 20:37.940
we talk about on this show.

20:37.940 --> 20:41.260
when I was watching the movie I knew Jamie was just gonna be wet watching

20:41.260 --> 20:45.340
this movie because I could see all these influences from like all of her favorite

20:45.340 --> 20:49.020
things that she never shuts up about like battle royale and the anime and all

20:49.020 --> 20:52.180
that stuff so I just was like oh Jamie's gonna be loving this when she sees it

20:52.180 --> 20:55.580
and I really loved it too because I like all that stuff too and and the blood was

20:55.580 --> 21:01.780
great and what

21:01.780 --> 21:09.620
I'm just faking. Yeah, I was just thinking that too. That was one of the best, I don't

21:09.620 --> 21:14.780
want to spoil it, but that was the best thing in the whole movie. And the pussy wagon. The

21:14.780 --> 21:19.080
pussy wagon. Okay, that's it, that's it. I won't say anything else. On a scale of one

21:19.080 --> 21:29.780
to ten, what? On a scale of one to ten, I give it a ten point one. I win. Fifteen million.

21:29.780 --> 21:33.780
Does Bradley have anything you want to say about Kill Bill?

21:33.780 --> 21:37.780
Yes, it was cool. I enjoyed it.

21:37.780 --> 21:41.780
I don't know, I can't really add anything because people say it the most.

21:41.780 --> 21:45.780
I was kind of sitting there.

21:45.780 --> 21:49.780
So I gave it a 10 because it was really cool.

21:49.780 --> 21:53.780
Andrew, I know you haven't seen it, but what would you give it on a scale of 1 to 10?

21:53.780 --> 21:57.780
Based on what Jamie goes...

21:57.780 --> 22:01.580
million and if everyone in this room gives me a dollar I can go see it how

22:01.580 --> 22:05.820
about no but you know what boo we'll give you those sucky cookies to sell on

22:05.820 --> 22:08.100
ebay

22:17.180 --> 22:20.420
damn am I the only person knows how to throw a microphone were you guys gonna

22:20.420 --> 22:25.340

22:31.980 --> 22:36.780
tonight we're going to see Kill Bill again after the show we'll go catch 10 o'clock showing in

22:36.780 --> 22:45.980
Fulton or something oh well we'll figure something out maybe later you wanna go do you wanna go after

22:45.980 --> 22:50.460
the show okay I have to see it three more times okay we'll go see it you know I only saw Freddy

22:50.460 --> 23:04.640
If I really like a movie, then, see, four is my favorite number.

23:04.640 --> 23:05.640
Okay.

23:05.640 --> 23:10.360
This is where my small bit of obsessive compulsive disorder sneaks in.

23:10.360 --> 23:14.600
If I really like a movie, I either have to see it twice or four times in a theater.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.800
If I really dig the movie, it's four times.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.160
How many times did I see Harry Potter?

23:18.160 --> 23:19.160
Four times.

23:19.160 --> 23:20.160
And you were there for one of them.

23:20.160 --> 23:23.340
for one of them. I was there for number two, I think. No, it doesn't, number three. Oh,

23:23.340 --> 23:25.380
was it number three? You were there for number three. That's good, because I don't like being

23:25.380 --> 23:32.620
number two. But I have to, if I really like a movie, then I go see it multiple times.

23:32.620 --> 23:38.740
But then again, I've already seen it twice. You know what I'm thinking? The most number

23:38.740 --> 23:42.900
of times, not counting Rocky Horror Picture Show, that's an exception obviously, but not

23:42.900 --> 23:46.140
counting Rocky Horror Picture Show, the most number of times I've seen a movie in the theater

23:46.140 --> 23:53.280
is three. I saw Titanic three times in the theater. Dork. Just don't ask. I got dragged

23:53.280 --> 23:58.320
by different people. I saw Shakespeare in Love three times in the theater. I think I

23:58.320 --> 24:05.020
need to see Kill Bill four times. This started back with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

24:05.020 --> 24:09.880
movie. Which I've seen in the theater four times. Did you see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

24:09.880 --> 24:16.560
two The Secret of the Ooze four times? I saw it twice. I saw the third one twice as well.

24:16.560 --> 24:21.640
The third one was cool. The third one was just neat. The third one was cool. Shut up.

24:21.640 --> 24:30.240
I've seen Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey four times in the theater. I've seen Harry Potter

24:30.240 --> 24:34.800
and Chamber of Secrets four times in the theater. I wasn't into Harry Potter when the first

24:34.800 --> 24:41.800
movie came out. I've seen Freddy vs. Jason twice. I've seen, there was one movie I saw

24:44.520 --> 24:47.600
six times in the theater and I forgot what it was just because I kept having to go with

24:47.600 --> 24:53.040
people and I didn't like the movie but that doesn't fall into my rating system. Titanic.

24:53.040 --> 24:58.680
I've seen The Matrix twice in the theater. Well, anyway, I thought we could all give

24:58.680 --> 25:04.360
our little review on it. Andrew, just go with us. We'll cover you somehow. I'll help you.

25:04.360 --> 25:11.440
take pity on your poor pathetic soul. You can get into an R rated movie all by yourself

25:11.440 --> 25:21.040
now, huh? Yay! How does it feel to be a big boy? Andrew will you stand up and pose on

25:21.040 --> 25:26.000
our webcam real fast? I want to read your shirt. I swear it is like reading a novel

25:26.000 --> 25:31.320
right here. Stan, you don't read many books, do you? Shut up. I'm going to read this for

25:31.320 --> 25:35.080
you guys who can't see it on the cam because it's kind of blurry. It says, Mom, Dad, I'm

25:35.080 --> 25:39.200
so sorry. I know you told me not to have anybody in the house while you were away, but when

25:39.200 --> 25:43.220
my friends stopped by, I had to let them in. It wasn't planned or anything. I certainly

25:43.220 --> 25:48.440
wouldn't call it a party. Honestly, I have no idea how the band got here or why the police

25:48.440 --> 25:52.560
were called. I'm really, really sorry about the house, but that's why we have insurance,

25:52.560 --> 25:56.560
How many times do you get stopped so people can read that shirt?

25:56.560 --> 26:00.560
More times when people stop to talk to me.

26:00.560 --> 26:04.560
Is that your way of getting attention?

26:04.560 --> 26:08.560
We need to get him the shirt that you got me.

26:08.560 --> 26:12.560
I hate my life.

26:12.560 --> 26:16.560
Every day I polish my revolver and I shoot my head like a rock star.

26:16.560 --> 26:20.840
This 80 year old lady stopped me in the grocery store to read my shirt and said it was the

26:20.840 --> 26:27.400
funniest thing she's ever seen in her life.

26:27.400 --> 26:30.600
That that.

26:30.600 --> 26:36.000
And then while the rest of us are at Scandia lamenting it.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.880
Evil place.

26:39.880 --> 26:42.480
Why should we go to ARC for DDR?

26:42.480 --> 26:46.080
You're like one of the only people that sticks up for this little community college with

26:46.080 --> 26:50.660
DDR machine and I have no interest in going to college to play DDR but I'm

26:50.660 --> 26:54.680
curious to hear why you love it so much. It's cheap, it's loud, they've got all the

26:54.680 --> 26:58.900
unlocks, it's in perfect condition, they keep it in perfect condition. If it isn't

26:58.900 --> 27:03.240
in perfect condition I damn well beat their asses for it. Like okay somebody

27:03.240 --> 27:08.520
fix it had now. You know what they need to do? They need to put DDR machines next to

27:08.520 --> 27:13.580
military drafting boards you know just like that would be the ultimate

27:13.580 --> 27:20.400
ultimate military idea. Why? Get stupid nerdy people in there, trick them into going there

27:20.400 --> 27:30.020
and then they're in the military. You're going to basic trick maniac them into the military.

27:30.020 --> 27:35.100
That was really dumb, really dumb. I just brought this show to a screeching halt, amazing.

27:35.100 --> 27:40.060
You know, I'm sure you would probably say that you pulled a magus, but I can't do that.

27:40.060 --> 27:45.180
it would sound better in portuguese especially since someone took your toilet your i'm sorry

27:45.180 --> 27:51.180
your joke book so that they could wipe their ass if anyone's been keeping up with my board hello

27:52.540 --> 27:57.580
would you like to give your board a plug yes it needs to be plugged into a wall to have some life

27:57.580 --> 28:03.180
in it i posted on your board this week yeah and the puzzle pirate said that nobody reads

28:03.180 --> 28:05.180
Hey, I read it and

28:05.420 --> 28:09.460
It's real play that dark Sakura calm. There's no www in front of it

28:09.460 --> 28:13.680
So don't be stupid and put it in front of there. Just real play dark Sakura calm

28:13.680 --> 28:17.100
It's that easy sign up for it become one with the nerdiness

28:18.900 --> 28:20.860
All right, let's move into how was your week

28:20.860 --> 28:24.820
How was your day because I want to hear how you guys this week in your day was so Jamie. How was your week?

28:24.820 --> 28:26.820
How was your day week sucked?

28:26.820 --> 28:37.180
I had like a really bad night within the week, which was alleviated by some strategically

28:37.180 --> 28:43.540
IM'd cat pictures.

28:43.540 --> 28:46.380
I was just really kind of crappy all week.

28:46.380 --> 28:50.060
I had a really good day Friday, and then I was really disappointed because Dan's like,

28:50.060 --> 28:56.740
I don't want to go to the movie, so I was like, well fine.

28:56.740 --> 29:00.860
Basically what happened Friday, okay last week was customer service week all week which

29:00.860 --> 29:06.100
is kind of neat and Thursday was what is your favorite decade day so I dressed all 80s it

29:06.100 --> 29:12.220
was great and played Duran Duran in my cubicle all day.

29:12.220 --> 29:20.860
And then Thursday, not Thursday but Friday, they fed us spaghetti.

29:20.860 --> 29:24.500
My supervisor cooked it and she makes really good spaghetti.

29:24.500 --> 29:28.180
And then I get home and I'm like, okay, Dan, we're gonna go see Kill Bill, right?

29:28.180 --> 29:30.020
And he's like, uh, I cooked you dinner.

29:30.500 --> 29:31.780
Oh, how nice.

29:32.700 --> 29:33.620
He cooked spaghetti.

29:34.740 --> 29:35.900
So that's spaghetti twice.

29:38.140 --> 29:42.900
And so I, I, you know, I went to the, to the store and bought like some garlic

29:42.900 --> 29:45.660
bread and some real Parmesan cheese.

29:46.940 --> 29:48.140
So it made it better.

29:48.140 --> 29:49.340
You don't like the powder Parmesan cheese.

29:49.340 --> 29:50.220
You have to have the actual,

29:50.540 --> 29:53.060
Now that since I've had real Parmesan cheese, I have to have

29:53.060 --> 29:57.420
real parmesan cheese every time and I'm such a snob when it comes to what I put

29:57.420 --> 30:04.260
on my food but only half my cheese elitist bite my ass I'll show you cheese

30:04.260 --> 30:12.540
anyway I you know I would have eat I would not have eaten that cookie if I

30:12.540 --> 30:18.820
had known what it was to begin with that cookie deceived me that cookie is can

30:18.820 --> 30:23.020
you can you provide our listeners with a little bit of backstory on the cookies

30:53.020 --> 30:59.700
are turning purple. Anyway, don't you see, you're getting retarded. I love you, you love

30:59.700 --> 31:16.700
me. There's nothing to throw, finish your story. No, do not throw the cookie you suck.

31:16.700 --> 31:45.440
We get to the checkout counter at Walmart and I am delighted and thrilled to see oatmeal

31:45.440 --> 32:04.280
cream cookies on the little Debbie Snack Bar.

32:04.280 --> 32:09.520
I grabbed the box, and I hugged the box as excited as I am, and I freakin'...

32:09.520 --> 32:10.520
She did.

32:10.520 --> 32:11.520
I was there.

32:11.520 --> 32:12.520
I fucked...

32:12.520 --> 32:13.520
I fucked...

32:13.520 --> 32:16.520
You fucked the box.

32:16.520 --> 32:19.760
I forked over the money for this...

32:19.760 --> 32:21.960
You're eating bacon bits out of the box?

32:21.960 --> 32:22.960
My God.

32:22.960 --> 32:24.960
No, you're sorry.

32:24.960 --> 32:29.600
Anyway, I forked over the money to get this thing of oatmeal cream pie thing.

32:29.600 --> 32:30.600
Get in the car.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.600
I'm halfway through the cookie, mind you.

32:32.600 --> 32:40.220
these things are too chewy these things suck I can't taste the cream oh my god

32:40.220 --> 32:44.600
it's marshmallow ew and then we look at the box and reduce fat and I'm like oh

32:44.600 --> 32:52.280
well shit so I gave one to I had Rob eat one and Rob agrees with me that they're

32:52.280 --> 32:57.860
the worst cookies ever right sucks so we decided that we were going to come back

32:57.860 --> 33:04.860
make everybody else eat them. And we've been successful so far.

33:05.060 --> 33:10.060
This reminds me, there's one part in Kill Bill where there's a cereal box called Kaboom.

33:10.060 --> 33:16.060
I remembered it from when I was like 5 to 10 years old.

33:16.060 --> 33:19.060
I know. I hated that cereal.

33:19.060 --> 33:24.740
We grabbed it one day and it was the worst cereal I've ever tasted. So we took one bite

33:24.740 --> 33:31.580
and we basically threw out the box and that was the throwback.

33:31.580 --> 33:37.100
They need to make shirts with old cereal boxes on them like Mr. T cereal.

33:37.100 --> 33:43.620
I want a shirt with Mr. T cereal on the front or the Nintendo Breakfast System.

33:43.620 --> 33:51.540
Like, it's for breakfast now.

33:51.540 --> 34:07.500
is it I feel really old yeah you were still it was earlier than that okay

34:07.940 --> 34:16.140
anyway nobody can hear what you're saying anyway so shut up anyway as you

34:16.140 --> 34:20.980
know what I've noticed so many things from when I was younger are making a big

34:20.980 --> 34:26.620
comeback now you know like you know they're doing all the re-releases of

34:26.620 --> 34:32.540
Transformers. I have my season 3 box set now and so in the first half of it I

34:32.540 --> 34:37.620
watched the worst episode of Transformers in history next to carnage

34:37.620 --> 34:42.380
in C minor or major whatever it was. You know what? It's the Starscream Ghost episode for

34:42.380 --> 34:45.840
season 3 and it's the worst episode ever. You said everything from your youth is

34:45.840 --> 34:50.140
making a comeback right that's because they say like things cycle in 20 year

34:50.140 --> 34:54.020
cycles like in the 80s 60s things were popular again and here we are in the

34:54.020 --> 34:58.900
year 2000 and the 80s stuff is making a comeback because it's 20 years ago so

34:58.900 --> 35:02.180
like all the stuff my child has been you come back just think in 20 years DDR is

35:02.180 --> 35:10.780
gonna make a comeback remember that retro geeky dancing game we all used to

35:10.780 --> 35:19.740
play technically didn't we dance aerobics man that dance aerobics game

35:19.740 --> 35:26.420
was the shit sorry dinner well now we're getting what aerobics revolution is that

35:26.420 --> 35:30.140
in Japan now I think so yeah

35:30.140 --> 35:32.140
I have spirits.

35:34.140 --> 35:36.140
You know, it got quiet.

35:36.140 --> 35:38.140
Well, are you done with your story?

35:38.140 --> 35:40.140
I was telling a story.

35:40.140 --> 35:41.140
Oops.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.140
I got sidetracked, sorry.

35:44.140 --> 35:46.140
It's alright.

35:46.140 --> 35:47.140
That happens all the time.

35:47.140 --> 35:48.140
Whose turn is it?

35:48.140 --> 35:49.140
Uh, Loki's.

35:49.140 --> 35:51.140
Here you go, bacon breath.

35:52.140 --> 35:54.140
Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

35:54.140 --> 35:56.140
Almost bacon breath.

35:56.140 --> 35:57.140
Good.

35:57.140 --> 35:58.140
It was a bacon breath.

35:58.140 --> 36:07.140
Yeah, Bake O'Breath. My week was good. I finished both DDR pads. They're done. Thank God. I'm so glad to be done with those.

36:08.740 --> 36:26.620
And so I finished those. I had to kind of actually, they were finished last night very late. I had to do a really ghetto job on one of the panels because I lost one of the corner pieces somehow. And so there's a nice little square metal piece holding one of the panels. And I see it.

36:26.620 --> 36:33.620
it's a square mending bracket but anyways I started this morning or

36:33.620 --> 36:39.900
afternoon I started my cabinet so by estimates it shouldn't take too long to

36:39.900 --> 36:43.580
do probably about a week or two and it'll be done because I'm already you

36:43.580 --> 36:51.660
know almost finished drawing up the first the first the hell

36:52.180 --> 36:55.180
yeah

36:55.180 --> 37:06.180
Okay, anyways, um, yeah, I'm almost done drawing up the first, um, whole, uh, sheet of, um, particle board.

37:06.180 --> 37:09.180
And there's actually only three that make up the cabinet, so, yeah, hey!

37:09.180 --> 37:12.180
One sixth of the way done, so, yay!

37:12.180 --> 37:14.180
And that would only take a couple hours.

37:14.180 --> 37:20.180
So, um, probably shouldn't take too long, and we'll be having a arcade cabinet where the TV is now.

37:20.180 --> 37:22.180
Enjoy!

37:22.180 --> 37:26.180
Hey, don't be knocking it, you know you'll enjoy it.

37:26.180 --> 37:30.180
Fucking break out the old school games and stuff.

37:30.180 --> 37:35.180
Anyway, then yesterday we went down the golf land and played a bunch of F-Zero because there's no one playing it.

37:35.180 --> 37:41.180
And there was a bunch of other people playing DDR and some retard unplugged the machine when we were trying to play it.

37:41.180 --> 37:44.180
Fuckers.

37:44.180 --> 37:47.180
What else? Oh, not too much.

37:47.180 --> 37:49.180
I hear Drummania is broken again.

37:49.180 --> 37:50.180
Actually, it was.

37:50.180 --> 37:57.180
It was in police call attendant mode, so as soon as Keith gets back there on Monday, I'll be fine again.

37:57.180 --> 37:58.180
Then what else?

37:58.180 --> 38:02.180
Oh, during the week sucked and didn't do a whole lot other than see Kill Bill.

38:02.180 --> 38:04.180
That was cool.

38:04.180 --> 38:05.180
Yeah, that's it.

38:05.180 --> 38:10.180
Not too much.

38:10.180 --> 38:15.180
Okay, let's talk to Andrew.

38:15.180 --> 38:18.180
Andrew, how was your week? How was your day?

38:19.180 --> 38:22.180
Weak, exhausting. Day to suck.

38:24.180 --> 38:29.180
Just day after day after day of college, which is absolutely tiring.

38:31.180 --> 38:34.180
And we'll get to that in a little bit in the FUs.

38:36.180 --> 38:38.180
Today I just sat around, played Ragnarok.

38:39.180 --> 38:42.180
Actually leveled a couple of times, which is getting harder and harder, but...

38:42.180 --> 38:57.500
figure it all balances out. That's about it. I just got bored and decided to come here.

38:57.500 --> 39:01.300
You know, I've actually considered getting back into Ragnarok lately, but I decided to

39:01.300 --> 39:06.500
start Final Fantasy X again. No, Ragnarok.

39:06.500 --> 39:10.420
Not until I finish Final Fantasy X. I'll tank your alkaline. Play Ragnarok.

39:10.420 --> 39:16.580
wait are you on are you on uh loki server i play on all three servers

39:20.260 --> 39:24.180
i have to play on chaos so i can take you out with my assassin and gain you like

39:24.180 --> 39:34.820
what 10 20 levels in an hour i can do that um no not until i finish final fantasy 10 because i i

39:34.820 --> 39:39.380
started final fantasy 10 some time ago like about a year and a half no it was about a year ago

39:39.380 --> 39:44.660
was when I was with my ex, it was a year ago, and I started it and I never finished it.

39:44.660 --> 39:48.620
I only got about 10 hours into it, and so last week after the show, I picked it up again

39:48.620 --> 39:52.680
and I said, I'm bored, I need something to do. So I'm like, okay, I'm going to play Final

39:52.680 --> 39:56.060
Fantasy X, I'm going to play it, I'm going to beat it. I need to restart the international

39:56.060 --> 40:01.780
one. And in this one week, I'm already past where I was last time. I just got past that

40:01.780 --> 40:06.300
point today. You want to know what's going to be scary? The international version is

40:06.300 --> 40:14.820
easier so if I get started playing I'll catch up to you yes I know Final Fantasy

40:14.820 --> 40:21.500
10 is so 2002 so what I'm a late bloomer I'm retro and you know what on with

40:21.500 --> 40:28.060
Final Fantasy 10 to coming out pretty soon you know it'll it means the story

40:28.060 --> 40:31.940
will be fresh in my mind ever been to the GameStop and Arden from all that was

40:31.940 --> 40:41.700
my DVD in the machine. Remember that crappy DVD I picked up last time you were here? That's

40:41.700 --> 40:44.940
the DVD that's been selling all the pre-orders at Arden-Ferrall.

40:44.940 --> 40:51.180
Yeah, that's cool. Whatever works. Yeah, so my DVD, my piece of shit DVD went

40:51.180 --> 40:55.580
to a good use. Good deal. Let's hear from Bradley. How was

40:55.580 --> 41:01.780
your day? How was your week? Well, most of my week was spent looking at

41:01.780 --> 41:08.420
for a job type thing, working on my cover letter and trying a few things and waiting

41:08.420 --> 41:18.220
for what was the final word on that job I interviewed last week for. Finally they got

41:18.220 --> 41:25.620
back to me and said I didn't get it on Thursday. On that same day I got a one day job for Friday

41:25.620 --> 41:33.160
I just went in and on Friday I went up and typed in a bunch of names and addresses and

41:33.160 --> 41:40.160
phone and fax numbers for a mailing list type thing for testing software, basically like

41:40.160 --> 41:45.280
one of those Excel access, all those type testing programs.

41:45.280 --> 41:52.320
I could have been able to list, they might have just told me wrong.

41:52.320 --> 41:57.120
Let's do a woman in there talking about the governator over and over again to various

41:57.120 --> 42:00.800
people on the phone.

42:00.800 --> 42:01.800
Hear grumbling in the background.

42:01.800 --> 42:02.800
It's over.

42:02.800 --> 42:03.800
Let's not talk about it anymore.

42:03.800 --> 42:04.800
Those aren't even real bakos.

42:04.800 --> 42:05.800
No, they're fakos.

42:05.800 --> 42:06.800
They're bacon flavored chips brand bacon things.

42:06.800 --> 42:07.800
With no MSG.

42:07.800 --> 42:08.800
Yeah, they are.

42:08.800 --> 42:09.800
Sorry.

42:09.800 --> 42:10.800
That's okay.

42:10.800 --> 42:11.800
I might have kind of edited them.

42:11.800 --> 42:12.800
Let's see.

42:12.800 --> 42:16.800
faking things. With no MSG.

42:16.820 --> 42:20.820
Sorry.

42:20.840 --> 42:24.840
It's my job to make the random side comments.

42:24.860 --> 42:28.860
Spend time putting stuff on eBay because I need to get money

42:28.880 --> 42:32.880
fast before I run out.

42:32.900 --> 42:36.900
And let's see, on Saturday I got invited out to

42:36.920 --> 42:40.920
go seek a bill via one of

42:40.920 --> 42:46.240
one person for people to know, Neil, but he invited me out and said that he paid for it.

42:46.240 --> 42:51.440
But then I drove out all the way out to Fairfield, so that cost about the same amount as a ticket.

42:51.440 --> 42:57.440
But I actually had gas, I didn't have the kind of money to actually pay for that, in

42:57.440 --> 42:59.040
my wallet at the time.

42:59.040 --> 43:05.360
So we saw that, and ate at the only Chick-fil-A in North Carolina, in Northern California

43:05.360 --> 43:06.360
for you.

43:06.360 --> 43:07.360
Chick-fil-A is awesome.

43:07.360 --> 43:08.360
Yes.

43:08.360 --> 43:09.360
And they're closed on Sundays.

43:09.360 --> 43:13.280
and they're closed on Sundays yeah have that eaten there for like a year and a half

43:14.240 --> 43:20.880
Chick-fil-a is the best chicken fast food chain ever you can only get chicks no I take that back

43:20.880 --> 43:24.560
because there's a Chick-fil-a restaurant in Mobile but usually you know places I've ever

43:24.560 --> 43:30.000
seen them or in malls and apparently the owner of the company is you know super Christian and

43:30.000 --> 43:35.600
they're always close on Sunday but they have the best chicken yes that's very good and Polynesian

43:35.600 --> 43:45.600
No one can hear what you're saying.

43:45.600 --> 43:47.600
That's a good thing.

43:47.600 --> 43:48.600
Continue please.

43:48.600 --> 43:58.600
Alright and today just put more stuff up on eBay.

43:58.600 --> 44:04.600
I don't need to figure out. I need to have a plan of action for looking for jobs really fast.

44:04.600 --> 44:08.600
Food, food, food, food, food, food, food.

44:08.600 --> 44:11.600
Basically, that's all.

44:11.600 --> 44:13.600
Now everyone's asleep.

44:13.600 --> 44:16.600
Wake up, wake up!

44:16.600 --> 44:19.600
All right, I'll take over then, because I haven't talked about my week and my day,

44:19.600 --> 44:23.600
and I know everybody wants to hear about my week and my day.

44:23.600 --> 44:30.640
I actually did pay some money this week on Friday. I had some tokens left so I went by Roseville Golf Land and played two games of

44:31.640 --> 44:36.280
two games of guitar freaks and one game of VDR, but then I failed on

44:37.040 --> 44:39.520
Twilight Zone because I forgot to turn off the

44:40.920 --> 44:43.040
shuffle and just failed right at the end.

44:44.880 --> 44:46.880
Okay, there you go.

44:47.480 --> 44:49.480
Okay, my week and my day.

44:49.480 --> 44:53.600
For my week, I didn't do a whole lot of exciting stuff.

44:53.600 --> 44:58.760
I played a lot of Final Fantasy X and they did a lot of napping.

44:58.760 --> 45:04.800
Vanilla Sky on Monday was great, of course.

45:04.800 --> 45:09.880
I went out to Golf Land on Thursday and I played some DDR and some S-Zero and I also

45:09.880 --> 45:13.360
did Last Night, Saturday Night.

45:13.360 --> 45:18.720
I don't really like going to Golf Land on the weekends because I run into too many people

45:18.720 --> 45:23.560
are in line and stuff. I like seeing some of the people in the DDR community that I

45:23.560 --> 45:27.240
don't get to see very often. That was cool because I saw one guy I don't get to see very

45:27.240 --> 45:37.940
often. And then I see some good faces and that's cool. But then there's just a lot of

45:37.940 --> 45:46.340
those like just people to get in the way. So I don't like that on Saturday and all the

45:46.340 --> 45:52.020
you know the guy and their girlfriend that are trying to play DDR for the first time

45:52.020 --> 45:56.620
because it's cute and stuff like that and I guess I should stop being so elitist because

45:56.620 --> 46:00.940
that's how we all get into DDR at one point but I just don't like waiting is what it boils

46:00.940 --> 46:06.540
down to so you know get out of my way I want to play. So that's why Thursdays are always

46:06.540 --> 46:12.220
better for TDR. Friday night was supposed to be this great night where we were going to go see the

46:12.220 --> 46:16.380
movie and we were going to go out dancing and we were going to get our slut on but it didn't happen

46:16.380 --> 46:20.860
we just went to the movie and then went to eat and then we went home. We ended up going out because

46:20.860 --> 46:24.460
we were all lazy and my friend at work is going to kill me because we were supposed to meet her out

46:24.460 --> 46:30.060
Saturday night and we flaked. Yes, Billy was supposed to come back last night. My sister Billy

46:30.060 --> 46:35.900
was supposed to be here yeah my sister billy uh was supposed to be here yesterday but he didn't

46:35.900 --> 46:41.020
come back and i think a sheep ate him because he lives in chico and all they have up there is sheep

46:42.300 --> 46:50.860
um and that was pretty much my day in my week because i did uh napping final fantasy 10

46:50.860 --> 46:58.780
some ddr some f0 and kill bill that was pretty much it and jamie's destroying the kitchen

46:58.780 --> 47:02.940
So I think now is a good time for us to take a break. We're going to take a break and we're

47:02.940 --> 47:06.220
going to come back and I don't know what you guys want to do when we come back. We'll do a

47:06.220 --> 47:11.500
cage match, FUs of the Week, we'll talk about more stuff. What? All right. We're going to do the FUs

47:11.500 --> 47:16.380
of the Week when we come back so if you want to send your FUs of the Week to me, Sky, in the chat

47:23.100 --> 47:27.340

47:27.340 --> 47:34.260
bit longer in this break we're going to do yes it's longer and harder no we're

47:34.260 --> 47:39.460
going to do the 80s do it right electro there I'm sorry the electro extended mix

47:39.460 --> 47:42.620

47:42.620 --> 47:47.460
good break song so after this we'll be back with the F years of the week

Even if your love isn't left for you

52:48.320 --> 52:51.820
It's a play for you, it's a show about hand in line

52:51.820 --> 53:18.140
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?

53:20.140 --> 53:22.140
No!

53:22.140 --> 53:24.140
Do we care what people think of us?

53:24.140 --> 53:26.140
No!

53:26.140 --> 53:28.140
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

54:02.740 --> 54:07.700
goddamn cookies where they like just totally don't even taste right

54:07.700 --> 54:20.700
It's like eating reduced fat ice cream. What's the point?

54:20.700 --> 54:34.340
But you know, ice cream is good. If you're going to eat ice cream, you know what?

54:34.340 --> 54:39.180
The only beer that Orange Lounge Radio endorses would be Guinness, by the way, if you're curious.

54:39.180 --> 54:44.380
I was going to say the only beer that we endorse is Guinness.

54:44.380 --> 54:53.380
And why do we like Guinness so much, Jamie?

54:53.380 --> 55:00.380
yeah

55:00.640 --> 55:01.900
uh...

55:01.900 --> 55:03.900
Are you ready to do the F.E.'s of the week, Jamie?

55:31.900 --> 55:34.900
This is Bob Don.

55:39.900 --> 55:41.900
This is Bob Don.

55:46.900 --> 55:48.900
This is Bob Don.

55:51.900 --> 55:55.900
Oh, this is bad. This is bad.

56:25.900 --> 56:32.900
No, it wasn't. Everyone just missed everything I said, didn't they?

56:32.900 --> 56:33.900
I was just gonna say...

56:33.900 --> 56:34.900
I can start over!

56:34.900 --> 56:36.900
Okay. Um, I said...

56:36.900 --> 56:37.900
Do you want me to start the music over?

56:37.900 --> 56:43.900
No. I said thank you people at Walmart for leaving, um, your, uh, for not taking responsibility for your cart.

56:43.900 --> 56:48.900
When you pull out your cart, you need to put it back up. It's really inconsiderate to leave it in people's way.

56:48.900 --> 56:53.900
Um, and then I said about parents. Fuck all of them. Well, most of them.

56:53.900 --> 57:04.460
Especially if you decide that, you know, I want to have a kid and then you don't put any thought into the responsibilities involved with having the kid.

57:05.340 --> 57:07.540
You need to take responsibility for yourself.

57:07.820 --> 57:18.820
And then, oh my God, the people who blame everybody else for problems that they cause, you know, you need to, people need to learn how to take responsibility for themselves, for their own actions.

57:18.820 --> 57:24.240
you know you can't believe everything that you see on TV you can't believe

57:24.240 --> 57:27.600
everything that you read you need to learn how to think for yourself and so

57:27.600 --> 57:33.160
that's everybody okay I'm really tired of people not everybody everybody in this

57:33.160 --> 57:40.720
room is in the cool book so dangerous you're in the lukewarm book um fuck

57:40.720 --> 57:44.140
Corona cuz it sucks but it's not as bad as that pale ale that I'm making Rob

57:44.140 --> 57:55.600
drinks and really I can't think of anything else cuz what else was I was

57:55.600 --> 57:59.260
like going off without today Rob and when I was going off in the parking lot

57:59.260 --> 58:06.080
at Walmart I swear my best step is when I'm not on the show I don't remember

58:06.080 --> 58:25.080
Fuck mages in Ragnarok, for stealing, for kill stealing, and then fuck glassheim for not bringing me the things to kill fast enough so that I can level faster because I have the archer and I can snipe off the wall.

58:25.080 --> 58:27.080
And then...

58:30.080 --> 58:35.080
Fuck me for buying stupid things that nobody wants to buy because I was up to 800,000 zenny.

58:35.080 --> 58:38.080
And then I bought a bunch of stuff and then no one's buying it.

58:38.080 --> 58:42.080
I made poison belts. I'm selling them for four times what they want.

58:43.080 --> 58:45.080
Um, but that's about it.

58:47.080 --> 58:50.080
Alright, we're gonna go to Loki who has to explain his new music.

58:50.080 --> 58:53.080
It's in theme with the show.

58:55.080 --> 58:57.080
I like it. It goes.

59:02.080 --> 59:04.080
Some choking here.

59:04.080 --> 59:05.080
Okay.

59:06.080 --> 59:10.080
First nephew of the week is going to go to stupid drivers.

59:12.080 --> 59:14.080
More particularly, old people.

59:14.080 --> 59:16.080
I don't like you and you drive too slow.

59:16.080 --> 59:21.640
slow and cutting in front of me and then driving so really pisses me off and

59:21.640 --> 59:25.960
you're lucky that I don't have a gun because I would probably do a drive-by

59:25.960 --> 59:31.560
as I'm passing you but um says I don't I can't do that all I can do is just get

59:31.560 --> 59:35.080
angry and give you glaring look

59:37.240 --> 59:45.960
also f you two or fucking neighbors okay can't park their truck worth a shit hey

59:45.960 --> 59:52.040
yesterday yesterday I tried to pull out of our space and the guys over the line

59:52.040 --> 59:57.200
like I practically have like squeeze through the get in there

59:57.200 --> 01:00:04.140
meanwhile they're getting high out in front of their house also lucky is

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:09.060
stupid people at golf land there's some kid that like went and jumped up on the

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:12.760
pad and started tapping dumb buttons really hard while I was like installing

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:16.640
and then left and I didn't even give a shit at all I just didn't even look at

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:20.200
him didn't even get angry just pretend that it never happened that's just a

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:26.200
moth and that was funny and then um fuck you too uh

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:31.080
oh shit I don't know um the fact that I don't have any food in the fridge that

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:37.400
ate it all oh no I don't want the cracker so I'm eating uh potatoes that

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:44.960
are kind of going bad if it can go bad but anyways and then um let's see what

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:49.080
else I don't know I don't really have too much

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:53.880
fuck you the stupid VDR pads over at the theater because they were slippery as

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:57.560
hell I nearly killed myself on those just

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:02.560
playing normal songs not anything hard if I played anything hard probably blood

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:13.480
all over the pads which is unsweet. And then finally, just F.E. to Yahoo News because you

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:19.280
report on this really dumbest shit. Also an F.E. to British Scientists because don't you

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:24.400
have anything better to do than to test to see if a cookie crumbles and shit like that?

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:31.080
Stupid Brits. They're so dumb. No, it's all about budgeting. They start running out of

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:35.240
money for funding so they have to do stupid experiments so that they can keep their budget

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:43.720
oh actually finally fuck you to the ria once again actually more it's not really the ria

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:50.760
but mainly um well anyways let me uh just give a backstory to this about a week or two ago there

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:58.200
was um an announcement of this new copy protection for this cd or whatever there's some loser band

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:05.720
put out probably country anyways and so it got put out and then people found out

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:10.520
they can get past the cop protection by holding down the shift key well that was

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:15.680
pretty dumb of them now wasn't it anyway so you know a few weeks later this kid

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:21.500
in college writes on his web page basically it kind of like a little essay

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:25.720
or a term paper type thing about you know copy protection and he mentioned

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:30.920
on that how you can bypass that. One company didn't like that that they posted that on

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:40.480
his site, so they're suing him. Meanwhile, Yahoo! reports this, ok, reports a story saying

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:49.120
directly in that article, ok, that this CD can be bypassed by holding shifts. So, they're

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:56.120
suing him for his term paper that got, you know, viewed by a couple hundred people, maybe,

01:02:56.740 --> 01:03:01.520
whereas Yahoo! News gets viewed by millions and millions and millions of people. Isn't

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:08.520
that a bit ironic? Yeah, that's it. I'm done. I have a nephew of the week. I was at Golf

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:16.560
Land yesterday, and there was this really cool girl there, and I have no idea who she

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:20.840
is, but she wore a shirt that said this shirt was tested on animals. Something like that.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:25.480
I thought she was cool. She's really good at DDR. She passed dropout, which is pretty

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:34.480
good. So, she was playing and these asshole drunk people got up next to her and started

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.480
playing without putting the money in. They were dancing on the pad, mocking her and stuff

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:42.760
like that. I fucking hate those people. So, F you to those people. But it was really great

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:47.620
because I couldn't find him I was in the middle of my game and by the time I was

01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:53.580
done they were kind of they well this is what happened is that um they got up as

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:57.700
soon as I got off extreme they went up on extreme to start playing and she

01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:00.100
finished her game right if they put the money in the machines just kind of

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:03.540
watched them for a minute and then as soon as they went to select a song the

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:07.500
drunk guy was like oh he's trying to pick a song right and she just walked up

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:10.700
hit the down arrow several times and then walked out the door

01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:12.700
It increased the difficulty.

01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:13.700
Cool.

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:16.700
So, they failed, by the way, if you're listening.

01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:18.700
I just wouldn't have them thrown out.

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:23.700
I know, I... Keith wasn't there, and I don't like any of the other employees, really.

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.700
I don't know any of them.

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:30.700
You know what? I wonder if my track record would stay perfect, because I don't want that show playing.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:31.700
What, getting people thrown out?

01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:32.700
I guess I wouldn't have been out every time.

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:35.700
Not if you go Tuesday or Thursday, there's hardly ever people there on Tuesday or Thursday,

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.700
but like Saturday, yeah, you could.

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.700
You could have gotten those people thrown out.

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:49.480
to be my hobby. That's pretty much it. I don't really have F.U. to anything else. F.U. to

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:54.280
the fact that they decided to split Kill Bill into two parts because I'm impatient and I

01:04:54.280 --> 01:05:02.400
wanted to see both parts on Friday. You suck, Miramax. Alright, let's hear from the others

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:11.220
assembled here in the room we'll start with Andrew I'm not chub just do your

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:18.060
f-use all right f you to my Linux teacher deciding take a sick day two

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:22.060
days before the final first study day god damn it why do you gotta take a sick

01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:26.060
Okay, someone needs to fix him. Make him all better.

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:40.060
F.E. was talking about something and just not being able to get your point across. I find it happens to me way too often.

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:46.060
Especially when I'm on this show. So, that's about it. Not too anxious for today.

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:51.060
Then, let's hear from Bradley.

01:05:51.060 --> 01:06:02.060
Okay, uh, fuck you to not finding work so far.

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:06.060
I didn't mean to work hard on that, at least I had that job, I think.

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:07.060
Thank you for that, at least.

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:12.060
So, fuck you to me for doing it too fast, because I got it done in like 5.5 hours.

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:17.060
They probably would have paid me for the whole day and I would have slowed down a bit.

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:20.060
Took a while to finish this.

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:24.060
Being a lady.

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:27.060
Too good at Excel, I guess.

01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:32.060
It's kind of like thinking of other ways that I could have done it faster.

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:33.060
Anyway.

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:41.060
Fuck you to my falling credit rating, because I know it's doing that as we speak.

01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:45.060
And bad things are coming on the horizon. I don't move really, really fast.

01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:50.060
I'm getting stuff started paying off, and I'm finding a job, so.

01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:56.060
And fuck you to Bank of America, because they changed their bill, they changed their credit card bill,

01:06:56.060 --> 01:07:05.060
So it takes a day to pay instead of the same day, so it fucked me up last month.

01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:16.060
The guy taking too long so long to finally tell me that I didn't get the job.

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:21.060
Making me wait so long to wait to the inevitable.

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:23.060
Um...

01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:25.060
Oh...

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:27.060
I don't know.

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:31.060
But here's the general situation.

01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:35.060
I must per- persevere.

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:39.060
Okay. I think that's about everything.

01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:43.060
I think.

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:47.060
Alright, then let's hear from our chat room.

01:07:47.060 --> 01:08:03.940
My FU of the week is to school, since tomorrow is Columbus Day and we don't have it off from

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:04.940
school.

01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:09.660
Since I guess, finally, that our school has decided to be politically correct, since Columbus

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:14.060
never was the first person to discover America, but it was the indigenous Native American

01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:15.060
peoples.

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:21.420
Damn school, we should still have a day off. It's supposed to be a national holiday. Fucking

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:26.740
bastard holes. Hey, guess what? Numb nuts, I have to work tomorrow. So you can damn well

01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:34.060
go to school. And you know what? You should have to go to school during summer too because

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:45.740
I'll get summer off all right moving on zodiac night says my fuck you the week

01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:51.700
goes to best buy calm for fucking up my order postponing my shipment of max to

01:08:51.700 --> 01:09:06.420
U.S. for another week. Minsk would like to say a preemptive F.U. to the week coming up.

01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:14.580
It's going to be hell for me. F.U. to the bursars office at my college. They are charging

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:19.580
late fees to me for a balance I paid off three weeks ago.

01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:26.580
Let's do em.

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:31.580
Oh, uh, well Jamie, would you like to repeat that advice?

01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:33.580
Give Jamie a mic.

01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:35.580
Oh.

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:37.580
Well, shit.

01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:41.580
Um, so that's the FUs of the week since we didn't get that many of them this week,

01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:44.600
So I guess y'all are having a good week. Lucky you guys

01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:50.260
Loki what's going on in the sim world? Let's have a sim update

01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:55.740
What I I don't care if he's in the kitchen

01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:01.220
The show must go on god damn it

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:07.620
Let's see

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:12.620
I mean, it's 3.9 alpha 7 or something.

01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:13.620
It's out now.

01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:17.620
I can't even keep track because the name's getting too long.

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:18.620
God damn it.

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:22.620
And then some improvements have been made there, I think.

01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:27.620
And then I know that they brought back Easy to Dancer support, which, yay.

01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:30.620
And then, what else?

01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:36.620
People are ripping stuff for Max 2, USA.

01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:47.620
You know, God damn it, if I did it, I would have been done by now, but, you know, they're still doing it, and Lawrence from DDRUK is kind of heading up the project, so that's kind of cool, because he does a really good job on him.

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:55.620
What project? Why is it a project? If one guy can do it in an hour, what is needing to be a project of it?

01:10:55.620 --> 01:11:01.260
retarded these people are retarded they can't fucking just do it very simple

01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:06.260
because it always has to be complicated they always have to like get six people

01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:10.260
to do it or ten people to do it and no one knows what they're doing so that's

01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:16.340
why it's complicated okay just wondering why is it always got to be so complicated

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:24.060
why you gotta go make things so complicated anyway other than that there's gonna be

01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:33.020
also obviously now do your extreme stuff to rip so and then apparently you have

01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:46.660
to pee too much if they're typing on a keyboard. Pee on the floor that would be

01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:56.340
cool anyway now also another thing I found in my little travels on the board

01:11:56.340 --> 01:12:02.420
there they have someone made a because as you know step mania has an unlock

01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:08.860
system just in case if you were to ever to you know want to do unlocks and then

01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:13.980
so they actually made an editor so you can do an unlocks with an editor which

01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:53.980
No, that's rodsteal0014. You only live until you die.

01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:56.980
That's a title. It's a porno.

01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:59.980
Did you see that Brad and Irene loaned us the Whore of the Rings 2?

01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:06.980
I haven't gotten to watch it. That's who it was. Brad and Irene. I was just thinking, Matt doesn't have porno like that.

01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:15.740
There's really not much going on in the sim world.

01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:19.860
I've been going on like 4 months now since I played setmania yet for some reason I still

01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:20.860
download songs.

01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:22.860
Of course I have it I guess.

01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:23.860
Sucker.

01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:25.860
Bandwidth horror.

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:34.260
You say that now.

01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:39.820
It would have been a good parody of James Bond if they had just removed a lot of the

01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:40.820
porn stuff.

01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:46.980
It was funny on its own, but then they have people having sex for no reason and it just

01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:49.580
detracts from it.

01:13:49.580 --> 01:14:03.420
I also got like six copies of Suicide Circle this week, maybe, yeah that's it, nothing

01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:10.100

I know you've got nowhere to go

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.500
I can't live you

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.500
Don't sit there and wait

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.500
It's all on the line

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:25.500
Don't take my weight on you

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:59.500
La la la la la la la la la

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:27.500
Oh

D-a-a-a-a-a-a...

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:56.960
I'm awake at night and I start reaching for you every single time I wish you'd been

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.960
With a little clue that

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:11.960
There's nothing else that can make me feel the way you do

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:13.960
And the phones all don't provide the whumpin' heat

01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:15.960
When the night starts talkin' through

01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:33.960
Kissing you is more than I can stand Need you here with me, so baby

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:43.960
Let's get close again, I'm so in love You may be far away, but I need you here to stay

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:51.960
Now to hold me for I'll never get enough You're the only one for me, come on over and

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:59.960
And you'll see you and me, we are from love

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:27.160
Hello? Hello, is this thing on testing? Testing one two?

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:31.560
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:35.560
Hello? I don't understand this. This thing works?

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.160
This thing reads like stereo instructions.

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:37.960
Is this on?

01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:38.460

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:44.760

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:45.960

Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:55.540
I bet we've got a comment from the chat room during the break that we're not our usual

01:23:55.540 --> 01:24:00.980
chirpy cells or perky cells tonight we're kind of in a mess sort of move feel perky

01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:11.300
I think we just all need to get laid but I did well hi welcome back there's such things

01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:25.540
So if you got laid, Jamie, what's your excuse?

01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:26.540
I'm all tired out.

01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:27.540
Oh, you're spent.

01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:28.540
I see how it is.

01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:29.540
Oh, you're spent.

01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:30.540
Oh, me.

01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:31.540

Anyway.

01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:37.540
So we're all just spent then.

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:38.540

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:39.540
I see.

01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:43.460
Well I don't know what to tell you, yeah we are all in a weird mood.

01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:45.460
I think it is just the weather or something.

01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:46.460
I don't know what it is.

01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:47.460
Maybe we are just.

01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:50.660
I am plenty happy and perky.

01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:53.660
You rest of you are being.

01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:55.340
Are you saying we are bringing this show down?

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:58.780
You are bringing me down man.

01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:01.860
You need to kiss my ass woman.

01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:03.060
Not my job, hello.

01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:04.660
It is nobody's job.

01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:05.660
It is alright.

01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:06.660
Sorry.

01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:10.780
Look at you puppy.

01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:11.780
I don't want.

01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:12.780
Eww.

01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:13.780
Eww.

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:14.780
Eww.

01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:21.180
You are disgusting Andrew, I'm glad nobody can hear that.

01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:29.500
Umm, Loke you want to talk about some actual news going on right now?

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:35.740
I wish sometimes we were a TV show so you could have seen that throw.

01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:39.220
I know what it is.

01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:43.780
Kitty Jo says you guys are cranky and that makes me think yeah I think we are all on

01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:44.780
our collective period.

01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:46.980
We are all on the same cycle.

01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:54.100
So right now, never mind.

01:25:54.100 --> 01:26:01.100
Last time I checked, Kitty Joe wasn't a psychiatrist, so, uh, shut the hell up!

01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:08.100
Anyways, um, actual news, obviously, first thing would be, um, DDR Extreme, you know,

01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:09.100
coming out.

01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:10.100
Oh, yeah, that.

01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:12.100
Oh, yeah, oops, forgot about that.

01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:15.700
You know, that we've been playing the VRare songs from and the consumer track songs from

01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:16.700
all night.

01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:17.700
Yeah.

01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:20.540
Cause, you know, we were kind enough to steal them from BomaniStyle because we haven't gotten

01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:22.540
ours yet.

01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:31.700
Yeah I don't have PMS I do that all the time

01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:38.580
Loki news news oh yeah it came out um it wasn't a surprise because we knew it was going to

01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:43.900
come out for a while now you know what's funny about this is that yesterday the 11th of October

01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:48.020
was actually national coming out day so it's kind of funny to keep hearing you say we knew

01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:51.740
it was going to come out it's going to come out for a while now I'm just laughing because

01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:56.420
I am thinking of International Coming Out Day and DDR Extreme and how DDR is really

01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:57.420
gay.

01:26:57.420 --> 01:27:06.700
But anyways, there are some songs on there, most notably the songs that we knew were there

01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:12.820
and people were saying no you are wrong, like Max Period, everyone is saying that is a dumb

01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:17.780
name for a song, how could that be coming out, well guess what it was in there and so

01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:28.020
high laugh at you and then um what else oh there was um a new um well obviously we found out that

01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:32.260
the song that everyone liked that we thought was called overloaded was actually a stupid barber

01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:40.180
which is a stupid name it was a very stupid name for that song and then um also obviously under 12

01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:45.940
was in there which is another one that was rumored to be in there and um scorched moon which i'm sure

01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:49.980
we'll hear later was another one that was in there which is pretty cool and

01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:54.700
see now what was interesting about the whole DDR extreme thing was is first off

01:27:54.700 --> 01:28:02.480
you had a new remix by 2mb which was max period and second and second of all max

01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:07.780
period max period which was

01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:18.720
So also you have Max 3 which people are kind of hearing that song going is this the end

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:25.320
of DDR what does this mean because obviously when we play it later on and for those who

01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:30.980
have already heard it it's got the part thank you for playing and all that stuff it's a

01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:36.460
really weird song it kind of gives you the impression it's over and done with like there's

01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:42.340
nothing more other than like this compilation crap that's coming out now

01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:49.180
another thing also which is interesting kind of unrelated to the whole thing is

01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:55.600
that I was looking I was looking actually in the max2 disk and you know

01:28:55.600 --> 01:29:02.120
how you can pull up because every single remix or every single game that comes

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:06.680
out has a full list of all the songs pretty much a master list of all the

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:11.760
songs that are actually going to be in the consumer mixes and the arcade mixes

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:19.040
and whatnot so you'll have this giant master list and Max 2 USA it's pretty

01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:28.360
much a compilation up to DDR extreme and also with I believe the ultra mix which

01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:33.800
which is kind of neat. But one of the things that I found in there which was quite interesting

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:39.640
was there was yet another Max remix that's going to be coming out pretty soon. Which

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:47.060
I have to find my list. Oh here we go. Okay. Here's one of the songs that was in there

01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:55.340
that was kind of interesting. It was Maximumizer. Which is kind of a weird name. Maximumizer

01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:57.340
I guess maximum a miser

01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:02.620
So I guess maybe that might be the new max for an ultra mix maybe maybe

01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:08.820
Because I don't think that anyone in the right mind actually name a song maximum a miser other than katami

01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:11.660
so

01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:13.820
That was interesting

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:18.640
But yeah, that's pretty much all all the new wanna read these songs. We have any list there

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:18.940
Yeah

01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:23.260
These are songs that are gonna be coming out or we're gonna come out like for instance

01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:29.340
there's some of them that recognize one of them stronger by britney spears that was rumored supposed

01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:34.860
to be in um euro mix 2 right no i don't know if it's in euro mix 2 but it might have been

01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:41.900
the things that you do hula radio mix um i think that was also in euro mix 2 tamo was your mix 2

01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:49.420
funk boogie i have no idea what that is addicted the bass i believe was ultra mix um disco 2000

01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:52.460
I have no idea which one that would be.

01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:59.260
It Takes More, I Don't Know, I Would Die For You, and For You being number four in You,

01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:00.260
I don't know what that is.

01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:03.780
I keep thinking of the Garbage Song, but that's the number one crush.

01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:08.180
Shake Your Body, which I don't know what it is, I don't recognize any of these songs.

01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:12.340
One Step Closer is going to be in the new Dancing Stage Fever, I know that.

01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:15.820
Freak Like Me might also be in there.

01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:23.020
When you look at me it's the Christina Milan song from, it's the song that we have in rotation

01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:26.060
on the station actually, I recognize the song.

01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:28.280
I think it's from Euromix too I want to say.

01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:30.660
I think so.

01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:41.660
Then there's Virtuality, which is another one, hold on, I don't think that's in DDR, I swear

01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:46.660
Dizzy, which I don't know what that is.

01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:49.660
Darn, from back here it looked like Dirty and I got excited.

01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:52.660
2020 Vision, which is, I don't know.

01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:58.660
And Maximumizer, which is interesting, and Saturday Night Live, or Saturday Night Love, actually.

01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:02.660
And those are the new songs to expect to see on some...

01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:05.660
Clarification, what was the Funk B one?

01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:07.660
Um...

01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:08.660
What was it?

01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:09.660
Funk Boogie.

01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:10.660
Funk Boogie.

01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:14.540
So I have no idea what those are, but I guess they're going to be coming out later on in

01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:15.540
some release.

01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:17.540
So look for them.

01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:21.260
It'd be interesting to look at the DDR Extreme list because you're going to have even more

01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:23.580
of an update list on that too.

01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:25.620
You can't wait to hack that disk.

01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:27.980
Yes I can.

01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:28.980
I can wait.

01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:33.780
You're going to have to wait until Tuesday at least.

01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:37.900
And that's hoping UPS doesn't say screw you guys and decide to wait until Wednesday or

01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:38.900
whatever.

01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:39.900
No, they delivered the rock line.

01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:46.020
You know, UPS has fucked me over before, but yeah, that's all that's new.

01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:50.620
That and Party Collection coming out, but we already know about that, DDR Party Collection

01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:52.620
coming out at the end of the year, right?

01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:55.420
I don't know if I want to fork out the money for that.

01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:58.500
It's going to have to have the butterfly video, I figure, in order for me to pay for it.

01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:01.700
I'll get it, because that's December, so that's a ways away.

01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:02.700
Yeah, we'll see.

01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:03.700
We'll see.

01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:07.340
The next one we're going to be waiting for, though, other than UltraMix.

01:33:07.340 --> 01:33:12.180
I know I can't wait for DDR xbox is anybody in our little circle going to be getting it Jamie

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:17.820
Jamie you're gonna probably have an xbox by then because obviously we know that they're probably going to drop the price

01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:18.400
Yeah

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:25.820
If they if because this you guys know a gamecube gamecube dropped to $99 PlayStation 2 is rumored to be having meetings talking about doing

01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:26.860
the same thing

01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:32.760
By next week and supposedly they sent promotional new material to target already that says $99 PlayStation 2 is

01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:35.760
So if that happens, Xbox is going to have to.

01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:38.760
They're not going to have a choice. They're going to have to drop 99 as well.

01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:41.760
And then also those N-Gages, they suck.

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:51.760
Oh my God. I was so excited when Dan got me Plio Plio for our N-Gage.

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:56.760
And you know what? It sucks. And this is me saying that Plio Plio sucks.

01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:00.760
So we're sitting here with our, at least we didn't pay for our N-Gage.

01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:04.760
I've heard nothing but awful things about the N-Gage.

01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:08.760
Oh, poor Nelly just got beat with the mic.

01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:12.760
I was going to say...

01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:16.760
Hey, that's a good

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:20.760
quote right there. Orange Lounge Radio, when you

01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:24.760
taste the suck, you won't feel the pain.

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:28.760
Yeah.

01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:40.760
I am going to put a link in there for everyone to see. This is me making fake ads. I will do one for Orange Challenge and a bottle of Corona.

01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:41.760
Okay.

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:49.760
Yeah, the next one I think we have to really wait for is pretty much Karaoke Revolution.

01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:56.760
Karaoke Revolution is going to be a big deal. I think UltraMix is going to be interesting. The interesting thing about UltraMix is because of these song packs,

01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:01.760
We will be talking about Ultramix 3 months from now, like, you know, they released another song pack.

01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:08.760
I'm actually kind of looking, you know, it's weird, I actually really want an Xbox all of a sudden because I want Xbox Live.

01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:09.760
I just want a hacked Xbox.

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:11.760
Xbox Live is the best thing ever.

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:12.760
I want a hacked Xbox so I can...

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:14.760
And I hate it, I hate it.

01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:17.760
This is like me admitting I like a Polteri song and admitting I like bag on the air.

01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:22.760
We need I J hacked Xbox.

01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:25.760
I don't even know what the difference is, I was just going to go to GameStop and get a refurbished one.

01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:35.760
Here's a different one. We take an Xbox, we have someone hack it for us, you put in a 120GB hard drive in there, and then you download games for free, baby. Oh yeah.

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:41.760
That's the worst Austin Empowers impersonator I've ever seen in my life.

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:42.760
That wasn't a pressure.

01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:43.760
But you went like, yeah, baby.

01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:45.760
It was funny. You had to see it.

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:53.020
to see it throwing this mic around badly no the thing that's gonna be real

01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:58.060
interesting about DDR Xbox is the sucky pads since we can't plug in like

01:35:58.060 --> 01:36:03.280
ignition I don't think they make a PlayStation 2 Xbox converter they do

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:09.060
good I might get an Xbox for that then again I haven't gotten a system more

01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:16.060
recent than Virtual Voice.

01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:48.740
So, um, yeah, I don't want to like the Xbox, but I'm going to have to, and I really want

01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:55.980
to play PSO on the Xbox because somebody left their GameCube PSO for their Xbox PSO.

01:36:55.980 --> 01:36:59.700
It's because we already had the Xbox Live account.

01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:05.020
For some reason, they closed my GameCube account, so I just decided that I would play on the

01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:08.020
Xbox.

01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:20.020
Marin says she's going to be, if you see a Sky OLR on DDRXBox, that's Marin.

01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:26.820
The DDRXBox screens look very nice, I'm actually kind of, I'm excited about it, it's weird,

01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:27.820
there are arrows.

01:37:27.820 --> 01:37:32.580
I have a picture for it actually, it's in the GameStop promo book and it's got like

01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:35.940
all sorts of characters on there, I'll bring it next week.

01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:39.940
Dude, the cover of DDR Ultramix is like a big DDR character orgy.

01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:44.940
Who cares? It's arrows and music. Let it stick to arrows and music.

01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:47.940
But it's pretty. It's pretty arrows and pretty music.

01:37:55.940 --> 01:37:58.940
Alright. I think we'll take a quick break.

01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:02.940
And then when we come back we'll do the cage match.

01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:16.940
In this break I think we will finally play the max period because you guys have been dying to hear it.

01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:22.940
So we'll hear that. We're going to hear a stupid barber.

01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:29.940
And then we'll play Think You Better D the original mix because I fucked up last time and I actually played I Need You instead.

01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:32.060
So when we come back, we'll do the cage match and talk about

01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:34.420
more stuff, more news, more fun, here on

01:38:34.420 --> 01:38:40.180
talk about more stuff, more news, more fun here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:08.420
Thank you for playing.

01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:44.940

Work that body, work that body

Make sure you don't hurt nobody

01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:31.760

Hey, hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs

01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:58.000
absolutely nothing to go to, and still the fun is just as great.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.520
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:05.220
Take it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

01:45:05.220 --> 01:45:07.140
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:08.140
Give it.

01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:11.140
Jamie is demanding the mic.

01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:12.140
Hi.

01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:13.140
Rob.

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:14.140
What?

01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:15.140
Rob.

01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:16.140
What?

01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:17.140
Rob.

01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:18.140
What?

01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:19.140
Rob.

01:45:19.140 --> 01:45:20.140
What?

01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:21.140
Rob.

01:45:21.140 --> 01:45:22.140
What?

01:45:22.140 --> 01:45:23.140
I hate you.

01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:31.180
By the way, Max Resurrection and Neo Max suck and they will never be in DDR and so stop

01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:36.980
asking stop wanting get over it when real music gets made it will be put in the DDR

01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:47.860
not this crappy fan made shit I'm sorry no one can hear that you're on mic so a little

01:45:47.860 --> 01:45:54.340
bit of the discussion from a commercial break carrying over to the show what what what what

01:45:54.340 --> 01:46:02.500
what you do that again i'm going to shove that ferret so far up your ass that you'll

01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:09.060
be pooping ferret noises

01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:15.220
matt won't uh so easy and never fails loki won't max resurrection and uh neomax be in

01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:30.160
your sim on your big arcade machine? No. You'll purposely be leaving them out? I have like

01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:35.540
27 max remakes because I really don't need them. I'm going to limit it down to like three

01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:43.760
or four. But will the Legend of Trance be in there? Um, maybe. It's pretty long so of

01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:50.320
course it's going to be in there, it's mine! Mine was better anyways. Actually I do think

01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:55.920
Legend of Trance was better than the other songs. It's just ok, Neo Max is ok, it's just

01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:00.520
like they sat there all cool because they're doing piano noises, it just sounds like MIDI.

01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:06.840
It's like Star Mine, when that was made, that was actually pretty good. I mean if you get

01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:14.800
a remix of like Max 300 or something or even the Legend of Max. That would be awesome because

01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:18.640
I mean obviously what we're going to see here in the cage match. Oh, Ken did my pick for

01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:23.880
the cage match last week and he made pretty nearly a pretty kick ass. So I'd like to see

01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:31.600
him take on Max. So try that. Okay. Also during the commercial break in the chat room I was

01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:35.120
talking about I was poking fun at one of our people in the chat room who's having some

01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:38.540
trouble typing tonight because they're missing some keys and I was suggesting

01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:42.680
some Mavis Beacon and I was just thinking about like how hot Mavis Beacon

01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:50.240
is man she's rawr. Has anyone ever seen Mavis Beacon? Just kidding I'm kidding.

01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:54.260
I have. How many versions of Mavis Beacon teaches typing have we had? They're on

01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:58.880
like version 15 I think I saw recently. You know what I never ever took any typing

01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:04.040
classes ever. Me neither and I learned how to type on my Commodore 64. I learned how

01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:11.740
I learned how to type out of a sense of competition with my roommate.

01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:15.080
My roommate at the time was a secretary and she could type really fast.

01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:19.400
Out of a whole sense of competition and wanting to keep up with people in chat rooms, I can

01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:22.860
now type at my best at 90 words a minute.

01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:26.240
That's what Iguana Girl and I used to do when we worked together so we'd have a little competition.

01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:31.440
It's just a friendly banter to see who could do more issues in an hour type thing.

01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:34.900
You were the two best workers in that whole fucking building.

01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:41.180
And even when I'm under stress I can still type at you know 70 to 80.

01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:42.640
And I type with perfect grammar.

01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:48.480
I suggest if you want to learn how to type you buy yourself a Commodore 64 because those

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:52.560
computers are the shit and they have the computer inside the keyboard.

01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:53.560
How cool is that?

01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:57.480
And you can play Donkey Kong.

01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:01.480
Alright, shall we get into tonight's cage match?

01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:03.480
Sure.

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:06.480
Hi, this is Holly.

01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:12.480
Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:20.480
Loki's pick won, and he picked a remix of Paranoia called P8107 by, who was it again?

01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:21.480
OnoKen.

01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:22.480
OnoKen.

01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:23.480
And that was the winner.

01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:26.800
in a pretty overwhelming response by the chat room.

01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:28.040
The chat room really, really liked it.

01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:29.640
So will they like it two weeks in a row?

01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:30.480
We'll see.

01:54:45.840 --> 01:55:14.240
All right, song number two, Turbo with Black Cat, the history remix.

01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:19.080
I'm being told that was the pick in tourney mix for actually I don't know because I don't keep up with tourney mix and I

01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:21.960
Don't play step mania. Well, there you go, but that's okay. I mean

01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:27.040
Who cares? It's about the song not about the step file. So Jamie, would you care to rank your own pick?

01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:33.180
You know, it wasn't it actually wasn't my first pick when I went to go check how long it was was 12 minutes

01:55:33.180 --> 01:55:38.960
And I can't edit it down that small. So this was my next pick and it was pretty good and one of these days

01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:45.960
kostjamrh My thoughts are that's the gayest Pump It Up song ever, and it gets a 6.9.

01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:15.960
an 8 because it was alright. It was catchy, but I ignored most of it. Alright, Bradley,

01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:24.560
what did you think? Not pretty good. Yeah, here's when I started. You killed my through

01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:30.920
a fight. Yeah, that's okay. Uh, yeah, that was pretty good. I'll give it an 8. Alright,

01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:38.800
an 8 from Bradley. Andrew? Uh, it was alright. I've heard better. Maybe a 6. Honesty, best

01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:46.840
policy put the ferret down all right so a six from 23rd magus okay there you go

01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:50.880
ferret but you know what our opinions don't mean shit because it's your votes

01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:55.280
that ultimately decide it so you know it's like American Idol like that all

01:56:55.280 --> 01:57:00.440
right here's my pick this is an artist actually put in the cage match like four

01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:06.120
weeks ago I think an artist that I put in the cage match like four weeks ago

01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:13.320
um but i like this song like three times more than the song that i put in originally so um

01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:18.360
it's it's an old favorite family of mine to be putting in the cage match it's danny minnow

01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:23.960
tonight and the song is all i want to do and it's not the cheryl crow song it's it's even better

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:28.840

Take a look inside my heart, tell me what you think you'll see

01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:28.800
I may not be the innocent girl that you wanted me to be

01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:35.800
Sometimes I just want a lover Sometimes I don't need a friend

01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:42.800
Sometimes I just need somebody To hold me to the edge

01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:32.800
Let's take a look inside my heart Tell me what you think you need

01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:40.800
You may not see the innocent girl That you keep inside your dreams

01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:44.300
Tonight you're just one of the lovers

01:59:44.300 --> 01:59:47.800
Tonight you don't need a friend

01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:50.800
Tonight you just need somebody

01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:53.800
To hold you to the edge

02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:30.800
Take a look inside my heart

02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:37.800
I wanna take a look inside my heart

02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:57.520
Take a look inside my heart Tell me what you think you'll see

02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:06.520
I may not be the innocent girl that you wanted me to be

02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:09.520
Nothing just wanted lover

02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:13.520
And I just don't need a friend

02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:16.520
Nothing just needs somebody else

02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:20.520
Hold on to the end

02:01:50.520 --> 02:02:09.940
Okay, that was song number three, Danny Minogue with All I Wanna Do.

02:02:09.940 --> 02:02:10.940
Jamie?

02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:11.940
Seven.

02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:12.940
Too repetitive.

02:02:12.940 --> 02:02:14.940
She's a slut.

02:02:14.940 --> 02:02:15.940
I give it a ten.

02:02:15.940 --> 02:02:16.940
It's awesome.

02:02:16.940 --> 02:02:17.940
It's the best song ever.

02:02:17.940 --> 02:02:19.740
Logie.

02:02:19.740 --> 02:02:24.740
I give it a 7 because I've heard that song way too many times because you play it all the time.

02:02:25.740 --> 02:02:26.740
It's because it's awesome.

02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:28.740
Bradley.

02:02:29.740 --> 02:02:30.740
It's okay.

02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:33.740
I'll give it a 6.5.

02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:36.740
23rd, Magus.

02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:42.740
After hearing Angel play it on her radio show all the time, it still doesn't get old.

02:02:43.740 --> 02:02:44.740
It's still pretty damn good. I give it a 9.

02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:46.740
Alright.

02:02:46.740 --> 02:02:52.460

02:03:41.420 --> 02:03:51.900
room. Okay, so we'll tally those votes in a little bit. In the meantime, more witty

02:03:51.900 --> 02:03:58.020
I thought I'd read this story for you guys and get your thought on this. This is a story

02:03:58.020 --> 02:04:09.340
coming from BoycottRIAA.com, one of our favorite websites. Here's the headline, Kazaa Plans

02:04:09.340 --> 02:04:14.580
to End Free Music. This was sent by one of our chat room loyalists.

02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:20.940
Charmin Networks, like toilet paper, Charmin Networks appears to have finally crossed the

02:04:20.940 --> 02:04:25.820
line with a bid to get into bed with the big five record labels in the RIAA.

02:04:25.820 --> 02:04:29.940
Kazaa backs plans that could spell an end to the days of free music is the headline

02:04:29.940 --> 02:04:34.860
in the October 10th edition of Australia's The Age, and Australia is, you'll recall,

02:04:34.860 --> 02:04:37.100
the place Kazaa calls home.

02:04:37.100 --> 02:04:41.000
The world's most popular song-swapping network, Kazaa, has thrown its weight behind a plan

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:45.320
to start billing song swappers for their music downloads," says the article.

02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:48.520
The proposal, which could finally end the days of the free lunch for millions of music

02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:53.540
fans, has been put to big U.S. record labels at the same time as the new legitimate version

02:04:53.540 --> 02:04:57.440
of the former file-swapping giant Napster is launched in the U.S.

02:04:57.440 --> 02:05:01.720
The idea is to phase in a billing mechanism for peer-to-peer networks such as Kazaa and

02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:06.520
Morpheus that allow users to copy music directly from each other's hard drives, she states,

02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:10.440
going on that initially, payments would be by credit card, but in the future, downloads

02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:14.820
would be automatically detected and a charge added to the monthly internet service provider

02:05:14.820 --> 02:05:21.020
bill. What do you guys think? First of all, they have no real way to track something like

02:05:21.020 --> 02:05:29.520
that. First of all, this is pretty much just like Napster was where they're like focusing

02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:33.540
just on Napster or just on Kazaa. Don't they realize that people have already left the

02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:38.060
BitTorrent or like WinMX or something like that? They're just gonna dump, you know, drop

02:06:08.060 --> 02:06:20.380
all right keep trying well what do you think 23rd maggots yeah sure sure let

02:06:20.380 --> 02:06:24.380
Kazaa go to pay I'm still gonna use Kazaa allied still gonna go on the same

02:06:24.380 --> 02:06:28.940
network so you're gonna get the same shit for free they can't track me more

02:06:28.940 --> 02:06:32.260
power to them I don't care

02:06:32.260 --> 02:06:48.040
First of all, I don't use WinMX because it's shit and it actually has, I've known people

02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:52.460
though who through WinMX have had credit cards stolen off of their computer.

02:06:52.460 --> 02:06:53.460
Oh wow.

02:06:53.460 --> 02:06:54.940
Yeah, so don't use WinMX.

02:06:54.940 --> 02:06:55.940
I deleted that.

02:06:55.940 --> 02:06:56.940
I use WinMX.

02:06:56.940 --> 02:07:01.660
But yeah, but a friend of mine who is very secure with the systems.

02:07:01.660 --> 02:07:07.380
not the only person who this has happened to. Like if you have Paypal, it broke into

02:07:07.380 --> 02:07:11.420
Paypal account that way. That's why I don't have Paypal save my credit card information.

02:07:11.420 --> 02:07:17.620
But even so, you know, get that crap off your computer. It's not good for it. I have a feeling

02:07:17.620 --> 02:07:22.160
that that's how I lost my last hard drive. I'm okay with it. It's still, I mean I'm not

02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:28.120
really using it anyway. I only use it occasionally. BitTorrent is really my main thing. I'm still

02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:32.320
because I plus plus plus my bank has auto protection against all that stuff

02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:38.360
because it doesn't log IPs good it doesn't log your your username it

02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:46.920
completely changed mine yeah it blocks 480 I mean it keeps you protected it

02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:51.040
keeps you anonymous yeah and you there can be multiple anonymous it cuz I

02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:56.980
thought whatever users logged in it does not keep a track of it once and you know

02:07:56.980 --> 02:08:01.660
on top of that if you actually have it do not link to your files nobody else

02:08:01.660 --> 02:08:04.900
can download from you so they have no way of tracking no way of knowing what's

02:08:04.900 --> 02:08:10.180
there I always thought Kazaa was stupid anyway I've never used it I hate Kazaa

02:08:10.180 --> 02:08:16.540
the new Kazaa is great is it Kazaa plus it's so it's absolutely easy and I

02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:21.100
download and on top of that they've even tweaked the program now I have had 17

02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:27.300
downloads going at one time on Kazaa++. It's beautiful.

02:08:27.300 --> 02:08:32.180
I'm still a big Bittorrent fan. I use Bittorrent for my anime.

02:08:32.180 --> 02:08:36.920
What kind of sucks about Bittorrent, if you're the RIAA, is that now people are getting full

02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:42.620
CDs, not just songs. You just made things worse, and they keep getting worse. Bittorrent

02:08:42.620 --> 02:08:46.940
is not only anonymous, but it's practically unstoppable. The only way you can really shut

02:09:16.940 --> 02:09:21.900
it is they're just fucking stirring up the hornets nest they're making things worse people are getting

02:09:21.900 --> 02:09:26.140
pissed and they're just going to say fuck you instead of downloading the one song i want now

02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:33.740
i'm going to download the whole goddamn cd uh kitty kazza light does not have spyware in it

02:09:33.740 --> 02:09:41.340
the original kazza used to they they claim now that it never did it did yeah it is bullshit it

02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:42.340
it did.

02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:43.340
It had massive spyware.

02:09:43.340 --> 02:09:49.340
That's the other thing that I attribute to the loss of my last hard drive over too.

02:09:49.340 --> 02:09:50.340
Adware is our friend.

02:09:50.340 --> 02:09:56.100
Actually, there's a better program than that, it's called Adware Search and Destroy.

02:09:56.100 --> 02:10:01.780
It hunts down any, not just that, but basic installers like for Bonzi Buddy or whatever

02:10:01.780 --> 02:10:04.340
and gets them off of your computer.

02:10:04.340 --> 02:10:08.220
Fucking gator.

02:10:08.220 --> 02:10:14.020
I had, actually, also WinMX does install Spyware on your computer, too.

02:10:14.020 --> 02:10:15.220
Yes, it does.

02:10:15.220 --> 02:10:19.700
Because after I was using WinMX, I went and checked, and I had tons of Spyware on my computer

02:10:19.700 --> 02:10:22.020
just from that program.

02:10:22.020 --> 02:10:27.180
Now, I actually checked about two months after using Kazaa++ and ran the Spyware check, and

02:10:27.180 --> 02:10:31.180
there was nothing, other than what would have come through a web page.

02:10:31.180 --> 02:10:36.540
But really, it's nothing, hardly anything, like maybe 10 files, as opposed to the 200

02:10:36.540 --> 02:10:40.220
and something before with the old Kazaa I'll tell you one reason I actually really like

02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:46.960
WinMX though is that it's the song sharing program of choice in Asia so a lot of like

02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:54.240
good Asian, Korean, Japanese, Chinese stuff on there I just Kazaa I hate it I hate Kazaa

02:10:54.240 --> 02:11:01.600
I hate it so that's just me nah nah nah nah alright want to hear tonight's cage match

02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:09.200
winner? Sure. It was a squeaker tonight boys and girls by one stinking vote. Tonight's

02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:22.720
winner of the cage match by one stinking vote was the one the only P8107. That was a close

02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:28.960
one tonight. Votes were pretty much spread all out tonight which usually doesn't happen.

02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:36.960
Oh well, Jamie and I will try again next week to dethrone P8-101, whatever it is, P8-69-69-69.

02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:37.960
Alright.

02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:41.960
I have to think three weeks in advance for when I'm out of town.

02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:42.960
I know, you're going to...

02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:44.960
I'm actually going to be gone the Sunday beforehand.

02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:46.960
You're going to have your work cut out for you.

02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:47.960
Because of family deals.

02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:49.960
Jamie's going to be gone for three weeks.

02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:50.960
What are we going to do?

02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:52.960
You're going to pre-tape pump up the volume though, right?

02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:57.960
Yeah, I might record Tuesday show and then repeat it while I'm out of town.

02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:07.960
Actually, on November 3rd, I'm actually taking Monday so I can do my show before I go to Alabama.

02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:09.960
Yeah, we'll do a show swap.

02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:12.960
So there's only going to be two weeks where it'll be old material.

02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:18.960
I'm also going to be doing a special thing that I'm doing as a favor.

02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:21.960
More on that later, but it'll be replayed while I'm out of town.

02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:23.960
Okay.

02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:24.960
And that's really about it.

02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:29.440
Speaking of our spin-off shows, Monday nights on Orange Mountain Radio is Vanilla Sky where

02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:35.960
we talk about the life outside of games as well as other gaming news, non-Bomani type

02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:38.400
news.

02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:40.480
You should listen because it's great.

02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:46.080
Tomorrow night on Vanilla Sky, by the way, we are going to have a video game trivia to

02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:50.300
bad music written by somebody else, not me.

02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:53.100
Somebody else is doing it tomorrow night so that should be interesting and I will be taking

02:12:53.100 --> 02:13:00.260
the quiz tomorrow and if the subject is what I think it is I am so fucked what

02:13:00.260 --> 02:13:10.260
Loki we should you should do one with the Sierra games remember the old Sierra

02:13:10.260 --> 02:13:14.100
RPG oh shit those were the shit I'm so there

02:13:14.100 --> 02:13:19.100
Canes Quest, Police Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, Space Quest.

02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:22.100
Oh yes.

02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:27.100
So, um, yeah, okay, um, what else was I thinking?

02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:35.100
Um, coming November again, Live Wire on Wednesdays, now, the new night.

02:13:35.100 --> 02:13:43.320
Also coming in 2004, tentatively, most likely, brand new show called Orange Lounge Star-Cade,

02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:48.820
or not Star-Cade, Super-Cade, can't use the word Star-Cade because it's already a show.

02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:49.820
Yes.

02:13:49.820 --> 02:13:59.460
Brand new video game, game show, Super-Cade, every one Saturday a month, coming in 2004.

02:13:59.460 --> 02:14:00.460
With prizes.

02:14:00.460 --> 02:14:01.700
With actual prizes.

02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:03.340
For our chat room.

02:14:03.340 --> 02:14:04.340
Yes.

02:14:04.340 --> 02:14:11.540
Your chat room and in-studio are in-studio players, one winner each, so it'll be cool.

02:14:13.380 --> 02:14:14.620
That's going to be so exciting.

02:14:14.620 --> 02:14:19.580
So pretty much imagine Starrcade with all the video game playing with a ton of trivia thrown in.

02:14:19.580 --> 02:14:20.660
That's what you got.

02:14:20.980 --> 02:14:22.380
It's a very complex show.

02:14:22.380 --> 02:14:25.340
I have very, uh, I have to do a lot of stuff.

02:14:25.340 --> 02:14:27.140
I've seen the rules for this show.

02:14:27.140 --> 02:14:29.900
It's, it's, it's insane.

02:14:29.900 --> 02:14:31.900
Yeah, it'll be fun.

02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:35.900
Alright, I win.

02:14:37.900 --> 02:14:38.900
You lose.

02:14:38.900 --> 02:14:39.900
Alright, uh...

02:14:39.900 --> 02:14:41.900
I'm trying to fucking get...

02:14:41.900 --> 02:14:44.900
Jamie, would you like to plug what's on Tuesday nights on this station?

02:14:45.900 --> 02:14:46.900
A cookie?

02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:49.900
Cookies of Doom Doom!

02:14:50.900 --> 02:14:51.900
It's my show.

02:14:52.900 --> 02:14:54.900
It's a Tiska eating show.

02:14:55.900 --> 02:14:56.900
Um...

02:14:56.900 --> 02:14:58.900
Go have Rob say something about you.

02:14:58.900 --> 02:15:06.860
Sorry, um, well Tuesday nights on Orange Launch Radio at 7 o'clock is the pump up the volume

02:15:06.860 --> 02:15:08.900
pre-show and then at 7.30 it's...

02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:11.220
It's pump up the volume!

02:15:11.220 --> 02:15:15.020
Which is where nobody requests anything cause you're all...

02:15:15.020 --> 02:15:16.020
I'm sorry.

02:15:16.020 --> 02:15:19.940
Nobody ever requests anything on my show so I'm like okay why am I doing this?

02:15:19.940 --> 02:15:23.380
So it's basically where you sit for three hours and listen to whatever I feel like playing

02:15:23.380 --> 02:15:24.380
for you.

02:15:24.380 --> 02:15:25.380
Yes.

02:15:25.380 --> 02:15:32.380
in our chat room and requesting songs and I would play them hello it's over at

02:15:32.380 --> 02:15:42.540
1030 sometimes but that's yeah it's some of the volume my son little show all

02:15:42.540 --> 02:15:47.260
right I think we're gonna do we're gonna take a quick break and then we're gonna

02:15:47.260 --> 02:15:52.180
come back and I don't know we're gonna fill 45 minutes somehow with something

02:15:52.180 --> 02:15:57.860
we'll think of something creative during this break list list or match game or

02:15:57.860 --> 02:15:59.980
something like that we haven't done a list list in a while you want to list

02:15:59.980 --> 02:16:09.040
list what what subject do we want to do I know we still we never did do the top

02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:14.420
ten names for Comcast I don't know I vote for the top three and cars you'll

02:16:14.420 --> 02:16:19.020
never see an initial an initial D game I don't like cars and I don't like initial

02:16:19.020 --> 02:16:25.180
D. So we'll think of something.

02:16:25.180 --> 02:16:29.540
If you guys want to suggest a listless topic, we'll be

02:16:29.540 --> 02:16:30.700
listening for you guys.

02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:33.800
In this break, we're going to hear Sean the Horny Master

02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:35.100
with Scorching Moon.

02:16:35.100 --> 02:16:41.580
That's another Dance Revolution EX consumer track.

02:16:41.580 --> 02:16:44.140
And then we're going to hear a trance remix of music.

02:16:44.140 --> 02:16:45.620
And I don't know where this came from.

02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:47.500
Loki, you know where this came from, the trance remix of

02:16:47.500 --> 02:16:54.500
music on your computer? Yeah, it came from Winimax. It came from Winimax, alright. It's

02:16:54.500 --> 02:17:01.500
not Transfersive, it's the Madonna song. Oh, it's the Madonna song? Yeah. Oh, I thought

02:17:01.500 --> 02:17:08.500
it was music from 4th Mix, well fuck that. Play what then, Loki? I think it's the Night

02:17:08.500 --> 02:17:16.500
In Motion remix. The Night In Motion remix? Mmm, I don't think so. Here, I'll pick something.

02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:26.500
beatmania does outfades sink into trance remix

02:17:46.500 --> 02:17:52.500
of Enigma because their newest album sucked so yeah all right we'll be back

02:17:52.500 --> 02:17:59.500
after this little break we'll do Shawna Hornymaster and Boom Boom. We'll be back.

02:18:22.500 --> 02:18:24.500
I did it

02:18:24.500 --> 02:18:26.500
I did it

02:18:26.500 --> 02:18:28.500
I did it

02:18:58.500 --> 02:19:05.500
I see that

02:19:05.500 --> 02:19:12.500
I see that

02:19:12.500 --> 02:19:19.500
I see that

02:19:19.500 --> 02:19:25.500
I see that

02:19:25.500 --> 02:19:27.500
I need it

02:19:27.500 --> 02:19:29.500
I'll be there

02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:32.500
My heart goes on and on and on

02:20:32.500 --> 02:20:36.500
Every time I think of you

02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:40.500
I need some control

02:20:40.500 --> 02:20:44.500
No control of what I do

02:20:44.500 --> 02:20:48.500
Integrity, complexity

02:20:48.500 --> 02:20:52.500
The world of tragedy

02:21:52.500 --> 02:22:22.260
All right, we decided to say screw listless and we're going

02:22:22.260 --> 02:22:25.940
to do the match game instead, so in order to do match game I need some contestants.

02:22:25.940 --> 02:22:28.260
So here's tonight's qualifying question.

02:22:28.260 --> 02:22:32.460
The first two people in our chat room to send me a private message with the answer to this

02:22:32.460 --> 02:22:35.660
question will be playing in tonight's Orange Launch Radio match game.

02:22:35.660 --> 02:22:40.660
So I'm going to ask you a question from Monday's episode of Vanilla Sky, a video game trivia

02:22:40.660 --> 02:22:41.660
to bad music.

02:22:41.660 --> 02:22:42.660
So here it is.

02:22:42.660 --> 02:22:43.660
This is the question.

02:22:43.660 --> 02:22:46.980
First two people to send me the correct answer will play match game tonight.

02:22:46.980 --> 02:22:52.180
What was the name of the game put out by Universal, which was similar to Dig Dug, but the object

02:22:52.180 --> 02:22:59.320
was to collect cherries or kill all the monsters, including ones marked E, X, T, R, and A with

02:22:59.320 --> 02:23:04.060
your Powerball. The category, just to help you out for last week's Vanilla Sky video

02:23:04.060 --> 02:23:10.580
game trivia on bad music, was 80s video games. So there you go. One more time. What was the

02:23:10.580 --> 02:23:15.060
name of the game put out by Universal, which was similar to Dig Dug, but the object was

02:23:15.060 --> 02:23:20.720
to collect cherries or kill all the monsters, including ones marked E, X, T, R, and A with

02:23:20.720 --> 02:23:38.120
your powerball?

02:25:50.720 --> 02:26:03.160
Well hello, we're back, Orange Lounge Radio here.

02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:07.280
And it's time, ladies and gentlemen, to play the Bahmani Match Game.

02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:09.280
How exciting is that, everybody?

02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:10.280
Yay!

02:26:10.280 --> 02:26:14.060
I've just flamed the rules because we have some new contestants tonight who we haven't

02:26:14.060 --> 02:26:15.060
had play before.

02:26:15.060 --> 02:26:19.560
I bet you want to know who those contestants are, huh?

02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:26.760
us Rob tell us. Well in tonight's Bomani match game we have Zodiac Knight is

02:26:26.760 --> 02:26:30.840
contestant number one. That's a buddy of mine from live journal so I'm excited to

02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:37.080
see that he got the correct answer which was Mr. Do. We all knew that. Last week I

02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:39.520
tell you I don't think any of them got it right.

02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:43.800
None of the people here got it right that Mr. Do was a game. But that was the game

02:26:43.800 --> 02:26:50.100
with the cherries and the ex-TRA monsters. Contestant number two tonight is AZN Buddy

02:26:50.100 --> 02:26:57.680
Paul. Cool. He got Mr. Dew and he was second and just in case we have a standby as well

02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:03.400
if one of them should drop. Alright, the way Bamani Match Game works is that I'm going

02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:08.100
to ask a question and somewhere in that question is a blank. For instance, the question could

02:27:08.100 --> 02:27:14.900
be Arkadian42 went to the store and decided to buy some blank. So all of our celebrities

02:27:14.900 --> 02:27:18.780
here in the room will write down what they think should be in the blank. Propel! So propel

02:27:18.780 --> 02:27:23.580
would be the answer that Jamie went right. Your job is to send me the answer over a private

02:27:23.580 --> 02:27:30.340
message that you think is going to match with the most celebrities. And I'm supposed to

02:27:30.340 --> 02:27:37.100
kick no styling. Why would I kick no styling Jamie? Change your name! Okay, so I hope the

02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:41.060
contestants have an understanding of the rules yes you just send in what you

02:27:41.060 --> 02:27:45.260
think we're gonna say for the blank and then for every match you get a point and

02:27:45.260 --> 02:27:50.260
for every non match you get ridiculed horrendously by all of us introducing

02:27:50.260 --> 02:27:57.380
tonight celebrities celebrity number one is dark Sakura hi and she can her

02:27:57.380 --> 02:28:03.340

02:31:28.780 --> 02:31:32.820

02:31:32.820 --> 02:31:39.380
Damn, Rob exclaimed, that's $80 I could have spent on, Zodiac Knight says, male prostitutes.

02:31:39.380 --> 02:31:40.380
Male prostitutes.

02:31:40.380 --> 02:31:47.260
AZM buddy Paul says, damn, that's $80 guys could have spent on food.

02:31:47.260 --> 02:31:50.740
Are you saying I'm fat?

02:31:50.740 --> 02:31:57.680

02:31:57.680 --> 02:32:02.360
your answer that's $80 he could have spent on chocolate

02:32:02.360 --> 02:32:07.560
martinis and f-zero chocolate martinis and f-zero good answer good answer but

02:32:07.560 --> 02:32:13.600
not a match Loki that's $80 he could have spent on man whores man whores

02:32:13.600 --> 02:32:19.280
that's a match with zodiac night one point for zodiac night so the score is

02:32:19.280 --> 02:32:29.760
now one to nothing you'd use it for 320 quarters to gamble with 320 quarters to

02:32:29.760 --> 02:32:35.320
gamble with very good answer but unfortunately not a match my answer and

02:32:35.320 --> 02:32:40.920
this would be the correct answer by the way damn that's $80 I could have spent

02:32:40.920 --> 02:32:48.080
on booze although close to a match with food I don't think the judges rule that

02:32:48.080 --> 02:32:56.240
a match sorry Jamie propel $80 I could have spent on propel excellent but not a

02:32:56.240 --> 02:32:59.960
match well I don't know does that count as food no no I don't think it does

02:32:59.960 --> 02:33:04.920

02:52:20.820 --> 02:52:33.900
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

02:52:33.900 --> 02:52:37.860
is brought to you by the letter D, the letter A, and the number 59.

02:52:37.860 --> 02:52:43.860
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

02:52:49.860 --> 02:52:52.860
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question

02:52:52.860 --> 02:52:56.860
What will we learn this week on Ask Orange Lounge?

02:52:56.860 --> 02:53:00.860
Who's the whitest in the room? I bet you wanted to know

02:53:00.860 --> 02:53:04.060
let me tell you it's andrew and by a long shot

02:53:06.540 --> 02:53:14.220
all right our first question for ask orange lounge comes from azn buddy paul

02:53:15.020 --> 02:53:24.540
who wants to know who would who would matt do if he did lose his big black cock i'm sorry what

02:53:24.540 --> 02:53:31.100
What would Matt do if he lost his big black cock?

02:53:31.100 --> 02:53:35.740
What would you do if you lost your big black cock?

02:53:35.740 --> 02:53:38.780
I guess I'd just have to use my reserve big white cock.

02:53:38.780 --> 02:53:41.500
Alright, excellent, excellent question.

02:53:41.500 --> 02:53:48.620
ACM Buddy Paul would also like to know, would any of the Orange Lounge radio staff enter

02:53:48.620 --> 02:53:49.620
Iron Chef?

02:53:49.620 --> 02:53:50.620
I would.

02:53:50.620 --> 02:53:53.820
Oh yeah, me, I'd be first in line. That would be fucking great.

02:53:55.260 --> 02:53:57.980
So that is secret ingredient is microwave.

02:54:00.380 --> 02:54:03.740
You know, it tastes really good if you add a nice butter to it, you know.

02:54:04.420 --> 02:54:10.940
Anyways, I would yeah, I'd enter I'd be Iron Chef superfood. So yeah.

02:54:12.060 --> 02:54:17.340
You know, the thing is, though, is that I could probably enter Iron Chef and fake my way through it.

02:54:17.340 --> 02:54:21.340
Just because I used to watch all these cooking shows with my grandmother, like the Galloping Gourmet.

02:54:22.340 --> 02:54:25.340
So, I can cook really good, I just don't...

02:54:26.340 --> 02:54:29.340
I'm not saying that I'm as good as those guys, but I'd enjoy that at Iron Chef, just to be funny.

02:54:29.340 --> 02:54:32.340
What would be the secret ingredient you'd secretly wish for?

02:54:35.340 --> 02:54:37.340
Yes, instant rice.

02:54:38.340 --> 02:54:42.340
My secret ingredient would be chicken.

02:54:42.340 --> 02:54:43.340
Marin says propel.

02:54:43.340 --> 02:54:44.340
Propel.

02:54:44.340 --> 02:54:46.340
Cooking with propel.

02:54:46.340 --> 02:54:55.640
I would bet that berry flavored, propelled steamed rice would be good or lemon flavored.

02:54:55.640 --> 02:55:07.640
Next question we have is from Okyun. Okyun would like to know how are you?

02:55:07.640 --> 02:55:12.400
How and you? I'm super, thanks for asking.

02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:49.980
if you marinated me just right though I'd be damn good teriyaki me would be

02:55:49.980 --> 02:55:56.800
good I I it was it was oke on oke on the terms whatever happened with fava beans

02:55:56.800 --> 02:56:05.920
and nice Chianti all right moving on I I got the red arch it puts the lotion on

02:56:35.920 --> 02:56:43.840
games. What kind of a dumb question is that? I don't want to mod my PS2 even if it means

02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:50.840
I would get the better DDR mixes. It's country lockout. Yeah it's just country lockout. Maybe

02:56:50.840 --> 02:56:55.400
the question is deeper than it sounds. Why does Sony feel the need to lock out the Playstation?

02:56:55.400 --> 02:57:00.840
The same way they do for all games and have since the beginning of video game history.

02:57:00.840 --> 02:57:07.760
should they have to do that? Why lock us out of the Japanese game? Market share. Domestic

02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:13.640
versus foreign market. It's assy. It's assy and I don't like it. And copyright. You know

02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:18.320
true that with the Nintendo all it was was finding an old copy of Garamite and you know

02:57:18.320 --> 02:57:27.200
putting it on your game genie. But still you know they've had lockouts since the I think

02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:33.960
the Master System had lockouts because of the pin cards. The PC Engine, you can't even

02:57:33.960 --> 02:57:39.920
find a good converter to play Japanese U-Cards on a TurboGrafx. Now, however, the games did

02:57:39.920 --> 02:57:44.760
not have country lockout. The CDs did not, but it was new technology. Well, it doesn't

02:57:44.760 --> 02:57:48.120
really matter anymore anyway because we do have all these fancy ways of getting around

02:57:48.120 --> 02:57:53.400
the country lockout. You know how I got around it? How? I bought a JPS2. I held the shift

02:57:53.400 --> 02:57:57.720
key while putting in the disc now they have this thing if I think if they sell

02:57:57.720 --> 02:58:03.400
it on ncsx where you pull the lid it's like a new case that you put on your ps2

02:58:03.400 --> 02:58:07.920
and you can lift the lid off and it'll you have a card that will stop the game

02:58:07.920 --> 02:58:10.920
from spinning and you change out the disc it's really stupid it's like the

02:58:10.920 --> 02:58:17.080
old remember the on the old PlayStation they're like multi flop yes oh god I've

02:58:17.080 --> 02:58:21.840
seen someone do this the seven-point swap you know what that's right that's

02:58:21.840 --> 02:58:26.160
That's why we had, we bought the last Dualshock system that still had the IO port so we could

02:58:26.160 --> 02:58:29.160
use our GameShark.

02:58:29.160 --> 02:58:44.320
And we still had the old

02:58:44.320 --> 02:59:08.800
to know?

02:59:08.800 --> 02:59:13.200
In your opinions, at what point, what number mix?

02:59:13.200 --> 02:59:19.200
it be a good time to stop the DDR series and infinity is not an answer that was

02:59:19.200 --> 02:59:24.440
with max thank you so you think DDR was pretty much dead at six I keep playing

02:59:24.440 --> 02:59:29.560
it why not but you know it's just the same old thing there's not really much

02:59:29.560 --> 02:59:33.000
innovative that they can do with it all right

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:37.160
anybody else get answer facility in a second mix was the best I have an answer

02:59:37.160 --> 02:59:46.280
but I'll wait Magus take it to 9 make a final be done with it make it like beat

02:59:46.280 --> 02:59:50.660
mania just take it 9 in the final that's it

02:59:50.660 --> 02:59:57.500
low key care to comment so just keep making more and be glad it's still

02:59:57.500 --> 03:00:01.640
around cuz then they're not gonna make stupid ripoff like Brittany's dance beat

03:00:01.640 --> 03:00:10.080
the arcade game or some shit like that Barney's dance magic I love you you love

03:00:10.080 --> 03:00:18.480
me I'm a drunk inside a suit here's my thought on it DDR should stop at 8th mix

03:00:18.480 --> 03:00:22.840
extreme should be the last one remember how the little thing doesn't make any

03:00:22.840 --> 03:00:28.280
sense you are starting over if they don't this is my thing though DDR as we

03:00:28.280 --> 03:00:35.440
know it should be done I want DDR DX now I want DDR 2 I want DDR something new

03:00:35.440 --> 03:00:43.520
DDR as we know it is done so forget it but I think dancing games by Konami are

03:00:43.520 --> 03:00:46.640
not done yet and I think we'll see something new and it's going to be

03:00:46.640 --> 03:00:50.140
something like competitive I always say this I say this like at least every

03:00:50.140 --> 03:00:54.720
month on the show the next DDR should be something competitive DDR has always

03:00:54.720 --> 03:00:58.260
been very cooperative game with some competitive modes but they haven't been

03:00:58.260 --> 03:01:02.700
very and there haven't been much to them second mix that battle was maybe like

03:01:02.700 --> 03:01:07.320
the most competitive thing DDR ever had and then he had unison mode and then

03:01:07.320 --> 03:01:10.540
battle mode was like nothing that was just another way of doing versus mode

03:01:10.540 --> 03:01:14.260
but having like a dance magic competitive mode or something more

03:01:14.260 --> 03:01:19.440
competitive I think is where DDR should go next but who knows what Konami has an

03:01:19.440 --> 03:01:24.800
an idea of. Maybe they'll surprise me. But please God, please, no sequels to Dance Dance

03:01:24.800 --> 03:01:31.200
Dance. Thank you. Justin B. would like to know, will you play my crappy remix so that

03:01:31.200 --> 03:01:35.840
people can laugh at it? He has a new remix he wants us to play. We're running out of

03:01:35.840 --> 03:01:42.240
time on the show but we'll do it in the after birth and we'll all laugh at it. So stay tuned.

03:01:42.240 --> 03:01:46.080
Azie and Buddy Paul, this is the last question of the night, thank you all for participating in

03:01:46.080 --> 03:01:47.080
Ask Orange Lounge.

03:01:47.080 --> 03:01:51.240
Azie and Buddy Paul would like to know, what do you think about Sky starring in Kill Bill

03:01:51.240 --> 03:01:54.120
Volume 2?

03:01:54.120 --> 03:01:57.680
I think that he would probably be the first one killed by another man.

03:01:57.680 --> 03:02:01.360
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I don't like that attitude.

03:02:01.360 --> 03:02:05.760
You know what though, Kill Bill Volume 2 is already done and shot so I can't really be

03:02:05.760 --> 03:02:09.400
in it unfortunately.

03:02:09.400 --> 03:02:14.580
I would love to be just some guy that has a cameo that decides to purchase the pussy

03:02:14.580 --> 03:02:20.860
Wagon when all is said and done. The new owner of the Pussy Wagon. Yes, Loki, you want to

03:02:20.860 --> 03:02:26.420
answer the question? I would have just shot her dead. She has a sword. Oh, you're gonna

03:02:26.420 --> 03:02:33.420
go ninjutsu on me, huh? Indiana Jones all over again, bitch. I don't want to spoil anything.

03:02:33.420 --> 03:02:36.880
I don't want to spoil anything, but I could say something. I don't want to spoil anything.

03:02:36.880 --> 03:02:37.880
I already know.

03:02:37.880 --> 03:02:38.880
I already know.

03:02:38.880 --> 03:02:39.880
So ha.

03:02:39.880 --> 03:02:40.880
Alright.

03:02:40.880 --> 03:02:41.880
Yeah.

03:02:41.880 --> 03:02:42.880
Yeah.

03:02:42.880 --> 03:02:43.880
Okay.

03:02:43.880 --> 03:02:46.160
So thank you very much for asking Orange Lounge tonight.

03:02:46.160 --> 03:02:53.640
We hope you all learn something as we do every week on Ask Orange Lounge.

03:02:53.640 --> 03:02:54.640
I don't feel like singing.

03:02:54.640 --> 03:03:15.920
Well kids, it's about time for us to wrap up this train wreck of show that we call Orange

03:03:15.920 --> 03:03:16.920
Lounge Radio.

03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:19.440
So we're going to get everybody's final thoughts.

03:03:19.440 --> 03:03:22.960
We'll start with Bradley.

03:03:22.960 --> 03:03:28.960
I hope I make it. I certainly hope I do.

03:03:28.960 --> 03:03:31.960
We hope you make it too.

03:03:31.960 --> 03:03:34.960
23rd Magus.

03:03:34.960 --> 03:03:36.960
Boobies.

03:03:36.960 --> 03:03:42.960
Boobies is your final thought. Thank you, that's so mature.

03:03:42.960 --> 03:03:48.960
You're such a teenage boy. You are such a teenage boy.

03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:50.960
Well, yeah.

03:03:50.960 --> 03:03:52.640
Yeah I know.

03:03:52.640 --> 03:03:54.640
Logie your final thought?

03:03:54.640 --> 03:04:01.840
Toga, toga, toga, toga.

03:04:01.840 --> 03:04:03.160
Jamie your final thought?

03:04:03.160 --> 03:04:09.640
My final thought is, do you call that begging?

03:04:09.640 --> 03:04:17.160
My final thought is, bingo!

03:04:17.160 --> 03:04:22.640
And uh, oh did I take your word, I'm sorry.

03:04:22.640 --> 03:04:23.640
My bad, sorry.

03:04:23.640 --> 03:04:24.640
Another one.

03:04:24.640 --> 03:04:29.760
Well, hold on, we'll get, oh you have another final thought, oh okay, we'll get to the word

03:04:29.760 --> 03:04:30.760
in a minute.

03:04:30.760 --> 03:04:33.320
We'll get to the word in a minute, but I just wanted to thank everybody for listening to

03:04:33.320 --> 03:04:37.400
and supporting Orange Lawns Radio, without you we're nothing, we're shit, we suck, we're

03:04:37.400 --> 03:04:44.120
were scum. No, we're still great either way. But no, we do thank you for your support and

03:04:44.120 --> 03:04:50.960
thanks for tuning in as you do every Sunday night and take care of yourself and each other.

03:04:50.960 --> 03:04:58.960
Tonight's final word goes to Jamie. You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:04:58.960 --> 03:05:05.720
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki. We expect you a nice play again.

03:05:05.720 --> 03:05:08.720
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:05:08.720 --> 03:05:14.720
As your leader, I encourage you from time to time and always in a respectful manner

03:05:14.720 --> 03:05:16.720
to question my options.

03:05:16.720 --> 03:05:21.720
If you're unconvinced a particular plan of action I've decided is the wise, tell me so.

03:05:21.720 --> 03:05:29.720
But allow me to convince you, and I promise you right here and now, no subject will ever be taboo.

03:05:29.720 --> 03:05:32.620
Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion.

03:05:35.620 --> 03:05:41.520
The price you pay for bringing up either my Chinese or American heritage as a negative is...

03:05:42.020 --> 03:05:43.720
I collect your fucking head.

03:05:44.720 --> 03:05:46.520
Just like this fucker here.

03:05:49.220 --> 03:05:56.120
Now, if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

03:05:56.120 --> 03:06:01.120
I didn't think so.

03:06:01.120 --> 03:06:08.120
Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:06:31.120 --> 03:06:43.800
Alright, welcome back boys and girls to Orange Lawn's radio to Afterbirth. So as promised,

03:06:43.800 --> 03:06:49.600
this is when you covered in Ask Orange Lawn. Rob, can I collect your fucking head? No,

03:06:49.600 --> 03:06:55.320
you may not collect my fucking head. We kind of have to make this a quick Afterbirth because

03:06:55.320 --> 03:06:58.880
we're running into the movie theater to go see Kill Bill for the second time from Magus's

03:06:58.880 --> 03:07:03.900
case the first time. He's a Kill Bill virgin. I encourage you to see Kill Bill as many times

03:07:03.900 --> 03:07:07.760
as you can at the theater. I think this should be the new cult movie. This should be like

03:07:07.760 --> 03:07:11.840
the Rocky Horror Picture Show Part 2 or something. Wouldn't this be fun to shadow cast? Oh my

03:07:11.840 --> 03:07:19.320
god, I'd so be like a member of the 88 gang. I would of course have to take GoGo's character.

03:07:19.320 --> 03:07:27.300
Alright. Here we go. This is from our very own Justin Beah. We play things that our chat

03:07:27.300 --> 03:07:31.760
room builds because we support our chat room just like they support us we're gonna play

03:07:31.760 --> 03:07:38.320
something it's a remix he did it's the speedy mix because you know justin b this is uh jamma

03:07:38.320 --> 03:07:41.960
and the song is called gotta dance and he apparently remixed this quite a bit apparently

03:07:41.960 --> 03:07:47.000
the vocals are the only thing from the original song the rest of it he did so enjoy let us

03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:54.000
know what you think. This is Jammo with Gotta Dance, the Speedy Mix by Justin Bieber.

03:09:47.000 --> 03:10:06.560
well we need to laugh at it now ha ha ha ha remix ha ha ha speedy mix ha ha and if

03:10:06.560 --> 03:10:10.480
sauce hasn't seen um kill bill by the time we go to alabama i'll pay it for her to see it

03:10:10.480 --> 03:10:15.960
Of course I can upload it to her.

03:10:15.960 --> 03:10:22.160
Now we don't endorse piracy here on Orange Lounge Radio, we endorse it.

03:10:22.160 --> 03:10:27.920
Hi, I don't really have anything interesting to say in the after work tonight.

03:10:27.920 --> 03:10:29.880
No, I have a headache.

03:10:29.880 --> 03:10:32.080
Yeah, we're just all in a mad kind of mood.

03:10:32.080 --> 03:10:35.880
We're all in a pissy mood, remember?

03:10:35.880 --> 03:10:39.120
What I feel Orange Lounge Vocal edit, I don't remember, was that the one where I was going

03:11:09.120 --> 03:11:35.120
Oh, was it BRP Ohio, I'm sorry. Oh, my bad. Interesting. Interesting. Oh, sorry for mixing that up. I just can't remember. So many cool people on our show. Okay. If nobody else has anything to say, then I guess that's the afterword.

03:11:35.120 --> 03:11:44.760
We are going to do in the post show here, what should we play for them post show tonight?

03:11:44.760 --> 03:11:45.760
Eurobeat.

03:11:45.760 --> 03:11:46.760
Eurobeat?

03:11:46.760 --> 03:11:47.760
Yeah.

03:11:47.760 --> 03:11:52.000
I don't know if I have any Eurobeat albums really.

03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:55.960
Don't you have my CD with the 614 megabytes of Eurobeat?

03:11:55.960 --> 03:11:56.960
I do.

03:11:56.960 --> 03:11:57.960
I do somewhere.

03:11:57.960 --> 03:11:58.960
Hold on I'll find it.

03:11:58.960 --> 03:11:59.960
You have to fill time while I find it though.

03:11:59.960 --> 03:12:03.960
I was supposed to do a Eurobeat marathon and I didn't.

03:12:03.960 --> 03:12:05.960
I feel so bad.

03:12:05.960 --> 03:12:08.960
I played Happy Hardcore instead.

03:12:08.960 --> 03:12:11.960
I think it was volume 7 of Happy to be Hardcore.

03:12:11.960 --> 03:12:15.960
I need to go back and get the others.

03:12:15.960 --> 03:12:19.960
I don't need to get that CD when you're talking about it.

03:12:19.960 --> 03:12:22.960
Somebody alert No Styling that we're going to do a Eurobeat marathon.

03:12:22.960 --> 03:12:27.960
Yeah, make sure that he's got a change of underwear handy or something.

03:12:27.960 --> 03:12:30.960
Because he's probably going to go through about five of them.

03:12:33.960 --> 03:12:39.960
Alright, the room is already excited about this one, so hopefully the CD is not scratched too bad and it will play alright.

03:12:39.960 --> 03:12:43.960
So, um, we'll see what happens here.

03:12:45.960 --> 03:12:48.960
Alright, I think we're set here. I'm just going to cue up all the music.

03:12:52.960 --> 03:12:56.960
Thank you once again, boys and girls, for your loving and caring support of Orange Lounge Radio. We appreciate it.

03:12:56.960 --> 03:13:03.160
it and this Euro beats for you. We'll go pa-da-pa-da our way to the movie theater.

03:13:03.160 --> 03:13:11.520
Yes, we're going to pa-da-pa-da our ass off at the movie theater. Is it going? If it skips,

03:13:11.520 --> 03:13:15.520
I apologize in advance. The CD might be a little skip, but we're going to do our best.

03:13:15.520 --> 03:13:17.520
Goodnight everybody!

03:13:45.520 --> 03:14:03.520

03:14:03.520 --> 03:14:08.520

03:14:21.520 --> 03:14:23.520
Can't wait to say

Nothing will sing and I can take another time

03:15:12.520 --> 03:15:17.520

Baby you belong to me, yes you do, yes you do You're in my faction, I can't make you want to cry

03:18:36.140 --> 03:18:52.140
If I do, if I do, I will be good You're like a cruel device, your blood is cold Like ice boiling from my veins, I'm breaking my chains One look and you can't kill My pain, I'll miss your thrill, you'll love it for me

03:18:52.140 --> 03:18:55.880
I said, try me, take a chance of emotion

03:18:55.880 --> 03:18:58.560

I said drive me, take a stand from affection

03:21:48.680 --> 03:21:51.680
We speak together all the time

03:21:51.680 --> 03:21:54.680
Say try me, take a sense of emotion

03:21:54.680 --> 03:21:57.680
For now we're never into my heart

03:21:57.680 --> 03:22:01.680

03:22:01.680 --> 03:22:04.680
We speak together till the morning light

03:22:04.680 --> 03:22:07.680
Don't stand so, don't stand so

03:22:07.680 --> 03:22:10.680
Nothing so good to me

03:22:37.680 --> 03:22:48.680
4, 3, 2, 1

03:22:48.680 --> 03:23:04.680
No one sees me talking out

03:23:04.680 --> 03:23:10.680
A night when the light is no one with the radio

03:23:10.680 --> 03:23:14.680
Your heat's on fire

03:23:26.680 --> 03:23:29.680
Even if you say I have been the worldwide

03:23:29.680 --> 03:23:32.680
I'll take you where surely you have never been

03:23:32.680 --> 03:23:36.680
All right in the fight, I'm okay, come on!

03:23:38.680 --> 03:23:39.680
Come on!

03:23:41.680 --> 03:23:45.680
Hey, do you feel the light? It's miserable

03:23:45.680 --> 03:23:48.680
Because it's always just unbelievable

03:23:48.680 --> 03:23:53.680
No other place is like that in the world, world, world

03:23:54.680 --> 03:23:57.680
No one sleeps in Tokyo

03:23:57.680 --> 03:24:00.680
All night crossing the line

03:24:00.680 --> 03:24:06.680
No one quits the radio Stop your heat from fire

03:24:06.680 --> 03:24:12.680
No one sleeps in Tokyo All night crossing the lane

03:24:12.680 --> 03:24:19.680
No one quits the radio, talk your head from fire

03:24:31.680 --> 03:24:35.680
Turning to the left, you can see the red lights

03:24:35.680 --> 03:24:38.680
And to the right, crazy music everywhere

03:24:38.680 --> 03:24:42.680
All right, in the fight, I'm okay, come on!

03:24:43.680 --> 03:24:45.680
Come on!

03:24:47.680 --> 03:24:50.680
Hey, do you feel the light? It's breathable

03:24:50.680 --> 03:24:53.680
Look at the sun, which is unbelievable

03:24:53.680 --> 03:24:58.680
No other place is like that in the world, world, world

03:24:58.680 --> 03:24:59.680
One, two, three, four

03:24:59.680 --> 03:25:02.680
No one lives in Tokyo

03:25:02.680 --> 03:25:05.680
All night crossing the line

03:25:05.680 --> 03:25:11.680
No one's with the radio, talk your ears on fire

03:25:11.680 --> 03:25:17.680
No one's with the Tokyo, all night crossing the line

03:25:17.680 --> 03:25:25.680
No one's with the radio, don't you hear some fire

03:26:17.680 --> 03:26:19.680
All right.

03:26:47.680 --> 03:26:54.680
Unbelievable, no other place is like back in the world, world, world

03:26:54.680 --> 03:27:00.680
No one lives in Tokyo, all night crossing the line

03:27:00.680 --> 03:27:07.680
No one quits the radio, Tokyo is on fire

03:27:07.680 --> 03:27:13.680
No one lives in Tokyo, all night crossing the line

03:27:13.680 --> 03:27:20.680
No one quits the radio, don't you eat the fire

03:27:43.680 --> 03:27:47.680
Lonely love

03:28:04.680 --> 03:28:07.680
Lonely love

03:28:07.680 --> 03:28:14.680
I can feel, feel right, I need you on the line Forever, lonely love

03:28:27.680 --> 03:28:30.680
Don't let enough of time with love and passion escape

03:28:30.680 --> 03:28:33.680
Nobody knows what my dear foundation

03:28:33.680 --> 03:28:35.680

Just to see the music tonight, just tonight Lonely love, I love my bride

Come on and dance with me, hold up my phone for you

03:28:58.720 --> 03:29:04.480
Lonely love, music for my life So bright in the sky, can't I see for the night

03:29:04.480 --> 03:29:08.140
But a lonely love, maybe not only time

03:29:08.140 --> 03:29:11.140
Make me lose, it's just a life for you

03:29:11.140 --> 03:29:13.820
A lonely love, lost in your eyes

03:29:13.820 --> 03:29:15.320
Make me feel, feel alive

03:29:15.320 --> 03:29:17.420
I need you all the night forever

More and more to see

03:33:48.020 --> 03:33:51.020
Like a fox in the dark

03:33:51.020 --> 03:33:53.820
Like a fox in the dark

03:33:53.820 --> 03:33:56.620
No matter where we sleep or we fight

03:33:56.620 --> 03:34:00.420
No matter where we suffer, we rise

03:34:00.420 --> 03:34:06.420
Like a fox in the dark

03:34:06.420 --> 03:34:09.420
No matter where we sleep or we cry

03:34:09.420 --> 03:34:12.420
No matter where we love or we ride

03:34:25.420 --> 03:34:28.420
I'll take you to the beach

03:34:28.420 --> 03:34:31.920
Darkest place, baby don't be afraid

03:34:31.920 --> 03:34:36.220
I'll take you in the dark to know the place

03:34:36.220 --> 03:34:40.420
Remember what you said, come on, girl don't leave right

03:34:40.420 --> 03:34:43.420
Cause you got me through the hole

03:34:43.420 --> 03:34:47.920
But it feels so deep, I'm still in love for more

Like a fox in the dark

03:34:55.920 --> 03:34:58.480
No matter where we sleep or we fart

03:34:58.480 --> 03:35:01.820
No matter where we stop or we run

03:35:02.520 --> 03:35:05.620
Like a spark in the dark

03:35:05.620 --> 03:35:08.460
Like a spark in the dark

03:35:08.460 --> 03:35:10.040

I don't know what I'm doing Maybe it's the time to let me go

03:37:56.040 --> 03:38:02.040
