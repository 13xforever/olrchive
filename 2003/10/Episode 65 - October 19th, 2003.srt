1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,760
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Mommy Talk and then some.

3
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,040
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,040
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

5
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:36,040
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

6
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,040
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,040
Yes, I will spank your child.

8
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,040
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

9
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,040
Well, here's to my big opening.

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,040
A sphincter says why?

11
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,040
I'm super. Thanks for asking.

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,340
You little bitch troll from hell.

13
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,540
What am I doing here?

14
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,040
Haha!

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,040
Nooooooo!

16
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
Dodge this.

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,040
Mm-hmm.

18
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,040
This is a tasty burger.

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,540
Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left!

20
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,540
It's a house?

21
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,540
Look!

22
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,540
It's a flesh wound.

23
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:17,540
Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a polyshore.

24
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,040
Oh, yeah?

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,540
Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

26
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,540
Dark Sakura.

27
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:30,220
I had a sniff, sky, but I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer, Loki, I hate you,

28
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:41,220

35
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,700
and I'm sick and abusive

36
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,740
I'm past the contagious stage I'm fine

37
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:22,740
p0k3smot42o1 my name is rob roberts view you might know me as sky

38
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,780
joining me as always are half of my awesome co-hosts

39
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,980
in this empty corner

40
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,360
the sickest bunny on the farm is jamie summers you know her better is dark sakura

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,900
is out sick today

42
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,800
i had a sniff

43
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,440
now you tell me

44
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,440
Hold on.

45
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,440
I'm going to stop this for a minute.

46
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:57,400
You tell me if both me, Loki, and Jamie are all sick, what does that tell you?

47
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,200
Somebody here last Sunday was sick.

48
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
That's what I'm trying to get at.

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,480
I don't know, but I have a feeling you guys are all having sex.

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,480
That's why you're all getting sick.

51
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:12,120
Well, it could be that there's a cold going around anyways, and more than one time people

52
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,420
have it because there are people in my work that had it before me. So, it's obviously

53
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,780
not just one person. It can be totally unrelated.

54
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,180
Especially when you work at a large place like you do.

55
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,560
Or it could be, you know, what the most obvious answer is. It's a government conspiracy to

56
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:35,080
shut us down. They have had bioterrorists come in and, you know, poison our food supply.

57
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:42,080
Thank God I ate it all and um, yeah, we don't have a lot of time left.

58
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:49,080
Alright, um, oh hey, knock on the door, yay, another well person.

59
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:55,680
Hey, now we can get him sick, yeah, we can get him sick too, alright, let me uh, let

60
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,200
me finish the intro here.

61
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,920
See, she got sick from work, so, nyeh.

62
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Well, you should have stopped it!

63
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,880
Oh shit.

64
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,240
Alright, well...

65
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,160
Alright, alright, alright.

66
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,600
Just forget the intro.

67
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Forget it.

68
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,960
Forget it.

69
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,440
Alright, so Jamie's not here, but she is in the chat room, so if you want to say hello

70
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,560
Hello and wish her to get better soon.

71
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
Our mics are too loud?

72
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
I turned them down.

73
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,560
Are they too loud?

74
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
I turned them down.

75
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Oh, they're too loud!

76
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
Stop it.

77
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Sorry.

78
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
Thank you for that.

79
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,680
I haven't even introduced everyone yet.

80
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
I think they all know.

81
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
Ah, well.

82
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
We've got to do the introduction.

83
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
Okay, let's do the introduction.

84
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,400
Okay, Jamie's out sick, but she's in our chat room, www.calibomani.com, click on Orange

85
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,480
Lounge and click on chat.

86
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:02,320
Say hello, wish her to get better soon, and watch her berate you over typing instead of

87
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,560
verbally tonight.

88
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,560
Alright.

89
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
Okay.

90
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,320
In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

91
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,780
Hello again.

92
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,720
Not only are we sick, but we're bitchy and irritable.

93
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,840
How is it any different than usual?

94
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,920
He said hello.

95
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,960
He did, kind of.

96
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,680
Also with us tonight, filling in because he's so generous for the lack of a third person

97
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
tonight.

98
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Say hello to Lanky Style.

99
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
Also known as Brad.

100
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,680
Hello, Lankystein.

101
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,680
Also known as Brad.

102
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,680
And then in that corner, say hello to Brad Lee.

103
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,680
And also known as Arcadia42.

104
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,680
Oh, no.

105
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
How are you doing, Bradley?

106
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
OK.

107
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
Good.

108
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
Usually we'd still have music playing right now, but I fucked up.

109
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,680
He can talk.

110
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
He can sing.

111
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
Wait, I think I can get music back now.

112
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,680
Hold on.

113
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
Hold on.

114
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Yes, there we go.

115
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,680
We'll be talking to all of them more a bit later, but first, we're going to take a quick break.

116
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,680
Don't do that. Don't do that, stupid wacky DJ stuff.

117
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,680
I honestly don't know how we're going to make it three hours tonight. I really don't.

118
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,680
Toki says he's got the ideas.

119
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,680
I think I'm just going to turn this show over to Brad.

120
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,680
What? Which one? Bradley? Okay, here, Bradley.

121
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,680
Both of you.

122
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Come here.

123
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,680
Just sit there and smoke all night and get the sound effects of cigarettes burning.

124
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,680
Hooray.

125
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,680
Oh, Loki wants to take the show outside.

126
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
Are you threatening me?

127
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,680
No, we can't go outside.

128
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,680
Then we won't get the outdoors sick.

129
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,680
We'll get kicked out of the apartment complex.

130
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
All right, we'll be back.

131
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,680
We've got the money news.

132
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,680
How was your week?

133
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
How was your day?

134
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,680
Cage match, FUs, all that fun stuff coming up.

135
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,680
We'll be back.

136
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:04,680
Will I ever love you again?

137
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:11,680
Will we be together again?

138
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,680
Thought the love we had was strong

139
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:25,680
Tell me what's wrong, where did we go wrong?

140
00:07:48,680 --> 00:08:12,880
Will I, will I, will I Will I, will I, will I

141
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:20,880
Will we be together again?

142
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,880
Thought the one we had was strong

143
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,880
And tell me what's wrong

144
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,880
Where did we go wrong?

145
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,880
You've got your finger on the trigger

146
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,880
Are you gonna shoot me down?

147
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,880
You put the wallet in the chamber

148
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,880
But this time I'm gonna hit the ground

149
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,880
All I wanted was a lover

150
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,880
Someone who could hold me close

151
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,880
Now you've gone and found another

152
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,880
Blow my heart away

153
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,880
Blow my heart away, blow my heart away

154
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,880
You gotta blow my heart away

155
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Blow my heart away, blow my heart away You've gotta blow my heart away

156
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:41,880
Now you've got me where you want me I've cut my back against the wall

157
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:49,880
You stand here with a smoking gun This time I'm heading for a fall

158
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:56,880
You've got your finger on the trigger Are you gonna shoot me down?

159
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,880
All I wanted was a lover Someone who could hold me close

160
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:12,880
Now you've gone and found another And blown my heart away

161
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Go far away, go far away

162
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:23,680
Hey!

163
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
Give me ecstasy

164
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:54,260
Mwah.

165
00:11:54,260 --> 00:12:00,040
Mwah.

166
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,640
Mwah.

167
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:10,140
Mwah.

168
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:16,280
S catalyst.

169
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
Yeah.

170
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,280
Oh, ass!

171
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:24,560
This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

172
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,760
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, all ye faithful listeners.

173
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,280
You know what's funny?

174
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,600
During that break, I'd say, you know what's funny?

175
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,480
I looked at the numbers of how many people are listening to the station as we were on

176
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,000
break, and I'd say about 15% of them dropped, because they probably heard that intro where

177
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,240
We're just like we're sick, and we don't give a fuck today, and they're probably just like fuck it

178
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,700
It's gonna be one of those shows fuck it

179
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,560
So thank you guys for sticking on board ye faithful ones

180
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,960
That or just live 365 servers drop them or they're just hardcore Jamie fans, and they're pissed that she's not here tonight

181
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,760
I don't know that too, but we will most likely that's what it is

182
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,680
There's going to be a special appearance by Jamie in one way or another we're trying to work something out because she's in the chat room

183
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,480
She's cammy. How do you have a special appearance? I had to jump through the matrix

184
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,480
Yeah, something like that.

185
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,480
We'll see if we can arrange something later.

186
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,480
We'll see if we can arrange a special visit by a sick Jamie.

187
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,480
And when she's sick, she's twice as bitchy, so if we can get her in for the FUs, that'll be great.

188
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
So, anyway...

189
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
Are we doing any work?

190
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,480
No, it won't require you doing any work. You're fine.

191
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,480
Because you're sick too, Loki, and I don't want you to have to do work.

192
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
I'm not that sick.

193
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
Oh, you're not that sick? Oh, great.

194
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,480
Why don't you do the show while I go take a nap?

195
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,480
You sick bastards.

196
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,480
That's right, I don't get to take a nap because I was playing video games all day.

197
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,480
I was playing Final Fantasy X all day long.

198
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,480
Whoop-de-freakin'-doo.

199
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
Whoop-de-freakin'-doo, I know.

200
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,480
Good for you, Wrenple, who have American PS2s and can play that game.

201
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,480
For those of you who don't follow along or...

202
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,480
I don't know if I've talked about it on Orange House Radio.

203
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:07,480
I know I've talked about this plenty on Vanilla Sky on the Monday night show, but I've been rekindling my interest in Final Fantasy X lately.

204
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
I don't know, I'm about a year and a half late.

205
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:15,480
But for some reason I decided I wanted to play it and beat it, so that's what I'm doing right now, is I'm working my way through it.

206
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,480
Someday I should go ahead and beat Final Fantasy IX.

207
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,480
I never beat IX and I never beat VIII.

208
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,480
We probably should tackle that someday.

209
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
One of these days.

210
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:32,480
It's like the last Final Fantasy I actually had the patience to beat was VII, and VIII turned me off to Final Fantasy so bad that I didn't even buy IX.

211
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,480
But you didn't even go to Sea Spirits within, did you?

212
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,480
No, I went to Sea Spirits within, and it made me even sadder.

213
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:45,480
So, on that note, let's play How Was Your Week and How Was Your Day?

214
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,080
Sacramento, and I don't like the fact that jury duty is in downtown Sacramento.

215
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,520
And the whole week sucked, it was hell, and it would be nice to say, oh well you know,

216
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,680
jury duty is done, so I get to go back to my work, but no, I have to go for the next

217
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,400
least two days.

218
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:33,700
So that sucks, and I don't want to be there, but I got to sit through it and do my quote

219
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,700
civil duty

220
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,700
civic duty

221
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,700
I don't give a crap

222
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,700
Think of the car, Honda

223
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,700
So, you know, that's why I gotta do that

224
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,700
it wasn't my week, it sucked

225
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,700
I had the worst day ever on Wednesday, I just didn't care when I got back

226
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,700
and then Thursday was alright because we got off at noon

227
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
because they're still picking the jury

228
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,700
because it's slow

229
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,700
and then, um

230
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,700
yeah, none of those other things

231
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,700
They didn't say, sorry, go home?

232
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,700
No, they actually put me on there.

233
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,700
Wow, I got kicked off when I was a kid.

234
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,700
Well, they still have to go through pretty much the way I figured, because I've never

235
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,700
really been in one of these things.

236
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,700
They've got 27 people they pick first, they go in there, and then they kind of go through

237
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:29,700
and eliminate people until those 27 people are all gone or either in the jury box.

238
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:34,740
There's like still another, you know, they've only eliminated like four people so far and

239
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,860
there's still like another 13 people in the audience still or whatever.

240
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,860
Geez.

241
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:45,620
You know, and so, I mean, there's a chance that, you know, I might get kicked off, but

242
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,420
probably not because my luck never runs away.

243
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,420
That's crazy.

244
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,420
So.

245
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,680
Four people a day.

246
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:59,300
It's supposed to only take two hours and it's taken like three so far over the course of

247
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,840
a few days, actually more than three, because we had to, let's see, they were doing it for

248
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:12,520
about a day or so on Wednesday. They were doing it for about an hour, because we got

249
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:19,580
in there really late in the day. So they were doing it for about an hour, and then on Thursday

250
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:27,340
they did it from 9.30 to 12. And they still haven't eliminated how the people, because

251
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:54,780
Didn't you mention when you were on the stand or whatever that you actually did a show called

252
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:00,520
Orange Lounge Radio that you are a part of? Yes. Great. The government knows about us.

253
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,740
We are fucked. I don't think they care. Oh my God, you said that. It was funny though

254
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:12,860
because the prosecution, or no, the defense attorney asked me as one of the questions,

255
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,740
because they are pulling you and asking questions when you are on the box, because I was talking

256
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,740
about, they are all, so what kind of music do you guys play? I am like, I play like trance,

257
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,180
dance music, J-pop, and just went down a whole list.

258
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,340
And then the next question was, what's J-pop?

259
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,420
And I responded, I'm like, it's kind of like hyper, very

260
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,540
high energy, kind of annoying.

261
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,860
And that got everyone laughing.

262
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,540
That was funny.

263
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,620
So you said you were actually on a, did you say you had talk

264
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,900
radio on the microphone radio?

265
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,060
Yeah, and I think I would take that as, OK, we shouldn't have

266
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,980
them on the jury, because you might go ahead talking about

267
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,180
the thing.

268
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,100
Well, I mentioned it as a talk radio station.

269
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:55,100
I also, what was it, I mentioned, I was going into it, I guess I went into it a little too much, because the judge is like,

270
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,100
Did you want to give out your URL while you're at it?

271
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,100
Did you?

272
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,100
No.

273
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,100
Damn it!

274
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,100
Holy shit, that would have been great.

275
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:15,100
No, but, damn it, why didn't you have the business cards? We have the business cards, you could offer the judge a business card, you would have gotten kicked off the jury right there, come on.

276
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,100
And he would have had our URL.

277
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,100
No, I'd rather not.

278
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,100
But anyways, the defense attorney, though, she knew what we were talking about.

279
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,100
She's like, oh, so what kind of video games do you guys talk about?

280
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100
I'm like, oh, mostly the music games.

281
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,100
She's like, oh, like that game where you step on the arrows?

282
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,100
Wait, wait.

283
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,100
I just have to ask real fast.

284
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Did you have to define what speed music was?

285
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,100
No, I did not.

286
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,100
It's a bunch of crap.

287
00:19:44,100 --> 00:20:03,540
Which is ironic because that's the company that my very first website was hosted on.

288
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,540
Well, I gave them the URL to listen to us, but...

289
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,540
Ah, see, you didn't give out the URL.

290
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,540
It's a web person.

291
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:15,540
I didn't give it out to the whole jury because half of those people I don't think know what a computer is.

292
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,540
Were you being interviewed in front of the other jury members that were going to be interviewed?

293
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,540
Oh yeah, the whole people.

294
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,540
How many people were there?

295
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,540
I don't know, 27.

296
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,540
That's all?

297
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:37,540
Well, not including the attorneys, the defense, the defendant, and all the judge, the bailiff.

298
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,540
So basically you have no shame.

299
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,540
No.

300
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,540
I couldn't get up on the stand and say that I do those things. Sorry.

301
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:50,540
I'd so be ashamed of this because they come on here and they find out what a big fag I am in like 15 seconds.

302
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,540
I don't know, for some reason-

303
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,540
Wait, did they kick you off the jury for being a homosexual?

304
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,540
No.

305
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,540
Maybe if the case has something to do with that.

306
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:05,540
Usually they'll pick a jury when they ask you questions and they're looking for things that may give you a biased opinion during the jury.

307
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,540
But here's the thing though, it's like-

308
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:12,540
I don't understand about much- I don't know much about how the jury system works and everything, but

309
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:17,540
it was like they were almost telling people what their answers are.

310
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:23,740
are. Would this make you biased in any way? And it's basically like, unless I sat there

311
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:29,380
and go, yes, yes, yes, yes, pretty much asking, hey, who wants to leave? It's pretty much

312
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,940
like that. And they would keep asking the same question until they finally said no.

313
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,180
It's because they can't lead the witnesses in the case, so they just lead the jury members

314
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:47,180
to pick the ones they want. It's a very slow process, very slow. And I hope that God, it

315
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:53,120
I know that we actually start the trial on Monday because, I mean, first off, Wednesday

316
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
was boring as hell.

317
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,820
You go in and you have to wait for a trial to open up.

318
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,820
So we got one.

319
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,540
I was the first one called or I was in the first group called for a trial.

320
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,560
I was like, oh, sweet, you know, because we're getting to a trial, get it going, get the

321
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,700
hell out of here, you know.

322
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,220
No, wait for an hour, hour, they settled.

323
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,040
Okay, so we go back into the stupid room watching Fox News all day.

324
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,640
And so, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, lunch comes, waiting, waiting, waiting,

325
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,640
waiting.

326
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,640
It's almost time to go home.

327
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,640
It's 3 o'clock.

328
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,480
We get to leave at 3.30 if we're not called in and we're done.

329
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,480
We're done for good.

330
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,200
So, as you would know, at 3.15, they call in the last group and my name is the last

331
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,120
one called on that group.

332
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,520
So, it's like, fuck.

333
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,640
I'm like, okay, settle, settle, settle, settle, no.

334
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,880
I hope you get sequestered.

335
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,200
That would be funny.

336
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,320
It's not going to happen.

337
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,900
I don't think so.

338
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,800
What little I did find out about what's going on, it's not that big deal.

339
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:02,160
Well, I mean, to somebody it's a big deal, but it's not going to be on the news or anything.

340
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,760
We're not talking like a high profile case, it's just, eh.

341
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,760
Well yeah, you would have been able to tail as soon as you went in there.

342
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,760
They have a completely different type of process and they do that kind of thing.

343
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,760
I don't know, I just want to be out of there.

344
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,760
You know, it's not a matter of like, I don't like jury duty, it's fine.

345
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,760
I just really hate downtown SAC.

346
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,760
I hate driving down there.

347
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,760
I honestly, I hate everything about downtown SAC.

348
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,760
It is impossible to find any place to eat down by the jury place.

349
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,760
I walked around blocks just looking for a restaurant.

350
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,760
It just sucks.

351
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:40,760
And then, you know, in fact, I have to get there two hours early in order to get parking space, you know, a free parking space.

352
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,760
Otherwise, I have to pay $6 a day, you know, for parking.

353
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,760
Yeah, for parking?

354
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
No, they don't.

355
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,760
Yeah, way to go to the city of Sacramento, you rock.

356
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:57,760
You know, not only do you pay me only $15 to go to jury duty, but half that money is going to go to parking because you don't provide enough parking.

357
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,760
How fucking lame.

358
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,760
But it'll all be over soon.

359
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,800
I'm on vacation next week.

360
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,520
No, I'd be like, my work's not going to pay me.

361
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,040
You find out what the case is about,

362
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,840
and then you make the most stupid statement

363
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,440
that make them totally think that you'd

364
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,840
be the wrong person to pick.

365
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,560
Say it's about a gay person being beaten up,

366
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,120
then you say that you're a freaking anti-gay.

367
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,360
It doesn't work that way.

368
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,280
It doesn't work that way, because they tell you

369
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,480
from the beginning what the case is going to be about.

370
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:09,480
It's really the whole system is flawed the way they do it, but I guess it works because they have so many trials a day.

371
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:21,480
It doesn't make any sense because any idiot can find a way out of it. It's just on the honor system, which isn't worth much nowadays.

372
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,340
I don't know how, I guess I was just too young because I think I got called in like on my

373
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,340
18th birthday.

374
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:31,180
I mean, I swear it was like as soon as I could go to jury duty, I was called and they were

375
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,980
just like, I think they just thought I was too young and they sent me home.

376
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,980
I was like, thank goodness.

377
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,980
I don't want to be here.

378
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:41,180
Well, it's like there are people like they're all, I don't even know how they could have

379
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,180
a hardship.

380
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:46,500
You know, the trials going to like last like two days, you know, once they get the jury

381
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,300
selected and you're like, oh, poor me, poor me.

382
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,980
I'm not going to have enough money to make rent, because I missed two days of work.

383
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,980
Well, that's kind of how it is for some people.

384
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,980
Oh, well.

385
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:04,020
I mean, and you miss rent, and you fucking, it could script your life, I mean, it's not

386
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,020
just any laughing matter.

387
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:11,940
I think it's a bunch of bullshit, the way they have us set up, so anyway.

388
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,140
Rice Princess is suggesting if you wanted to get out of jury duty, you could have told

389
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:22,740
them that you make sweet love to sheep. That doesn't have anything to do with the trial

390
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:27,380
though, so that wouldn't work. Yeah, how would they ever find a juror in Chico if that's

391
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,560
the case? That's what I want to know. Anyway, anything else you want to say about your day

392
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:39,320
and your week? No, I really didn't do much. I just was like so preoccupied with the stupid

393
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:45,840
jury crap that's like, didn't really have a very good week and didn't get any work done

394
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:52,360
on my cabinet, which kind of sucks. I thought it was going to rain today when I looked outside,

395
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:59,080
but according to the weather, it's not going to rain for a while. And I don't know. It's

396
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:04,360
just supposed to get warmer. It's supposed to be like 90s. Ew. But I don't know. I'm

397
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:14,360
I'm just pretty much just doing like running around stuff today. I went grocery shopping because I needed to do that and that's about it.

398
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,360
Supposed to try to find a Halloween costume because I had to go to a party. I don't know, I'm good.

399
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,360
You haven't figured out what you're dressing up as yet?

400
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:27,360
I had an idea, but there's just a problem is no one seems to have the costume that I want. I had a couple ideas.

401
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,360
It was the Mad Hatter, which is kind of cool.

402
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,360
Just do like an evil Mad Hatter type thing.

403
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,360
I probably do that and it's like eh.

404
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,360
I could dress up like Neo from the Matrix because I already have a trench coat and glasses,

405
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,360
but really it's the wrong kind of trench coat and stuff.

406
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,360
My other one was the charred corpse of an astronaut.

407
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,360
You are horrible.

408
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,360
So I thought that would be kind of cool because all you have to do is find an astronaut costume.

409
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,360
I know you'd be surprised if there's not that many out there. I guess no one wants to dress up like an astronaut this year.

410
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,360
I hope you wouldn't be seen in public with that on because you'd get beat up by somebody.

411
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,360
Oh, by the astronauts? Wait, they can't because they're charred corpses.

412
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:13,360
You're horrible.

413
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,360
I said you should have been a princess because that would be ironic.

414
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,960
My co-workers supposed to dress up like a dominatrix. That's kind of cool except. She doesn't she wouldn't be a good dominatrix

415
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,280
Now how our other co-workers the slut she be a good dominatrix

416
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,260
But that's all okay, don't give me the microphone um after comments I got it

417
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:44,560
I'll I'll talk about my day in my week, but first I have to address the chat room because they're talking about me in there

418
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:54,720
I look like absolute shit today and I don't even know why I'm sitting on the cam.

419
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,120
I should take the opportunity to sit in Jamie's hidden blue chair while she's not here, but

420
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,880
for whatever reason I'm lazy and I don't feel like getting up on the couch.

421
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:08,040
And I look really ugly today because I haven't really taken a shower and my hair is like

422
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:12,960
half spiked because I didn't bother to do my hair today and I look like I rolled out

423
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,240
I know that's right. It's really too disgusting to say on that way. That's a good bread

424
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,520
Anyway, dissing you you're not supposed to say that's good. I

425
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,980
Just I don't want to talk about ha ha jokes on you. I don't want to go there

426
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,960
Any why?

427
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,760
the rest of my week

428
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,760
Was really pretty boring

429
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,480
Tuesday and Wednesday was DDR extreme most of the afternoon because we finally picked it up on Tuesday

430
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,240
But we'll get we'll get into that later. We'll talk about DDR extremely

431
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:21,240
Yeah, I was so bored on Thursday, I played that damn game all day, and you know what, that's the only time I'll ever play that damn game, so it was nice while it lasted.

432
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,240
Extreme is disappointing. Very disappointing.

433
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
We'll get to that later.

434
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,240
Oh, we are?

435
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,240
Yeah, well, we need topics to fill three hours, so let's not blow our load all at once here, please.

436
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,240
You're a dick.

437
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,240
Anyway, and then Thursday I started feeling sick, so I didn't really want to do shit after that,

438
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,200
after that because Thursday I had to go run errands out in Roseville. I didn't even bother

439
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:50,320
to go by Golf Land. And then, God, what the hell. I was supposed to go out.

440
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,440
You were just being more exciting for them. I usually go out Thursday night and I didn't

441
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,960
because I was feeling sick. You know what, I did go out last night though. I went out

442
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,640
dancing last night. And it was kind of interesting because I was hearing all these new Bamani

443
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,800
songs that they were playing. Like the DJ at the club last night. Oh no, I'm Friday

444
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,920
night. Friday night. I meant Friday night, not last night.

445
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:15,220
My bad. Friday night I went out and the DJ there was really, really horrible. He was

446
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:21,560
mixing songs together. Not how most DJs mix songs together, how they transition one song

447
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,560
into another.

448
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Oh, like I do.

449
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,280
Yeah, but no, it was different.

450
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,000
He put gravity in the background.

451
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,440
Yeah, no, he wasn't mixing gravity in the background either. He didn't put any thought

452
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,320
into it. He would just mix two records together on top of each other.

453
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,320
Oh, like I do.

454
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,320
But, like, no, what's funny is that I'm thinking about all these, like, new Bimani songs he

455
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,320
was playing.

456
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,760
He was playing a song that's going to be in DDRXBox, that shiny disco ball song, which

457
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,680
I know we talked about a couple weeks ago on here.

458
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,200
And then he was playing Sandstorm, too.

459
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,720
And he was, like, mixing these two songs together.

460
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,140
It really, really sucked.

461
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,140
Like it was...

462
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:58,680
Late night, disco ball.

463
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:03,680
Shiny disco ball, late night, booty call.

464
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,680
That's really awful.

465
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,680
He was obviously new.

466
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,680
Why don't you just let them move in the background?

467
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,680
You could be a DJ at a gay bar so easy.

468
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,680
Hey, what do you mean by that?

469
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,680
I just mean, you know, because you like gay music.

470
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,680
Hey!

471
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,680
I'm just kidding.

472
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,680
My music is pure hetero.

473
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,680
You're the only straight guy I know with a Madonna vinyl.

474
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,680
It's not a professional DJ already.

475
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,680
I have more than one. I have like three or four of them.

476
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,680
You're just making my point.

477
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:42,680
It's the, um, my girl likes to party all the time record that really scares me.

478
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,680
Okay, well I guess I'm guilty there.

479
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
He says he's guilty there.

480
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,680
Yeah, but that's not, that's not gay, that's just stupid.

481
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,680
That is so gay.

482
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,680
That's stupid.

483
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,680
Well, apparently you didn't answer that video.

484
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,680
Exactly.

485
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:56,680
And you're gay, and you're stupid, so it works.

486
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:09,680
I was hearing a ton of new Bimani songs at the club.

487
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,220
I heard Love at First Sight, Stomp to My Beat, you know all these ones that you hear in-

488
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,500
Well, they're not really Bimani songs.

489
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:20,260
They're not, but you know, it's still neat to sit there and go, oh my god, it's in DDR!

490
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,260
I don't know.

491
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,260
No.

492
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,260
It's not quite what it used to be.

493
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,460
When he plays Max Period, I'll be like, okay.

494
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,460
Yeah, you're right.

495
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:35,800
You're never going to hear a Konami original there, but I remember when I was first getting

496
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:45,120
into DDR, back when DDR USA was the only game there was to play, I remember going out to

497
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,260
the club with a couple of Bahmani friends and we heard Stomp to My Beat and it was like

498
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,260
yeah!

499
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,960
Am I the only person who heard Stomp to My Beat before it came out on DVD?

500
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
I had heard it before, too, but it got better.

501
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,960
We used to listen to it all the time when we played QZAR.

502
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:08,320
Yeah, I mean, they used to play it on power 105.5 here all the time, which is just a local

503
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,960
thing to say, but I had a radio station.

504
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,000
There was a radio station that used to play dance music, and it was big before DDR was

505
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
around.

506
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It was awesome.

507
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And too bad the damn station isn't around anymore.

508
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,280
It was the best station this town ever had.

509
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,960
No, it's power 105.5 the fish.

510
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,560
No, it's power 105.5 the fish.

511
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,960
But it used to be Car 105, and they would play all this really good dance music, and

512
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,400
like, I bet you anything, in fact, I'm almost positive, I am like, that I heard Do It All

513
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,280
Night by Erotic on that station, before I ever heard it in DDR, because when I heard

514
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,560
it in DDR, I was like, I know I've heard this song somewhere before.

515
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,880
It's possible, I mean, because they are, uh, a European, um, dance place.

516
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,160
Anyway, hi, I'm off on a tangent, let me come back down.

517
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:52,040
What you were saying is something about playing, when we go to the club, and now it's in DDR,

518
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,440
So now we already like Stomp to My Beat, now it's a DDR, and we'd be at the club and we'd

519
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,920
actually do the dance, like we do it where we go step, step, step, step, step, just like

520
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,560
it was in Stomp to My Beat.

521
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,280
Like doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, left, left, left, down, anyway.

522
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,280
I'll shut up now.

523
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,280
I'm leaving.

524
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,280
No!

525
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,280
You scare me.

526
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,280
No!

527
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,280
All right.

528
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,560
So you did Riverdance, basically.

529
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,640
Riceprincess says that the first time she heard Stomp to My Beat was when she went to

530
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,640
go watch strippers.

531
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,640
I don't know if that's the first.

532
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,640
That's kind of weird, though, to have them play that in a strip club.

533
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,640
Hey.

534
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,640
Stomp to my be- stomp on my face.

535
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,640
I mean, I don't get it.

536
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,640
Sit on my face, she was sitting on my face.

537
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,640
Okay, that was really bad.

538
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,640
Stomp on my cock.

539
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,640
Stomp on my cock, he says.

540
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,640
No, thank you.

541
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,640
I guess I'm done.

542
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:56,120
I think that's it yeah oh oh Jamie's reminded me of another time we heard

543
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,120
stomp to my beat it was when um you remember when we like the all the

544
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,280
Sacramento people used to go to Roswell Golf Land every like Thursday night or

545
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,920
Wednesday night it was one of the two nights we used to go here once I 30 one

546
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,560
time we were at Brookfield's we heard stop to my beat in the kitchen and if we

547
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,840
had it oh my god it's DDR moment all right I'll shut up now

548
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,840
Brad! How was your day? How was your week?

549
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,840
Really?

550
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
That's pretty much it.

551
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:33,840
No, uh, fuck, nothing really. I just, I've been playing PSO. I don't know why. I just had this urge to play PSO again.

552
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,840
And not online, because I'm playing on Dreamcast.

553
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,840
And that would be Phantasy Star Online for the uninitiated.

554
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,840
If anybody doesn't know what PSO is, there's something wrong.

555
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:51,840
That's like saying, what's Aro? What the fuck? What's EQ? What's L-O-Z? What's that?

556
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,840
EQ. That's that magazine for men, right? Is it? I don't know.

557
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:03,840
You're thinking XY. Anyway. Oh, GQ. I get it. No, so I've been playing that for some reason.

558
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:08,840
I don't know. And reading Harry Potter because I'm way behind. Yes, I'm going to admit it.

559
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:16,520
I read Harry Potter, I am hooked on the Harry Potter books, I'm a little late, but hey,

560
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,520
they're good.

561
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,920
You have a weak mind, you've been sucked into the Harry Potter books.

562
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,920
They're actually very good books.

563
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,920
No, I know.

564
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,920
I know.

565
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,080
Okay, I remember when the first book came out and hardly anybody knew about the book.

566
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,480
Only my friend's little brother was reading it and it started to get bigger and bigger

567
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,360
and I was like, what is this thing?

568
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:41,100
Then he had this Harry Potter birthday party where all of his friends decorated the house

569
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,120
like a Hogwarts, if you know what that is.

570
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,040
I'm pretty sure most people know because it's in the movie.

571
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,320
And I was just like, what is this?

572
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,320
This is so stupid.

573
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,840
And then by the time I know it, everybody's reading it and I'm still skeptic about it

574
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,080
and the fourth book is out and I'm just like, whatever.

575
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:03,160
And then Jamie, thank you Jamie, she buys, Irene and I, the box set of the four books,

576
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,920
That fifth book hadn't come out yet, and we had watched the first movie, and I really

577
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,920
liked it.

578
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,960
We watched the second movie, and I finally got around to reading the books, and the books

579
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,440
are so not kids' books.

580
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,040
They're geared towards kids, but I think there's a lot of things in the books that kids wouldn't

581
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
even understand.

582
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:25,360
Really, some of it's pretty complicated, so good stuff.

583
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,280
No, there's no hardcore sex, Loki.

584
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,680
I'm not reading that.

585
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,680
Well, actually, I don't know.

586
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,640
I haven't gotten all the way through the fourth book yet.

587
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,640
I'm thinking of Harry Cooder, not Harry Potter.

588
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,640
Harry Cooder.

589
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:45,640
Yeah, I haven't gotten all the way through the fourth or fifth book, so I don't know. I can't say, but I'm sure there's a lot of people out there listening right now who have even read them all, so...

590
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,640
Whatever. No spoilers for me.

591
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:53,640
I'll just wait till the movie comes out and you can see Harry Potter having sex with Hermione while Ron sticks him up the ass.

592
00:38:53,640 --> 00:39:16,740
I have searched for pictures for the new movie coming out, the third movie on Harry Potter.

593
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,840
What comes up on Google Images?

594
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:28,880
Harry Potter doujinshis, which are like pornographic mangas.

595
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,760
Maybe you spelled Harry Potter wrong.

596
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,320
I don't even know why people bother.

597
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,400
Look at what Mario and Luigi look like when they're having anal sex.

598
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,040
Is that all you have to say, Brad?

599
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,040
Yeah, pretty much.

600
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,520
Alright, then let's ask Bradley.

601
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
How was your day?

602
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,520
How was your week?

603
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,520
Hey!

604
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,520
How's it going?

605
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:58,980
On Monday through Wednesday I actually did some work for one place, but basically I had

606
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:04,760
a big stack of papers, one was in order and one was not, so I had to take one stack and

607
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,680
reorder it to get it ready to put with the other papers so that we could stuff it in

608
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,680
envelopes.

609
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,680
So you got paid to shuffle papers?

610
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,120
Yeah, shuffle papers and throw them into envelopes.

611
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:23,520
That took three days, and doing that hurts your shoulders.

612
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,280
And that's where they had a little bit more data entry, and then that was it for that

613
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,280
place.

614
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,560
And then Thursday, Friday, didn't do very much.

615
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:38,280
Monday my cable got cut off because I haven't paid them yet for a while, so I'm going to

616
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:45,040
dial up for a while, which sucks, sucks majorly, especially if you need to have people calling

617
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,340
sometime for maybe interviews or something, so I have to like keep it off during the day

618
00:40:50,340 --> 00:41:00,080
when I have to like take everything. So that's kind of a bitch. Saturday went around shopping

619
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:07,280
and such. And the limited money I have. What did you buy? Oh, just some like detergent

620
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:13,560
and like dishwasher. Day-to-day necessities. I know, because everybody out there listening

621
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,560
I want to know what kind of detergent you use.

622
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,560
Cascade.

623
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,560
Cascade?

624
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,560
Wait, wait, wait.

625
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
For dishwasher detergent?

626
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,560
Yeah, yeah.

627
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,560
I have a...

628
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,640
This will help everybody out there who has an apartment or house and actually has to

629
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:34,540
do dishes, do not buy any name brand detergent for your fucking dishwasher.

630
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:42,060
I found out that Walmart brand Sam's Choice detergent from Walmart is better and cheaper

631
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,660
than any other detergents out there.

632
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,580
And I have used pretty much every freaking kind

633
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,100
of dishwasher detergent.

634
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,680
I used to use Electrosol, Cascade.

635
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,880
It would not clean anything.

636
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,680
Even if I cleaned the dishes before I cleaned the dishes,

637
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,280
it still did not clean them.

638
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,060
But the Walmart, the Sam's Choice detergent

639
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,300
fucking kicks ass.

640
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,300
It's cheap, too.

641
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,980
Wait, there's two hands grabbing from the mic.

642
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,100
This is the most uninteresting topic ever,

643
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,720
but I'm actually interested here.

644
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,620
So you just know this based upon experience,

645
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,740
or do you have the scientific data to back it up?

646
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:18,780
I found the idea from, they did a news report on why can't they basically get, this is how

647
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,240
boring our local news stations are.

648
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,700
We can't figure out, they do this will it work Wednesdays thing or whatever and they

649
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,000
try to see like which, they compare products to see if they really work well.

650
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,620
And they were saying, you know, here's the expensive brands and they did like tests.

651
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:35,100
And now I don't know if they made the fake tests or not, you know, but basically they

652
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:39,940
said their opinion was to use this specific brand, this Walmart Sam's Choice brand.

653
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,780
I mean, I don't know if they're faking the test or not, but I said, I'll give it a shot.

654
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,360
And I have had nothing but bad results with other, I always thought it was my dishwasher

655
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,420
that couldn't fucking wash the dishes.

656
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,300
But no, I go, I buy the Sam's Choice stuff, and it works better than any other kind of

657
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,940
detergent I've ever used.

658
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,820
Probably because it has toxic substances in it, but who knows?

659
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,820
Who cares?

660
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,940
Yeah, go about killing the earth.

661
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,900
Your dishes come out with a nice glow to them.

662
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,900
Yeah.

663
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,260
Thanks for killing the earth, Brad.

664
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,260
I know.

665
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:16,260
I am single-handedly destroying this planet, and I feel good about it.

666
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:20,420
Because I can eat off a clean plate, so fuck you.

667
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,460
Even if my turkeys grow three eyes.

668
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:26,540
Wait, turkeys, I don't know, here.

669
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:31,180
If turkeys are growing extra limbs, that just means more food for me.

670
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,780
There's nothing wrong with that.

671
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:37,900
Supposedly that's how KFC makes their chickens.

672
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:43,380
They have like no feathers, no beaks, huge bodies and tiny little legs.

673
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,460
KFC is doing something fucked up because we all ate there the other day and I swear to

674
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:51,780
God we were all like this afterwards, we were all clutching our stomachs and going, chemical

675
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,260
poisoning.

676
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,060
It's not the chemical poisoning.

677
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:00,620
You're merely reacting to the nice grease layer that's on the chicken to help ease its

678
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,620
digestion.

679
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:07,020
Unfortunately, a lot of our bodies aren't used to that amount of grease.

680
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:12,500
So you know the fact that the chickens are mutants that might also have a fact, a factor

681
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,500
for that.

682
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,340
But no, I think I was sick because I was like starving, I hadn't eaten anything all day

683
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:22,820
except for popcorn, a full thing of popcorn and then I had a bunch of chicken.

684
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:29,700
And then later on that night, I had a really hard parmesan twist from round table that

685
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,220
were sitting out on the counter for three days.

686
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:38,160
And then after that, I'm all clenching my chest, going, why am I not feeling good?

687
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:44,500
So lesson for life, kids, don't start off the day with eating a bucket of popcorn.

688
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,940
It's never a good way to start.

689
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,940
Yeah.

690
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:53,620
Were you done talking about your day and your week, Bradley?

691
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:59,140
And yeah, I didn't do all that much other than Wednesday coming over here and playing

692
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,140
some DDR Extreme.

693
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,160
That's right.

694
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:13,180
I forgot to add one thing about my week and my day, and that is that yesterday morning

695
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,220
I went and saw Kill Bill for the third time.

696
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,220
Thank you.

697
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,220
Shut up!

698
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,220
You were with me!

699
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,220
Screw you!

700
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,320
I know we missed the pyramid tryouts because we had to go see Kill Bill again, so what

701
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,320
can you do?

702
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,780
But Kill Bill was just as good the third time, and I will be going to see it at least the

703
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,900
a fourth time if not fifth and sixth because I'm sick.

704
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:39,140
So anyway, before we get to the break, I got over the chat room a message from Jamie.

705
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,780
She would like to share how her week and her day was.

706
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,940
So Jamie, how was your day?

707
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,220
How was your week?

708
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:48,380
Well, Jamie says, my week equals work.

709
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,860
My day equals suck.

710
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:56,300
And no Bomani, because I'm being frugal.

711
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,300
There you go.

712
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:03,100
Alright, if no one else has anything to say for right now, we're going to take a quick

713
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,820
break and we're going to come back and we're going to talk about DDR Extreme because we

714
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:10,740
all got to play it this week and we certainly have a lot to say about it, so we'll get to

715
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,740
that when we come back.

716
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:18,260
In the meantime, enjoy this break, we'll have some Casey and the Sunshine Band from Max2USA

717
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:25,260
the way to Shawn the Hornymaster. We'll be back.

718
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:55,260
Make a little love, get down tonight, get down tonight

719
00:46:55,260 --> 00:47:03,260
Baby babe, I'll meet you at the same place, same time

720
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:12,260
Where we can all get together and ease up all my love

721
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,780
I take it

722
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,020
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

723
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,020
Get out, get out, get out

724
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,020
Oh

725
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,020
Yeah!

726
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,620
Yeah!

727
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:02,420
Yeah!

728
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,020
I did it!

729
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,020
I did it!

730
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,020
I'll be there

731
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,020
I'll be there

732
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:33,900
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

733
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:37,940
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

734
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:43,700
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

735
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,000
Howdy, folks.

736
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:45,500
We're back.

737
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:49,780
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 65,

738
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:50,820
the sick episode.

739
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:54,060
Because Jamie's out sick tonight.

740
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:57,980
She would have tried to really just push herself.

741
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,380
And my phone's ringing.

742
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:01,220
She would have really tried to push herself

743
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:01,920
and come in tonight.

744
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,300
But the problem is then she would

745
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,560
have been even worse off at work tomorrow.

746
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,660
She can't really do that because she

747
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,220
doesn't have any vacation time left because she's using it all to go to

748
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:14,980
Alabama in November I think is when she's going so yeah she's gonna be gone

749
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:19,180
for episode 69 that makes me sad how we're gonna have an episode 69 without

750
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,420
Jamie I don't know but then again maybe she's maybe she planned it that way

751
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:27,860
because we can get dirty here on orange long radio we can get very very dirty

752
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:34,020
anyway welcome back and we were talking about how was your week how was your day

753
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:38,000
before we went to break and most of us kind of had boring weeks because there's

754
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,060
not like going on hmm there's people laughing outside I wonder what that's

755
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:44,380
about I know I hear giggling maybe people are listening into the show

756
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:51,180
except we're not funny so I don't know so I don't know what's going on there

757
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:58,460
anyway oh oh you're looking through the peephole Loki huh what do you see are

758
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:03,220
Are there naked people out there?

759
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,220
Damn my phone.

760
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:08,580
Oh, is Brad talking to the neighbors?

761
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:13,780
Yeah, we have some interesting neighbors because our neighbors upstairs to the left, they're

762
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:17,600
big anime fans, so they think what we do is pretty funny.

763
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:23,660
They like to make fun of Loki and his DDR pads that he's building outside.

764
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,180
What did they say something of...

765
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:28,700
I was commenting to them the other day, something about how Loki's building his machine, and

766
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,420
I commented something like, oh yeah, they asked me where are you going to put it?

767
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:35,940
And I said, oh, well, Loki's going to get rid of the TV and kind of put it in its place

768
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,740
because the cabinet's going to be a television, too.

769
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:42,340
And they were just, they were kind of like, oh, there's nothing like watching Loki playing

770
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,340
some DDR.

771
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:46,980
Okay, it had to be there, never mind.

772
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:53,620
Anyway, okay, as promised, I wanted to talk about DDR Extreme because it came out last

773
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:57,480
Thursday, but a lot of folks in America didn't really get it till this week. You were really

774
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:01,900
lucky if you got it last week, but most of us got it this week, and we've all had a chance

775
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:05,680
to play it, so I'm just kind of curious what your guys' thoughts are on the game, so let's

776
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,840
go around and see what people think. Brad?

777
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,840
What are you talking about?

778
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,840
Are you talking about your neighbors aren't drugs?

779
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:10,840
I'm talking about the way the chat room is.

780
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:19,120
Well, because I just talked to your neighbors out there.

781
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,120
Okay.

782
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,120
I'll tell you later.

783
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,120
I'll talk about it later.

784
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,120
Anyway.

785
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:27,120
Extreme sucks.

786
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,360
I didn't really care for Extreme.

787
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:33,040
The last machine I was really ever excited about was Max 2.

788
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,240
Extreme came out of the arcade and I thought it was really cool.

789
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:42,740
put like sakura in there and and xenon and daikonkai and miracle moon led style like

790
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:48,420
those are a few good songs but the most of the songs in the machine sucked okay now the

791
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:52,480
home version comes out and i hear you know the songs that are going to be out on it the

792
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:57,560
unlocks i heard them pretty much before like i got to yeah i heard them before i got to

793
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:02,360
play the game i got to play the game the steps on all of them pretty much suck some people

794
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:07,240
People will disagree with me saying scorching moon steps are cool, I think they're being

795
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:13,640
really non-innovative with their steps still, I mean there's only so much you can do, but

796
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:18,280
still they gave them all easy difficulties except for max period, but we can talk about

797
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,280
that later.

798
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,820
Hasn't Konami kind of been doing that with all the new songs lately, I mean people were

799
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,580
bitching about Max 2 USA kind of had shitty steps too.

800
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:30,200
Well that's because those steps are made in Hawaii I believe, Konami Hawaii makes those

801
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,200
steps.

802
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,320
I understand. Konami Hawaii does everything about the Xbox. This is just how I understand

803
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,320
it. I could be wrong. From what I picked up, Konami Hawaii only does everything really

804
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,520
into the Xbox game, and I mean everything. Konami Hawaii has completely developed the

805
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:49,240
Xbox and computer versions of DDR. There's kind of a debate whether Konami USA is making

806
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:53,420
those steps or Konami Japan. Some people think it's being done in the US. Some people say

807
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:56,680
it's Japan. I guess people don't really know. There's a different style. There's obviously

808
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:01,840
a different style to the steps on the American only songs that don't show up in other Japanese

809
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:06,520
games. I can tell there's some sort of difference to them, so I'm thinking they're done by somebody

810
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:15,200
else. But still the thing is, sorry, I'm getting sidetracked by some of the stuff that's being

811
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,200
talked about.

812
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,200
Then don't look at the chat room, look at it when you're done talking.

813
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,880
Well, there's important stuff I want to talk about that they keep talking about.

814
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,880
Alright.

815
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:38,880
Anyway, the steps for these new unlocked songs were kind of ass. I love Scorching Moon. I pretty much like all of the unlocked songs on Xtreme except for Max Period, which leaves three songs.

816
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,880
I'm going to do Twask or King Moon and Stupid Barber.

817
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:48,880
Those were all good songs, and it was pretty much up to how the steps felt, and the steps didn't feel right.

818
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:56,880
Max Period was an extreme disappointment. In my opinion, it seems like they hired Bomani Ruler to make a step file for Max Period.

819
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,880
And they didn't. Don't start that rumor. That rumor is already going around.

820
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:06,880
I know, but you look at it, and it's just like, okay, let's speed up the fucking BPM to 800 BPM or whatever it is at the very end.

821
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,880
Wow, that's fun. I think they've totally jumped the shark.

822
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:16,880
No, here's what they did. They don't really know what we want.

823
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:24,880
That's why DDRXtreme was, what songs do you want? Notice all the songs that they picked, a lot of them, were sim files beforehand.

824
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:38,880
So, think about it. If I'm going to find out what people want as a sim file, or not a sim file, but a steps for Max and what I want the song, I'm going to go listen to all the sim files and mix songs. Notice-

825
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:44,880
Wait, wait. You're talking about Max 2 USA, not Xtreme, right? Because you're talking about like Heaven had like 50 sim files for it and then-

826
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,880
No, no, no, no, no. I'm talking about Xtreme. We're talking Xtreme here.

827
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,880
Okay.

828
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:57,640
Because look, Colors, A, V, those all have step charts, okay? Now look at Max Period.

829
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:05,380
It's basically, I could basically make that stupid song, okay? That song, it wasn't remixed

830
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:14,900
at all very much. And the step charts to it, it's a bunch of jumping. It's just, it was

831
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:21,460
fucking retarded. So, how are most of the max step charts in songs? They suck. So, I

832
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:24,580
guess they think that we like this kind of step charts, so that's what they gave us.

833
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:29,960
I really like the steps for max 300. I think those were really good for the song. Max Unlimited,

834
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:34,220
pretty good. Lots of jumps, but still pretty good. And then it just started going downhill.

835
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:38,980
Legend of the Max, alright, but just, I don't know, I think it should have ended there.

836
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:43,580
Just with max 300 and max unlimited, and the steps just start, you know, I guess there's

837
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:48,120
There's only so much they can do with the steps and before they run out of ideas.

838
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:51,140
It's interesting that you guys keep saying, there's only so much they can do, there's

839
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:53,780
only so much they can do, because I think they're done.

840
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:59,820
Because DDR Extreme has a credits mode on it, and in this credits mode it's very epilogue-ish

841
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:00,960
in the way it's presented.

842
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,940
It kind of goes through the history of DDR, like it shows, DDR first mix was then, and

843
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:08,440
DDR second mix was then, and shows little screenshots and stuff, and then they're pretty

844
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,660
much giving you the impression that that's it, we're done, no more DDR.

845
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:15,420
Although I don't think that's the case, I think DDR is going to come back, but it's

846
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:21,180
going to be a different, it's going to be different, like how BeatMania 2DX is different

847
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,180
than BeatMania.

848
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:26,380
And to further reinforce that, they have, in each mix that's released, there's a master

849
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:29,660
song list that includes all the songs that they're working on for other mixes that have

850
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:38,500
not been released yet, and DDR Extreme has the same track list as DDR Max USA 2, which

851
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,000
uh... pretty much it's just uh...

852
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,120
all that's left

853
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,520
on that song list is just the uh...

854
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,360
ultra mix and that's it

855
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:52,560
but obviously we know the european... I mean they're still developing for european

856
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:53,400
market

857
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,880
you know and they're also developing for our market so

858
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,960
I mean I'm sure you'll see more stuff it's just we'll only be in the U.S.

859
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,780
and we'll see once the stupid party collection comes out

860
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:08,980
There might be some more stuff on there, you never know.

861
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:12,580
Yeah, that's true, because there's still the party edition coming out.

862
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:16,620
Party collection, and you never know, it might be like preview for something.

863
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:19,620
Although, I seem to think that party, it's kind of weird that party collection is kind of

864
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:23,420
coming out after DDR has kind of already had its epilogue here.

865
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:24,740
So I don't know what

866
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:28,620
DDR party collection is going to be. I'm hoping that maybe there'll be some kind of hint

867
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:32,060
I wouldn't read too much into that Cred screen, because they're just talking about what came

868
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:34,980
out so far, it's kind of like a thank you to them.

869
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:38,180
I don't know about you guys, did you guys see the credits sequence at all, or did you

870
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:42,420
guys kind of, even from max period, even just the max period, thank you for playing the

871
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:45,540
way it, you know, it claps at the end and it's like a finale type thing, more of like

872
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,980
an encore kind of song.

873
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:48,980
I just kind of got the feeling there.

874
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:49,980
Then again, that song sucked.

875
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:55,300
Yeah, it did suck, I'll give you that, but, you know, it was probably rushed.

876
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:59,380
The whole thing is it comes back down to, like, you know, what they put on the stupid

877
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:04,540
header for Extreme. We're starting over. You don't start over if you're going to end it

878
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:09,740
right there. I mean, that's kind of retarded right there. I mean, obviously, they're going

879
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:14,220
to do something with it. They didn't say, this is the last one. This is, you know, it

880
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:19,460
ends here, you know, the final revolution or something like that, you know. They would

881
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:22,340
definitely advertise it like that if it was the last one. I don't think they're just going

882
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:28,700
to be like, hey, whatever. I mean, there's still plenty of stuff that they haven't even

883
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:33,540
tried yet. They haven't tried like doing songs with unlocks that have to do with the e-mall

884
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:38,580
cards and stuff like that and I'm sure there's a new machine coming. It's just a new type

885
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:46,540
of machine that they're still developing that's probably a little ways away. Here's what's

886
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:52,380
going to be interesting is that I'm very confident that we're going to see DDR Extreme in the

887
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:57,260
US, a home version of DDR Extreme. I'm very confident that we're going to have that. It's

888
01:01:57,260 --> 01:02:00,620
It's going to be interesting to see if the U.S. kind of treats it as a last mix or what

889
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:04,780
they're going to do because as far as I can tell, DDR in the U.S. is still mega popular.

890
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:10,940
I mean, I was listening to Understation Live on Friday night, the radio show that I started

891
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:14,620
on that's still on Live 365, if you want to catch it, I was listening to Understation

892
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:19,420
Live and the host there works for one of those discount stores, one of those big discount

893
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:24,180
stores, and they're getting like huge shipment of dance pads in now, which shows like, well,

894
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:26,780
maybe it's that, oh, the dance pads aren't selling, so they're having to be relegated

895
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:33,740
discount stores, but that more shows to me that DDR is everywhere. You know what I mean?

896
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:37,740
It's still growing in the US from what I see.

897
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:43,920
Just like always in Japanese games that are produced, directed, and created in Japan,

898
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:49,380
we always get them whatever the latest thing is in Japan. We get them either a few months

899
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:58,060
just a year or years behind them. Even though there were American machines three years ago

900
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:02,920
with the 1.5, it didn't still take off nearly as much as it's going to start with these

901
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:11,460
home versions. A lot of people out there see it as, oh, this is a good way to get exercise,

902
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:14,500
but they don't want to go up and make a fool of themselves on the American machines out

903
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:18,380
there in the arcades or some of the import machines. Now they're like, okay, I can buy

904
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:23,180
it and play it in my own home. So it's starting to get popular, people are starting to see

905
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:30,220
it. I think there is still a market for DDR in America, but I don't see there being much

906
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:33,300
more of a market for music games in general. In the next two years, I think we're going

907
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:39,180
to find out where music games are going, ending, or whether or not it's going to go much longer.

908
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:43,780
Because a lot of other companies are doing, Namco has a line of music games, they've got

909
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:48,300
Taiko no Tatsujin. There's a lot of other companies out there that are doing it.

910
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:55,740
Enix has been doing the Bust A Move series, even though that's pretty much done with.

911
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:59,820
Music games are going to die out very soon, so it's not surprising that the latest versions

912
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:07,300
of DDR are kind of just sucking. I think they're going to start, you can tell by where their

913
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:10,640
money is going with games. The big, big titles that come on me are putting out like this

914
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,280
new castlevania obviously there

915
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,240
taking their money away from their money

916
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,760
series and they're putting it towards something else the people are going to

917
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,200
might last longer

918
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,360
uh... i think i think you're wrong on one thing i don't think the music games

919
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,480
are dying i think they're just uh...

920
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,760
they're changing

921
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,740
as the systems get bigger and better i think these games are changing to i

922
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:35,720
think that's what we have like this new line of games can we have the karaoke

923
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:36,620
revolution

924
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:39,200
they say karaoke is going to be the next big music game

925
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:44,200
Because you've got American Idol, the game as well, which isn't really karaoke, it's more crap, but whatever.

926
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:49,200
The thing I was thinking of, though, is look at DDR itself as like an arcade machine.

927
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,200
It's running on hardware that's a good ten years old, you know?

928
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,200
That's true, it's running on...

929
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:58,200
Well, I don't know about ten years old, but it's 98, right?

930
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:01,200
Yeah, 98. It's like a good six years old right now.

931
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:06,200
It's due for an update. I mean, it's so old right now, they can't do anything else with this,

932
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:12,040
So they can't release another game on there because it will just be inferior.

933
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,640
They can't possibly do it.

934
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:17,320
That's why they're coming up with a new hardware system for it.

935
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,740
It makes sense that they're shifting their money away from it right now and they're kind

936
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:24,200
of hurrying through some of these things because maybe they're just trying new stuff right

937
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,760
now with the hardware.

938
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:31,000
They're trying to squeeze a few more mixes out of the hardware before they'd have to

939
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,040
create something brand new and now they're just like, well, we've done all we can with

940
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:45,040
What I would love to see to make DDR more interactive. Love to see them bring out another like a sub stream type mix.

941
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:51,580
But have a little more interactive. Where you got a newer version of BeatMania 2DX and a newer version of...

942
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:55,040
Or just whatever BeatMania mission they want to link to it. I would hope it would be 2DX.

943
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:59,040
With a DDR, a newer version of that. And let's say, you know, you play that...

944
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:03,040
Somebody is playing the 2DX, you don't HAVE to have them linked. But if you want to have them linked.

945
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:08,040
One person on T.D.X. will be playing the song, like DJing, so you've got a more interaction.

946
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,040
You've got a person who's DJing and a person who's dancing.

947
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:20,040
Then, depending on how good the person playing T.D.X., DJing, quote unquote, is doing, it makes the actual steps in the DDR version kind of different.

948
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:23,040
You know, the DDR side of the machine, it makes the steps a little different.

949
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:27,040
Like, they're playing really good, the song sounds good, the steps start to get a little harder.

950
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,040
You know, you see what I'm saying?

951
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:34,080
Or things like, I've heard Loki talk about this before, I think he said something like

952
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:39,800
Pump It Up has a thing where if you hit a certain step, it changes the way the steps

953
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,880
turn out in the end of the song.

954
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:45,520
So if you miss a certain step, it goes ahead and makes the song a little easier near the

955
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:46,520
end.

956
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,720
Whereas if you start doing really good, and you keep doing better and better, and you're

957
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:52,260
hitting all the steps, the song kind of morphs and it upgrades.

958
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:56,440
It becomes a harder song with a different type of ending.

959
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,560
These are good ideas.

960
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:01,500
I think they should go ahead and look into if they want to keep their DDR series alive,

961
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:05,620
because that, I believe, is going to be dying soon. Of course, Karaoke Revolution is going

962
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:10,260
to be a big thing. It's coming out. That is their new music game that's going to probably

963
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:14,900
be going on for a little while, but DDR just seems like it's dying.

964
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:19,500
Here's the problem with the 2DX DDR idea, I think, or whatever, you know, the Substream

965
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:24,620
2003 or whatever you're proposing. One arcade in the whole nation would have it, and that's

966
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:31,620
Not if they put in the effort to produce many of them and really advertise it and be innovative with them.

967
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:36,620
It would be so expensive. It would be so expensive. I don't think any...

968
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:41,620
The interesting thing about DDR is as expensive as it is, you can still find it at your local bowling game.

969
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:48,620
Well, okay, I'm not thinking in the interest of us Americans. I'm thinking of in the Japanese market.

970
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:53,060
is that I'm not going to be one of those people who sits and complains, why don't we get these

971
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:59,100
cool Japanese games in America? Because they're not made for us in America. The American companies

972
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:03,300
will want to bring them over when they think we're ready for them or if there is a market.

973
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:09,060
They're made in Japan for the Japanese market. Now, on top of that, I'm thinking for their

974
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:14,020
interest, they have a lot of TDR machines and a lot of GX machines in Japan. They could

975
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:19,980
just have a hardware upgrade, including a network adapter, that could link these machines.

976
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:25,640
Making new machines, of course, would be a hell of expensive, but the hardware upgrade

977
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:31,140
from 8th style to 9th style 2DX was a pretty big upgrade. It's all hard drive, it's all

978
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:37,820
a computer now, running an OS of, I believe, Windows XP. So they obviously can do it, and

979
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:44,460
They could keep it somehow a good economic decision.

980
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:47,420
I think it can be done.

981
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:56,300
I heard a few years ago the rumor was that Konami has been getting some bad flak or some

982
01:08:56,300 --> 01:09:00,900
bad results with their music series because of all the other companies bringing out other

983
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:03,940
music games.

984
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:08,760
If you have to admit, after Max 2 came out, I think all the rest of their music games

985
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,660
have just been like, ugh.

986
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:17,140
It may just be me, but nobody I know except the hardcore players are interested in Guitar

987
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:20,300
Freaks and Drum Mania anymore, yet the mixes keep coming out.

988
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:21,300
That's right.

989
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:24,300
And pop music keeps coming up.

990
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:28,820
Guitar Freaks has just gotten so stagnant since 5th.

991
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:33,240
When Keyboard Mania left, honestly, and it probably has nothing to do with the fact Keyboard

992
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:57,480
I love the game, but you have to look past the fact that you love the game and the idea

993
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:00,280
of the game and look at the quality of the music on it.

994
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:22,280
The quality of the music has gone down since 5th Mix. There were a lot of songs on there that I would play constantly. I pretty much always had something fresh to play. But when I go and I try to play Guitar Freak's 8th Mix I think we have, there's probably like 5 songs I'll play.

995
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:26,080
There are some good old songs that came, but I think I played them to death, and then as

996
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:29,520
far as the new songs is concerned, it's just like there's not very many good new songs.

997
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:35,560
I was just in Milpitas Golf Land not too long ago, I was there for Chub's Birthday Party

998
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:40,320
a couple weeks ago, and they have Guitar Freaks, it's either 9 or 10, I don't know what it

999
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,120
was, but I walked by it at one point and it was completely empty, and I had no interest

1000
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,240
in putting the dollar in and playing, even though I'd never even played it yet.

1001
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:50,240
Yeah, I haven't played it, so I think I tried it out, but still.

1002
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:57,240
I played the Guitar Freaks 10 I think, or 9, it was, yeah, it was 9.

1003
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,240
I don't even know if it's 9 or 10.

1004
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,240
10 just came out I think.

1005
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:08,240
It's 10 just coming out, so it's Guitar Freaks 9. I played that at Phantom of Khan once, and I was just like, eh. After that, didn't even care.

1006
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:17,240
Played it like maybe one or two times, and I was done. It's just like the new home versions. I play them for a day and I'm done with them.

1007
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:24,760
them. I wasted $50 on Max 2 or whatever. Max 2 was alright. It was kind of fun. I might

1008
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:32,240
pick it up later on. But Max 2 is a Japanese one. I played it for a day. Unlocked all three

1009
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:37,960
new songs, which was like whoop-a-dee-doo, and then I was done. I was done playing the

1010
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:42,240
game. I just didn't care no more, because I played the rest of these songs to death

1011
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:46,760
in the arcade?

1012
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:53,420
I will always like Drummania because I personally love playing.

1013
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:55,280
The percussion is just fun.

1014
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,280
Playing drums is fun.

1015
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:59,680
And Drummania will always be fun even if the quality of the songs starts to go down.

1016
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:00,680
It's still fun to play.

1017
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:04,120
But we are, in our local area, getting any new Drummania.

1018
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:09,220
And even when we have Drummania, it's broken a lot constantly.

1019
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:10,220
I can't speak for it.

1020
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:14,160
If I go down to M. Milpitas and get to play their Drummania 8th mix, then maybe I'll like

1021
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,160
it.

1022
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,840
I can't really speak for it right now.

1023
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:20,240
I hate to put you on the spot, Bradley, but I'm curious because I know you're a big fan

1024
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,880
of Guitar Freaks because you're always asking me to play the music from it.

1025
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,760
What do you think about this whole conversation?

1026
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:34,320
Eh, well, I haven't played 9th because I haven't been to Milpitas in like six months.

1027
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,320
I still like it.

1028
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:42,920
I haven't really heard the music from 9th because I've maybe listened to it once and

1029
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:47,480
I haven't listened to it since, so I can't really say anything about the quality, but

1030
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,800
I still enjoy it.

1031
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:53,000
That's all I can say at the moment.

1032
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,480
I have to say I am looking forward to Marmalade, Poparita Marmalade on, I think, its second

1033
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,480
to every extent.

1034
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:04,160
Yeah, if they're not doing any more DDR you would think all the artists that do the originals

1035
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:08,360
DDR will now you know go to some other games and make some good originals for

1036
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:12,560
that. I don't know of course I don't know what fucking game Soda could do so well

1037
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,240
I guess he'll go to 2DX or something even although you know it's

1038
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:24,000
debatable if 2DX has much life in it left as well so who knows who knows

1039
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:30,280
where all that's going okay it's hard to make a prediction we'll just have to see

1040
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,640
was there anything you saw in the chat room you want to comment on I know you

1041
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,440
We saw some stuff earlier that made you go on.

1042
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,440
It's a completely different topic.

1043
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,440
It'd be kind of weird to change topics.

1044
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:37,440
That's all right.

1045
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:41,640
But I want to say something real quick in case your neighbors are listening now.

1046
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:44,320
Are they really?

1047
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:49,960
Well, your neighbors walked by and they were saying, so, do you still do the show?

1048
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:50,960
And I said, yes.

1049
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,520
And they asked, what is it called and how did they get to it?

1050
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:57,960
And so I basically just said, Live 365, search for Orange Lounge and check it out because

1051
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,480
the page isn't updated really yet.

1052
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:02,520
It needs to be updated, the web page.

1053
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:03,520
It does need an update.

1054
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,520
He's funny though.

1055
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,520
He could listen to it.

1056
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:12,620
He's got broadband, so he could listen to it, and then he could respond to something

1057
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:15,920
you say in the chat room, and then come running downstairs, knock on your door, and go, hey,

1058
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:16,920
did you get that?

1059
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:17,920
Yeah.

1060
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:22,480
He could, theoretically, with the buffer, one of them could run downstairs, yell something

1061
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,480
in the microphone, then run upstairs and hear themselves.

1062
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,480
Oh, exactly.

1063
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:26,480
Exactly.

1064
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,340
With the buffer, they could hear themselves say it.

1065
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:30,720
Because I think we've, I've done that in one way or another.

1066
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:33,760
I don't remember what it was, but I remember yelling something in it and then going off

1067
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:34,760
to hear it somewhere else.

1068
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:38,200
I think it was when we were doing a remote broadcast for one of the tournaments, or something.

1069
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,200
That's great.

1070
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,640
Well, come say hello if you're listening.

1071
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:44,400
Yeah, if neighbors are listening, hi neighbors, sorry I forget your name.

1072
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,400
That's my test.

1073
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,120
I want to see if they're listening.

1074
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,120
Come downstairs and say something.

1075
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,440
I'm afraid they would have turned it off a long time ago.

1076
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:51,440
They probably got bored.

1077
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,440
This is so boring.

1078
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,640
A guitar freak's chat probably put him to sleep.

1079
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,960
All right, well let's wake everybody up with some, oh no, you wanted to respond to some

1080
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:58,960
comments in the chat room.

1081
01:14:58,960 --> 01:14:59,960
You want to take a topic shift.

1082
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:02,860
you want it, why don't we go to break and then we'll come back and you can do the other

1083
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:06,760
topic and then we'll do the cage match, because we need to get to tonight's cage match as

1084
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:21,400
well. Okay, we'll do that. We are...oh, you see that in the chatroom right now? Oh, hey,

1085
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:29,920
hello. There you go. I was wondering who the new people in the chatroom were. There you

1086
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:34,880
you go. You never know who the new people are. Okay, we'll be back after this break.

1087
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,960
We're going to play Jamie's. She's out tonight because she's sick, but she wanted to hear

1088
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:43,200
some Liar Liar from Guitar Freaks 4 with all that talk about Guitar Freaks. So here it

1089
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,200
is. Enjoy.

1090
01:15:44,200 --> 01:16:08,200
I can't watch the shots each time they move right by you, so they don't show

1091
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:28,200
Baby do you want the juice, baby do you want it

1092
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:40,200
Yeah, drop your bar, drop out the bar Yeah, drop your bar

1093
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,200
Yeah, drop your bar

1094
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,720
Yes, you can try to find the right system

1095
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:47,440
Now, there is a time when the streets are black and long

1096
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,760
Where there's words that you can't understand

1097
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:49,760
I'll just teach you today

1098
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,200
So there you are, I'm a pastor

1099
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,560
The mind can't be more than this

1100
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,040
It's close to starting on what it takes

1101
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,520
To deserve it's all we need

1102
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,520
Today, what we gotta do is build momentum

1103
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:58,880
If we hit it right, so it's the best

1104
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,520
And cry the way it's not counting the rhythm

1105
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,120
The marks that you took, we gotta get with it

1106
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:03,400
You made it seven, you're all mine

1107
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,280
Are you ready to do it now?

1108
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,080
You got the tango, so it's never ready

1109
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,080
To take that fall

1110
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:09,080
You ain't no cold wind from the fall

1111
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:19,080
Yeah, yeah, drop your bar, drop your bar, let me see that bar

1112
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:26,080
Yeah, yeah, there's still more rhythm, if you do the right tools and methods

1113
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:29,080
Ride the waves and come to the rhythm, the march to the rhythm, then just win it

1114
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:32,080
The pain is searing, almighty, but we can do it now, you must find your power

1115
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:36,080
Yeah, no race to take that for, and it's up to you to hit that door

1116
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,080
Oh

1117
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:46,080
Orange Lounge Radio. We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

1118
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:55,080
Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1119
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:59,080
You know what? That's funny because during the break the neighbors came downstairs.

1120
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:02,080
So they weren't listening. What do you know?

1121
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:07,080
So, um, we have to, uh, refrain from talking about how much Folsom sucks right now. No, I'm just kidding.

1122
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:10,080
Yeah, let's keep the language down to a minimum.

1123
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:13,080
We don't want people getting bad opinions of the people living next door.

1124
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:16,080
Alright. No, I'm kidding. I don't care.

1125
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:23,080
They already know we're crazy. They see the construction work out on the patio and they know we're not well, so...

1126
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:31,080
So, anyway, um, you wanted to talk about something else, right? You had a new topic, and then we're gonna get into this nice cage match.

1127
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:44,080
Okay, I'm not going to be talking about condoning any kind of illegal activity, except I'm just going to say there's some skepticism about mod chips for next generation systems.

1128
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:50,080
I'm speaking specifically of Xbox, Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube.

1129
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:54,080
I don't know anything about Xbox.

1130
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,080
I don't care to.

1131
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:56,080
I don't like Xbox.

1132
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,080
I'm not going to talk on that.

1133
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:02,080
GameCube, there's no current way to copy games, so there is no reason...

1134
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,080
Although, Matt thinks he heard something today.

1135
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,080
Matt, what's up, Matt?

1136
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:12,080
I read something today. I downloaded this off of Supernova.org, your wonderful BitTorrent site.

1137
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,080
Anyways, it is...

1138
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,080
And let me pull this up right here.

1139
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:21,080
Okay, it's a GameCube pack, is what I got.

1140
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,080
It's a bunch of different files.

1141
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:37,080
One of the files on there is called, it's PSUL 1.1. It's the GameCube code uploader which is basically, it runs ROM images off your PC on your GameCube.

1142
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:40,080
What kind of ROM images? Does it need systems?

1143
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,080
My M0GX, you know.

1144
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:43,080
Oh, GameCube ROM images?

1145
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:52,080
There's also a file in here where you can rip ROM straight from your GameCube using your network adapter.

1146
01:22:52,080 --> 01:23:08,080
So basically the way it works is you have to have a copy of Phantasy Star Online, a broadband adapter, a PC to GameCube cable basically, just a network cable from your Ethernet card of course.

1147
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:20,080
So basically you're just making a network connection from your GameCube to your PC and you just, and you run, you have to set up your computer on a certain IP, it's set to a certain IP so it can communicate with it.

1148
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:31,080
And you set up your IP and your Phantasy Star Online thing and you basically make a connection with Phantasy Star Online and you run the program and away you go.

1149
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:32,080
Oh my God.

1150
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,080
And there's no modding at all, you don't need to do any modding.

1151
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,080
Oh my God, Nintendo we love you.

1152
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:57,080
This has not been tested yet for us on our side, but they say it worked on there.

1153
01:23:57,080 --> 01:24:05,080
This just means we're this much closer to finally figuring out a way to back up your games for GameCube.

1154
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:10,080
Well, they actually have a program that supposedly does that, too. It's not really been tased.

1155
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:25,080
Well, I've heard, because I have a cousin who's going to remain nameless, who apparently is on the top always with all the backing up of games for L systems.

1156
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:29,600
and he told me a couple months ago that apparently there was no way to do it yet for GameCube,

1157
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:33,280
but hey, in a couple months they may have found something out, so I don't know.

1158
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:40,040
It's just really funny because I love watching how companies come out and say their system

1159
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:44,800
is so secure, is full-brew, and those are the companies that are the easiest to crack.

1160
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:50,120
Well, Nintendo's never really had a really good way to block piracy.

1161
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,120
Supposedly all...

1162
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,120
I mean...

1163
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,120
You know what's also weird?

1164
01:24:53,120 --> 01:25:01,120
I don't know if the GameCube is backwards compatible, but supposedly I read on one of the posts that Nintendo 64 ROM images work on there, too.

1165
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,120
It's possible.

1166
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:08,120
What are you talking about? Nintendo's always had one of the best ways to block piracy. They have cartridges. You can't copy a cartridge very easily.

1167
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:14,120
Actually, you can, but it's not easy. It's not as easy as putting in a PlayStation disc, click copy, done.

1168
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:15,120
Here's the thing, though.

1169
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,120
And having a lot of PSX.

1170
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:20,000
It's easy in ways, but not as easy in other ways.

1171
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,840
For the N64, my cousin had this thing called the V-Doctor.

1172
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:25,700
It was a pretty pricey drive.

1173
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:31,960
You stuck a CD-ROM drive underneath the N64, and it hooked up to it through this little

1174
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,340
serial cable thing that was on the N64.

1175
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:38,840
You hooked that into your hard drive, and what you would do, or to your computer, or

1176
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:41,600
what you could do, the reason why it had a CD-ROM drive is because you could either burn

1177
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:47,740
an image, a CD full of ROM images from N64 games, and then put it in this little V doctor

1178
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:51,960
thing, this drive, and it would play the games on your N64. You just had to have this other

1179
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:56,360
little cartridge, it was like a blank RAM cartridge that you would plug into your N64.

1180
01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:03,200
So, I mean, he had every freaking American and Japanese N64 game out, and even stuff

1181
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:06,360
that hadn't come out yet, when, you know, when I went over to his place, I was like,

1182
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:10,040
wow, how'd you do this? I mean, he was, he was doing it, he was pirating it. And even

1183
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:25,040
In Super Nintendo, there were ROM images and emulation, and it was an arcade memory card

1184
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:31,040
reader for a Nintendo 64. It's sold for, I believe, 99 cents.

1185
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:34,840
NFL Blitz, I think, is the game that uses it, because Roswell Golf Land has one. I've

1186
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:42,080
seen the Nintendo 64 memory card thing. Nobody uses that. Anyhow, my point was how it's easier

1187
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:45,840
in some ways is because you didn't have to mod any of the Nintendo systems. Whereas,

1188
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:49,840
like with Sonys, you have to get inside, void your warranty, solder here, solder there with

1189
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:54,040
this little chip you buy, and then possibly mess up your system, which I have done once

1190
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:57,040
out of like the 30 PlayStation systems that I've modded.

1191
01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:00,040
If I remember correctly, I think the Xbox, you don't actually have to...

1192
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,040
Supposedly, yeah.

1193
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,040
There's a software mod I think for that.

1194
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,040
There's some software.

1195
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:09,040
Which is not surprising because you look at all the flaws in Microsoft software, so hey.

1196
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:12,040
Okay, well you want to get back on the original topic.

1197
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:17,040
You want to talk about next-gen modding, which you have advised me against in the past.

1198
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,040
In the past.

1199
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:19,040
In the past.

1200
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:23,040
And I've always said, every time I brought this up in the past, like when PS2 first came

1201
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:26,080
This is the current subject now, PS2.

1202
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:30,040
In the past I said, it's not worth your time to buy a mod

1203
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:30,920
chip for PS2.

1204
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:33,680
And that, when I said in the past, I mean when it came out.

1205
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:36,920
Because they would come out with new games that would have

1206
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:40,000
mod detection, that would have mod chip detection, that would

1207
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,040
basically lock out the game so you couldn't play it.

1208
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:44,280
Or specifically, mostly that's going on for a lot of the

1209
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:45,760
online titles, which there isn't really

1210
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,000
many for PS2, anyway.

1211
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,440
Not right now.

1212
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:50,340
You know, there were ways of

1213
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:52,080
Final Fantasy XI just around the corner.

1214
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:52,660
Exactly.

1215
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:56,300
There were ways that they could combat it.

1216
01:27:56,300 --> 01:28:00,340
My cousin bought a year ago a mod chip for his PS2.

1217
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:03,780
And it's not as like newly fandangled and great

1218
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:04,980
as the newer ones out.

1219
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:07,140
But it has not given him a problem since.

1220
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:10,700
He's been able to back up every game that's come out since

1221
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:12,740
and play it fine.

1222
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:14,140
That's a year ago.

1223
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:16,340
So Sony has not been, you know, and what I always

1224
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:20,100
had said was that, you know, wait till PS2 starts to die out.

1225
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:21,820
I mean, they're still making games for it,

1226
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:26,460
but it's not too far off that we're going to hear of the PS3 or whatever the new system's

1227
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:30,580
going to be. And Loki says already is. I haven't been keeping up. But my point is that...

1228
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:36,540
I say once it hits $99, which is pretty soon, that's when everybody had a modded PlayStation.

1229
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:39,540
Exactly. That's when everybody's going to have a modded PlayStation 2. Except me, I

1230
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:42,420
have no reason for one. I honestly have no reason to get my PlayStation 2.

1231
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:47,780
Here's my point, though. There's a newer mod chip called the DMS3. I think you can go to

1232
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:49,580
It will bring it up.

1233
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:53,100
This mod chip, it's just as difficult to mod your Playstation 2 as it is with any of the

1234
01:28:53,100 --> 01:29:00,220
other PS2 mod chips, but this one has flash memory on it, and it has two BIOS flashes

1235
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:06,980
on it, and you can get updates, which you burn onto CDs from their site, that flash

1236
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:08,060
it to the newest BIOS.

1237
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:11,180
So say it, a new game comes out, and it detects the mod chip.

1238
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:15,860
You go to their newest site, they are on top of it, you download their little BIOS flash,

1239
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:20,340
burn it in a CD, put it in your PS2, there you go, you can play the game now. Also, because

1240
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:24,420
of that, there's all these other new features on the DMS3 where you can, when you're loading

1241
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:29,280
your PS2, you hold a button down, it sets it to turn off mod chip. So if you wanna play

1242
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:34,020
online games, like say you actually bought a real copy of Final Fantasy 11, and it's

1243
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:37,620
locking you out of their online server because you have a mod chip, you hold the button down,

1244
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:42,020
disables your mod chip, now you can play online. This new DMS3 mod chip is the one to get,

1245
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:46,620
I'm telling you, it's time you can mod your freaking PS2s.

1246
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:50,580
I don't want people going out there saying that it's worthless, because it is, you can

1247
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:51,580
do it now.

1248
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:55,260
I mean, I don't, I mean, it's just, like I always say at the beginning.

1249
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:56,540
There may not be a reason to do it.

1250
01:29:56,540 --> 01:29:57,540
For some people, there's no reason.

1251
01:29:57,540 --> 01:29:58,540
For me, there's no reason.

1252
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:00,100
There is nothing left I want to play on PS2.

1253
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:01,100
Nothing.

1254
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,460
Well, for me, I think all that I have is Japanese.

1255
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:05,340
Everything I want to play is Japanese, anyway.

1256
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:10,100
And with, now technically with a mod chip, I can play the Japanese games, but there's

1257
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:11,100
just not that many.

1258
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:21,100
Okay, your point is taken, you know, but there's some of us untrustworthy people out there who want to play our other games, you know, and pictures of our games.

1259
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:26,100
You tell me how to mod my GameCube, I'm on it, because I play my GameCube more than anything else.

1260
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:31,100
I don't think you're ever going to need to mod your GameCube, eventually there's going to be a way around it, like Loki just said, so.

1261
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:32,100
Exactly.

1262
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:34,100
There's always going to be a way around it.

1263
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:38,380
this is what they all say when ps3 comes out to be online. You're gonna download your games

1264
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:41,780
online everything's gonna be online. You're not gonna be able to mod this shit anymore.

1265
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:47,480
Never gonna happen. Why say that, lovey? Cause people like to go out to a store and go buy

1266
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:51,900
stuff and take it home. It's a satisfaction having the case in your hand, the instruction

1267
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:55,820
mails and shit. Yeah, you might be able to buy stuff online. That's why online video

1268
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:59,900
like, you know, rental services and stuff, or online streaming video hasn't taken off

1269
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:05,000
in the first place because no one cares because people are, you know, stuck in the past and

1270
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,360
they don't want to go, you know, do all this brand new downloading shit. Now that, it'll

1271
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:16,320
be a good, you know, supplement to games but it's never going to replace games. Well, what

1272
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:20,560
about like something like iTunes which is, you know, the way you can download music online

1273
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:23,840
and it's, you know, they've sold what, 10 million songs today. It's the most successful

1274
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:29,040
online one. True, it's not nearly as big as going into the store and buying things but

1275
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:35,040
For those people that prefer to buy their things online, they have a pretty viable option, and it's somewhat successful.

1276
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:42,040
For people who were talking, I think Baka is saying, was it DMS3 or DMX? It's DMS3, but at DMS3.com, you can find out about it.

1277
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:49,040
Yeah, but the thing is, though, is I don't like not buy a game because I only like a portion of the game.

1278
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:56,040
See, now with CDs, I may only like one song, so I'm only going to buy that one song, and if the only way I can buy that song is online,

1279
01:31:56,040 --> 01:32:00,540
then yeah, I'm going to go ahead and do that, because there might not be a single for that.

1280
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:06,340
In my case, I don't buy music because it's too damn expensive and the artists mostly suck.

1281
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:11,840
If I want to discover new music, I'm going to go about it the illegal way and download it for free.

1282
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:15,840
Or, I'm going to go listen to those independent artists that don't get any coverage,

1283
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:20,940
and those normally end up being better than the most mainstream artists anyways.

1284
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:28,540
So why should I spend money and pay for your product when it stinks? When it's lower quality

1285
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:33,500
than something I can get for free? Why should I pay for something that's not top quality

1286
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:37,260
when I can get top quality for free? That's what I want to know. And until you find a

1287
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:45,820
viable way to actually physically stop all piracy on the internet, which as much as the

1288
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:54,860
The RIA and MPAA want to try, they're never ever going to get close enough to stop it.

1289
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:59,580
They're really wasting too much money on that, but anyways, there's no reason for me to buy

1290
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:00,580
it.

1291
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:03,700
Just like iTunes, I'm not interested in it at all, because you know what?

1292
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:07,300
I can get it for free, so why am I going to pay a dollar a song?

1293
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:11,740
Sure, you know, for people that want to go ahead and do the legal route, that's cool,

1294
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:12,780
but I just don't really feel like it.

1295
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:16,380
Some people are afraid of the marketing monsters.

1296
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:17,060
Well, yeah.

1297
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:19,340
Oh, the big bad RIA is going to track us down.

1298
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:20,620
He goes, eh, whatever.

1299
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:22,460
You know, I don't listen to a lot of music

1300
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:23,260
in the first place.

1301
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:24,780
Most of the music I listen to is just

1302
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:27,660
the Bimani stuff and homemade remixes.

1303
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:30,060
I don't listen to a lot of mainstream stuff.

1304
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:32,500
I was hoping to save the iTunes topic for Vanilla Sky

1305
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,420
Tomorrow Night, but whatever.

1306
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:35,460
That's fine.

1307
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:37,660
On top of mainstream stuff, real quick.

1308
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:39,340
OK.

1309
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:40,140
Never mind.

1310
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:41,340
You might want to talk about this later.

1311
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:43,860
I just want to say real quick, I used iTunes this week.

1312
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:45,780
I downloaded it because it's new for Windows.

1313
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:47,860
And I bought two songs off it, just because I want to try it,

1314
01:33:47,860 --> 01:33:48,900
see if it was good.

1315
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:50,380
And I'll tell you what.

1316
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:54,980
If iTunes had come out right after Napster went down,

1317
01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:57,460
there would not be the piracy on the internet, to the extent

1318
01:33:57,460 --> 01:33:58,520
of which it is right now.

1319
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:00,180
There would still be people like Loki who would still

1320
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:02,700
have their ways of pirating things, IRC, da, da, da, da.

1321
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:04,380
It would not be as big as it was now.

1322
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:07,740
People would be using iTunes because it's really well done.

1323
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:10,060
And I just want to say the reason why I've used iTunes

1324
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:14,540
reason why I've downloaded and paid for songs on iTunes is A. To some extent I believe in

1325
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:18,220
supporting the artist for a song I really really like and the songs I downloaded I really

1326
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:24,320
really like and B. Because when I try to find these songs on file share I get shit copies

1327
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:30,500
every time I get lousy volume I get just cut things and you know what it is just worth

1328
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:36,740
the god damn dollar to just get a perfect quality song the first time. The end. That's

1329
01:34:36,740 --> 01:35:05,740
I'm sorry, what I was going to say is that people who will probably go, oh no, piracy would be where it is now, even if they did do it. It may have gotten to the point eventually, but not as quickly, because I believe that once you put an obstacle in the way of somebody, and they want to overcome it, they will.

1330
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:10,300
they will, and they'll find a way to overcome it. You put trials in front of somebody who

1331
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:15,300
wants to pass these, to get over these obstacles, it's just going to make them want to get there

1332
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:20,780
faster. They're going to find their way over it. So, I think that's a good point. I mean,

1333
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:25,420
if they had put it up, they wouldn't be having as much problems right now with what they've

1334
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:29,260
been doing. But they did. End of story. RIA did not act

1335
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:34,300
fast enough, which is why the MPAA is trying so hard right now with the movies thing. They're

1336
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:38,540
trying to get all these movie services up and going, and although Loki's right, there's

1337
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:43,780
not that many people that really want to watch movies online. They're trying.

1338
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:49,460
Movies is a thing that will never, ever be done like that. I mean, until every freaking

1339
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:53,140
house gets their own movie theater, because people want to go see stuff on the big screen

1340
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:58,520
with nice theater systems, but games, home console games, it's a possibility that we

1341
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:01,900
could go completely online and have to download everything, because you're not changing the

1342
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:05,020
experience, except for the people who want to go...

1343
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:09,140
You are changing experience, because now not only do I have to go buy a game system that's

1344
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:12,740
fucking expensive when it comes out because they have all these new features, now I have

1345
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:17,220
to buy a membership online, now I have to buy cable internet, where I might not have

1346
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:20,900
it, you know, because it's not going to work on dial-up. Oh, but if I do have dial-up,

1347
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:25,300
it's going to take four goddamn years to download the goddamn game, and what if there's a disconnection

1348
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:29,140
on, you know, what if my cable goes out or something? There goes my game, I don't have

1349
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:33,700
game store to my hard drive because that crashes, too. It's just too much stuff. You're going

1350
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:38,220
to have a game. How are they going to rent product then out at the stores? The rental

1351
01:36:38,220 --> 01:36:43,940
businesses for games are going to go out because it's all online supposedly, but the MPAA would

1352
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:49,740
not care. They would love to see that happen. The MPAA would care because people like to

1353
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:54,660
rent movies. They don't like to buy movies, okay? Because renting a movie costs $5. You

1354
01:36:54,660 --> 01:37:00,260
see it once, you're done. Instead of investing that money and watching that movie and having

1355
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:05,820
it at home, like I have tons of movies I buy and don't watch, it's just stupid. But if

1356
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:10,980
they could be in control of the movie renting and not Blockbuster, that's capitalism.

1357
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:17,180
See, like I said, the movie renting and movie business will not change completely. It won't

1358
01:37:17,180 --> 01:37:21,660
go completely online. Regardless of whether people want to buy or rent or whatever, people

1359
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:24,540
still want to see movies on the big screen, and if they want to rent them, they'll go

1360
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:29,260
to the movie rental places and rent them. Those won't go out of business. Maybe renting

1361
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:35,260
video games will go, but the fact is that they're obviously not going to implement or

1362
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:41,940
try to implement something like that until every Internet connection in America is broadband,

1363
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:46,060
until it's standard to get broadband and extremely cost efficient.

1364
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:50,900
The only way it will ever be like that is when broadband becomes as common as electricity.

1365
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:52,140
That's the only way.

1366
01:37:52,140 --> 01:37:56,620
Which is something that they've talked about in the last five years ago.

1367
01:37:56,620 --> 01:38:00,300
There was a thing called, I can't remember, I used to have the website for it, but they

1368
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:05,100
were basically saying that they could get speeds of fiber optic speed, how fast fiber

1369
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:10,420
optic networks go, that kind of speed from your electrical outlet.

1370
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:14,140
They could do this thing where they could make the, they take the digital signal from

1371
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:18,540
wherever the server is, they convert it to analog, and they put it in I think a really,

1372
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:22,540
really low frequency, just kind of like how DSL is, and they run it through the power

1373
01:38:22,540 --> 01:38:28,820
lines, and it goes at like fiber optic speeds, and they just have to install these, they

1374
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:33,660
have to build these up, these like switching boxes in cities, in certain areas, because

1375
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:39,960
there's only so much, there's a signal degradation that happens, you know. And so, that was like

1376
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:42,900
five years ago, and they said they were still working on it, and they want it, but basically

1377
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:47,940
that kind of idea makes you wonder, you know, in the near future, in like the next ten years,

1378
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:52,400
We could see where you plug in your appliance, your computer, to the wall, and it's got Internet

1379
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:53,400
connection instantly.

1380
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:56,660
They talk about fridges with Internet connection and all this crazy stuff.

1381
01:38:56,660 --> 01:38:58,120
They talk about that on the same page.

1382
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:01,500
They said something about how, like, what if your toaster was plugged in?

1383
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:03,640
I don't want my toaster being plugged in, Internet, obviously.

1384
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:06,820
I don't want fricking, like, advertisements burning onto my toast.

1385
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:10,260
My toaster comes up and it's got an Apple logo on it.

1386
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:13,420
I can see it writing in your journal, today kind of sucked.

1387
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:17,420
A hacker broke into my toaster today and started burning my bread.

1388
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:20,420
Exactly. See, I don't want that kind of thing.

1389
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:23,420
All right. I just want to bring up a point from the camera real fast.

1390
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:24,420
My blender wouldn't stop.

1391
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:26,420
John Fields makes a pretty good point. He says,

1392
01:39:26,420 --> 01:39:34,420
All I have to say, if the MPAA had control of renting, unfair monopoly that the government would thus force Blockbuster to take over again.

1393
01:39:34,420 --> 01:39:40,420
So he's suggesting that the MPAA did have control of all of this stuff, the unfair monopoly, like what Microsoft's being subjected to right now.

1394
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:43,420
Good point. There's not much I can respond to that. Good point.

1395
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:44,420
Oh, well.

1396
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:48,420
It's fun to just say, you know, who knows.

1397
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:53,640
Speaking from the perspective of talking to the store owners all the time, they are not

1398
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:58,700
smart enough to do this all online and they will fight this to the death.

1399
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:02,540
You have to understand, most of the people that you talk to out there, I mean, because

1400
01:40:02,540 --> 01:40:08,060
we have our exposure with our friends who are all connected to here and all wired individuals,

1401
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:11,580
but your average Joe doesn't know jack about computers, won't touch it because they act

1402
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:12,580
like it's the devil.

1403
01:40:12,580 --> 01:40:13,580
My father.

1404
01:40:13,580 --> 01:40:37,760
other.

1405
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,760
Here's proof.

1406
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:50,020
the 80s and late 70s when arcade games were coming out. People who played arcade games

1407
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:59,020
were usually a lot older. Video game consoles started coming out and with the newer generations

1408
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:05,920
kids started playing at younger ages. My friend's brother could beat Chrono Trigger and get every

1409
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:13,320
freaking ending at the age of five, next generation comes along, they all are online at age three.

1410
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:18,280
I have a friend whose son used to play games online at age three, and I'm not shitting

1411
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:21,800
you. Pretty soon, everybody is going to be born with a freaking mouse in their hand.

1412
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:22,800
I mean, it's just the way it is.

1413
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:26,760
I just want to make a quick plug. On Vanilla Sky tomorrow night, we're going to bring up

1414
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:32,040
an article where they talk about these young kids, and they're going to make these young

1415
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:36,840
kids play games that we played when we were young kids. Just wait to hear what they have

1416
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:43,840
to say. You are going to feel so old tomorrow night. 7 o'clock, vanilla Skype.

1417
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:51,260
I love that idea. I don't understand. The characters don't talk to you, like vocally.

1418
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:58,260
So which block am I? Ew, what is this little blocky thing? Why is that ostrich attacking

1419
01:41:58,260 --> 01:42:27,980
There will always be a way.

1420
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:31,060
who are out there saying, no, it's worthless.

1421
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:34,420
No, there will always be a way to remember that.

1422
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:36,380
OK, if you'd like to comment on any of that,

1423
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:40,180
head on over to our chat room, www.calibomani.com,

1424
01:42:40,180 --> 01:42:43,540
click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat.

1425
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:45,420
And join in our chat room.

1426
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:47,240
And by the way, being in our chat room

1427
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:49,420
is the only way that you can participate in tonight's

1428
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:52,740
one and only cage match.

1429
01:42:52,740 --> 01:42:54,140
Yes, the Orange Lounge cage match

1430
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:56,580
is where we're going to play three songs back to back,

1431
01:42:56,580 --> 01:43:01,580
One picked by me, one picked by DarkSapra, even though she's not here, she submitted her vote online to me.

1432
01:43:01,580 --> 01:43:03,580
And one picked by Loki.

1433
01:43:03,580 --> 01:43:05,580
And you can vote for one of those three songs.

1434
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:09,580
The winner goes into musical rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1435
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:13,580
So you, the chatroom, have the power to decide which song will be played all week.

1436
01:43:13,580 --> 01:43:17,580
We start off with last week's winner, which is a song brought to us by Loki.

1437
01:43:17,580 --> 01:43:20,580
And since it was last week's winner, we're only going to hear a clip of it.

1438
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:25,580
The song is P8107, and it's a remix of Paranoia by...

1439
01:43:25,580 --> 01:43:27,980
Ono Ken. Thank you, Ono Ken.

1440
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:32,300
So here it is. This is a clip because it was last week's winner. You only get to hear a little bit of it.

1441
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:36,620
Song number one tonight, last week's winner, P8107.

1442
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:43,620
here we go

1443
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:08,620
Oh

1444
01:44:36,620 --> 01:45:06,440
Alright, that's song number one for tonight.

1445
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:09,800
It's P8107 by OnoKen.

1446
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:12,840
Song number two tonight is my pick, and you get to hear the whole thing because it's a

1447
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:14,000
new song.

1448
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:18,440
I was on the internet not too long ago just downloading a bunch of remixes by Above & Beyond

1449
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:20,560
because I fucking love them, they're great.

1450
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:23,280
And so I wanted to get as many remixes by them as I could, and this is one of the ones

1451
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:24,280
I got.

1452
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:28,160
This is an artist called Ministry of Sound, and the song is Far From In Love, and it's

1453
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:29,800
the Above & Beyond mix.

1454
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:30,800
Enjoy.

1455
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:37,800
number two tonight that you can vote for in the cage match.

1456
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:35,800
Yeah.

1457
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:40,800
Yeah.

1458
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:45,800
Yeah.

1459
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:50,800
Yeah.

1460
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:55,800
Yeah.

1461
01:46:55,800 --> 01:47:12,800
I can see behind your eyes, but you're afraid of who you are.

1462
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:17,800
All these silence now between us, I'm amazed.

1463
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:22,800
From this far, far from enough

1464
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:29,800
Far from enough

1465
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:36,800
Like a fire burning in its animal

1466
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:39,800
This is where it ends

1467
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:42,800
In the ashes we are dying

1468
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:46,300
I'm a stranger, only friends

1469
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:49,300
I'm running out

1470
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:53,300
I'm running out

1471
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:56,300
I'm running out

1472
01:47:56,300 --> 01:48:00,300
You know I won't know how to be in smoke

1473
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:02,300
I'm running out

1474
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:05,300
I'm running out

1475
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:10,300
I'm running out

1476
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:18,300
From all the love I've had with you

1477
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:25,300
Now I've missed your touch

1478
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:45,300
I've been living everywhere now just looking back

1479
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:50,300
And if you try

1480
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:59,300
I'm trying to show the love that was built up this year

1481
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:05,300
Yeah, she's so great

1482
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:59,180
Alright, that was, I'm being corrected on the artist, sorry guys.

1483
01:49:59,180 --> 01:50:04,820
Was actually above and beyond themselves doing that song even better in my opinion far from and love is the song and if you're curious

1484
01:50:04,820 --> 01:50:08,960
About that edit it is from the CD trans nation 2003 which isn't in port by the way

1485
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:12,100
Let's go around the room and see what people thought of that star off with Loki

1486
01:50:13,940 --> 01:50:15,940
It's pretty cool. I liked it

1487
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:18,660
This is about Beyond

1488
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:20,660
So, I can't go wrong now.

1489
01:50:48,660 --> 01:50:53,660
p0k3smot42o i wasnt listening to it

1490
01:51:18,660 --> 01:51:24,660
I don't know if I can beat many SGX files on this simulator, so sorry I didn't hear it.

1491
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:30,660
You didn't hear any of it at all? You were standing right there!

1492
01:51:30,660 --> 01:51:35,660
Is this Loki's pick, or whose? Yours? I'm gonna give it a 1.

1493
01:51:35,660 --> 01:51:37,660
Gonna help.

1494
01:51:37,660 --> 01:51:41,660
Alright, that was song number 2 above and beyond, far from 11.

1495
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:45,660
Here is... what? We're doing what again?

1496
01:51:45,660 --> 01:51:51,820
Oh, I thought the show was fucking up all right song number three is Jamie's pick

1497
01:51:51,820 --> 01:51:54,420
She sends this along even though she can't be here

1498
01:51:54,420 --> 01:51:58,580
She wants you all to hear it and hope that it'll win tonight's cage match here. It is I

1499
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:05,320
Listen to this song before the show a little bit. It's pretty good. It's an a vex song you guys know a vex 2dx

1500
01:52:05,620 --> 01:52:07,620
Licenses a lot of tracks from them

1501
01:52:08,900 --> 01:52:10,060
Getting mic switch on me

1502
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:15,580
Okay, the song is called Ways of Love and the artist is CyberX featuring Jodie

1503
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:20,060
Watley and it's from an album called CyberX so give this a try. If you like

1504
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:25,300
Avex tracks you just might like this. This is Jamie's pick tonight, CyberX

1505
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:27,300
featuring Jody Watley with Waves.

1506
01:52:55,300 --> 01:53:03,300
And we carried on that way

1507
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:07,300
Through the power of emotion

1508
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:11,300
If you're running once again

1509
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:16,300
See a hundred million lights

1510
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:20,300
Shining on you from above now

1511
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:25,300
Carrying your heart tonight

1512
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:41,300
I will see you again

1513
01:53:41,300 --> 01:53:45,300
Feeling waves of love

1514
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:48,300
Messages we send

1515
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:52,300
Feel the waves of love

1516
01:53:52,300 --> 01:53:55,300
There's a new horizon

1517
01:53:55,300 --> 01:53:58,300
With the rising sun

1518
01:53:58,300 --> 01:54:02,300
We can reach the heavens

1519
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:07,300
On the waves of love

1520
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:09,300
The waves of love

1521
01:54:37,300 --> 01:54:39,400
No one is but you

1522
01:54:39,400 --> 01:55:07,400
No one is around

1523
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:22,400
We're beyond the X-Men scene There's a phase of knowing tomorrow

1524
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:32,400
And the way ahead is clear With your flight and this control

1525
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:35,900
You can open up your feelings

1526
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:39,900
And bear your heart and soul

1527
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:42,900
I will see you again

1528
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:46,900
Feel the waves of love

1529
01:55:46,900 --> 01:55:49,900
Rest the tears we shed

1530
01:55:49,900 --> 01:55:53,400
Feel the waves of love

1531
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:56,900
There's a new horizon

1532
01:55:56,900 --> 01:56:00,400
This projection

1533
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:03,400
We can reach the heavens

1534
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:09,400
On the waves of love

1535
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:12,400
The waves of love

1536
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:15,400
I can feel your hands

1537
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:19,400
Feel the waves of love

1538
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:22,400
Message every step

1539
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:26,400
Feel the waves of love

1540
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:29,400
There's a new horizon

1541
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:41,400
When the light is on, we can reach the heavens on the waves of love.

1542
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:46,400
dukeofthebump

1543
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:17,040
drag for me towards the end, but I do typically like most Avex tracks, so I'll be nice and

1544
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:19,480
give it a seven and a half.

1545
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:24,960
The trance song is supposed to sound the same for like seven minutes, different. I can't

1546
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:27,840
explain it, but it's different. Just go with it, okay?

1547
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:32,840
Jamie sends her vote online and she says, of course, her song gets a ten for being Exciting

1548
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:11,880
I've said before to other people I don't really like trance songs unless it's the Kiriyama

1549
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:15,640
Oka, so I'm giving it a 5.

1550
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:16,640
You're mean.

1551
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:20,920
I'm not trying to be mean, just trance can't really be interesting unless it's the Kiriyama

1552
01:58:20,920 --> 01:58:21,920
Oka.

1553
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:22,920
Alright, alright.

1554
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:24,920

01:59:59,740 --> 02:00:01,740
All right.

1578
02:00:01,740 --> 02:00:06,540
So, back to the show while we tally up those votes for CAGEMATCH as they come in.

1579
02:00:06,540 --> 02:00:12,340
Loki, tell us about this other project you've kind of been working on lately, you're working

1580
02:00:12,340 --> 02:00:15,580
on it now, you've been working on it for a little while, what is, what's up with this?

1581
02:00:15,580 --> 02:00:21,740
You're kind of taking StepMania modification to the extreme from what I see, no pun intended.

1582
02:00:21,740 --> 02:00:29,680
Well, I'm just, right now, because no one can see this out there in, you know, Radioland,

1583
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:31,500
i'm making a new banner

1584
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:32,780
for uh...

1585
02:00:32,780 --> 02:00:34,260
dancehouse revolution

1586
02:00:34,260 --> 02:00:36,760
it's uh... basically here's what i've been doing

1587
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:41,180
i've been trying to pitch an idea to keith at golf land because

1588
02:00:41,180 --> 02:00:44,420
i've seen it done before where you

1589
02:00:44,420 --> 02:00:47,060
basically wire a uh...

1590
02:00:47,060 --> 02:00:47,980
stepmania

1591
02:00:47,980 --> 02:00:51,040
pc you know to uh... ddr machine

1592
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:55,020
and run stepmania on there, well stepmania is meant to run as an arcade machine itself

1593
02:00:55,020 --> 02:00:55,820
because

1594
02:00:55,820 --> 02:00:59,380
it's got options for credits and all that stuff so

1595
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:03,660
obviously that's what i'm doing here in in-house uh... with

1596
02:01:03,660 --> 02:01:06,900
you know cabinets being built but i thought you know why not do that in

1597
02:01:06,900 --> 02:01:08,280
arcade too

1598
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:12,260
so i've been basically looking into licensing rights and what it would cost

1599
02:01:12,260 --> 02:01:13,320
you know because

1600
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:16,440
obviously i'm not going to ask konami for permission because no

1601
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:19,200
they're never going to say yes so we're doing it anyways

1602
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:20,900
uh... but uh...

1603
02:01:20,900 --> 02:01:23,160
i've been looking into like if you know music

1604
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:26,400
you know artists or something was to come after me how

1605
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:31,760
you know, what actual licensing rights we would need. So, I checked into it. Basically,

1606
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:37,880
a stamp-mini based game could be considered a jukebox because it's just, you know, music

1607
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:43,000
being played. And so, it would fall under jukebox license rights, I think. I don't know.

1608
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:48,200
It's a gray area but it only cost $364 a year to actually legally license it. But if we

1609
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:55,320
did all like Konami original stuff and just basically, it's going to be, you know, I want

1610
02:01:55,320 --> 02:02:01,740
them to put a sim in the arcade and charge money for people to play it and basically

1611
02:02:01,740 --> 02:02:08,960
skin it like an official mix and be so convincing that any idiot out there that doesn't know

1612
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:11,380
much about the sim world would think it's an official.

1613
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:16,380
So that's what I'm going to do and right now I'm making a banner for Dance Dance Revolution

1614
02:02:16,380 --> 02:02:17,380
EX2.

1615
02:02:17,380 --> 02:02:19,580
That's what I've got right now.

1616
02:02:19,580 --> 02:02:21,300
What the hell are you doing?

1617
02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:23,300
You fucking idiot.

1618
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:42,500
It looks like it's kind of squashed vertically, I have to fix that, but yeah, that's what

1619
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:45,940
I was doing it pretty much if you know Keith says no what you probably will

1620
02:02:45,940 --> 02:02:48,460
because you know he has to ask management and I'm sure they're gonna be

1621
02:02:48,460 --> 02:02:52,740
like no you know if he was this was back at Scandia before he left he would

1622
02:02:52,740 --> 02:02:57,940
definitely done it but right now the feasibility is probably not gonna it's

1623
02:02:57,940 --> 02:03:02,380
not gonna happen there but this is just for my own you know machine pretty much

1624
02:03:02,380 --> 02:03:06,620
because if you think about it I could probably make a better mix in Konami Ken

1625
02:03:06,620 --> 02:03:11,980
so why not give it a chance and I I posed the option to them I'm like look

1626
02:03:11,980 --> 02:03:16,540
get past the initial investment of buying the actual pc which would pay for itself pretty

1627
02:03:16,540 --> 02:03:21,780
quickly since the ddr machines make a ton of money. um, you'd have free upgrades for

1628
02:03:21,780 --> 02:03:28,720
life on that damn thing so software upgrades would be easy but you know...whatever. so

1629
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:33,800
that's what I've been doing on there. so you think you're gonna get away with it? I mean

1630
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:38,180
I realize that you're saying that it's probably not gonna make it. but lets say it does make

1631
02:03:38,180 --> 02:03:41,680
it somehow or you buy an arcade. you win the lotter you buy an arcade or you put this machine

1632
02:03:41,680 --> 02:03:46,280
in it, you think you'll make it? Well, yeah, they're really the only people that could

1633
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:49,620
rain out of my parade, if that were to ever happen, would be the people that play the

1634
02:03:49,620 --> 02:03:54,400
game itself religiously because they're like, oh, oh my God, you know, that's not an official

1635
02:03:54,400 --> 02:04:01,720
Konami game, that's a bootleg. You're running on a sim. But they're looking past, you know,

1636
02:04:01,720 --> 02:04:05,000
what it actually is and not just playing it for what it's supposed to be, which is just

1637
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:10,380
a game, you know. And if Konami's going to stop making arcade games, you know, the U.S.

1638
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:15,840
isn't making arcade games for DDR and all these games are getting stagnant in arcades,

1639
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:20,040
people are going to go one of two routes. They're either going to spend a $1500 to buy

1640
02:04:20,040 --> 02:04:25,500
some hacked bootleg which is looking like shit or they're going to run software like

1641
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:31,700
this that you can emulate, you know, pretty much, you know, emulate DDR perfectly and

1642
02:04:31,700 --> 02:04:36,340
have, you know, new features added to it that aren't seen in any of the games. Plus, you

1643
02:04:36,340 --> 02:04:42,420
you know, your collection of musics, you know, limitless, so why not for free? I mean, you're

1644
02:04:42,420 --> 02:04:47,980
talking about investing maybe, I figured, I was looking at computers and stuff, I could

1645
02:04:47,980 --> 02:04:53,740
probably run this on a $400 PC. So that's an initial investment, $400 versus $1500 for

1646
02:04:53,740 --> 02:04:59,940
a shitty bootleg that just has old music anyways. And we're talking like full unlocks here,

1647
02:05:29,940 --> 02:05:38,580
I don't know. I think unless people made it a real big deal about it, it's not like I'm

1648
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:46,240
selling it. It's a one arcade exclusive thing. I don't see what the big deal would be. But

1649
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:55,860
we should have never invited him over. Brad is being a total cam whore right now. What

1650
02:05:55,860 --> 02:06:02,220
can you do? I'm going to do the cage match winner in a minute, but we have one. There's

1651
02:06:02,220 --> 02:06:05,940
currently a tie in the cage match and I'm waiting on one more vote to see if it breaks

1652
02:06:05,940 --> 02:06:10,100
the tie because one of our new listeners is trying to send a vote along right now. I want

1653
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:15,620
to talk about DDRXBox for a minute. God, Brad, you're such an idiot. I want to talk about

1654
02:06:15,620 --> 02:06:19,340
DDRXBox for a minute because there was some news this week about DDRXBox and that is that

1655
02:06:19,340 --> 02:06:27,180
it's gone gold. No, it's not sold a certain amount of copies, but it's finished. It's

1656
02:06:27,180 --> 02:06:31,300
in the can, it's done, and it's going to be out November 18th. It's kind of interesting,

1657
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:36,060
not a lot of knowledge about DDRXBox right now when it comes to songs. We know that there's

1658
02:06:36,060 --> 02:06:41,940
going to be a remix of Absolut in it. We know that it has shiny disco balls in it. The Quickening,

1659
02:06:41,940 --> 02:06:46,300
Castles in the Sky, Mad Blast, I think was another one. Is that what it's called, the

1660
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:20,240
is not quite as big as it is for a typical Playstation release, I don't know if people

1661
02:07:20,240 --> 02:07:23,660
are just scared because it's different or whatever, or maybe just because the marketing

1662
02:07:23,660 --> 02:07:27,560
hasn't kicked in yet, but I don't know, there just doesn't seem to be a lot of excitement

1663
02:07:27,560 --> 02:07:28,560
about it.

1664
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:33,880
I just, wouldn't it be interesting if this did well that maybe Konami of Hawaii were

1665
02:07:33,880 --> 02:07:38,740
to put together some new arcade release with their brand new interface they've done and

1666
02:07:38,740 --> 02:07:42,860
their more competitive DDR-ness they have in there and all that stuff?

1667
02:07:42,860 --> 02:07:48,460
Do you have something coherent you want to add to this conversation?

1668
02:07:48,460 --> 02:07:52,260
That's how I said Merry Christmas in Hawaiian.

1669
02:07:52,260 --> 02:07:57,340
Mecha Meleki Maka, something like that.

1670
02:07:57,340 --> 02:08:00,260
Would you fucking talk about something worthwhile, Rob?

1671
02:08:00,260 --> 02:08:02,500
Wait, you don't think Xbox is worthwhile?

1672
02:08:02,500 --> 02:08:03,500
No.

1673
02:08:03,500 --> 02:08:04,500
Why not?

1674
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:05,500
Xbox.

1675
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:06,500
Mmm.

1676
02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:07,500
You know what, though?

1677
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:09,260
There's a lot of folks that, you know.

1678
02:08:09,260 --> 02:08:20,460
Yeah, those are the same people who play sports games, like football, outside, where there's

1679
02:08:20,460 --> 02:08:21,460
bears.

1680
02:08:21,460 --> 02:08:22,460
Alright.

1681
02:08:22,460 --> 02:08:27,900
The only other songs we know, other than those we just mentioned, Colors by DJ Taka from

1682
02:08:27,900 --> 02:08:32,820
Extreme is going to show up in it, and Sugaru, Revenge Vs. Desire, and then there were a

1683
02:08:32,820 --> 02:08:37,280
few more from some list I saw, but I don't remember it, so that's that.

1684
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:42,740
We have not had an official song list come out from Konami, that's the point.

1685
02:08:42,740 --> 02:08:51,740
But now that the game's gone gold, maybe they'll send some kind of, I don't know, they'll do

1686
02:08:51,740 --> 02:08:52,740
something.

1687
02:08:52,740 --> 02:08:54,740
I'm Nick Whetsek, Heidi Heidt.

1688
02:08:54,740 --> 02:08:56,740
Let's get to tonight's cage match winner.

1689
02:08:56,740 --> 02:08:58,740
Nicka, Nicka, Hi, Nicka, Johnny Ho.

1690
02:08:58,740 --> 02:09:01,740
Tonight's cage match winner, ladies and gentlemen, is...

1691
02:09:01,740 --> 02:09:03,740
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

1692
02:09:03,740 --> 02:09:04,740
It's a tie.

1693
02:09:04,740 --> 02:09:05,740
What?

1694
02:09:05,740 --> 02:09:06,740
It's a tie.

1695
02:09:06,740 --> 02:09:07,740
Between who?

1696
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:08,740
So who wins?

1697
02:09:08,740 --> 02:09:09,740
So this is how we do it.

1698
02:09:09,740 --> 02:09:11,740
Because the one song that didn't tie.

1699
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:12,740
This is the interesting thing.

1700
02:09:12,740 --> 02:09:14,740
It's a tie by one vote.

1701
02:09:14,740 --> 02:09:17,740
If one person had voted for the other song, it would have been a three-way tie.

1702
02:09:17,740 --> 02:09:19,740
So it was very close tonight.

1703
02:09:19,740 --> 02:09:20,740
Ooh, a three-way.

1704
02:09:20,740 --> 02:09:21,740
I know, ooh, a three-way.

1705
02:09:21,740 --> 02:09:33,300
So, here we go. The two songs that tied tonight were last week's winner, P8107, and the second

1706
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:41,340
song that tied tonight was Above and Beyond with Far From the Love, and Cyberex and Jodie

1707
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:53,060
Watley was one vote away. That's right, because the rules say the host whose song didn't win

1708
02:09:53,060 --> 02:09:57,020
gets to break the tie. But since she's not here, what do we do? Well, but she is here

1709
02:09:57,020 --> 02:10:01,220
in spirit because she's in the chat room, so I'm going to ask her to send her vote along.

1710
02:10:01,220 --> 02:10:06,120
So we'll find out who won the cage match after the break. I'm going to give her the break

1711
02:10:06,120 --> 02:10:11,980
to deliberate and send her a vote. Oh, never mind, she's already sent it, so let's see.

1712
02:10:11,980 --> 02:10:20,980
And the winner is, drum roll please, Jamie has voted for Far From In Love to win tonight's

1713
02:10:20,980 --> 02:10:26,820
Cage Match. So that is the winner for tonight, in a very, very close, probably the closest

1714
02:10:26,820 --> 02:10:32,500
Cage Match yet. I demand a re- Yeah, we're going to have a re-call, a re-count. It's

1715
02:10:32,500 --> 02:10:34,000
Tell your chads, people!

1716
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:34,500
Make sure you puncture-

1717
02:10:34,500 --> 02:10:38,000
Rocky's song already won two weeks in a row, it was time for it to go.

1718
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:38,500
Whatever, dude.

1719
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:42,000
He wants to do a new song next week, anyway, and she says,

1720
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Eat trance.

1721
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:46,000
When she voted for it, she said, eat trance.

1722
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
I'm not laughing.

1723
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:52,000
All right.

1724
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Uh, there you go, that's tonight's Wonder the Cage match, and goes into rotation all week long on Orange Live Radio.

1725
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
We're gonna do a break now when we come back.

1726
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
I'd like to fuck my recount, wouldn't you?

1727
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Oh

1728
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:58,000
One more time for the bad boys, baby One more time for the bad boys, baby

1729
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:19,000
One more time for the bad boys, babe

1730
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:25,960
Backwards

1731
02:13:25,960 --> 02:13:32,960
Backwards

1732
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:39,960
Backwards

1733
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:42,960
Backwards

1734
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:44,960
One more time for the backwards

1735
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:19,960
Whoa.

1736
02:15:19,960 --> 02:15:24,960
Whoa.

1737
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:29,960
Whoa.

1738
02:15:29,960 --> 02:15:34,960
Whoa.

1739
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:39,960
Whoa.

1740
02:17:09,960 --> 02:17:15,960
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge big money music and more show?

1741
02:17:15,960 --> 02:17:29,960
The music is like being transported to, uh, just this dancing spaceship place. It's, uh, unearthly. It's like being in a club, except you don't have to, you know, actually ask someone to dance.

1742
02:17:29,960 --> 02:17:38,960
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 65 in progress. And, uh, Dark Sakura's out sick tonight, unfortunately. We wish her she gets better soon.

1743
02:17:38,960 --> 02:17:41,960
Orange Lounge Radio, music you humped to.

1744
02:17:41,960 --> 02:17:47,960
Thank you. Also, Loki and I are sick, but somehow we're continuing to go on.

1745
02:17:47,960 --> 02:17:52,960
I think Loki's not quite as bad off as either Jamie or myself, and I'm probably not as bad off as Jamie.

1746
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:57,960
I talked to her on the phone earlier, she sounded pretty bad, so I'm somehow faking my way through this show tonight.

1747
02:17:57,960 --> 02:18:00,960
Joining me tonight, lankystyle, over there, hello.

1748
02:18:00,960 --> 02:18:03,960
Baka's complaining there's nothing in the webcam, so I have to go back to my crazy antics.

1749
02:18:03,960 --> 02:18:16,240
What is this you're looking at right now?

1750
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:19,800
You're looking at pictures of this bootleg Dance Dance Revolution megamix?

1751
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:24,000
We talked about this last week about Dance Dance Revolution Megamix.

1752
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:27,520
But there's pictures of it because it got bought up by a few arcades, one of them being

1753
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:35,960
Nickel City down in San Jose, and they have screenshots of it. Basically, it looks exactly

1754
02:18:35,960 --> 02:18:41,420
like DDR Extreme, except it's blue in the background. And I say blue in the background,

1755
02:18:41,420 --> 02:18:47,600
you know where there'd be green checkers? Now it's just solid blue, which is lame. But

1756
02:18:47,600 --> 02:18:51,960
that's what it is, and it's like they didn't really know what they were doing when they

1757
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:59,040
made it and I don't know it's just it's pretty lame and according to this

1758
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:05,520
there's not really any new songs that looks like I don't know all right as

1759
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:09,360
promised now it's time to get into the FUs of the week and we're gonna start

1760
02:19:09,360 --> 02:19:13,620
off with Jamie's FUs even though she's not here we do have her FUs so let's

1761
02:19:13,620 --> 02:19:14,620
Let's start.

1762
02:19:14,620 --> 02:19:32,740
F.U. to stupid people on Red Rock Online.

1763
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:33,740
No, I'm kidding.

1764
02:19:33,740 --> 02:19:34,740
I'm kidding.

1765
02:19:34,740 --> 02:19:35,740
She has real F.U.s.

1766
02:19:35,740 --> 02:19:36,740
Here they are.

1767
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:41,300
DarkSakura would like to say F.U. to being sick and that I can't take off work because

1768
02:19:41,300 --> 02:19:47,680
of my impending trip to Alabama. FU number 2 is missing the show. FU number 3 is not

1769
02:19:47,680 --> 02:19:53,680
having toilet paper. That must be an interesting house right now. Yeah, we've got plenty. Jamie,

1770
02:19:53,680 --> 02:20:00,680
you should have come over. We've got plenty. We bought like 50 gazillion packs in one at

1771
02:20:01,440 --> 02:20:08,440
Ralph's. FU number 4, my nose is rubbed raw. FU number 5, not having good food at home.

1772
02:20:08,440 --> 02:20:10,840
having good food at home

1773
02:20:10,840 --> 02:20:12,740
F you to being hot

1774
02:20:12,740 --> 02:20:16,460
F you to people who don't pay enough attention to the world around them

1775
02:20:16,460 --> 02:20:18,060
F you to selfish frivolity

1776
02:20:18,060 --> 02:20:20,300
I'm guilty of the same

1777
02:20:20,300 --> 02:20:22,700
and not being able to save money

1778
02:20:22,700 --> 02:20:26,340
F you to bad grammar and spelling and lastly F you to number ten from dark

1779
02:20:26,340 --> 02:20:30,100
sakura F you to idiots

1780
02:20:30,100 --> 02:20:33,640
Zelda? More like Zelda

1781
02:20:33,640 --> 02:20:35,400
Shut up

1782
02:20:35,400 --> 02:20:37,400
Bogey's turn, you're F-used.

1783
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:06,400
It sucks.

1784
02:21:35,400 --> 02:22:02,680
p0k3smot42o

1785
02:22:02,680 --> 02:22:04,680
p0k3smot42o i have to go to jury duty

1786
02:22:32,680 --> 02:22:37,680

1787
02:23:02,680 --> 02:23:29,960
p0k3smot42o

1788
02:23:29,960 --> 02:23:37,960
I didn't get to go out to the golf lane because I really wanted to, and, you know, circumstances prevented that, so, oh well.

1789
02:23:37,960 --> 02:23:39,960
I'm done.

1790
02:23:39,960 --> 02:23:41,960
My turn.

1791
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:49,960
Um, my biggest F.U. this week, obviously, is being sick, because when you're sick, you don't feel like doing shit.

1792
02:23:49,960 --> 02:23:50,960
um

1793
02:23:50,960 --> 02:23:55,360
F you to my friend who went out to the bar with me ice princess

1794
02:23:55,360 --> 02:23:59,300
F you to ice princess for being a drunken fucker on Friday night

1795
02:23:59,300 --> 02:24:03,800
and he was being the biggest bitch ever and he was an hour and a half late to the club

1796
02:24:03,800 --> 02:24:05,960
and no I'm not gonna get over it cause you suck

1797
02:24:05,960 --> 02:24:08,940
you made me wait at the bar for an hour and a half for you

1798
02:24:08,940 --> 02:24:13,320
and ugly old people were hitting on me and therefore you should be punished

1799
02:24:13,320 --> 02:24:16,640
and I'm gonna berate you with this forever

1800
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:21,640
And F you for getting drunk and grabbing my ass, you faggot.

1801
02:24:21,640 --> 02:24:26,640
Alright, let's move on, that's it.

1802
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:31,640
Bradley, do you have a mic over there?

1803
02:24:31,640 --> 02:24:36,640
Or Brad or Bradley, somebody?

1804
02:24:36,640 --> 02:24:41,640
Bradley's trying to get a mic.

1805
02:24:41,640 --> 02:24:46,640
dial-up

1806
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:53,640
the bedroom is back

1807
02:24:53,640 --> 02:24:57,640
with a BH

1808
02:24:57,640 --> 02:24:59,640
uh, fuck you too

1809
02:24:59,640 --> 02:25:01,640
not having any

1810
02:25:01,640 --> 02:25:03,640
hanging low, very long

1811
02:25:03,640 --> 02:25:04,640
I think this sells stuff, but

1812
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:06,640
actually that's part of the good thing that sells stuff

1813
02:25:06,640 --> 02:25:08,640
because I got too much crap as it is

1814
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:10,640
that I don't have to look at or use

1815
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:12,640
So we're gonna get rid of some of this.

1816
02:25:12,640 --> 02:25:28,640
Uh, fuck you to truck drivers, think they own the road, get up behind you, and think that you can drive faster up through the person in front of you if they just ride your ass just five things behind you.

1817
02:25:28,640 --> 02:25:29,640
Five feet behind you.

1818
02:25:29,640 --> 02:25:32,640
Uh, let's see, what else? Anything else?

1819
02:25:32,640 --> 02:25:37,640
Fuck you that I don't have any chips to eat at the cabin.

1820
02:25:37,640 --> 02:25:42,640
I forgot to buy them and fuck you forgetting to buy any apple juice.

1821
02:25:42,640 --> 02:25:47,640
So I had something to drink in the morning other than water.

1822
02:25:47,640 --> 02:25:52,640
I think it's hot.

1823
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:57,640
Whatever.

1824
02:25:57,640 --> 02:26:02,640
p0k3smot42o

1825
02:26:27,640 --> 02:26:31,640
Stovers, like, TV dinner type things, they suck.

1826
02:26:31,640 --> 02:26:34,640
Especially compared to, like, Mary Colander's, which is...

1827
02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:37,640
They are on sale, like, three out of every four weeks.

1828
02:26:37,640 --> 02:26:39,640
And are generally pretty good.

1829
02:26:39,640 --> 02:26:44,640
And, like, twice as good, twice, three times as good as those crappy dudes and shit.

1830
02:26:44,640 --> 02:26:48,640
That Stovers tries to pawn off a lot of people.

1831
02:26:48,640 --> 02:26:50,640
For three, four bucks.

1832
02:26:50,640 --> 02:26:53,640
Fuck you and your shitty meal.

1833
02:26:53,640 --> 02:26:55,640
Okay, that was stupid.

1834
02:26:55,640 --> 02:26:59,640
On to the chatroom, FUs!

1835
02:27:25,640 --> 02:27:29,640
FU to Stupid Bikers at Davis who are not using the bike circles.

1836
02:27:29,640 --> 02:27:36,640
FU to Stupid Pedestrians at Davis who think walking in the middle of the bike circles will get them across the street faster.

1837
02:27:36,640 --> 02:27:40,640
FU to the DDR Machine in Tap-X at Davis.

1838
02:27:40,640 --> 02:27:45,640
FU to More Drama and a Certain Initial D Community Cop, RTA Cop.

1839
02:27:45,640 --> 02:27:52,640
FU to the Girls who give me Dirty Looks at Paracon today just because I dress differently than they do and probably look better too.

1840
02:27:52,640 --> 02:27:56,640
And F you to the cocky bastards who think they know everything in billiards when they actually suck.

1841
02:27:56,640 --> 02:27:59,640
F you to the germs that got you three sick.

1842
02:27:59,640 --> 02:28:00,640
Thank you.

1843
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:02,640
F you to Baka for complaining.

1844
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:08,640
And F you to my friend for saying that all Loki does is bitch.

1845
02:28:08,640 --> 02:28:12,640
Can I respond to that, Loki?

1846
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:17,640
I think the segment was called F you of the week, you know, because that's where you bitch.

1847
02:28:17,640 --> 02:28:21,640
I don't know, I just, you know, I thought.

1848
02:28:21,640 --> 02:28:24,640
Oh, he's a bitch. I haven't been bitching today.

1849
02:28:24,640 --> 02:28:25,640
I've been good.

1850
02:28:25,640 --> 02:28:27,640
You've been pretty good. I'll give you that.

1851
02:28:27,640 --> 02:28:30,640
But now that he mentioned that, I'm going in.

1852
02:28:30,640 --> 02:28:32,640
Rice Princess says,

1853
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:33,640
Fuck Casey!

1854
02:28:33,640 --> 02:28:35,640
Oh, guess what? I brought actual rice today.

1855
02:28:35,640 --> 02:28:36,640
So there.

1856
02:28:36,640 --> 02:28:40,640
For all those people that said I cook with minute rice, you can suck it.

1857
02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:42,640
Are you done? Are you spent?

1858
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:45,640
Yeah, it's just, you know, fulfilling the bitching part.

1859
02:28:45,640 --> 02:28:50,640
Oh, F-you the fact that my printer didn't come with the appropriate USB cable to hook it up.

1860
02:29:20,640 --> 02:29:26,360
FU to being too broke to see Kill Bill again, and FU to Imperium for being so damn expensive.

1861
02:29:26,360 --> 02:29:32,960
I want to have the Crazy 88 Guild, dammit.

1862
02:29:32,960 --> 02:29:35,460
John Fields would like to say FU to one of my

1863
02:29:35,460 --> 02:29:40,440
Fancestar Online cards corrupting and having to start all over again, my Fomar and Raymar.

1864
02:29:40,440 --> 02:29:45,280
FU to Halo not having C co-op two player mode. FU to my school having such

1865
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:48,760
horrible pings that I can't play Halo online.

1866

f u to the forty degree days now lastly f u is not being able to download fullmetal alchemist episode 2 this weekend

1872
02:30:14,760 --> 02:30:18,760
The next thing I'm going to bitch about is having too much money, because you know, woo!

1873
02:30:21,760 --> 02:30:26,760
And she likes to agree, hee hee, dirty ball licking truck drivers, damn.

1874
02:30:27,760 --> 02:30:29,760
She was agreeing with a previous FU.

1875
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:38,760
No Stylin says, my FU is for not having any Let the Hit Dem remix ferret remix.

1876
02:30:39,760 --> 02:30:41,760
I don't know, this is No Stylin, okay?

1877
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:42,760
Okay.

1878
02:30:42,760 --> 02:30:47,720
FU to Orange Lounge for not having people on the cam besides Brad.

1879
02:30:47,720 --> 02:30:49,080
I mean, where's the rest of the crew?

1880
02:30:49,080 --> 02:30:50,880
Well, Loki's working on his computer.

1881
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:53,240
I'm trying to operate the control panel, which is off-cam.

1882
02:30:53,240 --> 02:30:54,240
They're dead!

1883
02:30:54,240 --> 02:30:55,560
They're all dead!

1884
02:30:55,560 --> 02:31:00,440
And Bradley is sitting in Jamie's hiding blue chair, so what can you do?

1885
02:31:00,440 --> 02:31:02,080
I'm boring on your way on the cam.

1889
02:31:13,280 --> 02:31:15,280
work and less time.

1890
02:31:15,280 --> 02:31:19,920
FU to the mystery buffer I just got, I should never be buffering with this connection.

1891
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:23,720
FU to the old lady driving 20 in an Audi, don't buy a car like that if you're gonna

1892
02:31:23,720 --> 02:31:24,720
drive slow.

1893
02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:33,160
FU to the song you have going for the chatroom, FUs, ha ha, love shine, love love love.

1894
02:31:33,160 --> 02:31:37,760
And lastly, Baka says, this is a good one to finish with, Baka says my FU is to Orange

1895
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:44,760
lounge radio, because you guys put the F U in fun.

1896
02:32:07,760 --> 02:32:17,240
If you want to do this or die, and we'll maybe do some Ask Orange Lounge.

1897
02:32:17,240 --> 02:32:20,560
If you have a question for Ask Orange Lounge, remember DarkSakura is not here tonight, so

1898
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:21,560
she can't answer your questions.

1899
02:32:21,560 --> 02:32:23,560
If you have a question for her, it's going to have to wait.

1900
02:32:23,560 --> 02:32:28,120
If you have something me, Loki, Brad, or Bradley could answer, hey, we'd love to help you out.

1901
02:32:28,120 --> 02:32:31,640
Send on a question and we'll do the best we can.

1902
02:32:31,640 --> 02:32:32,640
Why?

1903
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:39,640
In the meantime, let's hear, I want to hear something from BeatMania CoreMix, I think.

1904
02:32:39,640 --> 02:32:41,640
Let's hear Emotion, the romantic style.

1905
02:32:41,640 --> 02:32:43,640
No, we don't want to hear that.

1906
02:32:43,640 --> 02:32:44,640
Yes, we do.

1907
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:46,640
It was originally in BeatMania CoreMix, though.

1908
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:47,640
That's where it is.

1909
02:32:47,640 --> 02:32:48,640
I know, but that was also in Nine Style.

1910
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:49,640
Well, you know what?

1911
02:32:49,640 --> 02:32:50,640
I don't care.

1912
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:53,640
I want to hear the Yodeler remix of the DJ Battle.

1913
02:32:53,640 --> 02:32:54,640
Okay, fine.

1914
02:32:54,640 --> 02:32:56,640
We'll hear the Yodeler remix of the DJ Battle.

1915
02:32:56,640 --> 02:32:57,640
That's really annoying.

1916
02:32:57,640 --> 02:32:58,640
Fine.

1917
02:32:58,640 --> 02:32:59,640
That's the other...

1918
02:32:59,640 --> 02:33:01,640
Nuh-huh, nuh-nuh-huh-huh.

1919
02:33:01,640 --> 02:33:03,640
Instant love, what's the last thing?

1920
02:33:03,640 --> 02:33:04,640
Nuh-huh, nuh-nuh-huh-huh.

1921
02:33:04,640 --> 02:33:05,640
Instant love.

1922
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:07,640
Well, we'll see if we can fit instant love in.

1923
02:33:07,640 --> 02:33:10,640
I'll play 20 November, the final edit, too, because it's pretty good.

1924
02:33:10,640 --> 02:33:11,640
We'll be back.

1925
02:33:11,640 --> 02:33:12,640
Nuh-huh-nuh-huh.

1926
02:33:12,640 --> 02:33:13,640
I'll be back.

1927
02:33:13,640 --> 02:33:20,640
Do you really think that you can crash, Will?

1928
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:25,640
Well, if you keep up with my crash technique, I'll accept it.

1929
02:33:25,640 --> 02:33:26,640
Right?

1930
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:27,640
Get ready.

1931
02:33:27,640 --> 02:33:28,640
Get ready!

1932
02:33:57,640 --> 02:34:01,640
Alright, I'll consider your talent.

1933
02:34:01,640 --> 02:34:05,640
Look, the dance floor is waiting for you to start.

1934
02:34:05,640 --> 02:34:09,640
If you keep up with my track technique, I'll accept it.

1935
02:34:09,640 --> 02:34:12,640
All right, get ready.

1936
02:34:39,640 --> 02:34:51,480
Yes, that's a great play, look, the dance floor is waiting for you to start.

1937
02:34:51,480 --> 02:34:58,480
Christ that song is annoying, oh well, since we put the F U in fun, here you go.

1938
02:36:21,480 --> 02:36:50,480
I know you all know Beat Media, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.

1939
02:36:50,480 --> 02:36:53,480
So listen carefully and try to follow

1940
02:36:53,480 --> 02:36:56,480
The object will come down from the top

1941
02:36:56,480 --> 02:36:59,480
When it hits the red line, push the button

1942
02:36:59,480 --> 02:37:00,480
Yeah

1943
02:37:00,480 --> 02:37:04,480
When it hits the red line, turn the table

1944
02:37:04,480 --> 02:37:08,480
You get it? Alright, let's practice

1945
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:11,480
First, hit the white key

1946
02:37:11,480 --> 02:37:13,480
People know you go from above, you really know

1947
02:37:13,480 --> 02:37:15,480
Something like a face below

1948
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:22,480
Okay, now a combination of both white and black keys.

1949
02:37:22,480 --> 02:37:39,480
Okay, now a combination of both white and black keys.

1950
02:37:39,480 --> 02:37:59,480
All right, let's go on to the Scratch thing, when the objects reach the red line, Scratch!

1951
02:37:59,480 --> 02:38:03,480
With a fact note, the technique is to scratch fast.

1952
02:38:11,980 --> 02:38:15,480
Now it's all the keys and the turntable.

1953
02:38:15,480 --> 02:38:17,480
It's hard, but you can do it!

1954
02:38:36,980 --> 02:38:37,480
Okay!

1955
02:38:37,480 --> 02:38:39,480
F-Sector guys!

1956
02:38:39,480 --> 02:38:43,480
Here's the spec of the new BeatMania!

1957
02:38:43,480 --> 02:38:47,480
Look, way below, do you see the effect?

1958
02:38:47,480 --> 02:38:50,480
That's the effect on and on switch.

1959
02:38:50,480 --> 02:38:54,480
With this trimmer, you can choose your effect.

1960
02:38:54,480 --> 02:38:58,480
I'll show you, so trim with me, alright?

1961
02:39:01,480 --> 02:39:05,480
Hey, do you hear the variety of effects?

1962
02:39:05,480 --> 02:39:10,480
With this trimmer, you can change the strength and the depth of the effect.

1963
02:39:12,480 --> 02:39:17,480
This powerful sound system will make everybody hot!

1964
02:39:18,480 --> 02:39:22,480
Alright, gotta go! Do not move out with your fabulous sound!

1965
02:39:22,480 --> 02:39:26,480
I'm missing every single version of this video

1966
02:39:52,480 --> 02:39:55,480
No, nobody does, yes, baby.

1967
02:39:55,480 --> 02:39:57,480
Sign my baby balloon.

1968
02:39:57,480 --> 02:40:01,480
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

1969
02:40:01,480 --> 02:40:05,480
Sign my baby balloon.

1970
02:40:05,480 --> 02:40:07,480
Bitch, get a new song.

1971
02:40:07,480 --> 02:40:10,480
An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

1972
02:40:10,480 --> 02:40:12,480
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1973
02:40:12,480 --> 02:40:14,480
We're going to do Ask Orange Lounge here in a little bit.

1974
02:40:14,480 --> 02:40:16,480
We got a ton of freaking questions tonight,

1975
02:40:16,480 --> 02:40:19,480
so we're going to address all your questions.

1976
02:40:19,480 --> 02:40:21,480
First off, I just wanted to say, before the break,

1977
02:40:21,480 --> 02:40:25,800
For the break, I said that there's stuff you can do to help Bahmani out right now.

1978
02:40:25,800 --> 02:40:27,400
There's a couple of things.

1979
02:40:27,400 --> 02:40:35,020
First off, 2DX consumer style, the new one, at last count, they have about almost just

1980
02:40:35,020 --> 02:40:38,920
shy of 9,000 responses and they only need 10,000.

1981
02:40:38,920 --> 02:40:41,960
So in the next nine days, they're going to need 1,000 more responses.

1982
02:40:41,960 --> 02:40:50,920
So if all the listeners can get in on that, then we'll have it down to a good 998.

1983
02:40:50,920 --> 02:40:53,920
I think it's five days from now, like the 24th.

1984
02:40:53,920 --> 02:40:54,920
Is it?

1985
02:40:54,920 --> 02:40:55,920
I think it's the 24th.

1986
02:40:55,920 --> 02:40:58,920
Alright, whatever, I did my math wrong, so whatever.

1987
02:40:58,920 --> 02:41:02,920
So, there's not a lot of time left, so get your ass over to KonamiStyle and sign that.

1988
02:41:02,920 --> 02:41:07,920
I don't have a direct URL for it, sorry guys, but maybe somebody in the chat room will be kind enough to post one.

1989
02:41:07,920 --> 02:41:11,920
It's about to happen more than it was like a week, five days ago.

1990
02:41:11,920 --> 02:41:15,920
Yeah, there's a direct link on the 15th.

1991
02:41:15,920 --> 02:41:18,920
There's a direct link on BomaniStyle somewhere, so look for that.

1992
02:41:18,920 --> 02:41:22,000
speaking of the money style the other thing I was gonna say is that um they

1993
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:26,160
are going to be distributing tax new CD bounce connected but they need to get I

1994
02:41:26,160 --> 02:41:30,280
think about 200 orders for it and they only have about 75 right now I think

1995
02:41:30,280 --> 02:41:35,920
when I did the math was it oh I thought it was 25 paid and then 50 reserved I

1996
02:41:35,920 --> 02:41:41,160
was plus plus 75 but still um if you guys are interested in picking up bounce

1997
02:41:41,160 --> 02:41:44,120
connected head out of the money style it's right on the top of their page in

1998
02:41:44,120 --> 02:41:48,200
the bottom left and tell more zones radio sent you so that you know they'll

1999
02:41:48,200 --> 02:41:52,060
think we're cool and also I'm after they get money after they get bounce

2000
02:41:52,060 --> 02:41:57,180
connected ordered up they're gonna order more CDs from diverse systems one of the

2001
02:41:57,180 --> 02:42:03,460
CDs called hello boss features p8 107 so you know that's definitely a CD you're

2002
02:42:03,460 --> 02:42:08,060
gonna want to check out because it's got a ton of awesome remixes by the Japanese

2003
02:42:08,060 --> 02:42:11,860
artists who are a lot better at remixing bimani music than the American artist

2004
02:42:11,860 --> 02:42:38,860
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid questions, but I'm not singing because I'm sick so fuck off.

2005
02:42:38,860 --> 02:42:41,860
Ask some questions.

2006
02:43:08,860 --> 02:43:13,260
Next month, we're going to go MP3 Pro, which means even if you're on a modem, you can still

2007
02:43:13,260 --> 02:43:14,260
get DSL quality sound.

2008
02:43:14,260 --> 02:43:15,260
That's going to be exciting.

2009
02:43:15,260 --> 02:43:19,860
You know, I forgot to mention something with my FUs, and I was totally like past that segment,

2010
02:43:19,860 --> 02:43:27,900
but FUs are that stupid Modesto Mitsubishi commercial that lasted a good half hour.

2011
02:43:27,900 --> 02:43:30,940
You suck, and that crazy Mexican guy is funny.

2012
02:43:30,940 --> 02:43:33,340
And that put that segue into this.

2013
02:43:33,340 --> 02:43:37,380
This is why we don't put quality radio out there, because irritating radio stays with

2014
02:43:37,380 --> 02:43:43,560
you longer than quality radio. Quality radio gets forgotten. Irritating radio stays with

2015
02:43:43,560 --> 02:43:50,560
you. I just took a piss. Thank you. If you don't like our station, I challenge you to

2016
02:43:54,200 --> 02:44:01,200
do something better. Or the easy way, just fuck yourself. But I know that's not what

2017
02:44:01,200 --> 02:44:07,200
But I know that's not what you meant, so, hugs and kisses from you to me. Or from me to you.

2018
02:44:07,200 --> 02:44:09,200
Hold on, who was the one who had the question?

2019
02:44:09,200 --> 02:44:11,200
Uh, one of Violent Hypergirl's friends.

2020
02:44:11,200 --> 02:44:16,200
Oh. Sorry I don't know you, I don't want to be mean or anything, but fuck yourself.

2021
02:44:16,200 --> 02:44:20,200
Alright. My other friend wants to know the purpose of Orange Lounge Radio.

2022
02:44:20,200 --> 02:44:26,200
The purpose of Orange Lounge Radio is so that we can make asses of ourselves on the internet.

2023
02:44:26,200 --> 02:44:43,200
2. When will the next Mass Orange Lounge Radio orgy be?

2024
02:44:56,200 --> 02:45:01,200
cuz she's a chick that plays video games

2025
02:45:01,200 --> 02:45:06,200
cuz rad is so from the 80s

2026
02:45:06,200 --> 02:45:11,200
cuz she's so from the 80s

2027
02:45:11,200 --> 02:45:16,200
cuz she's so from the 80s

2028
02:45:16,200 --> 02:45:21,200
what was that brad?

2029
02:45:21,200 --> 02:45:28,200
I don't know, I don't care what Brad thinks.

2030
02:45:28,200 --> 02:45:30,240
Skye, do you enjoy saying my Nick?

2031
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:37,880
You always seem to every time you say it because I say, Ninst, it's just me being my wacky

2032
02:45:37,880 --> 02:45:38,880
DJ.

2033
02:45:38,880 --> 02:45:40,240
I'm a wacky internet DJ.

2034
02:45:40,240 --> 02:45:44,360
Ninst would like to send in this request for you give love a bad name.

2035
02:45:44,360 --> 02:45:48,640
It's 915 and 72 degrees in the Sacramento area.

2036
02:45:48,640 --> 02:45:50,200
I don't know.

2037
02:45:50,200 --> 02:45:54,040
You have a fun name to say, just like Sean the Horny Master, so it's Nince the Horny

2038
02:45:54,040 --> 02:45:55,840
Master as far as I'm concerned.

2039
02:45:55,840 --> 02:45:59,320
It's just like, you're like Casey Kasem, Lil' Jenny Sinz.

2040
02:45:59,320 --> 02:46:01,760
What was that on?

2041
02:46:01,760 --> 02:46:06,600
There was a funny joke, one comedian, I think it was on a Colin Quinn show, he was talking

2042
02:46:06,600 --> 02:46:11,640
about like Casey Kasem and stuff, and how he's like, he's like, yes, so this one is

2043
02:46:11,640 --> 02:46:15,880
for Lil' Julie, whose brother's stuck in a coma in the hospital.

2044
02:46:15,880 --> 02:46:20,560
Here is me so horny.

2045
02:46:20,560 --> 02:46:26,880
Vince would also like to know, Tuesday is coming, did you bring your coat?

2046
02:46:26,880 --> 02:46:28,360
It's from Rejected.

2047
02:46:28,360 --> 02:46:36,240
Anyway, Teehee, Teehee, Rejected Joke, hello and welcome to Last Week.

2048
02:46:36,240 --> 02:46:40,080
But son, it's only Tuesday.

2049
02:46:40,080 --> 02:46:41,560
Shut up.

2050
02:46:41,560 --> 02:46:45,360
23rd Magus would like to know, where can I find a good international lawyer?

2051
02:46:45,360 --> 02:46:52,080
I need to crack down on these illegal Portuguese joke book makers.

2052
02:46:52,080 --> 02:46:53,080
Moving on.

2053
02:46:53,080 --> 02:46:54,080
Huh?

2054
02:46:54,080 --> 02:46:58,080
Yeah, the dead silence reflects everyone everywhere in response to that segment.

2055
02:46:58,080 --> 02:47:00,600
I totally wasn't paying attention.

2056
02:47:00,600 --> 02:47:05,480
The orange lounge madam pixie dust or penne princess as she'd like to be called tonight.

2057
02:47:05,480 --> 02:47:07,440
Okay, here's a real question for Loki.

2058
02:47:07,440 --> 02:47:08,760
It's not penne.

2059
02:47:08,760 --> 02:47:10,160
It's peni.

2060
02:47:10,160 --> 02:47:13,840
I like saying penne because it sounds like T-N-A, which is what pixie dust makes me think

2061
02:47:13,840 --> 02:47:22,520
Why does Loki make fun of the fact that my F.U. goes to me having big tits? You try having

2062
02:47:22,520 --> 02:47:24,880
big boobs for a week and see how cheap you feel.

2063
02:47:24,880 --> 02:47:33,960
real? I don't even know how to respond to this. What are you talking about? He has big

2064
02:47:33,960 --> 02:47:41,200
boobs. He has big man boobs. I have nice sized breasts, but those are all my girlfriends,

2065
02:47:41,200 --> 02:47:49,680
so, you know. Oh, there you go. There you go. I don't feel cheap at all. All right.

2066
02:47:49,680 --> 02:47:58,840
I'm going back to some violent hyper girl questions here because she said a bunch.

2067
02:47:58,840 --> 02:48:02,480
Can you put the camel toe song back in circulation on Orange Lounge Radio?

2068
02:48:02,480 --> 02:48:03,480
Nope.

2069
02:48:03,480 --> 02:48:09,040
But you might hear it on one of the spinoff shows, Vanilla Sky, Monday nights at 7 o'clock

2070
02:48:09,040 --> 02:48:13,080
or pump up the volume, Jamie's Spinoff Show, Tuesday nights at 730.

2071
02:48:13,080 --> 02:48:17,640
If you're really lucky and you give them head, you might hear it on Loki's show, Live Wire,

2072
02:48:17,640 --> 02:48:28,440
coming back in November on Wednesdays.

2073
02:48:28,440 --> 02:48:32,960
Her friend wants to know, why am I so violent?

2074
02:48:32,960 --> 02:48:38,520
I would say it's all that pent up sexual energy.

2075
02:48:38,520 --> 02:48:40,520
But you know that can be fixed.

2076
02:48:40,520 --> 02:48:47,520
up sexual energy should be unleashed on the masses like a limbic break Pip has a question

2077
02:48:47,520 --> 02:48:53,800
Pip would like to know what home pads do you guys use I have an ignition camera I have

2078
02:48:53,800 --> 02:49:01,000
an ignition that was I kind of got out of a relationship because my ex has been too

2079
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:05,920
lazy to pick it up and I guess doesn't really want to talk to me so I get a ignition pad

2080
02:49:35,920 --> 02:49:40,480
One of those is mine. I have custody of one of them. They're dead. They're all dead

2081
02:49:41,200 --> 02:49:44,460
That's my Tom Cruise impersonation. Here's your goddamn ferret

2082
02:49:49,040 --> 02:49:52,060
That is all you'll hear it on this show because Jamie's not here

2083
02:49:53,560 --> 02:49:55,880
Yo, they wanted to see it on the cam. Can you put it on the cam?

2084
02:49:56,880 --> 02:49:58,880
All right

2085
02:49:58,880 --> 02:50:05,280
Kamisaki wants to know, so I've always wanted to ask you guys this, if you are called Orange

2086
02:50:05,280 --> 02:50:09,560
Lounge Radio, why don't you just play Orange Lounge Tomosuke songs all day, aside from

2087
02:50:09,560 --> 02:50:12,360
the fact that they'd repeat after an hour or so?

2088
02:50:12,360 --> 02:50:16,400
Well, you hit on the first point, it would get pretty old pretty fast.

2089
02:50:16,400 --> 02:50:21,320
Second reason is when we were picking a name for a station, since we aren't really affiliated

2090
02:50:21,320 --> 02:50:25,760
with any website or anything like that, we're just kind of an upstart thing, we didn't have

2091
02:50:25,760 --> 02:50:26,760
any built-in name.

2092
02:50:26,760 --> 02:50:30,400
So we wanted to pick a name that had something to do with Bomani.

2093
02:50:30,400 --> 02:50:34,120
And Orange Lounge just kind of clicked because, you know, on a radio talk show, what are we

2094
02:50:34,120 --> 02:50:35,120
doing?

2095
02:50:35,120 --> 02:50:36,120
We're sitting around, we're lounging around.

2096
02:50:36,120 --> 02:50:37,120
Get it?

2097
02:50:37,120 --> 02:50:42,640
And Wet Pussy Radio was already taken, so we couldn't use that one either.

2098
02:50:42,640 --> 02:50:43,640
Such a bummer.

2099
02:50:43,640 --> 02:50:44,640
And because that's what we picked!

2100
02:50:44,640 --> 02:50:45,640
So fucking put your word on it!

2101
02:50:45,640 --> 02:50:46,640
I know!

2102
02:50:46,640 --> 02:50:51,360
I wanted to be Wet Pussy Radio really bad, but unfortunately it was taken.

2103
02:50:51,360 --> 02:50:55,480
But for the record, we do play like every single Orange Lounge and Tomosuke-san.

2104
02:50:55,480 --> 02:50:56,540
They're all in rotation.

2105
02:50:56,540 --> 02:51:03,540
orange alarms kicks ass and there's a reason we named the station ever.

2106
02:51:06,660 --> 02:51:12,460
John Fields wants to know, Loki, what's your sim file number at now?

2107
02:51:12,460 --> 02:51:16,540
I don't know because I actually haven't played StepMania in like months, so I have tons of

2108
02:51:16,540 --> 02:51:22,820
them sitting on my hard drive. I just haven't gotten there. I'm probably up to 4,000 now.

2109
02:51:22,820 --> 02:51:33,020
The game sucks, it would be better if it was Gals Panic Radio.

2110
02:51:33,020 --> 02:51:37,700
Go check out Sexy Pachinko Reaction.

2111
02:51:37,700 --> 02:51:41,100
That game is the best freaking hentai arcade game I've ever seen in my life.

2112
02:51:41,100 --> 02:51:42,100
Excellent.

2113
02:51:42,100 --> 02:51:44,100
Sexy Pachinko Reaction.

2114
02:51:44,100 --> 02:51:46,500
That's an awesome radio show name.

2115
02:51:46,500 --> 02:51:47,500
By Sammy.

2116
02:51:47,500 --> 02:51:48,500
Can I get to the rest of the questions, please?

2117
02:51:48,500 --> 02:51:52,460
Beelbo Sammy, the company responsible for?

2118
02:51:52,460 --> 02:51:56,220
No Stylin' Wants to Know.

2119
02:51:56,220 --> 02:52:02,520
When will there be a Loki remix of Mr. Ferrets?

2120
02:52:02,520 --> 02:52:16,520
When will there be a Loki remix of Mr. Ferrets?

2121
02:52:16,520 --> 02:52:24,320
How many listeners do you have listening to Orange Lounge Radio right now?

2122
02:52:24,320 --> 02:52:28,680
How come 23rd Magus has bad jokes?

2123
02:52:28,680 --> 02:52:31,060
How come the sky is blue?

2124
02:52:31,060 --> 02:52:34,260
God made rivers, God made lakes, God made... no, I'm not going to say that.

2125
02:52:34,260 --> 02:52:36,340
That's too mean.

2126
02:52:36,340 --> 02:52:37,460
And I'm nice.

2127
02:52:37,460 --> 02:52:39,140
I'm on nice patrol this week.

2128
02:52:39,140 --> 02:52:41,180
How many stupid rhymes do you know?

2129
02:52:41,180 --> 02:52:42,980
I know a ton!

2130
02:52:42,980 --> 02:52:44,420
In the middle of nowhere.

2131
02:52:44,420 --> 02:52:47,180
I'm smart.

2132
02:52:47,180 --> 02:52:49,540
And well-educated.

2133
02:52:49,540 --> 02:52:51,580
Dark Sakura has another question.

2134
02:52:51,580 --> 02:52:55,060
Dear Orange Lounge, where the fuck did all the generals go on Ragnarok?

2135
02:52:55,060 --> 02:52:57,580
I want to gain another fucking level.

2136
02:52:57,580 --> 02:53:03,460
answer that but I haven't played Ragnarok in about, oh, three months. Does anybody in

2137
02:53:03,460 --> 02:53:08,540
this room play Ragnarok anymore? Never have, never will. I would be if I had money, but

2138
02:53:08,540 --> 02:53:12,860
I have no money. Guess you're fucked! Sorry, Jamie, not only are you sick, but we can't

2139
02:53:12,860 --> 02:53:19,160
answer your question. Boy, are you screwed tonight. Love ya! What? Where are the generals

2140
02:53:49,160 --> 02:53:57,520
in a way cool way man she's super rad what was the pretty bunch thing you just

2141
02:53:57,520 --> 02:54:00,000
did like a square thing with your fingers when you said she's totally not

2142
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:03,640
square that was pretty geeky but it was kind of rounded because I didn't make a

2143
02:54:03,640 --> 02:54:12,160
square it was more rectangular rounded shape maybe some sort of oval she's like

2144
02:54:12,160 --> 02:54:34,160
Sky, what would you do if you had a cute gay guy, a popsicle, and a lot of time in a bedroom?

2145
02:54:34,160 --> 02:54:59,600
I

2146
02:54:59,600 --> 02:55:02,560
What possessed you guys to start a radio station in the first place?

2147
02:55:02,560 --> 02:55:05,760
Were you high on pot or were you just drunk?

2148
02:55:05,760 --> 02:55:06,760
Little bit of both.

2149
02:55:06,760 --> 02:55:11,880
Actually, I had already been doing radio through my buddy's radio station, Undersedation Live,

2150
02:55:11,880 --> 02:55:16,160
and I had been studying radio in college, so it was nothing new to me.

2151
02:55:16,160 --> 02:55:22,800
And Dark Sacra had been guesting on Undersedation Live.

2152
02:55:22,800 --> 02:55:25,600
She did a good job when she did it, so I said, �Hey, Jamie, why don�t we do a show?�

2153
02:55:25,600 --> 02:55:29,320
And she said, �Sure!� And then Loki just started showing up, but it�s worked out

2154
02:55:29,320 --> 02:55:30,320
Nice.

2155
02:55:30,320 --> 02:55:31,320
So...

2156
02:55:31,320 --> 02:55:32,320
I was there.

2157
02:55:32,320 --> 02:55:37,280
Loki just kind of, kind of showed up, and it worked.

2158
02:55:37,280 --> 02:55:42,840
Yes, and Jamie would like to add she was also the most frequent guest on Understation Live,

2159
02:55:42,840 --> 02:55:43,840
which is true.

2160
02:55:43,840 --> 02:55:44,840
All right.

2161
02:55:44,840 --> 02:55:50,640
Biohazard also wants to know, where can I find remixes of Bamani's stuff?

2162
02:55:50,640 --> 02:55:52,240
I'll let Loki answer that.

2163
02:55:52,240 --> 02:55:54,240
The internet.

2164
02:55:54,240 --> 02:55:57,920
You want to be more specific?

2165
02:55:57,920 --> 02:56:05,800
Check out, well, I don't know, check out like BomaniSims if you want shit, but go to like

2166
02:56:05,800 --> 02:56:11,400
Diverse Systems website, they have a lot of like samples you can find.

2167
02:56:11,400 --> 02:56:17,740
Like I believe it's diverse.co.jp if I remember correctly, but if not, just check the link

2168
02:56:17,740 --> 02:56:22,880
on BomaniCell, there should be a link to their site because they're the ones that do bounce

2169
02:56:22,880 --> 02:56:24,920
connected CD.

2170
02:56:24,920 --> 02:56:30,240
So find their site and look for the artist names on there and then when you see the artist

2171
02:56:30,240 --> 02:56:35,280
names like OnoKen for instance, just search under like Yahoo or something for OnoKen then

2172
02:56:35,280 --> 02:56:40,920
BMS because all the people that do remixes on there, they make BMS files for the Beat

2173
02:56:40,920 --> 02:56:44,600
Mania Sims and they do awesome remixes on there.

2174
02:56:44,600 --> 02:56:51,920
That's how I found P8107 without buying the CD is I just rip the sound from the BMS file,

2175
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:52,920
so.

2176
02:56:52,920 --> 02:57:07,920
That's a good place to look. Just search for like Bimani remixes. You'll also find there's a site that does like a compendium of every single remix ever made and they have it organized by song that it's remixed from and you can find links on there too. So just check that out.

2177
02:57:07,920 --> 02:57:14,920
You can find them on my hard drive. I've got about over 100 of them. Quite a big collection of official ones. But you're not going to have them.

2178
02:57:14,920 --> 02:57:17,920
Here's my clever answer. Listen to Orange Lounge Radio because we play them.

2179
02:57:17,920 --> 02:57:19,920
Yay!

2180
02:57:19,920 --> 02:57:23,880
Why do you keep saying you are going to burn the ferrets and you don't?

2181
02:57:23,880 --> 02:57:28,000
Are you not able to bring yourself to set aflame, the Orange Laundry radio mascot?

2182
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:32,920
Basically, if I burn the ferrets, Jamie would kick my ass, and I know this.

2183
02:57:32,920 --> 02:57:36,440
But I'm hoping when she goes away to Alabama, she'll be gone for a good two weeks.

2184
02:57:36,440 --> 02:57:40,480
So if I set them on fire just before she leaves, she'll have the whole trip to kind of calm

2185
02:57:40,480 --> 02:57:42,800
down, and I'm hoping she'll forget by the time she gets back.

2186
02:57:42,800 --> 02:57:44,600
So have a nice trip, Jamie!

2187
02:57:44,600 --> 02:57:48,280
Also, because one of them isn't yours, and so you don't want to burn other people's stuff.

2188
02:57:48,280 --> 02:57:56,080
I would just say, you know, I'm sorry, I thought you had fire insurance.

2189
02:57:56,080 --> 02:57:59,000
For the good of all radio, I will set it on fire.

2190
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:03,700
Fire, fire will retard or whatever, yeah, I'm tired.

2191
02:58:03,700 --> 02:58:07,440
Next question, Ask Orange Lounge, we're gonna finish this up and then end the show, we gotta

2192
02:58:07,440 --> 02:58:12,400
zip through these because there's only like one minute supposedly left in the show.

2193
02:58:12,400 --> 02:58:17,240
Why did the chicken know, wait, where did you get that Mobomoga remix you hear in the

2194
02:58:17,240 --> 02:58:24,240
orange lounge radio intro.

2195
02:58:47,240 --> 02:58:52,840
Hamster Alliance is what he goes by online.

2196
02:58:52,840 --> 02:58:57,000
Navi was urging him to create a Bimani remix for a Bimani-style remix contest that they

2197
02:58:57,000 --> 02:59:01,360
had a while back, and he doesn't really like many Bimani songs, so it was a problem.

2198
02:59:01,360 --> 02:59:05,460
Mogomogas is probably his favorite song out of all of them, and he pretty much remixed

2199
02:59:05,460 --> 02:59:09,160
those 20 seconds and then said, ah, fuck it, which is too bad, because if he had remixed

2200
02:59:09,160 --> 02:59:10,160
the whole thing...

2201
02:59:10,160 --> 02:59:11,240
Best remix I've ever heard.

2202
02:59:11,240 --> 02:59:12,600
He probably would have won the whole damn thing.

2203
02:59:12,600 --> 02:59:15,680
If he would have remixed more Bimani stuff, he'd have more of a mind to it.

2204
02:59:15,680 --> 02:59:16,680
Fuck.

2205
02:59:16,680 --> 02:59:19,400
He is so talented.

2206
02:59:19,400 --> 02:59:20,400
His music is great.

2207
02:59:20,400 --> 02:59:21,400
Check out his website.

2208
02:59:21,400 --> 02:59:25,960
I just don't know what it is, but search for that name, Hamster Alliance.

2209
02:59:25,960 --> 02:59:35,080
The E at the end of Hamster, I believe, is a three, if you can't find it under Hamster.

2210
02:59:35,080 --> 02:59:39,240
The nice thing is, I asked him when he didn't end up entering it in the contest, but I heard

2211
02:59:39,240 --> 02:59:40,240
it anyway.

2212
02:59:40,240 --> 02:59:44,640
I asked him, I'm like, hey, I run a station called Orange Lounge Radio with some friends.

2213
02:59:44,640 --> 02:59:45,960
Maybe we could use that.

2214
02:59:45,960 --> 02:59:46,960
He's like, yeah, sure.

2215
02:59:46,960 --> 02:59:47,960
So, there you go.

2216
02:59:47,960 --> 02:59:52,480
Just that, whatever, how many 15 seconds you've got of it, it's like just that 15 seconds

2217
02:59:52,480 --> 02:59:55,800
is already the best remix I've ever heard, ever.

2218
02:59:55,800 --> 02:59:57,120
Yeah, huh?

2219
02:59:57,120 --> 02:59:58,880
It's so good.

2220
02:59:58,880 --> 03:00:03,280
It sounds like Crystal Method remixes, that's what I like.

2221
03:00:03,280 --> 03:00:04,280
All right.

2222
03:00:04,280 --> 03:00:08,080
We're running a little over here, but I want to address the rest of these questions.

2223
03:00:08,080 --> 03:00:13,140
Anybody have info on the StepMania SM Max 4 theme that I haven't heard about for a long

2224
03:00:13,140 --> 03:00:14,140
time?

2225
03:00:44,140 --> 03:00:45,620
two more here.

2226
03:00:45,620 --> 03:00:49,460
Biohazard also wants to know, why does the webcam face a very uninteresting area of your

2227
03:00:49,460 --> 03:00:50,460
living room?

2228
03:00:50,460 --> 03:00:52,340
Well, you know what?

2229
03:00:52,340 --> 03:00:53,340
There is no interesting area.

2230
03:00:53,340 --> 03:00:54,340
Surprise!

2231
03:00:54,340 --> 03:00:55,340
There is no interesting area.

2232
03:00:55,340 --> 03:00:56,340
I know.

2233
03:00:56,340 --> 03:00:57,340
So what do you expect?

2234
03:00:57,340 --> 03:00:59,580
Well, I could open the fridge and get the camera in the fridge.

2235
03:00:59,580 --> 03:01:00,580
That would be cool.

2236
03:01:00,580 --> 03:01:02,580
And then you would just see this be cool.

2237
03:01:02,580 --> 03:01:05,580
That would be cool.

2238
03:01:05,580 --> 03:01:08,100
All right.

2239
03:01:08,100 --> 03:01:09,100
Last question.

2240
03:01:09,100 --> 03:01:12,580
Sorry guys that sent their questions in late, but we're running over here.

2241
03:01:12,580 --> 03:01:14,900
Biohazard wants to know, why did you pick Live 365

2242
03:01:14,900 --> 03:01:17,820
to host your station and not some other place?

2243
03:01:17,820 --> 03:01:21,500
Basically, because Live 365 will pay all the licensing for you

2244
03:01:21,500 --> 03:01:22,460
as well.

2245
03:01:22,460 --> 03:01:27,060
And although I would be willing to run a shoutcast station,

2246
03:01:27,060 --> 03:01:29,620
it's just not possible because of our bandwidth.

2247
03:01:29,620 --> 03:01:32,020
Believe it or not, we have too many listeners,

2248
03:01:32,020 --> 03:01:34,060
and we wouldn't be able to maintain

2249
03:01:34,060 --> 03:01:36,300
the bandwidth for the live show.

2250
03:01:36,300 --> 03:01:37,940
We wouldn't be able to do it.

2251
03:01:37,940 --> 03:01:40,940
So sorry, we're kind of stuck with Live 365.

2252
03:01:40,940 --> 03:01:46,180
Although honestly, they're not bad because despite you guys get pop-up ads and all that

2253
03:01:46,180 --> 03:01:50,220
stuff, considering everything you get, which is licensed, paid for, radio, if you want

2254
03:01:50,220 --> 03:01:54,140
to blame somebody for the fact that Lie365 has to have all these pop-ups, blame the RIAA

2255
03:01:54,140 --> 03:01:57,780
for enacting those licensing laws and all that shit.

2256
03:01:57,780 --> 03:01:59,260
That's who's fault it is, not Lie365.

2257
03:01:59,260 --> 03:02:02,060
They do the best they can and I've been happy with them this far.

2258
03:02:32,060 --> 03:02:39,060
the

2259
03:02:39,060 --> 03:02:46,060
the

2260
03:02:48,580 --> 03:02:55,100
uh... times for everybody's final thoughts as time to wrap up the dam show

2261
03:02:55,100 --> 03:02:55,980
brad

2262
03:02:55,980 --> 03:02:57,040
final thought

2263
03:02:57,040 --> 03:03:01,180
he said he did look so good

2264
03:03:01,180 --> 03:03:02,580
was my before my mom

2265
03:03:02,580 --> 03:03:08,940
My other final thought is you smell like butt.

2266
03:03:08,940 --> 03:03:15,380
Bradley Gotta get up, gotta get moving.

2267
03:03:15,380 --> 03:03:19,500
You sound like an 80's theme song right there, thank you.

2268
03:03:19,500 --> 03:03:27,640
Loki I know I have to drink Therafloot, but lemon

2269
03:03:57,640 --> 03:03:58,640
That's it.

2270
03:03:58,640 --> 03:04:01,680
Thank you everybody for listening and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2271
03:04:01,680 --> 03:04:04,060
We do appreciate it.

2276
03:04:15,760 --> 03:04:17,600
And thanks for your support.

2277
03:04:17,600 --> 03:04:18,600
We always appreciate it.

2278
03:04:18,600 --> 03:04:19,600
The final word of the show.

2279
03:04:19,600 --> 03:04:21,520
Loki, I don't think you've ever had it.

2280
03:04:21,520 --> 03:04:22,520
What do you want?

2281
03:04:22,520 --> 03:04:24,520
Final word of the show.

2282
03:04:24,520 --> 03:04:31,520
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura,

2283
03:04:33,040 --> 03:04:39,040
Skye and Loki. We expect you a nice play again. And now, here's your fortune cookie message

2284
03:04:39,040 --> 03:04:40,040
of the day.

2285
03:04:40,040 --> 03:04:47,040
Well, as Megatron has, how shall we say, departed, I nominate myself as the new leader.

2286
03:04:47,040 --> 03:04:51,040
I nominate myself as the new leader!

2287
03:04:51,040 --> 03:04:57,040
Wait! The Constructicons form Devastator, the most powerful robot we should rule!

2288
03:04:57,040 --> 03:05:01,040
Soundwave superior, Constructicons inferior.

2289
03:05:01,040 --> 03:05:04,040
Who are you calling inferior?

2290
03:05:04,040 --> 03:05:07,040
Nobody would follow an uncharismatic bore like you!

2291
03:05:07,040 --> 03:05:11,040
Hey! Nobody calls Soundwave uncrasmatic!

2292
03:05:11,040 --> 03:05:13,320
Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week
