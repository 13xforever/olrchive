1
00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:13,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

2
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:22,237
[SPEAKER_08]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the mommy talk and then some.

3
00:00:22,937 --> 00:00:25,638
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

4
00:00:25,998 --> 00:00:30,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

5
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

6
00:00:36,022 --> 00:00:39,743
[SPEAKER_08]: You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:40,064 --> 00:00:41,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I will spank your child.

8
00:00:41,924 --> 00:00:43,665
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

9
00:00:45,494 --> 00:00:46,742
What else?

10
00:00:49,372 --> 00:00:50,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's to my big opening.

11
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:52,154
[SPEAKER_09]: A sphincter says what?

12
00:00:52,394 --> 00:00:54,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Some trooper thinks they're asking.

13
00:00:54,836 --> 00:00:57,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

14
00:00:57,438 --> 00:00:59,319
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I doing here?

15
00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:00,720
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

16
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:01,941
[SPEAKER_17]: Dodge this.

17
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:04,963
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a tasty burger.

18
00:01:05,223 --> 00:01:07,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.

19
00:01:07,885 --> 00:01:08,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I have.

20
00:01:08,946 --> 00:01:10,747
[SPEAKER_17]: Look, just a flesh wound.

21
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:17,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.

22
00:01:18,169 --> 00:01:18,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah?

23
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:22,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

24
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,730
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.

25
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:24,831
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a sniff.

26
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:25,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Sky.

27
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,811
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

28
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:28,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

29
00:01:28,952 --> 00:01:29,952
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate you!

30
00:01:30,372 --> 00:01:32,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio.

31
00:01:34,753 --> 00:01:35,733
[SPEAKER_12]: We are live.

32
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:40,134
[SPEAKER_12]: This is episode number 65 for October the 19th.

33
00:01:40,474 --> 00:01:41,255
[SPEAKER_12]: Live 65.

34
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:42,715
[SPEAKER_12]: Of 2003.

35
00:01:44,215 --> 00:01:46,916
[SPEAKER_12]: If you thought last week was a blah show, just wait for tonight.

36
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:51,928
[SPEAKER_16]: You're tuned in to the Bee Money Scenes.

37
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:54,673
[SPEAKER_16]: Most sick radio station of all things.

38
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:55,695
[SPEAKER_16]: Bee Money.

39
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:56,276
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you sick?

40
00:01:58,089 --> 00:01:59,650
[SPEAKER_16]: The whole damn world's sick today.

41
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:02,912
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you're always sick, but I mean, like, physically ill.

42
00:02:05,073 --> 00:02:05,754
[SPEAKER_16]: Not mentally ill.

43
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:06,674
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm both.

44
00:02:06,754 --> 00:02:10,897
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm physically, mentally, and I'm sick and abusive.

45
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:12,457
[SPEAKER_16]: Why did I come over here?

46
00:02:12,578 --> 00:02:14,018
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm past the contagious stage, I'm fine.

47
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:14,579
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, sure.

48
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,439
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I do the intro?

49
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,960
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I do the intro and stop?

50
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,862
[SPEAKER_16]: Won't you people let me do my job here?

51
00:02:20,402 --> 00:02:21,763
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

52
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:25,305
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Rob Roberts.

53
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:26,506
[SPEAKER_12]: You might know me as Skye.

54
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:31,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Joining me as always are half of my awesome co-hosts.

55
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,542
[SPEAKER_16]: In this corner, empty corner, the sickest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers.

56
00:02:36,562 --> 00:02:37,183
[SPEAKER_16]: You know her better.

57
00:02:37,243 --> 00:02:39,404
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura is out sick today.

58
00:02:39,984 --> 00:02:40,564
[SPEAKER_16]: I had a sniff.

59
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:46,186
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, you tell me, hold on, I'm going to stop this for a minute.

60
00:02:46,206 --> 00:02:54,410
[SPEAKER_16]: You tell me, if both me, Loki, and Jamie are all sick, what does that tell you?

61
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Somebody here last Sunday was sick.

62
00:02:59,001 --> 00:02:59,961
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm trying to get at.

63
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,861
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, but I have a feeling you guys are all having sex.

64
00:03:04,322 --> 00:03:05,222
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why you're all getting sick.

65
00:03:05,262 --> 00:03:14,144
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it could be that there's a cult going around anyways, and more than one people, you know, you know, a ton of people have it, because there's people at my work that had it before me.

66
00:03:14,804 --> 00:03:17,405
[SPEAKER_16]: So, it's obviously not just one person.

67
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,570
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be totally unrelated.

68
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially when you work at a large place like you do.

69
00:03:22,351 --> 00:03:25,112
[SPEAKER_16]: Or it could be what the most obvious answer is.

70
00:03:25,212 --> 00:03:27,393
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a government conspiracy to shut us down.

71
00:03:27,813 --> 00:03:34,195
[SPEAKER_16]: They have had bioterrorists come in and poison our food supply.

72
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,216
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank God I ate it all.

73
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:40,857
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we don't have a lot of time left.

74
00:03:43,118 --> 00:03:43,898
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, um...

75
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:46,416
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, hey.

76
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:47,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Come in.

77
00:03:47,097 --> 00:03:47,637
[SPEAKER_16]: Knock on the door.

78
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:48,838
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay, another well person.

79
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:50,279
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey.

80
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:51,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Now we can get him sick.

81
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,041
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we can get him sick, too.

82
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:56,783
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, let me finish the intro here.

83
00:03:59,145 --> 00:03:59,505
[SPEAKER_15]: See?

84
00:03:59,845 --> 00:04:05,209
[SPEAKER_16]: She got sick from work, so... Nelly.

85
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,251
[SPEAKER_16]: What happened to our intro?

86
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:09,632
[SPEAKER_16]: You stopped it.

87
00:04:10,092 --> 00:04:12,134
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, but I'm trying to play it again, and now it won't go.

88
00:04:12,514 --> 00:04:13,975
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you should have stopped it.

89
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:14,796
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, shit.

90
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:22,793
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, well... All right, all right, all right.

91
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:24,374
[SPEAKER_12]: Just forget the intro.

92
00:04:24,394 --> 00:04:24,754
[SPEAKER_16]: Forget it.

93
00:04:24,994 --> 00:04:25,334
[SPEAKER_16]: Forget it.

94
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:28,576
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

95
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,738
[SPEAKER_16]: So Jamie's not here, but she is in the chat room.

96
00:04:33,576 --> 00:04:36,017
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you want to say hello and wish her to get better soon.

97
00:04:36,578 --> 00:04:36,918
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello.

98
00:04:37,518 --> 00:04:38,359
[SPEAKER_16]: Our mics are too loud?

99
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,539
[SPEAKER_16]: I turned them down.

100
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,240
[SPEAKER_16]: Are they too loud?

101
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:40,820
[SPEAKER_16]: I turned them down.

102
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,601
[SPEAKER_16]: Are they too loud?

103
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:43,541
[SPEAKER_16]: Stop it.

104
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:44,062
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

105
00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:45,722
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for that.

106
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:47,143
[SPEAKER_16]: I haven't even introduced everyone yet.

107
00:04:47,723 --> 00:04:48,424
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they all know.

108
00:04:48,684 --> 00:04:49,044
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah, well.

109
00:04:49,104 --> 00:04:49,824
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got to introduce.

110
00:04:49,844 --> 00:04:50,785
[SPEAKER_16]: Do the introductions anyway.

111
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:52,606
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, Jamie's out sick, but she's in our chat room.

112
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,207
[SPEAKER_16]: www.callybomani.com

113
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:56,408
[SPEAKER_16]: Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.

114
00:04:56,428 --> 00:05:03,092
[SPEAKER_16]: Say hello, wish her to get better soon, and watch her berate you over typing instead of verbally tonight.

115
00:05:03,573 --> 00:05:04,033
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

116
00:05:04,894 --> 00:05:06,054
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

117
00:05:06,134 --> 00:05:08,356
[SPEAKER_16]: In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

118
00:05:10,157 --> 00:05:11,138
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello again.

119
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:19,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Not only are we sick, but we're bitchy and irritable.

120
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:20,864
[SPEAKER_10]: How is it any different than usual?

121
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:33,641
[SPEAKER_16]: Also with us tonight, filling in because he's so generous for the lack of a third person tonight, say hello to LankyStyle, also known as Brad.

122
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,523
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello LankyStyle, also known as Brad.

123
00:05:36,944 --> 00:05:41,509
[SPEAKER_16]: And then in that corner, say hello to Brad Lee, also known as Arcadian42.

124
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:47,835
[SPEAKER_16]: How are you doing, Bradley?

125
00:05:48,345 --> 00:05:48,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, good.

126
00:05:50,146 --> 00:05:52,347
[SPEAKER_16]: Usually we'd still have music playing right now, but I fucked up.

127
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:53,167
[SPEAKER_14]: He can talk, he can sing.

128
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,768
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait, I think I can get music back now.

129
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,008
[SPEAKER_16]: Hold on, hold on.

130
00:05:57,569 --> 00:05:58,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, there we go.

131
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,252
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be talking to all of them more a bit later, but first, we're going to take a quick break.

132
00:06:05,272 --> 00:06:05,852
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't do that.

133
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,154
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't do that stupid, wacky DJ stuff.

134
00:06:11,932 --> 00:06:14,154
[SPEAKER_16]: I honestly don't know how we're going to make it three hours tonight.

135
00:06:14,214 --> 00:06:14,734
[SPEAKER_16]: I really don't.

136
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:17,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki says he's got the ideas.

137
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:19,839
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I'm just going to turn this show over to Brad.

138
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:20,780
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

139
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Which one?

140
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Bradley?

141
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:22,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, here, Bradley.

142
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:23,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Both of you.

143
00:06:23,642 --> 00:06:23,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Come here.

144
00:06:27,065 --> 00:06:29,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'll take the mic outside and we'll just sit there and smoke all night.

145
00:06:30,328 --> 00:06:33,370
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll get the sound effects of cigarettes burning.

146
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:34,171
[SPEAKER_12]: Hooray.

147
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:38,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Loki wants to take the show outside.

148
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:39,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you threatening me?

149
00:06:39,513 --> 00:06:40,793
[SPEAKER_16]: No, we can't go outside.

150
00:06:40,813 --> 00:06:42,993
[SPEAKER_16]: Then we'll get the outdoors sick.

151
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:45,674
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll get kicked out of the apartment complex.

152
00:06:47,254 --> 00:06:48,274
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, we'll be back.

153
00:06:48,294 --> 00:06:49,475
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got the money news.

154
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,155
[SPEAKER_16]: How was your week?

155
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:51,155
[SPEAKER_16]: How was your day?

156
00:06:51,635 --> 00:06:54,096
[SPEAKER_16]: Cage match, FUs, all that fun stuff coming up.

157
00:06:54,976 --> 00:06:55,456
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be back.

158
00:07:07,142 --> 00:07:11,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Will we be together again?

159
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:18,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Thought the love we had was strong

160
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:25,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me what's wrong, what did we go wrong?

161
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,624
[SPEAKER_03]: And tell me what's wrong What did we go wrong

162
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:23,975
Thank you for watching!

163
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:58,753
Thank you for watching!

164
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:19,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

165
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:53,278
Niko Meow Niko Meow Niko Meow Meow Meow Meow

166
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:20,807
[SPEAKER_12]: This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

167
00:12:24,437 --> 00:12:28,118
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, all ye faithful listeners.

168
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:29,358
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what's funny?

169
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:33,539
[SPEAKER_16]: During that break, I'd say, you know what's funny?

170
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,681
[SPEAKER_16]: I looked at the numbers of how many people are listening to the station as we were on break, and I'd say about 15% of them dropped.

171
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:45,743
[SPEAKER_16]: Because they probably heard that intro where we're just like, we're sick and we don't give a fuck today.

172
00:12:46,103 --> 00:12:47,303
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're probably just like, fuck it.

173
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:49,744
[SPEAKER_16]: If it's going to be one of those shows, fuck it.

174
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:53,645
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you guys for sticking on board, ye faithful ones.

175
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:55,821
[SPEAKER_10]: or just live 365 servers.

176
00:12:55,861 --> 00:12:56,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Drop them.

177
00:12:56,702 --> 00:13:00,146
[SPEAKER_16]: Or they're just hardcore Jamie fans and they're pissed that she's not here tonight.

178
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:00,567
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

179
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:01,788
[SPEAKER_10]: That too.

180
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:02,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Most likely that's what it is.

181
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,693
[SPEAKER_16]: There's going to be a special appearance by Jamie in one way or another.

182
00:13:05,753 --> 00:13:06,875
[SPEAKER_16]: We're trying to work something out.

183
00:13:06,935 --> 00:13:07,956
[SPEAKER_16]: Because she's in the chat room.

184
00:13:08,336 --> 00:13:09,277
[SPEAKER_16]: She's cameoing in the chat room.

185
00:13:09,297 --> 00:13:10,379
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you have a special appearance?

186
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it going to jump through the matrix?

187
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:13,502
[SPEAKER_16]: Something like that.

188
00:13:13,722 --> 00:13:15,363
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll see if we can arrange something later.

189
00:13:15,763 --> 00:13:19,185
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll see if we can arrange a special visit by a sick Jamie.

190
00:13:19,705 --> 00:13:24,328
[SPEAKER_16]: And when she's sick, she's twice as bitchy, so if we can get her in for the FUs, that'll be great.

191
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:32,172
[SPEAKER_16]: So, anyway... No, it won't require you doing any work.

192
00:13:32,652 --> 00:13:33,052
[SPEAKER_16]: You're fine.

193
00:13:35,234 --> 00:13:37,635
[SPEAKER_16]: Because you're sick too, Loki, and I don't want you to have to do work.

194
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:39,909
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, you're not that sick?

195
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:40,510
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, great.

196
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,830
[SPEAKER_16]: Why don't you do the show while I go take a nap?

197
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:46,052
[SPEAKER_10]: You sick bastards.

198
00:13:46,712 --> 00:13:48,813
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right, I don't get to take a nap because I was playing video games all day.

199
00:13:48,873 --> 00:13:50,273
[SPEAKER_16]: I was playing Final Fantasy X all day long.

200
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:51,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoop-de-freaking-do.

201
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:53,094
[SPEAKER_16]: Whoop-de-freaking-do, I know.

202
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:55,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Good for you people who have American PS2s and can play that game.

203
00:13:55,955 --> 00:14:04,799
[SPEAKER_16]: For those of you who don't follow along, or I don't know if I've talked about it on Orange House Radio, I know I've talked about this plenty on Vanilla Sky, on the Monday Night Show, but I've been...

204
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,961
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm rekindling my interest in Final Fantasy X lately.

205
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:09,542
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, I'm about a year and a half late.

206
00:14:10,143 --> 00:14:13,246
[SPEAKER_16]: But for some reason I decided I wanted to play it and beat it.

207
00:14:13,426 --> 00:14:15,849
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's what I'm doing right now is I'm working my way through it.

208
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:18,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Someday I should go ahead and beat Final Fantasy IX.

209
00:14:18,932 --> 00:14:20,714
[SPEAKER_16]: I never beat IX and I never beat VIII.

210
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:22,576
[SPEAKER_10]: We probably should tackle that someday.

211
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:31,862
[SPEAKER_16]: One of these days, it was like the last Final Fantasy I actually had the patience to beat was 7, and 8 like turned me off to Final Fantasy so bad that I didn't even buy 9.

212
00:14:31,942 --> 00:14:34,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Bet you didn't even go to Sea Spirits Within, did you?

213
00:14:35,463 --> 00:14:38,384
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I went to Sea Spirits Within and it made me even sadder.

214
00:14:38,765 --> 00:14:41,466
[SPEAKER_16]: So, that's basically what happened.

215
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:50,889
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, so, on that note, let's play How Was Your Week and How Was Your Day?

216
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:53,373
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't like Jury Duty.

217
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:59,617
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't like downtown Sacramento, and I don't like the fact that Jury Duty is in downtown Sacramento.

218
00:15:14,022 --> 00:15:40,898
[SPEAKER_13]: and uh... the whole week sucked it was hell and no it'd be nice to say oh well you know jury duty's done so I get to you know go back to my work but no I have to go for the next at least two days so that sucks and I don't want to be there and but I gotta sit through it and do my quote unquote civil duty civic duty civic civil I don't give a crap think of a car Honda

219
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:44,534
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, that's what I gotta do.

220
00:15:44,574 --> 00:15:45,475
[SPEAKER_13]: That was my week.

221
00:15:45,555 --> 00:15:46,196
[SPEAKER_13]: It sucked.

222
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:47,938
[SPEAKER_16]: I had the worst day ever on Wednesday.

223
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,460
[SPEAKER_16]: I just didn't care when I got back.

224
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:57,409
[SPEAKER_16]: Then Thursday was alright because we got off at noon because they're still picking the jury because it's slow.

225
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:58,350
[SPEAKER_16]: And then...

226
00:16:00,031 --> 00:16:00,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I know this other thing.

227
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:01,812
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't kick you off the jewelry?

228
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:05,014
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't, like, say, sorry, go home?

229
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:06,934
[SPEAKER_13]: No, they actually put me on there.

230
00:16:06,974 --> 00:16:10,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, I, jeez, I got kicked off when I was on there.

231
00:16:10,196 --> 00:16:15,439
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, well, you know, they still have to go through, like, pretty much the way I figured, because I've never really been in one of these things.

232
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:25,844
[SPEAKER_16]: They've got, like, 27 people they pick, you know, first, they go in there, and then they kind of go through and eliminate people until those 27 people are all gone or either on the, um,

233
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:27,797
[SPEAKER_16]: No, jury thing.

234
00:16:28,598 --> 00:16:29,258
[SPEAKER_16]: In the jury box.

235
00:16:29,398 --> 00:16:38,825
[SPEAKER_16]: So, there's, like, still another, you know... They've only eliminated, like, four people so far, and there's still, like, another 13 people in the audience still, or whatever.

236
00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:39,286
[SPEAKER_15]: Jeez.

237
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:48,233
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, and... So, I mean, there's a chance that, you know, I might get kicked off, but... Probably not, because my luck never runs away.

238
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:49,253
[SPEAKER_10]: That's crazy.

239
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:51,135
[SPEAKER_10]: So... Four people a day.

240
00:16:52,616 --> 00:16:55,058
[SPEAKER_15]: It's supposed to only take two hours, and it's taken...

241
00:16:56,653 --> 00:16:58,795
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

242
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:23,334
[SPEAKER_15]: Thursday, they did it from 9.30 to, you know, 12.

243
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:25,755
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, that's... And still haven't eliminated them.

244
00:17:25,775 --> 00:17:30,717
[SPEAKER_10]: And they still haven't eliminated the people, because... They did it, like, in 20 minutes.

245
00:17:30,857 --> 00:17:33,958
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, I don't understand what's taking so long for this thing.

246
00:17:34,538 --> 00:17:39,320
[SPEAKER_15]: But, supposedly, they promised that the trial's supposed to be short, so... Yeah, right.

247
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, they've only got, like, four witnesses, as far as I'm aware, and so, I mean, that shouldn't take too long.

248
00:17:47,155 --> 00:17:47,576
[SPEAKER_11]: 3D sucks.

249
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:48,618
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, yes, yes.

250
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,482
[SPEAKER_16]: I just don't like downtown.

251
00:17:50,642 --> 00:17:56,735
[SPEAKER_16]: Didn't you mention when you were on the stand or whatever that you actually did a show called Orange Lounge Radio that you're a part of?

252
00:17:57,136 --> 00:17:57,357
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

253
00:17:58,257 --> 00:18:00,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Great, the government knows about us.

254
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:01,199
[SPEAKER_16]: We're fucked.

255
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:02,860
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think they care.

256
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,020
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god, you said that?

257
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:18,549
[SPEAKER_15]: It was funny though, because the prosecution, or no, the defense attorney asked me as one of the questions, because they're pulling you and asking you questions when you're on the box, because I was talking about, they're all, so what kind of music do you guys play?

258
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:18,829
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like,

259
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:20,891
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

260
00:18:37,627 --> 00:18:41,030
[SPEAKER_10]: So you said you were actually on a, did you say you had talk radio?

261
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:47,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I think they would take that as, okay, we shouldn't have him on the jury, because he might go ahead talking about the case.

262
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:58,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mentioned there was a talk radio station, and then I also, what was it, I mentioned, I was going into it, I guess I went into it a little too much, because the judge was like, did you want to give out your URL while you're at it?

263
00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:01,870
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you?

264
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,010
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

265
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn it!

266
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,331
[SPEAKER_16]: Holy shit.

267
00:19:06,031 --> 00:19:06,871
[SPEAKER_16]: That would have been great.

268
00:19:07,651 --> 00:19:10,512
[SPEAKER_16]: No, but... Damn it, why didn't you have the business cards?

269
00:19:10,612 --> 00:19:11,553
[SPEAKER_16]: We have the business cards.

270
00:19:11,573 --> 00:19:14,414
[SPEAKER_16]: You could offer the judge a business card, he would have gotten kicked off the jury right there.

271
00:19:14,494 --> 00:19:14,894
[SPEAKER_16]: Come on.

272
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:17,855
[SPEAKER_16]: And he would have had our URL.

273
00:19:19,622 --> 00:19:21,443
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'd rather not.

274
00:19:21,783 --> 00:19:25,825
[SPEAKER_15]: But anyways, the defense attorney, though, she knew what we were talking about.

275
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:29,727
[SPEAKER_15]: She's like, so what kind of video games do you guys talk about?

276
00:19:29,787 --> 00:19:30,907
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, oh, mostly the music games.

277
00:19:30,927 --> 00:19:34,149
[SPEAKER_16]: She's like, oh, like that game where you step on the arrows?

278
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:35,990
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait, wait, I just have to ask real fast.

279
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,311
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you have to define what speed music was?

280
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:39,772
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I did not.

281
00:19:40,772 --> 00:19:41,813
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a bunch of crap!

282
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:44,614
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a bunch of crap!

283
00:20:11,064 --> 00:20:14,886
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't give it out to the whole jury because half those people I don't think know what a computer is.

284
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Were you being interviewed in front of the other jury members?

285
00:20:17,988 --> 00:20:19,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, the whole people.

286
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:20,090
[SPEAKER_10]: How many people were there?

287
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,890
[SPEAKER_10]: About 27.

288
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:21,150
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all?

289
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:24,550
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, not including no jury.

290
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,671
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, not jury.

291
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:37,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Not including the attorneys, the defense, the defendant, and all the judge, the bailiff.

292
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:39,142
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically you have no shame.

293
00:20:39,162 --> 00:20:40,343
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

294
00:20:40,623 --> 00:20:43,025
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't get up on the stand and say that I do those things.

295
00:20:43,085 --> 00:20:43,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

296
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:49,851
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd so be ashamed of this because they come on here and they find out what a big fag I am in like 15 seconds.

297
00:20:51,135 --> 00:20:54,297
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, for some reason... Wait, would they kick you off the jury for being a homosexual?

298
00:20:55,758 --> 00:20:56,018
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

299
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:59,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe if the case has something to do with that.

300
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, they don't... Usually they'll pick a jury and they ask you questions and they're looking for things that may give you a biased opinion during the jury.

301
00:21:05,563 --> 00:21:06,324
[SPEAKER_15]: But here's the thing, though.

302
00:21:06,424 --> 00:21:12,027
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like... I don't understand about much... I don't know much about how the jury system works and everything, but...

303
00:21:14,153 --> 00:21:15,094
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

304
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:29,789
[SPEAKER_15]: It's pretty much like that.

305
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,811
[SPEAKER_15]: And they keep asking the same question until they finally said no.

306
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:40,914
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because they can't lead the witnesses in the case, so they just lead the jury members to pick the ones they want.

307
00:21:41,654 --> 00:21:43,575
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a very slow process.

308
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:44,635
[SPEAKER_15]: Very slow.

309
00:21:45,656 --> 00:21:50,398
[SPEAKER_15]: And I hope to God that we actually start the trial on Monday because...

310
00:21:51,155 --> 00:21:52,616
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

311
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:25,084
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, lunch comes, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, it's almost time to go home, it's 3 o'clock, we get to leave at 3.30 if we're not called in, and we're done.

312
00:22:25,384 --> 00:22:26,085
[SPEAKER_16]: We're done for good.

313
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:33,569
[SPEAKER_16]: So, as you would know, at 3.15, they call in the last group, and my name is the last one called on that group.

314
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:35,730
[SPEAKER_15]: So, it's like, fuck.

315
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:38,592
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm like, okay, settle, settle, settle, settle, no.

316
00:22:39,573 --> 00:22:39,873
[SPEAKER_16]: So...

317
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:43,003
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you get sequestered.

318
00:22:44,724 --> 00:22:45,584
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be funny.

319
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:47,945
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not going to happen.

320
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:50,146
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think so.

321
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:56,869
[SPEAKER_16]: What little I did find out about what's going on, it's not that big deal.

322
00:22:57,329 --> 00:23:01,891
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I mean, to somebody it's a big deal, but, you know, it's not going to be on the news or anything.

323
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:04,011
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not talking like a high-profile case.

324
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:04,652
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just...

325
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:08,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, you would have been able to tell as soon as you went in there.

326
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:11,813
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they have a completely different type of process.

327
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:12,854
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

328
00:23:13,614 --> 00:23:15,234
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to be out of there.

329
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,355
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's not a matter of, like, I don't like jury duty.

330
00:23:18,475 --> 00:23:18,815
[SPEAKER_16]: It's fine.

331
00:23:18,915 --> 00:23:20,455
[SPEAKER_16]: I just really hate downtown SAC.

332
00:23:20,855 --> 00:23:21,875
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate driving down there.

333
00:23:23,116 --> 00:23:25,696
[SPEAKER_15]: Honestly, I hate everything about downtown SAC.

334
00:23:26,096 --> 00:23:29,317
[SPEAKER_15]: It is impossible to find any place to eat down by the jury place.

335
00:23:29,417 --> 00:23:33,038
[SPEAKER_15]: I walked around blocks just looking for, you know, a restaurant.

336
00:23:33,118 --> 00:23:33,778
[SPEAKER_15]: It just sucks.

337
00:23:34,338 --> 00:23:41,083
[SPEAKER_15]: and then, you know, in fact, I have to get there two hours early in order to get a parking space, you know, a free parking space.

338
00:23:41,244 --> 00:23:44,566
[SPEAKER_15]: Otherwise, I have to pay $6 a day, you know, for parking.

339
00:23:45,247 --> 00:23:45,767
[SPEAKER_16]: No, they don't.

340
00:23:47,889 --> 00:23:49,670
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, way to go, city of Sacramento.

341
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,511
[SPEAKER_15]: You rock, you know.

342
00:23:50,831 --> 00:23:58,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Not only do you pay me only $15 to go to Jury Duty, but half that money is going to go to parking because you don't provide enough parking.

343
00:23:59,017 --> 00:23:59,878
[SPEAKER_13]: How fucking lame.

344
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,321
[SPEAKER_14]: But, um... It'll all be over soon.

345
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,115
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, I got it good.

346
00:24:06,135 --> 00:24:14,057
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, there were some people there, they were talking about like, some of the jurors that were there were talking about how they got to sit on another trial, and they were going to be picked on their own.

347
00:24:14,237 --> 00:24:21,458
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the, you know, they were asking if anyone has any hardships, you know, normally involving the trial, like it's going to take too long or something.

348
00:24:21,518 --> 00:24:23,278
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the trials was going to take three weeks.

349
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:26,079
[SPEAKER_16]: I was like, oh, thank God I wasn't on that one.

350
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:27,239
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, that would have sucked.

351
00:24:27,939 --> 00:24:29,279
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, no way.

352
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:32,000
[SPEAKER_16]: I wouldn't have done it.

353
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,020
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd be all, sorry, I'm on vacation next week.

354
00:24:34,847 --> 00:24:36,848
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'd be like, my work's not gonna pay me.

355
00:24:37,568 --> 00:24:45,030
[SPEAKER_10]: You find out what the case is about, and then you make the most stupided statement that make them totally think that you'd be the wrong person to pick.

356
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:53,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, say it's about a gay person being, you know, beaten up, that you say that you're a freaking anti-gay, you know?

357
00:24:54,172 --> 00:24:55,112
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't work that way.

358
00:24:55,413 --> 00:24:58,834
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't work that way because they tell you from the beginning what the case is gonna be about.

359
00:24:59,114 --> 00:25:00,474
[SPEAKER_13]: You pretty much can, it's just...

360
00:25:02,443 --> 00:25:04,726
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really the whole system is flawed the way they do it.

361
00:25:04,966 --> 00:25:08,590
[SPEAKER_13]: But I guess it works because they have so many trials a day.

362
00:25:09,572 --> 00:25:14,337
[SPEAKER_15]: But it doesn't make any sense because it's like, well, any idiot can find a way out of it.

363
00:25:14,738 --> 00:25:20,124
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just, I guess, on the honor system, which isn't worth much nowadays.

364
00:25:20,525 --> 00:25:20,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

365
00:25:21,912 --> 00:25:26,294
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how, I guess I was just too young, because I think I got called in, like, on my 18th birthday.

366
00:25:26,354 --> 00:25:30,036
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I swear, it was like, as soon as I could go to jury duty, I was called.

367
00:25:30,876 --> 00:25:33,717
[SPEAKER_10]: And they were just like, I think they just thought I was too young, and they sent me home.

368
00:25:34,178 --> 00:25:35,718
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, thank goodness, I don't want to be here.

369
00:25:35,738 --> 00:25:39,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it's like there are people, like, they're all, what kind of...

370
00:25:40,095 --> 00:25:42,356
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't even know how they can have a hardship.

371
00:25:42,716 --> 00:25:47,137
[SPEAKER_15]: The trial's going to last like two days once they get the jury selected.

372
00:25:47,497 --> 00:25:50,158
[SPEAKER_15]: And you're like, oh, poor me, poor me.

373
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:54,620
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to have enough money to make rent because I missed two days of work.

374
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's kind of how it is for some people.

375
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well.

376
00:25:58,101 --> 00:26:02,922
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, and you miss rent and it could script your life.

377
00:26:03,002 --> 00:26:05,003
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's not just any laughing matter.

378
00:26:05,043 --> 00:26:06,963
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a bunch of bullshit the way I have it set up.

379
00:26:08,044 --> 00:26:08,444
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway.

380
00:26:08,864 --> 00:26:09,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

381
00:26:11,906 --> 00:26:16,588
[SPEAKER_16]: Rice Princess is suggesting if you wanted to get out of jury duty, you could have told them that you make sweet love to sheep.

382
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:23,012
[SPEAKER_13]: That doesn't have anything to do with the trial, though.

383
00:26:24,152 --> 00:26:24,853
[SPEAKER_13]: So that wouldn't work.

384
00:26:24,873 --> 00:26:27,854
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, how would they ever find a juror in Chico if that's the case?

385
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:28,755
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I want to know.

386
00:26:29,775 --> 00:26:32,897
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, anything else you want to say about your day and your week?

387
00:26:34,958 --> 00:26:36,539
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I really didn't do much.

388
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:40,881
[SPEAKER_15]: I just was, like, so preoccupied with this stupid jury crap that's, like,

389
00:26:44,692 --> 00:26:55,040
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought it was going to rain today, and I looked outside, but according to the weather, it's not going to rain for a while.

390
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,982
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, I don't know.

391
00:26:59,022 --> 00:27:00,063
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just supposed to get warmer.

392
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:01,464
[SPEAKER_15]: It's supposed to be like the 90s.

393
00:27:02,285 --> 00:27:02,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Ew.

394
00:27:03,198 --> 00:27:08,922
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, I'm just pretty much just doing like running around and stuff today.

395
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:13,686
[SPEAKER_15]: I went grocery shopping because I needed to do that and that's about it.

396
00:27:13,706 --> 00:27:17,348
[SPEAKER_15]: I was supposed to try to find a Halloween costume because I had to go to a party.

397
00:27:17,768 --> 00:27:18,389
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if I'm going to

398
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:20,230
[SPEAKER_15]: You haven't figured out what you're dressing up as yet?

399
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:25,675
[SPEAKER_15]: I had an idea, but there's just a problem is no one seems to have the costume that I want.

400
00:27:25,775 --> 00:27:26,576
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I had a couple ideas.

401
00:27:26,656 --> 00:27:30,359
[SPEAKER_15]: First off was, um, the Mad Hatter, which is kind of cool.

402
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,342
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, just do like an evil Mad Hatter type thing.

403
00:27:34,202 --> 00:27:36,464
[SPEAKER_15]: I could probably do that, and it's like, eh.

404
00:27:36,744 --> 00:27:40,648
[SPEAKER_15]: Then I could dress up like Neo from Matrix, because I already have a trench coat and glasses.

405
00:27:41,228 --> 00:27:44,071
[SPEAKER_15]: But really, it's the wrong kind of trench coat and stuff, and...

406
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,300
[SPEAKER_15]: That would kind of suck.

407
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Then my other one was the charred corpse of an astronaut.

408
00:27:49,221 --> 00:27:50,021
[SPEAKER_15]: You are horrible.

409
00:27:50,661 --> 00:27:54,062
[SPEAKER_16]: So I thought that would be kind of cool, because all you have to do is find an astronaut costume.

410
00:27:54,102 --> 00:27:56,383
[SPEAKER_16]: But you know, you'd be surprised that there's not that many out there.

411
00:27:56,403 --> 00:27:58,523
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess no one wants to dress up like an astronaut this year.

412
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:03,084
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope you wouldn't be seen in public with that on, because you'd get beat up by somebody.

413
00:28:04,045 --> 00:28:05,145
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, by the astronauts?

414
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:07,486
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait, they can't, because they're charred corpses.

415
00:28:08,346 --> 00:28:09,086
[SPEAKER_16]: You're horrible.

416
00:28:13,357 --> 00:28:14,658
[SPEAKER_16]: I said you should have been a princess.

417
00:28:15,518 --> 00:28:16,279
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't want to be a princess.

418
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:18,720
[SPEAKER_16]: Because that would be ironic.

419
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,121
[SPEAKER_15]: My co-worker is supposed to dress up like a dominatrix.

420
00:28:22,402 --> 00:28:23,082
[SPEAKER_15]: That's kind of cool.

421
00:28:23,742 --> 00:28:26,324
[SPEAKER_15]: Except she wouldn't be a good dominatrix.

422
00:28:27,144 --> 00:28:29,185
[SPEAKER_15]: Now our other co-worker is the slut.

423
00:28:29,225 --> 00:28:30,386
[SPEAKER_15]: She'd be a good dominatrix.

424
00:28:32,867 --> 00:28:33,347
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's all.

425
00:28:34,247 --> 00:28:34,648
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

426
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:35,688
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't give me the microphone.

427
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:37,189
[SPEAKER_16]: After comments like that.

428
00:28:39,253 --> 00:28:40,833
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll talk about my day and my week.

429
00:28:40,873 --> 00:28:45,054
[SPEAKER_16]: But first, I have to address the chat room because they're talking about me in there.

430
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:47,615
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not funny.

431
00:28:47,675 --> 00:28:48,595
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, it is funny.

432
00:28:48,795 --> 00:28:49,375
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it's not.

433
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:49,855
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, it is.

434
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:54,696
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I look like absolute shit today and I don't even know why I'm sitting on the cam.

435
00:28:54,736 --> 00:28:58,557
[SPEAKER_16]: I should take the opportunity to sit in Jamie's hidden blue chair while she's not here.

436
00:28:58,997 --> 00:29:00,197
[SPEAKER_16]: But for whatever reason, I'm lazy.

437
00:29:00,237 --> 00:29:01,437
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't feel like getting up off the couch.

438
00:29:01,817 --> 00:29:05,638
[SPEAKER_16]: And I look really ugly today because I haven't really taken a shower.

439
00:29:06,218 --> 00:29:06,498
[SPEAKER_16]: Shut up.

440
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:09,221
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

441
00:29:25,301 --> 00:29:27,102
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even want to dignify that with a comment.

442
00:29:27,122 --> 00:29:27,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you read it?

443
00:29:27,982 --> 00:29:28,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I did.

444
00:29:28,663 --> 00:29:29,163
[SPEAKER_10]: It's funny.

445
00:29:29,263 --> 00:29:30,144
[SPEAKER_16]: I can read the chat rooms.

446
00:29:30,164 --> 00:29:33,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, everybody in the chat room is listening to the radio show, so they already pretty much know.

447
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:39,350
[SPEAKER_16]: Some people in the chat room, well, not everybody who listens to the show gets in a chat room either, which just makes me sad.

448
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:43,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, for those not in the chat room, never mind.

449
00:29:43,773 --> 00:29:44,293
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

450
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,455
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really too disgusting to say on air anyway.

451
00:29:46,575 --> 00:29:47,335
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good bread.

452
00:29:48,676 --> 00:29:49,396
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm dissing you.

453
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:51,298
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not supposed to say that's good.

454
00:29:52,981 --> 00:29:54,802
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to talk about it.

455
00:29:54,822 --> 00:29:55,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Joke's on you.

456
00:29:55,302 --> 00:29:56,022
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to go there.

457
00:29:57,002 --> 00:30:01,704
[SPEAKER_16]: Neither do I. The rest of my week was really pretty boring.

458
00:30:02,184 --> 00:30:07,565
[SPEAKER_16]: Tuesday and Wednesday was DDR Extreme most of the afternoon because we finally picked it up on Tuesday.

459
00:30:08,786 --> 00:30:10,086
[SPEAKER_16]: But we'll get into that later.

460
00:30:10,106 --> 00:30:11,786
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll talk about DDR Extreme later.

461
00:30:11,806 --> 00:30:13,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I was so bored on Thursday.

462
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:15,207
[SPEAKER_16]: I played that damn game all day.

463
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:16,388
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know what?

464
00:30:16,428 --> 00:30:18,808
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the only time I'll ever play that damn game.

465
00:30:18,888 --> 00:30:20,829
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was nice while it lasted.

466
00:30:22,336 --> 00:30:23,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Extreme is disappointing.

467
00:30:24,477 --> 00:30:25,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Very disappointing.

468
00:30:26,018 --> 00:30:26,598
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll get to that later.

469
00:30:27,138 --> 00:30:27,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we are?

470
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:31,720
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, well, we need topics to fill three hours, so let's not blow our load all at once here, please.

471
00:30:33,981 --> 00:30:34,661
[SPEAKER_16]: You're a dick.

472
00:30:35,282 --> 00:30:43,045
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, and then Thursday I started feeling sick, so I didn't really want to do shit after that, because Thursday I had to go run errands out in Roseville.

473
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:44,966
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't even bother to go by Golfland.

474
00:30:46,306 --> 00:30:47,587
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, God, what the hell...

475
00:30:49,156 --> 00:30:54,238
[SPEAKER_16]: I was supposed to go out Thursday night and I didn't because I was feeling sick.

476
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,559
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what, I did go out last night though.

477
00:30:56,579 --> 00:31:02,662
[SPEAKER_16]: I went out dancing last night and it was kind of interesting because I was hearing all these new Bomani songs that they were playing.

478
00:31:03,022 --> 00:31:07,784
[SPEAKER_16]: Like the DJ at the club last night, oh no, Friday night, I meant Friday night, not last night.

479
00:31:08,845 --> 00:31:09,325
[SPEAKER_16]: My bad.

480
00:31:10,185 --> 00:31:22,501
[SPEAKER_16]: Friday night I went out and the DJ there was really really horrible like he was mixing songs together like not how you know most DJs mix songs together how they transition one song into another oh like I do

481
00:31:23,973 --> 00:31:25,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but no, it was different, no.

482
00:31:25,474 --> 00:31:26,535
[SPEAKER_10]: He put Gravity in the background.

483
00:31:26,555 --> 00:31:29,197
[SPEAKER_16]: He didn't put Thought, yeah, no, he wasn't mixing Gravity into it either.

484
00:31:29,797 --> 00:31:31,718
[SPEAKER_16]: He put Thought, he didn't put any Thought into it.

485
00:31:31,778 --> 00:31:33,959
[SPEAKER_16]: He would just mix two records together on top of each other.

486
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,200
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, like I do.

487
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:35,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

488
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:41,744
[SPEAKER_16]: But, like, no, what's funny is that I'm thinking about all these, like, new Bomani songs he was playing.

489
00:31:41,784 --> 00:31:45,366
[SPEAKER_16]: He was playing a song that's going to be in DDR Xbox, that Shiny Disco Ball song.

490
00:31:45,386 --> 00:31:45,666
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, God.

491
00:31:45,706 --> 00:31:47,127
[SPEAKER_16]: Which I know we talked about a couple weeks ago on here.

492
00:31:47,608 --> 00:31:49,229
[SPEAKER_16]: And then he was playing Sandstorm, too.

493
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:52,512
[SPEAKER_16]: And he was like mixing these two songs together.

494
00:31:52,672 --> 00:31:54,013
[SPEAKER_16]: It really, really sucked.

495
00:31:54,053 --> 00:31:58,217
[SPEAKER_16]: Like it was... Late Night, Disco Balls.

496
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:00,019
[SPEAKER_16]: Shiny, Disco Balls.

497
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,740
[SPEAKER_16]: Late Night, Booty Calls.

498
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:02,481
[SPEAKER_16]: It was really awful.

499
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:09,248
[SPEAKER_16]: People like that are getting jumped.

500
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,729
[SPEAKER_16]: He was obviously new.

501
00:32:10,989 --> 00:32:12,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you should be a DJ.

502
00:32:12,511 --> 00:32:14,453
[SPEAKER_16]: You could be a DJ at a gay bar so easy.

503
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:18,199
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, what do you mean by that?

504
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,063
[SPEAKER_16]: I just mean, you know, because you like gay music, it's alright.

505
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:22,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey!

506
00:32:24,886 --> 00:32:25,586
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just kidding.

507
00:32:25,907 --> 00:32:27,168
[SPEAKER_13]: My music is pure hetero.

508
00:32:27,188 --> 00:32:29,410
[SPEAKER_13]: You're the only straight guy I know with a Madonna vinyl.

509
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,051
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not a professional DJ already.

510
00:32:32,152 --> 00:32:33,233
[SPEAKER_16]: I have more than one.

511
00:32:33,253 --> 00:32:35,235
[SPEAKER_16]: I have like three or four of them.

512
00:32:35,255 --> 00:32:36,716
[SPEAKER_16]: You're just making my point.

513
00:32:37,117 --> 00:32:42,161
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the My Girl Likes to Party All the Time record that really scares me.

514
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,171
[SPEAKER_10]: He says he's guilty there.

515
00:32:46,211 --> 00:32:46,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but that's not gay.

516
00:32:47,171 --> 00:32:47,832
[SPEAKER_10]: That's stupid.

517
00:32:47,852 --> 00:32:49,112
[SPEAKER_10]: That is so gay.

518
00:32:49,212 --> 00:32:49,973
[SPEAKER_10]: That's stupid.

519
00:32:50,793 --> 00:32:51,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

520
00:32:52,654 --> 00:32:55,216
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're gay, and you're stupid, so it works.

521
00:32:57,597 --> 00:33:00,879
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, DarkTetsuya in the chatroom says, shiny sandstorm balls.

522
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:01,359
[SPEAKER_16]: That was it.

523
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,641
[SPEAKER_16]: Shiny sandstorm balls.

524
00:33:03,661 --> 00:33:04,321
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that about something?

525
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:05,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Shiny sandstorm balls.

526
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:09,515
[SPEAKER_16]: God, what other... I was hearing a ton of, like, new Bomani songs at the club.

527
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:11,957
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, I heard Love at First Sight, Stomp to My Beat.

528
00:33:11,977 --> 00:33:15,340
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, all these ones that you hear in... Well, they're not really Bomani songs.

529
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:20,064
[SPEAKER_16]: They're not, but, you know, it's still neat to sit there and go, Oh my God, that's in DDR.

530
00:33:20,304 --> 00:33:20,745
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

531
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,726
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not quite what it used to be.

532
00:33:22,746 --> 00:33:25,088
[SPEAKER_10]: When he plays Max Period, I'll be like, Okay.

533
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:26,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you're right.

534
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:28,992
[SPEAKER_16]: You're never going to hear a Konami original there, but... I wish.

535
00:33:29,472 --> 00:33:32,254
[SPEAKER_16]: I would love to hear Ecstasy at the dance club.

536
00:33:33,021 --> 00:33:33,601
[SPEAKER_16]: That's one thing.

537
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:39,345
[SPEAKER_16]: But I remember, like, when I was first getting into DDR, back when, like, DDR USA was the only game there was to play, right?

538
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:43,007
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you know, around here, USA was the only game there was to play.

539
00:33:44,368 --> 00:33:49,771
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember going out to the club with a couple of Bomani friends, and we heard Stomp to my beat, and it was like, yeah!

540
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:53,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I the only person who heard Stomp to my beat before it came out on DDR?

541
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:56,074
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I had heard it before, too, but it got better.

542
00:33:56,355 --> 00:33:58,696
[SPEAKER_16]: You used to listen to it all the time when we played Cusar.

543
00:34:02,506 --> 00:34:05,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, they used to play it on Power 105.5 here all the time.

544
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is just a local thing to say, but... That's right.

545
00:34:10,933 --> 00:34:14,296
[SPEAKER_16]: There was a radio station that used to play dance music, and it was big before DDR was around.

546
00:34:14,776 --> 00:34:16,878
[SPEAKER_16]: And too bad the damn station isn't around anymore.

547
00:34:16,898 --> 00:34:18,239
[SPEAKER_16]: It was the best station this town ever had.

548
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:19,840
[SPEAKER_16]: Now it's Power 105.5 The Fish.

549
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,882
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it's No Power 105.5 The Fish.

550
00:34:23,303 --> 00:34:24,004
[SPEAKER_16]: It's possible, I mean, because...

551
00:34:40,563 --> 00:34:42,084
[SPEAKER_16]: They are... That's the kind of stuff they would play.

552
00:34:42,124 --> 00:34:44,185
[SPEAKER_16]: A European... Anyway.

553
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:45,766
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, I'm off on a tangent.

554
00:34:45,786 --> 00:34:46,287
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me come back now.

555
00:34:46,307 --> 00:34:47,087
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you saying?

556
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:47,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

557
00:34:47,647 --> 00:34:48,268
[SPEAKER_16]: Stomp to my beat.

558
00:34:48,348 --> 00:34:51,970
[SPEAKER_16]: And when we go to the club, and now it's in DDR.

559
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,431
[SPEAKER_16]: So now we already like stomp to my beat.

560
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:54,191
[SPEAKER_16]: Now it's in DDR.

561
00:34:54,411 --> 00:34:56,852
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'd be at the club and we would actually do the dance.

562
00:34:56,892 --> 00:34:59,914
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, like we do it where we go step, step, step, step, step.

563
00:35:00,495 --> 00:35:01,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, just like it was in stomp to my beat.

564
00:35:02,536 --> 00:35:04,437
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

565
00:35:04,517 --> 00:35:06,218
[SPEAKER_16]: Left, left, left, down.

566
00:35:06,278 --> 00:35:06,518
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway.

567
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:08,052
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll shut up now.

568
00:35:08,353 --> 00:35:08,913
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm leaving.

569
00:35:09,153 --> 00:35:09,493
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

570
00:35:09,613 --> 00:35:10,174
[SPEAKER_16]: You scare me.

571
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:10,574
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

572
00:35:12,415 --> 00:35:12,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

573
00:35:13,176 --> 00:35:15,777
[SPEAKER_16]: So you did, uh, Riverdance, basically.

574
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:20,480
[SPEAKER_16]: RicePrincess says that the first time she heard Stomp To My Beat was when she went to go watch Strippers.

575
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:23,302
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if that's the first, but she heard it.

576
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:26,604
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of weird, though, to have them play that in a strip club.

577
00:35:26,884 --> 00:35:27,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey.

578
00:35:27,945 --> 00:35:29,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Stomp To My Beat, stomp on my face.

579
00:35:31,024 --> 00:35:31,785
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I don't get it.

580
00:35:33,126 --> 00:35:33,787
[SPEAKER_16]: Sit on my face.

581
00:35:33,807 --> 00:35:34,728
[SPEAKER_16]: She was sitting on my face.

582
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:37,210
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, that was really bad.

583
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:37,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Stomp on my cock.

584
00:35:40,693 --> 00:35:42,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Stomp on my cock, Loki says.

585
00:35:43,215 --> 00:35:43,936
[SPEAKER_10]: No, thank you.

586
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,101
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess I'm done.

587
00:35:51,846 --> 00:35:52,546
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's it.

588
00:35:52,906 --> 00:35:53,227
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

589
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:54,007
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh!

590
00:35:54,587 --> 00:35:56,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Jamie's reminded me of another time we heard Stomp to My Beat.

591
00:35:57,248 --> 00:36:03,730
[SPEAKER_16]: It was when, um, you remember when we, like, all the Sacramento people used to go to Roseville Golf Land every, like, Thursday night or Wednesday night?

592
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,391
[SPEAKER_16]: It was one of the two nights.

593
00:36:04,511 --> 00:36:05,831
[SPEAKER_16]: We used to go every Wednesday, Thursday night.

594
00:36:05,871 --> 00:36:08,312
[SPEAKER_16]: One time we were at Brookfield's and we heard Stomp to My Beat in the kitchen.

595
00:36:09,812 --> 00:36:11,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god.

596
00:36:11,513 --> 00:36:13,294
[SPEAKER_16]: We had an oh my gods, it's DDR moment.

597
00:36:13,854 --> 00:36:14,754
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, I'll shut up now.

598
00:36:16,655 --> 00:36:17,055
[SPEAKER_16]: Brad!

599
00:36:18,215 --> 00:36:18,836
[SPEAKER_16]: How was your day?

600
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:19,416
[SPEAKER_16]: How was your week?

601
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:25,135
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty much it.

602
00:36:25,995 --> 00:36:28,678
[SPEAKER_10]: No, uh, fuck, nothing really.

603
00:36:28,738 --> 00:36:30,819
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I've been playing PSO.

604
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:31,400
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why.

605
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,121
[SPEAKER_10]: I just have this urge to play PSO again.

606
00:36:34,523 --> 00:36:36,264
[SPEAKER_10]: And not online because I'm playing on Dreamcast.

607
00:36:36,324 --> 00:36:39,006
[SPEAKER_12]: And that would be Phantasy Star Online for the uninitiated.

608
00:36:39,307 --> 00:36:41,869
[SPEAKER_10]: If anybody doesn't know what PSO is, there's something wrong.

609
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,191
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like saying, what's Auro?

610
00:36:45,032 --> 00:36:45,732
[SPEAKER_10]: What the fuck?

611
00:36:46,032 --> 00:36:46,753
[SPEAKER_10]: What's EQ?

612
00:36:48,174 --> 00:36:50,736
[SPEAKER_16]: What's... L-O-Z.

613
00:36:51,994 --> 00:36:54,316
[SPEAKER_16]: GQ, that's that magazine for men, right?

614
00:37:14,761 --> 00:37:16,823
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a little late, but hey, they're good.

615
00:37:18,044 --> 00:37:19,305
[SPEAKER_16]: You have a weak mind.

616
00:37:19,365 --> 00:37:20,946
[SPEAKER_16]: You've been sucked into the Harry Potter.

617
00:37:20,966 --> 00:37:23,088
[SPEAKER_10]: They're actually very good books.

618
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:24,469
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I know.

619
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:29,032
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember when the first book came out, and hardly anybody knew about the book.

620
00:37:29,993 --> 00:37:34,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Only my friend's little brother was reading it, and it started to get bigger and bigger, and I was like, what is this thing?

621
00:37:35,317 --> 00:37:42,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Then he had this Harry Potter birthday party, where all of his friends, they decorated the house like a Hogwarts house,

622
00:37:42,953 --> 00:37:46,314
[SPEAKER_10]: If you know what that is, I'm pretty sure most people know because it's in the movie.

623
00:37:46,614 --> 00:37:49,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, and I was just like, what is this?

624
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:50,056
[SPEAKER_10]: This is so stupid.

625
00:37:50,076 --> 00:37:56,558
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the time I know it, everybody's reading it, and I'm still skeptic about it, and the fourth book is out, and I'm just like, whatever.

626
00:37:57,038 --> 00:37:59,059
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Jamie, thank you Jamie, she buys...

627
00:38:00,043 --> 00:38:13,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Irene and I, the box set of the four books, the fifth book hasn't come out yet, and we had watched the first movie, and I really liked it, so, you know, we watched the second movie, I really liked it, and I finally got around to reading the books, and the books are so not kids' books.

628
00:38:14,306 --> 00:38:19,847
[SPEAKER_10]: They're geared towards kids, but I think there's a lot of things in the books that aren't, like, kids wouldn't even understand.

629
00:38:20,147 --> 00:38:23,368
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really, some of it's pretty complicated, so, good stuff.

630
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:27,049
[SPEAKER_10]: No, there's no hardcore sex, Loki.

631
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:27,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

632
00:38:28,942 --> 00:38:29,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, actually, I don't know.

633
00:38:29,743 --> 00:38:31,704
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't gotten all the way through the fourth book yet.

634
00:38:31,724 --> 00:38:33,606
[SPEAKER_10]: You're thinking of Harry Cooter, not Harry Potter.

635
00:38:33,726 --> 00:38:34,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Harry Cooter.

636
00:38:36,768 --> 00:38:39,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I haven't gotten all the way through the fourth or fifth book, so I don't know.

637
00:38:39,891 --> 00:38:45,996
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't say, but I'm sure there's a lot of people out there listening right now who have even read them all, so... Whatever.

638
00:38:46,136 --> 00:38:46,857
[SPEAKER_10]: No spoilers for me.

639
00:38:47,777 --> 00:38:53,122
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just wait until the movie comes out and you can see Harry Potter having sex with Hermione while Ron sticks him up the ass.

640
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:56,032
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

641
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,173
[SPEAKER_10]: With his wand.

642
00:38:57,253 --> 00:38:58,654
[SPEAKER_10]: You could probably download... Stick to his wand.

643
00:38:58,974 --> 00:39:01,735
[SPEAKER_16]: You could probably download that fanfic somewhere online.

644
00:39:01,755 --> 00:39:02,115
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

645
00:39:03,656 --> 00:39:05,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's ask... Jamie might know where it is.

646
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:06,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie knows where it is.

647
00:39:06,798 --> 00:39:07,918
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to get beat for that one.

648
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:09,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

649
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:16,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I have searched for pictures for the new movie coming out, the third movie, on Harry Potter.

650
00:39:16,463 --> 00:39:18,044
[SPEAKER_10]: And what comes up on Google Images?

651
00:39:19,784 --> 00:39:20,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Harry Potter doujinshis.

652
00:39:21,806 --> 00:39:24,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Which are like pornographic mangas.

653
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:35,482
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't even know why people bother.

654
00:39:35,502 --> 00:39:40,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see what Mario and Luigi look like when they're having anal sex.

655
00:39:41,584 --> 00:39:42,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that all you have to say, Brad?

656
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:43,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, pretty much.

657
00:39:43,824 --> 00:39:45,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, then let's ask Bradley.

658
00:39:45,485 --> 00:39:45,905
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your day?

659
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:46,345
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your week?

660
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:47,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, how's it going?

661
00:39:48,426 --> 00:39:48,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that Bradley.

662
00:39:50,484 --> 00:39:55,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Monday through Wednesday, I actually did some work for one place.

663
00:39:56,047 --> 00:40:01,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, I had a big stack of papers.

664
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:09,955
[SPEAKER_11]: One was in order and one was not, so I had to take one stack and reorder it to get it ready to put with the other papers so that we could stuff it in envelopes.

665
00:40:09,975 --> 00:40:11,476
[SPEAKER_16]: So you got paid to shuffle papers?

666
00:40:11,937 --> 00:40:14,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, shuffle papers and throw them in envelopes.

667
00:40:15,074 --> 00:40:15,274
[SPEAKER_11]: and so on.

668
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:37,031
[SPEAKER_11]: My cable got cut off because I haven't paid them yet for a while.

669
00:40:37,491 --> 00:40:39,973
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to die low for a while, which sucks.

670
00:40:40,734 --> 00:40:41,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Sucks majorly.

671
00:40:42,035 --> 00:40:47,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially if you need to have people calling sometime for maybe interviews or something.

672
00:40:47,939 --> 00:40:52,962
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have to keep it off during the day when I have to take everything.

673
00:40:53,002 --> 00:40:54,564
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of a bitch.

674
00:40:58,787 --> 00:41:00,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Saturday went around shopping and such.

675
00:41:02,694 --> 00:41:03,994
[SPEAKER_11]: and the limited money I have.

676
00:41:04,014 --> 00:41:05,775
[SPEAKER_11]: What'd you buy?

677
00:41:05,795 --> 00:41:07,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Just some detergent.

678
00:41:10,096 --> 00:41:11,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Day-to-day necessities.

679
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:14,937
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, because everybody out there listening to the show wants to know what kind of detergent you use.

680
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:16,497
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to know what kind of detergent you use.

681
00:41:17,037 --> 00:41:18,137
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought Cascade.

682
00:41:18,398 --> 00:41:18,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Cascade?

683
00:41:19,298 --> 00:41:19,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, wait, wait.

684
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:20,798
[SPEAKER_10]: For dishwasher detergent?

685
00:41:20,818 --> 00:41:21,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.

686
00:41:21,638 --> 00:41:27,240
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a... This will help everybody out there who has an apartment or house and actually has to do dishes.

687
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Do not buy

688
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:33,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Any name brand detergent for your fucking dishwasher.

689
00:41:34,637 --> 00:41:43,620
[SPEAKER_10]: I found out that Walmart brand Sam's Choice detergent from Walmart is better and cheaper than any other detergents out there.

690
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,501
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've used pretty much every freaking kind of dishwasher detergent.

691
00:41:47,221 --> 00:41:49,382
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to use Electrosol, Cascade.

692
00:41:49,742 --> 00:41:50,863
[SPEAKER_10]: It would not clean anything.

693
00:41:50,923 --> 00:41:55,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Even if I cleaned the dishes before I cleaned the dishes, it still did not clean them.

694
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,505
[SPEAKER_10]: But the Walmart, the Sam's Choice detergent

695
00:41:58,058 --> 00:41:58,919
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking kick ass.

696
00:41:59,299 --> 00:41:59,819
[SPEAKER_10]: It's cheap, too.

697
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, there's two hands grabbing for the mic.

698
00:42:02,982 --> 00:42:06,645
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the most uninteresting topic ever, but I'm actually interested here.

699
00:42:06,805 --> 00:42:12,629
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you just know this based upon experience, or do you have the scientific data to back it up?

700
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:13,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

701
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:13,290
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

702
00:42:13,866 --> 00:42:20,651
[SPEAKER_10]: I found the idea from, they did a news report on why can't they basically get, this is how boring our local news stations are.

703
00:42:21,192 --> 00:42:27,637
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't figure out, they do this will it work Wednesdays thing or whatever and they try to see like which, they compare products to see if they really work well.

704
00:42:27,937 --> 00:42:31,020
[SPEAKER_10]: And they were saying, you know, here's the expensive brands and they did like tests.

705
00:42:31,562 --> 00:42:39,507
[SPEAKER_10]: And now, I don't know if they made the fake tests or not, you know, but basically they said their opinion was to use this specific brand, this Walmart Sam's Choice brand.

706
00:42:39,888 --> 00:42:42,469
[SPEAKER_10]: And I mean, I don't know if they're faking the test or not, but I said, I'll give it a shot.

707
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:47,833
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have had nothing but bad results with other, I always thought it was my dishwasher that couldn't fucking wash the dishes.

708
00:42:48,353 --> 00:42:53,136
[SPEAKER_10]: But no, I go, I buy the Sam's Choice stuff, and it works better than any other kind of detergent I've ever used.

709
00:42:53,757 --> 00:42:56,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably because it has toxic substances in it, but who knows?

710
00:42:56,479 --> 00:42:56,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Who cares?

711
00:42:58,146 --> 00:42:59,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, good luck killing the Earth.

712
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,788
[SPEAKER_16]: Your dishes come out with a nice glow to them.

713
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:08,230
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for killing the Earth, Brad.

714
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:15,353
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, it's all... I'm single-handedly destroying this planet, and I feel good about it.

715
00:43:16,373 --> 00:43:19,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I can eat off a clean plate, so fuck you.

716
00:43:20,295 --> 00:43:21,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Even if my turkeys grow three eyes.

717
00:43:23,696 --> 00:43:25,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, turkeys, what are... I don't know, here.

718
00:43:27,068 --> 00:43:30,191
[SPEAKER_16]: If turkeys are growing extra limbs, that just means more food for me.

719
00:43:31,051 --> 00:43:32,052
[SPEAKER_13]: There's nothing wrong with that.

720
00:43:33,734 --> 00:43:35,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Supposedly, that's how KFC makes their chickens.

721
00:43:37,837 --> 00:43:43,141
[SPEAKER_10]: They have, like, no feathers, no beaks, huge bodies and tiny little legs.

722
00:43:43,382 --> 00:43:48,066
[SPEAKER_16]: KFC's doing something fucked up, because we all ate there the other day, and I swear to God, we were all like this afterwards.

723
00:43:48,086 --> 00:43:52,629
[SPEAKER_16]: We were all, like, clutching our stomachs, like, uh, chemical poisoning.

724
00:43:54,085 --> 00:43:54,906
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

725
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,840
[SPEAKER_16]: A factor for that.

726
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:16,282
[SPEAKER_16]: But, um, no, I think I was sick because I was, like, starving.

727
00:44:16,302 --> 00:44:22,365
[SPEAKER_16]: I hadn't eaten anything all day except for popcorn, a full thing of popcorn, and then I had a bunch of chicken.

728
00:44:22,746 --> 00:44:31,511
[SPEAKER_16]: And then later on that night, I had a, um, really hard, um, parmesan twist from Roundtable that were sitting out on the counter for three days.

729
00:44:32,171 --> 00:44:37,174
[SPEAKER_16]: And then after that, I'm all clenching my chest going, why am I not feeling good?

730
00:44:38,115 --> 00:44:38,295
[SPEAKER_13]: So...

731
00:44:39,881 --> 00:44:44,182
[SPEAKER_15]: Lesson for life, kids, don't start off the day with eating a bucket of popcorn.

732
00:44:44,402 --> 00:44:45,923
[SPEAKER_15]: It's never a good way to start.

733
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:48,284
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

734
00:44:50,624 --> 00:44:52,325
[SPEAKER_16]: Were you done talking about your day and your week, Bradley?

735
00:44:54,145 --> 00:44:56,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I didn't do all that much other than that.

736
00:44:57,106 --> 00:45:00,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Other than Wednesday coming over here and playing some DDR Extreme.

737
00:45:00,987 --> 00:45:03,448
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

738
00:45:04,248 --> 00:45:06,089
[SPEAKER_16]: I forgot to add one thing.

739
00:45:06,509 --> 00:45:06,629
[SPEAKER_16]: Hmm?

740
00:45:08,282 --> 00:45:14,946
[SPEAKER_16]: I forgot to add one thing about my week and my day, and that is that on yesterday morning, I went and saw Kill Bill for the third time.

741
00:45:15,066 --> 00:45:15,446
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

742
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:17,107
[SPEAKER_16]: Because, shut up!

743
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:18,608
[SPEAKER_16]: You were with me!

744
00:45:19,689 --> 00:45:20,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Screw you!

745
00:45:21,309 --> 00:45:24,691
[SPEAKER_16]: I know we missed the Pyramid tryouts because we had to go see Kill Bill again, so what can you do?

746
00:45:26,032 --> 00:45:30,274
[SPEAKER_16]: But Kill Bill was just as good the third time, and I will be going to see it at least a fourth time, if not fifth and sixth.

747
00:45:30,975 --> 00:45:31,915
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I'm sick.

748
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:36,758
[SPEAKER_16]: So, anyway, before we get to the break, I got over the chat room

749
00:45:37,782 --> 00:45:38,763
[SPEAKER_16]: A message from Jamie.

750
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:41,224
[SPEAKER_16]: She would like to share how her week and her day was.

751
00:45:41,744 --> 00:45:42,845
[SPEAKER_16]: So Jamie, how was your day?

752
00:45:42,905 --> 00:45:43,645
[SPEAKER_16]: How was your week?

753
00:45:44,546 --> 00:45:47,547
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, Jamie says, my week equals work.

754
00:45:48,348 --> 00:45:49,849
[SPEAKER_16]: My day equals suck.

755
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:53,330
[SPEAKER_16]: And no Bomani, because I'm being frugal.

756
00:45:56,192 --> 00:45:56,632
[SPEAKER_16]: There you go.

757
00:45:59,754 --> 00:46:00,014
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

758
00:46:01,237 --> 00:46:03,419
[SPEAKER_16]: If no one else has anything to say for right now, we're going to take a quick break.

759
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,703
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're going to come back and we're going to talk about DDR Extreme because we all got to play it this week.

760
00:46:07,763 --> 00:46:09,625
[SPEAKER_16]: And we certainly have a lot to say about it.

761
00:46:09,705 --> 00:46:11,666
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll get to that when we come back.

762
00:46:12,547 --> 00:46:13,928
[SPEAKER_16]: In the meantime, enjoy this break.

763
00:46:14,008 --> 00:46:19,673
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll have some Casey and the Sunshine Band from X2USA all the way to Sean the Horny Master.

764
00:46:20,073 --> 00:46:20,514
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be back.

765
00:51:28,755 --> 00:51:37,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

766
00:51:37,421 --> 00:51:43,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

767
00:51:43,805 --> 00:51:44,926
[SPEAKER_16]: Howdy, folks.

768
00:51:45,026 --> 00:51:45,447
[SPEAKER_16]: We're back.

769
00:51:45,487 --> 00:51:47,848
[SPEAKER_16]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 65.

770
00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:52,571
[SPEAKER_16]: The sick episode, because Jamie's out sick tonight.

771
00:51:54,093 --> 00:51:55,574
[SPEAKER_16]: She would have tried to really...

772
00:51:56,932 --> 00:51:58,513
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

773
00:52:26,707 --> 00:52:28,587
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

774
00:52:54,389 --> 00:52:56,230
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, you're looking through the peephole, Loki, huh?

775
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:57,710
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you see?

776
00:52:58,410 --> 00:52:59,431
[SPEAKER_16]: Are there naked people out there?

777
00:53:02,431 --> 00:53:02,872
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, just Brad.

778
00:53:03,252 --> 00:53:03,992
[SPEAKER_16]: Damn my phone!

779
00:53:07,173 --> 00:53:08,133
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, is Brad talking to the neighbors?

780
00:53:08,973 --> 00:53:17,116
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we have some interesting neighbors, because our neighbors upstairs to the left, they're big anime fans, so they think what we do is pretty funny.

781
00:53:17,556 --> 00:53:20,917
[SPEAKER_16]: They like to make fun of Loki and his DDR pads that he's building outside.

782
00:53:23,577 --> 00:53:24,137
[SPEAKER_16]: What did they say?

783
00:53:25,258 --> 00:53:32,121
[SPEAKER_16]: I was commenting to them the other day about how Loki's building his machine, and I commented something like, oh yeah, they asked me, where are you going to put it?

784
00:53:32,502 --> 00:53:37,644
[SPEAKER_16]: And I said, oh well, Loki's going to get rid of the TV and kind of put it in its place, because the cabinet's going to be a television too.

785
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:42,967
[SPEAKER_16]: And they were kind of like, oh, there's nothing like watching Loki playing some DDR.

786
00:53:45,069 --> 00:53:46,870
[SPEAKER_16]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

787
00:54:11,465 --> 00:54:12,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck, I missed something.

788
00:54:12,446 --> 00:54:15,588
[SPEAKER_10]: They're talking in the chatroom about your neighbors are on drugs.

789
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:19,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, because I just talked to your neighbors out there.

790
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:19,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

791
00:54:19,831 --> 00:54:20,392
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll tell you later.

792
00:54:20,672 --> 00:54:21,292
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll talk about it later.

793
00:54:21,372 --> 00:54:21,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

794
00:54:23,014 --> 00:54:23,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Extreme.

795
00:54:23,954 --> 00:54:25,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Sucks.

796
00:54:27,177 --> 00:54:28,317
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't really care for Extreme.

797
00:54:28,337 --> 00:54:31,440
[SPEAKER_10]: The last machine I was really ever excited about was Max 2.

798
00:54:32,961 --> 00:54:39,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Extreme came out in the arcade and I thought it was really cool they put Sakura in there and Zenon and Daikin Kai and

799
00:54:41,097 --> 00:54:46,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Miracle Moon, LED Style, like, those were a few good songs, but the most of the songs in the machine sucked.

800
00:54:47,061 --> 00:54:58,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, now, the home version comes out, and I hear, you know, the songs that are gonna be out on it, the unlocks, I heard them pretty much before, like, I got to, yeah, I heard them before I got to play the game.

801
00:54:58,608 --> 00:55:01,870
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to play the game, the steps on all of them pretty much suck.

802
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:05,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people will disagree with me, saying, like, Scorching Moon steps are cool, I think...

803
00:55:06,448 --> 00:55:10,932
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, I think they're being really non-innovative with their steps still, and I mean, there's only so much you can do.

804
00:55:12,613 --> 00:55:18,718
[SPEAKER_10]: There's only so much you can do, but still, like, they gave them all easy difficulties except for Max period, but we can talk about that later.

805
00:55:19,459 --> 00:55:22,321
[SPEAKER_16]: Hasn't Konami kind of been doing that with all the new songs lately?

806
00:55:22,341 --> 00:55:25,684
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, people were bitching about Max 2 USA kind of had shitty steps too.

807
00:55:26,485 --> 00:55:28,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's because those steps are made in Hawaii, I believe.

808
00:55:28,848 --> 00:55:30,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Konami Hawaii makes those steps.

809
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:31,551
[SPEAKER_16]: This is from what I understand.

810
00:55:31,591 --> 00:55:33,874
[SPEAKER_16]: Konami Hawaii does everything about the Xbox.

811
00:55:33,894 --> 00:55:35,375
[SPEAKER_16]: This is just how I understand it.

812
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,036
[SPEAKER_16]: I could be wrong.

813
00:55:36,377 --> 00:55:41,122
[SPEAKER_16]: From what I picked up, Konami Hawaii only does everything relating to the Xbox game, and I mean everything.

814
00:55:41,262 --> 00:55:44,386
[SPEAKER_16]: Konami Hawaii has completely developed the Xbox and computer versions of DDR.

815
00:55:46,297 --> 00:55:50,599
[SPEAKER_16]: There's kind of a debate whether Konami USA is making those steps or Konami Japan.

816
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:54,001
[SPEAKER_16]: Some people think it's being done in the U.S., some people say it's Japan.

817
00:55:54,161 --> 00:55:55,001
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess people don't really know.

818
00:55:55,021 --> 00:55:55,942
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a different style.

819
00:55:56,002 --> 00:56:02,585
[SPEAKER_10]: There's obviously a different style to the steps on the American-only songs that don't show up in other Japanese games, you know.

820
00:56:03,025 --> 00:56:06,887
[SPEAKER_10]: I can tell there's some sort of difference to them, so I'm thinking they're done by somebody else.

821
00:56:07,647 --> 00:56:11,569
[SPEAKER_10]: But still, the thing is... What was I going to say?

822
00:56:13,004 --> 00:56:15,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I'm getting sidetracked by some of the stuff that's being talked about.

823
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:16,566
[SPEAKER_10]: Then don't look at the chatroom.

824
00:56:16,586 --> 00:56:17,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at it when you're done talking.

825
00:56:17,306 --> 00:56:19,788
[SPEAKER_10]: There's important stuff I want to talk about that they keep talking about.

826
00:56:19,808 --> 00:56:20,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, alright.

827
00:56:20,888 --> 00:56:21,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, I'll get back to that later.

828
00:56:22,329 --> 00:56:25,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, um... Shoot.

829
00:56:25,551 --> 00:56:28,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, yeah, the steps for these new Unlocked songs were kind of ass.

830
00:56:30,174 --> 00:56:32,215
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Scorching Moon.

831
00:56:32,675 --> 00:56:38,618
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I pretty much like all of the Unlocked songs on Xtreme except for Max Period, which, what, leaves three songs?

832
00:56:39,178 --> 00:56:41,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Undo Toi, Scorching Moon, and Stupid Barber.

833
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:41,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much.

834
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:48,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Those were all good songs, and it was pretty much up to how the steps felt, and the steps didn't feel right.

835
00:56:48,845 --> 00:56:51,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Max Period was an extreme disappointment.

836
00:56:51,487 --> 00:56:56,471
[SPEAKER_10]: In my opinion, it seems like they hired Bomani Ruler to make a step file for Max Period.

837
00:56:57,752 --> 00:56:58,333
[SPEAKER_10]: And they didn't.

838
00:56:58,413 --> 00:56:59,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't start that rumor.

839
00:56:59,634 --> 00:57:00,234
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I know.

840
00:57:00,254 --> 00:57:01,515
[SPEAKER_10]: That rumor's already going around.

841
00:57:01,535 --> 00:57:06,899
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, but you look at it, and it's just like, okay, let's speed up the fucking BPM to 800 BPM or whatever it is at the very end.

842
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:07,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

843
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:07,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

844
00:57:08,803 --> 00:57:09,543
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fun.

845
00:57:10,444 --> 00:57:11,905
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they've totally jumped the shark.

846
00:57:12,245 --> 00:57:13,866
[SPEAKER_15]: No, here's what they did.

847
00:57:14,906 --> 00:57:16,627
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't really know what we want.

848
00:57:17,528 --> 00:57:20,269
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why DDR Extreme was, what songs do you want?

849
00:57:20,369 --> 00:57:24,371
[SPEAKER_16]: Notice all the songs that they picked, a lot of them, were sim files beforehand.

850
00:57:24,891 --> 00:57:25,832
[SPEAKER_15]: So, think about it.

851
00:57:26,672 --> 00:57:29,614
[SPEAKER_15]: If I'm going to find out what people want as a sim file...

852
00:57:30,274 --> 00:57:34,637
[SPEAKER_15]: or not a sim file, but a steps for Max and what I want the song.

853
00:57:34,957 --> 00:57:38,039
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to go listen to all the sim files and mix songs.

854
00:57:38,379 --> 00:57:41,440
[SPEAKER_16]: Notice... Wait, wait, you're talking about Max 2 USA, not Extreme, right?

855
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:46,083
[SPEAKER_16]: Because you're talking about like Heaven had like 50 sim files for it and then... No, no, no, no, no.

856
00:57:46,143 --> 00:57:47,284
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm talking about Extreme.

857
00:57:47,604 --> 00:57:48,685
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking Extreme here.

858
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:49,405
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

859
00:57:49,425 --> 00:57:50,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, because look.

860
00:57:50,906 --> 00:57:53,807
[SPEAKER_16]: Colors, A, V, those all have steps.

861
00:57:53,868 --> 00:57:55,388
[SPEAKER_16]: I see what you're talking about.

862
00:57:55,528 --> 00:57:55,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

863
00:57:55,789 --> 00:57:57,309
[SPEAKER_16]: Now look at Max period.

864
00:57:57,730 --> 00:57:58,530
[SPEAKER_16]: It's basically...

865
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:03,115
[SPEAKER_16]: I could basically make that stupid song, okay?

866
00:58:03,215 --> 00:58:04,276
[SPEAKER_16]: That song... It was very basic.

867
00:58:04,296 --> 00:58:06,378
[SPEAKER_16]: It wasn't remixed at all, very much.

868
00:58:06,919 --> 00:58:10,102
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um... Why do you need Komi in an original song?

869
00:58:10,163 --> 00:58:13,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, and the step charts to it, it's a bunch of jumping.

870
00:58:13,446 --> 00:58:13,847
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just...

871
00:58:14,582 --> 00:58:15,703
[SPEAKER_15]: It was fucking retarded.

872
00:58:16,223 --> 00:58:19,626
[SPEAKER_15]: So, how are most of the Max step charts and songs?

873
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:20,426
[SPEAKER_15]: They suck.

874
00:58:20,746 --> 00:58:24,529
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I guess they think that we like this kind of step charts, so that's what they gave us.

875
00:58:24,689 --> 00:58:26,751
[SPEAKER_10]: I really liked the steps for Max 300.

876
00:58:26,791 --> 00:58:28,632
[SPEAKER_10]: I think those were really good for the song.

877
00:58:28,912 --> 00:58:30,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Max Unlimited, pretty good.

878
00:58:30,994 --> 00:58:32,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of jumps, but still pretty good.

879
00:58:32,975 --> 00:58:34,036
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it just started going downhill.

880
00:58:34,416 --> 00:58:37,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Legend of the Max, alright, but just, I don't know.

881
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:40,540
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it should have ended there, just with Max 300 and Max Unlimited.

882
00:58:40,621 --> 00:58:42,222
[SPEAKER_10]: And the steps just start, you know...

883
00:58:43,242 --> 00:58:46,864
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess there's just only so much they can do with the steps before they run out of ideas.

884
00:58:48,005 --> 00:58:50,066
[SPEAKER_16]: It's interesting that you guys keep saying there's only so much they can do.

885
00:58:50,106 --> 00:58:51,006
[SPEAKER_16]: There's only so much they can do.

886
00:58:51,026 --> 00:58:52,627
[SPEAKER_16]: There's only so much they can do because I think they're done.

887
00:58:53,528 --> 00:58:57,630
[SPEAKER_16]: Because DDR Extreme has a credits mode on it, and in this credits mode...

888
00:58:58,343 --> 00:59:00,866
[SPEAKER_16]: It's very epilogue-ish in the way it's presented.

889
00:59:00,926 --> 00:59:02,608
[SPEAKER_16]: It kind of goes through the history of DDR.

890
00:59:02,628 --> 00:59:05,792
[SPEAKER_16]: Like it shows DDR first mix was then, and DDR second mix was then.

891
00:59:05,832 --> 00:59:06,793
[SPEAKER_16]: It shows little screenshots and stuff.

892
00:59:07,273 --> 00:59:10,057
[SPEAKER_16]: And then they're pretty much giving you the impression that that's it.

893
00:59:10,257 --> 00:59:10,637
[SPEAKER_16]: We're done.

894
00:59:10,757 --> 00:59:11,839
[SPEAKER_16]: No more DDR.

895
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:13,801
[SPEAKER_16]: Although I don't think that's the case.

896
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:16,003
[SPEAKER_16]: I think DDR is going to come back, but it's going to be a...

897
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:18,924
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be different.

898
00:59:19,004 --> 00:59:21,565
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be different, like how Beatmania 2DX is different than Beatmania.

899
00:59:21,585 --> 00:59:46,682
[SPEAKER_16]: And to further reinforce that, they have, in each mix that's released, there's a master song list that includes all the songs that they're working on for other mixes that have not been released yet, and DDR Extreme has the same track list as DDR Max USA 2, which pretty much, it's just, all that's left on that song list is just the Ultra Mix, and that's it.

900
00:59:48,363 --> 00:59:55,391
[SPEAKER_16]: But obviously we know the European, I mean they're still developing for Europeans market, you know, and they're also developing for our market.

901
00:59:55,531 --> 00:59:59,815
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I mean I'm sure you'll see more stuff, it's just we'll only be in the US.

902
01:00:00,436 --> 01:00:06,522
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'll see, I mean once the stupid party collection comes out, there might be some more stuff on there, you never know.

903
01:00:08,144 --> 01:00:08,284
[SPEAKER_16]: So.

904
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:12,505
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that's true, because there's still the Party Edition coming out.

905
01:00:12,565 --> 01:00:15,307
[SPEAKER_16]: Party Collection, and you never know, it might be like preview for something.

906
01:00:15,467 --> 01:00:22,712
[SPEAKER_16]: Although, I seem to think that it's kind of weird that Party Collection is kind of coming out after DDR has kind of already had its epilogue here.

907
01:00:23,532 --> 01:00:26,675
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't know what DDR Party Collection is going to be.

908
01:00:26,735 --> 01:00:28,996
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm hoping that maybe there'll be some kind of hint for the new DDR.

909
01:00:29,016 --> 01:00:32,819
[SPEAKER_16]: I wouldn't read too much into that cred screen, because they're just talking about what came out so far.

910
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,120
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of like a thank you to them.

911
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:34,220
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm...

912
01:00:35,607 --> 01:00:36,287
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know about you guys.

913
01:00:36,307 --> 01:00:46,636
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you guys see the credit sequence at all, or did you guys kind of, even from Max Period, even just the Max Period, thank you for playing the way it claps at the end and it's like a finale type thing, more of like an encore kind of song.

914
01:00:48,437 --> 01:00:50,139
[SPEAKER_16]: Then again, that song sucked.

915
01:00:50,479 --> 01:00:51,860
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it did suck.

916
01:00:52,341 --> 01:00:53,542
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll give you that, but you know.

917
01:00:55,342 --> 01:01:01,085
[SPEAKER_16]: The whole thing is it comes back down to what they put on that stupid header for Extreme.

918
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:02,005
[SPEAKER_16]: We're starting over.

919
01:01:02,905 --> 01:01:04,986
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't start over if you're going to end it right there.

920
01:01:05,306 --> 01:01:07,347
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, that's kind of retarded right there.

921
01:01:08,288 --> 01:01:10,649
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, obviously they're going to do something with it.

922
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:12,689
[SPEAKER_13]: They didn't say, this is the last one.

923
01:01:12,789 --> 01:01:14,990
[SPEAKER_13]: This is, you know, it ends here.

924
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:18,552
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the final revolution or something like that, you know.

925
01:01:19,252 --> 01:01:21,573
[SPEAKER_16]: They would definitely advertise it like that if it was the last one.

926
01:01:21,613 --> 01:01:23,774
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think they're just going to be like, eh, whatever.

927
01:01:26,161 --> 01:01:29,225
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, there's still plenty of stuff that they haven't even tried yet.

928
01:01:29,265 --> 01:01:36,993
[SPEAKER_15]: They haven't tried, like, doing songs with unlocks that have to do with the emall cards and stuff like that, and I'm sure there's a new machine coming.

929
01:01:37,654 --> 01:01:41,819
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just a new type of machine that they're still developing that's probably a little ways away.

930
01:01:43,996 --> 01:01:47,337
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's what's going to be interesting.

931
01:01:47,417 --> 01:01:54,860
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very confident that we're going to see DDR Extreme in the U.S., a home version of DDR Extreme.

932
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,261
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very confident that we're going to have that.

933
01:01:57,161 --> 01:01:58,642
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be interesting to see if the U.S.

934
01:01:58,682 --> 01:02:03,243
[SPEAKER_16]: kind of treats it as the last mix or what they're going to do, because as far as I can tell, DDR in the U.S.

935
01:02:03,323 --> 01:02:04,904
[SPEAKER_16]: is still mega popular.

936
01:02:05,184 --> 01:02:09,206
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I was listening to Under Station Live on Friday night, the radio show that

937
01:02:10,524 --> 01:02:12,925
[SPEAKER_16]: I started on that's still on Live365 if you want to catch it.

938
01:02:13,325 --> 01:02:30,932
[SPEAKER_16]: I was listening to Under Station Live, and the host there works for one of those discount stores, one of those big discount stores, and they're getting, like, huge shipment of dance pads in now, which shows, like, you know, well, maybe it's that, oh, the dance pads aren't selling, so they're having to be relegated to discount stores, but that more shows to me that DDR is, like, everywhere.

939
01:02:30,952 --> 01:02:32,473
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what I mean?

940
01:02:33,653 --> 01:02:36,034
[SPEAKER_16]: It's still growing in the U.S., from what I see.

941
01:02:37,526 --> 01:02:51,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like always, in Japanese games that are produced, directed, and created in Japan, we always get them, you know, whatever the latest thing is in Japan, we get them either a few months to a year or years behind them.

942
01:02:51,994 --> 01:02:58,657
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, it's just starting to get, I mean, even though there were American machines three years ago, with the 1.5, you know,

943
01:03:00,138 --> 01:03:17,010
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't still take off nearly as much as it's going to start with, these home versions, because people who don't have the... A lot of people out there see it as, oh, this is a good way to get an exercise, but they don't want to go up and make a fool of themselves on the American machines out there in the arcades, or some of the import machines.

944
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:19,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Now they're like, okay, I can buy it and play it in my own home.

945
01:03:19,632 --> 01:03:21,513
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's starting to get popular.

946
01:03:21,553 --> 01:03:22,214
[SPEAKER_10]: People are starting to...

947
01:03:22,914 --> 01:03:32,023
[SPEAKER_10]: See, and I think, yeah, there is still a life for DDR, you know, a market for DDR in America, but I don't see there being much more of a market for music games in general.

948
01:03:32,043 --> 01:03:35,066
[SPEAKER_10]: In the next two years, I think we're going to find out where music games are going.

949
01:03:36,287 --> 01:03:36,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Ending, or...

950
01:03:37,691 --> 01:04:04,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Whether or not it's going to go much longer Because a lot of other companies are doing Namco has a line of music games They've got Taiko no Tatsujin You know, there's a lot of other companies out there that are doing Enix has been doing the Bust a Move series Even though that's pretty much done with Music games are going to die out very soon So it's not surprising that the latest versions of DDR are kind of just sucking I think they're just going to start I think they're going to start...

951
01:04:06,332 --> 01:04:08,393
[SPEAKER_10]: You can tell by where their money's going with games.

952
01:04:08,433 --> 01:04:11,495
[SPEAKER_10]: The big, big titles that come on me are putting out like this New Castlevania.

953
01:04:11,736 --> 01:04:20,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, they're taking their money away from their Bomani series, and they're putting it towards something else that people are going to... might last longer.

954
01:04:20,521 --> 01:04:20,821
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

955
01:04:21,061 --> 01:04:21,742
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just my opinion.

956
01:04:23,803 --> 01:04:25,344
[SPEAKER_16]: I think you're wrong on one thing.

957
01:04:25,364 --> 01:04:26,964
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think the music games are dying.

958
01:04:27,024 --> 01:04:29,284
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they're changing.

959
01:04:29,885 --> 01:04:32,705
[SPEAKER_16]: As the systems get bigger and better, I think the music games are changing too.

960
01:04:32,765 --> 01:04:34,906
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's why we have this new line of games coming out.

961
01:04:34,926 --> 01:04:36,186
[SPEAKER_16]: We have the karaoke revolution.

962
01:04:36,686 --> 01:04:42,608
[SPEAKER_16]: They say karaoke is going to be the next big music game because you've got American Idol, the game as well, which isn't really karaoke.

963
01:04:42,648 --> 01:04:43,208
[SPEAKER_16]: It's more crap.

964
01:04:44,469 --> 01:04:48,795
[SPEAKER_15]: The thing I was thinking of, though, is look at DDR itself as an arcade machine.

965
01:04:49,076 --> 01:04:51,479
[SPEAKER_15]: It's running on hardware that's a good 10 years old.

966
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:52,881
[SPEAKER_16]: That's true.

967
01:04:52,941 --> 01:04:57,888
[SPEAKER_16]: It's running on... Well, not about 10 years old, but it's pretty damn old.

968
01:04:58,109 --> 01:04:58,289
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, 98.

969
01:04:58,389 --> 01:05:00,192
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like a good 6 years old right now.

970
01:05:01,378 --> 01:05:02,599
[SPEAKER_16]: It's due for an update.

971
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:11,726
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it's so old right now, they can't do anything else with this, so they can't release another game on there because it will just be inferior.

972
01:05:11,987 --> 01:05:13,147
[SPEAKER_15]: They can't possibly do it.

973
01:05:13,448 --> 01:05:16,850
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why they're coming up with a new hardware system for it.

974
01:05:17,191 --> 01:05:25,337
[SPEAKER_16]: It would make sense that they're shifting their money away from it right now, and they're kind of hurrying through some of these things, because maybe they're just trying new stuff right now with the hardware.

975
01:05:25,637 --> 01:05:26,098
[SPEAKER_16]: They're trying to...

976
01:05:27,699 --> 01:05:33,241
[SPEAKER_16]: I would love to see, to make DDR more interactive, love to see them bring out another, like a substream type mix, but have it a little more interactive, where...

977
01:05:48,047 --> 01:06:10,252
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got a newer version of Beatmania 2DX and a newer version of, or just whatever Beatmania machine they want to link to it, I would hope it'd be 2DX, with a DDR, a newer version of that, and let's say, you know, you play, somebody's playing 2DX, you don't have to have them linked, but if you want to have them linked, one person on 2DX will be playing the song, like DJing, so you've got more interaction, you've got like a person who's DJing and a person who's dancing.

978
01:06:10,572 --> 01:06:15,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Then, depending on how good the person playing 2DX, DJing, quote unquote, is doing, you

979
01:06:16,388 --> 01:06:16,988
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Loki,

980
01:06:38,414 --> 01:06:41,376
[SPEAKER_10]: It changes the way the steps turn out in the end of the song.

981
01:06:41,836 --> 01:06:45,538
[SPEAKER_10]: So like if you miss a certain step, it goes ahead and makes the song a little easier near the end.

982
01:06:45,578 --> 01:06:52,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas if you start doing really good, and you keep doing better and better, and you're hitting all the steps, the song kind of morphs and it upgrades.

983
01:06:52,242 --> 01:06:54,704
[SPEAKER_10]: It becomes a harder song with a different type of ending.

984
01:06:55,336 --> 01:06:55,956
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

985
01:07:22,242 --> 01:07:23,783
[SPEAKER_16]: One arcade in the whole nation would have it.

986
01:07:24,464 --> 01:07:25,505
[SPEAKER_10]: That's arcade infinity.

987
01:07:25,525 --> 01:07:30,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Not if they put in the effort to produce many of them and really advertise it.

988
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:33,011
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be so expensive.

989
01:07:33,672 --> 01:07:35,013
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be so expensive.

990
01:07:35,033 --> 01:07:41,138
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think any... The interesting thing about DDR is as expensive as it is, you can still find it at your local bowling alley.

991
01:07:41,779 --> 01:07:45,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, okay, I'm not thinking in the interest of us Americans.

992
01:07:46,782 --> 01:07:55,046
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking of in the Japanese market because I'm not going to be one of those people who sits there and complains, why don't we get these cool Japanese games in America?

993
01:07:55,126 --> 01:07:57,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they're not made for us in America.

994
01:07:58,027 --> 01:08:02,869
[SPEAKER_10]: The American companies will want to bring them over when they think we're ready for them or if there is a market.

995
01:08:03,189 --> 01:08:05,570
[SPEAKER_10]: They're made in Japan for the Japanese market.

996
01:08:06,977 --> 01:08:13,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, on top of that, I'm thinking, for their interest, they have a lot of DDR machines and a lot of 2DX machines in Japan.

997
01:08:13,701 --> 01:08:18,905
[SPEAKER_10]: They could just have a hardware upgrade, including, like, a network adapter that could link these machines.

998
01:08:19,505 --> 01:08:29,552
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, making new machines, of course, would be hell of expensive, but for them to just do... I mean, the hardware upgrade from 8th style to 9th style 2DX was a pretty big upgrade.

999
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:33,795
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's all hard drive, it's all computer now, running an OS of, I believe, Windows XP.

1000
01:08:34,631 --> 01:08:44,317
[SPEAKER_10]: So they obviously can do it, and they can keep it somehow money, economic, a good economic decision.

1001
01:08:44,337 --> 01:08:45,598
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it can be done.

1002
01:08:47,019 --> 01:08:47,359
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1003
01:08:47,500 --> 01:09:01,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think that, like I believe, because I heard a few years ago the rumor was that Konami's been getting some bad flack, you know, or some bad results with their music series because of all the other companies bringing out other music games.

1004
01:09:02,714 --> 01:09:18,287
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's... If you have to admit, after Max 2 came out, I think all the rest of their music games have just been like... It may just be me, but nobody I know except the hardcore players are interested in Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania anymore.

1005
01:09:18,667 --> 01:09:20,069
[SPEAKER_16]: Yet the mixes keep coming out.

1006
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:20,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's right.

1007
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:22,751
[SPEAKER_16]: And poppin' music keeps coming out.

1008
01:09:22,771 --> 01:09:25,013
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody cares about... Like, Guitar Freaks is just...

1009
01:09:25,633 --> 01:09:31,916
[SPEAKER_16]: I love the game, but you have to look past the fact that it's been beaten into the ground.

1010
01:09:31,936 --> 01:09:35,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, well, you make a point, because people are going to get pissed off and say, hey, I love Guitar Freaks Drum Mania.

1011
01:09:55,174 --> 01:09:59,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Get past the fact that you love the game and the idea of the game and look at the quality of the music on it.

1012
01:10:00,217 --> 01:10:05,800
[SPEAKER_10]: The quality of the music has gone down since, like, 5th Mix, Drum Mania, at least that I can think of, because that was the first machine we got.

1013
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,121
[SPEAKER_10]: No, actually, no, we got 5th Mix, Guitar Freak, sorry.

1014
01:10:09,602 --> 01:10:13,384
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there were a lot of songs on there that I would play constantly.

1015
01:10:13,404 --> 01:10:21,489
[SPEAKER_10]: I pretty much always had something fresh to play, but when I go and I try to play Guitar Freak's 8th Mix, I think we have, there's probably, like, five songs I'll play.

1016
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:25,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there are some good old songs that came, but I think I played them to death.

1017
01:10:25,812 --> 01:10:29,735
[SPEAKER_10]: And then as far as the new songs is concerned, it's just like there's not very many good new songs.

1018
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:34,079
[SPEAKER_16]: So the series has kind of been... I was just in Milpitas Golf Land not too long ago.

1019
01:10:34,119 --> 01:10:36,380
[SPEAKER_16]: I was there for Chubb's birthday party a couple weeks ago.

1020
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:38,362
[SPEAKER_16]: And they have Guitar Freaks.

1021
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:39,443
[SPEAKER_16]: It's either 9 or 10.

1022
01:10:39,503 --> 01:10:40,183
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what it was.

1023
01:10:40,584 --> 01:10:47,009
[SPEAKER_16]: But I walked by it at one point, and it was completely empty, and I had no interest in putting the dollar in and playing, even though I'd never even played it yet.

1024
01:10:47,589 --> 01:10:49,851
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I haven't played it, so I think I'd try it out, but still...

1025
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,623
[SPEAKER_16]: I played the Guitar Freaks 10, I think, or 9.

1026
01:10:56,384 --> 01:10:57,145
[SPEAKER_16]: It was, yeah, it was 9.

1027
01:10:57,205 --> 01:10:58,726
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't even know if it's 9 or 10.

1028
01:10:58,786 --> 01:11:00,728
[SPEAKER_16]: 10 just came out, I think.

1029
01:11:00,869 --> 01:11:01,509
[SPEAKER_16]: 10's just coming out.

1030
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:02,710
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was Guitar Freaks 9.

1031
01:11:03,171 --> 01:11:06,635
[SPEAKER_16]: I played that at Phantom of Khan once, and I was like, eh.

1032
01:11:07,455 --> 01:11:08,617
[SPEAKER_16]: After that, didn't even care.

1033
01:11:09,277 --> 01:11:12,681
[SPEAKER_16]: Played it like maybe one or two times, and I was done.

1034
01:11:13,161 --> 01:11:13,922
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1035
01:11:30,507 --> 01:11:36,650
[SPEAKER_16]: Unlocked, you know, all three new songs, which was like, whoop-a-dee-doo, and then I was done.

1036
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:39,491
[SPEAKER_16]: I was done playing the game, I just didn't care no more.

1037
01:11:39,791 --> 01:11:43,073
[SPEAKER_16]: Because, you know, I played the rest of these songs to death in the arcade.

1038
01:11:46,154 --> 01:11:51,777
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, I will always like Drum Mania, because I personally, I love drum music.

1039
01:11:52,281 --> 01:11:52,762
[SPEAKER_10]: www.darksakura.com

1040
01:12:04,065 --> 01:12:07,669
[SPEAKER_10]: And even when we have Drum Mania, it's broken a lot, you know, constantly.

1041
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:10,192
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I can't speak for it.

1042
01:12:10,212 --> 01:12:14,196
[SPEAKER_10]: If I go down to M. Milpitas and get to play their Drum Mania 8th mix, then maybe I'll like it.

1043
01:12:14,236 --> 01:12:15,578
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't really speak for it right now.

1044
01:12:16,579 --> 01:12:22,606
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate to put you on the spot, Bradley, but I'm curious, because I know you're a big fan of Guitar Freaks, because you're always asking me to play the music from it.

1045
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:25,229
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you think about this whole conversation?

1046
01:12:28,101 --> 01:12:32,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Eh, well, I haven't played Ninth because I haven't been in the medias in like six months.

1047
01:12:34,506 --> 01:12:35,147
[SPEAKER_11]: I still like it.

1048
01:12:35,387 --> 01:12:43,854
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually haven't really heard the music from Ninth because I maybe listened to it once and haven't listened to it since.

1049
01:12:43,914 --> 01:12:48,298
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can't really say anything about the quality, but I still enjoy it.

1050
01:12:49,659 --> 01:12:50,800
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really all I can say at the moment.

1051
01:12:51,961 --> 01:12:51,981
[SPEAKER_10]: I...

1052
01:12:53,072 --> 01:12:59,076
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to say I am looking forward to Marmalade, Potpourri de Marmalade on, I think it's like Guitar Freaks 10.

1053
01:12:59,957 --> 01:13:08,602
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, if they're not doing any more DDR, you would think all the artists that do the originals for DDR will now, you know, go to some other games and make some good originals for that.

1054
01:13:09,403 --> 01:13:12,104
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, of course, I don't know what fucking game Soda could do.

1055
01:13:12,465 --> 01:13:14,886
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I guess he'll go to 2DX or something.

1056
01:13:15,326 --> 01:13:18,428
[SPEAKER_16]: Although, you know, it's debatable if 2DX has as much life left as well.

1057
01:13:18,448 --> 01:13:18,508
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

1058
01:13:21,866 --> 01:13:22,326
[SPEAKER_16]: Who knows?

1059
01:13:23,727 --> 01:13:25,568
[SPEAKER_16]: Who knows where all that's going?

1060
01:13:26,508 --> 01:13:26,768
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1061
01:13:26,828 --> 01:13:29,590
[SPEAKER_16]: It's hard to make a prediction.

1062
01:13:29,650 --> 01:13:30,370
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll just have to see.

1063
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:32,231
[SPEAKER_16]: Was there anything you saw in the chat room you want to comment on?

1064
01:13:32,411 --> 01:13:34,152
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you saw some stuff earlier that made you go on.

1065
01:13:34,172 --> 01:13:35,092
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a completely different topic.

1066
01:13:35,132 --> 01:13:36,453
[SPEAKER_10]: It'd be kind of weird to change topics right now.

1067
01:13:36,493 --> 01:13:36,973
[SPEAKER_10]: That's alright.

1068
01:13:37,133 --> 01:13:38,714
[SPEAKER_10]: But I want to say something real quick.

1069
01:13:39,554 --> 01:13:41,095
[SPEAKER_10]: In case your neighbors are listening now.

1070
01:13:42,356 --> 01:13:42,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they really?

1071
01:13:44,076 --> 01:13:49,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, your neighbors walked by and they were saying, so, do you still do the show?

1072
01:13:49,898 --> 01:13:50,558
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said, yes.

1073
01:13:50,678 --> 01:13:53,339
[SPEAKER_10]: And they asked, what is it called and how do they get to it?

1074
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:59,440
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I basically said, live 365, search for Orange Lounge and check it out because the page isn't updated really yet.

1075
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:00,860
[SPEAKER_10]: It needs to be updated, the web page.

1076
01:14:01,861 --> 01:14:04,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it does need an update.

1077
01:14:04,241 --> 01:14:04,942
[SPEAKER_10]: He's funny, though.

1078
01:14:05,102 --> 01:14:07,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Your neighbor said he could listen to it.

1079
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:09,243
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got broadband, so he could listen to it.

1080
01:14:09,323 --> 01:14:10,363
[SPEAKER_10]: And then he could, like, I don't know,

1081
01:14:11,855 --> 01:14:16,379
[SPEAKER_10]: respond to something you say in the chat room and then come running downstairs, knock on your door and go, hey, did you get that?

1082
01:14:16,939 --> 01:14:17,299
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1083
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:24,125
[SPEAKER_16]: He could, theoretically with the buffer, one of them could run downstairs, yell something in the microphone, then run upstairs and hear themselves.

1084
01:14:24,145 --> 01:14:25,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, exactly, exactly.

1085
01:14:25,285 --> 01:14:26,887
[SPEAKER_16]: With the buffer, they could hear themselves say it.

1086
01:14:28,168 --> 01:14:30,690
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I think we've, I've done that in one way or another.

1087
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:34,493
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't remember what it was, but I remember like yelling something in it and then going off to hear it somewhere else.

1088
01:14:34,513 --> 01:14:37,735
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it was when we were doing a remote broadcast for one of the tournaments or something.

1089
01:14:37,935 --> 01:14:38,836
[SPEAKER_16]: That's great.

1090
01:14:40,122 --> 01:14:41,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, come say hello if you're listening.

1091
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:42,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, if neighbors are listening.

1092
01:14:42,746 --> 01:14:43,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, neighbors.

1093
01:14:43,147 --> 01:14:44,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I forget your name.

1094
01:14:44,028 --> 01:14:44,949
[SPEAKER_16]: That's my test.

1095
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:46,532
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to see if they're listening.

1096
01:14:47,013 --> 01:14:48,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Come downstairs and say something to me on the show.

1097
01:14:48,475 --> 01:14:50,078
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm afraid they would have turned it off a long time ago.

1098
01:14:50,658 --> 01:14:51,600
[SPEAKER_16]: They probably got bored.

1099
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:52,341
[SPEAKER_16]: This is so boring.

1100
01:14:52,361 --> 01:14:53,944
[SPEAKER_16]: The Guitar Freaks chat probably put them to sleep.

1101
01:14:54,548 --> 01:15:00,232
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, well let's wake everybody up with some... Oh no, you wanted to respond to some comments in the chatroom, you wanted to take a topic shift.

1102
01:15:00,732 --> 01:15:06,997
[SPEAKER_16]: Why don't we go to break, and then we'll come back and you can do the other topic, and then we'll do the cage match, because we need to get to tonight's cage match as well.

1103
01:15:07,297 --> 01:15:07,857
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, we'll do that.

1104
01:15:08,898 --> 01:15:15,183
[SPEAKER_16]: We are... Oh, you see that in the chatroom right now?

1105
01:15:15,203 --> 01:15:17,064
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh!

1106
01:15:17,104 --> 01:15:17,164
Oh!

1107
01:15:20,885 --> 01:15:21,825
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, hey, hello!

1108
01:15:22,486 --> 01:15:25,306
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

1109
01:15:27,627 --> 01:15:29,808
[SPEAKER_10]: I was wondering who the new people in the chat room were.

1110
01:15:29,828 --> 01:15:31,648
[SPEAKER_16]: There you go, you never know who the new people are.

1111
01:15:32,208 --> 01:15:34,809
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, we'll be back after this break.

1112
01:15:34,869 --> 01:15:42,912
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to play Jamie's, she's out tonight because she's sick, but she wanted to hear some Liar Liar from Guitar Freaks 4th, all that talk about Guitar Freaks.

1113
01:15:42,932 --> 01:15:43,392
[SPEAKER_16]: So here it is.

1114
01:15:43,812 --> 01:15:44,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Enjoy.

1115
01:16:10,615 --> 01:16:11,656
and the rest of the band.

1116
01:16:43,417 --> 01:16:44,959
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1117
01:17:30,763 --> 01:17:31,767
[SPEAKER_03]: We have got the bomb!

1118
01:18:05,087 --> 01:18:05,991
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1119
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:11,506
Thanks for watching!

1120
01:20:42,117 --> 01:20:43,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1121
01:20:43,697 --> 01:20:45,838
[SPEAKER_14]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

1122
01:20:52,399 --> 01:20:54,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1123
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:55,300
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

1124
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:59,781
[SPEAKER_16]: That's funny, because during the break, the neighbors came downstairs, so they were listening.

1125
01:21:00,741 --> 01:21:01,301
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you know?

1126
01:21:02,081 --> 01:21:06,122
[SPEAKER_16]: So, we have to refrain from talking about how much Folsom sucks right now.

1127
01:21:06,142 --> 01:21:08,983
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, let's keep the language down to a minimum.

1128
01:21:10,717 --> 01:21:11,217
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1129
01:21:33,968 --> 01:21:44,816
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to be talking about condoning any kind of illegal activity, except I'm just going to say there's some skepticism about mod chips for next generation systems.

1130
01:21:44,856 --> 01:21:50,480
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm speaking specifically of Sucksbox, Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube.

1131
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:53,982
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know anything about Xbox.

1132
01:21:54,383 --> 01:21:55,143
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care to.

1133
01:21:55,363 --> 01:21:56,224
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like Xbox.

1134
01:21:56,284 --> 01:21:57,105
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to talk on that.

1135
01:21:57,785 --> 01:22:00,586
[SPEAKER_10]: GameCube, there's no current way to copy games.

1136
01:22:00,646 --> 01:22:03,927
[SPEAKER_16]: So there is no reason... Although Matt thinks he heard something today.

1137
01:22:03,947 --> 01:22:04,807
[SPEAKER_16]: Matt, what's that, Matt?

1138
01:22:05,467 --> 01:22:06,107
[SPEAKER_16]: I read something today.

1139
01:22:06,127 --> 01:22:11,629
[SPEAKER_16]: I downloaded this off of supernova.org, your wonderful BitTorrent site.

1140
01:22:12,089 --> 01:22:15,990
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways, it is... And let me pull this up real quick here.

1141
01:22:16,730 --> 01:22:20,991
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, it's a... I bought... It's a GameCube pack is what I got.

1142
01:22:21,031 --> 01:22:22,092
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a bunch of different files.

1143
01:22:22,992 --> 01:22:25,273
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the files on there is called...

1144
01:22:26,813 --> 01:22:28,615
[SPEAKER_16]: PSUL 1.1 GameCube Code Uploader

1145
01:22:50,317 --> 01:22:52,960
[SPEAKER_16]: Using your network adapter.

1146
01:22:53,220 --> 01:23:05,631
[SPEAKER_16]: So basically the way it works is you have to have a copy of Phantasy Star Online, a broadband adapter, a PC to GameCube cable basically, just a network cable from your... A patch cable.

1147
01:23:07,113 --> 01:23:08,434
[SPEAKER_16]: An Ethernet card, of course.

1148
01:23:08,474 --> 01:23:12,778
[SPEAKER_16]: So basically you're just making a network connection from your GameCube to your PC.

1149
01:23:13,298 --> 01:23:13,819
[SPEAKER_15]: And you just...

1150
01:23:14,699 --> 01:23:26,407
[SPEAKER_15]: and you have to set up your computer on a certain IP so it can communicate with it and you set up your IP in your Phantasy Star Online thing and you basically

1151
01:23:27,131 --> 01:23:29,274
[SPEAKER_16]: Make a connection with Phantasy Star Online

1152
01:23:46,295 --> 01:23:46,936
[SPEAKER_15]: Very glitchy.

1153
01:23:47,576 --> 01:23:51,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Games they've gotten to work on it are Luigi's Mansion works fine.

1154
01:23:53,622 --> 01:23:54,302
[SPEAKER_15]: What was the other one?

1155
01:23:54,342 --> 01:23:57,145
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was Animal Crossing they can get to work also.

1156
01:23:57,205 --> 01:24:04,371
[SPEAKER_10]: This just means we're this much closer to finally figuring out a way to back up, quote unquote, your games for GameCube.

1157
01:24:05,287 --> 01:24:08,451
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, they actually have a program that supposedly does that, too.

1158
01:24:08,772 --> 01:24:09,753
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not really been taped.

1159
01:24:09,853 --> 01:24:21,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I've heard, because, Mike, I have a cousin who's, you know, been renamed Nameless, or remained Nameless, if, anyway, who apparently is, like, he's on the top always with all the, um...

1160
01:24:22,421 --> 01:24:25,102
[SPEAKER_10]: The backing up of games for all systems.

1161
01:24:25,162 --> 01:24:29,564
[SPEAKER_10]: And he told me a couple months ago that apparently there was no way to do it yet for GameCube.

1162
01:24:29,644 --> 01:24:32,865
[SPEAKER_10]: But, hey, in the next couple months they may have found something out.

1163
01:24:32,965 --> 01:24:41,129
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just really funny because I love watching how companies come out and say their system is so secure.

1164
01:24:41,389 --> 01:24:41,949
[SPEAKER_15]: It's foolproof.

1165
01:24:42,309 --> 01:24:44,690
[SPEAKER_10]: And those are the companies that are the easiest to crack.

1166
01:24:44,850 --> 01:24:48,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Nintendo's never really had a really good way to block...

1167
01:24:48,672 --> 01:24:49,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Piracy.

1168
01:24:49,633 --> 01:24:52,054
[SPEAKER_15]: Supposedly, you know what's also weird?

1169
01:24:52,314 --> 01:25:00,679
[SPEAKER_15]: Supposedly, I don't know if the GameCube is backwards compatible, but supposedly I read on one of the posts that Nintendo 64 ROM images work on there, too.

1170
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:01,640
[SPEAKER_16]: It's possible.

1171
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:02,820
[SPEAKER_16]: What are you talking about?

1172
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,222
[SPEAKER_16]: Nintendo's always had one of the best ways to block piracy.

1173
01:25:05,262 --> 01:25:06,242
[SPEAKER_16]: They have cartridges.

1174
01:25:06,622 --> 01:25:08,624
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't copy a cartridge very easily.

1175
01:25:08,884 --> 01:25:10,325
[SPEAKER_16]: You can, but it's not easy.

1176
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:13,606
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not as easy as putting in a PlayStation disc, click, copy, done.

1177
01:25:13,626 --> 01:25:14,667
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, here's the thing, though.

1178
01:25:14,707 --> 01:25:15,528
[SPEAKER_10]: and having a modded PSX.

1179
01:25:15,608 --> 01:25:16,448
[SPEAKER_10]: It's similar.

1180
01:25:16,749 --> 01:25:19,291
[SPEAKER_10]: It's easy in ways and not as easy in other ways.

1181
01:25:19,951 --> 01:25:23,034
[SPEAKER_10]: For the N64, my cousin had this thing called the V-Doctor.

1182
01:25:23,334 --> 01:25:25,576
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a pretty pricey drive.

1183
01:25:25,596 --> 01:25:33,782
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a CD-ROM drive you stuck underneath the N64 and it hooked up to it through this little serial cable thing that was on the N64.

1184
01:25:34,283 --> 01:25:35,844
[SPEAKER_10]: You hooked that into your hard drive.

1185
01:25:36,619 --> 01:25:50,807
[SPEAKER_10]: And what you would do, or to your computer, or what you could, the reason why I had a CD-ROM drive is because you could either burn a CD full of ROM images from N64 games, and then put it in this little V-Doctor thing, this drive, and it would play the games on your N64.

1186
01:25:51,067 --> 01:25:53,429
[SPEAKER_10]: You just had to have this other little cartridge, it was like a blank...

1187
01:25:54,162 --> 01:25:56,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Ram cartridge that you would plug into your N64.

1188
01:25:56,323 --> 01:26:02,606
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, he had every freaking American and Japanese N64 game out.

1189
01:26:02,806 --> 01:26:07,148
[SPEAKER_10]: And even stuff that hadn't come out yet, when I went over to his place, I was like, wow, how'd you do this?

1190
01:26:07,408 --> 01:26:08,569
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, he was doing it.

1191
01:26:08,589 --> 01:26:09,309
[SPEAKER_10]: He was pirating it.

1192
01:26:09,669 --> 01:26:14,492
[SPEAKER_10]: And even Super Nintendo, there were, you know, obviously there's ROM images and there's emulation.

1193
01:26:14,572 --> 01:26:16,132
[SPEAKER_10]: It was funny.

1194
01:26:16,172 --> 01:26:18,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I saw an auction for it.

1195
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:19,394
[SPEAKER_15]: It was an arcade game.

1196
01:26:20,655 --> 01:26:26,801
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what game they would use this in, but it was an arcade memory card reader for a Nintendo 64.

1197
01:26:26,881 --> 01:26:29,063
[SPEAKER_15]: It sold for, I believe, 99 cents.

1198
01:26:31,025 --> 01:26:33,507
[SPEAKER_16]: NFL Blitz, I think, is the game that uses it.

1199
01:26:33,547 --> 01:26:34,668
[SPEAKER_16]: Because Roseville Golf Line has one.

1200
01:26:34,788 --> 01:26:36,950
[SPEAKER_16]: I've seen the Nintendo 64 memory card thing.

1201
01:26:36,990 --> 01:26:38,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody uses that on here.

1202
01:26:38,251 --> 01:26:38,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody uses it.

1203
01:26:40,173 --> 01:26:45,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, and my point was how it's easier in some ways is because you didn't have to mod any of the Nintendo systems.

1204
01:26:45,577 --> 01:26:56,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas, like with Sony's, you have to get inside, void your warranty, solder here, solder there with this little chip you buy, and then possibly mess up your system, which I have done once out of like the 30 PlayStation systems I've modded.

1205
01:26:57,007 --> 01:27:01,170
[SPEAKER_15]: If I remember correctly, I think the Xbox, you don't actually have to... Supposedly, yeah.

1206
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:02,251
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a software mod, I think.

1207
01:27:02,271 --> 01:27:03,052
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some software.

1208
01:27:04,654 --> 01:27:08,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is not surprising, because you look at all the flaws in Microsoft software, so hey.

1209
01:27:09,716 --> 01:27:11,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, well you want to get back to the original topic.

1210
01:27:11,937 --> 01:27:16,739
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to talk about next-gen modding, which you have advised me against in the past.

1211
01:27:16,959 --> 01:27:18,099
[SPEAKER_10]: In the past, in the past.

1212
01:27:18,279 --> 01:27:25,102
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've always said, every time I brought this up in the past, like when PS2 first came out, because this is the current subject now, PS2.

1213
01:27:26,122 --> 01:27:30,884
[SPEAKER_10]: In the past I said, it's not worth your time to buy a mod chip for PS2.

1214
01:27:30,964 --> 01:27:33,025
[SPEAKER_10]: And when I said in the past, I mean like when it came out.

1215
01:27:33,689 --> 01:27:46,881
[SPEAKER_10]: because they would come out with new games that would have mod detection, that would have, you know, mod chip detection, that would basically lock out the game so you couldn't play it, or specifically, mostly that's going on for a lot of the online titles, which there isn't really many for PS2 anyway.

1216
01:27:47,041 --> 01:27:47,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Not right now.

1217
01:27:49,524 --> 01:27:52,106
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there were ways... Final Fantasy XI, just around the corner.

1218
01:27:52,126 --> 01:27:52,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1219
01:27:52,687 --> 01:27:55,869
[SPEAKER_10]: There was, you know, ways that they could combat it.

1220
01:27:56,350 --> 01:27:59,393
[SPEAKER_10]: My cousin bought, a year ago, a mod chip for his PS2.

1221
01:28:00,385 --> 01:28:04,687
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's not as like, you know, new-y, fan-dangled and, you know, great as the newer ones out.

1222
01:28:05,007 --> 01:28:07,088
[SPEAKER_10]: But it has not given him a problem since.

1223
01:28:07,148 --> 01:28:11,370
[SPEAKER_10]: He's been able to back up every game that's come out since and play it fine.

1224
01:28:12,770 --> 01:28:13,791
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a year ago.

1225
01:28:14,171 --> 01:28:19,893
[SPEAKER_10]: So Sony has not been, you know, and what I always had said was that, you know, wait till PS2 starts to die out, you know.

1226
01:28:20,353 --> 01:28:26,816
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they're still making games for it, but it's not too far off that we're going to hear of the PS3 or whatever their new system's going to be.

1227
01:28:27,961 --> 01:28:29,022
[SPEAKER_10]: and Loki says already is.

1228
01:28:29,042 --> 01:28:30,584
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't been keeping me up.

1229
01:28:30,644 --> 01:28:36,472
[SPEAKER_16]: I say once it hits $99, which is pretty soon, that's when everybody had a modded PlayStation.

1230
01:28:36,512 --> 01:28:36,872
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.

1231
01:28:36,912 --> 01:28:38,554
[SPEAKER_16]: That's when everybody's going to have a modded PlayStation 2.

1232
01:28:38,694 --> 01:28:40,377
[SPEAKER_16]: Except me, I have no reason for one.

1233
01:28:40,617 --> 01:28:42,179
[SPEAKER_10]: I honestly have no reason to get a modded PlayStation.

1234
01:28:42,279 --> 01:28:43,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's my point, though.

1235
01:28:43,675 --> 01:28:45,496
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a newer mod chip called the DMS3.

1236
01:28:46,337 --> 01:28:48,178
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you can go to DMS3.com.

1237
01:28:48,438 --> 01:28:49,119
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll bring it up.

1238
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:56,764
[SPEAKER_10]: This mod chip, it's just as difficult to mod your PlayStation 2 as it is with any of the other PS2 mod chips, but this one has flash memory on it.

1239
01:28:57,405 --> 01:29:04,029
[SPEAKER_10]: And it has two BIOS flashes on it, and you can get updates, which you burn onto CDs,

1240
01:29:05,050 --> 01:29:07,952
[SPEAKER_10]: from their site that flash it to the newest BIOS.

1241
01:29:07,992 --> 01:29:10,734
[SPEAKER_10]: So say a new game comes out and it detects the mod chip.

1242
01:29:11,094 --> 01:29:12,015
[SPEAKER_10]: You go to their newest site.

1243
01:29:12,295 --> 01:29:13,315
[SPEAKER_10]: They are on top of it.

1244
01:29:13,395 --> 01:29:15,117
[SPEAKER_10]: You download their little BIOS flash.

1245
01:29:15,437 --> 01:29:16,918
[SPEAKER_10]: You burn it in a CD, put it in your PS2.

1246
01:29:17,904 --> 01:29:18,965
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go, you can play the game now.

1247
01:29:19,345 --> 01:29:28,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, because of that, there's all these other new features on the DMS3 where you can, when you're loading your PS2, you hold a button down, it sets it to turn off mod chip.

1248
01:29:28,672 --> 01:29:39,300
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you want to play online games, like say you actually bought a real copy of Final Fantasy XI, and it's locking you out of their online server because you have a mod chip, you hold the button down, it disables your mod chip, now you can play online.

1249
01:29:39,881 --> 01:29:42,623
[SPEAKER_10]: This new DMS3 mod chip is the one to get, I'm telling you.

1250
01:29:43,403 --> 01:29:45,305
[SPEAKER_10]: It's time you could mod your freaking PS2s.

1251
01:29:46,661 --> 01:29:51,105
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want people going out there saying that it's worthless, because you can do it now.

1252
01:29:51,385 --> 01:29:56,469
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it's just... But there may not be a reason to do it.

1253
01:29:56,530 --> 01:29:57,410
[SPEAKER_16]: For some people, there's no reason.

1254
01:29:57,450 --> 01:29:58,151
[SPEAKER_16]: For me, there's no reason.

1255
01:29:58,171 --> 01:29:59,852
[SPEAKER_16]: There is nothing left I want to play on PS2.

1256
01:29:59,992 --> 01:30:00,293
[SPEAKER_16]: Nothing.

1257
01:30:00,553 --> 01:30:05,217
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, for me, I think all... And I have a Japanese... Everything I want to play is Japanese, anyway.

1258
01:30:05,958 --> 01:30:08,460
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, technically, with a mod chip, I can play the Japanese games, but...

1259
01:30:09,969 --> 01:30:10,790
[SPEAKER_16]: There's just not that many.

1260
01:30:10,810 --> 01:30:11,370
[SPEAKER_16]: There's not enough.

1261
01:30:11,450 --> 01:30:13,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, your point is taken.

1262
01:30:13,872 --> 01:30:17,594
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's some of us untrustworthy people out there who want to play our other games.

1263
01:30:19,635 --> 01:30:21,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Pictures of our games.

1264
01:30:22,097 --> 01:30:24,118
[SPEAKER_10]: You tell me how to mod my GameCube, I'm on it.

1265
01:30:24,138 --> 01:30:25,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I play my GameCube more than anything else.

1266
01:30:25,859 --> 01:30:27,701
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think you're ever going to need to mod your GameCube.

1267
01:30:27,761 --> 01:30:30,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Eventually there's going to be a way around it, like Loki just said.

1268
01:30:30,743 --> 01:30:31,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1269
01:30:32,096 --> 01:30:33,658
[SPEAKER_10]: There's always going to be a way around it.

1270
01:30:33,698 --> 01:30:33,979
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

1271
01:30:33,999 --> 01:30:35,300
[SPEAKER_16]: This is what they all say.

1272
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,263
[SPEAKER_16]: When PS3 comes out, it's going to be online.

1273
01:30:37,403 --> 01:30:38,825
[SPEAKER_16]: You're going to download your games online.

1274
01:30:38,885 --> 01:30:39,746
[SPEAKER_16]: Everything's going to be online.

1275
01:30:39,766 --> 01:30:41,649
[SPEAKER_16]: You're not going to be able to mod this shit anymore.

1276
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:43,011
[SPEAKER_16]: Never going to happen.

1277
01:30:43,091 --> 01:30:44,072
[SPEAKER_16]: Why do you say that, LB?

1278
01:30:45,134 --> 01:30:45,815
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1279
01:31:16,047 --> 01:31:23,030
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, what about something like iTunes, which is the way you can download music online, and they've sold, what, 10 million songs today.

1280
01:31:23,070 --> 01:31:24,431
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the most successful online one.

1281
01:31:24,791 --> 01:31:34,536
[SPEAKER_16]: True, it's not nearly as big as going into the store and buying things, but for those people that prefer to buy their things online, they have a pretty viable option, and it's somewhat successful.

1282
01:31:35,036 --> 01:31:38,298
[SPEAKER_10]: For people who are talking, I think Baka is saying, was it DMS3 or DMX?

1283
01:31:38,378 --> 01:31:39,618
[SPEAKER_10]: It's DMS3.

1284
01:31:39,938 --> 01:31:42,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Go to DMS3.com, you can find out about it.

1285
01:31:42,139 --> 01:31:48,142
[SPEAKER_16]: But the thing is, though, is I don't like not buy a game because I only like a portion of the game.

1286
01:31:49,222 --> 01:31:53,504
[SPEAKER_16]: See, now with CDs, I may only like one song, so I'm only going to buy that one song.

1287
01:31:53,644 --> 01:31:59,487
[SPEAKER_16]: If the only way I can buy that song is online, then yeah, I'm going to go ahead and do that because there might not be a single for that.

1288
01:32:00,649 --> 01:32:06,491
[SPEAKER_16]: In my case, I don't buy music because it's too damn expensive and the artists mostly suck.

1289
01:32:06,531 --> 01:32:11,353
[SPEAKER_16]: If I want to discover new music, I'm going to go about it the illegal way and download it for free.

1290
01:32:12,113 --> 01:32:20,536
[SPEAKER_16]: Or, I'm going to go listen to those independent artists that don't get any coverage and those normally end up being better than the most mainstream artists anyways.

1291
01:32:21,136 --> 01:32:25,898
[SPEAKER_16]: So, why should I spend money and pay for your product when it stinks?

1292
01:32:26,398 --> 01:32:26,698
[SPEAKER_16]: When it...

1293
01:32:27,398 --> 01:32:28,058
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura.com

1294
01:32:58,126 --> 01:32:59,207
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1295
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:16,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah.

1296
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:18,201
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, the big bad R.I.A.

1297
01:33:18,221 --> 01:33:20,142
[SPEAKER_16]: is going to track us down.

1298
01:33:20,182 --> 01:33:20,562
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever.

1299
01:33:20,602 --> 01:33:23,204
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I don't listen to a lot of music in the first place.

1300
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:25,505
[SPEAKER_16]: Most of the music I listen to is just Bomani stuff.

1301
01:33:26,466 --> 01:33:27,326
[SPEAKER_16]: Homemade remixes.

1302
01:33:27,626 --> 01:33:29,147
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't listen to a lot of mainstream stuff.

1303
01:33:30,068 --> 01:33:34,350
[SPEAKER_16]: I was hoping to save the iTunes topic for Vanilla Sky tomorrow night, but whatever.

1304
01:33:34,370 --> 01:33:34,750
[SPEAKER_16]: That's fine.

1305
01:33:35,511 --> 01:33:37,292
[SPEAKER_10]: On topic of mainstream stuff, real quick.

1306
01:33:37,672 --> 01:33:37,892
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1307
01:33:37,912 --> 01:33:37,992
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1308
01:33:39,292 --> 01:33:39,933
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.

1309
01:33:54,943 --> 01:33:55,743
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

1310
01:34:13,474 --> 01:34:16,715
[SPEAKER_16]: To some extent, I believe in supporting the artist for a song I really, really like.

1311
01:34:16,815 --> 01:34:18,756
[SPEAKER_16]: And the songs I downloaded, I really, really like.

1312
01:34:19,276 --> 01:34:24,018
[SPEAKER_16]: And B, because when I try to find these songs on FileShare, I get shit copies.

1313
01:34:24,438 --> 01:34:28,540
[SPEAKER_16]: Every time I get lousy volume, I get just cut things.

1314
01:34:28,940 --> 01:34:29,500
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know what?

1315
01:34:29,620 --> 01:34:34,662
[SPEAKER_16]: It is just worth the goddamn dollar to just get a perfect quality song the first time.

1316
01:34:35,863 --> 01:34:36,163
[SPEAKER_16]: The end.

1317
01:34:36,563 --> 01:34:36,903
[SPEAKER_16]: That's me.

1318
01:34:37,103 --> 01:34:38,964
[SPEAKER_16]: But we'll talk more about iTunes tomorrow.

1319
01:34:40,517 --> 01:34:47,139
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, so you wanted to say... Oh, what I was going to say is that people who will probably go, oh no, piracy would be where it is now, even if they did do it.

1320
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:57,463
[SPEAKER_10]: It may have gotten to the point eventually, but not as quickly, because I believe that once you put a... What do you call it?

1321
01:34:57,483 --> 01:34:58,143
[SPEAKER_10]: What am I looking for?

1322
01:34:58,203 --> 01:35:02,625
[SPEAKER_10]: You put like a rule or a... God, obstacle.

1323
01:35:02,705 --> 01:35:07,787
[SPEAKER_10]: You put an obstacle in the way of somebody, and they want to overcome it, they will, and they'll find a way to overcome it.

1324
01:35:07,807 --> 01:35:08,087
[SPEAKER_10]: You put...

1325
01:35:08,985 --> 01:35:09,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1326
01:35:19,221 --> 01:35:20,422
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you made, that's a good point.

1327
01:35:20,442 --> 01:35:26,288
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if they had put it up, they wouldn't be having as much problems right now with what they've announced.

1328
01:35:26,308 --> 01:35:26,828
[SPEAKER_10]: But they didn't.

1329
01:35:27,048 --> 01:35:27,529
[SPEAKER_16]: End of story.

1330
01:35:28,089 --> 01:35:33,614
[SPEAKER_16]: RAA did not act fast enough, which is why the MPAA is trying so hard right now with the movies thing.

1331
01:35:34,175 --> 01:35:41,121
[SPEAKER_16]: They're trying to get all these movie services up and going, and although Loki's right, there's not that many people that really want to watch movies online.

1332
01:35:42,002 --> 01:35:42,763
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, you want to go in.

1333
01:35:42,783 --> 01:35:43,263
[SPEAKER_16]: They're trying.

1334
01:35:43,503 --> 01:35:45,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Movies is a thing that will never...

1335
01:35:46,479 --> 01:35:47,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1336
01:36:04,582 --> 01:36:06,083
[SPEAKER_16]: You are changing experience.

1337
01:36:06,203 --> 01:36:11,924
[SPEAKER_16]: Because now not only do I have to go buy a game system that's fucking expensive when it comes out because they have all these new features.

1338
01:36:12,424 --> 01:36:14,225
[SPEAKER_16]: Now I have to buy a membership online.

1339
01:36:14,325 --> 01:36:17,406
[SPEAKER_15]: Now I have to buy cable internet where I might not have it.

1340
01:36:17,846 --> 01:36:19,386
[SPEAKER_15]: No, because it's not going to work on dial-up.

1341
01:36:19,726 --> 01:36:23,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, but if I do have dial-up, it's going to take four goddamn years to download the goddamn game.

1342
01:36:23,948 --> 01:36:27,509
[SPEAKER_15]: And what if there's a disconnection on, you know, what if my cable goes out or something?

1343
01:36:27,829 --> 01:36:28,609
[SPEAKER_15]: There goes my game.

1344
01:36:28,849 --> 01:36:31,510
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have my game stored on my hard drive because that crashes too.

1345
01:36:31,630 --> 01:36:31,910
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just...

1346
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:33,369
[SPEAKER_15]: Too much stuff.

1347
01:36:33,409 --> 01:36:34,590
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to have a game.

1348
01:36:34,810 --> 01:36:37,553
[SPEAKER_16]: How are they going to rent product then out at the stores?

1349
01:36:37,913 --> 01:36:42,358
[SPEAKER_16]: The rental businesses for games are going to go out because it's all online supposedly.

1350
01:36:42,758 --> 01:36:44,480
[SPEAKER_16]: But the MPAA would not care.

1351
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:45,942
[SPEAKER_16]: They would love to see that happen.

1352
01:36:47,563 --> 01:36:50,426
[SPEAKER_16]: The MPAA would care because people like to rent movies.

1353
01:36:50,466 --> 01:36:51,668
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't like to buy movies.

1354
01:36:52,188 --> 01:36:52,448
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay?

1355
01:36:52,688 --> 01:36:54,049
[SPEAKER_16]: Because renting a movie costs $5.

1356
01:36:54,349 --> 01:36:55,789
[SPEAKER_16]: You see it once, you're done.

1357
01:36:56,089 --> 01:37:04,932
[SPEAKER_16]: Instead of investing, you know, that money and watching that movie and having it at home, like I have tons of movies I buy and don't watch, it's just stupid.

1358
01:37:05,493 --> 01:37:11,075
[SPEAKER_16]: But if they could be in control of the movie renting and not Blockbuster, that's capitalism.

1359
01:37:11,875 --> 01:37:16,556
[SPEAKER_10]: See, like I said, the movie renting and movie business will not change completely.

1360
01:37:16,616 --> 01:37:18,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, it won't go completely online.

1361
01:37:18,037 --> 01:37:20,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Because regardless of whether people want to buy or rent or whatever...

1362
01:37:21,508 --> 01:37:27,010
[SPEAKER_10]: People still want to see movies on the big screen and if they want to rent then they'll go to the movie rental places and rent them.

1363
01:37:27,030 --> 01:37:28,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Those won't go out of business.

1364
01:37:28,151 --> 01:37:41,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe renting video games will go, but the fact is that they're obviously not going to implement or try to implement something like that until every internet connection in America is broadband.

1365
01:37:42,026 --> 01:37:46,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Until it's standard to get broadband and extremely cost efficient.

1366
01:37:46,669 --> 01:37:50,972
[SPEAKER_15]: The only way it'll ever be like that is when broadband becomes as common as electricity.

1367
01:37:51,213 --> 01:37:51,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1368
01:37:51,993 --> 01:37:56,516
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is something that they've talked about in the last, like, five years ago.

1369
01:37:56,536 --> 01:37:57,497
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a thing called...

1370
01:37:58,493 --> 01:38:08,857
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't remember, I used to have the website for it, but they were basically saying that they could get speeds of like fiber optic speed, you know how fast fiber optic networks go, that kind of speed from your electrical outlet.

1371
01:38:09,518 --> 01:38:22,683
[SPEAKER_10]: They could do this thing where they could make the, they take the digital signal from wherever the server is, they convert it to analog, and they put it in I think a really, really low frequency, just kind of like how DSL is, and they run it through the power lines.

1372
01:38:23,064 --> 01:38:26,145
[SPEAKER_10]: And it goes at like fiber optic speeds.

1373
01:38:26,645 --> 01:38:37,709
[SPEAKER_10]: And they just have to install these, they have to build these up, these like switching boxes in cities in certain areas because there's only so much, there's a signal degradation that happens, you know.

1374
01:38:38,770 --> 01:38:42,371
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that was like five years ago and they said they were still working on it and they want it.

1375
01:38:42,431 --> 01:38:52,795
[SPEAKER_10]: But basically that kind of idea makes you wonder, you know, in the near future, in like the next ten years, we could see where you plug in your appliance, your computer, to the wall and it's got an internet connection.

1376
01:38:53,836 --> 01:38:56,457
[SPEAKER_16]: They talk about fridges with internet connection and all this crazy stuff.

1377
01:38:56,477 --> 01:38:58,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they talk about that on the same page.

1378
01:38:58,098 --> 01:39:01,359
[SPEAKER_10]: They said something about how, like, what if your toaster was plugged in.

1379
01:39:01,539 --> 01:39:03,600
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want my toaster being plugged in the internet, obviously.

1380
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:07,021
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want freaking, like, advertisements burning onto my toast.

1381
01:39:07,881 --> 01:39:09,922
[SPEAKER_10]: My toaster comes up and it's got an Apple logo on it.

1382
01:39:10,362 --> 01:39:13,403
[SPEAKER_16]: I can see it writing in your journal, today kind of sucked.

1383
01:39:13,483 --> 01:39:17,125
[SPEAKER_16]: A hacker broke into my toaster today and started burning my bread.

1384
01:39:17,865 --> 01:39:18,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.

1385
01:39:18,705 --> 01:39:20,326
[SPEAKER_16]: See, I don't want that kind of thing.

1386
01:39:20,766 --> 01:39:21,086
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1387
01:39:21,587 --> 01:39:23,749
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to bring up a point from the chat room real fast.

1388
01:39:24,130 --> 01:39:25,571
[SPEAKER_16]: John Fields makes a pretty good point.

1389
01:39:25,631 --> 01:39:33,819
[SPEAKER_16]: He says, All I have to say, if the MPAA had control of renting, unfair monopoly that the government would thus force Blockbuster to take over again.

1390
01:39:33,879 --> 01:39:36,222
[SPEAKER_16]: So he's suggesting that the MPAA did have control of all of this stuff.

1391
01:39:36,835 --> 01:39:38,097
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

1392
01:39:55,037 --> 01:39:58,360
[SPEAKER_16]: to do this all online, and they will fight this to the death.

1393
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:07,888
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to understand, most of the people that you talk to out there, I mean, because we have our exposure with our friends who are all connected to the internet, all wired individuals.

1394
01:40:07,988 --> 01:40:12,532
[SPEAKER_16]: But your average Joe doesn't know jack about computers, won't touch it because they act like it's the devil.

1395
01:40:13,113 --> 01:40:13,793
[SPEAKER_15]: My father.

1396
01:40:14,654 --> 01:40:18,618
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't get it, and if they switch it all to online, they're never going to get it.

1397
01:40:18,638 --> 01:40:19,078
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, but you know what?

1398
01:40:19,098 --> 01:40:19,939
[SPEAKER_16]: Those people are dying.

1399
01:40:20,519 --> 01:40:21,400
[SPEAKER_16]: And in about 20 years...

1400
01:40:22,541 --> 01:40:26,185
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not going to... Everybody on the earth will know how to use a computer.

1401
01:40:26,225 --> 01:40:26,966
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I'm sorry.

1402
01:40:27,166 --> 01:40:27,807
[SPEAKER_16]: I shouldn't say that.

1403
01:40:27,927 --> 01:40:33,273
[SPEAKER_16]: Because America's... Everybody in America, in the industrialized nations, will know how to use a computer.

1404
01:40:33,774 --> 01:40:37,238
[SPEAKER_16]: I retract my statement because there's countries that aren't going to still be on computers.

1405
01:40:37,578 --> 01:40:38,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's proof.

1406
01:40:38,659 --> 01:40:47,306
[SPEAKER_10]: In the 80s, in the late 70s, like when arcade games and stuff were coming out, like, you know, late, the 70s, and I think actually, I don't remember, my timelines are bad.

1407
01:40:47,787 --> 01:40:54,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, people who played arcade games, you know, probably usually a lot of them were kind of older, they were like in their late teens, 20s and stuff.

1408
01:40:55,794 --> 01:41:02,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Video game consoles started coming out, and with the newer generations, kids started playing at younger ages, 8 or 9, you know, with Nintendo.

1409
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:04,101
[SPEAKER_10]: My friend's brother...

1410
01:41:04,445 --> 01:41:05,365
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanna make a quick plug.

1411
01:41:05,385 --> 01:41:06,946
[SPEAKER_10]: On Vanilla Sky tomorrow night, we're gonna bring up an article

1412
01:41:27,952 --> 01:41:34,580
[SPEAKER_16]: where they talk about these young kids and they're going to make these young kids play games that we played when we were young kids.

1413
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:37,223
[SPEAKER_16]: Just wait to hear what they have to say.

1414
01:41:37,563 --> 01:41:39,766
[SPEAKER_16]: You are going to feel so old tomorrow night.

1415
01:41:39,786 --> 01:41:40,687
[SPEAKER_16]: 7 o'clock, Vanilla Sky.

1416
01:41:40,727 --> 01:41:41,728
[SPEAKER_16]: I love that idea.

1417
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:47,980
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand.

1418
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:49,621
[SPEAKER_10]: The characters don't talk to you.

1419
01:41:49,941 --> 01:41:50,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, vocally.

1420
01:41:51,201 --> 01:41:52,462
[SPEAKER_10]: So, which block am I?

1421
01:41:53,803 --> 01:41:55,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Ew, it's... What is this?

1422
01:41:55,224 --> 01:41:56,565
[SPEAKER_10]: This little blocky thing?

1423
01:41:57,005 --> 01:41:58,366
[SPEAKER_16]: Why does that... It's like mustard.

1424
01:41:58,406 --> 01:41:59,226
[SPEAKER_10]: It's attacking me.

1425
01:41:59,246 --> 01:42:01,648
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there anything else you want to say about mod chips, Brad?

1426
01:42:01,668 --> 01:42:03,269
[SPEAKER_16]: We've kind of got off on all these tangents tonight.

1427
01:42:03,449 --> 01:42:07,591
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, for being... Half of us being sick, we sure have a lot to say tonight.

1428
01:42:07,711 --> 01:42:10,893
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like we're just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah-ing from one topic to another.

1429
01:42:10,953 --> 01:42:11,514
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's alright.

1430
01:42:11,554 --> 01:42:12,314
[SPEAKER_16]: I kind of like it, so...

1431
01:42:14,316 --> 01:42:16,519
[SPEAKER_10]: There may not be any organization involved today.

1432
01:42:16,539 --> 01:42:17,580
[SPEAKER_16]: That's alright, that's alright.

1433
01:42:17,820 --> 01:42:18,501
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the sickness.

1434
01:42:19,242 --> 01:42:21,424
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the sickness, this extreme inorganization.

1435
01:42:21,444 --> 01:42:22,866
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there anything else you want to say about Monchips?

1436
01:42:23,427 --> 01:42:24,948
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't jump to the cage match.

1437
01:42:26,030 --> 01:42:27,251
[SPEAKER_10]: There will always be a way.

1438
01:42:27,792 --> 01:42:29,654
[SPEAKER_10]: People who are out there saying, no, it's worthless.

1439
01:42:29,694 --> 01:42:32,397
[SPEAKER_16]: No, there will always be a way.

1440
01:42:32,637 --> 01:42:32,877
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1441
01:42:34,497 --> 01:42:42,820
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, if you'd like to comment on any of that, head on over to our chatroom, www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat.

1442
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:45,140
[SPEAKER_16]: And join in our chatroom.

1443
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:51,802
[SPEAKER_16]: And, by the way, being in our chatroom is the only way that you can participate in tonight's one and only Cage Match.

1444
01:42:53,123 --> 01:43:02,986
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, the Orange Lounge Cage Match is where we're going to play three songs back-to-back, one picked by me, one picked by DarkSakura, even though she's not here, she submitted her vote online to me, and one picked by Loki.

1445
01:43:04,188 --> 01:43:05,669
[SPEAKER_16]: and you can vote for one of those three songs.

1446
01:43:05,749 --> 01:43:13,414
[SPEAKER_16]: The winner goes into musical rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio, so you, the chatroom, have the power to decide which song will be played all week.

1447
01:43:13,855 --> 01:43:20,359
[SPEAKER_16]: We start off with last week's winner, which was a song brought to us by Loki, and since it was last week's winner, we're only going to hear a clip of it.

1448
01:43:21,079 --> 01:43:24,802
[SPEAKER_16]: The song is P8107, and it's a remix of Paranoia by...

1449
01:43:25,580 --> 01:43:25,980
[SPEAKER_13]: Onoken.

1450
01:43:26,321 --> 01:43:27,061
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Onoken.

1451
01:43:28,062 --> 01:43:28,822
[SPEAKER_16]: So here it is.

1452
01:43:28,883 --> 01:43:31,044
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a clip because it was last week's winner.

1453
01:43:31,064 --> 01:43:31,985
[SPEAKER_16]: You'll get to hear a little bit of it.

1454
01:43:32,325 --> 01:43:34,187
[SPEAKER_16]: Song number one tonight, last week's winner, P8107.

1455
01:43:34,207 --> 01:43:35,187
[SPEAKER_16]: Here we go.

1456
01:45:04,276 --> 01:45:06,257
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, that's song number one for tonight.

1457
01:45:06,297 --> 01:45:08,959
[SPEAKER_16]: That's P8107 by Ono Ken.

1458
01:45:09,660 --> 01:45:13,522
[SPEAKER_16]: Song number two tonight is my pick, and you get to hear the whole thing because it's a new song.

1459
01:45:14,463 --> 01:45:19,926
[SPEAKER_16]: I was on the internet not too long ago just downloading a bunch of remixes by Above and Beyond because I fucking love them, they're great.

1460
01:45:20,446 --> 01:45:23,688
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I wanted to get as many remixes by them as I could, and this is one of the ones I got.

1461
01:45:24,209 --> 01:45:29,212
[SPEAKER_16]: This is an artist called Ministry of Sound, and the song is Far From In Love, and it's the Above and Beyond mix.

1462
01:45:29,392 --> 01:45:29,732
[SPEAKER_16]: Enjoy.

1463
01:45:30,573 --> 01:45:32,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Song number two tonight that you can vote for in the cage match.

1464
01:47:06,172 --> 01:47:16,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see behind your eyes that you're afraid of who you are All this silence now between us, I'm amazed we've come this far, far from it

1465
01:47:33,066 --> 01:47:36,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a fire burn to memory, I know this is where it ends

1466
01:48:55,023 --> 01:48:56,370
Thank you for watching!

1467
01:49:56,343 --> 01:50:09,027
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, that was, I'm being corrected on the artist, sorry guys, that was actually Above and Beyond themselves doing that song, even better in my opinion, Far From In Love is the song, and if you're curious about that edit, it is from the CD Transnation 2003, which is an import, by the way.

1468
01:50:09,447 --> 01:50:12,148
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go around the room and see what people thought of that, start off with Loki.

1469
01:50:14,388 --> 01:50:15,769
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pretty cool, I liked it.

1470
01:50:16,949 --> 01:50:20,070
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Above and Beyond, so I can't go wrong with it.

1471
01:50:21,420 --> 01:50:26,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Now if it was Above and Beyond remixed by Paul Oakenpole, yeah, that would have been cool.

1472
01:50:26,903 --> 01:50:28,244
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, I give it an 8.

1473
01:50:30,005 --> 01:50:33,487
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie's submitted her vote via the internet since she's out sick today.

1474
01:50:33,527 --> 01:50:36,308
[SPEAKER_16]: If you guys are just joining us, Jamie's out sick today.

1475
01:50:36,388 --> 01:50:40,631
[SPEAKER_16]: She says, Rob, your song gets a 7.8 for being transalicious.

1476
01:50:40,731 --> 01:50:41,811
[SPEAKER_16]: No wait, I give it an 8.

1477
01:50:42,752 --> 01:50:44,333
[SPEAKER_16]: She's decided to be nice and round up.

1478
01:50:44,513 --> 01:50:45,073
[SPEAKER_16]: Wasn't that kind?

1479
01:50:45,934 --> 01:50:46,454
[SPEAKER_16]: My thoughts.

1480
01:50:47,150 --> 01:50:48,070
[SPEAKER_16]: God, it's great.

1481
01:50:48,210 --> 01:50:51,271
[SPEAKER_16]: And DarkTips3 said in the chatroom, it sounds like a total DDR song.

1482
01:50:51,311 --> 01:50:51,671
[SPEAKER_16]: You're right.

1483
01:50:51,731 --> 01:50:52,431
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's cool.

1484
01:50:52,491 --> 01:50:52,931
[SPEAKER_16]: I like it.

1485
01:50:53,311 --> 01:50:57,732
[SPEAKER_16]: And it gets a 9 for me, because Above and Beyond is like the shit.

1486
01:50:57,793 --> 01:50:58,173
[SPEAKER_16]: I love them.

1487
01:50:58,313 --> 01:50:58,993
[SPEAKER_16]: So, there you go.

1488
01:50:59,433 --> 01:50:59,753
[SPEAKER_16]: Bradley.

1489
01:51:00,913 --> 01:51:01,513
[SPEAKER_16]: Kind of pretty cool.

1490
01:51:02,274 --> 01:51:02,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Give it an 8.5.

1491
01:51:02,814 --> 01:51:02,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Brad.

1492
01:51:02,974 --> 01:51:07,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you don't have a mic?

1493
01:51:09,835 --> 01:51:11,076
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought you had a mic over there.

1494
01:51:15,217 --> 01:51:16,277
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't listening to it.

1495
01:51:16,477 --> 01:51:16,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1496
01:51:17,421 --> 01:51:24,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki was showing me this cool, uh... I don't know if Ken's beaten any SVX files on his simulator, so... Sorry, I didn't hear it.

1497
01:51:26,863 --> 01:51:28,844
[SPEAKER_16]: You didn't... You didn't hear any of it at all?

1498
01:51:29,004 --> 01:51:29,904
[SPEAKER_16]: You were standing right there!

1499
01:51:31,924 --> 01:51:33,204
[SPEAKER_16]: This was Loki's pick, or whose?

1500
01:51:33,785 --> 01:51:34,085
[SPEAKER_16]: Yours?

1501
01:51:34,785 --> 01:51:35,405
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm gonna give it a one.

1502
01:51:36,785 --> 01:51:37,245
[SPEAKER_16]: What the hell?

1503
01:51:37,785 --> 01:51:38,166
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1504
01:51:38,726 --> 01:51:41,246
[SPEAKER_16]: That was, uh, song number two, Above and Beyond, Far From Unloved.

1505
01:51:41,666 --> 01:51:43,407
[SPEAKER_16]: Here is... What?

1506
01:51:43,907 --> 01:51:44,567
[SPEAKER_16]: We're doing what again?

1507
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:48,861
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I thought the show was fucking up.

1508
01:51:49,221 --> 01:51:51,902
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, song number three is Jamie's pick.

1509
01:51:51,942 --> 01:51:53,343
[SPEAKER_16]: She sends this along.

1510
01:51:53,383 --> 01:51:57,865
[SPEAKER_16]: Even though she can't be here, she wants you all to hear it and hope that it'll win tonight's cage match.

1511
01:51:57,905 --> 01:51:58,325
[SPEAKER_16]: Here it is.

1512
01:51:59,525 --> 01:52:01,366
[SPEAKER_16]: I listened to this song before the show a little bit.

1513
01:52:01,406 --> 01:52:02,047
[SPEAKER_16]: It's pretty good.

1514
01:52:02,767 --> 01:52:03,767
[SPEAKER_16]: It's an Avex song.

1515
01:52:03,887 --> 01:52:04,728
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys know Avex.

1516
01:52:05,108 --> 01:52:07,169
[SPEAKER_16]: 2DX licenses a lot of tracks from them.

1517
01:52:09,192 --> 01:52:10,873
[SPEAKER_16]: Getting mic switched on me, okay.

1518
01:52:10,913 --> 01:52:16,035
[SPEAKER_16]: The song is called Ways of Love, and the artist is CyberX featuring Jody Watley.

1519
01:52:16,615 --> 01:52:19,736
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's from an album called CyberX, so give this a try.

1520
01:52:19,756 --> 01:52:21,817
[SPEAKER_16]: If you like Avex tracks, you just might like this.

1521
01:52:22,137 --> 01:52:24,838
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Jamie's pick tonight.

1522
01:52:24,878 --> 01:52:27,159
[SPEAKER_16]: CyberX featuring Jody Watley with Waves.

1523
01:53:42,162 --> 01:53:57,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel the waves of love Messages we send Feel the waves of love There's a new horizon With the rising sun We can reach the heavens On the waves of love The waves of love

1524
01:55:43,573 --> 01:55:44,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1525
01:56:26,651 --> 01:56:27,012
All right.

1526
01:56:52,606 --> 01:56:55,392
[SPEAKER_16]: CyberX featuring Jody Watley with Waves of Love.

1527
01:56:55,913 --> 01:56:56,594
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, what'd you think?

1528
01:56:56,614 --> 01:56:58,878
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought it was pretty cool.

1529
01:57:00,561 --> 01:57:01,443
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm upbeat this week.

1530
01:57:01,483 --> 01:57:03,988
[SPEAKER_13]: See, I don't have anything negative to say about those songs.

1531
01:57:04,529 --> 01:57:04,909
[SPEAKER_16]: I give it an 8.

1532
01:57:08,117 --> 01:57:18,562
[SPEAKER_16]: I liked it in the beginning, but it just kind of, I don't know, kind of dragged for me towards the end, but I do typically like most Avex tracks, so I'll be nice and give it seven and a half.

1533
01:57:19,443 --> 01:57:22,344
[SPEAKER_16]: The trance song is supposed to sound the same for like seven minutes.

1534
01:57:22,364 --> 01:57:24,605
[SPEAKER_16]: It's different.

1535
01:57:24,665 --> 01:57:26,046
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't explain it, but it's different.

1536
01:57:26,106 --> 01:57:27,086
[SPEAKER_16]: Just go with it, okay?

1537
01:57:28,127 --> 01:57:33,249
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie sends her vote online, and she says, of course, her song gets a ten for being exciting trance.

1538
01:57:34,570 --> 01:57:37,371
[SPEAKER_16]: Bradley, or Brad, whoever gets the mic first.

1539
01:57:40,612 --> 01:57:41,532
[SPEAKER_16]: Dumbass, dude!

1540
01:57:41,972 --> 01:57:43,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, hold on, I gotta tell you if you're on camera yet.

1541
01:57:45,273 --> 01:57:45,893
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, got it!

1542
01:57:48,033 --> 01:57:48,773
[SPEAKER_13]: It was okay.

1543
01:57:48,833 --> 01:57:50,814
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't going away, so give it a 7.

1544
01:57:50,854 --> 01:57:54,374
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a nice picture of Brad's ass sticking up in the air.

1545
01:58:01,796 --> 01:58:04,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, hold on.

1546
01:58:04,336 --> 01:58:05,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at the webcam, people.

1547
01:58:05,917 --> 01:58:06,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, anyway.

1548
01:58:06,377 --> 01:58:06,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Brad!

1549
01:58:07,537 --> 01:58:07,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1550
01:58:08,658 --> 01:58:13,119
[SPEAKER_10]: I've said before to other people I don't really like trance songs unless it's a Kiriyama Oka, so I'm giving it a 5.

1551
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:15,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh.

1552
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:16,500
[SPEAKER_10]: You're mean.

1553
01:58:16,540 --> 01:58:17,441
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not trying to be mean.

1554
01:58:17,541 --> 01:58:21,222
[SPEAKER_10]: I really, just trance can't really be interesting unless it's a Kiriyama Oka.

1555
01:58:21,242 --> 01:58:22,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, alright.

1556
01:58:22,162 --> 01:58:23,943
[SPEAKER_16]: You're entitled to your opinion, even if it sucks.

1557
01:58:24,183 --> 01:58:24,443
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1558
01:58:26,025 --> 01:58:26,506
[SPEAKER_16]: Here we go.

1559
01:58:27,066 --> 01:58:27,807
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's a recap.

1560
01:58:27,847 --> 01:58:30,750
[SPEAKER_16]: You can send your votes in very soon, but you have to be in the chat room.

1561
01:58:31,110 --> 01:58:31,710
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know what?

1562
01:58:31,790 --> 01:58:34,553
[SPEAKER_16]: Now is a great night to be in our chat room because it's crowded in there.

1563
01:58:34,573 --> 01:58:35,674
[SPEAKER_16]: There's lots of people in there tonight.

1564
01:58:36,355 --> 01:58:38,757
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, why aren't all of you on the stream?

1565
01:58:38,777 --> 01:58:41,960
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I know that there's more people in the chat room than are on the stream.

1566
01:58:42,020 --> 01:58:43,481
[SPEAKER_16]: So shame on you.

1567
01:58:43,501 --> 01:58:44,402
[SPEAKER_16]: Shame on you.

01:58:44,602 --> 01:58:46,144

01:58:48,906 --> 01:58:49,247
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1571
01:58:49,267 --> 01:58:50,788
[SPEAKER_16]: Meet some new people, and we want to meet you.

1572
01:58:50,848 --> 01:58:51,749
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to meet new people tonight.

1573
01:58:52,102 --> 01:58:53,985
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, keep the microphone over there, Brad.

1574
01:58:54,005 --> 01:58:56,027
[SPEAKER_16]: Here you go, you can vote for one of these three songs.

1575
01:58:56,929 --> 01:59:01,335
[SPEAKER_16]: Last week's winner, P1... Hey, shut up.

1576
01:59:02,116 --> 01:59:02,997
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's a recap.

1577
01:59:03,658 --> 01:59:04,619
[SPEAKER_16]: First song you can vote for, P8107.

1578
01:59:17,014 --> 01:59:22,460
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight, Above and Beyond with Far From In Love.

1579
01:59:30,888 --> 01:59:35,773
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, and song number three you can vote for tonight is CyberX featuring Jody Watley with Waves of Love.

1580
01:59:45,448 --> 01:59:46,410
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, there you go.

1581
01:59:46,490 --> 01:59:48,072
[SPEAKER_16]: Place vote now!

1582
01:59:48,472 --> 01:59:51,416
[SPEAKER_16]: Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your vote.

1583
01:59:51,436 --> 01:59:55,862
[SPEAKER_16]: If you don't know how to do that, just ask somebody and they'll tell you how you send a private message to Sky.

1584
01:59:55,922 --> 01:59:57,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Votes made public in the chatroom don't count!

1585
01:59:59,707 --> 02:00:00,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1586
02:00:01,669 --> 02:00:01,910
[SPEAKER_16]: So...

1587
02:00:03,266 --> 02:00:06,527
[SPEAKER_16]: Back to the show while we tally up those votes for cage matches as they come in.

1588
02:00:07,788 --> 02:00:11,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, tell us about this other project you've kind of been working on lately.

1589
02:00:11,930 --> 02:00:12,930
[SPEAKER_16]: You're working on it now.

1590
02:00:12,970 --> 02:00:14,651
[SPEAKER_16]: You've been working on it for a little while.

1591
02:00:14,831 --> 02:00:15,431
[SPEAKER_16]: What's up with this?

1592
02:00:15,471 --> 02:00:20,593
[SPEAKER_16]: You're kind of taking Step Mania modification to the extreme from what I see, no pun intended.

1593
02:00:23,035 --> 02:00:29,017
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I'm just right now, because no one can see this out there in radio land.

1594
02:00:29,737 --> 02:00:30,998
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm making a new banner.

1595
02:00:34,352 --> 02:00:52,219
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been trying to pitch an idea to Keith at Golfland because I've seen it done before where basically you wire a Stepmania PC to a DDR machine and run Stepmania on there.

1596
02:00:52,239 --> 02:00:58,241
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, Stepmania is meant to run as an arcade machine itself because it's got options for credits and all that stuff, so...

1597
02:00:59,466 --> 02:01:07,728
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, that's what I'm doing here in-house with cabinets being built, but I thought, you know, why not do that in an arcade, too?

1598
02:01:08,348 --> 02:01:18,690
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I've been basically looking into licensing rights and what it would cost, you know, because obviously I'm not going to ask Konami for permission, because, no, they're never going to say yes, so we're doing it anyways.

1599
02:01:19,770 --> 02:01:25,251
[SPEAKER_16]: But I've been looking into, like, if, you know, a music artist or something was to come after me, how...

1600
02:01:26,411 --> 02:01:54,126
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, what actual licensing rights we would need, so I checked into it, basically a set mini-based game could be considered a jukebox because it's just, you know, music being played and so it would fall under jukebox license rights, I think I don't know, it's a gray area but it only costs $364 a year to actually legally license it, but if we did all, like, Konami original stuff and just, basically it's going to be, you know, I want to

1601
02:01:55,194 --> 02:01:55,434
[SPEAKER_16]: and so on.

1602
02:02:12,566 --> 02:02:16,748
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I'm gonna do, and right now I'm making a banner for Dance Dance Revolution EX2.

1603
02:02:16,788 --> 02:02:18,769
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I've got right now.

1604
02:02:19,490 --> 02:02:20,690
[SPEAKER_16]: What the hell are you doing?!

1605
02:02:21,191 --> 02:02:22,151
[SPEAKER_16]: You fucking idiot!

1606
02:02:23,012 --> 02:02:26,133
[SPEAKER_16]: Brad making stupid gestures into the camera.

1607
02:02:26,573 --> 02:02:28,294
[SPEAKER_16]: But, yeah, it's going along pretty good.

1608
02:02:28,314 --> 02:02:35,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, the banner looks pretty, you know, official, except it's kind of... Looks like it's kind of squashed vertically, I have to fix that.

1609
02:02:36,499 --> 02:02:36,899
[SPEAKER_15]: But, um...

1610
02:02:41,909 --> 02:02:42,571
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

1611
02:02:55,808 --> 02:02:58,749
[SPEAKER_16]: Right now, the feasibility is probably not going to... It's not going to happen there.

1612
02:02:58,809 --> 02:03:01,190
[SPEAKER_16]: But this is just for my own, you know, machine.

1613
02:03:01,991 --> 02:03:09,174
[SPEAKER_16]: Pretty much... Because if you think about it, I could probably make a better mix than Konami can, so... Why not give it a chance?

1614
02:03:09,234 --> 02:03:11,075
[SPEAKER_16]: And I pose the option to them.

1615
02:03:11,135 --> 02:03:12,215
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm like, look at it.

1616
02:03:12,515 --> 02:03:20,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Pass the initial investment of buying the actual PC, which would pay for itself pretty quickly since DDR machines make a ton of money.

1617
02:03:20,519 --> 02:03:23,380
[SPEAKER_16]: You'd have free upgrades for life on that damn thing, so...

1618
02:03:24,714 --> 02:03:27,677
[SPEAKER_16]: Software upgrades would be easy, but, you know, whatever.

1619
02:03:29,038 --> 02:03:30,199
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's what I've been doing on there.

1620
02:03:32,421 --> 02:03:33,562
[SPEAKER_16]: So you think you're going to get away with it?

1621
02:03:33,643 --> 02:03:42,611
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I realize that you're saying in the end it's probably not going to make it, but let's say it does make it somehow, or you buy an arcade, you win a lottery, buy an arcade, and put this machine in it, you think you'll make it?

1622
02:03:44,707 --> 02:03:58,819
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, they're really the only people that could rain on my parade, if that were to ever happen, would be the people that play the game itself religiously, because they're like, oh, oh my god, you know, that's not an official Konami game, that's a poop bag, you're running out of sim.

1623
02:03:59,099 --> 02:04:12,451
[SPEAKER_16]: But they're looking past, you know, what it actually is, and not just playing it for what it's supposed to be, which is just a game, you know, and if Konami's going to stop making arcade games, you know, the US isn't making arcade games for DDR,

1624
02:04:13,487 --> 02:04:17,470
[SPEAKER_16]: and all these games are getting stagnant in arcades, people are going to go one of two routes.

1625
02:04:17,490 --> 02:04:35,541
[SPEAKER_16]: They're either going to spend $1,500 to buy some hacked bootleg, which is looking like shit, or they're going to run software like this that you can emulate, you know, pretty much, you know, emulate DDR perfectly and have, you know, new features added to it that aren't seen in any of the games.

1626
02:04:36,041 --> 02:04:36,802
[SPEAKER_16]: Plus, you know, you're...

1627
02:04:37,442 --> 02:04:37,822
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura.com

1628
02:04:58,095 --> 02:05:01,078
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're talking like full unlocks here.

1629
02:05:01,098 --> 02:05:03,540
[SPEAKER_16]: 400 songs at least on this mix.

1630
02:05:03,880 --> 02:05:09,404
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, if you put like tons and tons and tons of unlocks on there, people will be playing this game forever.

1631
02:05:09,505 --> 02:05:12,187
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it won't ever, you know, get boring.

1632
02:05:12,227 --> 02:05:14,669
[SPEAKER_16]: If people get bored of a song, put a new song on there.

1633
02:05:15,570 --> 02:05:26,959
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't see what the big deal would be if, I mean, other than, you know, well, Konami not getting credit for it or, you know, if they stop making DDR and you can't buy them anymore, then I guess that would, you know,

1634
02:05:27,782 --> 02:05:32,004
[SPEAKER_15]: Fallen, the main of Abandonware, and, you know, I don't know.

1635
02:05:32,284 --> 02:05:41,888
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, I think, unless, you know, people made it, like, a real big deal about it, you know, and it's not like I'm selling it, you know, we're just, it's a one arcade exclusive thing.

1636
02:05:42,348 --> 02:05:43,868
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't see what the big deal would be.

1637
02:05:46,069 --> 02:05:50,711
[SPEAKER_13]: But, um, we should have never invited him over.

1638
02:05:52,691 --> 02:05:53,171
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1639
02:06:15,146 --> 02:06:20,350
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to talk about DDRXbox for a minute, because there was some news this week about DDRXbox, and that is that it's gone gold.

1640
02:06:20,831 --> 02:06:25,895
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it's not sold a certain amount of copies, but it's finished.

1641
02:06:26,155 --> 02:06:29,497
[SPEAKER_16]: It's in the can, it's done, and it's going to be out November 18th.

1642
02:06:29,898 --> 02:06:35,542
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of interesting, not a lot of knowledge about DDRXbox right now when it comes to songs.

1643
02:06:35,582 --> 02:06:41,327
[SPEAKER_16]: We know that there's going to be a remix of Absolute in it, we know that it has shiny disco balls in it, the quickening...

1644
02:06:41,967 --> 02:06:45,271
[SPEAKER_16]: Castles in the Sky, Mad Blast, I think was another one.

1645
02:06:45,571 --> 02:06:46,232
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that what it's called?

1646
02:06:46,252 --> 02:06:47,813
[SPEAKER_16]: The Dance Maniacs song, Mad Blast?

1647
02:06:50,176 --> 02:06:51,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Mind Parasite.

1648
02:06:51,257 --> 02:06:51,977
[SPEAKER_16]: What's Mad Blast?

1649
02:06:51,997 --> 02:06:52,658
[SPEAKER_16]: What am I thinking of?

1650
02:06:53,459 --> 02:06:54,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I'm thinking of the Car Freaks.

1651
02:06:56,342 --> 02:06:56,902
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah, okay.

1652
02:06:57,683 --> 02:06:57,983
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1653
02:07:05,436 --> 02:07:11,620
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, but there's just not a lot to really talk about right now because they haven't been releasing a whole lot of information really.

1654
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:13,821
[SPEAKER_16]: They've all been just kind of working on it.

1655
02:07:14,682 --> 02:07:19,685
[SPEAKER_16]: The anticipation from what I feel is not quite as big as it is for a typical PlayStation release.

1656
02:07:19,705 --> 02:07:26,089
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if people are just scared because it's different or whatever, or maybe just because the marketing hasn't kicked in yet, but I don't know.

1657
02:07:26,109 --> 02:07:27,890
[SPEAKER_16]: There just doesn't seem to be a lot of excitement about it.

1658
02:07:27,930 --> 02:07:28,210
[SPEAKER_16]: I just...

1659
02:07:29,685 --> 02:07:43,458
[SPEAKER_16]: Wouldn't it be interesting if this did well, that maybe Konami of Hawaii were to put together some new arcade release with their brand new interface they've done and their more competitive DDR-ness they have in there and all that stuff?

1660
02:07:45,900 --> 02:07:47,822
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have something to add to this conversation?

1661
02:07:48,283 --> 02:07:51,726
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how I said Merry Christmas in Hawaiian.

1662
02:07:52,427 --> 02:07:53,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Something like that.

1663
02:07:57,264 --> 02:07:59,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you fucking talk about something worthwhile, Rob?

1664
02:08:00,525 --> 02:08:02,145
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait, you don't think Xbox is worthwhile?

1665
02:08:02,425 --> 02:08:02,725
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1666
02:08:03,125 --> 02:08:03,605
[SPEAKER_16]: Why not?

1667
02:08:03,825 --> 02:08:04,325
[SPEAKER_16]: Xbox.

1668
02:08:05,686 --> 02:08:06,486
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what, though?

1669
02:08:06,546 --> 02:08:20,929
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of folks that, you know... Yeah, those are the same people who... play sports games, like football, outside, where there's bears.

1670
02:08:20,969 --> 02:08:21,229
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1671
02:08:21,809 --> 02:08:21,889
[SPEAKER_16]: Um...

1672
02:08:23,115 --> 02:08:29,918
[SPEAKER_16]: The only other songs we know, other than those we just mentioned, Colors by DJ Taka from Xtreme is going to show up.

1673
02:08:30,378 --> 02:08:32,318
[SPEAKER_16]: And Sugaru, Revenge vs. Desire.

1674
02:08:32,338 --> 02:08:35,900
[SPEAKER_16]: And then there were a few more from some list I saw, but I don't remember it.

1675
02:08:36,080 --> 02:08:37,160
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's that.

1676
02:08:37,220 --> 02:08:41,462
[SPEAKER_16]: We have not had an official song list come out from Konami.

1677
02:08:41,622 --> 02:08:42,202
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the point.

1678
02:08:42,542 --> 02:08:49,545
[SPEAKER_16]: But now that the game's gone gold, maybe they'll send some kind of... I don't know.

1679
02:08:50,085 --> 02:08:50,665
[SPEAKER_16]: They'll do something.

1680
02:08:52,034 --> 02:09:02,788
[SPEAKER_16]: Mecha Lecha Hi, Mecha Heidi Ho Alright, let's get to tonight's cage match winner Mecha Lecha Hi, Mecha Johnny Ho Tonight's cage match winner, ladies and gentlemen, is It's a tie

1681
02:09:05,575 --> 02:09:05,775
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

1682
02:09:06,535 --> 02:09:07,095
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a tie.

1683
02:09:07,255 --> 02:09:07,775
[SPEAKER_16]: Between who?

1684
02:09:07,815 --> 02:09:08,456
[SPEAKER_16]: So who wins?

1685
02:09:08,936 --> 02:09:09,876
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is how we do it.

1686
02:09:10,236 --> 02:09:11,736
[SPEAKER_16]: Because the one song that didn't tie.

1687
02:09:11,756 --> 02:09:12,797
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the interesting thing.

1688
02:09:12,897 --> 02:09:14,397
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a tie by one vote.

1689
02:09:14,737 --> 02:09:17,818
[SPEAKER_16]: If one person had voted for the other song, it would have been a three-way tie.

1690
02:09:18,418 --> 02:09:19,878
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was very close tonight.

1691
02:09:19,958 --> 02:09:20,698
[SPEAKER_16]: Ooh, a three-way.

1692
02:09:20,798 --> 02:09:21,799
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, ooh, a three-way.

1693
02:09:22,279 --> 02:09:23,819
[SPEAKER_16]: So, here we go.

1694
02:09:24,739 --> 02:09:27,060
[SPEAKER_16]: The two songs that tied tonight were last week's winner, P8107.

1695
02:09:32,851 --> 02:09:37,177
[SPEAKER_16]: And the second song that tied tonight was Above and Beyond with Far From the Love.

1696
02:09:39,961 --> 02:09:43,686
[SPEAKER_16]: And CyberX and Jody Watley was one vote away.

1697
02:09:44,927 --> 02:09:48,348
[SPEAKER_16]: So, that means DarkSakura gets to pick who wins?

1698
02:09:48,368 --> 02:09:54,209
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right, because the rules say the host whose song didn't win gets to break the tie.

1699
02:09:54,269 --> 02:09:55,949
[SPEAKER_16]: But she's not here, what do we do?

1700
02:09:56,109 --> 02:10:00,830
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, but she is here in spirit, she's in the chat room, so I'm going to ask her to send her vote along.

1701
02:10:01,310 --> 02:10:05,051
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll find out who won the cage match after the break.

1702
02:10:05,291 --> 02:10:08,332
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to give her the break to deliberate and send her vote if she wants.

1703
02:10:08,372 --> 02:10:10,292
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, never mind, she's already sent it, so let's see.

1704
02:10:11,913 --> 02:10:12,493
[SPEAKER_16]: And the winner is...

1705
02:10:14,673 --> 02:10:18,435
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie has voted for Far From In Love.

1706
02:10:18,615 --> 02:10:20,016
[SPEAKER_16]: So that is the winner for tonight.

1707
02:10:25,436 --> 02:10:27,458
[SPEAKER_16]: in a very, very close, probably the closest cage match yet.

1708
02:10:27,978 --> 02:10:30,920
[SPEAKER_16]: I demand a re- Yeah, we're going to have a re-call now.

1709
02:10:30,940 --> 02:10:31,701
[SPEAKER_16]: A re-count.

1710
02:10:32,421 --> 02:10:33,802
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all your chads, people.

1711
02:10:34,083 --> 02:10:34,643
[SPEAKER_16]: Make sure you puncture.

1712
02:10:34,663 --> 02:10:36,585
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki's song already won two weeks in a row.

1713
02:10:36,605 --> 02:10:37,665
[SPEAKER_16]: It was time for it to go.

1714
02:10:38,206 --> 02:10:38,746
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever, dude.

1715
02:10:38,766 --> 02:10:42,949
[SPEAKER_16]: He wants to do a new song next week anyway, and she says, eat trance.

1716
02:10:43,530 --> 02:10:46,372
[SPEAKER_16]: When she voted for it, she said, eat trance.

1717
02:10:47,092 --> 02:10:47,713
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not laughing.

1718
02:10:50,839 --> 02:10:51,179
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1719
02:10:52,719 --> 02:10:53,280
[SPEAKER_16]: There you go.

1720
02:10:53,380 --> 02:10:57,640
[SPEAKER_16]: That's tonight's Winter of the Cage match and goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lock Radio.

1721
02:10:57,660 --> 02:10:59,561
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to do a break now.

1722
02:10:59,581 --> 02:11:01,581
[SPEAKER_16]: You'd like to fuck my recount, wouldn't you?

1723
02:11:05,522 --> 02:11:10,463
[SPEAKER_16]: When we come back from this little break of music, we're going to do the FUs of the week.

1724
02:11:10,563 --> 02:11:12,684
[SPEAKER_16]: So send those over private message to me.

1725
02:11:12,804 --> 02:11:18,045
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, I'm Sky and I'm in the chat room and I'm just waiting to hear your FUs because we're going to read them very soon.

1726
02:11:18,085 --> 02:11:18,625
[SPEAKER_16]: In the meantime...

1727
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:20,904
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's do a break of music.

1728
02:11:21,004 --> 02:11:22,488
[SPEAKER_16]: Start it off with a little bit of Xenon.

1729
02:11:24,553 --> 02:11:25,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Xenon

1730
02:12:09,058 --> 02:12:10,219

Thank you for watching!

1734
02:17:10,111 --> 02:17:15,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge Bay Money Music and More show?

1735
02:17:16,054 --> 02:17:23,198
[SPEAKER_12]: The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

1736
02:17:23,518 --> 02:17:25,519
[SPEAKER_12]: It's unearthly.

1737
02:17:25,739 --> 02:17:29,481
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

1738
02:17:30,061 --> 02:17:33,984
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 65 in progress.

1739
02:17:34,544 --> 02:17:36,685
[SPEAKER_16]: And Dark Sakura's out sick tonight, unfortunately.

1740
02:17:36,725 --> 02:17:38,526
[SPEAKER_16]: We wish her she gets better soon.

1741
02:17:39,537 --> 02:18:07,808
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Lounge Radio, music you hump to Thank you Also, Loki and I are sick, but somehow we're continuing to go on I think Loki's not quite as bad off as either Jamie or myself And I'm probably not as bad off as Jamie I talked to her on the phone earlier, she sounded pretty bad So, I'm somehow faking my way through this show tonight Joining me tonight, LankyStyle, over there, hello Baka's complaining there's nothing in the webcam, so I have to go back to my crazy antics No, no, Baka, shut up And Arcadian42's here too

1742

[SPEAKER_16]: Yo.

[SPEAKER_16]: Yo.

1744
02:18:32,936 --> 02:18:39,400
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's got, basically, it looks exactly like DDR Extreme, except it's blue in the background.

1745
02:18:39,580 --> 02:18:43,163
[SPEAKER_16]: And I say blue in the background, you know where there'd be green checkers?

1746
02:18:43,543 --> 02:18:44,704
[SPEAKER_15]: Now it's just solid blue.

1747
02:18:45,945 --> 02:18:46,825
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is lame.

1748
02:18:47,486 --> 02:18:52,389
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's what it is, and then the, it's like they didn't really know what they were doing when they made it.

1749
02:18:53,309 --> 02:18:56,612
[SPEAKER_16]: And, I don't know, it's just, it's pretty lame.

1750
02:18:58,493 --> 02:19:01,595
[SPEAKER_16]: And according to this, there's not really any new songs, it looks like, I don't know.

1751
02:19:05,055 --> 02:19:08,456
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, as promised, now it's time to get into the FUs of the week.

1752
02:19:08,756 --> 02:19:13,997
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're going to start off with Jamie's FUs, even though she's not here, we do have her FUs, so let's start.

1753
02:19:19,919 --> 02:19:21,799
[SPEAKER_17]: Here is justice.

1754
02:19:21,839 --> 02:19:23,780
[SPEAKER_17]: Here is justice.

1755
02:19:30,599 --> 02:19:32,742
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to stupid people on Ragnarok Online.

1756
02:19:32,782 --> 02:19:33,583
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1757
02:19:33,603 --> 02:19:34,564
[SPEAKER_16]: She has real F yous.

[SPEAKER_16]: Here they are.

1759
02:19:36,366 --> 02:19:43,074
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura would like to say F you to being sick and that I can't take off work because of my impending trip to Alabama.

1760
02:19:44,236 --> 02:19:45,898
[SPEAKER_16]: F you number two is missing the show.

1761
02:19:46,639 --> 02:19:48,841
[SPEAKER_16]: F you number three is not having toilet paper.

1762
02:19:50,437 --> 02:19:52,038
[SPEAKER_16]: That must be an interesting house right now.

1763
02:19:52,078 --> 02:19:52,979
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we've got plenty.

1764
02:19:53,439 --> 02:19:55,040
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie, you should have come over.

1765
02:19:55,060 --> 02:19:55,720
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got plenty.

1766
02:19:55,761 --> 02:20:03,105
[SPEAKER_16]: We bought like 50 gazillion packs in one at Ralph's.

1767
02:20:03,285 --> 02:20:05,567
[SPEAKER_16]: FU number four, my nose is rubbed raw.

1768
02:20:07,048 --> 02:20:09,429
[SPEAKER_16]: FU number five, not having good food at home.

1769
02:20:10,990 --> 02:20:11,931
[SPEAKER_16]: FU to being hot.

1770
02:20:12,891 --> 02:20:15,533
[SPEAKER_16]: FU to people who don't pay enough attention to the world around them.

1771
02:20:16,600 --> 02:20:21,583
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to selfish frivolity, I'm guilty of the same, and not being able to save money.

1772
02:20:22,823 --> 02:20:28,386
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to bad grammar and spelling, and lastly, F you number 10 from DarkSakura, F you to idiots.

1773
02:20:30,047 --> 02:20:31,588
[SPEAKER_16]: Zelda, more like Zelda.

1774
02:20:33,689 --> 02:20:34,089
[SPEAKER_16]: Shut up.

1775
02:20:34,670 --> 02:20:36,751
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, Loki's turn, your F yous.

1776
02:20:41,489 --> 02:20:46,031
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to Sacramento, because I don't like you at all.

1777
02:20:47,031 --> 02:20:52,533
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, I really, really, really, really, really hate downtown Sac, because every time I drive down there, I get lost.

1778
02:20:53,053 --> 02:20:55,494
[SPEAKER_16]: Because all their streets go one way, and it sucks.

1779
02:20:55,694 --> 02:20:58,295
[SPEAKER_16]: And they don't label their streets, and they have them all messed up.

1780
02:20:58,915 --> 02:20:59,375
[SPEAKER_13]: It just sucks.

1781
02:20:59,435 --> 02:21:00,896
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can't find food down there.

1782
02:21:01,956 --> 02:21:03,237
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate downtown Sac.

1783
02:21:03,497 --> 02:21:04,897
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're making me drive down there.

1784
02:21:05,538 --> 02:21:06,178
[SPEAKER_13]: And it sucks.

1785
02:21:08,098 --> 02:21:17,181
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to Fox News Because, actually F you to any 24 hour news channel Because you covered the same story 50,000 times You know why?

1786
02:21:17,801 --> 02:21:26,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Because actual news doesn't happen Or actual interesting news doesn't happen all the time So why do they even have 24 hour news networks in the first place?

1787
02:21:27,724 --> 02:21:31,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Since you're just covering the same shit over and over and over again Why not just cover it once?

1788
02:21:32,856 --> 02:21:35,177
[SPEAKER_16]: at the normal news time like ordinary news works.

1789
02:21:35,277 --> 02:21:39,759
[SPEAKER_16]: So basically, point for our news networks are useless.

1790
02:21:40,860 --> 02:21:44,261
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, FUG4 because they're just lame.

1791
02:21:46,302 --> 02:21:47,663
[SPEAKER_16]: FUG Brad because he's an idiot.

1792
02:21:48,163 --> 02:21:54,766
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, also, um, that's so distracting.

1793
02:21:55,867 --> 02:21:56,807
[SPEAKER_13]: Stop jumping!

1794
02:21:58,168 --> 02:21:58,808
[SPEAKER_13]: God damn it.

1795
02:22:00,592 --> 02:22:06,896
[SPEAKER_13]: F you to my cold, because now not only am I sick, but I have to go to jury duty, and that still sucks.

1796
02:22:07,577 --> 02:22:10,639
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to jury duty, because I really don't like it.

1797
02:22:11,619 --> 02:22:19,224
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, I honestly, I don't like people that much, so I didn't really want to be there in the first place.

1798
02:22:19,484 --> 02:22:23,047
[SPEAKER_13]: And people waiting out in front of jury duty always have something stupid to say.

1799
02:22:24,168 --> 02:22:28,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I have to listen to this woman talk about how the water treatment plant works.

1800
02:22:28,370 --> 02:22:29,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I really care.

1801
02:22:29,881 --> 02:22:30,502
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't.

1802
02:22:31,002 --> 02:22:38,630
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just like, he keeps blabbing on about it over and over, and there's some guy that works with B, and just, ugh, can't wait for the B over with.

1803
02:22:42,154 --> 02:22:46,259
[SPEAKER_16]: And finally, put the damn coin door down!

1804
02:22:46,599 --> 02:22:48,341
[SPEAKER_16]: That's way across the line, buddy.

1805
02:22:52,438 --> 02:22:52,778
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, no.

1806
02:22:53,059 --> 02:22:59,163
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I was more... If we'd done the FUs on Wednesday, it would have been so much better, because I came in just angry as hell.

1807
02:22:59,863 --> 02:23:03,405
[SPEAKER_16]: I have that bit taped, so I can play it later in the future if you want.

1808
02:23:04,606 --> 02:23:04,986
[SPEAKER_16]: Sweet.

1809
02:23:06,587 --> 02:23:11,331
[SPEAKER_16]: No, but I'm just like... It sucks because now I'm not angsty on the weekends.

1810
02:23:11,391 --> 02:23:14,132
[SPEAKER_16]: I just kind of relax by the time Sunday comes around, you know?

1811
02:23:14,533 --> 02:23:15,794
[SPEAKER_16]: So I was angry at first.

1812
02:23:15,834 --> 02:23:17,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, I was totally pissed off about the whole, like,

1813
02:23:18,869 --> 02:23:24,291
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, jury duty thing, but now I'm just kind of like calm, you know, I'm ready for it tomorrow, because it's not that bad.

1814
02:23:24,911 --> 02:23:28,312
[SPEAKER_16]: But, I don't know what the hell he's doing.

1815
02:23:28,332 --> 02:23:36,894
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to the fact that they didn't get to go out to go all-flanks, they really wanted to, and, you know, circumstances prevented that, so, oh well.

1816
02:23:38,674 --> 02:23:39,155
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm done.

1817
02:23:40,895 --> 02:23:41,335
[SPEAKER_16]: My turn.

1818
02:23:42,235 --> 02:23:47,917
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, my biggest F you this week, obviously, is being sick, because when you're sick, you don't feel like doing shit.

1819
02:23:52,596 --> 02:24:17,831
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to my friend who went out to the bar with me, Ice Princess F you to Ice Princess for being a drunken fucker on Friday night and he was being the biggest bitch ever and he was an hour and a half late to the club and no I'm not going to get over it because you suck you made me wait at the bar for an hour and a half for you and ugly old people were hitting on me and therefore you should be punished and I'm going to berate you to this forever and F you for getting drunk and

02:24:22,491 --> 02:24:24,893
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, let's move on, that's it.

1822
02:24:26,894 --> 02:24:28,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, Bradley, do you have a mic over there?

1823
02:24:30,797 --> 02:24:31,937
[SPEAKER_16]: Brad or Bradley, somebody.

02:24:34,679 --> 02:24:35,599
[SPEAKER_16]: Bradley's trying to get a mic.

1825
02:24:38,621 --> 02:24:42,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh... Fuck you to... Dial-up?

1826
02:24:43,665 --> 02:24:43,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck you.

02:24:50,852 --> 02:24:53,953
[SPEAKER_09]: The Bad Room is back with a pH 4.

1828
02:24:54,573 --> 02:24:59,474

[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, very well.

1831
02:25:02,814 --> 02:25:08,396
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking to sell stuff, but actually that's part of the good thing to sell stuff because I got too much crap as it is.

1832
02:25:08,476 --> 02:25:10,536
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have to look at or use.

1833
02:25:10,696 --> 02:25:12,336
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to get rid of some of this.

1834
02:25:13,977 --> 02:25:15,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, fuck you to truck drivers.

1835
02:25:15,837 --> 02:25:16,817

1839
02:25:30,707 --> 02:25:31,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, let's see, what else?

1840
02:25:31,807 --> 02:25:32,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else?

02:25:33,228 --> 02:25:36,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, fuck you, they don't have any chips to eat.

02:25:41,069 --> 02:25:43,890
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can have something to drink in the morning other than water.

1844
02:25:43,990 --> 02:25:46,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Or something that's hot.

1845
02:25:48,191 --> 02:25:48,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

1846
02:26:03,150 --> 02:26:04,671

[SPEAKER_12]: FU to the FU segment.

1851
02:26:14,780 --> 02:26:16,981
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't like it.

02:26:17,082 --> 02:26:17,462
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

02:26:20,877 --> 02:26:21,817
[SPEAKER_11]: A random fuck you.

[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1857
02:26:23,537 --> 02:26:25,618

1858
02:26:26,078 --> 02:26:27,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though I haven't had one in a long time.

1859
02:26:28,738 --> 02:26:31,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Stouffer's, like, TV dinner type things, they suck.

1860
02:26:31,859 --> 02:26:37,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially compared to, like, Mary Colander's, which is... They're on sale, like, three out of every four weeks.

1861
02:26:37,881 --> 02:26:39,141
[SPEAKER_11]: And are generally pretty good.

1862
02:26:40,041 --> 02:26:48,023
[SPEAKER_11]: And, like, twice as good, twice, three times as good as those crappy pieces of shit that Stouffer's tries to pawn off on people.

1863
02:26:48,618 --> 02:26:49,939
[SPEAKER_11]: for three, four bucks.

1864
02:26:51,020 --> 02:26:52,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck you and your shitty meals.

1865
02:26:52,501 --> 02:26:54,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, that was stupid.

1866
02:26:55,543 --> 02:26:56,764
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm in the bedroom.

1867
02:26:56,964 --> 02:26:57,365
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all good.

1868
02:26:57,945 --> 02:26:59,286
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, I'm in the chatroom, FUs.

1869
02:27:04,150 --> 02:27:09,393
[SPEAKER_16]: Zodiac Knight says, I'd like to send an FU to myself if that's possible.

1870
02:27:10,795 --> 02:27:11,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't be so hard on yourself.

1871
02:27:11,935 --> 02:27:12,496

1875
02:27:53,103 --> 02:27:56,824
[SPEAKER_16]: And F you to the cocky bastards who think they know everything in billiards when they actually suck.

[SPEAKER_16]: Can I respond to that, Loki?

1881
02:28:12,739 --> 02:28:17,921
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the segment was called Effie of the Week, you know, because that's where you bitch.

1882
02:28:18,521 --> 02:28:20,501
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, it's just a thought.

1883
02:28:21,562 --> 02:28:22,422
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not always bitch.

1884
02:28:22,442 --> 02:28:23,882
[SPEAKER_16]: I haven't been bitching today.

1885
02:28:23,902 --> 02:28:25,203
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been good.

1886
02:28:25,503 --> 02:28:27,003
[SPEAKER_16]: You've been pretty good, I'll give you that.

[SPEAKER_16]: I bought actual rice today.

1890
02:28:36,266 --> 02:28:40,167
[SPEAKER_16]: So there, for all those people that said I cook with minute rice, you can suck it.

1891
02:28:41,451 --> 02:28:41,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you done?

1892
02:28:41,911 --> 02:28:42,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you spent?

1893
02:28:42,993 --> 02:28:45,995
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's just, you know, fulfilling the bitching part.

02:28:46,416 --> 02:28:51,280
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, F you the fact that my printer didn't come with the appropriate USB cable to hook it up.

1986
02:36:41,255 --> 02:36:44,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami.

1987
02:36:44,158 --> 02:36:49,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you all know Beat Media, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.

1988
02:36:50,584 --> 02:36:53,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen carefully and try to follow.

1989
02:36:54,067 --> 02:36:57,670
[SPEAKER_04]: The objects will come down from the top when it hits the red line.

1990
02:37:03,217 --> 02:37:04,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn the table!

1991
02:37:04,961 --> 02:37:05,742
[SPEAKER_04]: You get it?

1992
02:37:06,103 --> 02:37:07,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's practice!

1993
02:37:09,109 --> 02:37:11,093
[SPEAKER_03]: First, hit the white keys!

1994
02:37:40,227 --> 02:37:41,010
Thank you for watching!

1995
02:38:15,068 --> 02:38:17,449
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard, but you can do it!

1996
02:38:17,469 --> 02:38:19,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's exercise!

1997
02:38:20,111 --> 02:38:21,992
Here's the spec of the new Pikminya!

1998
02:39:14,236 --> 02:39:15,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1999
02:39:44,495 --> 02:39:45,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

2000
02:40:05,987 --> 02:40:07,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Bitch, get a new song.

2001
02:40:08,388 --> 02:40:10,870
[SPEAKER_08]: An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

2002
02:40:11,210 --> 02:40:12,931
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

2003
02:40:13,491 --> 02:40:15,072
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to do Ask Orange Lounge here in a little bit.

2004
02:40:15,112 --> 02:40:19,114
[SPEAKER_16]: We got a ton of freaking questions tonight, so we're going to address all your questions.

2005
02:40:20,024 --> 02:40:25,630
[SPEAKER_16]: But first off, I just wanted to say, before the break, I said that there's stuff you can do to help Bomani out right now.

2006
02:40:25,710 --> 02:40:27,091
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a couple things.

2007
02:40:27,171 --> 02:40:36,941
[SPEAKER_16]: First off, 2DX Consumer Style, the new one, at last count, they have about almost just shy of 9,000 responses.

2008
02:40:37,201 --> 02:40:37,782
[SPEAKER_16]: And they only need 10,000.

2009
02:40:38,342 --> 02:40:41,826
[SPEAKER_16]: So in the next nine days, they're going to need 1,000 more responses.

2010
02:40:41,926 --> 02:40:43,748
[SPEAKER_16]: So if we can, you know...

2011
02:40:45,151 --> 02:40:49,552
[SPEAKER_16]: If all the listeners can get in on that, then we'll have it down to a good 998.

2012
02:40:49,692 --> 02:40:53,594
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's five days from now, like the 24th.

2013
02:40:54,414 --> 02:40:54,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it?

2014
02:40:55,034 --> 02:40:55,934
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's the 24th.

2015
02:40:55,954 --> 02:40:58,155
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever, I did my math wrong, so whatever.

2016
02:40:59,315 --> 02:41:03,357
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's not a lot of time left, so get your ass over to KonamiStyle and sign that.

2017
02:41:03,677 --> 02:41:08,558
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have a direct URL for it, sorry guys, but maybe somebody in the chat room will be kind enough to post one.

2018
02:41:08,638 --> 02:41:11,339
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura probably has more than there was like a week, five days ago.

2019
02:41:15,877 --> 02:41:19,058
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a direct link on Bomani Style somewhere, so look for that.

2020
02:41:19,118 --> 02:41:30,921
[SPEAKER_16]: Speaking of Bomani Style, the other thing I was going to say is that they are going to be distributing TAC's new CD, Bounce Connected, but they need to get, I think, about 200 orders for it, and they only have about 75 right now, I think, when I did the math.

2021
02:41:31,281 --> 02:41:31,461
[SPEAKER_16]: Was it...

2022
02:41:32,938 --> 02:41:35,760
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I thought it was 25 paid and then 50 reserved.

2023
02:41:36,120 --> 02:41:37,641
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought it was plus 75.

2024
02:41:38,282 --> 02:41:42,565
[SPEAKER_16]: But still, if you guys are interested in picking up Bounce Connected, head on to Bomani Style.

2025
02:41:42,605 --> 02:41:45,026
[SPEAKER_16]: It's right on the top of their page in the bottom left.

2026
02:41:45,326 --> 02:41:48,629
[SPEAKER_16]: And tell them Orange Lounge Radio sent you so they'll think we're cool.

2027
02:41:49,449 --> 02:41:56,330
[SPEAKER_15]: And also, after they get Bounce Connected ordered up, they're going to order more CDs from diverse systems.

2028
02:41:56,871 --> 02:42:00,451
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the CDs called Hello Boss features P8107.

2029
02:42:01,151 --> 02:42:12,414
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, that's definitely a CD you're going to want to check out because it's got a ton of awesome remixes by the Japanese artists who are a lot better at remixing Bomani music than the American artists will ever be.

2030
02:42:13,114 --> 02:42:13,594
[SPEAKER_16]: So, ha!

2031
02:42:13,674 --> 02:42:14,214
[SPEAKER_16]: Eat that!

2032
02:42:15,094 --> 02:42:18,075
[SPEAKER_16]: And yes, I do admit they are way better than I am, so...

2033
02:42:22,295 --> 02:42:24,036
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, so that's what you can do to help Bomani out.

2034
02:42:24,076 --> 02:42:25,996
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's do some Ask Orange Lounge.

2035
02:42:31,899 --> 02:42:33,180
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's Ask Orange Lounge.

2036
02:42:33,740 --> 02:42:34,901
[SPEAKER_16]: Some stupid question.

2037
02:42:35,581 --> 02:42:37,722
[SPEAKER_16]: Baba, I'm not singing because I'm sick, so fuck off.

2038
02:42:37,842 --> 02:42:38,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

2039
02:42:39,323 --> 02:42:42,544
[SPEAKER_16]: Ask some questions.

2040
02:42:42,564 --> 02:42:43,365
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to sing, Bradley?

2041
02:42:43,405 --> 02:42:43,865
[SPEAKER_16]: Go for it.

2042
02:42:45,125 --> 02:42:46,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2043
02:42:46,826 --> 02:42:48,247
[SPEAKER_16]: ViolentHyperGirl would like to know,

2044
02:42:49,744 --> 02:42:56,670
[SPEAKER_16]: My friend Danny, who said Loki bitches too much, wants to know why you guys don't have better quality radio.

2045
02:42:57,931 --> 02:42:59,372
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if he means sound-wise.

2046
02:42:59,412 --> 02:43:02,415
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're talking about sound quality, that's because we're staying modem-friendly.

2047
02:43:03,176 --> 02:43:06,879
[SPEAKER_16]: We want modem listeners to be able to access our station because they've supported us since the beginning.

2048
02:43:08,260 --> 02:43:14,145
[SPEAKER_16]: But next month, we're going to go MP3 Pro, which means even if you're on a modem, you can still get DSL-quality sound.

2049
02:43:14,165 --> 02:43:14,846
[SPEAKER_16]: That's going to be exciting.

2050
02:43:15,509 --> 02:43:17,330
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I forgot to mention something about FUs.

2051
02:43:17,470 --> 02:43:26,733
[SPEAKER_15]: I know this is totally, like, past that segment, but FUs to that stupid Modesto Mitsubishi commercial that lasted a good half hour.

2052
02:43:27,833 --> 02:43:30,094
[SPEAKER_15]: You suck, and that crazy Mexican guy's funny.

2053
02:43:30,874 --> 02:43:32,815
[SPEAKER_15]: And that put that segue into this.

2054
02:43:33,255 --> 02:43:40,098
[SPEAKER_16]: This is why we don't put quality radio out there, because irritating radio stays with you longer than, you know, quality radio.

2055
02:43:40,738 --> 02:43:41,878
[SPEAKER_16]: Quality radio gets forgotten.

2056
02:43:42,038 --> 02:43:43,759
[SPEAKER_16]: Irritating radio stays with you.

2057
02:43:46,027 --> 02:43:46,808
[SPEAKER_16]: I just took a piss.

2058
02:43:48,189 --> 02:43:48,629
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

2059
02:43:51,151 --> 02:43:55,394
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, if you don't like our station, I challenge you to do something better.

2060
02:43:57,075 --> 02:43:57,316
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

2061
02:43:57,336 --> 02:43:58,797
[SPEAKER_16]: Or the easy way, just fuck yourself.

2062
02:44:02,119 --> 02:44:05,422
[SPEAKER_16]: But I know that's not what you meant, so hugs and kisses from you to me.

2063
02:44:06,042 --> 02:44:06,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Or from me to you.

2064
02:44:07,223 --> 02:44:09,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on, who was the one who had the question?

2065
02:44:09,745 --> 02:44:10,946
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, one of ViolentHyperGirl's friends.

2066
02:44:11,606 --> 02:44:11,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

2067
02:44:12,347 --> 02:44:14,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry I don't know you, I don't want to be mean or anything, but fuck yourself.

2068
02:44:17,719 --> 02:44:20,280
[SPEAKER_16]: My other friend wants to know the purpose of Orange Lounge Radio.

2069
02:44:20,320 --> 02:44:24,202
[SPEAKER_16]: The purpose of Orange Lounge Radio is so that we can make asses of ourselves on the internet.

2070
02:44:26,463 --> 02:44:28,884
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's to entertain ourselves and not you, so fuck off.

2071
02:44:31,326 --> 02:44:31,966
[SPEAKER_16]: Just kidding.

2072
02:44:32,246 --> 02:44:33,587
[SPEAKER_16]: Nothing but love for all you.

2073
02:44:34,647 --> 02:44:35,528
[SPEAKER_16]: Especially new people.

2074
02:44:38,910 --> 02:44:43,312
[SPEAKER_16]: ViolentHapperGirl also wants to know, when will the next mass Orange Lounge Radio or GB?

2075
02:44:43,372 --> 02:44:45,173
[SPEAKER_16]: And if it's happening soon, will you need my whip?

2076
02:44:45,956 --> 02:44:46,957
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know and yes.

2077
02:44:47,297 --> 02:44:48,918
[SPEAKER_16]: Probably whenever the next big tournament is.

2078
02:44:49,138 --> 02:44:51,460
[SPEAKER_16]: Although not that one the day after Halloween because I'll be out of town.

2079
02:44:51,500 --> 02:44:52,601
[SPEAKER_16]: So no orgies without me.

2080
02:44:54,082 --> 02:44:54,382
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

2081
02:44:56,964 --> 02:44:57,465
[SPEAKER_16]: Moving on.

2082
02:44:58,025 --> 02:44:59,506
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura sent in a question.

2083
02:45:01,328 --> 02:45:01,828
[SPEAKER_16]: Here we go.

2084
02:45:02,148 --> 02:45:06,091
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura wants to know, Dear Orange Lounge, why is DarkSakura so fucking rad?

2085
02:45:07,952 --> 02:45:09,574
[SPEAKER_16]: Because she's a chick that plays video games.

2086
02:45:12,315 --> 02:45:13,036
[SPEAKER_16]: Sky, do you enjoy saying my nick?

2087
02:45:13,096 --> 02:45:13,636
[SPEAKER_16]: You always seem to...

2088
02:45:32,162 --> 02:45:32,803
[SPEAKER_16]: It's 915 and 72 degrees.

2089
02:45:47,256 --> 02:45:48,216
[SPEAKER_16]: In the Sacramento area

2090
02:46:20,327 --> 02:46:24,009
[SPEAKER_16]: Nins would also like to know, Tuesday is coming, did you bring your coat?

2091
02:46:26,750 --> 02:46:27,910
[SPEAKER_16]: It's from Rejected.

2092
02:46:28,691 --> 02:46:29,031
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway.

2093
02:46:29,851 --> 02:46:32,853
[SPEAKER_16]: Tee hee, Tee hee hee, Rejected joke.

2094
02:46:33,793 --> 02:46:41,737
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello and welcome to last week.

2095
02:46:41,897 --> 02:46:45,078
[SPEAKER_16]: 23rd Magus would like to know, where can I find a good international lawyer?

2096
02:46:45,499 --> 02:46:48,540
[SPEAKER_16]: I need to crack down on these illegal Portuguese joke book makers.

2097
02:46:51,849 --> 02:46:52,489
[SPEAKER_16]: Moving on!

2098
02:46:53,289 --> 02:46:53,550
[SPEAKER_16]: Huh?

2099
02:46:54,070 --> 02:46:57,731
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, the dead silence reflects everyone everywhere in the response to that segment.

2100
02:46:58,171 --> 02:46:59,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I totally wasn't paying attention.

2101
02:47:00,552 --> 02:47:05,273
[SPEAKER_16]: The Orange Lounge Madam, Pixie Dust, or Penée Princess, as she'd like to be called tonight.

2102
02:47:05,733 --> 02:47:07,494
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, here's a real question for Loki.

2103
02:47:07,514 --> 02:47:08,054
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not Penée.

2104
02:47:09,015 --> 02:47:14,019
[SPEAKER_16]: P9 I like saying PNA because it sounds like TNA, which is what Pixie Dust makes me think of.

2105
02:47:15,821 --> 02:47:16,622
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's a question.

2106
02:47:17,222 --> 02:47:21,446
[SPEAKER_16]: Why does Loki make fun of the fact that my FU goes to me having big tits?

2107
02:47:21,806 --> 02:47:24,969
[SPEAKER_16]: You try having big boobs for a week and see how cheap you feel.

2108
02:47:29,693 --> 02:47:31,415
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't even know how to respond to this.

2109
02:47:31,775 --> 02:47:33,337
[SPEAKER_16]: What are you talking about?

2110
02:47:33,357 --> 02:47:34,458
[SPEAKER_16]: He has big boobs.

2111
02:47:36,004 --> 02:47:37,125
[SPEAKER_16]: He has big man boobs.

2112
02:47:37,405 --> 02:47:42,291
[SPEAKER_16]: I have nice sized breasts, but those are all my girlfriends, so you know.

2113
02:47:42,591 --> 02:47:43,412
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, there you go.

2114
02:47:44,213 --> 02:47:44,733
[SPEAKER_16]: There you go.

2115
02:47:45,674 --> 02:47:46,795
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't feel cheap at all.

2116
02:47:47,616 --> 02:47:47,936
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

2117
02:47:49,518 --> 02:47:53,142
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what I say is, use what you got.

2118
02:47:54,835 --> 02:47:57,778
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going back to some violent hypergirl questions here because she said a bunch.

2119
02:47:58,738 --> 02:48:01,981
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you put the Camel Toe song back in circulation on Orange Lounge Radio?

2120
02:48:02,522 --> 02:48:02,742
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2121
02:48:03,202 --> 02:48:09,007
[SPEAKER_16]: But you might hear it on one of the spinoff shows, Vanilla Sky, Monday nights at 7 o'clock.

2122
02:48:09,288 --> 02:48:12,450
[SPEAKER_16]: Or pump up the volume, Jamie's spinoff show, Tuesday nights at 7.30.

2123
02:48:12,611 --> 02:48:19,076
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you get really lucky and you give him head, you might hear it on Loki's show, Live Wire, coming back in November on Wednesdays.

2124
02:48:20,497 --> 02:48:20,938
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, Loki?

2125
02:48:22,025 --> 02:48:23,025
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a pretty good one.

2126
02:48:23,065 --> 02:48:23,766
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll tell Nelly.

2127
02:48:24,386 --> 02:48:26,647
[SPEAKER_16]: The other question is... Damn you!

2128
02:48:27,147 --> 02:48:30,808
[SPEAKER_16]: You're never here, so... Her friend wants to know, why am I so violent?

2129
02:48:31,629 --> 02:48:32,729
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it's ViolentHyperGirl.

2130
02:48:33,069 --> 02:48:35,190
[SPEAKER_16]: I would say it's all that pent-up sexual energy.

2131
02:48:38,451 --> 02:48:39,732
[SPEAKER_16]: But you know that can be fixed.

2132
02:48:40,312 --> 02:48:44,134
[SPEAKER_16]: Pent-up sexual energy should be unleashed on the masses.

2133
02:48:46,567 --> 02:48:47,548
[SPEAKER_16]: Pip has a question.

2134
02:48:47,608 --> 02:48:49,888
[SPEAKER_16]: Pip would like to know, what homepads do you guys use?

2135
02:48:51,749 --> 02:49:08,313
[SPEAKER_16]: I have an ignition that I kind of got out of a relationship because my ex has been too lazy to pick it up and I guess doesn't really want to talk to me, so I get an ignition pad out of it, I guess, and I got 2DX 3rd and 4th style out of it.

2136
02:49:08,333 --> 02:49:09,094
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not a bad deal.

2137
02:49:11,201 --> 02:49:25,031
[SPEAKER_16]: but the ignition pad's on loan to Jamie right now so what Loki's putting on our webcam right now are the metal pads he just built and those are the new home pads of choice here also, and somebody else asked this question too where is the ferret right now?

2138
02:49:25,191 --> 02:49:32,536
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to see him on the webcam, please um, the ferrets died sorry oh yeah, where are the ferrets?

2139
02:49:32,596 --> 02:49:40,622
[SPEAKER_16]: the ferrets are hiding hey one of those is mine I have custody of one of them they're dead they're all dead

2140
02:49:41,769 --> 02:49:42,850
[SPEAKER_10]: My Tom Cruise impersonation.

2141
02:49:43,671 --> 02:49:44,493
[SPEAKER_16]: Goddamn ferret.

2142
02:49:49,499 --> 02:49:52,082
[SPEAKER_16]: That is all you'll hear on this show because Jamie's not here.

2143
02:49:54,005 --> 02:49:55,186
[SPEAKER_16]: Yo, they wanted to see it on the cam.

2144
02:49:55,206 --> 02:49:55,967
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you put it on the cam?

2145
02:49:57,409 --> 02:49:57,649
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

2146
02:50:00,482 --> 02:50:03,685
[SPEAKER_16]: Kamasaki wants to know, so I've always wanted to ask you guys this.

2147
02:50:04,426 --> 02:50:11,473
[SPEAKER_16]: If you were called Orange Lounge Radio, why don't you just play Orange Lounge Tomosuke songs all day, aside from the fact that they'd repeat after an hour or so?

2148
02:50:12,033 --> 02:50:15,477
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you hit on the first point, it would get pretty old pretty fast.

2149
02:50:15,877 --> 02:50:16,738
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2150
02:50:37,288 --> 02:51:03,926
[SPEAKER_16]: And Wet Pussy Radio was already taken, so We couldn't use that one either Such a bummer And because that's what we picked, so fucking clear your mind I know, I wanted to be Wet Pussy Radio really bad But unfortunately it was taken But for the record, we do play like every single Orange Lounge and Tomosuke song They're all in rotation, because Orange Lounge kicks ass And Tomosuke kicks ass Alright, Tomosuke Tomosuke Wasabi Wasabi

2151
02:51:05,543 --> 02:51:05,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Moving on.

02:51:06,644 --> 02:51:11,327
[SPEAKER_16]: John Fields wants to know, Loki, what's your sim file number at now?

2153
02:51:12,467 --> 02:51:15,749
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know because I actually haven't played Step Mania in like months.

[SPEAKER_16]: So I have tons of them sitting on my hard drive.

[SPEAKER_16]: That game sucks.

2160
02:51:27,117 --> 02:51:30,279
[SPEAKER_16]: It would be better if it was Gal's Panic Radio.

[SPEAKER_16]: When will there be a Loki remix of Mr. Ferret's?

2173
02:52:02,372 --> 02:52:04,793
[SPEAKER_16]: When will there be a Loki remix of Mr. Ferrets?

2174
02:52:07,834 --> 02:52:08,514
[SPEAKER_16]: There's your answer.

[SPEAKER_16]: Zing.

02:52:15,237 --> 02:52:19,658
[SPEAKER_16]: NoStylen also wants to know, How many listeners do you have listening to Orange Lounge Radio right now?

2178
02:52:20,658 --> 02:52:21,159
[SPEAKER_16]: Two and a half.

2179
02:52:22,059 --> 02:52:22,459
[SPEAKER_16]: Two and a half.

2180
02:52:23,099 --> 02:52:23,579
[SPEAKER_16]: You're the half.

2181
02:52:24,260 --> 02:52:26,480
[SPEAKER_16]: How come 23rd Magus has bad jokes?

2182
02:52:27,321 --> 02:52:27,581

[SPEAKER_16]: and WellEducated.

2185
02:52:49,263 --> 02:52:50,924
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura has another question.

2186
02:52:51,544 --> 02:52:55,046
[SPEAKER_16]: Dear Orange Lounge, where the fuck did all two generals go on Ragnarok?

2187
02:52:55,126 --> 02:52:56,667
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to gain another fucking level.

2188
02:52:57,487 --> 02:53:00,809
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd answer that, but I haven't played Ragnarok in about, oh, three months.

2189
02:53:02,730 --> 02:53:04,691
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, does anybody in this room play Ragnarok anymore?

2190
02:53:05,491 --> 02:53:06,272
[SPEAKER_12]: Never have, never will.

2191
02:53:06,292 --> 02:53:06,732
[SPEAKER_16]: Show of hands.

2192
02:53:06,872 --> 02:53:09,813
[SPEAKER_16]: I would be if I had money, but I have no money.

2193
02:53:09,953 --> 02:53:10,714
[SPEAKER_16]: Guess you're fucked.

2194
02:53:10,774 --> 02:53:11,334
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, Jamie.

2195
02:53:11,394 --> 02:53:13,795
[SPEAKER_16]: Not only are you sick, but we can't answer your question.

2196
02:53:13,875 --> 02:53:15,136
[SPEAKER_16]: Boy, are you screwed tonight.

2197
02:53:15,176 --> 02:53:15,516
[SPEAKER_16]: Love ya.

2198
02:53:16,697 --> 02:53:16,857
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

2199
02:53:18,456 --> 02:53:19,736
[SPEAKER_16]: Where are the generals in Ragnarok?

2200
02:53:22,017 --> 02:53:22,397
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

2201
02:53:24,898 --> 02:53:26,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Rob is a fart smeller.

2202
02:53:26,338 --> 02:53:26,839
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm not.

2203
02:53:27,419 --> 02:53:28,479
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't read what chatroom says.

2204
02:53:28,499 --> 02:53:29,339
[SPEAKER_10]: You're one fart smeller.

2205
02:53:29,359 --> 02:53:30,600
[SPEAKER_10]: They spread evil rumors about us.

2206
02:53:31,700 --> 02:53:34,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you guys been to that store, Fart and Smile?

2207
02:53:35,541 --> 02:53:35,681
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2208
02:53:37,202 --> 02:53:41,723
[SPEAKER_16]: Baka wants to know, why is DarkSakura so cool?

2209
02:53:41,763 --> 02:53:43,244
[SPEAKER_16]: We already answered that question.

2210
02:53:43,364 --> 02:53:44,724
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not my fault if you weren't listening.

2211
02:53:44,744 --> 02:53:45,304
[SPEAKER_16]: She's boss.

2212
02:53:45,384 --> 02:53:47,365
[SPEAKER_16]: Because she asked the question herself.

2213
02:53:48,658 --> 02:53:51,259
[SPEAKER_10]: She's far out in a way cool way, man.

2214
02:53:52,060 --> 02:53:53,000
[SPEAKER_10]: She's super rad.

2215
02:53:53,461 --> 02:53:56,022
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the Brady Bunch thing?

2216
02:53:57,283 --> 02:54:00,425
[SPEAKER_10]: You just did like a square thing with your fingers when you said she's totally not square.

2217
02:54:00,465 --> 02:54:01,225
[SPEAKER_10]: That was pretty geeky.

2218
02:54:01,405 --> 02:54:04,247
[SPEAKER_13]: But it was kind of rounded because I didn't make a square right.

2219
02:54:05,007 --> 02:54:07,548
[SPEAKER_16]: It was more of a rectangular rounded shape.

2220
02:54:08,269 --> 02:54:09,610
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe some sort of oval.

2221
02:54:11,391 --> 02:54:14,792
[SPEAKER_16]: She's like She's like Coolsville, daddy-o.

2222
02:54:15,473 --> 02:54:15,853
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

2223
02:54:16,854 --> 02:54:17,374
[SPEAKER_16]: Moving on.

2224
02:54:18,945 --> 02:54:19,965
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm hip to that jive.

2225
02:54:20,005 --> 02:54:23,106
[SPEAKER_16]: Biohazard asked about 20 questions, so I'm saving him for last.

2226
02:54:25,627 --> 02:54:31,888
[SPEAKER_16]: Pixie Dust wants to know, Sky, what would you do if you had a cute gay guy, a popsicle, and a lot of time in a bedroom?

2227
02:54:34,209 --> 02:54:36,370
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd eat the popsicle, then suck his dick, come on!

2228
02:54:39,110 --> 02:54:41,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck him in the ass, then wipe your dick on his curtains.

2229
02:54:47,313 --> 02:54:51,015
[SPEAKER_10]: What possessed you guys to start a radio station in the first place?

2230
02:54:51,035 --> 02:54:53,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Were you high on pot or were you just drunk?

2231
02:54:53,256 --> 02:54:53,776
[SPEAKER_10]: A little bit of both.

2232
02:54:53,796 --> 02:54:57,357
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, I had already been doing radio through my buddy's radio station, Under Sedation Live.

2233
02:55:11,967 --> 02:55:14,768
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd been studying radio in college, so it was nothing new to me.

2234
02:55:16,448 --> 02:55:22,749
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura had been guesting on Understation Live.

2235
02:55:22,769 --> 02:55:25,630
[SPEAKER_16]: She did a good job when she did it, so I said, Hey, Jamie, why don't we do a show?

2236
02:55:25,670 --> 02:55:26,230
[SPEAKER_16]: She said, Sure!

2237
02:55:26,810 --> 02:55:29,571
[SPEAKER_16]: And then Loki just started showing up, but it's worked out nice.

2238
02:55:31,411 --> 02:55:32,031
[SPEAKER_07]: I was there.

2239
02:55:32,231 --> 02:55:35,372
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki just kind of showed up, and it worked.

2240
02:55:38,877 --> 02:55:43,322
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, and Jamie would like to add she was also the most frequent guest on Understation Live, which is true.

2241
02:55:44,884 --> 02:55:45,184
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2242
02:55:46,125 --> 02:55:49,729
[SPEAKER_16]: Biohazard also wants to know, where can I find remixes of Bomani stuff?

2243
02:55:50,710 --> 02:55:51,751
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll let Loki answer that.

2244
02:55:52,191 --> 02:55:53,092
[SPEAKER_16]: The internet.

2245
02:55:54,254 --> 02:55:55,175
[SPEAKER_16]: You want to be more specific?

2246
02:55:57,697 --> 02:55:59,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Check out, well...

2247
02:56:01,075 --> 02:56:04,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Check out Bomani Sims if you want shit.

2248
02:56:05,219 --> 02:56:08,001
[SPEAKER_16]: Go to Diverse Systems' website.

2249
02:56:08,081 --> 02:56:10,903
[SPEAKER_16]: They have a lot of samples you can find.

2250
02:56:11,383 --> 02:56:15,907
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe it's diverse.co.jp, if I remember correctly.

2251
02:56:16,327 --> 02:56:19,369
[SPEAKER_16]: If not, just check the link on Bomani Cell.

2252
02:56:19,389 --> 02:56:23,753
[SPEAKER_15]: There should be a link to their site, because they're the ones that do Bounce Connected CD.

2253
02:56:24,890 --> 02:56:44,479
[SPEAKER_16]: So find their site and look for the artist names on there and then when you see the artist names like Onokin for instance, just search under like Yahoo or something for Onokin then BMS because all the people that do remixes on there, they make BMS files for the Beatmania Sims and they do awesome remixes on there.

2254
02:56:44,499 --> 02:56:52,003
[SPEAKER_16]: That's how I found P8107 without buying the CD is I just ripped the sound from the BMS file, so...

2255
02:56:53,283 --> 02:56:54,223
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a good place to look.

2256
02:56:54,924 --> 02:56:56,904
[SPEAKER_16]: Just search for Bomani remixes.

2257
02:56:56,944 --> 02:57:08,507
[SPEAKER_16]: You'll also find there's a site that does a compendium of every single remix ever made, and they have it organized by song that's remixed from, and you can find links on there too, so just check that out.

2258
02:57:08,807 --> 02:57:10,208
[SPEAKER_10]: You can find them on my hard drive.

2259
02:57:10,248 --> 02:57:14,629
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got about over 100 of them, quite a big collection of official ones, but you're not going to have them.

2260
02:57:14,669 --> 02:57:15,629
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's my clever answer.

2261
02:57:15,729 --> 02:57:17,310
[SPEAKER_16]: Listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because we play them.

2262
02:57:19,639 --> 02:57:23,782
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, Biohazard also wants to know, why do you keep saying you are going to burn the ferrets and you don't?

2263
02:57:23,842 --> 02:57:27,244
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you not able to bring yourself to set aflame the Orange Lounge Radio mascot?

2264
02:57:28,245 --> 02:57:32,388
[SPEAKER_16]: Basically, if I burn the ferrets, Jamie would kick my ass, and I know this.

2265
02:57:32,768 --> 02:57:36,310
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm hoping when she goes away to Alabama, she'll be gone for a good two weeks.

2266
02:57:36,350 --> 02:57:40,833
[SPEAKER_16]: So if I set them on fire just before she leaves, she'll have the whole trip to kind of calm down.

2267
02:57:40,873 --> 02:57:42,654
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm hoping she'll forget by the time she gets back.

2268
02:57:42,735 --> 02:57:44,035
[SPEAKER_16]: So have a nice trip, Jamie.

2269
02:57:44,476 --> 02:57:47,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Also because one of them isn't yours, and so you don't want to burn other people's stuff.

2270
02:57:48,659 --> 02:57:52,262
[SPEAKER_16]: I would just say, you know, I'm sorry, I thought you had fire insurance.

2271
02:57:56,026 --> 02:57:58,548
[SPEAKER_16]: For the good of all radio, I will set it on fire.

2272
02:57:58,849 --> 02:58:01,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Fire, flammable retardant or whatever.

2273
02:58:01,952 --> 02:58:03,053
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm tired.

2274
02:58:03,533 --> 02:58:04,934
[SPEAKER_16]: Next question, Ask Orange Lounge.

2275
02:58:04,954 --> 02:58:06,296
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to finish this up and then end the show.

2276
02:58:06,516 --> 02:58:06,876
[SPEAKER_12]: Please do.

2277
02:58:06,896 --> 02:58:10,420
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got to zip through these because there's only like one minute supposedly left in the show.

2278
02:58:13,216 --> 02:58:19,583
[SPEAKER_16]: Why did the chicken, no wait, where did you get that Mobomoga remix you hear in the Orange Lounge Radio intro?

2279
02:58:19,663 --> 02:58:23,988
[SPEAKER_16]: This is what's interesting about it.

2280
02:58:25,409 --> 02:58:26,651
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't find it anywhere.

2281
02:58:27,598 --> 02:58:30,540
[SPEAKER_16]: This 19 seconds that you're hearing right now is all that exists.

2282
02:58:30,820 --> 02:58:32,741
[SPEAKER_16]: There is no full remix of the song.

2283
02:58:32,781 --> 02:58:33,822
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's the way the story goes.

2284
02:58:34,722 --> 02:58:42,426
[SPEAKER_16]: One of our frequent guests that we've had on the show in the past, Navi, his friend, I can't remember his name that he goes by online.

2285
02:58:42,446 --> 02:58:44,287
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like the Great Hamster or something like that?

2286
02:58:44,828 --> 02:58:48,730
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, his name, but it's the Hamster... Hamster... Hamster Alliance.

2287
02:58:48,890 --> 02:58:50,671
[SPEAKER_16]: Hamster Alliance is what he goes by online.

2288
02:58:51,351 --> 02:58:52,012
[SPEAKER_16]: He just...

2289
02:58:52,831 --> 02:58:57,754
[SPEAKER_16]: Navi was urging him to create a Bomani remix for a Bomani Styles remix contest they had a while back.

2290
02:58:58,214 --> 02:59:01,296
[SPEAKER_16]: And he doesn't really like many Bomani songs, so it was a problem.

2291
02:59:01,316 --> 02:59:03,637
[SPEAKER_16]: Mogamoga is probably his favorite song out of all of them.

2292
02:59:04,318 --> 02:59:07,339
[SPEAKER_16]: And he pretty much remixed those 20 seconds and then said, Ah, fuck it!

2293
02:59:07,640 --> 02:59:11,162
[SPEAKER_16]: Which is too bad, because if he had remixed the whole thing... Best remix I've ever heard.

2294
02:59:11,222 --> 02:59:12,562
[SPEAKER_16]: He probably would have won the whole damn thing.

2295
02:59:12,602 --> 02:59:15,024
[SPEAKER_16]: If he would have remixed more Bomani stuff, he'd have more open mind to it.

2296
02:59:16,085 --> 02:59:17,606
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

2297
02:59:34,249 --> 02:59:45,856
[SPEAKER_16]: But the nice thing is, I asked him when he didn't end up entering it in the contest, but I heard it anyway, I asked him, I'm like, hey, I run a station called Orange Lounge Radio with some friends, you know, maybe we could use that?

2298
02:59:45,916 --> 02:59:46,597
[SPEAKER_16]: He's like, yeah, sure.

2299
02:59:46,997 --> 02:59:47,977
[SPEAKER_16]: So, there you go.

2300
02:59:48,017 --> 02:59:50,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Just that whatever, how many, 15 seconds you brought of it?

2301
02:59:51,380 --> 02:59:54,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, just that 15 seconds is already the best remix I've ever heard.

2302
02:59:54,942 --> 02:59:55,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Ever.

2303
02:59:57,663 --> 02:59:58,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

2304
02:59:58,204 --> 02:59:58,824
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so good.

2305
02:59:58,884 --> 03:00:01,486
[SPEAKER_16]: It sounds like Crystal Method remixed it.

2306
03:00:01,506 --> 03:00:02,947
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why I like it.

2307
03:00:03,027 --> 03:00:03,367
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2308
03:00:04,045 --> 03:00:07,887
[SPEAKER_16]: We're running a little over here, but I want to address the rest of these questions.

2309
03:00:08,027 --> 03:00:13,191
[SPEAKER_16]: Anybody have info on the StepMania SM Max 4 theme that I haven't heard about for a long time?

2310
03:00:13,611 --> 03:00:16,873
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll defer that to Loki, because he's the StepMania expert around here.

2311
03:00:16,893 --> 03:00:18,674
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

2312
03:00:18,694 --> 03:00:19,875
[SPEAKER_16]: I haven't heard anything about it.

2313
03:00:20,335 --> 03:00:20,515
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2314
03:00:21,004 --> 03:00:21,664
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't really care.

2315
03:00:21,724 --> 03:00:24,045
[SPEAKER_16]: They have a good one, though, that supposedly it's pretty good.

2316
03:00:24,225 --> 03:00:25,725
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Transmakina.

2317
03:00:26,605 --> 03:00:29,166
[SPEAKER_16]: That's out right now.

2318
03:00:29,246 --> 03:00:31,887
[SPEAKER_16]: Just look for that on their skinning thread on there.

2319
03:00:32,407 --> 03:00:38,188
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you want information on that, Max, just look at the skinning thread because it would be there if it was anything important.

2320
03:00:42,429 --> 03:00:42,729
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2321
03:00:44,190 --> 03:00:46,570
[SPEAKER_16]: Two more here.

2322
03:00:46,610 --> 03:00:50,011
[SPEAKER_16]: Why does the webcam face a very uninteresting area of your living room?

2323
03:00:50,683 --> 03:00:51,984
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you know what?

2324
03:00:52,244 --> 03:00:53,205
[SPEAKER_16]: There is no interesting area.

2325
03:00:53,225 --> 03:00:54,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Surprise, there is no interesting area.

2326
03:00:54,966 --> 03:00:56,407
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, so what do you expect?

2327
03:00:57,468 --> 03:00:59,709
[SPEAKER_10]: You could open the fridge and get the camera in the fridge.

2328
03:01:00,190 --> 03:01:00,790
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be cool.

2329
03:01:01,130 --> 03:01:01,651
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be cool.

2330
03:01:01,671 --> 03:01:03,352
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be cool.

2331
03:01:07,372 --> 03:01:08,632
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, last question.

2332
03:01:08,712 --> 03:01:12,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry guys that sent their questions in late, but we're running over here.

2333
03:01:12,553 --> 03:01:16,594
[SPEAKER_16]: Biohazard wants to know, why did you pick Live365 to host your station and not some other place?

2334
03:01:17,854 --> 03:01:29,177
[SPEAKER_16]: Basically because Live365 will pay all the licensing for you as well, and although I would be willing to run a shoutcast station, it's just not possible because of our bandwidth.

2335
03:01:29,657 --> 03:01:35,618
[SPEAKER_16]: Believe it or not, we have too many listeners, and we wouldn't be able to maintain the bandwidth for the live show.

2336
03:01:36,318 --> 03:01:37,119
[SPEAKER_16]: We wouldn't be able to do it.

2337
03:01:37,999 --> 03:01:40,881
[SPEAKER_16]: So, sorry, we're kind of stuck with Live365.

2338
03:01:40,921 --> 03:01:56,629
[SPEAKER_16]: Although, honestly, they're not bad, because they, you know, despite you guys get pop-up ads and all that stuff, considering everything you get, which is licensed, paid-for radio, if you want to blame somebody for the fact that Live365 has to have all these pop-ups, blame the RIAA for enacting those licensing laws and all that shit.

2339
03:01:57,089 --> 03:01:59,210
[SPEAKER_16]: That's whose fault it is, not Live365.

2340
03:01:59,230 --> 03:02:01,711
[SPEAKER_16]: They do the best they can, and I've been happy with them thus far.

2341
03:02:01,751 --> 03:02:05,053
[SPEAKER_10]: And another idea, fucking, fucking, go download Mia...

2342
03:02:05,504 --> 03:02:08,706
[SPEAKER_10]: M-E-A-Y-A pop-up ad blocker.

2343
03:02:11,528 --> 03:02:13,549
[SPEAKER_10]: And you won't have any more stupid pop-ups.

2344
03:02:13,569 --> 03:02:14,029
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

2345
03:02:15,070 --> 03:02:18,012
[SPEAKER_10]: And the camera picture makes me look like a torso-less freak.

2346
03:02:18,632 --> 03:02:18,953
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2347
03:02:18,973 --> 03:02:20,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks to all you guys for submitting questions.

2348
03:02:20,614 --> 03:02:21,934
[SPEAKER_16]: God, we had a lot of them tonight.

2349
03:02:22,995 --> 03:02:23,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Jeez Louise.

2350
03:02:23,596 --> 03:02:27,738
[SPEAKER_16]: We should do more questions after the... Well, we'll see.

2351
03:02:31,320 --> 03:02:31,601
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2352
03:02:32,001 --> 03:02:32,581
[SPEAKER_16]: Rebirth.

2353
03:02:33,502 --> 03:02:33,802
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2354
03:02:36,127 --> 03:02:37,627
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it for Ask Orange Lounge.

2355
03:02:43,869 --> 03:02:49,271
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2356
03:02:49,411 --> 03:02:50,991
[SPEAKER_16]: Time's for everybody's final thoughts.

2357
03:02:51,011 --> 03:02:52,612
[SPEAKER_16]: This is time to wrap up the damn show.

2358
03:02:55,152 --> 03:02:56,613
[SPEAKER_16]: Brad, your final thought.

2359
03:02:57,073 --> 03:02:58,453
[SPEAKER_13]: He said pizza looks so good.

2360
03:03:01,114 --> 03:03:02,734
[SPEAKER_10]: That was before my final thought.

2361
03:03:02,774 --> 03:03:04,715
[SPEAKER_10]: My other final thought is you smell like butt.

2362
03:03:08,851 --> 03:03:09,211
[SPEAKER_16]: Bradley.

2363
03:03:11,572 --> 03:03:13,173
[SPEAKER_16]: Gotta get up, gotta get moving.

2364
03:03:15,313 --> 03:03:17,654
[SPEAKER_16]: You sound like an 80s theme song right there, thank you.

2365
03:03:19,315 --> 03:03:19,755
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, Loki.

2366
03:03:22,576 --> 03:03:29,699
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I know I have to drink Theraflute, but, like, lemon tastes like ass, so that sucks.

2367
03:03:30,419 --> 03:03:36,421
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm gonna drink it anyways, because I found out if you drink it with salt, salt is good, and it cuts the sour.

2368
03:03:40,124 --> 03:03:41,645
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie sends along a final thought.

2369
03:03:42,606 --> 03:03:45,128
[SPEAKER_16]: She says, God damn, there went my lung.

2370
03:03:46,088 --> 03:03:47,249
[SPEAKER_16]: And she hacks up the other one.

2371
03:03:47,389 --> 03:03:48,610
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for that lovely imagery.

2372
03:03:50,672 --> 03:03:53,674
[SPEAKER_16]: My final thought is, fuck being sick.

2373
03:03:53,814 --> 03:03:54,795
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate being sick.

2374
03:03:54,935 --> 03:03:57,397
[SPEAKER_16]: You suck, Mother Nature, and bite me.

2375
03:03:58,413 --> 03:03:58,813
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

2376
03:03:59,233 --> 03:04:01,614
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you everybody for listening and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2377
03:04:01,654 --> 03:04:02,535
[SPEAKER_16]: We do appreciate it.

2378
03:04:03,895 --> 03:04:06,257
[SPEAKER_16]: Tune in tomorrow night for Vanilla Sky at 7 o'clock.

2379
03:04:06,397 --> 03:04:07,897
[SPEAKER_16]: Tune in Tuesday night for Pump Up the Volume at 7.30.

2380
03:04:08,638 --> 03:04:12,679
[SPEAKER_16]: Tune in 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for the Bomani Music and More program.

2381
03:04:12,719 --> 03:04:15,761
[SPEAKER_16]: All your favorite DDR, 2DX, and Dance Media favorites.

2382
03:04:16,441 --> 03:04:17,161
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for your support.

2383
03:04:17,562 --> 03:04:18,462
[SPEAKER_16]: We always appreciate it.

2384
03:04:18,602 --> 03:04:19,583
[SPEAKER_16]: Final word of the show.

2385
03:04:20,083 --> 03:04:21,323
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, I don't think you've ever had it.

2386
03:04:21,463 --> 03:04:21,944
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you want?

2387
03:04:22,004 --> 03:04:22,764
[SPEAKER_16]: Final word of the show.

2388
03:04:24,545 --> 03:04:24,945
[SPEAKER_16]: Suck.

2389
03:04:27,521 --> 03:04:29,923
[SPEAKER_14]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2390
03:04:30,363 --> 03:04:34,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

2391
03:04:34,666 --> 03:04:36,527
[SPEAKER_14]: We expect you a nice play again.

2392
03:04:36,987 --> 03:04:39,789
[SPEAKER_14]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2393
03:04:40,310 --> 03:04:50,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as Megatron has, how shall we say, departed, I nominate myself as the new leader.

2394
03:04:50,977 --> 03:04:52,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, the Constructicons formed?

2395
03:04:53,158 --> 03:04:55,120
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.
