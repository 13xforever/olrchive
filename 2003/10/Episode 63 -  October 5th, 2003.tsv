10091	14157	Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
17816	22698	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, where Monty talks and then some.
23379	26080	Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.
26460	30462	Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.
31103	35885	Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.
36485	40187	You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
40507	41988	Yes, I will spank your child.
42388	44109	If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.
46753	48723	Thank you for watching!
49815	50955	Here's to my big opening.
51475	52636	A sphincter says what?
52656	54916	I'm super, thanks for asking.
55276	57857	Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.
57877	59757	What am I doing here?
59937	61498	No.
61738	63138	Dodge this.
63538	65398	This is a tasty burger.
65658	68079	Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.
68319	68979	Yes, I have.
69359	71180	Look, there's a flesh wound.
71420	77781	Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.
78633	79333	Oh yeah?
79554	82895	Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.
83095	84156	DarkSakura.
84356	85256	I've got a sniff.
85517	86057	Skye.
86157	88218	But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.
88618	89118	Loki.
89399	90419	I hate you!
90819	92860	Orange Lounge Radio.
94841	100004	We are live, and this is episode number 63 for October the 5th, 2003.
100424	106928	You're tuned into the Bomani Scene's most sexually educated radio station of all things B-Money.
108783	109704	My name is Rob Roberts.
109744	110885	You might know me as Sky.
112006	114008	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
114048	116691	In this corner, the happiest, most tardy bunny on the farm.
116731	117672	Who's tardy?
117692	119113	You know her better than DarkSakura.
120074	122557	Hi, everybody.
122717	125840	It's Jamie.
125900	126040	Yes.
126080	126921	Yes, Sak.
126961	129264	Jamie's not here right now, so I don't know where she's at.
130501	134765	She's probably stuck in traffic somewhere and we'll be here- FUCKING OLD PEOPLE ON THE WAY OVER!
134785	136646	THE DUMB BITCHES ARE RUNNING!
137007	139429	She parked in my space and I told her to fuck off!
140069	142571	So, I don't know where she is.
142632	143732	She'll be here soon, I'm sure.
143752	148296	Uh, in that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.
149457	150418	I'm a trainer.
153441	153861	Trainable.
153961	154422	Trainable.
154522	155342	I'm a trainable.
156624	157985	That sounds like a lunchable.
158889	163553	And also with us tonight, as well, say hello to our many guests we have in the studio.
163593	167656	We have the one and only Ted Puppy.
168236	168756	How are you?
170218	170958	Tired and pissy.
172099	172539	Alright.
174160	179004	Also with us, say hello to the ever so lovely VHG.
179324	180845	And that stands for many, many things.
181586	182647	Yes, yes it does.
184648	185069	How are you?
185809	186430	I'm good.
186770	186950	Good.
187583	190744	Also with us tonight, say hello to Bradley Arcadian.
191745	192165	Welcome.
193126	193906	You've got mail.
199168	202530	Also with us tonight is Nellie, but she doesn't talk, so we won't bother giving her a mic.
204696	206317	And she'll do sign language into the webcam.
206337	206697	Thank you.
207438	208118	Yeah, I don't get it.
208378	211300	Like, she'll be on the cam, but she won't talk.
211340	213482	Whereas Jamie will talk, but not be on the cam.
213562	216724	So, like, why don't you just pretend that Nelly is Jamie?
217044	219586	And then, like, you know... Nah, it don't work.
219866	220126	Anyway.
225129	226871	Uh, plenty of things to talk about.
227071	228091	Oh, there she is!
228211	228792	Hello!
231554	231874	Okay.
231894	231934	Um...
235307	239894	We will... Jamie already says I hate people.
239914	241817	You want to say something before break or you want to wait until after?
242058	243620	Alright, she'll wait until after.
244041	247446	We'll take a quick break, we'll be back and yeah, talk about stuff.
442244	442782	Thanks for watching!
481286	482211	Thank you for watching!
525086	526327	Orange Lounge Radio.
526648	528810	We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.
536357	538719	Howdy everybody, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
538759	541102	Here we are at the start of episode number 63.
543004	543965	Whoop-dee-doo.
544365	545525	What an exciting week.
545846	551949	Not quite as exciting of a week as last week when we had Max 2 was out and new and all that other fun stuff.
552269	559873	Although, Jamie's here and she brought with her, she brought the US versions of VRare 1 and VRare 2.
560373	562535	I bet you have to get it at Fry's, correct?
562695	570001	V-Rare 1 you got at Toys R Us, actually, with DDR Max, and V-Rare 2 you have to get at Fry's, which is pissing a lot of East Coast people off.
570161	570962	Because there's no Fry's out there.
570982	572043	Because there's no Fry's out there.
572103	572584	Sucks for them.
572964	577448	Well, I know Fry's runs a website at Outpost.com, right?
579120	580360	That was the only place you were able to get.
580601	585764	You remember when Dance Dance Revolution for the PC came out, you could only get it at Fry's, it was a Fry's exclusive.
586065	588206	We were supposed to care about DDRPC?
588767	590388	I know, but humor me for a second here.
591349	594591	So theoretically, shouldn't you be able to get those samplers at Outpost.com?
595252	601296	I don't know, and I really don't care because I already have that too, and I could just get the VR online somewhere.
601436	602437	I would think so, but...
603459	605060	And I am not a collector, sir.
605080	605900	Hello, Jamie.
605920	605960	Yo.
628968	629408	So what's up?
629948	630589	I'm fucking tired.
631289	631809	Oh, I'm sorry, yeah?
631829	632269	I hate people.
632990	633530	You hate people?
633590	634830	I hate people who tailgate me.
635570	638111	I hate people who go too slow in front of me while people are tailgating me.
639812	642433	And I hate the stinky old man at my apartment complex.
644014	648155	Well, I think now might be a good time to get into our favorite game we like to play here at Orange Lounge Radio.
648555	650536	How was your day and how was your week?
651536	654577	So, I think, Jamie, it would be most appropriate if you would start us off tonight.
655018	655798	Um, well...
657162	658823	Starting with the week, the week was pretty good.
660283	662744	You know, nothing really horrible happened.
663685	668346	Got to have somewhat of a date with Stan, which we hardly ever get to spend time together.
669587	670187	It was pretty good.
671828	672588	Last night was great.
674329	676670	I drank how much last night?
677070	677370	A lot.
678166	687333	Not as much as I usually do when I go drinking, but it was pretty good and I was very happy and spent most of the evening with a pleasant buzz.
692156	692657	What did we do?
692717	694218	Oh yeah, it was Chubb's birthday.
694939	696280	Yes, Chubb's birthday party was his day.
696660	700243	And that was really lots of fun and happy birthday to Chubb's being 21 now.
700263	700383	Yeah.
704460	706901	Played some Pump It Up while someone intoxicated.
707442	709823	Played lots of that crappy Wanda Bee Pachinko machine.
710563	712384	And I have, like, this blue-spotted dog.
713945	716707	And a cup that says Dave and Buster's on it.
718008	718248	Ooh.
720509	727773	Um, today, though, I'm, you know, in bed, sleeping, because I was up until 5.30 in the morning.
729354	732956	And I hear, If you don't get up and help me clean this house...
733726	735047	You're not going to go to your show!
736428	738769	So I get up and go, excuse me!
740030	740930	And then clean the house.
742931	746693	So I spent practically all of my day cleaning the house.
748194	750595	Then had a nice shower, got ready.
752096	754177	I stayed at home long enough to turn on the show.
755878	758400	And went to the grocery store.
761335	767496	And then I was in every bit of bad traffic I could possibly imagine, short of there being a wreck.
768236	774137	Because, you know, I wouldn't be here right now had there been a wreck, because I would still be behind all these people, stopping and staring at the wreck.
775338	775678	Wow.
777418	779458	Oh my god, I see a bloody stump!
780618	782179	That's an arm.
783379	784379	Ooh, yay.
784399	789020	You know, if you want to see bloody stumps, just go, like, rent a horror movie or something.
793783	798624	I was talking about if there had been an accident, people would be stopping and going, oh, can I see a bloody stump?
800684	805285	So, at any rate, that's why I was late.
806146	807286	You know, stupid people.
808626	810367	And now I'm doing laundry.
810987	815028	Oh yeah, I had another thing happen during the week, but it's really retarded.
816568	816648	Um...
818624	820565	I never mind, I'm not going to talk about that because it sucks.
820605	821285	I figured as much.
825547	826807	I played some PSO.
827668	831069	My game froze in the middle of playing PSO, so I lost the two levels I gained.
831769	835731	And all of my items that weren't equipped, including my meteor cudgel, which pissed me off.
836891	838232	But I'm getting them all back.
838972	840072	And that's really about it.
841213	843233	Buy stuff from my vendor in Ragnarok, thank you.
844834	846255	Alright, let's move on.
846615	846955	Puppy!
848223	849724	How was your day and how was your week?
850904	859828	Let's see, today I'm kind of pissy because I've had too much chemistry work to do.
859928	866350	I've spent all day writing up lab reports and writing up freaking chemistry things.
867030	870832	I had to bring my chemistry book with me so I could work on it before the show started.
871804	893218	And then I had a little adventure at lunch I wanted to go get food before leaving to come to the show So I go down the street to Carl's Jr's I look inside There's like 15 people in line to order And like one person working behind the counter So I'm like, screw this I go over to the subway nearby
894096	895397	They don't take ATM cards.
895778	899761	I go down to the two grocery stores in the same plaza and neither of them have working ATMs.
900181	903384	I drive halfway across town to go to a liquor store that has an ATM.
903644	904305	It's not working.
904625	907328	I drive back downtown to go get food.
907748	911772	And then when I finally get back with it, it's, like, not the right thing.
912112	916716	And I ate it anyways because I was hungry and had meaty thing in almost 24 hours.
918097	919999	So yeah, that made me kind of pissy.
921658	950728	and then the whole stupid driver thing that's like for everybody that drives except for the stupid drivers themselves and then um yeah this week I just did school stuff and then played lots of Initial D because it's like sucking me in oh yes Disgaea too because that's just too cool oh excuse me and I'm done
953032	955093	Bradley, how was your day and how was your week?
955973	961794	Alright, beginning this week I went to a temp agency and then they sent me to an interview for data entry position the next day.
962975	971397	I did okay on that, but of course as I go on I think of many different ways that I screwed it up.
971797	977239	But it was like my first real job interview talking to an actual person in front of them.
977259	981740	It was like the only other job interview I've ever done was over the phone for an intern thing like
982424	992729	I was supposed to find out at the end of Tuesday if he had decided yes or no.
994230	999192	The person in the agency is supposed to call me back, but she never does.
1000333	1004715	I was waiting until the next morning, and I called him and said, what did he decide?
1005215	1011018	He's looking at the resumes and everything, so we have to wait a bit longer.
1011667	1018219	and so we'll wait until Thursday, Friday and he hasn't decided by Friday yet so I guess we'll find out next week sometime
1018973	1021815	So, I doubt I'll get it, because I didn't do all that great.
1022076	1022576	You know what, though?
1023196	1033064	I've been in a very similar position in job hunting, where you're going to, like, 10 pages to 10 pages of your staffing agency, whatever it is, and I swear to God, those people are never really with it.
1033184	1035846	Like, they never are able to meet their deadlines or whatever.
1035887	1040410	You're just strung along like a stupid puppet, and then finally, just out of the blue, one day it'll hit.
1040530	1042632	So, we'll all cross our fingers for you.
1042832	1043092	Yeah.
1043973	1047136	So, well, I'll have to go look at stuff next week.
1047476	1047596	Yep.
1048479	1049019	That's the future.
1049580	1058287	Maybe try to fake my way to knowing medical terminology, but since I know a little bit, I may be able to fake that somewhere.
1059288	1064332	But, uh, let's see, yesterday didn't do too much, I don't think.
1064412	1069776	And then today, watched some TV, and came over here.
1069796	1072778	I think that's basically it for my week.
1076241	1076521	Alright.
1077222	1077482	Okay.
1079386	1082927	Alright then, let's see, who else wants to talk about their weekend of day?
1083187	1083967	How about VHD?
1083987	1090428	You got a minute away from the kitchen that you can... Well, I know we got Loki, but Loki's doing some stuff there.
1090808	1093428	Okay, then, oh, here comes VHD.
1094929	1095729	So, what do you want to know?
1096129	1097869	I want to know, how was your day and how was your week?
1098669	1108411	Hmm, my week's actually been kind of okay, other than the fact that I had to switch to an 8am class, and I'm still waitlisted for math, I guess I'm cool.
1109221	1112002	Which, by the way, I hate WLD 57 with a passion.
1112882	1113683	What the hell is that?
1114243	1115123	Workload English.
1115383	1115503	Oh.
1118344	1119284	Shut the hell up, puppy!
1119965	1120285	Shut up!
1121845	1123486	But yeah, I hate it with a passion.
1124466	1126347	We actually have this journal entry we're supposed to write.
1126707	1129248	The beginnings and endings, just anything about it.
1129768	1134289	So my topic now is the beginning of Workload 57 and the end of my life.
1136870	1137891	Which is how bad it is.
1138031	1138711	Interesting.
1139409	1145831	I've written on my friend's legal pad, kill me now, please, just kill me now, during English class.
1147491	1147891	So, yeah.
1148751	1152932	And other than that, been cutting back on initial D, slowly.
1153932	1154653	Good for you!
1157493	1159374	I'm just messing with you.
1159414	1166956	Let's see, been kind of studying, extra emphasis on kind of, going out, meeting lots of people.
1166976	1168816	Other than that, it's been a pretty okay week.
1169682	1172584	Oh, except my mom's always over-emotional every time she comes here.
1173025	1174006	It's getting kind of irritating.
1174066	1178229	It's like, gee, mom, I'm not going to die while I'm in Davis, okay?
1178489	1179870	But I'll miss my baby!
1180651	1181632	You know, it's kind of funny.
1181652	1184174	I actually thought she didn't like having me around the house.
1184834	1188077	And then, like, all of a sudden they move away and now she's like, oh my god.
1188277	1191600	They can't wait to get rid of you until they do and then they miss you like hell.
1191960	1192180	Yep.
1192841	1193281	So, yeah.
1193461	1194222	It's been a pretty good week.
1198906	1199026	Um...
1200859	1204947	I'm eating these blue chips so I'm having a hard time talking right now.
1205708	1208974	Next we'll go to Loki and see how his day and his week was.
1209014	1213543	But first I want to say hello to some new chatters we have in our chat room tonight because we have a lot of new people in the chat room tonight.
1214958	1215759	Are they listening?
1216019	1216980	Are they listening?
1217000	1217240	I hope so.
1217260	1219001	They better be listening because we know.
1219361	1222884	We know and we will find out and you will pay if you're not.

1250565	1251285	Hello to everybody.
1252986	1254626	Okay, Loki, how was your day?
1254647	1255107	How was your week?
1255807	1257027	I didn't do anything today.
1257688	1261189	Except I started wiring my second pads.
1261609	1262490	And those are almost done.
1262670	1263550	Probably be done this week.
1265351	1267772	And I was playing on the one that is done.
1269012	1271513	And it was pretty cool until the ground wire fell off.
1272529	1301859	and that didn't work too well so I had to re-solder that and I didn't do that much I worked a little bit last night up until about 5 in the morning and did some stuff because I rebooted my computer you dumbass and it automatically kicks on right away anyways and then um I don't know that's about it people were gone from my work so I had it pretty easy the last two days just ate sandwiches and um
1302916	1303636	Red the Internet.
1305997	1306357	Cool deal.
1307397	1308297	Yeah.
1308777	1310438	Oh, and downloaded more Zim.
1311518	1311958	New Zim.
1312678	1314279	Because you're the biggest pirate ever.
1314459	1314659	Arr.
1315239	1315399	Arr.
1315779	1318400	We watched a cool video today that I got off the Internet.
1321161	1323121	It's about teaching sex.
1323481	1324641	We'll get into it in the afterbirth.
1325222	1325402	Okay.
1325422	1327062	We're going to make Jamie watch it during the afterbirth.
1327202	1327802	Okay.
1329603	1330823	You have to go home right after the show?
1332950	1333930	Can't stay for a little bit?
1335311	1335551	Okay.
1336291	1337472	But I want to tell!
1337832	1338512	Fine, tell.
1338692	1340913	It's about teaching sex ed to retards.
1341974	1343234	It's an instructional video.
1347476	1348276	They were called trainers.
1348356	1349016	Trainables.
1350037	1351037	Trainables, whatever.
1351617	1352578	I should think.
1352638	1353138	Diapers.
1353378	1353898	Trainables.
1354058	1354338	Okay.
1356259	1360481	Anyway, we'll get into that in the afterbirth, which is after the credits of the program.
1361550	1364552	God, our chat room is such a bunch of moody bitches, I swear.
1364632	1370617	All the people I didn't say hi to, like all of our regulars who've been here weeks and weeks before, they get their FUs read every week and everything.
1370977	1372879	Now they're all, why didn't you say hi to me?
1373099	1374400	Why didn't you say hi to me, crybaby?
1374420	1375581	Because you don't matter.
1377943	1380365	I'm trying to extend a warm welcome to the new people.
1380405	1382967	The old people should already feel appreciated.
1384248	1384828	We love Orange.
1384908	1389512	I give a general shout out hello to the Orange Lounge chat in general.
1391269	1393070	and I gave Jamie a dollar yesterday.
1395532	1396553	And he got to spend a liquor.
1398414	1399635	Bitch, I bought you a drink.
1401576	1402357	You drink half of it.
1404318	1405098	That's neither here nor there.
1405339	1410262	So then without further ado, I'll talk about my week and my day because I actually have video game stories to talk about.
1410282	1410902	Shock of shocks.
1413925	1422767	Let's see, this week I actually went out and played DDR not once, not twice, but three times.
1423067	1424008	And Rob can count.
1424808	1425668	Scary, isn't it?
1425728	1426588	And you know what's weird?
1427028	1430569	I think this is actually working because my pants are like about ready to fall off.
1430769	1431910	It's like they're down to here.
1433250	1434010	I'm losing weight.
1434030	1434891	This is so exciting.
1435131	1437951	My ass is getting smaller with all this DDR I've been playing.
1437991	1438812	I'm so happy.
1439752	1440192	But anyway...
1442253	1452317	Well, I know, but it's not just that, but it's that I've been playing it more in the past month, and I've been, you know, eating less crap.
1452537	1454258	I still eat crap, but I'm eating less crap.
1455598	1456199	And all that stuff.
1459720	1461621	And now Iron Chef VHG is cooking me dinner.
1463081	1465102	I wonder what I need to bring in next week, then.
1466623	1467283	This is great.
1468433	1479527	The women bring food every week and cook for us here on Orange Lounge Radio I got told not to push my luck That's just because I can't cook I will cook one week
1481494	1482375	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1500487	1508189	It's kind of stupid because it's really hard to keep a perspective on where you're at if you're trying to move as well.
1508229	1514950	So most people, the serious players of Playoff Zero at Golf Land, they don't put on the seatbelt so the thing won't rock.
1515650	1517491	Because if you're not wearing your seatbelt, you won't rock.
1518751	1522131	Thursday I went and did the same thing and I got another AAA.
1522191	1523872	I'm trying to AAA heavy songs now.
1524632	1525872	I AAA'd Kind Lady.
1526972	1529333	Yeah, you were there.
1531167	1531747	AAA Air?
1532348	1532868	I'll work on it.
1533788	1534089	Is it?
1534549	1535529	I'm very close.
1535770	1536470	What was I really close?
1536710	1539492	I'm really close on, like, Butterfly and Let's Get Down, the easy ones.
1539512	1540392	I can get, like, one great.
1540712	1543794	I just haven't yet to... I've yet to get zero greats.
1545275	1546976	What else have I gotten really close on?
1546996	1549037	There was another one I got really, really close on the other day.
1551178	1553179	Oh, yeah, I'm really close on Let's Groove as well.
1553739	1554580	But there's something else.
1554620	1558202	I think Do It Right, the purple one, with the purple...
1559014	1561156	Harmonize Two-Step, thank you, I'm really close on that one too.
1562518	1562718	So.
1564280	1565000	Uh, oh, and 1998.
1565681	1570266	Anyway, so there's like a lot of these sevens I'm really close on, but I haven't done it yet.
1571255	1572035	I'm so close!
1572495	1573916	Anyway.
1574756	1582059	So there's been that, and Friday I went out there too, but I just played a couple games because I was going to meet somebody more than anything on Friday.
1582739	1591462	And then yesterday was Chubb's birthday party, and I went with DarkSakura to San Jose, and we went to Milpitas Golf Land.
1591482	1596904	I got to play some Horsey Crack, because I haven't played in about three months, so I started a new horse, and her name is Sana.
1597544	1598624	Oh, I retired Happy Bunny.
1599025	1600025	Yes, you retired Happy Bunny.
1600737	1601898	and Bride of Kiriyamaoka.
1602999	1606201	Wow, you made a Kiriyamaoka breed, huh?
1607042	1610905	No, my horse and who was the mommy horse?
1611185	1611966	One of Mel's horses.
1613047	1614808	And they birthed a Kiriyamaoka.
1614828	1616029	Did you get any other rare horses?
1616770	1617650	I just have my three.
1618031	1624836	I saw a horsey on the top list, like the number one horse on the list was like a panda, but it was brown.
1624856	1625977	Yeah, it was a chocolate panda.
1626898	1627378	That was neat.
1627478	1628119	How exciting.
1630461	1631602	Yes, to go with the chocolate martinis.
1633483	1635044	Then, what else was I thinking?
1635124	1641948	Oh, also, the other cool thing about Derby Owners Club, I've never seen, for some reason, whenever I've been to play, I always get, like, the outdoorsy tracks.
1641988	1646951	I've never seen that track that's Sega, and it's, like, nighttime, and it has Sonic the Hedgehog on it and stuff.
1647231	1648032	That's a good track.
1648372	1648852	It's cute.
1649232	1649613	I like it.
1651294	1652995	I saw the coolest thing, though, on Horsey Crack.
1653315	1653475	What?
1653495	1653575	What?
1654375	1656596	A five horse photo finish.
1656857	1658398	Oh yeah, I remember seeing that.
1658638	1659899	The five horse photo finish.
1660339	1661019	It's crazy.
1661420	1665442	Five horses all finished with the same seconds and like what, thousandth second?
1665462	1666763	They all finished five of them.
1666803	1667343	It was crazy.
1668884	1671046	And three of them were nose and two of them were neck.
1672327	1674648	And if you've never played Horsey Crack before, it's lots of fun.
1674688	1677250	And if you live in SoCal, I hear they're all over SoCal now.
1677330	1678511	And there's a couple in NorCal too.
1680472	1681813	Yes, VHG, Horsey Crack.
1684843	1703077	and then after Milpitas Golf Land we went over to Dave and Buster's and oh my god oh my god I love Dave and Buster's like I've never had as much fun as I did yesterday because we drank yesterday and this is what I learned about Dave and Buster's I never knew this before call me stupid or whatever but I never knew this before there's little lights above all the machines and if you're sitting in a machine and you're playing and it can be anything
1703357	1703958	Thanks for watching!
1719122	1720223	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1744594	1745355	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1774914	1779955	They had that one, and it's also in the same family of Namco games as Prop Cycle.
1779995	1780616	The Prop Cycle.
1780636	1781316	What is it?
1781376	1781836	Kayaking.
1781936	1782756	It was a kayaking game.
1782776	1783516	Is that what you call it?
1783696	1785377	Well, more like Inflatable Raft.
1785397	1786517	Inflatable Raft.
1786877	1787477	River Rafting.
1787738	1788358	Okay, we'll call it River.
1788378	1789078	It's a River Rafting game.
1789118	1790458	It is so much fun.
1790518	1792559	And Jamie and I kicked ass at it our first time.
1792599	1794059	We were on the high score list our first game.
1794299	1795240	Yeah, number one.
1796320	1796720	Shut up, Loki.
1798206	1801209	We ran the whirlpool and everything, and the penguins.
1802049	1804992	So DarkSakura and I did a little, yes, there were penguins at the end of the glacial level, so cute.
1805112	1810377	Anyway, DarkSakura and I, we played this game and we drank a lot.
1810437	1814220	Like, I didn't really get to drink a lot, though, because I was driving, so I had to be responsible.
1814240	1815642	I was still under my usual.
1815922	1817063	And I had my one martini.
1817844	1822668	And then we played Pump It Up Premiere 3, which I'd never seen before, but they had Premiere 3 of Pump It Up there.
1822688	1823589	I played all the old crap.
1824927	1829052	There's only one licensed recognizable song in the whole game.
1829924	1830544	and it's pink.
1830705	1831565	Get the party started.
1834387	1839710	But it's really crazy because there's parts... If you play it on crazy mode, like, they ain't fucking with you.
1839750	1840570	It really is crazy.
1840610	1846634	You'll be jumping around and, like, you'll have this freeze that are the top two arrows because, you know, Pump It Up is five.
1846714	1847955	It's four corners in the center.
1848235	1853498	So it's like the top two arrows and then you have to hit the middle one with your hand and then the back two with your hand as well.
1853858	1855939	And this is all in the span of about, like, one second.
1856020	1856540	It's crazy.
1857722	1859543	It's like a 12-footer.
1859763	1860284	It's sick.
1860964	1869829	So we were watching Chubbs, and people tried to do that, and it was really funny, because Chubbs was really drunk, and he was doing it on the ground and stuff.
1870170	1872871	She was hand-slamming and stuff, and he was like, ow, my hand hurts.
1873151	1874012	It was so funny.
1874512	1875173	It was so funny.
1875493	1877374	Johnny and I were all playing all the Wimpy Easy stuff.
1877890	1878370	Oh, that was cool.
1878390	1879972	I played Conga on hard.
1880372	1880772	It was fun.
1881073	1883675	Yeah, and then Chubbs is all, hey, can I take your game?
1883695	1884395	Can I do a song?
1884435	1885596	I'm like, okay, just don't fail.
1885956	1888298	He failed B in five seconds.
1889980	1890540	I was so mad.
1890580	1892021	That was like two dollars I was out.
1892281	1893843	Because Dave and Buster's is expensive.
1894803	1895844	But, good times.
1895944	1897826	Otherwise... There was the humongous food court.
1899548	1903049	Oh my god, at the Great Mall, they had the biggest food court I've ever seen in my life.
1903149	1903649	Oh my god.
1904070	1909492	They had, like, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, McDonald's, steak.
1910332	1911952	Yeah, it was a rip-off, but it was huge.
1914553	1915374	It's so big.
1919075	1927618	So, uh, yeah, we did all that, and then we got home last night at about 2am, and then Loki and I were watching music videos until, uh, late.
1928857	1929777	Which one might I talk about later?
1929817	1930117	I don't know.
1932098	1936039	So, I guess we'll take a break.
1937819	1939200	Unless anybody else has something they want to say?
1939280	1941360	Let's play some of that VRare 2 stuff tonight.
1941420	1942361	Okay, let's do that.
1942481	1944941	Let's play something on VRare 2.
1945282	1954924	There's nothing... There's nothing new that hasn't been in Japan already, but it's new to the U.S.
1955184	1957485	And there's just some interesting things on it, so why not?
1958154	1958914	We'll give it a spin.
1959215	1959975	Let's see.
1959995	1964297	We'll play... I don't play anything that's super long, so... I think that we should go with...
1992372	1995934	You know what, looking at this, I'm really not sure what to, because some of these are really long.
1996915	1998236	Yeah, so I'll just play some of the game edits.
1998256	2001417	Here's the funk disco extended mix of High Lady.
2002458	2002738	Okay.
2004479	2004880	What is that?
2004920	2005700	It's kind of a long one.
2006060	2008302	It's kind of long, so this will be the only song we play this break.
2008342	2012424	When we come back, we will talk about other stuff.
2012444	2014085	We'll talk about some Imani news going on.
2014485	2015606	Loki will give us a sim update.
2015706	2017007	And later tonight, by the way...
2019105	2021147	I don't want to ruin it if it's your cage match pick.
2021207	2023609	Oh no, you're picking, you told me you're doing the paranoia thing, right?
2024290	2024610	Tonight?
2026452	2028854	So we have a new Loki remix to debut tonight, yes?
2029514	2032377	Yes, so we have a new Loki remix to debut a little later on in the program.
2033538	2037321	So, enjoy this from the DDR Max 2 VRare.
2037341	2040224	This is Kind Lady, the funky disco extended mix, and we'll be back.
2087360	2088123	and many more.
2131946	2144476	I'll give the love you need till you hover in obscurity I'm like a restaurant, I'm a great lady You can hurt me, but I am the cure And when you wake up late thinking it's a dream Just touch me, boy, you know you can count on me Believe me!

2509619	2509919	DJ Ranma S
2532694	2539358	DDR Max, it says, Dance Dance Revolution game features over 70 songs and 100 plus minutes of authentic dance music.
2539738	2549803	And then DDR Max 2 says, the DDR Max 2 Dance Dance Revolution game features over 65 songs and 100 minutes, exactly, of authentic dance music.
2550664	2550724	Eww.
2550744	2552605	Well, it's not cooked yet.
2552625	2554045	I need to marinate it, though.
2554345	2554646	Alright.
2555186	2556927	Eww, you ungrateful veggie cookie.
2556947	2558868	You've been here and you're going, eww.
2559368	2560729	Because it looks ewwy.
2562758	2564660	There's conversations going on here without a microphone.
2565981	2566501	You know what?
2568463	2570964	There's a big rule that I try to remember.
2570984	2572245	It's called never think while you eat.
2574967	2577649	We'll just take a picture of it and put it in front of you while you're eating dinner.
2577950	2578310	Fun.
2578410	2579891	Then we'll remind you of your ew.
2582473	2583494	It'll look better when it's cooked.
2583534	2583894	I know it will.
2585835	2589118	Then when you look on the side, it says in really, really tiny print,

2599971	2601832	And in the Max 2, it says V-Rare Soundtrack 2.
2602232	2607496	So, it's kind of like, it's in really, really tiny print, but it's kind of a nod to the Japanese V-Rare ones.
2608336	2608677	Very.
2609397	2609897	V, very rare.
2609917	2610558	Very rare.
2610998	2612059	It's very rare.
2612819	2614581	If it were meat, it would still be mooing.
2616642	2618923	Actually, for the record, Max 2 has 69 songs in it.
2620538	2621338	What a nice number.
2621998	2623299	Not quite 70, but 69.
2623779	2625059	And I think Max1 had like 71.
2625119	2631060	So... So yay.
2635361	2636721	What else can I tell you about what's going on?
2636741	2638782	What's going on in Bomani News this week?
2638942	2640542	Anybody hear any interesting things?
2641062	2641742	Yes, Loki.
2643223	2645263	I know some things, and if you don't mention them, I will.
2647506	2648067	Yes, Loki.
2648667	2651429	Okay, a bunch of shit's gone down this week.
2652050	2656674	Um, starting with, um, first off, more details about DDR Extreme.
2657575	2660277	Um, it being that it's very similar to Max 2.
2660397	2661618	Ooh, surprise.
2662199	2662839	Surprise?
2666983	2669665	Okay, anyways, um, let's see.
2670286	2671787	There's gonna be dancing characters.
2671887	2672828	Ooh, surprise.
2673288	2674369	I know everyone's surprised.
2674749	2674870	Um...
2675916	2678897	I think we announced last week's A Stupid Barber was going to be in there.
2679838	2680038	Yes.
2680058	2680538	That type of shit.
2680758	2684339	And I'm trying to think, what else?
2687020	2692182	Nothing really else as far as, you know... Did we announce the other songs that were going to be in it?
2692242	2693203	Yeah, we probably did, didn't we?
2693983	2694583	Probably.
2695243	2696824	That's no big deal, though.
2697684	2699325	So yeah, not too much going on with DDR Extreme.
2699345	2703927	They're not going to release too much more information because obviously it's coming out in a couple weeks, so, you know...
2704867	2709048	I don't honestly think there's going to be too much more unlocked in that game than what they have.
2709068	2710388	It'll probably be A Stupid Barber.
2710448	2711048	And guess what?
2711908	2716769	I found out today that Forever Sunshine is going to be Forever Ours in the U.S.
2717309	2724290	Yes, that piece of shit, Forever Sunshine, is going to be pretty much replacing Let Them Move in the U.S.
2725030	2727891	as the piece of shit track that they get to put on every single release.
2728111	2728811	Now, wait a minute.
2728891	2733952	Last week we did have that vote, and Let Them Move is still considered the worst of the two songs.
2735003	2742789	Yeah, okay, so basically what you're saying is instead of, like, Carrot Top, I have, um, I don't know, um... Charro.
2743489	2745251	Yeah, I have that.
2745971	2753297	I mean, they're both bad, but, you know, it'll still wear on you, but anyways...
2754073	2755954	Enough with DDR Extreme, nothing going on there.
2756254	2760516	The big news was in Dance Dance Revolution Party Collection, which they announced the new tracks.
2760596	2765279	And this is what's coming out after Extreme, and there's more news coming out on this mix than there is on the other one.
2765899	2768080	First off, let's start with the new exclusive songs.
2768320	2770501	Well, some of them exclusive, but anyways.
2770541	2774123	We have Freedom, the new B4U track, which no one gets to rat's ass about.
2774704	2777545	Wannabe by the Spice Girls, which is also going to be in Dancing Stage.
2777565	2778926	I have a rant about that when you're done.
2780267	2788532	Try to Love You, which was also in Max 2 USA, Stars, which was in Poppin' Music, Stars in Second Naoki Style, whatever that means.
2789092	2790153	We might have that somewhere.
2790453	2791753	I'm going to look for that, see if we have it.
2792594	2804221	I need you, the Inside Out Door Mix, which is a remix of I Need You from Max 2 USA, and then a new Paranoia remix called Paranoia Respect by 0.3K.
2804561	2806262	Just What the World Needs, another Paranoia mix.
2806282	2808544	Which is probably going to be a 300 BPM Paranoia.
2809484	2814146	and they announced a few more licensed tracks in here.
2814186	2818828	Unfortunately, I didn't know which ones were new than what we had last time.
2818988	2823150	One of the ones I remember is Music, which is from 4th Mix.
2824270	2825131	Oh, I love that song!
2826213	2831154	Um, Ecstasy from 5th Mix, of course, um, Overblast was another one.
2831894	2835175	It looks like it's a pretty decent collection of, like, songs in there.
2835775	2838916	Um, Moonlight Shadow, you know, Missing Heart, um, is pretty good.
2839276	2843977	Plus, this game has selectable characters, and you earn the characters as you go along in it.
2844097	2850479	And that's another thing about DDR Extreme, is you earn the characters as you go along, not all at one time unlocked, like in Max 2 USA.
2852235	2854837	The selection screen for the characters is actually pretty cool.
2854857	2859640	They had a video that was on IGN that people grabbed shots from that are pretty cool.
2859660	2862081	You know what it reminded me of, that character selection screen?
2862101	2864763	Have you guys ever played one of those bootleg Nintendo carts?
2864823	2870986	It's like Mortal Kombat with 64 characters, and they have all these little tiny pictures just all lined up in a big table.
2871287	2876930	That's what it reminded me of, the character selection screen, because there's so many characters in this party collection.
2880955	2881739	anyways uh...
2883157	2885098	So that's pretty much all that's going on there.
2885358	2888339	Obviously, it's going to be a reskinned Extreme engine.
2890000	2891421	Can I bitch for a minute about something?
2891661	2891841	Yeah.
2892041	2897163	I want to know why in the hell we're only getting one new Dance Mania license on this whole thing.
2897503	2899444	That license being Wannabe by the Spice Girls.
2899544	2903646	Without the obvious that it was on the Euromix, so we're getting it too.
2903966	2909449	I mean, because, you know, there's a hundred songs I could bring over from one of the USAs or Euromixes just because we got it.
2909909	2911930	Wannabe by the Spice Girls was on...
2912490	2913952	I believe it was Zipmania Best.
2913972	2918237	It was on one of the Dance Mania albums.
2918317	2919178	Dance Mania Diamond.
2919238	2920279	Easy.
2920479	2923363	Why waste any more effort on a compilation?
2924246	2925787	But why just one?
2925867	2928249	Because you'll buy it just the same.
2928309	2929990	No, I won't.
2930050	2931131	Not because of that song.
2931671	2933833	I mean, the Spice Girls are so five years ago.
2933853	2936114	If this was five years ago, fuck yeah, I would have eaten that shit up.
2936414	2938836	But this is five years later and everybody knows the Spice Girls are lame.
2938856	2941818	But Japan isn't exactly on top of modern culture in the US.
2941898	2942719	I understand that.
2942739	2945801	For them, the Spice Girls are like, whoa, that's so cutting edge.
2949008	2951429	I understand that, but why just one?
2951549	2953189	I would rather they do none.
2953269	2958210	If you looked at DDR best hits, there was nothing new about it.
2958790	2961651	It was just clear-cut best tracks.
2962491	2965432	Why give us these new tracks when they fucking suck?
2965452	2966652	I don't know.
2967112	2968672	Well, I don't know about these Konami originals.
2968692	2969232	They may be good.
2969452	2977354	When I talk about Dance Mania licenses, either you're going to take the effort to give us a lot of new Dance Mania stuff, which would be nice and very well appreciated, trust me, and prove that DDR is not dead yet.
2978457	2980882	or you can give us crap.
2981904	2983187	And that's what we're getting, is crap.
2984318	2988561	Now, aside from home versions, there was a little bit of arcade news this week.
2989121	2991183	First being DDR Extreme.
2992924	2996446	Everyone remembers back to when they were first releasing DDR Extreme.
2996507	2998048	It was beta testing and all that stuff.
2998388	3002110	How there were some onis for some of the older songs.
3002271	3004212	Just kind of like Little Bitch had some onis and stuff.
3004492	3007774	But there was one step chart that was going around forever that people were like...
3008945	3010246	I can't find this in the game.
3010346	3011707	This has got to be fake.
3011727	3013928	You know, it was the damn Darium Oni steps.
3013988	3018251	Well, come to find out, they were actually going to be in there, but they just cut them out at the last minute.
3018431	3025335	But thanks to the wonderful programming at Konami of Japan and their, you know, very buggy DDR Extreme,
3025715	3029279	You too can play these wonderful step charts that never made it in.
3029359	3035326	And don't tell me Xtreme does not feel rushed to any of you, because Xtreme is the most buggy of any DDR game they've released yet.
3035746	3036907	1998 just froze on me Thursday.
3036947	3039210	I played it first song, and it fucking freezes on me.
3040111	3044976	But the neat thing is, the arrows scroll by really fast to catch up, and you can still hit them if you're fast enough.
3045377	3046318	It's kind of challenging, but...
3047071	3047752	Also pisses you off.
3047832	3050294	But anyways, what you do is you do the Oni trick.
3050374	3062765	For those who are not familiar with the Oni trick, you have to go to an Oni selection screen or non-sub selection screen, and you kind of switch back and forth until you switch, I believe it's just above where you're looking for.
3063166	3065788	So say, for instance, you want to play Damn Darien with the Oni steps.
3066248	3069631	You pick a song, say, and what they've been doing is like the player's best.
3069972	3073235	So say Damn Darien is like number six in player's best.
3073695	3082503	So what you need is you need to get an Oni, a song with just Oni steps, so basically one of the Oni remixes, in number two, because, you know, they're going to match up.
3083263	3092572	So what you're going to do is you put it in there, and you switch real fast, and then when Damdarium comes up, it's going to have Oni steps on it, because you switched it really fast, and DDR Extreme is just really cool.
3093052	3099838	To kind of reiterate that point for those that might not be getting it, if you ever notice when you're switching around in the difficulties section,
3100058	3124674	for just a minute when you're spinning that wheel on the Oni courses if you're on something, let's say you're on an Oni course that has all heavy songs for just like a split second when you switch over to the one beneath it that might be a bunch of trick songs for like a split second those trick songs will be listed in green like it does that thing where it's collapsed and then it expands well like right as it expands it'll still be in that green color before it switches and that's the trick they're exploiting here
3125342	3131265	Yes, the new Oni steps, they've got Damodarium Singles and Doubles, which are okay.
3131285	3136247	They've got one for, what was it, Love Love Shine, that's new single Oni.
3136347	3140449	And then they have one that's just retarded for Blue Impulse.
3144223	3147646	All it is is completely blank and one freezer at the very end.
3147906	3151789	It looks like one of my edits that I did to kick the can years ago called Big Cans.
3152190	3155933	It's one arrow at the end of the whole thing.
3157054	3166882	That's the one where Rick and Timmy Nepal got off the machine and ran circles around Golf Land and then came back and hit the last step.
3168027	3177817	Yes, that was my edit to Big Cans, which I never did finish Big Cans will always be only half the song I never finished it It's gone, I think I deleted it Do you really?
3179598	3182081	I found one of my old missing memory cards that has my edits on it
3184474	3186555	I'm making a new Legend of Max edit, but um...
3209777	3218380	A new thing I was going to mention also, the last of the news, is there was a nice little bootleg upgrade on eBay recently.
3218420	3223862	It was Dance Dance Revolution Megamix, which included all the songs from 4th, 5th, and Extreme.
3224402	3229103	A nice little bootleg package there, which is actually still up for auction right now.
3229964	3233965	Or it says, seller ended the listing early because of the error in the listing.
3234465	3235866	The item has been relisted.
3236326	3237106	I don't see what they say.
3238783	3249546	What are you reading here?
3250046	3251246	I'm just reading the auction.
3251286	3256827	It says, this auction is for the 9th Dance Dance Revolution upgrade kit named Mega Mix.
3256867	3262068	This upgrade includes all the songs from 8th, 5th Mix, and 4th Mix games.
3262108	3264609	The kit includes Marquee, which looks like a piece of shit.
3265409	3265489	Um...
3266457	3272302	Upgrade instructions and software and hardware components to upgrade your third mix and higher DDR2 player machine.
3273703	3276185	Loki will link this eBay auction in the chatroom for all of you.
3276826	3279368	Yes, it is just a piece of shit.
3279848	3286294	Now, I noticed that you had posted about this over on Aaron in Japan, and they were all kind of going, obviously this isn't an official Konami release.
3286314	3288295	No, I did not post it on Aaron in Japan.
3288496	3290457	Okay, they had already had it posted in there.
3290517	3291879	I saw it actually earlier in the week.
3291899	3292299	Sorry, sorry.
3292759	3294401	And people started noticing it, but...
3298392	3305856	Duh, obviously it's a bootleg, but the most curious thing about this is whether it legitimately is 8th, 5th, and 4th or not.
3305976	3308517	I am knocking my shit over!
3308577	3309578	What are you doing?
3310198	3310958	What are you doing?
3311619	3312839	Those are my post-its!
3312959	3313780	No!
3314820	3315481	What the hell?
3315841	3318142	Shit, they have got information on them.
3318202	3319683	It's important information.
3322404	3323225	Gosh.
3323645	3323805	Sorry.
3323825	3323945	Sorry.
3326721	3327661	I like being overdramatic.
3327922	3336866	No, but anyways, no, it's a legit hack in the game, so it does have all the songs that it claims it has, it's just that no one spent time to create a marquee.
3338387	3342909	I don't believe that the guy is telling you that all the songs are in there, but I will not believe it until I see a video of it.
3343229	3343569	Period.
3345010	3345250	Why?
3345770	3348252	Because I just, it doesn't make sense.
3348472	3351673	I don't, because how do all those songs fit on a CD?
3352013	3354214	There's got to be some kind of switch or something.
3354234	3355175	They're doing something...
3356104	3359666	Either it's fake or there's something really low tech about it.
3360046	3360427	Easy!
3361007	3362608	Easy, you take out the videos.
3364609	3366931	Okay, so that's a possibility, but that's just what I want to know.
3367351	3368472	I want to know more about it.
3368752	3370413	It don't take up that much space.
3370593	3372314	It really is not that hard to do that.
3374015	3374195	Well.
3375516	3376277	I'm being a stubborn bastard.
3376297	3377518	Is it really only a dollar right now?
3377558	3378238	Maybe I should place a bid.
3378258	3379819	The reserve isn't met on that.
3379859	3382361	Obviously, the reserve price is going to be over $1,500.
3382401	3383001	I could bid $69 on it.
3383021	3383862	You could, but you won't win.
3406443	3407886	I said that he should give it to me for free.
3407906	3410170	I would laugh at whoever was stupid enough to bid on that.
3410490	3411853	Actually there were four bids last time.
3413752	3413912	Why?
3414152	3415334	I get it.
3415614	3416615	Okay, think about this.
3416695	3417136	Think about this.
3417416	3418016	Say you got it.
3418117	3418957	It's a bootleg machine.
3418977	3420119	You know that from the get-go.
3420139	3423122	You already have a bootleg machine that's not making any more money for you right now.
3423382	3425544	So what you do, you get a nice upgrade bootleg machine.
3425584	3427726	Anyway, since all of them are illegal over here anyways.
3428287	3432892	And you take that and you put it in your arcade next to your DDR Extreme, which is still making some money.
3433332	3434734	And then you make a new marquee for it.
3434874	3435715	And whoa, there you go.
3435735	3436896	You're assuming this thing works?
3438873	3440614	I wouldn't waste my money on anything.
3440654	3445056	Hey, all the bootlegs for Max 2 and DDR Extreme work, why would this be any different?
3446096	3451518	Because they're bootlegs in the sense that they are copies of Konami official things.
3452158	3453479	No, they are hacked hardware.
3453499	3457040	Somebody went in there and not only hacked the hardware, but hacked the programming.
3457640	3459281	Why is that a problem?
3460321	3462182	I don't believe it until I see a video.
3462222	3463042	What are they showing here?
3463262	3466103	They're showing a shoddy marquee.
3466798	3471159	and they're not showing any in-game shots, anything about the game itself.
3471199	3477862	We're all going off just what this guy says, which, you know, okay, maybe it's right, you know, but I just, I don't get it.
3477942	3478502	It doesn't make sense.
3478542	3480562	I want to know more about how this is actually operating.
3480602	3482463	Is it really all in one mix?
3482563	3487304	Is it like one of those Taiwan 64-in-1 games where you pick one of the games before you start the game?
3487985	3488985	What is this about?
3489425	3491246	I don't know enough about it and I would never spend $1,500 on it.
3491266	3491526	I would.
3491686	3492226	I would.
3492266	3493386	You're crazy.
3493486	3495147	If I had extra money, I'd definitely buy it.
3498817	3499417	You're very crazy.
3499437	3501258	Anyways, alright, so there's that.
3502119	3503239	It smells like burning in here.
3503699	3505620	Yeah, it smells like burning because VHG's cooking.
3506881	3507021	Hey!
3507261	3508241	You know what?
3508822	3509502	I don't like beer.
3510362	3511063	I know you don't like beer.
3511083	3514685	Oh yeah, you can drink all my Coronas and stuff that I've got in there because I bought those home for free.
3514705	3517566	Oh, I already told her she could have one.
3517586	3520627	Except I sort of like Corona because it doesn't taste like American beer.
3520647	3521828	Someone drink the pale ale.
3522468	3522728	Seriously.
3522748	3523269	I'll take them home.
3523769	3523889	Okay.
3526716	3530941	Okay, um, I think what we will do is we'll take another quick break.
3531282	3532403	Can I play something?
3532663	3533244	What do you want to play?
3533284	3534565	We should play that Paranoia remix.
3534585	3535466	Do you want to do your new mix?
3535867	3539191	Oh yeah, that's right, I was gonna, well, hmm.
3539671	3541534	Wait, wait, it's a game, it's a game, yeah.
3541974	3543375	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3543655	3544816	Talk about your new remix, Loki.
3545557	3556084	Well, earlier this week, we downloaded illegally off the internet because we watched the video about the bad things about piracy and how it hurts the record industry.
3556204	3556444	Right.
3556604	3561367	And then we said we don't care, so we went ahead and downloaded it anyways, since it sucked.
3561628	3566811	And we downloaded the brand new album for Enigma, Enigma 5, which...
3568448	3569829	I believe it's called Voyager.
3569969	3571210	Enigma, great band.
3571350	3574472	I love some of their stuff, like the Cross of Changes was an awesome album.
3574752	3577134	This new album, Voyager, fucking blows.
3577314	3579315	Well, don't you want to cue it up?
3579335	3579715	Yes, I do.
3579916	3580176	Sorry.
3580696	3583978	Anyways, there's a song on there called Boom Boom, which is kind of neat.
3584158	3587520	And so I mixed that with Echoes from 9th Style.
3588661	3594145	I got no boom boom echoed in my head remix.
3594446	3597568	So this is going to be interesting because a lot of you guys may not have heard Echoes before.
3597608	3602031	It's kind of one of the lesser known songs from Night Style, but it's got a pretty cool backbeat to it.
3602232	3606695	Yeah, and I just totally mixed it around, and that's actually pretty decent for a mix.
3606715	3609597	It wasn't hurried along at all, so it turned out pretty well.
3609737	3613941	Alright, so here it is, the world premiere here on Orange Lounge Radio of Loki's latest remix.
3614853	3617794	This is Boom Boom, the Echoed in My Head remix.
3618154	3620095	And it's Enigma vs. Dragoon.
3620315	3621475	Enigma vs. Dragoon.
3621535	3621955	We'll be back.
3780948	3785990	Alright, that was a world premiere of Boom Boom, originally by Enigma, but remixed right there by Loki.
3786030	3789471	The Echoed in My Head remix, so it had a little bit of echoes from Nightstyle in there.
3789571	3790291	So, what'd you guys think?
3790871	3791271	Boomy.
3795713	3802495	Your chair attracts more microphone cord than, like, a pimp attracts hose.
3802635	3803115	Here you go.
3803795	3804836	Uh, what'd you think of it, Bradley?
3804976	3805556	Sounded pretty cool.
3805876	3807317	Yeah, I liked it.
3807337	3808437	He definitely made that album better.
3810148	3811469	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3831499	3831939	Basically.
3832259	3840862	Although, I will say the fourth album has my favorite Enigma song ever on it, Gravity of Love, which has a cool video on it, as Loki saw last night.
3844863	3846864	So, yeah, Gravity of Love, good Enigma song.
3847564	3849805	The entire Voyager album, bad Enigma song.
3849985	3851705	Is the video like watching a Bjork video?
3852565	3855146	It's not quite that fucked, but it's like Eyes Wide Shut.
3856106	3856887	I haven't seen that movie.
3857527	3858047	It's pretty cool.
3860488	3860868	So...
3862506	3873430	Alright, so that was the Boom Boom Boom, uh, not Boom, sorry, not Boom Boom Boom, that's a Vengaboys song, that was Boom Boom, the, uh, Loki, you should mix Boom Boom with Boom Boom Boom.
3873970	3879051	Ah, that song that I wanted you to mix, I played it for Rob yesterday, Dutch Glockenspiel.
3879151	3879472	Oh yeah.
3880012	3881672	And I left the CD at home.
3882913	3883013	Eh.
3884355	3886097	Okay, we're going to break with some Bomani songs.
3886918	3888700	I'll play a couple songs that you can find.
3888740	3893965	There are Bomani songs that are typically in the game, but you can find them on the US VRare 2 soundtrack.
3895527	3897609	We're going to hear... Oh, we played that first break, yeah.
3897769	3904196	We're going to play the Bad Routine, and we'll play some Vanity Angel, because that's a good song.
3905037	3905217	And...
3907253	3909214	We can play the really shitty I Feel Mix.
3909555	3909955	Why not?
3909995	3911056	That's short.
3911736	3913297	Alright, we're going to do the I Feel Mix.
3913317	3915298	We'll start off with the I Feel Mix here.
3915338	3916699	The New Age... Here we go.
3916719	3918601	This is... Well, judge for yourself.
3918621	3921843	The New Age Hope Mix of I Feel is going to start off this break.
3921863	3924945	This is the New Age Put Me to... The Hope of Going to Sleep Mix.
3925185	3927407	And we will be back with the Orange Lounge Cage Match.
3928147	3928527	Yay!
3929228	3929808	Stay tuned.
3934091	3935212	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
3936713	3950965	and the CD is currently spinning we'll be back I feel I feel I feel
3961082	3964606	I feel... I feel... I feel... You will not hear the crappy I feel.
3964646	3965587	Because... Because...
3984719	3990322	Hello Flo, make me a sandwich!
4023358	4023961	Thanks for watching!
4068771	4069984	Thank you for watching!
4317248	4322914	Mr. Random Person on the Street, who by the way is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge Big Money Music and More show?
4323214	4330341	The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
4330682	4332664	It's unearthly.
4332904	4336628	It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
4337488	4339751	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
4341438	4345139	on this lovely Sunday evening here, episode number 63 in progress.
4345599	4348720	And we're going to get to the cage match in just a minute, but I want to ask you guys about this site.
4349060	4350941	A lot of you guys were looking at this before the show.
4351501	4355602	This is a site that somebody brought to my attention earlier this week in our chat room.
4355642	4360423	Just head on over to www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.
4360763	4364744	The site is sexiestgamer.com.
4366125	4367045	Have you guys seen this?
4367365	4370406	Hold on, I'll bring it up over here for you guys that haven't seen it yet.
4371647	4373428	And those of you that are listening, feel free to visit.
4377690	4381692	But basically what this website is all about is that there is this website, and I believe it's British.
4381893	4383273	Yes, Gamer.TV.
4385314	4387095	Gamer.TV is a British network, right?
4387556	4390957	They're trying to find the world's sexiest gamer.
4391398	4392078	And this is what they say.
4392118	4393799	They say, this is kind of what it's about here.
4394585	4395225	What gives?
4395805	4397446	There's booty for the best booty.
4397546	4399706	Find out what's at stake beyond your reputation.
4399746	4404607	So you look here, it says, this is what the whole idea behind Sexiest Gamer is about.
4405487	4410208	Our mission is to prove to the world that gamers are not joystick jockeys glued to their keyboard.
4410408	4418610	Our search for the sexiest gamer gives you, male and female gamers, the opportunity to send in your hottest gaming-related pic.
4419550	4422371	Visitors to the site will be able to rate the hotness of each entrant.
4422950	4425536	We all know that being a babe means different things to different people.
4425596	4426678	You don't need to be a supermodel.
4426758	4427380	Anyone can enter.
4427420	4428202	Time to get on down.
4429033	4434256	The first round of voting for all selected entrants starts on the 2nd of October and continues until the 20th of November.
4434337	4437338	Based on the first round of voting, 10 finalists will be selected.
4437399	4438759	Voting will then begin on the finalists.
4439240	4445104	On the 12th of December, 2003, a live grand finale will be held in front of a celebrity judging panel.
4445984	4455470	The finalists will be asked gaming and personality questions and based on their performance and their results from the second round of online voting, the judges will select the male and female winners.
4456931	4457772	And they win a trip.
4460043	4473215	I'm thinking that Orange Lounge has a large and sick enough fan base that maybe I should enter.
4476237	4476878	What do you guys think?
4476898	4477559	Should I enter this?
4480461	4482223	Would you guys vote me a 10 if I entered?
4486201	4486821	I'm serious.
4487281	4489582	I'm not going to do it if you guys aren't going to back me up.
4489622	4490822	And that includes the chat room.
4492382	4492682	Alright.
4495283	4495943	Where's your beer?
4507666	4508886	I don't know what happened to your beer, Jamie.
4510166	4512467	I have to think about... Jamie, what do you think?
4512527	4513167	Should I enter this?
4513187	4513267	Okay.
4518639	4518899	Yeah.
4520741	4521601	Would you enter it too?
4521741	4521901	No.
4522322	4522762	Why not?
4524123	4527705	I want some female needs to enter to represent Orange Lounge Radio.
4528426	4530247	Erin, I think you need to enter.
4531227	4533789	Yes, I think you need to enter the Sexiest Gamer competition with me.
4534309	4534970	It'll be me and you.
4534990	4535850	We're going to win that trip.
4536651	4541074	We will get our Orange Lounge Radio legions of fans to vote for us as Sexiest Gamer.
4542443	4548906	But this is the thing, is that there's so many assholes in the Bomani community that they're going to go and vote us a one just because it's us.
4549546	4554849	So we have to vote over and over and over them in order to pull this off.
4555589	4558270	If it's IP, log on to a dial-up account and do it.
4560572	4561032	I don't know.
4561112	4561952	I'm thinking about it.
4562833	4564633	We'll have more details as we go on.
4564814	4567495	But think about it, because if Aaron or I could win this thing,
4568234	4572337	Then we could go on to Gamer.TV and whore the shit out of this station.
4574979	4576901	Tell me that's not a beautiful idea.
4578602	4581244	All right.
4581744	4583646	Yes, we will wear sexy orange clothes.
4585127	4589490	We will wear nothing but orange lounge shirts in our pictures.
4589670	4590151	What?
4590951	4591772	An orange lounge suit?
4593273	4593874	No, I'm serious.
4593894	4595375	Aaron, are you going to enter this shit if I do it?
4597286	4602487	Alright.
4604628	4605388	I will see what we can do.
4605988	4606268	Alright.
4607309	4608989	Some more to come in future weeks on that.
4611970	4615170	We'll let you know next week where the sexiestgamer.com project stands.
4617371	4619752	In the meantime, how about we have ourselves a cage match?
4619772	4620492	How does that sound?
4620812	4621432	Sure!
4624321	4627082	Good, I'll give you guys some music to listen to while you're eating.
4628743	4637948	Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, it was another tie, but the winning song was a little bit surprising, at least to me anyway.
4638008	4646872	My song won, and it was a song that was suggested to me by The Ice Bitch, who hasn't been to a show in a while, but he suggested this before the show last week.
4647353	4649574	It's kind of a booty song, it's a song that maybe...
4650390	4653752	You could hear one day on Solo 2000, something like that.
4653772	4656074	This song is like the epitome of booties.
4657074	4658295	Well, here it is.
4658675	4661317	This is the song that won last week and the first song you can vote for tonight.
4661917	4665399	The way the cage match works, just a reminder, you have to be in our chat room to participate.
4665579	4667501	It is a listener-supported event.
4667681	4670863	www.callybomani.com Click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.
4671163	4672884	I'm going to play three songs for you guys.
4673224	4675806	After the three songs are over, you vote on your favorite.
4675826	4679328	The winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio and comes back next week.
4680290	4683272	So since this song won last week, you only get to hear a clip of it.
4684052	4688074	Here's last week's... No, sorry, you only get to hear a clip of it.
4688094	4688614	That's the rule.
4688794	4689775	It's not fair to the other songs.
4689815	4690795	It's not fair to the other songs.
4691176	4692616	This is song number one tonight.
4692656	4695958	The band is Fanny Pack, and the song is Camel Toe.
4696098	4696438	Enjoy.
4783232	4784452	Alright, that was song number one.
4785533	4787093	Fanny Pack with Camel Toe.
4788254	4788894	Last week's winner.
4788954	4790794	Okay, let's get on into our next song.
4790894	4792055	Next song will be Loki's song.
4792075	4793115	Why don't you tell us about it, Loki?
4795656	4802478	This song is featured on the Diverse Systems CD, Hello Boss, which is a remix CD of all Bomani music.
4803058	4808260	And they're done by these independent artists from Japan who do a lot of the BMS files you find out there.
4808400	4810761	And we're talking quality music.
4810781	4811601	The best
4812991	4814692	Beat Mania Files, if you ever find out there.
4816494	4820696	Definitely not this crap that you would see in, like, maybe, uh, I don't know, Tourney Mix or something like that.
4821137	4823738	But, um, no, this is really quality music.
4824079	4826921	Um, they sell a CD in Japan, Diverse Systems.
4826961	4832084	Anyway, this song is called, um, P8107.
4833665	4840690	Now, what the 8107 means, I don't know, but it's a remix of Paranoia that's fucking awesome, so...
4841158	4843063	This is Ono Ken with PH107
4994520	4995460	Okay, song number two.
4995480	4999121	Onokan with PB1, er, I'm sorry, P8107.
4999541	5000522	I keep reading that as PB.
5000562	5001522	I have peanut butter on my mind.
5001982	5005583	Let's go around and get votes from our studio.
5005903	5006283	Jamie.
5007064	5008904	Um, this one gets a 9.
5009364	5012185	The only reason it doesn't get a 10 is because it's more paranoia.
5014206	5014626	And that's it.
5015966	5017907	But other than that, it's like, damn, damn perfect.
5019504	5028955	I'll go next, I agree with Jamie, same score, I give it a 9, same reason, it's another paranoia, but it's very cool because it sounds like tack, and that's cool.
5030777	5031118	Loki!
5031919	5039788	It gets a 10 because it's the most awesome paranoia remake ever, and it will blow the crap out of whatever this paranoia respect piece of shit's gonna be.
5041109	5042950	So, it's way better.
5043090	5048652	And this is another example of how Konami has failed us as a company in producing a quality dancing game.
5049332	5057916	So, you know, you can really save yourself a lot of money and license some of these independent artists to make really kick-ass music for almost nothing.
5058456	5062258	But no, go ahead, license your expensive tracks that suck ass like wannabe.
5062558	5063058	That's fine.
5063278	5063638	Whatever.
5066140	5066900	Alright, moving on.
5066940	5067300	Let's see.
5067500	5068500	Jonas just arrived.
5068681	5069301	What do you have to say?
5070578	5072839	Well, 10 for Loki's reasons as well.
5073939	5078580	Well, this is like the only Paranoia Remix I actually think is one of the best of all time.
5080041	5084622	I don't know why the hell they have the speed of Paranoia Survivor.
5085402	5086703	Almost from 200 to 270.
5086783	5098266	And then you've got like Paranoia Evil, that's how it grabs like... You know Paranoia Red, which has almost no rhythm to it.
5099659	5103481	This blows the shit out of any fan-made Paranoia remix, basically.
5103501	5108805	The only one I could actually see acceptable was probably Paranoia Massive.
5108825	5110626	But I think this is a lot better.
5110646	5112107	Alright.
5113047	5115349	Does your friend that you brought along want to comment on this at all?
5117510	5123474	No, he's... Seven.
5124494	5125255	Alright, sadly...
5128976	5134040	Pretty good, but I'm not as impressed by it as you people are, but I'll give it an 8.
5135622	5136583	Okay, an 8 from Bradley.
5137764	5141907	Violent Hyper Girl, Chef Iron... Violent Chef Girl.
5144409	5149834	Okay, um, it was okay, it wasn't too bad, but it's still more paranoia yet again, so I guess an 8.
5149934	5155579	I mean, it's not so bad, but it wasn't really overly great, you know, like, oh my god, great.
5157054	5162559	Okay, and last but not least, Puppy.
5162599	5175069	When Loki first said online that he found a good Paranoia remix, I was like, either you're shitting me or the sun's about to explode, so I went outside to see if the sun exploded yet.
5175709	5184897	It hadn't, so I wasn't sure, but now that I've heard it, it's actually good, and I like it, and I give it a 10, and I just hope that we aren't all dead tomorrow.
5186041	5196332	Alright, chat room seems to really take a liking to that one, but you guys, it's not over yet, we have one more song in the cage match, and it's Jamie's entry, and why don't you tell us a little something about it, Jamie?
5196432	5198975	It's Delirium, after all, remixed by Samson and Ewan.
5199693	5201154	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5416180	5421762	Okay, that was song number three, Delirium, featuring Jael, with After All, the Svensson and Ghislaine mix.
5421822	5422122	Janie?
5423262	5423783	It gets ten.
5424803	5425183	That's it?
5426223	5426643	That's it.
5427484	5428244	I give it a nine.
5428564	5429524	Very nice.
5429624	5430305	Good vocal.
5430565	5435546	It's a good contrast to the other song, too, and certainly to song one, because it has vocals.
5437327	5437847	It's nice.
5438127	5438627	I like it.
5438807	5439187	I dig it.
5440128	5441528	Svensson and Ghislaine are the shit.
5442508	5444029	Loki is in the kitchen.
5450114	5451475	Both the women weren't so dirty.
5452075	5461881	Um... Fine, I'll make some of my instant rice in my rice cooker.
5462642	5463942	And it'll be instant goodness.
5464543	5465123	Anyways, nah.
5465844	5467565	Um... It was alright.
5467925	5473168	I've heard that song, like, numerous times on numerous CDs, so it's... Really worn out.
5474469	5474769	To me.
5475129	5475950	Plus, I have the CD.
5476110	5476810	It's somewhere around here.
5477971	5478071	Oh!
5480407	5481808	No, that's... yeah.
5483049	5483629	Well, alright.
5484249	5485670	But is it the Svensson and Gillen mix?
5487891	5488752	Give it a number already.
5489753	5494695	I give it number... two.
5495256	5496877	No, I give it a... eight.
5497497	5497917	That's cool.
5499098	5499919	Alright, moving on.
5499959	5500399	Jonas.
5503801	5504962	I'll give it a nine.
5504982	5508784	I like the song, the lyrics, the way they actually did the trance itself.
5509602	5512605	Does it make it sound like more GTS or generic kind of shit?
5514607	5515568	Alright, uh, Bradley.
5516609	5517349	That's pretty good.
5517389	5518090	I'll give it an 8.5.
5519711	5520392	SilentHyperGirl.
5521954	5522634	I think that was okay.
5522654	5523475	It wasn't too bad.
5523775	5526438	Nice, kind of, subtle fan.
5526898	5527259	Give it a 9.
5528826	5529307	Okay, sounds good.
5529627	5529908	Puppy?
5531831	5541267	Uh, it's a decent song, it just didn't really catch my attention and suck me in like any, like a song I like would have, so I was gonna A.
5542978	5544519	Alright, that's the votes.
5545559	5546280	That's interesting.
5546360	5549161	Both songs entered in tonight against last week's winner.
5549661	5553023	Nobody gave either one anything below an 8, which is kind of interesting.
5553043	5554344	I don't think that's ever happened before.
5554484	5556064	Usually somebody's giving somebody else a 4.
5557185	5558385	No, you can't change your vote.
5558405	5559146	It's too late.
5559906	5566049	So, all the songs are well liked by the studio tonight.
5566149	5567030	They're saying except number 1.
5567310	5569691	Well, number 1 won last week, so somebody liked it.
5571454	5578897	Here's a quick recap before we let you vote, and you'll be voting by sending private messages to Sky, but here you go, here's a quick recap.
5578937	5583839	Song number one, Fanny Pack with Camel Toe is the first song you can vote for tonight.
5591302	5593563	Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is P8107.
5607935	5613481	Alright, song number three you can vote for tonight is Delirium featuring Jaliel with After All, the Svensson and Ghislaine mix.
5626114	5629358	Alright, place vote now!
5634568	5641351	And if you don't know how to do that, you can either double click on somebody's name or you type slash msg sky and then your vote.
5646172	5648893	And you guys have about three minutes to place your votes for the cage match.
5649414	5654355	So, Jonas, you showed up before we got into cage match.
5654375	5654896	What's new with you?
5654936	5655756	We haven't seen you in a while.
5656256	5657056	Oh, not much.
5657116	5657977	College.
5659737	5660298	Made a few DWIs.
5663115	5665536	and you want to plug those, where can people find them and what are they called?
5665676	5672179	That's on my website, www.gameroom.com slash explicit.
5673900	5675420	Hold on, let me see if you type me that right.
5675440	5679762	Huh, what are you going to do here?
5680222	5682143	Just make sure you spell explicit right.
5682343	5682383	Oh.
5682443	5684904	You spell it wrong and you get the wrong link.
5687746	5688426	What's that?
5688546	5688566	3X.
5689597	5698960	Okay, XXXPLIZIT, okay.
5699900	5703761	Okay, so I'm going to post that site in the chat room for you guys if you want to visit the explicit site.
5703821	5704161	There it is.
5705202	5710443	Let me see, the last time I came here, I've only had like around 7 sim files.
5710503	5714084	Now I have like 11 released, including Paranoia Massive.
5714104	5716785	For those of you who want to try it out.
5719830	5721091	Who's the friend that you brought with you tonight?
5721771	5722412	That's my cousin.
5722992	5723653	Oh, your cousin.
5725154	5726995	Let's say hello to the cousin.
5730057	5731498	Oh, he's a little radio shy?
5734119	5735700	Oh, okay.
5736341	5736901	Hi, Erwin.
5737242	5737682	How you doing?
5739303	5739723	He's quiet.
5739763	5740243	All right, all right.
5740324	5740704	That's fine.
5740964	5741344	That's fine.
5745267	5745687	Let's see.
5745747	5746608	What else is new?
5747188	5748329	Loki, you got a minute over there?
5750260	5751340	You got a minute over there, Loki?
5753021	5753421	Here he comes.
5753681	5758002	I just wanted to know if you would tell us about... Don't tap the mic, because that goes out of the air.
5758322	5760262	If you'd tell us all what's going on in the sim world.
5761623	5763003	There's some stupid contest.
5763443	5767904	It's called TourneyMix 4.5+, my ass.
5769505	5771025	It's not important, so you shouldn't care.
5772441	5773041	TheFNDC.com
5793573	5810700	I thought the reason why they entered, like, made Tournament Mix 4 a plus is because people are, like, sick and tired of this anime and trance category being, plaguing, like, Tournament Mix 4.
5811161	5811541	I know.
5811801	5811961	What?
5812721	5817523	Let me bitch some more about my tournament that I'm holding.
5817623	5819564	Don't hold it then if you don't want to bitch about it.
5819584	5819744	I know.
5821779	5822780	We're not going to miss it.
5823160	5826161	Hello, there's a site called Bomani Sims, or should I say Bomani Style.
5826581	5828462	New music comes up there all the time.
5828582	5829042	And guess what?
5829102	5832084	It's not all trance and, you know, anime music.
5832284	5837626	Other music exists out there, but you limit everyone by what you can put in there so you don't get anything good.
5837726	5838366	Stop whining.
5838946	5843108	In fact, there's been some real shit on Bomani Style's system.
5843808	5848210	I think I've seen some country songs in there and just some weird shit.
5850953	5852154	Yes, I agree.
5852194	5854016	TurnMix is run by stupid people.
5855076	5856177	Well, some stupid people.
5856518	5859720	How the hell did they put Legend of Arc third place in TurnMix 4?
5861161	5864864	Well, think about all the work that went into it.
5865285	5868127	He shot his own video, he made his own steps, he made his own song.
5868167	5868968	I mean, that's pretty good.
5869348	5878836	As opposed to, like, I shit out steps for a song that I named wrong because I got it off of Kazaa, and I don't know what the real title is, so I'm going to say it's the Inspector Gadget theme.
5879236	5886164	Even though it's a classical piece, because I'm a stupid white person that doesn't know what real music is.
5887581	5888501	Here's a hint.
5888722	5892405	I would like to just give the tourney mix planners, the people that plan the next tourney mix, some advice.
5892685	5894707	And let me tell you something here, right out the gate.
5894967	5898270	No matter what you do, people are going to bitch that the contest sucks.
5898571	5900813	So don't even listen to us, don't listen to the chat room, whatever.
5900853	5902835	If you're happy doing your thing, do your thing, okay?
5903075	5906138	Because somebody's going to not like it, and you're just going to have to deal with that.
5906158	5908660	That's part of doing things and having a big tournament.
5909861	5910241	Thanks for watching!
5930851	5934692	Some sort of song that needs to have some audio quality set on it.
5934992	5937832	They need to be 192 or whatever quality.
5937852	5939953	They need to have some kind of audio quality set on it.
5939973	5942833	If they're not meeting these minimal standards, do not waste my bandwidth.
5943733	5945594	Number one, learn how to draw.
5945814	5946574	It's not that hard.
5946614	5951295	If you can't draw, take someone's picture, make it look nice, put a title on it, done.
5951435	5952475	Give credit where it's due.
5952815	5954435	Don't draw shit and paint.
5954555	5955535	It looks like crap.
5956156	5958376	And I've seen so many sim files where they...
5959156	5961479	The banner art and stuff is just like utter shit.
5961639	5962740	I don't care if you can't draw.
5962760	5963922	It's not that difficult.
5964322	5965824	Use fucking Photoshop filters.
5965964	5966845	It's not that hard.
5966985	5971110	I don't draw that much in Photoshop, but I use filters out of the ass, and it looks good.
5971250	5978358	So, just do that, and just, you know, pick good songs, you know, pick this crap, cut it good if, you know...
5979780	5983602	Make sure the steps sync and make sense and aren't insanely hard.
5983962	5989406	And number one of all things they should do is do not put who made the file on the file.
5990167	5998012	Because when you do that, you make people want to play these files because, oh, it's this person, and they won't play the file, they'll just vote because they like this person.
5998412	6001454	No, if you don't put, you know, what person is... BMR.
6002195	6004516	Yeah, what each file, who each file is made by.
6004536	6008619	If you don't put that on there until the very end, when all the voting is done,
6009339	6010999	Then you'll get a more fair vote.
6011099	6028163	But when you go ahead and put, you know, who made each file and all this stuff, and when you have people, you know, promoting their files like that, and I don't care if you promote your files, but the fact is that people are only voting, like, 30 people voted on one file, which might have been pretty good, but, you know, the ones that suck, like, Max, uh, whatever that was, I don't... Which one?
6028643	6028903	Neomax?
6029223	6030223	The Neomax.
6030503	6031544	Neomax, you know what?
6031804	6032224	Oh, wow.
6032564	6037025	Oh, you made your own little thing out of a MIDI program with, you know, fucking, um...
6037932	6067433	Fruity Loops, Whoopty Doo, Should I Pat You On Your Back I don't give a fucking shit if you made that song because it sucked it's just another Max remix that sucks so what if you put more work into it I put work into Legend of Trance and you know what I don't give a shit if it sucks it's fine you don't see me bitching about it but here's the thing everyone's like oh it's the BNCDR it's so cool no I'm sorry the thing I just played a little bit ago you know the Paranoia remix that was 100,000 times better than your fucking song okay that's what I have to say about that
6068484	6079710	Now, in fact, that's another thing, is people are like, oh, well, I wanna, you know, vote for this, because, and they didn't really play the song, they just, you know, voted for it because they're like, oh, and you know, Max is so cool, oh my god, this guy can be in DDR, oh!
6079730	6081091	That also gets me to one point.
6082032	6083232	Like, you know Boomerang, right?
6083252	6084853	He's been done by BMR, right?
6085113	6089356	He just re-edited the steps, put it on, people just overrate his ass, and...
6090041	6095327	With some of the things I've heard out of there, I think that a very loud fart would sound better than some of those.
6096749	6099372	And I thought he quit making sim files like three years ago.
6099412	6100193	Come on now.
6100934	6108403	Here's, okay, here's my, this is why maybe, I'm just going to kind of play devil's advocate here and tell you why maybe they have not gone to the anonymous system.
6109346	6112989	Let's say you submit a file to the Tourney Mix and it's anonymous, whatever.
6113289	6114150	But let's say I do it.
6114410	6116992	Now, everybody knows I'm not going to enter Tourney Mix because I know I'm not talented enough.
6117472	6126619	I go in and then I come on this station and say, Oh, hey, by the way, you guys, I entered 2 Become 1 by the Spice Girls in the contest and you all need to go vote for it at 10.
6126919	6128800	Well, there, I've just fucked up the whole anonymous thing.
6129101	6132983	How are you going to keep 200 people quiet and not get their friends to go on there and vote their songs 10?
6133564	6134605	That's why the anonymous thing...
6135185	6136346	Probably has not been tested.
6136647	6140651	Now, you could say, oh, if we find you, we'll get you, but you know that's not going to work.
6140972	6141713	You're not Big Brother.
6141753	6143615	You can't see everywhere and stuff, you know, so.
6145537	6146378	Any comments on that, Loki?
6146418	6150903	I was just going to say, do you have any comments on that?
6150924	6153527	Because I was playing devil's advocate to your anonymous idea.
6154087	6155269	I wasn't listening to what you were saying.
6156283	6156923	Okay, real quick.
6158204	6163648	Let's say I submit an entry, and then I come on Orange Lounge Radio and say, Hey guys, look for my entry such and such.
6164008	6164828	Vote for it at 10.
6165089	6167370	Well, now haven't I just ruined the whole anonymous thing?
6170752	6172613	No, because guess what?
6172733	6175095	Not everyone gets on this radio show and promotes their thoughts except for me.
6176755	6179817	But what about, let's take somebody like the well-known people.
6180157	6188022	This is what you're trying to prevent, is you're trying to prevent the well-known people from winning every time, basically, just because of the well-known ones, and they're the ones who get their files downloaded.
6188302	6192644	Well, now all these well-known people post on boards, and some of them will post their own shit.
6192664	6194746	They're proud of their stuff, as they should be.
6194866	6196667	Well, fine, just make a rule against it.
6196687	6197387	That's pretty easy.
6197567	6199869	It's like they didn't rule about distributing files.
6200469	6201910	But you're not Big Brother, you can't see everything.
6203274	6216125	Yeah, but there's thousands of little minions of mine that are running around boards that are waiting to, you know, fucking, you know, turn this bastard in because they also have a sim file posted in TourneyMix, you know, because they have, like, 300 people entering this goddamn piece of shit.
6216886	6224533	So, obviously, you've got, you know, 300 people looking for their files on all these boards, so trust me, it gets covered pretty easy.
6225754	6226094	Alright.
6226542	6229625	Oh yeah, um, can I say something about the turn mixes and all the sim files?
6229705	6230386	Oh hell why not.
6230787	6238114	Well, there's like a lot of people I know that are like underrated and making sim files, but when I download some of them, they're actually hella good, just for the quality of the steps.
6238174	6241518	That's another thing, when is Civis, okay, the guy that's fuckin',
6241878	6244560	Runs DDR, EI What's he know about sim files?
6244620	6246382	I don't see him making shit, okay?
6246462	6246962	Now where is he?
6246982	6264697	You got like Moogle Hunter, he knows how to make sim files Now he would be a good judge Amani Ruler, he's made sim files I bet he writes hard files, that's the only problem Hey, it's fine, he's made sim files He ran a sim file site that's different You know, you've got the guy Those people Those should be the judges we have
6265397	6270262	What are all these other people going like, oh, your file sucks ass because I don't like trance music.
6270482	6274907	I'm sorry you don't like trance music, but you know what, that doesn't have anything to do with this.
6275247	6276428	They're judging the song.
6276569	6277550	I don't like this song.
6277670	6278911	It's a sim file contest.
6278951	6280913	It's about the file, not the fucking song.
6281313	6282655	I don't care if you don't like this song.
6283295	6288041	Or like people who made those SM errors, you know, Step Mania errors Oh yeah, Step Mania sucks!
6288221	6301176	Well that's maybe if DWI fucking updated their goddamn program within the last six months You know, we'd have people using that But I'm sorry, because Step Mania is like 100,000 times better than DWI So why don't you just have a Step Mania contest?
6301716	6302656	I know, seriously.
6303036	6307038	Because they're maniacs, so people can make files easy.
6307298	6309539	Because they're not doing it old school in Notepad.
6310599	6312780	Cry, cry, cry some more for me.
6312800	6314801	It doesn't matter if it's just Notepad or anything.
6314861	6316541	It's the way the quality of stuff is.
6317001	6318662	If you have something bust up with, like,
6321813	6330718	The whole point of this thing and the argument we get down to at the very end every time is that this tournament sucks.
6331218	6333939	Tournament sucks, just don't enter it, just whatever.
6334299	6342563	That's what I do, I don't enter it, I don't give a shit, I just at the very end, I download the files, weed out like the ten that are any good and delete the rest.
6342683	6344044	And that's what I do with everything.
6344687	6352373	I don't know, it looks like turnmix is like a bias, because anyone can throw like a porno video and get a number one spot on the turnmix, even though there's just a porno.
6352573	6353314	It's just a big joke.
6353374	6354375	The whole thing's a joke.
6354875	6357017	It was good when it was just like a little fun contest.
6357037	6357698	Turnmix 1!
6357878	6362021	We're going to make this a biannual thing where we, you know, do this and everyone's looking up to it.
6362261	6363262	Who gives a shit?
6363302	6365184	It's just a fucking contest.
6365224	6367826	Well, I was thinking about entering turnmix 4 plus just for the hell of it.
6368246	6369968	Use that existing sim file.
6371028	6372670	I think I'm going to use that song for wins.
6374525	6380933	I just, I don't care anymore because, you know, if I want to get quality sim files, they're not made by U.S.
6380973	6381293	people.
6381433	6383315	They're the Japanese people that are making the sim files.
6383536	6387500	They're the people back from when, you know, Dance Dance Evolution, that site was around.
6387520	6393347	Back when, you know, Fifth Mix was coming out for the arcade and sim files were coming up for that back in Delight Deliverance.
6393547	6395608	Duplication.
6396029	6397350	This site was up.
6397650	6401612	This was the only place where you can get all your official steps.
6401632	6403914	This was the site, and it was run by Japanese people.
6404154	6411979	And they also had originals, which had all difficulties, and they were intelligent steps, really nice backgrounds, professional, done everything.
6412360	6412860	And you know what?
6412900	6417123	When that site died, people didn't realize that the small site with the originals is still up.
6417423	6418063	And you know what?
6418144	6423227	I get sim files from there, and they're 100,000 times better than all these stupid sim files that people make.
6423787	6426429	I think we need to change the pace, what do the rest of you think?
6452611	6454933	Let's see, how about we announce the winner of the cage match?
6457335	6458195	Sorry about the delay.
6458596	6459196	No, that's alright.
6459557	6460737	Everybody needs to vent once in a while.
6460757	6462099	That's why we have the FUs coming up.
6464320	6464921	Oh yeah.
6465141	6466882	You two need to keep a quota tonight though.
6466902	6469324	You just bitched for about five minutes there.
6469725	6471546	So that comes off your FU times.
6472146	6472467	Alright.
6474077	6476078	Yeah, yeah, Loki's like, I'll drop it from 20 to 19.
6477219	6483923	Okay, tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge Cage Match, I have to say this, song number one, my pick, didn't get a single vote.
6484964	6495190	So, we had last week's winner did not get a single vote, and between the other two, fairly close, a lot of people voting, but in the end, the winner was P8107.
6503635	6507897	People felt very strongly about one song or the other, though, just looking in our chat room.
6507937	6514680	So we'll just see what happens next week when P8107 comes back and does battle against two new picks.
6518042	6520563	There's also another song that Onokid did.
6520903	6522904	You can play it later on break.
6523504	6524265	We'll do that later.
6524505	6525025	Hi, Jamie.
6525886	6525946	Hi.
6527262	6528223	I took a nap during the rant.
6528283	6529683	I did, because Corona makes me sleepy.
6529703	6530804	I need to go club a seal.
6546676	6547057	Okay.
6547137	6547457	Alright.
6550661	6551542	Alright, we'll be back.
6551562	6552463	We're going to take a quick break.
6552483	6559792	We're going to start off, I thought we'd start this off with Echoes from Nightstyle, so those of you that were listening to Loki's remix before can kind of hear what he had changed and all that stuff.
6560253	6561254	And then some other stuff.
6561655	6563657	Something from Guitar Freaks, something else from Nightstyle.
6564058	6564979	We will be back.
6567995	6569536	Oops, I have to say really fast.
6569696	6569957	Sorry.
6570657	6574000	Send your FUs of the week now because we're doing that when we come back in our chat room.
6574200	6577603	www.calibermoney.com Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.
6578243	6578984	Let's try that again.
6579044	6579925	Dragoon with Echoes.
6707988	6710249	Music Music Music Music
6741744	6742785	Thank you for watching!
6909369	6917955	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
6918055	6923939	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
6924580	6928382	Hello everybody, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, we hope you're having a good time listening.
6928523	6931825	Episode number 63 in progress, we're going to get to the FUs of the week, but first...
6933312	6936474	Some quick station housekeeping announcements and things like that.
6936494	6943440	Just a reminder, we do have other shows here on Orange Lounge Radio now on Monday nights at 7 o'clock.
6943960	6951867	Me, Vanilla Sky is the show, and Rice Princess and Lanky Style also come over and visit, and Loki makes cameos all the time.
6952547	6956370	And we talk about game news and then other stuff going on.
6956430	6961014	And tomorrow night's show, I will make my official endorsement for California Governor.
6961054	6961935	And since my initial...
6962515	6963396	The answer is... Unicron.
6980049	6981090	Jamie, what's on Tuesdays?
6981530	6984072	Tuesday is Pump Up the Volume, which is my request show.
6984512	6986854	If you're hanging out in the chat room, make a request.
6986974	6990176	You might hear what you want played, because I have tons and tons and tons of MP3s.
6990777	6995900	So, that's where I basically hold up my hand, extend the middle finger toward the RIAA.
6999369	7028841	But I'm thinking of breaking out, I picked up the soundtrack for Initial D Special Stage Which is the PS2 Initial D game And I might play some stuff off of that Oh great, Nostylan's going to want to make love to you for that one He's been saying Eurobeat randomly in the chatroom for like the past three days Eurobeat, Eurobeat, more Eurobeat Then probably before the show we should, you know, send him the gift of a plastic keyboard cover Yes, that's probably a good idea
7029696	7030838	and maybe a blow-up doll.
7032259	7033561	Yeah.
7033601	7033901	Next.
7034422	7037906	Wednesday nights, there's nothing right now.
7038027	7040310	And Thursday nights, Livewire's on hiatus until November.
7041090	7041311	Right.
7041912	7043554	That is correct.
7044094	7045957	It's on break.
7046619	7049962	I'm building a cabinet and I need extra days.
7051103	7053245	Also, working on something else for 2004.
7054606	7061052	I like to call it the SC2K4 project, which only I think one other person knows about.
7062233	7065116	And it's going to be very, very complex if I pull it off.
7066892	7069033	That's something to look forward to in 2004.
7069694	7074916	Also, something else to look forward to in about one month, Orange Lounge Radio is going to be upping the stream quality.
7075116	7077418	Don't worry, modem listeners will not be shut out.
7078197	7099676	Modem listeners will still be able to connect as always, and it's going to be great, because the music is going to sound, if you have the correct codec loaded into Winamp, and if you don't, it's okay, the station will still play, it won't sound as good, but it'll still sound better than it does now even, but it's going to play DSL quality radio on a 56k stream, so it'll be really nice for some of you guys.
7099996	7102518	That's in about one month, as soon as Live365 gets all their...
7105458	7108900	We're also extending another kick to the 23rd Magus.
7112002	7112942	For being stupid.
7114803	7115103	Alright.
7116884	7117304	There it is.
7118945	7125489	Alright, so now I think, Jamie, it's your turn to take the stage and give us some rants.
7125529	7126169	How's that sound?
7126249	7126489	Sure.
7127670	7127850	Oops.
7142216	7147038	My first FU of the week goes toward this fan for blowing dust directly up my nose.
7151200	7154921	The next one goes to my house for being dirty because I work all the time.
7155722	7161364	So we cleaned the house today and my allergies wanted to, you know, murder me through my nose.
7162543	7164985	I was going to be dead, but I took a shower instead.
7166426	7169748	Another one goes toward Corona and Apple Juice for making me burpy.
7170269	7172530	This is the sparkling apple juice, which is the best stuff in the world.
7174452	7179595	Another F you goes toward all the stupid people that were on the road today.
7179775	7183218	I hate them all and wish that they would wreck their cars far away from me.
7184779	7190303	And another one goes to the stinky old man in my apartment complex who walks around smoking cigars.
7191574	7193715	Really stinky cheap cigars.
7194296	7201560	And the thing about really stinky cheap cigars is that they make me so nauseous smelling them that I have been known to throw up before.
7202801	7203841	Yeah, very disgusting.
7204481	7211345	So this old man stops me because I usually, you know, just sort of tuck my hand under my nose when I walk past him so I don't have to smell it.
7212868	7214970	and he's like, hey, do you have a problem?
7215250	7216171	Do you have a problem?
7216631	7221394	And I just kept walking, but next time he does that, I'm going to say, yeah, it's you and your stinky smoke, so.
7224817	7227359	I have a problem with how he stinks and what I have a problem with.
7229193	7235036	Another one goes toward my car in Meineke for misdiagnosing my car.
7235076	7236737	Potentially it may not be the head gasket.
7236777	7238618	It may be the valve job.
7239538	7244081	And another F you goes to all the people who have said that they're going to sign up for my message board and haven't yet.
7245561	7253766	It's just... It's... I don't... That's why I said the people who said they were going to sign up and didn't.
7255346	7258028	It's... It's, uh...
7258880	7261903	roleplay.darksakura.com, sign up for it or I'll kill you.
7264386	7265147	That was beautiful.
7267349	7277720	And another FU goes toward not having all the information that's needed to set up a particular server for a particular game.
7278641	7278901	Right?
7280643	7281564	Sorry, I missed that.
7282595	7284215	Thank you for watching!
7284235	7285496	See you next time!
7308323	7316852	I feel to myself for mis-measuring every single aspect of everything on my DDR pads, thus making them one hell of a mismatch of pieces.
7317493	7325402	But they still turned out okay, it's just that everything's mis-measured and sticking out in places and stuff like that that shouldn't be.
7328775	7351387	F you to old people because you drive too slow and you should die F you to DMV for not sending me my tags yet because I got pulled over by a cop who was saying that my registration was expired but then after checking with his little dispatcher found out that my registration wasn't expired so that's pulling me over for no reason but he was nice about it and didn't write me a ticket like the guy last year
7353268	7361252	and then F you to all the women that are saying Arnold Schwarzenegger molested them in some way.
7361532	7362993	You know you wanted a piece of that.
7363493	7365094	You know you did.
7365514	7366695	He's a big hunky guy.
7366735	7368375	Don't tell me you didn't want any of that.
7369936	7374778	You're just mad now that he's becoming a political figure and you're not with that.
7375179	7376039	So don't be a hater.
7376379	7377060	Don't be a hater.
7378400	7384342	And don't tell me that this stuff isn't totally just because he's going to win the election.
7384602	7394005	Because that's why you're coming out a few days before like, Oh, I just now got the courage to tell you guys that he molested me or touched my ass or something like that.
7395365	7403693	Whatever, like, it's like a big coincidence, like, we don't know this, and Davis is like, oh, I didn't pay these people at all to say this stuff, not at all.
7404774	7411500	Um, so F you to them, and, um, F you to, um, Roy, because you got mauled by a tiger, and you know what?
7414018	7418043	Maybe if you weren't like, you know, such, you know.
7418263	7420766	The tiger was jealous because you weren't showing it any love.
7420846	7423810	You were loving the other lions and tigers and bears, oh my.
7424231	7424371	Oh my.
7427691	7431794	See, the tiger just couldn't understand why you like the small penis but not the big penis.
7432035	7433256	So, whatever.
7434657	7441682	Anyways, F you to Game Show Network for airing that show called Who Wants to Be the Governor of California?
7441803	7444385	Never in my life have I seen a more retarded show.
7446226	7450249	If anything, Mary Carey should never run for office ever.
7450289	7453973	In fact, she should just kind of disappear because no one wants to hear her talk.
7454713	7455634	Because she's an idiot.
7456261	7457262	A complete idiot.
7457702	7458242	But you know what?
7458582	7460243	This is why I think she should win.
7460643	7465406	Because I would like, at this point, to see California just crash and burn.
7466006	7470909	Like the big, um, space shuttle crash earlier, you know?
7471529	7478573	Yeah, it's just like... Just... Just burn.
7478833	7481414	I just want to see it go down and just die.
7481914	7483695	California just needs to die.
7484235	7484556	You know?
7485656	7491998	And, um, oh yeah, F you to, um, the government for actually searching for weapons of mass destruction.
7492778	7493698	You ain't gonna find them.
7496239	7498439	Stop wasting, just, just cop to it.
7498739	7503260	You know, we didn't like, we made up that there were, you know, weapons of mass destruction.
7503440	7504060	So what are you gonna do?
7504100	7505921	We already destroyed them and now we're rebuilding them.
7505941	7507241	Get over it.
7507421	7514883	And, um, F you to the fact that, like, um, I can't vote on the recall thing because I didn't re-register.
7515464	7515964	That sucks.
7518086	7529474	F you to certain websites out there, maybe Flamani related, that have little flash or shockwave animations that play MUSIC WHEN YOU GO TO THEIR GODDAMN SITE!
7529635	7532757	I'm gonna say this every week until you fucking turn that shit off.
7533257	7535099	No one wants to hear it, it's annoying.
7535599	7536119	Turn it off.
7537040	7538321	Your little flash animation?
7538501	7538821	Cool.
7539222	7539542	Music?
7539702	7540182	Not cool.
7542184	7543325	I think I'm done.
7545283	7545743	Finally.
7548644	7549505	F you to sports.
7550245	7550785	I don't care.
7552586	7553466	Why do the rest of you?
7555106	7557907	F you to Dave and Buster's because everything's so expensive there.
7557947	7560488	And you kicked everyone out at 10.30 that was under 18.
7561068	7562169	Or, I mean, under 21.
7562209	7562789	Sorry.
7563389	7564289	Over 18, but under 21.
7564909	7566070	And, you know, screw that.
7566130	7566710	We were there.
7566770	7567870	We were their escorts.
7567930	7569151	We were their parents for the evening.
7569191	7570091	Why you gotta kick them out?
7570391	7571311	They weren't drinking.
7572052	7572832	Most of them weren't.
7574730	7575631	Thanks for watching!
7595498	7596539	I think that's pretty much it.
7596579	7597479	I don't have a lot of FUs.
7597619	7598540	FU to the recall.
7599921	7601902	I just can't wait until this whole stupid thing is over.
7601942	7603323	It should never happen in the first place.
7605104	7608246	And FU to cell phones going off mid-show.
7608687	7609227	Just kidding.
7610028	7610408	I'm kidding.
7610748	7611829	Oh, come on, Aaron.
7613089	7613970	Yours does it all the time.
7614170	7614651	So does mine.
7615111	7615611	I'm kidding.
7620524	7631428	OFU to Walmart, Target, and the bookstore, and Ralph's, and the paper store in the Folsom Outlets because none of them carry giant birthday cards.
7631989	7634409	And I'm too lazy to go all the way to Sunrise Mall.
7635830	7640512	You people need to be more practical and think about my needs because the world revolves around me.
7643493	7643733	Thank you.
7645074	7645714	Alright, I'm done.
7645754	7647555	Let's hear from the rest of the room, shall we?
7647595	7648135	Starting with
7649110	7650071	Dare I say it, Jonas.
7663427	7668111	Tick Tock Tick Tock Victor, my name is not meant to be written in late, so stop it.
7671333	7673575	First of all, fuck the IAA.
7674435	7674996	Definitely.
7675556	7677878	No one wants to pay $20 for your shit.
7678378	7680560	Come on, we've downloaded MP3s for a reason.
7681381	7683642	To just try and see if it's a good music and all.
7686605	7688506	Who wants to spend $20 for sucky songs?
7692611	7693452	Yeah, exactly.
7695273	7697575	Okay.
7697775	7699676	Fuck some pigeons, try to shit on my car.
7701397	7703058	Yeah, I have to clean it up and shit.
7704435	7706135	I saw some dog trying to lick my balls off.
7706315	7713777	Okay, I have to ask, what were you doing with your balls exposed to a dog so they can lick them?
7714077	7718158	Okay, I was outside, um, running, and suddenly some dog tried chasing me.
7718738	7723739	Remember, it's not cheating if you put peanut, smear peanut butter all over your balls and have a dog lick it off.
7726080	7726540	Ballpark.
7726580	7727620	I love that show.
7733923	7734704	Let Jonas finish, Aaron.
7735144	7736144	He's not going to cut you off.
7736164	7737125	Don't cut him off.
7737305	7737925	Good job, Jonas.
7737945	7739346	Everybody give Jonas a hand.
7739386	7739646	Good job.
7739666	7740307	That's how to do it.
7740327	7740487	Good job.
7740507	7743909	Alright, Aaron, your turn.
7763227	7766269	I guess Greg and Claudio agree on me with this.
7766489	7767570	FU to math homework.
7767890	7773594	Lots and lots and lots of math homework and we have a test in like a week, unfortunately.
7773974	7774835	Goddamn midterm.
7776416	7782780	Um, FU to stinky people who play Initial D. Or it's that particular large, fat...
7784358	7789202	Nerdy-looking, smelly guy that beat Claudia at initial D. She knows who I'm talking about.
7789502	7797208	He's the equivalent of one of those really, really fat, like, glasses-wearing anime nerds who take Japanese just to figure out what they're saying.
7797708	7799149	You can watch their anime episodes.
7799589	7800410	Et cetera, et cetera.
7802972	7804393	And... let's see...
7805089	7816271	FU to Sean Davis of ECS30, who's not teaching us any programming, who is going straight through everything and not actually teaching, because I don't know anything about programming.
7817012	7818612	And, yeah, I think that's it.
7819392	7825113	And, oh, and FU to, um, FU to Nosan for Parra in IRC.
7825473	7826794	Parra is dead!
7827994	7828794	Get over it!
7829614	7832255	That was the one Bomani game nobody was playing in Miggle yesterday.
7833715	7838697	I'm going to make Paras once I get my controller and get it running in Step Mania.
7838717	7840237	I'm going to make Paras for Mac 300.
7840597	7843599	I'm going to work on my X-rated Para game.
7846119	7846940	I'd play that.
7848040	7849881	I will bring Para back single-handedly.
7850381	7851441	Or double-handedly.
7852222	7853882	Double-handedly depending on the technique.
7856485	7865211	Well, see, it's not that I hate all these little freaks saying that, oh, it's going to come back, it's going to come back.
7865712	7866813	We're playing for fun.
7866873	7868934	God, it's not a fucking community anymore.
7870135	7871396	Okay, I'm done.
7871656	7872517	Oh, one more real quick.
7872537	7873998	Let me squeeze in there.
7876490	7888357	F you to this really crappy movie, The Oral Adventures of Kraven Moorhead, number 17, because it was really dumb, and I just wasted my time watching it.
7888797	7889657	It was hilarious, I guess.
7890338	7891498	I have another one to put in.
7892059	7897162	F you to Workload57 for being the most boring and shittiest class on all of Earth.
7897242	7898483	I want to die now!
7899583	7899823	Bradley!
7899843	7902045	Wait up.
7904933	7909714	Fuck you to the job market and being evil and stuff like that.
7909814	7914196	Fuck you to waiting to find out if I got a job or not.
7915416	7918157	Fuck you for being discouraged that I probably won't.
7919457	7921798	That I didn't do well enough or something.
7922718	7924119	Let's see, what else?
7924159	7929180	Fuck you to... Let's see, what else?
7929200	7932181	Fuck you to squandering my money for...
7932918	7937519	being lazy for way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way too long.
7938940	7942941	And fuck you to stupid Americans who don't know math and hate math homework.
7943321	7943981	Math rules!
7949122	7952303	Yes, I was a math major and chemistry.
7953623	7954663	I like, yes, well.
7954683	7959125	That's because I'm lazy, that's not because I know math.
7959145	7959445	Zing!
7962939	7963660	I can do anything!
7963980	7971807	Hey, he's been able to stay unemployed this whole time because he knows finance, thanks to that.
7972587	7977752	He knows how to budget out those unemployment or whatever, however he's doing it, so... There you go.
7977772	7978953	I should have never been on unemployment.
7980154	7981535	Well, we don't need to get into personal life.
7981555	7983737	I would actually wish I would have gotten onto it, like, sometime.
7983757	7988201	Yeah, but I'm not a student anymore.
7999986	8005491	Just to interject something here, think freely Roy, the show is probably going to be cancelled forever.
8005872	8006192	YES!
8012218	8014200	Will you please tell that to everybody, Nelly?
8016468	8019789	I'd like the world to hear the wisdom of Nellie here because she makes a good point.
8019849	8020149	Alright.
8021270	8022010	I forgot it already.
8022290	8023731	Alright puppy, your turn.
8025471	8028453	I'd like to begin by saying fuck you to the following ionic compounds.
8028733	8033494	Silver sulfide, Stano-sulfate... DO NOT BRING CHEMISTRY ON TO THIS PROGRAM!
8035355	8040637	I had to... Okay, I'm... I'm sitting here working on this fucking chemistry homework right now!
8040897	8042678	It's... That's how bad it is!
8043658	8045599	It just fucked chemistry all together.
8046240	8049402	Because I hate having to do busy work like this.
8050502	8051643	And it's not helping me any.
8053183	8058926	I still have to do, uh, one, two, three... A good four more pages worth of writing chemical formulas.
8059607	8060087	For homework.
8061718	8061978	Yeah.
8062919	8066122	And it's annoying and it's a pain in the ass and yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda.
8067383	8068224	And, let's see here.
8069645	8077751	Uh, I, fuck any, fuck all non-working ATMs in the city of Davis, which is the large majority of ATMs.
8078892	8084877	Yes, the People's Republic of, I actually took that real life comic and put it up as my desktop picture on my computer.
8084917	8087740	Yes, Davis made famous by real life this week, that comic.
8089040	8091241	The guy who draws us from the same town we are.
8095862	8106706	Fuck the people at the UC Davis arcade for taking way too fucking long to go through applications for jobs because it's been a month since I turned in my application and they still haven't reviewed it yet.
8109600	8112281	I noticed this theme of lazy employers tonight.
8112301	8113961	Oh, really now?
8114661	8118963	Because actually, there's an EV Games opening today, so I'm going to go apply for a job there, too.
8121763	8123664	Poppy's going to work for the enemy of Jamie.
8123744	8124884	I have no enemies.
8125865	8126705	I don't make enemies.
8128305	8130246	Can't we all just get along?
8130266	8133487	I have another one that I provide.
8134787	8138088	I think it's like you just whoever made Murder Burger changed their name.
8138601	8144102	Because as cool as it is to have Red Rum Burger, it was so cool to have Murder Burger.
8144242	8145103	I need to go eat there.
8145263	8148223	On the right side, we just found out there's a Red Rum Burger in Folsom.
8149204	8150324	And we're going to go there for one night.
8150424	8153905	I haven't had Murder Burgers yet because it's on Sutter Street.
8155745	8163827	Just to answer, puppy, I wanted red meat because I really wanted a hamburger.
8164247	8166928	But I don't eat beef anymore and I can't really digest it very well.
8167679	8168980	So, I had an ostrich burger.
8169820	8170601	Ostrich sounds... strange.
8171061	8171681	It's yummy.
8171862	8172402	It's really yummy.
8174403	8175804	Anyway, um, who's next?
8179406	8180046	Yes, Helen?
8181327	8186590	F you go to, uh, TapX Tads in Davis, because we opened them up, what, Friday night?
8187291	8190813	And we found the cool... we found enough soil to pot a plant.
8192174	8192874	So, yeah.
8193274	8193775	Yeah!
8194975	8199138	It's that bad, so yeah, F you to TapX for never seeing this happen.
8202761	8204082	Actually, F you to the minions, Dark.
8204482	8211327	Alright, let's move on to chatroom F you, shall we?
8211967	8212848	Please, less.
8213709	8215430	And we will comment on them and make fun of them.
8215890	8220493	AZN Buddy Paul says, F you to schoolwork and F you to negativity.
8220594	8221034	That's it.
8224844	8232168	Chaos would like to say, F you to Love is Drowning, original soundtrack version from Nightstyle, because the singing makes my ears bleed.
8233188	8234189	Is that a Politary song?
8235229	8235809	I don't know.
8237570	8240512	Oh, we need to play that new Politary song that Loki found a little later.
8241252	8244614	Maybe we'll save that for next week, or maybe we'll do it when we come back after F yous.
8246634	8252195	Baka would like to say, my FU of the week goes to initial D players of Riptide for being such pains in the asses.
8252635	8257256	Bastards hog the machine and hog the F-Zero machine and call it the initial D on crack.
8257716	8260276	They don't know shit about F-Zero and why do they play it?
8260336	8262097	Because the machine gives out free cards.
8262217	8262697	Bastards.
8263137	8264477	VH2 would like to respond to you.
8265177	8266717	Well, tell us something we don't know.
8266797	8267398	Come on now.
8268438	8273759	Every time I go here, it's like all the same things.
8275279	8275579	Alright.
8276582	8280643	Ninst would like to say F you to the entirety of my college physics department.
8281103	8283904	All the professors have a different thing wrong with them and none of them can teach.
8286165	8287425	That's the same thing at every school.
8288805	8292486	23rd Magus would like to say F you to being sick right before a job interview.
8293367	8294707	F you to midterms being this week.
8294947	8298908	F you to being too broke to afford a communications book to study for said midterms.
8299108	8305050	First of all, you need to actually look past where you're applying and apply somewhere else.
8307080	8310741	and FU to looking at the wrong page during an oral assignment.
8311561	8315142	Prompting the teacher to ask me if I knew the difference between Niko and Inu.
8315302	8317222	One page had a cat in the picture, the other had a dog.
8317723	8321524	Look lady, teach us to count in Japanese before you call out page numbers in Japanese.
8325464	8329365	Marin would like to say, oh by the way, Marin made a, she made a funny earlier.
8329445	8332346	She said, Siegfried's been mauled by a tiger before.
8332726	8335627	If they stop sleeping with the tigers, they might not get mauled so much.
8338103	8339904	Marin would like to say, here be my F.U.
8339924	8340304	of the week.
8341825	8342045	F.U.
8342085	8344366	to the financial aid office of the local college.
8344466	8348168	Apparently, they didn't distribute any of my financial aid money to any of my classes.
8348549	8356153	So I got a lovely letter in the mail yesterday from the administration office saying that I have to tell the temp to pay for all my classes, otherwise I'll be removed from all of them.
8357273	8360914	Well, if you guys would listen... No, no, no, because I can actually comment on this one.
8360934	8361314	Alright.
8362415	8364776	F you to the financial aid office at the local college.
8365056	8368497	Apparently they didn't distribute any of my financial aid money to any of my classes.
8368857	8375519	So I got a lovely letter in the mail yesterday from the administration office saying that I have until the 10th to pay for all my classes, otherwise I'd be removed from all of them.
8375819	8380101	Speak to the director of financial aid if they won't help you contact the Department of Education and turn their asses in.
8382184	8384066	Straight to Jamie's mouth.
8384086	8384626	She's listening.
8384706	8386108	I work for student loans.
8386928	8388590	You talk to the department.
8389071	8393495	If the school is not going to work with you, if the school does direct lending, contact the Department of Education.
8393575	8396157	If not, find out who your lender is and contact them.
8396858	8397759	They can work with the school.
8399260	8400622	And Maren says, yes, ma'am.
8401002	8401803	Oh, my goodness.
8402782	8403042	Yes.
8404322	8406563	I will tell her that, well, I'll tell you.
8406823	8411585	Tomorrow I will send you an IM with the Department of Education's 800 number.
8413585	8414626	Maren says, yes, ma'am.
8415466	8416206	She's on that.
8416266	8416566	All right.
8417587	8420988	And F you to Rick for not straightening out issues with our old apartment complex.
8421048	8422368	Thanks to him not correcting them.
8422848	8427049	I'm being sued for reg for the last month we were there, even though we weren't there the whole month.
8427189	8427670	End rants.
8427710	8428290	K, thanks.
8428370	8428670	Bye.
8432409	8432850	Moving on.
8434032	8440682	Dork would like to say F you to Counter-Strike for having so many hackers that can rip your freaking head off from the starting point.
8441901	8446023	F you to work for not letting me off early so I can go home and listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
8446544	8450306	I'm here today because I asked for off to go to a friend's birthday.
8451166	8453648	F you to my car because I don't know what the fuck is wrong with it.
8454388	8458871	Now my chances of going to Mobile, Alabama for their tournament is slim.
8459531	8460712	F you to my saving habits.
8461172	8469197	F you to my DDR private attacking because it all... If there's a tournament next month, I'm going to be in Mobile next month.
8471363	8475126	Wow, DarkSakura, you need to cover the Tournament Mobile for us.
8475186	8476608	That's my freaking hometown, I'll do it.
8476628	8477528	You need to research that.
8477909	8479570	Get in contact with Dork.
8479610	8481332	Hey, Dork, email our station.
8481692	8485496	I'm actually in the chat room, even though I'm technically not there because I'm logged in at home.
8485836	8489239	DarkSakura, SSF, that's me, send me a PM with the details.
8489459	8490600	Dork, do that.
8491100	8492161	Okay.
8492201	8494944	Dork would also like to say F you to the Saints for losing again.
8497186	8498127	So what else is new?
8500572	8510122	Tao would like to say F you to my roommates for monopolizing the PS2 with Disgaea and then taking the GTA and my sacred FFTA from me.
8510202	8512604	Which, if I remember, didn't he mooch that from somebody else?
8512924	8514306	I believe so!
8514346	8515968	But anyway, would you like to respond, puppy?
8518123	8518323	No.
8518623	8518903	Okay.
8519223	8521885	You know, I've had this horrible urge to play Parappa 2 lately.
8524926	8525226	All right.
8527967	8531989	In all seriousness, he says, F you to, well, shit, this was a good week for me.
8532149	8533669	F you to not having much to bitch at.
8533689	8536230	That's a good feeling.
8536430	8537031	No silence.
8537091	8538451	Stop parrying in the chat room.
8539252	8540912	Speaking of no silence...
8545929	8566447	Screw people that drive slow, F you for people that wear transparent shoes, F you for not having 40 cent days at McDonald's, F you to Comcast, F you to my car which has been dead for three months, F you to people that play Warcraft 3 all day and have nothing better to do, F you to expensive Goosh paint, I don't know, what the hell is that?
8567128	8568509	Does any artist here know what that is?
8568609	8572032	G-H-O-U-C-E, Goosh, I don't know.
8574349	8574869	I've never heard of it.
8575950	8582333	They come in these small 2.4 ounces and cost $6 to $9, and they get used up after a single project.
8582493	8583653	Good job, Skye and Jamie.
8584194	8584454	On what?
8584494	8584834	I don't know.
8585534	8586175	It says good job.
8586615	8588015	Because we rock.
8591197	8592498	Well, Loki, you just suck.
8592618	8593258	No, I'm just kidding.
8594338	8595159	I don't know.
8595739	8596379	Loki, I don't know.
8596399	8597960	You want to respond to No Silent?
8599341	8599641	All right.
8602819	8608922	Alright, PDR Mike would like to say, F you to the drunk Mexican who showed me his ding-a-ling last week.
8608943	8610443	What?
8613585	8615666	Well, Mike, if you hadn't looked so interested.
8617107	8619609	Just kidding, just kidding.
8619989	8624771	Alright, Dork says that the tournament is on November 1st in Mobile, Alabama.
8624791	8626833	Tell him to private message me his details.
8626853	8630735	Because it's actually probably the day I'm flying in.
8637609	8639410	Um, and there's lots of typing going on.
8640470	8642671	I'm relaying the message as she says, yes ma'am.
8643031	8650734	Alright, no, but, um, if it's on the first then I likely can't attend because it's the day I'm planning on flying in unless I can fly in the day before.
8651634	8652434	So just give me details.
8654355	8660337	I need details, times, locations, is it at, you know, cyber station or what, let me know.
8660817	8662298	Alright, that's it for the FQs of the week.
8663658	8664139	Finally.
8664159	8664699	Yay!
8666284	8668765	Oh, oh, Aaron, Aaron would like to say something to you all?
8670086	8676808	Uh, Baka, um, I know you like PETA, but stop advertising it in the chat for the goddamn last time.
8677248	8678109	How many times do I have to say this?
8678149	8679229	PETA is dead!
8680189	8680770	Jeez.
8681830	8682690	Until I bring it back.
8684011	8688352	No styling says, DJ, that's good job, for Loki.
8688973	8690353	Don't know who he or she is.
8696101	8697922	I'll tell you here.
8698262	8700683	NoSilent says, um, GJ for Loki.
8701023	8702223	Don't know who he or she is.
8704024	8704624	Good job.
8704664	8705024	Good job.
8705924	8707005	Don't know who he or she is.
8709305	8709746	It's alright.
8710466	8710886	I don't care.
8712046	8714467	I wasn't even paying attention.
8715047	8715968	He's kind of shaking a little bit.
8715988	8716368	It's alright.
8716588	8716968	I don't care.
8718128	8718469	I don't care.
8718489	8719009	I'm going to kill him.
8719029	8719569	I don't care.
8721940	8723461	See those squirrels outside?
8723861	8725762	Yeah, my attack squirrels.
8726183	8726703	Yeah.
8730525	8731506	We know where you live!
8732046	8740792	You do realize by tuning into the station they send you, you know, send us your address, so... Home address, you dumb shit!
8750993	8752154	Quiet, quiet.
8752274	8753654	Go back to your chemistry homework.
8759356	8760356	Chemists suck.
8760836	8761797	Be a drug dealer.
8765658	8768159	That's like street chemistry for you.
8772180	8773521	And it pays better anyways.
8775981	8777542	You know, Canada is so cool.
8780808	8782069	We should take a road trip there.
8783850	8789194	It's like, I don't know, it's like we're like the 60s and Canada is the 70s.
8791095	8792596	Or what, wait, did the 70s suck?
8793456	8794397	The 70s had disco.
8795138	8796478	And remember, your disco needs you.
8801942	8804183	Oh, I remember now why Canada rocks.
8804564	8807586	Because they're going to start selling alcohol in movie theaters.
8808587	8809247	I'm going.
8810167	8810847	I am going.
8811107	8811948	Drunk moviegoers.
8812768	8813608	That's awesome.
8813628	8816568	Drunk moviegoers need to buy more popcorn so they can drink more.
8818909	8823150	Oh, and FU did my work giving me Geely, which is sitting on top of my PS2 right there.
8824170	8824510	Evil.
8826790	8828691	Hey, Zodiac Knight wants to share something with you.
8828971	8831571	They actually made cocaine in his organic lab.
8831951	8833912	Don't you wish you went to his school, puppy?
8834452	8834872	Really?
8835192	8835372	Yep.
8836522	8838063	What a cool... I wouldn't make in cocaine.
8838383	8838844	Why not?
8838924	8840585	It's fun and educational.
8842486	8842766	Alright.
8843727	8844768	We're going to take a quick break.
8844788	8848570	We're going to play two songs from the V-Rare 2 CD US.
8848991	8855275	We're going to play Tomorrow Perfume and I Need You, and then I'm throwing in... Oh, we'll do that.
8855375	8856436	Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
8856756	8858437	So we'll do those second and third.
8858878	8864882	But in the meantime, if you guys enjoyed tonight's cage match winner, P8107, you might enjoy... Loki, tell them about it.
8866776	8887557	and K8107, like I said, I don't even know what this 8107 shit is, but K8107 is a remix of Karma, so, uh, it's pretty cool, but anyway, it's also by Onuken, um, you can actually find it on his site if you search for Onuken under, um, muzy.co.jp, you can find him on there,
8889209	8889229	K8107
9191753	9193295	Thank you for watching!
9243785	9261629	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because Bongo demands it Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio
9271394	9272395	God, I hate that ferret.
9272415	9273175	I hate it so much.
9273196	9276558	I thought you guys would go one week without bringing the damn thing out, and there it is.
9277199	9277619	Jeez.
9278600	9280562	Alright, shut the fuck up for a minute.
9280602	9282803	I have some news I want to talk about here.
9283264	9284985	Do not make me confiscate that.
9285306	9286266	I will confiscate it.
9287207	9288128	I will confiscate it.
9289249	9291110	Run, puppy, run like the wind.
9291210	9292672	I will confiscate it.
9293953	9295634	It's even worse than confiscating.
9296975	9298417	Alright, this is interesting.
9298557	9302522	I was talking and I don't remember if you were there talking with us too, Jamie.
9303243	9307948	Mel B was talking to us yesterday while we were at Miggle about some things.
9308008	9310251	And he works at Konami now and he was telling us a lot of interesting things.
9310271	9313615	I don't know, I'm not going to repeat any of it because I don't know what can and can't be repeated.
9313675	9316739	Nothing, nothing, nothing to, it's nothing...
9318134	9320276	There's nothing earth shattering anyway.
9320357	9322779	There's nothing, so I'm not even going to go there.
9323160	9324762	Just that I will say this.
9325522	9329407	He says Ultra Mix looks very cool, which I'm sure it already does.
9329467	9330168	I could have told you that.
9330408	9331529	So we'll see about that.
9331830	9337736	But one thing I was trying to tell him, I'd asked him if he knew anything about Sony putting out a new competitive dancing game.
9338277	9344540	Sony has released the full track listing featured in the upcoming dancing game for their iToy Peripheral.
9344560	9345621	Sony Computer Entertainment Europe...
9364469	9370734	is pleased to announce the 25 fully licensed music tracks that will feature in the brand new dancing game, iToy Groove.
9371534	9383123	Released in November 2003, iToy Groove utilizes the PlayStation 2's exclusive iToy technology and gives everyone a chance to fulfill their dreams of being able to dance live on TV.
9384064	9393631	By linking the iToy USB camera to a PlayStation 2, the players will feature live on their TV screen, enabling them to dance along with the on-screen prompts.
9395017	9398519	The full list of artists and tracks to groove along to is as follows.
9398559	9398839	Here it is.
9398859	9399539	I'll read this for you.
9400059	9401200	Madonna with music.
9402080	9403561	Hey, Mr. DJ.
9404341	9405922	Kool and the Gang with Jungle Boogie.
9406742	9408483	The Superman Lovers with Starlight.
9408583	9410704	Earth, Wind, and Fire with Let's Groove.
9414326	9416347	Sister Sledge with We Are Family.
9417527	9419268	Jamiroquai, Deeper Underground.
9419628	9421049	Jamiroquai, Canned Heat.
9421509	9423150	Last Ketchup with the Ketchup Song.
9424116	9438786	Top Loader with Dancing in the Moonlight, Five with Keep on Moving, Sugar Babes with Overload, Junior Senior, Move Your Feet, Village People, YMCA, Apollo 440, Hustlers Groove, The Jacksons, ABC,
9440899	9469683	Mystique with All I Want, Daniel Bedingfield, Gotta Get Through This, The Commodores with Machine Gun, Groove Armada with Super Stylin', Livin' Joy with Don't Stop Movin', The Cheeky Girls with Hooray Hooray It's a Cheeky Holiday, Pure Tones with Addicted to Bass, Liberty X with Jumpin', Elvis with Rubberneckin', Fatboy Slim with Praise You, and Elvis with A Little Less Conversation.
9471070	9477116	With no complicated controls, iToy Groove is instantly accessible, even for those with no rhythm.
9477176	9479718	So come on everybody, let's get down and groove.
9480479	9481060	What do you guys think?
9484102	9487566	Gee, I like motion capture dance games, because they rock.
9488847	9493832	iToy is retarded, and if you think people look awkward playing DDR, wait until you see this.
9495333	9496134	This is nothing.
9497836	9504682	I'm thinking, if it's some kind of camera that's capturing your motion, I'm thinking this sounds a lot like Para to me.
9505303	9506944	Is it just me or does this sound like Para?
9507665	9509207	The reincarnation of Para.
9510187	9511689	It sounds like Marshall Beat.
9512830	9513971	Hmm, Marshall Beat.
9515132	9516053	So somewhere in there.
9517234	9519976	Are you coming here to reiterate that Para is dead?
9519997	9521158	Because we already know, Erin.
9521178	9523099	This is where I pray that this one will die too.
9525185	9527306	Please, please, please die!
9528306	9530167	So Baka doesn't have another thing to rave that guy about.
9530187	9533428	The problem with games like this is they're not going to have their own in-house music.
9533848	9540311	So it's based off of these 25 songs, which will get old about as fast as DDR Max 2 got old.
9541731	9546953	So, um, you know what, this will be, like, good for those people who are like, Oh!
9548114	9550115	Oh my god, it's Madonna!
9550395	9552195	Oh my god, I get this game!
9552295	9552916	Sign me up!
9552956	9553436	That's me!
9555743	9557504	Sign me up, I'm going out and buying this thing.
9557564	9558845	I want to dance to music.
9559085	9561687	Hey, Mr. DJ.
9562648	9567031	The iToy, I mean, while a cool idea, it's just, um, no.
9567751	9567932	No.
9569172	9569893	It's just retarded.
9570313	9574976	I mean, it's like, there's no, like, Loki's right, there's no in-house music.
9575417	9579680	If they have Police 911 working with the iToy, then I'll purchase one of those, but that's it.
9581811	9584013	Zodiac Knight would like to reiterate in our chat room.
9584033	9596138	He says, and then a secret chip inside the PS2 records images of you dancing and sends them to Sony headquarters where executives sit in a large room, watch the images, and laugh at you.
9599040	9599580	Sounds good to me.
9599600	9600560	Kick Andrew again!
9600600	9601461	Kick Andrew again!
9601481	9603041	Why do I get to kick Andrew again?
9603522	9606043	I'm sorry, that directive was not coming from Jamie.
9606103	9608164	I can't do it in... Okay, Jamie said to kick him.
9613680	9625110	Oh, and to respond to AZ and Buddy Paul, it's because all the idiots that started Para decided to start drama over it, and if it comes up again, it's even more drama, and the little idiot's going, Oh no, you didn't do the routine right!
9625270	9626311	That person knew!
9627972	9629193	That's why it needs to die!
9632756	9633097	Alright.
9634938	9636500	As promised in this part of the show...
9637600	9647930	We'd like to take a minute to let you take some control over the show and have us talk about any topic you want us to in a segment that we call Ask Orange Lounge.
9648230	9651954	And you can send those questions now over private message to Sky in the chat room.
9652274	9653875	In the meantime, let's hear the theme song.
9659821	9661062	Let's Ask Orange Lounge.
9661623	9662684	Some stupid question.
9663490	9666613	What will we learn tonight on Ask Orange Lounge?
9667174	9668495	What is Loki mad about?
9668996	9670417	What is DarkSakura mad about?
9670857	9672499	What is Sky mad about?
9672659	9673980	The answer is probably Aaron.
9675542	9676143	Just kidding.
9677864	9678145	Alright.
9683910	9687274	Question number one is coming to us tonight from Baka.
9688854	9689915	And this is a good question.
9689955	9692576	This is my favorite question that's ever been asked in Ask Orange Lounge.
9693176	9696078	He says, Baka says, why are you so cool, Sky?
9706043	9709025	Let's go over this long list of reasons that I have.
9711727	9713348	My response is another question.
9713788	9715528	How many jokes have you been taking tonight?
9716109	9716829	Just as cool.
9717529	9718450	Now, now, now.
9718510	9719490	Ryan, there's no comment.
9719530	9721311	It'd take more than that to get a piece of the cock.
9727333	9736656	I would like to say... Because, face it, everybody... I mean, we're in the 21st century now, and everybody loves the token gay guy, right?
9738457	9740678	And not only that, but I'm a token gay guy on the radio.
9741837	9753659	I'm the token black guy, so... Loki consistently bringing this show to new lows.
9754420	9757320	Well, I don't know if you listen to half the people online who've never met me in person.
9757360	9758480	I'm the token Asian girl.
9760421	9766842	When the fact is that between Loki, DarkSakura, and myself, we are like the whitest people ever.
9769043	9769563	I don't know, I'm...
9772366	9775367	Who wants to respond to Zodiac Night's comment, yay for token Asians?
9775487	9778147	I like everybody for dinner For a hundred people
9804739	9805079	All right.
9807001	9810384	Question number two tonight comes from AZN Buddy Paul.
9811224	9812866	I already sent this in email.
9813086	9815868	Oh, I didn't even open the Orange Lodge mailbag.
9815888	9816549	I may have to do that.
9816889	9818630	There's never anything in the Orange Lodge mailbag.
9819531	9819972	But here it is.
9820632	9826397	AZN Buddy Paul would like to know why Sunday night for this show I'm breaking rules staying up this late.
9827157	9827418	Well...
9828311	9831533	When Orange Lounge Radio started, I was doing double work.
9831593	9841060	I was doing another show on Saturday night under Station Live, which is still on the air because the host moved to Texas and has some new co-hosts now under StationLive.org.
9841100	9848305	That's on Saturday night, so it just kind of made sense to do a show on Sunday night, and that's what Jamie agreed to, and that's what Matt started showing up to.
9850627	9852628	But there's always the rewinds.
9852648	9852748	Yes.
9853409	9853869	Thank you.
9853929	9856130	There's always the rewinds on...
9858324	9858824	What nights?
9860685	9861406	We keep switching them.
9861446	9863627	Thursdays at 2 and Wednesdays at 4.
9864307	9865248	Pacific Standard Time.
9865368	9867169	No more Mondays because that's when Vanilla Sky is on.
9869110	9878634	The reason why, also, I learned from doing a radio show on Saturday night, although there may be a lot of people at home who want to listen, that ruins my Saturday night.
9878754	9882836	I can't go out and go to places like Dave and Buster's and all that stuff if you're doing a show on a Saturday.
9882936	9884097	And my wife comes first.
9885612	9887933	As I believe Jamie and Loki would agree to.
9887993	9888953	Oh, you have to answer 23rd Maggie.
9888973	9890013	She said, I am the wise person ever.
9891753	9892594	Uh, yeah, yeah, he's right.
9893174	9894174	Um, yeah, he is right.
9894214	9895014	He is the wise person ever.
9895534	9900395	Um, but, um, it is Friday, Saturday night.
9900455	9903176	While they might be good for ratings, it just, we want to have a life.
9903296	9906537	And if we don't go out there and get a life, we'll have nothing to talk about on this program.
9906577	9907197	So, deal.
9908444	9912265	Sorry, but yes, if you don't like Sunday nights, you can't always listen to the rewinds.
9912385	9917907	And there's also original programming on Monday and Tuesday, and soon Wednesday again nights as well, so.
9918487	9918707	Yeah.
9920267	9921047	But thanks for asking.
9925409	9929510	Alright, 23rd Magus would like to ask, pink, purple, or teal?
9931690	9932390	What's the question?
9932410	9933071	I mean, why?
9933091	9934431	Pink, purple, or teal?
9934711	9935471	That's the question.
9935531	9935871	Purple.
9937372	9937452	Um...
9938772	9939793	Let me see if I can guess.
9940133	9943215	What color should he dye his pubes?
9947157	9953381	I will go with purple because that might offset your hair or something.
9955243	9955963	You're horrible.
9957224	9959925	It would also confuse people looking for a natural color.
9961787	9964108	We already have a pink, so maybe teal.
9964148	9965269	You can be the artist known as teal.
9967463	9979391	Alright, um, 23rd Magus would also like to ask, 23rd Magus would like to ask, why do we have a gazillion ops in the chat room, but very few are on consistently?
9979771	9981452	My answer to that is, quit op begging.
9982973	9990678	You know, I think it has to do just because we cycle in and out, we're all on at different times, except for Puppy, who has no life.
9991379	9991459	Uh,
9992779	9995802	Angel's on almost all the time at some obscene hours of the day.
9995842	9996863	DT's on there a lot.
9997263	9997703	I don't know.
9997743	10000946	We might make new ops later, but we'll think about it.
10001867	10002087	Yeah.
10002368	10007652	When you get more people in the chatroom, and I mean you, not specifically at the question house, but you as in our chatroom.
10007672	10007992	Our listeners.
10008113	10011696	When you, the listener, get more people in the chatroom consistently, then we'll make new ops.
10012176	10012857	How's that sound?
10014038	10016560	And plus, you guys are just so good and don't cause trouble.
10016800	10017981	You know, we don't need a lot of ops.
10018322	10018742	So, yeah.
10020925	10022886	Who needs a big at sign anyway?
10022966	10024367	It's just a pain in the ass.
10026249	10027329	It validates who I am.
10027810	10029411	Dork has a question for Jamie.
10029771	10030071	What?
10030712	10032993	When are you going to be in Mobile?
10033073	10035855	If I can get the time off of work, it's going to be the 1st through the 15th.
10038177	10038517	Fair enough.
10040140	10044321	Next question, Greg Ismasa would like to know, what's for dinner?
10045081	10047081	I wonder if he's asking what we had for dinner tonight.
10047121	10048401	How about Chef Aaron explain?
10048461	10052922	He's asking me, because he's treated me out before for food, so I kind of owe him dinner.
10054402	10054503	Oh.
10054563	10055363	Mystery meat.
10056443	10058063	Well, answer the question I asked.
10058143	10059363	What did we have tonight?
10059403	10060083	Tell that to our show.
10060103	10066865	We had shredded, or well, chopped up cabbage into strips with pork, and in Jamie's case, chicken, because she can't eat pork.
10067125	10067685	And we had rice.
10068185	10068805	Always a staple.
10073203	10073483	Yummy.
10074124	10074524	Very good.
10075425	10078448	Puppy, do you have your hand up or are you just dangling the ferret by its balls?
10080429	10087796	The ferrets are joined like, for people who live in the south, you'll recognize these, like the little love bugs.
10088637	10089998	You say, oh, well they're joined.
10090058	10090719	That's so pretty.
10090779	10091499	They're fucking.
10092300	10094342	It's like cat talk, but it's ferret, ferret.
10097139	10103984	Seriously, the thing is that if you catch the two bugs together and make a wish about the person you love and let them go, then it's happy.
10104024	10109128	But all that you do is you catch them and damage their wings and then they die while they're fucking.
10112971	10114172	Alright, moving on.
10114652	10119916	For Greg, mystery meat does not actually include regular cattle meat.
10119996	10122798	It could include other meat, cough, cough, human meat, cough, cough.
10125726	10126927	Alright, moving on.
10127047	10129728	EvilNauki... Are you okay?
10131169	10132030	Boys, what are you doing?
10132270	10133351	The ferrets turned lethal.
10133771	10134011	Alright.
10135612	10138193	Next question comes to us from EvilNauki2DX.
10139674	10146178	EvilNauki2DX would like to know, okay, why do people start drama over games like Initial D?
10146258	10146858	What the fuck?
10146898	10149200	Because people have no lives and have nothing else to do.
10150526	10156887	Because people at certain arcades, cough, cough, just think it's fun and because they have, yeah, they have no lives.
10157028	10160848	And so they think in order to have a life, you can start drama over other people's lives.
10160868	10162689	So everybody has a life and everybody has drama.
10163029	10163409	The end.
10163689	10164929	Why do people watch soap operas?
10165029	10169070	I think that these are people who use video games to validate their sense of self-worth.
10169650	10170171	Here is my...
10172236	10175378	Here's my answer, my 100% serious answer to this question.
10176119	10180562	Any group that you do participate in is going to have drama.
10180843	10186527	You hear about theater drama, or football drama, or whatever you're doing, there's drama.
10186747	10193232	Because when you get people together, they've got personality clashes up the ass going on, and there's drama.
10193452	10194173	So it doesn't matter.
10194333	10198156	An issue D has drama just as bad as DDR, or any game.
10200834	10203316	Greg, that's funny that you get your ass kicked by cats.
10205237	10205978	Alright, moving on.
10207799	10208379	Jonas, sorry.
10210561	10212442	Stupid people exist, so what to expect?
10213443	10215224	Fair enough.
10215324	10222089	Even though I'll be 2DX, I'd also like to know, may I call you, this will be a question towards me, may I call you Robby Punz from now on?
10223029	10224470	Or Robby Pums.
10224550	10225151	No, you may not.
10225551	10227072	But you may call me Sexy Rob.
10227292	10228273	That is permissible.
10229835	10230795	or the Pharaoh King, yes.
10233656	10240698	Why is it, another question from EvilNaukiTDX, why is it that PT Cruisers follow me around whenever I am outdoors?
10241598	10244859	I don't know, are you just attracting things that suck lately?
10244939	10246060	They want to tap your ass.
10249801	10254242	23rd Magus would like to say, he'd like to clarify the pink, purple and teal question.
10254862	10257063	That was the M&M's poll, you dumbass.
10258348	10262471	I would also like to say the M&M's poll ended about six months ago, you dumbass.
10267375	10270817	Is that like a little anecdote in his five-page joke book?
10271198	10271798	I believe so.
10271858	10272439	It's the foreword.
10272479	10273099	It's the epilogue.
10273820	10274740	It's the fifth page.
10276261	10279083	Dork would like to say, tournament will be all day.
10279144	10280424	Just come whenever you come in.
10280445	10282826	Chances are we'll still be there the November 1st thing.
10282926	10284387	Tell them you may have a special guest then.
10284848	10285028	All right.
10288746	10290327	Zodiac Knight has a question.
10292209	10290327	1.
10292289	10293990	DarkSakura, will you marry me?
10295331	10298773	You'd have to go against Dan, and Dan is 6'4".
10298853	10300875	I think that if he stepped on you, you'd be dead.
10301195	10301555	So, no.
10303496	10307159	Yeah, and Tac's my other man, and then there's my mistress, Margaret Cho.
10308060	10308400	Okay.
10309221	10311102	Well, he had a backup plan here.
10311142	10313123	He says, if not, question 2.
10313243	10314384	Sky, will you marry me?
10316646	10316886	Are you 18?
10320816	10323458	Because I hate it when 17 year olds ask me this question, I hate it.
10326961	10329643	23rd Magus, what the fuck are you fucking doing?
10329683	10330784	Robby Pums!
10330964	10333606	23rd Magus would like to know, can we call you Boo Boo Kitty Fuck?
10335067	10336068	No, and be original.
10341111	10341512	Richie?
10343373	10344594	You may not call me Robby Pums.
10344734	10346035	Then you can call him Richie Poo.
10346195	10349118	Yeah, I can call you, I can call you Boo Boo Kitty Fuck, Richie Poo.
10354296	10356517	I could, but I love him too much to kick him.
10357938	10359660	EvilNauki2DX has a question for DarkSakura.
10359680	10361621	Why don't you kick 23rd Magus instead?
10361861	10363683	Alright, I'll kick... You know what?
10363823	10364223	That's right.
10364263	10367846	What I will do, I will kick 23rd Magus instead of kicking EvilNauki2DX.
10379209	10379969	Yeah, that was easy.
10382430	10382730	Alright.
10388851	10389731	That was beautiful.
10390052	10390372	Alright.
10390532	10391172	Do it again.
10391492	10392212	I want a rerun.
10392612	10393312	You want a rerun?
10393552	10393892	Yeah.
10396113	10397093	Let's syndicate this.
10398474	10400374	It's the kicking 23rd Megas the show.
10403535	10403975	Alright.
10404055	10405275	Alright, that's enough abuse.
10405815	10406195	Okay.
10407236	10408816	No more abusing the freshman, you guys.
10410779	10411660	Fresh Meat.
10412020	10412901	Anyway, next question.
10413682	10414563	I think we're out of questions.
10415004	10415585	Ask us questions.
10415605	10416065	Oh, no, wait.
10416085	10416646	Here it is.
10417026	10419189	EvilNalgy2DX has a question for DarkSakura.
10419349	10419809	Yes.
10419990	10421551	When are you coming to San Francisco again?
10422472	10426757	You know, when someone pays for me to go to San Francisco.
10428318	10428899	I don't know.
10429039	10437645	I actually want to go on a Saturday, but Dan and I are completely redoing our apartment, throwing out crap and stuff.
10438205	10452014	But maybe when I get back from Alabama, I might set out a special Saturday if I'm not sick from all the uber-thick cigarette smoke.
10452435	10454316	Yes, 23rd Magus, you are a target.
10454376	10457058	You know, big, bright red bullseye painted on your ass.
10458530	10461193	Big white target with the bright red bull's eye painted on the ground.
10461213	10461994	And this is so white.
10462835	10466220	Oh, so that means that I can go to him to buy my deodorant.
10466720	10467161	Alright.
10469941	10471322	Nevermind, I'll go to Walmart.
10471342	10474163	23rd Magus says, will you have extra medical supplies tomorrow?
10474203	10474763	You'll need them.
10475063	10476563	He's directing that towards me because he's coming.
10476823	10484926	He wants to guest on Vanilla Sky tomorrow because he believes that he can play video game trivia to bad music and keep the volume at 5%.
10486087	10491749	He's challenging me to own him at a video game trivia to bad music.
10491829	10492549	So we shall see.
10495598	10501620	I don't know, Brad kept it at only 15% last week while Rice Princess went to 65% You know I don't like that Huh?
10501740	10507082	You know I don't at it Well, why don't you put your money where your mouth is?
10507182	10523127	Because I have to freaking wash the sheets on my bed tomorrow You know, you can come clean up my bedroom if you want to I don't really want to Okay then My sheets smell like Shermie's butt right now because she slept on my bed
10525629	10530674	Okay, so I think now's a good time for us to close up the old mailbag for Ask Orange Law.
10530714	10532896	Oh wait, actually I should check the email bag real fast.
10533857	10539322	In the meantime, will Jamie please entertain us with a song and dance while I open up the mailbag?
10543065	10544947	I'm never asking her to do this again.
10552347	10560232	And that was the horrendous sexual acts of two stuffed ferrets with a little voice box inside of them.
10561854	10568058	The email box is orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com, all one word, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.
10569079	10573542	We just got that same question from Paul that says, why are the shows on Sunday?
10574102	10576924	Sunday night, people have to get ready to go back to school or work.
10576944	10579626	Did we get any questions asking if we wanted enlarged penises?
10581211	10582071	In the mailbox, no.
10583052	10584972	Damn it, I've always wanted a larger penis!
10596516	10599057	For those people who didn't see it before, there's the pad.
10599557	10600478	Number one finished.
10600818	10600938	Ah!
10601518	10602218	Webcam slipping.
10603419	10603839	There it is.
10604239	10604839	No, it's not bent.
10604879	10605740	It's just a camera lens.
10609281	10609721	Ain't it pretty?
10611864	10612845	It's very nice.
10613305	10617487	Although I'm still amazed by how many things are built out of wood out here.
10634150	10635391	Who was the biggest bitch?
10635971	10637112	Send your votes right now.
10637813	10639514	Just kidding, just kidding.
10639614	10640815	If you vote, you'll get kicked.
10641035	10641275	Alright.
10642656	10644057	Alright.
10645799	10646019	Yes.
10651383	10655045	Okay, so it's about time to wrap up the show, you guys.
10655686	10656947	Wrap it up in ribbons and bows.
10656987	10657948	Wrap it up in ribbons and bows.
10657968	10659589	Wrap it up in straps and buckles.
10661570	10662151	Before...
10663931	10666652	We put the lid on the coffin of the show.
10666672	10668653	We have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10668713	10669753	So let's start off with Aaron.
10670654	10671414	Violent Hyper Girl.
10674195	10674936	Drama sucks.
10675396	10677917	Para is not meant for a community.
10678117	10678557	The end.
10682719	10684760	Jonas, final thought.
10685180	10687561	Well, I forgot to mention this before.
10687721	10689361	I was thinking about running a tournament in January.
10689842	10690542	Booked for January.
10691986	10697894	So if anyone wants to contact me about this tournament, just go to drfreak.com on the Visionaries Forum.
10699056	10707428	Oh fuck, just go to AIM or just email me, that's all.
10708143	10709664	or go to that site you hoarded out earlier.
10710045	10715309	Well, I'm online like 24-7, so I-M-E at sillyfobbygirl, G-U-R-L.
10716029	10721554	Fobby is F-O-B-B-Y, and then I'll just forward it to Jonas, because occasionally you're online, right?
10721954	10722134	Yeah.
10722614	10724576	Yeah, occasionally he's online, so, yeah.
10730661	10730881	Yeah.
10734531	10735831	Bradley, your final thought, please.
10736291	10738493	I so hope I get a job soon, soon.
10739593	10740854	The Doom is closing in.
10743235	10744196	Puppy, your final thought?
10744856	10746137	Chemistry sucks at the end.
10747197	10747998	Alright, well put.
10749959	10751099	Who hasn't gone yet?
10751199	10752520	Just the three of us?
10752900	10753241	Loki!
10756162	10759464	Remember, for all you trainables out there, it's the middle hole.
10764283	10766685	My final thought is stay tuned for the afterbirth tonight.
10766725	10767365	It's going to be great.
10769366	10775449	My final thought is I need some money and I need a maid to clean my house for me.
10776710	10777370	I need a house.
10777990	10778511	A big one.
10778971	10779771	I need a compound.
10779831	10780752	I want a castle.
10782893	10783533	With a moat.
10784614	10786335	We need to have our own gated community.
10786415	10787135	I like that idea.
10787155	10788456	The Orange Lounge gated community.
10789696	10793677	Oh yeah, that link posted is wrong, because Jonas screwed up.
10794537	10796738	My bad, my bad.
10796938	10799039	It's G-A-M-E, not N-E.
10801880	10804520	Alright, thank you.
10804760	10810122	Final word of the show tonight will go to... Whoa, I don't think Puppy's ever had it, so let's give it to Puppy.
10811102	10811943	Nomenclature.
10814463	10815604	I don't have the outro queued up.
10818636	10820878	Thank you for listening and supporting Orange Lounge Radio Puppy, nomenclature
10836465	10838870	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10839311	10843218	Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
10843599	10845462	We expect you a nice play again.
10845943	10848728	And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
10850347	10855131	Well, here I am in my tubby again, and my tubby's all filled with water and nice fluffy suds.
10855571	10858133	And I've got my soap and washcloth to wash myself.
10858614	10861576	And I've got my nifty scrub brush to help me scrub my back.
10862177	10865179	And I've got a big fluffy towel to dry myself when I'm done.
10865760	10869583	But there's one other thing that makes tubby time the very best time of the whole day.
