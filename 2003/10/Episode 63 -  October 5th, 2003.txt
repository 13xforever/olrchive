Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk and then some.
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
Yes, I will spank your child. If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.
Well, here's to my big opening.
A sphincter says what?
I'm super. Thanks for asking.
Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.
What am I doing here?
No.
Dodge this.
Mm-hmm. This is a tasty burger.
Look, you stupid bastard. You've got no arms left.
Yes, I have. Look.
There's a flesh wound.
Searching for a boy in high school is useless.
It's searching for meaning in a polyshore movie.
Oh, yeah? Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.
Dark Sakura.
Sakura, I had a sniff sky, but I'm playing it for the bartender. So suffer Loki. I hate you

Howdy everybody, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. Here we are at the start of episode number 63.
Whoop-de-doo.
What an exciting week. Not quite the as exciting of a week as last week when we had Max 2 was out and new and all that other fun stuff.
stuff. Although, Jamie is here and she brought with her, she brought the U.S. versions of
V-Rare 1 and V-Rare 2. That you have to get at Fry's, correct?
V-Rare 1 you got at Toys R Us actually with DDR Max and V-Rare 2 you have to get at Fry's,
which is pissing a lot of East Coast people off.
Because there's no Fry's out there? Because there's no Fry's out there.
Suck with them. Well, I know Fry's 1 runs a website at Outpost.com,
right? That was the only place you were able to get.
You remember when Dance Dance Revolution for the PC came out? You could only get it at Fry's, it was a Fry's exclusive.
But you could order some Outpost.com.
I know, but humor me for a second here.
So theoretically, shouldn't you be able to get those samplers at Outpost.com?
I don't know, and I really don't care, because I already have the...
I already have that too, and I could just get the VR online somewhere.
I would think so, but...
Well I know, but for a collector, and if you're a hardcore collector on the East Coast, this is going to piss you off that you can't get it.
Over there.
and I am not a collector, sir.
I hate the stinky old man at my apartment complex.
Well I think now might be a good time to get into our favorite game we like to play here
at Orange Lounge Radio.
How was your day and how was your week?
So I think, Jamie, it would be most appropriate if you would start us off tonight.
Well, starting with the week, the week was pretty good, you know, nothing really horrible
happened.
Got to have somewhat of a date with Dan, which we hardly ever get to spend time together.
It was pretty good.
Last night was great.
I drank how much last night?
A lot.
Not as much as I usually do when I go drinking, but it was pretty good and I was very happy
and spent most of the evening with a pleasant buzz.
What did we do?
Oh yeah, it was Chub's birthday.
Yes, Chub's birthday party was his birthday.
And that was really lots of fun, and happy birthday to Chubbs, being 21 now.
Played some Bump It Up while someone intoxicated.
Played lots of that crappy wannabe pachinko machine, and I have this blue spotted dog
and a cup that says Dave and Buster's on it.
Today, though, I'm, you know, in bed sleeping because I was up till 5.30 in the morning
and I hear, if you don't get up and help me clean this house, you're not going to go to
your show.
So I get up and go, excuse me, and then clean the house.
So I spent practically all of my day cleaning the house, then had a nice shower, got ready.
I stayed at home long enough to turn on the show and went to the grocery store and then
I was in every bit of bad traffic I could possibly imagine, short of there being a wreck.
Because, you know, I wouldn't be here right now had there been a wreck because I would
still be behind all these people, stopping and staring at the rack. Wow. Oh my god, I
see a bloody stump! That's an arm. Ooh, yay. You know, if you want to see bloody stumps,
just go rent a horror movie or something. Rent faces a death. I was talking about if
there had been an accident, people would be stopping and going, oh, can I see a bloody
stumped so at any rate that's why I was late you know stupid people and and now
I'm doing laundry oh yeah I had another thing happen during the week but it's
really retarded I never mind I'm not gonna talk about that cuz I figured as
I played some PSO, my game froze in the middle of playing PSO so I lost the two levels I
gained and all of my items that weren't equipped including my meteor cudgel which pissed me
off but I'm getting them all back and that's really about it.
Buy stuff from my vendor in Ragnarok, thank you.
All right, let's move on. Puppy, how was your day and how was your week?
Let's see, today I'm kind of pissy because I've had too much chemistry work to do. I've
spent all day writing up lab reports and writing up freaking chemistry things. I had to bring
my chemistry book with me so I could work on it before the show started. And then I
had a little adventure at lunch. I wanted to go get food before leaving to come to the
show, so I go down the street to Carl's Jr.'s, I look inside, there's like fifteen people
in line to order, and like one person working behind the counter. So I'm like, screw this.
I go over to the subway nearby. They don't take ATM cards. I go down to the two grocery
stores in the same plaza, and either of them have working ATMs. I drive halfway across
to a liquor store that has an ATM, it's not working. I drive back downtown to go get food,
and then when I finally get back with it, it's not the right thing. I ate it anyways
because I was hungry and hadn't eaten anything in almost 24 hours. So yeah, that made me
kind of pissy. And then the whole stupid driver thing, that's for everybody that drives,
except for the stupid drivers themselves.
Bradley, how was your day and how was your week?
All right.
Beginning of this week I went to a temp agency and then they sent me to an interview for
data entry position the next day.
I did okay on that, but of course as I go on I think of many different ways that I screwed
it up.
It was like my first real job interview, talking to an actual person in front of them.
The only other job interview I've ever done was over the phone for an intern thing five
years ago. Of course, I was supposedly supposed to find out at the end of Tuesday if he decided
yes or no. I call in and the person in the agency is supposed to call me back, but she
never does. I was waiting until the next morning and I call in and what did he decide? He's
looking at more looking at the resumes and everything so we have to wait a bit
longer and then so wait the Thursday Friday and he hasn't decided by Friday
yet so I guess I find out next week sometime so I doubt it I'll get it
because I didn't do all that great you know what though I've been I've been in
a very similar position in job hunting where you're going to like 10 pages to
10 base your staffing industry whatever it is and I swear to God those people
are never really with it like they never are able to meet their deadlines or
whatever you're just strung along like a stupid puppet and then finally just out
of the blue one day it'll hit so we'll all cross our fingers for you yeah so
well have to go look at stuff next week that's the future maybe try to fake my
way to knowing medical terminology but since I know a little bit I may be able
kostjamrh How was your day and week?
it
we have this journal and you're supposed to write
beginning and endings just anything about it
so my topic now is
beginning of work with fifty seven and the end of my life
but but but
which is how bad it is interesting
i've written on my friends uh... legal pad kill me now please just kill me now
during English class
and other than that
cutting back on initial D slowly
good for you
I'm just messing with you
uh... let's see
kind of studying
extra emphasis on kind of
going out meeting lots of people
other than that's been a pretty okay week
except my mom's always over emotional every time she comes here
It's getting kind of irritating.
It's like, gee, mom, I'm not going
to die while I'm in Davis, OK?
But I miss my baby.
You know, it's kind of funny.
I actually saw she didn't like having me around the house.
And then all of a sudden, they move away.
Now she's like, oh, my god.
They can't wait to get rid of you until they do,
and then they miss you like hell.
Yep.
So yeah, it's been a pretty good week.
I'm eating these blue chips so I'm having a hard time talking right now.
Next we'll go to Loki and see how his day and his week was but first I want to say hello
to some new chatters we have in our chat room tonight because we have a lot of new people
in the chat room tonight.
Are they listening?
Are they listening?
They better be listening because we know.
We know and we will find out and you will pay if you're not.
click on orange lounge and click on chat if you want to join in, just like these new people
I don't recognize have been here before. Greg is Masa, hello. Zodiac Knight, hello.
Sen, hello. And XT Senai. Oh, they're the same person. Well, she got said hello to twice.
the same person well she got said hello to twice what a lucky lucky girl hello to everybody
okay Loki how was your day how was your week i didn't do anything today except they started
wiring my second pads um and those are almost done probably done this week and i was playing
on the one that is done and it was pretty cool until the ground wire fell off then that didn't
work too well so I had to re-solder that and I didn't do that much I worked a
little bit last night up until about 5 in the morning and did some stuff
because I rebooted my computer you dumbass and it automatically kicks on
right away anyways and then that's about it people were gone from my work so I
So I had it pretty easy the last two days. I just ate sandwiches and read the internet.
Cool deal.
Yeah. Oh, and downloaded more Zim. New Zim.
Because you're the biggest pirate ever. Arr, arr.
We watched a cool video today that I got off the internet.
It's about teaching sex.
We'll get into it in the after birth.
we're going to make Jamie watch the journey afterwards.
You have to go home right after the show?
You can't sleep for a little bit?
But I want to tell!
Fine, tell. It's about teaching sex ed the retards.
It's an instructional video.
They were called trainers.
Trainables!
As you can actually think, diapers, trainables.
OK.
Anyway, we'll get into that in the afterbirth, which
is after the credits of the program.
God, our charem is such a bunch of moody bitches, I swear.
All the people I didn't say hi to,
like all of our regulars who've been here
weeks and weeks before, they get their FUs read every week
and everything.
Now they're all, why didn't you say hi to me?
Why didn't you say hi to me cry face?
Because you don't matter.
I'm trying to extend a warm welcome to the new people.
The old people should always already feel appreciated.
We love Orange.
I give a general shout out hello to the Orange Lounge chat
in general.
And I gave Jamie a dollar yesterday.
And he got spent a liquor.
Bitch, I bought you a drink.
You drink half of it.
That's neither here nor there.
So then without further ado, I'll
talk about my week and my day.
Because I actually have video game stories
to talk about. This week I actually went out and played DDR not once, not twice, but three
times. And Rob can count. Scary isn't it? And you know what's weird? I think this is
actually working because my pants are like about ready to fall off. It's like they're
down to here. I'm losing weight. This is so exciting. My ass is getting smaller with all
the studio I've been playing I'm so happy but anyway well I know but it's
it's it's it's not just that but it's that I've been playing it more in the
past month and I've been you know eating less crap I still eat crap but I'm
eating less crap and all that stuff
and now Iron Chef VHG is cooking me dinner I wonder what I need to bring in
I think Do It Right, the harmonized two step, thank you, I'm really close on that one too.
Oh, and 1998, anyway, so there's a lot of these sevens I'm really close on, but I haven't
done it yet.
I'm so close!
So there's been that, and Friday I went out there too, but I just played a couple games
because I was going to meet somebody more than anything on Friday.
And then, uh, yesterday was Chub's birthday party and I went with Dark Sakura to San Jose
and we went to Milpitas Golf Land.
I got to play some Horsey Crack, cause I haven't played in about three months, so I started
a new horse, and her name is Sana.
Oh, I retired Happy Bunny.
Yes, you retired Happy Bunny.
And bred a Kiriyamaoka.
Wow, you made a, you made a Kiriyamaoka breed, huh?
No, my horse, and who, who was the mommy horse?
One of Mel's horses, and they birthed a kiriyama oka.
Did you get any other rare horses?
I just have my three.
I saw a horsey on the top list, like the number one horse on the list was like a panda, but
it was brown.
Yeah, it was a chocolate panda.
That was neat.
How exciting.
To go with the chocolate martinis.
Yes, to go with the chocolate martinis.
Then what else was I thinking?
Oh, also the other cool thing about Derby Owners Club, I've never seen, for some reason
whenever I've been to play I always get like the outdoorsy tracks I've never
seen that track that's Sega and it's like nighttime and it has Sonic the
Hedgehog on it and stuff it's cute it's cute I like it I saw the coolest thing
though on horsey crack what a five-horse photo finish oh yeah I remember seeing
that the five-horse photo finish it's crazy five horses all finished with the
same seconds and like what thousandth second they all finished five of them it
stupid or whatever, but I never knew this before. There's little lights above all the
machines and if you're sitting in a machine and you're playing, and it can be anything.
Like if you're playing like some video game, you're playing like Hydro Thunder or something,
you hit the little switch and somebody will come by, little light lights up above the
machine, somebody comes by and says, oh can I get you a drink? And you go yeah, I want
a Midori Sour or something. And then they'll go get it and bring it to you. It's so cool.
Never though, try to pay somebody for a drink while you're in the middle of a game of Hydro
Thunder. Yeah, it was hard because I was playing... I got this place though. I was playing a game
ready to go, and when she came, I just used one hand to keep playing the game, the other
hand I handed her money and grabbed my drink. And, DarkSacker and I saw the coolest game
ever. That Rapid Racer. The Rapid Racer. That game is awesome. Oh, God. I know, it's, Loki
sent it somewhere else. Yeah, it's like when, they had that one, and it's also in the same
family of Namco games as, um, Prop Cycle. The Prop Cycle. What is, uh, Kayaking? It
was a kayaking game. Is that what you call it? Well, more like Inflatable Raps. Inflatable
River Rafting
I have my one martini and then we play the pump it up premiere 3 which I'd
never seen before but they had premiere 3 of pump it up there all the old crap
there's only one licensed recognizable song in the whole game and it's pink get
the party started coming up so you bet but it's really crazy because there's
parts it if you play it on crazy mode like they ain't fucking with you it
really is crazy you will be jumping around and like you'll have this freeze
that are the top two arrows because you know pump it up is five it's four
corners in the center so it's like the top two arrows and then you have to hit
the middle one with your hand and then the back two with your hand as well and
this is all in the span of about like one second it's crazy it's like a note a
12 footer it's it's sick so we were watching Chubbs and people try to do
that and it was really funny because Chubbs was really drunk and yes and he
was like doing it on the ground and stuff like she was like hand slapping
the biggest food court I've ever seen in my life, oh my God. They had like Chinese, Japanese,
Indian, McDonald's, steak. Yeah, it was a rip-off, but it was huge. It's so big. So
yeah, we did all that and then we got home last night at about 2 a.m. and then Loki and
are watching music videos until late. Which one am I talking about later? I don't know.
So, I guess we'll take a break? Unless anybody else has something they want to say?
Okay, let's do that. Let's play something on VR2. There's nothing new that hasn't been
in Japan already, but it's new to the US. There's just some interesting things on it,
You know what, looking at this, I'm not sure what to, because some of these are really
long.
Yeah, so I'll just play some of the game edits.
The Funk Disco Extended mix of High Lady.
Okay.
We'll do that.
We'll play...
That's a long one.
It's kind of long, so this will be the only song we play this break.
When we come back, we will talk about other stuff.
We'll talk about some Imani news going on.
Loki will give us a sim update and later tonight, by the way, I don't want to ruin it if it's your cage match pick.
Oh no, you're picking, you told me you were doing the paranoia thing, right? Tonight?
So we have a new Loki remix to debut tonight, yes?
Yes.
So we have a new Loki remix to debut a little later on in the program.
So, enjoy this from the DDR Max II V-Rare. This is Kind Lady, the funky disco extended mix, and we'll be back.
Logicity, Logicity, Logicity, Logicity, Logicity
He knew he had a charge and that's all it is
He worked him up to try again
But Grinchy cut it back
Ain't no man who's like the man
He knew he had a charge and that's all it is
I wouldn't know if he was in the mood for talking
So he began to play the game
Before he knew it, he had told her how much he'd been hurting
Though he was holding, she was not the same
Who would you be?
I'm afraid that I'm thinking after all of these crimes
Don't you be true love
She said, boy, you don't have to love me no more
I'll give the love you need to your father in love
Guaranteed, I'd like to rest forever
Finally, you deserve to see so good I am
I am but your own when you wake up late thinking it's just me
So fuck me boy, you know you can count on me, believe me
Baby, I'm just a lady, you know what you've found in me
You're the lady, the kind of lady that can give you what you need
Baby, I'm just a lady, that can never leave you lonely
The end was made up in the ladies
That's why the baby's down in your back

And after all of this time, could this dream be left?
She said, boy, you don't have to love me no more
I'll give the love you need till you holler and I'll guarantee
I'll cry forever
Hey, lady, you've been loved by people that I am but you
And when you wake up, baby, then it's a dream
So just before you know, you can count on me, believe me
Up in the lady, you know what she's got in me
Is a lady, kinda lady, that can give you what you need
I'm a lady, got my kind lady, that can help you
Leave you lonely, I'm just a lady
Up in the lady, finally we've got you
Up in the lady
Welcome back.
We hope you enjoyed that kind lady funk disco extended mix, all seven minutes of it, from
the USA V-rare 2 soundtrack and what's interesting about these soundtracks is that you know let
me just describe to you for those of you that didn't bother to visit our webcam when I had
them up earlier on the front of these they say limited edition music sampler then you
look on the back and they're very similar in the way they look they have a screenshot
from the game and they have the track listing and what's funny is it really shows the difference
between Max and Max 2 here because with DDR Max it says Dance Dance Revolution game features
over 70 songs and 100 plus minutes of authentic dance music. And then DDR Max 2 says the DDR
Max 2 Dance Dance Revolution game features over 65 songs and 100 minutes, exactly, of
authentic dance music.
You know what, there's a big rule that I try to remember, it's called never think while
you eat.
We'll just take a picture of it and put it in front of you while you're eating dinner.
will remind you of your ew. It'll look better when it's cooked, I know
it will. Then when you look on the side, it says in really, really tiny print, warning
all rights reserved, unauthorized duplication is a violation of applicable laws, printed
in the USA, V-Rare Soundtrack USA, and in the next it says V-Rare Soundtrack 2. So it's
kind of like, it's in really, really tiny print, but it's kind of a nod to the Japanese
V rare ones very very very rare it's very rare if it were meat it would still
be mooing actually for the record max 2 has 69 songs in it what a nice number
not quite 70 but 69 and I think max 1 had like 71 so yay
What else can I tell you about what's going on? What's going on in Bahmani News this week?
Anybody hear any interesting things? Yes, Loki?
I know some things, and if you don't mention them, I will.
Yes, Loki?
Okay. A bunch of shit's gone down this week.
Starting with, first off, more details about DDR Extreme.
It being that it's very similar to Max 2.
Ooh, surprise. Surprise?
Let's see.
There's going to be dancing characters. Ooh, surprise.
I know everyone's surprised.
I think we announced last week a stupid barber was going to be in there.
That type of shit.
I'm trying to think.
What else?
nothing really else uh... as far as you know do we know if the other songs are
going to be in it confirm yeah we probably did that we
uh... probably
that's no big deal though uh...
so they are not too much going on with DDRxtreme, they're not going to release too much more
infomeration because uh... obviously it's coming out in a couple weeks so you know
i don't honestly think there's going to be too much more unlocked in that game
than what they have, it'll probably be a stupid barber and guess what
uh... i found out today that forever sunshine is going to be forever ours in
the US, yes, that piece of shit, Forever Sunshine, is going to be pretty much replacing Let Them
Move in the US as the piece of shit track that they get to put on every single release.
Now wait a minute, last week we did have that vote and Let Them Move is still considered
the worst of the two songs.
Yeah, okay, so basically what you're saying is instead of Carrot Top, I have, I don't
No, I have that. They're both bad, but it'll still wear on you.
But anyways, enough with DDR Extreme, nothing going on there. The big news was in the Dance
Dance Revolution party collection, which they announced the new tracks.
And this is what's coming out after Extreme, and there's more news coming out on this mix
than there is on the other one.
First off, let's start with the new exclusive songs. Well, some of them exclusive, but anyways,
We have Freedom, the new Before You track, which no one gets a rat's ass about, Wanna
Be by the Spice Girls, which is also going to be in Dancing Stage with Peter, Try to
Love You, which was also in Max 2 USA, Stars, which was in pop and music, Stars in second
Naoki style, whatever that means.
I need you, the Inside Outdoor Mix, which is a remix of I Need You from Max 2 USA, and
And then a new Paranoia remix called Paranoia Respect by 0.3K
Just What the World Needs, another Paranoia remix
Which is probably going to be a 300 BPM Paranoia
And they announced a few more licensed tracks in here
Unfortunately I didn't know which ones were new than what we had last time
One of the ones I remember is Music, which is from 4th Mix
Oh, I love that song!
XSE from 5th Mix of course, Overblast was another one, it looks like it's a pretty decent collection of like songs in there, Moonlight Shadow, Missing Heart was pretty good, plus this game has selectable characters and you earn the characters as you go along, and that's another thing about DDRXtreme is you earn the characters as you go along, not all at one time unlocked like in Max2USA
And the selection screen for the characters is actually pretty cool.
They had a video that was on IGN that people grabbed shots from that were pretty cool.
You know what it reminded me of?
That character selection screen?
Have you guys ever played like one of those bootleg Nintendo carts?
It's like Mortal Kombat with 64 characters.
And they have all these little tiny pictures just all lined up in a big table.
That's what it reminded me of.
The character selection screen.
Because there's so many characters in this party collection.
So that's pretty much all that's going on there. Obviously it's going to be a re-skinned
Extreme engine. Can I bitch for a minute about something?
Yeah. I want to know why in the hell we're only
getting one new dance media license on this whole thing. That license being Wannabe by
the Spice Girls without the obvious that it was on the Euromix, so we're getting it
too, I mean, because, you know, there's a hundred songs I could bring over from one
of the USAs or Euromixes just because we got it. Wannabe by the Spice Girls was on, I believe
it was Zip Mania Best, it was on one of the Dance Mania albums, so... Dance Mania Diamonds,
the puppy, thank you. Easy, easy. Why waste any more effort on a compilation? But why
just one? There's so many... Because you'll buy it just the same! No, I won't! Not because
of that song. I mean, the Spice Girls are so five years ago. If this was five years
ago, fuck yeah, I would have eaten that shit up. But this is five years later and everybody
knows the Spice Girls are lame. But Japan isn't exactly on top of modern culture in
the U.S. I understand that. For them, the Spice Girls are like, whoa, that's so cutting
edge. I understand that, but why just one? I would rather they do none. If you looked
at Dance Mania, or if you looked at DDR best hits, there was nothing new about it. It was
just clear-cut, best tracks. You know, why give us these new tracks when they fucking
suck?
I don't know.
Well, I don't know about these Konami originals. They may be good. When I talk about Dance
Mania licenses, either you're going to take the effort to give us a lot of new Dance Mania
stuff, which would be nice and very well appreciated, trust me, and prove that DDR is not dead yet,
or you can give us crap. And that's what we're getting, is crap.
Now, aside from home versions, there was a little bit of arcade news this week. First
being DDR Extreme. If everyone remembers back to when they were first released to DDR Extreme,
it was beta testing and all that stuff, how there were some onis for some of the older
songs, just kind of like Lil' Bitch had some onis and stuff. But there was one step chart
that was going around forever that people were like, I can't find this in the game,
that's just got to be fake. You know, it was the Damderium Oni steps. Well, come to find
out, they were actually going to be in there, but they just cut them out at the last minute.
But thanks to the wonderful programming at Konami of Japan and their, you know, very
buggy DDR Extreme, you can, you too can play these wonderful step charts that never made
it in. And don't tell me Extreme does not feel rushed to any of you, because Extreme
is the most buggy of any DDR game they've released yet. 1998 just froze on me Thursday.
I played it for a song and it fucking freezes on me, but the neat thing is the arrow scroll
by really fast to catch up and you can still hit them if you're fast enough. It's kind
of challenging, but it also pisses you off. But anyways, what you do is you do the ONI
trick. For those who are not familiar with the ONI trick, you have to go to an ONI selection
screen or non-sub selection screen and you kind of switch back and forth until you switch,
I believe it's just above where you're looking for. So say, for instance, you want to play
Damdarium with the ONI steps. You pick a song, say, and what they've been doing is like the
player's best, so say Damdarium is like number six in player's best. So what you need is
you need to get an ONI, a song with just ONI steps, so basically one ONI remixes in number
two because, you know, they're gonna match up. So what you're gonna do is you put it
in there and you switch real fast, and then when Damdarium comes up, it's gonna have ONI
steps on it because you switched it really fast and DDR Extreme is just really cool.
to kind of reiterate that point for those that might not be getting it.
When, if you ever notice when you're switching around in the difficulties,
for just a minute when you're spinning that wheel on the ONI courses,
if you're on something, let's say you're on an ONI course that has all heavy songs,
for just like a split second, when you switch over to the one beneath it,
there might be a bunch of trick songs.
For like a split second, those trick songs will be listed in green.
Like it does that thing where it's collapsed and then it expands,
Well, like, right as it expands, it'll still be in that green color before it switches.
And that's the trick they're exploiting here.
Yes, um, the new Oni steps, they've got Damndarium, uh, singles and doubles, which are okay.
Um, they've got one for, um, what was it, Love Love Shine, that's new single Oni.
And then they have one that's just retarded for, um, uh, Blue Impulse.
Uh, or Alley Shadow.
Yeah, it's, all it is is completely blank and one freeze error at the very end.
It looks like one of my edits that I did to kick the can years ago called Big Cans.
It's one arrow at the end of the whole thing.
That's the one where, was it Rick and Timmy Nepal got off the machine and ran circles
around Golf Land and then came back and hit the last step.
Yes, that was my edit to Big Cans, which I never did finish.
Big Cans will always be only half the song.
I never finished it.
It's gone.
I think I deleted it.
Do you really? I found one of my old missing memory cards
that has my edits on it. What the hell is that noise?
Now, wait, real fast. I just want to say, this week as well, if you are a local player,
and I know Orange Land Radio is an international show, we have people listening to Japan and
everywhere, but if you happen to be in Orange Land headquarters in Sacramento, at Roseville
Golf Land, you can now play, Loki and my edits are in the machine at Golf Land.
Some of them. I'm working on them.
I'm getting some more. I'm making a new Legend of Max edit.
A new thing I was going to mention also, the last of the news, is there was a nice little
bootleg upgrade on eBay recently. It was Dance Dance Revolution Megamix, which included all
the songs from 4th, 5th, and Extreme. A nice little bootleg package there, which is actually
still up for auction right now.
seller ended the listing early because of the error in the listing
the item has been relisted
i don't see what they say
what are you reading here
i'm just reading the auction
this auction is for
for the ninth dance dance revolution upgrade kit named megamix this upgrade
includes all the songs of eighth
5th mix and 4th mix games. The kit includes marquee which looks like a piece of shit.
Upgrade instructions and software and hardware components to upgrade your 3rd mix and higher
DDR2 player machine. Like who will link this eBay auction in the
chatroom for all of you. Yes, it is just a piece of shit.
Now I noticed that you had posted about this over on Aaron in Japan and they were all kind
of going, obviously this isn't an official Konami release.
I did not post it in Japan. They had already posted it in there. I saw it actually earlier
in the week.
Oh, sorry.
Sorry, sorry. Then people started noticing it. But, you know, duh, obviously it's a bootleg.
But the most curious thing about this is whether it legitimately is 8th, 5th, and 4th or not.
No, it...
I am knocking my shit over. What are you doing? What are you doing? Those are my post-its.
No.
What the hell?
They have got information on them. It's important information.
Gosh. Sorry.
I like being overdramatic.
No, but anyways, no, it's a legit hack in the game, so
it does have all the songs that it claims it has, it's just that no one spent time
to create a marquee. I don't believe that the guy is telling you
that all the songs are in there, but I will not believe it until I see a video of it. Period.
Why? Because it doesn't make sense. How do all those songs fit on a CD? There's got to
be some kind of switch or something. They're doing something, either it's fake or there's
something really low tech about it. Easy! Easy, you take out the videos. That's okay,
so that's a possibility, but that's just what I want to know. I want to know more about
kostjamrh Is it really only a dollar right now? Maybe
p0k3smot42o I would laugh at whoever was stupid enough to bid on that
any more money for you right now. So what you do, you get a nice upgrade bootleg machine
anyways, since all of them are illegal over here anyways, and you take that and you put
it in your arcade next to your DDR Extreme, which is still making some money, and then
you make a new marquee for it, and whoa, there you go.
Are you assuming this thing works? Yes.
I wouldn't waste my money on the Nintendo. Hey, all the bootlegs for Max 2 and DDR Extreme
work, why would this be any different? Because they're bootlegs in the sense that they are
copies of Konami Official Things. No, they are hacked hardware. Somebody went in there
and not only hacked the hardware, but hacked the programming. Why is that problem? I just,
I don't believe it until I see a video. What are they showing here? They're showing a shoddy
marquee and they're not showing any in-game shots, anything about the game itself. We're
all going off just what this guy says, which, you know, okay, maybe it's right, you know,
but I just, I don't get it. It doesn't make sense. I want to know more about how this
is actually operating. Is it really all-in-one mix? Is it like one of those Taiwan 64-in-one
games where you pick one of the games before you start the game? What is this about? I
don't know enough about it and I would never spend $1,500 on it. I wouldn't. I would. If
I had the extra money, I'd definitely buy it. You're very crazy. Anyways, all right,
So there's that.
It smells like burning in here.
Yeah, it smells like burning because my VHD is cooking.
Hey!
You know what?
I don't like beer.
I know you don't like beer.
Oh yeah, you can drink all my Coronas and stuff that I've gotten there because I bought
those home for free.
Oh, I already told her she got one.
Except I sort of like Corona because it doesn't taste like American beer.
Someone drink the pale ale.
Seriously.
I'll take them home.
Okay.
OK. I think what we will do is we'll take another quick break. Can I play something?
What do you want to play?
We should play that paranoia remix.
Do you want to do your new mix?
Oh yeah, that's right.
Well, hmm.
Let's say a new remix.
Wait, it's a game. It's a game. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Talk about your new remix, Loki.
Well, earlier this week, we downloaded illegally off the Internet because we watched a video
about the bad things about piracy and how it hurts the record industry, and then we
said we don't care, so we went ahead and downloaded it anyways, since it sucked, and we downloaded
the brand new album for Enigma, Enigma 5, which sucks. I believe it's called Voyager.
Enigma, a great band. I love some of their stuff, like The Cross of Changes was an awesome
album. This new album, Voyager, fucking blows. Well, don't you want to queue it up? Anyways,
There is a song on there called Boom Boom, which is kind of neat, and so I mixed that with Echoes from 9th Style and I got no Boom Boom Echoed in My Head remix.
So this is going to be interesting because a lot of you guys may not have heard Echoes before. It's kind of one of the lesser known songs from 9th Style, but it's got a pretty cool backbeat to it.
Yeah, and I just totally mixed it around and that's actually pretty decent for a mix. It wasn't hurried along at all, so it turned out pretty well.
up pretty well. Alright, so here it is, the world premiere here on Orange Launch Radio
of Loki's latest remix. This is Boom Boom, the Echoed in My Head remix. And it's Enigma
Anigma versus Dragoon, Anigma versus Dragoon, we'll be back!
Alright, that was the world premiere of Boom Boom, originally by Enigma, but remixed right
there by Loki, the Echoed in My Head remix, so it had a little bit of echoes from Ninth
Style in there.
So, what'd you guys think?
Boomy.
Good.
Your chair attracts more microphone cord than like a pimp attracts hose.
Here you go.
What did you think of it, Bradley?
It sounded pretty cool.
Yeah, I liked it.
He definitely made that album better.
You know what pisses me off about Enigma now?
They were so good back when their first album and second album came out and they've gotten
progressively worse through albums three, four and five because the guy that does all
the writing is starting to use less samples and he sings more and just his
singing sucks starting to use less samples and more drugs basically
although I will say the fourth album has my favorite enigma song ever on it
gravity love which has a cool video on it as Loki saw last night so yeah
gravity of love good enigma song the entire Voyager album bad enigma song is
Is the video like watching a Bjork video?
And I left the CD at home.
Okay, we're going to break with some Bimani songs.
I'll play a couple songs that you can find. They're Bimani songs that are
typically in the game, but you can find them on the US V-Rare 2 soundtrack.
We're going to hear...
Oh, we played that first break, yeah. We're going to play the
Bad Routine,
and we'll play some Vanity Angel, because that's a good song.
And uh...
We can play the really shitty I feel mix.
Why not?
That's short.
All right, we're going to do the I feel mix.
We'll start off with the I feel mix here.
The New Age, here we go.
This is, well, judge for yourself,
the New Age hope mix of I feel is going to start off this break.
This is the New Age put me the hope of going to sleep mix.
And we will be back with the Orange Lounge cage match.
Yay.
Stay tuned.
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
and the CD is currently spinning
I FEEL!!!
You will not hear the crappy, I feel, because...
because...
DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH DEH...
COME ON!!!
well, we're going to eventually get this working
I feel it, I feel it in you, I feel it, I feel it in you
Ciao, ciao, ciao, ciao
I feel it, I feel it
I see-ee, I see-ee, I see-ee, I see-ee, I see-ee, I see-ee, I see-ee, I see-ee, I see-ee, I see-ee, I see-ee
I hear it, I hear it
Oh
I don't know what to say
YEAH!
Mr. Random person on the street, who by the way is not an actor, what do you think of
The music is like being transported to this dancing spaceship place.
It's unearthly.
It's like being at a club, except you don't have to ask someone to dance.
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening here, episode number
63 in progress.
We're going to get to the cage match in just a minute, but I wanted to ask you guys about
this site.
guys who were looking at this before the show. This is a site that somebody brought to my
attention earlier this week in our chat room. Just head on over to www.calibomani.com, click
on Orange Lounge and click on chat. The site is sexiestgamer.com. Have you guys seen this?
Hold on, I'll bring it up over here for you guys that haven't seen it yet. And those of
the whole idea behind Sexiest Gamer is about. Our mission is to prove to the world that
gamers are not joystick jockeys glued to their keyboard. Our search for the sexiest gamer
gives you, male and female gamers, the opportunity to send in your hottest gaming-related pic.
Visitors to the site will be able to rate the hotness of each entrant. We all know that
being a babe means different things to different people. You don't need to be a supermodel,
anyone can enter. Time to get on down. The first round of voting for all selected entrants
starts on the 2nd of October and continues until the 20th of November. Based on the first
round of voting, 10 finalists will be selected. Voting will then begin on the finalists. On
the 12th of December 2003, a live grand finale will be held in front of a celebrity judging
panel. The finalists will be asked gaming and personality questions and based on their
performance and their results from the second round of online voting, the judges will select
the male and female winners. And they win a trip. I'm thinking, I'm thinking that Orange
Lounge, tell me what you guys think about this. I'm thinking Orange Lounge has a large
and sick enough fan base, tell me what you guys think about this, that maybe I should
enter. What do you guys think? Should I enter this? Do it? Would you guys vote me a ten
if I entered I'm serious you guys I'm not going to do it if you guys are going
to back me up and that includes the chat room all right
where's your beer
I don't know what happened to your beer Jamie.
I have to think about, Jamie what do you think, should I enter this?
Would you enter it too?
No.
Why not?
I want some female needs to enter to represent Orange Lounge Radio.
Erin!
I think you need to enter.
Yes, I think you need to enter the sexiest gamer competition with me.
It'll be me and you, we're going to win that trip.
We will get our Orange Lounge Radio legions of fans to vote for us the sexiest gamer.
But this is the thing is that there's so many assholes in the Bamani community
that they're going to go and vote us a one just because it's us.
we have to vote over and over and over them
in order to pull this off
if it's IP, log on to a dial-up account and do it
I don't know, I'm thinking about it
we'll have more details as we go on, but think about it
because if Aaron or I could win this thing
then we could go on to gamer.tv and whore the shit out of this station
tell me that's not a beautiful idea
all right
yes we will wear sexy orange clothes
we will wear nothing but orange lounge shirts and pictures
you need an orange lounge suit
an orange lounge suit
no i'm serious aaron are you going to enter this shit if i do it?
i will see what we can do
Some more to come in future weeks on that.
We'll let you know next week where the sexiestgamer.com project stands.
In the meantime, how about we have ourselves a cage match? How does that sound?
Sure!
Good, I'll give you guys some music to listen to while you're eating.
Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match,
there was another tie,
But the winning song was a little bit surprising, at least to me anyway.
My song won, and it was a song that was suggested to me by The Ice Bitch, who hasn't been to
a show in a while, but he suggested this before the show last week.
It's kind of a booty song, it's a song that maybe you could hear one day on Solo 2000,
something like that.
This song is like the epitome of booty.
Well, here it is.
This is the song that won last week, and the first song you can vote for tonight.
Wait cage match works. Just a reminder. You have to be in our chat room to participate. It is a listener supported event
www.calibamani.com click on orange lounge and click on chat
I'm gonna play three songs for you guys after the three songs are over you vote on your favorite the winning song goes into rotation
All week long on orange lounge radio comes back next week
So since this song won last week, you only get to hear a clip of it. Here's last week's
No, sorry, you can hear a clip of it. That's the rule
It's not fair to the other songs.
It's not fair to the other songs.
This is song number one tonight.
The band is Fanny Pack and the song is Camel Toe.
Enjoy.
This little aged lady, I gotta be blunt.
I'd spend this mic as short as work, creepin' up the front.
I could see her uterus, her pants was in sight.
She mustn't own pennies if we're not in sight.
She walked right by, the poor woman didn't know.
I can see her uterus, her pants was in sight She mustn't own pennies if we're not in sight
She walked right by, the poor woman didn't know She had a pencil wedgie, a camel toe
You got a camel toe, girl, you got a camel toe
You got a camel toe, girl, you got a camel toe
Girl, I gotta hurt, take some time in the dust
Can't you see people staring at making the fuss
Cannot believe my eyes have to take a second place
If you crash hungry girl, cause you're eating your pants
Do you enjoy the commotion and the tension it brings
The only lips I wanna see are the ones that sing
And public put it on, and x-ray the show
Go see people out with your camel toe
Mm-hmm, that's right, uh-huh, I don't know
Think you so, girl, you got a camel toe
You got a camel toe First time spin round, let's make these girls
Alright that was song number one Fanny Pack with Camel Toe
Last week's winner Okay let's get on into our next song
Next song will be Loki's song Why don't you tell us about it, Loki?
This song is featured on the Diverse System CD, Hello Boss, which is a remix CD of all
Bomani music.
They are done by these independent artists from Japan who do a lot of the BMS files you
find out there.
We are talking quality music, the best beatmania files you will ever find out there.
It's definitely not this crap that you would see in a turning mix or something like that.
This is really quality music.
they sell a CD in Japan, Diverse Systems. Anyways, this song is called P-H-1-0-7. Now,
what the 8-1-0-7 means, I don't know, but it's a remix of Paranoia that's fucking awesome.
So, this is OnoKen with P8107.
I keep reading that as PB, I have peanut butter on my mind.
Let's go around and get votes from our studio.
What other than that is like a different part?
blow the crap out of whatever this paranoia respect piece of shit's gonna be.
So, um, it's way better, and this is another example of how Konami has failed this as a
company in producing a quality dancing game. So, um, you know, you can really save yourself
a lot of money and license some of these independent artists to make really kick-ass music for
almost nothing. But no, go ahead, license your expensive tracks that suck ass like Wannabe.
p0k3smot42o
And then you've got like Pernodie Evil that sounds like Krab going, AHHHHH!
Or Pernodie Red which has almost no rhythm into it.
This blows the shit out of any fan-made Pernodie remix basically.
The only one I can actually see that's acceptable was probably Pernodie Massive.
I think this is a lot better.
Alright.
Did your friend that you brought along want to comment on this at all?
You want omelet?
No, he's...
Seven.
Seven.
Alright, Bradley.
Pretty good, but I'm not as impressed by it as you people are, but I'll give it an eight.
Okay, an eight from Bradley.
Violent Hypergirl, Chef Iron...
Violent Chef Girl.
Exploded yet it hadn't so I wasn't sure but now that I've heard it
It's actually good, and I like it, and I give it a 10, and I just hope that we aren't all dead tomorrow
All right
Chatter seems to really take a liking to that one, but you guys it's not over yet
We have one more song in the cage match, and it's Jamie's entry and watch tell us a little something about it Jamie
It's Delirium, after all, remixed by Svensson and Gyllen.
And they did the depend on you, Ayumi Hamasaki.
Ah, yes, a very popular trance mix of a Yumi Hamasaki from my U-trance.
So, Svensson and Gilen with Delirium, featuring Jaiyo, I believe is the name.
I didn't even want to try it.
With a song called After All.
Anything else you want to say about this before we play it?
It's a good song.
Alright, here it is. Jamie's pick for tonight. Enjoy.
It's like a melody
I'm so sad it's become a bad strategy
You know I think of you now
Cause you are keeping nothing inside
No guilt or care
No need to leave
We're messing up the night
Everything runs out
And you won't be allow,
And you won't be getting put away from her love.
She said she wasn't her that was representation.
And you won't be getting put away from her love.
She said she wasn't her that was representation.
No time to say goodbye
Love is red, but it's green inside of me
After all she sees my left hand side
But being a girl, she looks like a
Picture behind a closed eye
Okay, that was song number three, Delirium, featuring Jayo, with after all the Sensen
kostjamrh It's a good contrast to the other song too, and certainly to song 1, because it has vocals. It's nice, I like it, I dig it.
The first time is on numerous CDs, so it's really worn out to me.
Plus, I have the CD. It's somewhere around here.
Oh.
No, that's... Yeah. Eh. Eh.
Well, all right. But is it the Spencer and Gillen mix?
Eh. Eh.
Give it a number already.
I give it number...
Two.
No, I'm joking. No, I give it a...
Eight.
I'll give it a 9. I like the song, the lyrics, the way they actually did the trance itself. It doesn't make it sound like no GTS or generic trance shit.
Alright, Bradley.
That's pretty good. I'll give it an 8.5.
Silent Hypergirl.
kostjamrh It's a decent song, it didn't really catch my attention and suck me in, like a song I like would have, so I'll give it an 8.
All right, that's the vote.
That's interesting.
Both songs entered it against last week's winners.
Nobody gave either one anything below an 8, which is kind of interesting.
I don't think it's ever happened before, usually someone's giving someone else a 4.
No, you can't change your vote.
Too late.
So, all the songs are well liked by the studio tonight.
They're saying except number one.
Well, number one won last week, so somebody liked it.
Here's a quick recap before we let you vote and you will be voting by sending private
messages to Sky but here you go, here's a quick recap.
Song number one, Fanny Pack with Camel Toe is the first song you can vote for tonight.
Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is P8107.
Alright, song number three you can vote for tonight is Delirium featuring Dalil with After
After all, the Svensson and Gielland mix.
Alright.
Place vote now.
If you don't know how to do that, you can either double click on somebody's name or
You guys have about three minutes to place your votes for the CAGEMATCH.
So Jonas, you showed up before we got into CAGEMATCH.
What's new with you?
We haven't seen you in a while.
Oh, not much.
College.
We made a few DWIs.
And you want to plug those?
Where can people find them and what are they called?
What's on my website? www.gameroom.com
slash explicit
Hold on, let me see if you were typing it right.
Huh? What are you going to do here? Just make sure you spell explicit
right, because if you spell it wrong, you get the wrong link.
Like that?
Okay, x x x p l i z i t
The last time I came here, I've only had like around 7 SIM files, now I have like 11 released,
including Paranoia Massive, for those of whom I've tried out.
Who's the friend that you brought with you tonight?
That's my cousin.
Oh, your cousin.
Let's say hello to the cousin.
Is he?
Oh, he's a little radio shy.
Yeah, he's one of the buildings on the roof.
Oh, OK.
This is Erwin.
Hi, Erwin.
How you doing?
He's quiet, all right, all right, that's fine.
That's fine.
Let's see, what else is new?
Loki, you got a minute over there?
You got a minute over there, Logie?
Here he comes.
I just wanted to know if you would tell us about, don't tap the mic, because that goes
over there, if you tell us all what's going on in the Sim World.
There's some stupid contest.
It's called Turnumix 4.5 Plus, my ass.
It's not important, so you shouldn't care.
Too late.
There's some contest that takes place in the middle of the two tourney mixes, like we care.
It's got all Asian music because they're hating us Westerners over here.
So, you Westerner haters.
Oh no, that's done.
No, it's all Asian music, yada yada yada.
And stuff happens, people are excited, I don't care.
That's it, it's just another tourney mix.
The only reason why they entered tournament 4 plus is because people are sick and tired of this anime and trance category being plaguing tournament 4.
Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that that music is popular.
I know.
Let me bitch some more about my tournament that I'm holding.
Don't hold it then if you don't want to bitch about it.
I know.
Friggin' A. We're not going to miss it.
Hello, there's a site called Bomani Sims, or should I say Bomani Style.
New music comes up there all the time.
it's not all trance and you know anime music other music exists out there but
you limit everyone by what you can put in there so you don't get anything good
stop whining in fact there's been some real shit on the money styles I think I
see some country songs in there and some just some weird shit yes I agree term
mix is run by stupid people well some super people how the hell they put
Legend of Art 3rd place in T4
Here's a hint. I would like to just give the tourney mix planners, the people who plan the next tourney mix, some advice.
And let me tell you something here right out the gate. No matter what you do, people are going to bitch that the contest sucks.
So don't even listen to us, don't listen to the chat room, whatever. If you're happy doing your thing, do your thing, okay?
Because somebody's going to not like it and you're just going to have to deal with that. That's part of doing things and having a big tournament.
So, tourney mix five, if you do it. This is my suggestion. You need to do it like American Idol style, basically.
where when people submit their entries you not be afraid to reject them
on the spot because there is too much shit that's getting in through the
the cracks and people are wasting their time and your bandwidth downloading them
and if people do not put the effort to make original backgrounds
some sort of song that needs to have some audio quality set on it
they need to be 192 or whatever quality they need to have some kind of audio
quality
set on it. If they're not meeting these minimal standards do not waste my bandwidth
1. Learn how to draw. It's not that hard if you can't draw, take someone's picture, make it look nice, put a title on it, done. Give credit where it's due.
2. Don't draw shit in paint, it looks like crap. And I've seen so many sim files where the banner art and stuff is just like utter shit. I don't care if you can't draw, it's not that difficult.
Use fucking Photoshop filters, it's not that hard. I don't draw that much in Photoshop, but I use filters out of the ass, and it looks good.
So, just do that, and just, you know, pick good songs, you know, pick this crap, cut it good if, you know, you're good at that.
Make sure the steps sync and make sense and aren't insanely hard, and number one of all things they should do is do not put who made the file on the file.
Because when you do that you make people want to play these files because, oh, it's this person and they won't play the file, they'll just vote because they like this person.
No, if you don't put, you know, what person is...
BMR.
Yeah, what each file is and who each file is made by. If you don't put that on there until the very end when all the voting is done, then you'll get a more fair vote.
But when you go ahead and put, you know, who made each file and all this stuff and when you have people, you know, promoting their files like that.
I don't care if you promote your files, but the fact is that people are only voting like 30 people voted on one file
Which might have been pretty good, but you know the ones that suck like max whatever that was I don't
The neo max neo max you know what oh wow oh you made your own little thing out of a MIDI program with you know
fucking
Fruity loops what they do should I pat you on your back?
I don't give a fucking shit if you made that song cuz it sucked. It's just another max remix that sucks
So what if you put more work into it? I put work into Legend of Trance, and you know what, I don't give a shit if it sucks.
It's fine. You don't see me bitching about it. But here's the thing, is everyone's like,
Oh, it's the BNDDR, it's so cool!
No, I'm sorry, the thing I just played a little bit ago, you know, the Paranoia remix,
that was 100,000 times better than your fucking song.
Okay? That's what I have to say about that.
Now, the fact, and that's another thing, is people are like,
Oh, well I wanna, you know, vote for this, because...
And they didn't really play the song, they just voted for it because they're like,
Oh and you, Max is so cool, oh my god, this guy beat DDR.
That also gets me into one point. Like, you know Boomerang, right? He's been done by BMR, right?
He just re-edited the steps, putted it on, people just overrated his ass.
With some of the things I've heard out of there, I think that a very loud fart would sound better than some of those.
And I thought he quit making sim files like three years ago.
Oh no, come on now!
here's okay here's my this is why maybe I'm just gonna kind of play devil's
advocate here and tell you why maybe they have not gone to the anonymous
system let's say you submit in a file to the tourney mix and it's anonymous
whatever but let's say I do it now everybody knows I'm not gonna enter
tournaments because I know I'm not talented enough I go in and then I come
on this station and say oh hey by the way you guys I entered to become one by
the Spice Girls in the contest and you all need to go vote for it at ten well
there I've just fucked up the whole anonymous thing how are you gonna keep
an entry. And then I come on Orange Lounge Radio and say, hey guys, look for my entry,
such and such. Vote for it at ten. Well, now haven't I just ruined the whole anonymous
thing? No, because guess what? Not everyone gets on this radio show and promotes their
files except for me. But what about, let's take somebody like the well-known people that
this is what you're trying to prevent is you're trying to prevent the well-known people from
winning every time basically just because of the well-known ones and they're the ones
to get their files downloaded. Well, now all these well-known people post on boards, and
some of them will post their own shit. They're proud of their stuff, as they should be.
That's just 1.2. Well, fine. Just make a rule against it. That's
pretty easy. It's like they didn't rule about distributing files.
But you're not a big brother. You can't see everything.
Yeah, but there's thousands of little minions of mine that are running around boards, waiting
to, you know, fucking turn this bastard in, because they also have a SIM file posted in
I know.
Can I say something about the tournament mixes and all the sim files?
Oh hell why not?
Well there's like a lot of people I know that are like underrated and making sim files but
when I download some of them they're actually hella good just for the quality of the steps.
Now the other thing, when is Sivis, the guy that runs DDREI, what does he know about sim files? I don't see him making shit.
Now where is he? You've got MoogleHunter, he knows how to make sim files. He would be a good judge.
I'm on your ruler, he's made sim files.
But he has hard files, that's the only problem.
It's fine, he's made sim files, he ran a sim file site, that's different.
You've got the guy, those should be the judges we have.
What are all these other people going like, oh, well your file sucks ass because I don't like trance music.
Sorry you don't like trance music, but you know what, that doesn't have anything to do with this.
They're like judging the song. I don't like this song. It's a sim file contest. It's about the file, not the fucking song.
I don't care if you don't like this song.
Or like, people who have made those SM errors, you know, step mania errors.
Oh yeah, well step mania sucks.
Well, that's maybe if DWI fucking updated their goddamn program within the last six months, you know, we'd have people using that.
But I'm sorry, because StepMania is like 100,000 times better than DWI, so why don't you just have a StepMania contest?
I know, seriously.
Well, because StepMania is so that people can make files easy, because they're not doing it old school in Notepad.
Cry, cry, cry some more for me.
The whole point of this thing and the argument we get down to at the very end every time is that this tournament sucks.
The tournament sucks, just don't enter it, just whatever.
That's what I do. I don't enter it. I don't give a shit. I just, at the very end, I download the files, weed out, like, the 10 that are any good, and delete the rest. And that's what I do with everything.
I don't know. It looks like TurnMix is, like, a buyout, because anyone can throw, like, a porno video and get a number one spot on the TurnMix, even though that's just a quote.
It's just a big joke. The whole thing's a joke. It was good when it was just, like, a little fun content.
I was thinking about entering 34 plus just for the hell of it.
Use that with existing sim files.
I think I'm going to use that song from Winds.
I'm not about it.
I don't care anymore because, you know, if I want to get quality sim files, they're not
made by U.S. people. They're the Japanese people that are making the sim files. They're
the people back from when Dance Dance Evolution, that site was around. Back when Fifth Mix
was coming out for the arcade and sim files were coming up for that back in Delight Delight
Duplication. This site was up. This was the only place where you could get all your official
no steps. This was the site, and it was run by Japanese people, and they also had originals,
which had all difficulties, and they were, you know, intelligent steps, really nice backgrounds,
professional, done everything. And you know what? When that site died, people didn't realize
that the small site with the originals is still up, and you know what? I get sim files
from there, and they're a hundred thousand times better than all these stupid sim files
that people make. Well, this is most, actually, because, you know, people just don't give
shit about how about looking at their steps and there's a lot of crap
floating around out there because everyone thinks that they can make shit
and I was like it takes time to make some fun that's why I don't place that
mania anymore I don't but I won't wanna get my cabinet are you boys finished
venting now all right let's talk about I think we need to change the pace with
the rest of you think you're all right let's see how about we announce the
Tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge Cage Match, I have to say this, song number one,
My pick didn't get a single vote, so we had last week's winner did not get a single vote
and between the other two fairly close, a lot of people voting, but in the end the winner
was P8107.
People felt very strongly about one song or the other though just looking in our chat
room, so we'll just see what happens next week when P8107 comes back and does battle
against two new picks.
There's also another song that OnoKid did, you can play it at a later break. Yeah, we'll
do that one later. Hi Jamie. Hi. Do you feel a little ranty after listening to all that
venting? I took a nap during the ramp. Did you? Okay. Cause Corona makes me sleepy. Oh,
We are going to take a break and when we come back you need to be woken up so you can do
some ranting.
I need to go club a seal.
You need to show these two how it's done.
Okay.
Alright.
Alright, we'll be back, we're going to take a quick break, we're going to start off, I
thought we'd start this off with Echoes from Night Style so those of you that were listening
to Loki's remix before can kind of hear what he had changed and all that stuff.
And then some other stuff, something from Guitar Freaks, something else from Night Style.
We will be back.
Yeah, yeah
Move on now
Reach up and feel the beat
Come on, wake up
Let all your energy be
And in the back of your mind I smile
Blind in blood, so blind
Just reach out, get off and out
You'll be the star tonight
Get with it
Finalize
You gotta tell me
You know you should do it when you're dead, my man
I should lie
And set you strong, but
You're not the answer to keep you warm
Hey, hey, hey
I just feel it
You gotta feel it, yeah, yeah
I'm a
I'm a

Hello, everybody.
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
We hope you're having a good time listening.
number 63 in progress. We're going to get to the FUs of the week. But first, some quick
station housekeeping announcements and things like that. Just a reminder, we do have other
shows here on Orange Lounge Radio now. On Monday nights at 7 o'clock, me, Vanilla Sky
is the show, and Rice Princess and Lanky Style also come over and visit, and Loki makes cameos
all the time. And we talk about game news and then other stuff going on. And tomorrow
night show I will make my official endorsement for California governor and
since my initial candidate I was going to vote for dropped out of the race I'm
going to be endorsing someone else and the the answer may surprise you so tune
in tomorrow the answer may surprise you so tomorrow to find out unicorn yes
Tuesday Jamie what's on Tuesdays Tuesday is pump up the volume which is my
request show. If you were hanging out in the chatroom, make a request. You might hear what
you want played because I have tons and tons and tons of MP3s. So that's where I basically
hold up my hand, extend the middle finger toward the RIAA. But I'm thinking of breaking
out. I picked up the soundtrack for Initial D Special Stage, which is the PS2 Initial
just until November. That is correct. It's on break because I'm building a cabinet and
I need extra days. Also, working on something else for 2004, I like to call it the SC2K4
project which only, I think, one other person knows about. And it's going to be very, very
complex if I pull it off. That's something to look forward to in 2004. Also, something
else to look forward to in about one month, Orange Lounge Radio is going to be upping
the stream quality. Don't worry, modem listeners will not be shut out. Modem listeners will
still be able to connect as always, and it's going to be great because the music is going
to sound, if you have the correct codec loaded into Winamp, and if you don't, it's okay,
the station will still play. It won't sound as good, but it'll still sound better than
it does now even but it's gonna play DSL quality radio on a 56k stream so it'll
be really nice for some of you guys that's in about one month as soon as
live 365s get all gets all their gets all their getting another kick to the
for being stupid. Alright. There it is. Alright, so now I think, Jamie, it's your turn to take
Alright, so, now I think, Jamie, it's your turn to take the stage and give us some rants.
How's that sound?
Sure.
Oh, this is bad.
Here is justice.
Here is punishment.
Here.
This is fucked up.
Oh, this is bad.
Here is justice.
Here is punishment.
Here is...
This is fucked up.
This is fucked up.
This is fucked up.
One night allergies wanted to murder me through my nose.
I was going to be dead, but I took a shower instead.
Another one goes toward corona and apple juice for making me burpee.
This is the sparkling apple juice which is the best stuff in the world.
Another epi goes toward all the stupid people that were on the road today.
I hate them all and wish that they would wreck their cars far away from me.
And another one goes to the stinky old man in my apartment complex, who walks around
smoking cigars.
Really stinky, cheap cigars.
And the thing about really stinky, cheap cigars is that they make me so nauseous smelling
them that I have been known to throw up before.
Yes, very disgusting.
So this old man stops me, because I usually, you know, just sort of touch my hand under
my nose when I walk past him so I don't have to smell it.
He's like, Hey, do you have a problem? Do you have a problem? And I just kept walking. But next time he does that, I'm gonna say, Yeah, it's you and your stinky smoke. So
I have a problem with how he stinks and what I have a problem with.
Another one goes toward my car in Meinecke for misdiagnosing my car potentially. It may not be the head gasket. It may be the valve job.
And another F.U. goes to all the people who have said that they're going to sign up for my message board and haven't yet.
It's just, it's, I don't, that's why I said, the people who said they were going to sign up and didn't.
It's, it's, uh, willplay.duckchakra.com, sign up for it or I'll kill you.
Um, that was beautiful.
p0k3smot42o
I listen to me, I listen to you all the time.
Oh, oh my god, yeah, yeah, yeah.
How expensive everything was at Dave & Buster's and how I didn't have more alcohol.
And that's it.
Alright, Loki, you're next.
My feet and myself were mismeasuring every single aspect of everything on my DDR pad,
thus making them one hell of a mismatch of pieces.
FU the old people because you drive too slow and you should die.
FU is just VMB for not seeing me in my tags yet because I got pulled over by a cop who was saying that my registration was expired.
But then after checking with his little dispatcher, found out that my registration wasn't expired.
That's pulling me over for no reason.
But he was nice about it and didn't write me a ticket like the guy last year.
And then FU to all the women that are saying Arnold Schwarzenegger molested them in some way.
you wanted a piece of that? You know you did, okay? He's a big hunky guy, don't tell me
you didn't want any of that. Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh. You're just mad now that he's becoming,
you know, a political figure and you're not, you know, you're not with that. So don't be
a hater, don't be a hater, okay? And don't tell me, like, that this stuff isn't, like,
totally just because, you know, he's gonna win the election. Because, you know, that's
why you're coming out, like, a few days before, like, oh, I just now got the courage to tell
duke, i thought you guys molested me or touched my ass or something like that
whatever, it's like a big coincidence that we don't know this and davis is like oh i didn't pay these people at all to say this stuff, not at all
um, so f u them
and um, f u to um, roe
because you got mauled by a tiger
and you know what?
maybe if you weren't like, you know
The Tiger was jealous because you weren't showing it any love. You were loving the other lions and tigers and bears, oh my.
The Tiger just couldn't understand why you liked the small penis but not the big penis.
Anyways, F you to Game Show Network for airing that show called Who Wants to Be the Governor of California.
Never in my life have I seen a more retarded show.
If anything, Mary Carey should never run for office ever.
In fact, she should just kind of disappear because no one wants to hear her talk.
Because she's an idiot. A complete idiot.
But you know what? This is why I think she should win.
Because I would like at this point to see California just crash and burn.
Like the big space shuttle crash earlier, you know?
It's just like, just burn. I just want to say, go down and just die. California just needs to die, you know.
And, oh yeah, F you to the government for actually searching for weapons of mass destruction. You ain't going to find them.
Stop wasting, just cop to it, you know, we didn't like, we made up that there were, you know, weapons of mass destruction, but what are you gonna do? We already destroyed them and now we're rebuilding them. Get over it.
FU to certain websites out there that have flash or shockwave animations that play music
when you go to their goddamn site every week until you turn that shit off. No one wants
They hear it.
It's annoying.
Turn it off.
Your global flash animation.
Cool.
Music.
Not cool.
Finally.
F.U. to sports.
I don't care.
Why do the rest of you?
F.U. to Dave and Busters because everything is so expensive there and you kicked everyone
out at 1030 that was under 18 or I mean under 21 sorry over 18 but under 21 and
you know screw that we weren't there we were their escorts we were their parents
for the evening why you got to kick them out they weren't drinking most of them
weren't some of them were I mean my god they're really bad about letting we were
totally sharing drinks with other people and it was you know hey it was nothing
but on the bright side I got a lot of people to come say they would come visit
orange lawns in future so that was good we have a lot of guests coming from the
Bay in future weeks. That was nice. Yeah, they can find me out here in the middle of nowhere.
I think that's pretty much it. I don't have a lot of FUs. FU did the recall. I just can't
wait until this whole stupid thing is over. It should never happen in the first place.
And FU did cell phones going off mid-show. Just kidding. I'm kidding. Oh, come on, Aaron.
Yours does it all the time, so does mine. I'm kidding.
Um...
Oh, F you to Walmart, Target, and the bookstore,
and Ralph's, and the paper store, and the Folsom Outlets,
because none of them carry giant birthday cards.
And I'm too lazy to go all the way to Sunrise Mall.
You people need to be more practical and think about my needs, because the world revolves around me.
p0k3smot42o
victor my name is not meant to be written in leet to stop it
first of all
fuck the eye
no one wants to pay twenty dollars for your shit
come on we've downloaded mp3's for a reason
to just try and see if it's a good music and all
who wants to spend twenty bucks for a sucky song
yeah exactly
fuck some bitches try to shit on my car
yeah i have to clean it up and shit
fuck some dog trying to lick my balls off
okay
at that
what were you doing with your balls exposed to a dog so they can lick them
okay i was outside
running
and suddenly some dog tried chasing me
Remember, it's not cheating if you put some peanut butter all over your balls and have a dog wick it off.
I guess Greg and Claudio agree on me with this, FU to math homework, lots and lots and
lots of math homework, do we have a test in like a week, unfortunately, god damn mid term.
FU to stinky people who play Initial D
or it's that particular large fat
nerdy looking smelly guy that beat claudia
at Initial D. She knows who I'm talking about. He was the equivalent of one of those really really fat
glasses wearing anime nerds
who take japanese just to figure out what they're saying. They can watch their enemies unsub. Etc.
FU to Sean Davis of ECS 30, who is not teaching us any programming, who is going straight through everything and not actually teaching, because I don't know anything about programming.
And yeah, I think that's it.
And FU to Nosan for Para in IRC. Para is dead! Get over it!
That was the one Bamani game nobody was playing in Miggle yesterday.
I'm going to make Para's once I get my controller and get it running in StepMania.
I'm going to make Para's for Mac 300.
I'm going to work on my X-rated Para game, so just wait.
Hey, I'd play that.
I will bring Para back single-handedly or double-handedly,
double-handedly depending on the technique.
I don't care about that!
just wasted my time watching it was hilarious I guess I have another one to
put it on f you to work load 57 for being the most boring and shittiest
class in on all of earth I want to die now so yeah
Bradley uh did you fuck you to the job market and being evil fuck you to
waiting for find out if I got a job or not fuck you for being discouraged that
I probably won't I didn't do well enough or something let's see well fuck you too
you too wandering my money for being lazy first way way way way way way way
way too long
and uh... fuck you to
stupid americans who don't know math and hate math homework
math rules!
hahahaha
yes i was a math major and chemistry
hahahaha yes both
best of them lately that's not because i know math
hahahaha zing
do anything except find it out.
kostjamrh Just to interject something here, Think Free and Roy, the show is probably going to be cancelled forever.
your turn
begin by saying fuck you to the following ionic compounds
silver sulfite
stannous sulfate
do not bring chemistry onto this program
i had to
okay i'm sitting here working on my fucking chemistry homework right now
that's how bad it is
is this fucking chemistry altogether
i hate having to do
dizzy work like this
p0k3smot42o
kostjamrh Yes, the People's Republic. I actually took that real life comic and put it up as my desktop picture so I could view it.
kostjamrh Yes, Davis Made Famous by Real Life this week, that comic.
kostjamrh The guy who draws us from the same town we are.
kostjamrh Fucks the people at the UC Davis arcade for taking way too fucking long to go through applications for jobs because it's been a month since I turned in my application and they still haven't reviewed it yet.
p0k3smot42o I have no enemies
I have no enemies.
I don't make enemies.
Can't we all just get along?
I think it's like whoever made Murder Burger changed their name.
Because as cool as it is to have Red Rum Burger, it was as cool as Murder Burger.
I need to go eat there.
On the bright side, we just found out there's a Red Rum Burger in Folsom.
We're going to go there one night.
I haven't had the murder burgers yet because it's on Sutter Street.
Ostrich?
Just to answer, puppy, I wanted red meat because I really wanted a hamburger, but I don't eat
beef anymore and I can't really digest it very well, so I had an ostrich burger.
Ostrich sounds strange.
It's yummy.
It's really yummy.
Who's next?
Yes Erin
F.U. goes to TapX Pads in Davis
Because we opened them up
Friday night
And we found
We found enough soil to pot a plant
So yeah
Yeah
It's that bad
F.U. to TapX for never cleaning their pads
We will comment on them and make fun of them.
AznBuddyPaul says, F you to school work and F you to negativity.
That's it.
Chaos would like to say, F you to Love is Drowning, original soundtrack version from
Night Style, because the singing makes my ears bleed.
Is that a Polteri song?
I don't know.
Oh, we need to play that new Polteri song that Loki found a little later.
Maybe we'll save that for next week, or maybe we'll do it when we come back after F yous.
Baka would like to say, my F you of the week goes to Initial D players of Riptide for being
such pains in the asses.
the machine and hog the F-Zero machine and call it the initial D on crack. They don't
know shit about F-Zero and why do they play it? Because the machine gives out free cards,
bastards. BHG would like to respond to you. Well, tell us something we don't know. Come
on now. Every time I go here, it's like all the same things. All right. Minsk would like
to say F-you to the entirety of my college physics department. All the professors have
the teacher to ask me if I knew the difference between Nico and Inu. One page had a cat,
the picture of the other had a dog. Look lady, teach us to count Japanese before you call
out page numbers in Japanese. Marin would like to say, oh by the way, Marin
made a funny earlier. She said, Siegfried's been mauled by a tiger before. If they stop
sleeping with the tigers, they might not get mauled so much. Marin would like to say, here
here be my f-u of the week. Add to you the financial aid office at the local college.
Apparently they didn't distribute any of my financial aid money to any of my classes.
So I got a lovely letter in the mail yesterday from the administration office saying that
I have a total attempt- Wait, wait, wait.
To pay for all my classes otherwise I'll be removed from all of them.
Shred that over. Well if you guys would listen.
No, no, no, because I can actually comment on this one.
Alright. Add to you to the financial aid office at the local college. Apparently they didn't
to distribute any of my financial aid money to any of my classes. So I got a lovely letter
in the mail yesterday from the administration office saying that I have until the 10th to
pay for all my classes otherwise I'd be removed from all of them.
Speak to the director of financial aid if they won't help you contact the Department
of Education and turn their asses in. I should know.
Straight to Tami's mouth. She's listening.
I work for student loans. If the school is not going to work with you, if the school
does direct lending, contact the Department of Education. If not, find out who your lender
is and contact them. They can work with the school.
And Maren says, yes ma'am. Yes.
I will tell her that, well I'll tell you. Tomorrow I will send you an IM with the Department
of Education's 800 number. Maren says, yes ma'am. She's on that. Alright.
And FU to Rick for not straightening out issues with our whole department complex. Thanks
to him not correcting them. I'm being sued for rent for the last month we were there,
even though we weren't there the whole month. End rant, K thanks bye. Moving on. Dork would
like to say F you to counter strike for having so many hackers that can rip your freaking
head off from the starting point. F you to work for not letting me off early so I can
go home and listen to Orange Lounge Radio. I'm here today because I asked for off to
to go to a friend's birthday. F you to my car because I don't know what the fuck is
wrong with it. Now my chances of going to Mobile, Alabama for their tournament is slim.
F you to my saving habits. F you to my DDR permanent tacking because it all...
If there's a tournament next month, I'm going to be in Mobile next month.
Wow! That's my freakin' hometown. You need to cover the tournament in Mobile for us.
That's my freakin' hometown. I'll do it. You need to research that. Get in contact with
I'm actually in the chat room even though I'm technically not there because I'm logged
in at home.
Dr. Sakura, SSF, that's me, send me a PM with the details.
Dork, do that.
Okay.
Dork would also like to say F you to the Saints for losing again.
So what else is new?
Tao would like to say F you to my roommates for monopolizing the PS2 with Disgaea and
I'm gonna take you to GTA and my sacred FFTA from me, which if I remember, didn't he mooch that from somebody else? I believe so.
Alright. But anyway, would you like to respond, puppy?
No? Okay.
You know, I've had this horrible urge to play Parappa 2 lately.
Alright.
In all seriousness, he says, F you to, um, well shit, this was a good week for me, F you to not having much to bitch at.
No Stylin, stop parrying in the chat room.
Speaking of No Stylin, screw people that drive slow, F you for people that wear transparent shoes, F you for not having 40 cent days at McDonalds, F you to Comcast, F you to my car which has been dead for 3 months, F you to people that play Warcraft 3 all day and have nothing better to do, F you to expensive
better to do. F you to expensive Goosh paint? I don't know. What in the hell is that? Does
any artist here know what that is? G-H-O-U-C-E? Juice? Goosh? I don't know. I've never heard
of it. They come in these small 2.4 ounces and cost 6 to 9 dollars and they get used
up after a single project. Good job Sky and Jamie. On what? I don't know. She says good
cuz we rock
i don't know
okay i don't know you want to respond to uh... no silent
pdr mike would like to say
at future the drug mexican who showed me his dealing with
well mike if you hadn't looked so interested
dork says that the tournament is on november first in mobile alabama
tell him to private message me the details
because it's actually probably the day i'm flying in
and there's lots of typing going on
I'm relaying the message as she says, yes ma'am.
Alright, no but, if it's on the first then I likely can't attend because it's the day I'm planning on flying in unless I can fly in the day before.
So just give me details.
I need details, times, locations, is it at, you know, cyber station or what, let me know.
Alright, that's it for the FUs of the week.
Finally.
Oh, Erin would like to say something to you all?
Oh, Baka, I know you like PETA, but stop advertising it in the chat for the goddamn last time.
How many times does this say this parrot is dead?
Jeez.
Until I bring it back.
No Stylin says, GJ, that's good job, for Loki.
Don't know who he or she is.
No silence says, um, GJ for Loki. Don't know who he or she is.
Don't know who he or she is. It's alright. I don't care. I wasn't even paying attention.
I'm sitting here with a smile on his face and he's kind of shaking like, it's alright, I don't care. I don't care, I'm going to kill him, I don't care.

Go back to your chemistry homework.
Chemists suck...
Be a drug dealer.
That's like street chemistry for ya.
and it pays better anyways
you know canada is so cool
we should take a road trip there
i don't know it's like we're like the sixties and canada is the seventies
or what wait did the seventies suck
the seventies had disco
and remember your disco needs you
i don't know why canada rocks because they're going to start selling alcohol in movie theaters
i'm going
i am going
that's awesome. Drunk movie goers need to buy more popcorn so they can drink more
Oh, and if you do my work, give me Geely, which is sitting on top of my PS2 right there.
Hey, Zodiac Knight wants to share something with you. They actually made cocaine in his
organic lab. Don't you wish you went to his school, puppy?
Really? Yep. What a cool...
Why would I be making cocaine? Why not? It's fun and educational.
Alright, we're going to take a quick break. We're going to play two songs from the V-Rare
2CDUS. We're going to play Tomorrow Perfume and I Need You and then I'm throwing in K8107.
Oh, we'll do that. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So we'll do those second and third.
But in the meantime, if you guys enjoyed tonight's cage match winner, P8107, you might enjoy.
Look and tell them about it. K8107. Like I said, I don't even know who this 8107 shit
is, but K8107 is a remix of Karma. So, it's pretty cool. But anyway, it's also by OnoKen.
You can actually find it on his site if you search for OnoKen under muzi.co.jp, you can
find him on there. Anyways. Okay, after this break, we'll come back and I don't know what
we're going to do, but we might do some Ask Orange Lounge or something to finish up the
So, about 9 o'clock, so when we get back from break it'll be about 9.05, so maybe we'll
do some Ask Orange Lounge, because we have some new people listening tonight, we have
quite a few new people listening tonight, and they might have some questions they want
to ask, so we'll see when we come back. This is K8107.
And that's the end of the video, thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
...

The promise of love for the happiness I lose once or whenever I'm with you

I'm here to begin to love you
So believe, believe, believe
To me, to me, yeah
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Bongo the man did.
worse than confiscating.
this, he says UltraMix looks very cool, which I'm sure it already does, I could have told
you that, so we'll see about that. But one thing I was trying to tell him, I'd asked
him if he knew anything about Sony putting out a new competitive dancing game, and he
said he didn't. And I was like, oh, I gotta find this story about what was going on with
Sony putting out the competitive dancing game, and I found it! So hopefully he's listening
so I can get him all caught up on this story, so that's what I wanted to tell you guys about.
This story comes from gamesource.yahoo.com

with a little less conversation with no complicated controls I toy groove is
instantly accessible even for those with no rhythm so come on everybody let's get
down a groove what do you guys think
Gee, I like motion capture dance games because they rock.
It's stupid.
It's retarded and if you think people look awkward playing DDR, wait till you see this.
This is nothing.
I'm thinking, if it's some kind of camera that's capturing your motion, I'm thinking
this sounds a lot like Para to me.
Is it just me or does this sound like Para?
The reincarnation of Para.
And you said Para.
p0k3smot42o
25 songs, which will get old, about as fast as DDR Max 2 got old.
So, you know what, this will be good for those people who are like, oh, oh my god, it's Madonna!
Oh my god, I get this thing! Sign me up, that's me!
Sign me up, I'm going out and buying this thing. I want to dance to music. Hey, Mr. DJ.
What is that camera going to call you?
where executives sit in a large room, watch the images, and laugh at you.
Kick Andrew again, kick Andrew again!
Why do I get to kick Andrew again?
I'm sorry, that directive was not coming from Jamie, I can't do it in...
Okay, Jamie said to kick him.
And to respond to AZ and Buddy Paul, it's because all the idiots that started Para
Para decided to start drama over it and if it comes up again see even more job
and little is going oh no you didn't do their team right back that person you
that's why I need to die
all right as promised in this part of the show we'd like to take a minute to
let you take some control over the show and have us talk about any topic you
want us to in a segment that we call Ask Orange Lounge.
And you can send those questions now over private message
to Sky in the chat room.
In the meantime, let's hear the theme song.
["ASK ORANGE LOUNGE"]
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
What will we learn tonight on Ask Orange Lounge?
What is Loki mad about?
What is Dark Sakura mad about?
What is Sky mad about?
The answer is probably Aaron.
Just kidding.
All right.
Question number one is coming to us tonight from Baca.
And this is a good question.
This is my favorite question that's ever
been asked in Ask Orange Lounge.
He says, Baca says, why are you so cool, Skye?
Why?
Let's go over this long list of reasons that I have.
My response is another question, how many checks have you been taking tonight?
Just as cool.
Now now now.
I think more than enough to get a piece of the cock I would like to say because
face it everybody I mean we're in the 21st century now and everybody loves the
token gay guy right and not only that but I'm a token gay guy on the radio I'm
I'm the token black guy, so...
Loki consistently bringing this show to new lows.
Well, I don't know if you listen to half the people online who have never met me in person.
I'm the token Asian girl.
When the fact is that between Loki, Dark Sakura, and myself, we are like the whitest people
ever.
I don't know.
I mean, my last name is White Man.
Hello.
Yes, but you need a fake last name for the show, like Jamie and I have.
So I think your last name's going to be Black Man for the show.
You're going to be Matt Blackman.
Blackman.
Blackman.
Hey.
Principal Blackman.
Who wants to respond to Zodiac Night's comment, yay for token Asians?
Yay for token Asians.
Hooray.
I love Asian people.
I like everybody.
I like everybody for dinner.
Jamie says, I like everybody for dinner.
For 100 people, how would you vote 100 people?
All right.
Question number two tonight comes from AznBuddyPaul.
I already sent this in email.
Oh, I didn't even open the Orange Laundry Mail bag.
I may have to do that.
There's never anything in the Orange Laundry Mail bag.
But here it is.
AznBuddyPaul would like to know, why Sunday night for this show
I'm breaking rules staying up this late?
Well, when Orange Lounge Radio started, I was doing double work.
I was doing another show on Saturday night under Station Live, which is still on the
air because the host moved to Texas and has some new co-hosts now under stationlive.org.
That's on Saturday night, so it just kind of made sense to do a show on Sunday night
and that's what Jamie agreed to and that's what Matt started showing up to.
But there's always the rewinds.
Yes.
Thank you.
We keep switching them, Thursdays at 2 and Wednesdays at 4, Pacific Standard Time.
No more Mondays because that's when Vanilla Sky is on.
The reason why also, I learned from doing a radio show on Saturday night, although there
may be a lot of people at home who want to listen, that ruins my Saturday night.
I can't go out and go to places like Dave and Buster's and all that stuff if we're doing
show on Saturday, and my wife comes first, as I believe Jamie and Loki would agree to.
Oh, you have to answer 23rd Magus, he says I am the wise person ever.
Yeah, he's right. Yeah, he is right, he is the wise person ever. But, it is Friday, Saturday
night, while they might be good for ratings, we want to have a life, and if we don't go
out there and get a life, we'll have nothing to talk about on this program, so deal. Sorry.
But yes, if you don't like Sunday nights, you can't always listen to the rewinds.
And there's also original programming on Monday and Tuesday, and soon Wednesday again nights
as well.
So.
Yeah.
But thanks for asking.
Alright, 23rd Magus would like to ask, pink, purple, or teal?
What's the question?
I mean, why?
Pink, purple, or teal?
That's the question.
Purple.
Let me see if I can guess. What color should he dye his pubes? I would go with purple because
you know that might offset your hair or something. You look horrible. It would also confuse people
looking for a natural color. We already have a pink so maybe teal. You can be the artist
known as Teal. Alright, 23rd Magus would also like to ask, 23rd Magus would like to ask,
why do we have a gazillion ops in the chat room but very few are on consistently? My
answer to that is, quit op begging. You know, I think it has to do just because we cycle
in and out. We're all on at different times. Except for Puppy, who has no life. Angels
just being in the ass. I do.
Dork has a question for Jamie. What?
When are you going to be in Mobile? If I can get the time off of work, it's going to be the
1st through the 15th. Fair enough.
Next question. Greg is Massa.
Would like to know, what's for dinner? I wonder if he's asking what we had for dinner tonight.
How about Chef Aaron explains. He's asking me, because he's treated me out
before for food, so I kind of owe him dinner. Mystery meat!
Well, answer the question I asked. What did we have tonight? Tell that to our parents.
We had chopped up cabbage into strips with pork and, in Jamie's case, chicken because
she can't eat pork. And we had rice. Always a staple.
Yummy. It was very good. Puppy, do you have your hand up or are you
just dangling the ferret by its balls the ferrets have the ferrets are joined
like it for people who live in the south you'll recognize these like the little
love bugs who you say oh well they're joined that's so pretty they're fucking
it's like cat talk but it's ferret ferret
seriously the thing is is if you catch the two bugs together and make a wish
about the person you love and let them go then it's happy but all that you do
Q. Why do people start drama over games like Initial D?
A. People have no lives and have nothing else to do.
People at certain arcades just think it's fun because they have no lives so they think
in order to have a life you can start drama over other people's lives so everybody has
of life and everybody is drama. I think that these are people who use video games to validate
their sense of self-worth. Here is my 100% serious answer to this question. Any group
that you do participate in is going to have drama. You hear about theater drama or football
drama or whatever you're doing, there's drama. Because when you get people together, they've
We've got personality clashes of the ass going on, and there's drama.
So it doesn't matter.
And then Iso-D has drama just as bad as DDR, or any game.
Great, that's funny that you get your ass kicked by cats.
Alright, moving on.
Jonas, sorry.
Do we people exist, so what to expect?
Fair enough.
Evil Naoki 2DX would also like to know, may I call you, this will be a question towards
me, may I call you Robbie Puns from now on, or Robbie Pums, no you may not, but you may
call me Sexy Rob, that is permissible, or the Pharaoh King, yes, why is it, another
question from Evil Naoki 2DX, why is it that PT Cruisers follow me around whenever I am
outdoors?
I don't know, are you just attracting things that suck lately?
They want to tap your ass.
23rd Magus would like to say, he'd like to clarify the pink, purple, and teal question.
That was the M&M's poll, you dumbass.
I would also like to say the M&M's poll ended about six months ago, you dumbass.
Is that like a little anecdote in his five page joke book?
I believe so, it's the foreword, it's the epilogue.
It's the fifth page.
Dork would like to say,
tournament will be all day, just come whenever you come in, chances are we'll still be there, the November 1st thing.
Tell them you may have a special guest then.
Zodiac Knight has a question.
1. Dark Sakura, will you marry me?
You'd have to go against Dan and Dan is six foot four.
I think that if he stepped on you, you'd be dead.
So no.
Yeah, in fact, tax my other man and then there's my mistress,
Margaret Cho.
Okay, well, he said he had a backup plan here.
He says, if not, question two, Sky, will you marry me?
Are you 18?
Because I hate it when 17 year olds ask me this question.
I hate it.
I could, but I love him too much to kick him.
EvilMauki2Dx has a question for DarkSapper.
Why don't you let him shoot 23 Magus instead?
Alright, I'll kick, you know what, that's right, what I will do, I will kick 23 Magus instead of kicking EvilMauki2Dx.
They made the scapegoat.
There, that was easy.
Alright.
That was beautiful.
Alright.
Do it again.
I want a re-run.
You want a re-run?
Yeah.
Let's syndicate this.
It's the kicking 23 Megas the show.
Alright.
Alright.
That's enough abuse.
Okay.
No more abusing the freshman, you guys.
Fresh meat.
Any more?
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
question
here is
you know now if you do you have a question for dark sacra yes when you
coming to san francisco again
you know
when someone pays
for me to get to san francisco
i don't know i i want i actually want to go
on a saturday but i'm still dan and i are right completely redoing our
apartment you know throwing out crap and stuff but maybe when I get back from
from Alabama I might set out a special Saturday if I'm not sick from all the
uber thick cigarette smoke
yes yes 23rd Vegas you are a target you know big bright red bullseye painted on
your ass big white target with the bright red bullseye painted on your ass
to sell white. Oh, so that means that I can go to him to buy my deodorant. Alright. Never
mind, I'll go to Walmart. 23rd Magus says, will you have extra medical supplies tomorrow?
You'll need them. He's directing that towards me because he's coming. He wants to guest
on Vanilla Sky tomorrow because he believes that he can play a video game trivia to bad
music and keep the volume at five percent. He's challenging me to own him at a video
game trivia to bad music so we shall see I don't know Brad had it Brad kept it at
only 15% last week while a rice princess went to 65 huh well why don't you want
to put your money where your mouth is I know sheets on my bed tomorrow you know
you could come clean up my bedroom if you want I don't I don't really want to
Okay, then.
My sheets smell like Shermy's butt right now because she slept on my bed.
Okay, so I think now's a good time for us to close up the old mailbag for Ask Orange
a lot.
Oh, wait.
Actually, I should check the email bag real fast.
In the meantime-
Have you deleted the spam?
Hello?
Will Jamie please entertain us with a song and dance while I open up the mailbag?
I'm never asking her to do this again.
And that was the horrendous sexual acts of two stuffed ferrets with a little voice box
inside of them.
The email box is orangelaungeradio.com all one word orangelaungeradio yahoo.com
We just got that same question from Paul that says,
why are the shows on Sunday?
Sunday night, people have to get ready to go back
to school or work.
Did we get any questions asking if we wanted enlarged penises?
In the mailbox, no.
Damn it, I've always wanted a larger penis.
For those people who didn't see it before, there's the pad.
kostjamrh There's the pad, number one finished.
kostjamrh There it is, no it's not bent, it's just a camera lens.
kostjamrh I don't know if you can see that on the web cam right now.
How many things are built out of wood out here we're going to close up the ask orange lounge mailbag now
That's all we've got to say this week on ask orange lounge we hope you learned something tonight on orange lounge radio
Who was the biggest bitch send your votes right now?
now. Just kidding. Just kidding. If you vote, you'll get kicked. All right. All right. Yes.
Okay, so it's about time to wrap up the show, you guys.
Wrap it up in ribbons and bows. Wrap it up in ribbons and bows. Wrap it up
in straps and buckles. Before we put the lid on the coffin of the
show, we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, so let's start off with Aaron,
violent hyper girl.
Drama sucks, Para is not meant for community, the end.
Jonas, final thought.
Well, I forgot to mention this before, I was thinking about running a tournament in January,
Book for January
So if anyone wants to contact me about this tournament, just go to grfreak.com or the visionaries forum
Yep
Fuck it's just good. I'm just just good. Okay. I am I just
Or just email me that's all or go to that site you heard earlier
Well, I'm online like 24 7 so I am me at silly fobby girl. G URL
Bobby is F-O-B-B-Y, and then I'll just forward it to Jonas, because occasionally you're online, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, occasionally he's online, so, yeah.
Bradley, your final thought, please.
I so hope I get a job soon, soon, ah, the doom is closing in.
Puppy, your final thought?
Chemistry sucks.
The end.
All right.
Well put.
Who hasn't gone yet?
Just the three of us?
Loki.
Remember, for all you trainables out there, it's the middle hole.
My final thought is stay tuned for the afterbirth tonight.
It's going to be great.
My final thought is I need some money and I need a maid to clean my house for me.
I need a house, a big one.
I need a compound.
I want a castle with a moat.
We need to have our own gated community.
I like that idea.
The orange line's gated community.
Oh yeah, that link posted is wrong because Jonah screwed up.
Game J, er, G-A-M-E, not N-E.
Alright, thank you.
Uh, final word of the show tonight will go to...
Whoa, I don't think Puppy's ever had it, so let's give it to Puppy.
No menclature.
I don't have the outro queued up.
Hold on, you get a second shot at it because I didn't have the outro queued up, I was lazy.
Oh, okay.
Sorry.
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki.
We expect you a nice play again.
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
Well, here I am in my tubby again, and my tubby's all filled with water and nice fluffy
suds.
And I've got my soap and washcloth to wash myself, and I've got my nifty scrub brush
to help me scrub my back, and I've got a big fluffy towel to dry myself when I'm done.
But there's one other thing that makes tubby time the very best time of the whole day.
And do you know what that is?
He's a very special friend of mine, my very favorite little pal.
Oh, Rubber Ducky, you're the one You make bath time lots of fun
Rubber Ducky, I'm awfully fond of you
Bobo, Bodeo, Rubber Ducky, joy of joy When I squeeze you, you make noise

Rub-a-dub-dubby, Rubber Ducky, you're so fine, and I'm lucky that you're mine.
Rubber Ducky, I'm awfully fond of you.
Hey Rubber Ducky, would you like me to scrub your back with my nifty little scrub brush?
You would? Okay, how's this?
Hey, you want me to scrub behind your ears?
Oh, I see, you don't have any ears, do you?
Well, how about your tummy?
