WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
That changed and I just wonder why

00:05.000 --> 00:12.000
All it took was just one smile

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Now with you

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Out of the blue

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Lover here

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Before my eyes

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
With you

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Think I'm true

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
I never thought I'd

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
Realize what love

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
What love was, what love was, what love was

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
I need you, oh I need you every day

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
I love you more and more without you

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
I know what is so strong

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
Suddenly, I see you there, and everything's okay

00:58.000 --> 01:05.000
You're the one, I feel this way

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
Now it's you, out of the blue

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Love appears before my eyes

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
It's you, dream come true

01:17.000 --> 01:28.000
I never thought I'd bring you a life of love, of love, of love

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
Here with you

01:32.000 --> 01:48.000
We are together now.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Never take my heart away.

01:52.000 --> 02:01.000
All the love that fell is here to stay.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Woah, woah, woah

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
It's like a dream come true

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
I never thought I'd fall in love with you

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
Love appears before my eyes with you

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
It comes true

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
I never thought I'd be with you

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
Out of the, out of the, out of the, out of the city blue

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
Oh, it's like a dream come true

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
I never thought, I never thought

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
Out of the blue

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
You brought my eyes with you

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Dream come true

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
I never thought I'd fall in love with you

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
Out of the, out of the, out of the, out of the league

03:03.000 --> 03:32.000
We are young, hotted, we stand, no promises, no demands, no demands, no promises, no demands.

04:02.000 --> 04:23.000
You make me go, then make me stay Why do you hurt me so bad?

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
You would help me to know, do I stand in your wake?

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Or am I the best thing you can?

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
Believe me, believe me, I can't tell you why

04:39.000 --> 04:46.000
But I'm trapped by your love and I'm chained to your lies

04:46.000 --> 05:06.000
We are young, heartache, heartache, we stand No promises for demand, love is a fantasy

05:06.000 --> 05:23.000
We are young, no one can tell us where to run Searching our hearts for solo love

05:23.000 --> 05:32.000
Both of us knowing, love is of seven feet

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
We're meant to control, we turn it away

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Hold on to me deep inside

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
And if all this gets old, will it still feel the same?

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
There's no way this will die

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
But if we get much closer, I still lose control

06:03.000 --> 06:10.000
And if your heart's a grandeur, you'll need me too, oh

06:10.000 --> 06:30.640
We are young, heartache, heartache, we stand No promises, no delays, love is as good as

06:30.640 --> 06:47.640
We are strong, no one can tell us where to run Searching our hearts for some love

06:47.640 --> 06:57.640
For the first knowing, love is a battle for you

07:17.640 --> 07:32.160
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

07:32.160 --> 07:38.120
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk and then some.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.680
Mostly the and then some part of that.

07:40.680 --> 07:45.320
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

07:45.320 --> 07:50.320
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

07:50.320 --> 07:54.320
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge radio.

07:54.320 --> 07:56.320
Yes, I will spank your child.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.320
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.320
Well, here's to my big opening.

08:05.320 --> 08:07.320
A sphincter says what?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.320
I'm super. Thanks for asking.

08:09.320 --> 08:12.320
Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

08:12.320 --> 08:14.320
What am I doing here?

08:14.320 --> 08:15.320
Awwww.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.320
Dodge this.

08:16.320 --> 08:17.320
Mmhmm.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.320
This is a tasty burger.

08:19.320 --> 08:22.320
Look you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.

08:22.320 --> 08:23.320
Yes I have.

08:23.320 --> 08:24.320
Look!

08:24.320 --> 08:25.320
It's a flesh wound.

08:25.320 --> 08:28.320
Searching for a boy in high school isn't useless.

08:28.320 --> 08:32.320
It's searching for meaning in a polyshorn way.

08:32.320 --> 08:33.320
Oh yeah?

08:33.320 --> 08:37.320
Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

08:37.320 --> 08:38.320
Dark Sakura.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.320
I've got a sniff.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.320
Sky.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.320
But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

08:42.320 --> 08:43.320
Loki.

08:43.320 --> 09:12.320
We are live and this is episode number 66.

09:12.320 --> 09:35.320
I don't have much of a voice left, that's why I will be speaking in spirit all evening.

09:35.320 --> 09:36.320
No.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.320
No.

09:37.320 --> 09:40.720
How are you feeling this week?

09:40.720 --> 09:52.840
last week better okay in that corner say hello to our tech massa Loki hi also

09:52.840 --> 09:59.920
with us tonight we have the one and only Arcadian 42 you know and that's it it's

09:59.920 --> 10:06.280
a small it's a small little studio tonight but that's okay who is the other

10:06.280 --> 10:07.280
special guest, dare I ask?

10:07.280 --> 10:08.280
The other special guest is my laundry.

10:08.280 --> 10:09.280
I think it's the webcam.

10:09.280 --> 10:15.560
Which smells Mountain Spring fresh at this very moment.

10:15.560 --> 10:19.520
Actually, it smells like Tide.

10:19.520 --> 10:25.080
My fabric softener smells like Gain, so it smells like Tide Gain bounce.

10:25.080 --> 10:28.440
Gain makes me think of the Gator network, which makes me cry.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.480
That makes everybody cry.

10:30.480 --> 10:36.040
Of course, we have something that is now even worse than Gator.

10:36.040 --> 10:40.440
something out there. There's a software for your computer. It is worse than Gator. It

10:40.440 --> 10:46.440
is worse than Bonsai Buddy. It is worse than Gator with a Bonsai Buddy. It's the worst

10:46.440 --> 10:51.440
damn software you could ever have on your computer. And we'll be talking about that

10:51.440 --> 10:52.440
later.

10:52.440 --> 10:53.440
Okay.

10:53.440 --> 10:56.840
But first we're going to take a quick break. We have all sorts of news tonight. How was

10:56.840 --> 11:01.680
your week? How was your day? An exciting DDR story which aired on our local news, which

11:01.680 --> 11:07.120
definitely have to play and make fun of for you all. Another game coming out soon. Could

11:07.120 --> 11:12.600
this be the DDR Killer? We'll see. And Sacramento has a DDR machine in a very odd location all

11:12.600 --> 11:13.600
coming up after this.

11:13.600 --> 11:42.300
So one, two, three...

11:42.300 --> 11:44.300
Oh

12:12.300 --> 12:14.300
I know

13:14.300 --> 13:26.300
I can't, but I can't help falling in love with you

13:26.300 --> 13:34.300
Shall I say, will I say, see, I will say

13:34.300 --> 13:44.300
If I can't help falling in love with you

13:44.300 --> 14:13.300
It's like a river flow, flowing through the sea, flowing through the valley, like hell, something's about to be.

14:13.300 --> 14:22.300
Take my hand, take my whole life through

14:22.300 --> 14:35.300
I can't help falling in love with you

15:52.300 --> 16:21.920

16:31.920 --> 16:35.220
There's a whole shitload of people there tonight.

16:35.220 --> 16:39.600
Just waiting to talk to you and tell you where our webcam's at if you want to stare at us,

16:39.600 --> 16:45.560
although Jamie never is on cam because- And remember, $2.99 a minute, you know, you

16:45.560 --> 16:46.560
could...

16:46.560 --> 16:47.560
We might have talked to you in other ways.

16:47.560 --> 16:48.560
I don't know.

16:48.560 --> 16:59.800
I charge for my P.M. That's the only way you can vote in the cage match and also send your

16:59.800 --> 17:03.560
nephews of the week and all that stuff.

17:03.560 --> 17:08.420
So hello.

17:08.420 --> 17:11.480
So for those of you guys that listen to the show on a regular basis, I'm sure you've heard

17:11.480 --> 17:17.480
Loki in the past talk about his experiences when he goes to Raley's to get Chinese food.

17:17.480 --> 17:23.640
And the lady that works at the Raley's department that always says, you want a sample?

17:23.640 --> 17:27.040
Yes, the sample lady at the Raley's.

17:27.040 --> 17:34.000
And I had the chance today, Loki and I went down to Walmart today to run some errands

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
and do something else.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.660
So we're going to talk about much later in the show.

17:37.660 --> 17:41.040
We went to Walmart and then we went over to Raley's to get some dinner, because I was

17:41.040 --> 17:42.600
going to get some Chinese food.

17:42.600 --> 17:45.760
And Loki said, hey, this is the Raley's where the sample lady works at.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.960
I was all excited, because I didn't realize that we were going to the Raley's, where the

17:48.960 --> 17:51.320
sample lady works at, because I always thought she worked at another one.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.620
Raley's, for those who don't know, because I forget, it's probably only in California.

17:54.620 --> 17:58.400
It's a big grocery store chain, so Raley's is a big grocery store.

17:58.400 --> 18:02.400
This is the most fucked up Raley's I've ever seen, this Raley's here in Folsom, where we

18:02.400 --> 18:03.400
live.

18:03.400 --> 18:07.300
We have the Rainbow Cafe, first of all, when you walk right in the door.

18:07.300 --> 18:12.560
The Rainbow Cafe, it sounds like something that belongs in Lavender Heights in Midtown.

18:12.560 --> 18:16.480
So you have the Rainbow Cafe when you walk through the door, and right next to the Rainbow

18:16.480 --> 18:22.040
Cafe is the takeout place, the hot walk.

18:22.040 --> 18:26.520
So Loki and I walk in, and Loki's like, oh my God, the sample lady's working today.

18:26.520 --> 18:27.520
That's her.

18:27.520 --> 18:28.520
That's her.

18:28.520 --> 18:29.520
So I got all excited because I saw the sample lady.

18:29.520 --> 18:32.720
And of course, since I saw the sample lady, there was nothing I wanted more than to hear

18:32.720 --> 18:36.280
her go, you want a sample?

18:36.280 --> 18:37.280
Yes.

18:37.280 --> 18:41.680
So Loki gets up there and ordered his food, and shockingly enough, she didn't say it.

18:41.680 --> 18:42.640
She didn't say it to him.

18:42.640 --> 18:45.600
So I was starting to get a lot upset because I'm like, I can't be here and

18:45.600 --> 18:47.360
not hear the you want sample thing.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.840
So I went up there and I was like, hi, yeah,

18:50.840 --> 18:53.000
can I try a little bit of the garlic chicken?

18:53.000 --> 18:55.200
You know, it's trying to go out, oh, you want sample?

18:55.200 --> 18:56.040
It didn't work.

18:56.040 --> 18:56.960
She didn't say anything.

18:56.960 --> 19:00.760
She just kind of gave it to me and then got my meal and we were gone.

19:00.760 --> 19:03.560
But there was this really stupid guy that was there too.

19:03.560 --> 19:07.800
And after I took my garlic chicken and I ate the little thing because they put it

19:07.800 --> 19:09.560
on a toothpick, they put a piece on a toothpick, so you need it.

19:09.560 --> 19:13.300
He's like, so was it good?

19:13.300 --> 19:17.220
I'm just like, fuck off.

19:17.220 --> 19:18.260
Yes, it was delicious.

19:18.260 --> 19:20.860
Do you want me to spit it back out so you can taste it too?

19:20.860 --> 19:23.700
I mean, fucking ask for yourself and find out for yourself.

19:23.700 --> 19:25.820
Because what I think is really good tasting,

19:25.820 --> 19:27.180
you might fucking hate.

19:27.180 --> 19:30.140
So I actually can stand to drink diet soda.

19:30.140 --> 19:32.220
A lot of people think I'm fucking weird.

19:32.220 --> 19:32.980
Rob.

19:32.980 --> 19:33.940
Yes?

19:33.940 --> 19:36.220
People don't think that you're weird.

19:36.220 --> 19:37.380
Eat me.

19:37.380 --> 19:40.180
Anyway, so I didn't get to hear the you want sample thing.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.300
And then the lady who was checking us out,

19:42.300 --> 19:44.340
she looked like a brunette Donatella Versace,

19:44.340 --> 19:46.060
which kind of scared me a little bit.

19:46.060 --> 19:50.940
Oh my god, that woman is hideous looking.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.420
She looks like droopy.

19:53.420 --> 19:57.620
Welcome to Donatella Versace's Halloween party.

19:57.620 --> 19:59.500
I give you candy, cigarettes.

19:59.500 --> 20:02.100
Here's some candy, here's some cigarettes.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.020
God, I love when they impersonate Donatella Versace

20:04.020 --> 20:05.060
on Saturday Night Live.

20:05.060 --> 20:07.100
Anyway, so the lady who checked us out

20:07.100 --> 20:13.600
There were these two kids that were trying to play in one of those power wheelchairs.

20:13.600 --> 20:17.140
You know how if you're handicapped and you go to the grocery store, they give you a complimentary

20:17.140 --> 20:18.140
wheelchair to sit in?

20:18.140 --> 20:19.140
What a complimentary wheelchair.

20:19.140 --> 20:23.300
There were these kids, and I swear to God, they were about ready to ram right into all

20:23.300 --> 20:24.300
the candy.

20:24.300 --> 20:25.300
It was funny.

20:25.300 --> 20:28.820
But I'm really upset because I didn't get to hear the you want sample thing, so I just

20:28.820 --> 20:31.820
have to rely on Loki.

20:31.820 --> 20:33.820
Loki is the only one that can do it.

20:33.820 --> 20:38.940
And then he had to go, I'm trying to train her not to offer the samples, because she

20:38.940 --> 20:41.020
does it at the wrong times.

20:41.020 --> 20:45.260
You already get your food, she's already given it to you, it's all ready to go.

20:45.260 --> 20:49.380
I got sweet and sour pork, and she'll give me a sample of sweet and sour pork like, gee,

20:49.380 --> 20:51.700
I didn't know what it tasted like.

20:51.700 --> 20:54.140
Oh my God, that's so good, maybe I should get some.

20:54.140 --> 20:57.020
Oh wait, I already did.

20:57.020 --> 20:58.020
She's so retarded.

20:58.020 --> 21:03.380
And then on Friday, they had a person that was even dumber than she was, this old guy,

21:03.380 --> 21:05.180
He was like, oh, you want food?

21:05.180 --> 21:06.540
You want Chinese?

21:06.540 --> 21:08.100
What kind of rice do you want?

21:08.100 --> 21:10.860
And it's like so fucking annoying.

21:10.860 --> 21:12.500
They're so slow.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.180
They're like operating in another dimension.

21:15.180 --> 21:16.420
They operate in the process.

21:16.420 --> 21:18.540
Freaking old.

21:18.540 --> 21:21.220
But yeah, they sucked.

21:21.220 --> 21:23.420
And then Rob had to go and ask for a sample and actually

21:23.420 --> 21:25.460
thinks it's OK to ask for samples.

21:25.460 --> 21:27.660
And then she went back to asking people for samples.

21:27.660 --> 21:29.980
God damn it.

21:29.980 --> 21:31.940
You messed it all up for me.

21:31.940 --> 21:34.940
I swear to God, she recognized you when we walked in there.

21:34.940 --> 21:39.140
We walked in and she looked at you with that, hi, look on her face.

21:39.140 --> 21:42.900
I was kind of like, oh, she recognizes Loki as a frequent customer.

21:42.900 --> 21:48.500
But what was so weird is right before you went up there to get helped, she started staring

21:48.500 --> 21:49.700
off into space.

21:49.700 --> 21:52.260
She was staring at some person on the other end of the store.

21:52.260 --> 21:55.820
And mind you, there's a line of five people there waiting at the counter.

21:55.820 --> 21:57.100
She's looking at her ancestors.

21:57.100 --> 21:59.660
She's staring off into space, yeah.

21:59.660 --> 22:06.200
seeing the ghost of Christmas past in front of her or something. It's fucking crazy.

22:06.200 --> 22:10.600
But the woman's entertaining, so I'll continue to patronize that really. If for nothing else,

22:10.600 --> 22:12.560
then good stories to fill up time on Orange Laundry Radio.

22:12.560 --> 22:20.520
I have plenty of things I could patronize. In a completely different sense.

22:20.520 --> 22:24.240
Let's start off the lovely show with How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, our favorite

22:24.240 --> 22:30.360
way of letting you know what's going on in our lives. It sounds like Jamie wants to start.

22:30.360 --> 22:34.920
Oh God, that gives me a headache. Jamie, how was your past two weeks in your day? You were

22:34.920 --> 22:40.560
out last week for sickness. Oh my God, Thursday. Wait, how long have you been sick now? Like

22:40.560 --> 22:47.320
three weeks? No. Do you have SARS? No. No, I started to get sick around Wednesday-ish

22:47.320 --> 22:52.680
and Thursday. Dan's like, hey, let's go out and have dinner and shit. And so I'm like,

22:52.680 --> 22:53.180
Okay.

22:53.180 --> 22:54.360
Wait, you had dinner and shit?

22:54.500 --> 22:55.140
Shut up.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.860
Everything makes you shit.

22:57.940 --> 22:58.380
Anyway.

22:58.640 --> 22:59.140
Not soup.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.360
With my digestion.

23:05.360 --> 23:05.820
Anyway.

23:05.820 --> 23:06.320
All right.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.920
It could be like chunky, creamy cheese soup or something.

23:09.920 --> 23:10.600
Moving on.

23:11.880 --> 23:12.400
Anyway.

23:16.400 --> 23:16.920
I'm sorry.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.800
Could you repeat that revelation for our listeners?

23:18.800 --> 23:22.800
The beef soup makes your urine smell like beef.

23:22.800 --> 23:26.800
If you go around and smell it, it's a fact. It's just like honey smacks.

23:26.800 --> 23:30.800
Honey smacks makes your urine smell like honey smacks.

23:30.800 --> 23:34.800
It's quite fascinating.

23:34.800 --> 23:38.800
Honeycomb, honeycomb, we want honeycomb.

23:38.800 --> 23:42.800
Honeycomb doesn't do anything. It's just honey smacks

23:42.800 --> 23:46.800
and beef soup. I don't know.

23:46.800 --> 23:49.560
The blue wine punch makes your urine green.

23:49.560 --> 23:51.560
It's kind of weird.

23:51.560 --> 23:56.520
So if you were to eat beef sloop with honey smacks on the side, would your urine turn

23:56.520 --> 23:58.320
into this sudden stink bomb?

23:58.320 --> 24:02.280
You could just whip it out and pow.

24:02.280 --> 24:05.160
Hey, what about my week?

24:05.160 --> 24:06.160
Sorry.

24:06.160 --> 24:09.160
Okay, freaking piss sniffers.

24:09.160 --> 24:10.160
Okay.

24:10.160 --> 24:19.640
Okay, maybe it's different for a woman because you sit when you pee so you don't really smell

24:19.640 --> 24:21.780
it because it's kind of contained in the potty, right?

24:21.780 --> 24:22.780
The smell is right.

24:22.780 --> 24:30.040
But when you're a guy, you're whipping it out and you pee right there and what?

24:30.040 --> 24:34.480
I'm just saying, I'm just saying, you can't help it.

24:34.480 --> 24:35.480
What?

24:35.480 --> 24:41.520
I seriously think that's why some guys sit when they pee.

24:41.520 --> 24:42.520
Okay.

24:42.520 --> 24:47.360
Everyone here in the studio does have their pants on.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.440
I don't know what the hell they're talking about.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.000
We can fix that.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.640
Hey now, what the hell is that big black stitch?

24:53.640 --> 24:54.640
I don't know.

24:54.640 --> 24:56.520
Bradley sort of looks like he's not wearing pants in the webcam.

24:56.520 --> 24:58.600
Oh, your head's in the camp.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.600
Sorry, Jamie.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.600
You okay?

25:01.600 --> 25:07.080
You sure you want to talk about your week here?

25:07.080 --> 25:08.080
Okay.

25:08.080 --> 25:11.080
Do you want something to drink?

25:11.080 --> 25:15.440
You want some honey smacks?

25:15.440 --> 25:18.760
I had beef soup, but now all I have is chicken soup.

25:18.760 --> 25:19.760
Okay.

25:19.760 --> 25:25.520
Fucking go in the bathroom and take a pee right now, because I'm sick of hearing about

25:25.520 --> 25:26.520
your urine.

25:26.520 --> 25:27.520
Okay?

25:27.520 --> 25:28.520
Okay?

25:28.520 --> 25:37.400
Okay, if you have to pee, stop talking about it, just get in the bathroom and pee.

25:37.400 --> 25:41.000
We have so many Jamie quotes in like the past like two minutes right there to use in the

25:41.000 --> 25:43.760
next intro.

25:43.760 --> 25:46.800
Not to mention that the blue light punch turns your stool green also.

25:46.800 --> 25:51.680
You are in the perfect position for me to just knock you right out of your chair.

25:51.680 --> 25:52.680
Actually that would be my chair.

25:52.680 --> 25:55.840
Knock you right out of Logie's chair.

25:55.840 --> 26:00.840
I could throw the ferret at you, but that's too much effort.

26:00.840 --> 26:01.840
How was your week?

26:01.840 --> 26:02.840
How was your day?

26:02.840 --> 26:03.840
Two weeks.

26:03.840 --> 26:09.920
I was sick the whole time.

26:09.920 --> 26:15.040
I guess as everyone can tell, I still have this nasty cough.

26:15.040 --> 26:20.280
Last week, when I called in, as you can probably vouch for this, I sounded really shitty.

26:20.280 --> 26:22.520
I was getting dizzy in my chair.

26:22.520 --> 26:26.600
I ran fever all weekend, I ran fever at work, but it's nothing that's like super contagious

26:26.600 --> 26:29.520
it's a sinus infection.

26:29.520 --> 26:34.460
But I didn't know that time I thought that I had like leukemia and emphysema at the same

26:34.460 --> 26:35.460
time.

26:35.460 --> 26:40.320
No, Dan thought I had emphysema, that was funny, he's like, he was mistaking emphysema

26:40.320 --> 26:42.920
for bronchitis.

26:42.920 --> 26:44.640
Isn't emphysema something smokers get?

26:44.640 --> 26:45.640
Yeah.

26:45.640 --> 26:46.840
And you quit quite some years ago, didn't you?

26:46.840 --> 26:47.840
Like five and a half years ago.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.840
Yeah, so that's weird.

26:49.840 --> 27:01.880
Anyway, so all the snot in my nose that's been consistently draining since I had this

27:01.880 --> 27:07.560
infection start has been going right into my lungs, and then I've been, of course, coughing

27:07.560 --> 27:08.560
it all back up.

27:08.560 --> 27:16.840
I sound like I'm going to die every moment, and then I got over all the nasty fever, shakes,

27:16.840 --> 27:21.640
those symptoms, but I cough myself into headaches now, which sucks.

27:21.640 --> 27:25.000
I have a headache right now.

27:25.000 --> 27:30.480
It got bad enough that Tuesday when I was doing laundry, I stopped breathing for a little

27:30.480 --> 27:31.480
bit.

27:31.480 --> 27:32.480
I had to go lay down.

27:32.480 --> 27:40.720
I took three puffs off my Ibuterol, laid down, and it felt better finishing my laundry, but

27:40.720 --> 27:42.720
I called the doctor the next day.

27:42.720 --> 27:45.720
They gave me more asthma medicine that night.

27:45.720 --> 27:49.200
And then they said, I get a call the next day that says, either come into the doctor

27:49.200 --> 27:51.600
or if we can't schedule you, go to the emergency room.

27:51.600 --> 27:55.640
So I was like, okay, oh shit, that's like pretty, pretty bad.

27:55.640 --> 28:02.600
So I went to the doctor, turns out I had sinus infection, drainage.

28:02.600 --> 28:05.040
And then they prescribed me more drugs.

28:05.040 --> 28:10.120
So now I'm on an antibiotic and I'm on Robitussin with codeine.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.440
Robitussin, Robitussin.

28:11.440 --> 28:20.960
I swear at night, okay, you know me and my insane tolerance for alcohol, coding will

28:20.960 --> 28:25.700
just totally screw my head up, so I take it before bed and I'm really groggy when I wake

28:25.700 --> 28:30.160
up in the morning and dizzy and all kinds of fun stuff, so I'm on all kinds of drugs

28:30.160 --> 28:31.160
now.

28:31.160 --> 28:36.360
On top of that, my voice sounds really crappy and I work in a call center, so I'm hoping

28:36.360 --> 28:44.000
that I get over this crap before I go to Alabama. That's next Tuesday. I'm going to be on a

28:44.000 --> 28:53.560
plane next Tuesday. Anyway, so that's also why I sound really crappy. I'm about to spew

28:53.560 --> 29:01.440
up one of my lungs on your carpet so you can put it on the webcam.

29:01.440 --> 29:06.980
All right. Well, feel better soon. I mean, that kind of sucks that you have to go back

29:06.980 --> 29:11.280
to work tomorrow and talk, but on the bright side, maybe, you know, it'll build something

29:11.280 --> 29:21.120
up, the talking. I don't know how that works. You have no idea how gross it is. I can kind

29:21.120 --> 29:25.640
of imagine because I know that, you know, as somebody in my position, I have to talk

29:25.640 --> 29:30.360
a lot of times all day long too when I'm teaching. I talk loud too because I'm teaching. And

29:30.360 --> 29:36.320
And usually if I go for a while, like if we're in between classes and I'm not talking a lot

29:36.320 --> 29:39.840
loud and it takes me a little while, those first couple days when I get back in a class,

29:39.840 --> 29:49.960
where I have to kind of build up my voice again, so cough, cough, cough.

29:49.960 --> 29:55.200
Don't talk to me about actually coughing up everything, it's really gross.

29:55.200 --> 29:59.000
Luckily I haven't had to go through being sick and trying to do all that yet, but who

29:59.000 --> 30:07.200
who knows, maybe someday. Okay, so let's move on. Let's talk to Bradley. Bradley, how was

30:07.200 --> 30:10.320
your day and how was your week? And I think I'm sitting on the cord. Sorry, we'll give

30:10.320 --> 30:19.600
you a little more room there. My bad. That's as long as you're going to get to go. Oh,

30:19.600 --> 30:27.240
I have the wrong one. There we go. Now it's all untangled. Well, this week not too much

30:27.240 --> 30:33.800
happened. Sat around most of the day doing not much. Actually, I shipped out 20 or so

30:33.800 --> 30:44.100
packages to various places in the U.S. and six other countries. On Tuesday, I finally

30:44.100 --> 30:52.040
went by Fireside Lanes, which is like a mile from where I live. Went and checked out their

30:52.040 --> 30:56.680
DDR Extreme, and it's in pretty good shape, so I played two games then, then went back

30:56.680 --> 31:07.040
on Thursday and played six, and now my foot hurts from all that stomping. Let's see what

31:07.040 --> 31:16.520
else. And yesterday I fixed up my 2DX controller a bit, so I can actually play some 2DX the

31:16.520 --> 31:19.400
first time at home for the first time in like two months.

31:19.400 --> 31:22.760
God, I haven't played 2DX at home in a long time.

31:22.760 --> 31:27.560
I'm really hoping that, well, I mean, maybe we'll talk about it later, but I'm just hoping

31:27.560 --> 31:29.760
that there is, in fact, a new consumer style coming out.

31:29.760 --> 31:33.000
And yes, I know they've got all the signatures, and da-da-da-da-da, we'll address it later.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.440
I just really hope it happens and they don't try to dick us somehow.

31:36.440 --> 31:37.440
Yeah.

31:37.440 --> 31:43.880
It better not suck, too, considering we've had to wait like a year and a half at least,

31:43.880 --> 31:44.880
if not two years.

31:44.880 --> 31:48.040
Probably going to have to wait two years for this new 2DX, basically, from the time we

31:48.040 --> 31:49.040
got the last one.

31:49.040 --> 31:55.440
If it sucks, Konami can, like, just go to hell. I don't know.

31:55.440 --> 32:00.900
It better be good. It better have, like, 300 songs on it. Sorry.

32:00.900 --> 32:03.000
Well, hang on.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.940
And then, let's see, what else?

32:06.940 --> 32:15.540
If anything happened, not really much else happened.

32:15.540 --> 32:23.700
more 2DX a day and passed a few new things that was like played a few courses and passed

32:23.700 --> 32:32.580
a few new ones. That's about everything that happened this week. Alright, on to someone

32:32.580 --> 32:33.580
else.

32:33.580 --> 32:39.740
Loki, how was your day? How was your week?

32:39.740 --> 32:44.940
I didn't do anything today except for work on my cabinet a little bit and it's come along

32:44.940 --> 32:50.400
quite well. I'm on my last sheet of stuff to cut out, and the only thing that's holding

32:50.400 --> 32:56.120
me back is the damn battery power in the jigsaw. I mean, otherwise I would have been done today,

32:56.120 --> 33:03.240
but yeah, once it's all cut out, which will be this week, I will start putting it together.

33:03.240 --> 33:11.040
And then comes the wonderful job of finding out where we're going to put it. Yeah. No,

33:11.040 --> 33:16.040
Anyways, earlier this week, I said we'd just get rid of the couch.

33:16.040 --> 33:21.840
Well, I mean, what I was thinking is that we move that small chair somewhere, put the

33:21.840 --> 33:27.200
couch against the window, put the cabinet where her chair is, because obviously the

33:27.200 --> 33:30.920
... You okay?

33:30.920 --> 33:32.220
Okay.

33:32.220 --> 33:37.840
Obviously the camera would be on top of the cabinet sitting somewhere, and then, I don't

33:37.840 --> 33:40.000
I don't know, we'll figure out where to put the other chairs.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.140
Maybe burn that or something.

33:43.140 --> 33:44.260
I'll figure it out.

33:45.100 --> 33:50.480
But then today, before the show, as you might have seen on the webcam if you're watching,

33:50.740 --> 33:53.780
I was calibrating the TV to look nicer,

33:53.920 --> 33:56.500
which I don't really notice anything, but whatever.

33:56.900 --> 34:01.480
Actually, I noticed that the chat room's more readable than usual, except when people use colors.

34:01.480 --> 34:09.320
But anyway, so we were watching that and said,

34:09.320 --> 34:14.400
do not go beyond your abilities or something and showed someone like trying

34:14.400 --> 34:17.200
to pry off something on a circuit board and getting electrocuted

34:17.200 --> 34:20.060
and the house started getting electrocuted and then it burst into flames.

34:20.180 --> 34:24.300
And that was great because the house caught on fire and we had laughed.

34:25.320 --> 34:28.300
And then what else?

34:28.300 --> 34:38.300
Oh, not much. I ordered the rest of my parts for my cabinet. I ordered my buttons for popping music, so those are coming, along with my bezel for the monitor.

34:38.300 --> 34:43.300
You know, the little black thing that goes around it so it doesn't look like a TV, it looks more like an actual monitor.

34:43.300 --> 34:54.300
And then, um, yeah, it should be coming together pretty fast. So, that's about it. Yeah. Not too much.

34:54.300 --> 35:00.840
Alright, oh and saw scary movie three this weekend. That was funny. I heard it shattered like a gazillion records

35:00.840 --> 35:02.940
How was it? It was pretty good

35:02.940 --> 35:08.280
It was just you know like you hear the names like airplane and naked gun your expectations are high

35:09.060 --> 35:12.820
What the movie's supposed to be and it was good. It was really funny

35:12.820 --> 35:17.500
I was like a first movie that I've seen a long time actually made me laugh out loud in the movie theater

35:19.020 --> 35:23.120
But you know a lot of the jokes were ruined from the previews

35:23.120 --> 35:27.840
See, that's why I didn't want to watch those clips, because I knew it wouldn't ruin the

35:27.840 --> 35:28.840
movie.

35:28.840 --> 35:29.840
Well, no, no, no, not those.

35:29.840 --> 35:30.840
I'm talking about like the previous.

35:30.840 --> 35:33.600
Like one of the funniest ones, like the Michael Jackson thing, you know?

35:33.600 --> 35:34.600
Oh, I see.

35:34.600 --> 35:35.600
It's like stuff like that.

35:35.600 --> 35:36.600
But it was good.

35:36.600 --> 35:37.600
It was good.

35:37.600 --> 35:38.600
All right.

35:38.600 --> 35:39.600
Sounds good.

35:39.600 --> 35:40.600
So that's it.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.600
Nothing else to say about your week?

35:42.600 --> 35:43.600
No.

35:43.600 --> 35:44.600
All right.

35:44.600 --> 35:45.600
My week and my day.

35:45.600 --> 35:47.040
I had a pretty boring week.

35:47.040 --> 35:48.040
Nothing too exciting.

35:48.040 --> 35:52.200
I think I've kind of gotten sick of going to golf land to play F-Zero and all that,

35:52.200 --> 35:54.800
Because I don't know, F-Zero, now that I've unlocked pretty much everything,

35:54.800 --> 35:56.760
it's kind of like lost its flair a little bit.

35:56.760 --> 36:00.360
I mean, it's still a fun game and it's way better than Initial D.

36:00.360 --> 36:03.280
But I'm just kind of, I'm bored with it now.

36:04.600 --> 36:08.760
Plus what's weird about Golf Land, the local arcade that a lot of us play at,

36:08.760 --> 36:13.160
is that they now have two Initial D machines for

36:13.160 --> 36:17.080
a total of four cars to play Initial D with.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.720
Totally unnecessary, that money could have gone towards something else.

36:21.720 --> 36:25.400
The initial D isn't even that popular anymore, except maybe on Friday and Saturday nights

36:25.400 --> 36:26.400
there's a wait.

36:26.400 --> 36:29.160
I'll probably use that to fix or beat maybe a machine.

36:29.160 --> 36:32.600
The nights I usually go there, Tuesdays, Thursdays, empty.

36:32.600 --> 36:36.520
There's maybe one person playing constantly throughout the night, enough that one machine

36:36.520 --> 36:37.520
could handle.

36:37.520 --> 36:38.520
I don't know why they got a second one.

36:38.520 --> 36:43.640
It's kind of unnecessary.

36:43.640 --> 36:45.480
And then DDR Extreme's still cool, I guess.

36:45.480 --> 36:47.160
I'm still trying to AAA stuff.

36:47.160 --> 36:51.640
I don't think I got anything new this week, but I'm working on my heavy AAAs.

36:51.640 --> 36:57.000
a lot of single digit grades, but no heavy AAAs, but I'm working on it. For some reason

36:57.000 --> 37:05.320
I want my PA to get better, not that I'm ever going to be that great, but I can try. And

37:05.320 --> 37:09.920
then pretty much I've been working on my game of Final Fantasy X. I won't spoil where I'm

37:09.920 --> 37:15.000
at. I won't give a spoiler. I'll just say I'm at Mount, what the hell is it called?

37:15.000 --> 37:18.360
Mount Gagazil, I think it's called. That's where I'm at right now, for those of you who

37:18.360 --> 37:24.900
play the game. So I think by my estimations I'm probably about halfway, somewhere between

37:24.900 --> 37:30.040
halfway and two thirds through it. So still a ways to go and I'm trying to burn through

37:30.040 --> 37:34.760
it before Final Fantasy XI comes out on Wednesday except I don't see that really happening because

37:34.760 --> 37:39.240
I've got vanilla sky tomorrow night and then Final Fantasy XI comes out Wednesday. Now

37:39.240 --> 37:44.280
the interesting thing is I work a short week next week. I'm only working Monday and Tuesday

37:44.280 --> 37:45.420
because I have three days off.

37:45.420 --> 37:47.880
I'm supposed to go to Hollywood for Halloween,

37:47.880 --> 37:50.000
but I foresee that the trip might be canceled.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.620
I'm going to find out for sure tonight.

37:51.620 --> 37:53.300
So if the trip ends up getting canceled,

37:53.300 --> 37:54.780
that means I'm pretty much going to be stuck here,

37:54.780 --> 37:56.580
and I'm going to do nothing but play Final Fantasy 11,

37:56.580 --> 37:57.780
because I'm a freak.

37:57.780 --> 38:01.260
So that's it.

38:01.260 --> 38:03.820
A bunch of us Orange Lounge radio listeners

38:03.820 --> 38:07.540
will let you know what Final Fantasy 11 server

38:07.540 --> 38:08.420
we're going to be on.

38:08.420 --> 38:10.660
I haven't, I've kind of been staying away

38:10.660 --> 38:11.900
from information on the game.

38:11.900 --> 38:13.100
I've looked at the benchmark.

38:13.100 --> 38:18.120
looked at the demo I watched Brad lanky style if you listen to vanilla sky he

38:18.120 --> 38:23.520
he's on there a lot he was a beta tester for Final Fantasy 11 so I saw it a little

38:23.520 --> 38:27.620
bit over there but other than that I really been kind of just keeping it a

38:27.620 --> 38:30.560
surprise what all is gonna wait for me Final Fantasy 11 I haven't read up on

38:30.560 --> 38:35.680
the classes or anything so it should be exciting but the thing is is that come

38:35.680 --> 38:38.360
Wednesday I want to make sure I get the game like I want to be one of the first

38:38.360 --> 38:40.820
people with the game because I want to make sure the name I want doesn't

38:40.820 --> 38:44.660
doesn't fucking get taken, because I hate that shit when people steal my name. It's

38:44.660 --> 38:53.700
my name. Back off. I have a radio show and you don't, therefore I'm entitled to the name.

38:53.700 --> 38:58.200
And that's pretty much it. So it's kind of just anticipating my vacation next week. Yay.

38:58.200 --> 39:01.920
And then not a whole lot too exciting this week. I haven't been to play 2DX in like six

39:01.920 --> 39:06.500
weeks. I haven't been to Scandi in a while. Just golf land. And playing stuff here. Playing

39:06.500 --> 39:11.380
Castlevania. Loki bought the new Castlevania game and I'll talk more about that tomorrow

39:11.380 --> 39:17.900
night. Okay, I think we're going to do, we're going to go to a break and when we come back

39:17.900 --> 39:22.700
we'll talk about some more news and some things going on in the Milani world. I think maybe

39:22.700 --> 39:27.900
we'll do the news story next. We had a news story that aired locally here in Sacramento,

39:27.900 --> 39:33.180
California where we all live and it's comedy so you guys definitely want to stay tuned

39:33.180 --> 39:36.880
to listen for this because we're going to play it for you guys and make fun of it because

39:36.880 --> 39:43.120
that's what we do. We'll be back after a set of some five key Beatmania songs. This should

39:43.120 --> 39:50.120
be fun. We will be right back.

40:43.120 --> 40:48.120
.

40:48.120 --> 40:53.120
.

40:53.120 --> 40:58.120
.

40:58.120 --> 41:03.120
.

41:03.120 --> 41:08.120
.

42:38.120 --> 42:52.120
I'm out to play, gonna have me some fun In a world that is totally mine

42:52.120 --> 42:54.120
showing my

42:54.120 --> 42:56.120
my

42:56.120 --> 42:58.120
my

42:58.120 --> 43:00.120
my

43:00.120 --> 43:02.120
my

43:02.120 --> 43:04.120
my

43:04.120 --> 43:06.120
I'm on the floor, feel myself in the light

43:06.120 --> 43:08.120
Moving shoulders

43:08.120 --> 43:10.120
to your feet

43:10.120 --> 43:12.120
As I'm turning

43:12.120 --> 43:14.120
I'm still with the light

43:14.120 --> 43:16.120
So my heart comes to my feet

43:16.120 --> 43:18.120
When I

43:18.120 --> 43:20.120
dance I'm feeling the love

43:20.120 --> 43:24.120
The light, measure I stay with the keys

43:24.120 --> 43:28.120
As the movie happens, I'm still with the sky

43:28.120 --> 43:35.120
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B gave me

43:58.120 --> 44:01.120
and join us on all the fun together.

44:01.120 --> 44:02.840
But hey, if you're a broke ass like I am,

44:02.840 --> 44:03.800
why don't you come to the one place

44:03.800 --> 44:05.540
that costs absolutely nothing to go to

44:05.540 --> 44:07.480
and still the fun is just as great.

44:07.480 --> 44:10.000
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.320
Kick it with me and you just might realize

44:12.320 --> 44:15.200
the best things in life are free.

44:15.200 --> 44:17.540
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio,

44:17.540 --> 44:19.200
episode number 66.

44:19.200 --> 44:21.600
Okay, so shifting gears a little bit,

44:21.600 --> 44:23.200
we wanted to cover this.

44:23.200 --> 44:26.640
We have in Sacramento our local UPN affiliate.

44:26.640 --> 44:30.440
So right off the bat, you know this is going to be class television, okay?

44:30.440 --> 44:35.160
We have our local UPN, United Paramount Network.

44:35.160 --> 44:36.160
United Post-A-Mock.

44:36.160 --> 44:38.920
United Crappy Television Network.

44:38.920 --> 44:40.480
United Wrestling Network.

44:40.480 --> 44:41.480
Hey.

44:41.480 --> 44:42.480
It's the only thing they're famous for.

44:42.480 --> 44:43.480
I like SmackDown.

44:43.480 --> 44:45.600
Well, that's the only show they've got, basically.

44:45.600 --> 44:46.600
That and Enterprise.

44:46.600 --> 44:48.600
And Black Television.

44:48.600 --> 44:50.660
And yes, the leader in Black Television.

44:50.660 --> 44:56.420
So anyway, UPN did this story about Dance Dance Revolution, and this aired on our local

44:56.420 --> 45:00.860
affiliate channel 31 here in Sacramento and we wanted to play the story for you

45:00.860 --> 45:04.540
as you can see you know what the real people out there have to say about DDR

45:04.540 --> 45:09.820
so if we're gonna fire up the clip here and we will be us of course stopping it

45:09.820 --> 45:16.580
and interjecting our own snide comments occasionally so here we go

45:16.580 --> 45:20.020
which we're just waiting for it to load are you gonna put on TV so Jamie can see

45:20.020 --> 45:25.020
too you don't think it'll work over there Jamie you have to come here if you

45:25.020 --> 45:29.020
you want to see it otherwise you have to just listen.

45:29.020 --> 45:31.020
When you think of video games, what comes to mind?

45:31.020 --> 45:34.020
The joystick, the chair, the set of steady eyes?

45:34.020 --> 45:35.020
It's not very loud.

45:35.020 --> 45:36.020
Can you turn it up?

45:36.020 --> 45:38.020
This is the home version on PlayStation right now of DDR,

45:38.020 --> 45:40.020
which we talked about at the top of the show,

45:40.020 --> 45:43.020
because gone are the days of Pac-Man fever, the Donkey Kong

45:43.020 --> 45:44.020
craze.

45:44.020 --> 45:46.020
This is an interactive video that swept the nation.

45:46.020 --> 45:49.020
It's definitely not for couch potatoes.

45:49.020 --> 45:51.020
And GES' Tara Moriarty is shaking her groove,

45:51.020 --> 45:54.020
saying it's John's incredible pizza in Stockton.

45:54.020 --> 46:05.020
They basically have economics playing in the background on a widescreen TV in the studio.

46:05.020 --> 46:14.140
Then they got some dumb bitch on the spot in John's famous pizza, which is pretty much

46:14.140 --> 46:15.140
like Chuck E. Cheese.

46:15.140 --> 46:17.100
It's got tons of rides and stuff.

46:17.100 --> 46:21.620
They actually have carnival rides in there, which is pretty sweet.

46:21.620 --> 46:32.620
We're playing DDR Max 2 with all the employees who aren't working.

46:32.620 --> 46:34.620
You said Justin is not there tonight?

46:34.620 --> 46:35.620
No.

46:35.620 --> 46:36.620
Justin is...

46:36.620 --> 46:37.620
He's not being let in.

46:37.620 --> 46:38.620
My bodyguards...

46:38.620 --> 46:39.620
Justin Timberlake.

46:39.620 --> 46:40.620
Okay.

46:40.620 --> 46:41.620
Not letting him in.

46:41.620 --> 46:42.620
Okay.

46:42.620 --> 46:43.620
But you are going to compete.

46:43.620 --> 46:44.620
We're having a dance-off right now.

46:44.620 --> 46:45.620
Let's show...

46:45.620 --> 46:46.620
This is Adam.

46:46.620 --> 46:47.620
They're having a dance-off.

46:47.620 --> 46:48.620
I was hoping that they could compete.

46:48.620 --> 46:49.620
There's two employees on the machine playing something on basic.

46:49.620 --> 46:50.620
Everyone in home could vote on who was better.

46:50.620 --> 47:01.620
And joining me is Yoshi. You have been doing this machine work here at John's Incredible Pizza and you've been actually practicing on this machine after work when everybody's gone home and you're really good.

47:01.620 --> 47:03.620
Yes I am. I've actually been...

47:03.620 --> 47:07.620
Pause it, pause it, pause it. What a conceited little bastard.

47:07.620 --> 47:11.620
So I hear you're good at DDR. Well yes I am actually.

47:11.620 --> 47:15.620
God, I would have loved to have been there to kick his ass.

47:15.620 --> 47:19.900
They're not talking to the person on the machine, they're talking to some guy off the machine.

47:19.900 --> 47:21.640
We're going to see him play at the end of the story.

47:21.640 --> 47:25.140
Everybody else I know that plays DDR, anybody that's good in tournaments and stuff like

47:25.140 --> 47:26.140
that, it's like this thing.

47:26.140 --> 47:28.540
Don't get me wrong, this thing bugs me too.

47:28.540 --> 47:32.380
You ask somebody if they're good at DDR, you could be talking to somebody who comes in

47:32.380 --> 47:36.220
like top three in tournaments and they'll go, yeah I'm okay, yeah I'm okay, yeah I play

47:36.220 --> 47:39.480
it sometimes.

47:39.480 --> 47:44.460
Sometimes DDR community is just like over humbled-fied, you know what I mean?

47:44.460 --> 47:47.580
If somebody asks me how good I am at DDR, I'm going to say, well, let me just put it

47:47.580 --> 47:50.660
this way, I kind of used to play it a lot.

47:50.660 --> 47:55.780
Yeah, that's more my response, I just say, I haven't played for a few years.

47:55.780 --> 47:56.780
I've practiced a lot.

47:56.780 --> 47:57.780
All right, move on.

47:57.780 --> 47:58.780
I think you have to hit play.

47:58.780 --> 47:59.780
Yeah, you have to hit play.

47:59.780 --> 48:00.780
And so, who does this?

48:00.780 --> 48:01.780
I mean, old people, young people?

48:01.780 --> 48:02.780
Everybody, now and then, they come, they try, and they really have fun on this game.

48:02.780 --> 48:10.020
play and so who doesn't I mean old people young people everybody now and

48:10.020 --> 48:13.260
then they come they try and they they really have fun on this game even if

48:13.260 --> 48:17.580
they're not good they can really dance what's the key because I mean I think

48:17.580 --> 48:22.220
it's really difficult actually the key is to listen to the beat and just watch

48:22.220 --> 48:27.400
the arrows go from bottom to top and hit the corresponding step and be

48:27.400 --> 48:28.400
You're doing like the light version.

48:28.400 --> 48:29.400
You can do heavy, moderate, or light.

48:29.400 --> 48:30.400
Yes, there's three difficulty settings.

48:30.400 --> 48:31.400
There's light, standard, and heavy.

48:31.400 --> 48:32.400
Okay, we're going to cut over to Lloyd and Beth so we can see how they are stacking up

48:32.400 --> 48:33.400
against this competition here.

48:33.400 --> 48:34.400
Let's take a look.

48:34.400 --> 48:35.400
Are you guys ready?

48:35.400 --> 48:36.400
Oh, yeah.

48:36.400 --> 48:37.400
Tara, we're picking our song.

48:37.400 --> 48:38.400
Pause it.

48:38.400 --> 48:53.480
So, okay, so they're having this dance off, quote unquote, between the people playing

48:53.480 --> 48:57.240
in the arcade and then the two hosts in the studio.

48:57.240 --> 49:00.820
I don't know how the fuck that works, but they're having a dance off, which means we're

49:00.820 --> 49:04.500
going to make asses of ourselves all at the same time on this game.

49:04.500 --> 49:06.940
He looks completely unenthusiastic.

49:06.940 --> 49:13.500
These people don't need to be touching this software at all.

49:13.500 --> 49:17.600
This is why old people... I'm sure these guys aren't touching the software.

49:17.600 --> 49:18.900
That's what interns are for.

49:18.900 --> 49:21.260
I used to be an intern at a television station.

49:21.260 --> 49:22.920
Trust me, that's what the interns are there for.

49:22.920 --> 49:26.460
These guys don't have to know shit about the game.

49:26.460 --> 49:31.900
fucking stupid. But anyways, let's watch and laugh at them as they make an ass of themselves.

49:31.900 --> 49:34.860
And in response, yeah, they were playing the whistle song at the beginning. I'm not going

49:34.860 --> 49:40.060
to pick the maniac level. No, no, no, no, no, no. Basic. I'm a basic guy. Use your arms

49:40.060 --> 49:45.060
with it too. Come on, you're a big boy. Just bounce, just bounce. Okay, ready? Left, left,

49:45.060 --> 49:54.060
left. The guy is not even looking at the screen and they're playing dive. You're not bad,

49:54.060 --> 50:08.700
Okay, basically what's happening now is the male host of the show is dancing and he's

50:08.700 --> 50:10.340
looking like he's doing the chicken dance.

50:10.340 --> 50:14.140
He's trying to play DDR, it's like nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

50:14.140 --> 50:17.300
And they're playing dive, which kind of sounds like the chicken dance anyway.

50:17.300 --> 50:23.260
And then the girl host, I shouldn't say girl, the old woman host, is leaning, she's leaning

50:23.260 --> 50:28.300
over and going, okay, up, up, left, left, right, up, up, up, down. It's like, fuck,

50:28.300 --> 50:32.120
you know, if I was just starting out at DDR, that would just throw me off. You know, she's

50:32.120 --> 50:36.000
not able to read them as fast as they're coming up the screen. I would have turned around

50:36.000 --> 50:39.580
and bitch slabbered and said, stop it. I'm making a big ass out of myself on television

50:39.580 --> 50:46.380
as it is. Leave me alone. Move on. We'll give you the link to the video at the end. Oh,

50:46.380 --> 50:53.040
and look, they failed. Pause, pause. It took them a whopping 15 seconds to fail dive. Whoever

50:53.040 --> 50:57.840
decided to pick a four-foot song for these two incompetent hosts to play on the start

50:57.840 --> 51:03.280
of... That was a bad mistake. That intern is so fired. That intern is so genius. He's

51:03.280 --> 51:06.640
like, I fucking hate those bastards. They make me do all their fucking work for them.

51:06.640 --> 51:12.640
I'll make them look like fools on TV. And now the male host is so shocked that he failed.

51:12.640 --> 51:21.160
He has Sylvester Stallone face. He's got like, ooh, ooh dream, ooh foot trip. Meanwhile,

51:21.160 --> 51:28.160
employees are still going at it on the whistle song. And not working. Uh oh. And uh, okay

51:30.200 --> 51:37.200
here it goes. So now the female host is asserting her authority and just yanking the other two

51:37.200 --> 51:48.640
So now the female host is asserting her authority and just yanking the other two employees off

51:48.640 --> 51:54.720
the machine and letting the third employee, who happens to be a DDR maniac here, put in

51:54.720 --> 51:55.720
his coin.

51:55.720 --> 51:59.320
And then you get to pick your own song.

51:59.320 --> 52:01.640
Pick your own song, pick your own difficulty level.

52:01.640 --> 52:03.240
Oh, chords in Japanese.

52:03.240 --> 52:04.440
Take out who you want to play,

52:04.440 --> 52:05.760
which is one right now. This game will give you a teaser.

52:05.760 --> 52:06.880
It's max two, by the way.

52:06.880 --> 52:08.880
20 seconds.

52:08.880 --> 52:10.120
Okay.

52:10.120 --> 52:12.520
He's gonna do the heaviest difficulty possible,

52:12.520 --> 52:14.600
and this guy, I mean, this is like a workout.

52:14.600 --> 52:17.080
I mean, if you don't want to go to aerobic class, or...

52:17.080 --> 52:19.520
So you go straight for a healing, vision, and angelic mix,

52:19.520 --> 52:21.280
because he's gonna show how big his dick is

52:21.280 --> 52:22.120
right here on TV.

52:22.120 --> 52:24.360
Just, we'll just fade out here, Beth.

52:24.360 --> 52:29.400
just catch this guy says ready and then he just follows the arrow and he also

52:29.400 --> 52:32.120
picked the song with a woman's gonna have to stretch for like 20 seconds to

52:32.120 --> 52:35.240
build this blank spot everybody starts gathering around and then you have these

52:35.240 --> 52:43.160
little dance-offs look at him go I'm so fucking amazed

52:43.160 --> 52:47.680
get a kick out of this okay Cara thanks a lot I could see my reflection listing

52:47.680 --> 52:52.240
of area locations for dance dance dance revolution positive playstation by the

52:52.240 --> 52:53.280
Pause it.

52:53.280 --> 52:54.880
God, she did not go dance, dance, dance.

52:54.880 --> 52:58.160
Yes, she just said dance, dance, dance, revolution.

52:58.160 --> 52:58.920
Too big.

52:58.920 --> 53:01.440
It's like either she read the teleprompter wrong

53:01.440 --> 53:02.920
or something happened.

53:02.920 --> 53:05.440
You're playing dance, dance, dance, revolution.

53:05.440 --> 53:07.120
Oh, is there going to be a RPG mode?

53:07.120 --> 53:10.160
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance,

53:10.160 --> 53:11.680
dance, revolution, revolution.

53:15.880 --> 53:18.760
Let the bitch finish.

53:18.760 --> 53:23.760
And Xbox is going to come out with a version that's DDR UltraMix, and

53:23.760 --> 53:26.920
the one we have in our studio is thanks to Jim and Suzanne Eckes.

53:26.920 --> 53:30.040
So check- Okay, and then that's it, it just cuts off.

53:30.040 --> 53:32.200
Notice how they say nothing about economics in there.

53:32.200 --> 53:36.080
They say nothing about, Max 2 is out now and you can buy it.

53:36.080 --> 53:39.640
This is further proof that Microsoft is trying to buy out the world with this

53:39.640 --> 53:40.680
stupid Xbox thing.

53:41.680 --> 53:44.480
Because there's another place, and we'll talk about this later in the show,

53:44.480 --> 53:47.000
where they have a huge advertisement for DDR.

53:47.000 --> 53:51.280
On the Xbox, they say nothing about, oh, Max 2 available now.

53:51.280 --> 53:54.240
It's all about, no, the Xbox version's coming out.

53:54.240 --> 53:54.740
What?

53:54.740 --> 53:58.640
When she said right at the beginning of the thing that she said for PlayStation.

53:58.640 --> 54:00.240
But she was playing Kinomics.

54:00.240 --> 54:02.640
She wasn't even playing what's available right now.

54:02.640 --> 54:06.880
And thanks to these two people who are probably interns or something,

54:06.880 --> 54:08.360
just brought it in.

54:08.360 --> 54:10.960
I would have been like, oh, fuck this Yoshi bitch, man.

54:10.960 --> 54:13.200
I want to fucking do doubles and kick his ass.

54:13.200 --> 54:16.400
And be like, oh, man, that makes me so wet and hot

54:16.400 --> 54:19.640
because he's so sexy, he's better than that Asian man.

54:19.640 --> 54:22.200
Oh man, I want a piece of that.

54:22.200 --> 54:23.840
And then they would have all been like,

54:23.840 --> 54:25.600
oh my God, he is so cool.

54:25.600 --> 54:26.760
You know what, Rob?

54:26.760 --> 54:28.280
I think we need to write down and say,

54:28.280 --> 54:31.120
hi, we host a radio station about Bimani

54:31.120 --> 54:32.480
and we think you're stupid.

54:34.120 --> 54:35.680
Love, Orange Zones Radio.

54:35.680 --> 54:37.920
I will write that letter if you want me to.

54:37.920 --> 54:40.140
I will write that letter telling them, you know,

54:40.140 --> 54:40.980
that their article was-

54:40.980 --> 54:42.320
They should interview us.

54:42.320 --> 54:43.880
You know what though?

54:43.880 --> 54:46.640
I don't think we need to waste our time with it.

54:46.640 --> 54:47.760
I'm gonna be honest with you.

54:47.760 --> 54:50.160
I just, you know, let it be, whatever.

54:50.160 --> 54:51.600
We've got bigger fish to fry

54:51.600 --> 54:54.360
than trying to get our faces on UPN network.

54:57.520 --> 55:00.000
All right, if you want to watch that story

55:00.000 --> 55:01.920
and laugh at it yourself,

55:01.920 --> 55:06.100
the link is www.upn31.com

55:06.100 --> 55:08.120
and Telemores Lounge Radio sent you.

55:08.120 --> 55:09.140
The link there, by the way,

55:09.140 --> 55:12.080
is on the bottom right of the page.

55:12.080 --> 55:16.800
It says, Beth and Lloyd cut a rug in a video game dance-off.

55:16.800 --> 55:19.760
Who the fuck says cut a rug anymore?

55:19.760 --> 55:22.680
I just ate Taco Bell, and I've got to cut a rug right now.

55:22.680 --> 55:24.560
Hello, and welcome to The Cut Piece.

55:24.560 --> 55:25.480
That's cut the cheese.

55:29.080 --> 55:31.080
Oh, man, I've got to cut a rug.

55:31.080 --> 55:34.000
Rob, that's cut the cheese.

55:34.000 --> 55:35.520
Whenever I hear cut a rug, it makes

55:35.520 --> 55:39.160
me think of farting, or queefing, probably.

55:39.160 --> 55:41.000
Ew.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.640
I got to vibrate the rug a little bit.

55:43.640 --> 55:48.400
Cutting a rug, isn't that what porn stars do, they get prepared for their videos, they

55:48.400 --> 55:50.840
cut their rug and make sure the carpet's all trimmed.

55:50.840 --> 55:54.920
That's called shaving their private area.

55:54.920 --> 55:57.560
Cutting a rug doesn't make me think of dancing.

55:57.560 --> 56:00.280
Dancing and cutting a rug are completely different.

56:00.280 --> 56:05.240
To cut a rug, you have to be bent over in actually cutting the rug with a knife or something,

56:05.240 --> 56:15.880
Whereas dancing, you're gyrating about to music, so I don't get it, stupid hippies.

56:15.880 --> 56:20.760
All right, we're going to take a break, and when we come back, we're going to talk a little

56:20.760 --> 56:23.720
bit about an interesting- We'll come back and take scissors to your

56:23.720 --> 56:24.720
carpet here.

56:24.720 --> 56:28.880
Yeah, and we're going to cut the rug here in the studio when we get back, and when we're

56:28.880 --> 56:32.200
done cutting the rug, we'll get into the Orange Launch cage match, so make sure you're in

56:32.200 --> 56:34.000
the chat room so you can vote in tonight's cage match.

56:34.000 --> 56:40.560
And we're going to talk about a really interesting location, probably, dare I say it, the most

56:40.560 --> 56:43.200
interesting place I've ever seen a DDR machine.

56:43.200 --> 56:47.720
And I don't think I've seen a unique thing like this anywhere, so we'll talk about that

56:47.720 --> 56:48.720
when we come back.

56:48.720 --> 56:49.720
I have.

56:49.720 --> 56:50.720
Have you?

56:50.720 --> 56:52.080
All right, we'll talk about it when we come back.

56:52.080 --> 56:56.780
This break, I think we're going to do some DDR Euro stuff.

56:56.780 --> 57:00.940
So let's do some music from- Let's just have some Eurobeat, why not?

57:00.940 --> 57:01.940
You want Eurobeat?

57:01.940 --> 57:02.940
You want Para Para music this break?

57:02.940 --> 57:08.500
for some palapala. Alright, we'll do that. We'll do God. People are going to hate us

57:08.500 --> 57:12.880
for this one. Yeah, but Nastila's going to piss his pants. It'll be short and painless

57:12.880 --> 57:18.380
you guys. Okay, we'll be back after some quick block of music from Parapara. We'll be back,

57:18.380 --> 57:19.380
Orange Launch Radio.

57:48.380 --> 57:53.380
Lost me, lost me, lost my power Turning evil, making evil, surfing forever

57:53.380 --> 57:56.380
Clicking evil, cocking evil, starting to get

57:56.380 --> 57:59.380
Every single level, play the level, dunking the well

57:59.380 --> 58:02.380
And put them to dust during the morning of the night

58:02.380 --> 58:05.380
I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire, this is how ya

58:05.380 --> 58:08.380
Make a second in your heart

58:08.380 --> 58:11.380
I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire, burning wire

58:11.380 --> 58:14.380
It's the light of your life

58:14.380 --> 58:17.380
Bang bang fire, bang bang fire, bang bang fire

58:17.380 --> 58:20.380
This desire, big obsession in your heart

58:20.380 --> 58:23.380
Bang bang fire, bang bang fire, bang bang fire

58:23.380 --> 58:26.380
Burning wire, it's all into your life

58:26.380 --> 58:41.820
Please don't listen to my word

59:11.820 --> 59:13.820
Don't come too far, don't come now

59:13.820 --> 59:15.820
Three, two, one

59:27.820 --> 59:29.820
Hurry up, my little guy

59:29.820 --> 59:32.820
Everyone is getting all the secrets, baby

59:33.820 --> 59:35.820
Come on, baby, come on, boy

59:35.820 --> 59:38.820
Won't you really be the only one here to talk to you?

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:12.820
You were saying to me, that fight is a future coming

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:16.820
You're all night, about five-two-thousand, come down

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.820
Three, two, one

01:00:48.820 --> 01:01:09.540
I need to touch a body, touch a body, cause I don't want to talk about it, talk about

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:10.540
it now.

01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:15.540
I need to move my body, move my body, please, don't wait for me, please, please, cause you

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:20.540
There's nothing on the night floor I'm looking for a yellow banana door

01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:23.540
Take me like a sea prune and lay down all your body

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:26.540
I'll give you like a tune if the sun comes on down

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:29.540
Shake, shake, let me close down my body up

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:32.540
Look at the moon, light it all around

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:35.540
Time to stay on the night street

01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:38.540
Light up, take off your suit and dance with me tonight

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:41.540
My sweet, my sweet banana

01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:42.540
Yeah, yeah

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:44.540
I think of you every hour

01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:48.540
My sweet, my sweet banana

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:51.540
I wanna dance till the morning, boy

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:54.540
My sweet, my sweet banana

01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:57.540
I wanna feel like your mama

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:00.540
My sweet, oh, sweet banana

01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:04.540
You know the fruit that I'm not against you

01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:34.140
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, this is Orange Lounge Radio, welcome back to Orange

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:40.500
lounge radio. I believe we've been doing this show what? 66 weeks now. I think that is probably

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:44.940
only the second time I can ever remember us doing a para para music break.

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:49.480
You know what? I couldn't help it when Eurobeat was on. I found myself starting to do part

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:53.140
of that one. That was my first para para.

01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:56.500
Those songs, by the way, for you guys, Tony and the main band don't know much about the

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:59.780
game. Boom Boom Fire was the first one. That was probably, I think for most of us, the

01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:05.960
first PAH we learned. Not everybody, but most of us. It was my first PAH. The second one

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:14.880
was the club, the one named after the PAH club. Third was Eurobeat, my favorite PAH

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:27.400
PAH song, and last was My Sweet Banana, one of Jamie's favorite PAH PAH songs.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:30.640
Some interesting comments made in the break there.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:35.960
There was one about, I think Rice Princess was talking about how 2DX para para songs

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:36.960
are really cool.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.680
They're like some of the better ones, and there needs to be more of them in 2DX.

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.520
Like if 2DX just needs more songs, just take some from Parma Para.

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:51.200
One of my early six stars was a Pata Pata song, and my first seven star was a Yerby.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.840
Also I believe it was-

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:54.840
Actually, my first two sevens.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.080
No, I take them back.

01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:01.040
My second three, out of the first three that I passed, the second and third ones, were

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.040
Eurobeat.

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.040
Sorry.

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:06.360
My first one was Please Don't Go.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.600
DD Archaholic was saying something about asking, have you ever driven to Eurobeat and Para

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:11.600
Music?

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.600
But you know what?

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.560
Para Para Paradise was the first soundtrack I ever bought.

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:15.560
I'll admit it.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.680
It was the first Bimani soundtrack I ever bought, was Para Paradise.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:23.160
And driving to that, that's the only time I think I ever hit 90 in my car, and I drive

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.160
like a grandma, okay?

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:30.120
You've been in the car with me with my Eurobeat.

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:36.480
I am a very safe, over-safe driver and when I put that CD in, I go like 90 miles an hour.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:40.640
You've been in the car with me with my Eurobeat.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:41.880
I don't remember who I was.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:48.440
It was Ryan, somebody said that I get all cool when I drive with Eurobeat.

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.320
I was like, what do you mean by cool?

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.320
He was like aggressive.

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:53.880
What do you think happened with Parapara?

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:56.800
I want to ask this question to anybody who wants to answer.

01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.080
What happened with Para Para?

01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.080
It came out.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.200
It was the coolest fucking thing on the block.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.440
Everybody wanted to go to Milpitas Golf Line to play at Para Para because it was like,

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:08.340
oh, it's like DDR but it's your hands.

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:10.160
Then what happened next?

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:13.080
Probably a month later, it didn't come down to about a month later when people were finally

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:17.320
realizing oh, there are set dances you're supposed to do to these things.

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.760
And then it kind of turned into this big dancing thing.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:23.100
And I remember there was a time where you could go to a place like Milpitas Golf Line

01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:25.020
And there'd be one person up on the machine, there'd be 20

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:26.500
people behind him doing the same thing.

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:27.820
And that was the cool thing to do.

01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:31.020
And then all of a sudden, huge fucking backlash

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.060
against Para Para.

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.900
And then it just became the people who held out versus

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:37.340
Para Para Para versus everybody else.

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:40.540
And I even admit that I was totally into Para when it

01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:41.020
first came out.

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:41.860
I bought the soundtrack.

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:44.140
And then there was just a day when I was finally listening

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:46.860
to it going, this all fucking sounds the same.

01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:47.540
And that was it.

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:48.820
I was done with Para Para.

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:50.660
And I think it was about the time it was released for the

01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:51.540
home version.

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:56.220
I taught myself four pa-pa-pa's so I could go to the arcade and blend in with the crew

01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:57.220
crowd.

01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:01.180
And then I just didn't give a shit anymore and I didn't really care about anything.

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:03.500
I remember when RBGL got the pa-pa-pa machine.

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:04.500
I remember that too.

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:08.380
And there were people who were staring at that scratch in their butts going, ugh, what

01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:10.100
do we do?

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:15.460
And then we got up there and Rick ate the paper that says, do not shadow.

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:20.080
Oh yeah, it was great because at Sunnyvale Golf Land, their machine used to have a big

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:23.700
sign on it saying do not shadow because if you've been to Sunnyvale Golf Land you can't

01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:27.040
fucking walk down the aisle if there's anybody standing in it, right?

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:29.720
So you don't want to have people standing there shadowing and it was like this big thing

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:33.520
too because Sunnyvale Golf Land is kind of where the backlash sort of began I think.

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:37.120
A lot of those people who think they're cooler than everybody else kind of started that whole

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:41.880
thing and then they had the big sign on there that said don't shadow.

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:44.660
Well what ended up happening, that machine got moved from Sunnyvale to Roseville Golf

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:45.660
Land.

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:49.520
The first day it came in one of our regulars over there took the paper off the machine

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:53.380
and ate it. It was hilarious and we have a picture of it hanging out of his mouth. Kind

01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:58.620
of a symbolic thing like, kind of, screw you, we're going to do what we want.

01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:05.540
And I remember, it would usually be, I'd play, you'd shadow, and someone else would shadow

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:12.140
too. One of the people in the shadow. Who else was it? Was it Anita?

01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:16.260
No, this was when we first knew Anita. I don't remember.

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:20.460
So there was a couple of people, just the parents were funny.

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:21.440
Oh yeah.

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:26.780
They'd be like, huh, we're stupid, what you doing?

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:31.560
Some different theories from the chat room as to what happened to Para Para

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:32.620
and why it's not cool anymore.

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:36.060
Snubdismoid says, I think people saw themselves playing.

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:37.380
That's what it ended.

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:42.080
When somebody just saw themselves playing and went, God, I look like an ass.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.440
I don't really care.

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:48.080
Stapler X says, looks just like another passing Japanese trend.

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:51.960
I think for me, is I stopped going to RVGL.

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.480
That's a big part of it too.

01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:54.480
I would say...

01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:55.480
I play when we go to Miggle.

01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:56.480
You know what?

01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:57.920
People look stupid when they play DDR too.

01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:02.520
So I don't know if people seeing themselves playing is necessarily a turn off, because

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:05.000
you look just as stupid playing DDR.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.880
And in fact, like Dance Maniacs, that's the worst.

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:08.880
Okay.

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:15.520
Okay, I love Dance Maniacs, and you know what, I'm fucking building a Dance Maniacs machine.

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:19.400
My machine covers everything, but Dance Maniacs is part of it, so there.

01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:23.680
I'm just saying, that's cool, I love Dance Maniacs too, but you look like a total boob

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:24.680
playing it.

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:25.680
I mean, that's the thing.

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:26.680
Hey, Rob?

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:28.680
Yeah, but it's fun, it doesn't matter.

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:29.680
What?

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:31.680
You said boob.

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:34.680
I did say boob.

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:43.600
Okay, SD Driftking says my DWI is equal to forearm exercise.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.800
You don't want to know what my forearm exercise is.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:47.840
Moving on to the next topic.

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:51.840
Actually, I want to address DDRgolic's idea about what happened.

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.720
She says, I think what happened is all the haters started being haters and ruined it

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:56.720
for everyone.

01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:03.560
Well, you know what I say, if haters are bothering you, you need to fight hate with hate.

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:08.820
stand for that shit. Outnumber them and make fun of them. That is how you're going to stop

01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:15.540
the haters. You fight hate with hate. We used to fight them with making fun of them. I remember.

01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:19.460
And it worked. The people that make fun of DDR, we would totally, we would just like,

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:23.460
we'd gang up on them, like some kind of geek gang. We'd like all, remember the guy that

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:27.020
made fun of me one night playing DDR and then like 10 of us, we all just kind of like jumped

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:29.780
him, like sort of thing. We were like, hey, you want to get up there and fight him? You

01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:35.940
play against him and he ran to the bathroom and cried and you offered to pay for his game and then

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:40.900
there's all those other people who i would just have thrown out haha guess what if you're gonna

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:50.900
make fun of us then you don't just play anything all right i think it was because you know um

01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:57.300
submitting you know uh kind of playing pair of pairs kind of like almost just like converting

01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:03.560
over to being metrosexual. That's why people weren't playing it, because they're afraid

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:08.440
of the bright, shiny side, if you would like to call it that.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:11.880
What do you think would happen if you were to show that to the folks from Queer Eye for

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:15.780
the Straight Guy? I've never watched that show.

01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:19.480
Crab people, I think. Even the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy people would go, okay, that

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.880
is too gay. Get that out of your house. That's too gay. Too gay.

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:26.720
Well, you want to know what, though, before- It's going to be in this house.

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:30.880
Before there was a pata pata, though, I don't know if you remember, but there's videos that

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:32.760
I found way back when.

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:34.320
Yeah, the pata videos.

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:40.040
No, the ones where they were demoing the game in Japan with the little girls with their

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:42.960
flowery shirts doing the pata pata on the machine.

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:46.820
It's because the little Japanese girls are fucking hot, and they're like, I'll do whatever

01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:47.820
you want.

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:53.220
And then also, the guy got that guy, Bucky, to fucking come over here and just beat ass.

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:59.260
If he was the main star of the game, people would be just falling over that game.

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:02.660
Jumping backwards a little bit, about three people in the chat room because of the buffer

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:06.300
are asking, what is metrosexual?

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:11.060
Apparently you haven't watched South Park, but anyway, metrosexual is where you act

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:13.140
gay, but you're not gay.

01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:18.220
It's kind of like being high in fashion stuff and that type of thing.

01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:21.100
Metrosexual is being gay to get chicks.

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:26.380
It's like the thing where five years ago, make fun of gays, can them, all this stuff.

01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:27.380
Trust me.

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:30.500
I was afraid to come out for a long time because I didn't want to face this backlash.

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:35.180
Now, five years later, if you're gay, you're cool.

01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:40.660
It's like being metrosexual is being one of those guys that's kind of up there going

01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:46.780
on a date with some woman at a candlelight dinner, yeah, I blew a guy once, just experimenting,

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:52.940
thing and that's supposed to like make them more attractive you know I think

01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:59.820
it's better to be that than manual than manual sexual it's just like that means

01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:05.740
yeah anyways it's like you know I think it's just like you know okay define it

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:12.300
manual has to do with using your hands okay it's like it's like you know how

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:16.500
smoking was cool back in the 90s and stuff it's like being gay is cool now

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:22.680
in like the year 2000 and so on. Next year will be like bestiality or something. It's

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:34.080
just it's fads. Hey kids, be cool. Fuck a sheep. All right. Yeah, I know gay people

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:38.040
are cool. Okay, somebody in the town was saying gay people are cool. Leave being gay to the

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:44.080
gay people, okay? We're good at it, okay? Why don't you leave being gay to the gay people

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.760
And like, if you're straight, good for you.

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:49.880
If you're bi, hooray.

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:51.720
OK, now I'm being corrected on this too.

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:55.720
If it's metrosexual or metrosexual, it's either or.

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:56.800
They mean the same thing.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:59.200
People say it either way, because metro, hetero, get it?

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:00.680
Metro is like city.

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:03.160
Well, right, a metro is kind of what it's supposed to be.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:06.480
But people say metro, it's kind of formed into that.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:09.000
Metrosexual.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.160
They're saying in the chat room, Ben Affleck

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:13.800
is a perfect definition of a metrosexual.

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:18.740
I would say more like Justin Timberlake is a perfect example of someone who's metrosexual.

01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:24.520
He does all these really fucking gay things like being an NSYNC, right?

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:28.600
Yet, he's blinking Britney Spears.

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:29.600
Not anymore.

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:34.000
Not anymore, but he can say something that 99% of straight guys dream of.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.360
He banged Britney Spears before she went lesbosexual or whatever it's called when a woman goes,

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:46.000
cool to be gay by making out with Madonna. He's like, I was so good she could never have

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:55.920
another man after me. That's why she's gone lesbian and that's even hotter. Anyway, so

01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:02.440
the moral of the story is, leave being gay to the gay people. Be accepting, but be straight,

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:07.200
okay? That's all we ask. Going back to my live journal post about national

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:16.520
whatever days. You know what? They need to have National Blowjob Day. They do have all

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:22.000
these sex appreciation day, masturbation day. I'm sure they have a blowjob day somewhere

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.640
on the calendar, Jamie. You just don't have it penciled in. You know what? That's because

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:33.880
they're gross. I will look it up. Loki is going to look up National Blowjob Day for

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:40.800
you all. Okay, let's shift gears a little bit. I want to ask a question to the chat

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:44.960
room, going back to something actually Bahmani related. Send this to me over private message

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:50.120
by the way, because I'll read these later. I want to hear from people who aren't in Sacramento

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:54.140
first off. Thank you guys for listening, our local friends, but I want to hear from people

01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:58.320
outside of Sacramento. I want to hear the strangest place you've ever seen a Bahmani

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:03.380
machine, whether it be DDR or something like that. I want to hear the strangest place you've

01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:09.980
ever seen a DDR or some kind of Bimani machine? Because what we found out this week, let's

01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:15.940
rewind to Monday, Monday vanilla sky. After vanilla sky was over, lanky style rice princess

01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:19.400
and I, we all went to Walmart to do some shopping or at least I was shopping. I wanted to go

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:25.900
buy cheesy poofs basically. So I was going to Walmart to buy some cheesy poofs and hold

01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:26.900
on.

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:27.900
October 3rd.

01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:30.500
Loki says national blowjob day is October 3rd

01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:35.220
It's also national go commando day, so

01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:42.540
National blowjob day is October 3rd, so if you missed national blowjob day. I want you to celebrate tonight, okay?

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.500
So here's your chance to make that point

01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:52.100
Happy belated anyone to participate with you then get some flexibility all right there you go now

01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:54.320
Can I get back on the topic of strange moly machines okay?

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:57.520
So send me a private message, strangest place you've ever seen a Bimani machine, I'm Skye

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:03.160
in the chat room over at www.calibimani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:08.680
The No Skye went to get cheesy poofs and usually, whenever I go to Wal-Mart I can't help but

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:12.160
go into the electronics department because they have cheap electronics.

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:17.440
Cheap mouses, cheap CDs, cheap games, cheap everything because Wal-Mart is the land of

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:18.440
everything cheap.

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:24.400
But for whatever reason, on this Monday we went to toys and games, we went to stuffed

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.400
animals and things like that.

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.640
We did not go into the electronics department.

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:31.840
Come to find out Tuesday morning, this comes up on the boards at sacramonday.com, hey guys,

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:34.120
did you hear?

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:35.960
Walmart got a DDR machine.

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:37.360
And I'm thinking to myself, no they didn't.

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:41.600
I was just there at the Walmart in Folsom on Monday and there was no DDR machine to

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:42.600
be found.

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:47.880
Well, it turns out this DDR machine is smack in the middle of the electronics department

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:54.600
at Walmart. Now, most Walmarts, I think, are all laid out the same. For those listening

01:17:54.600 --> 01:18:00.000
internationally, Walmart is this huge chain of stores in the U.S. Big, big, big store

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.560
that sells everything. Most Walmarts, I think, are laid out the same. So like when you walk

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:09.400
in the electronics department, you have your CDs off to one side and then off to the other

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:16.320
side in this Walmart, giant DDR solar machine just standing right there. Fully operational,

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:21.280
It takes 50 cents to play three songs or get three coins or whatever it is.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:25.400
Now I've heard of a Walmart having a DDR machine out in the front arcade or an arcade on the

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:32.200
side, but I have never heard of a machine anywhere in the middle of a fucking store.

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:35.440
So of course, couldn't resist, had to go play it today.

01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:40.520
I had to go rent some errands anywhere at Walmart, so I went to go play the Solar 2000

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:41.520
machine.

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:45.020
And again, I want to state, this isn't like the Walmart and Lodi or other places that

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:48.820
had it in the front, or in a separate arcade.

01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:51.900
This Solo 2000 machine is right smack in the middle of the electronics department, so as

01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:55.180
everybody's walking by, people can look at it.

01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:57.780
The machine is not for sale, they're not trying to sell it.

01:18:57.780 --> 01:19:03.060
In fact, they even have a sign on the Solo 2000 machine that says, hey, the Xbox music

01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:09.180
game, they changed it, I guess they updated it, but last week it said, hey, the Xbox music

01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:12.620
generator's coming out on such and such day, I got nothing to do with you.

01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:13.700
They changed it today.

01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:18.060
It says Xbox DDR coming out November 18th, right?

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:20.940
Again, says nothing about the PlayStation Max 2.

01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:23.820
It says nothing about the already available DDRs out

01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:24.540
there on PlayStation.

01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:26.500
It's all about promoting the Xbox.

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:28.900
It's almost like Microsoft bought them that machine and

01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:30.500
put it in the store.

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:31.540
I don't know.

01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:33.700
But now we have this DDR solar machine in

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:34.660
the middle of Walmart.

01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:36.500
It won't be there for long because the parents will see

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:39.140
the needles and the barely dressed nurse.

01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:40.300
That's what I was thinking.

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:41.340
Walmart.

01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:47.200
king of censors. This is the one reason I won't really buy CDs at Wal-Mart. I'll look

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:53.100
and see what's new, but I won't buy, because I fucking hate that Wal-Mart censors the albums.

01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:56.780
You go to buy an album at Wal-Mart, and you will buy the desensitized version. Look at

01:19:56.780 --> 01:20:00.300
the fine print, look on the label, and you will see that a CD you're buying at Wal-Mart

01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:05.420
is the edited version, meaning they've taken out all the fucks and shits and cop killer

01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:12.620
Even a CD like Madonna's American Life that just came out, the Walmart version in track

01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:17.580
one, the first song, they took Fuck It out because, oh, heaven forbid, we're going to

01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:18.580
hurt our children.

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:21.880
That is so horrible.

01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:23.980
I don't think things should be changed like that.

01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:26.620
Somebody wants to say fuck, let them say fuck.

01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:30.880
Put the sticker on it that says, caution, this CD says fuck on it and then don't let

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:31.880
parents...

01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:38.400
That's another case of companies taking responsibility for other people's children.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.960
Why should Walmart do that?

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:40.960
They shouldn't.

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:45.080
Why don't they just not sell the CD that says, caution, the CD has the word fuck in it.

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:50.660
If the parents don't want the children to listen to something with bad language in it,

01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:54.200
they need to freak and police what their children are doing themselves.

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:58.480
Walmart should not have to institute these kinds of policies, but they do because they're

01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:59.680
run by the religious right.

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:05.680
a whole other story. I prefer calling them the religious wrongs.

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:11.640
Anyway, that's a discussion for a whole other show. Yes, thank you. Excellent point by Leadfoot

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:17.280
in the chat room. Yet, they sell rated M games in the gaming section. They'll sell rated

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:21.160
M games, but heaven forbid they sell a CD with the word fuck on it.

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:25.360
It's just a video game, Rob. How bad could it be?

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:29.640
I know. Did you hear about these parents that are suing the makers of Grand Theft Auto because

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:34.140
some people got shot. No, it's not the parents. It's the relatives of the victims who got

01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:38.880
shot because some kids went out and imitated Grand Theft Auto. Sue the kids' parents for

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:44.280
being idiots. Yeah, seriously. It's not the game's fault. It's the damned impressionable

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:51.820
people. They're the social sheep of the world. Anyway. They could be just taken off and shot

01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:56.620
or something. Anyway, back to DDR before we got off on a little bit of a tan. Back to

01:21:56.620 --> 01:22:00.260
DDR in the middle of Walmart. It's quiet. You can't really hear it unless you're on

01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:05.060
it. The pad is so close to the machine that literally I'm 6'2". This is the first time

01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:08.920
I've ever played DDR. I have to look down to see the machine. I have to look down to

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:14.760
see the screen. It's really weird. It should be just about right for me. Oh, jazz makes

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:18.900
an excellent point in the chat room. Get up and move is in DDR solo 2000 which has the

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:24.140
word fuck in it. Oh no. I'm going to go there and play get up and move over and over and

01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:57.220
I am like Yoshi.

01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:59.100
How does that work where they were paying you to play?

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:00.100
What do they do?

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:01.100
They're all here.

01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:02.100
We'll give you a hippie sense.

01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:05.660
We're supposed to give you a hippie sense so you can play this.

01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:08.100
It's just because of people that aren't there paying attention.

01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:10.180
There's one nice guy though that's been there the last few times.

01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:11.980
He offered to pay for my games.

01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:12.980
He did for one of them.

01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:13.980
I was like, no, that's cool.

01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:14.980
I got the other ones.

01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:21.540
I don't want him to just pay me to play the game, but it was all right.

01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:23.420
It's kind of cool.

01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:27.380
I just don't like their pads because they're like squishy and they hurt my ankles when

01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:36.540
you play it with like the wrong kind of shoes, but I think it's kind of cool what they're

01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:37.540
doing.

01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:41.940
It's just like for some reason, UltraMix is getting a lot of press it seems like for me

01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:46.340
because I mean, look at you have the news story, you've got like machines in stores.

01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:51.660
It's like that's all your hair runs this goddamn UltraMix, I don't know.

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:54.380
It's like they're really pushing this one.

01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:56.900
The Walmartrion, they're dubbing it in the chat room.

01:23:56.900 --> 01:24:01.340
The Walmartrion is located in Folsom, California, on Riley

01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:02.340
Street, I think it is.

01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:05.260
Yeah, that's where the, you will find a DDR solar machine

01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:06.500
in the electronics department.

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:07.820
In other words, way out in the little nowhere.

01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:10.180
I want to hear if any other Walmarts are doing this.

01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:12.580
So check your local Walmart and let us know if your

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:12.940
Walmart's done this.

01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:13.980
Maybe this is the one in Lodi.

01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:16.460
Maybe, maybe they moved that one in Lodi, who knows.

01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:18.460
Anyway, I want to get back to the question I posed earlier

01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:21.020
to the chat room and read their responses here.

01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:24.100
We've got a whole bunch, so let's hear about some strange

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:27.740
places, huh?

01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:28.980
Let's see.

01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:36.820
Zodiac Knight says, the strangest place you ever saw a

01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:40.380
DER machine was at a tri-county flea market.

01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:45.500
DER machine and flea market.

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:46.740
The tri-county flea market.

01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:52.980
Baca says, strangest place you ever saw a DDR machine was in a pizza parlor.

01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:57.860
Well, it's kind of a weird sight at first, but yeah, it's kind of common where we are.

01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:09.480
We see, let's see, Bumlover says, I saw a DDR machine in my butt, wow, that's so mature,

01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:12.280
thank you for sharing.

01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:17.880
No Stylin says, Walmart once had a Beatmania 5 key before DDR became popular.

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:21.040
That was kind of strange.

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:25.160
Snub Disinoid says, pump it up in the middle of an airport in Brazil.

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:28.020
Listen, like right in the middle of the fucking terminal.

01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:29.020
That's kind of cool.

01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:34.640
Pump it up machine right in the middle of the Brazil airport.

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:41.840
Jazz kind of cites a pizza parlor as well and the Beatmania in Walmart.

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:45.640
John Field says, a pizza hut, would you like cheese on your

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:47.520
pads, he says.

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.480
So a lot of pizza parlors kind of be in a strange place

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:50.040
for you to go.

01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:51.640
I think the reason why the pizza parlor thinks.

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:53.160
I know one, a McDonald's.

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:54.360
I've heard of one being in the McDonald's.

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:56.400
What, Loki, say that in the?

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.240
A McDonald's.

01:25:58.240 --> 01:25:59.520
Loki says a McDonald's.

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:04.520
There's also, I was told this, there was a BeatMania 6 mix, I

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:08.680
think, in the middle of the mall outside the arcade in

01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:11.560
Mobile, which I'm going to actually go see if that

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:13.800
machine is there or not when I'm there?

01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:17.840
OK, I'm not even going to read that one,

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.720
because that makes sense.

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:21.440
I said strange place, see a DDR machine.

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:30.240
Seeing a DDR Extreme machine in the Metreon, says StaplerX.

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:31.320
That's a strange sign.

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.240
That is a strange sign, because they held out

01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:34.240
for the longest time.

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:40.480
And then says a DDR machine in a bowling alley by my college.

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.420
It's in great shape because no one ever plays it

01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:44.860
except the occasional drunken bowler.

01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:45.940
There's colleges.

01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:48.540
They have a solo basement.

01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:54.100
And also, seeing a DDR machine outside of the CBS studios

01:26:54.100 --> 01:26:55.660
in New York.

01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:58.940
John Fields wants to remind us of that when the CBS Today

01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:00.460
show or whatever the hell it's called

01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:01.860
did their little thing on location.

01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:03.260
And that thing was really stupid.

01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:04.380
Yeah, it was really stupid.

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:08.900
Tapioca Express, having a DDR machine,

01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:10.100
that was always kind of funny.

01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:11.540
one that's nearly dead now.

01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:51.300
is at the arcade in the Winchester Mystery House. Really? Yes. I think it was short lived though.

01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:56.740
Is this getting off all the ghosts? I don't know. The fact that they have an arcade at

01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:08.740
the Winchester Mystery House is strange enough. I want to go there. Okay, a couple last responses

01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:11.140
here, and then we're going to get into the cage match.

01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:12.620
Strange DDR machine places.

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:16.740
StaplerX says, one being in San Francisco's Chinatown, just

01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:18.700
out in the middle of an alley somewhere.

01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:21.380
I remember there supposedly being a Solo 2000 machine

01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:23.740
somewhere there, so maybe that's the case.

01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:26.860
Or maybe somebody realized Solo 2000 is just kind of old, so

01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:28.340
somebody just kind of chucked it in the alley.

01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:34.260
And then, oh, a DDR Solo machine in the middle of the

01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:35.140
baseball field.

01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:39.880
Rayleigh's Field here in Sacramento has a Solo 2000 machine just right there out on

01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:45.880
the, what do they call that, the course, the, what the hell do they call that, or the concourse?

01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:46.880
Thank you.

01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:47.880
The concourse.

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:48.880
The concourse.

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:49.880
Yeah.

01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:50.880
All right.

01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:51.880
All right.

01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:54.000
Let's get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Whoops.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Wow.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:01.600
That was a gay little cage match there for a minute.

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:05.880
Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio cage match was a tie and it came down to Jamie

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:10.160
having to cast a tiebreaker vote via the internet.

01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:17.120
And she chose in a tiebreaker above and beyond with a song, Far From In Love.

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:21.440
The way the cage match works, just a reminder, we're going to play three songs for you guys.

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:22.440
You vote for your favorite.

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:26.880

because it won last week.

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:47.520
So here's a long clip of above and beyond with the song far from in love tonight's first

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:54.520
pick for the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match.

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:27.520
Like a fire burns in the mood, I know this is where it ends

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:32.520
In the ashes we are dying, I'm a stranger

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:37.520
Only friends fly from the night

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:43.520
From the night

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:52.520
You know I don't know how to feel so far away

01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:57.520
Gonna let me in

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:06.520
From all the love inside you

01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:13.520
Now I've missed your touch

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:27.520
I've missed your touch

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:34.520
I've missed your touch

01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:38.520
I miss you so much

01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:42.520
Far from it all

01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:46.520
I'm trying to show all the love that is built up inside

01:31:46.520 --> 01:32:10.860
All right, that was song number one, last week's winner, Above and Beyond with Far From

01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:11.860
in Love.

01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:15.840
All right, second song in tonight's cage match, you get to hear the whole thing and it's kind

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:21.900
a long one but it's Loki's pick and he has picked for you. It's a remix, it's a white

01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:27.900
label remix of Broken Wings by Mr. Mr and I guess this one's also by Emotion, it's a

01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:33.480
group. It's remixed by a group on the internet, well it's a group of DJs, all women called

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:39.480
the Diva DJs and it's pretty sweet so I just found this today because I was looking for

01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:46.480
White Label remixes.

01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:16.720
Alright here's song number two in tonight's cage match emotion featuring mr. Mr. With a song called broken wings. Enjoy

01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:44.480

01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:49.480
the

01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:54.480
the

01:34:54.480 --> 01:35:01.480
the

01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:06.480
the

01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:43.480
We can't just talk to each other's hands

01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:02.480
This time might be the last of the year

01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:12.480
Listen, make it up to me, I need you so

01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:23.960
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:29.440
Singing these broken wings.

01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:32.420
Learn the mind.

01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:35.940
Learn the lips of freedom.

01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:41.940
And when we hear you, the voices sing

01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:48.940
The folk of love hang up and let us sing

01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:55.940
Let us see

01:36:55.940 --> 01:37:03.940
Let us see

01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:12.940
Let us see

01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:36.900
We can take what was wrong, and make it right.

01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:39.900
Make it right

01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:43.900
Yeah

01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:47.900
I know I can't

01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:54.900
Baby

01:38:55.900 --> 01:38:57.900
Is all I know

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:02.900
That you're half of the flesh

01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:07.900
And love that makes me whole

01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:17.900
I need something like you

01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:25.900
Hey baby, we're the broken wings

01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:32.900
Long live the rest of me

01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:36.900
When we meet

01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:39.900
But with me

01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:43.900
I've got nothing

01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:45.900
And I pray

01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:50.200
Okay, that was song number two tonight, Emotion, featuring Mr. Mr. with Broken Wings.

01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:51.960
Let's go around and see what everybody thought of that.

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:53.960
We'll start off with our guest, Bradley, tonight.

01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:58.420
That was okay, I didn't really get into it very much.

01:40:58.420 --> 01:41:03.500
I'll give it a seven.

01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:10.700
I love the 80s, so it gets a 10, because it's one of my favorite 80s songs.

01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:19.700
You know, I love the 80s too, but even the original put me to sleep instead of that one, so it gets a 7.

01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:22.700
It wasn't a bad mix, but it was pretty damn repetitive.

01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:24.700
I can't find my inhaler.

01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:29.700
At 3 minutes in length, that song would have gotten a 10, but at 7 minutes in length, it gets a 7.

01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:31.700
I don't know, I can't find my inhaler.

01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:33.700
Alright.

01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:39.700
Okay, let's move on to the last song in tonight's cage match, which would be Jamie's pick.

01:41:39.700 --> 01:42:07.100
This song is cool and I had it on repeat 10 times today.

01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:10.400
Here's song number three tonight, you can vote for CyberX featuring Rapinoe with Like

01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:25.400
a Flower.

01:42:55.400 --> 01:43:00.400
I don't want to die without you

01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:31.400
upper

01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:32.400
middle

01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:33.400
mid

01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:34.400
lower

01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:35.400
mid

01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:36.400
lower

01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:37.400
middle

01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:38.400
one

01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:39.400
two

01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:40.400
three

01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:41.400
four

01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:42.400
five

01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:43.400
six

01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:44.400
seven

01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:45.400
seven

01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:46.400
eight

01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:47.400
nine

01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:48.400
ten

01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:49.400
nine

01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:50.400
nine

01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:51.400
ten

01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:52.400
nine

01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:54.400
one

01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:55.400
two

01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:56.400
three

01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:57.400
four

01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:58.400
five

01:43:58.400 --> 01:43:59.400
six

01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:01.400
Oh

01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:31.400
Oh

01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:31.400
I

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:09.400
I can't wait to see you in the next video!

01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:23.400
I can't wait to see you in the next video!

01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:30.980
As long as I stay away, don't only lose hope,

01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:43.260
Okay, that was song number three for tonight.

01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:47.100
That was CyberX featuring Rapinna with Lil Flower.

01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:48.500
Let's go around and see what folks thought of that.

01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:52.180
Bradley, you're going to need to grab this mic unless you get up and grab Jamie's.

01:47:52.180 --> 01:47:54.180
What'd you think, Bradley?

01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:55.780
This is okay.

01:47:55.780 --> 01:47:58.700
Her voice sort of got to me a little bit.

01:47:58.700 --> 01:48:03.700
I didn't really like the voice all that much. Wait a second. I'll give it a 6.

01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:05.700
Okay. Loki.

01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:08.700
This is okay. I'll give it a 6.

01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:13.700
I like that way better than the song you picked last week, actually.

01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:15.700
Sounds very IU-trans to me, actually.

01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:18.700
I seriously thought I was listening to IU-trans for a minute there.

01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:22.700
I seriously would give that a 10, except I think it needs to be a little tighter.

01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:25.700
Same problem I had with the last song.

01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:31.700
So, I give it like a... I give it a nine. It's not bad. I could stand listening to that.

01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:36.700
I think I like best that it kept changing throughout the whole song, all the background did.

01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:43.700
So, I give it a nine and a half. I haven't listened to it all day, so...

01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:47.700
I want a trans version of the Chicken Dance.

01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:49.700
You know, I have one.

01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:53.700
I actually, yeah. Haven't you been threatening to put that in for a while now?

01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:54.700
Perhaps.

01:48:54.700 --> 01:48:55.700
We'll see.

01:48:55.700 --> 01:49:10.860
Okay, so let's review the three songs you can vote for tonight, shall we?

01:49:10.860 --> 01:49:12.420
Let's start off with song number one.

01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:17.320
It's last week's winner and the song is called, it's above and beyond with a song called Far

01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:20.740
From In Love.

01:49:20.740 --> 01:49:28.920
I don't like that clip.

01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:35.720
Song number two you can vote for tonight is Emotion featuring Mr. Mr. with Broken Wings.

01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:47.320
Here's a clip of that.

01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:51.820
here is song number three you can vote for tonight, which is Cyber X featuring Rupina

01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:54.320
with a song called Little Flower.

01:49:54.320 --> 01:50:07.320
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. My mouse is being over-scented today. Okay, let's try that again.

01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:19.320
There you go. There's your three songs you can vote for tonight. Place votes now. Send

01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:24.680
a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote and we'll tally up those votes

01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:29.720
and let you know in a little while who won tonight's cage match. Doesn't that sound exciting?

01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:35.640
We need to do something else soon too. What's that?

01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:42.440
What are we best known for, Rob? Ranting, the FUs of the week? Yeah! We'll do those

01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:45.920
in a little bit. We'll do those next break or something. What is Loki whispering to me

01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:53.680
here? He's whispering something to me. I'm on top of it. I'm on top of it. I did not

01:50:53.680 --> 01:51:01.520
need to be prompted. While Loki ran off to the bathroom, I was going to have him do a

01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:22.680
I don't know that I'll be able to play the show, but I may have some degree of internet

01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:25.200
access so at least I'll be in the chat room.

01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:29.660
I'll have pre-shows done, I'll have my cage match picks in case, you know, the winner

01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:30.660
don't.

01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:38.420
So, I'll be there in spirit, maybe I'll eat some beef and pee so you can smell my beefy

01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:39.420
pee.

01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:40.420
Hooray!

01:51:40.420 --> 01:51:42.420
For those who were listening in the first hour of the show.

01:51:42.420 --> 01:51:44.060
I said I don't eat beef.

01:51:44.060 --> 01:51:45.060
I'll eat some asparagus.

01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:46.060
Okay.

01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:47.060
It has some really stinky pee.

01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:48.060
That'll work.

01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:53.660
So, going off, let's plug the spin-off shows, what's going on on the spin-off shows, because

01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:55.980
I want to know what's going to happen in public volume.

01:51:55.980 --> 01:51:58.820
Monday nights on the station, Vanilla Sky.

01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:01.940
Tomorrow night we're going to be talking about some big news in the Final Fantasy world that

01:52:01.940 --> 01:52:02.940
came up this week.

01:52:02.940 --> 01:52:07.500
Let's talk about that and Castlevania for review and break down on our thoughts on the

01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:14.380
new Castlevania and other stuff that we usually talk about on Vanilla Sky, just randomness.

01:52:14.380 --> 01:52:19.720
As I kind of compare it, it's sort of that Oprah show on Oxygen, the one that's after

01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:21.220
the real Oprah show.

01:52:21.220 --> 01:52:22.300
I do not watch Oxygen.

01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:29.980
I've just heard about it. I've never heard of it. Oh, forget it. Tell us what's on Tuesday

01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:38.060
nights, Jamie. Pump up the volume. Starting at seven o'clock with the pre-show. I don't

01:52:38.060 --> 01:52:42.460
know what time my show starts. Seven o'clock with the pre-show. 730 starts the show show.

01:52:42.460 --> 01:52:47.380
If you are in the chat room, you can request shit. I'll play it, because I'm nice like

01:52:47.380 --> 01:52:54.100
Although I may be doing requests, I may have to be a little bit more judicious because

01:52:54.100 --> 01:53:05.660
I'm going to be recording this one because it's going to repeat while I'm in Alabama.

01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:10.700
The week after though, I'm doing the show on Monday because I will be on an airplane

01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:11.700
on Tuesday.

01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:12.700
Right.

01:53:12.700 --> 01:53:14.180
So our show will swap next week.

01:53:14.180 --> 01:53:21.940
We're going to swap next week, but I've pre-recorded, I recorded last week's show

01:53:21.940 --> 01:53:23.840
and I'm going to record this week's show again.

01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:28.280
And you'll get to hear them if you miss them, which you have no excuse to have missed them.

01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:30.040
I kick you.

01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:34.500
It's over at 1030 and you have to be in the chat room or else you miss the full experience.

01:53:34.860 --> 01:53:36.060
That's right, just like with this show.

01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:39.920
Anything else to plug with the volume?

01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:42.280
Give me drugs.

01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:51.280
Okay. Wednesday nights, coming back the week after next, if I'm not mistaken. You gonna be ready for it, Loki? The week after next?

01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:53.280
Uh, yeah.

01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:55.280
Week after next comes what?

01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:57.280
I'll be as ready as I normally am.

01:53:57.280 --> 01:53:59.280
Moving to Wednesdays is?

01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:03.280
Is, uh, I'm just kidding. Livewire.

01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:07.280
Lesbian hookers in outer space, Loki presents. No.

01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:09.280
Ooh. I like that.

01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:10.580
I like that.

01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:15.660
Well, change it to bondage lesbian hookers from outer space.

01:54:15.660 --> 01:54:18.900
And what happens on bondage lesbian hookers from outer space?

01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:27.260
I play music while bondage lesbian hookers from outer space entertain me.

01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:28.500
Sounds good.

01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:31.420
November is going to be a big month for the station.

01:54:31.420 --> 01:54:34.100
I swear to God we will have a new website done.

01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:35.940
I have so many ideas for the website.

01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:37.580
I want it to be so comprehensive.

01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:39.580
I just fucking suck at designing websites.

01:54:39.580 --> 01:54:41.580
We need pictures first.

01:54:41.580 --> 01:54:42.580
Get the pictures.

01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:43.580
Bust the pictures.

01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:44.580
I want a website.

01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:45.580
I want pictures.

01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:46.580
I want a website.

01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:47.580
Website?

01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:48.580
No, pictures.

01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:49.580
I'll take pictures right now.

01:54:49.580 --> 01:54:51.580
I don't want pictures.

01:54:51.580 --> 01:54:52.580
None of me.

01:54:52.580 --> 01:54:54.580
I'll have to make some for you on Patreon.

01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:59.580
We can just, like, do a picture of, like, some character from, you know, 2DX or something.

01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:00.580
DJ Celica.

01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:01.580
There you go.

01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:04.580
Why don't I just give you all the pictures I made of Dark Sakura?

01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:05.580
No!

01:55:05.580 --> 01:55:15.460
Well, you're going to be the junior senior robot now, so I swear to God we'll have a

01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:18.420
new website this month at some point because I'm sick of the old one.

01:55:18.420 --> 01:55:19.980
I want to be the junior senior robot.

01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:22.900
We have a new location for the site that we're going to unveil too and everything.

01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:23.900
It's going to be coming up.

01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:28.380
We have all that and then we have some new specials.

01:55:28.380 --> 01:55:29.380
We're planning for November.

01:55:29.380 --> 01:55:31.180
We're going to be doing some new specials.

01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:35.260
I just got an idea for one today that's going to take a lot of work, but it's going to be

01:55:35.260 --> 01:55:41.380
really fucking cool if I can pull it off. So we're going to do that. Yes. So we're going

01:55:41.380 --> 01:55:46.580
to work on that for November. Also in November, the whole way you hear Orange Lounge Radio

01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:50.060
will probably be changing. We're going to sound even better. Even though you're still

01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:54.300
on the modem line, if you have an MP3 codec, we're going to sound even better. That's coming

01:55:54.300 --> 01:56:01.340
in November. And of course you can't forget episode 69. Episode 69 and unfortunately Jamie

01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:06.620
won't be here for episode 69, but she will be here for episode 70, which I think is what

01:56:06.620 --> 01:56:11.140
I said would be the season four premiere, but I'm not sure. I'm not sure yet. So lots

01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:14.580
of stuff coming to Orange Launch Radio in November, which makes sense because it's November

01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:20.660
sweeps. All right. We're going to take a break and I'm going to tally up the votes to the

01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:24.740
cage match. Last call for votes on the Orange Launch cage match, by the way, while we take

01:56:24.740 --> 01:56:29.820
this break. The chat room is asking, since we're kind of doing these themed breaks tonight

01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:31.000
of a certain Bimani game.

01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:35.900
The chat room is begging, please can we do an oha break?

01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:40.940
So I'm saying sure, let's do an oha break tonight.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.740
So we're going to hear the oha ska and we'll hear why,

01:56:43.980 --> 01:56:46.720
the zona song and we'll hear candy.

01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:51.700
We'll be back and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:27.700
Don't forget to subscribe to this channel and like and share the video

01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:29.700
Thank you so much for watching

01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:31.700
I hope you like the video

01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:33.700
I love you

01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:35.700
Thank you so much

01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:37.700
Thank you

01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:39.700
Thank you

01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:41.700
Thank you

01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:43.700
I love you

01:57:43.700 --> 01:57:45.700
Thank you

01:57:45.700 --> 01:57:47.700
Thank you

01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:49.700
Thank you

01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:21.700
Oh

01:59:19.700 --> 01:59:23.700
Don't give it up, don't give it up, you're a star

01:59:49.700 --> 01:59:52.240
La, da.

01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:54.420
La, da, la, la, la.

01:59:57.920 --> 02:00:00.240
La, da.

02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:04.720
La, da, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:06.720
Oh

02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:31.240
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:33.240
Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?

02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:35.240
No!

02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:37.240
Do we care what people think of us?

02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:39.240
No!

02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:41.240
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:43.240
Yes!

02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:51.240
Extreme Bimani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:55.240
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, also coming in November. New promos!

02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:58.240
We're getting rid of all the old promos, all of them.

02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:02.240
No, we're getting rid of all the old promos and replacing them with new ones.

02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:06.240
Okay, well, yeah, the ones with other people in them we'll keep, like Mel and Step Squad.

02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:09.240
But the other ones, forget it, they're gone.

02:03:09.240 --> 02:03:11.240
All right.

02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:12.240
Welcome back to the show.

02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:15.240
We'll get into the FUs of the week in a little bit.

02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:19.240
But, Loki, you ran off to the bathroom before I could ask for a Sim update

02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:21.240
and what's going on in the Sim world this week.

02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:26.240
And I know there's at least Tourney Mix 4th Plus.

02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:34.240
Good God, TourneyMix 4th Plus is going on drei.com, so go there if you really give a shit.

02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:40.240
I've lost all hope in TourneyMixes anymore. I really just don't care anymore.

02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:44.240
I don't plan on entering them. I don't really care. I just...

02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:49.240
I haven't played set maybe in months. I'm waiting until my cabinet's done, then I'll play on that.

02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:54.240
But, really, I don't like people's sim files anymore.

02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:57.240
There's only a few people's sim files that I download anymore,

02:03:57.240 --> 02:03:59.240
and the rest, just fuck it.

02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:01.240
I don't even download them anymore.

02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:05.240
And to be honest, the Japanese people make better sim files

02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:08.240
than you fucking Americans and Europeans will ever make.

02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:09.240
So shut up.

02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:11.240
There's only a few of you that are any good,

02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:14.240
and you know what, and you people know who you are,

02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:17.240
so the hell with all of you, everyone else.

02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:22.380
everyone else. There's only like, what? Three people. Okay, let's see. We've got that Matt

02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:30.060
guy. We've got Utterdude. They're awesome. We've got the people at DWI and Sandy. They

02:04:30.060 --> 02:04:34.780
make really awesome sim files. And of course, Healing Vision is part of them. Those are

02:04:34.780 --> 02:04:38.300
the only people that make any good sim files. You know what it is? You know what it is?

02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:42.780
Turning Mix has turned into the new Para Para. When it was first out, everybody thought it

02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:46.260
was cool, and now it's cool to make fun of it. That's what's going on. It's because they

02:04:46.260 --> 02:04:48.220
to keep adding more and more rules to it.

02:04:48.220 --> 02:04:49.580
And it's just retarded.

02:04:49.580 --> 02:04:56.180
But the thing is also, there's another group that was pretty

02:04:56.180 --> 02:04:58.580
good, too, in making sim files.

02:04:58.580 --> 02:04:59.540
I can't remember who they are.

02:04:59.540 --> 02:05:04.580
It's like the DWI New World Order or some

02:05:04.580 --> 02:05:05.540
crap like that.

02:05:05.540 --> 02:05:06.180
That was all right.

02:05:06.180 --> 02:05:09.620
But the Japanese people make awesome sim files better than

02:05:09.620 --> 02:05:10.540
you'll ever make.

02:05:10.540 --> 02:05:12.460
And they've been doing it for years.

02:05:12.460 --> 02:05:14.620
So just give up.

02:05:14.620 --> 02:05:16.180
Just stop.

02:05:16.180 --> 02:05:17.420
And that's it.

02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:22.960
Do people still make stuff for BM-98?

02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:23.900
Yeah.

02:05:23.900 --> 02:05:26.820
Oh, man, the stuff for BM-98 is awesome.

02:05:26.820 --> 02:05:27.860
I love BM-98.

02:05:27.860 --> 02:05:31.740
I'm sorry, but it takes a lot more talent to create a BMS

02:05:31.740 --> 02:05:38.580
file for BM-98 than it will for StepMania or DWI.

02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:39.860
We're talking key sounds.

02:05:39.860 --> 02:05:40.500
They arrange it.

02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:42.060
They make their own songs.

02:05:42.060 --> 02:05:45.580
I remember playing BM-98 before I had even seen DDR.

02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:47.760
it's just so much

02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:49.780
so is so often

02:05:49.780 --> 02:05:54.060
and you know i'm so sick of hearing about the money where because

02:05:54.060 --> 02:05:56.700
the guys who will be quit making bw eyes

02:05:56.700 --> 02:06:00.860
well here's a girl how many years ago you know i'm going to be prepared to

02:06:00.860 --> 02:06:03.420
look like that being too hard to write

02:06:03.420 --> 02:06:05.580
and yet he keeps making them

02:06:05.580 --> 02:06:06.980
if you're going to quit

02:06:06.980 --> 02:06:07.720
you quit

02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:09.300
you don't keep going back

02:06:09.300 --> 02:06:10.340
and equating again

02:06:10.340 --> 02:06:13.140
no one cares you like fighting michael jordan

02:06:13.140 --> 02:06:14.700
and he sucks now

02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:18.080
He's the Hulk Hogan of the Bimani world.

02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:19.320
It just stopped.

02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:21.760
Just stopped making sim files.

02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:24.320
But you know, the few people out there that make actual

02:06:24.320 --> 02:06:27.840
good sim files, you know, I'm willing to try a few new ones

02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:28.760
that new people out.

02:06:28.760 --> 02:06:32.040
But a lot of times, they just suck.

02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:35.520
You get one sim file that's a 12-foot rating, and it's just

02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:38.280
shit, so whatever.

02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:42.680
I just delete the rest and play the few that are good.

02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:47.160
You are no longer after creating the largest step file

02:06:47.160 --> 02:06:49.000
collection on the internet, correct?

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:49.840
I don't care.

02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:51.920
It's just I don't really care anymore.

02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:56.360
I download one of everything I don't have, but I'm not

02:06:56.360 --> 02:06:59.560
actively pursuing to have a huge collection because I'll

02:06:59.560 --> 02:07:01.720
You're not trying to have the largest step file penis on the

02:07:01.720 --> 02:07:03.360
internet, basically.

02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:05.280
Well, I probably just want to have the best looking.

02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:06.640
No, I don't really care anymore.

02:07:06.640 --> 02:07:07.880
Mine just looks nice.

02:07:07.880 --> 02:07:31.880
It's, it's, you know, my penis is quite, quite nice, but, but my Simphon collection, I don't really care, because I don't play it anymore, so, well, not until my cabinet's done, and once that's done, I'll play it again, but, you know, I don't need to sort through, like, 6,000 songs to find something I want to play, because that just takes too long, so, to hell with it.

02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:39.880
Oh, and there's some pretty cool skins out there you might want to check out for StepMania Trans Machina, which is a good one I mentioned back a while ago.

02:07:39.880 --> 02:07:44.880
You might want to go check that out. I believe it's in the StepMania thread or skinning, you can find it.

02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:49.880
And then I'm sure there's been some StepMania updates because DWI Denver updates, so screw that.

02:07:49.880 --> 02:07:57.880
And if you go to, I think it's ddramerica.com or something like that, it's that BitTorrent site I mentioned a few weeks back.

02:07:57.880 --> 02:08:05.720
They have the full set of the Max2USA stuff already done,

02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:08.600
which I already downloaded.

02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:10.640
I could have done it a long time ago, but I just don't

02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:13.320
care, so there.

02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:15.640
All right, that's it.

02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:17.960
That's all that I care about.

02:08:17.960 --> 02:08:22.600
Let's talk about, since it kind of relates to STEP files,

02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:25.360
let's talk about this whole Into the Groove thing that's

02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:26.600
coming out here.

02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:33.580
can you bring that up for us

02:08:33.580 --> 02:08:37.140
yes that's right we're going to talk about Into the Groove tonight

02:08:37.140 --> 02:08:41.660
not the Madonna song but you know

02:08:41.660 --> 02:08:44.860
I'll take an excuse to play Madonna

02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:45.700
a few things

02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:46.780
that are good about this

02:08:46.780 --> 02:08:49.060
first off you've got Keel making some of the music

02:08:49.060 --> 02:08:52.040
alright what the hell is Into the Groove don't tell me what's in it

02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:53.300
tell me what the hell is it

02:08:53.300 --> 02:08:54.080
Into the Groove

02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:55.220
is going to be

02:08:55.220 --> 02:09:00.620
a new arcade software, very similar to the DDR, that's supposed to be hitting arcades.

02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:05.660
And it's Linux-based, which whoop-a-dee-doo. But anyways, it's Linux-based, which means

02:09:05.660 --> 02:09:14.480
geeks made it. Big fucking geeks made it. But here's the thing. It's created by Chris

02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:19.540
Danford. He's working on it. He's the guy behind StepMania. So there's a lot of similarities

02:09:19.540 --> 02:09:24.620
to StepMania on there. It's pretty much a lawsuit waiting to happen, but they quote

02:09:24.620 --> 02:09:31.020
that it's, you know, too, it's very different from DDR, but looking at the screen, I have

02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:38.020
to differ. It doesn't look like it's very different at all. And it looks kind of craptastic,

02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:42.940
but anyways, they've got some nifty stuff on there, like they've got a mode where you

02:09:42.940 --> 02:09:47.820
can play where there's four arrows, just like DDR, but they're on the four sides of the

02:09:47.820 --> 02:09:51.060
screen, and so the arrows are coming out of the center towards the outside, which is kind

02:09:51.060 --> 02:09:55.020
cool now it's a little different not exactly fun to play but you know it's

02:09:55.020 --> 02:09:59.940
there then they've got you know the normal modifiers like dizzy and sudden

02:09:59.940 --> 02:10:06.260
and expand there are featured in step mania so I don't know and they have like

02:10:06.260 --> 02:10:09.900
some songs on there that are licensed songs supposedly I guess they're getting

02:10:09.900 --> 02:10:14.420
licensing for these I don't think that's gonna happen but whatever that's

02:10:14.420 --> 02:10:19.180
interesting because I see on this sample screenshot they've got atom bomb by fluke

02:10:19.180 --> 02:10:24.940
Which is like that generic trance song that's on every compilation CD ever, but it's a cool song, so whatever

02:10:26.340 --> 02:10:32.400
Baby got Adam ball, and then what Romeo and Juliet I've never heard of a lot of these other songs actually

02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:36.740
Maybe you know these I don't but you said now this is what's interesting

02:10:36.740 --> 02:10:41.180
Is that people in the DDR world are getting into this you said that keel was possibly having licensed songs on it

02:10:41.180 --> 02:10:43.220
Oh, he does and he's like, um, where'd he go?

02:10:43.220 --> 02:10:53.620
I remember when I read this, it says about Rockstar, he's on the staff, he's doing music

02:10:53.620 --> 02:10:59.120
on it, and Chris Danford is doing some other stuff on it, because we play a Keel original

02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:01.580
song on his table, we've actually been playing it for the past two years, I think it's time

02:11:01.580 --> 02:11:08.660
for us to change it, but I'm just saying, he's kind of been known in the Bimani scene

02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:11.980
a little while for making some good originals that would be good for DDR, so it's just kind

02:11:11.980 --> 02:11:14.740
of ironic that this is now going to end up in a DDR style game.

02:11:14.740 --> 02:11:22.540
Well, it's not too surprising because he has some of the songs I believe that are on, I

02:11:22.540 --> 02:11:27.780
want to say they're on that Flash game, that Flash DDR.

02:11:27.780 --> 02:11:31.740
Oh my gods, maybe they'll license Neo Max.

02:11:31.740 --> 02:11:34.740
Oh god, I don't give a shit.

02:11:34.740 --> 02:11:39.260
For those of you that keep telling me that Neo Max is going to be in a DDR mix, shut

02:11:39.260 --> 02:11:40.260
up.

02:11:40.260 --> 02:11:41.260
Just shut up.

02:11:41.260 --> 02:11:42.260
Nobody cares.

02:11:42.260 --> 02:11:44.900
That is like the most overrated thing ever, ever.

02:11:44.900 --> 02:11:49.940
It's more overrated than... I don't know, but just shut up.

02:11:49.940 --> 02:11:51.940
More overrated than max.period.

02:11:51.940 --> 02:11:52.940
Yeah.

02:11:52.940 --> 02:11:53.940
Oh.

02:11:53.940 --> 02:11:54.940
Well, I don't know.

02:11:54.940 --> 02:11:59.860
I actually think I may prefer neo-max to max.period, but fucking, who cares?

02:11:59.860 --> 02:12:07.060
Neo-max will never be on a DDR type machine because they only put good files in DDR.

02:12:07.060 --> 02:12:11.660
OK, once again, this goes back to what I was saying before.

02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:16.100
Why the fuck won't people let me put in a StepMania-based PC

02:12:16.100 --> 02:12:18.340
in a DDR machine, and we'll just do it that way.

02:12:18.340 --> 02:12:20.940
Since most of the DDR machines are violating copyright laws

02:12:20.940 --> 02:12:23.300
anyways because they have licensed music that's out of

02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:29.540
this country that don't share the licensing in the US,

02:12:29.540 --> 02:12:32.700
basically, it's like an import CD or whatever.

02:12:32.700 --> 02:12:34.820
So they're pretty much all illegal anyways over here in

02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:35.420
the first place.

02:12:35.420 --> 02:12:38.180
So obviously, Kami's not doing anything about that.

02:12:38.180 --> 02:12:41.380
If we have it in one arcade, and there's bootleg machines

02:12:41.380 --> 02:12:43.340
up the ass that no one's doing anything about.

02:12:43.340 --> 02:12:47.100
So no one's obviously going to give a shit if you put your

02:12:47.100 --> 02:12:49.740
own songs in an arcade machine.

02:12:49.740 --> 02:12:51.140
Except the only people that would bitch about it,

02:12:51.140 --> 02:12:55.780
ironically, are the people that love DDR, which they're

02:12:55.780 --> 02:12:58.180
shooting themselves in the foot, so to speak.

02:12:58.180 --> 02:13:02.580
But I don't understand why they just don't do that.

02:13:02.580 --> 02:13:05.380
In fact, I'm trying to push that on our local arcade here.

02:13:05.380 --> 02:13:07.940
but no one seems to be biting.

02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:13.460
Do you think Konami is going to sue the pants off these people

02:13:13.460 --> 02:13:15.580
that put this, if this game ends up in an arcade?

02:13:15.580 --> 02:13:18.540
Do you think Konami is going to sue the pants off them?

02:13:18.540 --> 02:13:20.820
Yes, maybe.

02:13:20.820 --> 02:13:22.420
Don't you think that's a little odd?

02:13:22.420 --> 02:13:22.940
I don't know.

02:13:22.940 --> 02:13:23.460
Will they?

02:13:23.460 --> 02:13:25.980
Because the rumor is, now rumor was a while back.

02:13:25.980 --> 02:13:27.220
I don't know if this was true or not.

02:13:27.220 --> 02:13:28.260
I'm saying it's a rumor.

02:13:28.260 --> 02:13:31.780
But rumor was one of the reasons that Konami arcade mix is you

02:13:31.780 --> 02:13:33.820
stopped seeing them is because they ran into trouble

02:13:33.820 --> 02:13:36.820
with the folks that made Pump It Up, some kind of like thing

02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:40.020
where Pump It Up got the copyright

02:13:40.020 --> 02:13:43.800
to make dancing machines in the U.S. Yeah, and the Miro,

02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:46.260
the folks that made Pump It Up had the copyrights on U.S. machines,

02:13:46.260 --> 02:13:48.120
even though they haven't done shit with it either.

02:13:48.460 --> 02:13:49.660
I mean, God.

02:13:50.620 --> 02:13:54.080
Yeah, but Pump It Up, it's just not as exciting.

02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:55.720
I don't know what Pump It Up is doing wrong.

02:13:55.720 --> 02:13:57.060
I can't put my finger on it.

02:13:57.320 --> 02:13:59.440
It just isn't as good.

02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:04.880
And I'm sorry if you're a fan of Pump It Up, but there's just something about it.

02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:07.360
It's just not the same as DDR.

02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:09.680
It's not, and it's not the fact that it's five.

02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:13.640
It's just the interface, the giant screen, the songs are subpar.

02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:17.560
I don't know what it is, but Pump It Up is not the same as DDR.

02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:23.920
Anyway, so I think it was something like DDR sued Pump It Up overseas.

02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:27.280
And so Pump It Up got the rights in America and then sued DDR here,

02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:28.000
something like that.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.760
That's the way the rumor went.

02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:33.140
So would Konami really have a right to step in and sue?

02:14:33.140 --> 02:14:35.980
Whether you did the step mania machine in some arcade or...

02:14:35.980 --> 02:14:40.240
Look at it, Konami hasn't sued step mania. If I were Konami, if I had written

02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:43.640
DDR, I would have sued the pants off of step mania

02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:46.440
years ago.

02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:50.120
I was just going to say as far as that lawsuit was concerned, it was

02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:52.940
basically, I think it was overruled.

02:14:52.940 --> 02:14:57.140
That they were considered different, therefore

02:14:57.140 --> 02:15:02.620
I'll find the stuff on it, but I believe that nothing came of it.

02:15:02.620 --> 02:15:13.780
So, basically another frivolous lawsuit that resulted in nothing. Hooray. Hooray for the judicial system.

02:15:13.780 --> 02:15:21.820
I think this is just people responding to Konami's of America's unwillingness to make a new arcade DDR release.

02:15:21.820 --> 02:15:43.820
People want fucking a new DDR mix and I'm just so pissed off with the fact it would be so easy to do. It's so fucking easy to do it and we can actually license the music because there's a loophole because it sort of would fall under the category of a AVM, what was it? It'd sort of fall under the...

02:15:43.820 --> 02:15:50.620
because it's kind of classified as a JewBox. It's a very gray area, but you could license

02:15:50.620 --> 02:15:59.140
it for a flat fee of $364 a month, or not a month, a year. That's change. That's like

02:15:59.140 --> 02:16:04.700
a buck a day. You can't tell me that no one plays that machine, not once a day. Hardware

02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:10.700
would be only a one-time buy of a PC. We wouldn't even really need to do shit to it, and upgrades

02:16:10.700 --> 02:16:13.040
to be free.

02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:17.220
I mean, it's money in the bank right there.

02:16:17.220 --> 02:16:18.140
And they're not jumping on it.

02:16:18.140 --> 02:16:22.860
Instead, they're buying $1,500 bootlegs of really shitty,

02:16:22.860 --> 02:16:26.840
hacked DDR shit that's not even that good.

02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:29.620
It's just all flawed like hell.

02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:31.260
I don't understand why people aren't jumping on this.

02:16:31.260 --> 02:16:33.420
It can work.

02:16:33.420 --> 02:16:36.940
Like I said, my proposal, I'm going to do the Golf Land.

02:16:36.940 --> 02:16:39.340
I'm going to probably show it to Keith and stuff.

02:16:39.340 --> 02:16:42.860
I'm going to redesign StepMania's thing to be just

02:16:42.860 --> 02:16:46.140
like DDR, have skins and everything to make it the most

02:16:46.140 --> 02:16:50.340
convincing arcade port, because it's not some sort of

02:16:50.340 --> 02:16:53.380
hacked shit where it's going to look like crap.

02:16:53.380 --> 02:16:57.260
Really nice steps for songs, full sets of steps, not this

02:16:57.260 --> 02:17:01.660
one difficulty shit, full sets of steps, and all that stuff

02:17:01.660 --> 02:17:02.980
with full unlocks.

02:17:02.980 --> 02:17:05.740
And you can hook it up so it runs off of

02:17:05.740 --> 02:17:07.900
credits from coin slot.

02:17:07.900 --> 02:17:13.940
It could work, but people will be like, no, because it's not

02:17:13.940 --> 02:17:14.940
official Konami.

02:17:14.940 --> 02:17:18.060
But people are going to sadly buy this piece of shit machine,

02:17:18.060 --> 02:17:20.860
and you're going to see these in arcades now.

02:17:20.860 --> 02:17:22.940
But to be honest, I don't understand why anyone would

02:17:22.940 --> 02:17:22.940
do that.

02:17:22.940 --> 02:17:23.660
Well, now give it a chance.

02:17:23.660 --> 02:17:24.780
You haven't seen this machine yet.

02:17:24.780 --> 02:17:25.620
It might be pretty cool.

02:17:25.620 --> 02:17:26.060
Fine.

02:17:26.060 --> 02:17:28.620
But still, I don't understand why people aren't jumping at a

02:17:28.620 --> 02:17:31.380
chance to do something like this, because I know Keith, if

02:17:31.380 --> 02:17:33.500
he was still at Scandia, would have jumped on this a long

02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:36.700
time, or he would have totally gone with the step mania idea

02:17:36.700 --> 02:17:37.740
for the PC.

02:17:37.740 --> 02:17:39.260
he would have done it.

02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:42.220
If I could find a way to hack the actual disk, he wanted me

02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:46.060
to go ahead and do that and make a mix that way.

02:17:46.060 --> 02:17:48.140
So why not?

02:17:48.140 --> 02:17:50.380
If people can get away with making these shitty bootlegs

02:17:50.380 --> 02:17:54.580
that really look like bootlegs, why not try to make a

02:17:54.580 --> 02:17:58.320
convincing hacked version of DDR?

02:17:58.320 --> 02:17:59.580
Whatever.

02:18:03.060 --> 02:18:03.940
I don't know, what do you think, Jamie?

02:18:03.940 --> 02:18:07.140
Would you play this new mix, this into the groove thing

02:18:07.140 --> 02:18:10.180
that's kind of like DDR, but not really?

02:18:10.180 --> 02:18:12.060
I thought from the first moment I saw it,

02:18:12.060 --> 02:18:13.820
that it looked really stupid.

02:18:13.820 --> 02:18:16.140
So no.

02:18:16.140 --> 02:18:18.300
I mean, if it's actually released, yeah, and it's

02:18:18.300 --> 02:18:20.260
there, yeah, I might give it a try.

02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:23.980
But it just looks really uninteresting.

02:18:23.980 --> 02:18:29.540
I mean, it didn't even look visually appealing.

02:18:29.540 --> 02:18:31.060
Here's my advice.

02:18:31.060 --> 02:18:34.700
If you're going to do this, and you're going to put your

02:18:34.700 --> 02:18:37.020
balls on the line or whatever, and you're going to

02:18:37.020 --> 02:18:41.080
maybe get threatened by Konami. Here is what I have been saying. Konami should be doing

02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:45.700
for the longest time. I bring this up every episode for like the past year. This is what

02:18:45.700 --> 02:18:51.620
I've said. This is how you can avoid the lawsuit and everything. Make DDR competitive. Make

02:18:51.620 --> 02:18:56.540
DDR a competitive game and now it's a completely different kind of game. Steal the dance magic

02:18:56.540 --> 02:19:00.720
mode idea but make it your own. You know, you're doing dance magic without necessarily

02:19:00.720 --> 02:19:05.420
doing dance magic. Don't fuck it up like that one Dreamcast game. What the hell was that

02:19:05.420 --> 02:19:11.420
the one shareware Dreamcast game that we reviewed on the show.

02:19:11.420 --> 02:19:12.420
Eat a Fury!

02:19:12.420 --> 02:19:13.420
Eat a Fury!

02:19:13.420 --> 02:19:14.420
No.

02:19:14.420 --> 02:19:15.420
No.

02:19:15.420 --> 02:19:16.540
That doesn't fucking count.

02:19:16.540 --> 02:19:20.520
Take Dance Magic, make it cool, there you go.

02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:27.860
This is what Konami of Japan, anybody should have done six months ago after Extreme was

02:19:27.860 --> 02:19:30.820
done and they were done with DDR.

02:19:30.820 --> 02:19:34.220
Konami of America should have put out, I don't know what the hell is stopping them, they

02:19:34.220 --> 02:19:37.740
And they should have put out a new American release by now, and this is what's going to

02:19:37.740 --> 02:19:38.740
happen now.

02:19:38.740 --> 02:19:41.060
They're going to go to court and sue these other people, and if these other people play

02:19:41.060 --> 02:19:42.540
their cards right, it's done.

02:19:42.540 --> 02:19:49.560
Konami of America is done in the arcades with DDR.

02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:50.560
But I don't know.

02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:54.500
At the same time, into the groove, it's probably going to suffer from the same thing that Pump

02:19:54.500 --> 02:19:55.500
It Up does.

02:19:55.500 --> 02:19:58.740
It might be the same, but there's going to be something about it that you're just going

02:19:58.740 --> 02:20:01.300
to go, it's not DDR.

02:20:01.300 --> 02:20:02.860
So don't try to be DDR.

02:20:02.860 --> 02:20:09.860
something different. That's why I'm saying go and be more like a competitive game or

02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:12.460
come up with something. Think of something we haven't thought of.

02:20:12.460 --> 02:20:17.580
I think if you put me in charge, if it was legit, if I could get the go ahead to do something

02:20:17.580 --> 02:20:24.580
like this, I could make a mix of DDR that would be perfect. The machine would just keep

02:20:24.700 --> 02:20:28.740
going. People would keep playing the same thing. It's just because people get bored

02:20:28.740 --> 02:20:30.820
with the same songs and stuff in there.

02:20:30.820 --> 02:20:34.060
They're bored with, like, I mean, look at DDR Extreme's been out for, like, boy, like

02:20:34.060 --> 02:20:35.060
a year.

02:20:35.060 --> 02:20:36.060
Almost a year.

02:20:36.060 --> 02:20:38.340
You know, and people are bored with it, you know, it's just like...

02:20:38.340 --> 02:20:40.140
Because DDR Extreme was nothing exciting to begin with.

02:20:40.140 --> 02:20:44.180
Half of it, half of the excitement factor was old songs coming back.

02:20:44.180 --> 02:20:48.500
The other half of it was a bunch of Konami songs that have been beaten to death in the

02:20:48.500 --> 02:20:50.580
ground already through other games.

02:20:50.580 --> 02:20:54.460
Only a couple of the Transplant songs, I can think of maybe a couple off the top of my

02:20:54.460 --> 02:20:58.020
head, Gummel and a couple, and just these things that were, like, you know, kind of

02:20:58.020 --> 02:21:01.400
They were lost in other Bomani games that became more popular again with DDR.

02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:06.560
But shit like V and A, they were cool at first, but now those songs are done because we warm

02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:07.720
out with 2DX.

02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:09.880
The dance media licenses were weak.

02:21:09.880 --> 02:21:12.680
They're the weakest they've ever been in a DDR game, ever.

02:21:12.680 --> 02:21:17.940
The U.S. licenses in DDR were better than anything they licensed in Extreme.

02:21:17.940 --> 02:21:24.380
I'm saying right now that pretty much, last thing I heard about DDR was it was an interview

02:21:24.380 --> 02:21:30.500
with Naoki that they did for this last DDR Extreme like party, live party thing that

02:21:30.500 --> 02:21:35.500
they're reporting on on BOMISEL. They had a little thing there on there showing the

02:21:35.500 --> 02:21:39.740
song list where they're talking about. And it sounds like that Naoki is going to be working

02:21:39.740 --> 02:21:46.560
now on Beatmania stuff strictly because they're putting, DDR is not going to, it's either

02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:53.620
done completely as far as arcade and maybe possibly home versions in the Japanese home

02:21:53.620 --> 02:21:56.560
versions, it's either done completely, or they're putting

02:21:56.560 --> 02:21:59.240
it on hiatus for a few years.

02:21:59.240 --> 02:22:00.920
And they're going to come up with something new.

02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:06.920
And so people are like, they want more of this stuff.

02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:08.880
I mean, you're getting new fans to it, and they're going

02:22:08.880 --> 02:22:10.280
to the arcade and playing it, and they're like, OK,

02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:11.480
I'm bored now.

02:22:11.480 --> 02:22:13.640
Maybe it's just different to us here.

02:22:13.640 --> 02:22:17.080
But don't tell me DDR is dying in Japan, because we read it

02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:18.400
here on Monday on Vanilla Sky.

02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:19.040
We read it.

02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:21.520
DDR Extreme, one of the top 10 selling games

02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:22.520
in Japan this week.

02:22:22.520 --> 02:22:24.720
Japan, a highly competitive market for video games.

02:22:24.720 --> 02:22:26.480
Extreme still lands in the top 10.

02:22:26.480 --> 02:22:28.600
The home version, where DDR fucking sucks at playing.

02:22:28.600 --> 02:22:29.080
Look at 2DX.

02:22:29.080 --> 02:22:30.040
Don't tell me DDR is dying.

02:22:30.040 --> 02:22:30.760
Look at 2DX.

02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:32.840
They're like, oh, well, we need a petition before we release

02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:34.480
another home game.

02:22:34.480 --> 02:22:35.400
What?

02:22:35.400 --> 02:22:36.160
You need another.

02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:37.560
Unheard of here.

02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:40.360
If they tried something like that here, I mean, granted,

02:22:40.360 --> 02:22:41.520
the US isn't Japan.

02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:43.800
But if they tried something like that here, they'd get

02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:45.040
laughed out of the country.

02:22:48.440 --> 02:22:52.360
I'm just saying, the only trouble you're going to run

02:22:52.360 --> 02:22:56.920
it to if you run a machine like this is you're gonna get RIA you know well these

02:22:56.920 --> 02:22:59.560
songs aren't licensed or whatever you know that's the only trouble you're

02:22:59.560 --> 02:23:03.560
in rent to konami is not even give a shit about the fact that your machine is

02:23:03.560 --> 02:23:06.220
you know a bootleg or something like that because your machine isn't supposed

02:23:06.220 --> 02:23:09.200
to be over here in the first place cuz you're promoting awareness for the DDR

02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:12.300
home versions which is the only thing Konami of America gives a shit about

02:23:12.300 --> 02:23:17.980
right now yeah so I mean DDR Extreme or whatever you know those aren't supposed

02:23:17.980 --> 02:23:20.940
to be over here those aren't licensed for u.s. and this is something this is

02:23:20.940 --> 02:23:25.500
This is the hilarious thing, somebody brought this up, somebody made a damn good point and

02:23:25.500 --> 02:23:28.340
of all places DDR freak this week.

02:23:28.340 --> 02:23:36.180
I was reading it and somebody said in the instruction manual to Max2USA it says go play

02:23:36.180 --> 02:23:38.180
DDR in the arcades.

02:23:38.180 --> 02:23:43.660
Says go for the full experience of DDR go play it in the arcades.

02:23:43.660 --> 02:23:45.780
What the fuck are you going to find in the arcades?

02:23:45.780 --> 02:23:49.060
You are not going to find DDR USA anywhere in the arcades anymore.

02:23:49.060 --> 02:23:53.220
Tell me, somebody tell me, in Nortel, where there is more Bahamati machines than anywhere

02:23:53.220 --> 02:23:54.220
else in the nation.

02:23:54.220 --> 02:23:56.860
Make it California, period.

02:23:56.860 --> 02:24:00.760
Can anybody name me three places to have a DDR USA machine?

02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:02.540
Can anybody name me three places to have a DDR USA machine?

02:24:02.540 --> 02:24:04.100
I can't even think of one.

02:24:04.100 --> 02:24:05.100
Maybe the Metreon.

02:24:05.100 --> 02:24:06.100
The Metreon, one.

02:24:06.100 --> 02:24:08.380
You're not going to find one?

02:24:08.380 --> 02:24:11.960
When you're telling people to go out and play DDR in the arcades, you're telling them, go

02:24:11.960 --> 02:24:18.400
and play the machine that says, don't play it because it's illegal outside of Japan.

02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:20.320
It doesn't make sense.

02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:21.880
They're preaching two different things.

02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:24.240
They're like, yeah, this isn't supposed to be over here, but

02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:26.280
it's over here, so whatever.

02:24:26.280 --> 02:24:27.240
Go ahead.

02:24:27.240 --> 02:24:29.680
I don't think that there's much that they can do as far as

02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:32.480
complaining that there's licensing or whatever as far

02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:34.760
as music goes, because the machines aren't supposed to be

02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:35.640
over here in the first place.

02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:36.600
Music isn't licensed.

02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:38.720
So you would run into that.

02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:41.520
This is my own thing, is why DDR USA, they're turning their

02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:46.080
back on it, just saying, oh, they're pretending they don't

02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:48.160
notice that DDR Extreme exists, because they're not

02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:51.960
having to pay for the licensing and hey all these great songs we're not having to pay

02:24:51.960 --> 02:24:58.160
for and they promote our home releases and if we try to do this the RIAA sucks so fucking

02:24:58.160 --> 02:25:02.240
much that they'd be taking all our money to do these licenses and it's not worth it. It's

02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:07.120
not worth it. Have Japan license the songs for us that's I bet you anything that is the

02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:14.080
true reason why Konami of America doesn't they pretend that the importing doesn't exist

02:25:14.080 --> 02:25:16.120
Because then that way, they don't have to worry about

02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:16.680
licensing.

02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:18.160
It's all on Japan.

02:25:18.160 --> 02:25:20.960
And then if an artist or a record label comes back and

02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:24.680
says, well, I've seen these things all over.

02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:25.820
That's out of our control.

02:25:25.820 --> 02:25:27.160
The Japanese movie, that's out of our control.

02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:28.360
We can't stop them from reporting.

02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:32.480
And to be honest, I think you would get into real trouble if

02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:34.120
you started selling.

02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:36.560
Say I made a new mix.

02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:37.920
We have a new mix.

02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:39.760
I have already a logo done for mine.

02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:42.940
It's called DDR EX2, Extreme 2.

02:25:42.940 --> 02:25:46.300
So, say I made this and I went and sold it on the internet.

02:25:46.300 --> 02:25:47.600
That's where you get into trouble because you're

02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:50.420
fucking selling a bootleg hacked piece of shit.

02:25:50.420 --> 02:25:55.340
Now, if you're going to run it in one arcade on one machine

02:25:55.340 --> 02:25:57.380
and there's only one place in the world that you can play

02:25:57.380 --> 02:25:59.420
this thing, I don't see what the problem is.

02:25:59.420 --> 02:26:01.180
Because it's not like a big deal.

02:26:01.180 --> 02:26:03.100
It's not like they're losing any money from it since

02:26:03.100 --> 02:26:06.900
they're not making any more upgrades for fucking DDR.

02:26:06.900 --> 02:26:08.020
They've already had their fourth plus.

02:26:08.020 --> 02:26:09.220
It's already made its money back.

02:26:09.220 --> 02:26:12.900
It's just a machine that's going to rot away pretty soon

02:26:12.900 --> 02:26:16.020
unless you put something else in it to get more use out of it.

02:26:16.020 --> 02:26:18.180
I don't see where they're losing any money, because we

02:26:18.180 --> 02:26:20.160
have the latest version there, and they're buying all the

02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:21.540
official ones that come out.

02:26:21.540 --> 02:26:23.820
But they're not releasing anymore, so it's

02:26:23.820 --> 02:26:25.300
just useless software.

02:26:25.300 --> 02:26:28.380
It's like saying I take an arcade cabinet that has an old

02:26:28.380 --> 02:26:30.340
version of Street Fighter in there, and I put

02:26:30.340 --> 02:26:31.260
another game in there.

02:26:31.260 --> 02:26:35.580
It's the same damn thing, as far as I'm concerned.

02:26:35.580 --> 02:26:38.460
So I don't see what the problem is.

02:26:38.460 --> 02:26:46.160
John Fields is giving me a suggestion here about going to DDR Freak and looking at the

02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:53.960
California page and finding just how many USA machines are in California. Okay, so 437

02:26:53.960 --> 02:26:58.160
places to play DDR in California per DDR Freak. Let's see how many of those have a USA machine.

02:26:58.160 --> 02:27:09.020
and I just hit cancel. So out of 437 places to play DDR, one, two, three, four, five,

02:27:09.020 --> 02:27:20.580
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,

02:27:20.580 --> 02:27:26.780
eighteen, nineteen, twenty. And most of them are boomers. Most of them are all boomers.

02:27:26.780 --> 02:27:32.860
So 20 locations out of 437.

02:27:32.860 --> 02:27:33.860
5%.

02:27:33.860 --> 02:27:37.420
5% of all places that have DDR, it's a USA machine.

02:27:37.420 --> 02:27:41.220
So if you tell somebody to go out and play DDR,

02:27:41.220 --> 02:27:45.260
95% chance some newbie is going to find is not going to be

02:27:45.260 --> 02:27:46.360
playing a USA machine.

02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:48.700
They're not going to be playing a USA-made machine.

02:27:52.740 --> 02:27:53.460
All right.

02:27:53.460 --> 02:27:55.020
Yeah.

02:27:55.020 --> 02:27:56.840
Somebody's arguing how many I count.

02:27:56.840 --> 02:27:58.960
One of the places had two USA machines.

02:27:58.960 --> 02:27:59.880
I only counted it once.

02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:02.920
It doesn't count if they have two USA machines.

02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:05.760
Because really, if you look at it, most places have multiple

02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:08.760
machines, they have Extreme and Max2, and forget it.

02:28:08.760 --> 02:28:09.280
Forget it.

02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:10.760
Just leave it at that.

02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:16.040
I just don't understand.

02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:20.800
It'd be really easy just to do this.

02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:23.360
And as long as people didn't make a big deal about it, I

02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:24.280
don't see the problem is.

02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:26.080
I mean, no, I don't see anyone at Konami going,

02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:29.800
oh my god, there's a bootleg DDR Megamix.

02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:31.800
And they're selling that shit, OK?

02:28:31.800 --> 02:28:34.560
They're selling a bootleg, and no one's coming down on it.

02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:36.200
So I don't think I'm getting it.

02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:38.680
The Megamix we talked about last week with the solid green boxes.

02:28:38.680 --> 02:28:41.000
DDR Megamix, it looks like a piece of fucking shit.

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.440
People are buying it for our $1,500.

02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:46.520
As far as I'm aware, it doesn't have any new songs other than Extreme.

02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:49.480
Well, Extreme had, even though it said it had all the Fourth Mix and all

02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:50.320
that stuff.

02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:54.880
So you're buying a hacked piece of shit and selling on the

02:28:54.880 --> 02:28:57.800
internet on eBay where everyone can see it.

02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:01.440
And Konami's not coming down on them for this shit because

02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:05.360
they don't care because it's not a threat.

02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:09.800
So if I make one machine in California, one machine in the

02:29:09.800 --> 02:29:13.160
fucking world, I don't think it's going to be a threat.

02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:16.880
So they're not going to come down on me.

02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:18.480
Bradley, I've been so rude I haven't let you

02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:19.280
comment on this yet.

02:29:19.280 --> 02:29:22.960
Is there anything you wanted to say about the DDR bootleg machine, all that stuff,

02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:26.380
if I can untangle the cord from this fucking chair that likes to eat the cords?

02:29:28.220 --> 02:29:28.620
Not really.

02:29:29.460 --> 02:29:30.080
Well, okay.

02:29:30.800 --> 02:29:31.220
All right.

02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:36.080
Jamie, who's back there folding laundry, anything else you want to say on the bootleg machines?

02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:41.700
I really don't have much of a comment on it.

02:29:41.700 --> 02:29:46.480
I just think that, you know, if you look at, and this is honest, this is me,

02:29:46.480 --> 02:29:53.480
If I see a bootleg version on one side and I see an official DDR on the other, I am probably

02:29:53.480 --> 02:29:56.280
90% of the time going to play the original.

02:29:56.280 --> 02:30:03.320
I don't care if it's upgraded extreme or an extreme, I'm probably going to go play the

02:30:03.320 --> 02:30:05.160
extreme machine and that's me.

02:30:05.160 --> 02:30:10.840
But then again, I usually prefer to give my support to Konami instead of, even if it's

02:30:10.840 --> 02:30:16.240
Konami of Japan, instead of somebody's pocket.

02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:19.620
I'm not making a possible that's still another thing I'll still will play the

02:30:19.620 --> 02:30:28.260
original over over the homemade version okay all right break time when we come

02:30:28.260 --> 02:30:31.140
back we're gonna do the F use of the week so send those in over private

02:30:31.140 --> 02:30:35.100
message to sky in the chat room right now this break the theme is going to be

02:30:35.100 --> 02:30:42.100
DDR Euromix songs, the old school Euromix, we will be back.

02:31:05.100 --> 02:31:21.100
And now we meet in an abandoned studio We hear the playback and it seems so long ago

02:31:21.100 --> 02:31:30.100
And you remember the jingles used to go You were the first one

02:31:30.100 --> 02:31:32.100
You were the last one

02:31:32.100 --> 02:31:35.100
Video killed the radio star

02:31:35.100 --> 02:31:39.100
Video killed the radio star

02:31:39.100 --> 02:31:42.100
In my mind and in my car

02:31:42.100 --> 02:31:46.100
We can't rewind, we've gone too far

02:32:06.100 --> 02:32:10.100
Like a tree in the night

02:32:10.100 --> 02:32:19.100
You can't see where we're going No care in the world

02:32:19.100 --> 02:32:26.100
Maybe I'm learning why To see on the side

02:32:26.100 --> 02:32:32.100
There's no way of turning

02:32:32.100 --> 02:32:39.100
You know there's nothing more to this

02:32:41.100 --> 02:32:46.100
Tell me one thing more to this

02:32:46.100 --> 02:32:47.100
Yeah.

02:32:48.100 --> 02:32:52.100
You know that's the thing.

02:32:53.100 --> 02:32:54.100
Ahh.

02:32:56.100 --> 02:32:57.100
Ahh.

02:33:08.100 --> 02:33:10.100
You know that's the thing.

02:33:13.100 --> 02:33:14.100
Ooh.

02:33:14.100 --> 02:33:34.100
More than this, you know there's nothing more than this

02:33:34.100 --> 02:33:40.100
Tell me one day, one day

02:33:40.100 --> 02:33:42.100
There's not a way to go

02:33:42.100 --> 02:33:44.100
There's nothing

02:34:12.100 --> 02:34:28.100
When the rhythm starts to play, I dance when the earth comes and makes me swell.

02:34:28.100 --> 02:34:36.100
Like the lazy ocean at the shore, hold me close, there's way more.

02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:38.800
When the rhythm starts you play

02:34:39.100 --> 02:34:41.100
Yeah, dance with me every time

02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:43.600
It needs a blast

02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:45.960
Like the lazy intern

02:34:46.600 --> 02:34:51.300
Hold me close, I can't hear you more

02:34:51.300 --> 02:34:53.600
When the rhythm starts you play

02:34:53.600 --> 02:34:56.400
Yeah, dance with me every time

02:34:56.600 --> 02:34:58.400
It needs a blast

02:34:58.400 --> 02:35:00.600
Like the lazy intern

02:35:00.600 --> 02:35:06.820
10

02:35:06.820 --> 02:35:11.780
2

02:35:11.780 --> 02:35:15.500
3

02:35:15.500 --> 02:35:19.200
2

02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:22.960
1

02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:26.600
playing

02:35:26.600 --> 02:35:31.600
Orange Lounge Radio. If we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:41.600
Hello, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 66 in progress.

02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:48.600
After a little bit of a heated discussion about the bootleg machines versus the normal machines and da-da-da-da-da.

02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:51.600
I want to respond to a comment that came into the chat room while we were on break there.

02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:57.380
One of our new listeners, hello, wampa164, had a kind of a statement.

02:35:57.380 --> 02:36:01.260
What I like this, how you said that to the people, designing the DDR clone, running on

02:36:01.260 --> 02:36:06.980
Linux, we're huge fucking nerds, yet you're running a radio show that talks about DDR.

02:36:06.980 --> 02:36:12.300
Okay, it's a joke, I'm, you know, we're just, it's a joke.

02:36:12.300 --> 02:36:17.260
We make the joke, haha, Linux is a nerdy thing because most, you know, Joe Schmoe's run Windows

02:36:17.260 --> 02:36:21.080
95 and all that stuff and the easier run stuff, so, you know, if it's programmed in Linux,

02:36:21.080 --> 02:36:26.400
must be a nerdy thing. We realize we're big geeks and dorks. I take great pride in being

02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:29.960
a dork. There's nothing wrong with it. So there's nothing wrong with coding stuff in

02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:35.240
Linux either. It's just a joke. So please, don't take it too seriously, okay? Hello,

02:36:35.240 --> 02:36:41.800
I'm making a fucking arcade cabinet for the house. I mean, how much more nerdy can you

02:36:41.800 --> 02:36:49.000
get? Okay. Second off, I want to respond to, kind of like, you know, that we get into like

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:53.480
these big heated arguments of over DDR over like how it is kind of just more

02:36:53.480 --> 02:36:58.680
like a general kind of vibe I feel in the air this why why we get so

02:36:58.680 --> 02:37:03.920
passionate about DDR and stuff look how much this game has changed our lives

02:37:03.920 --> 02:37:08.000
look how much money this game is taken look how much money this games taken

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:12.880
from us look how much weight I've lost playing it but look I would not be

02:37:12.880 --> 02:37:18.440
living in this apartment with Loki if it were not for DDR I would not have Jamie

02:37:18.440 --> 02:37:23.520
me as one of my best friends if it were not for DDR. I would never have gotten Bradley

02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:26.040
to ever say a word nor met him if it had not been for DDR.

02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:36.240
You know what? I met Bradley at AX playing DDR. Out of the Expo 2000, wasn't it? So yeah.

02:37:36.240 --> 02:37:43.720
He was that quiet guy standing there. Meanwhile, I'm over there in my Joe costume singing Xanadu.

02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:48.240
So basically the point I want to make, DDR is obviously, if we've gone to the extent

02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:53.000
to make a show near and dear to our hearts, so we put a lot of fucking effort into, despite

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.920
what you may think, because our website's out of date and all that stuff, we put a lot

02:37:55.920 --> 02:37:59.640
of fucking effort into this station that nobody listens to.

02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:04.320
But we do it anyway because it's fun.

02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:07.800
When we have all these, so obviously we have some very strong opinions about DDR.

02:38:07.800 --> 02:38:13.000
And when DDR starts to go in a direction that we don't like, we not get a little bit.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:16.380
It's just like when Star Wars fans call Lucas an asshole because he does something they

02:38:16.380 --> 02:38:17.380
don't like.

02:38:17.380 --> 02:38:20.220
Obviously, when all is said and done, we fucking love Konami.

02:38:20.220 --> 02:38:23.540
Excuse me, there's a difference between Konami doing something we don't like and what Lucas

02:38:23.540 --> 02:38:24.540
did.

02:38:24.540 --> 02:38:26.060
Okay, I'm just trying to make a broad comparison.

02:38:26.060 --> 02:38:28.140
Obviously, we fucking love Konami.

02:38:28.140 --> 02:38:31.100
If it were not for Konami, we wouldn't have DDR, we wouldn't have all this great music.

02:38:31.100 --> 02:38:34.980
Konami Originals is some of the best music in DDR, but when they make bad decisions,

02:38:34.980 --> 02:38:39.820
we're going to call them on it because they're affecting a game that means a lot to us.

02:38:39.820 --> 02:38:41.740
So that's kind of the purpose behind this show.

02:38:41.740 --> 02:38:50.220
We slam DDR a lot on this show, but when all is said and done, we're only pointing out

02:38:50.220 --> 02:38:54.460
the flaws we see because the game means so much to us in the end.

02:38:54.460 --> 02:38:55.460
Okay.

02:38:55.460 --> 02:38:58.700
Let's see, what was the other comment?

02:38:58.700 --> 02:39:02.300
I want to be fair and kind of give the whole comments here.

02:39:02.300 --> 02:39:04.740
Some people commented that Konami doesn't care.

02:39:04.740 --> 02:39:09.180
Romani went to pretty good lengths to listen to what the Konami community wanted with the

02:39:09.180 --> 02:39:13.300
public beta test and the poll they made to see that people wanted back, which might be

02:39:13.300 --> 02:39:16.820
primarily responsible for seeing Rhythm Police again on a mix. Hey, if you listened to the

02:39:16.820 --> 02:39:23.020
show a couple weeks ago, I said Max 2 has the best licenses. They did listen to what

02:39:23.020 --> 02:39:26.700
the people want. People said We Want Heaven by DJ Yano. They put it on there. It's a pretty

02:39:26.700 --> 02:39:33.880
sweet song. So, you know, Konami of America doesn't completely fuck up one after another

02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:38.800
time. But it's just kind of like what's frustrating sometimes is that Konami, when they do things,

02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:41.440
They do it so well. Why won't they keep doing it?

02:39:42.680 --> 02:39:45.160
Why won't they make new mixes? Okay. Here's what?

02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:48.360
What

02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:55.120
What do you think I said? Okay. Here's what I don't understand. Okay, the whole the whole thing of DDR3 mode is like, yes

02:39:55.120 --> 02:39:59.320
They're going in the right direction. You know, they're they're getting input from the fans. No

02:40:00.600 --> 02:40:02.600
Come in

02:40:02.600 --> 02:40:09.600
Hello. Hi. Okay. So they're getting input from the fans and everything and they're like,

02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:13.600
oh yeah, we're starting over. We're doing this. And they're like, ha, no we're not.

02:40:13.600 --> 02:40:18.280
It's like giving the players blue balls. That's pretty much what it is. It's like you're getting

02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:21.880
them all psyched up for like this new thing. They're just going to keep going. Then they're

02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:27.800
like, no, we changed their minds. We don't really want to do that anymore. It's just

02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:36.680
are really annoying. They frustrate the players. All right. So, bottom line. Look at us. We're

02:40:36.680 --> 02:40:41.760
dorks. We don't care. Yes, we have a radio station dedicated to DDR and you know what?

02:40:41.760 --> 02:40:45.680
We like it that way because DDR has affected our lives so much. We feel the need to talk

02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:50.960
about it three hours a week, in some cases more with our spinoff shows. So when DDR does

02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:56.080
something we don't like, we're going to point it out. End of story. And we're going to give

02:40:56.080 --> 02:41:01.520
our kind suggestions in a comical way, because this is radio, and we want you people to have

02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:06.040
something to listen to. If we were just sitting here, well, I see that we're going to have

02:41:06.040 --> 02:41:10.900
the new Max 2 out in a couple months, and it would be boring. So obviously we've got

02:41:10.900 --> 02:41:13.160
to say things that are going to piss people off, because that's what radio is all about.

02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:15.760
It would be like watching Masterpiece Theater.

02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:21.300
Exactly. All right. I think we're done. But you know what? I welcome the counter opinions.

02:41:21.300 --> 02:41:25.160
I welcome that. So I don't want to sound like I'm singling a person out or yelling at somebody,

02:41:25.160 --> 02:41:30.980
because I welcome the other opinions. It's kind of fun. We just filled up a good 10 minutes

02:41:30.980 --> 02:41:37.400
right there. All right. Let's completely change topics and let's stop saying F-you to Bamani

02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:41.840
for a little bit. Oh, I have announced the winner of the Orange Lounge Cage Match. Holy

02:41:41.840 --> 02:41:46.680
Christ. We got so much on another tangent here that we didn't ever even announce the

02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:50.240
winner of the Orange Lounge Cage Match. Here it is, tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge

02:41:50.240 --> 02:41:55.980
cage match by quite a large margin, I must say, is coming from a person who I don't think

02:41:55.980 --> 02:41:57.880
has won the cage match in a while, Jamie.

02:41:57.880 --> 02:41:58.880
Your song won tonight.

02:41:58.880 --> 02:41:59.880
Yay.

02:41:59.880 --> 02:42:00.880
Good job.

02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:01.880
Cyber X with Little Flower.

02:42:01.880 --> 02:42:02.880
Thank you.

02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:03.880
Thank you.

02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:04.880
You love me.

02:42:04.880 --> 02:42:05.880
You all really love me.

02:42:05.880 --> 02:42:08.580
I feel like going ferret squee.

02:42:08.580 --> 02:42:09.580
So that's good.

02:42:09.580 --> 02:42:10.580
It's a good song.

02:42:10.580 --> 02:42:11.580
I'm glad it won.

02:42:11.580 --> 02:42:12.580
All right.

02:42:12.580 --> 02:42:13.580
Cool.

02:42:13.580 --> 02:42:14.580
So there's your winner for tonight's cage match.

02:42:14.580 --> 02:42:15.580
Sorry I didn't announce it earlier.

02:42:15.580 --> 02:42:16.580
We got kind of sidetracked.

02:42:16.580 --> 02:42:17.580
Woo hoo.

02:42:17.580 --> 02:42:18.580
Okay.

02:42:18.580 --> 02:42:19.580
That means I don't have to pick a song next week.

02:42:19.580 --> 02:42:22.060
There you go, there you go.

02:42:22.060 --> 02:42:27.140
We're going to get into the FUs of the Week, so we're going to stop saying FU to Bomani and we'll say FU to some other stuff real fast.

02:42:27.140 --> 02:42:31.520
So, Jamie, why don't you explain the FUs of the Week for those people who haven't listened before.

02:42:31.520 --> 02:42:38.520
This is where we get really pissed off and tell you about it.

02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:53.700
Um, first

02:42:53.700 --> 02:42:56.940
after he goes to my cough that will never go away

02:42:56.940 --> 02:42:59.080
I feel like I've been cursed

02:42:59.080 --> 02:43:09.040
So fuck my lungs and my nose for being trippy, although I really do like coding a whole lot.

02:43:09.040 --> 02:43:17.200
Another F.U. goes to being sick at work and then another F.U. goes toward the attitude

02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:21.200
of some of my co-workers that I'm contagious, which is absolute bullshit because it's just

02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:24.800
a sinus infection, which is bacteria.

02:43:24.800 --> 02:43:30.100
If you're going to get a fine of infection, you're going to get it.

02:43:30.100 --> 02:43:35.700
Another one goes toward not having any PTO left over after my trip from Alabama because

02:43:35.700 --> 02:43:42.500
I had to use half of what would have been my remainder going to the doctor.

02:43:42.500 --> 02:43:46.300
Another one goes toward my car still not being done yet, although they're making progress

02:43:46.300 --> 02:43:48.300
on it.

02:43:48.300 --> 02:43:58.300
The biggest one right now is this headache that just won't go away, so yeah, I'm done.

02:43:58.300 --> 02:44:00.300
Wow, that was pretty quick.

02:44:00.300 --> 02:44:03.300
That's because I'm in pain.

02:44:03.300 --> 02:44:09.300
Next up, Loki.

02:44:09.300 --> 02:44:13.300
I'm eating spaghetti, dry spaghetti.

02:44:13.300 --> 02:44:25.300
Anyways, um, I view the stupid drivers because you go too damn slow, especially when I have to yell at you and you don't hear me. That pisses me off too.

02:44:25.300 --> 02:44:33.300
So of course I should guess that you wouldn't hear me since my windows are down. But you should! You should see me angry and move out of my way.

02:44:33.300 --> 02:44:44.300
FU to Walmart for having a solo 2000 because solo sucks, so you suck.

02:44:44.300 --> 02:44:56.020
And FU to the DVD video that I had for calibrating my TV, it's very boring, so yeah, that sucks.

02:44:56.020 --> 02:45:02.300
I expect it to be exciting, exciting.

02:45:02.300 --> 02:45:07.300
In defense of that video, it did have the electrocution and the pyromaniacal arm.

02:45:08.300 --> 02:45:10.300
Okay, that was funny.

02:45:10.300 --> 02:45:15.300
F you to Rob for encouraging the old Chinese lady for giving people out samples.

02:45:15.300 --> 02:45:18.300
I had her trained really well. She wasn't going to give me a sample.

02:45:18.300 --> 02:45:20.300
You're the fucking go and ask for a sample.

02:45:20.300 --> 02:45:21.300
God damn it.

02:45:21.300 --> 02:45:22.300
What sample?

02:45:22.300 --> 02:45:38.300
F.U. the fact that we have to do these on Sunday because I'm more violent on Mondays when I'm pissed off at things, but now I calm down by the weekend. It's just not fair.

02:45:38.300 --> 02:45:44.300
I don't have much more to complain about.

02:45:44.300 --> 02:45:51.300
Oh yeah, F you to stupid high school whores because you suck and we know that you're going

02:45:51.300 --> 02:45:56.020
to get knocked open pregnant and have some STD and then like collect welfare so you suck

02:45:56.020 --> 02:45:57.020
in advance.

02:45:57.020 --> 02:45:58.020
I'm done.

02:45:58.020 --> 02:45:59.020
Alright.

02:45:59.020 --> 02:46:09.020
I would have to say I give an F you to this fucking driver who as I was you

02:46:09.020 --> 02:46:12.580
know I hate it when people as you're driving down the street they have to

02:46:12.580 --> 02:46:16.940
pull out of a lot right in front of you so you have to step on the brakes that

02:46:16.940 --> 02:46:21.380
is so fucked up when I have to slow down because you're an asshole and you can't

02:46:21.380 --> 02:46:30.220
both ways before you pull out of the parking lot. Fuck you! And I'm continuing FU to Comcast's

02:46:30.220 --> 02:46:33.500
worst cable company on the face of the Earth. Now they're fucking over a bunch of my friends.

02:46:33.500 --> 02:46:37.020
I've been reading a LiveJournal this week. Comcast has been taking people offline and

02:46:37.020 --> 02:46:43.300
all this stuff. And worse yet, it's spreading. It's worse than Gator. It's spreading like

02:46:43.300 --> 02:46:49.960
a disease. Oh, now it reminds me, FU to Lop.com, I'll let Loky give the rest of this. Lop.com

02:47:19.960 --> 02:47:24.960
Find the hidden link on there and then download their uninstall program and run it.

02:47:24.960 --> 02:47:26.960
It has the only way.

02:47:26.960 --> 02:47:29.960
Also, avoid the program No Adware.

02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:32.960
It's like called No Adware or something like that.

02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:35.960
It is Adware itself.

02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:36.960
Irony.

02:47:36.960 --> 02:47:39.960
I still vouch for the Seek and Destroy program.

02:47:39.960 --> 02:47:40.960
That's a good one.

02:47:40.960 --> 02:47:43.960
I've been using Adware as well, too.

02:47:43.960 --> 02:47:54.960
I have to use Attaware and then this one program called, oh I forget what it is, I stick with,

02:47:54.960 --> 02:47:59.120
I have about three different pop-up programs running at the same time to avoid any pop-ups

02:47:59.120 --> 02:48:03.000
and get some, still sneak through, so.

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.560
I'll tell you what, it's all about Mozilla.

02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:10.400
If it weren't slow as shit, Mozilla would be the best because you can block, the pop-up

02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:24.960
I have found though that I haven't had nearly as much crap get on my computer since I've

02:48:24.960 --> 02:48:30.600
been using the Google companion on Internet Explorer.

02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:37.000
It has the search engine, the pop-up blocker, and an individual word search by every title

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:38.480
that you've put in there.

02:48:38.480 --> 02:48:47.480
It's a very, very intelligent little companion, and it effectively blocks just about any pop-up that'll come through and anything that tries to install on your computer.

02:48:47.480 --> 02:48:53.480
It's very effective, so I recommend it. You can get it right on Google.com.

02:48:53.480 --> 02:48:57.480
Okay. Bradley, you have any FUs you want to give tonight?

02:48:57.480 --> 02:49:03.480
Oh, sure, sure. Fuck you to not having money, because that's why CalMPS had to take my stuff away.

02:49:03.480 --> 02:49:13.480
He actually had options for paying like 90 bucks or something, but I have like two payments on Monday that I just barely can cover, so I had to let him take it away.

02:49:13.480 --> 02:49:25.480
And it'll take me like two months to get it back if I can ever get to that. But anyway, and fuck you to not having money because there's Papa John's pizza ad right in front of me and it makes me hungry for it, but I can't really afford it.

02:49:25.480 --> 02:49:29.480
He can turn it over if it helps.

02:49:29.480 --> 02:49:31.480
Are you gonna buy Bradley pizza?

02:49:31.480 --> 02:49:33.480
I got Bradley pizza one day.

02:50:01.480 --> 02:50:08.480
I try, I try not, I make it sometimes but I don't, I don't tell people about it.

02:50:08.480 --> 02:50:11.480
Just, he's trying to be funny and he's not, just ignore it.

02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:14.480
Yeah, well he, he's trying to be funny.

02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:17.480
He'll be funny if he does it in Portuguese.

02:50:17.480 --> 02:50:20.480
Miserably, miserably, terrible, horrible, he'll be very bad.

02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:26.480
And, ok, uh, and fuck you to that, cause then, then we're supposed to have like this, and then,

02:50:26.480 --> 02:50:33.480
And then she said, oh, so I messed it up, so I'll have like 11 AM on Thursday.

02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:42.480
And so then I think she called me at 11 AM her time, because I wasn't running at that time, but I couldn't get to it.

02:50:42.480 --> 02:50:51.480
And then now fuck you to Mailsweeper, because her company uses that, and it started thinking my emails were spam.

02:50:51.480 --> 02:51:01.480
So I tried like four or five different times to get through, and I kept from blocking him, so I still needed a caller to make sure that my last message got through, which didn't seem to be blocked.

02:51:01.480 --> 02:51:11.480
And hopefully it'll actually work out and actually talk to the person, and then they can reject me for not being full of the customer service skills that they probably want.

02:51:11.480 --> 02:51:15.480
Uh, let's see, what else? Anything else?

02:51:15.480 --> 02:51:18.480
Uh, fuck you, the chairs that make too much noise.

02:51:18.480 --> 02:51:25.480
Because, like, these hydraulic chairs, they're quite the first, and then they start making noise on me for some reason.

02:51:25.480 --> 02:51:32.480
And... and I'll wrap it up so people can get to the set room and finish it up.

02:51:32.480 --> 02:51:33.480
That's it then?

02:51:33.480 --> 02:51:34.480
Yeah.

02:51:34.480 --> 02:51:40.480
Alright. Let's move on to the chat room FUs, and fuckin' hey, there's a lot of them tonight.

02:51:40.480 --> 02:51:44.680
No Silence says, my F.U. of the week is those people that think they're cars, you know those

02:51:44.680 --> 02:51:48.000
people that ride the scooters and the motor ones, they get in front of you thinking they

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:49.000
belong there.

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:52.360
I go, get out of my way, you're not a bike, so go on the sidewalk.

02:51:52.360 --> 02:51:55.700
My next F.U. of the week is for my car not being fixed, again.

02:51:55.700 --> 02:51:58.960
My next F.U. of the week is spending over $100 for art supplies, again.

02:51:58.960 --> 02:52:01.880
F.U. for running out of ideas, I need more ideas.

02:52:01.880 --> 02:52:03.880
God I'm sick.

02:52:03.880 --> 02:52:10.880
They got cut off. God, I'm sick.

02:52:11.480 --> 02:52:13.380
EvilNauke2Dx says,

02:52:13.380 --> 02:52:19.640
My only F.U. this week is homework, and hi Nee-chan.

02:52:19.640 --> 02:52:20.880
Sorry, I'm a honky.

02:52:20.880 --> 02:52:25.840
Jazz says, I don't have an F.U. because I'm a happy little hoe. My F.U. is that I don't have an F.U.

02:52:25.840 --> 02:52:28.880
because I'm a happy little hoe.

02:52:28.880 --> 02:52:32.080
John Fields says, F you to humanity in general.

02:52:32.080 --> 02:52:34.860
Yeah, humans suck.

02:52:34.860 --> 02:52:36.960
Without humanity, you wouldn't exist.

02:52:36.960 --> 02:52:38.720
You'd be in a world of nothingness.

02:52:38.720 --> 02:52:40.440
You'd be a robot.

02:52:40.440 --> 02:52:42.200
23rd Magus says, F you to people who

02:52:42.200 --> 02:52:44.200
think they know it's in my head, and then proceed

02:52:44.200 --> 02:52:46.000
to put words in my mouth.

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.760
F you to Solo 2000, you suck, you don't deserve to exist,

02:52:48.760 --> 02:52:51.280
you are inferior, good day, sir.

02:52:51.280 --> 02:52:53.600
I disagree, 6th panel owns you, but whatever.

02:52:53.600 --> 02:52:55.840
You're entitled to your opinion, even if you're wrong.

02:52:55.840 --> 02:52:57.560
23rd Magus continues to say, fuck

02:52:57.560 --> 02:53:01.220
not getting a call back from either Radio Shack or Papa Murphy's. How hard is it to

02:53:01.220 --> 02:53:05.120
email me or leave a fucking message? Die, K, thanks, bye. When they don't call you,

02:53:05.120 --> 02:53:19.120
you call them. That's my advice. Wampa164 says, F you to teenage kids. They can't drive,

02:53:19.120 --> 02:53:23.720
but think they have and deserve more rights and have no respect for their elders anymore.

02:54:23.720 --> 02:54:28.520
the word ass hat. The word is lame and annoying in my opinion. Oh shit, I just said it. God,

02:54:28.520 --> 02:54:34.240
you're an ass hat. Stop being such an ass hat. You are wearing your ass as a hat. Stop

02:54:34.240 --> 02:54:43.000
being an ass hat. F you to the person who suggested switching vanilla sky with orange

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:48.400
lounge radio because I'm not coming in on Sunday evenings. You switch them. It was Monday

02:55:18.400 --> 02:55:42.400
I don't care, other folks don't care, so why the fuck do you have to scream about how I

02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:45.000
got 4 grades on 1998 Extra Stage?

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:46.000
Guess what?

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:47.640
I don't appreciate it, and I hope you get pregnant.

02:55:47.640 --> 02:55:52.240
No, because then that means there'll be more of them.

02:55:52.240 --> 02:55:56.840
Fat old fuck you goes to the nasty smelling shit logs that take my turn on initial D.

02:55:56.840 --> 02:56:00.000
Hey, how about I take a fucking broken bottle to your head, then we'll see how badly you

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:01.000
want my turn.

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.320
You suck shit anyway, and you don't deserve life to begin with.

02:56:03.320 --> 02:56:05.200
Wow, there's a lot of anger in here.

02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:11.240
I know it's initial D. Why are you getting concerned anyway?

02:56:11.240 --> 02:56:12.880
After his, I have another one.

02:56:12.880 --> 02:56:14.240
We're almost done.

02:56:14.240 --> 02:56:18.400
We're getting the last straggling FUs now, so that means I'm turning the music off because

02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:19.400
these are stragglers.

02:56:19.400 --> 02:56:27.960
Ewan Aoki 2DX has one last FU to his USB wireless adapter for blue-screening my system.

02:56:27.960 --> 02:56:31.600
And Wampa would also like to say, FU to MTV for being a piece of shit.

02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:36.200
They don't even play music but brainwash our youth and corrupt them to shit.

02:56:36.200 --> 02:56:40.640
Similarly, FU to the same teenage kids that can't drive but instead ride their shitty

02:56:40.640 --> 02:56:41.640
racer scooters.

02:56:41.640 --> 02:56:47.840
lastly F you to midterms from stapler X that's the last one no more I just

02:56:47.840 --> 02:56:55.760
wanted to add that I just forgot what I was gonna say way to go oh yeah I would

02:56:55.760 --> 02:57:00.440
it is a stupid bitch on the riding rock online community on live journal her

02:57:00.440 --> 02:57:06.280
account got banned and her husband's account got banned and you know for well

02:57:06.280 --> 02:57:09.880
the thing is they don't know and gravity's not replying back the thing is

02:57:09.880 --> 02:57:15.540
though I understand that I would be upset if my account were banned, you know.

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:20.600
But they didn't check, apparently she did not check the ban list to see

02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:23.720
if it was a temporary ban or a permanent ban.

02:57:24.140 --> 02:57:28.160
She did not stop to think that because they've recently been hacked,

02:57:29.060 --> 02:57:32.840
that this could be a maintenance issue and that their accounts will be reinstated once they've

02:57:32.920 --> 02:57:35.560
completed whatever it is that they're doing, you know.

02:57:35.560 --> 02:57:41.640
Instead, she's acting rude to everybody on the list, and acting like this is her life.

02:57:41.640 --> 02:57:44.120
It's a stupid game.

02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:50.040
So if you think we're assholes when it comes to DDR, go look at this community.

02:57:50.040 --> 02:57:51.040
I would be upset.

02:57:51.040 --> 02:57:56.960
Like I said, I'd be upset if I was unjustly banned, if I didn't do anything, but she was

02:57:56.960 --> 02:58:01.100
just being really rude and nasty to people with no reason to do it.

02:58:01.100 --> 02:58:07.300
And they were offering legitimate suggestions, things that she can do, the different solutions

02:58:07.300 --> 02:58:08.300
to her problem.

02:58:08.300 --> 02:58:13.700
But all that she wanted to do was bitch about the service, and she didn't even take any

02:58:13.700 --> 02:58:19.720
of the proper steps to be sure that it was indeed a true banning.

02:58:19.720 --> 02:58:22.340
Like I said, it didn't have to do with the maintenance or anything.

02:58:22.340 --> 02:58:24.000
This person was so stupid.

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:33.560
Just go to livejournal.com users slash ragnarokonline and it's probably one of the older ones now

02:58:33.560 --> 02:58:39.440
but she's a really stupid bitch and needs to be slapped inside her head.

02:58:39.440 --> 02:58:42.040
She doesn't deserve her ragnarok online anyway if she's not addicted to it.

02:58:42.040 --> 02:58:43.680
Are you going to slap her with your dick?

02:58:43.680 --> 02:58:45.880
I don't have one.

02:58:45.880 --> 02:58:46.880
If you had one.

02:58:46.880 --> 02:58:47.880
Your hypothetical dick.

02:58:47.880 --> 02:58:48.880
I would slap her.

02:58:48.880 --> 02:58:49.880
Your internet penis.

02:58:49.880 --> 02:58:52.280
would slap her with the Red Bull cock.

02:58:52.280 --> 02:58:55.120
All right.

02:58:55.120 --> 02:58:57.600
Speaking of LiveJournal, Orange Lounge

02:58:57.600 --> 02:59:00.000
has a LiveJournal community that is posted every once

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:01.160
in a great while.

02:59:01.160 --> 02:59:04.400
Hey, well, actually, we've got quite a few people watching it.

02:59:04.400 --> 02:59:07.240
Well, there's some news and some questions

02:59:07.240 --> 02:59:09.920
that get asked on there.

02:59:09.920 --> 02:59:13.240
It's a username, Orange Lounge, all one word.

02:59:13.240 --> 02:59:15.040
And there is a DDR one.

02:59:15.040 --> 02:59:20.280
It's actually the live journal community, Bimani.

02:59:20.280 --> 02:59:23.040
I think there's also a DDR one, but it's kind of.

02:59:23.040 --> 02:59:24.000
No one updates it.

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:24.880
Yeah, it's kind of.

02:59:24.880 --> 02:59:26.720
Just look for the Bimani one.

02:59:26.720 --> 02:59:31.480
And on Dead Journal, there's DDR Maniacs.

02:59:31.480 --> 02:59:34.120
Oh, pretty cool.

02:59:34.120 --> 02:59:35.600
Well, we're winding down the show here.

02:59:35.600 --> 02:59:37.140
We're getting into the home stretch.

02:59:37.140 --> 02:59:38.760
Loki, is there anything we missed?

02:59:38.760 --> 02:59:40.800
You and I had tons of topics we wanted to talk about tonight.

02:59:40.800 --> 02:59:43.300
Is there any last minute things we had we forgot to talk about?

02:59:43.300 --> 02:59:44.360
We did the UPN story.

02:59:44.360 --> 02:59:50.480
We did the ranting about the bootleg machines and the new games and all that stuff.

02:59:50.480 --> 02:59:51.600
He's thinking.

02:59:51.600 --> 02:59:58.720
He's off in La La Land.

02:59:58.720 --> 02:59:59.720
Altar Makes Go is gold.

02:59:59.720 --> 03:00:01.080
I thought that's kind of old news.

03:00:01.080 --> 03:00:02.080
I don't know.

03:00:02.080 --> 03:00:04.200
Altar Makes comes out on the 18th of November and-

03:00:04.200 --> 03:00:06.200
That's going to be when I'm in-

03:00:06.200 --> 03:00:07.200
No, I think I'll be-

03:00:07.200 --> 03:00:09.840
Don't you come back right about then?

03:00:09.840 --> 03:00:12.200
I need to look at a calendar.

03:00:12.200 --> 03:00:13.200
I think so.

03:00:13.200 --> 03:00:17.200
that's about the time I'm going to be back. Oh, oh, oh, I have happy news.

03:00:17.200 --> 03:00:21.200
Okay. Oh, God, that hurt. For old-school gamers.

03:00:21.200 --> 03:00:27.200
Okay. There is, for anyone who remembers on the Sega Saturn, the Sega Ages collection,

03:00:27.200 --> 03:00:33.200
where they were, well, in the U.S. they released multiple games on one disc,

03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:38.200
but in Japan they were, each game was released individually, like Space Harrier, you know, all this.

03:00:38.200 --> 03:00:44.200
Well, they're doing Sega Ages 2500, which basically, for the PS2, it's remakes of old

03:00:44.200 --> 03:00:53.260
Sega games that were supposed to sell for 2,500 yen, about 23 something, and they've

03:00:53.260 --> 03:01:00.280
released Space Harrier, which I ordered, Fantasy Zone, which is my second favorite game ever,

03:01:00.280 --> 03:01:05.880
and so I ordered that too, Fantasy Star, which is a really nice remake, those are the three

03:01:05.880 --> 03:01:06.880
that I ordered.

03:01:06.880 --> 03:01:12.200
that are out right now is Monaco GP and Goldnax.

03:01:13.320 --> 03:01:15.000
So the best prices I've seen

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:21.320
for our most reliable site is toysnjoys.com, T-O-Y-S-N-J-O-Y-S dot com.

03:01:21.740 --> 03:01:22.820
They're located in Hawaii.

03:01:22.820 --> 03:01:23.720
They have really fast shipping.

03:01:24.280 --> 03:01:26.340
And they're selling it for 25 bucks.

03:01:27.040 --> 03:01:31.720
So, but that, I just had to make the mention for all the old school people

03:01:31.720 --> 03:01:33.160
because it's really neat that they're doing that.

03:01:33.160 --> 03:01:40.040
Oh, what, Logie? Come say that on the mic, because that's big news to me, because that

03:01:40.040 --> 03:01:43.740
kind of is an epilogue to something we were talking about just a minute ago.

03:01:43.740 --> 03:01:47.320
Euromix 3 is coming out next year, early spring, I think.

03:01:47.320 --> 03:01:52.280
So at least somewhere, someone is continuing to do DDR. Some Konami company is continuing

03:01:52.280 --> 03:01:56.600
to do DDR. That's a good sign. So is Europe doing DDR the way it needs to be done?

03:01:56.600 --> 03:01:57.600
I don't know.

03:01:57.600 --> 03:02:00.520
Well, the only thing that I've heard about it is that Wannabes is going to be on it.

03:02:00.520 --> 03:02:01.520
That was one of the tracks.

03:02:01.520 --> 03:02:02.520
Joy of joys.

03:02:02.520 --> 03:02:06.980
Well, it doesn't matter. It's just it's a song that's in DDR. It's a new mix

03:02:06.980 --> 03:02:11.140
Yeah, but is that is that some fanboys wet dream or is that something has actually been documented somewhere?

03:02:11.140 --> 03:02:13.140
It's like is that announced somewhere has announced

03:02:14.660 --> 03:02:16.660
DDR UK is all over it

03:02:17.160 --> 03:02:19.860
So because I believe anything they say

03:02:20.940 --> 03:02:23.760
Well, they're pretty on top of it for your mix. Yeah

03:02:23.760 --> 03:02:27.560
For most DDR news sites, they're pretty respectable.

03:02:27.560 --> 03:02:30.080
Yeah, I mean, they've got the UK end covered.

03:02:33.120 --> 03:02:37.000
But let's see.

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:38.800
Well, if that's all the news you've got,

03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:41.080
I guess we can go ahead and wrap up the show here.

03:02:41.080 --> 03:02:44.200
Yeah, that's all the news I can think of.

03:02:44.200 --> 03:02:46.960
All right, let's go around and see what everybody's.

03:02:46.960 --> 03:02:48.480
Oh, and Jamie would like this.

03:02:48.480 --> 03:02:51.160
They're selling second mix machines on eBay right now,

03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:53.040
a couple of them.

03:02:53.040 --> 03:02:56.640
I don't remember it wasn't like $4,000 with some insane amount you get an

03:02:56.640 --> 03:02:57.560
extreme gain for.

03:02:57.720 --> 03:02:58.000
Yeah.

03:02:58.240 --> 03:03:02.000
Well, the thing is, is that, and Dan and I have sat down, talked to that,

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:04.480
what made it official, we're buying our house in the spring.

03:03:05.320 --> 03:03:08.560
Um, actually next, uh, next spring we're buying our house.

03:03:08.560 --> 03:03:10.840
We will have a house and we will have a DVR machine.

03:03:11.400 --> 03:03:14.000
So, um, but the thing is, we're probably going to have an extreme.

03:03:14.680 --> 03:03:15.840
Why not a second mix?

03:03:16.360 --> 03:03:18.600
Because you can't grade a second mix.

03:03:20.160 --> 03:03:21.240
Get bootleg third.

03:03:21.240 --> 03:03:23.120
Get a third Korean, third Korean.

03:03:23.120 --> 03:03:24.880
No, I do not want the third.

03:03:24.880 --> 03:03:27.400
If I get a third mix, it's going to be a third plus.

03:03:27.400 --> 03:03:28.240
Whatever.

03:03:28.240 --> 03:03:29.480
All right.

03:03:29.480 --> 03:03:31.480
OK, let's go around to Garibay's final thought.

03:03:31.480 --> 03:03:32.480
Now the show's wrapping up.

03:03:32.480 --> 03:03:33.580
Bradley, we'll start with Bradley,

03:03:33.580 --> 03:03:34.960
our guest for this evening.

03:03:34.960 --> 03:03:37.400
Wasn't said much, but that's OK.

03:03:37.400 --> 03:03:40.040
That's what he's known for.

03:03:40.040 --> 03:03:42.040
All right.

03:03:42.040 --> 03:03:43.320
Be active, not passive.

03:03:43.320 --> 03:03:47.320
Let my performance today be an example of what not to do.

03:03:47.320 --> 03:03:52.000
Okay, final thought.

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:53.960
I'm going to be done with my cabinet this week.

03:03:53.960 --> 03:03:56.320
Didn't you say that last week?

03:03:56.320 --> 03:03:57.960
No, really this time.

03:03:57.960 --> 03:03:58.960
I'm on last.

03:03:58.960 --> 03:03:59.960
No, no, really.

03:03:59.960 --> 03:04:00.960
I swear I'm going to be done.

03:04:00.960 --> 03:04:06.840
Well, with part of it at least, I'll be done with the major cutting of the cabinet.

03:04:06.840 --> 03:04:11.920
Will we actually have a wooden empty cabinet at the end of this week?

03:04:11.920 --> 03:04:12.920
Possibly.

03:04:12.920 --> 03:04:16.680
I'm thinking battery power is the only thing stopping me.

03:04:16.680 --> 03:04:23.820
I have, like, all the sheets I have left to cut are just rectangular, so, I mean, it's

03:04:23.820 --> 03:04:28.260
not anything complex or anything. And then it's just putting it together. That's pretty

03:04:28.260 --> 03:04:35.360
much it. You know, it's not much left. So, maybe. Maybe we'll have a cabinet by the end

03:04:35.360 --> 03:04:46.140
of the week. Who knows? I'll be waiting. Jamie, your final thought. Ow! My final thought

03:04:46.140 --> 03:04:51.780
That is, I'm so happy I only have to work two days next week.

03:04:51.780 --> 03:04:52.780
That makes me giddy.

03:04:52.780 --> 03:04:54.900
And you don't have to work a full week.

03:04:54.900 --> 03:04:57.540
I wouldn't exactly call what I do work, but sure.

03:04:57.540 --> 03:05:00.660
I get two weeks off in a row, huh?

03:05:00.660 --> 03:05:01.660
Blimey.

03:05:01.660 --> 03:05:02.940
All right.

03:05:02.940 --> 03:05:03.940
That's it.

03:05:03.940 --> 03:05:04.940
Final word of the show tonight.

03:05:04.940 --> 03:05:08.620
Nellie, you want to take a stab at one word, Nellie?

03:05:08.620 --> 03:05:10.260
Can you say one word?

03:05:10.260 --> 03:05:11.260
Just one?

03:05:11.260 --> 03:05:12.260
No.

03:05:12.260 --> 03:05:17.980
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:05:17.980 --> 03:05:22.140
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Skye and Loki.

03:05:22.140 --> 03:05:24.500

03:05:24.500 --> 03:05:31.500
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:05:54.500 --> 03:06:15.820
Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.

03:06:24.500 --> 03:06:49.660
Orange Lounge Radio, the after birth, the part after the credits have faded out.

03:06:49.660 --> 03:06:54.420
We'll add a little bit of WTF to tonight's fortune cookie, Jamie.

03:06:54.420 --> 03:06:56.060
Explain yourself.

03:06:56.060 --> 03:07:00.780
I was going through my waves and I could not decide on one, so I picked the Sailor Stars

03:07:00.780 --> 03:07:07.720
transformation from the last season of Sailor Moon in Japanese, of course, which I actually

03:07:07.720 --> 03:07:13.480
thought was a pretty good series because they killed Chibusa, except they brought in Chibi

03:07:13.480 --> 03:07:15.980
Chibi and she needed to die too.

03:07:15.980 --> 03:07:24.380
Yes, I was a Sailor Moon fan once when it was like new, but...

03:07:24.380 --> 03:07:26.500
I watched a couple episodes of it once.

03:07:26.500 --> 03:07:28.820
You watched the crap version.

03:07:28.820 --> 03:07:29.940
I have like...

03:07:29.940 --> 03:07:35.180
I can show you some quality Sailor Moon.

03:07:35.180 --> 03:07:36.620
I just...

03:07:36.620 --> 03:07:39.660
The quality Sailor Moon, isn't that a bit of a...

03:07:39.660 --> 03:07:40.660
No.

03:07:40.660 --> 03:07:44.460
I like Tuxedo Mask.

03:07:44.460 --> 03:07:48.620
coming but the guy they have playing them in the live-action series is ugly

03:07:48.620 --> 03:07:56.060
he's ugly I don't care what our bales we say he's ugly all right anything else

03:07:56.060 --> 03:07:58.260
you guys want to say in this little portion after the credits have faded

03:07:58.260 --> 03:08:14.620
here. Ow. My head hurts. I smell like sawdust. At least you don't have pea beef. Beef, beef.

03:08:14.620 --> 03:08:21.560
Did your pee smell like beef tonight? Or pork? No. It's just the beef soup. That's like that

03:08:21.560 --> 03:08:35.560

03:10:10.360 --> 03:10:17.360
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry I just want you to stay

03:10:40.360 --> 03:11:05.360
I just want you to stay in my arms

03:11:10.360 --> 03:11:35.360
Everybody needs a little time away

03:11:35.360 --> 03:11:45.360
Far away from nature.

03:11:45.360 --> 03:11:51.360
Even lovers need a holiday.

03:11:51.360 --> 03:11:57.360
Far away from nature.

03:11:57.360 --> 03:12:08.360
Ooh, now it's time for me to say I'm sorry I just want you to stay

03:12:57.360 --> 03:13:19.640
Do you believe in destiny, and close my eyes and dream that you are closer to me?

03:13:19.640 --> 03:13:33.640
So follow me, and you will see, together we can touch the sky, we're flying so high, high, high.

03:13:49.640 --> 03:14:14.640
I'm free in the light of the night Until the morning sky

03:14:14.640 --> 03:14:20.640
I feel alive tonight

03:14:21.640 --> 03:14:27.640
I feel the morning light

03:14:30.640 --> 03:14:33.640
Do you believe?

03:14:38.640 --> 03:14:40.640
Is this the thing?

03:14:40.640 --> 03:14:47.640
I know you need to be with me

03:14:47.640 --> 03:14:54.640
When something feels so good, it's only about the me

03:14:54.640 --> 03:15:00.640
As time goes by, I wonder why

03:15:00.640 --> 03:15:07.640
When you will be here with me someday, I'll fade anyway

03:15:20.640 --> 03:15:26.640
I'm free and alive and blind

03:15:26.640 --> 03:15:33.640
I'm still the morning sky

03:15:33.640 --> 03:15:40.640
I'm free like the sky

03:15:40.640 --> 03:15:48.640
I'm still the morning sky

03:15:48.640 --> 03:15:51.640
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody

03:15:51.640 --> 03:15:54.640

03:16:24.640 --> 03:16:34.640
Yeah, I wanna dance, dance, dance with somebody.

03:16:34.640 --> 03:16:40.640
Somebody to love me.

03:17:19.640 --> 03:17:22.640

Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody

Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody

The whole thing is all love

03:17:35.640 --> 03:17:37.640
I need a man who takes a chance

03:17:37.640 --> 03:17:41.640
On a love that burns high enough to last

03:17:41.640 --> 03:17:43.640
And when the night falls

03:17:43.640 --> 03:17:47.640
My lonely heart calls

03:17:47.640 --> 03:17:55.940
I wanna dance with somebody I wanna turn my feet with somebody

03:17:56.940 --> 03:18:03.040
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody With somebody who loves me

03:18:04.040 --> 03:18:08.440
I wanna dance with somebody I wanna turn my feet with somebody

03:18:08.440 --> 03:18:15.440
Yeah, we dance with somebody, with somebody who loves me

03:18:29.440 --> 03:18:34.440
I could see the way, just to hear you breathing

03:18:34.440 --> 03:18:41.440
Watch you smile while you are sleeping, while you're far away dreaming

03:18:41.440 --> 03:18:47.440
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender

03:18:47.440 --> 03:18:54.440
I could stay lost in this moment forever

03:18:54.440 --> 03:19:02.440
Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

03:19:02.440 --> 03:19:06.440
I don't want to close my eyes

03:19:06.440 --> 03:19:08.440
I don't want to fall asleep

03:19:08.440 --> 03:19:10.440
But I miss you baby

03:19:10.440 --> 03:19:13.440
And I don't want to miss a thing

03:19:13.440 --> 03:19:16.440
Cause even when I dream of you

03:19:16.440 --> 03:19:18.440
The sweetest dream would never do

03:19:18.440 --> 03:19:20.440
I still miss you baby

03:19:20.440 --> 03:19:24.440
And I don't want to feel the same

03:19:35.440 --> 03:19:41.440
Flying close to you, feeling your heart beating

03:19:41.440 --> 03:19:44.440
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming

03:19:44.440 --> 03:19:48.440
Wondering if there's me you're seeing

03:19:48.440 --> 03:19:54.440
Then I kiss your eyes, and thank God we're together

03:19:54.440 --> 03:20:00.440
And I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever

03:20:00.440 --> 03:20:02.440
Forever and ever

03:20:02.440 --> 03:20:05.440
I don't wanna close my eyes

03:20:05.440 --> 03:20:09.440
I don't wanna fall asleep cause I'll catch you baby

03:20:09.440 --> 03:20:12.440
And I don't wanna miss a thing

03:20:12.440 --> 03:20:15.440
Even when I dream of you

03:20:15.440 --> 03:20:41.960
I don't want to miss one smile I don't want to miss one kiss

03:20:41.960 --> 03:20:48.960
Cause I just wanna be with you, right here with you, just like this

03:20:48.960 --> 03:20:55.960
I just wanna hold you close, feel your heart go close to mine

03:20:55.960 --> 03:21:02.960
And just stay here in this moment for all the rest of time

03:21:02.960 --> 03:21:06.960
Yeah, yeah, oh!

Part of the way that I said

There's nothing else to compare

03:30:15.340 --> 03:30:19.340
The thought of you leaves me weak

03:30:19.340 --> 03:30:22.340

And I said, hey, hey hey!

03:32:42.160 --> 03:32:44.900

03:32:44.900 --> 03:32:45.620

What's going on?

03:33:18.640 --> 03:33:21.640
35 years of my life in the steel.

03:33:21.640 --> 03:33:27.120
I'm trying to get up the crappy hill of hope.

03:33:27.120 --> 03:33:31.620
For a destination.

03:33:31.620 --> 03:33:34.420
I realized quickly when I knew I should

03:33:34.420 --> 03:33:36.720
That the world was made up of this

03:33:36.720 --> 03:33:38.720
Fatherhood of hands

03:33:40.420 --> 03:33:42.420
Over there that dreams

03:33:44.420 --> 03:33:47.720
Into the quiet sun, I'll shine a light for friends

03:33:47.720 --> 03:33:51.020
But to get it all up was in my head

03:33:51.020 --> 03:33:55.620
And I, I'm feeling a little superior

03:33:57.620 --> 03:34:00.820
Into the wind in the morning and at the first night

03:34:00.820 --> 03:34:04.220
And I take a deep breath, and I can't breathe higher

03:34:04.220 --> 03:34:06.820
And I can't go back all my life

03:34:06.820 --> 03:34:08.820
What's going on?

03:34:09.820 --> 03:34:14.820
And I said, hey, yeah, yeah

03:34:14.820 --> 03:34:16.820
Hey, yeah, yeah

03:34:16.820 --> 03:34:18.820
I said, hey

03:34:18.820 --> 03:34:22.820
What's going on?

03:34:36.820 --> 03:34:41.820
And I try, oh my god, I try

03:34:41.820 --> 03:34:45.820
I try all the time

03:34:45.820 --> 03:34:49.820
In this institution

03:34:49.820 --> 03:34:51.820
And I pray

03:34:51.820 --> 03:34:54.820
What am I going to bring?

03:34:54.820 --> 03:34:58.820
I pray for a single day

03:34:58.820 --> 03:35:02.820
For a little desire

03:35:02.820 --> 03:35:06.820
Into the questions of the life I've made

03:35:06.820 --> 03:35:09.820
Just to get it all that was in my head

03:35:09.820 --> 03:35:12.820
And I, I feel

03:35:12.820 --> 03:35:14.820
A little easier

03:35:16.820 --> 03:35:19.820
Until I wake in the morning and I step outside

03:35:19.820 --> 03:35:22.820
And I take back the questions that I can't resound

03:35:22.820 --> 03:35:25.820
And I scream from above and I say

03:35:25.820 --> 03:35:27.820
What's going on?

03:35:28.820 --> 03:35:29.820
And I said

03:35:29.820 --> 03:35:33.820
Hey, yeah, yeah

03:35:33.820 --> 03:35:35.820
Hey, yeah, yeah

03:35:35.820 --> 03:35:37.820
I said hey

03:35:38.820 --> 03:35:40.820
What's going on?

03:35:40.820 --> 03:35:49.820
Can't touch this.

03:35:49.820 --> 03:35:56.820
Can't touch this.

03:35:56.820 --> 03:36:04.820
Can't touch this.

03:36:04.820 --> 03:36:22.940
You can't touch this.

03:36:22.940 --> 03:36:29.940
You can't touch this.
