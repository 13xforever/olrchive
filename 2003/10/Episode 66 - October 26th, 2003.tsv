990150	991811	Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.
991831	1001757	There's a whole shitload of people there tonight just waiting to talk to you and tell you where our webcam's at if you want to stare at us, although Jamie never is on cam.
1001918	1003699	Remember, $2.99 a minute.
1005320	1007601	We might talk to you in other ways.
1007641	1008002	I don't know.
1008942	1010003	I charge for my PMs.
1013085	1021133	And that's the only way you can vote in the cage match and also send your FUs of the week and all that stuff.
1023516	1025638	So, hello.
1028379	1036787	So for those of you guys that listen to the show on a regular basis, I'm sure you've heard Loki in the past talk about his experiences when he goes to Raley's to get Chinese food.
1037388	1042473	And the lady that works at the Raley's department that always says, Do you want a sample?
1043454	1046337	Yes, the sample lady at the Raley's.
1046998	1049120	And I had the chance today, Loki and I...
1050049	1056313	Loki and I went down to Walmart today to run some errands and do something else that we're going to talk about much later in the show.
1057634	1061937	We went to Walmart and then we went over to Rayleigh's to get some dinner because I was going to get some Chinese food.
1062498	1065760	And Loki said, hey, this is the Rayleigh's where the sample lady works at.
1065780	1071023	And I was all excited because I didn't realize that we were going to the Rayleigh's where the sample lady works at because I always thought she worked at another one.
1071404	1074566	Rayleigh's, for those who don't know, because I forget, it's probably only in California.
1074606	1075847	It's a big grocery store chain.
1076147	1077428	So Rayleigh's is a big grocery store.
1077928	1080909	and this is the most fucked up Raley's I've ever seen.
1080949	1082690	This Raley's here in Folsom where we live.
1083010	1085291	We have the Rainbow Cafe.
1085832	1088473	First of all, when you walk right in the door, the Rainbow Cafe.
1088533	1092414	It sounds like something that belongs in Lavender Heights in Midtown.
1093175	1098897	So you have the Rainbow Cafe when you walk through the door and then right next to the Rainbow Cafe is the takeout place.
1098917	1099798	What do they call it?
1099818	1100278	The Hot Walk.
1101406	1101846	A hot walk.
1101866	1105549	And so Loki and I walk in and Loki's like, Oh my God, the sample lady's working today.
1106349	1107269	That's her, that's her.
1107330	1109071	So I got all excited because I saw the sample lady.
1109471	1115394	And of course, since I saw the sample lady, there was nothing I wanted more than to hear her go, You want sample?
1116555	1116755	Yes.
1117095	1119176	So Loki gets up there and orders his food.
1119557	1121137	And shockingly enough, she didn't say it.
1121598	1122338	She didn't say it to him.
1122638	1126961	So I was starting to get all upset because I'm like, I can't be here and not hear the you want sample thing.
1127381	1128622	So I went up there and I was like,
1129781	1132662	Hi, um, yeah, can I try a little bit of the garlic chicken?
1133022	1133962	You know, and try an egg rind.
1134002	1134742	Oh, you want sample?
1135122	1135702	It didn't work.
1136003	1136903	She didn't say anything.
1136943	1140224	She just kind of like gave it to me and then got my meal and we were gone.
1140684	1143024	But there was this really stupid guy that was there too.
1143584	1149466	And, um, you know, after I took my garlic chicken and I ate the little thing because they put it on a toothpick, they put a piece on toothpick so you need it.
1149506	1151686	He's like, so was it good?
1153267	1153787	I'm just like,
1155481	1156743	Thank you for watching!
1173922	1176124	People don't think that you're weird.
1176224	1176504	Eat me.
1177385	1180127	Anyway, so I didn't get to hear the You Want Sample thing.
1180187	1186012	And then the lady who was checking us out, she looked like a brunette Donatella Versace, which kind of scared me a little bit, you know?
1186032	1187453	Oh my God, that woman is... Get out!
1187934	1189415	That woman is hideous looking.
1190956	1192357	She looks like Droopy.
1193438	1196061	Welcome to Donatella Versace's Halloween party.
1196881	1199223	I give you candy cigarettes.
1199503	1201105	Here's some candy, here's some cigarettes.
1202096	1204477	God, I love when they impersonate Donatello Versace on Saturday Night Live.
1204517	1208258	Anyway, so the lady who chipped us out looked like Donatello Versace.
1208638	1213520	And then there were these two kids that were like trying to play in one of those power wheelchairs.
1213560	1218361	You know how like if you're handicapped and you go to the grocery store, they give you like a complimentary wheelchair to sit in?
1218841	1220322	What a complimentary wheelchair.
1220342	1223763	There were these kids, and I swear to God, they were about ready to ram right into all the candy.
1223803	1224183	It was funny.
1226007	1229529	But I'm really upset because I didn't get to hear the you want sample thing, so I just have to rely on Loki.
1231610	1233111	Loki is the only one that can do it.
1234152	1240335	And then he had to go, like, I'm trying to train her not to offer the samples, because she does it at the wrong times.
1240355	1244718	It's like, you already get your food, you know, she's already given it to you, it's all ready to go.
1245058	1251222	Like, I got sweet and sour pork, and then she'll, like, give me a sample of sweet and sour pork, like, gee, I didn't know what it tasted like.
1251762	1254044	Oh my god, that's so good, maybe I should get some.
1254224	1255365	Oh wait, I already did.
1255385	1257807	You know, it's like, she's so retarded.
1257847	1263351	And then this other, on Friday, they had a person that was even dumber than she was, this old guy.
1263431	1265113	He was like, oh, you want food?
1265173	1265833	You want Chinese?
1266574	1267855	What kind of rice do you want?
1268115	1270637	And it's like, so fucking annoying.
1270837	1271878	They're so slow.
1272499	1274460	They like operate in another dimension.
1275161	1276242	They operate in the fast path.
1276262	1277082	Friggin' old.
1278543	1278964	But, um...
1280194	1281155	Yeah, they sucked.
1281275	1285138	And then Rob had to go and ask for a sample, and now she thinks it's okay to ask for samples.
1285478	1287560	And then she went back to asking people for samples.
1287700	1288640	God damn it.
1289981	1291142	You messed it all up for me.
1292003	1294805	I swear to God she recognized you when we walked in there.
1294885	1298648	We walked in, and she looked at you with that, hi, look on her face.
1298788	1300129	I was kind of like, oh.
1300569	1302451	She recognizes Loki as a frequent customer.
1302811	1305693	But what was so weird is right before you went up there to get help...
1307374	1309375	She started, like, staring off into space.
1309435	1311835	Like, she was staring at some person on the other end of the store.
1312155	1315076	And mind you, there's a line of, like, five people there waiting at the counter.
1315116	1316997	She's just like... She's looking at her ancestors.
1317017	1318297	She's staring off into space.
1318377	1322038	Yeah, like, you know, she's seeing the ghost of Christmas past in front of her or something.
1322098	1322998	It's fucking crazy.
1323878	1329900	So... But, you know, the woman's entertaining, so I'll continue to patronize that, Ray Lee.
1330000	1332361	For nothing else than good stories to fill up time on Orange Radio.
1332381	1333921	I have plenty of things I could patronize.
1336696	1338978	Anyway, um... Completely different sense.
1340379	1343741	Let's start off the lovely show with How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?
1343801	1347183	Our favorite way of letting you know what's going on in our lives.
1348304	1349925	It sounds like Jamie wants to start.
1350526	1352187	Oh, God, that gives me a headache.
1352507	1354268	Jamie, how was your past two weeks?
1354789	1356870	You were out last week for sickness.
1356950	1357731	Oh, my God.
1357751	1358771	Okay, Thursday.
1359112	1360432	Wait, how long have you been sick now?
1360492	1361173	Like three weeks?
1361653	1361913	No.
1362014	1362614	Do you have SARS?
1363074	1363515	No.
1363535	1363575	No.
1364730	1373134	No, I was, I was starting to get sick around Wednesday-ish, and Thursday, um, Dan's like, hey, let's go out and have dinner and shit, and so I'm like, okay.
1373154	1374414	Wait, you had dinner and shit?
1374614	1375055	Shut up.
1375655	1376915	Everything makes you shit.
1378056	1378396	Anyway.
1378676	1379116	Not soup.
1383158	1384339	With my digestion.
1385479	1385840	Anyway.
1385960	1386320	Alright.
1387460	1389921	It could be like chunky, creamy cheese soup or something.
1389981	1390562	Moving on!
1390582	1391162	Anyway.
1392002	1392342	Anyway.
1396614	1398915	I'm sorry, could you repeat that revelation for our listeners?
1400115	1403116	The beef soup makes your urine smell like beef.
1404477	1405197	It's a fact.
1405297	1406477	It's just like honey smacks.
1406817	1409738	Honey smacks makes your urine smell like honey smacks.
1412319	1413580	It's quite fascinating.
1416921	1418361	Honeycomb, honeycomb, we want honeycomb.
1419661	1420782	A honeycomb doesn't do anything.
1420942	1423523	It's just honey smacks and beef soup.
1423663	1424103	I don't know.
1425689	1429432	Oh, it's also like the blue Hawaiian punch makes you urine green.
1429472	1430092	It's kind of weird.
1431473	1438058	So, like, if you were to eat, like, beef soup with honey smacks on the side, would your, like, urine turn into this sudden, like, stink bomb?
1438118	1441120	Like, you could just, like, you know, whip it out?
1441220	1441680	Pow!
1442501	1444122	Hey, what about my week?
1445403	1445723	Sorry.
1446083	1446704	Okay.
1447264	1448865	Freaking piss sniffers.
1451047	1451447	Okay.
1451907	1452508	Okay.
1455045	1461728	Maybe it's different for a woman because you sit when you pee so you don't really smell it because it's kind of contained in the potty, right?
1461748	1462408	The smell is right.
1462608	1466310	But when you're a guy, you're whipping it out and you pee right there.
1466970	1469712	What?
1470152	1472393	I'm just saying.
1472433	1472953	I'm just saying.
1472973	1473814	You can't help it.
1474294	1474554	What?
1474814	1478716	Shut the fuck up.
1478756	1480977	I seriously think that's why some guys sit when they pee.
1483462	1484103	Okay.
1484283	1486725	Everyone here in the studio does have their pants on.
1487425	1489066	I don't know what the hell they're talking about.
1489967	1490788	We can fix that.
1491848	1493850	Hey now, what the hell is that big black scratch?
1493870	1496452	I don't know, Bradley sort of looks like he's not wearing pants in the webcam.
1496772	1497893	Your head's in the cam.
1500034	1500575	Sorry, Jamie.
1504458	1504998	You okay?
1505498	1506819	You sure you want to talk about your week here?
1507220	1507520	Okay.
1508381	1510222	You want something to drink?
1510542	1511323	You want some honey smacks?
1512744	1512844	Ouch!
1515518	1518540	I had beef soup, but now all I have is, like, chicken soup.
1518600	1526986	Okay, fucking go in the bathroom and take a pee right now, because I'm sick of hearing about your urine, okay?
1528887	1529347	Okay?
1531309	1536132	If you have to pee, stop talking about it, just get in the bathroom and pee.
1537353	1541676	We have so many Jamie quotes in, like, the past, like, two minutes right there to use in the next intro.
1543653	1546535	Not to mention that the blue light turns your stool green also.
1546555	1550258	You are in the perfect position for me to just knock you right out of your chair.
1551479	1552400	Actually, that would be my chair.
1553861	1555002	Knock you right out of Loki's chair.
1555282	1555442	Okay.
1555742	1558364	And you, I could throw the ferret at you, but that's too much effort.
1559185	1559385	Yeah.
1559585	1559865	Anyway.
1560766	1561206	How was your week?
1561226	1561646	How was your day?
1562187	1564829	I had two weeks, and I was sick the whole time.
1566110	1566210	It's...
1569969	1573951	I guess as everyone can tell, I still have this nasty cough.
1574672	1587618	And last week, when I called in, as you can probably vouch for this, I sounded really shitty, and I was getting dizzy in my chair, and I ran fever all weekend, I ran fever at work, but it's nothing that's like super contagious, it's a sinus infection.
1589439	1594802	But I didn't know that time I thought that I had like leukemia and emphysema at the same time.
1595322	1597383	No, Dan thought I had emphysema, that was funny.
1597844	1598184	He's like...
1598914	1601075	Who was mistaking emphysema for bronchitis?
1602756	1604517	Isn't emphysema something smokers get?
1604537	1604837	Yeah.
1604877	1606878	And you quit quite some years ago, didn't you?
1606918	1607798	Five and a half years ago.
1607838	1609699	Yeah, so that's weird.
1613140	1625046	Anyway, so all the snot in my nose that's been consistently draining since I had this infection start has been going right into my lungs.
1626506	1628247	And then I've been, of course, coughing it all back up
1629153	1631054	I sound like I'm going to die every moment.
1632454	1640578	And then I got over all the nasty, you know, fevery, shakes, all those symptoms, but I cough myself into headaches now, which sucks.
1641678	1642459	I have a headache right now.
1644700	1650642	So it got bad enough that Tuesday when I was doing laundry, I stopped breathing for like a little bit.
1650682	1651462	I had to go lay down.
1653563	1657265	I took like three puffs off my Ibuterol, laid down,
1658406	1662029	It felt better finishing my laundry, but I called the doctor the next day.
1662570	1664631	So they gave me more asthma medicine that night.
1665632	1671417	And then they said, I get a call the next day that says, either come into the doctor or if we can't schedule you, go to the emergency room.
1672297	1675020	So I was like, okay, oh shit, that's like pretty, pretty bad.
1675580	1676561	So I went to the doctor.
1677461	1679203	Turns out I had sinus infection, drainage.
1682464	1684406	and then they prescribed me more drugs.
1684946	1689930	So now I'm on an antibiotic and I'm on Robitussin with codeine.
1690571	1691251	Robitussin.
1691531	1692052	Robitussin.
1694998	1700161	And I swear at night that, okay, you know me and my insane tolerance for alcohol.
1700241	1702183	Coding will just totally screw my head up.
1702923	1704084	So I take it before bed.
1704604	1708947	And I'm really groggy when I wake up in the morning and dizzy and all kinds of fun stuff.
1708987	1710308	So I'm on all kinds of drugs now.
1711288	1714710	And on top of that, my voice sounds really crappy at work in a call center.
1715451	1718712	So, I'm hoping that I get over this crap before I go to Alabama.
1719713	1722374	Um, to, that's next Tuesday.
1723455	1725156	I'm going to be on a plane next Tuesday.
1726817	1730979	Anyway, so that's also why I sound really crappy.
1732160	1735442	And I'm about to, you know, spew up one of my lungs on your carpet.
1736742	1737823	So you can put it on the webcam.
1743266	1744627	Alright, well, feel better soon.
1744887	1752572	I mean, that kind of sucks that you have to go back to work tomorrow and talk, but on the bright side, maybe, you know, it'll build something up, the talking.
1752612	1753593	I don't know how that works.
1754833	1758616	You have no idea how gross it is.
1760564	1768070	I can kind of imagine, because I know that, you know, as somebody in my position, I have to talk a lot of times all day long, too, when I'm teaching.
1768110	1769671	I talk loud, too, because I'm teaching.
1770231	1782100	And usually, if I go for a while, like if we're in between classes and I'm not talking a lot loud, and it takes me a little while those first couple days when I get back into class, where I have to kind of build up my voice again, so...
1789853	1791874	I'm talking about actually coughing up everything.
1791934	1792574	It's really gross.
1794915	1799316	Luckily, I haven't had to go through being sick and trying to do all that yet, but who knows?
1799396	1799916	Maybe someday.
1801857	1803337	Okay, so let's move on.
1804317	1805138	Let's talk to Bradley.
1806718	1808019	Bradley, how was your day and how was your week?
1808659	1809859	And I think I'm sitting on the cord.
1809879	1811720	Sorry, we'll give you a little more room there.
1812780	1813180	My bad.
1815081	1815821	Tear each cord.
1817372	1819554	That's as long as you're going to get to go.
1819574	1820194	Oh, I have the long one.
1822255	1822796	There we go.
1823556	1824917	Now it's all untangled.
1825537	1827739	Well, this week not too much happened.
1828359	1830881	Sat around most of the day doing not much.
1831321	1837885	Well, actually I shipped out like 20 or so packages to various places in the U.S.
1838045	1839526	and six other countries.
1842950	1857834	On Tuesday, I finally went by Fireside Lanes, which is like a mile from where I live, so I went and checked out their DDR Extreme, and it's in pretty good shape, so I played two games then, and then went back on Thursday and played six.
1859975	1864116	And now my foot hurts from all that stomping.
1866637	1867317	Let's see, what else?
1869495	1879462	and yesterday I fixed up my 2DX controller a bit so I can actually play some 2DX for the first time at home for the first time in like two months.
1879702	1882404	God, I haven't played 2DX at home in a long time.
1882825	1891771	I'm really hoping that, well, I mean maybe we'll talk about it later, but I'm just hoping that there is in fact a new consumer style coming out and yes, I know they got all the signatures and da-da-da-da-da.
1892311	1892992	We'll address it later.
1893032	1896174	I just really hope it happens and they don't try to dick us somehow.
1898596	1898796	Yeah.
1900225	1901325	It better not suck, too.
1901665	1904486	Considering we've had to wait like a year and a half at least, if not two years.
1904506	1908627	Probably not have to wait two years for this new 2DX, basically, from the time we got the last one.
1908967	1913828	If it sucks, Konami can, like, just go to hell.
1914028	1914328	I don't know.
1915268	1915748	It better be good.
1915768	1917709	It better have like 300 songs on it.
1919709	1919949	Sorry.
1920649	1921209	Well, man.
1922830	1926310	And then... Let's see, what else?
1926710	1929531	If anything happened... Uh...
1932970	1934411	Not really much else happened.
1935292	1939635	Played more 2DX today and passed a few new things.
1940256	1944419	That was like played a few courses and passed a few new ones.
1945600	1947501	That's about everything that happened this week.
1951584	1952845	Alright, on to someone else.
1957769	1958530	Loki, how was your day?
1958550	1959010	How was your week?
1960129	1962990	Um, didn't do anything today except for work on my cabinet a little bit.
1963590	1965391	And it's coming along quite well.
1965431	1967371	I'm on my last sheet of stuff to cut out.
1969132	1973033	And the only thing that's holding me back is the damn battery power in the jigsaw.
1973793	1975673	I mean, otherwise I would have been done today.
1976154	1981915	But, yeah, once it's all cut out, which will be this week, I will start putting it together.
1983176	1987877	And then comes the wonderful job of finding out where we're going to put it.
1990403	1990664	Yeah.
1990984	1991484	No, anyways.
1992425	1994427	Earlier this week... I said we just get rid of the couch.
1995928	2004896	Well, I mean, what I was thinking is that we move that small chair somewhere, put the couch against the window, put the cabinet where her chair is.
2006118	2007058	Because, obviously, the...
2009830	2010251	You okay?
2010271	2011492	Okay.
2011933	2015878	Obviously the camera would be on top of the cabinet sitting somewhere.
2016399	2019944	And then, I don't know, figure out where to put the other chairs.
2020865	2022147	Maybe burn that or something.
2022167	2023729	I don't know, figure it out.
2023849	2024289	I don't know.
2025110	2036456	But, uh, then today, before the show, as you might have seen on the webcam if you're watching, I was calibrating the TV to look nicer, which I don't really notice anything, but whatever.
2036997	2041319	Actually, I noticed that the chat room's more readable than usual, except when people use colors.
2044701	2045141	But, um...
2046909	2060045	Anyways, so we were watching that and said, do not go beyond your abilities or something and showed someone like trying to pry off something on a circuit board and getting electrocuted and then the house started getting electrocuted and then it burst into flames.
2060746	2064310	That was great because the house caught on fire and we had laughed.
2065491	2068333	And then, um... What else?
2069054	2069574	Oh, not much.
2069674	2071956	I ordered the rest of my parts for my cabinet.
2072316	2075938	I ordered my buttons for popping music, so those are coming.
2076479	2078480	Along with my bezel for the monitor.
2078600	2081522	You know, a little black thing that goes around it so it doesn't look like a TV.
2081562	2083183	It looks more like an actual monitor.
2083844	2087746	And then, um... Yeah, it should be coming together pretty fast.
2088487	2091269	So... That's about it.
2092149	2092350	Yeah.
2093430	2093891	Not too much.
2094551	2094871	All right.
2095711	2097912	Oh, and saw Scary Movie 3 this weekend.
2098212	2098852	That was funny.
2098892	2100873	I heard it shattered like a gazillion records.
2100933	2101473	How was it?
2101933	2103114	It was pretty good.
2103254	2110656	It was just, you know, like you hear the names like Airplane and Naked Gun, and your expectations are high on what the movie's supposed to be.
2111116	2112037	And it was good.
2112137	2112957	It was really funny.
2112977	2115318	I was like the first movie that I've seen in a long time.
2115358	2117499	It actually made me laugh out loud in the movie theater.
2119398	2123219	But, you know, a lot of the jokes were ruined from the previews.
2124160	2127921	See, that's why I didn't want to watch those clips, because I knew it would ruin the movie.
2128201	2129381	Well, no, no, no, not those.
2129501	2130582	I'm talking about like the previews.
2130862	2133343	Like one of the funniest ones, like the Michael Jackson thing, you know.
2133623	2134163	Oh, I see.
2134403	2135103	Like stuff like that.
2135143	2136064	But it was good.
2136244	2136504	It was good.
2136684	2136924	All right.
2137404	2137744	Sounds good.
2138684	2140565	So that's it.
2140625	2141485	Nothing else to say about your week?
2141505	2141545	No.
2142126	2142406	All right.
2144266	2144926	My week and my day.
2145047	2147728	I had a pretty boring week, nothing too exciting.
2148108	2156751	I think I've kind of gotten sick of going to Golf Land to play F-Zero and all that, because, I don't know, F-Zero, now that I've unlocked pretty much everything, it's kind of like lost its flair a little bit.
2157091	2163193	I mean, it's still a fun game, and it's way better than Initial D, but I'm just kind of bored with it now.
2164554	2170416	Plus, what's weird about Golf Land, the local arcade that a lot of us play at, is that they now have...
2171343	2177002	Two Initial D machines for a total of four cars to play Initial D with.
2179141	2179521	DarkSakura.com
2201981	2205445	Um, and then DDR Extreme's still cool, I guess.
2205485	2207167	I'm still trying to AAA stuff.
2207267	2210771	I don't think I got anything new this week, but, you know, I'm working on my heavy AAAs.
2211512	2214695	Getting a lot of single-digit grades, but no heavy AAAs, but I'm working there.
2214795	2215296	I'm working on it.
2216357	2218279	For some reason, I want my PA to get better.
2218299	2221262	Not that I'm ever going to be that great, but, you know, I can try.
2221282	2221322	Um...
2225149	2230254	And then pretty much I've been working on my game of Final Fantasy X. I won't spoil where I'm at.
2230814	2231675	I won't give a spoiler.
2231695	2234838	I'll just say I'm at Mount... What the hell is it called?
2234858	2236139	Mount Gagazil, I think it's called.
2236679	2238661	That's where I'm at right now, so for those of you who play the game.
2240663	2246067	So I think by my estimations I'm probably about a halfway, somewhere between halfway and two-thirds through it.
2247208	2259175	So, still got a ways to go, and I'm trying to burn through it before Final Fantasy XI comes out on Wednesday, except I don't see that really happening, because I've got Vanilla Sky tomorrow night, and then Final Fantasy XI comes out Wednesday.
2259215	2262877	Now, the interesting thing is, I work a short week next week.
2262897	2265359	I'm only working Monday and Tuesday, because I have three days off.
2265379	2270301	I'm supposed to go to Hollywood for Halloween, but I foresee that the trip might be canceled.
2270321	2271462	I'm going to find out for sure tonight.
2271482	2272823	So, if the trip ends up getting canceled...
2273223	2273684	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2289398	2291820	I've kind of been staying away from information on the game.
2291860	2293000	I've looked at the benchmark.
2293020	2293821	I've looked at the demo.
2294761	2296762	I watched Brad Lanky's style.
2296923	2299504	If you listen to Vanilla Sky, he's on there a lot.
2301005	2304047	He was a beta tester for Final Fantasy XI, so I saw it a little bit over there.
2304107	2309970	But other than that, I've really been kind of just keeping it a surprise what all is going to wait for me in Final Fantasy XI.
2310010	2311951	I haven't read up on the classes or anything, so...
2313232	2314013	It should be exciting.
2314093	2317518	But the thing is, is that come Wednesday, I want to make sure I get the game.
2317558	2319060	Like, I want to be one of the first people with the game.
2319260	2321663	Because I want to make sure the name I want doesn't fucking get taken.
2321683	2323565	Because I hate that shit when people steal my name.
2324446	2325047	It's my name.
2325107	2325568	Back off!
2327590	2328712	I have a radio show and you don't.
2328732	2329933	Therefore, I'm entitled to the name.
2333621	2334462	And that's pretty much it.
2335002	2337404	So it's kind of just anticipating my vacation next week.
2337444	2337725	Yay!
2338145	2339987	And then not a whole lot too exciting this week.
2340067	2342008	I haven't been to play 2DX in like six weeks.
2342028	2343089	I haven't been to Scandia in a while.
2343710	2346292	Just Golfland and playing stuff here.
2346352	2347253	Playing Castlevania.
2347553	2348915	Loki bought the new Castlevania game.
2350256	2351557	And I'll talk more about that tomorrow night.
2352277	2352718	I'm an else guy.
2354369	2356309	Okay, I think we're going to go to a break.
2357150	2362211	And when we come back, we'll talk about some more news and some things going on in the Milani world.
2362251	2364451	I think maybe we'll do the news story next.
2364911	2369232	We had a news story that aired locally here in Sacramento, California, where we all live.
2369832	2370892	And it's comedy.
2371292	2377614	So you guys definitely want to stay tuned and listen for this because we're going to play it for you guys and make fun of it because that's what we do.
2378574	2382875	We'll be back after a set of some five-key Beatmania songs.
2382915	2383375	This should be fun.
2384202	2385050	We will be right back.
2562366	2568795	I'm out to play, gonna have me some fun In a world that is totally mine
2614088	2615829	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
2615989	2624555	And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
2641212	2647180	Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
2647500	2649383	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
2649964	2654369	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
2655150	2657934	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 66.
2659210	2660972	UPN United Paramount Network
2675190	2693520	United Postal Board United Crappy Television Network United Wrestling Network That's the only thing they're famous for I like Smackdown That's the only show they've got, basically That and Enterprise And Black Television And yes, the leader in Black Television So anyway, UPN did this story about
2693960	2720273	Dance Dance Revolution and this aired on our local affiliate Channel 31 here in Sacramento and we wanted to play the story for you so you can see what the real people out there have to say about DDR so we're going to fire up the clip here and we will be of course stopping it and interjecting our own snide comments occasionally so here we go we're just waiting for it to load are you going to put it on TV so Jamie can see too?
2722614	2723595	you don't think it will work over there?
2724056	2726292	Jamie, you're going to have to come here if you want to see it, otherwise you have to just listen.
2728772	2730672	When you think of video games, what comes to mind?
2731072	2733593	The joystick, the chair, the set of steady eyes.
2733973	2734453	It's not very loud.
2734473	2734933	Can you turn it up?
2734993	2739634	This is the home version on PlayStation right now of DDR, which we talked about at the top of the show.
2739674	2743535	Because gone are the days of Pac-Man fever, the Donkey Kong craze.
2743875	2746395	This is an interactive video that swept the nation.
2746495	2748515	It's definitely not for couch potatoes.
2748895	2753776	And GES's Tara Moriarty is shaking her groove saying it's John's Incredible Pizza in Stockton.
2753836	2755176	They're playing.
2755457	2756977	It's like two split screens.
2756997	2757357	They've got...
2759958	2764962	They basically have Konomics playing in the background on a widescreen TV in the studio.
2765242	2770727	Then they got some dumb bitch on the spot in, what was it, John's Famous Pizza?
2771667	2774970	John's Incredible Pizza, which is pretty much like Chuck E. Cheese.
2774990	2776551	It's got tons of rides and stuff.
2777032	2779534	They actually have carnival rides in there, which is pretty sweet.
2781395	2786299	So they're playing DDR Max 2 with all the employees who aren't working.
2792861	2800267	Justin Timberlake They're having a dance-off There's two employees on the machine playing something on basic He's been doing the machine
2819222	2821465	and you're really good.
2822025	2822546	Yes, I am.
2823427	2824748	Pause it, pause it, pause it.
2825369	2826811	What a conceited little bastard.
2827912	2829073	So I hear you're good at DDR.
2829233	2830575	Well, yes, I am actually.
2832117	2834840	God, I would have loved to have been there to kick his ass.
2836434	2838735	Everybody else I know, they're not talking to the person on the machine.
2838755	2839815	They're talking to some guy off the machine.
2839835	2841076	We're going to see him play at the end of the story.
2841096	2842816	But everybody else I know that plays DDR.
2843256	2845977	Anybody that's good in tournaments and stuff like that, it's like this thing.
2846217	2847778	And don't get me wrong, this thing bugs me too.
2847858	2850059	But, you know, you ask somebody if they're good at DDR.
2850099	2854800	You could be talking to somebody who comes in like top three in tournaments and they'll go, yeah, I'm okay.
2855160	2855640	Yeah, I'm okay.
2855881	2856721	Yeah, I play it sometimes.
2857241	2862323	You know, it's like sometimes DDR community is just like over-humblefied.
2862343	2862903	You know what I mean?
2864438	2869939	If somebody asks me how good I am at DDR, I'm going to say, well, let me just put it this way, I kind of used to play it a lot.
2871700	2873300	Yeah, that's more my response.
2873340	2875341	I just say, I haven't played for a few years.
2875881	2876861	I've practiced a lot.
2878022	2878582	All right, move on.
2881362	2882283	I think you have to hit play.
2882303	2882983	Yeah, I have to hit play.
2885206	2886949	And so, who does this?
2887189	2889172	I mean, old people, young people?
2889212	2890194	Everybody now and then.
2890214	2892958	They come, they try, and they really have fun on this game.
2893038	2895361	Even if they're not good, they can really dance.
2895942	2896463	What's the key?
2896663	2898386	Because I think it's really difficult.
2899486	2905151	Actually, the key is to listen to the beat and just watch the arrows go from bottom to top and hit the corresponding step.
2905872	2907594	Okay, and so what are these two doing right now?
2907654	2909055	They're doing like the light version.
2909075	2911437	You can do heavy, moderate, or light.
2911477	2914020	There's three difficulty settings.
2914040	2916322	There's light, standard, and heavy.
2916923	2922488	Okay, we're going to cut over to Lloyd and Beth so we can see how they are stacking up against this competition here.
2922948	2923529	Let's take a look.
2924378	2925058	Are you guys ready?
2925439	2927420	Oh, yeah, Tara, we're picking our song.
2927480	2927940	Pause it.
2928440	2936304	So, okay, so they're having this dance-off, quote-unquote, between the people playing in the arcade and then the two hosts in the studio.
2937313	2944518	I don't know how the fuck that works, but they're having a dance-off, which means we're going to make asses of ourselves all at the same time on this game.
2944558	2946579	He looks completely unenthusiastic.
2946599	2951843	Okay, these people have no, they don't need to be touching this software at all.
2952043	2958647	I mean, this is why old people, I'm sure these guys aren't touching the software, that's what interns are for.
2958767	2962830	You know, I used to be an intern at a television station, trust me, that's what the interns are there for.
2962870	2964271	These guys don't have to know shit about the game.
2966389	2967210	They're fucking stupid.
2967230	2971354	But anyways, let's watch and laugh at them as they make an ass of themselves.
2971794	2974497	And in response, yeah, they were playing the whistle song at the beginning.
2974517	2976259	I'm not going to pick the maniac level.
2976679	2977580	No, no, no.
2977620	2979321	Basic.
2979382	2980422	Use your arms with me.
2980442	2981644	Come on, you're a big boy.
2981784	2982264	Just bounce.
2982484	2982905	Just bounce.
2982965	2983545	Okay, ready?
2984086	2984406	Left.
2984847	2985007	Left.
2986788	2990270	The guy is not even looking at the screen and they're playing dive.
2990330	2991730	Pause it, pause it.
3005191	3005671	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
3035571	3037473	Turned around and bitch-slapped her and said, Stop it!
3037513	3040056	I'm making a big ass out of myself on television as it is.
3040116	3040736	Leave me alone.
3042238	3044139	And... Move on.
3044179	3045300	We'll give you the link to the video at the end.
3045320	3046942	Oh, and look, they failed.
3048823	3049223	Pause.
3049323	3049724	Pause.
3050324	3052725	It took them a whopping 15 seconds to fail dive.
3052765	3059628	Whoever decided to pick a four-foot song for these two incompetent hosts to play on the start, that was a bad mistake.
3059648	3060989	That intern is so fired.
3061249	3062950	That intern is so genius.
3063270	3064991	He's like, I fucking hate those bastards.
3065011	3066512	They make me do all their fucking workflow.
3066712	3068392	I'll make them look like fools on TV.
3070054	3074179	And now the male host is so shocked that he failed, he has Sylvester Stallone face.
3074219	3077362	He's got like, oh, Adrian, I fucked up.
3077502	3080786	Meanwhile, the employees are still going at it.
3080846	3084490	Meanwhile, the employees are still going at it on the whistle song and not working.
3086833	3087073	Uh-oh.
3088675	3098579	So now the female host is asserting her authority and just yanking the other two employees off the machine and letting the third employee, who happens to be a DDR maniac here, put in his coin.
3117651	3119211	And then you get to pick your own song.
3119331	3121412	Pick your own song, pick your own difficulty level.
3121632	3122832	Look, words in Japanese.
3123292	3125693	This game will give you the seizure.
3125733	3127273	It's Max 2, by the way.
3127853	3129253	You have about 20 seconds.
3129954	3130114	Okay.
3130134	3132474	He's going to do the heaviest difficulty possible.
3132574	3134555	And this guy, I mean, this is like a workout.
3134615	3141936	I mean, if you don't want to go to aerobic class or... So you go straight for Healing Vision Angelic Mix, because he's going to show how big his dick is right here on TV.
3141956	3142976	We'll just fade out here, Beth.
3142996	3143676	Just catch this guy.
3147612	3152835	And he also picked the song where the woman's gonna have to stretch for like 20 seconds to fill this blank spot.
3152915	3153536	I'm so fucking amazed.
3166084	3167085	I can see my reflection.
3167105	3167325	Pause it!
3167345	3167645	Pause it!
3167665	3170007	God, she did not go dance, dance, dance.
3170067	3178652	Yes, she just said dance, dance, dance, revolution.
3178912	3182294	It's like either she read the teleprompter wrong or something happened.
3182935	3185176	You're playing dance, dance, dance, revolution.
3185616	3191520	The sequel to dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, revolution, revolution.
3195888	3196548	Let the bitch finish.
3199849	3206571	Xbox is going to come out with a version that's DDR Ultra Mix, and the one we have in our studio is thanks to Jim and Suzanne Eckes.
3206952	3208912	Okay, and then that's it.
3209012	3209552	It just cuts off.
3210053	3211913	Notice I say nothing about Konomics in there.
3212173	3215874	They say nothing about, oh, Max 2 is out now and you can buy it.
3216074	3220616	This is further proof that Microsoft is trying to buy out the world with this stupid Xbox thing.
3221696	3227863	Because there's another place, and we'll talk about this later in the show, where they have a huge advertisement for DDR on the Xbox.
3228184	3231187	They say nothing about, oh, Max 2, available now.
3231267	3234211	It's all about, no, the Xbox version's coming out.
3234251	3234431	What?
3234731	3237755	When she said right at the beginning of the thing that she said for PlayStation 4.
3238641	3239962	But she was playing Kanonix.
3240262	3242123	She wasn't even playing what's available right now.
3242663	3250867	And thanks to these two people who are probably interns or something that brought it in, I would have been like, oh, fuck this Yoshi bitch, man.
3250907	3253149	I want to fucking do doubles and kick his ass.
3253389	3257551	I'd be like, oh, man, that makes me so wet and hot because he's so sexy.
3257751	3259192	He's better than that Asian man.
3259732	3261433	Oh, man, I want a piece of that.
3262245	3265369	and then it would have all been like, oh my god, he is so cool.
3265409	3266109	You know what, Rob?
3266129	3266209	What?
3266750	3272016	I think we need to write them and say, hi, we host a radio station about the money and we think you're stupid.
3274098	3275580	Love, Orange Elves Radio.
3275740	3277762	I will write that letter if you want me to.
3277942	3282227	I will write that letter telling them, you know, that their article was... They should interview us.
3282307	3282948	You know what, though?
3284747	3286567	I don't think we need to waste our time with it.
3286587	3287688	I'm going to be honest with you.
3287748	3290029	I just, you know, let it be whatever.
3290169	3294031	We've got bigger fish to fry than trying to get our faces on UPN Network.
3297535	3297835	All right.
3298176	3306001	If you want to watch that story and laugh at it yourself, the link is www.upn31.com.
3306082	3308063	And Telemore's Lounge Radio sent you.
3308103	3311666	The link there, by the way, is on the bottom right of the page.
3312126	3316489	It says, Beth and Lloyd cut a rug in a video game dance-off.
3316810	3319191	Who fucking says cut a rug anymore?
3319812	3322874	I just ate Taco Bell and I've got to cut a rug right now.
3322934	3324475	Hello and welcome to the fifth piece.
3329179	3330599	Oh man, I gotta cut a rug.
3331080	3332320	Rob, that's cut the cheese.
3333980	3338201	Whenever I hear cut a rug, it makes me think of farting, or queefing, probably.
3339482	3339622	Ew.
3340962	3342602	I gotta vibrate the rug a little bit.
3343383	3345863	Cutting a rug, isn't that like what porn stars do?
3345923	3350724	You know, they get prepared for their videos, you know, they cut their rug and make sure the carpet's all trimmed.
3350745	3352505	That's called shaving their private area.
3354409	3356530	Well, cutting a rug doesn't make me think of dancing.
3356850	3359691	I mean, dancing and cutting a rug are, like, completely different.
3360051	3370734	You know, to cut a rug you have to be bent over and, like, actually, you know, cutting the rug with, like, a knife or something, whereas, you know, dancing you're gyrating about to music, so I don't get it.
3371915	3372515	Stupid hippies.
3375874	3384338	All right, we're going to take a break, and when we come back, we're going to talk a little bit about an interesting... We'll come back and take scissors to your carpet here.
3384378	3387079	Yeah, and we're going to cut the rug here in the studio when we get back.
3387659	3394001	And when we're done cutting the rug, we'll get into the Orange Lounge Cage Match, so make sure you're in the chat room so you can vote in tonight's Cage Match.
3394322	3402765	And we're going to talk about a really interesting location, probably, dare I say it, the most interesting place I've ever seen a DDR machine.
3403125	3404726	And I don't think I've seen a unique...
3406247	3410653	We'll talk about that when we come back.
3411955	3416643	This break, I think we're going to do some DDR Euro stuff.
3416903	3419948	Let's do some music from... Let's just have some Eurobeat.
3420028	3420409	Why not?
3420871	3421592	You want Eurobeat?
3421612	3422692	You want Parapara music?
3422713	3424034	Let's go for some Parapara.
3424294	3425214	All right, we'll do that.
3425295	3427156	We'll do God.
3427797	3429038	People are going to hate us for this one.
3429258	3431479	Yeah, but no stylist is going to piss his pants.
3431760	3433461	It'll be short and painless, you guys.
3434322	3437644	Okay, we'll be back after some quick block of music from Parapara.
3437865	3438325	We'll be back.
3438405	3439065	Orange Launch Radio.
3440607	3441367	Parapara.
3464152	3465074	Thank you for watching!
3492888	3494093	Thank you for watching!
3673099	3674313	Don't wait for me
3805296	3814804	Orange Lounge Radio Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
3814924	3818748	You know, and I believe we've been doing this show, what, 66 weeks now?
3819585	3824428	I think that is probably only the second time I can ever remember us doing a para-para music break.
3824889	3825529	You know what?
3825869	3826030	What?
3826050	3827651	I couldn't help it when Eurobeat was on.
3827711	3829952	I found myself starting to do part of that one.
3830713	3832634	That was my first para-para.
3833014	3836577	Those songs, by the way, for you guys tuning in that maybe don't know much about the game.
3836597	3837838	Boom Boom Fire was the first one.
3837858	3841040	That was probably, I think for most of us, the first para we learned.
3841060	3841280	Oh.
3841460	3842281	Thank you for watching!
3860172	3861974	Abra, Abra, Cadabra
3875279	3876679	Parapara songs are really cool.
3876699	3877800	They're like some of the better ones.
3877820	3879560	And there needs to be more of them in 2DX.
3879600	3882461	Like if 2DX just needs more songs, just take some from Parapara.
3882501	3884982	One of my early six stars was a Parapara song.
3885482	3890423	And my first seven star was a Eurobeat.
3891023	3895064	Also, I believe it was... My first two sevens.
3895184	3895845	No, I take that back.
3896045	3902626	My second three... Out of the first three that I passed, the second and third ones were Eurobeat.
3902646	3902847	Sorry.
3903627	3904487	My first one was Please Don't Go.
3905596	3907137	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3924842	3927983	Yeah, I'll vouch for that.
3928003	3930103	You've been in the car with me with my Eurobeat.
3930223	3935504	I'm a very safe, over-safe driver, and when I put that CD in, I go like 90 miles an hour.
3936364	3939105	You've been in the car with me with my Eurobeat.
3940745	3941765	I don't remember who I was with.
3941885	3943626	It was Ryan.
3944466	3948466	Somebody said that I get all cool when I drive with Eurobeat.
3948486	3950247	I was like, what do you mean by cool?
3950267	3951347	He was like, aggressive.
3952239	3954060	What do you think happened with Parapara?
3954080	3956621	I want to kind of ask this question to anybody who wants to answer it.
3956701	3957701	What happened with Parapara?
3958001	3958742	It came out.
3959302	3961223	It was the coolest fucking thing on the block.
3961783	3967345	Everybody wanted to go to Milpitas Golf Line to play Parapara because it was like, oh, it's like DDR, but it's your hands, okay?
3967990	3968631	www.DarkSakura.com
3989537	3990378	Thanks for watching!
4005171	4006672	This all fucking sounds the same.
4006812	4007333	And that was it.
4007553	4008514	I was done with Parapara.
4008794	4011216	And I think it was about the time it was released for the home version.
4011276	4016621	Like, I taught myself, like, four Paraparas so I could, like, go to the arcade and blend in with a cool crowd.
4017001	4019003	And then I just didn't give a shit anymore.
4019203	4021364	And I didn't really care about anything, Parapara.
4021384	4023046	I remember when RPGL got the Patapata machine.
4023586	4024227	I remember that, too.
4024367	4029371	And there were people who were staring at that scratch in their butts going, Ugh, what do we do?
4029992	4030372	And then...
4031337	4035680	We got up there and Rick ate the paper that says do not shadow.
4035941	4041585	Oh yeah, it was great because at Sunnyvale Golf Land, their machine used to have a big sign on it saying do not shadow.
4041885	4046509	Because if you've been to Sunnyvale Golf Land, you can't fucking walk down the aisle if there's anybody standing in it, right?
4047009	4048751	So you don't want to have people standing there shadowing.
4048771	4053114	And it was like this big thing too because Sunnyvale Golf Land is kind of where the backlash sort of began, I think.
4053634	4057537	A lot of those people who think they're cooler than everybody else kind of started that whole thing.
4058098	4058398	And then...
4059899	4061780	They had the big sign on there that said, Don't Shadow.
4061800	4064802	Well, what ended up happening, that machine got moved from Sunnyvale to Roseville, Goughland.
4064822	4070124	The first day it came in, one of our regulars over there took the paper off the machine and ate it.
4070224	4071145	It was hilarious.
4071185	4072825	And we have a picture of it hanging out of his mouth.
4073266	4078208	Kind of a symbolic thing, like, kind of, screw you, we're going to do what we want.
4078748	4085732	And I remember, it would usually be, I'd play, you'd shadow, and someone else would shadow, too.
4087132	4088133	One of the person would shadow.
4089972	4090753	Who else was it?
4091073	4091673	Was it Anita?
4092334	4095416	No, this was when we first knew Anita.
4095476	4096057	I don't remember.
4096277	4098239	So there was a couple people.
4099019	4100420	Just the parents were funny.
4101161	4101481	Oh, yeah.
4101501	4105504	They'd be like, uh, we're stupid.
4105584	4106325	Whatcha do?
4108657	4112598	Some different theories from the chat room as to what happened to Parapara and why it's not cool anymore.
4113278	4116019	SnubDisanoid says, I think people saw themselves playing.
4116519	4117339	That's what it ended.
4117600	4122001	When somebody just saw themselves playing and went, God, I look like an ass.
4123041	4127362	StablerX says, looks just like another passing Japanese trend.
4128160	4130883	I think for me is I stopped going to RVGL.
4131644	4133206	That's a big part of it too.
4133667	4134948	I played when we go to Miggle.
4135189	4135689	You know what?
4135729	4137752	People look stupid when they play DDR too.
4137872	4144500	So I don't know if people seeing themselves playing is necessarily a turn off because you look just as stupid playing DDR.
4144960	4147443	And in fact, like Dance Maniacs, that's the worst.
4149322	4152245	Okay, I love Dance Maniacs, and you know what?
4152305	4154666	I'm fucking building a Dance Maniacs machine.
4155047	4158810	Well, my machine covers everything, but Dance Maniacs is part of it, so there.
4159510	4160891	I'm just saying, that's cool.
4160971	4164294	I love Dance Maniacs too, but you look like a total boob playing it.
4164374	4165735	I mean, that's the thing.
4165875	4166395	Hey, Rob.
4166516	4167436	Yeah, but it's fun.
4167516	4168177	It doesn't matter.
4168197	4168737	Rob.
4169358	4169618	What?
4169898	4170899	You said boob.
4171780	4172600	I did say boob.
4172620	4174382	Okay.
4175663	4175943	Okay.
4177557	4182300	SCDriftKing says, my DWI is equal to forearm exercise.
4183521	4185302	You don't want to know what my forearm exercise is.
4186863	4191446	Actually, I want to address DDRcolic's idea about what happened.
4191746	4196328	She says, I think what happened is all the haters started being haters and ruined it for everyone.
4197229	4202052	Well, you know what I say, if haters are bothering you, you need to fight hate with hate.
4203300	4204643	Don't stand for that shit.
4205063	4207287	Outnumber them and make fun of them.
4207588	4209291	That is how you're going to stop the haters.
4209531	4211114	You fight hate with hate.
4212457	4214180	We used to fight them with making fun of them.
4215074	4215514	I remember.
4215534	4216035	And it worked.
4216155	4221697	The people that make fun of DDR, we would totally, we would just like, we'd gang up on them, like some kind of geek gang.
4221978	4228101	We'd like all surround, remember the guy that made fun of me one night playing DDR, and then like ten of us, we all just kind of like jumped him, like sort of thing.
4228121	4230362	We were like, hey, you want to get up there and fight him, you know, play against him?
4230382	4231442	And he cried.
4231682	4233103	He ran to the bathroom and cried.
4233623	4234764	And you offered to pay for his game.
4235765	4238206	And then there's all those other people who I would just have thrown out.
4239346	4240507	Haha, guess what?
4240667	4242568	If you're going to make fun of us, then you don't get to play anything.
4245410	4245730	All right.
4249031	4259074	I think it was because, you know, submitting, you know, kind of playing para para is kind of like almost just like converting over to being metrosexual.
4259674	4267997	So, you know, that's why people weren't playing it because they're like, you know, afraid of the bright, shiny side, if you would like to call it that.
4268377	4272578	What do you think would happen if you were to show that to the folks from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy?
4274292	4275153	I've never watched that show.
4275193	4276233	Crab people!
4276353	4280096	I think even the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy people would go, okay, that is too gay.
4280496	4281357	Get that out of your house.
4281377	4282017	That's too gay.
4282518	4282878	Too gay.
4283658	4286200	Well, you want to know what, though, before... It's going to be in this house.
4286520	4287761	Before there was a pata pata.
4288402	4292524	Though, I don't know if you remember, but there's videos that I found way back when.
4292845	4293665	Yeah, the par videos.
4294085	4302331	No, the ones where they were demoing the game in Japan with the little girls with their flowery shirts doing the pata pata on the machine.
4302887	4307409	It's because the little Japanese girls are fucking hot and they're like, I'll do whatever you want.
4307769	4312850	And then also, you know, the guy, get that guy Bucky to fucking come over here and just like beat ass.
4312930	4317852	I mean, if he was like the main like star of the game, people would be just falling over that game.
4319012	4324534	Jumping backwards a little bit, about three people in the chat room because of the buffer are asking, what is metrosexual?
4324554	4332337	Apparently you haven't watched South Park, but anyways, metrosexual is where you act gay, but you're not gay.
4333052	4336574	It's kind of like being high in fashion stuff and that type of thing.
4337534	4340996	Metrosexual is being gay to get chicks.
4341036	4346338	It's like the thing where five years ago, make fun of gays, can them, all this stuff.
4346358	4350380	Trust me, I was afraid to come out for a long time because I didn't want to face this backlash.
4350480	4353762	Now, five years later, if you're gay, you're cool.
4355114	4368723	It's like, you know, being metrosexual is being one of those guys that's kind of up there going, you know, on a date with some woman at a candlelight dinner, you know, yeah, you know, I blew a guy once, you know, just experimenting type thing, and that's supposed to, like, make him more attractive.
4369844	4372646	You know... I don't think it's that at all.
4372706	4376068	I think it's better to be that than manual sexual.
4377669	4379070	It's just what that means.
4380691	4383673	Yeah, anyways, it's like, you know, I think it's just like, you know...
4384747	4385707	Okay, define it.
4385767	4387628	Manual has to do with using your hands.
4389689	4394971	Okay, anyways, um, it's like, it's like, you know how smoking was cool back in the 90s and stuff?
4395011	4398713	It's like being gay is cool now in like the year 2000 and so on.
4399333	4402174	You know, next year it'll be like bestiality or something.
4402194	4403515	It's just, it's fads.
4404535	4406356	Hey kids, be cool, fuck a sheep.
4407516	4408477	They're at sexual.
4410558	4411558	Alright, um.
4413012	4413473	DarkSakura.com
4429884	4431627	Okay, and now I'm being corrected on this too.
4431687	4435652	If it's metrosexual or metarosexual, it's either or.
4435672	4436593	They mean the same thing.
4436653	4439157	People say it either way because metro, hetero, get it?
4439357	4440439	Metro is like city.
4440639	4440999	Well, right.
4441039	4444264	A metro is kind of what it's supposed to be, but people say metro.
4444324	4446367	It kind of formed into that.
4449156	4453459	They're saying in the chat room Ben Affleck is a perfect definition of a metrosexual.
4453879	4458423	I would say more like Justin Timberlake is a perfect example of someone who's metrosexual.
4458683	4463026	He does all these really fucking gay things like being an NSYNC, right?
4466280	4469721	I was so good she could never have another man after me.
4469741	4471681	That's why she's gone lesbian, and that's even harder.
4493709	4498533	Anyway, so the moral of the story is, leave being gay to the gay people.
4500195	4503218	You know, be accepting, but be straight, okay?
4503258	4504078	That's all we ask.
4504599	4510224	You know, going back to my live journal post about National Whatever Days, you know what?
4510244	4512106	They need to have National Blowjob Day.
4512126	4512206	Okay.
4514412	4519675	They do have all these like sex appreciation day, masturbation day.
4520355	4522796	I'm sure they have a blowjob day somewhere on the calendar, Jamie.
4522816	4524197	You just don't have it penciled in.
4525497	4525957	You know what?
4525977	4527258	That's because they're gross.
4529139	4529419	All right.
4530299	4531100	I will look it up.
4531860	4534161	Loki is going to look up National Blowjob Day for you all.
4534221	4534501	Okay.
4535402	4536582	Let's shift gears a little bit.
4536602	4536742	Okay.
4539292	4542935	I want to ask a question to the chat room, going back to something actually Bomani related.
4543276	4547159	Send this to me over private message, by the way, because I'll read these later.
4547760	4550943	I want to hear from people who aren't in Sacramento, first off.
4550983	4552504	Thank you guys for listening, our local friends.
4552784	4555006	But I want to hear from people outside of Sacramento.
4555026	4561012	I want to hear the strangest place you've ever seen a Bomani machine, whether it be DDR or something like that.
4562156	4565659	I want to hear the strangest place you've ever seen a DDR or some kind of a Monty machine.
4566679	4571563	Because what we found out this week, let's rewind to Monday.
4571863	4572884	Monday, Vanilla Sky.
4573344	4578688	After Vanilla Sky was over, LankyStyle, RicePrincess, and I, we all went to Walmart to do some shopping, or at least I was shopping.
4579068	4580689	I wanted to go buy Cheesy Poofs, basically.
4582690	4586493	So I was going to Walmart to buy some Cheesy Poofs, and hold on.
4588274	4590316	Loki says National Blowjob Day is October 3rd.
4592862	4594984	It's also National Go Commando Day.
4595064	4597746	So National Blowjob Day is October 3rd.
4597806	4601829	So if you missed National Blowjob Day, I want you to celebrate tonight.
4602269	4602630	Okay?
4603891	4605472	So here's your chance to make up for it.
4605492	4606613	Happy belated blowjob day.
4606653	4610176	If you don't have anyone to participate with you, then get some flexibility.
4610636	4610916	All right.
4611597	4611977	There you go.
4612037	4613839	Now can I get back on the topic of strange blowing machines?
4614159	4615320	Okay, so send me a private message.
4615340	4617241	Strangest place you've ever seen a Bomani machine.
4617281	4620624	I'm Sky in the chat room over at www.callybomani.com.
4620644	4621825	Click on orange lines and click on chat.
4623112	4631597	Vanilla Sky, went to get Cheesy Poofs, and usually, whenever I go to Walmart, I can't help but go into the electronics department, because they have cheap electronics.
4631957	4638180	Cheap mouses, cheap CDs, cheap games, cheap everything, because Walmart is the land of everything cheap.
4638360	4638781	Mouses.
4638861	4646945	But for whatever reason, on this Monday, we went to toys and games, we went to stuffed animals and things like that, we did not go into the electronics department.
4647545	4651107	Come to find out Tuesday morning, this comes up on the boards at sacromoney.com.
4651187	4652268	Hey guys, did you hear...
4653647	4655268	Walmart got a DDR machine.
4655888	4657349	And I'm thinking to myself, no they didn't.
4657429	4661991	I was just there at the Walmart in Folsom on Monday and there was no DDR machine to be found.
4662911	4668534	Well, turns out, this DDR machine is smack in the middle of the electronics department at Walmart.
4669834	4673196	Now, most Walmarts I think are all laid out the same.
4673716	4678278	For those listening internationally, Walmart is this huge chain of stores in the U.S.
4678538	4680739	Big, big, big store that sells everything.
4681949	4684009	Most Walmarts, I think, are laid out the same.
4684630	4692791	So, like, when you walk in the electronics department, you have your CDs off to one side, and then off to the other side, in this Walmart, giant DDR solo machine.
4693171	4694172	Just standing right there.
4695132	4699533	Fully operational, takes 50 cents to play three songs, or get three coins, or whatever it is.
4700233	4710355	So, now, I've heard of a Walmart having a DDR machine out in the front arcade, or an arcade on the side, but I have never heard of a machine anywhere in the middle of a fucking store.
4712142	4714784	So, of course, couldn't resist, had to go play it today.
4715525	4720610	Had to go rent some errands anyway at Walmart, so I went to go play the Solo 2000 machine.
4721390	4727536	And again, I want to state, this isn't like the Walmart in Lodi or other places that had it in the front or in a separate arcade.
4727576	4734342	This Solo 2000 machine is right smack in the middle of the electronics department, so as everybody's walking by, people can look at it.
4735157	4736358	The machine is not for sale.
4736398	4737279	They're not trying to sell it.
4737759	4743483	In fact, they even have a sign on the Solo 2000 machine that says, hey, the Xbox music game.
4744524	4745144	They changed it.
4745184	4746005	I guess they updated it.
4746245	4751349	But last week it said, hey, the Xbox music generator is coming out on such and such day.
4751409	4752329	It had nothing to do with DDR.
4752610	4753610	They changed it today.
4753670	4756432	It says Xbox DDR coming out November 18th, right?
4758052	4764462	Again, says nothing about the PlayStation Max 2, says nothing about the already available DDRs out there on PlayStation.
4764502	4766205	It's all about promoting the Xbox.
4766485	4769530	It's almost like Microsoft bought them that machine and put it in the store.
4770551	4770872	I don't know.
4771539	4774422	But now we have this DDR solo machine in the middle of Walmart.
4774603	4778908	It won't be there for long because the parents will see the needles and the barely dressed nurse.
4779088	4780249	That's what I was thinking.
4780349	4782792	Walmart, king of censors.
4783192	4786656	This is the one reason I won't really buy CDs at Walmart.
4786757	4792143	I'll look and see what's new, but I won't buy because I fucking hate that Walmart censors the albums.
4793050	4796532	You go to buy an album at Walmart and you will buy the desensitized version.
4796592	4801794	Look at the fine print, look at the label, and you will see that the CD you're buying at Walmart is the edited version.
4802114	4807417	Meaning they've taken out all the fucks and shits and cop killer statements, right?
4808237	4811039	Even a CD like Madonna's American Life that just came out.
4811059	4815061	The Walmart version in track one, the first song, they took fuck it out.
4815661	4818442	Because, oh heaven forbid, we're going to hurt our children.
4818502	4818862	That is so...
4821109	4823792	That's another case of companies taking responsibility for other people's children
4838326	4839647	Why should Walmart do that?
4839927	4840468	They shouldn't.
4840588	4843169	Why don't they just not sell the CD that says caution?
4843209	4844971	The CD has the word fuck in it.
4845051	4853516	If the parents don't want the children to listen to something with, you know, bad language in it, they need to freaking police what their children are doing themselves.
4853737	4859541	Walmart should not have to institute these kind of policies, but they do because they're run by the religious right.
4859621	4860441	That's a whole other story.
4861862	4862543	That's a whole other story.
4862703	4864304	I prefer calling them the religious wrong.
4865245	4869147	Anyway, that's a discussion for a whole other show.
4869528	4870428	Yes, thank you.
4870508	4872169	Excellent point by Leadfoot in the chat room.
4872650	4875852	Yet they sell rated M games in the gaming section.
4876632	4881215	They'll sell rated M games, but heaven forbid they sell a CD with the word fuck on it.
4881235	4884217	If the video came wrong, how bad could it be?
4885476	4885837	I know.
4886277	4891282	Did you hear about these parents that are suing the makers of Grand Theft Auto because some people got shot or something?
4891302	4891943	No, it's not the parents.
4891983	4897248	It's the relatives of the victims who got shot because some kids went out and imitated Grand Theft Auto.
4897569	4899971	Sue the kids' parents for being idiots.
4900431	4901332	Yeah, seriously.
4901733	4902854	It's not the game's fault.
4902894	4904696	It's the damned impressionable people.
4905316	4908600	You know, they're the social sheep of the world.
4912514	4915954	Anyway, back to DDR before we got off on a little bit of a tangent.
4916395	4917975	Back to DDR in the middle of Walmart.
4918075	4918675	It's quiet.
4918715	4920275	You can't really hear it unless you're on it.
4920636	4923916	The pad is so close to the machine that literally I'm six foot two.
4924477	4927917	This is the first time I've ever played DDR where I have to look down to see the machine.
4928177	4929578	I have to look down to see the screen.
4929638	4930338	It's really weird.
4931676	4934619	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4949358	4952160	I played it like three times this week, all on different occasions.
4952320	4962168	One was getting a pro-action replay so I could cheat in F-Zero GX, and the one that was getting Castlevania, then today was just going there for the hell of it.
4963449	4967352	And all times I played on there, and they'll actually pay me to play because I'm good.
4969074	4973978	Because I'm like, you know, whatever that guy's name... Yoshi.
4974138	4974618	Yoshi.
4974638	4976200	I am like Yoshi.
4977160	4978961	How does that work where they were paying you to play?
4979001	4979502	What did they do?
4980322	4980942	They're all here.
4980962	4981923	We'll give you 50 cents.
4981943	4983944	We're supposed to give you 50 cents so you can play this.
4985545	4987686	It's just because of people that aren't paying attention.
4987946	4990128	There's one nice guy that's been there the last few times.
4990148	4992929	He offered to pay for my games and he did for like one of them.
4992989	4993730	I was like, no, that's cool.
4993770	4994610	I got the other ones, you know.
4995250	4997592	It's just like, I don't want them to just...
4998092	4999113	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5015473	5016754	I think it's kind of cool what they're doing.
5016874	5021538	It's just like, for some reason, Ultramix is getting a lot of press, it seems like, for me.
5021899	5026142	Because, I mean, look, you have the news story, you've got, like, machines in stores.
5026242	5029866	It's like, that's all you're hearing around this goddamn Ultramix.
5031167	5033028	I don't know, it's like they're really pushing this one.
5036441	5042204	The Walmartrion is located in Folsom, California on Riley Street, I think it is.
5042485	5046367	That's where you will find a DDR solid machine in the electronics department.
5046487	5047668	In other words, way out in the middle of nowhere.
5047848	5049970	I want to hear if any other Walmarts are doing this.
5050210	5053292	So check your local Walmart and let us know if your Walmart's done this.
5054012	5054333	Maybe.
5054453	5055794	Maybe they moved that one on Lodi.
5055814	5056074	Who knows?
5056434	5060698	Anyway, I want to get back to the question I posed earlier to the chat room and read their responses here.
5060718	5061719	I've got a whole bunch.
5062219	5064421	So let's hear about some strange places.
5065522	5065742	Huh?
5067704	5068024	Let's see.
5074550	5080495	Zodiac Knight says the strangest place he ever saw a DDR machine was at a Tri-County flea market.
5082977	5084778	DDR Machine and the Flea Market.
5085459	5086580	The Tri-County Flea Market.
5089321	5092904	Baka says, strangest place you ever saw a DDR machine was in a pizza parlor.
5093024	5095465	Well, it's kind of a weird site at first.
5095545	5097767	But yeah, it's kind of common where we are.
5097787	5098107	Let's see.
5105262	5108024	Bumlover says, I saw a DDR machine in my butt.
5108164	5109325	Wow, that's so mature.
5109345	5110206	Thank you for sharing.
5112267	5117771	Nostylan says, Walmart once had a Beatmania 5 key before DDR became popular.
5117811	5118572	That was kind of strange.
5121033	5125256	SnubDisfinoid says, pump it up in the middle of an airport in Brazil.
5125296	5127358	Listen, like right in the middle of the fucking terminal.
5127938	5128539	That's kind of cool.
5128579	5130400	Pump it up machine right in the middle of the Brazil airport.
5134721	5138204	Jazz kind of cites a pizza parlor as well and the Beatmania and Walmart.
5141908	5143870	John Fields says, a pizza hut.
5144670	5146552	Would you like cheese on your pads, he says.
5147573	5149815	So a lot of pizza parlors kind of being a strange place for DJ Ranma.
5150055	5152377	I think the reason why the pizza parlor thinks... I know one, a McDonald's.
5152397	5154039	I've heard of one being in a McDonald's.
5154439	5154859	What, Loki?
5154879	5155280	Say that in a...
5158775	5173677	There's also, I was told this, there was a Beatmania 6 mix, I think, in the middle of the mall outside the arcade in Mobile, which I'm going to actually go see if that machine is there or not when I'm there.
5174293	5178538	Um, okay, I'm not even going to read that one because that doesn't make sense.
5179679	5181360	I said strange place to see a DDR machine.
5182422	5189388	Um, seeing a DDR extreme machine in the Metreon, says StaplerX.
5190191	5191132	That's a strange sign.
5191332	5194094	That is a strange sign because they held out for the longest time.
5195275	5200159	And then says a DDR machine in a bowling alley by my college.
5200479	5204162	It's in great shape because no one ever plays it except the occasional drunken bowler.
5204842	5209006	There's colleges.
5210807	5214490	Also, I'm seeing a DDR machine outside of the CBS studios in New York.
5215638	5221760	John Fields wants to remind us of that when the CBS Today show or whatever the hell it's called did their little thing on location.
5221900	5222980	And that thing was really stupid.
5223020	5224060	Yeah, it was really stupid.
5226901	5229781	Tapioca Express having a DDR machine, that was always kind of funny.
5229981	5231402	The one that's nearly dead now.
5234263	5235143	What was it?
5235223	5235383	The...
5236852	5239215	Dance Fever Dance Fever
5253732	5255072	They need to bring back StarCraft.
5255153	5258194	Oh wait, I remember one that they had that was kind of interesting.
5258494	5266396	They had a machine at the arcade in the Winchester Mystery House.
5267417	5267737	Really?
5268557	5268757	Yes.
5270318	5271338	I think it was short-lived, though.
5273539	5274719	Is it scaring off all the ghosts?
5275080	5275400	I don't know.
5275440	5279061	The fact that they have an arcade at the Winchester Mystery House is strange enough.
5283015	5283896	I don't want to go there.
5312046	5326082	and then, oh, a DDR Solo machine in the middle of the baseball field, Raley's Field here in Sacramento, has a Solo 2000 machine just right there out on the, what do they call that, the course, the, what the hell do they call that, where the, concourse, thank you.
5327520	5327940	The Conquers
5357091	5361075	The way the cage match works, just a reminder, we're going to play three songs for you guys.
5361415	5362376	You vote for your favorite.
5362396	5366780	The winning song goes into rotation on Orange Lounge Radio all week long.
5366820	5369543	So the only way you can participate is to be in our chat room.
5369783	5374567	www.calibermonte.com Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.
5375668	5378190	Alright, here's the first song you can vote for tonight.
5378391	5380713	And you only hear a clip of it because it won last week.
5381233	5389076	So here's a long clip of Above and Beyond with the song Far From In Love, tonight's first pick for the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match.
5390236	5404942	I can see behind your eyes that you're afraid of who you are Only silence now between us, I'm amazed we've come this far Far from in love
5417673	5418714	Thank you for watching!
5502885	5504906	All right, that was song number one.
5504926	5509069	Last week's winner, Above and Beyond with Far From In Love.
5532372	5534233	All right, second song in tonight's cage match.
5534253	5547237	You get to hear the whole thing, and it's kind of a long one, but it's Loki's pick, and he has picked for you... It's a remix, it's a white label remix of Broken Wings by Mr. Mister, and I guess this one's also by Emotion.
5547677	5564552	This is a group, and it's remixed by a group on the internet, well, it's a group of DJs, all women, called the Diva DJs, and it's pretty sweet, so I just found this today because I was looking for white label remixes, because I've got some really cool ones, and I don't know, just listen to it, it's good.
5565934	5568276	Explain real fast what a white label mix is, for those who may not know.
5569133	5572694	A white label mix is a non-official remix of a song.
5572774	5577355	It's not authorized by the actual artist.
5577395	5579795	It's more of kind of a thing that you'd find in a club.
5579835	5587157	Someone adds a little spice to their set by actually doing a live remix of something or making their own remix and then playing it on their set.
5587277	5588117	So that's where it is.
5589717	5591918	All right, here's song number two in tonight's cage match.
5592078	5596339	Emotion featuring Mr. Mister with a song called Broken Wings.
5596479	5596699	Enjoy.
5763932	5764478	Thank you.
6045815	6047376	Okay, that was song number two tonight.
6047516	6050036	Emotion featuring Mr. Mister with Broken Wings.
6050096	6051837	Let's go around and see what everybody thought of that.
6051877	6053717	We'll start off with our guest, Bradley, tonight.
6054918	6055638	That was okay.
6055698	6057358	I didn't really get into it very much.
6057378	6059159	I give it a seven.
6059179	6066621	I love the 80s, so it gets a ten.
6068142	6069422	It's one of my favorite 80s songs.
6070717	6072518	You know, I love the 80s, too.
6073279	6076321	But, you know, the original put me to sleep instead of that one.
6077001	6078723	So it gets a seven.
6080144	6082285	It wasn't a bad mix, but it was pretty damn repetitive.
6082965	6084186	I can't find my inhaler!
6084707	6089430	At three minutes in length, that song would have gotten a ten, but at seven minutes in length, it gets a seven.
6089770	6091491	I can't find my inhaler.
6091932	6092272	All right.
6093780	6099183	Okay, let's move on to the last song in tonight's cage match, which would be Jamie's pick.
6099223	6102644	And I noticed that Jamie is trying this artist again.
6103325	6106526	Jamie's picking an artist she picked last week, but that's okay.
6106686	6108787	CyberX is cool, and this one's better.
6109008	6111929	It features somebody else this time anyway, so it would be a different vocalist.
6111949	6113350	I don't know which one I picked, but I like it.
6113750	6114790	Okay, well, I'll tell you.
6114830	6117312	It's CyberX featuring Rupina this time.
6117352	6118932	Where the hell is my inhaler?
6119273	6119953	I don't know, Jamie.
6120842	6122984	Anything else you want to say about CyberX featuring Rupina?
6123364	6126427	Um, yeah, this song is cool and I had it on repeat ten times today.
6126727	6128628	Alright, here's song number three tonight you can vote for.
6128668	6130990	CyberX featuring Rupina with Like a Flower.
6131190	6131431	Enjoy!
6131451	6138276	Like a Flower
6151407	6152408	Thank you for watching!
6180864	6181648	Thanks for watching!
6293075	6294297	Thank you for watching!
6376972	6383135	I want to make my dream come true, it's right here.
6383676	6388618	No matter what the future holds, I will never give up.
6388858	6392460	I will live in the present.
6461076	6463158	Okay, that was song number three for tonight.
6463178	6466680	That was CyberX featuring Rapina with Little Flower.
6466980	6468461	Let's go around and see what folks thought of that.
6468501	6472084	Bradley, you're going to need to grab this mic unless you get up and grab Jamie's.
6472104	6473205	What did you think, Bradley?
6475767	6476547	It was okay.
6477008	6478649	Her voice sort of got it to me a little bit.
6478849	6480410	I didn't really like her voice all that much.
6480430	6482752	I give it a six.
6482772	6484733	Okay, Loki.
6486334	6486835	It was okay.
6486855	6487555	I give it a six.
6490401	6493722	I like that way better than the song you picked last week, actually.
6494042	6495983	Sounds very IU Trance to me, actually.
6496383	6498504	I seriously thought I was listening to IU Trance for a minute there.
6499744	6503085	I seriously would give that a 10, except I think it needs to be a little tighter.
6503405	6504985	Same problem I had with the last song.
6506326	6508886	So I give it a 9.
6509526	6510087	It's not bad.
6510447	6511307	I could stand listening to that.
6511846	6516528	I think I like best that it kept changing throughout the whole song, all the background did.
6517468	6519950	So, I give it a nine and a half.
6521250	6522831	I've been listening to it all day, so.
6524472	6526893	I want a trance version of the chicken dance.
6527973	6529094	You know, I have one.
6530234	6532875	I actually, yeah, haven't you been threatening to put that in for a while now?
6533996	6534516	Perhaps.
6534956	6535316	We'll see.
6535696	6537737	Okay, so let's review the three songs.
6538658	6538918	Rob...
6540209	6541330	You have it, don't you?
6541610	6542231	I gave it to you.
6542631	6542971	Somewhere.
6543131	6544152	Let's do it for the afterbirth.
6544493	6546334	Okay, we'll play it in the afterbirth.
6547516	6550318	Okay, let's review the three songs you can vote for tonight, shall we?
6550779	6552280	Let's start off with song number one.
6552340	6558106	It's last week's winner and the song is called, it's Above and Beyond with a song called Far From In Love.
6560788	6561509	I don't like that clip.
6568749	6575351	Song number two you can vote for tonight is Emotion featuring Mr. Mister with Broken Wings.
6575511	6576331	And here's a clip of that.
6587233	6593975	And here's song number three you can vote for tonight which is Cyber X featuring Rapina with a song called Little Flower.
6598525	6601787	Whoops, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
6601807	6603348	My mouse is being over-sensitive today.
6603368	6604109	Okay, let's try that again.
6612995	6614015	Alright, there you go.
6614536	6616317	There's your three songs you can vote for tonight.
6616997	6618679	Place vote now.
6619179	6623162	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
6623342	6628085	And we'll tally up those votes and let you know in a little while who won tonight's cage match.
6628888	6629768	Don't that sound exciting?
6631189	6633390	We need to do something else soon, too.
6633850	6634191	What's that?
6635511	6637172	What are we best known for, Rob?
6638533	6638973	Ranting?
6639093	6639873	The FUs of the week?
6640894	6641554	Yeah!
6641734	6642895	We'll do those in a little bit.
6642915	6644236	We'll do those next break or something.
6644636	6645976	What is Loki whispering to me here?
6646016	6646897	He's whispering something to me.
6646917	6648138	The FUs of the week.
6648338	6649018	Oh, FUs of the week.
6650599	6651399	I'm on top of it.
6651419	6652500	You have to be prompted.
6653320	6654621	I do not need to be prompted.
6655501	6655621	Okay.
6659252	6660712	Well, Loki ran off to the bathroom.
6660752	6663394	I was going to have him do a sim update, but I guess that's not going to work.
6663994	6669017	So, Jamie, what's going to happen when you... You're going to be gone next week, right?
6669237	6671098	I mean, not next week, but you're going to be here for next week's show.
6671358	6673039	And after that, you're gone for a couple weeks.
6673059	6674420	And you're not going to be back until episode number 70.
6675504	6683188	I may, I don't know that I'll be able to play the show, but I may have some degree of internet access.
6683568	6683748	Oh.
6683768	6684869	So at least be in the chat room.
6685249	6685489	Okay.
6685509	6686610	I'll have pre-shows done.
6686730	6689952	I'll have my cage match picks in case, you know, the winner don't.
6690352	6690632	Uh-huh.
6690792	6693053	So I'll be there in spirit.
6693553	6694094	Okay.
6695034	6698996	Maybe I'll eat some beef and pee so you can smell my beefy pee.
6699016	6699577	Hooray.
6700397	6701998	For those that were listening in the first hour of the show.
6702758	6703999	I said I don't eat beef.
6704079	6704999	I'll eat some asparagus.
6705420	6705680	Okay.
6705780	6707021	It has really stinky peas.
6707041	6707521	That'll work.
6709222	6715065	So, going off, let's plug the spin-off shows, what's going on on the spin-off shows, because I want to know what's going to happen to Pump Up the Volume.
6715945	6718166	Monday night's on the station, Vanilla Sky.
6718527	6722729	Tomorrow night we're going to be talking about some big news in the Final Fantasy world that came up this week.
6723169	6728312	We'll talk about that and Castlevania, full review and breakdown on our thoughts on the new Castlevania.
6728992	6733037	and other stuff that we usually talk about on Vanilla Sky, just randomness.
6734358	6740825	As I kind of compare it, it's sort of the Oprah show on Oxygen, the one that's like after the real Oprah show.
6741326	6743228	I do not watch Oxygen, I've just heard about it.
6744830	6745811	I've never heard of it.
6747833	6748474	Oh, forget it.
6749054	6750556	Tell us what's on Tuesday nights, Jamie.
6751175	6756880	Pump up the volume, starting at 7 o'clock with the pre-show.
6757881	6759162	I don't know what time my show starts.
6759182	6759962	7 o'clock with the pre-show.
6760983	6761804	7.30 starts the show show.
6762444	6764706	If you are in the chat room, you can request shit.
6765607	6767729	I'll play it, because I'm nice like that.
6768589	6778077	Although I may be doing requests, I may have to be a little bit more judicious, because I'm going to be recording this one, because it's going to repeat while I'm in Alabama.
6783291	6783772	Excuse me.
6785633	6787976	The week after, though, I'm doing the show on Monday.
6789597	6791179	Because I will be on an airplane on Tuesday.
6791419	6791579	Right.
6792120	6794142	So, our show is Swip Swap next week.
6794162	6795283	Yeah, we're going to swap next week.
6797525	6797746	But...
6800098	6803800	I've pre-recorded last week's show, and I'm going to record this week's show again.
6804461	6808224	And you'll get to hear them if you miss them, which you have no excuse to have missed them.
6809405	6809985	I kick you.
6810906	6814529	But it's over at 10.30, and you have to be in the chat room, or else you miss the full experience.
6814889	6816110	That's right, just like with this show.
6818312	6819853	Anything else to plug with Hub of the Volume?
6821658	6822318	Give me drugs.
6822719	6823920	Okay.
6824020	6828683	Wednesday nights coming back the week after next, if I'm not mistaken.
6828783	6829964	You going to be ready for it, Loki?
6830664	6831545	The week after next?
6833246	6833646	Yeah.
6834186	6835347	Week after next comes what?
6835367	6837329	I'll be as ready as I normally am.
6837649	6843273	Moving to Wednesdays is... I'm just kidding.
6843353	6843733	Live wire.
6844233	6847315	Lesbian hookers in outer space, Loki presents.
6849096	6849717	I like that.
6850464	6853427	We'll change it to bondage lesbian hookers from outer space.
6855569	6858291	And what happens on bondage lesbian hookers from outer space?
6858832	6863777	I play music while bondage lesbian hookers from outer space entertain me.
6867260	6867720	Sounds good.
6868481	6870343	November is going to be a big month for the station.
6871680	6873702	I swear to God we will have a new website done.
6874062	6875803	I have so many ideas for the website.
6875883	6877224	I want it to be so comprehensive.
6877564	6879906	I just fucking suck at designing websites.
6879926	6881207	We need pictures first.
6881707	6882348	Get the pictures.
6882368	6883188	Bust the pictures.
6883329	6884249	I want a website.
6884509	6885170	I want pictures.
6885310	6885970	I want a website.
6885990	6886891	Website.
6887251	6887832	No, pictures.
6888272	6889353	I'll take pictures right now.
6890310	6891051	I don't want pictures.
6892111	6892611	None of me.
6892732	6894353	I'll have to make some for you on Patreon.
6894373	6900076	We can just, like, do a picture of, like, some character from, you know, 2DX or something.
6900116	6901177	DJ Celica, there you go.
6901197	6904259	Why don't I just give you all the pictures I made of DarkSakura?
6905179	6905620	Wow!
6906800	6908181	Nah, I like my idea better.
6908201	6909282	You're not letting me off that easy.
6911113	6913835	Anyway, you're going to be the Junior Senior Robot now.
6914256	6918319	So I swear to God we'll have a new website this month at some point because I'm sick of the old ones.
6918419	6919841	I want to be the Junior Senior Robot.
6919901	6922783	We have a new location for the site that we're going to unveil too and everything.
6922843	6923484	It's going to be coming up.
6923944	6924544	We have all that.
6924945	6929389	And then we have some new specials we're planning for November.
6929409	6930750	We're going to be doing some new specials.
6931530	6936615	I just got an idea for one today that's going to take a lot of work, but it's going to be really fucking cool if I can pull it off.
6937075	6937756	So we're going to do that.
6938716	6938997	Yes.
6939756	6942099	We're going to work on that for November.
6942500	6947646	Also in November, the whole way you hear Orange Lounge Radio will probably be changing.
6947666	6948988	We're going to sound even better.
6949408	6953694	Even though you're still on a modem line, if you have an MP3 codec, we're going to sound even better.
6953734	6954695	That's coming in November.
6955740	6985235	and of course you can't forget episode 69 episode 69 and unfortunately Jamie won't be here for episode 69 but she will be here for episode 70 which I think is what I said would be the season 4 premiere but I'm not sure I'm not sure yet so lots of stuff coming to Orange Lounge Radio in November which makes sense because it's November sweeps alright we're going to take a break and I'm going to tally up the votes to the cage match last call for votes on the Orange Lounge cage match by the way while we take this break
6986500	6995867	The chat room is asking, since we're kind of doing these themed breaks tonight of a certain Bomani game, the chat room is begging, please can we do an Oha break?
6998489	7000951	So I'm saying sure, let's do an Oha break tonight.
7001011	7006716	So we're going to hear the Oha Ska, and we'll hear Why, the Zona song, and we'll hear Candy.
7009018	7009738	We'll be back.
7010419	7011640	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

7355908	7357269	Do we care what people think of us?
7357870	7359732	No!
7359752	7361173	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
7361653	7364556	Yeah!
7365737	7370762	Extreme Bomani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
7371823	7375066	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, also coming in November, new promos!
7375996	7376837	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7406448	7406988	Good God.
7407529	7411631	Tourney Mix 4th Plus has gone on DDREI.com.
7411931	7414392	So go there if you really give a shit.
7415472	7418554	I've lost all hope in Tourney Mixes anymore.
7418974	7420335	I really just don't care anymore.
7421015	7422296	I don't plan on entering them.
7422456	7423376	I don't really care.
7423596	7426218	I just... I haven't played Set Mania in months.
7426578	7428899	I'm waiting until my cabinet's done, then I'll play on that.
7430273	7436660	And to be honest, the Japanese people make better sim files than you fucking Americans and Europeans will ever make So shut up
7449733	7451474	There's only a few of you that are any good.
7451934	7452535	And you know what?
7452635	7453836	And you people know who you are.
7454316	7456777	So, the hell with all of you.
7457158	7457698	Everyone else.
7457798	7459459	There's only like, what?
7459599	7461200	Three people I... Okay, let's see.
7461720	7462721	We've got that Matt guy.
7463399	7465100	We've got, um, Utterdude.
7465400	7466100	They're awesome.
7466521	7469982	We've got, um, the people at DWI Insanity.
7470022	7471723	They make really awesome sim files.
7472243	7473924	And, of course, Healing Vision is part of them.
7474384	7476786	Those are the only people that make any good sim files!
7476866	7477526	You know what it is?
7477626	7478126	You know what it is?
7478346	7480828	Tourney Mix has turned into the new Parapara.
7481268	7484750	When it was first out, everybody thought it was cool, and now it's cool to make fun of it.
7485510	7489072	It's because they keep adding more and more rules to it, and it's just retarded.
7489632	7491313	But the thing is, also, um...
7492734	7493134	What was it?
7494575	7498456	There's another group that was pretty good, too, in making sim files.
7498616	7499477	I can't remember who they are.
7499497	7505219	It was like the DWI New World Order or some crap like that.
7505539	7506039	That was all right.
7506279	7512202	But the Japanese people make awesome sim files, better than you'll ever make, and they've been doing it for years.
7512582	7514263	So just give up.
7514663	7516684	Just stop, and that's it.
7517244	7521826	But, you know... Do people still make stuff for BM98?
7522990	7526793	Yeah, oh man, the stuff for BM98 is awesome.
7526853	7527373	I love BM98.
7527654	7537981	See, I'm sorry, but it takes a lot more talent to create something, a BMS file, for, you know, BM98 than it will for Step Mania or DWI.
7538021	7542044	I mean, we're talking like key sounds, they arrange it, they make their own, you know, song.
7542084	7545387	I remember playing BM98 before I'd even seen DDR.
7545667	7546808	It is just so much fun.
7548698	7549319	So awesome.
7549839	7557842	And, you know, I am so sick of hearing about Bomani Ruler because the guy supposedly quit making DWIs many years ago.
7558122	7563164	How many years ago did he say, I'm tired of people bitching about myself being too hard, so I stopped.
7563505	7564945	And yet he keeps making them.
7565625	7567546	If you're going to quit, you quit.
7567766	7570167	You don't keep coming back and then quitting again.
7570447	7571088	No one cares.
7571168	7573969	You're like fucking Michael Jordan, and he sucks now.
7575084	7577805	He's the Hulk Hogan of the Bimani world.
7578205	7579225	Just stop.
7579305	7581406	Just stop making sim files.
7581806	7591388	But, you know, the few people out there that make actual good sim files, you know, I'm willing to try a few new people out, but a lot of times they just suck.
7591728	7595849	You know, you get one sim file that's a 12-foot rating and it's just shit.
7596389	7598209	So, whatever.
7598369	7600630	I just delete the rest and, you know,
7601590	7602591	Play the few that are good.
7602691	7608258	You are no longer after creating the largest step file collection on the internet, correct?
7609059	7609559	I don't care.
7609920	7611241	It's just I don't really care anymore.
7612543	7619050	I download one of everything I don't have, but I'm not actively pursuing to have a huge collection.
7619090	7622474	You're not trying to have the largest step file penis on the internet, basically.
7623348	7624949	You just want to have the best looking.
7625289	7626590	No, I don't really care anymore.
7626670	7627990	Mine just looks nice.
7630831	7632872	My penis is quite nice.
7634633	7637595	But my Simfon collection, I don't really care because I don't play it anymore.
7638715	7640056	Well, not until my cabinet is done.
7640556	7642017	Once that's done, I'll play it again.
7643277	7647859	I don't need to sort through like 6,000 songs to find something I want to play because that just takes too long.
7647939	7649380	So, to hell with it.
7652046	7659735	Oh, and there's some pretty cool skins out there you might want to check out for Stepmania Trans Machina, which is a good one I mentioned back a while ago.
7659755	7661256	You might want to go check that out.
7661877	7664039	I believe it's in the Stepmania thread or skinning.
7664059	7664620	You can find it.
7665080	7669786	And then I'm sure there's been some Stepmania updates because DWI Denver updates, so screw that.
7670446	7671327	And if you go to...
7672808	7675090	I think it's DDRAmerica.com or something like that.
7675110	7677971	It's that BitTorrent site I mentioned a few weeks back.
7678352	7686957	They have the full set of, what was it, the full set of the Max 2 USA stuff already done, which I already downloaded.
7688598	7690780	You know, I could have done it a long time ago, but I just don't care.
7690880	7691260	So there.
7693361	7693662	All right.
7694422	7694782	That's it.
7695703	7696644	That's all that I care about.
7696724	7697124	All right.
7697978	7705982	Let's talk about, since it kind of relates to Step Files, let's talk about this whole Into the Groove thing that's coming out here.
7706582	7707562	Can you bring that up for us?
7713565	7714065	Yes, that's right.
7714085	7715666	We're going to talk about Into the Groove tonight.
7717167	7719068	Not the Madonna song, but, you know.
7719848	7723250	Okay, I'll take an excuse to play Madonna.
7723590	7723870	All right.
7724858	7726359	A few things that are good about this.
7726839	7728981	First off, you've got Kiel making some of the music.
7729001	7730482	Alright, what the hell is Into the Groove?
7730622	7731862	Okay, Into the Groove... Don't tell me what's in it.
7732003	7732983	Tell me what the hell is it.
7733303	7739908	Into the Groove is gonna be a new arcade software very similar to the DDR that's supposed to be hitting arcades.
7740668	7743610	And it's Linux-based, which... Whoop-a-dee-doo.
7743910	7746472	But anyways, it's Linux-based, which means geeks made it.
7746972	7748553	Big fucking geeks made it.
7748913	7749774	But, here's the thing.
7750314	7751215	Is it's, um...
7752135	7760540	is created by the same, it's created by Christian Ferd, he's working on it, and he's the guy behind Stepmania, so there's a lot of similarities to Stepmania on there.
7761800	7774828	It's pretty much a lawsuit waiting to happen, but they quote that it's, you know, it's very different from DDR, but looking at the screen, I have to differ, it doesn't look like it's very different at all.
7776048	7792286	and it looks kind of craptastic but anyways they've got some nifty stuff on there like they've got a mode where you can play where there's four arrows just like DDR but they're on the four sides of the screen and so the arrows are coming out of the center towards the outside which is kind of cool now it's a little different
7793411	7794371	Dizzy, Sudden, Expand, Stetmania
7812056	7813938	I don't think that's going to happen, but whatever.
7814258	7824988	That's interesting, because I see on this sample screenshot they've got Atom Bomb by Fluke, which is like that generic trance song that's on every compilation CD ever, but it's a cool song, so whatever.
7826129	7828231	Maybe got Atom Bomb.
7828991	7830813	And then what, Romeo and Juliet?
7830833	7832635	I've never heard of a lot of these other songs, actually.
7833375	7834035	Maybe you know these?
7834356	7834616	I don't.
7835036	7838958	But you said now, this is what's interesting, is that people in the DDR world are getting into this.
7838998	7841199	You said that Kiel is possibly having licensed songs on this?
7841219	7841559	No, he does.
7841899	7843300	And he's like, um, where'd he go?
7844540	7846881	I don't remember where I read this.
7847582	7848742	It says about Rockstar.
7848782	7849522	I don't know where to go.
7850443	7851663	He's on the staff, basically.
7851844	7852984	He's on the staff, yeah.
7853024	7854825	He's doing music on it, and Chris Danford...
7855565	7857066	is doing some other stuff on it.
7857806	7859747	Because we play a Kiel original song on his tape.
7859767	7861187	We've actually been playing it for the past two years.
7861227	7862268	I think it's time for us to change it.
7862608	7871591	But I'm just saying, he's kind of been known in the Bomani scene a little while for making some good originals that would be good for DDR.
7871611	7874532	So it's just kind of ironic that this is now going to end up in a DDR-style game.
7874672	7880834	Well, it's not too surprising because he has some of the songs, I believe, that are on...
7882495	7887658	I want to say they're on that Flash game, that Flash DDR.
7888058	7891240	Oh my gods, maybe they're licensed Neo Max.
7892681	7894842	Oh god, I don't give a shit.
7894862	7899604	For those of you that keep telling me that Neo Max is going to be in a DDR mix, shut up.
7900105	7900845	Just shut up.
7901205	7901905	Nobody cares.
7901986	7904667	That is like the most overrated thing ever, ever.
7904827	7909169	It's more overrated than... I don't know, but just shut up.
7910090	7910110	I...
7911823	7912484	Yeah.
7913845	7914405	Well, I don't know.
7914425	7917007	I actually think I may prefer Neomax to Max, period.
7917047	7918649	But fucking, who cares?
7919490	7926435	Neomax will never be on a DDR-type machine because they only put good files in DDR.
7927566	7931327	Okay, once again, this goes back to what I was saying before.
7931707	7938069	Why the fuck won't people let me put in a StepMania-based PC in a DDR machine and we'll just do it that way?
7938369	7951833	Since most of the DDR machines are violating copyright laws anyways because they have licensed music that's out of this country that don't share the licensing in the U.S., basically, you know, it's like an import CD or whatever.
7952768	7953168	Thanks for watching!
7969893	7977597	The only people that would bitch about it, ironically, are the people that love DDR, which they're shooting themselves in the foot, so to speak.
7978258	7982280	But I don't understand why they just don't do that.
7982580	7987883	In fact, I'm trying to push that on our local arcade here, but no one seems to be biting.
7991039	7995510	Do you think Konami is going to sue the pants off these people if this game ends up in an arcade?
7995530	7998137	Do you think Konami is going to sue the pants off them?
7998578	7998798	Yes.
7999701	7999941	Maybe.
8000814	8001975	Don't you think that's a little odd?
8002475	8002895	I don't know.
8002995	8003416	Will they?
8003496	8004676	Because the rumor is.
8004736	8005937	Now, rumor was a while back.
8005997	8007098	I don't know if this was true or not.
8007178	8007958	I'm saying it's a rumor.
8008218	8015102	But rumor was one of the reasons that Konami Arcade Mixes, you stopped seeing them, is because they ran into trouble with the folks that made Pump It Up.
8015602	8021866	Some kind of like thing where Pump It Up got the copyright to make dancing machines in the U.S.
8023006	8026008	Yeah, and Amiro, the folks that made Pump It Up, had the copyrights on U.S.
8026028	8026228	machines.
8026248	8028029	Even though they haven't done shit with it either.
8028509	8028809	I mean, God.
8030615	8034038	Yeah, but Pump It Up, it's just not as exciting.
8034138	8035679	I don't know what Pump It Up is doing wrong.
8035739	8037000	I can't put my finger on it.
8037380	8039402	It just isn't as good.
8039442	8044726	And I'm sorry if you're a fan of Pump It Up, but there's just something about it.
8044926	8047068	It's just not the same as DDR.
8047368	8047808	It's not.
8047968	8048889	And it's not the fact that it's 5.
8049710	8053593	It's just the interface, the giant screen, the songs are subpar.
8054974	8057536	I don't know what it is, but Pump It Up is not the same as DDR.
8059346	8067768	Anyway, so I think it was something like DDR sued Pump It Up overseas, and so Pump It Up got the rights in America and then sued DDR here or something like that.
8068008	8069049	That's the way the rumor went.
8069869	8072570	So would Konami really have a right to step in and sue?
8073210	8076771	Whether you did the Step Mania machine in some arcade or... Look at it.
8076811	8078251	Konami hasn't sued Step Mania.
8078531	8084333	If I were Konami, if I had written DDR, I would have sued the pants off of Step Mania years ago.
8086511	8092155	I was just going to say, as far as that lawsuit was concerned, it was basically, I think it was overruled.
8092995	8100240	That they were considered different, therefore, I'll find the stuff on it, but I believe that nothing came of it.
8102742	8105984	So, basically another frivolous lawsuit that resulted in nothing.
8106064	8106424	Hooray.
8106744	8108265	Hooray for the judicial system.
8113829	8121714	I think this is just people responding to Konami's, um, of America's unwillingness to make a new arcade DDR release.
8121855	8129420	People want fucking a new DDR mix, and I'm just so pissed off with the fact it would be so easy to do.
8129700	8138406	It's so fucking easy to do, and we can actually license the music because there's a loophole because it sort of would fall under the category of a, um...
8140063	8145865	AVM, what was it, sort of fall under the jukebox licensing rights.
8146245	8148186	Because it's kind of classified as a jukebox.
8148246	8155709	It's a very gray area, but you could license it for a flat fee of like $364 a month, or not a month, a year.
8156389	8158390	I mean, that's change.
8158870	8160031	That's like a buck a day.
8160631	8161091	A buck a day.
8161111	8163532	You can't tell me that no one plays that machine not once a day.
8164281	8167042	Hardware would be only a one-time buy of like a PC.
8167582	8169883	You know, we wouldn't even really need to do shit to it.
8170144	8171204	And upgrades would be free.
8173045	8175546	I mean, it's money in the bank right there.
8175666	8178107	And they're not jumping on it.
8178167	8184810	Instead, they're buying $1,500 bootlegs of really shitty, like, hacked DDR shit.
8184930	8186551	It's not even that good.
8186871	8188271	It's just all flawed like hell.
8189712	8191253	I don't understand why people aren't jumping on this.
8191373	8191993	It can work...
8192808	8220049	I'm gonna, like I said, I'm gonna, my proposal, I'm gonna do the Golf Land, I'm gonna try, like, show the Keith and stuff, I'm gonna, like, redesign, you know, Step Mania's thing to be just like DDR, have, like, skins and everything to make it the most convincing, um, arcade port, cause it's not like some sort of hacked shit where it's gonna look like crap, all of, you know, really nice steps for songs, full sets of steps, not this, like, one difficulty shit, you know, full sets of steps,
8220929	8238142	and all that stuff with no full unlocks and it's got you know you can hook it up so it runs off of credits like from coin slot it's it could work but you know people will be just like no because it's not official Konami but people are going to sadly buy this piece of shit machine and
8239042	8240463	You're going to see these in arcades now.
8240884	8243605	But to be honest, I don't understand why... Well, now give it a chance.
8243645	8244746	You haven't seen this machine yet.
8244786	8245547	It might be pretty cool.
8245627	8245867	Fine.
8246127	8249949	But still, I don't understand why people aren't jumping the chance to do something like this.
8250129	8253652	Because I know Keith, if he was still at Scandia, would have jumped on this a long time.
8254152	8257714	He would have totally gone with the step mania idea for the PC.
8257774	8258255	He would have done it.
8258275	8263238	Because he wanted to do... If I could find a way to hack the actual disk, he wanted me to go ahead and do that and...
8263812	8265313	You know, make a mix that way.
8266133	8266693	So why not?
8266934	8276358	I mean, if people can get away with making these shitty bootlegs that really look like bootlegs, why not try to make a convincing hacked version of DDR?
8278319	8278619	Whatever.
8278639	8283922	I don't know, what do you think, Jamie?
8283942	8285062	Would you play this new mix?
8285122	8289124	This into the groove thing that's kind of like DDR but not really?
8290445	8293026	I thought from the first moment I saw it that it looked really stupid.
8293906	8294486	So, no.
8296187	8299688	I mean, if it's actually released, yeah, and it's there, yeah, I might give it a try.
8300328	8303870	But it just looked really, really uninteresting.
8303990	8307431	I mean, it didn't even look visually appealing.
8309582	8310363	Here's my advice.
8311143	8319548	If you're going to do this and you're going to put your balls on the line or whatever and you're going to maybe get threatened by Konami, here is what I've been saying.
8319848	8322229	Konami should be doing for the longest time.
8322289	8325011	I bring this up every episode for like the past year.
8325091	8325932	This is what I've said.
8326312	8328213	This is how you can avoid the lawsuit and everything.
8328895	8330957	Make DDR competitive.
8331397	8335120	Make DDR a competitive game, and now it's a completely different kind of game.
8335440	8338162	Steal the dance magic mode idea, but make it your own.
8338443	8341465	You know, you're doing dance magic without necessarily doing dance magic.
8341765	8344507	Don't fuck it up like that one Dreamcast game.
8344527	8345468	What the hell was that game?
8345508	8351313	The one, the, uh, the shareware Dreamcast game that we reviewed on the show.
8351353	8352353	Dita Fury!
8352373	8353054	Dita Fury!
8353434	8353714	No.
8354155	8354415	No.
8354675	8355616	That doesn't fucking count.
8356337	8360098	Take Dance Magic, make it cool, there you go.
8360438	8368999	This is what Konami of America should have done, or Konami of Japan, anybody should have done six months ago after Extreme was done and they were done with DDR.
8370759	8378161	Konami of America should have put out, I don't know what the hell is stopping them, they should have put out a new American release by now and this is what's going to happen now.
8378201	8382381	Now they're going to go to court and sue these other people and if these other people play their cards right, it's done.
8382741	8385302	Konami of America is done in the arcades with DDR.
8389439	8389859	But I don't know.
8389879	8394961	At the same time, into the groove, it's probably going to suffer from the same thing that Pump It Up does.
8395321	8400584	It might be the same, but there's going to be something about it that you're just going to go, it's not DDR.
8401184	8402644	So don't try to be DDR.
8402804	8403825	Be something different.
8404591	8410518	That's why I'm saying go and be more like a competitive game or come up with something.
8410919	8412320	Think of something we haven't thought of.
8412500	8418608	I think if you put me in charge, if it was legit, if I could get the go-ahead to do something like this, I could make it...
8419680	8420942	Mix of DDR, that would be perfect.
8421322	8425007	It would just, the machine would just keep going.
8425087	8426669	People would keep playing this damn thing.
8427410	8430394	It's just because people get bored with the same songs and stuff in there.
8430695	8432597	They're bored with like, I mean, look at DDR Extreme.
8432617	8434460	It's been out for like, boy, like a year.
8434480	8435000	Almost a year.
8435681	8437262	You know, and people are bored with it.
8437382	8439884	You know, it's just like... Because DDR Extreme was nothing exciting to begin with.
8439944	8443666	Half of it, half of the excitement factor was old songs coming back.
8444106	8450010	The other half of it was a bunch of Konami songs that have been beaten to death in the ground already through other games.
8450430	8454393	Only a couple of the Transplant songs, I can think of maybe a couple off the top of my head...
8454793	8461079	Gummel and a couple and just these things that were like, you know, kind of they were lost in other Bomani games that became more popular again with DDR.
8461299	8467264	But shit like V and A, they were cool like at first, but now those songs are done because we wore them out with 2DX.
8467685	8469867	The Dance Mania licenses were weak.
8470167	8472389	They're the weakest they've ever been in a DDR game, ever.
8472629	8475932	The US licenses in DDR were better than anything they licensed in Xtreme.
8477972	8491446	I'm saying right now that pretty much the last thing I heard about DDR was an interview with Naoki that they did for this last DDR Extreme live party thing that they're reporting on.
8491466	8497132	Oh my, I saw they had a little thing there on there showing the song list where they're talking about it.
8497292	8501316	And it sounds like that Naoki is going to be working now on Beatmania stuff.
8502353	8514062	Strictly, because DDR is either done completely as far as arcade and maybe possibly home versions in the Japanese home versions.
8514703	8518025	It's either done completely or they're putting it on hiatus for a few years.
8519246	8521308	And they're going to come out with something new.
8524870	8527152	People want more of this stuff.
8527192	8530735	You're getting new fans to it and they're going to the arcade and playing it and they're like, okay, I'm bored now.
8531540	8533202	Maybe it's just different to us here.
8533662	8536144	But don't tell me DDR is dying in Japan.
8536204	8538406	Because we read it here on Monday on Vanilla Sky.
8538446	8538826	We read it.
8539067	8542289	DDR Extreme, one of the top ten selling games in Japan this week.
8542570	8544491	Japan, a highly competitive market for video games.
8544811	8546453	Extreme still lands in the top ten.
8546493	8548595	The home version, where DDR fucking sucks the place.
8548615	8550016	Don't tell me DDR is dying.
8550036	8550676	Look at 2DX.
8550716	8553579	They're like, oh, well, we need a petition before we release another home game.
8554540	8554740	What?
8556174	8557736	Unheard of here.
8557836	8560699	If they tried something like that here, I mean, granted, the U.S.
8560739	8564584	isn't Japan, but if they tried something like that here, they'd get laughed out of the country.
8568489	8569530	I'm just saying, you know...
8571178	8578542	The only trouble you're going to run into if you run a machine like this is you're going to get the RAA, you know, well these songs aren't licensed or whatever.
8578822	8580423	That's the only trouble you're going to run into.
8580443	8587306	Konami's not going to even give a shit about the fact that your machine is a bootleg or something like that because your machine isn't supposed to be over here in the first place.
8587406	8592749	Because you're promoting awareness for the DDR home versions, which is the only thing Konami of America gives a shit about right now.
8593669	8594430	Yeah, so I mean...
8595726	8598369	DDR Extreme or whatever, those aren't supposed to be over here.
8598389	8599830	Those aren't licensed for U.S.
8600110	8601992	And this is the hilarious thing.
8602092	8607497	Somebody made a damn good point, and of all places, DDR Freak this week.
8608378	8608958	I was reading it.
8610039	8617646	And somebody said, in the instruction manual to Max 2 USA, it says, go play DDR in the arcades.
8617987	8621410	It says, for the full experience of DDR, go play it in the arcades.
8623556	8625357	What the fuck are you going to find in the arcades?
8625737	8628518	You are not going to find DDR USA anywhere in the arcades anymore.
8628898	8633841	Tell me, somebody tell me in Nortel, where there is more Bomani machines than anywhere else in the nation.
8634821	8636082	Make it California, period.
8636762	8640164	Can anybody name me three places that have a DDR USA machine?
8640684	8642565	Can anybody name me three places with a DDR USA machine?
8642625	8643425	I can't even think of one.
8643945	8644566	Maybe the Metreon.
8644586	8645406	The Metreon, one.
8648078	8655477	When you're telling people to go out and play DDR in the arcades, you're telling them go and play the machine that says don't play it because it's illegal outside of Japan.
8658015	8659256	It just, it doesn't make sense.
8659696	8661657	They're preaching two different things.
8661837	8666580	They're like, yeah, this isn't supposed to be over here, but it's over here, so, you know, whatever, go ahead.
8667281	8678028	I don't think that there's much that they can do as far as, like, complaining that there's licensing or whatever, like, as far as music goes, because the machines aren't supposed to be over here in the first place, music isn't licensed, so you would run into that.
8678068	8682030	Well, that's, this is my whole thing, is why DDR USA, they're turning their back on it.
8682130	8683031	They're, you know, saying...
8683431	8689414	Just saying, oh, they're pretending they don't notice that DDR Extreme exists because they're not having to pay for the licensing.
8689695	8694838	And hey, all these great songs, we're not having to pay for, and they promote our home releases.
8695178	8701081	And if we try to do this, the RIAA sucks so fucking much that they'd be taking all our money to do these licenses.
8701161	8702042	It's not worth it.
8702162	8702882	It's not worth it.
8703162	8704923	Have Japan license the songs for us.
8705904	8709586	I'll bet you anything that is the true reason why Konami of America...
8711807	8713727	They pretend that the importing doesn't exist.
8714127	8716568	Because then that way they don't have to worry about licensing.
8716728	8717508	It's all on Japan.
8718249	8723770	And then if an artist or a record label comes back and says, I'm seeing these things all over America.
8724710	8725611	That's out of our control.
8725831	8727171	The Japanese movement, that's out of our control.
8727191	8729292	We can't stop them from importing.
8729352	8733413	And to be honest, I think you would get in real trouble if you started selling.
8733453	8734313	Say I made a new mix, okay?
8736607	8737228	We have a new mix.
8738008	8739530	I have already a logo done for mine.
8739870	8742172	It's called DDR EX2, Extreme 2.
8743073	8746196	So, say I made this and I went and sold it on the internet.
8746316	8749940	That's where you get into trouble because you're fucking selling a bootleg hacked piece of shit.
8750500	8758728	Now, if you're going to run it in one arcade on one machine and there's only one place in the world that you can play this thing, I don't see what the problem is.
8759457	8760038	Thanks for watching!
8776011	8784841	I don't see where they're losing any money, because we know we have the latest version there, and they're buying all the official ones that come out, but they're not releasing it anymore, so it's just useless software.
8785281	8791067	It's like saying I take an arcade cabinet that has like an old version of Street Fighter in there, and I put another game in there.
8791468	8792388	It's the same damn thing.
8794070	8794771	As far as I'm concerned.
8795592	8798355	So, I don't see what the problem is.
8801127	8810733	John Fields is giving me a suggestion here about going to DDR Freak and looking at the California page and finding just how many USA machines are in California.
8810793	8816337	Okay, so 437 places to play DDR in California per DDR Freak.
8816417	8818218	Let's see how many of those have a USA machine.
8819959	8820900	Oh, and I just hit cancel.
8821420	8822121	So out of 437 places to play DDR...
8824281	8828104	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
8825422	8828104	And most of them are boomers.
8828405	8830587	Most of them are all boomers.
8830607	8831948	So 20 locations out of 437.
8853707	8856748	5%.
8854528	8856748	5% of all places that have DDR, it's a USA machine.
8857528	8866291	So if you tell somebody to go out and play DDR, 95% chance some newbie is not going to be playing a USA machine.
8866371	8868692	They're not going to be playing a USA-made machine.
8875154	8876814	Somebody's arguing how many I counted.
8877074	8878955	One of the places had two USA machines.
8879015	8879835	I only counted it once.
8879875	8881276	It doesn't count if they have two USA machines.
8882955	8886156	Because, really, if you look at it, most places have multiple machines.
8886176	8888736	They have Extreme and Max 2, and forget it.
8888856	8889236	Forget it.
8889356	8890796	Just, let's leave it at that.
8894877	8896057	I just, I don't understand.
8897278	8900458	It'd be really easy just, you know, to do this.
8900998	8904359	And, as long as people didn't make a big deal about it, I don't see what the problem is.
8904379	8909140	I mean, no, I don't see anyone at Konami going, oh my god, there's a bootleg DDR Megamix.
8909873	8911614	and they're selling that shit, okay?
8911855	8914376	They're selling a bootleg and no one's coming down on it.
8914657	8918840	So, I don't think... That Megamix we talked about last week with the solid green boxes.
8918920	8921021	Yeah, DDR Megamix, it looks like a piece of fucking shit.
8921061	8922943	People are buying it for our $1,500.
8923503	8929948	As far as I'm aware, it doesn't have any new songs other than Extreme, what Extreme had, even though it said it had all the fourth mix and all that stuff.
8930448	8937033	So, you're buying a hacked piece of shit and selling on the internet, on eBay where everyone can see it,
8938042	8954692	and Konami's not coming down on them for this shit because they don't care because it's not a threat so if I make one machine in California one machine in the fucking world I don't think it's going to be a threat so they're not going to come down on me
8956897	8959258	Bradley, I've been so rude, I haven't let you comment on this yet.
8959298	8962980	Is there anything you want to say about the DDR bootleg machine, all that stuff?
8963240	8966381	If I can untangle the cord from this fucking chair that likes to eat the cords?
8968262	8968622	Not really.
8969503	8970043	Well, okay.
8970864	8971224	All right.
8971684	8976046	Jamie, who's back there folding laundry, anything else you want to say on the bootleg machines?
8979523	8981665	I really don't have much of a comment on it.
8981786	8995340	I just think that, you know, if you look at, and this is honest, this is me, if I see a bootleg version on one side and I see an official DDR on the other, I am probably 90% of the time going to play the original.
8996361	9004402	I don't care if it's, you know, upgraded extreme or an extreme, I'm probably going to go play the extreme machine, and that's me.
9005023	9013844	But then again, I usually prefer to give my support to Konami instead of, even if it's Konami in Japan, instead of somebody's pocket.
9016184	9018365	If they're not making Apothena, that's still another thing.
9018505	9022906	I still will play the original over a homemade version.
9025046	9025286	Okay.
9026354	9027315	Alright, break time.
9027895	9029936	When we come back, we're going to do the FUs of the week.
9029956	9033318	So send those in over private message to Sky in the chat room right now.
9033399	9037741	This break, the theme is going to be DDR Euromix songs.
9037781	9039002	The old school Euromix.
9039542	9040343	We will be back.
9154962	9155443	Thanks for watching!
9207899	9211043	There's nothing more than this Tell me one thing more than this
9327475	9328716	Orange Lounge Radio.
9329056	9331198	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
9332038	9341365	Hello, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 66 in progress.
9341445	9351051	After a little bit of a heated discussion about the bootleg machines versus the normal machines and da-da-da-da-da, I want to respond to a comment that came into the chat room while we were on break there.
9352072	9354914	One of our new listeners, hello, Wampa164, had kind of a statement.
9357279	9363064	What I like this, how you said that to the people, designing the DDR clone running on Linux, we're huge fucking nerds.
9363525	9366107	Yet you're running a radio show that talks about DDR.
9366127	9369650	Okay, it's a joke.
9370471	9372213	You know, we're just, it's a joke.
9372313	9379179	We make the joke, ha ha, Linux is a nerdy thing because most, you know, Joe Schmoes run Windows 95 and all that stuff and easy run stuff.
9379500	9382002	So, you know, if it's programmed in Linux, it must be a nerdy thing.
9382862	9384943	We realize we're big geeks and dorks.
9385103	9386943	I take great pride in being a dork.
9387223	9388364	There's nothing wrong with it.
9388604	9390544	So there's nothing wrong with coding stuff in Linux either.
9390824	9391585	It's just a joke.
9391865	9394145	So, please, don't take it too seriously, okay?
9394846	9398047	Hello, I'm making a fucking arcade cabinet for the house.
9399727	9402168	I mean, how much more nerdy can you get?
9403868	9406149	Look how much money this game has taken from us.
9406189	9408150	Look how much weight I've lost playing it.
9431559	9435802	But look, I would not be living in this apartment with Loki if it were not for DDR.
9436462	9440124	I would not have Jamius, one of my best friends, if it were not for DDR.
9441885	9446008	I would never have gotten Bradley to ever say a word, nor met him, if it had not been for DDR.
9446108	9446688	You know what?
9447389	9450530	I met Bradley at AX playing DDR.
9451731	9453372	On the Expo 2000, wasn't it?
9455253	9457855	So yeah, he was that quiet guy standing there.
9460224	9463126	Meanwhile, I'm over there in my Joe costume singing Xanadu.
9463626	9465267	So, basically the point I want to make.
9465728	9475453	DDR is obviously, if we've gone to the extent to make a show near and dear to our hearts, so we put a lot of fucking effort into it, despite what you may think, because our website's out of date and all that stuff.
9475494	9479616	We put a lot of fucking effort into this station that nobody listens to.
9479656	9480977	But we do it anyway because it's fun.
9484151	9492794	When we have all these, so obviously we have some very strong opinions about DDR, and when DDR starts to go in a direction that we don't like, we knock it a little bit.
9492934	9496895	It's just like when Star Wars fans call Lucas an asshole because he does something they don't like.
9497495	9500316	Obviously, when all is said and done, we fucking love Konami.
9500336	9503777	Excuse me, there's a difference between Konami doing something we don't like and what Lucas did.
9503817	9505818	Okay, I'm just trying to make a broad comparison.
9506018	9507678	Obviously, we fucking love Konami.
9508098	9511019	If it were not for Konami, we wouldn't have DDR, we wouldn't have all this great music.
9511059	9513000	Konami Originals is some of the best music in DDR, but...
9513593	9519039	When they make bad decisions, we're going to call them on it because they're affecting a game that means a lot to us.
9519780	9521341	So that's kind of the purpose behind this show.
9521681	9533734	We slam DDR a lot on this show, but when all is said and done, we're only pointing out the flaws we see because the game means so much to us in the end.
9534952	9535192	Okay.
9537753	9538693	Let's see, what was the other comment?
9538733	9541154	I want to be fair and kind of give the whole comments here.
9542134	9555637	Some people commented that Konami doesn't care, but Monty went to pretty good lengths to listen to what the Konami community wanted with the public beta test and the poll they made to see that people wanted back, which might be primarily responsible for seeing Rhythm and Police again on a mix.
9555837	9557718	Hey, if you listened to the show a couple weeks ago...
9558741	9561483	I said, Max 2 has the best licenses.
9561763	9563624	They did listen to what the people want.
9563804	9565566	People said, We Want Heaven by DJ Yano.
9565586	9566266	They put it on there.
9566326	9567287	It's a pretty sweet song.
9568047	9574271	So, you know, Konami of America doesn't completely fuck up one after another time.
9574731	9581456	But it's just kind of like what's frustrating sometimes is that Konami, when they do things, they do it so well, why won't they keep doing it?
9583117	9584418	Why won't they make new mixes?
9584518	9586379	I'm sorry, what were you saying?
9587611	9587831	What?
9588752	9589532	What do you think I said?
9589612	9592714	Okay, here's what I don't understand, okay?
9593235	9601520	The whole thing with DDR3, my mom was like, yes, they're going in the right direction, you know, they're getting input from the fans, no... Come in!
9603862	9604482	Hello.
9604703	9605023	Hi.
9605763	9614049	Okay, anyways, so they're getting input from the fans and everything, and they're like, oh yeah, we're starting over, we're doing this, and they're like, ha, no we're not, it's like...
9615228	9616589	Giving the players blue balls.
9616709	9617650	That's pretty much what it is.
9617710	9620092	It's like you're getting them all psyched up for this new thing.
9620372	9621473	They're just going to keep going.
9621673	9624355	Then they're like, you know, we changed their minds.
9624395	9625676	We don't really want to do that anymore.
9627217	9628398	It's just really annoying.
9628958	9630159	They frustrate the players.
9632406	9632686	All right.
9634307	9635228	So, bottom line.
9635748	9636268	Look at us.
9636589	9637189	We're dorks.
9637589	9638150	We don't care.
9638410	9641832	Yes, we have a radio station dedicated to DDR, and you know what?
9641852	9642632	We like it that way.
9642672	9648476	Because DDR has affected our lives so much, we feel the need to talk about it three hours a week, in some cases more, with our spinoff shows.
9649977	9652799	So when DDR does something we don't like, we're going to point it out.
9654119	9654720	End of story.
9655436	9662363	And we're going to give our kind suggestions in a comical way because this is radio and we want you people to have something to listen to.
9662403	9668129	If we were just sitting here, well, I see that we're going to have the new Max 2 out in a couple months.
9668809	9669910	And, you know, it would be boring.
9670110	9673193	So obviously we've got to say things that are going to piss people off because that's what radio is all about.
9673213	9675636	It would be like watching Masterpiece Theater.
9675796	9676216	Exactly.
9676577	9676837	All right.
9677297	9677818	I think we're done.
9678581	9679281	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
9702955	9708157	We got so much on another tangent here that we didn't even announce the winner of the Orange Lounge Cage Match.
9708517	9717161	Here it is, tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge Cage Match, by quite a large margin I must say, is coming from a person who I don't think has won the Cage Match in a while.
9717361	9718701	Jamie, your song won tonight.
9719082	9719882	Good job.
9719962	9721363	Cyber X with Little Flower.
9721663	9722103	Thank you.
9723041	9723641	You love me.
9723881	9724962	You all really love me.
9725682	9727242	I feel like going ferret squee.
9728523	9729583	That's good.
9729623	9730183	It's a good song.
9730203	9730763	I'm glad it won.
9731143	9731723	All right, cool.
9731764	9733084	So there's your winner for tonight's cage match.
9733124	9734104	Sorry I didn't announce it earlier.
9734144	9737185	We got kind of sidetracked.
9737205	9739346	That means I don't have to pick a song next week.
9739826	9740506	There you go.
9740626	9746768	We're going to get into the FUs of the week, so we'll stop saying FU to Bomani and we'll say FU to some other stuff real fast.
9747188	9750889	So, Jamie, why don't you explain the FUs of the week for those people who haven't listened before?
9751513	9754156	This is where we get really pissed off and tell you about it.
9772549	9776393	Um, first FU goes to my cough that will never go away.
9776973	9778535	I feel like I've been cursed.
9779156	9782319	So, fuck my lungs and my nose for being drippy.
9783400	9786323	Um, although I really do like codeine a whole lot.
9787043	9787323	Yeah.
9788064	9792368	Um, another FU goes to, uh, being sick at work.
9793409	9793730	And then...
9794660	9804522	Another FU goes toward the attitude of some of my coworkers that I'm contagious, which is absolute bullshit because it's just a sinus infection, which is bacteria.
9804762	9807042	If you're going to get a sinus infection, you're going to get it.
9809883	9819925	Another one goes toward not having any PTO left over after my trip from Alabama because I had to use half of it to go to what would have been my remainder going to the doctor.
9822259	9826743	Another one goes toward my car, still not being done yet, although they're making progress on it.
9828705	9833690	The biggest one right now goes to this headache that just won't go away.
9833710	9839876	Wow, that was pretty quick.
9840756	9841938	That's because I'm in pain.
9843459	9844160	Next up, Loki.
9849525	9850506	I'm eating spaghetti.
9851006	9851746	Dry spaghetti.
9853107	9859411	Anyways, um, F you to stupid drivers, because, um, you go too damn slow.
9860232	9862753	Especially when I have to yell at you, and you don't hear me.
9863333	9864294	That pisses me off too.
9864994	9867636	So of course I should guess that you wouldn't hear me since my windows are down.
9868416	9869017	But you should.
9869417	9871178	You should see me angry and move out of my way.
9872999	9875901	Um, F you to, uh,
9877130	9899576	Walmart for having a Solo 2000, because Solo sucks, so, you suck, and F you to the DVD video that I had for calibrating my TV, it's very boring, so, yeah, that sucks, I expect it to be exciting, exciting, okay, with
9902279	9906281	In defense of that video, it did have the electrocution and the fire and the alarm.
9908343	9909103	Okay, that was funny.
9910424	9914666	F you to Rob for encouraging the old Chinese lady for giving people out samples.
9915007	9916267	I had her trained really well.
9916307	9917568	She wasn't going to give me a sample.
9917748	9919749	Then you had to fucking go and ask for a sample.
9920250	9920850	God damn it.
9920930	9921610	What sample?
9923692	9925773	Okay.
9927520	9936986	God damn it, F you the fact that we have to do these on Sunday because I'm more violent on Mondays when I'm pissed off at things, but now, like, I calm down by the weekend.
9937667	9938467	It's just not fair.
9939668	9941149	So, whatever.
9941289	9941730	I'm done.
9941930	9943611	I don't have much more to complain about.
9944572	9956560	Um, oh yeah, F you to stupid high school whores because, um, you suck and we know that you're gonna get knocked up and pregnant and have some STD and then, like, collect welfare, so you suck in advance.
9958826	9959246	I'm done.
9959426	9959567	Um...
9988473	9991657	and a continuing FU to Comcast, the worst cable company on the face of the earth.
9992178	9993840	Now they're fucking over a bunch of my friends.
9993860	9995022	I've been reading a live journal this week.
9995042	9997565	Comcast has been taking people offline and all this stuff.
9998046	10000129	And worse yet, it's spreading.
10000609	10002292	It's worse than Gator.
10002412	10003493	It's spreading like a disease.
10003613	10004414	Oh, and that reminds me.
10004595	10005696	FU to lop.com.
10006994	10008835	I'll let Loki give the rest of this.
10009316	10011457	Lop.com took over this guy's computer.
10011677	10012338	Don't go there.
10012538	10013619	I swear to God, don't go there.
10013879	10015260	You don't want this thing on your computer.
10015340	10015860	It's awful.
10015920	10016941	It's worse than Gator.
10017321	10019203	It's like SARS for your computer.
10019543	10020504	First off, two things.
10021484	10022645	F you to Lop.com.
10023025	10024206	Well, it's not even Lop.com.
10024326	10027128	It's some sort of spyware program that got on my computer from visiting.
10027228	10028149	I don't even know what.
10028870	10030391	It just somehow got on there.
10031173	10036656	And it was a bitch to get rid of because you remove it with all the adware programs out there and it will not remove it.
10036696	10044980	The only way you can get rid of LOP is to go to their website, find the hidden link on there, and then download their uninstalled program and run it.
10045880	10046721	That's the only way.
10047101	10049282	Also avoid the program No Adware.
10050163	10052964	It's like called No Adware or something like that.
10053804	10055225	It is adware itself.
10056366	10056666	Irony.
10057606	10060147	I still vouch for the Seek and Destroy program.
10060627	10061247	That's a good one.
10061487	10062527	I've been using Attaware.
10062567	10063667	Attaware works well, too.
10063967	10070409	Attaware, and I have to use Attaware and then this one program called... Oh, I forget what it is.
10070429	10072829	The Seek and Destroy one finds programs that Attaware doesn't.
10073529	10081351	Well, I stick with... I have about three different pop-up programs running at the same time to avoid any pop-ups and get some still sneak through, so...
10083044	10084966	I'll tell you what, it's all about Mozilla.
10085526	10092673	If it weren't slow as shit, Mozilla would be the best, because you can block the pop-up blocking is smarter than anything I've ever used.
10092913	10094314	LOP will get in the Mozilla.
10094714	10098338	LOP affects Mozilla, Linux, and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
10099999	10102021	I have found, though, that I haven't had...
10102874	10109099	Nearly as much crap get on my computer since I've been using the Google Companion on Internet Explorer.
10110040	10118467	It has the search engine, the pop-up blocker, and an individual word search by every title that you put in there.
10118667	10127214	It's a very, very intelligent little companion, and it effectively blocks just by the pop-up that'll come through in anything it tries to install on your computer.
10127954	10129816	It's very effective, so I recommend it.
10129836	10130937	You can get it right on Google.com.
10133652	10137115	Okay, Bradley, you have any FUs you want to give him tonight?
10137536	10138156	Sure, sure.
10138857	10142020	Fuck you to not having money, because that's why Calum P.S.
10142040	10142981	had to take my stuff away.
10143781	10151028	He actually had options for paying like 90 bucks or something, but I had like two payments on Monday that I just barely can cover.
10151849	10156353	I had to let him take it away, and it'll take me like two months to get it back if I can ever get to that.
10157447	10165114	and fuck you to not having money because there's Papa John's Pizza ad right in front of me and it makes me hungry for it, but I can't really afford it.
10165554	10166956	You can turn it over if it helps.
10167636	10170839	Are you going to buy Bradley Pizza?
10171380	10172941	I'll buy Bradley Pizza one day.
10173562	10174062	Aw, that's very nice.
10174082	10174543	Thank you, thank you.
10175844	10176545	Okay, uh...
10177125	10190694	Alright, fuck you to the time difference between this coast and the other coast, because I fucked it up when I was emailing a person I was supposed to do a phone interview with, and then she fucked it up too, so we're supposed to have like... And then Daylight Savings fucks it all up.
10190994	10195697	Well, that doesn't really matter too much, but... No, I'm not strong-sided, you dip.
10196778	10197999	I'm not sad.
10198699	10200941	I don't... I'm hardly ever proud about anything.
10203129	10208152	I try to, I try to, I make it up sometimes, but I don't, I don't tell people about it.
10208212	10211294	Just, he's trying to be funny and he's not, just ignore it.
10212215	10214456	Yeah, well, he's trying to be funny.
10214476	10216778	He'll be fine if he does it in Portuguese.
10217178	10219299	Miserably, miserably, miserably horrible.
10219319	10221741	And, okay, thank you to that.
10224231	10231560	And then she said, oh, so I messed it up, so I'll have like 11 a.m.
10232461	10233142	on Thursday.
10234063	10238929	And so then, I think she called me at 11 a.m.
10238969	10241752	her time, because of my run running at that time, but I couldn't get to it.
10242881	10270201	and then now fuck you to Mailsweeper because her company uses that and it started thinking my emails were spam so I tried like four or five different times to get through and it kept from blocking them so I still need to call her to make sure that my last message got through which didn't seem to be blocked and hopefully it'll actually work out and actually talk to the person and then they can reject me for not being full of the customer service skills that they probably want
10272996	10273596	Let's see, what else?
10274376	10274956	Anything else?
10275837	10278198	Fuck you to chairs that make too much noise.
10278918	10284420	Because these hydraulic chairs, they're quiet at first, and then they start making noise on me for some reason.
10286241	10291363	And I'll wrap it up so people can get to the chatroom and finish it up.
10293024	10293504	That's it then?
10293784	10293984	Yeah.
10294244	10294524	Alright.
10295305	10296605	Let's move on to the chatroom FUs.
10297245	10298566	Fucking A, there's a lot of them tonight.
10301067	10304269	NoStylen says, My FU of the week is those people that think they're cars.
10304309	10306550	You know, those people that ride the scooters and the motor ones.
10306851	10308672	They get in front of you thinking they belong there.
10308792	10311874	I go, um, get out of my way, you're not a bike, so go on the sidewalk.
10312314	10314695	My next FU of the week is for my car not being fixed.
10314775	10318358	Again, my next FU of the week is spending over $100 for art supplies.
10318418	10320659	Again, FU for running out of ideas.
10320719	10321499	I need more ideas.
10321640	10322640	God, I'm sick.
10324301	10324841	It got cut off.
10324881	10325582	God, I'm sick.
10328464	10328504	Um...
10331545	10335287	EvilNaoki2DX says, My only FU this week is homework.
10335447	10336227	And hi, Ne-chan.
10338848	10339228	Ne-chan.
10339709	10340449	Sorry, I'm a honky.
10340949	10343990	Jazz says, I don't have an FU because I'm a happy little ho.
10344210	10346872	My FU is that I don't have an FU because I'm a happy little ho.
10348912	10351293	John Fields says, FU to humanity in general.
10352074	10353414	Yeah, humans suck.
10354875	10356536	Without humanity, you wouldn't exist.
10356976	10358557	You'd be in a world of nothingness.
10358717	10359297	You'd be a robot.
10360787	10365331	23rd Magus says, F you to people who think they know what's in my head and then proceed to put words in my mouth.
10366171	10370335	F you to Solo2000, you suck, you don't deserve to exist, you are inferior, good day, sir.
10371315	10376059	I disagree, six panel owns you, but whatever, you're entitled to your opinion, even if you're wrong.
10376159	10380202	23rd Magus continues to say, fuck not getting a call back from either Radio Shack or Papa Murphy's.
10380563	10382764	How hard is it to email me or leave a fucking message?
10382824	10383765	Die, K, thanks, bye.
10384185	10385646	When they don't call you, you call them.
10386607	10387248	That's my advice.
10392315	10395557	Wampa164 says, F you to teenage kids.
10397798	10403201	They can't drive, but think they have and deserve more rights and have no respect for their elders anymore.
10403541	10404662	Yeah, fuck it.
10406182	10407023	Kids today.
10409215	10413557	DJ Alcoholic says, as usual, I don't have any real FUs, so I won't bother with digging down deep to find one.
10413597	10422401	However, I do have to say, I miss my honey bunches of old Dark Child, who's away in Arizona because he's... Oh, well, this is serious reason.
10423181	10425882	Here I am making fun of her, and it's a pretty serious reason why he's in Arizona.
10427042	10431564	I just make fun of the cute stuff, but Dark Child's away in Arizona because his grandma passed away.
10433365	10435606	And he's been gone for two weeks, so I miss him, boo-hoo.
10436066	10437587	He comes back Thursday, though, so yeah...
10438553	10439573	We're sorry to hear about that.
10441374	10444676	And I'm only teasing you because I make fun of happy things in the FUs of the week.
10446416	10449078	Mintz says, FU to my college, I'll leave it at that.
10449118	10450918	There's too much stuff to go into specifics.
10451499	10453740	FU to anyone going to my college who is an IT major.
10453780	10456481	Y'all dumb fucks that deserve the piss-poor future you're gonna get.
10461452	10464655	LankyStyle says, F you to people who use the word asshat.
10464715	10466656	The word is lame and annoying in my opinion.
10466776	10467817	Oh shit, I just said it.
10468197	10469298	God, you're an asshat.
10469338	10470539	God, stop being such an asshat.
10471560	10473562	You are wearing your ass as a hat.
10474022	10474983	Stop being an asshat.
10480187	10483730	F you to the person who suggested switching Vanilla Sky with Orange Lounge Radio.
10483970	10485791	Because I'm not coming in on Sunday evenings.
10485831	10486532	You switch them.
10487886	10489167	It was Monday and Tuesday.
10489947	10490588	Hello?
10490748	10498092	Somebody else is saying that, remember how Loki said that he should do Mondays, or Loki said that he'd be better at the FUs if they were on Mondays?
10498112	10499373	That would be really inconvenient.
10499393	10500233	Yeah, Mondays, no.
10500413	10501494	Mondays are my night.
10501554	10502074	You can't have them.
10502274	10503955	This song is really inconvenient, too.
10504475	10508518	LankyStyle also says, oh, and in tradition, FU to this segment because I don't like it.
10509138	10512580	Irene has an FU for playing a stupid barber because she hates it, but she's weird like that.
10512620	10514261	Well, cry me a river.
10519045	10521851	Oh, God.
10523334	10525097	Snub Dysphonoid says, Fuck.
10529707	10530828	No, I'm not reading that one.
10530868	10532569	Sorry, that's across the line a little bit.
10533009	10536911	F you to the stupid high school whores that kept screaming about how good I was at DDR.
10536951	10538492	Thanks for announcing it to the fucking world.
10538872	10539373	I don't care.
10539673	10540634	Other folks don't care.
10540734	10544536	So why the fuck do you have to scream about how I got four grades on 1998 extra stage?
10544856	10545336	Guess what?
10545416	10547198	I don't appreciate it and I hope you get pregnant.
10549839	10551140	Then that means there'll be more of them.
10552218	10560580	Fat old fuck you goes to the nasty smelling shit logs to take my turn on initial D. Hey, how about I take a fucking broken bottle to your head, then we'll see how badly you want my turn.
10560600	10563141	You suck shit anyway, and you don't deserve life to begin with.
10563221	10564661	Wow, there's a lot of anger in here.
10566682	10569062	I know it's initial D, why are you getting concerned anyway?
10571043	10572243	After his, I have another one.
10573635	10574316	We're almost done.
10574957	10576920	We're getting the last, the straggling FUs now.
10576940	10579022	So that means I'm turning the music off because these are stragglers.
10579683	10584470	EvilNaoki2DX has one last FU to his USB wireless adapter for blue screening my system.
10587862	10591623	and Wampa would also like to say F you to MTV for being a piece of shit.
10592003	10595104	They don't even play music but brainwash our youth and corrupt them to shit.
10596605	10601547	Similarly, F you to the same teenage kids that can't drive but instead ride their shitty racer scooters.
10602287	10606068	Lastly, F you to midterms from Stapler X. That's it, last one, no more.
10607529	10611250	I just wanted to add that I just forgot what I was going to say.
10613778	10614479	Way to go!
10614919	10616039	Oh yeah, I remember what it is.
10616059	10619481	This stupid bitch on the Ragnarok Online community on LiveJournal.
10620342	10621342	Her account got banned.
10622283	10623624	And her husband's account got banned.
10624924	10625305	And you know...
10626127	10628949	Well, the thing is they don't know and Gravity's not replying back.
10629409	10634253	The thing is, though, I understand that I would be upset if my account were banned.
10636134	10643719	But apparently she did not check the ban list to see if it was a temporary ban or a permanent ban.
10644239	10648082	She did not stop to think that because they've recently been hacked...
10649362	10654485	This could be a maintenance issue and that their accounts will be reinstated once they've completed whatever it is that they're doing.
10656105	10661268	Instead, she's acting rude to everybody on the list and acting like this is her life.
10662468	10663549	It's a stupid game.
10664069	10667951	So if you think we're assholes when it comes to DDR, go look at this community.
10669056	10675538	And you know, I would be upset, like I said, I'd be upset if I was unjustly banned, if I didn't do anything.
10676458	10680740	But she was just being really rude and nasty to people with no reason to do it.
10681020	10690383	When they were offering legitimate suggestions, things that she can do, the different solutions to her problem, but all that she wanted to do was bitch.
10691298	10699482	about the service, and she didn't even take any of the proper steps to be sure that it was indeed, you know, a true banning.
10699662	10701823	Like I said, it didn't have to do with the maintenance or anything.
10702223	10703564	This person was so stupid.
10703904	10716570	Just go to LiveJournal.com, users slash Wagner Rock online, and it's probably one of the older ones now, but she's a really stupid bitch and needs to be slapped upside her head.
10717971	10718932	Just for being stupid.
10719393	10721936	She doesn't deserve her Ragnarok online anyway if she's that addicted to it.
10721956	10723097	Are you going to slap her with your dick?
10724539	10725340	I don't have one.
10725880	10727202	If you had your hypothetical dick.
10727742	10729625	I would slap her with... Your internet penis.
10729805	10731387	I would slap her with the Red Bull cock.
10732429	10734651	All right.
10735191	10741435	Speaking of LiveJournal, Orange Lounge has a LiveJournal community that is posted in once in a great while.
10741475	10744357	Well, actually, we've got quite a few people watching it.
10744838	10748400	There's some news and some questions that get asked on there.
10750001	10752203	It's username OrangeLounge, all one word.
10753018	10754959	Yeah, and there is a DDR one.
10755059	10758920	It's actually the LiveJournal community, Bimani.
10760100	10763881	I think there's also a DDR one, but it's kind of... No one updates it.
10764081	10765842	Just look for the Bimani one.
10766802	10769203	And on Dead Journal, there's DDR Maniacs.
10771703	10772404	Oh, pretty cool.
10774156	10776798	While we're winding down the show here, we're getting into the home stretch.
10776838	10778219	Loki, is there anything we missed?
10778839	10780800	You and I had tons of topics we wanted to talk about tonight.
10780820	10783282	Is there any last-minute things we forgot to talk about?
10783302	10784323	We did the UPN story.
10784363	10788605	We did the ranting about the bootleg machines and the new games and all that stuff.
10790426	10790987	He's thinking.
10791527	10792888	He's off in La La Land.
10792908	10795650	Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
10798563	10799644	Alter Mix goes gold.
10799704	10801045	I thought that was kind of old news.
10801105	10801465	I don't know.
10801506	10804027	Alter Mix comes out on the 18th of November.
10804208	10808431	That's going to be when I'm in... No, I think I'll be... Aren't you coming back right about then?
10809932	10811233	I need to look at a calendar.
10812294	10813054	I think so.
10813114	10814595	I think that's about the time I'm going to be back.
10814856	10814996	Yeah.
10815196	10816817	Oh, oh, oh, I have happy news.
10817338	10817598	Okay.
10817698	10819359	Oh, God, that hurt.
10819819	10821741	For old school gamers... Okay.
10822261	10826865	There is... For anyone who remembers on the Sega Saturn, the Sega Ages collection...
10828105	10838227	Well, in the U.S., they released multiple games on one disc, but in Japan, each game was released individually, like Space Harrier, you know, all those.
10838447	10847649	Well, they're doing Sega Ages 2500, which basically, for the PS2, it's remakes of old Sega games that were supposed to sell for 2,500 yen, about 23-something.
10847669	10848529	And they've released Space Harrier.
10856491	10861276	which I ordered, Fantasy Zone which is my second favorite game ever and so I ordered that too.
10861757	10863959	Fantasy Star was a really nice remake.
10865300	10866301	Those are the three that I ordered.
10866341	10872287	Then the other two that are out right now is Monaco GP and Golden Axe.
10873328	10881355	So the best prices I've seen for our most reliable site is toysnjoys.com, T-O-Y-S-N-J-O-Y-S.com.
10881795	10882856	They're located in Hawaii.
10882876	10883737	They have really fast shipping.
10884618	10885639	And they're selling it for $25.
10887901	10893265	But I just had to make the mention for all the old school people because it's really neat that they're doing that.
10893585	10893706	Okay.
10896246	10896806	Joy of Joys
10923442	10924022	It doesn't matter.
10924082	10926123	It's a song that's in DDR.
10926143	10927163	It's a new mix.
10927243	10931145	Yeah, but is that some fanboy's wet dream, or is that something that's actually been documented somewhere?
10931245	10931645	It's documented.
10931665	10932605	Like, was that announced somewhere?
10932625	10933165	Yeah, it was announced.
10933625	10935086	All right.
10935106	10936086	DDR UK is all over it.
10937527	10937767	So.
10938367	10939928	Because I believe anything they say.
10941308	10943549	Well, they're pretty on top of it for Euromix.
10943589	10944189	Yeah.
10944969	10947230	For most DDR news sites, they're pretty respectable.
10947550	10950031	Yeah, I mean, they've got the UK end covered.
10954966	10955507	Let's see.
10957010	10960215	Well, if that's all the news you got, I guess we can go ahead and wrap up the show here.
10960235	10963160	Yeah, that's all the news I can think of.
10964178	10965278	All right.
10965319	10968240	Let's go around and see what everybody's... Oh, and Jamie would like this.
10968420	10971721	They're selling second mix machines on eBay right now, a couple of them.
10973142	10973642	I don't remember.
10973662	10974242	It wasn't like $4,000.
10974342	10978024	It was some insane amount you could get an extreme machine for.
10978524	10982766	The thing is that Dan and I have sat down and talked about what made it official.
10983026	10984407	We're buying our house in the spring.
10985868	10988511	Actually, next spring we're buying our house.
10988631	10990793	We will have a house and we will have a DDR machine.
10992195	10993957	But the thing is, we're probably going to have an extreme.
10994697	10995739	Why not a second mix?
10996479	10998461	Because you can't grade a second mix.
11000203	11001184	Get bootleg third.
11002265	11003407	Korean, third Korean.
11003487	11004668	No, I do not want the third.
11004908	11006470	If I get a third mix, it's going to be a third plus.
11007408	11007688	Whatever.
11008309	11008629	All right.
11009530	11011492	Okay, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
11011532	11012472	Now the show's wrapping up.
11012533	11014534	Bradley, we'll start with Bradley, our guest for this evening.
11014975	11016436	He hasn't said much, but that's okay.
11017377	11018297	That's what he's known for.
11020059	11020359	All right.
11020719	11023161	Be active, not passive.
11023341	11027185	Let my performance today be an example of what not to do.
11030549	11031690	Loki, final thought.
11031710	11033852	I'm going to be done with my cabinet this week.
11034873	11035834	Didn't you say that last week?
11036895	11037936	No, really this time.
11037956	11039618	No, no, really.
11039918	11040659	I swear I'm going to be done.
11041159	11042761	Well, with part of it at least.
11042821	11046645	I'll be done with the major cutting of the cabinet.
11046665	11051409	Will we actually have a wooden, empty cabinet at the end of this week?
11051790	11052470	Possibly.
11052610	11053191	I'm thinking...
11054412	11056333	The battery power is the only thing stopping me.
11056854	11058555	I have, like, all the sheets I have.
11058615	11059896	It can't take the power!
11060356	11063218	Yeah, all the sheets I have left to cut are just rectangular.
11063298	11065520	So, I mean, it's not anything complex or anything.
11066160	11067561	And then it's just putting it together.
11067742	11068782	That's pretty much it.
11069423	11070944	You know, it's not much left.
11072425	11074086	So, maybe.
11074246	11075827	Maybe we'll have a cabinet by the end of the week.
11075847	11076188	Who knows?
11076828	11077388	I'll be waiting.
11079030	11080090	Jamie, your final thought.
11081972	11082152	Ow!
11082172	11082212	Ow!
11085365	11091268	My final thought is I'm so happy I only have to work two days next week.
11091688	11092468	That makes me giddy.
11092928	11094069	And you don't have to work a full week.
11094949	11097550	I wouldn't exactly call what I do work, but sure.
11097630	11100771	I get two weeks off in a row, huh?
11100791	11101072	Blimey.
11101612	11101972	All right.
11102772	11103233	That's it.
11103373	11104633	Final word of the show tonight.
11106454	11108655	Nellie, you want to take a stab at one word, Nellie?
11108795	11109655	Can you say one word?
11110155	11110576	Just one?
11110996	11111376	No.
11111396	11111436	No.
11114967	11117349	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

11124434	11127195	And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
11173667	11175788	Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.
11205766	11209187	Orange Lounge Radio, The Afterbirth, the part after the credits have faded out.
11210807	11214088	A little bit of WTF to tonight's fortune cookie, Jamie.
11214148	11214788	Explain yourself.
11216168	11231091	I was going through my waves and I could not decide on one, so I picked the Sailor Stars transformation from the last season of Sailor Moon, in Japanese, of course, which I actually thought was a pretty good series because they killed Chibiusa.
11232421	11233902	Except they bought in Chibi Chibi.
11234382	11235582	And she needed to die too.
11236283	11238744	Yes, I was a Sailor Moon fan once.
11239564	11241425	When it was like new.
11244426	11246067	I watched a couple episodes of it once.
11246947	11248388	You watched the crap version.
11249188	11253850	I have like, I can show you some quality Sailor Moon.
11256731	11258732	Quality Sailor Moon, isn't that a bit of a, no.
11260453	11261353	I like Tuxedo Mask.
11263960	11268721	Tuxedo Common But the guy they have playing him in the live action series is ugly!
11269442	11270162	He's ugly!
11270242	11272182	I don't care what everybody else is going to say, he's ugly!
11274503	11278504	Alright, anything else you guys want to say in this little portion after the credits have faded here?
11282486	11290348	Ow, my head hurts I smell like sawdust At least you don't have pee beef
