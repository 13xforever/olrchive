9591	13750	Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
17375	22237	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the mommy talk and then some.
22937	25638	Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.
25998	30020	Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.
30660	35442	Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.
36022	39743	You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
40064	41524	Yes, I will spank your child.
41924	43665	If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.
45494	46742	What else?
49372	50513	Here's to my big opening.
51033	52154	A sphincter says what?
52394	54456	Some trooper thinks they're asking.
54836	57418	Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.
57438	59319	What am I doing here?
59499	60720	No.
61301	61941	Dodge this.
62021	64963	This is a tasty burger.
65223	67665	Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.
67885	68506	Yes, I have.
68946	70747	Look, just a flesh wound.
70987	77132	Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.
78169	78889	Oh yeah?
79109	82430	Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.
82650	83730	DarkSakura.
83910	84831	I've got a sniff.
85071	85611	Sky.
85711	87811	But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.
88171	88672	Loki.
88952	89952	I hate you!
90372	92452	Orange Lounge Radio.
94753	95733	We are live.
96573	100134	This is episode number 65 for October the 19th.
100474	101255	Live 65.
101895	102715	Of 2003.
104215	106916	If you thought last week was a blah show, just wait for tonight.
108962	111928	You're tuned in to the Bee Money Scenes.
112689	114673	Most sick radio station of all things.
114733	115695	Bee Money.
115815	116276	Are you sick?
118089	119650	The whole damn world's sick today.
120751	122912	Well, you're always sick, but I mean, like, physically ill.
125073	125754	Not mentally ill.
125934	126674	I'm both.
126754	130897	I'm physically, mentally, and I'm sick and abusive.
130917	132457	Why did I come over here?
132578	134018	I'm past the contagious stage, I'm fine.
134058	134579	Okay, sure.
134599	135439	Can I do the intro?
135759	136960	Can I do the intro and stop?
137160	139862	Won't you people let me do my job here?
140402	141763	Okay.
144064	145305	My name is Rob Roberts.
145325	146506	You might know me as Skye.
148359	151320	Joining me as always are half of my awesome co-hosts.
151500	156542	In this corner, empty corner, the sickest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers.
156562	157183	You know her better.
157243	159404	DarkSakura is out sick today.
159984	160564	I had a sniff.
162325	166186	Now, you tell me, hold on, I'm going to stop this for a minute.
166206	174410	You tell me, if both me, Loki, and Jamie are all sick, what does that tell you?
177080	178920	Somebody here last Sunday was sick.
179001	179961	That's what I'm trying to get at.
180581	182861	I don't know, but I have a feeling you guys are all having sex.
184322	185222	That's why you're all getting sick.
185262	194144	Well, it could be that there's a cult going around anyways, and more than one people, you know, you know, a ton of people have it, because there's people at my work that had it before me.
194804	197405	So, it's obviously not just one person.
198430	199570	It could be totally unrelated.
199850	202171	Especially when you work at a large place like you do.
202351	205112	Or it could be what the most obvious answer is.
205212	207393	It's a government conspiracy to shut us down.
207813	214195	They have had bioterrorists come in and poison our food supply.
215115	216216	Thank God I ate it all.
219417	220857	Yeah, we don't have a lot of time left.
223118	223898	Alright, um...
226036	226416	Oh, hey.
226436	227077	Come in.
227097	227637	Knock on the door.
227677	228838	Yay, another well person.
229839	230279	Hey.
230379	231520	Now we can get him sick.
231540	233041	Now we can get him sick, too.
233781	236783	All right, let me finish the intro here.
239145	239505	See?
239845	245209	She got sick from work, so... Nelly.
247130	248251	What happened to our intro?
249012	249632	You stopped it.
250092	252134	Yeah, but I'm trying to play it again, and now it won't go.
252514	253975	Well, you should have stopped it.
254275	254796	Oh, shit.
255569	262793	All right, well... All right, all right, all right.
263293	264374	Just forget the intro.
264394	264754	Forget it.
264994	265334	Forget it.
268176	268576	All right.
270737	272738	So Jamie's not here, but she is in the chat room.
273576	276017	So if you want to say hello and wish her to get better soon.
276578	276918	Hello.
277518	278359	Our mics are too loud?
278879	279539	I turned them down.
279579	280240	Are they too loud?
280260	280820	I turned them down.
280840	282601	Are they too loud?
283161	283541	Stop it.
283721	284062	Sorry.
285282	285722	Thank you for that.
285742	287143	I haven't even introduced everyone yet.
287723	288424	I think they all know.
288684	289044	Ah, well.
289104	289824	We've got to introduce.
289844	290785	Do the introductions anyway.
290825	292606	Okay, Jamie's out sick, but she's in our chat room.
292826	294207	www.callybomani.com
294767	296408	Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.
296428	303092	Say hello, wish her to get better soon, and watch her berate you over typing instead of verbally tonight.
303573	304033	Alright.
304894	306054	Okay.
306134	308356	In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.
310157	311138	Hello again.
316701	319123	Not only are we sick, but we're bitchy and irritable.
319663	320864	How is it any different than usual?
325733	333641	Also with us tonight, filling in because he's so generous for the lack of a third person tonight, say hello to LankyStyle, also known as Brad.
334041	335523	Hello LankyStyle, also known as Brad.
336944	341509	And then in that corner, say hello to Brad Lee, also known as Arcadian42.
341529	347835	How are you doing, Bradley?
348345	348965	Okay, good.
350146	352347	Usually we'd still have music playing right now, but I fucked up.
352367	353167	He can talk, he can sing.
353187	354768	Wait, I think I can get music back now.
355388	356008	Hold on, hold on.
357569	358449	Yes, there we go.
361150	365252	We'll be talking to all of them more a bit later, but first, we're going to take a quick break.
365272	365852	Don't do that.
366733	369154	Don't do that stupid, wacky DJ stuff.
371932	374154	I honestly don't know how we're going to make it three hours tonight.
374214	374734	I really don't.
375915	377197	Loki says he's got the ideas.
377937	379839	I think I'm just going to turn this show over to Brad.
380599	380780	What?
381120	381800	Which one?
381820	382141	Bradley?
382221	382841	Okay, here, Bradley.
382861	383622	Both of you.
383642	383922	Come here.
387065	389967	Yeah, I'll take the mic outside and we'll just sit there and smoke all night.
390328	393370	And I'll get the sound effects of cigarettes burning.
393851	394171	Hooray.
396992	398612	Oh, Loki wants to take the show outside.
398632	399373	Are you threatening me?
399513	400793	No, we can't go outside.
400813	402993	Then we'll get the outdoors sick.
403033	405674	We'll get kicked out of the apartment complex.
407254	408274	All right, we'll be back.
408294	409475	We've got the money news.
409575	410155	How was your week?
410175	411155	How was your day?
411635	414096	Cage match, FUs, all that fun stuff coming up.
414976	415456	We'll be back.
427142	431526	Will we be together again?
433928	438052	Thought the love we had was strong
439937	445523	Tell me what's wrong, what did we go wrong?
508576	510624	And tell me what's wrong What did we go wrong
562572	563975	Thank you for watching!
596068	598753	Thank you for watching!
678424	679324	Thanks for watching!
708557	713278	Niko Meow Niko Meow Niko Meow Meow Meow Meow
738243	740807	This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.
744437	748118	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, all ye faithful listeners.
748678	749358	You know what's funny?
750059	753539	During that break, I'd say, you know what's funny?
753680	759681	I looked at the numbers of how many people are listening to the station as we were on break, and I'd say about 15% of them dropped.
760941	765743	Because they probably heard that intro where we're just like, we're sick and we don't give a fuck today.
766103	767303	And they're probably just like, fuck it.
767783	769744	If it's going to be one of those shows, fuck it.
770584	773645	So thank you guys for sticking on board, ye faithful ones.
774199	775821	or just live 365 servers.
775861	776342	Drop them.
776702	780146	Or they're just hardcore Jamie fans and they're pissed that she's not here tonight.
780186	780567	I don't know.
780667	781788	That too.
781828	782830	Most likely that's what it is.
782850	785693	There's going to be a special appearance by Jamie in one way or another.
785753	786875	We're trying to work something out.
786935	787956	Because she's in the chat room.
788336	789277	She's cameoing in the chat room.
789297	790379	How do you have a special appearance?
790399	791780	Is it going to jump through the matrix?
792721	793502	Something like that.
793722	795363	We'll see if we can arrange something later.
795763	799185	We'll see if we can arrange a special visit by a sick Jamie.
799705	804328	And when she's sick, she's twice as bitchy, so if we can get her in for the FUs, that'll be great.
807009	812172	So, anyway... No, it won't require you doing any work.
812652	813052	You're fine.
815234	817635	Because you're sick too, Loki, and I don't want you to have to do work.
819209	819909	Oh, you're not that sick?
820049	820510	Oh, great.
820730	822830	Why don't you do the show while I go take a nap?
824171	826052	You sick bastards.
826712	828813	That's right, I don't get to take a nap because I was playing video games all day.
828873	830273	I was playing Final Fantasy X all day long.
830573	831834	Whoop-de-freaking-do.
831874	833094	Whoop-de-freaking-do, I know.
833114	835875	Good for you people who have American PS2s and can play that game.
835955	844799	For those of you who don't follow along, or I don't know if I've talked about it on Orange House Radio, I know I've talked about this plenty on Vanilla Sky, on the Monday Night Show, but I've been...
845678	847961	I'm rekindling my interest in Final Fantasy X lately.
848001	849542	I don't know, I'm about a year and a half late.
850143	853246	But for some reason I decided I wanted to play it and beat it.
853426	855849	So that's what I'm doing right now is I'm working my way through it.
856149	858251	Someday I should go ahead and beat Final Fantasy IX.
858932	860714	I never beat IX and I never beat VIII.
861174	862576	We probably should tackle that someday.
863439	871862	One of these days, it was like the last Final Fantasy I actually had the patience to beat was 7, and 8 like turned me off to Final Fantasy so bad that I didn't even buy 9.
871942	874963	Bet you didn't even go to Sea Spirits Within, did you?
875463	878384	No, I went to Sea Spirits Within and it made me even sadder.
878765	881466	So, that's basically what happened.
885787	890889	Anyway, so, on that note, let's play How Was Your Week and How Was Your Day?
892592	893373	I don't like Jury Duty.
893433	899617	I don't like downtown Sacramento, and I don't like the fact that Jury Duty is in downtown Sacramento.
914022	940898	and uh... the whole week sucked it was hell and no it'd be nice to say oh well you know jury duty's done so I get to you know go back to my work but no I have to go for the next at least two days so that sucks and I don't want to be there and but I gotta sit through it and do my quote unquote civil duty civic duty civic civil I don't give a crap think of a car Honda
942091	944534	So, you know, that's what I gotta do.
944574	945475	That was my week.
945555	946196	It sucked.
946376	947938	I had the worst day ever on Wednesday.
947958	949460	I just didn't care when I got back.
950561	957409	Then Thursday was alright because we got off at noon because they're still picking the jury because it's slow.
957970	958350	And then...
960031	960811	Yeah, I know this other thing.
960831	961812	They didn't kick you off the jewelry?
962752	965014	They didn't, like, say, sorry, go home?
965554	966934	No, they actually put me on there.
966974	970176	Wow, I, jeez, I got kicked off when I was on there.
970196	975439	Yeah, well, you know, they still have to go through, like, pretty much the way I figured, because I've never really been in one of these things.
975699	985844	They've got, like, 27 people they pick, you know, first, they go in there, and then they kind of go through and eliminate people until those 27 people are all gone or either on the, um,
986616	987797	No, jury thing.
988598	989258	In the jury box.
989398	998825	So, there's, like, still another, you know... They've only eliminated, like, four people so far, and there's still, like, another 13 people in the audience still, or whatever.
998845	999286	Jeez.
1000026	1008233	You know, and... So, I mean, there's a chance that, you know, I might get kicked off, but... Probably not, because my luck never runs away.
1008533	1009253	That's crazy.
1009373	1011135	So... Four people a day.
1012616	1015058	It's supposed to only take two hours, and it's taken...
1016653	1018795	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1039093	1043334	Thursday, they did it from 9.30 to, you know, 12.
1043535	1045755	So, I mean, that's... And still haven't eliminated them.
1045775	1050717	And they still haven't eliminated the people, because... They did it, like, in 20 minutes.
1050857	1053958	I'm like, I don't understand what's taking so long for this thing.
1054538	1059320	But, supposedly, they promised that the trial's supposed to be short, so... Yeah, right.
1060380	1065082	Well, they've only got, like, four witnesses, as far as I'm aware, and so, I mean, that shouldn't take too long.
1067155	1067576	3D sucks.
1067776	1068618	Yes, yes, yes.
1069580	1070482	I just don't like downtown.
1070642	1076735	Didn't you mention when you were on the stand or whatever that you actually did a show called Orange Lounge Radio that you're a part of?
1077136	1077357	Yes.
1078257	1080278	Great, the government knows about us.
1080578	1081199	We're fucked.
1081859	1082860	I don't think they care.
1082880	1084020	Oh my god, you said that?
1084040	1098549	It was funny though, because the prosecution, or no, the defense attorney asked me as one of the questions, because they're pulling you and asking you questions when you're on the box, because I was talking about, they're all, so what kind of music do you guys play?
1098589	1098829	I'm like,
1099309	1100891	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1117627	1121030	So you said you were actually on a, did you say you had talk radio?
1121451	1127237	Yeah, and I think they would take that as, okay, we shouldn't have him on the jury, because he might go ahead talking about the case.
1127257	1138008	Well, I mentioned there was a talk radio station, and then I also, what was it, I mentioned, I was going into it, I guess I went into it a little too much, because the judge was like, did you want to give out your URL while you're at it?
1141489	1141870	Did you?
1142710	1143010	No.
1143070	1143450	Damn it!
1144290	1145331	Holy shit.
1146031	1146871	That would have been great.
1147651	1150512	No, but... Damn it, why didn't you have the business cards?
1150612	1151553	We have the business cards.
1151573	1154414	You could offer the judge a business card, he would have gotten kicked off the jury right there.
1154494	1154894	Come on.
1157035	1157855	And he would have had our URL.
1159622	1161443	No, I'd rather not.
1161783	1165825	But anyways, the defense attorney, though, she knew what we were talking about.
1165865	1169727	She's like, so what kind of video games do you guys talk about?
1169787	1170907	I'm like, oh, mostly the music games.
1170927	1174149	She's like, oh, like that game where you step on the arrows?
1174609	1175990	Wait, wait, I just have to ask real fast.
1176190	1178311	Did you have to define what speed music was?
1179011	1179772	No, I did not.
1180772	1181813	It's a bunch of crap!
1183834	1184614	It's a bunch of crap!
1211064	1214886	I didn't give it out to the whole jury because half those people I don't think know what a computer is.
1215507	1217928	Were you being interviewed in front of the other jury members?
1217988	1219209	Oh yeah, the whole people.
1219309	1220090	How many people were there?
1220110	1220890	About 27.
1220930	1221150	That's all?
1222728	1224550	Well, not including no jury.
1225510	1226671	Well, not jury.
1226711	1237540	Not including the attorneys, the defense, the defendant, and all the judge, the bailiff.
1237621	1239142	So basically you have no shame.
1239162	1240343	No.
1240623	1243025	I couldn't get up on the stand and say that I do those things.
1243085	1243405	Sorry.
1243686	1249851	I'd so be ashamed of this because they come on here and they find out what a big fag I am in like 15 seconds.
1251135	1254297	I don't know, for some reason... Wait, would they kick you off the jury for being a homosexual?
1255758	1256018	No.
1256558	1259080	Maybe if the case has something to do with that.
1259460	1265543	Like, they don't... Usually they'll pick a jury and they ask you questions and they're looking for things that may give you a biased opinion during the jury.
1265563	1266324	But here's the thing, though.
1266424	1272027	It's like... I don't understand about much... I don't know much about how the jury system works and everything, but...
1274153	1275094	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1288809	1289789	It's pretty much like that.
1290110	1293811	And they keep asking the same question until they finally said no.
1293931	1300914	It's because they can't lead the witnesses in the case, so they just lead the jury members to pick the ones they want.
1301654	1303575	It's a very slow process.
1303895	1304635	Very slow.
1305656	1310398	And I hope to God that we actually start the trial on Monday because...
1311155	1312616	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1334918	1345084	And so, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, lunch comes, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, it's almost time to go home, it's 3 o'clock, we get to leave at 3.30 if we're not called in, and we're done.
1345384	1346085	We're done for good.
1346525	1353569	So, as you would know, at 3.15, they call in the last group, and my name is the last one called on that group.
1354069	1355730	So, it's like, fuck.
1356071	1358592	I'm like, okay, settle, settle, settle, settle, no.
1359573	1359873	So...
1361863	1363003	I hope you get sequestered.
1364724	1365584	That would be funny.
1367125	1367945	It's not going to happen.
1369406	1370146	I don't think so.
1371787	1376869	What little I did find out about what's going on, it's not that big deal.
1377329	1381891	Well, I mean, to somebody it's a big deal, but, you know, it's not going to be on the news or anything.
1382051	1384011	We're not talking like a high-profile case.
1384051	1384652	It's just...
1385952	1388773	Well, yeah, you would have been able to tell as soon as you went in there.
1388833	1391813	I mean, they have a completely different type of process.
1391873	1392854	I don't know.
1393614	1395234	I just want to be out of there.
1395594	1398355	You know, it's not a matter of, like, I don't like jury duty.
1398475	1398815	It's fine.
1398915	1400455	I just really hate downtown SAC.
1400855	1401875	I hate driving down there.
1403116	1405696	Honestly, I hate everything about downtown SAC.
1406096	1409317	It is impossible to find any place to eat down by the jury place.
1409417	1413038	I walked around blocks just looking for, you know, a restaurant.
1413118	1413778	It just sucks.
1414338	1421083	and then, you know, in fact, I have to get there two hours early in order to get a parking space, you know, a free parking space.
1421244	1424566	Otherwise, I have to pay $6 a day, you know, for parking.
1425247	1425767	No, they don't.
1427889	1429670	Yeah, way to go, city of Sacramento.
1429710	1430511	You rock, you know.
1430831	1438077	Not only do you pay me only $15 to go to Jury Duty, but half that money is going to go to parking because you don't provide enough parking.
1439017	1439878	How fucking lame.
1440539	1443321	But, um... It'll all be over soon.
1444875	1446115	Hey, I got it good.
1446135	1454057	I mean, there were some people there, they were talking about like, some of the jurors that were there were talking about how they got to sit on another trial, and they were going to be picked on their own.
1454237	1461458	One of the, you know, they were asking if anyone has any hardships, you know, normally involving the trial, like it's going to take too long or something.
1461518	1463278	One of the trials was going to take three weeks.
1463838	1466079	I was like, oh, thank God I wasn't on that one.
1466279	1467239	Oh, that would have sucked.
1467939	1469279	Oh, no way.
1469299	1472000	I wouldn't have done it.
1472040	1474020	I'd be all, sorry, I'm on vacation next week.
1474847	1476848	No, I'd be like, my work's not gonna pay me.
1477568	1485030	You find out what the case is about, and then you make the most stupided statement that make them totally think that you'd be the wrong person to pick.
1485090	1493532	Like, say it's about a gay person being, you know, beaten up, that you say that you're a freaking anti-gay, you know?
1494172	1495112	It doesn't work that way.
1495413	1498834	It doesn't work that way because they tell you from the beginning what the case is gonna be about.
1499114	1500474	You pretty much can, it's just...
1502443	1504726	It's really the whole system is flawed the way they do it.
1504966	1508590	But I guess it works because they have so many trials a day.
1509572	1514337	But it doesn't make any sense because it's like, well, any idiot can find a way out of it.
1514738	1520124	It's just, I guess, on the honor system, which isn't worth much nowadays.
1520525	1520645	Yeah.
1521912	1526294	I don't know how, I guess I was just too young, because I think I got called in, like, on my 18th birthday.
1526354	1530036	I mean, I swear, it was like, as soon as I could go to jury duty, I was called.
1530876	1533717	And they were just like, I think they just thought I was too young, and they sent me home.
1534178	1535718	I was like, thank goodness, I don't want to be here.
1535738	1539280	Well, it's like there are people, like, they're all, what kind of...
1540095	1542356	I don't even know how they can have a hardship.
1542716	1547137	The trial's going to last like two days once they get the jury selected.
1547497	1550158	And you're like, oh, poor me, poor me.
1550418	1554620	I'm not going to have enough money to make rent because I missed two days of work.
1555120	1556560	Well, that's kind of how it is for some people.
1557080	1557460	Oh, well.
1558101	1562922	I mean, and you miss rent and it could script your life.
1563002	1565003	I mean, it's not just any laughing matter.
1565043	1566963	I think it's a bunch of bullshit the way I have it set up.
1568044	1568444	So anyway.
1568864	1569044	Yeah.
1571906	1576588	Rice Princess is suggesting if you wanted to get out of jury duty, you could have told them that you make sweet love to sheep.
1580230	1583012	That doesn't have anything to do with the trial, though.
1584152	1584853	So that wouldn't work.
1584873	1587854	Yeah, how would they ever find a juror in Chico if that's the case?
1588054	1588755	That's what I want to know.
1589775	1592897	Anyway, anything else you want to say about your day and your week?
1594958	1596539	No, I really didn't do much.
1596699	1600881	I just was, like, so preoccupied with this stupid jury crap that's, like,
1604692	1615040	I thought it was going to rain today, and I looked outside, but according to the weather, it's not going to rain for a while.
1615860	1618982	And, um, I don't know.
1619022	1620063	It's just supposed to get warmer.
1620083	1621464	It's supposed to be like the 90s.
1622285	1622325	Ew.
1623198	1628922	I don't know, I'm just pretty much just doing like running around and stuff today.
1628962	1633686	I went grocery shopping because I needed to do that and that's about it.
1633706	1637348	I was supposed to try to find a Halloween costume because I had to go to a party.
1637768	1638389	I don't know if I'm going to
1638889	1640230	You haven't figured out what you're dressing up as yet?
1640310	1645675	I had an idea, but there's just a problem is no one seems to have the costume that I want.
1645775	1646576	Um, I had a couple ideas.
1646656	1650359	First off was, um, the Mad Hatter, which is kind of cool.
1650899	1653342	Um, just do like an evil Mad Hatter type thing.
1654202	1656464	I could probably do that, and it's like, eh.
1656744	1660648	Then I could dress up like Neo from Matrix, because I already have a trench coat and glasses.
1661228	1664071	But really, it's the wrong kind of trench coat and stuff, and...
1664500	1665300	That would kind of suck.
1665320	1668341	Then my other one was the charred corpse of an astronaut.
1669221	1670021	You are horrible.
1670661	1674062	So I thought that would be kind of cool, because all you have to do is find an astronaut costume.
1674102	1676383	But you know, you'd be surprised that there's not that many out there.
1676403	1678523	I guess no one wants to dress up like an astronaut this year.
1679304	1683084	I hope you wouldn't be seen in public with that on, because you'd get beat up by somebody.
1684045	1685145	Oh, by the astronauts?
1685425	1687486	Wait, they can't, because they're charred corpses.
1688346	1689086	You're horrible.
1693357	1694658	I said you should have been a princess.
1695518	1696279	I didn't want to be a princess.
1696299	1698720	Because that would be ironic.
1699800	1702121	My co-worker is supposed to dress up like a dominatrix.
1702402	1703082	That's kind of cool.
1703742	1706324	Except she wouldn't be a good dominatrix.
1707144	1709185	Now our other co-worker is the slut.
1709225	1710386	She'd be a good dominatrix.
1712867	1713347	But that's all.
1714247	1714648	Okay.
1714708	1715688	Don't give me the microphone.
1716449	1717189	After comments like that.
1719253	1720833	I'll talk about my day and my week.
1720873	1725054	But first, I have to address the chat room because they're talking about me in there.
1726935	1727615	It's not funny.
1727675	1728595	Yes, it is funny.
1728795	1729375	No, it's not.
1729395	1729855	Yes, it is.
1729895	1734696	Because I look like absolute shit today and I don't even know why I'm sitting on the cam.
1734736	1738557	I should take the opportunity to sit in Jamie's hidden blue chair while she's not here.
1738997	1740197	But for whatever reason, I'm lazy.
1740237	1741437	I don't feel like getting up off the couch.
1741817	1745638	And I look really ugly today because I haven't really taken a shower.
1746218	1746498	Shut up.
1746958	1749221	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1765301	1767102	I don't even want to dignify that with a comment.
1767122	1767702	Did you read it?
1767982	1768543	Yes, I did.
1768663	1769163	It's funny.
1769263	1770144	I can read the chat rooms.
1770164	1773526	Well, everybody in the chat room is listening to the radio show, so they already pretty much know.
1773946	1779350	Some people in the chat room, well, not everybody who listens to the show gets in a chat room either, which just makes me sad.
1779550	1783192	Okay, for those not in the chat room, never mind.
1783773	1784293	That's right.
1784533	1786455	It's really too disgusting to say on air anyway.
1786575	1787335	That's a good bread.
1788676	1789396	I'm dissing you.
1789416	1791298	You're not supposed to say that's good.
1792981	1794802	I don't want to talk about it.
1794822	1795282	Joke's on you.
1795302	1796022	I don't want to go there.
1797002	1801704	Neither do I. The rest of my week was really pretty boring.
1802184	1807565	Tuesday and Wednesday was DDR Extreme most of the afternoon because we finally picked it up on Tuesday.
1808786	1810086	But we'll get into that later.
1810106	1811786	We'll talk about DDR Extreme later.
1811806	1813427	Yeah, I was so bored on Thursday.
1813467	1815207	I played that damn game all day.
1815747	1816388	And you know what?
1816428	1818808	That's the only time I'll ever play that damn game.
1818888	1820829	So it was nice while it lasted.
1822336	1823797	Extreme is disappointing.
1824477	1825237	Very disappointing.
1826018	1826598	We'll get to that later.
1827138	1827558	Oh, we are?
1827798	1831720	Yeah, well, we need topics to fill three hours, so let's not blow our load all at once here, please.
1833981	1834661	You're a dick.
1835282	1843045	Anyway, and then Thursday I started feeling sick, so I didn't really want to do shit after that, because Thursday I had to go run errands out in Roseville.
1843385	1844966	I didn't even bother to go by Golfland.
1846306	1847587	And then, God, what the hell...
1849156	1854238	I was supposed to go out Thursday night and I didn't because I was feeling sick.
1855319	1856559	You know what, I did go out last night though.
1856579	1862662	I went out dancing last night and it was kind of interesting because I was hearing all these new Bomani songs that they were playing.
1863022	1867784	Like the DJ at the club last night, oh no, Friday night, I meant Friday night, not last night.
1868845	1869325	My bad.
1870185	1882501	Friday night I went out and the DJ there was really really horrible like he was mixing songs together like not how you know most DJs mix songs together how they transition one song into another oh like I do
1883973	1885434	Yeah, but no, it was different, no.
1885474	1886535	He put Gravity in the background.
1886555	1889197	He didn't put Thought, yeah, no, he wasn't mixing Gravity into it either.
1889797	1891718	He put Thought, he didn't put any Thought into it.
1891778	1893959	He would just mix two records together on top of each other.
1894500	1895200	Oh, like I do.
1895640	1895961	Anyway.
1897161	1901744	But, like, no, what's funny is that I'm thinking about all these, like, new Bomani songs he was playing.
1901784	1905366	He was playing a song that's going to be in DDR Xbox, that Shiny Disco Ball song.
1905386	1905666	Oh, God.
1905706	1907127	Which I know we talked about a couple weeks ago on here.
1907608	1909229	And then he was playing Sandstorm, too.
1910109	1912512	And he was like mixing these two songs together.
1912672	1914013	It really, really sucked.
1914053	1918217	Like it was... Late Night, Disco Balls.
1918377	1920019	Shiny, Disco Balls.
1920159	1921740	Late Night, Booty Calls.
1921841	1922481	It was really awful.
1922501	1929248	People like that are getting jumped.
1929428	1930729	He was obviously new.
1930989	1932491	Loki, you should be a DJ.
1932511	1934453	You could be a DJ at a gay bar so easy.
1936638	1938199	Hey, what do you mean by that?
1938520	1942063	I just mean, you know, because you like gay music, it's alright.
1942083	1942584	Hey!
1944886	1945586	I'm just kidding.
1945907	1947168	My music is pure hetero.
1947188	1949410	You're the only straight guy I know with a Madonna vinyl.
1949550	1951051	It's not a professional DJ already.
1952152	1953233	I have more than one.
1953253	1955235	I have like three or four of them.
1955255	1956716	You're just making my point.
1957117	1962161	It's the My Girl Likes to Party All the Time record that really scares me.
1965290	1966171	He says he's guilty there.
1966211	1966871	Yeah, but that's not gay.
1967171	1967832	That's stupid.
1967852	1969112	That is so gay.
1969212	1969973	That's stupid.
1970793	1971394	Exactly.
1972654	1975216	And you're gay, and you're stupid, so it works.
1977597	1980879	Yes, DarkTetsuya in the chatroom says, shiny sandstorm balls.
1980919	1981359	That was it.
1982640	1983641	Shiny sandstorm balls.
1983661	1984321	Is that about something?
1984341	1985542	Shiny sandstorm balls.
1986152	1989515	God, what other... I was hearing a ton of, like, new Bomani songs at the club.
1989555	1991957	Like, I heard Love at First Sight, Stomp to My Beat.
1991977	1995340	You know, all these ones that you hear in... Well, they're not really Bomani songs.
1995380	2000064	They're not, but, you know, it's still neat to sit there and go, Oh my God, that's in DDR.
2000304	2000745	I don't know.
2000765	2002726	It's not quite what it used to be.
2002746	2005088	When he plays Max Period, I'll be like, Okay.
2005589	2006169	Yeah, you're right.
2006389	2008992	You're never going to hear a Konami original there, but... I wish.
2009472	2012254	I would love to hear Ecstasy at the dance club.
2013021	2013601	That's one thing.
2013681	2019345	But I remember, like, when I was first getting into DDR, back when, like, DDR USA was the only game there was to play, right?
2019885	2023007	Well, you know, around here, USA was the only game there was to play.
2024368	2029771	I remember going out to the club with a couple of Bomani friends, and we heard Stomp to my beat, and it was like, yeah!
2030291	2033593	Am I the only person who heard Stomp to my beat before it came out on DDR?
2033633	2036074	No, I had heard it before, too, but it got better.
2036355	2038696	You used to listen to it all the time when we played Cusar.
2042506	2045789	Yeah, I mean, they used to play it on Power 105.5 here all the time.
2047390	2050913	Which is just a local thing to say, but... That's right.
2050933	2054296	There was a radio station that used to play dance music, and it was big before DDR was around.
2054776	2056878	And too bad the damn station isn't around anymore.
2056898	2058239	It was the best station this town ever had.
2058299	2059840	Now it's Power 105.5 The Fish.
2060040	2061882	No, it's No Power 105.5 The Fish.
2063303	2064004	It's possible, I mean, because...
2080563	2082084	They are... That's the kind of stuff they would play.
2082124	2084185	A European... Anyway.
2084666	2085766	Hi, I'm off on a tangent.
2085786	2086287	Let me come back now.
2086307	2087087	What are you saying?
2087127	2087407	Yes.
2087647	2088268	Stomp to my beat.
2088348	2091970	And when we go to the club, and now it's in DDR.
2092010	2093431	So now we already like stomp to my beat.
2093491	2094191	Now it's in DDR.
2094411	2096852	And we'd be at the club and we would actually do the dance.
2096892	2099914	Well, like we do it where we go step, step, step, step, step.
2100495	2101895	Like, just like it was in stomp to my beat.
2102536	2104437	Like, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.
2104517	2106218	Left, left, left, down.
2106278	2106518	Anyway.
2107372	2108052	I'll shut up now.
2108353	2108913	I'm leaving.
2109153	2109493	No!
2109613	2110174	You scare me.
2110274	2110574	No!
2112415	2112775	Alright.
2113176	2115777	So you did, uh, Riverdance, basically.
2115797	2120480	RicePrincess says that the first time she heard Stomp To My Beat was when she went to go watch Strippers.
2121541	2123302	I don't know if that's the first, but she heard it.
2123322	2126604	That's kind of weird, though, to have them play that in a strip club.
2126884	2127284	Hey.
2127945	2129666	Stomp To My Beat, stomp on my face.
2131024	2131785	I mean, I don't get it.
2133126	2133787	Sit on my face.
2133807	2134728	She was sitting on my face.
2135929	2137210	Okay, that was really bad.
2137230	2137690	Stomp on my cock.
2140693	2142475	Stomp on my cock, Loki says.
2143215	2143936	No, thank you.
2148400	2149101	I guess I'm done.
2151846	2152546	I think that's it.
2152906	2153227	Yeah.
2153887	2154007	Oh!
2154587	2156908	Oh, Jamie's reminded me of another time we heard Stomp to My Beat.
2157248	2163730	It was when, um, you remember when we, like, all the Sacramento people used to go to Roseville Golf Land every, like, Thursday night or Wednesday night?
2163750	2164391	It was one of the two nights.
2164511	2165831	We used to go every Wednesday, Thursday night.
2165871	2168312	One time we were at Brookfield's and we heard Stomp to My Beat in the kitchen.
2169812	2171473	Oh my god.
2171513	2173294	We had an oh my gods, it's DDR moment.
2173854	2174754	Alright, I'll shut up now.
2176655	2177055	Brad!
2178215	2178836	How was your day?
2178876	2179416	How was your week?
2184474	2185135	That's pretty much it.
2185995	2188678	No, uh, fuck, nothing really.
2188738	2190819	I just, I've been playing PSO.
2190839	2191400	I don't know why.
2191440	2193121	I just have this urge to play PSO again.
2194523	2196264	And not online because I'm playing on Dreamcast.
2196324	2199006	And that would be Phantasy Star Online for the uninitiated.
2199307	2201869	If anybody doesn't know what PSO is, there's something wrong.
2202750	2204191	That's like saying, what's Auro?
2205032	2205732	What the fuck?
2206032	2206753	What's EQ?
2208174	2210736	What's... L-O-Z.
2211994	2214316	GQ, that's that magazine for men, right?
2234761	2236823	I'm a little late, but hey, they're good.
2238044	2239305	You have a weak mind.
2239365	2240946	You've been sucked into the Harry Potter.
2240966	2243088	They're actually very good books.
2243108	2244469	No, I know.
2245770	2249032	I remember when the first book came out, and hardly anybody knew about the book.
2249993	2254717	Only my friend's little brother was reading it, and it started to get bigger and bigger, and I was like, what is this thing?
2255317	2262123	Then he had this Harry Potter birthday party, where all of his friends, they decorated the house like a Hogwarts house,
2262953	2266314	If you know what that is, I'm pretty sure most people know because it's in the movie.
2266614	2269315	Anyway, and I was just like, what is this?
2269335	2270056	This is so stupid.
2270076	2276558	And by the time I know it, everybody's reading it, and I'm still skeptic about it, and the fourth book is out, and I'm just like, whatever.
2277038	2279059	And then Jamie, thank you Jamie, she buys...
2280043	2293606	Irene and I, the box set of the four books, the fifth book hasn't come out yet, and we had watched the first movie, and I really liked it, so, you know, we watched the second movie, I really liked it, and I finally got around to reading the books, and the books are so not kids' books.
2294306	2299847	They're geared towards kids, but I think there's a lot of things in the books that aren't, like, kids wouldn't even understand.
2300147	2303368	It's really, some of it's pretty complicated, so, good stuff.
2305309	2307049	No, there's no hardcore sex, Loki.
2307069	2307189	Okay.
2308942	2309703	Well, actually, I don't know.
2309743	2311704	I haven't gotten all the way through the fourth book yet.
2311724	2313606	You're thinking of Harry Cooter, not Harry Potter.
2313726	2314427	Harry Cooter.
2316768	2319751	Yeah, I haven't gotten all the way through the fourth or fifth book, so I don't know.
2319891	2325996	I can't say, but I'm sure there's a lot of people out there listening right now who have even read them all, so... Whatever.
2326136	2326857	No spoilers for me.
2327777	2333122	I'll just wait until the movie comes out and you can see Harry Potter having sex with Hermione while Ron sticks him up the ass.
2335632	2336032	I don't know.
2336512	2337173	With his wand.
2337253	2338654	You could probably download... Stick to his wand.
2338974	2341735	You could probably download that fanfic somewhere online.
2341755	2342115	Yeah.
2343656	2345397	Let's ask... Jamie might know where it is.
2346077	2346778	Jamie knows where it is.
2346798	2347918	You're going to get beat for that one.
2349039	2349379	Alright.
2349539	2356043	Okay, I have searched for pictures for the new movie coming out, the third movie, on Harry Potter.
2356463	2358044	And what comes up on Google Images?
2359784	2360965	Harry Potter doujinshis.
2361806	2364167	Which are like pornographic mangas.
2369180	2375482	I don't even know why people bother.
2375502	2380303	Let's see what Mario and Luigi look like when they're having anal sex.
2381584	2382684	Is that all you have to say, Brad?
2383144	2383764	Yeah, pretty much.
2383824	2385105	Alright, then let's ask Bradley.
2385485	2385905	How was your day?
2385925	2386345	How was your week?
2386785	2387606	Hey, how's it going?
2388426	2388986	Oh, that Bradley.
2390484	2395787	Monday through Wednesday, I actually did some work for one place.
2396047	2401170	Basically, I had a big stack of papers.
2401250	2409955	One was in order and one was not, so I had to take one stack and reorder it to get it ready to put with the other papers so that we could stuff it in envelopes.
2409975	2411476	So you got paid to shuffle papers?
2411937	2414018	Yeah, shuffle papers and throw them in envelopes.
2415074	2415274	and so on.
2434349	2437031	My cable got cut off because I haven't paid them yet for a while.
2437491	2439973	So I'm going to die low for a while, which sucks.
2440734	2441574	Sucks majorly.
2442035	2447819	Especially if you need to have people calling sometime for maybe interviews or something.
2447939	2452962	So I have to keep it off during the day when I have to take everything.
2453002	2454564	So that's kind of a bitch.
2458787	2460508	Saturday went around shopping and such.
2462694	2463994	and the limited money I have.
2464014	2465775	What'd you buy?
2465795	2467415	Just some detergent.
2470096	2471556	Day-to-day necessities.
2471916	2474937	I know, because everybody out there listening to the show wants to know what kind of detergent you use.
2475057	2476497	I want to know what kind of detergent you use.
2477037	2478137	I bought Cascade.
2478398	2478878	Cascade?
2479298	2479818	Wait, wait, wait.
2479878	2480798	For dishwasher detergent?
2480818	2481538	Yeah, yeah.
2481638	2487240	I have a... This will help everybody out there who has an apartment or house and actually has to do dishes.
2487920	2489320	Do not buy
2489875	2493937	Any name brand detergent for your fucking dishwasher.
2494637	2503620	I found out that Walmart brand Sam's Choice detergent from Walmart is better and cheaper than any other detergents out there.
2503640	2506501	And I've used pretty much every freaking kind of dishwasher detergent.
2507221	2509382	I used to use Electrosol, Cascade.
2509742	2510863	It would not clean anything.
2510923	2515004	Even if I cleaned the dishes before I cleaned the dishes, it still did not clean them.
2515304	2517505	But the Walmart, the Sam's Choice detergent
2518058	2518919	Fucking kick ass.
2519299	2519819	It's cheap, too.
2520320	2521741	Wait, there's two hands grabbing for the mic.
2522982	2526645	This is the most uninteresting topic ever, but I'm actually interested here.
2526805	2532629	So, you just know this based upon experience, or do you have the scientific data to back it up?
2533090	2533170	Okay.
2533190	2533290	Okay.
2533866	2540651	I found the idea from, they did a news report on why can't they basically get, this is how boring our local news stations are.
2541192	2547637	We can't figure out, they do this will it work Wednesdays thing or whatever and they try to see like which, they compare products to see if they really work well.
2547937	2551020	And they were saying, you know, here's the expensive brands and they did like tests.
2551562	2559507	And now, I don't know if they made the fake tests or not, you know, but basically they said their opinion was to use this specific brand, this Walmart Sam's Choice brand.
2559888	2562469	And I mean, I don't know if they're faking the test or not, but I said, I'll give it a shot.
2562729	2567833	And I have had nothing but bad results with other, I always thought it was my dishwasher that couldn't fucking wash the dishes.
2568353	2573136	But no, I go, I buy the Sam's Choice stuff, and it works better than any other kind of detergent I've ever used.
2573757	2576218	Probably because it has toxic substances in it, but who knows?
2576479	2576839	Who cares?
2578146	2579507	Yeah, good luck killing the Earth.
2579827	2582788	Your dishes come out with a nice glow to them.
2586829	2588230	Thanks for killing the Earth, Brad.
2588330	2595353	I know, it's all... I'm single-handedly destroying this planet, and I feel good about it.
2596373	2599154	Because I can eat off a clean plate, so fuck you.
2600295	2601875	Even if my turkeys grow three eyes.
2603696	2605417	Wait, turkeys, what are... I don't know, here.
2607068	2610191	If turkeys are growing extra limbs, that just means more food for me.
2611051	2612052	There's nothing wrong with that.
2613734	2615895	Supposedly, that's how KFC makes their chickens.
2617837	2623141	They have, like, no feathers, no beaks, huge bodies and tiny little legs.
2623382	2628066	KFC's doing something fucked up, because we all ate there the other day, and I swear to God, we were all like this afterwards.
2628086	2632629	We were all, like, clutching our stomachs, like, uh, chemical poisoning.
2634085	2634906	Thanks for watching!
2652159	2652840	A factor for that.
2653180	2656282	But, um, no, I think I was sick because I was, like, starving.
2656302	2662365	I hadn't eaten anything all day except for popcorn, a full thing of popcorn, and then I had a bunch of chicken.
2662746	2671511	And then later on that night, I had a, um, really hard, um, parmesan twist from Roundtable that were sitting out on the counter for three days.
2672171	2677174	And then after that, I'm all clenching my chest going, why am I not feeling good?
2678115	2678295	So...
2679881	2684182	Lesson for life, kids, don't start off the day with eating a bucket of popcorn.
2684402	2685923	It's never a good way to start.
2688103	2688284	Yeah.
2690624	2692325	Were you done talking about your day and your week, Bradley?
2694145	2696646	Yeah, I didn't do all that much other than that.
2697106	2700287	Other than Wednesday coming over here and playing some DDR Extreme.
2700987	2703448	That's right.
2704248	2706089	I forgot to add one thing.
2706509	2706629	Hmm?
2708282	2714946	I forgot to add one thing about my week and my day, and that is that on yesterday morning, I went and saw Kill Bill for the third time.
2715066	2715446	Thank you.
2716347	2717107	Because, shut up!
2717167	2718608	You were with me!
2719689	2720189	Screw you!
2721309	2724691	I know we missed the Pyramid tryouts because we had to go see Kill Bill again, so what can you do?
2726032	2730274	But Kill Bill was just as good the third time, and I will be going to see it at least a fourth time, if not fifth and sixth.
2730975	2731915	Because I'm sick.
2732856	2736758	So, anyway, before we get to the break, I got over the chat room
2737782	2738763	A message from Jamie.
2739083	2741224	She would like to share how her week and her day was.
2741744	2742845	So Jamie, how was your day?
2742905	2743645	How was your week?
2744546	2747547	Well, Jamie says, my week equals work.
2748348	2749849	My day equals suck.
2750789	2753330	And no Bomani, because I'm being frugal.
2756192	2756632	There you go.
2759754	2760014	All right.
2761237	2763419	If no one else has anything to say for right now, we're going to take a quick break.
2763920	2767703	And we're going to come back and we're going to talk about DDR Extreme because we all got to play it this week.
2767763	2769625	And we certainly have a lot to say about it.
2769705	2771666	So we'll get to that when we come back.
2772547	2773928	In the meantime, enjoy this break.
2774008	2779673	We'll have some Casey and the Sunshine Band from X2USA all the way to Sean the Horny Master.
2780073	2780514	We'll be back.
3088755	3097321	Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
3097421	3103185	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
3103805	3104926	Howdy, folks.
3105026	3105447	We're back.
3105487	3107848	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 65.
3108309	3112571	The sick episode, because Jamie's out sick tonight.
3114093	3115574	She would have tried to really...
3116932	3118513	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3146707	3148587	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3174389	3176230	Oh, you're looking through the peephole, Loki, huh?
3177250	3177710	What do you see?
3178410	3179431	Are there naked people out there?
3182431	3182872	Oh, just Brad.
3183252	3183992	Damn my phone!
3187173	3188133	Oh, is Brad talking to the neighbors?
3188973	3197116	Yeah, we have some interesting neighbors, because our neighbors upstairs to the left, they're big anime fans, so they think what we do is pretty funny.
3197556	3200917	They like to make fun of Loki and his DDR pads that he's building outside.
3203577	3204137	What did they say?
3205258	3212121	I was commenting to them the other day about how Loki's building his machine, and I commented something like, oh yeah, they asked me, where are you going to put it?
3212502	3217644	And I said, oh well, Loki's going to get rid of the TV and kind of put it in its place, because the cabinet's going to be a television too.
3218625	3222967	And they were kind of like, oh, there's nothing like watching Loki playing some DDR.
3225069	3226870	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3251465	3252326	Fuck, I missed something.
3252446	3255588	They're talking in the chatroom about your neighbors are on drugs.
3257570	3259071	Well, because I just talked to your neighbors out there.
3259291	3259551	Okay.
3259831	3260392	I'll tell you later.
3260672	3261292	I'll talk about it later.
3261372	3261632	Anyway.
3263014	3263454	Extreme.
3263954	3265555	Sucks.
3267177	3268317	I didn't really care for Extreme.
3268337	3271440	The last machine I was really ever excited about was Max 2.
3272961	3279926	Extreme came out in the arcade and I thought it was really cool they put Sakura in there and Zenon and Daikin Kai and
3281097	3286480	Miracle Moon, LED Style, like, those were a few good songs, but the most of the songs in the machine sucked.
3287061	3298147	Okay, now, the home version comes out, and I hear, you know, the songs that are gonna be out on it, the unlocks, I heard them pretty much before, like, I got to, yeah, I heard them before I got to play the game.
3298608	3301870	I got to play the game, the steps on all of them pretty much suck.
3302030	3305572	Some people will disagree with me, saying, like, Scorching Moon steps are cool, I think...
3306448	3310932	I don't know, I think they're being really non-innovative with their steps still, and I mean, there's only so much you can do.
3312613	3318718	There's only so much you can do, but still, like, they gave them all easy difficulties except for Max period, but we can talk about that later.
3319459	3322321	Hasn't Konami kind of been doing that with all the new songs lately?
3322341	3325684	I mean, people were bitching about Max 2 USA kind of had shitty steps too.
3326485	3328808	Well, that's because those steps are made in Hawaii, I believe.
3328848	3330269	Konami Hawaii makes those steps.
3330730	3331551	This is from what I understand.
3331591	3333874	Konami Hawaii does everything about the Xbox.
3333894	3335375	This is just how I understand it.
3335415	3336036	I could be wrong.
3336377	3341122	From what I picked up, Konami Hawaii only does everything relating to the Xbox game, and I mean everything.
3341262	3344386	Konami Hawaii has completely developed the Xbox and computer versions of DDR.
3346297	3350599	There's kind of a debate whether Konami USA is making those steps or Konami Japan.
3351359	3354001	Some people think it's being done in the U.S., some people say it's Japan.
3354161	3355001	I guess people don't really know.
3355021	3355942	There's a different style.
3356002	3362585	There's obviously a different style to the steps on the American-only songs that don't show up in other Japanese games, you know.
3363025	3366887	I can tell there's some sort of difference to them, so I'm thinking they're done by somebody else.
3367647	3371569	But still, the thing is... What was I going to say?
3373004	3375565	Sorry, I'm getting sidetracked by some of the stuff that's being talked about.
3375706	3376566	Then don't look at the chatroom.
3376586	3377286	Look at it when you're done talking.
3377306	3379788	There's important stuff I want to talk about that they keep talking about.
3379808	3380208	Oh, alright.
3380888	3381909	Anyway, I'll get back to that later.
3382329	3385231	Okay, um... Shoot.
3385551	3388573	Anyway, yeah, the steps for these new Unlocked songs were kind of ass.
3390174	3392215	I love Scorching Moon.
3392675	3398618	I mean, I pretty much like all of the Unlocked songs on Xtreme except for Max Period, which, what, leaves three songs?
3399178	3401220	Undo Toi, Scorching Moon, and Stupid Barber.
3401240	3401620	Pretty much.
3402140	3408405	Those were all good songs, and it was pretty much up to how the steps felt, and the steps didn't feel right.
3408845	3411147	Max Period was an extreme disappointment.
3411487	3416471	In my opinion, it seems like they hired Bomani Ruler to make a step file for Max Period.
3417752	3418333	And they didn't.
3418413	3419413	Don't start that rumor.
3419634	3420234	I know, I know.
3420254	3421515	That rumor's already going around.
3421535	3426899	I know, but you look at it, and it's just like, okay, let's speed up the fucking BPM to 800 BPM or whatever it is at the very end.
3427359	3427780	Wow.
3427800	3427860	Wow.
3428803	3429543	That's fun.
3430444	3431905	I think they've totally jumped the shark.
3432245	3433866	No, here's what they did.
3434906	3436627	They don't really know what we want.
3437528	3440269	That's why DDR Extreme was, what songs do you want?
3440369	3444371	Notice all the songs that they picked, a lot of them, were sim files beforehand.
3444891	3445832	So, think about it.
3446672	3449614	If I'm going to find out what people want as a sim file...
3450274	3454637	or not a sim file, but a steps for Max and what I want the song.
3454957	3458039	I'm going to go listen to all the sim files and mix songs.
3458379	3461440	Notice... Wait, wait, you're talking about Max 2 USA, not Extreme, right?
3461460	3466083	Because you're talking about like Heaven had like 50 sim files for it and then... No, no, no, no, no.
3466143	3467284	I'm talking about Extreme.
3467604	3468685	We're talking Extreme here.
3469065	3469405	Okay.
3469425	3470506	Okay, because look.
3470906	3473807	Colors, A, V, those all have steps.
3473868	3475388	I see what you're talking about.
3475528	3475769	Okay.
3475789	3477309	Now look at Max period.
3477730	3478530	It's basically...
3480291	3483115	I could basically make that stupid song, okay?
3483215	3484276	That song... It was very basic.
3484296	3486378	It wasn't remixed at all, very much.
3486919	3490102	And, um... Why do you need Komi in an original song?
3490163	3493266	Okay, and the step charts to it, it's a bunch of jumping.
3493446	3493847	It's just...
3494582	3495703	It was fucking retarded.
3496223	3499626	So, how are most of the Max step charts and songs?
3499746	3500426	They suck.
3500746	3504529	So, I guess they think that we like this kind of step charts, so that's what they gave us.
3504689	3506751	I really liked the steps for Max 300.
3506791	3508632	I think those were really good for the song.
3508912	3510453	Max Unlimited, pretty good.
3510994	3512395	Lots of jumps, but still pretty good.
3512975	3514036	And then it just started going downhill.
3514416	3517338	Legend of the Max, alright, but just, I don't know.
3517358	3520540	I think it should have ended there, just with Max 300 and Max Unlimited.
3520621	3522222	And the steps just start, you know...
3523242	3526864	I guess there's just only so much they can do with the steps before they run out of ideas.
3528005	3530066	It's interesting that you guys keep saying there's only so much they can do.
3530106	3531006	There's only so much they can do.
3531026	3532627	There's only so much they can do because I think they're done.
3533528	3537630	Because DDR Extreme has a credits mode on it, and in this credits mode...
3538343	3540866	It's very epilogue-ish in the way it's presented.
3540926	3542608	It kind of goes through the history of DDR.
3542628	3545792	Like it shows DDR first mix was then, and DDR second mix was then.
3545832	3546793	It shows little screenshots and stuff.
3547273	3550057	And then they're pretty much giving you the impression that that's it.
3550257	3550637	We're done.
3550757	3551839	No more DDR.
3552620	3553801	Although I don't think that's the case.
3553841	3556003	I think DDR is going to come back, but it's going to be a...
3558143	3558924	It's going to be different.
3559004	3561565	It's going to be different, like how Beatmania 2DX is different than Beatmania.
3561585	3586682	And to further reinforce that, they have, in each mix that's released, there's a master song list that includes all the songs that they're working on for other mixes that have not been released yet, and DDR Extreme has the same track list as DDR Max USA 2, which pretty much, it's just, all that's left on that song list is just the Ultra Mix, and that's it.
3588363	3595391	But obviously we know the European, I mean they're still developing for Europeans market, you know, and they're also developing for our market.
3595531	3599815	So, I mean I'm sure you'll see more stuff, it's just we'll only be in the US.
3600436	3606522	And we'll see, I mean once the stupid party collection comes out, there might be some more stuff on there, you never know.
3608144	3608284	So.
3609022	3612505	Yeah, that's true, because there's still the Party Edition coming out.
3612565	3615307	Party Collection, and you never know, it might be like preview for something.
3615467	3622712	Although, I seem to think that it's kind of weird that Party Collection is kind of coming out after DDR has kind of already had its epilogue here.
3623532	3626675	So I don't know what DDR Party Collection is going to be.
3626735	3628996	I'm hoping that maybe there'll be some kind of hint for the new DDR.
3629016	3632819	I wouldn't read too much into that cred screen, because they're just talking about what came out so far.
3632879	3634120	It's kind of like a thank you to them.
3634140	3634220	I'm...
3635607	3636287	I don't know about you guys.
3636307	3646636	Did you guys see the credit sequence at all, or did you guys kind of, even from Max Period, even just the Max Period, thank you for playing the way it claps at the end and it's like a finale type thing, more of like an encore kind of song.
3648437	3650139	Then again, that song sucked.
3650479	3651860	Yeah, it did suck.
3652341	3653542	I'll give you that, but you know.
3655342	3661085	The whole thing is it comes back down to what they put on that stupid header for Extreme.
3661125	3662005	We're starting over.
3662905	3664986	You don't start over if you're going to end it right there.
3665306	3667347	I mean, that's kind of retarded right there.
3668288	3670649	I mean, obviously they're going to do something with it.
3670709	3672689	They didn't say, this is the last one.
3672789	3674990	This is, you know, it ends here.
3675150	3678552	You know, the final revolution or something like that, you know.
3679252	3681573	They would definitely advertise it like that if it was the last one.
3681613	3683774	I don't think they're just going to be like, eh, whatever.
3686161	3689225	I mean, there's still plenty of stuff that they haven't even tried yet.
3689265	3696993	They haven't tried, like, doing songs with unlocks that have to do with the emall cards and stuff like that, and I'm sure there's a new machine coming.
3697654	3701819	It's just a new type of machine that they're still developing that's probably a little ways away.
3703996	3707337	Here's what's going to be interesting.
3707417	3714860	I'm very confident that we're going to see DDR Extreme in the U.S., a home version of DDR Extreme.
3714900	3716261	I'm very confident that we're going to have that.
3717161	3718642	It's going to be interesting to see if the U.S.
3718682	3723243	kind of treats it as the last mix or what they're going to do, because as far as I can tell, DDR in the U.S.
3723323	3724904	is still mega popular.
3725184	3729206	I mean, I was listening to Under Station Live on Friday night, the radio show that
3730524	3732925	I started on that's still on Live365 if you want to catch it.
3733325	3750932	I was listening to Under Station Live, and the host there works for one of those discount stores, one of those big discount stores, and they're getting, like, huge shipment of dance pads in now, which shows, like, you know, well, maybe it's that, oh, the dance pads aren't selling, so they're having to be relegated to discount stores, but that more shows to me that DDR is, like, everywhere.
3750952	3752473	You know what I mean?
3753653	3756034	It's still growing in the U.S., from what I see.
3757526	3771694	Just like always, in Japanese games that are produced, directed, and created in Japan, we always get them, you know, whatever the latest thing is in Japan, we get them either a few months to a year or years behind them.
3771994	3778657	And, you know, it's just starting to get, I mean, even though there were American machines three years ago, with the 1.5, you know,
3780138	3797010	It didn't still take off nearly as much as it's going to start with, these home versions, because people who don't have the... A lot of people out there see it as, oh, this is a good way to get an exercise, but they don't want to go up and make a fool of themselves on the American machines out there in the arcades, or some of the import machines.
3797330	3799572	Now they're like, okay, I can buy it and play it in my own home.
3799632	3801513	So it's starting to get popular.
3801553	3802214	People are starting to...
3802914	3812023	See, and I think, yeah, there is still a life for DDR, you know, a market for DDR in America, but I don't see there being much more of a market for music games in general.
3812043	3815066	In the next two years, I think we're going to find out where music games are going.
3816287	3816968	Ending, or...
3817691	3844782	Whether or not it's going to go much longer Because a lot of other companies are doing Namco has a line of music games They've got Taiko no Tatsujin You know, there's a lot of other companies out there that are doing Enix has been doing the Bust a Move series Even though that's pretty much done with Music games are going to die out very soon So it's not surprising that the latest versions of DDR are kind of just sucking I think they're just going to start I think they're going to start...
3846332	3848393	You can tell by where their money's going with games.
3848433	3851495	The big, big titles that come on me are putting out like this New Castlevania.
3851736	3860481	Obviously, they're taking their money away from their Bomani series, and they're putting it towards something else that people are going to... might last longer.
3860521	3860821	I don't know.
3861061	3861742	That's just my opinion.
3863803	3865344	I think you're wrong on one thing.
3865364	3866964	I don't think the music games are dying.
3867024	3869284	I think they're changing.
3869885	3872705	As the systems get bigger and better, I think the music games are changing too.
3872765	3874906	I think that's why we have this new line of games coming out.
3874926	3876186	We have the karaoke revolution.
3876686	3882608	They say karaoke is going to be the next big music game because you've got American Idol, the game as well, which isn't really karaoke.
3882648	3883208	It's more crap.
3884469	3888795	The thing I was thinking of, though, is look at DDR itself as an arcade machine.
3889076	3891479	It's running on hardware that's a good 10 years old.
3892220	3892881	That's true.
3892941	3897888	It's running on... Well, not about 10 years old, but it's pretty damn old.
3898109	3898289	Yeah, 98.
3898389	3900192	It's like a good 6 years old right now.
3901378	3902599	It's due for an update.
3902679	3911726	I mean, it's so old right now, they can't do anything else with this, so they can't release another game on there because it will just be inferior.
3911987	3913147	They can't possibly do it.
3913448	3916850	That's why they're coming up with a new hardware system for it.
3917191	3925337	It would make sense that they're shifting their money away from it right now, and they're kind of hurrying through some of these things, because maybe they're just trying new stuff right now with the hardware.
3925637	3926098	They're trying to...
3927699	3933241	I would love to see, to make DDR more interactive, love to see them bring out another, like a substream type mix, but have it a little more interactive, where...
3948047	3970252	You've got a newer version of Beatmania 2DX and a newer version of, or just whatever Beatmania machine they want to link to it, I would hope it'd be 2DX, with a DDR, a newer version of that, and let's say, you know, you play, somebody's playing 2DX, you don't have to have them linked, but if you want to have them linked, one person on 2DX will be playing the song, like DJing, so you've got more interaction, you've got like a person who's DJing and a person who's dancing.
3970572	3975793	Then, depending on how good the person playing 2DX, DJing, quote unquote, is doing, you
3976388	3976988	DarkSakura, Loki,
3998414	4001376	It changes the way the steps turn out in the end of the song.
4001836	4005538	So like if you miss a certain step, it goes ahead and makes the song a little easier near the end.
4005578	4012002	Whereas if you start doing really good, and you keep doing better and better, and you're hitting all the steps, the song kind of morphs and it upgrades.
4012242	4014704	It becomes a harder song with a different type of ending.
4015336	4015956	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4042242	4043783	One arcade in the whole nation would have it.
4044464	4045505	That's arcade infinity.
4045525	4050970	Not if they put in the effort to produce many of them and really advertise it.
4051250	4053011	It would be so expensive.
4053672	4055013	It would be so expensive.
4055033	4061138	I don't think any... The interesting thing about DDR is as expensive as it is, you can still find it at your local bowling alley.
4061779	4065202	Well, okay, I'm not thinking in the interest of us Americans.
4066782	4075046	I'm thinking of in the Japanese market because I'm not going to be one of those people who sits there and complains, why don't we get these cool Japanese games in America?
4075126	4077927	Because they're not made for us in America.
4078027	4082869	The American companies will want to bring them over when they think we're ready for them or if there is a market.
4083189	4085570	They're made in Japan for the Japanese market.
4086977	4093281	Now, on top of that, I'm thinking, for their interest, they have a lot of DDR machines and a lot of 2DX machines in Japan.
4093701	4098905	They could just have a hardware upgrade, including, like, a network adapter that could link these machines.
4099505	4109552	I mean, making new machines, of course, would be hell of expensive, but for them to just do... I mean, the hardware upgrade from 8th style to 9th style 2DX was a pretty big upgrade.
4109772	4113795	I mean, it's all hard drive, it's all computer now, running an OS of, I believe, Windows XP.
4114631	4124317	So they obviously can do it, and they can keep it somehow money, economic, a good economic decision.
4124337	4125598	I think it can be done.
4127019	4127359	I don't know.
4127500	4141609	I just think that, like I believe, because I heard a few years ago the rumor was that Konami's been getting some bad flack, you know, or some bad results with their music series because of all the other companies bringing out other music games.
4142714	4158287	I mean, that's... If you have to admit, after Max 2 came out, I think all the rest of their music games have just been like... It may just be me, but nobody I know except the hardcore players are interested in Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania anymore.
4158667	4160069	Yet the mixes keep coming out.
4160089	4160969	Yeah, that's right.
4161290	4162751	And poppin' music keeps coming out.
4162771	4165013	Nobody cares about... Like, Guitar Freaks is just...
4165633	4171916	I love the game, but you have to look past the fact that it's been beaten into the ground.
4171936	4175658	Yeah, well, you make a point, because people are going to get pissed off and say, hey, I love Guitar Freaks Drum Mania.
4195174	4199577	Get past the fact that you love the game and the idea of the game and look at the quality of the music on it.
4200217	4205800	The quality of the music has gone down since, like, 5th Mix, Drum Mania, at least that I can think of, because that was the first machine we got.
4206480	4208121	No, actually, no, we got 5th Mix, Guitar Freak, sorry.
4209602	4213384	You know, there were a lot of songs on there that I would play constantly.
4213404	4221489	I pretty much always had something fresh to play, but when I go and I try to play Guitar Freak's 8th Mix, I think we have, there's probably, like, five songs I'll play.
4222910	4225732	I mean, there are some good old songs that came, but I think I played them to death.
4225812	4229735	And then as far as the new songs is concerned, it's just like there's not very many good new songs.
4229875	4234079	So the series has kind of been... I was just in Milpitas Golf Land not too long ago.
4234119	4236380	I was there for Chubb's birthday party a couple weeks ago.
4236941	4238362	And they have Guitar Freaks.
4238442	4239443	It's either 9 or 10.
4239503	4240183	I don't know what it was.
4240584	4247009	But I walked by it at one point, and it was completely empty, and I had no interest in putting the dollar in and playing, even though I'd never even played it yet.
4247589	4249851	Yeah, I haven't played it, so I think I'd try it out, but still...
4252600	4255623	I played the Guitar Freaks 10, I think, or 9.
4256384	4257145	It was, yeah, it was 9.
4257205	4258726	I don't even know if it's 9 or 10.
4258786	4260728	10 just came out, I think.
4260869	4261509	10's just coming out.
4261870	4262710	So it was Guitar Freaks 9.
4263171	4266635	I played that at Phantom of Khan once, and I was like, eh.
4267455	4268617	After that, didn't even care.
4269277	4272681	Played it like maybe one or two times, and I was done.
4273161	4273922	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4290507	4296650	Unlocked, you know, all three new songs, which was like, whoop-a-dee-doo, and then I was done.
4297350	4299491	I was done playing the game, I just didn't care no more.
4299791	4303073	Because, you know, I played the rest of these songs to death in the arcade.
4306154	4311777	I don't know, I will always like Drum Mania, because I personally, I love drum music.
4312281	4312762	www.darksakura.com
4324065	4327669	And even when we have Drum Mania, it's broken a lot, you know, constantly.
4328350	4330192	So, I can't speak for it.
4330212	4334196	If I go down to M. Milpitas and get to play their Drum Mania 8th mix, then maybe I'll like it.
4334236	4335578	I can't really speak for it right now.
4336579	4342606	I hate to put you on the spot, Bradley, but I'm curious, because I know you're a big fan of Guitar Freaks, because you're always asking me to play the music from it.
4343807	4345229	What do you think about this whole conversation?
4348101	4352145	Eh, well, I haven't played Ninth because I haven't been in the medias in like six months.
4354506	4355147	I still like it.
4355387	4363854	I actually haven't really heard the music from Ninth because I maybe listened to it once and haven't listened to it since.
4363914	4368298	So I can't really say anything about the quality, but I still enjoy it.
4369659	4370800	That's really all I can say at the moment.
4371961	4371981	I...
4373072	4379076	I have to say I am looking forward to Marmalade, Potpourri de Marmalade on, I think it's like Guitar Freaks 10.
4379957	4388602	Yeah, if they're not doing any more DDR, you would think all the artists that do the originals for DDR will now, you know, go to some other games and make some good originals for that.
4389403	4392104	I don't know, of course, I don't know what fucking game Soda could do.
4392465	4394886	Well, I guess he'll go to 2DX or something.
4395326	4398428	Although, you know, it's debatable if 2DX has as much life left as well.
4398448	4398508	So...
4401866	4402326	Who knows?
4403727	4405568	Who knows where all that's going?
4406508	4406768	Okay.
4406828	4409590	It's hard to make a prediction.
4409650	4410370	We'll just have to see.
4410510	4412231	Was there anything you saw in the chat room you want to comment on?
4412411	4414152	I know you saw some stuff earlier that made you go on.
4414172	4415092	It's a completely different topic.
4415132	4416453	It'd be kind of weird to change topics right now.
4416493	4416973	That's alright.
4417133	4418714	But I want to say something real quick.
4419554	4421095	In case your neighbors are listening now.
4422356	4422896	Are they really?
4424076	4429838	Well, your neighbors walked by and they were saying, so, do you still do the show?
4429898	4430558	And I said, yes.
4430678	4433339	And they asked, what is it called and how do they get to it?
4433439	4439440	And so I basically said, live 365, search for Orange Lounge and check it out because the page isn't updated really yet.
4439660	4440860	It needs to be updated, the web page.
4441861	4444101	Yeah, it does need an update.
4444241	4444942	He's funny, though.
4445102	4447882	Your neighbor said he could listen to it.
4447902	4449243	He's got broadband, so he could listen to it.
4449323	4450363	And then he could, like, I don't know,
4451855	4456379	respond to something you say in the chat room and then come running downstairs, knock on your door and go, hey, did you get that?
4456939	4457299	Yeah.
4457600	4464125	He could, theoretically with the buffer, one of them could run downstairs, yell something in the microphone, then run upstairs and hear themselves.
4464145	4465245	Oh, exactly, exactly.
4465285	4466887	With the buffer, they could hear themselves say it.
4468168	4470690	Because I think we've, I've done that in one way or another.
4470710	4474493	I don't remember what it was, but I remember like yelling something in it and then going off to hear it somewhere else.
4474513	4477735	I think it was when we were doing a remote broadcast for one of the tournaments or something.
4477935	4478836	That's great.
4480122	4481604	Well, come say hello if you're listening.
4481644	4482726	Yeah, if neighbors are listening.
4482746	4483126	Hi, neighbors.
4483147	4484008	Sorry, I forget your name.
4484028	4484949	That's my test.
4485050	4486532	I want to see if they're listening.
4487013	4488455	Come downstairs and say something to me on the show.
4488475	4490078	I'm afraid they would have turned it off a long time ago.
4490658	4491600	They probably got bored.
4491620	4492341	This is so boring.
4492361	4493944	The Guitar Freaks chat probably put them to sleep.
4494548	4500232	Alright, well let's wake everybody up with some... Oh no, you wanted to respond to some comments in the chatroom, you wanted to take a topic shift.
4500732	4506997	Why don't we go to break, and then we'll come back and you can do the other topic, and then we'll do the cage match, because we need to get to tonight's cage match as well.
4507297	4507857	Okay, we'll do that.
4508898	4515183	We are... Oh, you see that in the chatroom right now?
4515203	4517064	Oh!
4517104	4517164	Oh!
4520885	4521825	Oh, hey, hello!
4522486	4525306	There you go.
4527627	4529808	I was wondering who the new people in the chat room were.
4529828	4531648	There you go, you never know who the new people are.
4532208	4534809	Okay, we'll be back after this break.
4534869	4542912	We're going to play Jamie's, she's out tonight because she's sick, but she wanted to hear some Liar Liar from Guitar Freaks 4th, all that talk about Guitar Freaks.
4542932	4543392	So here it is.
4543812	4544052	Enjoy.
4570615	4571656	and the rest of the band.
4603417	4604959	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4650763	4651767	We have got the bomb!
4685087	4685991	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4810820	4811506	Thanks for watching!
4842117	4843337	Orange Lounge Radio.
4843697	4845838	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
4852399	4854920	Hello, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
4854960	4855300	You know what?
4855700	4859781	That's funny, because during the break, the neighbors came downstairs, so they were listening.
4860741	4861301	What do you know?
4862081	4866122	So, we have to refrain from talking about how much Folsom sucks right now.
4866142	4868983	Yeah, let's keep the language down to a minimum.
4870717	4871217	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4893968	4904816	I'm not going to be talking about condoning any kind of illegal activity, except I'm just going to say there's some skepticism about mod chips for next generation systems.
4904856	4910480	I'm speaking specifically of Sucksbox, Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube.
4911060	4913982	I don't know anything about Xbox.
4914383	4915143	I don't care to.
4915363	4916224	I don't like Xbox.
4916284	4917105	I'm not going to talk on that.
4917785	4920586	GameCube, there's no current way to copy games.
4920646	4923927	So there is no reason... Although Matt thinks he heard something today.
4923947	4924807	Matt, what's that, Matt?
4925467	4926107	I read something today.
4926127	4931629	I downloaded this off of supernova.org, your wonderful BitTorrent site.
4932089	4935990	Anyways, it is... And let me pull this up real quick here.
4936730	4940991	Okay, it's a... I bought... It's a GameCube pack is what I got.
4941031	4942092	It's a bunch of different files.
4942992	4945273	One of the files on there is called...
4946813	4948615	PSUL 1.1 GameCube Code Uploader
4970317	4972960	Using your network adapter.
4973220	4985631	So basically the way it works is you have to have a copy of Phantasy Star Online, a broadband adapter, a PC to GameCube cable basically, just a network cable from your... A patch cable.
4987113	4988434	An Ethernet card, of course.
4988474	4992778	So basically you're just making a network connection from your GameCube to your PC.
4993298	4993819	And you just...
4994699	5006407	and you have to set up your computer on a certain IP so it can communicate with it and you set up your IP in your Phantasy Star Online thing and you basically
5007131	5009274	Make a connection with Phantasy Star Online
5026295	5026936	Very glitchy.
5027576	5031920	Games they've gotten to work on it are Luigi's Mansion works fine.
5033622	5034302	What was the other one?
5034342	5037145	I think it was Animal Crossing they can get to work also.
5037205	5044371	This just means we're this much closer to finally figuring out a way to back up, quote unquote, your games for GameCube.
5045287	5048451	Well, they actually have a program that supposedly does that, too.
5048772	5049753	It's not really been taped.
5049853	5061390	Well, I've heard, because, Mike, I have a cousin who's, you know, been renamed Nameless, or remained Nameless, if, anyway, who apparently is, like, he's on the top always with all the, um...
5062421	5065102	The backing up of games for all systems.
5065162	5069564	And he told me a couple months ago that apparently there was no way to do it yet for GameCube.
5069644	5072865	But, hey, in the next couple months they may have found something out.
5072965	5081129	It's just really funny because I love watching how companies come out and say their system is so secure.
5081389	5081949	It's foolproof.
5082309	5084690	And those are the companies that are the easiest to crack.
5084850	5088052	Well, Nintendo's never really had a really good way to block...
5088672	5089252	Piracy.
5089633	5092054	Supposedly, you know what's also weird?
5092314	5100679	Supposedly, I don't know if the GameCube is backwards compatible, but supposedly I read on one of the posts that Nintendo 64 ROM images work on there, too.
5101039	5101640	It's possible.
5101660	5102820	What are you talking about?
5102840	5105222	Nintendo's always had one of the best ways to block piracy.
5105262	5106242	They have cartridges.
5106622	5108624	You can't copy a cartridge very easily.
5108884	5110325	You can, but it's not easy.
5110605	5113606	It's not as easy as putting in a PlayStation disc, click, copy, done.
5113626	5114667	Okay, here's the thing, though.
5114707	5115528	and having a modded PSX.
5115608	5116448	It's similar.
5116749	5119291	It's easy in ways and not as easy in other ways.
5119951	5123034	For the N64, my cousin had this thing called the V-Doctor.
5123334	5125576	It was a pretty pricey drive.
5125596	5133782	It was a CD-ROM drive you stuck underneath the N64 and it hooked up to it through this little serial cable thing that was on the N64.
5134283	5135844	You hooked that into your hard drive.
5136619	5150807	And what you would do, or to your computer, or what you could, the reason why I had a CD-ROM drive is because you could either burn a CD full of ROM images from N64 games, and then put it in this little V-Doctor thing, this drive, and it would play the games on your N64.
5151067	5153429	You just had to have this other little cartridge, it was like a blank...
5154162	5156263	Ram cartridge that you would plug into your N64.
5156323	5162606	So, I mean, he had every freaking American and Japanese N64 game out.
5162806	5167148	And even stuff that hadn't come out yet, when I went over to his place, I was like, wow, how'd you do this?
5167408	5168569	I mean, he was doing it.
5168589	5169309	He was pirating it.
5169669	5174492	And even Super Nintendo, there were, you know, obviously there's ROM images and there's emulation.
5174572	5176132	It was funny.
5176172	5178153	Actually, I saw an auction for it.
5178173	5179394	It was an arcade game.
5180655	5186801	I don't know what game they would use this in, but it was an arcade memory card reader for a Nintendo 64.
5186881	5189063	It sold for, I believe, 99 cents.
5191025	5193507	NFL Blitz, I think, is the game that uses it.
5193547	5194668	Because Roseville Golf Line has one.
5194788	5196950	I've seen the Nintendo 64 memory card thing.
5196990	5198231	Nobody uses that on here.
5198251	5198812	Nobody uses it.
5200173	5205257	Anyhow, and my point was how it's easier in some ways is because you didn't have to mod any of the Nintendo systems.
5205577	5216686	Whereas, like with Sony's, you have to get inside, void your warranty, solder here, solder there with this little chip you buy, and then possibly mess up your system, which I have done once out of like the 30 PlayStation systems I've modded.
5217007	5221170	If I remember correctly, I think the Xbox, you don't actually have to... Supposedly, yeah.
5221190	5222251	There's a software mod, I think.
5222271	5223052	There's some software.
5224654	5228956	Which is not surprising, because you look at all the flaws in Microsoft software, so hey.
5229716	5231917	Okay, well you want to get back to the original topic.
5231937	5236739	You want to talk about next-gen modding, which you have advised me against in the past.
5236959	5238099	In the past, in the past.
5238279	5245102	And I've always said, every time I brought this up in the past, like when PS2 first came out, because this is the current subject now, PS2.
5246122	5250884	In the past I said, it's not worth your time to buy a mod chip for PS2.
5250964	5253025	And when I said in the past, I mean like when it came out.
5253689	5266881	because they would come out with new games that would have mod detection, that would have, you know, mod chip detection, that would basically lock out the game so you couldn't play it, or specifically, mostly that's going on for a lot of the online titles, which there isn't really many for PS2 anyway.
5267041	5267882	Not right now.
5269524	5272106	You know, there were ways... Final Fantasy XI, just around the corner.
5272126	5272506	Exactly.
5272687	5275869	There was, you know, ways that they could combat it.
5276350	5279393	My cousin bought, a year ago, a mod chip for his PS2.
5280385	5284687	and it's not as like, you know, new-y, fan-dangled and, you know, great as the newer ones out.
5285007	5287088	But it has not given him a problem since.
5287148	5291370	He's been able to back up every game that's come out since and play it fine.
5292770	5293791	That's a year ago.
5294171	5299893	So Sony has not been, you know, and what I always had said was that, you know, wait till PS2 starts to die out, you know.
5300353	5306816	I mean, they're still making games for it, but it's not too far off that we're going to hear of the PS3 or whatever their new system's going to be.
5307961	5309022	and Loki says already is.
5309042	5310584	I haven't been keeping me up.
5310644	5316472	I say once it hits $99, which is pretty soon, that's when everybody had a modded PlayStation.
5316512	5316872	Exactly.
5316912	5318554	That's when everybody's going to have a modded PlayStation 2.
5318694	5320377	Except me, I have no reason for one.
5320617	5322179	I honestly have no reason to get a modded PlayStation.
5322279	5323080	Here's my point, though.
5323675	5325496	There's a newer mod chip called the DMS3.
5326337	5328178	I think you can go to DMS3.com.
5328438	5329119	It'll bring it up.
5329439	5336764	This mod chip, it's just as difficult to mod your PlayStation 2 as it is with any of the other PS2 mod chips, but this one has flash memory on it.
5337405	5344029	And it has two BIOS flashes on it, and you can get updates, which you burn onto CDs,
5345050	5347952	from their site that flash it to the newest BIOS.
5347992	5350734	So say a new game comes out and it detects the mod chip.
5351094	5352015	You go to their newest site.
5352295	5353315	They are on top of it.
5353395	5355117	You download their little BIOS flash.
5355437	5356918	You burn it in a CD, put it in your PS2.
5357904	5358965	There you go, you can play the game now.
5359345	5368232	Also, because of that, there's all these other new features on the DMS3 where you can, when you're loading your PS2, you hold a button down, it sets it to turn off mod chip.
5368672	5379300	So if you want to play online games, like say you actually bought a real copy of Final Fantasy XI, and it's locking you out of their online server because you have a mod chip, you hold the button down, it disables your mod chip, now you can play online.
5379881	5382623	This new DMS3 mod chip is the one to get, I'm telling you.
5383403	5385305	It's time you could mod your freaking PS2s.
5386661	5391105	I don't want people going out there saying that it's worthless, because you can do it now.
5391385	5396469	I mean, it's just... But there may not be a reason to do it.
5396530	5397410	For some people, there's no reason.
5397450	5398151	For me, there's no reason.
5398171	5399852	There is nothing left I want to play on PS2.
5399992	5400293	Nothing.
5400553	5405217	Well, for me, I think all... And I have a Japanese... Everything I want to play is Japanese, anyway.
5405958	5408460	Now, technically, with a mod chip, I can play the Japanese games, but...
5409969	5410790	There's just not that many.
5410810	5411370	There's not enough.
5411450	5413051	Okay, your point is taken.
5413872	5417594	But there's some of us untrustworthy people out there who want to play our other games.
5419635	5421697	Pictures of our games.
5422097	5424118	You tell me how to mod my GameCube, I'm on it.
5424138	5425799	Because I play my GameCube more than anything else.
5425859	5427701	I don't think you're ever going to need to mod your GameCube.
5427761	5430162	Eventually there's going to be a way around it, like Loki just said.
5430743	5431103	Exactly.
5432096	5433658	There's always going to be a way around it.
5433698	5433979	You know what?
5433999	5435300	This is what they all say.
5435340	5437263	When PS3 comes out, it's going to be online.
5437403	5438825	You're going to download your games online.
5438885	5439746	Everything's going to be online.
5439766	5441649	You're not going to be able to mod this shit anymore.
5442350	5443011	Never going to happen.
5443091	5444072	Why do you say that, LB?
5445134	5445815	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5476047	5483030	Well, what about something like iTunes, which is the way you can download music online, and they've sold, what, 10 million songs today.
5483070	5484431	It's the most successful online one.
5484791	5494536	True, it's not nearly as big as going into the store and buying things, but for those people that prefer to buy their things online, they have a pretty viable option, and it's somewhat successful.
5495036	5498298	For people who are talking, I think Baka is saying, was it DMS3 or DMX?
5498378	5499618	It's DMS3.
5499938	5502039	Go to DMS3.com, you can find out about it.
5502139	5508142	But the thing is, though, is I don't like not buy a game because I only like a portion of the game.
5509222	5513504	See, now with CDs, I may only like one song, so I'm only going to buy that one song.
5513644	5519487	If the only way I can buy that song is online, then yeah, I'm going to go ahead and do that because there might not be a single for that.
5520649	5526491	In my case, I don't buy music because it's too damn expensive and the artists mostly suck.
5526531	5531353	If I want to discover new music, I'm going to go about it the illegal way and download it for free.
5532113	5540536	Or, I'm going to go listen to those independent artists that don't get any coverage and those normally end up being better than the most mainstream artists anyways.
5541136	5545898	So, why should I spend money and pay for your product when it stinks?
5546398	5546698	When it...
5547398	5548058	DarkSakura.com
5578126	5579207	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5596380	5596800	Well, yeah.
5597140	5598201	Oh, the big bad R.I.A.
5598221	5600142	is going to track us down.
5600182	5600562	Whatever.
5600602	5603204	You know, I don't listen to a lot of music in the first place.
5603264	5605505	Most of the music I listen to is just Bomani stuff.
5606466	5607326	Homemade remixes.
5607626	5609147	I don't listen to a lot of mainstream stuff.
5610068	5614350	I was hoping to save the iTunes topic for Vanilla Sky tomorrow night, but whatever.
5614370	5614750	That's fine.
5615511	5617292	On topic of mainstream stuff, real quick.
5617672	5617892	Okay.
5617912	5617992	Okay.
5619292	5619933	and DarkSakura.
5634943	5635743	Thank you for watching!
5653474	5656715	To some extent, I believe in supporting the artist for a song I really, really like.
5656815	5658756	And the songs I downloaded, I really, really like.
5659276	5664018	And B, because when I try to find these songs on FileShare, I get shit copies.
5664438	5668540	Every time I get lousy volume, I get just cut things.
5668940	5669500	And you know what?
5669620	5674662	It is just worth the goddamn dollar to just get a perfect quality song the first time.
5675863	5676163	The end.
5676563	5676903	That's me.
5677103	5678964	But we'll talk more about iTunes tomorrow.
5680517	5687139	I'm sorry, so you wanted to say... Oh, what I was going to say is that people who will probably go, oh no, piracy would be where it is now, even if they did do it.
5689320	5697463	It may have gotten to the point eventually, but not as quickly, because I believe that once you put a... What do you call it?
5697483	5698143	What am I looking for?
5698203	5702625	You put like a rule or a... God, obstacle.
5702705	5707787	You put an obstacle in the way of somebody, and they want to overcome it, they will, and they'll find a way to overcome it.
5707807	5708087	You put...
5708985	5709787	Thanks for watching!
5719221	5720422	I think you made, that's a good point.
5720442	5726288	I mean, if they had put it up, they wouldn't be having as much problems right now with what they've announced.
5726308	5726828	But they didn't.
5727048	5727529	End of story.
5728089	5733614	RAA did not act fast enough, which is why the MPAA is trying so hard right now with the movies thing.
5734175	5741121	They're trying to get all these movie services up and going, and although Loki's right, there's not that many people that really want to watch movies online.
5742002	5742763	Yeah, you want to go in.
5742783	5743263	They're trying.
5743503	5745105	Movies is a thing that will never...
5746479	5747160	Thanks for watching!
5764582	5766083	You are changing experience.
5766203	5771924	Because now not only do I have to go buy a game system that's fucking expensive when it comes out because they have all these new features.
5772424	5774225	Now I have to buy a membership online.
5774325	5777406	Now I have to buy cable internet where I might not have it.
5777846	5779386	No, because it's not going to work on dial-up.
5779726	5783628	Oh, but if I do have dial-up, it's going to take four goddamn years to download the goddamn game.
5783948	5787509	And what if there's a disconnection on, you know, what if my cable goes out or something?
5787829	5788609	There goes my game.
5788849	5791510	I don't have my game stored on my hard drive because that crashes too.
5791630	5791910	It's just...
5792768	5793369	Too much stuff.
5793409	5794590	You're going to have a game.
5794810	5797553	How are they going to rent product then out at the stores?
5797913	5802358	The rental businesses for games are going to go out because it's all online supposedly.
5802758	5804480	But the MPAA would not care.
5804720	5805942	They would love to see that happen.
5807563	5810426	The MPAA would care because people like to rent movies.
5810466	5811668	They don't like to buy movies.
5812188	5812448	Okay?
5812688	5814049	Because renting a movie costs $5.
5814349	5815789	You see it once, you're done.
5816089	5824932	Instead of investing, you know, that money and watching that movie and having it at home, like I have tons of movies I buy and don't watch, it's just stupid.
5825493	5831075	But if they could be in control of the movie renting and not Blockbuster, that's capitalism.
5831875	5836556	See, like I said, the movie renting and movie business will not change completely.
5836616	5838017	Like, it won't go completely online.
5838037	5840618	Because regardless of whether people want to buy or rent or whatever...
5841508	5847010	People still want to see movies on the big screen and if they want to rent then they'll go to the movie rental places and rent them.
5847030	5848051	Those won't go out of business.
5848151	5861356	Maybe renting video games will go, but the fact is that they're obviously not going to implement or try to implement something like that until every internet connection in America is broadband.
5862026	5866089	Until it's standard to get broadband and extremely cost efficient.
5866669	5870972	The only way it'll ever be like that is when broadband becomes as common as electricity.
5871213	5871953	Exactly.
5871993	5876516	Which is something that they've talked about in the last, like, five years ago.
5876536	5877497	There was a thing called...
5878493	5888857	I can't remember, I used to have the website for it, but they were basically saying that they could get speeds of like fiber optic speed, you know how fast fiber optic networks go, that kind of speed from your electrical outlet.
5889518	5902683	They could do this thing where they could make the, they take the digital signal from wherever the server is, they convert it to analog, and they put it in I think a really, really low frequency, just kind of like how DSL is, and they run it through the power lines.
5903064	5906145	And it goes at like fiber optic speeds.
5906645	5917709	And they just have to install these, they have to build these up, these like switching boxes in cities in certain areas because there's only so much, there's a signal degradation that happens, you know.
5918770	5922371	And so that was like five years ago and they said they were still working on it and they want it.
5922431	5932795	But basically that kind of idea makes you wonder, you know, in the near future, in like the next ten years, we could see where you plug in your appliance, your computer, to the wall and it's got an internet connection.
5933836	5936457	They talk about fridges with internet connection and all this crazy stuff.
5936477	5938058	Yeah, they talk about that on the same page.
5938098	5941359	They said something about how, like, what if your toaster was plugged in.
5941539	5943600	I don't want my toaster being plugged in the internet, obviously.
5943640	5947021	I don't want freaking, like, advertisements burning onto my toast.
5947881	5949922	My toaster comes up and it's got an Apple logo on it.
5950362	5953403	I can see it writing in your journal, today kind of sucked.
5953483	5957125	A hacker broke into my toaster today and started burning my bread.
5957865	5958385	Exactly.
5958705	5960326	See, I don't want that kind of thing.
5960766	5961086	All right.
5961587	5963749	I just want to bring up a point from the chat room real fast.
5964130	5965571	John Fields makes a pretty good point.
5965631	5973819	He says, All I have to say, if the MPAA had control of renting, unfair monopoly that the government would thus force Blockbuster to take over again.
5973879	5976222	So he's suggesting that the MPAA did have control of all of this stuff.
5976835	5978097	Thank you for watching!
5995037	5998360	to do this all online, and they will fight this to the death.
5998640	6007888	You have to understand, most of the people that you talk to out there, I mean, because we have our exposure with our friends who are all connected to the internet, all wired individuals.
6007988	6012532	But your average Joe doesn't know jack about computers, won't touch it because they act like it's the devil.
6013113	6013793	My father.
6014654	6018618	They don't get it, and if they switch it all to online, they're never going to get it.
6018638	6019078	Yeah, but you know what?
6019098	6019939	Those people are dying.
6020519	6021400	And in about 20 years...
6022541	6026185	It's not going to... Everybody on the earth will know how to use a computer.
6026225	6026966	Well, I'm sorry.
6027166	6027807	I shouldn't say that.
6027927	6033273	Because America's... Everybody in America, in the industrialized nations, will know how to use a computer.
6033774	6037238	I retract my statement because there's countries that aren't going to still be on computers.
6037578	6038139	Here's proof.
6038659	6047306	In the 80s, in the late 70s, like when arcade games and stuff were coming out, like, you know, late, the 70s, and I think actually, I don't remember, my timelines are bad.
6047787	6054813	Anyway, people who played arcade games, you know, probably usually a lot of them were kind of older, they were like in their late teens, 20s and stuff.
6055794	6062299	Video game consoles started coming out, and with the newer generations, kids started playing at younger ages, 8 or 9, you know, with Nintendo.
6062980	6064101	My friend's brother...
6064445	6065365	I just wanna make a quick plug.
6065385	6066946	On Vanilla Sky tomorrow night, we're gonna bring up an article
6087952	6094580	where they talk about these young kids and they're going to make these young kids play games that we played when we were young kids.
6094640	6097223	Just wait to hear what they have to say.
6097563	6099766	You are going to feel so old tomorrow night.
6099786	6100687	7 o'clock, Vanilla Sky.
6100727	6101728	I love that idea.
6107119	6107980	I don't understand.
6108120	6109621	The characters don't talk to you.
6109941	6110761	Like, vocally.
6111201	6112462	So, which block am I?
6113803	6115104	Ew, it's... What is this?
6115224	6116565	This little blocky thing?
6117005	6118366	Why does that... It's like mustard.
6118406	6119226	It's attacking me.
6119246	6121648	Is there anything else you want to say about mod chips, Brad?
6121668	6123269	We've kind of got off on all these tangents tonight.
6123449	6127591	You know, for being... Half of us being sick, we sure have a lot to say tonight.
6127711	6130893	It's like we're just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah-ing from one topic to another.
6130953	6131514	But that's alright.
6131554	6132314	I kind of like it, so...
6134316	6136519	There may not be any organization involved today.
6136539	6137580	That's alright, that's alright.
6137820	6138501	That's the sickness.
6139242	6141424	That's the sickness, this extreme inorganization.
6141444	6142866	Is there anything else you want to say about Monchips?
6143427	6144948	I didn't jump to the cage match.
6146030	6147251	There will always be a way.
6147792	6149654	People who are out there saying, no, it's worthless.
6149694	6152397	No, there will always be a way.
6152637	6152877	Alright.
6154497	6162820	Okay, if you'd like to comment on any of that, head on over to our chatroom, www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat.
6163700	6165140	And join in our chatroom.
6165560	6171802	And, by the way, being in our chatroom is the only way that you can participate in tonight's one and only Cage Match.
6173123	6182986	Yes, the Orange Lounge Cage Match is where we're going to play three songs back-to-back, one picked by me, one picked by DarkSakura, even though she's not here, she submitted her vote online to me, and one picked by Loki.
6184188	6185669	and you can vote for one of those three songs.
6185749	6193414	The winner goes into musical rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio, so you, the chatroom, have the power to decide which song will be played all week.
6193855	6200359	We start off with last week's winner, which was a song brought to us by Loki, and since it was last week's winner, we're only going to hear a clip of it.
6201079	6204802	The song is P8107, and it's a remix of Paranoia by...
6205580	6205980	Onoken.
6206321	6207061	Thank you, Onoken.
6208062	6208822	So here it is.
6208883	6211044	This is a clip because it was last week's winner.
6211064	6211985	You'll get to hear a little bit of it.
6212325	6214187	Song number one tonight, last week's winner, P8107.
6214207	6215187	Here we go.
6304276	6306257	Alright, that's song number one for tonight.
6306297	6308959	That's P8107 by Ono Ken.
6309660	6313522	Song number two tonight is my pick, and you get to hear the whole thing because it's a new song.
6314463	6319926	I was on the internet not too long ago just downloading a bunch of remixes by Above and Beyond because I fucking love them, they're great.
6320446	6323688	And so I wanted to get as many remixes by them as I could, and this is one of the ones I got.
6324209	6329212	This is an artist called Ministry of Sound, and the song is Far From In Love, and it's the Above and Beyond mix.
6329392	6329732	Enjoy.
6330573	6332474	Song number two tonight that you can vote for in the cage match.
6426172	6436649	I can see behind your eyes that you're afraid of who you are All this silence now between us, I'm amazed we've come this far, far from it
6453066	6456192	Like a fire burn to memory, I know this is where it ends
6535023	6536370	Thank you for watching!
6596343	6609027	Alright, that was, I'm being corrected on the artist, sorry guys, that was actually Above and Beyond themselves doing that song, even better in my opinion, Far From In Love is the song, and if you're curious about that edit, it is from the CD Transnation 2003, which is an import, by the way.
6609447	6612148	Let's go around the room and see what people thought of that, start off with Loki.
6614388	6615769	It's pretty cool, I liked it.
6616949	6620070	This is Above and Beyond, so I can't go wrong with it.
6621420	6626603	Now if it was Above and Beyond remixed by Paul Oakenpole, yeah, that would have been cool.
6626903	6628244	But yeah, I give it an 8.
6630005	6633487	Jamie's submitted her vote via the internet since she's out sick today.
6633527	6636308	If you guys are just joining us, Jamie's out sick today.
6636388	6640631	She says, Rob, your song gets a 7.8 for being transalicious.
6640731	6641811	No wait, I give it an 8.
6642752	6644333	She's decided to be nice and round up.
6644513	6645073	Wasn't that kind?
6645934	6646454	My thoughts.
6647150	6648070	God, it's great.
6648210	6651271	And DarkTips3 said in the chatroom, it sounds like a total DDR song.
6651311	6651671	You're right.
6651731	6652431	Yeah, it's cool.
6652491	6652931	I like it.
6653311	6657732	And it gets a 9 for me, because Above and Beyond is like the shit.
6657793	6658173	I love them.
6658313	6658993	So, there you go.
6659433	6659753	Bradley.
6660913	6661513	Kind of pretty cool.
6662274	6662774	Give it an 8.5.
6662814	6662914	Brad.
6662974	6667515	Oh, you don't have a mic?
6669835	6671076	I thought you had a mic over there.
6675217	6676277	I wasn't listening to it.
6676477	6676797	Sorry.
6677421	6684263	Loki was showing me this cool, uh... I don't know if Ken's beaten any SVX files on his simulator, so... Sorry, I didn't hear it.
6686863	6688844	You didn't... You didn't hear any of it at all?
6689004	6689904	You were standing right there!
6691924	6693204	This was Loki's pick, or whose?
6693785	6694085	Yours?
6694785	6695405	I'm gonna give it a one.
6696785	6697245	What the hell?
6697785	6698166	Alright.
6698726	6701246	That was, uh, song number two, Above and Beyond, Far From Unloved.
6701666	6703407	Here is... What?
6703907	6704567	We're doing what again?
6706580	6708861	Oh, I thought the show was fucking up.
6709221	6711902	Alright, song number three is Jamie's pick.
6711942	6713343	She sends this along.
6713383	6717865	Even though she can't be here, she wants you all to hear it and hope that it'll win tonight's cage match.
6717905	6718325	Here it is.
6719525	6721366	I listened to this song before the show a little bit.
6721406	6722047	It's pretty good.
6722767	6723767	It's an Avex song.
6723887	6724728	You guys know Avex.
6725108	6727169	2DX licenses a lot of tracks from them.
6729192	6730873	Getting mic switched on me, okay.
6730913	6736035	The song is called Ways of Love, and the artist is CyberX featuring Jody Watley.
6736615	6739736	And it's from an album called CyberX, so give this a try.
6739756	6741817	If you like Avex tracks, you just might like this.
6742137	6744838	This is Jamie's pick tonight.
6744878	6747159	CyberX featuring Jody Watley with Waves.
6822162	6837851	Feel the waves of love Messages we send Feel the waves of love There's a new horizon With the rising sun We can reach the heavens On the waves of love The waves of love
6943573	6944854	Thank you for watching!
6986651	6987012	All right.
7012606	7015392	CyberX featuring Jody Watley with Waves of Love.
7015913	7016594	Loki, what'd you think?
7016614	7018878	I thought it was pretty cool.
7020561	7021443	I'm upbeat this week.
7021483	7023988	See, I don't have anything negative to say about those songs.
7024529	7024909	I give it an 8.
7028117	7038562	I liked it in the beginning, but it just kind of, I don't know, kind of dragged for me towards the end, but I do typically like most Avex tracks, so I'll be nice and give it seven and a half.
7039443	7042344	The trance song is supposed to sound the same for like seven minutes.
7042364	7044605	It's different.
7044665	7046046	I can't explain it, but it's different.
7046106	7047086	Just go with it, okay?
7048127	7053249	Jamie sends her vote online, and she says, of course, her song gets a ten for being exciting trance.
7054570	7057371	Bradley, or Brad, whoever gets the mic first.
7060612	7061532	Dumbass, dude!
7061972	7063813	Okay, hold on, I gotta tell you if you're on camera yet.
7065273	7065893	Uh, got it!
7068033	7068773	It was okay.
7068833	7070814	I wasn't going away, so give it a 7.
7070854	7074374	There's a nice picture of Brad's ass sticking up in the air.
7081796	7084136	Wait, hold on.
7084336	7085436	Look at the webcam, people.
7085917	7086337	Okay, anyway.
7086377	7086737	Brad!
7087537	7087657	Um...
7088658	7093119	I've said before to other people I don't really like trance songs unless it's a Kiriyama Oka, so I'm giving it a 5.
7094700	7095160	Ooh.
7095480	7096500	You're mean.
7096540	7097441	I'm not trying to be mean.
7097541	7101222	I really, just trance can't really be interesting unless it's a Kiriyama Oka.
7101242	7102142	Alright, alright.
7102162	7103943	You're entitled to your opinion, even if it sucks.
7104183	7104443	Alright.
7106025	7106506	Here we go.
7107066	7107807	Here's a recap.
7107847	7110750	You can send your votes in very soon, but you have to be in the chat room.
7111110	7111710	And you know what?
7111790	7114553	Now is a great night to be in our chat room because it's crowded in there.
7114573	7115674	There's lots of people in there tonight.
7116355	7118757	Now, why aren't all of you on the stream?
7118777	7121960	Because I know that there's more people in the chat room than are on the stream.
7122020	7123481	So shame on you.
7123501	7124402	Shame on you.
7124602	7126144	www.callybomani.com.

7130848	7131749	We want to meet new people tonight.
7132102	7133985	Okay, keep the microphone over there, Brad.
7134005	7136027	Here you go, you can vote for one of these three songs.
7136929	7141335	Last week's winner, P1... Hey, shut up.
7142116	7142997	Here's a recap.
7143658	7144619	First song you can vote for, P8107.
7157014	7162460	Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight, Above and Beyond with Far From In Love.
7170888	7175773	Alright, and song number three you can vote for tonight is CyberX featuring Jody Watley with Waves of Love.
7185448	7186410	Alright, there you go.
7186490	7188072	Place vote now!
7188472	7191416	Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your vote.
7191436	7195862	If you don't know how to do that, just ask somebody and they'll tell you how you send a private message to Sky.
7195922	7197965	Votes made public in the chatroom don't count!
7199707	7200047	Alright.
7201669	7201910	So...
7203266	7206527	Back to the show while we tally up those votes for cage matches as they come in.
7207788	7211189	Loki, tell us about this other project you've kind of been working on lately.
7211930	7212930	You're working on it now.
7212970	7214651	You've been working on it for a little while.
7214831	7215431	What's up with this?
7215471	7220593	You're kind of taking Step Mania modification to the extreme from what I see, no pun intended.
7223035	7229017	Well, I'm just right now, because no one can see this out there in radio land.
7229737	7230998	I'm making a new banner.
7234352	7252219	I've been trying to pitch an idea to Keith at Golfland because I've seen it done before where basically you wire a Stepmania PC to a DDR machine and run Stepmania on there.
7252239	7258241	Well, Stepmania is meant to run as an arcade machine itself because it's got options for credits and all that stuff, so...
7259466	7267728	Obviously, that's what I'm doing here in-house with cabinets being built, but I thought, you know, why not do that in an arcade, too?
7268348	7278690	So, I've been basically looking into licensing rights and what it would cost, you know, because obviously I'm not going to ask Konami for permission, because, no, they're never going to say yes, so we're doing it anyways.
7279770	7285251	But I've been looking into, like, if, you know, a music artist or something was to come after me, how...
7286411	7314126	you know, what actual licensing rights we would need, so I checked into it, basically a set mini-based game could be considered a jukebox because it's just, you know, music being played and so it would fall under jukebox license rights, I think I don't know, it's a gray area but it only costs $364 a year to actually legally license it, but if we did all, like, Konami original stuff and just, basically it's going to be, you know, I want to
7315194	7315434	and so on.
7332566	7336748	That's what I'm gonna do, and right now I'm making a banner for Dance Dance Revolution EX2.
7336788	7338769	That's what I've got right now.
7339490	7340690	What the hell are you doing?!
7341191	7342151	You fucking idiot!
7343012	7346133	Brad making stupid gestures into the camera.
7346573	7348294	But, yeah, it's going along pretty good.
7348314	7355658	Um, the banner looks pretty, you know, official, except it's kind of... Looks like it's kind of squashed vertically, I have to fix that.
7356499	7356899	But, um...
7361909	7362571	Thank you for watching!
7375808	7378749	Right now, the feasibility is probably not going to... It's not going to happen there.
7378809	7381190	But this is just for my own, you know, machine.
7381991	7389174	Pretty much... Because if you think about it, I could probably make a better mix than Konami can, so... Why not give it a chance?
7389234	7391075	And I pose the option to them.
7391135	7392215	I'm like, look at it.
7392515	7400258	Pass the initial investment of buying the actual PC, which would pay for itself pretty quickly since DDR machines make a ton of money.
7400519	7403380	You'd have free upgrades for life on that damn thing, so...
7404714	7407677	Software upgrades would be easy, but, you know, whatever.
7409038	7410199	So that's what I've been doing on there.
7412421	7413562	So you think you're going to get away with it?
7413643	7422611	I mean, I realize that you're saying in the end it's probably not going to make it, but let's say it does make it somehow, or you buy an arcade, you win a lottery, buy an arcade, and put this machine in it, you think you'll make it?
7424707	7438819	Well, yeah, they're really the only people that could rain on my parade, if that were to ever happen, would be the people that play the game itself religiously, because they're like, oh, oh my god, you know, that's not an official Konami game, that's a poop bag, you're running out of sim.
7439099	7452451	But they're looking past, you know, what it actually is, and not just playing it for what it's supposed to be, which is just a game, you know, and if Konami's going to stop making arcade games, you know, the US isn't making arcade games for DDR,
7453487	7457470	and all these games are getting stagnant in arcades, people are going to go one of two routes.
7457490	7475541	They're either going to spend $1,500 to buy some hacked bootleg, which is looking like shit, or they're going to run software like this that you can emulate, you know, pretty much, you know, emulate DDR perfectly and have, you know, new features added to it that aren't seen in any of the games.
7476041	7476802	Plus, you know, you're...
7477442	7477822	DarkSakura.com
7498095	7501078	And we're talking like full unlocks here.
7501098	7503540	400 songs at least on this mix.
7503880	7509404	I mean, if you put like tons and tons and tons of unlocks on there, people will be playing this game forever.
7509505	7512187	I mean, it won't ever, you know, get boring.
7512227	7514669	If people get bored of a song, put a new song on there.
7515570	7526959	I don't see what the big deal would be if, I mean, other than, you know, well, Konami not getting credit for it or, you know, if they stop making DDR and you can't buy them anymore, then I guess that would, you know,
7527782	7532004	Fallen, the main of Abandonware, and, you know, I don't know.
7532284	7541888	I just, I think, unless, you know, people made it, like, a real big deal about it, you know, and it's not like I'm selling it, you know, we're just, it's a one arcade exclusive thing.
7542348	7543868	I don't see what the big deal would be.
7546069	7550711	But, um, we should have never invited him over.
7552691	7553171	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7575146	7580350	I want to talk about DDRXbox for a minute, because there was some news this week about DDRXbox, and that is that it's gone gold.
7580831	7585895	No, it's not sold a certain amount of copies, but it's finished.
7586155	7589497	It's in the can, it's done, and it's going to be out November 18th.
7589898	7595542	It's kind of interesting, not a lot of knowledge about DDRXbox right now when it comes to songs.
7595582	7601327	We know that there's going to be a remix of Absolute in it, we know that it has shiny disco balls in it, the quickening...
7601967	7605271	Castles in the Sky, Mad Blast, I think was another one.
7605571	7606232	Is that what it's called?
7606252	7607813	The Dance Maniacs song, Mad Blast?
7610176	7611197	Mind Parasite.
7611257	7611977	What's Mad Blast?
7611997	7612658	What am I thinking of?
7613459	7614320	Oh, I'm thinking of the Car Freaks.
7616342	7616902	Ah, okay.
7617683	7617983	Alright.
7625436	7631620	Okay, but there's just not a lot to really talk about right now because they haven't been releasing a whole lot of information really.
7631640	7633821	They've all been just kind of working on it.
7634682	7639685	The anticipation from what I feel is not quite as big as it is for a typical PlayStation release.
7639705	7646089	I don't know if people are just scared because it's different or whatever, or maybe just because the marketing hasn't kicked in yet, but I don't know.
7646109	7647890	There just doesn't seem to be a lot of excitement about it.
7647930	7648210	I just...
7649685	7663458	Wouldn't it be interesting if this did well, that maybe Konami of Hawaii were to put together some new arcade release with their brand new interface they've done and their more competitive DDR-ness they have in there and all that stuff?
7665900	7667822	Do you have something to add to this conversation?
7668283	7671726	That's how I said Merry Christmas in Hawaiian.
7672427	7673648	Something like that.
7677264	7679805	Would you fucking talk about something worthwhile, Rob?
7680525	7682145	Wait, you don't think Xbox is worthwhile?
7682425	7682725	No.
7683125	7683605	Why not?
7683825	7684325	Xbox.
7685686	7686486	You know what, though?
7686546	7700929	There's a lot of folks that, you know... Yeah, those are the same people who... play sports games, like football, outside, where there's bears.
7700969	7701229	All right.
7701809	7701889	Um...
7703115	7709918	The only other songs we know, other than those we just mentioned, Colors by DJ Taka from Xtreme is going to show up.
7710378	7712318	And Sugaru, Revenge vs. Desire.
7712338	7715900	And then there were a few more from some list I saw, but I don't remember it.
7716080	7717160	So that's that.
7717220	7721462	We have not had an official song list come out from Konami.
7721622	7722202	That's the point.
7722542	7729545	But now that the game's gone gold, maybe they'll send some kind of... I don't know.
7730085	7730665	They'll do something.
7732034	7742788	Mecha Lecha Hi, Mecha Heidi Ho Alright, let's get to tonight's cage match winner Mecha Lecha Hi, Mecha Johnny Ho Tonight's cage match winner, ladies and gentlemen, is It's a tie
7745575	7745775	What?
7746535	7747095	It's a tie.
7747255	7747775	Between who?
7747815	7748456	So who wins?
7748936	7749876	So this is how we do it.
7750236	7751736	Because the one song that didn't tie.
7751756	7752797	This is the interesting thing.
7752897	7754397	It's a tie by one vote.
7754737	7757818	If one person had voted for the other song, it would have been a three-way tie.
7758418	7759878	So it was very close tonight.
7759958	7760698	Ooh, a three-way.
7760798	7761799	I know, ooh, a three-way.
7762279	7763819	So, here we go.
7764739	7767060	The two songs that tied tonight were last week's winner, P8107.
7772851	7777177	And the second song that tied tonight was Above and Beyond with Far From the Love.
7779961	7783686	And CyberX and Jody Watley was one vote away.
7784927	7788348	So, that means DarkSakura gets to pick who wins?
7788368	7794209	That's right, because the rules say the host whose song didn't win gets to break the tie.
7794269	7795949	But she's not here, what do we do?
7796109	7800830	Well, but she is here in spirit, she's in the chat room, so I'm going to ask her to send her vote along.
7801310	7805051	So we'll find out who won the cage match after the break.
7805291	7808332	I'm going to give her the break to deliberate and send her vote if she wants.
7808372	7810292	Oh, never mind, she's already sent it, so let's see.
7811913	7812493	And the winner is...
7814673	7818435	Jamie has voted for Far From In Love.
7818615	7820016	So that is the winner for tonight.
7825436	7827458	in a very, very close, probably the closest cage match yet.
7827978	7830920	I demand a re- Yeah, we're going to have a re-call now.
7830940	7831701	A re-count.
7832421	7833802	It's all your chads, people.
7834083	7834643	Make sure you puncture.
7834663	7836585	Loki's song already won two weeks in a row.
7836605	7837665	It was time for it to go.
7838206	7838746	Whatever, dude.
7838766	7842949	He wants to do a new song next week anyway, and she says, eat trance.
7843530	7846372	When she voted for it, she said, eat trance.
7847092	7847713	I'm not laughing.
7850839	7851179	All right.
7852719	7853280	There you go.
7853380	7857640	That's tonight's Winter of the Cage match and goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lock Radio.
7857660	7859561	We're going to do a break now.
7859581	7861581	You'd like to fuck my recount, wouldn't you?
7865522	7870463	When we come back from this little break of music, we're going to do the FUs of the week.
7870563	7872684	So send those over private message to me.
7872804	7878045	Hi, I'm Sky and I'm in the chat room and I'm just waiting to hear your FUs because we're going to read them very soon.
7878085	7878625	In the meantime...
7879440	7880904	Let's do a break of music.
7881004	7882488	Start it off with a little bit of Xenon.
7884553	7885235	Xenon
7929058	7930219	Thanks for watching!
8003470	8004151	DarkSakura
8025962	8026723	DarkSakura DarkSakura
8114476	8115978	Thank you for watching!
8230111	8235774	Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge Bay Money Music and More show?
8236054	8243198	The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
8243518	8245519	It's unearthly.
8245739	8249481	It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
8250061	8253984	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 65 in progress.
8254544	8256685	And Dark Sakura's out sick tonight, unfortunately.
8256725	8258526	We wish her she gets better soon.
8259537	8287808	Orange Lounge Radio, music you hump to Thank you Also, Loki and I are sick, but somehow we're continuing to go on I think Loki's not quite as bad off as either Jamie or myself And I'm probably not as bad off as Jamie I talked to her on the phone earlier, she sounded pretty bad So, I'm somehow faking my way through this show tonight Joining me tonight, LankyStyle, over there, hello Baka's complaining there's nothing in the webcam, so I have to go back to my crazy antics No, no, Baka, shut up And Arcadian42's here too
8289329	8289529	Yo.
8290110	8290170	Yo.
8312936	8319400	And it's got, basically, it looks exactly like DDR Extreme, except it's blue in the background.
8319580	8323163	And I say blue in the background, you know where there'd be green checkers?
8323543	8324704	Now it's just solid blue.
8325945	8326825	Which is lame.
8327486	8332389	But that's what it is, and then the, it's like they didn't really know what they were doing when they made it.
8333309	8336612	And, I don't know, it's just, it's pretty lame.
8338493	8341595	And according to this, there's not really any new songs, it looks like, I don't know.
8345055	8348456	Alright, as promised, now it's time to get into the FUs of the week.
8348756	8353997	And we're going to start off with Jamie's FUs, even though she's not here, we do have her FUs, so let's start.
8359919	8361799	Here is justice.
8361839	8363780	Here is justice.
8370599	8372742	F you to stupid people on Ragnarok Online.
8372782	8373583	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
8373603	8374564	She has real F yous.
8375165	8375625	Here they are.
8376366	8383074	DarkSakura would like to say F you to being sick and that I can't take off work because of my impending trip to Alabama.
8384236	8385898	F you number two is missing the show.
8386639	8388841	F you number three is not having toilet paper.
8390437	8392038	That must be an interesting house right now.
8392078	8392979	Yeah, we've got plenty.
8393439	8395040	Jamie, you should have come over.
8395060	8395720	We've got plenty.
8395761	8403105	We bought like 50 gazillion packs in one at Ralph's.
8403285	8405567	FU number four, my nose is rubbed raw.
8407048	8409429	FU number five, not having good food at home.
8410990	8411931	FU to being hot.
8412891	8415533	FU to people who don't pay enough attention to the world around them.
8416600	8421583	F you to selfish frivolity, I'm guilty of the same, and not being able to save money.
8422823	8428386	F you to bad grammar and spelling, and lastly, F you number 10 from DarkSakura, F you to idiots.
8430047	8431588	Zelda, more like Zelda.
8433689	8434089	Shut up.
8434670	8436751	Alright, Loki's turn, your F yous.
8441489	8446031	F you to Sacramento, because I don't like you at all.
8447031	8452533	In fact, I really, really, really, really, really hate downtown Sac, because every time I drive down there, I get lost.
8453053	8455494	Because all their streets go one way, and it sucks.
8455694	8458295	And they don't label their streets, and they have them all messed up.
8458915	8459375	It just sucks.
8459435	8460896	And I can't find food down there.
8461956	8463237	I hate downtown Sac.
8463497	8464897	And they're making me drive down there.
8465538	8466178	And it sucks.
8468098	8477181	F you to Fox News Because, actually F you to any 24 hour news channel Because you covered the same story 50,000 times You know why?
8477801	8486864	Because actual news doesn't happen Or actual interesting news doesn't happen all the time So why do they even have 24 hour news networks in the first place?
8487724	8491965	Since you're just covering the same shit over and over and over again Why not just cover it once?
8492856	8495177	at the normal news time like ordinary news works.
8495277	8499759	So basically, point for our news networks are useless.
8500860	8504261	Um, FUG4 because they're just lame.
8506302	8507663	FUG Brad because he's an idiot.
8508163	8514766	And, um, also, um, that's so distracting.
8515867	8516807	Stop jumping!
8518168	8518808	God damn it.
8520592	8526896	F you to my cold, because now not only am I sick, but I have to go to jury duty, and that still sucks.
8527577	8530639	F you to jury duty, because I really don't like it.
8531619	8539224	And, you know, I honestly, I don't like people that much, so I didn't really want to be there in the first place.
8539484	8543047	And people waiting out in front of jury duty always have something stupid to say.
8544168	8548110	Like, I have to listen to this woman talk about how the water treatment plant works.
8548370	8549251	Like, I really care.
8549881	8550502	I just don't.
8551002	8558630	It's just like, he keeps blabbing on about it over and over, and there's some guy that works with B, and just, ugh, can't wait for the B over with.
8562154	8566259	And finally, put the damn coin door down!
8566599	8568341	That's way across the line, buddy.
8572438	8572778	Oh, no.
8573059	8579163	No, I was more... If we'd done the FUs on Wednesday, it would have been so much better, because I came in just angry as hell.
8579863	8583405	I have that bit taped, so I can play it later in the future if you want.
8584606	8584986	Sweet.
8586587	8591331	No, but I'm just like... It sucks because now I'm not angsty on the weekends.
8591391	8594132	I just kind of relax by the time Sunday comes around, you know?
8594533	8595794	So I was angry at first.
8595834	8597895	Like, I was totally pissed off about the whole, like,
8598869	8604291	Um, jury duty thing, but now I'm just kind of like calm, you know, I'm ready for it tomorrow, because it's not that bad.
8604911	8608312	But, I don't know what the hell he's doing.
8608332	8616894	F you to the fact that they didn't get to go out to go all-flanks, they really wanted to, and, you know, circumstances prevented that, so, oh well.
8618674	8619155	I'm done.
8620895	8621335	My turn.
8622235	8627917	Um, my biggest F you this week, obviously, is being sick, because when you're sick, you don't feel like doing shit.
8632596	8657831	F you to my friend who went out to the bar with me, Ice Princess F you to Ice Princess for being a drunken fucker on Friday night and he was being the biggest bitch ever and he was an hour and a half late to the club and no I'm not going to get over it because you suck you made me wait at the bar for an hour and a half for you and ugly old people were hitting on me and therefore you should be punished and I'm going to berate you to this forever and F you for getting drunk and
8658789	8660830	Grabbing my ass, you faggot.
8662491	8664893	Alright, let's move on, that's it.
8666894	8668575	Uh, Bradley, do you have a mic over there?
8670797	8671937	Brad or Bradley, somebody.
8674679	8675599	Bradley's trying to get a mic.
8678621	8682804	Uh... Fuck you to... Dial-up?
8683665	8683965	Fuck you.
8690852	8693953	The Bad Room is back with a pH 4.
8694573	8699474	Oh, fuck you too.
8700154	8701614	Not having any money.
8701634	8702754	Hello, very well.
8702814	8708396	I'm looking to sell stuff, but actually that's part of the good thing to sell stuff because I got too much crap as it is.
8708476	8710536	I don't have to look at or use.
8710696	8712336	So I'm going to get rid of some of this.
8713977	8715797	Uh, fuck you to truck drivers.
8715837	8716817	Think they own the road.
8717517	8718378	Get up behind you.
8719718	8720338	Thanks, that's the old
8720785	8729707	can drive faster up through the person in front of you if they just ride your ass and find things behind you, find keys behind you.
8730707	8731707	Uh, let's see, what else?
8731807	8732347	Anything else?
8733228	8736588	Uh, fuck you, they don't have any chips to eat.
8736868	8741049	I forgot to buy them, and fuck you for getting to buy apple juice.
8741069	8743890	So I can have something to drink in the morning other than water.
8743990	8746811	Or something that's hot.
8748191	8748531	Whatever.
8763150	8764671	All right, let's move on to Brad.
8764711	8766132	What's your FUs for today, Brad?

8783217	8783497	Okay.
8783537	8785618	Just fuck you to Stouffer's meals, because they suck.
8786078	8787698	Even though I haven't had one in a long time.
8788738	8791419	Stouffer's, like, TV dinner type things, they suck.
8791859	8797020	Especially compared to, like, Mary Colander's, which is... They're on sale, like, three out of every four weeks.
8797881	8799141	And are generally pretty good.
8800041	8808023	And, like, twice as good, twice, three times as good as those crappy pieces of shit that Stouffer's tries to pawn off on people.
8808618	8809939	for three, four bucks.
8811020	8812401	Fuck you and your shitty meals.
8812501	8814462	Okay, that was stupid.
8815543	8816764	I'm in the bedroom.
8816964	8817365	It's all good.

8898521	8900501	I don't know, it's just a thought.
8901562	8902422	I'm not always bitch.
8902442	8903882	I haven't been bitching today.
8903902	8905203	I've been good.
8905503	8907003	You've been pretty good, I'll give you that.

8914305	8915906	I bought actual rice today.
8916266	8920167	So there, for all those people that said I cook with minute rice, you can suck it.

8960814	8962835	F you to being too broke to see Kill Bill again.

9011160	9013160	Damn, that just sucks.
9013381	9014201	Oh my god.
9015023	9021906	You know, next thing, I'm a bitch if I was having too much money, because, you know, whoo!
9022626	9027048	And she liked to agree, hee-hee, dirty ball-licking truck drivers, damn.
9028189	9029809	She was agreeing with a previous FU.
9032151	9038833	Nostylan says, my FU is for not having any Let the Hit Them Remix Ferret Remix.

9054411	9055471	They're all dead!
9055511	9059474	And Bradley is sitting in Jamie's hiding blue chair, so what can you do?
9060754	9061875	I'm boring anyway on the cam.

9112993	9118376	Cough, cough Oh man Alright, we're going to take a quick break and we'll come back
9119592	9123996	I'm going to talk about some things that you can do to help Bomani out.
9124316	9128299	There's a few things that you can still do right now to help the Bomani scene out a little bit if you want to.
9130721	9131622	Do this or die.
9133463	9135725	And we'll maybe do some Ask Orange Lounge.
9136066	9141590	So if you have a question for Ask Orange Lounge, remember DarkSakura's not here tonight, so she can't answer your questions.
9141650	9143111	If you have a question for her, it's going to have to wait.
9143131	9147915	But if you have something me, Loki, Brad, or Bradley could answer, hey, we'd love to help you out.
9147995	9148816	Send on a question.
9149514	9150914	and we'll do the best we can.
9151835	9152215	Why?
9152455	9159656	In the meantime, let's hear, I want to hear something from Beatmania Core Mix, I think.
9159696	9161577	Let's hear Emotion, the romantic style.
9162017	9162897	No, we don't want to hear that.
9162937	9163437	Yes, we do.
9165018	9167138	It was originally in Beatmania Core Mix, though.
9167218	9167658	That's where it is.
9167758	9169059	I know, but that was also in Night Style.
9169079	9169479	Well, you know what?
9169499	9169939	I don't care.
9170679	9173680	I want to hear the Yodeler remix of the DJ Battle.
9174260	9174800	Okay, fine.
9174820	9176580	We'll hear the Yodeler remix of the DJ Battle.
9176700	9177441	That's really annoying.
9177781	9178141	Fine.
9178701	9179121	Actually, I have a
9180638	9182499	Do you really think that you can scratch, Will?
9182519	9185000	Well, if you keep up with my scratch technique, I'll accept you.
9185020	9185281	Right.
9185301	9185701	Get ready.
9239238	9242542	Alright, I'll consider your talent.
9242562	9245065	Look, the dance floor is waiting for you to start.
9245125	9247448	If you keep up with my crack techniques, I'll accept you.
9247528	9248128	Alright, get ready.
9283757	9285639	Yes, that's a great place.
9286179	9288782	Look, the dance floor is waiting for you to start.
9291424	9292705	Christ, that song is annoying.
9292805	9298711	Oh well, since we put the F-U in fun, here you go.
9401255	9404138	Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami.
9404158	9409923	I know you all know Beat Media, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.
9410584	9413146	Listen carefully and try to follow.
9414067	9417670	The objects will come down from the top when it hits the red line.
9423217	9424379	Turn the table!
9424961	9425742	You get it?
9426103	9427867	Alright, let's practice!
9429109	9431093	First, hit the white keys!
9460227	9461010	Thank you for watching!
9495068	9497449	It's hard, but you can do it!
9497469	9499911	Okay, let's exercise!
9500111	9501992	Here's the spec of the new Pikminya!
9554236	9555036	Thank you for watching!
9584495	9585536	Thank you for watching!
9605987	9607748	Bitch, get a new song.
9608388	9610870	An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
9611210	9612931	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
9613491	9615072	We're going to do Ask Orange Lounge here in a little bit.
9615112	9619114	We got a ton of freaking questions tonight, so we're going to address all your questions.
9620024	9625630	But first off, I just wanted to say, before the break, I said that there's stuff you can do to help Bomani out right now.
9625710	9627091	There's a couple things.
9627171	9636941	First off, 2DX Consumer Style, the new one, at last count, they have about almost just shy of 9,000 responses.
9637201	9637782	And they only need 10,000.
9638342	9641826	So in the next nine days, they're going to need 1,000 more responses.
9641926	9643748	So if we can, you know...
9645151	9649552	If all the listeners can get in on that, then we'll have it down to a good 998.
9649692	9653594	I think it's five days from now, like the 24th.
9654414	9654654	Is it?
9655034	9655934	I think it's the 24th.
9655954	9658155	Whatever, I did my math wrong, so whatever.
9659315	9663357	So there's not a lot of time left, so get your ass over to KonamiStyle and sign that.
9663677	9668558	I don't have a direct URL for it, sorry guys, but maybe somebody in the chat room will be kind enough to post one.
9668638	9671339	DarkSakura probably has more than there was like a week, five days ago.
9675877	9679058	There's a direct link on Bomani Style somewhere, so look for that.
9679118	9690921	Speaking of Bomani Style, the other thing I was going to say is that they are going to be distributing TAC's new CD, Bounce Connected, but they need to get, I think, about 200 orders for it, and they only have about 75 right now, I think, when I did the math.
9691281	9691461	Was it...
9692938	9695760	Oh, I thought it was 25 paid and then 50 reserved.
9696120	9697641	I thought it was plus 75.
9698282	9702565	But still, if you guys are interested in picking up Bounce Connected, head on to Bomani Style.
9702605	9705026	It's right on the top of their page in the bottom left.
9705326	9708629	And tell them Orange Lounge Radio sent you so they'll think we're cool.
9709449	9716330	And also, after they get Bounce Connected ordered up, they're going to order more CDs from diverse systems.
9716871	9720451	One of the CDs called Hello Boss features P8107.
9721151	9732414	So, you know, that's definitely a CD you're going to want to check out because it's got a ton of awesome remixes by the Japanese artists who are a lot better at remixing Bomani music than the American artists will ever be.
9733114	9733594	So, ha!
9733674	9734214	Eat that!
9735094	9738075	And yes, I do admit they are way better than I am, so...
9742295	9744036	Alright, so that's what you can do to help Bomani out.
9744076	9745996	Let's do some Ask Orange Lounge.
9751899	9753180	Let's Ask Orange Lounge.
9753740	9754901	Some stupid question.
9755581	9757722	Baba, I'm not singing because I'm sick, so fuck off.
9757842	9758142	Alright.
9759323	9762544	Ask some questions.
9762564	9763365	You want to sing, Bradley?
9763405	9763865	Go for it.
9765125	9766806	Alright.
9766826	9768247	ViolentHyperGirl would like to know,
9769744	9776670	My friend Danny, who said Loki bitches too much, wants to know why you guys don't have better quality radio.
9777931	9779372	I don't know if he means sound-wise.
9779412	9782415	If you're talking about sound quality, that's because we're staying modem-friendly.
9783176	9786879	We want modem listeners to be able to access our station because they've supported us since the beginning.
9788260	9794145	But next month, we're going to go MP3 Pro, which means even if you're on a modem, you can still get DSL-quality sound.
9794165	9794846	That's going to be exciting.
9795509	9797330	You know, I forgot to mention something about FUs.
9797470	9806733	I know this is totally, like, past that segment, but FUs to that stupid Modesto Mitsubishi commercial that lasted a good half hour.
9807833	9810094	You suck, and that crazy Mexican guy's funny.
9810874	9812815	And that put that segue into this.
9813255	9820098	This is why we don't put quality radio out there, because irritating radio stays with you longer than, you know, quality radio.
9820738	9821878	Quality radio gets forgotten.
9822038	9823759	Irritating radio stays with you.
9826027	9826808	I just took a piss.
9828189	9828629	Thank you.
9831151	9835394	Um, if you don't like our station, I challenge you to do something better.
9837075	9837316	Alright.
9837336	9838797	Or the easy way, just fuck yourself.
9842119	9845422	But I know that's not what you meant, so hugs and kisses from you to me.
9846042	9846603	Or from me to you.
9847223	9849365	Hold on, who was the one who had the question?
9849745	9850946	Uh, one of ViolentHyperGirl's friends.
9851606	9851707	Oh.
9852347	9854789	Sorry I don't know you, I don't want to be mean or anything, but fuck yourself.
9857719	9860280	My other friend wants to know the purpose of Orange Lounge Radio.
9860320	9864202	The purpose of Orange Lounge Radio is so that we can make asses of ourselves on the internet.
9866463	9868884	Yeah, it's to entertain ourselves and not you, so fuck off.
9871326	9871966	Just kidding.
9872246	9873587	Nothing but love for all you.
9874647	9875528	Especially new people.
9878910	9883312	ViolentHapperGirl also wants to know, when will the next mass Orange Lounge Radio or GB?
9883372	9885173	And if it's happening soon, will you need my whip?
9885956	9886957	I don't know and yes.
9887297	9888918	Probably whenever the next big tournament is.
9889138	9891460	Although not that one the day after Halloween because I'll be out of town.
9891500	9892601	So no orgies without me.
9894082	9894382	Alright.
9896964	9897465	Moving on.
9898025	9899506	DarkSakura sent in a question.
9901328	9901828	Here we go.
9902148	9906091	DarkSakura wants to know, Dear Orange Lounge, why is DarkSakura so fucking rad?
9907952	9909574	Because she's a chick that plays video games.
9912315	9913036	Sky, do you enjoy saying my nick?
9913096	9913636	You always seem to...
9932162	9932803	It's 915 and 72 degrees.
9947256	9948216	In the Sacramento area
9980327	9984009	Nins would also like to know, Tuesday is coming, did you bring your coat?
9986750	9987910	It's from Rejected.
9988691	9989031	Anyway.
9989851	9992853	Tee hee, Tee hee hee, Rejected joke.
9993793	10001737	Hello and welcome to last week.
10001897	10005078	23rd Magus would like to know, where can I find a good international lawyer?
10005499	10008540	I need to crack down on these illegal Portuguese joke book makers.
10011849	10012489	Moving on!
10013289	10013550	Huh?
10014070	10017731	Yeah, the dead silence reflects everyone everywhere in the response to that segment.
10018171	10019491	Oh, I totally wasn't paying attention.
10020552	10025273	The Orange Lounge Madam, Pixie Dust, or Penée Princess, as she'd like to be called tonight.
10025733	10027494	Okay, here's a real question for Loki.
10027514	10028054	It's not Penée.
10029015	10034019	P9 I like saying PNA because it sounds like TNA, which is what Pixie Dust makes me think of.
10035821	10036622	Here's a question.
10037222	10041446	Why does Loki make fun of the fact that my FU goes to me having big tits?
10041806	10044969	You try having big boobs for a week and see how cheap you feel.
10049693	10051415	I don't even know how to respond to this.
10051775	10053337	What are you talking about?
10053357	10054458	He has big boobs.
10056004	10057125	He has big man boobs.
10057405	10062291	I have nice sized breasts, but those are all my girlfriends, so you know.
10062591	10063412	Oh, there you go.
10064213	10064733	There you go.
10065674	10066795	I don't feel cheap at all.
10067616	10067936	Alright.
10069518	10073142	You know what I say is, use what you got.
10074835	10077778	I'm going back to some violent hypergirl questions here because she said a bunch.
10078738	10081981	Can you put the Camel Toe song back in circulation on Orange Lounge Radio?
10082522	10082742	No.
10083202	10089007	But you might hear it on one of the spinoff shows, Vanilla Sky, Monday nights at 7 o'clock.
10089288	10092450	Or pump up the volume, Jamie's spinoff show, Tuesday nights at 7.30.
10092611	10099076	And if you get really lucky and you give him head, you might hear it on Loki's show, Live Wire, coming back in November on Wednesdays.
10100497	10100938	Right, Loki?
10102025	10103025	That's a pretty good one.
10103065	10103766	I'll tell Nelly.
10104386	10106647	The other question is... Damn you!
10107147	10110808	You're never here, so... Her friend wants to know, why am I so violent?
10111629	10112729	Because it's ViolentHyperGirl.
10113069	10115190	I would say it's all that pent-up sexual energy.
10118451	10119732	But you know that can be fixed.
10120312	10124134	Pent-up sexual energy should be unleashed on the masses.
10126567	10127548	Pip has a question.
10127608	10129888	Pip would like to know, what homepads do you guys use?
10131749	10148313	I have an ignition that I kind of got out of a relationship because my ex has been too lazy to pick it up and I guess doesn't really want to talk to me, so I get an ignition pad out of it, I guess, and I got 2DX 3rd and 4th style out of it.
10148333	10149094	It's not a bad deal.
10151201	10165031	but the ignition pad's on loan to Jamie right now so what Loki's putting on our webcam right now are the metal pads he just built and those are the new home pads of choice here also, and somebody else asked this question too where is the ferret right now?
10165191	10172536	I want to see him on the webcam, please um, the ferrets died sorry oh yeah, where are the ferrets?
10172596	10180622	the ferrets are hiding hey one of those is mine I have custody of one of them they're dead they're all dead
10181769	10182850	My Tom Cruise impersonation.
10183671	10184493	Goddamn ferret.
10189499	10192082	That is all you'll hear on this show because Jamie's not here.
10194005	10195186	Yo, they wanted to see it on the cam.
10195206	10195967	Can you put it on the cam?
10197409	10197649	Alright.
10200482	10203685	Kamasaki wants to know, so I've always wanted to ask you guys this.
10204426	10211473	If you were called Orange Lounge Radio, why don't you just play Orange Lounge Tomosuke songs all day, aside from the fact that they'd repeat after an hour or so?
10212033	10215477	Well, you hit on the first point, it would get pretty old pretty fast.
10215877	10216738	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10237288	10263926	And Wet Pussy Radio was already taken, so We couldn't use that one either Such a bummer And because that's what we picked, so fucking clear your mind I know, I wanted to be Wet Pussy Radio really bad But unfortunately it was taken But for the record, we do play like every single Orange Lounge and Tomosuke song They're all in rotation, because Orange Lounge kicks ass And Tomosuke kicks ass Alright, Tomosuke Tomosuke Wasabi Wasabi
10265543	10265963	Moving on.
10266644	10271327	John Fields wants to know, Loki, what's your sim file number at now?
10272467	10275749	I don't know because I actually haven't played Step Mania in like months.
10275890	10277971	So I have tons of them sitting on my hard drive.
10278011	10279512	I just haven't gotten there.
10279532	10280933	Probably up to 4,000 now.
10282774	10284075	Bubble Bath Phase Radio.
10284175	10284775	Sweet.
10285796	10286716	That game sucks.
10287117	10290279	It would be better if it was Gal's Panic Radio.
10292280	10292880	Alright.
10292980	10293881	Go check out
10295143	10296965	Sexy Pachinko Reaction.
10297525	10300648	That game is the best freaking hentai arcade game I've ever seen in my life.

10307253	10308654	Can I get to the rest of the questions, please?
10308674	10312337	We all know Sammy, the company responsible for... Come on, anybody?
10312417	10315439	NoStylin wants to know... You faggot.

10322372	10324793	When will there be a Loki remix of Mr. Ferrets?
10327834	10328514	There's your answer.
10328754	10330035	When I change my name to Twen?
10333816	10334196	Zing.
10335237	10339658	NoStylen also wants to know, How many listeners do you have listening to Orange Lounge Radio right now?
10340658	10341159	Two and a half.
10342059	10342459	Two and a half.
10343099	10343579	You're the half.
10344260	10346480	How come 23rd Magus has bad jokes?
10347321	10347581	Well...
10348575	10349396	Thank you for watching!
10367102	10367922	and WellEducated.
10369263	10370924	DarkSakura has another question.
10371544	10375046	Dear Orange Lounge, where the fuck did all two generals go on Ragnarok?
10375126	10376667	I want to gain another fucking level.
10377487	10380809	I'd answer that, but I haven't played Ragnarok in about, oh, three months.
10382730	10384691	In fact, does anybody in this room play Ragnarok anymore?
10385491	10386272	Never have, never will.
10386292	10386732	Show of hands.
10386872	10389813	I would be if I had money, but I have no money.
10389953	10390714	Guess you're fucked.
10390774	10391334	Sorry, Jamie.
10391394	10393795	Not only are you sick, but we can't answer your question.
10393875	10395136	Boy, are you screwed tonight.
10395176	10395516	Love ya.
10396697	10396857	What?
10398456	10399736	Where are the generals in Ragnarok?
10402017	10402397	I don't know.
10404898	10406178	Rob is a fart smeller.
10406338	10406839	No, I'm not.
10407419	10408479	Don't read what chatroom says.
10408499	10409339	You're one fart smeller.
10409359	10410600	They spread evil rumors about us.
10411700	10414061	Have you guys been to that store, Fart and Smile?
10415541	10415681	No.
10417202	10421723	Baka wants to know, why is DarkSakura so cool?
10421763	10423244	We already answered that question.
10423364	10424724	It's not my fault if you weren't listening.
10424744	10425304	She's boss.
10425384	10427365	Because she asked the question herself.
10428658	10431259	She's far out in a way cool way, man.
10432060	10433000	She's super rad.
10433461	10436022	What was the Brady Bunch thing?
10437283	10440425	You just did like a square thing with your fingers when you said she's totally not square.
10440465	10441225	That was pretty geeky.
10441405	10444247	But it was kind of rounded because I didn't make a square right.
10445007	10447548	It was more of a rectangular rounded shape.
10448269	10449610	Maybe some sort of oval.
10451391	10454792	She's like She's like Coolsville, daddy-o.
10455473	10455853	Alright.
10456854	10457374	Moving on.
10458945	10459965	I'm hip to that jive.
10460005	10463106	Biohazard asked about 20 questions, so I'm saving him for last.
10465627	10471888	Pixie Dust wants to know, Sky, what would you do if you had a cute gay guy, a popsicle, and a lot of time in a bedroom?
10474209	10476370	I'd eat the popsicle, then suck his dick, come on!
10479110	10481051	Fuck him in the ass, then wipe your dick on his curtains.
10487313	10491015	What possessed you guys to start a radio station in the first place?
10491035	10493236	Were you high on pot or were you just drunk?
10493256	10493776	A little bit of both.
10493796	10497357	Actually, I had already been doing radio through my buddy's radio station, Under Sedation Live.
10511967	10514768	I'd been studying radio in college, so it was nothing new to me.
10516448	10522749	DarkSakura had been guesting on Understation Live.
10522769	10525630	She did a good job when she did it, so I said, Hey, Jamie, why don't we do a show?
10525670	10526230	She said, Sure!
10526810	10529571	And then Loki just started showing up, but it's worked out nice.
10531411	10532031	I was there.
10532231	10535372	Loki just kind of showed up, and it worked.
10538877	10543322	Yes, and Jamie would like to add she was also the most frequent guest on Understation Live, which is true.
10544884	10545184	All right.
10546125	10549729	Biohazard also wants to know, where can I find remixes of Bomani stuff?
10550710	10551751	I'll let Loki answer that.
10552191	10553092	The internet.
10554254	10555175	You want to be more specific?
10557697	10559900	Check out, well...
10561075	10564418	Check out Bomani Sims if you want shit.
10565219	10568001	Go to Diverse Systems' website.
10568081	10570903	They have a lot of samples you can find.
10571383	10575907	I believe it's diverse.co.jp, if I remember correctly.
10576327	10579369	If not, just check the link on Bomani Cell.
10579389	10583753	There should be a link to their site, because they're the ones that do Bounce Connected CD.
10584890	10604479	So find their site and look for the artist names on there and then when you see the artist names like Onokin for instance, just search under like Yahoo or something for Onokin then BMS because all the people that do remixes on there, they make BMS files for the Beatmania Sims and they do awesome remixes on there.
10604499	10612003	That's how I found P8107 without buying the CD is I just ripped the sound from the BMS file, so...
10613283	10614223	That's a good place to look.
10614924	10616904	Just search for Bomani remixes.
10616944	10628507	You'll also find there's a site that does a compendium of every single remix ever made, and they have it organized by song that's remixed from, and you can find links on there too, so just check that out.
10628807	10630208	You can find them on my hard drive.
10630248	10634629	I've got about over 100 of them, quite a big collection of official ones, but you're not going to have them.
10634669	10635629	Here's my clever answer.
10635729	10637310	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because we play them.
10639639	10643782	All right, Biohazard also wants to know, why do you keep saying you are going to burn the ferrets and you don't?
10643842	10647244	Are you not able to bring yourself to set aflame the Orange Lounge Radio mascot?
10648245	10652388	Basically, if I burn the ferrets, Jamie would kick my ass, and I know this.
10652768	10656310	But I'm hoping when she goes away to Alabama, she'll be gone for a good two weeks.
10656350	10660833	So if I set them on fire just before she leaves, she'll have the whole trip to kind of calm down.
10660873	10662654	And I'm hoping she'll forget by the time she gets back.
10662735	10664035	So have a nice trip, Jamie.
10664476	10667938	Also because one of them isn't yours, and so you don't want to burn other people's stuff.
10668659	10672262	I would just say, you know, I'm sorry, I thought you had fire insurance.
10676026	10678548	For the good of all radio, I will set it on fire.
10678849	10681471	Fire, flammable retardant or whatever.
10681952	10683053	I'm tired.
10683533	10684934	Next question, Ask Orange Lounge.
10684954	10686296	We're going to finish this up and then end the show.
10686516	10686876	Please do.
10686896	10690420	We've got to zip through these because there's only like one minute supposedly left in the show.
10693216	10699583	Why did the chicken, no wait, where did you get that Mobomoga remix you hear in the Orange Lounge Radio intro?
10699663	10703988	This is what's interesting about it.
10705409	10706651	You can't find it anywhere.
10707598	10710540	This 19 seconds that you're hearing right now is all that exists.
10710820	10712741	There is no full remix of the song.
10712781	10713822	Here's the way the story goes.
10714722	10722426	One of our frequent guests that we've had on the show in the past, Navi, his friend, I can't remember his name that he goes by online.
10722446	10724287	It's like the Great Hamster or something like that?
10724828	10728730	Well, his name, but it's the Hamster... Hamster... Hamster Alliance.
10728890	10730671	Hamster Alliance is what he goes by online.
10731351	10732012	He just...
10732831	10737754	Navi was urging him to create a Bomani remix for a Bomani Styles remix contest they had a while back.
10738214	10741296	And he doesn't really like many Bomani songs, so it was a problem.
10741316	10743637	Mogamoga is probably his favorite song out of all of them.
10744318	10747339	And he pretty much remixed those 20 seconds and then said, Ah, fuck it!
10747640	10751162	Which is too bad, because if he had remixed the whole thing... Best remix I've ever heard.
10751222	10752562	He probably would have won the whole damn thing.
10752602	10755024	If he would have remixed more Bomani stuff, he'd have more open mind to it.
10756085	10757606	Thank you for watching!
10774249	10785856	But the nice thing is, I asked him when he didn't end up entering it in the contest, but I heard it anyway, I asked him, I'm like, hey, I run a station called Orange Lounge Radio with some friends, you know, maybe we could use that?
10785916	10786597	He's like, yeah, sure.
10786997	10787977	So, there you go.
10788017	10790599	Just that whatever, how many, 15 seconds you brought of it?
10791380	10794802	Like, just that 15 seconds is already the best remix I've ever heard.
10794942	10795142	Ever.
10797663	10798124	Uh-huh.
10798204	10798824	It's so good.
10798884	10801486	It sounds like Crystal Method remixed it.
10801506	10802947	That's why I like it.
10803027	10803367	All right.
10804045	10807887	We're running a little over here, but I want to address the rest of these questions.
10808027	10813191	Anybody have info on the StepMania SM Max 4 theme that I haven't heard about for a long time?
10813611	10816873	I'll defer that to Loki, because he's the StepMania expert around here.
10816893	10818674	I don't know.
10818694	10819875	I haven't heard anything about it.
10820335	10820515	All right.
10821004	10821664	Don't really care.
10821724	10824045	They have a good one, though, that supposedly it's pretty good.
10824225	10825725	It's Transmakina.
10826605	10829166	That's out right now.
10829246	10831887	Just look for that on their skinning thread on there.
10832407	10838188	But if you want information on that, Max, just look at the skinning thread because it would be there if it was anything important.
10842429	10842729	All right.
10844190	10846570	Two more here.
10846610	10850011	Why does the webcam face a very uninteresting area of your living room?
10850683	10851984	Well, you know what?
10852244	10853205	There is no interesting area.
10853225	10854806	Surprise, there is no interesting area.
10854966	10856407	I know, so what do you expect?
10857468	10859709	You could open the fridge and get the camera in the fridge.
10860190	10860790	That would be cool.
10861130	10861651	That would be cool.
10861671	10863352	That would be cool.
10867372	10868632	Alright, last question.
10868712	10872473	Sorry guys that sent their questions in late, but we're running over here.
10872553	10876594	Biohazard wants to know, why did you pick Live365 to host your station and not some other place?
10877854	10889177	Basically because Live365 will pay all the licensing for you as well, and although I would be willing to run a shoutcast station, it's just not possible because of our bandwidth.
10889657	10895618	Believe it or not, we have too many listeners, and we wouldn't be able to maintain the bandwidth for the live show.
10896318	10897119	We wouldn't be able to do it.
10897999	10900881	So, sorry, we're kind of stuck with Live365.
10900921	10916629	Although, honestly, they're not bad, because they, you know, despite you guys get pop-up ads and all that stuff, considering everything you get, which is licensed, paid-for radio, if you want to blame somebody for the fact that Live365 has to have all these pop-ups, blame the RIAA for enacting those licensing laws and all that shit.
10917089	10919210	That's whose fault it is, not Live365.
10919230	10921711	They do the best they can, and I've been happy with them thus far.
10921751	10925053	And another idea, fucking, fucking, go download Mia...
10925504	10928706	M-E-A-Y-A pop-up ad blocker.
10931528	10933549	And you won't have any more stupid pop-ups.
10933569	10934029	There you go.
10935070	10938012	And the camera picture makes me look like a torso-less freak.
10938632	10938953	All right.
10938973	10940514	Thanks to all you guys for submitting questions.
10940614	10941934	God, we had a lot of them tonight.
10942995	10943575	Jeez Louise.
10943596	10947738	We should do more questions after the... Well, we'll see.
10951320	10951601	Yeah.
10952001	10952581	Rebirth.
10953502	10953802	All right.
10956127	10957627	That's it for Ask Orange Lounge.
10963869	10969271	All right.
10969411	10970991	Time's for everybody's final thoughts.
10971011	10972612	This is time to wrap up the damn show.
10975152	10976613	Brad, your final thought.
10977073	10978453	He said pizza looks so good.
10981114	10982734	That was before my final thought.
10982774	10984715	My other final thought is you smell like butt.
10988851	10989211	Bradley.
10991572	10993173	Gotta get up, gotta get moving.
10995313	10997654	You sound like an 80s theme song right there, thank you.
10999315	10999755	Uh, Loki.
11002576	11009699	Um, I know I have to drink Theraflute, but, like, lemon tastes like ass, so that sucks.
11010419	11016421	But I'm gonna drink it anyways, because I found out if you drink it with salt, salt is good, and it cuts the sour.
11020124	11021645	Jamie sends along a final thought.
11022606	11025128	She says, God damn, there went my lung.
11026088	11027249	And she hacks up the other one.
11027389	11028610	Thank you for that lovely imagery.
11030672	11033674	My final thought is, fuck being sick.
11033814	11034795	I hate being sick.
11034935	11037397	You suck, Mother Nature, and bite me.
11038413	11038813	That's it.
11039233	11041614	Thank you everybody for listening and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

11056441	11057161	Thanks for your support.
11057562	11058462	We always appreciate it.
11058602	11059583	Final word of the show.
11060083	11061323	Loki, I don't think you've ever had it.
11061463	11061944	What do you want?
11062004	11062764	Final word of the show.
11064545	11064945	Suck.
11067521	11069923	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
11070363	11074286	Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
11074666	11076527	We expect you a nice play again.
11076987	11079789	And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
11080310	11090877	Well, as Megatron has, how shall we say, departed, I nominate myself as the new leader.
11090977	11092978	Wait, the Constructicons formed?
11093158	11095120	Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.
