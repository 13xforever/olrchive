WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

00:17.520 --> 00:22.760
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Mommy Talk and then some.

00:22.760 --> 00:26.040
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

00:26.040 --> 00:30.040
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

00:30.040 --> 00:36.040
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

00:36.040 --> 00:40.040
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.040
Yes, I will spank your child.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.040
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

00:49.040 --> 00:51.040
Well, here's to my big opening.

00:51.040 --> 00:53.040
A sphincter says why?

00:53.040 --> 00:55.040
I'm super. Thanks for asking.

00:55.040 --> 00:57.340
You little bitch troll from hell.

00:57.340 --> 00:58.540
What am I doing here?

00:58.540 --> 00:59.040
Haha!

00:59.040 --> 01:01.040
Nooooooo!

01:01.040 --> 01:02.040
Dodge this.

01:02.040 --> 01:03.040
Mm-hmm.

01:03.040 --> 01:05.040
This is a tasty burger.

01:05.040 --> 01:07.540
Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left!

01:07.540 --> 01:08.540
It's a house?

01:08.540 --> 01:09.540
Look!

01:09.540 --> 01:10.540
It's a flesh wound.

01:10.540 --> 01:17.540
Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a polyshore.

01:17.540 --> 01:19.040
Oh, yeah?

01:19.040 --> 01:22.540
Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

01:22.540 --> 01:23.540
Dark Sakura.

01:23.540 --> 01:30.220
I had a sniff, sky, but I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer, Loki, I hate you,

01:30.220 --> 01:41.220
Orange Lounge Radio, we are live, this is episode number 65, for October the 19th, live 65,

01:41.220 --> 01:49.460
of 2003, if you thought last week was a blah show, just wait for tonight, you're tuned

01:49.460 --> 01:52.620
into the bee money scenes

01:52.620 --> 01:58.060
most sick radio station of all things bee money

01:58.060 --> 02:00.780
the whole damn world is sick today

02:00.780 --> 02:05.060
well you're always sick but I mean like physically ill

02:05.060 --> 02:08.500
not mentally ill I'm both I'm physically mentally

02:08.500 --> 02:11.700
and I'm sick and abusive

02:11.700 --> 02:15.740
I'm past the contagious stage I'm fine

02:15.740 --> 02:22.740
p0k3smot42o1 my name is rob roberts view you might know me as sky

02:28.300 --> 02:31.780
joining me as always are half of my awesome co-hosts

02:31.780 --> 02:33.980
in this empty corner

02:33.980 --> 02:38.360
the sickest bunny on the farm is jamie summers you know her better is dark sakura

02:38.360 --> 02:39.900
is out sick today

02:39.900 --> 02:42.800
i had a sniff

02:42.800 --> 02:44.440
now you tell me

02:44.440 --> 02:45.440
Hold on.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.440
I'm going to stop this for a minute.

02:46.440 --> 02:57.400
You tell me if both me, Loki, and Jamie are all sick, what does that tell you?

02:57.400 --> 02:59.200
Somebody here last Sunday was sick.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.480
That's what I'm trying to get at.

03:00.480 --> 03:04.480
I don't know, but I have a feeling you guys are all having sex.

03:04.480 --> 03:05.480
That's why you're all getting sick.

03:05.480 --> 03:12.120
Well, it could be that there's a cold going around anyways, and more than one time people

03:12.120 --> 03:16.420
have it because there are people in my work that had it before me. So, it's obviously

03:16.420 --> 03:19.780
not just one person. It can be totally unrelated.

03:19.780 --> 03:22.180
Especially when you work at a large place like you do.

03:22.180 --> 03:26.560
Or it could be, you know, what the most obvious answer is. It's a government conspiracy to

03:26.560 --> 03:35.080
shut us down. They have had bioterrorists come in and, you know, poison our food supply.

03:35.080 --> 03:42.080
Thank God I ate it all and um, yeah, we don't have a lot of time left.

03:42.080 --> 03:49.080
Alright, um, oh hey, knock on the door, yay, another well person.

03:49.080 --> 03:55.680
Hey, now we can get him sick, yeah, we can get him sick too, alright, let me uh, let

03:55.680 --> 03:58.200
me finish the intro here.

03:58.200 --> 04:04.920
See, she got sick from work, so, nyeh.

04:04.920 --> 04:11.920
Well, you should have stopped it!

04:11.920 --> 04:14.880
Oh shit.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.240
Alright, well...

04:17.240 --> 04:20.160
Alright, alright, alright.

04:20.160 --> 04:24.600
Just forget the intro.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.600
Forget it.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.960
Forget it.

04:28.960 --> 04:34.440
Alright, so Jamie's not here, but she is in the chat room, so if you want to say hello

04:34.440 --> 04:37.560
Hello and wish her to get better soon.

04:37.560 --> 04:38.560
Our mics are too loud?

04:38.560 --> 04:39.560
I turned them down.

04:39.560 --> 04:40.560
Are they too loud?

04:40.560 --> 04:41.560
I turned them down.

04:41.560 --> 04:42.560
Oh, they're too loud!

04:42.560 --> 04:43.560
Stop it.

04:43.560 --> 04:44.560
Sorry.

04:44.560 --> 04:45.560
Thank you for that.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.680
I haven't even introduced everyone yet.

04:47.680 --> 04:48.680
I think they all know.

04:48.680 --> 04:49.680
Ah, well.

04:49.680 --> 04:50.680
We've got to do the introduction.

04:50.680 --> 04:51.680
Okay, let's do the introduction.

04:51.680 --> 04:55.400
Okay, Jamie's out sick, but she's in our chat room, www.calibomani.com, click on Orange

04:55.400 --> 04:56.480
Lounge and click on chat.

04:56.480 --> 05:02.320
Say hello, wish her to get better soon, and watch her berate you over typing instead of

05:02.320 --> 05:03.560
verbally tonight.

05:03.560 --> 05:04.560
Alright.

05:04.560 --> 05:05.560
Okay.

05:05.560 --> 05:10.320
In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

05:10.320 --> 05:16.780
Hello again.

05:16.780 --> 05:19.720
Not only are we sick, but we're bitchy and irritable.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.840
How is it any different than usual?

05:21.840 --> 05:24.920
He said hello.

05:24.920 --> 05:25.960
He did, kind of.

05:25.960 --> 05:30.680
Also with us tonight, filling in because he's so generous for the lack of a third person

05:30.680 --> 05:31.680
tonight.

05:31.680 --> 05:32.680
Say hello to Lanky Style.

05:32.680 --> 05:33.680
Also known as Brad.

05:33.680 --> 05:34.680
Hello, Lankystein.

05:34.680 --> 05:36.680
Also known as Brad.

05:36.680 --> 05:39.680
And then in that corner, say hello to Brad Lee.

05:39.680 --> 05:42.680
And also known as Arcadia42.

05:42.680 --> 05:46.680
Oh, no.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.680
How are you doing, Bradley?

05:47.680 --> 05:48.680
OK.

05:48.680 --> 05:49.680
Good.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.680
Usually we'd still have music playing right now, but I fucked up.

05:51.680 --> 05:52.680
He can talk.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.680
He can sing.

05:53.680 --> 05:54.680
Wait, I think I can get music back now.

05:54.680 --> 05:55.680
Hold on.

05:55.680 --> 05:56.680
Hold on.

05:56.680 --> 06:00.680
Yes, there we go.

06:00.680 --> 06:05.680
We'll be talking to all of them more a bit later, but first, we're going to take a quick break.

06:05.680 --> 06:10.680
Don't do that. Don't do that, stupid wacky DJ stuff.

06:11.680 --> 06:16.680
I honestly don't know how we're going to make it three hours tonight. I really don't.

06:15.680 --> 06:20.680
Toki says he's got the ideas.

06:17.680 --> 06:22.680
I think I'm just going to turn this show over to Brad.

06:20.680 --> 06:25.680
What? Which one? Bradley? Okay, here, Bradley.

06:22.680 --> 06:27.680
Both of you.

06:23.680 --> 06:28.680
Come here.

06:28.680 --> 06:33.680
Just sit there and smoke all night and get the sound effects of cigarettes burning.

06:33.680 --> 06:36.680
Hooray.

06:36.680 --> 06:38.680
Oh, Loki wants to take the show outside.

06:38.680 --> 06:39.680
Are you threatening me?

06:39.680 --> 06:40.680
No, we can't go outside.

06:40.680 --> 06:42.680
Then we won't get the outdoors sick.

06:42.680 --> 06:46.680
We'll get kicked out of the apartment complex.

06:46.680 --> 06:47.680
All right, we'll be back.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.680
We've got the money news.

06:49.680 --> 06:50.680
How was your week?

06:50.680 --> 06:51.680
How was your day?

06:51.680 --> 06:54.680
Cage match, FUs, all that fun stuff coming up.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.680
We'll be back.

06:56.680 --> 07:04.680
Will I ever love you again?

07:04.680 --> 07:11.680
Will we be together again?

07:11.680 --> 07:18.680
Thought the love we had was strong

07:18.680 --> 07:25.680
Tell me what's wrong, where did we go wrong?

07:48.680 --> 08:12.880
Will I, will I, will I Will I, will I, will I

08:12.880 --> 08:20.880
Will we be together again?

08:20.880 --> 08:26.880
Thought the one we had was strong

08:26.880 --> 08:30.880
And tell me what's wrong

08:30.880 --> 08:34.880
Where did we go wrong?

08:47.880 --> 08:51.880
You've got your finger on the trigger

08:51.880 --> 08:55.880
Are you gonna shoot me down?

08:55.880 --> 08:58.880
You put the wallet in the chamber

08:58.880 --> 09:02.880
But this time I'm gonna hit the ground

09:02.880 --> 09:06.880
All I wanted was a lover

09:06.880 --> 09:10.880
Someone who could hold me close

09:10.880 --> 09:14.880
Now you've gone and found another

09:14.880 --> 09:17.880
Blow my heart away

09:17.880 --> 09:21.880
Blow my heart away, blow my heart away

09:21.880 --> 09:25.880
You gotta blow my heart away

09:25.880 --> 09:33.880
Blow my heart away, blow my heart away You've gotta blow my heart away

09:33.880 --> 09:41.880
Now you've got me where you want me I've cut my back against the wall

09:41.880 --> 09:49.880
You stand here with a smoking gun This time I'm heading for a fall

09:49.880 --> 09:56.880
You've got your finger on the trigger Are you gonna shoot me down?

09:56.880 --> 10:04.880
All I wanted was a lover Someone who could hold me close

10:04.880 --> 10:12.880
Now you've gone and found another And blown my heart away

10:12.880 --> 10:16.880
Go far away, go far away

10:16.880 --> 10:23.680
Hey!

11:16.880 --> 11:18.880
Give me ecstasy

11:46.880 --> 11:54.260
Mwah.

11:54.260 --> 12:00.040
Mwah.

12:00.040 --> 12:04.640
Mwah.

12:04.640 --> 12:10.140
Mwah.

12:10.140 --> 12:16.280
S catalyst.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.280
Yeah.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.280
Oh, ass!

12:18.280 --> 12:24.560
This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

12:24.560 --> 12:28.760
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, all ye faithful listeners.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.280
You know what's funny?

12:30.280 --> 12:33.600
During that break, I'd say, you know what's funny?

12:33.600 --> 12:37.480
I looked at the numbers of how many people are listening to the station as we were on

12:37.480 --> 12:43.000
break, and I'd say about 15% of them dropped, because they probably heard that intro where

12:43.000 --> 12:47.240
We're just like we're sick, and we don't give a fuck today, and they're probably just like fuck it

12:47.440 --> 12:49.700
It's gonna be one of those shows fuck it

12:50.160 --> 12:53.560
So thank you guys for sticking on board ye faithful ones

12:53.720 --> 12:59.960
That or just live 365 servers drop them or they're just hardcore Jamie fans, and they're pissed that she's not here tonight

12:59.960 --> 13:02.760
I don't know that too, but we will most likely that's what it is

13:02.760 --> 13:07.680
There's going to be a special appearance by Jamie in one way or another we're trying to work something out because she's in the chat room

13:07.960 --> 13:11.480
She's cammy. How do you have a special appearance? I had to jump through the matrix

13:11.480 --> 13:13.480
Yeah, something like that.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.480
We'll see if we can arrange something later.

13:15.480 --> 13:19.480
We'll see if we can arrange a special visit by a sick Jamie.

13:19.480 --> 13:24.480
And when she's sick, she's twice as bitchy, so if we can get her in for the FUs, that'll be great.

13:26.480 --> 13:28.480
So, anyway...

13:28.480 --> 13:30.480
Are we doing any work?

13:30.480 --> 13:33.480
No, it won't require you doing any work. You're fine.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.480
Because you're sick too, Loki, and I don't want you to have to do work.

13:37.480 --> 13:38.480
I'm not that sick.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.480
Oh, you're not that sick? Oh, great.

13:40.480 --> 13:43.480
Why don't you do the show while I go take a nap?

13:43.480 --> 13:46.480
You sick bastards.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.480
That's right, I don't get to take a nap because I was playing video games all day.

13:48.480 --> 13:50.480
I was playing Final Fantasy X all day long.

13:50.480 --> 13:51.480
Whoop-de-freakin'-doo.

13:51.480 --> 13:52.480
Whoop-de-freakin'-doo, I know.

13:52.480 --> 13:55.480
Good for you, Wrenple, who have American PS2s and can play that game.

13:55.480 --> 13:58.480
For those of you who don't follow along or...

13:58.480 --> 13:59.480
I don't know if I've talked about it on Orange House Radio.

13:59.480 --> 14:07.480
I know I've talked about this plenty on Vanilla Sky on the Monday night show, but I've been rekindling my interest in Final Fantasy X lately.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.480
I don't know, I'm about a year and a half late.

14:09.480 --> 14:15.480
But for some reason I decided I wanted to play it and beat it, so that's what I'm doing right now, is I'm working my way through it.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.480
Someday I should go ahead and beat Final Fantasy IX.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.480
I never beat IX and I never beat VIII.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.480
We probably should tackle that someday.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.480
One of these days.

14:24.480 --> 14:32.480
It's like the last Final Fantasy I actually had the patience to beat was VII, and VIII turned me off to Final Fantasy so bad that I didn't even buy IX.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.480
But you didn't even go to Sea Spirits within, did you?

14:34.480 --> 14:38.480
No, I went to Sea Spirits within, and it made me even sadder.

14:38.480 --> 14:45.480
So, on that note, let's play How Was Your Week and How Was Your Day?

15:08.480 --> 15:14.080
Sacramento, and I don't like the fact that jury duty is in downtown Sacramento.

15:14.080 --> 15:19.520
And the whole week sucked, it was hell, and it would be nice to say, oh well you know,

15:19.520 --> 15:23.680
jury duty is done, so I get to go back to my work, but no, I have to go for the next

15:23.680 --> 15:25.400
least two days.

15:25.400 --> 15:33.700
So that sucks, and I don't want to be there, but I got to sit through it and do my quote

15:33.700 --> 15:35.700
civil duty

15:35.700 --> 15:37.700
civic duty

15:37.700 --> 15:39.700
I don't give a crap

15:39.700 --> 15:41.700
Think of the car, Honda

15:41.700 --> 15:44.700
So, you know, that's why I gotta do that

15:44.700 --> 15:46.700
it wasn't my week, it sucked

15:46.700 --> 15:49.700
I had the worst day ever on Wednesday, I just didn't care when I got back

15:49.700 --> 15:53.700
and then Thursday was alright because we got off at noon

15:53.700 --> 15:55.700
because they're still picking the jury

15:55.700 --> 15:57.700
because it's slow

15:57.700 --> 15:59.700
and then, um

15:59.700 --> 16:01.700
yeah, none of those other things

16:01.700 --> 16:05.700
They didn't say, sorry, go home?

16:05.700 --> 16:07.700
No, they actually put me on there.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.700
Wow, I got kicked off when I was a kid.

16:10.700 --> 16:14.700
Well, they still have to go through pretty much the way I figured, because I've never

16:14.700 --> 16:15.700
really been in one of these things.

16:15.700 --> 16:20.700
They've got 27 people they pick first, they go in there, and then they kind of go through

16:20.700 --> 16:29.700
and eliminate people until those 27 people are all gone or either in the jury box.

16:29.700 --> 16:34.740
There's like still another, you know, they've only eliminated like four people so far and

16:34.740 --> 16:38.860
there's still like another 13 people in the audience still or whatever.

16:38.860 --> 16:39.860
Geez.

16:39.860 --> 16:45.620
You know, and so, I mean, there's a chance that, you know, I might get kicked off, but

16:45.620 --> 16:48.420
probably not because my luck never runs away.

16:48.420 --> 16:49.420
That's crazy.

16:49.420 --> 16:50.420
So.

16:50.420 --> 16:52.680
Four people a day.

16:52.680 --> 16:59.300
It's supposed to only take two hours and it's taken like three so far over the course of

16:59.300 --> 17:03.840
a few days, actually more than three, because we had to, let's see, they were doing it for

17:03.840 --> 17:12.520
about a day or so on Wednesday. They were doing it for about an hour, because we got

17:12.520 --> 17:19.580
in there really late in the day. So they were doing it for about an hour, and then on Thursday

17:19.580 --> 17:27.340
they did it from 9.30 to 12. And they still haven't eliminated how the people, because

17:27.340 --> 17:54.780
Didn't you mention when you were on the stand or whatever that you actually did a show called

17:54.780 --> 18:00.520
Orange Lounge Radio that you are a part of? Yes. Great. The government knows about us.

18:00.520 --> 18:04.740
We are fucked. I don't think they care. Oh my God, you said that. It was funny though

18:04.740 --> 18:12.860
because the prosecution, or no, the defense attorney asked me as one of the questions,

18:12.860 --> 18:16.740
because they are pulling you and asking questions when you are on the box, because I was talking

18:16.740 --> 18:20.740
about, they are all, so what kind of music do you guys play? I am like, I play like trance,

18:20.740 --> 18:24.180
dance music, J-pop, and just went down a whole list.

18:24.180 --> 18:26.340
And then the next question was, what's J-pop?

18:26.340 --> 18:30.420
And I responded, I'm like, it's kind of like hyper, very

18:30.420 --> 18:34.540
high energy, kind of annoying.

18:34.540 --> 18:35.860
And that got everyone laughing.

18:35.860 --> 18:37.540
That was funny.

18:37.540 --> 18:40.620
So you said you were actually on a, did you say you had talk

18:40.620 --> 18:41.900
radio on the microphone radio?

18:41.900 --> 18:45.060
Yeah, and I think I would take that as, OK, we shouldn't have

18:45.060 --> 18:46.980
them on the jury, because you might go ahead talking about

18:46.980 --> 18:47.180
the thing.

18:47.180 --> 18:49.100
Well, I mentioned it as a talk radio station.

18:49.100 --> 18:55.100
I also, what was it, I mentioned, I was going into it, I guess I went into it a little too much, because the judge is like,

18:55.100 --> 18:58.100
Did you want to give out your URL while you're at it?

19:01.100 --> 19:02.100
Did you?

19:02.100 --> 19:03.100
No.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.100
Damn it!

19:04.100 --> 19:07.100
Holy shit, that would have been great.

19:07.100 --> 19:15.100
No, but, damn it, why didn't you have the business cards? We have the business cards, you could offer the judge a business card, you would have gotten kicked off the jury right there, come on.

19:15.100 --> 19:19.100
And he would have had our URL.

19:19.100 --> 19:22.100
No, I'd rather not.

19:22.100 --> 19:26.100
But anyways, the defense attorney, though, she knew what we were talking about.

19:26.100 --> 19:30.100
She's like, oh, so what kind of video games do you guys talk about?

19:30.100 --> 19:31.100
I'm like, oh, mostly the music games.

19:31.100 --> 19:34.100
She's like, oh, like that game where you step on the arrows?

19:34.100 --> 19:35.100
Wait, wait.

19:35.100 --> 19:36.100
I just have to ask real fast.

19:36.100 --> 19:39.100
Did you have to define what speed music was?

19:39.100 --> 19:41.100
No, I did not.

19:41.100 --> 19:44.100
It's a bunch of crap.

19:44.100 --> 20:03.540
Which is ironic because that's the company that my very first website was hosted on.

20:03.540 --> 20:06.540
Well, I gave them the URL to listen to us, but...

20:06.540 --> 20:08.540
Ah, see, you didn't give out the URL.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.540
It's a web person.

20:10.540 --> 20:15.540
I didn't give it out to the whole jury because half of those people I don't think know what a computer is.

20:15.540 --> 20:18.540
Were you being interviewed in front of the other jury members that were going to be interviewed?

20:18.540 --> 20:19.540
Oh yeah, the whole people.

20:19.540 --> 20:20.540
How many people were there?

20:20.540 --> 20:21.540
I don't know, 27.

20:21.540 --> 20:22.540
That's all?

20:22.540 --> 20:37.540
Well, not including the attorneys, the defense, the defendant, and all the judge, the bailiff.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.540
So basically you have no shame.

20:39.540 --> 20:40.540
No.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.540
I couldn't get up on the stand and say that I do those things. Sorry.

20:43.540 --> 20:50.540
I'd so be ashamed of this because they come on here and they find out what a big fag I am in like 15 seconds.

20:50.540 --> 20:52.540
I don't know, for some reason-

20:52.540 --> 20:54.540
Wait, did they kick you off the jury for being a homosexual?

20:54.540 --> 20:56.540
No.

20:56.540 --> 20:59.540
Maybe if the case has something to do with that.

20:59.540 --> 21:05.540
Usually they'll pick a jury when they ask you questions and they're looking for things that may give you a biased opinion during the jury.

21:05.540 --> 21:07.540
But here's the thing though, it's like-

21:07.540 --> 21:12.540
I don't understand about much- I don't know much about how the jury system works and everything, but

21:12.540 --> 21:17.540
it was like they were almost telling people what their answers are.

21:17.540 --> 21:23.740
are. Would this make you biased in any way? And it's basically like, unless I sat there

21:23.740 --> 21:29.380
and go, yes, yes, yes, yes, pretty much asking, hey, who wants to leave? It's pretty much

21:29.380 --> 21:33.940
like that. And they would keep asking the same question until they finally said no.

21:33.940 --> 21:38.180
It's because they can't lead the witnesses in the case, so they just lead the jury members

21:38.180 --> 21:47.180
to pick the ones they want. It's a very slow process, very slow. And I hope that God, it

21:47.180 --> 21:53.120
I know that we actually start the trial on Monday because, I mean, first off, Wednesday

21:53.120 --> 21:54.120
was boring as hell.

21:54.120 --> 21:56.820
You go in and you have to wait for a trial to open up.

21:56.820 --> 21:57.820
So we got one.

21:57.820 --> 22:01.540
I was the first one called or I was in the first group called for a trial.

22:01.540 --> 22:05.560
I was like, oh, sweet, you know, because we're getting to a trial, get it going, get the

22:05.560 --> 22:07.700
hell out of here, you know.

22:07.700 --> 22:10.220
No, wait for an hour, hour, they settled.

22:10.220 --> 22:15.040
Okay, so we go back into the stupid room watching Fox News all day.

22:15.040 --> 22:19.640
And so, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, lunch comes, waiting, waiting, waiting,

22:19.640 --> 22:20.640
waiting.

22:20.640 --> 22:21.640
It's almost time to go home.

22:21.640 --> 22:22.640
It's 3 o'clock.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.480
We get to leave at 3.30 if we're not called in and we're done.

22:25.480 --> 22:26.480
We're done for good.

22:26.480 --> 22:32.200
So, as you would know, at 3.15, they call in the last group and my name is the last

22:32.200 --> 22:34.120
one called on that group.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.520
So, it's like, fuck.

22:35.520 --> 22:39.640
I'm like, okay, settle, settle, settle, settle, no.

22:39.640 --> 22:43.880
I hope you get sequestered.

22:43.880 --> 22:47.200
That would be funny.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.320
It's not going to happen.

22:49.320 --> 22:51.900
I don't think so.

22:51.900 --> 22:56.800
What little I did find out about what's going on, it's not that big deal.

22:56.800 --> 23:02.160
Well, I mean, to somebody it's a big deal, but it's not going to be on the news or anything.

23:02.160 --> 23:05.760
We're not talking like a high profile case, it's just, eh.

23:05.760 --> 23:09.760
Well yeah, you would have been able to tail as soon as you went in there.

23:09.760 --> 23:12.760
They have a completely different type of process and they do that kind of thing.

23:12.760 --> 23:14.760
I don't know, I just want to be out of there.

23:14.760 --> 23:18.760
You know, it's not a matter of like, I don't like jury duty, it's fine.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.760
I just really hate downtown SAC.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.760
I hate driving down there.

23:22.760 --> 23:25.760
I honestly, I hate everything about downtown SAC.

23:25.760 --> 23:28.760
It is impossible to find any place to eat down by the jury place.

23:28.760 --> 23:32.760
I walked around blocks just looking for a restaurant.

23:32.760 --> 23:33.760
It just sucks.

23:33.760 --> 23:40.760
And then, you know, in fact, I have to get there two hours early in order to get parking space, you know, a free parking space.

23:40.760 --> 23:43.760
Otherwise, I have to pay $6 a day, you know, for parking.

23:43.760 --> 23:44.760
Yeah, for parking?

23:44.760 --> 23:45.760
No, they don't.

23:45.760 --> 23:49.760
Yeah, way to go to the city of Sacramento, you rock.

23:49.760 --> 23:57.760
You know, not only do you pay me only $15 to go to jury duty, but half that money is going to go to parking because you don't provide enough parking.

23:57.760 --> 23:59.760
How fucking lame.

23:59.760 --> 24:02.760
But it'll all be over soon.

24:32.760 --> 24:34.800
I'm on vacation next week.

24:34.800 --> 24:37.520
No, I'd be like, my work's not going to pay me.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.040
You find out what the case is about,

24:39.040 --> 24:41.840
and then you make the most stupid statement

24:41.840 --> 24:43.440
that make them totally think that you'd

24:43.440 --> 24:45.840
be the wrong person to pick.

24:45.840 --> 24:50.560
Say it's about a gay person being beaten up,

24:50.560 --> 24:54.120
then you say that you're a freaking anti-gay.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.360
It doesn't work that way.

24:55.360 --> 24:57.280
It doesn't work that way, because they tell you

24:57.280 --> 24:59.480
from the beginning what the case is going to be about.

24:59.480 --> 25:09.480
It's really the whole system is flawed the way they do it, but I guess it works because they have so many trials a day.

25:09.480 --> 25:21.480
It doesn't make any sense because any idiot can find a way out of it. It's just on the honor system, which isn't worth much nowadays.

25:21.480 --> 25:25.340
I don't know how, I guess I was just too young because I think I got called in like on my

25:25.340 --> 25:26.340
18th birthday.

25:26.340 --> 25:31.180
I mean, I swear it was like as soon as I could go to jury duty, I was called and they were

25:31.180 --> 25:33.980
just like, I think they just thought I was too young and they sent me home.

25:33.980 --> 25:34.980
I was like, thank goodness.

25:34.980 --> 25:35.980
I don't want to be here.

25:35.980 --> 25:41.180
Well, it's like there are people like they're all, I don't even know how they could have

25:41.180 --> 25:42.180
a hardship.

25:42.180 --> 25:46.500
You know, the trials going to like last like two days, you know, once they get the jury

25:46.500 --> 25:50.300
selected and you're like, oh, poor me, poor me.

25:50.300 --> 25:54.980
I'm not going to have enough money to make rent, because I missed two days of work.

25:54.980 --> 25:56.980
Well, that's kind of how it is for some people.

25:56.980 --> 25:57.980
Oh, well.

25:57.980 --> 26:04.020
I mean, and you miss rent, and you fucking, it could script your life, I mean, it's not

26:04.020 --> 26:05.020
just any laughing matter.

26:05.020 --> 26:11.940
I think it's a bunch of bullshit, the way they have us set up, so anyway.

26:11.940 --> 26:15.140
Rice Princess is suggesting if you wanted to get out of jury duty, you could have told

26:15.140 --> 26:22.740
them that you make sweet love to sheep. That doesn't have anything to do with the trial

26:22.740 --> 26:27.380
though, so that wouldn't work. Yeah, how would they ever find a juror in Chico if that's

26:27.380 --> 26:31.560
the case? That's what I want to know. Anyway, anything else you want to say about your day

26:31.560 --> 26:39.320
and your week? No, I really didn't do much. I just was like so preoccupied with the stupid

26:39.320 --> 26:45.840
jury crap that's like, didn't really have a very good week and didn't get any work done

26:45.840 --> 26:52.360
on my cabinet, which kind of sucks. I thought it was going to rain today when I looked outside,

26:52.360 --> 26:59.080
but according to the weather, it's not going to rain for a while. And I don't know. It's

26:59.080 --> 27:04.360
just supposed to get warmer. It's supposed to be like 90s. Ew. But I don't know. I'm

27:04.360 --> 27:14.360
I'm just pretty much just doing like running around stuff today. I went grocery shopping because I needed to do that and that's about it.

27:14.360 --> 27:19.360
Supposed to try to find a Halloween costume because I had to go to a party. I don't know, I'm good.

27:19.360 --> 27:20.360
You haven't figured out what you're dressing up as yet?

27:20.360 --> 27:27.360
I had an idea, but there's just a problem is no one seems to have the costume that I want. I had a couple ideas.

27:27.360 --> 27:31.360
It was the Mad Hatter, which is kind of cool.

27:31.360 --> 27:34.360
Just do like an evil Mad Hatter type thing.

27:34.360 --> 27:37.360
I probably do that and it's like eh.

27:37.360 --> 27:41.360
I could dress up like Neo from the Matrix because I already have a trench coat and glasses,

27:41.360 --> 27:45.360
but really it's the wrong kind of trench coat and stuff.

27:45.360 --> 27:49.360
My other one was the charred corpse of an astronaut.

27:49.360 --> 27:51.360
You are horrible.

27:51.360 --> 27:54.360
So I thought that would be kind of cool because all you have to do is find an astronaut costume.

27:54.360 --> 27:59.360
I know you'd be surprised if there's not that many out there. I guess no one wants to dress up like an astronaut this year.

27:59.360 --> 28:04.360
I hope you wouldn't be seen in public with that on because you'd get beat up by somebody.

28:04.360 --> 28:08.360
Oh, by the astronauts? Wait, they can't because they're charred corpses.

28:08.360 --> 28:13.360
You're horrible.

28:13.360 --> 28:19.360
I said you should have been a princess because that would be ironic.

28:19.360 --> 28:25.960
My co-workers supposed to dress up like a dominatrix. That's kind of cool except. She doesn't she wouldn't be a good dominatrix

28:26.680 --> 28:30.280
Now how our other co-workers the slut she be a good dominatrix

28:32.440 --> 28:37.260
But that's all okay, don't give me the microphone um after comments I got it

28:37.880 --> 28:44.560
I'll I'll talk about my day in my week, but first I have to address the chat room because they're talking about me in there

28:44.560 --> 28:54.720
I look like absolute shit today and I don't even know why I'm sitting on the cam.

28:54.720 --> 28:59.120
I should take the opportunity to sit in Jamie's hidden blue chair while she's not here, but

28:59.120 --> 29:01.880
for whatever reason I'm lazy and I don't feel like getting up on the couch.

29:01.880 --> 29:08.040
And I look really ugly today because I haven't really taken a shower and my hair is like

29:08.040 --> 29:12.960
half spiked because I didn't bother to do my hair today and I look like I rolled out

29:42.960 --> 29:47.240
I know that's right. It's really too disgusting to say on that way. That's a good bread

29:48.040 --> 29:51.520
Anyway, dissing you you're not supposed to say that's good. I

29:52.720 --> 29:55.980
Just I don't want to talk about ha ha jokes on you. I don't want to go there

29:56.640 --> 29:57.960
Any why?

29:57.960 --> 29:59.760
the rest of my week

29:59.760 --> 30:01.760
Was really pretty boring

30:02.080 --> 30:07.480
Tuesday and Wednesday was DDR extreme most of the afternoon because we finally picked it up on Tuesday

30:08.360 --> 30:11.240
But we'll get we'll get into that later. We'll talk about DDR extremely

30:11.240 --> 30:21.240
Yeah, I was so bored on Thursday, I played that damn game all day, and you know what, that's the only time I'll ever play that damn game, so it was nice while it lasted.

30:22.240 --> 30:25.240
Extreme is disappointing. Very disappointing.

30:26.240 --> 30:27.240
We'll get to that later.

30:27.240 --> 30:28.240
Oh, we are?

30:28.240 --> 30:32.240
Yeah, well, we need topics to fill three hours, so let's not blow our load all at once here, please.

30:34.240 --> 30:35.240
You're a dick.

30:35.240 --> 30:40.240
Anyway, and then Thursday I started feeling sick, so I didn't really want to do shit after that,

30:40.240 --> 30:44.200
after that because Thursday I had to go run errands out in Roseville. I didn't even bother

30:44.200 --> 30:50.320
to go by Golf Land. And then, God, what the hell. I was supposed to go out.

30:50.320 --> 30:53.440
You were just being more exciting for them. I usually go out Thursday night and I didn't

30:53.440 --> 30:56.960
because I was feeling sick. You know what, I did go out last night though. I went out

30:56.960 --> 31:01.640
dancing last night. And it was kind of interesting because I was hearing all these new Bamani

31:01.640 --> 31:05.800
songs that they were playing. Like the DJ at the club last night. Oh no, I'm Friday

31:05.800 --> 31:08.920
night. Friday night. I meant Friday night, not last night.

31:08.920 --> 31:15.220
My bad. Friday night I went out and the DJ there was really, really horrible. He was

31:15.220 --> 31:21.560
mixing songs together. Not how most DJs mix songs together, how they transition one song

31:21.560 --> 31:22.560
into another.

31:22.560 --> 31:23.560
Oh, like I do.

31:23.560 --> 31:25.280
Yeah, but no, it was different.

31:25.280 --> 31:27.000
He put gravity in the background.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.440
Yeah, no, he wasn't mixing gravity in the background either. He didn't put any thought

31:31.440 --> 31:34.320
into it. He would just mix two records together on top of each other.

31:34.320 --> 31:36.320
Oh, like I do.

31:36.320 --> 31:41.320
But, like, no, what's funny is that I'm thinking about all these, like, new Bimani songs he

31:41.320 --> 31:42.320
was playing.

31:42.320 --> 31:45.760
He was playing a song that's going to be in DDRXBox, that shiny disco ball song, which

31:45.760 --> 31:47.680
I know we talked about a couple weeks ago on here.

31:47.680 --> 31:50.200
And then he was playing Sandstorm, too.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.720
And he was, like, mixing these two songs together.

31:52.720 --> 31:54.140
It really, really sucked.

31:54.140 --> 31:55.140
Like it was...

31:55.140 --> 31:58.680
Late night, disco ball.

31:58.680 --> 32:03.680
Shiny disco ball, late night, booty call.

32:03.680 --> 32:08.680
That's really awful.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.680
He was obviously new.

32:10.680 --> 32:12.680
Why don't you just let them move in the background?

32:12.680 --> 32:16.680
You could be a DJ at a gay bar so easy.

32:16.680 --> 32:18.680
Hey, what do you mean by that?

32:18.680 --> 32:21.680
I just mean, you know, because you like gay music.

32:21.680 --> 32:24.680
Hey!

32:24.680 --> 32:25.680
I'm just kidding.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.680
My music is pure hetero.

32:27.680 --> 32:29.680
You're the only straight guy I know with a Madonna vinyl.

32:29.680 --> 32:31.680
It's not a professional DJ already.

32:31.680 --> 32:34.680
I have more than one. I have like three or four of them.

32:34.680 --> 32:36.680
You're just making my point.

32:36.680 --> 32:42.680
It's the, um, my girl likes to party all the time record that really scares me.

32:42.680 --> 32:44.680
Okay, well I guess I'm guilty there.

32:44.680 --> 32:45.680
He says he's guilty there.

32:45.680 --> 32:47.680
Yeah, but that's not, that's not gay, that's just stupid.

32:47.680 --> 32:48.680
That is so gay.

32:48.680 --> 32:49.680
That's stupid.

32:49.680 --> 32:50.680
Well, apparently you didn't answer that video.

32:50.680 --> 32:51.680
Exactly.

32:51.680 --> 32:56.680
And you're gay, and you're stupid, so it works.

32:56.680 --> 33:09.680
I was hearing a ton of new Bimani songs at the club.

33:09.680 --> 33:13.220
I heard Love at First Sight, Stomp to My Beat, you know all these ones that you hear in-

33:13.220 --> 33:15.500
Well, they're not really Bimani songs.

33:15.500 --> 33:20.260
They're not, but you know, it's still neat to sit there and go, oh my god, it's in DDR!

33:20.260 --> 33:21.260
I don't know.

33:21.260 --> 33:22.260
No.

33:22.260 --> 33:23.260
It's not quite what it used to be.

33:23.260 --> 33:25.460
When he plays Max Period, I'll be like, okay.

33:25.460 --> 33:26.460
Yeah, you're right.

33:26.460 --> 33:35.800
You're never going to hear a Konami original there, but I remember when I was first getting

33:35.800 --> 33:45.120
into DDR, back when DDR USA was the only game there was to play, I remember going out to

33:45.120 --> 33:48.260
the club with a couple of Bahmani friends and we heard Stomp to My Beat and it was like

33:48.260 --> 33:49.260
yeah!

33:49.260 --> 33:53.960
Am I the only person who heard Stomp to My Beat before it came out on DVD?

33:53.960 --> 33:55.960
I had heard it before, too, but it got better.

33:55.960 --> 34:00.960
We used to listen to it all the time when we played QZAR.

34:00.960 --> 34:08.320
Yeah, I mean, they used to play it on power 105.5 here all the time, which is just a local

34:08.320 --> 34:10.960
thing to say, but I had a radio station.

34:10.960 --> 34:14.000
There was a radio station that used to play dance music, and it was big before DDR was

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
around.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
It was awesome.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
And too bad the damn station isn't around anymore.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.280
It was the best station this town ever had.

34:18.280 --> 34:19.960
No, it's power 105.5 the fish.

34:19.960 --> 34:22.560
No, it's power 105.5 the fish.

34:22.560 --> 34:26.960
But it used to be Car 105, and they would play all this really good dance music, and

34:26.960 --> 34:32.400
like, I bet you anything, in fact, I'm almost positive, I am like, that I heard Do It All

34:32.400 --> 34:36.280
Night by Erotic on that station, before I ever heard it in DDR, because when I heard

34:36.280 --> 34:38.560
it in DDR, I was like, I know I've heard this song somewhere before.

34:38.560 --> 34:43.880
It's possible, I mean, because they are, uh, a European, um, dance place.

34:43.880 --> 34:46.160
Anyway, hi, I'm off on a tangent, let me come back down.

34:46.160 --> 34:52.040
What you were saying is something about playing, when we go to the club, and now it's in DDR,

34:52.040 --> 34:55.440
So now we already like Stomp to My Beat, now it's a DDR, and we'd be at the club and we'd

34:55.440 --> 35:00.920
actually do the dance, like we do it where we go step, step, step, step, step, just like

35:00.920 --> 35:02.560
it was in Stomp to My Beat.

35:02.560 --> 35:07.280
Like doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, left, left, left, down, anyway.

35:07.280 --> 35:08.280
I'll shut up now.

35:08.280 --> 35:09.280
I'm leaving.

35:09.280 --> 35:10.280
No!

35:10.280 --> 35:11.280
You scare me.

35:11.280 --> 35:12.280
No!

35:12.280 --> 35:13.280
All right.

35:13.280 --> 35:15.560
So you did Riverdance, basically.

35:15.560 --> 35:19.640
Riceprincess says that the first time she heard Stomp to My Beat was when she went to

35:19.640 --> 35:20.640
go watch strippers.

35:20.640 --> 35:22.640
I don't know if that's the first.

35:22.640 --> 35:26.640
That's kind of weird, though, to have them play that in a strip club.

35:26.640 --> 35:27.640
Hey.

35:27.640 --> 35:29.640
Stomp to my be- stomp on my face.

35:29.640 --> 35:31.640
I mean, I don't get it.

35:31.640 --> 35:34.640
Sit on my face, she was sitting on my face.

35:34.640 --> 35:37.640
Okay, that was really bad.

35:37.640 --> 35:40.640
Stomp on my cock.

35:40.640 --> 35:42.640
Stomp on my cock, he says.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.640
No, thank you.

35:44.640 --> 35:49.640
I guess I'm done.

35:49.640 --> 35:56.120
I think that's it yeah oh oh Jamie's reminded me of another time we heard

35:56.120 --> 36:00.120
stomp to my beat it was when um you remember when we like the all the

36:00.120 --> 36:03.280
Sacramento people used to go to Roswell Golf Land every like Thursday night or

36:03.280 --> 36:05.920
Wednesday night it was one of the two nights we used to go here once I 30 one

36:05.920 --> 36:11.560
time we were at Brookfield's we heard stop to my beat in the kitchen and if we

36:11.560 --> 36:15.840
had it oh my god it's DDR moment all right I'll shut up now

36:15.840 --> 36:19.840
Brad! How was your day? How was your week?

36:23.840 --> 36:24.840
Really?

36:24.840 --> 36:25.840
That's pretty much it.

36:25.840 --> 36:33.840
No, uh, fuck, nothing really. I just, I've been playing PSO. I don't know why. I just had this urge to play PSO again.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.840
And not online, because I'm playing on Dreamcast.

36:35.840 --> 36:38.840
And that would be Phantasy Star Online for the uninitiated.

36:38.840 --> 36:41.840
If anybody doesn't know what PSO is, there's something wrong.

36:41.840 --> 36:51.840
That's like saying, what's Aro? What the fuck? What's EQ? What's L-O-Z? What's that?

36:51.840 --> 36:56.840
EQ. That's that magazine for men, right? Is it? I don't know.

36:56.840 --> 37:03.840
You're thinking XY. Anyway. Oh, GQ. I get it. No, so I've been playing that for some reason.

37:03.840 --> 37:08.840
I don't know. And reading Harry Potter because I'm way behind. Yes, I'm going to admit it.

37:08.840 --> 37:16.520
I read Harry Potter, I am hooked on the Harry Potter books, I'm a little late, but hey,

37:16.520 --> 37:17.520
they're good.

37:17.520 --> 37:20.920
You have a weak mind, you've been sucked into the Harry Potter books.

37:20.920 --> 37:22.920
They're actually very good books.

37:22.920 --> 37:23.920
No, I know.

37:23.920 --> 37:24.920
I know.

37:24.920 --> 37:30.080
Okay, I remember when the first book came out and hardly anybody knew about the book.

37:30.080 --> 37:33.480
Only my friend's little brother was reading it and it started to get bigger and bigger

37:33.480 --> 37:35.360
and I was like, what is this thing?

37:35.360 --> 37:41.100
Then he had this Harry Potter birthday party where all of his friends decorated the house

37:41.100 --> 37:44.120
like a Hogwarts, if you know what that is.

37:44.120 --> 37:48.040
I'm pretty sure most people know because it's in the movie.

37:48.040 --> 37:49.320
And I was just like, what is this?

37:49.320 --> 37:50.320
This is so stupid.

37:50.320 --> 37:53.840
And then by the time I know it, everybody's reading it and I'm still skeptic about it

37:53.840 --> 37:57.080
and the fourth book is out and I'm just like, whatever.

37:57.080 --> 38:03.160
And then Jamie, thank you Jamie, she buys, Irene and I, the box set of the four books,

38:03.160 --> 38:06.920
That fifth book hadn't come out yet, and we had watched the first movie, and I really

38:06.920 --> 38:07.920
liked it.

38:07.920 --> 38:11.960
We watched the second movie, and I finally got around to reading the books, and the books

38:11.960 --> 38:14.440
are so not kids' books.

38:14.440 --> 38:19.040
They're geared towards kids, but I think there's a lot of things in the books that kids wouldn't

38:19.040 --> 38:20.040
even understand.

38:20.040 --> 38:25.360
Really, some of it's pretty complicated, so good stuff.

38:25.360 --> 38:27.280
No, there's no hardcore sex, Loki.

38:27.280 --> 38:28.680
I'm not reading that.

38:28.680 --> 38:29.680
Well, actually, I don't know.

38:29.680 --> 38:31.640
I haven't gotten all the way through the fourth book yet.

38:31.640 --> 38:33.640
I'm thinking of Harry Cooder, not Harry Potter.

38:33.640 --> 38:36.640
Harry Cooder.

38:36.640 --> 38:45.640
Yeah, I haven't gotten all the way through the fourth or fifth book, so I don't know. I can't say, but I'm sure there's a lot of people out there listening right now who have even read them all, so...

38:45.640 --> 38:47.640
Whatever. No spoilers for me.

38:47.640 --> 38:53.640
I'll just wait till the movie comes out and you can see Harry Potter having sex with Hermione while Ron sticks him up the ass.

38:53.640 --> 39:16.740
I have searched for pictures for the new movie coming out, the third movie on Harry Potter.

39:16.740 --> 39:19.840
What comes up on Google Images?

39:19.840 --> 39:28.880
Harry Potter doujinshis, which are like pornographic mangas.

39:28.880 --> 39:32.760
Maybe you spelled Harry Potter wrong.

39:32.760 --> 39:36.320
I don't even know why people bother.

39:36.320 --> 39:40.400
Look at what Mario and Luigi look like when they're having anal sex.

39:40.400 --> 39:43.040
Is that all you have to say, Brad?

39:43.040 --> 39:44.040
Yeah, pretty much.

39:44.040 --> 39:45.520
Alright, then let's ask Bradley.

39:45.520 --> 39:46.520
How was your day?

39:46.520 --> 39:47.520
How was your week?

39:47.520 --> 39:48.520
Hey!

39:48.520 --> 39:49.520
How's it going?

39:49.520 --> 39:58.980
On Monday through Wednesday I actually did some work for one place, but basically I had

39:58.980 --> 40:04.760
a big stack of papers, one was in order and one was not, so I had to take one stack and

40:04.760 --> 40:09.680
reorder it to get it ready to put with the other papers so that we could stuff it in

40:09.680 --> 40:10.680
envelopes.

40:10.680 --> 40:11.680
So you got paid to shuffle papers?

40:11.680 --> 40:15.120
Yeah, shuffle papers and throw them into envelopes.

40:15.120 --> 40:23.520
That took three days, and doing that hurts your shoulders.

40:23.520 --> 40:26.280
And that's where they had a little bit more data entry, and then that was it for that

40:26.280 --> 40:27.280
place.

40:27.280 --> 40:32.560
And then Thursday, Friday, didn't do very much.

40:32.560 --> 40:38.280
Monday my cable got cut off because I haven't paid them yet for a while, so I'm going to

40:38.280 --> 40:45.040
dial up for a while, which sucks, sucks majorly, especially if you need to have people calling

40:45.040 --> 40:50.340
sometime for maybe interviews or something, so I have to like keep it off during the day

40:50.340 --> 41:00.080
when I have to like take everything. So that's kind of a bitch. Saturday went around shopping

41:00.080 --> 41:07.280
and such. And the limited money I have. What did you buy? Oh, just some like detergent

41:07.280 --> 41:13.560
and like dishwasher. Day-to-day necessities. I know, because everybody out there listening

41:13.560 --> 41:17.560
I want to know what kind of detergent you use.

41:17.560 --> 41:18.560
Cascade.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.560
Cascade?

41:19.560 --> 41:20.560
Wait, wait, wait.

41:20.560 --> 41:21.560
For dishwasher detergent?

41:21.560 --> 41:22.560
Yeah, yeah.

41:22.560 --> 41:23.560
I have a...

41:23.560 --> 41:26.640
This will help everybody out there who has an apartment or house and actually has to

41:26.640 --> 41:34.540
do dishes, do not buy any name brand detergent for your fucking dishwasher.

41:34.540 --> 41:42.060
I found out that Walmart brand Sam's Choice detergent from Walmart is better and cheaper

41:42.060 --> 41:43.660
than any other detergents out there.

41:43.660 --> 41:45.580
And I have used pretty much every freaking kind

41:45.580 --> 41:47.100
of dishwasher detergent.

41:47.100 --> 41:49.680
I used to use Electrosol, Cascade.

41:49.680 --> 41:50.880
It would not clean anything.

41:50.880 --> 41:53.680
Even if I cleaned the dishes before I cleaned the dishes,

41:53.680 --> 41:55.280
it still did not clean them.

41:55.280 --> 41:58.060
But the Walmart, the Sam's Choice detergent

41:58.060 --> 41:59.300
fucking kicks ass.

41:59.300 --> 42:00.300
It's cheap, too.

42:00.300 --> 42:02.980
Wait, there's two hands grabbing from the mic.

42:02.980 --> 42:05.100
This is the most uninteresting topic ever,

42:05.100 --> 42:06.720
but I'm actually interested here.

42:06.720 --> 42:10.620
So you just know this based upon experience,

42:10.620 --> 42:13.740
or do you have the scientific data to back it up?

42:13.740 --> 42:18.780
I found the idea from, they did a news report on why can't they basically get, this is how

42:18.780 --> 42:21.240
boring our local news stations are.

42:21.240 --> 42:24.700
We can't figure out, they do this will it work Wednesdays thing or whatever and they

42:24.700 --> 42:28.000
try to see like which, they compare products to see if they really work well.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.620
And they were saying, you know, here's the expensive brands and they did like tests.

42:31.620 --> 42:35.100
And now I don't know if they made the fake tests or not, you know, but basically they

42:35.100 --> 42:39.940
said their opinion was to use this specific brand, this Walmart Sam's Choice brand.

42:39.940 --> 42:42.780
I mean, I don't know if they're faking the test or not, but I said, I'll give it a shot.

42:42.780 --> 42:46.360
And I have had nothing but bad results with other, I always thought it was my dishwasher

42:46.360 --> 42:48.420
that couldn't fucking wash the dishes.

42:48.420 --> 42:52.300
But no, I go, I buy the Sam's Choice stuff, and it works better than any other kind of

42:52.300 --> 42:53.940
detergent I've ever used.

42:53.940 --> 42:56.820
Probably because it has toxic substances in it, but who knows?

42:56.820 --> 42:57.820
Who cares?

42:57.820 --> 42:59.940
Yeah, go about killing the earth.

42:59.940 --> 43:03.900
Your dishes come out with a nice glow to them.

43:03.900 --> 43:04.900
Yeah.

43:04.900 --> 43:08.260
Thanks for killing the earth, Brad.

43:08.260 --> 43:09.260
I know.

43:09.260 --> 43:16.260
I am single-handedly destroying this planet, and I feel good about it.

43:16.260 --> 43:20.420
Because I can eat off a clean plate, so fuck you.

43:20.420 --> 43:22.460
Even if my turkeys grow three eyes.

43:22.460 --> 43:26.540
Wait, turkeys, I don't know, here.

43:26.540 --> 43:31.180
If turkeys are growing extra limbs, that just means more food for me.

43:31.180 --> 43:33.780
There's nothing wrong with that.

43:33.780 --> 43:37.900
Supposedly that's how KFC makes their chickens.

43:37.900 --> 43:43.380
They have like no feathers, no beaks, huge bodies and tiny little legs.

43:43.380 --> 43:46.460
KFC is doing something fucked up because we all ate there the other day and I swear to

43:46.460 --> 43:51.780
God we were all like this afterwards, we were all clutching our stomachs and going, chemical

43:51.780 --> 43:54.260
poisoning.

43:54.260 --> 43:56.060
It's not the chemical poisoning.

43:56.060 --> 44:00.620
You're merely reacting to the nice grease layer that's on the chicken to help ease its

44:00.620 --> 44:01.620
digestion.

44:01.620 --> 44:07.020
Unfortunately, a lot of our bodies aren't used to that amount of grease.

44:07.020 --> 44:12.500
So you know the fact that the chickens are mutants that might also have a fact, a factor

44:12.500 --> 44:13.500
for that.

44:13.500 --> 44:17.340
But no, I think I was sick because I was like starving, I hadn't eaten anything all day

44:17.340 --> 44:22.820
except for popcorn, a full thing of popcorn and then I had a bunch of chicken.

44:22.820 --> 44:29.700
And then later on that night, I had a really hard parmesan twist from round table that

44:29.700 --> 44:32.220
were sitting out on the counter for three days.

44:32.220 --> 44:38.160
And then after that, I'm all clenching my chest, going, why am I not feeling good?

44:38.160 --> 44:44.500
So lesson for life, kids, don't start off the day with eating a bucket of popcorn.

44:44.500 --> 44:46.940
It's never a good way to start.

44:46.940 --> 44:47.940
Yeah.

44:47.940 --> 44:53.620
Were you done talking about your day and your week, Bradley?

44:53.620 --> 44:59.140
And yeah, I didn't do all that much other than Wednesday coming over here and playing

44:59.140 --> 45:01.140
some DDR Extreme.

45:01.140 --> 45:04.160
That's right.

45:04.160 --> 45:13.180
I forgot to add one thing about my week and my day, and that is that yesterday morning

45:13.180 --> 45:15.220
I went and saw Kill Bill for the third time.

45:15.220 --> 45:16.220
Thank you.

45:16.220 --> 45:17.220
Shut up!

45:17.220 --> 45:19.220
You were with me!

45:19.220 --> 45:21.220
Screw you!

45:21.220 --> 45:24.320
I know we missed the pyramid tryouts because we had to go see Kill Bill again, so what

45:24.320 --> 45:25.320
can you do?

45:25.320 --> 45:28.780
But Kill Bill was just as good the third time, and I will be going to see it at least the

45:28.780 --> 45:32.900
a fourth time if not fifth and sixth because I'm sick.

45:32.900 --> 45:39.140
So anyway, before we get to the break, I got over the chat room a message from Jamie.

45:39.140 --> 45:41.780
She would like to share how her week and her day was.

45:41.780 --> 45:42.940
So Jamie, how was your day?

45:42.940 --> 45:44.220
How was your week?

45:44.220 --> 45:48.380
Well, Jamie says, my week equals work.

45:48.380 --> 45:50.860
My day equals suck.

45:50.860 --> 45:56.300
And no Bomani, because I'm being frugal.

45:56.300 --> 45:58.300
There you go.

45:58.300 --> 46:03.100
Alright, if no one else has anything to say for right now, we're going to take a quick

46:03.100 --> 46:06.820
break and we're going to come back and we're going to talk about DDR Extreme because we

46:06.820 --> 46:10.740
all got to play it this week and we certainly have a lot to say about it, so we'll get to

46:10.740 --> 46:11.740
that when we come back.

46:11.740 --> 46:18.260
In the meantime, enjoy this break, we'll have some Casey and the Sunshine Band from Max2USA

46:18.260 --> 46:25.260
the way to Shawn the Hornymaster. We'll be back.

46:48.260 --> 46:55.260
Make a little love, get down tonight, get down tonight

46:55.260 --> 47:03.260
Baby babe, I'll meet you at the same place, same time

47:03.260 --> 47:12.260
Where we can all get together and ease up all my love

47:42.260 --> 47:43.780
I take it

47:43.780 --> 47:46.020
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

47:46.020 --> 47:48.020
Get out, get out, get out

49:16.020 --> 49:18.020
Oh

49:46.020 --> 49:47.020
Yeah!

49:53.620 --> 49:54.620
Yeah!

50:01.420 --> 50:02.420
Yeah!

50:04.520 --> 50:06.020
I did it!

50:09.020 --> 50:10.020
I did it!

50:10.020 --> 50:12.020
I'll be there

50:12.020 --> 50:14.020
I'll be there

51:14.020 --> 51:33.900
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

51:33.900 --> 51:37.940
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

51:37.940 --> 51:43.700
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

51:43.700 --> 51:45.000
Howdy, folks.

51:45.000 --> 51:45.500
We're back.

51:45.500 --> 51:49.780
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 65,

51:49.780 --> 51:50.820
the sick episode.

51:50.820 --> 51:54.060
Because Jamie's out sick tonight.

51:54.060 --> 51:57.980
She would have tried to really just push herself.

51:57.980 --> 51:59.380
And my phone's ringing.

51:59.380 --> 52:01.220
She would have really tried to push herself

52:01.220 --> 52:01.920
and come in tonight.

52:01.920 --> 52:03.300
But the problem is then she would

52:03.300 --> 52:05.560
have been even worse off at work tomorrow.

52:05.560 --> 52:06.660
She can't really do that because she

52:06.660 --> 52:09.220
doesn't have any vacation time left because she's using it all to go to

52:09.220 --> 52:14.980
Alabama in November I think is when she's going so yeah she's gonna be gone

52:14.980 --> 52:19.180
for episode 69 that makes me sad how we're gonna have an episode 69 without

52:19.180 --> 52:22.420
Jamie I don't know but then again maybe she's maybe she planned it that way

52:22.420 --> 52:27.860
because we can get dirty here on orange long radio we can get very very dirty

52:27.860 --> 52:34.020
anyway welcome back and we were talking about how was your week how was your day

52:34.020 --> 52:38.000
before we went to break and most of us kind of had boring weeks because there's

52:38.000 --> 52:41.060
not like going on hmm there's people laughing outside I wonder what that's

52:41.060 --> 52:44.380
about I know I hear giggling maybe people are listening into the show

52:44.380 --> 52:51.180
except we're not funny so I don't know so I don't know what's going on there

52:51.180 --> 52:58.460
anyway oh oh you're looking through the peephole Loki huh what do you see are

52:58.460 --> 53:03.220
Are there naked people out there?

53:03.220 --> 53:04.220
Damn my phone.

53:04.220 --> 53:08.580
Oh, is Brad talking to the neighbors?

53:08.580 --> 53:13.780
Yeah, we have some interesting neighbors because our neighbors upstairs to the left, they're

53:13.780 --> 53:17.600
big anime fans, so they think what we do is pretty funny.

53:17.600 --> 53:23.660
They like to make fun of Loki and his DDR pads that he's building outside.

53:23.660 --> 53:25.180
What did they say something of...

53:25.180 --> 53:28.700
I was commenting to them the other day, something about how Loki's building his machine, and

53:28.700 --> 53:32.420
I commented something like, oh yeah, they asked me where are you going to put it?

53:32.420 --> 53:35.940
And I said, oh, well, Loki's going to get rid of the TV and kind of put it in its place

53:35.940 --> 53:38.740
because the cabinet's going to be a television, too.

53:38.740 --> 53:42.340
And they were just, they were kind of like, oh, there's nothing like watching Loki playing

53:42.340 --> 53:43.340
some DDR.

53:43.340 --> 53:46.980
Okay, it had to be there, never mind.

53:46.980 --> 53:53.620
Anyway, okay, as promised, I wanted to talk about DDR Extreme because it came out last

53:53.620 --> 53:57.480
Thursday, but a lot of folks in America didn't really get it till this week. You were really

53:57.480 --> 54:01.900
lucky if you got it last week, but most of us got it this week, and we've all had a chance

54:01.900 --> 54:05.680
to play it, so I'm just kind of curious what your guys' thoughts are on the game, so let's

54:05.680 --> 54:07.840
go around and see what people think. Brad?

54:07.840 --> 54:08.840
What are you talking about?

54:08.840 --> 54:09.840
Are you talking about your neighbors aren't drugs?

54:09.840 --> 54:10.840
I'm talking about the way the chat room is.

54:10.840 --> 54:19.120
Well, because I just talked to your neighbors out there.

54:19.120 --> 54:20.120
Okay.

54:20.120 --> 54:21.120
I'll tell you later.

54:21.120 --> 54:22.120
I'll talk about it later.

54:22.120 --> 54:23.120
Anyway.

54:23.120 --> 54:27.120
Extreme sucks.

54:27.120 --> 54:28.360
I didn't really care for Extreme.

54:28.360 --> 54:33.040
The last machine I was really ever excited about was Max 2.

54:33.040 --> 54:35.240
Extreme came out of the arcade and I thought it was really cool.

54:35.240 --> 54:42.740
put like sakura in there and and xenon and daikonkai and miracle moon led style like

54:42.740 --> 54:48.420
those are a few good songs but the most of the songs in the machine sucked okay now the

54:48.420 --> 54:52.480
home version comes out and i hear you know the songs that are going to be out on it the

54:52.480 --> 54:57.560
unlocks i heard them pretty much before like i got to yeah i heard them before i got to

54:57.560 --> 55:02.360
play the game i got to play the game the steps on all of them pretty much suck some people

55:02.360 --> 55:07.240
People will disagree with me saying scorching moon steps are cool, I think they're being

55:07.240 --> 55:13.640
really non-innovative with their steps still, I mean there's only so much you can do, but

55:13.640 --> 55:18.280
still they gave them all easy difficulties except for max period, but we can talk about

55:18.280 --> 55:19.280
that later.

55:19.280 --> 55:22.820
Hasn't Konami kind of been doing that with all the new songs lately, I mean people were

55:22.820 --> 55:26.580
bitching about Max 2 USA kind of had shitty steps too.

55:26.580 --> 55:30.200
Well that's because those steps are made in Hawaii I believe, Konami Hawaii makes those

55:30.200 --> 55:31.200
steps.

55:31.200 --> 55:35.320
I understand. Konami Hawaii does everything about the Xbox. This is just how I understand

55:35.320 --> 55:39.320
it. I could be wrong. From what I picked up, Konami Hawaii only does everything really

55:39.320 --> 55:42.520
into the Xbox game, and I mean everything. Konami Hawaii has completely developed the

55:42.520 --> 55:49.240
Xbox and computer versions of DDR. There's kind of a debate whether Konami USA is making

55:49.240 --> 55:53.420
those steps or Konami Japan. Some people think it's being done in the US. Some people say

55:53.420 --> 55:56.680
it's Japan. I guess people don't really know. There's a different style. There's obviously

55:56.680 --> 56:01.840
a different style to the steps on the American only songs that don't show up in other Japanese

56:01.840 --> 56:06.520
games. I can tell there's some sort of difference to them, so I'm thinking they're done by somebody

56:06.520 --> 56:15.200
else. But still the thing is, sorry, I'm getting sidetracked by some of the stuff that's being

56:15.200 --> 56:16.200
talked about.

56:16.200 --> 56:17.200
Then don't look at the chat room, look at it when you're done talking.

56:17.200 --> 56:19.880
Well, there's important stuff I want to talk about that they keep talking about.

56:19.880 --> 56:20.880
Alright.

56:20.880 --> 56:38.880
Anyway, the steps for these new unlocked songs were kind of ass. I love Scorching Moon. I pretty much like all of the unlocked songs on Xtreme except for Max Period, which leaves three songs.

56:38.880 --> 56:41.880
I'm going to do Twask or King Moon and Stupid Barber.

56:41.880 --> 56:48.880
Those were all good songs, and it was pretty much up to how the steps felt, and the steps didn't feel right.

56:48.880 --> 56:56.880
Max Period was an extreme disappointment. In my opinion, it seems like they hired Bomani Ruler to make a step file for Max Period.

56:56.880 --> 57:01.880
And they didn't. Don't start that rumor. That rumor is already going around.

57:01.880 --> 57:06.880
I know, but you look at it, and it's just like, okay, let's speed up the fucking BPM to 800 BPM or whatever it is at the very end.

57:06.880 --> 57:11.880
Wow, that's fun. I think they've totally jumped the shark.

57:11.880 --> 57:16.880
No, here's what they did. They don't really know what we want.

57:16.880 --> 57:24.880
That's why DDRXtreme was, what songs do you want? Notice all the songs that they picked, a lot of them, were sim files beforehand.

57:24.880 --> 57:38.880
So, think about it. If I'm going to find out what people want as a sim file, or not a sim file, but a steps for Max and what I want the song, I'm going to go listen to all the sim files and mix songs. Notice-

57:38.880 --> 57:44.880
Wait, wait. You're talking about Max 2 USA, not Xtreme, right? Because you're talking about like Heaven had like 50 sim files for it and then-

57:44.880 --> 57:48.880
No, no, no, no, no. I'm talking about Xtreme. We're talking Xtreme here.

57:48.880 --> 57:49.880
Okay.

57:49.880 --> 57:57.640
Because look, Colors, A, V, those all have step charts, okay? Now look at Max Period.

57:57.640 --> 58:05.380
It's basically, I could basically make that stupid song, okay? That song, it wasn't remixed

58:05.380 --> 58:14.900
at all very much. And the step charts to it, it's a bunch of jumping. It's just, it was

58:14.900 --> 58:21.460
fucking retarded. So, how are most of the max step charts in songs? They suck. So, I

58:21.460 --> 58:24.580
guess they think that we like this kind of step charts, so that's what they gave us.

58:24.580 --> 58:29.960
I really like the steps for max 300. I think those were really good for the song. Max Unlimited,

58:29.960 --> 58:34.220
pretty good. Lots of jumps, but still pretty good. And then it just started going downhill.

58:34.220 --> 58:38.980
Legend of the Max, alright, but just, I don't know, I think it should have ended there.

58:38.980 --> 58:43.580
Just with max 300 and max unlimited, and the steps just start, you know, I guess there's

58:43.580 --> 58:48.120
There's only so much they can do with the steps and before they run out of ideas.

58:48.120 --> 58:51.140
It's interesting that you guys keep saying, there's only so much they can do, there's

58:51.140 --> 58:53.780
only so much they can do, because I think they're done.

58:53.780 --> 58:59.820
Because DDR Extreme has a credits mode on it, and in this credits mode it's very epilogue-ish

58:59.820 --> 59:00.960
in the way it's presented.

59:00.960 --> 59:04.940
It kind of goes through the history of DDR, like it shows, DDR first mix was then, and

59:04.940 --> 59:08.440
DDR second mix was then, and shows little screenshots and stuff, and then they're pretty

59:08.440 --> 59:12.660
much giving you the impression that that's it, we're done, no more DDR.

59:12.660 --> 59:15.420
Although I don't think that's the case, I think DDR is going to come back, but it's

59:15.420 --> 59:21.180
going to be a different, it's going to be different, like how BeatMania 2DX is different

59:21.180 --> 59:22.180
than BeatMania.

59:22.180 --> 59:26.380
And to further reinforce that, they have, in each mix that's released, there's a master

59:26.380 --> 59:29.660
song list that includes all the songs that they're working on for other mixes that have

59:29.660 --> 59:38.500
not been released yet, and DDR Extreme has the same track list as DDR Max USA 2, which

59:38.500 --> 59:41.000
uh... pretty much it's just uh...

59:41.000 --> 59:42.120
all that's left

59:42.120 --> 59:45.520
on that song list is just the uh...

59:45.520 --> 59:48.360
ultra mix and that's it

59:48.360 --> 59:52.560
but obviously we know the european... I mean they're still developing for european

59:52.560 --> 59:53.400
market

59:53.400 --> 59:56.880
you know and they're also developing for our market so

59:56.880 --> 01:00:00.960
I mean I'm sure you'll see more stuff it's just we'll only be in the U.S.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:04.780
and we'll see once the stupid party collection comes out

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:08.980
There might be some more stuff on there, you never know.

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:12.580
Yeah, that's true, because there's still the party edition coming out.

01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:16.620
Party collection, and you never know, it might be like preview for something.

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:19.620
Although, I seem to think that party, it's kind of weird that party collection is kind of

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:23.420
coming out after DDR has kind of already had its epilogue here.

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:24.740
So I don't know what

01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:28.620
DDR party collection is going to be. I'm hoping that maybe there'll be some kind of hint

01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:32.060
I wouldn't read too much into that Cred screen, because they're just talking about what came

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.980
out so far, it's kind of like a thank you to them.

01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:38.180
I don't know about you guys, did you guys see the credits sequence at all, or did you

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:42.420
guys kind of, even from max period, even just the max period, thank you for playing the

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:45.540
way it, you know, it claps at the end and it's like a finale type thing, more of like

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:47.980
an encore kind of song.

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:48.980
I just kind of got the feeling there.

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:49.980
Then again, that song sucked.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:55.300
Yeah, it did suck, I'll give you that, but, you know, it was probably rushed.

01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:59.380
The whole thing is it comes back down to, like, you know, what they put on the stupid

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:04.540
header for Extreme. We're starting over. You don't start over if you're going to end it

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:09.740
right there. I mean, that's kind of retarded right there. I mean, obviously, they're going

01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:14.220
to do something with it. They didn't say, this is the last one. This is, you know, it

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:19.460
ends here, you know, the final revolution or something like that, you know. They would

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:22.340
definitely advertise it like that if it was the last one. I don't think they're just going

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:28.700
to be like, hey, whatever. I mean, there's still plenty of stuff that they haven't even

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:33.540
tried yet. They haven't tried like doing songs with unlocks that have to do with the e-mall

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:38.580
cards and stuff like that and I'm sure there's a new machine coming. It's just a new type

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:46.540
of machine that they're still developing that's probably a little ways away. Here's what's

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:52.380
going to be interesting is that I'm very confident that we're going to see DDR Extreme in the

01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:57.260
US, a home version of DDR Extreme. I'm very confident that we're going to have that. It's

01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:00.620
It's going to be interesting to see if the U.S. kind of treats it as a last mix or what

01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:04.780
they're going to do because as far as I can tell, DDR in the U.S. is still mega popular.

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:10.940
I mean, I was listening to Understation Live on Friday night, the radio show that I started

01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:14.620
on that's still on Live 365, if you want to catch it, I was listening to Understation

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:19.420
Live and the host there works for one of those discount stores, one of those big discount

01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:24.180
stores, and they're getting like huge shipment of dance pads in now, which shows like, well,

01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:26.780
maybe it's that, oh, the dance pads aren't selling, so they're having to be relegated

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:33.740
discount stores, but that more shows to me that DDR is everywhere. You know what I mean?

01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:37.740
It's still growing in the US from what I see.

01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:43.920
Just like always in Japanese games that are produced, directed, and created in Japan,

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:49.380
we always get them whatever the latest thing is in Japan. We get them either a few months

01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:58.060
just a year or years behind them. Even though there were American machines three years ago

01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:02.920
with the 1.5, it didn't still take off nearly as much as it's going to start with these

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:11.460
home versions. A lot of people out there see it as, oh, this is a good way to get exercise,

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:14.500
but they don't want to go up and make a fool of themselves on the American machines out

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:18.380
there in the arcades or some of the import machines. Now they're like, okay, I can buy

01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:23.180
it and play it in my own home. So it's starting to get popular, people are starting to see

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:30.220
it. I think there is still a market for DDR in America, but I don't see there being much

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:33.300
more of a market for music games in general. In the next two years, I think we're going

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:39.180
to find out where music games are going, ending, or whether or not it's going to go much longer.

01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:43.780
Because a lot of other companies are doing, Namco has a line of music games, they've got

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:48.300
Taiko no Tatsujin. There's a lot of other companies out there that are doing it.

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:55.740
Enix has been doing the Bust A Move series, even though that's pretty much done with.

01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:59.820
Music games are going to die out very soon, so it's not surprising that the latest versions

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:07.300
of DDR are kind of just sucking. I think they're going to start, you can tell by where their

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:10.640
money is going with games. The big, big titles that come on me are putting out like this

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:13.280
new castlevania obviously there

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:16.240
taking their money away from their money

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:19.760
series and they're putting it towards something else the people are going to

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:23.200
might last longer

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:26.360
uh... i think i think you're wrong on one thing i don't think the music games

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.480
are dying i think they're just uh...

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.760
they're changing

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:32.740
as the systems get bigger and better i think these games are changing to i

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:35.720
think that's what we have like this new line of games can we have the karaoke

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:36.620
revolution

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:39.200
they say karaoke is going to be the next big music game

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:44.200
Because you've got American Idol, the game as well, which isn't really karaoke, it's more crap, but whatever.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:49.200
The thing I was thinking of, though, is look at DDR itself as like an arcade machine.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:52.200
It's running on hardware that's a good ten years old, you know?

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:54.200
That's true, it's running on...

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:58.200
Well, I don't know about ten years old, but it's 98, right?

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:01.200
Yeah, 98. It's like a good six years old right now.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:06.200
It's due for an update. I mean, it's so old right now, they can't do anything else with this,

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:12.040
So they can't release another game on there because it will just be inferior.

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.640
They can't possibly do it.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:17.320
That's why they're coming up with a new hardware system for it.

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:20.740
It makes sense that they're shifting their money away from it right now and they're kind

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:24.200
of hurrying through some of these things because maybe they're just trying new stuff right

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.760
now with the hardware.

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:31.000
They're trying to squeeze a few more mixes out of the hardware before they'd have to

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.040
create something brand new and now they're just like, well, we've done all we can with

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:45.040
What I would love to see to make DDR more interactive. Love to see them bring out another like a sub stream type mix.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:51.580
But have a little more interactive. Where you got a newer version of BeatMania 2DX and a newer version of...

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:55.040
Or just whatever BeatMania mission they want to link to it. I would hope it would be 2DX.

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:59.040
With a DDR, a newer version of that. And let's say, you know, you play that...

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:03.040
Somebody is playing the 2DX, you don't HAVE to have them linked. But if you want to have them linked.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:08.040
One person on T.D.X. will be playing the song, like DJing, so you've got a more interaction.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:10.040
You've got a person who's DJing and a person who's dancing.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:20.040
Then, depending on how good the person playing T.D.X., DJing, quote unquote, is doing, it makes the actual steps in the DDR version kind of different.

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:23.040
You know, the DDR side of the machine, it makes the steps a little different.

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:27.040
Like, they're playing really good, the song sounds good, the steps start to get a little harder.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:29.040
You know, you see what I'm saying?

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:34.080
Or things like, I've heard Loki talk about this before, I think he said something like

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:39.800
Pump It Up has a thing where if you hit a certain step, it changes the way the steps

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.880
turn out in the end of the song.

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:45.520
So if you miss a certain step, it goes ahead and makes the song a little easier near the

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:46.520
end.

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.720
Whereas if you start doing really good, and you keep doing better and better, and you're

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:52.260
hitting all the steps, the song kind of morphs and it upgrades.

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:56.440
It becomes a harder song with a different type of ending.

01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:57.560
These are good ideas.

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:01.500
I think they should go ahead and look into if they want to keep their DDR series alive,

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:05.620
because that, I believe, is going to be dying soon. Of course, Karaoke Revolution is going

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:10.260
to be a big thing. It's coming out. That is their new music game that's going to probably

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:14.900
be going on for a little while, but DDR just seems like it's dying.

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:19.500
Here's the problem with the 2DX DDR idea, I think, or whatever, you know, the Substream

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:24.620
2003 or whatever you're proposing. One arcade in the whole nation would have it, and that's

01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:31.620
Not if they put in the effort to produce many of them and really advertise it and be innovative with them.

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:36.620
It would be so expensive. It would be so expensive. I don't think any...

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:41.620
The interesting thing about DDR is as expensive as it is, you can still find it at your local bowling game.

01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:48.620
Well, okay, I'm not thinking in the interest of us Americans. I'm thinking of in the Japanese market.

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:53.060
is that I'm not going to be one of those people who sits and complains, why don't we get these

01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:59.100
cool Japanese games in America? Because they're not made for us in America. The American companies

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:03.300
will want to bring them over when they think we're ready for them or if there is a market.

01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:09.060
They're made in Japan for the Japanese market. Now, on top of that, I'm thinking for their

01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:14.020
interest, they have a lot of TDR machines and a lot of GX machines in Japan. They could

01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:19.980
just have a hardware upgrade, including a network adapter, that could link these machines.

01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:25.640
Making new machines, of course, would be a hell of expensive, but the hardware upgrade

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:31.140
from 8th style to 9th style 2DX was a pretty big upgrade. It's all hard drive, it's all

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:37.820
a computer now, running an OS of, I believe, Windows XP. So they obviously can do it, and

01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:44.460
They could keep it somehow a good economic decision.

01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:47.420
I think it can be done.

01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:56.300
I heard a few years ago the rumor was that Konami has been getting some bad flak or some

01:08:56.300 --> 01:09:00.900
bad results with their music series because of all the other companies bringing out other

01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:03.940
music games.

01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:08.760
If you have to admit, after Max 2 came out, I think all the rest of their music games

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:11.660
have just been like, ugh.

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:17.140
It may just be me, but nobody I know except the hardcore players are interested in Guitar

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:20.300
Freaks and Drum Mania anymore, yet the mixes keep coming out.

01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:21.300
That's right.

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:24.300
And pop music keeps coming up.

01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:28.820
Guitar Freaks has just gotten so stagnant since 5th.

01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:33.240
When Keyboard Mania left, honestly, and it probably has nothing to do with the fact Keyboard

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:57.480
I love the game, but you have to look past the fact that you love the game and the idea

01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:00.280
of the game and look at the quality of the music on it.

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:22.280
The quality of the music has gone down since 5th Mix. There were a lot of songs on there that I would play constantly. I pretty much always had something fresh to play. But when I go and I try to play Guitar Freak's 8th Mix I think we have, there's probably like 5 songs I'll play.

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:26.080
There are some good old songs that came, but I think I played them to death, and then as

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:29.520
far as the new songs is concerned, it's just like there's not very many good new songs.

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:35.560
I was just in Milpitas Golf Land not too long ago, I was there for Chub's Birthday Party

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:40.320
a couple weeks ago, and they have Guitar Freaks, it's either 9 or 10, I don't know what it

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:44.120
was, but I walked by it at one point and it was completely empty, and I had no interest

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:47.240
in putting the dollar in and playing, even though I'd never even played it yet.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:50.240
Yeah, I haven't played it, so I think I tried it out, but still.

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:57.240
I played the Guitar Freaks 10 I think, or 9, it was, yeah, it was 9.

01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.240
I don't even know if it's 9 or 10.

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:00.240
10 just came out I think.

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:08.240
It's 10 just coming out, so it's Guitar Freaks 9. I played that at Phantom of Khan once, and I was just like, eh. After that, didn't even care.

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:17.240
Played it like maybe one or two times, and I was done. It's just like the new home versions. I play them for a day and I'm done with them.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:24.760
them. I wasted $50 on Max 2 or whatever. Max 2 was alright. It was kind of fun. I might

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:32.240
pick it up later on. But Max 2 is a Japanese one. I played it for a day. Unlocked all three

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:37.960
new songs, which was like whoop-a-dee-doo, and then I was done. I was done playing the

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:42.240
game. I just didn't care no more, because I played the rest of these songs to death

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:46.760
in the arcade?

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:53.420
I will always like Drummania because I personally love playing.

01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:55.280
The percussion is just fun.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.280
Playing drums is fun.

01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:59.680
And Drummania will always be fun even if the quality of the songs starts to go down.

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:00.680
It's still fun to play.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:04.120
But we are, in our local area, getting any new Drummania.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:09.220
And even when we have Drummania, it's broken a lot constantly.

01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:10.220
I can't speak for it.

01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:14.160
If I go down to M. Milpitas and get to play their Drummania 8th mix, then maybe I'll like

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.160
it.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:16.840
I can't really speak for it right now.

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:20.240
I hate to put you on the spot, Bradley, but I'm curious because I know you're a big fan

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:23.880
of Guitar Freaks because you're always asking me to play the music from it.

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.760
What do you think about this whole conversation?

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:34.320
Eh, well, I haven't played 9th because I haven't been to Milpitas in like six months.

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:35.320
I still like it.

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:42.920
I haven't really heard the music from 9th because I've maybe listened to it once and

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:47.480
I haven't listened to it since, so I can't really say anything about the quality, but

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.800
I still enjoy it.

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.000
That's all I can say at the moment.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.480
I have to say I am looking forward to Marmalade, Poparita Marmalade on, I think, its second

01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:59.480
to every extent.

01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:04.160
Yeah, if they're not doing any more DDR you would think all the artists that do the originals

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:08.360
DDR will now you know go to some other games and make some good originals for

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:12.560
that. I don't know of course I don't know what fucking game Soda could do so well

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:16.240
I guess he'll go to 2DX or something even although you know it's

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:24.000
debatable if 2DX has much life in it left as well so who knows who knows

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:30.280
where all that's going okay it's hard to make a prediction we'll just have to see

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:32.640
was there anything you saw in the chat room you want to comment on I know you

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:34.440
We saw some stuff earlier that made you go on.

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:35.440
It's a completely different topic.

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.440
It'd be kind of weird to change topics.

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:37.440
That's all right.

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.640
But I want to say something real quick in case your neighbors are listening now.

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:44.320
Are they really?

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:49.960
Well, your neighbors walked by and they were saying, so, do you still do the show?

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:50.960
And I said, yes.

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.520
And they asked, what is it called and how did they get to it?

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:57.960
And so I basically just said, Live 365, search for Orange Lounge and check it out because

01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:59.480
the page isn't updated really yet.

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:02.520
It needs to be updated, the web page.

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:03.520
It does need an update.

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:04.520
He's funny though.

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:05.520
He could listen to it.

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:12.620
He's got broadband, so he could listen to it, and then he could respond to something

01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:15.920
you say in the chat room, and then come running downstairs, knock on your door, and go, hey,

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:16.920
did you get that?

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:17.920
Yeah.

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:22.480
He could, theoretically, with the buffer, one of them could run downstairs, yell something

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:24.480
in the microphone, then run upstairs and hear themselves.

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:25.480
Oh, exactly.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:26.480
Exactly.

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.340
With the buffer, they could hear themselves say it.

01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:30.720
Because I think we've, I've done that in one way or another.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:33.760
I don't remember what it was, but I remember yelling something in it and then going off

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:34.760
to hear it somewhere else.

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:38.200
I think it was when we were doing a remote broadcast for one of the tournaments, or something.

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.200
That's great.

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:41.640
Well, come say hello if you're listening.

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:44.400
Yeah, if neighbors are listening, hi neighbors, sorry I forget your name.

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.400
That's my test.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.120
I want to see if they're listening.

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:48.120
Come downstairs and say something.

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:50.440
I'm afraid they would have turned it off a long time ago.

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:51.440
They probably got bored.

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:52.440
This is so boring.

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.640
A guitar freak's chat probably put him to sleep.

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.960
All right, well let's wake everybody up with some, oh no, you wanted to respond to some

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:58.960
comments in the chat room.

01:14:58.960 --> 01:14:59.960
You want to take a topic shift.

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:02.860
you want it, why don't we go to break and then we'll come back and you can do the other

01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:06.760
topic and then we'll do the cage match, because we need to get to tonight's cage match as

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:21.400
well. Okay, we'll do that. We are...oh, you see that in the chatroom right now? Oh, hey,

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:29.920
hello. There you go. I was wondering who the new people in the chatroom were. There you

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:34.880
you go. You never know who the new people are. Okay, we'll be back after this break.

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:38.960
We're going to play Jamie's. She's out tonight because she's sick, but she wanted to hear

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:43.200
some Liar Liar from Guitar Freaks 4 with all that talk about Guitar Freaks. So here it

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:44.200
is. Enjoy.

01:15:44.200 --> 01:16:08.200
I can't watch the shots each time they move right by you, so they don't show

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:28.200
Baby do you want the juice, baby do you want it

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:40.200
Yeah, drop your bar, drop out the bar Yeah, drop your bar

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:43.200
Yeah, drop your bar

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.720
Yes, you can try to find the right system

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:47.440
Now, there is a time when the streets are black and long

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:48.760
Where there's words that you can't understand

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:49.760
I'll just teach you today

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.200
So there you are, I'm a pastor

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.560
The mind can't be more than this

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.040
It's close to starting on what it takes

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:55.520
To deserve it's all we need

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:57.520
Today, what we gotta do is build momentum

01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:58.880
If we hit it right, so it's the best

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:00.520
And cry the way it's not counting the rhythm

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.120
The marks that you took, we gotta get with it

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:03.400
You made it seven, you're all mine

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.280
Are you ready to do it now?

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.080
You got the tango, so it's never ready

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.080
To take that fall

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:09.080
You ain't no cold wind from the fall

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:19.080
Yeah, yeah, drop your bar, drop your bar, let me see that bar

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:26.080
Yeah, yeah, there's still more rhythm, if you do the right tools and methods

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:29.080
Ride the waves and come to the rhythm, the march to the rhythm, then just win it

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:32.080
The pain is searing, almighty, but we can do it now, you must find your power

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:36.080
Yeah, no race to take that for, and it's up to you to hit that door

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.080
Oh

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:46.080
Orange Lounge Radio. We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:55.080
Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:59.080
You know what? That's funny because during the break the neighbors came downstairs.

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:02.080
So they weren't listening. What do you know?

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:07.080
So, um, we have to, uh, refrain from talking about how much Folsom sucks right now. No, I'm just kidding.

01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:10.080
Yeah, let's keep the language down to a minimum.

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:13.080
We don't want people getting bad opinions of the people living next door.

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:16.080
Alright. No, I'm kidding. I don't care.

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:23.080
They already know we're crazy. They see the construction work out on the patio and they know we're not well, so...

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:31.080
So, anyway, um, you wanted to talk about something else, right? You had a new topic, and then we're gonna get into this nice cage match.

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:44.080
Okay, I'm not going to be talking about condoning any kind of illegal activity, except I'm just going to say there's some skepticism about mod chips for next generation systems.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:50.080
I'm speaking specifically of Xbox, Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube.

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:54.080
I don't know anything about Xbox.

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:55.080
I don't care to.

01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:56.080
I don't like Xbox.

01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:57.080
I'm not going to talk on that.

01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:02.080
GameCube, there's no current way to copy games, so there is no reason...

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:04.080
Although, Matt thinks he heard something today.

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:05.080
Matt, what's up, Matt?

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:12.080
I read something today. I downloaded this off of Supernova.org, your wonderful BitTorrent site.

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:14.080
Anyways, it is...

01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:16.080
And let me pull this up right here.

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:21.080
Okay, it's a GameCube pack, is what I got.

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:22.080
It's a bunch of different files.

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:37.080
One of the files on there is called, it's PSUL 1.1. It's the GameCube code uploader which is basically, it runs ROM images off your PC on your GameCube.

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:40.080
What kind of ROM images? Does it need systems?

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.080
My M0GX, you know.

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:43.080
Oh, GameCube ROM images?

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:52.080
There's also a file in here where you can rip ROM straight from your GameCube using your network adapter.

01:22:52.080 --> 01:23:08.080
So basically the way it works is you have to have a copy of Phantasy Star Online, a broadband adapter, a PC to GameCube cable basically, just a network cable from your Ethernet card of course.

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:20.080
So basically you're just making a network connection from your GameCube to your PC and you just, and you run, you have to set up your computer on a certain IP, it's set to a certain IP so it can communicate with it.

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:31.080
And you set up your IP and your Phantasy Star Online thing and you basically make a connection with Phantasy Star Online and you run the program and away you go.

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:32.080
Oh my God.

01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:34.080
And there's no modding at all, you don't need to do any modding.

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:36.080
Oh my God, Nintendo we love you.

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:57.080
This has not been tested yet for us on our side, but they say it worked on there.

01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:05.080
This just means we're this much closer to finally figuring out a way to back up your games for GameCube.

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:10.080
Well, they actually have a program that supposedly does that, too. It's not really been tased.

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:25.080
Well, I've heard, because I have a cousin who's going to remain nameless, who apparently is on the top always with all the backing up of games for L systems.

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:29.600
and he told me a couple months ago that apparently there was no way to do it yet for GameCube,

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:33.280
but hey, in a couple months they may have found something out, so I don't know.

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:40.040
It's just really funny because I love watching how companies come out and say their system

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:44.800
is so secure, is full-brew, and those are the companies that are the easiest to crack.

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:50.120
Well, Nintendo's never really had a really good way to block piracy.

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:51.120
Supposedly all...

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.120
I mean...

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.120
You know what's also weird?

01:24:53.120 --> 01:25:01.120
I don't know if the GameCube is backwards compatible, but supposedly I read on one of the posts that Nintendo 64 ROM images work on there, too.

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:02.120
It's possible.

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:08.120
What are you talking about? Nintendo's always had one of the best ways to block piracy. They have cartridges. You can't copy a cartridge very easily.

01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:14.120
Actually, you can, but it's not easy. It's not as easy as putting in a PlayStation disc, click copy, done.

01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:15.120
Here's the thing, though.

01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:16.120
And having a lot of PSX.

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:20.000
It's easy in ways, but not as easy in other ways.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.840
For the N64, my cousin had this thing called the V-Doctor.

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:25.700
It was a pretty pricey drive.

01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:31.960
You stuck a CD-ROM drive underneath the N64, and it hooked up to it through this little

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:34.340
serial cable thing that was on the N64.

01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:38.840
You hooked that into your hard drive, and what you would do, or to your computer, or

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:41.600
what you could do, the reason why it had a CD-ROM drive is because you could either burn

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:47.740
an image, a CD full of ROM images from N64 games, and then put it in this little V doctor

01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:51.960
thing, this drive, and it would play the games on your N64. You just had to have this other

01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:56.360
little cartridge, it was like a blank RAM cartridge that you would plug into your N64.

01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:03.200
So, I mean, he had every freaking American and Japanese N64 game out, and even stuff

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:06.360
that hadn't come out yet, when, you know, when I went over to his place, I was like,

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:10.040
wow, how'd you do this? I mean, he was, he was doing it, he was pirating it. And even

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:25.040
In Super Nintendo, there were ROM images and emulation, and it was an arcade memory card

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:31.040
reader for a Nintendo 64. It's sold for, I believe, 99 cents.

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:34.840
NFL Blitz, I think, is the game that uses it, because Roswell Golf Land has one. I've

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:42.080
seen the Nintendo 64 memory card thing. Nobody uses that. Anyhow, my point was how it's easier

01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:45.840
in some ways is because you didn't have to mod any of the Nintendo systems. Whereas,

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:49.840
like with Sonys, you have to get inside, void your warranty, solder here, solder there with

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:54.040
this little chip you buy, and then possibly mess up your system, which I have done once

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:57.040
out of like the 30 PlayStation systems that I've modded.

01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:00.040
If I remember correctly, I think the Xbox, you don't actually have to...

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:01.040
Supposedly, yeah.

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.040
There's a software mod I think for that.

01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:04.040
There's some software.

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:09.040
Which is not surprising because you look at all the flaws in Microsoft software, so hey.

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:12.040
Okay, well you want to get back on the original topic.

01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:17.040
You want to talk about next-gen modding, which you have advised me against in the past.

01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:18.040
In the past.

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:19.040
In the past.

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:23.040
And I've always said, every time I brought this up in the past, like when PS2 first came

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:26.080
This is the current subject now, PS2.

01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:30.040
In the past I said, it's not worth your time to buy a mod

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:30.920
chip for PS2.

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:33.680
And that, when I said in the past, I mean when it came out.

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:36.920
Because they would come out with new games that would have

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:40.000
mod detection, that would have mod chip detection, that would

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.040
basically lock out the game so you couldn't play it.

01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:44.280
Or specifically, mostly that's going on for a lot of the

01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:45.760
online titles, which there isn't really

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:47.000
many for PS2, anyway.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.440
Not right now.

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:50.340
You know, there were ways of

01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:52.080
Final Fantasy XI just around the corner.

01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:52.660
Exactly.

01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:56.300
There were ways that they could combat it.

01:27:56.300 --> 01:28:00.340
My cousin bought a year ago a mod chip for his PS2.

01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:03.780
And it's not as like newly fandangled and great

01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:04.980
as the newer ones out.

01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:07.140
But it has not given him a problem since.

01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:10.700
He's been able to back up every game that's come out since

01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:12.740
and play it fine.

01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:14.140
That's a year ago.

01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:16.340
So Sony has not been, you know, and what I always

01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:20.100
had said was that, you know, wait till PS2 starts to die out.

01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:21.820
I mean, they're still making games for it,

01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:26.460
but it's not too far off that we're going to hear of the PS3 or whatever the new system's

01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:30.580
going to be. And Loki says already is. I haven't been keeping up. But my point is that...

01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:36.540
I say once it hits $99, which is pretty soon, that's when everybody had a modded PlayStation.

01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:39.540
Exactly. That's when everybody's going to have a modded PlayStation 2. Except me, I

01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:42.420
have no reason for one. I honestly have no reason to get my PlayStation 2.

01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:47.780
Here's my point, though. There's a newer mod chip called the DMS3. I think you can go to

01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:49.580
It will bring it up.

01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:53.100
This mod chip, it's just as difficult to mod your Playstation 2 as it is with any of the

01:28:53.100 --> 01:29:00.220
other PS2 mod chips, but this one has flash memory on it, and it has two BIOS flashes

01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:06.980
on it, and you can get updates, which you burn onto CDs from their site, that flash

01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:08.060
it to the newest BIOS.

01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:11.180
So say it, a new game comes out, and it detects the mod chip.

01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:15.860
You go to their newest site, they are on top of it, you download their little BIOS flash,

01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:20.340
burn it in a CD, put it in your PS2, there you go, you can play the game now. Also, because

01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:24.420
of that, there's all these other new features on the DMS3 where you can, when you're loading

01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:29.280
your PS2, you hold a button down, it sets it to turn off mod chip. So if you wanna play

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:34.020
online games, like say you actually bought a real copy of Final Fantasy 11, and it's

01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:37.620
locking you out of their online server because you have a mod chip, you hold the button down,

01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:42.020
disables your mod chip, now you can play online. This new DMS3 mod chip is the one to get,

01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:46.620
I'm telling you, it's time you can mod your freaking PS2s.

01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:50.580
I don't want people going out there saying that it's worthless, because it is, you can

01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:51.580
do it now.

01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:55.260
I mean, I don't, I mean, it's just, like I always say at the beginning.

01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:56.540
There may not be a reason to do it.

01:29:56.540 --> 01:29:57.540
For some people, there's no reason.

01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:58.540
For me, there's no reason.

01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:00.100
There is nothing left I want to play on PS2.

01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:01.100
Nothing.

01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:03.460
Well, for me, I think all that I have is Japanese.

01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:05.340
Everything I want to play is Japanese, anyway.

01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:10.100
And with, now technically with a mod chip, I can play the Japanese games, but there's

01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:11.100
just not that many.

01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:21.100
Okay, your point is taken, you know, but there's some of us untrustworthy people out there who want to play our other games, you know, and pictures of our games.

01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:26.100
You tell me how to mod my GameCube, I'm on it, because I play my GameCube more than anything else.

01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:31.100
I don't think you're ever going to need to mod your GameCube, eventually there's going to be a way around it, like Loki just said, so.

01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:32.100
Exactly.

01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:34.100
There's always going to be a way around it.

01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:38.380
this is what they all say when ps3 comes out to be online. You're gonna download your games

01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:41.780
online everything's gonna be online. You're not gonna be able to mod this shit anymore.

01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:47.480
Never gonna happen. Why say that, lovey? Cause people like to go out to a store and go buy

01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:51.900
stuff and take it home. It's a satisfaction having the case in your hand, the instruction

01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:55.820
mails and shit. Yeah, you might be able to buy stuff online. That's why online video

01:30:55.820 --> 01:30:59.900
like, you know, rental services and stuff, or online streaming video hasn't taken off

01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:05.000
in the first place because no one cares because people are, you know, stuck in the past and

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.360
they don't want to go, you know, do all this brand new downloading shit. Now that, it'll

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:16.320
be a good, you know, supplement to games but it's never going to replace games. Well, what

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:20.560
about like something like iTunes which is, you know, the way you can download music online

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:23.840
and it's, you know, they've sold what, 10 million songs today. It's the most successful

01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:29.040
online one. True, it's not nearly as big as going into the store and buying things but

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:35.040
For those people that prefer to buy their things online, they have a pretty viable option, and it's somewhat successful.

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:42.040
For people who were talking, I think Baka is saying, was it DMS3 or DMX? It's DMS3, but at DMS3.com, you can find out about it.

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:49.040
Yeah, but the thing is, though, is I don't like not buy a game because I only like a portion of the game.

01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:56.040
See, now with CDs, I may only like one song, so I'm only going to buy that one song, and if the only way I can buy that song is online,

01:31:56.040 --> 01:32:00.540
then yeah, I'm going to go ahead and do that, because there might not be a single for that.

01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:06.340
In my case, I don't buy music because it's too damn expensive and the artists mostly suck.

01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:11.840
If I want to discover new music, I'm going to go about it the illegal way and download it for free.

01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:15.840
Or, I'm going to go listen to those independent artists that don't get any coverage,

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:20.940
and those normally end up being better than the most mainstream artists anyways.

01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:28.540
So why should I spend money and pay for your product when it stinks? When it's lower quality

01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:33.500
than something I can get for free? Why should I pay for something that's not top quality

01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:37.260
when I can get top quality for free? That's what I want to know. And until you find a

01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:45.820
viable way to actually physically stop all piracy on the internet, which as much as the

01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:54.860
The RIA and MPAA want to try, they're never ever going to get close enough to stop it.

01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:59.580
They're really wasting too much money on that, but anyways, there's no reason for me to buy

01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:00.580
it.

01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:03.700
Just like iTunes, I'm not interested in it at all, because you know what?

01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:07.300
I can get it for free, so why am I going to pay a dollar a song?

01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:11.740
Sure, you know, for people that want to go ahead and do the legal route, that's cool,

01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:12.780
but I just don't really feel like it.

01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:16.380
Some people are afraid of the marketing monsters.

01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:17.060
Well, yeah.

01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:19.340
Oh, the big bad RIA is going to track us down.

01:33:19.340 --> 01:33:20.620
He goes, eh, whatever.

01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:22.460
You know, I don't listen to a lot of music

01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:23.260
in the first place.

01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:24.780
Most of the music I listen to is just

01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:27.660
the Bimani stuff and homemade remixes.

01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:30.060
I don't listen to a lot of mainstream stuff.

01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:32.500
I was hoping to save the iTunes topic for Vanilla Sky

01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:34.420
Tomorrow Night, but whatever.

01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:35.460
That's fine.

01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:37.660
On top of mainstream stuff, real quick.

01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:39.340
OK.

01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:40.140
Never mind.

01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:41.340
You might want to talk about this later.

01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:43.860
I just want to say real quick, I used iTunes this week.

01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:45.780
I downloaded it because it's new for Windows.

01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:47.860
And I bought two songs off it, just because I want to try it,

01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:48.900
see if it was good.

01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:50.380
And I'll tell you what.

01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:54.980
If iTunes had come out right after Napster went down,

01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:57.460
there would not be the piracy on the internet, to the extent

01:33:57.460 --> 01:33:58.520
of which it is right now.

01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:00.180
There would still be people like Loki who would still

01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:02.700
have their ways of pirating things, IRC, da, da, da, da.

01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:04.380
It would not be as big as it was now.

01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:07.740
People would be using iTunes because it's really well done.

01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:10.060
And I just want to say the reason why I've used iTunes

01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:14.540
reason why I've downloaded and paid for songs on iTunes is A. To some extent I believe in

01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:18.220
supporting the artist for a song I really really like and the songs I downloaded I really

01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:24.320
really like and B. Because when I try to find these songs on file share I get shit copies

01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:30.500
every time I get lousy volume I get just cut things and you know what it is just worth

01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:36.740
the god damn dollar to just get a perfect quality song the first time. The end. That's

01:34:36.740 --> 01:35:05.740
I'm sorry, what I was going to say is that people who will probably go, oh no, piracy would be where it is now, even if they did do it. It may have gotten to the point eventually, but not as quickly, because I believe that once you put an obstacle in the way of somebody, and they want to overcome it, they will.

01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:10.300
they will, and they'll find a way to overcome it. You put trials in front of somebody who

01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:15.300
wants to pass these, to get over these obstacles, it's just going to make them want to get there

01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:20.780
faster. They're going to find their way over it. So, I think that's a good point. I mean,

01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:25.420
if they had put it up, they wouldn't be having as much problems right now with what they've

01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:29.260
been doing. But they did. End of story. RIA did not act

01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:34.300
fast enough, which is why the MPAA is trying so hard right now with the movies thing. They're

01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:38.540
trying to get all these movie services up and going, and although Loki's right, there's

01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:43.780
not that many people that really want to watch movies online. They're trying.

01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:49.460
Movies is a thing that will never, ever be done like that. I mean, until every freaking

01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:53.140
house gets their own movie theater, because people want to go see stuff on the big screen

01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:58.520
with nice theater systems, but games, home console games, it's a possibility that we

01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:01.900
could go completely online and have to download everything, because you're not changing the

01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:05.020
experience, except for the people who want to go...

01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:09.140
You are changing experience, because now not only do I have to go buy a game system that's

01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:12.740
fucking expensive when it comes out because they have all these new features, now I have

01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:17.220
to buy a membership online, now I have to buy cable internet, where I might not have

01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:20.900
it, you know, because it's not going to work on dial-up. Oh, but if I do have dial-up,

01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:25.300
it's going to take four goddamn years to download the goddamn game, and what if there's a disconnection

01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:29.140
on, you know, what if my cable goes out or something? There goes my game, I don't have

01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:33.700
game store to my hard drive because that crashes, too. It's just too much stuff. You're going

01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:38.220
to have a game. How are they going to rent product then out at the stores? The rental

01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:43.940
businesses for games are going to go out because it's all online supposedly, but the MPAA would

01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:49.740
not care. They would love to see that happen. The MPAA would care because people like to

01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:54.660
rent movies. They don't like to buy movies, okay? Because renting a movie costs $5. You

01:36:54.660 --> 01:37:00.260
see it once, you're done. Instead of investing that money and watching that movie and having

01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:05.820
it at home, like I have tons of movies I buy and don't watch, it's just stupid. But if

01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:10.980
they could be in control of the movie renting and not Blockbuster, that's capitalism.

01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:17.180
See, like I said, the movie renting and movie business will not change completely. It won't

01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:21.660
go completely online. Regardless of whether people want to buy or rent or whatever, people

01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:24.540
still want to see movies on the big screen, and if they want to rent them, they'll go

01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:29.260
to the movie rental places and rent them. Those won't go out of business. Maybe renting

01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:35.260
video games will go, but the fact is that they're obviously not going to implement or

01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:41.940
try to implement something like that until every Internet connection in America is broadband,

01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:46.060
until it's standard to get broadband and extremely cost efficient.

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:50.900
The only way it will ever be like that is when broadband becomes as common as electricity.

01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:52.140
That's the only way.

01:37:52.140 --> 01:37:56.620
Which is something that they've talked about in the last five years ago.

01:37:56.620 --> 01:38:00.300
There was a thing called, I can't remember, I used to have the website for it, but they

01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:05.100
were basically saying that they could get speeds of fiber optic speed, how fast fiber

01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:10.420
optic networks go, that kind of speed from your electrical outlet.

01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:14.140
They could do this thing where they could make the, they take the digital signal from

01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:18.540
wherever the server is, they convert it to analog, and they put it in I think a really,

01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:22.540
really low frequency, just kind of like how DSL is, and they run it through the power

01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:28.820
lines, and it goes at like fiber optic speeds, and they just have to install these, they

01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:33.660
have to build these up, these like switching boxes in cities, in certain areas, because

01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:39.960
there's only so much, there's a signal degradation that happens, you know. And so, that was like

01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:42.900
five years ago, and they said they were still working on it, and they want it, but basically

01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:47.940
that kind of idea makes you wonder, you know, in the near future, in like the next ten years,

01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:52.400
We could see where you plug in your appliance, your computer, to the wall, and it's got Internet

01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:53.400
connection instantly.

01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:56.660
They talk about fridges with Internet connection and all this crazy stuff.

01:38:56.660 --> 01:38:58.120
They talk about that on the same page.

01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:01.500
They said something about how, like, what if your toaster was plugged in?

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:03.640
I don't want my toaster being plugged in, Internet, obviously.

01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:06.820
I don't want fricking, like, advertisements burning onto my toast.

01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:10.260
My toaster comes up and it's got an Apple logo on it.

01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:13.420
I can see it writing in your journal, today kind of sucked.

01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:17.420
A hacker broke into my toaster today and started burning my bread.

01:39:17.420 --> 01:39:20.420
Exactly. See, I don't want that kind of thing.

01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:23.420
All right. I just want to bring up a point from the camera real fast.

01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:24.420
My blender wouldn't stop.

01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:26.420
John Fields makes a pretty good point. He says,

01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:34.420
All I have to say, if the MPAA had control of renting, unfair monopoly that the government would thus force Blockbuster to take over again.

01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:40.420
So he's suggesting that the MPAA did have control of all of this stuff, the unfair monopoly, like what Microsoft's being subjected to right now.

01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:43.420
Good point. There's not much I can respond to that. Good point.

01:39:43.420 --> 01:39:44.420
Oh, well.

01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:48.420
It's fun to just say, you know, who knows.

01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:53.640
Speaking from the perspective of talking to the store owners all the time, they are not

01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:58.700
smart enough to do this all online and they will fight this to the death.

01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:02.540
You have to understand, most of the people that you talk to out there, I mean, because

01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:08.060
we have our exposure with our friends who are all connected to here and all wired individuals,

01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:11.580
but your average Joe doesn't know jack about computers, won't touch it because they act

01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:12.580
like it's the devil.

01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:13.580
My father.

01:40:13.580 --> 01:40:37.760
other.

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:38.760
Here's proof.

01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:50.020
the 80s and late 70s when arcade games were coming out. People who played arcade games

01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:59.020
were usually a lot older. Video game consoles started coming out and with the newer generations

01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:05.920
kids started playing at younger ages. My friend's brother could beat Chrono Trigger and get every

01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:13.320
freaking ending at the age of five, next generation comes along, they all are online at age three.

01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:18.280
I have a friend whose son used to play games online at age three, and I'm not shitting

01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:21.800
you. Pretty soon, everybody is going to be born with a freaking mouse in their hand.

01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:22.800
I mean, it's just the way it is.

01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:26.760
I just want to make a quick plug. On Vanilla Sky tomorrow night, we're going to bring up

01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:32.040
an article where they talk about these young kids, and they're going to make these young

01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:36.840
kids play games that we played when we were young kids. Just wait to hear what they have

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:43.840
to say. You are going to feel so old tomorrow night. 7 o'clock, vanilla Skype.

01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:51.260
I love that idea. I don't understand. The characters don't talk to you, like vocally.

01:41:51.260 --> 01:41:58.260
So which block am I? Ew, what is this little blocky thing? Why is that ostrich attacking

01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:27.980
There will always be a way.

01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:31.060
who are out there saying, no, it's worthless.

01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:34.420
No, there will always be a way to remember that.

01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:36.380
OK, if you'd like to comment on any of that,

01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:40.180

one and only cage match.

01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:54.140
Yes, the Orange Lounge cage match

01:42:54.140 --> 01:42:56.580
is where we're going to play three songs back to back,

01:42:56.580 --> 01:43:01.580
One picked by me, one picked by DarkSapra, even though she's not here, she submitted her vote online to me.

01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:03.580
And one picked by Loki.

01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:05.580
And you can vote for one of those three songs.

01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:09.580
The winner goes into musical rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:13.580
So you, the chatroom, have the power to decide which song will be played all week.

01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:17.580
We start off with last week's winner, which is a song brought to us by Loki.

01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:20.580
And since it was last week's winner, we're only going to hear a clip of it.

01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:25.580
The song is P8107, and it's a remix of Paranoia by...

01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:27.980
Ono Ken. Thank you, Ono Ken.

01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:32.300
So here it is. This is a clip because it was last week's winner. You only get to hear a little bit of it.

01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:36.620
Song number one tonight, last week's winner, P8107.

01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:43.620
here we go

01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:08.620
Oh

01:44:36.620 --> 01:45:06.440
Alright, that's song number one for tonight.

01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:09.800
It's P8107 by OnoKen.

01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:12.840
Song number two tonight is my pick, and you get to hear the whole thing because it's a

01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:14.000
new song.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:18.440
I was on the internet not too long ago just downloading a bunch of remixes by Above & Beyond

01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:20.560
because I fucking love them, they're great.

01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:23.280
And so I wanted to get as many remixes by them as I could, and this is one of the ones

01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:24.280
I got.

01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:28.160
This is an artist called Ministry of Sound, and the song is Far From In Love, and it's

01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:29.800
the Above & Beyond mix.

01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:30.800
Enjoy.

01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:37.800
number two tonight that you can vote for in the cage match.

01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:35.800
Yeah.

01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:40.800
Yeah.

01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:45.800
Yeah.

01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:50.800
Yeah.

01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:55.800
Yeah.

01:46:55.800 --> 01:47:12.800
I can see behind your eyes, but you're afraid of who you are.

01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:17.800
All these silence now between us, I'm amazed.

01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:22.800
From this far, far from enough

01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:29.800
Far from enough

01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:36.800
Like a fire burning in its animal

01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:39.800
This is where it ends

01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:42.800
In the ashes we are dying

01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:46.300
I'm a stranger, only friends

01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:49.300
I'm running out

01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:53.300
I'm running out

01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:56.300
I'm running out

01:47:56.300 --> 01:48:00.300
You know I won't know how to be in smoke

01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:02.300
I'm running out

01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:05.300
I'm running out

01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:10.300
I'm running out

01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:18.300
From all the love I've had with you

01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:25.300
Now I've missed your touch

01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:45.300
I've been living everywhere now just looking back

01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:50.300
And if you try

01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:59.300
I'm trying to show the love that was built up this year

01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:05.300
Yeah, she's so great

01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:59.180
Alright, that was, I'm being corrected on the artist, sorry guys.

01:49:59.180 --> 01:50:04.820
Was actually above and beyond themselves doing that song even better in my opinion far from and love is the song and if you're curious

01:50:04.820 --> 01:50:08.960
About that edit it is from the CD trans nation 2003 which isn't in port by the way

01:50:09.020 --> 01:50:12.100
Let's go around the room and see what people thought of that star off with Loki

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:15.940
It's pretty cool. I liked it

01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:18.660
This is about Beyond

01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:20.660
So, I can't go wrong now.

01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:53.660
p0k3smot42o i wasnt listening to it

01:51:18.660 --> 01:51:24.660
I don't know if I can beat many SGX files on this simulator, so sorry I didn't hear it.

01:51:24.660 --> 01:51:30.660
You didn't hear any of it at all? You were standing right there!

01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:35.660
Is this Loki's pick, or whose? Yours? I'm gonna give it a 1.

01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:37.660
Gonna help.

01:51:37.660 --> 01:51:41.660
Alright, that was song number 2 above and beyond, far from 11.

01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:45.660
Here is... what? We're doing what again?

01:51:45.660 --> 01:51:51.820
Oh, I thought the show was fucking up all right song number three is Jamie's pick

01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:54.420
She sends this along even though she can't be here

01:51:54.420 --> 01:51:58.580
She wants you all to hear it and hope that it'll win tonight's cage match here. It is I

01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:05.320
Listen to this song before the show a little bit. It's pretty good. It's an a vex song you guys know a vex 2dx

01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:07.620
Licenses a lot of tracks from them

01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:10.060
Getting mic switch on me

01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:15.580
Okay, the song is called Ways of Love and the artist is CyberX featuring Jodie

01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:20.060
Watley and it's from an album called CyberX so give this a try. If you like

01:52:20.060 --> 01:52:25.300
Avex tracks you just might like this. This is Jamie's pick tonight, CyberX

01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:27.300
featuring Jody Watley with Waves.

01:52:55.300 --> 01:53:03.300
And we carried on that way

01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:07.300
Through the power of emotion

01:53:07.300 --> 01:53:11.300
If you're running once again

01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:16.300
See a hundred million lights

01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:20.300
Shining on you from above now

01:53:20.300 --> 01:53:25.300
Carrying your heart tonight

01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:41.300
I will see you again

01:53:41.300 --> 01:53:45.300
Feeling waves of love

01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:48.300
Messages we send

01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:52.300
Feel the waves of love

01:53:52.300 --> 01:53:55.300
There's a new horizon

01:53:55.300 --> 01:53:58.300
With the rising sun

01:53:58.300 --> 01:54:02.300
We can reach the heavens

01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:07.300
On the waves of love

01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:09.300
The waves of love

01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:39.400
No one is but you

01:54:39.400 --> 01:55:07.400
No one is around

01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:22.400
We're beyond the X-Men scene There's a phase of knowing tomorrow

01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:32.400
And the way ahead is clear With your flight and this control

01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:35.900
You can open up your feelings

01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:39.900
And bear your heart and soul

01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:42.900
I will see you again

01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:46.900
Feel the waves of love

01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:49.900
Rest the tears we shed

01:55:49.900 --> 01:55:53.400
Feel the waves of love

01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:56.900
There's a new horizon

01:55:56.900 --> 01:56:00.400
This projection

01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:03.400
We can reach the heavens

01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:09.400
On the waves of love

01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:12.400
The waves of love

01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:15.400
I can feel your hands

01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:19.400
Feel the waves of love

01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:22.400
Message every step

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:26.400
Feel the waves of love

01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:29.400
There's a new horizon

01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:41.400
When the light is on, we can reach the heavens on the waves of love.

01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:46.400
dukeofthebump

01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:17.040
drag for me towards the end, but I do typically like most Avex tracks, so I'll be nice and

01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:19.480
give it a seven and a half.

01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:24.960
The trance song is supposed to sound the same for like seven minutes, different. I can't

01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:27.840
explain it, but it's different. Just go with it, okay?

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:32.840
Jamie sends her vote online and she says, of course, her song gets a ten for being Exciting

01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:11.880
I've said before to other people I don't really like trance songs unless it's the Kiriyama

01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:15.640
Oka, so I'm giving it a 5.

01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:16.640
You're mean.

01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:20.920
I'm not trying to be mean, just trance can't really be interesting unless it's the Kiriyama

01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:21.920
Oka.

01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:22.920
Alright, alright.

01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:24.920
You're entitled to your opinion, even if it's us.

01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:27.160
Alright, here we go.

01:58:27.160 --> 01:58:28.160
Here's a recap.

01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:31.200
You can send your votes in very soon, but you have to be in the chat room.

01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:34.240
And you know what, now is a great night to be in our chat room, because it's crowded

01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:35.240
in there.

01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:36.240
There's lots of people in there tonight.

01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:40.840
Now why aren't all of you on the stream, because I know that there's more people in the chat

01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:44.000
room than are on the stream, so shame on you.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:48.120

01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:52.040
Alright, meet some new people, and we want to meet you, we want to meet new people tonight.

01:58:52.040 --> 01:58:54.080
Okay, keep the microphone over there, Brett.

01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:57.140
Here you go, you can vote for one of these three songs.

01:58:57.140 --> 01:59:17.140
Next week's winner, P-1, hey shut up, here's a recap, first song you can vote for, P-8107.

01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:23.140
All right, song number two you can vote for tonight, Ministry, I'm sorry, Above and Beyond with Far From In Love.

01:59:31.140 --> 01:59:36.140
All right, and song number three you can vote for tonight is Cyber X featuring Jodie Watley with Waves of Love.

01:59:36.140 --> 01:59:46.820
All right, there you go.

01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:48.620
Place vote now.

01:59:48.620 --> 01:59:51.480
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:54.900
If you don't know how to do that, just ask somebody and they'll tell you how you send

01:59:54.900 --> 01:59:56.100
a private message to Sky.

01:59:56.100 --> 01:59:57.500
Votes made public in the chat room.

01:59:57.500 --> 01:59:59.740
Don't count.

01:59:59.740 --> 02:00:01.740
All right.

02:00:01.740 --> 02:00:06.540
So, back to the show while we tally up those votes for CAGEMATCH as they come in.

02:00:06.540 --> 02:00:12.340
Loki, tell us about this other project you've kind of been working on lately, you're working

02:00:12.340 --> 02:00:15.580
on it now, you've been working on it for a little while, what is, what's up with this?

02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:21.740
You're kind of taking StepMania modification to the extreme from what I see, no pun intended.

02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:29.680
Well, I'm just, right now, because no one can see this out there in, you know, Radioland,

02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:31.500
i'm making a new banner

02:00:31.500 --> 02:00:32.780
for uh...

02:00:32.780 --> 02:00:34.260
dancehouse revolution

02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:36.760
it's uh... basically here's what i've been doing

02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:41.180
i've been trying to pitch an idea to keith at golf land because

02:00:41.180 --> 02:00:44.420
i've seen it done before where you

02:00:44.420 --> 02:00:47.060
basically wire a uh...

02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:47.980
stepmania

02:00:47.980 --> 02:00:51.040
pc you know to uh... ddr machine

02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:55.020
and run stepmania on there, well stepmania is meant to run as an arcade machine itself

02:00:55.020 --> 02:00:55.820
because

02:00:55.820 --> 02:00:59.380
it's got options for credits and all that stuff so

02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:03.660
obviously that's what i'm doing here in in-house uh... with

02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:06.900
you know cabinets being built but i thought you know why not do that in

02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:08.280
arcade too

02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:12.260
so i've been basically looking into licensing rights and what it would cost

02:01:12.260 --> 02:01:13.320
you know because

02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:16.440
obviously i'm not going to ask konami for permission because no

02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:19.200
they're never going to say yes so we're doing it anyways

02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:20.900
uh... but uh...

02:01:20.900 --> 02:01:23.160
i've been looking into like if you know music

02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:26.400
you know artists or something was to come after me how

02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:31.760
you know, what actual licensing rights we would need. So, I checked into it. Basically,

02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:37.880
a stamp-mini based game could be considered a jukebox because it's just, you know, music

02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:43.000
being played. And so, it would fall under jukebox license rights, I think. I don't know.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:48.200
It's a gray area but it only cost $364 a year to actually legally license it. But if we

02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:55.320
did all like Konami original stuff and just basically, it's going to be, you know, I want

02:01:55.320 --> 02:02:01.740
them to put a sim in the arcade and charge money for people to play it and basically

02:02:01.740 --> 02:02:08.960
skin it like an official mix and be so convincing that any idiot out there that doesn't know

02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:11.380
much about the sim world would think it's an official.

02:02:11.380 --> 02:02:16.380
So that's what I'm going to do and right now I'm making a banner for Dance Dance Revolution

02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:17.380
EX2.

02:02:17.380 --> 02:02:19.580
That's what I've got right now.

02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:21.300
What the hell are you doing?

02:02:21.300 --> 02:02:23.300
You fucking idiot.

02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:42.500
It looks like it's kind of squashed vertically, I have to fix that, but yeah, that's what

02:02:42.500 --> 02:02:45.940
I was doing it pretty much if you know Keith says no what you probably will

02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:48.460
because you know he has to ask management and I'm sure they're gonna be

02:02:48.460 --> 02:02:52.740
like no you know if he was this was back at Scandia before he left he would

02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:57.940
definitely done it but right now the feasibility is probably not gonna it's

02:02:57.940 --> 02:03:02.380
not gonna happen there but this is just for my own you know machine pretty much

02:03:02.380 --> 02:03:06.620
because if you think about it I could probably make a better mix in Konami Ken

02:03:06.620 --> 02:03:11.980
so why not give it a chance and I I posed the option to them I'm like look

02:03:11.980 --> 02:03:16.540
get past the initial investment of buying the actual pc which would pay for itself pretty

02:03:16.540 --> 02:03:21.780
quickly since the ddr machines make a ton of money. um, you'd have free upgrades for

02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:28.720
life on that damn thing so software upgrades would be easy but you know...whatever. so

02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:33.800
that's what I've been doing on there. so you think you're gonna get away with it? I mean

02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:38.180
I realize that you're saying that it's probably not gonna make it. but lets say it does make

02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:41.680
it somehow or you buy an arcade. you win the lotter you buy an arcade or you put this machine

02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:46.280
in it, you think you'll make it? Well, yeah, they're really the only people that could

02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:49.620
rain out of my parade, if that were to ever happen, would be the people that play the

02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:54.400
game itself religiously because they're like, oh, oh my God, you know, that's not an official

02:03:54.400 --> 02:04:01.720
Konami game, that's a bootleg. You're running on a sim. But they're looking past, you know,

02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:05.000
what it actually is and not just playing it for what it's supposed to be, which is just

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:10.380
a game, you know. And if Konami's going to stop making arcade games, you know, the U.S.

02:04:10.380 --> 02:04:15.840
isn't making arcade games for DDR and all these games are getting stagnant in arcades,

02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:20.040
people are going to go one of two routes. They're either going to spend a $1500 to buy

02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:25.500
some hacked bootleg which is looking like shit or they're going to run software like

02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:31.700
this that you can emulate, you know, pretty much, you know, emulate DDR perfectly and

02:04:31.700 --> 02:04:36.340
have, you know, new features added to it that aren't seen in any of the games. Plus, you

02:04:36.340 --> 02:04:42.420
you know, your collection of musics, you know, limitless, so why not for free? I mean, you're

02:04:42.420 --> 02:04:47.980
talking about investing maybe, I figured, I was looking at computers and stuff, I could

02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:53.740
probably run this on a $400 PC. So that's an initial investment, $400 versus $1500 for

02:04:53.740 --> 02:04:59.940
a shitty bootleg that just has old music anyways. And we're talking like full unlocks here,

02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:38.580
I don't know. I think unless people made it a real big deal about it, it's not like I'm

02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:46.240
selling it. It's a one arcade exclusive thing. I don't see what the big deal would be. But

02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:55.860
we should have never invited him over. Brad is being a total cam whore right now. What

02:05:55.860 --> 02:06:02.220
can you do? I'm going to do the cage match winner in a minute, but we have one. There's

02:06:02.220 --> 02:06:05.940
currently a tie in the cage match and I'm waiting on one more vote to see if it breaks

02:06:05.940 --> 02:06:10.100
the tie because one of our new listeners is trying to send a vote along right now. I want

02:06:10.100 --> 02:06:15.620
to talk about DDRXBox for a minute. God, Brad, you're such an idiot. I want to talk about

02:06:15.620 --> 02:06:19.340
DDRXBox for a minute because there was some news this week about DDRXBox and that is that

02:06:19.340 --> 02:06:27.180
it's gone gold. No, it's not sold a certain amount of copies, but it's finished. It's

02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:31.300
in the can, it's done, and it's going to be out November 18th. It's kind of interesting,

02:06:31.300 --> 02:06:36.060
not a lot of knowledge about DDRXBox right now when it comes to songs. We know that there's

02:06:36.060 --> 02:06:41.940
going to be a remix of Absolut in it. We know that it has shiny disco balls in it. The Quickening,

02:06:41.940 --> 02:06:46.300
Castles in the Sky, Mad Blast, I think was another one. Is that what it's called, the

02:07:16.300 --> 02:07:20.240
is not quite as big as it is for a typical Playstation release, I don't know if people

02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:23.660
are just scared because it's different or whatever, or maybe just because the marketing

02:07:23.660 --> 02:07:27.560
hasn't kicked in yet, but I don't know, there just doesn't seem to be a lot of excitement

02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:28.560
about it.

02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:33.880
I just, wouldn't it be interesting if this did well that maybe Konami of Hawaii were

02:07:33.880 --> 02:07:38.740
to put together some new arcade release with their brand new interface they've done and

02:07:38.740 --> 02:07:42.860
their more competitive DDR-ness they have in there and all that stuff?

02:07:42.860 --> 02:07:48.460
Do you have something coherent you want to add to this conversation?

02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:52.260
That's how I said Merry Christmas in Hawaiian.

02:07:52.260 --> 02:07:57.340
Mecha Meleki Maka, something like that.

02:07:57.340 --> 02:08:00.260
Would you fucking talk about something worthwhile, Rob?

02:08:00.260 --> 02:08:02.500
Wait, you don't think Xbox is worthwhile?

02:08:02.500 --> 02:08:03.500
No.

02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:04.500
Why not?

02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:05.500
Xbox.

02:08:05.500 --> 02:08:06.500
Mmm.

02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:07.500
You know what, though?

02:08:07.500 --> 02:08:09.260
There's a lot of folks that, you know.

02:08:09.260 --> 02:08:20.460
Yeah, those are the same people who play sports games, like football, outside, where there's

02:08:20.460 --> 02:08:21.460
bears.

02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:22.460
Alright.

02:08:22.460 --> 02:08:27.900
The only other songs we know, other than those we just mentioned, Colors by DJ Taka from

02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:32.820
Extreme is going to show up in it, and Sugaru, Revenge Vs. Desire, and then there were a

02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:37.280
few more from some list I saw, but I don't remember it, so that's that.

02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:42.740
We have not had an official song list come out from Konami, that's the point.

02:08:42.740 --> 02:08:51.740
But now that the game's gone gold, maybe they'll send some kind of, I don't know, they'll do

02:08:51.740 --> 02:08:52.740
something.

02:08:52.740 --> 02:08:54.740
I'm Nick Whetsek, Heidi Heidt.

02:08:54.740 --> 02:08:56.740
Let's get to tonight's cage match winner.

02:08:56.740 --> 02:08:58.740
Nicka, Nicka, Hi, Nicka, Johnny Ho.

02:08:58.740 --> 02:09:01.740
Tonight's cage match winner, ladies and gentlemen, is...

02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:03.740
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

02:09:03.740 --> 02:09:04.740
It's a tie.

02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:05.740
What?

02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:06.740
It's a tie.

02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:07.740
Between who?

02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:08.740
So who wins?

02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:09.740
So this is how we do it.

02:09:09.740 --> 02:09:11.740
Because the one song that didn't tie.

02:09:11.740 --> 02:09:12.740
This is the interesting thing.

02:09:12.740 --> 02:09:14.740
It's a tie by one vote.

02:09:14.740 --> 02:09:17.740
If one person had voted for the other song, it would have been a three-way tie.

02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:19.740
So it was very close tonight.

02:09:19.740 --> 02:09:20.740
Ooh, a three-way.

02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:21.740
I know, ooh, a three-way.

02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:33.300
So, here we go. The two songs that tied tonight were last week's winner, P8107, and the second

02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:41.340
song that tied tonight was Above and Beyond with Far From the Love, and Cyberex and Jodie

02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:53.060
Watley was one vote away. That's right, because the rules say the host whose song didn't win

02:09:53.060 --> 02:09:57.020
gets to break the tie. But since she's not here, what do we do? Well, but she is here

02:09:57.020 --> 02:10:01.220
in spirit because she's in the chat room, so I'm going to ask her to send her vote along.

02:10:01.220 --> 02:10:06.120
So we'll find out who won the cage match after the break. I'm going to give her the break

02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:11.980
to deliberate and send her a vote. Oh, never mind, she's already sent it, so let's see.

02:10:11.980 --> 02:10:20.980
And the winner is, drum roll please, Jamie has voted for Far From In Love to win tonight's

02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:26.820
Cage Match. So that is the winner for tonight, in a very, very close, probably the closest

02:10:26.820 --> 02:10:32.500
Cage Match yet. I demand a re- Yeah, we're going to have a re-call, a re-count. It's

02:10:32.500 --> 02:10:34.000
Tell your chads, people!

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:34.500
Make sure you puncture-

02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:38.000
Rocky's song already won two weeks in a row, it was time for it to go.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:38.500
Whatever, dude.

02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:42.000
He wants to do a new song next week, anyway, and she says,

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Eat trance.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:46.000
When she voted for it, she said, eat trance.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
I'm not laughing.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.000
All right.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Uh, there you go, that's tonight's Wonder the Cage match, and goes into rotation all week long on Orange Live Radio.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
We're gonna do a break now when we come back.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
I'd like to fuck my recount, wouldn't you?

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Oh

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:58.000
One more time for the bad boys, baby One more time for the bad boys, baby

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:19.000
One more time for the bad boys, babe

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:25.960
Backwards

02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:32.960
Backwards

02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:39.960
Backwards

02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:42.960
Backwards

02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:44.960
One more time for the backwards

02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:19.960
Whoa.

02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:24.960
Whoa.

02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:29.960
Whoa.

02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:34.960
Whoa.

02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:39.960
Whoa.

02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:15.960
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge big money music and more show?

02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:29.960
The music is like being transported to, uh, just this dancing spaceship place. It's, uh, unearthly. It's like being in a club, except you don't have to, you know, actually ask someone to dance.

02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:38.960
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 65 in progress. And, uh, Dark Sakura's out sick tonight, unfortunately. We wish her she gets better soon.

02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:41.960
Orange Lounge Radio, music you humped to.

02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:47.960
Thank you. Also, Loki and I are sick, but somehow we're continuing to go on.

02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:52.960
I think Loki's not quite as bad off as either Jamie or myself, and I'm probably not as bad off as Jamie.

02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:57.960
I talked to her on the phone earlier, she sounded pretty bad, so I'm somehow faking my way through this show tonight.

02:17:57.960 --> 02:18:00.960
Joining me tonight, lankystyle, over there, hello.

02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:03.960
Baka's complaining there's nothing in the webcam, so I have to go back to my crazy antics.

02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:16.240
What is this you're looking at right now?

02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:19.800
You're looking at pictures of this bootleg Dance Dance Revolution megamix?

02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:24.000
We talked about this last week about Dance Dance Revolution Megamix.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:27.520
But there's pictures of it because it got bought up by a few arcades, one of them being

02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:35.960
Nickel City down in San Jose, and they have screenshots of it. Basically, it looks exactly

02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:41.420
like DDR Extreme, except it's blue in the background. And I say blue in the background,

02:18:41.420 --> 02:18:47.600
you know where there'd be green checkers? Now it's just solid blue, which is lame. But

02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:51.960
that's what it is, and it's like they didn't really know what they were doing when they

02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:59.040
made it and I don't know it's just it's pretty lame and according to this

02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:05.520
there's not really any new songs that looks like I don't know all right as

02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:09.360
promised now it's time to get into the FUs of the week and we're gonna start

02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:13.620
off with Jamie's FUs even though she's not here we do have her FUs so let's

02:19:13.620 --> 02:19:14.620
Let's start.

02:19:14.620 --> 02:19:32.740
F.U. to stupid people on Red Rock Online.

02:19:32.740 --> 02:19:33.740
No, I'm kidding.

02:19:33.740 --> 02:19:34.740
I'm kidding.

02:19:34.740 --> 02:19:35.740
She has real F.U.s.

02:19:35.740 --> 02:19:36.740
Here they are.

02:19:36.740 --> 02:19:41.300
DarkSakura would like to say F.U. to being sick and that I can't take off work because

02:19:41.300 --> 02:19:47.680
of my impending trip to Alabama. FU number 2 is missing the show. FU number 3 is not

02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:53.680
having toilet paper. That must be an interesting house right now. Yeah, we've got plenty. Jamie,

02:19:53.680 --> 02:20:00.680
you should have come over. We've got plenty. We bought like 50 gazillion packs in one at

02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:08.440
Ralph's. FU number 4, my nose is rubbed raw. FU number 5, not having good food at home.

02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:10.840
having good food at home

02:20:10.840 --> 02:20:12.740
F you to being hot

02:20:12.740 --> 02:20:16.460
F you to people who don't pay enough attention to the world around them

02:20:16.460 --> 02:20:18.060
F you to selfish frivolity

02:20:18.060 --> 02:20:20.300
I'm guilty of the same

02:20:20.300 --> 02:20:22.700
and not being able to save money

02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:26.340
F you to bad grammar and spelling and lastly F you to number ten from dark

02:20:26.340 --> 02:20:30.100
sakura F you to idiots

02:20:30.100 --> 02:20:33.640
Zelda? More like Zelda

02:20:33.640 --> 02:20:35.400
Shut up

02:20:35.400 --> 02:20:37.400
Bogey's turn, you're F-used.

02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:06.400
It sucks.

02:21:35.400 --> 02:22:02.680
p0k3smot42o

02:22:02.680 --> 02:22:04.680

p0k3smot42o

02:23:29.960 --> 02:23:37.960
I didn't get to go out to the golf lane because I really wanted to, and, you know, circumstances prevented that, so, oh well.

02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:39.960
I'm done.

02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:41.960
My turn.

02:23:41.960 --> 02:23:49.960
Um, my biggest F.U. this week, obviously, is being sick, because when you're sick, you don't feel like doing shit.

02:23:49.960 --> 02:23:50.960
um

02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:55.360
F you to my friend who went out to the bar with me ice princess

02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:59.300
F you to ice princess for being a drunken fucker on Friday night

02:23:59.300 --> 02:24:03.800
and he was being the biggest bitch ever and he was an hour and a half late to the club

02:24:03.800 --> 02:24:05.960
and no I'm not gonna get over it cause you suck

02:24:05.960 --> 02:24:08.940
you made me wait at the bar for an hour and a half for you

02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:13.320
and ugly old people were hitting on me and therefore you should be punished

02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:16.640
and I'm gonna berate you with this forever

02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:21.640
And F you for getting drunk and grabbing my ass, you faggot.

02:24:21.640 --> 02:24:26.640
Alright, let's move on, that's it.

02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:31.640
Bradley, do you have a mic over there?

02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:36.640
Or Brad or Bradley, somebody?

02:24:36.640 --> 02:24:41.640
Bradley's trying to get a mic.

02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:46.640
dial-up

02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:53.640
the bedroom is back

02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:57.640
with a BH

02:24:57.640 --> 02:24:59.640
uh, fuck you too

02:24:59.640 --> 02:25:01.640
not having any

02:25:01.640 --> 02:25:03.640
hanging low, very long

02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:04.640
I think this sells stuff, but

02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:06.640
actually that's part of the good thing that sells stuff

02:25:06.640 --> 02:25:08.640
because I got too much crap as it is

02:25:08.640 --> 02:25:10.640
that I don't have to look at or use

02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:12.640
So we're gonna get rid of some of this.

02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:28.640
Uh, fuck you to truck drivers, think they own the road, get up behind you, and think that you can drive faster up through the person in front of you if they just ride your ass just five things behind you.

02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:29.640
Five feet behind you.

02:25:29.640 --> 02:25:32.640
Uh, let's see, what else? Anything else?

02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:37.640
Fuck you that I don't have any chips to eat at the cabin.

02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:42.640
I forgot to buy them and fuck you forgetting to buy any apple juice.

02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:47.640
So I had something to drink in the morning other than water.

02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:52.640
I think it's hot.

02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:57.640
Whatever.

02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:02.640
p0k3smot42o

02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:31.640
Stovers, like, TV dinner type things, they suck.

02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:34.640
Especially compared to, like, Mary Colander's, which is...

02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:37.640
They are on sale, like, three out of every four weeks.

02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:39.640
And are generally pretty good.

02:26:39.640 --> 02:26:44.640
And, like, twice as good, twice, three times as good as those crappy dudes and shit.

02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:48.640
That Stovers tries to pawn off a lot of people.

02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:50.640
For three, four bucks.

02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:53.640
Fuck you and your shitty meal.

02:26:53.640 --> 02:26:55.640
Okay, that was stupid.

02:26:55.640 --> 02:26:59.640
On to the chatroom, FUs!

02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:29.640
FU to Stupid Bikers at Davis who are not using the bike circles.

02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:36.640
FU to Stupid Pedestrians at Davis who think walking in the middle of the bike circles will get them across the street faster.

02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:40.640
FU to the DDR Machine in Tap-X at Davis.

02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:45.640
FU to More Drama and a Certain Initial D Community Cop, RTA Cop.

02:27:45.640 --> 02:27:52.640
FU to the Girls who give me Dirty Looks at Paracon today just because I dress differently than they do and probably look better too.

02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:56.640
And F you to the cocky bastards who think they know everything in billiards when they actually suck.

02:27:56.640 --> 02:27:59.640
F you to the germs that got you three sick.

02:27:59.640 --> 02:28:00.640
Thank you.

02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:02.640
F you to Baka for complaining.

02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:08.640
And F you to my friend for saying that all Loki does is bitch.

02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:12.640
Can I respond to that, Loki?

02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:17.640
I think the segment was called F you of the week, you know, because that's where you bitch.

02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:21.640
I don't know, I just, you know, I thought.

02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:24.640
Oh, he's a bitch. I haven't been bitching today.

02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:25.640
I've been good.

02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:27.640
You've been pretty good. I'll give you that.

02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:30.640
But now that he mentioned that, I'm going in.

02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:32.640
Rice Princess says,

02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:33.640
Fuck Casey!

02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:35.640
Oh, guess what? I brought actual rice today.

02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:36.640
So there.

02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:40.640
For all those people that said I cook with minute rice, you can suck it.

02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:42.640
Are you done? Are you spent?

02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:45.640
Yeah, it's just, you know, fulfilling the bitching part.

02:28:45.640 --> 02:28:50.640
Oh, F-you the fact that my printer didn't come with the appropriate USB cable to hook it up.

02:29:20.640 --> 02:29:26.360
FU to being too broke to see Kill Bill again, and FU to Imperium for being so damn expensive.

02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:32.960
I want to have the Crazy 88 Guild, dammit.

02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:35.460
John Fields would like to say FU to one of my

02:29:35.460 --> 02:29:40.440

02:30:14.760 --> 02:30:18.760
The next thing I'm going to bitch about is having too much money, because you know, woo!

02:30:21.760 --> 02:30:26.760
And she likes to agree, hee hee, dirty ball licking truck drivers, damn.

02:30:27.760 --> 02:30:29.760
She was agreeing with a previous FU.

02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:38.760
No Stylin says, my FU is for not having any Let the Hit Dem remix ferret remix.

02:30:39.760 --> 02:30:41.760
I don't know, this is No Stylin, okay?

02:30:41.760 --> 02:30:42.760
Okay.

02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:47.720
FU to Orange Lounge for not having people on the cam besides Brad.

02:30:47.720 --> 02:30:49.080
I mean, where's the rest of the crew?

02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:50.880
Well, Loki's working on his computer.

02:30:50.880 --> 02:30:53.240
I'm trying to operate the control panel, which is off-cam.

02:30:53.240 --> 02:30:54.240
They're dead!

02:30:54.240 --> 02:30:55.560
They're all dead!

02:30:55.560 --> 02:31:00.440
And Bradley is sitting in Jamie's hiding blue chair, so what can you do?

02:31:00.440 --> 02:31:02.080
I'm boring on your way on the cam.

02:31:02.080 --> 02:31:05.320

If you want to do this or die, and we'll maybe do some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:32:17.240 --> 02:32:20.560
If you have a question for Ask Orange Lounge, remember DarkSakura is not here tonight, so

02:32:20.560 --> 02:32:21.560
she can't answer your questions.

02:32:21.560 --> 02:32:23.560
If you have a question for her, it's going to have to wait.

02:32:23.560 --> 02:32:28.120
If you have something me, Loki, Brad, or Bradley could answer, hey, we'd love to help you out.

02:32:28.120 --> 02:32:31.640
Send on a question and we'll do the best we can.

02:32:31.640 --> 02:32:32.640
Why?

02:32:32.640 --> 02:32:39.640
In the meantime, let's hear, I want to hear something from BeatMania CoreMix, I think.

02:32:39.640 --> 02:32:41.640
Let's hear Emotion, the romantic style.

02:32:41.640 --> 02:32:43.640
No, we don't want to hear that.

02:32:43.640 --> 02:32:44.640
Yes, we do.

02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:46.640
It was originally in BeatMania CoreMix, though.

02:32:46.640 --> 02:32:47.640
That's where it is.

02:32:47.640 --> 02:32:48.640
I know, but that was also in Nine Style.

02:32:48.640 --> 02:32:49.640
Well, you know what?

02:32:49.640 --> 02:32:50.640
I don't care.

02:32:50.640 --> 02:32:53.640
I want to hear the Yodeler remix of the DJ Battle.

02:32:53.640 --> 02:32:54.640
Okay, fine.

02:32:54.640 --> 02:32:56.640
We'll hear the Yodeler remix of the DJ Battle.

02:32:56.640 --> 02:32:57.640
That's really annoying.

02:32:57.640 --> 02:32:58.640
Fine.

02:32:58.640 --> 02:32:59.640
That's the other...

02:32:59.640 --> 02:33:01.640
Nuh-huh, nuh-nuh-huh-huh.

02:33:01.640 --> 02:33:03.640
Instant love, what's the last thing?

02:33:03.640 --> 02:33:04.640
Nuh-huh, nuh-nuh-huh-huh.

02:33:04.640 --> 02:33:05.640
Instant love.

02:33:05.640 --> 02:33:07.640
Well, we'll see if we can fit instant love in.

02:33:07.640 --> 02:33:10.640
I'll play 20 November, the final edit, too, because it's pretty good.

02:33:10.640 --> 02:33:11.640
We'll be back.

02:33:11.640 --> 02:33:12.640
Nuh-huh-nuh-huh.

02:33:12.640 --> 02:33:13.640
I'll be back.

02:33:13.640 --> 02:33:20.640
Do you really think that you can crash, Will?

02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:25.640
Well, if you keep up with my crash technique, I'll accept it.

02:33:25.640 --> 02:33:26.640
Right?

02:33:26.640 --> 02:33:27.640
Get ready.

02:33:27.640 --> 02:33:28.640
Get ready!

02:33:57.640 --> 02:34:01.640
Alright, I'll consider your talent.

02:34:01.640 --> 02:34:05.640
Look, the dance floor is waiting for you to start.

02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:09.640
If you keep up with my track technique, I'll accept it.

02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:12.640
All right, get ready.

02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:51.480
Yes, that's a great play, look, the dance floor is waiting for you to start.

02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:58.480
Christ that song is annoying, oh well, since we put the F U in fun, here you go.

02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:50.480
I know you all know Beat Media, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.

02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:53.480
So listen carefully and try to follow

02:36:53.480 --> 02:36:56.480
The object will come down from the top

02:36:56.480 --> 02:36:59.480
When it hits the red line, push the button

02:36:59.480 --> 02:37:00.480
Yeah

02:37:00.480 --> 02:37:04.480
When it hits the red line, turn the table

02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:08.480
You get it? Alright, let's practice

02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:11.480
First, hit the white key

02:37:11.480 --> 02:37:13.480
People know you go from above, you really know

02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:15.480
Something like a face below

02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:22.480
Okay, now a combination of both white and black keys.

02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:39.480
Okay, now a combination of both white and black keys.

02:37:39.480 --> 02:37:59.480
All right, let's go on to the Scratch thing, when the objects reach the red line, Scratch!

02:37:59.480 --> 02:38:03.480
With a fact note, the technique is to scratch fast.

02:38:11.980 --> 02:38:15.480
Now it's all the keys and the turntable.

02:38:15.480 --> 02:38:17.480
It's hard, but you can do it!

02:38:36.980 --> 02:38:37.480
Okay!

02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:39.480
F-Sector guys!

02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:43.480
Here's the spec of the new BeatMania!

02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:47.480
Look, way below, do you see the effect?

02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:50.480
That's the effect on and on switch.

02:38:50.480 --> 02:38:54.480
With this trimmer, you can choose your effect.

02:38:54.480 --> 02:38:58.480
I'll show you, so trim with me, alright?

02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:05.480
Hey, do you hear the variety of effects?

02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:10.480
With this trimmer, you can change the strength and the depth of the effect.

02:39:12.480 --> 02:39:17.480
This powerful sound system will make everybody hot!

02:39:18.480 --> 02:39:22.480
Alright, gotta go! Do not move out with your fabulous sound!

02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:26.480
I'm missing every single version of this video

02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:55.480
No, nobody does, yes, baby.

02:39:55.480 --> 02:39:57.480
Sign my baby balloon.

02:39:57.480 --> 02:40:01.480
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:05.480
Sign my baby balloon.

02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:07.480
Bitch, get a new song.

02:40:07.480 --> 02:40:10.480
An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

02:40:10.480 --> 02:40:12.480
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:14.480
We're going to do Ask Orange Lounge here in a little bit.

02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:16.480
We got a ton of freaking questions tonight,

02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:19.480
so we're going to address all your questions.

02:40:19.480 --> 02:40:21.480
First off, I just wanted to say, before the break,

02:40:21.480 --> 02:40:25.800
For the break, I said that there's stuff you can do to help Bahmani out right now.

02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:27.400
There's a couple of things.

02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:35.020
First off, 2DX consumer style, the new one, at last count, they have about almost just

02:40:35.020 --> 02:40:38.920
shy of 9,000 responses and they only need 10,000.

02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:41.960
So in the next nine days, they're going to need 1,000 more responses.

02:40:41.960 --> 02:40:50.920
So if all the listeners can get in on that, then we'll have it down to a good 998.

02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:53.920
I think it's five days from now, like the 24th.

02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:54.920
Is it?

02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:55.920
I think it's the 24th.

02:40:55.920 --> 02:40:58.920
Alright, whatever, I did my math wrong, so whatever.

02:40:58.920 --> 02:41:02.920
So, there's not a lot of time left, so get your ass over to KonamiStyle and sign that.

02:41:02.920 --> 02:41:07.920
I don't have a direct URL for it, sorry guys, but maybe somebody in the chat room will be kind enough to post one.

02:41:07.920 --> 02:41:11.920
It's about to happen more than it was like a week, five days ago.

02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:15.920
Yeah, there's a direct link on the 15th.

02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:18.920
There's a direct link on BomaniStyle somewhere, so look for that.

02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:22.000
speaking of the money style the other thing I was gonna say is that um they

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:26.160
are going to be distributing tax new CD bounce connected but they need to get I

02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:30.280
think about 200 orders for it and they only have about 75 right now I think

02:41:30.280 --> 02:41:35.920
when I did the math was it oh I thought it was 25 paid and then 50 reserved I

02:41:35.920 --> 02:41:41.160
was plus plus 75 but still um if you guys are interested in picking up bounce

02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:44.120
connected head out of the money style it's right on the top of their page in

02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:48.200
the bottom left and tell more zones radio sent you so that you know they'll

02:41:48.200 --> 02:41:52.060
think we're cool and also I'm after they get money after they get bounce

02:41:52.060 --> 02:41:57.180
connected ordered up they're gonna order more CDs from diverse systems one of the

02:41:57.180 --> 02:42:03.460
CDs called hello boss features p8 107 so you know that's definitely a CD you're

02:42:03.460 --> 02:42:08.060
gonna want to check out because it's got a ton of awesome remixes by the Japanese

02:42:08.060 --> 02:42:11.860
artists who are a lot better at remixing bimani music than the American artist

02:42:11.860 --> 02:42:38.860
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid questions, but I'm not singing because I'm sick so fuck off.

02:42:38.860 --> 02:42:41.860
Ask some questions.

02:43:08.860 --> 02:43:13.260
Next month, we're going to go MP3 Pro, which means even if you're on a modem, you can still

02:43:13.260 --> 02:43:14.260
get DSL quality sound.

02:43:14.260 --> 02:43:15.260
That's going to be exciting.

02:43:15.260 --> 02:43:19.860
You know, I forgot to mention something with my FUs, and I was totally like past that segment,

02:43:19.860 --> 02:43:27.900
but FUs are that stupid Modesto Mitsubishi commercial that lasted a good half hour.

02:43:27.900 --> 02:43:30.940
You suck, and that crazy Mexican guy is funny.

02:43:30.940 --> 02:43:33.340
And that put that segue into this.

02:43:33.340 --> 02:43:37.380
This is why we don't put quality radio out there, because irritating radio stays with

02:43:37.380 --> 02:43:43.560
you longer than quality radio. Quality radio gets forgotten. Irritating radio stays with

02:43:43.560 --> 02:43:50.560
you. I just took a piss. Thank you. If you don't like our station, I challenge you to

02:43:54.200 --> 02:44:01.200
do something better. Or the easy way, just fuck yourself. But I know that's not what

02:44:01.200 --> 02:44:07.200
But I know that's not what you meant, so, hugs and kisses from you to me. Or from me to you.

02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:09.200
Hold on, who was the one who had the question?

02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:11.200
Uh, one of Violent Hypergirl's friends.

02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:16.200
Oh. Sorry I don't know you, I don't want to be mean or anything, but fuck yourself.

02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:20.200
Alright. My other friend wants to know the purpose of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:26.200
The purpose of Orange Lounge Radio is so that we can make asses of ourselves on the internet.

02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:43.200
2. When will the next Mass Orange Lounge Radio orgy be?

02:44:56.200 --> 02:45:01.200
cuz she's a chick that plays video games

02:45:01.200 --> 02:45:06.200
cuz rad is so from the 80s

02:45:06.200 --> 02:45:11.200
cuz she's so from the 80s

02:45:11.200 --> 02:45:16.200
cuz she's so from the 80s

02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:21.200
what was that brad?

02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:28.200
I don't know, I don't care what Brad thinks.

02:45:28.200 --> 02:45:30.240
Skye, do you enjoy saying my Nick?

02:45:30.240 --> 02:45:37.880
You always seem to every time you say it because I say, Ninst, it's just me being my wacky

02:45:37.880 --> 02:45:38.880
DJ.

02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:40.240
I'm a wacky internet DJ.

02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:44.360
Ninst would like to send in this request for you give love a bad name.

02:45:44.360 --> 02:45:48.640
It's 915 and 72 degrees in the Sacramento area.

02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:50.200
I don't know.

02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:54.040
You have a fun name to say, just like Sean the Horny Master, so it's Nince the Horny

02:45:54.040 --> 02:45:55.840
Master as far as I'm concerned.

02:45:55.840 --> 02:45:59.320
It's just like, you're like Casey Kasem, Lil' Jenny Sinz.

02:45:59.320 --> 02:46:01.760
What was that on?

02:46:01.760 --> 02:46:06.600
There was a funny joke, one comedian, I think it was on a Colin Quinn show, he was talking

02:46:06.600 --> 02:46:11.640
about like Casey Kasem and stuff, and how he's like, he's like, yes, so this one is

02:46:11.640 --> 02:46:15.880
for Lil' Julie, whose brother's stuck in a coma in the hospital.

02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:20.560
Here is me so horny.

02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:26.880
Vince would also like to know, Tuesday is coming, did you bring your coat?

02:46:26.880 --> 02:46:28.360
It's from Rejected.

02:46:28.360 --> 02:46:36.240
Anyway, Teehee, Teehee, Rejected Joke, hello and welcome to Last Week.

02:46:36.240 --> 02:46:40.080
But son, it's only Tuesday.

02:46:40.080 --> 02:46:41.560
Shut up.

02:46:41.560 --> 02:46:45.360
23rd Magus would like to know, where can I find a good international lawyer?

02:46:45.360 --> 02:46:52.080
I need to crack down on these illegal Portuguese joke book makers.

02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:53.080
Moving on.

02:46:53.080 --> 02:46:54.080
Huh?

02:46:54.080 --> 02:46:58.080
Yeah, the dead silence reflects everyone everywhere in response to that segment.

02:46:58.080 --> 02:47:00.600
I totally wasn't paying attention.

02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:05.480
The orange lounge madam pixie dust or penne princess as she'd like to be called tonight.

02:47:05.480 --> 02:47:07.440
Okay, here's a real question for Loki.

02:47:07.440 --> 02:47:08.760
It's not penne.

02:47:08.760 --> 02:47:10.160
It's peni.

02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:13.840
I like saying penne because it sounds like T-N-A, which is what pixie dust makes me think

02:47:13.840 --> 02:47:22.520
Why does Loki make fun of the fact that my F.U. goes to me having big tits? You try having

02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:24.880
big boobs for a week and see how cheap you feel.

02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:33.960
real? I don't even know how to respond to this. What are you talking about? He has big

02:47:33.960 --> 02:47:41.200
boobs. He has big man boobs. I have nice sized breasts, but those are all my girlfriends,

02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:49.680
so, you know. Oh, there you go. There you go. I don't feel cheap at all. All right.

02:47:49.680 --> 02:47:58.840
I'm going back to some violent hyper girl questions here because she said a bunch.

02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:02.480
Can you put the camel toe song back in circulation on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:48:02.480 --> 02:48:03.480
Nope.

02:48:03.480 --> 02:48:09.040
But you might hear it on one of the spinoff shows, Vanilla Sky, Monday nights at 7 o'clock

02:48:09.040 --> 02:48:13.080
or pump up the volume, Jamie's Spinoff Show, Tuesday nights at 730.

02:48:13.080 --> 02:48:17.640
If you're really lucky and you give them head, you might hear it on Loki's show, Live Wire,

02:48:17.640 --> 02:48:28.440
coming back in November on Wednesdays.

02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:32.960
Her friend wants to know, why am I so violent?

02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:38.520
I would say it's all that pent up sexual energy.

02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:40.520
But you know that can be fixed.

02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:47.520
up sexual energy should be unleashed on the masses like a limbic break Pip has a question

02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:53.800
Pip would like to know what home pads do you guys use I have an ignition camera I have

02:48:53.800 --> 02:49:01.000
an ignition that was I kind of got out of a relationship because my ex has been too

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:05.920
lazy to pick it up and I guess doesn't really want to talk to me so I get a ignition pad

02:49:35.920 --> 02:49:40.480
One of those is mine. I have custody of one of them. They're dead. They're all dead

02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:44.460
That's my Tom Cruise impersonation. Here's your goddamn ferret

02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:52.060
That is all you'll hear it on this show because Jamie's not here

02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:55.880
Yo, they wanted to see it on the cam. Can you put it on the cam?

02:49:56.880 --> 02:49:58.880
All right

02:49:58.880 --> 02:50:05.280
Kamisaki wants to know, so I've always wanted to ask you guys this, if you are called Orange

02:50:05.280 --> 02:50:09.560
Lounge Radio, why don't you just play Orange Lounge Tomosuke songs all day, aside from

02:50:09.560 --> 02:50:12.360
the fact that they'd repeat after an hour or so?

02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:16.400
Well, you hit on the first point, it would get pretty old pretty fast.

02:50:16.400 --> 02:50:21.320
Second reason is when we were picking a name for a station, since we aren't really affiliated

02:50:21.320 --> 02:50:25.760
with any website or anything like that, we're just kind of an upstart thing, we didn't have

02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:26.760
any built-in name.

02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:30.400
So we wanted to pick a name that had something to do with Bomani.

02:50:30.400 --> 02:50:34.120
And Orange Lounge just kind of clicked because, you know, on a radio talk show, what are we

02:50:34.120 --> 02:50:35.120
doing?

02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:36.120
We're sitting around, we're lounging around.

02:50:36.120 --> 02:50:37.120
Get it?

02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:42.640
And Wet Pussy Radio was already taken, so we couldn't use that one either.

02:50:42.640 --> 02:50:43.640
Such a bummer.

02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:44.640
And because that's what we picked!

02:50:44.640 --> 02:50:45.640
So fucking put your word on it!

02:50:45.640 --> 02:50:46.640
I know!

02:50:46.640 --> 02:50:51.360
I wanted to be Wet Pussy Radio really bad, but unfortunately it was taken.

02:50:51.360 --> 02:50:55.480
But for the record, we do play like every single Orange Lounge and Tomosuke-san.

02:50:55.480 --> 02:50:56.540
They're all in rotation.

02:50:56.540 --> 02:51:03.540
orange alarms kicks ass and there's a reason we named the station ever.

02:51:06.660 --> 02:51:12.460
John Fields wants to know, Loki, what's your sim file number at now?

02:51:12.460 --> 02:51:16.540
I don't know because I actually haven't played StepMania in like months, so I have tons of

02:51:16.540 --> 02:51:22.820
them sitting on my hard drive. I just haven't gotten there. I'm probably up to 4,000 now.

02:51:22.820 --> 02:51:33.020
The game sucks, it would be better if it was Gals Panic Radio.

02:51:33.020 --> 02:51:37.700
Go check out Sexy Pachinko Reaction.

02:51:37.700 --> 02:51:41.100
That game is the best freaking hentai arcade game I've ever seen in my life.

02:51:41.100 --> 02:51:42.100
Excellent.

02:51:42.100 --> 02:51:44.100
Sexy Pachinko Reaction.

02:51:44.100 --> 02:51:46.500
That's an awesome radio show name.

02:51:46.500 --> 02:51:47.500
By Sammy.

02:51:47.500 --> 02:51:48.500
Can I get to the rest of the questions, please?

02:51:48.500 --> 02:51:52.460
Beelbo Sammy, the company responsible for?

02:51:52.460 --> 02:51:56.220
No Stylin' Wants to Know.

02:51:56.220 --> 02:52:02.520
When will there be a Loki remix of Mr. Ferrets?

02:52:02.520 --> 02:52:16.520
When will there be a Loki remix of Mr. Ferrets?

02:52:16.520 --> 02:52:24.320
How many listeners do you have listening to Orange Lounge Radio right now?

02:52:24.320 --> 02:52:28.680
How come 23rd Magus has bad jokes?

02:52:28.680 --> 02:52:31.060
How come the sky is blue?

02:52:31.060 --> 02:52:34.260
God made rivers, God made lakes, God made... no, I'm not going to say that.

02:52:34.260 --> 02:52:36.340
That's too mean.

02:52:36.340 --> 02:52:37.460
And I'm nice.

02:52:37.460 --> 02:52:39.140
I'm on nice patrol this week.

02:52:39.140 --> 02:52:41.180
How many stupid rhymes do you know?

02:52:41.180 --> 02:52:42.980
I know a ton!

02:52:42.980 --> 02:52:44.420
In the middle of nowhere.

02:52:44.420 --> 02:52:47.180
I'm smart.

02:52:47.180 --> 02:52:49.540
And well-educated.

02:52:49.540 --> 02:52:51.580
Dark Sakura has another question.

02:52:51.580 --> 02:52:55.060
Dear Orange Lounge, where the fuck did all the generals go on Ragnarok?

02:52:55.060 --> 02:52:57.580
I want to gain another fucking level.

02:52:57.580 --> 02:53:03.460
answer that but I haven't played Ragnarok in about, oh, three months. Does anybody in

02:53:03.460 --> 02:53:08.540
this room play Ragnarok anymore? Never have, never will. I would be if I had money, but

02:53:08.540 --> 02:53:12.860
I have no money. Guess you're fucked! Sorry, Jamie, not only are you sick, but we can't

02:53:12.860 --> 02:53:19.160
answer your question. Boy, are you screwed tonight. Love ya! What? Where are the generals

02:53:49.160 --> 02:53:57.520
in a way cool way man she's super rad what was the pretty bunch thing you just

02:53:57.520 --> 02:54:00.000
did like a square thing with your fingers when you said she's totally not

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:03.640
square that was pretty geeky but it was kind of rounded because I didn't make a

02:54:03.640 --> 02:54:12.160
square it was more rectangular rounded shape maybe some sort of oval she's like

02:54:12.160 --> 02:54:34.160
Sky, what would you do if you had a cute gay guy, a popsicle, and a lot of time in a bedroom?

02:54:34.160 --> 02:54:59.600
I

02:54:59.600 --> 02:55:02.560
What possessed you guys to start a radio station in the first place?

02:55:02.560 --> 02:55:05.760
Were you high on pot or were you just drunk?

02:55:05.760 --> 02:55:06.760
Little bit of both.

02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:11.880
Actually, I had already been doing radio through my buddy's radio station, Undersedation Live,

02:55:11.880 --> 02:55:16.160
and I had been studying radio in college, so it was nothing new to me.

02:55:16.160 --> 02:55:22.800
And Dark Sacra had been guesting on Undersedation Live.

02:55:22.800 --> 02:55:25.600
She did a good job when she did it, so I said, �Hey, Jamie, why don�t we do a show?�

02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:29.320
And she said, �Sure!� And then Loki just started showing up, but it�s worked out

02:55:29.320 --> 02:55:30.320
Nice.

02:55:30.320 --> 02:55:31.320
So...

02:55:31.320 --> 02:55:32.320
I was there.

02:55:32.320 --> 02:55:37.280
Loki just kind of, kind of showed up, and it worked.

02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:42.840
Yes, and Jamie would like to add she was also the most frequent guest on Understation Live,

02:55:42.840 --> 02:55:43.840
which is true.

02:55:43.840 --> 02:55:44.840
All right.

02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:50.640
Biohazard also wants to know, where can I find remixes of Bamani's stuff?

02:55:50.640 --> 02:55:52.240
I'll let Loki answer that.

02:55:52.240 --> 02:55:54.240
The internet.

02:55:54.240 --> 02:55:57.920
You want to be more specific?

02:55:57.920 --> 02:56:05.800
Check out, well, I don't know, check out like BomaniSims if you want shit, but go to like

02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:11.400
Diverse Systems website, they have a lot of like samples you can find.

02:56:11.400 --> 02:56:17.740
Like I believe it's diverse.co.jp if I remember correctly, but if not, just check the link

02:56:17.740 --> 02:56:22.880
on BomaniCell, there should be a link to their site because they're the ones that do bounce

02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:24.920
connected CD.

02:56:24.920 --> 02:56:30.240
So find their site and look for the artist names on there and then when you see the artist

02:56:30.240 --> 02:56:35.280
names like OnoKen for instance, just search under like Yahoo or something for OnoKen then

02:56:35.280 --> 02:56:40.920
BMS because all the people that do remixes on there, they make BMS files for the Beat

02:56:40.920 --> 02:56:44.600
Mania Sims and they do awesome remixes on there.

02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:51.920
That's how I found P8107 without buying the CD is I just rip the sound from the BMS file,

02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:52.920
so.

02:56:52.920 --> 02:57:07.920
That's a good place to look. Just search for like Bimani remixes. You'll also find there's a site that does like a compendium of every single remix ever made and they have it organized by song that it's remixed from and you can find links on there too. So just check that out.

02:57:07.920 --> 02:57:14.920
You can find them on my hard drive. I've got about over 100 of them. Quite a big collection of official ones. But you're not going to have them.

02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:17.920
Here's my clever answer. Listen to Orange Lounge Radio because we play them.

02:57:17.920 --> 02:57:19.920
Yay!

02:57:19.920 --> 02:57:23.880
Why do you keep saying you are going to burn the ferrets and you don't?

02:57:23.880 --> 02:57:28.000
Are you not able to bring yourself to set aflame, the Orange Laundry radio mascot?

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:32.920
Basically, if I burn the ferrets, Jamie would kick my ass, and I know this.

02:57:32.920 --> 02:57:36.440
But I'm hoping when she goes away to Alabama, she'll be gone for a good two weeks.

02:57:36.440 --> 02:57:40.480
So if I set them on fire just before she leaves, she'll have the whole trip to kind of calm

02:57:40.480 --> 02:57:42.800
down, and I'm hoping she'll forget by the time she gets back.

02:57:42.800 --> 02:57:44.600
So have a nice trip, Jamie!

02:57:44.600 --> 02:57:48.280
Also, because one of them isn't yours, and so you don't want to burn other people's stuff.

02:57:48.280 --> 02:57:56.080
I would just say, you know, I'm sorry, I thought you had fire insurance.

02:57:56.080 --> 02:57:59.000
For the good of all radio, I will set it on fire.

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:03.700
Fire, fire will retard or whatever, yeah, I'm tired.

02:58:03.700 --> 02:58:07.440
Next question, Ask Orange Lounge, we're gonna finish this up and then end the show, we gotta

02:58:07.440 --> 02:58:12.400
zip through these because there's only like one minute supposedly left in the show.

02:58:12.400 --> 02:58:17.240
Why did the chicken know, wait, where did you get that Mobomoga remix you hear in the

02:58:17.240 --> 02:58:24.240
orange lounge radio intro.

02:58:47.240 --> 02:58:52.840
Hamster Alliance is what he goes by online.

02:58:52.840 --> 02:58:57.000
Navi was urging him to create a Bimani remix for a Bimani-style remix contest that they

02:58:57.000 --> 02:59:01.360
had a while back, and he doesn't really like many Bimani songs, so it was a problem.

02:59:01.360 --> 02:59:05.460
Mogomogas is probably his favorite song out of all of them, and he pretty much remixed

02:59:05.460 --> 02:59:09.160
those 20 seconds and then said, ah, fuck it, which is too bad, because if he had remixed

02:59:09.160 --> 02:59:10.160
the whole thing...

02:59:10.160 --> 02:59:11.240
Best remix I've ever heard.

02:59:11.240 --> 02:59:12.600
He probably would have won the whole damn thing.

02:59:12.600 --> 02:59:15.680
If he would have remixed more Bimani stuff, he'd have more of a mind to it.

02:59:15.680 --> 02:59:16.680
Fuck.

02:59:16.680 --> 02:59:19.400
He is so talented.

02:59:19.400 --> 02:59:20.400
His music is great.

02:59:20.400 --> 02:59:21.400
Check out his website.

02:59:21.400 --> 02:59:25.960
I just don't know what it is, but search for that name, Hamster Alliance.

02:59:25.960 --> 02:59:35.080
The E at the end of Hamster, I believe, is a three, if you can't find it under Hamster.

02:59:35.080 --> 02:59:39.240
The nice thing is, I asked him when he didn't end up entering it in the contest, but I heard

02:59:39.240 --> 02:59:40.240
it anyway.

02:59:40.240 --> 02:59:44.640
I asked him, I'm like, hey, I run a station called Orange Lounge Radio with some friends.

02:59:44.640 --> 02:59:45.960
Maybe we could use that.

02:59:45.960 --> 02:59:46.960
He's like, yeah, sure.

02:59:46.960 --> 02:59:47.960
So, there you go.

02:59:47.960 --> 02:59:52.480
Just that, whatever, how many 15 seconds you've got of it, it's like just that 15 seconds

02:59:52.480 --> 02:59:55.800
is already the best remix I've ever heard, ever.

02:59:55.800 --> 02:59:57.120
Yeah, huh?

02:59:57.120 --> 02:59:58.880
It's so good.

02:59:58.880 --> 03:00:03.280
It sounds like Crystal Method remixes, that's what I like.

03:00:03.280 --> 03:00:04.280
All right.

03:00:04.280 --> 03:00:08.080
We're running a little over here, but I want to address the rest of these questions.

03:00:08.080 --> 03:00:13.140
Anybody have info on the StepMania SM Max 4 theme that I haven't heard about for a long

03:00:13.140 --> 03:00:14.140
time?

03:00:44.140 --> 03:00:45.620
two more here.

03:00:45.620 --> 03:00:49.460
Biohazard also wants to know, why does the webcam face a very uninteresting area of your

03:00:49.460 --> 03:00:50.460
living room?

03:00:50.460 --> 03:00:52.340
Well, you know what?

03:00:52.340 --> 03:00:53.340
There is no interesting area.

03:00:53.340 --> 03:00:54.340
Surprise!

03:00:54.340 --> 03:00:55.340
There is no interesting area.

03:00:55.340 --> 03:00:56.340
I know.

03:00:56.340 --> 03:00:57.340
So what do you expect?

03:00:57.340 --> 03:00:59.580
Well, I could open the fridge and get the camera in the fridge.

03:00:59.580 --> 03:01:00.580
That would be cool.

03:01:00.580 --> 03:01:02.580
And then you would just see this be cool.

03:01:02.580 --> 03:01:05.580
That would be cool.

03:01:05.580 --> 03:01:08.100
All right.

03:01:08.100 --> 03:01:09.100
Last question.

03:01:09.100 --> 03:01:12.580
Sorry guys that sent their questions in late, but we're running over here.

03:01:12.580 --> 03:01:14.900
Biohazard wants to know, why did you pick Live 365

03:01:14.900 --> 03:01:17.820
to host your station and not some other place?

03:01:17.820 --> 03:01:21.500
Basically, because Live 365 will pay all the licensing for you

03:01:21.500 --> 03:01:22.460
as well.

03:01:22.460 --> 03:01:27.060
And although I would be willing to run a shoutcast station,

03:01:27.060 --> 03:01:29.620
it's just not possible because of our bandwidth.

03:01:29.620 --> 03:01:32.020
Believe it or not, we have too many listeners,

03:01:32.020 --> 03:01:34.060
and we wouldn't be able to maintain

03:01:34.060 --> 03:01:36.300
the bandwidth for the live show.

03:01:36.300 --> 03:01:37.940
We wouldn't be able to do it.

03:01:37.940 --> 03:01:40.940
So sorry, we're kind of stuck with Live 365.

03:01:40.940 --> 03:01:46.180
Although honestly, they're not bad because despite you guys get pop-up ads and all that

03:01:46.180 --> 03:01:50.220
stuff, considering everything you get, which is licensed, paid for, radio, if you want

03:01:50.220 --> 03:01:54.140
to blame somebody for the fact that Lie365 has to have all these pop-ups, blame the RIAA

03:01:54.140 --> 03:01:57.780
for enacting those licensing laws and all that shit.

03:01:57.780 --> 03:01:59.260
That's who's fault it is, not Lie365.

03:01:59.260 --> 03:02:02.060
They do the best they can and I've been happy with them this far.

03:02:32.060 --> 03:02:39.060
the

03:02:39.060 --> 03:02:46.060
the

03:02:48.580 --> 03:02:55.100
uh... times for everybody's final thoughts as time to wrap up the dam show

03:02:55.100 --> 03:02:55.980
brad

03:02:55.980 --> 03:02:57.040
final thought

03:02:57.040 --> 03:03:01.180
he said he did look so good

03:03:01.180 --> 03:03:02.580
was my before my mom

03:03:02.580 --> 03:03:08.940
My other final thought is you smell like butt.

03:03:08.940 --> 03:03:15.380
Bradley Gotta get up, gotta get moving.

03:03:15.380 --> 03:03:19.500
You sound like an 80's theme song right there, thank you.

03:03:19.500 --> 03:03:27.640
Loki I know I have to drink Therafloot, but lemon

03:03:57.640 --> 03:03:58.640
That's it.

03:03:58.640 --> 03:04:01.680
Thank you everybody for listening and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

03:04:01.680 --> 03:04:04.060
We do appreciate it.

03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:15.760
All your favorite DDR, 2DX, and Dance Media favorites.

03:04:15.760 --> 03:04:17.600
And thanks for your support.

03:04:17.600 --> 03:04:18.600
We always appreciate it.

03:04:18.600 --> 03:04:19.600
The final word of the show.

03:04:19.600 --> 03:04:21.520
Loki, I don't think you've ever had it.

03:04:21.520 --> 03:04:22.520
What do you want?

03:04:22.520 --> 03:04:24.520
Final word of the show.

03:04:24.520 --> 03:04:31.520
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura,

03:04:33.040 --> 03:04:39.040
Skye and Loki. We expect you a nice play again. And now, here's your fortune cookie message

03:04:39.040 --> 03:04:40.040
of the day.

03:04:40.040 --> 03:04:47.040
Well, as Megatron has, how shall we say, departed, I nominate myself as the new leader.

03:04:47.040 --> 03:04:51.040
I nominate myself as the new leader!

03:04:51.040 --> 03:04:57.040
Wait! The Constructicons form Devastator, the most powerful robot we should rule!

03:04:57.040 --> 03:05:01.040
Soundwave superior, Constructicons inferior.

03:05:01.040 --> 03:05:04.040
Who are you calling inferior?

03:05:04.040 --> 03:05:07.040
Nobody would follow an uncharismatic bore like you!

03:05:07.040 --> 03:05:11.040
Hey! Nobody calls Soundwave uncrasmatic!

03:05:11.040 --> 03:05:13.320
Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week
