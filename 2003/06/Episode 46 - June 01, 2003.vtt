WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty talks and then some.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Yes, I will spank your child.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Well, here's my big opening.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
A sphincter says what?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
I'm super. Thanks for asking.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
What am I doing here?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
No.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Dodge this.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Mm-hmm. This is a tasty burger.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Look, you stupid bastard. You've got no arms left.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Yes, I have. Look.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Just a flesh wound.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Searching for a boy in high school is useless.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
It's searching for meaning in a polyshorn way.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
Oh, yeah? Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Dark Sakura.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Loki.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I hate you!

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Oh, the fighting's already begun.

01:35.000 --> 01:43.000

Orange Lounge Radio is proud to present a celebrity interview.

09:39.760 --> 09:41.760
Can you introduce yourself for our listeners?

09:41.760 --> 09:43.760

09:43.760 --> 09:45.760
Oh, it's great to have you on the show today.

09:45.760 --> 09:46.760
Hello, how are you today?

09:46.760 --> 09:48.760
I'm great, thanks.

09:48.760 --> 09:49.760
Did you have a question?

09:49.760 --> 09:51.760
Well, yes, actually I wanted to know...

09:51.760 --> 09:55.760
Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please?

09:55.760 --> 10:01.760
Uh, well, no, I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.

10:01.760 --> 10:02.760
Alright, go ahead.

10:02.760 --> 10:06.360
Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?

10:06.360 --> 10:07.760
Is he incarcerated?

10:07.760 --> 10:11.760
Uh, actually, no he's not, but what do you think of the ever-ranty Dark Zakra?

10:11.760 --> 10:13.360
Hi, dear, how are you?

10:13.360 --> 10:14.560
I love you.

10:14.560 --> 10:17.760
I see you two must know each other. Well, what do you think of Skye?

10:17.760 --> 10:19.960
Did he used to play football when he was in high school?

10:19.960 --> 10:21.560
Well, actually, no he didn't.

10:21.560 --> 10:22.560
Ha ha ha ha!

10:22.560 --> 10:24.760
Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?

10:24.760 --> 10:28.560
I want you to really remember the pill, alright?

10:28.560 --> 10:34.560
I'm seeing some forgetting possibly, and I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.

10:34.560 --> 10:38.560
Right, okay, well thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.

10:38.560 --> 10:41.560
Um, I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but...

10:41.560 --> 10:47.560
Who are all of these nosy people, outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card?

10:47.560 --> 10:48.560
Get away from me!

10:48.560 --> 10:49.560
Ha ha ha!

10:50.560 --> 10:55.560
Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.920
I'm miss Cleo. I love you

11:04.040 --> 11:06.040
Wait, sorry, we are muted. Hi, welcome back

11:09.320 --> 11:11.320
You are assisting the orange lounge radio

11:12.540 --> 11:14.540
episode number 46

11:14.680 --> 11:16.940
I still have SARS. This is bad

11:19.020 --> 11:22.920
This is very bad that I'm still sick after so much allergy

11:22.920 --> 11:29.140
It's not sick. It's the allergies. No, it's not allergies. I swear. It's the sick of the air. I think I have a brain tumor

11:33.300 --> 11:37.860
No, seriously like my head hurts like right up around here, it's not like a headache

11:37.860 --> 11:42.820
I'll hit you somewhere else in your head and you won't hurt anyone. It's really filthy get away from me. Oh

11:44.240 --> 11:47.460
My god you put the hat on Cartman. Yes, I did

11:47.460 --> 11:48.460
Good.

11:48.460 --> 11:49.460
God, you're a freak.

11:49.460 --> 11:52.460
Anyway, oh yes, my brain tumor.

11:52.460 --> 11:55.300
Oh, and about that tumor.

11:55.300 --> 11:58.100
I seriously think, okay, I think the other night while I was sleeping or something I

11:58.100 --> 12:00.900
must have like banged my head against the wall repeatedly because it feels like I have

12:00.900 --> 12:01.900
a bruise.

12:01.900 --> 12:02.900
Irene, look.

12:02.900 --> 12:03.900
Do I have a bruise like right here?

12:03.900 --> 12:04.900
It really hurts.

12:04.900 --> 12:05.900
That's really good radio.

12:05.900 --> 12:09.580
If it's not a tumor, then I swear it's like, I don't know.

12:09.580 --> 12:13.060
By the way, you know what you didn't do last week even though I burned them for you?

12:13.060 --> 12:14.060
What?

12:14.060 --> 12:15.900
Those night style songs from the Tesla occasion.

12:15.900 --> 12:16.900
Oh, you're right.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.900
You know, we re-burned them.

12:18.900 --> 12:22.900
Oh, you did. Well, I played some of them a few weeks ago, but, you know, we can play some-

12:22.900 --> 12:24.900
Those are ones that you didn't have.

12:24.900 --> 12:26.900
We'll do some Mind Style songs the next break.

12:26.900 --> 12:27.900
Aha.

12:27.900 --> 12:29.900
They're kinda crappy.

12:29.900 --> 12:31.900
That's what the quality is, anyway.

12:31.900 --> 12:32.900
I'd like to- Excuse me.

12:32.900 --> 12:34.900
Okay, Kermit.

12:34.900 --> 12:36.900
Hi, Ho.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.900
What are you talking about, bitch?

12:38.900 --> 12:40.900
Just kidding.

12:40.900 --> 12:46.900
I like to apologize to Maren-chan right off the bat because I gave her SARS when she was here last week. I'm really sorry.

12:47.900 --> 12:48.900
If she's listening?

12:49.920 --> 12:51.900
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

12:52.900 --> 12:54.900
You're talking more pain.

12:54.920 --> 12:58.920
Loki is talking about causing pain to the masses and things like that.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.960
What else?

13:00.960 --> 13:01.960
Oh, yeah, my brain tumor.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.940
Now, it's really weird. Now, it's in my ear.

13:04.940 --> 13:06.940
And my ear tumor?

13:06.940 --> 13:08.900
Maybe I'm thinking I have an ear infection.

13:08.900 --> 13:09.900
But then, sorry what was that?

13:09.900 --> 13:10.900
Robbie, we need to go to Walmart and get you a new head.

13:10.900 --> 13:11.900
I say I mean, Robbie's head.

13:11.900 --> 13:12.900
Whoa, wait til Brad gets here, okay?

13:12.900 --> 13:27.500
It kind of reminds me, you remember, and I can make this Balmani related, do you remember

13:27.500 --> 13:36.080
in Max PC, or I'm sorry Max PC, do you remember Jason Enos' character?

13:36.080 --> 13:40.880
like the head was really small than the rest of the body it made it look like it

13:40.880 --> 13:44.180
looked like it reminded me of that scene from return to Oz where the witch like

13:44.180 --> 13:47.780
had all the heads in a jar and like she could take into it because the head

13:47.780 --> 13:53.900
looked faked it looked like it was just like screwed on yeah return to Oz was an

13:53.900 --> 13:58.520
awesome movie good reference I liked it because it was like just like the book

13:58.520 --> 14:01.740
you know what I think we need to do on orange hans radio some night see if this

14:01.740 --> 14:08.520
is a rating success or a ratings disaster, because we have this neat new mixing board,

14:08.520 --> 14:12.780
we can loop in the TV, so we should watch a movie and comment along with it. It'll be

14:12.780 --> 14:18.780
like Mystery Science Theater on the radio. We need to watch Reading Rainbow. I am so

14:18.780 --> 14:25.780
sad. You can't AP Reading Rainbow. I am sad. Why? About them not having any more money

14:26.620 --> 14:31.380
to do more Reading Rainbow. They haven't cancelled Reading Rainbow yet. Yeah, but they can only

14:31.380 --> 14:35.480
do what, four shows a year? I know, it's sad. This sucks. They better not cancel Reading

14:35.480 --> 14:40.580
Rainbow. What will LeVar Burton do? Oh my god, LeVar Burton will like have to retire

14:40.580 --> 14:45.240
because he's got. But he's a certified genius, he can get, they'll pay him for being smart.

14:45.240 --> 14:48.960
You know what I saw on Game Show Network the other day? I saw The Weakest Link, Star Trek

14:48.960 --> 14:55.020
edition. That was great. And he won. Well yeah, he's like an actual, isn't he, what's

14:55.020 --> 15:02.020
And not only did he win, he got like the highest jackpot in that game's history up to that

15:03.020 --> 15:07.020
point or something like that. Isn't that fabulous?

15:07.020 --> 15:11.020
This is really smart. I enjoy hearing about smart people because the world is mostly full

15:11.020 --> 15:18.020
of idiots. Smart people bring a smile to my face. I'm just as much as seeing idiots die

15:18.020 --> 15:23.020
smile to my face. I'm just as much as seeing idiots, you know, die violent, horrible, bloody

15:23.020 --> 15:26.820
deaths. Do you have any fun idiot watching stories to tell this week? Have you been out

15:26.820 --> 15:31.500
to the various arcades and seen any idiots? Just been driving on the road, plenty of idiots

15:31.500 --> 15:35.280
there. And I was at the mall today, you know, good figure. Oh, how was the rest of your

15:35.280 --> 15:41.680
day with Sharks Girl and Mel B, who were in town today? Well, you were there for Mango

15:41.680 --> 15:45.700
Chow. Right, I was there for Mango Chow. And then we decided that we were going to go to

15:45.700 --> 15:50.300
the idiot mecca of Sacramento, which is Ardent Fair Mall, and of course there's also the

15:50.300 --> 15:53.220
idiot mecca of Roseville, which is in the Galleria.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.780
What about Golfland?

15:54.780 --> 15:56.300
That's just like the retard mecca.

15:56.300 --> 15:59.020
There's a difference between idiots and retarded people.

15:59.020 --> 16:03.380
Of course, calling that the retard mecca would probably insult retarded people everywhere.

16:03.380 --> 16:04.380
Okay.

16:04.380 --> 16:08.180
Anyway, there were lots of stupid people everywhere and they were all driving and they were in

16:08.180 --> 16:12.320
the parking garage and we found like a really nice parking spot because it was in the second

16:12.320 --> 16:19.060
level of the garage by Sears so it was all shady and this is still hot and the hot sucks

16:19.060 --> 16:22.820
and then all the expresses everywhere are closed everywhere.

16:22.820 --> 16:23.820
The stores?

16:23.820 --> 16:24.820
Yeah.

16:24.820 --> 16:25.820
Why?

16:25.820 --> 16:26.820
Because they're remodeling or something.

16:26.820 --> 16:27.820
That sucks.

16:27.820 --> 16:28.820
She came all the way out here.

16:28.820 --> 16:29.820
She started wasting her trip completely?

16:29.820 --> 16:31.820
Well no, because she got something at Hot Topic.

16:31.820 --> 16:34.820
She got a big, floppy, fuzzy black hat.

16:34.820 --> 16:35.820
Whoa.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.580
It's a hat.

16:38.580 --> 16:39.580
Sounds kind of kinky.

16:39.580 --> 16:40.580
It's a hat.

16:40.580 --> 16:45.580
And we went to Torrid, I know it's not a kinky hat, it's a cute hat.

16:45.580 --> 16:50.580
Then we went to Torrid, and I looked at clothes I can't buy yet because I haven't gotten paid.

16:50.580 --> 16:53.580
And then we listened to Strong Bad on the way home.

16:53.580 --> 16:57.580
Then we went to Scandia, ran into DJ Syndrome, and ran into...

16:57.580 --> 16:59.580
We need to get him on the show some night.

16:59.580 --> 17:02.580
We ran into Ryan, some name I guess.

17:02.580 --> 17:03.580
We need to get him back on the show some night.

17:03.580 --> 17:06.580
I know, because he's been falling off the face of the earth.

17:06.580 --> 17:08.580
No kidding, and where's Intern Zero?

17:08.580 --> 17:10.580
Intern Zero is probably working.

17:10.580 --> 17:11.080
Oh, that's true.

17:11.080 --> 17:12.580
Because remember, he works for my man now.

17:12.580 --> 17:13.080
That's right.

17:13.080 --> 17:15.080
He is now indirectly my bitch.

17:18.080 --> 17:21.580
In all of these celebrity interviews that we'll be doing in future weeks,

17:21.580 --> 17:23.580
you know, we'll always ask about Intern Zero

17:23.580 --> 17:25.580
because we're always curious about, you know,

17:25.580 --> 17:27.580
what the celebrities think of our intern.

17:27.580 --> 17:31.580
Because we're very privileged to have Intern Zero on board here.

17:31.580 --> 17:35.580
Well, it's, you know, we have a very privileged group

17:35.580 --> 17:40.260
You know, we need to not forget about our foreign correspondent from the People's Republic

17:40.260 --> 17:43.060
of Davis, Abed N'Hilpa'i, who entered here TM.

17:43.060 --> 17:45.500
Yeah, we need to get Puppy back on the show too.

17:45.500 --> 17:51.780
Puppy, get your ass back out here, now, or we spank you with a roll-up newspaper.

17:51.780 --> 17:55.660
I'm waiting for the big sniff in the chat room.

17:55.660 --> 18:02.660
Oh, if you want to join our chat room, head on over to www.calibomani.com, click on Orange

18:02.660 --> 18:09.660
lounge and then click on chat. And then you can chat with our chatters in the chat room.

18:09.660 --> 18:14.140
I feel really irresponsible because we're supposed to be working on the battle royale

18:14.140 --> 18:21.140
plane instead of playing Ragnarok. Ha! I am so glad that it's gone pay to play.

18:22.380 --> 18:27.100
I am seriously thinking of starting Ragnarok now because like I was watching Brad play

18:27.100 --> 18:30.340
the other night it was comedy gold. Isn't it great?

18:30.340 --> 18:34.320
tell your Ragnarok story first? Okay, they went pay to play, which is the best thing

18:34.320 --> 18:38.500
that could have ever happened. I mean, true, I'm going to have friends who I used to, who

18:38.500 --> 18:43.360
helped me level and get where I am today, character-wise, who are not going to pay to

18:43.360 --> 18:49.720
play. But like, one friend gave me, um, like, 250,000 zenny, which was a lot of the money

18:49.720 --> 18:55.480
in the game. So I went out and bought a bunch of armor. And now my character's badass. And

18:55.480 --> 18:59.060
And on top of that, since they introduced the Pay to Play, like today's the actual day

18:59.060 --> 19:08.500
it starts, the server congestion went from about 13,000 people logged in to 6,500, right

19:08.500 --> 19:09.500
around there.

19:09.500 --> 19:10.500
Therefore, there's no lag.

19:10.500 --> 19:15.100
All of you people who decided to quit, thank you.

19:15.100 --> 19:16.100
I love you.

19:16.100 --> 19:20.100
Let's see, I'm thinking about starting to join now after watching Brad play the other

19:20.100 --> 19:21.100
day.

19:21.100 --> 19:22.100
That's fine.

19:22.100 --> 19:24.860
Now, you and Brad play on different servers though, so can you move your character from

19:24.860 --> 19:25.860
one server to another?

19:25.860 --> 19:26.860
Nope.

19:26.860 --> 19:27.860
You'll lose everything.

19:27.860 --> 19:28.860
That's ass.

19:28.860 --> 19:29.860
That is so ass.

19:29.860 --> 19:30.860
But you can make two characters, one on each server.

19:30.860 --> 19:31.860
That might work.

19:31.860 --> 19:33.860
But you have to play on Chaos with me.

19:33.860 --> 19:37.860
Okay, but if I do it, if, if, I still have to cancel my PSO account first because I don't

19:37.860 --> 19:38.860
play PSO at all.

19:38.860 --> 19:39.860
But mine was already cancelled, believe it or not.

19:39.860 --> 19:40.860
Really?

19:40.860 --> 19:41.860
I didn't even know mine was cancelled.

19:41.860 --> 19:49.020
I looked up my stuff on, um, if you go to Sega.com slash PSO underscore GCN.

19:49.020 --> 19:51.340
I wonder if they just cancel you automatically if you don't play.

19:51.340 --> 19:53.420
Bless their little hearts if that's what they do.

19:53.420 --> 19:59.100
They keep your information there in case you want to start back up, but I might start PSO

19:59.100 --> 20:05.020
back up later, but for right now I've just been, that's been my, you know, I'll play

20:05.020 --> 20:08.660
then I'll like let my character sit and heal while I go off and do other stuff.

20:08.660 --> 20:11.620
Maren has given us the Ragnarok report.

20:11.620 --> 20:15.260
There is currently 3,800 people logged into Chaos.

20:15.260 --> 20:16.260
Thank you.

20:16.260 --> 20:27.260
And see, I'm so glad that she's paying to play too, because then I get my sauce on Ragnorock with me, and I have 50 fire arrows for you.

20:27.260 --> 20:41.260
Okay, for those that don't play Ragnorock online, you visit the website www.ragnarockonline.com

20:41.260 --> 20:44.260
Excellent. Maybe somebody in the chat room will be so kind as to post a link.

20:44.260 --> 20:50.260
And it's $12 a month unless you do pay by cash, then it's a little bit more because of the service charge.

20:50.260 --> 20:56.260
But it's not continuously updating your pay, so you have to pay every month manually.

20:56.260 --> 21:01.260
Even so, you can pay up to six months in advance.

21:01.260 --> 21:08.260
I paid three. It's a little bit cheaper to pay three months or six months in advance, but I paid three months in advance.

21:08.260 --> 21:13.260
And if you want to find me on there, my username is Sorato. It's the only one I have.

21:13.260 --> 21:18.060
So what's the game like? It's kind of like the best way I can describe it is kind of like a multiplayer Secret of Mana.

21:18.060 --> 21:21.820
Yeah, it's like playing Secret of Mana, you have your individual character.

21:21.820 --> 21:24.980
You can form a party, you can share experience,

21:24.980 --> 21:29.180
which is really good if you're all trying to get levels quickly because then

21:29.180 --> 21:32.420
every time you fight something you'll all gain levels together.

21:32.420 --> 21:39.180
You can buy stuff, upgrade your armor, you can make your own quest.

21:39.180 --> 21:42.340
There's also bosses hidden in the game

21:42.340 --> 21:47.340
Where you and a billion other people can just like tag team and like rape this guy.

21:47.340 --> 21:53.340
Whoa! Tag team raping only on Ragnarok Online.

21:53.340 --> 21:55.340
Like the Troll King or something.

21:55.340 --> 21:58.340
In the chat room RiceRYC3 says,

21:58.340 --> 22:00.340
It's like Diablo 2 but cuter.

22:00.340 --> 22:03.340
I've been hearing it's not like Ultima. Ultima Online.

22:03.340 --> 22:04.340
Oh, I never did play that.

22:04.340 --> 22:06.340
It's all point and click killing stuff.

22:06.340 --> 22:09.340
Let me tell my funny because I was watching, or actually it's really Brad's funny.

22:09.340 --> 22:14.220
I was watching Brad play the other day, and I guess he was talking about this guy who

22:14.220 --> 22:17.940
was, you know, because of the server changes, a lot of people, or the fact that they're

22:17.940 --> 22:20.900
going pay-to-play, there was a lot of people giving shit away on there.

22:20.900 --> 22:24.580
So there was this guy, and he stood there, he said, I'm gonna give away my armor, and

22:24.580 --> 22:27.500
it's like this super rare armor, he says, I'm gonna give away my armor in ten minutes,

22:27.500 --> 22:28.500
I'll be right back.

22:28.500 --> 22:32.020
So he, you know, he says that, and then all these people just start crowding around him,

22:32.020 --> 22:33.020
like tons and tons of people.

22:33.020 --> 22:35.020
He's probably got lots of whispers.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.980
Tons, I don't, I mean, just masses of people around him.

22:37.980 --> 22:41.980
And then after 10 minutes of his up, he goes, just kidding, and runs away.

22:41.980 --> 22:50.260
There was a guy in there, who kept dropping cards and then picking them up.

22:50.260 --> 22:53.740
And then he's like, I'm going to drop all my cards, because cards are like, they're

22:53.740 --> 22:56.900
a one in one million item or something that you can fit.

22:56.900 --> 22:59.500
I think I've got like a bajillion of them.

22:59.500 --> 23:03.820
Anyway, he says he's going to give away all of his cards, and so he drops one card, which

23:03.820 --> 23:08.060
is like a pouring card which is like this little pink bubble thing which is the weakest

23:08.060 --> 23:09.540
character in the game.

23:09.540 --> 23:16.020
And then he starts dropping like twigs, branches, flowers, which are all like little crap stuff.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.740
Awesome.

23:17.740 --> 23:21.320
The other thing I watched Brad do, oh I actually suggest this because this is the crazy thing

23:21.320 --> 23:26.580
about Ragnarok Online is that when you go into the towns, there's just masses of people

23:26.580 --> 23:27.580
there.

23:27.580 --> 23:29.100
Hi, we're AFK and clogging the server.

23:29.100 --> 23:32.980
Oh my god, there's just people just standing there in the middle of the town.

23:32.980 --> 23:35.620
It looks like China in there, I swear to God.

23:35.620 --> 23:38.020
Hey, and you can get flu masks in the game.

23:38.020 --> 23:40.220
You can buy yourself one from Ragnarok.

23:40.220 --> 23:42.660
I swear to God, Ragnarok online looks like China.

23:42.660 --> 23:46.420
So you go into the middle of the street or whatever, so I told Brad, hey, there's that

23:46.420 --> 23:48.680
big clusterfuck of people standing in the middle of the screen.

23:48.680 --> 23:52.700
Go run around him and go, I have SARS, cough, cough, cough.

23:52.700 --> 23:53.700
So he did it.

23:53.700 --> 23:57.540
He ran in, he ran in the middle of the group, and he's all, I have SARS, cough, cough, cough.

23:57.540 --> 24:01.780
Literally the second after he did that, someone summoned a monster into town that just started

24:01.780 --> 24:05.860
running around killing all the people that were idling. It was great. And Brad's like,

24:05.860 --> 24:10.980
gotta go! This is great though because people have been protesting the charge, which is

24:10.980 --> 24:15.460
I think so retarded, because they knew from the beginning that the whole reason that they

24:15.460 --> 24:21.460
were beta-testing us is that you would eventually pay for the service. So this is great. And

24:21.460 --> 24:26.460
for all you people who play, I don't know if they still have it up, but this is hilarious.

24:26.460 --> 24:31.500
There's a warp, and the phone's ringing, there's a warp. We can't take phone calls on the show

24:31.500 --> 24:37.500
On the south gate of Ponteira, which is like the middle town, and uh...

24:41.500 --> 24:43.500
Oh, stop picking it up.

24:43.500 --> 24:44.500
What?

24:44.500 --> 24:45.500
It's spam.

24:45.500 --> 24:46.500
Oh, it's spam?

24:46.500 --> 24:47.500
Yeah.

24:47.500 --> 24:50.500
Do not ruin this show to bring us spam!

24:50.500 --> 24:55.500
Hand, hand, hand, hey, hand, hey, hand, hey.

24:55.500 --> 24:58.500
That could have been the most important call of my life, according to that.

24:58.500 --> 25:00.500
Hand, come here.

25:00.500 --> 25:12.820
They set up a warp right in the south gate of town, so if you leave town, you go into

25:12.820 --> 25:18.460
this warp, and the warp shoots you to the Christmas village.

25:18.460 --> 25:21.100
Everybody is trapped in a corral with no way out.

25:21.100 --> 25:22.100
That's right.

25:22.100 --> 25:26.500
So the only way you can get out is to use something called a fly wing, which will teleport

25:26.500 --> 25:28.500
you to another part of town.

25:28.500 --> 25:34.740
Luckily for me, I had a fly wing, so I go to the other part of town, and they're like,

25:34.740 --> 25:40.180
let us out! Let us out! And I was like, ah! And then I got killed. And then I went back

25:40.180 --> 25:45.300
there. And like, if you leave there, you have to dodge abominable snowmans and things, and

25:45.300 --> 25:49.660
they're aggressive, so they chase you. But I have high agility, so I run away.

25:49.660 --> 25:53.500
This is a fun topic. I want to solicit stories from the chat room. If anybody has any funny

25:53.500 --> 25:58.100
online game stories, this is really nerdy, but it can be funny. If anybody has any really

25:58.100 --> 26:01.340
good online game stories that are funny, send them to me in private message in the chatroom.

26:01.340 --> 26:04.660
Well, this is the part that sucks. The only way out of the Christmas village,

26:04.660 --> 26:09.020
besides warping, is going to the south, to warp past all the aggressive creatures.

26:09.020 --> 26:12.300
It takes you to a city called Aldebaran, which is like way in the north.

26:12.300 --> 26:16.340
The only way to get out of that town is to walk past three screens full of aggressive

26:16.340 --> 26:16.860
creatures

26:16.860 --> 26:21.580
that will kill me in two hits. And I made it out.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.220
I was happy.

26:24.220 --> 26:28.060
The wizards or whatever, weren't they the ones that were like, you have to pay me to get out of here

26:28.060 --> 26:31.760
And I can work you out. Yeah, they have the ability to warping and some of them in the game

26:31.980 --> 26:34.340
They're just like may I have the hill please not heal you

26:34.660 --> 26:35.700
I'm like hey cool

26:35.700 --> 26:41.540
and I ran into a swordman with sword sword ease are cool to hang out with because I like kill stuff for you if

26:42.040 --> 26:43.680
You're low-level they like kill stuff

26:43.680 --> 26:46.040
Then they'll let you tank on them which tanking means

26:46.260 --> 26:51.220
they'll attack a creature once so that the creature keeps hitting them over and over and you can kill the creature and get the

26:51.340 --> 26:53.140
experience from it and

26:53.140 --> 26:54.420
so I

26:54.420 --> 26:57.420
I hung out with one who killed a bunch of people for me and then they left.

26:58.420 --> 27:01.420
Aww. Does Ragnarok still have really bad Engrish?

27:01.420 --> 27:05.420
Yes, it's beautiful. It's like, it's core Engrish.

27:06.420 --> 27:07.420
Cause remember it's Korean.

27:10.420 --> 27:14.420
Okay, so I'm gonna shift gears and talk about a different online game that we brought up earlier, PSO.

27:14.420 --> 27:19.420
I think I mentioned this on a previous show, but I'll tell you the funniest thing I've ever seen in PSO.

27:19.420 --> 27:20.420
and PSO.

27:20.420 --> 27:22.260
I don't know, were you there, Loki, when I was watching this?

27:22.260 --> 27:26.780
I went into a server once, I went into a PSO server, and the way Phantasy Star Online looks,

27:26.780 --> 27:29.820
it's kind of like a 3D Diablo II.

27:29.820 --> 27:32.100
That's really the most elementary way of putting it.

27:32.100 --> 27:34.820
You know, it probably doesn't do the game justice, but I'm just going to say it, it's

27:34.820 --> 27:35.820
a 3D Diablo II.

27:35.820 --> 27:39.820
So you go into the server room, which is like this giant circle, and you know, there are

27:39.820 --> 27:43.740
all these people standing there, and then one guy decides to just start running laps

27:43.740 --> 27:44.740
around the room.

27:44.740 --> 27:48.940
He's just running around in a giant circle, and everybody, you actually can see like everybody

27:48.940 --> 27:53.660
watching him as he's running around the circle on the screen and people are like going what

27:53.660 --> 27:57.620
the hell and then suddenly a couple other guys decide to join him and they all start

27:57.620 --> 28:01.420
running around in the circle and then suddenly like the entire server room is doing a big

28:01.420 --> 28:03.180
conga line around the server.

28:03.180 --> 28:05.460
It was the gayest thing ever but it was so funny.

28:05.460 --> 28:07.540
I'm going to send some pictures for next week.

28:07.540 --> 28:11.820
I have pictures because every so often I'll say the screen capture for when I'm playing

28:11.820 --> 28:12.820
Ragnarok.

28:12.820 --> 28:18.180
I have a picture of this place in the desert town where I was getting my weapons upgraded

28:18.180 --> 28:21.900
and some friends met me there and then random people were there and we all formed a conga

28:21.900 --> 28:26.020
line StableRx has an interesting story to share

28:26.020 --> 28:30.780
here in our chat room. He says my friend Chris made a female account and as soon as he logged

28:30.780 --> 28:35.060
in a guy started flirting with him. He kept stalking him until he logged out and he never

28:35.060 --> 28:39.900
used the account again. Do you ever find yourself getting hit on as a female game player?

28:39.900 --> 28:44.980
All the time but it's a good thing because they give me stuff.

28:44.980 --> 28:47.020
I have a story.

28:47.020 --> 28:52.660
We played, well this was back when Ultima Online was first getting started and we were

28:52.660 --> 28:56.980
just being really stupid so what we did was we stripped our character of all of his clothes

28:56.980 --> 29:02.340
and just said he got player killed and kept begging for stuff from people and the player's

29:02.340 --> 29:04.540
name was Italian Sausage.

29:04.540 --> 29:10.380
And so we were just running around yelling sausage for sale and just being like really

29:10.380 --> 29:11.380
annoying.

29:11.380 --> 29:12.380
Wait what game was this?

29:12.380 --> 29:13.380
Ultima Online.

29:13.380 --> 29:14.380
Oh ok Ultima Online.

29:14.380 --> 29:16.380
We were really bored that day.

29:17.380 --> 29:19.380
There's also a lot of idiots on Ragnarok.

29:20.380 --> 29:26.380
Just randomly, I was in this one place that Ma and Chan showed me.

29:26.380 --> 29:28.380
This island that you have to get to from Alberta.

29:29.380 --> 29:30.380
Anyway, we were just sitting there.

29:30.380 --> 29:33.380
Like, in the cave leading in, just waiting.

29:33.380 --> 29:35.380
So I set up a chat room in there.

29:35.380 --> 29:37.380
Said, told if 200 is any.

29:37.380 --> 29:39.380
And people paid me.

29:39.380 --> 29:46.900
I got like 600. That's awesome. And other people, this is a great idea, they set up

29:46.900 --> 29:50.780
a kissing booth because there's an emoticon in the game that makes a smoochie and then

29:50.780 --> 29:56.540
a little heart comes up and they're making money. So I want to do though, one of my friends

29:56.540 --> 30:01.100
did, I forgot who this was. It was so long ago. One of the people I was playing with

30:01.100 --> 30:07.920
back on when I first was playing the second beta, um, decided, they wrote on this, um,

30:07.920 --> 30:14.300
like, sex or 500 zenny or something, or 5000, and so, the person went in there and paid

30:14.300 --> 30:17.180
up front, just like how you got fucked.

30:17.180 --> 30:26.180
That's great. Um, so, okay, we can bring this around to Bomani somehow, believe it or not,

30:26.180 --> 30:31.380
Because with the new DDR going to go online, that's going to be very interesting.

30:31.380 --> 30:43.980
I mean, do you think there's going to be more to it than just the, oh, find a person to

30:43.980 --> 30:48.740
dance with and watch them watch your other side of the screen get perfect scrapes boost?

30:48.740 --> 30:52.300
Or do you think there might be this whole like developing your own dancer type thing?

30:52.300 --> 30:56.940
I think it should be like dance magic and then with like conquest mode.

30:56.940 --> 30:58.860
If there was a god there would be dance magic mode.

30:58.860 --> 31:02.300
Wouldn't it be cool to have dance magic and then like be able to have your character just

31:02.300 --> 31:08.580
on the server randomly and you can have stats up there like in conquest mode from Soul Calibur.

31:08.580 --> 31:09.580
Wouldn't that be cool?

31:09.580 --> 31:10.580
Dance conquest!

31:10.580 --> 31:12.860
That would be cool!

31:12.860 --> 31:13.860
I'd play.

31:13.860 --> 31:17.300
This is why we should work for Konami.

31:17.300 --> 31:18.300
I'm sorry, Jamie?

31:18.300 --> 31:20.700
This is why we should work for Konami.

31:20.700 --> 31:21.700
I agree.

31:21.700 --> 31:49.700
1. More funny online gaming stories 2. This one time I was playing Counter Strike and the server had friendly fire on. I just entered the server and killed this guy for his gun. He got pissed and I left the server.

31:49.700 --> 31:51.700
Meanie

31:51.940 --> 31:53.940
Yeah, you can ask interested

31:55.660 --> 32:01.180
Did you do our angel has a story to share dad and I were playing Diablo 2 on our own server

32:01.420 --> 32:03.420
we came to upper cressat and

32:03.900 --> 32:06.200
Go after the council members one by one

32:06.200 --> 32:10.160
I start running around just to get the little monsters to get experience next thing

32:10.160 --> 32:16.140
You know somehow I end up having all seven council members chasing me. I scream help dad goes. How did you do that?

32:16.140 --> 32:21.540
I go I don't know dad proceeds to kill all their asses in less than five minutes while I lay there dead

32:24.860 --> 32:32.580
That's so interesting because um, I've never heard of anybody playing online games with their parents that would scare me to run into my mother

32:38.500 --> 32:41.660
Well, he's just cool like that and you know that any of us when we have kids

32:41.660 --> 32:43.280
We're gonna play games with our kids too

32:43.280 --> 32:48.260
but I just as it is now I could never imagine like my mother or my dad no my

32:48.260 --> 32:51.220
dad's actually computer savvy and there are some computer games he's played in

32:51.220 --> 32:55.700
the past mostly solitaire and shit like card games but if I were to run into him

32:55.700 --> 33:00.380
on an online game I'd like zap him so he couldn't like he couldn't embarrass me

33:00.380 --> 33:08.240
I'd kill him you know my party is named huh my party is named Battle Royale of

33:08.240 --> 33:09.360
Of course.

33:09.360 --> 33:11.600
I want to make a guild called Battle Royale.

33:11.600 --> 33:14.760
Or BR Act.

33:14.760 --> 33:18.120
The BR Act.

33:18.120 --> 33:22.560
I like, I really like that idea of DDR Online having a dancing conquest.

33:22.560 --> 33:26.040
That would be cool. What other cool DDR Online ideas

33:26.040 --> 33:27.560
have people thought of?

33:27.560 --> 33:28.440
How about this?

33:28.440 --> 33:30.720
How about they don't make it?

33:30.720 --> 33:34.800
Ooh, there's an idea.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.720
You're here.

33:36.720 --> 33:38.080
Shut up, bitch.

33:38.080 --> 33:41.500
That has nothing to do with the topic, Dan.

33:41.500 --> 33:47.580
I think they should make Stroker online, because that's how many people we're paying off.

33:47.580 --> 33:51.540
Nobody gets that, Loki. Nobody. I don't care.

33:51.540 --> 33:53.580
You know the game they need to make another one of?

33:53.580 --> 33:55.760
Freaking Night Trap.

33:55.760 --> 33:58.060
Night Trap 2. That would be the shit.

33:58.060 --> 34:02.520
Did you hear that, um, oh wait, Night Trap wasn't on 3DO. It was a Sega CD game, wasn't it?

34:02.520 --> 34:05.060
I owned the damn game.

34:05.060 --> 34:06.940
3DO filed for bankruptcy this week.

34:06.940 --> 34:07.440
Yay!

34:07.440 --> 34:13.940
And whenever I think of, you know, whenever I think of 3DO though, I think of that horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE Zelda game.

34:13.940 --> 34:16.940
That was a CD-i.

34:16.940 --> 34:17.940
Wasn't that 3DO?

34:17.940 --> 34:19.940
No, it was CD-i.

34:19.940 --> 34:20.940
Nevermind.

34:22.940 --> 34:26.940
3DO I'll always remember as the first time playing You Don't Know Jack.

34:26.940 --> 34:28.940
What the fuck did 3DO do then?

34:28.940 --> 34:31.940
They made the stupid army man games.

34:31.940 --> 34:34.940
Wasn't there a system called 3DO?

34:34.940 --> 34:37.540
There was a 3DO, but I don't think it was the same people.

34:37.540 --> 34:39.740
What the fuck was on the 3DO system?

34:39.740 --> 34:40.740
Flashback.

34:40.740 --> 34:41.740
That's it?

34:41.740 --> 34:43.740
That was their biggest game, was Flashback?

34:43.740 --> 34:47.820
They had this like, it was supposedly this, you know, what was it called, this something

34:47.820 --> 34:48.820
M technology?

34:48.820 --> 34:50.820
They had uh, Road Rage.

34:50.820 --> 34:52.340
Okay, here we go.

34:52.340 --> 34:55.260
Road Rage, Eternal Champions, thank you, Tarun.

34:55.260 --> 34:57.380
Eternal Champions was not on the freaking 3DO.

34:57.380 --> 34:58.380
Are you sure?

34:58.380 --> 35:02.180
I'm more than positive Kabuki Clash was on the 3DO.

35:02.180 --> 35:08.180
I just remembered those things for like 400 bucks. Fuck that.

35:08.180 --> 35:12.180
Eternal Champions was on the Genesis and the Eternal Champions CD was on the Sega CD.

35:12.180 --> 35:18.180
I own the game and I should know. I even bought, um, what was the thing called? The Menacer? Was that what it was called?

35:18.180 --> 35:19.180
Yeah.

35:19.180 --> 35:20.180
The Activator.

35:20.180 --> 35:22.180
Well, the Menacer was the gun.

35:22.180 --> 35:26.180
Right, I have got a Menacer. But I've got an Activator too, the one that's like the arena.

35:26.180 --> 35:29.180
I bought it at Virgin, like a year ago.

35:29.180 --> 35:32.180
Yeah, and it came with Eternal Champions.

35:34.180 --> 35:36.180
It's sitting in my closet.

35:36.180 --> 35:42.180
You know what? I kinda want a CD-i system and a 3DO just because, you know, nobody has them.

35:42.180 --> 35:44.180
You know what shitty system I want?

35:44.180 --> 35:45.180
What?

35:45.180 --> 35:46.180
A Jaguar CD.

35:46.180 --> 35:48.180
I want a Jaguar CD.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.180
So I can play Defender 2000.

35:49.180 --> 35:51.180
I want Tempest 2000.

35:51.180 --> 35:53.180
Okay, you can get it on Saturn then.

35:53.180 --> 35:55.180
Okay, but I want the Jaguar version.

35:55.180 --> 35:57.180
Same name name.

35:57.180 --> 36:01.180
But it's Atari's system, and it's Atari games, so...

36:01.180 --> 36:02.180
And it's easier to control on the...

36:02.180 --> 36:03.180
Shush!

36:05.180 --> 36:06.180
That's it.

36:06.180 --> 36:07.180
Saturn, right?

36:07.180 --> 36:09.180
Do I have a Saturn?

36:09.180 --> 36:10.180
Loki has a Saturn.

36:10.180 --> 36:11.180
Loki has a Saturn.

36:11.180 --> 36:12.180
I'll bring you over to Tempest 2000 next week.

36:12.180 --> 36:13.180
Oh dear lord.

36:13.180 --> 36:16.180
That's it, pre-show next week should be all Tempest 2000 songs.

36:16.180 --> 36:17.180
I'm down with that.

36:19.180 --> 36:21.180
Actually, I want to do...

36:21.180 --> 36:24.180
Jamie, you have to let me do one pre-show one week, because...

36:24.180 --> 36:25.180
No.

36:25.180 --> 36:26.180
I want to do...

36:26.180 --> 36:28.180
I want to do Commodore 64 music.

36:28.180 --> 36:30.180
Oh my god, yes!

36:30.180 --> 36:35.180
Did you hear what Bradley posted in response to your Commodore 64?

36:35.180 --> 36:40.180
Hold on, let me bring it up. Okay, for those of you that listen to Orange Laundry like all the time, that would be the cool people.

36:40.180 --> 36:47.180
On Friday night, you would have heard me doing a fuck off show because I was really bored and Irene flaked on me for going out Friday night.

36:47.180 --> 36:52.180
So I played a bunch of 80's music and that led into talk about Commodore 64.

36:52.180 --> 36:55.520
because the Commodore 64 was like the coolest computer system ever

36:55.520 --> 36:58.560
and it just turned twenty years old like two months ago but anyway

36:58.560 --> 37:00.040
so um...

37:00.040 --> 37:01.340
I had a point to this

37:01.340 --> 37:03.740
oh yeah I started downloading all these games and stuff

37:03.740 --> 37:05.080
and um... one of them

37:05.080 --> 37:09.520
one of the most memorable games for me on Commodore 64 was Impossible Mission

37:09.520 --> 37:11.980
tell us a little bit about Impossible Mission, Irene

37:11.980 --> 37:16.480
uh... it was really cheesy, it had really bad voice acting

37:16.480 --> 37:20.980
you basically had to try to put them together as well

37:20.980 --> 37:25.340
paper that had little, you know, googly marks and stuff. But anyway, it had really bad,

37:25.340 --> 37:30.820
like, pseudo-voice acting, and, um, Rob was gonna be pulling up, like, you know, a special

37:30.820 --> 37:34.420
treat or whatever, but yeah. It was really hard, like, you had to time it, and if you

37:34.420 --> 37:39.020
didn't beat it by then, then you, like, died for some reason. I don't really remember.

37:39.020 --> 37:45.660
Yeah, but it was a great game. Hey, Rob. You know what I wanna bring over? What? My Coleco

37:45.660 --> 37:50.740
vision. What do you have on Coleco vision? Oh, you have the Casey Munchkin on. That was

37:50.740 --> 37:55.900
the Odyssey. My bad. You don't even have a TV that my Odyssey will work with. You need

37:55.900 --> 38:02.780
one of those old ones with like the prong hookup thingies. Ok hold on I'm going to download

38:02.780 --> 38:06.780
that sound clip we were talking about earlier. Oh my god. If I can get it. But we need to

38:06.780 --> 38:15.220
play Smurf. Or I can bring over the 2600 and we can play the worst game ever. What? E.T.

38:15.220 --> 38:20.640
I saw. Or Pac-Man. I saw this hilarious commercial on G4 today. There was this guy and I guess

38:20.640 --> 38:24.560
he was a programmer or whatever and he says hey I'm so-and-so and I programmed

38:24.560 --> 38:29.840
Yars revenge and I programmed um he's I programmed Yars revenge and I programmed

38:29.840 --> 38:33.120
what was the other thing he'd done and then he goes he said I programmed Yars

38:33.120 --> 38:39.120
revenge I programmed Raiders of the Lost Ark and I programmed ET. He's like so I'm

38:39.120 --> 38:44.320
known for one of the best 2600 games of all time and one of the worst. Anyway oh

38:44.320 --> 38:48.240
here's that sound file we were talking about earlier kids.

39:18.240 --> 39:29.240
I've actually got promo for the prototype. They did, and they put these out I think at one of the classic gaming conventions which I want to go to in Vegas.

39:29.240 --> 39:34.240
But they, I think it's Classic Gaming Expo is the one that's in Vegas over here.

39:34.240 --> 39:36.240
Oh, I hella want to go to that. When is that?

39:36.240 --> 39:39.240
I think it's in August is when it's coming up.

39:39.240 --> 39:41.240
I hope it's not the same weekend as Cyberbeat Nation 2.

39:41.240 --> 39:43.240
I don't know.

39:43.240 --> 39:49.400
But, um, well, anyway, they have prototype games. They've actually

39:49.400 --> 39:54.200
cartridge-ized and everything. And this guy sold them on eBay. And we picked up

39:55.960 --> 39:59.240
Super Pac-Man, which is my favorite Pac-Man game.

39:59.240 --> 40:01.320
Yes, I agree. Super Pac-Man is the best Pac-Man game.

40:01.320 --> 40:05.720
And we picked up Millipede for this. And I've got a trackball.

40:05.720 --> 40:06.200
Ah, cool.

40:07.320 --> 40:10.280
Nothing beats playing Millipede on a 5200 with a trackball.

40:10.280 --> 40:15.280
There are very few experiences that are as beautiful as that.

40:15.280 --> 40:19.280
I have a quick Bamani related question when it comes to Atari 2600.

40:19.280 --> 40:23.280
Wasn't somebody trying to develop Dance Dance Revolution for the 2600?

40:23.280 --> 40:24.280
Yes.

40:24.280 --> 40:25.280
Whatever happened with that?

40:25.280 --> 40:27.280
Loki, you probably follow that subject better than any of us.

40:27.280 --> 40:32.280
No, it's because people still program for the 2600 for I don't know whatever reason,

40:32.280 --> 40:33.280
because it's fun.

40:33.280 --> 40:37.280
They were trying to create like a sort of Dance Dance Revolution type game, and the

40:37.280 --> 40:47.280
The problem is they had to do it like horizontally instead of vertically because I guess the vertical refresh rate isn't as fast as the horizontal refresh rate or something like that.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.280
It's like playing Beatmania on the WonderSwan.

40:53.280 --> 40:54.280
Yeah, you were saying?

40:54.280 --> 40:58.280
Anyway, so yeah, I don't think that it would ever win anywhere.

40:58.280 --> 41:08.280
You know what I want to get? They have for your cell phones, or for certain cell phones, you know how you can put games on there? Yeah, pump it up.

41:08.280 --> 41:13.280
Yeah, I heard about that, but I couldn't find where you'd download it.

41:13.280 --> 41:15.280
I think it's only for Korean cell phones.

41:15.280 --> 41:18.280
There's pictures in one of the DDR live journal things.

41:18.280 --> 41:21.280
I'm too lazy to go look them up.

41:21.280 --> 41:23.280
Just because they're garlicky.

41:23.280 --> 41:27.280
I think we need to take a break. Let's take a quick break. We're going to do a break, and this is...

41:27.280 --> 41:31.340
memory of cheese attached to them. We're gonna play some 9th Style songs this break. So the

41:31.340 --> 41:38.340
quality of the MP3s is kinda eh, but you guys might enjoy these anyways. So it's a free

41:39.160 --> 41:44.980
preview here of what's coming up on 9th Style. We're gonna play the following songs. Emotion

41:44.980 --> 41:51.260
2003, Romantic Extra, Abyss, Let's Say Hello, and Distress. So we're gonna hear all those

41:51.260 --> 41:54.320
fabulous night style songs and then we'll be back

41:54.320 --> 41:55.860
sound like a plan

41:55.860 --> 41:59.980
you are listening to orange lounge radio

41:59.980 --> 42:02.900
if you want to join in the fun in the chat room when they're all reminiscing about

42:02.900 --> 42:06.300
classic video games right now i'm seeing all these great games being named right now

42:06.300 --> 42:07.460
adventure

42:07.460 --> 42:08.740
beachhead

42:08.740 --> 42:10.780
mule

42:10.780 --> 42:14.440
mule uh... or I should say M-U-L-E

42:14.440 --> 42:18.260
combat

42:18.260 --> 42:20.940
So we will be right back after some night style mp3s

42:20.940 --> 42:25.360
So the quality of these is kind of am but it'll give you an impression of what you can look forward to very soon

42:25.360 --> 42:27.360
We'll be back.

43:55.360 --> 43:59.360
The

43:59.360 --> 44:03.360
The

44:03.360 --> 44:07.360
The

44:07.360 --> 44:11.360
The

44:11.360 --> 44:15.360
The

44:15.360 --> 44:19.360
The

44:19.360 --> 44:23.360
The

49:53.360 --> 50:16.080
It's more contagious than SARS It's Orange Lounge Radio

50:16.080 --> 50:17.080
Howdy!

50:17.080 --> 50:18.080
We're back!

50:18.080 --> 50:19.080
How are you?

50:19.080 --> 50:20.080
SARS horrific!

50:20.080 --> 50:22.760
I hope you enjoyed those 9 style preview songs.

50:22.760 --> 50:26.760
I know the quality was a little poopy, but you know, they always are at first.

50:26.760 --> 50:29.760
I'm surprised we haven't had better ones by this point yet, though.

50:29.760 --> 50:32.760
I'm so happy about the second to last song.

50:32.760 --> 50:33.760
The Let's Say Hello?

50:33.760 --> 50:34.760
Uh-huh.

50:34.760 --> 50:35.760
That song's cute.

50:35.760 --> 50:36.760
That one was cool.

50:36.760 --> 50:37.760
It sounds worthy of, like, pop and music-ness.

50:37.760 --> 50:40.760
It makes me think of Murmur Twins.

50:40.760 --> 50:41.760
You think it's the same group?

50:41.760 --> 50:42.760
I don't think it is.

50:42.760 --> 50:45.760
No, it just makes me think of Murmur Twins.

50:45.760 --> 50:46.760
Hmm.

50:46.760 --> 50:49.760
I don't know who did that, and I'm too lazy to look it up right now.

50:49.760 --> 50:53.760
So, we're back. Hello, how are you?

50:53.760 --> 50:57.760
I'm trying to think.

50:57.760 --> 51:01.760
I'm hazelnutty. And garlicky.

51:01.760 --> 51:05.760
I noticed Loki's working on some things over there. You want to do the cage match?

51:05.760 --> 51:09.760
Sure. Did I bring a song? You did bring a song.

51:09.760 --> 51:13.760
Okay, I forgot if I did. Yes you did. Okay, we're going to do the cage match.

51:13.760 --> 51:17.760
Because we usually don't do the cage match early in the show, we're just going to throw people through the loop.

51:17.760 --> 51:23.440
you can win that's has he has he been four weeks yes oh yes this will be the

51:23.440 --> 51:27.680
fourth week cuz Mona Lisa Overdrive had two weeks the first time because of b3

51:27.680 --> 51:34.360
yes oh we've got more people here hello it's men hello boys and girls it's man

51:34.360 --> 51:41.640
oh sorry I dropped your shits kids it's men we are the men's in this house hey

51:41.640 --> 51:45.540
the topic we were talking about before you guys got here I know Matt maybe has

51:45.540 --> 51:49.180
something to contribute because he used to play ever crack we were just talking

51:49.180 --> 51:53.700
about funny no funny online gaming stories and I already told the one about

51:53.700 --> 52:01.420
you telling people in Ragnarok yet stars yes Oh video which Jamie just asked me

52:01.420 --> 52:05.340
if I'm paying to play they just okay we just felt like a half hour talking about

52:05.340 --> 52:08.740
Ragnarok so make it quick quick all right for those if there's anybody who's

52:08.740 --> 52:12.380
interested or is playing they did today shut off the servers to get ready for

52:12.380 --> 52:19.380
It did just come back up, and instead of being 12,000 people on the server with lots of lag, there's 2,400 people on the server with no lag.

52:19.380 --> 52:24.380
We had an update from Aaron who says 3,800 people are logged into Chaos right now.

52:24.380 --> 52:26.380
Loki is a little less people.

52:26.380 --> 52:29.380
Damn, there's less people on you, Loki.

52:29.380 --> 52:32.380
I have lots of people on me.

52:32.380 --> 52:34.380
Yeah, it's just weird.

52:34.380 --> 52:41.380
Do you have any quick, fun, stupid online gaming stories you want to share? Like things that happen to you in an online game?

52:41.380 --> 52:47.380
Yeah, okay, here's another. Do you mind if I talk about Ragnarok? Sure. If it's funny, it has to be funny.

52:47.380 --> 52:48.380
It is pretty funny.

52:48.380 --> 52:50.380
Wait, is it about the guy in the armor? Because I told that one too.

52:50.380 --> 52:51.380
The guy in the armor?

52:51.380 --> 52:56.380
Never mind. The guy who was going to give away the armor said just kidding and ran off.

52:56.380 --> 52:59.380
Oh, no. That was funny though.

52:59.380 --> 53:04.380
One of the classes has the ability to warp people places.

53:04.380 --> 53:11.380
Well, when people got wins that they were going to be going pay to play, like 50 or more percent of the people who play the beta didn't like that.

53:11.380 --> 53:15.380
So they started warping people to places where they can't get out of it.

53:15.380 --> 53:18.380
And they did that to me, the Christmas village.

53:18.380 --> 53:21.380
I had a fly wing too, but it took me 10 minutes to realize I had one.

53:21.380 --> 53:27.380
And so they were sitting there and I took screen captures and I was like, I'm going to report you guys to gravity and you're going to get kicked off the server.

53:27.380 --> 53:33.620
15 minutes ago called your topic arrived. I'm just kidding. You know what? I just got here. I'm just kidding

53:34.260 --> 53:36.260
I am go good not this

53:37.300 --> 53:39.540
Matt do you have any ever cracked stories that are funny?

53:40.500 --> 53:44.900
No one more little thing. Okay. I freaking got warped to five different locations in a row

53:45.540 --> 53:47.540
And then sent me to glass time

53:47.700 --> 53:49.700
I hate glass time

53:52.020 --> 53:54.020
Eat electric death

53:54.020 --> 53:57.020
Yes, greatest video game quote ever.

54:24.020 --> 54:29.340
lounge radio so let's start it off with the reigning champion Loki's pick three

54:29.340 --> 54:34.300
weeks actually only two shows victorious but since we had no show the weekend of

54:34.300 --> 54:39.140
b3 it's been victorious for three weeks now so this is the last time it can win

54:39.140 --> 54:46.500
and this will be the very first four week rotated song if this one so here's

54:46.500 --> 54:50.300
Here's a clip of Loki's song.

54:50.300 --> 54:51.300
You want to introduce us?

54:51.300 --> 54:58.740
This is Don Davis and Juno Reactor with Mona Lisa Overdrive from the Matrix Reloaded movie.

54:58.740 --> 55:04.100
And since it is last week's winner, you only get to hear a clip, sorry kids.

55:04.100 --> 55:11.100
So here's a clip of Mona Lisa overdrive.

56:34.100 --> 56:44.060
Then there's a clip of last week's winner, Mona Lisa Overdrive.

56:44.060 --> 56:45.060
Beautiful.

56:45.060 --> 56:47.860
Alright, the next entry tonight comes from...

56:47.860 --> 56:48.860
Jamie!

56:48.860 --> 56:50.500
That's going to annoy the hell out of Matt.

56:50.500 --> 56:51.500
Okay, so tell us...

56:51.500 --> 56:52.500
It's something Speedmix.

56:52.500 --> 56:53.500
Uh oh.

56:53.500 --> 56:54.500
Oh God, it's a Speedmix.

56:54.500 --> 56:55.500
Well, tell us about it.

56:55.500 --> 56:56.500
It's September.

56:56.500 --> 56:57.500
It's old school stuff.

56:57.500 --> 56:58.500
It's old school.

56:58.500 --> 56:59.500
Who's it by?

56:59.500 --> 57:00.500
I don't remember.

57:00.500 --> 57:03.500
DJ Speedo with September the Speedo mix.

57:03.500 --> 57:09.140
I think I got this one from JB, but I like the song anyway because I like the original.

57:09.140 --> 57:10.140
Alright, sounds good.

57:10.140 --> 57:13.560
So this is Jamie's pick for this week, and since it's a new entry, you get to hear the

57:13.560 --> 57:15.320
whole five minute long version.

57:15.320 --> 57:16.320
Here it is.

57:16.320 --> 57:20.540
DJ Speedo with September, the Speedo mix, Jamie's pick for the cage match this week.

57:20.540 --> 57:22.540
Enjoy

58:20.540 --> 58:23.540
You're the king of the world, we're singing

58:23.540 --> 58:26.540
There's a dance of the night in the mud

58:26.540 --> 58:29.540
How the stars roll the night away

58:59.540 --> 59:03.540
Are you flying? Are you flying away?

59:03.540 --> 59:25.540
My thoughts are with you, holding hands with your arms I see you, over the wall below Remember how when you look at me, I'll be there with you

59:25.540 --> 59:35.540
My thoughts are with you, holding hands with your arms I see you, always look on in love Remember, how a new love was here this day

59:36.540 --> 59:46.540
Now December is on the line, we'll share in September Only blue for time alone, remember True love is shared today

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:26.540
Now I'm with you, holding hands with your arms I see you, a little bit hard to love Remember how a new love was here today

01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:37.540
Now the summer, summer love, yeah, the summer Only a little time to love, remember True love is here today

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:53.380
I was about to leave the house, and I couldn't find a song, so I picked September, because

01:02:53.380 --> 01:03:00.160
I like the song, I like the original, I like the speed mix okay, I give it an upper level

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.660
eight, barely a nine.

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:03.620
Upper level eight, barely a nine from Jamie.

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:09.120
Okay, I give it a 2 because it's a speedmix and I hate speedmixes and everything.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.620
What did I say?

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.620
I hate speedmixes.

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:15.620
God dammit, it's not a new song, you just sped up the old one.

01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:18.620
Stop it.

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:24.620
I would give that song like, I don't know, okay, this is my problem with speedmixes.

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:27.620
DDR size, like a minute and a half, two minutes, they're awesome.

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:30.620
They're cool, they're fun, they're cheesy to dance to, they're great.

01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:33.620
Five minutes long? Joke's old.

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:36.620
So, if that were two minutes long, I'd give it like an eight.

01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:39.620
But since it's five minutes long, I'm gonna have it and give it a four.

01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:44.620
But I do, I like the original too.

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.620
Yeah, the original was good.

01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:50.620
I love the original. I love the original, but... no.

01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:52.620
It's just a... no.

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:56.620
Alright. Matt, the ice prince, or ice queen, whatever we're calling you.

01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:57.620
Whatever.

01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:59.620
We have the rice princess and the ice princess.

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:04.620
I like that better than Ice Queen. I'm not that dramatic, bitch.

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:09.620
Anyway, I have to give that about a six. Rob made a good point.

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:14.620
Five minutes is a little too long for a speed mix. It just gets repetitive, so...

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:19.620
Well, it depends on how you're... Well, never mind. Anyway, I give it a six.

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:27.620
The problem is it goes so fast that really you're listening to about 15 minutes worth of music in that little five minute spot.

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:32.620
Loki makes a damn good point. Listen up everybody. Irene, you have something to say?

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:40.620
Yeah, I agree. I give it a 6 too, because I'm really burnt out on speed mixes, especially all the crap that you play on Orange Lounge.

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:45.620
Yeah, that you need to take off. But yeah, 6, yeah, whatever.

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:56.620
Mr. Brad, there are only three good speed songs in this world. Can't Stop Falling in Love, If You Were Here With Me Before the Beat, and the Aerosmith Jaded song.

01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:59.620
If it's not that, it's not good. If it's two.

01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:01.620
No, it's a one.

01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:05.620
What?

01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:09.620
Yeah, there was a speed mix that won the cage match one time.

01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:11.620
Yeah, I was heaven is a place on earth.

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:17.620
So, I think the general public would tend to disagree with you, Mr. Brad.

01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:21.620
The general public doesn't matter.

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:25.620
Because they're all retards and they don't play Ragnarok online.

01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:27.620
Jamie knows what I'm talking about

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.680
Anyway, can we get onto my pic now?

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:30.680
No, they don't need to play rock n' roll

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.680
My pick, my pick, my pick time

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.680
There's never gonna be any more clocks

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.680
My pick time, it's my pick time

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:38.680
Fine, go! God

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.680
Okay, who remembers like about three months ago

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.680
when I put in a song by Kylie Minogue called

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.680
Your Disco Needs You

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:46.680
And everybody wanted to kill me

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.680
Well, this is a Kylie song that people said

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.680
I should have put in instead

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.680
And this is, I'll admit it

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:56.780
much better Kylie song and if any Kylie song would win the cage match should be

01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:00.660
this one and it's very cute it's very depth will to be great of a Monty game

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:05.260
and it's got a great video it's got a wonderful video to it it but you can't

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:09.100
see it because it's radio hot this is Kylie Minogue with come into my world

01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:14.900

01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:16.900
Enjoy

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:52.900
Take these offers made for lovin' And this heart that's so big for two

01:06:52.900 --> 01:07:00.900
Take these eyes that will make for what's in over you

And I've been such a long time waitin' For someone I could call my own

Won't you move me up, up high up on your hands, up high up on your hands

Take these lips off of me for a kiss And this heart I will see you through

And these hands of the made-to-touch shall feel you

For free your love

01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:58.280
I am on your love, baby

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:04.280
Come, come, come into my world

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:07.280
But you're giving me up

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:14.280
Higher from your, higher from your love

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:54.320
Alright, boys and girls, Kylie Minogue with Come Into My World, what did y'all think of

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:55.320
that one?

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:58.360
Jamie's in the facilities right now, so we'll start with Irene.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:04.640
Oh, I like Kylie, um, that was a pretty good one, I give it an 8, I'd rather hear In Your

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.760
Eyes, but that one's pretty good.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.760
Maybe another time, in another three months I'll do it, you're right.

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:09.760
Yeah.

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:10.760
Yeah.

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:11.760
Alright.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:12.760
What do you give it honest?

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.760
One to ten?

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:14.760
Eight?

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:15.760
You give it an eight?

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:16.760
An eight, yeah.

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:17.760
Alright.

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:18.760
Uh.

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:19.760
Whoever grabs the mic next?

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:20.760
Eight.

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:21.760
Jamie.

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:22.760
Eight.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:23.760
Brad.

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:26.760
Um.

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:30.760
I give it an eight too, because I like this one a lot, but.

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:32.760
Not a huge Kylie fan.

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:33.760
I know.

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:34.760
Fine.

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:40.180
Kill me kick me out of here be gone. Just beat me up now, please ice ween

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:46.600
What I sweat well, no that was only last night oh

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.480
Boy anyway

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.520
Anyway, if that was anything like the other song that you were playing

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:57.600
I was gonna have to tell somebody to go get a rope so we can hang you by your friggin toes from the ceiling

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:00.840
But no, that was a good one. I like that song a lot. I give that a nine

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:02.840
Okay, excellent.

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.840
Loki!

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:09.840
Wow, you know, that sounded like every other fucking song that she sings.

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:19.840
Gee, um, hmm, since I've heard it before, you know, I'm gonna have to say that, uh, I'm gonna give it a zero because it sucks ass.

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:26.840
And, no, actually, no, Kylie's alright, but that song sucks. Seriously, she has done much better stuff in that song.

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:35.840
I actually have to decrease mine because last weekend when Marron and I had lunch in San Francisco, they played nothing but Kylie Minogue.

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:40.840
And then I was there the weekend before, so all of you were at the tourney and I went to go get lunch.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:46.840
And it was when Megumi-chan and I were having lunch and they were playing Kylie. So I dropped mine to a six.

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:57.840
Just out of bitterness. I would just like to, I would like to retort Loki's argument and say that that song sounds nothing like I should be so lucky in love.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:04.840
I should be so lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.840
Come on!

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:10.840
Anyway, I give it a ten, it's fabulous.

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:16.840
Alright, here we go. You can send your votes now. Here's a quick recap of the songs in tonight's Cade Match.

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:22.840
Pick number one, last week's winner, three weeks winner, Mona Lisa Overdrive and The Matrix 2.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.840
That's a shitty clip of the song. Let me play a different clip.

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:49.360
All right, pick number two, DJ Speedo with Sick Timber.

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:59.040
And pick number three, Kylie Minogue, Come Into My World.

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:00.040

01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:56.540
All right. Ooh, my screen is filling up with votes for the cage match. I'm going to have to go count those in a little bit.

01:14:56.540 --> 01:15:00.600
In the meantime, what else do you kids want to talk about today?

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:02.300
Do we have a sim update with Loki?

01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:03.660
Loki's been awfully quiet.

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:04.600
I think Kylie scared him.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.400
So, let's wake him up with a sim update.

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:10.740
You know, I want to know where my freaking Dancy Stage Party Edition stuff went.

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:12.200
It's like disappeared off my computer.

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:12.800
That's weird.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:18.920
Anyways, there's a new CVS update for StepMania.

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:21.440
It was just updated yesterday, I believe.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:22.820
Pretty nice.

01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:24.020
I was playing with that earlier.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:29.620
They've got a bunch of new modifiers added in there, which is pretty cool, and then they've also done some other things.

01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:32.620
They added a few things where you can adjust the pitch of the song.

01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:40.020
Before it used to be limited just to 0.7, now you can go all the way down to 0.3, which makes the song sound really bad.

01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:46.020
But, you know, if you really wanted to practice or something, that's pretty good for you, and it loads really nice, so go check that one out.

01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:52.020
And if you haven't checked out, there's a new DWI version, 2.49 or whatever, but I don't play DWI because it's inferior,

01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:55.100
So, you know, go check that one out too.

01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:58.760
Now, as for other updates, let's see here.

01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:03.740
Check for my sims because that Uber or Utterdude or whatever,

01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:07.660
that guy is releasing a lot of cool stuff and pretty much all the step files kick ass

01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:09.660
and they're just really playable, so go play those.

01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:16.480
And other than that, I have the second most DWIs on the internet other than Shoei,

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:20.320
which has, you know, 5,000 by 3,000 something now, so yay.

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:30.320
I would have 5000 if I put every single one that he has in there because I have all those files but unfortunately he has duplicates so I don't put them all in there.

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:33.320
Anyways, so back to you.

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:35.320
Wonderful.

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:38.320
Wasn't there a new StepMania on stuff?

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:40.320
Weren't you even listening to what I was-

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:44.320
No I wasn't. Um, they weren't either. They were over there in the corner talking about their-

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.320
I was tallying cage match votes, I'm sorry.

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:49.320
Hello, Joe.

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:51.320
We're talking about money, go away.

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:53.320
What about money?

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:55.320
We're talking about the fact that you don't have it.

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:57.320
Yeah.

01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:59.320
Sniff.

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:01.320
Hello, we're trying to do a show here, what's up?

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.320
If you're gonna stand on the show, what's up?

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:05.320
What?

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:07.320
Shut up.

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.320
Bitch, please.

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:11.320
Your hair is sticking up.

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:13.320
Okay, Irene, what would you like for McDonald's?

01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:17.320
I'd like a chicken sandwich and some fries.

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:20.820
Okay, so maybe I'll just get the meal. It's the fries and the drink and stuff.

01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:21.960
I'll take your car, right?

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:24.040
Whatever's cheaper. Yeah, you can take my car.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:27.040
Okay, I gotta go get cash back. Can you get me one of those cheesecake McFlurries while you're out?

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:32.320
Hey, fuck you! See, this is why I need things on the radio, because I need food for McDonald's, too.

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:38.960
Our listeners really want to hear about the Uber ride. I think they do. No.

01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:42.880
Listeners, you care about what we're getting at McDonald's. I say we have a vote.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.600
What do you think we should get at McDonald's?

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:46.200
No, don't get them mixed up with the Cajun Metro.

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:51.440
I want one if they have the, for a limited time only, they have the Strawberry

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.360
Cheesecake McFlurries.

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:53.800
For a limited time.

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:55.040
For a limited time only.

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:58.960
That's okay, cause I'm just going to go eat sandwich at my house after the show.

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:01.360
You're going to go eat a sandwich?

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:01.680
Fine.

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:02.120
I don't eat.

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:04.760
Okay.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.920
Um, so you're going to give me that McFlurry if I give you money?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.320
The strawberry cheesecake one?

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:16.320
If they don't have the strawberry cheesecake one, you can get me an Oreo one.

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:17.320
Teehee.

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.320
Boom shakalaka.

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.320
Thank you, Bradley.

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:20.320
You're my friend.

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:21.320
Yes, thank you.

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:22.320
Okay, hi.

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.320
See?

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:24.320
We already got a vote.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:36.320
We got a vote for double quarter pounder with cheese meal.

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.320
That's a royal with cheese.

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:38.320
Is everybody leaving?

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.320
Hi.

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:40.320
Oh.

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:45.320
What are you getting frustrated about?

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:50.320
I'm missing step files and my programs just disappeared out of my taskbar.

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:55.320
Dammit!

01:18:55.320 --> 01:19:00.320
Irene, are you guys going to do Orange Crush tonight?

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:05.320
Okay, that's something to look forward to in the next hour or so.

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:07.320
You want to do a list list tonight?

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:08.320
We haven't done one in forever.

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:09.320
We haven't done one in forever.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:13.320
Let's do a list list when we get back, since there will only be four of us here, right?

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:15.320
I'm taking a nap.

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:17.320
What list list topic?

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:18.320
I'll think of one.

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.320
I will solicit ideas from the chat room.

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.320
We have no idea what to do on list list tonight.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:25.320
Top of cool anime in the world.

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:27.320
I'd have to research that.

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.320
Top of cool anime.

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.320
Haven't we done best anime before?

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.320
No, we never have.

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:35.320
How about Worst Bemani Game?

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:38.320
There's probably not enough.

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:41.320
We could do Worst Video Game.

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:43.320
Did we do Worst Video Game?

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.320
Yes.

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:48.320
Let's see.

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:52.320
No, but I'm not getting suggestions for a listless segment.

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:55.320
Well anticipated video game from E3, like it didn't.

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.320
No.

01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:04.120
G4 can kiss my balls, because I was watching this show on there, but Rob, you might get

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.120
SARS.

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.120
I know, I might.

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:07.120
I was watching this show on there today.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:10.600
What was that, the 10 play or something like that?

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:11.600
Which one?

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:12.600
The 10 play.

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:13.600
What was that show?

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:14.600
The 10 spot?

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:15.600
10 play?

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:16.600
Yeah, 10 play.

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:21.520
I think that's what it was called or something like that, where it's a top 10 show.

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:27.280
And they were doing top 10 most like changing video games of all time, like video games

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:30.800
that changed the scene of all time, arcade games that changed the scene of all time.

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:31.800
What?

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:34.320
Why is Pikachu humping Friendship Bear's arm?

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:35.320
I don't know.

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:40.560
Anyway, so they were doing like the top 10 games that changed arcades, and number one

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:42.320
of course was Pac-Man.

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:47.160
Number 10, this was cool, was Final Furlong.

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:49.440
But number 8 was Dance Dance Revolution.

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:50.440
Oh yay.

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:56.440
Fucking G4TV, when they were talking about Dance Dance Revolution, guess what they showed a picture of?

01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:57.440
What?

01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:59.440
3D, uh, uh, Easy to Dancer.

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:00.440
Easy to Dancer.

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.440
What stupid fucks they are.

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:05.440
They're stupid British.

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:16.440
Um, but actually they, they had actually rounded up, um, they called, no, they said number whatever it was was Dance Dance Revolution, but they were actually talking about all the Bomani games, which is even worse.

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:18.440
Anyway.

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:19.440
This one's loud.

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:23.440
Okay, here's some suggestions from the chat room for tonight's list list.

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:25.440
Best Taka song?

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:26.440

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:39.440
Worst Pokemon?

01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:41.440
No, that's retarded.

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:44.440
Top of cool game shows hosted by Dick Clark?

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:45.440
Yes.

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:48.440
There's only two in like three that I can think of.

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.960
We need to do top game shows.

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:52.060
Alright, fine. Top game shows.

01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:57.740
Okay, agreed. We've never done that, have we? No. Okay, fine. Top game shows it is.

01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:03.100
Best freaking game show is the topic for tonight, so we will get to that after this quick break.

01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:05.100
Featuring songs from...

01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:10.980
Well, let's see, we've done... Eurobeat! Eurobeat! There's no one here to vote on anything.

01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:13.320
They'll be here. The chat room votes. Eurobeat.

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:17.320
Yeah, they're gonna be, that's true, maybe we need to post Homeless List for a little bit.

01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:18.320
Play Drivin'.

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:19.320
What?

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:20.320
Play Drivin'.

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:21.320
Eurobeat?

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:22.320
What's Drivin' from?

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.320
Play Drivin'.

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:24.320

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:25.320
No.

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:26.320
Drivin'.

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:27.320
From 8 style, right?

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:28.320
Yes.

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:29.320
It's not Drivin', it's Drivin'.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:30.320
As in Drivin' in the car.

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.320
It's a Naoki song.

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:36.320
Alright, so we've done 7 style songs, 9 style songs, I guess we'll do 8 style songs now.

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:39.240
So, we're going to do drive it if I have it.

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.240
I don't know if I have it.

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:45.180
I do. I swear I do somewhere.

01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:46.300
Oh, I got it.

01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:46.660
I got it.

01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:47.700
I got it.

01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:48.200
Nah, nah, nah.

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:51.180
Okay. So, we're going to take a quick break with some eight-style songs.

01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:52.640
When we come back, we'll have Orange Crush.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.760
We'll do Listless at some point when the others get back

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:57.380
and our general clusterfuck of random topics.

01:22:57.380 --> 01:23:04.320
If you want to join our chat room, head on over to www.kaliipimani.com.

He'll know what I'm talking about, with 100k.

01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:57.180
again

01:23:57.180 --> 01:24:00.180
baby you're so real, baby for sure

01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:03.180
i know we can't go home

01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:06.180
we're driving in your car

01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:09.180
we have never gone this far

01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:12.180
now's the time to come for us

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:16.180
spend the night together now

01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:20.180
driving in your car

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:24.180
you can get into my heart

01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:29.180
Let's say no, and we'll play tonight together

01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:31.180
We'll play tonight together

01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:33.180
It's rising in your heart

01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:36.180
Who knew we would come this far?

01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:39.180
I can't wait for us to spend

01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:43.180
The whole night together now

01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:45.180
It's rising in your soul

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:48.180
And they can't give up so far

01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:51.180
I love you and you, I can't

01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:56.180
I'll always be forever more

01:28:51.180 --> 01:29:10.180
I know this is it, but I can't admit It's all in my past

01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:16.180
So I can't ignore the fact No more your memory will last

01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:22.180
Deep within my mind I will always find emotions still remain

01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:29.180
Hold my heart still yet, set the fire still, but I can't put out the pain

01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:35.180
I would never have assumed you'd need me without mental wounds

01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:41.180
You know the reason why I can't forgive everybody

01:29:41.180 --> 01:29:48.180
You have left me not for life, just for what you've got, like a knife

01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:54.180
I can forgive and forget

01:29:58.180 --> 01:30:02.180
Forgive and forget

01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:06.180
You've only got yourself a hand

01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:51.660
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:52.660
Go!

01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:58.100
Let's go right, go figure, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:30:58.100 --> 01:30:59.100
Woohoo!

01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:00.100
Woohoo!

01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:01.100
Hello, boys and girls.

01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:02.100
Hi, Lucy!

01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:35.220
Target and we're right on the other side of the prison, so if there's ever a prison break-

01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:38.980
Next week, Storm's Lands will be hosted from my house.

01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:42.100
And all future weeks.

01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:43.100
It's fine.

01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:48.180
Oh, they're saying in the chat room that the ferret, or now it's the coyote or whatever

01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:49.180
that thing is-

01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:52.500
Yeah, I like talking to the coyote.

01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:56.580
It sounds like one of the animals from Happy Tree Friends.

01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:59.180
And then they say it sounds like Menchie.

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:01.140
Menchie flavor, mmm.

01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:08.140
So, wow, it's just the three of us here now, the three hosts, it's weird.

01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:11.140
You should have been here this week.

01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:13.140
Maren should have been here this week.

01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:18.140
Less crowded, less chances to get claustrophobia.

01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:20.140
Or catch SARS.

01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:25.140
Or catch SARS, yeah, because I still have it. Remember brain tumor, SARS, all at the same time?

01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:27.140
Yeah, it's awful.

01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:31.660
So is there, do we want to talk shit about any of the other people that are on this show

01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:32.660
usually?

01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:33.660
Well, you know what?

01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:34.660
That, that Brad.

01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:35.660
Oh, that Brad.

01:32:35.660 --> 01:32:39.660
Congesting the server all by himself that I don't even play on.

01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:40.660
Man, he's so skinny.

01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:41.660
Yeah, what's up with that?

01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:44.740
And that Ice Queen, what a fag.

01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:45.740
And Rice Princess?

01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:48.500
I haven't seen her eat rice in a year.

01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:50.540
How dare she call herself that?

01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:55.860
That reminds me, I have to use the rice cooker.

01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:56.860
You know what?

01:32:56.860 --> 01:32:58.860
I dare the shit and it's time to flush.

01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:03.860
What was that laugh?

01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:05.860
I hate being sick.

01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:07.860
This is giving us SARS again.

01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:09.860
Every time I laugh I cough.

01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:17.860
I'm going to beat that thing senseless.

01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:19.860
Give it to me.

01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:27.980
I know, I thought of a fun thing we could do, since we were kind of making fun of G4

01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:31.980
before the break, I thought maybe we could take a look at the list, and this can be like

01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:34.580
an ongoing thing, because there's a lot to talk about here.

01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:38.860
We could talk about G4's list that they got together with the Entertainment Weekly.

01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:43.100
I'll just shut up and let that thing talk.

01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:44.100
Okay.

01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:45.100
Okay.

01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:46.100
Huh.

01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:48.580
I had to do the elementary school trick to make it work.

01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:50.580
Don't do it!

01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:52.580
Yeah, I gotta take that thing away.

01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:54.580
You see this? It's mine now.

01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:56.580
This is mine now.

01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:58.580
Alright.

01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:00.580
It's an ass for the bad touch.

01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:04.580
They have an ass shot for the bad touch, that's sweet.

01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:06.580
Is that the official background?

01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:08.580
Yes it is.

01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:12.580
Do they have the background for it can't get you out of my head?

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:14.580
I'm just curious what it looks like.

01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:31.460
We are going to talk about G4's list of the 100 greatest games of all time that they got

01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:34.540
together with Entertainment Wheelie and we are going to make fun of it.

01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:37.700
Oh, you are going to go blow your nose.

01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:42.540
First off, if you happen to be watching G4 any time of the day, no matter what day, you

01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:45.560
you're gonna catch this god damn show because they play it

01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:47.120
all the time

01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:51.640
all the time

01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:55.680
so now we're gonna talk about the one hundred greatest video games of all time

01:34:55.680 --> 01:35:00.300
according to a bunch of schmoes

01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:03.080
DDR is on the list I might add

01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:06.120
DDR is on the list so if you don't know where it clocks in

01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:09.960
uh... listen to us we'll tell you where it clocks in

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:10.940
here we go

01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:12.940
And you're sitting on it, don't you feel special?

01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:15.940
Okay, so let's get everybody's thoughts and opinions on the top 100 games here.

01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:17.940
100 on their list.

01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:18.940
Missile Command.

01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:19.940
Yay.

01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:20.940
Missile Command was cool.

01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:21.940
Yay.

01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:22.940
It was like the Atari 2600.

01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:26.940
I have that on the 2600, 5200, a bunch of other things, and television.

01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:29.940
Wasn't that one of the ones they updated, like, way later?

01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:32.940
Yeah, there's Missile Command 2000, I think.

01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:33.940
Yeah.

01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:36.940
Number 99, XCOM UFO Defense.

01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:38.940
Um, whatever that was.

01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:45.380
And that was that game it was by microprose and you had the aliens that were it was like an alien strategy game basically

01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:52.420
Say moving on all right number 98 Frogger a

01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:58.560
Konami game yes, yeah, it always makes me think of that episode of Seinfeld

01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:02.260
I'm not even that big a fan of Seinfeld, but I will never forget that episode of Seinfeld with the Frogger

01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:06.620
It's the greatest. I've only seen one episode of Seinfeld and it was the last one

01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:12.420
They know why I went because it was at the red lion convention center by the mall and they gave out free food

01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:17.260
That's so ghetto fabulous I

01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:24.140
The only other episode I remembered three episodes of Seinfeld I remembered the grottiest one I

01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:26.620
got my his

01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:28.620
remember the Frogger one I

01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:30.300
remember the

01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:35.140
Masturbation one where they make the contest about who can go along to stop masturbating and then I remember the one

01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:40.140
Number one, where they go to a Chinese restaurant and they dare Elaine to steal an egg roll.

01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:41.140
Anyway, yeah.

01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:44.140
I don't remember the one where they all died.

01:36:44.140 --> 01:36:46.140
Oh wait, I dreamed that.

01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:51.140
Number 97, Secret of Mana.

01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:52.140
Why so low on the list?

01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:54.140
It needs to be higher, my god.

01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:55.140
I know.

01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:56.140
Fuck that.

01:36:56.140 --> 01:36:57.140
At least it wasn't Secret of Embermoor.

01:36:57.140 --> 01:36:58.140
Hey, yeah!

01:36:58.140 --> 01:36:59.140
Question!

01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:00.140
Keep going.

01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:04.140
Now, what do you think about second sense 2-3?

01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:06.140
Why didn't they ever release that here?

01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:07.140
They're going to.

01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:08.140
Are they?

01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:09.140
When?

01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:12.700
After they released the first Seiken Densetsu which was released as Final Fantasy Adventure.

01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:16.140
Is that what that Sword of Mana is that they're doing?

01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:18.220
Sword of Mana is just Seiken Densetsu 3?

01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:19.220
First one.

01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:20.860
It's the first Seiken Densetsu.

01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:21.860
Really?

01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:28.620
Which was Final Fantasy Adventure when they first released it on the Game Boy.

01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:29.620
I'll be damned.

01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:32.460
And then we're supposed to be getting Legend of Mana and I've been hearing the rumor that

01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:35.100
we're supposed to be getting Seiken 3.

01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:36.100
We better.

01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:37.100
It would make me happy.

01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:38.100
We better.

01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:40.100
That would make me as happy as a little girl.

01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:46.000
Number 96 on their list, M-U-L-E, which is a game a lot of people probably don't remember,

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.240
but if you did ever play it, this game was a shit.

01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:53.740
It was one of the first, like, multiplayer games that, um, it was just downright innovative

01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:56.300
for its time, so it's well-deserved to mention on the list.

01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:58.940
You said downright.

01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:03.000
Number 95, Golden Axe 2.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.220
You know what's funny?

01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:08.940
Golden Axe the Duel was the first game I played on the Saturn and it wasn't important.

01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:12.840
You know what I remember about Golden Axe was the ending where like it showed the people

01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:18.460
in the arcade and the heroes jumped out of the screen and trampled all the people in

01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:19.460
the arcade?

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:20.460
That was great.

01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:22.740
That was the best part about Golden Axe was the ending.

01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:25.220
Number 94 is a game I've never fucking heard of.

01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:29.020
IL-2 Stromovik

01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:31.140
93, Joust

01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:31.980
ha

01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:35.620
Joust is like one of the games I play on Ultra-Cade all the time

01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:41.340
You know what? They had the Nintendo version which was Balloon Fight

01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:43.140
Remember Balloon Fight?

01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:46.500
No. We who play Animal Crossing should have Balloon Fight. Yes, I know Balloon Fight.

01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:47.620
I'm just being difficult.

01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:52.020
92, Super Star Wars

01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:54.140
You ever play it?

01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:58.140
It's okay. I don't think it should be on the top 100 videos of all time.

01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:01.140
Super Star Wars is great because of the debug mode. You could, like, skip levels.

01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:03.140
I didn't know there was a debug mode.

01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:06.140
There is, for all three of the Star Wars games on the Super Nintendo.

01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:07.140
Well, I'll be damned.

01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:09.140
I'll have to bring over my SNES one day.

01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:10.140
Why?

01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:11.140
So you can play all the games.

01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:12.140
Can we play Act Racer?

01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:14.140
Yeah, I have it.

01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:16.140
Because Act Racer is, like, my favorite Super Nintendo game ever.

01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:17.140
Go to 4.

01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:18.140
I don't know what's on this list. I don't even know.

01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:19.140
Keep going.

01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:21.140
Spy Hunter!

01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:26.140
You know they're gonna make a movie out of Spy Hunter?

01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:28.140
That'd be kinda cool.

01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:30.140
Yes, Loki. And guess who's in it?

01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:31.140
Who?

01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:32.140
The Rock!

01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:33.140
No shit.

01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:35.140
God. It's gonna be awful.

01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:40.140
Well, I wish we could, like, spray oil and click on his limousine.

01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:43.140
Did you ever play Spy Hunter, though, that was on the, um, PS2?

01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:44.140
That was pretty rad.

01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:45.140
No, I never did.

01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:46.140
It was pretty cool.

01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:48.140
Uh, 90.

01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:55.140
3. Crash Bandicoot 3 Warped. Gag! I hate Crash Bandicoot, it looks retarded. I don't know

01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:58.900
if that's the Crash Bandicoot game I would have put it in. I feel really ripped because

01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:02.780
I bought, what was that game? It's Crash Bandicoot, it's like Crash Bandicoot's answer to Mario

01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:08.380
Party. What was it called? Crash Party? Crash Party. It's awful. I wish I would have just

01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:12.000
bought Mario Party. I wanted the Sonic Party. Huh? I wanted the Sonic Party game. I have

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.920
It's okay.

01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:18.200
I couldn't figure it out, but I'm lazy.

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:20.400
I have no attentions now whatsoever.

01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:22.600
89, Castle Wolfenstein.

01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:23.600
Yeah.

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:26.560
Now, is that referring to the original on the Apple IIe?

01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:27.560
I think not.

01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:30.600
Is it referring to the original?

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:32.040
I watched this stupid thing.

01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:35.400
It's the original one they're talking about, not Wolfenstein 3D.

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.520
Alright, fine.

01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:41.000
We have to give a nod to the original.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.720
I wouldn't put the original Wolfenstein above, like, M-U-L-E, but whatever.

01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:49.720
It was all about playing Doom and going to the Wolfenstein level by warping there.

01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:50.720
Sheesh.

01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:54.120
Uh, number 88, FIFA Soccer 2003.

01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:55.120
Whatever.

01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:56.120
Whatever.

01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:57.720
We don't talk about sports on this show.

01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:00.960
87 was Battlezone.

01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:01.960
Battlezone was cool.

01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:03.680
Remember the tank?

01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:04.680
You don't remember Battlezone?

01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:05.680
I didn't play Battlezone.

01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:07.240
It was a vector game and you were in the tank?

01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:09.000
Was it on the Vectrex?

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000
I think it might have been.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
It was Atari's game.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
You know we've been looking for a Vectrex.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Really?

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Yeah.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000
I wouldn't doubt it.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Uh, 86.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Oh, it smells like fabric softener.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Oh, no wonder.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
And thank God this game made the list.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
86 was Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Amen.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.000
This must have, no that was Gem Fighter.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Did they have, not Gem, but Pocket Fighter, they have a second one out now.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.000
When are they going to release a new version of Puzzle Fighter?

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
That's the game they need to take online.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Forget DDR.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000
You know what's awesome?

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:41.560
puzzle fighter the one that's on the Dreamcast that was awesome because

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:46.160
there's like a columns mode in it as well as another type of mode in there

01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:50.120
it's just like three different modes XYZ mode as well plus it had those

01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:57.760
Sakura vocal song in there 85 Prince of Persia I know Prince of Persia was so

01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:03.680
like overrated. You had to ask all over your old gaming magazines to this day. Oh my god and how many freaking

01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:04.680
Game systems?

01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:05.680
Was that game on?

01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:06.680
All of them.

01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:07.680
All of them.

01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:11.120
You could not, if you owned a game system of anything you could get Prince of Persia.

01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:13.600
Uh, 84 was Asteroids.

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:14.600
Yeah.

01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:15.600
Next.

01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:16.600
83.

01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:17.600
Daytona USA.

01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:18.600
Daytona.

01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:23.560
I never even played that.

01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:25.680
What do you love about Daytona, Logie?

01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:30.440
It's fun and a lot of the arcades, especially the ones like in Reno and stuff, they've got

01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:35.720
like 16 machines hooked together, so it's like one hell of a race, and normally they're

01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:39.400
like huge lap settings, so you're like racing about 12 people and stuff.

01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:43.400
I have nightmares though about that game for one reason. I worked in an arcade where they

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:52.400
never turned off the attract for that game. I'm like, oh god, make it stop. You know there

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:56.560
was actually a really funny penny arcade to that? I don't remember where exactly it was,

01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:02.680
was one of the older ones from a couple of years ago. And I remember Gabe, but the other

01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:08.560
guy was sitting down at the computer and Gabe walks up and goes, doo doo doo doo doo day

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:14.120
tone, and the other guy reaches over and grabs out his heart. He goes ahhh! Like that. Oh

01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:21.120
my lord. Uh, 82, ghouls and ghosts. Yes! Freaking Makai Mora. 81, gauntlet. Red Valkyrie is

01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:24.120
81, Gauntlet.

01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:30.120
Red Valkyrie is about to die. Remember, don't shoot the hosts.

01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:32.560
80, Silent Hill 2.

01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:34.660
Hey, Yamaoka Music.

01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:35.920
Right on.

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:39.640
How far do we want to take this list? Let's keep going. Keep going.

01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:42.180
79, King's Quest. Next.

01:43:42.180 --> 01:43:47.820
King's Quest was awesome. This should have been in the top ten. King's Quest was boring. I'm sorry, King's Quest should have been in the top ten.

01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:49.820
It's one of the most innovative video games on the list.

01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:51.820
Maniac Mansion better be on that list.

01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:52.820
Sierra games from the 90s.

01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:54.820
Maniac Mansion better be on that list. Next.

01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:55.820
I don't know if it is.

01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:56.820
It's not.

01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:58.820
This freakin' dolts.

01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:02.820
But if there had been no King's Quest, there would have never been a Maniac Mansion.

01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:04.820
Um, whatever.

01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:06.820
78, Defender.

01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:08.820
Okay, next.

01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:10.820
77, Saturn Bomberman.

01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:12.820
Yes! Oh my god, yes.

01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:15.820
I love Saturn Bomberman and I could not find a copy.

01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:22.820
Actually, you know what was really good? The Bomberman games on the, um, on the, uh, Turbo Graphics.

01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:26.820
Bomberman 93, Bomberman 94. Those were good.

01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:30.820
Okay, we had a request from the chat room to just skip ahead to 50.

01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:31.320
Okay.

01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:32.820
You want me to read the rest of these really fast?

01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:33.320
Yeah.

01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:37.820
Okay, give your, Jamie, you're gonna give your one word reaction to each of these games as I name them off, okay?

01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:38.820
Oh, God.

01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:41.820
Here we go, super fast forward here. 75, Wave Race 64.

01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:42.820
Next.

01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:58.320
Which one?

01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:00.320
The one that's gonna piss you off.

01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:02.320
It's like a puzzle bobble, you bitches!

01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:05.320
No, no. I'm almost positive. Aren't they talking about...

01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:07.320
Oh, no, they are talking about puzzle bobble in that case.

01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:08.320

But I have it on Saturn.

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:14.320

01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:17.320
What? Forget it. Forget it.

01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:20.320
They're talking about Puzzle Bubble and Busta Move.

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:22.320
Were they talking about Groove or what?

01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:24.320
They're talking about Puzzle Bubble.

That's more than one word.

01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:55.320
I don't care.

01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:56.320
63, R-Type.

01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:57.320
R-Type?

01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:58.320
62.

01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:01.320

01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:06.320

Let's do the speed thing all the way to 20, okay?

01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:11.320
Alright.

01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:13.320
Oh, I can't wait for this one.

01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:18.320

01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:19.320
Best game.

01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:20.320
47, Tron.

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:21.320
Hee!

01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:22.320
40, I, wait!

01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:23.320
Go back to 48!

01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:24.320
Chrono Trigger!

01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:25.320
Why so fucking low?

01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:26.320
That's a-

01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:27.320
They have fucking retards.

01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:28.320
DOLT!

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:29.320
Hey, that's my word.

01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:30.320
47, Tron.

01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:31.320
46, Unreal.

01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:32.320
Hey, that's not rude.

01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:33.320
47 Tron.

01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:34.320

01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:35.320

01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:42.320
Whatever.

01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:43.320
What?

01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:45.320
How does a game like that get above Chrono Trigger?

01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:47.320
Because retards made this list.

01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:48.320
God!

01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:49.320
Oof!

01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:50.320
And then this one.

01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:51.320
NHL 93.

01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:52.320
What the fuck ever.

01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:53.320
At 43.

01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:54.320
42 Quake II.

01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:55.320
Hey!

01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:58.320
Quake II has a gachapon patch to it.

01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:00.320
41 Deus Ex.

01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:03.320
40, Dance Dance Revolution

01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:07.320
Why so high?

01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:14.320
39, beating out Dance Dance Revolution, Mortal Kombat 2

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:21.320
Actually I like Mortal Kombat 2 because I liked playing on the beta kits

01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:24.320
where you could do the infinite juggles and float

01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:27.320
and start off your game against Shao Kahn

01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:30.320
Um, where the hell was I?

01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:32.320
I was in high school.

01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:35.320
38, Sonic the Hedgehog.

01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:38.320
37, SimCity.

01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:40.320
36, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell.

01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:42.320
Whatever, I hate Tom Clancy games.

01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:44.320
35, Battlefield 1942.

01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:49.320
34, this is a good pick, Ultima IV, Quest of the Avatar.

01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:51.320
33, Duke Nukem 3D.

01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:53.320
Your face, your ass, what's the difference?

01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:55.320
32, Tekken 2.

01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:58.520
Hey, Tekken 2 had June in it. I love that game.

01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:06.520
31, Diablo 2, 30, Mario Kart 64, 29, Medal of Honor, Allied Assault, 28, Galaga.

01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:08.320
Hey, it's Galaga.

01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:13.320
27, Monkey Island 2, LeChuck's Revenge.

01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:17.120
26, Command and Conquer, Red Alert.

01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:17.920
Whatever.

01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:20.620
25, Star Wars X, Wing Alliance.

01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:21.420
Neat.

01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:24.220
24, Castlevania, Symphony of the Night.

01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:25.420
Oh my god, yes!

01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:27.420
That should be one.

01:49:27.420 --> 01:49:29.220
Twenty-three, Metal Gear Solid.

01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:30.020
Yes.

01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:31.720
Twenty-two, Resident Evil.

01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:32.520
Yeah.

01:49:32.620 --> 01:49:34.020
Twenty-one, EverQuest.

01:49:34.620 --> 01:49:37.420
Gag, gag, gag, kill it, die.

01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:42.720
Okay, now that the others are back, we can slow this down a little bit to really rant about the top twenty.

01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:47.220
So, I know Brad has a few things he wants to say about some of the ones he heard just coming in the door.

01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:50.720
Brad?

01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:53.220
What is this big thing?

01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:57.220
This, by the way, is G4 Entertainment Weekly's list of top 100 games of all time.

01:49:57.220 --> 01:50:04.220
Okay, I've read so many of these lists over the years, and I already know when they do these top 100 things, that they get really lazy and they kind of just...

01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:10.220
Because you can't really concentrate on every little thing, so they just start splashing games here and there because they don't know where to put them.

01:50:10.220 --> 01:50:14.220
My opinion about some of these games being at like 24, 25, whatever it was,

01:50:14.220 --> 01:50:27.220
Castlevania Civilian Knight, in my opinion, should be up there in the top 5 at least, but I haven't read what their other top 19 or 18 or 20 is, so I don't know why they're thinking these other games. Do they have explanations for why these games should be in the top 20?

01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:30.220
If you watch the show, but we're not endorsing that.

01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:31.220
Good.

01:50:31.220 --> 01:50:34.220
Okay. Well, as I name off these top 20...

01:50:34.220 --> 01:50:36.220
Your solid should also be up in the top 5, but whatever.

01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:40.940
But whatever as I name off these top 20 you can you can tell us if they were deserving Brad

01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:44.700
You'll be the you can be the critic on if they're deserving of being in the top 20. Okay, Brad

01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:47.580
Where'd the ice queen go?

01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:50.420
Okay

01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:54.180
All right, here we go, I don't need a quarter

01:50:56.060 --> 01:51:00.280
Here we go kids number 20 super Metroid

01:51:01.060 --> 01:51:02.740
dude, god, yeah

01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:04.740
number 20 super Metroid, um

01:51:04.740 --> 01:51:14.740
Definitely deserving of being in the top 20, but I don't know if it should be at the lowest of the top 20. I don't know what the other games are, so.

01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:17.740
Excellent game, though. Definitely should be in the top 20.

01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:19.740
19, Ms. Pac-Man.

01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:20.740
What?

01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:22.740
If you're talk- What?

01:51:22.740 --> 01:51:27.740
If you're talking of all time, come on, Ms. Pac-Man of all time.

01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:28.740
No.

01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:29.740
Yes.

01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:30.740
I'm sorry.

01:51:30.740 --> 01:51:31.740
Yes.

01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:32.740
Deserving of top 20.

01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:37.740
is so, has so little gameplay comparing to something like Super Metroid.

01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:42.140
It should be, it should be in the top 100, but maybe like at 99.

01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:43.100
That's sad.

01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:45.460
If you were ten years older you would not say that.

01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:48.420
What the fuck? I remember when it came out. I know.

01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:52.620
But that was the game that everybody was playing in the arcade, like now it's... It doesn't matter.

01:51:52.620 --> 01:51:57.300
The game itself, as far as gameplay is concerned, that's the reason why we play video games, because they're fun.

01:51:57.300 --> 01:52:02.800
And Ms. Pac-Man is not nearly as fun as something that has as much gameplay as Symphony Night or Super Metroid.

01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:07.800
I don't care if it's, oh, it brings you back to your past or whatever. It's still not as fun.

01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:09.800
I don't think it has anything to do with that.

01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:12.800
If that's what it does to me, then you're playing video games for the wrong reason in my opinion.

01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:16.300
Yeah, but do you own a magazine? I don't think so, so, huh?

01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:19.800
And I will. And it'll be very Nazi-ish.

01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:22.800
Um, no Ms. Pac-Man for you.

01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:24.800
I like baby Pac-Man.

01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:29.800
Number 18, Soul Calibur.

01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:31.800
Yes, Soul Calibur, yes.

01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:35.800
But you can't forget the Soul Edge.

01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:37.800
Which is not on the list, I can tell you.

01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:41.800
I think the reason why they would put that up there as far as...

01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:44.800
because Soul Calibur, they're probably talking about the console version.

01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:51.800
It kind of pushed the fighting game on the console to...

01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:54.800
It pushed the envelope on it. It gave you a lot more extra features.

01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:57.800
It was kind of one of the first things, the big ones, to do that.

01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:02.800
And Soul Edge was a great game on the console, but Soul Calibur really pushed it to the limit.

01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:05.800
One thing to consider also, when they brought out Soul Calibur on the Dreamcast,

01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:08.800
the graphics were better than the arcade version.

01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:12.800
Which is like, had never been done before.

01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:16.800
Exactly, and that's probably one of the reasons why it's up there.

01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:19.800
at least it's still caliber to make it look like a Dreamcast version.

01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:49.800
Exactly! Matt knows what I'm talking about.

01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:51.800
No, I think...

01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:53.800
I want Striperella the game.

01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:59.800
Hold on, hold on. As silly as Matt's kind of being joking, it's kind of true.

01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:04.800
A big-breasted, like a female who kicked ass in a video game and became like an icon.

01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:10.800
Basically like the logo for the Playstation for a while was Lara Croft.

01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:15.800
I mean, I hate the game, but it did do something huge to...

01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:22.800
And that probably sounds hypocritical because I said it like Ms. Pac-Man because it's not fun.

01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:31.800
That was actually what I was going to say because, and I preempted it, because Ms. Pac-Man, well actually not Ms. Pac-Man so much as Pac-Man.

01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:35.800
In the sense of Tomb Raider 2 you could blow her up and throw her off the balcony and make her break her neck.

01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:44.800
Here's another thing, in Ms. Pac-Man you can't swan dive off a 30 story cliff and kill yourself, but you can do that in Tomb Raider and that's what makes Tomb Raider fun.

01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:48.800
We get to see her with her broken neck.

01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:52.800
Uh, moving on. 16, Halo.

01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:56.800
I haven't played it, so I guess I'm not a true gamer. 15, and this-

01:54:56.800 --> 01:55:00.800
Wait, Halo is freaking gorgeous, and actually, I can probably say that yeah.

01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:04.800
They should be up there. You've played a few FPSes, I believe.

01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:08.800
First person shooters, right?

01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:12.800
Um, I- hold on, I need to get-

01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:17.800
Jamie, I need to get something. I think you've played quite a few first person shooters before, right?

01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:24.800
So you know the differences. I've never played Halo, so what's so great about Halo that makes it different than other first person shooters?

01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:31.800
It's just really interactive, very responsive, and you've got so many different levels you can play on and you can play it in different ways.

01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:41.800
Plus when you play multiplayer, you can play cooperatively with another person instead of having, excuse me, deathmatch and like burping up.

01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:50.800
Anyway, but on top of that, it's really pretty, I mean really pretty, and it really shows what the Xbox can do, honestly.

01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:56.800
And for me, even though Xbox isn't my favorite system, I'd have to say that yeah, that has to be up there.

01:55:56.800 --> 01:55:58.800
And by the way, if Steel Battalion's not on the list, I'm going to scream.

01:55:58.800 --> 01:55:59.800
It's not.

01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:03.800
Okay, moving on to number 15.

01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:08.800
And this is a game I think should be in the top three, but it's not, but whatever.

01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:10.800
15, Civilization II.

01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:12.800
What, um, yeah.

01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:16.800
The greatest strategy game on the computer of all time. Period.

01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:18.800
Get a rope?

01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:29.800
No, Matt's saying get a rope. Um, Civilization 2 may not be my type of game, but I've seen, I like Civilization 1.

01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:37.800
I guess I wasn't as much into strategy games as I am, like adventure stuff, but I could see how it's so good because I did like Civilization 1 for a while.

01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:45.800
Then it started to grade on me or whatever, but, I don't know, Sid Meier, I mean, he's just, I guess he's a genius when it comes to making strategy games, simulation games and stuff, so.

01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:51.800
I think also, Civilization can kind of be seen, this is the way I look at it, it's, um, strategy games for dummies.

01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:56.800
It's a very accessible kind of game. Like, you don't really have to be into strategy games to play them.

01:56:56.800 --> 01:57:02.800
Well, that's what I'm saying, Sid Meier kind of makes his games kind of user-friendly, even though they have a lot of strategy involved.

01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:11.800
You can get into it even if you're kind of, I mean, like the Sims, it can get pretty complicated, but it's pretty actually, it shows you how to play pretty easily.

01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:12.800
Alright, moving on.

01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:16.800
Fourteen. Tony Hawk's pro skater.

01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:18.800
Yeah, I'd have to say so.

01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:25.800
Changed the face of skateboard games forever. I mean, skateboard games, whatever. I need her to die.

01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:29.800
Skate or die should be above, hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:31.800
In my opinion, or 720.

01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:33.800
Menace Beach. Menace Beach.

01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:36.800
720. 720, hey, that's cool.

01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:39.800
Um, no, PNC Surf Designs.

01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:40.800
Yeah.

01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:44.800
Um, no, but seriously, to me there basically are only two skateboard games,

01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:47.800
Tony Hawk Bros Skater and Skater Die, so...

01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:50.800
That goes to show you how good Tony Hawk is.

01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:55.800
Come on, 720, what other game do you get chased by bees?

01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:56.800
Again...

01:57:56.800 --> 01:58:00.800
Didn't that happen in Paperboy? Shut up.

01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:01.800
No, Paperboy's not on the list.

01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:02.800
God, Paperboy's not on the list?

01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:03.800
They're Crystal Castles?

01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:04.800
No.

01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:05.800
Marvel Madness?

01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:06.800
Nope.

01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:07.800
Those retards.

01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:08.800
Okay, here we go.

01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:10.800
13, Gran Turismo.

01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:11.800
Oh.

01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:16.800
Again, changed totally the course of racing games.

01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:23.680
And all the, not just realistic driving engine, but like, such a design, you know, aspect,

01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:27.800
like fine-tuning your cars and everything, it being like the main reason to even play

01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:28.800
the game.

01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:35.800
changed the direction.

01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:03.800
But that was to mean the whole Final Fantasy series.

01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:06.800
If they meant the whole series, if they truly meant that, that's forgivable.

01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:13.800
But I think they said Final Fantasy VII probably because more people know about Final Fantasy VII than any other Final Fantasy, because it really changed.

01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:19.800
One thing about Final Fantasy VII is that it brought it into, I guess, the modern age of games.

01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:27.800
and it right and it was mostly although although I have to say though that it

01:59:27.800 --> 01:59:32.380
was now that I've gone back to play it again I'm still hoping that they did the

01:59:32.380 --> 01:59:35.460
rumor proves out true and that they do an updated version because it would

01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:42.620
really benefit from it sorry we can't hear ice cream because he has no mic um

01:59:42.620 --> 01:59:52.700
What were you saying Matt?

01:59:52.700 --> 01:59:58.740
What I was saying for anybody that cares was that Final Fantasy 7 was really, really good

01:59:58.740 --> 02:00:04.020
just because of the fact that it revolutionized the eye candy for Final Fantasy.

02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:05.020
It was the first eye candy.

02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:09.180
It doesn't look very good now, but for its time it looked really, really good.

02:00:09.180 --> 02:00:12.420
And it had really good backgrounds, yeah.

02:00:12.420 --> 02:00:30.420
The thing that the people that are like kind of like gaming purists or Final Fantasy 6 purists or whatever would say is that that's a bad thing that revolutionized the eye candy thing because Squaresoft for a while started going only for the cinematics and the eye candy for a while and they just forgot about gameplay when it comes to like Final Fantasy 8.

02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:33.420
That's my opinion.

02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:34.420
Exactly.

02:00:34.420 --> 02:00:35.420
Jamie says 10 was good.

02:00:35.420 --> 02:00:40.420
I think they kind of went back to mixing the gameplay with the cinematics.

02:00:40.420 --> 02:00:45.420
There was something I was going to say.

02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:48.420
Do you want me to, can I elaborate on the Final Fantasy VII Remake thing?

02:00:48.420 --> 02:00:49.420
Keep going, yeah.

02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:54.420
Okay. Jamie was saying she really hopes the rumor about Final Fantasy VII Remake on PS2 is true.

02:00:54.420 --> 02:01:00.420
They did an interview with, well actually Squaresoft posted something to the users about it.

02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:05.420
We've started to make sequels to Final Fantasies with Final Fantasy X-2 coming out.

02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:07.420
Which other games would you like there to be a sequel to?

02:01:07.420 --> 02:01:10.420
Overwhelmingly, people said Final Fantasy VII.

02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:12.420
Squaresoft rebutled by saying,

02:01:12.420 --> 02:01:17.420
we don't have the time or effort to remake the engine for Final Fantasy VII.

02:01:17.420 --> 02:01:21.420
Of course, everybody said, use X2's engine. We use whatever.

02:01:21.420 --> 02:01:25.420
Now, so, if that's true, that they don't have the time, money, or effort to make it,

02:01:25.420 --> 02:01:27.420
they're not going to be able to remake Final Fantasy VII.

02:01:27.420 --> 02:01:32.420
But there was a rumor, and it was confirmed that eventually they were going to remake Final Fantasy VII.

02:01:32.420 --> 02:01:33.420
So, I don't know.

02:01:33.420 --> 02:01:36.420
Squaresoft's got their head up their asses now, so who knows?

02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:43.420
Alright. Moving on to the list. I'll just say it, number 11 is GoldenEye 007.

02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:49.420
That game was actually pretty good, but that game actually did make me throw up.

02:01:49.420 --> 02:01:57.420
I don't care if it's the best Nintendo 64 game ever made, it's undeserving of being in the top 20 in my opinion.

02:01:57.420 --> 02:02:07.420
The way it got up there is because if it wasn't for that game, Halo wouldn't be around, because it did make first person shooters on the console a popular thing.

02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:10.420
Especially multiplayer first person shooters on the console.

02:02:10.420 --> 02:02:13.420
That's because there was nothing else on the console.

02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:21.420
No, before all there was, you had to have a computer and a LAN, you know, to play multiplayer shooters.

02:02:21.420 --> 02:02:25.420
And then all of a sudden here comes Nintendo 64 with their only good game besides Zelda.

02:02:25.420 --> 02:02:27.420
What about Faceball 2000?

02:02:27.420 --> 02:02:29.420
Faceball?

02:02:29.420 --> 02:02:31.420
That was all I wanted to know.

02:02:31.420 --> 02:02:33.420
Yeah, but it was a multiplayer game.

02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:35.420
Have a nice day.

02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:37.420
Sadly enough, I played through the whole game of it.

02:02:37.420 --> 02:02:39.420
I weep for you.

02:02:39.420 --> 02:02:43.420
Speaking of, you know what I wish they had done?

02:02:43.420 --> 02:02:47.420
I wish that they had actually done the Satellaview games in the States.

02:02:47.420 --> 02:02:49.420
The Satellaview games.

02:02:49.420 --> 02:02:53.420
If you look on the bottom of your screen for Nintendo, there's this thing that will pull out.

02:02:53.420 --> 02:02:58.220
out that's where a modem was supposed to go why isn't north and south on that list

02:03:00.860 --> 02:03:04.380
yes they should have done the modem thing because they had the best version of zelda of

02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:10.460
zelda on that all right moving on i'm going to try to kind of jam through this list because we have

02:03:10.460 --> 02:03:17.900
we have some other segments left we got to do um number 10 was street fighter 2 yes next brad

02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:23.900
Hey, Street Fighter II started my first fangirl crush, other than Jed Nelson.

02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:26.900
It was Ryu. Hello.

02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:28.900
Street Fighter II is what got me into arcades.

02:03:28.900 --> 02:03:32.900
Okay, Street Fighter II is a great game. I love it, I always will.

02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:38.900
But it kinda is, to me, kinda like the Ms. Pac-Man thing I said.

02:03:38.900 --> 02:03:42.900
It started a new type of game.

02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:48.900
A lot of people say that Street Fighter II is the, I guess you'd say the pong of our generation.

02:03:48.900 --> 02:03:49.900
The pong?

02:03:49.900 --> 02:03:52.900
Pong, not bong.

02:03:52.900 --> 02:03:55.900
Because it really got our generation into the arcades.

02:03:55.900 --> 02:04:01.900
But the fighting genre has been changed so much over the years and in good ways.

02:04:01.900 --> 02:04:04.900
There's so many better fighting games in Street Fighter II.

02:04:04.900 --> 02:04:07.900
But it is deserving of being on that list.

02:04:07.900 --> 02:04:16.900
It's one of those things where it's kind of more of a nod to the genre, like Ms. Pac-Man was, like there would be no maze game without, but in that case they should have put Pac-Man, not Ms. Pac-Man, but whatever.

02:04:16.900 --> 02:04:20.900
Yeah, so I agree that it should be at the, near the top of the list, but...

02:04:21.900 --> 02:04:26.900
Oh! Loki thinks, Loki thinks they put Ms. Pac-Man on the list because it got girls to play games.

02:04:26.900 --> 02:04:28.900
Well that's what they said in the goddamn show!

02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:29.900
Whatever.

02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:37.300
Well, the whole thing about Street Fighter 2 is that it was so widely popular that it

02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:42.740
really blew the doors open, and the thing is, when I actually bought my own Super Nintendo,

02:04:42.740 --> 02:04:45.980
the first game I got was Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo.

02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:47.940
That was my game.

02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:51.500
And I was such a Ryu fangirl, and I still am.

02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:54.340
I used E. Honda because he was fat like me.

02:04:54.340 --> 02:04:55.340
Okay.

02:04:55.340 --> 02:04:56.980
Number 9.

02:04:56.980 --> 02:05:07.540
Starcraft and Warcraft. If I have to play another RTS game, I will put a gun to my head

02:05:07.540 --> 02:05:15.020
and pull the trigger. I don't like real time strategy games. And they did not, how could

02:05:15.020 --> 02:05:19.020
you say Starcraft and Warcraft? I think they should be in the top 20 but not above Civilization.

02:05:19.020 --> 02:05:24.220
Oh hell no. Dude, fucking Red Alert, that game rocks. I love Command and Conquer. No,

02:05:24.220 --> 02:05:28.420
Command & Conquer Ghost will be a lot better, but that's a first-person shooting, so moving on.

02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:32.740
The only red alert that's cool is the transformer.

02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:37.120
Number eight.

02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:40.080
Another series, Super Mario 64.

02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:47.420
That was actually very fun. Dan and I, when I first moved in with Dan, we would just spend hours all night playing Mario 64.

02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:50.060
Like trying to do the special jump to get to the roof.

02:05:50.060 --> 02:05:59.060
I agree with definitely with putting Mario in the top ten. I actually think it ought to be higher, but I don't agree with the game they highlighted.

02:05:59.060 --> 02:06:02.060
And it started up Mario Sunshine. We wouldn't have Mario Sunshine without it.

02:06:02.060 --> 02:06:08.060
I agree, but I think Mario Brothers 3 is the one they should have kind of picked to lead the pack. I think that was the best Mario game they made.

02:06:08.060 --> 02:06:12.060
See, I feel like Mario World better than Mario 3.

02:06:12.060 --> 02:06:22.060
Hold on, hold on, hold on, yes, Matt's saying Super Mario 64 and Sunshine are different.

02:06:22.060 --> 02:06:29.060
Okay, here's why Jamie made the comparison.

02:06:29.060 --> 02:06:36.060
Because Super Mario, as in Super Mario on Nintendo, is an original platform side-scorer game.

02:06:36.060 --> 02:06:40.060
Whereas Mario 64 is a 3D platformer and it plays differently.

02:06:40.060 --> 02:06:45.060
The idea is similar, but it plays completely differently because it's in a 3D realm.

02:06:45.060 --> 02:06:48.060
And because of Mario 64 we have games like, uh, Monkey...

02:06:48.060 --> 02:06:50.060
What's it called? That PlayStation game? Super Monkey Ball?

02:06:50.060 --> 02:06:51.060
Ape Escape.

02:06:51.060 --> 02:06:52.060
Oh.

02:06:52.060 --> 02:06:55.060
Ape Escape. Another 3D platformer game. It's like Jak and Daxter, I think.

02:06:55.060 --> 02:06:57.060
And, like, these games that are pretty popular, I hear.

02:06:57.060 --> 02:06:58.060
Spyro.

02:06:58.060 --> 02:07:01.060
Spyro. I didn't really like Spyro, but it is popular.

02:07:01.060 --> 02:07:05.060
You know, everyone always forgets about what Mario is missing.

02:07:05.060 --> 02:07:07.060
Because that game is so fast!

02:07:07.060 --> 02:07:09.060
Do you know what that is?

02:07:09.060 --> 02:07:10.060
Do you know what that is?

02:07:10.060 --> 02:07:12.060
It's Nintendo's version of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego

02:07:12.060 --> 02:07:15.060
and it's a bad interpretation of it.

02:07:15.060 --> 02:07:17.060
Alright, we gotta move on with this list.

02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:20.060
I hate to say it, but if we don't get through this list

02:07:20.060 --> 02:07:22.060
we're not going to be able to get the FUs of the week.

02:07:22.060 --> 02:07:24.060
Oh my god, no way!

02:07:24.060 --> 02:07:26.060
Okay, I know, we haven't even done the FUs of the week yet.

02:07:26.060 --> 02:07:28.060
So, number seven.

02:07:28.060 --> 02:07:30.060
This is, I want to see Brad's reaction to this.

02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:32.060
Number seven, The Sims.

02:07:32.060 --> 02:07:35.360
Number seven?

02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:40.760
And I actually agree with this. I agree with it because it's the top selling computer game of all time.

02:07:40.760 --> 02:07:45.400
Period. I mean, and it's accessible to everybody.

02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:48.960
It's a video game that has no limits.

02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:52.560
Literally. I mean, boys, girls, men, women,

02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:55.920
children, everybody can play this game. It's very accessible and everybody has fun with it.

02:07:55.920 --> 02:08:00.480
The only problem with The Sims is that it has no goal. There's no objective, but in a way

02:08:00.480 --> 02:08:04.480
That's kind of the appeal of it. It kind of made way for games like Animal Crossing.

02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:09.480
Isn't that all Sid Meier's games? They have no goal. Not even Civilization has a goal.

02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:11.480
Sid Meier did not do the Sims, if I'm not mistaken.

02:08:11.480 --> 02:08:12.480
Are you serious?

02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:18.480
Let me elaborate on that. They actually, the PC versions have no goal.

02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:22.480
No, overall your goal obviously would be no successful and whatever.

02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:27.480
But in the console versions, they do have goal-oriented things in there.

02:08:27.480 --> 02:08:32.480
Because, obviously, you're limited to what you can hold on the console and stuff.

02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:34.480
Huh? Did you say my name?

02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:36.480
Alright. Here we go.

02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:39.480
Number 6. Half-Life.

02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:42.480
Any comments?

02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:44.480
Okay, I played Half-Life.

02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:46.480
Half-Life isn't that good.

02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:48.480
Hold on, Matt's saying Half-Life isn't that good.

02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:53.480
Half-Life kind of, it changed first person shooters.

02:08:53.480 --> 02:09:18.480
After Half-Life, these games started coming out kind of like, I think System Shock 2 and stuff came out after Half-Life, I can't remember, somebody could probably call me on that, and they started becoming more story-oriented, you know, have to do, you had to think more instead of just straight on, you know, look and shoot, kill things, you had to kind of more think in a problem-solving way, you know? I don't know if I would put it that high on the list.

02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:23.480
I think it's way too high on the list, especially considering the number of other FPSs they have on the list

02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:27.480
because there's another one still on the list we haven't gotten to yet.

02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:32.480
Number five, this is an interesting choice, but I suppose you have to have a sports game somewhere in the top ten.

02:09:32.480 --> 02:09:34.480
Matt in 2003.

02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:39.480
I'm sorry, super high impact football is better.

02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:42.480
We're spending way much time on this game, go to the next one.

02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:45.480
None of us play sports games, give me a fucking break.

02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:47.480
Tecmo Bowl. Enough said.

02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:49.480
No, no. Tecmo Bowl and Super High Impact.

02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:52.480
NBA Jam, I think is the only one I ate.

02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:54.480
NBA Jam 10 seconds earlier.

02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:57.480
The only sports game I ever played was NFL Blitz.

02:09:57.480 --> 02:09:59.480
Blitz was actually kind of funny.

02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:00.480
What's that?

02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:01.480
Blitz was kind of funny.

02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:03.480
Wait, wait, wait. That's the only reason I played it.

02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:05.480
Super Tennis on Super Nintendo. I did play that.

02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:09.480
Alright, moving on. Here we go.

02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:12.480
Uh, getting down to that wire. Number 4, Grand Theft Auto 3.

02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:17.480
Yeah, that has to be on there. It was pretty unique.

02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:23.480
It's again the series highlighted by one game. And Vice City is just 3's engine, isn't it?

02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:28.480
Vice City is a little bit different. The engine, they upgraded the graphics a bit.

02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:34.480
And they changed... I don't know, I guess it is the same engine. Maybe they just...

02:10:34.480 --> 02:10:38.480
I don't know. Unlimited some things in the graphics.

02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:46.960
number three Tetris I almost think I almost think it ought to be number one

02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:53.920
I'll say it I'll say it since you know I'm gonna leave now goodbye so weird

02:10:53.920 --> 02:11:00.760
without that we wouldn't have tetranet I ran I ran something to contribute yes I

02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:04.880
kind of think that's why mrs. pac-man was so high on the list because it has

02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:08.880
kind of the same appeal as Tetris where you could play it over and over and over

02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:12.840
it's different every time you know you don't have to worry about graphics or

02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:16.160
anything like that it's something you could take with you to work and play and

02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:19.560
you don't have to immerse yourself into a story or anything it's just pick up

02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:23.780
and go and it's the same as Tetris you know also if I'm not mistaken out of the

02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:27.120
hundred games on this list this is one of only two puzzle games on the whole

02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:35.440
list, Puzzle Fighter II. But how many puzzle games did Tetris influence? Columns? What

02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:43.120
was the one I'm thinking of? Besides Puzzle Fighter, there was... But I'm not really disappointed

02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:52.400
with what they put as number one, so... Magical Drop. Alright. Moving on, number two, I promise

02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:57.680
there'd be another FPS on here before we got to the end. Doom. Yes, because I would come

02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:06.680
home from school and go back to Marcy's house and we would play Doom all night. And I think

02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:14.520
because this game is here, Half-Life should not be on this list at all. Yeah. And I question

02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:20.160
Halo's presence. Hold on. Half-Life puts more of a story into it and I think that's why

02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:26.800
they put it there but that does make you question halo being there halo is the

02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:30.880
most successful xbox game is what matt says uh matt loki matt

02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:34.960
hold on here's the thing i see what they're doing here on this list they're

02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:38.000
going by genre it's like they're cycling through genre games and which ones are

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:43.200
the best in the genre we might as well have just a top 20 games in each genre

02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:46.480
that would have been more of a better idea but whatever

02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:53.480
Number one, and obviously somebody can guess this because it hasn't been named yet. Let Irene.

02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:55.640
And it is...

02:12:55.640 --> 02:12:57.160
Drum roll, please.

02:12:57.160 --> 02:13:00.120
A boy and his Bob!

02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:01.500
That's my choice, but

02:13:01.500 --> 02:13:05.960
it's The Legend of Zelda. Can you guess which game in the series they chose to highlight?

02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:08.120
The original. No.

02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:14.720
Link to the past. Really? Link to the past. Oh, I thought you told me the original. Nope, you lied. I just heard you tell me the original.

02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:15.720
I totally guessed it.

02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:20.720
And I'm okay with Tetris not being number one because Zelda's, you know, God.

02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:22.720
Link to the Past was the best of the series.

02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:25.720
And I agree, Link to the Past was the best of the series, period.

02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:28.720
I think it's better than Ocarina of Time, even, and I think...

02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:31.720
Well, I have to say Ocarina of Time...

02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:35.720
Give Ice Queen a mic, please.

02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:39.720
I have to say that Ocarina of Time was about equal to the Link of the Past,

02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:43.720
but this new freaking Zelda that's out compared to these other two sucks ass.

02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:49.820
it's good in its own way but not as a Zelda yes I did it's good in its own way

02:13:49.820 --> 02:13:53.260
it's got a good story but you're a freaking treasure hunter the whole

02:13:53.260 --> 02:13:59.020
freaking game you're a goddamn treasure hunter I'm sorry but that is not Zelda

02:13:59.020 --> 02:14:02.740
you have to get all the pieces of the thing so you can get through dungeons

02:14:02.740 --> 02:14:07.360
let's make sure we keep it spoiler free it's actually a direct sequel to

02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:12.060
spoiler I know just just a reminder spoiler it's a direct it's a direct

02:14:12.060 --> 02:14:13.860
sequel to Ocarina of Time.

02:14:13.860 --> 02:14:17.580
Well, that was Mask of Majora, wasn't it? No, that's sort of the alternate universe.

02:14:17.580 --> 02:14:22.860
Oh, and Mask of Majora is just... It was shit. It was shit.

02:14:22.860 --> 02:14:26.260
I think I probably had the most fun playing out of all the Zeldas.

02:14:26.260 --> 02:14:27.680
Probably playing the, uh,

02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:29.900
oracle games on Game Boy.

02:14:29.900 --> 02:14:32.340
No, I'm sad about the whole, you know,

02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:34.300
the way they did this Legend of Zelda.

02:14:34.300 --> 02:14:36.020
Imagine, you know,

02:14:36.020 --> 02:14:39.380
Legends I'll link to the past storyline with the graphics

02:14:39.380 --> 02:14:40.740
of Wind Waker.

02:14:40.740 --> 02:14:45.740
That's what I was imagining that I wanted out of this game.

02:14:45.740 --> 02:14:50.180
Well, there's still time for them to make a new one that's like that.

02:14:50.180 --> 02:14:54.260
They were going in kind of a different direction as to the way the gameplay flows and everything in this one.

02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:58.660
They wanted to go for more of an anime-style drama-type story.

02:14:58.660 --> 02:15:02.140
And I really, really like this one, and it probably is my favorite of the...

02:15:02.140 --> 02:15:06.540
It is my favorite of the 3D Zeldas, but...

02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:09.580
Different type of game, in my opinion.

02:15:09.580 --> 02:15:16.580
The biggest problem, and this isn't going to be a spoiler, it might be a little bit, but the biggest problem is the fact that there are so few dungeons.

02:15:16.580 --> 02:15:21.580
That's the thing that killed this Zelda for me. There's no dungeons!

02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:27.580
Yeah, that's great, but I spent like three hours in one of the dungeons once, so I don't care if there's four, five, six dungeons.

02:15:27.580 --> 02:15:31.580
I mean, that was a long time to spend in one dungeon. You know what though?

02:15:31.580 --> 02:15:35.580
In Ocarina of Time, if you don't know what you're doing, you could easily spend three or four hours in a dungeon.

02:15:35.580 --> 02:15:39.940
and you had all of those that well yeah the water one especially but because of

02:15:39.940 --> 02:15:43.620
that freaking tricky little I can see that a little bit because I get really

02:15:43.620 --> 02:15:49.140
aggravated by those fucking by those fucking caves and PSO my god you spend

02:15:49.140 --> 02:15:53.420
like five hours in those freaking caves it's like chains of scenery please Oh

02:15:53.420 --> 02:15:57.420
fantasy star online yeah yeah I don't know all right so let's wrap up this

02:15:57.420 --> 02:16:00.220
because we kind of did this for a long time this is interesting this is

02:16:00.220 --> 02:16:05.500
interesting yes any yeah sure those of you us that were here for all 100

02:16:05.500 --> 02:16:10.860
games want to say anything they think was left off should have been on there

02:16:12.460 --> 02:16:21.180
bionic commando yes blaster master no mention of the Megaman series at all the

02:16:21.180 --> 02:16:26.340
top 100 retarded what is that that's my only beef no Megaman's anywhere in the

02:16:26.340 --> 02:16:29.940
top what is up with that I treasure was not on the list

02:16:29.940 --> 02:16:34.180
chrono trigger being so low is another one of my bitches yeah that's sad um

02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:36.180
Um, was Boinus Bomb on there?

02:16:36.180 --> 02:16:36.680
No.

02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:37.180
What?

02:16:37.180 --> 02:16:38.180
Kill them now.

02:16:38.180 --> 02:16:40.180
What about...

02:16:40.180 --> 02:16:43.180
And we could ragdrock online, why was that not on there?

02:16:43.180 --> 02:16:44.180
Dance X Revolution was 40.

02:16:44.180 --> 02:16:46.180
Really? Wow.

02:16:46.180 --> 02:16:48.180
Dance X Revolution was higher than Chrono Trigger.

02:16:48.180 --> 02:16:53.180
That's, that is, that's a travesty. I'm never gonna watch G4.

02:16:53.180 --> 02:16:54.180
I'm gonna bomb them.

02:16:54.180 --> 02:16:58.180
Fantasy Star was on the list, actually. Somebody's pitching about Fantasy Star.

02:16:58.180 --> 02:17:03.180
Fantasy Star was, uh, I might have skipped over it. It was in the beginning. Sorry kids, it was 76.

02:17:03.180 --> 02:17:06.680
What the hell kind of crack addict loser printed up that list?

02:17:06.680 --> 02:17:09.680
They put Chrono Trigger underneath the money?

02:17:09.680 --> 02:17:13.180
G4 TV and Entertainment Weekly, you can address those cards.

02:17:13.180 --> 02:17:15.680
Yeah, you people from those companies, you're losers.

02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:18.680
You don't know what the hell you're talking about and you should try playing video games.

02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:20.680
I know, hold on, Entertainment Weekly?

02:17:20.680 --> 02:17:24.180
They don't even know what a video game is, so why are they doing a list like this?

02:17:24.180 --> 02:17:25.680
Why they partner with G4?

02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:29.680
But G4 doesn't even know what a video game is, apparently, you know?

02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:32.680
The whole entire Puyo Puyo series.

02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:36.520
I mean, I just didn't play Tetris on there, but Pio Pio played so differently.

02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:43.800
I mean, I played, you know, Kirby's Avalanche, and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.

02:17:43.800 --> 02:17:46.080
And where was Sonic Adventure?

02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:47.080
Not there.

02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:48.080
That was so different.

02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:49.080
Sonic was lower than it should have been.

02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:50.960
A very, very good mention.

02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:54.640
Multiple people in the chat room were saying this, Earthbound.

02:17:54.640 --> 02:17:55.640
Yeah.

02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:57.800
It should have been a mention.

02:17:57.800 --> 02:18:00.440
I can see why it would not be in the top 50 even.

02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:01.880
Because nobody knows about it.

02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:06.280
I disagree, it's one of the hugest cult video games out there.

02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:09.240
But it's a cult video game.

02:18:09.240 --> 02:18:13.880
We're obviously going for games that people know about, and I never even heard about Earthbound until I met you.

02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:19.880
I think the fact that it's one of the biggest cult games of all time ought to put it on there.

02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:24.640
And people will know Earthbound soon because it's coming out on Game Boy Advance.

02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:26.000
Mother?

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:27.240
Alright.

02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:29.000
huh

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:33.080

02:18:35.460 --> 02:18:36.880

smash brothers within on their no wasn't

02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:40.920

02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:43.720
going like to get my game is not on the list

02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:44.880

let's let's get bank and run over g_-four we're gonna give you guys some

02:18:48.100 --> 02:18:51.040
time to uh... form and get fifty

02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:55.520
over the top one hundred one one

02:18:55.520 --> 02:18:57.820
Do you want to hear my opinion about what game should have been number one?

02:18:57.820 --> 02:18:59.520
No you don't, but I'm going to say anyway.

02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:00.020
What?

02:19:00.020 --> 02:19:02.020
civilian night of course.

02:19:02.020 --> 02:19:02.520
Alright.

02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:04.520
The Japanese version with the better voice typing.

02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:06.520
The Saturn version.

02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:09.520
We're running a little low on time so I'm going to kick us over to break.

02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:10.020
Okay.

02:19:10.020 --> 02:19:13.520
So we've done 7th style music, 8th style music, and 9th style music.

02:19:13.520 --> 02:19:15.520
So let's do some 6th style music.

02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:17.020
Did we ever announce the cage match winner?

02:19:17.020 --> 02:19:18.020
No we didn't.

02:19:18.020 --> 02:19:19.520
You want to announce the cage match winner?

02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:21.020
Fucking Matt.

02:19:21.020 --> 02:19:23.520
Yeah, it's Mona Lisa overdrive again. Hooray.

02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:27.520
Yeah, but you can't win again.

02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:32.520
First time a song has been in for four weeks.

02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:35.520
By the way, another landslide vote for that one.

02:19:35.520 --> 02:19:40.520
So, good job for Mona Lisa Overdrive.

02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:43.520
Alright, so Mona Lisa Overdrive wins.

02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:45.520
Okay, so we're going to do some six-style songs.

02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:52.520
And when we come back, Jamie, is there a six-style song you want to hear?

02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:54.020
So we're out of my mind, right?

02:19:54.020 --> 02:19:54.520
Sure.

02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:55.020
OK.

02:19:55.020 --> 02:19:55.600
It's depressing.

02:19:55.600 --> 02:19:56.280
It's goth.

02:19:56.280 --> 02:19:58.960
And we're just going to do two six style songs.

02:19:58.960 --> 02:20:02.400
We need to come back and do the FUs of the week because we

02:20:02.400 --> 02:20:03.360
haven't done those yet.

02:20:03.360 --> 02:20:04.120
Surprise, surprise.

02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:07.000
So hurry up and send those to me over private message in

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:07.440
the chat room.

02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:08.200
My name is Sky.

02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:09.480
We've got to keep it short this week.

02:20:09.480 --> 02:20:12.840
Please keep your FUs of the week short, chat room.

02:20:12.840 --> 02:20:14.840
All right, we'll be back in a little bit.

02:22:12.840 --> 02:22:41.840
Come walk inside of me, trapped in a ocean

02:22:41.840 --> 02:22:45.840
Where am I going to?

02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:52.840
I need to leave, I need to let go

02:22:52.840 --> 02:23:00.840
Of all the friends and thoughts inside my mind

02:23:00.840 --> 02:23:04.840
From all the changes I've

02:23:04.840 --> 02:23:10.840
How could I find my way to you?

02:23:10.840 --> 02:23:13.840
So give me a chance to know

02:23:13.840 --> 02:23:19.840
I've seen you reaching for my hand

02:23:19.840 --> 02:23:25.840
Follow the leading secrets of my heart

02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:34.840
Oh, it's me, DJ, everywhere on my mind

02:23:34.840 --> 02:23:38.840
Now I'm the giant

02:23:38.840 --> 02:23:57.840
How could I find my way to you?

02:23:57.840 --> 02:24:01.280
You can't remember me

02:24:01.280 --> 02:24:09.040
You can't remember my love

02:24:19.440 --> 02:24:23.360
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:51.360
It's time to start the FUs of the Week!

02:24:53.360 --> 02:25:02.360
Ooh! Every time I listen to this, I still get, like, happy.

02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:09.360
Um, if I could at least go to an idiot driver, she'd nearly run over me.

02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:14.360
Go to the entire parking lot at Arden Fair Mall, because I nearly got hit a bunch of times.

02:25:14.360 --> 02:25:19.360
And then, you know, it also goes toward, you know, just being nervous in general.

02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:23.360
And then it goes toward being exhausted and not being able to sleep.

02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:32.360
And then it goes toward the person on Ragnarok Online who kept casting the ice spell and blocking all the paths and lagging me.

02:25:32.360 --> 02:25:35.360
So, other than that I'm not really all that anxious to you.

02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:38.360
I'm very happy because I'm going to have a new live journal.

02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:39.360
A pretty new live journal layout.

02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:41.360
It is very pretty, I've seen it.

02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:43.360
And it's very transformery.

02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:45.360
And I know another one.

02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:50.360
Another Fuck You goes toward all of those dubbed Headmasters episodes.

02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:56.360
When I'm trying to find Japanese episodes, or, you know, raw ones, or ones that are subtitled,

02:25:56.360 --> 02:26:01.360
instead I'm finding either the crappy three episodes they did in the States, which I already own,

02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:08.360
or, like, those bad dubs that they did. Horrible dubs of Headmasters.

02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:10.360
Jap- It's Transformers.

02:26:11.360 --> 02:26:12.360
Boo.

02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:15.360
So that pisses me off.

02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:20.360
And another one goes toward me not being able to find another hot rod so I can have it at work.

02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:22.360
And that's it.

02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:25.360
Alright.

02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:27.360
Looooookey.

02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:29.360
Okay, um...

02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:31.360
FU2, uh...

02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:34.360
Oh, what was it? Only had two. Oh yeah.

02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:37.360
Um, FU2 is a stupid bitch that sent me my records.

02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:44.360
First off, Culture Club, I'm sorry it doesn't work in two halves. Not at all.

02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:47.360
So, um, you don't know how to pack shit at all.

02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:50.360
So I emailed her back because my records came all broken.

02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:58.360
It's like, oh, I guess I should have done something other than just pat them in bubble wrap and write fragile.

02:26:58.360 --> 02:27:04.360
So I can't get my money back from her, but I'm going to give her one hell of negative feedback on eBay.

02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:11.360
But yeah, that wasted $15, plus the fact that I was overdrawn twice, so my bank charged me $60 for those records.

02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:15.360
So I was at a loss of $75 total for $15 for the record.

02:27:17.360 --> 02:27:22.360
Yeah, at least my Eggy Murphy record works. I had to bend it back.

02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:25.360
Yeah, so that's the one I wanted anyways.

02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:33.360
And then finally, in world news, Fv2's a dumb, I don't know what nationality you are, but Middle Eastern bitch that's bitchy in Florida.

02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:38.080
about the fact that you have to remove your veil to take a driver's license photo.

02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:40.000
Listen bitch, you look like a fucking ninja.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:43.360
You need to like take the damn veil off or just quit driving.

02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:43.920
I better get.

02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:47.840
Why don't you just support your ass over to, you know, the Middle East where you belong.

02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:49.360
So, uh, yeah, I'm sorry.

02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:53.680
I don't, I want to sound like some kind of like fascist or American or something,

02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:57.120
but if you're going to live in our country, you kind of have to follow our rules and laws.

02:27:57.120 --> 02:27:58.000
And that is a law.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:02.800
You have to take your hat off to take a driver's license.

02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:06.800
If you don't, you don't get to drive in the country, and that's, that's the way it is, I'm sorry.

02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:14.800
She looks like frickin', um, what's it, that stupid floating wizard guy from, um, Orko. She looks like Orko, okay?

02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:20.800
I, I, I just have, um, three words, four words, separation of church and state.

02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:24.800
I'm done. That's all I had. I'm not that anxious because of the lyrics.

02:28:24.800 --> 02:28:30.800
I'll fuck you by the lyrics. I don't know what you meant by that, but okay.

02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:35.800
My F.U. of the week goes to my SARS, my never-ending case of SARS, and my brain tumor.

02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:38.800
Fuck you, Irene. My other F.U. goes to Irene.

02:28:39.800 --> 02:28:45.800
And my next F.U. goes to the fact that I had, what, something like five, six drinks, and I was drunk for maybe, like, two minutes.

02:28:46.800 --> 02:28:48.800
At the most. Sucked.

02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:57.800
It may have seemed like two minutes to you, but I remember you and, like, Matt and Irene frickin' jumpin' around, being all silly.

02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:08.800
I was probably more like an hour. Yeah, Irene, like, tripped. She said she tripped, but it looks to me like she just did a Superman fly dive thing towards the emergency exit. It was really interesting.

02:29:09.800 --> 02:29:13.800
Alright, let's move on to other folks in the room, FUs of the Week.

02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:16.800
Uh, Brad?

02:29:17.800 --> 02:29:20.800
FU goes to this segment because I really don't like it.

02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:22.800
Uh, Irene?

02:29:23.800 --> 02:29:24.800
FUs of the Week.

02:29:25.800 --> 02:29:26.800
Brad, come on.

02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:40.800
My FUs two weird toe guys that are like freaking scary that come to help you at like 3 o'clock in the morning and just say yeah doesn't anybody ever sleep in this chair out and fuck you dude.

02:29:40.800 --> 02:29:49.800
That's part of my idea I forgot about. I was driving home after dropping a rob and a madoff at rob's place.

02:29:49.800 --> 02:29:54.800
I was driving around and my tire went flat and my CD half shaft in the front right of my car blew out.

02:29:54.800 --> 02:29:58.800
So that's a couple hundred dollars of work I've got to do on my car.

02:29:58.800 --> 02:30:06.800
Fuck you do automobiles. Shitty ones made in America or Japan or Korea or German or whatever. I don't care.

02:30:06.800 --> 02:30:11.420
Yugoslavia it doesn't matter all cars stuck in some way or another came he has another one play my music

02:30:13.840 --> 02:30:16.920
There okay, I can't hear it, but anyway um

02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:22.240
My allergies fuck them because now my chest hurts

02:30:22.240 --> 02:30:27.960
and I feel like I have SARS and I actually feel sick is the thing I feel sick and

02:30:28.480 --> 02:30:32.800
Like and like fuck it not having access to my PTO until another two months

02:30:32.800 --> 02:30:38.080
because I would so just stay home and like cough up all my lungs and then feel

02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:48.400
better my insurance kicks in today okay that it yeah yeah look at that ice queen

02:30:48.400 --> 02:30:55.840
anything first like you goes to you for not getting my name right bit ever ice

02:30:55.840 --> 02:31:01.280
princess don't be very much come on the ice princess and I'm only an instant

02:31:01.280 --> 02:31:08.040
But when I have alcohol so there and yeah, if I see my allergies to and the fact that Claritin is like freaking $12 for 10 pills

02:31:08.720 --> 02:31:11.840
It works really well, but it's $12 for 10 tablets

02:31:12.520 --> 02:31:17.080
It's overpriced. It works. Well, it's overpriced and it makes me really dehydrated

02:31:18.300 --> 02:31:19.480
Yeah

02:31:19.480 --> 02:31:24.120
But other than that my only fuck you goes to those people who say that you have to have a job to be happy

02:31:24.120 --> 02:31:28.360
Because I don't have a job right now and I'm really really happy. I like it

02:31:28.360 --> 02:31:32.360
Well, yeah, but that's not going to be an issue for much longer.

02:31:32.360 --> 02:31:33.360
I have a pseudo job.

02:31:33.360 --> 02:31:38.360
I can work when I want, however many times I want, doing whatever I want, and it pays

02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:39.360
pretty well, so yeah.

02:31:39.360 --> 02:31:40.360
He's a whore.

02:31:40.360 --> 02:31:41.360
That's right.

02:31:41.360 --> 02:31:42.360
All right.

02:31:42.360 --> 02:31:47.360
Let's move on to the chat room FUs.

02:31:47.360 --> 02:31:51.360
Leadfoot would like to say FU to G4 in their list.

02:31:51.360 --> 02:31:54.360
Me love you long time.

02:31:54.360 --> 02:32:04.360
StaplerX would like to say an FU to not having cash for Ragnarok Online and one for his friend, FU to G4 for that god-awful list.

02:32:04.360 --> 02:32:11.360
ryc3 would like to say FU to G4. I love Mega Man series and it should have been in the top 100.

02:32:11.360 --> 02:32:18.360
FU to all the net splits and the IRC servers happening today.

02:32:18.360 --> 02:32:21.360
Black Lab would like to give these following FUs.

02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:23.360
Fuck the legend, I'm sick of that song.

02:32:23.360 --> 02:32:27.360
Fuck that list for not including marathon or escape velocity.

02:32:27.360 --> 02:32:30.360
Both revolutionary Mac games, oh my god what the fuck.

02:32:33.360 --> 02:32:34.360
Mac doesn't exist.

02:32:34.360 --> 02:32:36.360
Three, fuck finals.

02:32:36.360 --> 02:32:40.360
Four, fuck running out of meal swipes two weeks before the end of the year.

02:32:40.360 --> 02:32:43.360
I have to live off Easy Mac until next Friday.

02:32:45.360 --> 02:32:46.360
What about ramen?

02:32:46.360 --> 02:32:52.040
23rd magus f u having to do 3 term papers over the weekend because the syllabus for

StarTetsuyo would like to say F you to Sky for getting me re-addicted to NES emulators.

02:33:19.520 --> 02:33:21.820
You're welcome.

02:33:21.820 --> 02:33:24.420
Theazhp would like to say F you to...

02:33:24.420 --> 02:33:26.220
StarFox was not on the list.

02:33:26.220 --> 02:33:27.320
It was not. You're correct.

02:33:27.320 --> 02:33:28.320
Damn them. Okay, sorry.

02:33:28.320 --> 02:33:30.020
God, F G4.

02:33:30.020 --> 02:33:38.020
F you to UPS4 losing DCB's PS2 and F you to G4 or whatever for not putting Tetris Attack on the list.

02:33:41.220 --> 02:33:44.420
Yeah, Tetris might have counted Tetris Attack. We'll never know.

02:33:44.420 --> 02:33:49.420
Uh, VX JasonXV would like to say a big F U to bandwidth whores.

02:33:50.420 --> 02:33:51.420
Me too.

02:33:53.420 --> 02:33:55.420
No, you're just a whore in general.

02:33:56.420 --> 02:33:57.420
Irene was talking about you, Ralph.

02:33:57.420 --> 02:33:58.420
Shut up.

02:33:58.420 --> 02:34:06.420
Angel would like to give an F U to obnoxious, egotistical, seniority-slinging co-workers who get paid for nothing else than to boss people around and make them feel like shit.

02:34:06.420 --> 02:34:08.420
Yeah, management.

02:34:08.420 --> 02:34:10.420
There's not question mark on the typo, oops.

02:34:10.420 --> 02:34:13.420
Quick your job, it feels really, really, really good. I promise.

02:34:13.420 --> 02:34:14.420
Now you're out of money.

02:34:15.420 --> 02:34:23.420
Justin would like to say F you to myself because I got into Ragnarok just as the servers came back, but I DC'd and tried to reconnect and it didn't let me.

02:34:23.420 --> 02:34:27.420
Oh well, I will have it by Wednesday. I will be there soon, Jamie.

02:34:27.420 --> 02:34:31.420
And Skye, play this song. The window. People need to be scared. I have no time.

02:34:31.420 --> 02:34:35.420
Also, F you to me puking nine times on Wednesday. F you to my sickness.

02:34:35.420 --> 02:34:37.420
You have SARS. Haha.

02:34:37.420 --> 02:34:44.420
That's it for the FUs! Yay!

02:34:44.420 --> 02:35:05.420
Once again, and you only have three hours left, you will go instantly, right now, not waiting one second, and go vote for The Legend of Trance on BomaniStyle, and you will vote a ten, and you will like it. That is all.

02:35:05.420 --> 02:35:12.420
And that would be the remix contest. Yes, you want them to vote The Legend of Trance and Dark Black Forest, both tens.

02:35:12.420 --> 02:35:14.420
That is correct.

02:35:14.420 --> 02:35:17.420
Where are you?

02:35:17.420 --> 02:35:19.420
Yeah, what are you ranked right now?

02:35:19.420 --> 02:35:21.420
I think I'm like fifth.

02:35:21.420 --> 02:35:23.420
Unacceptable!

02:35:23.420 --> 02:35:28.420
I still get a CD.

02:35:28.420 --> 02:35:34.540
Also other things that you can do you can vote our station of five in your life 365 player window because we love the ratings

02:35:34.540 --> 02:35:36.540
and you can also

02:35:36.940 --> 02:35:39.500
Whore out our listening hours by listening to us all day long

02:35:43.740 --> 02:35:48.220
Okay, all right, so let's do the orange crush thingy, all right, we're gonna do orange crush

02:35:48.220 --> 02:35:54.500
Hey, let me go first so I can go the bathroom. Are you ready for orange crush? Irene? Okay, here we go. I'm very ready

02:35:54.500 --> 02:36:04.500
Now, it's time for Orange Crush. It's time to ask questions during Orange Crush. Yay!

02:36:04.500 --> 02:36:11.760
I love the theme song. It's cool. Okay. Everyone's leaving. Everyone's leaving. I don't want

02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:16.900
to do Orange Crush. It sucks. Wait, where's? Hello? We need contestants. Yeah, he's back,

02:36:16.900 --> 02:36:23.260
he's back. Okay, here it is. Okay, so the theme of this one is foreplay. And these are

02:36:23.260 --> 02:36:24.260
Irene's favorite.

02:36:24.260 --> 02:36:27.260
Yeah, these are questions about Osamu Kubota.

02:36:27.260 --> 02:36:28.260
Alright.

02:36:28.260 --> 02:36:30.260
Yeah, and then Matt's like, oh fuck, I'm screwed.

02:36:30.260 --> 02:36:31.260
But um, okay.

02:36:31.260 --> 02:36:33.260
So, does anyone have a timer for 30 seconds?

02:36:33.260 --> 02:36:34.260
I do.

02:36:34.260 --> 02:36:35.260
I'll time it.

02:36:35.260 --> 02:36:36.260
Okay, super.

02:36:36.260 --> 02:36:37.260
Here we go.

02:36:37.260 --> 02:36:38.260
Okay, so we'll, huh?

02:36:38.260 --> 02:36:39.260
Yeah, turn it down.

02:36:39.260 --> 02:36:40.260
Yeah.

02:36:40.260 --> 02:36:41.260
Oh, here, I'll turn it down.

02:36:41.260 --> 02:36:42.260
Yeah.

02:36:42.260 --> 02:36:43.260
Turn it down.

02:36:43.260 --> 02:36:44.260
Okay, so.

02:36:44.260 --> 02:36:45.260
No, you're fine.

02:36:45.260 --> 02:36:46.260
We're fine.

02:36:46.260 --> 02:36:47.260
I just turned out the in-studio sound completely.

02:36:47.260 --> 02:36:48.260
Okay.

02:36:48.260 --> 02:36:49.260
Okay.

02:36:49.260 --> 02:36:50.260
Here, I'll give a mic to Matt.

02:36:50.260 --> 02:36:51.260
Here we go.

02:36:51.260 --> 02:36:52.260
Okay, in three, two, one.

02:36:52.260 --> 02:37:06.420
ready? What year was Osamu Kaboda born? I don't care. What's his blood type? A positive.

02:37:06.420 --> 02:37:22.180
What taxon was Osamu Kaboda consulted on? What are his two main hobbies? Playing games

02:37:22.180 --> 02:37:32.080
and I'm killing people I don't know okay oh you got none up okay yeah that's

02:37:32.080 --> 02:37:37.320
right okay all right so how many did how many did Matt get yeah none of them

02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:42.480
right Oh Matt got none of them right okay so yeah then we're ready we're

02:37:42.480 --> 02:37:47.920
ready to bring in Jamie yeah but she's going potty right now I think that's a

02:37:47.920 --> 02:38:08.240
Let's do some more Orange Crush, it's time to crush the Orange Crush, we're in an intermission

02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:15.200
Let me ask, do people like Orange Crush?

02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:17.720
Is this going to be a regular segment?

02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:20.000
Are the people in the chat room digging it?

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:23.360
Because I've got a lot of material.

02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:24.840
I think they like it.

02:38:24.840 --> 02:38:25.840
They like you, Irene.

02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:26.840
They really like you.

02:38:26.840 --> 02:38:27.840
Aww.

02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:28.840
Thanks.

02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:29.840
You love me.

02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:30.840
You really love me.

02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:31.840
Can I hand the mic over to Brad?

02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:32.840
Okay, hold on.

02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:37.120
He has an idea and I'm scared.

02:38:37.120 --> 02:38:41.960
It looks like with the nature of these questions and stuff, and obviously the lack of knowledge

02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:46.520
that our contestants have on these questions, we might should be able to change the length

02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:51.280
of the time, or whatever, to 45 seconds, because, eh.

02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:52.280
But not now.

02:38:52.280 --> 02:38:53.280
That's a good suggestion for the future.

02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:54.280
Not now.

02:38:54.280 --> 02:38:55.280
Yeah.

02:38:55.280 --> 02:38:58.920
That's production notes, but I'm allowed to give that out since we're sitting here waiting

02:38:58.920 --> 02:38:59.920
forever.

02:38:59.920 --> 02:39:00.920
Yeah.

02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:03.640
And you know, what else am I thinking in regards to Orange Crash?

02:39:03.640 --> 02:39:06.360
I want to do Orange Jeopardy one week on the show.

02:39:06.360 --> 02:39:10.680
If you thought that G4 thing took forever on the show, I want to do Orange Jeopardy.

02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:12.800
Can I give a hint about another Orange Crush?

02:39:12.800 --> 02:39:17.280
Another thing I don't like about it, it's like you're giving specific categories about

02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:20.640
like certain people and stuff that have no friggin' clue about what the hell's going

02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:21.640
on.

02:39:21.640 --> 02:39:22.640
It needs to be multiple-

02:39:22.640 --> 02:39:23.640
Hold on, hold on.

02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:24.640
Multiple choice?

02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:27.760
No, it needs to either be multiple choice or it needs to be like something else.

02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:28.760
That's a good idea.

02:39:28.760 --> 02:39:30.240
Maybe we should try multiple choice sometime.

02:39:30.240 --> 02:39:31.240
Because I don't-

02:39:31.240 --> 02:39:32.240
But the reason why-

02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:33.240
I don't know nor care.

02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:34.280
Here's the thing, Matt, Matt.

02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:38.440
We understand that people aren't going to know a lot of the answers to these questions.

02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:40.880
That's kind of why we're doing it, because it's kind of like a knowledge thing.

02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:45.240
We're teaching people out there who might want to watch.

02:39:45.240 --> 02:39:49.920
Some people are fanatics about some of the artists, and so they like to know, and they

02:39:49.920 --> 02:39:52.400
like to hear these things, like birth dates of the artists.

02:39:52.400 --> 02:39:53.400
I think.

02:39:53.400 --> 02:39:54.400
Okay, time to go.

02:39:54.400 --> 02:39:55.400
All right, here we go.

02:39:55.400 --> 02:39:58.000
Are you going to fill Jamie in on what tonight?

02:39:58.000 --> 02:39:59.000
Oh, hi.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
Fill me what?

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:02.000
Fill Jamie up.

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:03.000
Okay.

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:09.580
Okay, the theme of tonight, Jamie, is called foreplay, and these are questions about Osama

02:40:09.580 --> 02:40:15.320
Koboda. Whichever his website. You did? Then you should know. I'll probably get them wrong

02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:20.960
because I don't remember. It's okay. So do you have the time set? Yes. Okay. Three, two,

02:40:20.960 --> 02:40:27.960
one, go. What year was he born? Seventy-four. What's his blood type? A. Okay. What tax song

02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:39.600
type? A. What tax song was Osamu Kaboda consulted on? Era. What's his two main hobbies? French

02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:46.360
and music. What is the name of his production house? I don't remember. Ok, that's all of

02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:55.480
them. Kaboda productions? No, both of you got none of them right. Ok, yeah. He was back

02:40:55.480 --> 02:41:03.200
1965. Okay. Yeah. He was born in 1965. I'll relay. I'll relay. You ask the questions.

02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:08.680
I'll relay the answers. Okay. What's his blood type? I'm going to say O. No, it's A.B.

02:41:08.680 --> 02:41:16.560
I almost said A.B. Yeah. You were close. Okay. But it's A.B. Yeah. Okay. What tack song was

02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:22.280
Osamu Okubota consulted on? I know this one. Still My Words. Yeah. He did the piano part

02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:28.000
for still my words. What are his two main hobbies? Cooking and traveling, right? That's

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:37.000
correct. What is the name of his... Here's Men and Women, Matt. That's his two hobbies.

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:42.120
Maybe. I mean, if you take a look at him, he's kind of a mixture of the two. Yeah, okay.

02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:45.960
And what is the name of his production house? This is really interesting. This is very interesting,

02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:48.960
Hey guys, listen. Rob?

02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:49.960
Okay.

02:41:49.960 --> 02:41:51.960
What is the name of his production house?

02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:52.960
Good Cool.

02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:54.960
Yeah, that's the name of his production house.

02:41:54.960 --> 02:41:55.960
Now, think about that for a second.

02:41:55.960 --> 02:41:57.960
Now we know who Good Cool is.

02:41:57.960 --> 02:42:00.960
Well, maybe. It's kind of interesting to me.

02:42:00.960 --> 02:42:05.960
And I've heard rumors something about Tack having something to do with Good Cool.

02:42:05.960 --> 02:42:08.960
Yeah, well they're really good friends.

02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:12.960
But I mean, if you think about it, I can kind of see some similarities to the style of music.

02:42:12.960 --> 02:42:16.160
I mean, it's a different style of music that Good Cool puts out, but the sounds...

02:42:16.160 --> 02:42:17.160
Yeah.

02:42:17.160 --> 02:42:19.680
Uh, Selma and Kubota performed era with Tack?

02:42:19.680 --> 02:42:20.680
Oh.

02:42:20.680 --> 02:42:21.680
That's right.

02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:25.760
Jamie played, like, I remember, it was way, oh my god, it was many episodes ago, but you

02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:26.760
brought...

02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:27.760
Tack and Kubota Live.

02:42:27.760 --> 02:42:28.760
Yeah, it was Tack and Kubota Live.

02:42:28.760 --> 02:42:29.760
Hm.

02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:30.760
That's cool.

02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:31.760
That's cool.

02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:32.760
Yeah.

02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:33.760
Anyway.

02:42:33.760 --> 02:42:34.760
But yeah, so, yeah.

02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:35.760
There you go.

02:42:35.760 --> 02:42:39.800
I was gonna ask how tall he was, but that's kind of a boring question, but he's 5'8".

02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:40.800
He's Japanese, let me short.

02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:41.800
I'm almost the same.

02:42:41.800 --> 02:42:46.360
more interesting than the blood type question but you know well okay what's

02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:51.120
that yeah he is fluent in French and English yeah but the blood typing is

02:42:51.120 --> 02:42:57.480
that's a common thing like a Japanese thing Japanese really care about I know

02:42:57.480 --> 02:43:01.840
I know so that's an interesting fact I mean that's something that is not going

02:43:01.840 --> 02:43:05.040
to be on everyone else's yeah when you go to Japan you don't ask girls what

02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:08.200
you're with your sign you say what's your blood type oh and who signs Gemini

02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:10.200
because he was born in June. Yeah, anyway.

02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:12.200
Mmm, tasty.

02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:16.200
That's it with your blood type. Mmm, tasty.

02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:21.200
Well you know, I was born in June and I'm a cancer.

02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:23.200
Yeah, well you are a cancer.

02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:25.200
I'm a cancer on society.

02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:31.200
Yes, exactly. So that concludes another episode of Orange Crush.

02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:35.200
This is the end of Orange Crush.

02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:38.600
We need to like make a real song for it or something.

02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:39.600
One of these days.

02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:40.600
One of these days.

02:43:40.600 --> 02:43:41.600
I love your version, Rob.

02:43:41.600 --> 02:43:42.600
Thank you.

02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:43.600
Thank you.

02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:44.600
I appreciate that.

02:43:44.600 --> 02:43:45.600
You're welcome.

02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:46.600
So now we have a little time to kill.

02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:47.920
Shit, we could have done listless.

02:43:47.920 --> 02:43:49.600
Actually, no, because we would have had to rush through it.

02:43:49.600 --> 02:43:52.600
So we're kind of stuck with a little bit of time here.

02:43:52.600 --> 02:43:53.600
We're stuck with Rob.

02:43:53.600 --> 02:43:55.800
Can you talk about something we talked about?

02:43:55.800 --> 02:44:02.640
I can talk about something about that list of, or we were talking about what game people

02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:04.760
would like to see a sequel to, a Final Fantasy game.

02:44:04.760 --> 02:44:07.760
I was thinking about this while I was having a cigarette.

02:44:07.760 --> 02:44:12.160
Matt says Final Fantasy 3, I'm going to go around and see who thinks

02:44:12.160 --> 02:44:13.720
what should be done.

02:44:13.720 --> 02:44:18.400
So Rob, what Final Fantasy, and this could be any game with the name Final Fantasy in it,

02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:23.240
do you think should be a sequel, have a sequel done?

02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:26.560
I'm tempted to say 8, so they can do it right.

02:44:26.560 --> 02:44:29.160
Lookin' good, fuck you.

02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:31.480
Uh, but honestly, 4.

02:44:31.480 --> 02:44:33.680
If any of them. You geek.

02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:37.180
I think that's a great choice, because 4 had a really interesting story.

02:44:37.180 --> 02:44:38.180
2 in America, yes, for those who...

02:44:38.180 --> 02:44:39.880
4 was depressing.

02:44:39.880 --> 02:44:43.180
Yeah, it was pretty depressing, but...

02:44:43.180 --> 02:44:45.680
Rydia 2003, motherfuckers.

02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:50.180
It's like, what else could go wrong in my life?

02:44:50.180 --> 02:44:53.180
Final Fantasy VI, you don't want to know what happened to Terra.

02:44:53.180 --> 02:44:55.180
Because she's like my bitch.

02:44:55.180 --> 02:45:01.180
They need to do a sequel to Final Fantasy VI, they can explain the goddamn ending.

02:45:01.180 --> 02:45:11.180
Yeah, because it alludes to the fact that when the statues are destroyed that Terra might disappear, but she might not. It doesn't freaking give you any clue as to what actually happens to her.

02:45:11.180 --> 02:45:16.180
Sorry for the lack of spoiler warning, but if you haven't beaten it by now, we figure you're probably not going to.

02:45:16.180 --> 02:45:17.180
I know.

02:45:17.180 --> 02:45:25.180
It doesn't matter if spoilers are given, because that game is excellent and you should play it no matter what. I mean, as far as RPG games is concerned, you have to play that game.

02:45:25.180 --> 02:45:27.180
Yeah, it doesn't really spoil anything.

02:45:27.180 --> 02:45:30.760
That game is so good. I've had it since it came out and I have played it like a million times

02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:35.180
In fact, just like a couple of weeks ago. I started playing it again. So yeah, that game is like so awesome

02:45:36.080 --> 02:45:38.880
Yeah, three or six whatever, you know

02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:46.400
Eight

02:45:47.480 --> 02:45:49.680
They should make eight because I

02:45:50.280 --> 02:45:54.440
Don't know they were talking about making nine. That's just be a sequel to eight where they're gonna have

02:45:54.440 --> 02:46:00.200
it was going to follow around the party of uh, wasn't it the same like Lagunas or something

02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:01.200
like that?

02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:02.200
Oh, uh, Laguna?

02:46:02.200 --> 02:46:03.200
Laguna, yeah.

02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:09.520
No spoils because we have somebody in the room that hasn't seen the end of 8, I'm talking

02:46:09.520 --> 02:46:10.520
about Irene here, so.

02:46:10.520 --> 02:46:14.360
Well, it doesn't have any, I'm just saying they were supposed to follow around Laguna.

02:46:14.360 --> 02:46:16.900
Are you talking about 9 before it was made?

02:46:16.900 --> 02:46:17.900
They were going to?

02:46:17.900 --> 02:46:20.800
Yeah, they were talking about like, it was going to be done in the point of view of Laguna.

02:46:20.800 --> 02:46:21.800
Oh, weird.

02:46:21.800 --> 02:46:41.800
I have an interesting rumor that went around when it was being produced, the first bit of information was given out about eight, it was just two pictures, three pictures, I'm sorry, the logo, a picture of Laguna and a picture of Squall, two male characters, and people were looking at the logo thinking that it was Laguna and Squall hugging, and then they said the theme of the story was going to be loved.

02:46:41.800 --> 02:46:45.840
So the rumor about Final Fantasy VIII was that they were going to be gay, it was going

02:46:45.840 --> 02:46:49.840
to be a gay love story, and everybody freaked out because of all the homophobes.

02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:53.040
And I was like, that would be so funny and interesting if they could do a gay story and

02:46:53.040 --> 02:46:54.040
do it good, you know?

02:46:54.040 --> 02:46:55.040
I don't know.

02:46:55.040 --> 02:46:56.040
Oh, hold on.

02:46:56.040 --> 02:46:57.040
Rice Princess has something to say.

02:46:57.040 --> 02:47:01.700
Do you have an interesting rumor?

02:47:01.700 --> 02:47:03.480
I heard Rinoa had crabs.

02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:07.440
She probably does, it frickin'...

02:47:07.440 --> 02:47:09.360
Anyway, um

02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:12.400
Does Jamie have an opinion about? Oh hold on Rob's going next one

02:47:12.840 --> 02:47:15.440
No, I just wanted to say if they did do that for Final Fantasy 8

02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:18.560
It would be the best video game of all time number one on G for the list, baby

02:47:24.200 --> 02:47:30.900
More it was much more squall because squirrels pretty and I want like Irvine selfie, you know

02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:36.320
Cool he has a gun I

02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:46.320
I agree with Jamie wholeheartedly, and you know what, I've said many times before, and I'm going to say it again, the movie should have been 8, 8 should have been the movie.

02:47:46.320 --> 02:47:51.320
And what he means by that is 8, the story in 8 should have been the actual movie.

02:47:51.320 --> 02:47:56.320
The story of Final Fantasy the movie shouldn't have had anything to do with Final Fantasy at all.

02:47:56.320 --> 02:47:59.320
Yeah, so, anywho, kind of like Mystic Quest. Anyway.

02:47:59.320 --> 02:48:02.320
Mystic Quest was like Final Fantasy for babies.

02:48:02.320 --> 02:48:03.320
Yeah, kind of.

02:48:03.320 --> 02:48:04.320
For babies with SARS.

02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:09.320
I'll tell you what Mystic Quest is. In Japan, it's called Final Fantasy USA. Thank you.

02:48:09.320 --> 02:48:10.320
Yep.

02:48:10.320 --> 02:48:12.320
Super Mario USA!

02:48:12.320 --> 02:48:16.320
Do you know what the Final Fantasy VII in America was considered over there?

02:48:16.320 --> 02:48:18.320
Final Fantasy VII International.

02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:21.320
I'm playing Final Fantasy X International.

02:48:21.320 --> 02:48:28.320
Which is like, basically it's as easy as Final Fantasy X, the Japanese version, but in English.

02:48:28.320 --> 02:48:30.320
And it has a few extra features I heard.

02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:31.320
Not really.

02:48:31.320 --> 02:48:32.320
the actual DVD.

02:48:32.320 --> 02:48:35.180
You can see the difficulty of your spirit grid and that's about it.

02:48:35.180 --> 02:48:36.180
The DVD, the extra DVD.

02:48:36.180 --> 02:48:38.000
Mine didn't come with DVD.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:41.240
They were supposed to release a separate DVD when you, maybe it was if you pre-ordered

02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:42.240
it.

02:48:42.240 --> 02:48:43.240
That's fine, I've already got it subtitled.

02:48:43.240 --> 02:48:45.840
It was, it was a, um, like an extra spin.

02:48:45.840 --> 02:48:49.800
It's you know running around being retarded, seriously.

02:48:49.800 --> 02:48:50.800
I haven't seen it yet, so.

02:48:50.800 --> 02:48:54.200
I'll show it to you, I'll copy it for you, but I have it subtitled if anyone on their

02:48:54.200 --> 02:48:55.200
chat room or...

02:48:55.200 --> 02:48:57.640
Hold on, what's that have to say?

02:48:57.640 --> 02:49:02.640
Okay, now I watched the show preview video for Final Fantasy X2 on G4.

02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:03.640
No spoilers?

02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:04.640
Oh, this isn't a spoiler.

02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:05.640
Okay, go ahead.

02:49:05.640 --> 02:49:07.640
In fact, it makes no sense.

02:49:07.640 --> 02:49:10.640
The whole video, all it is, is Riona.

02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:11.640
Riona?

02:49:11.640 --> 02:49:12.640
Or, not Riona.

02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:13.640
Yuna?

02:49:13.640 --> 02:49:14.640
The maker?

02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:15.640
Whatever, Yuna.

02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:16.640
Some Japanese.

02:49:16.640 --> 02:49:17.640
Yuna Cross?

02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:18.640
Yeah, yeah.

02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:19.640
Yuna doing karaoke.

02:49:19.640 --> 02:49:20.640
Singing.

02:49:20.640 --> 02:49:21.640
Just singing.

02:49:21.640 --> 02:49:22.640
Like some pop idol.

02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:24.640
I'm like, I was watching it.

02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:25.640
No, she's singing like a pop idol.

02:49:25.640 --> 02:49:29.640
I'm watching and going, are they going to show anything else?

02:49:29.640 --> 02:49:30.640
No.

02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:31.640
Okay.

02:49:31.640 --> 02:49:32.640
Well, this is interesting.

02:49:32.640 --> 02:49:39.800
Did anybody see the, what was it, the Star Wars, I think it was a Lucasfilm, the little

02:49:39.800 --> 02:49:46.120
Lucasarts computer game intro thing where all the stormtroopers were doing like a dance

02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:47.120
or whatever.

02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:48.120
No.

02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:49.120
I mean, what does that have to do with it?

02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:50.120
But it was funny.

02:49:50.120 --> 02:49:51.120
So it's a way to promote the game.

02:49:51.120 --> 02:49:52.840
Yeah, but it's heard just singing.

02:49:52.840 --> 02:49:55.620
It showed nothing of the game.

02:49:55.620 --> 02:49:58.920
You're supposed to be previewing the game to show me, to get me interested in playing the game.

02:49:58.920 --> 02:50:01.620
All I saw was singing, like, the main theme.

02:50:01.620 --> 02:50:05.120
Have you seen the Metal Gear Solid 2 commercial in Japan with G.A.C.T. in it?

02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:05.620
No.

02:50:05.620 --> 02:50:07.620
Has nothing to do with it, but it's G.A.C.T. and so people are going to be like,

02:50:07.620 --> 02:50:09.620
No, this is in our chat room.

02:50:09.620 --> 02:50:12.620
It's, we're making fun of the Final Fantasy and other stories.

02:50:12.620 --> 02:50:16.620
And, um, Mario's saying, uh, Yuna's going,

02:50:16.620 --> 02:50:19.120
Waka, your stomach is fat, lolololol.

02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:20.620
And he's like, shut the fuck up.

02:50:20.620 --> 02:50:25.620
Okay... Randomness... dot dot dot com.

02:50:25.620 --> 02:50:28.620
Um, anything else to add, Matt?

02:50:28.620 --> 02:50:32.620
Um, yeah, looks okay, I guess.

02:50:32.620 --> 02:50:36.620
But are they supposed to be doing two sequels, or one sequel to Final Fantasy X?

02:50:36.620 --> 02:50:40.620
I heard a rumor there was going to be a third game in the series.

02:50:40.620 --> 02:50:42.620
But, I don't know, just like...

02:50:42.620 --> 02:50:44.620
But that's a rumor! Don't take my word for it.

02:50:44.620 --> 02:50:46.620
Depends on how X2 ends.

02:50:46.620 --> 02:50:49.620
Matt says, depends on how X2 ends.

02:50:49.620 --> 02:50:53.620
Don't take my word for it.

02:50:53.620 --> 02:50:54.620
Get the book.

02:50:54.620 --> 02:50:58.620
I haven't given my idea my opinion.

02:50:58.620 --> 02:51:04.620
This is where I came up with the idea of asking everybody is because I was out there and I was thinking, what about other games in the Final Fantasy series?

02:51:04.620 --> 02:51:07.620
I think they should do a sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics.

02:51:07.620 --> 02:51:10.620
Anybody who's played Final Fantasy Tactics would go, what the fuck?

02:51:10.620 --> 02:51:12.620
You play the game ten times through.

02:51:12.620 --> 02:51:15.620
The story is so convoluted that you're just like, huh?

02:51:15.620 --> 02:51:16.120
Huh?

02:51:16.120 --> 02:51:19.620
Kind of like Mission Impossible 1, but worse.

02:51:19.620 --> 02:51:25.620
And, I mean, the game was, the game was, no, there was a, there was a, Matt says there was no story.

02:51:25.620 --> 02:51:30.620
There was a huge, great, deep story, but you have to play the game so many times.

02:51:30.620 --> 02:51:35.620
And I think it was, to figure out, and I think it had to do with translation, because there was kind of a poor translation.

02:51:35.620 --> 02:51:40.620
But I think if they made a sequel that kind of tied in with the original story, they can kind of explain the original story a little better.

02:51:40.620 --> 02:51:41.620
And it was a good game.

02:51:41.620 --> 02:51:43.620
I think they could make another good game.

02:51:43.620 --> 02:51:51.620
Instead they're doing Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, ooh, where you're the stupid kid who gets sucked into the Final Fantasy Tactics world, ooh.

02:51:51.620 --> 02:51:53.620
What?

02:51:53.620 --> 02:51:55.620
You're a little kid that gets sucked into the-

02:51:55.620 --> 02:52:01.620
Yes, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is about a kid in the present day, and he gets sucked into the world of Final Fantasy Tactics.

02:52:01.620 --> 02:52:03.620
So there's cars and stuff at the beginning.

02:52:03.620 --> 02:52:05.620
Kids getting sucked.

02:52:05.620 --> 02:52:07.620
Yeah, does that turn you on, you little pedophile?

02:52:07.620 --> 02:52:09.620
No.

02:52:09.620 --> 02:52:14.620
That would be cool to do a Final Fantasy Tactics but in like the Final Fantasy VII world.

02:52:14.620 --> 02:52:19.620
Well, Cloud showed up in Final Fantasy Tactics and so there was some...

02:52:19.620 --> 02:52:20.620
No, not gay.

02:52:20.620 --> 02:52:25.620
Cloud was one of the strongest characters if you level him up correctly and things like that.

02:52:25.620 --> 02:52:29.620
I mean he could do omni-slash and all these other cool attacks and stuff.

02:52:29.620 --> 02:52:31.620
You know what I'm thinking about?

02:52:31.620 --> 02:52:33.620
I'm thinking about this whole gay Final Fantasy thing.

02:52:33.620 --> 02:52:37.620
And so I'm like, yeah, they should do like a sequel to Final Fantasy VII and have like the Cloud...

02:52:37.620 --> 02:52:39.620
I'm going to give you some of my Gujinshi scan.

02:53:07.620 --> 02:53:11.500
What about the scene where, like, Cloud has his shirt off and he's, you know, walkin'...

02:53:11.500 --> 02:53:12.500
Never mind.

02:53:15.500 --> 02:53:17.500
I wouldn't say that on the radio.

02:53:18.500 --> 02:53:22.500
I know, I know, I'm just saying what Rice Princess just said, I would not say on the radio.

02:53:22.500 --> 02:53:24.500
No, Matt, don't say it.

02:53:24.500 --> 02:53:25.500
No.

02:53:29.500 --> 02:53:30.500
Anyway...

02:53:30.500 --> 02:53:31.500
No!

02:53:31.500 --> 02:53:32.500
God, Matt!

02:53:32.500 --> 02:53:33.500
Stop it!

02:53:33.500 --> 02:53:37.500
Okay, Rice Princess is trying to say a bunch of, like, spoilers about Seven.

02:53:37.500 --> 02:53:43.000
I know that everybody should have already played Final Fantasy 7, but I think there are people that might not have.

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:46.000
I'm not giving the microphone to Matt, he's gonna ruin something.

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
What? The fact that...

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
I just want the microphone!

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:51.000
Give me the mic.

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
Oh, by the way, Aeris dies.

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:54.500
Just so you know.

02:53:54.500 --> 02:53:57.500
That was my favorite part of the damn game.

02:53:57.500 --> 02:54:04.000
I have my game saved right there, so that I can watch her die over and over and over again.

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
It might cheer every time.

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:14.000
I forgot what it is, you should call her like a scum-sucking crack whore, and a homewrecker, and a man-stealer.

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:27.000
Here's why I'm not getting mad at you guys, because I'm pretty sure that nobody listening hasn't played the game or had the story spoiled already.

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
I mean if we had the whole world listening to us right now...

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:37.000
What about in the future when they have millions of listeners and they do a rebroadcast of

02:54:41.260 --> 02:54:41.880
this show?

02:54:41.880 --> 02:54:46.720
I guess I'm going to have to make this episode just disappear somehow.

02:54:46.720 --> 02:54:48.240
We'll bleep it out.

02:54:48.240 --> 02:54:55.240
Yeah, because millions of people are going to want to sit there and tune in and listen

02:54:55.240 --> 02:54:58.660
yeah and you know because millions of people are gonna want to sit there and

02:54:58.660 --> 02:55:03.820

This thing is great.

02:56:29.740 --> 02:56:30.740
Alright.

02:56:30.740 --> 02:56:32.740
It's a coyote.

02:56:37.740 --> 02:56:41.740
You know what? Well, does anybody else have a quick topic?

02:56:41.740 --> 02:56:43.740
Otherwise, I'm just going to go to final thoughts.

02:56:43.740 --> 02:56:44.740
Boobs.

02:56:44.740 --> 02:56:46.740
Boobs? You want to talk about boobs? What about boobs?

02:56:46.740 --> 02:56:48.740
Boobs are funny, but dicks are funnier.

02:56:48.740 --> 02:56:49.740
Why are they funny?

02:56:49.740 --> 02:57:07.460
funny? Cuz I look funny. Anyway... I seriously think that they're funny looking. I'm sorry,

02:57:07.460 --> 02:57:13.660
repeat that again Brad? You know what looks phallic? Your shower curtain. What do you

02:57:13.660 --> 02:57:15.660
What do you think? I mean...

02:57:15.660 --> 02:57:17.660
Loki bought it.

02:57:17.660 --> 02:57:21.660
It's... I swear it looks like...

02:57:21.660 --> 02:57:23.660
It looks...

02:57:23.660 --> 02:57:25.660
Doesn't it look like a dick?

02:57:25.660 --> 02:57:29.660
It's so cool.

02:57:29.660 --> 02:57:31.660
Great. So everybody's...

02:57:31.660 --> 02:57:33.660
Yeah, this is great radio, you guys.

02:57:33.660 --> 02:57:35.660
Rob Showerkern has a bunch of dicks on it.

02:57:35.660 --> 02:57:37.660
Loki bought it?

02:57:37.660 --> 02:57:39.660
No, no, no, no, no. Here.

02:57:39.660 --> 02:57:41.660
Don't even start going there.

02:57:41.660 --> 02:57:45.660
My girlfriend bought that for us, okay?

02:57:45.660 --> 02:57:48.660
Your girlfriend has a fetish.

02:57:48.660 --> 02:57:50.660
And this does not look like a penis.

02:57:50.660 --> 02:57:52.660
It looks like a cow or a lock.

02:57:52.660 --> 02:57:54.660
You're right, it doesn't look like a penis.

02:57:54.660 --> 02:57:57.660
It looks like several of them.

02:57:57.660 --> 02:58:03.660
Anybody, I don't know, if you haven't seen it yet, go look at...

02:58:03.660 --> 02:58:05.660
What's his name, Geiger?

02:58:05.660 --> 02:58:07.660
H.R. Geiger. Look at H.R. Geiger's works.

02:58:07.660 --> 02:58:10.660
Somebody should make a shower curtain out of one of H.R. Geiger's paintings.

02:58:10.660 --> 02:58:14.020
painting the one of all the dicks and vagina sticking each other and it's like

02:58:14.020 --> 02:58:21.660
a big mosaic thing of it it's really mosaic um yeah Brad I think that's

late f-you of the week that somehow I didn't get before my bad tyrant would

school I'm ready to be done I don't want to do finals

02:59:55.420 --> 03:00:03.820
Okay, I think it's time to get the final thoughts, what do you guys think?

03:00:03.820 --> 03:00:08.340
Alright, starting off with Brad, final thought of the day.

03:00:08.340 --> 03:00:13.860
The game shits the calories you burn while burninating.

03:00:13.860 --> 03:00:16.460
Final thought from Matt, the Ice Queen.

03:00:16.460 --> 03:00:17.460
Princess!

03:00:17.460 --> 03:00:23.420
Yes, Princess Bitch did it freaking right, I need more alcohol in my life, and sex, lots

03:00:23.420 --> 03:00:24.420
of sex.

03:00:24.420 --> 03:00:30.880
violence then you'll have all three six months boo-hoo shut up bitch rice

03:00:30.880 --> 03:00:40.020
princess your final thought this is we can get a mic over there it borrows

03:00:40.020 --> 03:00:44.020
into the ground. That's all I'm going to say.

03:00:44.020 --> 03:00:48.020
Okay.

03:00:48.020 --> 03:00:52.020
Oh, that's on the website, isn't it?

03:00:52.020 --> 03:00:56.020
No, I'm doing a thief.

03:00:56.020 --> 03:01:00.020
I must not have it yet.

03:01:00.020 --> 03:01:04.020
Yeah, explanation of that, real quick.

03:01:04.020 --> 03:01:08.020
The thief class has a skill named hide and it has such bad

03:01:08.020 --> 03:01:10.020
The entire script is horrible.

03:01:10.020 --> 03:01:14.020
It hides by burrowing into the ground or whatever.

03:01:14.020 --> 03:01:16.020
Burrowing in the ground.

03:01:16.020 --> 03:01:19.020
I only like to burrow in the ground. I don't like burrowing above ground, thanks.

03:01:19.020 --> 03:01:21.020
That's what the hide skill does.

03:01:21.020 --> 03:01:23.020
Anyway, that's boring so here.

03:01:23.020 --> 03:01:25.020
Loki, your final thought?

03:01:25.020 --> 03:01:28.020
My final thought is...

03:01:28.020 --> 03:01:30.020
If you're really, really, really, really desperate...

03:01:30.020 --> 03:01:35.020
I got this really cool pop-up ad today when I was browsing hacker sites.

03:01:35.020 --> 03:01:37.020
You know, one of those porno pop-ups.

03:01:37.020 --> 03:01:52.020
Anyways, it's this adult finder.com or something like that, and you go and you register and you can find people that just want to have sex in your area, and it's gay, straight, everything.

03:01:52.020 --> 03:01:54.020
That's kind of like gay.com.

03:01:54.020 --> 03:01:56.020
Well, yeah, but...

03:01:56.020 --> 03:01:58.020
You know this from experienced brats?

03:01:58.020 --> 03:01:59.020
I don't know what that is.

03:01:59.020 --> 03:02:03.020
The problem with gay.com in Sacramento is that everybody's already fucked everybody else.

03:02:03.020 --> 03:02:05.020
Doesn't mean you can have more sex.

03:02:05.020 --> 03:02:06.020
It's like what?

03:02:06.020 --> 03:02:08.020
You have sex once and then it's like, oh, can I have sex again?

03:02:08.020 --> 03:02:09.020
I'm sorry.

03:02:09.020 --> 03:02:10.020
Is that it?

03:02:10.020 --> 03:02:11.020
That is all.

03:02:11.020 --> 03:02:13.020
Uh, you want me to go or you wanna go?

03:02:13.020 --> 03:02:14.020
I'll go.

03:02:14.020 --> 03:02:16.520
I'm gonna just take my final thought from AZHP.

03:02:16.520 --> 03:02:23.020
He says, asparagus only smells bad if your gene for smelling asparagus-laden pee is dominant.

03:02:23.020 --> 03:02:27.020
That must mean my mind doesn't stink.

03:02:27.020 --> 03:02:28.020
Your final thought, Jamie?

03:02:28.020 --> 03:02:36.260
I'm never going to ask her again.

03:02:36.260 --> 03:02:42.420
My final thought for real is, GIVE ME A DOLLAR!

03:02:42.420 --> 03:02:43.420
Okay.

03:02:43.420 --> 03:02:44.420
That's it.

03:02:44.420 --> 03:02:47.500
Thanks for supporting Orange Moms Radio.

03:02:47.500 --> 03:02:50.340
I got x-ray vision.

03:02:50.340 --> 03:02:54.140
Final word, Rice Princess.

03:02:54.140 --> 03:02:55.140
Final word.

03:02:55.140 --> 03:02:56.140
Meow.

03:02:56.140 --> 03:03:00.620
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:03:00.620 --> 03:03:05.100

03:03:05.100 --> 03:03:07.460
We expect you a nice play again.

03:03:07.460 --> 03:03:12.460
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:03:12.460 --> 03:03:23.460
Uh huh, extra cheese, uh huh, uh huh, save the cheese for me.

03:03:23.460 --> 03:03:34.180
pizza party at your house i went just to check it out 19 extra lodges what a shame no one came

03:03:35.060 --> 03:03:44.740
just us eating all alone you said take the pizza home no sense letting all this go to waste

03:03:44.740 --> 03:03:52.260
so then i faced pizza all day and every day the speed round the clock is getting me blocked and

03:03:52.260 --> 03:03:57.060
And I sure don't care with irregularity

03:03:57.060 --> 03:04:02.260
Tell me why'd you have to go and make me so constipated

03:04:02.260 --> 03:04:08.260
Cause right now I'd do anything to just get my bowels evacuated

03:04:08.260 --> 03:04:12.260
In the bathroom I sit and I wait and I strain

03:04:12.260 --> 03:04:15.260
And I sweat and I clench and I feel the pain

03:04:15.260 --> 03:04:20.260
Oh, should I make laxatives or have my colon irrigated?

03:04:20.260 --> 03:04:22.260
No, no, no

03:04:24.260 --> 03:04:27.260
I was feeling pretty down

03:04:27.260 --> 03:04:30.260
Till my girlfriend came around

03:04:30.260 --> 03:04:34.260
We're just so alike in every way

03:04:34.260 --> 03:04:36.260
I gotta say

03:04:36.260 --> 03:04:39.260
In fact, I just thought I might

03:04:39.260 --> 03:04:42.260
Pop the question there that night

03:04:42.260 --> 03:04:45.260
I was kissing her so tenderly

03:04:45.260 --> 03:04:47.260
But woe is me

03:04:47.260 --> 03:04:50.260
Who would've guessed her family crest?

03:04:50.260 --> 03:04:53.260
I'd suddenly spy, tattooed on her thigh

03:04:53.260 --> 03:04:58.260
And son of a gun, it's just like the one on me

03:04:58.260 --> 03:05:03.260
Tell me, how was I supposed to know we were both related?

03:05:03.260 --> 03:05:09.260
Believe me, if I knew she was my cousin, we never would've dated

03:05:09.260 --> 03:05:13.260
What to do now? Should I go ahead and propose

03:05:13.260 --> 03:05:16.260
And get hitched and have kids with 11 toes

03:05:16.260 --> 03:05:21.260
and move to Alabama where that kind of thing is tolerated

03:05:21.260 --> 03:05:34.260
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

03:05:34.260 --> 03:05:37.260
I had so much on my mind

03:05:37.260 --> 03:05:40.260
I thought maybe I'd unwind

03:05:40.260 --> 03:05:44.260
try out that new roller coaster ride

03:05:44.260 --> 03:05:49.860
And the guide said not to stand Was that the demand that I couldn't meet?

03:05:49.860 --> 03:05:56.260
I got on my feet and stood up and said And knocked off my head, you see

03:05:56.260 --> 03:06:01.660
Tell me, would I have to go and get myself decapitated?

03:06:01.660 --> 03:06:07.460
This really is a major inconvenience, oh man, I really hate it

03:06:07.460 --> 03:06:13.260
The sun should dry now, can't eat, I can't breathe, I can't snore, I can't belt your yodel

03:06:13.260 --> 03:06:19.260
Anymore I can't sit and roll my nose or even read Sports Illustrated

03:06:19.260 --> 03:06:24.260
Oh no, might I have to go and get myself all mutilated

03:06:24.260 --> 03:06:26.260
Yeah, yeah, I gotta tell ya

03:06:26.260 --> 03:06:30.260
Life without a head kinda makes me irritated

03:06:30.260 --> 03:06:34.260
What a bummer, I can't blink, I can't cough, I can't sneeze

03:06:34.260 --> 03:06:38.260
But my neck is enjoying a pleasant breeze now

03:06:38.260 --> 03:06:42.260
Haven't been the same since my head and I was separated

03:06:42.260 --> 03:06:51.680
Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:07:12.260 --> 03:07:19.260
And we're back for the Orange Highlands afterbirth.

03:07:24.260 --> 03:07:31.260
And everybody's sitting here talking about the godliness of Weird Al.

03:07:32.260 --> 03:07:36.260
You want to hear godliness, I'll play the Eddie Murphy one.

03:07:37.260 --> 03:07:38.260
I don't know.

03:07:39.260 --> 03:07:40.260
We'll play the Eddie Murphy song.

03:07:40.260 --> 03:07:42.260
Oh God.

03:07:44.260 --> 03:07:49.260
My girl wants to potty all the time. Potty. Potty. Potty.

03:07:50.260 --> 03:07:57.260
Dude, yes. You should play the Human League one that I got you.

03:07:59.260 --> 03:08:05.260
Don't you want me baby? Don't you want me? Oh.

03:08:05.260 --> 03:08:18.340
Hi Brad, I just hit you Yeah, so, hi, how ya doin?

03:08:18.340 --> 03:08:22.700
Vinyl, I remember vinyl There's really not a lot to say for After

03:08:22.700 --> 03:08:27.140
Birth, I don't think Does anybody else have anything they wanna

03:08:27.140 --> 03:08:29.980

03:08:29.980 --> 03:08:33.180

03:09:25.740 --> 03:09:50.980
Hey, Loki, the chat room wants you to sing along with it.

03:09:50.980 --> 03:10:20.220
My girl wants to party all the time, party all the time, party all the time, party all

03:10:20.220 --> 03:10:33.660
party all the time. I go once to party all the time. Party all the time. I feel like

03:10:33.660 --> 03:10:42.620
I'm at a wedding and Matt's drunk. That will never happen. And that's not even at the reception.

03:10:42.620 --> 03:10:44.620
It's actually the actual ceremony, by the way.

03:10:54.220 --> 03:10:56.220
Body on the top.

03:10:57.020 --> 03:10:59.020
God, Eddie Murphy sucks.

03:11:00.220 --> 03:11:04.020
Girl, I've seen you in the club, just hanging out and dancing.

03:11:04.520 --> 03:11:05.520
Okay, thank you.

03:11:05.520 --> 03:11:08.520
You are not the next American Idol!

03:11:16.520 --> 03:11:18.520
Are you Elton and the Chipmunks album?

03:11:18.520 --> 03:11:21.520
Hey Justin, I have something from SyFam that you don't!

03:11:21.520 --> 03:11:25.520
I'm the best party, I'm the best party, I'm the best party all the time!

03:11:25.520 --> 03:11:30.520
My new one to party, I'm the best party all the time!

03:11:30.520 --> 03:11:42.760
That was beautiful, enough of that.

03:11:42.760 --> 03:11:45.500
I have to give Rob the biggest high five for that comment.

03:11:45.500 --> 03:11:47.760
That was comic gold.

03:11:47.760 --> 03:11:48.760
Oh my god.

03:11:48.760 --> 03:11:54.720
I gotta go change my shirt, that was too much.

03:11:54.720 --> 03:11:55.720
You know what?

03:11:55.720 --> 03:11:57.680
Our afterburns keep getting better and better.

03:11:57.680 --> 03:11:58.680
They really do.

03:11:58.680 --> 03:12:03.680
That started out pretty slow, but I think we should end it now, while we're ahead.

03:12:05.680 --> 03:12:07.680
Don't put that on.

03:12:07.680 --> 03:12:08.680
No!

03:12:08.680 --> 03:12:09.680
Put it on me!

03:12:10.680 --> 03:12:11.680
We have to.

03:12:11.680 --> 03:12:13.680
Put on your clothes! Put on your clothes!

03:12:13.680 --> 03:12:14.680
Matt, put your clothes back on.

03:12:17.680 --> 03:12:19.680
Okay, wait, we're doing another vinyl?

03:12:19.680 --> 03:12:20.680
Yes.

03:12:21.680 --> 03:12:22.680
I scare.

03:12:22.680 --> 03:12:24.680
Is Loki gonna sing along to this?

03:12:24.680 --> 03:12:25.680
He better.

03:12:25.680 --> 03:12:30.680
Okay, start your recorders now. Start your recording now, because I'm not recording it, so hurry up.

03:12:30.680 --> 03:12:33.680
I don't know the fucking lyrics to this song.

03:12:33.680 --> 03:12:36.680
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. Don't start yet.

03:12:36.680 --> 03:12:38.680
He's going to get the lyrics.

03:12:38.680 --> 03:12:39.680
I can't do it without laughing.

03:12:39.680 --> 03:12:41.680
You have to do this.

03:12:41.680 --> 03:12:45.680
If you're going to torture us with this music, you have to at least sing with it.

03:12:45.680 --> 03:12:49.680
And then do the speed mix.

03:12:49.680 --> 03:12:50.680
Come here.

03:12:50.680 --> 03:12:54.680
No, we don't want to use that dog too much.

03:12:54.680 --> 03:13:01.680
One trick puppy. Oh god. Here we go. Alright, here we go.

03:13:14.680 --> 03:13:17.680
Why did you make me do that?

03:13:17.680 --> 03:13:19.680
I don't even know how to...

03:13:19.680 --> 03:13:21.680
I'll tell your baby.

03:13:28.680 --> 03:13:30.680
I don't even know how to kick it.

03:13:30.680 --> 03:13:32.680
Just take it. Jesus.

03:13:38.680 --> 03:13:40.680
You didn't play the instrumental version, did you?

03:13:40.680 --> 03:13:42.680
No, I picked the extended mix.

03:13:42.680 --> 03:13:44.680
You picked the extended mix?

03:13:44.680 --> 03:13:46.680
Here, let me fix it.

03:13:49.680 --> 03:13:51.680
Put it on the other side.

03:13:51.680 --> 03:13:52.680
Ah, fine.

03:13:52.680 --> 03:13:54.680
Low-key ruining everything. Good.

03:13:54.680 --> 03:13:56.680
More time for people to start the recording.

03:13:57.680 --> 03:13:59.680
Ah, here we go. This should probably work.

03:13:59.680 --> 03:14:00.680
Alright.

03:14:00.680 --> 03:14:02.680
Alright, here we go.

03:14:03.680 --> 03:14:04.680
Is this the real version now?

03:14:04.680 --> 03:14:05.680
This is the real version.

03:14:05.680 --> 03:14:21.680
Yeah, I'm happy because I'm not the one making that ass on that fucking mic.

03:14:21.680 --> 03:14:22.680
Why?

03:14:22.680 --> 03:14:24.680
Is this because I want to play my music?

03:14:24.680 --> 03:14:25.680
Yes, you are.

03:14:25.680 --> 03:14:27.680
...

03:14:29.200 --> 03:14:31.200
oh ei oh ei oh

03:14:31.200 --> 03:14:33.200
oh ei oh ei oh

03:14:33.200 --> 03:14:35.200
oh ei oh ei oh

03:14:35.200 --> 03:14:37.200
oh ei oh ei oh

03:14:37.200 --> 03:14:39.200
oh ei oh ei oh

03:14:39.200 --> 03:14:41.200
oh ei oh ei oh

03:14:41.200 --> 03:14:42.880
Well, I can eat your shit

03:14:42.880 --> 03:14:44.480
Yeah! Where the hell is the lyrics?

03:14:44.480 --> 03:14:46.480
Loki your vinyl sucks my ass

03:14:52.560 --> 03:14:54.560
Nita do well

03:14:54.600 --> 03:14:55.240
No

03:14:55.240 --> 03:15:00.240
It's a fun way to trip and take their trades, spin around and then cross the floor

03:15:01.240 --> 03:15:03.240
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh

03:15:04.240 --> 03:15:09.240
All the school kids so sick of books they like to poke and they'll pay it

03:15:10.240 --> 03:15:12.240
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh

03:15:16.240 --> 03:15:18.240
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh

03:15:19.240 --> 03:15:22.240
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh

03:15:22.240 --> 03:15:23.240
Here we go, here we go.

03:15:23.240 --> 03:15:25.240
Walk like he needs gym shit.

03:15:25.240 --> 03:15:26.240
There you go.

03:15:28.240 --> 03:15:29.240
This sucks.

03:15:29.240 --> 03:15:30.240
No kidding.

03:15:32.240 --> 03:15:34.240
I think the extended mix would have been better.

03:15:41.240 --> 03:15:42.240
Spin the disc yo.

03:15:42.240 --> 03:15:43.240
Thank you.

03:15:43.240 --> 03:15:51.640
You're breaking speakers across the internet.

03:15:51.640 --> 03:16:00.720
Alright, I think now is a good time to put the gun in the pervial forehead of Orange

03:16:00.720 --> 03:16:01.720
Launch Radio.

03:16:01.720 --> 03:16:02.720
Okay, that's it.

03:16:02.720 --> 03:16:03.720
We're signing off.

03:16:03.720 --> 03:16:04.720
End of afterbirth.

03:16:04.720 --> 03:16:09.360
We're going to pick you now since it's six months into the year June 1st.

03:16:09.360 --> 03:16:13.320
I think this is a good time to revive our non-stop New Years.

03:16:13.320 --> 03:16:14.320
So enjoy.

03:16:14.320 --> 03:16:18.240
We're going to start it off with ZipMania Beth and take you out throughout the evening.

03:16:18.240 --> 03:16:19.760
Thanks for tuning in to Orange Launch Radio.

03:16:19.760 --> 03:16:20.760
We appreciate your support.

03:16:20.760 --> 03:16:22.080
Please score up our listening hours.

03:16:22.080 --> 03:16:23.080
We definitely need it.

03:16:23.080 --> 03:16:26.200
Vote us a five and vote Legend of Max a ten onto my cell.

03:16:26.200 --> 03:16:31.440
Remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter and vote for Legend of

03:16:31.440 --> 03:16:32.440
Trance.

03:16:32.440 --> 03:16:33.440
What did I say?

03:16:33.440 --> 03:16:34.440
Legend of Max.

03:16:34.440 --> 03:16:35.440
Oh my bad.

03:16:35.440 --> 03:16:36.440
Legend of Trance.

03:16:36.440 --> 03:16:41.440
Oh, oh, oh, and someone needs to mix me, um, the Sandbone Trio MX300, thank you.
