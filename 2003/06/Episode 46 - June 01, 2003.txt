Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, for Monty Talk and then some.
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
Yes, I will spank your child.
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.
Well...
Here's my big opening.
A sphincter says what?
I'm super, thanks for asking.
Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.
What am I doing here?
No.
Dodge this.
This is a tasty burger.
Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.
Yes, I have.
Look, just a flesh wound.
Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.
Oh yeah?
Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.
DarkSakura.
I've got a sniff.
Skye.
But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.
Loki.
I hate you!
Orange Lounge Radio.
Oh, the fighting's already begun.
We are live, and this is episode number 46 for June the 1st of 2003.
You're tuned in to The Beast!
and the money scenes.
Most super radio station of all things the money.
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Transformer herself, Jamie Summers.
You gave us all stars.
I did.
You know her better as Dark Sakura.
In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.
I have a clean bill of health.
You have a what?
Clean bill of health.
And also with us tonight, we have one special guest.
Say hello to the rice princess, Irene.
Hi, guys.
Brad and Matt are coming later.
They're going to get my mountain bike from his parents' house because I'm trying to lose weight.
Oh, okay.
Bike, Bike Revolution I made a vow.
Huh?
I made a vow.
I'm going to play five songs, five games of DDR every day.
At home?
At Scandia.
Every day?
Every day.
Every day?
After work.
After work.
Wow.
I need to get motivated to that.
We'll talk about some workout techniques later.
In the meantime, we're going to do some quick break.
We're going to have a fantabulous break.
We're going to play...
I'm going to play the new promo, a brand new promo.
Irene's all excited to hear it.
I worked hard on this one today.
This was like an hour today.
Rob, work hard now.
I know.
Stop the presence.
But actually, before that, we're going to have some music from 2DX7Style.
Because it's underrated.
I think it's underrated because obviously Konami in Tokyo doesn't like it because they haven't put out a home version of it yet.
Bitches.
So fuck them in their ears.
Alright, so we'll be back after some fabulous 2DX7 Sound Music.
Thank you for watching!
Outro Music
Orange Lounge Radio is proud to present a celebrity interview.
Can you introduce yourself for our listeners?
I'm Miss Cleo.
Oh, it's great to have you on the show today.
Hello, how are you today?
I'm great, thanks.
Did you have a question?
Well, yes, actually I wanted to know... Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please?
Uh...
Well, no, I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.
Alright, go ahead.
Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?
Is he incarcerated?
Uh, actually, no, he's not.
But what do you think of the ever-ranty DarkSakura?
Hi, dear, how are you?
I love you.
I see you two must know each other.
Well, what do you think of Skye?
Did he used to play football when he was in high school?
Well, actually, no, he didn't.
Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?
I want you to really remember...
The Pill, all right?
I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly.
And I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.
Right.
Okay, well, thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.
I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but who are all of these nosy people?
Outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card.
Get away from me.
Ha, ha, ha.
Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.
I'm Miss Cleo.
I love you.
Wait, sorry, we are muted.
Hi, welcome back.
That was so fucked up.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 46.
I still have SARS.
This is bad.
This is very bad that I'm still sick after so much time.
It's allergies.
It's not sick.
It's the allergies.
No, it's not allergies.
I swear.
It's the sick of the air.
I think I have a brain tumor.
It's not the tumor.
No, seriously.
Like, my head hurts, like, right up around here.
It's not like a headache.
It's like a... I'll hit you somewhere else in your head and you won't hurt anymore.
That's really filthy.
Get away from me.
Oh, my God.
You put the hat on Cartman.
Yes, I did.
DarkSakura.com
I don't know.
By the way, you know what you didn't do last week, even though I burned them for you?
What?
Those Night Style songs from the test location.
Oh, you're right.
I conveniently... We burned them.
Oh, you did?
Well, I played some of them a few weeks ago, but, you know, we can play some... Those are ones that you didn't have.
We'll do some Night Style songs the next break.
Uh-huh.
They're kind of crappy.
The quality is, anyway.
I'd like to... Excuse me.
Okay, Kermit.
What are you talking about, bitch?
I'm just kidding.
I'd like to apologize to Maren Chan right off the bat because I gave her SARS when she was here last week.
I'm really sorry.
Sorry, Maren.
Is she listening?
Of course she's listening.
Hi!
What, Loki?
Oh, Loki's talking about causing pain to the masses and things like that.
Let's see, what else?
Oh yeah, my brain tumor.
So, but what's really weird, now it's like in my ear, so I'm thinking maybe I have an ear infection.
But then... Rodney, we need to go to Walmart and get you a new head.
Hey, hey, Irene, Rodney's head.
Whoa, wait till Brad gets here, okay?
It kind of reminds me, you remember, and I can make this Bomani related, you remember in Max PC...
I'm John Max, you see, D.R.P.C., remember Jason Enos' character?
How, like, the head was really small than the rest of the body?
It made it look like, it looked like, it reminded me of that scene from Return to Oz, where the witch, like, had all the heads in a jar.
Oh, God.
And, like, she could take into it, because the head looked faked.
It looked like it was just, like, screwed on.
Yeah.
Dude, Return to Oz was an awesome movie.
Good reference.
I liked it because it was, like, just like the book.
You know what I think we need to do on Orange Haunts Radio some night?
See if this is a rating success.
Read!
See if it's a rating success or a ratings disaster.
Because we have this neat new mixing board.
We can loop in the TV.
So we should watch a movie and comment along with it.
It'll be like Mystery Science Theater on the radio.
We need to watch Reading Rainbow.
I am so sad.
You can't AP Reading Rainbow.
I am sad.
Why?
About them not having any more money to do more Reading Rainbow.
They haven't canceled Reading Rainbow yet.
Yeah, but they can only do, what, four shows a year?
I know, it's sad.
That sucks.
They better not cancel Reading Rainbow.
What will LeVar Burton do?
That, like, sucks.
Oh, my God.
LeVar Burton will, like, have to retire because he's got... But he's a certified genius.
He can get... That's true.
They'll pay him for being smart.
You know what I saw on Game Show Network the other day?
What?
I saw The Weakest Link, Star Trek Edition.
That was great.
And he won.
Well, yeah.
He's, like, an actual... Isn't he... What's his name?
Yeah, he's Mensa.
And not only did he win, he got like the highest jackpot in that game's history up to that point or something like that.
Isn't that fabulous?
This is really smart.
See, I enjoy hearing about smart people because the world is mostly full of idiots.
Okay?
So... Smart people bring a smile to my face almost as much as seeing idiots, you know, die violent, horrible, bloody deaths.
Do you have any fun idiot watching stories to tell this week?
Have you been out to the various arcades and seen any idiots?
Just been driving on the road, plenty of idiots there.
And I was at the mall today, you know, good figure.
Oh, how was the rest of your day with Sharkskrull and Mel B, who were in town today?
Well, you were there for Mongo Chow.
Right, I was there for Mongo Chow.
And then we decided that we were going to go to the Idiot Mecca of Sacramento, which is Arden Fair Mall.
And of course, there's also the Idiot Mecca of Roseville, which is, you know, the Galleria.
What about Golfland?
That's just like the retard mecca.
There's a difference between idiots and retarded people.
Of course, calling that the retard mecca would probably insult retarded people everywhere.
Okay.
Anyway, there were lots of stupid people everywhere and they were all driving and they were in the parking garage and we found like a really nice parking spot because it was in the second level of the garage by Sears so it was all shady.
It's still hot and hot sucks.
And then all the expresses everywhere are closed.
Everywhere.
Everywhere.
The stores?
Yeah.
Why?
Because they're remodeling or something.
That sucks.
She came all the way out here.
So Sharkskull wasted her trip completely?
Well, no, because she got something at Hot Topic.
That's true.
She got a big, sloppy, fuzzy black hat.
Whoa.
It's a hat.
Sounds kind of kinky.
It's a hat.
And we went to Torrid.
No, it's not a kinky hat.
It's a cute hat.
And we went to Torrid, and I looked at clothes I can't buy yet because I haven't gotten paid, and...
And then we listened to Strong Bad on the way home.
Then we went to Scandia, ran into DJ Syndrome, and ran into... We need to get him on the show some night.
We ran into Ryan, some name I guess.
We need to get him back on the show some night.
I know, because he's been falling off the face of the earth.
No kidding, and where's Intern Zero?
Intern Zero is probably working.
Oh, that's true.
Because remember, he works for my man now.
That's right.
He is now indirectly my bitch.
And all of these celebrity interviews that we'll be doing in future weeks, you know, we'll always ask about Intern Zero, because we're always curious about, you know, what the celebrities think of our intern.
Because we're very privileged to have Intern Zero on board here.
Well, it's, you know, we have a very privileged group, and, you know, we need to not forget about our foreign correspondent from the People's Republic of Davis, Abandoned Hope, all you who enter here, TM.
Yeah, we need to get Puppy back on the show, too.
Yeah, we need Puppy.
Puppy, get your ass back out here.
Now, or we spank you with a rolled up newspaper.
Bad puppy.
I'm waiting for the big sniff in the chat room.
Waiting, waiting.
Oh, if you want to join our chat room, head on over to www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and then click on chat.
Chat, chat, chat, chat, chat.
And then you can chat with our chatters in the chat room.
And I feel really irresponsible because we're supposed to be working on the Battle Royale role-playing instead of him playing Ragnarok.
Ha!
Ha!
I am so glad that it's gone pay-to-play.
I am seriously thinking of starting Ragnarok now, because, like, I was watching Brad play the other night.
It was comedy gold.
Isn't it great?
Well, you tell your Ragnarok story first.
Okay, they went pay-to-play, which is the best thing that could have ever happened.
I mean, sure, I'm going to have friends who I used to... who helped me level and get where I am today, character-wise, who are not going to pay-to-play.
But, like, one friend gave me...
Like 250,000 zenny, which was a lot of the money in the game So I went out and bought a bunch of armor And now my character's badass And on top of that, since they introduced the pay-to-play Like today's the actual day it starts The server congestion went from about 13,000 people logged in To 6,500 Right around there Therefore there's no lag All of you people who decided to quit, thank you I love you
But see, I'm thinking about starting to join now after watching Brad play the other day.
That's fine.
Now, you and Brad play on different servers, though.
Yes, play on Chaos.
Can you move your character from one server to another?
Nope, you'll lose everything.
That's ass.
That is so ass.
But you can make two characters, one on each server.
That might work.
But you have to play on Chaos with me.
Okay, but if I do it, if, if.
I still have to cancel my PSO account first.
Mine was already canceled, believe it or not.
Really?
I didn't even know mine was canceled.
I looked up my stuff on...
If you go to Sega.com slash PSO underscore GCN I wonder if they just cancel you automatically if you don't play.
Bless their little hearts if that's what they do.
They keep your information there in case you want to start back up.
But I might start PSO back up later.
But for right now, that's been my... I'll play, then I'll let my character sit and heal while I go off and do other stuff.
Marin has given us the Ragnarok report.
There is currently 3,800 people logged into Chaos.
Thank you.
And see, I'm so glad that she's paying to play too, because then I get my sauce on Ragnarok with me, and I can say, I have 50 fire arrows for you.
Okay, for those that don't play Ragnarok online, you visit the website www.
Ragnarok online.
R-A-G-N-A...
R-O-K online dot com.
Excellent.
Maybe somebody in the chat room will be so kind as to post a link.
And it's $12 a month unless you do pay by cash.
Then it's a little bit more because of the service charge.
But it's not continuously updating your pay.
So you have to pay every month manually.
That's actually good.
You can pay up to six months in advance.
I paid three.
It's a little bit cheaper to pay three months or six months in advance.
But I paid three months in advance.
and if you want to find me on there, my username is Sorato, it's the only one I have.
So what's the game like?
It's kind of like, the best way I can describe it is kind of like a multiplayer Secret of Mana.
Yeah, it's like playing Secret of Mana, you have your individual character, you can form a party, you can share experience, which is really good if you're all trying to get levels quickly, because then every time you fight something, you'll all gain levels together.
You can buy stuff, upgrade your armor, you can make your own quest.
There's also bosses hidden in the game where you and a billion other people can just tag team and rape this guy.
Tag team raping only on Ragnarok Online.
Like the Troll King or something.
In the chat room, RiceRYC3 says, It's like Diablo 2 but cuter.
I've been hearing it's not like Ultima.
Ultima Online.
Oh, I never did play that.
It's all point and click killing stuff.
Let me tell my funny, because I was watching, or actually it's really Brad's funny.
I was watching Brad play the other day, and I guess he was talking about this guy who was, you know, because of the server change, there's a lot of people, or the fact that they're going pay-to-play, there was a lot of people giving shit away on there.
So there was this guy, and he stood there, and he said, I'm going to give away my armor, and it's like this super rare armor.
He says, I'm going to give away my armor in ten minutes.
I'll be right back.
So he, you know, he says that, and then all these people just start crowding around him, like tons and tons of people.
He's probably got lots of whispers.
I mean, just masses of people around him.
And then after ten minutes of this up, he goes, just kidding, and runs away.
There was a guy in there.
Leaving all the people standing there.
Who kept dropping cards and then picking them up.
And then he's like, I'm going to drop all my cards, because cards are like, they're a one in one million item or something that you can fit.
I've gotten like a bajillion of them.
Anyway, he says he's going to give away all of his cards.
And so he drops one card, which is like a pouring card, which is like this little pink bubble thing, which is the weakest character in the game.
And then he starts dropping like twigs, branches, flowers, which are all like little crap stuff.
Awesome.
The other thing I watched Brad do, I actually suggest this, because this is the crazy thing about Ragnarok Online, is that when you go into the towns, there's just...
Masses of people there.
I mean... Hi, we're AFK and clogging the server.
Oh my god, there's just people just standing there in the middle of the town.
I mean, it looks like China.
in there, I swear to God.
Hey, and you can get flu masks in the game.
You can put yourself up for Ragnarok cars.
I swear to God, Ragnarok online looks like China.
So, like, you go into the middle of the street or whatever, so I told Brad, hey, there's that big clusterfuck of people standing in the middle of the screen.
Go run around them and go, I have SARS, cough, cough, cough.
And so he did it.
He ran in, he ran in the middle of the group, and he's all, I have SARS, cough, cough, cough.
Literally, the second after he did that, someone summoned a monster into town that just started running around killing all the people that were idling.
It was great.
And Brad's like, gotta go!
This is great, though, because people have been protesting the charge.
Which is, I think, so retarded.
Because they knew from the beginning that the whole reason that they were beta testing us is that you would eventually pay for the service.
So this is great.
And for all you people who play, I don't know if they still have it up, but this is hilarious.
There's a warp.
And the phone's ringing.
Okay.
There's a warp.
We can't take phone calls on the show yet, sorry.
On the south gate of, uh, Pontera, which is like the middle, uh, town.
And, uh... Oh, stop picking it up.
What?
It's spam.
Oh, it's spam?
Yeah.
Do not ruin this show to bring us...
Hand, hand, hand, hey, hand, hey, hand, hand, hey That could have been the most important call of my life, according to that Hand, come here, hand, hand, hand I was only telling a story Alright, sorry Jamie They set up a warp right in the gate, the south gate of town So if you leave town, you go into this warp And it warps you to the Christmas village
So like you're in, and everybody is trapped in a corral with no way out.
That's right.
So the only way you can get out is to use something called a fly wing, which will teleport you to another part of town.
Luckily for me, I have a fly wing, so I go to the other part of town.
And there's always people going, let us out, let us out.
And I'm like, ah.
And then I got killed.
And then I went back there.
and like if you leave there you have to like dodge abominable snowmans and things and like they'll like they're aggressive so they chase you but I have high agility so I run away this is a fun topic I want to solicit stories from the chat room if anybody has any funny online game stories this is really nerdy but it can be funny
If anybody has any really good online game stories that are funny, send them to me in private message in the chatroom.
Well, this is the part that sucks.
The only way out of the Christmas Village, besides warping, is going through the south warp past all the aggressive creatures.
It takes you to a city called Aldebaran, which is like way in the north.
The only way to get out of that town is to walk past three screens full of aggressive creatures that will kill me in two hits.
And I made it out.
I was happy.
The wizards or whatever, weren't they the ones that were like, you have to pay me to get out of here and I can warp you out of here?
Yeah, they have the ability to warp.
And some of them in the game, they're just like, may I have the heal, please?
And they'll heal you.
I'm like, hey, cool.
And I ran into a swordman.
Swordies are cool to hang out with because they'll kill stuff for you.
If you're low level, they'll kill stuff and then they'll let you tank on them.
Which tanking means they'll attack a creature once so that the creature keeps hitting them over and over.
And you can kill the creature and get the experience from it.
and so I hung out with one who killed a bunch of people for me and then I left.
Does Ragnarok still have really bad English?
Yes, it's beautiful.
It's core English.
Because remember, it's Korean.
Okay, so I'm going to shift gears and talk about a different online game that we brought up earlier, PSO.
I think I mentioned this on a previous show, but I'll tell you the funniest thing I've ever seen in PSO.
Were you there, Loki, when I was watching this?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
There were all these people standing there and then one guy decides to just start running laps around the room.
He's just running around in a giant circle.
You actually can see everybody watching him as he's running around the circle on the screen.
And people are going, what the hell?
And then suddenly a couple other guys decide to join him and they all start running around in a circle.
And then suddenly the entire server room is doing a big conga line.
It was the gayest thing ever, but it was so funny.
I'm going to send some pictures for next week.
I have pictures.
Every so often I'll save the screen capture for when I'm playing Ragnarok.
I have a picture of this place in the desert town where I was getting my weapons upgraded and some friends met me there and then random people were there and we all formed a conga line.
StaplerX has an interesting story to share here in our chat room.
He says, My friend Chris made a female account.
and as soon as he logged in, a guy started flirting with him.
He kept stalking him until he logged out and he never used the account again.
Do you ever find yourself getting hit on as a female game player?
All the time, but it's a good thing because they give me stuff.
I have a story.
We played, well this was back when Ultima Online was first getting started and we were just being really stupid so what we did was we stripped our character of all of his clothes and just said he got player killed
and kept begging for stuff from people.
And the player's name was Italian Sausage.
And so, um, we were just running around yelling Sausage for Sale and just being, like, really annoying.
Wait, what game was this?
Ultima Online.
Oh, okay, Ultima Online.
It was fun.
We were really bored that day.
There's also a lot of idiots on Ragnarok.
Just randomly, I was in this one place that, um, that, um, Marienchan, uh, showed me.
This is an island that you have to get to from Alberta.
Anyway, we were just sitting there.
Like, I'm in the cave leading in.
I'm just waiting.
So I set up a chat room in there.
Said, toll booth 200 zeni.
And people paid me.
I got like 600.
That's awesome.
And other people, this is a great idea.
They set up a kissing booth.
Because there's an emoticon in the game that makes a smoochie and then a little heart comes up.
And they're making money.
So I want to do, though, what one of my friends did.
I forgot who this was.
It was so long ago.
One of the people I was playing with back when I first was playing the second beta, decided, they wrote on the pages, like, sex or 500 zenny or something.
Or 5,000.
And so, the person went in there and paid up front.
She was like, haha, you got fucked.
That's great.
So, okay, we can bring this around to Bomani somehow, believe it or not, because with the new DDR going to go online,
Oh, yay.
Oh, yay.
I think it should be like DanceMagic.
This is why we should work for Konami.
I'm looking for funny stories right now.
Are you enjoying that food?
Thank you.
More funny online gaming stories.
What?
I think so.
They're probably in the cupboard up there.
Anyway.
Hi.
Rice, RYC3, would like to say, This one time I was playing Counter-Strike and the server had friendly fire on.
I just entered the server and killed this guy for his gun.
He got pissed and I left the server.
Meanie.
Yeah, you can have some Triscuits.
Dieter, our angel, has a story to share.
Dad and I were playing Diablo 2 on our own server.
We came to Upper Cresat and go after the council members one by one.
I start running around just to get the little monsters to get experience.
Next thing you know, somehow I end up having all seven council members chasing me.
I scream, help!
Dad goes, how did you do that?
I go, I don't know.
Dad proceeds to kill all their asses in less than five minutes while I lay there dead.
That's so interesting, because I've never heard of anybody playing online games with their parents.
That would scare me, to run into my mother.
Like, Terry would totally, I could see that happening, like, when his kids get older, he'd be gaming with them.
Well, he's just cool like that, and you know that any of us, when we have kids, we're going to play games with our kids, too, but I just, as it is now, I could never imagine, like, my mother, or my dad, no, my dad's actually computer savvy, and there are some computer games he's played in the past, mostly solitaire and shit, like card games, but...
If I were to run into him on an online game, I'd, like, zap him so he couldn't, like, he couldn't embarrass me.
I'd kill him.
You know what my party is named?
Huh?
My party is named Battle Royale.
Of course.
I want to make a guild called Battle Royale.
Or BR Act.
The BR Act.
Um...
I really like that idea of DDR Online having a dancing conquest.
That would be cool.
That would be awesome.
What other cool DDR Online ideas have people thought of in their... How about this?
How about they don't make it?
Ooh, there's an idea.
I know what's wrong.
You're here.
Shut up, bitch.
That has nothing to do with the topic of the ad.
I think they should make Stroker Online, because that combination would work great.
Nobody gets that, Loki.
Nobody.
I don't care.
You know what game they need to make another one of?
What?
Freaking Night Trap.
Night Trap 2.
That would be the shit.
Did you hear that?
Oh, wait.
No, Night Trap wasn't on 3DO.
It was a Sega CD game, wasn't it?
I own the damn game.
It was a Sega CD.
3DO filed for bankruptcy this week.
Yay!
And whenever I think of 3DO, though, I think of that horrible, horrible, horrible Zelda game.
That was a CD-I.
That was a CD-I.
Wasn't that 3DO?
No, it was 3DX.
Never mind.
3DO I'll always remember as the first time playing You Don't Know Jack.
What the fuck did 3DO do then?
They made the stupid Army Man games.
Didn't they have a system?
Wasn't there a system called 3DO?
There was a 3DO, but I don't think it was the same people.
What the fuck was on the 3DO system?
Flashback.
That's it?
That was their biggest game was Flashback?
They had this, like, it was supposedly this, you know...
What was it called?
The something M technology?
They had Road Rage.
Okay, here we go.
Road Rage.
Eternal Champions.
Thank you, chat room.
Eternal Champions was not on the freaking 3DO.
Are you sure?
I'm more than positive Kabuki Clash was on the 3DO.
I just remember those things were like 400 bucks.
Fuck that.
Eternal Champions was on the Genesis and the Eternal Champions CD was on the Sega CD.
I own the game and I should know.
I even bought...
What was the thing called?
The Menacer?
Wasn't that what it was called?
The Activator.
I have got a Menacer.
But I've got an Activator too.
The one that's like the arena.
I bought it at Virgin like a year ago.
Yeah, and it came with Eternal Champions.
It's in my closet.
You know what?
I kind of want a CDI system and a 3DO just because
You know, nobody has them.
You know what shitty system I want?
What?
A Jaguar CD.
I want a Jaguar.
So I can play Defender 2000.
I want Tempest 2000.
Okay, you can get it on Saturn then.
Okay, but I want the Jaguar version.
Same damn name.
But it's Atari system and it's Atari game, so... And it's easier to control on the... Shush!
That's it.
You've got a Saturn, right?
Do I have a Saturn?
Loki has a Saturn.
I'll bring you over Tempest 2000 next week.
Oh, dear Lord.
That's it.
Pre-show next week should be all Tempest 2000 songs.
I'm down with that.
Actually, I want to do... Jamie, you have to let me do one pre-show one week because I want to do... Yes.
I want to do Commodore 64 music.
Oh, my God, yes.
Did you hear what Bradley posted in response to your Commodore 64?
Hold on.
Let me bring it up.
Okay.
Okay.
For those of you that listen to Orange Lingerie like all the time, that would be the cool people.
On Friday night, you would have heard me doing a fuck-off show because I was really bored and Irene flaked on me for going out Friday night.
So I played a bunch of 80s music and that led into talk about Commodore 64.
Because the Commodore 64 was like the coolest computer system ever.
And it just turned 20 years old like two months ago.
But anyway, so I had a point to this.
Oh yeah, I started downloading all these games and stuff.
and one of them, one of the most memorable games for me on Commodore 64 was Impossible Mission.
Tell us a little bit about Impossible Mission, Irene.
It was really cheesy.
It had really bad voice acting and you basically had to try to like put them together as well.
They were like pieces of paper that had little, you know, squiggly marks and stuff.
But anyway, it had really bad like pseudo voice acting.
and Rob's going to be pulling up a special treat or whatever.
It was really hard.
You had to time it and if you didn't beat it by then, then you died for some reason.
I don't really remember.
Yeah, but it was a great game.
Hey Rob, you know what I want to bring over?
What?
My ColecoVision.
What do you have on ColecoVision?
What don't I have?
That was the Odyssey.
My bad.
You don't even have a TV that my Odyssey will work with.
You need one of those old ones with, like, the prong hookup thingies.
Okay, hold on.
I'm going to download that sound clip we were talking about earlier.
Oh, my God.
If I can get it.
But we need to play Smurfs.
Or I can bring over the 2600 and we can play the worst game ever.
What?
E.T.
Or Pac-Man.
I saw this hilarious commercial on G4 today.
There was this guy, and I guess he was a programmer or whatever, and he says, Hey, I'm so-and-so.
and I programmed Yar's Revenge and I programmed, um, he said, I programmed Yar's Revenge and I programmed, what was the other thing he'd done?
And then he goes, he said, I programmed Yar's Revenge, I programmed Raiders of the Lost Ark and I programmed E.T.
He's like that.
He's like, so I'm known for one of the best 2600 games of all time and one of the worst.
Anyway, oh, here's that sound file we were talking about earlier, kids.
Arrrr!
Arrrr!
Arrrr!
That's the sound every time you die or fall down a hole or you see Irene naked.
Don't touch.
Wait, what, Loki?
It should be in the next intro, he says.
Yes, I agree.
You know what?
You know what?
I'll bring the 5200 over and we'll play Kicks.
I've actually got promo for the prototype.
They did... And they put these out, I think, at one of the classic gaming conventions, which I want to go to in Vegas.
But they... I think it's Classic Gaming Expo is the one that's in Vegas every year.
Oh, I hell want to go to that.
When is that?
I don't... I think it's in August is when it's coming up.
I hope it's not the same weekend as Cyber Beat Nation 2.
I don't know.
But... Well, anyway...
They have prototype games.
They've actually cartridge-ized and everything.
And this guy sold them on eBay.
We picked up Super Pac-Man, which is my favorite Pac-Man game.
Yes, I agree.
Super Pac-Man is the best Pac-Man game.
And we picked up Millipede.
I've got a trackball.
Ah, cool.
Nothing beats playing Millipede on a 5200 with a trackball.
There's very few experiences that are as beautiful as that.
Except playing kicks.
I have a quick Bomani-related question when it comes to Atari 2600.
Wasn't somebody trying to develop Dance Dance Revolution for the 2600?
Yes.
Whatever happened with that?
Loki, you probably follow that stuff better than any of us.
No, it's because people still program for the 2600 for I don't know what reason.
Because it's fun.
They were trying to create like a sort of Dance Dance Revolution type game.
And the problem is they had to do it horizontally instead of vertically because I guess the vertical refresh rate isn't as fast as the horizontal refresh rate or something like that.
It's like playing Beatmania on the WonderSwan.
Yeah, you were saying?
Anyway, so yeah, I don't think that it ever went anywhere.
Know what I want to get?
They have for your cell phones...
Or for certain cell phones, you know how you can put games on there?
Yeah, pump it up.
Yeah, I heard about that.
But I couldn't find where you download it.
I think it's only for Korean cell phones.
There's pictures on one of the DDR Live Journal things.
I'm too lazy to go look them up.
Triscuits are garlicky.
I think we need to take a break.
Let's take a quick break.
We're going to do a break and this is... They still have the memory of cheese attached to them.
We're going to play some 9th style songs this break.
So the quality of the MP3s is kind of eh.
But you guys might enjoy these anyway.
So it's a free preview here of what's coming up on Night Style.
We're going to play the following songs.
Emotion, 2003, Romantic Extra, Abyss, Let's Say Hello, and Distress.
So we're going to hear all those fabulous Night Style songs.
And then we'll be back.
Sound like a plan.
Word.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
If you want to join in the fun in the chat room, and they're all reminiscing about classic video games right now, I'm seeing all these great games being named right now.
Adventure, Beachhead, Mule, or I should say M-U-L-E, Warlord, Combat, anyway.
So we will be right back after some Night Style MP3s.
So the quality of these is kind of eh, but it will give you an impression of what you can look forward to very soon.
we'll be back

It's more contagious than SARS.
It's Orange Lounge Radio.
Howdy.
We're back.
How are you?
SARS-erific.
I hope you enjoyed those 9th style preview songs.
I know the quality was a little poopy, but, you know, they always are at first.
I'm surprised we haven't had better ones by this point yet, though.
I'm so happy about the second to last one.
The Let's Say Hello?
Uh-huh.
That one is cool.
That song's cute.
It sounds worthy of, like, poppin' music-ness.
It makes me think of Murmur Twins.
You think it's the same group?
I don't think it is.
No, it just makes me think of Murmur Twins.
I don't know who did that, and I'm too lazy to look it up right now.
So, we're back.
Hello, how are you?
I'm trying to think.
I'm hazelnutty.
And garlicky.
I noticed Loki's working on some things over there.
You want to do the cage match?
Sure, did I bring a song?
You did bring a song.
Okay, I forgot if I did.
Yes, you did.
Okay, we're going to do the cage match.
So, because we usually don't do the cage match early in the show, we're just going to throw people through the loop.
This is the last week you can win.
Has he been four weeks?
Yes.
Oh, yes, this will be the fourth week.
Because Mona Lisa Overdrive had two weeks the first time because of B3.
Oh, we've got more people here.
Hello.
It's men.
Hello, boys and girls.
It's men.
Oh, sorry, I dropped your Triscuits.
It's men's?
We are the men's in this house.
Hey, the topic we were talking about before you guys got here, I know Matt maybe has something to contribute, because he used to play Evercrack.
We were just talking about that.
Funny, no, funny online gaming stories, and I already told the one about you telling people in Ragnarok you had SARS.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, speaking of which, Jamie just asked me if I'm paying to play.
They just... Okay, we just spent like a half hour talking about Ragnarok, so make it quick.
It's going to be quick.
For those, if there's anybody who's interested or is playing, they did today shut off the servers to get ready for pay-to-play.
It did just come back up.
And instead of being 12,000 people on the server with lots of lag, there's 2,400 people on the server with no lag.
We had an update from Aaron who says 3,800 people are logged into Chaos right now.
Loki's a little less people.
Damn, it's... There's less people on you, Loki.
Damn.
I have lots of people on me.
who was going to give away the armor said just kidding and ran off.
Oh, no.
That wasn't funny though.
One of the classes has the ability to warp people places.
Well, when people got wins that they were going to be going pay to play, like 50 or more percent of the people who played the beta didn't like that.
So they started warping people to places where they can't get out of it.
And they did that to me, the Christmas Village.
I had a fly wing too, but it took me 10 minutes to realize I had one.
And so they were sitting there, and I took screen captures, and I was like, I'm going to report you guys to Gravity, and you're going to get kicked off the server.
Fifteen minutes ago called, your topic arrived.
I'm just kidding.
You know what?
I just got here.
I'm just kidding.
I am go-good-not-this.
Matt, do you have any Evercrack stories that are funny?
No.
One more little thing.
Okay.
I freaking got warped to five different locations in a row, and they sent me to Glass Time.
I hate Glass Time.
I hate Glass Time.
Eat Electric Death.
Yes, greatest video game quote ever.
Alright.
Guess what, boys and girls?
It's time for the Orange Lounge Cage Match.
This is where I put a song in, and Loki puts a song in, and Jamie puts a song in, and they do battle.
They get naked and roll around and romp with each other.
and the winning song chosen by your votes in the chat room goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.
So, let's start it off with the reigning champion, Loki's pick.
Three weeks, actually only two shows victorious, but since we had no show the weekend of B3, it's been victorious for three weeks now.
So this is the last time it can win, and this will be the very first four-week rotated song, if this won.
So...
Here's a clip of Loki's song.
You want to introduce us?
This is Don Davis and Juno Reactor with Mona Lisa Overdrive from the Matrix Reloaded movie.
And since it is last week's winner, you only get to hear a clip.
Sorry, kids.
So here's a clip of Mona Lisa Overdrive.
Then there's a clip of last week's winner, Mona Lisa Overdrive.
Beautiful.
All right, the next entry tonight comes from Jamie.
Mine's going to annoy the hell out of Matt.
Okay, so tell us.
It's something Speed Mix.
Uh-oh.
Oh, God, it's a Speed Mix.
Well, tell us about it.
It's September.
It's old school stuff.
It's old school.
Who's it by?
I don't remember.
DJ Speedo with September, the Speedo Mix.
I think I got this one from JB.
Oh, God.
But I like the song anyway because I like the original song.
Alright, sounds good.
So this is Jamie's pick for this week.
And since it's a new entry, you get to hear the whole five minute long version.
Here it is.
DJ Speedo with September, the Speedo Mix.
Jamie's pick for the cage match this week.
Enjoy.
Remember, it's when it's the time.
Remember, love will change in your mind.
Remember, while I'm taking the sound away.
Our hearts are ringing, looking out for what we're saying.
At the dance of the night.
Remember, how the stars all night away.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura.com
DJ Speedo there with September.
That's DarkSakura's pick for the Sex-Tember.
I was about to leave the house, and I couldn't find a song.
So I picked September, because I like the song.
I like the original.
Uh-huh.
I like the speed mix okay, I give it an upper level 8, barely a 9.
Upper level 8, barely a 9 from Jamie.
Loki, I give it a 2 because it's a speed mix and I hate speed mixes and everything.
I hate speed mixes.
God damn it, it's not a new song, you just sped up the old one.
Stop it.
Um, I would give that song like, I don't know, okay, this is my problem with speed mixes.
DDR size, like a minute and a half, two minutes, they're awesome.
They're cool, they're fun, they're cheesy to dance to, they're great.
Five minutes long?
Joke's old.
So, if that were two minutes long, I'd give it like an eight.
But since it's five minutes long, I'm going to have it and give it a four.
But I do, I like the original too.
Yeah, the original was good.
I love the original.
I love the original, but no.
No.
All right.
Matt, the Ice Prince, or Ice Queen, whatever we're calling you We have the Rice Princess and the Ice Princess Yeah, Ice Princess works, I like that better than Ice Queen
I'm not that dramatic, bitch.
Anyway.
Yeah, no, I have to give that about a six.
I mean, Rob made a good point.
Five minutes is a little too long for a speed mix.
It just gets repetitive, so... Well, depends on how you're... Well, never mind.
Anyway.
Yeah, I give it a six.
The problem is it goes so fast that really you're listening to about 15 minutes worth of music in that little five minute, you know, spot, so... Loki makes a damn good point.
Listen up, everybody.
Irene, you have something to say?
Yeah, I agree.
I give it a 6 too, because I'm really burnt out on speed mixes, especially all the crap that you play on Orange Lounge.
Yeah, that you need to take off.
But yeah, 6, yeah, whatever.
Mr. Brad, there are only three good speed songs in this world.
Can't Stop Falling In Love, If You Were Here With Me Before The Beat, and the Aerosmith Jaded song.
If it's not that, it's not good, it's a 2.
No, it's a one.
What?
Yeah, there was a speed mix that won the cage match one time.
Yeah, it was heaven is a place on earth.
So, I think the general public would tend to disagree with you, Mr. Brad.
The general public doesn't matter.
Because they're all retards.
They don't play Ragnarok online.
Jamie knows what I'm talking about.
Anyway, can we get on to my pick now?
No, they don't need to play rock and roll.
My pick, my pick, my pick time.
My pick time, it's my pick time.
Fine, go, God.
Okay, who remembers, like, about three months ago when I put in a song by Kylie Minogue called Your Disco Needs You?
And everybody wanted to kill me?
Well, this is the Kylie song that people said I should have put in instead.
And this is, I'll admit it, it's a much better Kylie song, and if any Kylie song were to win the cage match, it should be this one.
And it's very cute, and it's very danceable, and it'll be great in a Pomadi game, and it's got a great video.
It's got a wonderful video to it.
But you can't see it, because it's radio.
Ha!
This is Kylie Minogue with Come Into My World.
I love this song.
This is my pick for this week's Big Red.
I love this song, and I hope you win.
Alright, here it is.
Enjoy.
All right, boys and girls.
Kylie Minogue with Come Into My World.
What did y'all think of that one?
Jamie's in the facilities right now, so we'll start with Irene.
Oh, I like Kylie.
That was a pretty good one.
I give it an 8.
I'd rather hear In Your Eyes, but that one's pretty good.
Maybe another time.
In another three months, I'll do In Your Eyes.
Yeah.
All right.
What are you giving us?
1 to 10?
8?
You're giving an 8?
An 8, yeah.
All right.
Whoever grabs the mic next.
Jamie.
Eight.
Brad.
I give it an eight, too, because I like the song a lot, but... I'm not a huge Kylie fan.
I know.
Fine.
Kill me.
Kick me out of here.
Be gone!
Just beat me up now!
Please!
Ice Queen.
Ice Slut, Ice Slut.
Well, no, that was only last night.
Oh, boy.
Anyway.
Anyway, if that was anything like the other song that you were playing, I was going to have to tell somebody to go get a rope so we could hang you by your freaking toes from the ceiling.
But, no, that was a good one.
I like that song a lot.
I give that a nine.
Excellent.
Loki.
Wow, you know, that sounded like every other fucking song that she sings.
Gee, um... Hmm...
Since I've heard it before, you know, I'm going to have to say that I'm going to give it a zero because it sucks ass.
And, no, actually, no, Kylie's alright, but that song sucks.
Seriously, she has done much better stuff than that song.
I actually have to decrease mine, okay, because last weekend when Maren and I had lunch in San Francisco, they played nothing but Kylie Minogue.
And then I was there the weekend before while all of you were at the tourney and I went to go get lunch.
and it was when Megumi-chan and I were having lunch and they were playing Kylie.
So I dropped my note 6.
Just out of bitterness.
I would like to retort Loki's argument and say that that song sounds nothing like I should be so lucky in love.
I should be so lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.
Come on.
It doesn't sound like the locomotion.
Anyway.
I give it a 10, it's fabulous.
Alright, here we go.
You can send your votes now.
Here's a quick recap of the songs in tonight's cage match.
Pick number one, last week's winner, three weeks winner, Mona Lisa Overdrive from the Matrix 2.
That's a shitty clip of the song, I'm gonna play a different clip.
Alright, pick number two, DJ Speedo with September And pick number three, Kylie Minogue, Come Into My World
Voting is now open.
You're going to send those over to private message to me.
I'm Sky in the chat room.
You say that again.
And you send those over private MSG.
No, no, wait.
What, Matt?
Come into my eye.
Oh, boy.
And if you want to send in your vote, you've got to get in our chat room.
Head on over to www.
Don't forget about our LiveJournal community
for those of you familiar with LiveJournal.
Put us on your friends list.
Yes.
Show the world you love Orange Lounge.
All right.
Ooh, my screen is filling up with votes for the cage match.
I'm going to have to go count those in a little bit.
In the meantime, what else do you kids want to talk about today?
Do we have a sim update for Loki?
Loki's been awfully quiet.
I think Kylie scared him.
So let's wake him up with a sim update.
You know, I want to know where my freaking Dancy Stage Party Edition stuff went.
It's like disappeared off my computer.
That's weird.
Anyway...
Um, there's a new, uh, CVS, um, update for Stepmania.
It was just updated yesterday, I believe.
Um, pretty nice.
I was playing with that earlier.
They've got a bunch of new modifiers they added in there, which is pretty cool.
And then they've also, um, done some other things.
They added a few things where you can adjust the pitch of the song.
Um, before it used to be limited just to .07, or .7.
Now you can go all the way down to .3, which makes the song sound...
Really bad, but if you really want to practice or something, that's pretty good for you And it loads really nice, so go check that one out And if you haven't checked out, there's a new DWI version, 2.49 or whatever But I don't play DWI because it's inferior, so go check that one out too Now as for other updates, let's see here
Um, check my money sims, because, uh, Uber, or, Utterdude, or whatever, that guy is releasing a lot of cool stuff, and pretty much all of his step files kick ass, and they're just really playable, so go play those.
Um, and, uh, other than that, I have the second most, um, DWIs on the internet, other than, uh, Shoei, which has, you know, 5,000, but I have 3,000 and something now, so, yay!
I would have 5,000 if I put every single one that he has in there, because I have all his, um...
I was telling Cage Match votes, I'm sorry.
Hello, show.
We're talking about money, go away.
What about money?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sniff Hello, we're trying to do a show here, what's up?
If you're going to say it, say it on the show, what's up?
What?
Shut up Bitch, please Your hair is sticking up Okay, Irene, what would you like for McDonald's?
I'd like a chicken sandwich and some fries Okay, so maybe I'll just get the meal, it's the fries and the drink and stuff I'll take your car, right?
Whatever's cheaper, yeah, you can take my car
Okay, I gotta go get cash back first.
Can you get me one of those Cheesecake McFlurries while you're out?
Hey, fuck you.
See, this is why I need things on the radio, because I need food from McDonald's too.
Our listeners really want to hear about the food we provide.
I think they do.
No.
Listeners, you care about what we're getting at McDonald's.
I say we have a vote.
What do you think we should get at McDonald's?
No, don't get them mixed up with the K-Med votes.
For a limited time only, they have the Strawberry Cheesecake McFlurries.
For a limited time.
For a limited time only.
That's okay, because I'm just going to go eat a sandwich at my house after the show.
You're going to go eat a sandwich?
Fine, I don't eat.
Okay.
So you're going to give me that McFlurry if I give you money?
The strawberry cheesecake one?
If they don't have the strawberry cheesecake one, you can get me an Oreo one.
Tee hee.
Boom shakalaka.
Thank you, Bradley.
You're my friend.
Okay, hi.
See, we already got a vote.
We got a vote for double quarter pounder with cheese meal.
That's a royale with cheese.
Is everybody leaving?
What are you getting frustrated about?
I'm missing step files and my programs just disappeared on my taskbar.
Damn it.
My, my.
Irene, are you guys going to do Orange Crush tonight?
Okay, that's something to look forward to in the next hour or so.
We'll do Mad Libs next week.
You want to do a list list tonight?
We haven't done one in forever.
We haven't done one in forever.
It's the first one of the house.
Let's do a list list when we get back, since there will only be four of us here, right?
I'm taking a nap.
What list list topic?
I'll think of one.
I will solicit ideas from the chat room.
We have no idea what to do on Listless tonight.
Top of cool anime in the world.
I'd have to research that.
Top of cool anime.
Haven't we done best anime before?
No, we never have.
How about worst Bomani game?
That'd be Marshall Beat.
There's probably not enough.
We could do worst video game.
Did we do worst video game?
Yes.
Let's see.
Hmm...
No, I'm not getting suggestions for our listless segment.
No.
G4 can kiss my balls, because I was watching this show on there.
But Rob, you might get SARS.
I know, I might.
I was watching this show on there today.
What was that, the 10 play or something like that?
Which one?
The 10 play.
What was that show, the 10 spot, 10 play?
Oh, yeah, Timplay, I think that's what it's called or something like that.
It's a top ten show.
Okay, and they were doing top ten most, like, changing video games of all time.
Like, video games that change the scene of all time.
Arcade games that change the scene of all time.
What?
Why is Pikachu humping Friendship Bear's arm?
I don't know.
Anyway.
Anyway, so they were doing, like, the top ten games that changed arcades.
And number one, of course, was Pac-Man.
Number 10, this was cool, was Final Furlong.
But number 8 was Dance Dance Revolution.
Oh, yay.
But fucking G4 TV, when they were talking about Dance Dance Revolution, guess what they showed a picture of?
What?
3D, uh, Easy to Dancer.
Easy to Dancer.
What stupid fucks they are.
They are stupid British.
Um, but actually they...
They had actually rounded up, um, they called, no, they said number whatever it was was Dance Dance Revolution, but they were actually talking about all the Bomani games, which is even worse.
Anyway.
This one's loud.
Um, okay, here's some suggestions from the chat room for tonight's list list.
Okay, uh, best Taka song.
No.
List of best ideas for a reality show.
No.
Worst Naoki song.

Eurobeat!
Dude, there's no one here to vote on anything.
They'll be here.
The chatroom votes.
Are they gonna... Eurobeat!
Yeah, they're gonna be... That's true.
Maybe we need to postpone this list for a little bit.
Play Drivin'.
What?
Play Drivin'.
Eurobeat?
What's Drivin' from?
Play Drivin'.
8th style?
No.
Drivin'.
From 8th style, right?
Yes.
It's not Drivin', it's Drivin'.
As in Drivin' in, of course, a Naoki song.
Alright, so we've done seven style songs.
Night Style Phones, I guess we'll do Eight Style Phones now.
So we're going to do, uh, Drive-In, if I have it.
I don't know if I have it.
I swear I do somewhere.
Oh, I got it, I got it.
I got it, na-na-na.
Okay, so we're going to take a quick break with some Eight Style Phones, and when we come back, we'll have Orange Crush, we'll do Listless at some point when the others get back, and our general clusterfuck of random topics.
So if you want to join our chatroom, head on over to www.uh,

Hello, boys and girls.
Hi, Lucy.
I'm going to throw that thing in the river.
Oh, you know what?
What?
Prison.
Prison!
Prison!
So that's why rent's cheap.
We're next to the dam, which is a big terrorist target, and we're right on the other side of the prison, so if there's ever a prison break... Next week's Orange Lounge will be hosted from my house.
And all future weeks.
It's fine.
Oh, they're saying in the chat room that the ferret, or now it's the coyote or whatever that thing is... Yeah, I like talking to the coyote.
It sounds like one of the animals from Happy Tree Friends.
And then they say it sounds like Menchie.
Menchie flavor.
Mmm.
Mmm, delicious.
So, wow, it's just the three of us here now.
Yes, it's quiet.
It's weird.
You should have been here this week.
Huh?
Martin Chung should have been here this week.
Less crowded.
Yeah.
Less chances to be claustrophobia-ed.
Or catch SARS.
Or catch SARS, yeah, because I still have it.
Remember brain tumor?
Yeah.
All at the same time?
Yeah, it's awful.
Do we want to talk shit about any of the other people that are on this show usually?
Well, you know what?
That Brad.
Oh, that Brad.
Congesting the server all by himself that I don't even play on.
He's so skinny.
Yeah, what's up with that?
And that ice queen.
What a fag.
And rice princess.
I haven't seen her eat rice in a year.
How dare she call herself that?
That reminds me.
I have to use our rice cooker.
You know what?
Huh?
Dare the shit and it's time to flush.
What was that?
I hate being sick.
God, let's give me good stars again.
Every time I laugh, I cough.
I'm going to beat that thing senseless.
Give it to me.
No.
No.
Oh, I know.
I thought of a fun thing we could do.
Since we were kind of making fun of G4 before the break, I thought maybe we could take a look at the list.
And this can be like an ongoing thing because there's a lot to talk about here.
We could talk about G4's list that they got together with the Entertainment Weekly.
I'll just shut up and let that thing talk.
I had to do the elementary school trick to make it work.
Don't do it!
Yeah, I gotta take that thing away.
You see this?
It's mine now.
This is mine now.
Alright.
They have an ass shot for the bad touch, that's sweet.
Is that the official background?
Yes, it is.
Do they have the background for Can't Get You Out of My Head?
I'm just curious what it looks like.
Oh, that's lame.
That's super lame.
I can't get the SARS out of my head.
Anyway.
Oh, yes.
Our topic at hand.
SARS.
We're going to talk about G4's list of the 100 greatest games of all time.
That they got together with Entertainment Weekly.
And we're going to make fun of it.
Oh, you're going to go blow your nose.
First off, if you happen to be watching G4 any time of the day, no matter what day, you're going to catch this goddamn show because they play it all the time.
All the time.
And they suck.
Alright, so now we're going to talk about the 100 greatest video games of all time, according to a bunch of schmoes.
DDR is on the list, I might add.
DDR is on the list, so if you don't know where it clocks in, listen to us, we'll tell you where it clocks in.
This is like a throne.
Here we go.
And you're sitting on it, don't you feel special?
Okay, so let's get everybody's thoughts and opinions on the top 100 games here.
100 on their list.
Missile Command.
Yay.
Missile Command was cool.
I have that on the 2600, 5200, a bunch of other things, Intellivision Yeah, there's no Scoobman 2000, I think Whatever that was Nice, please Sam, moving on, alright?
Number 98, Frogger.
A Konami game, yes?
Yeah.
It always makes me think of that episode of Seinfeld.
I'm not even that big a fan of Seinfeld, but I will never forget that episode of Seinfeld with the Frogger.
I don't think I've watched it.
It's the greatest... I've only seen one episode of Seinfeld, and it was the last one.
You know why I went?
Because it was at the Red Lion Convention Center by the mall, and they gave out free food.
That's so ghetto fabulous.
The only other episode, I remember three episodes of Seinfeld.
I remember the Gradius one.
I'm sorry, not Gradius.
I remember the Frogger one.
I remember the masturbation one, where they make the contest about who can go the longest without masturbating.
And then I remember the one where they go to a Chinese restaurant and they dare Elaine to steal an egg roll.
Anyway, yeah.
I remember the one where they all died.
Oh wait, I dreamed that.
Number ninety-seven.
Secret of Mana.
Why so low on the list?
It needs to be higher.
I know.
Fuck that.
At least it wasn't Secret of Evermore.
Question!
Keep going.
Now, what do you think about Second Densetsu 3?
Why didn't they ever release that here?
They're going to.
Are they?
When?
After they released the first Second Densetsu, which was released as Final Fantasy Adventure.
Is that what that Sword of Mana is that they're doing?
Sword of Mana is just Second Densetsu 3?
First one.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Number 96 on their list, M-U-L-E, which is a game a lot of people probably don't remember, but if you did ever play it, this game was a shit.
It was one of the first multiplayer games that was just downright innovative for its time.
It's well-deserved mention on the list.
You said downright.
Number 95, Golden Axe.
You know what's funny?
Golden Axe the Duel was the first game I played on the Saturn, and it was an important one.
You know what I remember about Golden Axe was the ending where it showed the people in the arcade and the heroes jumped out of the screen and trampled all the people in the arcade.
That was great.
That was the best part about Golden Axe was the ending.
Number 94 is a game I've never fucking heard of.
It's IL2 Stromovic.
Okay, whatever.
Whatever.
93, Joust.
Joust is like one of the games I play on Alter Pave all the time.
You know what?
They had the Nintendo version, which was Balloon Fight.
Remember Balloon Fight?
No.
We who play Animal Crossing should have Balloon Fight.
Yes, I know Balloon Fight.
I'm just being difficult.
92, Super Star Wars.
Huh, yeah.
You ever play it?
Yeah.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I don't think it should be on the top 100 of videos of all time.
Super Star Wars is great because of the debug mode.
You could, like, skip levels.
I didn't know there was a debug mode.
There is for all three of the Star Wars games on the Super Nintendo.
Well, I'll be damned.
I'll have to bring over my SNES one day.
Why?
So you can play all the games.
Can we play ActRaiser?
Yeah, I have it.
Because ActRaiser is, like, my favorite Super Nintendo game ever.
I wonder what's on this list.
I don't even know.
Keep going.
Keep going!
Bye, Hunter.
You know they're going to make a movie out of Spy Hunter?
That'd be kind of cool.
Yes, Loki.
And guess who's in it?
Who?
The Rock!
No shit.
God, it's going to be awful.
Well, did you ever play... I wish we could, like, spray oil on his limousine.
Did you ever play Spy Hunter, though, that was on the PS2?
That was pretty rad.
No, I never did.
It was pretty cool.
Uh, 90...
Crash Bandicoot 3 warped.
Gag!
I hate Crash Bandicoot.
It looks retarded.
I don't know if that's the Crash Bandicoot game I would have put it there.
I feel really ripped because I bought... What was that game?
It's Crash Bandicoot.
It's like Crash Bandicoot's answer to Mario Party.
What was it called?
Crash Party?
Crash Party.
It's awful.
I wish I would have just bought Mario Party.
I wanted Sonic Party.
Huh?
I wanted the Sonic Party game.
I have it.
Somewhere.
Is it okay?
It's okay.
It's kind of... I couldn't figure it out, but I'm lazy.
Okay.
I have no attention span whatsoever.
Uh, 89, Castle Wolfenstein.
Yeah.
Now, is that referring to the original on the Apple IIe?
I think not.
Is it referring to the original?
I watched this stupid thing.
It's the original one they're talking about, not Wolfenstein 3D.
Alright, fine.
So we have to make, uh, give a nod to the original.
I wouldn't put the original Wolfenstein above, like, M-U-L-E, but whatever.
No, it was all about playing Doom and going to the Wolfenstein level by warping there.
Sheesh.
Uh, number 88, FIFA Soccer 2003.
Whatever.
Whatever, we don't talk about sports on this show.
87 was Battlezone.
Battlezone was cool.
Remember the tank?
You don't remember Battlezone?
I didn't play Battlezone.
It was a vector game and you were in the tank?
Was it on the Vectrex?
I think it might have been.
Because I didn't play the Vectrex.
It was Atari.
It was Atari's game.
You know we've been looking for a Vectrex.
Really?
Yeah.
I wouldn't doubt it.
86.
Oh, it smells like fabric softener.
Oh, no wonder.
And thank God this game made the list.
86 was Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo.
Amen.
They're supposed to have... No, that was Gem Fighter.
Not Gem, but Pocket Fighter.
They have a second one out now.
When are they going to release a new version of Puzzle Fighter?
That's the game they need to take online.
Forget DDR.
You know what's awesome?
I have Puzzle Fighter, the one that's on the Dreamcast.
That was awesome because there's like a columns mode in it.
As well as another type of mode in there.
It's just like three different modes.
XYZ mode is awesome.
Plus it had the Sakura vocal song in it.
85, Prince of Persia.
God, I hate that game.
I know, Prince of Persia was so like... It's an ad for all over your old gaming magazines to this day.
Oh my god.
And how many freaking systems was that game on?
All of them.
All of them.
You could not... If you owned a game system of anything, you could get Prince of Persia.
84 was Asteroids.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Next!
83, Daytona USA.
Daytona!
I never even played that.
What do you love about Daytona, Loki?
It's fun, and a lot of the arcades, especially the ones like in Reno and stuff, they've got like 16 machines hooked together, so it's like one hell of a race.
Normally they're like huge lap settings, so you're like racing about 12 people and stuff.
I have nightmares, though, about that game for one reason.
I worked in an arcade where they never turned off the attract.
for that game.
All day I'm going, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
I'm like, oh God, make it stop.
You know, there was actually a really funny penny arcade to that.
I don't remember where exactly it was.
One of the older ones from a couple years ago.
I remember Gabe, but the other guy was sitting down at the computer and Gabe walks up and goes, do-do-do-do-do-do-daytona.
And the other guy reaches up and grabs out his heart.
He goes, ah!
Like that.
Oh my Lord.
82, Goulds and Ghosts.
Yes.
Freakin' Makai Mura.
81, Gauntlet.
Remember, don't shoot food.
Remember, don't shoot the hosts.
80, Silent Hill 2.
Hey, Yamaoka music.
Right on.
How far do we want to take this list?
Let's keep going.
Keep going?
Keep it rolling!
79, King's Quest.
Next.
King's Quest was awesome.
This should have been in the top ten.
I'm sorry, King's Quest should have been in the top ten.
It's one of the most innovative video games of all time.
Maniac Mansion better be on that list.
Maniac Mansion better be on that list.
Next.
I don't know if it is.
This freaking dolts.
But if there had been no King's Quest, there would have never been Maniac Mansion.
Whatever.
78, Defender.
Okay, next.
77, Saturn Bomberman.
Yes, oh my god, yes.
I love Saturn Bomberman and I could not find a copy.
Actually, you know what was really good?
The Bomberman games on the, um, on the, uh, TurboGrafx.
Bomberman 93, Bomberman 94.
Uh-huh.
Those were good.
Okay, we had a request in the chat room to just skip ahead to 50.
Okay.
You want me to read the rest of these really fast?
Yeah.
Okay, give your, Jamie, you're going to give your one word reaction to each of these games as I name them off, okay?
Okay.
Here we go, super fast forward here.
75, WaveRay64.
Next.
74, Robotron2084.
Next.
73, Driver.
72, Animal Crossing.
71, oh, I can't wait to hear this.
71, Busta Move 2.
Which one?
The one that's gonna piss you off.
It's fucking Puzzle Bobble, you bitches!
No, no, I'm almost positive.
Aren't they talking about... Oh, no, they are talking about Puzzle Bobble in that case.
Bitches.
Bitches.
But I have it on Saturn.
Loki, you saw it.
Were they talking about Puzzle Bobble or the other one?
What?
Forget it.
Forget it.
They're talking about Puzzle Bobble or Bust a Move 2.
Were they talking about Groove or what?
They're talking about Puzzle Bobble.
Bitches.
70, Homeworld.
Next.
69, Centipede.
Checkball.
68, Roller Coaster Tycoon.
Whatever.
67, Tennis 2002.
Whatever.
66, MechWarrior 2, 31st Century Combat.
Um, yeah.
65, Devil May Cry, 64, Samurai Showdown, 63, R-Type, 62, R-Type, fucking hard, but Dan can beat it on one credit, he's the man,
Yes, he is.
62, Max Payne.
Um, next.
61, Panzer Dragoon Saga.
No, Max Payne.
Annoying as fuck because of the baby level.
Wee!
Wee!
Okay.
61, Panzer Dragoon Saga.
Ah, godly.
60, Star Wars Jedi Knight Dark Forces 2.
Um, cool, next.
59, Baldur's Gate.
Um, whatever.
58, Virtua Fighter 4.
I hate Virtua Fighter.
57, Tempest.
56, Lemmings.
Gag.
I liked Lemmings, screw you.
55, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six.
54, NBA Jam.
Best basketball game ever, because of the big heads, and you can play as the Mortal Kombat guys on some of the machines.
Yes.
53, Mike Tyson's Punch Out.
Africa, Africa, Body Blow, Body Blow.
52, Wing Commander, 1 and 2.
51, Contra.
50, Pitfall.
Uh...
I like the speed way of doing it.
Let's do the speed thing all the way to 20.
Let's do the speed thing all the way to 20, okay?
Alright.
I can't wait for this one.
49, Pokemon.
48, Chrono Trigger.
Best game.
47, Tron.
He.
Wait, go back to 48, Chrono Trigger.
Why so fucking low?
That's a... That's fucking retard.
Don't.
Hey, that's not right.
47, Tron.
46, Unreal 45, Donkey Kong Hey, Banana 44, Age of Empires 2, The Age of Kings Whatever How does a game like that get above Chrono Trigger?
Because Retards made this list God And then this one, NHL 93 What the fuck ever At 43 42, Quake 2 Hey, Quake 2 has a Gachapon patch to it 41, Deus Ex Whatever
40, Dance Dance Revolution.
Yay!
Why so high?
39, beating out Dance Dance Revolution, Mortal Kombat 2.
Actually, I like Mortal Kombat.
Pertality.
I like Mortal Kombat 2 because I like playing on the beta kits where you can do the infinite juggles and float and start off your game against Shao Kahn.
Where the hell was I?
I was in high school.
38, Sonic the Hedgehog.
37, SimCity.
Okay.
36, Tom Clancy, Splinter Cell.
Whatever, I hate Tom Clancy games.
35, Battlefield 1942.
Whatever.
34, ooh, this is a good pick, Ultima 4, Quest of the Avatar.
Okay.
33, Duke Nukem 3D.
Your face, your ass, what's the difference?
32, Tekken 2.
Hey, Tekken 2 had June in it.
31, Diablo 2 30, Mario Kart 64 29, Medal of Honor, Allied Assault 28, Galaga 27, Monkey Island 2, Lee Chuck's Revenge 26, Command and Conquer, Red Alert 25, Star Wars X, Wing Alliance 24, Castlevania, Symphony of the Night Oh my god, yes
23, Metal Gear Solid 22, Resident Evil 21, EverQuest Now that the others are back, we can slow this down a little bit to really rant about the top 20.
So, I know Brad has a few things he wants to say about some of the ones he heard just coming in the door.
Brad?
What is this big thing?
This, by the way, is G4 Entertainment Weekly's list of top 100 games of all time.
Okay, I've read so many of these lists over the years, and I already know when they do these top 100 things, that they get really lazy, and they kind of just... Because you can't really concentrate on every little thing, so they just start splashing games here and there because they don't know where to put them.
My opinion about some of these games being at like 24, 25, whatever it was, Castlevania Symphony of the Night, you know, in my opinion, should be up there in the top 5 at least, but I haven't read what their other top 19 or 18 or 20 is, so I don't know.
Why they're thinking these are their games.
Do they have explanations for why these games should be in the top 20?
If you watch the show, but we're not endorsing that.
Good.
Okay.
Well, as I name off these top 20... Your solid should also be up in the top 5, but whatever.
As I name off these top 20, you can tell us if they were deserving, Brad.
You can be the critic on if they're deserving of being in the top 20.
Okay, Brad?
Where'd the ice queen go?
Oh, okay.
Okay.
All right, here we go.
Oh, I don't need a quarter.
Here we go, kids.
Number 20, Super Metroid.
Dude, God, yes.
Number 20, Super Metroid.
Definitely deserving of being in the top 20, but I don't know if it should be at the lowest of the top 20.
I don't know what the other games are, so... Excellent game, though.
Definitely should be in the top 20.
19, Ms.
Pac-Man.
What...
If you're talking of all time, come on, Ms.
Pac-Man, of all time.
No.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
Deserving of top 20.
Ms.
Pac-Man has so little gameplay comparing to something like Super Metroid.
It should be in the top 100, but maybe like at 99.
That's sad.
If you were 10 years older, you would not say that.
What the fuck?
I remember when it came out.
I know.
I'm saying, but if that was the game that everybody was playing in the arcades, like, now it's... It doesn't matter!
The game itself, as far as gameplay is concerned, that's the reason why we play video games, is because they're fun.
And Ms.
Pac-Man is not nearly as fun as something that has as much gameplay as Symphony of the Night, or Super Metroid.
I don't care if it's, oh, it brings you back to your past, or whatever, it's still not as fun.
I don't think it has anything to do with that.
If that's what it does to me, then you're playing video games for the wrong reason, in my opinion.
Yeah, but do you own a magazine?
I don't think so, so, huh!
And I will.
And it'll be very Nazi-ish.
No Ms.
Pac-Man for you.
I'd say it'd be Pac-Man.
Number... 18.
Soul Calibur.
Yes.
Soul Calibur, yes.
But you can't forget, though, Soul Edge.
Which is not on the list, I can tell you.
I think the reason why... I think the reason why they would put that up there as far as... Because Soul Calibur... They're probably talking about the console version.
It was kind of a...
It kind of pushed the fighting game on the console to, like, it pushed the envelope on it.
It gave you a lot more extra features.
It was kind of one of the first things, the big ones, to do that.
And Soul Edge was a great game on the console, but Soul Calibur really pushed it to the limit.
One thing to consider also, when they brought out Soul Calibur on the Dreamcast, the graphics were better than the arcade version.
Which is like, had never been done before.
Exactly, and that's probably one of the reasons why it's up there.
This is going to get an interesting reaction.
17, Tomb Raider.
Okay, I hate Tomb Raider, but it needs to be somewhere up on the list because it did start a new kind of genre.
I mean, there were other games kind of like it, but it was the one that kind of got accepted for...
starting this new genre again.
The big-breasted action hero!
Exactly!
Matt knows what I'm talking about.
No, I think... I want Stripperella the game.
Hold on, hold on.
As silly as Matt's kind of being joking, it's kind of true.
A big-breasted, like a female who kicked ass in a video game and became like an icon, basically like the logo for the PlayStation for a while was Laura Croft.
I mean, I hate the game, but...
It did do something huge to... And that probably sounds hypocritical because I said it like Ms.
Pac-Man.
Because it's not fun.
That was actually what I was going to say because... And I preempted it.
Because Ms.
Pac-Man... Well, actually, not Ms.
Pac-Man so much as Pac-Man.
In the sense of Tomb Raider 2, you could blow her up and throw her off the balcony and make her break her neck.
Yeah, yeah.
Here's another thing.
In this Pac-Man, you can't swan dive off a 30-story cliff and kill yourself, but you can do that in Tomb Raider, and that's what makes Tomb Raider fun.
You can see her with her broken neck.
Alright.
Moving on.
16, Halo.
I haven't played it, so I guess I'm not a true gamer.
15, and this... Halo is freaking gorgeous, and actually, I can probably say that, yeah, it should be up there.
You've played a few FPSs, I believe.
First Person Shooters, right?
Hold on.
Jamie, I need to get something.
I think you've played quite a few First Person Shooters before, right?
So you know the difference.
I've never played Halo, so what's so great about Halo that makes it different than other First Person Shooters?
It's just really interactive, very responsive, and you've got so many different levels you can play on, and you can play it in different ways.
Plus, when you play multiplayer, you can play cooperatively with another person.
instead of having, excuse me, Deathmatch.
I'm, like, burping up.
All right.
Anyway, but on top of that, it's really pretty.
I mean, really pretty.
And it really shows what the Xbox can do, honestly.
And for me, even though Xbox isn't my favorite system, I'd have to say that, yeah, that has to be up there.
And by the way, if Steel Battalion is not on the list, I'm going to scream.
It's not.
Okay, moving on to number 15.
And this is a game...
I think should be in the top three, but it's not, but whatever.
15, Civilization 2.
What, um, yeah.
The greatest strategy game on the computer of all time.
Period.
No, Matt's saying Get a Rope.
Um, Civilization 2 may not be my type of game, but I've seen, I like Civilization 1.
I guess I wasn't as much into strategy games as I am, like adventure stuff.
But I could see how it's so good, because I did like Civilization 1 for a while.
Then it started to grate on me or whatever.
But, I don't know, Sid Meier, I mean, he's just, I guess he's a genius when it comes to making strategy games, simulation games and stuff, so.
I think also, Civilization can kind of be seen, this is the way I look at it, it's strategy games for dummies.
It's a very accessible kind of game.
Like, you don't really have to be into strategy games to play them.
Well, that's what I'm saying.
Sid Meier kind of makes his games kind of user-friendly, even though they have a lot of strategy involved.
You can get into it even if you're kind of... I mean, like the Sims.
It can get pretty complicated, but... It's pretty actually... It shows you how to play pretty easily.
Alright, moving on.
Fourteen.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.
Yep, I'd have to say so.
Changed the face of skateboard games forever.
I mean, skateboard games... What other... Skate or die.
Skate or die should be above... Hold on, Tony Hawk's.
Hold on.
In my opinion, or 720. 720.
Menace Beach, 720, 720, hey that's cool, um, no, TNC Surf Designs, um, no, but seriously, to me there basically are only two skateboard games, Tony Hawk Bros.
Skater and Skater Die, so, that goes to show you how good Tony Hawk is.
Come on, 720, what other game do you get chased by bees?
Again, didn't that happen in Paperboy?
Shut up.
No, Paperboy's not on the list.
God, Paperboy's not on the list, or Crystal Castles?
Nope.
Marble Madness?
Nope.
Those retards.
Okay, here we go.
13, Gran Turismo.
Again, changed totally the course of racing games.
And all the, not just realistic driving engine, but like, such a design, you know, aspect, like fine-tuning your cars and everything, it being like the main reason to even play the game.
They just changed the direction.
Alright, now, number 12, and when I say this game, I need to make a footnote here.
Basically what they did, I noticed on the G4 Entertainment Weekly list, is they kind of took series, and then kind of looped them all together into one position on the list, and then kind of, this list that I'm looking at kind of highlights one game.
So you see what I'm saying?
Even though I'm saying one game in the series, it means the whole series, basically.
You see what I'm saying?
Make sense?
Okay, with that being said, number 12 is Final Fantasy 7.
Okay.
But that was to mean the whole Final Fantasy series.
If they meant the whole series, if they truly meant that, that's forgivable.
But I think they said Final Fantasy VII probably because more people know about Final Fantasy VII than any other Final Fantasy, because it really changed.
One thing about Final Fantasy VII is that it brought it into, I guess, the modern age of games.
Right, and it was mostly... Although I have to say, though, that
It was... Now that I've gone back to play it again, I'm still hoping that they... The rumor proves out true and that they do an updated version.
Because it would really benefit from it.
Sorry, we can't hear Ice Queen because he has no mic.
Matt is saying what?
Oh, crap.
The mic's stuck in the... Okay.
What were you saying, Matt?
What I was saying for anybody that cares was that Final Fantasy VII was...
Really, really good just because of the fact that it revolutionized the eye candy for Final Fantasy.
It was the first eye candy.
It doesn't look very good now, but for its time it looked really, really good.
And it had really good backgrounds, yeah.
The thing, the people that are like, kind of like gaming purists would, or Final Fantasy 6 purists or whatever would say is that that's a bad thing that it revolutionized the eye candy thing because Squaresoft for a while started going only for the cinematics and the eye candy for a while.
and they just forgot about gameplay when it comes to, like, Final Fantasy VIII.
That's my opinion.
VIII wasn't actually that bad.
Exactly.
Jamie says X was good.
I think they kind of went back to mixing the gameplay with the cinematics.
But wait, what were we... There was something I was going to say.
Do you want me to... Can I elaborate on the Final Fantasy VII remake thing?
Keep going, yeah.
Okay.
Jamie was saying she really hopes the rumor about Final Fantasy VII remake on PS2 is true.
they did an interview with us well actually Squaresoft posted something to the users about we've started to make sequels to Final Fantasy with Final Fantasy X-2 coming out which other games would you like there to be sequels to?
overwhelmingly people said Final Fantasy 7 Squaresoft rebuttaled by saying we don't have the time or effort to remake the engine for Final Fantasy 7 of course everybody said use X2's engine we use whatever now so if that's true that they don't have the time money or effort to make it
They're not going to be able to remake Final Fantasy 7.
But there was a rumor, and it was confirmed that eventually they were going to remake Final Fantasy 7.
So, I don't know.
Squirtle's got their head up their asses now, so who knows.
Alright.
Moving on to the list, and I'll just say it.
Number 11 is GoldenEye 007.
That game was actually pretty good, but that game actually did make me throw up.
I...
I don't care if it's the best Nintendo 64 game ever made, it's undeserving of being in the top 20, in my opinion.
The way it got up there is because if it wasn't for that game, Halo wouldn't be around, because it did make first-person shooters on the console a popular thing, especially multiplayer first-person shooters on the console.
Before, all there was, you had to have a computer and a LAN, you know, to play...
multiplayer shooters.
And then all of a sudden here comes Nintendo 64 with their only good game besides Zelda.
What about Faceball 2000?
Faceball?
That was all over then.
Yeah, but it was a multiplayer game.
Have a nice day.
Sadly enough, I played through the whole game of that.
I weep for you.
Speaking though, you know what I wish they had done?
I wish that they had actually done the Satellaview games in the States.
The Satellaview games.
If you look on the bottom of your ship for Nintendo, there's this thing that will pull out.
That's where a modem was supposed to go.
Why isn't North and South on that list?
Yes, they should have done the modem thing.
Because they had the best version of Zelda on that.
Alright, moving on.
I'm going to try to kind of jam through this list because we have some other segments left we've got to do.
Number 10 was Street Fighter 2.
Yes, next.
Brad, hey.
Street Fighter 2, number 10.
Street Fighter 2 started my first fangirl crush, other than Jed Nelson.
Street Fighter 2 is what got me into... It was Ryu.
Hello.
Street Fighter 2 is what got me into arcades.
Okay.
Street Fighter 2 is a great game.
I love it.
I always will.
But it kind of is, to me, kind of like the Ms.
Pac-Man thing I said.
It started a new type of game.
A lot of people say that Street Fighter 2 is the...
The Pong?
The Pong?
but it is deserving of being on that list so it's one of those things where it's kind of more of a nod to the genre like Ms.
Pac-Man was like there would be no Maze Game without but in that case they should have put Pac-Man not Ms.
Pac-Man but whatever yeah so I agree that it should be near the top of the list but oh Loki thinks Loki thinks they put Ms.
Pac-Man on the list because it got girls to play games well that's what they said in the goddamn show whatever well the whole thing about Street Fighter Street Fighter 2 is that
It was so widely popular, but it really blew the doors open.
And the thing is, when I actually bought my own Super Nintendo, the first game I got was Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo.
That was my game.
And I was such a Ryu fan girl, and I still am.
I used E-Honda because he was fat like me.
Okay.
Number nine.
StarCraft and WarCraft.
Whatever.
Whatever.
If I have to play another RTS game, I will put a gun to my head and pull the trigger.
I don't like real-time strategy games.
And they did not... How could you say Starcraft and Warcraft are different games?
I think they should be in the top 20, but not above Civilization.
Oh, hell no.
Dude, fucking Red Alert.
That game rocks.
I love Command & Conquer.
No, no, no.
Command & Conquer Ghost will be a lot better, but that's a first-person shooter.
Moving on.
The only red alert that's cool is the Transformer.
Number eight.
Another series.
Super Mario 64.
That was actually very fun.
Dan and I, when I first moved in with Dan, we would just spend hours all night playing Mario 64.
Like trying to do the special jump to get to the roof.
I agree definitely with putting Mario in the top ten.
I actually think it ought to be higher.
But I don't agree with the game they highlighted.
And it started at Mario Sunshine.
We wouldn't have Mario Sunshine without it.
I agree, but I think Mario Bros.
3 is the one they should have kind of picked to lead the pack.
I think that was the best Mario game they made.
See, I feel like Mario World better than Mario 3.
Hold on, hold on.
Hold on.
Yes, Matt's saying Super Mario 64 and Sunshine are different.
Okay, here's why Jamie...
made the comparison.
Because Super Mario, as in Super Mario on Nintendo, is an original platform side-scorer game, whereas Mario 64 is a 3D platformer, and it plays differently.
The idea is similar, but it plays completely differently, because it's in a 3D realm.
And because of Mario 64, we have games like Monkey... What's it called?
That PlayStation game?
Super Monkey Ball.
Ape Escape.
Oh.
Ape Escape.
Another 3D platformer game.
It's like Jak and Daxter, I think, and...
Like these games that are pretty popular, I hear.
Spyro.
Spyro, I didn't really like Spyro, but it is popular.
Everyone always forgets about what Mario is missing.
Because that game sucks ass!
Do you know what that is?
It's Nintendo's version of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego, and it's a bad interpretation of it.
Alright, we gotta move on with this list.
I hate to say it, but if we don't get through this list, we're not going to be able to get the FUs of the week.
Oh my god, no way out.
Okay, I know, we haven't even done the FUs of the week yet.
So, number seven.
This is, I want to see Brad's reaction to this.
Number seven, The Sims.
Number seven?
And I actually agree with this.
I agree with it because it's the top selling computer game of all time.
Period.
Period.
and it's accessible to everybody.
It's a video game that has no limits, literally.
I mean, boys, girls, men, women, children, everybody can play this game and it's very accessible and everybody has fun with it.
The only problem with The Sims is that it has no goal.
There's no objective.
But in a way...
That's kind of the appeal of it.
It kind of made way for games like Animal Crossing.
Isn't that all Sid Meier's games?
They have no goal.
Not even Civilization has a goal.
Sid Meier did not do The Sims, if I'm not mistaken.
Are you serious?
Let me elaborate on that.
They actually, the PC versions have no goal.
Overall, your goal, obviously, is to be successful and whatever.
But in the console versions, they do have goal-oriented things in there.
because obviously you're limited to what you can hold on the console and stuff.
Did you say my name?
All right.
Here we go.
Number six, Half-Life.
Any comments?
Okay, I played Half-Life.
Hold on, Matt's saying Half-Life isn't that good.
Half-Life kind of changed first-person shooters.
After Half-Life,
These games started coming out kind of like, I think System Shock 2 and stuff came out after Half-Life.
I can't remember.
Somebody could probably call me on that.
And they started becoming more story-oriented.
You know, you had to think more instead of just straight on look and shoot, kill things.
You had to kind of more think in a problem-solving way.
You know, I don't know if I would put it that high on the list.
I think it's way too high on the list.
Especially considering the number of other FPSs they have on the list.
Because there's another one still on the list that we haven't gotten to yet.
Oh, great.
Number five.
This is an interesting choice.
I suppose you have to have a sports game somewhere in the top ten.
Matt in 2003.
I'm sorry.
Super high impact football is better.
We're spending way much time on this game.
Go to the next one.
None of us play sports games.
Give me a fucking break.
Tecmo Bowl.
Enough said.
No, no.
Tecmo Bowl and super high impact.
NBA Jam, I think it's the only one I even put 10 seconds on, and that was it.
Blitz was actually kind of funny.
Blitz was kind of funny.
Super Tennis on Super Nintendo, I did play that.
Alright, moving on.
Here we go.
Getting down to the wire.
Number 4, Grand Theft Auto 3.
Yeah, that has to be on there.
It was pretty unique.
It's again the series highlighted by one game.
And Vice City is just 3's engine, isn't it?
Vice City is a little bit different, the engine.
They upgraded the graphics a bit, and they changed... I don't know, I guess it is the same engine, maybe they just... I don't know.
Unlimited some things in the graphics.
Alright.
Number 3, Tetris.
I almost think it ought to be number 1.
I'll say it.
I'll say it.
I'm going to leave now.
Goodbye.
That's so weird.
Without that, we wouldn't have Tetranet.
I ran something to contribute.
Yes.
I kind of think that's why Mrs. Pac-Man was so high on the list, because it has kind of the same appeal as Tetris, where you could play it over and over and over, and it's different every time.
You don't have to worry about graphics or anything like that.
It's something you can take with you to work and play.
You don't have to immerse yourself into a story or anything.
It's just pick up and go.
It's the same as Tetris.
Also, if I'm not mistaken, out of the 100 games on this list, this is one of only two puzzle games on the whole list.
Puzzle Fighter 2.
But how many puzzle games did Tetris influence?
Columns.
What was the one I'm thinking of?
Besides Puzzle Fighter, there was...
But I'm not really disappointed with what they did put as number one, so number three is fair.
Magical drop.
Magical drop.
Alright.
Moving on.
Number two.
I promised there'd be another FPS on here before we got to the end.
Doom.
Yes.
Because I would come home from school, I would go back to Marcy's house, and we would play Doom all night.
And go to the Wolfenstein level.
I think because this game is here, Half-Life should not be on this list at all.
Yeah.
Well, Half-Life is... And I question Halo's presence.
Half-Life puts more of a story into it.
Yeah, Matt's saying Half-Life puts more of a story into it, and I think that's why they put it there.
But that does make you question Halo being there.
Halo's the most successful Xbox game.
Halo is the most successful Xbox game, is what Matt says.
Matt Loki, Matt.
Hold on.
Here's the thing.
I see what they're doing here on this list.
They're going by genre.
It's like they're cycling through genre games and which ones are the best in the genre.
We might as well have just a top 20 games in each genre.
That would have been more of a better idea, but whatever.
Number one, and obviously somebody can guess this because it hasn't been named yet.
Let Irene.
And it is... Drumroll please.
A Boy and His Bob!
That's my choice, but it's The Legend of Zelda.
Can you guess which game in the series they chose to highlight?
The original.
Nope.
Link to the Past.
Really?
Link to the Past.
Oh, I thought you told me the original.
Nope.
I just heard you tell me the original.
I totally guessed it.
And I'm okay with Tetris not being number one because Zelda's, you know, God.
Link to the Past was the best of the series.
And I agree.
Link to the Past was the best of the series.
Period.
I think it's better than Ocarina of Time even.
And I think... Give Ice Queen a mic, please.
I'd have to say that Ocarina of Time was about equal to A Link to the Past, but this new freaking Zelda that's out, compared to these other two, sucks ass.
It's good in its own way, but not as a Zelda.
Yes, I did.
It's good in its own way, it's got a good story, but you're a freaking treasure hunter the whole freaking game.
You're a goddamn treasure hunter.
I'm sorry, but that is not Zelda.
I think I probably had the most fun out of all the Zeldas.
Probably playing the...
Oracle Games on Game Boy.
No, no, I'm sad about the whole, you know, the way they did this, Legends, all the, imagine, you know, Legends all linked to the past storyline with the graphics of Wind Waker.
That's what I was imagining that I wanted, you know, out of this game.
Well, there's still time for them to change, you know, make a new one that's like that.
They were going in kind of a different direction as the way the gameplay flows and everything in this one.
They wanted to go for more of a, like an anime style drama type
And I really, really like this one, and it probably is my favorite of the... It is my favorite of, like, the 3D Zeldas, but... Different type of game, in my opinion.
The biggest problem, and this isn't gonna be a spoiler, it might be a little bit, but the biggest problem is the fact that there are so few dungeons.
That's the thing that killed this Zelda for me.
There's... There's no dungeons!
Yeah, that's great, but I spent, like, three hours in one of the dungeons once, so I don't care if there's four, five, six dungeons.
I mean...
That was a long time to spend in one dungeon.
You know what, though?
In Ocarina of Time, if you don't know what you're doing, you could easily spend three or four hours in a dungeon.
And you had all of those that, well, yeah, the water one especially, but because of that freaking tricky little... I can see that a little bit, because I get really aggravated by those fucking caves in PSO.
My God, you spend like five hours in those freaking caves.
It's like, chains of scenery, please.
Oh, Phantasy Star Online?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Bionic Commando Blaster Master
No mention of the Mega Man series at all in the top 100.
That's my only beef.
No Mega Mans anywhere in the top 100.
What is up with that?
Actraiser was not on the list.
Chrono Trigger being so low was another one of my bitches.
Yeah, that's sad.
Was Boy This Bomb on there?
No.
What?
Killed it now.
And we could Ragnarok online.
Why was that not on there?
Dance Dance Revolution was 40.
Really?
Wow.
Dance Dance Revolution was higher than Chrono Trigger.
That's a travesty.
I'm never going to watch G4.
I'm going to bomb them.
Phantasy Star was on the list, actually.
Somebody's bitching about Phantasy Star.
Phantasy Star was... I might have skipped over it.
It was in the beginning.
Sorry, kids.
It was 76.
What the hell kind of crack addict loser printed up that list?
They put Chrono Trigger underneath the money?
G4 TV and Entertainment Weekly.
You can address those card readers.
You people from those companies, you're losers.
You don't know what the hell you're talking about, and you should try playing video games.
Hold on, Entertainment Weekly?
They don't even know what a video game is, so why are they doing a list like this?
It's why they partnered with G4.
But G4 doesn't even know what a video game is, apparently, you know?
The whole entire Puyo Puyo series.
I mean, I understand putting Tetris on there, but Puyo Puyo played so differently.
I mean, I played, you know, Kirby's Avalanche, and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, and where was Sonic Adventure? !
and even Sonic was lower than it should have been.
Very, very good mention.
Multiple people in the chat room are saying this, Earthbound.
It should have been a mention.
I can see why it would not be in the top 50.
Because nobody knows about it.
I disagree.
It's one of the hugest cult video games out there.
But it's a cult video game.
Twisted Metal 2.
They were obviously going for games that people know about.
And I never even heard about EarthBound until I met you.
I think the fact that it's one of the biggest cult games of all time ought to put it on there.
What about Final Fantasy Mystic Quest?
And people will know EarthBound soon because it's coming out on Game Boy Advance.
All right.
Yep.
Oh, another excellent mention.
Illusion of Gaia and that whole series.
Nowhere.
Soul Blazer.
Soul Blazer was not mentioned.
You know what?
Smash Brothers wasn't on there.
Nope, wasn't.
Guardian Legend.
Guardian Legend.
Yeah, my game is not on the list.
Damn those people.
Let's not get dank and run over G4.
We're going to give you guys some time to foam and get pissy over the top 100 list.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Yes.
Yes.
Do you want to hear my opinion about what game should have been number one?
What?
No, you don't, but I'm going to say anyway.
What?
Civilian Knight, of course.
Alright.
The Japanese version with the better voice acting.
The Saturn version.
We're running a little low on time, so I'm going to kick us over to break.
Okay.
So, we've done 7th style music, 8th style music, and 9th style music, so let's do some 6th style music.
Did we ever announce a cage match winner?
No, we didn't.
You want to announce a cage match winner?
Fucking Matt.
Yeah, it's Mona Lisa Overdrive again.
Hooray!
Yeah, but you can't win again.
First time... Shut up!
First time a song has been in for four weeks.
And by the way, another landslide vote for that one.
So, uh, good job for Mona Lisa Overdrive.
Kylie... Alright.
So, Mona Lisa Overdrive wins KTMG again.
Okay, so we're going to do some stick style songs.
And when we come back... Jamie, is there a stick style song you want to hear?
Um...
Similar to my mind, right?
Sure.
It's depressing.
It's goth.
And we're just going to do two six-style songs.
We need to come back and do the FUs of the week because we haven't done those yet.
Surprise, surprise.
So hurry up and send those to me over private message in the chat room.
My name is Sky.
We've got to keep it short this week.
Please keep your FUs of the week short, chat room.
All right, we'll be back in a little bit.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura.com
Thanks for watching!
Orange Lounge Radio.
We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
Hi, kids.
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
and gosh, it's awfully late in the show to start this, but you know, that list was just so much fun.
What can we say?
It's time for the FUs of the Week.
Jamie, what are the FUs of the Week all about?
We get pissy and tell stuff off.
All right, so here we go.
It's time to start the FUs of the Week.
Ooh.
Every time I listen to this, I still get, like, happy.
Cheers.
Um, the fact is that it goes toward idiot drivers who nearly run over me.
It goes toward the entire parking lot at Arden Fair Mall, because I nearly got hit a bunch of times.
And then, you know, it also goes toward me, you know, just being nervous in general.
And then it goes toward being exhausted and not being able to sleep.
And then it goes toward the person on Ragnarok Online who kept casting the ice spell and blocking all the paths and lagging me.
So, other than that, I'm not really all that angsty.
I'm very happy because I'm going to have a new live journal.
A pretty new live journal layout.
It is very pretty, I've seen it.
And it's very Transformery.
And I know another one.
Another fuck you goes toward all of those dubbed Headmasters episodes.
When I'm trying to find Japanese episodes, or, you know, raw ones, or ones that are subtitled, and instead I'm finding either the crappy three episodes they did in the States, which I already own, or...
Like, those bad dubs that they did.
Horrible dubs of Headmasters.
It's Transformers.
So, that pisses me off.
And another one goes toward me not being able to find another Hot Rod so I can have it at work.
And that's it.
Alright.
Loki.
Okay, um... F you to, uh...
Oh, I guess I should have done something other than just pat him in, you know, bubble wrap and write fragile, mm-hmm.
So I can't get my money back from her, but I'm going to give her one hell of a negative feedback on eBay.
But yeah, that wasted $15, plus the fact that I was overdrawn twice, so my bank charged me $60 for those records.
So that was a loss of $75 total for $15 for the records.
Yeah, at least my Eddie Murphy record works.
I had to bend it back.
Yeah, so that's the one I wanted anyways.
And then finally, in world news, FB to the dumb, uh, I don't know what nationality you are, but Middle Eastern bitch that's bitching in Florida about the fact that you have to remove your veil to take a driver's license photo.
Listen, bitch, you look like a fucking ninja.
You need to, like, take the damn veil off or just quit driving.
I better, yeah, why don't you just deport your ass over to, you know, the Middle East where you belong.
So, uh, yeah, sorry, I don't, I wanted to sound like some kind of, like,
I just have three words, four words Separation of church and state
I'm done.
That's all I had.
I don't know what you meant by that, but okay.
My FU of the week goes to my SARS, my never-ending case of SARS, and my brain tumor.
Fuck you, Irene.
My other FU goes to Irene.
And my next FU goes to the fact that I had, what, something like five, six drinks, and I was drunk for maybe like two minutes.
At the most.
Sucked.
It may have seemed like two minutes to you, but I remember you and like Matt and Irene freaking jumping around being all silly.
It was probably more like an hour.
Yeah, Irene like tripped.
She says she tripped, but it looks to me like she just did a Superman fly dive thing towards the emergency exit.
It was really interesting.
Alright, let's move on to other folks in the room's FUs of the week.
Uh, Brad?
FU goes to this segment because I really don't like it.
Irene.
FUs of the week.
My FUs to weird toe guys that are like frickin' scary.
that come to help you at like 3 o'clock in the morning and just say, yeah, doesn't anybody ever sleep in this town?
Fuck you, dude.
That's part of my view I totally forgot about.
I was driving home from, after dropping Rob and Matt off at their place, at Rob's place, I was driving around and my tire went flat and my CV half shaft in the front right of my car blew out.
So that's a couple hundred dollars of a...
Fuck you do automobiles, shitty ones made in America or Japan or Korea or German or whatever, I don't care Yugoslavia, it doesn't matter, all cars suck in some way or another Play my music There Okay, I can't hear it, but anyway My allergies, fuck them Because now my chest hurts and I feel like I have SARS
And I actually feel sick, is the thing.
I feel sick.
And, like, fuck not having access to my PTO until another two months.
Because I would so just stay home and, like, cough up all my lungs and then feel better.
I have insurance.
My insurance kicked in today.
Okay.
I can't.
Uh, is that it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Ice Queen?
Anything?
Anything?
First, fuck you, go see you for not getting my name right, bitch.
It's Ice Princess.
Thank you very much.
The Ice Princess.
And I'm only an instant slut when I have alcohol, so there.
And yeah, fuck you, my allergies too, and the fact that Claritin is like frickin' $12 for 10 pills.
It works really well, but it's $12 for 10 tablets.
It's overpriced.
It works well, it's overpriced, and it makes me really dehydrated.
Alright, let's move on to the chatroom FUs.
Leadfoot would like to say F you to G4 and their list.
Me love you long time!
StaplerX would like to say an F you to not having cash for Ragnarok Online and one for his friend.
F you to G4 for that godawful list.
RYC3 would like to say F you to G4.

23rd Magus, FU having to do three term papers over the weekend because the syllabus for that class was lost.
As I type this, I'm printing out the very last one.
FU to having nothing at Skrull for next week, but sit and sit for wait for graduation.
This is Skrull.
You should play that.
Yes, that's what he calls Skrull.
FU to Skrull in general.
After 12 years, they're letting me out on parole.
We.
And FU to G4.
Star Tetsuya would like to say F you to Sky for getting me re-addicted to NES emulators.
You're welcome.
The AZHP would like to say F you to... Star Fox was not on the list.
It was not, you're correct.
Damn them.
Okay, sorry.
God, FG4.
F you to UPS4 for losing DCB's PS2 and F you to G4 or whatever for not putting Tetris Attack on the list.
Yeah, Tetris might have counted Tetris Attack.
We'll never know.
VXJasonXV would like to say a big F you to bandwidth whores.
Me too.
No, you're just a whore in general.
Irene was talking about you, Rob.
Shut up.
Angel would like to give an F you to obnoxious, egotistical, seniority-slinging co-workers who get paid for nothing else than to boss people around and make them feel like shit.
Yeah, me too.
There's not question mark.
That was a typo.
Oops.
Quit your job, it feels really, really, really good.
I promise.
I tell you, you're out of money.
Justin would like to say F you to myself because I got into Ragnarok just as the servers came back, but I DC'd and tried to reconnect and it didn't let me.
Oh well, I will have it by Wednesday.
I will be there soon, Jamie.
And Sky, play this song, The Window.
People need to be scared.
I have no time.
Also, F you to me puking nine times on Wednesday.
F you to my sickness.
You have SARS.
Ha ha.
That's it for the F yous.
Yay!
Hooray!
I've got something to talk about.
Yes, Loki.
Once again, and you only have three hours left, you will go instantly, right now, not waiting one second, and go vote for The Legend of Trance on Bomani style, and you will vote a ten, and you will like it.
That is all.
And that would be the remix contest, yet?
Yes, you want them to vote The Legend of Trance and Dark Black Forest, both tens.
That is correct.
Where are you?
Yeah, what are you ranked right now?
I think I'm like fifth.
Unacceptable.
I still get a CD.
Also, other things that you can do, you can vote our station of five in your Live365 player window, because we love the ratings.
And you can also pour out our listening hours by listening to us all day long.
La la, la la.
All right, so let's do the Orange Crush thingy.
Okay, I'm unfolding my paper.
Now it's time for Orange Crush.
It's time to ask questions during Orange Crush.
Yay!
I love the theme song.
It's cool.
Okay.
Wait.
Everyone's leaving.
Everyone's leaving.
What?
They're like, I don't want to do Orange Crush.
It sucks.
Wait, where's... Hello, we need contestants.
Yeah, he's back, he's back.
Okay, here he is.
Okay, so the theme of this one is foreplay.
Hee hee hee.
and these are questions.
Irene's favorite.
Yeah, these are questions about Osamu Kubota.
All right.
Yeah, and then Matt's like, oh, fuck, I'm screwed.
But, okay, so does anyone have a timer for 30 seconds?
I do.
I'll time it.
Okay, super.
Here we go.
Okay, so we'll, huh?
Yeah, turn it down.
Yeah.
Oh, here, I'll turn it down.
Yeah.
Okay, so.
No, you're fine.
We're fine.
I just turned off the in-studio sound completely.
Okay.
Okay.
Here, I'll give a mic to Matt.
Here we go.
Okay, in three, two, one.
You ready?
Yeah, go.
Okay.
What year was Osamu Kubota born?
I don't care.
Let's see.
1963.
Okay.
What's his blood type?
A positive.
Okay.
What tax song was Osamu Kubota consulted on?
Consulted on?
Yeah, that he helped with.
.59.
I don't know.
Okay.
What are his... Whatever.
I don't give a fuck.
What are his two main hobbies?
His two main hobbies...
Playing games and killing people.
I don't know.
Okay.
You got none of... Okay, yeah, that's right.
Okay.
Alright, so how many did Matt get?
Yeah, he got none of them right.
Oh, Matt got none of them right.
Okay.
So, then we're ready to bring in Jamie.
Yeah, but she's going potty right now.
Is Jamie ready?
I think that's a no.
Uh-oh.
Let's do some more Orange Crush It's time to crush the Orange Crush
We're in an intermission right now because we're waiting for contestant number two.
Let me ask, do people like Orange Crush?
Is this going to be a regular segment?
Are the people in the chatroom digging it?
Because I've got a lot of material.
I think they like it.
They like you, Irene.
They really like you.
Aw, thanks.
You love me.
You really love me.
Hand the mic over to Brad.
He has an idea and I'm scared, but
It looks like with the nature of these questions and stuff, and obviously the lack of knowledge that our contestants have on these questions, we might should be able to change the length of the time or whatever to 45 seconds.
But not now.
Not now.
That's production notes, but I'm allowed to give that out since we're sitting here waiting forever.
And you know, what else am I thinking in regards to Orange Crush?
I want to do Orange Jeopardy one week on the show.
If you thought that G4 thing took forever on the show, I want to do Orange Jeopardy.
Can I give a hint about another Orange Crush?
Here's another thing I don't like about it.
It's like you're giving specific categories about certain people and stuff that have no friggin' clue about what the hell's going on.
It needs to be multiple.
Hold on, hold on.
Multiple choice?
It needs to either be multiple choice or it needs to be something else.
That's a good idea.
Maybe we should try multiple choice sometime.
I don't know nor care.
Here's the thing, Matt.
We understand that people aren't going to know a lot of the answers to these questions.
That's kind of why we're doing it because it's kind of like a knowledge thing.
We're teaching people out there who might have... People don't want to learn.
They just want to watch.
Some people are fanatics about some of the artists and so they like to know and they like to hear these things like birthdates of the artists.
I think...
Okay, time to go.
Alright, here we go.
Are you going to fill Jamie in on what tonight's... Oh, hi.
Fill me what?
Fill Jamie up.
Okay, the theme of tonight, Jamie, is called Foreplay, and these are questions about Osamu Kubota.
Which I read his website.
You did.
And you should know.
I'll probably get them wrong because I don't remember.
Okay, so do you have the time set?
Okay.
Three, two, one, go.
What year was he born?
74.
What's his blood type?
A. What tax song was Osamu Kubota consulted on?
Era.
What's his two main hobbies?
French and music.
What is the name of his production house?
Kubota Productions.
No.
Both of you got none of them right.
Okay, yeah.
He was born in 74, 72.
1965.
Okay.
Yeah.
He was born in 1965.
I'll relay, I'll relay.
You ask the questions, I'll relay the answers.
What's his blood type?
I'm going to say O. No, it's AB.
I almost said AB.
Yeah.
You were close.
Okay.
But it's AB, yeah.
Okay, what tax song was Osomo Kubota consulted on?
I know this one, Steal My Words.
Yeah, he did the piano part for Steal My Words.
Okay, what are his two main hobbies?
Cooking and traveling, right?
That's correct.
What is the name of his... Men and women, Matt?
That's his two hobbies?
Maybe.
I mean, if you take a look at him, he's kind of a mixture of the two.
Yeah, okay.
And what is the name of his production house?
This is really interesting.
This is very interesting, guys.
Listen.
Rob?
Okay.
What is the name of his production house?
Good Cool.
Yeah, that's the name of his production house.
Now, think about that for a second.
Okay.
Now we know who Good Cool is.
Yeah, I was talking Kubota live.
That's cool.
Good cool.
Anyway.
But yeah, so, yeah.
There you go.
I was going to ask how tall he was, but that's kind of a boring question.
How tall is he?
He's 5'8".
He's Japanese, so he's short.
I'm almost the same.
I think that's more interesting than the blood type question, but you know.
Well, okay.
What's that?
Yeah, he is.
He's fluent in French and English.
But the blood typing is, that's a common thing, like a Japanese thing.
Japanese really care about...
I know, I know.
Yeah, I know.
So, that's an interesting fact.
I mean, that's something that is not going to be on everyone else's website.
Yeah, when you go to Japan, you don't ask girls, what's your sign?
You say, what's your blood type?
Oh, and his sign's Gemini, because he was born in June.
Yeah, anyway.
What's your blood type?
Mmm, tasty.
You know, I was born in June, and I'm a Cancer.
Yeah, well, you are a Cancer.
I'm a Cancer on society.
Yes, exactly.
So that concludes another episode of Orange Crush.
This is the end of Orange Crush.
We really need to make a real song for it or something.
One of these days.
I love your version, Rob.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
Your hair's still there.
So now we have a little time to kill.
Shit, we could have done listless.
Actually, no, because we would have had to rush through it.
So we're kind of stuck with a little bit of time here.
We're stuck with Rob.
We're stuck with Rob.
I can talk about, uh, something about that, that list of, oh, no, we were talking about what game people would like to see a sequel to, what Final Fantasy game, and I was thinking about this while I was having a cigarette.
Um, Matt says Final Fantasy 3, I'm gonna go around and see who, uh, who thinks what, what should be done.
So, Rob, what, what Final Fantasy, and this could be any game with the name Final Fantasy in it, do you think should be a sequel, have a sequel done?
I'm tempted to say eight, so they can do it right.
But honestly, four, if any of them.
You geek.
I think that's a great choice, because four had a really interesting story.
Two in America, yes, for those who... Four was depressing.
Yeah, it was pretty depressing, but...
It's like, what else could go wrong in my life?
Final Fantasy VI, you don't know what happened to Terra.
Because she's like my bitch.
They need to do a sequel to Final Fantasy VI.
They can explain the goddamn ending.
Yeah, because it alludes to the fact that when the statues are destroyed that Terra might disappear.
But she might not.
It doesn't freaking give you any clues to what actually happens to her.
Sorry for the lack of spoiler warning, but if you haven't beaten it by now, we figure, you're probably not going to.
It doesn't matter if spoilers are given, because that game is excellent, and you should play it no matter what.
I mean, as far as RPG games are concerned, you have to play that game.
It doesn't really spoil anything.
That game is so good, I've had it since it came out, and I have played it like a million times.
In fact, just like a couple of weeks ago, I started playing it again.
So, yeah, that game is like so awesome.
Yeah.
Three, or six, whatever, you know.
Yeah, maybe.
8.
They should make 8 because, I don't know, they were talking about making 9 was supposed to be a sequel to 8 where they're gonna have, uh, it was gonna follow around the party of, uh, wasn't it the same, like, Lagunas or something like that?
Oh, uh, Laguna?
Laguna, yeah.
No spoils because we have somebody in the room that hasn't seen the end of 8.
I'm talking about Irene here, so...
It doesn't have anything.
I'm just saying they were supposed to follow around Laguna.
Are you talking about 9 before it was made?
Yeah, they were talking about like, it was going to be done in the Point of View of Laguna.
Oh, weird.
I have an interesting rumor that went around when 8 was being produced.
The first time, the first bit of information was given out about 8, it was just two pictures.
Three pictures, I'm sorry.
The logo, a picture of Laguna, and a picture of Squall.
Two male characters.
And people were looking at the logo...
I heard Rinoa had crabs.
She probably does at frickin'...
Anyway, um, does Jamie have an opinion about, oh, hold on, Rob's going next, hold on.
No, I just wanted to say, if they did do that for Final Fantasy VIII, it would be the best video game of all time.
Number one on G4's list, baby.
I want a Final Fantasy VIII that's good.
With much more squall, because squall's pretty.
And I want, like, Irvine's selfie, you know, happy.
Irvine's cool, he has a gun.
I agree with Jamie wholeheartedly.
And you know what?
I've said many times before and I'm going to say it again.
The movie should have been 8.
8 should have been the movie.
And what he means by that is the story in 8 should have been the actual movie.
The one that was with Final Fantasy the movie shouldn't have had anything to do with Final Fantasy at all.
Yeah, so, anywho.
Kind of like Mystic Quest.
Mystic Quest was like Final Fantasy for babies.
I'll tell you what Mystic Quest is.
In Japan, it's called Final Fantasy USA.
Thank you.
Do you know what the Final Fantasy VII in America was considered over there?
Final Fantasy VII International.
I'm playing Final Fantasy X International.
Which is like, basically it's as easy as Final Fantasy X, the Japanese version, but in English.
and it has a few extra features, I heard.
Not really.
No, the extra DVD.
You can see the difficulty of your sphere grid and that's about it.
The DVD, the extra DVD.
Mine didn't come with DVD.
They were supposed to release a separate DVD when you, maybe it was if you pre-ordered it.
That's fine, I've already got it subtitled.
It was, it was a, um, like an extra end story.
It's you running around being retarded.
Okay, well.
Seriously.
I haven't seen it yet, so.
I'll show it to you, I'll copy it for you.
But I have it subtitled if anyone on their chat room or... Hold on, what's that say?
Okay, now I watched in the show preview video for Final Fantasy X2 on G4.
No spoilers.
Oh, this is no spoiler.
In fact, it makes no sense.
The whole video, all it is, is Riona... Riona?
Or, not Riona.
Yuna?
Whatever, Yuna.
Some Japanese... Yuna Croft.
Yeah, anyway.
Yuna... Doing karaoke.
Singing.
Just singing.
Like some pop idol.
I'm like... I was watching it... No, she's singing like a pop idol, and I'm watching it going...
Are they going to show anything else?
No, okay, well this is interesting.
Did anybody see the, what was it, the Star Wars, I think it was a Lucasfilm, the little LucasArts computer game intro thing where all the stormtroopers were doing like a dance or whatever?
No.
I mean, what does that have to do with it?
But it was funny, so it's a way to promote the game.
It showed nothing interesting.
Nothing of the game.
They're supposed to be previewing the game to show me, to give me interest in playing the game.
All I saw were singing, like, the main theme.
Have you seen the Metal Gear Solid 2 commercial in Japan with Gackt in it?
No.
Has nothing to do with it, but it's Gackt, and so people are gonna be like, No, this has been in our chatroom.
It's, we're making fun of the Final Fantasy and other story.
And, um, Marin is saying, uh, Yuna's going, Waka, your stomach is fat, lolololol.
And he's like, shut the fuck up.
Okay.
Randomness.
Matt says, depends on how X2 ends.
Get the book.
I haven't given my idea, my opinion.
This is where I came up with the idea of asking everybody is because I was out there and I was thinking, what about other games in the Final Fantasy series?
I think they should do a sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics.
Anybody who's played Final Fantasy Tactics would go, what the fuck?
You play the game ten times through, the story is so convoluted that you're just like, huh?
Kind of like Mission Impossible 1, but worse.
And, I mean, the game was... No, there was a... Matt says there was no story.
There was a huge, great, deep story, but you have to play the game so many times, and I think it was kind of...
Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Final Fantasy Tactics Advance
You're a little kid that gets sucked into... Yes.
Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is about a kid in the present day, and he gets sucked into the world of Final Fantasy Tactics.
So there's cars and stuff at the beginning.
Kids getting sucked.
Yeah, does that turn you on, you little pedophile?
It would be cool to do a Final Fantasy Tactics, but in, like, the Final Fantasy VII world.
There... Well, Cloud showed up in Final Fantasy Tactics, and so there was some... Gay.
No, not gay.
Cloud was one of the strongest characters, if you...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Have, like, a Cloud Vincent Yaoi Fest.
That would be awesome.
I used to have some good Cloud Vincent Yaoi.
Yeah, there is, because they have, in the game, they have a scene where they show Vincent before he got, like, all messed up, and he's, like, in this suit, and he's all, like, you know, suave.
Well, what about the whole scene where he goes... I didn't spoil.
Cloud goes into that one box... No, no spoiler.
What about the scene where, like, Cloud has his shirt off, and he's, you know, walking... Never mind.
I wouldn't say that on the radio.
I know, I know, I'm just saying what Rice Princess just said, I would not say on the radio.
No, Matt, don't say it.
No.
Shh.
Anyway, no, shh.
God, Matt, stop it.
Okay, Rice Princess is trying to say a bunch of spoilers about Seven.
I know that everybody should have already played Final Fantasy 7, but I think there are people that might not have.
I'm not giving the microphone to Matt, he's going to ruin something.
What?
The fact that... Give me the mic.
Oh, by the way, Aeris dies, just so you know.
That was my favorite part of the damn game.
I have my game saved right there so that I can watch her die over and over and over again and I cheer every time.
I forgot what it is I call it.
You should call it like a scum-sucking crack whore and a homewrecker and a man-stealer because here's why I'm not getting mad at you guys because I'm pretty sure that nobody listening hasn't played the game or had the story spoiled already so
I mean, if we had the whole world listening to us right now.
Oh, hold on.
What did Irene say?
She said, what about in the future when they have millions of listeners and they do a rebroadcast of this show?
I guess I'm going to have to make this episode just disappear somehow.
We'll bleep it out.
Sorry, at the end of this episode, we're lost on the way over.
So the train animators finished it.
Yeah, and, you know, because millions of people are going to want to sit there and tune in and listen to us go, Fuck, shit, hell, whore, porno.
Speaking of porno.
Uh-oh, we had to get porno in.
I saw the best porno of all time this week.
Whore of the Rings.
I want to see it.
Oh, my God.
Will you guys bring it over?
Oh, it was the best.
All I have to say is they have that guy.
They have a guy playing golem, and he has a dick for a nose.
and don't forget the happy tree jizz the ent that jizzes all over the chick that's supposed to be Frodo yes, so everybody today check out check out Whore of the Rings that's Rob's porn pick of the week thank you oh, Whore of the Rings 2, sorry next week we can have a show without talking about porn well, next week I'm going to be getting my Dance Dance Revolution cosplay porn so, you know, we're going to have DDR Bomani porn
That'll be the highlight of next week's show.
We'll watch that live on it.
Can you try to not open it until next Sunday's show?
I don't think you'll be able to resist.
I don't think any of us will.
It'll be like having the freaking Pandora's box sitting right in front of us with DDR cosplay porn.
But we have to watch this on next week's show.
Where do you want me to take it?
Let's switch mics.
I didn't say you could have that.
This thing is great.
All right.
It's a coyote.
You know what?
Well, does anybody else have a quick topic?
Otherwise, I'm just going to go to final thoughts, I think.
Boobs.
Boobs?
You want to talk about boobs?
What about boobs?
Boobs are funny, but dicks are funnier.
Why are they funny?
Because they look funny.
Why?
Anyway... I seriously think that they're funny looking.
I'm sorry, repeat that again, Brad?
You know what looks phallic?
Your shower curtain.
What do you think?
I mean... Loki bought it.
It's... I swear, it looks like... It looks... Doesn't it look like a dick?
Great, so everybody's... Yeah, this is great radio, you guys.
Rob's shower curtain has a bunch of dicks on it.
Loki bought it.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, here.
Don't even circle in there.
My girlfriend bought that for us, okay?
And this does not look like a penis.
It looks like a cow or a lock.
You're right, it doesn't look like a penis.
It looks like several of them.
Um...
Anybody, I don't know, if you haven't seen it yet, go look at, um, uh, what's his name, Geiger?
H.R.
Geiger.
Look at H.R.
Geiger's works.
Somebody should make a shower curtain out of one of H.R.
Geiger's paintings.
The one with all the dicks and vaginas sticking to each other, and it's like a big mosaic thing of it.
It's really mosaic.
Mosaic.
Brad, I think that's supposed to be birds.
I think that's supposed to be birds.
The birds that turn into more birds.
What the hell is up with Enter the Matrix and all the hidden hack stuff in there?
Like, they have a whole thing... What was their name?
Seraphine or something like that?
Yeah.
Okay.
Anyway, they have a recording of her going, Hello, lover.
I have an itch in a place that I cannot scratch.
I need your nails on my back.
And... I like asparagus.
And also...
I only have asparagus for lunch.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Because asparagus is penis-shaped, too.
I don't know.
It is kind of phallic.
It does?
I don't go around smelling urine, thank you.
He informed me that asparagus makes your pee stink.
Yeah.
It's part of what it is.
Okay, I have a late FU of the week that somehow I didn't get before, my bad.
Tyrant would like to say FU to my ISP for not allowing me into the chat room.
You know what?
FU to OtherSideIRC because it's been screwing up all day anyway.
FU to my uncanny ability to get to be really great friends with women but not be able to have a relationship with my own.
Frown.
FU to school, I'm ready to be done, I don't want to do finals.
The Game Shits The Calories You Burn While Burninating The Ice Queen I need more alcohol in my life
And sex.
Lots of sex.
What about violence?
Then you'll have all three.
It's been six months!
Boo-hoo.
Shut up, bitch.
Rice Princess, your final thought?
Let's see if we can get a mic over there.
It borrows into the ground.
That's all I'm going to say.
Oh, wait, but that's on the website, isn't it?
No, in the game.
No, I'm doing a thief.
I must not have it yet.
Here.
Yeah, explanation of that, real quick.
Ragnarok Online, the thief class has a skill named Hide, and Ragnarok Online has such bad anguish in it, like the entire script is horrible.
It hides by borrowing into the ground, or whatever.
Borrowing in the ground.
I only like to borrow in the ground, I don't like borrowing above ground, thanks.
That's what the hide skill does.
Anyway, that's boring, so here.
Loki, your final thought?
My final thought is, if you're really, really, really, really desperate, I got this really cool pop-up ad today when I was browsing hacker sites.
You know, one of those porno pop-ups.
Anyways, it's this adult, what was it, like adultfinder or something like that, dot com or something like that.
And you go and you register and you can find people that just want to have sex.
In your area.
And it's gay, straight, everything.
That's kind of like Gay.com.
Well, yeah, but... You know this from experience, Brad?
The problem with Gay.com in Sacramento is that everybody's already fucked everybody else.
Doesn't mean you can't have more sex.
It's like, what, you have sex once, and then it's like, oh, can't have sex again, sorry.
Is that it?
That is all.
You want me to go, or you want to go?
I'll go.
I'm going to just take my final thought from AZHB.
He says,
Asparagus only smells bad if your gene for smelling asparagus-laden pee is dominant.
That must be why mine doesn't stink.
Your final thought, Jamie?
I'm never going to ask her again.
My final thought, for real, is... Give me a dollar!
Okay.
That's it.
Thanks for supporting...
Thanks for supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
I got x-ray vision.
Final word.
Rice Princess.
Final word.
Meow.
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

Extra Cheese Pizza Party at your house, I went just to check it out 19 Extra Lodges, what a shame, no one came Just us, eating all alone
You said take the pizza home, no sense letting all this go to waste So then I faced pizza all day and every day This cheese round the clock is getting me blocked And I sure don't care for irregularities
Tell me, why'd you have to go and make me so constipated?
Cause right now I'd do anything to just get my bowels evacuated In the bathroom, I sit and I wait and I strain and I sweat and I clench and I feel the pain Oh, should I take a laxative or have my colon irrigated?
No, no, no
I was feeling pretty down, till my girlfriend came around We're just so alike in every way, I gotta say In fact, I just thought I might, pop the question there that night
I was kissing her so tenderly, but woe is me Who would have guessed her family crest I'd suddenly spy, tattooed on her thigh And son of a gun, it's just like the one on me
Tell me, how was I supposed to know we were both related?
Believe me, if I knew she was my cousin, we never would have dated What to do now?
Should I go ahead and propose and get hitched and have kids with eleven toes And move to Alabama where that kind of thing is tolerated?
No, no, no
Tell me!
Thank you for watching!
Oh no, why'd I have to go and get myself all mutilated?
I gotta tell ya, life without a head kinda makes me irritated What a bummer, I can't blink, I can't cough, I can't sneeze But my neck is enjoying a pleasant breeze now Haven't been the same since my head and I was separated Nothing
Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.
And we're back for the Orange Challenge Afterbirth.
And everybody's sitting here talking about the godliness of Weird Al.
I don't know.
We'll play the Eddie Murphy song.
Oh, God.
My girl wants to potty all the time, potty.
Potty.
Potty.
Dude, yes.
You should play the Human League one that I got you.
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me?
Hi, Brad.
I just hit you.
Yeah, so, hi.
How you doing?
Vinyl.
I remember vinyl.
There's really not a lot to say for Afterbirth, I don't think.
Does anybody else have anything they want to say for Afterbirth?
They're going to watch this Weird Al thing.
Yeah, Rob, I want you to shut the hell up so we can watch Weird Al.
I need to get my Saturday Night Fever... Actually, you know what, Matt?
I need to get my Saturday Night Fever record for you.
So you can have the Bee Gees.
And Disco Inferno.
Wait, are you actually going to play this?
Ten minutes of pure disco.
Okay, fine, we'll play part of it.
Hey, Loki, the chat room wants you to sing along with us.
Where are we?
I have to find the lyrics.
Hold on, I have to find the lyrics.
Diamonds on your finger.
Diamonds on your finger, okay.
Okay, ready?
Okay.
I have to find it.
Okay.
My girl wants to party all the time, party all the time, party all the time My girl wants to party all the time, party all the time I feel like I'm at a wedding and Matt's drunk That'll never happen
And that's not even at the reception, that's actually at the actual ceremony.
God, Eddie Murphy sucks.
This girl has seen me in the club, just hanging out and dancing.
Okay, thank you.
You are not the next American Idol!
New album and a chipmunk album!
Hey Justin, I have something from PSYFAM that you don't!
That was beautiful!
Enough of that.
I have to give Rob the biggest high five for that comment.
That was comic gold.
Oh my god.
I gotta go change my shorts, that was too funny.
You know what, our afterbursts keep getting better and better.
They really do.
That started out pretty slow, but that... I think we should end it now.
End it while we're ahead.
Don't put that on.
No.
Put on your clothes!
Put on your clothes!
Yeah, Matt, put your clothes back on.
Okay, wait, we're doing another vinyl?
I scare.
Is Loki gonna sing along to this?
Okay, start your recorders now.
Start your recording now, because I'm not recording.
I don't know the fucking lyrics to this song.
He's gonna get the lyrics.
I can't do it without laughing.
You have to do this.
If you're going to torture us with this music, you have to please sing with it.
And then do the speed mix.
No, that's... We don't want to use that dog too much.
One trick, puppy.
Oh, god.
Here we go.
Are you recording?
We have it still on fast.
Yes.
Why did you make me do that?
I don't even know how to... I don't even know when it kicks in because it's... Just take it, Jesus.
You didn't play the instrumental version, did you?
No, I picked the extended mix.
You pick the extended mix.
Here, let me fix it.
Put it on the other side.
Ah, fine.
Loki ruining everything.
Good.
More time for people to start their recording.
Ah, here we go.
This should probably work.
All right.
All right, here we go.
Is this the real version now?
This is the real version.
All right.
It better be.
Yeah, I'm happy because I'm not the one making that ass up.
Why?
Is this because I want to play my music?
Yes, you are.
Yeah, where the hell are the lyrics?
Loki, your vinyl sucks my ass.
Peter Duel, The Blonde Waitress, and take their train spin around and they cross the floor.
Oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh,
Sing the words, even though the bitch isn't singing.
I don't like this song.
Here we go, here we go.
Walk like an Egyptian.
There you go.
This sucks.
No kidding.
I think the extended mix would have been better.
Spin the disc, yo.
Alright.
You're breaking speakers across the internet.
Alright, I think now's a good time to put the gun in the perivial forehead of Orange Lounge Radio.
Okay, that's it.
We're signing off.
End of Afterbirth.
We're going to kick you now.
Since it's six months into the year, June 1st, I think this is a good time to revive our non-stop New Years.
So enjoy.
We're going to start it off with Zipmania Best and take you out throughout the evening.
Thanks for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.
We appreciate your support.
Please whore up our listening hours.
We desperately need it.
Vote us a 5 and vote Legend of Max a 10.
I'm Ben Weisdahl.
Remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter and vote for Legend of Trance.
What did I say?
Legend of Max.
Oh my bad, Legend of Trance.
Oh, oh, oh, and someone needs to mix me the Sandbone Trio and Max 300.
Thank you.
