1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk and then some.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes, I will spank your child.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
If you're not gonna do your job, goddammit, I will.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, here's my big opening.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
A sphincter says why?

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm super. Thanks for asking.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh, you little bitch troll from hell!

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What am I doing here?

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Ha ha!

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Nooo!

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Eh?

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Dodge this.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Mm-hmm.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is a tasty burger.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Look, you stupid bastard!

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You've got no arms left!

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's a house?

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Look!

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's a flesh wound.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Searching for a boy in high school, is that useless?

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's searching for meaning in a polyshorn way.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh, yeah?

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Dark Sakura.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I ain't got a sniff, but I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I hate you!

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We are live, and this is episode number 48 for June the 8th of 2003.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You're tuned in to the Beeee Money Scene's most bitchy radio station of all things Le Money.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts, in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Jamie, Ms. Summers, if you're nasty.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Shut up, I'm watching Transformers.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You know her better, StarSakura.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
In that corner, say hello to our TechMasa Loki.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hello.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I lied, you guys. This is episode number 47, not 48. My bad.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I lost count.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oops.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So what? Everybody makes mistakes. Leave me alone.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Go away. Die.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Also with us tonight, say hello to nobody.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's right. It's empty. It's a ghost town here in Orange Lounge Radio headquarters.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Nobody loves Orange Lounge Radio anymore. I had a cry.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I missed it.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
They should be the crappiest transformers though when they show the commercials.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And we're getting phone calls as if we could take calls on the show.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm getting more carrots.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
How rude.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I am being a good girl today.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
How are you being a good girl?

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Eating carrots.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
As opposed to?

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Eating candy.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Alrighty.

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We'll be talking to us, ourselves, since there's no guests here, we'll just be talking to ourselves a little later.

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,020
later and first we're gonna take a quick break though featuring some five key

61
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:25,820
songs fun and this first song is called water flame and it's by K and actually a

62
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,940
buddy of mine Navi he's who's been on the show before he picked up the K album

63
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,100
not too long ago it's pretty cool cool yes so lots of fun stuff coming up

64
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,760
night we're gonna do listless tonight because we haven't done it forever and

65
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,160
yeah so enjoy we'll be back

66
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,760
And I still have a lot of work to do

67
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:22,760
Oh, but I am, I am

68
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,760
You

69
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,440
Na ikako nakunte arumakega

70
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,600
Na itoshii tetsa mou ichido

71
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,700
Mou tsukouchi anetano te

72
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,000
Mi wo kurei dai

73
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Thank you

74
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,340
We bout to push that

75
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,160
We bout to punch out now

76
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:35,380
I'll put you in my

77
00:08:35,380 --> 00:09:03,100
It's more contagious than SARS It's Orange Lounge Radio

78
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,100
That's right. You are listening to Orange Lawn's radio.

79
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,100
And you just listened to a whole bunch of five key songs.

80
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,100
Didn't you enjoy that?

81
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Athletics with Disco Dog, from 7th Mix, before that Love to Me.

82
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,100
Hey, Athletics do it on Please Don't Go.

83
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,100
That's right. Athletics also did War Game, right?

84
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,100
I think.

85
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,100
Before that, the Japanese version of Love to Me, as it's easily called.

86
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,100
It sounds better.

87
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,100
From 3rd Mix. That's debatable.

88
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,980
Before that, GTS featuring Melody Sexton from 4th Mix, brand new world, and starting that

89
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,020
off Kay from 7th Mix with Water Flames.

90
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,420
I can't get my thing to propel open.

91
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,900
That sounds like that Margaret Cho joke, Water's Flame.

92
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,940
So yeah, it's pretty mellow here tonight.

93
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:54,900
We don't really have a whole lot going on, not a lot going on in the land of Orange Lounge

94
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,900
Radio this week.

95
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,660
Actually, there were a lot of changes that happened at the station on June 1st.

96
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,060
Hopefully they've been invisible to you.

97
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,220
There's been some positive changes and there's been some negative changes.

98
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,600
And this is all due to Live 365.

99
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,660
Positive changes, we've been given a lot more web space.

100
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,160
So we're going to add a whole bunch of new songs.

101
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,340
So Jamie brought me a whole bunch of new stuff to add into the normal playlist.

102
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,460
You get to hear it all tonight.

103
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,260
And yes, I've got some good news and bad news.

104
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,820
The good news is I save lots of money by calling Geico.

105
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:37,220
So yeah, we're going to have a whole bunch of new stuff in rotation with Monty Music

106
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,220
More.

107
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:46,540
Bad news is, and this is the weird thing, this is the interesting part, they're tapping

108
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:53,260
how many live listeners we can have at once, so it's capped right now, yeah they're going

109
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,220
cap our listeners it's capped right now when we're live at a number which we've

110
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,100
only hit during one show ever what well I don't want to say on air but it's it's

111
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:11,300
that many times okay so we've only ever hit that number once so what what's

112
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,620
gonna happen is if we ever hit that number again what's gonna happen when

113
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,780
you try to connect to the station we're live it's gonna go we're sorry but this

114
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,420
station is too popular and you have to be a preferred member we're sorry that

115
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,420
you have SARS don't worry if you get that message we're gonna be aware of it

116
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:29,140
that we've hit our cap and what we'll do for the next week will increase our cap

117
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,660
we just don't want to have to pay any more money unless we have to but we

118
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,820
don't want our listeners to pay we're cheap bitches that's right

119
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:40,740
we take donations you can send this via PayPal now here's the next question is

120
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,780
that they go well if you don't like all of life 365 rules why don't you go

121
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,780
through shoutcast well cast is the suck well it's not necessarily that shoutcast

122
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:55,580
That sucks, I mean for talk radio it's actually pretty good, but this is the problem, we play

123
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:00,380
music and the music part you get into that whole licensing thing, now you could get into

124
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:07,620
like oh well you know you're doing Konami a favor here blah de blah de blah, I don't

125
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,300
think Konami cares the station exists either but let's just not take chances, especially

126
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,220
because we bring you a lot of dance media stuff, the other thing being is that if we

127
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,400
ran a Shoutcast server all the bandwidth would have to come off our personal line here at

128
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,600
the house. I'm sorry, but I'm too busy downloading porn to run a radio station off the computers

129
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
here.

130
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,080
I'm too busy downloading transformers.

131
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:33,720
So that's the reason why we stuck with Live 365 this whole time is that we can suck their

132
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,360
bandwidth away and tough. I just wanted to give you all those little updates about what's

133
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
going on with Live 365.

134
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,960
We hope you have a summer to remember.

135
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,960
Now let's uh, let's have a look at some more.

136
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
We need an apartment.

137
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
Oh my god, our apartment is so lame.

138
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
I'm going to read this.

139
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
You're going to read the apartment list?

140
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
Make a splash this summer.

141
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Whether your ideal of fun is heading out to the ball park, lounging by the pool, or watching

142
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,960
a spectacular sunset, we hope you have a summer to remember.

143
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
Enjoy!

144
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,960
They also have a list down there where you can sign up to watch rattlesnakes.

145
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,960
I kid you not.

146
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
What?

147
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
You're just going to watch them rattle?

148
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,960
What would they do?

149
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,960
Can you eat them?

150
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Let's see here.

151
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,960

have we left anything out?

162
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,960
Dude, hang gliding.

163
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,960
I can pretend like I'm in pilot wings.

164
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,960
But I really, really suck in pilot games.

165
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,960
But... But...

166
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,960
They don't have...

00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,960
Like, rifle shooting.

Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Death?

171
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
Yes! The dishes are done, man!

172
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,960
The dishes are done, man!

173
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,960
That was the best.

174
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,960
I'm sorry, that movie was the shi... I don't know why I'm thinking about that.

175
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
I feel like when she shot the guy in the pants with the water gun, it looked like he pissed himself.

176
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,960
I think I'm thinking of that movie today

177
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,960
because I saw Christina Applegate in a commercial.

178
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:13,960
Anyway, so now we had our update with what's going on with Live365. Let's get our update with the host.

179
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
Jamie, how was your week?

180
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,960
It was a week. I worked. I'm happily getting some overtime now.

181
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,960
Good!

182
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,960
I'm happy.

183
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,960
Anything Romani related?

184
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,960
I suck at 2DX now.

185
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Why do you suck at 2DX?

186
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Because I'm like a month out of serious practice. And I hurt my foot on DDR.

187
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,960
Was that using the pad that I have?

188
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,960
That was playing at the arcade. It was my butt foot.

189
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,960
Since then, my left foot's been swollen and it hasn't fit in my shoe.

190
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,960
Have you been playing with my new dance pad?

191
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,960
And I use the term, my new dance pad?

192
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,960
Not yet, yeah. Hey, over 30 days, it's legal.

193
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,960
There's a whole lot of other drama going on there. We don't get into it.

194
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:01,960
I will, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'll catch you up later.

195
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,960
That's my new dance pad, and my new third and fourth style.

196
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
Oh, yes.

197
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,960
Actually, they're slightly used, but they're mine, and that's what counts.

198
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,960
Is there anything else of yours that I might be able to have that you might not need?

199
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,960
You know, come to think of it, that's about all I made out with.

200
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,960
But I only took some slight losses.

201
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,960
I think the only thing I lost at everything was a Hedwig DVD.

202
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,960
So I kind of had to trade my Hedwig DVD for a...

203
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Oh, cry. I know.

204
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
I think I'd have that on VHS anyway.

205
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,960
To get you a new Hedwig DVD.

206
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

207
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,960
It doesn't matter.

208
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,960
But anyway, DDR.

209
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,960
Yes, you've been enjoying it?

210
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,960
By the way, I made removals.

211
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,400
I had already made my removal from my...

212
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

213
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
We're talking about later.

214
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
We're talking about later.

215
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
Other stuff.

216
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Other stuff.

217
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
We're cool.

218
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
We don't need to bring down the show with that chatter.

219
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Yeah, you know, if we really wanted to bring things down, we could say twin, but...

220
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,080
Oh, this is great.

221
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
This is great.

222
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,440
The other day, I played a joke on Loki.

223
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,440
You know how Loki...

224
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,440
We'll premiere this for you guys in a little while.

225
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,280
joke that one. I got it. Come on, let me tell them. Pretend it was funny. Can you pretend

226
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:10,280
it was funny for me? It was the most hilarious thing I've ever experienced, ever. That's

227
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:16,320
right. Orange Lounge Practical Jokes and Bloopers. Okay, this is what happened. Loki made a brand

228
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,360
new remix, and we're going to premiere it for you guys probably during the next break,

229
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,720
right? Yes? Sound good to me? Yes. So we'll introduce that. Well, I guess I have to tell

230
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,960
you what it is in order to tell you the joke.

231
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,960
So the new remix is Gravity, the Dark Sakura Burnination Mix.

232
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,000
It's cool.

233
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,360
And basically what it is, is it's Gravity kind of mixed with like some Rob Zombie.

234
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,480
Like there's a lot of Rob Zombie elements in it.

235
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,720
So what happened is that Loki left.

236
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,720
He went somewhere.

237
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,120
He went to go over to his girlfriend's or something and he left IRC in Orange Lounge

238
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,960
up and I kind of was just like looking, because sometimes I do that, you know, I'll see, oh

239
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,800
Is there anybody talking in Orange Lounge right now?

240
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,560
Should I set myself back from away and join in the chat or whatever?"

241
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,840
And I saw that Loki had said, hey, I finished this new mix, da-da-da-da-da.

242
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,080
And Brad and Irene were over here, you know, Rice Princess and Lanky Style were over here.

243
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,360
And of course, like, Brad being a big Loki fanboy was like, oh, I got to hear that remix.

244
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,800
I'm like, okay, well, now that Loki and I live together, let me just get on the network

245
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,800
and access Loki's computer and find it, because I know where he keeps all his remixes.

246
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,200
So I went in there and played it.

247
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,700
I'm like, and that's when I found out, okay, it's Rob Zombie, it's Gravity.

248
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,820
So I'm getting to a point here, trust me.

249
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:28,940
So when Loki finally gets home, he walks through the door and I get him, I'm like, oh my god,

250
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:33,580
for mommy's style, they're having a new remix contest and I heard the most awesome entry.

251
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,620
It's like somebody mixed Gravity with Rob Zombie and it's called the Twin Burnination

252
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,620
Mix.

253
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,180
Loki was not of the amused, but I was.

254
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:50,620
That joke fell on his face before I stepped in the door and it was just like, guess what?

255
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,620
I heard this new remix. Right away I knew what was going on.

256
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,620
So play it on me.

257
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,620
I was hoping that Loki would be too silly to realize that, you know,

258
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,620
oh, he might have gone on my computer and did it.

259
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,620
But see, Loki knows I'm a big old snoop. Like, no, I wouldn't look at anything else.

260
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,620
Just his remixes. He wouldn't share anything else on his computer, I'm sure.

261
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,620
I'm porn.

262
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,620
Oh, yeah, I'm porn. You do have your porn shared, right?

263
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,620
Um, no, it's not shared, sorry.

264
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,620
Poor Rob.

265
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,300
so mean to me

266
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,560
uh... okay

267
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,340
or

268
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,360
or you would be interested in that

269
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,900
true true or false there is dick and hetero-porn

270
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,780
some hetero-porn

271
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,580
and and and uh...

272
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,360
the um...

273
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,660
what was that

274
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,060
allie mcfeel

275
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,240
what about outta mcfeel

276
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,960
kids one of them

277
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,000
rice princess and lanky style are getting

278
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,840
Through a friend at Rocky Horror, they've been getting all these pornos.

279
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,840
Ally McFeel, Whore of the Rings.

280
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,840
You know Q.

281
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,840
Those are funny.

282
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,840
You know Q.

283
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,840
Yeah.

284
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,840
Q is the guy that looks like Striker's son from X2.

285
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,040
I saw the DVD exchange hands after the potty thing.

286
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Did you see X2?

287
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
Yes.

288
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
You remember Striker's son?

289
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Yeah.

290
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
That's Q.

291
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Oh my God, you're right!

292
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
Anyway.

293
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
Oh my God.

294
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:15,960
Okay, since we've been talking about it, why not Let's Play?

295
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,960
play Loki's brand new remix. How's that sound to you, Loki?

296
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
Good, I guess.

297
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,960
How's that sound to you, Miss Dark Sakura?

298
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,960
Sure.

299
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,960
Now is this going to be your new F.U. song of the week, or is it going to be...

300
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
No.

301
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
No? You still like your old one?

302
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Because the old one is...

303
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
This one has just the fuck out of it.

304
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
That has the stack work.

305
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
Yeah, I know. But we can find uses for this one.

306
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,960
Although I've been sort of thinking of another one for my F.U. song.

307
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,960
Oh, really now?

308
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,960
Sort of. I'm working on it.

309
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:51,960
Alright, so we're going to premiere this for you. This is Loki's, well actually we premiered it last night on The Fuck Off, but this is it's full show premiere. Here it is.

310
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,960
Loki vs. Tack featuring Rob Zombie, Gravity, the Dark Sakura Burnination mix.

311
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
Enjoy!

312
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:18,520
Oops, hi, oops, that was fucked up, Loki Vs. Tack featuring Rob Zombie, Gravity, the Dark

313
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,640
Sacra burnination mix, and let's say hello to our new guest that just arrived during

314
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,640
that little song.

315
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,640
New?

316
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,640
Well, you know.

317
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
It's a noob.

318
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
You're noob tonight.

319
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
Yeah.

320
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,640
It's noob.

321
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,640
Hello, lanky style.

322
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,640
Hey, what's up?

323
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,560
I was just telling you, see the reason why we played that is I was telling the story

324
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
about or-

325
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,220
Practical jokes and bloopers about how I joked with Loki last night, except it wasn't funny

326
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,220
at all.

327
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,220
But it was funny to me.

328
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,220
I laughed.

329
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,220
Not last night, the night before, I think.

330
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,220
Whatever.

331
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,220
It was funny.

332
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,220
I thought it was funny because you were so horrible at lying to him.

333
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,720
There's no way, like, as soon as you walked in and said, as soon as you walked in you

334
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,840
said, wow, I heard this awesome reading that you could see the look on his face, like,

335
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,640
Now, I know what he did. He found the hemp-y theme.

336
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,840
Wow, that's exactly what he said ten minutes ago.

337
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,400
Oh.

338
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,360
Well, see? Good minds think, or great minds think alike, whatever.

339
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,760
Say hello also to the Rice Princess.

340
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,480
Hello.

341
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,000
Hello, how are you?

342
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,520
I'm okay.

343
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,040
Orange Crush tonight?

344
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,720
Yep. Yay. For you and Jamie especially.

345
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,400
So she's, Taylor made this one for me and Jamie apparently. Yes.

346
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,080
This should be good. It's a kick in the ass. This should be very good.

347
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,480
So we have that to look forward to.

348
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,480
Stay tuned.

349
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,480
Let's see.

350
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,480
What else?

351
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,480
So, Jamie, did you have anything else you wanted to say about your week?

352
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,720
I kind of cut you off with my whole blooper story.

353
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,720
I'm sorry.

354
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,720
Thank you.

355
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,720
I'm a bad man.

356
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Thank you.

357
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,720
Here?

358
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
Now?

359
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,720
Show?

360
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,720
No.

361
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,720
Okay.

362
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,720
I have a cookie.

363
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
I have a cookie.

364
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
All right.

365
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
My week?

366
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
Yeah.

367
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:53,360
My last week was my last week of indulgence before I am a good girl.

368
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,800
And you're going to be on diet?

369
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
I was not on diet.

370
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
It's a lifestyle modification.

371
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
It's a lifestyle modification.

372
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
Amen.

373
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,640
I am cutting down to one, because I found out that working where I do, I cannot give

374
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
up soda completely.

375
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,640
Okay.

376
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,920
I need caffeine and I need sugar.

377
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,200
I'm cutting to one soda a day and it's balls.

378
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,640
I drink balls at work.

379
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,560
So if you're going to drink soda, why not drink the worst one for you?

380
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,560
No, I'm drinking a little of the most caffeine.

381
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,560
Actually, Joel would be worse than balls, probably.

382
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,560
Much worse.

383
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:32,560
And then, I am exchanging all of my cookies and fun, sweet stuff for carrots and broccoli.

384
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,560
That's good.

385
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,560
And I'm gonna not eat chocolate that much, I'm gonna have carob.

386
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,560
Ew, carob makes you poo.

387
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,560
Everything makes me poo, Rob.

388
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,560
With my really crappy digestion, I will eat what I can get.

389
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,560
This show makes me poo.

390
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
It obviously makes you want to poo because you're in the bathroom.

391
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,560
Oh, there you are.

392
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,560
No, I ran to turn on the A.C.

393
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,560
That's because it's...

394
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,560
No, not after class.

395
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,560
This is fun. Irene entered the room. It just got too hot in here.

396
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
I know.

397
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,560
It's getting hot in here.

398
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,560
There's something rotten here.

399
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,560
You better hold your nose.

400
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,560
Alright.

401
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,560
Oh, by the way, I haven't hoarded out the chat room yet tonight, so I probably should.

402
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,560
If you're listening and you want to join in the fun in our chat room

403
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,560

And don't forget about our LiveJournal community, too.

407
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:32,360
Yes, our LiveJournal community. www.livejournal.com slash users slash Orange Lounge.

Yes, post there, please.

409
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:40,000
Yeah, we need people to post. Jamie, you need to assign people a topic for this week to

410
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,040
post about in Orange Lounge. You know, like an essay. It'll be an essay project.

411
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:49,120
Best Bhumani song to fuck to. Best Bhumani song to fuck to. So we want to know in the

412
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,480
Orange Lounge Live Journal community the best Bhumani song to fuck to.

413
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,480
I'm in jealousy. Wow.

414
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,480
Holic. What the hell? No, make sure I'm on the maximum.

415
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,200
That's what they need. That's what they need. They need to have, you know, like how they

416
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,600
We have anime music videos, porno, baumani music videos.

417
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,220
You have the porn up there and you just sync it with the baumani music.

418
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,080
I saw the worst porn ever two weeks ago.

419
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,080
Yes.

420
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,720
It was something that, um, that, uh, Jabberwocky had.

421
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,720
What's that?

422
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,920
We were watching our movie night and, like, I had to leave before the anime actually started.

423
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
Uh huh.

424
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,520
But there was some, like, really rotten, horrible, like, camcorder porn.

425
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,520
And this woman had a ward.

426
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,520
No.

427
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,520
It was like trailer trash hooker or something, it was so bad.

428
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:48,520
And they showed this like shot of her area, and there's a big old wart there.

429
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,520
I was like, ew.

430
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:56,520
Now, do they have a name? The Wart? No, the Wart, the Wart had a name.

431
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
Bubba.

432
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:05,520
Um, FYI, um, our ever faithful Black Lab, our correspondent for the People's Republic of Texas, uh, Ben and I'll hope you enter here.

433
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:15,520
He is, um, TM. Trademark. Sorry. Uh, he is posting that in the community right now, so that you, it will not be forgotten.

434
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:24,520
Anyway, while we were talking about porn and Bamani, I thought this would be a good chance for me to ask Loki about his week.

435
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,520
What about my week?

436
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,520
That was pretty boring.

437
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,520
My girlfriend had her 21st birthday.

438
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,520
She was 21 on Wednesday, so she's happy.

439
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:44,520
Well, she could have been happier because also for her birthday she got strep throat, so that kind of sucked.

440
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,520
She's still sick, so yeah.

441
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,520
I guess you guys didn't go dancing or some club or something.

442
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,520
We never do that anyways.

443
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:57,720
go drinking, go to porn strip clubs, oh wait that's 18. She can't drink anyways because

444
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:04,160
of her disease. Oh yeah, I'm sorry. Anywho. That's no good. But no, we just hung out and

445
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:10,440
stuff and that's all. But yeah, I'm sure the thing Rob is wanting me to talk about. Tell

446
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:16,640
us, Loki, tell us. I believe last week we mentioned that I was going to be getting a

447
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,080
certain uh... video coming in

448
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:25,200
over at ebay coming in and um... this video that i have received and it's funny

449
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,320
is we only missed it by one day too

450
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,080
this video is called dance dance fuck

451
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,880
D D F

452
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,720
EAT ME BACK

453
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,740
it was supposed to be

454
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,580
a uh... bimani cosplay porno

455
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,060
but um...

456
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,300
instead it's not

457
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,300
people in a club dancing and then fucking pretty simple

458
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,620
can you play a little bit for us here in studio and then we could

459
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,300
if you could hook it up to the sound to so at least the I know this is bad radio

460
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,980
but at least they can hear the porn music

461
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,540
the music that goes with DDF because um

462
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,540
it does cut some of it kinda sounds like Max 300 and stuff

463
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,900
yes it's DDF 6 mix

464
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,300
by the way

465
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,200
1.5 I I don't know chicks with dicks episode

466
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,500
I I have no idea

467
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,180
But we're gonna we're gonna hear a little bit here of DDF get it and you guys want to see don't worry

468
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,640
It's it's children safe because it's mosaic so like all Japanese porn so

469
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,620
Rated-r porn it's like porn that would be on vh1 if they ever had porn

470
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:37,300
So they wouldn't it's like showgirls with the drawdown bikinis. Okay here does the intro screen?

471
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:43,300
Yeah, the sound should be going through. It's going through the little intros right now.

472
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,300
It looks like DNA. Oh, or not.

473
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:53,300
It's from Deep Five Studios, it looks like. Or is that Deep? Here it is. Dance, dance, fuck!

474
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,300
And here's the star, Wakabayashi Habayashi or something.

475
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,300
And there's the biggest pair of cameliffs I've ever seen.

476
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,300
And there they go.

477
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:18,300
To describe the scene for you guys, it's just some chick in a nightclub wearing a bunch of silver.

478
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,300
And rubbing herself.

479
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,300
And she's rubbing and feeling herself.

480
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:25,300
And then she's just kind of getting screwed by other guys.

481
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,300
And this has nothing to do with DDR. They're not dancing on a DDR pad or anything.

482
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,300
Oh, hey.

483
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:35,300
Occasionally on the screen it will flash DD, DD Dance Dance Fox 6 mix.

484
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,300
I don't think so.

485
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:41,300
It dates back in the early 90's except it's like The Grind in Japan on MTV.

486
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,300
That's funny.

487
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:48,300
Well I think, yeah, Jamie says with fucking, but I think if it was The Grind in Japan there would probably be fucking anyway.

488
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,300
Right on there on TV.

489
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,300
Alright, let's uh, let's give it a head here.

490
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,300
Is this one really any good?

491
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,300
It's not funny.

492
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,300
Hey, that's funny.

493
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,300
I don't know how to do it that way.

494
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:33,500
absolutely nothing to do with DDR at all except for the fact that sometimes on

495
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,500
the screen it'll flash the title dance dance fuck and they're in a nightclub

496
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,540
and they're dressed like nightclub they're dressed like power chicks

497
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:44,780
without the boots okay I'm gonna sit over here now that's that's now I'm my

498
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:52,260
socks camera one what is multi angles I don't know it just says camera one and

499
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,260
And she's dancing.

500
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:58,260
Her music isn't any good, really.

501
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,260
Now, Loki, what would you say about putting this in a sim?

502
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:05,260
That'd be hilarious.

503
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,260
You know, I should do that for a random video.

504
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,260
Can I still enter Turnimix 4?

505
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,260
You have four? No, you can't.

506
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:18,260
Oh, but I'll get to Turnimix 4 later, um, because we've got news on that too, but uh...

507
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,260
Yeah.

508
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,260
Where can I get the soundtrack for this?

509
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,260
It's pretty good.

510
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,260
Oh, oh, we got another song.

511
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,260
This could be Tack.

512
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,260
No!

513
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,260
This sounds like we got the rage on Sunday night.

514
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:41,260
And again, it's the same girl in the silver dress who's got like...

515
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:44,260
She's like the slut of the nightclub.

516
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,260
Damn, I wish Tourney McPaw wasn't close because I would so enter this.

517
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,860
I feel like she has such bloody friends with her.

518
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,260
And I'd have this in the background. It's a video, too.

519
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,760
There's always Trini Makes Five.

520
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,760
Coming soon to, uh, screen near you.

521
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,660
Anyway, yeah.

522
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,160
So, dance, dance, fuck.

523
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,160
Kinda sucks.

524
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,760
She's getting tongue now.

525
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,960
That's not...

526
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,360
Ew, that's not even slightly erotic.

527
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,360
At all.

528
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,060
That looks like something out of a sci-

529
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,960
Oh, my God!

530
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,460
No, no, no.

531
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,460
This is a history, I mean an animal planet or something, it looks like.

532
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,460
Discovery Channel.

533
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,460
It looks like something out of a bad sized fiction movie.

534
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,460
It looks like something from hentai anime.

535
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,460
That guy does not know how to make out at all.

536
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,460
He's like, what am I doing here?

537
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,460
I don't care, he's riding me.

538
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:40,460
Alright, I think we can turn off the bad porn now, thank you.

539
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,460
That looks really awful.

540
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,460
There it is.

541
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,460
You heard it here first.

542
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,460
That's ten minutes of my life I'm never getting back.

543
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,460
Dance, dance, fuck, six mix.

544
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,460
Alright.

545
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,460
So is that all you want to say about your week?

546
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,460
Uh, yeah.

547
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,460
I didn't do too much of them to make a remix.

548
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,460
Um...

549
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,460
What else did I do? I don't know.

550
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,460
I didn't do really much of anything.

551
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,460
Slap.

552
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,460
That's tired.

553
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,460
Um...

554
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,460
Yeah, that's it.

555
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,460
Wow. Okay.

556
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,460
Still trying to get the phones working.

557
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,460
Nah, I don't know.

558
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,460
Find it eventually.

559
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,460
I got a cool hat this weekend.

560
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,460
And I have a shirt with Judd Nelson on it and I'm wearing it.

561
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,460
What a cool.

562
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,460
And I saw pictures of him now from that show that he has.

563
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,460
It was dorky.

564
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,460
Something, Susan.

565
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,460
Suddenly Susan?

566
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,460
Yeah, he plays for the office manager.

567
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,460
I think suddenly Susan's been off the air for a couple of years.

568
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,460
Okay, well I don't watch TV, okay?

569
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,460
Okay.

570
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,460
But he looks dorky now.

571
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,460
I mean, he's so, you know, cute.

572
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,460
But with his haircut he looks really dorky.

573
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,460
And not when he was young and hot.

574
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,460
Breakfast club's cool though.

575
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,460
He looks dorky in a not cool way.

576
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,460
Not like Elijah Wood, you know, he's dorky in a cool way, right?

577
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,460
Lankystyle, since you ruthlessly took the mic away from Jamie, you want to tell us about your week?

578
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,460
My week? Yes, it was week. Haha.

579
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:16,460
Nah, just same old me, you know, unemployed, playing ragnarok.

580
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:22,460
Um, let me think, if anything special happened besides the, you know, thing you found out about today.

581
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,460
Tell us about it. You want to tell us about it? Yeah.

582
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:34,460
Today, I mean, I got an email June 2nd, but it went to my garbage folder, my, my, my fucking junk mail folder for oatmeal because they suck, and they can't decipher.

583
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:41,460
I usually get the enlarge your penis emails right to my inbox, but all the other stuff that's not junkware goes to my junk folder.

584
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,460
So I didn't check it until today, which is what, the 8th?

585
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:52,460
Well, I got accepted to be a Final Fantasy XI beta tester, and they're sending me my shit, and that's going to be pretty cool.

586
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,460
On Windows.

587
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,460
Yay.

588
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,460
Yeah, yay is cool. So if anybody...

589
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:03,460
We can talk about, you know, how the game looks to people, if people listening want to hear, you know, might be interested in getting it.

590
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,780
in getting it yeah I'd be curious so yeah but I don't know what it's gonna

591
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:13,100
get here so I know Jamie and did you and your fiancee both apply for the ps2

592
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:17,000
beta and I applied for the windows beta gotcha I can play that while I'm playing

593
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,580
red rock

594
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:33,440
Irene's Irene saying that she's never gonna see me again because I've got

595
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:39,440
Do they have a launch date for Final Fantasy XI on computer yet?

596
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,440
No, I don't know. There might be, I just haven't been looking into it.

597
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,440
Because I'm just like, hey, I'm a beta tester, so I get to play it before everybody else.

598
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Well, not everybody else.

599
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,440
But anywho, I don't know anybody else who is. I mean, I think it's just me, Jamie, and Van.

600
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,440
Well, that'd be fun. Good luck to you guys.

601
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,440
You should apply.

602
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,440
It's probably too late now, isn't it?

603
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,280
Well, the email said something about July is when the public beta starts.

604
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,320
So it's like less than a month of closed beta. That's interesting.

605
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:11,280
Which is kind of weird. So, I mean, you could always play the public beta in July.

606
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,560
Oh, whatever. Yeah, you don't care. You're too popular. No, I'm excited about

607
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,720
Final Fantasy XI. I kind of wish it was on GameCube, because I don't know why.

608
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,560
I just love my GameCube, and I want everything to be on it.

609
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,720
Go to hell.

610
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,240
I'm already there.

611
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,860
Um, listen, you talk about GameCube. Shut up.

612
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:36,360
My computer, you know what, I just can't play games on my computer, like even when I seem to have a top-of-the-line system, games suck to play on my computer, they really do.

613
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,860
I can't get it out there, but they cost you a little.

614
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,360
I know.

615
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,360
Next week, by the way, I'm bringing over Soul Calibur 2.

616
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,360
Oh yeah, cool.

617
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,360
I've had it for like a month.

618
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,360
I saw the demo at Fry's this week.

619
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,860
The demo doesn't do the game justice, I have GameCube, of course.

620
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:56,360
I guess I'll talk about my week.

621
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:01,860
Navi and I decided to go to Fry's on Monday because I wanted to make a random purchase

622
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,420
so I decided I wanted to buy a GameCube game and it came down to two games like we were

623
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:11,880
looking and we were either going to get Mario Party 4 or Cubivore and I decided to get Mario

624
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,760
Party 4 because I like to be popular and when I get Mario Party 4 people will come over

625
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:23,040
more and want to play so I bought it and that worked for Friday but Cubivore actually what

626
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:29,520
What happened is, Navi was so obsessed with Cubivore and the idea of it, he went and freaking

627
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,720
bought it.

628
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,080
And it's actually pretty cool, because you get to eat things.

629
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,840
You ruthlessly tear the tails off of little cube snakes and stuff.

630
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:44,480
It's kind of like a mix between Facebook 2000, except everything is cubes in 3D, and EVO,

631
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,600
that old SNES game, where you kind of evolve, you eat things, you get experience points

632
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,360
and you can evolve.

633
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,600
But everything's still cubes, so it's kind of weird.

634
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:59,600
It's very interesting. I especially love the screen where you have to go mate because you have to mate to have offspring to get more limbs, I guess.

635
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,600
It's kind of complicated. Well, not really.

636
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,600
But it's funny because it says, like, you attracted five females.

637
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,600
And then it says, would you like to mate? Yes or no?

638
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,600
The mating scene in Cube of War is, like, the best thing I've seen in any video game in the past year.

639
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,600
I just love the question. Would you like to mate? Yes or no?

640
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,600
Would you like to mate? Yes or no?

641
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,600
If a guy's playing the game, who's going to answer no?

642
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,600
I mean, those are some pretty hot cube chicks.

643
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:26,600
And then at the end he says, I mated with five females.

644
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,600
And I had three kids, or three of the females had kids.

645
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Sounds like an episode of Jerry Springer.

646
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,600
Yeah, it's Cube Springer, Jerry Springer.

647
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,600
So Rice Princess, how was your week?

648
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,600
Oh, sorry.

649
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,600
Everything was always, oh, I started a diet on Monday, but that's about it.

650
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
How's your diet going?

651
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
It's been going pretty good.

652
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,600
I think I lost like five pounds.

653
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,600
Congratulations on all of that.

654
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,600
Yay.

655
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
Oh my god.

656
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,600
Other than that, it's been pretty boring.

657
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,600
I think I need to go on a lifestyle change.

658
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Yeah, it's not a real diet sort of thing.

659
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,600
It's a lifestyle change.

660
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,600
Okay, that's good.

661
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,600
Yeah, and that's about it.

662
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,600
Boring old me.

663
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Alright, so anybody else have anything they want to say here during the first little bit of show?

664
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,600
I actually have been going on a while now, but anybody else have something we want to add to the conversation going on right now?

665
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,600
Um, I'm cool.

666
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,600
Okay.

667
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,600
Everyone wants to be like me.

668
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
Okay.

669
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
Sure, Jamie.

670
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Okay.

671
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,600
I'm just kidding.

672
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,600
I'm sorry.

673
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,600
Okay.

674
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:37,600
I think we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to start this break off with...

675
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
Guitar Freaks.

676
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,600
What?

677
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,600
Guitar Freaks.

678
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,600
What?

679
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,600
I can't hear.

680
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,600
Guitar Freaks.

681
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:50,440
I wanted to play one more song real fast, but since this is graduation week for a lot

682
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,440

683
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,440
Isn't that cute?

684
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,120
I'll go chill out in my ears as I watch it go down.

People don't matter

693
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:09,420
Down around the corner, I head for my phone here

694
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,420
To see that long train run, watch them disappear

695
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:18,420
Without love, where would you be now?

696
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:27,420
Without love

697

You know they're running late, without love Where would you be now, nah, nah, nah Without

698
00:45:52,300 --> 00:46:04,340
And the wheels go round and round, and the steel rail back holding hard, and the miles

699
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:07,340
as they go down.

700
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,340
What you got now?

701
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:16,340
Without love

702
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:23,340
Without love

703
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:28,340

704
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,340
Oh

705
00:47:53,340 --> 00:48:22,340
Orange Lounge Radio is proud to present a celebrity interview.

706
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:24,340
Can you introduce yourself for our listeners?

707
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,340
I'm Miss Cleo.

708
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,340
Oh, it's great to have you on the show today.

709
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,340

I'm great, thanks.

711
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,340

712
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,340
Well, yes, actually I wanted to know...

713
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:38,340
Can I please have your first name only and your birthdate, please?

714
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:43,340
Uh, well, no, I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,340
Alright, go ahead.

716
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:48,340
Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?

717
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,340
Is he incarcerated?

718
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:54,340
Uh, actually, no he's not, but what do you think of the ever-ranty dark sakura?

719
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:57,140
Hi, dear, how are you? I love you.

I see you two must know each other. Well, what do you think of Sky?

721
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,540
Did he used to play football when he was in high school?

722
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,040
Well, actually, no he didn't.

723
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,140
Ha ha ha ha!

724
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,440
Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?

725
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,240
I want you to really remember the pill, all right?

726
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,540
I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly.

727
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:17,140

Huh huh?

736
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:53,740
We hope you enjoy our cheesy little promos.

737
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:57,740
Uh, Jamie threatened in her live journal today to make some new ones this week. I'm excited.

738
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:58,740
I did?

739
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,740
Yeah, you said you wanted to make a promo.

740
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,740
Oh, that's right. I did.

741
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,740
Hey, go for it, dude.

742
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:05,740
The dudette.

743
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,740
Jamie.

744
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:07,740
Okay.

745
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:11,740
I want to make a couple more celebrity interviews, too. I gotta call some people and get more celebrity interviews.

746
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:13,740
Cause that was fun interviewing Miss Cleo.

747
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,740
I might try to get some mufflers.

748
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:19,740
She's... Hey, hey, hey, hey! Stop it with some gibber!

749
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:23,740
Oh, yeah! Actually, Brad does a really good impression of myself.

750
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:27,740
I am very sad. Why? Because Miss Elizabeth is dead. Who's Miss Elizabeth?

751
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:31,740
She was much of his wife, like, in the 80s.

752
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:35,740
I don't follow wrestling.

753
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:39,740
And they have what you really can't stand. What? What?

754
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,740
We're doing wrestling drama. Oh, alright, alright. Whatever.

755
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,740
Shall we get to the FUs of the Week?

756
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:47,740
Yeah.

757
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:48,740
Do you want the new song?

758
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:49,740
New.

759
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:50,740
You want the new one?

760
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:51,740
Alright.

761
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:52,740
Here we go.

762
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,740
It is now FU of the Week time.

763
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,740
And what is this FU of the Week thing all about, Jamie?

764
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,740
Where we get pissed off and tell you about it.

765
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:22,580
The first one goes towards the stupid bit she was in front of me driving.

766
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:26,820
She was obviously drunk and she would, true to the law says you have to stop a full car

767
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:30,700
link behind the person in front of you at a stop light, but who follows that anyway?

768
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:35,740
And she was stopping and then she was like driving all twitchy so I just had to speed

769
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,740
around her.

770
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:37,740
She was just stupid.

771
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:41,340
And then her question in the seat next to her was obviously on E. She kept putting her

772
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:45,060
hands in the air and then trying to hug the girl in the front seat.

773
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:48,460
And then, uh, it's like having SARS.

774
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:52,900
The whole beginning of this week I was so sick, it was my allergies.

775
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:57,260
And thanks to, uh, free gifts from Allegra and Claritin B, I was all better.

776
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:59,140
But yeah, it sucked.

777
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:04,340
I didn't have a voice, but I work in freaking customer service, so what's up?

778
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:11,500
And then another one goes to not having, you know, money and stuff, and my breaks, which

779
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,760
grind.

780
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,260
And I think that's about it.

781
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:20,300
I'm not really all that angsty that machine works, that's my life, that's sort of happy

782
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,300
right now.

783
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,300
Aww, that's so cute, bleh.

784
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,940
Bite my ass, fuck you.

785
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,220
See, I can get you ready.

786
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:37,060
And another one goes to Rob, and another one goes toward all of these communities I'm a

787
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:42,660
member of, just about, in my life journal, because I'm taking them all off, because people

788
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,100
just post really stupid stuff.

789
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:51,080
I'm leaving up the DDR and Bamani communities, but like, you know, this has been some stupid

790
00:52:51,080 --> 00:53:20,240
I'm on this roleplay board, and there's this guy being all god-mode-y, I hate god mode

791
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:25,960
RPG players hate it when especially when you're not doing anything with a set

792
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,380
combat-based rule and he's like oh I just had me appear there and you're blah

793
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:33,200
blah blah I'm like okay and wearing a professional suit and then feels like

794
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,600
well you've been here a month ago you wouldn't know blah blah blah okay so he

795
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:40,200
got smacked down by one of the admins on the board so that made me feel all happy

796
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:45,840
and justified and I couldn't help rubbing his nose in it so did he have an

797
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:50,080
ogre slaying knife maybe that's why I got an ogre slaying knife as a plus

798
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:57,200
money against ogres you're not even there you're getting drunk okay no no it

799
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:02,720
wasn't that he's just being stupid I I really really and I another thing

800
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:08,280
people who have their live journals and cannot use paragraphs or complete

801
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:13,120
sentences unless you're doing it on purpose and that that's the case stop

802
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:20,960
all right there and the city's people are really you know nice be a really

803
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,200
nice going out over here great people that I know I love you to death but

804
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:31,800
please use grammatically correct sentence structure when you post in your

805
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:36,880
live journal and also for people who put humongous posts you know I understand

806
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,440
that's fine I do it too but there's such a feature called LJ cut it's a really

807
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:48,440
easy girl to remember. You can even go onto the FAQ page and cut and paste. Wow! Do it!

808
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:54,440
Okay, I'm done. Wow. I could name names, but I won't. I'll just tell them their face later.

809
00:54:54,440 --> 00:55:01,440
Logie. Sorry for messing with the phone. I forgot to connect it through the sound board.

810
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,440
Yeah, we want to hear your conversation that you're going to have. I was trying to, because

811
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,440
I fixed something. I was seeing if it worked. I was calling my voicemail to see if it could

812
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,440
as if it left a message that meant the phones were working.

813
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,440
So Matt's first fuck you goes to Brad.

814
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,440
No, I'm not that mad this week, actually.

815
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,440
Um, first, uh, slight, okay.

816
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,440
First F.U. of the week, not really an F.U. of the week,

817
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,440
kind of like I'm laughing at you because you're stupid type of thing.

818
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:30,440
Um, I'm gonna laugh at, uh, the stupid bitch that I mentioned last week.

819
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,440
Because, hi, you're licensed, you have to take a picture.

820
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,440
You have to take the stupid veil off, you stupid bastard.

821
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:40,440
Go home! Go back to your country, you freaking Al-Qaeda!

822
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:45,440
Anyway, so, um, enough of that, and, um, let's see, what else?

823
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:51,440
Um, I have to use the stupid phone program in that war game because I can hear the phone, but I can't talk.

824
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:57,440
I mean, it's kind of cool and all, but I like to talk, and that would be cool.

825
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,440
Uh, what else?

826
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:06,440
Um, I don't know, that's good for not having that many good files coming out lately, freaking sim files.

827
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:13,440
Um, also the fact that terrible Mr. Grinshaw was out today. Oh yeah, terrible Mr. Grinshaw came out today, yay.

828
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:22,440
Um, also all these phone programs that are, you know, for making phone calls on your PC that claim to be free, but they're not.

829
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:28,440
I hate that. Why even say they're free if you're not going to make them free if you have to pay money to use the phone for free?

830
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:37,440
I don't know. I'm not that smart and all, but paying money to use the phone for free is just paying to use the phone.

831
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:44,440
That's like saying, well, you're paying the 35 cents to use the pay phone as a right to use the phone for free. Makes no sense.

832
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:55,440
That's it. I really didn't have anything because I've been kind of like busy with other stuff. Yeah, I just really haven't been paying attention.

833
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:11,440
My F.U. of the week goes to X's that screw your friend in the shower message. Short symbol to the point.

834
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,340
What's your point?

835
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:18,260
Brad, anything?

836
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,260
Sorry about that, Ross.

837
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:22,260
That's alright, it happens.

838
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:23,260
No hard feelings there.

839
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:26,700
He just didn't fall into the penis.

840
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:27,700
Let's not drag it out.

841
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,700
It's true.

842
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:29,700
His hand landed there.

843
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:30,700
Twenty-five.

844
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:31,700
Twenty-five.

845
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:32,700
Up and down.

846
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:41,300
Okay, um, I'm glad Loki brought that up about the crazy

847
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:45,380
lady who won't take her veil off because I wanted to expound on that, that's a word right?

848
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:50,100
Hold on, hold on, before Matt gives it, because I wanted to say something last time you brought

849
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,020
up like two weeks ago and I forgot and I think it really does it justice, I don't know if

850
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:56,840
people know but in this country, especially in California, just anywhere in the country

851
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:03,940
in America, driving, having a driver's license is a privilege, not a right. You don't have

852
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:08,660
the right to have a driver's license, it's something you have to strive to get, you know,

853
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:13,940
have to go do it and it's just a privilege so if you're not you know you can't fucking sue

854
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:17,220
i don't know if they are suing but i would be surprised they're trying to sue the country for

855
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:21,940
not letting her have her fucking license picture taken or having a license but you can't do that

856
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:27,140
because it's not your right we're not infringing on your rights as an american or as a as a

857
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:32,500
alien legal alien or as an alien because it's not your right to have a license fucking follow the

858
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:38,900
rules. Retard. Oh, and another thing. All these people who are crossing the border from

859
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:43,740
Mexico and stuff, who are getting killed because they're breaking the law. No, I'm not racist,

860
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:48,620
I'm just saying. We have a law that says you can't try to, you know, you have to come in

861
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:53,100
an illegal way. If you do it illegally, you're a criminal. And if you are a criminal by doing

862
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:57,820
it illegally and you get hurt doing it, you can't sue our country, which has been happening.

863
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:00,980
Because you're, you're a freaking criminal in the first place for breaking an American

864
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:01,980
I don't know.

865
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:02,980
I'm...

866
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:03,980
Ugh!

867
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:04,980
Anger.

868
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:05,980
Okay.

869
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:06,980
What did you say, Matt?

870
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:07,980
Uh...

871
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:08,980
MTV Music Awards are on.

872
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:09,980
Anyways, um, no.

873
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:13,980
My Effie of the Week, actually, I forgot, is for stupid movie sequels.

874
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,980
For God's sake, stop making stupid...

875
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:17,980
I'm kidding.

876
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:20,980
Stop making Brad get to sing.

877
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:25,980
Like, for instance, Legally Blonde 2.

878
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,980
I didn't want to watch Legally Blonde 2.

879
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:32,980
I didn't want to watch Legally Blonde 1. I don't want to see a sequel of it.

880
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,980
They're talking about making it Back to the Future IV.

881
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:39,980
They ended it fine, and now they're making it Back to the Future IV.

882
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:40,980
Back to the Future IV.

883
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:46,980
Not only will the two directors not be back for it, but Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox will not be in it.

884
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:47,980
Oh, I was going to say, maybe-

885
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:48,980
And it might be animated.

886
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:52,980
I was going to say, does he go back in time when he didn't have Parkinson's disease or whatever?

887
00:59:52,980 --> 01:00:00,980
I was supposed to go back to 1985, but my hand was shaking so much that I went to 38.5.

888
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:04,980
It was a hijinks that ensued.

889
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,980
This is wacky fun for the family.

890
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:13,980
You said hijinks, that's funny.

891
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:19,980
Yeah, he wouldn't be so good at that gun game anymore.

892
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:21,980
Yeah.

893
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:22,980
What?

894
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,980
Uh, yeah, I'm done.

895
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:30,980
Wouldn't a superhero movie with Christopher Reeve and Michael J. Fox be great?

896
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:34,980
It would be The Adventures of Handyman and the Tiny Avenger.

897
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:37,980
Alright, um...

898
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:41,980
Uh, let's see, Rice Princess, do you have anything you'd like to, uh, F you today?

899
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:55,980
I don't really have anything that I'm post-op about. Can I do a love you of the week?

900
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:58,980
Yeah, you can do a love of the week. Do we have love yous of the week?

901
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:06,980
Yeah, sure, why not? I give my love you to Rob because he bought me that Dog of Glee notebook and it was so cute. Thank you so much. It was so great.

902
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:09,980
Oh, it's the Movie Awards or whatever?

903
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:12,980
They're parodying the Matrix here at the Movie Awards.

904
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:16,980
And I love you too Brad, cause he's cool.

905
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:17,980
Aww.

906
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:19,980
I love you too. This is really weird.

907
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,980
And they have Wanda Sykes as the Oracle.

908
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:22,980
Matt? Matt?

909
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:27,980
Matt turned on the MTV Awards Matrix thing.

910
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,980
Justin Timberlake is some sort of like...

911
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:34,980
I wanted to see this. For the Movie Awards this year, they did a parody of the Matrix reload.

912
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:40,980
And I really wanted to see this. I'm sorry that I've broken the FUs. I'm sure people can go ahead and, uh, yeah.

913
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:43,980
Well, let's continue on with the FUs.

914
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,980
FU to the MTV Movie Awards, Paul Sham.

915
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:51,980
Justin's really dancing. Like, he's doing the Matrix stuff. He's dancing.

916
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:56,980
Alright, uh, let's go to the chatroom FUs. Are you done with your, uh, love yous, Irene? Okay.

I don't feel like waiting until November because it was so good.

926
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:43,380
Fuck the Six Flags near me because they had to get rid of their four extremes because some bitch complained about the word bitch in it.

927
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:47,380
Okay, nobody even heard that at all.

928
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:55,380
I'm sorry, we're kind of sidetracked by watching Sean William Scott playing Mr. or I'm sorry, Agent Smith.

929
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:59,780
I want to come back to that later and make a little topic out of that. That was interesting

930
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,080

931
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,640
Really stupid. Okay. Anyway, hi

01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:10,100
Fuck exams this week and I don't normally say this because there is a reasoning for exams

933
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:15,720
But everyone is running around like chickens without dicks trying to remember everything and it's really annoying. So fuck them

934
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:42,080
I have no FUs actually, just the happy news about the female that has contacted me over

F you to the pains of cleaning out a house.

942
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,520
And lastly, huge F you to Dell, because my 19 inch CRT died.

943
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,740
And not only that, but so did my DVD plus RW drive.

944
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:24,600
It won't burn DVD-R anymore.

945
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,400
Oh sure, RW works fine, but R is much cheaper.

946
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,120
F you Dell.

947
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,600
You better fix this stuff for free because of my warranty

948
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:34,000
when I call you tomorrow.

949
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,120
It says O after that.

950
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,700
I think you meant to type or else.

951
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:40,040
Dude, you're getting a broken Dell.

952
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:45,040
Dude, you're getting a dump.

953
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,040
Anyway.

954
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:50,040
F you to summer school, says Nico Adachi.

955
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:53,040
That would suck if you have to go to summer school, I'm sorry.

956
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:59,040
Akuma GM would like to say F you to my infernal MP3 player that decided to go on the blink.

957
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:02,040
You used to work so well until you started to skip for no reason.

958
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:06,040
Did you set MP3 player I stab at thee?

959
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:10,040
Why didn't any of you play anyway? I should just get a CD player that can read MP3s on a CD.

960
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,040
You know, I don't read minds.

961
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,040
I would just like to share.

962
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:20,040
Alright, moving right along, we have the 23rd Magus's FUs.

963
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,040
FU to graduation rehearsal.

964
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:28,040
Four hours stuck in the football field in the hot sun, just because 200 fucking seniors can't walk and step.

965
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,040
It's Johnson, so they have to pimp strut.

966
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:33,040
Sun burnination.

967
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,040
That's a new word.

968
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:38,340
new word. F U to me for being such a damn glutton and ordering the biggest sundae they

969
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:42,760
have at leather bees in celebration. Perps. F U to summer visitation. I don't want to

970
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:48,760
go to Kentucky. God damn it. Looks for lawyers, damnedest they are.

971
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:54,760
DDR Angel would like to say F U to the egotistical bitch co-worker for making me work for her

972
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:59,880
tomorrow. Oh wait, more money for me. Well, still F U to her for being an egotistical

973
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:27,880
I'm doing the show by myself right now, apparently, because the others have more important things to watch.

974
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:32,880
Oh, Rob, I'm listening. I'm adding to the show, I think.

975
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,880
Oh, that was funny. Ha ha ha.

976
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:38,880
I'm kidding.

977
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,880
Hey, Rob, I think we should go to a break.

978
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,880
No, that's okay. I'm still waiting for one more F.U. to come in.

979
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:47,880
I'm just gonna wait one more time, and I'm gonna uncheck my world of pain all over your candy ass!

980
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:48,880
Ergo!

981
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,880
Feast of me, concordantly!

982
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:55,880
Justin?

983
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:56,880
Yeah?

984
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,880
I apologize.

985
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:33,840
So we'll be back after this potpourri of Bahmani music. Enjoy boys and girls.

986
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,200
I'm drunk and afraid from a little bit's diming

987
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:04,400
Who knows how to dance in such a timing

988
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:08,140
There's black lights starring no coke floor

989
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:08,640
So what?

990
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,640
A council fighter in a disco

991
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,000
He's out to take his chance

992
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,100
He knows the runny's in the house

993
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:14,340
Only coke for romance

994
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:14,980
What's the floor?

995
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:16,320
He's got a white suit on

996
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,240
Fight's passed on

997
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,980
And the night has just begun

998
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:21,060
It's when he lays it on with his style

999
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:22,960
A ladies mad with a nice smile

1000
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,900
The night before his eyes

He's a pretty old thing lookin' real swell

01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,400
He wants to make me score

1003

1004
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:32,660
He's even in line after line

1042
01:13:50,880 --> 01:14:00,880
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

1043
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,880
We are back, and you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1044
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:11,880
And Brad's flashing me liquor. He wants me to start drinking. You know, I already got pretty toasty last night.

1045
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,880
I don't know if I need to get drunk again. We'll see.

1046
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:19,880
I don't know.

1047
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,880
I don't know.

1048
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:25,880
I can have one. I'm not going to go outside. You know what, Brad, bring me one.

1049
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:30,880
I can have one. One will loosen me up a little bit. One or two or ten.

1050
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,880
Usually with Rob, one leads to two or four, eight, twenty-seven.

1051
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,880
Don't carry an open container in the car.

1052
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,880
Yeah, you can take one home with you.

1053
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,880
I don't want to drink something before I'm driving.

1054
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:46,880
I'm responsible.

1055
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,880
Don't drink and do radio, kids.

1056
01:14:58,880 --> 01:14:59,880
I'm not underage.

1057
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:01,880
If you're underage, you must have your parent's permission to drink.

1058
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:05,880
Although people at restaurants seem to think that I'm like 18.

1059
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,880
I don't look 18.

1060
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:12,320
Have you ever been carded in an R-rated movie?

1061
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:16,440
Yes. That shit would piss me off. How did you

1062
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:20,000
you look like... Oh! What? Oh!

1063
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,120
I have good news. Uh-oh. This is more centered toward

1064
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:27,840
Loki. Remember when we went to see The Matrix?

1065
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:32,080
And remember that crap with the thing and the credits? Guess what?

1066
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:36,960
I got six bucks from the movie theater

1067
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:43,100
And a two dollar off coupon. How'd you get six bucks? I gave them my ticket and told them what happened

1068
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:46,680
You should do that. You'll get money

1069
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:52,640
They turned on the lights and turned on and into the movie

1070
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,160
And then they turned it back on but didn't they turn the lights off

1071
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:03,200
You mean like before the trailer came on like during the credits of the end, right?

1072
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:07,200
Alright, so when Mara and Sean was in town, we went to see X-Men 2.

1073
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:13,200
And so I was just thinking, you know, so I have that ticket, and I personally wonder if they would, you know, give me like a movie pass or something.

1074
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:18,200
So I went and told them about it, and they gave me money off of another movie ticket, and then they gave me money.

1075
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,200
Cool.

1076
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:22,200
I'm like, okay, you should totally take your ticket there.

1077
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:25,200
It's like we never saw the movie because they never tore our tickets.

1078
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:31,200
Yeah, we just walked right by them because we got their, like, I guess there was this, what happened was we were thinking,

1079
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:35,800
I was thinking of getting fan dango tickets the night before, buying one line but I was

1080
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,160
like, you know what, maybe there will be– I don't know.

1081
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:41,580
I don't want to wait in line at a huge line if a whole bunch of people bought fandango

1082
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:42,580
tickets or whatever.

1083
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:45,580
Because then you have to wait in a fandango tickets, or whatever, you know?

1084
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:49,340
I went there early and there have to be two other showings happening that weren't pulled

1085
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:51,340
the night before.

1086
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,160
We got these two howings that nobody had tickets for because everybody bought fandango tickets.

1087
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:58,260
And so we went in there, and there was no, what do you call the person who PLAYED THE

1088
01:16:58,260 --> 01:16:55,940
PHOTOGRAPHER SO

1089
01:16:55,940 --> 01:17:00,940
And there was no, what do you call them, the person who, the chauffeur taking the tickets.

1090
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:06,940
So we just walked in there. We could have like, I don't know, probably gone and seen another movie or, I'm sure that's what you call them.

1091
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:11,940
Gotten chauffeur. Yeah, thanks James or Jeeves or whatever.

1092
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:15,940
So I don't know, we could probably have sold the tickets, I don't know.

1093
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:27,940
You can't use it for a new movie, but any movie that's already out.

1094
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:35,940
But it's a 2, or a 1 car.

1095
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:42,940
Anyway, moving right along, do we want to get in the cage match or does anybody else have something they want to say?

1096
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:47,940
Do you not have a song still? Because your song is first, buddy.

1097
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:51,940
No, I don't have anything yet.

1098
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:54,940
I thought you had the vinyl you wanted to do.

1099
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:57,940
I did?

1100
01:17:57,940 --> 01:17:59,940
Oh, yeah.

1101
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:00,940
You gonna do that?

1102
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:01,940
Yeah, I'll do that.

1103
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:02,940
All right.

1104
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:04,940
You have first, bud, so get that vinyl out.

1105
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:06,940
Sounds a lot crazier than...

1106
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:08,940
You know what they have in Ragnarok?

1107
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:09,940
What do they have in Ragnarok?

1108
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:10,940
The two hats.

1109
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:11,940

That's it. It's gone. So, all right. That was Mona Lisa Overdrive and it's out. So,

01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:56,120
participate. Do you need a little more time, Loki? Because I have some late FUs I can read.

1127
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,120
He needs a little more time, so I'm gonna read some late FUs.

1128
01:19:58,120 --> 01:19:59,120
Oh, you're good?

1129
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,120
Well, I need to do these anyways. I'm gonna read some late FUs.

1130
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:05,120
So, late FUs. Shame on you for being late.

1131
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:09,120
Alright, I have way too much fun with those sound clips.

1132
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:12,120
Okay, um, late FUs.

1133
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:16,120
From Nintz, FU to my connection, because I didn't get to hear my first FU.

1134
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:17,120
What?

1135
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,120
Because I take my socks off a little.

1136
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,120
A lot.

1137
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,120
Anyway.

1138
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:36,960
I have to go through a proxy server to access the chatroom.

1139
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,720
ISPs are dumb that block sites.

1140
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:40,880
F you to not having broadband.

1141
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:44,440
I'm actually sad now that I'm leaving high school so F you to heading out to real life.

1142
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,720
It's been great hanging out with all you great people but now we're going to go our separate

1143
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:48,720
way.

1144
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:49,720
Aww.

1145
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:55,720
F you to the people at the LAN party yesterday who just wanted to play the fastest map possible on Starcraft.

1146
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:59,720
You're dumb. Stop using noobs maps and try to beat me because you don't know how to play a strategy game.

1147
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:03,720
And F you to them at Counter Strike. Just using the AWP shows you have no skill.

1148
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:07,720
Girls, please, I'm begging you, will you please stop ignoring me when I talk to you, please?

1149
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:10,720
Don't talk to me when I'm doing F you. I'm done now.

1150
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:11,720
Give me a tool case.

1151
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:12,720
You want a tool case?

1152
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,720
Or a sleeve or something.

1153
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,720
Like a big one or a little one?

1154
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:17,720
Little one.

1155
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:19,720
I don't know where one is. Over here, you guys.

1156
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:21,720
How about here?

1157
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:28,720
Alright. So, back to the cage match.

1158
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,720
I love that sound effect. Alright.

1159
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:42,720
This week in the Orange Launch Cage Match, now that Mona Lisa Overdrive has been retired, Loki's up first. Loki, tell us about your pick! This should be great.

1160
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:50,680
This is from our girlfriend because she loves Donna Summers and it's the song, I'd say that

1161
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:57,560
Donna Summers is like, well obviously she'd be like the erotic, like the 70's and stuff,

1162
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:58,560
70's age.

1163
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,960
Anyways, this song is Love to Love You Baby.

1164
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,340
I believe it's been featured in a few movies and stuff.

1165
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:08,840
It's also not one of my stronger picks because you know, I gotta give the other people some

1166
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:15,880
chance you know so here we go love to love you baby all right here it is love

1167
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,880
Love you, baby

1168
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:47,880
You're breathing with me

1169
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,880
Yeah, oh

1170
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:53,880
I love you like a baby

1171
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:58,880
I love you like a baby

1172
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:03,880
I love you like a baby

1173
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,880
Do it to me again and again

1174
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,880
You put me in sunshine

1175
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:09,880
I put skin in my skin

1176
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,880
Oh

1177
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:14,680
Oh, I'd love to love you, baby

1178
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,600
I'd love to love you, baby

1179
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:23,800
Oh, I'd love to love you, baby

1180
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:29,320
Oh, I'd love to love you, baby

1181
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:34,120
Oh, I'd love to love you, baby

1182
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:38,600
Oh, oh I'd love to love you, baby

1183
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:43,600
70 baby, 80 baby, 90 baby given that whole life

1184
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:49,600
90 baby, 100 baby baby, 100 baby baby baby

1185
01:25:49,600 --> 01:26:08,620
Yay!

1186
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:38,340
I like Donna Summer, she did a good version of MacArthur Park, which was later parodied

1187
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:49,100
into Jurassic Park, and she did Bad Girls, remember, she did Bad Girls?

1188
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:50,100
Second Mix.

1189
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:51,100
Yup.

1190
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:54,860
Well, her version wasn't in Second Mix, but she did Bad Girls.

1191
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:55,860
But anyway.

1192
01:26:55,860 --> 01:27:00,780
But that song, you can't disco to it, okay, it's only, and it's too slow to get like a

1193
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:07,780
good, you know, you know, set music, hello, did you not notice the moaning in the background?

1194
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:11,780
But that would not be any good for sex either. It's too slow.

1195
01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:16,780
It's good for anal music. Studio 54 music, eh? Right?

1196
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:19,780
Cause back then that's what they listened to in their effects, right?

1197
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:23,780
Okay, the only thing that would make that good for like...

1198
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:27,780
Like even... What were you saying it was good for? Anal?

1199
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:28,780
Yeah.

1200
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:30,780
If the person was constipated.

1201
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:32,780
Okay.

1202
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:35,780
On a station one to... On a station. On a scale of one to ten?

1203
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:42,780
Three. Just because it gets a little bit of good because Donna Summer has a very nice voice.

1204
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:43,780
Yes she does.

1205
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:45,780
But her moaning needs to go.

1206
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:48,780
Uh, Lanky style. Your thoughts?

1207
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:51,780
Oh, I'm here.

1208
01:27:51,780 --> 01:28:02,780
My rating for it probably has like a song. I give it, you know, for what it does in its genre. I think it's pretty good. It's eight.

1209
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:07,780
But for being on our station, I give it a 2. It should not be on Orange Lounge.

1210
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:09,780
Poo!

1211
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:10,780
Alright.

1212
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:11,780
Poo that.

1213
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:13,780
Rice Princess.

1214
01:28:16,780 --> 01:28:19,780
This song sucks. It was way boring.

1215
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:21,780
Loki!

1216
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:23,780
What did you do to my chair?

1217
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:24,780
It's like all breaking.

1218
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:28,780
Anyways...

1219
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:35,780
Um, I give it an 8, because it's the best damn sex music that's on this record.

1220
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:41,780
And, uh, you have to understand, it's sex making out music, it's not meant to be dancing.

1221
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:43,780
You don't dance while you're supposed to be having sex.

1222
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:46,780
That's just like wanting to watch TV instead of having sex.

1223
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:51,780
Well, that's different, okay? That had more of an upbeat to it, okay?

1224
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:55,780
And they knew that they were there to dance and fuck. I mean, it's like Studio 54.

1225
01:28:55,780 --> 01:29:07,020
before. I have two words for that song. It's not a word, it's a sound clip. I'd rather

1226
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:12,260
listen to the Dance Dance Fuck music than that. No, it was okay. That's what my next

1227
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:18,900
week's cage match pick is going to be. The moaning was cool, I'll give it that, but otherwise

1228
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:23,400
I'm glad that I no longer have the crappiest cage match pick in Orange Lounge history,

1229
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,400
So thank you for that.

1230
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:28,480
So for that I give you, I won't give you a one, I'll give you a two.

1231
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:32,680
I didn't even try to find bad, if you want me to find bad, oh man, that's alright, that's

1232
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:33,680
alright.

1233
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:36,360
Alright, speaking of my pick, let's get to my pick for this week.

1234
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:42,120
This is a little trancy song, this is an artist that was suggested to me on the Sacromani

1235
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:47,620
boards, so thank you for the suggestion, I like this song, I like this artist, and hopefully

1236
01:29:47,620 --> 01:29:48,620
all you do too.

1237
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:54,820
This is this is my cage match picks of the pick of the week. This is know me with you. Enjoy

1238
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:25,620
I lay my hand on you, you

1239
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:34,620
If I never understand my jealousy Don't cover your eyes and the color inside your heart

1240
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:40,620
If I ever say to you without calling me

1241
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:48,620
I'm gonna search up for what I've got reasons to live apart

1242
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:54,620
You, nothing but you

1243
01:31:54,620 --> 01:32:02,620
The reason for living, I lay my love on you

1244
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:08,420
You, nothing but you

1245
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:11,620
But come to me

1246
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:15,620
I lay my hand on you

1247
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:19,620
You

1248
01:33:15,620 --> 01:33:30,620
Nothing but you, they're even for living I lay my love on you, you

1249
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:33,620
Nothing but you

1250
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:37,620
The calling you've been

1251
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:41,620
I lay my hand on you

1252
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:43,620
You

1253
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:50,660
All right that was

1254
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:53,760
My pick for the case match this week that was know me with you

1255
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:56,880
And I don't think anyone in here was listening, but I listen let's see anyway

1256
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:01,760
It was boring Jamie would you thought it was boring because I need to sleep it gets so it's pretty

1257
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:09,440
So it gets like a seven, but it made me sleepy. I made you sleepy all right anyone else want to comment on know me you

1258
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:14,440
Eh. Eh, three. It was kind of boring.

1259
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:19,440
Place some good stuff on there.

1260
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,440
Alright, Brad.

1261
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:26,440
What are you talking about playing good stuff? Orange Lounge means crap.

1262
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:29,440
Crap radio, crap music. Thanks for listening, everybody.

1263
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:34,440
Um, doing alright. This is mediocre. I'd say seven.

1264
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:44,440
It was okay. It started off good for like 5 seconds. Damn, my poster is all fucked up!

1265
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:52,440
So then, yeah, it was alright. It was like, I don't know, 5 I guess.

1266
01:34:52,440 --> 01:35:00,440
I was just gonna say, they're lucky that I played the Donna Summer song because Rob was suggesting that I play Party All Time by Eddie Murphy.

1267
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:04,440
Eddie Murphy, so I'd be glad. I have plenty of other really shitty records that I could have played.

1268
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:13,440
My song was fabulous, as it always is, and it'll be the sleeper hit of Orange Lounge 2003 gets a 10.

1269
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:15,440
Next!

1270
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:19,440
Alright, next. Jamie, would you be kind enough to intro your pick for us?

1271
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:22,440
Fantastic Plastic Machine would take me to the disco.

1272
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:24,440
And what else did they do?

1273
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:29,440
They did Beautiful Days and BeatMania CDX. Buy their album, it's called Beautiful, it's released in the US.

1274
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:33,600

Take me to the disco, take me to the disco

1291
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:20,760
Dancing at the disco at the end of the world

1292
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:30,260
Alright, a fantastic plastic machine with disco at the end of the world.

1293
01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:32,260
Let's hear what folks thought.

1294
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:36,760
I'll have to bring you a copy of the original, um, Take Me to the Disco.

1295
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:40,260
Just because it's like, you'll hear what parts they took to make that.

1296
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:45,260
It's like a weird remix of the song, which, for me, I think this is kind of neat to play Ragnarok to that music.

1297
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:50,260
So, I give it an 8 myself, just because it's one of my neat little things I listen to when I'm bored.

1298
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:53,260
Alrighty. Mike, you sound?

1299
01:40:53,260 --> 01:41:02,260
Um, hard to say. Maybe it's just a little too repetitive for me, so I'd have to probably give it, like, a 6.

1300
01:41:02,260 --> 01:41:09,260
And also, you know, Beautiful Days is so much better than that song. I guess I've been jaded by that song.

1301
01:41:09,260 --> 01:41:11,260
Bryce Princess.

1302
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:17,260
It was way better than the crap that you played the last two songs, so I give it a 7.

1303
01:41:17,260 --> 01:41:19,260
Alright, Loki.

1304
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:21,260
Eh.

1305
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:24,260
And on a scale of 1 to 10.

1306
01:41:24,260 --> 01:41:26,260
Eh.

1307
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:32,260
Alright, um, I found myself bopping my head to it a little bit, kind of like a Night at the Rock's Berry type thing, so that was pretty cool.

1308
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:36,260
I agree it did get maybe a little bit repetitive, but not too bad.

1309
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:41,260
I don't know. I could put up with it. I could put up for maybe three minutes of it, just not four.

1310
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:47,260
But it was still pretty cool, so I give it a... I give it an eight. Why not?

1311
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:56,260
Okay, so let's run through the three songs you can vote for one more time, and then you can send your votes in over private message to Skye in the chat room.

1312
01:41:56,260 --> 01:42:03,260
Here they are. You can vote for Donna Summer with... What the hell was that called?

1313
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:10,260
I'd love to love you, baby. Play a little clip for me. Just drop it in the middle and it starts.

1314
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:16,260
Here we go. Oh yeah.

1315
01:42:18,260 --> 01:42:23,260
Alright, that's Donna Summer with Love to Love You Baby. Or you can vote for Nomi with You.

1316
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:34,580
or you can vote for a fantastic plastic machine with disco at the end of the world

1317
01:42:34,580 --> 01:42:48,740
alright so there they are send in your votes now

1318
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:52,580
the voting is open now so send those votes to Skye in the chat room

1319
01:42:52,580 --> 01:43:00,580
Write in candidates for a song that was not played as one of those three will be thrown out and you cannot vote again and we will taunt you and make fun of you openly on the show.

1320
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:03,580
And then we'll find you and start drawing on you.

1321
01:43:03,580 --> 01:43:06,580
We will wiggle our private parts in your general direction.

1322
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:10,580
Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries.

1323
01:43:10,580 --> 01:43:15,580
And don't threaten to not vote for anything because we've already gotten one vote so we have a winner either way.

1324
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:19,580
So if it comes down to one vote then I guess it'll be a one vote win.

1325
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:26,580
Fine by me. Because we're evil dictators, and we always get our way.

1326
01:43:26,580 --> 01:43:29,580
Either evil dictators or just evil dicks, I don't know.

1327
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:31,580
That's right.

1328
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:33,580
Okay, so...

1329
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:36,580
Rob, by the way, you need to get rid of the Furby, okay?

1330
01:43:36,580 --> 01:43:38,580
The Furby? I love my Furby!

1331
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:40,580
You need to put the Furby in the back.

1332
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:43,580
My Furby's cool.

1333
01:43:43,580 --> 01:43:46,580
Yes! Give me!

1334
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:48,580
Oh no.

1335
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:50,580
Now the ferret's coming.

1336
01:43:50,580 --> 01:43:52,580
It was the coyote.

1337
01:43:52,580 --> 01:43:54,580
The coyote?

1338
01:43:54,580 --> 01:43:56,580
Yeah, it's like the desert dog.

1339
01:43:56,580 --> 01:43:58,580
It's the ferret coyote.

1340
01:43:58,580 --> 01:44:00,580
Very interesting.

1341
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:11,580
I have to stop drinking now because I have to run to the store after the show's over.

1342
01:44:11,580 --> 01:44:13,580
Aww.

1343
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:20,580
I know, I've only had one, I've only had half a bottle, but I need to stop, I need to let my system process it, so.

1344
01:44:20,580 --> 01:44:22,580
Hey, let's, let's do listless.

1345
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:26,580
Let's do listless? We can't, um, we gotta find paper and pencil, which I don't know.

1346
01:44:26,580 --> 01:44:28,580
So let's do a quick break while we find paper and pencil.

1347
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:31,580
We gotta, we just braked with a bunch of music, so I feel like we've gotta talk about something.

1348
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:32,580
I'll find paper!

1349
01:44:32,580 --> 01:44:34,580
We gotta talk about something.

1350
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:36,580
Where?

1351
01:44:36,580 --> 01:44:39,580
Where all the printer paper is in the box, there's printer paper.

1352
01:44:39,580 --> 01:44:40,580
Oh!

1353
01:44:40,580 --> 01:44:41,580
Yay!

1354
01:44:41,580 --> 01:44:55,420
I have something I do want to talk about because I haven't been to Scandia yet since they've

1355
01:44:55,420 --> 01:45:01,160
done this, but apparently, and I never knew this about 2DX machines, but, and I wish Brad

1356
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:04,480
was here to hear it, but he's not, that's fine.

1357
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:08,440
The thing about 2DX machines, I guess, is that they have like an S video output and

1358
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:10,360
a VGA output.

1359
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:13,360
And for the longest time at Scandi in Sacramento, where

1360
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:16,400
Orange Lounge is headquartered in Sacramento, they've been

1361
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:18,320
using S-Video, and it's been kind of blurry.

1362
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:19,240
I mean, it's been playable.

1363
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:21,200
It's been very playable, but a little bit blurry.

1364
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:23,120
You don't get quite that crystal clearness that you get

1365
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:24,960
when you play it at home.

1366
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:27,480
But now they've switched over to VGA, and I guess a lot of

1367
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:29,000
people really like the differences.

1368
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,080
So I haven't seen the differences myself, but what

1369
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:33,920
do you guys think of it, like the difference

1370
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:35,240
between S-Video and VGA?

1371
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:37,720
It's nice to be able to see everything, like all the

1372
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:41,440
options you picked and stuff like that you know like light 770 and stuff like

1373
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:47,800
that it's a bit bright for me I don't know maybe I'm just I thought maybe it

1374
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:51,240
was darker before but it was just a little bit brighter for me but otherwise

1375
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:55,720
you know it's kind of the same for me I guess I don't really notice that kind of

1376
01:45:55,720 --> 01:46:00,280
stuff you know too much so it makes no difference when you're playing at higher

1377
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:04,080
speed you can see your keys a lot clearly um the color needs a little bit

1378
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:09,080
It's not as bad as, say, like, AI's machine was before, you know, with the discoloration.

1379
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:17,080
It's just slightly off, like, the contrast needs to be adjusted, but since the menus are all in Japanese, it might be a little bit hard to read.

1380
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:19,080
They changed over, yeah.

1381
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:22,080
Am I the only person who notices that it looks better?

1382
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,080
Yeah, I've noticed it better.

1383
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:26,080
Okay, I just, all I've...

1384
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:32,080
I'm sorry, I just came out of the bathroom, so I missed something, but it looks like everybody I've seen so far has said that it looks like crap.

1385
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:35,800
it's been like really discolored and stuff you know I think before it was

1386
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:40,200
discolored now it looks clear I can play almost anything on high-speed 3 with

1387
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:44,800
like no problem except of course like stocks are at max 300 and stuff I mean

1388
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:49,000
it looks way better I don't know I miss I'm weird even on a high speed it looks

1389
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,240
great

1390
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:56,920
played lab during the last break yeah we already heard about the labs good so

1391
01:46:56,920 --> 01:47:00,920
Play it again.

1392
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:02,920
No.

1393
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:06,920
Although the act from night is pretty much just lab.

1394
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:10,920
It's got like a kind of a, well not a similar video.

1395
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,920
It's like an anime girl like running.

1396
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:14,920
Like a CG anime-ish girl.

1397
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:16,920
It's pretty cool.

1398
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:18,920
Hey I've already had to throw out two votes for cage match.

1399
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:20,920
Pretty cool huh?

1400
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:21,920
Any reason why?

1401
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:23,920
Yes, they both voted for Rob's voice to game.

1402
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:27,920
There's such a retard.

1403
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:30,920
Oh, was that my outside world talking? I'm sorry.

1404
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:33,920
You know we have some listeners who are some real retards.

1405
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:37,920
We love you.

1406
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:39,920
We love you, but you lose.

1407
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:40,920
Rules are rules.

1408
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:43,920
Exactly, we love you like our retarded children.

1409
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:46,920
You know, we have to love you.

1410
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:48,920
The state says we have to.

1411
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:50,920
You keep it in the attic?

1412
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:53,760
They're the special ones we keep in the attic.

1413
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:54,800
Or the basement.

1414
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:57,600
But we take them out of the basement when it rains.

1415
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:01,080
Because, you know, if they get sick, then we have to sort of take them to the doctor and...

1416
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:04,640
Oh, but when they say something! Oh.

1417
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:08,560
I think the CDs are cool because you can see the spindles in them.

1418
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:11,300
All distorted-y. Anyway.

1419
01:48:11,300 --> 01:48:14,320
Ah, retarded kids are already broke, so I mean, we'll...

1420
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:19,800
We don't really take them anywhere. You can't really tell the difference, you know?

1421
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:29,800
Especially if you have, like, any blows to the head or anything, you know, and, you know, think that they might give you damage and you're shook, then you forgot, and you're like, oh, that's right, that was like that before you got hit in the head.

1422
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:32,800
Now the chat room's getting defensive.

1423
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:39,800
Since when did you guys start taking things we say seriously? Seriously, you guys, seriously. Don't take things seriously.

1424
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:46,800
Look at the cow, look at the cow, it says bark, bark, bark. Woo! It's bark cow!

1425
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:49,800
I don't know, I think it's the upstairs, uh, I think it's the upstairs neighbors.

1426
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:52,800
Our neighbors are pissed at us because we're making retarded jokes.

1427
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:54,800
They didn't like those cage mat pics either.

1428
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:55,800
Yeah, exactly.

1429
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:59,800
Okay, well they've been like totally banging on the like ceiling.

1430
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:05,800
I don't know, like, earlier today it sounded like someone jumped off the couch or whatever and landed on a floor.

1431
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:07,800
I don't know what they're doing upstairs, but.

1432
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:09,800
Isn't that like an older lady? Like a 60 year old?

1433
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:11,800
It's an older lady and her daughter.

1434
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:12,800
Is she having sex or something?

1435
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:13,800
No, it's her daughter.

1436
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:16,800
No, it's a normal lady and her daughter, I think it's their daughter.

1437
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,800
But like, I hear hanging on the walls all the time.

1438
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:19,800
Really? You ever see they live?

1439
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,800
Yeah, that's awesome.

1440
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:24,800
Wasn't it the one with the cat? No, that wasn't with the aliens.

1441
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,800
Kinda, yeah.

1442
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:27,800
All I'm saying is-

1443
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:29,800
All the cats could see that they were aliens?

1444
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:30,800
No, no, no.

1445
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:31,800
What was busy was that?

1446
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:32,800
No, it wasn't Cat's Eye.

1447
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:37,800
All I'm saying is they can go suck it because it's before 10 and, you know, yeah.

1448
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:40,800
Invaders from Mars?

1449
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:41,800
Mike, please.

1450
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:42,800
What?

1451
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:48,800
We were talking about, that was the one with the spheres, they take the energy out of their body.

1452
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:52,800
I mean, I haven't seen that movie in forever, and I couldn't remember what that movie was, thank you.

1453
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:58,800
But no, this was a different movie with the mother and her son, and they were, like, fucking...

1454
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:08,800
The cats could see that they were really alien or demon or something, and then the cats killed them in the movie.

1455
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:11,800
Oh, Dark Tetsuya had a good idea.

1456
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:12,800
What?

1457
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:15,800
It says that the upstairs folks might be playing world-class track meet.

1458
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:18,800
You remember on the Nintendo?

1459
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:20,800
No, they're playing Dance Aerobics.

1460
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:22,800
Woot woot, Dark Tetsuya.

1461
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:24,800
I think he gets an honorary zing for that.

1462
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:25,800
That was like a half zing.

1463
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:28,800
That was a Z.

1464
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:31,800
He gets a coyote.

1465
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:34,800
He gets a non-retardant.

1466
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:37,800
He's our official non-retardant.

1467
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:40,800
The rest of you are retards, but this is cool.

1468
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:42,800
Happy Ferret!

1469
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:46,800
I'm here to chew bubblegum and that's all.

1470
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:51,800
And I'm all out of bubblegum, so I'm not doing anything. Goodbye.

1471
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:59,800
God, I will never forget in Nintendo Power when they had that segment on like the kids who were having the slumber party and playing the Power Pad game or whatever.

1472
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:06,800
They had like the red team and the yellow team and they were playing. Remember it was like this highlight on the Power Pad and kids having fun?

1473
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:08,800
Sorry, I wasn't a dork.

1474
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:12,800
Come on, come on, surely somebody remembers that. Surely.

1475
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:17,800
I remember you telling me about submitting to be in some video game.

1476
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:18,800
You submitted-

1477
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:19,800
Shut up.

1478
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:21,800
You're a dork.

1479
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:22,800
Dude.

1480
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,800
You're such a dork.

1481
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:26,800
I wish we could get a power pad.

1482
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:27,800
I remember Howard and Esther.

1483
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:28,800
Do you have a power pad, Jamie?

1484
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:29,800
Yes, I do.

1485
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:32,800
You need to bring that shit over and we should have a world class track needed.

1486
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:33,800
No, Rob.

1487
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:34,800
Rob?

1488
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:35,800
No.

1489
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:36,800
No?

1490
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:37,800
I'll bring over the power glove.

1491
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:38,800
It's so bad.

1492
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:41,800
No, I remember Howard and Esther.

1493
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:46,800
Actually, I'll try to find it. There's an archive that has almost every Howard and Nester comic online.

1494
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:49,800
I remember seeing that somewhere. You pointed it to me before, I think.

1495
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:50,800
Long ass time ago.

1496
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:51,800
Long ass time ago.

1497
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:53,800
But I remember the Mega Man ones.

1498
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:06,800
I like that Howard and Nester ones, but I want to find somebody who has scans of all the Zelda comics that were in the Nintendo Power,

1499
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:10,800
because those were cool. And the Metroid ones, and the Star Fox ones, because they were all cool.

1500
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,300
I think I have an archive that has the Zelda ones.

1501
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:16,300
I still need to download episodes of the Zelda cartoon.

1502
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:18,300
Well, excuse me, princess!

1503
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:23,300
I remember, I had, before my computer died, I had the, um, the one where he was invisible.

1504
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:25,800
When he, like, stands up in the middle of Ganon's chamber and goes,

1505
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:27,300
Zelda loves me! Zelda loves me!

1506
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:28,800
And then they all get shot at.

1507
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:34,300
Yay! Quiet!

1508
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:36,800
Sorry, we're gossiping.

1509
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:39,800
Well, stop gossiping, dammit!

1510
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:41,800
It's all about you too, bitch

1511
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:49,720
What yeah this yeah, I can I suppose if I have to

1512
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:52,480
Yeah a little bit

1513
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:54,400
We need to be loud

1514
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:58,280
Okay, we're gonna take a break and when we come back. We're gonna have listless. I

1515
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:04,200
Didn't know they had a monkey pox virus. That's funny. Yeah, I was reading about that on AOL

1516
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:09,320
They showed a picture of a prairie dog on there and the prairie dog like it was like the prairie dog of Satan

1517
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:11,320
You are Monkey Pox!

1518
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:13,320
It was making this face, Rob.

1519
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:15,320
It was like-

1520
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:17,320
It was like-

1521
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:19,320
It was like-

1522
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:21,320
For the second quarter of 2003, yes,

1523
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:23,320
Monkey Pox will be the official virus

1524
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:25,320
of Orange Challenge Radio.

1525
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:27,320
Is it replacing SARS?

1526
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:29,320
Yes it is.

1527
01:53:29,320 --> 01:53:31,320
So now Rob,

1528
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:33,320
do you have Monkey Pox?

1529
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:35,320
Monkey Pox!

1530
01:53:35,320 --> 01:53:37,320
Monkey Pox!

1531
01:53:37,320 --> 01:53:50,560
OK, well then, I guess on that note, why don't we head off to break, and when we come back,

1532
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:55,240
we will announce this week's cage match winner, so this is your last chance to submit a vote,

1533
01:53:55,240 --> 01:54:02,200
unless you've already been disqualified, and when we come back, more show, and list lists,

1534
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:05,120
so we're going to take up a chance to prepare our list lists for tonight.

1535
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:06,580
So we'll be back.

1536
01:54:06,580 --> 01:54:07,580
And on that note...

1537
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:52,580
Are you ready to dance into the night?

1538
01:54:52,580 --> 01:54:55,580
Letting go of your body was right there

1539
01:54:55,580 --> 01:54:58,580
You should reach on back

1540
01:54:58,580 --> 01:55:00,580
Under the moonlight

1541
01:55:00,580 --> 01:55:07,580
Love what lies, love what is evil, love what's me, I don't know why

1542
01:55:07,580 --> 01:55:13,580
Do and ask them these rules, pull yourself apart is what you need

1543
01:55:13,580 --> 01:55:18,580
Monkey dance, monkey dance, like a star

1544
01:55:18,580 --> 01:55:21,580
Shake your body down, step on the monkey stand

1545

Let's dance together, hold on to your favorite hand

Look at this kill, this is a resolution

Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:01:20,180 --> 02:01:25,180
We are live, and I bet you're all dying to know who won tonight's cage match.

1554
02:01:25,180 --> 02:01:26,180
Yay.

Well, here it is, kids. Tonight's cage match winner is...

Drum roll, please.

1557
02:01:33,180 --> 02:01:43,180
It's a fantastic classic machine with disco at the end of the world.

1558
02:01:43,180 --> 02:01:45,180
It makes me want to shake my bootay.

1559
02:01:45,180 --> 02:01:46,180
What?

1560
02:01:46,180 --> 02:01:48,180
It makes me want to shake my bootay.

1561
02:01:48,180 --> 02:01:49,180
Shake your bootay.

1562
02:01:49,180 --> 02:01:50,180
So there it is.

1563
02:01:50,180 --> 02:01:51,180
Thank you for playing.

1564
02:01:51,180 --> 02:01:52,180
Hah!

1565
02:01:52,180 --> 02:01:53,180
No more Matrix!

1566
02:01:53,180 --> 02:01:54,180
Hah!

1567
02:01:54,180 --> 02:02:02,180
I didn't enter the Matrix into the frickin' contest.

1568
02:02:02,180 --> 02:02:04,180
My song would have been gone this week anyways.

1569
02:02:04,180 --> 02:02:06,180
So there.

1570
02:02:06,180 --> 02:02:08,180
I have had a sniff.

1571
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:10,180
Alright.

1572
02:02:10,180 --> 02:02:14,180
So, um, what we decided to do this segment, Brad went out to go run an errand.

1573
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:17,180
So, we're gonna hold off on listless until the next segment.

1574
02:02:17,180 --> 02:02:20,180
But, guess what we have tonight everybody. Are you ready, Irene?

1575
02:02:20,180 --> 02:02:22,180
Okay.

1576
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:24,180
Lowkey, you're gonna have to be the timer since there's nobody else here.

1577
02:02:24,180 --> 02:02:26,180
So, you ready for this too?

1578
02:02:26,180 --> 02:02:28,180
You have to be a timer. Can you time 30 seconds?

1579
02:02:28,180 --> 02:02:30,180
Uh, I think I can.

1580
02:02:30,180 --> 02:02:35,180
Alright, good. Alright, hold on. I have to queue up the music here.

1581
02:02:35,180 --> 02:02:40,180
Hold on. Sorry.

1582
02:02:40,180 --> 02:02:45,180
I'm having a little problem finding the music. You know what? I need to put all the theme songs

1583
02:02:45,180 --> 02:02:50,180
like in a separate folder. Because my drive, if you haven't already

1584
02:02:50,180 --> 02:02:55,180
figured it out, is very dirty.

1585
02:02:55,180 --> 02:03:22,180

Since your first answer was incorrect, that one doesn't count, the first question.

Oh, come on.

1637
02:06:20,140 --> 02:06:24,140

Oh, goodie.

1639

Do we have to get Jamie in here too or?

1643
02:06:29,140 --> 02:06:30,140
Yeah, Jamie can come out.

1644
02:06:30,140 --> 02:06:31,140
Okay.

1645
02:06:31,140 --> 02:06:32,140
So you got a half a point.

1646
02:06:32,140 --> 02:06:34,420
Wait, I got a half point overall?

1647
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:35,420
Yeah.

1648
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:36,420
That sucks!

1649
02:06:36,420 --> 02:06:37,420
Yeah.

1650
02:06:37,420 --> 02:06:38,420
I don't like this game.

1651
02:06:38,420 --> 02:06:39,420
Wah.

1652
02:06:39,420 --> 02:06:40,420
I don't like games where Jamie beats me.

1653
02:06:40,420 --> 02:06:41,420
You're the only one.

1654
02:06:41,420 --> 02:06:43,420
You're the only one that doesn't like it.

1655
02:06:43,420 --> 02:06:46,740
You're like, Jamie, it's time to come out now.

1656
02:06:46,740 --> 02:06:48,820
Okay, is she up?

1657
02:06:48,820 --> 02:06:51,260
No, I think she's, you know.

1658
02:06:51,260 --> 02:06:52,260
Uh oh.

1659
02:06:52,260 --> 02:06:56,260
okay should I just

1660
02:06:56,260 --> 02:06:59,740
I don't know sure why not okay

1661
02:06:59,740 --> 02:07:04,060
well first question how old is she and where was she born she's 27 years old

1662
02:07:04,060 --> 02:07:07,380
oh wow and she was born in Australia but you said

1663
02:07:07,380 --> 02:07:10,460
Come on! You said Ireland or something first. I changed it.

1664
02:07:10,460 --> 02:07:14,340
Wham! Come on! My clit hurts. Is that the one she...

1665
02:07:14,340 --> 02:07:17,460
Fine I'll make it one you're still fine. Is that the one she got right?

1666
02:07:17,460 --> 02:07:21,380
No. Okay did you hear that Jamie? I threw a fit

1667
02:07:21,380 --> 02:07:24,860
Because I said Ireland at first for the first question, then I'm like, no, wait, Australia.

1668
02:07:24,860 --> 02:07:26,460
So I made I made her give it to me.

1669
02:07:27,260 --> 02:07:32,660
Okay. I know I was, he got one point anyway, and you got one point.

1670
02:07:32,660 --> 02:07:33,780
So you guys are tied anyway.

1671
02:07:33,780 --> 02:07:35,060
He would have gotten a half point.

1672
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:36,420
Because I guess whatever.

1673
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:37,620
I guess 27.

1674
02:07:37,660 --> 02:07:39,500
Anyway, yeah, so she's 27 years old.

1675
02:07:39,500 --> 02:07:40,940
And she's born in Australia.

1676
02:07:41,260 --> 02:07:45,060
Her mother is an opera singer, a famous opera singer at that.

1677
02:07:45,340 --> 02:07:47,140
Okay, and the acid jazz band.

1678
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:52,240
she's a part of it's called cracker jam because she's white I guess her alter

1679
02:07:52,240 --> 02:08:01,940
egos naoki right close but no it's Sonia that's her alter egos name and she lived

1680
02:08:01,940 --> 02:08:10,540
oh god she lived in France until she was 16 I wonder she's just stupid oh god

1681
02:08:10,540 --> 02:08:14,860
yeah and other interesting fact she's married but she tells everyone she thought

1682
02:08:14,860 --> 02:08:21,860
Yeah, and she lives in Japan. Wow, that's it. That concludes another segment of Orange Crush.

1683
02:08:25,860 --> 02:08:29,860
Hold on, I have to get back to the computer so I can officially close out this segment.

1684
02:08:34,860 --> 02:08:35,860
That's like shitty Radio Rob.

1685
02:08:35,860 --> 02:08:50,860
That's the end of Orange Crush, Polteri really sucked on Orange Crush. One point for Rob, I don't care. Australia was the answer, not that country with red hair. Okay.

1686
02:08:50,860 --> 02:08:53,860
Okay.

1687
02:08:53,860 --> 02:08:54,860
I said Italy.

1688
02:08:54,860 --> 02:09:00,860
You said Italy?

1689
02:09:00,860 --> 02:09:06,860
I technically got one right because I said not polytary for her alter-ego.

1690
02:09:06,860 --> 02:09:07,860
Ah, true.

1691
02:09:07,860 --> 02:09:08,860
Aha!

1692
02:09:08,860 --> 02:09:09,860
Whatever.

1693
02:09:09,860 --> 02:09:13,780
So if you can get Australia, then I get not polytary.

1694
02:09:13,780 --> 02:09:14,780
You know what's your prize?

1695
02:09:14,780 --> 02:09:17,460
You get to listen to polytary music all night long.

1696
02:09:17,460 --> 02:09:18,460
You know what you can do?

1697
02:09:18,460 --> 02:09:19,460
Ah!

1698
02:09:19,460 --> 02:09:20,460
You know what you can do?

1699
02:09:20,460 --> 02:09:21,460
What?

1700
02:09:21,460 --> 02:09:22,460
Pick a key, please.

1701
02:09:22,460 --> 02:09:23,460
Pick a...

1702
02:09:23,460 --> 02:09:24,460
And stay in it.

1703
02:09:24,460 --> 02:09:39,460
So, did we learn something from tonight's Orange Crush segment?

1704
02:09:39,460 --> 02:09:44,900
It's actually kind of neat because now we know who to hold for ransom if we ever want

1705
02:09:44,900 --> 02:09:47,460
to have Paul Terry never sing again.

1706
02:09:47,460 --> 02:09:48,460
Excellent.

1707
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:51,620
Thank you Irene, that was cool.

1708
02:09:51,620 --> 02:09:53,780
I love the Orange Crush segment, Irene.

1709
02:09:53,780 --> 02:09:55,780
How do you do your research for that?

1710
02:09:55,780 --> 02:09:56,780
So that we know where to look.

1711
02:09:56,780 --> 02:09:59,780
On a mic. On a mic. On a mic.

1712
02:10:02,780 --> 02:10:04,780
Quiet! Wow!

1713
02:10:05,780 --> 02:10:07,780
It's so, so quiet.

1714
02:10:10,780 --> 02:10:13,780
You know what? I got my Bjork tickets today and I have to sell them.

1715
02:10:13,780 --> 02:10:14,780
Why?

1716
02:10:14,780 --> 02:10:16,780
Because I'm going to go to Cyberbeat Nation too.

1717
02:10:16,780 --> 02:10:18,780
I want to go.

1718
02:10:18,780 --> 02:10:19,780
Where's she playing?

1719
02:10:19,780 --> 02:10:20,780
You want to go to Bjork?

1720
02:10:20,780 --> 02:10:21,780
Yeah.

1721
02:10:21,780 --> 02:10:27,780
I can't afford to pay me kickbacks on the tickets because I'm probably going to have to get the cost 100 bucks for two.

1722
02:10:27,780 --> 02:10:32,780
Yeah, it's a lot. So, I'm probably going to put them on eBay if none of my friends take them.

1723
02:10:32,780 --> 02:10:35,780
Just because I need to make my money back so I have money to spend in L.A.

1724
02:10:35,780 --> 02:10:36,780
When's the concert?

1725
02:10:36,780 --> 02:10:37,780
It is August 8th.

1726
02:10:37,780 --> 02:10:38,780
Where?

1727
02:10:38,780 --> 02:10:41,780
And at Pier 3032 in San Francisco.

1728
02:10:41,780 --> 02:10:43,780
I can't go to that anyway.

1729
02:10:43,780 --> 02:10:44,780
Classic Gaming Expo?

1730
02:10:44,780 --> 02:10:47,780
Oh, that's right. Yep, you're going to be at the Classic Gaming Expo.

1731
02:10:47,780 --> 02:10:48,780
Did you already register for that?

1732
02:10:48,780 --> 02:10:49,780
No.

1733
02:10:49,780 --> 02:10:50,780
Oh.

1734
02:10:50,780 --> 02:10:51,780
You're just going to show up at the door and go,

1735
02:10:51,780 --> 02:10:52,780
Hey!

1736
02:10:52,780 --> 02:10:53,780
Um, I'll talk to Xander.

1737
02:10:53,780 --> 02:10:54,780
Hey!

1738
02:10:54,780 --> 02:10:57,780
I'll talk to Xander about it, because I can't get a fan of me.

1739
02:10:57,780 --> 02:11:00,780
I can't get a fan of me.

1740
02:11:00,780 --> 02:11:01,780
Like, I don't care.

1741
02:11:01,780 --> 02:11:02,780
No.

1742
02:11:02,780 --> 02:11:06,780
Well, it's just because, you know, what's the point of going if I can't cosplay, so.

1743
02:11:06,780 --> 02:11:10,780
Um, what else was I going to say?

1744
02:11:10,780 --> 02:11:11,780
I don't remember.

1745
02:11:11,780 --> 02:11:16,780
Um, upcoming, yeah, Cyberbeat Nation 2, there's this little teaser.

1746
02:11:16,780 --> 02:11:17,780
They've been teasing it online.

1747
02:11:17,780 --> 02:11:19,780
They have a little teaser trailer.

1748
02:11:19,780 --> 02:11:22,780
Excuse me, it's out. And it's pretty cool.

1749
02:11:22,780 --> 02:11:28,780
They hint at that there's going to be perfect attacks, singles and doubles this time around. That should be interesting.

1750
02:11:28,780 --> 02:11:35,780
And freestyle, if I read this teaser correctly, they're saying any Bamani song you want.

1751
02:11:35,780 --> 02:11:42,780
Which makes me think they're going to do freestyle on a sim. That's just a guess, though. But that's the only way you could do it, right?

1752
02:11:42,780 --> 02:11:44,780
It'll never happen.

1753
02:11:44,780 --> 02:11:46,780
Why is that?

1754
02:11:46,780 --> 02:11:50,780
Because they're too dumb to find actual sim files, they're synced up correctly and then you'll have people go,

1755
02:11:50,780 --> 02:11:52,780
What is that thing?

1756
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:55,780
Watch as you get an email in a couple of weeks.

1757
02:11:55,780 --> 02:11:58,780
Well, yeah, you're going to get an email. Hello, key help.

1758
02:11:58,780 --> 02:12:03,780
But actually, what if people were responsible for making their own sim files and bringing them in?

1759
02:12:03,780 --> 02:12:04,780
That's what I would have meant.

1760
02:12:04,780 --> 02:12:08,780
Oh my, that'll happen. That'll be awful.

1761
02:12:08,780 --> 02:12:13,780
If they're giving away another arcade machine, you can bet people will go to the distance to make it happen.

1762
02:12:13,780 --> 02:12:15,100
I think it could be successful.

1763
02:12:15,100 --> 02:12:18,980
Hell, at Shaft we ended up using a sim.

1764
02:12:18,980 --> 02:12:22,380
Because I'm cool and I'm the only one that can pull it off.

1765
02:12:22,380 --> 02:12:26,940
Only one anywhere that can pull it off.

1766
02:12:26,940 --> 02:12:29,900
No one will be able to do it except for me.

1767
02:12:29,900 --> 02:12:33,700
Me, me, me, me, me.

1768
02:12:33,700 --> 02:12:36,180
Oh, really now?

1769
02:12:36,180 --> 02:12:38,540
OK.

1770
02:12:38,540 --> 02:12:48,500
Segue into the Sims section. Okay, stuff that's going on. First off, you've got a

1771
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:52,740
couple sites, you know, going through redesigns, you have Maniacs that's updating the site

1772
02:12:52,740 --> 02:12:57,840
and it looks pretty. You've got Turning Mix 4, which is ending their submissions

1773
02:12:57,840 --> 02:13:02,180
in four days, so if you have, if you've registered already, which you must have

1774
02:13:02,180 --> 02:13:06,660
if you're joining up, have your file done in four days, because I needed to get my

1775
02:13:06,660 --> 02:13:12,440
file then four days is not yet also there's rumored to be about 400 entries

1776
02:13:12,440 --> 02:13:16,400
they've got about 10 judges so it looks pretty cool they're gonna be doing them

1777
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:22,200
like I believe release releasing a group of files every week and then voting on

1778
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:28,620
those and then new set will come up and so on and so forth other than that we've

1779
02:13:28,620 --> 02:13:35,960
got let's see a few fun sim files came out like a terrible mr. Grimshaw good

1780
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:43,620
check that one out for Monty Sims and really oh one more interesting bit of

1781
02:13:43,620 --> 02:13:47,300
information is not really sim related but it was on a sim site that I found it

1782
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:54,180
DDR UK there's this guy who goes by the name Havok on there and he like I just

1783
02:13:54,180 --> 02:13:58,380
like me he has copies of their arcade disc but since you know you've got the

1784
02:13:58,380 --> 02:14:03,860
UK arcade disc he's got a dancing stage Euromix 2 disc and what's funny is he

1785
02:14:03,860 --> 02:14:08,960
He found some songs on the disc that weren't in the actual game itself.

1786
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:13,040
And one of those songs would be from NSYNC, Bye Bye Bye.

1787
02:14:13,040 --> 02:14:18,860
And this is an official Konami song that was supposed to be in EuroMix 2, but never made

1788
02:14:18,860 --> 02:14:24,880
it in, or it's an unlock that, you know, obviously, because the EuroMix 2 site was never finished,

1789
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:29,560
so you know, maybe they just never got around to releasing unlock codes for it, but he says

1790
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:31,840
that's not the only song that's hidden in there too.

1791
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:37,640
there's actually more than one song so I mean we're gonna find out in a few

1792
02:14:37,640 --> 02:14:41,040
weeks here that there's gonna be more and more songs and rumor that these

1793
02:14:41,040 --> 02:14:44,960
songs you know for some reason didn't appear in your mix too they might be in

1794
02:14:44,960 --> 02:14:49,200
your own x3 or the fact the license you might have been cut on them it's hard to

1795
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:53,020
say but that is an official song that was supposed to be in your mix to bye

1796
02:14:53,020 --> 02:14:54,020
Bye bye bye.

1797
02:14:54,020 --> 02:14:55,020
So.

1798
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:56,020
Yeah.

1799
02:14:56,020 --> 02:14:57,020
Rob.

1800
02:14:57,020 --> 02:14:58,020
And Lisa.

1801
02:14:58,020 --> 02:15:17,180
See, I have to listen to people play the light FM.

1802
02:15:17,180 --> 02:15:20,080
See, I thought I got away from it when I lost my job.

1803
02:15:20,080 --> 02:15:23,080
But no, people played around me all the time now.

1804
02:15:23,080 --> 02:15:24,080
Guess what though?

1805
02:15:24,080 --> 02:15:25,080
What?

1806
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:29,080
I get them back by playing, um, I'm gonna make a CD tonight picked to work.

1807
02:15:29,080 --> 02:15:30,080
Uh huh.

1808
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:31,080
Of Hair Rock.

1809
02:15:31,080 --> 02:15:32,080
Cool.

1810
02:15:32,080 --> 02:15:34,080
Poison Motley Crue, Guns N' Roses.

1811
02:15:34,080 --> 02:15:39,080
Walk this way!

1812
02:15:39,080 --> 02:15:40,080
And Tesla.

1813
02:15:40,080 --> 02:15:42,080
Walk this way!

1814
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:44,080
And then they have to put up with my tramp.

1815
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:49,080
And everyone leaves the office when I'm working my overtime, so I turn up my tramp CD.

1816
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:54,080
What a cool- We can't hear you, Irene.

1817
02:15:54,080 --> 02:15:59,080
I play Orange Lounge all day every day because they let me listen to it and they don't care.

1818
02:15:59,080 --> 02:16:05,080
It's funny because, you know, when you play, like, Highs Off You or, you know, any other song that says, like, bug or shit, you know.

1819
02:16:05,080 --> 02:16:11,080
Like, some will be a fact thing next to me and you'll say that and, la la la la, no one cares. So, yeah.

1820
02:16:11,080 --> 02:16:15,080
You can't even understand it in Highs Off You. You can't understand the I feel in that song.

1821
02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:24,080
This is actually a good segue, because I wanted to go back. You guys weren't paying attention because you were watching the Matrix thing, but Muhimer had a pretty interesting F.U. of the week, so I want to read this again.

1822
02:16:24,080 --> 02:16:26,080
He said...

1823
02:16:26,080 --> 02:16:28,080
Welcome back!

1824
02:16:28,080 --> 02:16:33,080
So, I wanted to go back to Muhimer's Fuck You of the Week. This is interesting. He said, this is a part of it, he says,

1825
02:16:33,080 --> 02:16:41,080
Fuck the six flags near me, because they had to get rid of their four extremes, because some bitch complained about the word bitch in it.

1826
02:16:41,080 --> 02:16:43,080
Really?

1827
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:45,080
What are you guys thinking about?

1828
02:16:45,080 --> 02:16:46,080
Where?

1829
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:48,080
BITCH!

1830
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:51,080
Whoever took that out, you're a bitch.

1831
02:16:51,080 --> 02:16:53,080
Bitches are everywhere, you can't get away from them.

1832
02:16:53,080 --> 02:16:55,080
So just deal with it, okay?

1833
02:16:55,080 --> 02:16:59,080
Just like retarded kids and faggots.

1834
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:10,080
The official term, or the technical term for them, are window lickers.

1835
02:17:10,080 --> 02:17:24,720
just like to say to that woman wait it's somewhere in here hold on hold on yeah

1836
02:17:24,720 --> 02:17:27,120
there you go what'd you do every time that song played on the radio did you

1837
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:32,680
call the station and complain and tell them to go off air once again it's stupid

1838
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:39,080
parents trying to get other people to parent their job for them if your kids

1839
02:17:39,080 --> 02:17:42,080
Oh my god, they heard the word bitch.

1840
02:17:42,080 --> 02:17:45,080
Well, oh my god, turn on the TV.

1841
02:17:45,080 --> 02:17:49,080
Well, you know what people's fascination is with curse words anyway?

1842
02:17:49,080 --> 02:17:51,080
It's the fact that you tell them you can't do it.

1843
02:17:51,080 --> 02:17:55,080
If you don't like the word bitch, become Amish.

1844
02:17:55,080 --> 02:18:01,080
Children would not be as apt to curse if you acted like it was no big thing.

1845
02:18:01,080 --> 02:18:02,080
You know?

1846
02:18:02,080 --> 02:18:08,080
I hope you don't let your kids watch TV because they say bitch on it all the time.

1847
02:18:08,080 --> 02:18:16,080
Everyone should read the first story in The Illustrated Man, which I'm reading right now.

1848
02:18:16,080 --> 02:18:22,080
It talks about parenting and what happens when you don't parent your kids yourself.

1849
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:25,080
It's really bad, so yeah, you should read it.

1850
02:18:25,080 --> 02:18:29,080
If you have a question as to what song in DDR has bitch in it,

1851
02:18:29,080 --> 02:18:48,520
It says in the background, not an extreme, bitch, no that song is gone, but this is going

1852
02:18:48,520 --> 02:18:53,240
to be interesting because the rumor is, and this is merely rumor at this point, but supposedly

1853
02:18:53,240 --> 02:18:59,920
in that trailer for Max 2 USA, somebody caught a glimpse of the DJ Alligator Project video

1854
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:03,440
for Blow My Whistle Bitch, which is going to be interesting to see how the USA treats

1855
02:19:03,440 --> 02:19:04,440
that.

1856
02:19:04,440 --> 02:19:08,760
Well, here's the thing, though, is he actually officially had, it wasn't, you know, the fact

1857
02:19:08,760 --> 02:19:10,760
that it was censored, there's two different songs.

1858
02:19:10,760 --> 02:19:14,720
They're the same damn song, but it's Blow My Whistle Bitch and Blow My Whistle Baby,

1859
02:19:14,720 --> 02:19:20,440
or The Whistle Song, see, so that's actually, you know, the official title is, you know,

1860
02:19:20,440 --> 02:19:25,160
the whistle song but you know that's over here you know what I caught them

1861
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:30,040
both sucks well here's the thing anyways I mean I'm sure they're gonna censor

1862
02:19:30,040 --> 02:19:34,920
because if we have like you know was a gentle stress the AMD sensual mix

1863
02:19:34,920 --> 02:19:41,200
instead of sexual I mean yeah they're stupid but whatever don't care I'm

1864
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:45,040
getting yelled at because I played the one-two little bitch by bus stop and not

1865
02:19:45,040 --> 02:19:49,080
the specials which is the one that's actually an extreme sorry get over it my

1866
02:19:49,080 --> 02:19:54,080
Actually, if you want to be technical, Little Bitch was in the first DDR.

1867
02:19:54,080 --> 02:20:01,080
Right, and that's why it was brought back for Xtreme, because remember they brought back a bunch of old school DDR songs like Butterfly?

1868
02:20:01,080 --> 02:20:04,080
Oh my god, some guy wanted me to play Butterfly the other day.

1869
02:20:04,080 --> 02:20:05,080
Did you do it?

1870
02:20:05,080 --> 02:20:06,080
No.

1871
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:07,080
Would you tell him?

1872
02:20:07,080 --> 02:20:13,080
I said, I played that a lot when the game was new.

1873
02:20:13,080 --> 02:20:15,080
And he was like, oh.

1874
02:20:15,080 --> 02:20:18,080
I was playing DDR with someone I've never met before.

1875
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:28,080
I miss being able to do that, you know? Back in the days when no one knew who the other one was, and we'd all randomly play DDR together, and then we just sort of eventually told each other our names.

1876
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:32,080
Stop it, Rob. You can stop that right now.

1877
02:20:37,080 --> 02:20:39,080
Hey, let's do, um, List List.

1878
02:20:39,080 --> 02:20:40,080
Oh, we're gonna do List List now?

1879
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:41,080
Yeah.

1880
02:20:41,080 --> 02:20:44,080
Okay, so we have to take a quick break, and then we're gonna come back and do List List.

1881
02:20:44,080 --> 02:20:46,080
Play, um, the Desiro songs from Papa Music.

1882
02:20:46,080 --> 02:20:50,040
Okay, we're going to play some Desero songs from Poppin' Music, so it's going to be not

1883
02:20:50,040 --> 02:20:51,420
a too long of a break.

1884
02:20:51,420 --> 02:21:00,340
So we have Cobalt from Poppin' Music 9, and we have Pure from Poppin' Music 8.

1885
02:21:00,340 --> 02:21:08,000
And then I'm going to play something from DDR Solo Mix, just for good measure.

1886
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:14,000
No, I'm going to play Wonderland from Third Mix, and then we'll come back listless.

1887
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
And what is tonight's listless topic?

1888
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Best Bemani songs to fuck by.

1889
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Yes, just like our live journal, Best Bemani songs to fuck too.

1890
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
We'll be back.

1891
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:29,400
Okay y'all, this is it, now pump it, the mic will sing soon as I touch it

1892
02:25:29,400 --> 02:25:32,800
Dude, it's smooth and easy like, so we might get hyped to hear tonight

1893
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:34,800
She might relax and she's way the back

1894
02:25:34,800 --> 02:25:37,600
If you ain't with that, I'ma have to attack you with a bad rap

1895
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:40,800
That can smack the smile off your face, that's when it's up, no crap

1896
02:25:40,800 --> 02:25:44,800
Give it a little bit of heart and soul as you do it, till you in your ear hole, huh

1897
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:46,800
I ain't going out like a sucker

1898
02:25:46,800 --> 02:25:48,800
And if you think so, boy, then puff up

1899
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:50,880
Off the chips, I'm outta this lyric, it's slow

1900
02:25:50,880 --> 02:25:52,280
And I'm on it, word up, it's through

1901
02:25:52,280 --> 02:25:53,600
It's that you do, move you

1902
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:55,200
Fightin' people, now it's time to

1903
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:32,200
Hi, this is Mel B. of RTF. Before an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B. can join

1904
02:26:34,400 --> 02:26:39,080
us on all the fun together. Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come

1905
02:26:39,080 --> 02:26:43,480
to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

1906
02:26:43,480 --> 02:26:48,280
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Kick it with me and you just might realize the

1907
02:26:48,280 --> 02:26:53,160
best things in life are free. That's right, you tell them Mel. Our buddy Mel B.

1908
02:26:53,160 --> 02:26:59,660
Okay, so, back to the show, and back to the listless topic at hand.

1909
02:26:59,660 --> 02:27:02,460
Jamie, what is the listless topic at hand?

1910
02:27:02,460 --> 02:27:04,460
Best of any songs to fuck to.

1911
02:27:04,460 --> 02:27:05,460
Or to hand to.

1912
02:27:05,460 --> 02:27:06,460
No, just kidding.

1913
02:27:06,460 --> 02:27:07,460
To fuck to.

1914
02:27:07,460 --> 02:27:08,460
To fuck.

1915
02:27:08,460 --> 02:27:09,460
This is und.

1916
02:27:09,460 --> 02:27:10,460
The unforific topic.

1917
02:27:10,460 --> 02:27:11,460
Yeah.

1918
02:27:11,460 --> 02:27:12,460
So, are we ready?

1919
02:27:12,460 --> 02:27:13,460
I am.

1920
02:27:13,460 --> 02:27:14,460
Okay.

1921
02:27:14,460 --> 02:27:16,460
Are you going to be okay, Irene?

1922
02:27:16,460 --> 02:27:18,460
Because you said you weren't ready yet.

1923
02:27:18,460 --> 02:27:19,460
You said you weren't ready.

1924
02:27:19,460 --> 02:27:20,460
Okay, all right.

1925
02:27:20,460 --> 02:27:21,460
Who wants to start?

1926
02:27:21,460 --> 02:27:22,460
I will.

1927
02:27:22,460 --> 02:27:25,860
Okay, Jamie numbers. Oh, we haven't done list list in a long time

1928
02:27:25,860 --> 02:27:30,180
I guess I should explain what this is all about or do you want to you want me like we all pick our top threes

1929
02:27:30,300 --> 02:27:33,360
And then we all vote one off and then you vote yes

1930
02:27:33,620 --> 02:27:40,000
So the chat room has the final say so you can vote and this is a scientific proven process

1931
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
This is the top three of all time no disputing

1932
02:27:42,620 --> 02:27:44,620
Okay, so Jamie you're number three

1933
02:27:45,820 --> 02:27:48,180
Okay, my number three is a gravity

1934
02:27:49,260 --> 02:27:50,780
gravity

1935
02:27:50,780 --> 02:27:52,780
Not a Loki remix?

1936
02:27:52,780 --> 02:27:56,780
Well, that's a little bit too angry. That's like the S&M, you know.

1937
02:27:56,780 --> 02:28:00,780
I say Gravity because if you think about it, it's like rhythmically good.

1938
02:28:00,780 --> 02:28:04,780
Brad said Gravity, the anal burnination mix.

1939
02:28:04,780 --> 02:28:07,780
Okay, fine. I'll go next.

1940
02:28:07,780 --> 02:28:13,780
My number three pick, and this would be for like if you're having some fast, dirty, rotten sex, Max 300s.

1941
02:28:13,780 --> 02:28:16,780
Ew.

1942
02:28:16,780 --> 02:28:19,280
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.

1943
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:20,780
Okay.

1944
02:28:20,780 --> 02:28:23,420
Loke, you're number three pick.

1945
02:28:23,420 --> 02:28:31,780
Um, I was gonna say, probably, we've gotta go with hot limit, because it's a longer song.

1946
02:28:31,780 --> 02:28:35,780
And, uh, ya know, people like things that are longer, so.

1947
02:28:35,780 --> 02:28:37,280
I'm not gonna make a comment.

1948
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:39,340
It doesn't work.

1949
02:28:39,340 --> 02:28:40,760
It doesn't.

1950
02:28:40,760 --> 02:28:41,760
What?

1951
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:43,540
It doesn't work.

1952
02:28:43,540 --> 02:28:44,560
Oh, my.

1953
02:28:44,560 --> 02:28:46,560
Oh, my.

1954
02:28:46,560 --> 02:28:50,560
Oh my, as the room slowly gets it. La la la la la.

1955
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:54,560
Okay.

1956
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:58,560
Yeah, I know, seriously. Alright, Irene, your turn.

1957
02:28:58,560 --> 02:29:02,560
Um, I picked a serious one.

1958
02:29:02,560 --> 02:29:06,560
Ecstasy, because, I mean, come on now. Like, I need to explain stuff.

1959
02:29:06,560 --> 02:29:10,560
Okay, Brad's turn. Ecstasy. Ecstasy, ugh.

1960
02:29:10,560 --> 02:29:14,560
Alright. Brad, Mr. Lanky Style.

1961
02:29:14,560 --> 02:29:16,560
Wait, did Mac go already?

1962
02:29:16,560 --> 02:29:17,560
He did.

1963
02:29:17,560 --> 02:29:18,560
Okay.

1964
02:29:18,560 --> 02:29:19,560
Everybody beat you.

1965
02:29:19,560 --> 02:29:26,560
I'm going to have to say In the Heat of the Night is my number three.

1966
02:29:26,560 --> 02:29:28,560
In the Heat of the Night.

1967
02:29:28,560 --> 02:29:29,560
Sorry.

1968
02:29:29,560 --> 02:29:30,560
Okay.

1969
02:29:30,560 --> 02:29:31,560
My number two?

1970
02:29:31,560 --> 02:29:32,560
Yes, your number two.

1971
02:29:32,560 --> 02:29:34,560
It's from Solo, Let the Beat Hit Him.

1972
02:29:34,560 --> 02:29:37,560
Let the Beat Hit Him.

1973
02:29:37,560 --> 02:29:38,560
Actually, don't take that back.

1974
02:29:38,560 --> 02:29:41,560
My other version is from Solo, the version from Max 2.

1975
02:29:41,560 --> 02:29:45,560
Okay, so, uh, let the beat hit a R&B style.

1976
02:29:45,560 --> 02:29:46,560
Yeah.

1977
02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:51,560
It's like if you want, you know, the slow groove.

1978
02:29:51,560 --> 02:29:52,560
Nice.

1979
02:29:52,560 --> 02:29:53,560
Uh, my turn.

1980
02:29:53,560 --> 02:29:58,560
My number two pick, um, and this is one that came to me during the break, but honestly,

1981
02:29:58,560 --> 02:29:59,560
think about it.

1982
02:29:59,560 --> 02:30:00,560
This song will be awesome.

1983
02:30:00,560 --> 02:30:01,560
This song will be awesome.

1984
02:30:01,560 --> 02:30:02,560
That's next to it.

1985
02:30:02,560 --> 02:30:03,560
Jem Jem Reggae.

1986
02:30:03,560 --> 02:30:08,560
What the fuck are you smoking, man?

1987
02:30:08,560 --> 02:30:09,560
Instant softy for me.

1988
02:30:09,560 --> 02:30:12,560
I mean, that's not going to do anything.

1989
02:30:12,560 --> 02:30:14,560
I can't spell reggae.

1990
02:30:14,560 --> 02:30:16,560
Yeah, there you go.

1991
02:30:16,560 --> 02:30:18,560
There's validity behind it.

1992
02:30:18,560 --> 02:30:19,560
Just think about it.

1993
02:30:19,560 --> 02:30:22,560
A-E. Oh, my bad.

1994
02:30:22,560 --> 02:30:24,560
There it is.

1995
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:25,560
Sorry, I'm too white.

1996
02:30:25,560 --> 02:30:27,560
I'm too white to spell.

1997
02:30:27,560 --> 02:30:28,560
Just thinkin'.

1998
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:29,560
On the make-up.

1999
02:30:29,560 --> 02:30:30,560
Jam, jam, regga-do-go.

2000
02:30:30,560 --> 02:30:31,560
Anyway, come on.

2001
02:30:31,560 --> 02:30:35,560
Shut up.

2002
02:30:35,560 --> 02:30:37,560
Get away from me.

2003
02:30:37,560 --> 02:30:39,560
Irene. Oh, sorry, Loki.

2004
02:30:39,560 --> 02:30:41,560
Yeah.

2005
02:30:41,560 --> 02:30:45,560
Just because it's got the, you know, background to go with it.

2006
02:30:45,560 --> 02:30:47,560
Sexy Planet.

2007
02:30:47,560 --> 02:30:51,560
You took my fucking pick, you bastard!

2008
02:30:51,560 --> 02:30:53,560
Okay, that's fine.

2009
02:30:53,560 --> 02:30:55,560
Okay, so Sexy Planet.

2010
02:30:55,560 --> 02:30:58,560
Irene, your number two pick.

2011
02:30:58,560 --> 02:31:01,560
You took it. I have to go with Love Machine.

2012
02:31:01,560 --> 02:31:02,560
Love Machine.

2013
02:31:02,560 --> 02:31:03,560
Yeah.

2014
02:31:03,560 --> 02:31:05,560
I'm just a love machine. I like that song.

2015
02:31:05,560 --> 02:31:07,560
I have another one, but I...

2016
02:31:08,560 --> 02:31:09,560
Alright.

2017
02:31:09,560 --> 02:31:10,560
Oh, yeah.

2018
02:31:10,560 --> 02:31:12,560
Uh, Mr. Brad, your number two pick, please.

2019
02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:13,560
DXY, baby.

2020
02:31:13,560 --> 02:31:14,560
DXY.

2021
02:31:14,560 --> 02:31:18,560
It's got the perfect flow, and it's got the climax in there, and then the call, you know,

2022
02:31:18,560 --> 02:31:19,560
Oh my.

2023
02:31:19,560 --> 02:31:20,560
Yeah, the cigarette part at the end.

2024
02:31:20,560 --> 02:31:23,560
The flow, the climax, and the cigarette, it's all there.

2025
02:31:23,560 --> 02:31:26,560
Not the flow, like, that kind of flow, you fuckin' sicko.

2026
02:31:26,560 --> 02:31:28,560
I mean, like, the build-up.

2027
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:32,560
Like, starts off, starts off slow, build up, like, dangerous.

2028
02:31:32,560 --> 02:31:33,560
I'm gonna...

2029
02:31:33,560 --> 02:31:34,560
Yeah.

2030
02:31:34,560 --> 02:31:36,560
Yeah, anyway, jig fly.

2031
02:31:36,560 --> 02:31:38,560
Alright, like what?

2032
02:31:38,560 --> 02:31:42,560
Jamie, your number one pick, best song to oomph to.

2033
02:31:42,560 --> 02:31:47,560
I'm gonna not, I had another one that was the obvious choice, but actually, Sink.

2034
02:31:47,560 --> 02:31:48,560
Sink?

2035
02:31:48,560 --> 02:31:59,560
Because it actually does have, it actually does have the slow build up, the yay, you know, this is fun, and then the dying off the end.

2036
02:31:59,560 --> 02:32:04,560
That's if you're into asphyxiation.

2037
02:32:08,560 --> 02:32:11,560
So...

2038
02:32:11,560 --> 02:32:16,560
Guess what everybody, this is just in. Zero's having an orange lounge party at his house in two weeks.

2039
02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:19,560
Yay! Party! Party!

2040
02:32:19,560 --> 02:32:20,560
Okay, Reed!

2041
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:21,560
What?

2042
02:32:21,560 --> 02:32:26,560
Um, Zero. Just, uh, thought I'd remind you a little bit.

2043
02:32:26,560 --> 02:32:29,560
Oh, never mind. Continue.

2044
02:32:29,560 --> 02:32:32,560
Wait, you thought two weeks was Fanime or something?

2045
02:32:32,560 --> 02:32:34,560
Or what? I don't know what...

2046
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:37,560
Exactly what I was thinking.

2047
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:42,560
Well, sorta is. In two weekends it'll be Fanime, I think.

2048
02:32:42,560 --> 02:32:44,560
Okay, let's keep going with the list list.

2049
02:32:44,560 --> 02:32:46,560
Back to list list, thank you.

2050
02:32:46,560 --> 02:32:48,560
My number one pick would be, of course...

2051
02:32:48,560 --> 02:32:53,560
You know, this is obvious. I'm sorry, I am going with the obvious, because it's true. Do it all night.

2052
02:32:57,560 --> 02:33:01,560
Alright, fine. Well then fine, let's hear your number one obvious pick.

2053
02:33:02,560 --> 02:33:10,560
Okay, mine is going to be Wild Rush, because it starts off slow and it gets faster as it goes along.

2054
02:33:11,560 --> 02:33:14,560
Actually, the Wild Rush remix is pretty hot.

2055
02:33:14,560 --> 02:33:21,560
Alright. Yeah! Rice Princess, your number one pick.

2056
02:33:21,560 --> 02:33:26,560
Um, is no one going to say one of the other obvious songs?

2057
02:33:26,560 --> 02:33:29,560
It's down to you and Brad, so you better figure out.

2058
02:33:29,560 --> 02:33:34,560
Can I give an honorable mention? No, say what? After we're done.

2059
02:33:34,560 --> 02:33:39,560
Okay, my number one's Afronova. Don't ask, I don't know.

2060
02:33:39,560 --> 02:33:44,720
Afrinova. I guess everybody was being nice to me so they can give me the real obvious

2061
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:53,720
one. Okay. Okay. My number one choice. Trumbo please. Yes. Crash. Please don't. I'm kidding,

2062
02:33:53,720 --> 02:34:01,080
I'm kidding. Thank you. Insertion, duh. Insertion, thank you. Why? Okay, now we're going to the

2063
02:34:01,080 --> 02:34:05,080
honorable mentions. No one said the whistle song. No one said after the game of love.

2064
02:34:05,080 --> 02:34:06,080
Because those suck.

2065
02:34:06,080 --> 02:34:07,080
Temple of love.

2066
02:34:07,080 --> 02:34:09,080
No Greco-Lalman style.

2067
02:34:09,080 --> 02:34:10,080
Thanks.

2068
02:34:12,080 --> 02:34:14,080
Alright, so here is the list.

2069
02:34:15,080 --> 02:34:17,080
Have you never been mellow?

2070
02:34:17,080 --> 02:34:20,080
Here's some of the bullshit lists I had before we go on.

2071
02:34:20,080 --> 02:34:21,080
Dead End.

2072
02:34:21,080 --> 02:34:23,080
Healing Vision Angelic Mix.

2073
02:34:23,080 --> 02:34:24,080
Hypnotic Crisis.

2074
02:34:24,080 --> 02:34:28,080
Paranoid of Dirty Mix, in case you're like, you're uh, paranoid.

2075
02:34:28,080 --> 02:34:31,080
Of, you're jealous and you're, yeah.

2076
02:34:31,080 --> 02:34:33,080
Well, and Crash of course.

2077
02:34:33,080 --> 02:34:36,800
of course I actually wouldn't mind one of the other ones I was gonna say was

2078
02:34:36,800 --> 02:34:42,520
paranoia clean just like the the pounding one or I was gonna say

2079
02:34:42,520 --> 02:34:47,080
hellscaper or maybe crimson hat Center

2080
02:34:48,120 --> 02:34:52,640

2082
02:35:01,800 --> 02:35:09,800
Boom Boom Dollar, Dubby Dub, So Many Men, It's Raining Men, Test My Best, Cowgirl.

2083
02:35:09,800 --> 02:35:14,800
I've never heard the full version of So Many Men. It's like she's an utter slut.

2084
02:35:14,800 --> 02:35:21,800
Now I would have picked this song had it been in the actual game and not just part of the megamix.

2085
02:35:21,800 --> 02:35:43,440
the MegaMix, the Paranoid Evolution, and of course, shame on all of us for forgetting

2086
02:35:43,440 --> 02:35:46,120
this one, Be In My Paradise.

2087
02:35:46,120 --> 02:35:47,120
Okay, no.

2088
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:52,120
Being in my paradise, Rob, makes me break out in hives.

2089
02:35:53,120 --> 02:35:54,120
It's really nasty.

2090
02:35:55,120 --> 02:35:56,120
Alright.

2091
02:35:57,120 --> 02:35:58,120
Let's, uh...

2092
02:35:58,120 --> 02:36:01,120
Oh, there's, like, um, right now.

2093
02:36:02,120 --> 02:36:03,120
By the way, guess what?

2094
02:36:03,120 --> 02:36:04,120
Come on, baby, do it.

2095
02:36:04,120 --> 02:36:07,120
I was looking at an old issue of People magazine because I leave those at my work sometimes.

2096
02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:08,120
Uh-huh.

2097
02:36:08,120 --> 02:36:09,120
There was a review for Atomic Kitten in there.

2098
02:36:09,120 --> 02:36:12,120
I know, and I saw an Atomic Kitten video at Faces one night.

2099
02:36:12,120 --> 02:36:13,120
It was cool.

2100
02:36:13,120 --> 02:36:14,120
Yeah, you were there.

2101
02:36:14,120 --> 02:36:15,120
Yeah, I am.

2102
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:17,120
But they said that they suck.

2103
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:31,120
A little advice if any of you guys want to get the ladies in the mood, any Thomas Howard song or Jeff Koot, any Jeff Koot song? Yeah, Ladies Will Love You.

2104
02:36:33,120 --> 02:36:38,120
Ladies Will Love Thomas Howard, trust me. Even though he's gay.

2105
02:36:38,120 --> 02:36:44,520
All right, let's get to the elimination part, please.

2106
02:36:44,520 --> 02:36:49,280
Here's the list so far, Gravity, Max 300, Hot Limit, Ecstasy, In The Heat Of The Night,

2107
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:55,720
Let The Beat Hit Em R&B, Jam Jam Reggae, Sexy Planet, Love Machine, DXY, Sync, Do It All

2108
02:36:55,720 --> 02:36:58,720
Night, Wild Rush, Afronova, and Insertion.

2109
02:36:58,720 --> 02:37:01,040
Jamie, what's coming off the list?

2110
02:37:01,040 --> 02:37:02,720
Jam Jam Raigu.

2111
02:37:02,720 --> 02:37:05,400
You stink.

2112
02:37:05,400 --> 02:37:06,920
Jam Jam Reggae is the best.

2113
02:37:06,920 --> 02:37:11,400
Come on you guys, you stink.

2114
02:37:11,400 --> 02:37:19,080
Mine I'm going to take off, I don't care.

2115
02:37:19,080 --> 02:37:27,200
I'm going to take off, I'm just kind of drawn to the, well, I don't know why, all these

2116
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:32,240
songs are pretty good, but I just, I don't see gravity so much, so I'm going to take

2117
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:33,240
off gravity.

2118
02:37:33,240 --> 02:37:34,520
Listen to it.

2119
02:37:34,520 --> 02:37:39,520
I think of stoic, not gravity, so I think it goes back to that whole stoic versus gravity thing.

2120
02:37:39,520 --> 02:37:42,520
Um, no, because Matt's next. Matt?

2121
02:37:44,520 --> 02:37:46,520
I don't care, but, um...

2122
02:37:47,520 --> 02:37:50,520
Tech does not make good sex music. Sync, bye bye.

2123
02:37:51,520 --> 02:37:53,520
You are so full of shit.

2124
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:55,520
Out phase anyway.

2125
02:37:55,520 --> 02:37:56,520
Whatever.

2126
02:37:56,520 --> 02:37:59,520
Um, Irene?

2127
02:37:59,520 --> 02:38:02,520
I'm gonna take up Hot Limit, because it's stupid.

2128
02:38:02,520 --> 02:38:06,360
thank you

2129
02:38:06,360 --> 02:38:08,680
you big pile and all

2130
02:38:08,680 --> 02:38:13,240
raging ritalin

2131
02:38:13,240 --> 02:38:16,960
I should have said love me too, that would be a good one

2132
02:38:16,960 --> 02:38:18,240
anyway

2133
02:38:18,240 --> 02:38:20,080
uh...

2134
02:38:20,080 --> 02:38:20,800
yeah whatever

2135
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:26,080
okay I'll say

2136
02:38:26,080 --> 02:38:31,640
uh... I'm gonna have to go with

2137
02:38:31,640 --> 02:38:33,040
Let the beat hit him or be fat.

2138
02:38:33,040 --> 02:38:33,400
Great.

2139
02:38:33,400 --> 02:38:34,160
Vote all nine off.

2140
02:38:34,160 --> 02:38:34,720
Thank you.

2141
02:38:34,720 --> 02:38:35,920
Did all yours get voted on?

2142
02:38:35,920 --> 02:38:36,420
Yes.

2143
02:38:36,420 --> 02:38:36,920
Oh, sorry.

2144
02:38:36,920 --> 02:38:38,120
I didn't notice that.

2145
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:42,520
I guess Jamie's are all gone.

2146
02:38:42,520 --> 02:38:43,020
I'm sorry.

2147
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:46,280
All right.

2148
02:38:51,800 --> 02:38:54,120
All right.

2149
02:38:54,120 --> 02:38:55,560
Here's the list.

2150
02:38:55,560 --> 02:38:58,080
And you folks can vote on it right now in the chat room.

2151
02:38:58,080 --> 02:39:05,880
Max300, Ecstasy, and I spelled it wrong, I'm sorry.

2152
02:39:05,880 --> 02:39:10,840
In the Heat of the Night, actually why didn't it come up in my spellcheck then, that's weird.

2153
02:39:10,840 --> 02:39:12,260
I guess so.

2154
02:39:12,260 --> 02:39:20,120
In the Heat of the Night, Sexy Planet, Love Machine, DXY, Do It All Night, Wild Rush,

2155
02:39:20,120 --> 02:39:23,160
Afronova, and Insertion.

2156
02:39:23,160 --> 02:39:26,880
So you can send those votes to me.

2157
02:39:26,880 --> 02:39:29,320
My name is Sky and I'm in the chat room right now.

2158
02:39:29,320 --> 02:39:30,320
Hi!

2159
02:39:30,320 --> 02:39:35,940
And you can send your pics to me over private message because you love me.

2160
02:39:35,940 --> 02:39:47,140
In the meantime, a quick break featuring some more Guitar Freak songs.

2161
02:39:47,140 --> 02:39:52,860
How about, I'm just going to pick random ones from this little CD that Jamie gave me.

2162
02:39:52,860 --> 02:39:55,720
Monkey Magic, that's always a fun one.

2163
02:39:55,720 --> 02:39:59,360
And um, I like Monkey.

2164
02:39:59,360 --> 02:40:07,080
And um, Sweet Feline, or did we, no we already did that one, didn't we?

2165
02:40:07,080 --> 02:40:08,200
I don't think I did that one.

2166
02:40:08,200 --> 02:40:09,200
I don't know.

2167
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:10,600
Let's do, I'm gonna pick another one.

2168
02:40:10,600 --> 02:40:14,040
How about Star of Muse, yes, that will be fun.

2169
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:16,800
And then that's all the time you got to send in your votes.

2170
02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:20,120
And we'll be back to wrap up the big, fat, hairy, scary show.

2171
02:40:20,120 --> 02:40:21,680
Stay tuned.

2172
02:40:21,680 --> 02:40:22,680
Yes, Logie?

2173
02:40:22,680 --> 02:40:28,520
Real quickly, because I know I forgot to mention it, but it is big news in case

2174
02:40:28,520 --> 02:40:33,900
if no one's been reading, it sort of ties in with it, the stuff.

2175
02:40:33,900 --> 02:40:38,620
Anyways, the edit code for the DDR Extreme Machine has been found

2176
02:40:38,620 --> 02:40:42,120
and now we can make DDR Extreme edits and have started to do so.

2177
02:40:43,960 --> 02:40:45,260
So, yay. Rejoice.

2178
02:40:46,080 --> 02:40:47,680
All right.

2179
02:40:48,040 --> 02:40:48,500
We'll be back.

2180
02:41:18,500 --> 02:41:22,500
Leave the garden, everybody just have some fun

2181
02:41:23,500 --> 02:41:27,500
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic

2182
02:41:27,500 --> 02:41:31,500
It's Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic

2183
02:41:34,500 --> 02:41:38,500
There's a little, little, monkey magic

2184
02:41:38,500 --> 02:41:42,500
You should find a way to die

2185
02:41:43,500 --> 02:41:47,500
There's a little, little, monkey magic

2186
02:42:17,500 --> 02:42:28,500
Monkey magic, monkey magic, monkey magic

2187
02:44:17,500 --> 02:44:36,500
I will never know, but you will never show Come on and love me now, come on and love

2188
02:44:36,500 --> 02:44:41,500
I will never know, but you will never show

2189
02:44:41,500 --> 02:44:45,500
Come on and get me now, come on and get me now

2190
02:44:45,500 --> 02:44:48,500
Come on and get me now

2191
02:45:19,500 --> 02:45:25,500
And I'm here for that moment with you concentrate

2192
02:45:25,500 --> 02:45:29,500
I will never know cause you will never show

2193
02:45:29,500 --> 02:45:33,500
Come on and love me now, come on and love me now

2194
02:45:33,500 --> 02:45:38,500
I will never know cause you will never show

2195
02:45:38,500 --> 02:45:42,500
Come on and love me now, come on and love me now

2196
02:45:42,500 --> 02:45:46,500
Come on and love me now

2197
02:45:46,500 --> 02:46:14,500
Home to Hindi, home to Thorns Lounge Radio, home to Hindi, home to Newton, with the ping pong ball!

2198
02:46:14,500 --> 02:46:18,500
Hello everybody.

2199
02:46:18,500 --> 02:46:20,500
So what's going on?

2200
02:46:20,500 --> 02:46:26,500
I think we had to do the winner or something.

2201
02:46:26,500 --> 02:46:27,500
I don't know.

2202
02:46:27,500 --> 02:46:29,500
Supposed to be announcing the winner for something?

2203
02:46:29,500 --> 02:46:30,500
Yeah.

2204
02:46:30,500 --> 02:46:32,500
Yeah, but Rob's occupied.

2205
02:46:32,500 --> 02:46:33,500
Okay, why is it?

2206
02:46:33,500 --> 02:46:34,500
I want to know this.

2207
02:46:34,500 --> 02:46:35,500
Why is it?

2208
02:46:35,500 --> 02:46:40,500
I get, like seriously, when we went on air, did not, did or did not, the house line rang

2209
02:46:40,500 --> 02:46:42,500
and my cell phone went off right when we went on air.

2210
02:46:42,500 --> 02:46:43,500
Then why not turn them off?

2211
02:46:43,500 --> 02:46:48,500
I'm going to. I don't even remember who it was.

2212
02:46:48,500 --> 02:46:50,500
Who was it? I don't know.

2213
02:46:50,500 --> 02:46:54,500
You know, when I used to come for my visitations to under sedation, I would turn off my cell phone.

2214
02:46:54,500 --> 02:46:58,500
My cell phone wouldn't even work in there, and it hasn't been working. That should have been my F.U. of the week.

2215
02:46:58,500 --> 02:47:02,500
Oh my God, my cell phone has not been working in the house even recently, so I'm surprised.

2216
02:47:02,500 --> 02:47:03,500
My cell phone doesn't work in my house.

2217
02:47:03,500 --> 02:47:08,500
It even went off at all. Who was it that called? I don't even remember. I guess, whatever.

2218
02:47:08,500 --> 02:47:37,500
Okay, so, um, let's see, oh yes, the list list, here it is, the top three songs to Unf 2, Have Sexor 2, Get Dirty and Naughty 2, third place, drum roll please, beautiful, Ecstasy, yay, that was number three, Ecstasy, yay, second place,

2219
02:47:37,500 --> 02:47:42,500
The winner is DXY! Yay!

2220
02:47:42,500 --> 02:47:44,500
Yeah, second is DXY.

2221
02:47:44,500 --> 02:47:48,500
And in first place, by a landslide.

2222
02:47:48,500 --> 02:47:50,500
Insertion.

2223
02:47:50,500 --> 02:47:52,500
Of course.

2224
02:47:52,500 --> 02:47:53,500
So.

2225
02:47:56,500 --> 02:47:58,500
That's that.

2226
02:47:58,500 --> 02:48:00,500
Listless, hope you guys enjoyed.

2227
02:48:00,500 --> 02:48:04,500
And an honorary vote for Sky's Voice The Game. You suck!

2228
02:48:04,500 --> 02:48:16,140
And now with some show news, I think we'll be able to do phones next week and I figured

2229
02:48:16,140 --> 02:48:17,860
out a way to do it.

2230
02:48:17,860 --> 02:48:24,420
So if you're interested in being able to do this next week, we're going to be using a

2231
02:48:24,420 --> 02:48:29,820
program probably called Phone Free and I will post a link in the chat room where you can

2232
02:48:29,820 --> 02:48:30,820
and find this program.

2233
02:48:30,820 --> 02:48:32,300
And just basically sign up.

2234
02:48:32,300 --> 02:48:34,620
It's totally free.

2235
02:48:34,620 --> 02:48:36,820
And what you're going to want to do is I'll also give you

2236
02:48:36,820 --> 02:48:40,100
guys an ID number, which will be our phone number.

2237
02:48:40,100 --> 02:48:43,500
And so during the show, we'll have this hopefully available

2238
02:48:43,500 --> 02:48:48,500
live, and I should be able to answer, well, PC phone calls.

2239
02:48:48,500 --> 02:48:50,420
It's not really using your actual phone line.

2240
02:48:50,420 --> 02:48:53,460
Phone line is just almost like voice chatting over, like,

2241
02:48:53,460 --> 02:48:55,260
Yahoo Instant Messenger or something like that.

2242
02:48:55,260 --> 02:48:57,260
So maybe we're going to try that.

2243
02:48:57,260 --> 02:48:58,660
But anyways, I'll post links.

2244
02:48:58,660 --> 02:49:05,660
We'll probably test it out during a fuck-off show sometime in the next week, like before the weekend, I don't know.

2245
02:49:05,660 --> 02:49:09,660
Are you planning on doing any fuck-off shows this week, Jamie? I know you were thinking about, yeah.

2246
02:49:09,660 --> 02:49:12,660
I sort of preempted the rewind Monday.

2247
02:49:12,660 --> 02:49:18,660
It's all good. You know what? The way I think about it, the fuck-offs get more listeners than the rewinds anyway, so it's all good.

2248
02:49:18,660 --> 02:49:23,660
You know, I think, you know, for me it's easier just to come home and do it on Monday.

2249
02:49:23,660 --> 02:49:25,660
Because I'm sort of angsty anyway.

2250
02:49:25,660 --> 02:49:27,660
Do you want to move the rewind? We can always move the rewind.

2251
02:49:27,660 --> 02:49:29,660
I don't care about when we do the rewind.

2252
02:49:29,660 --> 02:49:30,660
Well, we can talk...

2253
02:49:30,660 --> 02:49:31,660
This is the chat room.

2254
02:49:31,660 --> 02:49:33,660
Chat room, go on the live journal community.

2255
02:49:33,660 --> 02:49:34,660
Yes, I was going to say.

2256
02:49:34,660 --> 02:49:35,660
There you go.

2257
02:49:35,660 --> 02:49:36,660
There you go.

2258
02:49:36,660 --> 02:49:37,660
Excellent idea.

2259
02:49:37,660 --> 02:49:40,660
Kathy, start a thread on the live journal community and everyone let us know what would

2260
02:49:40,660 --> 02:49:45,660
be the, if you would leave the rewind on Monday or just keep the Thursday one the way it is

2261
02:49:45,660 --> 02:49:46,660
or whatever.

2262
02:49:46,660 --> 02:49:48,660
We can always move the Monday rewind to Tuesday as well.

2263
02:49:48,660 --> 02:49:50,660
We could just do both of them on Thursday.

2264
02:49:50,660 --> 02:49:51,660
That's a possibility too.

2265
02:49:51,660 --> 02:49:53,660
Run them back to back to back.

2266
02:49:53,660 --> 02:49:54,660
Or Wednesday or whatever.

2267
02:49:54,660 --> 02:49:56,660
Or Saturday afternoon or something.

2268
02:49:56,660 --> 02:49:57,660
Just let us know.

2269
02:49:57,660 --> 02:49:59,660
No, we cannot do it on Saturday afternoon.

2270
02:49:59,660 --> 02:50:01,660
Is that when Understation Live is up?

2271
02:50:01,660 --> 02:50:03,660
We want to encourage people to listen to Understation Live.

2272
02:50:03,660 --> 02:50:04,660
Oh, I didn't realize they were on.

2273
02:50:04,660 --> 02:50:05,660
I thought they moved to Friday.

2274
02:50:05,660 --> 02:50:06,660
I thought they were still doing it on Saturday.

2275
02:50:06,660 --> 02:50:07,660
I thought they moved to Friday.

2276
02:50:07,660 --> 02:50:08,660
I'll check.

2277
02:50:08,660 --> 02:50:09,660
I'll check.

2278
02:50:09,660 --> 02:50:10,660
But you're right.

2279
02:50:10,660 --> 02:50:11,660
We don't want to interfere with Understation Live.

2280
02:50:11,660 --> 02:50:12,660
So I'll check.

2281
02:50:12,660 --> 02:50:13,660
Because we love them.

2282
02:50:13,660 --> 02:50:14,660
Yeah, I'll check and make sure they didn't.

2283
02:50:14,660 --> 02:50:15,660
I thought they moved to Friday.

2284
02:50:15,660 --> 02:50:16,660
We'll see.

2285
02:50:16,660 --> 02:50:17,660
Okay.

2286
02:50:17,660 --> 02:50:22,660
In other show news, Arcadian reminded me of this.

2287
02:50:22,660 --> 02:50:23,660
Arcadian42, thank you.

2288
02:50:23,660 --> 02:50:24,660
I forgot to point this out.

2289
02:50:24,660 --> 02:50:30,120
But everybody, look at the person next to you and give them a big pat on the back.

2290
02:50:30,120 --> 02:50:31,620
I don't see some pats on the back.

2291
02:50:31,620 --> 02:50:36,460
Yes, pat people on the back because, ladies and gentlemen, this week, Orange Lounge Radio

2292
02:50:36,460 --> 02:50:39,460
crossed 2,500 total listening hours.

2293
02:50:39,460 --> 02:50:40,460
Yay!

2294
02:50:40,460 --> 02:50:42,900
That's the highest we've ever been.

2295
02:50:42,900 --> 02:50:43,900
Congratulations.

2296
02:50:43,900 --> 02:50:44,900
We're high.

2297
02:50:44,900 --> 02:50:47,500
And that's because of a lot of hard work from a lot of people.

2298
02:50:47,500 --> 02:50:50,700
And some events that happened this month certainly helped.

2299
02:50:50,700 --> 02:50:54,740
I think we were Bamani-style side of the week for a while, which really helped the website

2300
02:50:54,740 --> 02:50:55,980
hit.

2301
02:50:55,980 --> 02:50:59,220
Our B3 coverage helped a lot too, and the shows have been doing really well.

2302
02:50:59,220 --> 02:51:01,140
So the fuck off shows and everything.

2303
02:51:01,140 --> 02:51:02,620
So everybody's done a great job.

2304
02:51:02,620 --> 02:51:03,620
Yay.

2305
02:51:03,620 --> 02:51:09,180
And also I am going to start doing, well I'm going to be going to school, so I don't know,

2306
02:51:09,180 --> 02:51:13,040
I may have to change the night that I do this, but I am going to be doing at least one regular

2307
02:51:13,040 --> 02:51:15,500
fuck off a week.

2308
02:51:15,500 --> 02:51:16,500
One regular fuck off a week?

2309
02:51:16,500 --> 02:51:19,340
And I think that this week I might do video game trivia.

2310
02:51:19,340 --> 02:51:20,340
Ooh.

2311
02:51:20,340 --> 02:51:26,340
I have to find my CDs or re-download stuff, but maybe not this week, but next week for sure.

2312
02:51:26,340 --> 02:51:30,340
I'll get all the stuff ready to do music trivia.

2313
02:51:30,340 --> 02:51:33,340
Cool. Very cool.

2314
02:51:33,340 --> 02:51:37,340
And, yeah, that'll be fun. And I'll do a fuck-off show at some point this week, too. Probably later.

2315
02:51:37,340 --> 02:51:43,340
I tend to do them, like, whenever I'm just, like, here, Friday or Saturday, late night.

2316
02:51:43,340 --> 02:51:45,340
I need to figure out how to get them to run while I'm doing writing a lot.

2317
02:51:45,340 --> 02:51:46,340
Uh-huh.

2318
02:51:46,340 --> 02:51:48,340
I need to figure out how to get them to do while I'm doing RO.

2319
02:51:48,340 --> 02:51:51,340
I am seriously thinking about getting a Ragnarok account this week, finally.

2320
02:51:51,340 --> 02:51:54,340
Uh-huh! Play on, play on, play on Chaos.

2321
02:51:54,340 --> 02:51:56,340
Chaos.

2322
02:51:56,340 --> 02:52:00,340
To make everybody happy, I'm obviously going to have to have to have one character on both.

2323
02:52:00,340 --> 02:52:04,340
But, but this is the thing, then I can have two different classes.

2324
02:52:04,340 --> 02:52:06,340
That's okay, one of them can be like my learning.

2325
02:52:06,340 --> 02:52:14,340
We'll see. I figure when I do my next job class, I'm going to do it on, um, if I do a merchant, I'm going to do it on Chaos, so I can buy stuff cheap for my character.

2326
02:52:14,340 --> 02:52:20,340
But if I do any other job class, I'm going to do it on the Loki server.

2327
02:52:20,340 --> 02:52:22,340
I might do a Sakurai one, though.

2328
02:52:22,340 --> 02:52:24,340
I started a Sakurai one.

2329
02:52:24,340 --> 02:52:28,340
There's three character slots for each server independent to each server.

2330
02:52:28,340 --> 02:52:31,340
So you can start three classes on each server.

2331
02:52:31,340 --> 02:52:37,340
And Loki's got technically less people on it at most times because Chaos was the original server.

2332
02:52:37,340 --> 02:52:40,340
So there's more or a lot of people who were there since the beginning.

2333
02:52:40,340 --> 02:52:44,340
So, if you want less lag, really there's not much lag on Chaos either.

2334
02:52:44,340 --> 02:52:47,340
I mean, because they only have like around 5,000 at the most.

2335
02:52:47,340 --> 02:52:50,340
I mean, I don't think that's 5,000, so.

2336
02:52:50,340 --> 02:52:54,340
Okay, so it, yeah, I mean, it doesn't really matter what server you start on.

2337
02:52:54,340 --> 02:52:58,340
Just whichever one has more of your friends on it, go to that one, I guess.

2338
02:52:58,340 --> 02:53:04,340
I don't know, whatever. I probably won't even end up signing up, because, like, you know, I...

2339
02:53:04,340 --> 02:53:06,340
You're a poser!

2340
02:53:06,340 --> 02:53:34,340
We did get a lot of listening hours, however our actual rating for the station has fallen quite a bit in the past week.

2341
02:53:34,340 --> 02:53:41,380
I have a feeling I'm not gonna I have a feeling we're zero being zero bombed by another by another station

2342
02:53:41,380 --> 02:53:47,480
I think I think I'm just suspecting and I'm probably creating conspiracies to be there, but I noticed that the rating for another

2343
02:53:48,180 --> 02:53:50,180
Bamani station

2344
02:53:50,900 --> 02:53:56,620
Has gone up significantly while ours has gone down some I'm wondering if something's going on there. I don't know

2345
02:53:56,740 --> 02:54:01,220
Yeah, that's really unprofessional. I don't know. I don't know if it's true. I'm probably suspecting things

2346
02:54:01,220 --> 02:54:03,300
I shouldn't be, and going places I don't need to go.

2347
02:54:03,300 --> 02:54:06,660
I wouldn't listen to another station who did that.

2348
02:54:06,660 --> 02:54:08,140
I wouldn't either.

2349
02:54:08,140 --> 02:54:10,700
Poser's.

2350
02:54:10,700 --> 02:54:13,860
Oh, I listen to another station, but I have an obligation.

2351
02:54:13,860 --> 02:54:15,140
Not just an obligation to me.

2352
02:54:15,140 --> 02:54:18,180
Well, I hate for that other station's thing

2353
02:54:18,180 --> 02:54:19,260
that happened to them.

2354
02:54:19,260 --> 02:54:22,020
Because you know what comes around, you know.

2355
02:54:22,020 --> 02:54:23,660
I need to say right now, right now,

2356
02:54:23,660 --> 02:54:25,600
it's not under station live, obviously.

2357
02:54:25,600 --> 02:54:26,980
It's not DDR Freak.

2358
02:54:26,980 --> 02:54:28,660
DDR Freak Radio and Orange Mountains Radio

2359
02:54:28,660 --> 02:54:30,780
kind of have a silent agreement on where we're not going to go.

2360
02:54:30,780 --> 02:54:39,780
I'd like to give a very big thank you to the powers that be with DDR Freak Radio for being very considerate of us two.

2361
02:54:39,780 --> 02:54:46,780
I think we need to be partners. All of us Bimani stations, we need to be partners in this and not snipe each other.

2362
02:54:46,780 --> 02:54:51,780
Not just Petty, but all of us are working to promote the games and the music.

2363
02:54:51,780 --> 02:54:57,780
I hope nobody came in in the middle of this and is thinking that a specific station that we know of has been doing this.

2364
02:54:57,780 --> 02:55:05,780
I really don't know. Rob said it again, that he doesn't know. He's not interesting. It's just interesting that one goes down and one goes up. It's just interesting, that's all.

2365
02:55:05,780 --> 02:55:13,780
Yeah, and in all honesty, I've looked at a lot of like 365 stations and Orange Lounge is like really the only entertaining one. I'm sorry.

2366
02:55:13,780 --> 02:55:21,780
I personally like to listen to talk. If I want to listen to music, I'll just find pictures of the music files somewhere online.

2367
02:55:21,780 --> 02:55:50,180
If you want to check other stations out, we're not total Nazi radio people.

2368
02:55:50,180 --> 02:55:55,180
Go vote for them however you want to vote, but for us, vote a five.

2369
02:55:55,180 --> 02:55:56,180
Yes, vote five.

2370
02:55:56,180 --> 02:55:59,180
There is no choice, so if you have your little Live 365 window up...

2371
02:55:59,180 --> 02:56:01,180
There's other numbers that pretend and don't work, so hit five.

2372
02:56:01,180 --> 02:56:06,180
If you have your Live 365 window up right now, just change that little vote in the bottom to a five, and we would love that.

2373
02:56:06,180 --> 02:56:08,180
And we'll come to your house and have sex with you, just kidding.

2374
02:56:08,180 --> 02:56:10,180
No, we'll send the monkeys.

2375
02:56:10,180 --> 02:56:17,180
Rob can't see this, because Live 365 doesn't supply this kind of technology for him to see the IPs of the people voting.

2376
02:56:17,180 --> 02:56:27,180
But I can, because I have something that spikes in the middle and finds it, and so I can see who's voting bad, you know, and I will fucking blow up your computer. So don't vote anything low.

2377
02:56:27,180 --> 02:56:29,180
So send our leaked Shema grad after you.

2378
02:56:29,180 --> 02:56:34,180
I was just kidding, I can't. I'm a loser. I'm a fucking script kitty.

2379
02:56:34,180 --> 02:56:44,140
Well, that being said, our little help us be the high rated station as opposed to going

2380
02:56:44,140 --> 02:56:46,980
down the crapper where we've been going recently.

2381
02:56:46,980 --> 02:56:48,580
I think it's time to wrap up the show.

2382
02:56:48,580 --> 02:56:49,580
What do you guys say?

2383
02:56:49,580 --> 02:56:50,580
Sure.

2384
02:56:50,580 --> 02:56:51,580
What are we going to wrap it up in?

2385
02:56:51,580 --> 02:56:52,580
Ribbons and bows?

2386
02:56:52,580 --> 02:56:54,180
We're going to wrap it up in pretty pink paper.

2387
02:56:54,180 --> 02:56:55,580
Leather and pantyhose.

2388
02:56:55,580 --> 02:56:56,580
Yes.

2389
02:56:56,580 --> 02:56:57,580
Okay.

2390
02:56:57,580 --> 02:56:58,580
Final thought time.

2391
02:56:58,580 --> 02:56:59,580
Let's start with our guests.

2392
02:56:59,580 --> 02:57:00,580
Lanky style.

2393
02:57:00,580 --> 02:57:02,580
Your final thought, please.

2394
02:57:02,580 --> 02:57:05,580
Bye Bye Bye by NSYNC and DDR. What?

2395
02:57:07,580 --> 02:57:09,580
Rice Princess, your final thought?

2396
02:57:09,580 --> 02:57:11,580
Hi. And bye.

2397
02:57:12,580 --> 02:57:14,580
Loki, your final thought?

2398
02:57:15,580 --> 02:57:19,580
I'll get these films to work. It kills me.

2399
02:57:22,580 --> 02:57:25,580
My final thought is...

2400
02:57:27,580 --> 02:57:30,580
I don't know. That's my final thought. I just don't know anymore.

2401
02:57:30,580 --> 02:57:39,580
any more. Jamie? My final thought is give me money. And play Ragnarok on the chaos server.

2402
02:57:42,580 --> 02:57:51,580
Just play Ragnarok. Okay, so I'm trying to queue up the outro still, sorry. Does anybody

2403
02:57:51,580 --> 02:57:55,580
have an additional final thought? Yeah, I do. What? My frogs are cool, because they

2404
02:57:55,580 --> 02:58:03,500
cool because they have blue stars in them and my cat's butt stinks oh yay I

2405
02:58:03,500 --> 02:58:11,700
love your fortune cookie message okay and the final word of the show goes to

2406
02:58:11,700 --> 02:58:17,180
Jamie the final word of the night is

2407
02:58:17,380 --> 02:58:24,220
crack whore you've been listening to orange lounge radio orange lounge radio

2408
02:58:24,220 --> 02:58:27,460
It was hosted by Dark Sakura, Skye, and Loki.

2409
02:58:27,460 --> 02:58:29,740
We expect you a nice play again.

2410
02:58:29,740 --> 02:58:34,300
And now, here's your Fortune Cookie message of the day.

2411
02:58:34,300 --> 02:58:40,020
I inherited my father's eyes and my mother's eating disorder.

2412
02:58:40,020 --> 02:58:42,140
My mother and I have the same eating disorder.

2413
02:58:42,140 --> 02:58:46,980
She just said to me, when I was pregnant with you,

2414
02:58:46,980 --> 02:58:49,540
I eat only cherry.

2415
02:58:49,540 --> 02:58:53,980
And I think that you are just one big cherry.

2416
02:58:53,980 --> 02:59:00,980
You are just a one big gay kitty!

2417
02:59:05,800 --> 02:59:11,700
I was on the cover of The Star once, and it was for this thing called the Chow Like Cho Diet.

2418
02:59:11,700 --> 02:59:20,580
I was so fucking racist, because they just made this diet up. They didn't consult me. I mean, it was like this total diet that they made up that they said that I went on, and all these fake quotes from me.

2419
02:59:20,580 --> 02:59:24,220
When I was young, I was raised on rice and fish.

2420
02:59:24,220 --> 02:59:29,140
So when I get heavy, I go back to that natural Asian way of eating.

2421
02:59:29,140 --> 02:59:33,780
You can almost hear the mandolin in the background.

2422
02:59:33,780 --> 02:59:38,780
When I was a little girl and I grow up on the rice paddy,

2423
02:59:38,780 --> 02:59:44,260
we don't have any food because this was before Sally's brother.

2424
02:59:44,260 --> 03:00:01,260
So, we are so hungry all the time and we have no money and I want to go to the market to buy a chicken head but I have no money so I have to sell my finger.

2425
03:00:01,260 --> 03:00:12,260
But I was very hungry, but I still have a tendency to put on weight,

2426
03:00:12,260 --> 03:00:16,260
which is why I really hope that I catch malaria,

2427
03:00:16,260 --> 03:00:22,260
because that is a very good way to lose weight quickly, malaria and dysentery.

2428
03:00:22,260 --> 03:00:28,340
Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2429
03:00:52,260 --> 03:01:11,860
The afterbirth of Orange Lounge Radio.

2430
03:01:11,860 --> 03:01:12,860
Here we are.

2431
03:01:12,860 --> 03:01:13,860
So, what's up, kids?

2432
03:01:13,860 --> 03:01:14,860
Let me think.

2433
03:01:14,860 --> 03:01:15,860
Hi, monster.

2434
03:01:15,860 --> 03:01:16,860
You don't belong in this world.

2435
03:01:16,860 --> 03:01:17,860
You take them souls.

2436
03:01:17,860 --> 03:01:18,860
Invake them you're slaves.

2437
03:01:18,860 --> 03:01:22,860
You take them souls and make them your slaves!

2438
03:01:22,860 --> 03:01:25,860
Are you going to do that as a fortune cookie one week?

2439
03:01:25,860 --> 03:01:27,860
Same could be said of all religions.

2440
03:01:27,860 --> 03:01:31,860
I guess you're just going to act it out. I don't even know it. All I know is the die monster part.

2441
03:01:31,860 --> 03:01:33,860
And then the grim reaper.

2442
03:01:33,860 --> 03:01:34,860
I could do it from the beginning.

2443
03:01:34,860 --> 03:01:35,860
Do it! Do it!

2444
03:01:35,860 --> 03:01:37,860
Right now?

2445
03:01:37,860 --> 03:01:40,860
Actually there was supposed to be an ending where Maria turned evil.

2446
03:01:40,860 --> 03:01:44,860
The sound files on the game.

2447
03:01:44,860 --> 03:01:48,860
She's like, like, who would have thought such a little girl had so much power?

2448
03:01:48,860 --> 03:01:52,860
You know, but she's like the best.

2449
03:01:52,860 --> 03:01:56,860
And, um, I like the Grim Reaper part. Ah, I know God.

2450
03:01:56,860 --> 03:02:00,860
I love his voice. Okay, do the intro.

2451
03:02:00,860 --> 03:02:04,860
The Dark Priest Shaft.

2452
03:02:04,860 --> 03:02:08,860
Do the intro to Castlevania, please. Do it, Brad, do it.

2453
03:02:08,860 --> 03:02:12,860
Okay, I need to get my, like, wine glass and my

2454
03:02:12,860 --> 03:02:16,180
Dracula teeth, come on. I'm so excited.

2455
03:02:16,180 --> 03:02:19,540
Don't look at me, everybody look around. Don't look at me.

2456
03:02:19,540 --> 03:02:23,340
Die, monster. You don't belong in this world.

2457
03:02:23,340 --> 03:02:26,300
Somebody else has to do the Dracula part.

2458
03:02:26,300 --> 03:02:29,900
I don't know the Dracula part, so you just have to do your Dracula voice.

2459
03:02:29,900 --> 03:02:34,280
It was not by my hand that I was once again given flesh.

2460
03:02:34,280 --> 03:02:39,060
I was brought here by humans who used to wish to pay me tribute.

2461
03:02:39,060 --> 03:02:43,060
Trueboot, you steal men's souls and make them your slaves.

2462
03:02:43,060 --> 03:02:46,060
Perhaps the same could be said of all religions.

2463
03:02:46,060 --> 03:02:49,060
Your words are as empty as your soul.

2464
03:02:49,060 --> 03:02:52,060
Mankind ill needs a savior such as you.

2465
03:02:52,060 --> 03:02:53,060
What is a man?

2466
03:02:53,060 --> 03:02:55,060
For a little wine glass.

2467
03:02:55,060 --> 03:02:57,060
A miserable little pile of secrets.

2468
03:02:57,060 --> 03:03:00,060
But enough talk, how about you?

2469
03:03:00,060 --> 03:03:02,060
Yay, that's beautiful.

2470
03:03:02,060 --> 03:03:06,060
That is the best dialogue out of any video game ever in the history of mankind.

2471
03:03:06,060 --> 03:03:08,060
The acting is perfect, I don't care what you think.

2472
03:03:08,060 --> 03:03:09,060
Here, what do you think?

2473
03:03:09,060 --> 03:03:12,060
Loki, can you make a remix using those lines?

2474
03:03:12,060 --> 03:03:15,060
That's why you wanted me to do it.

2475
03:03:15,060 --> 03:03:18,060
I knew, I should have known that's why you wanted me to do that.

2476
03:03:18,060 --> 03:03:20,060
Brad's voice in the game.

2477
03:03:20,060 --> 03:03:22,060
I've got, I could give you the whole thing in Japanese.

2478
03:03:22,060 --> 03:03:24,060
Die, monster.

2479
03:03:24,060 --> 03:03:25,060
Die, monster.

2480
03:03:25,060 --> 03:03:31,060
I should, I should, I should actually copy off my Japanese one too and play it for you.

2481
03:03:31,060 --> 03:03:34,060
Dude, it sounds really, really cool.

2482
03:03:34,060 --> 03:03:39,060
I might do something like that, but unfortunately, my name starts with an M.

2483
03:03:43,060 --> 03:03:44,060
What?

2484
03:03:44,060 --> 03:03:45,060
What?

2485
03:03:45,060 --> 03:03:54,060
In other words, I'm not a person that also has four letters in their name, begins with a T, ends with a win, and makes stupid remixes, so there.

2486
03:03:54,060 --> 03:03:56,060
Okay, then I'll do it.

2487
03:03:56,060 --> 03:04:00,060
Hey, you know what that is backwards? It's Newt.

2488
03:04:00,060 --> 03:04:08,380
Well now, I'm going to make a remix called the beauty of silence mix and it's just going

2489
03:04:08,380 --> 03:04:13,500
to go the beauty of silence and then like a minute of silence and I'm going to say see

2490
03:04:13,500 --> 03:04:14,500
it's beautiful.

2491
03:04:14,500 --> 03:04:22,220
So half in the background, too pretty.

2492
03:04:22,220 --> 03:04:26,700
And then like sex noises in the back and kittens getting choked.

2493
03:04:26,700 --> 03:04:27,700
Just kidding.

2494
03:04:27,700 --> 03:04:33,700
Oh, do you want to give a plug to going to vote for Shermie?

2495
03:04:33,700 --> 03:04:42,700
I put Shermie's picture up on RateMyKitten.com, but it's not up there yet and I actually don't know where her site is for her picture.

2496
03:04:42,700 --> 03:04:45,700
So she's just on there somewhere.

2497
03:04:45,700 --> 03:04:52,700
It's a picture of Shermie on Mel's lap being sleepy and cute.

2498
03:04:52,700 --> 03:04:54,700
Yay.

2499
03:04:54,700 --> 03:04:58,700
Okay, so does anybody else have anything they want to say for the wrap-up here?

2500
03:04:58,700 --> 03:05:00,700
The afterbirth?

2501
03:05:00,700 --> 03:05:01,700
Yes.

2502
03:05:01,700 --> 03:05:03,700
I'm fucking hungry, man.

2503
03:05:03,700 --> 03:05:05,700
There's a bunch of snack foods up there.

2504
03:05:05,700 --> 03:05:07,700
I don't want snack foods. I want a meal!

2505
03:05:07,700 --> 03:05:08,700
You're on a diet.

2506
03:05:08,700 --> 03:05:11,700
No, I just want a meal. I'm tired of eating all these sneaky snacks and stuff.

2507
03:05:11,700 --> 03:05:13,700
Aw, poor thing.

2508
03:05:13,700 --> 03:05:14,700
I know, poor thing.

2509
03:05:14,700 --> 03:05:16,700
You can eat my dick.

2510
03:05:16,700 --> 03:05:19,700
Oh, God, that's too many calories.

2511
03:05:19,700 --> 03:05:24,700
It's sweet. I promise you it's sweet. It's full of fat. And high-end fiber.

2512
03:05:28,700 --> 03:05:33,700
Alright, kids. What, did somebody fart or something? You all have played your...

2513
03:05:35,700 --> 03:05:40,700
Wait, yes, Loki? Loki has something he'd like to share with you all. I'm scared.

2514
03:05:43,700 --> 03:05:48,700
We just had like a bunch of radio silence. I know. Mumble, mumble, mumble.

2515
03:05:48,700 --> 03:05:54,700
such great radio here. That's bullshit.

2516
03:05:54,700 --> 03:06:00,700
Are you trying to do the poodle hat thing? You want to play a poodle hat track?

2517
03:06:00,700 --> 03:06:05,700
Okay, Loki wants to play a poodle hat track for you all.

2518
03:06:05,700 --> 03:06:11,700
A hat rack? What?

2519
03:06:11,700 --> 03:06:16,700
It's quiet. Yeah, I know. This is shitty radio.

2520
03:06:16,700 --> 03:06:22,700
You talk. I do too much talking. People complain that I talk too much, so I'm dumb.

2521
03:06:22,700 --> 03:06:25,700
Why do you talk too much? Shut up. You know what I mean.

2522
03:06:25,700 --> 03:06:32,700
People visit our live journal, everybody visit our forums, everybody vote us a five, listen to us all day long.

2523
03:06:32,700 --> 03:06:47,420
Look, if you had one shot to sit on your lazy butt and watch all the TV you ever wanted

2524
03:06:47,420 --> 03:06:53,420
until your brain turned to mush, would you go for it or just let it slip?

2525
03:06:53,420 --> 03:06:53,920
Yo

2526
03:07:23,420 --> 03:07:27,420
Insanity, oh, the fat crappin' Behold, of depravity, no

2527
03:07:27,420 --> 03:07:31,420
They live happily, yo, cross the alley To show and celebrity mold

2528
03:07:31,420 --> 03:07:35,420
Oh, the van and the coal Keep scaring me, look, monocavity

2529
03:07:35,420 --> 03:07:38,420
Oh, it's a station break Better go out to the kitchen or microwave salt

2530
03:07:38,420 --> 03:07:42,420
I'm gonna lose with your mom watchin' TV They told me they told me

2531
03:07:42,420 --> 03:07:47,420
But I still do it in every show Like they will be C-SPAN, TV, Landon, HBO

2532
03:07:47,420 --> 03:07:51,420
The travel channel is gonna burn in lifetime I'm gonna lose with your mom watchin' TV

2533
03:07:51,420 --> 03:07:55,420
I'm watching TV, they told me, they told me, turn off all music videos

2534
03:07:55,420 --> 03:07:58,420
I'm gonna watch C-SPAN TV, land in HBO

2535
03:07:58,420 --> 03:08:01,420
Stay up through channel 9, QVC, a lifetime power

2536
03:08:01,420 --> 03:08:04,420
My blood is aching, as I watch NASCAR racing

2537
03:08:04,420 --> 03:08:07,420
That show about undertaking, where it came

2538
03:08:07,420 --> 03:08:11,420
The 24 to line order, the weather channel's boring

2539
03:08:11,420 --> 03:08:14,420
Like 50 minutes of ancient reporters

2540
03:08:14,420 --> 03:08:16,420
Next up aren't you through Hollywood story

2541
03:08:16,420 --> 03:08:19,420
The rise and decline of pro actors in glory

2542
03:08:19,420 --> 03:08:22,100
It goes for next fall, they already been namin'

2543
03:08:22,100 --> 03:08:24,820
This is D.S.I. gravy, touched by an uncle

2544
03:08:24,820 --> 03:08:26,340
But it sounds pretty lamin'

2545
03:08:26,340 --> 03:08:29,140
So does everybody tolerate Raymond

2546
03:08:29,140 --> 03:08:31,860
And King of Queens jumped the shark the first minute

2547
03:08:31,860 --> 03:08:34,620
I can't believe Richard Simmons ain't in it

2548
03:08:34,620 --> 03:08:36,900
I'll move right on the way to Central Rules

2549
03:08:36,900 --> 03:08:38,780
So where's my teenage daughter?

2550
03:08:38,780 --> 03:08:41,020
Then I bet I watch The Bachelorette

2551
03:08:41,020 --> 03:08:42,780
Followed by Welcome Back Potter

2552
03:08:42,780 --> 03:08:44,020
And The Muppet Show

2553
03:08:44,020 --> 03:08:44,780
Where they goin'

2554
03:08:44,780 --> 03:08:46,540
And I'm all gonna use your mind

2555
03:08:46,540 --> 03:08:48,820
Watchin' TV, they told me they told me

2556
03:08:48,820 --> 03:08:50,420
But I still do it in every show

2557
03:08:50,420 --> 03:08:53,580
Like Gable, G-SPAN, TV Land, and HBO

2558
03:08:53,580 --> 03:08:56,140
They're just in channel in the A&E and Lifetime

2559
03:08:56,140 --> 03:08:58,420
You're gonna lose your mind watching TV

2560
03:08:58,420 --> 03:08:59,820
They told me, cuz told me

2561
03:08:59,820 --> 03:09:01,420
But after last year's I could go

2562
03:09:01,420 --> 03:09:04,620
I'm making a G-SPAN, TV Land, and HBO

2563
03:09:04,620 --> 03:09:07,020
The type of channeling for a TV lifetime

2564
03:09:07,020 --> 03:09:10,020
Never gonna miss another place I lost in space

2565
03:09:10,020 --> 03:09:12,820
I've seen each amazing race without a trace

2566
03:09:12,820 --> 03:09:15,620
But I only watched Willie race one time, one day

2567
03:09:15,620 --> 03:09:18,220
Wish I hadn't, cuz G-bo, now peace I'm gay

2568
03:09:18,220 --> 03:09:21,080
Oh, and here's a factor I watched maybe a h-hour

2569
03:09:21,080 --> 03:09:23,880
After that, felt like I needed a long shower

2570
03:09:23,880 --> 03:09:26,620
Network execs with naked ambitions

2571
03:09:26,620 --> 03:09:29,320
Next week on Fox, watch Lion be Christian

2572
03:09:29,320 --> 03:09:32,120
Life's a tie-up, don't program any planners

2573
03:09:32,120 --> 03:09:36,320
Make them watch all of that junk till their heads explode just like scanners

2574
03:09:36,320 --> 03:09:39,120
Reach covered gravity, you fool of survivors

2575
03:09:39,120 --> 03:09:41,820
Look at James Whitten discussing the Uber

2576
03:09:41,820 --> 03:09:45,020
Of Mr. Rob Schneider and the Gilligan in Spongebob, but

2577
03:09:45,020 --> 03:09:50,520
Where's my guy Baranci, Leno, who's got Madonna, haters, Luke, Terry, and a special all-pick Latin episode

2578
03:09:50,520 --> 03:09:52,520
It's Drew Carey, why'd I turn out his teeth?

2579
03:09:52,520 --> 03:09:55,320
Cuz I'm a gossip freak, and I gotta know who J-Lo is

2580
03:09:55,320 --> 03:09:57,820
Cuz Mary-Anne is weak, a thirty second plot

2581
03:09:57,820 --> 03:10:01,820
Now looking back to R.U. Pot, I was fine and I'm recording the Sopranos

2582
03:10:01,820 --> 03:10:04,920
Ooh, I forgot, I left your whisper without a plot

2583
03:10:04,920 --> 03:10:07,720
I'll stare at all my legs in love, my eyes bloodshot

2584
03:10:07,720 --> 03:10:10,520
Because I'm only a guy with one brain to write

2585
03:10:10,520 --> 03:10:13,020
I'm gonna spend my life rockin' television, so why?

2586
03:10:13,020 --> 03:10:15,360
If you're gonna use it you're all watchin' TV

2587
03:10:15,360 --> 03:10:16,560
They told me they told me

2588
03:10:16,560 --> 03:10:18,200
But I've still the one in every show

2589
03:10:18,200 --> 03:10:20,180
I gave a big speech band in TV

2590
03:10:20,180 --> 03:10:21,420
Lined in HBO

2591
03:10:21,420 --> 03:10:23,220
Helped fight with Channel and AMC

2592
03:10:23,220 --> 03:10:24,560
And lifetime goes

2593
03:10:24,560 --> 03:10:26,280
Use if you're my watchin' TV

2594
03:10:26,280 --> 03:10:27,340
They told me, they told me

2595
03:10:27,340 --> 03:10:29,380
Turn up like Oprah with your show

2596
03:10:29,380 --> 03:10:31,140
I gave a large speech band in TV

2597
03:10:31,140 --> 03:10:32,440
Lined in HBO

2598
03:10:32,440 --> 03:10:34,260
Helped learn to channel and AMC

2599
03:10:34,260 --> 03:10:35,560
And lifetime goes

2600
03:10:35,560 --> 03:10:47,960
Good dear lord, this is like the longest afterbirth ever.

2601
03:10:47,960 --> 03:10:52,320
That's okay though, right?

2602
03:10:52,320 --> 03:10:55,160
Anything else want to be said about Weird Al or anything?

2603
03:10:55,160 --> 03:10:56,160
Yes.

2604
03:10:56,160 --> 03:10:57,160
What?

2605
03:10:57,160 --> 03:10:58,160
Woah!

2606
03:10:58,160 --> 03:10:59,160
Woah!

2607
03:10:59,160 --> 03:11:05,480
Alright, before we murder your eardrums further, I think it's time to put the proverbial bullet
