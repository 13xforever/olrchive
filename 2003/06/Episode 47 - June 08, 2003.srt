1
00:00:08,177 --> 00:00:12,360
[SPEAKER_17]: Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

2
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:20,827
[SPEAKER_27]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, for Monty Talk and then some.

3
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:24,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

4
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,654
[SPEAKER_27]: Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

5
00:00:29,214 --> 00:00:33,978
[SPEAKER_27]: Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

6
00:00:34,608 --> 00:00:38,355
[SPEAKER_27]: You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:38,636 --> 00:00:40,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I will spank your child.

8
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:42,262
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

9
00:00:44,887 --> 00:00:45,048
[SPEAKER_13]: Well...

10
00:00:47,952 --> 00:00:49,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my big opening.

11
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:50,734
[SPEAKER_08]: A sphincter says what?

12
00:00:50,914 --> 00:00:53,035
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm super, thanks for asking.

13
00:00:53,395 --> 00:00:55,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you little bitch trove from hell.

14
00:00:56,016 --> 00:00:57,657
[SPEAKER_08]: What am I doing here?

15
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:59,658
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

16
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:01,219
[SPEAKER_14]: Dodge this.

17
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,560
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a tasty burger.

18
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.

19
00:01:06,462 --> 00:01:07,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I have.

20
00:01:07,522 --> 00:01:09,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Look, there's a flesh wound.

21
00:01:09,564 --> 00:01:15,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a polyshorum.

22
00:01:16,753 --> 00:01:17,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah?

23
00:01:17,694 --> 00:01:20,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

24
00:01:21,236 --> 00:01:22,296
[SPEAKER_26]: DarkSakura.

25
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:23,357
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a sniff.

26
00:01:23,637 --> 00:01:24,217
[SPEAKER_26]: Skye.

27
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:26,378
[SPEAKER_26]: But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

28
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:27,279
[SPEAKER_26]: Loki.

29
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,520
[SPEAKER_26]: I hate you!

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,981
[SPEAKER_26]: Orange Lounge Radio.

31
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:37,685
[SPEAKER_02]: We are live, and this is episode number 48 for June the 8th of 2003.

32
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:44,929
[SPEAKER_02]: You're tuned in to the Beemani Scene's most bitchy radio station of all things Beemani.

33
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:48,116
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

34
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:51,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.

35
00:01:51,317 --> 00:01:54,298
[SPEAKER_02]: In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Jamie.

36
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:55,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss Summers, if you're nasty.

37
00:01:55,538 --> 00:01:56,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up, I'm watching Transformers.

38
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,299
[SPEAKER_02]: You know her better as DarkSakura.

39
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,520
[SPEAKER_02]: In that corner, say hello to our TechMassa Loki.

40
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

41
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,201
[SPEAKER_02]: I lied, you guys.

42
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:07,841
[SPEAKER_02]: This is episode number 47, not 48.

43
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:08,081
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad.

44
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:08,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost count.

45
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:09,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.

46
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:15,887
[SPEAKER_02]: So what?

47
00:02:16,108 --> 00:02:17,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody makes mistakes.

48
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:17,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave me alone.

49
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Go away.

50
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:20,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Die.

51
00:02:22,873 --> 00:02:25,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Also with us tonight, say hello to nobody.

52
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:28,997
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

53
00:02:29,577 --> 00:02:29,998
[SPEAKER_02]: It's empty.

54
00:02:30,058 --> 00:02:32,179
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a ghost town here in Orange Lounge Radio headquarters.

55
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:36,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody loves Orange Lounge Radio anymore.

56
00:02:37,723 --> 00:02:38,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a cry.

57
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:41,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I missed it.

58
00:02:42,423 --> 00:02:45,785
[SPEAKER_05]: They showed, like, the crappiest Transformers, though, when they showed the commercials.

59
00:02:45,906 --> 00:02:48,928
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're getting phone calls as if we could, like, take calls on the show.

60
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:50,069
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting more carrots.

61
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,430
[SPEAKER_02]: How rude.

62
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,432
[SPEAKER_05]: I am being a good girl today.

63
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,033
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you being a good girl?

64
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:55,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm eating carrots.

65
00:02:57,836 --> 00:02:58,656
[SPEAKER_02]: As opposed to?

66
00:02:59,337 --> 00:03:00,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Eating candy.

67
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:02,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty.

68
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:10,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll be talking to us, ourselves, since there's no guests here, we'll just be talking to ourselves a little later.

69
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:17,609
[SPEAKER_02]: And first, we're going to take a quick break, though, featuring some five key songs.

70
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

71
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:24,253
[SPEAKER_02]: And this first song is called Waterflame, and it's by Kay.

72
00:03:25,314 --> 00:03:31,617
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, a buddy of mine, Navi, who's been on the show before, he picked up the Kay album not too long ago.

73
00:03:31,677 --> 00:03:32,298
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool.

74
00:03:32,538 --> 00:03:32,718
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.

75
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:33,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

76
00:03:34,522 --> 00:03:36,525
[SPEAKER_02]: So, lots of fun stuff coming up tonight.

77
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:39,490
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do listless tonight because we haven't done it in forever.

78
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:41,993
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah.

79
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:43,676
[SPEAKER_02]: So, enjoy.

80
00:03:43,776 --> 00:03:44,257
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back.

81
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:05,513
Thanks for watching!

82
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:46,111
[SPEAKER_13]: In the city where neon lights shine, that person left a shadow and disappeared.

83
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:48,814
[SPEAKER_13]: Suddenly, he said goodbye and said he loved me.

84
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:52,837
[SPEAKER_13]: At that time, I realized that memories are in dreams.

85
00:06:52,857 --> 00:06:54,458
[SPEAKER_13]: They wake up when they're forgotten.

86
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:14,836
[SPEAKER_13]: I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

87
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:19,632
[SPEAKER_13]: I do it, I do it

88
00:08:57,521 --> 00:08:59,923
[SPEAKER_27]: It's more contagious than SARS.

89
00:09:01,405 --> 00:09:03,267
[SPEAKER_27]: It's Orange Lounge Radio.

90
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:04,888
[SPEAKER_27]: That's right.

91
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:06,830
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

92
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:10,774
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just listened to a whole bunch of 5 key songs.

93
00:09:11,174 --> 00:09:11,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't you enjoy that?

94
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:16,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Athletics with Disco Dog from 7th Mix.

95
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Before that, Love to Me.

96
00:09:18,161 --> 00:09:19,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Athletics did Please Don't Go.

97
00:09:19,943 --> 00:09:20,343
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

98
00:09:20,423 --> 00:09:21,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Athletics also did War Game, right?

99
00:09:22,392 --> 00:09:22,712
[SPEAKER_05]: I think.

100
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:28,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Before that, the Japanese version of Love to Me, as it's easily called, from Third Mix.

101
00:09:28,576 --> 00:09:29,256
[SPEAKER_02]: That's debatable.

102
00:09:30,777 --> 00:09:39,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Before that, GTS featuring Melody Sexton from Fourth Mix, Brand New World, and starting that off, K from Seventh Mix with Water Flames.

103
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:41,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't get my single propeller open.

104
00:09:41,344 --> 00:09:43,325
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like that Margaret Cho joke.

105
00:09:43,385 --> 00:09:44,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Water's flame.

106
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,861
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's pretty mellow here tonight.

107
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:50,822
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really have a whole lot going on.

108
00:09:51,662 --> 00:09:55,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot going on in the land of Orange Lounge Radio this week.

109
00:09:55,664 --> 00:09:59,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, there were a lot of changes that happened at the station on June 1st.

110
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:01,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully they've been invisible to you.

111
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:04,915
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been some positive changes and there's been some negative changes.

112
00:10:05,135 --> 00:10:06,575
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is all due to Live365.

113
00:10:07,135 --> 00:10:10,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Positive changes, we've been given a lot more web space.

114
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:13,856
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we're gonna add a whole bunch of new songs.

115
00:10:14,076 --> 00:10:17,397
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Jamie brought me a whole bunch of new stuff to add into the normal playlist.

116
00:10:17,437 --> 00:10:18,537
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get to hear it all tonight.

117
00:10:19,338 --> 00:10:20,158
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, yes.

118
00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:22,358
[SPEAKER_28]: I've got some good news and bad news.

119
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:26,439
[SPEAKER_28]: The good news is, I saved lots of money by calling Geico.

120
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:29,660
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck is that?

121
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,180
[SPEAKER_28]: You're an idiot.

122
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,660
[SPEAKER_28]: Shut up.

123
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:31,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

124
00:10:33,902 --> 00:10:37,324
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, we're going to have a whole bunch of new stuff in rotation of Monty Music and more.

125
00:10:37,764 --> 00:10:39,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad news is, and this is the weird thing.

126
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:40,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know it's gone.

127
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:41,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I drank all my Propel.

128
00:10:41,946 --> 00:10:42,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

129
00:10:43,046 --> 00:10:44,867
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the interesting part.

130
00:10:45,347 --> 00:10:48,829
[SPEAKER_02]: They're capping how many live listeners we can have at once.

131
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,831
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's capped right now.

132
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:54,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're going to cap our listeners.

133
00:10:55,692 --> 00:11:00,375
[SPEAKER_02]: It's capped right now when we're live at a number which we've only hit during one show ever.

134
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:00,935
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

135
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:04,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't want to say on air, but it's that many times this many.

136
00:11:07,776 --> 00:11:09,757
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've only ever hit that number once.

137
00:11:10,157 --> 00:11:20,442
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's going to happen is if we ever hit that number again, what's going to happen when you try to connect to the station where we're live, it's going to go, we're sorry, but this station is too popular and you have to be a preferred member.

138
00:11:20,842 --> 00:11:22,562
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sorry, but you have SARS.

139
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:23,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.

140
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:26,324
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get that message, we're going to be aware of it that we've hit our cap.

141
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:29,205
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we'll do for the next week, we'll increase our cap.

142
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:32,707
[SPEAKER_02]: We just don't want to have to pay any more money unless we have to, but we don't want our listeners to pay.

143
00:11:33,147 --> 00:11:34,147
[SPEAKER_05]: We're cheap bitches.

144
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:34,688
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

145
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:36,048
[SPEAKER_05]: But we take donations.

146
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:37,929
[SPEAKER_05]: You can send us via PayPal.

147
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:45,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here's the next question is that they go, well, if you don't like all of my 365 rules, why don't you go through Shoutcast?

148
00:11:45,552 --> 00:11:47,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Shoutcast is the suck.

149
00:11:47,252 --> 00:11:49,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not necessarily that Shoutcast sucks.

150
00:11:49,513 --> 00:11:51,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for talk radio, it's actually pretty good.

151
00:11:52,014 --> 00:11:54,015
[SPEAKER_02]: But, this is the problem.

152
00:11:54,055 --> 00:11:55,035
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the sucky part.

153
00:11:55,296 --> 00:11:55,936
[SPEAKER_02]: We play music.

154
00:11:56,756 --> 00:11:59,238
[SPEAKER_02]: and the music part, you get into that whole licensing thing.

155
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you could get into like, oh, well, you know, you're doing Konami a favor here, blah, blah, blah.

156
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think Konami cares.

157
00:12:07,404 --> 00:12:12,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Konami cares the station exists either, but let's just not take chances, especially because we bring you a lot of dance media stuff.

158
00:12:12,988 --> 00:12:18,772
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing being is that if we ran a ShotKast server, all the bandwidth would have to come off our personal line here at the house.

159
00:12:19,253 --> 00:12:24,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, but I'm too busy downloading porn to run a radio station off the computers here.

160
00:12:25,322 --> 00:12:26,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm too busy downloading Transformers.

161
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:29,226
[SPEAKER_02]: We hope you have a summer to remember.

162
00:12:43,877 --> 00:12:46,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Now let's have an update on our... I'm reading your apartment thing.

163
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, our apartment is so lame.

164
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:49,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read this.

165
00:12:49,662 --> 00:12:50,743
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to read the apartment thing?

166
00:12:50,763 --> 00:12:51,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Make a splash this summer.

167
00:12:52,264 --> 00:12:58,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether your idea of fun is heading out to the ballpark, lounging by the pool, or watching a spectacular sunset, we hope you have a summer to remember.

168
00:12:59,191 --> 00:12:59,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy!

169
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:03,975
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have a list down there where you can sign up to watch rattlesnakes.

170
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:05,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I kid you not.

171
00:13:06,397 --> 00:13:06,977
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

172
00:13:06,997 --> 00:13:08,218
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to watch them rattle?

173
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:09,039
[SPEAKER_02]: What would they do?

174
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you eat them?

175
00:13:12,546 --> 00:13:13,667
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see here.

176
00:13:14,008 --> 00:13:33,382
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, yeah, we've got... Sign up in the fitness room for tennis, singles, doubles, Friday night, round robin, walking, running, biking, swimming, weightlifting, slash yoga, canoeing, slash kayaking, slash hang gliding, cards, slash computer games, rattlesnake watching.

177
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,684
[SPEAKER_28]: Seriously, have we left anything out?

178
00:13:37,062 --> 00:13:37,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, hang gliding.

179
00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:39,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I can pretend like I'm in Pilotwings.

180
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:42,106
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really, really suck in Pilotwings.

181
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:47,331
[SPEAKER_05]: But, but, yeah, they don't have, like, rifle shooting.

182
00:13:48,612 --> 00:13:49,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Skeet shooting.

183
00:13:49,353 --> 00:13:50,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Skeet shooting.

184
00:13:50,794 --> 00:13:53,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody remember that movie, Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead?

185
00:13:53,997 --> 00:13:54,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

186
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:55,558
[SPEAKER_02]: The dishes are done, man.

187
00:13:55,598 --> 00:13:56,899
[SPEAKER_02]: They're done, man.

188
00:13:57,099 --> 00:13:58,040
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the best.

189
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, that movie was the shit.

190
00:13:59,401 --> 00:14:00,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why I'm thinking about that.

191
00:14:00,242 --> 00:14:03,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I just feel like when she shot the guy in the pants with the water gun, it looked like he pissed himself.

192
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm thinking of that movie today because I saw Christina Applegate in the commercial.

193
00:14:09,434 --> 00:14:12,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so now we had our update with what's going on live 365.

194
00:14:12,637 --> 00:14:13,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get our update with the host.

195
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:14,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, how was your week?

196
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:16,180
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a week.

197
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,461
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked.

198
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:20,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happily getting some overtime now.

199
00:14:21,144 --> 00:14:21,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

200
00:14:21,985 --> 00:14:22,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy.

201
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything Mamani related?

202
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:27,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I suck at 2DX now.

203
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:28,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you suck at 2DX?

204
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:31,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm like a month out of serious practice.

205
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:34,596
[SPEAKER_05]: and I hurt my foot on DDR.

206
00:14:35,456 --> 00:14:37,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that using the pad that I have?

207
00:14:38,237 --> 00:14:39,498
[SPEAKER_05]: That was playing at the arcade.

208
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:40,478
[SPEAKER_05]: It was my butt foot.

209
00:14:40,718 --> 00:14:43,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Since then, like, my left foot's been swollen and it hasn't fit in my shoe.

210
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you been playing with my new dance pad?

211
00:14:46,461 --> 00:14:48,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And I use the term my new dance pad.

212
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:49,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet.

213
00:14:49,182 --> 00:14:49,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

214
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:51,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, over 30 days.

215
00:14:51,943 --> 00:14:52,444
[SPEAKER_05]: It's legal.

216
00:14:53,464 --> 00:14:55,085
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole lot of other drama going on there.

217
00:14:55,105 --> 00:14:55,705
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't get into it.

218
00:14:59,764 --> 00:14:59,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cry.

219
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:00,124
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

220
00:15:00,144 --> 00:15:01,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'd have that on VHS anyway.

221
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,962
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

222
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Some joke that was.

223
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:02,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, let me tell them.

224
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:03,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretend it was funny.

225
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:05,201
[SPEAKER_29]: Can you pretend it was funny for me?

226
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:08,482
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the most hilarious thing I've ever experienced, ever!

227
00:16:10,022 --> 00:16:10,503
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

228
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:13,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge practical jokes and bloopers.

229
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this is what happened.

230
00:16:15,304 --> 00:16:19,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki made a brand new remix, and we're going to premiere it for you guys probably during the next break, right?

231
00:16:19,765 --> 00:16:20,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes?

232
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:20,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Sound good to me?

233
00:16:21,025 --> 00:16:21,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

234
00:16:21,385 --> 00:16:22,365
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll introduce that.

235
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:25,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess I have to tell you what it is in order to...

236
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:27,070
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

237
00:16:42,634 --> 00:17:00,947
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened is that Loki left, he went somewhere, he went to go over to his girlfriend's or something, and he left IRC in Orange Lounge up, and I kind of was just like looking, because sometimes I do that, you know, I'll see, oh, is there anybody talking in Orange Lounge right now, should I set myself back from away and join in the chat or whatever, and I saw that Loki had said, hey, I finished this new mix, da-da-da-da-da.

238
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,353
[SPEAKER_02]: And Brad and Irene were over here, you know, Rice, Princess, and LankyStyle were over here.

239
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:09,297
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, like Brad, being a big Loki fanboy, was like, oh, I gotta hear that remix.

240
00:17:09,337 --> 00:17:14,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, okay, well now that Loki and I live together, let me just get on the network and access Loki's computer and find it.

241
00:17:15,082 --> 00:17:16,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know where he keeps all his remixes.

242
00:17:17,063 --> 00:17:18,164
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went in there and played it.

243
00:17:18,264 --> 00:17:20,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, and that's when I found out, okay, it's Rob Zombie, it's Gravity.

244
00:17:21,647 --> 00:17:23,349
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm getting to a point here, trust me.

245
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:23,929
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

246
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:33,152
[SPEAKER_02]: When Loki finally gets home, he walks through the door and I get him, I'm like, oh my god, Burmani style, they're having a new remix contest, and I heard the most awesome entry.

247
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:37,993
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, somebody mixed Gravity with Rom Zombie, and it's called the Twin Burnination Mix.

248
00:17:40,534 --> 00:17:42,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki was not of the amused, but I was.

249
00:17:45,115 --> 00:17:48,256
[SPEAKER_28]: The joke fell on his face before I stepped in the door.

250
00:17:48,636 --> 00:17:53,557
[SPEAKER_28]: It was just like, guess what, I heard this new remix, right away I knew what was going on.

251
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping that Loki would be too silly to realize that, you know, oh, he might have gone on my computer and did it.

252
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:03,882
[SPEAKER_02]: But see, Loki knows I'm a big old snoop.

253
00:18:03,942 --> 00:18:06,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, no, I wouldn't look at anything else, just his remixes.

254
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:08,623
[SPEAKER_02]: He wouldn't share anything else on his computer, I'm sure.

255
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:10,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I'm porn.

256
00:18:10,744 --> 00:18:12,304
[SPEAKER_02]: You do have your porn shared, right?

257
00:18:13,765 --> 00:18:15,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no, it's not shared, sorry.

258
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:17,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Poor Rob.

259
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:19,203
[SPEAKER_02]: You're so mean to me.

260
00:18:19,623 --> 00:18:19,903
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

261
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:21,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

262
00:18:21,084 --> 00:18:21,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Heteroporn.

263
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:22,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Heteroporn.

264
00:18:22,965 --> 00:18:24,206
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't be interested in that.

265
00:18:24,366 --> 00:18:24,986
[SPEAKER_04]: They're funny.

266
00:18:25,366 --> 00:18:26,567
[SPEAKER_02]: True or false.

267
00:18:26,627 --> 00:18:27,988
[SPEAKER_02]: There is dick in heteroporn.

268
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:29,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Some heteroporn.

269
00:18:31,691 --> 00:18:32,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

270
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:37,094
[SPEAKER_05]: And where did the, what was that?

271
00:18:37,714 --> 00:18:38,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Ellie McFeel.

272
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:40,890
[SPEAKER_02]: What about Adam McFeel?

273
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,712
[SPEAKER_02]: That was funny.

274
00:18:43,972 --> 00:18:47,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Rice Princess and Lanky Style are getting through a friend at Rocky Horror.

275
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:48,816
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been getting all these pornos.

276
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:50,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Ally McFeel, Horror of the Rings.

277
00:18:50,757 --> 00:18:54,961
[SPEAKER_02]: You know Q. You know Q. Q, the guy that looks like Striker's son from X2.

278
00:18:55,201 --> 00:19:00,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw the DVD exchange hands after the pate thing.

279
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:01,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see X2?

280
00:19:02,647 --> 00:19:02,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

281
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:04,108
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember Striker's son?

282
00:19:04,568 --> 00:19:04,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

283
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:05,069
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Q.

284
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:10,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god!

285
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure No?

286
00:19:30,718 --> 00:19:32,600
[SPEAKER_05]: The Dark Sakura Burnination Mix

287
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:05,921
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, this is bad.

288
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:06,602
Here is justice.

289
00:20:06,642 --> 00:20:07,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Here is punishment.

290
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:08,184
This is fucked up.

291
00:20:08,224 --> 00:20:08,765
This is fucked up.

292
00:20:34,006 --> 00:20:35,037
[SPEAKER_11]: This is fucked up!

293
00:21:12,043 --> 00:21:13,044
Oh, this is bad.

294
00:21:13,104 --> 00:21:13,624
Oh, this is bad.

295
00:21:13,724 --> 00:21:14,205
Oh, this is bad.

296
00:21:14,245 --> 00:21:14,865
Oh, this is bad.

297
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:15,886
Oh, this is bad.

298
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:16,786
Oh, this is bad.

299
00:21:16,846 --> 00:21:17,387
Oh, this is bad.

300
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:18,047
Oh, this is bad.

301
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:18,968
This is fucked up.

302
00:21:19,188 --> 00:21:19,748
Here is justice.

303
00:21:19,788 --> 00:21:20,309
Here is punishment.

304
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:20,529
Here.

305
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:21,109
This is fucked up.

306
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:21,550
Here is justice.

307
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:10,350
This is fucked up.

308
00:22:11,032 --> 00:22:11,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, hi.

309
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:13,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, that was fucked up.

310
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:15,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Loki vs. Tack featuring Rob Zombie.

311
00:22:15,864 --> 00:22:16,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Gravity!

312
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,931
[SPEAKER_02]: The DarkSakura Burnination Mix.

313
00:22:20,612 --> 00:22:24,375
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's say hello to our new guest that just arrived during that little song.

314
00:22:25,036 --> 00:22:25,276
[SPEAKER_02]: New?

315
00:22:25,897 --> 00:22:26,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know.

316
00:22:26,377 --> 00:22:27,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a noob.

317
00:22:27,098 --> 00:22:27,778
[SPEAKER_02]: You're new tonight.

318
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:28,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

319
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,920
[SPEAKER_02]: It's new!

320
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:31,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, LankyStyle.

321
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:33,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up, guy?

322
00:22:33,363 --> 00:22:40,590
[SPEAKER_02]: See, the reason why we played that is I was telling the story about Oracle's practical jokes and bloopers about how I joked with Loki last night and said it wasn't funny at all.

323
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:41,651
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was funny to me.

324
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:42,091
[SPEAKER_03]: I laughed.

325
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:42,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Not last night.

326
00:22:42,632 --> 00:22:43,412
[SPEAKER_03]: The night before, I think.

327
00:22:43,472 --> 00:22:43,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

328
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:44,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It was funny.

329
00:22:44,893 --> 00:22:47,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was funny because you were so horrible at lying to him.

330
00:22:47,594 --> 00:22:48,334
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way.

331
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:56,435
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as you walked in, you said, Wow, I heard this awesome reading, but if you could see the look on his face, like, Oh, I know what he did.

332
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,356
[SPEAKER_02]: He found the MP3 game.

333
00:22:58,716 --> 00:23:00,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's exactly what he said ten minutes ago.

334
00:23:00,956 --> 00:23:01,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

335
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:02,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

336
00:23:02,576 --> 00:23:03,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, see?

337
00:23:03,597 --> 00:23:05,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Good minds think, or great minds think alike, whatever.

338
00:23:06,377 --> 00:23:08,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello also to the Rice Princess.

339
00:23:08,978 --> 00:23:09,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

340
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:10,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, how are you?

341
00:23:11,635 --> 00:23:12,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Crush tonight?

342
00:23:12,696 --> 00:23:12,876
Yep.

343
00:23:13,076 --> 00:23:13,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

344
00:23:13,577 --> 00:23:14,938
[SPEAKER_06]: For you and Jamie especially.

345
00:23:15,718 --> 00:23:18,840
[SPEAKER_02]: So she's tailor-made this one for me and Jamie apparently.

346
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

347
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:20,281
[SPEAKER_02]: This should be good.

348
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:21,502
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a kick in the ass.

349
00:23:21,602 --> 00:23:22,523
[SPEAKER_02]: This should be very good.

350
00:23:23,103 --> 00:23:24,224
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have that to look forward to.

351
00:23:25,485 --> 00:23:26,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned.

352
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:27,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

353
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,529
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Jamie, did you have anything else you wanted to say about your week?

354
00:23:31,569 --> 00:23:33,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of cut you off with my whole blooper story.

355
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:34,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

356
00:23:34,691 --> 00:23:34,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

357
00:23:35,011 --> 00:23:35,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a bad man.

358
00:23:36,973 --> 00:23:37,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

359
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:38,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Here now?

360
00:23:39,094 --> 00:23:39,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Show?

361
00:23:39,855 --> 00:23:39,995
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

362
00:23:40,015 --> 00:23:40,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

363
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:40,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

364
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:42,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a cookie.

365
00:23:42,126 --> 00:23:43,447
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a cookie, alright.

366
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:44,868
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my week?

367
00:23:45,368 --> 00:23:45,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

368
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:52,434
[SPEAKER_05]: My week was my last week of indulgence before I'm a good girl.

369
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:55,056
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to be on diet?

370
00:23:55,877 --> 00:23:57,938
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a diet, it's a lifestyle modification.

371
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,000
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lifestyle modification, amen.

372
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:05,504
[SPEAKER_05]: I am cutting down to one, because I found out that working where I do, I cannot give up soda completely.

373
00:24:06,185 --> 00:24:07,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I need caffeine and I need sugar.

374
00:24:08,987 --> 00:24:10,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm cutting to one soda a day and it's balls.

375
00:24:12,364 --> 00:24:13,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I drink balls at work.

376
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,506
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to drink soda, why not drink the worst one for you?

377
00:24:16,526 --> 00:24:18,226
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'll drink one with the worst caffeine.

378
00:24:19,847 --> 00:24:21,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Jolt would be worse than balls, probably.

379
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:24,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Much worse.

380
00:24:24,469 --> 00:24:31,152
[SPEAKER_05]: I am exchanging all of my cookies and fun sweet stuff for carrots and broccoli.

381
00:24:32,692 --> 00:24:33,133
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

382
00:24:33,953 --> 00:24:35,714
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to not eat chocolate that much.

383
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:36,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have carob.

384
00:24:37,854 --> 00:24:39,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew, carob makes you poo.

385
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:41,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything makes me poo, Rob.

386
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:45,011
[SPEAKER_05]: With my really crappy digestion, I will eat what I can get.

387
00:24:46,372 --> 00:24:47,753
[SPEAKER_03]: This show makes me poo.

388
00:24:49,434 --> 00:24:51,056
[SPEAKER_05]: It obviously makes Rob poo because you're in the bathroom.

389
00:24:51,076 --> 00:24:51,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there you are.

390
00:24:52,397 --> 00:24:53,718
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I ran to turn on the AC.

391
00:24:53,738 --> 00:24:57,401
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because... No, not applesauce.

392
00:24:57,441 --> 00:24:59,603
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's because Brad and Irene entered the room and it just got too hot in here.

393
00:25:00,104 --> 00:25:00,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

394
00:25:01,285 --> 00:25:02,746
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting hot in here.

395
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:04,508
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something rotten here.

396
00:25:05,408 --> 00:25:06,950
[SPEAKER_02]: You better hold your nose.

397
00:25:09,013 --> 00:25:11,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, by the way, I haven't whored out the chat room yet tonight, so I probably should.

398
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:15,877
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're listening and you want to join in the fun in our chat room, because there's a whole clusterfuck of people there tonight.

399
00:25:15,937 --> 00:25:16,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, chat room.

400
00:25:18,338 --> 00:25:19,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, fuster cluck.

[SPEAKER_02]: Go to www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on chat.

402
00:25:25,162 --> 00:25:26,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget about our LiveJournal community, too.

403
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:28,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, our LiveJournal community.

[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we need people to post.

407
00:25:36,644 --> 00:25:41,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, you need to assign people a topic for this week to post about in Orange Lounge.

408
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:42,387
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like an essay.

409
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:44,067
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be an essay project.

410
00:25:44,528 --> 00:25:45,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Best Bomani song to fuck to.

411
00:25:46,348 --> 00:25:47,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Best Bomani song to fuck to.

412
00:25:47,969 --> 00:25:51,731
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to know, in the Orange Lounge Live Journal community, the best Bomani song to fuck to.

413
00:25:53,412 --> 00:25:54,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Diamond Jealousy.

414
00:25:57,354 --> 00:25:57,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

415
00:25:59,234 --> 00:25:59,615
[SPEAKER_15]: Holick.

416
00:25:59,815 --> 00:26:00,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, hell.

417
00:26:03,547 --> 00:26:04,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw the worst porn ever two weeks ago.

418
00:26:04,768 --> 00:26:04,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

419
00:26:20,854 --> 00:26:23,695
[SPEAKER_05]: It was something that, um, that, uh, Jabberwocky had.

420
00:26:24,056 --> 00:26:24,456
[SPEAKER_26]: What's that?

421
00:26:24,536 --> 00:26:27,837
[SPEAKER_05]: We were watching our movie night, and, like, I had to leave before the anime actually started.

422
00:26:28,117 --> 00:26:28,618
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh-huh.

423
00:26:28,638 --> 00:26:32,440
[SPEAKER_05]: There was some, like, really rotten, horrible, like, camcorder porn.

424
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,980
[SPEAKER_05]: And this woman had a wart.

425
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,683
[SPEAKER_05]: It was straight, like, trailer trash hooker or something.

426
00:26:39,283 --> 00:26:40,183
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so bad.

427
00:26:40,203 --> 00:26:45,886
[SPEAKER_05]: And we, like, they showed this, like, shot of, of her area.

428
00:26:46,466 --> 00:26:47,767
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a big ol' wart.

429
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:48,847
I was like, eww.

430
00:26:50,668 --> 00:26:51,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it have a name?

431
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:53,410
[SPEAKER_03]: The wart?

432
00:26:54,131 --> 00:26:54,751
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the wart.

433
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:55,692
[SPEAKER_03]: The wart had a name.

434
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:57,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubba.

435
00:26:58,154 --> 00:27:05,379
[SPEAKER_02]: FYI, our ever-faithful Black Lab, our correspondent for the People's Republic of Kansas, Ben, and I'll hope you enter here.

436
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:05,960
[SPEAKER_02]: TM.

437
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

438
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:06,480
[SPEAKER_02]: TM.

439
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Trademark.

440
00:27:09,102 --> 00:27:09,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Trademark.

441
00:27:09,743 --> 00:27:10,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

442
00:27:10,643 --> 00:27:15,287
[SPEAKER_02]: He is posting that in the community right now so that it will not be forgotten.

443
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:23,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, while we were talking about porn and Bomani, I thought this would be a good chance for me to ask Loki about his week.

444
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:25,384
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, God.

445
00:27:25,964 --> 00:27:26,745
[SPEAKER_02]: What about my week?

446
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:29,006
[SPEAKER_20]: It was pretty boring.

447
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:31,967
[SPEAKER_20]: My girlfriend had her 21st birthday.

448
00:27:32,488 --> 00:27:33,348
[SPEAKER_13]: Happy birthday!

449
00:27:33,888 --> 00:27:37,070
[SPEAKER_20]: She was 21 on Wednesday, so she's happy.

450
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:44,294
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, she could have been happier because also for her birthday she got strep throat, so that kind of sucks.

451
00:27:44,727 --> 00:27:46,968
[SPEAKER_19]: She's still sick, so, yeah.

452
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:50,010
[SPEAKER_21]: So I guess you guys didn't go dancing or some club or something.

453
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,952
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, like we never do that anyways.

454
00:27:52,372 --> 00:27:54,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Go drinking, go to a porn strip club.

455
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:55,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait, that's 18.

456
00:27:56,234 --> 00:27:58,576
[SPEAKER_19]: She can't drink anyways because of her disease.

457
00:27:58,956 --> 00:27:59,696
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah, I'm sorry.

458
00:27:59,997 --> 00:28:00,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Anywho.

459
00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:01,398
[SPEAKER_19]: That's no good.

460
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:05,260
[SPEAKER_28]: But no, we just hung out and stuff and that's all.

461
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,363
[SPEAKER_28]: But yeah, I'm sure the thing Rob is wanting me to talk about.

462
00:28:10,383 --> 00:28:11,524
[SPEAKER_23]: Tell us, Loki, tell us.

463
00:28:12,595 --> 00:28:20,320
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe last week we mentioned that I was going to be getting a certain video coming in over eBay.

464
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming in.

465
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:26,843
[SPEAKER_20]: And this video that I have received, and it's funny because we only missed it by one day, too.

466
00:28:28,404 --> 00:28:31,006
[SPEAKER_28]: This video is called Dance Dance Fuck.

467
00:28:32,106 --> 00:28:33,007
[SPEAKER_28]: D.D.F.

468
00:28:33,947 --> 00:28:34,848
[SPEAKER_28]: Eat me raw.

469
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:36,449
[SPEAKER_02]: It was supposed to be...

470
00:28:38,977 --> 00:28:40,038
[SPEAKER_20]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

471
00:29:06,806 --> 00:29:09,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's DDF 6 Mix, by the way.

472
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:12,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there a 1.5?

473
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:12,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

474
00:29:13,011 --> 00:29:15,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that the Chicks with Dicks episode?

475
00:29:15,894 --> 00:29:18,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea, but we're going to hear a little bit here of DDF.

476
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys want to see?

477
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:25,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry, it's children's safe because it's mosaics, like all Japanese porn.

478
00:29:28,865 --> 00:29:29,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Rated R porn.

479
00:29:30,026 --> 00:29:32,748
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like porn that would be on VH1 if they ever had porn.

480
00:29:33,088 --> 00:29:33,609
[SPEAKER_02]: And they wouldn't.

481
00:29:34,392 --> 00:29:36,153
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Showgirls with the drawn-on bikinis.

482
00:29:36,213 --> 00:29:37,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here it is, the intro screen.

483
00:29:40,136 --> 00:29:41,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the sound should be going through.

484
00:29:41,597 --> 00:29:42,978
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going through the little intros right now.

485
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:43,918
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like DNA.

486
00:29:44,939 --> 00:29:45,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, or not.

487
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:50,022
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from Deep 5 Studios, it looks like.

488
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:50,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that Deep's?

489
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:51,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.

490
00:29:51,703 --> 00:29:52,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance, dance, fuck!

491
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:03,711
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the star, Wakabayashi Habayashi or something.

492
00:30:04,662 --> 00:30:07,165
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's the biggest pair of camel lips I've ever seen.

493
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:10,690
[SPEAKER_02]: And there they go.

494
00:30:11,191 --> 00:30:18,280
[SPEAKER_02]: To describe the scene for you guys, it's just some chick in a nightclub wearing a bunch of silver.

495
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,521
[SPEAKER_02]: And rubbing herself.

496
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:21,223
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's rubbing and feeling herself.

497
00:30:21,824 --> 00:30:22,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she's just kind of...

498
00:30:25,297 --> 00:30:26,517
[SPEAKER_02]: And this has nothing to do with DDR.

499
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:29,938
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not dancing on a DDR pad or anything, it's just... Oh, head.

500
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:35,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Occasionally on the screen it will flash, DD, DD, Dance Dance Fox 6 Mix.

501
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:41,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Think back in the early 90s, except it's like, the grind in Japan, on MTV.

502
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,661
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I think, yeah, Jamie says with fucking, but I think if it was the grind in Japan, there would probably be fucking anyway.

503
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:49,201
[SPEAKER_21]: Right on there, on TV.

504
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:51,782
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, let's give it a head here.

505
00:30:52,362 --> 00:30:52,782
[SPEAKER_28]: Do-do-do-do.

506
00:30:53,914 --> 00:30:55,096
[SPEAKER_28]: It's definitely really any good.

507
00:30:56,077 --> 00:30:56,698
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not funny.

508
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, that's funny.

509
00:31:01,205 --> 00:31:03,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the cool thing about Dance Dance Fuck 6, Nick,

510
00:31:03,939 --> 00:31:04,359
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

511
00:31:28,656 --> 00:31:38,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely nothing to do with DDR at all, except for the fact that sometimes on the screen it'll flash the title, Dance Dance Fuck, and they're in a nightclub and they're dressed like nightclubs.

512
00:31:38,384 --> 00:31:40,206
[SPEAKER_02]: They're dressed like Kara chicks without the boots.

513
00:31:40,746 --> 00:31:42,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm gonna go sit over here now.

514
00:31:42,427 --> 00:31:43,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that sucks now.

515
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:45,149
[SPEAKER_05]: I want my socks.

516
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:47,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Camera 1.

517
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:50,354
[SPEAKER_05]: What, there's milky angles or something?

518
00:31:50,394 --> 00:31:51,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it just says Camera 1.

519
00:31:52,836 --> 00:31:54,017
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's dancing.

520
00:31:55,157 --> 00:31:56,819
[SPEAKER_05]: This music isn't any good, really.

521
00:31:59,053 --> 00:32:01,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Loki, what would you say about putting this in a sim?

522
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:05,356
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be hilarious.

523
00:32:06,296 --> 00:32:07,977
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, I should do that for a random video.

524
00:32:08,377 --> 00:32:09,758
[SPEAKER_28]: Can I still enter Tournament 4?

525
00:32:11,478 --> 00:32:11,819
[SPEAKER_28]: You have 4?

526
00:32:12,459 --> 00:32:13,139
[SPEAKER_28]: No, you can't.

527
00:32:13,739 --> 00:32:18,662
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, but I'll get to Tournament 4 later, because we've got news on that too, but... Yeah.

528
00:32:18,822 --> 00:32:20,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Where can I get the soundtrack for this?

529
00:32:21,343 --> 00:32:23,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's one song, so... It's pretty good.

530
00:32:24,204 --> 00:32:25,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh, we got another song.

531
00:32:29,249 --> 00:32:30,129
[SPEAKER_03]: This could be Tak.

532
00:32:30,309 --> 00:32:30,449
[SPEAKER_13]: No!

533
00:32:30,469 --> 00:32:33,970
[SPEAKER_13]: This sounds like I've got the rage on Sunday nights.

534
00:32:37,051 --> 00:32:43,913
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it's the same girl in the silver dress who's got like... She's like the slut of the nightclub.

535
00:32:46,734 --> 00:32:49,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn, I wish Tourney Mix 4 wasn't closed, because I would so envy this.

536
00:32:49,614 --> 00:32:50,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, she has her slutty friends with her.

537
00:32:50,955 --> 00:32:53,255
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd have this in the background, just a video, too.

538
00:32:54,256 --> 00:32:55,196
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always Tourney Mix 5.

539
00:32:57,205 --> 00:32:59,766
[SPEAKER_02]: coming soon to screen near you.

540
00:33:00,086 --> 00:33:00,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, yeah.

541
00:33:00,907 --> 00:33:02,067
[SPEAKER_02]: So, dance, dance, fuck.

542
00:33:02,507 --> 00:33:03,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of sucks.

543
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:06,649
[SPEAKER_05]: She's getting tongue now.

544
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,251
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not... Ew, that's not even slightly erotic.

545
00:33:11,872 --> 00:33:12,252
[SPEAKER_02]: At all.

546
00:33:12,892 --> 00:33:14,953
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks like something out of a sci... Oh, my God!

547
00:33:14,973 --> 00:33:15,433
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

548
00:33:15,733 --> 00:33:18,895
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a history... I mean, an animal planet or something, it looks like.

549
00:33:19,595 --> 00:33:20,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Discovery Channel.

550
00:33:21,856 --> 00:33:24,177
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like something out of a bad science fiction movie.

551
00:33:24,817 --> 00:33:26,238
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like something from Anti-Anime.

552
00:33:27,826 --> 00:33:30,028
[SPEAKER_28]: That guy does not know how to make out at all.

553
00:33:31,129 --> 00:33:32,190
[SPEAKER_28]: He's like, what am I doing here?

554
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,952
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't care.

555
00:33:34,032 --> 00:33:34,753
[SPEAKER_02]: He's riding me.

556
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:36,975
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

557
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:39,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we can turn off the bad porn now.

558
00:33:39,497 --> 00:33:39,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

559
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:42,060
[SPEAKER_05]: That was really awful.

560
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,161
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

561
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:45,102
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard it here first.

562
00:33:45,182 --> 00:33:47,324
[SPEAKER_05]: That's ten minutes of my life I'm never getting back.

563
00:33:47,364 --> 00:33:49,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance, fuck, six mix.

564
00:33:50,347 --> 00:33:50,667
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

565
00:33:51,648 --> 00:33:53,270
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that all you want to say about your week?

566
00:33:54,486 --> 00:33:55,206
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, yeah.

567
00:33:55,787 --> 00:33:58,648
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't do too much of them and make the remix.

568
00:33:59,968 --> 00:34:00,769
[SPEAKER_19]: What else did I do?

569
00:34:00,949 --> 00:34:01,329
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

570
00:34:01,429 --> 00:34:02,849
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't do really much of anything.

571
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:04,750
[SPEAKER_13]: Slap.

572
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:09,272
[SPEAKER_13]: That's tired.

573
00:34:09,592 --> 00:34:10,692
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, that's it.

574
00:34:12,913 --> 00:34:13,273
[SPEAKER_28]: Wow.

575
00:34:14,034 --> 00:34:14,394
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

576
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,595
[SPEAKER_28]: Still trying to get the phones working.

577
00:34:18,235 --> 00:34:18,856
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I don't know.

578
00:34:20,236 --> 00:34:20,996
[SPEAKER_28]: Find it eventually.

579
00:34:23,347 --> 00:34:24,308
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

580
00:34:40,373 --> 00:34:45,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Suddenly Susan's been off the air for a couple years.

581
00:34:45,936 --> 00:34:47,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, I don't watch TV, okay?

582
00:34:47,777 --> 00:34:48,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

583
00:34:48,197 --> 00:34:49,417
[SPEAKER_05]: But he looks dorky now.

584
00:34:49,898 --> 00:34:53,679
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, he's still, you know, cute, but with his haircut he looks really dorky.

585
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Not when he was young and hot.

586
00:34:57,581 --> 00:34:58,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Breakfast Club's cool, though.

587
00:34:59,302 --> 00:35:02,664
[SPEAKER_05]: He looks dorky in a not cool way.

588
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:05,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Not like Elijah Wood, you know, he's dorky in a cool way, right?

589
00:35:05,725 --> 00:35:09,027
[SPEAKER_02]: LankyStyle, since you ruthlessly took the mic away from Jamie, you want to tell us about your week?

590
00:35:09,713 --> 00:35:10,233
[SPEAKER_02]: My week?

591
00:35:10,474 --> 00:35:11,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it was a week.

592
00:35:11,895 --> 00:35:12,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Haha.

593
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:16,398
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just the same old me, you know, unemployed, playing Rhinerox.

594
00:35:17,258 --> 00:35:22,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, let me think if anything special happened besides the, you know, thing you found out about today.

595
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:24,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... Tell us about it.

596
00:35:24,643 --> 00:35:25,324
[SPEAKER_03]: You want me to tell you about it?

597
00:35:25,344 --> 00:35:25,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

00:35:59,332 --> 00:36:03,996
[SPEAKER_02]: How the game looks to people, if people listening want to hear, you know, might be interested in getting it.

602
00:36:04,216 --> 00:36:04,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd be curious.

603
00:36:05,737 --> 00:36:08,419
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, but I don't know when it's going to get here, so I'll let everybody know.

00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:11,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Jamie, and did you and your fiancé both apply?

[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie played for the PS2 beta, and I played for the Windows beta.

[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.

00:36:22,751 --> 00:36:24,532
[SPEAKER_29]: Does anybody else we know sign up to beta test?

00:36:24,552 --> 00:36:28,075
[SPEAKER_29]: I've never seen Ragnarok.

611
00:36:28,456 --> 00:36:28,936
Beautiful.

612
00:36:30,211 --> 00:36:35,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Irene's saying that she's never going to see me again because I've got Riding Rock and Final Fantasy XI.

613
00:36:36,075 --> 00:36:36,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about that.

614
00:36:36,656 --> 00:36:38,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they have a launch date for Final Fantasy XI on computer yet?

615
00:36:39,278 --> 00:36:40,518
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't know.

616
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:45,982
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be, I just haven't been looking into it because I'm just like, hey, I'm a beta tester, so I get to play it before everybody else.

617
00:36:46,463 --> 00:36:46,763
[SPEAKER_13]: Woo!

618
00:36:47,063 --> 00:36:47,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not everybody else.

619
00:36:49,945 --> 00:36:52,427
[SPEAKER_03]: But anywho, I don't know anybody else who is.

620
00:36:52,487 --> 00:36:54,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think it's just me, Jamie, and Dan.

621
00:36:55,409 --> 00:36:56,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that'd be fun.

622
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck to you guys.

623
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,651
[SPEAKER_03]: You should apply.

624
00:36:58,231 --> 00:36:59,192
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably too late now, isn't it?

625
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:03,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in the emails it's something about July is when the public beta starts.

626
00:37:04,272 --> 00:37:06,272
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like less than a month of closed beta.

627
00:37:06,352 --> 00:37:06,992
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting.

628
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:08,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is kind of weird.

629
00:37:08,533 --> 00:37:10,633
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, you could at least play the public beta in July.

630
00:37:11,413 --> 00:37:11,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, whatever.

631
00:37:11,973 --> 00:37:13,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you don't care.

632
00:37:13,094 --> 00:37:14,054
[SPEAKER_03]: You're too popular.

633
00:37:14,074 --> 00:37:16,434
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm excited about Final Fantasy XI.

634
00:37:16,454 --> 00:37:18,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of wish it was on GameCube because I don't know why.

635
00:37:18,735 --> 00:37:21,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love my GameCube and I want everything to be on it.

636
00:37:21,555 --> 00:37:22,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to hell.

637
00:37:22,975 --> 00:37:23,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm already there.

638
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, do you talk about GameCube?

639
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:26,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

640
00:37:26,914 --> 00:37:27,974
[SPEAKER_02]: My computer, you know what?

641
00:37:28,074 --> 00:37:29,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't play games on my computer.

642
00:37:29,855 --> 00:37:35,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, even when I seem to have a top-of-the-line system, games suck to play on my computer.

643
00:37:35,395 --> 00:37:35,976
[SPEAKER_02]: They really do.

644
00:37:36,476 --> 00:37:39,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I can help you out there, but... I know.

645
00:37:39,256 --> 00:37:40,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

646
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:43,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week, by the way, I'm bringing over Slow Caliber 2.

647
00:37:44,677 --> 00:37:45,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah?

648
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:45,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

649
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:46,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had it for, like, a month.

650
00:37:46,777 --> 00:37:48,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the demo at Fry's this week.

651
00:37:49,158 --> 00:37:51,078
[SPEAKER_05]: The demo doesn't do the game justice.

652
00:37:51,158 --> 00:37:52,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I have GameCube, of course.

653
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:54,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess... Yeah, we'll link.

654
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:56,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'll talk about my week.

655
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:56,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

656
00:37:56,761 --> 00:38:03,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Navi and I decided to go to Fry's on Monday because I wanted to make a random purchase, so I decided I wanted to buy a GameCube game.

657
00:38:04,287 --> 00:38:10,131
[SPEAKER_02]: And it came down to two games, like we were looking, and we were either going to get Mario Party 4 or Cubivore.

658
00:38:11,112 --> 00:38:17,717
[SPEAKER_02]: And I decided to get Mario Party 4 because I like to be popular, and when I get Mario Party 4, people will come over more and want to play, so I bought it.

659
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:20,159
[SPEAKER_02]: And that worked for Friday.

660
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,502
[SPEAKER_02]: But Cubivore, actually what happened is...

661
00:38:24,742 --> 00:38:30,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Navi was so obsessed with Cubivore and the idea of it, he went and freaking bought it.

662
00:38:30,664 --> 00:38:33,885
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually pretty cool, because you get to eat things.

663
00:38:34,766 --> 00:38:38,587
[SPEAKER_02]: You ruthlessly tear the tails off of little cube snakes and stuff.

664
00:38:38,767 --> 00:38:49,311
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like a mix between Faceball 2000, except everything's cubes and 3D, and EVO, that old SNES game, where you kind of evolve, you eat things, you get experience points, then you can evolve.

665
00:38:50,305 --> 00:38:52,327
[SPEAKER_03]: But everything's still cubes, so it's kind of weird.

666
00:38:52,527 --> 00:38:53,627
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's very interesting.

667
00:38:53,687 --> 00:38:59,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I especially love the screen where you have to go mate, because you have to mate to have offspring to get more limbs, I guess.

668
00:38:59,432 --> 00:39:00,633
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's kind of complicated.

669
00:39:00,673 --> 00:39:01,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not really.

670
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:05,276
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's funny, because it says, like, you attracted five females.

671
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:06,977
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it says, would you like to mate?

672
00:39:07,037 --> 00:39:07,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes or no?

673
00:39:08,218 --> 00:39:12,561
[SPEAKER_02]: The mating scene in Cube of War is, like, the best thing I've seen in any video game in the past year.

674
00:39:12,661 --> 00:39:14,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like to mate?

675
00:39:14,543 --> 00:39:15,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes or no?

676
00:39:15,383 --> 00:39:17,285
[SPEAKER_03]: If a guy's playing the game, who's going to answer no?

677
00:39:18,642 --> 00:39:20,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are some pretty hot cube chicks.

678
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, whoa.

679
00:39:21,643 --> 00:39:25,024
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at the end he says, I mated with five females.

680
00:39:26,524 --> 00:39:27,585
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had three kids.

681
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:29,205
[SPEAKER_21]: Or three of the females had kids.

682
00:39:29,225 --> 00:39:30,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like an episode of Jerry Springer.

683
00:39:32,006 --> 00:39:33,587
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, Cube Springer, Jerry Springer.

684
00:39:35,427 --> 00:39:36,748
[SPEAKER_02]: So Rice Princess, how was your week?

685
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry.

686
00:39:39,688 --> 00:39:40,569
[SPEAKER_06]: It was as good as always.

687
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I started a diet on Monday, but that's about it.

688
00:39:43,129 --> 00:39:43,830
[SPEAKER_06]: How's your diet going?

689
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:44,790
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been going pretty good.

690
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:46,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I lost like five pounds.

691
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:46,891
[SPEAKER_13]: Woohoo!

692
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:47,651
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations.

693
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:47,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll stop.

694
00:39:55,433 --> 00:39:58,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I need to go on a lifestyle change.

695
00:39:58,554 --> 00:40:02,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's not a real diet, so to speak, it's a lifestyle change.

696
00:40:04,656 --> 00:40:05,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that's good.

697
00:40:07,377 --> 00:40:08,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and that's about it.

698
00:40:09,538 --> 00:40:10,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Boring old me.

699
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:14,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so anybody else have anything they want to say here during the first little bit of show?

700
00:40:14,909 --> 00:40:18,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually been going on a while now, but anybody else have something they want to add to the conversation going on right now?

701
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:21,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'm cool.

702
00:40:21,472 --> 00:40:23,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Jamie.

703
00:40:23,392 --> 00:40:24,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone wants to be like me.

704
00:40:25,393 --> 00:40:27,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, sure, Jamie.

705
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:27,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

706
00:40:28,414 --> 00:40:31,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

707
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:38,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I think we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to start this break off with a song.

708
00:40:38,198 --> 00:40:38,498
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

709
00:40:38,858 --> 00:40:39,078
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

710
00:40:41,198 --> 00:40:41,418
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

711
00:40:41,478 --> 00:40:41,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't hear.

712
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:42,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Blah, blah, blah.

713
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Freaks.

714
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Freaks.

715
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:47,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I wanted to play one more song real fast, and we'll get into some Guitar Freaks stuff.

716
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:54,330
[SPEAKER_02]: But since this is graduation week for a lot of people, and they're graduating high school and college, I thought I'd play graduation.

717
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that cute?

718
00:40:55,551 --> 00:40:59,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go drill out my ears with an electric drill now.

719
00:40:59,335 --> 00:41:00,256
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll sound better.

720
00:41:00,596 --> 00:41:02,818
[SPEAKER_02]: This is dedicated to the class of 2003.

721
00:41:03,479 --> 00:41:06,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, since we're all ranty, I suppose we should do the FUs of the week next.

722
00:41:07,438 --> 00:41:11,539
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't you go ahead and send those to me over a private message in the chat room.

723
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:12,319
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Sky.

724
00:41:12,899 --> 00:41:15,500
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you aren't in our chat room, get your ass over there.

725
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,780
[SPEAKER_02]: www.callybomondi.com, click on Orange Lounge, click on Chat.

726
00:41:20,801 --> 00:41:21,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes?

727
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:22,121
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

728
00:41:22,501 --> 00:41:22,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

729
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:26,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so, congratulations, and then a couple Guitar Freak songs.

730
00:41:26,502 --> 00:41:28,242
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this is to you, Class of 2003.

731
00:41:28,462 --> 00:41:33,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't invest our job market.

732
00:43:40,995 --> 00:43:41,981
Thanks for watching!

733
00:44:49,492 --> 00:44:52,073
Thank you for watching!

734
00:45:12,285 --> 00:45:16,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Watch them disappear without love Where would you be now without love?

735
00:45:16,386 --> 00:45:22,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Illinois is such a seven-centi-feet That I keep on pushin' mama, you know they're runnin' late

736
00:45:41,926 --> 00:45:43,667
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching.

737
00:46:27,415 --> 00:46:33,942
Thank you for watching!

738
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:22,023
[SPEAKER_27]: Orange Lounge Radio is proud to present a celebrity interview.

739
00:48:22,863 --> 00:48:24,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you introduce yourself for our listeners?

740
00:48:24,965 --> 00:48:25,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Miss Cleo.

741
00:48:26,346 --> 00:48:27,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's great to have you on the show today.

742
00:48:28,267 --> 00:48:29,408
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, how are you today?

743
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:30,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm great, thanks.

744
00:48:31,029 --> 00:48:32,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you have a question?

745
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:38,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, yes, actually I wanted to know... Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please?

746
00:48:39,494 --> 00:48:44,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, well, no, I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.

747
00:48:44,337 --> 00:48:45,198
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, go ahead.

748
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:48,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?

749
00:48:49,084 --> 00:48:50,004
[SPEAKER_12]: Is he incarcerated?

750
00:48:50,644 --> 00:48:51,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, actually, no, he's not.

751
00:48:52,005 --> 00:48:54,245
[SPEAKER_02]: But what do you think of the ever-ranty DarkSakura?

752
00:48:54,405 --> 00:48:55,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, dear, how are you?

753
00:48:56,246 --> 00:48:56,986
[SPEAKER_12]: I love you.

754
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:58,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I see you two must know each other.

755
00:48:58,826 --> 00:49:00,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what do you think of Sky?

756
00:49:00,427 --> 00:49:02,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Did he used to play football when he was in high school?

757
00:49:02,587 --> 00:49:04,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, no, he didn't.

758
00:49:05,248 --> 00:49:07,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?

759
00:49:07,549 --> 00:49:09,069
[SPEAKER_12]: I want you to really remember...

760
00:49:10,144 --> 00:49:13,366
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly.

761
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:16,608
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.

762
00:49:17,348 --> 00:49:17,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

763
00:49:18,048 --> 00:49:20,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.

764
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:26,153
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but who are all of these nosy people?

765
00:49:26,393 --> 00:49:29,714
[SPEAKER_12]: Outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card.

766
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:30,815
[SPEAKER_27]: Get away from me.

767
00:49:33,336 --> 00:49:38,099
[SPEAKER_27]: Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.

768
00:49:38,622 --> 00:49:39,442
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Miss Cleo.

769
00:49:39,802 --> 00:49:40,543
[SPEAKER_12]: I love you.

770
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:43,203
[SPEAKER_02]: We are back.

771
00:49:43,683 --> 00:49:45,944
[SPEAKER_02]: You're listening to episode number 47, not 48.

772
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:47,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

773
00:49:48,744 --> 00:49:49,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Ha ha.

774
00:49:49,905 --> 00:49:50,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Ha ha ha.

775
00:49:51,245 --> 00:49:53,006
[SPEAKER_02]: We hope you enjoy our cheesy little promos.

776
00:49:54,046 --> 00:49:57,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Jamie threatened in her live journal today to make some new ones this week.

777
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:57,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited.

778
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:58,827
[SPEAKER_13]: I did?

779
00:49:58,847 --> 00:50:00,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you said you wanted to make new promos.

780
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:00,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that's right, I did.

781
00:50:02,108 --> 00:50:03,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, go for it, dude.

782
00:50:04,008 --> 00:50:04,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Dudette.

783
00:50:04,688 --> 00:50:04,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Who?

784
00:50:05,889 --> 00:50:06,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie.

785
00:50:06,209 --> 00:50:06,569
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, her?

786
00:50:06,689 --> 00:50:07,029
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

787
00:50:07,778 --> 00:50:09,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make a couple more celebrity interviews, too.

788
00:50:09,499 --> 00:50:11,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to call some people and get more celebrity interviews.

789
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that was fun, interviewing Miss Cleo.

790
00:50:14,341 --> 00:50:15,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to try to get some wrestlers.

791
00:50:16,162 --> 00:50:19,023
[SPEAKER_05]: She's... Hey!

792
00:50:20,144 --> 00:50:20,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah!

793
00:50:21,945 --> 00:50:23,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Brad does a really good impression.

794
00:50:23,285 --> 00:50:24,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I am very sad.

795
00:50:24,586 --> 00:50:24,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

796
00:50:24,886 --> 00:50:25,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss Elizabeth is dead.

797
00:50:26,907 --> 00:50:27,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's Miss Elizabeth?

798
00:50:28,668 --> 00:50:31,409
[SPEAKER_05]: She was Macho Man's wife, like, in the 80s.

799
00:50:31,869 --> 00:50:33,110
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't follow wrestling.

800
00:50:38,662 --> 00:50:38,902
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

801
00:50:39,142 --> 00:50:39,383
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

802
00:50:40,063 --> 00:50:42,084
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing wrestling drama.

803
00:50:42,104 --> 00:50:42,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, alright.

804
00:50:42,825 --> 00:50:43,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

805
00:50:43,145 --> 00:50:43,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

806
00:50:45,146 --> 00:50:46,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Shall we get to the FUs of the week?

807
00:50:47,187 --> 00:50:47,567
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

808
00:50:48,008 --> 00:50:49,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want the new song?

809
00:50:49,568 --> 00:50:50,329
[SPEAKER_02]: You want the new one.

810
00:50:50,629 --> 00:50:51,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

811
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:52,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

812
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:55,572
[SPEAKER_02]: It is now FU of the week time.

813
00:50:56,112 --> 00:50:58,634
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is this FU of the week thing all about, Jamie?

814
00:50:59,234 --> 00:51:00,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Where we get pissed off and tell you about it.

815
00:51:17,985 --> 00:51:21,387
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one goes toward the stupid bitch that was in front of me driving.

816
00:51:22,528 --> 00:51:28,952
[SPEAKER_05]: She was obviously drunk, and she would... True to the law says you have to stop a full car like behind the person in front of you at a stoplight.

817
00:51:29,412 --> 00:51:30,553
[SPEAKER_05]: But who follows that anyway?

818
00:51:30,593 --> 00:51:31,073
[SPEAKER_05]: That's stupid.

819
00:51:31,594 --> 00:51:36,096
[SPEAKER_05]: And she was stopping, and then she was like driving all twitchy, so I just had to speed around her.

820
00:51:36,116 --> 00:51:36,717
[SPEAKER_05]: She's so stupid.

821
00:51:37,225 --> 00:51:43,467
[SPEAKER_05]: And then her question in the seat next to her was obviously on E. She kept putting her hands in the air and then trying to hug the girl in the front seat.

822
00:51:44,967 --> 00:51:48,368
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, uh, fuck having SARS.

823
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:51,909
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole beginning of this week I was so sick of my allergies.

824
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:57,171
[SPEAKER_05]: And thanks to, uh, free gifts from Allegra and Claritin D, I was all better.

825
00:51:57,931 --> 00:51:58,731
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it sucks.

826
00:51:59,151 --> 00:52:01,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have a voice, but I work in friggin' customer service, so what's up?

827
00:52:02,932 --> 00:52:04,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then...

828
00:52:06,983 --> 00:52:09,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Another one goes to not having, you know, money and stuff.

829
00:52:10,524 --> 00:52:12,124
[SPEAKER_05]: And my breaks, which grind.

830
00:52:13,565 --> 00:52:16,545
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, I think that's about it.

831
00:52:17,286 --> 00:52:20,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really all that angsty that much anymore because my life is sort of happy right now.

832
00:52:21,827 --> 00:52:22,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, that's so cute.

833
00:52:23,727 --> 00:52:24,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Break my ass.

834
00:52:24,627 --> 00:52:25,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you.

835
00:52:26,788 --> 00:52:27,808
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I can get you, Rani.

836
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:29,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that, that.

837
00:52:29,809 --> 00:52:31,329
[SPEAKER_05]: And another one goes to Rob.

838
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:32,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

839
00:52:33,169 --> 00:52:34,730
[SPEAKER_05]: And another one goes toward, um,

840
00:52:35,976 --> 00:52:38,918
[SPEAKER_05]: All of these communities I'm a member of, just about, in my live journal.

841
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm, like, taking them, I'm taking them all off, because people just post really stupid stuff.

842
00:52:44,122 --> 00:52:51,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm leaving up the DDR and Baymani communities, but, like, you know, it's just been, like, some stupid drama going on.

843
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:53,129
[SPEAKER_05]: And this other guy, okay, okay, okay.

844
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:54,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's one.

845
00:52:55,151 --> 00:53:01,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, everyone knows about, you know, I go through my fans, you know, crazes and my little phases, and right now it's Transformers for me.

846
00:53:02,757 --> 00:53:02,937
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

847
00:53:06,503 --> 00:53:07,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay!

848
00:53:08,124 --> 00:53:08,985
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

849
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:12,728
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm on this roleplay board.

850
00:53:13,308 --> 00:53:15,770
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's this guy being... You're on the microphone cord.

851
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:19,033
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy's just being all godmode-y.

852
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:21,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate godmode RPG players.

853
00:53:22,135 --> 00:53:23,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate it.

854
00:53:23,956 --> 00:53:29,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially when you're not doing anything with a set combat-based rule, and he's like, oh, I just had me appear there, and you're blah blah blah.

855
00:53:29,901 --> 00:53:32,122
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, okay, and where in your profile is this?

856
00:53:32,202 --> 00:53:35,145
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he was like, well, you've been here a month ago, you would've known blah blah blah.

857
00:53:35,165 --> 00:53:35,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, okay.

858
00:53:36,385 --> 00:53:46,710
[SPEAKER_05]: So he got smacked down by one of the admins on the board, so that made me feel all happy and justified and I couldn't help rubbing his nose in it, so... Did he have an ogre-slaying knife?

859
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:47,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's why.

860
00:53:48,111 --> 00:53:51,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I got an ogre-slaying knife as a plus nine against ogres!

861
00:53:52,253 --> 00:53:54,434
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not even there, you're getting drunk!

862
00:53:55,254 --> 00:53:55,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, no.

863
00:53:56,915 --> 00:53:58,056
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it wasn't that.

864
00:53:58,276 --> 00:53:59,476
[SPEAKER_05]: He was just being stupid.

865
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:05,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I really, really... And another thing, people who have their live journals...

866
00:54:06,013 --> 00:54:08,914
[SPEAKER_05]: and cannot use paragraphs or complete sentences.

867
00:54:09,534 --> 00:54:12,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you're doing it on purpose, and if that's the case, stop.

868
00:54:14,095 --> 00:54:14,435
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

869
00:54:14,995 --> 00:54:21,497
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of these people are really, you know, nice people.

870
00:54:21,517 --> 00:54:22,417
[SPEAKER_25]: That's going out over here.

871
00:54:23,098 --> 00:54:24,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Great people that I know.

872
00:54:24,918 --> 00:54:25,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you to death.

873
00:54:26,078 --> 00:54:32,400
[SPEAKER_05]: But please, use grammatically correct sentence structure when you post in your live journal.

874
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,221
[SPEAKER_05]: And also for people who put humongous posts,

875
00:54:35,962 --> 00:54:36,902
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I understand.

876
00:54:36,922 --> 00:54:37,482
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

877
00:54:37,603 --> 00:54:38,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I do it too.

878
00:54:38,863 --> 00:54:40,864
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's such a feature called LJ Cut.

879
00:54:41,004 --> 00:54:42,344
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really easy code to remember.

880
00:54:42,624 --> 00:54:45,285
[SPEAKER_05]: You can even go onto the FAQ page and cut and paste.

881
00:54:46,125 --> 00:54:46,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow!

882
00:54:47,165 --> 00:54:47,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it!

883
00:54:48,766 --> 00:54:49,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm done.

884
00:54:51,047 --> 00:54:51,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

885
00:54:51,787 --> 00:54:52,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I could name names, but I won't.

886
00:54:52,947 --> 00:54:53,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just tell them to their face later.

887
00:54:54,608 --> 00:54:54,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

888
00:54:56,928 --> 00:54:58,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry for messing with the phone.

889
00:54:59,491 --> 00:55:01,013
[SPEAKER_28]: I forgot to connect this to the soundboard.

890
00:55:01,033 --> 00:55:03,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we want to hear your conversation that you're going to have.

891
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:06,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to, because I fixed something.

892
00:55:06,138 --> 00:55:07,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I was seeing if it worked.

893
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:12,504
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was calling my voicemail to see if it would leave a message, because if it left a message, that meant the phones were working.

894
00:55:12,664 --> 00:55:14,406
[SPEAKER_21]: So Matt's first fuck you goes to Brad.

895
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:18,049
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I'm not that mad this week, actually.

896
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:20,572
[SPEAKER_28]: First, slight...

897
00:55:21,314 --> 00:55:21,794
[SPEAKER_28]: First F.U.

898
00:55:21,814 --> 00:55:22,854
[SPEAKER_28]: of the Week, not really an F.U.

899
00:55:22,914 --> 00:55:26,295
[SPEAKER_28]: of the Week, kind of like I'm laughing at you because you're stupid, type of thing.

900
00:55:27,195 --> 00:55:36,918
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm gonna laugh at the stupid bitch that I mentioned last week, cause, hi, you're licensed, you have to take a picture, you have to take the stupid veil off, you stupid bastard.

901
00:55:37,398 --> 00:55:40,058
[SPEAKER_28]: Go home, go back to your country, you freaking Al-Qaeda.

902
00:55:40,459 --> 00:55:41,639
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways, enough.

903
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:45,040
[SPEAKER_28]: So, um, enough of that, and, um, let's see, what else?

904
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,040
[SPEAKER_28]: Um...

905
00:55:46,912 --> 00:55:51,616
[SPEAKER_28]: FU's stupid phone program not working because I can hear the phone, but I can't talk.

906
00:55:52,357 --> 00:55:57,201
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, it's kinda cool and all, but I like to talk, and that would be cool.

907
00:55:58,322 --> 00:55:58,902
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh, what else?

908
00:56:00,704 --> 00:56:06,869
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, I don't know, FU for not having that many good, you know, files coming out lately, friggin' sim files.

909
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:10,673
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, also the fact that Terrible Mr. Grinshaw was out today.

910
00:56:11,233 --> 00:56:13,715
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh yeah, Terrible Mr. Grinshaw came out today, yay.

911
00:56:14,376 --> 00:56:14,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

912
00:56:15,788 --> 00:56:22,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, all these phone programs that are for making phone calls on your PC that claim to be free, but they're not.

913
00:56:23,151 --> 00:56:23,551
[SPEAKER_20]: I hate that.

914
00:56:23,611 --> 00:56:28,392
[SPEAKER_20]: Why even say they're free if you're not going to make them free if you have to pay money to use the phone for free?

915
00:56:28,512 --> 00:56:37,275
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know, I'm not that smart and all, but paying money to use a phone for free is just paying to use the phone.

916
00:56:37,856 --> 00:56:43,398
[SPEAKER_28]: It's like saying, well, you're paying the 35 cents to use the payphone as a right to use the phone for free.

917
00:56:44,158 --> 00:56:44,758
[SPEAKER_28]: Makes no sense.

918
00:56:45,647 --> 00:56:47,468
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, let's see.

919
00:56:48,269 --> 00:56:49,029
[SPEAKER_28]: That's it.

920
00:56:49,169 --> 00:56:53,212
[SPEAKER_28]: I really didn't have anything because I've been kind of like busy with other stuff.

921
00:56:53,732 --> 00:56:55,754
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, yeah, I just really haven't been paying attention.

922
00:57:02,778 --> 00:57:06,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my FU of the week goes to exes that screw your friend in the shower.

923
00:57:06,821 --> 00:57:07,301
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

924
00:57:10,603 --> 00:57:11,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Short symbol to the point.

925
00:57:14,085 --> 00:57:14,806
[SPEAKER_24]: Brad, anything?

926
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:18,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about that, Rob.

927
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:19,680
[SPEAKER_03]: That's alright.

928
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,360
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens.

929
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,121
[SPEAKER_03]: No hard feelings there.

930
00:57:23,161 --> 00:57:25,201
[SPEAKER_02]: He just didn't fall into the penis.

931
00:57:26,541 --> 00:57:27,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not drag it out.

932
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:29,242
[SPEAKER_03]: His hand landed there.

933
00:57:31,902 --> 00:57:32,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Twenty times.

934
00:57:34,603 --> 00:57:35,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Up and down.

935
00:57:36,363 --> 00:57:37,583
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

936
00:57:38,344 --> 00:57:44,385
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm glad Loki brought that up about the crazy lady who won't take her veil off, because I wanted to expound on that.

937
00:57:44,405 --> 00:57:45,045
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a word, right?

938
00:57:45,481 --> 00:57:52,244
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if people know, but in this country, especially in California, just anywhere in the country, in America, driving, having a driver's license, is a privilege, not a right.

939
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:30,862
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have the right to have a driver's license, it's something you have to strive to get, you know, you have to go do it, and it's just a privilege, so, if you're not, you know, you can't fucking sue, I don't know if they are suing, but I would be surprised if they're trying to sue the country for not letting her have her fucking license picture taken, or having her license, but you can't do that, because it's not your right, we're not infringing on your rights as an American, or as a legal alien, or as an alien, because it's not your right to have a license!

940
00:58:31,402 --> 00:58:32,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking follow the rules!

941
00:58:33,775 --> 00:58:34,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Retard.

942
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:35,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and another thing.

943
00:58:36,036 --> 00:58:42,520
[SPEAKER_03]: All these people who are crossing the border from Mexico and stuff, who are getting killed because they're breaking the law.

944
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,281
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not racist, I'm just saying.

945
00:58:44,781 --> 00:58:49,484
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a law that says you can't try to, you know, you have to come in an illegal way.

946
00:58:49,544 --> 00:58:51,565
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do it illegally, you're a criminal.

947
00:58:51,865 --> 00:58:57,328
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you are a criminal by doing it illegally and you get hurt doing it, you can't sue our country, which has been happening.

948
00:58:57,628 --> 00:59:01,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're a freaking criminal in the first place for breaking an American law.

949
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:02,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's actually a true...

950
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Some sort of international law or something, I don't know.

951
00:59:05,843 --> 00:59:07,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, urgh, anger.

952
00:59:07,584 --> 00:59:08,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what did you just say, Matt?

953
00:59:09,786 --> 00:59:11,328
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh, MTV Music Awards are on.

954
00:59:11,508 --> 00:59:12,489
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, anyways, um, no.

955
00:59:13,009 --> 00:59:16,633
[SPEAKER_28]: My FB of the Week, actually, I forgot, is for stupid movie sequels.

956
00:59:17,473 --> 00:59:21,737
[SPEAKER_28]: For God's sake, stop making stupid... I'm kidding!

957
00:59:23,731 --> 00:59:24,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop it, Brad gets his ink.

958
00:59:26,934 --> 00:59:28,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for instance, Legally Blonde 2.

959
00:59:29,257 --> 00:59:31,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to watch Legally Blonde 1.

960
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:32,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to see a sequel of it.

961
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,601
[SPEAKER_02]: They're talking about making it Back to the Future 4.

962
00:59:35,615 --> 00:59:41,498
[SPEAKER_02]: They ended it fine, and now they're making it Back to the Future 4.

963
00:59:41,858 --> 00:59:47,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only will the two directors not be back for it, but Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox will not be in it.

964
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:48,962
[SPEAKER_02]: And it might be animated.

965
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:52,844
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, does he go back in time when he didn't have Parkinson's disease or whatever?

966
00:59:55,555 --> 00:59:59,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm supposed to go back to 1985, but my hand is shaking so much that I went to 485.

967
01:00:00,336 --> 01:00:02,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, the hijinks that ensue.

968
01:00:02,657 --> 01:00:04,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god.

969
01:00:04,858 --> 01:00:06,738
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wacky fun for the family.

970
01:00:07,038 --> 01:00:08,479
[SPEAKER_05]: You said hijinks, that's funny.

971
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,821
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, he wouldn't be so good at that gun game anymore.

972
01:00:17,361 --> 01:00:17,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

973
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:18,321
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

974
01:00:18,361 --> 01:00:19,202
[SPEAKER_13]: Ah, yeah, I'm done.

975
01:00:25,518 --> 01:00:28,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't a superhero movie with Christopher Reeve and Michael J. Fox be great?

976
01:00:31,383 --> 01:00:33,845
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be the Avengers of Handyman and the Tiny Avenger.

977
01:00:35,246 --> 01:00:35,627
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

978
01:00:38,709 --> 01:00:39,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

979
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:41,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Rice Princess, do you have anything you'd like to F you today?

980
01:00:42,492 --> 01:00:45,175
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you see, I'm kind of pissed off.

981
01:00:45,195 --> 01:00:45,335
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

982
01:00:45,635 --> 01:00:49,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you see, I'm kind of... No, I'm kidding.

983
01:00:49,859 --> 01:00:50,179
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kidding.

984
01:00:51,878 --> 01:00:54,360
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really have anything that I'm pissed off about.

985
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I do a love you of the week?

986
01:00:56,842 --> 01:00:57,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can do a love you of the week.

987
01:00:58,023 --> 01:00:58,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have love yous of the week?

988
01:00:58,984 --> 01:00:59,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.

989
01:00:59,244 --> 01:00:59,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

990
01:00:59,664 --> 01:01:04,428
[SPEAKER_07]: I give my love you to Rob because he bought me that Dog of Glee notebook and it was so cute.

991
01:01:04,488 --> 01:01:05,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

992
01:01:05,689 --> 01:01:06,450
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so great.

993
01:01:07,751 --> 01:01:09,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's the movie awards or whatever?

994
01:01:09,453 --> 01:01:13,076
[SPEAKER_02]: They're parading the Matrix here at the movie awards.

995
01:01:13,856 --> 01:01:15,498
[SPEAKER_05]: And a love you to Brad because he's cool.

996
01:01:15,658 --> 01:01:15,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

997
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:17,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Aww.

998
01:01:18,385 --> 01:01:18,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you too.

999
01:01:19,205 --> 01:01:19,966
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really weird.

1000
01:01:20,226 --> 01:01:22,526
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have Wanda Sykes as the oracle, that's great.

1001
01:01:22,546 --> 01:01:26,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt turned on this TV, it's the MTV Awards, Matrix thing.

1002
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:36,391
[SPEAKER_19]: Justin Timberlake is some sort of like... I wanted to see this, for the movie awards this year, they did a parody of the Matrix Reloaded, and I really wanted to see this.

1003
01:01:36,571 --> 01:01:40,953
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry that I've broken the FUs, I'm sure people can go ahead and, uh, yeah.

1004
01:01:41,353 --> 01:01:41,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait.

1005
01:01:41,733 --> 01:01:43,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's continue on with the FUs.

1006
01:01:44,414 --> 01:01:46,254
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to the MTV Movie Awards, call a sham.

1007
01:01:46,475 --> 01:01:47,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Justin Timberlake's dancing.

1008
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:49,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, he's doing the Matrix stuff.

1009
01:01:50,091 --> 01:01:50,611
[SPEAKER_02]: He's dancing.

1010
01:01:52,012 --> 01:01:54,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, uh, let's go to the chatroom FUs.

1011
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you done with your, uh, love use, Irene?

1012
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:56,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1013
01:01:57,295 --> 01:01:58,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the chatroom FUs, shall we?

1014
01:02:02,858 --> 01:02:08,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Puppy would like to say, or Black Lab, I should say, would like to say, fuck the ants that invaded my bathroom.

1015
01:02:08,281 --> 01:02:15,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck every single Kazaa WinMX user in my dorm for hogging all the bandwidth, even at 3 AM, and making my games play like shit online.

1016
01:02:16,158 --> 01:02:20,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck my ex-roommate for leaving a pile of garbage outside the window of the suite's living room.

1017
01:02:20,401 --> 01:02:22,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I have to clean it up because this lazy ass won't.

1018
01:02:22,983 --> 01:02:23,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck finals.

1019
01:02:24,264 --> 01:02:26,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you for not setting the webcam up.

1020
01:02:26,345 --> 01:02:27,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, fuck you, buddy.

1021
01:02:30,028 --> 01:02:33,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Mulheimer would like to say fuck the Matrix for ending out of nowhere.

1022
01:02:34,231 --> 01:02:36,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel like waiting until November because it was so good.

1023
01:02:36,773 --> 01:02:43,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck the Six Flags near me because they had to get rid of their four extremes because some bitch complained about the word bitch in it.

1024
01:02:44,702 --> 01:02:47,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, nobody even heard that at all.

1025
01:02:48,323 --> 01:02:55,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, we're kind of sidetracked by watching Sean William Scott playing Agent Smith.

1026
01:02:56,004 --> 01:02:58,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to come back to that later and make a little topic out of that.

1027
01:02:59,005 --> 01:02:59,845
[SPEAKER_02]: That was interesting.

1028
01:03:01,505 --> 01:03:04,646
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really stupid.

1029
01:03:04,726 --> 01:03:05,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, anyway, hi.

1030
01:03:06,386 --> 01:03:10,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck exams this week, and I don't normally say this because there is a reasoning for exams.

1031
01:03:10,526 --> 01:03:13,769
[SPEAKER_02]: But everyone is running around like chickens without dicks trying to remember everything.

1032
01:03:14,029 --> 01:03:15,811
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really annoying, so fuck them.

1033
01:03:19,414 --> 01:03:20,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Sharkskrl!

1034
01:03:20,896 --> 01:03:21,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Sharkskrl!

1035
01:03:21,897 --> 01:03:24,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Sharkskrl would like to say F you to everything!

1036
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:26,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything!

1037
01:03:26,201 --> 01:03:28,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I want everything's balls to die.

1038
01:03:28,623 --> 01:03:29,104
[SPEAKER_02]: That is all.

1039
01:03:30,165 --> 01:03:31,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Not my balls, please.

1040
01:03:31,946 --> 01:03:32,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna keep mine.

1041
01:03:36,033 --> 01:03:42,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Tetsuya would like to say, I have no FUs actually, just the happy news about the female that has contacted me over the past week.

1042
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, you can go sit in Irene's corner.

1043
01:03:47,965 --> 01:03:49,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you were listening to me, you'd know, so yeah.

1044
01:03:50,928 --> 01:03:54,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Ninst would like to say, just one this week, but it seems to be constant.

1045
01:03:54,732 --> 01:03:56,173
[SPEAKER_02]: FU'd my dial-up connection.

1046
01:03:57,354 --> 01:03:58,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry bud, wish there was more we could do for you.

1047
01:04:01,198 --> 01:04:07,261
[SPEAKER_02]: John Fields would like to say F you to IBM for making a floppy disk type called XDF that Windows can't read.

1048
01:04:07,281 --> 01:04:07,741
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1049
01:04:08,162 --> 01:04:11,343
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to having to move into a condo because of a divorce.

1050
01:04:11,964 --> 01:04:12,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Ouch.

1051
01:04:13,084 --> 01:04:15,465
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the pains of cleaning out a house.

1052
01:04:15,545 --> 01:04:19,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, huge F you to Dell because my 19-inch CRT died.

1053
01:04:19,587 --> 01:04:22,769
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only that, but so did my DVD plus RW drive.

1054
01:04:22,809 --> 01:04:24,330
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't burn DVD-R anymore.

1055
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:27,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sure, RW works fine, but R is much cheaper.

1056
01:04:27,651 --> 01:04:28,532
[SPEAKER_02]: F you, Dell.

1057
01:04:29,164 --> 01:04:32,585
[SPEAKER_02]: You better fix this stuff for free because of my warranty when I call you tomorrow.

1058
01:04:34,145 --> 01:04:35,126
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, oh, after that.

1059
01:04:35,166 --> 01:04:36,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he meant to type or else.

1060
01:04:36,726 --> 01:04:38,006
[SPEAKER_21]: Dude, you're getting a broken Dell.

1061
01:04:42,328 --> 01:04:43,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you're getting a dump.

1062
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:45,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1063
01:04:46,569 --> 01:04:48,909
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to summer school, says Nico Adachi.

1064
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:51,590
[SPEAKER_02]: That would suck if you have to go to summer school.

1065
01:04:51,610 --> 01:04:52,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1066
01:04:53,671 --> 01:04:58,492
[SPEAKER_02]: AkumaGM would like to say F you to my infernal MP3 player that decided to go on the blink.

1067
01:04:58,993 --> 01:05:01,974
[SPEAKER_02]: You used to work so well until you started to skip for no reason.

1068
01:05:02,474 --> 01:05:03,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you set MP3 player?

1069
01:05:03,954 --> 01:05:04,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I stab at thee.

1070
01:05:06,215 --> 01:05:07,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Why get an MP3 player anyway?

1071
01:05:07,515 --> 01:05:10,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I should get a CD player that can read MP3 on the CD.

1072
01:05:10,296 --> 01:05:11,596
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't read mines.

1073
01:05:14,236 --> 01:05:15,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just like to share.

1074
01:05:16,877 --> 01:05:19,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving right along, we have the 23rd Magus' FUs.

1075
01:05:21,898 --> 01:05:23,278
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to graduation rehearsal.

1076
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:25,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Four hours stuck in the football field in the hot sun.

1077
01:05:26,058 --> 01:05:30,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because 200 fucking seniors can't walk and step, it's Johnson, so they have to pimp strut.

1078
01:05:31,004 --> 01:05:32,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Sub-sunburnination.

1079
01:05:33,767 --> 01:05:34,387
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a new word.

1080
01:05:35,008 --> 01:05:39,853
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to me for being such a damn glutton and ordering the biggest sundae they have at Leather Bees in celebration.

1081
01:05:40,254 --> 01:05:40,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Burps.

1082
01:05:41,075 --> 01:05:42,296
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to summer visitation.

1083
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:44,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to go to Kentucky, goddammit.

1084
01:05:44,759 --> 01:05:46,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks for lawyers, damned if they are.

1085
01:05:50,424 --> 01:05:55,147
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Angel would like to say, F you to the egotistical bitch co-worker for making me work for her tomorrow.

1086
01:05:55,547 --> 01:05:56,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wait, more money for me.

1087
01:05:57,388 --> 01:06:01,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, still, F you to her for being an egotistical seniority-slinging bitch that she is.

1088
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:02,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay, I'm done.

1089
01:06:05,472 --> 01:06:10,575
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Tyrant would like to say, I have not gotten your F yous of the week.

1090
01:06:10,655 --> 01:06:11,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Send them to me over a private message.

1091
01:06:15,158 --> 01:06:18,640
[SPEAKER_13]: So... Well, sorry...

1092
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:25,906
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyway, I'm doing the show by myself right now, apparently, because the others have more important things to watch.

1093
01:06:27,047 --> 01:06:29,128
[SPEAKER_02]: So... Oh, Rob, I'm listening.

1094
01:06:30,549 --> 01:06:32,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm adding to the show, I think.

1095
01:06:35,132 --> 01:06:35,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that was funny.

1096
01:06:37,894 --> 01:06:38,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kidding.

1097
01:06:39,235 --> 01:06:40,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Rob, I think we should go to a break.

1098
01:06:41,477 --> 01:06:42,137
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's okay.

1099
01:06:42,317 --> 01:06:44,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still waiting for one more FU to come in.

1100
01:06:45,299 --> 01:06:48,121
[SPEAKER_13]: A world of pain all over your candy ass!

1101
01:06:48,742 --> 01:06:49,302
[SPEAKER_13]: Here it goes!

1102
01:06:50,117 --> 01:06:51,017
[SPEAKER_13]: Vis-a-vis!

1103
01:06:51,317 --> 01:06:52,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Concordantly!

1104
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:56,078
[SPEAKER_25]: Justin.

1105
01:06:56,558 --> 01:06:56,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1106
01:06:57,198 --> 01:06:58,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.

1107
01:07:00,379 --> 01:07:00,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1108
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:04,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to say an F you to MTV.

1109
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because they suck anyway.

1110
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Matt turned it on in the first place.

1111
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:08,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

1112
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:13,461
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to Matt.

1113
01:07:14,761 --> 01:07:19,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so... I guess I'll get to that one missing F you later.

1114
01:07:20,151 --> 01:07:21,953
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, I guess I ought to go to break.

1115
01:07:23,475 --> 01:07:24,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't feel like doing a show myself.

1116
01:07:27,079 --> 01:07:31,564
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be back after this potpourri of Bomani music.

1117
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:33,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy, boys and girls.

1118
01:08:05,959 --> 01:08:35,037
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Bright Light starring Noco Flo A kung fu fighter in a disco He's out to take his chance, he knows the hundreds in the house Only go for romance He's got a white suit on, five past one and the night has just begun Cause when he lays it on with style, a lady's man with a nice smile And right before his eyes, sees a pretty young thing looking real fly He wants to make the score, so he takes a hand and leads her to the dance floor He's giving her line after line, she tells him that he looks real fine

1119
01:08:37,672 --> 01:08:38,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what he's come for, buy it

1120
01:09:31,937 --> 01:09:32,620
Thanks for watching!

1121
01:10:33,658 --> 01:10:34,399
Thanks for watching!

1122
01:13:11,946 --> 01:13:16,028
I feel, I feel You are the only one that can feel this way I feel, I feel

1123
01:13:53,755 --> 01:13:56,996
[SPEAKER_27]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

1124
01:13:57,576 --> 01:13:59,296
[SPEAKER_27]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1125
01:14:01,797 --> 01:14:02,237
[SPEAKER_02]: We are back.

1126
01:14:02,757 --> 01:14:04,198
[SPEAKER_02]: And you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1127
01:14:05,238 --> 01:14:07,118
[SPEAKER_02]: And Brad's splashing me liquor.

1128
01:14:07,178 --> 01:14:08,239
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants me to start drinking.

1129
01:14:08,279 --> 01:14:12,039
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I already got pretty toasty last night.

1130
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:13,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I need to get drunk again.

1131
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:14,320
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1132
01:14:16,501 --> 01:14:16,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1133
01:14:19,841 --> 01:14:20,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1134
01:14:20,181 --> 01:14:20,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I can have one.

1135
01:14:23,345 --> 01:14:24,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to go outside.

1136
01:14:24,466 --> 01:14:25,627
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, Brad, bring me one.

1137
01:14:25,907 --> 01:14:26,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I can have one.

1138
01:14:27,528 --> 01:14:28,849
[SPEAKER_02]: One will loosen me up a little bit.

1139
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:30,250
[SPEAKER_02]: One or two or ten.

1140
01:14:31,731 --> 01:14:33,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually with Rob, one leads to two.

1141
01:14:33,253 --> 01:14:34,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, can I take one home with me?

1142
01:14:36,495 --> 01:14:37,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't carry an open container in the car.

1143
01:14:38,697 --> 01:14:39,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can take one home with you.

1144
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to drink something before I'm driving.

1145
01:14:45,942 --> 01:14:46,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm responsible.

1146
01:14:53,795 --> 01:14:55,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't drink and do radio, kids.

1147
01:14:58,977 --> 01:14:59,677
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not underage.

1148
01:14:59,717 --> 01:15:01,858
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're underage, you must have your parents' permission to drink.

1149
01:15:02,518 --> 01:15:05,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Although people at restaurants seem to think that I'm like 18.

1150
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:06,820
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't look 18.

1151
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:12,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever been carded in an R-rated movie?

1152
01:15:12,882 --> 01:15:13,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1153
01:15:13,143 --> 01:15:14,303
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit would piss me off.

1154
01:15:15,584 --> 01:15:18,885
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you... You look like... Oh!

1155
01:15:19,305 --> 01:15:19,505
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1156
01:15:19,705 --> 01:15:19,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh!

1157
01:15:19,885 --> 01:15:21,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I have good news.

1158
01:15:21,126 --> 01:15:21,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.

1159
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:25,693
[SPEAKER_05]: This is more centered toward Loki.

1160
01:15:26,353 --> 01:15:27,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when we went to see The Matrix?

1161
01:15:28,514 --> 01:15:30,335
[SPEAKER_05]: And remember that crap with the thing and the credits?

1162
01:15:31,436 --> 01:15:31,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what?

1163
01:15:32,597 --> 01:15:38,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I got six bucks from the movie theater and a $2 off coupon.

1164
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,041
[SPEAKER_05]: How'd you get six bucks?

1165
01:15:41,022 --> 01:15:43,163
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave them my ticket and told them what happened.

1166
01:15:45,144 --> 01:15:45,724
[SPEAKER_05]: You should do that.

1167
01:15:45,764 --> 01:15:46,245
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll get money.

1168
01:15:50,003 --> 01:15:52,685
[SPEAKER_05]: They turned on the lights and ended the movie.

1169
01:15:55,046 --> 01:15:57,287
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they turned it back on, but didn't really turn the lights off.

1170
01:15:58,488 --> 01:16:01,270
[SPEAKER_21]: You mean like before the trailer came on?

1171
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:02,510
[SPEAKER_21]: Like during the credits or the end?

1172
01:16:03,111 --> 01:16:03,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1173
01:16:03,391 --> 01:16:06,052
[SPEAKER_05]: So when Mar and John was in town, we went to see X-Men 2.

1174
01:16:07,113 --> 01:16:12,596
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was just thinking, you know, so I have that ticket, and I personally wonder if they would, you know, give me like a movie pass or something.

1175
01:16:13,036 --> 01:16:17,579
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went and told them about it, and they gave me money off of another movie ticket, and then they gave me money.

1176
01:16:18,439 --> 01:16:18,680
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.

1177
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:19,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like...

1178
01:16:19,801 --> 01:16:21,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, she should totally take your ticket there.

1179
01:16:22,463 --> 01:16:25,064
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like we never saw the movie because they never tore our tickets.

1180
01:16:25,785 --> 01:16:34,730
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we just walked right by them because we got there, like, I guess there was this, what happened was we were thinking, I was thinking of getting a Fandango ticket the night before, you know, buying them online.

1181
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:42,274
[SPEAKER_21]: But I was like, you know what, maybe they'll be, I don't know, I don't want to wait in line, you know, a huge line if a bunch of people bought Fandango tickets or whatever.

1182
01:16:42,715 --> 01:16:45,076
[SPEAKER_21]: Because then you have to wait on a Fandango ticket line or whatever, you know.

1183
01:16:45,512 --> 01:16:49,936
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just went there early, and there had to be two other showings happening before that weren't posed the night before.

1184
01:16:50,336 --> 01:16:54,539
[SPEAKER_21]: So we got these two showings that nobody had tickets for, because everybody bought Fandango tickets.

1185
01:16:55,160 --> 01:17:01,445
[SPEAKER_21]: And so we went in there, and there was no, what do you call them, the person who, the chauffeur, taking the tickets.

1186
01:17:01,805 --> 01:17:07,090
[SPEAKER_21]: So we just walked in there, we could've, like, I don't know, probably gone and seen another movie, or, Usher, that's what he calls him.

1187
01:17:07,670 --> 01:17:08,931
[SPEAKER_21]: Gottman's chauffeur.

1188
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:12,414
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, thanks James, or Jeeves, or whatever.

1189
01:17:13,444 --> 01:17:22,312
[SPEAKER_21]: So I don't know, we probably could have sold the tickets, I don't know.

1190
01:17:22,512 --> 01:17:23,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, Loki gets a present.

1191
01:17:23,953 --> 01:17:27,156
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't use it for like a new movie, but any movie that's already out.

1192
01:17:28,877 --> 01:17:31,059
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a 2, or a 1 car.

1193
01:17:31,159 --> 01:17:32,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't hardly go to movies anymore, so.

1194
01:17:32,801 --> 01:17:35,823
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, um...

1195
01:17:39,494 --> 01:17:45,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving right along, did we want to get into Cage Match or does anybody else have something they want to say?

1196
01:17:45,296 --> 01:17:46,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you not have a song still?

1197
01:17:46,276 --> 01:17:47,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Because your song's first, buddy.

1198
01:17:50,257 --> 01:17:51,558
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh, no, I don't have anything yet.

1199
01:17:51,618 --> 01:17:53,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you had the vinyl you wanted to do.

1200
01:17:54,699 --> 01:17:55,039
[SPEAKER_28]: I did?

1201
01:17:56,899 --> 01:17:58,960
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh... Oh, yeah.

1202
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you do that?

1203
01:18:00,541 --> 01:18:01,001
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I'll do that.

1204
01:18:01,381 --> 01:18:01,681
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1205
01:18:02,121 --> 01:18:03,842
[SPEAKER_02]: You're up first, bud, so get that vinyl out.

1206
01:18:05,462 --> 01:18:06,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1207
01:18:06,783 --> 01:18:07,983
[SPEAKER_05]: You know they have it in Ragnarok?

1208
01:18:08,615 --> 01:18:09,395
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they have in Ragnarok?

1209
01:18:09,415 --> 01:18:09,936
[SPEAKER_05]: The Pooh hat.

1210
01:18:10,976 --> 01:18:13,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I found the stop sign hat today, someone was selling one.

1211
01:18:14,657 --> 01:18:17,939
[SPEAKER_05]: You walk around with a stop sign on your head, and then there's a mask that makes you gothy.

1212
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:21,780
[SPEAKER_21]: I like the pretend murder, it's a giant knife in your head.

1213
01:18:22,481 --> 01:18:23,561
[SPEAKER_21]: You walk around with a knife in your head.

1214
01:18:24,081 --> 01:18:26,562
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's one that's an apple with an arrow in your head, so you can be arrowed.

1215
01:18:28,723 --> 01:18:29,784
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want Imperium.

1216
01:18:33,165 --> 01:18:33,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.

1217
01:18:33,885 --> 01:18:34,365
[SPEAKER_05]: I fell in for 625,000.

1218
01:18:36,926 --> 01:18:40,829
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want Empyrean so I can start a guild and call it I Kick Your Ass Guild.

1219
01:18:41,609 --> 01:18:43,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Or like Battle Royale, which is my party's name.

1220
01:18:46,552 --> 01:18:47,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we ready for Cage Match?

1221
01:18:48,253 --> 01:18:48,554
[SPEAKER_13]: Mm-hmm.

1222
01:18:48,854 --> 01:18:49,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1223
01:18:50,035 --> 01:19:03,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match, for the fourth week, Loki's pick from the Matrix Reloaded soundtrack, Mona Lisa Overdrive, won... They all know how it goes.

1224
01:19:03,463 --> 01:19:04,024
[SPEAKER_02]: ...once again...

1225
01:19:04,966 --> 01:19:07,387
[SPEAKER_02]: So here it is, one last time, a little piece of it.

1226
01:19:08,067 --> 01:19:08,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Mona Lisa Overdrive.

1227
01:19:08,867 --> 01:19:09,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Because guess what, kids?

1228
01:19:09,968 --> 01:19:14,029
[SPEAKER_02]: When this song is in rotation four weeks, it is retired.

1229
01:19:14,189 --> 01:19:15,849
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like TRL up in this shit.

1230
01:19:16,189 --> 01:19:20,171
[SPEAKER_02]: So, here's a little clip of Mona Lisa Overdrive, and it's retirement.

1231
01:19:21,251 --> 01:19:22,731
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, the winning song.

1232
01:19:25,072 --> 01:19:26,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna skip her out, sorry.

1233
01:19:33,735 --> 01:19:34,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

1234
01:19:36,454 --> 01:19:37,495
[SPEAKER_25]: That's it, it's gone.

1235
01:19:38,416 --> 01:19:42,939
[SPEAKER_02]: So, alright, that was Mona Lisa Overdrive and it's out.

1236
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:50,245
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all three of us have brand new picks this week because Mona Lisa Overdrive may no longer participate.

1237
01:19:50,305 --> 01:19:52,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you need a little more time, Loki, because I have some late FUs I can read.

1238
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:58,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki needs a little more time, so I'm going to read some late FUs.

1239
01:19:58,772 --> 01:19:59,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're good?

1240
01:19:59,373 --> 01:20:01,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I need to do these anyway, so I'm going to read some late FUs.

1241
01:20:01,995 --> 01:20:05,338
[SPEAKER_02]: So, late FUs, shame on you for being late.

1242
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:07,200
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1243
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:09,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I have way too much fun with those sound clips.

1244
01:20:09,801 --> 01:20:10,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1245
01:20:11,822 --> 01:20:12,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Late FUs.

1246
01:20:12,542 --> 01:20:13,062
[SPEAKER_02]: From Nintz.

1247
01:20:13,682 --> 01:20:16,643
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to my connection because I didn't get to hear my first FU.

1248
01:20:16,803 --> 01:20:19,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I take my socks off a lot.

1249
01:20:19,264 --> 01:20:19,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1250
01:20:20,945 --> 01:20:21,325
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1251
01:20:32,057 --> 01:20:36,899
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Tyron would like to say, F you to my ISP, I have to go through a proxy server to access the chatroom.

1252
01:20:36,959 --> 01:20:38,520
[SPEAKER_02]: ISPs are dumb that block sites.

1253
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,461
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to not having broadband.

1254
01:20:40,921 --> 01:20:44,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually sad now that I'm leaving high school, so F you to heading out to real life.

1255
01:20:44,403 --> 01:20:47,985
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been great hanging out with all you great people, but now we're going to go our separate ways.

1256
01:20:48,986 --> 01:20:49,146
[SPEAKER_14]: Aww.

1257
01:20:50,847 --> 01:20:55,549
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the people at the LAN party yesterday who just wanted to play the fastest map possible on StarCraft.

1258
01:20:55,569 --> 01:20:56,090
[SPEAKER_02]: You're dumb.

1259
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:59,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop using noobs maps and try to beat me because you don't know how to play a strategy game.

1260
01:20:59,311 --> 01:21:00,512
[SPEAKER_02]: And F you to them at Counter-Strike.

1261
01:21:01,038 --> 01:21:03,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Just using the AWP shows you have no skill.

1262
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:07,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Girls, please, I'm begging you, will you please stop ignoring me when I talk to you, please?

1263
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't talk to me when I'm doing FBs.

1264
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:10,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done now.

1265
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:10,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me a jewel case.

1266
01:21:11,381 --> 01:21:12,081
[SPEAKER_02]: You want a jewel case?

1267
01:21:12,621 --> 01:21:14,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a sleeve or something.

1268
01:21:15,302 --> 01:21:16,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a big one or a little one?

1269
01:21:18,022 --> 01:21:19,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where one is over here, you guys.

1270
01:21:21,263 --> 01:21:22,003
[SPEAKER_02]: How about here?

1271
01:21:25,704 --> 01:21:26,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1272
01:21:26,764 --> 01:21:28,685
[SPEAKER_02]: So, back to the cage match.

1273
01:21:31,638 --> 01:21:32,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that sound effect.

1274
01:21:32,799 --> 01:21:33,139
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1275
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:40,162
[SPEAKER_02]: This week in the Orange Launch Cage match, now that Mona Lisa Overdrive has been retired, Loki's up first.

1276
01:21:40,222 --> 01:21:41,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, tell us about your pick.

1277
01:21:41,843 --> 01:21:42,523
[SPEAKER_02]: This should be great.

1278
01:21:44,504 --> 01:21:47,546
[SPEAKER_20]: This is from our girlfriend, because she loves Donna Summers.

1279
01:21:48,046 --> 01:21:56,530
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's the song... I would say that Donna Summers is like... Well, obviously, she'd be like the erotic, but... You know, like the 70s and 70s age...

1280
01:21:57,907 --> 01:22:00,608
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, this song is Love to Love You Baby.

1281
01:22:01,228 --> 01:22:04,009
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe it's been featured in a few movies and stuff.

1282
01:22:05,249 --> 01:22:11,011
[SPEAKER_20]: It's also one of my stronger picks because, you know, I gotta give the other people some chance, you know, so here we go.

1283
01:22:11,952 --> 01:22:12,692
[SPEAKER_20]: Love to Love You Baby.

1284
01:22:14,712 --> 01:22:16,453
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, here it is, Love to Love You Baby.

1285
01:22:24,222 --> 01:22:48,348
[SPEAKER_13]: I love to love you, baby I love to love you, baby I love to love you, baby I love to love you, baby I love to love you, baby When you're laying so close to me There's no place around that you're believing in me Yeah

1286
01:23:07,643 --> 01:23:08,825
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

1287
01:23:40,607 --> 01:23:41,489
Thank you for watching!

1288
01:25:25,837 --> 01:25:27,257
Wacka Wacka Baby Baby

1289
01:25:55,433 --> 01:25:56,395
Thank you for watching!

1290
01:26:18,484 --> 01:26:18,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

1291
01:26:19,685 --> 01:26:20,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, then.

1292
01:26:21,465 --> 01:26:22,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, it's over.

1293
01:26:22,506 --> 01:26:23,567
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first pick.

1294
01:26:23,627 --> 01:26:25,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Donna Summer would love to love you, baby.

1295
01:26:25,968 --> 01:26:28,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, let's go around and get the room's thoughts on that.

1296
01:26:28,909 --> 01:26:29,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, it's over.

1297
01:26:29,729 --> 01:26:31,790
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what did you think of that one?

1298
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:33,191
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked Donna Summer.

1299
01:26:33,651 --> 01:26:40,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, she did, you know, a good version of MacArthur Park, which was later parodied into Jurassic Park.

1300
01:26:42,396 --> 01:26:47,198
[SPEAKER_05]: And she did Bad Girls.

1301
01:26:47,694 --> 01:26:48,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember?

1302
01:26:48,114 --> 01:26:48,795
[SPEAKER_05]: She did that, girls.

1303
01:26:48,835 --> 01:26:49,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Second mix.

1304
01:26:49,775 --> 01:26:50,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1305
01:26:51,076 --> 01:26:53,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, her version wasn't in the second mix, but she did that.

1306
01:26:53,498 --> 01:26:54,959
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway.

1307
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:58,361
[SPEAKER_05]: But that song, you can't disco to it, okay?

1308
01:26:58,901 --> 01:27:03,684
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only, and it's too slow to get like a good, you know, you know... It is bump to.

1309
01:27:03,704 --> 01:27:04,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Sex music.

1310
01:27:04,604 --> 01:27:05,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

1311
01:27:05,205 --> 01:27:07,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you not notice the moaning in the background?

1312
01:27:07,947 --> 01:27:10,068
[SPEAKER_05]: But that would not be any good for sex either.

1313
01:27:10,588 --> 01:27:11,269
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too slow.

1314
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:13,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Studio 54 music.

1315
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:14,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Studio 54 music, okay?

1316
01:27:14,451 --> 01:27:14,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

1317
01:27:14,671 --> 01:27:14,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1318
01:27:17,959 --> 01:27:27,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, the only thing that would make that good for like, like even, what were you saying it was good for, anal?

1319
01:27:28,167 --> 01:27:28,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1320
01:27:28,987 --> 01:27:30,989
[SPEAKER_05]: If the person was constipated.

1321
01:27:31,930 --> 01:27:33,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1322
01:27:33,771 --> 01:27:35,913
[SPEAKER_02]: On a station, on a scale of one to ten?

1323
01:27:37,454 --> 01:27:37,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Three.

1324
01:27:38,695 --> 01:27:38,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1325
01:27:39,035 --> 01:27:43,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because it gets a little bit of good because Donna Summer has a very nice voice.

1326
01:27:43,338 --> 01:27:43,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, she does.

1327
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:45,580
[SPEAKER_05]: But her moaning needs to go.

1328
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, lanky style.

1329
01:27:47,850 --> 01:27:48,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Your thoughts?

1330
01:27:50,852 --> 01:27:51,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm here.

1331
01:27:54,255 --> 01:28:02,181
[SPEAKER_03]: My rating for it, probably, as like a song, I give it, you know, for what it does in its genre, I think it's pretty good, it's 8.

1332
01:28:03,121 --> 01:28:06,003
[SPEAKER_03]: But for being on our station, I give it a 2.

1333
01:28:06,404 --> 01:28:07,905
[SPEAKER_03]: It should not be on Orange Lounge.

1334
01:28:09,506 --> 01:28:09,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Who?

1335
01:28:10,767 --> 01:28:12,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, who that?

1336
01:28:12,628 --> 01:28:13,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Rice Princess.

1337
01:28:17,487 --> 01:28:18,508
[SPEAKER_07]: The song sucked.

1338
01:28:18,628 --> 01:28:20,908
[SPEAKER_07]: It was way boring, too.

1339
01:28:21,249 --> 01:28:21,729
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki!

1340
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:24,190
[SPEAKER_20]: What's he doing in my chair?

1341
01:28:24,210 --> 01:28:25,310
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like all breaking.

1342
01:28:28,591 --> 01:28:29,151
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyways.

1343
01:28:30,732 --> 01:28:36,013
[SPEAKER_20]: I give it an 8 because it's the best damn sex music that's on this record.

1344
01:28:37,134 --> 01:28:40,755
[SPEAKER_20]: And you have to understand it's sex making out music.

1345
01:28:40,835 --> 01:28:41,955
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not meant to be dancing.

1346
01:28:41,995 --> 01:28:43,816
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't dance while you're supposed to be having sex.

1347
01:28:44,349 --> 01:28:47,091
[SPEAKER_20]: This is like when I watch TV instead of having sex.

1348
01:28:49,673 --> 01:28:50,634
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, that's different, okay?

1349
01:28:50,654 --> 01:28:52,655
[SPEAKER_20]: That had more of an upbeat to it, okay?

1350
01:28:52,695 --> 01:28:54,797
[SPEAKER_20]: And they knew that they were there at the Dance Dance Fuck.

1351
01:28:54,857 --> 01:28:55,698
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, this is like Studio 54.

1352
01:28:57,659 --> 01:28:59,420
[SPEAKER_20]: I have two words for that song.

1353
01:29:02,923 --> 01:29:06,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Dumbass, it's not a word, it's a sound clip.

1354
01:29:06,626 --> 01:29:09,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather listen to the Dance Dance Fuck music than that.

1355
01:29:09,828 --> 01:29:10,629
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was okay.

1356
01:29:10,709 --> 01:29:10,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

1357
01:29:11,519 --> 01:29:14,060
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what my next week's cage match pick is going to be.

1358
01:29:15,501 --> 01:29:16,502
[SPEAKER_02]: The moaning was cool.

1359
01:29:16,862 --> 01:29:17,562
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give it that.

1360
01:29:18,142 --> 01:29:23,305
[SPEAKER_02]: But otherwise, I'm glad that I no longer have the crappiest cage match pick in Orange Lounge history.

1361
01:29:23,365 --> 01:29:24,166
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for that.

1362
01:29:24,526 --> 01:29:26,627
[SPEAKER_02]: So for that, I won't give you a one.

1363
01:29:26,647 --> 01:29:28,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you a two.

1364
01:29:28,568 --> 01:29:30,129
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't even try to find bad.

1365
01:29:30,169 --> 01:29:31,169
[SPEAKER_20]: You want me to find bad.

1366
01:29:31,309 --> 01:29:31,649
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, man.

1367
01:29:31,689 --> 01:29:32,190
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

1368
01:29:32,210 --> 01:29:32,570
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

1369
01:29:33,150 --> 01:29:33,410
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1370
01:29:33,470 --> 01:29:36,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of my picks, let's get to my pick for this week.

1371
01:29:37,332 --> 01:29:38,653
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a little trancy song.

1372
01:29:38,673 --> 01:29:40,494
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an artist that was suggested to me.

1373
01:29:41,095 --> 01:29:43,517
[SPEAKER_02]: You, nothing but you The reason for living I lay my life on you

1374
01:30:10,017 --> 01:30:14,420
You, nothing but you, you're calling to me, I lay my hand on you

1375
01:31:51,782 --> 01:32:11,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing but you, the reason for living, I lay my love on you You, nothing but you, the calling to be in, I lay my hand on you

1376
01:32:20,888 --> 01:32:22,329
Thanks for watching!

1377
01:33:28,363 --> 01:33:32,205
[SPEAKER_13]: You, nothing but you The calling to be in I lay my hand on you You

1378
01:33:51,058 --> 01:33:56,900
[SPEAKER_02]: My pick for the case match this week, that was Nomi with you, and I don't think anyone in here was listening, but let's see anyway.

1379
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:57,941
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of boring.

1380
01:33:58,001 --> 01:33:59,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, you thought it was boring?

1381
01:33:59,161 --> 01:34:00,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was going to put me to sleep.

1382
01:34:01,342 --> 01:34:05,503
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty, so it gets like a 7, but it made me sleepy.

1383
01:34:05,884 --> 01:34:06,604
[SPEAKER_02]: It made you sleepy.

1384
01:34:07,024 --> 01:34:09,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyone else want to comment on Nomi, you?

1385
01:34:11,346 --> 01:34:11,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Eh.

1386
01:34:13,126 --> 01:34:14,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Eh, 3, it was kind of boring.

1387
01:34:16,307 --> 01:34:17,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Play some good stuff on there.

1388
01:34:17,768 --> 01:34:18,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd stick my tongue out at you.

1389
01:34:19,749 --> 01:34:20,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Brad?

1390
01:34:22,503 --> 01:34:23,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we talking about playing good stuff?

1391
01:34:23,904 --> 01:34:25,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge means crap.

1392
01:34:26,406 --> 01:34:27,667
[SPEAKER_21]: Crap radio, crap music.

1393
01:34:27,847 --> 01:34:28,907
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for listening, everybody.

1394
01:34:30,408 --> 01:34:31,890
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, it was alright.

1395
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:32,530
[SPEAKER_21]: It was mediocre.

1396
01:34:32,650 --> 01:34:33,090
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd say 7.

1397
01:34:35,332 --> 01:34:35,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1398
01:34:38,894 --> 01:34:39,315
[SPEAKER_20]: Give me the mic.

1399
01:34:39,335 --> 01:34:39,515
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1400
01:34:40,015 --> 01:34:41,456
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, it was okay.

1401
01:34:41,476 --> 01:34:43,057
[SPEAKER_20]: It started off good for like 5 seconds.

1402
01:34:43,177 --> 01:34:44,658
[SPEAKER_20]: Damn, my poster's all fucked up!

1403
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:45,479
[SPEAKER_20]: Nah, anyway.

1404
01:34:45,919 --> 01:34:49,922
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, so then... Yeah, it was alright.

1405
01:34:50,042 --> 01:34:51,183
[SPEAKER_20]: It was like... I don't know.

1406
01:34:52,234 --> 01:35:00,897
[SPEAKER_20]: I was just going to say, you're lucky that I played the Donna Summer song because Rob was suggesting that I play Party All The Time by Eddie Murphy.

1407
01:35:00,977 --> 01:35:02,117
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'd be glad.

1408
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:04,558
[SPEAKER_20]: I have plenty of other really shitty records that I could have played.

1409
01:35:07,278 --> 01:35:12,700
[SPEAKER_02]: My song was fabulous, as it always is, and it'll be the sleeper hit of Orange Lounge 2003.

1410
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:13,600
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets a 10.

1411
01:35:15,381 --> 01:35:15,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Next!

1412
01:35:16,141 --> 01:35:16,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, next.

1413
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:19,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, would you be kind enough to intro your pick for us?

1414
01:35:20,069 --> 01:35:23,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic Plastic Machine with Take Me to the Disco.

1415
01:35:23,650 --> 01:35:24,611
[SPEAKER_02]: And what else did they do?

1416
01:35:24,971 --> 01:35:26,872
[SPEAKER_05]: They did Beautiful Days and Beatmania CDX.

1417
01:35:27,052 --> 01:35:27,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Buy their album.

1418
01:35:27,732 --> 01:35:28,352
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Beautiful.

1419
01:35:28,492 --> 01:35:29,292
[SPEAKER_05]: It's released in the U.S.

1420
01:35:29,713 --> 01:35:31,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it at half.com for $6.

1421
01:35:32,053 --> 01:35:32,854
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, here it is.

1422
01:35:33,254 --> 01:35:34,034
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the name again?

1423
01:35:35,155 --> 01:35:36,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Take Me to the Disco.

1424
01:35:36,615 --> 01:35:37,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that right?

1425
01:35:37,475 --> 01:35:38,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's Disco After Something.

1426
01:35:39,576 --> 01:35:39,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it is?

1427
01:35:40,276 --> 01:35:41,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Disco at the End of the World.

1428
01:35:41,617 --> 01:35:41,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's it.

1429
01:35:42,017 --> 01:35:42,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Disco at the End of the World.

1430
01:35:42,717 --> 01:35:44,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they do a song called Take Me to the Disco.

1431
01:35:44,858 --> 01:35:45,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was one.

1432
01:35:45,538 --> 01:35:45,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.

1433
01:35:46,439 --> 01:35:46,939
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

1434
01:35:47,287 --> 01:35:47,768
[SPEAKER_02]: We forgive you.

1435
01:35:47,928 --> 01:35:50,431
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Disco at the End of the World by Fantastic Plastic Machine.

1436
01:35:52,374 --> 01:35:52,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

1437
01:40:26,952 --> 01:40:30,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, a fantastic classic machine with disco at the end of the world.

1438
01:40:30,333 --> 01:40:32,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear what folks thought.

1439
01:40:32,733 --> 01:40:36,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to bring you a copy of the original Take Me to the Disco.

1440
01:40:37,594 --> 01:40:40,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because it's like, you'll hear what parts they took to make that.

1441
01:40:40,554 --> 01:40:44,855
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a weird remix of the song, which for me, I think it's just kind of neat to play Ragnarok to that music.

1442
01:40:45,695 --> 01:40:50,156
[SPEAKER_05]: So I give it an 8 myself, just because it's one of my neat little things I listen to when I'm bored.

1443
01:40:50,956 --> 01:40:52,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty, Lanky Stout?

1444
01:40:54,217 --> 01:40:55,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, hard to say.

1445
01:40:56,077 --> 01:40:56,197
[SPEAKER_02]: It's

1446
01:40:57,296 --> 01:41:00,537
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe it's a little too repetitive for me, so I'd have to probably give it like a 6.

1447
01:41:02,718 --> 01:41:06,059
[SPEAKER_21]: And also, you know, Beautiful Days is so much better than that song.

1448
01:41:06,479 --> 01:41:08,300
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess I've been jaded by that song.

1449
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:10,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Bryce Princess?

1450
01:41:12,401 --> 01:41:16,563
[SPEAKER_07]: It was way better than the crap that you played the last two songs, so I give it a 7.

1451
01:41:18,003 --> 01:41:18,403
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1452
01:41:18,703 --> 01:41:19,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki?

1453
01:41:20,644 --> 01:41:20,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh.

1454
01:41:22,505 --> 01:41:23,405
[SPEAKER_02]: And on a scale of 1 to 10?

1455
01:41:23,565 --> 01:41:23,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh.

1456
01:41:26,406 --> 01:41:26,786
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1457
01:41:28,099 --> 01:41:32,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I found myself bopping my head to it a little bit, kind of like a Night at the Roxbury type thing, so that was pretty cool.

1458
01:41:33,222 --> 01:41:35,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I agreed to get it maybe a little bit repetitive, but not too bad.

1459
01:41:35,804 --> 01:41:39,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I could put up with it.

1460
01:41:39,266 --> 01:41:41,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I could put up for maybe three minutes of it, just not four.

1461
01:41:41,508 --> 01:41:46,351
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was still pretty cool, so I give it a... I give it an eight.

1462
01:41:46,792 --> 01:41:47,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

1463
01:41:47,933 --> 01:41:56,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so, let's run through the three songs you can vote for one more time, and then you can send your votes in over private message to Sky in the chat room.

1464
01:41:56,258 --> 01:41:56,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Here they are.

1465
01:41:57,372 --> 01:42:03,996
[SPEAKER_02]: You can vote for Donna Summer with, uh, what the hell was that called?

1466
01:42:04,217 --> 01:42:05,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Love to Love Ya, Baby.

1467
01:42:06,118 --> 01:42:07,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Play a little clip for me.

1468
01:42:08,119 --> 01:42:09,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Just drop it in the middle and hit start.

1469
01:42:13,162 --> 01:42:13,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

1470
01:42:15,784 --> 01:42:16,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

1471
01:42:18,526 --> 01:42:20,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's Donna Summer with Love to Love Ya, Baby.

1472
01:42:20,988 --> 01:42:22,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can vote for Nomi with You.

1473
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:34,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can vote for Fantastic Plastic Machine with Disco at the end of the world.

1474
01:42:45,876 --> 01:42:47,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so there they are.

1475
01:42:47,156 --> 01:42:48,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Send in your votes now.

1476
01:42:48,777 --> 01:42:50,177
[SPEAKER_02]: The voting is open now.

1477
01:42:50,257 --> 01:42:52,198
[SPEAKER_02]: So send those votes to Sky in the chat room.

1478
01:42:52,728 --> 01:43:00,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Write in candidates for a song that was not played as one of those three will be thrown out and you cannot vote again and we will taunt you and make fun of you openly on the show.

1479
01:43:01,433 --> 01:43:03,354
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll find you and start drawing on you.

1480
01:43:03,774 --> 01:43:06,235
[SPEAKER_02]: We will wiggle our private parts in your general direction.

1481
01:43:07,276 --> 01:43:10,197
[SPEAKER_05]: My mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries.

1482
01:43:10,357 --> 01:43:15,620
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't threaten to not vote for anything because we've already gotten one vote so we have a winner either way.

1483
01:43:15,860 --> 01:43:19,802
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it comes down to one vote then I guess it'll be a one vote win.

1484
01:43:20,463 --> 01:43:21,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine by me.

1485
01:43:22,674 --> 01:43:26,115
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're evil dictators and we always get our way.

1486
01:43:27,336 --> 01:43:29,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Either evil dictators or just evil dicks, I don't know.

1487
01:43:30,037 --> 01:43:30,477
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1488
01:43:32,177 --> 01:43:33,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so.

1489
01:43:33,458 --> 01:43:36,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, by the way, you need to get rid of the Furby, okay?

1490
01:43:36,699 --> 01:43:37,159
[SPEAKER_02]: The Furby?

1491
01:43:37,259 --> 01:43:38,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I love my Furby.

1492
01:43:38,199 --> 01:43:39,740
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to put the Furby in the back.

1493
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:42,141
[SPEAKER_02]: My Furby's cool.

1494
01:43:44,061 --> 01:43:45,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, give me.

1495
01:43:46,002 --> 01:43:46,282
Hey.

1496
01:43:46,742 --> 01:43:47,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.

1497
01:43:48,423 --> 01:43:49,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the parrot's coming.

1498
01:43:50,183 --> 01:43:50,964
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the coyote.

1499
01:43:51,404 --> 01:43:52,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's the coyote.

1500
01:43:52,461 --> 01:43:56,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's like the desert dog.

1501
01:43:56,503 --> 01:43:58,965
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a parrot coyote.

1502
01:43:59,265 --> 01:44:07,630
[SPEAKER_13]: Very interesting.

1503
01:44:07,850 --> 01:44:11,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to stop drinking now because I have to run to the store after the show's over.

1504
01:44:12,433 --> 01:44:16,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I've only had half a bottle, but I need to stop.

1505
01:44:16,596 --> 01:44:18,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to let my system process it.

1506
01:44:20,218 --> 01:44:20,378
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1507
01:44:20,945 --> 01:44:22,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, let's do listless.

1508
01:44:22,827 --> 01:44:23,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do listless?

1509
01:44:23,927 --> 01:44:24,348
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't.

1510
01:44:24,688 --> 01:44:25,989
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to find paper and pens, though.

1511
01:44:26,109 --> 01:44:28,171
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's do a quick break while we find paper and pens.

1512
01:44:28,911 --> 01:44:31,894
[SPEAKER_02]: We just break with a bunch of music, so I feel like we've got to talk about something.

1513
01:44:31,914 --> 01:44:32,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll find paper.

1514
01:44:32,674 --> 01:44:33,795
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to talk about something.

1515
01:44:35,356 --> 01:44:35,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Where?

1516
01:44:35,657 --> 01:44:35,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh!

1517
01:44:37,458 --> 01:44:37,658
[SPEAKER_28]: Yay!

1518
01:44:37,678 --> 01:44:37,738
[SPEAKER_28]: Woo!

1519
01:44:47,385 --> 01:44:50,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have anything interesting you'd like to share, Rice Princess?

1520
01:44:50,608 --> 01:44:50,888
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1521
01:44:51,248 --> 01:44:52,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I have something I do want to talk about.

1522
01:44:52,549 --> 01:44:55,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I haven't been to Scandia yet since they've done this.

1523
01:44:56,052 --> 01:44:59,675
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently, and I never knew this about 2DX machines.

1524
01:45:00,636 --> 01:45:02,297
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish Brad was here to hear it, but he's not.

1525
01:45:02,497 --> 01:45:02,878
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

1526
01:45:04,419 --> 01:45:09,623
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing about 2DX machines, I guess, is that they have like an S video output and a VGA output.

1527
01:45:10,604 --> 01:45:15,648
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the longest time at Scandia in Sacramento, where Orange Lounge is headquartered in Sacramento...

1528
01:45:16,095 --> 01:45:18,276
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been using S-Video and it's been kind of blurry.

1529
01:45:18,316 --> 01:45:19,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's been playable.

1530
01:45:19,176 --> 01:45:19,977
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been very playable.

1531
01:45:20,217 --> 01:45:21,157
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, a little bit blurry.

1532
01:45:21,177 --> 01:45:23,858
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get quite that crystal clearness that you get when you play it at home.

1533
01:45:24,298 --> 01:45:24,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

1534
01:45:24,999 --> 01:45:28,960
[SPEAKER_02]: But now they've switched over to VGA and I guess a lot of people really like the differences.

1535
01:45:29,060 --> 01:45:32,882
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I haven't seen the differences myself, but what do you guys think of it?

1536
01:45:33,482 --> 01:45:35,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the difference between S-Video and VGA?

1537
01:45:35,303 --> 01:45:39,725
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice to be able to see everything, like all the options you picked and stuff like that.

1538
01:45:39,765 --> 01:45:41,605
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like 717 and stuff like that.

1539
01:45:42,206 --> 01:45:44,666
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a bit bright for me.

1540
01:45:44,727 --> 01:45:45,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1541
01:45:45,107 --> 01:45:45,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'm just

1542
01:45:47,035 --> 01:45:50,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought maybe it was darker before, but it was just a little bit brighter for me.

1543
01:45:50,457 --> 01:45:54,038
[SPEAKER_06]: But otherwise, you know, it's kind of the same for me.

1544
01:45:54,279 --> 01:45:57,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I don't really notice that kind of stuff, you know, too much.

1545
01:45:58,901 --> 01:46:00,722
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes a difference when you're playing at higher speed.

1546
01:46:00,762 --> 01:46:02,623
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see your keys a lot clearly.

1547
01:46:03,143 --> 01:46:08,946
[SPEAKER_05]: The color needs a little bit... It's not like as bad as, say, like AI's machine was before, you know, with the discoloration.

1548
01:46:10,646 --> 01:46:11,787
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just slightly off.

1549
01:46:11,807 --> 01:46:13,748
[SPEAKER_05]: The contrast needs to be adjusted, but since the...

1550
01:46:14,497 --> 01:46:16,777
[SPEAKER_05]: The menus are all in Japanese, it might be a little bit hard to read.

1551
01:46:17,558 --> 01:46:22,019
[SPEAKER_03]: They changed over... Am I the only person who notices that it looks better?

1552
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:34,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I just... I'm sorry, I just came out of the bathroom, so I missed something, but it looks like everybody I've seen so far has said that it looks like crap, like it's been, like, really discolored and stuff.

1553
01:46:34,621 --> 01:46:36,382
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think before it was discolored.

1554
01:46:36,562 --> 01:46:43,423
[SPEAKER_21]: Now it looks clear, I can play almost anything on high speed 3 with, like, no problem, except, of course, like, Sakura and Max 300 and stuff.

1555
01:46:44,634 --> 01:46:45,554
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it looks way better.

1556
01:46:46,374 --> 01:46:49,295
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know, I may have some weird... Even on high speed it looks great.

1557
01:46:49,315 --> 01:46:53,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Lab during the last break.

1558
01:46:54,456 --> 01:46:55,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we already heard Lab.

1559
01:46:56,317 --> 01:46:57,337
[SPEAKER_02]: But Lab's good, so play it again.

1560
01:47:00,498 --> 01:47:00,658
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1561
01:47:02,698 --> 01:47:06,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Although the Act from 9th is pretty much just Lab.

1562
01:47:07,059 --> 01:47:09,840
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got like a, kind of a, well not a similar video...

1563
01:47:10,737 --> 01:47:12,518
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like an anime girl, like, running.

1564
01:47:12,959 --> 01:47:14,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a CG anime-ish girl.

1565
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:15,860
[SPEAKER_21]: It's pretty cool.

1566
01:47:16,681 --> 01:47:19,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I've already had to throw out two votes for Cage Match.

1567
01:47:19,063 --> 01:47:19,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool, huh?

1568
01:47:20,544 --> 01:47:21,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Any reason why?

1569
01:47:21,224 --> 01:47:23,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yes, they both voted for Rob's voice the game.

1570
01:47:25,907 --> 01:47:27,848
[SPEAKER_13]: My listeners are such retards.

1571
01:47:28,068 --> 01:47:29,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, was that my outside voice talking?

1572
01:47:29,870 --> 01:47:30,390
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

1573
01:47:31,191 --> 01:47:33,272
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we have some listeners who are some real retards.

1574
01:47:36,314 --> 01:47:36,934
[SPEAKER_05]: But we love you.

1575
01:47:38,348 --> 01:47:39,329
[SPEAKER_02]: We love you, but you lose.

1576
01:47:40,129 --> 01:47:40,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Rules are rules.

1577
01:47:41,149 --> 01:47:41,469
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

1578
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:43,050
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you like our retarded children.

1579
01:47:44,711 --> 01:47:45,992
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we have to love you.

1580
01:47:46,932 --> 01:47:48,072
[SPEAKER_03]: The state says we have to.

1581
01:47:48,092 --> 01:47:50,854
[SPEAKER_03]: We keep you in the attic.

1582
01:47:50,894 --> 01:47:52,655
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the special ones we keep in the attic.

1583
01:47:53,835 --> 01:47:54,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the basement.

1584
01:47:54,795 --> 01:47:56,336
[SPEAKER_05]: But we take them out of the basement when it rains.

1585
01:47:57,597 --> 01:48:00,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, if they get sick, then we have to start taking them to the doctor.

1586
01:48:01,218 --> 01:48:02,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, but they're saying something.

1587
01:48:02,359 --> 01:48:02,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

1588
01:48:04,730 --> 01:48:07,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that CDs are cool because you can see the spindle through them.

1589
01:48:08,613 --> 01:48:09,334
[SPEAKER_05]: All distorted-y.

1590
01:48:10,195 --> 01:48:10,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1591
01:48:11,416 --> 01:48:15,439
[SPEAKER_20]: Ah, retarded kids are already broke, so, I mean, we'll... You don't really have to take them anywhere.

1592
01:48:15,820 --> 01:48:17,141
[SPEAKER_20]: You can't really tell the difference, you know?

1593
01:48:19,303 --> 01:48:29,632
[SPEAKER_20]: Especially if you have, like, any blows to the head or anything, you know, and you think that they might give you damage and you're like, and you forgot, and you're like, oh, that's right, that was like that before you got hit in the head.

1594
01:48:31,488 --> 01:48:32,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the chatroom's getting defensive.

1595
01:48:34,089 --> 01:48:36,490
[SPEAKER_02]: So when did you guys start taking things we say seriously?

1596
01:48:36,911 --> 01:48:37,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, you guys.

1597
01:48:38,071 --> 01:48:38,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

1598
01:48:39,012 --> 01:48:39,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't take things seriously.

1599
01:48:39,912 --> 01:48:40,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the cow!

1600
01:48:40,512 --> 01:48:41,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the cow!

1601
01:48:41,433 --> 01:48:42,073
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, bark!

1602
01:48:42,393 --> 01:48:42,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Bark, bark!

1603
01:48:43,654 --> 01:48:44,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo!

1604
01:48:45,095 --> 01:48:46,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Bark, bark, cow!

1605
01:48:46,675 --> 01:48:46,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1606
01:48:47,016 --> 01:48:49,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the upstairs, uh... I think it's the upstairs neighbors.

1607
01:48:49,937 --> 01:48:52,518
[SPEAKER_21]: Our neighbors are pissed at us because we're making retarded jokes.

1608
01:48:52,538 --> 01:48:54,099
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't like those cage mat pics either.

1609
01:48:54,219 --> 01:48:55,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

1610
01:48:56,240 --> 01:48:56,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1611
01:48:56,620 --> 01:48:59,442
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, they've been, like, totally banging on the, like, ceiling.

1612
01:48:59,462 --> 01:49:00,142
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know, like...

1613
01:49:01,972 --> 01:49:10,436
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what they're doing upstairs, but... It's an older lady and her daughter.

1614
01:49:10,576 --> 01:49:12,117
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's her daughter.

1615
01:49:12,237 --> 01:49:16,059
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it's an older lady and her daughter.

1616
01:49:16,099 --> 01:49:16,759
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's their daughter.

1617
01:49:16,959 --> 01:49:19,440
[SPEAKER_20]: But, like, I hear banging on the walls all the time.

1618
01:49:20,681 --> 01:49:21,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1619
01:49:21,582 --> 01:49:23,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't it the one with the cat?

1620
01:49:23,182 --> 01:49:23,603
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that wasn't.

1621
01:49:23,623 --> 01:49:24,243
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the alien's.

1622
01:49:27,163 --> 01:49:39,410
[SPEAKER_05]: All I'm saying is they can go suck it because it's before 10 and, you know, yeah.

1623
01:49:39,670 --> 01:49:41,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, please, what?

1624
01:49:43,272 --> 01:49:48,935
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we were talking about, that was the one with the spheres, they take the energy out of their body.

1625
01:49:49,316 --> 01:49:52,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I haven't seen that movie in forever and I couldn't remember what that movie was, thank you.

1626
01:49:52,898 --> 01:49:55,119
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, this is a different movie with the mother and her son.

1627
01:49:55,939 --> 01:50:06,328
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were like fucking... And the cats could see... The cats could see that they were really alien or demon or something.

1628
01:50:06,628 --> 01:50:08,409
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the cats killed them at the end of the movie.

1629
01:50:09,831 --> 01:50:11,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, DarkTetsuya had a good idea.

1630
01:50:11,512 --> 01:50:11,872
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1631
01:50:11,932 --> 01:50:14,795
[SPEAKER_02]: He said that the upstairs folks might be playing World Class Track Meet.

1632
01:50:17,357 --> 01:50:18,378
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember on the Nintendo?

1633
01:50:18,458 --> 01:50:19,799
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they're playing Dance Aerobics.

1634
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:22,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Woot woot, DarkTetsuya.

1635
01:50:23,413 --> 01:50:24,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he gets an honorary zing for that.

1636
01:50:24,994 --> 01:50:25,895
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like a half zing.

1637
01:50:25,915 --> 01:50:30,598
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a z. He gets a coyote.

1638
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:34,081
[SPEAKER_02]: He gets a non-retard.

1639
01:50:35,502 --> 01:50:39,004
[SPEAKER_02]: He's our official non-retarded listener of the day.

1640
01:50:39,045 --> 01:50:40,706
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the special listener of the day now.

1641
01:50:43,528 --> 01:50:44,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy ferret to you.

1642
01:50:44,428 --> 01:50:46,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here to chew bubblegum and that's all.

1643
01:50:48,291 --> 01:50:49,512
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm all out of bubblegum.

1644
01:50:49,532 --> 01:50:51,213
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not doing anything.

1645
01:50:51,554 --> 01:50:51,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Goodbye.

1646
01:50:52,555 --> 01:51:00,118
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I will never forget in Nintendo Power when they had that segment on like the kids who were having the slumber party and playing the Power Pad game or whatever.

1647
01:51:00,358 --> 01:51:07,381
[SPEAKER_02]: They had like the red team and the yellow team and they were playing... Remember it was like this highlight on the Power Pad and kids having fun?

1648
01:51:07,601 --> 01:51:08,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I wasn't a dork.

1649
01:51:09,622 --> 01:51:10,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

1650
01:51:10,482 --> 01:51:12,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, surely somebody remembers that.

1651
01:51:12,563 --> 01:51:12,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Surely.

1652
01:51:12,963 --> 01:51:17,505
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember you telling me about submitting to be in some video game.

1653
01:51:18,145 --> 01:51:19,506
[SPEAKER_03]: You submitted... Shut up.

1654
01:51:20,046 --> 01:51:20,826
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a dork.

1655
01:51:21,827 --> 01:51:22,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude.

1656
01:51:23,752 --> 01:51:24,553
[SPEAKER_02]: You're such a dork.

1657
01:51:25,414 --> 01:51:25,694
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1658
01:51:25,754 --> 01:51:26,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish we could get a power pad.

1659
01:51:26,775 --> 01:51:27,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember Howard and Esther.

1660
01:51:27,996 --> 01:51:29,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a power pad, Jamie?

1661
01:51:29,497 --> 01:51:29,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I do.

1662
01:51:29,857 --> 01:51:34,381
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to bring that shit over and we should have a world-class track in the Orange Lounge one day.

1663
01:51:35,022 --> 01:51:35,202
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1664
01:51:36,143 --> 01:51:36,403
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

1665
01:51:36,663 --> 01:51:37,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll bring over the power glove.

1666
01:51:37,905 --> 01:51:38,465
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so bad.

1667
01:51:39,946 --> 01:51:41,608
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I remember Howard and Esther.

1668
01:51:41,928 --> 01:51:43,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I'll try to find it.

1669
01:51:43,509 --> 01:51:46,993
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an archive that has almost every Howard and Esther comic online.

1670
01:51:47,013 --> 01:51:48,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember seeing that somewhere.

1671
01:51:48,194 --> 01:51:49,635
[SPEAKER_02]: You pointed it to me before, I think.

1672
01:51:50,180 --> 01:51:51,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Long-ass time ago.

1673
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:52,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Long-ass time ago.

1674
01:51:52,221 --> 01:51:53,842
[SPEAKER_05]: But I remember the Mega Man ones.

1675
01:52:00,024 --> 01:52:10,389
[SPEAKER_21]: I like that Howard Nestor one, but I want to find somebody who has scans of all the Zelda comics that were in the Nintendo Power, because those were cool, and the Metroid ones, and the Star Fox ones, because they were all cool.

1676
01:52:10,749 --> 01:52:13,190
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I have an archive that has the Zelda ones.

1677
01:52:13,502 --> 01:52:16,224
[SPEAKER_02]: I still need to download episodes of the Zelda cartoon.

1678
01:52:16,264 --> 01:52:18,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, excuse me, princess.

1679
01:52:19,486 --> 01:52:23,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Before my computer died, I had the one where he was invisible.

1680
01:52:23,688 --> 01:52:27,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Where he stands up in the middle of Ganon's chamber and goes, Zelda loves me, Zelda loves me!

1681
01:52:27,471 --> 01:52:28,571
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they all get shot at.

1682
01:52:33,054 --> 01:52:33,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, quiet.

1683
01:52:35,075 --> 01:52:36,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, we're gossiping.

1684
01:52:37,917 --> 01:52:39,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, stop gossiping, dammit.

1685
01:52:40,258 --> 01:52:41,419
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about you, too.

1686
01:52:41,739 --> 01:52:42,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Bitch.

1687
01:52:42,079 --> 01:52:42,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Bitch.

1688
01:52:45,444 --> 01:52:45,644
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1689
01:52:45,684 --> 01:52:45,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1690
01:52:46,465 --> 01:52:46,685
[SPEAKER_02]: This?

1691
01:52:47,345 --> 01:52:47,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1692
01:52:48,046 --> 01:52:49,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I can, I suppose, if I have to.

1693
01:52:51,268 --> 01:52:51,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, a little bit.

1694
01:52:52,810 --> 01:52:53,790
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to be loud.

1695
01:52:54,731 --> 01:52:58,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we're going to take a break, and when we come back, we're going to have Liss Liss.

1696
01:52:59,775 --> 01:53:01,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know they had a monkeypox virus.

1697
01:53:01,856 --> 01:53:02,417
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.

1698
01:53:02,437 --> 01:53:04,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was reading about that on AOL.

1699
01:53:04,418 --> 01:53:09,462
[SPEAKER_05]: They showed a picture of a prairie dog on there, and the prairie dog looked like it was the prairie dog of Satan.

1700
01:53:09,562 --> 01:53:10,343
[SPEAKER_28]: You are monkeypox.

1701
01:53:11,018 --> 01:53:11,278
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1702
01:53:11,298 --> 01:53:12,979
[SPEAKER_05]: That's gonna be the new... It was making this face, Rob.

1703
01:53:13,019 --> 01:53:13,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1704
01:53:13,639 --> 01:53:14,439
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like... Sars?

1705
01:53:14,479 --> 01:53:16,300
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like... I have a prairie dog of Satan.

1706
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:23,862
[SPEAKER_20]: Move on over to Sars because for the second quarter of 2003, yes, monkeypox will be the official virus of Orange Lounge Radio.

1707
01:53:25,082 --> 01:53:26,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it replacing SARS?

1708
01:53:26,383 --> 01:53:26,843
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, it is.

1709
01:53:27,603 --> 01:53:27,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1710
01:53:27,803 --> 01:53:29,024
[SPEAKER_19]: It's monkeypox dense.

1711
01:53:29,684 --> 01:53:32,385
[SPEAKER_05]: So now... So now, Rob, do you have monkeypox?

1712
01:53:33,385 --> 01:53:34,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Monkeypox!

1713
01:53:34,805 --> 01:53:35,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Monkeypox!

1714
01:53:37,646 --> 01:53:39,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well then...

1715
01:53:40,689 --> 01:54:07,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess on that note, why don't we head off Hey look, it's Paul and Terry Alright, on that note, we're going to head off to break and when we come back we will announce this week's cage match winner so this is your last chance to submit a vote unless you've already been disqualified and when we come back, more show and list lists so we're going to take a chance to prepare our list lists for tonight so we'll be back and on that note

1716
01:55:02,092 --> 01:55:02,553

[SPEAKER_02]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

1723
02:01:18,067 --> 02:01:20,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1724
02:01:21,290 --> 02:01:24,754
[SPEAKER_02]: We are live, and I bet you're all dying to know who won tonight's cage match.

1725
02:01:26,735 --> 02:01:28,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here it is, kids.

[SPEAKER_13]: Wee!

1729
02:01:39,870 --> 02:01:44,532
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Fantastic Classic Machine with Disco at the end of the world.

1730
02:01:45,912 --> 02:01:46,172
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1731
02:01:46,412 --> 02:01:47,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes me want to shake my booty.

1732
02:01:48,253 --> 02:01:49,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Shake your booty.

1733
02:01:49,053 --> 02:01:49,574
[SPEAKER_02]: So there it is.

1734
02:01:50,834 --> 02:01:51,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for playing.

1735
02:01:54,856 --> 02:01:55,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha, no more Matrix!

1736
02:01:59,157 --> 02:02:02,079
[SPEAKER_20]: Ha, I didn't enter the Matrix into the frickin' contest.

1737
02:02:02,099 --> 02:02:04,179
[SPEAKER_20]: And ha, my song would have been gone this week anyways.

1738
02:02:04,700 --> 02:02:05,340
[SPEAKER_20]: So there.

1739
02:02:07,461 --> 02:02:08,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I have had a sniff.

1740
02:02:08,802 --> 02:02:09,202
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1741
02:02:10,442 --> 02:02:17,126
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we decided to do this segment, Brad went out to go run an errand, so we're going to hold off on list lists until the next segment.

1742
02:02:17,186 --> 02:02:19,727
[SPEAKER_02]: But guess what we have tonight, everybody?

1743
02:02:19,787 --> 02:02:20,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you ready, Irene?

1744
02:02:21,808 --> 02:02:22,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1745
02:02:22,728 --> 02:02:24,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you're going to have to be the timer since there's nobody else here.

1746
02:02:24,989 --> 02:02:25,890
[SPEAKER_02]: So you ready for this, too?

1747
02:02:26,610 --> 02:02:27,470
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be a timer.

1748
02:02:27,510 --> 02:02:28,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you time 30 seconds?

1749
02:02:30,952 --> 02:02:31,512
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, good.

1750
02:02:32,833 --> 02:02:33,433
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, hold on.

1751
02:02:33,453 --> 02:02:34,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to cue up the music here.

1752
02:02:39,210 --> 02:02:39,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

1753
02:02:40,090 --> 02:02:40,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1754
02:02:41,151 --> 02:02:43,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having a little problem finding the music.

1755
02:02:44,033 --> 02:02:44,293
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1756
02:02:44,333 --> 02:02:47,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to put all the theme songs in a separate folder.

1757
02:02:47,335 --> 02:02:52,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Because my drive, if you haven't already figured it out, is very dirty.

1758
02:02:53,220 --> 02:02:53,740
[SPEAKER_06]: You silly.

1759
02:02:53,980 --> 02:02:55,341
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to get dirty.

1760
02:02:55,441 --> 02:02:58,123
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to get a little... Oh my God, no.

1761
02:02:59,084 --> 02:02:59,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1762
02:02:59,804 --> 02:03:01,486
[SPEAKER_06]: One of you has to leave, right?

1763
02:03:02,486 --> 02:03:02,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1764
02:03:02,887 --> 02:03:05,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're not starting right now, but we have to have the theme songs.

1765
02:03:05,509 --> 02:03:05,989
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we go.

1766
02:03:09,753 --> 02:03:12,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it's time for Orange Crush.

1767
02:03:12,776 --> 02:03:14,117
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everybody's favorite segment.

1768
02:03:14,457 --> 02:03:15,658
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Orange Crush.

1769
02:03:16,159 --> 02:03:18,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows the most on Orange Crush?

1770
02:03:19,242 --> 02:03:22,124
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Rob vs. Jamie today on Orange Crush.

1771
02:03:22,204 --> 02:03:22,445
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

1772
02:03:23,586 --> 02:03:23,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1773
02:03:23,926 --> 02:03:26,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I leave or should Jamie leave?

1774
02:03:26,809 --> 02:03:27,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.

1775
02:03:27,389 --> 02:03:28,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go ahead and leave.

1776
02:03:28,070 --> 02:03:28,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoever wants to.

1777
02:03:28,830 --> 02:03:29,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll leave.

1778
02:03:30,256 --> 02:03:32,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait, you can't tell me tonight's Orange Car.

1779
02:03:32,558 --> 02:03:33,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I just have to go.

1780
02:03:33,379 --> 02:03:36,281
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to wait until you come back, you silly.

1781
02:03:36,581 --> 02:03:37,962
[SPEAKER_02]: This one doesn't go all the way back there.

1782
02:03:38,022 --> 02:03:38,863
[SPEAKER_06]: How about to me?

1783
02:03:39,343 --> 02:03:39,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1784
02:03:39,624 --> 02:03:41,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to me, and then I'll pass this one.

1785
02:03:41,925 --> 02:03:43,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, it works.

1786
02:03:43,387 --> 02:03:43,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1787
02:03:45,208 --> 02:03:45,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1788
02:03:47,069 --> 02:03:47,930
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll wait until you're done.

1789
02:03:50,953 --> 02:03:52,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, is he ready?

1790
02:03:53,395 --> 02:03:55,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, are you ready, Matt?

1791
02:03:55,256 --> 02:03:56,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Or just let me know.

1792
02:03:57,978 --> 02:03:58,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait, wait.

1793
02:03:58,459 --> 02:03:58,899
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no.

1794
02:03:59,700 --> 02:04:05,244
[SPEAKER_06]: The name of this one is called Destiny and it's questions about Politary.

1795
02:04:06,804 --> 02:04:07,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew it would be so funny.

1796
02:04:07,665 --> 02:04:08,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, tell me when you're ready, Matt.

1797
02:04:11,868 --> 02:04:14,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, where was she born and how old is she?

1798
02:04:14,669 --> 02:04:16,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Italy, 25.

1799
02:04:17,071 --> 02:04:19,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what is her mother's occupation?

1800
02:04:20,112 --> 02:04:20,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Opera singer.

1801
02:04:21,633 --> 02:04:24,035
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the name of her acid jazz band?

1802
02:04:25,095 --> 02:04:26,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Politary, blows me hard.

1803
02:04:27,617 --> 02:04:29,078
[SPEAKER_05]: What is her alter ego's name?

1804
02:04:30,606 --> 02:04:31,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Politary.

1805
02:04:32,387 --> 02:04:34,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did she live until she was 16?

1806
02:04:35,349 --> 02:04:35,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Italy.

1807
02:04:36,850 --> 02:04:37,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1808
02:04:38,931 --> 02:04:41,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I say how many you got right and wrong yet, or do I wait?

1809
02:04:41,533 --> 02:04:43,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

1810
02:04:43,654 --> 02:04:44,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Time's up.

1811
02:04:44,655 --> 02:04:46,156
[SPEAKER_06]: You only got one right.

1812
02:04:47,196 --> 02:04:48,517
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay!

1813
02:04:48,837 --> 02:04:52,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's not bad, considering most of the time people usually don't get a lot of them right.

1814
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:54,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's Rob's turn.

1815
02:04:54,681 --> 02:04:55,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I leave?

1816
02:04:55,722 --> 02:04:56,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1817
02:04:56,362 --> 02:04:56,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1818
02:04:56,662 --> 02:04:57,583
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to Rob's room.

1819
02:04:57,623 --> 02:04:58,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go to Beth's room.

1820
02:04:58,283 --> 02:04:58,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1821
02:04:58,423 --> 02:04:58,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1822
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:02,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I fear the room of Rob.

1823
02:05:02,681 --> 02:05:03,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah.

1824
02:05:04,721 --> 02:05:05,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Just don't go potty.

1825
02:05:10,583 --> 02:05:12,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hear anything of that at all, Rob?

1826
02:05:12,763 --> 02:05:12,923
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1827
02:05:13,523 --> 02:05:14,303
You're going to love this.

1828
02:05:14,403 --> 02:05:16,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, how did Jamie do?

1829
02:05:21,246 --> 02:05:21,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Ireland, and 27th.

1830
02:05:48,522 --> 02:05:50,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, what is her mother's occupation?

1831
02:05:50,503 --> 02:05:51,564
[SPEAKER_02]: No, she was born in Australia.

1832
02:05:51,924 --> 02:05:53,084
[SPEAKER_06]: What is her mother's occupation?

1833
02:05:55,806 --> 02:05:56,206
[SPEAKER_02]: A chef.

1834
02:05:57,387 --> 02:05:58,987
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the name of her acid jazz band?

1835
02:05:59,448 --> 02:05:59,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1836
02:06:00,288 --> 02:06:01,489
[SPEAKER_06]: What is her alter ego's name?

1837
02:06:03,830 --> 02:06:04,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Donna Summer.

1838
02:06:04,910 --> 02:06:06,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, where did she live until she was 16?

1839
02:06:07,792 --> 02:06:08,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia.

1840
02:06:09,433 --> 02:06:10,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, is that it?

1841
02:06:12,834 --> 02:06:13,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1842
02:06:13,094 --> 02:06:13,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1843
02:06:15,254 --> 02:06:19,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Since your first answer was incorrect, that one doesn't count, the first question.

1844
02:06:20,098 --> 02:06:20,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, come on.

1845
02:06:20,479 --> 02:06:24,342
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a two-part question, which means it counts for one point, so you get a half point.

1846
02:06:24,562 --> 02:06:25,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, goody.

1847
02:06:25,083 --> 02:06:25,523
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that?

1848
02:06:25,583 --> 02:06:26,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1849
02:06:27,104 --> 02:06:28,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have to get Jamie in here, too?

1850
02:06:28,466 --> 02:06:29,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Jamie can come out.

1851
02:06:29,907 --> 02:06:30,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1852
02:06:30,467 --> 02:06:31,688
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got a half a point.

1853
02:06:31,708 --> 02:06:34,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, I got a half point overall?

1854
02:06:34,571 --> 02:06:34,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1855
02:06:35,011 --> 02:06:35,692
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks.

1856
02:06:35,912 --> 02:06:36,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1857
02:06:36,432 --> 02:06:37,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like this game.

1858
02:06:38,754 --> 02:06:40,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like games where Jamie beats me.

1859
02:06:40,396 --> 02:06:42,718
[SPEAKER_06]: You're the only one who doesn't like it.

1860
02:06:43,524 --> 02:06:46,205
[SPEAKER_06]: We're like, Jamie, it's time to come out now.

1861
02:06:47,786 --> 02:06:48,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, is she up?

1862
02:06:49,187 --> 02:06:51,268
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think she's, you know.

1863
02:06:51,628 --> 02:06:51,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh.

1864
02:06:54,510 --> 02:06:55,170
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no, no.

1865
02:06:55,490 --> 02:06:57,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, should I just read the answer?

1866
02:06:57,531 --> 02:06:57,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1867
02:06:57,952 --> 02:06:58,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, why not?

1868
02:06:59,332 --> 02:07:02,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, the first question, how old is she and where was she born?

1869
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:04,032
[SPEAKER_05]: She's 27 years old.

1870
02:07:04,072 --> 02:07:04,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.

1871
02:07:05,153 --> 02:07:08,254
[SPEAKER_05]: And she was born in Australia, but you said... Come on.

1872
02:07:08,274 --> 02:07:10,075
[SPEAKER_06]: You said Ireland or something first.

1873
02:07:10,255 --> 02:07:11,115
[SPEAKER_06]: I changed it.

1874
02:07:11,636 --> 02:07:11,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Wham.

1875
02:07:11,796 --> 02:07:12,076
[SPEAKER_06]: It hit me.

1876
02:07:12,116 --> 02:07:12,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

1877
02:07:12,736 --> 02:07:13,596
[SPEAKER_06]: My clit hurts.

1878
02:07:13,636 --> 02:07:14,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the one... Okay, fine.

1879
02:07:14,697 --> 02:07:15,277
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make it one.

1880
02:07:15,297 --> 02:07:15,797
[SPEAKER_06]: You're still tied.

1881
02:07:15,837 --> 02:07:16,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Wham.

1882
02:07:16,137 --> 02:07:17,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the one she got right?

1883
02:07:17,718 --> 02:07:17,858
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1884
02:07:18,778 --> 02:07:20,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, did you hear that, Jamie?

1885
02:07:20,599 --> 02:07:24,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I threw a fit because I said Ireland at first for the first question, then I'm like, no way, Australia.

1886
02:07:24,941 --> 02:07:26,421
[SPEAKER_02]: So I made her give it to me.

1887
02:07:27,302 --> 02:07:27,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1888
02:07:28,470 --> 02:07:29,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I was... I did.

1889
02:07:29,931 --> 02:07:33,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, he got one point anyway, and you got one point, so you guys are tied anyway.

1890
02:07:33,852 --> 02:07:35,012
[SPEAKER_06]: He would have gotten a half point.

1891
02:07:35,032 --> 02:07:35,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I guessed 27.

1892
02:07:35,752 --> 02:07:36,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

1893
02:07:36,813 --> 02:07:37,313
[SPEAKER_02]: I guessed 27.

1894
02:07:37,413 --> 02:07:40,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, anyway, yeah, so she's 27 years old, and she's born in Australia.

1895
02:07:41,374 --> 02:07:44,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Her mother is an opera singer, a famous opera singer at that.

1896
02:07:45,496 --> 02:07:51,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and the acid jazz band she's a part of is called Cracker Jam, because she's white, I guess, I don't know.

1897
02:07:51,658 --> 02:07:55,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Her alter ego... Naoki, right?

1898
02:07:56,559 --> 02:07:57,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Close, but no, it's Sonya.

1899
02:07:58,601 --> 02:07:59,801
[SPEAKER_06]: That's her alter ego's name.

1900
02:08:00,922 --> 02:08:04,043
[SPEAKER_06]: And she lived... Oh, God.

1901
02:08:04,623 --> 02:08:07,104
[SPEAKER_06]: She lived in France until she was 16.

1902
02:08:07,624 --> 02:08:08,804
[SPEAKER_05]: No wonder she's so stupid.

1903
02:08:10,005 --> 02:08:10,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

1904
02:08:10,765 --> 02:08:12,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and other interesting facts.

1905
02:08:12,586 --> 02:08:13,126
[SPEAKER_06]: She's married.

1906
02:08:13,926 --> 02:08:15,027
[SPEAKER_06]: But she tells everyone she saw it.

1907
02:08:15,587 --> 02:08:17,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and she lives in Japan.

1908
02:08:18,388 --> 02:08:19,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that's it.

1909
02:08:19,308 --> 02:08:21,909
[SPEAKER_06]: That concludes another segment of Orange Crush.

1910
02:08:25,770 --> 02:08:27,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, I have to get back to the computer so I can...

1911
02:08:28,692 --> 02:08:30,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Officially close out this segment.

1912
02:08:34,596 --> 02:08:36,138
[SPEAKER_05]: God, that's like shitty radio, Rob.

1913
02:08:37,218 --> 02:08:39,920
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the end of Orange Crush.

1914
02:08:40,181 --> 02:08:43,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Politary really sucked on Orange Crush.

1915
02:08:43,843 --> 02:08:45,685
[SPEAKER_02]: One point for Rob.

1916
02:08:45,785 --> 02:08:46,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

1917
02:08:47,226 --> 02:08:50,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia was the answer, not that country with red hair.

1918
02:08:50,348 --> 02:08:50,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1919
02:08:53,070 --> 02:08:53,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1920
02:08:53,470 --> 02:08:55,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I said Italy.

1921
02:08:55,512 --> 02:08:56,292
[SPEAKER_05]: You said Italy.

1922
02:09:01,610 --> 02:09:06,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I technically got one right because I said not Politary for her alter ego.

1923
02:09:07,134 --> 02:09:07,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, true.

1924
02:09:08,515 --> 02:09:08,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

1925
02:09:08,955 --> 02:09:13,298
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you can get Australia, then I get not Politary.

1926
02:09:13,318 --> 02:09:14,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you get, you know what's your prize?

1927
02:09:14,518 --> 02:09:16,800
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to listen to Politary music all night long.

1928
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:18,861
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what you can do?

1929
02:09:19,622 --> 02:09:20,422
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what you can do?

1930
02:09:20,843 --> 02:09:21,103
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1931
02:09:21,443 --> 02:09:22,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Pick a key, please.

1932
02:09:23,584 --> 02:09:24,305
[SPEAKER_05]: And stay in it.

1933
02:09:31,494 --> 02:09:35,357
[SPEAKER_02]: YouSuck.com So did we learn something?

1934
02:09:35,397 --> 02:09:40,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat room, did we learn something from tonight's Orange Crush segment?

1935
02:09:40,681 --> 02:09:46,525
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's actually kind of neat because now we know who to hold for ransom if we ever want to have Paul Cherry never sing again.

1936
02:09:47,986 --> 02:09:48,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

1937
02:09:49,467 --> 02:09:49,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1938
02:09:49,867 --> 02:09:50,968
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that was cool.

1939
02:09:51,749 --> 02:09:53,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Orange Crush segment, Irene.

1940
02:09:53,710 --> 02:09:55,591
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you do your research for that?

1941
02:09:55,611 --> 02:09:56,532
[SPEAKER_05]: So that we know where to look.

1942
02:09:57,553 --> 02:09:59,214
[SPEAKER_02]: On a mic, on a mic, on a mic.

1943
02:10:03,288 --> 02:10:03,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Quiet.

1944
02:10:04,269 --> 02:10:04,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

1945
02:10:06,130 --> 02:10:07,991
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so, so quiet.

1946
02:10:10,832 --> 02:10:11,213
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1947
02:10:11,293 --> 02:10:14,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my Bjork tickets today, and I have to sell them.

1948
02:10:14,495 --> 02:10:14,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Why?

1949
02:10:15,195 --> 02:10:16,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm going to go to Cyber Beat Nation 2.

1950
02:10:17,436 --> 02:10:18,217
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go.

1951
02:10:19,117 --> 02:10:19,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's she playing?

1952
02:10:19,678 --> 02:10:20,478
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to go to Bjork?

1953
02:10:20,698 --> 02:10:21,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1954
02:10:21,399 --> 02:10:23,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you afford to pay me kickback some for the tickets?

1955
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:25,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm probably going to have to get the cost.

1956
02:10:25,481 --> 02:10:27,102
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred bucks for two.

1957
02:10:27,923 --> 02:10:28,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a lot.

1958
02:10:30,032 --> 02:10:34,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably going to put them on eBay if none of my friends take them just because I need to make my money back so I have money to spend in LA.

1959
02:10:34,975 --> 02:10:36,195
[SPEAKER_05]: When's the concert?

1960
02:10:36,295 --> 02:10:37,156
[SPEAKER_02]: It is August 8th.

1961
02:10:37,396 --> 02:10:38,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Where?

1962
02:10:38,697 --> 02:10:40,357
[SPEAKER_02]: At Pier 3032 in San Francisco.

1963
02:10:42,118 --> 02:10:42,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't go to that anyway.

1964
02:10:43,739 --> 02:10:44,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Classic Gaming Expo?

1965
02:10:44,940 --> 02:10:45,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

1966
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:47,001
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be at the Classic Gaming Expo.

1967
02:10:47,041 --> 02:10:48,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you already register for that?

1968
02:10:48,501 --> 02:10:48,741
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1969
02:10:49,222 --> 02:10:49,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1970
02:10:50,042 --> 02:10:50,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I should.

1971
02:10:50,702 --> 02:10:52,703
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to show up at the door and go, Hey!

1972
02:10:52,723 --> 02:10:55,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll talk to Xander about it.

1973
02:10:55,205 --> 02:10:55,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey!

1974
02:10:56,285 --> 02:10:57,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll talk to Xander about it because I can't go to Fonamay.

1975
02:11:01,364 --> 02:11:01,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

1976
02:11:02,485 --> 02:11:05,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's just because, you know, what's the point of going if I can't cosplay?

1977
02:11:09,770 --> 02:11:10,751
[SPEAKER_02]: What else was I going to say?

1978
02:11:10,951 --> 02:11:11,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

1979
02:11:13,513 --> 02:11:16,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Cyber Beat Nation 2, there's this little teaser.

1980
02:11:16,875 --> 02:11:18,196
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been teasing it online.

1981
02:11:18,216 --> 02:11:22,499
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a little teaser trailer that's out, and it's pretty cool.

1982
02:11:23,800 --> 02:11:27,762
[SPEAKER_02]: They hint at that there's going to be perfect attack singles and doubles this time around.

1983
02:11:27,802 --> 02:11:28,563
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be interesting.

1984
02:11:29,424 --> 02:11:35,048
[SPEAKER_02]: And Freestyle, if I read this teaser correctly, they're saying any Bomani song you want.

1985
02:11:36,048 --> 02:11:38,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes me think they're going to do Freestyle on a sim.

1986
02:11:38,570 --> 02:11:40,371
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just a guess, though.

1987
02:11:40,752 --> 02:11:42,092
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only way you could do it, right?

1988
02:11:42,613 --> 02:11:43,213
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll never happen.

1989
02:11:45,054 --> 02:11:45,555
[SPEAKER_19]: Why is that?

1990
02:11:46,655 --> 02:11:55,061
[SPEAKER_19]: Because they're too dumb to find actual sim files that are synced up correctly, and then you have people going, Watch as you get an email in a couple of weeks.

1991
02:11:56,062 --> 02:11:57,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, you're going to get an email.

1992
02:11:57,543 --> 02:11:58,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, help.

1993
02:11:58,950 --> 02:12:03,554
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually, what if people were responsible for making their own sim files and bringing them in?

1994
02:12:03,934 --> 02:12:05,435
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I would have meant.

1995
02:12:05,455 --> 02:12:06,115
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll happen.

1996
02:12:06,536 --> 02:12:07,316
[SPEAKER_20]: That'll be awful.

1997
02:12:08,657 --> 02:12:13,641
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're giving away another arcade machine, you can bet people will go to the distance to make it happen.

1998
02:12:13,801 --> 02:12:14,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it could be successful.

1999
02:12:15,122 --> 02:12:17,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, at Shaft we ended up using a sim.

2000
02:12:18,984 --> 02:12:21,086
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I'm cool and I'm the only one that can pull it off.

2001
02:12:22,487 --> 02:12:25,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Only one anywhere that can pull it off.

2002
02:12:26,972 --> 02:12:29,274
[SPEAKER_02]: No one will be able to do it, except for me.

2003
02:12:29,954 --> 02:12:31,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Me, me, me, me, me.

2004
02:12:33,777 --> 02:12:34,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really now?

2005
02:12:36,119 --> 02:12:36,479
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

2006
02:12:38,341 --> 02:12:45,846
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, segue into the sim section of... Okay, stuff that's going on.

2007
02:12:46,166 --> 02:12:51,310
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, first off, um, you've got a couple sites, um, you know, going through redesigns.

2008
02:12:51,330 --> 02:12:53,572
[SPEAKER_20]: You have Maniacs and stuff being the site, and it looks pretty.

2009
02:12:54,342 --> 02:12:58,967
[SPEAKER_20]: You've got Tourney Mix 4, which is ending their submissions in four days.

2010
02:12:59,407 --> 02:13:05,673
[SPEAKER_20]: So if you've registered already, which you must have if you're joining up, have your file done in four days.

2011
02:13:05,874 --> 02:13:09,117
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I need to get my file done in four days because it's not yet.

2012
02:13:10,098 --> 02:13:12,600
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, there's rumored to be about 400 entries.

2013
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:15,283
[SPEAKER_20]: They've got about 10 judges, so it looks pretty cool.

2014
02:13:15,303 --> 02:13:16,444
[SPEAKER_20]: They're going to be doing them.

2015
02:13:17,225 --> 02:13:25,150
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe releasing a group of files every week, and then voting on those, and then a new set will come up, and so on and so forth.

2016
02:13:27,331 --> 02:13:34,916
[SPEAKER_20]: Other than that, we've got... Let's see, a few fun sim files came out, like the terrible Mr. Grimshaw.

2017
02:13:35,876 --> 02:13:38,017
[SPEAKER_20]: Go check that one out, from Monty Sims.

2018
02:13:38,438 --> 02:13:38,978
[SPEAKER_20]: And, um...

2019
02:13:40,678 --> 02:13:44,181
[SPEAKER_20]: Really, um, oh, one more interesting bit of information.

2020
02:13:44,241 --> 02:13:47,303
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not really sim related, but it was on a sim site that I found it.

2021
02:13:47,984 --> 02:13:57,111
[SPEAKER_20]: DDRUK, there's this guy who goes by the name Havoc on there, and he, like I, just like me, he has copies of their arcade discs.

2022
02:13:57,151 --> 02:14:02,896
[SPEAKER_19]: But since, you know, you've got the UK arcade disc, he's got a Dancing Stage Euro Mix 2 disc.

2023
02:14:03,056 --> 02:14:08,120
[SPEAKER_20]: And what's funny is he found some songs on the disc that weren't in the actual game itself.

2024
02:14:08,846 --> 02:14:12,567
[SPEAKER_20]: And one of those songs would be from NSYNC, Bye Bye Bye.

2025
02:14:13,888 --> 02:14:34,214
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is an official Konami song that was supposed to be in Euromix 2, but never made it in, or it's an unlock that, you know, obviously, because the Euromix 2 site was never finished, so, you know, maybe they just never got around to releasing unlock codes for it, but he says that's not the only song that's hidden in there, too, so there's actually more than one song, so...

2026
02:14:35,563 --> 02:14:39,844
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, we're going to find out in a few weeks here that there's going to be more and more songs.

2027
02:14:40,084 --> 02:14:48,486
[SPEAKER_20]: And rumor that these songs, you know, for some reason didn't appear in Euromix 2, they might be in Euromix 3, or in fact, the licensing might have been cut on them.

2028
02:14:48,866 --> 02:14:53,586
[SPEAKER_20]: It's hard to say, but that is an official song that was supposed to be in Euromix 2, Bye Bye Bye.

2029
02:14:54,547 --> 02:14:55,987
[SPEAKER_20]: So, yeah.

2030
02:14:56,447 --> 02:14:58,127
Bye Bye Bye

2031
02:15:09,741 --> 02:15:10,221
[SPEAKER_05]: And they suck.

2032
02:15:14,084 --> 02:15:17,246
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I have to listen to people play The Light FM.

2033
02:15:17,607 --> 02:15:20,268
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I thought I got away from it when I lost my job.

2034
02:15:20,609 --> 02:15:22,290
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, people play it around me all the time now.

2035
02:15:23,591 --> 02:15:24,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what, though?

2036
02:15:24,371 --> 02:15:24,631
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

2037
02:15:25,032 --> 02:15:28,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I get them back by playing, um, I'm Gonna Make This CD Tonight Take to Work.

2038
02:15:29,075 --> 02:15:29,355
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh-huh.

2039
02:15:29,455 --> 02:15:30,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Of Hair Rock.

2040
02:15:30,716 --> 02:15:31,136
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.

2041
02:15:31,416 --> 02:15:33,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Poison, Motley Crue, Cuds and Roses.

2042
02:15:34,258 --> 02:15:35,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Walk this way!

2043
02:15:35,779 --> 02:15:36,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha ha ha.

2044
02:15:39,304 --> 02:15:39,984
[SPEAKER_05]: and Tesla.

2045
02:15:40,144 --> 02:15:41,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Walk this way!

2046
02:15:42,225 --> 02:15:43,545
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they have to put up with my trance.

2047
02:15:44,385 --> 02:15:48,386
[SPEAKER_05]: And everyone leaves the office when I'm working my overtime, so I turn up my trance CD.

2048
02:15:50,127 --> 02:15:53,687
[SPEAKER_02]: What a cool... We can't hear you, Irene.

2049
02:15:54,928 --> 02:15:59,269
[SPEAKER_06]: I play Orange Lounge all day, every day, because they let me listen to it and they don't care.

2050
02:16:00,109 --> 02:16:08,691
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny, because, you know, when you play, like, Highs Off You or, you know, any other song that says, like, fuck or shit, you know, like, somebody will be a faxing next to me and they'll say that and...

2051
02:16:11,730 --> 02:16:13,611
[SPEAKER_02]: He can't even understand it in Highest Off You.

2052
02:16:13,672 --> 02:16:15,332
[SPEAKER_02]: He can't understand the FU in that song.

2053
02:16:15,933 --> 02:16:18,134
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually a good segue, because I wanted to go back.

2054
02:16:18,154 --> 02:16:24,077
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys weren't paying attention because you were watching the Matrix thing, but Muheimer had a pretty interesting FU of the week, so I want to read this again.

2055
02:16:24,538 --> 02:16:28,020
[SPEAKER_02]: He said... Welcome back!

2056
02:16:28,180 --> 02:16:31,041
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I wanted to go back to Muheimer's Fuck You of the Week.

2057
02:16:31,361 --> 02:16:32,002
[SPEAKER_02]: This was interesting.

2058
02:16:32,042 --> 02:16:33,102
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, this was a part of it.

2059
02:16:33,142 --> 02:16:37,605
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, Fuck the six flags near me, because they had to get rid of their four extremes...

2060
02:16:37,987 --> 02:16:41,009
[SPEAKER_02]: because some bitch complained about the word bitch in it.

2061
02:16:43,271 --> 02:16:43,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

2062
02:16:43,471 --> 02:16:44,172
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think of that?

2063
02:16:44,813 --> 02:16:45,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Where?

2064
02:16:45,913 --> 02:16:46,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Bitch!

2065
02:16:48,075 --> 02:16:50,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoever took that out, you're a bitch.

2066
02:16:50,717 --> 02:16:54,180
[SPEAKER_21]: Bitches are everywhere, you can't get away from them, so just deal with it, okay?

2067
02:16:54,660 --> 02:16:56,982
[SPEAKER_21]: Just like retarded kids and faggots.

2068
02:16:59,464 --> 02:17:03,668
[SPEAKER_19]: The official term, or the technical term for them, are window lickers.

2069
02:17:09,787 --> 02:17:16,788
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd just like to say to that woman... Wait, it's somewhere in here.

2070
02:17:16,808 --> 02:17:21,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, hold on, hold on.

2071
02:17:23,049 --> 02:17:25,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, there you go.

2072
02:17:25,090 --> 02:17:26,930
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you do every time that song played on the radio?

2073
02:17:26,970 --> 02:17:29,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you call the station and complain and tell them to go off air?

2074
02:17:31,411 --> 02:17:36,532
[SPEAKER_20]: Once again, it's stupid parents trying to get other people to parent their kids for them.

2075
02:17:38,132 --> 02:17:41,654
[SPEAKER_20]: If your kids are listening, oh my god, they heard the word bitch.

2076
02:17:42,515 --> 02:17:44,536
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, oh my god, turn on the TV.

2077
02:17:45,117 --> 02:17:48,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what people's fascination is with curse words anyway?

2078
02:17:48,939 --> 02:17:50,481
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the fact that you tell them you can't do it.

2079
02:17:51,441 --> 02:17:54,603
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't like the word bitch, become Amish.

2080
02:17:55,124 --> 02:18:00,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Children would not be as apt to curse if you acted like it was no big thing.

2081
02:18:01,768 --> 02:18:05,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you don't let your kids watch TV because they say bitch on it all the time.

2082
02:18:11,828 --> 02:18:16,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone should read the first story in The Illustrated Man, which I'm reading right now.

2083
02:18:16,932 --> 02:18:21,895
[SPEAKER_06]: It talks about parenting and what happens when you don't parent your kids yourself.

2084
02:18:21,915 --> 02:18:24,837
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really bad, so yeah, you should read it.

2085
02:18:25,357 --> 02:18:31,482
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a question as to what song in DDR has bitch in it... Yes, Little Bitch.

2086
02:18:31,502 --> 02:18:35,504
[SPEAKER_13]: 1-2, Little Bitch.

2087
02:18:35,664 --> 02:18:36,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Is everybody...

2088
02:18:38,220 --> 02:19:03,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Blow Your Whistle, it says in the background, not an extreme, bitch, no that song is gone, but this is going to be interesting because the rumor is, and this is merely rumor at this point, but supposedly in that trailer for Max 2 USA, somebody caught a glimpse of the DJ Alligator Project video for Blow My Whistle, bitch, which is going to be interesting to see how the USA treats that.

2089
02:19:04,198 --> 02:19:10,700
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, here's the thing, though, is he actually officially has, it wasn't, you know, the fact that it was censored, there's two different songs.

2090
02:19:11,420 --> 02:19:15,721
[SPEAKER_20]: They're the same damn song, but it's Blowin' Whistle Bitch and Blowin' Whistle Baby, or The Whistle Song.

2091
02:19:16,681 --> 02:19:21,242
[SPEAKER_20]: See, so that's actually, you know, the official title is, you know, The Whistle Song.

2092
02:19:22,482 --> 02:19:24,363
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, that's over here.

2093
02:19:24,403 --> 02:19:25,483
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I call them both?

2094
02:19:26,203 --> 02:19:26,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Sucks!

2095
02:19:27,143 --> 02:19:33,645
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, here's the thing anyways, I mean, I'm sure they're gonna censor it, because if we have, like, you know, was it Gentle Stress, the AMD

2096
02:19:38,974 --> 02:19:47,562
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting yelled at because I played the 1-2 Little Bitch by Bus Stop and not the specials, which is the one that's actually in Xtreme.

2097
02:19:47,702 --> 02:19:49,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, get over it, my bad.

2098
02:19:49,584 --> 02:19:54,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, if you want to be technical, Little Bitch was in the first DDR.

2099
02:19:55,890 --> 02:20:00,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, and that's why it was brought back for Xtreme, because remember they brought back a bunch of old school DDR songs like Butterfly?

2100
02:20:01,455 --> 02:20:03,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, some guy wanted me to play Butterfly the other day.

2101
02:20:03,856 --> 02:20:04,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you do it?

2102
02:20:04,596 --> 02:20:04,796
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2103
02:20:05,136 --> 02:20:05,677
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd you tell him?

2104
02:20:06,037 --> 02:20:10,118

[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to be okay, Irene?

2150
02:27:16,707 --> 02:27:17,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you said you weren't ready yet.

2157
02:27:25,956 --> 02:27:27,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I should explain what list list is all about.

2158
02:27:27,417 --> 02:27:27,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to?

2159
02:27:27,757 --> 02:27:32,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want me to let... We all pick our top threes, and then we all vote one off, and then you vote.

2160
02:27:33,220 --> 02:27:33,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2161
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:38,222
[SPEAKER_02]: So the chat room has the final say, so you can vote.

2162
02:27:38,242 --> 02:27:40,063
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a scientific proven process.

2163
02:27:40,103 --> 02:27:41,504
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the top three of all time.

2164
02:27:41,564 --> 02:27:42,085
[SPEAKER_02]: No disputing.

2165
02:27:42,945 --> 02:27:44,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so, Jamie, you're number three.

2166
02:27:44,706 --> 02:27:45,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it, we're the experts.

2167
02:27:46,147 --> 02:27:48,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, my number three is Gravity.

2168
02:27:49,308 --> 02:27:49,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Gravity?

2169
02:27:51,229 --> 02:27:52,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a Loki remix?

2170
02:27:53,126 --> 02:27:54,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's a little bit too angry.

2171
02:27:54,387 --> 02:27:56,528
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like the S&M, you know.

2172
02:27:56,548 --> 02:28:01,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I say Gravity because if you think about it, it's like rhythmically good.

2173
02:28:01,570 --> 02:28:05,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Brad said Gravity, the anal burnination mix.

2174
02:28:06,872 --> 02:28:07,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, fine.

2175
02:28:07,492 --> 02:28:07,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go next.

2176
02:28:08,613 --> 02:28:13,615
[SPEAKER_02]: My number three pick, and this would be for like if you're having some fast, dirty, rotten sex, Max 300.

[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your number three pick.

2181
02:28:26,163 --> 02:28:31,605
[SPEAKER_20]: I was going to say probably we've got to go with Hot Limit because it's a longer song.

2182
02:28:31,925 --> 02:28:34,887
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, people like things that are longer.

2183
02:28:35,907 --> 02:28:37,188
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to make a comment.

2184
02:28:38,208 --> 02:28:38,808
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't work.

2185
02:28:39,929 --> 02:28:40,349
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't.

2186
02:28:41,589 --> 02:28:41,829
[SPEAKER_26]: What?

2187
02:28:42,770 --> 02:28:42,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

2188
02:28:42,910 --> 02:28:43,530
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't work.

2189
02:28:43,670 --> 02:28:44,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my.

2190
02:28:44,671 --> 02:28:45,151

02:29:29,925 --> 02:29:30,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

02:29:30,865 --> 02:29:31,525
[SPEAKER_05]: My number two?

2211
02:29:31,985 --> 02:29:32,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, your number two.

2212
02:29:33,046 --> 02:29:34,626
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from Solo, Let the Beat Hit Em.

02:29:35,147 --> 02:29:36,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the Beat Hit Em!

2214
02:29:38,548 --> 02:29:39,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, no, take that back.

2215
02:29:39,308 --> 02:29:41,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the version from Solo, the version from Max 2.

2216
02:29:41,889 --> 02:29:44,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so, uh, Let the Beat Hit Em R&B style.

2217
02:29:45,350 --> 02:29:45,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2218
02:29:46,450 --> 02:29:48,751
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like if you want, you know, the slow groove.

2219
02:29:52,222 --> 02:29:52,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

2220
02:29:53,243 --> 02:29:53,703
[SPEAKER_02]: My turn.

2221
02:29:54,103 --> 02:30:00,066
[SPEAKER_02]: My number two pick, and this is one that came to me during the break, but honestly, think about it, this song would be awesome.

2222
02:30:00,226 --> 02:30:01,506
[SPEAKER_02]: This song would be awesome to have sex to.

2223
02:30:01,867 --> 02:30:02,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Jam Jam Reggae.

2224
02:30:02,867 --> 02:30:06,629
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck are you smoking, man?

2225

[SPEAKER_02]: Instant Softie for me.

2226
02:30:10,191 --> 02:30:11,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's not going to do anything.

2227
02:30:12,692 --> 02:30:13,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't spell reggae.

2228
02:30:15,493 --> 02:30:16,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there you go.

2229
02:30:16,394 --> 02:30:17,774
[SPEAKER_02]: There's validity behind it.

2230
02:30:18,595 --> 02:30:19,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Just think about it.

2231
02:30:20,415 --> 02:30:20,756
[SPEAKER_02]: A.E.

2232
02:30:20,916 --> 02:30:21,376

[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm too white.

2235
02:30:25,596 --> 02:30:26,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm too white to spell.

2236
02:30:27,417 --> 02:30:30,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Just thinking, on the main goal, jam, jam, bring it over.

2237
02:30:30,879 --> 02:30:31,619
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway, come on.

[SPEAKER_20]: Matt.

2243
02:30:41,003 --> 02:30:45,025
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, just because it's got the, you know, background to go with it.

02:31:14,426 --> 02:31:14,806
[SPEAKER_02]: DXY.

2260
02:31:14,846 --> 02:31:16,247
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the perfect flow.

2261
02:31:16,768 --> 02:31:18,989
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's got the climax in there, and then the call, you know.

2262
02:31:19,070 --> 02:31:19,430
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, my.

2263
02:31:20,447 --> 02:31:24,150
[SPEAKER_02]: The flow, the climax, and the cigarette, it's all there.

2264
02:31:51,598 --> 02:31:59,100
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually does have the slow build-up, the, the, yay, you know, this is fun, and then the dying.

2265
02:32:01,841 --> 02:32:03,602
[SPEAKER_05]: That's if you're into asphyxiation.

2266
02:32:09,283 --> 02:32:09,584
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

2267
02:32:12,584 --> 02:32:14,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what, everybody, this just in.

2268
02:32:14,085 --> 02:32:16,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero's having an orange lounge party at his house in two weeks.

2269
02:32:16,966 --> 02:32:17,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

2270
02:32:18,026 --> 02:32:19,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Party, party.

2271
02:32:19,266 --> 02:32:20,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, read.

2272
02:32:20,607 --> 02:32:20,807
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2273
02:32:22,518 --> 02:32:26,061
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, Zero, just, uh, thought I'd remind you a little bit.

2274
02:32:26,902 --> 02:32:27,722
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, never mind.

2275
02:32:28,563 --> 02:32:29,003
[SPEAKER_20]: Continue.

2276
02:32:30,224 --> 02:32:31,765
[SPEAKER_02]: What, you thought two weeks was Fanime or something?

2277
02:32:32,766 --> 02:32:35,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what, I don't know what, uh... Exactly what I was thinking.

2278
02:32:38,010 --> 02:32:39,191
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, sorta is.

2279
02:32:39,751 --> 02:32:42,473
[SPEAKER_20]: In two weekends it'll be Fanime, I think.

2280
02:32:42,533 --> 02:32:44,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's keep going with the list list.

2281
02:32:44,815 --> 02:32:45,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to list list, thank you.

2282
02:32:46,516 --> 02:32:48,378
[SPEAKER_02]: My number one pick would be, of course...

2283
02:32:48,940 --> 02:32:52,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this is obvious, I'm sorry, I am going with the obvious, because it's true, do it all night.

2284
02:32:57,865 --> 02:33:02,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, fine, well then fine, let's hear your number one obvious picks.

2285
02:33:03,188 --> 02:33:09,932
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, mine is going to be Wild Rush, because it starts off slow and it gets faster as it goes along.

2286
02:33:12,153 --> 02:33:14,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the Wild Rush remix is pretty hot.

2287
02:33:16,655 --> 02:33:16,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2288
02:33:17,136 --> 02:33:17,516
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah!

2289
02:33:17,556 --> 02:33:17,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah!

2290
02:33:19,804 --> 02:33:23,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Rice Princess, your number one pick.

2291
02:33:24,065 --> 02:33:26,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Is no one going to say one of the other obvious songs?

2292
02:33:26,766 --> 02:33:29,427
[SPEAKER_02]: It's down to you and Brad, so you better figure out.

2293
02:33:29,927 --> 02:33:31,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I give an honorable mention?

2294
02:33:32,928 --> 02:33:33,388
[SPEAKER_02]: No, say what?

2295
02:33:33,648 --> 02:33:34,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

2296
02:33:34,209 --> 02:33:34,689
[SPEAKER_02]: After we're done.

2297
02:33:35,229 --> 02:33:36,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, my number one's Afranova.

2298
02:33:38,650 --> 02:33:40,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't ask, I don't know.

2299
02:33:40,150 --> 02:33:40,971
[SPEAKER_21]: Afranova.

2300
02:33:40,991 --> 02:33:45,152
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess everybody was being nice to me, so they can give me the real obvious one.

2301
02:33:45,332 --> 02:33:45,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2302
02:33:45,892 --> 02:33:47,593
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, my number one choice.

2303
02:33:48,293 --> 02:33:48,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Trumbo, please.

2304
02:33:49,389 --> 02:33:49,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2305
02:33:49,829 --> 02:33:50,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Flash.

2306
02:33:52,090 --> 02:33:52,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Please don't.

2307
02:33:53,231 --> 02:33:54,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2308
02:33:54,111 --> 02:33:54,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2309
02:33:54,491 --> 02:33:54,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Insertion.

2310
02:33:55,251 --> 02:33:56,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Insertion, thank you.

2311
02:33:57,772 --> 02:33:58,113
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2312
02:34:00,193 --> 02:34:01,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now we're going to the honorable mentions.

2313
02:34:01,954 --> 02:34:03,395
[SPEAKER_02]: No one said the whistle song.

2314
02:34:03,455 --> 02:34:04,615
[SPEAKER_02]: No one said After the Game of Love.

2315
02:34:04,635 --> 02:34:05,095
[SPEAKER_02]: After the Game of Love.

2316
02:34:05,115 --> 02:34:05,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Because those suck.

2317
02:34:06,016 --> 02:34:07,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Temple of Love.

2318
02:34:07,456 --> 02:34:08,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Temple of Love.

2319
02:34:08,597 --> 02:34:10,057
[SPEAKER_02]: No Greco-Bulman style.

2320
02:34:12,578 --> 02:34:13,919
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so here is the list.

2321
02:34:15,512 --> 02:34:16,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you never been mellow?

2322
02:34:17,594 --> 02:34:19,896
[SPEAKER_21]: Here's some of the bullshit lists I had before we go on.

2323
02:34:20,196 --> 02:34:33,487
[SPEAKER_21]: Dead End, Healing Vision Angelic Mix, Hypnotic Crisis, Paranoia Dirty Mix, in case you're paranoid, you're jealous, and Crash, of course.

2324
02:34:34,889 --> 02:34:37,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, one of the other ones I was going to say was Paranoia Clean.

2325
02:34:38,752 --> 02:34:40,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially the pounding one.

2326
02:34:41,795 --> 02:34:43,296
[SPEAKER_28]: Or I was going to say Hellscaper.

2327
02:34:43,752 --> 02:34:44,612
[SPEAKER_28]: or maybe Crimson.

2328
02:34:44,652 --> 02:34:45,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Pat Center.

2329
02:34:48,814 --> 02:34:49,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

2330
02:34:49,494 --> 02:34:50,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Some suggestions from the chat room.

2331
02:34:51,535 --> 02:34:53,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Some suggestions from the chat room as well.

2332
02:34:53,116 --> 02:34:56,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Gimme, gimme, gimme.

2333
02:34:56,898 --> 02:34:57,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

2334
02:34:58,238 --> 02:34:59,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I think V is good.

2335
02:34:59,799 --> 02:35:02,200
[SPEAKER_02]: V. Oh, Nick, please not so quick.

2336
02:35:02,800 --> 02:35:03,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than Erotic.

2337
02:35:03,620 --> 02:35:10,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom Boom Dollar, W Dub, So Many Men, It's Raining Men, Test My Best, Cowgirl.

2338
02:35:10,323 --> 02:35:12,104
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard the full version of So Many Men.

2339
02:35:12,884 --> 02:35:14,445
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like she's an utter slut.

2340
02:35:16,146 --> 02:35:24,091
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, I would have picked this song had it been, you know, in the actual game and not just part of the megamix, the Paranoia Evolution.

2341
02:35:24,331 --> 02:35:28,453
[SPEAKER_20]: It's kind of like a trip-hop version of it.

2342
02:35:40,908 --> 02:35:45,190
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, and of course, shame on all of us for forgetting this one, Be In My Paradise.

2343
02:35:46,231 --> 02:35:46,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, no.

2344
02:35:48,412 --> 02:35:52,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Be In My Paradise, Rob, makes me break out in hives.

2345
02:35:53,494 --> 02:35:54,315
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really nasty.

2346
02:35:55,095 --> 02:35:55,415
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright.

2347
02:35:57,656 --> 02:36:00,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's, uh... Or this is like, like, um, right now.

2348
02:36:02,038 --> 02:36:03,179
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, guess what?

2349
02:36:03,199 --> 02:36:04,159
[SPEAKER_29]: Come on, baby, do it.

2350
02:36:04,179 --> 02:36:07,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I was looking in an old issue of People Magazine, because I leave those at my work sometimes.

2351
02:36:07,761 --> 02:36:09,282
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a review for Atomic Kitten in there.

2352
02:36:09,831 --> 02:36:12,013
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw an Atomic Kitten video at Faces one night.

2353
02:36:12,033 --> 02:36:12,613
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cool.

2354
02:36:13,474 --> 02:36:13,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you were there.

2355
02:36:14,075 --> 02:36:14,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

2356
02:36:15,055 --> 02:36:16,657
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so now... But they said that they suck.

2357
02:36:17,337 --> 02:36:29,087
[SPEAKER_21]: A little advice, if any of you guys want to, you know, get the ladies in the mood, any Thomas Howard song or... Jeff Coot, any Jeff Coot song.

2358
02:36:29,847 --> 02:36:30,748
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, ladies will love you.

2359
02:36:35,011 --> 02:36:37,013
[SPEAKER_21]: Ladies love Thomas Howard, trust me.

2360
02:36:37,593 --> 02:36:38,154
[SPEAKER_21]: Even though he's gay.

2361
02:36:40,273 --> 02:36:40,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Tack.

2362
02:36:40,853 --> 02:36:41,214
[SPEAKER_02]: All tack.

2363
02:36:41,714 --> 02:36:42,234
[SPEAKER_02]: All the time.

2364
02:36:42,334 --> 02:36:44,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get to the elimination part, please.

2365
02:36:44,396 --> 02:36:45,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the list so far.

2366
02:36:45,556 --> 02:36:58,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Gravity, Max 300, Hot Limit, Ecstasy, In the Heat of the Night, Let the Beat Hit Em R&B, Jam Jam Reggae, Sexy Planet, Love Machine, DXY, Sync, Do It All Night, Wild Rush, Afronova, and Insertion.

2367
02:36:58,824 --> 02:37:00,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, what's coming off the list?

2368
02:37:00,846 --> 02:37:01,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Jam Jam Ragu.

2369
02:37:02,667 --> 02:37:03,527
[SPEAKER_02]: You stink.

2370
02:37:05,228 --> 02:37:06,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Jam Jam Ray is the best.

2371
02:37:06,849 --> 02:37:07,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, you guys.

2372
02:37:07,710 --> 02:37:08,671
[SPEAKER_02]: You stink.

2373
02:37:08,691 --> 02:37:09,251
[SPEAKER_02]: You stink.

2374
02:37:11,135 --> 02:37:16,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine, I'm going to take off... I don't care.

2375
02:37:16,438 --> 02:37:32,950
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take off... I'm just kind of drawn to the... well... I don't know why... All these songs are pretty good, but I just... I don't see gravity so much, so I'm going to take off gravity.

2376
02:37:33,030 --> 02:37:33,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen to it.

2377
02:37:34,931 --> 02:37:39,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I think of stoic, not gravity, so I think it goes back to that whole stoic versus gravity thing.

2378
02:37:40,422 --> 02:37:41,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no, because Matt's next.

2379
02:37:41,623 --> 02:37:41,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt.

2380
02:37:44,525 --> 02:37:49,109
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't care, but, um... Jack does not make good sex music.

2381
02:37:49,129 --> 02:37:49,650
[SPEAKER_20]: Sink, bye-bye.

2382
02:37:52,132 --> 02:37:53,152
[SPEAKER_05]: You are so full of shit.

2383
02:37:54,473 --> 02:37:55,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Outphase, anyway.

2384
02:37:55,594 --> 02:37:57,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

2385
02:37:57,976 --> 02:37:58,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Irene.

2386
02:38:00,158 --> 02:38:01,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna take off Hot Limit, because it's stupid.

2387
02:38:02,560 --> 02:38:03,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2388
02:38:06,403 --> 02:38:07,564
[SPEAKER_21]: Dude, take Tylenol.

2389
02:38:08,703 --> 02:38:09,484
[SPEAKER_21]: Raging Ritalin.

2390
02:38:09,944 --> 02:38:12,526
[SPEAKER_21]: Um... Man, this is hard.

2391
02:38:12,866 --> 02:38:16,148
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't... I should've said Love Me Do, that would've been a good one.

2392
02:38:16,989 --> 02:38:17,249
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

2393
02:38:18,750 --> 02:38:20,571
[SPEAKER_21]: Um... Yeah, whatever.

2394
02:38:20,831 --> 02:38:24,254
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I'll say... Shit.

2395
02:38:26,455 --> 02:38:32,879
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, I'm gonna have to go with... Let the beat hit him RB5.

2396
02:38:33,100 --> 02:38:34,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, vote all nine off, thank you.

2397
02:38:34,761 --> 02:38:35,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Did all yours get voted off?

2398
02:38:35,921 --> 02:38:36,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes!

2399
02:38:36,442 --> 02:38:38,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry, I didn't notice that.

2400
02:38:41,147 --> 02:38:43,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess Jamie's are all gone, I'm sorry.

2401
02:38:45,809 --> 02:38:46,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2402
02:38:51,931 --> 02:38:52,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2403
02:38:54,192 --> 02:38:54,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the list.

2404
02:38:55,772 --> 02:38:58,013
[SPEAKER_02]: And you folks can vote on it right now in the chatroom.

2405
02:39:00,674 --> 02:39:00,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Max 300.

2406
02:39:01,395 --> 02:39:02,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Ecstasy.

2407
02:39:03,555 --> 02:39:04,976
[SPEAKER_02]: And I spelled it wrong, I'm sorry.

2408
02:39:05,822 --> 02:39:08,604
[SPEAKER_02]: In the heat of the night, actually, why didn't it come up in my spell check then?

2409
02:39:08,624 --> 02:39:09,005
[SPEAKER_02]: That's weird.

2410
02:39:10,886 --> 02:39:11,427
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess so.

2411
02:39:12,227 --> 02:39:22,456
[SPEAKER_02]: In the heat of the night, Sexy Planet, Love Machine, DXY, Do It All Night, Wild Rush, Afranova, and Insertion.

2412
02:39:23,096 --> 02:39:26,019
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you can send those votes to me.

2413
02:39:26,839 --> 02:39:29,081
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Sky, and I'm in the chat room right now.

2414
02:39:29,121 --> 02:39:29,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

2415
02:39:29,902 --> 02:39:33,845
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can send your pics to me over private message, because you love me.

2416
02:39:35,874 --> 02:39:46,922
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, a quick break featuring, um, some more Guitar Freak songs.

2417
02:39:47,042 --> 02:39:52,346
[SPEAKER_02]: How about, I'm just going to pick random ones from this little CD that Jamie gave me.

2418
02:39:52,886 --> 02:39:54,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Monkey Magic, that's always a fun one.

2419
02:39:55,588 --> 02:39:58,430
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I like monkey.

2420
02:39:59,271 --> 02:40:04,755
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, Sweet Feline, or did we, no, we already did that one, didn't we?

2421
02:40:07,096 --> 02:40:07,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I did that one.

2422
02:40:08,277 --> 02:40:08,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2423
02:40:08,757 --> 02:40:10,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to pick another one.

2424
02:40:10,538 --> 02:40:12,519
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Star of Muse?

2425
02:40:12,679 --> 02:40:13,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that will be fun.

2426
02:40:13,960 --> 02:40:16,241
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's all the time you've got to send in your votes.

2427
02:40:16,741 --> 02:40:19,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll be back to wrap up the big, fat, hairy, scary show.

2428
02:40:21,384 --> 02:40:21,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned.

2429
02:40:22,084 --> 02:40:22,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Loki?

2430
02:40:25,166 --> 02:40:29,688
[SPEAKER_20]: Real quickly, because I know I forgot to mention it, but it is big news in case if no one's been reading.

2431
02:40:32,190 --> 02:40:33,911
[SPEAKER_20]: It sort of ties in with the stuff.

2432
02:40:34,151 --> 02:40:34,371
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway...

2433
02:40:34,997 --> 02:40:42,104
[SPEAKER_20]: The edit code for the DDR Extreme machine has been found, and now we can make DDR Extreme edits and have started to do so.

2434
02:40:43,946 --> 02:40:44,486
[SPEAKER_19]: So, yay.

2435
02:40:44,907 --> 02:40:45,327
[SPEAKER_19]: Rejoice.

2436
02:40:47,469 --> 02:40:48,490
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, we'll be back.

2437
02:41:07,183 --> 02:41:08,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

2438
02:41:36,424 --> 02:41:37,326
Thanks for watching!

2439
02:41:55,578 --> 02:41:56,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

2440
02:42:12,385 --> 02:42:13,866
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

2441
02:46:16,227 --> 02:46:17,747
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello everybody!

2442
02:46:20,048 --> 02:46:20,608
[SPEAKER_28]: So what's going on?

2443
02:46:20,628 --> 02:46:21,629
[SPEAKER_28]: I wasn't paying attention.

2444
02:46:22,149 --> 02:46:26,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think we have to do the, um, the winner or something.

2445
02:46:26,810 --> 02:46:27,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2446
02:46:27,370 --> 02:46:28,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Supposed to be announcing the winner for something?

2447
02:46:30,137 --> 02:46:32,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but Rob's occupied.

2448
02:46:32,479 --> 02:46:33,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, why is it?

2449
02:46:33,820 --> 02:46:34,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know this.

2450
02:46:34,640 --> 02:46:35,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it?

2451
02:46:36,422 --> 02:46:42,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, seriously, when we went on air, did or did not, the house line rang and my cell phone went off right when we went on air.

2452
02:46:42,586 --> 02:46:43,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Then why not turn them off?

2453
02:46:44,167 --> 02:46:44,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to.

2454
02:46:46,648 --> 02:46:47,889
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember who it was.

2455
02:46:48,330 --> 02:46:48,530
[SPEAKER_02]: It was...

2456
02:46:49,719 --> 02:46:50,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Who was it?

2457
02:46:50,279 --> 02:46:50,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2458
02:46:50,620 --> 02:46:54,743
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when I used to come for my visitations to Undersedation, I would turn off my cell phone.

2459
02:46:54,943 --> 02:46:58,706
[SPEAKER_02]: My cell phone wouldn't even work in there, and it hasn't been... That should have been my FU of the week.

2460
02:46:58,786 --> 02:47:04,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, my cell phone has not been working in the house even recently, so I'm surprised it even went off at all.

2461
02:47:04,670 --> 02:47:05,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Who was it that called?

2462
02:47:05,651 --> 02:47:06,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember.

2463
02:47:06,371 --> 02:47:07,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess... whatever.

2464
02:47:08,733 --> 02:47:14,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so... Let's see.

2465
02:47:14,577 --> 02:47:15,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, the list list.

2466
02:47:15,538 --> 02:47:16,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.

2467
02:47:16,078 --> 02:47:17,579
[SPEAKER_02]: The top three songs to...

2468
02:47:19,423 --> 02:47:23,266
[SPEAKER_02]: HaveSexor2, GetDirtyAndNaughty2 Third place!

2469
02:47:24,527 --> 02:47:25,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Drumroll please.

2470
02:47:26,809 --> 02:47:27,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.

2471
02:47:27,589 --> 02:47:28,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Ecstasy.

2472
02:47:29,531 --> 02:47:30,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

2473
02:47:30,992 --> 02:47:31,652
[SPEAKER_02]: That was number three.

2474
02:47:32,413 --> 02:47:32,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Ecstasy.

2475
02:47:33,354 --> 02:47:33,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

2476
02:47:35,916 --> 02:47:36,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Second place.

2477
02:47:37,737 --> 02:47:40,799
[SPEAKER_02]: The winner is... DXY!

2478
02:47:41,320 --> 02:47:42,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

2479
02:47:43,421 --> 02:47:44,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, second is DXY.

2480
02:47:45,523 --> 02:47:48,145
[SPEAKER_02]: And in first place, ByALandslide.

2481
02:47:49,292 --> 02:47:49,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Insertion.

2482
02:47:51,453 --> 02:47:51,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

2483
02:47:52,973 --> 02:47:56,714
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

2484
02:47:57,274 --> 02:47:57,934
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that.

2485
02:47:58,655 --> 02:47:59,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Listless.

2486
02:47:59,115 --> 02:48:00,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you guys enjoyed.

2487
02:48:00,415 --> 02:48:03,096
[SPEAKER_02]: And an honorary vote for Sky's Voice the Game.

2488
02:48:03,156 --> 02:48:03,916
[SPEAKER_02]: You suck.

2489
02:48:04,176 --> 02:48:04,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

2490
02:48:09,478 --> 02:48:11,438
[SPEAKER_20]: And now with some show news.

2491
02:48:12,759 --> 02:48:14,839
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we'll be able to do phones next week.

2492
02:48:15,659 --> 02:48:16,820
[SPEAKER_20]: And I figured out a way to do it.

2493
02:48:17,820 --> 02:48:17,960
[SPEAKER_20]: So.

2494
02:48:18,550 --> 02:48:26,512
[SPEAKER_20]: If you're interested in being able to do this next week, we're going to be using a program probably called PhoneFree.

2495
02:48:27,392 --> 02:48:30,693
[SPEAKER_20]: And I will post a link in the chat room where you can find this program.

2496
02:48:30,993 --> 02:48:32,193
[SPEAKER_20]: And just basically sign up.

2497
02:48:32,313 --> 02:48:34,033
[SPEAKER_20]: It's totally free.

2498
02:48:34,773 --> 02:48:39,154
[SPEAKER_20]: And what you're going to want to do is I'll also give you guys an ID number, which will be our phone number.

2499
02:48:40,315 --> 02:48:43,875
[SPEAKER_20]: And so during the show, we'll have this hopefully available live.

2500
02:48:44,416 --> 02:48:46,396
[SPEAKER_20]: And I should be able to answer, well...

2501
02:48:46,823 --> 02:48:56,672
[SPEAKER_20]: PC phone calls, you know, it's not really using your actual phone line, phone line, it's just like, you know, almost like voice chatting over like Yahoo Instant Messenger or something like that, so maybe we're going to try that.

2502
02:48:57,252 --> 02:48:58,814
[SPEAKER_20]: But anyways, I'll post links, so.

2503
02:49:00,555 --> 02:49:05,760
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll probably test it out during a fuck-off show sometime in the next week, like before the weekend, I don't know.

2504
02:49:06,420 --> 02:49:07,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you planning on doing any fuck-off shows this week, Jamie?

2505
02:49:08,062 --> 02:49:09,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you were thinking about, yeah.

2506
02:49:10,023 --> 02:49:12,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I sort of preempted the rewind Monday.

2507
02:49:12,946 --> 02:49:13,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2508
02:49:13,844 --> 02:49:14,285
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.

2509
02:49:14,545 --> 02:49:14,925
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2510
02:49:15,166 --> 02:49:18,949
[SPEAKER_02]: The way I think about it, the fuck-offs get more listeners than the rewinds anyway, so it's all good.

2511
02:49:19,689 --> 02:49:23,393
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think, you know, for me it's easier just to come home and do it on Monday.

2512
02:49:23,413 --> 02:49:25,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm sort of angsty anyway.

2513
02:49:25,515 --> 02:49:26,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to move the rewind?

2514
02:49:27,216 --> 02:49:27,917
[SPEAKER_02]: We can always move the rewind.

2515
02:49:27,937 --> 02:49:29,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care about when we do the rewind.

2516
02:49:29,858 --> 02:49:31,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we can talk... Let's go to the chat room.

2517
02:49:31,820 --> 02:49:34,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat room, go on the live journal community.

2518
02:49:34,282 --> 02:49:35,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I was going to say, there you go, there you go.

2519
02:49:35,924 --> 02:49:36,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent idea.

2520
02:49:36,504 --> 02:49:38,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Puppy, start a thread on the live journal community.

2521
02:49:39,102 --> 02:49:46,225
[SPEAKER_05]: and everyone let us know if you would leave the Rewind on Monday or just keep the Thursday one the way it is or whatever.

2522
02:49:46,385 --> 02:49:48,766
[SPEAKER_02]: We can always move the Monday Rewind to Tuesday as well.

2523
02:49:48,786 --> 02:49:50,066
[SPEAKER_05]: We could just do both of them on Thursday.

2524
02:49:50,906 --> 02:49:51,947
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a possibility too.

2525
02:49:52,047 --> 02:49:52,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Run them back to back to back.

2526
02:49:53,687 --> 02:49:54,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Wednesday or whatever.

2527
02:49:55,268 --> 02:49:56,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Saturday afternoon or something.

2528
02:49:56,528 --> 02:49:59,309
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we cannot do it on Saturday afternoon.

2529
02:50:00,270 --> 02:50:01,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that when Understation Live is up?

2530
02:50:01,750 --> 02:50:03,431
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to encourage people to listen to Understation Live.

2531
02:50:03,471 --> 02:50:04,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I didn't realize they were on.

2532
02:50:04,571 --> 02:50:05,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they moved to Friday.

2533
02:50:05,472 --> 02:50:06,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought they were still doing it on Saturday.

2534
02:50:07,318 --> 02:50:08,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they moved to Friday.

2535
02:50:08,158 --> 02:50:08,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll check.

2536
02:50:08,758 --> 02:50:09,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll check.

2537
02:50:09,119 --> 02:50:09,499
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're right.

2538
02:50:09,519 --> 02:50:10,859
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to interfere with Understation Live.

2539
02:50:10,879 --> 02:50:12,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we love them.

2540
02:50:12,660 --> 02:50:13,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll check and make sure.

2541
02:50:13,900 --> 02:50:14,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they moved to Friday.

2542
02:50:14,900 --> 02:50:15,200
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

2543
02:50:16,701 --> 02:50:17,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2544
02:50:18,421 --> 02:50:22,403
[SPEAKER_02]: In other show news, Arcadian reminded me of this.

2545
02:50:22,443 --> 02:50:23,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcadian42, thank you.

2546
02:50:23,763 --> 02:50:24,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to point this out.

2547
02:50:24,763 --> 02:50:29,225
[SPEAKER_02]: But everybody, look at the person next to you and give them a big pat on the back.

2548
02:50:30,185 --> 02:50:31,225
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see some pats on the back.

2549
02:50:32,126 --> 02:50:33,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, pat people on the back because...

2550
02:50:34,403 --> 02:50:38,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, this week, Orange Lounge Radio crossed 2,500 total listening hours.

2551
02:50:39,204 --> 02:50:40,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

2552
02:50:40,984 --> 02:50:42,765
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the highest we've ever been.

2553
02:50:43,125 --> 02:50:43,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

2554
02:50:43,645 --> 02:50:44,245
[SPEAKER_06]: We're high.

2555
02:50:44,485 --> 02:50:47,086
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because of a lot of hard work from a lot of people.

2556
02:50:47,426 --> 02:50:50,346
[SPEAKER_02]: And some events that happened this month certainly helped.

2557
02:50:50,767 --> 02:50:55,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we were a Bomani-style side of the week for a while, which really helped the website hit.

2558
02:50:55,948 --> 02:50:57,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Our B3 coverage helped a lot, too.

2559
02:50:57,588 --> 02:50:58,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And the shows have been doing really well.

2560
02:50:59,168 --> 02:51:01,069
[SPEAKER_02]: So the fuck-off shows and everything.

2561
02:51:01,109 --> 02:51:02,209
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody's done a great job.

2562
02:51:03,422 --> 02:51:16,325
[SPEAKER_05]: and also I am going to start doing well I'm going to be going to school so I don't know I may have to change the night that I do this but I am going to be doing at least one regular fuck off a week one regular fuck off a week?

2563
02:51:16,365 --> 02:51:32,448
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think that this week I might do video game trivia I have to find my CDs or re-download stuff but maybe not this week but next week for sure I'll get all the stuff ready to do music trivia cool very cool

2564
02:51:33,673 --> 02:51:34,733
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, yeah, it'll be fun.

2565
02:51:34,953 --> 02:51:37,074
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll do a fuck-off show at some point this week, too.

2566
02:51:37,114 --> 02:51:37,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably later.

2567
02:51:37,634 --> 02:51:42,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I tend to do them, like, uh, whenever I'm just, like, here, Friday or Saturday, late night.

2568
02:51:43,475 --> 02:51:45,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to figure out how to get them to run while I'm doing Ragnarok.

2569
02:51:45,915 --> 02:51:46,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

2570
02:51:46,715 --> 02:51:48,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to figure out how to get them to do while I'm doing Auro.

2571
02:51:48,736 --> 02:51:50,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I am seriously thinking about getting a Ragnarok account.

2572
02:51:51,136 --> 02:51:51,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh!

2573
02:51:51,316 --> 02:51:52,096
[SPEAKER_02]: This week, finally.

2574
02:51:52,136 --> 02:51:53,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Play on, play on, play on Chaos.

2575
02:51:55,157 --> 02:52:00,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna, I'm... To make everybody happy, I'm obviously gonna have to have one character on both.

2576
02:52:00,738 --> 02:52:00,978
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

2577
02:52:02,555 --> 02:52:04,636
[SPEAKER_02]: But, this is the thing, then I can have two different classes.

2578
02:52:04,797 --> 02:52:06,538
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay, one of them can be, like, my learning.

2579
02:52:06,578 --> 02:52:13,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, see, I figure when I do my next job class, I'm gonna do it on, um... If I do a merchant, I'm gonna do it on Chaos, so I can buy stuff cheap for my character.

2580
02:52:15,003 --> 02:52:19,967
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I do, um, any other job class, I'm gonna do it on, um, on the Loki server.

2581
02:52:20,947 --> 02:52:22,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I might do a Sakurai one, though.

2582
02:52:23,489 --> 02:52:24,409
[SPEAKER_21]: I started a Sakurai one.

2583
02:52:24,570 --> 02:52:30,894
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, there's three character slots for each server, independent to each server, so you can start three classes on each server.

2584
02:52:31,054 --> 02:52:31,134
[SPEAKER_21]: Um...

2585
02:52:32,114 --> 02:52:40,117
[SPEAKER_21]: And Loki's got technically less people on it at most times because Chaos was the original server, so there's more or a lot of people who were there since the beginning.

2586
02:52:40,838 --> 02:52:43,859
[SPEAKER_21]: So, if you want less lag, really there's not much lag on Chaos either.

2587
02:52:44,659 --> 02:52:47,200
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, because they only have like around 5,000 at the most.

2588
02:52:47,860 --> 02:52:49,641
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know, I didn't even think up 5,000, so.

2589
02:52:51,442 --> 02:52:57,765
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so it, yeah, I mean, it doesn't really matter what server you start on, it's just whichever one has more of your friends on it, go to that one, I guess.

2590
02:52:58,545 --> 02:52:58,885
[SPEAKER_21]: There's just

2591
02:52:59,617 --> 02:53:00,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, whatever.

2592
02:53:01,479 --> 02:53:06,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably won't even end up signing up because, like, you know, I maybe have to get back into PSO.

2593
02:53:09,086 --> 02:53:14,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine automatically, I remember when you talked about last week that yours auto-canceled, I went and looked at mine and mine auto-canceled too.

2594
02:53:15,091 --> 02:53:19,475
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to give a thank you to Sega for being a respectable company enough to do something like that, you know what I mean?

2595
02:53:19,516 --> 02:53:21,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless they just made it free.

2596
02:53:21,457 --> 02:53:22,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Which would be cool as well, but I don't know.

2597
02:53:22,959 --> 02:53:23,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I doubt that.

2598
02:53:25,700 --> 02:53:26,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Something else I wanted to say, though.

2599
02:53:26,800 --> 02:53:28,841
[SPEAKER_02]: We did get a lot of listening hours.

2600
02:53:28,941 --> 02:53:34,422
[SPEAKER_02]: However, our rating, our actual rating for the station, has fallen quite a bit in the past week.

2601
02:53:34,782 --> 02:53:41,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a feeling we're being zero-bombed by another station.

2602
02:53:41,804 --> 02:53:42,204
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.

2603
02:53:42,664 --> 02:53:43,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.

2604
02:53:43,104 --> 02:53:45,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just suspecting it, and I'm probably creating conspiracy theories it's going to be there.

2605
02:53:45,965 --> 02:53:49,206
[SPEAKER_02]: But I noticed that the rating for another Bomani station...

2606
02:53:51,351 --> 02:53:54,273
[SPEAKER_02]: has gone up significantly while ours has gone down.

2607
02:53:54,713 --> 02:53:56,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering if something's going on there.

2608
02:53:56,294 --> 02:53:56,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2609
02:53:57,214 --> 02:53:59,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's really unprofessional and very dubious.

2610
02:53:59,536 --> 02:54:00,356
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's true.

2611
02:54:00,396 --> 02:54:03,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably suspecting things I shouldn't be and going places I don't need to go.

2612
02:54:03,358 --> 02:54:05,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't listen to another station who did that.

2613
02:54:06,700 --> 02:54:07,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't either.

2614
02:54:08,181 --> 02:54:08,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Posers.

2615
02:54:10,862 --> 02:54:20,588
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, I listen to another station, but I have an obligation, you know, not just an obligation to... Well, I hate for their, that other station's thing that, you know, happened to them, because you know what comes around, you know...

2616
02:54:22,088 --> 02:54:25,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to say right now, it's not under Station Live, obviously.

2617
02:54:25,689 --> 02:54:26,710
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not DDR Freak.

2618
02:54:27,030 --> 02:54:30,691
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Freak Radio and Orange Ones Radio kind of have a silent agreement on where we're not going to go.

2619
02:54:30,711 --> 02:54:38,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to give a very big thank you to the powers that be with DDR Freak Radio for being very considerate of us, too.

2620
02:54:39,675 --> 02:54:41,076
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need to be partners.

2621
02:54:41,596 --> 02:54:45,838
[SPEAKER_05]: All of us, Bimani Stations, we need to be partners in this and not snipe each other.

2622
02:54:46,468 --> 02:54:47,369
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, yeah.

2623
02:54:47,689 --> 02:54:51,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just Petty, but all of us are working to promote the games and the music.

2624
02:54:51,411 --> 02:54:58,194
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope nobody came in in the middle of this and is thinking that, like, a specific station that we know of has been doing this, because we really don't know.

2625
02:54:58,254 --> 02:55:00,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob said, again, like, that he doesn't know.

2626
02:55:00,676 --> 02:55:02,257
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not interesting.

2627
02:55:02,337 --> 02:55:04,478
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just interesting that one goes down and one goes up.

2628
02:55:04,498 --> 02:55:05,198
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just interesting.

2629
02:55:05,919 --> 02:55:13,183
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and in all honesty, I've looked at a lot of Life 365 stations, and Orange Lounge is, like, really the only entertaining one.

2630
02:55:13,223 --> 02:55:13,643
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry.

2631
02:55:14,731 --> 02:55:16,553
[SPEAKER_21]: I personally like to listen to talk.

2632
02:55:16,573 --> 02:55:21,597
[SPEAKER_21]: If I want to listen to music, I'll just find pictures of the music files somewhere online.

2633
02:55:22,438 --> 02:55:26,441
[SPEAKER_21]: But if I want to listen to talk, it's like, Orison is the most interesting talk one.

2634
02:55:26,481 --> 02:55:29,764
[SPEAKER_21]: It's definitely more entertaining than any other ones out there.

2635
02:55:30,465 --> 02:55:36,350
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, Under Sundation is like a completely different subject, and that's really cool too, but as far as Bomani is concerned.

2636
02:55:36,910 --> 02:55:39,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I consider them to be our parents.

2637
02:55:40,633 --> 02:55:41,114
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um...

2638
02:55:42,220 --> 02:55:45,221
[SPEAKER_02]: What you can do, now don't vote other stations as zero.

2639
02:55:45,261 --> 02:55:45,841
[SPEAKER_02]: That's stupid.

2640
02:55:45,861 --> 02:55:46,641
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to do that.

2641
02:55:46,661 --> 02:55:51,683
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to check other stations out, we're not total Nazi radio people.

2642
02:55:51,723 --> 02:55:53,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Go vote for them however you want to vote.

2643
02:55:53,543 --> 02:55:54,643
[SPEAKER_02]: But for us, vote a five.

2644
02:55:55,004 --> 02:55:55,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, vote five.

2645
02:55:56,404 --> 02:55:57,224
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no choice.

2646
02:55:57,284 --> 02:55:59,065
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have your little live 365 window up.

2647
02:55:59,085 --> 02:56:01,545
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other numbers that pretend and don't work, so hit five.

2648
02:56:01,605 --> 02:56:06,026
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have your live 365 window up right now, just change that little vote in the bottom to a five, and we would love that.

2649
02:56:06,107 --> 02:56:07,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll come to your house and have sex with you.

2650
02:56:07,527 --> 02:56:07,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

2651
02:56:08,527 --> 02:56:09,648
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we'll send the monkeys.

2652
02:56:10,188 --> 02:56:17,113
[SPEAKER_21]: Rob can't see this, because Live365 doesn't supply this kind of technology for him to see the IPs of the people voting.

2653
02:56:17,513 --> 02:56:25,179
[SPEAKER_21]: But I can, because I have something that snipes in the middle and finds it, and so I can see who's voting bad, you know, and I will fucking blow up your computer.

2654
02:56:25,559 --> 02:56:26,860
[SPEAKER_21]: So don't vote anything low.

2655
02:56:26,940 --> 02:56:29,082
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll send our leak team a grad after you.

2656
02:56:30,022 --> 02:56:31,023
[SPEAKER_21]: I was just kidding, I can't.

2657
02:56:31,843 --> 02:56:32,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a loser.

2658
02:56:32,404 --> 02:56:33,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a fucking script kiddie.

2659
02:56:36,423 --> 02:56:46,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that being said, our little help us be the high-rated station as opposed to going down the crapper where we've been going recently.

2660
02:56:47,029 --> 02:56:48,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's time to wrap up the show.

2661
02:56:48,570 --> 02:56:49,130
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys say?

2662
02:56:49,710 --> 02:56:50,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

2663
02:56:50,030 --> 02:56:50,931
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we going to wrap it up in?

2664
02:56:50,971 --> 02:56:51,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Ribbons and bows?

2665
02:56:51,911 --> 02:56:53,953
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to wrap it up in pretty pink paper.

2666
02:56:53,973 --> 02:56:55,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Leather and pantyhose.

2667
02:56:55,173 --> 02:56:55,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2668
02:56:56,234 --> 02:56:57,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2669
02:56:57,154 --> 02:56:58,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thought time.

2670
02:56:58,115 --> 02:56:59,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with our guests.

2671
02:56:59,356 --> 02:57:01,557
[SPEAKER_02]: LankyStyle, your final thought, please.

2672
02:57:02,897 --> 02:57:04,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye Bye Bye by NSYNC and DDR.

2673
02:57:04,758 --> 02:57:05,019
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2674
02:57:08,297 --> 02:57:09,438
[SPEAKER_02]: RicePrincess, your final thought?

2675
02:57:10,038 --> 02:57:11,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, and bye.

2676
02:57:13,080 --> 02:57:13,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your final thought?

2677
02:57:16,722 --> 02:57:18,143
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll get these phones to work.

2678
02:57:18,523 --> 02:57:19,103
[SPEAKER_02]: It kills me.

2679
02:57:23,346 --> 02:57:28,588
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is... I don't know.

2680
02:57:28,849 --> 02:57:29,829
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my final thought.

2681
02:57:30,069 --> 02:57:31,070
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't know anymore.

2682
02:57:32,130 --> 02:57:32,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie?

2683
02:57:33,291 --> 02:57:34,732
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is give me money.

2684
02:57:36,912 --> 02:57:38,733
[SPEAKER_05]: and play Ragnarok on the Chaos Server.

2685
02:57:43,155 --> 02:57:44,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Just play Ragnarok.

2686
02:57:47,637 --> 02:57:51,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so, uh, I'm trying to queue up the outro still, sorry.

2687
02:57:51,699 --> 02:57:53,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody have an additional final thought?

2688
02:57:53,359 --> 02:57:54,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I do.

2689
02:57:54,540 --> 02:57:54,880
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2690
02:57:54,940 --> 02:57:57,241
[SPEAKER_05]: My socks are cool, because they have blue stars on them.

2691
02:58:01,123 --> 02:58:02,523
[SPEAKER_05]: And my cat's butt stinks.

2692
02:58:03,184 --> 02:58:04,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yay, I love your fortune cookie message.

2693
02:58:05,565 --> 02:58:05,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2694
02:58:06,858 --> 02:58:12,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the, uh, final word of the show goes to Jamie.

2695
02:58:13,762 --> 02:58:18,764
[SPEAKER_04]: The final word of the night is... Crack whore.

2696
02:58:20,385 --> 02:58:22,807
[SPEAKER_25]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2697
02:58:23,247 --> 02:58:27,089
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

2698
02:58:27,449 --> 02:58:29,310
[SPEAKER_25]: We expect you a nice play again.

2699
02:58:29,790 --> 02:58:32,572
[SPEAKER_25]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2700
02:58:34,384 --> 02:58:38,148
[SPEAKER_16]: I inherited my father's eyes and my mother's eating disorder.

2701
02:58:40,030 --> 02:58:41,832
[SPEAKER_16]: My mother and I have the same eating disorder.

2702
02:58:42,173 --> 02:58:52,484
[SPEAKER_18]: She said to me, when I was pregnant with you, I eat only cherry and I think that you are just one big cherry.

2703
02:58:53,993 --> 02:58:56,754
[SPEAKER_18]: You are just one big gay kitty!

2704
02:59:05,836 --> 02:59:10,497
[SPEAKER_16]: I was on the cover of The Star once and it was for this thing called the Chow Like Cho Diet.

2705
02:59:11,717 --> 02:59:14,378
[SPEAKER_16]: I was so fucking racist because they just made this diet up.

2706
02:59:14,398 --> 02:59:15,198
[SPEAKER_16]: They didn't consult me.

2707
02:59:15,258 --> 02:59:19,519
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it was like this total diet that they made up that they said that I went on and all these fake quotes from me.

2708
02:59:20,599 --> 02:59:23,500
[SPEAKER_17]: When I was young, I was raised on rice and fish.

2709
02:59:24,229 --> 02:59:28,355
[SPEAKER_17]: So when I get heavy, I go back to that natural Asian way of eating.

2710
02:59:29,156 --> 02:59:31,620
[SPEAKER_17]: You can almost hear the mandolin in the background.

2711
02:59:33,803 --> 02:59:38,230
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was a little girl and I grow up on the rice paddy

2712
02:59:38,806 --> 02:59:43,547
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have any food, because this was before Sally's daughter.

2713
02:59:44,208 --> 03:00:00,752
[SPEAKER_01]: So... We are so hungry all the time, and we have no money, and I want to go to the market to buy a chicken head, but I have no money, so I have to sell my finger.

2714
03:00:01,372 --> 03:00:05,534
[SPEAKER_13]: But... I... I...

2715
03:00:07,322 --> 03:00:21,908
[SPEAKER_01]: was very hungry but I still have tendency to put on weight which is why I really hope that I catch malaria because that is very good way to lose weight quickly, malaria and dysentery.

2716
03:00:26,229 --> 03:00:28,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.

2717
03:00:44,227 --> 03:00:47,370
The Afterbirth of Orange Lounge Radio.

2718
03:00:47,550 --> 03:00:48,570
Here we are.

2719
03:01:13,323 --> 03:01:14,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so what's up kids?

2720
03:01:15,343 --> 03:01:16,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything, uh, extra?

2721
03:01:16,524 --> 03:01:17,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Die, monster!

2722
03:01:17,564 --> 03:01:18,944
[SPEAKER_29]: You don't belong in this world!

2723
03:01:19,824 --> 03:01:22,505
[SPEAKER_29]: You take them souls and make them your slaves!

2724
03:01:23,145 --> 03:01:25,325
[SPEAKER_29]: Are you gonna, are you gonna do that as support on Cookie One Week?

2725
03:01:25,685 --> 03:01:27,646
[SPEAKER_03]: The same could be said of all religions.

2726
03:01:28,506 --> 03:01:29,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys just gonna act it out?

2727
03:01:29,566 --> 03:01:30,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know it.

2728
03:01:30,466 --> 03:01:31,986
[SPEAKER_02]: All I know is the die, monster part.

2729
03:01:32,266 --> 03:01:32,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I can do it.

2730
03:01:32,606 --> 03:01:33,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Grim Reaper.

2731
03:01:33,727 --> 03:01:35,047
[SPEAKER_02]: The Grim Reaper had the beginning.

2732
03:01:35,067 --> 03:01:35,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it!

2733
03:01:35,587 --> 03:01:35,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it!

2734
03:01:36,687 --> 03:01:37,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now?

2735
03:01:38,127 --> 03:01:40,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, there was supposed to be an ending where Maria turned evil.

2736
03:01:41,408 --> 03:01:42,028
[SPEAKER_13]: It does just sound

2737
03:01:42,375 --> 03:01:43,496
[SPEAKER_05]: The sound file's on the game.

2738
03:01:45,136 --> 03:01:48,798
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, like, who would have thought such a little girl had so much power?

2739
03:01:49,399 --> 03:01:50,559
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but she's like the best.

2740
03:01:53,221 --> 03:01:55,342
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I like the Grim Reaper part.

2741
03:01:55,722 --> 03:01:56,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, hello, God.

2742
03:01:57,463 --> 03:01:58,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I love his voice.

2743
03:01:58,944 --> 03:02:00,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, do the intro.

2744
03:02:02,145 --> 03:02:03,886
[SPEAKER_02]: The dark brief shaft.

2745
03:02:04,186 --> 03:02:06,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Do the intro to Castlevania, please.

2746
03:02:06,428 --> 03:02:07,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it, Brad, do it.

2747
03:02:07,148 --> 03:02:08,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm gonna fuck it up.

2748
03:02:08,228 --> 03:02:09,209
[SPEAKER_21]: Come on, do it, do it, do it.

2749
03:02:10,546 --> 03:02:13,527
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I need to get my, like, wine glass and my Dracula teeth.

2750
03:02:13,567 --> 03:02:13,927
[SPEAKER_21]: Come on.

2751
03:02:14,067 --> 03:02:14,827
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm so excited.

2752
03:02:16,208 --> 03:02:16,868
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't look at me.

2753
03:02:16,928 --> 03:02:17,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody look around.

2754
03:02:17,408 --> 03:02:18,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not looking at you.

2755
03:02:18,488 --> 03:02:19,489
Don't look at me.

2756
03:02:19,589 --> 03:02:20,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Die, monster.

2757
03:02:21,149 --> 03:02:22,710
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't belong in this world.

2758
03:02:23,370 --> 03:02:24,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody else has to do the Dracula part.

2759
03:02:25,291 --> 03:02:25,651
Oh, God.

2760
03:02:26,371 --> 03:02:28,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the Dracula part, so you just have to do your Dracula voice.

2761
03:02:28,392 --> 03:02:28,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2762
03:02:29,992 --> 03:02:33,193
[SPEAKER_21]: It was not by my hand that I was once again given flesh.

2763
03:02:34,373 --> 03:02:38,575
[SPEAKER_21]: I was brought here by humans who used to wish to pay me tribute.

2764
03:02:39,135 --> 03:02:39,635
[SPEAKER_21]: Tribute?

2765
03:02:40,089 --> 03:02:43,051
[SPEAKER_21]: You steal men's souls and make them your slaves.

2766
03:02:43,791 --> 03:02:45,832
[SPEAKER_21]: Perhaps the same could be said of all religions.

2767
03:02:46,833 --> 03:02:48,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Your words are as empty as your soul.

2768
03:02:49,395 --> 03:02:51,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Mankind ill needs a savior such as you.

2769
03:02:52,476 --> 03:02:53,377
[SPEAKER_03]: What is a man?

2770
03:02:53,877 --> 03:02:54,678
[SPEAKER_03]: For a little wine glass.

2771
03:02:55,218 --> 03:02:57,059
[SPEAKER_03]: A miserable little pile of secrets.

2772
03:02:57,379 --> 03:02:58,080
[SPEAKER_03]: But enough talk.

2773
03:02:58,300 --> 03:02:59,040
[SPEAKER_03]: How about you?

2774
03:02:59,060 --> 03:03:01,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, it was beautiful.

2775
03:03:02,728 --> 03:03:06,630
[SPEAKER_21]: That is the best dialogue out of any video game ever in the history of mankind.

2776
03:03:06,670 --> 03:03:07,731
[SPEAKER_02]: The acting is perfect.

2777
03:03:07,771 --> 03:03:08,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care what you think.

2778
03:03:08,871 --> 03:03:11,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, can you make a remix using those lines?

2779
03:03:13,394 --> 03:03:15,495
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why you wanted me to do it.

2780
03:03:15,535 --> 03:03:17,756
[SPEAKER_21]: I knew, I should have known that's why you wanted me to do that.

2781
03:03:18,877 --> 03:03:20,077
[SPEAKER_21]: Brad's voiced the game.

2782
03:03:20,737 --> 03:03:23,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got, I can give you the whole thing in Japanese.

2783
03:03:24,139 --> 03:03:25,080
[SPEAKER_21]: Die, monster.

2784
03:03:25,100 --> 03:03:26,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Die, monster.

2785
03:03:26,801 --> 03:03:30,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I should actually copy off my Japanese one, too, and play it for you.

2786
03:03:31,900 --> 03:03:33,641
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds really, really cool.

2787
03:03:34,101 --> 03:03:43,244
[SPEAKER_20]: I might do something like that, but unfortunately, my name starts with an M. What?

2788
03:03:43,464 --> 03:03:43,964
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

2789
03:03:44,184 --> 03:03:52,167
[SPEAKER_19]: In other words, I'm not a person that also has four letters in their name, begins with a T, ends with a N, and makes stupid remixes.

2790
03:03:52,267 --> 03:03:52,688
[SPEAKER_19]: So there.

2791
03:03:54,468 --> 03:03:55,308
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, then I'll do it.

2792
03:03:56,749 --> 03:03:58,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you know what that is backwards?

2793
03:03:58,890 --> 03:03:59,430
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Newt.

2794
03:04:02,421 --> 03:04:27,004
[SPEAKER_02]: well now I'm gonna make a remix called the beauty of silence silence mix and it's just gonna go the beauty of silence and then like a minute of silence and I'm gonna say see it's beautiful and then like sex noises in the back and kittens getting choked just kidding

2795
03:04:29,537 --> 03:04:32,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, do you want to give a plug to going to vote for Shermie?

2796
03:04:34,099 --> 03:04:42,021
[SPEAKER_05]: I put Shermie's picture up on RateMyKitten.com, but it's not up there yet, and I actually don't know where her site is for her picture.

2797
03:04:43,022 --> 03:04:44,122
[SPEAKER_05]: So she's just on there somewhere.

2798
03:04:45,463 --> 03:04:50,644
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a picture of Shermie on Mel's lap, being sleepy and cute.

2799
03:04:53,465 --> 03:04:53,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

2800
03:04:55,446 --> 03:04:58,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so does anybody else have anything they want to say for the wrap-up here?

2801
03:04:58,629 --> 03:04:59,510
[SPEAKER_02]: The Afterbirth.

2802
03:05:00,631 --> 03:05:00,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2803
03:05:01,471 --> 03:05:02,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fucking hungry, man.

2804
03:05:03,953 --> 03:05:05,295
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of snack foods up there.

2805
03:05:05,315 --> 03:05:06,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want snack foods.

2806
03:05:06,536 --> 03:05:07,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a meal.

2807
03:05:08,437 --> 03:05:09,618
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just want a meal.

2808
03:05:09,678 --> 03:05:11,540
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm tired of eating all these sneaky snacks.

2809
03:05:12,380 --> 03:05:13,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, poor thing.

2810
03:05:13,862 --> 03:05:14,102
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

2811
03:05:14,142 --> 03:05:14,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Poor thing.

2812
03:05:14,602 --> 03:05:15,543
[SPEAKER_02]: You can eat my dick.

2813
03:05:16,444 --> 03:05:17,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, that's too many calories.

2814
03:05:19,647 --> 03:05:20,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Or not.

2815
03:05:21,488 --> 03:05:22,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise you it's sweet.

2816
03:05:22,829 --> 03:05:23,690
[SPEAKER_13]: It's full of fat.

2817
03:05:23,770 --> 03:05:24,711
[SPEAKER_02]: And high in fiber.

2818
03:05:28,915 --> 03:05:29,776
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, kids.

2819
03:05:30,756 --> 03:05:31,997
[SPEAKER_02]: What, did somebody fart or something?

2820
03:05:35,600 --> 03:05:36,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, yes, Loki?

2821
03:05:37,981 --> 03:05:39,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki has something he'd like to share with you all.

2822
03:05:40,283 --> 03:05:40,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm scared.

2823
03:05:44,146 --> 03:05:46,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we just had, like, a bunch of radio silence.

2824
03:05:46,908 --> 03:05:47,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

2825
03:05:47,248 --> 03:05:48,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Mumble, mumble, mumble.

2826
03:05:48,429 --> 03:05:49,890
[SPEAKER_02]: That air is such great radio here.

2827
03:05:49,930 --> 03:05:50,810
[SPEAKER_04]: That's bullshit.

2828
03:05:54,453 --> 03:05:56,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, are you trying to do the poodle hat thing?

2829
03:05:57,950 --> 03:05:59,271
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to play a poodle hat track?

2830
03:06:01,873 --> 03:06:04,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Loki wants to play a poodle hat track for you all.

2831
03:06:05,296 --> 03:06:05,877
[SPEAKER_12]: A hat rack?

2832
03:06:06,037 --> 03:06:06,317
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

2833
03:06:12,583 --> 03:06:13,283
[SPEAKER_05]: It's quiet.

2834
03:06:14,044 --> 03:06:14,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

2835
03:06:14,805 --> 03:06:15,765
[SPEAKER_02]: This is shitty radio.

2836
03:06:16,666 --> 03:06:17,907
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk!

2837
03:06:17,987 --> 03:06:19,148
[SPEAKER_02]: I do too much talking.

2838
03:06:20,349 --> 03:06:22,411
[SPEAKER_02]: People complain that I talk too much, so I'm done.

2839
03:06:22,451 --> 03:06:23,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Rod, you talk too much.

2840
03:06:23,432 --> 03:06:23,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

2841
03:06:23,872 --> 03:06:24,413
[SPEAKER_02]: See what I mean?

2842
03:06:26,192 --> 03:06:27,795
[SPEAKER_02]: People, visit our live journal.

2843
03:06:27,936 --> 03:06:29,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody visit our forums.

2844

[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody vote us a five.

2845

[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to us all day long.

2846
03:06:44,956 --> 03:06:49,300
[SPEAKER_23]: and watch all the TV you ever wanted until your brain turned to mush.

2847
03:06:50,400 --> 03:06:53,263
[SPEAKER_23]: Would you go for it or just let it slip?

2848
03:06:53,703 --> 03:06:54,083
[SPEAKER_23]: Yo!

2849
03:06:54,944 --> 03:06:57,666
[SPEAKER_23]: The remote is ready, eyes wide, palms are sweaty.

2850
03:06:57,726 --> 03:07:00,388
[SPEAKER_15]: The Flintstones on the TV already, Wilma and Betty.

2851
03:07:00,428 --> 03:07:03,110
[SPEAKER_15]: No virgin, the channel's serving and I'm HD ready.

2852
03:07:03,190 --> 03:07:05,972
[SPEAKER_15]: So I flip, garbage is all I'm getting.

2853
03:07:05,992 --> 03:07:08,714
