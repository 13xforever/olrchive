1
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:12,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

2
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:21,050
[SPEAKER_09]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, for Monty Talk and then some.

3
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

4
00:00:24,813 --> 00:00:28,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

5
00:00:29,437 --> 00:00:34,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

6
00:00:34,813 --> 00:00:38,560
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:40,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I will spank your child.

8
00:00:40,724 --> 00:00:42,467
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

9
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:45,253
[SPEAKER_16]: Well...

10
00:00:48,157 --> 00:00:49,338
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's my big opening.

11
00:00:49,818 --> 00:00:50,938
[SPEAKER_13]: A sphincter says what?

12
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,240
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm super, thanks for asking.

13
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,201
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

14
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:58,122
[SPEAKER_16]: What am I doing here?

15
00:00:58,282 --> 00:00:59,863
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

16
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Dodge this.

17
00:01:01,884 --> 00:01:03,745
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a tasty burger.

18
00:01:03,985 --> 00:01:06,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.

19
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:07,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I have.

20
00:01:07,747 --> 00:01:09,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, just a flesh wound.

21
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:15,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.

22
00:01:16,957 --> 00:01:17,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah?

23
00:01:17,898 --> 00:01:21,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

24
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:22,482
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.

25
00:01:22,722 --> 00:01:23,622
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a sniff.

26
00:01:23,843 --> 00:01:24,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Skye.

27
00:01:24,503 --> 00:01:26,585
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

28
00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:27,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

29
00:01:27,746 --> 00:01:28,747
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate you!

30
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:31,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio.

31
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,851
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, the fighting's already begun.

32
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:40,676
[SPEAKER_14]: We are live, and this is episode number 46 for June the 1st of 2003.

33
00:01:40,736 --> 00:01:41,977
[SPEAKER_14]: You're tuned in to The Beast!

34
00:01:46,954 --> 00:01:48,735
[SPEAKER_14]: and the money scenes.

35
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:51,638
[SPEAKER_14]: Most super radio station of all things the money.

36
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,360
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

37
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:57,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.

38
00:01:57,883 --> 00:02:02,607
[SPEAKER_14]: In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Transformer herself, Jamie Summers.

39
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:03,868
[SPEAKER_05]: You gave us all stars.

40
00:02:04,788 --> 00:02:05,209
[SPEAKER_14]: I did.

41
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,831
[SPEAKER_14]: You know her better as Dark Sakura.

42
00:02:08,691 --> 00:02:10,833
[SPEAKER_14]: In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

43
00:02:11,654 --> 00:02:12,875
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a clean bill of health.

[SPEAKER_14]: You have a what?

45
00:02:14,596 --> 00:02:15,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Clean bill of health.

00:02:16,153 --> 00:02:25,776
[SPEAKER_14]: And also with us tonight, we have one special guest.

47
00:02:26,236 --> 00:02:28,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Say hello to the rice princess, Irene.

48
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:29,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, guys.

49
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Brad and Matt are coming later.

50
00:02:32,117 --> 00:02:37,018
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to get my mountain bike from his parents' house because I'm trying to lose weight.

51
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:37,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

52
00:02:40,342 --> 00:02:43,444
[SPEAKER_14]: Bike, Bike Revolution I made a vow.

53
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:44,184
[SPEAKER_14]: Huh?

54
00:02:44,344 --> 00:02:44,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I made a vow.

55
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:47,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to play five songs, five games of DDR every day.

56
00:02:48,306 --> 00:02:48,706
[SPEAKER_14]: At home?

57
00:02:49,387 --> 00:02:50,107
[SPEAKER_05]: At Scandia.

58
00:02:51,148 --> 00:02:51,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Every day?

59
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:52,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Every day.

60
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:53,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Every day?

61
00:02:53,249 --> 00:02:53,529
[SPEAKER_05]: After work.

62
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:54,809
[SPEAKER_05]: After work.

63
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:55,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

64
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,731
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to get motivated to that.

65
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:59,632
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll talk about some workout techniques later.

66
00:03:00,773 --> 00:03:04,554
[SPEAKER_14]: In the meantime, we're going to do some quick break.

67
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:07,036
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to have a fantabulous break.

68
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:07,916
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to play...

69
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:13,227
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to play the new promo, a brand new promo.

70
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:14,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Irene's all excited to hear it.

71
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:17,369
[SPEAKER_14]: I worked hard on this one today.

72
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:19,029
[SPEAKER_14]: This was like an hour today.

73
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, work hard now.

74
00:03:21,871 --> 00:03:22,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

75
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:23,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop the presence.

76
00:03:23,391 --> 00:03:26,813
[SPEAKER_14]: But actually, before that, we're going to have some music from 2DX7Style.

77
00:03:27,813 --> 00:03:29,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's underrated.

78
00:03:30,434 --> 00:03:35,816
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's underrated because obviously Konami in Tokyo doesn't like it because they haven't put out a home version of it yet.

79
00:03:36,136 --> 00:03:36,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Bitches.

80
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,997
[SPEAKER_14]: So fuck them in their ears.

81
00:03:39,116 --> 00:03:42,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so we'll be back after some fabulous 2DX7 Sound Music.

82
00:07:46,193 --> 00:07:47,215
Thank you for watching!

83
00:08:53,596 --> 00:08:54,276

00:09:42,536 --> 00:09:43,356
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm Miss Cleo.

87
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:45,497

00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,418
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm great, thanks.

90
00:09:48,578 --> 00:09:49,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you have a question?

91
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:55,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yes, actually I wanted to know... Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please?

92
00:09:57,021 --> 00:09:57,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh...

93
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,632
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, no, I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.

94
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:02,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, go ahead.

95
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:06,295
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?

96
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:07,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Is he incarcerated?

97
00:10:08,236 --> 00:10:09,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, actually, no, he's not.

98
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,818
[SPEAKER_14]: But what do you think of the ever-ranty DarkSakura?

99
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,258
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, dear, how are you?

100
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:14,559
[SPEAKER_10]: I love you.

101
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:16,280
[SPEAKER_14]: I see you two must know each other.

102
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what do you think of Skye?

103
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:19,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Did he used to play football when he was in high school?

104
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:21,603
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, actually, no, he didn't.

105
00:10:22,824 --> 00:10:24,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?

106
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,626
[SPEAKER_10]: I want you to really remember...

107
00:10:27,386 --> 00:10:28,487
[SPEAKER_10]: The Pill, all right?

108
00:10:28,968 --> 00:10:30,930
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly.

109
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,173
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.

110
00:10:34,894 --> 00:10:35,314
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

111
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:38,517
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well, thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.

112
00:10:38,657 --> 00:10:43,722
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but who are all of these nosy people?

113
00:10:43,963 --> 00:10:47,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card.

114
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:48,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Get away from me.

115
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:49,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Ha, ha, ha.

116
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.

117
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:57,024
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Miss Cleo.

118
00:10:57,364 --> 00:10:58,105
[SPEAKER_10]: I love you.

119
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:05,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, sorry, we are muted.

120
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:06,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, welcome back.

121
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,971
[SPEAKER_01]: That was so fucked up.

122
00:11:09,772 --> 00:11:13,915
[SPEAKER_14]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 46.

123
00:11:15,236 --> 00:11:16,196
[SPEAKER_14]: I still have SARS.

124
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:17,097
[SPEAKER_14]: This is bad.

125
00:11:19,451 --> 00:11:22,312
[SPEAKER_14]: This is very bad that I'm still sick after so much time.

126
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:23,013
[SPEAKER_05]: It's allergies.

127
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:23,973
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not sick.

128
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:24,754
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the allergies.

129
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:25,814
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's not allergies.

130
00:11:25,854 --> 00:11:26,114
[SPEAKER_14]: I swear.

131
00:11:26,134 --> 00:11:27,335
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the sick of the air.

132
00:11:27,595 --> 00:11:29,216
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I have a brain tumor.

133
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,537
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not the tumor.

134
00:11:33,738 --> 00:11:34,498
[SPEAKER_14]: No, seriously.

135
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:37,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, my head hurts, like, right up around here.

136
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,020
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not like a headache.

137
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,982
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a... I'll hit you somewhere else in your head and you won't hurt anymore.

138
00:11:41,022 --> 00:11:41,962
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really filthy.

139
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:42,683
[SPEAKER_14]: Get away from me.

140
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

141
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,424
[SPEAKER_05]: You put the hat on Cartman.

142
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:47,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I did.

143
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:48,566
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

144
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:09,183
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

145
00:12:09,543 --> 00:12:12,885
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, you know what you didn't do last week, even though I burned them for you?

146
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:13,285
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

147
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:15,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Those Night Style songs from the test location.

148
00:12:15,886 --> 00:12:16,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you're right.

149
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:18,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I conveniently... We burned them.

150
00:12:18,808 --> 00:12:19,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you did?

151
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:24,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I played some of them a few weeks ago, but, you know, we can play some... Those are ones that you didn't have.

152
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,552
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do some Night Style songs the next break.

153
00:12:26,572 --> 00:12:26,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

154
00:12:28,032 --> 00:12:28,913
[SPEAKER_05]: They're kind of crappy.

155
00:12:29,773 --> 00:12:31,034
[SPEAKER_05]: The quality is, anyway.

156
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:32,795
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to... Excuse me.

157
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:33,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Kermit.

158
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,420
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you talking about, bitch?

159
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,501
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just kidding.

160
00:12:42,703 --> 00:12:46,645
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to apologize to Maren Chan right off the bat because I gave her SARS when she was here last week.

161
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:47,666
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm really sorry.

162
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:48,266
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, Maren.

163
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:49,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Is she listening?

164
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:50,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course she's listening.

165
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:51,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi!

166
00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:53,829
[SPEAKER_14]: What, Loki?

167
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,812
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Loki's talking about causing pain to the masses and things like that.

168
00:13:00,553 --> 00:13:01,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, what else?

169
00:13:01,553 --> 00:13:02,494
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah, my brain tumor.

170
00:13:02,901 --> 00:13:09,345
[SPEAKER_14]: So, but what's really weird, now it's like in my ear, so I'm thinking maybe I have an ear infection.

171
00:13:10,146 --> 00:13:16,469
[SPEAKER_14]: But then... Rodney, we need to go to Walmart and get you a new head.

172
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, hey, Irene, Rodney's head.

173
00:13:20,152 --> 00:13:24,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, wait till Brad gets here, okay?

174
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:31,439
[SPEAKER_14]: It kind of reminds me, you remember, and I can make this Bomani related, you remember in Max PC...

175
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:35,766
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm John Max, you see, D.R.P.C., remember Jason Enos' character?

176
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:38,907
[SPEAKER_14]: How, like, the head was really small than the rest of the body?

177
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:45,549
[SPEAKER_14]: It made it look like, it looked like, it reminded me of that scene from Return to Oz, where the witch, like, had all the heads in a jar.

178
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:46,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

179
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,370
[SPEAKER_14]: And, like, she could take into it, because the head looked faked.

180
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,891
[SPEAKER_14]: It looked like it was just, like, screwed on.

181
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:51,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

182
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:54,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, Return to Oz was an awesome movie.

183
00:13:54,573 --> 00:13:55,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Good reference.

184
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,634
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked it because it was, like, just like the book.

185
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:01,344
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I think we need to do on Orange Haunts Radio some night?

186
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:03,466
[SPEAKER_14]: See if this is a rating success.

187
00:14:03,546 --> 00:14:03,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Read!

188
00:14:03,846 --> 00:14:06,208
[SPEAKER_14]: See if it's a rating success or a ratings disaster.

189
00:14:06,768 --> 00:14:08,469
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we have this neat new mixing board.

190
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:09,570
[SPEAKER_14]: We can loop in the TV.

191
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:12,512
[SPEAKER_14]: So we should watch a movie and comment along with it.

192
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:14,193
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be like Mystery Science Theater on the radio.

193
00:14:14,213 --> 00:14:15,514
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to watch Reading Rainbow.

194
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:19,277
[SPEAKER_14]: I am so sad.

195
00:14:19,357 --> 00:14:22,139
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't AP Reading Rainbow.

196
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,640
[SPEAKER_14]: I am sad.

197
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

198
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,823
[SPEAKER_05]: About them not having any more money to do more Reading Rainbow.

199
00:14:28,362 --> 00:14:30,663
[SPEAKER_14]: They haven't canceled Reading Rainbow yet.

200
00:14:30,683 --> 00:14:32,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but they can only do, what, four shows a year?

201
00:14:33,004 --> 00:14:33,664
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, it's sad.

202
00:14:33,844 --> 00:14:34,544
[SPEAKER_05]: That sucks.

203
00:14:34,564 --> 00:14:35,885
[SPEAKER_14]: They better not cancel Reading Rainbow.

204
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:36,865
[SPEAKER_14]: What will LeVar Burton do?

205
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:37,825
[SPEAKER_14]: That, like, sucks.

206
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:38,426
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, my God.

207
00:14:38,466 --> 00:14:43,047
[SPEAKER_14]: LeVar Burton will, like, have to retire because he's got... But he's a certified genius.

208
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:43,928
[SPEAKER_05]: He can get... That's true.

209
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:45,128
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll pay him for being smart.

210
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:46,869
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I saw on Game Show Network the other day?

211
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:47,469
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

212
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:49,350
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw The Weakest Link, Star Trek Edition.

213
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,330
[SPEAKER_14]: That was great.

214
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:50,950
[SPEAKER_14]: And he won.

215
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:52,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.

216
00:14:52,651 --> 00:14:55,272
[SPEAKER_05]: He's, like, an actual... Isn't he... What's his name?

217
00:14:55,922 --> 00:14:56,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's Mensa.

218
00:14:56,962 --> 00:15:03,885
[SPEAKER_14]: And not only did he win, he got like the highest jackpot in that game's history up to that point or something like that.

219
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:06,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't that fabulous?

220
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:08,047
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really smart.

221
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:11,748
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I enjoy hearing about smart people because the world is mostly full of idiots.

222
00:15:13,849 --> 00:15:15,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

223
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:23,413
[SPEAKER_05]: So... Smart people bring a smile to my face almost as much as seeing idiots, you know, die violent, horrible, bloody deaths.

224
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:26,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have any fun idiot watching stories to tell this week?

225
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:28,737
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you been out to the various arcades and seen any idiots?

226
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:31,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Just been driving on the road, plenty of idiots there.

227
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,598
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was at the mall today, you know, good figure.

228
00:15:34,178 --> 00:15:39,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, how was the rest of your day with Sharkskrull and Mel B, who were in town today?

229
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you were there for Mongo Chow.

230
00:15:42,101 --> 00:15:43,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, I was there for Mongo Chow.

231
00:15:43,321 --> 00:15:48,623
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we decided that we were going to go to the Idiot Mecca of Sacramento, which is Arden Fair Mall.

232
00:15:49,343 --> 00:15:52,784
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, there's also the Idiot Mecca of Roseville, which is, you know, the Galleria.

233
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:53,901
[SPEAKER_14]: What about Golfland?

234
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,302
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just like the retard mecca.

235
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,744
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a difference between idiots and retarded people.

236
00:15:59,685 --> 00:16:03,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, calling that the retard mecca would probably insult retarded people everywhere.

237
00:16:03,347 --> 00:16:03,708
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

238
00:16:04,308 --> 00:16:14,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, there were lots of stupid people everywhere and they were all driving and they were in the parking garage and we found like a really nice parking spot because it was in the second level of the garage by Sears so it was all shady.

239
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:17,518
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still hot and hot sucks.

240
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:21,400
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all the expresses everywhere are closed.

241
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:21,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Everywhere.

242
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:22,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Everywhere.

243
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:23,333
[SPEAKER_11]: The stores?

244
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:23,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

245
00:16:24,054 --> 00:16:24,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

246
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:25,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're remodeling or something.

247
00:16:26,335 --> 00:16:26,995
[SPEAKER_05]: That sucks.

248
00:16:27,035 --> 00:16:28,076
[SPEAKER_05]: She came all the way out here.

249
00:16:28,096 --> 00:16:29,677
[SPEAKER_14]: So Sharkskull wasted her trip completely?

250
00:16:29,797 --> 00:16:31,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, because she got something at Hot Topic.

251
00:16:31,838 --> 00:16:32,058
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

252
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:33,939
[SPEAKER_05]: She got a big, sloppy, fuzzy black hat.

253
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoa.

254
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:37,301
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a hat.

255
00:16:38,382 --> 00:16:39,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds kind of kinky.

256
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:40,243
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a hat.

257
00:16:41,664 --> 00:16:43,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And we went to Torrid.

258
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,426
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not a kinky hat.

259
00:16:44,706 --> 00:16:45,386
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a cute hat.

260
00:16:46,427 --> 00:16:50,189
[SPEAKER_05]: And we went to Torrid, and I looked at clothes I can't buy yet because I haven't gotten paid, and...

261
00:16:51,536 --> 00:16:53,718
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we listened to Strong Bad on the way home.

262
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:59,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we went to Scandia, ran into DJ Syndrome, and ran into... We need to get him on the show some night.

263
00:16:59,682 --> 00:17:01,863
[SPEAKER_05]: We ran into Ryan, some name I guess.

264
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,885
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to get him back on the show some night.

265
00:17:03,905 --> 00:17:06,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, because he's been falling off the face of the earth.

266
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,488
[SPEAKER_14]: No kidding, and where's Intern Zero?

267
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Intern Zero is probably working.

268
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that's true.

269
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Because remember, he works for my man now.

270
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:13,252
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

271
00:17:13,272 --> 00:17:15,013
[SPEAKER_05]: He is now indirectly my bitch.

272
00:17:18,402 --> 00:17:27,149
[SPEAKER_14]: And all of these celebrity interviews that we'll be doing in future weeks, you know, we'll always ask about Intern Zero, because we're always curious about, you know, what the celebrities think of our intern.

273
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:30,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we're very privileged to have Intern Zero on board here.

274
00:17:31,952 --> 00:17:42,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's, you know, we have a very privileged group, and, you know, we need to not forget about our foreign correspondent from the People's Republic of Davis, Abandoned Hope, all you who enter here, TM.

275
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:45,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we need to get Puppy back on the show, too.

276
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we need Puppy.

277
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Puppy, get your ass back out here.

278
00:17:48,522 --> 00:17:51,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, or we spank you with a rolled up newspaper.

279
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:52,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Bad puppy.

280
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:54,705
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm waiting for the big sniff in the chat room.

281
00:17:56,886 --> 00:17:57,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Waiting, waiting.

282
00:17:57,546 --> 00:18:04,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, if you want to join our chat room, head on over to www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and then click on chat.

283
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Chat, chat, chat, chat, chat.

284
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,491
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you can chat with our chatters in the chat room.

285
00:18:10,772 --> 00:18:15,854
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel really irresponsible because we're supposed to be working on the Battle Royale role-playing instead of him playing Ragnarok.

286
00:18:17,415 --> 00:18:17,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha!

287
00:18:17,715 --> 00:18:17,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha!

288
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:22,333
[SPEAKER_05]: I am so glad that it's gone pay-to-play.

289
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:27,677
[SPEAKER_14]: I am seriously thinking of starting Ragnarok now, because, like, I was watching Brad play the other night.

290
00:18:27,757 --> 00:18:29,038
[SPEAKER_14]: It was comedy gold.

291
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:29,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it great?

292
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:31,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you tell your Ragnarok story first.

293
00:18:31,841 --> 00:18:35,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, they went pay-to-play, which is the best thing that could have ever happened.

294
00:18:35,724 --> 00:18:43,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, sure, I'm going to have friends who I used to... who helped me level and get where I am today, character-wise, who are not going to pay-to-play.

295
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:45,552
[SPEAKER_05]: But, like, one friend gave me...

296
00:18:46,539 --> 00:19:15,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Like 250,000 zenny, which was a lot of the money in the game So I went out and bought a bunch of armor And now my character's badass And on top of that, since they introduced the pay-to-play Like today's the actual day it starts The server congestion went from about 13,000 people logged in To 6,500 Right around there Therefore there's no lag All of you people who decided to quit, thank you I love you

297
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:19,759
[SPEAKER_14]: But see, I'm thinking about starting to join now after watching Brad play the other day.

298
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:20,319
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

299
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:22,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, you and Brad play on different servers, though.

300
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,901
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, play on Chaos.

301
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:25,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you move your character from one server to another?

302
00:19:25,702 --> 00:19:26,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, you'll lose everything.

303
00:19:26,502 --> 00:19:27,123
[SPEAKER_14]: That's ass.

304
00:19:27,723 --> 00:19:28,343
[SPEAKER_05]: That is so ass.

305
00:19:28,363 --> 00:19:30,124
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can make two characters, one on each server.

306
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:31,225
[SPEAKER_14]: That might work.

307
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,886
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have to play on Chaos with me.

308
00:19:33,126 --> 00:19:35,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, but if I do it, if, if.

309
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,468
[SPEAKER_14]: I still have to cancel my PSO account first.

310
00:19:37,528 --> 00:19:39,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine was already canceled, believe it or not.

311
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,130
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

312
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even know mine was canceled.

313
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:43,792
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked up my stuff on...

314
00:19:44,577 --> 00:19:51,143
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go to Sega.com slash PSO underscore GCN I wonder if they just cancel you automatically if you don't play.

315
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Bless their little hearts if that's what they do.

316
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:57,048
[SPEAKER_05]: They keep your information there in case you want to start back up.

317
00:19:57,508 --> 00:19:59,710
[SPEAKER_05]: But I might start PSO back up later.

318
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:08,137
[SPEAKER_05]: But for right now, that's been my... I'll play, then I'll let my character sit and heal while I go off and do other stuff.

319
00:20:08,602 --> 00:20:11,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Marin has given us the Ragnarok report.

320
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,527
[SPEAKER_14]: There is currently 3,800 people logged into Chaos.

321
00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:15,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

322
00:20:16,569 --> 00:20:27,077
[SPEAKER_05]: And see, I'm so glad that she's paying to play too, because then I get my sauce on Ragnarok with me, and I can say, I have 50 fire arrows for you.

323
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:31,861
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, for those that don't play Ragnarok online, you visit the website www.

324
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:33,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Ragnarok online.

325
00:20:33,222 --> 00:20:33,622
[SPEAKER_05]: R-A-G-N-A...

326
00:20:38,246 --> 00:20:40,988
[SPEAKER_05]: R-O-K online dot com.

327
00:20:41,368 --> 00:20:41,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Excellent.

328
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,929
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe somebody in the chat room will be so kind as to post a link.

329
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,412
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's $12 a month unless you do pay by cash.

330
00:20:48,572 --> 00:20:50,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it's a little bit more because of the service charge.

331
00:20:51,034 --> 00:20:53,995
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not continuously updating your pay.

332
00:20:54,656 --> 00:20:56,457
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to pay every month manually.

333
00:20:57,157 --> 00:20:58,498
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually good.

334
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:00,599
[SPEAKER_05]: You can pay up to six months in advance.

335
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,100
[SPEAKER_05]: I paid three.

336
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,582
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit cheaper to pay three months or six months in advance.

337
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:07,163
[SPEAKER_05]: But I paid three months in advance.

338
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,063
[SPEAKER_05]: and if you want to find me on there, my username is Sorato, it's the only one I have.

339
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:14,424
[SPEAKER_14]: So what's the game like?

340
00:21:14,504 --> 00:21:17,647
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of like, the best way I can describe it is kind of like a multiplayer Secret of Mana.

341
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:31,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's like playing Secret of Mana, you have your individual character, you can form a party, you can share experience, which is really good if you're all trying to get levels quickly, because then every time you fight something, you'll all gain levels together.

342
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:38,322
[SPEAKER_05]: You can buy stuff, upgrade your armor, you can make your own quest.

343
00:21:39,986 --> 00:21:47,270
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also bosses hidden in the game where you and a billion other people can just tag team and rape this guy.

344
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:53,534
[SPEAKER_14]: Tag team raping only on Ragnarok Online.

345
00:21:53,774 --> 00:21:55,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the Troll King or something.

346
00:21:56,295 --> 00:21:59,797
[SPEAKER_14]: In the chat room, RiceRYC3 says, It's like Diablo 2 but cuter.

347
00:22:00,878 --> 00:22:02,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been hearing it's not like Ultima.

348
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:03,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Ultima Online.

349
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I never did play that.

350
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,601
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all point and click killing stuff.

351
00:22:07,003 --> 00:22:09,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me tell my funny, because I was watching, or actually it's really Brad's funny.

352
00:22:09,804 --> 00:22:20,446
[SPEAKER_14]: I was watching Brad play the other day, and I guess he was talking about this guy who was, you know, because of the server change, there's a lot of people, or the fact that they're going pay-to-play, there was a lot of people giving shit away on there.

353
00:22:20,846 --> 00:22:25,667
[SPEAKER_14]: So there was this guy, and he stood there, and he said, I'm going to give away my armor, and it's like this super rare armor.

354
00:22:25,687 --> 00:22:27,468
[SPEAKER_14]: He says, I'm going to give away my armor in ten minutes.

355
00:22:27,508 --> 00:22:28,048
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be right back.

356
00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:33,165
[SPEAKER_14]: So he, you know, he says that, and then all these people just start crowding around him, like tons and tons of people.

357
00:22:33,325 --> 00:22:34,845
[SPEAKER_05]: He's probably got lots of whispers.

358
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:37,587
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, just masses of people around him.

359
00:22:37,907 --> 00:22:41,449
[SPEAKER_14]: And then after ten minutes of this up, he goes, just kidding, and runs away.

360
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,370
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a guy in there.

361
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Leaving all the people standing there.

362
00:22:46,552 --> 00:22:48,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Who kept dropping cards and then picking them up.

363
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:56,737
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he's like, I'm going to drop all my cards, because cards are like, they're a one in one million item or something that you can fit.

364
00:22:57,738 --> 00:22:58,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I've gotten like a bajillion of them.

365
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, he says he's going to give away all of his cards.

366
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:08,807
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he drops one card, which is like a pouring card, which is like this little pink bubble thing, which is the weakest character in the game.

367
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:15,131
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he starts dropping like twigs, branches, flowers, which are all like little crap stuff.

368
00:23:16,372 --> 00:23:16,673
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

369
00:23:17,713 --> 00:23:25,019
[SPEAKER_14]: The other thing I watched Brad do, I actually suggest this, because this is the crazy thing about Ragnarok Online, is that when you go into the towns, there's just...

370
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:26,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Masses of people there.

371
00:23:26,841 --> 00:23:28,944
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean... Hi, we're AFK and clogging the server.

372
00:23:29,084 --> 00:23:32,449
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, there's just people just standing there in the middle of the town.

373
00:23:32,489 --> 00:23:33,771
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it looks like China.

374
00:23:34,221 --> 00:23:35,702
[SPEAKER_14]: in there, I swear to God.

375
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:37,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, and you can get flu masks in the game.

376
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,464
[SPEAKER_05]: You can put yourself up for Ragnarok cars.

377
00:23:40,484 --> 00:23:42,304
[SPEAKER_14]: I swear to God, Ragnarok online looks like China.

378
00:23:42,624 --> 00:23:48,327
[SPEAKER_14]: So, like, you go into the middle of the street or whatever, so I told Brad, hey, there's that big clusterfuck of people standing in the middle of the screen.

379
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:51,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Go run around them and go, I have SARS, cough, cough, cough.

380
00:23:52,548 --> 00:23:53,289
[SPEAKER_14]: And so he did it.

381
00:23:53,389 --> 00:23:56,730
[SPEAKER_14]: He ran in, he ran in the middle of the group, and he's all, I have SARS, cough, cough, cough.

382
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:03,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Literally, the second after he did that, someone summoned a monster into town that just started running around killing all the people that were idling.

383
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:04,909
[SPEAKER_14]: It was great.

384
00:24:05,209 --> 00:24:06,230
[SPEAKER_14]: And Brad's like, gotta go!

385
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,331
[SPEAKER_05]: This is great, though, because people have been protesting the charge.

386
00:24:10,711 --> 00:24:12,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is, I think, so retarded.

387
00:24:12,972 --> 00:24:18,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they knew from the beginning that the whole reason that they were beta testing us is that you would eventually pay for the service.

388
00:24:19,555 --> 00:24:20,395
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is great.

389
00:24:21,355 --> 00:24:24,517
[SPEAKER_05]: And for all you people who play, I don't know if they still have it up, but this is hilarious.

390
00:24:26,217 --> 00:24:27,057
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a warp.

391
00:24:27,838 --> 00:24:28,458
[SPEAKER_05]: And the phone's ringing.

392
00:24:28,478 --> 00:24:28,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

393
00:24:28,962 --> 00:24:29,682
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a warp.

394
00:24:29,742 --> 00:24:31,684
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't take phone calls on the show yet, sorry.

395
00:24:31,724 --> 00:24:35,566
[SPEAKER_05]: On the south gate of, uh, Pontera, which is like the middle, uh, town.

396
00:24:36,446 --> 00:24:43,190
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh... Oh, stop picking it up.

397
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:43,630
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

398
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,491
[SPEAKER_14]: It's spam.

399
00:24:45,511 --> 00:24:46,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's spam?

400
00:24:46,132 --> 00:24:46,212
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

401
00:24:47,893 --> 00:24:49,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Do not ruin this show to bring us...

402
00:24:50,515 --> 00:25:15,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Hand, hand, hand, hey, hand, hey, hand, hand, hey That could have been the most important call of my life, according to that Hand, come here, hand, hand, hand I was only telling a story Alright, sorry Jamie They set up a warp right in the gate, the south gate of town So if you leave town, you go into this warp And it warps you to the Christmas village

403
00:25:16,526 --> 00:25:20,588
[SPEAKER_05]: So like you're in, and everybody is trapped in a corral with no way out.

404
00:25:20,608 --> 00:25:21,648
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

405
00:25:22,328 --> 00:25:27,370
[SPEAKER_05]: So the only way you can get out is to use something called a fly wing, which will teleport you to another part of town.

406
00:25:28,591 --> 00:25:31,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Luckily for me, I have a fly wing, so I go to the other part of town.

407
00:25:32,472 --> 00:25:36,554
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's always people going, let us out, let us out.

408
00:25:36,854 --> 00:25:38,154
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, ah.

409
00:25:38,654 --> 00:25:39,335
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I got killed.

410
00:25:39,615 --> 00:25:40,415
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I went back there.

411
00:25:41,491 --> 00:25:56,598
[SPEAKER_05]: and like if you leave there you have to like dodge abominable snowmans and things and like they'll like they're aggressive so they chase you but I have high agility so I run away this is a fun topic I want to solicit stories from the chat room if anybody has any funny online game stories this is really nerdy but it can be funny

412
00:25:57,048 --> 00:26:01,331
[SPEAKER_14]: If anybody has any really good online game stories that are funny, send them to me in private message in the chatroom.

413
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:02,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is the part that sucks.

414
00:26:02,651 --> 00:26:08,915
[SPEAKER_05]: The only way out of the Christmas Village, besides warping, is going through the south warp past all the aggressive creatures.

415
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:12,257
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes you to a city called Aldebaran, which is like way in the north.

416
00:26:12,937 --> 00:26:19,341
[SPEAKER_05]: The only way to get out of that town is to walk past three screens full of aggressive creatures that will kill me in two hits.

417
00:26:20,882 --> 00:26:21,563
[SPEAKER_05]: And I made it out.

418
00:26:21,683 --> 00:26:22,163
[SPEAKER_05]: I was happy.

419
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:29,196
[SPEAKER_06]: The wizards or whatever, weren't they the ones that were like, you have to pay me to get out of here and I can warp you out of here?

420
00:26:29,216 --> 00:26:30,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they have the ability to warp.

421
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:33,838
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of them in the game, they're just like, may I have the heal, please?

422
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:34,378
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll heal you.

423
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:35,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, hey, cool.

424
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:37,999
[SPEAKER_05]: And I ran into a swordman.

425
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:41,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Swordies are cool to hang out with because they'll kill stuff for you.

426
00:26:42,361 --> 00:26:44,801
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're low level, they'll kill stuff and then they'll let you tank on them.

427
00:26:45,282 --> 00:26:49,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Which tanking means they'll attack a creature once so that the creature keeps hitting them over and over.

428
00:26:50,163 --> 00:26:52,104
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can kill the creature and get the experience from it.

429
00:26:53,385 --> 00:26:57,328
[SPEAKER_05]: and so I hung out with one who killed a bunch of people for me and then I left.

430
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:01,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Does Ragnarok still have really bad English?

431
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's beautiful.

432
00:27:03,752 --> 00:27:05,673
[SPEAKER_05]: It's core English.

433
00:27:06,573 --> 00:27:07,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Because remember, it's Korean.

434
00:27:10,616 --> 00:27:14,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so I'm going to shift gears and talk about a different online game that we brought up earlier, PSO.

435
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:20,222
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I mentioned this on a previous show, but I'll tell you the funniest thing I've ever seen in PSO.

436
00:27:20,582 --> 00:27:21,883
[SPEAKER_14]: Were you there, Loki, when I was watching this?

437
00:27:22,421 --> 00:27:23,202
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

438
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:44,403
[SPEAKER_14]: There were all these people standing there and then one guy decides to just start running laps around the room.

439
00:27:44,684 --> 00:27:47,086
[SPEAKER_14]: He's just running around in a giant circle.

440
00:27:47,406 --> 00:27:52,491
[SPEAKER_14]: You actually can see everybody watching him as he's running around the circle on the screen.

441
00:27:52,852 --> 00:27:54,133
[SPEAKER_14]: And people are going, what the hell?

442
00:27:55,034 --> 00:27:58,798
[SPEAKER_14]: And then suddenly a couple other guys decide to join him and they all start running around in a circle.

443
00:27:58,818 --> 00:28:02,181
[SPEAKER_14]: And then suddenly the entire server room is doing a big conga line.

444
00:28:03,192 --> 00:28:04,973
[SPEAKER_14]: It was the gayest thing ever, but it was so funny.

445
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:07,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to send some pictures for next week.

446
00:28:07,575 --> 00:28:08,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I have pictures.

447
00:28:09,276 --> 00:28:12,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Every so often I'll save the screen capture for when I'm playing Ragnarok.

448
00:28:12,939 --> 00:28:22,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a picture of this place in the desert town where I was getting my weapons upgraded and some friends met me there and then random people were there and we all formed a conga line.

449
00:28:24,168 --> 00:28:26,770
[SPEAKER_14]: StaplerX has an interesting story to share here in our chat room.

450
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,072
[SPEAKER_14]: He says, My friend Chris made a female account.

451
00:28:29,778 --> 00:28:32,299
[SPEAKER_14]: and as soon as he logged in, a guy started flirting with him.

452
00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:36,260
[SPEAKER_14]: He kept stalking him until he logged out and he never used the account again.

453
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you ever find yourself getting hit on as a female game player?

454
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,261
[SPEAKER_05]: All the time, but it's a good thing because they give me stuff.

455
00:28:45,102 --> 00:28:45,882
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a story.

456
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:58,805
[SPEAKER_12]: We played, well this was back when Ultima Online was first getting started and we were just being really stupid so what we did was we stripped our character of all of his clothes and just said he got player killed

457
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:01,076
[SPEAKER_12]: and kept begging for stuff from people.

458
00:29:01,496 --> 00:29:03,958
[SPEAKER_12]: And the player's name was Italian Sausage.

459
00:29:04,478 --> 00:29:10,842
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, um, we were just running around yelling Sausage for Sale and just being, like, really annoying.

460
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:11,803
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, what game was this?

461
00:29:12,263 --> 00:29:12,763
[SPEAKER_12]: Ultima Online.

462
00:29:12,883 --> 00:29:13,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay, Ultima Online.

463
00:29:13,944 --> 00:29:14,484
[SPEAKER_12]: It was fun.

464
00:29:14,864 --> 00:29:15,945
[SPEAKER_12]: We were really bored that day.

465
00:29:17,786 --> 00:29:19,567
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also a lot of idiots on Ragnarok.

466
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:26,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Just randomly, I was in this one place that, um, that, um, Marienchan, uh, showed me.

467
00:29:26,812 --> 00:29:28,913
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an island that you have to get to from Alberta.

468
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:30,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, we were just sitting there.

469
00:29:31,293 --> 00:29:33,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I'm in the cave leading in.

470
00:29:33,534 --> 00:29:34,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just waiting.

471
00:29:34,194 --> 00:29:35,514
[SPEAKER_05]: So I set up a chat room in there.

472
00:29:35,915 --> 00:29:37,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Said, toll booth 200 zeni.

473
00:29:38,475 --> 00:29:39,175
[SPEAKER_05]: And people paid me.

474
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:43,236
[SPEAKER_05]: I got like 600.

475
00:29:43,436 --> 00:29:45,077
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

476
00:29:45,137 --> 00:29:46,577
[SPEAKER_05]: And other people, this is a great idea.

477
00:29:46,597 --> 00:29:47,677
[SPEAKER_05]: They set up a kissing booth.

478
00:29:47,697 --> 00:29:51,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's an emoticon in the game that makes a smoochie and then a little heart comes up.

479
00:29:52,219 --> 00:29:53,059
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're making money.

480
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:56,740
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to do, though, what one of my friends did.

481
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot who this was.

482
00:29:58,823 --> 00:29:59,603
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so long ago.

483
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:10,446
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the people I was playing with back when I first was playing the second beta, decided, they wrote on the pages, like, sex or 500 zenny or something.

484
00:30:10,986 --> 00:30:11,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Or 5,000.

485
00:30:11,566 --> 00:30:14,807
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, the person went in there and paid up front.

486
00:30:15,187 --> 00:30:16,247
[SPEAKER_05]: She was like, haha, you got fucked.

487
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:21,288
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.

488
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:27,990
[SPEAKER_14]: So, okay, we can bring this around to Bomani somehow, believe it or not, because with the new DDR going to go online,

489
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:29,891
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yay.

490
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:30,111
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yay.

491
00:30:30,131 --> 00:30:33,614
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it should be like DanceMagic.

492
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:56,268
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why we should work for Konami.

493
00:31:25,993 --> 00:31:27,774
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm looking for funny stories right now.

494
00:31:29,335 --> 00:31:30,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you enjoying that food?

495
00:31:30,275 --> 00:31:30,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

496
00:31:31,636 --> 00:31:33,076
[SPEAKER_14]: More funny online gaming stories.

497
00:31:33,677 --> 00:31:33,877
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

498
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:35,898
[SPEAKER_14]: I think so.

499
00:31:36,078 --> 00:31:37,018
[SPEAKER_14]: They're probably in the cupboard up there.

500
00:31:37,878 --> 00:31:38,118
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

501
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:38,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

502
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:45,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Rice, RYC3, would like to say, This one time I was playing Counter-Strike and the server had friendly fire on.

503
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:48,103
[SPEAKER_14]: I just entered the server and killed this guy for his gun.

504
00:31:48,143 --> 00:31:49,463
[SPEAKER_14]: He got pissed and I left the server.

505
00:31:50,044 --> 00:31:50,364
[SPEAKER_14]: Meanie.

506
00:31:52,365 --> 00:31:53,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you can have some Triscuits.

507
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Dieter, our angel, has a story to share.

508
00:31:58,801 --> 00:32:01,402
[SPEAKER_14]: Dad and I were playing Diablo 2 on our own server.

509
00:32:01,862 --> 00:32:06,324
[SPEAKER_14]: We came to Upper Cresat and go after the council members one by one.

510
00:32:06,745 --> 00:32:09,766
[SPEAKER_14]: I start running around just to get the little monsters to get experience.

511
00:32:09,846 --> 00:32:13,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Next thing you know, somehow I end up having all seven council members chasing me.

512
00:32:13,928 --> 00:32:14,789
[SPEAKER_14]: I scream, help!

513
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:16,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Dad goes, how did you do that?

514
00:32:16,609 --> 00:32:17,830
[SPEAKER_14]: I go, I don't know.

515
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Dad proceeds to kill all their asses in less than five minutes while I lay there dead.

516
00:32:25,256 --> 00:32:30,418
[SPEAKER_14]: That's so interesting, because I've never heard of anybody playing online games with their parents.

517
00:32:30,478 --> 00:32:32,739
[SPEAKER_14]: That would scare me, to run into my mother.

518
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:38,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Terry would totally, I could see that happening, like, when his kids get older, he'd be gaming with them.

519
00:32:38,901 --> 00:32:54,046
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, he's just cool like that, and you know that any of us, when we have kids, we're going to play games with our kids, too, but I just, as it is now, I could never imagine, like, my mother, or my dad, no, my dad's actually computer savvy, and there are some computer games he's played in the past, mostly solitaire and shit, like card games, but...

520
00:32:54,935 --> 00:33:00,417
[SPEAKER_14]: If I were to run into him on an online game, I'd, like, zap him so he couldn't, like, he couldn't embarrass me.

521
00:33:00,457 --> 00:33:01,077
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd kill him.

522
00:33:02,658 --> 00:33:03,718
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what my party is named?

523
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:05,339
[SPEAKER_14]: Huh?

524
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:07,499
[SPEAKER_05]: My party is named Battle Royale.

525
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:08,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course.

526
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to make a guild called Battle Royale.

527
00:33:11,681 --> 00:33:12,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Or BR Act.

528
00:33:14,922 --> 00:33:15,582
[SPEAKER_14]: The BR Act.

529
00:33:17,243 --> 00:33:17,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

530
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:22,415
[SPEAKER_14]: I really like that idea of DDR Online having a dancing conquest.

531
00:33:22,576 --> 00:33:22,996
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be cool.

532
00:33:23,016 --> 00:33:23,436
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be awesome.

533
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:28,197
[SPEAKER_14]: What other cool DDR Online ideas have people thought of in their... How about this?

534
00:33:28,518 --> 00:33:29,958
[SPEAKER_12]: How about they don't make it?

535
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:32,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, there's an idea.

536
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:35,740
[SPEAKER_14]: I know what's wrong.

537
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,180
[SPEAKER_14]: You're here.

538
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,561
[SPEAKER_14]: Shut up, bitch.

539
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:39,881
[SPEAKER_14]: That has nothing to do with the topic of the ad.

540
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:46,424
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they should make Stroker Online, because that combination would work great.

541
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:48,969
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody gets that, Loki.

542
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:49,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody.

543
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:50,630
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care.

544
00:33:51,391 --> 00:33:52,932
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what game they need to make another one of?

545
00:33:53,112 --> 00:33:53,352
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

546
00:33:53,572 --> 00:33:54,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Freaking Night Trap.

547
00:33:55,914 --> 00:33:56,875
[SPEAKER_14]: Night Trap 2.

548
00:33:56,995 --> 00:33:58,436
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be the shit.

549
00:33:58,496 --> 00:33:59,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you hear that?

550
00:33:59,137 --> 00:33:59,877
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wait.

551
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:00,958
[SPEAKER_14]: No, Night Trap wasn't on 3DO.

552
00:34:01,018 --> 00:34:02,779
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a Sega CD game, wasn't it?

553
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:03,820
[SPEAKER_05]: I own the damn game.

554
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,281
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a Sega CD.

555
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:06,762
[SPEAKER_14]: 3DO filed for bankruptcy this week.

556
00:34:07,002 --> 00:34:07,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

557
00:34:07,563 --> 00:34:14,088
[SPEAKER_14]: And whenever I think of 3DO, though, I think of that horrible, horrible, horrible Zelda game.

558
00:34:15,569 --> 00:34:16,229
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a CD-I.

559
00:34:16,249 --> 00:34:16,790
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a CD-I.

560
00:34:17,463 --> 00:34:18,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't that 3DO?

561
00:34:18,343 --> 00:34:19,704
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was 3DX.

562
00:34:20,364 --> 00:34:21,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Never mind.

563
00:34:23,005 --> 00:34:26,506
[SPEAKER_12]: 3DO I'll always remember as the first time playing You Don't Know Jack.

564
00:34:27,806 --> 00:34:29,427
[SPEAKER_14]: What the fuck did 3DO do then?

565
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,527
[SPEAKER_14]: They made the stupid Army Man games.

566
00:34:32,768 --> 00:34:33,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't they have a system?

567
00:34:33,768 --> 00:34:35,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Wasn't there a system called 3DO?

568
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:37,249
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a 3DO, but I don't think it was the same people.

569
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:39,370
[SPEAKER_14]: What the fuck was on the 3DO system?

570
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:40,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Flashback.

571
00:34:41,271 --> 00:34:41,651
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it?

572
00:34:41,691 --> 00:34:43,211
[SPEAKER_14]: That was their biggest game was Flashback?

573
00:34:43,711 --> 00:34:45,832
[SPEAKER_05]: They had this, like, it was supposedly this, you know...

574
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:46,874
[SPEAKER_05]: What was it called?

575
00:34:46,914 --> 00:34:48,814
[SPEAKER_05]: The something M technology?

576
00:34:49,034 --> 00:34:50,435
[SPEAKER_05]: They had Road Rage.

577
00:34:51,075 --> 00:34:51,755
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, here we go.

578
00:34:52,115 --> 00:34:52,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Road Rage.

579
00:34:53,355 --> 00:34:54,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Eternal Champions.

580
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:55,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, chat room.

581
00:34:55,236 --> 00:34:57,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Eternal Champions was not on the freaking 3DO.

582
00:34:57,736 --> 00:34:58,136
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you sure?

583
00:34:58,476 --> 00:35:01,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm more than positive Kabuki Clash was on the 3DO.

584
00:35:04,957 --> 00:35:07,598
[SPEAKER_14]: I just remember those things were like 400 bucks.

585
00:35:07,698 --> 00:35:08,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck that.

586
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:12,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Eternal Champions was on the Genesis and the Eternal Champions CD was on the Sega CD.

587
00:35:12,999 --> 00:35:14,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I own the game and I should know.

588
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:15,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I even bought...

589
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,901
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the thing called?

590
00:35:16,921 --> 00:35:17,521
[SPEAKER_05]: The Menacer?

591
00:35:17,722 --> 00:35:18,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't that what it was called?

592
00:35:19,303 --> 00:35:19,983
[SPEAKER_05]: The Activator.

593
00:35:22,465 --> 00:35:23,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I have got a Menacer.

594
00:35:23,366 --> 00:35:24,486
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've got an Activator too.

595
00:35:24,506 --> 00:35:25,988
[SPEAKER_05]: The one that's like the arena.

596
00:35:26,728 --> 00:35:28,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought it at Virgin like a year ago.

597
00:35:30,531 --> 00:35:32,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it came with Eternal Champions.

598
00:35:35,254 --> 00:35:36,175
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in my closet.

599
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:36,735
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

600
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:40,298
[SPEAKER_14]: I kind of want a CDI system and a 3DO just because

601
00:35:40,868 --> 00:35:42,188
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, nobody has them.

602
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,049
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what shitty system I want?

603
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:44,829
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

604
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,090
[SPEAKER_05]: A Jaguar CD.

605
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,031
[SPEAKER_14]: I want a Jaguar.

606
00:35:48,051 --> 00:35:49,091
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can play Defender 2000.

607
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:50,752
[SPEAKER_14]: I want Tempest 2000.

608
00:35:51,212 --> 00:35:53,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you can get it on Saturn then.

609
00:35:53,353 --> 00:35:55,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, but I want the Jaguar version.

610
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:56,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Same damn name.

611
00:35:58,274 --> 00:36:02,716
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's Atari system and it's Atari game, so... And it's easier to control on the... Shush!

612
00:36:05,317 --> 00:36:05,717
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

613
00:36:05,937 --> 00:36:06,837
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got a Saturn, right?

614
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:08,418
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I have a Saturn?

615
00:36:10,054 --> 00:36:10,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki has a Saturn.

616
00:36:10,855 --> 00:36:12,236
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll bring you over Tempest 2000 next week.

617
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:12,876
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, dear Lord.

618
00:36:13,917 --> 00:36:14,317
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

619
00:36:14,357 --> 00:36:16,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Pre-show next week should be all Tempest 2000 songs.

620
00:36:16,618 --> 00:36:17,219
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm down with that.

621
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:26,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, I want to do... Jamie, you have to let me do one pre-show one week because I want to do... Yes.

622
00:36:26,524 --> 00:36:28,285
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to do Commodore 64 music.

623
00:36:28,385 --> 00:36:29,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God, yes.

624
00:36:30,226 --> 00:36:35,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hear what Bradley posted in response to your Commodore 64?

625
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:35,589
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on.

626
00:36:35,629 --> 00:36:36,090
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me bring it up.

627
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:36,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

628
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:36,350
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

629
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:40,307
[SPEAKER_14]: For those of you that listen to Orange Lingerie like all the time, that would be the cool people.

630
00:36:40,807 --> 00:36:46,529
[SPEAKER_14]: On Friday night, you would have heard me doing a fuck-off show because I was really bored and Irene flaked on me for going out Friday night.

631
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:51,691
[SPEAKER_14]: So I played a bunch of 80s music and that led into talk about Commodore 64.

632
00:36:52,191 --> 00:36:55,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the Commodore 64 was like the coolest computer system ever.

633
00:36:55,572 --> 00:36:57,473
[SPEAKER_14]: And it just turned 20 years old like two months ago.

634
00:36:57,573 --> 00:37:01,154
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyway, so I had a point to this.

635
00:37:01,414 --> 00:37:03,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah, I started downloading all these games and stuff.

636
00:37:03,883 --> 00:37:09,006
[SPEAKER_14]: and one of them, one of the most memorable games for me on Commodore 64 was Impossible Mission.

637
00:37:09,587 --> 00:37:11,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Tell us a little bit about Impossible Mission, Irene.

638
00:37:12,789 --> 00:37:14,190
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really cheesy.

639
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:20,013
[SPEAKER_06]: It had really bad voice acting and you basically had to try to like put them together as well.

640
00:37:20,334 --> 00:37:23,315
[SPEAKER_06]: They were like pieces of paper that had little, you know, squiggly marks and stuff.

641
00:37:23,335 --> 00:37:27,178
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, it had really bad like pseudo voice acting.

642
00:37:27,728 --> 00:37:32,050
[SPEAKER_06]: and Rob's going to be pulling up a special treat or whatever.

643
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,270
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really hard.

644
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:37,972
[SPEAKER_06]: You had to time it and if you didn't beat it by then, then you died for some reason.

645
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:38,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really remember.

646
00:37:39,653 --> 00:37:40,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but it was a great game.

647
00:37:40,913 --> 00:37:42,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Rob, you know what I want to bring over?

648
00:37:44,415 --> 00:37:44,655
What?

649
00:37:45,295 --> 00:37:46,075
[SPEAKER_05]: My ColecoVision.

650
00:37:46,876 --> 00:37:48,036
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you have on ColecoVision?

651
00:37:48,076 --> 00:37:49,677
[SPEAKER_14]: What don't I have?

652
00:37:50,457 --> 00:37:51,418
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the Odyssey.

653
00:37:51,918 --> 00:37:52,298
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

654
00:37:52,678 --> 00:37:55,079
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't even have a TV that my Odyssey will work with.

655
00:37:55,711 --> 00:38:00,135
[SPEAKER_05]: You need one of those old ones with, like, the prong hookup thingies.

656
00:38:01,736 --> 00:38:02,256
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, hold on.

657
00:38:02,276 --> 00:38:04,258
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to download that sound clip we were talking about earlier.

658
00:38:04,418 --> 00:38:04,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, my God.

659
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:06,379
[SPEAKER_14]: If I can get it.

660
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:07,280
[SPEAKER_05]: But we need to play Smurfs.

661
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:13,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I can bring over the 2600 and we can play the worst game ever.

662
00:38:13,505 --> 00:38:13,745
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

663
00:38:14,106 --> 00:38:15,547
[SPEAKER_14]: E.T.

664
00:38:15,687 --> 00:38:16,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Pac-Man.

665
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:19,250
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw this hilarious commercial on G4 today.

666
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:23,273
[SPEAKER_14]: There was this guy, and I guess he was a programmer or whatever, and he says, Hey, I'm so-and-so.

667
00:38:23,763 --> 00:38:31,047
[SPEAKER_14]: and I programmed Yar's Revenge and I programmed, um, he said, I programmed Yar's Revenge and I programmed, what was the other thing he'd done?

668
00:38:31,467 --> 00:38:36,249
[SPEAKER_14]: And then he goes, he said, I programmed Yar's Revenge, I programmed Raiders of the Lost Ark and I programmed E.T.

669
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:38,110
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like that.

670
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:42,352
[SPEAKER_14]: He's like, so I'm known for one of the best 2600 games of all time and one of the worst.

671
00:38:43,973 --> 00:38:46,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, oh, here's that sound file we were talking about earlier, kids.

672
00:38:49,736 --> 00:38:50,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Arrrr!

673
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:51,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Arrrr!

674
00:38:51,797 --> 00:38:51,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Arrrr!

675
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:59,021
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the sound every time you die or fall down a hole or you see Irene naked.

676
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't touch.

677
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:11,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, what, Loki?

678
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:14,010
[SPEAKER_14]: It should be in the next intro, he says.

679
00:39:14,491 --> 00:39:15,051
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I agree.

680
00:39:15,131 --> 00:39:15,751
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

681
00:39:15,891 --> 00:39:16,332
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

682
00:39:16,352 --> 00:39:18,293
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll bring the 5200 over and we'll play Kicks.

683
00:39:20,151 --> 00:39:22,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I've actually got promo for the prototype.

684
00:39:23,472 --> 00:39:28,873
[SPEAKER_05]: They did... And they put these out, I think, at one of the classic gaming conventions, which I want to go to in Vegas.

685
00:39:30,394 --> 00:39:33,995
[SPEAKER_05]: But they... I think it's Classic Gaming Expo is the one that's in Vegas every year.

686
00:39:34,435 --> 00:39:35,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I hell want to go to that.

687
00:39:35,955 --> 00:39:36,475
[SPEAKER_14]: When is that?

688
00:39:37,036 --> 00:39:39,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't... I think it's in August is when it's coming up.

689
00:39:39,716 --> 00:39:41,357
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope it's not the same weekend as Cyber Beat Nation 2.

690
00:39:42,077 --> 00:39:42,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

691
00:39:43,357 --> 00:39:44,798
[SPEAKER_05]: But... Well, anyway...

692
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:48,894
[SPEAKER_05]: They have prototype games.

693
00:39:48,914 --> 00:39:50,776
[SPEAKER_05]: They've actually cartridge-ized and everything.

694
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:52,377
[SPEAKER_05]: And this guy sold them on eBay.

695
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:59,302
[SPEAKER_05]: We picked up Super Pac-Man, which is my favorite Pac-Man game.

696
00:39:59,342 --> 00:39:59,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I agree.

697
00:40:00,003 --> 00:40:01,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Super Pac-Man is the best Pac-Man game.

698
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:02,925
[SPEAKER_05]: And we picked up Millipede.

699
00:40:04,727 --> 00:40:05,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a trackball.

700
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:06,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, cool.

701
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:10,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing beats playing Millipede on a 5200 with a trackball.

702
00:40:11,026 --> 00:40:14,627
[SPEAKER_05]: There's very few experiences that are as beautiful as that.

703
00:40:15,387 --> 00:40:16,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Except playing kicks.

704
00:40:16,508 --> 00:40:19,068
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a quick Bomani-related question when it comes to Atari 2600.

705
00:40:19,688 --> 00:40:22,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Wasn't somebody trying to develop Dance Dance Revolution for the 2600?

706
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:23,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

707
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:24,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever happened with that?

708
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, you probably follow that stuff better than any of us.

709
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:31,692
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's because people still program for the 2600 for I don't know what reason.

710
00:40:31,852 --> 00:40:32,732
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's fun.

711
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:36,533
[SPEAKER_12]: They were trying to create like a sort of Dance Dance Revolution type game.

712
00:40:37,037 --> 00:40:46,804
[SPEAKER_12]: And the problem is they had to do it horizontally instead of vertically because I guess the vertical refresh rate isn't as fast as the horizontal refresh rate or something like that.

713
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:49,086
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like playing Beatmania on the WonderSwan.

714
00:40:53,729 --> 00:40:54,350
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you were saying?

715
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:58,192
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, so yeah, I don't think that it ever went anywhere.

716
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:00,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Know what I want to get?

717
00:41:01,074 --> 00:41:03,216
[SPEAKER_12]: They have for your cell phones...

718
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:06,781
[SPEAKER_12]: Or for certain cell phones, you know how you can put games on there?

719
00:41:06,961 --> 00:41:07,682
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, pump it up.

720
00:41:08,682 --> 00:41:09,923
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I heard about that.

721
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:12,004
[SPEAKER_14]: But I couldn't find where you download it.

722
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,606
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's only for Korean cell phones.

723
00:41:14,626 --> 00:41:16,648
[SPEAKER_05]: There's pictures on one of the DDR Live Journal things.

724
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,490
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm too lazy to go look them up.

725
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Triscuits are garlicky.

726
00:41:22,912 --> 00:41:23,812
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we need to take a break.

727
00:41:24,493 --> 00:41:25,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's take a quick break.

728
00:41:25,354 --> 00:41:28,816
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do a break and this is... They still have the memory of cheese attached to them.

729
00:41:29,096 --> 00:41:31,197
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to play some 9th style songs this break.

730
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,319
[SPEAKER_14]: So the quality of the MP3s is kind of eh.

731
00:41:34,457 --> 00:41:37,678
[SPEAKER_14]: But you guys might enjoy these anyway.

732
00:41:37,738 --> 00:41:41,559
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a free preview here of what's coming up on Night Style.

733
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:43,600
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to play the following songs.

734
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:49,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Emotion, 2003, Romantic Extra, Abyss, Let's Say Hello, and Distress.

735
00:41:49,721 --> 00:41:52,602
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to hear all those fabulous Night Style songs.

736
00:41:52,642 --> 00:41:53,322
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we'll be back.

737
00:41:54,343 --> 00:41:55,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Sound like a plan.

738
00:41:56,663 --> 00:41:56,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Word.

739
00:41:57,183 --> 00:41:58,644
[SPEAKER_14]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

740
00:41:59,565 --> 00:42:06,471
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to join in the fun in the chat room, and they're all reminiscing about classic video games right now, I'm seeing all these great games being named right now.

741
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:16,379
[SPEAKER_14]: Adventure, Beachhead, Mule, or I should say M-U-L-E, Warlord, Combat, anyway.

742
00:42:18,721 --> 00:42:21,022
[SPEAKER_14]: So we will be right back after some Night Style MP3s.

743
00:42:21,042 --> 00:42:25,406
[SPEAKER_14]: So the quality of these is kind of eh, but it will give you an impression of what you can look forward to very soon.

744
00:42:26,448 --> 00:42:27,409
[SPEAKER_14]: we'll be back

745

00:47:21,678 --> 00:47:22,718
Thank you for watching!

DarkSakura

753
00:50:07,677 --> 00:50:10,039
[SPEAKER_09]: It's more contagious than SARS.

754
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,361
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Orange Lounge Radio.

755
00:50:16,002 --> 00:50:16,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Howdy.

756
00:50:17,023 --> 00:50:17,463
[SPEAKER_05]: We're back.

757
00:50:18,004 --> 00:50:18,424
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you?

758
00:50:19,024 --> 00:50:19,705
[SPEAKER_05]: SARS-erific.

759
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,767
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope you enjoyed those 9th style preview songs.

760
00:50:22,827 --> 00:50:26,809
[SPEAKER_14]: I know the quality was a little poopy, but, you know, they always are at first.

761
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:29,231
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm surprised we haven't had better ones by this point yet, though.

762
00:50:30,532 --> 00:50:32,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so happy about the second to last one.

763
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,194
[SPEAKER_14]: The Let's Say Hello?

764
00:50:34,514 --> 00:50:34,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh.

765
00:50:34,954 --> 00:50:35,475
[SPEAKER_05]: That one is cool.

766
00:50:35,495 --> 00:50:35,935
[SPEAKER_05]: That song's cute.

767
00:50:36,371 --> 00:50:38,332
[SPEAKER_14]: It sounds worthy of, like, poppin' music-ness.

768
00:50:38,352 --> 00:50:39,433
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me think of Murmur Twins.

769
00:50:41,434 --> 00:50:42,355
[SPEAKER_14]: You think it's the same group?

770
00:50:42,455 --> 00:50:43,055
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it is.

771
00:50:43,535 --> 00:50:44,896
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it just makes me think of Murmur Twins.

772
00:50:46,497 --> 00:50:48,618
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know who did that, and I'm too lazy to look it up right now.

773
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:51,980
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we're back.

774
00:50:52,781 --> 00:50:53,922
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, how are you?

775
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,003
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to think.

776
00:50:57,784 --> 00:50:58,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hazelnutty.

777
00:50:59,025 --> 00:50:59,625
[SPEAKER_05]: And garlicky.

778
00:51:00,806 --> 00:51:03,227
[SPEAKER_14]: I noticed Loki's working on some things over there.

779
00:51:03,387 --> 00:51:04,348
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to do the cage match?

780
00:51:05,441 --> 00:51:06,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, did I bring a song?

781
00:51:07,402 --> 00:51:08,183
[SPEAKER_14]: You did bring a song.

782
00:51:08,443 --> 00:51:09,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I forgot if I did.

783
00:51:09,444 --> 00:51:09,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, you did.

784
00:51:09,864 --> 00:51:11,806
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, we're going to do the cage match.

785
00:51:12,226 --> 00:51:17,350
[SPEAKER_14]: So, because we usually don't do the cage match early in the show, we're just going to throw people through the loop.

786
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:18,490
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the last week you can win.

787
00:51:19,891 --> 00:51:21,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Has he been four weeks?

788
00:51:21,693 --> 00:51:21,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

789
00:51:22,293 --> 00:51:23,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yes, this will be the fourth week.

790
00:51:24,435 --> 00:51:27,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Because Mona Lisa Overdrive had two weeks the first time because of B3.

791
00:51:27,457 --> 00:51:29,759
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, we've got more people here.

792
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:30,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello.

793
00:51:30,859 --> 00:51:31,600
[SPEAKER_05]: It's men.

794
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, boys and girls.

795
00:51:33,942 --> 00:51:34,442
[SPEAKER_14]: It's men.

796
00:51:35,023 --> 00:51:36,304
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, sorry, I dropped your Triscuits.

797
00:51:37,104 --> 00:51:37,804
[SPEAKER_14]: It's men's?

798
00:51:39,525 --> 00:51:40,966
[SPEAKER_14]: We are the men's in this house.

799
00:51:41,526 --> 00:51:47,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, the topic we were talking about before you guys got here, I know Matt maybe has something to contribute, because he used to play Evercrack.

800
00:51:48,329 --> 00:51:49,729
[SPEAKER_14]: We were just talking about that.

801
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:55,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Funny, no, funny online gaming stories, and I already told the one about you telling people in Ragnarok you had SARS.

802
00:51:56,512 --> 00:51:57,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

803
00:51:58,773 --> 00:51:58,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

804
00:51:59,736 --> 00:52:02,198
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, speaking of which, Jamie just asked me if I'm paying to play.

805
00:52:02,878 --> 00:52:06,421
[SPEAKER_14]: They just... Okay, we just spent like a half hour talking about Ragnarok, so make it quick.

806
00:52:06,521 --> 00:52:07,242
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be quick.

807
00:52:07,662 --> 00:52:12,786
[SPEAKER_14]: For those, if there's anybody who's interested or is playing, they did today shut off the servers to get ready for pay-to-play.

808
00:52:12,826 --> 00:52:13,726
[SPEAKER_14]: It did just come back up.

809
00:52:14,247 --> 00:52:19,731
[SPEAKER_14]: And instead of being 12,000 people on the server with lots of lag, there's 2,400 people on the server with no lag.

810
00:52:19,771 --> 00:52:23,773
[SPEAKER_14]: We had an update from Aaron who says 3,800 people are logged into Chaos right now.

811
00:52:23,954 --> 00:52:25,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki's a little less people.

812
00:52:26,275 --> 00:52:28,457
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn, it's... There's less people on you, Loki.

813
00:52:28,477 --> 00:52:28,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn.

814
00:52:29,591 --> 00:52:31,332
[SPEAKER_12]: I have lots of people on me.

815
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:56,469
[SPEAKER_14]: who was going to give away the armor said just kidding and ran off.

816
00:52:56,689 --> 00:52:58,129
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, no.

817
00:52:58,449 --> 00:53:00,490
[SPEAKER_15]: That wasn't funny though.

818
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:04,351
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the classes has the ability to warp people places.

819
00:53:04,871 --> 00:53:11,413
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, when people got wins that they were going to be going pay to play, like 50 or more percent of the people who played the beta didn't like that.

820
00:53:11,793 --> 00:53:14,514
[SPEAKER_14]: So they started warping people to places where they can't get out of it.

821
00:53:15,574 --> 00:53:17,735
[SPEAKER_14]: And they did that to me, the Christmas Village.

822
00:53:17,755 --> 00:53:21,336
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a fly wing too, but it took me 10 minutes to realize I had one.

823
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:27,482
[SPEAKER_14]: And so they were sitting there, and I took screen captures, and I was like, I'm going to report you guys to Gravity, and you're going to get kicked off the server.

824
00:53:27,522 --> 00:53:29,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Fifteen minutes ago called, your topic arrived.

825
00:53:29,843 --> 00:53:30,424
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just kidding.

826
00:53:30,444 --> 00:53:31,665
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

827
00:53:31,785 --> 00:53:32,505
[SPEAKER_14]: I just got here.

828
00:53:32,685 --> 00:53:33,746
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just kidding.

829
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:36,047
[SPEAKER_14]: I am go-good-not-this.

830
00:53:37,428 --> 00:53:39,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Matt, do you have any Evercrack stories that are funny?

831
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:40,811
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

832
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:41,571
[SPEAKER_05]: One more little thing.

833
00:53:41,771 --> 00:53:42,031
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

834
00:53:42,111 --> 00:53:46,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I freaking got warped to five different locations in a row, and they sent me to Glass Time.

835
00:53:47,935 --> 00:53:48,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate Glass Time.

836
00:53:48,796 --> 00:53:50,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate Glass Time.

837
00:53:52,205 --> 00:53:53,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Eat Electric Death.

838
00:53:54,507 --> 00:53:57,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, greatest video game quote ever.

839
00:53:57,831 --> 00:53:58,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

840
00:53:59,652 --> 00:54:00,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Guess what, boys and girls?

841
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:05,198
[SPEAKER_14]: It's time for the Orange Lounge Cage Match.

842
00:54:06,759 --> 00:54:13,546
[SPEAKER_14]: This is where I put a song in, and Loki puts a song in, and Jamie puts a song in, and they do battle.

843
00:54:14,106 --> 00:54:16,569
[SPEAKER_14]: They get naked and roll around and romp with each other.

844
00:54:18,127 --> 00:54:24,629
[SPEAKER_14]: and the winning song chosen by your votes in the chat room goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.

845
00:54:25,109 --> 00:54:28,670
[SPEAKER_14]: So, let's start it off with the reigning champion, Loki's pick.

846
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:37,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Three weeks, actually only two shows victorious, but since we had no show the weekend of B3, it's been victorious for three weeks now.

847
00:54:37,712 --> 00:54:44,854
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is the last time it can win, and this will be the very first four-week rotated song, if this won.

848
00:54:45,334 --> 00:54:45,554
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

849
00:54:46,334 --> 00:54:49,217
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's a clip of Loki's song.

850
00:54:50,238 --> 00:54:51,059
[SPEAKER_12]: You want to introduce us?

851
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:57,765
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Don Davis and Juno Reactor with Mona Lisa Overdrive from the Matrix Reloaded movie.

852
00:54:58,646 --> 00:55:02,489
[SPEAKER_14]: And since it is last week's winner, you only get to hear a clip.

853
00:55:02,589 --> 00:55:03,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, kids.

854
00:55:04,071 --> 00:55:06,353
[SPEAKER_14]: So here's a clip of Mona Lisa Overdrive.

855
00:56:39,352 --> 00:56:43,875
[SPEAKER_14]: Then there's a clip of last week's winner, Mona Lisa Overdrive.

856
00:56:44,015 --> 00:56:44,515
[SPEAKER_14]: Beautiful.

857
00:56:45,115 --> 00:56:48,317
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, the next entry tonight comes from Jamie.

858
00:56:48,337 --> 00:56:50,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine's going to annoy the hell out of Matt.

859
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:51,279
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so tell us.

860
00:56:51,299 --> 00:56:52,320
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something Speed Mix.

861
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:53,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh-oh.

862
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:54,541
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, God, it's a Speed Mix.

863
00:56:54,741 --> 00:56:55,541
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, tell us about it.

864
00:56:56,082 --> 00:56:56,782
[SPEAKER_05]: It's September.

865
00:56:56,802 --> 00:56:58,863
[SPEAKER_05]: It's old school stuff.

866
00:56:59,083 --> 00:56:59,644
[SPEAKER_14]: It's old school.

867
00:56:59,664 --> 00:57:00,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's it by?

868
00:57:00,404 --> 00:57:00,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

869
00:57:01,105 --> 00:57:03,686
[SPEAKER_14]: DJ Speedo with September, the Speedo Mix.

870
00:57:03,886 --> 00:57:05,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I got this one from JB.

871
00:57:05,587 --> 00:57:06,067
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, God.

872
00:57:06,668 --> 00:57:08,729
[SPEAKER_05]: But I like the song anyway because I like the original song.

873
00:57:09,537 --> 00:57:10,158
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, sounds good.

874
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,100
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is Jamie's pick for this week.

875
00:57:12,141 --> 00:57:15,184
[SPEAKER_14]: And since it's a new entry, you get to hear the whole five minute long version.

876
00:57:15,244 --> 00:57:15,605
[SPEAKER_14]: Here it is.

877
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:18,589
[SPEAKER_14]: DJ Speedo with September, the Speedo Mix.

878
00:57:18,649 --> 00:57:20,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie's pick for the cage match this week.

879
00:57:20,611 --> 00:57:20,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Enjoy.

880
00:58:10,117 --> 00:58:11,658
Remember, it's when it's the time.

881
00:58:11,758 --> 00:58:13,339
Remember, love will change in your mind.

882
00:58:13,379 --> 00:58:15,060
Remember, while I'm taking the sound away.

883
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:17,601
Our hearts are ringing, looking out for what we're saying.

884
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:19,262
At the dance of the night.

885
00:58:19,302 --> 00:58:21,503
Remember, how the stars all night away.

886
01:00:19,854 --> 01:00:20,680
Thanks for watching!

887
01:00:35,078 --> 01:00:35,919
DarkSakura.com

888
01:01:18,553 --> 01:01:19,194
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

889
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:41,751
[SPEAKER_14]: DJ Speedo there with September.

890
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:46,335
[SPEAKER_14]: That's DarkSakura's pick for the Sex-Tember.

891
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:50,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I was about to leave the house, and I couldn't find a song.

892
01:02:50,838 --> 01:02:54,481
[SPEAKER_05]: So I picked September, because I like the song.

893
01:02:54,861 --> 01:02:55,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the original.

894
01:02:55,762 --> 01:02:56,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

895
01:02:56,536 --> 01:03:01,219
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the speed mix okay, I give it an upper level 8, barely a 9.

896
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Upper level 8, barely a 9 from Jamie.

897
01:03:03,561 --> 01:03:10,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, I give it a 2 because it's a speed mix and I hate speed mixes and everything.

898
01:03:10,706 --> 01:03:11,927
[SPEAKER_12]: I hate speed mixes.

899
01:03:12,287 --> 01:03:15,489
[SPEAKER_12]: God damn it, it's not a new song, you just sped up the old one.

900
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:16,310
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop it.

901
01:03:17,931 --> 01:03:23,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I would give that song like, I don't know, okay, this is my problem with speed mixes.

902
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:27,831
[SPEAKER_14]: DDR size, like a minute and a half, two minutes, they're awesome.

903
01:03:27,851 --> 01:03:30,372
[SPEAKER_14]: They're cool, they're fun, they're cheesy to dance to, they're great.

904
01:03:30,912 --> 01:03:31,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Five minutes long?

905
01:03:32,593 --> 01:03:33,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Joke's old.

906
01:03:34,133 --> 01:03:36,674
[SPEAKER_14]: So, if that were two minutes long, I'd give it like an eight.

907
01:03:36,734 --> 01:03:39,655
[SPEAKER_14]: But since it's five minutes long, I'm going to have it and give it a four.

908
01:03:42,556 --> 01:03:44,117
[SPEAKER_14]: But I do, I like the original too.

909
01:03:45,517 --> 01:03:46,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, the original was good.

910
01:03:46,578 --> 01:03:47,538
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the original.

911
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,939
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the original, but no.

912
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:51,779
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

913
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:53,520
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

914
01:03:54,085 --> 01:04:01,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Matt, the Ice Prince, or Ice Queen, whatever we're calling you We have the Rice Princess and the Ice Princess Yeah, Ice Princess works, I like that better than Ice Queen

915
01:04:02,526 --> 01:04:04,047
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not that dramatic, bitch.

916
01:04:04,347 --> 01:04:04,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

917
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:07,709
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, no, I have to give that about a six.

918
01:04:07,749 --> 01:04:09,230
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, Rob made a good point.

919
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:11,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Five minutes is a little too long for a speed mix.

920
01:04:12,071 --> 01:04:18,555
[SPEAKER_13]: It just gets repetitive, so... Well, depends on how you're... Well, never mind.

921
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:18,935
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

922
01:04:19,315 --> 01:04:20,356
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I give it a six.

923
01:04:20,376 --> 01:04:29,861
[SPEAKER_12]: The problem is it goes so fast that really you're listening to about 15 minutes worth of music in that little five minute, you know, spot, so... Loki makes a damn good point.

924
01:04:30,401 --> 01:04:31,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Listen up, everybody.

925
01:04:32,232 --> 01:04:33,053
[SPEAKER_14]: Irene, you have something to say?

926
01:04:33,213 --> 01:04:34,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I agree.

927
01:04:34,734 --> 01:04:40,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I give it a 6 too, because I'm really burnt out on speed mixes, especially all the crap that you play on Orange Lounge.

928
01:04:41,019 --> 01:04:42,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that you need to take off.

929
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:45,222
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, 6, yeah, whatever.

930
01:04:46,102 --> 01:04:50,205
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Brad, there are only three good speed songs in this world.

931
01:04:50,546 --> 01:04:56,810
[SPEAKER_15]: Can't Stop Falling In Love, If You Were Here With Me Before The Beat, and the Aerosmith Jaded song.

932
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:58,992
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's not that, it's not good, it's a 2.

933
01:05:00,242 --> 01:05:01,983
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's a one.

934
01:05:04,305 --> 01:05:04,585
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

935
01:05:06,066 --> 01:05:09,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, there was a speed mix that won the cage match one time.

936
01:05:10,389 --> 01:05:11,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it was heaven is a place on earth.

937
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:16,173
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I think the general public would tend to disagree with you, Mr. Brad.

938
01:05:18,655 --> 01:05:20,516
[SPEAKER_14]: The general public doesn't matter.

939
01:05:21,697 --> 01:05:22,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Because they're all retards.

940
01:05:22,838 --> 01:05:23,999
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't play Ragnarok online.

941
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:26,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie knows what I'm talking about.

942
01:05:27,944 --> 01:05:29,265
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, can we get on to my pick now?

943
01:05:29,285 --> 01:05:30,746
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they don't need to play rock and roll.

944
01:05:30,766 --> 01:05:33,887
[SPEAKER_05]: My pick, my pick, my pick time.

945
01:05:34,728 --> 01:05:36,029
[SPEAKER_14]: My pick time, it's my pick time.

946
01:05:36,049 --> 01:05:37,349
[SPEAKER_14]: Fine, go, God.

947
01:05:37,369 --> 01:05:43,953
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, who remembers, like, about three months ago when I put in a song by Kylie Minogue called Your Disco Needs You?

948
01:05:45,534 --> 01:05:46,815
[SPEAKER_14]: And everybody wanted to kill me?

949
01:05:47,295 --> 01:05:51,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this is the Kylie song that people said I should have put in instead.

950
01:05:52,058 --> 01:05:57,221
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is, I'll admit it, it's a much better Kylie song, and if any Kylie song were to win the cage match, it should be this one.

951
01:05:57,822 --> 01:06:02,126
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's very cute, and it's very danceable, and it'll be great in a Pomadi game, and it's got a great video.

952
01:06:02,206 --> 01:06:04,008
[SPEAKER_14]: It's got a wonderful video to it.

953
01:06:04,849 --> 01:06:06,170
[SPEAKER_14]: But you can't see it, because it's radio.

954
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:06,471
[SPEAKER_14]: Ha!

955
01:06:07,151 --> 01:06:09,273
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Kylie Minogue with Come Into My World.

956
01:06:09,313 --> 01:06:10,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this song.

957
01:06:10,114 --> 01:06:11,575
[SPEAKER_14]: This is my pick for this week's Big Red.

958
01:06:11,595 --> 01:06:12,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this song, and I hope you win.

959
01:06:13,918 --> 01:06:15,059
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, here it is.

960
01:06:15,159 --> 01:06:15,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Enjoy.

961
01:10:47,264 --> 01:10:48,205
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, boys and girls.

962
01:10:50,106 --> 01:10:52,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Kylie Minogue with Come Into My World.

963
01:10:53,608 --> 01:10:54,668
[SPEAKER_14]: What did y'all think of that one?

964
01:10:55,729 --> 01:10:58,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie's in the facilities right now, so we'll start with Irene.

965
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:00,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I like Kylie.

966
01:11:00,851 --> 01:11:02,072
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a pretty good one.

967
01:11:02,132 --> 01:11:03,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I give it an 8.

968
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:06,474
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd rather hear In Your Eyes, but that one's pretty good.

969
01:11:06,754 --> 01:11:07,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe another time.

970
01:11:07,395 --> 01:11:09,436
[SPEAKER_14]: In another three months, I'll do In Your Eyes.

971
01:11:09,936 --> 01:11:10,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

972
01:11:10,316 --> 01:11:10,616
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

973
01:11:10,636 --> 01:11:11,977
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you giving us?

974
01:11:11,997 --> 01:11:12,157
[SPEAKER_14]: 1 to 10?

975
01:11:12,257 --> 01:11:12,157
8?

976
01:11:12,277 --> 01:11:14,718
[SPEAKER_14]: You're giving an 8?

977
01:11:15,019 --> 01:11:15,319
[SPEAKER_07]: An 8, yeah.

978
01:11:15,459 --> 01:11:15,719
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

979
01:11:18,169 --> 01:11:19,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoever grabs the mic next.

980
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:20,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie.

981
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:21,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Eight.

982
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:22,891
[SPEAKER_14]: Brad.

983
01:11:24,251 --> 01:11:31,974
[SPEAKER_14]: I give it an eight, too, because I like the song a lot, but... I'm not a huge Kylie fan.

984
01:11:34,055 --> 01:11:34,375
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

985
01:11:34,496 --> 01:11:34,816
[SPEAKER_15]: Fine.

986
01:11:35,036 --> 01:11:35,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Kill me.

987
01:11:35,376 --> 01:11:35,996
[SPEAKER_14]: Kick me out of here.

988
01:11:36,997 --> 01:11:37,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Be gone!

989
01:11:37,557 --> 01:11:38,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Just beat me up now!

990
01:11:39,117 --> 01:11:39,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Please!

991
01:11:39,838 --> 01:11:40,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Ice Queen.

992
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Ice Slut, Ice Slut.

993
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:46,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, no, that was only last night.

994
01:11:48,662 --> 01:11:49,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, boy.

995
01:11:49,622 --> 01:11:50,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

996
01:11:51,043 --> 01:11:57,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, if that was anything like the other song that you were playing, I was going to have to tell somebody to go get a rope so we could hang you by your freaking toes from the ceiling.

997
01:11:58,065 --> 01:11:59,085
[SPEAKER_13]: But, no, that was a good one.

998
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:00,026
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that song a lot.

999
01:12:00,266 --> 01:12:00,966
[SPEAKER_13]: I give that a nine.

1000
01:12:02,367 --> 01:12:02,727
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

1001
01:12:02,827 --> 01:12:03,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki.

1002
01:12:05,248 --> 01:12:09,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, you know, that sounded like every other fucking song that she sings.

1003
01:12:09,969 --> 01:12:11,890
[SPEAKER_12]: Gee, um... Hmm...

1004
01:12:12,735 --> 01:12:19,237
[SPEAKER_12]: Since I've heard it before, you know, I'm going to have to say that I'm going to give it a zero because it sucks ass.

1005
01:12:20,118 --> 01:12:23,039
[SPEAKER_12]: And, no, actually, no, Kylie's alright, but that song sucks.

1006
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:26,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously, she has done much better stuff than that song.

1007
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:35,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have to decrease mine, okay, because last weekend when Maren and I had lunch in San Francisco, they played nothing but Kylie Minogue.

1008
01:12:36,643 --> 01:12:41,105
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I was there the weekend before while all of you were at the tourney and I went to go get lunch.

1009
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:45,451
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was when Megumi-chan and I were having lunch and they were playing Kylie.

1010
01:12:45,972 --> 01:12:48,653
[SPEAKER_05]: So I dropped my note 6.

1011
01:12:49,153 --> 01:12:51,414
[SPEAKER_14]: Just out of bitterness.

1012
01:12:51,434 --> 01:12:57,457
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to retort Loki's argument and say that that song sounds nothing like I should be so lucky in love.

1013
01:12:58,357 --> 01:13:00,838
[SPEAKER_14]: I should be so lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.

1014
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:05,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on.

1015
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,301
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't sound like the locomotion.

1016
01:13:07,421 --> 01:13:07,701
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

1017
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:10,091
[SPEAKER_14]: I give it a 10, it's fabulous.

1018
01:13:11,613 --> 01:13:12,494
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, here we go.

1019
01:13:12,994 --> 01:13:14,055
[SPEAKER_14]: You can send your votes now.

1020
01:13:14,115 --> 01:13:16,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's a quick recap of the songs in tonight's cage match.

[SPEAKER_14]: Pick number one, last week's winner, three weeks winner, Mona Lisa Overdrive from the Matrix 2.

1022
01:13:28,168 --> 01:13:30,070
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a shitty clip of the song, I'm gonna play a different clip.

1023
01:13:38,337 --> 01:13:45,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, pick number two, DJ Speedo with September And pick number three, Kylie Minogue, Come Into My World

[SPEAKER_14]: And you send those over private MSG.

1029
01:14:08,627 --> 01:14:09,868
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, wait.

1030
01:14:09,888 --> 01:14:10,349
[SPEAKER_13]: What, Matt?

1031
01:14:10,469 --> 01:14:11,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Come into my eye.

1032
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:15,714

[SPEAKER_14]: And if you want to send in your vote, you've got to get in our chat room.

[SPEAKER_14]: Show the world you love Orange Lounge.

1040
01:14:52,191 --> 01:14:52,511
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1041
01:14:52,711 --> 01:14:54,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh, my screen is filling up with votes for the cage match.

1042
01:14:54,752 --> 01:14:56,073
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to have to go count those in a little bit.

1043
01:14:57,014 --> 01:15:00,636
[SPEAKER_14]: In the meantime, what else do you kids want to talk about today?

1044
01:15:00,856 --> 01:15:02,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have a sim update for Loki?

1045
01:15:02,657 --> 01:15:03,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki's been awfully quiet.

1046
01:15:03,718 --> 01:15:04,639
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Kylie scared him.

1047
01:15:04,679 --> 01:15:06,460
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's wake him up with a sim update.

1048
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:10,782
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I want to know where my freaking Dancy Stage Party Edition stuff went.

1049
01:15:10,822 --> 01:15:12,263
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like disappeared off my computer.

1050
01:15:12,483 --> 01:15:12,864
[SPEAKER_12]: That's weird.

1051
01:15:13,004 --> 01:15:13,224
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway...

1052
01:15:14,251 --> 01:15:19,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, there's a new, uh, CVS, um, update for Stepmania.

1053
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:21,455
[SPEAKER_12]: It was just updated yesterday, I believe.

1054
01:15:22,116 --> 01:15:22,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, pretty nice.

1055
01:15:22,896 --> 01:15:24,037
[SPEAKER_12]: I was playing with that earlier.

1056
01:15:24,317 --> 01:15:27,238
[SPEAKER_12]: They've got a bunch of new modifiers they added in there, which is pretty cool.

1057
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:29,680
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they've also, um, done some other things.

1058
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:32,581
[SPEAKER_12]: They added a few things where you can adjust the pitch of the song.

1059
01:15:33,082 --> 01:15:35,123
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, before it used to be limited just to .07, or .7.

1060
01:15:35,383 --> 01:15:38,725
[SPEAKER_12]: Now you can go all the way down to .3, which makes the song sound...

1061
01:15:39,561 --> 01:15:58,759
[SPEAKER_12]: Really bad, but if you really want to practice or something, that's pretty good for you And it loads really nice, so go check that one out And if you haven't checked out, there's a new DWI version, 2.49 or whatever But I don't play DWI because it's inferior, so go check that one out too Now as for other updates, let's see here

1062
01:16:00,066 --> 01:16:09,692
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, check my money sims, because, uh, Uber, or, Utterdude, or whatever, that guy is releasing a lot of cool stuff, and pretty much all of his step files kick ass, and they're just really playable, so go play those.

1063
01:16:10,473 --> 01:16:20,299
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and, uh, other than that, I have the second most, um, DWIs on the internet, other than, uh, Shoei, which has, you know, 5,000, but I have 3,000 and something now, so, yay!

1064
01:16:21,259 --> 01:16:25,602
[SPEAKER_12]: I would have 5,000 if I put every single one that he has in there, because I have all his, um...

1065
01:16:26,366 --> 01:16:28,146
[SPEAKER_12]: I was telling Cage Match votes, I'm sorry.

1066
01:16:28,186 --> 01:16:29,006
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, show.

1067

1076
01:17:21,961 --> 01:17:23,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever's cheaper, yeah, you can take my car

1077
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:25,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I gotta go get cash back first.

01:17:25,259 --> 01:17:27,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you get me one of those Cheesecake McFlurries while you're out?

1079
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:27,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, fuck you.

1080
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:31,561
[SPEAKER_14]: See, this is why I need things on the radio, because I need food from McDonald's too.

1081
01:17:32,401 --> 01:17:34,822
[SPEAKER_14]: Our listeners really want to hear about the food we provide.

1082
01:17:34,902 --> 01:17:35,662
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they do.

1083

[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1084
01:17:39,203 --> 01:17:41,863

1087
01:17:44,704 --> 01:17:48,425
[SPEAKER_14]: No, don't get them mixed up with the K-Med votes.

1088
01:17:48,765 --> 01:17:52,326
[SPEAKER_14]: For a limited time only, they have the Strawberry Cheesecake McFlurries.

1089
01:17:52,864 --> 01:17:53,825
[SPEAKER_05]: For a limited time.

1090
01:17:54,085 --> 01:17:55,105
[SPEAKER_14]: For a limited time only.

1091
01:17:55,125 --> 01:17:58,928
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay, because I'm just going to go eat a sandwich at my house after the show.

1092
01:18:00,128 --> 01:18:01,329
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to go eat a sandwich?

01:18:43,348 --> 01:18:44,649
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you getting frustrated about?

1108
01:18:45,569 --> 01:18:48,710
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm missing step files and my programs just disappeared on my taskbar.

1109
01:18:49,671 --> 01:18:49,931

[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't done one in forever.

1116
01:19:08,587 --> 01:19:09,307
[SPEAKER_14]: We haven't done one in forever.

1117
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:10,228
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the first one of the house.

1118
01:19:10,488 --> 01:19:13,490
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do a list list when we get back, since there will only be four of us here, right?

1119
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:15,891
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm taking a nap.

1120
01:19:15,911 --> 01:19:16,812
[SPEAKER_14]: What list list topic?

1121
01:19:17,192 --> 01:19:18,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll think of one.

1122
01:19:18,726 --> 01:19:20,287
[SPEAKER_14]: I will solicit ideas from the chat room.

1123
01:19:20,327 --> 01:19:22,008

01:19:27,853 --> 01:19:28,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Top of cool anime.

01:19:28,673 --> 01:19:31,135

1128
01:19:31,155 --> 01:19:31,756
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we never have.

1129
01:19:31,796 --> 01:19:34,978
[SPEAKER_14]: How about worst Bomani game?

1130
01:19:35,218 --> 01:19:36,619
[SPEAKER_14]: That'd be Marshall Beat.

1131
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:37,820
[SPEAKER_14]: There's probably not enough.

1132
01:19:38,761 --> 01:19:40,462
[SPEAKER_14]: We could do worst video game.

1133
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:43,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Did we do worst video game?

1134
01:19:43,384 --> 01:19:43,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

01:19:44,305 --> 01:19:44,745

[SPEAKER_14]: I was watching this show on there today.

1143
01:20:06,846 --> 01:20:08,447

[SPEAKER_14]: Which one?

1145
01:20:10,948 --> 01:20:12,049
[SPEAKER_14]: The 10 play.

01:20:14,847 --> 01:20:18,850
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah, Timplay, I think that's what it's called or something like that.

1148
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:20,231
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a top ten show.

1149
01:20:21,071 --> 01:20:26,836
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and they were doing top ten most, like, changing video games of all time.

[SPEAKER_14]: Like, video games that change the scene of all time.

1151
01:20:28,957 --> 01:20:30,638
[SPEAKER_14]: Arcade games that change the scene of all time.

01:20:30,718 --> 01:20:30,878
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

1153
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:33,820

1154
01:20:34,421 --> 01:20:34,901
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1159
01:20:47,054 --> 01:20:49,174
[SPEAKER_14]: But number 8 was Dance Dance Revolution.

01:22:28,695 --> 01:22:30,496
[SPEAKER_05]: As in Drivin' in, of course, a Naoki song.

1204
01:22:31,097 --> 01:22:32,838
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so we've done seven style songs.

1205
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:35,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Night Style Phones, I guess we'll do Eight Style Phones now.

1206
01:22:35,481 --> 01:22:39,003
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to do, uh, Drive-In, if I have it.

1207
01:22:39,263 --> 01:22:40,243
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if I have it.

1208
01:22:44,105 --> 01:22:45,186
[SPEAKER_14]: I swear I do somewhere.

1209
01:22:45,206 --> 01:22:46,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I got it, I got it.

1210
01:22:47,307 --> 01:22:48,227
[SPEAKER_14]: I got it, na-na-na.

1211
01:22:48,467 --> 01:22:57,331

[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Lucy.

1234
01:31:00,952 --> 01:31:02,912
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to throw that thing in the river.

1235
01:31:03,873 --> 01:31:04,653
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you know what?

1236
01:31:05,317 --> 01:31:05,397
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

1237
01:31:05,417 --> 01:31:05,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Prison.

1238
01:31:05,597 --> 01:31:05,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Prison!

1239
01:31:05,838 --> 01:31:05,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Prison!

1240
01:31:28,786 --> 01:31:29,806
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's why rent's cheap.

1241
01:31:30,086 --> 01:31:37,429
[SPEAKER_14]: We're next to the dam, which is a big terrorist target, and we're right on the other side of the prison, so if there's ever a prison break... Next week's Orange Lounge will be hosted from my house.

1242
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:39,790
[SPEAKER_14]: And all future weeks.

01:31:42,051 --> 01:31:42,391
[SPEAKER_14]: It's fine.

1244
01:31:43,751 --> 01:31:51,834
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, they're saying in the chat room that the ferret, or now it's the coyote or whatever that thing is... Yeah, I like talking to the coyote.

1245
01:31:52,474 --> 01:31:54,755
[SPEAKER_14]: It sounds like one of the animals from Happy Tree Friends.

1246
01:31:56,519 --> 01:31:58,019
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they say it sounds like Menchie.

1247
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Menchie flavor.

1248
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:00,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Mmm.

1249
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:02,521
[SPEAKER_14]: Mmm, delicious.

1250
01:32:03,061 --> 01:32:05,802
[SPEAKER_14]: So, wow, it's just the three of us here now.

1251
01:32:06,002 --> 01:32:06,762
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it's quiet.

1252
01:32:06,862 --> 01:32:07,702
[SPEAKER_05]: It's weird.

1253
01:32:07,762 --> 01:32:09,083
[SPEAKER_14]: You should have been here this week.

1254
01:32:10,083 --> 01:32:10,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

1255
01:32:10,563 --> 01:32:11,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Martin Chung should have been here this week.

1256
01:32:13,304 --> 01:32:14,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Less crowded.

1257
01:32:14,804 --> 01:32:15,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1258
01:32:15,344 --> 01:32:17,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Less chances to be claustrophobia-ed.

1259
01:32:18,625 --> 01:32:19,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Or catch SARS.

1260
01:32:19,665 --> 01:32:22,046
[SPEAKER_14]: Or catch SARS, yeah, because I still have it.

1261
01:32:22,086 --> 01:32:22,946
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember brain tumor?

1262
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:23,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1263
01:32:23,467 --> 01:32:24,307
[SPEAKER_14]: All at the same time?

1264
01:32:24,587 --> 01:32:25,107
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's awful.

1265
01:32:27,830 --> 01:32:31,971
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we want to talk shit about any of the other people that are on this show usually?

1266
01:32:32,011 --> 01:32:34,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what?

1267
01:32:34,672 --> 01:32:35,612
[SPEAKER_05]: That Brad.

1268
01:32:36,092 --> 01:32:36,812
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that Brad.

1269
01:32:37,012 --> 01:32:39,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Congesting the server all by himself that I don't even play on.

1270
01:32:39,652 --> 01:32:40,453
[SPEAKER_14]: He's so skinny.

1271
01:32:41,133 --> 01:32:41,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, what's up with that?

1272
01:32:42,013 --> 01:32:42,873
[SPEAKER_14]: And that ice queen.

1273
01:32:42,893 --> 01:32:43,493
[SPEAKER_14]: What a fag.

1274
01:32:44,433 --> 01:32:45,753
[SPEAKER_14]: And rice princess.

1275
01:32:46,134 --> 01:32:47,734
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't seen her eat rice in a year.

1276
01:32:48,474 --> 01:32:49,934
[SPEAKER_14]: How dare she call herself that?

1277
01:32:52,415 --> 01:32:52,995
[SPEAKER_14]: That reminds me.

1278
01:32:53,035 --> 01:32:54,135
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to use our rice cooker.

1279
01:32:55,785 --> 01:32:56,305
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1280
01:32:56,625 --> 01:32:56,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

1281
01:32:57,185 --> 01:32:58,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Dare the shit and it's time to flush.

1282
01:33:02,767 --> 01:33:03,668
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that?

1283
01:33:05,168 --> 01:33:05,968
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate being sick.

1284
01:33:05,988 --> 01:33:07,569
[SPEAKER_01]: God, let's give me good stars again.

1285
01:33:07,769 --> 01:33:09,029
[SPEAKER_14]: Every time I laugh, I cough.

1286
01:33:15,332 --> 01:33:17,072
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to beat that thing senseless.

1287
01:33:18,152 --> 01:33:18,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it to me.

1288
01:33:18,773 --> 01:33:18,893
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1289
01:33:19,173 --> 01:33:19,313
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1290
01:33:23,396 --> 01:33:23,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I know.

1291
01:33:24,197 --> 01:33:25,638
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought of a fun thing we could do.

1292
01:33:26,178 --> 01:33:31,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Since we were kind of making fun of G4 before the break, I thought maybe we could take a look at the list.

1293
01:33:31,402 --> 01:33:34,084
[SPEAKER_14]: And this can be like an ongoing thing because there's a lot to talk about here.

1294
01:33:34,524 --> 01:33:38,967
[SPEAKER_14]: We could talk about G4's list that they got together with the Entertainment Weekly.

1295
01:33:40,909 --> 01:33:42,450
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll just shut up and let that thing talk.

1296
01:33:46,293 --> 01:33:48,074
[SPEAKER_14]: I had to do the elementary school trick to make it work.

1297
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:50,241
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't do it!

1298
01:33:50,381 --> 01:33:52,321
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I gotta take that thing away.

1299
01:33:52,482 --> 01:33:53,042
[SPEAKER_14]: You see this?

1300
01:33:53,082 --> 01:33:53,642
[SPEAKER_14]: It's mine now.

1301
01:33:53,822 --> 01:33:54,602
[SPEAKER_14]: This is mine now.

1302
01:33:56,503 --> 01:33:56,823
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1303
01:34:01,005 --> 01:34:03,906
[SPEAKER_12]: They have an ass shot for the bad touch, that's sweet.

1304
01:34:05,147 --> 01:34:06,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that the official background?

1305
01:34:07,948 --> 01:34:08,408
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it is.

1306
01:34:08,428 --> 01:34:11,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Do they have the background for Can't Get You Out of My Head?

1307
01:34:12,830 --> 01:34:13,870
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just curious what it looks like.

1308
01:34:17,072 --> 01:34:17,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that's lame.

1309
01:34:19,465 --> 01:34:20,605
[SPEAKER_14]: That's super lame.

1310
01:34:21,926 --> 01:34:23,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't get the SARS out of my head.

1311
01:34:23,706 --> 01:34:23,986
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

1312
01:34:24,526 --> 01:34:24,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yes.

1313
01:34:25,247 --> 01:34:26,327
[SPEAKER_14]: Our topic at hand.

1314
01:34:26,447 --> 01:34:26,807
[SPEAKER_11]: SARS.

1315
01:34:26,927 --> 01:34:29,928
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to talk about G4's list of the 100 greatest games of all time.

1316
01:34:30,368 --> 01:34:32,509
[SPEAKER_14]: That they got together with Entertainment Weekly.

1317
01:34:32,829 --> 01:34:33,869
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're going to make fun of it.

1318
01:34:35,729 --> 01:34:36,570
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you're going to go blow your nose.

1319
01:34:37,470 --> 01:34:46,272
[SPEAKER_12]: First off, if you happen to be watching G4 any time of the day, no matter what day, you're going to catch this goddamn show because they play it all the time.

1320
01:34:47,192 --> 01:34:47,753
[SPEAKER_12]: All the time.

1321
01:34:48,513 --> 01:34:48,953
[SPEAKER_12]: And they suck.

1322
01:34:51,246 --> 01:34:57,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so now we're going to talk about the 100 greatest video games of all time, according to a bunch of schmoes.

1323
01:35:00,429 --> 01:35:02,130
[SPEAKER_12]: DDR is on the list, I might add.

1324
01:35:03,210 --> 01:35:08,072
[SPEAKER_14]: DDR is on the list, so if you don't know where it clocks in, listen to us, we'll tell you where it clocks in.

1325
01:35:08,092 --> 01:35:09,552
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like a throne.

1326
01:35:09,952 --> 01:35:10,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.

1327
01:35:10,973 --> 01:35:12,413
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're sitting on it, don't you feel special?

1328
01:35:12,773 --> 01:35:16,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so let's get everybody's thoughts and opinions on the top 100 games here.

1329
01:35:16,114 --> 01:35:17,535
[SPEAKER_14]: 100 on their list.

1330
01:35:17,975 --> 01:35:18,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Missile Command.

1331
01:35:19,115 --> 01:35:19,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

1332
01:35:19,876 --> 01:35:20,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Missile Command was cool.

1333
01:35:21,448 --> 01:35:28,129
[SPEAKER_05]: I have that on the 2600, 5200, a bunch of other things, Intellivision Yeah, there's no Scoobman 2000, I think Whatever that was Nice, please Sam, moving on, alright?

1334
01:35:50,009 --> 01:35:52,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 98, Frogger.

1335
01:35:54,552 --> 01:35:55,513
[SPEAKER_14]: A Konami game, yes?

1336
01:35:55,893 --> 01:35:56,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1337
01:35:56,733 --> 01:35:58,655
[SPEAKER_14]: It always makes me think of that episode of Seinfeld.

1338
01:35:58,775 --> 01:36:02,177
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not even that big a fan of Seinfeld, but I will never forget that episode of Seinfeld with the Frogger.

1339
01:36:02,197 --> 01:36:02,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I've watched it.

1340
01:36:03,998 --> 01:36:06,720
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the greatest... I've only seen one episode of Seinfeld, and it was the last one.

1341
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:07,760
[SPEAKER_05]: You know why I went?

1342
01:36:08,181 --> 01:36:12,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it was at the Red Lion Convention Center by the mall, and they gave out free food.

1343
01:36:15,505 --> 01:36:17,126
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so ghetto fabulous.

1344
01:36:19,488 --> 01:36:22,190
[SPEAKER_14]: The only other episode, I remember three episodes of Seinfeld.

1345
01:36:22,210 --> 01:36:24,012
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember the Gradius one.

1346
01:36:24,632 --> 01:36:25,973
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, not Gradius.

1347
01:36:26,874 --> 01:36:27,875
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember the Frogger one.

1348
01:36:28,815 --> 01:36:33,599
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember the masturbation one, where they make the contest about who can go the longest without masturbating.

1349
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:39,083
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I remember the one where they go to a Chinese restaurant and they dare Elaine to steal an egg roll.

1350
01:36:40,204 --> 01:36:41,485
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, yeah.

1351
01:36:41,745 --> 01:36:43,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember the one where they all died.

1352
01:36:44,187 --> 01:36:45,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh wait, I dreamed that.

1353
01:36:46,569 --> 01:36:47,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Number ninety-seven.

1354
01:36:48,775 --> 01:36:49,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Secret of Mana.

1355
01:36:51,337 --> 01:36:52,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Why so low on the list?

1356
01:36:52,238 --> 01:36:53,118
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to be higher.

1357
01:36:53,339 --> 01:36:53,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1358
01:36:54,479 --> 01:36:55,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck that.

1359
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:57,001
[SPEAKER_14]: At least it wasn't Secret of Evermore.

1360
01:36:57,242 --> 01:36:57,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Question!

1361
01:36:57,962 --> 01:36:59,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep going.

1362
01:37:01,045 --> 01:37:04,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, what do you think about Second Densetsu 3?

1363
01:37:04,867 --> 01:37:06,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Why didn't they ever release that here?

1364
01:37:06,349 --> 01:37:06,809
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to.

1365
01:37:07,369 --> 01:37:08,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they?

1366
01:37:08,490 --> 01:37:09,331
[SPEAKER_14]: When?

1367
01:37:09,391 --> 01:37:12,553
[SPEAKER_05]: After they released the first Second Densetsu, which was released as Final Fantasy Adventure.

1368
01:37:12,693 --> 01:37:14,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what that Sword of Mana is that they're doing?

1369
01:37:16,136 --> 01:37:17,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Sword of Mana is just Second Densetsu 3?

1370
01:37:18,098 --> 01:37:18,438
[SPEAKER_05]: First one.

1371
01:37:19,386 --> 01:37:20,086
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1372
01:37:40,173 --> 01:37:48,215
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 96 on their list, M-U-L-E, which is a game a lot of people probably don't remember, but if you did ever play it, this game was a shit.

1373
01:37:48,235 --> 01:37:54,597
[SPEAKER_14]: It was one of the first multiplayer games that was just downright innovative for its time.

1374
01:37:54,797 --> 01:37:56,277
[SPEAKER_14]: It's well-deserved mention on the list.

1375
01:37:56,297 --> 01:37:57,117
[SPEAKER_04]: You said downright.

1376
01:37:59,038 --> 01:38:02,038
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 95, Golden Axe.

1377
01:38:02,939 --> 01:38:03,659
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's funny?

1378
01:38:04,239 --> 01:38:08,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Golden Axe the Duel was the first game I played on the Saturn, and it was an important one.

1379
01:38:08,871 --> 01:38:18,938
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I remember about Golden Axe was the ending where it showed the people in the arcade and the heroes jumped out of the screen and trampled all the people in the arcade.

1380
01:38:19,098 --> 01:38:19,739
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.

1381
01:38:19,799 --> 01:38:21,720
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the best part about Golden Axe was the ending.

1382
01:38:22,821 --> 01:38:25,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 94 is a game I've never fucking heard of.

1383
01:38:25,162 --> 01:38:27,164
[SPEAKER_14]: It's IL2 Stromovic.

1384
01:38:27,664 --> 01:38:28,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, whatever.

1385
01:38:28,365 --> 01:38:28,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

1386
01:38:28,705 --> 01:38:29,305
[SPEAKER_14]: 93, Joust.

1387
01:38:32,035 --> 01:38:35,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Joust is like one of the games I play on Alter Pave all the time.

1388
01:38:35,416 --> 01:38:35,916
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1389
01:38:35,936 --> 01:38:39,297
[SPEAKER_05]: They had the Nintendo version, which was Balloon Fight.

1390
01:38:41,418 --> 01:38:42,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember Balloon Fight?

1391
01:38:43,258 --> 01:38:43,398
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1392
01:38:43,598 --> 01:38:45,239
[SPEAKER_05]: We who play Animal Crossing should have Balloon Fight.

1393
01:38:45,259 --> 01:38:45,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I know Balloon Fight.

1394
01:38:46,519 --> 01:38:48,279
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just being difficult.

1395
01:38:48,299 --> 01:38:49,300
[SPEAKER_14]: 92, Super Star Wars.

1396
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:52,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh, yeah.

1397
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:52,820
[SPEAKER_14]: You ever play it?

1398
01:38:53,321 --> 01:38:53,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1399
01:38:53,441 --> 01:38:54,201
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.

1400
01:38:54,221 --> 01:38:54,661
[SPEAKER_14]: It's okay.

1401
01:38:55,768 --> 01:38:57,649
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it should be on the top 100 of videos of all time.

1402
01:38:57,669 --> 01:38:59,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Star Wars is great because of the debug mode.

1403
01:39:00,129 --> 01:39:01,230
[SPEAKER_05]: You could, like, skip levels.

1404
01:39:01,930 --> 01:39:03,070
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't know there was a debug mode.

1405
01:39:03,190 --> 01:39:06,271
[SPEAKER_05]: There is for all three of the Star Wars games on the Super Nintendo.

1406
01:39:06,391 --> 01:39:07,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'll be damned.

1407
01:39:07,751 --> 01:39:09,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to bring over my SNES one day.

1408
01:39:09,752 --> 01:39:10,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

1409
01:39:10,552 --> 01:39:11,452
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can play all the games.

1410
01:39:11,472 --> 01:39:12,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we play ActRaiser?

1411
01:39:13,013 --> 01:39:13,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I have it.

1412
01:39:14,113 --> 01:39:16,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Because ActRaiser is, like, my favorite Super Nintendo game ever.

1413
01:39:16,394 --> 01:39:17,274
[SPEAKER_14]: I wonder what's on this list.

1414
01:39:17,314 --> 01:39:17,774
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even know.

1415
01:39:17,994 --> 01:39:18,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep going.

1416
01:39:18,915 --> 01:39:19,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Keep going!

1417
01:39:20,015 --> 01:39:20,435
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye, Hunter.

1418
01:39:21,563 --> 01:39:25,806
[SPEAKER_14]: You know they're going to make a movie out of Spy Hunter?

1419
01:39:26,126 --> 01:39:26,886
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be kind of cool.

1420
01:39:27,767 --> 01:39:28,307
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Loki.

1421
01:39:29,268 --> 01:39:30,108
[SPEAKER_14]: And guess who's in it?

1422
01:39:30,669 --> 01:39:30,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Who?

1423
01:39:31,009 --> 01:39:31,649
[SPEAKER_14]: The Rock!

1424
01:39:32,610 --> 01:39:33,510
[SPEAKER_05]: No shit.

1425
01:39:33,590 --> 01:39:35,431
[SPEAKER_14]: God, it's going to be awful.

1426
01:39:36,192 --> 01:39:39,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, did you ever play... I wish we could, like, spray oil on his limousine.

1427
01:39:40,054 --> 01:39:42,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you ever play Spy Hunter, though, that was on the PS2?

1428
01:39:43,756 --> 01:39:44,417
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty rad.

1429
01:39:45,037 --> 01:39:45,497
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I never did.

1430
01:39:45,817 --> 01:39:46,398
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty cool.

1431
01:39:47,558 --> 01:39:47,679
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, 90...

1432
01:39:49,212 --> 01:39:50,953
[SPEAKER_14]: Crash Bandicoot 3 warped.

1433
01:39:51,233 --> 01:39:51,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Gag!

1434
01:39:52,354 --> 01:39:53,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate Crash Bandicoot.

1435
01:39:53,235 --> 01:39:53,875
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks retarded.

1436
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:57,458
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if that's the Crash Bandicoot game I would have put it there.

1437
01:39:57,598 --> 01:40:00,099
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel really ripped because I bought... What was that game?

1438
01:40:00,159 --> 01:40:01,080
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Crash Bandicoot.

1439
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:03,201
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like Crash Bandicoot's answer to Mario Party.

1440
01:40:03,522 --> 01:40:04,222
[SPEAKER_14]: What was it called?

1441
01:40:04,642 --> 01:40:05,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Crash Party?

1442
01:40:05,383 --> 01:40:05,983
[SPEAKER_14]: Crash Party.

1443
01:40:06,263 --> 01:40:07,024
[SPEAKER_14]: It's awful.

1444
01:40:07,644 --> 01:40:09,025
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish I would have just bought Mario Party.

1445
01:40:09,065 --> 01:40:09,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted Sonic Party.

1446
01:40:10,006 --> 01:40:10,206
[SPEAKER_14]: Huh?

1447
01:40:10,546 --> 01:40:11,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted the Sonic Party game.

1448
01:40:11,767 --> 01:40:12,247
[SPEAKER_14]: I have it.

1449
01:40:13,288 --> 01:40:13,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Somewhere.

1450
01:40:13,808 --> 01:40:14,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it okay?

1451
01:40:14,629 --> 01:40:15,189
[SPEAKER_14]: It's okay.

1452
01:40:15,269 --> 01:40:17,451
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of... I couldn't figure it out, but I'm lazy.

1453
01:40:17,471 --> 01:40:17,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1454
01:40:18,277 --> 01:40:19,598
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no attention span whatsoever.

1455
01:40:20,158 --> 01:40:22,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, 89, Castle Wolfenstein.

1456
01:40:22,820 --> 01:40:23,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1457
01:40:24,021 --> 01:40:26,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, is that referring to the original on the Apple IIe?

1458
01:40:26,643 --> 01:40:27,243
[SPEAKER_14]: I think not.

1459
01:40:27,603 --> 01:40:28,644
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it referring to the original?

1460
01:40:30,666 --> 01:40:31,766
[SPEAKER_12]: I watched this stupid thing.

1461
01:40:31,966 --> 01:40:34,868
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the original one they're talking about, not Wolfenstein 3D.

1462
01:40:36,249 --> 01:40:37,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, fine.

1463
01:40:37,270 --> 01:40:40,592
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have to make, uh, give a nod to the original.

1464
01:40:41,133 --> 01:40:45,616
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't put the original Wolfenstein above, like, M-U-L-E, but whatever.

1465
01:40:45,976 --> 01:40:49,037
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was all about playing Doom and going to the Wolfenstein level by warping there.

1466
01:40:49,558 --> 01:40:49,878
[SPEAKER_14]: Sheesh.

1467
01:40:51,438 --> 01:40:53,639
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, number 88, FIFA Soccer 2003.

1468
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:55,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

1469
01:40:55,220 --> 01:40:58,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever, we don't talk about sports on this show.

1470
01:40:58,462 --> 01:40:59,362
[SPEAKER_14]: 87 was Battlezone.

1471
01:41:00,783 --> 01:41:01,763
[SPEAKER_14]: Battlezone was cool.

1472
01:41:01,783 --> 01:41:02,443
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember the tank?

1473
01:41:03,644 --> 01:41:04,484
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't remember Battlezone?

1474
01:41:04,504 --> 01:41:05,225
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't play Battlezone.

1475
01:41:05,285 --> 01:41:07,366
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a vector game and you were in the tank?

1476
01:41:07,466 --> 01:41:08,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it on the Vectrex?

1477
01:41:09,126 --> 01:41:10,007
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it might have been.

1478
01:41:10,067 --> 01:41:10,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I didn't play the Vectrex.

1479
01:41:11,007 --> 01:41:11,527
[SPEAKER_14]: It was Atari.

1480
01:41:11,828 --> 01:41:12,688
[SPEAKER_14]: It was Atari's game.

1481
01:41:12,968 --> 01:41:14,169
[SPEAKER_05]: You know we've been looking for a Vectrex.

1482
01:41:14,529 --> 01:41:14,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

1483
01:41:14,809 --> 01:41:14,889
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1484
01:41:15,583 --> 01:41:16,184
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't doubt it.

1485
01:41:17,124 --> 01:41:16,184
86.

1486
01:41:17,225 --> 01:41:19,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it smells like fabric softener.

1487
01:41:19,406 --> 01:41:19,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no wonder.

1488
01:41:20,307 --> 01:41:22,108
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank God this game made the list.

1489
01:41:22,748 --> 01:41:24,510
[SPEAKER_14]: 86 was Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo.

1490
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:25,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen.

1491
01:41:25,991 --> 01:41:28,072
[SPEAKER_05]: They're supposed to have... No, that was Gem Fighter.

1492
01:41:28,733 --> 01:41:29,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Gem, but Pocket Fighter.

1493
01:41:29,774 --> 01:41:31,395
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a second one out now.

1494
01:41:31,535 --> 01:41:33,396
[SPEAKER_14]: When are they going to release a new version of Puzzle Fighter?

1495
01:41:33,676 --> 01:41:35,237
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the game they need to take online.

1496
01:41:35,297 --> 01:41:35,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Forget DDR.

1497
01:41:35,838 --> 01:41:36,799
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's awesome?

1498
01:41:36,859 --> 01:41:40,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I have Puzzle Fighter, the one that's on the Dreamcast.

1499
01:41:40,801 --> 01:41:42,963
[SPEAKER_05]: That was awesome because there's like a columns mode in it.

1500
01:41:44,230 --> 01:41:46,212
[SPEAKER_05]: As well as another type of mode in there.

1501
01:41:47,173 --> 01:41:48,293
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like three different modes.

1502
01:41:48,414 --> 01:41:49,494
[SPEAKER_05]: XYZ mode is awesome.

1503
01:41:49,514 --> 01:41:53,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus it had the Sakura vocal song in it.

1504
01:41:53,598 --> 01:41:54,278
[SPEAKER_14]: 85, Prince of Persia.

1505
01:41:55,399 --> 01:41:56,400
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I hate that game.

1506
01:41:56,620 --> 01:42:02,045
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, Prince of Persia was so like... It's an ad for all over your old gaming magazines to this day.

1507
01:42:02,065 --> 01:42:02,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

1508
01:42:02,825 --> 01:42:05,107
[SPEAKER_14]: And how many freaking systems was that game on?

1509
01:42:05,447 --> 01:42:05,888

1519
01:42:23,487 --> 01:42:24,707
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you love about Daytona, Loki?

1520
01:42:25,608 --> 01:42:34,312
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fun, and a lot of the arcades, especially the ones like in Reno and stuff, they've got like 16 machines hooked together, so it's like one hell of a race.

1521
01:42:35,332 --> 01:42:39,314
[SPEAKER_12]: Normally they're like huge lap settings, so you're like racing about 12 people and stuff.

1522
01:42:39,514 --> 01:42:41,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I have nightmares, though, about that game for one reason.

1523
01:42:42,196 --> 01:42:44,777
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked in an arcade where they never turned off the attract.

1524
01:42:45,492 --> 01:42:45,992

1527
01:42:52,134 --> 01:42:54,195
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there was actually a really funny penny arcade to that.

1528
01:42:55,055 --> 01:42:56,656
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember where exactly it was.

1529
01:42:56,716 --> 01:42:58,076
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the older ones from a couple years ago.

1530
01:42:58,096 --> 01:43:09,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember Gabe, but the other guy was sitting down at the computer and Gabe walks up and goes, do-do-do-do-do-do-daytona.

1531
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:10,621
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other guy reaches up and grabs out his heart.

1532
01:43:10,821 --> 01:43:11,881
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, ah!

1533

1664
01:48:03,175 --> 01:48:04,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1665
01:48:05,895 --> 01:48:11,237
[SPEAKER_14]: Why so high?

1666
01:48:11,257 --> 01:48:13,818
[SPEAKER_14]: 39, beating out Dance Dance Revolution, Mortal Kombat 2.

1667
01:48:16,519 --> 01:48:17,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I like Mortal Kombat.

1668
01:48:17,499 --> 01:48:18,059
[SPEAKER_14]: Pertality.

1669
01:48:18,579 --> 01:48:26,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Mortal Kombat 2 because I like playing on the beta kits where you can do the infinite juggles and float and start off your game against Shao Kahn.

1670
01:48:29,537 --> 01:48:30,257
[SPEAKER_14]: Where the hell was I?

1671
01:48:30,537 --> 01:48:31,438
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in high school.

1672
01:48:32,419 --> 01:48:33,739
[SPEAKER_14]: 38, Sonic the Hedgehog.

1673
01:48:36,241 --> 01:48:36,741
[SPEAKER_14]: 37, SimCity.

1674
01:48:37,922 --> 01:48:39,103
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1675
01:48:39,123 --> 01:48:40,424
[SPEAKER_14]: 36, Tom Clancy, Splinter Cell.

1676
01:48:40,464 --> 01:48:42,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever, I hate Tom Clancy games.

1677
01:48:42,665 --> 01:48:43,106
[SPEAKER_14]: 35, Battlefield 1942.

1678
01:48:43,146 --> 01:48:45,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

1679
01:48:45,367 --> 01:48:48,069
[SPEAKER_14]: 34, ooh, this is a good pick, Ultima 4, Quest of the Avatar.

1680
01:48:48,569 --> 01:48:49,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1681
01:48:50,010 --> 01:48:50,951
[SPEAKER_14]: 33, Duke Nukem 3D.

1682
01:48:51,891 --> 01:48:54,233
[SPEAKER_14]: Your face, your ass, what's the difference?

1683
01:48:54,253 --> 01:48:54,953
[SPEAKER_14]: 32, Tekken 2.

1684
01:48:55,534 --> 01:48:57,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Tekken 2 had June in it.

1685
01:48:58,811 --> 01:49:25,358
[SPEAKER_14]: 31, Diablo 2 30, Mario Kart 64 29, Medal of Honor, Allied Assault 28, Galaga 27, Monkey Island 2, Lee Chuck's Revenge 26, Command and Conquer, Red Alert 25, Star Wars X, Wing Alliance 24, Castlevania, Symphony of the Night Oh my god, yes

1686
01:49:27,364 --> 01:49:42,309
[SPEAKER_14]: 23, Metal Gear Solid 22, Resident Evil 21, EverQuest Now that the others are back, we can slow this down a little bit to really rant about the top 20.

1687
01:49:43,150 --> 01:49:47,111
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I know Brad has a few things he wants to say about some of the ones he heard just coming in the door.

1688
01:49:50,352 --> 01:49:50,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Brad?

1689
01:49:52,133 --> 01:49:53,113
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this big thing?

1690
01:49:53,692 --> 01:49:57,174
[SPEAKER_14]: This, by the way, is G4 Entertainment Weekly's list of top 100 games of all time.

1691
01:49:57,194 --> 01:50:09,842
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I've read so many of these lists over the years, and I already know when they do these top 100 things, that they get really lazy, and they kind of just... Because you can't really concentrate on every little thing, so they just start splashing games here and there because they don't know where to put them.

1692
01:50:10,443 --> 01:50:21,550
[SPEAKER_15]: My opinion about some of these games being at like 24, 25, whatever it was, Castlevania Symphony of the Night, you know, in my opinion, should be up there in the top 5 at least, but I haven't read what their other top 19 or 18 or 20 is, so I don't know.

1693
01:50:23,484 --> 01:50:24,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Why they're thinking these are their games.

1694
01:50:24,965 --> 01:50:27,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Do they have explanations for why these games should be in the top 20?

1695
01:50:27,587 --> 01:50:29,388
[SPEAKER_14]: If you watch the show, but we're not endorsing that.

1696
01:50:30,669 --> 01:50:30,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Good.

1697
01:50:31,389 --> 01:50:31,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1698
01:50:32,690 --> 01:50:36,693
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, as I name off these top 20... Your solid should also be up in the top 5, but whatever.

1699
01:50:36,813 --> 01:50:41,076
[SPEAKER_14]: As I name off these top 20, you can tell us if they were deserving, Brad.

1700
01:50:41,116 --> 01:50:44,158
[SPEAKER_14]: You can be the critic on if they're deserving of being in the top 20.

1701
01:50:44,398 --> 01:50:44,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Brad?

1702
01:50:45,959 --> 01:50:46,840
[SPEAKER_14]: Where'd the ice queen go?

1703
01:50:47,620 --> 01:50:48,321
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

1704
01:50:48,801 --> 01:50:48,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1705
01:50:52,031 --> 01:50:52,751
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, here we go.

1706
01:50:53,011 --> 01:50:54,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't need a quarter.

1707
01:50:56,453 --> 01:50:57,273
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go, kids.

1708
01:50:58,093 --> 01:51:00,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 20, Super Metroid.

1709
01:51:01,415 --> 01:51:02,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, God, yes.

1710
01:51:03,095 --> 01:51:04,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 20, Super Metroid.

1711
01:51:05,476 --> 01:51:12,779
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely deserving of being in the top 20, but I don't know if it should be at the lowest of the top 20.

1712
01:51:12,819 --> 01:51:15,740
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what the other games are, so... Excellent game, though.

1713
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:16,500
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely should be in the top 20.

1714
01:51:16,540 --> 01:51:16,600
[SPEAKER_15]: 19, Ms.

1715
01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:16,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Pac-Man.

1716
01:51:16,780 --> 01:51:17,881
[SPEAKER_14]: What...

1717
01:51:22,762 --> 01:51:26,163
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're talking of all time, come on, Ms.

1718
01:51:26,183 --> 01:51:27,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Pac-Man, of all time.

1719
01:51:28,685 --> 01:51:28,865
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1720
01:51:29,305 --> 01:51:29,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1721
01:51:29,585 --> 01:51:30,086
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

1722
01:51:30,166 --> 01:51:30,346
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1723
01:51:30,906 --> 01:51:31,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Deserving of top 20.

1724
01:51:31,646 --> 01:51:31,866
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

1725
01:51:31,906 --> 01:51:37,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Pac-Man has so little gameplay comparing to something like Super Metroid.

1726
01:51:37,870 --> 01:51:40,971
[SPEAKER_14]: It should be in the top 100, but maybe like at 99.

1727
01:51:42,172 --> 01:51:42,792
[SPEAKER_14]: That's sad.

1728
01:51:43,212 --> 01:51:44,973
[SPEAKER_14]: If you were 10 years older, you would not say that.

1729
01:51:45,534 --> 01:51:46,014
[SPEAKER_14]: What the fuck?

1730
01:51:46,374 --> 01:51:47,475
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember when it came out.

1731
01:51:47,515 --> 01:51:47,775
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

1732
01:51:48,502 --> 01:51:52,044
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm saying, but if that was the game that everybody was playing in the arcades, like, now it's... It doesn't matter!

1733
01:51:52,665 --> 01:51:57,007
[SPEAKER_14]: The game itself, as far as gameplay is concerned, that's the reason why we play video games, is because they're fun.

1734
01:51:57,387 --> 01:51:57,748
[SPEAKER_14]: And Ms.

1735
01:51:57,768 --> 01:52:02,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Pac-Man is not nearly as fun as something that has as much gameplay as Symphony of the Night, or Super Metroid.

1736
01:52:02,971 --> 01:52:07,173
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care if it's, oh, it brings you back to your past, or whatever, it's still not as fun.

1737
01:52:07,193 --> 01:52:09,535
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it has anything to do with that.

1738
01:52:09,815 --> 01:52:12,536
[SPEAKER_15]: If that's what it does to me, then you're playing video games for the wrong reason, in my opinion.

1739
01:52:12,556 --> 01:52:13,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but do you own a magazine?

1740
01:52:13,637 --> 01:52:15,078
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think so, so, huh!

1741
01:52:16,359 --> 01:52:16,879
[SPEAKER_14]: And I will.

1742
01:52:17,659 --> 01:52:18,980
[SPEAKER_14]: And it'll be very Nazi-ish.

1743
01:52:20,221 --> 01:52:20,521
[SPEAKER_14]: No Ms.

1744
01:52:20,541 --> 01:52:21,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Pac-Man for you.

1745
01:52:22,582 --> 01:52:23,743
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd say it'd be Pac-Man.

1746
01:52:24,604 --> 01:52:26,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Number... 18.

1747
01:52:27,305 --> 01:52:28,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Soul Calibur.

1748
01:52:29,627 --> 01:52:29,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1749
01:52:30,087 --> 01:52:30,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Soul Calibur, yes.

1750
01:52:31,708 --> 01:52:34,270
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can't forget, though, Soul Edge.

1751
01:52:35,951 --> 01:52:37,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is not on the list, I can tell you.

1752
01:52:37,552 --> 01:52:44,397
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the reason why... I think the reason why they would put that up there as far as... Because Soul Calibur... They're probably talking about the console version.

1753
01:52:45,017 --> 01:52:45,978
[SPEAKER_15]: It was kind of a...

1754
01:52:46,909 --> 01:52:53,051
[SPEAKER_15]: It kind of pushed the fighting game on the console to, like, it pushed the envelope on it.

1755
01:52:53,091 --> 01:52:54,711
[SPEAKER_14]: It gave you a lot more extra features.

1756
01:52:54,771 --> 01:52:56,992
[SPEAKER_14]: It was kind of one of the first things, the big ones, to do that.

1757
01:52:57,432 --> 01:53:01,854
[SPEAKER_14]: And Soul Edge was a great game on the console, but Soul Calibur really pushed it to the limit.

1758
01:53:02,714 --> 01:53:08,276
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing to consider also, when they brought out Soul Calibur on the Dreamcast, the graphics were better than the arcade version.

1759
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:11,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is like, had never been done before.

1760
01:53:13,037 --> 01:53:15,998
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly, and that's probably one of the reasons why it's up there.

1761
01:53:17,878 --> 01:53:27,665
[SPEAKER_14]: This is going to get an interesting reaction.

1762
01:53:27,685 --> 01:53:28,345
[SPEAKER_14]: 17, Tomb Raider.

1763
01:53:30,767 --> 01:53:38,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I hate Tomb Raider, but it needs to be somewhere up on the list because it did start a new kind of genre.

1764
01:53:39,153 --> 01:53:43,076
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there were other games kind of like it, but it was the one that kind of got accepted for...

1765
01:53:44,301 --> 01:53:45,482
[SPEAKER_15]: starting this new genre again.

1766
01:53:45,582 --> 01:53:47,043
[SPEAKER_12]: The big-breasted action hero!

1767
01:53:47,303 --> 01:53:47,883
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly!

1768
01:53:48,463 --> 01:53:49,504
[SPEAKER_12]: Matt knows what I'm talking about.

1769
01:53:51,125 --> 01:53:53,626
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I think... I want Stripperella the game.

1770
01:53:54,487 --> 01:53:55,327
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold on, hold on.

1771
01:53:55,467 --> 01:53:59,730
[SPEAKER_14]: As silly as Matt's kind of being joking, it's kind of true.

1772
01:54:00,550 --> 01:54:10,716
[SPEAKER_14]: A big-breasted, like a female who kicked ass in a video game and became like an icon, basically like the logo for the PlayStation for a while was Laura Croft.

1773
01:54:10,976 --> 01:54:12,497
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I hate the game, but...

1774
01:54:13,818 --> 01:54:21,060
[SPEAKER_15]: It did do something huge to... And that probably sounds hypocritical because I said it like Ms.

1775
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:21,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Pac-Man.

1776
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:22,720
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's not fun.

1777
01:54:24,360 --> 01:54:28,101
[SPEAKER_14]: That was actually what I was going to say because... And I preempted it.

1778
01:54:28,501 --> 01:54:28,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Because Ms.

1779
01:54:29,001 --> 01:54:31,162
[SPEAKER_14]: Pac-Man... Well, actually, not Ms.

1780
01:54:31,182 --> 01:54:32,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Pac-Man so much as Pac-Man.

1781
01:54:32,102 --> 01:54:35,743
[SPEAKER_05]: In the sense of Tomb Raider 2, you could blow her up and throw her off the balcony and make her break her neck.

1782
01:54:35,763 --> 01:54:36,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

1783
01:54:37,185 --> 01:54:37,886
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's another thing.

1784
01:54:38,126 --> 01:54:44,630
[SPEAKER_15]: In this Pac-Man, you can't swan dive off a 30-story cliff and kill yourself, but you can do that in Tomb Raider, and that's what makes Tomb Raider fun.

1785
01:54:47,352 --> 01:54:48,493
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see her with her broken neck.

1786
01:54:48,713 --> 01:54:49,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1787
01:54:50,534 --> 01:54:51,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving on.

1788
01:54:51,935 --> 01:54:52,495
[SPEAKER_14]: 16, Halo.

1789
01:54:52,515 --> 01:54:55,577
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't played it, so I guess I'm not a true gamer.

1790
01:54:55,597 --> 01:55:02,162
[SPEAKER_05]: 15, and this... Halo is freaking gorgeous, and actually, I can probably say that, yeah, it should be up there.

1791
01:55:03,082 --> 01:55:05,244
[SPEAKER_15]: You've played a few FPSs, I believe.

1792
01:55:06,601 --> 01:55:07,681
[SPEAKER_15]: First Person Shooters, right?

1793
01:55:10,222 --> 01:55:11,023
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold on.

1794
01:55:12,943 --> 01:55:13,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, I need to get something.

1795
01:55:14,624 --> 01:55:17,505
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you've played quite a few First Person Shooters before, right?

1796
01:55:18,185 --> 01:55:20,266
[SPEAKER_14]: So you know the difference.

1797
01:55:20,286 --> 01:55:24,288
[SPEAKER_14]: I've never played Halo, so what's so great about Halo that makes it different than other First Person Shooters?

1798
01:55:25,148 --> 01:55:31,470
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just really interactive, very responsive, and you've got so many different levels you can play on, and you can play it in different ways.

1799
01:55:31,911 --> 01:55:35,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus, when you play multiplayer, you can play cooperatively with another person.

1800
01:55:35,993 --> 01:55:38,835
[SPEAKER_05]: instead of having, excuse me, Deathmatch.

1801
01:55:38,875 --> 01:55:40,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm, like, burping up.

1802
01:55:41,738 --> 01:55:42,118
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1803
01:55:42,138 --> 01:55:46,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, but on top of that, it's really pretty.

1804
01:55:46,201 --> 01:55:46,942
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, really pretty.

1805
01:55:47,002 --> 01:55:50,464
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really shows what the Xbox can do, honestly.

1806
01:55:50,965 --> 01:55:56,629
[SPEAKER_05]: And for me, even though Xbox isn't my favorite system, I'd have to say that, yeah, that has to be up there.

1807
01:55:56,649 --> 01:55:58,871
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, if Steel Battalion is not on the list, I'm going to scream.

1808
01:55:59,532 --> 01:56:00,732
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not.

1809
01:56:02,414 --> 01:56:03,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, moving on to number 15.

1810
01:56:04,195 --> 01:56:05,096
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is a game...

1811
01:56:05,805 --> 01:56:09,326
[SPEAKER_14]: I think should be in the top three, but it's not, but whatever.

1812
01:56:09,906 --> 01:56:10,727
[SPEAKER_14]: 15, Civilization 2.

1813
01:56:12,027 --> 01:56:13,848
[SPEAKER_05]: What, um, yeah.

1814
01:56:13,968 --> 01:56:16,889
[SPEAKER_14]: The greatest strategy game on the computer of all time.

1815
01:56:17,509 --> 01:56:17,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Period.

1816
01:56:19,750 --> 01:56:21,931
[SPEAKER_15]: No, Matt's saying Get a Rope.

1817
01:56:22,291 --> 01:56:29,994
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, Civilization 2 may not be my type of game, but I've seen, I like Civilization 1.

1818
01:56:31,054 --> 01:56:34,095
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess I wasn't as much into strategy games as I am, like adventure stuff.

1819
01:56:34,571 --> 01:56:37,873
[SPEAKER_14]: But I could see how it's so good, because I did like Civilization 1 for a while.

1820
01:56:38,353 --> 01:56:39,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Then it started to grate on me or whatever.

1821
01:56:39,794 --> 01:56:45,738
[SPEAKER_14]: But, I don't know, Sid Meier, I mean, he's just, I guess he's a genius when it comes to making strategy games, simulation games and stuff, so.

1822
01:56:46,598 --> 01:56:52,082
[SPEAKER_14]: I think also, Civilization can kind of be seen, this is the way I look at it, it's strategy games for dummies.

1823
01:56:52,662 --> 01:56:54,503
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a very accessible kind of game.

1824
01:56:54,803 --> 01:56:57,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, you don't really have to be into strategy games to play them.

1825
01:56:57,205 --> 01:56:58,125
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's what I'm saying.

1826
01:56:58,265 --> 01:57:02,508
[SPEAKER_15]: Sid Meier kind of makes his games kind of user-friendly, even though they have a lot of strategy involved.

1827
01:57:03,427 --> 01:57:06,268
[SPEAKER_15]: You can get into it even if you're kind of... I mean, like the Sims.

1828
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:11,650
[SPEAKER_15]: It can get pretty complicated, but... It's pretty actually... It shows you how to play pretty easily.

1829
01:57:12,030 --> 01:57:12,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, moving on.

1830
01:57:13,650 --> 01:57:14,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Fourteen.

1831
01:57:15,111 --> 01:57:16,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.

1832
01:57:17,411 --> 01:57:18,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, I'd have to say so.

1833
01:57:19,412 --> 01:57:21,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Changed the face of skateboard games forever.

1834
01:57:22,153 --> 01:57:25,534
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, skateboard games... What other... Skate or die.

1835
01:57:25,954 --> 01:57:28,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Skate or die should be above... Hold on, Tony Hawk's.

1836
01:57:29,095 --> 01:57:29,375
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on.

1837
01:57:30,175 --> 01:57:31,256
[SPEAKER_14]: In my opinion, or 720. 720.

1838
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:45,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Menace Beach, 720, 720, hey that's cool, um, no, TNC Surf Designs, um, no, but seriously, to me there basically are only two skateboard games, Tony Hawk Bros.

1839
01:57:45,648 --> 01:57:50,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Skater and Skater Die, so, that goes to show you how good Tony Hawk is.

1840
01:57:51,231 --> 01:57:54,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on, 720, what other game do you get chased by bees?

1841
01:57:56,034 --> 01:57:57,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, didn't that happen in Paperboy?

1842
01:57:57,796 --> 01:57:58,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Shut up.

1843
01:58:00,825 --> 01:58:01,825
[SPEAKER_14]: No, Paperboy's not on the list.

1844
01:58:01,845 --> 01:58:03,566
[SPEAKER_05]: God, Paperboy's not on the list, or Crystal Castles?

1845
01:58:03,806 --> 01:58:03,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

1846
01:58:03,966 --> 01:58:04,786
[SPEAKER_14]: Marble Madness?

1847
01:58:04,846 --> 01:58:05,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

1848
01:58:06,206 --> 01:58:07,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Those retards.

1849
01:58:07,506 --> 01:58:08,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, here we go.

1850
01:58:09,327 --> 01:58:10,327
[SPEAKER_14]: 13, Gran Turismo.

1851
01:58:12,347 --> 01:58:15,748
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, changed totally the course of racing games.

1852
01:58:16,728 --> 01:58:28,251
[SPEAKER_14]: And all the, not just realistic driving engine, but like, such a design, you know, aspect, like fine-tuning your cars and everything, it being like the main reason to even play the game.

1853
01:58:28,271 --> 01:58:29,911
[SPEAKER_14]: They just changed the direction.

1854
01:58:31,195 --> 01:58:36,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, now, number 12, and when I say this game, I need to make a footnote here.

1855
01:58:36,557 --> 01:58:50,043
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically what they did, I noticed on the G4 Entertainment Weekly list, is they kind of took series, and then kind of looped them all together into one position on the list, and then kind of, this list that I'm looking at kind of highlights one game.

1856
01:58:50,523 --> 01:58:51,283
[SPEAKER_14]: So you see what I'm saying?

1857
01:58:51,323 --> 01:58:54,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Even though I'm saying one game in the series, it means the whole series, basically.

1858
01:58:54,804 --> 01:58:55,365
[SPEAKER_14]: You see what I'm saying?

1859
01:58:55,885 --> 01:58:56,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Make sense?

1860
01:58:56,385 --> 01:58:59,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, with that being said, number 12 is Final Fantasy 7.

1861
01:58:59,046 --> 01:58:59,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1862
01:59:01,953 --> 01:59:03,914
[SPEAKER_14]: But that was to mean the whole Final Fantasy series.

1863
01:59:03,934 --> 01:59:06,896
[SPEAKER_14]: If they meant the whole series, if they truly meant that, that's forgivable.

1864
01:59:07,256 --> 01:59:13,820
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think they said Final Fantasy VII probably because more people know about Final Fantasy VII than any other Final Fantasy, because it really changed.

1865
01:59:14,821 --> 01:59:20,025
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing about Final Fantasy VII is that it brought it into, I guess, the modern age of games.

1866
01:59:21,666 --> 01:59:26,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, and it was mostly... Although I have to say, though, that

1867
01:59:27,839 --> 01:59:34,501
[SPEAKER_05]: It was... Now that I've gone back to play it again, I'm still hoping that they... The rumor proves out true and that they do an updated version.

1868
01:59:35,001 --> 01:59:36,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it would really benefit from it.

1869
01:59:40,623 --> 01:59:42,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, we can't hear Ice Queen because he has no mic.

1870
01:59:43,124 --> 01:59:43,964
[SPEAKER_14]: Matt is saying what?

1871
01:59:44,205 --> 01:59:44,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, crap.

1872
01:59:44,645 --> 01:59:50,207
[SPEAKER_14]: The mic's stuck in the... Okay.

1873
01:59:50,247 --> 01:59:50,947
[SPEAKER_15]: What were you saying, Matt?

1874
01:59:52,607 --> 01:59:56,989
[SPEAKER_13]: What I was saying for anybody that cares was that Final Fantasy VII was...

1875
01:59:58,090 --> 02:00:03,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Really, really good just because of the fact that it revolutionized the eye candy for Final Fantasy.

1876
02:00:04,013 --> 02:00:04,934
[SPEAKER_13]: It was the first eye candy.

1877
02:00:04,954 --> 02:00:08,236
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't look very good now, but for its time it looked really, really good.

1878
02:00:09,136 --> 02:00:11,658
[SPEAKER_13]: And it had really good backgrounds, yeah.

1879
02:00:12,398 --> 02:00:26,646
[SPEAKER_14]: The thing, the people that are like, kind of like gaming purists would, or Final Fantasy 6 purists or whatever would say is that that's a bad thing that it revolutionized the eye candy thing because Squaresoft for a while started going only for the cinematics and the eye candy for a while.

1880
02:00:27,148 --> 02:00:29,930
[SPEAKER_14]: and they just forgot about gameplay when it comes to, like, Final Fantasy VIII.

1881
02:00:31,191 --> 02:00:32,011
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my opinion.

1882
02:00:32,031 --> 02:00:32,972
[SPEAKER_03]: VIII wasn't actually that bad.

1883
02:00:33,592 --> 02:00:33,913
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.

1884
02:00:34,713 --> 02:00:35,574
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie says X was good.

1885
02:00:35,594 --> 02:00:39,436
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they kind of went back to mixing the gameplay with the cinematics.

1886
02:00:40,297 --> 02:00:45,401
[SPEAKER_14]: But wait, what were we... There was something I was going to say.

1887
02:00:45,561 --> 02:00:48,423
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want me to... Can I elaborate on the Final Fantasy VII remake thing?

1888
02:00:48,823 --> 02:00:49,323
[SPEAKER_14]: Keep going, yeah.

1889
02:00:49,463 --> 02:00:49,744
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1890
02:00:50,524 --> 02:00:54,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie was saying she really hopes the rumor about Final Fantasy VII remake on PS2 is true.

1891
02:00:55,208 --> 02:01:07,654
[SPEAKER_14]: they did an interview with us well actually Squaresoft posted something to the users about we've started to make sequels to Final Fantasy with Final Fantasy X-2 coming out which other games would you like there to be sequels to?

1892
02:01:08,215 --> 02:01:24,823
[SPEAKER_14]: overwhelmingly people said Final Fantasy 7 Squaresoft rebuttaled by saying we don't have the time or effort to remake the engine for Final Fantasy 7 of course everybody said use X2's engine we use whatever now so if that's true that they don't have the time money or effort to make it

1893
02:01:25,247 --> 02:01:26,868
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not going to be able to remake Final Fantasy 7.

1894
02:01:27,748 --> 02:01:32,569
[SPEAKER_14]: But there was a rumor, and it was confirmed that eventually they were going to remake Final Fantasy 7.

1895
02:01:32,609 --> 02:01:33,170
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I don't know.

1896
02:01:33,310 --> 02:01:35,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Squirtle's got their head up their asses now, so who knows.

1897
02:01:36,631 --> 02:01:36,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1898
02:01:38,551 --> 02:01:41,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving on to the list, and I'll just say it.

1899
02:01:41,612 --> 02:01:43,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 11 is GoldenEye 007.

1900
02:01:44,853 --> 02:01:48,874
[SPEAKER_05]: That game was actually pretty good, but that game actually did make me throw up.

1901
02:01:49,575 --> 02:01:49,595
[SPEAKER_14]: I...

1902
02:01:52,054 --> 02:01:56,855
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care if it's the best Nintendo 64 game ever made, it's undeserving of being in the top 20, in my opinion.

1903
02:01:59,656 --> 02:02:12,078
[SPEAKER_14]: The way it got up there is because if it wasn't for that game, Halo wouldn't be around, because it did make first-person shooters on the console a popular thing, especially multiplayer first-person shooters on the console.

1904
02:02:14,279 --> 02:02:19,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Before, all there was, you had to have a computer and a LAN, you know, to play...

1905
02:02:20,325 --> 02:02:21,165
[SPEAKER_14]: multiplayer shooters.

1906
02:02:21,446 --> 02:02:25,328
[SPEAKER_14]: And then all of a sudden here comes Nintendo 64 with their only good game besides Zelda.

1907
02:02:25,448 --> 02:02:27,208
[SPEAKER_14]: What about Faceball 2000?

1908
02:02:27,869 --> 02:02:28,589
[SPEAKER_14]: Faceball?

1909
02:02:30,050 --> 02:02:31,070
[SPEAKER_14]: That was all over then.

1910
02:02:31,090 --> 02:02:32,391
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but it was a multiplayer game.

1911
02:02:32,411 --> 02:02:33,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a nice day.

1912
02:02:34,152 --> 02:02:36,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Sadly enough, I played through the whole game of that.

1913
02:02:37,954 --> 02:02:38,874
[SPEAKER_14]: I weep for you.

1914
02:02:40,615 --> 02:02:42,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking though, you know what I wish they had done?

1915
02:02:43,457 --> 02:02:45,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish that they had actually done the Satellaview games in the States.

1916
02:02:47,298 --> 02:02:48,279
[SPEAKER_05]: The Satellaview games.

1917
02:02:50,088 --> 02:02:53,691
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look on the bottom of your ship for Nintendo, there's this thing that will pull out.

1918
02:02:54,151 --> 02:02:55,572
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where a modem was supposed to go.

1919
02:02:56,393 --> 02:02:58,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Why isn't North and South on that list?

1920
02:03:00,976 --> 02:03:02,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, they should have done the modem thing.

1921
02:03:02,517 --> 02:03:06,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they had the best version of Zelda on that.

1922
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:07,721
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, moving on.

1923
02:03:07,741 --> 02:03:12,224
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to try to kind of jam through this list because we have some other segments left we've got to do.

1924
02:03:13,605 --> 02:03:15,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 10 was Street Fighter 2.

1925
02:03:15,606 --> 02:03:16,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, next.

1926
02:03:17,768 --> 02:03:18,128
[SPEAKER_14]: Brad, hey.

1927
02:03:18,732 --> 02:03:19,332
[SPEAKER_14]: Street Fighter 2, number 10.

1928
02:03:19,372 --> 02:03:23,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Street Fighter 2 started my first fangirl crush, other than Jed Nelson.

1929
02:03:24,014 --> 02:03:25,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Street Fighter 2 is what got me into... It was Ryu.

1930
02:03:26,195 --> 02:03:26,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

1931
02:03:26,695 --> 02:03:28,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Street Fighter 2 is what got me into arcades.

1932
02:03:28,776 --> 02:03:29,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1933
02:03:30,057 --> 02:03:31,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Street Fighter 2 is a great game.

1934
02:03:31,277 --> 02:03:31,577
[SPEAKER_15]: I love it.

1935
02:03:31,617 --> 02:03:32,157
[SPEAKER_15]: I always will.

1936
02:03:32,498 --> 02:03:37,680
[SPEAKER_15]: But it kind of is, to me, kind of like the Ms.

1937
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:38,480
[SPEAKER_15]: Pac-Man thing I said.

1938
02:03:39,500 --> 02:03:41,261
[SPEAKER_14]: It started a new type of game.

1939
02:03:42,522 --> 02:03:44,523
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of people say that Street Fighter 2 is the...

1940
02:03:47,259 --> 02:03:47,679
[SPEAKER_14]: The Pong?

1941
02:03:47,699 --> 02:03:48,079
[SPEAKER_14]: The Pong?

1942
02:04:05,782 --> 02:04:10,864
[SPEAKER_14]: but it is deserving of being on that list so it's one of those things where it's kind of more of a nod to the genre like Ms.

1943
02:04:10,884 --> 02:04:15,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Pac-Man was like there would be no Maze Game without but in that case they should have put Pac-Man not Ms.

1944
02:04:15,987 --> 02:04:25,171
[SPEAKER_14]: Pac-Man but whatever yeah so I agree that it should be near the top of the list but oh Loki thinks Loki thinks they put Ms.

1945
02:04:25,211 --> 02:04:34,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Pac-Man on the list because it got girls to play games well that's what they said in the goddamn show whatever well the whole thing about Street Fighter Street Fighter 2 is that

1946
02:04:35,228 --> 02:04:38,530
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so widely popular, but it really blew the doors open.

1947
02:04:38,610 --> 02:04:44,733
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing is, when I actually bought my own Super Nintendo, the first game I got was Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo.

1948
02:04:45,873 --> 02:04:46,594
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my game.

1949
02:04:47,895 --> 02:04:49,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was such a Ryu fan girl, and I still am.

1950
02:04:51,716 --> 02:04:53,717
[SPEAKER_14]: I used E-Honda because he was fat like me.

1951
02:04:54,778 --> 02:04:55,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1952
02:04:55,238 --> 02:04:55,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Number nine.

1953
02:04:56,799 --> 02:04:58,060
[SPEAKER_14]: StarCraft and WarCraft.

1954
02:04:58,080 --> 02:04:58,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1955
02:04:58,340 --> 02:04:58,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1956
02:05:02,829 --> 02:05:08,273
[SPEAKER_14]: If I have to play another RTS game, I will put a gun to my head and pull the trigger.

1957
02:05:09,133 --> 02:05:11,195
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't like real-time strategy games.

1958
02:05:11,915 --> 02:05:16,718
[SPEAKER_14]: And they did not... How could you say Starcraft and Warcraft are different games?

1959
02:05:16,738 --> 02:05:18,620
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they should be in the top 20, but not above Civilization.

1960
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:19,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, hell no.

1961
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:21,281
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, fucking Red Alert.

1962
02:05:21,361 --> 02:05:22,302
[SPEAKER_12]: That game rocks.

1963
02:05:22,962 --> 02:05:23,803
[SPEAKER_12]: I love Command & Conquer.

1964
02:05:23,823 --> 02:05:24,223
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.

1965
02:05:24,283 --> 02:05:27,866
[SPEAKER_14]: Command & Conquer Ghost will be a lot better, but that's a first-person shooter.

1966
02:05:28,106 --> 02:05:28,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving on.

1967
02:05:30,322 --> 02:05:32,763
[SPEAKER_05]: The only red alert that's cool is the Transformer.

1968
02:05:35,425 --> 02:05:36,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Number eight.

1969
02:05:37,426 --> 02:05:38,247
[SPEAKER_14]: Another series.

1970
02:05:38,967 --> 02:05:40,128
[SPEAKER_14]: Super Mario 64.

1971
02:05:41,349 --> 02:05:42,569
[SPEAKER_05]: That was actually very fun.

1972
02:05:42,609 --> 02:05:47,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan and I, when I first moved in with Dan, we would just spend hours all night playing Mario 64.

1973
02:05:48,072 --> 02:05:50,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Like trying to do the special jump to get to the roof.

1974
02:05:52,855 --> 02:05:55,637
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree definitely with putting Mario in the top ten.

1975
02:05:55,677 --> 02:05:57,298
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually think it ought to be higher.

1976
02:05:57,765 --> 02:05:59,286
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't agree with the game they highlighted.

1977
02:05:59,326 --> 02:06:00,947
[SPEAKER_05]: And it started at Mario Sunshine.

1978
02:06:00,987 --> 02:06:02,228
[SPEAKER_05]: We wouldn't have Mario Sunshine without it.

1979
02:06:02,388 --> 02:06:04,430
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree, but I think Mario Bros.

1980
02:06:04,670 --> 02:06:07,311
[SPEAKER_14]: 3 is the one they should have kind of picked to lead the pack.

1981
02:06:07,351 --> 02:06:08,632
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that was the best Mario game they made.

1982
02:06:10,033 --> 02:06:11,855
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I feel like Mario World better than Mario 3.

1983
02:06:14,997 --> 02:06:15,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, hold on.

1984
02:06:16,938 --> 02:06:17,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold on.

1985
02:06:18,319 --> 02:06:22,041
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Matt's saying Super Mario 64 and Sunshine are different.

1986
02:06:22,662 --> 02:06:23,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, here's why Jamie...

1987
02:06:26,474 --> 02:06:29,276
[SPEAKER_14]: made the comparison.

1988
02:06:29,536 --> 02:06:40,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Because Super Mario, as in Super Mario on Nintendo, is an original platform side-scorer game, whereas Mario 64 is a 3D platformer, and it plays differently.

1989
02:06:40,604 --> 02:06:45,107
[SPEAKER_14]: The idea is similar, but it plays completely differently, because it's in a 3D realm.

1990
02:06:45,367 --> 02:06:49,250
[SPEAKER_14]: And because of Mario 64, we have games like Monkey... What's it called?

1991
02:06:49,290 --> 02:06:50,070
[SPEAKER_14]: That PlayStation game?

1992
02:06:50,110 --> 02:06:50,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Super Monkey Ball.

1993
02:06:50,751 --> 02:06:51,251
[SPEAKER_15]: Ape Escape.

1994
02:06:51,631 --> 02:06:51,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh.

1995
02:06:52,132 --> 02:06:52,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Ape Escape.

1996
02:06:52,712 --> 02:06:53,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Another 3D platformer game.

1997
02:06:53,853 --> 02:06:55,594
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like Jak and Daxter, I think, and...

1998
02:06:55,970 --> 02:06:57,671
[SPEAKER_14]: Like these games that are pretty popular, I hear.

1999
02:06:57,931 --> 02:06:58,311
[SPEAKER_12]: Spyro.

2000
02:06:59,251 --> 02:07:01,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Spyro, I didn't really like Spyro, but it is popular.

2001
02:07:02,073 --> 02:07:04,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone always forgets about what Mario is missing.

2002
02:07:05,674 --> 02:07:08,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Because that game sucks ass!

2003
02:07:09,276 --> 02:07:09,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know what that is?

2004
02:07:10,456 --> 02:07:14,818
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Nintendo's version of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego, and it's a bad interpretation of it.

2005
02:07:15,158 --> 02:07:17,059
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we gotta move on with this list.

2006
02:07:18,101 --> 02:07:22,063
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate to say it, but if we don't get through this list, we're not going to be able to get the FUs of the week.

2007
02:07:22,443 --> 02:07:23,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, no way out.

2008
02:07:24,184 --> 02:07:25,905
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I know, we haven't even done the FUs of the week yet.

2009
02:07:26,005 --> 02:07:27,526
[SPEAKER_14]: So, number seven.

2010
02:07:28,247 --> 02:07:29,968
[SPEAKER_14]: This is, I want to see Brad's reaction to this.

2011
02:07:29,988 --> 02:07:31,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Number seven, The Sims.

2012
02:07:34,530 --> 02:07:35,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Number seven?

2013
02:07:36,491 --> 02:07:37,912
[SPEAKER_14]: And I actually agree with this.

2014
02:07:38,372 --> 02:07:40,693
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree with it because it's the top selling computer game of all time.

2015
02:07:40,713 --> 02:07:41,574
[SPEAKER_14]: Period.

2016
02:07:41,594 --> 02:07:41,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Period.

2017
02:07:42,661 --> 02:07:45,324
[SPEAKER_14]: and it's accessible to everybody.

2018
02:07:46,185 --> 02:07:49,568
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a video game that has no limits, literally.

2019
02:07:49,688 --> 02:07:55,854
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, boys, girls, men, women, children, everybody can play this game and it's very accessible and everybody has fun with it.

2020
02:07:56,234 --> 02:07:58,836
[SPEAKER_14]: The only problem with The Sims is that it has no goal.

2021
02:07:58,957 --> 02:07:59,677
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no objective.

2022
02:07:59,717 --> 02:08:00,298
[SPEAKER_14]: But in a way...

2023
02:08:00,805 --> 02:08:02,045
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of the appeal of it.

2024
02:08:02,286 --> 02:08:04,366
[SPEAKER_14]: It kind of made way for games like Animal Crossing.

2025
02:08:04,466 --> 02:08:06,327
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't that all Sid Meier's games?

2026
02:08:06,367 --> 02:08:07,387
[SPEAKER_14]: They have no goal.

2027
02:08:08,147 --> 02:08:09,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Not even Civilization has a goal.

2028
02:08:09,728 --> 02:08:11,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Sid Meier did not do The Sims, if I'm not mistaken.

2029
02:08:11,669 --> 02:08:12,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you serious?

2030
02:08:12,969 --> 02:08:14,290
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me elaborate on that.

2031
02:08:14,570 --> 02:08:18,371
[SPEAKER_12]: They actually, the PC versions have no goal.

2032
02:08:19,091 --> 02:08:22,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Overall, your goal, obviously, is to be successful and whatever.

2033
02:08:22,032 --> 02:08:27,554
[SPEAKER_12]: But in the console versions, they do have goal-oriented things in there.

2034
02:08:27,901 --> 02:08:32,544
[SPEAKER_12]: because obviously you're limited to what you can hold on the console and stuff.

2035
02:08:33,104 --> 02:08:33,725
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you say my name?

2036
02:08:34,005 --> 02:08:34,305
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2037
02:08:35,266 --> 02:08:35,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.

2038
02:08:36,606 --> 02:08:38,868
[SPEAKER_14]: Number six, Half-Life.

2039
02:08:42,010 --> 02:08:42,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Any comments?

2040
02:08:42,850 --> 02:08:43,851
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I played Half-Life.

2041
02:08:45,952 --> 02:08:47,673
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on, Matt's saying Half-Life isn't that good.

2042
02:08:49,594 --> 02:08:53,257
[SPEAKER_14]: Half-Life kind of changed first-person shooters.

2043
02:08:53,957 --> 02:08:55,318
[SPEAKER_14]: After Half-Life,

2044
02:08:55,854 --> 02:09:00,638
[SPEAKER_14]: These games started coming out kind of like, I think System Shock 2 and stuff came out after Half-Life.

2045
02:09:00,658 --> 02:09:01,198
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't remember.

2046
02:09:01,358 --> 02:09:02,379
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody could probably call me on that.

2047
02:09:02,759 --> 02:09:05,201
[SPEAKER_14]: And they started becoming more story-oriented.

2048
02:09:05,961 --> 02:09:11,786
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you had to think more instead of just straight on look and shoot, kill things.

2049
02:09:11,806 --> 02:09:15,008
[SPEAKER_14]: You had to kind of more think in a problem-solving way.

2050
02:09:16,729 --> 02:09:18,711
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I don't know if I would put it that high on the list.

2051
02:09:18,771 --> 02:09:20,252
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's way too high on the list.

2052
02:09:20,412 --> 02:09:23,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially considering the number of other FPSs they have on the list.

2053
02:09:23,732 --> 02:09:26,193
[SPEAKER_14]: Because there's another one still on the list that we haven't gotten to yet.

2054
02:09:26,213 --> 02:09:26,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, great.

2055
02:09:27,674 --> 02:09:28,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Number five.

2056
02:09:28,515 --> 02:09:29,695
[SPEAKER_14]: This is an interesting choice.

2057
02:09:29,815 --> 02:09:32,136
[SPEAKER_14]: I suppose you have to have a sports game somewhere in the top ten.

2058
02:09:32,337 --> 02:09:34,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt in 2003.

2059
02:09:35,138 --> 02:09:35,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

2060
02:09:37,219 --> 02:09:38,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Super high impact football is better.

2061
02:09:40,041 --> 02:09:41,761
[SPEAKER_15]: We're spending way much time on this game.

2062
02:09:41,801 --> 02:09:42,342
[SPEAKER_15]: Go to the next one.

2063
02:09:42,722 --> 02:09:43,863
[SPEAKER_15]: None of us play sports games.

2064
02:09:43,903 --> 02:09:44,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Give me a fucking break.

2065
02:09:45,784 --> 02:09:46,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Tecmo Bowl.

2066
02:09:46,764 --> 02:09:47,264
[SPEAKER_15]: Enough said.

2067
02:09:47,444 --> 02:09:47,785
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

2068
02:09:48,005 --> 02:09:49,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Tecmo Bowl and super high impact.

2069
02:09:51,275 --> 02:09:54,678
[SPEAKER_15]: NBA Jam, I think it's the only one I even put 10 seconds on, and that was it.

2070
02:09:58,421 --> 02:09:59,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Blitz was actually kind of funny.

2071
02:10:00,623 --> 02:10:01,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Blitz was kind of funny.

2072
02:10:03,566 --> 02:10:05,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Super Tennis on Super Nintendo, I did play that.

2073
02:10:07,469 --> 02:10:08,350
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, moving on.

2074
02:10:09,091 --> 02:10:09,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.

2075
02:10:10,432 --> 02:10:11,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Getting down to the wire.

2076
02:10:11,453 --> 02:10:12,814
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 4, Grand Theft Auto 3.

2077
02:10:13,875 --> 02:10:15,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that has to be on there.

2078
02:10:15,056 --> 02:10:17,098
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty unique.

2079
02:10:19,089 --> 02:10:21,050
[SPEAKER_14]: It's again the series highlighted by one game.

2080
02:10:21,411 --> 02:10:23,132
[SPEAKER_14]: And Vice City is just 3's engine, isn't it?

2081
02:10:24,212 --> 02:10:26,454
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice City is a little bit different, the engine.

2082
02:10:26,714 --> 02:10:35,579
[SPEAKER_14]: They upgraded the graphics a bit, and they changed... I don't know, I guess it is the same engine, maybe they just... I don't know.

2083
02:10:36,340 --> 02:10:37,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Unlimited some things in the graphics.

2084
02:10:38,321 --> 02:10:39,402
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

2085
02:10:39,502 --> 02:10:41,243
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 3, Tetris.

2086
02:10:44,805 --> 02:10:46,426
[SPEAKER_14]: I almost think it ought to be number 1.

2087
02:10:47,911 --> 02:10:48,351
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll say it.

2088
02:10:48,471 --> 02:10:49,352
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll say it.

2089
02:10:49,372 --> 02:10:50,293
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to leave now.

2090
02:10:50,333 --> 02:10:50,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Goodbye.

2091
02:10:52,014 --> 02:10:52,834
[SPEAKER_14]: That's so weird.

2092
02:10:54,735 --> 02:10:56,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Without that, we wouldn't have Tetranet.

2093
02:10:58,358 --> 02:10:59,558
[SPEAKER_14]: I ran something to contribute.

2094
02:10:59,638 --> 02:10:59,859
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2095
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:10,105
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of think that's why Mrs. Pac-Man was so high on the list, because it has kind of the same appeal as Tetris, where you could play it over and over and over, and it's different every time.

2096
02:11:10,563 --> 02:11:13,545
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to worry about graphics or anything like that.

2097
02:11:13,585 --> 02:11:16,186
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something you can take with you to work and play.

2098
02:11:16,446 --> 02:11:18,948
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to immerse yourself into a story or anything.

2099
02:11:18,988 --> 02:11:19,988
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just pick up and go.

2100
02:11:20,568 --> 02:11:21,649
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same as Tetris.

2101
02:11:22,249 --> 02:11:27,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, if I'm not mistaken, out of the 100 games on this list, this is one of only two puzzle games on the whole list.

2102
02:11:27,972 --> 02:11:28,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Puzzle Fighter 2.

2103
02:11:29,033 --> 02:11:32,515
[SPEAKER_05]: But how many puzzle games did Tetris influence?

2104
02:11:32,575 --> 02:11:34,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Columns.

2105
02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:36,637
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the one I'm thinking of?

2106
02:11:37,758 --> 02:11:39,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides Puzzle Fighter, there was...

2107
02:11:41,078 --> 02:11:46,120
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm not really disappointed with what they did put as number one, so number three is fair.

2108
02:11:46,781 --> 02:11:47,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Magical drop.

2109
02:11:47,101 --> 02:11:47,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Magical drop.

2110
02:11:48,001 --> 02:11:48,301
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

2111
02:11:49,222 --> 02:11:49,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving on.

2112
02:11:50,102 --> 02:11:50,723
[SPEAKER_14]: Number two.

2113
02:11:51,903 --> 02:11:54,664
[SPEAKER_14]: I promised there'd be another FPS on here before we got to the end.

2114
02:11:54,705 --> 02:11:55,005
[SPEAKER_14]: Doom.

2115
02:11:55,745 --> 02:11:56,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2116
02:11:57,006 --> 02:12:03,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I would come home from school, I would go back to Marcy's house, and we would play Doom all night.

2117
02:12:04,069 --> 02:12:05,830
[SPEAKER_14]: And go to the Wolfenstein level.

2118
02:12:05,930 --> 02:12:09,752
[SPEAKER_14]: I think because this game is here, Half-Life should not be on this list at all.

2119
02:12:10,012 --> 02:12:10,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2120
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:14,921
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Half-Life is... And I question Halo's presence.

2121
02:12:14,941 --> 02:12:17,962
[SPEAKER_14]: Half-Life puts more of a story into it.

2122
02:12:18,102 --> 02:12:20,743
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Matt's saying Half-Life puts more of a story into it, and I think that's why they put it there.

2123
02:12:21,024 --> 02:12:22,984
[SPEAKER_15]: But that does make you question Halo being there.

2124
02:12:23,244 --> 02:12:25,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Halo's the most successful Xbox game.

2125
02:12:26,305 --> 02:12:29,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Halo is the most successful Xbox game, is what Matt says.

2126
02:12:29,427 --> 02:12:30,107
[SPEAKER_15]: Matt Loki, Matt.

2127
02:12:31,047 --> 02:12:31,307
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold on.

2128
02:12:31,827 --> 02:12:32,288
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's the thing.

2129
02:12:33,488 --> 02:12:34,848
[SPEAKER_14]: I see what they're doing here on this list.

2130
02:12:34,868 --> 02:12:36,029
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going by genre.

2131
02:12:36,069 --> 02:12:38,950
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like they're cycling through genre games and which ones are the best in the genre.

2132
02:12:40,123 --> 02:12:42,504
[SPEAKER_15]: We might as well have just a top 20 games in each genre.

2133
02:12:42,524 --> 02:12:45,326
[SPEAKER_15]: That would have been more of a better idea, but whatever.

2134
02:12:46,606 --> 02:12:50,708
[SPEAKER_14]: Number one, and obviously somebody can guess this because it hasn't been named yet.

2135
02:12:51,088 --> 02:12:51,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Let Irene.

2136
02:12:54,270 --> 02:12:56,871
[SPEAKER_14]: And it is... Drumroll please.

2137
02:12:57,211 --> 02:12:58,292
[SPEAKER_14]: A Boy and His Bob!

2138
02:13:00,113 --> 02:13:03,174
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my choice, but it's The Legend of Zelda.

2139
02:13:03,374 --> 02:13:05,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you guess which game in the series they chose to highlight?

2140
02:13:05,955 --> 02:13:06,576
[SPEAKER_05]: The original.

2141
02:13:06,916 --> 02:13:07,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

2142
02:13:08,140 --> 02:13:08,800
[SPEAKER_14]: Link to the Past.

2143
02:13:08,840 --> 02:13:09,321
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

2144
02:13:09,521 --> 02:13:10,001
[SPEAKER_14]: Link to the Past.

2145
02:13:10,021 --> 02:13:11,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I thought you told me the original.

2146
02:13:11,522 --> 02:13:12,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

2147
02:13:12,142 --> 02:13:14,044
[SPEAKER_14]: I just heard you tell me the original.

2148
02:13:14,804 --> 02:13:15,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally guessed it.

2149
02:13:16,045 --> 02:13:20,627
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm okay with Tetris not being number one because Zelda's, you know, God.

2150
02:13:20,667 --> 02:13:22,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Link to the Past was the best of the series.

2151
02:13:22,609 --> 02:13:23,249
[SPEAKER_14]: And I agree.

2152
02:13:23,289 --> 02:13:24,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Link to the Past was the best of the series.

2153
02:13:24,830 --> 02:13:25,170
[SPEAKER_14]: Period.

2154
02:13:25,790 --> 02:13:27,852
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's better than Ocarina of Time even.

2155
02:13:28,332 --> 02:13:33,395
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think... Give Ice Queen a mic, please.

2156
02:13:36,061 --> 02:13:44,029
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd have to say that Ocarina of Time was about equal to A Link to the Past, but this new freaking Zelda that's out, compared to these other two, sucks ass.

2157
02:13:44,370 --> 02:13:46,752
[SPEAKER_13]: It's good in its own way, but not as a Zelda.

2158
02:13:47,773 --> 02:13:48,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I did.

2159
02:13:49,054 --> 02:13:54,140
[SPEAKER_13]: It's good in its own way, it's got a good story, but you're a freaking treasure hunter the whole freaking game.

2160
02:13:55,141 --> 02:13:56,562
[SPEAKER_13]: You're a goddamn treasure hunter.

2161
02:13:56,822 --> 02:13:58,144
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, but that is not Zelda.

2162
02:13:59,151 --> 02:14:01,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I probably had the most fun out of all the Zeldas.

2163
02:14:01,093 --> 02:14:01,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably playing the...

2164
02:14:27,771 --> 02:14:28,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Oracle Games on Game Boy.

2165
02:14:29,352 --> 02:14:40,298
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, I'm sad about the whole, you know, the way they did this, Legends, all the, imagine, you know, Legends all linked to the past storyline with the graphics of Wind Waker.

2166
02:14:40,778 --> 02:14:44,360
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I was imagining that I wanted, you know, out of this game.

2167
02:14:45,781 --> 02:14:49,944
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, there's still time for them to change, you know, make a new one that's like that.

2168
02:14:50,224 --> 02:14:54,266
[SPEAKER_15]: They were going in kind of a different direction as the way the gameplay flows and everything in this one.

2169
02:14:54,286 --> 02:14:57,468
[SPEAKER_14]: They wanted to go for more of a, like an anime style drama type

2170
02:14:58,719 --> 02:15:07,766
[SPEAKER_14]: And I really, really like this one, and it probably is my favorite of the... It is my favorite of, like, the 3D Zeldas, but... Different type of game, in my opinion.

2171
02:15:09,627 --> 02:15:15,732
[SPEAKER_13]: The biggest problem, and this isn't gonna be a spoiler, it might be a little bit, but the biggest problem is the fact that there are so few dungeons.

2172
02:15:16,953 --> 02:15:19,034
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the thing that killed this Zelda for me.

2173
02:15:19,755 --> 02:15:21,356
[SPEAKER_01]: There's... There's no dungeons!

2174
02:15:22,357 --> 02:15:27,561
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's great, but I spent, like, three hours in one of the dungeons once, so I don't care if there's four, five, six dungeons.

2175
02:15:27,621 --> 02:15:27,841
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean...

2176
02:15:28,168 --> 02:15:30,009
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a long time to spend in one dungeon.

2177
02:15:31,189 --> 02:15:31,650
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what, though?

2178
02:15:31,690 --> 02:15:35,591
[SPEAKER_13]: In Ocarina of Time, if you don't know what you're doing, you could easily spend three or four hours in a dungeon.

2179
02:15:35,651 --> 02:15:47,897
[SPEAKER_14]: And you had all of those that, well, yeah, the water one especially, but because of that freaking tricky little... I can see that a little bit, because I get really aggravated by those fucking caves in PSO.

2180
02:15:48,437 --> 02:15:51,418
[SPEAKER_14]: My God, you spend like five hours in those freaking caves.

2181
02:15:51,438 --> 02:15:53,299
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, chains of scenery, please.

2182
02:15:53,399 --> 02:15:54,339
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Phantasy Star Online?

2183
02:15:54,439 --> 02:15:55,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2184
02:15:55,260 --> 02:15:55,540
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

2185
02:15:56,007 --> 02:15:57,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Bionic Commando Blaster Master

2186
02:16:18,482 --> 02:16:22,803
[SPEAKER_14]: No mention of the Mega Man series at all in the top 100.

2187
02:16:23,783 --> 02:16:24,764
[SPEAKER_14]: That's my only beef.

2188
02:16:25,024 --> 02:16:27,004
[SPEAKER_14]: No Mega Mans anywhere in the top 100.

2189
02:16:27,064 --> 02:16:27,805
[SPEAKER_14]: What is up with that?

2190
02:16:28,385 --> 02:16:29,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Actraiser was not on the list.

2191
02:16:30,705 --> 02:16:33,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Chrono Trigger being so low was another one of my bitches.

2192
02:16:33,206 --> 02:16:34,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's sad.

2193
02:16:35,147 --> 02:16:36,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Was Boy This Bomb on there?

2194
02:16:36,307 --> 02:16:36,487
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

2195
02:16:36,687 --> 02:16:36,947
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

2196
02:16:37,627 --> 02:16:38,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Killed it now.

2197
02:16:40,768 --> 02:16:41,888
[SPEAKER_05]: And we could Ragnarok online.

2198
02:16:41,908 --> 02:16:42,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Why was that not on there?

2199
02:16:42,729 --> 02:16:43,469
[SPEAKER_14]: Dance Dance Revolution was 40.

2200
02:16:43,509 --> 02:16:43,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

2201
02:16:45,549 --> 02:16:45,749
Wow.

2202
02:16:46,050 --> 02:16:47,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Dance Dance Revolution was higher than Chrono Trigger.

2203
02:16:48,976 --> 02:16:51,397
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a travesty.

2204
02:16:51,457 --> 02:16:52,578
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm never going to watch G4.

2205
02:16:53,699 --> 02:16:54,339
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to bomb them.

2206
02:16:54,519 --> 02:16:56,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Phantasy Star was on the list, actually.

2207
02:16:56,720 --> 02:16:58,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody's bitching about Phantasy Star.

2208
02:16:58,481 --> 02:17:01,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Phantasy Star was... I might have skipped over it.

2209
02:17:01,203 --> 02:17:01,923
[SPEAKER_14]: It was in the beginning.

2210
02:17:01,963 --> 02:17:02,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, kids.

2211
02:17:02,443 --> 02:17:02,583
[SPEAKER_14]: It was 76.

2212
02:17:02,723 --> 02:17:06,706
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell kind of crack addict loser printed up that list?

2213
02:17:06,966 --> 02:17:09,707
[SPEAKER_14]: They put Chrono Trigger underneath the money?

2214
02:17:09,867 --> 02:17:12,249
[SPEAKER_14]: G4 TV and Entertainment Weekly.

2215
02:17:12,289 --> 02:17:13,489
[SPEAKER_14]: You can address those card readers.

2216
02:17:13,669 --> 02:17:15,810
[SPEAKER_14]: You people from those companies, you're losers.

2217
02:17:15,830 --> 02:17:18,572
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't know what the hell you're talking about, and you should try playing video games.

2218
02:17:19,252 --> 02:17:20,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on, Entertainment Weekly?

2219
02:17:21,033 --> 02:17:24,416
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't even know what a video game is, so why are they doing a list like this?

2220
02:17:24,436 --> 02:17:25,676
[SPEAKER_14]: It's why they partnered with G4.

2221
02:17:25,877 --> 02:17:28,959
[SPEAKER_14]: But G4 doesn't even know what a video game is, apparently, you know?

2222
02:17:30,060 --> 02:17:31,861
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole entire Puyo Puyo series.

2223
02:17:32,801 --> 02:17:35,824
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I understand putting Tetris on there, but Puyo Puyo played so differently.

2224
02:17:36,624 --> 02:17:45,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I played, you know, Kirby's Avalanche, and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, and where was Sonic Adventure?! !

2225
02:17:45,953 --> 02:17:48,177
[SPEAKER_14]: and even Sonic was lower than it should have been.

2226
02:17:49,299 --> 02:17:50,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Very, very good mention.

2227
02:17:50,942 --> 02:17:53,126
[SPEAKER_14]: Multiple people in the chat room are saying this, Earthbound.

2228
02:17:56,973 --> 02:17:57,834
[SPEAKER_14]: It should have been a mention.

2229
02:17:58,014 --> 02:17:59,614
[SPEAKER_14]: I can see why it would not be in the top 50.

2230
02:18:00,074 --> 02:18:01,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Because nobody knows about it.

2231
02:18:02,295 --> 02:18:03,415
[SPEAKER_14]: I disagree.

2232
02:18:03,835 --> 02:18:05,956
[SPEAKER_14]: It's one of the hugest cult video games out there.

2233
02:18:06,376 --> 02:18:07,236
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's a cult video game.

2234
02:18:07,256 --> 02:18:07,776
[SPEAKER_14]: Twisted Metal 2.

2235
02:18:07,836 --> 02:18:11,598
[SPEAKER_14]: They were obviously going for games that people know about.

2236
02:18:11,778 --> 02:18:13,658
[SPEAKER_14]: And I never even heard about EarthBound until I met you.

2237
02:18:14,378 --> 02:18:18,659
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the fact that it's one of the biggest cult games of all time ought to put it on there.

2238
02:18:18,679 --> 02:18:20,900
[SPEAKER_01]: What about Final Fantasy Mystic Quest?

2239
02:18:21,220 --> 02:18:24,141
[SPEAKER_14]: And people will know EarthBound soon because it's coming out on Game Boy Advance.

2240
02:18:26,030 --> 02:18:26,311
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2241
02:18:26,391 --> 02:18:26,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

2242
02:18:29,251 --> 02:18:30,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, another excellent mention.

2243
02:18:30,752 --> 02:18:32,452
[SPEAKER_14]: Illusion of Gaia and that whole series.

2244
02:18:32,592 --> 02:18:32,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Nowhere.

2245
02:18:32,853 --> 02:18:33,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Soul Blazer.

2246
02:18:33,873 --> 02:18:36,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Soul Blazer was not mentioned.

2247
02:18:36,234 --> 02:18:36,794
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

2248
02:18:36,854 --> 02:18:38,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Smash Brothers wasn't on there.

2249
02:18:38,174 --> 02:18:38,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope, wasn't.

2250
02:18:39,315 --> 02:18:40,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Guardian Legend.

2251
02:18:41,055 --> 02:18:41,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Guardian Legend.

2252
02:18:41,715 --> 02:18:43,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, my game is not on the list.

2253
02:18:43,836 --> 02:18:44,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn those people.

2254
02:18:44,916 --> 02:18:47,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's not get dank and run over G4.

2255
02:18:47,237 --> 02:18:52,098
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to give you guys some time to foam and get pissy over the top 100 list.

2256
02:18:52,118 --> 02:18:52,759
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on.

2257
02:18:52,979 --> 02:18:53,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

2258
02:18:53,299 --> 02:18:53,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2259
02:18:53,579 --> 02:18:53,779
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2260
02:18:55,555 --> 02:18:57,737
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want to hear my opinion about what game should have been number one?

2261
02:18:57,897 --> 02:18:58,057
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

2262
02:18:58,077 --> 02:18:59,358
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you don't, but I'm going to say anyway.

2263
02:18:59,498 --> 02:18:59,698
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

2264
02:18:59,718 --> 02:19:00,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Civilian Knight, of course.

2265
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:02,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

2266
02:19:02,660 --> 02:19:04,682
[SPEAKER_05]: The Japanese version with the better voice acting.

2267
02:19:04,922 --> 02:19:05,922
[SPEAKER_05]: The Saturn version.

2268
02:19:06,603 --> 02:19:09,385
[SPEAKER_14]: We're running a little low on time, so I'm going to kick us over to break.

2269
02:19:09,905 --> 02:19:10,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2270
02:19:10,225 --> 02:19:15,169
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we've done 7th style music, 8th style music, and 9th style music, so let's do some 6th style music.

2271
02:19:15,849 --> 02:19:17,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we ever announce a cage match winner?

2272
02:19:17,370 --> 02:19:17,951
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we didn't.

2273
02:19:18,111 --> 02:19:19,292
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to announce a cage match winner?

2274
02:19:19,872 --> 02:19:20,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking Matt.

2275
02:19:21,092 --> 02:19:22,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's Mona Lisa Overdrive again.

2276
02:19:22,853 --> 02:19:23,373
[SPEAKER_14]: Hooray!

2277
02:19:23,613 --> 02:19:25,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but you can't win again.

2278
02:19:27,195 --> 02:19:29,296
[SPEAKER_14]: First time... Shut up!

2279
02:19:30,397 --> 02:19:32,358
[SPEAKER_14]: First time a song has been in for four weeks.

2280
02:19:32,378 --> 02:19:35,179
[SPEAKER_14]: And by the way, another landslide vote for that one.

2281
02:19:35,259 --> 02:19:37,580
[SPEAKER_14]: So, uh, good job for Mona Lisa Overdrive.

2282
02:19:37,640 --> 02:19:41,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Kylie... Alright.

2283
02:19:41,702 --> 02:19:43,303
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Mona Lisa Overdrive wins KTMG again.

2284
02:19:43,583 --> 02:19:45,184
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so we're going to do some stick style songs.

2285
02:19:45,624 --> 02:19:49,046
[SPEAKER_14]: And when we come back... Jamie, is there a stick style song you want to hear?

2286
02:19:49,066 --> 02:19:49,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

2287
02:19:52,521 --> 02:19:53,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Similar to my mind, right?

2288
02:19:54,161 --> 02:19:54,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

2289
02:19:54,822 --> 02:19:55,342
[SPEAKER_05]: It's depressing.

2290
02:19:55,522 --> 02:19:55,962
[SPEAKER_05]: It's goth.

2291
02:19:56,483 --> 02:19:59,004
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're just going to do two six-style songs.

2292
02:19:59,024 --> 02:20:03,226
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to come back and do the FUs of the week because we haven't done those yet.

2293
02:20:03,386 --> 02:20:04,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Surprise, surprise.

2294
02:20:04,167 --> 02:20:07,468
[SPEAKER_14]: So hurry up and send those to me over private message in the chat room.

2295
02:20:07,508 --> 02:20:08,189
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Sky.

2296
02:20:08,229 --> 02:20:09,469
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got to keep it short this week.

2297
02:20:09,509 --> 02:20:11,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Please keep your FUs of the week short, chat room.

2298
02:20:12,911 --> 02:20:14,812
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we'll be back in a little bit.

2299
02:20:33,052 --> 02:20:34,074
Thanks for watching!

2300

Thanks for watching!

2304
02:24:19,618 --> 02:24:20,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge Radio.

2305
02:24:21,199 --> 02:24:23,360
[SPEAKER_14]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

2306
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:24,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, kids.

2307
02:24:24,460 --> 02:24:25,901
[SPEAKER_14]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2308
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:38,621
[SPEAKER_14]: and gosh, it's awfully late in the show to start this, but you know, that list was just so much fun.

2309
02:24:40,361 --> 02:24:41,042
[SPEAKER_14]: What can we say?

2310
02:24:42,422 --> 02:24:43,542
[SPEAKER_14]: It's time for the FUs of the Week.

2311
02:24:43,582 --> 02:24:45,682
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, what are the FUs of the Week all about?

2312
02:24:46,263 --> 02:24:47,943
[SPEAKER_05]: We get pissy and tell stuff off.

2313
02:24:48,163 --> 02:24:49,443
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so here we go.

2314
02:24:49,943 --> 02:24:51,364
[SPEAKER_14]: It's time to start the FUs of the Week.

2315
02:24:58,225 --> 02:24:58,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

2316
02:24:59,885 --> 02:25:02,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time I listen to this, I still get, like, happy.

2317
02:25:02,366 --> 02:25:02,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheers.

2318
02:25:05,494 --> 02:25:09,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the fact is that it goes toward idiot drivers who nearly run over me.

2319
02:25:09,496 --> 02:25:14,659
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes toward the entire parking lot at Arden Fair Mall, because I nearly got hit a bunch of times.

2320
02:25:14,699 --> 02:25:19,581
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, it also goes toward me, you know, just being nervous in general.

2321
02:25:20,301 --> 02:25:23,083
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it goes toward being exhausted and not being able to sleep.

2322
02:25:24,223 --> 02:25:32,047
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it goes toward the person on Ragnarok Online who kept casting the ice spell and blocking all the paths and lagging me.

2323
02:25:32,941 --> 02:25:35,462
[SPEAKER_05]: So, other than that, I'm not really all that angsty.

2324
02:25:35,662 --> 02:25:37,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very happy because I'm going to have a new live journal.

2325
02:25:38,663 --> 02:25:39,803
[SPEAKER_05]: A pretty new live journal layout.

2326
02:25:39,843 --> 02:25:41,003
[SPEAKER_14]: It is very pretty, I've seen it.

2327
02:25:41,403 --> 02:25:42,624
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very Transformery.

2328
02:25:43,484 --> 02:25:44,864
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know another one.

2329
02:25:46,105 --> 02:25:50,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Another fuck you goes toward all of those dubbed Headmasters episodes.

2330
02:25:50,646 --> 02:26:02,129
[SPEAKER_05]: When I'm trying to find Japanese episodes, or, you know, raw ones, or ones that are subtitled, and instead I'm finding either the crappy three episodes they did in the States, which I already own, or...

2331
02:26:03,030 --> 02:26:05,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, those bad dubs that they did.

2332
02:26:05,912 --> 02:26:07,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Horrible dubs of Headmasters.

2333
02:26:09,314 --> 02:26:10,315
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Transformers.

2334
02:26:11,636 --> 02:26:14,938
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that pisses me off.

2335
02:26:16,439 --> 02:26:19,962
[SPEAKER_05]: And another one goes toward me not being able to find another Hot Rod so I can have it at work.

2336
02:26:20,943 --> 02:26:21,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.

2337
02:26:24,945 --> 02:26:25,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2338
02:26:26,266 --> 02:26:27,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

2339
02:26:28,848 --> 02:26:31,130
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, um... F you to, uh...

2340
02:26:32,902 --> 02:26:39,248
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I guess I should have done something other than just pat him in, you know, bubble wrap and write fragile, mm-hmm.

2341
02:26:58,581 --> 02:27:03,265
[SPEAKER_12]: So I can't get my money back from her, but I'm going to give her one hell of a negative feedback on eBay.

2342
02:27:04,546 --> 02:27:10,771
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, that wasted $15, plus the fact that I was overdrawn twice, so my bank charged me $60 for those records.

2343
02:27:11,371 --> 02:27:14,754
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was a loss of $75 total for $15 for the records.

2344
02:27:17,636 --> 02:27:20,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, at least my Eddie Murphy record works.

2345
02:27:20,478 --> 02:27:21,399
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to bend it back.

2346
02:27:22,840 --> 02:27:25,182
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so that's the one I wanted anyways.

2347
02:27:25,789 --> 02:27:38,078
[SPEAKER_14]: And then finally, in world news, FB to the dumb, uh, I don't know what nationality you are, but Middle Eastern bitch that's bitching in Florida about the fact that you have to remove your veil to take a driver's license photo.

2348
02:27:38,318 --> 02:27:40,120
[SPEAKER_12]: Listen, bitch, you look like a fucking ninja.

2349
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:43,422
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to, like, take the damn veil off or just quit driving.

2350
02:27:43,522 --> 02:27:47,485
[SPEAKER_14]: I better, yeah, why don't you just deport your ass over to, you know, the Middle East where you belong.

2351
02:27:47,966 --> 02:27:51,168
[SPEAKER_14]: So, uh, yeah, sorry, I don't, I wanted to sound like some kind of, like,

2352
02:27:51,966 --> 02:27:54,567
[SPEAKER_14]: I just have three words, four words Separation of church and state

2353
02:28:21,658 --> 02:28:21,958
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm done.

2354
02:28:22,359 --> 02:28:22,939
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all I had.

2355
02:28:23,500 --> 02:28:30,905
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what you meant by that, but okay.

2356
02:28:30,985 --> 02:28:35,909
[SPEAKER_14]: My FU of the week goes to my SARS, my never-ending case of SARS, and my brain tumor.

2357
02:28:37,491 --> 02:28:38,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck you, Irene.

2358
02:28:38,091 --> 02:28:39,412
[SPEAKER_14]: My other FU goes to Irene.

2359
02:28:39,932 --> 02:28:46,137
[SPEAKER_14]: And my next FU goes to the fact that I had, what, something like five, six drinks, and I was drunk for maybe like two minutes.

2360
02:28:47,218 --> 02:28:47,779
[SPEAKER_11]: At the most.

2361
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:49,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Sucked.

2362
02:28:52,052 --> 02:28:58,495
[SPEAKER_14]: It may have seemed like two minutes to you, but I remember you and like Matt and Irene freaking jumping around being all silly.

2363
02:28:58,555 --> 02:28:59,956
[SPEAKER_14]: It was probably more like an hour.

2364
02:29:00,456 --> 02:29:01,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Irene like tripped.

2365
02:29:02,297 --> 02:29:07,899
[SPEAKER_14]: She says she tripped, but it looks to me like she just did a Superman fly dive thing towards the emergency exit.

2366
02:29:07,939 --> 02:29:08,880
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really interesting.

2367
02:29:10,100 --> 02:29:13,222
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's move on to other folks in the room's FUs of the week.

2368
02:29:15,663 --> 02:29:16,723
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, Brad?

2369
02:29:18,344 --> 02:29:20,665
[SPEAKER_15]: FU goes to this segment because I really don't like it.

2370
02:29:22,713 --> 02:29:23,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Irene.

2371
02:29:24,736 --> 02:29:25,317
[SPEAKER_14]: FUs of the week.

2374
02:29:40,270 --> 02:29:40,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you, dude.

2375
02:29:42,031 --> 02:29:44,113
[SPEAKER_14]: That's part of my view I totally forgot about.

2376
02:29:44,394 --> 02:29:55,104
[SPEAKER_15]: I was driving home from, after dropping Rob and Matt off at their place, at Rob's place, I was driving around and my tire went flat and my CV half shaft in the front right of my car blew out.

2377
02:29:55,144 --> 02:29:56,626
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's a couple hundred dollars of a...

[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually feel sick, is the thing.

2380
02:30:27,021 --> 02:30:27,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel sick.

2381
02:30:28,822 --> 02:30:32,986
[SPEAKER_05]: And, like, fuck not having access to my PTO until another two months.

2382
02:30:34,107 --> 02:30:38,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I would so just stay home and, like, cough up all my lungs and then feel better.

[SPEAKER_05]: I have insurance.

2384
02:30:40,973 --> 02:30:41,954
[SPEAKER_05]: My insurance kicked in today.

2385
02:30:41,974 --> 02:30:43,256
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, is that it?

2388

2401
02:31:13,020 --> 02:31:13,940
[SPEAKER_13]: It's overpriced.

2402
02:31:14,480 --> 02:31:17,121

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Loki.

2460
02:34:48,450 --> 02:35:03,095
[SPEAKER_12]: Once again, and you only have three hours left, you will go instantly, right now, not waiting one second, and go vote for The Legend of Trance on Bomani style, and you will vote a ten, and you will like it.

2461
02:35:04,336 --> 02:35:04,756
[SPEAKER_14]: That is all.

2462
02:35:06,036 --> 02:35:08,397
[SPEAKER_14]: And that would be the remix contest, yet?

2463
02:35:08,557 --> 02:35:11,638
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, you want them to vote The Legend of Trance and Dark Black Forest, both tens.

2464
02:35:13,294 --> 02:35:14,094
[SPEAKER_14]: That is correct.

2465
02:35:15,215 --> 02:35:15,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Where are you?

2466
02:35:17,756 --> 02:35:18,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, what are you ranked right now?

2467
02:35:19,637 --> 02:35:20,478
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I'm like fifth.

2468
02:35:21,778 --> 02:35:22,339
[SPEAKER_14]: Unacceptable.

2469
02:35:25,220 --> 02:35:26,361
[SPEAKER_14]: I still get a CD.

2470
02:35:28,942 --> 02:35:34,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, other things that you can do, you can vote our station of five in your Live365 player window, because we love the ratings.

2471
02:35:35,105 --> 02:35:39,568
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can also pour out our listening hours by listening to us all day long.

2472
02:35:40,828 --> 02:35:42,289
[SPEAKER_05]: La la, la la.

2473
02:35:44,557 --> 02:35:47,041
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so let's do the Orange Crush thingy.

2476
02:36:01,386 --> 02:36:04,307
[SPEAKER_14]: It's time to ask questions during Orange Crush.

2477
02:36:04,407 --> 02:36:04,727
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay!

2478
02:36:05,188 --> 02:36:06,588

[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone's leaving.

2484
02:36:10,451 --> 02:36:10,591
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2485
02:36:10,631 --> 02:36:12,732
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, I don't want to do Orange Crush.

2486
02:36:12,772 --> 02:36:13,272
[SPEAKER_06]: It sucks.

2487
02:36:13,892 --> 02:36:16,013

02:36:17,914 --> 02:36:21,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so the theme of this one is foreplay.

[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, these are questions about Osamu Kubota.

2495
02:36:27,521 --> 02:36:27,841
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2496
02:36:27,941 --> 02:36:29,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and then Matt's like, oh, fuck, I'm screwed.

2497
02:36:30,183 --> 02:36:33,745
[SPEAKER_06]: But, okay, so does anyone have a timer for 30 seconds?

2498
02:36:33,825 --> 02:36:34,125
[SPEAKER_14]: I do.

2499
02:36:34,306 --> 02:36:34,706

02:37:32,833 --> 02:37:34,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so how many did Matt get?

2543
02:37:36,114 --> 02:37:37,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he got none of them right.

2544
02:37:37,715 --> 02:37:38,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Matt got none of them right.

2545
02:37:38,896 --> 02:37:39,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2546
02:37:39,936 --> 02:37:43,578
[SPEAKER_14]: So, then we're ready to bring in Jamie.

2547
02:37:43,778 --> 02:37:45,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but she's going potty right now.

2548
02:37:45,599 --> 02:37:46,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Jamie ready?

2549
02:37:47,499 --> 02:37:48,160
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's a no.

2550
02:37:48,420 --> 02:37:48,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

2551
02:37:49,792 --> 02:37:52,033
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do some more Orange Crush It's time to crush the Orange Crush

2552
02:38:06,414 --> 02:38:12,235
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in an intermission right now because we're waiting for contestant number two.

2553
02:38:12,255 --> 02:38:15,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me ask, do people like Orange Crush?

2554
02:38:15,436 --> 02:38:17,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this going to be a regular segment?

2555
02:38:17,716 --> 02:38:19,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Are the people in the chatroom digging it?

2556
02:38:19,916 --> 02:38:22,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I've got a lot of material.

2557
02:38:23,477 --> 02:38:24,657
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they like it.

2558
02:38:24,797 --> 02:38:25,617
[SPEAKER_14]: They like you, Irene.

2559
02:38:25,637 --> 02:38:26,158
[SPEAKER_14]: They really like you.

2560
02:38:26,698 --> 02:38:27,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Aw, thanks.

2561
02:38:27,718 --> 02:38:28,598
[SPEAKER_07]: You love me.

2562
02:38:28,738 --> 02:38:30,258
[SPEAKER_07]: You really love me.

2563
02:38:30,778 --> 02:38:31,759
[SPEAKER_14]: Hand the mic over to Brad.

2564
02:38:31,919 --> 02:38:33,799
[SPEAKER_14]: He has an idea and I'm scared, but

2565
02:38:37,119 --> 02:38:49,586
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like with the nature of these questions and stuff, and obviously the lack of knowledge that our contestants have on these questions, we might should be able to change the length of the time or whatever to 45 seconds.

2566
02:38:51,187 --> 02:38:51,747
[SPEAKER_03]: But not now.

2567
02:38:51,767 --> 02:38:52,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Not now.

2568
02:38:54,049 --> 02:39:00,112
[SPEAKER_15]: That's production notes, but I'm allowed to give that out since we're sitting here waiting forever.

2569
02:39:00,232 --> 02:39:03,134
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know, what else am I thinking in regards to Orange Crush?

2570
02:39:04,083 --> 02:39:06,044
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to do Orange Jeopardy one week on the show.

2571
02:39:06,304 --> 02:39:10,587
[SPEAKER_14]: If you thought that G4 thing took forever on the show, I want to do Orange Jeopardy.

2572
02:39:10,607 --> 02:39:12,628
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I give a hint about another Orange Crush?

2573
02:39:13,808 --> 02:39:15,029
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's another thing I don't like about it.

2574
02:39:15,129 --> 02:39:20,752
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like you're giving specific categories about certain people and stuff that have no friggin' clue about what the hell's going on.

2575
02:39:20,952 --> 02:39:21,813
[SPEAKER_12]: It needs to be multiple.

2576
02:39:22,133 --> 02:39:23,614
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on, hold on.

2577
02:39:23,634 --> 02:39:24,214
[SPEAKER_14]: Multiple choice?

2578
02:39:25,322 --> 02:39:27,804
[SPEAKER_12]: It needs to either be multiple choice or it needs to be something else.

2579
02:39:27,824 --> 02:39:28,504
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a good idea.

2580
02:39:28,544 --> 02:39:30,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we should try multiple choice sometime.

2581
02:39:30,906 --> 02:39:32,447
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know nor care.

2582
02:39:32,907 --> 02:39:34,088
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's the thing, Matt.

2583
02:39:34,248 --> 02:39:38,311
[SPEAKER_15]: We understand that people aren't going to know a lot of the answers to these questions.

2584
02:39:38,331 --> 02:39:40,812
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of why we're doing it because it's kind of like a knowledge thing.

2585
02:39:40,832 --> 02:39:43,714
[SPEAKER_14]: We're teaching people out there who might have... People don't want to learn.

2586
02:39:43,734 --> 02:39:44,715
[SPEAKER_14]: They just want to watch.

2587
02:39:45,035 --> 02:39:52,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Some people are fanatics about some of the artists and so they like to know and they like to hear these things like birthdates of the artists.

2588
02:39:52,740 --> 02:39:53,080
[SPEAKER_14]: I think...

2589
02:39:53,686 --> 02:39:54,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, time to go.

2590
02:39:54,487 --> 02:39:55,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, here we go.

2591
02:39:56,108 --> 02:39:59,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you going to fill Jamie in on what tonight's... Oh, hi.

2592
02:39:59,050 --> 02:39:59,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Fill me what?

2593
02:40:00,911 --> 02:40:01,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Fill Jamie up.

2594
02:40:03,533 --> 02:40:09,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, the theme of tonight, Jamie, is called Foreplay, and these are questions about Osamu Kubota.

2595
02:40:10,418 --> 02:40:11,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I read his website.

2596
02:40:12,039 --> 02:40:12,439
[SPEAKER_05]: You did.

2597
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:14,521
[SPEAKER_05]: And you should know.

2598
02:40:14,561 --> 02:40:16,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll probably get them wrong because I don't remember.

2599
02:40:16,582 --> 02:40:18,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so do you have the time set?

2600
02:40:19,244 --> 02:40:19,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2601
02:40:20,005 --> 02:40:21,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Three, two, one, go.

2602
02:40:22,106 --> 02:40:22,767
[SPEAKER_06]: What year was he born?

2603
02:40:26,604 --> 02:40:28,225
[SPEAKER_05]: 74.

2604
02:40:27,365 --> 02:40:28,225
[SPEAKER_05]: What's his blood type?

2605
02:40:30,007 --> 02:40:34,209
[SPEAKER_05]: A. What tax song was Osamu Kubota consulted on?

2606
02:40:34,589 --> 02:40:34,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Era.

2607
02:40:35,810 --> 02:40:36,831
[SPEAKER_05]: What's his two main hobbies?

2608

[SPEAKER_05]: French and music.

2609
02:40:41,494 --> 02:40:42,955
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the name of his production house?

2610
02:40:43,395 --> 02:40:45,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Kubota Productions.

2611
02:40:48,682 --> 02:40:48,982
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2612
02:40:49,943 --> 02:40:51,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Both of you got none of them right.

2613
02:40:52,185 --> 02:40:52,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yeah.

2614
02:40:53,445 --> 02:40:55,847
[SPEAKER_06]: He was born in 74, 72.

2615
02:40:56,447 --> 02:40:55,847
1965.

2616
02:40:56,928 --> 02:40:57,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2617
02:40:57,388 --> 02:40:57,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2618
02:40:57,968 --> 02:40:58,429
[SPEAKER_06]: He was born in 1965.

2619
02:40:58,529 --> 02:41:01,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll relay, I'll relay.

2620
02:41:02,552 --> 02:41:03,953
[SPEAKER_15]: You ask the questions, I'll relay the answers.

2621
02:41:04,373 --> 02:41:05,253
[SPEAKER_07]: What's his blood type?

2622
02:41:06,654 --> 02:41:08,556
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to say O. No, it's AB.

2623
02:41:09,716 --> 02:41:10,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost said AB.

2624
02:41:11,177 --> 02:41:11,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2625
02:41:11,498 --> 02:41:12,078
[SPEAKER_05]: You were close.

2626
02:41:12,158 --> 02:41:12,358
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2627
02:41:12,378 --> 02:41:13,239
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's AB, yeah.

2628
02:41:14,795 --> 02:41:17,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, what tax song was Osomo Kubota consulted on?

2629
02:41:18,038 --> 02:41:20,260
[SPEAKER_15]: I know this one, Steal My Words.

2630
02:41:20,480 --> 02:41:22,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he did the piano part for Steal My Words.

2631
02:41:23,563 --> 02:41:24,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, what are his two main hobbies?

2632
02:41:25,685 --> 02:41:27,547
[SPEAKER_15]: Cooking and traveling, right?

2633
02:41:27,827 --> 02:41:28,348
[SPEAKER_06]: That's correct.

2634
02:41:28,908 --> 02:41:34,273
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the name of his... Men and women, Matt?

2635
02:41:34,974 --> 02:41:35,935
[SPEAKER_14]: That's his two hobbies?

2636
02:41:37,026 --> 02:41:37,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe.

2637
02:41:37,447 --> 02:41:40,731
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if you take a look at him, he's kind of a mixture of the two.

2638
02:41:40,951 --> 02:41:41,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, okay.

2639
02:41:41,972 --> 02:41:44,135
[SPEAKER_06]: And what is the name of his production house?

2640
02:41:44,155 --> 02:41:45,036
[SPEAKER_06]: This is really interesting.

2641
02:41:45,056 --> 02:41:46,198
[SPEAKER_14]: This is very interesting, guys.

2642
02:41:46,498 --> 02:41:46,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Listen.

2643
02:41:48,220 --> 02:41:48,481
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob?

2644
02:41:49,081 --> 02:41:49,322
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2645
02:41:50,223 --> 02:41:51,845
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the name of his production house?

2646
02:41:52,025 --> 02:41:52,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Good Cool.

2647
02:41:52,766 --> 02:41:54,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's the name of his production house.

2648
02:41:54,608 --> 02:41:55,830
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, think about that for a second.

2649
02:41:55,850 --> 02:41:55,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2650
02:41:56,471 --> 02:41:57,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we know who Good Cool is.

2651
02:42:27,136 --> 02:42:28,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I was talking Kubota live.

2652
02:42:28,937 --> 02:42:29,617
[SPEAKER_14]: That's cool.

2653
02:42:29,857 --> 02:42:30,417
[SPEAKER_15]: Good cool.

2654
02:42:31,178 --> 02:42:31,478
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

2655
02:42:32,138 --> 02:42:34,319
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, so, yeah.

2656
02:42:34,739 --> 02:42:35,219
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

2657
02:42:35,319 --> 02:42:38,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to ask how tall he was, but that's kind of a boring question.

2658
02:42:38,681 --> 02:42:39,301
[SPEAKER_06]: How tall is he?

2659
02:42:39,341 --> 02:42:39,701
[SPEAKER_06]: He's 5'8".

2660
02:42:39,721 --> 02:42:40,721
[SPEAKER_14]: He's Japanese, so he's short.

2661
02:42:40,741 --> 02:42:41,282
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm almost the same.

2662
02:42:41,302 --> 02:42:43,903
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's more interesting than the blood type question, but you know.

2663
02:42:44,103 --> 02:42:44,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, okay.

2664
02:42:46,223 --> 02:42:46,504
[SPEAKER_14]: What's that?

2665
02:42:47,444 --> 02:42:47,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he is.

2666
02:42:48,004 --> 02:42:49,865
[SPEAKER_06]: He's fluent in French and English.

2667
02:42:49,945 --> 02:42:53,586
[SPEAKER_06]: But the blood typing is, that's a common thing, like a Japanese thing.

2668
02:42:53,706 --> 02:42:55,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Japanese really care about...

2669
02:42:57,378 --> 02:42:57,998
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, I know.

2670
02:42:58,019 --> 02:42:58,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

2671
02:42:58,639 --> 02:43:00,180
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's an interesting fact.

2672
02:43:00,220 --> 02:43:02,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's something that is not going to be on everyone else's website.

2673
02:43:03,022 --> 02:43:06,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, when you go to Japan, you don't ask girls, what's your sign?

2674
02:43:06,164 --> 02:43:07,185
[SPEAKER_14]: You say, what's your blood type?

2675
02:43:07,225 --> 02:43:09,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and his sign's Gemini, because he was born in June.

2676
02:43:09,787 --> 02:43:10,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, anyway.

2677
02:43:14,290 --> 02:43:15,010
[SPEAKER_14]: What's your blood type?

2678
02:43:15,130 --> 02:43:16,271
[SPEAKER_14]: Mmm, tasty.

2679
02:43:16,932 --> 02:43:20,734
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I was born in June, and I'm a Cancer.

2680
02:43:21,555 --> 02:43:23,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, you are a Cancer.

2681
02:43:23,376 --> 02:43:24,717
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a Cancer on society.

2682
02:43:24,737 --> 02:43:25,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, exactly.

2683
02:43:26,482 --> 02:43:31,303
[SPEAKER_06]: So that concludes another episode of Orange Crush.

2684
02:43:31,904 --> 02:43:34,744
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the end of Orange Crush.

2685
02:43:34,784 --> 02:43:38,425
[SPEAKER_06]: We really need to make a real song for it or something.

2686
02:43:38,525 --> 02:43:39,206
[SPEAKER_14]: One of these days.

2687
02:43:39,486 --> 02:43:40,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I love your version, Rob.

2688
02:43:40,986 --> 02:43:41,386
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2689
02:43:41,406 --> 02:43:41,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2690
02:43:41,886 --> 02:43:43,247
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate that.

2691
02:43:43,307 --> 02:43:44,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Your hair's still there.

2692
02:43:44,367 --> 02:43:46,588
[SPEAKER_14]: So now we have a little time to kill.

2693
02:43:46,808 --> 02:43:47,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Shit, we could have done listless.

2694
02:43:48,088 --> 02:43:49,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, no, because we would have had to rush through it.

2695
02:43:49,528 --> 02:43:52,409
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're kind of stuck with a little bit of time here.

2696
02:43:52,429 --> 02:43:53,770
[SPEAKER_06]: We're stuck with Rob.

2697
02:43:54,110 --> 02:43:55,010
[SPEAKER_03]: We're stuck with Rob.

2698
02:43:55,856 --> 02:44:06,406
[SPEAKER_14]: I can talk about, uh, something about that, that list of, oh, no, we were talking about what game people would like to see a sequel to, what Final Fantasy game, and I was thinking about this while I was having a cigarette.

2699
02:44:07,107 --> 02:44:13,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, Matt says Final Fantasy 3, I'm gonna go around and see who, uh, who thinks what, what should be done.

2700
02:44:13,813 --> 02:44:20,179
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Rob, what, what Final Fantasy, and this could be any game with the name Final Fantasy in it, do you think should be a sequel, have a sequel done?

2701
02:44:23,408 --> 02:44:25,610
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm tempted to say eight, so they can do it right.

2702
02:44:27,713 --> 02:44:31,897
[SPEAKER_14]: But honestly, four, if any of them.

2703
02:44:32,037 --> 02:44:32,618
[SPEAKER_07]: You geek.

2704
02:44:33,979 --> 02:44:37,003
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's a great choice, because four had a really interesting story.

2705
02:44:37,303 --> 02:44:39,145
[SPEAKER_14]: Two in America, yes, for those who... Four was depressing.

2706
02:44:40,006 --> 02:44:41,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it was pretty depressing, but...

2707
02:44:43,357 --> 02:44:48,120
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, what else could go wrong in my life?

2708
02:44:50,202 --> 02:44:52,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Final Fantasy VI, you don't know what happened to Terra.

2709
02:44:52,643 --> 02:44:54,384
[SPEAKER_13]: Because she's like my bitch.

2710
02:44:55,305 --> 02:44:58,167
[SPEAKER_14]: They need to do a sequel to Final Fantasy VI.

2711
02:44:58,187 --> 02:45:00,128
[SPEAKER_14]: They can explain the goddamn ending.

2712
02:45:01,409 --> 02:45:06,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, because it alludes to the fact that when the statues are destroyed that Terra might disappear.

2713
02:45:07,253 --> 02:45:07,813
[SPEAKER_13]: But she might not.

2714
02:45:07,873 --> 02:45:10,435
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't freaking give you any clues to what actually happens to her.

2715
02:45:11,334 --> 02:45:16,117
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry for the lack of spoiler warning, but if you haven't beaten it by now, we figure, you're probably not going to.

2716
02:45:16,938 --> 02:45:21,981
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't matter if spoilers are given, because that game is excellent, and you should play it no matter what.

2717
02:45:22,061 --> 02:45:26,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, as far as RPG games are concerned, you have to play that game.

2718
02:45:26,204 --> 02:45:27,245
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't really spoil anything.

2719
02:45:27,545 --> 02:45:30,927
[SPEAKER_13]: That game is so good, I've had it since it came out, and I have played it like a million times.

2720
02:45:30,987 --> 02:45:33,069
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, just like a couple of weeks ago, I started playing it again.

2721
02:45:33,189 --> 02:45:35,190
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah, that game is like so awesome.

2722
02:45:36,451 --> 02:45:36,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2723
02:45:37,251 --> 02:45:38,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Three, or six, whatever, you know.

2724
02:45:39,073 --> 02:45:39,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, maybe.

2725
02:45:45,153 --> 02:46:00,704
[SPEAKER_12]: 8.

2726
02:45:47,875 --> 02:46:00,704
[SPEAKER_12]: They should make 8 because, I don't know, they were talking about making 9 was supposed to be a sequel to 8 where they're gonna have, uh, it was gonna follow around the party of, uh, wasn't it the same, like, Lagunas or something like that?

2727
02:46:00,824 --> 02:46:01,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, uh, Laguna?

2728
02:46:02,025 --> 02:46:02,585
[SPEAKER_12]: Laguna, yeah.

2729
02:46:02,605 --> 02:46:06,768
[SPEAKER_15]: No spoils because we have somebody in the room that hasn't seen the end of 8.

2730
02:46:06,808 --> 02:46:10,291
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm talking about Irene here, so...

2731
02:46:10,911 --> 02:46:11,851
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't have anything.

2732
02:46:12,191 --> 02:46:14,272
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying they were supposed to follow around Laguna.

2733
02:46:14,372 --> 02:46:16,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you talking about 9 before it was made?

2734
02:46:16,932 --> 02:46:20,273
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they were talking about like, it was going to be done in the Point of View of Laguna.

2735
02:46:20,933 --> 02:46:21,333
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, weird.

2736
02:46:21,793 --> 02:46:24,794
[SPEAKER_14]: I have an interesting rumor that went around when 8 was being produced.

2737
02:46:25,114 --> 02:46:29,515
[SPEAKER_14]: The first time, the first bit of information was given out about 8, it was just two pictures.

2738
02:46:29,955 --> 02:46:30,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Three pictures, I'm sorry.

2739
02:46:31,195 --> 02:46:34,235
[SPEAKER_14]: The logo, a picture of Laguna, and a picture of Squall.

2740
02:46:34,456 --> 02:46:35,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Two male characters.

2741
02:46:35,636 --> 02:46:36,896
[SPEAKER_14]: And people were looking at the logo...

2742
02:46:37,329 --> 02:46:38,089
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard Rinoa had crabs.

2743
02:46:38,109 --> 02:46:39,310
[SPEAKER_14]: She probably does at frickin'...

2744
02:47:07,751 --> 02:47:13,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, um, does Jamie have an opinion about, oh, hold on, Rob's going next, hold on.

2745
02:47:13,315 --> 02:47:17,217
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I just wanted to say, if they did do that for Final Fantasy VIII, it would be the best video game of all time.

2746
02:47:17,257 --> 02:47:18,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Number one on G4's list, baby.

2747
02:47:20,219 --> 02:47:22,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a Final Fantasy VIII that's good.

2748
02:47:24,883 --> 02:47:27,324
[SPEAKER_05]: With much more squall, because squall's pretty.

2749
02:47:28,345 --> 02:47:32,127
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want, like, Irvine's selfie, you know, happy.

2750
02:47:34,269 --> 02:47:35,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Irvine's cool, he has a gun.

2751
02:47:37,670 --> 02:47:39,171
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree with Jamie wholeheartedly.

2752
02:47:39,211 --> 02:47:39,771
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know what?

2753
02:47:40,532 --> 02:47:42,453
[SPEAKER_14]: I've said many times before and I'm going to say it again.

2754
02:47:42,753 --> 02:47:44,014
[SPEAKER_14]: The movie should have been 8.

2755
02:47:44,394 --> 02:47:46,435
[SPEAKER_14]: 8 should have been the movie.

2756
02:47:48,216 --> 02:47:51,938
[SPEAKER_14]: And what he means by that is the story in 8 should have been the actual movie.

2757
02:47:51,978 --> 02:47:56,320
[SPEAKER_05]: The one that was with Final Fantasy the movie shouldn't have had anything to do with Final Fantasy at all.

2758
02:47:56,460 --> 02:47:57,761
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so, anywho.

2759
02:47:57,981 --> 02:47:58,821
[SPEAKER_15]: Kind of like Mystic Quest.

2760
02:47:59,081 --> 02:48:02,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Mystic Quest was like Final Fantasy for babies.

2761
02:48:04,412 --> 02:48:05,773
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll tell you what Mystic Quest is.

2762
02:48:05,973 --> 02:48:08,014
[SPEAKER_14]: In Japan, it's called Final Fantasy USA.

2763
02:48:08,215 --> 02:48:08,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2764
02:48:12,497 --> 02:48:15,559
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know what the Final Fantasy VII in America was considered over there?

2765
02:48:16,700 --> 02:48:18,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy VII International.

2766
02:48:18,981 --> 02:48:20,582
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm playing Final Fantasy X International.

2767
02:48:20,883 --> 02:48:27,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is like, basically it's as easy as Final Fantasy X, the Japanese version, but in English.

2768
02:48:28,656 --> 02:48:30,437
[SPEAKER_15]: and it has a few extra features, I heard.

2769
02:48:30,717 --> 02:48:31,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.

2770
02:48:31,257 --> 02:48:31,817
[SPEAKER_15]: No, the extra DVD.

2771
02:48:31,837 --> 02:48:34,959
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the difficulty of your sphere grid and that's about it.

2772
02:48:35,139 --> 02:48:36,479
[SPEAKER_14]: The DVD, the extra DVD.

2773
02:48:36,539 --> 02:48:37,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine didn't come with DVD.

2774
02:48:37,940 --> 02:48:41,282
[SPEAKER_14]: They were supposed to release a separate DVD when you, maybe it was if you pre-ordered it.

2775
02:48:41,462 --> 02:48:43,002
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine, I've already got it subtitled.

2776
02:48:43,122 --> 02:48:46,064
[SPEAKER_14]: It was, it was a, um, like an extra end story.

2777
02:48:46,084 --> 02:48:47,464
[SPEAKER_05]: It's you running around being retarded.

2778
02:48:48,144 --> 02:48:48,525
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well.

2779
02:48:48,545 --> 02:48:49,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

2780
02:48:49,905 --> 02:48:50,866
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't seen it yet, so.

2781
02:48:50,966 --> 02:48:52,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll show it to you, I'll copy it for you.

2782
02:48:52,326 --> 02:48:56,148
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have it subtitled if anyone on their chat room or... Hold on, what's that say?

2783
02:48:58,237 --> 02:49:03,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, now I watched in the show preview video for Final Fantasy X2 on G4.

2784
02:49:03,300 --> 02:49:03,860
[SPEAKER_12]: No spoilers.

2785
02:49:04,520 --> 02:49:05,281
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, this is no spoiler.

2786
02:49:05,321 --> 02:49:06,822
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, it makes no sense.

2787
02:49:07,582 --> 02:49:11,825
[SPEAKER_12]: The whole video, all it is, is Riona... Riona?

2788
02:49:11,965 --> 02:49:12,625
[SPEAKER_12]: Or, not Riona.

2789
02:49:12,985 --> 02:49:13,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Yuna?

2790
02:49:13,726 --> 02:49:14,406
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever, Yuna.

2791
02:49:14,986 --> 02:49:15,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Some Japanese... Yuna Croft.

2792
02:49:16,287 --> 02:49:16,927
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, anyway.

2793
02:49:17,348 --> 02:49:19,869
[SPEAKER_12]: Yuna... Doing karaoke.

2794
02:49:20,469 --> 02:49:21,050
[SPEAKER_12]: Singing.

2795
02:49:21,070 --> 02:49:21,710
[SPEAKER_12]: Just singing.

2796
02:49:22,110 --> 02:49:23,091
[SPEAKER_12]: Like some pop idol.

2797
02:49:23,131 --> 02:49:27,113
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like... I was watching it... No, she's singing like a pop idol, and I'm watching it going...

2798
02:49:27,577 --> 02:49:28,737
[SPEAKER_12]: Are they going to show anything else?

2799
02:49:29,618 --> 02:49:32,418
[SPEAKER_12]: No, okay, well this is interesting.

2800
02:49:32,438 --> 02:49:47,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Did anybody see the, what was it, the Star Wars, I think it was a Lucasfilm, the little LucasArts computer game intro thing where all the stormtroopers were doing like a dance or whatever?

2801
02:49:47,223 --> 02:49:47,403
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

2802
02:49:47,463 --> 02:49:48,703
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, what does that have to do with it?

2803
02:49:48,743 --> 02:49:51,344
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was funny, so it's a way to promote the game.

2804
02:49:51,364 --> 02:49:52,485
[SPEAKER_12]: It showed nothing interesting.

2805
02:49:54,269 --> 02:49:55,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing of the game.

2806
02:49:55,530 --> 02:49:58,773
[SPEAKER_12]: They're supposed to be previewing the game to show me, to give me interest in playing the game.

2807
02:49:58,953 --> 02:50:01,455
[SPEAKER_14]: All I saw were singing, like, the main theme.

2808
02:50:01,535 --> 02:50:05,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you seen the Metal Gear Solid 2 commercial in Japan with Gackt in it?

2809
02:50:05,058 --> 02:50:05,458
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

2810
02:50:05,478 --> 02:50:09,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Has nothing to do with it, but it's Gackt, and so people are gonna be like, No, this has been in our chatroom.

2811
02:50:09,681 --> 02:50:12,483
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, we're making fun of the Final Fantasy and other story.

2812
02:50:13,384 --> 02:50:18,948
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, Marin is saying, uh, Yuna's going, Waka, your stomach is fat, lolololol.

2813
02:50:19,409 --> 02:50:20,490
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, shut the fuck up.

2814
02:50:21,330 --> 02:50:22,231
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2815
02:50:22,731 --> 02:50:23,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Randomness.

2816
02:50:47,304 --> 02:50:49,065
[SPEAKER_15]: Matt says, depends on how X2 ends.

2817
02:50:53,768 --> 02:50:54,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Get the book.

2818
02:50:55,289 --> 02:50:58,211
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't given my idea, my opinion.

2819
02:50:58,792 --> 02:51:04,075
[SPEAKER_15]: This is where I came up with the idea of asking everybody is because I was out there and I was thinking, what about other games in the Final Fantasy series?

2820
02:51:04,640 --> 02:51:07,442
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they should do a sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics.

2821
02:51:07,782 --> 02:51:10,904
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody who's played Final Fantasy Tactics would go, what the fuck?

2822
02:51:10,944 --> 02:51:15,728
[SPEAKER_14]: You play the game ten times through, the story is so convoluted that you're just like, huh?

2823
02:51:16,068 --> 02:51:17,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of like Mission Impossible 1, but worse.

2824
02:51:19,690 --> 02:51:25,034
[SPEAKER_14]: And, I mean, the game was... No, there was a... Matt says there was no story.

2825
02:51:25,474 --> 02:51:30,938
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a huge, great, deep story, but you have to play the game so many times, and I think it was kind of...

2826
02:51:31,440 --> 02:51:33,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Final Fantasy Tactics Advance

2827
02:51:54,096 --> 02:51:55,537
[SPEAKER_14]: You're a little kid that gets sucked into... Yes.

2828
02:51:55,757 --> 02:52:01,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is about a kid in the present day, and he gets sucked into the world of Final Fantasy Tactics.

2829
02:52:01,879 --> 02:52:03,620
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's cars and stuff at the beginning.

2830
02:52:03,700 --> 02:52:04,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Kids getting sucked.

2831
02:52:05,560 --> 02:52:07,561
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, does that turn you on, you little pedophile?

2832
02:52:07,701 --> 02:52:13,784
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be cool to do a Final Fantasy Tactics, but in, like, the Final Fantasy VII world.

2833
02:52:14,664 --> 02:52:18,265
[SPEAKER_15]: There... Well, Cloud showed up in Final Fantasy Tactics, and so there was some... Gay.

2834
02:52:19,646 --> 02:52:20,366
[SPEAKER_15]: No, not gay.

2835
02:52:20,406 --> 02:52:21,867
[SPEAKER_15]: Cloud was one of the strongest characters, if you...

2836
02:52:23,137 --> 02:52:23,858
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2837
02:52:44,556 --> 02:52:47,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Have, like, a Cloud Vincent Yaoi Fest.

2838
02:52:47,437 --> 02:52:48,297
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be awesome.

2839
02:52:49,197 --> 02:52:50,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to have some good Cloud Vincent Yaoi.

2840
02:52:50,997 --> 02:52:59,659
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, there is, because they have, in the game, they have a scene where they show Vincent before he got, like, all messed up, and he's, like, in this suit, and he's all, like, you know, suave.

2841
02:52:59,719 --> 02:53:04,139
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what about the whole scene where he goes... I didn't spoil.

2842
02:53:04,319 --> 02:53:06,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Cloud goes into that one box... No, no spoiler.

2843
02:53:07,900 --> 02:53:12,021
[SPEAKER_14]: What about the scene where, like, Cloud has his shirt off, and he's, you know, walking... Never mind.

2844
02:53:15,706 --> 02:53:17,067
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't say that on the radio.

2845
02:53:18,748 --> 02:53:22,590
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, I know, I'm just saying what Rice Princess just said, I would not say on the radio.

2846
02:53:23,010 --> 02:53:24,050
[SPEAKER_15]: No, Matt, don't say it.

2847
02:53:24,691 --> 02:53:24,931
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

2848
02:53:28,152 --> 02:53:28,853
Shh.

2849
02:53:29,573 --> 02:53:30,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, no, shh.

2850
02:53:31,114 --> 02:53:32,835
[SPEAKER_15]: God, Matt, stop it.

2851
02:53:33,703 --> 02:53:37,445
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, Rice Princess is trying to say a bunch of spoilers about Seven.

2852
02:53:37,765 --> 02:53:42,928
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that everybody should have already played Final Fantasy 7, but I think there are people that might not have.

2853
02:53:43,249 --> 02:53:45,870
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not giving the microphone to Matt, he's going to ruin something.

2854
02:53:46,791 --> 02:53:47,071
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

2855
02:53:47,411 --> 02:53:51,033
[SPEAKER_12]: The fact that... Give me the mic.

2856
02:53:51,574 --> 02:53:54,175
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, by the way, Aeris dies, just so you know.

2857
02:53:54,895 --> 02:53:57,357
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my favorite part of the damn game.

2858
02:53:58,067 --> 02:54:05,790
[SPEAKER_08]: I have my game saved right there so that I can watch her die over and over and over again and I cheer every time.

2859
02:54:06,710 --> 02:54:07,731
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot what it is I call it.

2860
02:54:07,751 --> 02:54:27,098
[SPEAKER_14]: You should call it like a scum-sucking crack whore and a homewrecker and a man-stealer because here's why I'm not getting mad at you guys because I'm pretty sure that nobody listening hasn't played the game or had the story spoiled already so

2861
02:54:28,237 --> 02:54:30,098
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if we had the whole world listening to us right now.

2862
02:54:33,081 --> 02:54:34,942
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, hold on.

2863
02:54:35,943 --> 02:54:37,104
[SPEAKER_15]: What did Irene say?

2864
02:54:37,124 --> 02:54:41,748
[SPEAKER_06]: She said, what about in the future when they have millions of listeners and they do a rebroadcast of this show?

2865
02:54:41,968 --> 02:54:45,931
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess I'm going to have to make this episode just disappear somehow.

2866
02:54:46,852 --> 02:54:47,592
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll bleep it out.

2867
02:54:47,632 --> 02:54:50,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, at the end of this episode, we're lost on the way over.

2868
02:54:50,915 --> 02:54:52,916
[SPEAKER_03]: So the train animators finished it.

2869
02:54:55,874 --> 02:55:01,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and, you know, because millions of people are going to want to sit there and tune in and listen to us go, Fuck, shit, hell, whore, porno.

2870
02:55:01,678 --> 02:55:02,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Speaking of porno.

2871
02:55:03,440 --> 02:55:04,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh-oh, we had to get porno in.

2872
02:55:05,701 --> 02:55:08,824
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw the best porno of all time this week.

2873
02:55:09,704 --> 02:55:10,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Whore of the Rings.

02:55:11,105 --> 02:55:11,766
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to see it.

2875
02:55:11,866 --> 02:55:12,326
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, my God.

2876
02:55:12,386 --> 02:55:13,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Will you guys bring it over?

2877
02:55:18,551 --> 02:55:19,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it was the best.

2878
02:55:20,132 --> 02:55:21,373
[SPEAKER_14]: All I have to say is they have that guy.

2879
02:55:21,813 --> 02:55:24,475
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a guy playing golem, and he has a dick for a nose.

[SPEAKER_14]: That'll be the highlight of next week's show.

02:55:57,955 --> 02:55:58,875
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll watch that live on it.

2883
02:55:59,536 --> 02:56:01,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you try to not open it until next Sunday's show?

2884
02:56:02,837 --> 02:56:03,998
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think you'll be able to resist.

2885
02:56:04,038 --> 02:56:04,918
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think any of us will.

2886
02:56:05,218 --> 02:56:11,181
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be like having the freaking Pandora's box sitting right in front of us with DDR cosplay porn.

2887
02:56:11,301 --> 02:56:14,823
[SPEAKER_14]: But we have to watch this on next week's show.

[SPEAKER_14]: Where do you want me to take it?

2889
02:56:16,744 --> 02:56:19,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's switch mics.

2890
02:56:21,806 --> 02:56:22,727
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't say you could have that.

2891
02:56:28,713 --> 02:56:29,854
[SPEAKER_05]: This thing is great.

2892
02:56:30,034 --> 02:56:30,374
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2893
02:56:30,474 --> 02:56:36,837
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a coyote.

2894
02:56:38,658 --> 02:56:38,998
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

2895
02:56:39,418 --> 02:56:41,779
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, does anybody else have a quick topic?

2896
02:56:42,359 --> 02:56:44,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Otherwise, I'm just going to go to final thoughts, I think.

2897
02:56:44,160 --> 02:56:44,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Boobs.

2898
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:45,341
[SPEAKER_14]: Boobs?

2899
02:56:45,361 --> 02:56:46,141
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to talk about boobs?

2900
02:56:46,261 --> 02:56:46,861
[SPEAKER_14]: What about boobs?

2901
02:56:47,101 --> 02:56:48,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Boobs are funny, but dicks are funnier.

2902
02:56:49,442 --> 02:56:50,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Why are they funny?

2903
02:56:50,263 --> 02:56:51,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they look funny.

2904
02:56:53,924 --> 02:56:54,265
Why?

2905
02:57:00,985 --> 02:57:03,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway... I seriously think that they're funny looking.

2906
02:57:03,827 --> 02:57:08,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, repeat that again, Brad?

2907
02:57:08,310 --> 02:57:09,371
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what looks phallic?

2908
02:57:10,271 --> 02:57:11,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Your shower curtain.

2909
02:57:11,272 --> 02:57:14,094
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?

2910
02:57:14,194 --> 02:57:16,436
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean... Loki bought it.

2911
02:57:17,276 --> 02:57:25,142
[SPEAKER_05]: It's... I swear, it looks like... It looks... Doesn't it look like a dick?

2912
02:57:30,996 --> 02:57:33,677
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, so everybody's... Yeah, this is great radio, you guys.

2913
02:57:33,697 --> 02:57:35,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob's shower curtain has a bunch of dicks on it.

2914
02:57:36,138 --> 02:57:37,219
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki bought it.

2915
02:57:37,719 --> 02:57:38,359
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no, no, no.

2916
02:57:38,459 --> 02:57:38,919
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, here.

2917
02:57:39,880 --> 02:57:41,120
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't even circle in there.

2918
02:57:41,660 --> 02:57:43,581
[SPEAKER_14]: My girlfriend bought that for us, okay?

2919
02:57:48,323 --> 02:57:49,783
[SPEAKER_12]: And this does not look like a penis.

2920
02:57:50,704 --> 02:57:52,564
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like a cow or a lock.

2921
02:57:52,944 --> 02:57:54,445
[SPEAKER_13]: You're right, it doesn't look like a penis.

2922
02:57:54,485 --> 02:57:55,505
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like several of them.

2923
02:57:57,046 --> 02:57:57,126
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

2924
02:57:58,375 --> 02:58:04,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody, I don't know, if you haven't seen it yet, go look at, um, uh, what's his name, Geiger?

2925
02:58:05,456 --> 02:58:05,636
[SPEAKER_14]: H.R.

2926
02:58:05,676 --> 02:58:06,036
[SPEAKER_14]: Geiger.

2927
02:58:06,096 --> 02:58:06,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at H.R.

2928
02:58:06,676 --> 02:58:07,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Geiger's works.

2929
02:58:08,077 --> 02:58:09,697
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody should make a shower curtain out of one of H.R.

2930
02:58:10,057 --> 02:58:11,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Geiger's paintings.

2931
02:58:11,437 --> 02:58:16,958
[SPEAKER_14]: The one with all the dicks and vaginas sticking to each other, and it's like a big mosaic thing of it.

2932
02:58:17,038 --> 02:58:18,639
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really mosaic.

2933
02:58:19,179 --> 02:58:19,939
[SPEAKER_15]: Mosaic.

2934
02:58:21,019 --> 02:58:22,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Brad, I think that's supposed to be birds.

2935
02:58:23,839 --> 02:58:24,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's supposed to be birds.

2936
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:27,280
[SPEAKER_05]: The birds that turn into more birds.

2937
02:58:29,605 --> 02:58:34,606
[SPEAKER_12]: What the hell is up with Enter the Matrix and all the hidden hack stuff in there?

2938
02:58:34,926 --> 02:58:36,987
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, they have a whole thing... What was their name?

2939
02:58:37,007 --> 02:58:38,287
[SPEAKER_12]: Seraphine or something like that?

2940
02:58:38,647 --> 02:58:38,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2941
02:58:39,207 --> 02:58:39,447
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

2942
02:58:39,688 --> 02:58:43,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, they have a recording of her going, Hello, lover.

2943
02:58:44,109 --> 02:58:47,489
[SPEAKER_12]: I have an itch in a place that I cannot scratch.

2944
02:58:48,470 --> 02:58:50,490
[SPEAKER_12]: I need your nails on my back.

2945
02:58:51,550 --> 02:58:54,171
[SPEAKER_15]: And... I like asparagus.

2946
02:58:54,511 --> 02:58:54,931
[SPEAKER_15]: And also...

2947
02:58:58,391 --> 02:59:00,613
[SPEAKER_15]: I only have asparagus for lunch.

2948
02:59:01,774 --> 02:59:03,455
[SPEAKER_12]: What the hell is that supposed to mean?

2949
02:59:04,956 --> 02:59:07,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Because asparagus is penis-shaped, too.

2950
02:59:07,398 --> 02:59:07,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2951
02:59:09,780 --> 02:59:11,502
[SPEAKER_05]: It is kind of phallic.

2952
02:59:14,184 --> 02:59:14,504
[SPEAKER_05]: It does?

2953
02:59:16,826 --> 02:59:18,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't go around smelling urine, thank you.

2954
02:59:19,808 --> 02:59:22,531
[SPEAKER_05]: He informed me that asparagus makes your pee stink.

2955
02:59:22,951 --> 02:59:23,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2956
02:59:23,171 --> 02:59:24,212
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of what it is.

2957
02:59:26,463 --> 02:59:30,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I have a late FU of the week that somehow I didn't get before, my bad.

2958
02:59:33,289 --> 02:59:37,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Tyrant would like to say FU to my ISP for not allowing me into the chat room.

2959
02:59:38,854 --> 02:59:39,274
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

2960
02:59:39,715 --> 02:59:42,958
[SPEAKER_14]: FU to OtherSideIRC because it's been screwing up all day anyway.

2961
02:59:43,778 --> 02:59:49,844
[SPEAKER_14]: FU to my uncanny ability to get to be really great friends with women but not be able to have a relationship with my own.

2962
02:59:50,164 --> 02:59:50,524
[SPEAKER_14]: Frown.

2963
02:59:51,365 --> 02:59:53,447
[SPEAKER_14]: FU to school, I'm ready to be done, I don't want to do finals.

2964
02:59:57,264 --> 03:00:04,107
[SPEAKER_14]: The Game Shits The Calories You Burn While Burninating The Ice Queen I need more alcohol in my life

2965
03:00:22,370 --> 03:00:22,931
[SPEAKER_13]: And sex.

2966
03:00:23,251 --> 03:00:23,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Lots of sex.

2967
03:00:24,071 --> 03:00:24,972
[SPEAKER_13]: What about violence?

2968
03:00:24,992 --> 03:00:25,633
[SPEAKER_13]: Then you'll have all three.

2969
03:00:25,653 --> 03:00:26,953
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been six months!

2970
03:00:27,154 --> 03:00:27,634
[SPEAKER_14]: Boo-hoo.

2971
03:00:28,254 --> 03:00:28,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Shut up, bitch.

2972
03:00:30,756 --> 03:00:32,117
[SPEAKER_14]: Rice Princess, your final thought?

2973
03:00:32,918 --> 03:00:33,938
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see if we can get a mic over there.

2974
03:00:39,262 --> 03:00:42,365
[SPEAKER_06]: It borrows into the ground.

2975
03:00:43,065 --> 03:00:44,046
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I'm going to say.

2976
03:00:48,629 --> 03:00:50,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait, but that's on the website, isn't it?

2977
03:00:50,550 --> 03:00:51,211
[SPEAKER_03]: No, in the game.

2978
03:00:51,778 --> 03:00:53,439
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm doing a thief.

2979
03:00:55,922 --> 03:00:56,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I must not have it yet.

2980
03:00:56,962 --> 03:00:57,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Here.

2981
03:01:00,866 --> 03:01:02,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, explanation of that, real quick.

2982
03:01:03,428 --> 03:01:09,993
[SPEAKER_14]: Ragnarok Online, the thief class has a skill named Hide, and Ragnarok Online has such bad anguish in it, like the entire script is horrible.

2983
03:01:10,774 --> 03:01:14,417
[SPEAKER_14]: It hides by borrowing into the ground, or whatever.

2984
03:01:14,777 --> 03:01:15,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Borrowing in the ground.

2985
03:01:16,078 --> 03:01:19,001
[SPEAKER_14]: I only like to borrow in the ground, I don't like borrowing above ground, thanks.

2986
03:01:20,442 --> 03:01:21,463
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what the hide skill does.

2987
03:01:21,843 --> 03:01:23,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, that's boring, so here.

2988
03:01:23,724 --> 03:01:24,584
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, your final thought?

2989
03:01:25,485 --> 03:01:34,809
[SPEAKER_12]: My final thought is, if you're really, really, really, really desperate, I got this really cool pop-up ad today when I was browsing hacker sites.

2990
03:01:35,249 --> 03:01:36,850
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, one of those porno pop-ups.

2991
03:01:37,311 --> 03:01:44,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, it's this adult, what was it, like adultfinder or something like that, dot com or something like that.

2992
03:01:44,454 --> 03:01:48,176
[SPEAKER_12]: And you go and you register and you can find people that just want to have sex.

2993
03:01:49,315 --> 03:01:50,256
[SPEAKER_12]: In your area.

2994
03:01:50,496 --> 03:01:52,117
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's gay, straight, everything.

2995
03:01:52,197 --> 03:01:53,519
[SPEAKER_15]: That's kind of like Gay.com.

2996
03:01:54,760 --> 03:01:58,222
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, yeah, but... You know this from experience, Brad?

2997
03:01:58,242 --> 03:02:02,906
[SPEAKER_13]: The problem with Gay.com in Sacramento is that everybody's already fucked everybody else.

2998
03:02:03,947 --> 03:02:05,428
[SPEAKER_15]: Doesn't mean you can't have more sex.

2999
03:02:05,488 --> 03:02:08,291
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, what, you have sex once, and then it's like, oh, can't have sex again, sorry.

3000
03:02:08,431 --> 03:02:08,851
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that it?

3001
03:02:10,132 --> 03:02:10,693
[SPEAKER_14]: That is all.

3002
03:02:11,934 --> 03:02:12,894
[SPEAKER_14]: You want me to go, or you want to go?

3003
03:02:13,475 --> 03:02:13,815
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll go.

3004
03:02:14,276 --> 03:02:16,798
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to just take my final thought from AZHB.

3005
03:02:16,898 --> 03:02:17,198
[SPEAKER_14]: He says,

3006
03:02:17,665 --> 03:02:22,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Asparagus only smells bad if your gene for smelling asparagus-laden pee is dominant.

3007
03:02:23,846 --> 03:02:25,686
[SPEAKER_04]: That must be why mine doesn't stink.

3008
03:02:27,267 --> 03:02:28,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Your final thought, Jamie?

3009
03:02:33,548 --> 03:02:34,788
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm never going to ask her again.

3010
03:02:36,248 --> 03:02:40,849
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought, for real, is... Give me a dollar!

3011
03:02:41,829 --> 03:02:43,010
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

3012
03:02:43,190 --> 03:02:43,690
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

3024
03:03:15,992 --> 03:03:37,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Extra Cheese Pizza Party at your house, I went just to check it out 19 Extra Lodges, what a shame, no one came Just us, eating all alone

3025
03:03:38,140 --> 03:03:55,466
[SPEAKER_02]: You said take the pizza home, no sense letting all this go to waste So then I faced pizza all day and every day This cheese round the clock is getting me blocked And I sure don't care for irregularities

3026
03:03:57,079 --> 03:04:01,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me, why'd you have to go and make me so constipated?

3027
03:04:01,802 --> 03:04:19,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause right now I'd do anything to just get my bowels evacuated In the bathroom, I sit and I wait and I strain and I sweat and I clench and I feel the pain Oh, should I take a laxative or have my colon irrigated?

3028
03:04:20,074 --> 03:04:21,935
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no

3029
03:04:24,975 --> 03:04:41,879

3030
03:04:42,467 --> 03:04:56,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kissing her so tenderly, but woe is me Who would have guessed her family crest I'd suddenly spy, tattooed on her thigh And son of a gun, it's just like the one on me

3031
03:04:58,274 --> 03:05:02,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me, how was I supposed to know we were both related?

3032
03:05:03,037 --> 03:05:11,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe me, if I knew she was my cousin, we never would have dated What to do now?

3033
03:05:11,382 --> 03:05:20,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I go ahead and propose and get hitched and have kids with eleven toes And move to Alabama where that kind of thing is tolerated?

3034
03:05:21,049 --> 03:05:22,469
No, no, no

3035
03:05:34,750 --> 03:05:35,351

03:08:20,980 --> 03:08:23,762
[SPEAKER_14]: There's really not a lot to say for Afterbirth, I don't think.

3059
03:08:25,703 --> 03:08:27,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anybody else have anything they want to say for Afterbirth?

3080
03:10:39,620 --> 03:10:44,121
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's not even at the reception, that's actually at the actual ceremony.

3081
03:10:44,261 --> 03:10:57,383
[SPEAKER_03]: God, Eddie Murphy sucks.

3082
03:10:57,563 --> 03:11:03,884
[SPEAKER_12]: This girl has seen me in the club, just hanging out and dancing.

3083
03:11:04,624 --> 03:11:05,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

3084
03:11:06,825 --> 03:11:08,505

[SPEAKER_03]: That was beautiful!

3088
03:11:41,920 --> 03:11:42,480
[SPEAKER_15]: Enough of that.

3089
03:11:42,880 --> 03:11:45,101
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to give Rob the biggest high five for that comment.

3090
03:11:45,381 --> 03:11:47,301
[SPEAKER_15]: That was comic gold.

3091
03:11:47,901 --> 03:11:48,701
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god.

3092
03:11:48,721 --> 03:11:54,702
[SPEAKER_15]: I gotta go change my shorts, that was too funny.

3093
03:11:54,722 --> 03:11:56,843
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what, our afterbursts keep getting better and better.

3094
03:11:57,643 --> 03:11:58,323
[SPEAKER_14]: They really do.

3095
03:11:58,803 --> 03:12:02,124
[SPEAKER_15]: That started out pretty slow, but that... I think we should end it now.

3096
03:12:02,364 --> 03:12:03,144
[SPEAKER_15]: End it while we're ahead.

3097
03:12:06,384 --> 03:12:07,285
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't put that on.

3098
03:12:07,945 --> 03:12:08,085
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

3099
03:12:11,502 --> 03:12:12,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Put on your clothes!

3100
03:12:12,442 --> 03:12:13,143
[SPEAKER_15]: Put on your clothes!

3101
03:12:13,303 --> 03:12:14,363
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Matt, put your clothes back on.

3102
03:12:18,185 --> 03:12:19,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, wait, we're doing another vinyl?

3103
03:12:22,346 --> 03:12:22,887
[SPEAKER_14]: I scare.

3104
03:12:23,087 --> 03:12:24,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Is Loki gonna sing along to this?

3105
03:12:26,548 --> 03:12:28,169
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, start your recorders now.

3106
03:12:28,489 --> 03:12:30,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Start your recording now, because I'm not recording.

3107
03:12:31,110 --> 03:12:37,072
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the fucking lyrics to this song.

3108
03:12:37,673 --> 03:12:38,713
[SPEAKER_15]: He's gonna get the lyrics.

3109
03:12:38,873 --> 03:12:39,874
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't do it without laughing.

3110
03:12:39,894 --> 03:12:40,634
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to do this.

3111
03:12:42,188 --> 03:12:45,009
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're going to torture us with this music, you have to please sing with it.

3112
03:12:46,510 --> 03:12:47,650
[SPEAKER_15]: And then do the speed mix.

3113
03:12:51,012 --> 03:12:53,573
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that's... We don't want to use that dog too much.

3114
03:12:55,574 --> 03:12:56,134
[SPEAKER_15]: One trick, puppy.

3115
03:12:56,494 --> 03:12:56,994
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, god.

3116
03:12:57,014 --> 03:12:58,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

3117
03:12:58,195 --> 03:13:02,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you recording?

3118
03:13:02,776 --> 03:13:03,917
[SPEAKER_01]: We have it still on fast.

3119
03:13:06,158 --> 03:13:06,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

3120
03:13:14,674 --> 03:13:18,376
[SPEAKER_12]: Why did you make me do that?

3121
03:13:19,537 --> 03:13:28,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know how to... I don't even know when it kicks in because it's... Just take it, Jesus.

3122
03:13:28,623 --> 03:13:30,944
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't play the instrumental version, did you?

3123
03:13:30,964 --> 03:13:32,545
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I picked the extended mix.

3124
03:13:42,850 --> 03:13:44,111
[SPEAKER_14]: You pick the extended mix.

3125
03:13:44,772 --> 03:13:46,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, let me fix it.

3126
03:13:48,035 --> 03:13:50,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it on the other side.

3127
03:13:51,678 --> 03:13:52,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, fine.

3128
03:13:53,380 --> 03:13:54,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki ruining everything.

3129
03:13:54,241 --> 03:13:54,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Good.

3130
03:13:54,701 --> 03:13:56,243
[SPEAKER_14]: More time for people to start their recording.

3131
03:13:57,924 --> 03:13:58,465
[SPEAKER_12]: Ah, here we go.

3132
03:13:58,485 --> 03:13:59,326
[SPEAKER_12]: This should probably work.

3133
03:13:59,606 --> 03:13:59,906
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

3134
03:14:00,026 --> 03:14:01,408
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, here we go.

3135
03:14:03,489 --> 03:14:04,410
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this the real version now?

3136
03:14:04,430 --> 03:14:05,091
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the real version.

3137
03:14:05,111 --> 03:14:05,351
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

3138
03:14:05,632 --> 03:14:06,052
[SPEAKER_14]: It better be.

3139
03:14:18,937 --> 03:14:22,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm happy because I'm not the one making that ass up.

3140
03:14:22,640 --> 03:14:22,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

3141
03:14:23,341 --> 03:14:24,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this because I want to play my music?

3142
03:14:24,942 --> 03:14:25,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, you are.

3143
03:14:25,603 --> 03:14:27,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, where the hell are the lyrics?

3144
03:14:27,084 --> 03:14:28,205
Loki, your vinyl sucks my ass.

3145
03:14:52,463 --> 03:14:59,752
[SPEAKER_16]: Peter Duel, The Blonde Waitress, and take their train spin around and they cross the floor.

3146
03:14:59,812 --> 03:15:03,737
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh,

3147
03:15:12,308 --> 03:15:17,093
[SPEAKER_14]: Sing the words, even though the bitch isn't singing.

3148
03:15:17,434 --> 03:15:20,897
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like this song.

3149
03:15:20,937 --> 03:15:22,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go, here we go.

3150
03:15:23,240 --> 03:15:24,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Walk like an Egyptian.

3151
03:15:25,182 --> 03:15:25,863
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

3152
03:15:27,765 --> 03:15:29,406
[SPEAKER_03]: This sucks.

3153
03:15:29,426 --> 03:15:30,487
[SPEAKER_03]: No kidding.

3154
03:15:33,070 --> 03:15:34,572
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the extended mix would have been better.

3155
03:15:41,656 --> 03:15:42,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Spin the disc, yo.

3156
03:15:43,178 --> 03:15:43,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

3157
03:15:47,162 --> 03:15:54,910
[SPEAKER_03]: You're breaking speakers across the internet.

3158
03:15:55,611 --> 03:16:01,257
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, I think now's a good time to put the gun in the perivial forehead of Orange Lounge Radio.

3159
03:16:02,188 --> 03:16:03,088
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, that's it.

3160
03:16:03,109 --> 03:16:03,689
[SPEAKER_14]: We're signing off.

3161
03:16:03,749 --> 03:16:04,489
[SPEAKER_14]: End of Afterbirth.

3162
03:16:04,549 --> 03:16:06,090
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to kick you now.

3163
03:16:06,170 --> 03:16:12,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Since it's six months into the year, June 1st, I think this is a good time to revive our non-stop New Years.

3164
03:16:13,254 --> 03:16:13,714
[SPEAKER_14]: So enjoy.

3165
03:16:13,734 --> 03:16:17,616
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to start it off with Zipmania Best and take you out throughout the evening.

3166
03:16:18,036 --> 03:16:19,677
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.

3167
03:16:19,717 --> 03:16:20,677

[SPEAKER_14]: Please whore up our listening hours.

3169
03:16:22,038 --> 03:16:22,798
[SPEAKER_14]: We desperately need it.

3170
03:16:22,838 --> 03:16:25,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Vote us a 5 and vote Legend of Max a 10.

3171
03:16:25,500 --> 03:16:26,060
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm Ben Weisdahl.

3172
03:16:26,240 --> 03:16:31,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter and vote for Legend of Trance.

3173
03:16:32,332 --> 03:16:32,633
[SPEAKER_05]: What did I say?

3174
03:16:32,653 --> 03:16:33,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of Max.

3175
03:16:33,935 --> 03:16:34,998
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my bad, Legend of Trance.

3176
03:16:36,621 --> 03:16:40,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, oh, oh, and someone needs to mix me the Sandbone Trio and Max 300.
