1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty talks and then some.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes, I will spank your child.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, here's my big opening.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
A sphincter says what?

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm super. Thanks for asking.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What am I doing here?

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Dodge this.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Mm-hmm. This is a tasty burger.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Look, you stupid bastard. You've got no arms left.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes, I have. Look.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Just a flesh wound.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Searching for a boy in high school is useless.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's searching for meaning in a polyshorn way.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, yeah? Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Dark Sakura.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Loki.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I hate you!

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, the fighting's already begun.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000

Shining like a jewel

60

Burning for love

61
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,760
In back of the light

62
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,760
The blood inside of

63

80
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,760
Orange Lounge Radio is proud to present a celebrity interview.

81
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
Can you introduce yourself for our listeners?

82
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,760
I'm Miss Cleo.

83
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
Oh, it's great to have you on the show today.

84
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
Hello, how are you today?

85
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,760
I'm great, thanks.

86
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,760
Did you have a question?

87
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
Well, yes, actually I wanted to know...

88
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,760
Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please?

89
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,760
Uh, well, no, I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.

90
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,760
Alright, go ahead.

91
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,360
Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?

92
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,760
Is he incarcerated?

93
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,760
Uh, actually, no he's not, but what do you think of the ever-ranty Dark Zakra?

94
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,360
Hi, dear, how are you?

95
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,560
I love you.

96
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,760
I see you two must know each other. Well, what do you think of Skye?

97
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,960
Did he used to play football when he was in high school?

98
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,560
Well, actually, no he didn't.

99
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,560
Ha ha ha ha!

100
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,760
Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?

101
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,560
I want you to really remember the pill, alright?

102
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,560
I'm seeing some forgetting possibly, and I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.

103
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,560
Right, okay, well thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.

104
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,560
Um, I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but...

105
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,560
Who are all of these nosy people, outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card?

106
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,560
Get away from me!

107
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
Ha ha ha!

108
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,560
Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.

109
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,920
I'm miss Cleo. I love you

110
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,040
Wait, sorry, we are muted. Hi, welcome back

111
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,320
You are assisting the orange lounge radio

112
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,540
episode number 46

113
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,940
I still have SARS. This is bad

114
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,920
This is very bad that I'm still sick after so much allergy

115
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:29,140
It's not sick. It's the allergies. No, it's not allergies. I swear. It's the sick of the air. I think I have a brain tumor

116
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,860
No, seriously like my head hurts like right up around here, it's not like a headache

117
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,820
I'll hit you somewhere else in your head and you won't hurt anyone. It's really filthy get away from me. Oh

118
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,460
My god you put the hat on Cartman. Yes, I did

119
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,460
Good.

120
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,460
God, you're a freak.

121
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,460
Anyway, oh yes, my brain tumor.

122
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,300
Oh, and about that tumor.

123
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,100
I seriously think, okay, I think the other night while I was sleeping or something I

124
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,900
must have like banged my head against the wall repeatedly because it feels like I have

125
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,900
a bruise.

126
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,900
Irene, look.

127
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,900
Do I have a bruise like right here?

128
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,900
It really hurts.

129
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,900
That's really good radio.

130
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,580
If it's not a tumor, then I swear it's like, I don't know.

131
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,060
By the way, you know what you didn't do last week even though I burned them for you?

132
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,060
What?

133
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,900
Those night style songs from the Tesla occasion.

134
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,900
Oh, you're right.

135
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,900
You know, we re-burned them.

136
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,900
Oh, you did. Well, I played some of them a few weeks ago, but, you know, we can play some-

137
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,900
Those are ones that you didn't have.

138
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,900
We'll do some Mind Style songs the next break.

139
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,900
Aha.

140
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,900
They're kinda crappy.

141
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,900
That's what the quality is, anyway.

142
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,900
I'd like to- Excuse me.

143
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,900
Okay, Kermit.

144
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,900
Hi, Ho.

145
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,900
What are you talking about, bitch?

146
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,900
Just kidding.

147
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:46,900
I like to apologize to Maren-chan right off the bat because I gave her SARS when she was here last week. I'm really sorry.

148
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,900
If she's listening?

149
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,900
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

150
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,900
You're talking more pain.

151
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Loki is talking about causing pain to the masses and things like that.

152
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,960
What else?

153
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
Oh, yeah, my brain tumor.

154
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,940
Now, it's really weird. Now, it's in my ear.

155
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,940
And my ear tumor?

156
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,900
Maybe I'm thinking I have an ear infection.

157
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,900
But then, sorry what was that?

158
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,900
Robbie, we need to go to Walmart and get you a new head.

159
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,900
I say I mean, Robbie's head.

160
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,900
Whoa, wait til Brad gets here, okay?

161
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:27,500
It kind of reminds me, you remember, and I can make this Balmani related, do you remember

162
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:36,080
in Max PC, or I'm sorry Max PC, do you remember Jason Enos' character?

163
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,880
like the head was really small than the rest of the body it made it look like it

164
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,180
looked like it reminded me of that scene from return to Oz where the witch like

165
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,780
had all the heads in a jar and like she could take into it because the head

166
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:53,900
looked faked it looked like it was just like screwed on yeah return to Oz was an

167
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,520
awesome movie good reference I liked it because it was like just like the book

168
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,740
you know what I think we need to do on orange hans radio some night see if this

169
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:08,520
is a rating success or a ratings disaster, because we have this neat new mixing board,

170
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,780
we can loop in the TV, so we should watch a movie and comment along with it. It'll be

171
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:18,780
like Mystery Science Theater on the radio. We need to watch Reading Rainbow. I am so

172
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:25,780
sad. You can't AP Reading Rainbow. I am sad. Why? About them not having any more money

173
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,380
to do more Reading Rainbow. They haven't cancelled Reading Rainbow yet. Yeah, but they can only

174
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,480
do what, four shows a year? I know, it's sad. This sucks. They better not cancel Reading

175
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,580
Rainbow. What will LeVar Burton do? Oh my god, LeVar Burton will like have to retire

176
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:45,240
because he's got. But he's a certified genius, he can get, they'll pay him for being smart.

177
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,960
You know what I saw on Game Show Network the other day? I saw The Weakest Link, Star Trek

178
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:55,020
edition. That was great. And he won. Well yeah, he's like an actual, isn't he, what's

179
00:14:55,020 --> 00:15:02,020
And not only did he win, he got like the highest jackpot in that game's history up to that

180
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,020
point or something like that. Isn't that fabulous?

181
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,020
This is really smart. I enjoy hearing about smart people because the world is mostly full

182
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:18,020
of idiots. Smart people bring a smile to my face. I'm just as much as seeing idiots die

183
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:23,020
smile to my face. I'm just as much as seeing idiots, you know, die violent, horrible, bloody

184
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,820
deaths. Do you have any fun idiot watching stories to tell this week? Have you been out

185
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,500
to the various arcades and seen any idiots? Just been driving on the road, plenty of idiots

186
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,280
there. And I was at the mall today, you know, good figure. Oh, how was the rest of your

187
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:41,680
day with Sharks Girl and Mel B, who were in town today? Well, you were there for Mango

188
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,700
Chow. Right, I was there for Mango Chow. And then we decided that we were going to go to

189
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,300
the idiot mecca of Sacramento, which is Ardent Fair Mall, and of course there's also the

190
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,220
idiot mecca of Roseville, which is in the Galleria.

191
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,780
What about Golfland?

192
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,300
That's just like the retard mecca.

193
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,020
There's a difference between idiots and retarded people.

194
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,380
Of course, calling that the retard mecca would probably insult retarded people everywhere.

195
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,380
Okay.

196
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,180
Anyway, there were lots of stupid people everywhere and they were all driving and they were in

197
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:12,320
the parking garage and we found like a really nice parking spot because it was in the second

198
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:19,060
level of the garage by Sears so it was all shady and this is still hot and the hot sucks

199
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,820
and then all the expresses everywhere are closed everywhere.

200
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,820
The stores?

201
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,820
Yeah.

202
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,820
Why?

203
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,820
Because they're remodeling or something.

204
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,820
That sucks.

205
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,820
She came all the way out here.

206
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,820
She started wasting her trip completely?

207
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,820
Well no, because she got something at Hot Topic.

208
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,820
She got a big, floppy, fuzzy black hat.

209
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,820
Whoa.

210
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,580
It's a hat.

211
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,580
Sounds kind of kinky.

212
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,580
It's a hat.

213
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,580
And we went to Torrid, I know it's not a kinky hat, it's a cute hat.

214
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:50,580
Then we went to Torrid, and I looked at clothes I can't buy yet because I haven't gotten paid.

215
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,580
And then we listened to Strong Bad on the way home.

216
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,580
Then we went to Scandia, ran into DJ Syndrome, and ran into...

217
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,580
We need to get him on the show some night.

218
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,580
We ran into Ryan, some name I guess.

219
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,580
We need to get him back on the show some night.

220
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,580
I know, because he's been falling off the face of the earth.

221
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,580
No kidding, and where's Intern Zero?

222
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,580
Intern Zero is probably working.

223
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,080
Oh, that's true.

224
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,580
Because remember, he works for my man now.

225
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,080
That's right.

226
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,080
He is now indirectly my bitch.

227
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,580
In all of these celebrity interviews that we'll be doing in future weeks,

228
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,580
you know, we'll always ask about Intern Zero

229
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,580
because we're always curious about, you know,

230
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,580
what the celebrities think of our intern.

231
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,580
Because we're very privileged to have Intern Zero on board here.

232
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,580
Well, it's, you know, we have a very privileged group

233
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,260
You know, we need to not forget about our foreign correspondent from the People's Republic

234
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,060
of Davis, Abed N'Hilpa'i, who entered here TM.

235
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,500
Yeah, we need to get Puppy back on the show too.

236
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,780
Puppy, get your ass back out here, now, or we spank you with a roll-up newspaper.

237
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,660
I'm waiting for the big sniff in the chat room.

238
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:02,660
Oh, if you want to join our chat room, head on over to www.calibomani.com, click on Orange

239
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:09,660
lounge and then click on chat. And then you can chat with our chatters in the chat room.

240
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,140
I feel really irresponsible because we're supposed to be working on the battle royale

241
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:21,140
plane instead of playing Ragnarok. Ha! I am so glad that it's gone pay to play.

242
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:27,100
I am seriously thinking of starting Ragnarok now because like I was watching Brad play

243
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,340
the other night it was comedy gold. Isn't it great?

244
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,320
tell your Ragnarok story first? Okay, they went pay to play, which is the best thing

245
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,500
that could have ever happened. I mean, true, I'm going to have friends who I used to, who

246
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,360
helped me level and get where I am today, character-wise, who are not going to pay to

247
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,720
play. But like, one friend gave me, um, like, 250,000 zenny, which was a lot of the money

248
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,480
in the game. So I went out and bought a bunch of armor. And now my character's badass. And

249
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,060
And on top of that, since they introduced the Pay to Play, like today's the actual day

250
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:08,500
it starts, the server congestion went from about 13,000 people logged in to 6,500, right

251
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
around there.

252
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
Therefore, there's no lag.

253
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,100
All of you people who decided to quit, thank you.

254
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,100
I love you.

255
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,100
Let's see, I'm thinking about starting to join now after watching Brad play the other

256
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,100
day.

257
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,100
That's fine.

258
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,860
Now, you and Brad play on different servers though, so can you move your character from

259
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,860
one server to another?

260
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,860
Nope.

261
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,860
You'll lose everything.

262
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,860
That's ass.

263
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,860
That is so ass.

264
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,860
But you can make two characters, one on each server.

265
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,860
That might work.

266
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,860
But you have to play on Chaos with me.

267
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,860
Okay, but if I do it, if, if, I still have to cancel my PSO account first because I don't

268
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,860
play PSO at all.

269
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,860
But mine was already cancelled, believe it or not.

270
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,860
Really?

271
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,860
I didn't even know mine was cancelled.

272
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:49,020
I looked up my stuff on, um, if you go to Sega.com slash PSO underscore GCN.

273
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,340
I wonder if they just cancel you automatically if you don't play.

274
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,420
Bless their little hearts if that's what they do.

275
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:59,100
They keep your information there in case you want to start back up, but I might start PSO

276
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:05,020
back up later, but for right now I've just been, that's been my, you know, I'll play

277
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,660
then I'll like let my character sit and heal while I go off and do other stuff.

278
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,620
Maren has given us the Ragnarok report.

279
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,260
There is currently 3,800 people logged into Chaos.

280
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,260
Thank you.

281
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:27,260
And see, I'm so glad that she's paying to play too, because then I get my sauce on Ragnorock with me, and I have 50 fire arrows for you.

282
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:41,260
Okay, for those that don't play Ragnorock online, you visit the website www.ragnarockonline.com

283
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,260
Excellent. Maybe somebody in the chat room will be so kind as to post a link.

284
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:50,260
And it's $12 a month unless you do pay by cash, then it's a little bit more because of the service charge.

285
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:56,260
But it's not continuously updating your pay, so you have to pay every month manually.

286
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:01,260
Even so, you can pay up to six months in advance.

287
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:08,260
I paid three. It's a little bit cheaper to pay three months or six months in advance, but I paid three months in advance.

288
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:13,260
And if you want to find me on there, my username is Sorato. It's the only one I have.

289
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:18,060
So what's the game like? It's kind of like the best way I can describe it is kind of like a multiplayer Secret of Mana.

290
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,820
Yeah, it's like playing Secret of Mana, you have your individual character.

291
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,980
You can form a party, you can share experience,

292
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:29,180
which is really good if you're all trying to get levels quickly because then

293
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,420
every time you fight something you'll all gain levels together.

294
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:39,180
You can buy stuff, upgrade your armor, you can make your own quest.

295
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,340
There's also bosses hidden in the game

296
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:47,340
Where you and a billion other people can just like tag team and like rape this guy.

297
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:53,340
Whoa! Tag team raping only on Ragnarok Online.

298
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,340
Like the Troll King or something.

299
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,340
In the chat room RiceRYC3 says,

300
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,340
It's like Diablo 2 but cuter.

301
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,340
I've been hearing it's not like Ultima. Ultima Online.

302
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,340
Oh, I never did play that.

303
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,340
It's all point and click killing stuff.

304
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,340
Let me tell my funny because I was watching, or actually it's really Brad's funny.

305
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:14,220
I was watching Brad play the other day, and I guess he was talking about this guy who

306
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,940
was, you know, because of the server changes, a lot of people, or the fact that they're

307
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,900
going pay-to-play, there was a lot of people giving shit away on there.

308
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,580
So there was this guy, and he stood there, he said, I'm gonna give away my armor, and

309
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,500
it's like this super rare armor, he says, I'm gonna give away my armor in ten minutes,

310
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,500
I'll be right back.

311
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,020
So he, you know, he says that, and then all these people just start crowding around him,

312
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,020
like tons and tons of people.

313
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,020
He's probably got lots of whispers.

314
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,980
Tons, I don't, I mean, just masses of people around him.

315
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,980
And then after 10 minutes of his up, he goes, just kidding, and runs away.

316
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:50,260
There was a guy in there, who kept dropping cards and then picking them up.

317
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,740
And then he's like, I'm going to drop all my cards, because cards are like, they're

318
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,900
a one in one million item or something that you can fit.

319
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,500
I think I've got like a bajillion of them.

320
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,820
Anyway, he says he's going to give away all of his cards, and so he drops one card, which

321
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,060
is like a pouring card which is like this little pink bubble thing which is the weakest

322
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,540
character in the game.

323
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:16,020
And then he starts dropping like twigs, branches, flowers, which are all like little crap stuff.

324
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,740
Awesome.

325
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,320
The other thing I watched Brad do, oh I actually suggest this because this is the crazy thing

326
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:26,580
about Ragnarok Online is that when you go into the towns, there's just masses of people

327
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,580
there.

328
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,100
Hi, we're AFK and clogging the server.

329
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,980
Oh my god, there's just people just standing there in the middle of the town.

330
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,620
It looks like China in there, I swear to God.

331
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,020
Hey, and you can get flu masks in the game.

332
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,220
You can buy yourself one from Ragnarok.

333
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,660
I swear to God, Ragnarok online looks like China.

334
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,420
So you go into the middle of the street or whatever, so I told Brad, hey, there's that

335
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,680
big clusterfuck of people standing in the middle of the screen.

336
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,700
Go run around him and go, I have SARS, cough, cough, cough.

337
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,700
So he did it.

338
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,540
He ran in, he ran in the middle of the group, and he's all, I have SARS, cough, cough, cough.

339
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:01,780
Literally the second after he did that, someone summoned a monster into town that just started

340
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:05,860
running around killing all the people that were idling. It was great. And Brad's like,

341
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,980
gotta go! This is great though because people have been protesting the charge, which is

342
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,460
I think so retarded, because they knew from the beginning that the whole reason that they

343
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:21,460
were beta-testing us is that you would eventually pay for the service. So this is great. And

344
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:26,460
for all you people who play, I don't know if they still have it up, but this is hilarious.

345
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:31,500
There's a warp, and the phone's ringing, there's a warp. We can't take phone calls on the show

346
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:37,500
On the south gate of Ponteira, which is like the middle town, and uh...

347
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
Oh, stop picking it up.

348
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,500
What?

349
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,500
It's spam.

350
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,500
Oh, it's spam?

351
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,500
Yeah.

352
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,500
Do not ruin this show to bring us spam!

353
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Hand, hand, hand, hey, hand, hey, hand, hey.

354
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,500
That could have been the most important call of my life, according to that.

355
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
Hand, come here.

356
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:12,820
They set up a warp right in the south gate of town, so if you leave town, you go into

357
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:18,460
this warp, and the warp shoots you to the Christmas village.

358
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,100
Everybody is trapped in a corral with no way out.

359
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,100
That's right.

360
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,500
So the only way you can get out is to use something called a fly wing, which will teleport

361
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
you to another part of town.

362
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:34,740
Luckily for me, I had a fly wing, so I go to the other part of town, and they're like,

363
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:40,180
let us out! Let us out! And I was like, ah! And then I got killed. And then I went back

364
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:45,300
there. And like, if you leave there, you have to dodge abominable snowmans and things, and

365
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,660
they're aggressive, so they chase you. But I have high agility, so I run away.

366
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,500
This is a fun topic. I want to solicit stories from the chat room. If anybody has any funny

367
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,100
online game stories, this is really nerdy, but it can be funny. If anybody has any really

368
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,340
good online game stories that are funny, send them to me in private message in the chatroom.

369
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,660
Well, this is the part that sucks. The only way out of the Christmas village,

370
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:09,020
besides warping, is going to the south, to warp past all the aggressive creatures.

371
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,300
It takes you to a city called Aldebaran, which is like way in the north.

372
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,340
The only way to get out of that town is to walk past three screens full of aggressive

373
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:16,860
creatures

374
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,580
that will kill me in two hits. And I made it out.

375
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,220
I was happy.

376
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,060
The wizards or whatever, weren't they the ones that were like, you have to pay me to get out of here

377
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,760
And I can work you out. Yeah, they have the ability to warping and some of them in the game

378
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,340
They're just like may I have the hill please not heal you

379
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,700
I'm like hey cool

380
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:41,540
and I ran into a swordman with sword sword ease are cool to hang out with because I like kill stuff for you if

381
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,680
You're low-level they like kill stuff

382
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,040
Then they'll let you tank on them which tanking means

383
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:51,220
they'll attack a creature once so that the creature keeps hitting them over and over and you can kill the creature and get the

384
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,140
experience from it and

385
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,420
so I

386
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,420
I hung out with one who killed a bunch of people for me and then they left.

387
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,420
Aww. Does Ragnarok still have really bad Engrish?

388
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:05,420
Yes, it's beautiful. It's like, it's core Engrish.

389
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,420
Cause remember it's Korean.

390
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,420
Okay, so I'm gonna shift gears and talk about a different online game that we brought up earlier, PSO.

391
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:19,420
I think I mentioned this on a previous show, but I'll tell you the funniest thing I've ever seen in PSO.

392
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,420
and PSO.

393
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,260
I don't know, were you there, Loki, when I was watching this?

394
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,780
I went into a server once, I went into a PSO server, and the way Phantasy Star Online looks,

395
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,820
it's kind of like a 3D Diablo II.

396
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,100
That's really the most elementary way of putting it.

397
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,820
You know, it probably doesn't do the game justice, but I'm just going to say it, it's

398
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,820
a 3D Diablo II.

399
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,820
So you go into the server room, which is like this giant circle, and you know, there are

400
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,740
all these people standing there, and then one guy decides to just start running laps

401
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,740
around the room.

402
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,940
He's just running around in a giant circle, and everybody, you actually can see like everybody

403
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:53,660
watching him as he's running around the circle on the screen and people are like going what

404
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,620
the hell and then suddenly a couple other guys decide to join him and they all start

405
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,420
running around in the circle and then suddenly like the entire server room is doing a big

406
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,180
conga line around the server.

407
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,460
It was the gayest thing ever but it was so funny.

408
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,540
I'm going to send some pictures for next week.

409
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:11,820
I have pictures because every so often I'll say the screen capture for when I'm playing

410
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,820
Ragnarok.

411
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:18,180
I have a picture of this place in the desert town where I was getting my weapons upgraded

412
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,900
and some friends met me there and then random people were there and we all formed a conga

413
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,020
line StableRx has an interesting story to share

414
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:30,780
here in our chat room. He says my friend Chris made a female account and as soon as he logged

415
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:35,060
in a guy started flirting with him. He kept stalking him until he logged out and he never

416
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:39,900
used the account again. Do you ever find yourself getting hit on as a female game player?

417
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:44,980
All the time but it's a good thing because they give me stuff.

418
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,020
I have a story.

419
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:52,660
We played, well this was back when Ultima Online was first getting started and we were

420
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:56,980
just being really stupid so what we did was we stripped our character of all of his clothes

421
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:02,340
and just said he got player killed and kept begging for stuff from people and the player's

422
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,540
name was Italian Sausage.

423
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:10,380
And so we were just running around yelling sausage for sale and just being like really

424
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,380
annoying.

425
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,380
Wait what game was this?

426
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,380
Ultima Online.

427
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,380
Oh ok Ultima Online.

428
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,380
We were really bored that day.

429
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,380
There's also a lot of idiots on Ragnarok.

430
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:26,380
Just randomly, I was in this one place that Ma and Chan showed me.

431
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,380
This island that you have to get to from Alberta.

432
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,380
Anyway, we were just sitting there.

433
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,380
Like, in the cave leading in, just waiting.

434
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,380
So I set up a chat room in there.

435
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,380
Said, told if 200 is any.

436
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,380
And people paid me.

437
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:46,900
I got like 600. That's awesome. And other people, this is a great idea, they set up

438
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,780
a kissing booth because there's an emoticon in the game that makes a smoochie and then

439
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:56,540
a little heart comes up and they're making money. So I want to do though, one of my friends

440
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:01,100
did, I forgot who this was. It was so long ago. One of the people I was playing with

441
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:07,920
back on when I first was playing the second beta, um, decided, they wrote on this, um,

442
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:14,300
like, sex or 500 zenny or something, or 5000, and so, the person went in there and paid

443
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,180
up front, just like how you got fucked.

444
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:26,180
That's great. Um, so, okay, we can bring this around to Bomani somehow, believe it or not,

445
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:31,380
Because with the new DDR going to go online, that's going to be very interesting.

446
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:43,980
I mean, do you think there's going to be more to it than just the, oh, find a person to

447
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:48,740
dance with and watch them watch your other side of the screen get perfect scrapes boost?

448
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,300
Or do you think there might be this whole like developing your own dancer type thing?

449
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,940
I think it should be like dance magic and then with like conquest mode.

450
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,860
If there was a god there would be dance magic mode.

451
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,300
Wouldn't it be cool to have dance magic and then like be able to have your character just

452
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:08,580
on the server randomly and you can have stats up there like in conquest mode from Soul Calibur.

453
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,580
Wouldn't that be cool?

454
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,580
Dance conquest!

455
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,860
That would be cool!

456
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,860
I'd play.

457
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:17,300
This is why we should work for Konami.

458
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,300
I'm sorry, Jamie?

459
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,700
This is why we should work for Konami.

460
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,700
I agree.

461
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:49,700
1. More funny online gaming stories 2. This one time I was playing Counter Strike and the server had friendly fire on. I just entered the server and killed this guy for his gun. He got pissed and I left the server.

462
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,700
Meanie

463
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,940
Yeah, you can ask interested

464
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:01,180
Did you do our angel has a story to share dad and I were playing Diablo 2 on our own server

465
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,420
we came to upper cressat and

466
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,200
Go after the council members one by one

467
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,160
I start running around just to get the little monsters to get experience next thing

468
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:16,140
You know somehow I end up having all seven council members chasing me. I scream help dad goes. How did you do that?

469
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:21,540
I go I don't know dad proceeds to kill all their asses in less than five minutes while I lay there dead

470
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:32,580
That's so interesting because um, I've never heard of anybody playing online games with their parents that would scare me to run into my mother

471
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,660
Well, he's just cool like that and you know that any of us when we have kids

472
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,280
We're gonna play games with our kids too

473
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:48,260
but I just as it is now I could never imagine like my mother or my dad no my

474
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,220
dad's actually computer savvy and there are some computer games he's played in

475
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,700
the past mostly solitaire and shit like card games but if I were to run into him

476
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:00,380
on an online game I'd like zap him so he couldn't like he couldn't embarrass me

477
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:08,240
I'd kill him you know my party is named huh my party is named Battle Royale of

478
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,360
Of course.

479
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,600
I want to make a guild called Battle Royale.

480
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,760
Or BR Act.

481
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,120
The BR Act.

482
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,560
I like, I really like that idea of DDR Online having a dancing conquest.

483
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,040
That would be cool. What other cool DDR Online ideas

484
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,560
have people thought of?

485
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,440
How about this?

486
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,720
How about they don't make it?

487
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,800
Ooh, there's an idea.

488
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,720
You're here.

489
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,080
Shut up, bitch.

490
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,500
That has nothing to do with the topic, Dan.

491
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:47,580
I think they should make Stroker online, because that's how many people we're paying off.

492
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:51,540
Nobody gets that, Loki. Nobody. I don't care.

493
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,580
You know the game they need to make another one of?

494
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,760
Freaking Night Trap.

495
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,060
Night Trap 2. That would be the shit.

496
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:02,520
Did you hear that, um, oh wait, Night Trap wasn't on 3DO. It was a Sega CD game, wasn't it?

497
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,060
I owned the damn game.

498
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,940
3DO filed for bankruptcy this week.

499
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,440
Yay!

500
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,940
And whenever I think of, you know, whenever I think of 3DO though, I think of that horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE Zelda game.

501
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,940
That was a CD-i.

502
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,940
Wasn't that 3DO?

503
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,940
No, it was CD-i.

504
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,940
Nevermind.

505
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,940
3DO I'll always remember as the first time playing You Don't Know Jack.

506
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,940
What the fuck did 3DO do then?

507
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,940
They made the stupid army man games.

508
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,940
Wasn't there a system called 3DO?

509
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,540
There was a 3DO, but I don't think it was the same people.

510
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,740
What the fuck was on the 3DO system?

511
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,740
Flashback.

512
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,740
That's it?

513
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,740
That was their biggest game, was Flashback?

514
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:47,820
They had this like, it was supposedly this, you know, what was it called, this something

515
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,820
M technology?

516
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,820
They had uh, Road Rage.

517
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,340
Okay, here we go.

518
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,260
Road Rage, Eternal Champions, thank you, Tarun.

519
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,380
Eternal Champions was not on the freaking 3DO.

520
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,380
Are you sure?

521
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,180
I'm more than positive Kabuki Clash was on the 3DO.

522
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:08,180
I just remembered those things for like 400 bucks. Fuck that.

523
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:12,180
Eternal Champions was on the Genesis and the Eternal Champions CD was on the Sega CD.

524
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:18,180
I own the game and I should know. I even bought, um, what was the thing called? The Menacer? Was that what it was called?

525
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,180
Yeah.

526
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,180
The Activator.

527
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,180
Well, the Menacer was the gun.

528
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:26,180
Right, I have got a Menacer. But I've got an Activator too, the one that's like the arena.

529
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,180
I bought it at Virgin, like a year ago.

530
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:32,180
Yeah, and it came with Eternal Champions.

531
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,180
It's sitting in my closet.

532
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:42,180
You know what? I kinda want a CD-i system and a 3DO just because, you know, nobody has them.

533
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,180
You know what shitty system I want?

534
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,180
What?

535
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,180
A Jaguar CD.

536
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,180
I want a Jaguar CD.

537
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,180
So I can play Defender 2000.

538
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,180
I want Tempest 2000.

539
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,180
Okay, you can get it on Saturn then.

540
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,180
Okay, but I want the Jaguar version.

541
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,180
Same name name.

542
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:01,180
But it's Atari's system, and it's Atari games, so...

543
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,180
And it's easier to control on the...

544
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,180
Shush!

545
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,180
That's it.

546
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,180
Saturn, right?

547
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,180
Do I have a Saturn?

548
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,180
Loki has a Saturn.

549
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,180
Loki has a Saturn.

550
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,180
I'll bring you over to Tempest 2000 next week.

551
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,180
Oh dear lord.

552
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,180
That's it, pre-show next week should be all Tempest 2000 songs.

553
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,180
I'm down with that.

554
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,180
Actually, I want to do...

555
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,180
Jamie, you have to let me do one pre-show one week, because...

556
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,180
No.

557
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,180
I want to do...

558
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,180
I want to do Commodore 64 music.

559
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,180
Oh my god, yes!

560
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:35,180
Did you hear what Bradley posted in response to your Commodore 64?

561
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:40,180
Hold on, let me bring it up. Okay, for those of you that listen to Orange Laundry like all the time, that would be the cool people.

562
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:47,180
On Friday night, you would have heard me doing a fuck off show because I was really bored and Irene flaked on me for going out Friday night.

563
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:52,180
So I played a bunch of 80's music and that led into talk about Commodore 64.

564
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,520
because the Commodore 64 was like the coolest computer system ever

565
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,560
and it just turned twenty years old like two months ago but anyway

566
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,040
so um...

567
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,340
I had a point to this

568
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,740
oh yeah I started downloading all these games and stuff

569
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,080
and um... one of them

570
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,520
one of the most memorable games for me on Commodore 64 was Impossible Mission

571
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,980
tell us a little bit about Impossible Mission, Irene

572
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,480
uh... it was really cheesy, it had really bad voice acting

573
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,980
you basically had to try to put them together as well

574
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:25,340
paper that had little, you know, googly marks and stuff. But anyway, it had really bad,

575
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:30,820
like, pseudo-voice acting, and, um, Rob was gonna be pulling up, like, you know, a special

576
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,420
treat or whatever, but yeah. It was really hard, like, you had to time it, and if you

577
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:39,020
didn't beat it by then, then you, like, died for some reason. I don't really remember.

578
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:45,660
Yeah, but it was a great game. Hey, Rob. You know what I wanna bring over? What? My Coleco

579
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:50,740
vision. What do you have on Coleco vision? Oh, you have the Casey Munchkin on. That was

580
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:55,900
the Odyssey. My bad. You don't even have a TV that my Odyssey will work with. You need

581
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:02,780
one of those old ones with like the prong hookup thingies. Ok hold on I'm going to download

582
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,780
that sound clip we were talking about earlier. Oh my god. If I can get it. But we need to

583
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:15,220
play Smurf. Or I can bring over the 2600 and we can play the worst game ever. What? E.T.

584
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:20,640
I saw. Or Pac-Man. I saw this hilarious commercial on G4 today. There was this guy and I guess

585
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,560
he was a programmer or whatever and he says hey I'm so-and-so and I programmed

586
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,840
Yars revenge and I programmed um he's I programmed Yars revenge and I programmed

587
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,120
what was the other thing he'd done and then he goes he said I programmed Yars

588
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:39,120
revenge I programmed Raiders of the Lost Ark and I programmed ET. He's like so I'm

589
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:44,320
known for one of the best 2600 games of all time and one of the worst. Anyway oh

590
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,240
here's that sound file we were talking about earlier kids.

591
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:29,240
I've actually got promo for the prototype. They did, and they put these out I think at one of the classic gaming conventions which I want to go to in Vegas.

592
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:34,240
But they, I think it's Classic Gaming Expo is the one that's in Vegas over here.

593
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,240
Oh, I hella want to go to that. When is that?

594
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,240
I think it's in August is when it's coming up.

595
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,240
I hope it's not the same weekend as Cyberbeat Nation 2.

596
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,240
I don't know.

597
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:49,400
But, um, well, anyway, they have prototype games. They've actually

598
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,200
cartridge-ized and everything. And this guy sold them on eBay. And we picked up

599
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,240
Super Pac-Man, which is my favorite Pac-Man game.

600
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,320
Yes, I agree. Super Pac-Man is the best Pac-Man game.

601
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,720
And we picked up Millipede for this. And I've got a trackball.

602
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,200
Ah, cool.

603
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,280
Nothing beats playing Millipede on a 5200 with a trackball.

604
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:15,280
There are very few experiences that are as beautiful as that.

605
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,280
I have a quick Bamani related question when it comes to Atari 2600.

606
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,280
Wasn't somebody trying to develop Dance Dance Revolution for the 2600?

607
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,280
Yes.

608
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,280
Whatever happened with that?

609
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,280
Loki, you probably follow that subject better than any of us.

610
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,280
No, it's because people still program for the 2600 for I don't know whatever reason,

611
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,280
because it's fun.

612
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,280
They were trying to create like a sort of Dance Dance Revolution type game, and the

613
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:47,280
The problem is they had to do it like horizontally instead of vertically because I guess the vertical refresh rate isn't as fast as the horizontal refresh rate or something like that.

614
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,280
It's like playing Beatmania on the WonderSwan.

615
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
Yeah, you were saying?

616
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,280
Anyway, so yeah, I don't think that it would ever win anywhere.

617
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:08,280
You know what I want to get? They have for your cell phones, or for certain cell phones, you know how you can put games on there? Yeah, pump it up.

618
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,280
Yeah, I heard about that, but I couldn't find where you'd download it.

619
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,280
I think it's only for Korean cell phones.

620
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,280
There's pictures in one of the DDR live journal things.

621
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,280
I'm too lazy to go look them up.

622
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,280
Just because they're garlicky.

623
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,280
I think we need to take a break. Let's take a quick break. We're going to do a break, and this is...

624
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,340
memory of cheese attached to them. We're gonna play some 9th Style songs this break. So the

625
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:38,340
quality of the MP3s is kinda eh, but you guys might enjoy these anyways. So it's a free

626
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:44,980
preview here of what's coming up on 9th Style. We're gonna play the following songs. Emotion

627
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:51,260
2003, Romantic Extra, Abyss, Let's Say Hello, and Distress. So we're gonna hear all those

628
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,320
fabulous night style songs and then we'll be back

629
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,860
sound like a plan

630
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:59,980
you are listening to orange lounge radio

631
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,900
if you want to join in the fun in the chat room when they're all reminiscing about

632
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,300
classic video games right now i'm seeing all these great games being named right now

633
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,460
adventure

634
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,740
beachhead

635
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,780
mule

636
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:14,440
mule uh... or I should say M-U-L-E

637
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,260
combat

638
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,940
So we will be right back after some night style mp3s

639
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,360
So the quality of these is kind of am but it'll give you an impression of what you can look forward to very soon

640
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,360
We'll be back.

641
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:59,360
The

642
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,360
The

643
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:07,360
The

644
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:11,360
The

645
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:15,360
The

646
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,360
The

647
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:23,360
The

648
00:49:53,360 --> 00:50:16,080
It's more contagious than SARS It's Orange Lounge Radio

649
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,080
Howdy!

650
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,080
We're back!

651
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,080
How are you?

652
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,080
SARS horrific!

653
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,760
I hope you enjoyed those 9 style preview songs.

654
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:26,760
I know the quality was a little poopy, but you know, they always are at first.

655
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,760
I'm surprised we haven't had better ones by this point yet, though.

656
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,760
I'm so happy about the second to last song.

657
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,760
The Let's Say Hello?

658
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,760
Uh-huh.

659
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,760
That song's cute.

660
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,760
That one was cool.

661
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:37,760
It sounds worthy of, like, pop and music-ness.

662
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,760
It makes me think of Murmur Twins.

663
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,760
You think it's the same group?

664
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,760
I don't think it is.

665
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,760
No, it just makes me think of Murmur Twins.

666
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,760
Hmm.

667
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,760
I don't know who did that, and I'm too lazy to look it up right now.

668
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,760
So, we're back. Hello, how are you?

669
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,760
I'm trying to think.

670
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,760
I'm hazelnutty. And garlicky.

671
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,760
I noticed Loki's working on some things over there. You want to do the cage match?

672
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,760
Sure. Did I bring a song? You did bring a song.

673
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,760
Okay, I forgot if I did. Yes you did. Okay, we're going to do the cage match.

674
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,760
Because we usually don't do the cage match early in the show, we're just going to throw people through the loop.

675
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:23,440
you can win that's has he has he been four weeks yes oh yes this will be the

676
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,680
fourth week cuz Mona Lisa Overdrive had two weeks the first time because of b3

677
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:34,360
yes oh we've got more people here hello it's men hello boys and girls it's man

678
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:41,640

679
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,540
the topic we were talking about before you guys got here I know Matt maybe has

680
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:49,180
something to contribute because he used to play ever crack we were just talking

681
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:53,700
about funny no funny online gaming stories and I already told the one about

682
00:51:53,700 --> 00:52:01,420
you telling people in Ragnarok yet stars yes Oh video which Jamie just asked me

683
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:05,340
if I'm paying to play they just okay we just felt like a half hour talking about

684
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,740
Ragnarok so make it quick quick all right for those if there's anybody who's

685
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:12,380
interested or is playing they did today shut off the servers to get ready for

686
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:19,380
It did just come back up, and instead of being 12,000 people on the server with lots of lag, there's 2,400 people on the server with no lag.

687
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:24,380
We had an update from Aaron who says 3,800 people are logged into Chaos right now.

688
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:26,380
Loki is a little less people.

689
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:29,380
Damn, there's less people on you, Loki.

690
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:32,380
I have lots of people on me.

691
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,380
Yeah, it's just weird.

692
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:41,380
Do you have any quick, fun, stupid online gaming stories you want to share? Like things that happen to you in an online game?

693
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:47,380
Yeah, okay, here's another. Do you mind if I talk about Ragnarok? Sure. If it's funny, it has to be funny.

694
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:48,380
It is pretty funny.

695
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:50,380
Wait, is it about the guy in the armor? Because I told that one too.

696
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,380
The guy in the armor?

697
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:56,380
Never mind. The guy who was going to give away the armor said just kidding and ran off.

698
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:59,380
Oh, no. That was funny though.

699
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:04,380
One of the classes has the ability to warp people places.

700
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:11,380
Well, when people got wins that they were going to be going pay to play, like 50 or more percent of the people who play the beta didn't like that.

701
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:15,380
So they started warping people to places where they can't get out of it.

702
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:18,380
And they did that to me, the Christmas village.

703
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:21,380
I had a fly wing too, but it took me 10 minutes to realize I had one.

704
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:27,380
And so they were sitting there and I took screen captures and I was like, I'm going to report you guys to gravity and you're going to get kicked off the server.

705
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:33,620
15 minutes ago called your topic arrived. I'm just kidding. You know what? I just got here. I'm just kidding

706
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,260
I am go good not this

707
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,540
Matt do you have any ever cracked stories that are funny?

708
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:44,900
No one more little thing. Okay. I freaking got warped to five different locations in a row

709
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,540
And then sent me to glass time

710
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,700
I hate glass time

711
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,020
Eat electric death

712
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:57,020
Yes, greatest video game quote ever.

713
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:29,340
lounge radio so let's start it off with the reigning champion Loki's pick three

714
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:34,300
weeks actually only two shows victorious but since we had no show the weekend of

715
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:39,140
b3 it's been victorious for three weeks now so this is the last time it can win

716
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:46,500
and this will be the very first four week rotated song if this one so here's

717
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,300
Here's a clip of Loki's song.

718
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,300
You want to introduce us?

719
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:58,740
This is Don Davis and Juno Reactor with Mona Lisa Overdrive from the Matrix Reloaded movie.

720
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:04,100
And since it is last week's winner, you only get to hear a clip, sorry kids.

721
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:11,100
So here's a clip of Mona Lisa overdrive.

722
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:44,060
Then there's a clip of last week's winner, Mona Lisa Overdrive.

723
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,060
Beautiful.

724
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,860
Alright, the next entry tonight comes from...

725
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:48,860
Jamie!

726
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,500
That's going to annoy the hell out of Matt.

727
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,500
Okay, so tell us...

728
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,500
It's something Speedmix.

729
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,500
Uh oh.

730
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,500
Oh God, it's a Speedmix.

731
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,500
Well, tell us about it.

732
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,500
It's September.

733
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,500
It's old school stuff.

734
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,500
It's old school.

735
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,500
Who's it by?

736
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,500
I don't remember.

737
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,500
DJ Speedo with September the Speedo mix.

738
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:09,140
I think I got this one from JB, but I like the song anyway because I like the original.

739
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:10,140
Alright, sounds good.

740
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:13,560
So this is Jamie's pick for this week, and since it's a new entry, you get to hear the

741
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,320
whole five minute long version.

742
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,320
Here it is.

743
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:20,540
DJ Speedo with September, the Speedo mix, Jamie's pick for the cage match this week.

744
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:22,540
Enjoy

745
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:23,540
You're the king of the world, we're singing

746
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:26,540
There's a dance of the night in the mud

747
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:29,540
How the stars roll the night away

748
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:03,540
Are you flying? Are you flying away?

749
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:25,540
My thoughts are with you, holding hands with your arms I see you, over the wall below Remember how when you look at me, I'll be there with you

750
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:35,540
My thoughts are with you, holding hands with your arms I see you, always look on in love Remember, how a new love was here this day

751
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:46,540
Now December is on the line, we'll share in September Only blue for time alone, remember True love is shared today

752
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:26,540
Now I'm with you, holding hands with your arms I see you, a little bit hard to love Remember how a new love was here today

753
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:37,540
Now the summer, summer love, yeah, the summer Only a little time to love, remember True love is here today

754
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:53,380
I was about to leave the house, and I couldn't find a song, so I picked September, because

755
01:02:53,380 --> 01:03:00,160
I like the song, I like the original, I like the speed mix okay, I give it an upper level

756
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,660
eight, barely a nine.

757
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:03,620
Upper level eight, barely a nine from Jamie.

758
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:09,120
Okay, I give it a 2 because it's a speedmix and I hate speedmixes and everything.

759
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,620
What did I say?

760
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,620
I hate speedmixes.

761
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:15,620
God dammit, it's not a new song, you just sped up the old one.

762
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:18,620
Stop it.

763
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:24,620
I would give that song like, I don't know, okay, this is my problem with speedmixes.

764
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:27,620
DDR size, like a minute and a half, two minutes, they're awesome.

765
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:30,620
They're cool, they're fun, they're cheesy to dance to, they're great.

766
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:33,620
Five minutes long? Joke's old.

767
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:36,620
So, if that were two minutes long, I'd give it like an eight.

768
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:39,620
But since it's five minutes long, I'm gonna have it and give it a four.

769
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,620
But I do, I like the original too.

770
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,620
Yeah, the original was good.

771
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:50,620
I love the original. I love the original, but... no.

772
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,620
It's just a... no.

773
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:56,620
Alright. Matt, the ice prince, or ice queen, whatever we're calling you.

774
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:57,620
Whatever.

775
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:59,620
We have the rice princess and the ice princess.

776
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:04,620
I like that better than Ice Queen. I'm not that dramatic, bitch.

777
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:09,620
Anyway, I have to give that about a six. Rob made a good point.

778
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:14,620
Five minutes is a little too long for a speed mix. It just gets repetitive, so...

779
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:19,620
Well, it depends on how you're... Well, never mind. Anyway, I give it a six.

780
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:27,620
The problem is it goes so fast that really you're listening to about 15 minutes worth of music in that little five minute spot.

781
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:32,620
Loki makes a damn good point. Listen up everybody. Irene, you have something to say?

782
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:40,620
Yeah, I agree. I give it a 6 too, because I'm really burnt out on speed mixes, especially all the crap that you play on Orange Lounge.

783
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:45,620
Yeah, that you need to take off. But yeah, 6, yeah, whatever.

784
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:56,620
Mr. Brad, there are only three good speed songs in this world. Can't Stop Falling in Love, If You Were Here With Me Before the Beat, and the Aerosmith Jaded song.

785
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:59,620
If it's not that, it's not good. If it's two.

786
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:01,620
No, it's a one.

787
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:05,620
What?

788
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:09,620
Yeah, there was a speed mix that won the cage match one time.

789
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:11,620
Yeah, I was heaven is a place on earth.

790
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:17,620
So, I think the general public would tend to disagree with you, Mr. Brad.

791
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:21,620
The general public doesn't matter.

792
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:25,620
Because they're all retards and they don't play Ragnarok online.

793
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:27,620
Jamie knows what I'm talking about

794
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,680
Anyway, can we get onto my pic now?

795
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,680
No, they don't need to play rock n' roll

796
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,680
My pick, my pick, my pick time

797
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,680
There's never gonna be any more clocks

798
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,680
My pick time, it's my pick time

799
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,680
Fine, go! God

800
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,680
Okay, who remembers like about three months ago

801
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,680
when I put in a song by Kylie Minogue called

802
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:44,680
Your Disco Needs You

803
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,680
And everybody wanted to kill me

804
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:49,680
Well, this is a Kylie song that people said

805
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,680
I should have put in instead

806
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,680
And this is, I'll admit it

807
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,780
much better Kylie song and if any Kylie song would win the cage match should be

808
01:05:56,780 --> 01:06:00,660
this one and it's very cute it's very depth will to be great of a Monty game

809
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:05,260
and it's got a great video it's got a wonderful video to it it but you can't

810
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:09,100

830
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:03,280

01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:08,280
I need your love

High up on your head

833
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:25,280
I need your love

834
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:35,280
I need your love

835
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:43,280
Like I need more than you

836
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:49,280
Come, come, come into my world

837
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:54,280
Would you feel me? Oh, oh

838
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:58,280
I am on your love, baby

839
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:04,280
Come, come, come into my world

840
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:07,280
But you're giving me up

841
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:14,280
Higher from your, higher from your love

842
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:54,320
Alright, boys and girls, Kylie Minogue with Come Into My World, what did y'all think of

843
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,320
that one?

844
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:58,360
Jamie's in the facilities right now, so we'll start with Irene.

845
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:04,640
Oh, I like Kylie, um, that was a pretty good one, I give it an 8, I'd rather hear In Your

846
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,760
Eyes, but that one's pretty good.

847
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,760
Maybe another time, in another three months I'll do it, you're right.

848
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:09,760
Yeah.

849
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:10,760
Yeah.

850
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:11,760
Alright.

851
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:12,760
What do you give it honest?

852
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:13,760
One to ten?

853
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:14,760
Eight?

854
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:15,760
You give it an eight?

855
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:16,760
An eight, yeah.

856
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:17,760
Alright.

857
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:18,760
Uh.

858
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:19,760
Whoever grabs the mic next?

859
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:20,760
Eight.

860
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:21,760
Jamie.

861
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:22,760
Eight.

862
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:23,760
Brad.

863
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,760
Um.

864
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:30,760
I give it an eight too, because I like this one a lot, but.

865
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:32,760
Not a huge Kylie fan.

866
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:33,760
I know.

867
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:34,760
Fine.

868
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:40,180
Kill me kick me out of here be gone. Just beat me up now, please ice ween

869
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,600
What I sweat well, no that was only last night oh

870
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,480
Boy anyway

871
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,520
Anyway, if that was anything like the other song that you were playing

872
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:57,600
I was gonna have to tell somebody to go get a rope so we can hang you by your friggin toes from the ceiling

873
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,840
But no, that was a good one. I like that song a lot. I give that a nine

874
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,840
Okay, excellent.

875
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:04,840
Loki!

876
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:09,840
Wow, you know, that sounded like every other fucking song that she sings.

877
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:19,840
Gee, um, hmm, since I've heard it before, you know, I'm gonna have to say that, uh, I'm gonna give it a zero because it sucks ass.

878
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:26,840
And, no, actually, no, Kylie's alright, but that song sucks. Seriously, she has done much better stuff in that song.

879
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:35,840
I actually have to decrease mine because last weekend when Marron and I had lunch in San Francisco, they played nothing but Kylie Minogue.

880
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:40,840
And then I was there the weekend before, so all of you were at the tourney and I went to go get lunch.

881
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:46,840
And it was when Megumi-chan and I were having lunch and they were playing Kylie. So I dropped mine to a six.

882
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:57,840
Just out of bitterness. I would just like to, I would like to retort Loki's argument and say that that song sounds nothing like I should be so lucky in love.

883
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:04,840
I should be so lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.

884
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,840
Come on!

885
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:10,840
Anyway, I give it a ten, it's fabulous.

886
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:16,840
Alright, here we go. You can send your votes now. Here's a quick recap of the songs in tonight's Cade Match.

887
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:22,840
Pick number one, last week's winner, three weeks winner, Mona Lisa Overdrive and The Matrix 2.

888
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,840
That's a shitty clip of the song. Let me play a different clip.

889
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:49,360
All right, pick number two, DJ Speedo with Sick Timber.

890
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:59,040

900
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:56,540
All right. Ooh, my screen is filling up with votes for the cage match. I'm going to have to go count those in a little bit.

901
01:14:56,540 --> 01:15:00,600
In the meantime, what else do you kids want to talk about today?

902
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,300
Do we have a sim update with Loki?

903
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:03,660
Loki's been awfully quiet.

904
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:04,600
I think Kylie scared him.

905
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,400
So, let's wake him up with a sim update.

906
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,740
You know, I want to know where my freaking Dancy Stage Party Edition stuff went.

907
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,200
It's like disappeared off my computer.

908
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:12,800
That's weird.

909
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:18,920
Anyways, there's a new CVS update for StepMania.

910
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,440
It was just updated yesterday, I believe.

911
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:22,820
Pretty nice.

912
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:24,020
I was playing with that earlier.

913
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:29,620
They've got a bunch of new modifiers added in there, which is pretty cool, and then they've also done some other things.

914
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:32,620
They added a few things where you can adjust the pitch of the song.

915
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:40,020
Before it used to be limited just to 0.7, now you can go all the way down to 0.3, which makes the song sound really bad.

916
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:46,020
But, you know, if you really wanted to practice or something, that's pretty good for you, and it loads really nice, so go check that one out.

917
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:52,020
And if you haven't checked out, there's a new DWI version, 2.49 or whatever, but I don't play DWI because it's inferior,

918
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:55,100
So, you know, go check that one out too.

919
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:58,760
Now, as for other updates, let's see here.

920
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:03,740
Check for my sims because that Uber or Utterdude or whatever,

921
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:07,660
that guy is releasing a lot of cool stuff and pretty much all the step files kick ass

922
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:09,660
and they're just really playable, so go play those.

923
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:16,480
And other than that, I have the second most DWIs on the internet other than Shoei,

924
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:20,320
which has, you know, 5,000 by 3,000 something now, so yay.

925
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:30,320
I would have 5000 if I put every single one that he has in there because I have all those files but unfortunately he has duplicates so I don't put them all in there.

926
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:33,320
Anyways, so back to you.

927
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,320
Wonderful.

928
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:38,320
Wasn't there a new StepMania on stuff?

929
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,320
Weren't you even listening to what I was-

930
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:44,320
No I wasn't. Um, they weren't either. They were over there in the corner talking about their-

931
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,320
I was tallying cage match votes, I'm sorry.

932
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,320
Hello, Joe.

933
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,320
We're talking about money, go away.

934
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:53,320
What about money?

935
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:55,320
We're talking about the fact that you don't have it.

936
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,320
Yeah.

937
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:59,320
Sniff.

938
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,320
Hello, we're trying to do a show here, what's up?

939
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,320
If you're gonna stand on the show, what's up?

940
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:05,320
What?

941
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,320
Shut up.

942
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,320
Bitch, please.

943
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:11,320
Your hair is sticking up.

944
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:13,320
Okay, Irene, what would you like for McDonald's?

945
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:17,320
I'd like a chicken sandwich and some fries.

946
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:20,820
Okay, so maybe I'll just get the meal. It's the fries and the drink and stuff.

947
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:21,960
I'll take your car, right?

948
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:24,040
Whatever's cheaper. Yeah, you can take my car.

949
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:27,040
Okay, I gotta go get cash back. Can you get me one of those cheesecake McFlurries while you're out?

950
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:32,320
Hey, fuck you! See, this is why I need things on the radio, because I need food for McDonald's, too.

951
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:38,960
Our listeners really want to hear about the Uber ride. I think they do. No.

952
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:42,880
Listeners, you care about what we're getting at McDonald's. I say we have a vote.

953
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,600
What do you think we should get at McDonald's?

954
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,200
No, don't get them mixed up with the Cajun Metro.

955
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:51,440
I want one if they have the, for a limited time only, they have the Strawberry

956
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:52,360
Cheesecake McFlurries.

957
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:53,800
For a limited time.

958
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,040
For a limited time only.

959
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,960
That's okay, cause I'm just going to go eat sandwich at my house after the show.

960
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,360
You're going to go eat a sandwich?

961
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:01,680
Fine.

962
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,120
I don't eat.

963
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:04,760
Okay.

964
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,920
Um, so you're going to give me that McFlurry if I give you money?

965
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,320
The strawberry cheesecake one?

966
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:16,320
If they don't have the strawberry cheesecake one, you can get me an Oreo one.

967
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,320
Teehee.

968
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:18,320
Boom shakalaka.

969
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,320
Thank you, Bradley.

970
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,320
You're my friend.

971
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,320
Yes, thank you.

972
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:22,320
Okay, hi.

973
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,320
See?

974
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:24,320
We already got a vote.

975
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:36,320
We got a vote for double quarter pounder with cheese meal.

976
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,320
That's a royal with cheese.

977
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,320
Is everybody leaving?

978
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,320
Hi.

979
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,320
Oh.

980
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:45,320
What are you getting frustrated about?

981
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:50,320
I'm missing step files and my programs just disappeared out of my taskbar.

982
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:55,320
Dammit!

983
01:18:55,320 --> 01:19:00,320
Irene, are you guys going to do Orange Crush tonight?

984
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:05,320
Okay, that's something to look forward to in the next hour or so.

985
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,320
You want to do a list list tonight?

986
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:08,320
We haven't done one in forever.

987
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,320
We haven't done one in forever.

988
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:13,320
Let's do a list list when we get back, since there will only be four of us here, right?

989
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,320
I'm taking a nap.

990
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:17,320
What list list topic?

991
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:18,320
I'll think of one.

992
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,320
I will solicit ideas from the chat room.

993
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,320
We have no idea what to do on list list tonight.

994
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:25,320
Top of cool anime in the world.

995
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:27,320
I'd have to research that.

996
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:28,320
Top of cool anime.

997
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,320
Haven't we done best anime before?

998
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,320
No, we never have.

999
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:35,320
How about Worst Bemani Game?

1000
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,320
There's probably not enough.

1001
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,320
We could do Worst Video Game.

1002
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,320
Did we do Worst Video Game?

1003
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,320
Yes.

1004
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:48,320
Let's see.

1005
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:52,320
No, but I'm not getting suggestions for a listless segment.

1006
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,320
Well anticipated video game from E3, like it didn't.

1007
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,320
No.

1008
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:04,120
G4 can kiss my balls, because I was watching this show on there, but Rob, you might get

1009
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:05,120
SARS.

1010
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,120
I know, I might.

1011
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,120
I was watching this show on there today.

1012
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:10,600
What was that, the 10 play or something like that?

1013
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,600
Which one?

1014
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,600
The 10 play.

1015
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:13,600
What was that show?

1016
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,600
The 10 spot?

1017
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:15,600
10 play?

1018
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,600
Yeah, 10 play.

1019
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:21,520
I think that's what it was called or something like that, where it's a top 10 show.

1020
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:27,280
And they were doing top 10 most like changing video games of all time, like video games

1021
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:30,800
that changed the scene of all time, arcade games that changed the scene of all time.

1022
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:31,800
What?

1023
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,320
Why is Pikachu humping Friendship Bear's arm?

1024
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,320
I don't know.

1025
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:40,560
Anyway, so they were doing like the top 10 games that changed arcades, and number one

1026
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,320
of course was Pac-Man.

1027
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:47,160
Number 10, this was cool, was Final Furlong.

1028
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,440
But number 8 was Dance Dance Revolution.

1029
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,440
Oh yay.

1030
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:56,440
Fucking G4TV, when they were talking about Dance Dance Revolution, guess what they showed a picture of?

1031
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:57,440
What?

1032
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,440
3D, uh, uh, Easy to Dancer.

1033
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:00,440
Easy to Dancer.

1034
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,440
What stupid fucks they are.

1035
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:05,440
They're stupid British.

1036
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:16,440
Um, but actually they, they had actually rounded up, um, they called, no, they said number whatever it was was Dance Dance Revolution, but they were actually talking about all the Bomani games, which is even worse.

1037
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:18,440
Anyway.

1038
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:19,440
This one's loud.

1039
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:23,440
Okay, here's some suggestions from the chat room for tonight's list list.

1040
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,440
Best Taka song?

1041
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:26,440
No.

1042
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:29,440
List of best ideas for a reality show?

1043
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:30,440
No.

1044
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:32,440
Worst Naoki song?

1045
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:33,440
No.

1046
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,440
Most influential video games?

1047
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:36,440
No.

1048
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,440
What's the idea?

1049
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:39,440
Worst Pokemon?

1050
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,440
No, that's retarded.

1051
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,440
Top of cool game shows hosted by Dick Clark?

1052
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:45,440
Yes.

1053
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,440
There's only two in like three that I can think of.

1054
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,960
We need to do top game shows.

1055
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:52,060
Alright, fine. Top game shows.

1056
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:57,740
Okay, agreed. We've never done that, have we? No. Okay, fine. Top game shows it is.

1057
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:03,100
Best freaking game show is the topic for tonight, so we will get to that after this quick break.

1058
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:05,100
Featuring songs from...

1059
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:10,980
Well, let's see, we've done... Eurobeat! Eurobeat! There's no one here to vote on anything.

1060
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:13,320
They'll be here. The chat room votes. Eurobeat.

1061
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:17,320
Yeah, they're gonna be, that's true, maybe we need to post Homeless List for a little bit.

1062
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:18,320
Play Drivin'.

1063
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:19,320
What?

1064
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,320
Play Drivin'.

1065
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,320
Eurobeat?

1066
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,320
What's Drivin' from?

1067
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,320
Play Drivin'.

1068
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:24,320
8 style?

1069
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,320
No.

1070
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:26,320
Drivin'.

1071
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,320
From 8 style, right?

1072
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:28,320
Yes.

1073
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,320
It's not Drivin', it's Drivin'.

1074
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,320
As in Drivin' in the car.

1075
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,320
It's a Naoki song.

1076
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:36,320
Alright, so we've done 7 style songs, 9 style songs, I guess we'll do 8 style songs now.

1077
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:39,240
So, we're going to do drive it if I have it.

1078
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,240
I don't know if I have it.

1079
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:45,180
I do. I swear I do somewhere.

1080
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:46,300
Oh, I got it.

1081
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:46,660
I got it.

1082
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:47,700
I got it.

1083
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:48,200
Nah, nah, nah.

1084
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:51,180
Okay. So, we're going to take a quick break with some eight-style songs.

1085
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:52,640
When we come back, we'll have Orange Crush.

1086
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,760
We'll do Listless at some point when the others get back

1087
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,380
and our general clusterfuck of random topics.

1088

01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:33,140
He'll know what I'm talking about, with 100k.

1093
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:57,180
again

1094
01:23:57,180 --> 01:24:00,180
baby you're so real, baby for sure

1095
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:03,180
i know we can't go home

1096
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:06,180
we're driving in your car

1097
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:09,180
we have never gone this far

1098
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:12,180
now's the time to come for us

1099
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:16,180
spend the night together now

1100
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:20,180
driving in your car

1101
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:24,180
you can get into my heart

1102
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:29,180
Let's say no, and we'll play tonight together

1103
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:31,180
We'll play tonight together

1104
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:33,180
It's rising in your heart

1105
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:36,180
Who knew we would come this far?

1106
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:39,180
I can't wait for us to spend

1107
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:43,180
The whole night together now

1108
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:45,180
It's rising in your soul

1109
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:48,180
And they can't give up so far

1110
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:51,180
I love you and you, I can't

1111
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:56,180
I'll always be forever more

1112
01:28:51,180 --> 01:29:10,180
I know this is it, but I can't admit It's all in my past

1113
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:16,180
So I can't ignore the fact No more your memory will last

1114
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:22,180
Deep within my mind I will always find emotions still remain

1115
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:29,180
Hold my heart still yet, set the fire still, but I can't put out the pain

1116
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:35,180
I would never have assumed you'd need me without mental wounds

1117
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:41,180
You know the reason why I can't forgive everybody

1118
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:48,180
You have left me not for life, just for what you've got, like a knife

1119
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:54,180
I can forgive and forget

1120
01:29:58,180 --> 01:30:02,180
Forgive and forget

1121
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:06,180
You've only got yourself a hand

1122
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:51,660
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1123
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:52,660
Go!

1124
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:58,100
Let's go right, go figure, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

1125
01:30:58,100 --> 01:30:59,100
Woohoo!

1126
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:00,100
Woohoo!

1127
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:01,100
Hello, boys and girls.

1128
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:02,100
Hi, Lucy!

1129
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:35,220
Target and we're right on the other side of the prison, so if there's ever a prison break-

1130
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:38,980
Next week, Storm's Lands will be hosted from my house.

1131
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:42,100
And all future weeks.

1132
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:43,100
It's fine.

1133
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:48,180
Oh, they're saying in the chat room that the ferret, or now it's the coyote or whatever

1134
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:49,180
that thing is-

1135
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:52,500
Yeah, I like talking to the coyote.

1136
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:56,580
It sounds like one of the animals from Happy Tree Friends.

1137
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:59,180
And then they say it sounds like Menchie.

1138
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:01,140
Menchie flavor, mmm.

1139
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:08,140
So, wow, it's just the three of us here now, the three hosts, it's weird.

1140
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:11,140
You should have been here this week.

1141
01:32:11,140 --> 01:32:13,140
Maren should have been here this week.

1142
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:18,140
Less crowded, less chances to get claustrophobia.

1143
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:20,140
Or catch SARS.

1144
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:25,140
Or catch SARS, yeah, because I still have it. Remember brain tumor, SARS, all at the same time?

1145
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:27,140
Yeah, it's awful.

1146
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:31,660
So is there, do we want to talk shit about any of the other people that are on this show

1147
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:32,660
usually?

1148
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:33,660
Well, you know what?

1149
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:34,660
That, that Brad.

1150
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:35,660
Oh, that Brad.

1151
01:32:35,660 --> 01:32:39,660
Congesting the server all by himself that I don't even play on.

1152
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:40,660
Man, he's so skinny.

1153
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:41,660
Yeah, what's up with that?

1154
01:32:41,660 --> 01:32:44,740
And that Ice Queen, what a fag.

1155
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:45,740
And Rice Princess?

1156
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:48,500
I haven't seen her eat rice in a year.

1157
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,540
How dare she call herself that?

1158
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:55,860
That reminds me, I have to use the rice cooker.

1159
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:56,860
You know what?

1160
01:32:56,860 --> 01:32:58,860
I dare the shit and it's time to flush.

1161
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:03,860
What was that laugh?

1162
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:05,860
I hate being sick.

1163
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:07,860
This is giving us SARS again.

1164
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:09,860
Every time I laugh I cough.

1165
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:17,860
I'm going to beat that thing senseless.

1166
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:19,860
Give it to me.

1167
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:27,980
I know, I thought of a fun thing we could do, since we were kind of making fun of G4

1168
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:31,980
before the break, I thought maybe we could take a look at the list, and this can be like

1169
01:33:31,980 --> 01:33:34,580
an ongoing thing, because there's a lot to talk about here.

1170
01:33:34,580 --> 01:33:38,860
We could talk about G4's list that they got together with the Entertainment Weekly.

1171
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:43,100
I'll just shut up and let that thing talk.

1172
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:44,100
Okay.

1173
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:45,100
Okay.

1174
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:46,100
Huh.

1175
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:48,580
I had to do the elementary school trick to make it work.

1176
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:50,580
Don't do it!

1177
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:52,580
Yeah, I gotta take that thing away.

1178
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:54,580
You see this? It's mine now.

1179
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:56,580
This is mine now.

1180
01:33:56,580 --> 01:33:58,580
Alright.

1181
01:33:58,580 --> 01:34:00,580
It's an ass for the bad touch.

1182
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:04,580
They have an ass shot for the bad touch, that's sweet.

1183
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:06,580
Is that the official background?

1184
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:08,580
Yes it is.

1185
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:12,580
Do they have the background for it can't get you out of my head?

1186
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:14,580
I'm just curious what it looks like.

1187
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:31,460
We are going to talk about G4's list of the 100 greatest games of all time that they got

1188
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:34,540
together with Entertainment Wheelie and we are going to make fun of it.

1189
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:37,700
Oh, you are going to go blow your nose.

1190
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:42,540
First off, if you happen to be watching G4 any time of the day, no matter what day, you

1191
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:45,560
you're gonna catch this god damn show because they play it

1192
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:47,120
all the time

1193
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:51,640
all the time

1194
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:55,680
so now we're gonna talk about the one hundred greatest video games of all time

1195
01:34:55,680 --> 01:35:00,300
according to a bunch of schmoes

1196
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:03,080
DDR is on the list I might add

1197
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:06,120
DDR is on the list so if you don't know where it clocks in

1198
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:09,960
uh... listen to us we'll tell you where it clocks in

1199
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:10,940
here we go

1200
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:12,940
And you're sitting on it, don't you feel special?

1201
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:15,940
Okay, so let's get everybody's thoughts and opinions on the top 100 games here.

1202
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:17,940
100 on their list.

1203
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:18,940
Missile Command.

1204
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:19,940
Yay.

1205
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:20,940
Missile Command was cool.

1206
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:21,940
Yay.

1207
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:22,940
It was like the Atari 2600.

1208
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:26,940
I have that on the 2600, 5200, a bunch of other things, and television.

1209
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:29,940
Wasn't that one of the ones they updated, like, way later?

1210
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:32,940
Yeah, there's Missile Command 2000, I think.

1211
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:33,940
Yeah.

1212
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:36,940
Number 99, XCOM UFO Defense.

1213
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:38,940
Um, whatever that was.

1214
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:45,380
And that was that game it was by microprose and you had the aliens that were it was like an alien strategy game basically

1215
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:52,420
Say moving on all right number 98 Frogger a

1216
01:35:54,420 --> 01:35:58,560
Konami game yes, yeah, it always makes me think of that episode of Seinfeld

1217
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:02,260
I'm not even that big a fan of Seinfeld, but I will never forget that episode of Seinfeld with the Frogger

1218
01:36:03,540 --> 01:36:06,620
It's the greatest. I've only seen one episode of Seinfeld and it was the last one

1219
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:12,420
They know why I went because it was at the red lion convention center by the mall and they gave out free food

1220
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:17,260
That's so ghetto fabulous I

1221
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:24,140
The only other episode I remembered three episodes of Seinfeld I remembered the grottiest one I

1222
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:26,620
got my his

1223
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:28,620
remember the Frogger one I

1224
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:30,300
remember the

1225
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:35,140
Masturbation one where they make the contest about who can go along to stop masturbating and then I remember the one

1226
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:40,140
Number one, where they go to a Chinese restaurant and they dare Elaine to steal an egg roll.

1227
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:41,140
Anyway, yeah.

1228
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:44,140
I don't remember the one where they all died.

1229
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:46,140
Oh wait, I dreamed that.

1230
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:51,140
Number 97, Secret of Mana.

1231
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:52,140
Why so low on the list?

1232
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:54,140
It needs to be higher, my god.

1233
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:55,140
I know.

1234
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:56,140
Fuck that.

1235
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:57,140
At least it wasn't Secret of Embermoor.

1236
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:58,140
Hey, yeah!

1237
01:36:58,140 --> 01:36:59,140
Question!

1238
01:36:59,140 --> 01:37:00,140
Keep going.

1239
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:04,140
Now, what do you think about second sense 2-3?

1240
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:06,140
Why didn't they ever release that here?

1241
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:07,140
They're going to.

1242
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:08,140
Are they?

1243
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:09,140
When?

1244
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:12,700
After they released the first Seiken Densetsu which was released as Final Fantasy Adventure.

1245
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:16,140
Is that what that Sword of Mana is that they're doing?

1246
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:18,220
Sword of Mana is just Seiken Densetsu 3?

1247
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:19,220
First one.

1248
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:20,860
It's the first Seiken Densetsu.

1249
01:37:20,860 --> 01:37:21,860
Really?

1250
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:28,620
Which was Final Fantasy Adventure when they first released it on the Game Boy.

1251
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:29,620
I'll be damned.

1252
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:32,460
And then we're supposed to be getting Legend of Mana and I've been hearing the rumor that

1253
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:35,100
we're supposed to be getting Seiken 3.

1254
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:36,100
We better.

1255
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:37,100
It would make me happy.

1256
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:38,100
We better.

1257
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:40,100
That would make me as happy as a little girl.

1258
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:46,000
Number 96 on their list, M-U-L-E, which is a game a lot of people probably don't remember,

1259
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,240
but if you did ever play it, this game was a shit.

1260
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:53,740
It was one of the first, like, multiplayer games that, um, it was just downright innovative

1261
01:37:53,740 --> 01:37:56,300
for its time, so it's well-deserved to mention on the list.

1262
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:58,940
You said downright.

1263
01:37:58,940 --> 01:38:03,000
Number 95, Golden Axe 2.

1264
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,220
You know what's funny?

1265
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:08,940
Golden Axe the Duel was the first game I played on the Saturn and it wasn't important.

1266
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:12,840
You know what I remember about Golden Axe was the ending where like it showed the people

1267
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:18,460
in the arcade and the heroes jumped out of the screen and trampled all the people in

1268
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:19,460
the arcade?

1269
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:20,460
That was great.

1270
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:22,740
That was the best part about Golden Axe was the ending.

1271
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:25,220
Number 94 is a game I've never fucking heard of.

1272
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:29,020
IL-2 Stromovik

1273
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:31,140
93, Joust

1274
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:31,980
ha

1275
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:35,620
Joust is like one of the games I play on Ultra-Cade all the time

1276
01:38:35,620 --> 01:38:41,340
You know what? They had the Nintendo version which was Balloon Fight

1277
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:43,140
Remember Balloon Fight?

1278
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:46,500
No. We who play Animal Crossing should have Balloon Fight. Yes, I know Balloon Fight.

1279
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:47,620
I'm just being difficult.

1280
01:38:47,620 --> 01:38:52,020
92, Super Star Wars

1281
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:54,140
You ever play it?

1282
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:58,140
It's okay. I don't think it should be on the top 100 videos of all time.

1283
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:01,140
Super Star Wars is great because of the debug mode. You could, like, skip levels.

1284
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:03,140
I didn't know there was a debug mode.

1285
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:06,140
There is, for all three of the Star Wars games on the Super Nintendo.

1286
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:07,140
Well, I'll be damned.

1287
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:09,140
I'll have to bring over my SNES one day.

1288
01:39:09,140 --> 01:39:10,140
Why?

1289
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:11,140
So you can play all the games.

1290
01:39:11,140 --> 01:39:12,140
Can we play Act Racer?

1291
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:14,140
Yeah, I have it.

1292
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:16,140
Because Act Racer is, like, my favorite Super Nintendo game ever.

1293
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:17,140
Go to 4.

1294
01:39:17,140 --> 01:39:18,140
I don't know what's on this list. I don't even know.

1295
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:19,140
Keep going.

1296
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:21,140
Spy Hunter!

1297
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:26,140
You know they're gonna make a movie out of Spy Hunter?

1298
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:28,140
That'd be kinda cool.

1299
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:30,140
Yes, Loki. And guess who's in it?

1300
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:31,140
Who?

1301
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:32,140
The Rock!

1302
01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:33,140
No shit.

1303
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:35,140
God. It's gonna be awful.

1304
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:40,140
Well, I wish we could, like, spray oil and click on his limousine.

1305
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:43,140
Did you ever play Spy Hunter, though, that was on the, um, PS2?

1306
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:44,140
That was pretty rad.

1307
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:45,140
No, I never did.

1308
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:46,140
It was pretty cool.

1309
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:48,140
Uh, 90.

1310
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:55,140
3. Crash Bandicoot 3 Warped. Gag! I hate Crash Bandicoot, it looks retarded. I don't know

1311
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:58,900
if that's the Crash Bandicoot game I would have put it in. I feel really ripped because

1312
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:02,780
I bought, what was that game? It's Crash Bandicoot, it's like Crash Bandicoot's answer to Mario

1313
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:08,380
Party. What was it called? Crash Party? Crash Party. It's awful. I wish I would have just

1314
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:12,000
bought Mario Party. I wanted the Sonic Party. Huh? I wanted the Sonic Party game. I have

1315
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,920
It's okay.

1316
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,200
I couldn't figure it out, but I'm lazy.

1317
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:20,400
I have no attentions now whatsoever.

1318
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,600
89, Castle Wolfenstein.

1319
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:23,600
Yeah.

1320
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:26,560
Now, is that referring to the original on the Apple IIe?

1321
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:27,560
I think not.

1322
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:30,600
Is it referring to the original?

1323
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:32,040
I watched this stupid thing.

1324
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:35,400
It's the original one they're talking about, not Wolfenstein 3D.

1325
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:37,520
Alright, fine.

1326
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:41,000
We have to give a nod to the original.

1327
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:45,720
I wouldn't put the original Wolfenstein above, like, M-U-L-E, but whatever.

1328
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:49,720
It was all about playing Doom and going to the Wolfenstein level by warping there.

1329
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:50,720
Sheesh.

1330
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:54,120
Uh, number 88, FIFA Soccer 2003.

1331
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:55,120
Whatever.

1332
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:56,120
Whatever.

1333
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:57,720
We don't talk about sports on this show.

1334
01:40:57,720 --> 01:41:00,960
87 was Battlezone.

1335
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:01,960
Battlezone was cool.

1336
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:03,680
Remember the tank?

1337
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:04,680
You don't remember Battlezone?

1338
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:05,680
I didn't play Battlezone.

1339
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:07,240
It was a vector game and you were in the tank?

1340
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:09,000
Was it on the Vectrex?

1341
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
I think it might have been.

1342
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
It was Atari's game.

1343
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
You know we've been looking for a Vectrex.

1344
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Really?

1345
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Yeah.

1346
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
I wouldn't doubt it.

1347
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Uh, 86.

1348
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Oh, it smells like fabric softener.

1349
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Oh, no wonder.

1350
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
And thank God this game made the list.

1351
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
86 was Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo.

1352
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Amen.

1353
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,000
This must have, no that was Gem Fighter.

1354
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Did they have, not Gem, but Pocket Fighter, they have a second one out now.

1355
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
When are they going to release a new version of Puzzle Fighter?

1356
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
That's the game they need to take online.

1357
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Forget DDR.

1358
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
You know what's awesome?

1359
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:41,560
puzzle fighter the one that's on the Dreamcast that was awesome because

1360
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:46,160
there's like a columns mode in it as well as another type of mode in there

1361
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:50,120
it's just like three different modes XYZ mode as well plus it had those

1362
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:57,760
Sakura vocal song in there 85 Prince of Persia I know Prince of Persia was so

1363
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:03,680
like overrated. You had to ask all over your old gaming magazines to this day. Oh my god and how many freaking

1364
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:04,680
Game systems?

1365
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:05,680
Was that game on?

1366
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:06,680
All of them.

1367
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:07,680
All of them.

1368
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:11,120
You could not, if you owned a game system of anything you could get Prince of Persia.

1369
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:13,600
Uh, 84 was Asteroids.

1370
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:14,600
Yeah.

1371
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:15,600
Next.

1372
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:16,600
83.

1373
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:17,600
Daytona USA.

1374
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,600
Daytona.

1375
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:23,560
I never even played that.

1376
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:25,680
What do you love about Daytona, Logie?

1377
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:30,440
It's fun and a lot of the arcades, especially the ones like in Reno and stuff, they've got

1378
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:35,720
like 16 machines hooked together, so it's like one hell of a race, and normally they're

1379
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:39,400
like huge lap settings, so you're like racing about 12 people and stuff.

1380
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:43,400
I have nightmares though about that game for one reason. I worked in an arcade where they

1381
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:52,400
never turned off the attract for that game. I'm like, oh god, make it stop. You know there

1382
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:56,560
was actually a really funny penny arcade to that? I don't remember where exactly it was,

1383
01:42:56,560 --> 01:43:02,680
was one of the older ones from a couple of years ago. And I remember Gabe, but the other

1384
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:08,560
guy was sitting down at the computer and Gabe walks up and goes, doo doo doo doo doo day

1385
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:14,120
tone, and the other guy reaches over and grabs out his heart. He goes ahhh! Like that. Oh

1386
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:21,120
my lord. Uh, 82, ghouls and ghosts. Yes! Freaking Makai Mora. 81, gauntlet. Red Valkyrie is

01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:32,560
80, Silent Hill 2.

1390
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:34,660
Hey, Yamaoka Music.

01:43:34,660 --> 01:43:35,920
Right on.

1392
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:39,640
How far do we want to take this list? Let's keep going. Keep going.

1393
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:42,180
79, King's Quest. Next.

1394
01:43:42,180 --> 01:43:47,820
King's Quest was awesome. This should have been in the top ten. King's Quest was boring. I'm sorry, King's Quest should have been in the top ten.

1395
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:49,820
It's one of the most innovative video games on the list.

1396
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:51,820
Maniac Mansion better be on that list.

1397
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:52,820
Sierra games from the 90s.

1398
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:54,820
Maniac Mansion better be on that list. Next.

1399
01:43:54,820 --> 01:43:55,820
I don't know if it is.

1400
01:43:55,820 --> 01:43:56,820
It's not.

1401
01:43:56,820 --> 01:43:58,820
This freakin' dolts.

1402
01:43:58,820 --> 01:44:02,820
But if there had been no King's Quest, there would have never been a Maniac Mansion.

1403
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:04,820
Um, whatever.

1404
01:44:04,820 --> 01:44:06,820

1405
01:44:06,820 --> 01:44:08,820

Yes! Oh my god, yes.

1408
01:44:12,820 --> 01:44:15,820
I love Saturn Bomberman and I could not find a copy.

1409
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:22,820
Actually, you know what was really good? The Bomberman games on the, um, on the, uh, Turbo Graphics.

1410
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:26,820
Bomberman 93, Bomberman 94. Those were good.

1411
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:30,820
Okay, we had a request from the chat room to just skip ahead to 50.

1412
01:44:30,820 --> 01:44:31,320
Okay.

1413
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:32,820
You want me to read the rest of these really fast?

1414
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:33,320
Yeah.

1415
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:37,820
Okay, give your, Jamie, you're gonna give your one word reaction to each of these games as I name them off, okay?

1416
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:38,820

01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,320
Which one?

01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,320
The one that's gonna piss you off.

1427
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,320
It's like a puzzle bobble, you bitches!

1428
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:05,320
No, no. I'm almost positive. Aren't they talking about...

1429
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:07,320
Oh, no, they are talking about puzzle bobble in that case.

Bitches.

1431

But I have it on Saturn.

1432

Loki, you saw it. Were they talking about puzzle bobble or the other one?

1433
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:17,320
What? Forget it. Forget it.

1434
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:20,320
They're talking about Puzzle Bubble and Busta Move.

1435
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:22,320
Were they talking about Groove or what?

1436
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:24,320
They're talking about Puzzle Bubble.

1437
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:25,320

Awesome.

1453
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:54,320

1454
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:55,320

He's the man.

01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:55,320

1488
01:46:57,320 --> 01:46:58,320
Whatever

1489
01:46:58,320 --> 01:46:59,320
51 Contra

1490
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:01,320
50 Pitfall

1491
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:06,320
I like the speed way of doing it, let's do the speed way all the way to 20

1492
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:10,320
Let's do the speed thing all the way to 20, okay?

1493
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:11,320
Alright.

1494
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:13,320
Oh, I can't wait for this one.

1495
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:14,320
49!

1496
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:15,320
Pokemon!

1497
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:16,320
AHHH!

1498

48!

1499
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:18,320
Chrono Trigger.

1500
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:19,320
Best game.

1501
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:20,320
47, Tron.

1502
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:21,320
Hee!

1503
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:22,320
40, I, wait!

1504
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:23,320
Go back to 48!

1505
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:24,320
Chrono Trigger!

1506
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:25,320
Why so fucking low?

1507
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:26,320
That's a-

1508
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:27,320
They have fucking retards.

1509
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:28,320
DOLT!

1510
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:29,320
Hey, that's my word.

1511
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:30,320
47, Tron.

1512
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:31,320
46, Unreal.

1513
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:32,320
Hey, that's not rude.

1514
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:33,320
47 Tron.

1515
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:34,320
Mmm.

1516
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:35,320
46 Unreal.

1517
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:37,320
45 Donkey Kong.

1518
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:38,320
Hey!

1519
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:39,320
Banana.

1520
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:41,320
44 Age of Empires II, the age of kings.

1521
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:42,320
Whatever.

1522
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:43,320
What?

1523
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:45,320
How does a game like that get above Chrono Trigger?

1524
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:47,320
Because retards made this list.

1525
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:48,320
God!

1526
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:49,320
Oof!

1527
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:50,320
And then this one.

1528
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:51,320
NHL 93.

1529
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:52,320
What the fuck ever.

1530
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:53,320
At 43.

1531
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:54,320
42 Quake II.

1532
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:55,320
Hey!

1533
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:58,320
Quake II has a gachapon patch to it.

1534
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,320
41 Deus Ex.

1535
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:03,320
40, Dance Dance Revolution

1536
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:07,320
Why so high?

1537
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:14,320
39, beating out Dance Dance Revolution, Mortal Kombat 2

1538
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:21,320
Actually I like Mortal Kombat 2 because I liked playing on the beta kits

1539
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:24,320
where you could do the infinite juggles and float

1540
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:27,320
and start off your game against Shao Kahn

1541
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:30,320
Um, where the hell was I?

1542
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:32,320
I was in high school.

1543
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:35,320
38, Sonic the Hedgehog.

1544
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:38,320
37, SimCity.

1545
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:40,320
36, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell.

1546
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,320
Whatever, I hate Tom Clancy games.

1547
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:44,320
35, Battlefield 1942.

1548
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:49,320
34, this is a good pick, Ultima IV, Quest of the Avatar.

1549
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:51,320
33, Duke Nukem 3D.

1550
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:53,320
Your face, your ass, what's the difference?

1551
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:55,320
32, Tekken 2.

1552
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:58,520
Hey, Tekken 2 had June in it. I love that game.

1553
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:06,520
31, Diablo 2, 30, Mario Kart 64, 29, Medal of Honor, Allied Assault, 28, Galaga.

1554
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:08,320
Hey, it's Galaga.

1555
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:13,320
27, Monkey Island 2, LeChuck's Revenge.

1556
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:17,120
26, Command and Conquer, Red Alert.

1557
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:17,920
Whatever.

1558
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:20,620
25, Star Wars X, Wing Alliance.

1559
01:49:20,620 --> 01:49:21,420
Neat.

1560
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:24,220
24, Castlevania, Symphony of the Night.

1561
01:49:24,220 --> 01:49:25,420
Oh my god, yes!

1562
01:49:26,620 --> 01:49:27,420
That should be one.

1563
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:29,220
Twenty-three, Metal Gear Solid.

1564
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:30,020
Yes.

1565
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:31,720
Twenty-two, Resident Evil.

1566
01:49:32,020 --> 01:49:32,520
Yeah.

1567
01:49:32,620 --> 01:49:34,020
Twenty-one, EverQuest.

1568
01:49:34,620 --> 01:49:37,420
Gag, gag, gag, kill it, die.

1569
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:42,720
Okay, now that the others are back, we can slow this down a little bit to really rant about the top twenty.

1570
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:47,220
So, I know Brad has a few things he wants to say about some of the ones he heard just coming in the door.

1571
01:49:50,220 --> 01:49:50,720
Brad?

1572
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:53,220
What is this big thing?

1573
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:57,220
This, by the way, is G4 Entertainment Weekly's list of top 100 games of all time.

1574
01:49:57,220 --> 01:50:04,220
Okay, I've read so many of these lists over the years, and I already know when they do these top 100 things, that they get really lazy and they kind of just...

1575
01:50:04,220 --> 01:50:10,220
Because you can't really concentrate on every little thing, so they just start splashing games here and there because they don't know where to put them.

1576
01:50:10,220 --> 01:50:14,220
My opinion about some of these games being at like 24, 25, whatever it was,

1577
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:27,220
Castlevania Civilian Knight, in my opinion, should be up there in the top 5 at least, but I haven't read what their other top 19 or 18 or 20 is, so I don't know why they're thinking these other games. Do they have explanations for why these games should be in the top 20?

1578
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:30,220
If you watch the show, but we're not endorsing that.

1579
01:50:30,220 --> 01:50:31,220
Good.

1580
01:50:31,220 --> 01:50:34,220
Okay. Well, as I name off these top 20...

1581
01:50:34,220 --> 01:50:36,220
Your solid should also be up in the top 5, but whatever.

1582
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:40,940
But whatever as I name off these top 20 you can you can tell us if they were deserving Brad

1583
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:44,700
You'll be the you can be the critic on if they're deserving of being in the top 20. Okay, Brad

1584
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:47,580
Where'd the ice queen go?

1585
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:50,420
Okay

1586
01:50:51,580 --> 01:50:54,180
All right, here we go, I don't need a quarter

1587
01:50:56,060 --> 01:51:00,280
Here we go kids number 20 super Metroid

1588
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:02,740
dude, god, yeah

1589
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:04,740
number 20 super Metroid, um

1590
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:14,740
Definitely deserving of being in the top 20, but I don't know if it should be at the lowest of the top 20. I don't know what the other games are, so.

1591
01:51:14,740 --> 01:51:17,740
Excellent game, though. Definitely should be in the top 20.

1592
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:19,740
19, Ms. Pac-Man.

1593
01:51:19,740 --> 01:51:20,740
What?

1594
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:22,740
If you're talk- What?

1595
01:51:22,740 --> 01:51:27,740
If you're talking of all time, come on, Ms. Pac-Man of all time.

1596
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:28,740
No.

1597
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:29,740
Yes.

1598
01:51:29,740 --> 01:51:30,740
I'm sorry.

1599
01:51:30,740 --> 01:51:31,740
Yes.

1600
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:32,740
Deserving of top 20.

1601
01:51:32,740 --> 01:51:37,740
is so, has so little gameplay comparing to something like Super Metroid.

1602
01:51:37,740 --> 01:51:42,140
It should be, it should be in the top 100, but maybe like at 99.

1603
01:51:42,140 --> 01:51:43,100
That's sad.

1604
01:51:43,100 --> 01:51:45,460
If you were ten years older you would not say that.

1605
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:48,420
What the fuck? I remember when it came out. I know.

1606
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:52,620
But that was the game that everybody was playing in the arcade, like now it's... It doesn't matter.

1607
01:51:52,620 --> 01:51:57,300
The game itself, as far as gameplay is concerned, that's the reason why we play video games, because they're fun.

1608
01:51:57,300 --> 01:52:02,800
And Ms. Pac-Man is not nearly as fun as something that has as much gameplay as Symphony Night or Super Metroid.

1609
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:07,800
I don't care if it's, oh, it brings you back to your past or whatever. It's still not as fun.

1610
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:09,800
I don't think it has anything to do with that.

1611
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:12,800
If that's what it does to me, then you're playing video games for the wrong reason in my opinion.

1612
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:16,300
Yeah, but do you own a magazine? I don't think so, so, huh?

1613
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:19,800
And I will. And it'll be very Nazi-ish.

1614
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:22,800
Um, no Ms. Pac-Man for you.

1615
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:24,800
I like baby Pac-Man.

1616
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:29,800
Number 18, Soul Calibur.

1617
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:31,800
Yes, Soul Calibur, yes.

1618
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:35,800
But you can't forget the Soul Edge.

1619
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:37,800
Which is not on the list, I can tell you.

1620
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:41,800
I think the reason why they would put that up there as far as...

1621
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:44,800
because Soul Calibur, they're probably talking about the console version.

1622
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:51,800
It kind of pushed the fighting game on the console to...

1623
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:54,800
It pushed the envelope on it. It gave you a lot more extra features.

1624
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:57,800
It was kind of one of the first things, the big ones, to do that.

1625
01:52:57,800 --> 01:53:02,800
And Soul Edge was a great game on the console, but Soul Calibur really pushed it to the limit.

1626
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:05,800
One thing to consider also, when they brought out Soul Calibur on the Dreamcast,

1627
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:08,800
the graphics were better than the arcade version.

1628
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:12,800
Which is like, had never been done before.

1629
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:16,800
Exactly, and that's probably one of the reasons why it's up there.

1630
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:19,800
at least it's still caliber to make it look like a Dreamcast version.

1631
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:49,800
Exactly! Matt knows what I'm talking about.

1632
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:51,800
No, I think...

1633
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:53,800
I want Striperella the game.

1634
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:59,800
Hold on, hold on. As silly as Matt's kind of being joking, it's kind of true.

1635
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:04,800
A big-breasted, like a female who kicked ass in a video game and became like an icon.

1636
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:10,800
Basically like the logo for the Playstation for a while was Lara Croft.

1637
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:15,800
I mean, I hate the game, but it did do something huge to...

1638
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:22,800
And that probably sounds hypocritical because I said it like Ms. Pac-Man because it's not fun.

1639
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:31,800
That was actually what I was going to say because, and I preempted it, because Ms. Pac-Man, well actually not Ms. Pac-Man so much as Pac-Man.

1640
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:35,800
In the sense of Tomb Raider 2 you could blow her up and throw her off the balcony and make her break her neck.

1641
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:44,800
Here's another thing, in Ms. Pac-Man you can't swan dive off a 30 story cliff and kill yourself, but you can do that in Tomb Raider and that's what makes Tomb Raider fun.

1642
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:48,800
We get to see her with her broken neck.

1643
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:52,800
Uh, moving on. 16, Halo.

1644
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:56,800
I haven't played it, so I guess I'm not a true gamer. 15, and this-

1645
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:00,800
Wait, Halo is freaking gorgeous, and actually, I can probably say that yeah.

1646
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:04,800
They should be up there. You've played a few FPSes, I believe.

1647
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:08,800
First person shooters, right?

1648
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:12,800
Um, I- hold on, I need to get-

1649
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:17,800
Jamie, I need to get something. I think you've played quite a few first person shooters before, right?

1650
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:24,800
So you know the differences. I've never played Halo, so what's so great about Halo that makes it different than other first person shooters?

1651
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:31,800
It's just really interactive, very responsive, and you've got so many different levels you can play on and you can play it in different ways.

1652
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:41,800
Plus when you play multiplayer, you can play cooperatively with another person instead of having, excuse me, deathmatch and like burping up.

1653
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:50,800
Anyway, but on top of that, it's really pretty, I mean really pretty, and it really shows what the Xbox can do, honestly.

1654
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:56,800
And for me, even though Xbox isn't my favorite system, I'd have to say that yeah, that has to be up there.

1655
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:58,800
And by the way, if Steel Battalion's not on the list, I'm going to scream.

1656
01:55:58,800 --> 01:55:59,800
It's not.

1657
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:03,800
Okay, moving on to number 15.

1658
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:08,800
And this is a game I think should be in the top three, but it's not, but whatever.

1659
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:10,800
15, Civilization II.

1660
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,800
What, um, yeah.

1661
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:16,800
The greatest strategy game on the computer of all time. Period.

1662
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:18,800
Get a rope?

1663
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:29,800
No, Matt's saying get a rope. Um, Civilization 2 may not be my type of game, but I've seen, I like Civilization 1.

1664
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:37,800
I guess I wasn't as much into strategy games as I am, like adventure stuff, but I could see how it's so good because I did like Civilization 1 for a while.

1665
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:45,800
Then it started to grade on me or whatever, but, I don't know, Sid Meier, I mean, he's just, I guess he's a genius when it comes to making strategy games, simulation games and stuff, so.

1666
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:51,800
I think also, Civilization can kind of be seen, this is the way I look at it, it's, um, strategy games for dummies.

1667
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:56,800
It's a very accessible kind of game. Like, you don't really have to be into strategy games to play them.

1668
01:56:56,800 --> 01:57:02,800
Well, that's what I'm saying, Sid Meier kind of makes his games kind of user-friendly, even though they have a lot of strategy involved.

1669
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:11,800
You can get into it even if you're kind of, I mean, like the Sims, it can get pretty complicated, but it's pretty actually, it shows you how to play pretty easily.

1670
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:12,800
Alright, moving on.

1671
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:16,800
Fourteen. Tony Hawk's pro skater.

1672
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:18,800
Yeah, I'd have to say so.

1673
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:25,800
Changed the face of skateboard games forever. I mean, skateboard games, whatever. I need her to die.

1674
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:29,800
Skate or die should be above, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1675
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:31,800
In my opinion, or 720.

1676
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:33,800
Menace Beach. Menace Beach.

1677
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:36,800
720. 720, hey, that's cool.

1678
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:39,800
Um, no, PNC Surf Designs.

1679
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:40,800
Yeah.

1680
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:44,800
Um, no, but seriously, to me there basically are only two skateboard games,

1681
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:47,800
Tony Hawk Bros Skater and Skater Die, so...

1682
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:50,800
That goes to show you how good Tony Hawk is.

1683
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:55,800
Come on, 720, what other game do you get chased by bees?

1684
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:56,800
Again...

1685
01:57:56,800 --> 01:58:00,800
Didn't that happen in Paperboy? Shut up.

1686
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:01,800
No, Paperboy's not on the list.

1687
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:02,800
God, Paperboy's not on the list?

1688
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:03,800
They're Crystal Castles?

1689
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:04,800
No.

1690
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:05,800
Marvel Madness?

1691
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:06,800
Nope.

1692
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:07,800
Those retards.

1693
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:08,800
Okay, here we go.

1694
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:10,800
13, Gran Turismo.

1695
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:11,800
Oh.

1696
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:16,800
Again, changed totally the course of racing games.

1697
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:23,680
And all the, not just realistic driving engine, but like, such a design, you know, aspect,

1698
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:27,800
like fine-tuning your cars and everything, it being like the main reason to even play

1699
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:28,800
the game.

1700
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:35,800
changed the direction.

1701
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:03,800
But that was to mean the whole Final Fantasy series.

1702
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:06,800
If they meant the whole series, if they truly meant that, that's forgivable.

1703
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:13,800
But I think they said Final Fantasy VII probably because more people know about Final Fantasy VII than any other Final Fantasy, because it really changed.

1704
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:19,800
One thing about Final Fantasy VII is that it brought it into, I guess, the modern age of games.

1705
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:27,800
and it right and it was mostly although although I have to say though that it

1706
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:32,380
was now that I've gone back to play it again I'm still hoping that they did the

1707
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:35,460
rumor proves out true and that they do an updated version because it would

1708
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:42,620
really benefit from it sorry we can't hear ice cream because he has no mic um

1709
01:59:42,620 --> 01:59:52,700
What were you saying Matt?

1710
01:59:52,700 --> 01:59:58,740
What I was saying for anybody that cares was that Final Fantasy 7 was really, really good

1711
01:59:58,740 --> 02:00:04,020
just because of the fact that it revolutionized the eye candy for Final Fantasy.

1712
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:05,020
It was the first eye candy.

1713
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:09,180
It doesn't look very good now, but for its time it looked really, really good.

1714
02:00:09,180 --> 02:00:12,420
And it had really good backgrounds, yeah.

1715
02:00:12,420 --> 02:00:30,420
The thing that the people that are like kind of like gaming purists or Final Fantasy 6 purists or whatever would say is that that's a bad thing that revolutionized the eye candy thing because Squaresoft for a while started going only for the cinematics and the eye candy for a while and they just forgot about gameplay when it comes to like Final Fantasy 8.

1716
02:00:30,420 --> 02:00:33,420
That's my opinion.

1717
02:00:33,420 --> 02:00:34,420
Exactly.

1718
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:35,420
Jamie says 10 was good.

1719
02:00:35,420 --> 02:00:40,420
I think they kind of went back to mixing the gameplay with the cinematics.

1720
02:00:40,420 --> 02:00:45,420
There was something I was going to say.

1721
02:00:45,420 --> 02:00:48,420
Do you want me to, can I elaborate on the Final Fantasy VII Remake thing?

1722
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:49,420
Keep going, yeah.

1723
02:00:49,420 --> 02:00:54,420
Okay. Jamie was saying she really hopes the rumor about Final Fantasy VII Remake on PS2 is true.

1724
02:00:54,420 --> 02:01:00,420
They did an interview with, well actually Squaresoft posted something to the users about it.

1725
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:05,420
We've started to make sequels to Final Fantasies with Final Fantasy X-2 coming out.

1726
02:01:05,420 --> 02:01:07,420
Which other games would you like there to be a sequel to?

1727
02:01:07,420 --> 02:01:10,420
Overwhelmingly, people said Final Fantasy VII.

1728
02:01:10,420 --> 02:01:12,420
Squaresoft rebutled by saying,

1729
02:01:12,420 --> 02:01:17,420
we don't have the time or effort to remake the engine for Final Fantasy VII.

1730
02:01:17,420 --> 02:01:21,420
Of course, everybody said, use X2's engine. We use whatever.

1731
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:25,420
Now, so, if that's true, that they don't have the time, money, or effort to make it,

1732
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:27,420
they're not going to be able to remake Final Fantasy VII.

1733
02:01:27,420 --> 02:01:32,420
But there was a rumor, and it was confirmed that eventually they were going to remake Final Fantasy VII.

1734
02:01:32,420 --> 02:01:33,420
So, I don't know.

1735
02:01:33,420 --> 02:01:36,420
Squaresoft's got their head up their asses now, so who knows?

1736
02:01:36,420 --> 02:01:43,420
Alright. Moving on to the list. I'll just say it, number 11 is GoldenEye 007.

1737
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:49,420
That game was actually pretty good, but that game actually did make me throw up.

1738
02:01:49,420 --> 02:01:57,420
I don't care if it's the best Nintendo 64 game ever made, it's undeserving of being in the top 20 in my opinion.

1739
02:01:57,420 --> 02:02:07,420
The way it got up there is because if it wasn't for that game, Halo wouldn't be around, because it did make first person shooters on the console a popular thing.

1740
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:10,420
Especially multiplayer first person shooters on the console.

1741
02:02:10,420 --> 02:02:13,420
That's because there was nothing else on the console.

1742
02:02:13,420 --> 02:02:21,420
No, before all there was, you had to have a computer and a LAN, you know, to play multiplayer shooters.

1743
02:02:21,420 --> 02:02:25,420
And then all of a sudden here comes Nintendo 64 with their only good game besides Zelda.

1744
02:02:25,420 --> 02:02:27,420
What about Faceball 2000?

1745
02:02:27,420 --> 02:02:29,420
Faceball?

1746
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:31,420
That was all I wanted to know.

1747
02:02:31,420 --> 02:02:33,420
Yeah, but it was a multiplayer game.

1748
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:35,420
Have a nice day.

1749
02:02:35,420 --> 02:02:37,420
Sadly enough, I played through the whole game of it.

1750
02:02:37,420 --> 02:02:39,420
I weep for you.

1751
02:02:39,420 --> 02:02:43,420
Speaking of, you know what I wish they had done?

1752
02:02:43,420 --> 02:02:47,420
I wish that they had actually done the Satellaview games in the States.

1753
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:49,420
The Satellaview games.

1754
02:02:49,420 --> 02:02:53,420
If you look on the bottom of your screen for Nintendo, there's this thing that will pull out.

1755
02:02:53,420 --> 02:02:58,220
out that's where a modem was supposed to go why isn't north and south on that list

1756
02:03:00,860 --> 02:03:04,380
yes they should have done the modem thing because they had the best version of zelda of

1757
02:03:05,180 --> 02:03:10,460
zelda on that all right moving on i'm going to try to kind of jam through this list because we have

1758
02:03:10,460 --> 02:03:17,900
we have some other segments left we got to do um number 10 was street fighter 2 yes next brad

1759
02:03:17,900 --> 02:03:23,900
Hey, Street Fighter II started my first fangirl crush, other than Jed Nelson.

1760
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:26,900
It was Ryu. Hello.

1761
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:28,900
Street Fighter II is what got me into arcades.

1762
02:03:28,900 --> 02:03:32,900
Okay, Street Fighter II is a great game. I love it, I always will.

1763
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:38,900
But it kinda is, to me, kinda like the Ms. Pac-Man thing I said.

1764
02:03:38,900 --> 02:03:42,900
It started a new type of game.

1765
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:48,900
A lot of people say that Street Fighter II is the, I guess you'd say the pong of our generation.

1766
02:03:48,900 --> 02:03:49,900
The pong?

1767
02:03:49,900 --> 02:03:52,900
Pong, not bong.

1768
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:55,900
Because it really got our generation into the arcades.

1769
02:03:55,900 --> 02:04:01,900
But the fighting genre has been changed so much over the years and in good ways.

1770
02:04:01,900 --> 02:04:04,900
There's so many better fighting games in Street Fighter II.

1771
02:04:04,900 --> 02:04:07,900
But it is deserving of being on that list.

1772
02:04:07,900 --> 02:04:16,900
It's one of those things where it's kind of more of a nod to the genre, like Ms. Pac-Man was, like there would be no maze game without, but in that case they should have put Pac-Man, not Ms. Pac-Man, but whatever.

1773
02:04:16,900 --> 02:04:20,900
Yeah, so I agree that it should be at the, near the top of the list, but...

1774
02:04:21,900 --> 02:04:26,900
Oh! Loki thinks, Loki thinks they put Ms. Pac-Man on the list because it got girls to play games.

1775
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:28,900
Well that's what they said in the goddamn show!

1776
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:29,900
Whatever.

1777
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:37,300
Well, the whole thing about Street Fighter 2 is that it was so widely popular that it

1778
02:04:37,300 --> 02:04:42,740
really blew the doors open, and the thing is, when I actually bought my own Super Nintendo,

1779
02:04:42,740 --> 02:04:45,980
the first game I got was Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo.

1780
02:04:45,980 --> 02:04:47,940
That was my game.

1781
02:04:47,940 --> 02:04:51,500
And I was such a Ryu fangirl, and I still am.

1782
02:04:51,500 --> 02:04:54,340
I used E. Honda because he was fat like me.

1783
02:04:54,340 --> 02:04:55,340
Okay.

1784
02:04:55,340 --> 02:04:56,980
Number 9.

1785
02:04:56,980 --> 02:05:07,540
Starcraft and Warcraft. If I have to play another RTS game, I will put a gun to my head

1786
02:05:07,540 --> 02:05:15,020
and pull the trigger. I don't like real time strategy games. And they did not, how could

1787
02:05:15,020 --> 02:05:19,020
you say Starcraft and Warcraft? I think they should be in the top 20 but not above Civilization.

1788
02:05:19,020 --> 02:05:24,220
Oh hell no. Dude, fucking Red Alert, that game rocks. I love Command and Conquer. No,

1789
02:05:24,220 --> 02:05:28,420
Command & Conquer Ghost will be a lot better, but that's a first-person shooting, so moving on.

1790
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:32,740
The only red alert that's cool is the transformer.

1791
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:37,120
Number eight.

1792
02:05:37,120 --> 02:05:40,080
Another series, Super Mario 64.

1793
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:47,420
That was actually very fun. Dan and I, when I first moved in with Dan, we would just spend hours all night playing Mario 64.

1794
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:50,060
Like trying to do the special jump to get to the roof.

1795
02:05:50,060 --> 02:05:59,060
I agree with definitely with putting Mario in the top ten. I actually think it ought to be higher, but I don't agree with the game they highlighted.

1796
02:05:59,060 --> 02:06:02,060
And it started up Mario Sunshine. We wouldn't have Mario Sunshine without it.

1797
02:06:02,060 --> 02:06:08,060
I agree, but I think Mario Brothers 3 is the one they should have kind of picked to lead the pack. I think that was the best Mario game they made.

1798
02:06:08,060 --> 02:06:12,060
See, I feel like Mario World better than Mario 3.

1799
02:06:12,060 --> 02:06:22,060
Hold on, hold on, hold on, yes, Matt's saying Super Mario 64 and Sunshine are different.

1800
02:06:22,060 --> 02:06:29,060
Okay, here's why Jamie made the comparison.

1801
02:06:29,060 --> 02:06:36,060
Because Super Mario, as in Super Mario on Nintendo, is an original platform side-scorer game.

1802
02:06:36,060 --> 02:06:40,060
Whereas Mario 64 is a 3D platformer and it plays differently.

1803
02:06:40,060 --> 02:06:45,060
The idea is similar, but it plays completely differently because it's in a 3D realm.

1804
02:06:45,060 --> 02:06:48,060
And because of Mario 64 we have games like, uh, Monkey...

1805
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:50,060
What's it called? That PlayStation game? Super Monkey Ball?

1806
02:06:50,060 --> 02:06:51,060
Ape Escape.

1807
02:06:51,060 --> 02:06:52,060
Oh.

1808
02:06:52,060 --> 02:06:55,060
Ape Escape. Another 3D platformer game. It's like Jak and Daxter, I think.

1809
02:06:55,060 --> 02:06:57,060
And, like, these games that are pretty popular, I hear.

1810
02:06:57,060 --> 02:06:58,060
Spyro.

1811
02:06:58,060 --> 02:07:01,060
Spyro. I didn't really like Spyro, but it is popular.

1812
02:07:01,060 --> 02:07:05,060
You know, everyone always forgets about what Mario is missing.

1813
02:07:05,060 --> 02:07:07,060
Because that game is so fast!

1814
02:07:07,060 --> 02:07:09,060
Do you know what that is?

1815
02:07:09,060 --> 02:07:10,060
Do you know what that is?

1816
02:07:10,060 --> 02:07:12,060
It's Nintendo's version of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego

1817
02:07:12,060 --> 02:07:15,060
and it's a bad interpretation of it.

1818
02:07:15,060 --> 02:07:17,060
Alright, we gotta move on with this list.

1819
02:07:17,060 --> 02:07:20,060
I hate to say it, but if we don't get through this list

1820
02:07:20,060 --> 02:07:22,060
we're not going to be able to get the FUs of the week.

1821
02:07:22,060 --> 02:07:24,060
Oh my god, no way!

1822
02:07:24,060 --> 02:07:26,060
Okay, I know, we haven't even done the FUs of the week yet.

1823
02:07:26,060 --> 02:07:28,060
So, number seven.

1824
02:07:28,060 --> 02:07:30,060
This is, I want to see Brad's reaction to this.

1825
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:32,060
Number seven, The Sims.

1826
02:07:32,060 --> 02:07:35,360
Number seven?

1827
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:40,760
And I actually agree with this. I agree with it because it's the top selling computer game of all time.

1828
02:07:40,760 --> 02:07:45,400
Period. I mean, and it's accessible to everybody.

1829
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:48,960
It's a video game that has no limits.

1830
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:52,560
Literally. I mean, boys, girls, men, women,

1831
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:55,920
children, everybody can play this game. It's very accessible and everybody has fun with it.

1832
02:07:55,920 --> 02:08:00,480
The only problem with The Sims is that it has no goal. There's no objective, but in a way

1833
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:04,480
That's kind of the appeal of it. It kind of made way for games like Animal Crossing.

1834
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:09,480
Isn't that all Sid Meier's games? They have no goal. Not even Civilization has a goal.

1835
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:11,480
Sid Meier did not do the Sims, if I'm not mistaken.

1836
02:08:11,480 --> 02:08:12,480
Are you serious?

1837
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:18,480
Let me elaborate on that. They actually, the PC versions have no goal.

1838
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:22,480
No, overall your goal obviously would be no successful and whatever.

1839
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:27,480
But in the console versions, they do have goal-oriented things in there.

1840
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:32,480
Because, obviously, you're limited to what you can hold on the console and stuff.

1841
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:34,480
Huh? Did you say my name?

1842
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:36,480
Alright. Here we go.

1843
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:39,480
Number 6. Half-Life.

1844
02:08:41,480 --> 02:08:42,480
Any comments?

1845
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:44,480
Okay, I played Half-Life.

1846
02:08:44,480 --> 02:08:46,480
Half-Life isn't that good.

1847
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:48,480
Hold on, Matt's saying Half-Life isn't that good.

1848
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:53,480
Half-Life kind of, it changed first person shooters.

1849
02:08:53,480 --> 02:09:18,480
After Half-Life, these games started coming out kind of like, I think System Shock 2 and stuff came out after Half-Life, I can't remember, somebody could probably call me on that, and they started becoming more story-oriented, you know, have to do, you had to think more instead of just straight on, you know, look and shoot, kill things, you had to kind of more think in a problem-solving way, you know? I don't know if I would put it that high on the list.

1850
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:23,480
I think it's way too high on the list, especially considering the number of other FPSs they have on the list

1851
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:27,480
because there's another one still on the list we haven't gotten to yet.

1852
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:32,480
Number five, this is an interesting choice, but I suppose you have to have a sports game somewhere in the top ten.

1853
02:09:32,480 --> 02:09:34,480
Matt in 2003.

1854
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:39,480
I'm sorry, super high impact football is better.

1855
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:42,480
We're spending way much time on this game, go to the next one.

1856
02:09:42,480 --> 02:09:45,480
None of us play sports games, give me a fucking break.

1857
02:09:45,480 --> 02:09:47,480
Tecmo Bowl. Enough said.

1858
02:09:47,480 --> 02:09:49,480
No, no. Tecmo Bowl and Super High Impact.

1859
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:52,480
NBA Jam, I think is the only one I ate.

1860
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:54,480
NBA Jam 10 seconds earlier.

1861
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:57,480
The only sports game I ever played was NFL Blitz.

1862
02:09:57,480 --> 02:09:59,480
Blitz was actually kind of funny.

1863
02:09:59,480 --> 02:10:00,480
What's that?

1864
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:01,480
Blitz was kind of funny.

1865
02:10:01,480 --> 02:10:03,480
Wait, wait, wait. That's the only reason I played it.

1866
02:10:03,480 --> 02:10:05,480
Super Tennis on Super Nintendo. I did play that.

1867
02:10:05,480 --> 02:10:09,480
Alright, moving on. Here we go.

1868
02:10:09,480 --> 02:10:12,480
Uh, getting down to that wire. Number 4, Grand Theft Auto 3.

1869
02:10:12,480 --> 02:10:17,480
Yeah, that has to be on there. It was pretty unique.

1870
02:10:17,480 --> 02:10:23,480
It's again the series highlighted by one game. And Vice City is just 3's engine, isn't it?

1871
02:10:23,480 --> 02:10:28,480
Vice City is a little bit different. The engine, they upgraded the graphics a bit.

1872
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:34,480
And they changed... I don't know, I guess it is the same engine. Maybe they just...

1873
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:38,480
I don't know. Unlimited some things in the graphics.

1874
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:46,960
number three Tetris I almost think I almost think it ought to be number one

1875
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:53,920
I'll say it I'll say it since you know I'm gonna leave now goodbye so weird

1876
02:10:53,920 --> 02:11:00,760
without that we wouldn't have tetranet I ran I ran something to contribute yes I

1877
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:04,880
kind of think that's why mrs. pac-man was so high on the list because it has

1878
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:08,880
kind of the same appeal as Tetris where you could play it over and over and over

1879
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:12,840
it's different every time you know you don't have to worry about graphics or

1880
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:16,160
anything like that it's something you could take with you to work and play and

1881
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:19,560
you don't have to immerse yourself into a story or anything it's just pick up

1882
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:23,780
and go and it's the same as Tetris you know also if I'm not mistaken out of the

1883
02:11:23,780 --> 02:11:27,120
hundred games on this list this is one of only two puzzle games on the whole

1884
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:35,440
list, Puzzle Fighter II. But how many puzzle games did Tetris influence? Columns? What

1885
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:43,120
was the one I'm thinking of? Besides Puzzle Fighter, there was... But I'm not really disappointed

1886
02:11:43,120 --> 02:11:52,400
with what they put as number one, so... Magical Drop. Alright. Moving on, number two, I promise

1887
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:57,680
there'd be another FPS on here before we got to the end. Doom. Yes, because I would come

1888
02:11:57,680 --> 02:12:06,680
home from school and go back to Marcy's house and we would play Doom all night. And I think

1889
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:14,520
because this game is here, Half-Life should not be on this list at all. Yeah. And I question

1890
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:20,160
Halo's presence. Hold on. Half-Life puts more of a story into it and I think that's why

1891
02:12:20,160 --> 02:12:26,800
they put it there but that does make you question halo being there halo is the

1892
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:30,880
most successful xbox game is what matt says uh matt loki matt

1893
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:34,960
hold on here's the thing i see what they're doing here on this list they're

1894
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:38,000
going by genre it's like they're cycling through genre games and which ones are

1895
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:43,200
the best in the genre we might as well have just a top 20 games in each genre

1896
02:12:43,200 --> 02:12:46,480
that would have been more of a better idea but whatever

1897
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:53,480
Number one, and obviously somebody can guess this because it hasn't been named yet. Let Irene.

1898
02:12:54,120 --> 02:12:55,640
And it is...

1899
02:12:55,640 --> 02:12:57,160
Drum roll, please.

1900
02:12:57,160 --> 02:13:00,120
A boy and his Bob!

1901
02:13:00,120 --> 02:13:01,500
That's my choice, but

1902
02:13:01,500 --> 02:13:05,960
it's The Legend of Zelda. Can you guess which game in the series they chose to highlight?

1903
02:13:05,960 --> 02:13:08,120
The original. No.

1904
02:13:08,120 --> 02:13:14,720
Link to the past. Really? Link to the past. Oh, I thought you told me the original. Nope, you lied. I just heard you tell me the original.

1905
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:15,720
I totally guessed it.

1906
02:13:15,720 --> 02:13:20,720
And I'm okay with Tetris not being number one because Zelda's, you know, God.

1907
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:22,720
Link to the Past was the best of the series.

1908
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:25,720
And I agree, Link to the Past was the best of the series, period.

1909
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:28,720
I think it's better than Ocarina of Time, even, and I think...

1910
02:13:28,720 --> 02:13:31,720
Well, I have to say Ocarina of Time...

1911
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:35,720
Give Ice Queen a mic, please.

1912
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:39,720
I have to say that Ocarina of Time was about equal to the Link of the Past,

1913
02:13:39,720 --> 02:13:43,720
but this new freaking Zelda that's out compared to these other two sucks ass.

1914
02:13:43,720 --> 02:13:49,820
it's good in its own way but not as a Zelda yes I did it's good in its own way

1915
02:13:49,820 --> 02:13:53,260
it's got a good story but you're a freaking treasure hunter the whole

1916
02:13:53,260 --> 02:13:59,020
freaking game you're a goddamn treasure hunter I'm sorry but that is not Zelda

1917
02:13:59,020 --> 02:14:02,740
you have to get all the pieces of the thing so you can get through dungeons

1918
02:14:02,740 --> 02:14:07,360
let's make sure we keep it spoiler free it's actually a direct sequel to

1919
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:12,060
spoiler I know just just a reminder spoiler it's a direct it's a direct

1920
02:14:12,060 --> 02:14:13,860
sequel to Ocarina of Time.

1921
02:14:13,860 --> 02:14:17,580
Well, that was Mask of Majora, wasn't it? No, that's sort of the alternate universe.

1922
02:14:17,580 --> 02:14:22,860
Oh, and Mask of Majora is just... It was shit. It was shit.

1923
02:14:22,860 --> 02:14:26,260
I think I probably had the most fun playing out of all the Zeldas.

1924
02:14:26,260 --> 02:14:27,680
Probably playing the, uh,

1925
02:14:27,680 --> 02:14:29,900
oracle games on Game Boy.

1926
02:14:29,900 --> 02:14:32,340
No, I'm sad about the whole, you know,

1927
02:14:32,340 --> 02:14:34,300
the way they did this Legend of Zelda.

1928
02:14:34,300 --> 02:14:36,020
Imagine, you know,

1929
02:14:36,020 --> 02:14:39,380
Legends I'll link to the past storyline with the graphics

1930
02:14:39,380 --> 02:14:40,740
of Wind Waker.

1931
02:14:40,740 --> 02:14:45,740
That's what I was imagining that I wanted out of this game.

1932
02:14:45,740 --> 02:14:50,180
Well, there's still time for them to make a new one that's like that.

1933
02:14:50,180 --> 02:14:54,260
They were going in kind of a different direction as to the way the gameplay flows and everything in this one.

1934
02:14:54,260 --> 02:14:58,660
They wanted to go for more of an anime-style drama-type story.

1935
02:14:58,660 --> 02:15:02,140
And I really, really like this one, and it probably is my favorite of the...

1936
02:15:02,140 --> 02:15:06,540
It is my favorite of the 3D Zeldas, but...

1937
02:15:06,540 --> 02:15:09,580
Different type of game, in my opinion.

1938
02:15:09,580 --> 02:15:16,580
The biggest problem, and this isn't going to be a spoiler, it might be a little bit, but the biggest problem is the fact that there are so few dungeons.

1939
02:15:16,580 --> 02:15:21,580
That's the thing that killed this Zelda for me. There's no dungeons!

1940
02:15:21,580 --> 02:15:27,580
Yeah, that's great, but I spent like three hours in one of the dungeons once, so I don't care if there's four, five, six dungeons.

1941
02:15:27,580 --> 02:15:31,580
I mean, that was a long time to spend in one dungeon. You know what though?

1942
02:15:31,580 --> 02:15:35,580
In Ocarina of Time, if you don't know what you're doing, you could easily spend three or four hours in a dungeon.

1943
02:15:35,580 --> 02:15:39,940
and you had all of those that well yeah the water one especially but because of

1944
02:15:39,940 --> 02:15:43,620
that freaking tricky little I can see that a little bit because I get really

1945
02:15:43,620 --> 02:15:49,140
aggravated by those fucking by those fucking caves and PSO my god you spend

1946
02:15:49,140 --> 02:15:53,420
like five hours in those freaking caves it's like chains of scenery please Oh

1947
02:15:53,420 --> 02:15:57,420
fantasy star online yeah yeah I don't know all right so let's wrap up this

1948
02:15:57,420 --> 02:16:00,220
because we kind of did this for a long time this is interesting this is

1949
02:16:00,220 --> 02:16:05,500
interesting yes any yeah sure those of you us that were here for all 100

1950
02:16:05,500 --> 02:16:10,860
games want to say anything they think was left off should have been on there

1951
02:16:12,460 --> 02:16:21,180
bionic commando yes blaster master no mention of the Megaman series at all the

1952

1953
02:16:26,340 --> 02:16:29,940
top what is up with that I treasure was not on the list

1954
02:16:29,940 --> 02:16:34,180
chrono trigger being so low is another one of my bitches yeah that's sad um

1955
02:16:34,180 --> 02:16:36,180
Um, was Boinus Bomb on there?

1956
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:36,680
No.

1957
02:16:36,680 --> 02:16:37,180
What?

1958
02:16:37,180 --> 02:16:38,180
Kill them now.

1959
02:16:38,180 --> 02:16:40,180
What about...

1960
02:16:40,180 --> 02:16:43,180
And we could ragdrock online, why was that not on there?

1961
02:16:43,180 --> 02:16:44,180
Dance X Revolution was 40.

1962
02:16:44,180 --> 02:16:46,180
Really? Wow.

1963
02:16:46,180 --> 02:16:48,180
Dance X Revolution was higher than Chrono Trigger.

1964
02:16:48,180 --> 02:16:53,180
That's, that is, that's a travesty. I'm never gonna watch G4.

1965
02:16:53,180 --> 02:16:54,180
I'm gonna bomb them.

1966
02:16:54,180 --> 02:16:58,180
Fantasy Star was on the list, actually. Somebody's pitching about Fantasy Star.

1967
02:16:58,180 --> 02:17:03,180
Fantasy Star was, uh, I might have skipped over it. It was in the beginning. Sorry kids, it was 76.

1968
02:17:03,180 --> 02:17:06,680
What the hell kind of crack addict loser printed up that list?

1969
02:17:06,680 --> 02:17:09,680
They put Chrono Trigger underneath the money?

1970
02:17:09,680 --> 02:17:13,180
G4 TV and Entertainment Weekly, you can address those cards.

1971
02:17:13,180 --> 02:17:15,680
Yeah, you people from those companies, you're losers.

1972
02:17:15,680 --> 02:17:18,680
You don't know what the hell you're talking about and you should try playing video games.

1973
02:17:18,680 --> 02:17:20,680
I know, hold on, Entertainment Weekly?

1974
02:17:20,680 --> 02:17:24,180
They don't even know what a video game is, so why are they doing a list like this?

1975
02:17:24,180 --> 02:17:25,680
Why they partner with G4?

1976
02:17:25,680 --> 02:17:29,680
But G4 doesn't even know what a video game is, apparently, you know?

1977
02:17:29,680 --> 02:17:32,680
The whole entire Puyo Puyo series.

1978
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:36,520
I mean, I just didn't play Tetris on there, but Pio Pio played so differently.

1979
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:43,800
I mean, I played, you know, Kirby's Avalanche, and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.

1980
02:17:43,800 --> 02:17:46,080
And where was Sonic Adventure?

1981
02:17:46,080 --> 02:17:47,080
Not there.

1982
02:17:47,080 --> 02:17:48,080
That was so different.

1983
02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:49,080
Sonic was lower than it should have been.

1984
02:17:49,080 --> 02:17:50,960
A very, very good mention.

1985
02:17:50,960 --> 02:17:54,640
Multiple people in the chat room were saying this, Earthbound.

1986
02:17:54,640 --> 02:17:55,640
Yeah.

1987
02:17:55,640 --> 02:17:57,800
It should have been a mention.

1988
02:17:57,800 --> 02:18:00,440
I can see why it would not be in the top 50 even.

1989
02:18:00,440 --> 02:18:01,880
Because nobody knows about it.

1990
02:18:01,880 --> 02:18:06,280
I disagree, it's one of the hugest cult video games out there.

1991
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:09,240
But it's a cult video game.

1992
02:18:09,240 --> 02:18:13,880
We're obviously going for games that people know about, and I never even heard about Earthbound until I met you.

1993
02:18:13,880 --> 02:18:19,880
I think the fact that it's one of the biggest cult games of all time ought to put it on there.

1994
02:18:19,880 --> 02:18:24,640
And people will know Earthbound soon because it's coming out on Game Boy Advance.

1995
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:26,000
Mother?

1996
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,240
Alright.

1997
02:18:27,240 --> 02:18:29,000

2008
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:55,520
over the top one hundred one one

2009
02:18:55,520 --> 02:18:57,820
Do you want to hear my opinion about what game should have been number one?

2010
02:18:57,820 --> 02:18:59,520
No you don't, but I'm going to say anyway.

2011
02:18:59,520 --> 02:19:00,020
What?

2012
02:19:00,020 --> 02:19:02,020
civilian night of course.

2013
02:19:02,020 --> 02:19:02,520
Alright.

2014
02:19:02,520 --> 02:19:04,520
The Japanese version with the better voice typing.

2015
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:06,520
The Saturn version.

2016
02:19:06,520 --> 02:19:09,520
We're running a little low on time so I'm going to kick us over to break.

2017
02:19:09,520 --> 02:19:10,020
Okay.

2018
02:19:10,020 --> 02:19:13,520
So we've done 7th style music, 8th style music, and 9th style music.

2019
02:19:13,520 --> 02:19:15,520
So let's do some 6th style music.

2020
02:19:15,520 --> 02:19:17,020
Did we ever announce the cage match winner?

2021
02:19:17,020 --> 02:19:18,020
No we didn't.

2022
02:19:18,020 --> 02:19:19,520
You want to announce the cage match winner?

2023
02:19:19,520 --> 02:19:21,020
Fucking Matt.

2024
02:19:21,020 --> 02:19:23,520
Yeah, it's Mona Lisa overdrive again. Hooray.

2025
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:27,520
Yeah, but you can't win again.

2026
02:19:27,520 --> 02:19:32,520
First time a song has been in for four weeks.

2027
02:19:32,520 --> 02:19:35,520
By the way, another landslide vote for that one.

2028
02:19:35,520 --> 02:19:40,520
So, good job for Mona Lisa Overdrive.

2029
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:43,520
Alright, so Mona Lisa Overdrive wins.

2030
02:19:43,520 --> 02:19:45,520
Okay, so we're going to do some six-style songs.

2031
02:19:45,520 --> 02:19:52,520
And when we come back, Jamie, is there a six-style song you want to hear?

2032
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:54,020
So we're out of my mind, right?

2033
02:19:54,020 --> 02:19:54,520
Sure.

2034
02:19:54,520 --> 02:19:55,020
OK.

2035
02:19:55,020 --> 02:19:55,600
It's depressing.

2036
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:56,280
It's goth.

2037
02:19:56,280 --> 02:19:58,960
And we're just going to do two six style songs.

2038
02:19:58,960 --> 02:20:02,400
We need to come back and do the FUs of the week because we

2039
02:20:02,400 --> 02:20:03,360
haven't done those yet.

2040
02:20:03,360 --> 02:20:04,120
Surprise, surprise.

2041
02:20:04,120 --> 02:20:07,000
So hurry up and send those to me over private message in

2042
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:07,440
the chat room.

2043
02:20:07,440 --> 02:20:08,200
My name is Sky.

2044
02:20:08,200 --> 02:20:09,480
We've got to keep it short this week.

2045
02:20:09,480 --> 02:20:12,840
Please keep your FUs of the week short, chat room.

2046
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:14,840
All right, we'll be back in a little bit.

2047
02:22:12,840 --> 02:22:41,840
Come walk inside of me, trapped in a ocean

2048
02:22:41,840 --> 02:22:45,840
Where am I going to?

2049
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:52,840
I need to leave, I need to let go

2050
02:22:52,840 --> 02:23:00,840
Of all the friends and thoughts inside my mind

2051
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:04,840
From all the changes I've

2052
02:23:04,840 --> 02:23:10,840
How could I find my way to you?

2053
02:23:10,840 --> 02:23:13,840
So give me a chance to know

2054
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:19,840
I've seen you reaching for my hand

2055
02:23:19,840 --> 02:23:25,840
Follow the leading secrets of my heart

2056
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:34,840
Oh, it's me, DJ, everywhere on my mind

2057
02:23:34,840 --> 02:23:38,840
Now I'm the giant

2058
02:23:38,840 --> 02:23:57,840
How could I find my way to you?

2059
02:23:57,840 --> 02:24:01,280
You can't remember me

2060
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:09,040
You can't remember my love

2061
02:24:19,440 --> 02:24:23,360
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

2062
02:24:23,360 --> 02:24:51,360
It's time to start the FUs of the Week!

2063
02:24:53,360 --> 02:25:02,360
Ooh! Every time I listen to this, I still get, like, happy.

2064
02:25:02,360 --> 02:25:09,360
Um, if I could at least go to an idiot driver, she'd nearly run over me.

2065
02:25:09,360 --> 02:25:14,360
Go to the entire parking lot at Arden Fair Mall, because I nearly got hit a bunch of times.

2066
02:25:14,360 --> 02:25:19,360
And then, you know, it also goes toward, you know, just being nervous in general.

2067
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:23,360
And then it goes toward being exhausted and not being able to sleep.

2068
02:25:23,360 --> 02:25:32,360
And then it goes toward the person on Ragnarok Online who kept casting the ice spell and blocking all the paths and lagging me.

2069
02:25:32,360 --> 02:25:35,360
So, other than that I'm not really all that anxious to you.

2070
02:25:35,360 --> 02:25:38,360
I'm very happy because I'm going to have a new live journal.

2071
02:25:38,360 --> 02:25:39,360
A pretty new live journal layout.

2072
02:25:39,360 --> 02:25:41,360
It is very pretty, I've seen it.

2073
02:25:41,360 --> 02:25:43,360
And it's very transformery.

2074
02:25:43,360 --> 02:25:45,360
And I know another one.

2075
02:25:45,360 --> 02:25:50,360
Another Fuck You goes toward all of those dubbed Headmasters episodes.

2076
02:25:50,360 --> 02:25:56,360
When I'm trying to find Japanese episodes, or, you know, raw ones, or ones that are subtitled,

2077
02:25:56,360 --> 02:26:01,360
instead I'm finding either the crappy three episodes they did in the States, which I already own,

2078
02:26:01,360 --> 02:26:08,360
or, like, those bad dubs that they did. Horrible dubs of Headmasters.

2079
02:26:08,360 --> 02:26:10,360
Jap- It's Transformers.

2080
02:26:11,360 --> 02:26:12,360
Boo.

2081
02:26:13,360 --> 02:26:15,360
So that pisses me off.

2082
02:26:15,360 --> 02:26:20,360
And another one goes toward me not being able to find another hot rod so I can have it at work.

2083
02:26:20,360 --> 02:26:22,360
And that's it.

2084
02:26:24,360 --> 02:26:25,360
Alright.

2085
02:26:25,360 --> 02:26:27,360
Looooookey.

2086
02:26:28,360 --> 02:26:29,360
Okay, um...

2087
02:26:29,360 --> 02:26:31,360
FU2, uh...

2088
02:26:32,360 --> 02:26:34,360
Oh, what was it? Only had two. Oh yeah.

2089
02:26:34,360 --> 02:26:37,360
Um, FU2 is a stupid bitch that sent me my records.

2090
02:26:37,360 --> 02:26:44,360
First off, Culture Club, I'm sorry it doesn't work in two halves. Not at all.

2091
02:26:44,360 --> 02:26:47,360
So, um, you don't know how to pack shit at all.

2092
02:26:47,360 --> 02:26:50,360
So I emailed her back because my records came all broken.

2093
02:26:50,360 --> 02:26:58,360
It's like, oh, I guess I should have done something other than just pat them in bubble wrap and write fragile.

2094
02:26:58,360 --> 02:27:04,360
So I can't get my money back from her, but I'm going to give her one hell of negative feedback on eBay.

2095
02:27:04,360 --> 02:27:11,360
But yeah, that wasted $15, plus the fact that I was overdrawn twice, so my bank charged me $60 for those records.

2096
02:27:11,360 --> 02:27:15,360
So I was at a loss of $75 total for $15 for the record.

2097
02:27:17,360 --> 02:27:22,360
Yeah, at least my Eggy Murphy record works. I had to bend it back.

2098
02:27:22,360 --> 02:27:25,360
Yeah, so that's the one I wanted anyways.

2099
02:27:25,360 --> 02:27:33,360
And then finally, in world news, Fv2's a dumb, I don't know what nationality you are, but Middle Eastern bitch that's bitchy in Florida.

2100
02:27:33,360 --> 02:27:38,080
about the fact that you have to remove your veil to take a driver's license photo.

2101
02:27:38,080 --> 02:27:40,000
Listen bitch, you look like a fucking ninja.

2102
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:43,360
You need to like take the damn veil off or just quit driving.

2103
02:27:43,360 --> 02:27:43,920
I better get.

2104
02:27:43,920 --> 02:27:47,840
Why don't you just support your ass over to, you know, the Middle East where you belong.

2105
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:49,360
So, uh, yeah, I'm sorry.

2106
02:27:49,360 --> 02:27:53,680
I don't, I want to sound like some kind of like fascist or American or something,

2107
02:27:53,680 --> 02:27:57,120
but if you're going to live in our country, you kind of have to follow our rules and laws.

2108
02:27:57,120 --> 02:27:58,000
And that is a law.

2109
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:02,800
You have to take your hat off to take a driver's license.

2110
02:28:02,800 --> 02:28:06,800
If you don't, you don't get to drive in the country, and that's, that's the way it is, I'm sorry.

2111
02:28:06,800 --> 02:28:14,800
She looks like frickin', um, what's it, that stupid floating wizard guy from, um, Orko. She looks like Orko, okay?

2112
02:28:14,800 --> 02:28:20,800
I, I, I just have, um, three words, four words, separation of church and state.

2113
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:24,800
I'm done. That's all I had. I'm not that anxious because of the lyrics.

2114
02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:30,800
I'll fuck you by the lyrics. I don't know what you meant by that, but okay.

2115
02:28:30,800 --> 02:28:35,800
My F.U. of the week goes to my SARS, my never-ending case of SARS, and my brain tumor.

2116
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:38,800
Fuck you, Irene. My other F.U. goes to Irene.

2117
02:28:39,800 --> 02:28:45,800
And my next F.U. goes to the fact that I had, what, something like five, six drinks, and I was drunk for maybe, like, two minutes.

2118
02:28:46,800 --> 02:28:48,800
At the most. Sucked.

2119
02:28:51,800 --> 02:28:57,800
It may have seemed like two minutes to you, but I remember you and, like, Matt and Irene frickin' jumpin' around, being all silly.

2120
02:28:57,800 --> 02:29:08,800
I was probably more like an hour. Yeah, Irene, like, tripped. She said she tripped, but it looks to me like she just did a Superman fly dive thing towards the emergency exit. It was really interesting.

2121
02:29:09,800 --> 02:29:13,800
Alright, let's move on to other folks in the room, FUs of the Week.

2122
02:29:14,800 --> 02:29:16,800
Uh, Brad?

2123
02:29:17,800 --> 02:29:20,800
FU goes to this segment because I really don't like it.

2124
02:29:21,800 --> 02:29:22,800
Uh, Irene?

2125
02:29:23,800 --> 02:29:24,800
FUs of the Week.

2126
02:29:25,800 --> 02:29:26,800
Brad, come on.

2127
02:29:26,800 --> 02:29:40,800
My FUs two weird toe guys that are like freaking scary that come to help you at like 3 o'clock in the morning and just say yeah doesn't anybody ever sleep in this chair out and fuck you dude.

2128
02:29:40,800 --> 02:29:49,800
That's part of my idea I forgot about. I was driving home after dropping a rob and a madoff at rob's place.

2129
02:29:49,800 --> 02:29:54,800
I was driving around and my tire went flat and my CD half shaft in the front right of my car blew out.

2130
02:29:54,800 --> 02:29:58,800
So that's a couple hundred dollars of work I've got to do on my car.

2131
02:29:58,800 --> 02:30:06,800
Fuck you do automobiles. Shitty ones made in America or Japan or Korea or German or whatever. I don't care.

2132
02:30:06,800 --> 02:30:11,420
Yugoslavia it doesn't matter all cars stuck in some way or another came he has another one play my music

2133
02:30:13,840 --> 02:30:16,920
There okay, I can't hear it, but anyway um

2134
02:30:18,320 --> 02:30:22,240
My allergies fuck them because now my chest hurts

2135
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:27,960
and I feel like I have SARS and I actually feel sick is the thing I feel sick and

2136
02:30:28,480 --> 02:30:32,800
Like and like fuck it not having access to my PTO until another two months

2137
02:30:32,800 --> 02:30:38,080
because I would so just stay home and like cough up all my lungs and then feel

2138
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:48,400
better my insurance kicks in today okay that it yeah yeah look at that ice queen

princess don't be very much come on the ice princess and I'm only an instant

2141
02:31:01,280 --> 02:31:08,040
But when I have alcohol so there and yeah, if I see my allergies to and the fact that Claritin is like freaking $12 for 10 pills

2142
02:31:08,720 --> 02:31:11,840
It works really well, but it's $12 for 10 tablets

2143
02:31:12,520 --> 02:31:17,080
It's overpriced. It works. Well, it's overpriced and it makes me really dehydrated

2144
02:31:18,300 --> 02:31:19,480
Yeah

2145
02:31:19,480 --> 02:31:24,120
But other than that my only fuck you goes to those people who say that you have to have a job to be happy

2146
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:28,360
Because I don't have a job right now and I'm really really happy. I like it

2147
02:31:28,360 --> 02:31:32,360
Well, yeah, but that's not going to be an issue for much longer.

2148
02:31:32,360 --> 02:31:33,360
I have a pseudo job.

2149
02:31:33,360 --> 02:31:38,360
I can work when I want, however many times I want, doing whatever I want, and it pays

2150
02:31:38,360 --> 02:31:39,360
pretty well, so yeah.

2151
02:31:39,360 --> 02:31:40,360
He's a whore.

2152
02:31:40,360 --> 02:31:41,360
That's right.

2153
02:31:41,360 --> 02:31:42,360
All right.

2154
02:31:42,360 --> 02:31:47,360
Let's move on to the chat room FUs.

2155
02:31:47,360 --> 02:31:51,360

Theazhp would like to say F you to...

2176
02:33:24,420 --> 02:33:26,220
StarFox was not on the list.

2177
02:33:26,220 --> 02:33:27,320
It was not. You're correct.

2178
02:33:27,320 --> 02:33:28,320
Damn them. Okay, sorry.

2179
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:30,020

Irene was talking about you, Ralph.

2186
02:33:57,420 --> 02:33:58,420
Shut up.

2187
02:33:58,420 --> 02:34:06,420
Angel would like to give an F U to obnoxious, egotistical, seniority-slinging co-workers who get paid for nothing else than to boss people around and make them feel like shit.

2188
02:34:06,420 --> 02:34:08,420
Yeah, management.

2189
02:34:08,420 --> 02:34:10,420
There's not question mark on the typo, oops.

2190
02:34:10,420 --> 02:34:13,420
Quick your job, it feels really, really, really good. I promise.

2191
02:34:13,420 --> 02:34:14,420
Now you're out of money.

2192
02:34:15,420 --> 02:34:23,420
Justin would like to say F you to myself because I got into Ragnarok just as the servers came back, but I DC'd and tried to reconnect and it didn't let me.

2193
02:34:23,420 --> 02:34:27,420
Oh well, I will have it by Wednesday. I will be there soon, Jamie.

2194
02:34:27,420 --> 02:34:31,420
And Skye, play this song. The window. People need to be scared. I have no time.

2195

Also, F you to me puking nine times on Wednesday. F you to my sickness.

2196
02:34:35,420 --> 02:34:37,420
You have SARS. Haha.

2197
02:34:37,420 --> 02:34:44,420
That's it for the FUs! Yay!

2198
02:34:44,420 --> 02:35:05,420
Once again, and you only have three hours left, you will go instantly, right now, not waiting one second, and go vote for The Legend of Trance on BomaniStyle, and you will vote a ten, and you will like it. That is all.

2199
02:35:05,420 --> 02:35:12,420
And that would be the remix contest. Yes, you want them to vote The Legend of Trance and Dark Black Forest, both tens.

2200
02:35:12,420 --> 02:35:14,420
That is correct.

2201
02:35:14,420 --> 02:35:17,420
Where are you?

2202
02:35:17,420 --> 02:35:19,420
Yeah, what are you ranked right now?

2203
02:35:19,420 --> 02:35:21,420
I think I'm like fifth.

2204
02:35:21,420 --> 02:35:23,420
Unacceptable!

2205
02:35:23,420 --> 02:35:28,420
I still get a CD.

2206
02:35:28,420 --> 02:35:34,540
Also other things that you can do you can vote our station of five in your life 365 player window because we love the ratings

2207
02:35:34,540 --> 02:35:36,540
and you can also

2208
02:35:36,940 --> 02:35:39,500
Whore out our listening hours by listening to us all day long

2209
02:35:43,740 --> 02:35:48,220
Okay, all right, so let's do the orange crush thingy, all right, we're gonna do orange crush

2210
02:35:48,220 --> 02:35:54,500
Hey, let me go first so I can go the bathroom. Are you ready for orange crush? Irene? Okay, here we go. I'm very ready

2211
02:35:54,500 --> 02:36:04,500
Now, it's time for Orange Crush. It's time to ask questions during Orange Crush. Yay!

2212
02:36:04,500 --> 02:36:11,760
I love the theme song. It's cool. Okay. Everyone's leaving. Everyone's leaving. I don't want

2213
02:36:11,760 --> 02:36:16,900

2215
02:36:23,260 --> 02:36:24,260
Irene's favorite.

2216
02:36:24,260 --> 02:36:27,260
Yeah, these are questions about Osamu Kubota.

2217
02:36:27,260 --> 02:36:28,260
Alright.

2218
02:36:28,260 --> 02:36:30,260
Yeah, and then Matt's like, oh fuck, I'm screwed.

2219
02:36:30,260 --> 02:36:31,260
But um, okay.

2220
02:36:31,260 --> 02:36:33,260
So, does anyone have a timer for 30 seconds?

2221
02:36:33,260 --> 02:36:34,260
I do.

2222
02:36:34,260 --> 02:36:35,260
I'll time it.

2223
02:36:35,260 --> 02:36:36,260
Okay, super.

2224
02:36:36,260 --> 02:36:37,260
Here we go.

2225
02:36:37,260 --> 02:36:38,260
Okay, so we'll, huh?

2226
02:36:38,260 --> 02:36:39,260
Yeah, turn it down.

2227
02:36:39,260 --> 02:36:40,260
Yeah.

2228
02:36:40,260 --> 02:36:41,260
Oh, here, I'll turn it down.

2229
02:36:41,260 --> 02:36:42,260
Yeah.

02:36:42,260 --> 02:36:43,260
Turn it down.

2231
02:36:43,260 --> 02:36:44,260
Okay, so.

02:36:44,260 --> 02:36:45,260
No, you're fine.

2233
02:36:45,260 --> 02:36:46,260
We're fine.

2234
02:36:46,260 --> 02:36:47,260
I just turned out the in-studio sound completely.

2235
02:36:47,260 --> 02:36:48,260
Okay.

2236
02:36:48,260 --> 02:36:49,260
Okay.

02:36:51,260 --> 02:36:52,260
Okay, in three, two, one.

2241
02:37:06,420 --> 02:37:22,180
What taxon was Osamu Kaboda consulted on? What are his two main hobbies? Playing games

2242
02:37:22,180 --> 02:37:32,080

2246
02:37:47,920 --> 02:38:08,240
Let's do some more Orange Crush, it's time to crush the Orange Crush, we're in an intermission

2247
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:15,200
Let me ask, do people like Orange Crush?

2248
02:38:15,200 --> 02:38:17,720
Is this going to be a regular segment?

2249
02:38:17,720 --> 02:38:20,000
Are the people in the chat room digging it?

2250
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:23,360
Because I've got a lot of material.

2251
02:38:23,360 --> 02:38:24,840
I think they like it.

2252
02:38:24,840 --> 02:38:25,840
They like you, Irene.

2253
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:26,840
They really like you.

2254
02:38:26,840 --> 02:38:27,840
Aww.

2255
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:28,840
Thanks.

2256
02:38:28,840 --> 02:38:29,840
You love me.

2257
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:30,840
You really love me.

2258
02:38:30,840 --> 02:38:31,840
Can I hand the mic over to Brad?

2259
02:38:31,840 --> 02:38:32,840
Okay, hold on.

2260
02:38:32,840 --> 02:38:37,120
He has an idea and I'm scared.

2261
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:41,960
It looks like with the nature of these questions and stuff, and obviously the lack of knowledge

2262
02:38:41,960 --> 02:38:46,520
that our contestants have on these questions, we might should be able to change the length

2263
02:38:46,520 --> 02:38:51,280
of the time, or whatever, to 45 seconds, because, eh.

2264
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:52,280
But not now.

2265
02:38:52,280 --> 02:38:53,280
That's a good suggestion for the future.

2266
02:38:53,280 --> 02:38:54,280
Not now.

2267
02:38:54,280 --> 02:38:55,280
Yeah.

2268
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:58,920
That's production notes, but I'm allowed to give that out since we're sitting here waiting

2269
02:38:58,920 --> 02:38:59,920
forever.

2270
02:38:59,920 --> 02:39:00,920
Yeah.

2271
02:39:00,920 --> 02:39:03,640
And you know, what else am I thinking in regards to Orange Crash?

2272
02:39:03,640 --> 02:39:06,360
I want to do Orange Jeopardy one week on the show.

2273
02:39:06,360 --> 02:39:10,680
If you thought that G4 thing took forever on the show, I want to do Orange Jeopardy.

2274
02:39:10,680 --> 02:39:12,800
Can I give a hint about another Orange Crush?

2275
02:39:12,800 --> 02:39:17,280
Another thing I don't like about it, it's like you're giving specific categories about

2276
02:39:17,280 --> 02:39:20,640
like certain people and stuff that have no friggin' clue about what the hell's going

2277
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:21,640
on.

2278
02:39:21,640 --> 02:39:22,640
It needs to be multiple-

2279
02:39:22,640 --> 02:39:23,640
Hold on, hold on.

2280
02:39:23,640 --> 02:39:24,640
Multiple choice?

2281
02:39:24,640 --> 02:39:27,760
No, it needs to either be multiple choice or it needs to be like something else.

2282
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:28,760
That's a good idea.

2283
02:39:28,760 --> 02:39:30,240
Maybe we should try multiple choice sometime.

2284
02:39:30,240 --> 02:39:31,240
Because I don't-

2285
02:39:31,240 --> 02:39:32,240
But the reason why-

2286
02:39:32,240 --> 02:39:33,240
I don't know nor care.

2287
02:39:33,240 --> 02:39:34,280
Here's the thing, Matt, Matt.

2288
02:39:34,280 --> 02:39:38,440
We understand that people aren't going to know a lot of the answers to these questions.

2289
02:39:38,440 --> 02:39:40,880
That's kind of why we're doing it, because it's kind of like a knowledge thing.

2290
02:39:40,880 --> 02:39:45,240
We're teaching people out there who might want to watch.

2291
02:39:45,240 --> 02:39:49,920
Some people are fanatics about some of the artists, and so they like to know, and they

2292
02:39:49,920 --> 02:39:52,400
like to hear these things, like birth dates of the artists.

2293
02:39:52,400 --> 02:39:53,400
I think.

2294
02:39:53,400 --> 02:39:54,400
Okay, time to go.

2295
02:39:54,400 --> 02:39:55,400
All right, here we go.

2296
02:39:55,400 --> 02:39:58,000
Are you going to fill Jamie in on what tonight?

2297
02:39:58,000 --> 02:39:59,000
Oh, hi.

2298
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
Fill me what?

2299
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:02,000
Fill Jamie up.

2300
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:03,000
Okay.

2301
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:09,580
Okay, the theme of tonight, Jamie, is called foreplay, and these are questions about Osama

2302
02:40:09,580 --> 02:40:15,320
Koboda. Whichever his website. You did? Then you should know. I'll probably get them wrong

2303
02:40:15,320 --> 02:40:20,960
because I don't remember. It's okay. So do you have the time set? Yes. Okay. Three, two,

2304
02:40:20,960 --> 02:40:27,960
one, go. What year was he born? Seventy-four. What's his blood type? A. Okay. What tax song

2305
02:40:27,960 --> 02:40:39,600
type? A. What tax song was Osamu Kaboda consulted on? Era. What's his two main hobbies? French

2306
02:40:39,600 --> 02:40:46,360
and music. What is the name of his production house? I don't remember. Ok, that's all of

2307
02:40:46,360 --> 02:40:55,480
them. Kaboda productions? No, both of you got none of them right. Ok, yeah. He was back

2308
02:40:55,480 --> 02:41:03,200
1965. Okay. Yeah. He was born in 1965. I'll relay. I'll relay. You ask the questions.

2309
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:08,680
I'll relay the answers. Okay. What's his blood type? I'm going to say O. No, it's A.B.

2310
02:41:08,680 --> 02:41:16,560
I almost said A.B. Yeah. You were close. Okay. But it's A.B. Yeah. Okay. What tack song was

2311
02:41:16,560 --> 02:41:22,280
Osamu Okubota consulted on? I know this one. Still My Words. Yeah. He did the piano part

2312
02:41:22,280 --> 02:41:28,000
for still my words. What are his two main hobbies? Cooking and traveling, right? That's

2313
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:37,000
correct. What is the name of his... Here's Men and Women, Matt. That's his two hobbies.

2314
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:42,120
Maybe. I mean, if you take a look at him, he's kind of a mixture of the two. Yeah, okay.

2315
02:41:42,120 --> 02:41:45,960
And what is the name of his production house? This is really interesting. This is very interesting,

2316
02:41:45,960 --> 02:41:48,960
Hey guys, listen. Rob?

2317
02:41:48,960 --> 02:41:49,960
Okay.

2318
02:41:49,960 --> 02:41:51,960
What is the name of his production house?

2319
02:41:51,960 --> 02:41:52,960
Good Cool.

2320
02:41:52,960 --> 02:41:54,960
Yeah, that's the name of his production house.

2321
02:41:54,960 --> 02:41:55,960
Now, think about that for a second.

2322
02:41:55,960 --> 02:41:57,960
Now we know who Good Cool is.

2323
02:41:57,960 --> 02:42:00,960
Well, maybe. It's kind of interesting to me.

2324
02:42:00,960 --> 02:42:05,960
And I've heard rumors something about Tack having something to do with Good Cool.

2325
02:42:05,960 --> 02:42:08,960
Yeah, well they're really good friends.

2326
02:42:08,960 --> 02:42:12,960
But I mean, if you think about it, I can kind of see some similarities to the style of music.

2327
02:42:12,960 --> 02:42:16,160
I mean, it's a different style of music that Good Cool puts out, but the sounds...

2328
02:42:16,160 --> 02:42:17,160
Yeah.

2329
02:42:17,160 --> 02:42:19,680
Uh, Selma and Kubota performed era with Tack?

2330
02:42:19,680 --> 02:42:20,680
Oh.

2331
02:42:20,680 --> 02:42:21,680
That's right.

2332
02:42:21,680 --> 02:42:25,760
Jamie played, like, I remember, it was way, oh my god, it was many episodes ago, but you

2333
02:42:25,760 --> 02:42:26,760
brought...

2334
02:42:26,760 --> 02:42:27,760
Tack and Kubota Live.

2335
02:42:27,760 --> 02:42:28,760
Yeah, it was Tack and Kubota Live.

2336
02:42:28,760 --> 02:42:29,760
Hm.

2337
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:30,760
That's cool.

2338
02:42:30,760 --> 02:42:31,760
That's cool.

2339
02:42:31,760 --> 02:42:32,760
Yeah.

2340
02:42:32,760 --> 02:42:33,760
Anyway.

2341
02:42:33,760 --> 02:42:34,760
But yeah, so, yeah.

2342
02:42:34,760 --> 02:42:35,760
There you go.

2343
02:42:35,760 --> 02:42:39,800
I was gonna ask how tall he was, but that's kind of a boring question, but he's 5'8".

2344
02:42:39,800 --> 02:42:40,800
He's Japanese, let me short.

2345
02:42:40,800 --> 02:42:41,800
I'm almost the same.

2346
02:42:41,800 --> 02:42:46,360
more interesting than the blood type question but you know well okay what's

2347
02:42:46,360 --> 02:42:51,120
that yeah he is fluent in French and English yeah but the blood typing is

2348
02:42:51,120 --> 02:42:57,480
that's a common thing like a Japanese thing Japanese really care about I know

2349
02:42:57,480 --> 02:43:01,840
I know so that's an interesting fact I mean that's something that is not going

2350
02:43:01,840 --> 02:43:05,040
to be on everyone else's yeah when you go to Japan you don't ask girls what

2351
02:43:05,040 --> 02:43:08,200
you're with your sign you say what's your blood type oh and who signs Gemini

2352
02:43:08,200 --> 02:43:10,200
because he was born in June. Yeah, anyway.

2353
02:43:10,200 --> 02:43:12,200
Mmm, tasty.

2354
02:43:12,200 --> 02:43:16,200
That's it with your blood type. Mmm, tasty.

2355
02:43:16,200 --> 02:43:21,200
Well you know, I was born in June and I'm a cancer.

2356
02:43:21,200 --> 02:43:23,200
Yeah, well you are a cancer.

2357
02:43:23,200 --> 02:43:25,200
I'm a cancer on society.

2358
02:43:25,200 --> 02:43:31,200
Yes, exactly. So that concludes another episode of Orange Crush.

2359
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:35,200
This is the end of Orange Crush.

2360
02:43:35,200 --> 02:43:38,600
We need to like make a real song for it or something.

2361
02:43:38,600 --> 02:43:39,600
One of these days.

2362
02:43:39,600 --> 02:43:40,600
One of these days.

2363
02:43:40,600 --> 02:43:41,600
I love your version, Rob.

2364
02:43:41,600 --> 02:43:42,600
Thank you.

2365
02:43:42,600 --> 02:43:43,600
Thank you.

2366
02:43:43,600 --> 02:43:44,600
I appreciate that.

2367
02:43:44,600 --> 02:43:45,600
You're welcome.

2368
02:43:45,600 --> 02:43:46,600
So now we have a little time to kill.

2369
02:43:46,600 --> 02:43:47,920
Shit, we could have done listless.

2370
02:43:47,920 --> 02:43:49,600
Actually, no, because we would have had to rush through it.

2371
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:52,600
So we're kind of stuck with a little bit of time here.

2372
02:43:52,600 --> 02:43:53,600
We're stuck with Rob.

2373
02:43:53,600 --> 02:43:55,800
Can you talk about something we talked about?

2374
02:43:55,800 --> 02:44:02,640
I can talk about something about that list of, or we were talking about what game people

2375
02:44:02,640 --> 02:44:04,760
would like to see a sequel to, a Final Fantasy game.

2376
02:44:04,760 --> 02:44:07,760
I was thinking about this while I was having a cigarette.

2377
02:44:07,760 --> 02:44:12,160
Matt says Final Fantasy 3, I'm going to go around and see who thinks

2378
02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:13,720
what should be done.

2379
02:44:13,720 --> 02:44:18,400
So Rob, what Final Fantasy, and this could be any game with the name Final Fantasy in it,

2380
02:44:18,400 --> 02:44:23,240
do you think should be a sequel, have a sequel done?

2381
02:44:23,240 --> 02:44:26,560
I'm tempted to say 8, so they can do it right.

2382
02:44:26,560 --> 02:44:29,160
Lookin' good, fuck you.

2383
02:44:29,160 --> 02:44:31,480
Uh, but honestly, 4.

2384
02:44:31,480 --> 02:44:33,680
If any of them. You geek.

2385
02:44:33,680 --> 02:44:37,180
I think that's a great choice, because 4 had a really interesting story.

2386
02:44:37,180 --> 02:44:38,180
2 in America, yes, for those who...

2387
02:44:38,180 --> 02:44:39,880
4 was depressing.

2388
02:44:39,880 --> 02:44:43,180
Yeah, it was pretty depressing, but...

2389
02:44:43,180 --> 02:44:45,680
Rydia 2003, motherfuckers.

2390
02:44:45,680 --> 02:44:50,180
It's like, what else could go wrong in my life?

2391
02:44:50,180 --> 02:44:53,180
Final Fantasy VI, you don't want to know what happened to Terra.

2392
02:44:53,180 --> 02:44:55,180
Because she's like my bitch.

2393
02:44:55,180 --> 02:45:01,180
They need to do a sequel to Final Fantasy VI, they can explain the goddamn ending.

2394
02:45:01,180 --> 02:45:11,180
Yeah, because it alludes to the fact that when the statues are destroyed that Terra might disappear, but she might not. It doesn't freaking give you any clue as to what actually happens to her.

2395
02:45:11,180 --> 02:45:16,180
Sorry for the lack of spoiler warning, but if you haven't beaten it by now, we figure you're probably not going to.

2396
02:45:16,180 --> 02:45:17,180
I know.

2397
02:45:17,180 --> 02:45:25,180
It doesn't matter if spoilers are given, because that game is excellent and you should play it no matter what. I mean, as far as RPG games is concerned, you have to play that game.

2398
02:45:25,180 --> 02:45:27,180
Yeah, it doesn't really spoil anything.

2399
02:45:27,180 --> 02:45:30,760
That game is so good. I've had it since it came out and I have played it like a million times

2400
02:45:30,760 --> 02:45:35,180
In fact, just like a couple of weeks ago. I started playing it again. So yeah, that game is like so awesome

2401
02:45:36,080 --> 02:45:38,880
Yeah, three or six whatever, you know

2402
02:45:44,400 --> 02:45:46,400
Eight

2403
02:45:47,480 --> 02:45:49,680
They should make eight because I

2404
02:45:50,280 --> 02:45:54,440
Don't know they were talking about making nine. That's just be a sequel to eight where they're gonna have

2405
02:45:54,440 --> 02:46:00,200
it was going to follow around the party of uh, wasn't it the same like Lagunas or something

2406
02:46:00,200 --> 02:46:01,200
like that?

2407
02:46:01,200 --> 02:46:02,200
Oh, uh, Laguna?

2408
02:46:02,200 --> 02:46:03,200
Laguna, yeah.

2409
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:09,520
No spoils because we have somebody in the room that hasn't seen the end of 8, I'm talking

2410
02:46:09,520 --> 02:46:10,520
about Irene here, so.

2411
02:46:10,520 --> 02:46:14,360
Well, it doesn't have any, I'm just saying they were supposed to follow around Laguna.

2412
02:46:14,360 --> 02:46:16,900
Are you talking about 9 before it was made?

2413
02:46:16,900 --> 02:46:17,900
They were going to?

2414
02:46:17,900 --> 02:46:20,800
Yeah, they were talking about like, it was going to be done in the point of view of Laguna.

2415
02:46:20,800 --> 02:46:21,800
Oh, weird.

2416
02:46:21,800 --> 02:46:41,800
I have an interesting rumor that went around when it was being produced, the first bit of information was given out about eight, it was just two pictures, three pictures, I'm sorry, the logo, a picture of Laguna and a picture of Squall, two male characters, and people were looking at the logo thinking that it was Laguna and Squall hugging, and then they said the theme of the story was going to be loved.

2417
02:46:41,800 --> 02:46:45,840
So the rumor about Final Fantasy VIII was that they were going to be gay, it was going

2418
02:46:45,840 --> 02:46:49,840
to be a gay love story, and everybody freaked out because of all the homophobes.

2419
02:46:49,840 --> 02:46:53,040
And I was like, that would be so funny and interesting if they could do a gay story and

2420
02:46:53,040 --> 02:46:54,040
do it good, you know?

2421
02:46:54,040 --> 02:46:55,040
I don't know.

2422
02:46:55,040 --> 02:46:56,040
Oh, hold on.

2423
02:46:56,040 --> 02:46:57,040
Rice Princess has something to say.

2424
02:46:57,040 --> 02:47:01,700
Do you have an interesting rumor?

2425
02:47:01,700 --> 02:47:03,480
I heard Rinoa had crabs.

2426
02:47:03,480 --> 02:47:07,440
She probably does, it frickin'...

2427
02:47:07,440 --> 02:47:09,360
Anyway, um

2428
02:47:09,360 --> 02:47:12,400
Does Jamie have an opinion about? Oh hold on Rob's going next one

2429
02:47:12,840 --> 02:47:15,440
No, I just wanted to say if they did do that for Final Fantasy 8

2430
02:47:15,440 --> 02:47:18,560
It would be the best video game of all time number one on G for the list, baby

2431
02:47:24,200 --> 02:47:30,900
More it was much more squall because squirrels pretty and I want like Irvine selfie, you know

2432
02:47:34,320 --> 02:47:36,320
Cool he has a gun I

2433
02:47:36,320 --> 02:47:46,320
I agree with Jamie wholeheartedly, and you know what, I've said many times before, and I'm going to say it again, the movie should have been 8, 8 should have been the movie.

2434
02:47:46,320 --> 02:47:51,320
And what he means by that is 8, the story in 8 should have been the actual movie.

2435
02:47:51,320 --> 02:47:56,320
The story of Final Fantasy the movie shouldn't have had anything to do with Final Fantasy at all.

2436
02:47:56,320 --> 02:47:59,320
Yeah, so, anywho, kind of like Mystic Quest. Anyway.

2437
02:47:59,320 --> 02:48:02,320
Mystic Quest was like Final Fantasy for babies.

2438
02:48:02,320 --> 02:48:03,320
Yeah, kind of.

2439
02:48:03,320 --> 02:48:04,320
For babies with SARS.

2440
02:48:04,320 --> 02:48:09,320
I'll tell you what Mystic Quest is. In Japan, it's called Final Fantasy USA. Thank you.

2441
02:48:09,320 --> 02:48:10,320
Yep.

2442
02:48:10,320 --> 02:48:12,320
Super Mario USA!

2443
02:48:12,320 --> 02:48:16,320
Do you know what the Final Fantasy VII in America was considered over there?

2444
02:48:16,320 --> 02:48:18,320
Final Fantasy VII International.

2445
02:48:18,320 --> 02:48:21,320
I'm playing Final Fantasy X International.

2446
02:48:21,320 --> 02:48:28,320
Which is like, basically it's as easy as Final Fantasy X, the Japanese version, but in English.

2447
02:48:28,320 --> 02:48:30,320
And it has a few extra features I heard.

2448
02:48:30,320 --> 02:48:31,320
Not really.

2449
02:48:31,320 --> 02:48:32,320
the actual DVD.

2450
02:48:32,320 --> 02:48:35,180
You can see the difficulty of your spirit grid and that's about it.

2451
02:48:35,180 --> 02:48:36,180
The DVD, the extra DVD.

2452
02:48:36,180 --> 02:48:38,000
Mine didn't come with DVD.

2453
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:41,240
They were supposed to release a separate DVD when you, maybe it was if you pre-ordered

2454
02:48:41,240 --> 02:48:42,240
it.

2455
02:48:42,240 --> 02:48:43,240
That's fine, I've already got it subtitled.

2456
02:48:43,240 --> 02:48:45,840
It was, it was a, um, like an extra spin.

2457
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:49,800
It's you know running around being retarded, seriously.

2458
02:48:49,800 --> 02:48:50,800
I haven't seen it yet, so.

2459
02:48:50,800 --> 02:48:54,200
I'll show it to you, I'll copy it for you, but I have it subtitled if anyone on their

2460
02:48:54,200 --> 02:48:55,200
chat room or...

2461
02:48:55,200 --> 02:48:57,640
Hold on, what's that have to say?

2462
02:48:57,640 --> 02:49:02,640
Okay, now I watched the show preview video for Final Fantasy X2 on G4.

2463
02:49:02,640 --> 02:49:03,640
No spoilers?

2464
02:49:03,640 --> 02:49:04,640
Oh, this isn't a spoiler.

2465
02:49:04,640 --> 02:49:05,640
Okay, go ahead.

2466
02:49:05,640 --> 02:49:07,640
In fact, it makes no sense.

2467
02:49:07,640 --> 02:49:10,640
The whole video, all it is, is Riona.

2468
02:49:10,640 --> 02:49:11,640
Riona?

2469
02:49:11,640 --> 02:49:12,640
Or, not Riona.

2470
02:49:12,640 --> 02:49:13,640
Yuna?

2471
02:49:13,640 --> 02:49:14,640
The maker?

2472
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:15,640
Whatever, Yuna.

2473
02:49:15,640 --> 02:49:16,640
Some Japanese.

2474
02:49:16,640 --> 02:49:17,640
Yuna Cross?

2475
02:49:17,640 --> 02:49:18,640
Yeah, yeah.

2476
02:49:18,640 --> 02:49:19,640
Yuna doing karaoke.

2477
02:49:19,640 --> 02:49:20,640
Singing.

2478
02:49:20,640 --> 02:49:21,640
Just singing.

2479
02:49:21,640 --> 02:49:22,640
Like some pop idol.

2480
02:49:22,640 --> 02:49:24,640
I'm like, I was watching it.

2481
02:49:24,640 --> 02:49:25,640
No, she's singing like a pop idol.

2482
02:49:25,640 --> 02:49:29,640
I'm watching and going, are they going to show anything else?

2483
02:49:29,640 --> 02:49:30,640
No.

2484
02:49:30,640 --> 02:49:31,640
Okay.

2485
02:49:31,640 --> 02:49:32,640
Well, this is interesting.

2486
02:49:32,640 --> 02:49:39,800
Did anybody see the, what was it, the Star Wars, I think it was a Lucasfilm, the little

2487
02:49:39,800 --> 02:49:46,120
Lucasarts computer game intro thing where all the stormtroopers were doing like a dance

2488
02:49:46,120 --> 02:49:47,120
or whatever.

2489
02:49:47,120 --> 02:49:48,120
No.

2490
02:49:48,120 --> 02:49:49,120
I mean, what does that have to do with it?

2491
02:49:49,120 --> 02:49:50,120
But it was funny.

2492
02:49:50,120 --> 02:49:51,120
So it's a way to promote the game.

2493
02:49:51,120 --> 02:49:52,840
Yeah, but it's heard just singing.

2494
02:49:52,840 --> 02:49:55,620
It showed nothing of the game.

2495
02:49:55,620 --> 02:49:58,920
You're supposed to be previewing the game to show me, to get me interested in playing the game.

2496
02:49:58,920 --> 02:50:01,620
All I saw was singing, like, the main theme.

2497
02:50:01,620 --> 02:50:05,120
Have you seen the Metal Gear Solid 2 commercial in Japan with G.A.C.T. in it?

2498
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:05,620
No.

2499
02:50:05,620 --> 02:50:07,620
Has nothing to do with it, but it's G.A.C.T. and so people are going to be like,

2500
02:50:07,620 --> 02:50:09,620
No, this is in our chat room.

2501
02:50:09,620 --> 02:50:12,620
It's, we're making fun of the Final Fantasy and other stories.

2502
02:50:12,620 --> 02:50:16,620
And, um, Mario's saying, uh, Yuna's going,

2503
02:50:16,620 --> 02:50:19,120
Waka, your stomach is fat, lolololol.

2504
02:50:19,120 --> 02:50:20,620
And he's like, shut the fuck up.

2505
02:50:20,620 --> 02:50:25,620
Okay... Randomness... dot dot dot com.

2506
02:50:25,620 --> 02:50:28,620
Um, anything else to add, Matt?

2507
02:50:28,620 --> 02:50:32,620
Um, yeah, looks okay, I guess.

2508
02:50:32,620 --> 02:50:36,620
But are they supposed to be doing two sequels, or one sequel to Final Fantasy X?

2509
02:50:36,620 --> 02:50:40,620
I heard a rumor there was going to be a third game in the series.

2510
02:50:40,620 --> 02:50:42,620
But, I don't know, just like...

2511
02:50:42,620 --> 02:50:44,620
But that's a rumor! Don't take my word for it.

2512
02:50:44,620 --> 02:50:46,620
Depends on how X2 ends.

2513
02:50:46,620 --> 02:50:49,620
Matt says, depends on how X2 ends.

2514
02:50:49,620 --> 02:50:53,620
Don't take my word for it.

2515
02:50:53,620 --> 02:50:54,620
Get the book.

2516
02:50:54,620 --> 02:50:58,620
I haven't given my idea my opinion.

2517
02:50:58,620 --> 02:51:04,620
This is where I came up with the idea of asking everybody is because I was out there and I was thinking, what about other games in the Final Fantasy series?

2518
02:51:04,620 --> 02:51:07,620
I think they should do a sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics.

2519
02:51:07,620 --> 02:51:10,620
Anybody who's played Final Fantasy Tactics would go, what the fuck?

2520
02:51:10,620 --> 02:51:12,620
You play the game ten times through.

2521
02:51:12,620 --> 02:51:15,620
The story is so convoluted that you're just like, huh?

2522
02:51:15,620 --> 02:51:16,120
Huh?

2523
02:51:16,120 --> 02:51:19,620
Kind of like Mission Impossible 1, but worse.

2524
02:51:19,620 --> 02:51:25,620
And, I mean, the game was, the game was, no, there was a, there was a, Matt says there was no story.

2525
02:51:25,620 --> 02:51:30,620
There was a huge, great, deep story, but you have to play the game so many times.

2526
02:51:30,620 --> 02:51:35,620
And I think it was, to figure out, and I think it had to do with translation, because there was kind of a poor translation.

2527
02:51:35,620 --> 02:51:40,620
But I think if they made a sequel that kind of tied in with the original story, they can kind of explain the original story a little better.

2528
02:51:40,620 --> 02:51:41,620
And it was a good game.

2529
02:51:41,620 --> 02:51:43,620
I think they could make another good game.

2530
02:51:43,620 --> 02:51:51,620
Instead they're doing Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, ooh, where you're the stupid kid who gets sucked into the Final Fantasy Tactics world, ooh.

2531
02:51:51,620 --> 02:51:53,620
What?

2532
02:51:53,620 --> 02:51:55,620
You're a little kid that gets sucked into the-

2533
02:51:55,620 --> 02:52:01,620
Yes, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is about a kid in the present day, and he gets sucked into the world of Final Fantasy Tactics.

2534
02:52:01,620 --> 02:52:03,620
So there's cars and stuff at the beginning.

2535
02:52:03,620 --> 02:52:05,620
Kids getting sucked.

2536
02:52:05,620 --> 02:52:07,620
Yeah, does that turn you on, you little pedophile?

2537
02:52:07,620 --> 02:52:09,620
No.

2538
02:52:09,620 --> 02:52:14,620
That would be cool to do a Final Fantasy Tactics but in like the Final Fantasy VII world.

2539
02:52:14,620 --> 02:52:19,620
Well, Cloud showed up in Final Fantasy Tactics and so there was some...

2540
02:52:19,620 --> 02:52:20,620
No, not gay.

2541
02:52:20,620 --> 02:52:25,620
Cloud was one of the strongest characters if you level him up correctly and things like that.

2542
02:52:25,620 --> 02:52:29,620
I mean he could do omni-slash and all these other cool attacks and stuff.

2543
02:52:29,620 --> 02:52:31,620
You know what I'm thinking about?

2544
02:52:31,620 --> 02:52:33,620
I'm thinking about this whole gay Final Fantasy thing.

2545
02:52:33,620 --> 02:52:37,620
And so I'm like, yeah, they should do like a sequel to Final Fantasy VII and have like the Cloud...

2546
02:52:37,620 --> 02:52:39,620
I'm going to give you some of my Gujinshi scan.

2547
02:53:07,620 --> 02:53:11,500
What about the scene where, like, Cloud has his shirt off and he's, you know, walkin'...

2548
02:53:11,500 --> 02:53:12,500
Never mind.

2549
02:53:15,500 --> 02:53:17,500
I wouldn't say that on the radio.

2550
02:53:18,500 --> 02:53:22,500
I know, I know, I'm just saying what Rice Princess just said, I would not say on the radio.

2551
02:53:22,500 --> 02:53:24,500
No, Matt, don't say it.

2552
02:53:24,500 --> 02:53:25,500
No.

2553
02:53:29,500 --> 02:53:30,500
Anyway...

2554
02:53:30,500 --> 02:53:31,500
No!

2555
02:53:31,500 --> 02:53:32,500
God, Matt!

2556
02:53:32,500 --> 02:53:33,500
Stop it!

2557
02:53:33,500 --> 02:53:37,500
Okay, Rice Princess is trying to say a bunch of, like, spoilers about Seven.

2558
02:53:37,500 --> 02:53:43,000
I know that everybody should have already played Final Fantasy 7, but I think there are people that might not have.

2559
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:46,000
I'm not giving the microphone to Matt, he's gonna ruin something.

2560
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
What? The fact that...

2561
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
I just want the microphone!

2562
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:51,000
Give me the mic.

2563
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
Oh, by the way, Aeris dies.

2564
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:54,500
Just so you know.

2565
02:53:54,500 --> 02:53:57,500
That was my favorite part of the damn game.

2566
02:53:57,500 --> 02:54:04,000
I have my game saved right there, so that I can watch her die over and over and over again.

2567
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
It might cheer every time.

2568
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:14,000
I forgot what it is, you should call her like a scum-sucking crack whore, and a homewrecker, and a man-stealer.

2569
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:27,000
Here's why I'm not getting mad at you guys, because I'm pretty sure that nobody listening hasn't played the game or had the story spoiled already.

2570
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
I mean if we had the whole world listening to us right now...

2571
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:37,000
What about in the future when they have millions of listeners and they do a rebroadcast of

2572
02:54:41,260 --> 02:54:41,880
this show?

2573
02:54:41,880 --> 02:54:46,720
I guess I'm going to have to make this episode just disappear somehow.

2574
02:54:46,720 --> 02:54:48,240
We'll bleep it out.

2575
02:54:48,240 --> 02:54:55,240
Yeah, because millions of people are going to want to sit there and tune in and listen

2576
02:54:55,240 --> 02:54:58,660
yeah and you know because millions of people are gonna want to sit there and

Boobs.

02:56:44,740 --> 02:56:46,740
Boobs? You want to talk about boobs? What about boobs?

2594
02:56:46,740 --> 02:56:48,740
Boobs are funny, but dicks are funnier.

2595
02:56:48,740 --> 02:56:49,740
Why are they funny?

2596
02:56:49,740 --> 02:57:07,460
funny? Cuz I look funny. Anyway... I seriously think that they're funny looking. I'm sorry,

2597
02:57:07,460 --> 02:57:13,660
repeat that again Brad? You know what looks phallic? Your shower curtain. What do you

2598
02:57:13,660 --> 02:57:15,660
What do you think? I mean...

2599
02:57:15,660 --> 02:57:17,660
Loki bought it.

2600
02:57:17,660 --> 02:57:21,660
It's... I swear it looks like...

2601
02:57:21,660 --> 02:57:23,660
It looks...

2602
02:57:23,660 --> 02:57:25,660
Doesn't it look like a dick?

2603
02:57:25,660 --> 02:57:29,660
It's so cool.

2604
02:57:29,660 --> 02:57:31,660
Great. So everybody's...

2605
02:57:31,660 --> 02:57:33,660
Yeah, this is great radio, you guys.

2606
02:57:33,660 --> 02:57:35,660
Rob Showerkern has a bunch of dicks on it.

2607
02:57:35,660 --> 02:57:37,660
Loki bought it?

2608
02:57:37,660 --> 02:57:39,660
No, no, no, no, no. Here.

2609
02:57:39,660 --> 02:57:41,660
Don't even start going there.

2610
02:57:41,660 --> 02:57:45,660
My girlfriend bought that for us, okay?

2611
02:57:45,660 --> 02:57:48,660
Your girlfriend has a fetish.

2612
02:57:48,660 --> 02:57:50,660
And this does not look like a penis.

2613
02:57:50,660 --> 02:57:52,660
It looks like a cow or a lock.

2614
02:57:52,660 --> 02:57:54,660
You're right, it doesn't look like a penis.

2615
02:57:54,660 --> 02:57:57,660
It looks like several of them.

2616
02:57:57,660 --> 02:58:03,660
Anybody, I don't know, if you haven't seen it yet, go look at...

2617
02:58:03,660 --> 02:58:05,660
What's his name, Geiger?

2618
02:58:05,660 --> 02:58:07,660
H.R. Geiger. Look at H.R. Geiger's works.

2619
02:58:07,660 --> 02:58:10,660
Somebody should make a shower curtain out of one of H.R. Geiger's paintings.

2620
02:58:10,660 --> 02:58:14,020
painting the one of all the dicks and vagina sticking each other and it's like

2621
02:58:14,020 --> 02:58:21,660
a big mosaic thing of it it's really mosaic um yeah Brad I think that's

2622
02:58:21,660 --> 02:58:26,980

2623
02:58:26,980 --> 02:58:33,780

2628
02:59:00,320 --> 02:59:07,680

2629
02:59:07,680 --> 02:59:18,840
know it is kind of phallic it does I don't go around smelling urine thank you

2630
02:59:18,840 --> 02:59:27,360
he said he informed me that asparagus makes your pee stink yeah okay I have a

2631
02:59:27,360 --> 02:59:34,060
late f-you of the week that somehow I didn't get before my bad tyrant would

2632
02:59:34,060 --> 02:59:39,020
like to say f-you to my ISP for not allowing me into the chat room you know

2633
02:59:39,020 --> 02:59:42,860
what f-you to other side IRC because it's been screwing up all day anyway

2634
02:59:42,860 --> 02:59:47,520
f-you to my uncanny ability to be be to get to be really great friends with

2635
02:59:47,520 --> 02:59:51,620
women but not be able to have a relationship with my own brown f-you to

2636
02:59:51,620 --> 02:59:55,420
school I'm ready to be done I don't want to do finals

2637
02:59:55,420 --> 03:00:03,820
Okay, I think it's time to get the final thoughts, what do you guys think?

2638
03:00:03,820 --> 03:00:08,340
Alright, starting off with Brad, final thought of the day.

2639
03:00:08,340 --> 03:00:13,860
The game shits the calories you burn while burninating.

2640
03:00:13,860 --> 03:00:16,460
Final thought from Matt, the Ice Queen.

2641
03:00:16,460 --> 03:00:17,460
Princess!

2642
03:00:17,460 --> 03:00:23,420
Yes, Princess Bitch did it freaking right, I need more alcohol in my life, and sex, lots

2643
03:00:23,420 --> 03:00:24,420
of sex.

2644
03:00:24,420 --> 03:00:30,880
violence then you'll have all three six months boo-hoo shut up bitch rice

2645
03:00:30,880 --> 03:00:40,020
princess your final thought this is we can get a mic over there it borrows

2646
03:00:40,020 --> 03:00:44,020
into the ground. That's all I'm going to say.

2647
03:00:44,020 --> 03:00:48,020
Okay.

2648
03:00:48,020 --> 03:00:52,020
Oh, that's on the website, isn't it?

2649
03:00:52,020 --> 03:00:56,020
No, I'm doing a thief.

2650
03:00:56,020 --> 03:01:00,020
I must not have it yet.

2651
03:01:00,020 --> 03:01:04,020
Yeah, explanation of that, real quick.

2652
03:01:04,020 --> 03:01:08,020
The thief class has a skill named hide and it has such bad

2653
03:01:08,020 --> 03:01:10,020
The entire script is horrible.

2654
03:01:10,020 --> 03:01:14,020
It hides by burrowing into the ground or whatever.

2655
03:01:14,020 --> 03:01:16,020
Burrowing in the ground.

2656
03:01:16,020 --> 03:01:19,020
I only like to burrow in the ground. I don't like burrowing above ground, thanks.

2657
03:01:19,020 --> 03:01:21,020
That's what the hide skill does.

2658
03:01:21,020 --> 03:01:23,020
Anyway, that's boring so here.

2659
03:01:23,020 --> 03:01:25,020
Loki, your final thought?

2660
03:01:25,020 --> 03:01:28,020
My final thought is...

2661
03:01:28,020 --> 03:01:30,020
If you're really, really, really, really desperate...

2662
03:01:30,020 --> 03:01:35,020
I got this really cool pop-up ad today when I was browsing hacker sites.

2663
03:01:35,020 --> 03:01:37,020
You know, one of those porno pop-ups.

2664
03:01:37,020 --> 03:01:52,020
Anyways, it's this adult finder.com or something like that, and you go and you register and you can find people that just want to have sex in your area, and it's gay, straight, everything.

2665
03:01:52,020 --> 03:01:54,020
That's kind of like gay.com.

2666
03:01:54,020 --> 03:01:56,020
Well, yeah, but...

2667
03:01:56,020 --> 03:01:58,020
You know this from experienced brats?

2668
03:01:58,020 --> 03:01:59,020
I don't know what that is.

2669
03:01:59,020 --> 03:02:03,020
The problem with gay.com in Sacramento is that everybody's already fucked everybody else.

2670
03:02:03,020 --> 03:02:05,020
Doesn't mean you can have more sex.

2671
03:02:05,020 --> 03:02:06,020
It's like what?

2672
03:02:06,020 --> 03:02:08,020
You have sex once and then it's like, oh, can I have sex again?

2673
03:02:08,020 --> 03:02:09,020
I'm sorry.

2674
03:02:09,020 --> 03:02:10,020
Is that it?

2675
03:02:10,020 --> 03:02:11,020
That is all.

2676
03:02:11,020 --> 03:02:13,020
Uh, you want me to go or you wanna go?

2677
03:02:13,020 --> 03:02:14,020
I'll go.

2678
03:02:14,020 --> 03:02:16,520
I'm gonna just take my final thought from AZHP.

2679
03:02:16,520 --> 03:02:23,020
He says, asparagus only smells bad if your gene for smelling asparagus-laden pee is dominant.

2680
03:02:23,020 --> 03:02:27,020
That must mean my mind doesn't stink.

2681
03:02:27,020 --> 03:02:28,020
Your final thought, Jamie?

2682
03:02:28,020 --> 03:02:36,260
I'm never going to ask her again.

2683
03:02:36,260 --> 03:02:42,420
My final thought for real is, GIVE ME A DOLLAR!

2684
03:02:42,420 --> 03:02:43,420
Okay.

2685
03:02:43,420 --> 03:02:44,420
That's it.

2686
03:02:44,420 --> 03:02:47,500
Thanks for supporting Orange Moms Radio.

2687
03:02:47,500 --> 03:02:50,340
I got x-ray vision.

2688
03:02:50,340 --> 03:02:54,140
Final word, Rice Princess.

2689
03:02:54,140 --> 03:02:55,140
Final word.

2690
03:02:55,140 --> 03:02:56,140
Meow.

2691
03:02:56,140 --> 03:03:00,620
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2692
03:03:00,620 --> 03:03:05,100
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Skye, and Loki.

2693
03:03:05,100 --> 03:03:07,460
We expect you a nice play again.

2694
03:03:07,460 --> 03:03:12,460
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2695
03:03:12,460 --> 03:03:23,460
Uh huh, extra cheese, uh huh, uh huh, save the cheese for me.

2696
03:03:23,460 --> 03:03:34,180
pizza party at your house i went just to check it out 19 extra lodges what a shame no one came

2697
03:03:35,060 --> 03:03:44,740
just us eating all alone you said take the pizza home no sense letting all this go to waste

2698
03:03:44,740 --> 03:03:52,260
so then i faced pizza all day and every day the speed round the clock is getting me blocked and

2699
03:03:52,260 --> 03:03:57,060
And I sure don't care with irregularity

2700
03:03:57,060 --> 03:04:02,260
Tell me why'd you have to go and make me so constipated

2701
03:04:02,260 --> 03:04:08,260
Cause right now I'd do anything to just get my bowels evacuated

2702
03:04:08,260 --> 03:04:12,260
In the bathroom I sit and I wait and I strain

2703
03:04:12,260 --> 03:04:15,260
And I sweat and I clench and I feel the pain

2704
03:04:15,260 --> 03:04:20,260
Oh, should I make laxatives or have my colon irrigated?

2705
03:04:20,260 --> 03:04:22,260
No, no, no

2706
03:04:24,260 --> 03:04:27,260
I was feeling pretty down

2707
03:04:27,260 --> 03:04:30,260
Till my girlfriend came around

2708
03:04:30,260 --> 03:04:34,260
We're just so alike in every way

2709
03:04:34,260 --> 03:04:36,260
I gotta say

2710
03:04:36,260 --> 03:04:39,260
In fact, I just thought I might

2711
03:04:39,260 --> 03:04:42,260
Pop the question there that night

2712
03:04:42,260 --> 03:04:45,260
I was kissing her so tenderly

2713
03:04:45,260 --> 03:04:47,260
But woe is me

2714
03:04:47,260 --> 03:04:50,260
Who would've guessed her family crest?

2715
03:04:50,260 --> 03:04:53,260
I'd suddenly spy, tattooed on her thigh

2716
03:04:53,260 --> 03:04:58,260
And son of a gun, it's just like the one on me

2717
03:04:58,260 --> 03:05:03,260
Tell me, how was I supposed to know we were both related?

2718
03:05:03,260 --> 03:05:09,260
Believe me, if I knew she was my cousin, we never would've dated

2719
03:05:09,260 --> 03:05:13,260
What to do now? Should I go ahead and propose

2720
03:05:13,260 --> 03:05:16,260
And get hitched and have kids with 11 toes

2721
03:05:16,260 --> 03:05:21,260
and move to Alabama where that kind of thing is tolerated

2722
03:05:21,260 --> 03:05:34,260
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

2723
03:05:34,260 --> 03:05:37,260
I had so much on my mind

2724
03:05:37,260 --> 03:05:40,260
I thought maybe I'd unwind

2725
03:05:40,260 --> 03:05:44,260
try out that new roller coaster ride

2726
03:05:44,260 --> 03:05:49,860
And the guide said not to stand Was that the demand that I couldn't meet?

2727
03:05:49,860 --> 03:05:56,260
I got on my feet and stood up and said And knocked off my head, you see

2728
03:05:56,260 --> 03:06:01,660
Tell me, would I have to go and get myself decapitated?

2729
03:06:01,660 --> 03:06:07,460
This really is a major inconvenience, oh man, I really hate it

2730
03:06:07,460 --> 03:06:13,260
The sun should dry now, can't eat, I can't breathe, I can't snore, I can't belt your yodel

2731
03:06:13,260 --> 03:06:19,260
Anymore I can't sit and roll my nose or even read Sports Illustrated

2732
03:06:19,260 --> 03:06:24,260
Oh no, might I have to go and get myself all mutilated

2733
03:06:24,260 --> 03:06:26,260
Yeah, yeah, I gotta tell ya

2734
03:06:26,260 --> 03:06:30,260
Life without a head kinda makes me irritated

2735
03:06:30,260 --> 03:06:34,260
What a bummer, I can't blink, I can't cough, I can't sneeze

2736
03:06:34,260 --> 03:06:38,260
But my neck is enjoying a pleasant breeze now

2737
03:06:38,260 --> 03:06:42,260
Haven't been the same since my head and I was separated

2738
03:06:42,260 --> 03:06:51,680
Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2739
03:07:12,260 --> 03:07:19,260
And we're back for the Orange Highlands afterbirth.

2740
03:07:24,260 --> 03:07:31,260
And everybody's sitting here talking about the godliness of Weird Al.

2741
03:07:32,260 --> 03:07:36,260
You want to hear godliness, I'll play the Eddie Murphy one.

2742
03:07:37,260 --> 03:07:38,260
I don't know.

2743

We'll play the Eddie Murphy song.

03:07:40,260 --> 03:07:42,260
Oh God.

2745

03:08:55,740 --> 03:09:02,740
we'll play part of it

2757
03:09:25,740 --> 03:09:50,980
Hey, Loki, the chat room wants you to sing along with it.

2758
03:09:50,980 --> 03:10:20,220
My girl wants to party all the time, party all the time, party all the time, party all

2759
03:10:20,220 --> 03:10:33,660
party all the time. I go once to party all the time. Party all the time. I feel like

2760
03:10:33,660 --> 03:10:42,620
I'm at a wedding and Matt's drunk. That will never happen. And that's not even at the reception.

2761
03:10:42,620 --> 03:10:44,620
It's actually the actual ceremony, by the way.

2762
03:10:54,220 --> 03:10:56,220
Body on the top.

2763
03:10:57,020 --> 03:10:59,020
God, Eddie Murphy sucks.

2764
03:11:00,220 --> 03:11:04,020
Girl, I've seen you in the club, just hanging out and dancing.

2765
03:11:04,520 --> 03:11:05,520
Okay, thank you.

2766
03:11:05,520 --> 03:11:08,520
You are not the next American Idol!

2767
03:11:16,520 --> 03:11:18,520
Are you Elton and the Chipmunks album?

2768
03:11:18,520 --> 03:11:21,520
Hey Justin, I have something from SyFam that you don't!

2769
03:11:21,520 --> 03:11:25,520
I'm the best party, I'm the best party, I'm the best party all the time!

2770
03:11:25,520 --> 03:11:30,520
My new one to party, I'm the best party all the time!

2771
03:11:30,520 --> 03:11:42,760
That was beautiful, enough of that.

2772
03:11:42,760 --> 03:11:45,500
I have to give Rob the biggest high five for that comment.

2773
03:11:45,500 --> 03:11:47,760
That was comic gold.

2774
03:11:47,760 --> 03:11:48,760
Oh my god.

2775
03:11:48,760 --> 03:11:54,720
I gotta go change my shirt, that was too much.

2776
03:11:54,720 --> 03:11:55,720
You know what?

2777
03:11:55,720 --> 03:11:57,680
Our afterburns keep getting better and better.

2778
03:11:57,680 --> 03:11:58,680
They really do.

2779
03:11:58,680 --> 03:12:03,680
That started out pretty slow, but I think we should end it now, while we're ahead.

2780
03:12:05,680 --> 03:12:07,680
Don't put that on.

2781
03:12:07,680 --> 03:12:08,680
No!

2782
03:12:08,680 --> 03:12:09,680
Put it on me!

2783
03:12:10,680 --> 03:12:11,680
We have to.

2784
03:12:11,680 --> 03:12:13,680
Put on your clothes! Put on your clothes!

2785
03:12:13,680 --> 03:12:14,680
Matt, put your clothes back on.

2786
03:12:17,680 --> 03:12:19,680
Okay, wait, we're doing another vinyl?

2787
03:12:19,680 --> 03:12:20,680
Yes.

2788
03:12:21,680 --> 03:12:22,680
I scare.

2789
03:12:22,680 --> 03:12:24,680
Is Loki gonna sing along to this?

2790
03:12:24,680 --> 03:12:25,680
He better.

2791
03:12:25,680 --> 03:12:30,680
Okay, start your recorders now. Start your recording now, because I'm not recording it, so hurry up.

2792
03:12:30,680 --> 03:12:33,680
I don't know the fucking lyrics to this song.

2793
03:12:33,680 --> 03:12:36,680
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. Don't start yet.

2794
03:12:36,680 --> 03:12:38,680
He's going to get the lyrics.

2795
03:12:38,680 --> 03:12:39,680
I can't do it without laughing.

2796
03:12:39,680 --> 03:12:41,680
You have to do this.

2797
03:12:41,680 --> 03:12:45,680
If you're going to torture us with this music, you have to at least sing with it.

2798
03:12:45,680 --> 03:12:49,680
And then do the speed mix.

2799
03:12:49,680 --> 03:12:50,680
Come here.

2800
03:12:50,680 --> 03:12:54,680
No, we don't want to use that dog too much.

2801
03:12:54,680 --> 03:13:01,680
One trick puppy. Oh god. Here we go. Alright, here we go.

2802
03:13:14,680 --> 03:13:17,680
Why did you make me do that?

2803
03:13:17,680 --> 03:13:19,680
I don't even know how to...

2804
03:13:19,680 --> 03:13:21,680
I'll tell your baby.

2805
03:13:28,680 --> 03:13:30,680
I don't even know how to kick it.

2806
03:13:30,680 --> 03:13:32,680
Just take it. Jesus.

2807
03:13:38,680 --> 03:13:40,680
You didn't play the instrumental version, did you?

2808
03:13:40,680 --> 03:13:42,680
No, I picked the extended mix.

2809
03:13:42,680 --> 03:13:44,680
You picked the extended mix?

2810
03:13:44,680 --> 03:13:46,680
Here, let me fix it.

2811
03:13:49,680 --> 03:13:51,680
Put it on the other side.

2812
03:13:51,680 --> 03:13:52,680
Ah, fine.

2813
03:13:52,680 --> 03:13:54,680
Low-key ruining everything. Good.

2814
03:13:54,680 --> 03:13:56,680
More time for people to start the recording.

2815
03:13:57,680 --> 03:13:59,680
Ah, here we go. This should probably work.

2816
03:13:59,680 --> 03:14:00,680
Alright.

2817
03:14:00,680 --> 03:14:02,680
Alright, here we go.

2818
03:14:03,680 --> 03:14:04,680
Is this the real version now?

2819
03:14:04,680 --> 03:14:05,680
This is the real version.

2820
03:14:05,680 --> 03:14:21,680
Yeah, I'm happy because I'm not the one making that ass on that fucking mic.

2821
03:14:21,680 --> 03:14:22,680
Why?

2822
03:14:22,680 --> 03:14:24,680
Is this because I want to play my music?

2823
03:14:24,680 --> 03:14:25,680
Yes, you are.

2824
03:14:25,680 --> 03:14:27,680
...

2825
03:14:29,200 --> 03:14:31,200
oh ei oh ei oh

2826
03:14:31,200 --> 03:14:33,200
oh ei oh ei oh

2827
03:14:33,200 --> 03:14:35,200
oh ei oh ei oh

2828
03:14:35,200 --> 03:14:37,200
oh ei oh ei oh

2829
03:14:37,200 --> 03:14:39,200
oh ei oh ei oh

2830
03:14:39,200 --> 03:14:41,200
oh ei oh ei oh

2831
03:14:41,200 --> 03:14:42,880
Well, I can eat your shit

2832
03:14:42,880 --> 03:14:44,480
Yeah! Where the hell is the lyrics?

2833
03:14:44,480 --> 03:14:46,480
Loki your vinyl sucks my ass

2834
03:14:52,560 --> 03:14:54,560
Nita do well

2835
03:14:54,600 --> 03:14:55,240
No

2836
03:14:55,240 --> 03:15:00,240
It's a fun way to trip and take their trades, spin around and then cross the floor

2837
03:15:01,240 --> 03:15:03,240
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh

2838
03:15:04,240 --> 03:15:09,240
All the school kids so sick of books they like to poke and they'll pay it

2839
03:15:10,240 --> 03:15:12,240
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh

2840
03:15:16,240 --> 03:15:18,240
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh

2841
03:15:19,240 --> 03:15:22,240
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh

2842
03:15:22,240 --> 03:15:23,240
Here we go, here we go.

2843
03:15:23,240 --> 03:15:25,240
Walk like he needs gym shit.

2844
03:15:25,240 --> 03:15:26,240
There you go.

2845
03:15:28,240 --> 03:15:29,240
This sucks.

2846
03:15:29,240 --> 03:15:30,240
No kidding.

2847
03:15:32,240 --> 03:15:34,240
I think the extended mix would have been better.

2848
03:15:41,240 --> 03:15:42,240
Spin the disc yo.

2849
03:15:42,240 --> 03:15:43,240
Thank you.

2850
03:15:43,240 --> 03:15:51,640
You're breaking speakers across the internet.

2851
03:15:51,640 --> 03:16:00,720
Alright, I think now is a good time to put the gun in the pervial forehead of Orange

2852
03:16:00,720 --> 03:16:01,720
Launch Radio.

2853
03:16:01,720 --> 03:16:02,720
Okay, that's it.

2854
03:16:02,720 --> 03:16:03,720
We're signing off.

2855
03:16:03,720 --> 03:16:04,720
End of afterbirth.

2856
03:16:04,720 --> 03:16:09,360
We're going to pick you now since it's six months into the year June 1st.

2857
03:16:09,360 --> 03:16:13,320
I think this is a good time to revive our non-stop New Years.

2858
03:16:13,320 --> 03:16:14,320
So enjoy.

2859
03:16:14,320 --> 03:16:18,240
We're going to start it off with ZipMania Beth and take you out throughout the evening.

2860
03:16:18,240 --> 03:16:19,760
Thanks for tuning in to Orange Launch Radio.

2861
03:16:19,760 --> 03:16:20,760
We appreciate your support.

2862
03:16:20,760 --> 03:16:22,080
Please score up our listening hours.

2863
03:16:22,080 --> 03:16:23,080
We definitely need it.

2864
03:16:23,080 --> 03:16:26,200
Vote us a five and vote Legend of Max a ten onto my cell.

2865
03:16:26,200 --> 03:16:31,440
Remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter and vote for Legend of

2866
03:16:31,440 --> 03:16:32,440
Trance.

2867
03:16:32,440 --> 03:16:33,440
What did I say?

2868
03:16:33,440 --> 03:16:34,440
Legend of Max.

2869
03:16:34,440 --> 03:16:35,440
Oh my bad.

2870
03:16:35,440 --> 03:16:36,440
Legend of Trance.

2871
03:16:36,440 --> 03:16:41,440
Oh, oh, oh, and someone needs to mix me, um, the Sandbone Trio MX300, thank you.
