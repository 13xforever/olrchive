8399	12523	Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
16146	21050	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, for Monty Talk and then some.
21730	24453	Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.
24813	28856	Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.
29437	34181	Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.
34813	38560	You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
38841	40323	Yes, I will spank your child.
40724	42467	If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.
45112	45253	Well...
48157	49338	Here's my big opening.
49818	50938	A sphincter says what?
51119	53240	I'm super, thanks for asking.
53620	56201	Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.
56241	58122	What am I doing here?
58282	59863	No.
60083	61424	Dodge this.
61884	63745	This is a tasty burger.
63985	66466	Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.
66666	67307	Yes, I have.
67747	69568	Look, just a flesh wound.
69768	75911	Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.
76957	77778	Oh yeah?
77898	81221	Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.
81441	82482	DarkSakura.
82722	83622	I've got a sniff.
83843	84403	Skye.
84503	86585	But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.
86965	87465	Loki.
87746	88747	I hate you!
89167	91208	Orange Lounge Radio.
93290	94851	Oh, the fighting's already begun.
96453	100676	We are live, and this is episode number 46 for June the 1st of 2003.
100736	101977	You're tuned in to The Beast!
106954	108735	and the money scenes.
109396	111638	Most super radio station of all things the money.
112378	114360	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
115721	117422	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
117883	122607	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Transformer herself, Jamie Summers.
122867	123868	You gave us all stars.
124788	125209	I did.
126450	127831	You know her better as Dark Sakura.
128691	130833	In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.
131654	132875	I have a clean bill of health.
133715	134296	You have a what?
134596	135597	Clean bill of health.
136153	145776	And also with us tonight, we have one special guest.
146236	148276	Say hello to the rice princess, Irene.
148916	149457	Hi, guys.
150117	152077	Brad and Matt are coming later.
152117	157018	They're going to get my mountain bike from his parents' house because I'm trying to lose weight.
157139	157999	Oh, okay.
160342	163444	Bike, Bike Revolution I made a vow.
163904	164184	Huh?
164344	164964	I made a vow.
165024	167506	I'm going to play five songs, five games of DDR every day.
168306	168706	At home?
169387	170107	At Scandia.
171148	171648	Every day?
171868	172248	Every day.
172708	173229	Every day?
173249	173529	After work.
174389	174809	After work.
175150	175590	Wow.
176570	177731	I need to get motivated to that.
177751	179632	We'll talk about some workout techniques later.
180773	184554	In the meantime, we're going to do some quick break.
185135	187036	We're going to have a fantabulous break.
187396	187916	We're going to play...
190826	193227	I'm going to play the new promo, a brand new promo.
194007	194988	Irene's all excited to hear it.
196108	197369	I worked hard on this one today.
197469	199029	This was like an hour today.
200570	201690	Rob, work hard now.
201871	202211	I know.
202591	203371	Stop the presence.
203391	206813	But actually, before that, we're going to have some music from 2DX7Style.
207813	209994	Because it's underrated.
210434	215816	I think it's underrated because obviously Konami in Tokyo doesn't like it because they haven't put out a home version of it yet.
216136	216576	Bitches.
216616	217997	So fuck them in their ears.
219116	222183	Alright, so we'll be back after some fabulous 2DX7 Sound Music.
466193	467215	Thank you for watching!
533596	534276	Outro Music
575253	579555	Orange Lounge Radio is proud to present a celebrity interview.
580415	582056	Can you introduce yourself for our listeners?
582536	583356	I'm Miss Cleo.
583896	585497	Oh, it's great to have you on the show today.
585817	586957	Hello, how are you today?
587458	588418	I'm great, thanks.
588578	589618	Did you have a question?
590039	595921	Well, yes, actually I wanted to know... Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please?
597021	597101	Uh...
597990	601632	Well, no, I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.
601892	602773	Alright, go ahead.
603133	606295	Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?
606635	607555	Is he incarcerated?
608236	609516	Uh, actually, no, he's not.
609576	611818	But what do you think of the ever-ranty DarkSakura?
611958	613258	Hi, dear, how are you?
613819	614559	I love you.
614779	616280	I see you two must know each other.
616400	617681	Well, what do you think of Skye?
618001	619942	Did he used to play football when he was in high school?
620162	621603	Well, actually, no, he didn't.
622824	624665	Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?
625125	626626	I want you to really remember...
627386	628487	The Pill, all right?
628968	630930	I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly.
631230	634173	And I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.
634894	635314	Right.
635614	638517	Okay, well, thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.
638657	643722	I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but who are all of these nosy people?
643963	647306	Outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card.
647446	648387	Get away from me.
648607	649268	Ha, ha, ha.
650880	655703	Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.
656163	657024	I'm Miss Cleo.
657364	658105	I love you.
664449	665369	Wait, sorry, we are muted.
665389	666250	Hi, welcome back.
666590	667971	That was so fucked up.
669772	673915	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 46.
675236	676196	I still have SARS.
676476	677097	This is bad.
679451	682312	This is very bad that I'm still sick after so much time.
682332	683013	It's allergies.
683133	683973	It's not sick.
684033	684754	It's the allergies.
684834	685814	No, it's not allergies.
685854	686114	I swear.
686134	687335	It's the sick of the air.
687595	689216	I think I have a brain tumor.
690356	691537	It's not the tumor.
693738	694498	No, seriously.
694539	697080	Like, my head hurts, like, right up around here.
697160	698020	It's not like a headache.
698040	700982	It's like a... I'll hit you somewhere else in your head and you won't hurt anymore.
701022	701962	That's really filthy.
702002	702683	Get away from me.
704503	705064	Oh, my God.
705104	706424	You put the hat on Cartman.
706925	707505	Yes, I did.
708086	708566	DarkSakura.com
728743	729183	I don't know.
729543	732885	By the way, you know what you didn't do last week, even though I burned them for you?
733065	733285	What?
733445	735806	Those Night Style songs from the test location.
735886	736547	Oh, you're right.
736847	738608	I conveniently... We burned them.
738808	739188	Oh, you did?
739228	744371	Well, I played some of them a few weeks ago, but, you know, we can play some... Those are ones that you didn't have.
744411	746552	We'll do some Night Style songs the next break.
746572	746912	Uh-huh.
748032	748913	They're kind of crappy.
749773	751034	The quality is, anyway.
751534	752795	I'd like to... Excuse me.
752875	753475	Okay, Kermit.
757260	758420	What are you talking about, bitch?
758500	759501	I'm just kidding.
762703	766645	I'd like to apologize to Maren Chan right off the bat because I gave her SARS when she was here last week.
767065	767666	I'm really sorry.
767766	768266	Sorry, Maren.
768366	769066	Is she listening?
769707	770387	Of course she's listening.
770587	771708	Hi!
773229	773829	What, Loki?
775690	778812	Oh, Loki's talking about causing pain to the masses and things like that.
780553	781393	Let's see, what else?
781553	782494	Oh yeah, my brain tumor.
782901	789345	So, but what's really weird, now it's like in my ear, so I'm thinking maybe I have an ear infection.
790146	796469	But then... Rodney, we need to go to Walmart and get you a new head.
798070	800132	Hey, hey, Irene, Rodney's head.
800152	804374	Whoa, wait till Brad gets here, okay?
806816	811439	It kind of reminds me, you remember, and I can make this Bomani related, you remember in Max PC...
812805	815766	I'm John Max, you see, D.R.P.C., remember Jason Enos' character?
816046	818907	How, like, the head was really small than the rest of the body?
819367	825549	It made it look like, it looked like, it reminded me of that scene from Return to Oz, where the witch, like, had all the heads in a jar.
825669	826150	Oh, God.
826190	828370	And, like, she could take into it, because the head looked faked.
828410	829891	It looked like it was just, like, screwed on.
831491	831792	Yeah.
833012	834513	Dude, Return to Oz was an awesome movie.
834573	835373	Good reference.
836753	838634	I liked it because it was, like, just like the book.
839403	841344	You know what I think we need to do on Orange Haunts Radio some night?
841404	843466	See if this is a rating success.
843546	843826	Read!
843846	846208	See if it's a rating success or a ratings disaster.
846768	848469	Because we have this neat new mixing board.
848509	849570	We can loop in the TV.
850151	852512	So we should watch a movie and comment along with it.
852592	854193	It'll be like Mystery Science Theater on the radio.
854213	855514	We need to watch Reading Rainbow.
857996	859277	I am so sad.
859357	862139	You can't AP Reading Rainbow.
862639	863640	I am sad.
863860	864140	Why?
864240	867823	About them not having any more money to do more Reading Rainbow.
868362	870663	They haven't canceled Reading Rainbow yet.
870683	872524	Yeah, but they can only do, what, four shows a year?
873004	873664	I know, it's sad.
873844	874544	That sucks.
874564	875885	They better not cancel Reading Rainbow.
875925	876865	What will LeVar Burton do?
876885	877825	That, like, sucks.
877946	878426	Oh, my God.
878466	883047	LeVar Burton will, like, have to retire because he's got... But he's a certified genius.
883087	883928	He can get... That's true.
883968	885128	They'll pay him for being smart.
885168	886869	You know what I saw on Game Show Network the other day?
887249	887469	What?
887589	889350	I saw The Weakest Link, Star Trek Edition.
889510	890330	That was great.
890390	890950	And he won.
891711	892451	Well, yeah.
892651	895272	He's, like, an actual... Isn't he... What's his name?
895922	896722	Yeah, he's Mensa.
896962	903885	And not only did he win, he got like the highest jackpot in that game's history up to that point or something like that.
905906	906646	Isn't that fabulous?
906986	908047	This is really smart.
908447	911748	See, I enjoy hearing about smart people because the world is mostly full of idiots.
913849	915690	Okay?
915990	923413	So... Smart people bring a smile to my face almost as much as seeing idiots, you know, die violent, horrible, bloody deaths.
923715	926436	Do you have any fun idiot watching stories to tell this week?
926476	928737	Have you been out to the various arcades and seen any idiots?
928917	931157	Just been driving on the road, plenty of idiots there.
931958	933598	And I was at the mall today, you know, good figure.
934178	939100	Oh, how was the rest of your day with Sharkskrull and Mel B, who were in town today?
939980	942081	Well, you were there for Mongo Chow.
942101	943141	Right, I was there for Mongo Chow.
943321	948623	And then we decided that we were going to go to the Idiot Mecca of Sacramento, which is Arden Fair Mall.
949343	952784	And of course, there's also the Idiot Mecca of Roseville, which is, you know, the Galleria.
953160	953901	What about Golfland?
954541	956302	That's just like the retard mecca.
956322	958744	There's a difference between idiots and retarded people.
959685	963087	Of course, calling that the retard mecca would probably insult retarded people everywhere.
963347	963708	Okay.
964308	974796	Anyway, there were lots of stupid people everywhere and they were all driving and they were in the parking garage and we found like a really nice parking spot because it was in the second level of the garage by Sears so it was all shady.
974896	977518	It's still hot and hot sucks.
978999	981400	And then all the expresses everywhere are closed.
981420	981741	Everywhere.
981801	982121	Everywhere.
982813	983333	The stores?
983573	983834	Yeah.
984054	984214	Why?
984234	985515	Because they're remodeling or something.
986335	986995	That sucks.
987035	988076	She came all the way out here.
988096	989677	So Sharkskull wasted her trip completely?
989797	991818	Well, no, because she got something at Hot Topic.
991838	992058	That's true.
992078	993939	She got a big, sloppy, fuzzy black hat.
994660	995000	Whoa.
996641	997301	It's a hat.
998382	999102	Sounds kind of kinky.
999483	1000243	It's a hat.
1001664	1003285	And we went to Torrid.
1003625	1004426	No, it's not a kinky hat.
1004706	1005386	It's a cute hat.
1006427	1010189	And we went to Torrid, and I looked at clothes I can't buy yet because I haven't gotten paid, and...
1011536	1013718	And then we listened to Strong Bad on the way home.
1013858	1019382	Then we went to Scandia, ran into DJ Syndrome, and ran into... We need to get him on the show some night.
1019682	1021863	We ran into Ryan, some name I guess.
1022604	1023885	We need to get him back on the show some night.
1023905	1026727	I know, because he's been falling off the face of the earth.
1027027	1028488	No kidding, and where's Intern Zero?
1028928	1030510	Intern Zero is probably working.
1030650	1031030	Oh, that's true.
1031050	1032691	Because remember, he works for my man now.
1032831	1033252	That's right.
1033272	1035013	He is now indirectly my bitch.
1038402	1047149	And all of these celebrity interviews that we'll be doing in future weeks, you know, we'll always ask about Intern Zero, because we're always curious about, you know, what the celebrities think of our intern.
1047949	1050631	Because we're very privileged to have Intern Zero on board here.
1051952	1062280	Well, it's, you know, we have a very privileged group, and, you know, we need to not forget about our foreign correspondent from the People's Republic of Davis, Abandoned Hope, all you who enter here, TM.
1063581	1065502	Yeah, we need to get Puppy back on the show, too.
1065522	1066263	Yeah, we need Puppy.
1066523	1067824	Puppy, get your ass back out here.
1068522	1071503	Now, or we spank you with a rolled up newspaper.
1071964	1072784	Bad puppy.
1072904	1074705	I'm waiting for the big sniff in the chat room.
1076886	1077366	Waiting, waiting.
1077546	1084549	Oh, if you want to join our chat room, head on over to www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and then click on chat.
1085750	1086450	Chat, chat, chat, chat, chat.
1086910	1088491	And then you can chat with our chatters in the chat room.
1090772	1095854	And I feel really irresponsible because we're supposed to be working on the Battle Royale role-playing instead of him playing Ragnarok.
1097415	1097695	Ha!
1097715	1097755	Ha!
1098650	1102333	I am so glad that it's gone pay-to-play.
1102573	1107677	I am seriously thinking of starting Ragnarok now, because, like, I was watching Brad play the other night.
1107757	1109038	It was comedy gold.
1109239	1109799	Isn't it great?
1109879	1111781	Well, you tell your Ragnarok story first.
1111841	1115383	Okay, they went pay-to-play, which is the best thing that could have ever happened.
1115724	1123750	I mean, sure, I'm going to have friends who I used to... who helped me level and get where I am today, character-wise, who are not going to pay-to-play.
1124371	1125552	But, like, one friend gave me...
1126539	1155716	Like 250,000 zenny, which was a lot of the money in the game So I went out and bought a bunch of armor And now my character's badass And on top of that, since they introduced the pay-to-play Like today's the actual day it starts The server congestion went from about 13,000 people logged in To 6,500 Right around there Therefore there's no lag All of you people who decided to quit, thank you I love you
1156857	1159759	But see, I'm thinking about starting to join now after watching Brad play the other day.
1159799	1160319	That's fine.
1160439	1162540	Now, you and Brad play on different servers, though.
1162760	1163901	Yes, play on Chaos.
1163921	1165542	Can you move your character from one server to another?
1165702	1166482	Nope, you'll lose everything.
1166502	1167123	That's ass.
1167723	1168343	That is so ass.
1168363	1170124	But you can make two characters, one on each server.
1170765	1171225	That might work.
1171545	1172886	But you have to play on Chaos with me.
1173126	1175527	Okay, but if I do it, if, if.
1175607	1177468	I still have to cancel my PSO account first.
1177528	1179689	Mine was already canceled, believe it or not.
1179870	1180130	Really?
1180410	1181671	I didn't even know mine was canceled.
1182471	1183792	I looked up my stuff on...
1184577	1191143	If you go to Sega.com slash PSO underscore GCN I wonder if they just cancel you automatically if you don't play.
1191723	1193344	Bless their little hearts if that's what they do.
1193405	1197048	They keep your information there in case you want to start back up.
1197508	1199710	But I might start PSO back up later.
1200130	1208137	But for right now, that's been my... I'll play, then I'll let my character sit and heal while I go off and do other stuff.
1208602	1211384	Marin has given us the Ragnarok report.
1211545	1214527	There is currently 3,800 people logged into Chaos.
1215087	1215488	Thank you.
1216569	1227077	And see, I'm so glad that she's paying to play too, because then I get my sauce on Ragnarok with me, and I can say, I have 50 fire arrows for you.
1227958	1231861	Okay, for those that don't play Ragnarok online, you visit the website www.
1231881	1233202	Ragnarok online.
1233222	1233622	R-A-G-N-A...
1238246	1240988	R-O-K online dot com.
1241368	1241668	Excellent.
1241708	1243929	Maybe somebody in the chat room will be so kind as to post a link.
1244890	1248412	And it's $12 a month unless you do pay by cash.
1248572	1250293	Then it's a little bit more because of the service charge.
1251034	1253995	But it's not continuously updating your pay.
1254656	1256457	So you have to pay every month manually.
1257157	1258498	That's actually good.
1258658	1260599	You can pay up to six months in advance.
1261500	1262100	I paid three.
1262160	1265582	It's a little bit cheaper to pay three months or six months in advance.
1265702	1267163	But I paid three months in advance.
1268880	1273063	and if you want to find me on there, my username is Sorato, it's the only one I have.
1273303	1274424	So what's the game like?
1274504	1277647	It's kind of like, the best way I can describe it is kind of like a multiplayer Secret of Mana.
1278207	1291697	Yeah, it's like playing Secret of Mana, you have your individual character, you can form a party, you can share experience, which is really good if you're all trying to get levels quickly, because then every time you fight something, you'll all gain levels together.
1293478	1298322	You can buy stuff, upgrade your armor, you can make your own quest.
1299986	1307270	There's also bosses hidden in the game where you and a billion other people can just tag team and rape this guy.
1310792	1313534	Tag team raping only on Ragnarok Online.
1313774	1315255	Like the Troll King or something.
1316295	1319797	In the chat room, RiceRYC3 says, It's like Diablo 2 but cuter.
1320878	1322098	I've been hearing it's not like Ultima.
1322839	1323459	Ultima Online.
1323519	1324400	Oh, I never did play that.
1325140	1326601	It's all point and click killing stuff.
1327003	1329784	Let me tell my funny, because I was watching, or actually it's really Brad's funny.
1329804	1340446	I was watching Brad play the other day, and I guess he was talking about this guy who was, you know, because of the server change, there's a lot of people, or the fact that they're going pay-to-play, there was a lot of people giving shit away on there.
1340846	1345667	So there was this guy, and he stood there, and he said, I'm going to give away my armor, and it's like this super rare armor.
1345687	1347468	He says, I'm going to give away my armor in ten minutes.
1347508	1348048	I'll be right back.
1348482	1353165	So he, you know, he says that, and then all these people just start crowding around him, like tons and tons of people.
1353325	1354845	He's probably got lots of whispers.
1356106	1357587	I mean, just masses of people around him.
1357907	1361449	And then after ten minutes of this up, he goes, just kidding, and runs away.
1363210	1364370	There was a guy in there.
1364390	1365991	Leaving all the people standing there.
1366552	1368773	Who kept dropping cards and then picking them up.
1369953	1376737	And then he's like, I'm going to drop all my cards, because cards are like, they're a one in one million item or something that you can fit.
1377738	1378819	I've gotten like a bajillion of them.
1379500	1382362	Anyway, he says he's going to give away all of his cards.
1382482	1388807	And so he drops one card, which is like a pouring card, which is like this little pink bubble thing, which is the weakest character in the game.
1389467	1395131	And then he starts dropping like twigs, branches, flowers, which are all like little crap stuff.
1396372	1396673	Awesome.
1397713	1405019	The other thing I watched Brad do, I actually suggest this, because this is the crazy thing about Ragnarok Online, is that when you go into the towns, there's just...
1405579	1406681	Masses of people there.
1406841	1408944	I mean... Hi, we're AFK and clogging the server.
1409084	1412449	Oh my god, there's just people just standing there in the middle of the town.
1412489	1413771	I mean, it looks like China.
1414221	1415702	in there, I swear to God.
1415982	1417842	Hey, and you can get flu masks in the game.
1417883	1420464	You can put yourself up for Ragnarok cars.
1420484	1422304	I swear to God, Ragnarok online looks like China.
1422624	1428327	So, like, you go into the middle of the street or whatever, so I told Brad, hey, there's that big clusterfuck of people standing in the middle of the screen.
1428647	1431348	Go run around them and go, I have SARS, cough, cough, cough.
1432548	1433289	And so he did it.
1433389	1436730	He ran in, he ran in the middle of the group, and he's all, I have SARS, cough, cough, cough.
1437230	1443793	Literally, the second after he did that, someone summoned a monster into town that just started running around killing all the people that were idling.
1444269	1444909	It was great.
1445209	1446230	And Brad's like, gotta go!
1447250	1450331	This is great, though, because people have been protesting the charge.
1450711	1452692	Which is, I think, so retarded.
1452972	1458594	Because they knew from the beginning that the whole reason that they were beta testing us is that you would eventually pay for the service.
1459555	1460395	So this is great.
1461355	1464517	And for all you people who play, I don't know if they still have it up, but this is hilarious.
1466217	1467057	There's a warp.
1467838	1468458	And the phone's ringing.
1468478	1468558	Okay.
1468962	1469682	There's a warp.
1469742	1471684	We can't take phone calls on the show yet, sorry.
1471724	1475566	On the south gate of, uh, Pontera, which is like the middle, uh, town.
1476446	1483190	And, uh... Oh, stop picking it up.
1483390	1483630	What?
1483650	1485491	It's spam.
1485511	1486072	Oh, it's spam?
1486132	1486212	Yeah.
1487893	1489354	Do not ruin this show to bring us...
1490515	1515221	Hand, hand, hand, hey, hand, hey, hand, hand, hey That could have been the most important call of my life, according to that Hand, come here, hand, hand, hand I was only telling a story Alright, sorry Jamie They set up a warp right in the gate, the south gate of town So if you leave town, you go into this warp And it warps you to the Christmas village
1516526	1520588	So like you're in, and everybody is trapped in a corral with no way out.
1520608	1521648	That's right.
1522328	1527370	So the only way you can get out is to use something called a fly wing, which will teleport you to another part of town.
1528591	1531772	Luckily for me, I have a fly wing, so I go to the other part of town.
1532472	1536554	And there's always people going, let us out, let us out.
1536854	1538154	And I'm like, ah.
1538654	1539335	And then I got killed.
1539615	1540415	And then I went back there.
1541491	1556598	and like if you leave there you have to like dodge abominable snowmans and things and like they'll like they're aggressive so they chase you but I have high agility so I run away this is a fun topic I want to solicit stories from the chat room if anybody has any funny online game stories this is really nerdy but it can be funny
1557048	1561331	If anybody has any really good online game stories that are funny, send them to me in private message in the chatroom.
1561371	1562611	Well, this is the part that sucks.
1562651	1568915	The only way out of the Christmas Village, besides warping, is going through the south warp past all the aggressive creatures.
1569335	1572257	It takes you to a city called Aldebaran, which is like way in the north.
1572937	1579341	The only way to get out of that town is to walk past three screens full of aggressive creatures that will kill me in two hits.
1580882	1581563	And I made it out.
1581683	1582163	I was happy.
1584234	1589196	The wizards or whatever, weren't they the ones that were like, you have to pay me to get out of here and I can warp you out of here?
1589216	1590557	Yeah, they have the ability to warp.
1590917	1593838	And some of them in the game, they're just like, may I have the heal, please?
1593858	1594378	And they'll heal you.
1595138	1595758	I'm like, hey, cool.
1596058	1597999	And I ran into a swordman.
1598119	1601200	Swordies are cool to hang out with because they'll kill stuff for you.
1602361	1604801	If you're low level, they'll kill stuff and then they'll let you tank on them.
1605282	1609883	Which tanking means they'll attack a creature once so that the creature keeps hitting them over and over.
1610163	1612104	And you can kill the creature and get the experience from it.
1613385	1617328	and so I hung out with one who killed a bunch of people for me and then I left.
1619569	1621590	Does Ragnarok still have really bad English?
1621990	1623271	Yes, it's beautiful.
1623752	1625673	It's core English.
1626573	1627674	Because remember, it's Korean.
1630616	1634698	Okay, so I'm going to shift gears and talk about a different online game that we brought up earlier, PSO.
1635199	1640222	I think I mentioned this on a previous show, but I'll tell you the funniest thing I've ever seen in PSO.
1640582	1641883	Were you there, Loki, when I was watching this?
1642421	1643202	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1659538	1664403	There were all these people standing there and then one guy decides to just start running laps around the room.
1664684	1667086	He's just running around in a giant circle.
1667406	1672491	You actually can see everybody watching him as he's running around the circle on the screen.
1672852	1674133	And people are going, what the hell?
1675034	1678798	And then suddenly a couple other guys decide to join him and they all start running around in a circle.
1678818	1682181	And then suddenly the entire server room is doing a big conga line.
1683192	1684973	It was the gayest thing ever, but it was so funny.
1685033	1687515	I'm going to send some pictures for next week.
1687575	1688536	I have pictures.
1689276	1692359	Every so often I'll save the screen capture for when I'm playing Ragnarok.
1692939	1702227	I have a picture of this place in the desert town where I was getting my weapons upgraded and some friends met me there and then random people were there and we all formed a conga line.
1704168	1706770	StaplerX has an interesting story to share here in our chat room.
1706810	1709072	He says, My friend Chris made a female account.
1709778	1712299	and as soon as he logged in, a guy started flirting with him.
1712639	1716260	He kept stalking him until he logged out and he never used the account again.
1716640	1719860	Do you ever find yourself getting hit on as a female game player?
1719880	1722261	All the time, but it's a good thing because they give me stuff.
1725102	1725882	I have a story.
1726982	1738805	We played, well this was back when Ultima Online was first getting started and we were just being really stupid so what we did was we stripped our character of all of his clothes and just said he got player killed
1739375	1741076	and kept begging for stuff from people.
1741496	1743958	And the player's name was Italian Sausage.
1744478	1750842	And so, um, we were just running around yelling Sausage for Sale and just being, like, really annoying.
1751082	1751803	Wait, what game was this?
1752263	1752763	Ultima Online.
1752883	1753384	Oh, okay, Ultima Online.
1753944	1754484	It was fun.
1754864	1755945	We were really bored that day.
1757786	1759567	There's also a lot of idiots on Ragnarok.
1760708	1766652	Just randomly, I was in this one place that, um, that, um, Marienchan, uh, showed me.
1766812	1768913	This is an island that you have to get to from Alberta.
1769733	1770773	Anyway, we were just sitting there.
1771293	1773474	Like, I'm in the cave leading in.
1773534	1774094	I'm just waiting.
1774194	1775514	So I set up a chat room in there.
1775915	1777935	Said, toll booth 200 zeni.
1778475	1779175	And people paid me.
1782816	1783236	I got like 600.
1783436	1785077	That's awesome.
1785137	1786577	And other people, this is a great idea.
1786597	1787677	They set up a kissing booth.
1787697	1791658	Because there's an emoticon in the game that makes a smoochie and then a little heart comes up.
1792219	1793059	And they're making money.
1794839	1796740	So I want to do, though, what one of my friends did.
1796780	1798040	I forgot who this was.
1798823	1799603	It was so long ago.
1799623	1810446	One of the people I was playing with back when I first was playing the second beta, decided, they wrote on the pages, like, sex or 500 zenny or something.
1810986	1811066	Or 5,000.
1811566	1814807	And so, the person went in there and paid up front.
1815187	1816247	She was like, haha, you got fucked.
1820708	1821288	That's great.
1822869	1827990	So, okay, we can bring this around to Bomani somehow, believe it or not, because with the new DDR going to go online,
1829511	1829891	Oh, yay.
1829951	1830111	Oh, yay.
1830131	1833614	I think it should be like DanceMagic.
1855287	1856268	This is why we should work for Konami.
1885993	1887774	I'm looking for funny stories right now.
1889335	1890235	Are you enjoying that food?
1890275	1890615	Thank you.
1891636	1893076	More funny online gaming stories.
1893677	1893877	What?
1895477	1895898	I think so.
1896078	1897018	They're probably in the cupboard up there.
1897878	1898118	Anyway.
1898479	1898719	Hi.
1899779	1905422	Rice, RYC3, would like to say, This one time I was playing Counter-Strike and the server had friendly fire on.
1905822	1908103	I just entered the server and killed this guy for his gun.
1908143	1909463	He got pissed and I left the server.
1910044	1910364	Meanie.
1912365	1913245	Yeah, you can have some Triscuits.
1916039	1918160	Dieter, our angel, has a story to share.
1918801	1921402	Dad and I were playing Diablo 2 on our own server.
1921862	1926324	We came to Upper Cresat and go after the council members one by one.
1926745	1929766	I start running around just to get the little monsters to get experience.
1929846	1933488	Next thing you know, somehow I end up having all seven council members chasing me.
1933928	1934789	I scream, help!
1935149	1936369	Dad goes, how did you do that?
1936609	1937830	I go, I don't know.
1938210	1941612	Dad proceeds to kill all their asses in less than five minutes while I lay there dead.
1945256	1950418	That's so interesting, because I've never heard of anybody playing online games with their parents.
1950478	1952739	That would scare me, to run into my mother.
1953339	1958421	Like, Terry would totally, I could see that happening, like, when his kids get older, he'd be gaming with them.
1958901	1974046	Well, he's just cool like that, and you know that any of us, when we have kids, we're going to play games with our kids, too, but I just, as it is now, I could never imagine, like, my mother, or my dad, no, my dad's actually computer savvy, and there are some computer games he's played in the past, mostly solitaire and shit, like card games, but...
1974935	1980417	If I were to run into him on an online game, I'd, like, zap him so he couldn't, like, he couldn't embarrass me.
1980457	1981077	I'd kill him.
1982658	1983718	You know what my party is named?
1985119	1985339	Huh?
1986179	1987499	My party is named Battle Royale.
1988280	1988740	Of course.
1989400	1991161	I want to make a guild called Battle Royale.
1991681	1992421	Or BR Act.
1994922	1995582	The BR Act.
1997243	1997303	Um...
1998414	2002415	I really like that idea of DDR Online having a dancing conquest.
2002576	2002996	That would be cool.
2003016	2003436	That would be awesome.
2003456	2008197	What other cool DDR Online ideas have people thought of in their... How about this?
2008518	2009958	How about they don't make it?
2010798	2012079	Ooh, there's an idea.
2012099	2015740	I know what's wrong.
2015820	2016180	You're here.
2016600	2017561	Shut up, bitch.
2018101	2019881	That has nothing to do with the topic of the ad.
2021562	2026424	I think they should make Stroker Online, because that combination would work great.
2027708	2028969	Nobody gets that, Loki.
2029049	2029529	Nobody.
2030050	2030630	I don't care.
2031391	2032932	You know what game they need to make another one of?
2033112	2033352	What?
2033572	2034553	Freaking Night Trap.
2035914	2036875	Night Trap 2.
2036995	2038436	That would be the shit.
2038496	2039037	Did you hear that?
2039137	2039877	Oh, wait.
2039917	2040958	No, Night Trap wasn't on 3DO.
2041018	2042779	It was a Sega CD game, wasn't it?
2042799	2043820	I own the damn game.
2044140	2045281	It was a Sega CD.
2045301	2046762	3DO filed for bankruptcy this week.
2047002	2047443	Yay!
2047563	2054088	And whenever I think of 3DO, though, I think of that horrible, horrible, horrible Zelda game.
2055569	2056229	That was a CD-I.
2056249	2056790	That was a CD-I.
2057463	2058243	Wasn't that 3DO?
2058343	2059704	No, it was 3DX.
2060364	2061004	Never mind.
2063005	2066506	3DO I'll always remember as the first time playing You Don't Know Jack.
2067806	2069427	What the fuck did 3DO do then?
2069867	2071527	They made the stupid Army Man games.
2072768	2073668	Didn't they have a system?
2073768	2075369	Wasn't there a system called 3DO?
2075389	2077249	There was a 3DO, but I don't think it was the same people.
2077469	2079370	What the fuck was on the 3DO system?
2080130	2080710	Flashback.
2081271	2081651	That's it?
2081691	2083211	That was their biggest game was Flashback?
2083711	2085832	They had this, like, it was supposedly this, you know...
2086294	2086874	What was it called?
2086914	2088814	The something M technology?
2089034	2090435	They had Road Rage.
2091075	2091755	Okay, here we go.
2092115	2092855	Road Rage.
2093355	2094395	Eternal Champions.
2094475	2095196	Thank you, chat room.
2095236	2097476	Eternal Champions was not on the freaking 3DO.
2097736	2098136	Are you sure?
2098476	2101017	I'm more than positive Kabuki Clash was on the 3DO.
2104957	2107598	I just remember those things were like 400 bucks.
2107698	2108278	Fuck that.
2108358	2112539	Eternal Champions was on the Genesis and the Eternal Champions CD was on the Sega CD.
2112999	2114319	I own the game and I should know.
2114459	2115179	I even bought...
2116140	2116901	What was the thing called?
2116921	2117521	The Menacer?
2117722	2118562	Wasn't that what it was called?
2119303	2119983	The Activator.
2122465	2123145	I have got a Menacer.
2123366	2124486	But I've got an Activator too.
2124506	2125988	The one that's like the arena.
2126728	2128709	I bought it at Virgin like a year ago.
2130531	2132052	Yeah, and it came with Eternal Champions.
2135254	2136175	It's in my closet.
2136395	2136735	You know what?
2136815	2140298	I kind of want a CDI system and a 3DO just because
2140868	2142188	You know, nobody has them.
2142349	2144049	You know what shitty system I want?
2144589	2144829	What?
2145070	2146090	A Jaguar CD.
2147150	2148031	I want a Jaguar.
2148051	2149091	So I can play Defender 2000.
2149751	2150752	I want Tempest 2000.
2151212	2153313	Okay, you can get it on Saturn then.
2153353	2155253	Okay, but I want the Jaguar version.
2155853	2156514	Same damn name.
2158274	2162716	But it's Atari system and it's Atari game, so... And it's easier to control on the... Shush!
2165317	2165717	That's it.
2165937	2166837	You've got a Saturn, right?
2167798	2168418	Do I have a Saturn?
2170054	2170815	Loki has a Saturn.
2170855	2172236	I'll bring you over Tempest 2000 next week.
2172336	2172876	Oh, dear Lord.
2173917	2174317	That's it.
2174357	2176578	Pre-show next week should be all Tempest 2000 songs.
2176618	2177219	I'm down with that.
2179780	2186024	Actually, I want to do... Jamie, you have to let me do one pre-show one week because I want to do... Yes.
2186524	2188285	I want to do Commodore 64 music.
2188385	2189366	Oh, my God, yes.
2190226	2195089	Did you hear what Bradley posted in response to your Commodore 64?
2195309	2195589	Hold on.
2195629	2196090	Let me bring it up.
2196150	2196250	Okay.
2196270	2196350	Okay.
2196946	2200307	For those of you that listen to Orange Lingerie like all the time, that would be the cool people.
2200807	2206529	On Friday night, you would have heard me doing a fuck-off show because I was really bored and Irene flaked on me for going out Friday night.
2207430	2211691	So I played a bunch of 80s music and that led into talk about Commodore 64.
2212191	2215232	Because the Commodore 64 was like the coolest computer system ever.
2215572	2217473	And it just turned 20 years old like two months ago.
2217573	2221154	But anyway, so I had a point to this.
2221414	2223495	Oh yeah, I started downloading all these games and stuff.
2223883	2229006	and one of them, one of the most memorable games for me on Commodore 64 was Impossible Mission.
2229587	2231228	Tell us a little bit about Impossible Mission, Irene.
2232789	2234190	It was really cheesy.
2234210	2240013	It had really bad voice acting and you basically had to try to like put them together as well.
2240334	2243315	They were like pieces of paper that had little, you know, squiggly marks and stuff.
2243335	2247178	But anyway, it had really bad like pseudo voice acting.
2247728	2252050	and Rob's going to be pulling up a special treat or whatever.
2252150	2253270	It was really hard.
2253290	2257972	You had to time it and if you didn't beat it by then, then you died for some reason.
2258172	2258913	I don't really remember.
2259653	2260793	Yeah, but it was a great game.
2260913	2262934	Hey Rob, you know what I want to bring over?
2264415	2264655	What?
2265295	2266075	My ColecoVision.
2266876	2268036	What do you have on ColecoVision?
2268076	2269677	What don't I have?
2270457	2271418	That was the Odyssey.
2271918	2272298	My bad.
2272678	2275079	You don't even have a TV that my Odyssey will work with.
2275711	2280135	You need one of those old ones with, like, the prong hookup thingies.
2281736	2282256	Okay, hold on.
2282276	2284258	I'm going to download that sound clip we were talking about earlier.
2284418	2284978	Oh, my God.
2285999	2286379	If I can get it.
2286399	2287280	But we need to play Smurfs.
2290122	2293265	Or I can bring over the 2600 and we can play the worst game ever.
2293505	2293745	What?
2294106	2295547	E.T.
2295687	2296387	Or Pac-Man.
2296528	2299250	I saw this hilarious commercial on G4 today.
2299570	2303273	There was this guy, and I guess he was a programmer or whatever, and he says, Hey, I'm so-and-so.
2303763	2311047	and I programmed Yar's Revenge and I programmed, um, he said, I programmed Yar's Revenge and I programmed, what was the other thing he'd done?
2311467	2316249	And then he goes, he said, I programmed Yar's Revenge, I programmed Raiders of the Lost Ark and I programmed E.T.
2317290	2318110	He's like that.
2318350	2322352	He's like, so I'm known for one of the best 2600 games of all time and one of the worst.
2323973	2326374	Anyway, oh, here's that sound file we were talking about earlier, kids.
2329736	2330036	Arrrr!
2330896	2331096	Arrrr!
2331797	2331897	Arrrr!
2334839	2339021	That's the sound every time you die or fall down a hole or you see Irene naked.
2344425	2345345	Don't touch.
2351049	2351809	Wait, what, Loki?
2351829	2354010	It should be in the next intro, he says.
2354491	2355051	Yes, I agree.
2355131	2355751	You know what?
2355891	2356332	You know what?
2356352	2358293	I'll bring the 5200 over and we'll play Kicks.
2360151	2362652	I've actually got promo for the prototype.
2363472	2368873	They did... And they put these out, I think, at one of the classic gaming conventions, which I want to go to in Vegas.
2370394	2373995	But they... I think it's Classic Gaming Expo is the one that's in Vegas every year.
2374435	2375935	Oh, I hell want to go to that.
2375955	2376475	When is that?
2377036	2379356	I don't... I think it's in August is when it's coming up.
2379716	2381357	I hope it's not the same weekend as Cyber Beat Nation 2.
2382077	2382597	I don't know.
2383357	2384798	But... Well, anyway...
2387053	2388894	They have prototype games.
2388914	2390776	They've actually cartridge-ized and everything.
2391256	2392377	And this guy sold them on eBay.
2393658	2399302	We picked up Super Pac-Man, which is my favorite Pac-Man game.
2399342	2399963	Yes, I agree.
2400003	2401284	Super Pac-Man is the best Pac-Man game.
2401364	2402925	And we picked up Millipede.
2404727	2405407	I've got a trackball.
2405948	2406288	Ah, cool.
2407505	2410326	Nothing beats playing Millipede on a 5200 with a trackball.
2411026	2414627	There's very few experiences that are as beautiful as that.
2415387	2416307	Except playing kicks.
2416508	2419068	I have a quick Bomani-related question when it comes to Atari 2600.
2419688	2422529	Wasn't somebody trying to develop Dance Dance Revolution for the 2600?
2423269	2423549	Yes.
2423870	2424670	Whatever happened with that?
2424710	2426970	Loki, you probably follow that stuff better than any of us.
2427390	2431692	No, it's because people still program for the 2600 for I don't know what reason.
2431852	2432732	Because it's fun.
2433532	2436533	They were trying to create like a sort of Dance Dance Revolution type game.
2437037	2446804	And the problem is they had to do it horizontally instead of vertically because I guess the vertical refresh rate isn't as fast as the horizontal refresh rate or something like that.
2447304	2449086	It's like playing Beatmania on the WonderSwan.
2453729	2454350	Yeah, you were saying?
2455050	2458192	Anyway, so yeah, I don't think that it ever went anywhere.
2459233	2460574	Know what I want to get?
2461074	2463216	They have for your cell phones...
2464139	2466781	Or for certain cell phones, you know how you can put games on there?
2466961	2467682	Yeah, pump it up.
2468682	2469923	Yeah, I heard about that.
2470083	2472004	But I couldn't find where you download it.
2473345	2474606	I think it's only for Korean cell phones.
2474626	2476648	There's pictures on one of the DDR Live Journal things.
2478409	2479490	I'm too lazy to go look them up.
2480810	2482512	Triscuits are garlicky.
2482912	2483812	I think we need to take a break.
2484493	2485334	Let's take a quick break.
2485354	2488816	We're going to do a break and this is... They still have the memory of cheese attached to them.
2489096	2491197	We're going to play some 9th style songs this break.
2491238	2493319	So the quality of the MP3s is kind of eh.
2494457	2497678	But you guys might enjoy these anyway.
2497738	2501559	So it's a free preview here of what's coming up on Night Style.
2501619	2503600	We're going to play the following songs.
2504300	2509601	Emotion, 2003, Romantic Extra, Abyss, Let's Say Hello, and Distress.
2509721	2512602	So we're going to hear all those fabulous Night Style songs.
2512642	2513322	And then we'll be back.
2514343	2515303	Sound like a plan.
2516663	2516923	Word.
2517183	2518644	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
2519565	2526471	If you want to join in the fun in the chat room, and they're all reminiscing about classic video games right now, I'm seeing all these great games being named right now.
2526591	2536379	Adventure, Beachhead, Mule, or I should say M-U-L-E, Warlord, Combat, anyway.
2538721	2541022	So we will be right back after some Night Style MP3s.
2541042	2545406	So the quality of these is kind of eh, but it will give you an impression of what you can look forward to very soon.
2546448	2547409	we'll be back
2576935	2577460	DarkSakura
2632924	2633567	Thanks for watching!
2680311	2681731	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2746753	2747563	Thanks for watching!
2771554	2772515	DarkSakura.com
2806070	2806972	Thank you for watching
2841678	2842718	Thank you for watching!
2892293	2895483	DarkSakura
3007677	3010039	It's more contagious than SARS.
3011560	3013361	It's Orange Lounge Radio.
3016002	3016463	Howdy.
3017023	3017463	We're back.
3018004	3018424	How are you?
3019024	3019705	SARS-erific.
3019725	3022767	I hope you enjoyed those 9th style preview songs.
3022827	3026809	I know the quality was a little poopy, but, you know, they always are at first.
3026849	3029231	I'm surprised we haven't had better ones by this point yet, though.
3030532	3032773	I'm so happy about the second to last one.
3033113	3034194	The Let's Say Hello?
3034514	3034774	Uh-huh.
3034954	3035475	That one is cool.
3035495	3035935	That song's cute.
3036371	3038332	It sounds worthy of, like, poppin' music-ness.
3038352	3039433	It makes me think of Murmur Twins.
3041434	3042355	You think it's the same group?
3042455	3043055	I don't think it is.
3043535	3044896	No, it just makes me think of Murmur Twins.
3046497	3048618	I don't know who did that, and I'm too lazy to look it up right now.
3051060	3051980	So, we're back.
3052781	3053922	Hello, how are you?
3056383	3057003	I'm trying to think.
3057784	3058544	I'm hazelnutty.
3059025	3059625	And garlicky.
3060806	3063227	I noticed Loki's working on some things over there.
3063387	3064348	You want to do the cage match?
3065441	3066982	Sure, did I bring a song?
3067402	3068183	You did bring a song.
3068443	3069424	Okay, I forgot if I did.
3069444	3069844	Yes, you did.
3069864	3071806	Okay, we're going to do the cage match.
3072226	3077350	So, because we usually don't do the cage match early in the show, we're just going to throw people through the loop.
3077370	3078490	This is the last week you can win.
3079891	3081533	Has he been four weeks?
3081693	3081913	Yes.
3082293	3083974	Oh, yes, this will be the fourth week.
3084435	3087437	Because Mona Lisa Overdrive had two weeks the first time because of B3.
3087457	3089759	Oh, we've got more people here.
3089879	3090359	Hello.
3090859	3091600	It's men.
3091760	3093261	Hello, boys and girls.
3093942	3094442	It's men.
3095023	3096304	Oh, sorry, I dropped your Triscuits.
3097104	3097804	It's men's?
3099525	3100966	We are the men's in this house.
3101526	3107668	Hey, the topic we were talking about before you guys got here, I know Matt maybe has something to contribute, because he used to play Evercrack.
3108329	3109729	We were just talking about that.
3109809	3115992	Funny, no, funny online gaming stories, and I already told the one about you telling people in Ragnarok you had SARS.
3116512	3117492	Yes.
3118773	3118933	Yes.
3119736	3122198	Oh, speaking of which, Jamie just asked me if I'm paying to play.
3122878	3126421	They just... Okay, we just spent like a half hour talking about Ragnarok, so make it quick.
3126521	3127242	It's going to be quick.
3127662	3132786	For those, if there's anybody who's interested or is playing, they did today shut off the servers to get ready for pay-to-play.
3132826	3133726	It did just come back up.
3134247	3139731	And instead of being 12,000 people on the server with lots of lag, there's 2,400 people on the server with no lag.
3139771	3143773	We had an update from Aaron who says 3,800 people are logged into Chaos right now.
3143954	3145074	Loki's a little less people.
3146275	3148457	Damn, it's... There's less people on you, Loki.
3148477	3148557	Damn.
3149591	3151332	I have lots of people on me.
3174088	3176469	who was going to give away the armor said just kidding and ran off.
3176689	3178129	Oh, no.
3178449	3180490	That wasn't funny though.
3181170	3184351	One of the classes has the ability to warp people places.
3184871	3191413	Well, when people got wins that they were going to be going pay to play, like 50 or more percent of the people who played the beta didn't like that.
3191793	3194514	So they started warping people to places where they can't get out of it.
3195574	3197735	And they did that to me, the Christmas Village.
3197755	3201336	I had a fly wing too, but it took me 10 minutes to realize I had one.
3201798	3207482	And so they were sitting there, and I took screen captures, and I was like, I'm going to report you guys to Gravity, and you're going to get kicked off the server.
3207522	3209163	Fifteen minutes ago called, your topic arrived.
3209843	3210424	I'm just kidding.
3210444	3211665	You know what?
3211785	3212505	I just got here.
3212685	3213746	I'm just kidding.
3214646	3216047	I am go-good-not-this.
3217428	3219590	Matt, do you have any Evercrack stories that are funny?
3220630	3220811	No.
3220951	3221571	One more little thing.
3221771	3222031	Okay.
3222111	3226975	I freaking got warped to five different locations in a row, and they sent me to Glass Time.
3227935	3228776	I hate Glass Time.
3228796	3230377	I hate Glass Time.
3232205	3233106	Eat Electric Death.
3234507	3237010	Yes, greatest video game quote ever.
3237831	3238131	Alright.
3239652	3240894	Guess what, boys and girls?
3243116	3245198	It's time for the Orange Lounge Cage Match.
3246759	3253546	This is where I put a song in, and Loki puts a song in, and Jamie puts a song in, and they do battle.
3254106	3256569	They get naked and roll around and romp with each other.
3258127	3264629	and the winning song chosen by your votes in the chat room goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.
3265109	3268670	So, let's start it off with the reigning champion, Loki's pick.
3269050	3277232	Three weeks, actually only two shows victorious, but since we had no show the weekend of B3, it's been victorious for three weeks now.
3277712	3284854	So this is the last time it can win, and this will be the very first four-week rotated song, if this won.
3285334	3285554	So...
3286334	3289217	Here's a clip of Loki's song.
3290238	3291059	You want to introduce us?
3292180	3297765	This is Don Davis and Juno Reactor with Mona Lisa Overdrive from the Matrix Reloaded movie.
3298646	3302489	And since it is last week's winner, you only get to hear a clip.
3302589	3303250	Sorry, kids.
3304071	3306353	So here's a clip of Mona Lisa Overdrive.
3399352	3403875	Then there's a clip of last week's winner, Mona Lisa Overdrive.
3404015	3404515	Beautiful.
3405115	3408317	All right, the next entry tonight comes from Jamie.
3408337	3410118	Mine's going to annoy the hell out of Matt.
3410579	3411279	Okay, so tell us.
3411299	3412320	It's something Speed Mix.
3412340	3413100	Uh-oh.
3413420	3414541	Oh, God, it's a Speed Mix.
3414741	3415541	Well, tell us about it.
3416082	3416782	It's September.
3416802	3418863	It's old school stuff.
3419083	3419644	It's old school.
3419664	3420264	Who's it by?
3420404	3420904	I don't remember.
3421105	3423686	DJ Speedo with September, the Speedo Mix.
3423886	3425327	I think I got this one from JB.
3425587	3426067	Oh, God.
3426668	3428729	But I like the song anyway because I like the original song.
3429537	3430158	Alright, sounds good.
3430218	3432100	So this is Jamie's pick for this week.
3432141	3435184	And since it's a new entry, you get to hear the whole five minute long version.
3435244	3435605	Here it is.
3436166	3438589	DJ Speedo with September, the Speedo Mix.
3438649	3440551	Jamie's pick for the cage match this week.
3440611	3440872	Enjoy.
3490117	3491658	Remember, it's when it's the time.
3491758	3493339	Remember, love will change in your mind.
3493379	3495060	Remember, while I'm taking the sound away.
3495140	3497601	Our hearts are ringing, looking out for what we're saying.
3497741	3499262	At the dance of the night.
3499302	3501503	Remember, how the stars all night away.
3619854	3620680	Thanks for watching!
3635078	3635919	DarkSakura.com
3678553	3679194	DarkSakura.com
3760030	3761751	DJ Speedo there with September.
3761791	3766335	That's DarkSakura's pick for the Sex-Tember.
3767055	3770818	I was about to leave the house, and I couldn't find a song.
3770838	3774481	So I picked September, because I like the song.
3774861	3775741	I like the original.
3775762	3776282	Uh-huh.
3776536	3781219	I like the speed mix okay, I give it an upper level 8, barely a 9.
3781560	3783281	Upper level 8, barely a 9 from Jamie.
3783561	3790186	Loki, I give it a 2 because it's a speed mix and I hate speed mixes and everything.
3790706	3791927	I hate speed mixes.
3792287	3795489	God damn it, it's not a new song, you just sped up the old one.
3795870	3796310	Stop it.
3797931	3803475	Um, I would give that song like, I don't know, okay, this is my problem with speed mixes.
3804690	3807831	DDR size, like a minute and a half, two minutes, they're awesome.
3807851	3810372	They're cool, they're fun, they're cheesy to dance to, they're great.
3810912	3811892	Five minutes long?
3812593	3813133	Joke's old.
3814133	3816674	So, if that were two minutes long, I'd give it like an eight.
3816734	3819655	But since it's five minutes long, I'm going to have it and give it a four.
3822556	3824117	But I do, I like the original too.
3825517	3826337	Yeah, the original was good.
3826578	3827538	I love the original.
3827958	3829939	I love the original, but no.
3831519	3831779	No.
3833200	3833520	All right.
3834085	3841945	Matt, the Ice Prince, or Ice Queen, whatever we're calling you We have the Rice Princess and the Ice Princess Yeah, Ice Princess works, I like that better than Ice Queen
3842526	3844047	I'm not that dramatic, bitch.
3844347	3844567	Anyway.
3846008	3847709	Yeah, no, I have to give that about a six.
3847749	3849230	I mean, Rob made a good point.
3849650	3851451	Five minutes is a little too long for a speed mix.
3852071	3858555	It just gets repetitive, so... Well, depends on how you're... Well, never mind.
3858655	3858935	Anyway.
3859315	3860356	Yeah, I give it a six.
3860376	3869861	The problem is it goes so fast that really you're listening to about 15 minutes worth of music in that little five minute, you know, spot, so... Loki makes a damn good point.
3870401	3871282	Listen up, everybody.
3872232	3873053	Irene, you have something to say?
3873213	3874294	Yeah, I agree.
3874734	3880318	I give it a 6 too, because I'm really burnt out on speed mixes, especially all the crap that you play on Orange Lounge.
3881019	3882800	Yeah, that you need to take off.
3883260	3885222	But yeah, 6, yeah, whatever.
3886102	3890205	Mr. Brad, there are only three good speed songs in this world.
3890546	3896810	Can't Stop Falling In Love, If You Were Here With Me Before The Beat, and the Aerosmith Jaded song.
3897130	3898992	If it's not that, it's not good, it's a 2.
3900242	3901983	No, it's a one.
3904305	3904585	What?
3906066	3909208	Yeah, there was a speed mix that won the cage match one time.
3910389	3911710	Yeah, it was heaven is a place on earth.
3912310	3916173	So, I think the general public would tend to disagree with you, Mr. Brad.
3918655	3920516	The general public doesn't matter.
3921697	3922818	Because they're all retards.
3922838	3923999	They don't play Ragnarok online.
3925940	3926841	Jamie knows what I'm talking about.
3927944	3929265	Anyway, can we get on to my pick now?
3929285	3930746	No, they don't need to play rock and roll.
3930766	3933887	My pick, my pick, my pick time.
3934728	3936029	My pick time, it's my pick time.
3936049	3937349	Fine, go, God.
3937369	3943953	Okay, who remembers, like, about three months ago when I put in a song by Kylie Minogue called Your Disco Needs You?
3945534	3946815	And everybody wanted to kill me?
3947295	3951478	Well, this is the Kylie song that people said I should have put in instead.
3952058	3957221	And this is, I'll admit it, it's a much better Kylie song, and if any Kylie song were to win the cage match, it should be this one.
3957822	3962126	And it's very cute, and it's very danceable, and it'll be great in a Pomadi game, and it's got a great video.
3962206	3964008	It's got a wonderful video to it.
3964849	3966170	But you can't see it, because it's radio.
3966210	3966471	Ha!
3967151	3969273	This is Kylie Minogue with Come Into My World.
3969313	3970054	I love this song.
3970114	3971575	This is my pick for this week's Big Red.
3971595	3972897	I love this song, and I hope you win.
3973918	3975059	Alright, here it is.
3975159	3975459	Enjoy.
4247264	4248205	All right, boys and girls.
4250106	4252827	Kylie Minogue with Come Into My World.
4253608	4254668	What did y'all think of that one?
4255729	4258210	Jamie's in the facilities right now, so we'll start with Irene.
4258910	4260091	Oh, I like Kylie.
4260851	4262072	That was a pretty good one.
4262132	4263253	I give it an 8.
4263333	4266474	I'd rather hear In Your Eyes, but that one's pretty good.
4266754	4267355	Maybe another time.
4267395	4269436	In another three months, I'll do In Your Eyes.
4269936	4270276	Yeah.
4270316	4270616	All right.
4270636	4271977	What are you giving us?
4271997	4272157	1 to 10?
4272257	4272157	8?
4272277	4274718	You're giving an 8?
4275019	4275319	An 8, yeah.
4275459	4275719	All right.
4278169	4279269	Whoever grabs the mic next.
4280430	4280710	Jamie.
4281070	4281230	Eight.
4281650	4282891	Brad.
4284251	4291974	I give it an eight, too, because I like the song a lot, but... I'm not a huge Kylie fan.
4294055	4294375	I know.
4294496	4294816	Fine.
4295036	4295336	Kill me.
4295376	4295996	Kick me out of here.
4296997	4297457	Be gone!
4297557	4298817	Just beat me up now!
4299117	4299598	Please!
4299838	4300318	Ice Queen.
4303440	4304240	Ice Slut, Ice Slut.
4304540	4306381	Well, no, that was only last night.
4308662	4309142	Oh, boy.
4309622	4310042	Anyway.
4311043	4317605	Anyway, if that was anything like the other song that you were playing, I was going to have to tell somebody to go get a rope so we could hang you by your freaking toes from the ceiling.
4318065	4319085	But, no, that was a good one.
4319106	4320026	I like that song a lot.
4320266	4320966	I give that a nine.
4322367	4322727	Excellent.
4322827	4323167	Loki.
4325248	4329049	Wow, you know, that sounded like every other fucking song that she sings.
4329969	4331890	Gee, um... Hmm...
4332735	4339237	Since I've heard it before, you know, I'm going to have to say that I'm going to give it a zero because it sucks ass.
4340118	4343039	And, no, actually, no, Kylie's alright, but that song sucks.
4343159	4346060	Seriously, she has done much better stuff than that song.
4346660	4355703	I actually have to decrease mine, okay, because last weekend when Maren and I had lunch in San Francisco, they played nothing but Kylie Minogue.
4356643	4361105	And then I was there the weekend before while all of you were at the tourney and I went to go get lunch.
4362230	4365451	and it was when Megumi-chan and I were having lunch and they were playing Kylie.
4365972	4368653	So I dropped my note 6.
4369153	4371414	Just out of bitterness.
4371434	4377457	I would like to retort Loki's argument and say that that song sounds nothing like I should be so lucky in love.
4378357	4380838	I should be so lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.
4385460	4385780	Come on.
4385800	4387301	It doesn't sound like the locomotion.
4387421	4387701	Anyway.
4388630	4390091	I give it a 10, it's fabulous.
4391613	4392494	Alright, here we go.
4392994	4394055	You can send your votes now.
4394115	4396798	Here's a quick recap of the songs in tonight's cage match.
4397138	4402503	Pick number one, last week's winner, three weeks winner, Mona Lisa Overdrive from the Matrix 2.
4408168	4410070	That's a shitty clip of the song, I'm gonna play a different clip.
4418337	4425267	Alright, pick number two, DJ Speedo with September And pick number three, Kylie Minogue, Come Into My World
4438718	4440239	Voting is now open.
4440519	4443122	You're going to send those over to private message to me.
4443622	4445584	I'm Sky in the chat room.
4445924	4446465	You say that again.
4446485	4448106	And you send those over private MSG.
4448627	4449868	No, no, wait.
4449888	4450349	What, Matt?
4450469	4451770	Come into my eye.
4452130	4455714	Oh, boy.
4456494	4458857	And if you want to send in your vote, you've got to get in our chat room.
4458897	4459677	Head on over to www.
4460760	4462701	Don't forget about our LiveJournal community
4485987	4487088	for those of you familiar with LiveJournal.
4487388	4488489	Put us on your friends list.
4488669	4488989	Yes.
4489029	4490530	Show the world you love Orange Lounge.
4492191	4492511	All right.
4492711	4494732	Ooh, my screen is filling up with votes for the cage match.
4494752	4496073	I'm going to have to go count those in a little bit.
4497014	4500636	In the meantime, what else do you kids want to talk about today?
4500856	4502277	Do we have a sim update for Loki?
4502657	4503698	Loki's been awfully quiet.
4503718	4504639	I think Kylie scared him.
4504679	4506460	So let's wake him up with a sim update.
4507340	4510782	You know, I want to know where my freaking Dancy Stage Party Edition stuff went.
4510822	4512263	It's like disappeared off my computer.
4512483	4512864	That's weird.
4513004	4513224	Anyway...
4514251	4519074	Um, there's a new, uh, CVS, um, update for Stepmania.
4519314	4521455	It was just updated yesterday, I believe.
4522116	4522816	Um, pretty nice.
4522896	4524037	I was playing with that earlier.
4524317	4527238	They've got a bunch of new modifiers they added in there, which is pretty cool.
4527359	4529680	And then they've also, um, done some other things.
4529700	4532581	They added a few things where you can adjust the pitch of the song.
4533082	4535123	Um, before it used to be limited just to .07, or .7.
4535383	4538725	Now you can go all the way down to .3, which makes the song sound...
4539561	4558759	Really bad, but if you really want to practice or something, that's pretty good for you And it loads really nice, so go check that one out And if you haven't checked out, there's a new DWI version, 2.49 or whatever But I don't play DWI because it's inferior, so go check that one out too Now as for other updates, let's see here
4560066	4569692	Um, check my money sims, because, uh, Uber, or, Utterdude, or whatever, that guy is releasing a lot of cool stuff, and pretty much all of his step files kick ass, and they're just really playable, so go play those.
4570473	4580299	Um, and, uh, other than that, I have the second most, um, DWIs on the internet, other than, uh, Shoei, which has, you know, 5,000, but I have 3,000 and something now, so, yay!
4581259	4585602	I would have 5,000 if I put every single one that he has in there, because I have all his, um...
4586366	4588146	I was telling Cage Match votes, I'm sorry.
4588186	4589006	Hello, show.
4589046	4590827	We're talking about money, go away.
4590847	4592267	What about money?
4592287	4592427	Yeah.
4592447	4592647	Yeah.
4616616	4620797	Sniff Hello, we're trying to do a show here, what's up?
4621397	4622797	If you're going to say it, say it on the show, what's up?
4623257	4623457	What?
4625018	4633859	Shut up Bitch, please Your hair is sticking up Okay, Irene, what would you like for McDonald's?
4634239	4641701	I'd like a chicken sandwich and some fries Okay, so maybe I'll just get the meal, it's the fries and the drink and stuff I'll take your car, right?
4641961	4643421	Whatever's cheaper, yeah, you can take my car
4644079	4645239	Okay, I gotta go get cash back first.
4645259	4647240	Can you get me one of those Cheesecake McFlurries while you're out?
4647260	4647640	Hey, fuck you.
4647680	4651561	See, this is why I need things on the radio, because I need food from McDonald's too.
4652401	4654822	Our listeners really want to hear about the food we provide.
4654902	4655662	I think they do.
4655922	4656202	No.
4659203	4661863	Listeners, you care about what we're getting at McDonald's.
4661943	4662924	I say we have a vote.
4662964	4664604	What do you think we should get at McDonald's?
4664704	4668425	No, don't get them mixed up with the K-Med votes.
4668765	4672326	For a limited time only, they have the Strawberry Cheesecake McFlurries.
4672864	4673825	For a limited time.
4674085	4675105	For a limited time only.
4675125	4678928	That's okay, because I'm just going to go eat a sandwich at my house after the show.
4680128	4681329	You're going to go eat a sandwich?
4681349	4682170	Fine, I don't eat.
4684431	4684711	Okay.
4684731	4687933	So you're going to give me that McFlurry if I give you money?
4690114	4691335	The strawberry cheesecake one?
4691995	4694477	If they don't have the strawberry cheesecake one, you can get me an Oreo one.
4697178	4697679	Tee hee.
4700800	4701561	Boom shakalaka.
4702659	4704480	Thank you, Bradley.
4704860	4705700	You're my friend.
4706261	4706801	Okay, hi.
4711423	4712904	See, we already got a vote.
4713284	4715625	We got a vote for double quarter pounder with cheese meal.
4716185	4717305	That's a royale with cheese.
4717566	4718506	Is everybody leaving?
4723348	4724649	What are you getting frustrated about?
4725569	4728710	I'm missing step files and my programs just disappeared on my taskbar.
4729671	4729931	Damn it.
4734518	4734918	My, my.
4736459	4739081	Irene, are you guys going to do Orange Crush tonight?
4739581	4743464	Okay, that's something to look forward to in the next hour or so.
4743484	4744644	We'll do Mad Libs next week.
4746205	4747206	You want to do a list list tonight?
4747226	4748507	We haven't done one in forever.
4748587	4749307	We haven't done one in forever.
4749327	4750228	It's the first one of the house.
4750488	4753490	Let's do a list list when we get back, since there will only be four of us here, right?
4754070	4755891	I'm taking a nap.
4755911	4756812	What list list topic?
4757192	4758213	I'll think of one.
4758726	4760287	I will solicit ideas from the chat room.
4760327	4762008	We have no idea what to do on Listless tonight.
4763009	4764430	Top of cool anime in the world.
4766592	4767573	I'd have to research that.
4767853	4768653	Top of cool anime.
4768673	4771135	Haven't we done best anime before?
4771155	4771756	No, we never have.
4771796	4774978	How about worst Bomani game?
4775218	4776619	That'd be Marshall Beat.
4776639	4777820	There's probably not enough.
4778761	4780462	We could do worst video game.
4782043	4783024	Did we do worst video game?
4783384	4783684	Yes.
4784305	4784745	Let's see.
4785806	4785906	Hmm...
4789573	4793496	No, I'm not getting suggestions for our listless segment.
4795397	4795878	No.
4797759	4801522	G4 can kiss my balls, because I was watching this show on there.
4801862	4804184	But Rob, you might get SARS.
4804564	4805124	I know, I might.
4805605	4806806	I was watching this show on there today.
4806846	4808447	What was that, the 10 play or something like that?
4810548	4810928	Which one?
4810948	4812049	The 10 play.
4812630	4814351	What was that show, the 10 spot, 10 play?
4814847	4818850	Oh, yeah, Timplay, I think that's what it's called or something like that.
4819050	4820231	It's a top ten show.
4821071	4826836	Okay, and they were doing top ten most, like, changing video games of all time.
4826856	4828897	Like, video games that change the scene of all time.
4828957	4830638	Arcade games that change the scene of all time.
4830718	4830878	What?
4831459	4833820	Why is Pikachu humping Friendship Bear's arm?
4834421	4834901	I don't know.
4835041	4835462	Anyway.
4836622	4839985	Anyway, so they were doing, like, the top ten games that changed arcades.
4840025	4841646	And number one, of course, was Pac-Man.
4842173	4844554	Number 10, this was cool, was Final Furlong.
4847054	4849174	But number 8 was Dance Dance Revolution.
4849815	4850215	Oh, yay.
4850295	4856156	But fucking G4 TV, when they were talking about Dance Dance Revolution, guess what they showed a picture of?
4856236	4857196	What?
4857236	4859156	3D, uh, Easy to Dancer.
4859837	4860297	Easy to Dancer.
4860317	4861997	What stupid fucks they are.
4862117	4864558	They are stupid British.
4865378	4866498	Um, but actually they...
4867580	4875086	They had actually rounded up, um, they called, no, they said number whatever it was was Dance Dance Revolution, but they were actually talking about all the Bomani games, which is even worse.
4877708	4877988	Anyway.
4878068	4878689	This one's loud.
4878949	4882732	Um, okay, here's some suggestions from the chat room for tonight's list list.

5463873	5464653	Oh, you know what?
5465317	5465397	What?
5465417	5465577	Prison.
5465597	5465798	Prison!
5465838	5465978	Prison!
5488786	5489806	So that's why rent's cheap.
5490086	5497429	We're next to the dam, which is a big terrorist target, and we're right on the other side of the prison, so if there's ever a prison break... Next week's Orange Lounge will be hosted from my house.

5512474	5514755	It sounds like one of the animals from Happy Tree Friends.
5516519	5518019	And then they say it sounds like Menchie.
5519320	5520160	Menchie flavor.
5520520	5520680	Mmm.
5521620	5522521	Mmm, delicious.
5523061	5525802	So, wow, it's just the three of us here now.
5526002	5526762	Yes, it's quiet.
5526862	5527702	It's weird.
5527762	5529083	You should have been here this week.
5530083	5530503	Huh?
5530563	5531743	Martin Chung should have been here this week.
5533304	5534244	Less crowded.
5534804	5535304	Yeah.
5535344	5537565	Less chances to be claustrophobia-ed.
5538625	5539445	Or catch SARS.
5539665	5542046	Or catch SARS, yeah, because I still have it.
5542086	5542946	Remember brain tumor?
5543246	5543426	Yeah.
5543467	5544307	All at the same time?
5544587	5545107	Yeah, it's awful.
5547830	5551971	Do we want to talk shit about any of the other people that are on this show usually?
5552011	5554151	Well, you know what?
5554672	5555612	That Brad.
5556092	5556812	Oh, that Brad.
5557012	5559632	Congesting the server all by himself that I don't even play on.
5559652	5560453	He's so skinny.
5561133	5561953	Yeah, what's up with that?
5562013	5562873	And that ice queen.
5562893	5563493	What a fag.
5564433	5565753	And rice princess.
5566134	5567734	I haven't seen her eat rice in a year.
5568474	5569934	How dare she call herself that?
5572415	5572995	That reminds me.
5573035	5574135	I have to use our rice cooker.
5575785	5576305	You know what?
5576625	5576845	Huh?
5577185	5578546	Dare the shit and it's time to flush.
5582767	5583668	What was that?
5585168	5585968	I hate being sick.
5585988	5587569	God, let's give me good stars again.
5587769	5589029	Every time I laugh, I cough.
5595332	5597072	I'm going to beat that thing senseless.
5598152	5598753	Give it to me.
5598773	5598893	No.
5599173	5599313	No.
5603396	5603756	Oh, I know.
5604197	5605638	I thought of a fun thing we could do.
5606178	5611382	Since we were kind of making fun of G4 before the break, I thought maybe we could take a look at the list.
5611402	5614084	And this can be like an ongoing thing because there's a lot to talk about here.
5614524	5618967	We could talk about G4's list that they got together with the Entertainment Weekly.
5620909	5622450	I'll just shut up and let that thing talk.
5626293	5628074	I had to do the elementary school trick to make it work.
5629280	5630241	Don't do it!
5630381	5632321	Yeah, I gotta take that thing away.
5632482	5633042	You see this?
5633082	5633642	It's mine now.
5633822	5634602	This is mine now.
5636503	5636823	Alright.
5641005	5643906	They have an ass shot for the bad touch, that's sweet.
5645147	5646207	Is that the official background?
5647948	5648408	Yes, it is.
5648428	5651149	Do they have the background for Can't Get You Out of My Head?
5652830	5653870	I'm just curious what it looks like.
5657072	5657732	Oh, that's lame.
5659465	5660605	That's super lame.
5661926	5663586	I can't get the SARS out of my head.
5663706	5663986	Anyway.
5664526	5664846	Oh, yes.
5665247	5666327	Our topic at hand.
5666447	5666807	SARS.
5666927	5669928	We're going to talk about G4's list of the 100 greatest games of all time.
5670368	5672509	That they got together with Entertainment Weekly.
5672829	5673869	And we're going to make fun of it.
5675729	5676570	Oh, you're going to go blow your nose.
5677470	5686272	First off, if you happen to be watching G4 any time of the day, no matter what day, you're going to catch this goddamn show because they play it all the time.
5687192	5687753	All the time.
5688513	5688953	And they suck.
5691246	5697468	Alright, so now we're going to talk about the 100 greatest video games of all time, according to a bunch of schmoes.
5700429	5702130	DDR is on the list, I might add.
5703210	5708072	DDR is on the list, so if you don't know where it clocks in, listen to us, we'll tell you where it clocks in.
5708092	5709552	This is like a throne.
5709952	5710412	Here we go.
5710973	5712413	And you're sitting on it, don't you feel special?
5712773	5716094	Okay, so let's get everybody's thoughts and opinions on the top 100 games here.
5716114	5717535	100 on their list.
5717975	5718655	Missile Command.
5719115	5719416	Yay.
5719876	5720756	Missile Command was cool.
5721448	5728129	I have that on the 2600, 5200, a bunch of other things, Intellivision Yeah, there's no Scoobman 2000, I think Whatever that was Nice, please Sam, moving on, alright?
5750009	5752250	Number 98, Frogger.
5754552	5755513	A Konami game, yes?
5755893	5756113	Yeah.
5756733	5758655	It always makes me think of that episode of Seinfeld.
5758775	5762177	I'm not even that big a fan of Seinfeld, but I will never forget that episode of Seinfeld with the Frogger.
5762197	5762977	I don't think I've watched it.
5763998	5766720	It's the greatest... I've only seen one episode of Seinfeld, and it was the last one.
5767000	5767760	You know why I went?
5768181	5772543	Because it was at the Red Lion Convention Center by the mall, and they gave out free food.
5775505	5777126	That's so ghetto fabulous.
5779488	5782190	The only other episode, I remember three episodes of Seinfeld.
5782210	5784012	I remember the Gradius one.
5784632	5785973	I'm sorry, not Gradius.
5786874	5787875	I remember the Frogger one.
5788815	5793599	I remember the masturbation one, where they make the contest about who can go the longest without masturbating.
5794120	5799083	And then I remember the one where they go to a Chinese restaurant and they dare Elaine to steal an egg roll.
5800204	5801485	Anyway, yeah.
5801745	5803747	I remember the one where they all died.
5804187	5805008	Oh wait, I dreamed that.
5806569	5807770	Number ninety-seven.
5808775	5809636	Secret of Mana.
5811337	5812218	Why so low on the list?
5812238	5813118	It needs to be higher.
5813339	5813879	I know.
5814479	5815020	Fuck that.
5815540	5817001	At least it wasn't Secret of Evermore.
5817242	5817862	Question!
5817962	5819784	Keep going.
5821045	5824467	Now, what do you think about Second Densetsu 3?
5824867	5826309	Why didn't they ever release that here?
5826349	5826809	They're going to.
5827369	5828090	Are they?
5828490	5829331	When?
5829391	5832553	After they released the first Second Densetsu, which was released as Final Fantasy Adventure.
5832693	5834815	Is that what that Sword of Mana is that they're doing?
5836136	5837897	Sword of Mana is just Second Densetsu 3?
5838098	5838438	First one.
5839386	5840086	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5860173	5868215	Number 96 on their list, M-U-L-E, which is a game a lot of people probably don't remember, but if you did ever play it, this game was a shit.
5868235	5874597	It was one of the first multiplayer games that was just downright innovative for its time.
5874797	5876277	It's well-deserved mention on the list.
5876297	5877117	You said downright.
5879038	5882038	Number 95, Golden Axe.
5882939	5883659	You know what's funny?
5884239	5888200	Golden Axe the Duel was the first game I played on the Saturn, and it was an important one.
5888871	5898938	You know what I remember about Golden Axe was the ending where it showed the people in the arcade and the heroes jumped out of the screen and trampled all the people in the arcade.
5899098	5899739	That was great.
5899799	5901720	That was the best part about Golden Axe was the ending.
5902821	5905102	Number 94 is a game I've never fucking heard of.
5905162	5907164	It's IL2 Stromovic.
5907664	5908345	Okay, whatever.
5908365	5908685	Whatever.
5908705	5909305	93, Joust.
5912035	5915396	Joust is like one of the games I play on Alter Pave all the time.
5915416	5915916	You know what?
5915936	5919297	They had the Nintendo version, which was Balloon Fight.
5921418	5922138	Remember Balloon Fight?
5923258	5923398	No.
5923598	5925239	We who play Animal Crossing should have Balloon Fight.
5925259	5925939	Yes, I know Balloon Fight.
5926519	5928279	I'm just being difficult.
5928299	5929300	92, Super Star Wars.
5930020	5932220	Huh, yeah.
5932240	5932820	You ever play it?
5933321	5933421	Yeah.
5933441	5934201	It's okay.
5934221	5934661	It's okay.
5935768	5937649	I don't think it should be on the top 100 of videos of all time.
5937669	5939729	Super Star Wars is great because of the debug mode.
5940129	5941230	You could, like, skip levels.
5941930	5943070	I didn't know there was a debug mode.
5943190	5946271	There is for all three of the Star Wars games on the Super Nintendo.
5946391	5947371	Well, I'll be damned.
5947751	5949192	I'll have to bring over my SNES one day.
5949752	5950032	Why?
5950552	5951452	So you can play all the games.
5951472	5952413	Can we play ActRaiser?
5953013	5953613	Yeah, I have it.
5954113	5956374	Because ActRaiser is, like, my favorite Super Nintendo game ever.
5956394	5957274	I wonder what's on this list.
5957314	5957774	I don't even know.
5957994	5958414	Keep going.
5958915	5959955	Keep going!
5960015	5960435	Bye, Hunter.
5961563	5965806	You know they're going to make a movie out of Spy Hunter?
5966126	5966886	That'd be kind of cool.
5967767	5968307	Yes, Loki.
5969268	5970108	And guess who's in it?
5970669	5970889	Who?
5971009	5971649	The Rock!
5972610	5973510	No shit.
5973590	5975431	God, it's going to be awful.
5976192	5979914	Well, did you ever play... I wish we could, like, spray oil on his limousine.
5980054	5982916	Did you ever play Spy Hunter, though, that was on the PS2?
5983756	5984417	That was pretty rad.
5985037	5985497	No, I never did.
5985817	5986398	It was pretty cool.
5987558	5987679	Uh, 90...
5989212	5990953	Crash Bandicoot 3 warped.
5991233	5991694	Gag!
5992354	5993195	I hate Crash Bandicoot.
5993235	5993875	It looks retarded.
5994496	5997458	I don't know if that's the Crash Bandicoot game I would have put it there.
5997598	6000099	I feel really ripped because I bought... What was that game?
6000159	6001080	It's Crash Bandicoot.
6001100	6003201	It's like Crash Bandicoot's answer to Mario Party.
6003522	6004222	What was it called?
6004642	6005183	Crash Party?
6005383	6005983	Crash Party.
6006263	6007024	It's awful.
6007644	6009025	I wish I would have just bought Mario Party.
6009065	6009746	I wanted Sonic Party.
6010006	6010206	Huh?
6010546	6011707	I wanted the Sonic Party game.
6011767	6012247	I have it.
6013288	6013668	Somewhere.
6013808	6014229	Is it okay?
6014629	6015189	It's okay.
6015269	6017451	It's kind of... I couldn't figure it out, but I'm lazy.
6017471	6017551	Okay.
6018277	6019598	I have no attention span whatsoever.
6020158	6022360	Uh, 89, Castle Wolfenstein.
6022820	6023140	Yeah.
6024021	6026583	Now, is that referring to the original on the Apple IIe?
6026643	6027243	I think not.
6027603	6028644	Is it referring to the original?
6030666	6031766	I watched this stupid thing.
6031966	6034868	It's the original one they're talking about, not Wolfenstein 3D.
6036249	6037230	Alright, fine.
6037270	6040592	So we have to make, uh, give a nod to the original.
6041133	6045616	I wouldn't put the original Wolfenstein above, like, M-U-L-E, but whatever.
6045976	6049037	No, it was all about playing Doom and going to the Wolfenstein level by warping there.
6049558	6049878	Sheesh.
6051438	6053639	Uh, number 88, FIFA Soccer 2003.
6053720	6055060	Whatever.
6055220	6058442	Whatever, we don't talk about sports on this show.
6058462	6059362	87 was Battlezone.
6060783	6061763	Battlezone was cool.
6061783	6062443	Remember the tank?
6063644	6064484	You don't remember Battlezone?
6064504	6065225	I didn't play Battlezone.
6065285	6067366	It was a vector game and you were in the tank?
6067466	6068266	Was it on the Vectrex?
6069126	6070007	I think it might have been.
6070067	6070947	Because I didn't play the Vectrex.
6071007	6071527	It was Atari.
6071828	6072688	It was Atari's game.
6072968	6074169	You know we've been looking for a Vectrex.
6074529	6074789	Really?
6074809	6074889	Yeah.
6075583	6076184	I wouldn't doubt it.
6077124	6076184	86.
6077225	6079326	Oh, it smells like fabric softener.
6079406	6079926	Oh, no wonder.
6080307	6082108	And thank God this game made the list.
6082748	6084510	86 was Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo.
6084750	6085170	Amen.
6085991	6088072	They're supposed to have... No, that was Gem Fighter.
6088733	6089753	Not Gem, but Pocket Fighter.
6089774	6091395	They have a second one out now.
6091535	6093396	When are they going to release a new version of Puzzle Fighter?
6093676	6095237	That's the game they need to take online.
6095297	6095818	Forget DDR.
6095838	6096799	You know what's awesome?
6096859	6100641	I have Puzzle Fighter, the one that's on the Dreamcast.
6100801	6102963	That was awesome because there's like a columns mode in it.
6104230	6106212	As well as another type of mode in there.
6107173	6108293	It's just like three different modes.
6108414	6109494	XYZ mode is awesome.
6109514	6113578	Plus it had the Sakura vocal song in it.
6113598	6114278	85, Prince of Persia.
6115399	6116400	God, I hate that game.
6116620	6122045	I know, Prince of Persia was so like... It's an ad for all over your old gaming magazines to this day.
6122065	6122465	Oh my god.
6122825	6125107	And how many freaking systems was that game on?
6125447	6125888	All of them.
6126308	6126728	All of them.
6126928	6130531	You could not... If you owned a game system of anything, you could get Prince of Persia.
6130551	6132133	84 was Asteroids.
6132173	6132293	Yeah.
6132313	6132393	Yeah.
6135543	6137584	Next!
6137604	6138805	83, Daytona USA.
6139125	6140325	Daytona!
6140585	6141806	I never even played that.
6143487	6144707	What do you love about Daytona, Loki?
6145608	6154312	It's fun, and a lot of the arcades, especially the ones like in Reno and stuff, they've got like 16 machines hooked together, so it's like one hell of a race.
6155332	6159314	Normally they're like huge lap settings, so you're like racing about 12 people and stuff.
6159514	6161595	I have nightmares, though, about that game for one reason.
6162196	6164777	I worked in an arcade where they never turned off the attract.
6165492	6165992	for that game.
6166612	6169453	All day I'm going, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
6169593	6171174	I'm like, oh God, make it stop.
6172134	6174195	You know, there was actually a really funny penny arcade to that.
6175055	6176656	I don't remember where exactly it was.
6176716	6178076	One of the older ones from a couple years ago.
6178096	6189060	I remember Gabe, but the other guy was sitting down at the computer and Gabe walks up and goes, do-do-do-do-do-do-daytona.
6189120	6190621	And the other guy reaches up and grabs out his heart.
6190821	6191881	He goes, ah!
6191901	6192321	Like that.
6194002	6194482	Oh my Lord.
6195878	6196859	82, Goulds and Ghosts.

6212854	6213955	Hey, Yamaoka music.
6214775	6215216	Right on.
6215956	6217198	How far do we want to take this list?
6217238	6217818	Let's keep going.
6217978	6218379	Keep going?
6218399	6218919	Keep it rolling!
6218939	6219700	79, King's Quest.
6221676	6221976	Next.
6222176	6223717	King's Quest was awesome.
6223997	6225237	This should have been in the top ten.
6225677	6227498	I'm sorry, King's Quest should have been in the top ten.
6227878	6229899	It's one of the most innovative video games of all time.
6229919	6232299	Maniac Mansion better be on that list.
6232919	6234320	Maniac Mansion better be on that list.
6234380	6234640	Next.
6235260	6235920	I don't know if it is.
6237781	6238961	This freaking dolts.
6239341	6242782	But if there had been no King's Quest, there would have never been Maniac Mansion.
6244623	6246063	Whatever.
6246323	6247004	78, Defender.
6247644	6250205	Okay, next.

6251784	6253104	Yes, oh my god, yes.
6253805	6255925	I love Saturn Bomberman and I could not find a copy.
6256365	6257445	Actually, you know what was really good?
6258446	6262707	The Bomberman games on the, um, on the, uh, TurboGrafx.
6263267	6264627	Bomberman 93, Bomberman 94.
6265087	6265367	Uh-huh.
6265647	6266288	Those were good.
6267208	6270029	Okay, we had a request in the chat room to just skip ahead to 50.
6270189	6270469	Okay.
6270609	6272309	You want me to read the rest of these really fast?
6272469	6272749	Yeah.
6272769	6278071	Okay, give your, Jamie, you're going to give your one word reaction to each of these games as I name them off, okay?
6278191	6278451	Okay.

6298342	6299603	The one that's gonna piss you off.
6300163	6301843	It's fucking Puzzle Bobble, you bitches!
6302404	6304024	No, no, I'm almost positive.
6304064	6307245	Aren't they talking about... Oh, no, they are talking about Puzzle Bobble in that case.
6307385	6307766	Bitches.
6308006	6308306	Bitches.
6308326	6309086	But I have it on Saturn.
6310657	6311358	Loki, you saw it.
6311378	6312739	Were they talking about Puzzle Bobble or the other one?
6314800	6315020	What?
6316321	6316861	Forget it.
6317221	6317762	Forget it.
6317782	6319803	They're talking about Puzzle Bobble or Bust a Move 2.
6319903	6322605	Were they talking about Groove or what?

6465690	6480659	Because Retards made this list God And then this one, NHL 93 What the fuck ever At 43 42, Quake 2 Hey, Quake 2 has a Gachapon patch to it 41, Deus Ex Whatever
6481694	6483015	40, Dance Dance Revolution.
6483175	6484195	Yay!
6485895	6491237	Why so high?
6491257	6493818	39, beating out Dance Dance Revolution, Mortal Kombat 2.
6496519	6497479	Actually, I like Mortal Kombat.
6497499	6498059	Pertality.
6498579	6506422	I like Mortal Kombat 2 because I like playing on the beta kits where you can do the infinite juggles and float and start off your game against Shao Kahn.
6509537	6510257	Where the hell was I?
6510537	6511438	I was in high school.
6512419	6513739	38, Sonic the Hedgehog.
6516241	6516741	37, SimCity.
6517922	6519103	Okay.
6519123	6520424	36, Tom Clancy, Splinter Cell.
6520464	6522645	Whatever, I hate Tom Clancy games.
6522665	6523106	35, Battlefield 1942.
6523146	6525347	Whatever.
6525367	6528069	34, ooh, this is a good pick, Ultima 4, Quest of the Avatar.
6528569	6529710	Okay.
6530010	6530951	33, Duke Nukem 3D.
6531891	6534233	Your face, your ass, what's the difference?
6534253	6534953	32, Tekken 2.
6535534	6537335	Hey, Tekken 2 had June in it.
6538811	6565358	31, Diablo 2 30, Mario Kart 64 29, Medal of Honor, Allied Assault 28, Galaga 27, Monkey Island 2, Lee Chuck's Revenge 26, Command and Conquer, Red Alert 25, Star Wars X, Wing Alliance 24, Castlevania, Symphony of the Night Oh my god, yes
6567364	6582309	23, Metal Gear Solid 22, Resident Evil 21, EverQuest Now that the others are back, we can slow this down a little bit to really rant about the top 20.
6583150	6587111	So, I know Brad has a few things he wants to say about some of the ones he heard just coming in the door.
6590352	6590652	Brad?
6592133	6593113	What is this big thing?
6593692	6597174	This, by the way, is G4 Entertainment Weekly's list of top 100 games of all time.
6597194	6609842	Okay, I've read so many of these lists over the years, and I already know when they do these top 100 things, that they get really lazy, and they kind of just... Because you can't really concentrate on every little thing, so they just start splashing games here and there because they don't know where to put them.
6610443	6621550	My opinion about some of these games being at like 24, 25, whatever it was, Castlevania Symphony of the Night, you know, in my opinion, should be up there in the top 5 at least, but I haven't read what their other top 19 or 18 or 20 is, so I don't know.
6623484	6624785	Why they're thinking these are their games.
6624965	6627467	Do they have explanations for why these games should be in the top 20?
6627587	6629388	If you watch the show, but we're not endorsing that.
6630669	6630909	Good.
6631389	6631690	Okay.
6632690	6636693	Well, as I name off these top 20... Your solid should also be up in the top 5, but whatever.
6636813	6641076	As I name off these top 20, you can tell us if they were deserving, Brad.
6641116	6644158	You can be the critic on if they're deserving of being in the top 20.
6644398	6644798	Okay, Brad?
6645959	6646840	Where'd the ice queen go?
6647620	6648321	Oh, okay.
6648801	6648981	Okay.
6652031	6652751	All right, here we go.
6653011	6654192	Oh, I don't need a quarter.
6656453	6657273	Here we go, kids.
6658093	6660434	Number 20, Super Metroid.
6661415	6662335	Dude, God, yes.
6663095	6664216	Number 20, Super Metroid.
6665476	6672779	Definitely deserving of being in the top 20, but I don't know if it should be at the lowest of the top 20.
6672819	6675740	I don't know what the other games are, so... Excellent game, though.
6675800	6676500	Definitely should be in the top 20.
6676540	6676600	19, Ms.
6676620	6676760	Pac-Man.
6676780	6677881	What...
6682762	6686163	If you're talking of all time, come on, Ms.
6686183	6687564	Pac-Man, of all time.
6688685	6688865	No.
6689305	6689525	Yes.
6689585	6690086	I'm sorry.
6690166	6690346	Yes.
6690906	6691606	Deserving of top 20.
6691646	6691866	Ms.
6691906	6697229	Pac-Man has so little gameplay comparing to something like Super Metroid.
6697870	6700971	It should be in the top 100, but maybe like at 99.
6702172	6702792	That's sad.
6703212	6704973	If you were 10 years older, you would not say that.
6705534	6706014	What the fuck?
6706374	6707475	I remember when it came out.
6707515	6707775	I know.
6708502	6712044	I'm saying, but if that was the game that everybody was playing in the arcades, like, now it's... It doesn't matter!
6712665	6717007	The game itself, as far as gameplay is concerned, that's the reason why we play video games, is because they're fun.
6717387	6717748	And Ms.
6717768	6722690	Pac-Man is not nearly as fun as something that has as much gameplay as Symphony of the Night, or Super Metroid.
6722971	6727173	I don't care if it's, oh, it brings you back to your past, or whatever, it's still not as fun.
6727193	6729535	I don't think it has anything to do with that.
6729815	6732536	If that's what it does to me, then you're playing video games for the wrong reason, in my opinion.
6732556	6733617	Yeah, but do you own a magazine?
6733637	6735078	I don't think so, so, huh!
6736359	6736879	And I will.
6737659	6738980	And it'll be very Nazi-ish.
6740221	6740521	No Ms.
6740541	6741261	Pac-Man for you.
6742582	6743743	I'd say it'd be Pac-Man.
6744604	6746765	Number... 18.
6747305	6748026	Soul Calibur.
6749627	6749847	Yes.
6750087	6750908	Soul Calibur, yes.
6751708	6754270	But you can't forget, though, Soul Edge.
6755951	6757252	Which is not on the list, I can tell you.
6757552	6764397	I think the reason why... I think the reason why they would put that up there as far as... Because Soul Calibur... They're probably talking about the console version.
6765017	6765978	It was kind of a...
6766909	6773051	It kind of pushed the fighting game on the console to, like, it pushed the envelope on it.
6773091	6774711	It gave you a lot more extra features.
6774771	6776992	It was kind of one of the first things, the big ones, to do that.
6777432	6781854	And Soul Edge was a great game on the console, but Soul Calibur really pushed it to the limit.
6782714	6788276	One thing to consider also, when they brought out Soul Calibur on the Dreamcast, the graphics were better than the arcade version.
6789376	6791437	Which is like, had never been done before.
6793037	6795998	Exactly, and that's probably one of the reasons why it's up there.
6797878	6807665	This is going to get an interesting reaction.
6807685	6808345	17, Tomb Raider.
6810767	6818573	Okay, I hate Tomb Raider, but it needs to be somewhere up on the list because it did start a new kind of genre.
6819153	6823076	I mean, there were other games kind of like it, but it was the one that kind of got accepted for...
6824301	6825482	starting this new genre again.
6825582	6827043	The big-breasted action hero!
6827303	6827883	Exactly!
6828463	6829504	Matt knows what I'm talking about.
6831125	6833626	No, I think... I want Stripperella the game.
6834487	6835327	Hold on, hold on.
6835467	6839730	As silly as Matt's kind of being joking, it's kind of true.
6840550	6850716	A big-breasted, like a female who kicked ass in a video game and became like an icon, basically like the logo for the PlayStation for a while was Laura Croft.
6850976	6852497	I mean, I hate the game, but...
6853818	6861060	It did do something huge to... And that probably sounds hypocritical because I said it like Ms.
6861100	6861540	Pac-Man.
6861940	6862720	Because it's not fun.
6864360	6868101	That was actually what I was going to say because... And I preempted it.
6868501	6868961	Because Ms.
6869001	6871162	Pac-Man... Well, actually, not Ms.
6871182	6872082	Pac-Man so much as Pac-Man.
6872102	6875743	In the sense of Tomb Raider 2, you could blow her up and throw her off the balcony and make her break her neck.
6875763	6876603	Yeah, yeah.
6877185	6877886	Here's another thing.
6878126	6884630	In this Pac-Man, you can't swan dive off a 30-story cliff and kill yourself, but you can do that in Tomb Raider, and that's what makes Tomb Raider fun.
6887352	6888493	You can see her with her broken neck.
6888713	6889013	Alright.
6890534	6891034	Moving on.
6891935	6892495	16, Halo.
6892515	6895577	I haven't played it, so I guess I'm not a true gamer.
6895597	6902162	15, and this... Halo is freaking gorgeous, and actually, I can probably say that, yeah, it should be up there.
6903082	6905244	You've played a few FPSs, I believe.
6906601	6907681	First Person Shooters, right?
6910222	6911023	Hold on.
6912943	6913764	Jamie, I need to get something.
6914624	6917505	I think you've played quite a few First Person Shooters before, right?
6918185	6920266	So you know the difference.
6920286	6924288	I've never played Halo, so what's so great about Halo that makes it different than other First Person Shooters?
6925148	6931470	It's just really interactive, very responsive, and you've got so many different levels you can play on, and you can play it in different ways.
6931911	6935432	Plus, when you play multiplayer, you can play cooperatively with another person.
6935993	6938835	instead of having, excuse me, Deathmatch.
6938875	6940417	I'm, like, burping up.
6941738	6942118	All right.
6942138	6946041	Anyway, but on top of that, it's really pretty.
6946201	6946942	I mean, really pretty.
6947002	6950464	And it really shows what the Xbox can do, honestly.
6950965	6956629	And for me, even though Xbox isn't my favorite system, I'd have to say that, yeah, that has to be up there.
6956649	6958871	And by the way, if Steel Battalion is not on the list, I'm going to scream.
6959532	6960732	It's not.
6962414	6963355	Okay, moving on to number 15.
6964195	6965096	And this is a game...
6965805	6969326	I think should be in the top three, but it's not, but whatever.
6969906	6970727	15, Civilization 2.
6972027	6973848	What, um, yeah.
6973968	6976889	The greatest strategy game on the computer of all time.
6977509	6977849	Period.
6979750	6981931	No, Matt's saying Get a Rope.
6982291	6989994	Um, Civilization 2 may not be my type of game, but I've seen, I like Civilization 1.
6991054	6994095	I guess I wasn't as much into strategy games as I am, like adventure stuff.
6994571	6997873	But I could see how it's so good, because I did like Civilization 1 for a while.
6998353	6999774	Then it started to grate on me or whatever.
6999794	7005738	But, I don't know, Sid Meier, I mean, he's just, I guess he's a genius when it comes to making strategy games, simulation games and stuff, so.
7006598	7012082	I think also, Civilization can kind of be seen, this is the way I look at it, it's strategy games for dummies.
7012662	7014503	It's a very accessible kind of game.
7014803	7017185	Like, you don't really have to be into strategy games to play them.
7017205	7018125	Well, that's what I'm saying.
7018265	7022508	Sid Meier kind of makes his games kind of user-friendly, even though they have a lot of strategy involved.
7023427	7026268	You can get into it even if you're kind of... I mean, like the Sims.
7026688	7031650	It can get pretty complicated, but... It's pretty actually... It shows you how to play pretty easily.
7032030	7032670	Alright, moving on.
7033650	7034330	Fourteen.
7035111	7036411	Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.
7037411	7038712	Yep, I'd have to say so.
7039412	7041913	Changed the face of skateboard games forever.
7042153	7045534	I mean, skateboard games... What other... Skate or die.
7045954	7048795	Skate or die should be above... Hold on, Tony Hawk's.
7049095	7049375	Hold on.
7050175	7051256	In my opinion, or 720. 720.
7053180	7065628	Menace Beach, 720, 720, hey that's cool, um, no, TNC Surf Designs, um, no, but seriously, to me there basically are only two skateboard games, Tony Hawk Bros.
7065648	7070151	Skater and Skater Die, so, that goes to show you how good Tony Hawk is.
7071231	7074173	Come on, 720, what other game do you get chased by bees?
7076034	7077655	Again, didn't that happen in Paperboy?
7077796	7078076	Shut up.
7080825	7081825	No, Paperboy's not on the list.
7081845	7083566	God, Paperboy's not on the list, or Crystal Castles?
7083806	7083926	Nope.
7083966	7084786	Marble Madness?
7084846	7085006	Nope.
7086206	7087266	Those retards.
7087506	7088127	Okay, here we go.
7089327	7090327	13, Gran Turismo.
7092347	7095748	Again, changed totally the course of racing games.
7096728	7108251	And all the, not just realistic driving engine, but like, such a design, you know, aspect, like fine-tuning your cars and everything, it being like the main reason to even play the game.
7108271	7109911	They just changed the direction.
7111195	7116037	Alright, now, number 12, and when I say this game, I need to make a footnote here.
7116557	7130043	Basically what they did, I noticed on the G4 Entertainment Weekly list, is they kind of took series, and then kind of looped them all together into one position on the list, and then kind of, this list that I'm looking at kind of highlights one game.
7130523	7131283	So you see what I'm saying?
7131323	7134784	Even though I'm saying one game in the series, it means the whole series, basically.
7134804	7135365	You see what I'm saying?
7135885	7136305	Make sense?
7136385	7139006	Okay, with that being said, number 12 is Final Fantasy 7.
7139046	7139186	Okay.
7141953	7143914	But that was to mean the whole Final Fantasy series.
7143934	7146896	If they meant the whole series, if they truly meant that, that's forgivable.
7147256	7153820	But I think they said Final Fantasy VII probably because more people know about Final Fantasy VII than any other Final Fantasy, because it really changed.
7154821	7160025	One thing about Final Fantasy VII is that it brought it into, I guess, the modern age of games.
7161666	7166649	Right, and it was mostly... Although I have to say, though, that
7167839	7174501	It was... Now that I've gone back to play it again, I'm still hoping that they... The rumor proves out true and that they do an updated version.
7175001	7176442	Because it would really benefit from it.
7180623	7182504	Sorry, we can't hear Ice Queen because he has no mic.
7183124	7183964	Matt is saying what?
7184205	7184625	Oh, crap.
7184645	7190207	The mic's stuck in the... Okay.
7190247	7190947	What were you saying, Matt?
7192607	7196989	What I was saying for anybody that cares was that Final Fantasy VII was...
7198090	7203413	Really, really good just because of the fact that it revolutionized the eye candy for Final Fantasy.
7204013	7204934	It was the first eye candy.
7204954	7208236	It doesn't look very good now, but for its time it looked really, really good.
7209136	7211658	And it had really good backgrounds, yeah.
7212398	7226646	The thing, the people that are like, kind of like gaming purists would, or Final Fantasy 6 purists or whatever would say is that that's a bad thing that it revolutionized the eye candy thing because Squaresoft for a while started going only for the cinematics and the eye candy for a while.
7227148	7229930	and they just forgot about gameplay when it comes to, like, Final Fantasy VIII.
7231191	7232011	That's my opinion.
7232031	7232972	VIII wasn't actually that bad.
7233592	7233913	Exactly.
7234713	7235574	Jamie says X was good.
7235594	7239436	I think they kind of went back to mixing the gameplay with the cinematics.
7240297	7245401	But wait, what were we... There was something I was going to say.
7245561	7248423	Do you want me to... Can I elaborate on the Final Fantasy VII remake thing?
7248823	7249323	Keep going, yeah.
7249463	7249744	Okay.
7250524	7254547	Jamie was saying she really hopes the rumor about Final Fantasy VII remake on PS2 is true.
7255208	7267654	they did an interview with us well actually Squaresoft posted something to the users about we've started to make sequels to Final Fantasy with Final Fantasy X-2 coming out which other games would you like there to be sequels to?
7268215	7284823	overwhelmingly people said Final Fantasy 7 Squaresoft rebuttaled by saying we don't have the time or effort to remake the engine for Final Fantasy 7 of course everybody said use X2's engine we use whatever now so if that's true that they don't have the time money or effort to make it
7285247	7286868	They're not going to be able to remake Final Fantasy 7.
7287748	7292569	But there was a rumor, and it was confirmed that eventually they were going to remake Final Fantasy 7.
7292609	7293170	So, I don't know.
7293310	7295650	Squirtle's got their head up their asses now, so who knows.
7296631	7296931	Alright.
7298551	7301572	Moving on to the list, and I'll just say it.
7301612	7303593	Number 11 is GoldenEye 007.
7304853	7308874	That game was actually pretty good, but that game actually did make me throw up.
7309575	7309595	I...
7312054	7316855	I don't care if it's the best Nintendo 64 game ever made, it's undeserving of being in the top 20, in my opinion.
7319656	7332078	The way it got up there is because if it wasn't for that game, Halo wouldn't be around, because it did make first-person shooters on the console a popular thing, especially multiplayer first-person shooters on the console.
7334279	7339860	Before, all there was, you had to have a computer and a LAN, you know, to play...
7340325	7341165	multiplayer shooters.
7341446	7345328	And then all of a sudden here comes Nintendo 64 with their only good game besides Zelda.
7345448	7347208	What about Faceball 2000?
7347869	7348589	Faceball?
7350050	7351070	That was all over then.
7351090	7352391	Yeah, but it was a multiplayer game.
7352411	7353211	Have a nice day.
7354152	7356573	Sadly enough, I played through the whole game of that.
7357954	7358874	I weep for you.
7360615	7362716	Speaking though, you know what I wish they had done?
7363457	7365998	I wish that they had actually done the Satellaview games in the States.
7367298	7368279	The Satellaview games.
7370088	7373691	If you look on the bottom of your ship for Nintendo, there's this thing that will pull out.
7374151	7375572	That's where a modem was supposed to go.
7376393	7378434	Why isn't North and South on that list?
7380976	7382497	Yes, they should have done the modem thing.
7382517	7386039	Because they had the best version of Zelda on that.
7386720	7387721	Alright, moving on.
7387741	7392224	I'm going to try to kind of jam through this list because we have some other segments left we've got to do.
7393605	7395026	Number 10 was Street Fighter 2.
7395606	7396867	Yes, next.
7397768	7398128	Brad, hey.
7398732	7399332	Street Fighter 2, number 10.
7399372	7403854	Street Fighter 2 started my first fangirl crush, other than Jed Nelson.
7404014	7405795	Street Fighter 2 is what got me into... It was Ryu.
7406195	7406575	Hello.
7406695	7408276	Street Fighter 2 is what got me into arcades.
7408776	7409056	Okay.
7410057	7411077	Street Fighter 2 is a great game.
7411277	7411577	I love it.
7411617	7412157	I always will.
7412498	7417680	But it kind of is, to me, kind of like the Ms.
7417700	7418480	Pac-Man thing I said.
7419500	7421261	It started a new type of game.
7422522	7424523	A lot of people say that Street Fighter 2 is the...
7427259	7427679	The Pong?
7427699	7428079	The Pong?
7445782	7450864	but it is deserving of being on that list so it's one of those things where it's kind of more of a nod to the genre like Ms.
7450884	7455947	Pac-Man was like there would be no Maze Game without but in that case they should have put Pac-Man not Ms.
7455987	7465171	Pac-Man but whatever yeah so I agree that it should be near the top of the list but oh Loki thinks Loki thinks they put Ms.
7465211	7474635	Pac-Man on the list because it got girls to play games well that's what they said in the goddamn show whatever well the whole thing about Street Fighter Street Fighter 2 is that
7475228	7478530	It was so widely popular, but it really blew the doors open.
7478610	7484733	And the thing is, when I actually bought my own Super Nintendo, the first game I got was Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo.
7485873	7486594	That was my game.
7487895	7489856	And I was such a Ryu fan girl, and I still am.
7491716	7493717	I used E-Honda because he was fat like me.
7494778	7495138	Okay.
7495238	7495939	Number nine.
7496799	7498060	StarCraft and WarCraft.
7498080	7498320	Whatever.
7498340	7498520	Whatever.
7502829	7508273	If I have to play another RTS game, I will put a gun to my head and pull the trigger.
7509133	7511195	I don't like real-time strategy games.
7511915	7516718	And they did not... How could you say Starcraft and Warcraft are different games?
7516738	7518620	I think they should be in the top 20, but not above Civilization.
7519080	7519620	Oh, hell no.
7519760	7521281	Dude, fucking Red Alert.
7521361	7522302	That game rocks.
7522962	7523803	I love Command & Conquer.
7523823	7524223	No, no, no.
7524283	7527866	Command & Conquer Ghost will be a lot better, but that's a first-person shooter.
7528106	7528526	Moving on.
7530322	7532763	The only red alert that's cool is the Transformer.
7535425	7536626	Number eight.
7537426	7538247	Another series.
7538967	7540128	Super Mario 64.
7541349	7542569	That was actually very fun.
7542609	7547512	Dan and I, when I first moved in with Dan, we would just spend hours all night playing Mario 64.
7548072	7550154	Like trying to do the special jump to get to the roof.
7552855	7555637	I agree definitely with putting Mario in the top ten.
7555677	7557298	I actually think it ought to be higher.
7557765	7559286	But I don't agree with the game they highlighted.
7559326	7560947	And it started at Mario Sunshine.
7560987	7562228	We wouldn't have Mario Sunshine without it.
7562388	7564430	I agree, but I think Mario Bros.
7564670	7567311	3 is the one they should have kind of picked to lead the pack.
7567351	7568632	I think that was the best Mario game they made.
7570033	7571855	See, I feel like Mario World better than Mario 3.
7574997	7575657	Hold on, hold on.
7576938	7577378	Hold on.
7578319	7582041	Yes, Matt's saying Super Mario 64 and Sunshine are different.
7582662	7583743	Okay, here's why Jamie...
7586474	7589276	made the comparison.
7589536	7600344	Because Super Mario, as in Super Mario on Nintendo, is an original platform side-scorer game, whereas Mario 64 is a 3D platformer, and it plays differently.
7600604	7605107	The idea is similar, but it plays completely differently, because it's in a 3D realm.
7605367	7609250	And because of Mario 64, we have games like Monkey... What's it called?
7609290	7610070	That PlayStation game?
7610110	7610731	Super Monkey Ball.
7610751	7611251	Ape Escape.
7611631	7611711	Oh.
7612132	7612652	Ape Escape.
7612712	7613833	Another 3D platformer game.
7613853	7615594	It's like Jak and Daxter, I think, and...
7615970	7617671	Like these games that are pretty popular, I hear.
7617931	7618311	Spyro.
7619251	7621913	Spyro, I didn't really like Spyro, but it is popular.
7622073	7624774	Everyone always forgets about what Mario is missing.
7625674	7628695	Because that game sucks ass!
7629276	7629996	Do you know what that is?
7630456	7634818	It's Nintendo's version of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego, and it's a bad interpretation of it.
7635158	7637059	Alright, we gotta move on with this list.
7638101	7642063	I hate to say it, but if we don't get through this list, we're not going to be able to get the FUs of the week.
7642443	7643564	Oh my god, no way out.
7644184	7645905	Okay, I know, we haven't even done the FUs of the week yet.
7646005	7647526	So, number seven.
7648247	7649968	This is, I want to see Brad's reaction to this.
7649988	7651348	Number seven, The Sims.
7654530	7655210	Number seven?
7656491	7657912	And I actually agree with this.
7658372	7660693	I agree with it because it's the top selling computer game of all time.
7660713	7661574	Period.
7661594	7661874	Period.
7662661	7665324	and it's accessible to everybody.
7666185	7669568	It's a video game that has no limits, literally.
7669688	7675854	I mean, boys, girls, men, women, children, everybody can play this game and it's very accessible and everybody has fun with it.
7676234	7678836	The only problem with The Sims is that it has no goal.
7678957	7679677	There's no objective.
7679717	7680298	But in a way...
7680805	7682045	That's kind of the appeal of it.
7682286	7684366	It kind of made way for games like Animal Crossing.
7684466	7686327	Isn't that all Sid Meier's games?
7686367	7687387	They have no goal.
7688147	7689648	Not even Civilization has a goal.
7689728	7691569	Sid Meier did not do The Sims, if I'm not mistaken.
7691669	7692669	Are you serious?
7692969	7694290	Let me elaborate on that.
7694570	7698371	They actually, the PC versions have no goal.
7699091	7702012	Overall, your goal, obviously, is to be successful and whatever.
7702032	7707554	But in the console versions, they do have goal-oriented things in there.
7707901	7712544	because obviously you're limited to what you can hold on the console and stuff.
7713104	7713725	Did you say my name?
7714005	7714305	All right.
7715266	7715706	Here we go.
7716606	7718868	Number six, Half-Life.
7722010	7722510	Any comments?
7722850	7723851	Okay, I played Half-Life.
7725952	7727673	Hold on, Matt's saying Half-Life isn't that good.
7729594	7733257	Half-Life kind of changed first-person shooters.
7733957	7735318	After Half-Life,
7735854	7740638	These games started coming out kind of like, I think System Shock 2 and stuff came out after Half-Life.
7740658	7741198	I can't remember.
7741358	7742379	Somebody could probably call me on that.
7742759	7745201	And they started becoming more story-oriented.
7745961	7751786	You know, you had to think more instead of just straight on look and shoot, kill things.
7751806	7755008	You had to kind of more think in a problem-solving way.
7756729	7758711	You know, I don't know if I would put it that high on the list.
7758771	7760252	I think it's way too high on the list.
7760412	7763174	Especially considering the number of other FPSs they have on the list.
7763732	7766193	Because there's another one still on the list that we haven't gotten to yet.
7766213	7766594	Oh, great.
7767674	7768455	Number five.
7768515	7769695	This is an interesting choice.
7769815	7772136	I suppose you have to have a sports game somewhere in the top ten.
7772337	7774598	Matt in 2003.
7775138	7775618	I'm sorry.
7777219	7778840	Super high impact football is better.
7780041	7781761	We're spending way much time on this game.
7781801	7782342	Go to the next one.
7782722	7783863	None of us play sports games.
7783903	7784843	Give me a fucking break.
7785784	7786524	Tecmo Bowl.
7786764	7787264	Enough said.
7787444	7787785	No, no.
7788005	7789706	Tecmo Bowl and super high impact.
7791275	7794678	NBA Jam, I think it's the only one I even put 10 seconds on, and that was it.
7798421	7799542	Blitz was actually kind of funny.
7800623	7801464	Blitz was kind of funny.
7803566	7805788	Super Tennis on Super Nintendo, I did play that.
7807469	7808350	Alright, moving on.
7809091	7809491	Here we go.
7810432	7811433	Getting down to the wire.
7811453	7812814	Number 4, Grand Theft Auto 3.
7813875	7815016	Yeah, that has to be on there.
7815056	7817098	It was pretty unique.
7819089	7821050	It's again the series highlighted by one game.
7821411	7823132	And Vice City is just 3's engine, isn't it?
7824212	7826454	Vice City is a little bit different, the engine.
7826714	7835579	They upgraded the graphics a bit, and they changed... I don't know, I guess it is the same engine, maybe they just... I don't know.
7836340	7837821	Unlimited some things in the graphics.
7838321	7839402	Alright.
7839502	7841243	Number 3, Tetris.
7844805	7846426	I almost think it ought to be number 1.
7847911	7848351	I'll say it.
7848471	7849352	I'll say it.
7849372	7850293	I'm going to leave now.
7850333	7850793	Goodbye.
7852014	7852834	That's so weird.
7854735	7856176	Without that, we wouldn't have Tetranet.
7858358	7859558	I ran something to contribute.
7859638	7859859	Yes.
7861520	7870105	I kind of think that's why Mrs. Pac-Man was so high on the list, because it has kind of the same appeal as Tetris, where you could play it over and over and over, and it's different every time.
7870563	7873545	You don't have to worry about graphics or anything like that.
7873585	7876186	It's something you can take with you to work and play.
7876446	7878948	You don't have to immerse yourself into a story or anything.
7878988	7879988	It's just pick up and go.
7880568	7881649	It's the same as Tetris.
7882249	7887472	Also, if I'm not mistaken, out of the 100 games on this list, this is one of only two puzzle games on the whole list.
7887972	7888493	Puzzle Fighter 2.
7889033	7892515	But how many puzzle games did Tetris influence?
7892575	7894316	Columns.
7895296	7896637	What was the one I'm thinking of?
7897758	7899499	Besides Puzzle Fighter, there was...
7901078	7906120	But I'm not really disappointed with what they did put as number one, so number three is fair.
7906781	7907081	Magical drop.
7907101	7907421	Magical drop.
7908001	7908301	Alright.
7909222	7909662	Moving on.
7910102	7910723	Number two.
7911903	7914664	I promised there'd be another FPS on here before we got to the end.
7914705	7915005	Doom.
7915745	7916025	Yes.
7917006	7923129	Because I would come home from school, I would go back to Marcy's house, and we would play Doom all night.
7924069	7925830	And go to the Wolfenstein level.
7925930	7929752	I think because this game is here, Half-Life should not be on this list at all.
7930012	7930252	Yeah.
7931800	7934921	Well, Half-Life is... And I question Halo's presence.
7934941	7937962	Half-Life puts more of a story into it.
7938102	7940743	Yeah, Matt's saying Half-Life puts more of a story into it, and I think that's why they put it there.
7941024	7942984	But that does make you question Halo being there.
7943244	7945765	Halo's the most successful Xbox game.
7946305	7949066	Halo is the most successful Xbox game, is what Matt says.
7949427	7950107	Matt Loki, Matt.
7951047	7951307	Hold on.
7951827	7952288	Here's the thing.
7953488	7954848	I see what they're doing here on this list.
7954868	7956029	They're going by genre.
7956069	7958950	It's like they're cycling through genre games and which ones are the best in the genre.
7960123	7962504	We might as well have just a top 20 games in each genre.
7962524	7965326	That would have been more of a better idea, but whatever.
7966606	7970708	Number one, and obviously somebody can guess this because it hasn't been named yet.
7971088	7971549	Let Irene.
7974270	7976871	And it is... Drumroll please.
7977211	7978292	A Boy and His Bob!
7980113	7983174	That's my choice, but it's The Legend of Zelda.
7983374	7985935	Can you guess which game in the series they chose to highlight?
7985955	7986576	The original.
7986916	7987096	Nope.
7988140	7988800	Link to the Past.
7988840	7989321	Really?
7989521	7990001	Link to the Past.
7990021	7991082	Oh, I thought you told me the original.
7991522	7992102	Nope.
7992142	7994044	I just heard you tell me the original.
7994804	7995725	I totally guessed it.
7996045	8000627	And I'm okay with Tetris not being number one because Zelda's, you know, God.
8000667	8002569	Link to the Past was the best of the series.
8002609	8003249	And I agree.
8003289	8004750	Link to the Past was the best of the series.
8004830	8005170	Period.
8005790	8007852	I think it's better than Ocarina of Time even.
8008332	8013395	And I think... Give Ice Queen a mic, please.
8016061	8024029	I'd have to say that Ocarina of Time was about equal to A Link to the Past, but this new freaking Zelda that's out, compared to these other two, sucks ass.
8024370	8026752	It's good in its own way, but not as a Zelda.
8027773	8028414	Yes, I did.
8029054	8034140	It's good in its own way, it's got a good story, but you're a freaking treasure hunter the whole freaking game.
8035141	8036562	You're a goddamn treasure hunter.
8036822	8038144	I'm sorry, but that is not Zelda.
8039151	8041073	I think I probably had the most fun out of all the Zeldas.
8041093	8041833	Probably playing the...
8067771	8068972	Oracle Games on Game Boy.
8069352	8080298	No, no, I'm sad about the whole, you know, the way they did this, Legends, all the, imagine, you know, Legends all linked to the past storyline with the graphics of Wind Waker.
8080778	8084360	That's what I was imagining that I wanted, you know, out of this game.
8085781	8089944	Well, there's still time for them to change, you know, make a new one that's like that.
8090224	8094266	They were going in kind of a different direction as the way the gameplay flows and everything in this one.
8094286	8097468	They wanted to go for more of a, like an anime style drama type
8098719	8107766	And I really, really like this one, and it probably is my favorite of the... It is my favorite of, like, the 3D Zeldas, but... Different type of game, in my opinion.
8109627	8115732	The biggest problem, and this isn't gonna be a spoiler, it might be a little bit, but the biggest problem is the fact that there are so few dungeons.
8116953	8119034	That's the thing that killed this Zelda for me.
8119755	8121356	There's... There's no dungeons!
8122357	8127561	Yeah, that's great, but I spent, like, three hours in one of the dungeons once, so I don't care if there's four, five, six dungeons.
8127621	8127841	I mean...
8128168	8130009	That was a long time to spend in one dungeon.
8131189	8131650	You know what, though?
8131690	8135591	In Ocarina of Time, if you don't know what you're doing, you could easily spend three or four hours in a dungeon.
8135651	8147897	And you had all of those that, well, yeah, the water one especially, but because of that freaking tricky little... I can see that a little bit, because I get really aggravated by those fucking caves in PSO.
8148437	8151418	My God, you spend like five hours in those freaking caves.
8151438	8153299	It's like, chains of scenery, please.
8153399	8154339	Oh, Phantasy Star Online?
8154439	8155060	Yeah.
8155260	8155540	I don't know.
8156007	8157007	Bionic Commando Blaster Master
8178482	8182803	No mention of the Mega Man series at all in the top 100.
8183783	8184764	That's my only beef.
8185024	8187004	No Mega Mans anywhere in the top 100.
8187064	8187805	What is up with that?
8188385	8189585	Actraiser was not on the list.
8190705	8193026	Chrono Trigger being so low was another one of my bitches.
8193206	8194006	Yeah, that's sad.
8195147	8196047	Was Boy This Bomb on there?
8196307	8196487	No.
8196687	8196947	What?
8197627	8198347	Killed it now.
8200768	8201888	And we could Ragnarok online.
8201908	8202709	Why was that not on there?
8202729	8203469	Dance Dance Revolution was 40.
8203509	8203749	Really?
8205549	8205749	Wow.
8206050	8207690	Dance Dance Revolution was higher than Chrono Trigger.
8208976	8211397	That's a travesty.
8211457	8212578	I'm never going to watch G4.
8213699	8214339	I'm going to bomb them.
8214519	8216640	Phantasy Star was on the list, actually.
8216720	8218141	Somebody's bitching about Phantasy Star.
8218481	8221163	Phantasy Star was... I might have skipped over it.
8221203	8221923	It was in the beginning.
8221963	8222403	Sorry, kids.
8222443	8222583	It was 76.
8222723	8226706	What the hell kind of crack addict loser printed up that list?
8226966	8229707	They put Chrono Trigger underneath the money?
8229867	8232249	G4 TV and Entertainment Weekly.
8232289	8233489	You can address those card readers.
8233669	8235810	You people from those companies, you're losers.
8235830	8238572	You don't know what the hell you're talking about, and you should try playing video games.
8239252	8240613	Hold on, Entertainment Weekly?
8241033	8244416	They don't even know what a video game is, so why are they doing a list like this?
8244436	8245676	It's why they partnered with G4.
8245877	8248959	But G4 doesn't even know what a video game is, apparently, you know?
8250060	8251861	The whole entire Puyo Puyo series.
8252801	8255824	I mean, I understand putting Tetris on there, but Puyo Puyo played so differently.
8256624	8265090	I mean, I played, you know, Kirby's Avalanche, and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, and where was Sonic Adventure? !
8265953	8268177	and even Sonic was lower than it should have been.
8269299	8270862	Very, very good mention.
8270942	8273126	Multiple people in the chat room are saying this, Earthbound.
8276973	8277834	It should have been a mention.
8278014	8279614	I can see why it would not be in the top 50.
8280074	8281715	Because nobody knows about it.
8282295	8283415	I disagree.
8283835	8285956	It's one of the hugest cult video games out there.
8286376	8287236	But it's a cult video game.
8287256	8287776	Twisted Metal 2.
8287836	8291598	They were obviously going for games that people know about.
8291778	8293658	And I never even heard about EarthBound until I met you.
8294378	8298659	I think the fact that it's one of the biggest cult games of all time ought to put it on there.
8298679	8300900	What about Final Fantasy Mystic Quest?
8301220	8304141	And people will know EarthBound soon because it's coming out on Game Boy Advance.
8306030	8306311	All right.
8306391	8306651	Yep.
8309251	8310652	Oh, another excellent mention.
8310752	8312452	Illusion of Gaia and that whole series.
8312592	8312833	Nowhere.
8312853	8313493	Soul Blazer.
8313873	8316094	Soul Blazer was not mentioned.
8316234	8316794	You know what?
8316854	8318034	Smash Brothers wasn't on there.
8318174	8318734	Nope, wasn't.
8319315	8320255	Guardian Legend.
8321055	8321675	Guardian Legend.
8321715	8323216	Yeah, my game is not on the list.
8323836	8324556	Damn those people.
8324916	8327217	Let's not get dank and run over G4.
8327237	8332098	We're going to give you guys some time to foam and get pissy over the top 100 list.
8332118	8332759	Hold on.
8332979	8333279	Hold on.
8333299	8333359	Yes.
8333579	8333779	Yes.
8335555	8337737	Do you want to hear my opinion about what game should have been number one?
8337897	8338057	What?
8338077	8339358	No, you don't, but I'm going to say anyway.
8339498	8339698	What?
8339718	8340639	Civilian Knight, of course.
8342240	8342600	Alright.
8342660	8344682	The Japanese version with the better voice acting.
8344922	8345922	The Saturn version.
8346603	8349385	We're running a little low on time, so I'm going to kick us over to break.
8349905	8350185	Okay.
8350225	8355169	So, we've done 7th style music, 8th style music, and 9th style music, so let's do some 6th style music.
8355849	8357110	Did we ever announce a cage match winner?
8357370	8357951	No, we didn't.
8358111	8359292	You want to announce a cage match winner?
8359872	8360693	Fucking Matt.
8361092	8362793	Yeah, it's Mona Lisa Overdrive again.
8362853	8363373	Hooray!
8363613	8365754	Yeah, but you can't win again.
8367195	8369296	First time... Shut up!
8370397	8372358	First time a song has been in for four weeks.
8372378	8375179	And by the way, another landslide vote for that one.
8375259	8377580	So, uh, good job for Mona Lisa Overdrive.
8377640	8381222	Kylie... Alright.
8381702	8383303	So, Mona Lisa Overdrive wins KTMG again.
8383583	8385184	Okay, so we're going to do some stick style songs.
8385624	8389046	And when we come back... Jamie, is there a stick style song you want to hear?
8389066	8389106	Um...
8392521	8393441	Similar to my mind, right?
8394161	8394422	Sure.
8394822	8395342	It's depressing.
8395522	8395962	It's goth.
8396483	8399004	And we're just going to do two six-style songs.
8399024	8403226	We need to come back and do the FUs of the week because we haven't done those yet.
8403386	8404127	Surprise, surprise.
8404167	8407468	So hurry up and send those to me over private message in the chat room.
8407508	8408189	My name is Sky.
8408229	8409469	We've got to keep it short this week.
8409509	8411750	Please keep your FUs of the week short, chat room.
8412911	8414812	All right, we'll be back in a little bit.
8433052	8434074	Thanks for watching!
8465054	8465875	Thanks for watching!
8539995	8543180	Thanks for watching!
8579603	8581906	DarkSakura.com
8605929	8606590	Thanks for watching!
8659618	8660879	Orange Lounge Radio.
8661199	8663360	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
8664200	8664420	Hi, kids.
8664460	8665901	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
8673760	8678621	and gosh, it's awfully late in the show to start this, but you know, that list was just so much fun.
8680361	8681042	What can we say?
8682422	8683542	It's time for the FUs of the Week.
8683582	8685682	Jamie, what are the FUs of the Week all about?
8686263	8687943	We get pissy and tell stuff off.
8688163	8689443	All right, so here we go.
8689943	8691364	It's time to start the FUs of the Week.
8698225	8698705	Ooh.
8699885	8702266	Every time I listen to this, I still get, like, happy.
8702366	8702686	Cheers.
8705494	8709476	Um, the fact is that it goes toward idiot drivers who nearly run over me.
8709496	8714659	It goes toward the entire parking lot at Arden Fair Mall, because I nearly got hit a bunch of times.
8714699	8719581	And then, you know, it also goes toward me, you know, just being nervous in general.
8720301	8723083	And then it goes toward being exhausted and not being able to sleep.
8724223	8732047	And then it goes toward the person on Ragnarok Online who kept casting the ice spell and blocking all the paths and lagging me.
8732941	8735462	So, other than that, I'm not really all that angsty.
8735662	8737602	I'm very happy because I'm going to have a new live journal.
8738663	8739803	A pretty new live journal layout.
8739843	8741003	It is very pretty, I've seen it.
8741403	8742624	And it's very Transformery.
8743484	8744864	And I know another one.
8746105	8750246	Another fuck you goes toward all of those dubbed Headmasters episodes.
8750646	8762129	When I'm trying to find Japanese episodes, or, you know, raw ones, or ones that are subtitled, and instead I'm finding either the crappy three episodes they did in the States, which I already own, or...
8763030	8765212	Like, those bad dubs that they did.
8765912	8767393	Horrible dubs of Headmasters.
8769314	8770315	It's Transformers.
8771636	8774938	So, that pisses me off.
8776439	8779962	And another one goes toward me not being able to find another Hot Rod so I can have it at work.
8780943	8781423	And that's it.
8784945	8785266	Alright.
8786266	8787247	Loki.
8788848	8791130	Okay, um... F you to, uh...
8792902	8799248	Oh, I guess I should have done something other than just pat him in, you know, bubble wrap and write fragile, mm-hmm.
8818581	8823265	So I can't get my money back from her, but I'm going to give her one hell of a negative feedback on eBay.
8824546	8830771	But yeah, that wasted $15, plus the fact that I was overdrawn twice, so my bank charged me $60 for those records.
8831371	8834754	So that was a loss of $75 total for $15 for the records.
8837636	8840418	Yeah, at least my Eddie Murphy record works.
8840478	8841399	I had to bend it back.
8842840	8845182	Yeah, so that's the one I wanted anyways.
8845789	8858078	And then finally, in world news, FB to the dumb, uh, I don't know what nationality you are, but Middle Eastern bitch that's bitching in Florida about the fact that you have to remove your veil to take a driver's license photo.
8858318	8860120	Listen, bitch, you look like a fucking ninja.
8860160	8863422	You need to, like, take the damn veil off or just quit driving.
8863522	8867485	I better, yeah, why don't you just deport your ass over to, you know, the Middle East where you belong.
8867966	8871168	So, uh, yeah, sorry, I don't, I wanted to sound like some kind of, like,
8871966	8874567	I just have three words, four words Separation of church and state
8901658	8901958	I'm done.
8902359	8902939	That's all I had.
8903500	8910905	I don't know what you meant by that, but okay.
8910985	8915909	My FU of the week goes to my SARS, my never-ending case of SARS, and my brain tumor.
8917491	8918071	Fuck you, Irene.
8918091	8919412	My other FU goes to Irene.
8919932	8926137	And my next FU goes to the fact that I had, what, something like five, six drinks, and I was drunk for maybe like two minutes.
8927218	8927779	At the most.
8929040	8929380	Sucked.
8932052	8938495	It may have seemed like two minutes to you, but I remember you and like Matt and Irene freaking jumping around being all silly.
8938555	8939956	It was probably more like an hour.
8940456	8941897	Yeah, Irene like tripped.
8942297	8947899	She says she tripped, but it looks to me like she just did a Superman fly dive thing towards the emergency exit.
8947939	8948880	It was really interesting.
8950100	8953222	Alright, let's move on to other folks in the room's FUs of the week.
8955663	8956723	Uh, Brad?
8958344	8960665	FU goes to this segment because I really don't like it.
8962713	8963073	Irene.
8964736	8965317	FUs of the week.
8967662	8972010	My FUs to weird toe guys that are like frickin' scary.
8972642	8979869	that come to help you at like 3 o'clock in the morning and just say, yeah, doesn't anybody ever sleep in this town?
8980270	8980870	Fuck you, dude.
8982031	8984113	That's part of my view I totally forgot about.
8984394	8995104	I was driving home from, after dropping Rob and Matt off at their place, at Rob's place, I was driving around and my tire went flat and my CV half shaft in the front right of my car blew out.
8995144	8996626	So that's a couple hundred dollars of a...
8997901	9024203	Fuck you do automobiles, shitty ones made in America or Japan or Korea or German or whatever, I don't care Yugoslavia, it doesn't matter, all cars suck in some way or another Play my music There Okay, I can't hear it, but anyway My allergies, fuck them Because now my chest hurts and I feel like I have SARS
9025259	9026981	And I actually feel sick, is the thing.
9027021	9027741	I feel sick.
9028822	9032986	And, like, fuck not having access to my PTO until another two months.
9034107	9038291	Because I would so just stay home and, like, cough up all my lungs and then feel better.
9038311	9040393	I have insurance.
9040973	9041954	My insurance kicked in today.
9041974	9043256	Okay.
9043376	9043716	I can't.
9044877	9045598	Uh, is that it?
9045638	9045858	Yeah.
9046418	9046799	Yeah.
9046859	9046999	Okay.

9053396	9055436	First, fuck you, go see you for not getting my name right, bitch.
9055516	9056457	It's Ice Princess.
9056477	9057617	Thank you very much.
9057977	9059197	The Ice Princess.
9060497	9063158	And I'm only an instant slut when I have alcohol, so there.
9063358	9068259	And yeah, fuck you, my allergies too, and the fact that Claritin is like frickin' $12 for 10 pills.
9069219	9071900	It works really well, but it's $12 for 10 tablets.
9073020	9073940	It's overpriced.
9074480	9077121	It works well, it's overpriced, and it makes me really dehydrated.
9078760	9081121	Alright, let's move on to the chatroom FUs.

9238118	9238458	Shut up.
9238798	9246141	Angel would like to give an F you to obnoxious, egotistical, seniority-slinging co-workers who get paid for nothing else than to boss people around and make them feel like shit.
9247161	9248081	Yeah, me too.
9248641	9249782	There's not question mark.
9249802	9250322	That was a typo.
9250362	9250582	Oops.
9251434	9253475	Quit your job, it feels really, really, really good.
9253615	9253995	I promise.
9254015	9254755	I tell you, you're out of money.
9256075	9263618	Justin would like to say F you to myself because I got into Ragnarok just as the servers came back, but I DC'd and tried to reconnect and it didn't let me.
9264078	9265518	Oh well, I will have it by Wednesday.
9265698	9267439	I will be there soon, Jamie.
9268199	9270460	And Sky, play this song, The Window.
9270520	9271340	People need to be scared.
9271360	9271860	I have no time.
9272440	9274921	Also, F you to me puking nine times on Wednesday.
9275221	9275981	F you to my sickness.
9276342	9277162	You have SARS.
9277302	9277762	Ha ha.
9279763	9280843	That's it for the F yous.
9282048	9282748	Yay!
9283008	9283388	Hooray!
9283408	9284969	I've got something to talk about.
9285809	9286389	Yes, Loki.
9288450	9303095	Once again, and you only have three hours left, you will go instantly, right now, not waiting one second, and go vote for The Legend of Trance on Bomani style, and you will vote a ten, and you will like it.
9304336	9304756	That is all.
9306036	9308397	And that would be the remix contest, yet?
9308557	9311638	Yes, you want them to vote The Legend of Trance and Dark Black Forest, both tens.
9313294	9314094	That is correct.
9315215	9315935	Where are you?
9317756	9318777	Yeah, what are you ranked right now?
9319637	9320478	I think I'm like fifth.
9321778	9322339	Unacceptable.
9325220	9326361	I still get a CD.
9328942	9334585	Also, other things that you can do, you can vote our station of five in your Live365 player window, because we love the ratings.
9335105	9339568	And you can also pour out our listening hours by listening to us all day long.
9340828	9342289	La la, la la.
9344557	9347041	All right, so let's do the Orange Crush thingy.
9356843	9358324	Okay, I'm unfolding my paper.
9358404	9361126	Now it's time for Orange Crush.
9361386	9364307	It's time to ask questions during Orange Crush.
9364407	9364727	Yay!
9365188	9366588	I love the theme song.
9366648	9366929	It's cool.
9367189	9367449	Okay.
9368109	9368249	Wait.
9368810	9369590	Everyone's leaving.
9369690	9370410	Everyone's leaving.
9370451	9370591	What?
9370631	9372732	They're like, I don't want to do Orange Crush.
9372772	9373272	It sucks.
9373892	9376013	Wait, where's... Hello, we need contestants.
9376114	9377374	Yeah, he's back, he's back.
9377434	9377894	Okay, here he is.
9377914	9381396	Okay, so the theme of this one is foreplay.
9381777	9382257	Hee hee hee.
9382897	9383558	and these are questions.
9383598	9384378	Irene's favorite.
9384638	9386920	Yeah, these are questions about Osamu Kubota.
9387521	9387841	All right.
9387941	9389722	Yeah, and then Matt's like, oh, fuck, I'm screwed.
9390183	9393745	But, okay, so does anyone have a timer for 30 seconds?
9393825	9394125	I do.
9394306	9394706	I'll time it.
9394726	9395346	Okay, super.
9395727	9396047	Here we go.
9396067	9397168	Okay, so we'll, huh?
9397208	9398409	Yeah, turn it down.
9398649	9398869	Yeah.
9398929	9399750	Oh, here, I'll turn it down.
9399810	9400270	Yeah.
9400570	9401251	Okay, so.
9402632	9403112	No, you're fine.
9403152	9403492	We're fine.
9403833	9405354	I just turned off the in-studio sound completely.
9405374	9405674	Okay.
9406014	9407015	Okay.
9407035	9407816	Here, I'll give a mic to Matt.
9407836	9408176	Here we go.
9408276	9410978	Okay, in three, two, one.
9412179	9412419	You ready?
9412439	9413340	Yeah, go.
9413360	9413460	Okay.
9413860	9415581	What year was Osamu Kubota born?
9416402	9416942	I don't care.
9417742	9419763	Let's see.
9419784	9419763	1963.
9420164	9420344	Okay.
9420624	9421665	What's his blood type?
9424386	9425087	A positive.
9425707	9425927	Okay.
9426327	9429409	What tax song was Osamu Kubota consulted on?
9430150	9431090	Consulted on?
9431490	9433432	Yeah, that he helped with.
9433452	9433432	.59.
9433472	9434252	I don't know.
9434352	9435153	Okay.
9435233	9436333	What are his... Whatever.
9436353	9436974	I don't give a fuck.
9437294	9438875	What are his two main hobbies?
9439495	9440256	His two main hobbies...
9441448	9443669	Playing games and killing people.
9443729	9444089	I don't know.
9444489	9444729	Okay.
9446630	9452313	You got none of... Okay, yeah, that's right.
9452413	9452713	Okay.
9452833	9454734	Alright, so how many did Matt get?
9456114	9457595	Yeah, he got none of them right.
9457715	9458796	Oh, Matt got none of them right.
9458896	9459196	Okay.
9459936	9463578	So, then we're ready to bring in Jamie.
9463778	9465579	Yeah, but she's going potty right now.
9465599	9466359	Is Jamie ready?
9467499	9468160	I think that's a no.
9468420	9468660	Uh-oh.
9469792	9472033	Let's do some more Orange Crush It's time to crush the Orange Crush
9486414	9492235	We're in an intermission right now because we're waiting for contestant number two.
9492255	9495316	Let me ask, do people like Orange Crush?
9495436	9497316	Is this going to be a regular segment?
9497716	9499676	Are the people in the chatroom digging it?
9499916	9502917	Because I've got a lot of material.
9503477	9504657	I think they like it.
9504797	9505617	They like you, Irene.
9505637	9506158	They really like you.
9506698	9507678	Aw, thanks.
9507718	9508598	You love me.
9508738	9510258	You really love me.
9510778	9511759	Hand the mic over to Brad.
9511919	9513799	He has an idea and I'm scared, but
9517119	9529586	It looks like with the nature of these questions and stuff, and obviously the lack of knowledge that our contestants have on these questions, we might should be able to change the length of the time or whatever to 45 seconds.
9531187	9531747	But not now.
9531767	9532848	Not now.
9534049	9540112	That's production notes, but I'm allowed to give that out since we're sitting here waiting forever.
9540232	9543134	And you know, what else am I thinking in regards to Orange Crush?
9544083	9546044	I want to do Orange Jeopardy one week on the show.
9546304	9550587	If you thought that G4 thing took forever on the show, I want to do Orange Jeopardy.
9550607	9552628	Can I give a hint about another Orange Crush?
9553808	9555029	Here's another thing I don't like about it.
9555129	9560752	It's like you're giving specific categories about certain people and stuff that have no friggin' clue about what the hell's going on.
9560952	9561813	It needs to be multiple.
9562133	9563614	Hold on, hold on.
9563634	9564214	Multiple choice?
9565322	9567804	It needs to either be multiple choice or it needs to be something else.
9567824	9568504	That's a good idea.
9568544	9570246	Maybe we should try multiple choice sometime.
9570906	9572447	I don't know nor care.
9572907	9574088	Here's the thing, Matt.
9574248	9578311	We understand that people aren't going to know a lot of the answers to these questions.
9578331	9580812	That's kind of why we're doing it because it's kind of like a knowledge thing.
9580832	9583714	We're teaching people out there who might have... People don't want to learn.
9583734	9584715	They just want to watch.
9585035	9592039	Some people are fanatics about some of the artists and so they like to know and they like to hear these things like birthdates of the artists.
9592740	9593080	I think...
9593686	9594467	Okay, time to go.
9594487	9595147	Alright, here we go.
9596108	9599030	Are you going to fill Jamie in on what tonight's... Oh, hi.
9599050	9599650	Fill me what?
9600911	9601552	Fill Jamie up.
9603533	9609838	Okay, the theme of tonight, Jamie, is called Foreplay, and these are questions about Osamu Kubota.
9610418	9611339	Which I read his website.
9612039	9612439	You did.
9612960	9614521	And you should know.
9614561	9616082	I'll probably get them wrong because I don't remember.
9616582	9618464	Okay, so do you have the time set?
9619244	9619445	Okay.
9620005	9621646	Three, two, one, go.
9622106	9622767	What year was he born?
9626604	9628225	74.
9627365	9628225	What's his blood type?
9630007	9634209	A. What tax song was Osamu Kubota consulted on?
9634589	9634810	Era.
9635810	9636831	What's his two main hobbies?
9638832	9640513	French and music.
9641494	9642955	What is the name of his production house?
9643395	9645156	Kubota Productions.
9648682	9648982	No.
9649943	9651224	Both of you got none of them right.
9652185	9652965	Okay, yeah.
9653445	9655847	He was born in 74, 72.
9656447	9655847	1965.
9656928	9657188	Okay.
9657388	9657568	Yeah.
9657968	9658429	He was born in 1965.
9658529	9661831	I'll relay, I'll relay.
9662552	9663953	You ask the questions, I'll relay the answers.
9664373	9665253	What's his blood type?
9666654	9668556	I'm going to say O. No, it's AB.
9669716	9670577	I almost said AB.
9671177	9671358	Yeah.
9671498	9672078	You were close.
9672158	9672358	Okay.
9672378	9673239	But it's AB, yeah.
9674795	9677978	Okay, what tax song was Osomo Kubota consulted on?
9678038	9680260	I know this one, Steal My Words.
9680480	9682983	Yeah, he did the piano part for Steal My Words.
9683563	9684864	Okay, what are his two main hobbies?
9685685	9687547	Cooking and traveling, right?
9687827	9688348	That's correct.
9688908	9694273	What is the name of his... Men and women, Matt?
9694974	9695935	That's his two hobbies?
9697026	9697387	Maybe.
9697447	9700731	I mean, if you take a look at him, he's kind of a mixture of the two.
9700951	9701552	Yeah, okay.
9701972	9704135	And what is the name of his production house?
9704155	9705036	This is really interesting.
9705056	9706198	This is very interesting, guys.
9706498	9706798	Listen.
9708220	9708481	Rob?
9709081	9709322	Okay.
9710223	9711845	What is the name of his production house?
9712025	9712586	Good Cool.
9712766	9714588	Yeah, that's the name of his production house.
9714608	9715830	Now, think about that for a second.
9715850	9715930	Okay.
9716471	9717732	Now we know who Good Cool is.
9747136	9748637	Yeah, I was talking Kubota live.
9748937	9749617	That's cool.
9749857	9750417	Good cool.
9751178	9751478	Anyway.
9752138	9754319	But yeah, so, yeah.
9754739	9755219	There you go.
9755319	9758620	I was going to ask how tall he was, but that's kind of a boring question.
9758681	9759301	How tall is he?
9759341	9759701	He's 5'8".
9759721	9760721	He's Japanese, so he's short.
9760741	9761282	I'm almost the same.
9761302	9763903	I think that's more interesting than the blood type question, but you know.
9764103	9764763	Well, okay.
9766223	9766504	What's that?
9767444	9767924	Yeah, he is.
9768004	9769865	He's fluent in French and English.
9769945	9773586	But the blood typing is, that's a common thing, like a Japanese thing.
9773706	9775187	Japanese really care about...
9777378	9777998	I know, I know.
9778019	9778379	Yeah, I know.
9778639	9780180	So, that's an interesting fact.
9780220	9782982	I mean, that's something that is not going to be on everyone else's website.
9783022	9786104	Yeah, when you go to Japan, you don't ask girls, what's your sign?
9786164	9787185	You say, what's your blood type?
9787225	9789046	Oh, and his sign's Gemini, because he was born in June.
9789787	9790407	Yeah, anyway.
9794290	9795010	What's your blood type?
9795130	9796271	Mmm, tasty.
9796932	9800734	You know, I was born in June, and I'm a Cancer.
9801555	9803276	Yeah, well, you are a Cancer.
9803376	9804717	I'm a Cancer on society.
9804737	9805718	Yes, exactly.
9806482	9811303	So that concludes another episode of Orange Crush.
9811904	9814744	This is the end of Orange Crush.
9814784	9818425	We really need to make a real song for it or something.
9818525	9819206	One of these days.
9819486	9820946	I love your version, Rob.
9820986	9821386	Thank you.
9821406	9821826	Thank you.
9821886	9823247	I appreciate that.
9823307	9824147	Your hair's still there.
9824367	9826588	So now we have a little time to kill.
9826808	9827988	Shit, we could have done listless.
9828088	9829448	Actually, no, because we would have had to rush through it.
9829528	9832409	So we're kind of stuck with a little bit of time here.
9832429	9833770	We're stuck with Rob.
9834110	9835010	We're stuck with Rob.
9835856	9846406	I can talk about, uh, something about that, that list of, oh, no, we were talking about what game people would like to see a sequel to, what Final Fantasy game, and I was thinking about this while I was having a cigarette.
9847107	9853172	Um, Matt says Final Fantasy 3, I'm gonna go around and see who, uh, who thinks what, what should be done.
9853813	9860179	So, Rob, what, what Final Fantasy, and this could be any game with the name Final Fantasy in it, do you think should be a sequel, have a sequel done?
9863408	9865610	I'm tempted to say eight, so they can do it right.
9867713	9871897	But honestly, four, if any of them.
9872037	9872618	You geek.
9873979	9877003	I think that's a great choice, because four had a really interesting story.
9877303	9879145	Two in America, yes, for those who... Four was depressing.
9880006	9881607	Yeah, it was pretty depressing, but...
9883357	9888120	It's like, what else could go wrong in my life?
9890202	9892623	Final Fantasy VI, you don't know what happened to Terra.
9892643	9894384	Because she's like my bitch.
9895305	9898167	They need to do a sequel to Final Fantasy VI.
9898187	9900128	They can explain the goddamn ending.
9901409	9906112	Yeah, because it alludes to the fact that when the statues are destroyed that Terra might disappear.
9907253	9907813	But she might not.
9907873	9910435	It doesn't freaking give you any clues to what actually happens to her.
9911334	9916117	Sorry for the lack of spoiler warning, but if you haven't beaten it by now, we figure, you're probably not going to.
9916938	9921981	It doesn't matter if spoilers are given, because that game is excellent, and you should play it no matter what.
9922061	9926084	I mean, as far as RPG games are concerned, you have to play that game.
9926204	9927245	It doesn't really spoil anything.
9927545	9930927	That game is so good, I've had it since it came out, and I have played it like a million times.
9930987	9933069	In fact, just like a couple of weeks ago, I started playing it again.
9933189	9935190	So, yeah, that game is like so awesome.
9936451	9936731	Yeah.
9937251	9938912	Three, or six, whatever, you know.
9939073	9939373	Yeah, maybe.
9945153	9960704	8.
9947875	9960704	They should make 8 because, I don't know, they were talking about making 9 was supposed to be a sequel to 8 where they're gonna have, uh, it was gonna follow around the party of, uh, wasn't it the same, like, Lagunas or something like that?
9960824	9961785	Oh, uh, Laguna?
9962025	9962585	Laguna, yeah.
9962605	9966768	No spoils because we have somebody in the room that hasn't seen the end of 8.
9966808	9970291	I'm talking about Irene here, so...
9970911	9971851	It doesn't have anything.
9972191	9974272	I'm just saying they were supposed to follow around Laguna.
9974372	9976652	Are you talking about 9 before it was made?
9976932	9980273	Yeah, they were talking about like, it was going to be done in the Point of View of Laguna.
9980933	9981333	Oh, weird.
9981793	9984794	I have an interesting rumor that went around when 8 was being produced.
9985114	9989515	The first time, the first bit of information was given out about 8, it was just two pictures.
9989955	9990895	Three pictures, I'm sorry.
9991195	9994235	The logo, a picture of Laguna, and a picture of Squall.
9994456	9995196	Two male characters.
9995636	9996896	And people were looking at the logo...
9997329	9998089	I heard Rinoa had crabs.
9998109	9999310	She probably does at frickin'...
10027751	10033255	Anyway, um, does Jamie have an opinion about, oh, hold on, Rob's going next, hold on.
10033315	10037217	No, I just wanted to say, if they did do that for Final Fantasy VIII, it would be the best video game of all time.
10037257	10038658	Number one on G4's list, baby.
10040219	10042161	I want a Final Fantasy VIII that's good.
10044883	10047324	With much more squall, because squall's pretty.
10048345	10052127	And I want, like, Irvine's selfie, you know, happy.
10054269	10055670	Irvine's cool, he has a gun.
10057670	10059171	I agree with Jamie wholeheartedly.
10059211	10059771	And you know what?
10060532	10062453	I've said many times before and I'm going to say it again.
10062753	10064014	The movie should have been 8.
10064394	10066435	8 should have been the movie.
10068216	10071938	And what he means by that is the story in 8 should have been the actual movie.
10071978	10076320	The one that was with Final Fantasy the movie shouldn't have had anything to do with Final Fantasy at all.
10076460	10077761	Yeah, so, anywho.
10077981	10078821	Kind of like Mystic Quest.
10079081	10082243	Mystic Quest was like Final Fantasy for babies.
10084412	10085773	I'll tell you what Mystic Quest is.
10085973	10088014	In Japan, it's called Final Fantasy USA.
10088215	10088575	Thank you.
10092497	10095559	Do you know what the Final Fantasy VII in America was considered over there?
10096700	10098121	Final Fantasy VII International.
10098981	10100582	I'm playing Final Fantasy X International.
10100883	10107667	Which is like, basically it's as easy as Final Fantasy X, the Japanese version, but in English.
10108656	10110437	and it has a few extra features, I heard.
10110717	10111117	Not really.
10111257	10111817	No, the extra DVD.
10111837	10114959	You can see the difficulty of your sphere grid and that's about it.
10115139	10116479	The DVD, the extra DVD.
10116539	10117420	Mine didn't come with DVD.
10117940	10121282	They were supposed to release a separate DVD when you, maybe it was if you pre-ordered it.
10121462	10123002	That's fine, I've already got it subtitled.
10123122	10126064	It was, it was a, um, like an extra end story.
10126084	10127464	It's you running around being retarded.
10128144	10128525	Okay, well.
10128545	10129025	Seriously.
10129905	10130866	I haven't seen it yet, so.
10130966	10132206	I'll show it to you, I'll copy it for you.
10132326	10136148	But I have it subtitled if anyone on their chat room or... Hold on, what's that say?
10138237	10143280	Okay, now I watched in the show preview video for Final Fantasy X2 on G4.
10143300	10143860	No spoilers.
10144520	10145281	Oh, this is no spoiler.
10145321	10146822	In fact, it makes no sense.
10147582	10151825	The whole video, all it is, is Riona... Riona?
10151965	10152625	Or, not Riona.
10152985	10153706	Yuna?
10153726	10154406	Whatever, Yuna.
10154986	10155947	Some Japanese... Yuna Croft.
10156287	10156927	Yeah, anyway.
10157348	10159869	Yuna... Doing karaoke.
10160469	10161050	Singing.
10161070	10161710	Just singing.
10162110	10163091	Like some pop idol.
10163131	10167113	I'm like... I was watching it... No, she's singing like a pop idol, and I'm watching it going...
10167577	10168737	Are they going to show anything else?
10169618	10172418	No, okay, well this is interesting.
10172438	10187183	Did anybody see the, what was it, the Star Wars, I think it was a Lucasfilm, the little LucasArts computer game intro thing where all the stormtroopers were doing like a dance or whatever?
10187223	10187403	No.
10187463	10188703	I mean, what does that have to do with it?
10188743	10191344	But it was funny, so it's a way to promote the game.
10191364	10192485	It showed nothing interesting.
10194269	10195170	Nothing of the game.
10195530	10198773	They're supposed to be previewing the game to show me, to give me interest in playing the game.
10198953	10201455	All I saw were singing, like, the main theme.
10201535	10205037	Have you seen the Metal Gear Solid 2 commercial in Japan with Gackt in it?
10205058	10205458	No.
10205478	10209121	Has nothing to do with it, but it's Gackt, and so people are gonna be like, No, this has been in our chatroom.
10209681	10212483	It's, we're making fun of the Final Fantasy and other story.
10213384	10218948	And, um, Marin is saying, uh, Yuna's going, Waka, your stomach is fat, lolololol.
10219409	10220490	And he's like, shut the fuck up.
10221330	10222231	Okay.
10222731	10223392	Randomness.
10247304	10249065	Matt says, depends on how X2 ends.
10253768	10254169	Get the book.
10255289	10258211	I haven't given my idea, my opinion.
10258792	10264075	This is where I came up with the idea of asking everybody is because I was out there and I was thinking, what about other games in the Final Fantasy series?
10264640	10267442	I think they should do a sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics.
10267782	10270904	Anybody who's played Final Fantasy Tactics would go, what the fuck?
10270944	10275728	You play the game ten times through, the story is so convoluted that you're just like, huh?
10276068	10277749	Kind of like Mission Impossible 1, but worse.
10279690	10285034	And, I mean, the game was... No, there was a... Matt says there was no story.
10285474	10290938	There was a huge, great, deep story, but you have to play the game so many times, and I think it was kind of...
10291440	10293422	Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Final Fantasy Tactics Advance
10314096	10315537	You're a little kid that gets sucked into... Yes.
10315757	10321239	Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is about a kid in the present day, and he gets sucked into the world of Final Fantasy Tactics.
10321879	10323620	So there's cars and stuff at the beginning.
10323700	10324780	Kids getting sucked.
10325560	10327561	Yeah, does that turn you on, you little pedophile?
10327701	10333784	It would be cool to do a Final Fantasy Tactics, but in, like, the Final Fantasy VII world.
10334664	10338265	There... Well, Cloud showed up in Final Fantasy Tactics, and so there was some... Gay.
10339646	10340366	No, not gay.
10340406	10341867	Cloud was one of the strongest characters, if you...
10343137	10343858	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10364556	10367417	Have, like, a Cloud Vincent Yaoi Fest.
10367437	10368297	That would be awesome.
10369197	10370977	I used to have some good Cloud Vincent Yaoi.
10370997	10379659	Yeah, there is, because they have, in the game, they have a scene where they show Vincent before he got, like, all messed up, and he's, like, in this suit, and he's all, like, you know, suave.
10379719	10384139	Well, what about the whole scene where he goes... I didn't spoil.
10384319	10386620	Cloud goes into that one box... No, no spoiler.
10387900	10392021	What about the scene where, like, Cloud has his shirt off, and he's, you know, walking... Never mind.
10395706	10397067	I wouldn't say that on the radio.
10398748	10402590	I know, I know, I'm just saying what Rice Princess just said, I would not say on the radio.
10403010	10404050	No, Matt, don't say it.
10404691	10404931	No.
10408152	10408853	Shh.
10409573	10410774	Anyway, no, shh.
10411114	10412835	God, Matt, stop it.
10413703	10417445	Okay, Rice Princess is trying to say a bunch of spoilers about Seven.
10417765	10422928	I know that everybody should have already played Final Fantasy 7, but I think there are people that might not have.
10423249	10425870	I'm not giving the microphone to Matt, he's going to ruin something.
10426791	10427071	What?
10427411	10431033	The fact that... Give me the mic.
10431574	10434175	Oh, by the way, Aeris dies, just so you know.
10434895	10437357	That was my favorite part of the damn game.
10438067	10445790	I have my game saved right there so that I can watch her die over and over and over again and I cheer every time.
10446710	10447731	I forgot what it is I call it.
10447751	10467098	You should call it like a scum-sucking crack whore and a homewrecker and a man-stealer because here's why I'm not getting mad at you guys because I'm pretty sure that nobody listening hasn't played the game or had the story spoiled already so
10468237	10470098	I mean, if we had the whole world listening to us right now.
10473081	10474942	Oh, hold on.
10475943	10477104	What did Irene say?
10477124	10481748	She said, what about in the future when they have millions of listeners and they do a rebroadcast of this show?
10481968	10485931	I guess I'm going to have to make this episode just disappear somehow.
10486852	10487592	We'll bleep it out.
10487632	10490895	Sorry, at the end of this episode, we're lost on the way over.
10490915	10492916	So the train animators finished it.
10495874	10501298	Yeah, and, you know, because millions of people are going to want to sit there and tune in and listen to us go, Fuck, shit, hell, whore, porno.
10501678	10502699	Speaking of porno.
10503440	10504801	Uh-oh, we had to get porno in.
10505701	10508824	I saw the best porno of all time this week.
10509704	10510825	Whore of the Rings.
10511105	10511766	I want to see it.
10511866	10512326	Oh, my God.
10512386	10513928	Will you guys bring it over?
10518551	10519652	Oh, it was the best.
10520132	10521373	All I have to say is they have that guy.
10521813	10524475	They have a guy playing golem, and he has a dick for a nose.
10525819	10554763	and don't forget the happy tree jizz the ent that jizzes all over the chick that's supposed to be Frodo yes, so everybody today check out check out Whore of the Rings that's Rob's porn pick of the week thank you oh, Whore of the Rings 2, sorry next week we can have a show without talking about porn well, next week I'm going to be getting my Dance Dance Revolution cosplay porn so, you know, we're going to have DDR Bomani porn
10556434	10557935	That'll be the highlight of next week's show.
10557955	10558875	We'll watch that live on it.
10559536	10561537	Can you try to not open it until next Sunday's show?
10562837	10563998	I don't think you'll be able to resist.
10564038	10564918	I don't think any of us will.
10565218	10571181	It'll be like having the freaking Pandora's box sitting right in front of us with DDR cosplay porn.
10571301	10574823	But we have to watch this on next week's show.
10575683	10576704	Where do you want me to take it?
10576744	10579245	Let's switch mics.
10581806	10582727	I didn't say you could have that.
10588713	10589854	This thing is great.
10590034	10590374	All right.
10590474	10596837	It's a coyote.
10598658	10598998	You know what?
10599418	10601779	Well, does anybody else have a quick topic?
10602359	10604120	Otherwise, I'm just going to go to final thoughts, I think.
10604160	10604700	Boobs.
10605000	10605341	Boobs?
10605361	10606141	You want to talk about boobs?
10606261	10606861	What about boobs?
10607101	10608662	Boobs are funny, but dicks are funnier.
10609442	10610123	Why are they funny?
10610263	10611163	Because they look funny.
10613924	10614265	Why?
10620985	10623807	Anyway... I seriously think that they're funny looking.
10623827	10628290	I'm sorry, repeat that again, Brad?
10628310	10629371	You know what looks phallic?
10630271	10631172	Your shower curtain.
10631272	10634094	What do you think?
10634194	10636436	I mean... Loki bought it.
10637276	10645142	It's... I swear, it looks like... It looks... Doesn't it look like a dick?
10650996	10653677	Great, so everybody's... Yeah, this is great radio, you guys.
10653697	10655858	Rob's shower curtain has a bunch of dicks on it.
10656138	10657219	Loki bought it.
10657719	10658359	No, no, no, no, no.
10658459	10658919	No, no, here.
10659880	10661120	Don't even circle in there.
10661660	10663581	My girlfriend bought that for us, okay?
10668323	10669783	And this does not look like a penis.
10670704	10672564	It looks like a cow or a lock.
10672944	10674445	You're right, it doesn't look like a penis.
10674485	10675505	It looks like several of them.
10677046	10677126	Um...
10678375	10684696	Anybody, I don't know, if you haven't seen it yet, go look at, um, uh, what's his name, Geiger?
10685456	10685636	H.R.
10685676	10686036	Geiger.
10686096	10686656	Look at H.R.
10686676	10687537	Geiger's works.
10688077	10689697	Somebody should make a shower curtain out of one of H.R.
10690057	10691157	Geiger's paintings.
10691437	10696958	The one with all the dicks and vaginas sticking to each other, and it's like a big mosaic thing of it.
10697038	10698639	It's really mosaic.
10699179	10699939	Mosaic.
10701019	10702419	Brad, I think that's supposed to be birds.
10703839	10704840	I think that's supposed to be birds.
10706000	10707280	The birds that turn into more birds.
10709605	10714606	What the hell is up with Enter the Matrix and all the hidden hack stuff in there?
10714926	10716987	Like, they have a whole thing... What was their name?
10717007	10718287	Seraphine or something like that?
10718647	10718847	Yeah.
10719207	10719447	Okay.
10719688	10723508	Anyway, they have a recording of her going, Hello, lover.
10724109	10727489	I have an itch in a place that I cannot scratch.
10728470	10730490	I need your nails on my back.
10731550	10734171	And... I like asparagus.
10734511	10734931	And also...
10738391	10740613	I only have asparagus for lunch.
10741774	10743455	What the hell is that supposed to mean?
10744956	10747298	Because asparagus is penis-shaped, too.
10747398	10747939	I don't know.
10749780	10751502	It is kind of phallic.
10754184	10754504	It does?
10756826	10758607	I don't go around smelling urine, thank you.
10759808	10762531	He informed me that asparagus makes your pee stink.
10762951	10763151	Yeah.
10763171	10764212	It's part of what it is.
10766463	10770527	Okay, I have a late FU of the week that somehow I didn't get before, my bad.
10773289	10777913	Tyrant would like to say FU to my ISP for not allowing me into the chat room.
10778854	10779274	You know what?
10779715	10782958	FU to OtherSideIRC because it's been screwing up all day anyway.
10783778	10789844	FU to my uncanny ability to get to be really great friends with women but not be able to have a relationship with my own.
10790164	10790524	Frown.
10791365	10793447	FU to school, I'm ready to be done, I don't want to do finals.
10797264	10804107	The Game Shits The Calories You Burn While Burninating The Ice Queen I need more alcohol in my life
10822370	10822931	And sex.
10823251	10823911	Lots of sex.
10824071	10824972	What about violence?
10824992	10825633	Then you'll have all three.
10825653	10826953	It's been six months!
10827154	10827634	Boo-hoo.
10828254	10828855	Shut up, bitch.
10830756	10832117	Rice Princess, your final thought?
10832918	10833938	Let's see if we can get a mic over there.
10839262	10842365	It borrows into the ground.
10843065	10844046	That's all I'm going to say.
10848629	10850410	Oh, wait, but that's on the website, isn't it?
10850550	10851211	No, in the game.
10851778	10853439	No, I'm doing a thief.
10855922	10856662	I must not have it yet.
10856962	10857623	Here.
10860866	10862947	Yeah, explanation of that, real quick.
10863428	10869993	Ragnarok Online, the thief class has a skill named Hide, and Ragnarok Online has such bad anguish in it, like the entire script is horrible.
10870774	10874417	It hides by borrowing into the ground, or whatever.
10874777	10875818	Borrowing in the ground.
10876078	10879001	I only like to borrow in the ground, I don't like borrowing above ground, thanks.
10880442	10881463	That's what the hide skill does.
10881843	10883143	Anyway, that's boring, so here.
10883724	10884584	Loki, your final thought?
10885485	10894809	My final thought is, if you're really, really, really, really desperate, I got this really cool pop-up ad today when I was browsing hacker sites.
10895249	10896850	You know, one of those porno pop-ups.
10897311	10904354	Anyways, it's this adult, what was it, like adultfinder or something like that, dot com or something like that.
10904454	10908176	And you go and you register and you can find people that just want to have sex.
10909315	10910256	In your area.
10910496	10912117	And it's gay, straight, everything.
10912197	10913519	That's kind of like Gay.com.
10914760	10918222	Well, yeah, but... You know this from experience, Brad?
10918242	10922906	The problem with Gay.com in Sacramento is that everybody's already fucked everybody else.
10923947	10925428	Doesn't mean you can't have more sex.
10925488	10928291	It's like, what, you have sex once, and then it's like, oh, can't have sex again, sorry.
10928431	10928851	Is that it?
10930132	10930693	That is all.
10931934	10932894	You want me to go, or you want to go?
10933475	10933815	I'll go.
10934276	10936798	I'm going to just take my final thought from AZHB.
10936898	10937198	He says,
10937665	10942226	Asparagus only smells bad if your gene for smelling asparagus-laden pee is dominant.
10943846	10945686	That must be why mine doesn't stink.
10947267	10948127	Your final thought, Jamie?
10953548	10954788	I'm never going to ask her again.
10956248	10960849	My final thought, for real, is... Give me a dollar!
10961829	10963010	Okay.
10963190	10963690	That's it.
10963810	10964590	Thanks for supporting...
10965407	10967168	Thanks for supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
10967628	10969149	I got x-ray vision.
10969989	10971270	Final word.
10972270	10972890	Rice Princess.
10973931	10974491	Final word.
10975451	10975932	Meow.
10977932	10980354	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

10985076	10986936	We expect you a nice play again.
10987417	10990198	And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
10995992	11017790	Extra Cheese Pizza Party at your house, I went just to check it out 19 Extra Lodges, what a shame, no one came Just us, eating all alone
11018140	11035466	You said take the pizza home, no sense letting all this go to waste So then I faced pizza all day and every day This cheese round the clock is getting me blocked And I sure don't care for irregularities
11037079	11041762	Tell me, why'd you have to go and make me so constipated?
11041802	11059333	Cause right now I'd do anything to just get my bowels evacuated In the bathroom, I sit and I wait and I strain and I sweat and I clench and I feel the pain Oh, should I take a laxative or have my colon irrigated?
11060074	11061935	No, no, no
11064975	11081879	I was feeling pretty down, till my girlfriend came around We're just so alike in every way, I gotta say In fact, I just thought I might, pop the question there that night
11082467	11096783	I was kissing her so tenderly, but woe is me Who would have guessed her family crest I'd suddenly spy, tattooed on her thigh And son of a gun, it's just like the one on me
11098274	11102917	Tell me, how was I supposed to know we were both related?
11103037	11111162	Believe me, if I knew she was my cousin, we never would have dated What to do now?
11111382	11120708	Should I go ahead and propose and get hitched and have kids with eleven toes And move to Alabama where that kind of thing is tolerated?
11121049	11122469	No, no, no
11134750	11135351	Tell me!
11157971	11159413	Thank you for watching!
11180052	11184614	Oh no, why'd I have to go and get myself all mutilated?
11184934	11201639	I gotta tell ya, life without a head kinda makes me irritated What a bummer, I can't blink, I can't cough, I can't sneeze But my neck is enjoying a pleasant breeze now Haven't been the same since my head and I was separated Nothing
11209588	11211669	Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.
11241418	11243779	And we're back for the Orange Challenge Afterbirth.

11299140	11300281	I remember vinyl.
11300980	11303762	There's really not a lot to say for Afterbirth, I don't think.
11305703	11307945	Does anybody else have anything they want to say for Afterbirth?
11309906	11311387	They're going to watch this Weird Al thing.
11312048	11316290	Yeah, Rob, I want you to shut the hell up so we can watch Weird Al.
11316851	11320513	I need to get my Saturday Night Fever... Actually, you know what, Matt?

11329024	11331026	Wait, are you actually going to play this?

11415137	11437800	My girl wants to party all the time, party all the time, party all the time My girl wants to party all the time, party all the time I feel like I'm at a wedding and Matt's drunk That'll never happen
11439620	11444121	And that's not even at the reception, that's actually at the actual ceremony.
11444261	11457383	God, Eddie Murphy sucks.
11457563	11463884	This girl has seen me in the club, just hanging out and dancing.
11464624	11465424	Okay, thank you.
11466825	11468505	You are not the next American Idol!
11477126	11478606	New album and a chipmunk album!
11479027	11481487	Hey Justin, I have something from PSYFAM that you don't!
11481527	11482388	That was beautiful!
11501920	11502480	Enough of that.
11502880	11505101	I have to give Rob the biggest high five for that comment.
11505381	11507301	That was comic gold.
11507901	11508701	Oh my god.
11508721	11514702	I gotta go change my shorts, that was too funny.
11514722	11516843	You know what, our afterbursts keep getting better and better.
11517643	11518323	They really do.
11518803	11522124	That started out pretty slow, but that... I think we should end it now.
11522364	11523144	End it while we're ahead.
11526384	11527285	Don't put that on.
11527945	11528085	No.
11531502	11532362	Put on your clothes!
11532442	11533143	Put on your clothes!

11538185	11539705	Okay, wait, we're doing another vinyl?
11542346	11542887	I scare.
11543087	11544287	Is Loki gonna sing along to this?
11546548	11548169	Okay, start your recorders now.
11548489	11550190	Start your recording now, because I'm not recording.
11551110	11557072	I don't know the fucking lyrics to this song.
11557673	11558713	He's gonna get the lyrics.
11558873	11559874	I can't do it without laughing.
11559894	11560634	You have to do this.
11562188	11565009	If you're going to torture us with this music, you have to please sing with it.
11566510	11567650	And then do the speed mix.
11571012	11573573	No, that's... We don't want to use that dog too much.
11575574	11576134	One trick, puppy.
11576494	11576994	Oh, god.
11577014	11578035	Here we go.
11578195	11582756	Are you recording?
11582776	11583917	We have it still on fast.
11586158	11586378	Yes.
11594674	11598376	Why did you make me do that?
11599537	11608603	I don't even know how to... I don't even know when it kicks in because it's... Just take it, Jesus.
11608623	11610944	You didn't play the instrumental version, did you?
11610964	11612545	No, I picked the extended mix.
11622850	11624111	You pick the extended mix.
11624772	11626934	Here, let me fix it.
11628035	11630898	Put it on the other side.
11631678	11632359	Ah, fine.
11633380	11634221	Loki ruining everything.
11634241	11634401	Good.
11634701	11636243	More time for people to start their recording.
11637924	11638465	Ah, here we go.
11638485	11639326	This should probably work.
11639606	11639906	All right.
11640026	11641408	All right, here we go.
11643489	11644410	Is this the real version now?
11644430	11645091	This is the real version.
11645111	11645351	All right.
11645632	11646052	It better be.
11658937	11662620	Yeah, I'm happy because I'm not the one making that ass up.
11662640	11662860	Why?
11663341	11664902	Is this because I want to play my music?
11664942	11665563	Yes, you are.
11665603	11667064	Yeah, where the hell are the lyrics?
11667084	11668205	Loki, your vinyl sucks my ass.
11692463	11699752	Peter Duel, The Blonde Waitress, and take their train spin around and they cross the floor.
11699812	11703737	Oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh,
11712308	11717093	Sing the words, even though the bitch isn't singing.
11717434	11720897	I don't like this song.
11720937	11722959	Here we go, here we go.
11723240	11724962	Walk like an Egyptian.
11725182	11725863	There you go.
11727765	11729406	This sucks.
11729426	11730487	No kidding.
11733070	11734572	I think the extended mix would have been better.
11741656	11742697	Spin the disc, yo.
11743178	11743518	Alright.
11747162	11754910	You're breaking speakers across the internet.
11755611	11761257	Alright, I think now's a good time to put the gun in the perivial forehead of Orange Lounge Radio.
11762188	11763088	Okay, that's it.
11763109	11763689	We're signing off.
11763749	11764489	End of Afterbirth.
11764549	11766090	We're going to kick you now.
11766170	11772133	Since it's six months into the year, June 1st, I think this is a good time to revive our non-stop New Years.
11773254	11773714	So enjoy.
11773734	11777616	We're going to start it off with Zipmania Best and take you out throughout the evening.

11779717	11780677	We appreciate your support.
11780757	11781998	Please whore up our listening hours.
11782038	11782798	We desperately need it.
11782838	11785460	Vote us a 5 and vote Legend of Max a 10.
11785500	11786060	I'm Ben Weisdahl.
11786240	11791723	Remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter and vote for Legend of Trance.
11792332	11792633	What did I say?
11792653	11793394	Legend of Max.
11793935	11794998	Oh my bad, Legend of Trance.
11796621	11800670	Oh, oh, oh, and someone needs to mix me the Sandbone Trio and Max 300.
11800710	11800931	Thank you.
