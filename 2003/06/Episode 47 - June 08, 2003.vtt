00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk and then some.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Yes, I will spank your child.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
If you're not gonna do your job, goddammit, I will.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Well, here's my big opening.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
A sphincter says why?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
I'm super. Thanks for asking.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Oh, you little bitch troll from hell!

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
What am I doing here?

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Ha ha!

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Nooo!

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Eh?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Dodge this.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Mm-hmm.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
This is a tasty burger.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Look, you stupid bastard!

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
You've got no arms left!

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
It's a house?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Look!

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
It's a flesh wound.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Searching for a boy in high school, is that useless?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
It's searching for meaning in a polyshorn way.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Oh, yeah?

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Dark Sakura.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
I ain't got a sniff, but I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
I hate you!

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
We are live, and this is episode number 48 for June the 8th of 2003.

01:38.000 --> 01:46.000
You're tuned in to the Beeee Money Scene's most bitchy radio station of all things Le Money.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts, in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Jamie, Ms. Summers, if you're nasty.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Shut up, I'm watching Transformers.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
You know her better, StarSakura.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
In that corner, say hello to our TechMasa Loki.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Hello.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
I lied, you guys. This is episode number 47, not 48. My bad.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I lost count.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Oops.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
So what? Everybody makes mistakes. Leave me alone.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Go away. Die.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
Also with us tonight, say hello to nobody.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
That's right. It's empty. It's a ghost town here in Orange Lounge Radio headquarters.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
Nobody loves Orange Lounge Radio anymore. I had a cry.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
I missed it.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
They should be the crappiest transformers though when they show the commercials.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
And we're getting phone calls as if we could take calls on the show.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
I'm getting more carrots.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
How rude.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I am being a good girl today.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
How are you being a good girl?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Eating carrots.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
As opposed to?

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Eating candy.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Alrighty.

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
We'll be talking to us, ourselves, since there's no guests here, we'll just be talking to ourselves a little later.

03:10.000 --> 03:17.020
later and first we're gonna take a quick break though featuring some five key

03:17.020 --> 03:25.820
songs fun and this first song is called water flame and it's by K and actually a

03:25.820 --> 03:30.940
buddy of mine Navi he's who's been on the show before he picked up the K album

03:30.940 --> 03:36.100
not too long ago it's pretty cool cool yes so lots of fun stuff coming up

03:36.100 --> 03:40.760
night we're gonna do listless tonight because we haven't done it forever and

03:40.760 --> 03:46.160
yeah so enjoy we'll be back

06:10.760 --> 06:15.760
And I still have a lot of work to do

06:15.760 --> 06:22.760
Oh, but I am, I am

06:22.760 --> 06:24.760
You

07:22.760 --> 07:26.440
Na ikako nakunte arumakega

07:26.440 --> 07:29.600
Na itoshii tetsa mou ichido

07:29.600 --> 07:32.700
Mou tsukouchi anetano te

07:32.700 --> 07:36.000
Mi wo kurei dai

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Thank you

08:06.000 --> 08:07.340
We bout to push that

08:07.340 --> 08:09.160
We bout to punch out now

08:09.160 --> 08:35.380
I'll put you in my

08:35.380 --> 09:03.100
It's more contagious than SARS It's Orange Lounge Radio

09:03.100 --> 09:07.100
That's right. You are listening to Orange Lawn's radio.

09:07.100 --> 09:11.100
And you just listened to a whole bunch of five key songs.

09:11.100 --> 09:13.100
Didn't you enjoy that?

09:13.100 --> 09:18.100
Athletics with Disco Dog, from 7th Mix, before that Love to Me.

09:18.100 --> 09:20.100
Hey, Athletics do it on Please Don't Go.

09:20.100 --> 09:22.100
That's right. Athletics also did War Game, right?

09:22.100 --> 09:23.100
I think.

09:23.100 --> 09:26.100
Before that, the Japanese version of Love to Me, as it's easily called.

09:26.100 --> 09:27.100
It sounds better.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.100
From 3rd Mix. That's debatable.

09:30.100 --> 09:35.980
Before that, GTS featuring Melody Sexton from 4th Mix, brand new world, and starting that

09:35.980 --> 09:39.020
off Kay from 7th Mix with Water Flames.

09:39.020 --> 09:41.420
I can't get my thing to propel open.

09:41.420 --> 09:46.900
That sounds like that Margaret Cho joke, Water's Flame.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.940
So yeah, it's pretty mellow here tonight.

09:48.940 --> 09:54.900
We don't really have a whole lot going on, not a lot going on in the land of Orange Lounge

09:54.900 --> 09:55.900
Radio this week.

09:55.900 --> 09:59.660
Actually, there were a lot of changes that happened at the station on June 1st.

09:59.660 --> 10:02.060
Hopefully they've been invisible to you.

10:02.060 --> 10:05.220
There's been some positive changes and there's been some negative changes.

10:05.220 --> 10:07.600
And this is all due to Live 365.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.660
Positive changes, we've been given a lot more web space.

10:10.660 --> 10:14.160
So we're going to add a whole bunch of new songs.

10:14.160 --> 10:17.340
So Jamie brought me a whole bunch of new stuff to add into the normal playlist.

10:17.340 --> 10:19.460
You get to hear it all tonight.

10:19.460 --> 10:23.260
And yes, I've got some good news and bad news.

10:23.260 --> 10:26.820
The good news is I save lots of money by calling Geico.

10:26.820 --> 10:37.220
So yeah, we're going to have a whole bunch of new stuff in rotation with Monty Music

10:37.220 --> 10:38.220
More.

10:38.220 --> 10:46.540
Bad news is, and this is the weird thing, this is the interesting part, they're tapping

10:46.540 --> 10:53.260
how many live listeners we can have at once, so it's capped right now, yeah they're going

10:53.260 --> 10:58.220
cap our listeners it's capped right now when we're live at a number which we've

10:58.220 --> 11:03.100
only hit during one show ever what well I don't want to say on air but it's it's

11:03.100 --> 11:11.300
that many times okay so we've only ever hit that number once so what what's

11:11.300 --> 11:14.620
gonna happen is if we ever hit that number again what's gonna happen when

11:14.620 --> 11:17.780
you try to connect to the station we're live it's gonna go we're sorry but this

11:17.780 --> 11:21.420
station is too popular and you have to be a preferred member we're sorry that

11:21.420 --> 11:25.420
you have SARS don't worry if you get that message we're gonna be aware of it

11:25.420 --> 11:29.140
that we've hit our cap and what we'll do for the next week will increase our cap

11:29.140 --> 11:31.660
we just don't want to have to pay any more money unless we have to but we

11:31.660 --> 11:34.820
don't want our listeners to pay we're cheap bitches that's right

11:34.820 --> 11:40.740
we take donations you can send this via PayPal now here's the next question is

11:40.740 --> 11:44.780
that they go well if you don't like all of life 365 rules why don't you go

11:44.780 --> 11:48.780
through shoutcast well cast is the suck well it's not necessarily that shoutcast

11:48.780 --> 11:55.580
That sucks, I mean for talk radio it's actually pretty good, but this is the problem, we play

11:55.580 --> 12:00.380
music and the music part you get into that whole licensing thing, now you could get into

12:00.380 --> 12:07.620
like oh well you know you're doing Konami a favor here blah de blah de blah, I don't

12:07.620 --> 12:11.300
think Konami cares the station exists either but let's just not take chances, especially

12:11.300 --> 12:14.220
because we bring you a lot of dance media stuff, the other thing being is that if we

12:14.220 --> 12:18.400
ran a Shoutcast server all the bandwidth would have to come off our personal line here at

12:18.400 --> 12:24.600
the house. I'm sorry, but I'm too busy downloading porn to run a radio station off the computers

12:24.600 --> 12:25.600
here.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.080
I'm too busy downloading transformers.

12:27.080 --> 12:33.720
So that's the reason why we stuck with Live 365 this whole time is that we can suck their

12:33.720 --> 12:39.360
bandwidth away and tough. I just wanted to give you all those little updates about what's

12:39.360 --> 12:40.360
going on with Live 365.

12:40.360 --> 12:43.960
We hope you have a summer to remember.

12:43.960 --> 12:45.960
Now let's uh, let's have a look at some more.

12:45.960 --> 12:46.960
We need an apartment.

12:46.960 --> 12:47.960
Oh my god, our apartment is so lame.

12:47.960 --> 12:48.960
I'm going to read this.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.960
You're going to read the apartment list?

12:50.960 --> 12:51.960
Make a splash this summer.

12:51.960 --> 12:55.960
Whether your ideal of fun is heading out to the ball park, lounging by the pool, or watching

12:55.960 --> 12:58.960
a spectacular sunset, we hope you have a summer to remember.

12:58.960 --> 12:59.960
Enjoy!

12:59.960 --> 13:03.960
They also have a list down there where you can sign up to watch rattlesnakes.

13:03.960 --> 13:05.960
I kid you not.

13:05.960 --> 13:06.960
What?

13:06.960 --> 13:07.960
You're just going to watch them rattle?

13:07.960 --> 13:09.960
What would they do?

13:09.960 --> 13:11.960
Can you eat them?

13:11.960 --> 13:13.960
Let's see here.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.960
Doo doo doo doo doo.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.960

13:29.960 --> 13:31.960

13:31.960 --> 13:33.960
Rattlesnake watching, Seriously,

13:33.960 --> 13:35.960
have we left anything out?

13:35.960 --> 13:37.960
Dude, hang gliding.

13:37.960 --> 13:39.960
I can pretend like I'm in pilot wings.

13:39.960 --> 13:41.960
But I really, really suck in pilot games.

13:41.960 --> 13:43.960
But... But...

13:43.960 --> 13:45.960
They don't have...

13:45.960 --> 13:47.960
Like, rifle shooting.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.960
Skeet shooting!

13:49.960 --> 13:51.960
Does anybody remember that movie

13:51.960 --> 13:53.960
Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Death?

13:53.960 --> 13:55.960
Yes! The dishes are done, man!

13:55.960 --> 13:57.960
The dishes are done, man!

13:57.960 --> 13:59.960
That was the best.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.960
I'm sorry, that movie was the shi... I don't know why I'm thinking about that.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.960
I feel like when she shot the guy in the pants with the water gun, it looked like he pissed himself.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.960
I think I'm thinking of that movie today

14:05.960 --> 14:07.960
because I saw Christina Applegate in a commercial.

14:07.960 --> 14:13.960
Anyway, so now we had our update with what's going on with Live365. Let's get our update with the host.

14:13.960 --> 14:14.960
Jamie, how was your week?

14:14.960 --> 14:20.960
It was a week. I worked. I'm happily getting some overtime now.

14:20.960 --> 14:21.960
Good!

14:21.960 --> 14:22.960
I'm happy.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.960
Anything Romani related?

14:24.960 --> 14:27.960
I suck at 2DX now.

14:27.960 --> 14:28.960
Why do you suck at 2DX?

14:28.960 --> 14:34.960
Because I'm like a month out of serious practice. And I hurt my foot on DDR.

14:34.960 --> 14:37.960
Was that using the pad that I have?

14:37.960 --> 14:40.960
That was playing at the arcade. It was my butt foot.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.960
Since then, my left foot's been swollen and it hasn't fit in my shoe.

14:43.960 --> 14:46.960
Have you been playing with my new dance pad?

14:46.960 --> 14:48.960
And I use the term, my new dance pad?

14:48.960 --> 14:52.960
Not yet, yeah. Hey, over 30 days, it's legal.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.960
There's a whole lot of other drama going on there. We don't get into it.

14:55.960 --> 15:01.960
I will, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'll catch you up later.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.960
That's my new dance pad, and my new third and fourth style.

15:04.960 --> 15:05.960
Oh, yes.

15:05.960 --> 15:09.960
Actually, they're slightly used, but they're mine, and that's what counts.

15:09.960 --> 15:14.960
Is there anything else of yours that I might be able to have that you might not need?

15:14.960 --> 15:17.960
You know, come to think of it, that's about all I made out with.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.960
But I only took some slight losses.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.960
I think the only thing I lost at everything was a Hedwig DVD.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.960
So I kind of had to trade my Hedwig DVD for a...

15:24.960 --> 15:26.960
Oh, cry. I know.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.960
I think I'd have that on VHS anyway.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.960
To get you a new Hedwig DVD.

15:30.960 --> 15:31.960
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

15:31.960 --> 15:32.960
It doesn't matter.

15:32.960 --> 15:33.960
But anyway, DDR.

15:33.960 --> 15:34.960
Yes, you've been enjoying it?

15:34.960 --> 15:35.960
By the way, I made removals.

15:35.960 --> 15:39.400
I had already made my removal from my...

15:39.400 --> 15:40.400
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.400
We're talking about later.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.400
We're talking about later.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.400
Other stuff.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.400
Other stuff.

15:44.400 --> 15:45.400
We're cool.

15:45.400 --> 15:46.400
We don't need to bring down the show with that chatter.

15:46.400 --> 15:51.400
Yeah, you know, if we really wanted to bring things down, we could say twin, but...

15:51.400 --> 15:53.080
Oh, this is great.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.080
This is great.

15:54.080 --> 15:56.440
The other day, I played a joke on Loki.

15:56.440 --> 15:57.440
You know how Loki...

15:57.440 --> 15:59.440
We'll premiere this for you guys in a little while.

15:59.440 --> 16:04.280
joke that one. I got it. Come on, let me tell them. Pretend it was funny. Can you pretend

16:04.280 --> 16:10.280
it was funny for me? It was the most hilarious thing I've ever experienced, ever. That's

16:10.280 --> 16:16.320
right. Orange Lounge Practical Jokes and Bloopers. Okay, this is what happened. Loki made a brand

16:16.320 --> 16:19.360
new remix, and we're going to premiere it for you guys probably during the next break,

16:19.360 --> 16:23.720
right? Yes? Sound good to me? Yes. So we'll introduce that. Well, I guess I have to tell

16:23.720 --> 16:26.960
you what it is in order to tell you the joke.

16:26.960 --> 16:31.960
So the new remix is Gravity, the Dark Sakura Burnination Mix.

16:31.960 --> 16:34.000
It's cool.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.360
And basically what it is, is it's Gravity kind of mixed with like some Rob Zombie.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.480
Like there's a lot of Rob Zombie elements in it.

16:40.480 --> 16:44.720
So what happened is that Loki left.

16:44.720 --> 16:45.720
He went somewhere.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.120
He went to go over to his girlfriend's or something and he left IRC in Orange Lounge

16:48.120 --> 16:51.960
up and I kind of was just like looking, because sometimes I do that, you know, I'll see, oh

16:51.960 --> 16:53.800
Is there anybody talking in Orange Lounge right now?

16:53.800 --> 16:57.560
Should I set myself back from away and join in the chat or whatever?"

16:57.560 --> 17:01.840
And I saw that Loki had said, hey, I finished this new mix, da-da-da-da-da.

17:01.840 --> 17:06.080
And Brad and Irene were over here, you know, Rice Princess and Lanky Style were over here.

17:06.080 --> 17:09.360
And of course, like, Brad being a big Loki fanboy was like, oh, I got to hear that remix.

17:09.360 --> 17:12.800
I'm like, okay, well, now that Loki and I live together, let me just get on the network

17:12.800 --> 17:16.800
and access Loki's computer and find it, because I know where he keeps all his remixes.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.200
So I went in there and played it.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.700
I'm like, and that's when I found out, okay, it's Rob Zombie, it's Gravity.

17:21.700 --> 17:23.820
So I'm getting to a point here, trust me.

17:23.820 --> 17:28.940
So when Loki finally gets home, he walks through the door and I get him, I'm like, oh my god,

17:28.940 --> 17:33.580
for mommy's style, they're having a new remix contest and I heard the most awesome entry.

17:33.580 --> 17:37.620
It's like somebody mixed Gravity with Rob Zombie and it's called the Twin Burnination

17:37.620 --> 17:40.620
Mix.

17:40.620 --> 17:45.180
Loki was not of the amused, but I was.

17:45.180 --> 17:50.620
That joke fell on his face before I stepped in the door and it was just like, guess what?

17:50.620 --> 17:54.620
I heard this new remix. Right away I knew what was going on.

17:54.620 --> 17:56.620
So play it on me.

17:56.620 --> 17:59.620
I was hoping that Loki would be too silly to realize that, you know,

17:59.620 --> 18:02.620
oh, he might have gone on my computer and did it.

18:02.620 --> 18:05.620
But see, Loki knows I'm a big old snoop. Like, no, I wouldn't look at anything else.

18:05.620 --> 18:08.620
Just his remixes. He wouldn't share anything else on his computer, I'm sure.

18:08.620 --> 18:09.620
I'm porn.

18:09.620 --> 18:12.620
Oh, yeah, I'm porn. You do have your porn shared, right?

18:12.620 --> 18:16.620
Um, no, it's not shared, sorry.

18:16.620 --> 18:18.620
Poor Rob.

18:18.620 --> 18:20.300
so mean to me

18:20.300 --> 18:21.560
uh... okay

18:21.560 --> 18:22.340
or

18:22.340 --> 18:25.360
or you would be interested in that

18:25.360 --> 18:28.900
true true or false there is dick and hetero-porn

18:28.900 --> 18:32.780
some hetero-porn

18:32.780 --> 18:34.580
and and and uh...

18:34.580 --> 18:36.360
the um...

18:36.360 --> 18:37.660
what was that

18:37.660 --> 18:40.060
allie mcfeel

18:40.060 --> 18:41.240
what about outta mcfeel

18:41.240 --> 18:43.960
kids one of them

18:43.960 --> 18:46.000
rice princess and lanky style are getting

18:46.000 --> 18:48.840
Through a friend at Rocky Horror, they've been getting all these pornos.

18:48.840 --> 18:50.840
Ally McFeel, Whore of the Rings.

18:50.840 --> 18:51.840
You know Q.

18:51.840 --> 18:52.840
Those are funny.

18:52.840 --> 18:53.840
You know Q.

18:53.840 --> 18:54.840
Yeah.

18:54.840 --> 18:55.840
Q is the guy that looks like Striker's son from X2.

18:55.840 --> 19:01.040
I saw the DVD exchange hands after the potty thing.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.040
Did you see X2?

19:02.040 --> 19:03.040
Yes.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.040
You remember Striker's son?

19:04.040 --> 19:05.040
Yeah.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.040
That's Q.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.040
Oh my God, you're right!

19:07.040 --> 19:08.040
Anyway.

19:08.040 --> 19:09.040
Oh my God.

19:09.040 --> 19:15.960
Okay, since we've been talking about it, why not Let's Play?

19:15.960 --> 19:18.960
play Loki's brand new remix. How's that sound to you, Loki?

19:20.960 --> 19:21.960
Good, I guess.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.960
How's that sound to you, Miss Dark Sakura?

19:23.960 --> 19:24.960
Sure.

19:24.960 --> 19:27.960
Now is this going to be your new F.U. song of the week, or is it going to be...

19:27.960 --> 19:28.960
No.

19:28.960 --> 19:29.960
No? You still like your old one?

19:29.960 --> 19:32.960
Because the old one is...

19:32.960 --> 19:33.960
This one has just the fuck out of it.

19:33.960 --> 19:34.960
That has the stack work.

19:34.960 --> 19:36.960
Yeah, I know. But we can find uses for this one.

19:36.960 --> 19:40.960
Although I've been sort of thinking of another one for my F.U. song.

19:40.960 --> 19:41.960
Oh, really now?

19:41.960 --> 19:43.960
Sort of. I'm working on it.

19:43.960 --> 19:51.960
Alright, so we're going to premiere this for you. This is Loki's, well actually we premiered it last night on The Fuck Off, but this is it's full show premiere. Here it is.

19:51.960 --> 19:56.960
Loki vs. Tack featuring Rob Zombie, Gravity, the Dark Sakura Burnination mix.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.960
Enjoy!

21:56.960 --> 22:18.520
Oops, hi, oops, that was fucked up, Loki Vs. Tack featuring Rob Zombie, Gravity, the Dark

22:18.520 --> 22:23.640
Sacra burnination mix, and let's say hello to our new guest that just arrived during

22:23.640 --> 22:24.640
that little song.

22:24.640 --> 22:25.640
New?

22:25.640 --> 22:26.640
Well, you know.

22:26.640 --> 22:27.640
It's a noob.

22:27.640 --> 22:28.640
You're noob tonight.

22:28.640 --> 22:29.640
Yeah.

22:29.640 --> 22:30.640
It's noob.

22:30.640 --> 22:31.640
Hello, lanky style.

22:31.640 --> 22:32.640
Hey, what's up?

22:32.640 --> 22:35.560
I was just telling you, see the reason why we played that is I was telling the story

22:35.560 --> 22:36.560
about or-

22:36.560 --> 22:40.220
Practical jokes and bloopers about how I joked with Loki last night, except it wasn't funny

22:40.220 --> 22:41.220
at all.

22:41.220 --> 22:42.220
But it was funny to me.

22:42.220 --> 22:43.220
I laughed.

22:43.220 --> 22:44.220
Not last night, the night before, I think.

22:44.220 --> 22:45.220
Whatever.

22:45.220 --> 22:46.220
It was funny.

22:46.220 --> 22:47.220
I thought it was funny because you were so horrible at lying to him.

22:47.220 --> 22:50.720
There's no way, like, as soon as you walked in and said, as soon as you walked in you

22:50.720 --> 22:54.840
said, wow, I heard this awesome reading that you could see the look on his face, like,

22:54.840 --> 22:58.640
Now, I know what he did. He found the hemp-y theme.

22:58.640 --> 23:01.840
Wow, that's exactly what he said ten minutes ago.

23:01.840 --> 23:02.400
Oh.

23:02.400 --> 23:06.360
Well, see? Good minds think, or great minds think alike, whatever.

23:06.360 --> 23:08.760
Say hello also to the Rice Princess.

23:08.760 --> 23:09.480
Hello.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.000
Hello, how are you?

23:11.000 --> 23:11.520
I'm okay.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.040
Orange Crush tonight?

23:13.040 --> 23:15.720
Yep. Yay. For you and Jamie especially.

23:15.720 --> 23:19.400
So she's, Taylor made this one for me and Jamie apparently. Yes.

23:19.400 --> 23:23.080
This should be good. It's a kick in the ass. This should be very good.

23:23.080 --> 23:25.480
So we have that to look forward to.

23:25.480 --> 23:26.480
Stay tuned.

23:26.480 --> 23:27.480
Let's see.

23:27.480 --> 23:28.480
What else?

23:28.480 --> 23:31.480
So, Jamie, did you have anything else you wanted to say about your week?

23:31.480 --> 23:33.720
I kind of cut you off with my whole blooper story.

23:33.720 --> 23:34.720
I'm sorry.

23:34.720 --> 23:35.720
Thank you.

23:35.720 --> 23:36.720
I'm a bad man.

23:36.720 --> 23:37.720
Thank you.

23:37.720 --> 23:38.720
Here?

23:38.720 --> 23:39.720
Now?

23:39.720 --> 23:40.720
Show?

23:40.720 --> 23:41.720
No.

23:41.720 --> 23:42.720
Okay.

23:42.720 --> 23:43.720
I have a cookie.

23:43.720 --> 23:44.720
I have a cookie.

23:44.720 --> 23:45.720
All right.

23:45.720 --> 23:46.720
My week?

23:46.720 --> 23:47.720
Yeah.

23:47.720 --> 23:53.360
My last week was my last week of indulgence before I am a good girl.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.800
And you're going to be on diet?

23:55.800 --> 23:56.800
I was not on diet.

23:56.800 --> 23:57.800
It's a lifestyle modification.

23:57.800 --> 23:58.800
It's a lifestyle modification.

23:58.800 --> 23:59.800
Amen.

23:59.800 --> 24:04.640
I am cutting down to one, because I found out that working where I do, I cannot give

24:04.640 --> 24:05.640
up soda completely.

24:05.640 --> 24:06.640
Okay.

24:06.640 --> 24:08.920
I need caffeine and I need sugar.

24:08.920 --> 24:12.200
I'm cutting to one soda a day and it's balls.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.640
I drink balls at work.

24:13.640 --> 24:16.560
So if you're going to drink soda, why not drink the worst one for you?

24:16.560 --> 24:19.560
No, I'm drinking a little of the most caffeine.

24:19.560 --> 24:21.560
Actually, Joel would be worse than balls, probably.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.560
Much worse.

24:23.560 --> 24:32.560
And then, I am exchanging all of my cookies and fun, sweet stuff for carrots and broccoli.

24:32.560 --> 24:33.560
That's good.

24:33.560 --> 24:37.560
And I'm gonna not eat chocolate that much, I'm gonna have carob.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.560
Ew, carob makes you poo.

24:39.560 --> 24:41.560
Everything makes me poo, Rob.

24:41.560 --> 24:45.560
With my really crappy digestion, I will eat what I can get.

24:45.560 --> 24:47.560
This show makes me poo.

24:48.560 --> 24:50.560
It obviously makes you want to poo because you're in the bathroom.

24:50.560 --> 24:51.560
Oh, there you are.

24:51.560 --> 24:53.560
No, I ran to turn on the A.C.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.560
That's because it's...

24:55.560 --> 24:57.560
No, not after class.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.560
This is fun. Irene entered the room. It just got too hot in here.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.560
I know.

25:00.560 --> 25:02.560
It's getting hot in here.

25:02.560 --> 25:04.560
There's something rotten here.

25:04.560 --> 25:06.560
You better hold your nose.

25:07.560 --> 25:08.560
Alright.

25:08.560 --> 25:11.560
Oh, by the way, I haven't hoarded out the chat room yet tonight, so I probably should.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.560
If you're listening and you want to join in the fun in our chat room

25:13.560 --> 25:16.560

25:26.680 --> 25:32.360
Yes, our LiveJournal community. www.livejournal.com slash users slash Orange Lounge.

25:32.360 --> 25:34.800
Yes, post there, please.

25:34.800 --> 25:40.000
Yeah, we need people to post. Jamie, you need to assign people a topic for this week to

25:40.000 --> 25:44.040
post about in Orange Lounge. You know, like an essay. It'll be an essay project.

25:44.040 --> 25:49.120
Best Bhumani song to fuck to. Best Bhumani song to fuck to. So we want to know in the

25:49.120 --> 25:53.480
Orange Lounge Live Journal community the best Bhumani song to fuck to.

25:53.480 --> 25:58.480
I'm in jealousy. Wow.

25:58.480 --> 26:04.480
Holic. What the hell? No, make sure I'm on the maximum.

26:04.480 --> 26:08.200
That's what they need. That's what they need. They need to have, you know, like how they

26:08.200 --> 26:12.600
We have anime music videos, porno, baumani music videos.

26:12.600 --> 26:16.220
You have the porn up there and you just sync it with the baumani music.

26:16.220 --> 26:19.080
I saw the worst porn ever two weeks ago.

26:19.080 --> 26:20.080
Yes.

26:20.080 --> 26:23.720
It was something that, um, that, uh, Jabberwocky had.

26:23.720 --> 26:24.720
What's that?

26:24.720 --> 26:27.920
We were watching our movie night and, like, I had to leave before the anime actually started.

26:27.920 --> 26:28.920
Uh huh.

26:28.920 --> 26:32.520
But there was some, like, really rotten, horrible, like, camcorder porn.

26:32.520 --> 26:34.520
And this woman had a ward.

26:34.520 --> 26:35.520
No.

26:35.520 --> 26:40.520
It was like trailer trash hooker or something, it was so bad.

26:41.520 --> 26:48.520
And they showed this like shot of her area, and there's a big old wart there.

26:48.520 --> 26:50.520
I was like, ew.

26:50.520 --> 26:56.520
Now, do they have a name? The Wart? No, the Wart, the Wart had a name.

26:56.520 --> 26:57.520
Bubba.

26:57.520 --> 27:05.520
Um, FYI, um, our ever faithful Black Lab, our correspondent for the People's Republic of Texas, uh, Ben and I'll hope you enter here.

27:05.520 --> 27:15.520
He is, um, TM. Trademark. Sorry. Uh, he is posting that in the community right now, so that you, it will not be forgotten.

27:15.520 --> 27:24.520
Anyway, while we were talking about porn and Bamani, I thought this would be a good chance for me to ask Loki about his week.

27:24.520 --> 27:27.520
What about my week?

27:27.520 --> 27:30.520
That was pretty boring.

27:30.520 --> 27:33.520
My girlfriend had her 21st birthday.

27:33.520 --> 27:37.520
She was 21 on Wednesday, so she's happy.

27:37.520 --> 27:44.520
Well, she could have been happier because also for her birthday she got strep throat, so that kind of sucked.

27:44.520 --> 27:47.520
She's still sick, so yeah.

27:47.520 --> 27:50.520
I guess you guys didn't go dancing or some club or something.

27:50.520 --> 27:52.520
We never do that anyways.

27:52.520 --> 27:57.720
go drinking, go to porn strip clubs, oh wait that's 18. She can't drink anyways because

27:57.720 --> 28:04.160
of her disease. Oh yeah, I'm sorry. Anywho. That's no good. But no, we just hung out and

28:04.160 --> 28:10.440
stuff and that's all. But yeah, I'm sure the thing Rob is wanting me to talk about. Tell

28:10.440 --> 28:16.640
us, Loki, tell us. I believe last week we mentioned that I was going to be getting a

28:16.640 --> 28:19.080
certain uh... video coming in

28:19.080 --> 28:25.200
over at ebay coming in and um... this video that i have received and it's funny

28:25.200 --> 28:28.320
is we only missed it by one day too

28:28.320 --> 28:32.080
this video is called dance dance fuck

28:32.080 --> 28:33.880
D D F

28:33.880 --> 28:36.720
EAT ME BACK

28:36.720 --> 28:38.740
it was supposed to be

28:38.740 --> 28:41.580
a uh... bimani cosplay porno

28:41.580 --> 28:43.060
but um...

28:43.060 --> 28:45.300
instead it's not

28:45.300 --> 28:49.300
people in a club dancing and then fucking pretty simple

28:49.300 --> 28:52.620
can you play a little bit for us here in studio and then we could

28:52.620 --> 28:56.300
if you could hook it up to the sound to so at least the I know this is bad radio

28:56.300 --> 28:57.980
but at least they can hear the porn music

28:57.980 --> 29:01.540
the music that goes with DDF because um

29:01.540 --> 29:05.540
it does cut some of it kinda sounds like Max 300 and stuff

29:05.540 --> 29:08.900
yes it's DDF 6 mix

29:08.900 --> 29:12.300
by the way

29:12.300 --> 29:15.200
1.5 I I don't know chicks with dicks episode

29:15.200 --> 29:16.500
I I have no idea

29:16.500 --> 29:21.180
But we're gonna we're gonna hear a little bit here of DDF get it and you guys want to see don't worry

29:21.180 --> 29:25.640
It's it's children safe because it's mosaic so like all Japanese porn so

29:28.620 --> 29:32.620
Rated-r porn it's like porn that would be on vh1 if they ever had porn

29:32.620 --> 29:37.300
So they wouldn't it's like showgirls with the drawdown bikinis. Okay here does the intro screen?

29:37.300 --> 29:43.300
Yeah, the sound should be going through. It's going through the little intros right now.

29:43.300 --> 29:46.300
It looks like DNA. Oh, or not.

29:46.300 --> 29:53.300
It's from Deep Five Studios, it looks like. Or is that Deep? Here it is. Dance, dance, fuck!

30:00.300 --> 30:04.300
And here's the star, Wakabayashi Habayashi or something.

30:04.300 --> 30:07.300
And there's the biggest pair of cameliffs I've ever seen.

30:09.300 --> 30:11.300
And there they go.

30:12.300 --> 30:18.300
To describe the scene for you guys, it's just some chick in a nightclub wearing a bunch of silver.

30:18.300 --> 30:19.300
And rubbing herself.

30:19.300 --> 30:21.300
And she's rubbing and feeling herself.

30:21.300 --> 30:25.300
And then she's just kind of getting screwed by other guys.

30:25.300 --> 30:29.300
And this has nothing to do with DDR. They're not dancing on a DDR pad or anything.

30:29.300 --> 30:30.300
Oh, hey.

30:30.300 --> 30:35.300
Occasionally on the screen it will flash DD, DD Dance Dance Fox 6 mix.

30:35.300 --> 30:36.300
I don't think so.

30:36.300 --> 30:41.300
It dates back in the early 90's except it's like The Grind in Japan on MTV.

30:41.300 --> 30:43.300
That's funny.

30:43.300 --> 30:48.300
Well I think, yeah, Jamie says with fucking, but I think if it was The Grind in Japan there would probably be fucking anyway.

30:48.300 --> 30:50.300
Right on there on TV.

30:50.300 --> 30:53.300
Alright, let's uh, let's give it a head here.

30:53.300 --> 30:56.300
Is this one really any good?

30:56.300 --> 30:57.300
It's not funny.

30:57.300 --> 30:58.300
Hey, that's funny.

30:58.300 --> 31:00.300
I don't know how to do it that way.

31:28.300 --> 31:33.500
absolutely nothing to do with DDR at all except for the fact that sometimes on

31:33.500 --> 31:36.500
the screen it'll flash the title dance dance fuck and they're in a nightclub

31:36.500 --> 31:39.540
and they're dressed like nightclub they're dressed like power chicks

31:39.540 --> 31:44.780
without the boots okay I'm gonna sit over here now that's that's now I'm my

31:44.780 --> 31:52.260
socks camera one what is multi angles I don't know it just says camera one and

31:52.260 --> 31:54.260
And she's dancing.

31:54.260 --> 31:58.260
Her music isn't any good, really.

31:58.260 --> 32:02.260
Now, Loki, what would you say about putting this in a sim?

32:02.260 --> 32:05.260
That'd be hilarious.

32:05.260 --> 32:08.260
You know, I should do that for a random video.

32:08.260 --> 32:11.260
Can I still enter Turnimix 4?

32:11.260 --> 32:13.260
You have four? No, you can't.

32:13.260 --> 32:18.260
Oh, but I'll get to Turnimix 4 later, um, because we've got news on that too, but uh...

32:18.260 --> 32:19.260
Yeah.

32:19.260 --> 32:21.260
Where can I get the soundtrack for this?

32:21.260 --> 32:23.260
It's pretty good.

32:23.260 --> 32:25.260
Oh, oh, we got another song.

32:28.260 --> 32:30.260
This could be Tack.

32:30.260 --> 32:32.260
No!

32:32.260 --> 32:34.260
This sounds like we got the rage on Sunday night.

32:36.260 --> 32:41.260
And again, it's the same girl in the silver dress who's got like...

32:41.260 --> 32:44.260
She's like the slut of the nightclub.

32:46.260 --> 32:49.260
Damn, I wish Tourney McPaw wasn't close because I would so enter this.

32:49.260 --> 32:50.860
I feel like she has such bloody friends with her.

32:50.860 --> 32:53.260
And I'd have this in the background. It's a video, too.

32:54.260 --> 32:55.760
There's always Trini Makes Five.

32:57.160 --> 32:59.760
Coming soon to, uh, screen near you.

32:59.960 --> 33:00.660
Anyway, yeah.

33:00.860 --> 33:02.160
So, dance, dance, fuck.

33:02.460 --> 33:03.160
Kinda sucks.

33:05.560 --> 33:06.760
She's getting tongue now.

33:08.160 --> 33:08.960
That's not...

33:08.960 --> 33:11.360
Ew, that's not even slightly erotic.

33:11.660 --> 33:12.360
At all.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.060
That looks like something out of a sci-

33:14.060 --> 33:14.960
Oh, my God!

33:14.960 --> 33:15.460
No, no, no.

33:15.460 --> 33:19.460
This is a history, I mean an animal planet or something, it looks like.

33:19.460 --> 33:21.460
Discovery Channel.

33:21.460 --> 33:24.460
It looks like something out of a bad sized fiction movie.

33:24.460 --> 33:27.460
It looks like something from hentai anime.

33:27.460 --> 33:30.460
That guy does not know how to make out at all.

33:30.460 --> 33:33.460
He's like, what am I doing here?

33:33.460 --> 33:36.460
I don't care, he's riding me.

33:36.460 --> 33:40.460
Alright, I think we can turn off the bad porn now, thank you.

33:40.460 --> 33:42.460
That looks really awful.

33:42.460 --> 33:43.460
There it is.

33:43.460 --> 33:45.460
You heard it here first.

33:45.460 --> 33:47.460
That's ten minutes of my life I'm never getting back.

33:47.460 --> 33:49.460
Dance, dance, fuck, six mix.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.460
Alright.

33:51.460 --> 33:53.460
So is that all you want to say about your week?

33:53.460 --> 33:55.460
Uh, yeah.

33:55.460 --> 33:57.460
I didn't do too much of them to make a remix.

33:57.460 --> 33:59.460
Um...

33:59.460 --> 34:01.460
What else did I do? I don't know.

34:01.460 --> 34:03.460
I didn't do really much of anything.

34:03.460 --> 34:05.460
Slap.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.460
That's tired.

34:07.460 --> 34:09.460
Um...

34:09.460 --> 34:11.460
Yeah, that's it.

34:11.460 --> 34:14.460
Wow. Okay.

34:14.460 --> 34:17.460
Still trying to get the phones working.

34:17.460 --> 34:20.460
Nah, I don't know.

34:20.460 --> 34:23.460
Find it eventually.

34:23.460 --> 34:26.460
I got a cool hat this weekend.

34:26.460 --> 34:29.460
And I have a shirt with Judd Nelson on it and I'm wearing it.

34:29.460 --> 34:32.460
What a cool.

34:32.460 --> 34:35.460
And I saw pictures of him now from that show that he has.

34:35.460 --> 34:38.460
It was dorky.

34:38.460 --> 34:40.460
Something, Susan.

34:40.460 --> 34:41.460
Suddenly Susan?

34:41.460 --> 34:43.460
Yeah, he plays for the office manager.

34:43.460 --> 34:45.460
I think suddenly Susan's been off the air for a couple of years.

34:45.460 --> 34:47.460
Okay, well I don't watch TV, okay?

34:47.460 --> 34:48.460
Okay.

34:48.460 --> 34:49.460
But he looks dorky now.

34:49.460 --> 34:51.460
I mean, he's so, you know, cute.

34:51.460 --> 34:54.460
But with his haircut he looks really dorky.

34:54.460 --> 34:57.460
And not when he was young and hot.

34:57.460 --> 34:59.460
Breakfast club's cool though.

34:59.460 --> 35:02.460
He looks dorky in a not cool way.

35:02.460 --> 35:05.460
Not like Elijah Wood, you know, he's dorky in a cool way, right?

35:05.460 --> 35:09.460
Lankystyle, since you ruthlessly took the mic away from Jamie, you want to tell us about your week?

35:09.460 --> 35:12.460
My week? Yes, it was week. Haha.

35:12.460 --> 35:16.460
Nah, just same old me, you know, unemployed, playing ragnarok.

35:16.460 --> 35:22.460
Um, let me think, if anything special happened besides the, you know, thing you found out about today.

35:22.460 --> 35:25.460
Tell us about it. You want to tell us about it? Yeah.

35:25.460 --> 35:34.460
Today, I mean, I got an email June 2nd, but it went to my garbage folder, my, my, my fucking junk mail folder for oatmeal because they suck, and they can't decipher.

35:34.460 --> 35:41.460
I usually get the enlarge your penis emails right to my inbox, but all the other stuff that's not junkware goes to my junk folder.

35:41.460 --> 35:44.460
So I didn't check it until today, which is what, the 8th?

35:44.460 --> 35:52.460
Well, I got accepted to be a Final Fantasy XI beta tester, and they're sending me my shit, and that's going to be pretty cool.

35:52.460 --> 35:53.460
On Windows.

35:53.460 --> 35:54.460
Yay.

35:54.460 --> 35:56.460
Yeah, yay is cool. So if anybody...

35:56.460 --> 36:03.460
We can talk about, you know, how the game looks to people, if people listening want to hear, you know, might be interested in getting it.

36:03.460 --> 36:06.780
in getting it yeah I'd be curious so yeah but I don't know what it's gonna

36:06.780 --> 36:13.100
get here so I know Jamie and did you and your fiancee both apply for the ps2

36:13.100 --> 36:17.000
beta and I applied for the windows beta gotcha I can play that while I'm playing

36:17.000 --> 36:19.580
red rock

36:29.500 --> 36:33.440
Irene's Irene saying that she's never gonna see me again because I've got

36:33.440 --> 36:39.440
Do they have a launch date for Final Fantasy XI on computer yet?

36:39.440 --> 36:42.440
No, I don't know. There might be, I just haven't been looking into it.

36:42.440 --> 36:46.440
Because I'm just like, hey, I'm a beta tester, so I get to play it before everybody else.

36:46.440 --> 36:49.440
Well, not everybody else.

36:49.440 --> 36:55.440
But anywho, I don't know anybody else who is. I mean, I think it's just me, Jamie, and Van.

36:55.440 --> 36:57.440
Well, that'd be fun. Good luck to you guys.

36:57.440 --> 36:58.440
You should apply.

36:58.440 --> 36:59.440
It's probably too late now, isn't it?

36:59.440 --> 37:04.280
Well, the email said something about July is when the public beta starts.

37:04.280 --> 37:07.320
So it's like less than a month of closed beta. That's interesting.

37:07.320 --> 37:11.280
Which is kind of weird. So, I mean, you could always play the public beta in July.

37:11.280 --> 37:15.560
Oh, whatever. Yeah, you don't care. You're too popular. No, I'm excited about

37:15.560 --> 37:18.720
Final Fantasy XI. I kind of wish it was on GameCube, because I don't know why.

37:18.720 --> 37:21.560
I just love my GameCube, and I want everything to be on it.

37:21.560 --> 37:22.720
Go to hell.

37:22.720 --> 37:24.240
I'm already there.

37:24.240 --> 37:26.860
Um, listen, you talk about GameCube. Shut up.

37:26.860 --> 37:36.360
My computer, you know what, I just can't play games on my computer, like even when I seem to have a top-of-the-line system, games suck to play on my computer, they really do.

37:36.360 --> 37:39.860
I can't get it out there, but they cost you a little.

37:39.860 --> 37:41.360
I know.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.360
Next week, by the way, I'm bringing over Soul Calibur 2.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.360
Oh yeah, cool.

37:45.360 --> 37:46.360
I've had it for like a month.

37:46.360 --> 37:48.360
I saw the demo at Fry's this week.

37:48.360 --> 37:52.860
The demo doesn't do the game justice, I have GameCube, of course.

37:52.860 --> 37:56.360
I guess I'll talk about my week.

37:56.360 --> 38:01.860
Navi and I decided to go to Fry's on Monday because I wanted to make a random purchase

38:01.860 --> 38:06.420
so I decided I wanted to buy a GameCube game and it came down to two games like we were

38:06.420 --> 38:11.880
looking and we were either going to get Mario Party 4 or Cubivore and I decided to get Mario

38:11.880 --> 38:15.760
Party 4 because I like to be popular and when I get Mario Party 4 people will come over

38:15.760 --> 38:23.040
more and want to play so I bought it and that worked for Friday but Cubivore actually what

38:23.040 --> 38:29.520
What happened is, Navi was so obsessed with Cubivore and the idea of it, he went and freaking

38:29.520 --> 38:30.720
bought it.

38:30.720 --> 38:35.080
And it's actually pretty cool, because you get to eat things.

38:35.080 --> 38:38.840
You ruthlessly tear the tails off of little cube snakes and stuff.

38:38.840 --> 38:44.480
It's kind of like a mix between Facebook 2000, except everything is cubes in 3D, and EVO,

38:44.480 --> 38:48.600
that old SNES game, where you kind of evolve, you eat things, you get experience points

38:48.600 --> 38:50.360
and you can evolve.

38:50.360 --> 38:52.600
But everything's still cubes, so it's kind of weird.

38:52.600 --> 38:59.600
It's very interesting. I especially love the screen where you have to go mate because you have to mate to have offspring to get more limbs, I guess.

38:59.600 --> 39:01.600
It's kind of complicated. Well, not really.

39:01.600 --> 39:05.600
But it's funny because it says, like, you attracted five females.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.600
And then it says, would you like to mate? Yes or no?

39:07.600 --> 39:11.600
The mating scene in Cube of War is, like, the best thing I've seen in any video game in the past year.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.600
I just love the question. Would you like to mate? Yes or no?

39:13.600 --> 39:15.600
Would you like to mate? Yes or no?

39:15.600 --> 39:17.600
If a guy's playing the game, who's going to answer no?

39:17.600 --> 39:20.600
I mean, those are some pretty hot cube chicks.

39:20.600 --> 39:26.600
And then at the end he says, I mated with five females.

39:26.600 --> 39:29.600
And I had three kids, or three of the females had kids.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.600
Sounds like an episode of Jerry Springer.

39:31.600 --> 39:35.600
Yeah, it's Cube Springer, Jerry Springer.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.600
So Rice Princess, how was your week?

39:37.600 --> 39:39.600
Oh, sorry.

39:39.600 --> 39:42.600
Everything was always, oh, I started a diet on Monday, but that's about it.

39:42.600 --> 39:43.600
How's your diet going?

39:43.600 --> 39:44.600
It's been going pretty good.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.600
I think I lost like five pounds.

39:46.600 --> 39:48.600
Congratulations on all of that.

39:48.600 --> 39:50.600
Yay.

39:50.600 --> 39:52.600
Oh my god.

39:52.600 --> 39:55.600
Other than that, it's been pretty boring.

39:55.600 --> 39:58.600
I think I need to go on a lifestyle change.

39:58.600 --> 40:01.600
Yeah, it's not a real diet sort of thing.

40:01.600 --> 40:04.600
It's a lifestyle change.

40:04.600 --> 40:07.600
Okay, that's good.

40:07.600 --> 40:09.600
Yeah, and that's about it.

40:09.600 --> 40:10.600
Boring old me.

40:10.600 --> 40:14.600
Alright, so anybody else have anything they want to say here during the first little bit of show?

40:14.600 --> 40:18.600
I actually have been going on a while now, but anybody else have something we want to add to the conversation going on right now?

40:18.600 --> 40:21.600
Um, I'm cool.

40:21.600 --> 40:22.600
Okay.

40:22.600 --> 40:24.600
Everyone wants to be like me.

40:24.600 --> 40:25.600
Okay.

40:25.600 --> 40:26.600
Sure, Jamie.

40:26.600 --> 40:27.600
Okay.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.600

40:29.600 --> 40:31.600
I'm sorry.

40:31.600 --> 40:32.600
Okay.

40:32.600 --> 40:37.600
I think we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to start this break off with...

40:37.600 --> 40:38.600
Guitar Freaks.

40:38.600 --> 40:39.600
What?

40:39.600 --> 40:40.600
Guitar Freaks.

40:40.600 --> 40:41.600

40:41.600 --> 40:42.600

40:42.600 --> 40:43.600
Guitar Freaks.

40:43.600 --> 40:50.440
I wanted to play one more song real fast, but since this is graduation week for a lot

40:50.440 --> 40:54.440

40:54.440 --> 40:55.440

40:55.440 --> 40:59.120

43:01.420 --> 43:03.420
People don't matter

45:01.420 --> 45:09.420
Down around the corner, I head for my phone here

45:09.420 --> 45:13.420
To see that long train run, watch them disappear

45:13.420 --> 45:18.420
Without love, where would you be now?

45:18.420 --> 45:27.420

You know they're running late, without love Where would you be now, nah, nah, nah Without

45:52.300 --> 46:04.340
And the wheels go round and round, and the steel rail back holding hard, and the miles

as they go down.

46:07.340 --> 46:09.340

46:11.340 --> 46:16.340
Without love

46:19.340 --> 46:23.340

48:27.340 --> 48:29.340

48:29.340 --> 48:30.340

48:30.340 --> 48:32.340
Did you have a question?

48:32.340 --> 48:34.340
Well, yes, actually I wanted to know...

48:34.340 --> 48:38.340
Can I please have your first name only and your birthdate, please?

48:38.340 --> 48:43.340

48:43.340 --> 48:45.340
Alright, go ahead.

48:45.340 --> 48:48.340
Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?

48:48.340 --> 48:50.340
Is he incarcerated?

48:50.340 --> 48:54.340
Uh, actually, no he's not, but what do you think of the ever-ranty dark sakura?

48:54.340 --> 48:57.140
Hi, dear, how are you? I love you.

48:57.140 --> 49:00.340
I see you two must know each other. Well, what do you think of Sky?

49:00.340 --> 49:02.540
Did he used to play football when he was in high school?

49:02.540 --> 49:04.040
Well, actually, no he didn't.

49:04.040 --> 49:05.140
Ha ha ha ha!

49:05.140 --> 49:07.440
Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?

49:07.440 --> 49:11.240
I want you to really remember the pill, all right?

49:11.240 --> 49:13.540
I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly.

49:13.540 --> 49:17.140
And I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.

Hello?

49:48.740 --> 49:50.740
Huh huh?

49:50.740 --> 49:53.740
We hope you enjoy our cheesy little promos.

49:53.740 --> 49:57.740
Uh, Jamie threatened in her live journal today to make some new ones this week. I'm excited.

49:57.740 --> 49:58.740
I did?

49:58.740 --> 49:59.740
Yeah, you said you wanted to make a promo.

49:59.740 --> 50:01.740
Oh, that's right. I did.

50:01.740 --> 50:03.740
Hey, go for it, dude.

50:03.740 --> 50:05.740
The dudette.

50:05.740 --> 50:06.740
Jamie.

50:06.740 --> 50:07.740
Okay.

50:07.740 --> 50:11.740
I want to make a couple more celebrity interviews, too. I gotta call some people and get more celebrity interviews.

50:11.740 --> 50:13.740
Cause that was fun interviewing Miss Cleo.

50:13.740 --> 50:15.740
I might try to get some mufflers.

50:15.740 --> 50:19.740
She's... Hey, hey, hey, hey! Stop it with some gibber!

50:19.740 --> 50:23.740
Oh, yeah! Actually, Brad does a really good impression of myself.

50:23.740 --> 50:27.740
I am very sad. Why? Because Miss Elizabeth is dead. Who's Miss Elizabeth?

50:27.740 --> 50:31.740
She was much of his wife, like, in the 80s.

50:31.740 --> 50:35.740
I don't follow wrestling.

50:35.740 --> 50:39.740
And they have what you really can't stand. What? What?

50:39.740 --> 50:43.740
We're doing wrestling drama. Oh, alright, alright. Whatever.

50:43.740 --> 50:46.740
Shall we get to the FUs of the Week?

50:46.740 --> 50:47.740
Yeah.

50:47.740 --> 50:48.740
Do you want the new song?

50:48.740 --> 50:49.740
New.

50:49.740 --> 50:50.740
You want the new one?

50:50.740 --> 50:51.740
Alright.

50:51.740 --> 50:52.740
Here we go.

50:52.740 --> 50:55.740
It is now FU of the Week time.

50:55.740 --> 50:58.740
And what is this FU of the Week thing all about, Jamie?

50:58.740 --> 51:01.740
Where we get pissed off and tell you about it.

51:01.740 --> 51:22.580
The first one goes towards the stupid bit she was in front of me driving.

51:22.580 --> 51:26.820
She was obviously drunk and she would, true to the law says you have to stop a full car

51:26.820 --> 51:30.700
link behind the person in front of you at a stop light, but who follows that anyway?

51:30.700 --> 51:35.740
And she was stopping and then she was like driving all twitchy so I just had to speed

51:35.740 --> 51:36.740
around her.

51:36.740 --> 51:37.740
She was just stupid.

51:37.740 --> 51:41.340
And then her question in the seat next to her was obviously on E. She kept putting her

51:41.340 --> 51:45.060
hands in the air and then trying to hug the girl in the front seat.

51:45.060 --> 51:48.460
And then, uh, it's like having SARS.

51:48.460 --> 51:52.900
The whole beginning of this week I was so sick, it was my allergies.

51:52.900 --> 51:57.260
And thanks to, uh, free gifts from Allegra and Claritin B, I was all better.

51:57.260 --> 51:59.140
But yeah, it sucked.

51:59.140 --> 52:04.340
I didn't have a voice, but I work in freaking customer service, so what's up?

52:04.340 --> 52:11.500
And then another one goes to not having, you know, money and stuff, and my breaks, which

52:11.500 --> 52:13.760
grind.

52:13.760 --> 52:17.260
And I think that's about it.

52:17.260 --> 52:20.300
I'm not really all that angsty that machine works, that's my life, that's sort of happy

52:20.300 --> 52:21.300
right now.

52:21.300 --> 52:23.300
Aww, that's so cute, bleh.

52:23.300 --> 52:25.940
Bite my ass, fuck you.

52:25.940 --> 52:28.220
See, I can get you ready.

52:28.220 --> 52:37.060
And another one goes to Rob, and another one goes toward all of these communities I'm a

52:37.060 --> 52:42.660
member of, just about, in my life journal, because I'm taking them all off, because people

52:42.660 --> 52:44.100
just post really stupid stuff.

52:44.100 --> 52:51.080
I'm leaving up the DDR and Bamani communities, but like, you know, this has been some stupid

52:51.080 --> 53:20.240
I'm on this roleplay board, and there's this guy being all god-mode-y, I hate god mode

53:20.240 --> 53:25.960
RPG players hate it when especially when you're not doing anything with a set

53:25.960 --> 53:29.380
combat-based rule and he's like oh I just had me appear there and you're blah

53:29.380 --> 53:33.200
blah blah I'm like okay and wearing a professional suit and then feels like

53:33.200 --> 53:36.600
well you've been here a month ago you wouldn't know blah blah blah okay so he

53:36.600 --> 53:40.200
got smacked down by one of the admins on the board so that made me feel all happy

53:40.200 --> 53:45.840
and justified and I couldn't help rubbing his nose in it so did he have an

53:45.840 --> 53:50.080
ogre slaying knife maybe that's why I got an ogre slaying knife as a plus

53:50.080 --> 53:57.200
money against ogres you're not even there you're getting drunk okay no no it

53:57.200 --> 54:02.720
wasn't that he's just being stupid I I really really and I another thing

54:02.720 --> 54:08.280
people who have their live journals and cannot use paragraphs or complete

54:08.280 --> 54:13.120
sentences unless you're doing it on purpose and that that's the case stop

54:13.120 --> 54:20.960
all right there and the city's people are really you know nice be a really

54:20.960 --> 54:26.200
nice going out over here great people that I know I love you to death but

54:26.200 --> 54:31.800
please use grammatically correct sentence structure when you post in your

54:31.800 --> 54:36.880
live journal and also for people who put humongous posts you know I understand

54:36.880 --> 54:41.440
that's fine I do it too but there's such a feature called LJ cut it's a really

54:41.440 --> 54:48.440
easy girl to remember. You can even go onto the FAQ page and cut and paste. Wow! Do it!

54:48.440 --> 54:54.440
Okay, I'm done. Wow. I could name names, but I won't. I'll just tell them their face later.

54:54.440 --> 55:01.440
Logie. Sorry for messing with the phone. I forgot to connect it through the sound board.

55:01.440 --> 55:05.440
Yeah, we want to hear your conversation that you're going to have. I was trying to, because

55:05.440 --> 55:09.440
I fixed something. I was seeing if it worked. I was calling my voicemail to see if it could

55:09.440 --> 55:12.440
as if it left a message that meant the phones were working.

55:12.440 --> 55:14.440
So Matt's first fuck you goes to Brad.

55:14.440 --> 55:17.440
No, I'm not that mad this week, actually.

55:17.440 --> 55:20.440
Um, first, uh, slight, okay.

55:20.440 --> 55:22.440
First F.U. of the week, not really an F.U. of the week,

55:22.440 --> 55:26.440
kind of like I'm laughing at you because you're stupid type of thing.

55:26.440 --> 55:30.440
Um, I'm gonna laugh at, uh, the stupid bitch that I mentioned last week.

55:30.440 --> 55:33.440
Because, hi, you're licensed, you have to take a picture.

55:33.440 --> 55:36.440
You have to take the stupid veil off, you stupid bastard.

55:36.440 --> 55:40.440
Go home! Go back to your country, you freaking Al-Qaeda!

55:40.440 --> 55:45.440
Anyway, so, um, enough of that, and, um, let's see, what else?

55:45.440 --> 55:51.440
Um, I have to use the stupid phone program in that war game because I can hear the phone, but I can't talk.

55:51.440 --> 55:57.440
I mean, it's kind of cool and all, but I like to talk, and that would be cool.

55:57.440 --> 55:59.440
Uh, what else?

55:59.440 --> 56:06.440
Um, I don't know, that's good for not having that many good files coming out lately, freaking sim files.

56:06.440 --> 56:13.440
Um, also the fact that terrible Mr. Grinshaw was out today. Oh yeah, terrible Mr. Grinshaw came out today, yay.

56:13.440 --> 56:22.440
Um, also all these phone programs that are, you know, for making phone calls on your PC that claim to be free, but they're not.

56:22.440 --> 56:28.440
I hate that. Why even say they're free if you're not going to make them free if you have to pay money to use the phone for free?

56:28.440 --> 56:37.440
I don't know. I'm not that smart and all, but paying money to use the phone for free is just paying to use the phone.

56:37.440 --> 56:44.440
That's like saying, well, you're paying the 35 cents to use the pay phone as a right to use the phone for free. Makes no sense.

56:44.440 --> 56:55.440
That's it. I really didn't have anything because I've been kind of like busy with other stuff. Yeah, I just really haven't been paying attention.

56:55.440 --> 57:11.440
My F.U. of the week goes to X's that screw your friend in the shower message. Short symbol to the point.

57:11.440 --> 57:14.340
What's your point?

57:14.340 --> 57:18.260
Brad, anything?

57:18.260 --> 57:19.260
Sorry about that, Ross.

57:19.260 --> 57:22.260
That's alright, it happens.

57:22.260 --> 57:23.260
No hard feelings there.

57:23.260 --> 57:26.700
He just didn't fall into the penis.

57:26.700 --> 57:27.700
Let's not drag it out.

57:27.700 --> 57:28.700
It's true.

57:28.700 --> 57:29.700
His hand landed there.

57:29.700 --> 57:30.700
Twenty-five.

57:30.700 --> 57:31.700
Twenty-five.

57:31.700 --> 57:32.700
Up and down.

57:32.700 --> 57:41.300
Okay, um, I'm glad Loki brought that up about the crazy

57:41.300 --> 57:45.380
lady who won't take her veil off because I wanted to expound on that, that's a word right?

57:45.380 --> 57:50.100
Hold on, hold on, before Matt gives it, because I wanted to say something last time you brought

57:50.100 --> 57:53.020
up like two weeks ago and I forgot and I think it really does it justice, I don't know if

57:53.020 --> 57:56.840
people know but in this country, especially in California, just anywhere in the country

57:56.840 --> 58:03.940
in America, driving, having a driver's license is a privilege, not a right. You don't have

58:03.940 --> 58:08.660
the right to have a driver's license, it's something you have to strive to get, you know,

58:08.660 --> 58:13.940
have to go do it and it's just a privilege so if you're not you know you can't fucking sue

58:13.940 --> 58:17.220
i don't know if they are suing but i would be surprised they're trying to sue the country for

58:17.220 --> 58:21.940
not letting her have her fucking license picture taken or having a license but you can't do that

58:21.940 --> 58:27.140
because it's not your right we're not infringing on your rights as an american or as a as a

58:27.140 --> 58:32.500
alien legal alien or as an alien because it's not your right to have a license fucking follow the

58:32.500 --> 58:38.900
rules. Retard. Oh, and another thing. All these people who are crossing the border from

58:38.900 --> 58:43.740
Mexico and stuff, who are getting killed because they're breaking the law. No, I'm not racist,

58:43.740 --> 58:48.620
I'm just saying. We have a law that says you can't try to, you know, you have to come in

58:48.620 --> 58:53.100
an illegal way. If you do it illegally, you're a criminal. And if you are a criminal by doing

58:53.100 --> 58:57.820
it illegally and you get hurt doing it, you can't sue our country, which has been happening.

58:57.820 --> 59:00.980
Because you're, you're a freaking criminal in the first place for breaking an American

59:00.980 --> 59:01.980
I don't know.

59:01.980 --> 59:02.980
I'm...

59:02.980 --> 59:03.980
Ugh!

59:03.980 --> 59:04.980
Anger.

59:04.980 --> 59:05.980
Okay.

59:05.980 --> 59:06.980
What did you say, Matt?

59:06.980 --> 59:07.980
Uh...

59:07.980 --> 59:08.980
MTV Music Awards are on.

59:08.980 --> 59:09.980
Anyways, um, no.

59:09.980 --> 59:13.980
My Effie of the Week, actually, I forgot, is for stupid movie sequels.

59:13.980 --> 59:16.980
For God's sake, stop making stupid...

59:16.980 --> 59:17.980
I'm kidding.

59:17.980 --> 59:20.980
Stop making Brad get to sing.

59:20.980 --> 59:25.980
Like, for instance, Legally Blonde 2.

59:25.980 --> 59:28.980
I didn't want to watch Legally Blonde 2.

59:28.980 --> 59:32.980
I didn't want to watch Legally Blonde 1. I don't want to see a sequel of it.

59:32.980 --> 59:34.980
They're talking about making it Back to the Future IV.

59:34.980 --> 59:39.980
They ended it fine, and now they're making it Back to the Future IV.

59:39.980 --> 59:40.980
Back to the Future IV.

59:40.980 --> 59:46.980
Not only will the two directors not be back for it, but Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox will not be in it.

59:46.980 --> 59:47.980
Oh, I was going to say, maybe-

59:47.980 --> 59:48.980
And it might be animated.

59:48.980 --> 59:52.980
I was going to say, does he go back in time when he didn't have Parkinson's disease or whatever?

59:52.980 --> 01:00:00.980
I was supposed to go back to 1985, but my hand was shaking so much that I went to 38.5.

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:04.980
It was a hijinks that ensued.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.980
This is wacky fun for the family.

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:13.980
You said hijinks, that's funny.

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:19.980
Yeah, he wouldn't be so good at that gun game anymore.

01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:21.980
Yeah.

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:22.980
What?

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:24.980
Uh, yeah, I'm done.

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:30.980
Wouldn't a superhero movie with Christopher Reeve and Michael J. Fox be great?

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:34.980
It would be The Adventures of Handyman and the Tiny Avenger.

01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:37.980
Alright, um...

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:41.980
Uh, let's see, Rice Princess, do you have anything you'd like to, uh, F you today?

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:55.980
I don't really have anything that I'm post-op about. Can I do a love you of the week?

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:58.980
Yeah, you can do a love of the week. Do we have love yous of the week?

01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:06.980
Yeah, sure, why not? I give my love you to Rob because he bought me that Dog of Glee notebook and it was so cute. Thank you so much. It was so great.

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:09.980
Oh, it's the Movie Awards or whatever?

01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:12.980
They're parodying the Matrix here at the Movie Awards.

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:16.980
And I love you too Brad, cause he's cool.

01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:17.980
Aww.

01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:19.980
I love you too. This is really weird.

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.980
And they have Wanda Sykes as the Oracle.

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:22.980
Matt? Matt?

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:27.980
Matt turned on the MTV Awards Matrix thing.

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:29.980
Justin Timberlake is some sort of like...

01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:34.980
I wanted to see this. For the Movie Awards this year, they did a parody of the Matrix reload.

01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:40.980
And I really wanted to see this. I'm sorry that I've broken the FUs. I'm sure people can go ahead and, uh, yeah.

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:43.980
Well, let's continue on with the FUs.

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:45.980
FU to the MTV Movie Awards, Paul Sham.

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:51.980
Justin's really dancing. Like, he's doing the Matrix stuff. He's dancing.

01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:56.980
Alright, uh, let's go to the chatroom FUs. Are you done with your, uh, love yous, Irene? Okay.

I don't feel like waiting until November because it was so good.

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:43.380
Fuck the Six Flags near me because they had to get rid of their four extremes because some bitch complained about the word bitch in it.

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:47.380
Okay, nobody even heard that at all.

01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:55.380
I'm sorry, we're kind of sidetracked by watching Sean William Scott playing Mr. or I'm sorry, Agent Smith.

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:59.780
I want to come back to that later and make a little topic out of that. That was interesting

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.080

Fuck exams this week and I don't normally say this because there is a reasoning for exams

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:15.720
But everyone is running around like chickens without dicks trying to remember everything and it's really annoying. So fuck them

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:42.080

F you to the pains of cleaning out a house.

And lastly, huge F you to Dell, because my 19 inch CRT died.

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:22.740
And not only that, but so did my DVD plus RW drive.

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:24.600
It won't burn DVD-R anymore.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.400
Oh sure, RW works fine, but R is much cheaper.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.120
F you Dell.

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.600

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.120
It says O after that.

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:36.700
I think you meant to type or else.

01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:40.040
Dude, you're getting a broken Dell.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:45.040
Dude, you're getting a dump.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.040
Anyway.

F you to summer school, says Nico Adachi.

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:53.040
That would suck if you have to go to summer school, I'm sorry.

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:59.040
Akuma GM would like to say F you to my infernal MP3 player that decided to go on the blink.

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:02.040
You used to work so well until you started to skip for no reason.

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:06.040
Did you set MP3 player I stab at thee?

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:10.040
Why didn't any of you play anyway? I should just get a CD player that can read MP3s on a CD.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.040
You know, I don't read minds.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.040
I would just like to share.

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:20.040
Alright, moving right along, we have the 23rd Magus's FUs.

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.040
FU to graduation rehearsal.

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:28.040
Four hours stuck in the football field in the hot sun, just because 200 fucking seniors can't walk and step.

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:30.040
It's Johnson, so they have to pimp strut.

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:33.040
Sun burnination.

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.040
That's a new word.

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:38.340
new word. F U to me for being such a damn glutton and ordering the biggest sundae they

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:42.760
have at leather bees in celebration. Perps. F U to summer visitation. I don't want to

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:48.760
go to Kentucky. God damn it. Looks for lawyers, damnedest they are.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:54.760
DDR Angel would like to say F U to the egotistical bitch co-worker for making me work for her

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:59.880
tomorrow. Oh wait, more money for me. Well, still F U to her for being an egotistical

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:27.880
I'm doing the show by myself right now, apparently, because the others have more important things to watch.

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:32.880
Oh, Rob, I'm listening. I'm adding to the show, I think.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.880
Oh, that was funny. Ha ha ha.

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:38.880
I'm kidding.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.880
Hey, Rob, I think we should go to a break.

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.880
No, that's okay. I'm still waiting for one more F.U. to come in.

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:47.880
I'm just gonna wait one more time, and I'm gonna uncheck my world of pain all over your candy ass!

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:48.880
Ergo!

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:51.880
Feast of me, concordantly!

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:55.880
Justin?

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:56.880
Yeah?

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.880
I apologize.

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:33.840
So we'll be back after this potpourri of Bahmani music. Enjoy boys and girls.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.200
I'm drunk and afraid from a little bit's diming

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:04.400
Who knows how to dance in such a timing

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:08.140
There's black lights starring no coke floor

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:08.640
So what?

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.640
A council fighter in a disco

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:12.000
He's out to take his chance

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.100
He knows the runny's in the house

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:14.340
Only coke for romance

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:14.980
What's the floor?

01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:16.320
He's got a white suit on

01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:17.240
Fight's passed on

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.980
And the night has just begun

01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:21.060
It's when he lays it on with his style

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:22.960
A ladies mad with a nice smile

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.900
The night before his eyes

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:27.000
He's a pretty old thing lookin' real swell

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.400
He wants to make me score

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.660
so he takes a hribe and leads her to the dance floor

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:32.660
He's even in line after line

01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.260
She tells you that he looking real fine

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:37.200
Cause he's a man perfect cheerful

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:27.700

01:13:50.880 --> 01:14:00.880
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:04.880
We are back, and you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:11.880
And Brad's flashing me liquor. He wants me to start drinking. You know, I already got pretty toasty last night.

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:15.880
I don't know if I need to get drunk again. We'll see.

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:19.880
I don't know.

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:21.880
I don't know.

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:25.880
I can have one. I'm not going to go outside. You know what, Brad, bring me one.

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:30.880
I can have one. One will loosen me up a little bit. One or two or ten.

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.880
Usually with Rob, one leads to two or four, eight, twenty-seven.

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:38.880
Don't carry an open container in the car.

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:42.880
Yeah, you can take one home with you.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.880
I don't want to drink something before I'm driving.

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:46.880
I'm responsible.

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.880
Don't drink and do radio, kids.

01:14:58.880 --> 01:14:59.880
I'm not underage.

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:01.880
If you're underage, you must have your parent's permission to drink.

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:05.880
Although people at restaurants seem to think that I'm like 18.

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:07.880
I don't look 18.

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:12.320
Have you ever been carded in an R-rated movie?

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:16.440
Yes. That shit would piss me off. How did you

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:20.000
you look like... Oh! What? Oh!

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.120
I have good news. Uh-oh. This is more centered toward

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:27.840
Loki. Remember when we went to see The Matrix?

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:32.080
And remember that crap with the thing and the credits? Guess what?

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:36.960
I got six bucks from the movie theater

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:43.100
And a two dollar off coupon. How'd you get six bucks? I gave them my ticket and told them what happened

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.680
You should do that. You'll get money

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:52.640
They turned on the lights and turned on and into the movie

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:57.160
And then they turned it back on but didn't they turn the lights off

01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:03.200
You mean like before the trailer came on like during the credits of the end, right?

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:07.200
Alright, so when Mara and Sean was in town, we went to see X-Men 2.

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:13.200
And so I was just thinking, you know, so I have that ticket, and I personally wonder if they would, you know, give me like a movie pass or something.

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:18.200
So I went and told them about it, and they gave me money off of another movie ticket, and then they gave me money.

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.200
Cool.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:22.200
I'm like, okay, you should totally take your ticket there.

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:25.200
It's like we never saw the movie because they never tore our tickets.

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:31.200
Yeah, we just walked right by them because we got their, like, I guess there was this, what happened was we were thinking,

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:35.800
I was thinking of getting fan dango tickets the night before, buying one line but I was

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:38.160
like, you know what, maybe there will be– I don't know.

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:41.580
I don't want to wait in line at a huge line if a whole bunch of people bought fandango

01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:42.580
tickets or whatever.

01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:45.580
Because then you have to wait in a fandango tickets, or whatever, you know?

01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:49.340
I went there early and there have to be two other showings happening that weren't pulled

01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:51.340
the night before.

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:53.160
We got these two howings that nobody had tickets for because everybody bought fandango tickets.

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:58.260
And so we went in there, and there was no, what do you call the person who PLAYED THE

01:16:58.260 --> 01:16:55.940
PHOTOGRAPHER SO

01:16:55.940 --> 01:17:00.940
And there was no, what do you call them, the person who, the chauffeur taking the tickets.

01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:06.940
So we just walked in there. We could have like, I don't know, probably gone and seen another movie or, I'm sure that's what you call them.

01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:11.940
Gotten chauffeur. Yeah, thanks James or Jeeves or whatever.

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:15.940
So I don't know, we could probably have sold the tickets, I don't know.

01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:27.940
You can't use it for a new movie, but any movie that's already out.

01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:35.940
But it's a 2, or a 1 car.

01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:42.940
Anyway, moving right along, do we want to get in the cage match or does anybody else have something they want to say?

01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:47.940
Do you not have a song still? Because your song is first, buddy.

01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:51.940
No, I don't have anything yet.

01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:54.940
I thought you had the vinyl you wanted to do.

01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:57.940
I did?

01:17:57.940 --> 01:17:59.940
Oh, yeah.

01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:00.940
You gonna do that?

01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:01.940
Yeah, I'll do that.

01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:02.940
All right.

01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:04.940
You have first, bud, so get that vinyl out.

01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:06.940
Sounds a lot crazier than...

01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:08.940
You know what they have in Ragnarok?

01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:09.940
What do they have in Ragnarok?

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:10.940
The two hats.

01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:11.940
Yeah.

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:15.840

01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:02.600
pick from the matrix reloaded soundtrack Mona Lisa overdrive one they all know

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:08.480
how it goes once again so here it is one last time a little piece of it Mona Lisa

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:13.240

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:18.040
retired it we're like TRL up in this shit so here's a little clip of Mona Lisa

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:22.240
overdrive and it's retirement

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:28.080
I'm gonna skip her out sorry

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:44.080
That's it. It's gone. So, all right. That was Mona Lisa Overdrive and it's out. So,

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:49.480
all three of us have brand new picks this week because Mona Lisa Overdrive may no longer

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:56.120
participate. Do you need a little more time, Loki? Because I have some late FUs I can read.

01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:58.120
He needs a little more time, so I'm gonna read some late FUs.

01:19:58.120 --> 01:19:59.120
Oh, you're good?

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:01.120
Well, I need to do these anyways. I'm gonna read some late FUs.

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:05.120
So, late FUs. Shame on you for being late.

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:09.120
Alright, I have way too much fun with those sound clips.

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:12.120
Okay, um, late FUs.

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:16.120
From Nintz, FU to my connection, because I didn't get to hear my first FU.

01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:17.120
What?

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.120
Because I take my socks off a little.

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:21.120
A lot.

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:22.120
Anyway.

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:36.960
I have to go through a proxy server to access the chatroom.

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:38.720
ISPs are dumb that block sites.

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:40.880
F you to not having broadband.

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:44.440
I'm actually sad now that I'm leaving high school so F you to heading out to real life.

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:47.720
It's been great hanging out with all you great people but now we're going to go our separate

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:48.720
way.

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:49.720
Aww.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:55.720
F you to the people at the LAN party yesterday who just wanted to play the fastest map possible on Starcraft.

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:59.720
You're dumb. Stop using noobs maps and try to beat me because you don't know how to play a strategy game.

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:03.720
And F you to them at Counter Strike. Just using the AWP shows you have no skill.

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:07.720
Girls, please, I'm begging you, will you please stop ignoring me when I talk to you, please?

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:10.720
Don't talk to me when I'm doing F you. I'm done now.

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:11.720
Give me a tool case.

01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:12.720
You want a tool case?

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.720
Or a sleeve or something.

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:16.720
Like a big one or a little one?

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:17.720
Little one.

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.720
I don't know where one is. Over here, you guys.

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:21.720
How about here?

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:28.720
Alright. So, back to the cage match.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:32.720
I love that sound effect. Alright.

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:42.720
This week in the Orange Launch Cage Match, now that Mona Lisa Overdrive has been retired, Loki's up first. Loki, tell us about your pick! This should be great.

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:50.680
This is from our girlfriend because she loves Donna Summers and it's the song, I'd say that

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:57.560
Donna Summers is like, well obviously she'd be like the erotic, like the 70's and stuff,

01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:58.560
70's age.

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:00.960
Anyways, this song is Love to Love You Baby.

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:05.340
I believe it's been featured in a few movies and stuff.

01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:08.840
It's also not one of my stronger picks because you know, I gotta give the other people some

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:15.880
chance you know so here we go love to love you baby all right here it is love

01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:17.880
Love you, baby

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:47.880
You're breathing with me

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.880
Yeah, oh

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:53.880
I love you like a baby

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:58.880
I love you like a baby

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:03.880
I love you like a baby

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:05.880
Do it to me again and again

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.880
You put me in sunshine

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:09.880
I put skin in my skin

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:11.880
Oh

01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:14.680
Oh, I'd love to love you, baby

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:18.600
I'd love to love you, baby

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:23.800
Oh, I'd love to love you, baby

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:29.320
Oh, I'd love to love you, baby

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:34.120
Oh, I'd love to love you, baby

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:38.600
Oh, oh I'd love to love you, baby

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:43.600
70 baby, 80 baby, 90 baby given that whole life

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:49.600
90 baby, 100 baby baby, 100 baby baby baby

01:25:49.600 --> 01:26:08.620
Yay!

01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:38.340
I like Donna Summer, she did a good version of MacArthur Park, which was later parodied

01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:49.100
into Jurassic Park, and she did Bad Girls, remember, she did Bad Girls?

01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:50.100
Second Mix.

01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:51.100
Yup.

01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:54.860
Well, her version wasn't in Second Mix, but she did Bad Girls.

01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:55.860
But anyway.

01:26:55.860 --> 01:27:00.780
But that song, you can't disco to it, okay, it's only, and it's too slow to get like a

01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:07.780
good, you know, you know, set music, hello, did you not notice the moaning in the background?

01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:11.780
But that would not be any good for sex either. It's too slow.

01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:16.780
It's good for anal music. Studio 54 music, eh? Right?

01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:19.780
Cause back then that's what they listened to in their effects, right?

01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:23.780
Okay, the only thing that would make that good for like...

01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:27.780
Like even... What were you saying it was good for? Anal?

01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:28.780
Yeah.

01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:30.780
If the person was constipated.

01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:32.780
Okay.

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:35.780
On a station one to... On a station. On a scale of one to ten?

01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:42.780
Three. Just because it gets a little bit of good because Donna Summer has a very nice voice.

01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:43.780
Yes she does.

01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:45.780
But her moaning needs to go.

01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:48.780
Uh, Lanky style. Your thoughts?

01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:51.780
Oh, I'm here.

01:27:51.780 --> 01:28:02.780
My rating for it probably has like a song. I give it, you know, for what it does in its genre. I think it's pretty good. It's eight.

01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:07.780
But for being on our station, I give it a 2. It should not be on Orange Lounge.

01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:09.780
Poo!

01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:10.780
Alright.

01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:11.780
Poo that.

01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:13.780
Rice Princess.

01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:19.780
This song sucks. It was way boring.

01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:21.780
Loki!

01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:23.780
What did you do to my chair?

01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:24.780
It's like all breaking.

01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:28.780
Anyways...

01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:35.780
Um, I give it an 8, because it's the best damn sex music that's on this record.

01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:41.780
And, uh, you have to understand, it's sex making out music, it's not meant to be dancing.

01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:43.780
You don't dance while you're supposed to be having sex.

01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:46.780
That's just like wanting to watch TV instead of having sex.

01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:51.780
Well, that's different, okay? That had more of an upbeat to it, okay?

01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:55.780
And they knew that they were there to dance and fuck. I mean, it's like Studio 54.

01:28:55.780 --> 01:29:07.020
before. I have two words for that song. It's not a word, it's a sound clip. I'd rather

01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:12.260
listen to the Dance Dance Fuck music than that. No, it was okay. That's what my next

01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:18.900
week's cage match pick is going to be. The moaning was cool, I'll give it that, but otherwise

01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:23.400
I'm glad that I no longer have the crappiest cage match pick in Orange Lounge history,

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.400
So thank you for that.

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:28.480
So for that I give you, I won't give you a one, I'll give you a two.

01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:32.680
I didn't even try to find bad, if you want me to find bad, oh man, that's alright, that's

01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:33.680
alright.

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:36.360
Alright, speaking of my pick, let's get to my pick for this week.

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:42.120
This is a little trancy song, this is an artist that was suggested to me on the Sacromani

01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:47.620
boards, so thank you for the suggestion, I like this song, I like this artist, and hopefully

01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:48.620
all you do too.

01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:54.820
This is this is my cage match picks of the pick of the week. This is know me with you. Enjoy

01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:25.620
I lay my hand on you, you

01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:34.620
If I never understand my jealousy Don't cover your eyes and the color inside your heart

01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:40.620
If I ever say to you without calling me

01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:48.620
I'm gonna search up for what I've got reasons to live apart

01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:54.620
You, nothing but you

01:31:54.620 --> 01:32:02.620
The reason for living, I lay my love on you

01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:08.420
You, nothing but you

01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:11.620
But come to me

01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:15.620
I lay my hand on you

01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:19.620
You

01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:30.620
Nothing but you, they're even for living I lay my love on you, you

01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:33.620
Nothing but you

01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:37.620
The calling you've been

01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:41.620
I lay my hand on you

01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:43.620
You

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:50.660
All right that was

01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:53.760
My pick for the case match this week that was know me with you

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:56.880
And I don't think anyone in here was listening, but I listen let's see anyway

01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:01.760
It was boring Jamie would you thought it was boring because I need to sleep it gets so it's pretty

01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:09.440
So it gets like a seven, but it made me sleepy. I made you sleepy all right anyone else want to comment on know me you

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:14.440
Eh. Eh, three. It was kind of boring.

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:19.440
Place some good stuff on there.

01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:21.440
Alright, Brad.

01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:26.440
What are you talking about playing good stuff? Orange Lounge means crap.

01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:29.440
Crap radio, crap music. Thanks for listening, everybody.

01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:34.440
Um, doing alright. This is mediocre. I'd say seven.

01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:44.440
It was okay. It started off good for like 5 seconds. Damn, my poster is all fucked up!

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:52.440
So then, yeah, it was alright. It was like, I don't know, 5 I guess.

01:34:52.440 --> 01:35:00.440
I was just gonna say, they're lucky that I played the Donna Summer song because Rob was suggesting that I play Party All Time by Eddie Murphy.

01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:04.440
Eddie Murphy, so I'd be glad. I have plenty of other really shitty records that I could have played.

01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:13.440
My song was fabulous, as it always is, and it'll be the sleeper hit of Orange Lounge 2003 gets a 10.

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:15.440
Next!

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:19.440
Alright, next. Jamie, would you be kind enough to intro your pick for us?

01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:22.440
Fantastic Plastic Machine would take me to the disco.

01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:24.440
And what else did they do?

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:29.440
They did Beautiful Days and BeatMania CDX. Buy their album, it's called Beautiful, it's released in the US.

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:33.600

and enjoy

01:36:50.760 --> 01:37:05.760
Dancing on the disco at the end of the world

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:13.760
Dancing on the disco at the end of the world

01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:20.760
Dancing down the stairs, go have the info, go on

01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:25.760

01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:17.260
Take me to the disco, take me to the disco

01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:20.760
Dancing at the disco at the end of the world

01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:30.260
Alright, a fantastic plastic machine with disco at the end of the world.

01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:32.260
Let's hear what folks thought.

01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:36.760
I'll have to bring you a copy of the original, um, Take Me to the Disco.

01:40:37.260 --> 01:40:40.260
Just because it's like, you'll hear what parts they took to make that.

01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:45.260
It's like a weird remix of the song, which, for me, I think this is kind of neat to play Ragnarok to that music.

01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:50.260
So, I give it an 8 myself, just because it's one of my neat little things I listen to when I'm bored.

01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:53.260
Alrighty. Mike, you sound?

01:40:53.260 --> 01:41:02.260
Um, hard to say. Maybe it's just a little too repetitive for me, so I'd have to probably give it, like, a 6.

01:41:02.260 --> 01:41:09.260
And also, you know, Beautiful Days is so much better than that song. I guess I've been jaded by that song.

01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:11.260
Bryce Princess.

01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:17.260
It was way better than the crap that you played the last two songs, so I give it a 7.

01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:19.260
Alright, Loki.

01:41:19.260 --> 01:41:21.260
Eh.

01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:24.260
And on a scale of 1 to 10.

01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:26.260
Eh.

01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:32.260
Alright, um, I found myself bopping my head to it a little bit, kind of like a Night at the Rock's Berry type thing, so that was pretty cool.

01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:36.260
I agree it did get maybe a little bit repetitive, but not too bad.

01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:41.260
I don't know. I could put up with it. I could put up for maybe three minutes of it, just not four.

01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:47.260
But it was still pretty cool, so I give it a... I give it an eight. Why not?

01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:56.260
Okay, so let's run through the three songs you can vote for one more time, and then you can send your votes in over private message to Skye in the chat room.

01:41:56.260 --> 01:42:03.260
Here they are. You can vote for Donna Summer with... What the hell was that called?

01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:10.260
I'd love to love you, baby. Play a little clip for me. Just drop it in the middle and it starts.

01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:16.260
Here we go. Oh yeah.

01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:23.260
Alright, that's Donna Summer with Love to Love You Baby. Or you can vote for Nomi with You.

01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:34.580
or you can vote for a fantastic plastic machine with disco at the end of the world

01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:48.740
alright so there they are send in your votes now

01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:52.580
the voting is open now so send those votes to Skye in the chat room

01:42:52.580 --> 01:43:00.580
Write in candidates for a song that was not played as one of those three will be thrown out and you cannot vote again and we will taunt you and make fun of you openly on the show.

01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:03.580
And then we'll find you and start drawing on you.

01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:06.580
We will wiggle our private parts in your general direction.

01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:10.580
Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries.

01:43:10.580 --> 01:43:15.580
And don't threaten to not vote for anything because we've already gotten one vote so we have a winner either way.

01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:19.580
So if it comes down to one vote then I guess it'll be a one vote win.

01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:26.580
Fine by me. Because we're evil dictators, and we always get our way.

01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:29.580
Either evil dictators or just evil dicks, I don't know.

01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:31.580
That's right.

01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:33.580
Okay, so...

01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:36.580
Rob, by the way, you need to get rid of the Furby, okay?

01:43:36.580 --> 01:43:38.580
The Furby? I love my Furby!

01:43:38.580 --> 01:43:40.580
You need to put the Furby in the back.

01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:43.580
My Furby's cool.

01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:46.580
Yes! Give me!

01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:48.580
Oh no.

01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:50.580
Now the ferret's coming.

01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:52.580
It was the coyote.

01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:54.580
The coyote?

01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:56.580
Yeah, it's like the desert dog.

01:43:56.580 --> 01:43:58.580
It's the ferret coyote.

01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:00.580
Very interesting.

01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:11.580
I have to stop drinking now because I have to run to the store after the show's over.

01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:13.580
Aww.

01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:20.580
I know, I've only had one, I've only had half a bottle, but I need to stop, I need to let my system process it, so.

01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:22.580
Hey, let's, let's do listless.

01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:26.580
Let's do listless? We can't, um, we gotta find paper and pencil, which I don't know.

01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:28.580
So let's do a quick break while we find paper and pencil.

01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:31.580
We gotta, we just braked with a bunch of music, so I feel like we've gotta talk about something.

01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:32.580
I'll find paper!

01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:34.580
We gotta talk about something.

01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:36.580
Where?

01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:39.580
Where all the printer paper is in the box, there's printer paper.

01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:40.580
Oh!

01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:41.580
Yay!

01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:55.420
I have something I do want to talk about because I haven't been to Scandia yet since they've

01:44:55.420 --> 01:45:01.160
done this, but apparently, and I never knew this about 2DX machines, but, and I wish Brad

01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:04.480
was here to hear it, but he's not, that's fine.

01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:08.440
The thing about 2DX machines, I guess, is that they have like an S video output and

01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:10.360
a VGA output.

01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:13.360
And for the longest time at Scandi in Sacramento, where

01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:16.400
Orange Lounge is headquartered in Sacramento, they've been

01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:18.320
using S-Video, and it's been kind of blurry.

01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:19.240
I mean, it's been playable.

01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:21.200
It's been very playable, but a little bit blurry.

01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:23.120
You don't get quite that crystal clearness that you get

01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:24.960
when you play it at home.

01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:27.480
But now they've switched over to VGA, and I guess a lot of

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:29.000
people really like the differences.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.080
So I haven't seen the differences myself, but what

01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:33.920
do you guys think of it, like the difference

01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:35.240
between S-Video and VGA?

01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:37.720
It's nice to be able to see everything, like all the

01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:41.440
options you picked and stuff like that you know like light 770 and stuff like

01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:47.800
that it's a bit bright for me I don't know maybe I'm just I thought maybe it

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:51.240
was darker before but it was just a little bit brighter for me but otherwise

01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:55.720
you know it's kind of the same for me I guess I don't really notice that kind of

01:45:55.720 --> 01:46:00.280
stuff you know too much so it makes no difference when you're playing at higher

01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:04.080
speed you can see your keys a lot clearly um the color needs a little bit

01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:09.080
It's not as bad as, say, like, AI's machine was before, you know, with the discoloration.

01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:17.080
It's just slightly off, like, the contrast needs to be adjusted, but since the menus are all in Japanese, it might be a little bit hard to read.

01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:19.080
They changed over, yeah.

01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:22.080
Am I the only person who notices that it looks better?

01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:24.080
Yeah, I've noticed it better.

01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:26.080
Okay, I just, all I've...

01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:32.080
I'm sorry, I just came out of the bathroom, so I missed something, but it looks like everybody I've seen so far has said that it looks like crap.

01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:35.800
it's been like really discolored and stuff you know I think before it was

01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:40.200
discolored now it looks clear I can play almost anything on high-speed 3 with

01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:44.800
like no problem except of course like stocks are at max 300 and stuff I mean

01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:49.000
it looks way better I don't know I miss I'm weird even on a high speed it looks

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.240
great

01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:56.920
played lab during the last break yeah we already heard about the labs good so

01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:00.920
Play it again.

01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:02.920
No.

01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:06.920
Although the act from night is pretty much just lab.

01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:10.920
It's got like a kind of a, well not a similar video.

01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:12.920
It's like an anime girl like running.

01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:14.920
Like a CG anime-ish girl.

01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:16.920
It's pretty cool.

01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:18.920
Hey I've already had to throw out two votes for cage match.

01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:20.920
Pretty cool huh?

01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:21.920
Any reason why?

01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:23.920
Yes, they both voted for Rob's voice to game.

01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:27.920
There's such a retard.

01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:30.920
Oh, was that my outside world talking? I'm sorry.

01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:33.920
You know we have some listeners who are some real retards.

01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:37.920
We love you.

01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:39.920
We love you, but you lose.

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:40.920
Rules are rules.

01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:43.920
Exactly, we love you like our retarded children.

01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:46.920
You know, we have to love you.

01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:48.920
The state says we have to.

01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:50.920
You keep it in the attic?

01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:53.760
They're the special ones we keep in the attic.

01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:54.800
Or the basement.

01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:57.600
But we take them out of the basement when it rains.

01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:01.080
Because, you know, if they get sick, then we have to sort of take them to the doctor and...

01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:04.640
Oh, but when they say something! Oh.

01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:08.560
I think the CDs are cool because you can see the spindles in them.

01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:11.300
All distorted-y. Anyway.

01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:14.320
Ah, retarded kids are already broke, so I mean, we'll...

01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:19.800
We don't really take them anywhere. You can't really tell the difference, you know?

01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:29.800
Especially if you have, like, any blows to the head or anything, you know, and, you know, think that they might give you damage and you're shook, then you forgot, and you're like, oh, that's right, that was like that before you got hit in the head.

01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:32.800
Now the chat room's getting defensive.

01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:39.800
Since when did you guys start taking things we say seriously? Seriously, you guys, seriously. Don't take things seriously.

01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:46.800
Look at the cow, look at the cow, it says bark, bark, bark. Woo! It's bark cow!

01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:49.800
I don't know, I think it's the upstairs, uh, I think it's the upstairs neighbors.

01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:52.800
Our neighbors are pissed at us because we're making retarded jokes.

01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:54.800
They didn't like those cage mat pics either.

01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:55.800
Yeah, exactly.

01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:59.800
Okay, well they've been like totally banging on the like ceiling.

01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:05.800
I don't know, like, earlier today it sounded like someone jumped off the couch or whatever and landed on a floor.

01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:07.800
I don't know what they're doing upstairs, but.

01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:09.800
Isn't that like an older lady? Like a 60 year old?

01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:11.800
It's an older lady and her daughter.

01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:12.800
Is she having sex or something?

01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:13.800
No, it's her daughter.

01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:16.800
No, it's a normal lady and her daughter, I think it's their daughter.

01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:18.800
But like, I hear hanging on the walls all the time.

01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:19.800
Really? You ever see they live?

01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:21.800
Yeah, that's awesome.

01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:24.800
Wasn't it the one with the cat? No, that wasn't with the aliens.

01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:26.800
Kinda, yeah.

01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:27.800
All I'm saying is-

01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:29.800
All the cats could see that they were aliens?

01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:30.800
No, no, no.

01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:31.800
What was busy was that?

01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:32.800
No, it wasn't Cat's Eye.

01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:37.800
All I'm saying is they can go suck it because it's before 10 and, you know, yeah.

01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:40.800
Invaders from Mars?

01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:41.800
Mike, please.

01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:42.800
What?

01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:48.800
We were talking about, that was the one with the spheres, they take the energy out of their body.

01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:52.800
I mean, I haven't seen that movie in forever, and I couldn't remember what that movie was, thank you.

01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:58.800
But no, this was a different movie with the mother and her son, and they were, like, fucking...

01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:08.800
The cats could see that they were really alien or demon or something, and then the cats killed them in the movie.

01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:11.800
Oh, Dark Tetsuya had a good idea.

01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:12.800
What?

01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:15.800
It says that the upstairs folks might be playing world-class track meet.

01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:18.800
You remember on the Nintendo?

01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:20.800
No, they're playing Dance Aerobics.

01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:22.800
Woot woot, Dark Tetsuya.

01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:24.800
I think he gets an honorary zing for that.

01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:25.800
That was like a half zing.

01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:28.800
That was a Z.

01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:31.800
He gets a coyote.

01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:34.800
He gets a non-retardant.

01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:37.800
He's our official non-retardant.

01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:40.800
The rest of you are retards, but this is cool.

01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:42.800
Happy Ferret!

01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:46.800
I'm here to chew bubblegum and that's all.

01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:51.800
And I'm all out of bubblegum, so I'm not doing anything. Goodbye.

01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:59.800
God, I will never forget in Nintendo Power when they had that segment on like the kids who were having the slumber party and playing the Power Pad game or whatever.

01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:06.800
They had like the red team and the yellow team and they were playing. Remember it was like this highlight on the Power Pad and kids having fun?

01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:08.800
Sorry, I wasn't a dork.

01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:12.800
Come on, come on, surely somebody remembers that. Surely.

01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:17.800
I remember you telling me about submitting to be in some video game.

01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:18.800
You submitted-

01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:19.800
Shut up.

01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:21.800
You're a dork.

01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:22.800
Dude.

01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:24.800
You're such a dork.

01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:26.800
I wish we could get a power pad.

01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:27.800
I remember Howard and Esther.

01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:28.800
Do you have a power pad, Jamie?

01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:29.800
Yes, I do.

01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:32.800
You need to bring that shit over and we should have a world class track needed.

01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:33.800
No, Rob.

01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:34.800
Rob?

01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:35.800
No.

01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:36.800
No?

01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:37.800
I'll bring over the power glove.

01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:38.800
It's so bad.

01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:41.800
No, I remember Howard and Esther.

01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:46.800
Actually, I'll try to find it. There's an archive that has almost every Howard and Nester comic online.

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:49.800
I remember seeing that somewhere. You pointed it to me before, I think.

01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:50.800
Long ass time ago.

01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:51.800
Long ass time ago.

01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:53.800
But I remember the Mega Man ones.

01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:06.800
I like that Howard and Nester ones, but I want to find somebody who has scans of all the Zelda comics that were in the Nintendo Power,

01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:10.800
because those were cool. And the Metroid ones, and the Star Fox ones, because they were all cool.

01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:13.300
I think I have an archive that has the Zelda ones.

01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:16.300
I still need to download episodes of the Zelda cartoon.

01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:18.300
Well, excuse me, princess!

01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:23.300
I remember, I had, before my computer died, I had the, um, the one where he was invisible.

01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:25.800
When he, like, stands up in the middle of Ganon's chamber and goes,

01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:27.300
Zelda loves me! Zelda loves me!

01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:28.800
And then they all get shot at.

01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:34.300
Yay! Quiet!

01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:36.800
Sorry, we're gossiping.

01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:39.800
Well, stop gossiping, dammit!

01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:41.800
It's all about you too, bitch

01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:49.720
What yeah this yeah, I can I suppose if I have to

01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:52.480
Yeah a little bit

01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:54.400
We need to be loud

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:58.280
Okay, we're gonna take a break and when we come back. We're gonna have listless. I

01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:04.200
Didn't know they had a monkey pox virus. That's funny. Yeah, I was reading about that on AOL

01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:09.320
They showed a picture of a prairie dog on there and the prairie dog like it was like the prairie dog of Satan

01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:11.320
You are Monkey Pox!

01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:13.320
It was making this face, Rob.

01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:15.320
It was like-

01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:17.320
It was like-

01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:19.320
It was like-

01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:21.320
For the second quarter of 2003, yes,

01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:23.320
Monkey Pox will be the official virus

01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:25.320
of Orange Challenge Radio.

01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:27.320
Is it replacing SARS?

01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:29.320
Yes it is.

01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:31.320
So now Rob,

01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:33.320
do you have Monkey Pox?

01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:35.320
Monkey Pox!

01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:37.320
Monkey Pox!

01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:50.560
OK, well then, I guess on that note, why don't we head off to break, and when we come back,

01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:55.240
we will announce this week's cage match winner, so this is your last chance to submit a vote,

01:53:55.240 --> 01:54:02.200
unless you've already been disqualified, and when we come back, more show, and list lists,

01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:05.120
so we're going to take up a chance to prepare our list lists for tonight.

01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:06.580
So we'll be back.

01:54:06.580 --> 01:54:07.580
And on that note...

01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:52.580
Are you ready to dance into the night?

01:54:52.580 --> 01:54:55.580
Letting go of your body was right there

01:54:55.580 --> 01:54:58.580
You should reach on back

01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:00.580
Under the moonlight

01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:07.580
Love what lies, love what is evil, love what's me, I don't know why

01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:13.580
Do and ask them these rules, pull yourself apart is what you need

01:55:13.580 --> 01:55:18.580
Monkey dance, monkey dance, like a star

01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:21.580
Shake your body down, step on the monkey stand

01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:26.580
Let's dance together, hold on to your favorite hand

01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:30.980
Monkey dance, monkey dance, let me share

01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:34.180
Move your booty down, step on the monkey dance

01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:37.180
Look at this kill, this is a resolution

01:57:37.180 --> 01:57:39.180
Cribble, Cribble!

02:01:07.180 --> 02:01:12.180

We are live, and I bet you're all dying to know who won tonight's cage match.

02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:26.180
Yay.

02:01:26.180 --> 02:01:31.180
Well, here it is, kids. Tonight's cage match winner is...

02:01:31.180 --> 02:01:33.180
Drum roll, please.

02:01:33.180 --> 02:01:43.180
It's a fantastic classic machine with disco at the end of the world.

02:01:43.180 --> 02:01:45.180
It makes me want to shake my bootay.

02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:46.180
What?

02:01:46.180 --> 02:01:48.180
It makes me want to shake my bootay.

02:01:48.180 --> 02:01:49.180
Shake your bootay.

02:01:49.180 --> 02:01:50.180
So there it is.

02:01:50.180 --> 02:01:51.180
Thank you for playing.

02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:52.180
Hah!

02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:53.180
No more Matrix!

02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:54.180
Hah!

02:01:54.180 --> 02:02:02.180
I didn't enter the Matrix into the frickin' contest.

02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:04.180
My song would have been gone this week anyways.

02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:06.180
So there.

02:02:06.180 --> 02:02:08.180
I have had a sniff.

02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:10.180
Alright.

02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:14.180
So, um, what we decided to do this segment, Brad went out to go run an errand.

02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:17.180
So, we're gonna hold off on listless until the next segment.

02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:20.180
But, guess what we have tonight everybody. Are you ready, Irene?

02:02:20.180 --> 02:02:22.180
Okay.

02:02:22.180 --> 02:02:24.180
Lowkey, you're gonna have to be the timer since there's nobody else here.

02:02:24.180 --> 02:02:26.180
So, you ready for this too?

02:02:26.180 --> 02:02:28.180
You have to be a timer. Can you time 30 seconds?

02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:30.180
Uh, I think I can.

02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:35.180
Alright, good. Alright, hold on. I have to queue up the music here.

02:02:35.180 --> 02:02:40.180
Hold on. Sorry.

02:02:40.180 --> 02:02:45.180
I'm having a little problem finding the music. You know what? I need to put all the theme songs

02:02:45.180 --> 02:02:50.180
like in a separate folder. Because my drive, if you haven't already

02:02:50.180 --> 02:02:55.180
figured it out, is very dirty.

02:02:55.180 --> 02:03:22.180

02:05:44.140 --> 02:05:49.140
Ireland and 27.

02:05:49.140 --> 02:05:51.140
Okay, what is her mother's occupation?

02:05:51.140 --> 02:05:52.140
No, she was born in Australia.

02:05:52.140 --> 02:05:56.140
What is her mother's occupation?

02:05:56.140 --> 02:05:59.140
What is the name of her acid jazz band?

02:05:59.140 --> 02:06:00.140
I don't know.

02:06:00.140 --> 02:06:03.140
What is her alter ego's name?

02:06:03.140 --> 02:06:04.140
Donna Summer.

02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:07.140
Okay, where did she live until she was 16?

02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:08.140
Australia.

02:06:08.140 --> 02:06:12.140
Okay, is that it?

02:06:12.140 --> 02:06:14.140
Okay.

02:06:14.140 --> 02:06:19.140
Since your first answer was incorrect, that one doesn't count, the first question.

02:06:19.140 --> 02:06:20.140
Oh, come on.

02:06:20.140 --> 02:06:24.140
And it's a two-part question, which means it counts for one point, so you get a half point.

02:06:24.140 --> 02:06:25.140
Oh, goodie.

02:06:25.140 --> 02:06:26.140
What was that?

02:06:26.140 --> 02:06:27.140
Okay.

02:06:27.140 --> 02:06:28.140
Um.

02:06:28.140 --> 02:06:29.140
Do we have to get Jamie in here too or?

02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:30.140
Yeah, Jamie can come out.

02:06:30.140 --> 02:06:31.140
Okay.

02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:32.140
So you got a half a point.

02:06:32.140 --> 02:06:34.420
Wait, I got a half point overall?

02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:35.420
Yeah.

02:06:35.420 --> 02:06:36.420
That sucks!

02:06:36.420 --> 02:06:37.420
Yeah.

02:06:37.420 --> 02:06:38.420
I don't like this game.

02:06:38.420 --> 02:06:39.420
Wah.

02:06:39.420 --> 02:06:40.420
I don't like games where Jamie beats me.

02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:41.420
You're the only one.

02:06:41.420 --> 02:06:43.420
You're the only one that doesn't like it.

02:06:43.420 --> 02:06:46.740
You're like, Jamie, it's time to come out now.

02:06:46.740 --> 02:06:48.820
Okay, is she up?

02:06:48.820 --> 02:06:51.260
No, I think she's, you know.

02:06:51.260 --> 02:06:52.260
Uh oh.

02:06:52.260 --> 02:06:56.260
okay should I just

02:06:56.260 --> 02:06:59.740
I don't know sure why not okay

02:06:59.740 --> 02:07:04.060
well first question how old is she and where was she born she's 27 years old

02:07:04.060 --> 02:07:07.380
oh wow and she was born in Australia but you said

02:07:07.380 --> 02:07:10.460
Come on! You said Ireland or something first. I changed it.

02:07:10.460 --> 02:07:14.340
Wham! Come on! My clit hurts. Is that the one she...

02:07:14.340 --> 02:07:17.460
Fine I'll make it one you're still fine. Is that the one she got right?

02:07:17.460 --> 02:07:21.380
No. Okay did you hear that Jamie? I threw a fit

02:07:21.380 --> 02:07:24.860
Because I said Ireland at first for the first question, then I'm like, no, wait, Australia.

02:07:24.860 --> 02:07:26.460
So I made I made her give it to me.

02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:32.660
Okay. I know I was, he got one point anyway, and you got one point.

02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:33.780
So you guys are tied anyway.

02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:35.060
He would have gotten a half point.

02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:36.420
Because I guess whatever.

02:07:36.700 --> 02:07:37.620
I guess 27.

02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:39.500
Anyway, yeah, so she's 27 years old.

02:07:39.500 --> 02:07:40.940
And she's born in Australia.

02:07:41.260 --> 02:07:45.060
Her mother is an opera singer, a famous opera singer at that.

02:07:45.340 --> 02:07:47.140
Okay, and the acid jazz band.

02:07:47.140 --> 02:07:52.240
she's a part of it's called cracker jam because she's white I guess her alter

02:07:52.240 --> 02:08:01.940
egos naoki right close but no it's Sonia that's her alter egos name and she lived

02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:10.540
oh god she lived in France until she was 16 I wonder she's just stupid oh god

02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:14.860
yeah and other interesting fact she's married but she tells everyone she thought

02:08:14.860 --> 02:08:21.860
Yeah, and she lives in Japan. Wow, that's it. That concludes another segment of Orange Crush.

02:08:25.860 --> 02:08:29.860
Hold on, I have to get back to the computer so I can officially close out this segment.

02:08:34.860 --> 02:08:35.860
That's like shitty Radio Rob.

02:08:35.860 --> 02:08:50.860
That's the end of Orange Crush, Polteri really sucked on Orange Crush. One point for Rob, I don't care. Australia was the answer, not that country with red hair. Okay.

02:08:50.860 --> 02:08:53.860
Okay.

02:08:53.860 --> 02:08:54.860
I said Italy.

02:08:54.860 --> 02:09:00.860
You said Italy?

02:09:00.860 --> 02:09:06.860
I technically got one right because I said not polytary for her alter-ego.

02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:07.860
Ah, true.

02:09:07.860 --> 02:09:08.860
Aha!

02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:09.860
Whatever.

02:09:09.860 --> 02:09:13.780
So if you can get Australia, then I get not polytary.

02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:14.780
You know what's your prize?

02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:17.460
You get to listen to polytary music all night long.

02:09:17.460 --> 02:09:18.460
You know what you can do?

02:09:18.460 --> 02:09:19.460
Ah!

02:09:19.460 --> 02:09:20.460
You know what you can do?

02:09:20.460 --> 02:09:21.460
What?

02:09:21.460 --> 02:09:22.460
Pick a key, please.

02:09:22.460 --> 02:09:23.460
Pick a...

02:09:23.460 --> 02:09:24.460
And stay in it.

02:09:24.460 --> 02:09:39.460
So, did we learn something from tonight's Orange Crush segment?

02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:44.900
It's actually kind of neat because now we know who to hold for ransom if we ever want

02:09:44.900 --> 02:09:47.460
to have Paul Terry never sing again.

02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:48.460
Excellent.

02:09:48.460 --> 02:09:51.620
Thank you Irene, that was cool.

02:09:51.620 --> 02:09:53.780
I love the Orange Crush segment, Irene.

02:09:53.780 --> 02:09:55.780
How do you do your research for that?

02:09:55.780 --> 02:09:56.780
So that we know where to look.

02:09:56.780 --> 02:09:59.780
On a mic. On a mic. On a mic.

02:10:02.780 --> 02:10:04.780
Quiet! Wow!

02:10:05.780 --> 02:10:07.780
It's so, so quiet.

02:10:10.780 --> 02:10:13.780
You know what? I got my Bjork tickets today and I have to sell them.

02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:14.780
Why?

02:10:14.780 --> 02:10:16.780
Because I'm going to go to Cyberbeat Nation too.

02:10:16.780 --> 02:10:18.780
I want to go.

02:10:18.780 --> 02:10:19.780
Where's she playing?

02:10:19.780 --> 02:10:20.780
You want to go to Bjork?

02:10:20.780 --> 02:10:21.780
Yeah.

02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:27.780
I can't afford to pay me kickbacks on the tickets because I'm probably going to have to get the cost 100 bucks for two.

02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:32.780
Yeah, it's a lot. So, I'm probably going to put them on eBay if none of my friends take them.

02:10:32.780 --> 02:10:35.780
Just because I need to make my money back so I have money to spend in L.A.

02:10:35.780 --> 02:10:36.780
When's the concert?

02:10:36.780 --> 02:10:37.780
It is August 8th.

02:10:37.780 --> 02:10:38.780
Where?

02:10:38.780 --> 02:10:41.780
And at Pier 3032 in San Francisco.

02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:43.780
I can't go to that anyway.

02:10:43.780 --> 02:10:44.780
Classic Gaming Expo?

02:10:44.780 --> 02:10:47.780
Oh, that's right. Yep, you're going to be at the Classic Gaming Expo.

02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:48.780
Did you already register for that?

02:10:48.780 --> 02:10:49.780
No.

02:10:49.780 --> 02:10:50.780
Oh.

02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:51.780
You're just going to show up at the door and go,

02:10:51.780 --> 02:10:52.780
Hey!

02:10:52.780 --> 02:10:53.780
Um, I'll talk to Xander.

02:10:53.780 --> 02:10:54.780
Hey!

02:10:54.780 --> 02:10:57.780
I'll talk to Xander about it, because I can't get a fan of me.

02:10:57.780 --> 02:11:00.780
I can't get a fan of me.

02:11:00.780 --> 02:11:01.780
Like, I don't care.

02:11:01.780 --> 02:11:02.780
No.

02:11:02.780 --> 02:11:06.780
Well, it's just because, you know, what's the point of going if I can't cosplay, so.

02:11:06.780 --> 02:11:10.780
Um, what else was I going to say?

02:11:10.780 --> 02:11:11.780
I don't remember.

02:11:11.780 --> 02:11:16.780
Um, upcoming, yeah, Cyberbeat Nation 2, there's this little teaser.

02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:17.780
They've been teasing it online.

02:11:17.780 --> 02:11:19.780
They have a little teaser trailer.

02:11:19.780 --> 02:11:22.780
Excuse me, it's out. And it's pretty cool.

02:11:22.780 --> 02:11:28.780
They hint at that there's going to be perfect attacks, singles and doubles this time around. That should be interesting.

02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:35.780
And freestyle, if I read this teaser correctly, they're saying any Bamani song you want.

02:11:35.780 --> 02:11:42.780
Which makes me think they're going to do freestyle on a sim. That's just a guess, though. But that's the only way you could do it, right?

02:11:42.780 --> 02:11:44.780
It'll never happen.

02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:46.780
Why is that?

02:11:46.780 --> 02:11:50.780
Because they're too dumb to find actual sim files, they're synced up correctly and then you'll have people go,

02:11:50.780 --> 02:11:52.780
What is that thing?

02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:55.780
Watch as you get an email in a couple of weeks.

02:11:55.780 --> 02:11:58.780
Well, yeah, you're going to get an email. Hello, key help.

02:11:58.780 --> 02:12:03.780
But actually, what if people were responsible for making their own sim files and bringing them in?

02:12:03.780 --> 02:12:04.780
That's what I would have meant.

02:12:04.780 --> 02:12:08.780
Oh my, that'll happen. That'll be awful.

02:12:08.780 --> 02:12:13.780
If they're giving away another arcade machine, you can bet people will go to the distance to make it happen.

02:12:13.780 --> 02:12:15.100
I think it could be successful.

02:12:15.100 --> 02:12:18.980
Hell, at Shaft we ended up using a sim.

02:12:18.980 --> 02:12:22.380
Because I'm cool and I'm the only one that can pull it off.

02:12:22.380 --> 02:12:26.940
Only one anywhere that can pull it off.

02:12:26.940 --> 02:12:29.900
No one will be able to do it except for me.

02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:33.700
Me, me, me, me, me.

02:12:33.700 --> 02:12:36.180
Oh, really now?

02:12:36.180 --> 02:12:38.540
OK.

02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:48.500
Segue into the Sims section. Okay, stuff that's going on. First off, you've got a

02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:52.740
couple sites, you know, going through redesigns, you have Maniacs that's updating the site

02:12:52.740 --> 02:12:57.840
and it looks pretty. You've got Turning Mix 4, which is ending their submissions

02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:02.180
in four days, so if you have, if you've registered already, which you must have

02:13:02.180 --> 02:13:06.660
if you're joining up, have your file done in four days, because I needed to get my

02:13:06.660 --> 02:13:12.440
file then four days is not yet also there's rumored to be about 400 entries

02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:16.400
they've got about 10 judges so it looks pretty cool they're gonna be doing them

02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:22.200
like I believe release releasing a group of files every week and then voting on

02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:28.620
those and then new set will come up and so on and so forth other than that we've

02:13:28.620 --> 02:13:35.960
got let's see a few fun sim files came out like a terrible mr. Grimshaw good

02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:43.620
check that one out for Monty Sims and really oh one more interesting bit of

02:13:43.620 --> 02:13:47.300
information is not really sim related but it was on a sim site that I found it

02:13:47.300 --> 02:13:54.180
DDR UK there's this guy who goes by the name Havok on there and he like I just

02:13:54.180 --> 02:13:58.380
like me he has copies of their arcade disc but since you know you've got the

02:13:58.380 --> 02:14:03.860
UK arcade disc he's got a dancing stage Euromix 2 disc and what's funny is he

02:14:03.860 --> 02:14:08.960
He found some songs on the disc that weren't in the actual game itself.

02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:13.040
And one of those songs would be from NSYNC, Bye Bye Bye.

02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:18.860
And this is an official Konami song that was supposed to be in EuroMix 2, but never made

02:14:18.860 --> 02:14:24.880
it in, or it's an unlock that, you know, obviously, because the EuroMix 2 site was never finished,

02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:29.560
so you know, maybe they just never got around to releasing unlock codes for it, but he says

02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:31.840
that's not the only song that's hidden in there too.

02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:37.640
there's actually more than one song so I mean we're gonna find out in a few

02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:41.040
weeks here that there's gonna be more and more songs and rumor that these

02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:44.960
songs you know for some reason didn't appear in your mix too they might be in

02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:49.200
your own x3 or the fact the license you might have been cut on them it's hard to

02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:53.020
say but that is an official song that was supposed to be in your mix to bye

02:14:53.020 --> 02:14:54.020
Bye bye bye.

02:14:54.020 --> 02:14:55.020
So.

02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:56.020
Yeah.

02:14:56.020 --> 02:14:57.020
Rob.

02:14:57.020 --> 02:14:58.020
And Lisa.

02:14:58.020 --> 02:15:17.180
See, I have to listen to people play the light FM.

02:15:17.180 --> 02:15:20.080
See, I thought I got away from it when I lost my job.

02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:23.080
But no, people played around me all the time now.

02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:24.080
Guess what though?

02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:25.080
What?

02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:29.080
I get them back by playing, um, I'm gonna make a CD tonight picked to work.

02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:30.080
Uh huh.

02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:31.080
Of Hair Rock.

02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:32.080
Cool.

02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:34.080
Poison Motley Crue, Guns N' Roses.

02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:39.080
Walk this way!

02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:40.080
And Tesla.

02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:42.080
Walk this way!

02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:44.080
And then they have to put up with my tramp.

02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:49.080
And everyone leaves the office when I'm working my overtime, so I turn up my tramp CD.

02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:54.080
What a cool- We can't hear you, Irene.

02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:59.080
I play Orange Lounge all day every day because they let me listen to it and they don't care.

02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:05.080
It's funny because, you know, when you play, like, Highs Off You or, you know, any other song that says, like, bug or shit, you know.

02:16:05.080 --> 02:16:11.080
Like, some will be a fact thing next to me and you'll say that and, la la la la, no one cares. So, yeah.

02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:15.080
You can't even understand it in Highs Off You. You can't understand the I feel in that song.

02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:24.080
This is actually a good segue, because I wanted to go back. You guys weren't paying attention because you were watching the Matrix thing, but Muhimer had a pretty interesting F.U. of the week, so I want to read this again.

02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:26.080
He said...

02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:28.080
Welcome back!

02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:33.080
So, I wanted to go back to Muhimer's Fuck You of the Week. This is interesting. He said, this is a part of it, he says,

02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:41.080
Fuck the six flags near me, because they had to get rid of their four extremes, because some bitch complained about the word bitch in it.

02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:43.080
Really?

02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:45.080
What are you guys thinking about?

02:16:45.080 --> 02:16:46.080
Where?

02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:48.080
BITCH!

02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:51.080
Whoever took that out, you're a bitch.

02:16:51.080 --> 02:16:53.080
Bitches are everywhere, you can't get away from them.

02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:55.080
So just deal with it, okay?

02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:59.080
Just like retarded kids and faggots.

02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:10.080
The official term, or the technical term for them, are window lickers.

02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:24.720
just like to say to that woman wait it's somewhere in here hold on hold on yeah

02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:27.120
there you go what'd you do every time that song played on the radio did you

02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:32.680
call the station and complain and tell them to go off air once again it's stupid

02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:39.080
parents trying to get other people to parent their job for them if your kids

02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:42.080
Oh my god, they heard the word bitch.

02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:45.080
Well, oh my god, turn on the TV.

02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:49.080
Well, you know what people's fascination is with curse words anyway?

02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:51.080
It's the fact that you tell them you can't do it.

02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:55.080
If you don't like the word bitch, become Amish.

02:17:55.080 --> 02:18:01.080
Children would not be as apt to curse if you acted like it was no big thing.

02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:02.080
You know?

02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:08.080
I hope you don't let your kids watch TV because they say bitch on it all the time.

02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:16.080
Everyone should read the first story in The Illustrated Man, which I'm reading right now.

02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:22.080
It talks about parenting and what happens when you don't parent your kids yourself.

02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:25.080
It's really bad, so yeah, you should read it.

02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:29.080
If you have a question as to what song in DDR has bitch in it,

02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:48.520
It says in the background, not an extreme, bitch, no that song is gone, but this is going

02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:53.240
to be interesting because the rumor is, and this is merely rumor at this point, but supposedly

02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:59.920
in that trailer for Max 2 USA, somebody caught a glimpse of the DJ Alligator Project video

02:18:59.920 --> 02:19:03.440
for Blow My Whistle Bitch, which is going to be interesting to see how the USA treats

02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:04.440
that.

02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:08.760
Well, here's the thing, though, is he actually officially had, it wasn't, you know, the fact

02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:10.760
that it was censored, there's two different songs.

02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:14.720
They're the same damn song, but it's Blow My Whistle Bitch and Blow My Whistle Baby,

02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:20.440
or The Whistle Song, see, so that's actually, you know, the official title is, you know,

02:19:20.440 --> 02:19:25.160
the whistle song but you know that's over here you know what I caught them

02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:30.040
both sucks well here's the thing anyways I mean I'm sure they're gonna censor

02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:34.920
because if we have like you know was a gentle stress the AMD sensual mix

02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:41.200
instead of sexual I mean yeah they're stupid but whatever don't care I'm

02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:45.040
getting yelled at because I played the one-two little bitch by bus stop and not

02:19:45.040 --> 02:19:49.080
the specials which is the one that's actually an extreme sorry get over it my

02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:54.080
Actually, if you want to be technical, Little Bitch was in the first DDR.

02:19:54.080 --> 02:20:01.080
Right, and that's why it was brought back for Xtreme, because remember they brought back a bunch of old school DDR songs like Butterfly?

02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:04.080
Oh my god, some guy wanted me to play Butterfly the other day.

02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:05.080
Did you do it?

02:20:05.080 --> 02:20:06.080
No.

02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:07.080
Would you tell him?

02:20:07.080 --> 02:20:13.080
I said, I played that a lot when the game was new.

02:20:13.080 --> 02:20:15.080
And he was like, oh.

02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:18.080
I was playing DDR with someone I've never met before.

02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:28.080
I miss being able to do that, you know? Back in the days when no one knew who the other one was, and we'd all randomly play DDR together, and then we just sort of eventually told each other our names.

02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:32.080
Stop it, Rob. You can stop that right now.

02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:39.080
Hey, let's do, um, List List.

02:20:39.080 --> 02:20:40.080
Oh, we're gonna do List List now?

02:20:40.080 --> 02:20:41.080
Yeah.

02:20:41.080 --> 02:20:44.080
Okay, so we have to take a quick break, and then we're gonna come back and do List List.

02:20:44.080 --> 02:20:46.080
Play, um, the Desiro songs from Papa Music.

02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:50.040
Okay, we're going to play some Desero songs from Poppin' Music, so it's going to be not

02:20:50.040 --> 02:20:51.420
a too long of a break.

02:20:51.420 --> 02:21:00.340
So we have Cobalt from Poppin' Music 9, and we have Pure from Poppin' Music 8.

02:21:00.340 --> 02:21:08.000
And then I'm going to play something from DDR Solo Mix, just for good measure.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:14.000
No, I'm going to play Wonderland from Third Mix, and then we'll come back listless.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
And what is tonight's listless topic?

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:19.000
Best Bemani songs to fuck by.

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Yes, just like our live journal, Best Bemani songs to fuck too.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
We'll be back.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:29.400
Okay y'all, this is it, now pump it, the mic will sing soon as I touch it

02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:32.800
Dude, it's smooth and easy like, so we might get hyped to hear tonight

02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:34.800
She might relax and she's way the back

02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:37.600
If you ain't with that, I'ma have to attack you with a bad rap

02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:40.800
That can smack the smile off your face, that's when it's up, no crap

02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:44.800
Give it a little bit of heart and soul as you do it, till you in your ear hole, huh

02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:46.800
I ain't going out like a sucker

02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:48.800
And if you think so, boy, then puff up

02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:50.880
Off the chips, I'm outta this lyric, it's slow

02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:52.280
And I'm on it, word up, it's through

02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:53.600
It's that you do, move you

02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:55.200
Fightin' people, now it's time to

02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:59.660
Okay, so, back to the show, and back to the listless topic at hand.

02:26:59.660 --> 02:27:02.460
Jamie, what is the listless topic at hand?

02:27:02.460 --> 02:27:04.460
Best of any songs to fuck to.

02:27:04.460 --> 02:27:05.460
Or to hand to.

02:27:05.460 --> 02:27:06.460
No, just kidding.

02:27:06.460 --> 02:27:07.460
To fuck to.

02:27:07.460 --> 02:27:08.460
To fuck.

02:27:08.460 --> 02:27:09.460
This is und.

02:27:09.460 --> 02:27:10.460
The unforific topic.

02:27:10.460 --> 02:27:11.460
Yeah.

02:27:11.460 --> 02:27:12.460
So, are we ready?

02:27:12.460 --> 02:27:13.460
I am.

02:27:13.460 --> 02:27:14.460
Okay.

02:27:14.460 --> 02:27:16.460
Are you going to be okay, Irene?

02:27:16.460 --> 02:27:18.460
Because you said you weren't ready yet.

02:27:18.460 --> 02:27:19.460
You said you weren't ready.

02:27:19.460 --> 02:27:20.460
Okay, all right.

02:27:20.460 --> 02:27:21.460
Who wants to start?

02:27:21.460 --> 02:27:22.460
I will.

02:27:22.460 --> 02:27:25.860
Okay, Jamie numbers. Oh, we haven't done list list in a long time

02:27:25.860 --> 02:27:30.180
I guess I should explain what this is all about or do you want to you want me like we all pick our top threes

02:27:30.300 --> 02:27:33.360
And then we all vote one off and then you vote yes

02:27:33.620 --> 02:27:40.000
So the chat room has the final say so you can vote and this is a scientific proven process

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
This is the top three of all time no disputing

02:27:42.620 --> 02:27:44.620
Okay, so Jamie you're number three

02:27:45.820 --> 02:27:48.180
Okay, my number three is a gravity

02:27:49.260 --> 02:27:50.780
gravity

02:27:50.780 --> 02:27:52.780
Not a Loki remix?

02:27:52.780 --> 02:27:56.780
Well, that's a little bit too angry. That's like the S&M, you know.

02:27:56.780 --> 02:28:00.780
I say Gravity because if you think about it, it's like rhythmically good.

02:28:00.780 --> 02:28:04.780
Brad said Gravity, the anal burnination mix.

02:28:04.780 --> 02:28:07.780
Okay, fine. I'll go next.

02:28:07.780 --> 02:28:13.780
My number three pick, and this would be for like if you're having some fast, dirty, rotten sex, Max 300s.

02:28:13.780 --> 02:28:16.780
Ew.

02:28:16.780 --> 02:28:19.280
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.

02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:20.780
Okay.

02:28:20.780 --> 02:28:23.420
Loke, you're number three pick.

02:28:23.420 --> 02:28:31.780
Um, I was gonna say, probably, we've gotta go with hot limit, because it's a longer song.

02:28:31.780 --> 02:28:35.780
And, uh, ya know, people like things that are longer, so.

02:28:35.780 --> 02:28:37.280
I'm not gonna make a comment.

02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:39.340
It doesn't work.

02:28:39.340 --> 02:28:40.760
It doesn't.

02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:41.760
What?

02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:43.540
It doesn't work.

02:28:43.540 --> 02:28:44.560
Oh, my.

02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:46.560
Oh, my.

02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:50.560
Oh my, as the room slowly gets it. La la la la la.

02:28:50.560 --> 02:28:54.560
Okay.

02:28:54.560 --> 02:28:58.560
Yeah, I know, seriously. Alright, Irene, your turn.

02:28:58.560 --> 02:29:02.560
Um, I picked a serious one.

02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:06.560
Ecstasy, because, I mean, come on now. Like, I need to explain stuff.

02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:10.560
Okay, Brad's turn. Ecstasy. Ecstasy, ugh.

02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:14.560
Alright. Brad, Mr. Lanky Style.

02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:16.560
Wait, did Mac go already?

02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:17.560
He did.

02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:18.560
Okay.

02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:19.560
Everybody beat you.

02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:26.560
I'm going to have to say In the Heat of the Night is my number three.

02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:28.560
In the Heat of the Night.

02:29:28.560 --> 02:29:29.560
Sorry.

02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:30.560
Okay.

02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:31.560
My number two?

02:29:31.560 --> 02:29:32.560
Yes, your number two.

02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:34.560
It's from Solo, Let the Beat Hit Him.

02:29:34.560 --> 02:29:37.560
Let the Beat Hit Him.

02:29:37.560 --> 02:29:38.560
Actually, don't take that back.

02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:41.560
My other version is from Solo, the version from Max 2.

02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:45.560
Okay, so, uh, let the beat hit a R&B style.

02:29:45.560 --> 02:29:46.560
Yeah.

02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:51.560
It's like if you want, you know, the slow groove.

02:29:51.560 --> 02:29:52.560
Nice.

02:29:52.560 --> 02:29:53.560
Uh, my turn.

02:29:53.560 --> 02:29:58.560
My number two pick, um, and this is one that came to me during the break, but honestly,

02:29:58.560 --> 02:29:59.560
think about it.

02:29:59.560 --> 02:30:00.560
This song will be awesome.

02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:01.560
This song will be awesome.

02:30:01.560 --> 02:30:02.560
That's next to it.

02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:03.560
Jem Jem Reggae.

02:30:03.560 --> 02:30:08.560
What the fuck are you smoking, man?

02:30:08.560 --> 02:30:09.560
Instant softy for me.

02:30:09.560 --> 02:30:12.560
I mean, that's not going to do anything.

02:30:12.560 --> 02:30:14.560
I can't spell reggae.

02:30:14.560 --> 02:30:16.560
Yeah, there you go.

02:30:16.560 --> 02:30:18.560
There's validity behind it.

02:30:18.560 --> 02:30:19.560
Just think about it.

02:30:19.560 --> 02:30:22.560
A-E. Oh, my bad.

02:30:22.560 --> 02:30:24.560
There it is.

02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:25.560
Sorry, I'm too white.

02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:27.560
I'm too white to spell.

02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:28.560
Just thinkin'.

02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:29.560
On the make-up.

02:30:29.560 --> 02:30:30.560
Jam, jam, regga-do-go.

02:30:30.560 --> 02:30:31.560
Anyway, come on.

02:30:31.560 --> 02:30:35.560
Shut up.

02:30:35.560 --> 02:30:37.560
Get away from me.

02:30:37.560 --> 02:30:39.560
Irene. Oh, sorry, Loki.

02:30:39.560 --> 02:30:41.560
Yeah.

02:30:41.560 --> 02:30:45.560
Just because it's got the, you know, background to go with it.

02:30:45.560 --> 02:30:47.560
Sexy Planet.

02:30:47.560 --> 02:30:51.560
You took my fucking pick, you bastard!

02:30:51.560 --> 02:30:53.560
Okay, that's fine.

02:30:53.560 --> 02:30:55.560
Okay, so Sexy Planet.

02:30:55.560 --> 02:30:58.560
Irene, your number two pick.

02:30:58.560 --> 02:31:01.560
You took it. I have to go with Love Machine.

02:31:01.560 --> 02:31:02.560
Love Machine.

02:31:02.560 --> 02:31:03.560
Yeah.

02:31:03.560 --> 02:31:05.560
I'm just a love machine. I like that song.

02:31:05.560 --> 02:31:07.560
I have another one, but I...

02:31:08.560 --> 02:31:09.560
Alright.

02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:10.560
Oh, yeah.

02:31:10.560 --> 02:31:12.560
Uh, Mr. Brad, your number two pick, please.

02:31:12.560 --> 02:31:13.560
DXY, baby.

02:31:13.560 --> 02:31:14.560
DXY.

02:31:14.560 --> 02:31:18.560
It's got the perfect flow, and it's got the climax in there, and then the call, you know,

02:31:18.560 --> 02:31:19.560
Oh my.

02:31:19.560 --> 02:31:20.560
Yeah, the cigarette part at the end.

02:31:20.560 --> 02:31:23.560
The flow, the climax, and the cigarette, it's all there.

02:31:23.560 --> 02:31:26.560
Not the flow, like, that kind of flow, you fuckin' sicko.

02:31:26.560 --> 02:31:28.560
I mean, like, the build-up.

02:31:28.560 --> 02:31:32.560
Like, starts off, starts off slow, build up, like, dangerous.

02:31:32.560 --> 02:31:33.560
I'm gonna...

02:31:33.560 --> 02:31:34.560
Yeah.

02:31:34.560 --> 02:31:36.560
Yeah, anyway, jig fly.

02:31:36.560 --> 02:31:38.560
Alright, like what?

02:31:38.560 --> 02:31:42.560
Jamie, your number one pick, best song to oomph to.

02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:47.560
I'm gonna not, I had another one that was the obvious choice, but actually, Sink.

02:31:47.560 --> 02:31:48.560
Sink?

02:31:48.560 --> 02:31:59.560
Because it actually does have, it actually does have the slow build up, the yay, you know, this is fun, and then the dying off the end.

02:31:59.560 --> 02:32:04.560
That's if you're into asphyxiation.

02:32:08.560 --> 02:32:11.560
So...

02:32:11.560 --> 02:32:16.560
Guess what everybody, this is just in. Zero's having an orange lounge party at his house in two weeks.

02:32:16.560 --> 02:32:19.560
Yay! Party! Party!

02:32:19.560 --> 02:32:20.560
Okay, Reed!

02:32:20.560 --> 02:32:21.560
What?

02:32:21.560 --> 02:32:26.560
Um, Zero. Just, uh, thought I'd remind you a little bit.

02:32:26.560 --> 02:32:29.560
Oh, never mind. Continue.

02:32:29.560 --> 02:32:32.560
Wait, you thought two weeks was Fanime or something?

02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:34.560
Or what? I don't know what...

02:32:34.560 --> 02:32:37.560
Exactly what I was thinking.

02:32:37.560 --> 02:32:42.560
Well, sorta is. In two weekends it'll be Fanime, I think.

02:32:42.560 --> 02:32:44.560
Okay, let's keep going with the list list.

02:32:44.560 --> 02:32:46.560
Back to list list, thank you.

02:32:46.560 --> 02:32:48.560
My number one pick would be, of course...

02:32:48.560 --> 02:32:53.560
You know, this is obvious. I'm sorry, I am going with the obvious, because it's true. Do it all night.

02:32:57.560 --> 02:33:01.560
Alright, fine. Well then fine, let's hear your number one obvious pick.

02:33:02.560 --> 02:33:10.560
Okay, mine is going to be Wild Rush, because it starts off slow and it gets faster as it goes along.

02:33:11.560 --> 02:33:14.560
Actually, the Wild Rush remix is pretty hot.

02:33:14.560 --> 02:33:21.560
Alright. Yeah! Rice Princess, your number one pick.

02:33:21.560 --> 02:33:26.560
Um, is no one going to say one of the other obvious songs?

02:33:26.560 --> 02:33:29.560
It's down to you and Brad, so you better figure out.

02:33:29.560 --> 02:33:34.560
Can I give an honorable mention? No, say what? After we're done.

02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:39.560
Okay, my number one's Afronova. Don't ask, I don't know.

02:33:39.560 --> 02:33:44.720
Afrinova. I guess everybody was being nice to me so they can give me the real obvious

02:33:44.720 --> 02:33:53.720
one. Okay. Okay. My number one choice. Trumbo please. Yes. Crash. Please don't. I'm kidding,

02:33:53.720 --> 02:34:01.080
I'm kidding. Thank you. Insertion, duh. Insertion, thank you. Why? Okay, now we're going to the

02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:05.080
honorable mentions. No one said the whistle song. No one said after the game of love.

02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:06.080
Because those suck.

02:34:06.080 --> 02:34:07.080
Temple of love.

02:34:07.080 --> 02:34:09.080
No Greco-Lalman style.

02:34:09.080 --> 02:34:10.080
Thanks.

02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:14.080
Alright, so here is the list.

02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:17.080
Have you never been mellow?

02:34:17.080 --> 02:34:20.080
Here's some of the bullshit lists I had before we go on.

02:34:20.080 --> 02:34:21.080
Dead End.

02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:23.080
Healing Vision Angelic Mix.

02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:24.080
Hypnotic Crisis.

02:34:24.080 --> 02:34:28.080
Paranoid of Dirty Mix, in case you're like, you're uh, paranoid.

02:34:28.080 --> 02:34:31.080
Of, you're jealous and you're, yeah.

02:34:31.080 --> 02:34:33.080
Well, and Crash of course.

02:34:33.080 --> 02:34:36.800
of course I actually wouldn't mind one of the other ones I was gonna say was

02:34:36.800 --> 02:34:42.520
paranoia clean just like the the pounding one or I was gonna say

02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:47.080
hellscaper or maybe crimson hat Center

02:34:48.120 --> 02:34:52.640
anyway some suggestions from the chat room some suggestions from the chat room

02:34:52.640 --> 02:35:01.800
as well gimme gimme gimme let's see I think he is good V Oh Nick please not so

02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:09.800
Boom Boom Dollar, Dubby Dub, So Many Men, It's Raining Men, Test My Best, Cowgirl.

02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:14.800
I've never heard the full version of So Many Men. It's like she's an utter slut.

02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:21.800
Now I would have picked this song had it been in the actual game and not just part of the megamix.

02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:43.440
the MegaMix, the Paranoid Evolution, and of course, shame on all of us for forgetting

02:35:43.440 --> 02:35:46.120
this one, Be In My Paradise.

02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:47.120
Okay, no.

02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:52.120
Being in my paradise, Rob, makes me break out in hives.

02:35:53.120 --> 02:35:54.120
It's really nasty.

02:35:55.120 --> 02:35:56.120
Alright.

02:35:57.120 --> 02:35:58.120
Let's, uh...

02:35:58.120 --> 02:36:01.120
Oh, there's, like, um, right now.

02:36:02.120 --> 02:36:03.120
By the way, guess what?

02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:04.120
Come on, baby, do it.

02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:07.120
I was looking at an old issue of People magazine because I leave those at my work sometimes.

02:36:07.120 --> 02:36:08.120
Uh-huh.

02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:09.120
There was a review for Atomic Kitten in there.

02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:12.120
I know, and I saw an Atomic Kitten video at Faces one night.

02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:13.120
It was cool.

02:36:13.120 --> 02:36:14.120
Yeah, you were there.

02:36:14.120 --> 02:36:15.120
Yeah, I am.

02:36:15.120 --> 02:36:17.120
But they said that they suck.

02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:31.120
A little advice if any of you guys want to get the ladies in the mood, any Thomas Howard song or Jeff Koot, any Jeff Koot song? Yeah, Ladies Will Love You.

02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:38.120
Ladies Will Love Thomas Howard, trust me. Even though he's gay.

02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:44.520
All right, let's get to the elimination part, please.

02:36:44.520 --> 02:36:49.280
Here's the list so far, Gravity, Max 300, Hot Limit, Ecstasy, In The Heat Of The Night,

02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:55.720
Let The Beat Hit Em R&B, Jam Jam Reggae, Sexy Planet, Love Machine, DXY, Sync, Do It All

02:36:55.720 --> 02:36:58.720
Night, Wild Rush, Afronova, and Insertion.

02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:01.040
Jamie, what's coming off the list?

02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:02.720
Jam Jam Raigu.

02:37:02.720 --> 02:37:05.400
You stink.

02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:06.920
Jam Jam Reggae is the best.

02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:11.400
Come on you guys, you stink.

02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:19.080
Mine I'm going to take off, I don't care.

02:37:19.080 --> 02:37:27.200
I'm going to take off, I'm just kind of drawn to the, well, I don't know why, all these

02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:32.240
songs are pretty good, but I just, I don't see gravity so much, so I'm going to take

02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:33.240
off gravity.

02:37:33.240 --> 02:37:34.520
Listen to it.

02:37:34.520 --> 02:37:39.520
I think of stoic, not gravity, so I think it goes back to that whole stoic versus gravity thing.

02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:42.520
Um, no, because Matt's next. Matt?

02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:46.520
I don't care, but, um...

02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:50.520
Tech does not make good sex music. Sync, bye bye.

02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:53.520
You are so full of shit.

02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:55.520
Out phase anyway.

02:37:55.520 --> 02:37:56.520
Whatever.

02:37:56.520 --> 02:37:59.520
Um, Irene?

02:37:59.520 --> 02:38:02.520
I'm gonna take up Hot Limit, because it's stupid.

02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:06.360
thank you

02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:08.680
you big pile and all

02:38:08.680 --> 02:38:13.240
raging ritalin

02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:16.960
I should have said love me too, that would be a good one

02:38:16.960 --> 02:38:18.240
anyway

02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:20.080
uh...

02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:20.800
yeah whatever

02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:26.080
okay I'll say

02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:31.640
uh... I'm gonna have to go with

02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:33.040
Let the beat hit him or be fat.

02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:33.400
Great.

02:38:33.400 --> 02:38:34.160
Vote all nine off.

02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:34.720
Thank you.

02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:35.920
Did all yours get voted on?

02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:36.420
Yes.

02:38:36.420 --> 02:38:36.920
Oh, sorry.

02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:38.120
I didn't notice that.

02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:42.520
I guess Jamie's are all gone.

02:38:42.520 --> 02:38:43.020
I'm sorry.

02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:46.280
All right.

02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:54.120
All right.

02:38:54.120 --> 02:38:55.560
Here's the list.

02:38:55.560 --> 02:38:58.080
And you folks can vote on it right now in the chat room.

02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:05.880
Max300, Ecstasy, and I spelled it wrong, I'm sorry.

02:39:05.880 --> 02:39:10.840
In the Heat of the Night, actually why didn't it come up in my spellcheck then, that's weird.

02:39:10.840 --> 02:39:12.260
I guess so.

02:39:12.260 --> 02:39:20.120
In the Heat of the Night, Sexy Planet, Love Machine, DXY, Do It All Night, Wild Rush,

02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:23.160
Afronova, and Insertion.

02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:26.880
So you can send those votes to me.

02:39:26.880 --> 02:39:29.320
My name is Sky and I'm in the chat room right now.

02:39:29.320 --> 02:39:30.320
Hi!

02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:35.940
And you can send your pics to me over private message because you love me.

02:39:35.940 --> 02:39:47.140
In the meantime, a quick break featuring some more Guitar Freak songs.

02:39:47.140 --> 02:39:52.860
How about, I'm just going to pick random ones from this little CD that Jamie gave me.

02:39:52.860 --> 02:39:55.720
Monkey Magic, that's always a fun one.

02:39:55.720 --> 02:39:59.360
And um, I like Monkey.

02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:07.080
And um, Sweet Feline, or did we, no we already did that one, didn't we?

02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:08.200
I don't think I did that one.

02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:09.200
I don't know.

02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:10.600
Let's do, I'm gonna pick another one.

02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:14.040
How about Star of Muse, yes, that will be fun.

02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:16.800
And then that's all the time you got to send in your votes.

02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:20.120
And we'll be back to wrap up the big, fat, hairy, scary show.

02:40:20.120 --> 02:40:21.680
Stay tuned.

02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:22.680
Yes, Logie?

02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:28.520
Real quickly, because I know I forgot to mention it, but it is big news in case

02:40:28.520 --> 02:40:33.900
if no one's been reading, it sort of ties in with it, the stuff.

02:40:33.900 --> 02:40:38.620
Anyways, the edit code for the DDR Extreme Machine has been found

02:40:38.620 --> 02:40:42.120
and now we can make DDR Extreme edits and have started to do so.

02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:45.260
So, yay. Rejoice.

02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:47.680
All right.

02:40:48.040 --> 02:40:48.500
We'll be back.

02:41:18.500 --> 02:41:22.500
Leave the garden, everybody just have some fun

02:41:23.500 --> 02:41:27.500
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic

02:41:27.500 --> 02:41:31.500
It's Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic

02:41:34.500 --> 02:41:38.500
There's a little, little, monkey magic

02:41:38.500 --> 02:41:42.500
You should find a way to die

02:41:43.500 --> 02:41:47.500
There's a little, little, monkey magic

02:42:17.500 --> 02:42:28.500
Monkey magic, monkey magic, monkey magic

02:45:42.500 --> 02:45:46.500
Come on and love me now

02:45:46.500 --> 02:46:14.500
Home to Hindi, home to Thorns Lounge Radio, home to Hindi, home to Newton, with the ping pong ball!

02:46:14.500 --> 02:46:18.500
Hello everybody.

02:46:18.500 --> 02:46:20.500
So what's going on?

02:46:20.500 --> 02:46:26.500
I think we had to do the winner or something.

02:46:26.500 --> 02:46:27.500
I don't know.

02:46:27.500 --> 02:46:29.500
Supposed to be announcing the winner for something?

02:46:29.500 --> 02:46:30.500
Yeah.

02:46:30.500 --> 02:46:32.500
Yeah, but Rob's occupied.

02:46:32.500 --> 02:46:33.500
Okay, why is it?

02:46:33.500 --> 02:46:34.500
I want to know this.

02:46:34.500 --> 02:46:35.500
Why is it?

02:46:35.500 --> 02:46:40.500
I get, like seriously, when we went on air, did not, did or did not, the house line rang

02:46:40.500 --> 02:46:42.500
and my cell phone went off right when we went on air.

02:46:42.500 --> 02:46:43.500
Then why not turn them off?

02:46:43.500 --> 02:46:48.500
I'm going to. I don't even remember who it was.

02:46:48.500 --> 02:46:50.500
Who was it? I don't know.

02:46:50.500 --> 02:46:54.500
You know, when I used to come for my visitations to under sedation, I would turn off my cell phone.

02:46:54.500 --> 02:46:58.500
My cell phone wouldn't even work in there, and it hasn't been working. That should have been my F.U. of the week.

02:46:58.500 --> 02:47:02.500
Oh my God, my cell phone has not been working in the house even recently, so I'm surprised.

02:47:02.500 --> 02:47:03.500
My cell phone doesn't work in my house.

02:47:03.500 --> 02:47:08.500
It even went off at all. Who was it that called? I don't even remember. I guess, whatever.

02:47:08.500 --> 02:47:37.500
Okay, so, um, let's see, oh yes, the list list, here it is, the top three songs to Unf 2, Have Sexor 2, Get Dirty and Naughty 2, third place, drum roll please, beautiful, Ecstasy, yay, that was number three, Ecstasy, yay, second place,

02:47:37.500 --> 02:47:42.500
The winner is DXY! Yay!

02:47:42.500 --> 02:47:44.500
Yeah, second is DXY.

02:47:44.500 --> 02:47:48.500
And in first place, by a landslide.

02:47:48.500 --> 02:47:50.500
Insertion.

02:47:50.500 --> 02:47:52.500
Of course.

02:47:52.500 --> 02:47:53.500
So.

02:47:56.500 --> 02:47:58.500
That's that.

02:47:58.500 --> 02:48:00.500
Listless, hope you guys enjoyed.

02:48:00.500 --> 02:48:04.500
And an honorary vote for Sky's Voice The Game. You suck!

02:48:04.500 --> 02:48:16.140
And now with some show news, I think we'll be able to do phones next week and I figured

02:48:16.140 --> 02:48:17.860
out a way to do it.

02:48:17.860 --> 02:48:24.420
So if you're interested in being able to do this next week, we're going to be using a

02:48:24.420 --> 02:48:29.820
program probably called Phone Free and I will post a link in the chat room where you can

02:48:29.820 --> 02:48:30.820
and find this program.

02:48:30.820 --> 02:48:32.300
And just basically sign up.

02:48:32.300 --> 02:48:34.620
It's totally free.

02:48:34.620 --> 02:48:36.820
And what you're going to want to do is I'll also give you

02:48:36.820 --> 02:48:40.100
guys an ID number, which will be our phone number.

02:48:40.100 --> 02:48:43.500
And so during the show, we'll have this hopefully available

02:48:43.500 --> 02:48:48.500
live, and I should be able to answer, well, PC phone calls.

02:48:48.500 --> 02:48:50.420
It's not really using your actual phone line.

02:48:50.420 --> 02:48:53.460
Phone line is just almost like voice chatting over, like,

02:48:53.460 --> 02:48:55.260
Yahoo Instant Messenger or something like that.

02:48:55.260 --> 02:48:57.260
So maybe we're going to try that.

02:48:57.260 --> 02:48:58.660
But anyways, I'll post links.

02:48:58.660 --> 02:49:05.660
We'll probably test it out during a fuck-off show sometime in the next week, like before the weekend, I don't know.

02:49:05.660 --> 02:49:09.660
Are you planning on doing any fuck-off shows this week, Jamie? I know you were thinking about, yeah.

02:49:09.660 --> 02:49:12.660
I sort of preempted the rewind Monday.

02:49:12.660 --> 02:49:18.660
It's all good. You know what? The way I think about it, the fuck-offs get more listeners than the rewinds anyway, so it's all good.

02:49:18.660 --> 02:49:23.660
You know, I think, you know, for me it's easier just to come home and do it on Monday.

02:49:23.660 --> 02:49:25.660
Because I'm sort of angsty anyway.

02:49:25.660 --> 02:49:27.660
Do you want to move the rewind? We can always move the rewind.

02:49:27.660 --> 02:49:29.660
I don't care about when we do the rewind.

02:49:29.660 --> 02:49:30.660
Well, we can talk...

02:49:30.660 --> 02:49:31.660
This is the chat room.

02:49:31.660 --> 02:49:33.660
Chat room, go on the live journal community.

02:49:33.660 --> 02:49:34.660
Yes, I was going to say.

02:49:34.660 --> 02:49:35.660
There you go.

02:49:35.660 --> 02:49:36.660
There you go.

02:49:36.660 --> 02:49:37.660
Excellent idea.

02:49:37.660 --> 02:49:40.660
Kathy, start a thread on the live journal community and everyone let us know what would

02:49:40.660 --> 02:49:45.660
be the, if you would leave the rewind on Monday or just keep the Thursday one the way it is

02:49:45.660 --> 02:49:46.660
or whatever.

02:49:46.660 --> 02:49:48.660
We can always move the Monday rewind to Tuesday as well.

02:49:48.660 --> 02:49:50.660
We could just do both of them on Thursday.

02:49:50.660 --> 02:49:51.660
That's a possibility too.

02:49:51.660 --> 02:49:53.660
Run them back to back to back.

02:49:53.660 --> 02:49:54.660
Or Wednesday or whatever.

02:49:54.660 --> 02:49:56.660
Or Saturday afternoon or something.

02:49:56.660 --> 02:49:57.660
Just let us know.

02:49:57.660 --> 02:49:59.660
No, we cannot do it on Saturday afternoon.

02:49:59.660 --> 02:50:01.660
Is that when Understation Live is up?

02:50:01.660 --> 02:50:03.660
We want to encourage people to listen to Understation Live.

02:50:03.660 --> 02:50:04.660
Oh, I didn't realize they were on.

02:50:04.660 --> 02:50:05.660
I thought they moved to Friday.

02:50:05.660 --> 02:50:06.660
I thought they were still doing it on Saturday.

02:50:06.660 --> 02:50:07.660
I thought they moved to Friday.

02:50:07.660 --> 02:50:08.660
I'll check.

02:50:08.660 --> 02:50:09.660
I'll check.

02:50:09.660 --> 02:50:10.660
But you're right.

02:50:10.660 --> 02:50:11.660
We don't want to interfere with Understation Live.

02:50:11.660 --> 02:50:12.660
So I'll check.

02:50:12.660 --> 02:50:13.660
Because we love them.

02:50:13.660 --> 02:50:14.660
Yeah, I'll check and make sure they didn't.

02:50:14.660 --> 02:50:15.660
I thought they moved to Friday.

02:50:15.660 --> 02:50:16.660
We'll see.

02:50:16.660 --> 02:50:17.660
Okay.

02:50:17.660 --> 02:50:22.660
In other show news, Arcadian reminded me of this.

02:50:22.660 --> 02:50:23.660
Arcadian42, thank you.

02:50:23.660 --> 02:50:24.660
I forgot to point this out.

02:50:24.660 --> 02:50:30.120
But everybody, look at the person next to you and give them a big pat on the back.

02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:31.620
I don't see some pats on the back.

02:50:31.620 --> 02:50:36.460
Yes, pat people on the back because, ladies and gentlemen, this week, Orange Lounge Radio

02:50:36.460 --> 02:50:39.460
crossed 2,500 total listening hours.

02:50:39.460 --> 02:50:40.460
Yay!

02:50:40.460 --> 02:50:42.900
That's the highest we've ever been.

02:50:42.900 --> 02:50:43.900
Congratulations.

02:50:43.900 --> 02:50:44.900
We're high.

02:50:44.900 --> 02:50:47.500
And that's because of a lot of hard work from a lot of people.

02:50:47.500 --> 02:50:50.700
And some events that happened this month certainly helped.

02:50:50.700 --> 02:50:54.740
I think we were Bamani-style side of the week for a while, which really helped the website

02:50:54.740 --> 02:50:55.980
hit.

02:50:55.980 --> 02:50:59.220
Our B3 coverage helped a lot too, and the shows have been doing really well.

02:50:59.220 --> 02:51:01.140
So the fuck off shows and everything.

02:51:01.140 --> 02:51:02.620
So everybody's done a great job.

02:51:02.620 --> 02:51:03.620
Yay.

02:51:03.620 --> 02:51:09.180
And also I am going to start doing, well I'm going to be going to school, so I don't know,

02:51:09.180 --> 02:51:13.040
I may have to change the night that I do this, but I am going to be doing at least one regular

02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:15.500
fuck off a week.

02:51:15.500 --> 02:51:16.500
One regular fuck off a week?

02:51:16.500 --> 02:51:19.340
And I think that this week I might do video game trivia.

02:51:19.340 --> 02:51:20.340
Ooh.

02:51:20.340 --> 02:51:26.340
I have to find my CDs or re-download stuff, but maybe not this week, but next week for sure.

02:51:26.340 --> 02:51:30.340
I'll get all the stuff ready to do music trivia.

02:51:30.340 --> 02:51:33.340
Cool. Very cool.

02:51:33.340 --> 02:51:37.340
And, yeah, that'll be fun. And I'll do a fuck-off show at some point this week, too. Probably later.

02:51:37.340 --> 02:51:43.340
I tend to do them, like, whenever I'm just, like, here, Friday or Saturday, late night.

02:51:43.340 --> 02:51:45.340
I need to figure out how to get them to run while I'm doing writing a lot.

02:51:45.340 --> 02:51:46.340
Uh-huh.

02:51:46.340 --> 02:51:48.340
I need to figure out how to get them to do while I'm doing RO.

02:51:48.340 --> 02:51:51.340
I am seriously thinking about getting a Ragnarok account this week, finally.

02:51:51.340 --> 02:51:54.340
Uh-huh! Play on, play on, play on Chaos.

02:51:54.340 --> 02:51:56.340
Chaos.

02:51:56.340 --> 02:52:00.340
To make everybody happy, I'm obviously going to have to have to have one character on both.

02:52:00.340 --> 02:52:04.340
But, but this is the thing, then I can have two different classes.

02:52:04.340 --> 02:52:06.340
That's okay, one of them can be like my learning.

02:52:06.340 --> 02:52:14.340
We'll see. I figure when I do my next job class, I'm going to do it on, um, if I do a merchant, I'm going to do it on Chaos, so I can buy stuff cheap for my character.

02:52:14.340 --> 02:52:20.340
But if I do any other job class, I'm going to do it on the Loki server.

02:52:20.340 --> 02:52:22.340
I might do a Sakurai one, though.

02:52:22.340 --> 02:52:24.340
I started a Sakurai one.

02:52:24.340 --> 02:52:28.340
There's three character slots for each server independent to each server.

02:52:28.340 --> 02:52:31.340
So you can start three classes on each server.

02:52:31.340 --> 02:52:37.340
And Loki's got technically less people on it at most times because Chaos was the original server.

02:52:37.340 --> 02:52:40.340
So there's more or a lot of people who were there since the beginning.

02:52:40.340 --> 02:52:44.340
So, if you want less lag, really there's not much lag on Chaos either.

02:52:44.340 --> 02:52:47.340
I mean, because they only have like around 5,000 at the most.

02:52:47.340 --> 02:52:50.340
I mean, I don't think that's 5,000, so.

02:52:50.340 --> 02:52:54.340
Okay, so it, yeah, I mean, it doesn't really matter what server you start on.

02:52:54.340 --> 02:52:58.340
Just whichever one has more of your friends on it, go to that one, I guess.

02:52:58.340 --> 02:53:04.340
I don't know, whatever. I probably won't even end up signing up, because, like, you know, I...

02:53:04.340 --> 02:53:06.340
You're a poser!

02:53:06.340 --> 02:53:34.340
We did get a lot of listening hours, however our actual rating for the station has fallen quite a bit in the past week.

02:53:34.340 --> 02:53:41.380
I have a feeling I'm not gonna I have a feeling we're zero being zero bombed by another by another station

02:53:41.380 --> 02:53:47.480
I think I think I'm just suspecting and I'm probably creating conspiracies to be there, but I noticed that the rating for another

02:53:48.180 --> 02:53:50.180
Bamani station

02:53:50.900 --> 02:53:56.620
Has gone up significantly while ours has gone down some I'm wondering if something's going on there. I don't know

02:53:56.740 --> 02:54:01.220
Yeah, that's really unprofessional. I don't know. I don't know if it's true. I'm probably suspecting things

02:54:01.220 --> 02:54:03.300
I shouldn't be, and going places I don't need to go.

02:54:03.300 --> 02:54:06.660
I wouldn't listen to another station who did that.

02:54:06.660 --> 02:54:08.140
I wouldn't either.

02:54:08.140 --> 02:54:10.700
Poser's.

02:54:10.700 --> 02:54:13.860
Oh, I listen to another station, but I have an obligation.

02:54:13.860 --> 02:54:15.140
Not just an obligation to me.

02:54:15.140 --> 02:54:18.180
Well, I hate for that other station's thing

02:54:18.180 --> 02:54:19.260
that happened to them.

02:54:19.260 --> 02:54:22.020
Because you know what comes around, you know.

02:54:22.020 --> 02:54:23.660
I need to say right now, right now,

02:54:23.660 --> 02:54:25.600
it's not under station live, obviously.

02:54:25.600 --> 02:54:26.980
It's not DDR Freak.

02:54:26.980 --> 02:54:28.660
DDR Freak Radio and Orange Mountains Radio

02:54:28.660 --> 02:54:30.780
kind of have a silent agreement on where we're not going to go.

02:54:30.780 --> 02:54:39.780
I'd like to give a very big thank you to the powers that be with DDR Freak Radio for being very considerate of us two.

02:54:39.780 --> 02:54:46.780
I think we need to be partners. All of us Bimani stations, we need to be partners in this and not snipe each other.

02:54:46.780 --> 02:54:51.780
Not just Petty, but all of us are working to promote the games and the music.

02:54:51.780 --> 02:54:57.780
I hope nobody came in in the middle of this and is thinking that a specific station that we know of has been doing this.

02:54:57.780 --> 02:55:05.780
I really don't know. Rob said it again, that he doesn't know. He's not interesting. It's just interesting that one goes down and one goes up. It's just interesting, that's all.

02:55:05.780 --> 02:55:13.780
Yeah, and in all honesty, I've looked at a lot of like 365 stations and Orange Lounge is like really the only entertaining one. I'm sorry.

02:55:13.780 --> 02:55:21.780
I personally like to listen to talk. If I want to listen to music, I'll just find pictures of the music files somewhere online.

02:55:21.780 --> 02:55:50.180
If you want to check other stations out, we're not total Nazi radio people.

02:55:50.180 --> 02:55:55.180
Go vote for them however you want to vote, but for us, vote a five.

02:55:55.180 --> 02:55:56.180
Yes, vote five.

02:55:56.180 --> 02:55:59.180
There is no choice, so if you have your little Live 365 window up...

02:55:59.180 --> 02:56:01.180
There's other numbers that pretend and don't work, so hit five.

02:56:01.180 --> 02:56:06.180
If you have your Live 365 window up right now, just change that little vote in the bottom to a five, and we would love that.

02:56:06.180 --> 02:56:08.180
And we'll come to your house and have sex with you, just kidding.

02:56:08.180 --> 02:56:10.180
No, we'll send the monkeys.

02:56:10.180 --> 02:56:17.180
Rob can't see this, because Live 365 doesn't supply this kind of technology for him to see the IPs of the people voting.

02:56:17.180 --> 02:56:27.180
But I can, because I have something that spikes in the middle and finds it, and so I can see who's voting bad, you know, and I will fucking blow up your computer. So don't vote anything low.

02:56:27.180 --> 02:56:29.180
So send our leaked Shema grad after you.

02:56:29.180 --> 02:56:34.180
I was just kidding, I can't. I'm a loser. I'm a fucking script kitty.

02:56:34.180 --> 02:56:44.140
Well, that being said, our little help us be the high rated station as opposed to going

02:56:44.140 --> 02:56:46.980
down the crapper where we've been going recently.

02:56:46.980 --> 02:56:48.580
I think it's time to wrap up the show.

02:56:48.580 --> 02:56:49.580
What do you guys say?

02:56:49.580 --> 02:56:50.580
Sure.

02:56:50.580 --> 02:56:51.580
What are we going to wrap it up in?

02:56:51.580 --> 02:56:52.580
Ribbons and bows?

02:56:52.580 --> 02:56:54.180
We're going to wrap it up in pretty pink paper.

02:56:54.180 --> 02:56:55.580
Leather and pantyhose.

02:56:55.580 --> 02:56:56.580
Yes.

02:56:56.580 --> 02:56:57.580
Okay.

02:56:57.580 --> 02:56:58.580
Final thought time.

02:56:58.580 --> 02:56:59.580
Let's start with our guests.

02:56:59.580 --> 02:57:00.580
Lanky style.

02:57:00.580 --> 02:57:02.580
Your final thought, please.

02:57:02.580 --> 02:57:05.580
Bye Bye Bye by NSYNC and DDR. What?

02:57:07.580 --> 02:57:09.580
Rice Princess, your final thought?

02:57:09.580 --> 02:57:11.580
Hi. And bye.

02:57:12.580 --> 02:57:14.580
Loki, your final thought?

02:57:15.580 --> 02:57:19.580
I'll get these films to work. It kills me.

02:57:22.580 --> 02:57:25.580
My final thought is...

02:57:27.580 --> 02:57:30.580
I don't know. That's my final thought. I just don't know anymore.

02:57:30.580 --> 02:57:39.580
any more. Jamie? My final thought is give me money. And play Ragnarok on the chaos server.

02:57:42.580 --> 02:57:51.580
Just play Ragnarok. Okay, so I'm trying to queue up the outro still, sorry. Does anybody

02:57:51.580 --> 02:57:55.580
have an additional final thought? Yeah, I do. What? My frogs are cool, because they

02:57:55.580 --> 02:58:03.500
cool because they have blue stars in them and my cat's butt stinks oh yay I

02:58:03.500 --> 02:58:11.700
love your fortune cookie message okay and the final word of the show goes to

02:58:11.700 --> 02:58:17.180
Jamie the final word of the night is

02:58:17.380 --> 02:58:24.220
crack whore you've been listening to orange lounge radio orange lounge radio

02:58:24.220 --> 02:58:27.460
It was hosted by Dark Sakura, Skye, and Loki.

02:58:27.460 --> 02:58:29.740
We expect you a nice play again.

02:58:29.740 --> 02:58:34.300
And now, here's your Fortune Cookie message of the day.

02:58:34.300 --> 02:58:40.020
I inherited my father's eyes and my mother's eating disorder.

02:58:40.020 --> 02:58:42.140
My mother and I have the same eating disorder.

02:58:42.140 --> 02:58:46.980
She just said to me, when I was pregnant with you,

02:58:46.980 --> 02:58:49.540
I eat only cherry.

02:58:49.540 --> 02:58:53.980
And I think that you are just one big cherry.

02:58:53.980 --> 02:59:00.980
You are just a one big gay kitty!

02:59:05.800 --> 02:59:11.700
I was on the cover of The Star once, and it was for this thing called the Chow Like Cho Diet.

02:59:11.700 --> 02:59:20.580
I was so fucking racist, because they just made this diet up. They didn't consult me. I mean, it was like this total diet that they made up that they said that I went on, and all these fake quotes from me.

02:59:20.580 --> 02:59:24.220
When I was young, I was raised on rice and fish.

02:59:24.220 --> 02:59:29.140
So when I get heavy, I go back to that natural Asian way of eating.

02:59:29.140 --> 02:59:33.780
You can almost hear the mandolin in the background.

02:59:33.780 --> 02:59:38.780
When I was a little girl and I grow up on the rice paddy,

02:59:38.780 --> 02:59:44.260
we don't have any food because this was before Sally's brother.

02:59:44.260 --> 03:00:01.260
So, we are so hungry all the time and we have no money and I want to go to the market to buy a chicken head but I have no money so I have to sell my finger.

03:00:01.260 --> 03:00:12.260
But I was very hungry, but I still have a tendency to put on weight,

03:00:12.260 --> 03:00:16.260
which is why I really hope that I catch malaria,

03:00:16.260 --> 03:00:22.260
because that is a very good way to lose weight quickly, malaria and dysentery.

03:00:22.260 --> 03:00:28.340
Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:00:52.260 --> 03:01:11.860
The afterbirth of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:01:11.860 --> 03:01:12.860
Here we are.

03:01:12.860 --> 03:01:13.860
So, what's up, kids?

03:01:13.860 --> 03:01:14.860
Let me think.

03:01:14.860 --> 03:01:15.860
Hi, monster.

03:01:15.860 --> 03:01:16.860
You don't belong in this world.

03:01:16.860 --> 03:01:17.860
You take them souls.

03:01:17.860 --> 03:01:18.860
Invake them you're slaves.

03:01:18.860 --> 03:01:22.860
You take them souls and make them your slaves!

03:01:22.860 --> 03:01:25.860
Are you going to do that as a fortune cookie one week?

03:01:25.860 --> 03:01:27.860
Same could be said of all religions.

03:01:27.860 --> 03:01:31.860
I guess you're just going to act it out. I don't even know it. All I know is the die monster part.

03:01:31.860 --> 03:01:33.860
And then the grim reaper.

03:01:33.860 --> 03:01:34.860
I could do it from the beginning.

03:01:34.860 --> 03:01:35.860
Do it! Do it!

03:01:35.860 --> 03:01:37.860
Right now?

03:01:37.860 --> 03:01:40.860
Actually there was supposed to be an ending where Maria turned evil.

03:01:40.860 --> 03:01:44.860
The sound files on the game.

03:01:44.860 --> 03:01:48.860
She's like, like, who would have thought such a little girl had so much power?

03:01:48.860 --> 03:01:52.860
You know, but she's like the best.

03:01:52.860 --> 03:01:56.860
And, um, I like the Grim Reaper part. Ah, I know God.

03:01:56.860 --> 03:02:00.860
I love his voice. Okay, do the intro.

03:02:00.860 --> 03:02:04.860
The Dark Priest Shaft.

03:02:04.860 --> 03:02:08.860
Do the intro to Castlevania, please. Do it, Brad, do it.

03:02:08.860 --> 03:02:12.860
Okay, I need to get my, like, wine glass and my

03:02:12.860 --> 03:02:16.180
Dracula teeth, come on. I'm so excited.

03:02:16.180 --> 03:02:19.540
Don't look at me, everybody look around. Don't look at me.

03:02:19.540 --> 03:02:23.340
Die, monster. You don't belong in this world.

03:02:23.340 --> 03:02:26.300
Somebody else has to do the Dracula part.

03:02:26.300 --> 03:02:29.900
I don't know the Dracula part, so you just have to do your Dracula voice.

03:02:29.900 --> 03:02:34.280
It was not by my hand that I was once again given flesh.

03:02:34.280 --> 03:02:39.060
I was brought here by humans who used to wish to pay me tribute.

03:02:39.060 --> 03:02:43.060
Trueboot, you steal men's souls and make them your slaves.

03:02:43.060 --> 03:02:46.060
Perhaps the same could be said of all religions.

03:02:46.060 --> 03:02:49.060
Your words are as empty as your soul.

03:02:49.060 --> 03:02:52.060
Mankind ill needs a savior such as you.

03:02:52.060 --> 03:02:53.060
What is a man?

03:02:53.060 --> 03:02:55.060
For a little wine glass.

03:02:55.060 --> 03:02:57.060
A miserable little pile of secrets.

03:02:57.060 --> 03:03:00.060
But enough talk, how about you?

03:03:00.060 --> 03:03:02.060
Yay, that's beautiful.

03:03:02.060 --> 03:03:06.060
That is the best dialogue out of any video game ever in the history of mankind.

03:03:06.060 --> 03:03:08.060
The acting is perfect, I don't care what you think.

03:03:08.060 --> 03:03:09.060
Here, what do you think?

03:03:09.060 --> 03:03:12.060
Loki, can you make a remix using those lines?

03:03:12.060 --> 03:03:15.060
That's why you wanted me to do it.

03:03:15.060 --> 03:03:18.060
I knew, I should have known that's why you wanted me to do that.

03:03:18.060 --> 03:03:20.060
Brad's voice in the game.

03:03:20.060 --> 03:03:22.060
I've got, I could give you the whole thing in Japanese.

03:03:22.060 --> 03:03:24.060
Die, monster.

03:03:24.060 --> 03:03:25.060
Die, monster.

03:03:25.060 --> 03:03:31.060
I should, I should, I should actually copy off my Japanese one too and play it for you.

03:03:31.060 --> 03:03:34.060
Dude, it sounds really, really cool.

03:03:34.060 --> 03:03:39.060
I might do something like that, but unfortunately, my name starts with an M.

03:03:43.060 --> 03:03:44.060
What?

03:03:44.060 --> 03:03:45.060
What?

03:03:45.060 --> 03:03:54.060
In other words, I'm not a person that also has four letters in their name, begins with a T, ends with a win, and makes stupid remixes, so there.

03:03:54.060 --> 03:03:56.060
Okay, then I'll do it.

03:03:56.060 --> 03:04:00.060
Hey, you know what that is backwards? It's Newt.

03:04:00.060 --> 03:04:08.380
Well now, I'm going to make a remix called the beauty of silence mix and it's just going

03:04:08.380 --> 03:04:13.500
to go the beauty of silence and then like a minute of silence and I'm going to say see

03:04:13.500 --> 03:04:14.500
it's beautiful.

03:04:14.500 --> 03:04:22.220
So half in the background, too pretty.

03:04:22.220 --> 03:04:26.700
And then like sex noises in the back and kittens getting choked.

03:04:26.700 --> 03:04:27.700
Just kidding.

03:04:27.700 --> 03:04:33.700
Oh, do you want to give a plug to going to vote for Shermie?

03:04:33.700 --> 03:04:42.700
I put Shermie's picture up on RateMyKitten.com, but it's not up there yet and I actually don't know where her site is for her picture.

03:04:42.700 --> 03:04:45.700
So she's just on there somewhere.

03:04:45.700 --> 03:04:52.700
It's a picture of Shermie on Mel's lap being sleepy and cute.

03:04:52.700 --> 03:04:54.700
Yay.

03:04:54.700 --> 03:04:58.700
Okay, so does anybody else have anything they want to say for the wrap-up here?

03:04:58.700 --> 03:05:00.700
The afterbirth?

03:05:00.700 --> 03:05:01.700
Yes.

03:05:01.700 --> 03:05:03.700
I'm fucking hungry, man.

03:05:03.700 --> 03:05:05.700
There's a bunch of snack foods up there.

03:05:05.700 --> 03:05:07.700
I don't want snack foods. I want a meal!

03:05:07.700 --> 03:05:08.700
You're on a diet.

03:05:08.700 --> 03:05:11.700
No, I just want a meal. I'm tired of eating all these sneaky snacks and stuff.

03:05:11.700 --> 03:05:13.700
Aw, poor thing.

03:05:13.700 --> 03:05:14.700
I know, poor thing.

03:05:14.700 --> 03:05:16.700
You can eat my dick.

03:05:16.700 --> 03:05:19.700
Oh, God, that's too many calories.

03:05:19.700 --> 03:05:24.700
It's sweet. I promise you it's sweet. It's full of fat. And high-end fiber.

03:05:28.700 --> 03:05:33.700
Alright, kids. What, did somebody fart or something? You all have played your...

03:05:35.700 --> 03:05:40.700
Wait, yes, Loki? Loki has something he'd like to share with you all. I'm scared.

03:05:43.700 --> 03:05:48.700
We just had like a bunch of radio silence. I know. Mumble, mumble, mumble.

03:05:48.700 --> 03:05:54.700
such great radio here. That's bullshit.

03:05:54.700 --> 03:06:00.700
Are you trying to do the poodle hat thing? You want to play a poodle hat track?

03:06:00.700 --> 03:06:05.700
Okay, Loki wants to play a poodle hat track for you all.

03:06:05.700 --> 03:06:11.700
A hat rack? What?

03:06:11.700 --> 03:06:16.700
It's quiet. Yeah, I know. This is shitty radio.

03:06:16.700 --> 03:06:22.700
You talk. I do too much talking. People complain that I talk too much, so I'm dumb.

03:06:22.700 --> 03:06:25.700
Why do you talk too much? Shut up. You know what I mean.

03:06:25.700 --> 03:06:32.700
People visit our live journal, everybody visit our forums, everybody vote us a five, listen to us all day long.

03:06:32.700 --> 03:06:47.420
Look, if you had one shot to sit on your lazy butt and watch all the TV you ever wanted

03:06:47.420 --> 03:06:53.420
until your brain turned to mush, would you go for it or just let it slip?

03:06:53.420 --> 03:06:53.920
Yo

03:07:23.420 --> 03:07:27.420
Insanity, oh, the fat crappin' Behold, of depravity, no

03:07:27.420 --> 03:07:31.420
They live happily, yo, cross the alley To show and celebrity mold

03:07:31.420 --> 03:07:35.420
Oh, the van and the coal Keep scaring me, look, monocavity

03:07:35.420 --> 03:07:38.420
Oh, it's a station break Better go out to the kitchen or microwave salt

03:07:38.420 --> 03:07:42.420
I'm gonna lose with your mom watchin' TV They told me they told me

03:07:42.420 --> 03:07:47.420
But I still do it in every show Like they will be C-SPAN, TV, Landon, HBO

03:07:47.420 --> 03:07:51.420
The travel channel is gonna burn in lifetime I'm gonna lose with your mom watchin' TV

03:07:51.420 --> 03:07:55.420
I'm watching TV, they told me, they told me, turn off all music videos

03:07:55.420 --> 03:07:58.420
I'm gonna watch C-SPAN TV, land in HBO

03:07:58.420 --> 03:08:01.420
Stay up through channel 9, QVC, a lifetime power

03:08:01.420 --> 03:08:04.420
My blood is aching, as I watch NASCAR racing

03:08:04.420 --> 03:08:07.420
That show about undertaking, where it came

03:08:07.420 --> 03:08:11.420
The 24 to line order, the weather channel's boring

03:08:11.420 --> 03:08:14.420
Like 50 minutes of ancient reporters

03:08:14.420 --> 03:08:16.420
Next up aren't you through Hollywood story

03:08:16.420 --> 03:08:19.420
The rise and decline of pro actors in glory

03:08:19.420 --> 03:08:22.100
It goes for next fall, they already been namin'

03:08:22.100 --> 03:08:24.820
This is D.S.I. gravy, touched by an uncle

03:08:24.820 --> 03:08:26.340
But it sounds pretty lamin'

03:08:26.340 --> 03:08:29.140
So does everybody tolerate Raymond

03:08:29.140 --> 03:08:31.860
And King of Queens jumped the shark the first minute

03:08:31.860 --> 03:08:34.620
I can't believe Richard Simmons ain't in it

03:08:34.620 --> 03:08:36.900
I'll move right on the way to Central Rules

03:08:36.900 --> 03:08:38.780
So where's my teenage daughter?

03:08:38.780 --> 03:08:41.020
Then I bet I watch The Bachelorette

03:08:41.020 --> 03:08:42.780
Followed by Welcome Back Potter

03:08:42.780 --> 03:08:44.020
And The Muppet Show

03:08:44.020 --> 03:08:44.780
Where they goin'

03:08:44.780 --> 03:08:46.540
And I'm all gonna use your mind

03:08:46.540 --> 03:08:48.820
Watchin' TV, they told me they told me

03:08:48.820 --> 03:08:50.420
But I still do it in every show

03:08:50.420 --> 03:08:53.580
Like Gable, G-SPAN, TV Land, and HBO

03:08:53.580 --> 03:08:56.140
They're just in channel in the A&E and Lifetime

03:08:56.140 --> 03:08:58.420
You're gonna lose your mind watching TV

03:08:58.420 --> 03:08:59.820
They told me, cuz told me

03:08:59.820 --> 03:09:01.420
But after last year's I could go

03:09:01.420 --> 03:09:04.620
I'm making a G-SPAN, TV Land, and HBO

03:09:04.620 --> 03:09:07.020
The type of channeling for a TV lifetime

03:09:07.020 --> 03:09:10.020
Never gonna miss another place I lost in space

03:09:10.020 --> 03:09:12.820
I've seen each amazing race without a trace

03:09:12.820 --> 03:09:15.620
But I only watched Willie race one time, one day

03:09:15.620 --> 03:09:18.220
Wish I hadn't, cuz G-bo, now peace I'm gay

03:09:18.220 --> 03:09:21.080
Oh, and here's a factor I watched maybe a h-hour

03:09:21.080 --> 03:09:23.880
After that, felt like I needed a long shower

03:09:23.880 --> 03:09:26.620
Network execs with naked ambitions

03:09:26.620 --> 03:09:29.320
Next week on Fox, watch Lion be Christian

03:09:29.320 --> 03:09:32.120
Life's a tie-up, don't program any planners

03:09:32.120 --> 03:09:36.320
Make them watch all of that junk till their heads explode just like scanners

03:09:36.320 --> 03:09:39.120
Reach covered gravity, you fool of survivors

03:09:39.120 --> 03:09:41.820
Look at James Whitten discussing the Uber

03:09:41.820 --> 03:09:45.020
Of Mr. Rob Schneider and the Gilligan in Spongebob, but

03:09:45.020 --> 03:09:50.520
Where's my guy Baranci, Leno, who's got Madonna, haters, Luke, Terry, and a special all-pick Latin episode

03:09:50.520 --> 03:09:52.520
It's Drew Carey, why'd I turn out his teeth?

03:09:52.520 --> 03:09:55.320
Cuz I'm a gossip freak, and I gotta know who J-Lo is

03:09:55.320 --> 03:09:57.820
Cuz Mary-Anne is weak, a thirty second plot

03:09:57.820 --> 03:10:01.820
Now looking back to R.U. Pot, I was fine and I'm recording the Sopranos

03:10:01.820 --> 03:10:04.920
Ooh, I forgot, I left your whisper without a plot

03:10:04.920 --> 03:10:07.720
I'll stare at all my legs in love, my eyes bloodshot

03:10:07.720 --> 03:10:10.520
Because I'm only a guy with one brain to write

03:10:10.520 --> 03:10:13.020
I'm gonna spend my life rockin' television, so why?

03:10:13.020 --> 03:10:15.360
If you're gonna use it you're all watchin' TV

03:10:15.360 --> 03:10:16.560
They told me they told me

03:10:16.560 --> 03:10:18.200
But I've still the one in every show

03:10:18.200 --> 03:10:20.180
I gave a big speech band in TV

03:10:20.180 --> 03:10:21.420
Lined in HBO

03:10:21.420 --> 03:10:23.220
Helped fight with Channel and AMC

03:10:23.220 --> 03:10:24.560
And lifetime goes

03:10:24.560 --> 03:10:26.280
Use if you're my watchin' TV

03:10:26.280 --> 03:10:27.340
They told me, they told me

03:10:27.340 --> 03:10:29.380
Turn up like Oprah with your show

03:10:29.380 --> 03:10:31.140
I gave a large speech band in TV

03:10:31.140 --> 03:10:32.440
Lined in HBO

03:10:32.440 --> 03:10:34.260
Helped learn to channel and AMC

03:10:34.260 --> 03:10:35.560
And lifetime goes

03:10:35.560 --> 03:10:47.960
Good dear lord, this is like the longest afterbirth ever.

03:10:47.960 --> 03:10:52.320
That's okay though, right?

03:10:52.320 --> 03:10:55.160
Anything else want to be said about Weird Al or anything?

03:10:55.160 --> 03:10:56.160
Yes.

03:10:56.160 --> 03:10:57.160
What?

03:10:57.160 --> 03:10:58.160
Woah!

03:10:58.160 --> 03:10:59.160
Woah!

03:10:59.160 --> 03:11:05.480
Alright, before we murder your eardrums further, I think it's time to put the proverbial bullet

03:11:05.480 --> 03:11:14.160
