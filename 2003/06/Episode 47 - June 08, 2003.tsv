8177	12360	Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
15943	20827	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, for Monty Talk and then some.
21528	24230	Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.
24590	28654	Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.
29214	33978	Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.
34608	38355	You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
38636	40118	Yes, I will spank your child.
40519	42262	If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.
44887	45048	Well...
47952	49133	Here's my big opening.
49593	50734	A sphincter says what?
50914	53035	I'm super, thanks for asking.
53395	55976	Oh, you little bitch trove from hell.
56016	57657	What am I doing here?
58057	59658	No.
59878	61219	Dodge this.
61679	63560	This is a tasty burger.
63780	66282	Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.
66462	67102	Yes, I have.
67522	69343	Look, there's a flesh wound.
69564	75607	Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a polyshorum.
76753	77554	Oh, yeah?
77694	80995	Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.
81236	82296	DarkSakura.
82516	83357	I've got a sniff.
83637	84217	Skye.
84297	86378	But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.
86759	87279	Loki.
87519	88520	I hate you!
88960	90981	Orange Lounge Radio.
92342	97685	We are live, and this is episode number 48 for June the 8th of 2003.
98365	104929	You're tuned in to the Beemani Scene's most bitchy radio station of all things Beemani.
105936	108116	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
109417	111257	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
111317	114298	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Jamie.
114478	115498	Miss Summers, if you're nasty.
115538	116898	Shut up, I'm watching Transformers.
118799	120299	You know her better as DarkSakura.
121159	124520	In that corner, say hello to our TechMassa Loki.
124960	125280	Hello.
126300	127201	I lied, you guys.
127221	127841	This is episode number 47, not 48.
127881	128081	My bad.
128101	128921	I lost count.
128961	129161	Oops.
135267	135887	So what?
136108	137168	Everybody makes mistakes.
137228	137809	Leave me alone.
139810	140431	Go away.
140571	140991	Die.
142873	145995	Also with us tonight, say hello to nobody.
148377	148997	That's right.
149577	149998	It's empty.
150058	152179	It's a ghost town here in Orange Lounge Radio headquarters.
154841	156663	Nobody loves Orange Lounge Radio anymore.
157723	158324	I had a cry.
160561	161422	I missed it.
162423	165785	They showed, like, the crappiest Transformers, though, when they showed the commercials.
165906	168928	And we're getting phone calls as if we could, like, take calls on the show.
169128	170069	I'm getting more carrots.
170790	171430	How rude.
172291	173432	I am being a good girl today.
174132	175033	How are you being a good girl?
175053	175894	I'm eating carrots.
177836	178656	As opposed to?
179337	180097	Eating candy.
182399	182780	Alrighty.
183701	190265	Well, we'll be talking to us, ourselves, since there's no guests here, we'll just be talking to ourselves a little later.
191566	197609	And first, we're going to take a quick break, though, featuring some five key songs.
199030	199870	Yay!
200451	204253	And this first song is called Waterflame, and it's by Kay.
205314	211617	And actually, a buddy of mine, Navi, who's been on the show before, he picked up the Kay album not too long ago.
211677	212298	It's pretty cool.
212538	212718	Cool.
213601	213841	Yes.
214522	216525	So, lots of fun stuff coming up tonight.
217026	219490	We're going to do listless tonight because we haven't done it in forever.
220151	221993	And, yeah.
222234	223676	So, enjoy.
223776	224257	We'll be back.
364412	365513	Thanks for watching!
400326	406111	In the city where neon lights shine, that person left a shadow and disappeared.
406131	408814	Suddenly, he said goodbye and said he loved me.
408934	412837	At that time, I realized that memories are in dreams.
412857	414458	They wake up when they're forgotten.
429054	434836	I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
498688	499632	I do it, I do it
537521	539923	It's more contagious than SARS.
541405	543267	It's Orange Lounge Radio.
544088	544888	That's right.
545209	546830	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
548091	550774	And you just listened to a whole bunch of 5 key songs.
551174	551995	Didn't you enjoy that?
553036	556380	Athletics with Disco Dog from 7th Mix.
556460	557921	Before that, Love to Me.
558161	559763	Hey, Athletics did Please Don't Go.
559943	560343	That's right.
560423	561805	Athletics also did War Game, right?
562392	562712	I think.
563052	568276	Before that, the Japanese version of Love to Me, as it's easily called, from Third Mix.
568576	569256	That's debatable.
570777	579543	Before that, GTS featuring Melody Sexton from Fourth Mix, Brand New World, and starting that off, K from Seventh Mix with Water Flames.
579623	581184	I can't get my single propeller open.
581344	583325	That sounds like that Margaret Cho joke.
583385	584326	Water's flame.
586860	588861	So yeah, it's pretty mellow here tonight.
588901	590822	We don't really have a whole lot going on.
591662	595564	Not a lot going on in the land of Orange Lounge Radio this week.
595664	599465	Actually, there were a lot of changes that happened at the station on June 1st.
599525	601026	Hopefully they've been invisible to you.
601874	604915	There's been some positive changes and there's been some negative changes.
605135	606575	And this is all due to Live365.
607135	610596	Positive changes, we've been given a lot more web space.
611136	613856	So, we're gonna add a whole bunch of new songs.
614076	617397	So, Jamie brought me a whole bunch of new stuff to add into the normal playlist.
617437	618537	And you get to hear it all tonight.
619338	620158	And, um, yes.
620918	622358	I've got some good news and bad news.
623198	626439	The good news is, I saved lots of money by calling Geico.
628539	629660	What the fuck is that?
629700	630180	You're an idiot.
630200	630660	Shut up.
631420	631480	Um...
633902	637324	So, yeah, we're going to have a whole bunch of new stuff in rotation of Monty Music and more.
637764	639585	Bad news is, and this is the weird thing.
640265	640905	Yeah, I know it's gone.
641085	641926	I drank all my Propel.
641946	642326	I'm sorry.
643046	644867	This is the interesting part.
645347	648829	They're capping how many live listeners we can have at once.
649810	652831	So, it's capped right now.
652931	654212	Yeah, they're going to cap our listeners.
655692	660375	It's capped right now when we're live at a number which we've only hit during one show ever.
660735	660935	What?
661462	664926	Well, I don't want to say on air, but it's that many times this many.
667776	669757	So we've only ever hit that number once.
670157	680442	So what's going to happen is if we ever hit that number again, what's going to happen when you try to connect to the station where we're live, it's going to go, we're sorry, but this station is too popular and you have to be a preferred member.
680842	682562	We're sorry, but you have SARS.
682923	683363	Don't worry.
683503	686324	If you get that message, we're going to be aware of it that we've hit our cap.
686744	689205	And what we'll do for the next week, we'll increase our cap.
689225	692707	We just don't want to have to pay any more money unless we have to, but we don't want our listeners to pay.
693147	694147	We're cheap bitches.
694167	694688	That's right.
695008	696048	But we take donations.
696608	697929	You can send us via PayPal.
699209	705532	Now, here's the next question is that they go, well, if you don't like all of my 365 rules, why don't you go through Shoutcast?
705552	707032	Because Shoutcast is the suck.
707252	709313	Well, it's not necessarily that Shoutcast sucks.
709513	711994	I mean, for talk radio, it's actually pretty good.
712014	714015	But, this is the problem.
714055	715035	This is the sucky part.
715296	715936	We play music.
716756	719238	and the music part, you get into that whole licensing thing.
719278	723982	Now you could get into like, oh, well, you know, you're doing Konami a favor here, blah, blah, blah.
725182	726203	I don't think Konami cares.
727404	732708	I don't think Konami cares the station exists either, but let's just not take chances, especially because we bring you a lot of dance media stuff.
732988	738772	The other thing being is that if we ran a ShotKast server, all the bandwidth would have to come off our personal line here at the house.
739253	744777	I'm sorry, but I'm too busy downloading porn to run a radio station off the computers here.
745322	746924	I'm too busy downloading Transformers.
747364	749226	We hope you have a summer to remember.
763877	766840	Now let's have an update on our... I'm reading your apartment thing.
766860	768321	Oh my god, our apartment is so lame.
768361	769182	I'm going to read this.
769662	770743	You're going to read the apartment thing?
770763	771884	Make a splash this summer.
772264	778870	Whether your idea of fun is heading out to the ballpark, lounging by the pool, or watching a spectacular sunset, we hope you have a summer to remember.
779191	779751	Enjoy!
781092	783975	They also have a list down there where you can sign up to watch rattlesnakes.
784755	785476	I kid you not.
786397	786977	What?
786997	788218	You're just going to watch them rattle?
788439	789039	What would they do?
790400	790961	Can you eat them?
792546	793667	Let's see here.
794008	813382	Um, yeah, we've got... Sign up in the fitness room for tennis, singles, doubles, Friday night, round robin, walking, running, biking, swimming, weightlifting, slash yoga, canoeing, slash kayaking, slash hang gliding, cards, slash computer games, rattlesnake watching.
813562	815684	Seriously, have we left anything out?
817062	817923	Dude, hang gliding.
817963	819464	I can pretend like I'm in Pilotwings.
819945	822106	But I really, really suck in Pilotwings.
822186	827331	But, but, yeah, they don't have, like, rifle shooting.
828612	829333	Skeet shooting.
829353	830574	Skeet shooting.
830794	833776	Does anybody remember that movie, Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead?
833997	834117	Yes.
834137	835558	The dishes are done, man.
835598	836899	They're done, man.
837099	838040	That was the best.
838120	839381	I'm sorry, that movie was the shit.
839401	840222	I don't know why I'm thinking about that.
840242	843445	I just feel like when she shot the guy in the pants with the water gun, it looked like he pissed himself.
844750	847933	I think I'm thinking of that movie today because I saw Christina Applegate in the commercial.
849434	852597	Anyway, so now we had our update with what's going on live 365.
852637	853718	Let's get our update with the host.
853898	854558	Jamie, how was your week?
855459	856180	It was a week.
856720	857461	I worked.
858822	860804	I'm happily getting some overtime now.
861144	861424	Good.
861985	862625	I'm happy.
863446	864367	Anything Mamani related?
865968	867369	I suck at 2DX now.
868050	868731	Why do you suck at 2DX?
868751	871353	Because I'm like a month out of serious practice.
873175	874596	and I hurt my foot on DDR.
875456	877357	Was that using the pad that I have?
878237	879498	That was playing at the arcade.
879778	880478	It was my butt foot.
880718	883700	Since then, like, my left foot's been swollen and it hasn't fit in my shoe.
884620	886281	Have you been playing with my new dance pad?
886461	888262	And I use the term my new dance pad.
888682	889122	Not yet.
889182	889602	Yeah.
890002	891883	Hey, over 30 days.
891943	892444	It's legal.
893464	895085	There's a whole lot of other drama going on there.
895105	895705	We don't get into it.
899764	899904	Oh, cry.
899964	900124	I know.
900144	901265	I think I'd have that on VHS anyway.
929261	930962	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
959400	960580	Some joke that was.
961641	962421	Come on, let me tell them.
962681	963641	Pretend it was funny.
963861	965201	Can you pretend it was funny for me?
965821	968482	It was the most hilarious thing I've ever experienced, ever!
970022	970503	That's right.
971183	973203	Orange Lounge practical jokes and bloopers.
973263	974163	Okay, this is what happened.
975304	979725	Loki made a brand new remix, and we're going to premiere it for you guys probably during the next break, right?
979765	980045	Yes?
980105	980825	Sound good to me?
981025	981225	Yes.
981385	982365	So we'll introduce that.
982585	985086	Well, I guess I have to tell you what it is in order to...
986089	987070	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1002634	1020947	What happened is that Loki left, he went somewhere, he went to go over to his girlfriend's or something, and he left IRC in Orange Lounge up, and I kind of was just like looking, because sometimes I do that, you know, I'll see, oh, is there anybody talking in Orange Lounge right now, should I set myself back from away and join in the chat or whatever, and I saw that Loki had said, hey, I finished this new mix, da-da-da-da-da.
1021730	1025353	And Brad and Irene were over here, you know, Rice, Princess, and LankyStyle were over here.
1025894	1029297	And of course, like Brad, being a big Loki fanboy, was like, oh, I gotta hear that remix.
1029337	1034841	I'm like, okay, well now that Loki and I live together, let me just get on the network and access Loki's computer and find it.
1035082	1036703	Because I know where he keeps all his remixes.
1037063	1038164	So I went in there and played it.
1038264	1040947	I'm like, and that's when I found out, okay, it's Rob Zombie, it's Gravity.
1041647	1043349	So I'm getting to a point here, trust me.
1043769	1043929	So...
1044810	1053152	When Loki finally gets home, he walks through the door and I get him, I'm like, oh my god, Burmani style, they're having a new remix contest, and I heard the most awesome entry.
1053512	1057993	It's like, somebody mixed Gravity with Rom Zombie, and it's called the Twin Burnination Mix.
1060534	1062974	Loki was not of the amused, but I was.
1065115	1068256	The joke fell on his face before I stepped in the door.
1068636	1073557	It was just like, guess what, I heard this new remix, right away I knew what was going on.
1076480	1082062	I was hoping that Loki would be too silly to realize that, you know, oh, he might have gone on my computer and did it.
1082282	1083882	But see, Loki knows I'm a big old snoop.
1083942	1086483	Like, no, I wouldn't look at anything else, just his remixes.
1086783	1088623	He wouldn't share anything else on his computer, I'm sure.
1090124	1090704	Oh yeah, I'm porn.
1090744	1092304	You do have your porn shared, right?
1093765	1095845	Um, no, it's not shared, sorry.
1097346	1097906	Poor Rob.
1098442	1099203	You're so mean to me.
1099623	1099903	All right.
1100683	1101024	Okay.
1101084	1101944	Heteroporn.
1102284	1102945	Heteroporn.
1102965	1104206	You wouldn't be interested in that.
1104366	1104986	They're funny.
1105366	1106567	True or false.
1106627	1107988	There is dick in heteroporn.
1108829	1109949	Some heteroporn.
1111691	1112011	Thank you.
1112911	1117094	And where did the, what was that?
1117714	1118435	Ellie McFeel.
1120029	1120890	What about Adam McFeel?
1122371	1123712	That was funny.
1123972	1127575	Rice Princess and Lanky Style are getting through a friend at Rocky Horror.
1127595	1128816	They've been getting all these pornos.
1128876	1130677	Ally McFeel, Horror of the Rings.
1130757	1134961	You know Q. You know Q. Q, the guy that looks like Striker's son from X2.
1135201	1140225	I saw the DVD exchange hands after the pate thing.
1140965	1141806	Did you see X2?
1142647	1142967	Yes.
1143067	1144108	You remember Striker's son?
1144568	1144748	Yeah.
1144828	1145069	That's Q.
1150660	1150980	Oh my god!
1151020	1151581	Sure No?
1170718	1172600	The Dark Sakura Burnination Mix
1204839	1205921	Oh, this is bad.
1206081	1206602	Here is justice.
1206642	1207403	Here is punishment.
1207423	1208184	This is fucked up.
1208224	1208765	This is fucked up.
1234006	1235037	This is fucked up!
1272043	1273044	Oh, this is bad.
1273104	1273624	Oh, this is bad.
1273724	1274205	Oh, this is bad.
1274245	1274865	Oh, this is bad.
1274905	1275886	Oh, this is bad.
1276166	1276786	Oh, this is bad.
1276846	1277387	Oh, this is bad.
1277487	1278047	Oh, this is bad.
1278067	1278968	This is fucked up.
1279188	1279748	Here is justice.
1279788	1280309	Here is punishment.
1280349	1280529	Here.
1280549	1281109	This is fucked up.
1281129	1281550	Here is justice.
1328345	1330350	This is fucked up.
1331032	1331673	Oops, hi.
1332114	1333397	Oops, that was fucked up.
1334059	1335783	Uh, Loki vs. Tack featuring Rob Zombie.
1335864	1336385	Gravity!
1337369	1339931	The DarkSakura Burnination Mix.
1340612	1344375	And let's say hello to our new guest that just arrived during that little song.
1345036	1345276	New?
1345897	1346277	Well, you know.
1346377	1347078	I'm not a noob.
1347098	1347778	You're new tonight.
1348279	1348519	Yeah.
1349160	1349920	It's new!
1350221	1351342	Hello, LankyStyle.
1351362	1353183	Hey, what's up, guy?
1353363	1360590	See, the reason why we played that is I was telling the story about Oracle's practical jokes and bloopers about how I joked with Loki last night and said it wasn't funny at all.
1361010	1361651	But it was funny to me.
1361751	1362091	I laughed.
1362111	1362612	Not last night.
1362632	1363412	The night before, I think.
1363472	1363773	Whatever.
1364333	1364853	It was funny.
1364893	1367114	I thought it was funny because you were so horrible at lying to him.
1367594	1368334	There's no way.
1368934	1376435	As soon as you walked in, you said, Wow, I heard this awesome reading, but if you could see the look on his face, like, Oh, I know what he did.
1376475	1378356	He found the MP3 game.
1378716	1380836	Wow, that's exactly what he said ten minutes ago.
1380956	1381596	Anyway.
1382016	1382136	Oh.
1382576	1383237	Well, see?
1383597	1385717	Good minds think, or great minds think alike, whatever.
1386377	1388478	Say hello also to the Rice Princess.
1388978	1389318	Hello.
1389558	1390158	Hello, how are you?
1391635	1392436	Orange Crush tonight?
1392696	1392876	Yep.
1393076	1393477	Yay.
1393577	1394938	For you and Jamie especially.
1395718	1398840	So she's tailor-made this one for me and Jamie apparently.
1398920	1399261	Yes.
1399441	1400281	This should be good.
1400501	1401502	It's a kick in the ass.
1401602	1402523	This should be very good.
1403103	1404224	So we have that to look forward to.
1405485	1406125	Stay tuned.
1406606	1407126	Let's see.
1408407	1411529	So, Jamie, did you have anything else you wanted to say about your week?
1411569	1413750	I kind of cut you off with my whole blooper story.
1413770	1414191	I'm sorry.
1414691	1414991	Thank you.
1415011	1415692	I'm a bad man.
1416973	1417313	Thank you.
1418333	1418814	Here now?
1419094	1419374	Show?
1419855	1419995	No.
1420015	1420275	Okay.
1420295	1420475	Okay.
1421505	1422106	I have a cookie.
1422126	1423447	You have a cookie, alright.
1423927	1424868	And then my week?
1425368	1425608	Yeah.
1427490	1432434	My week was my last week of indulgence before I'm a good girl.
1433315	1435056	And you're going to be on diet?
1435877	1437938	It's not a diet, it's a lifestyle modification.
1438159	1440000	It's a lifestyle modification, amen.
1440881	1445504	I am cutting down to one, because I found out that working where I do, I cannot give up soda completely.
1446185	1447886	I need caffeine and I need sugar.
1448987	1450929	I'm cutting to one soda a day and it's balls.
1452364	1453545	I drink balls at work.
1453585	1456506	So if you're going to drink soda, why not drink the worst one for you?
1456526	1458226	No, I'll drink one with the worst caffeine.
1459847	1461668	Actually, Jolt would be worse than balls, probably.
1462028	1464449	Much worse.
1464469	1471152	I am exchanging all of my cookies and fun sweet stuff for carrots and broccoli.
1472692	1473133	That's good.
1473953	1475714	And I'm going to not eat chocolate that much.
1475734	1476914	I'm going to have carob.
1477854	1479035	Ew, carob makes you poo.
1479795	1481076	Everything makes me poo, Rob.
1482148	1485011	With my really crappy digestion, I will eat what I can get.
1486372	1487753	This show makes me poo.
1489434	1491056	It obviously makes Rob poo because you're in the bathroom.
1491076	1491817	Oh, there you are.
1492397	1493718	No, I ran to turn on the AC.
1493738	1497401	That's because... No, not applesauce.
1497441	1499603	And that's because Brad and Irene entered the room and it just got too hot in here.
1500104	1500464	I know.
1501285	1502746	It's getting hot in here.
1502766	1504508	There's something rotten here.
1505408	1506950	You better hold your nose.
1509013	1511774	Oh, by the way, I haven't whored out the chat room yet tonight, so I probably should.
1511814	1515877	If you're listening and you want to join in the fun in our chat room, because there's a whole clusterfuck of people there tonight.
1515937	1516957	Hello, chat room.
1518338	1519138	Yeah, fuster cluck.
1520339	1524682	Go to www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on chat.
1525162	1526923	Don't forget about our LiveJournal community, too.
1527083	1528224	Yes, our LiveJournal community.
1528684	1532186	www.livejournal.com slash users slash Orange Lounge.
1532642	1534163	Yes, post there, please.
1534683	1536204	Yeah, we need people to post.
1536644	1541146	Jamie, you need to assign people a topic for this week to post about in Orange Lounge.
1541666	1542387	You know, like an essay.
1542447	1544067	It'll be an essay project.
1544528	1545928	Best Bomani song to fuck to.
1546348	1547909	Best Bomani song to fuck to.
1547969	1551731	So we want to know, in the Orange Lounge Live Journal community, the best Bomani song to fuck to.
1553412	1554212	Diamond Jealousy.
1557354	1557674	Wow.
1559234	1559615	Holick.
1559815	1560235	Well, hell.
1563547	1564748	I saw the worst porn ever two weeks ago.
1564768	1564868	Yes.
1580854	1583695	It was something that, um, that, uh, Jabberwocky had.
1584056	1584456	What's that?
1584536	1587837	We were watching our movie night, and, like, I had to leave before the anime actually started.
1588117	1588618	Uh-huh.
1588638	1592440	There was some, like, really rotten, horrible, like, camcorder porn.
1593020	1593980	And this woman had a wart.
1594000	1598683	It was straight, like, trailer trash hooker or something.
1599283	1600183	It was so bad.
1600203	1605886	And we, like, they showed this, like, shot of, of her area.
1606466	1607767	And there's a big ol' wart.
1608167	1608847	I was like, eww.
1610668	1611469	Did it have a name?
1612930	1613410	The wart?
1614131	1614751	No, the wart.
1614792	1615692	The wart had a name.
1616433	1617994	Bubba.
1618154	1625379	FYI, our ever-faithful Black Lab, our correspondent for the People's Republic of Kansas, Ben, and I'll hope you enter here.
1625760	1625960	TM.
1626020	1626160	Huh?
1626380	1626480	TM.
1626500	1628442	Trademark.
1629102	1629503	Trademark.
1629743	1630023	Sorry.
1630643	1635287	He is posting that in the community right now so that it will not be forgotten.
1635859	1643483	Anyway, while we were talking about porn and Bomani, I thought this would be a good chance for me to ask Loki about his week.
1644744	1645384	Oh, God.
1645964	1646745	What about my week?
1648125	1649006	It was pretty boring.
1650367	1651967	My girlfriend had her 21st birthday.
1652488	1653348	Happy birthday!
1653888	1657070	She was 21 on Wednesday, so she's happy.
1657150	1664294	Well, she could have been happier because also for her birthday she got strep throat, so that kind of sucks.
1664727	1666968	She's still sick, so, yeah.
1667109	1670010	So I guess you guys didn't go dancing or some club or something.
1670030	1671952	Yeah, like we never do that anyways.
1672372	1674693	Go drinking, go to a porn strip club.
1674773	1675534	Oh wait, that's 18.
1676234	1678576	She can't drink anyways because of her disease.
1678956	1679696	Oh yeah, I'm sorry.
1679997	1680297	Anywho.
1680557	1681398	That's no good.
1681798	1685260	But no, we just hung out and stuff and that's all.
1686000	1690363	But yeah, I'm sure the thing Rob is wanting me to talk about.
1690383	1691524	Tell us, Loki, tell us.
1692595	1700320	I believe last week we mentioned that I was going to be getting a certain video coming in over eBay.
1700480	1701380	Coming in.
1701560	1706843	And this video that I have received, and it's funny because we only missed it by one day, too.
1708404	1711006	This video is called Dance Dance Fuck.
1712106	1713007	D.D.F.
1713947	1714848	Eat me raw.
1715148	1716449	It was supposed to be...
1718977	1720038	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
1746806	1749448	Yes, it's DDF 6 Mix, by the way.
1751870	1752231	Was there a 1.5?
1752331	1752991	I don't know.
1753011	1755273	Was that the Chicks with Dicks episode?
1755894	1758716	I have no idea, but we're going to hear a little bit here of DDF.
1759257	1760498	Do you guys want to see?
1760798	1765082	Don't worry, it's children's safe because it's mosaics, like all Japanese porn.
1768865	1769926	Rated R porn.
1770026	1772748	It's like porn that would be on VH1 if they ever had porn.
1773088	1773609	And they wouldn't.
1774392	1776153	It's like Showgirls with the drawn-on bikinis.
1776213	1777334	Okay, here it is, the intro screen.
1780136	1781237	Yeah, the sound should be going through.
1781597	1782978	It's going through the little intros right now.
1782998	1783918	It looks like DNA.
1784939	1785419	Oh, or not.
1788121	1790022	It's from Deep 5 Studios, it looks like.
1790082	1790683	Or is that Deep's?
1791023	1791343	Here it is.
1791703	1792664	Dance, dance, fuck!
1800349	1803711	And here's the star, Wakabayashi Habayashi or something.
1804662	1807165	And there's the biggest pair of camel lips I've ever seen.
1809809	1810690	And there they go.
1811191	1818280	To describe the scene for you guys, it's just some chick in a nightclub wearing a bunch of silver.
1818640	1819521	And rubbing herself.
1819601	1821223	And she's rubbing and feeling herself.
1821824	1822926	And then she's just kind of...
1825297	1826517	And this has nothing to do with DDR.
1826577	1829938	They're not dancing on a DDR pad or anything, it's just... Oh, head.
1830058	1835159	Occasionally on the screen it will flash, DD, DD, Dance Dance Fox 6 Mix.
1835299	1841180	Think back in the early 90s, except it's like, the grind in Japan, on MTV.
1843140	1847661	Well, I think, yeah, Jamie says with fucking, but I think if it was the grind in Japan, there would probably be fucking anyway.
1848281	1849201	Right on there, on TV.
1849961	1851782	Alright, let's give it a head here.
1852362	1852782	Do-do-do-do.
1853914	1855096	It's definitely really any good.
1856077	1856698	It's not funny.
1857600	1858281	Okay, that's funny.
1861205	1863228	Now, the cool thing about Dance Dance Fuck 6, Nick,
1863939	1864359	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
1888656	1898204	Absolutely nothing to do with DDR at all, except for the fact that sometimes on the screen it'll flash the title, Dance Dance Fuck, and they're in a nightclub and they're dressed like nightclubs.
1898384	1900206	They're dressed like Kara chicks without the boots.
1900746	1902367	Okay, I'm gonna go sit over here now.
1902427	1903228	Yeah, that sucks now.
1904169	1905149	I want my socks.
1907031	1907431	Camera 1.
1909093	1910354	What, there's milky angles or something?
1910394	1911915	I don't know, it just says Camera 1.
1912836	1914017	And she's dancing.
1915157	1916819	This music isn't any good, really.
1919053	1921954	Now, Loki, what would you say about putting this in a sim?
1924315	1925356	That'd be hilarious.
1926296	1927977	You know, I should do that for a random video.
1928377	1929758	Can I still enter Tournament 4?
1931478	1931819	You have 4?
1932459	1933139	No, you can't.
1933739	1938662	Oh, but I'll get to Tournament 4 later, because we've got news on that too, but... Yeah.
1938822	1940883	Where can I get the soundtrack for this?
1941343	1943104	Well, it's one song, so... It's pretty good.
1944204	1945224	Oh, oh, we got another song.
1949249	1950129	This could be Tak.
1950309	1950449	No!
1950469	1953970	This sounds like I've got the rage on Sunday nights.
1957051	1963913	And again, it's the same girl in the silver dress who's got like... She's like the slut of the nightclub.
1966734	1969574	Damn, I wish Tourney Mix 4 wasn't closed, because I would so envy this.
1969614	1970775	Look, she has her slutty friends with her.
1970955	1973255	And I'd have this in the background, just a video, too.
1974256	1975196	There's always Tourney Mix 5.
1977205	1979766	coming soon to screen near you.
1980086	1980567	Anyway, yeah.
1980907	1982067	So, dance, dance, fuck.
1982507	1983108	Kind of sucks.
1985589	1986649	She's getting tongue now.
1988250	1991251	That's not... Ew, that's not even slightly erotic.
1991872	1992252	At all.
1992892	1994953	That looks like something out of a sci... Oh, my God!
1994973	1995433	No, no, no.
1995733	1998895	This is a history... I mean, an animal planet or something, it looks like.
1999595	2000695	Discovery Channel.
2001856	2004177	It looks like something out of a bad science fiction movie.
2004817	2006238	It looks like something from Anti-Anime.
2007826	2010028	That guy does not know how to make out at all.
2011129	2012190	He's like, what am I doing here?
2012210	2013952	I don't care.
2014032	2014753	He's riding me.
2016614	2016975	All right.
2017375	2019437	I think we can turn off the bad porn now.
2019497	2019857	Thank you.
2020959	2022060	That was really awful.
2022640	2023161	There it is.
2024061	2025102	You heard it here first.
2025182	2027324	That's ten minutes of my life I'm never getting back.
2027364	2029086	Dance, fuck, six mix.
2030347	2030667	All right.
2031648	2033270	So is that all you want to say about your week?
2034486	2035206	Uh, yeah.
2035787	2038648	I didn't do too much of them and make the remix.
2039968	2040769	What else did I do?
2040949	2041329	I don't know.
2041429	2042849	I didn't do really much of anything.
2044350	2044750	Slap.
2044870	2049272	That's tired.
2049592	2050692	Yeah, that's it.
2052913	2053273	Wow.
2054034	2054394	Okay.
2056095	2057595	Still trying to get the phones working.
2058235	2058856	No, I don't know.
2060236	2060996	Find it eventually.
2063347	2064308	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2080373	2085796	Suddenly Susan's been off the air for a couple years.
2085936	2087516	Okay, well, I don't watch TV, okay?
2087777	2088157	Okay.
2088197	2089417	But he looks dorky now.
2089898	2093679	I mean, he's still, you know, cute, but with his haircut he looks really dorky.
2095380	2096441	Not when he was young and hot.
2097581	2098522	Breakfast Club's cool, though.
2099302	2102664	He looks dorky in a not cool way.
2102704	2105405	Not like Elijah Wood, you know, he's dorky in a cool way, right?
2105725	2109027	LankyStyle, since you ruthlessly took the mic away from Jamie, you want to tell us about your week?
2109713	2110233	My week?
2110474	2111574	Yes, it was a week.
2111895	2112335	Haha.
2112875	2116398	No, I'm just the same old me, you know, unemployed, playing Rhinerox.
2117258	2122442	Um, let me think if anything special happened besides the, you know, thing you found out about today.
2123623	2124243	Um... Tell us about it.
2124643	2125324	You want me to tell you about it?
2125344	2125484	Yeah.
2125944	2131148	Today, I mean, I got an email June 2nd, but it went to my garbage folder, my, my, my
2131530	2144498	Fuckin' junk mail folder for hotmail because they suck and they can't decipher I usually get the enlarge your penis emails like right to my inbox But all the other stuff that's not junk mail goes to my junk folder So I didn't check it until today, which is what, the 8th?
2145719	2158207	Well, I got accepted to be a Final Fantasy XI beta tester And they're sending me my shit, and that's gonna be pretty cool On Windows Yay Yeah, yay, it's cool So if anybody, we can talk about, you know
2159332	2163996	How the game looks to people, if people listening want to hear, you know, might be interested in getting it.
2164216	2164977	Yeah, I'd be curious.
2165737	2168419	So yeah, but I don't know when it's going to get here, so I'll let everybody know.
2168579	2171782	I know Jamie, and did you and your fiancé both apply?
2171982	2174644	Jamie played for the PS2 beta, and I played for the Windows beta.
2174744	2175125	Gotcha.
2175805	2179789	I can play that while I'm playing Ragnarok.
2182010	2182731	Cool!
2182751	2184532	Does anybody else we know sign up to beta test?
2184552	2188075	I've never seen Ragnarok.
2188456	2188936	Beautiful.
2190211	2195055	Irene's saying that she's never going to see me again because I've got Riding Rock and Final Fantasy XI.
2196075	2196636	I don't know about that.
2196656	2198897	Do they have a launch date for Final Fantasy XI on computer yet?
2199278	2200518	No, I don't know.
2200799	2205982	There might be, I just haven't been looking into it because I'm just like, hey, I'm a beta tester, so I get to play it before everybody else.
2206463	2206763	Woo!
2207063	2207824	Well, not everybody else.
2209945	2212427	But anywho, I don't know anybody else who is.
2212487	2214388	I mean, I think it's just me, Jamie, and Dan.
2215409	2216510	Well, that'd be fun.
2216590	2217010	Good luck to you guys.
2217030	2217651	You should apply.
2218231	2219192	It's probably too late now, isn't it?
2219451	2223532	Well, in the emails it's something about July is when the public beta starts.
2224272	2226272	So it's like less than a month of closed beta.
2226352	2226992	That's interesting.
2227312	2228113	Which is kind of weird.
2228533	2230633	So, I mean, you could at least play the public beta in July.
2231413	2231773	Oh, whatever.
2231973	2233054	Yeah, you don't care.
2233094	2234054	You're too popular.
2234074	2236434	No, I'm excited about Final Fantasy XI.
2236454	2238635	I kind of wish it was on GameCube because I don't know why.
2238735	2241015	I just love my GameCube and I want everything to be on it.
2241555	2242115	Go to hell.
2242975	2243635	I'm already there.
2244676	2246076	Listen, do you talk about GameCube?
2246096	2246396	Shut up.
2246914	2247974	My computer, you know what?
2248074	2249754	I just can't play games on my computer.
2249855	2255375	Like, even when I seem to have a top-of-the-line system, games suck to play on my computer.
2255395	2255976	They really do.
2256476	2259196	I can help you out there, but... I know.
2259256	2260696	I know.
2261677	2263937	Next week, by the way, I'm bringing over Slow Caliber 2.
2264677	2265017	Oh, yeah?
2265057	2265357	Cool.
2265417	2266537	I've had it for, like, a month.
2266777	2268278	I saw the demo at Fry's this week.
2269158	2271078	The demo doesn't do the game justice.
2271158	2272138	I have GameCube, of course.
2273939	2274699	I guess... Yeah, we'll link.
2274919	2276079	I guess I'll talk about my week.
2276099	2276139	Um...
2276761	2283646	Navi and I decided to go to Fry's on Monday because I wanted to make a random purchase, so I decided I wanted to buy a GameCube game.
2284287	2290131	And it came down to two games, like we were looking, and we were either going to get Mario Party 4 or Cubivore.
2291112	2297717	And I decided to get Mario Party 4 because I like to be popular, and when I get Mario Party 4, people will come over more and want to play, so I bought it.
2298958	2300159	And that worked for Friday.
2301900	2303502	But Cubivore, actually what happened is...
2304742	2310064	Navi was so obsessed with Cubivore and the idea of it, he went and freaking bought it.
2310664	2313885	And it's actually pretty cool, because you get to eat things.
2314766	2318587	You ruthlessly tear the tails off of little cube snakes and stuff.
2318767	2329311	It's kind of like a mix between Faceball 2000, except everything's cubes and 3D, and EVO, that old SNES game, where you kind of evolve, you eat things, you get experience points, then you can evolve.
2330305	2332327	But everything's still cubes, so it's kind of weird.
2332527	2333627	But it's very interesting.
2333687	2339412	I especially love the screen where you have to go mate, because you have to mate to have offspring to get more limbs, I guess.
2339432	2340633	You know, it's kind of complicated.
2340673	2341213	Well, not really.
2341773	2345276	But it's funny, because it says, like, you attracted five females.
2345676	2346977	And then it says, would you like to mate?
2347037	2347778	Yes or no?
2348218	2352561	The mating scene in Cube of War is, like, the best thing I've seen in any video game in the past year.
2352661	2354503	Would you like to mate?
2354543	2355123	Yes or no?
2355383	2357285	If a guy's playing the game, who's going to answer no?
2358642	2360423	Those are some pretty hot cube chicks.
2360483	2361363	I know, whoa.
2361643	2365024	And then at the end he says, I mated with five females.
2366524	2367585	And I had three kids.
2368165	2369205	Or three of the females had kids.
2369225	2370526	Sounds like an episode of Jerry Springer.
2372006	2373587	Yes, Cube Springer, Jerry Springer.
2375427	2376748	So Rice Princess, how was your week?
2378008	2379668	Oh, sorry.
2379688	2380569	It was as good as always.
2380669	2382829	Oh, I started a diet on Monday, but that's about it.
2383129	2383830	How's your diet going?
2383850	2384790	It's been going pretty good.
2384810	2386070	I think I lost like five pounds.
2386470	2386891	Woohoo!
2386951	2387651	Congratulations.
2387711	2387991	I'll stop.
2395433	2398274	I think I need to go on a lifestyle change.
2398554	2402535	Yeah, it's not a real diet, so to speak, it's a lifestyle change.
2404656	2405677	Okay, that's good.
2407377	2408858	Yeah, and that's about it.
2409538	2410138	Boring old me.
2410719	2414260	Alright, so anybody else have anything they want to say here during the first little bit of show?
2414909	2418590	I've actually been going on a while now, but anybody else have something they want to add to the conversation going on right now?
2420671	2421452	Um, I'm cool.
2421472	2423372	Okay, Jamie.
2423392	2424393	Everyone wants to be like me.
2425393	2427114	Okay, sure, Jamie.
2427194	2427534	Okay.
2428414	2431115	Just kidding.
2432256	2438158	Okay, I think we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to start this break off with a song.
2438198	2438498	What?
2438858	2439078	What?
2441198	2441418	What?
2441478	2441839	I can't hear.
2441879	2442459	Blah, blah, blah.
2442820	2443660	Guitar Freaks.
2443680	2444081	Guitar Freaks.
2444341	2447164	Actually, I wanted to play one more song real fast, and we'll get into some Guitar Freaks stuff.
2447444	2454330	But since this is graduation week for a lot of people, and they're graduating high school and college, I thought I'd play graduation.
2454390	2455111	Isn't that cute?
2455551	2459235	I'll go drill out my ears with an electric drill now.
2459335	2460256	It'll sound better.
2460596	2462818	This is dedicated to the class of 2003.
2463479	2466922	Oh, since we're all ranty, I suppose we should do the FUs of the week next.
2467438	2471539	So why don't you go ahead and send those to me over a private message in the chat room.
2471559	2472319	My name is Sky.
2472899	2475500	And if you aren't in our chat room, get your ass over there.
2475520	2478780	www.callybomondi.com, click on Orange Lounge, click on Chat.
2480801	2481061	Yes?
2481941	2482121	What?
2482501	2482721	Yes.
2482961	2486462	Okay, so, congratulations, and then a couple Guitar Freak songs.
2486502	2488242	So, this is to you, Class of 2003.

2902863	2904505	Can you introduce yourself for our listeners?
2904965	2905805	I'm Miss Cleo.
2906346	2907927	Oh, it's great to have you on the show today.
2908267	2909408	Hello, how are you today?
2909908	2910829	I'm great, thanks.
2911029	2912049	Did you have a question?
2912470	2918353	Well, yes, actually I wanted to know... Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please?
2919494	2924077	Uh, well, no, I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.
2924337	2925198	All right, go ahead.
2925583	2928744	Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?
2929084	2930004	Is he incarcerated?
2930644	2931965	Uh, actually, no, he's not.
2932005	2934245	But what do you think of the ever-ranty DarkSakura?
2934405	2935666	Hi, dear, how are you?
2936246	2936986	I love you.
2937226	2938706	I see you two must know each other.
2938826	2940127	Well, what do you think of Sky?
2940427	2942367	Did he used to play football when he was in high school?
2942587	2944028	Well, actually, no, he didn't.
2945248	2947088	Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?
2947549	2949069	I want you to really remember...
2950144	2953366	I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly.
2953666	2956608	And I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.
2957348	2957748	Right.
2958048	2960950	Okay, well, thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.
2961110	2966153	Um, I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but who are all of these nosy people?
2966393	2969714	Outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card.
2969875	2970815	Get away from me.
2973336	2978099	Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.
2978622	2979442	I'm Miss Cleo.
2979802	2980543	I love you.
2982563	2983203	We are back.
2983683	2985944	You're listening to episode number 47, not 48.
2986084	2987844	Hello.
2988744	2989185	Ha ha.
2989905	2990505	Ha ha ha.
2991245	2993006	We hope you enjoy our cheesy little promos.
2994046	2997187	Uh, Jamie threatened in her live journal today to make some new ones this week.
2997227	2997727	I'm excited.
2998527	2998827	I did?
2998847	3000227	Yeah, you said you wanted to make new promos.
3000247	3000847	Oh, that's right, I did.
3002108	3003088	Hey, go for it, dude.
3004008	3004408	Dudette.
3004688	3004888	Who?
3005889	3006189	Jamie.
3006209	3006569	Oh, her?
3006689	3007029	Okay.
3007778	3009479	I want to make a couple more celebrity interviews, too.
3009499	3011900	I've got to call some people and get more celebrity interviews.
3011920	3013501	Because that was fun, interviewing Miss Cleo.
3014341	3015522	I'd like to try to get some wrestlers.
3016162	3019023	She's... Hey!
3020144	3020864	Oh, yeah!
3021945	3023265	Actually, Brad does a really good impression.
3023285	3024206	I am very sad.
3024586	3024826	Why?
3024886	3025907	Miss Elizabeth is dead.
3026907	3027707	Who's Miss Elizabeth?
3028668	3031409	She was Macho Man's wife, like, in the 80s.
3031869	3033110	I don't follow wrestling.
3038662	3038902	What?
3039142	3039383	What?
3040063	3042084	We're doing wrestling drama.
3042104	3042664	Oh, alright.
3042825	3043105	Alright.
3043145	3043485	Whatever.
3045146	3046447	Shall we get to the FUs of the week?
3047187	3047567	Yeah.
3048008	3049308	Do you want the new song?
3049568	3050329	You want the new one.
3050629	3051049	Alright.
3052190	3052910	Here we go.
3053110	3055572	It is now FU of the week time.
3056112	3058634	And what is this FU of the week thing all about, Jamie?
3059234	3060835	Where we get pissed off and tell you about it.
3077985	3081387	The first one goes toward the stupid bitch that was in front of me driving.
3082528	3088952	She was obviously drunk, and she would... True to the law says you have to stop a full car like behind the person in front of you at a stoplight.
3089412	3090553	But who follows that anyway?
3090593	3091073	That's stupid.
3091594	3096096	And she was stopping, and then she was like driving all twitchy, so I just had to speed around her.
3096116	3096717	She's so stupid.
3097225	3103467	And then her question in the seat next to her was obviously on E. She kept putting her hands in the air and then trying to hug the girl in the front seat.
3104967	3108368	And then, uh, fuck having SARS.
3109208	3111909	The whole beginning of this week I was so sick of my allergies.
3112770	3117171	And thanks to, uh, free gifts from Allegra and Claritin D, I was all better.
3117931	3118731	But yeah, it sucks.
3119151	3121932	I didn't have a voice, but I work in friggin' customer service, so what's up?
3122932	3124553	Um, and then...
3126983	3129904	Another one goes to not having, you know, money and stuff.
3130524	3132124	And my breaks, which grind.
3133565	3136545	And, um, I think that's about it.
3137286	3140686	I'm not really all that angsty that much anymore because my life is sort of happy right now.
3141827	3142867	Aw, that's so cute.
3143727	3144547	Break my ass.
3144627	3145087	Fuck you.
3146788	3147808	See, I can get you, Rani.
3148688	3149389	Okay, that, that.
3149809	3151329	And another one goes to Rob.
3151549	3152289	Yay.
3153169	3154730	And another one goes toward, um,
3155976	3158918	All of these communities I'm a member of, just about, in my live journal.
3160079	3164042	Because I'm, like, taking them, I'm taking them all off, because people just post really stupid stuff.
3164122	3171628	I'm leaving up the DDR and Baymani communities, but, like, you know, it's just been, like, some stupid drama going on.
3171648	3173129	And this other guy, okay, okay, okay.
3173910	3174430	Here's one.
3175151	3181436	Alright, everyone knows about, you know, I go through my fans, you know, crazes and my little phases, and right now it's Transformers for me.
3182757	3182937	What?
3186503	3187144	Okay!
3188124	3188985	No.
3189085	3192728	But I'm on this roleplay board.
3193308	3195770	And there's this guy being... You're on the microphone cord.
3195990	3199033	This guy's just being all godmode-y.
3199113	3201394	I hate godmode RPG players.
3202135	3203496	I hate it.
3203956	3209700	Especially when you're not doing anything with a set combat-based rule, and he's like, oh, I just had me appear there, and you're blah blah blah.
3209901	3212122	I'm like, okay, and where in your profile is this?
3212202	3215145	And then he was like, well, you've been here a month ago, you would've known blah blah blah.
3215165	3215585	I'm like, okay.
3216385	3226710	So he got smacked down by one of the admins on the board, so that made me feel all happy and justified and I couldn't help rubbing his nose in it, so... Did he have an ogre-slaying knife?
3226770	3227410	Maybe that's why.
3228111	3231552	I got an ogre-slaying knife as a plus nine against ogres!
3232253	3234434	You're not even there, you're getting drunk!
3235254	3235894	Okay, no.
3236915	3238056	No, it wasn't that.
3238276	3239476	He was just being stupid.
3240537	3245139	I really, really... And another thing, people who have their live journals...
3246013	3248914	and cannot use paragraphs or complete sentences.
3249534	3252655	Unless you're doing it on purpose, and if that's the case, stop.
3254095	3254435	All right.
3254995	3261497	And some of these people are really, you know, nice people.
3261517	3262417	That's going out over here.
3263098	3264218	Great people that I know.
3264918	3265718	I love you to death.
3266078	3272400	But please, use grammatically correct sentence structure when you post in your live journal.
3273000	3275221	And also for people who put humongous posts,
3275962	3276902	You know, I understand.
3276922	3277482	That's fine.
3277603	3278283	I do it too.
3278863	3280864	But there's such a feature called LJ Cut.
3281004	3282344	It's a really easy code to remember.
3282624	3285285	You can even go onto the FAQ page and cut and paste.
3286125	3286545	Wow!
3287165	3287546	Do it!
3288766	3289306	Okay, I'm done.
3291047	3291347	Wow.
3291787	3292927	I could name names, but I won't.
3292947	3293987	I'll just tell them to their face later.
3294608	3294968	Loki.
3296928	3298069	Sorry for messing with the phone.
3299491	3301013	I forgot to connect this to the soundboard.
3301033	3303455	Yeah, we want to hear your conversation that you're going to have.
3303675	3306097	I was trying to, because I fixed something.
3306138	3307259	I was seeing if it worked.
3307599	3312504	So I was calling my voicemail to see if it would leave a message, because if it left a message, that meant the phones were working.
3312664	3314406	So Matt's first fuck you goes to Brad.
3316167	3318049	No, I'm not that mad this week, actually.
3319430	3320572	First, slight...
3321314	3321794	First F.U.
3321814	3322854	of the Week, not really an F.U.
3322914	3326295	of the Week, kind of like I'm laughing at you because you're stupid, type of thing.
3327195	3336918	I'm gonna laugh at the stupid bitch that I mentioned last week, cause, hi, you're licensed, you have to take a picture, you have to take the stupid veil off, you stupid bastard.
3337398	3340058	Go home, go back to your country, you freaking Al-Qaeda.
3340459	3341639	Anyways, enough.
3342259	3345040	So, um, enough of that, and, um, let's see, what else?
3345920	3346040	Um...
3346912	3351616	FU's stupid phone program not working because I can hear the phone, but I can't talk.
3352357	3357201	I mean, it's kinda cool and all, but I like to talk, and that would be cool.
3358322	3358902	Uh, what else?
3360704	3366869	Um, I don't know, FU for not having that many good, you know, files coming out lately, friggin' sim files.
3367730	3370673	Um, also the fact that Terrible Mr. Grinshaw was out today.
3371233	3373715	Oh yeah, Terrible Mr. Grinshaw came out today, yay.
3374376	3374456	Um...
3375788	3382350	Also, all these phone programs that are for making phone calls on your PC that claim to be free, but they're not.
3383151	3383551	I hate that.
3383611	3388392	Why even say they're free if you're not going to make them free if you have to pay money to use the phone for free?
3388512	3397275	I don't know, I'm not that smart and all, but paying money to use a phone for free is just paying to use the phone.
3397856	3403398	It's like saying, well, you're paying the 35 cents to use the payphone as a right to use the phone for free.
3404158	3404758	Makes no sense.
3405647	3407468	Um, let's see.
3408269	3409029	That's it.
3409169	3413212	I really didn't have anything because I've been kind of like busy with other stuff.
3413732	3415754	Um, yeah, I just really haven't been paying attention.
3422778	3426721	Um, my FU of the week goes to exes that screw your friend in the shower.
3426821	3427301	That's it.
3430603	3431724	Short symbol to the point.
3434085	3434806	Brad, anything?
3438100	3438940	Sorry about that, Rob.
3439060	3439680	That's alright.
3439920	3440360	It happens.
3442200	3443121	No hard feelings there.
3443161	3445201	He just didn't fall into the penis.
3446541	3447361	Let's not drag it out.
3447401	3449242	His hand landed there.
3451902	3452702	Twenty times.
3454603	3455103	Up and down.
3456363	3457583	Okay.
3458344	3464385	I'm glad Loki brought that up about the crazy lady who won't take her veil off, because I wanted to expound on that.
3464405	3465045	That's a word, right?
3465481	3472244	I don't know if people know, but in this country, especially in California, just anywhere in the country, in America, driving, having a driver's license, is a privilege, not a right.
3483530	3510862	You don't have the right to have a driver's license, it's something you have to strive to get, you know, you have to go do it, and it's just a privilege, so, if you're not, you know, you can't fucking sue, I don't know if they are suing, but I would be surprised if they're trying to sue the country for not letting her have her fucking license picture taken, or having her license, but you can't do that, because it's not your right, we're not infringing on your rights as an American, or as a legal alien, or as an alien, because it's not your right to have a license!
3511402	3512963	Fucking follow the rules!
3513775	3514275	Retard.
3514636	3515436	Oh, and another thing.
3516036	3522520	All these people who are crossing the border from Mexico and stuff, who are getting killed because they're breaking the law.
3522860	3524281	No, I'm not racist, I'm just saying.
3524781	3529484	We have a law that says you can't try to, you know, you have to come in an illegal way.
3529544	3531565	If you do it illegally, you're a criminal.
3531865	3537328	And if you are a criminal by doing it illegally and you get hurt doing it, you can't sue our country, which has been happening.
3537628	3541170	Because you're a freaking criminal in the first place for breaking an American law.
3541190	3542551	Well, it's actually a true...
3543120	3545082	Some sort of international law or something, I don't know.
3545843	3547464	I'm, urgh, anger.
3547584	3548785	Okay, what did you just say, Matt?
3549786	3551328	Uh, MTV Music Awards are on.
3551508	3552489	Okay, anyways, um, no.
3553009	3556633	My FB of the Week, actually, I forgot, is for stupid movie sequels.
3557473	3561737	For God's sake, stop making stupid... I'm kidding!
3563731	3564993	Stop it, Brad gets his ink.
3566934	3568816	Like, for instance, Legally Blonde 2.
3569257	3571679	I didn't want to watch Legally Blonde 1.
3571739	3572940	I don't want to see a sequel of it.
3573080	3574601	They're talking about making it Back to the Future 4.
3575615	3581498	They ended it fine, and now they're making it Back to the Future 4.
3581858	3587081	Not only will the two directors not be back for it, but Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox will not be in it.
3587501	3588962	And it might be animated.
3589002	3592844	I was going to say, does he go back in time when he didn't have Parkinson's disease or whatever?
3595555	3599876	I'm supposed to go back to 1985, but my hand is shaking so much that I went to 485.
3600336	3602457	Oh, the hijinks that ensue.
3602657	3604237	Oh my god.
3604858	3606738	It's wacky fun for the family.
3607038	3608479	You said hijinks, that's funny.
3614460	3616821	Yeah, he wouldn't be so good at that gun game anymore.
3617361	3617981	Yeah.
3618081	3618321	Anyway.
3618361	3619202	Ah, yeah, I'm done.
3625518	3628781	Wouldn't a superhero movie with Christopher Reeve and Michael J. Fox be great?
3631383	3633845	It would be the Avengers of Handyman and the Tiny Avenger.
3635246	3635627	All right.
3638709	3639070	Let's see.
3639150	3641912	Rice Princess, do you have anything you'd like to F you today?
3642492	3645175	Well, you see, I'm kind of pissed off.
3645195	3645335	Sorry.
3645635	3649698	Well, you see, I'm kind of... No, I'm kidding.
3649859	3650179	I'm kidding.
3651878	3654360	I don't really have anything that I'm pissed off about.
3654400	3655881	Can I do a love you of the week?
3656842	3657983	Yeah, you can do a love you of the week.
3658023	3658964	Do we have love yous of the week?
3658984	3659224	Yeah, sure.
3659244	3659404	Why not?
3659664	3664428	I give my love you to Rob because he bought me that Dog of Glee notebook and it was so cute.
3664488	3665609	Thank you so much.
3665689	3666450	It was so great.
3667751	3669433	Oh, it's the movie awards or whatever?
3669453	3673076	They're parading the Matrix here at the movie awards.
3673856	3675498	And a love you to Brad because he's cool.
3675658	3675938	Okay.
3677680	3677780	Aww.
3678385	3678965	I love you too.
3679205	3679966	This is really weird.
3680226	3682526	And they have Wanda Sykes as the oracle, that's great.
3682546	3686748	Matt turned on this TV, it's the MTV Awards, Matrix thing.
3688268	3696391	Justin Timberlake is some sort of like... I wanted to see this, for the movie awards this year, they did a parody of the Matrix Reloaded, and I really wanted to see this.
3696571	3700953	I'm sorry that I've broken the FUs, I'm sure people can go ahead and, uh, yeah.
3701353	3701693	Wait.
3701733	3703053	Let's continue on with the FUs.
3704414	3706254	FU to the MTV Movie Awards, call a sham.
3706475	3707715	Justin Timberlake's dancing.
3708550	3709991	Like, he's doing the Matrix stuff.
3710091	3710611	He's dancing.
3712012	3714233	Alright, uh, let's go to the chatroom FUs.
3714293	3716194	Are you done with your, uh, love use, Irene?
3716254	3716574	Okay.
3717295	3718776	Let's go to the chatroom FUs, shall we?
3722858	3728221	Puppy would like to say, or Black Lab, I should say, would like to say, fuck the ants that invaded my bathroom.
3728281	3735625	Fuck every single Kazaa WinMX user in my dorm for hogging all the bandwidth, even at 3 AM, and making my games play like shit online.
3736158	3740041	Fuck my ex-roommate for leaving a pile of garbage outside the window of the suite's living room.
3740401	3742402	Now I have to clean it up because this lazy ass won't.
3742983	3743683	Fuck finals.
3744264	3746085	Fuck you for not setting the webcam up.
3746345	3747086	Hey, fuck you, buddy.
3750028	3753130	Mulheimer would like to say fuck the Matrix for ending out of nowhere.
3754231	3756692	I don't feel like waiting until November because it was so good.
3756773	3763017	Fuck the Six Flags near me because they had to get rid of their four extremes because some bitch complained about the word bitch in it.
3764702	3767503	Okay, nobody even heard that at all.
3768323	3775564	I'm sorry, we're kind of sidetracked by watching Sean William Scott playing Agent Smith.
3776004	3778985	I want to come back to that later and make a little topic out of that.
3779005	3779845	That was interesting.
3781505	3784646	This is really stupid.
3784726	3785506	Okay, anyway, hi.
3786386	3790207	Fuck exams this week, and I don't normally say this because there is a reasoning for exams.
3790526	3793769	But everyone is running around like chickens without dicks trying to remember everything.
3794029	3795811	And it's really annoying, so fuck them.
3799414	3800375	Sharkskrl!
3800896	3801496	Sharkskrl!
3801897	3804619	Sharkskrl would like to say F you to everything!
3805540	3806121	Everything!
3806201	3808123	I want everything's balls to die.
3808623	3809104	That is all.
3810165	3811406	Not my balls, please.
3811946	3812647	I wanna keep mine.
3816033	3822820	Dark Tetsuya would like to say, I have no FUs actually, just the happy news about the female that has contacted me over the past week.
3823320	3824802	Aw, you can go sit in Irene's corner.
3827965	3829927	Well, if you were listening to me, you'd know, so yeah.
3830928	3834211	Ninst would like to say, just one this week, but it seems to be constant.
3834732	3836173	FU'd my dial-up connection.
3837354	3838876	Sorry bud, wish there was more we could do for you.
3841198	3847261	John Fields would like to say F you to IBM for making a floppy disk type called XDF that Windows can't read.
3847281	3847741	What?
3848162	3851343	F you to having to move into a condo because of a divorce.
3851964	3852224	Ouch.
3853084	3855465	F you to the pains of cleaning out a house.
3855545	3859547	And lastly, huge F you to Dell because my 19-inch CRT died.
3859587	3862769	And not only that, but so did my DVD plus RW drive.
3862809	3864330	It won't burn DVD-R anymore.
3864690	3867051	Oh, sure, RW works fine, but R is much cheaper.
3867651	3868532	F you, Dell.
3869164	3872585	You better fix this stuff for free because of my warranty when I call you tomorrow.
3874145	3875126	It says, oh, after that.
3875166	3876266	I think he meant to type or else.
3876726	3878006	Dude, you're getting a broken Dell.
3882328	3883288	Dude, you're getting a dump.
3885148	3885408	Anyway.
3886569	3888909	F you to summer school, says Nico Adachi.
3889990	3891590	That would suck if you have to go to summer school.
3891610	3892010	I'm sorry.
3893671	3898492	AkumaGM would like to say F you to my infernal MP3 player that decided to go on the blink.
3898993	3901974	You used to work so well until you started to skip for no reason.
3902474	3903814	Did you set MP3 player?
3903954	3904874	I stab at thee.
3906215	3907435	Why get an MP3 player anyway?
3907515	3910236	I should get a CD player that can read MP3 on the CD.
3910296	3911596	You know, I don't read mines.
3914236	3915077	I would just like to share.
3916877	3919978	Alright, moving right along, we have the 23rd Magus' FUs.
3921898	3923278	FU to graduation rehearsal.
3923358	3925659	Four hours stuck in the football field in the hot sun.
3926058	3930503	Just because 200 fucking seniors can't walk and step, it's Johnson, so they have to pimp strut.
3931004	3932746	Sub-sunburnination.
3933767	3934387	That's a new word.
3935008	3939853	F you to me for being such a damn glutton and ordering the biggest sundae they have at Leather Bees in celebration.
3940254	3940554	Burps.
3941075	3942296	F you to summer visitation.
3942416	3944258	I don't want to go to Kentucky, goddammit.
3944759	3946501	Looks for lawyers, damned if they are.
3950424	3955147	DDR Angel would like to say, F you to the egotistical bitch co-worker for making me work for her tomorrow.
3955547	3956728	Oh wait, more money for me.
3957388	3961430	Well, still, F you to her for being an egotistical seniority-slinging bitch that she is.
3961470	3962191	Yeah, okay, I'm done.
3965472	3970575	DJ Tyrant would like to say, I have not gotten your F yous of the week.
3970655	3971956	Send them to me over a private message.
3975158	3978640	So... Well, sorry...
3981243	3985906	So, anyway, I'm doing the show by myself right now, apparently, because the others have more important things to watch.
3987047	3989128	So... Oh, Rob, I'm listening.
3990549	3992791	I'm adding to the show, I think.
3995132	3995873	Oh, that was funny.
3997894	3998254	I'm kidding.
3999235	4000496	Hey, Rob, I think we should go to a break.
4001477	4002137	No, that's okay.
4002317	4004919	I'm still waiting for one more FU to come in.
4005299	4008121	A world of pain all over your candy ass!
4008742	4009302	Here it goes!
4010117	4011017	Vis-a-vis!
4011317	4012257	Concordantly!
4015578	4016078	Justin.
4016558	4016838	Yeah.
4017198	4018098	I apologize.
4020379	4020699	Yeah.
4022719	4024159	I'd like to say an F you to MTV.
4025280	4026540	Just because they suck anyway.
4026880	4028420	Well, Matt turned it on in the first place.
4028500	4028880	Yeah, I know.
4028960	4033461	F you to Matt.
4034761	4039322	Alright, so... I guess I'll get to that one missing F you later.
4040151	4041953	In the meantime, I guess I ought to go to break.
4043475	4044816	Because I don't feel like doing a show myself.
4047079	4051564	So we'll be back after this potpourri of Bomani music.
4052465	4053507	Enjoy, boys and girls.
4085959	4115037	There's Bright Light starring Noco Flo A kung fu fighter in a disco He's out to take his chance, he knows the hundreds in the house Only go for romance He's got a white suit on, five past one and the night has just begun Cause when he lays it on with style, a lady's man with a nice smile And right before his eyes, sees a pretty young thing looking real fly He wants to make the score, so he takes a hand and leads her to the dance floor He's giving her line after line, she tells him that he looks real fine
4117672	4118596	Like what he's come for, buy it
4171937	4172620	Thanks for watching!
4233658	4234399	Thanks for watching!
4391946	4396028	I feel, I feel You are the only one that can feel this way I feel, I feel
4433755	4436996	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.
4437576	4439296	Orange Lounge Radio.
4441797	4442237	We are back.
4442757	4444198	And you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
4445238	4447118	And Brad's splashing me liquor.
4447178	4448239	He wants me to start drinking.
4448279	4452039	You know, I already got pretty toasty last night.
4452079	4453440	I don't know if I need to get drunk again.
4453880	4454320	We'll see.
4456501	4456821	I don't know.
4459841	4460161	I don't know.
4460181	4460561	I can have one.
4463345	4464266	I'm not going to go outside.
4464466	4465627	You know what, Brad, bring me one.
4465907	4466808	I can have one.
4467528	4468849	One will loosen me up a little bit.
4469350	4470250	One or two or ten.
4471731	4473153	Usually with Rob, one leads to two.
4473253	4474714	Actually, can I take one home with me?
4476495	4477936	Don't carry an open container in the car.
4478697	4479798	Yeah, you can take one home with you.
4482760	4484821	I don't want to drink something before I'm driving.
4485942	4486643	I'm responsible.
4493795	4495756	Don't drink and do radio, kids.
4498977	4499677	I'm not underage.
4499717	4501858	If you're underage, you must have your parents' permission to drink.
4502518	4505420	Although people at restaurants seem to think that I'm like 18.
4506480	4506820	I don't look 18.
4506940	4512202	Have you ever been carded in an R-rated movie?
4512882	4513103	Yes.
4513143	4514303	That shit would piss me off.
4515584	4518885	How did you... You look like... Oh!
4519305	4519505	What?
4519705	4519865	Oh!
4519885	4521106	I have good news.
4521126	4521746	Uh-oh.
4522751	4525693	This is more centered toward Loki.
4526353	4527734	Remember when we went to see The Matrix?
4528514	4530335	And remember that crap with the thing and the credits?
4531436	4531976	Guess what?
4532597	4538740	I got six bucks from the movie theater and a $2 off coupon.
4538840	4540041	How'd you get six bucks?
4541022	4543163	I gave them my ticket and told them what happened.
4545144	4545724	You should do that.
4545764	4546245	You'll get money.
4550003	4552685	They turned on the lights and ended the movie.
4555046	4557287	And then they turned it back on, but didn't really turn the lights off.
4558488	4561270	You mean like before the trailer came on?
4561290	4562510	Like during the credits or the end?
4563111	4563331	Right.
4563391	4566052	So when Mar and John was in town, we went to see X-Men 2.
4567113	4572596	And so I was just thinking, you know, so I have that ticket, and I personally wonder if they would, you know, give me like a movie pass or something.
4573036	4577579	So I went and told them about it, and they gave me money off of another movie ticket, and then they gave me money.
4578439	4578680	Cool.
4579120	4579380	I'm like...
4579801	4581542	Okay, she should totally take your ticket there.
4582463	4585064	It's like we never saw the movie because they never tore our tickets.
4585785	4594730	Yeah, we just walked right by them because we got there, like, I guess there was this, what happened was we were thinking, I was thinking of getting a Fandango ticket the night before, you know, buying them online.
4595290	4602274	But I was like, you know what, maybe they'll be, I don't know, I don't want to wait in line, you know, a huge line if a bunch of people bought Fandango tickets or whatever.
4602715	4605076	Because then you have to wait on a Fandango ticket line or whatever, you know.
4605512	4609936	So I just went there early, and there had to be two other showings happening before that weren't posed the night before.
4610336	4614539	So we got these two showings that nobody had tickets for, because everybody bought Fandango tickets.
4615160	4621445	And so we went in there, and there was no, what do you call them, the person who, the chauffeur, taking the tickets.
4621805	4627090	So we just walked in there, we could've, like, I don't know, probably gone and seen another movie, or, Usher, that's what he calls him.
4627670	4628931	Gottman's chauffeur.
4629992	4632414	Yeah, thanks James, or Jeeves, or whatever.
4633444	4642312	So I don't know, we probably could have sold the tickets, I don't know.
4642512	4643933	Aw, Loki gets a present.
4643953	4647156	You can't use it for like a new movie, but any movie that's already out.
4648877	4651059	But it's a 2, or a 1 car.
4651159	4652721	I don't hardly go to movies anymore, so.
4652801	4655823	Anyway, um...
4659494	4665176	Moving right along, did we want to get into Cage Match or does anybody else have something they want to say?
4665296	4666256	Do you not have a song still?
4666276	4667637	Because your song's first, buddy.
4670257	4671558	Uh, no, I don't have anything yet.
4671618	4673458	I thought you had the vinyl you wanted to do.
4674699	4675039	I did?
4676899	4678960	Uh... Oh, yeah.
4679600	4680080	Can you do that?
4680541	4681001	Yeah, I'll do that.
4681381	4681681	Alright.
4682121	4683842	You're up first, bud, so get that vinyl out.
4685462	4686082	Alright.
4686783	4687983	You know they have it in Ragnarok?
4688615	4689395	What do they have in Ragnarok?
4689415	4689936	The Pooh hat.
4690976	4693937	I found the stop sign hat today, someone was selling one.
4694657	4697939	You walk around with a stop sign on your head, and then there's a mask that makes you gothy.
4698359	4701780	I like the pretend murder, it's a giant knife in your head.
4702481	4703561	You walk around with a knife in your head.
4704081	4706562	And there's one that's an apple with an arrow in your head, so you can be arrowed.
4708723	4709784	But I want Imperium.
4713165	4713505	Not really.
4713885	4714365	I fell in for 625,000.
4716926	4720829	But I want Empyrean so I can start a guild and call it I Kick Your Ass Guild.
4721609	4723210	Or like Battle Royale, which is my party's name.
4726552	4727813	Okay, we ready for Cage Match?
4728253	4728554	Mm-hmm.
4728854	4729154	Alright.
4730035	4743103	Last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match, for the fourth week, Loki's pick from the Matrix Reloaded soundtrack, Mona Lisa Overdrive, won... They all know how it goes.
4743463	4744024	...once again...
4744966	4747387	So here it is, one last time, a little piece of it.
4748067	4748847	Mona Lisa Overdrive.
4748867	4749908	Because guess what, kids?
4749968	4754029	When this song is in rotation four weeks, it is retired.
4754189	4755849	We're like TRL up in this shit.
4756189	4760171	So, here's a little clip of Mona Lisa Overdrive, and it's retirement.
4761251	4762731	And now, the winning song.
4765072	4766193	I'm gonna skip her out, sorry.
4773735	4774015	Yay.
4776454	4777495	That's it, it's gone.
4778416	4782939	So, alright, that was Mona Lisa Overdrive and it's out.
4783080	4790245	So, all three of us have brand new picks this week because Mona Lisa Overdrive may no longer participate.
4790305	4792888	Do you need a little more time, Loki, because I have some late FUs I can read.
4795950	4798292	Loki needs a little more time, so I'm going to read some late FUs.
4798772	4799213	Oh, you're good?
4799373	4801435	Well, I need to do these anyway, so I'm going to read some late FUs.
4801995	4805338	So, late FUs, shame on you for being late.
4806880	4807200	All right.
4807220	4809381	I have way too much fun with those sound clips.
4809801	4810901	Okay.
4811822	4812462	Late FUs.
4812542	4813062	From Nintz.
4813682	4816643	FU to my connection because I didn't get to hear my first FU.
4816803	4819204	Because I take my socks off a lot.
4819264	4819544	Anyway.
4820945	4821325	All right.
4832057	4836899	DJ Tyron would like to say, F you to my ISP, I have to go through a proxy server to access the chatroom.
4836959	4838520	ISPs are dumb that block sites.
4839100	4840461	F you to not having broadband.
4840921	4844343	I'm actually sad now that I'm leaving high school, so F you to heading out to real life.
4844403	4847985	It's been great hanging out with all you great people, but now we're going to go our separate ways.
4848986	4849146	Aww.
4850847	4855549	F you to the people at the LAN party yesterday who just wanted to play the fastest map possible on StarCraft.
4855569	4856090	You're dumb.
4856130	4859291	Stop using noobs maps and try to beat me because you don't know how to play a strategy game.
4859311	4860512	And F you to them at Counter-Strike.
4861038	4863439	Just using the AWP shows you have no skill.
4863859	4867300	Girls, please, I'm begging you, will you please stop ignoring me when I talk to you, please?
4868600	4869580	Don't talk to me when I'm doing FBs.
4869620	4870180	I'm done now.
4870200	4870940	Give me a jewel case.
4871381	4872081	You want a jewel case?
4872621	4874021	Or a sleeve or something.
4875302	4876582	Like a big one or a little one?
4878022	4879963	I don't know where one is over here, you guys.
4881263	4882003	How about here?
4885704	4886044	Alright.
4886764	4888685	So, back to the cage match.
4891638	4892438	I love that sound effect.
4892799	4893139	All right.
4896140	4900162	This week in the Orange Launch Cage match, now that Mona Lisa Overdrive has been retired, Loki's up first.
4900222	4901603	Loki, tell us about your pick.
4901843	4902523	This should be great.
4904504	4907546	This is from our girlfriend, because she loves Donna Summers.
4908046	4916530	And it's the song... I would say that Donna Summers is like... Well, obviously, she'd be like the erotic, but... You know, like the 70s and 70s age...
4917907	4920608	Anyway, this song is Love to Love You Baby.
4921228	4924009	I believe it's been featured in a few movies and stuff.
4925249	4931011	It's also one of my stronger picks because, you know, I gotta give the other people some chance, you know, so here we go.
4931952	4932692	Love to Love You Baby.
4934712	4936453	Alright, here it is, Love to Love You Baby.
4944222	4968348	I love to love you, baby I love to love you, baby I love to love you, baby I love to love you, baby I love to love you, baby When you're laying so close to me There's no place around that you're believing in me Yeah
4987643	4988825	Thanks for watching!
5020607	5021489	Thank you for watching!
5125837	5127257	Wacka Wacka Baby Baby
5155433	5156395	Thank you for watching!
5178484	5178864	Yay!
5179685	5180865	Okay, then.
5181465	5182246	Yay, it's over.
5182506	5183567	That was the first pick.
5183627	5185447	Donna Summer would love to love you, baby.
5185968	5188649	Wow, let's go around and get the room's thoughts on that.
5188909	5189709	Yay, it's over.
5189729	5191790	DarkSakura, what did you think of that one?
5192271	5193191	I liked Donna Summer.
5193651	5200795	Like, she did, you know, a good version of MacArthur Park, which was later parodied into Jurassic Park.
5202396	5207198	And she did Bad Girls.
5207694	5208054	Do you remember?
5208114	5208795	She did that, girls.
5208835	5209375	Second mix.
5209775	5210075	Yeah.
5211076	5213478	Well, her version wasn't in the second mix, but she did that.
5213498	5214959	But anyway.
5215199	5218361	But that song, you can't disco to it, okay?
5218901	5223684	It's only, and it's too slow to get like a good, you know, you know... It is bump to.
5223704	5224284	Sex music.
5224604	5225165	Hold on.
5225205	5227826	Did you not notice the moaning in the background?
5227947	5230068	But that would not be any good for sex either.
5230588	5231269	It's too slow.
5233250	5233810	Studio 54 music.
5233830	5234431	Studio 54 music, okay?
5234451	5234651	Right?
5234671	5234831	Right.
5237959	5247686	Okay, the only thing that would make that good for like, like even, what were you saying it was good for, anal?
5248167	5248487	Yeah.
5248987	5250989	If the person was constipated.
5251930	5253711	Okay.
5253771	5255913	On a station, on a scale of one to ten?
5257454	5257734	Three.
5258695	5258995	Alright.
5259035	5263038	Just because it gets a little bit of good because Donna Summer has a very nice voice.
5263338	5263798	Yes, she does.
5264259	5265580	But her moaning needs to go.
5265600	5267201	Uh, lanky style.
5267850	5268250	Your thoughts?
5270852	5271293	Oh, I'm here.
5274255	5282181	My rating for it, probably, as like a song, I give it, you know, for what it does in its genre, I think it's pretty good, it's 8.
5283121	5286003	But for being on our station, I give it a 2.
5286404	5287905	It should not be on Orange Lounge.
5289506	5289926	Who?
5290767	5292068	Alright, who that?
5292628	5293429	Rice Princess.
5297487	5298508	The song sucked.
5298628	5300908	It was way boring, too.
5301249	5301729	Loki!
5303089	5304190	What's he doing in my chair?
5304210	5305310	It's like all breaking.
5308591	5309151	Anyways.
5310732	5316013	I give it an 8 because it's the best damn sex music that's on this record.
5317134	5320755	And you have to understand it's sex making out music.
5320835	5321955	It's not meant to be dancing.
5321995	5323816	You don't dance while you're supposed to be having sex.
5324349	5327091	This is like when I watch TV instead of having sex.
5329673	5330634	Well, that's different, okay?
5330654	5332655	That had more of an upbeat to it, okay?
5332695	5334797	And they knew that they were there at the Dance Dance Fuck.
5334857	5335698	I mean, this is like Studio 54.
5337659	5339420	I have two words for that song.
5342923	5346165	Dumbass, it's not a word, it's a sound clip.
5346626	5349168	I'd rather listen to the Dance Dance Fuck music than that.
5349828	5350629	No, it was okay.
5350709	5350869	I mean...
5351519	5354060	That's what my next week's cage match pick is going to be.
5355501	5356502	The moaning was cool.
5356862	5357562	I'll give it that.
5358142	5363305	But otherwise, I'm glad that I no longer have the crappiest cage match pick in Orange Lounge history.
5363365	5364166	So thank you for that.
5364526	5366627	So for that, I won't give you a one.
5366647	5368488	I'll give you a two.
5368568	5370129	I didn't even try to find bad.
5370169	5371169	You want me to find bad.
5371309	5371649	Oh, man.
5371689	5372190	That's all right.
5372210	5372570	That's all right.
5373150	5373410	All right.
5373470	5376052	Speaking of my picks, let's get to my pick for this week.
5377332	5378653	This is a little trancy song.
5378673	5380494	This is an artist that was suggested to me.
5381095	5383517	You, nothing but you The reason for living I lay my life on you
5410017	5414420	You, nothing but you, you're calling to me, I lay my hand on you
5511782	5531713	Nothing but you, the reason for living, I lay my love on you You, nothing but you, the calling to be in, I lay my hand on you
5540888	5542329	Thanks for watching!
5608363	5612205	You, nothing but you The calling to be in I lay my hand on you You
5631058	5636900	My pick for the case match this week, that was Nomi with you, and I don't think anyone in here was listening, but let's see anyway.
5637000	5637941	It was kind of boring.
5638001	5639141	Jamie, you thought it was boring?
5639161	5640361	I think it was going to put me to sleep.
5641342	5645503	It's pretty, so it gets like a 7, but it made me sleepy.
5645884	5646604	It made you sleepy.
5647024	5649505	Alright, anyone else want to comment on Nomi, you?
5651346	5651506	Eh.
5653126	5654267	Eh, 3, it was kind of boring.
5656307	5657728	Play some good stuff on there.
5657768	5658728	I'd stick my tongue out at you.
5659749	5660429	Alright, Brad?
5662503	5663824	Are we talking about playing good stuff?
5663904	5665145	Orange Lounge means crap.
5666406	5667667	Crap radio, crap music.
5667847	5668907	Thanks for listening, everybody.
5670408	5671890	Um, it was alright.
5671930	5672530	It was mediocre.
5672650	5673090	I'd say 7.
5675332	5675672	Loki.
5678894	5679315	Give me the mic.
5679335	5679515	Okay.
5680015	5681456	Um, it was okay.
5681476	5683057	It started off good for like 5 seconds.
5683177	5684658	Damn, my poster's all fucked up!
5685119	5685479	Nah, anyway.
5685919	5689922	Um, so then... Yeah, it was alright.
5690042	5691183	It was like... I don't know.
5692234	5700897	I was just going to say, you're lucky that I played the Donna Summer song because Rob was suggesting that I play Party All The Time by Eddie Murphy.
5700977	5702117	So I'd be glad.
5702197	5704558	I have plenty of other really shitty records that I could have played.
5707278	5712700	My song was fabulous, as it always is, and it'll be the sleeper hit of Orange Lounge 2003.
5712760	5713600	It gets a 10.
5715381	5715741	Next!
5716141	5716781	Alright, next.
5716961	5719442	Jamie, would you be kind enough to intro your pick for us?
5720069	5723030	Fantastic Plastic Machine with Take Me to the Disco.
5723650	5724611	And what else did they do?
5724971	5726872	They did Beautiful Days and Beatmania CDX.
5727052	5727692	Buy their album.
5727732	5728352	It's called Beautiful.
5728492	5729292	It's released in the U.S.
5729713	5731293	Get it at half.com for $6.
5732053	5732854	All right, here it is.
5733254	5734034	What is the name again?
5735155	5736015	Take Me to the Disco.
5736615	5737035	Is that right?
5737475	5738956	I think it's Disco After Something.
5739576	5739936	Oh, it is?
5740276	5741497	Disco at the End of the World.
5741617	5741997	Oh, that's it.
5742017	5742697	Disco at the End of the World.
5742717	5744318	Well, they do a song called Take Me to the Disco.
5744858	5745518	I thought that was one.
5745538	5745899	Never mind.
5746439	5746939	That's all right.
5747287	5747768	We forgive you.
5747928	5750431	It's Disco at the End of the World by Fantastic Plastic Machine.
5752374	5752694	Enjoy.
6026952	6030253	Alright, a fantastic classic machine with disco at the end of the world.
6030333	6032073	Let's hear what folks thought.
6032733	6036654	I'll have to bring you a copy of the original Take Me to the Disco.
6037594	6040514	Just because it's like, you'll hear what parts they took to make that.
6040554	6044855	It's like a weird remix of the song, which for me, I think it's just kind of neat to play Ragnarok to that music.
6045695	6050156	So I give it an 8 myself, just because it's one of my neat little things I listen to when I'm bored.
6050956	6052016	Alrighty, Lanky Stout?
6054217	6055977	Um, hard to say.
6056077	6056197	It's
6057296	6060537	Maybe it's a little too repetitive for me, so I'd have to probably give it like a 6.
6062718	6066059	And also, you know, Beautiful Days is so much better than that song.
6066479	6068300	I guess I've been jaded by that song.
6069980	6070741	Bryce Princess?
6072401	6076563	It was way better than the crap that you played the last two songs, so I give it a 7.
6078003	6078403	All right.
6078703	6079063	Loki?
6080644	6080924	Eh.
6082505	6083405	And on a scale of 1 to 10?
6083565	6083725	Eh.
6086406	6086786	All right.
6088099	6092822	I found myself bopping my head to it a little bit, kind of like a Night at the Roxbury type thing, so that was pretty cool.
6093222	6095784	I agreed to get it maybe a little bit repetitive, but not too bad.
6095804	6099226	I don't know, I could put up with it.
6099266	6101068	I could put up for maybe three minutes of it, just not four.
6101508	6106351	But it was still pretty cool, so I give it a... I give it an eight.
6106792	6107112	Why not?
6107933	6116218	Okay, so, let's run through the three songs you can vote for one more time, and then you can send your votes in over private message to Sky in the chat room.
6116258	6116879	Here they are.
6117372	6123996	You can vote for Donna Summer with, uh, what the hell was that called?
6124217	6125437	Love to Love Ya, Baby.
6126118	6127138	Play a little clip for me.
6128119	6129680	Just drop it in the middle and hit start.
6133162	6133583	Here we go.
6135784	6136285	Oh yeah.
6138526	6140507	Alright, that's Donna Summer with Love to Love Ya, Baby.
6140988	6142549	Or you can vote for Nomi with You.
6150810	6154591	Or you can vote for Fantastic Plastic Machine with Disco at the end of the world.
6165876	6167076	Alright, so there they are.
6167156	6168396	Send in your votes now.
6168777	6170177	The voting is open now.
6170257	6172198	So send those votes to Sky in the chat room.
6172728	6180572	Write in candidates for a song that was not played as one of those three will be thrown out and you cannot vote again and we will taunt you and make fun of you openly on the show.
6181433	6183354	And then we'll find you and start drawing on you.
6183774	6186235	We will wiggle our private parts in your general direction.
6187276	6190197	My mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries.
6190357	6195620	And don't threaten to not vote for anything because we've already gotten one vote so we have a winner either way.
6195860	6199802	So if it comes down to one vote then I guess it'll be a one vote win.
6200463	6201143	Fine by me.
6202674	6206115	because we're evil dictators and we always get our way.
6207336	6209776	Either evil dictators or just evil dicks, I don't know.
6210037	6210477	That's right.
6212177	6213078	Okay, so.
6213458	6216459	Rob, by the way, you need to get rid of the Furby, okay?
6216699	6217159	The Furby?
6217259	6218159	I love my Furby.
6218199	6219740	You need to put the Furby in the back.
6221240	6222141	My Furby's cool.
6224061	6225002	Yes, give me.
6226002	6226282	Hey.
6226742	6227242	Oh, no.
6228423	6229503	Now the parrot's coming.
6230183	6230964	It was the coyote.
6231404	6232064	Oh, it's the coyote.
6232461	6236003	Yeah, it's like the desert dog.
6236503	6238965	It's a parrot coyote.
6239265	6247630	Very interesting.
6247850	6251092	I have to stop drinking now because I have to run to the store after the show's over.
6252433	6256295	I know, I've only had half a bottle, but I need to stop.
6256596	6258057	I need to let my system process it.
6260218	6260378	So...
6260945	6262466	Hey, let's do listless.
6262827	6263547	Let's do listless?
6263927	6264348	We can't.
6264688	6265989	We've got to find paper and pens, though.
6266109	6268171	So let's do a quick break while we find paper and pens.
6268911	6271894	We just break with a bunch of music, so I feel like we've got to talk about something.
6271914	6272654	I'll find paper.
6272674	6273795	We've got to talk about something.
6275356	6275637	Where?
6275657	6275697	Oh!
6277458	6277658	Yay!
6277678	6277738	Woo!
6287385	6290348	Do you have anything interesting you'd like to share, Rice Princess?
6290608	6290888	You know what?
6291248	6292489	I have something I do want to talk about.
6292549	6295952	Because I haven't been to Scandia yet since they've done this.
6296052	6299675	But apparently, and I never knew this about 2DX machines.
6300636	6302297	And I wish Brad was here to hear it, but he's not.
6302497	6302878	That's fine.
6304419	6309623	The thing about 2DX machines, I guess, is that they have like an S video output and a VGA output.
6310604	6315648	And for the longest time at Scandia in Sacramento, where Orange Lounge is headquartered in Sacramento...
6316095	6318276	They've been using S-Video and it's been kind of blurry.
6318316	6319156	I mean, it's been playable.
6319176	6319977	It's been very playable.
6320217	6321157	But, you know, a little bit blurry.
6321177	6323858	You don't get quite that crystal clearness that you get when you play it at home.
6324298	6324518	Right?
6324999	6328960	But now they've switched over to VGA and I guess a lot of people really like the differences.
6329060	6332882	So, I haven't seen the differences myself, but what do you guys think of it?
6333482	6335043	Like the difference between S-Video and VGA?
6335303	6339725	It's nice to be able to see everything, like all the options you picked and stuff like that.
6339765	6341605	You know, like 717 and stuff like that.
6342206	6344666	It's a bit bright for me.
6344727	6345067	I don't know.
6345107	6345827	Maybe I'm just
6347035	6350397	I thought maybe it was darker before, but it was just a little bit brighter for me.
6350457	6354038	But otherwise, you know, it's kind of the same for me.
6354279	6357320	I guess I don't really notice that kind of stuff, you know, too much.
6358901	6360722	It makes a difference when you're playing at higher speed.
6360762	6362623	You can see your keys a lot clearly.
6363143	6368946	The color needs a little bit... It's not like as bad as, say, like AI's machine was before, you know, with the discoloration.
6370646	6371787	It's just slightly off.
6371807	6373748	The contrast needs to be adjusted, but since the...
6374497	6376777	The menus are all in Japanese, it might be a little bit hard to read.
6377558	6382019	They changed over... Am I the only person who notices that it looks better?
6383679	6394341	Okay, I just... I'm sorry, I just came out of the bathroom, so I missed something, but it looks like everybody I've seen so far has said that it looks like crap, like it's been, like, really discolored and stuff.
6394621	6396382	You know, I think before it was discolored.
6396562	6403423	Now it looks clear, I can play almost anything on high speed 3 with, like, no problem, except, of course, like, Sakura and Max 300 and stuff.
6404634	6405554	I mean, it looks way better.
6406374	6409295	I don't know, I may have some weird... Even on high speed it looks great.
6409315	6413876	I played Lab during the last break.
6414456	6415437	Yeah, we already heard Lab.
6416317	6417337	But Lab's good, so play it again.
6420498	6420658	No.
6422698	6426719	Although the Act from 9th is pretty much just Lab.
6427059	6429840	And it's got like a, kind of a, well not a similar video...
6430737	6432518	It's like an anime girl, like, running.
6432959	6434379	Like a CG anime-ish girl.
6435360	6435860	It's pretty cool.
6436681	6439043	Hey, I've already had to throw out two votes for Cage Match.
6439063	6439663	Pretty cool, huh?
6440544	6441204	Any reason why?
6441224	6443766	Uh, yes, they both voted for Rob's voice the game.
6445907	6447848	My listeners are such retards.
6448068	6449770	Oh, was that my outside voice talking?
6449870	6450390	I'm sorry.
6451191	6453272	You know, we have some listeners who are some real retards.
6456314	6456934	But we love you.
6458348	6459329	We love you, but you lose.
6460129	6460649	Rules are rules.
6461149	6461469	Exactly.
6461510	6463050	We love you like our retarded children.
6464711	6465992	You know, we have to love you.
6466932	6468072	The state says we have to.
6468092	6470854	We keep you in the attic.
6470894	6472655	They're the special ones we keep in the attic.
6473835	6474435	Or the basement.
6474795	6476336	But we take them out of the basement when it rains.
6477597	6480398	Because, you know, if they get sick, then we have to start taking them to the doctor.
6481218	6482219	Oh, but they're saying something.
6482359	6482459	Oh.
6484730	6487332	I think that CDs are cool because you can see the spindle through them.
6488613	6489334	All distorted-y.
6490195	6490475	Anyway.
6491416	6495439	Ah, retarded kids are already broke, so, I mean, we'll... You don't really have to take them anywhere.
6495820	6497141	You can't really tell the difference, you know?
6499303	6509632	Especially if you have, like, any blows to the head or anything, you know, and you think that they might give you damage and you're like, and you forgot, and you're like, oh, that's right, that was like that before you got hit in the head.
6511488	6512929	Now the chatroom's getting defensive.
6514089	6516490	So when did you guys start taking things we say seriously?
6516911	6517911	Seriously, you guys.
6518071	6518411	Seriously.
6519012	6519892	Don't take things seriously.
6519912	6520452	Look at the cow!
6520512	6521373	Look at the cow!
6521433	6522073	It says, bark!
6522393	6522934	Bark, bark!
6523654	6524174	Woo!
6525095	6526215	Bark, bark, cow!
6526675	6526996	I don't know.
6527016	6529897	I think it's the upstairs, uh... I think it's the upstairs neighbors.
6529937	6532518	Our neighbors are pissed at us because we're making retarded jokes.
6532538	6534099	They didn't like those cage mat pics either.
6534219	6535099	Yeah, exactly.
6536240	6536440	Okay.
6536620	6539442	Well, they've been, like, totally banging on the, like, ceiling.
6539462	6540142	I don't know, like...
6541972	6550436	I don't know what they're doing upstairs, but... It's an older lady and her daughter.
6550576	6552117	No, it's her daughter.
6552237	6556059	No, it's an older lady and her daughter.
6556099	6556759	I think it's their daughter.
6556959	6559440	But, like, I hear banging on the walls all the time.
6560681	6561562	Yeah.
6561582	6563082	Wasn't it the one with the cat?
6563182	6563603	No, that wasn't.
6563623	6564243	It was the alien's.
6567163	6579410	All I'm saying is they can go suck it because it's before 10 and, you know, yeah.
6579670	6581891	Mike, please, what?
6583272	6588935	No, we were talking about, that was the one with the spheres, they take the energy out of their body.
6589316	6592417	I mean, I haven't seen that movie in forever and I couldn't remember what that movie was, thank you.
6592898	6595119	But no, this is a different movie with the mother and her son.
6595939	6606328	And they were like fucking... And the cats could see... The cats could see that they were really alien or demon or something.
6606628	6608409	And then the cats killed them at the end of the movie.
6609831	6611492	Oh, DarkTetsuya had a good idea.
6611512	6611872	What?
6611932	6614795	He said that the upstairs folks might be playing World Class Track Meet.
6617357	6618378	You remember on the Nintendo?
6618458	6619799	I know they're playing Dance Aerobics.
6621120	6622281	Woot woot, DarkTetsuya.
6623413	6624974	I think he gets an honorary zing for that.
6624994	6625895	That was like a half zing.
6625915	6630598	That was a z. He gets a coyote.
6632500	6634081	He gets a non-retard.
6635502	6639004	He's our official non-retarded listener of the day.
6639045	6640706	He's the special listener of the day now.
6643528	6644328	Happy ferret to you.
6644428	6646690	I'm here to chew bubblegum and that's all.
6648291	6649512	And I'm all out of bubblegum.
6649532	6651213	So I'm not doing anything.
6651554	6651834	Goodbye.
6652555	6660118	God, I will never forget in Nintendo Power when they had that segment on like the kids who were having the slumber party and playing the Power Pad game or whatever.
6660358	6667381	They had like the red team and the yellow team and they were playing... Remember it was like this highlight on the Power Pad and kids having fun?
6667601	6668602	Sorry, I wasn't a dork.
6669622	6670222	Come on.
6670482	6672103	Come on, surely somebody remembers that.
6672563	6672923	Surely.
6672963	6677505	I remember you telling me about submitting to be in some video game.
6678145	6679506	You submitted... Shut up.
6680046	6680826	You're a dork.
6681827	6682087	Dude.
6683752	6684553	You're such a dork.
6685414	6685694	You know what?
6685754	6686755	I wish we could get a power pad.
6686775	6687836	I remember Howard and Esther.
6687996	6689297	Do you have a power pad, Jamie?
6689497	6689837	Yes, I do.
6689857	6694381	You need to bring that shit over and we should have a world-class track in the Orange Lounge one day.
6695022	6695202	No.
6696143	6696403	No?
6696663	6697804	I'll bring over the power glove.
6697905	6698465	It's so bad.
6699946	6701608	No, I remember Howard and Esther.
6701928	6703409	Actually, I'll try to find it.
6703509	6706993	There's an archive that has almost every Howard and Esther comic online.
6707013	6708154	I remember seeing that somewhere.
6708194	6709635	You pointed it to me before, I think.
6710180	6711120	Long-ass time ago.
6711200	6712201	Long-ass time ago.
6712221	6713842	But I remember the Mega Man ones.
6720024	6730389	I like that Howard Nestor one, but I want to find somebody who has scans of all the Zelda comics that were in the Nintendo Power, because those were cool, and the Metroid ones, and the Star Fox ones, because they were all cool.
6730749	6733190	I think I have an archive that has the Zelda ones.
6733502	6736224	I still need to download episodes of the Zelda cartoon.
6736264	6738145	Well, excuse me, princess.
6739486	6743128	Before my computer died, I had the one where he was invisible.
6743688	6747250	Where he stands up in the middle of Ganon's chamber and goes, Zelda loves me, Zelda loves me!
6747471	6748571	And then they all get shot at.
6753054	6753974	Yay, quiet.
6755075	6756576	Sorry, we're gossiping.
6757917	6759498	Well, stop gossiping, dammit.
6760258	6761419	It's all about you, too.
6761739	6762059	Bitch.
6762079	6762920	Bitch.
6765444	6765644	What?
6765684	6765884	Yeah.
6766465	6766685	This?
6767345	6767546	Yeah.
6768046	6769767	I can, I suppose, if I have to.
6771268	6771829	Eh, a little bit.
6772810	6773790	We need to be loud.
6774731	6778134	Okay, we're going to take a break, and when we come back, we're going to have Liss Liss.
6779775	6781676	I didn't know they had a monkeypox virus.
6781856	6782417	That's funny.
6782437	6784238	Yeah, I was reading about that on AOL.
6784418	6789462	They showed a picture of a prairie dog on there, and the prairie dog looked like it was the prairie dog of Satan.
6789562	6790343	You are monkeypox.
6791018	6791278	That's it.
6791298	6792979	That's gonna be the new... It was making this face, Rob.
6793019	6793319	Okay.
6793639	6794439	It was like... Sars?
6794479	6796300	He's like... I have a prairie dog of Satan.
6796320	6803862	Move on over to Sars because for the second quarter of 2003, yes, monkeypox will be the official virus of Orange Lounge Radio.
6805082	6806163	Is it replacing SARS?
6806383	6806843	Yes, it is.
6807603	6807763	Okay.
6807803	6809024	It's monkeypox dense.
6809684	6812385	So now... So now, Rob, do you have monkeypox?
6813385	6814585	Monkeypox!
6814805	6815786	Monkeypox!
6817646	6819127	Okay, well then...
6820689	6847161	I guess on that note, why don't we head off Hey look, it's Paul and Terry Alright, on that note, we're going to head off to break and when we come back we will announce this week's cage match winner so this is your last chance to submit a vote unless you've already been disqualified and when we come back, more show and list lists so we're going to take a chance to prepare our list lists for tonight so we'll be back and on that note
6902092	6902553	and the rest.

7278067	7280029	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
7281290	7284754	We are live, and I bet you're all dying to know who won tonight's cage match.
7286735	7288857	Well, here it is, kids.
7289518	7292681	Tonight's cage match winner is... Drumroll, please.
7295788	7296768	Fabulous, here it is!
7299069	7299490	Wee!
7299870	7304532	It's Fantastic Classic Machine with Disco at the end of the world.
7305912	7306172	What?
7306412	7307633	Makes me want to shake my booty.
7308253	7309013	Shake your booty.
7309053	7309574	So there it is.
7310834	7311614	Thank you for playing.
7314856	7315716	Ha, no more Matrix!
7319157	7322079	Ha, I didn't enter the Matrix into the frickin' contest.
7322099	7324179	And ha, my song would have been gone this week anyways.
7324700	7325340	So there.
7327461	7328161	I have had a sniff.
7328802	7329202	All right.
7330442	7337126	So what we decided to do this segment, Brad went out to go run an errand, so we're going to hold off on list lists until the next segment.
7337186	7339727	But guess what we have tonight, everybody?
7339787	7340487	Are you ready, Irene?
7341808	7342528	Okay.
7342728	7344929	Loki, you're going to have to be the timer since there's nobody else here.
7344989	7345890	So you ready for this, too?
7346610	7347470	You have to be a timer.
7347510	7348651	Can you time 30 seconds?
7350952	7351512	All right, good.
7352833	7353433	All right, hold on.
7353453	7354934	I have to cue up the music here.
7359210	7359590	Hold on.
7360090	7360390	Sorry.
7361151	7363913	I'm having a little problem finding the music.
7364033	7364293	You know what?
7364333	7367295	I need to put all the theme songs in a separate folder.
7367335	7372599	Because my drive, if you haven't already figured it out, is very dirty.
7373220	7373740	You silly.
7373980	7375341	It's going to get dirty.
7375441	7378123	It's going to get a little... Oh my God, no.
7379084	7379364	Okay.
7379804	7381486	One of you has to leave, right?
7382486	7382727	Yes.
7382887	7385489	Well, we're not starting right now, but we have to have the theme songs.
7385509	7385989	So here we go.
7389753	7392435	Now, it's time for Orange Crush.
7392776	7394117	It's everybody's favorite segment.
7394457	7395658	It's Orange Crush.
7396159	7398881	Who knows the most on Orange Crush?
7399242	7402124	It's Rob vs. Jamie today on Orange Crush.
7402204	7402445	Yep.
7403586	7403906	Alright.
7403926	7406769	Should I leave or should Jamie leave?
7406809	7407349	It doesn't matter.
7407389	7408050	I'll go ahead and leave.
7408070	7408710	Whoever wants to.
7408830	7409291	I'll leave.
7410256	7412518	Oh, wait, you can't tell me tonight's Orange Car.
7412558	7413359	I guess I just have to go.
7413379	7416281	You have to wait until you come back, you silly.
7416581	7417962	This one doesn't go all the way back there.
7418022	7418863	How about to me?
7419343	7419604	Okay.
7419624	7421005	Go to me, and then I'll pass this one.
7421925	7423046	Yay, it works.
7423387	7423707	Okay.
7425208	7425448	Okay.
7427069	7427930	We'll wait until you're done.
7430953	7432214	Okay, is he ready?
7433395	7435116	Okay, are you ready, Matt?
7435256	7436997	Or just let me know.
7437978	7438399	Wait, wait, wait.
7438459	7438899	No, no, no, no, no.
7439700	7445244	The name of this one is called Destiny and it's questions about Politary.
7446804	7447625	I knew it would be so funny.
7447665	7448886	Okay, tell me when you're ready, Matt.
7451868	7454149	Okay, where was she born and how old is she?
7454669	7456690	Italy, 25.
7457071	7459332	Okay, what is her mother's occupation?
7460112	7460633	Opera singer.
7461633	7464035	What is the name of her acid jazz band?
7465095	7466616	Politary, blows me hard.
7467617	7469078	What is her alter ego's name?
7470606	7471347	Not Politary.
7472387	7474128	Where did she live until she was 16?
7475349	7475629	Italy.
7476850	7477230	Okay.
7478931	7481353	Do I say how many you got right and wrong yet, or do I wait?
7481533	7483434	Oh, okay.
7483654	7484194	Time's up.
7484655	7486156	You only got one right.
7487196	7488517	Yay!
7488837	7492580	Well, that's not bad, considering most of the time people usually don't get a lot of them right.
7493280	7494581	Now it's Rob's turn.
7494681	7495541	Should I leave?
7495722	7496142	Yeah.
7496362	7496622	Okay.
7496662	7497583	I'm not going to Rob's room.
7497623	7498223	I'll go to Beth's room.
7498283	7498403	Okay.
7498423	7498523	Okay.
7500500	7502020	I fear the room of Rob.
7502681	7503641	Okay, yeah.
7504721	7505741	Just don't go potty.
7510583	7512163	Did you hear anything of that at all, Rob?
7512763	7512923	No.
7513523	7514303	You're going to love this.
7514403	7516544	Okay, how did Jamie do?
7521246	7521706	Ireland, and 27th.
7548522	7550403	Okay, what is her mother's occupation?
7550503	7551564	No, she was born in Australia.
7551924	7553084	What is her mother's occupation?
7555806	7556206	A chef.
7557387	7558987	What is the name of her acid jazz band?
7559448	7559768	I don't know.
7560288	7561489	What is her alter ego's name?
7563830	7564390	Donna Summer.
7564910	7566271	Okay, where did she live until she was 16?
7567792	7568192	Australia.
7569433	7570193	Okay, is that it?
7572834	7573074	Okay.
7573094	7573215	Okay.
7575254	7579938	Since your first answer was incorrect, that one doesn't count, the first question.
7580098	7580459	Oh, come on.
7580479	7584342	And it's a two-part question, which means it counts for one point, so you get a half point.
7584562	7585023	Oh, goody.
7585083	7585523	What was that?
7585583	7586884	Okay.
7587104	7588425	Do we have to get Jamie in here, too?
7588466	7589606	Yeah, Jamie can come out.
7589907	7590427	Okay.
7590467	7591688	So you got a half a point.
7591708	7594291	Wait, I got a half point overall?
7594571	7594771	Yeah.
7595011	7595692	That sucks.
7595912	7596152	Yeah.
7596432	7597373	I don't like this game.
7598754	7600376	I don't like games where Jamie beats me.
7600396	7602718	You're the only one who doesn't like it.
7603524	7606205	We're like, Jamie, it's time to come out now.
7607786	7608547	Okay, is she up?
7609187	7611268	No, I think she's, you know.
7611628	7611968	Uh-oh.
7614510	7615170	No, no, no, no, no.
7615490	7617471	Okay, should I just read the answer?
7617531	7617892	I don't know.
7617952	7618592	Sure, why not?
7619332	7622434	Okay, well, the first question, how old is she and where was she born?
7622912	7624032	She's 27 years old.
7624072	7624553	Oh, wow.
7625153	7628254	And she was born in Australia, but you said... Come on.
7628274	7630075	You said Ireland or something first.
7630255	7631115	I changed it.
7631636	7631776	Wham.
7631796	7632076	It hit me.
7632116	7632716	Come on.
7632736	7633596	My clit hurts.
7633636	7634657	Is that the one... Okay, fine.
7634697	7635277	I'll make it one.
7635297	7635797	You're still tied.
7635837	7636077	Wham.
7636137	7637418	Is that the one she got right?
7637718	7637858	No.
7638778	7640019	Okay, did you hear that, Jamie?
7640599	7644861	I threw a fit because I said Ireland at first for the first question, then I'm like, no way, Australia.
7644941	7646421	So I made her give it to me.
7647302	7647562	Okay.
7648470	7649911	I know, I was... I did.
7649931	7653832	Okay, he got one point anyway, and you got one point, so you guys are tied anyway.
7653852	7655012	He would have gotten a half point.
7655032	7655712	Because I guessed 27.
7655752	7656313	Whatever.
7656813	7657313	I guessed 27.
7657413	7660834	I know, anyway, yeah, so she's 27 years old, and she's born in Australia.
7661374	7664956	Her mother is an opera singer, a famous opera singer at that.
7665496	7671558	Okay, and the acid jazz band she's a part of is called Cracker Jam, because she's white, I guess, I don't know.
7671658	7675879	Her alter ego... Naoki, right?
7676559	7677980	Close, but no, it's Sonya.
7678601	7679801	That's her alter ego's name.
7680922	7684043	And she lived... Oh, God.
7684623	7687104	She lived in France until she was 16.
7687624	7688804	No wonder she's so stupid.
7690005	7690425	Oh, God.
7690765	7692546	Yeah, and other interesting facts.
7692586	7693126	She's married.
7693926	7695027	But she tells everyone she saw it.
7695587	7697267	Yeah, and she lives in Japan.
7698388	7699168	Wow, that's it.
7699308	7701909	That concludes another segment of Orange Crush.
7705770	7707531	Hold on, I have to get back to the computer so I can...
7708692	7710133	Officially close out this segment.
7714596	7716138	God, that's like shitty radio, Rob.
7717218	7719920	That's the end of Orange Crush.
7720181	7723263	Politary really sucked on Orange Crush.
7723843	7725685	One point for Rob.
7725785	7726525	I don't care.
7727226	7730188	Australia was the answer, not that country with red hair.
7730348	7730748	Okay.
7733070	7733450	Okay.
7733470	7735031	I said Italy.
7735512	7736292	You said Italy.
7741610	7746333	Hey, I technically got one right because I said not Politary for her alter ego.
7747134	7747974	Ah, true.
7748515	7748895	Whatever.
7748955	7753298	So if you can get Australia, then I get not Politary.
7753318	7754498	Then you get, you know what's your prize?
7754518	7756800	You get to listen to Politary music all night long.
7757400	7758861	You know what you can do?
7759622	7760422	You know what you can do?
7760843	7761103	What?
7761443	7762364	Pick a key, please.
7763584	7764305	And stay in it.
7771494	7775357	YouSuck.com So did we learn something?
7775397	7780561	Chat room, did we learn something from tonight's Orange Crush segment?
7780681	7786525	You know, it's actually kind of neat because now we know who to hold for ransom if we ever want to have Paul Cherry never sing again.
7787986	7788426	Excellent.
7789467	7789847	Thank you.
7789867	7790968	I mean, that was cool.
7791749	7793150	I love the Orange Crush segment, Irene.
7793710	7795591	How do you do your research for that?
7795611	7796532	So that we know where to look.
7797553	7799214	On a mic, on a mic, on a mic.
7803288	7803888	Quiet.
7804269	7804909	Wow.
7806130	7807991	It's so, so quiet.
7810832	7811213	You know what?
7811293	7814014	I got my Bjork tickets today, and I have to sell them.
7814495	7814795	Why?
7815195	7816896	Because I'm going to go to Cyber Beat Nation 2.
7817436	7818217	I want to go.
7819117	7819638	Who's she playing?
7819678	7820478	You want to go to Bjork?
7820698	7821058	Yeah.
7821399	7823900	Can you afford to pay me kickback some for the tickets?
7823920	7825461	Because I'm probably going to have to get the cost.
7825481	7827102	A hundred bucks for two.
7827923	7828643	Yeah, it's a lot.
7830032	7834795	I'm probably going to put them on eBay if none of my friends take them just because I need to make my money back so I have money to spend in LA.
7834975	7836195	When's the concert?
7836295	7837156	It is August 8th.
7837396	7838537	Where?
7838697	7840357	At Pier 3032 in San Francisco.
7842118	7842979	I can't go to that anyway.
7843739	7844639	Classic Gaming Expo?
7844940	7845620	Oh, that's right.
7845780	7847001	You're going to be at the Classic Gaming Expo.
7847041	7848041	Did you already register for that?
7848501	7848741	No.
7849222	7849322	Oh.
7850042	7850682	I guess I should.
7850702	7852703	You're just going to show up at the door and go, Hey!
7852723	7855185	I'll talk to Xander about it.
7855205	7855305	Hey!
7856285	7857906	I'll talk to Xander about it because I can't go to Fonamay.
7861364	7861845	I don't care.
7862485	7865607	Well, it's just because, you know, what's the point of going if I can't cosplay?
7869770	7870751	What else was I going to say?
7870951	7871511	I don't remember.
7873513	7876835	Cyber Beat Nation 2, there's this little teaser.
7876875	7878196	They've been teasing it online.
7878216	7882499	They have a little teaser trailer that's out, and it's pretty cool.
7883800	7887762	They hint at that there's going to be perfect attack singles and doubles this time around.
7887802	7888563	That should be interesting.
7889424	7895048	And Freestyle, if I read this teaser correctly, they're saying any Bomani song you want.
7896048	7898350	Which makes me think they're going to do Freestyle on a sim.
7898570	7900371	That's just a guess, though.
7900752	7902092	That's the only way you could do it, right?
7902613	7903213	It'll never happen.
7905054	7905555	Why is that?
7906655	7915061	Because they're too dumb to find actual sim files that are synced up correctly, and then you have people going, Watch as you get an email in a couple of weeks.
7916062	7917523	Well, yeah, you're going to get an email.
7917543	7918103	Loki, help.
7918950	7923554	But actually, what if people were responsible for making their own sim files and bringing them in?
7923934	7925435	That's what I would have meant.
7925455	7926115	That'll happen.
7926536	7927316	That'll be awful.
7928657	7933641	If they're giving away another arcade machine, you can bet people will go to the distance to make it happen.
7933801	7934821	I think it could be successful.
7935122	7937003	Hell, at Shaft we ended up using a sim.
7938984	7941086	Because I'm cool and I'm the only one that can pull it off.
7942487	7945429	Only one anywhere that can pull it off.
7946972	7949274	No one will be able to do it, except for me.
7949954	7951495	Me, me, me, me, me.
7953777	7954498	Oh, really now?
7956119	7956479	Okay.
7958341	7965846	Um, segue into the sim section of... Okay, stuff that's going on.
7966166	7971310	Um, first off, um, you've got a couple sites, um, you know, going through redesigns.
7971330	7973572	You have Maniacs and stuff being the site, and it looks pretty.
7974342	7978967	You've got Tourney Mix 4, which is ending their submissions in four days.
7979407	7985673	So if you've registered already, which you must have if you're joining up, have your file done in four days.
7985874	7989117	Because I need to get my file done in four days because it's not yet.
7990098	7992600	Also, there's rumored to be about 400 entries.
7992880	7995283	They've got about 10 judges, so it looks pretty cool.
7995303	7996444	They're going to be doing them.
7997225	8005150	I believe releasing a group of files every week, and then voting on those, and then a new set will come up, and so on and so forth.
8007331	8014916	Other than that, we've got... Let's see, a few fun sim files came out, like the terrible Mr. Grimshaw.
8015876	8018017	Go check that one out, from Monty Sims.
8018438	8018978	And, um...
8020678	8024181	Really, um, oh, one more interesting bit of information.
8024241	8027303	It's not really sim related, but it was on a sim site that I found it.
8027984	8037111	DDRUK, there's this guy who goes by the name Havoc on there, and he, like I, just like me, he has copies of their arcade discs.
8037151	8042896	But since, you know, you've got the UK arcade disc, he's got a Dancing Stage Euro Mix 2 disc.
8043056	8048120	And what's funny is he found some songs on the disc that weren't in the actual game itself.
8048846	8052567	And one of those songs would be from NSYNC, Bye Bye Bye.
8053888	8074214	And this is an official Konami song that was supposed to be in Euromix 2, but never made it in, or it's an unlock that, you know, obviously, because the Euromix 2 site was never finished, so, you know, maybe they just never got around to releasing unlock codes for it, but he says that's not the only song that's hidden in there, too, so there's actually more than one song, so...
8075563	8079844	I mean, we're going to find out in a few weeks here that there's going to be more and more songs.
8080084	8088486	And rumor that these songs, you know, for some reason didn't appear in Euromix 2, they might be in Euromix 3, or in fact, the licensing might have been cut on them.
8088866	8093586	It's hard to say, but that is an official song that was supposed to be in Euromix 2, Bye Bye Bye.
8094547	8095987	So, yeah.
8096447	8098127	Bye Bye Bye
8109741	8110221	And they suck.
8114084	8117246	See, I have to listen to people play The Light FM.
8117607	8120268	See, I thought I got away from it when I lost my job.
8120609	8122290	But no, people play it around me all the time now.
8123591	8124171	Guess what, though?
8124371	8124631	What?
8125032	8128754	I get them back by playing, um, I'm Gonna Make This CD Tonight Take to Work.
8129075	8129355	Uh-huh.
8129455	8130175	Of Hair Rock.
8130716	8131136	Cool.
8131416	8133718	Poison, Motley Crue, Cuds and Roses.
8134258	8135759	Walk this way!
8135779	8136640	Ha ha ha.
8139304	8139984	and Tesla.
8140144	8141585	Walk this way!
8142225	8143545	And then they have to put up with my trance.
8144385	8148386	And everyone leaves the office when I'm working my overtime, so I turn up my trance CD.
8150127	8153687	What a cool... We can't hear you, Irene.
8154928	8159269	I play Orange Lounge all day, every day, because they let me listen to it and they don't care.
8160109	8168691	It's funny, because, you know, when you play, like, Highs Off You or, you know, any other song that says, like, fuck or shit, you know, like, somebody will be a faxing next to me and they'll say that and...
8171730	8173611	He can't even understand it in Highest Off You.
8173672	8175332	He can't understand the FU in that song.
8175933	8178134	This is actually a good segue, because I wanted to go back.
8178154	8184077	You guys weren't paying attention because you were watching the Matrix thing, but Muheimer had a pretty interesting FU of the week, so I want to read this again.
8184538	8188020	He said... Welcome back!
8188180	8191041	So, I wanted to go back to Muheimer's Fuck You of the Week.
8191361	8192002	This was interesting.
8192042	8193102	He said, this was a part of it.
8193142	8197605	He says, Fuck the six flags near me, because they had to get rid of their four extremes...
8197987	8201009	because some bitch complained about the word bitch in it.
8203271	8203451	Really?
8203471	8204172	What do you guys think of that?
8204813	8205093	Where?
8205913	8206374	Bitch!
8208075	8210057	Whoever took that out, you're a bitch.
8210717	8214180	Bitches are everywhere, you can't get away from them, so just deal with it, okay?
8214660	8216982	Just like retarded kids and faggots.
8219464	8223668	The official term, or the technical term for them, are window lickers.
8229787	8236788	I'd just like to say to that woman... Wait, it's somewhere in here.
8236808	8241069	Wait, hold on, hold on.
8243049	8245070	Yeah, there you go.
8245090	8246930	What did you do every time that song played on the radio?
8246970	8249131	Did you call the station and complain and tell them to go off air?
8251411	8256532	Once again, it's stupid parents trying to get other people to parent their kids for them.
8258132	8261654	If your kids are listening, oh my god, they heard the word bitch.
8262515	8264536	Well, oh my god, turn on the TV.
8265117	8268519	Well, you know what people's fascination is with curse words anyway?
8268939	8270481	It's the fact that you tell them you can't do it.
8271441	8274603	If you don't like the word bitch, become Amish.
8275124	8280487	Children would not be as apt to curse if you acted like it was no big thing.
8281768	8285711	I hope you don't let your kids watch TV because they say bitch on it all the time.
8291828	8296271	Everyone should read the first story in The Illustrated Man, which I'm reading right now.
8296932	8301895	It talks about parenting and what happens when you don't parent your kids yourself.
8301915	8304837	And it's really bad, so yeah, you should read it.
8305357	8311482	If you have a question as to what song in DDR has bitch in it... Yes, Little Bitch.
8311502	8315504	1-2, Little Bitch.
8315664	8316125	Is everybody...
8318220	8343615	Blow Your Whistle, it says in the background, not an extreme, bitch, no that song is gone, but this is going to be interesting because the rumor is, and this is merely rumor at this point, but supposedly in that trailer for Max 2 USA, somebody caught a glimpse of the DJ Alligator Project video for Blow My Whistle, bitch, which is going to be interesting to see how the USA treats that.
8344198	8350700	Well, here's the thing, though, is he actually officially has, it wasn't, you know, the fact that it was censored, there's two different songs.
8351420	8355721	They're the same damn song, but it's Blowin' Whistle Bitch and Blowin' Whistle Baby, or The Whistle Song.
8356681	8361242	See, so that's actually, you know, the official title is, you know, The Whistle Song.
8362482	8364363	But, you know, that's over here.
8364403	8365483	You know what I call them both?
8366203	8366683	Sucks!
8367143	8373645	Well, here's the thing anyways, I mean, I'm sure they're gonna censor it, because if we have, like, you know, was it Gentle Stress, the AMD
8378974	8387562	I'm getting yelled at because I played the 1-2 Little Bitch by Bus Stop and not the specials, which is the one that's actually in Xtreme.
8387702	8389564	Sorry, get over it, my bad.
8389584	8394028	Well, actually, if you want to be technical, Little Bitch was in the first DDR.
8395890	8400634	Right, and that's why it was brought back for Xtreme, because remember they brought back a bunch of old school DDR songs like Butterfly?
8401455	8403696	Oh my god, some guy wanted me to play Butterfly the other day.
8403856	8404356	Did you do it?
8404596	8404796	No.
8405136	8405677	What'd you tell him?
8406037	8410118	I said, um, I played that a lot when the game was new!
8412919	8413879	And he's like, oh.
8415660	8417861	I was playing DDR with someone I've never met before.
8418341	8419841	I miss being able to do that, you know?
8419881	8422702	Back in the days when, like, no one knew who the other one was.
8423442	8425163	And we'd all randomly play DDR together.
8425703	8427844	And then we just sort of eventually told each other our names.
8428376	8429057	Stop it, Rob.
8430518	8431479	You can stop that right now.
8436983	8439285	Hey, let's do Listless.
8439325	8440306	Are we going to do Listless now?
8440646	8440927	Yeah.
8440987	8443789	Okay, so we have to take a quick break, and then we're going to come back and do Listless.
8444309	8446371	Play the Desro songs from Poppin' Music.
8446611	8448693	Okay, we're going to play some Desro songs from Poppin' Music.
8448773	8450855	So it's going to be not a too long of a break.
8451375	8454998	So we have Cobalt from Poppin' Music 9, and we have...
8457259	8475513	We have Pier from Poppin' Music 8 And then I'm gonna play I'm gonna play something from DDR Solo Mix just for good measure No, I'm gonna play Wonderland from 3rd Mix And when we come back Listless And what is tonight's listless topic?
8476053	8483179	Best Bimani songs to fuck by Yes, just like our live journal Best Bimani songs to fuck to We'll be back
8514355	8515116	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8545606	8545886	and many more.

8724122	8725042	and the rest of the crew.
8769595	8771416	Hi, this is Melby of RTF.
8771456	8776778	For an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Melby can join us on all the fun together.
8776798	8779439	Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am,
8798660	8803062	Why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great?
8803403	8805284	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
8805864	8809986	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
8810906	8812167	That's right, you tell him, Mel.
8812447	8819251	Our buddy, Mel B. Okay, so, back to the show and back to the listless topic at hand.
8819963	8822484	Jamie, what is the listless topic at hand?
8822524	8824124	Best demonic songs to fuck to.
8824444	8825364	Or to hand to.
8825464	8826845	To fuck to.
8827105	8827445	To fuck.
8827465	8829586	So this is UNF, the UNF-erific topic.
8829846	8830126	Yeah.
8830146	8831366	So are we ready?
8831966	8832286	I am.
8832946	8833187	Okay.
8833767	8834767	Are you going to be okay, Irene?
8836707	8837888	Because you said you weren't ready yet.
8838468	8839188	You said you weren't ready.
8839708	8840308	Okay, all right.
8840609	8841369	Who wants to start?
8841429	8841709	I will.
8842029	8842329	You will?
8842774	8845916	Okay, Jamie, number... Oh, we haven't done list list in a long time.
8845956	8847337	I guess I should explain what list list is all about.
8847417	8847717	Do you want to?
8847757	8852779	Do you want me to let... We all pick our top threes, and then we all vote one off, and then you vote.
8853220	8853420	Yes.
8854040	8858222	So the chat room has the final say, so you can vote.
8858242	8860063	And this is a scientific proven process.
8860103	8861504	This is the top three of all time.
8861564	8862085	No disputing.
8862945	8864686	Okay, so, Jamie, you're number three.
8864706	8865546	Damn it, we're the experts.
8866147	8868228	Okay, my number three is Gravity.
8869308	8869849	Gravity?
8871229	8872070	Not a Loki remix?
8873126	8874347	Oh, that's a little bit too angry.
8874387	8876528	That's like the S&M, you know.
8876548	8881290	I say Gravity because if you think about it, it's like rhythmically good.
8881570	8885852	Brad said Gravity, the anal burnination mix.
8886872	8887452	Okay, fine.
8887492	8887973	I'll go next.
8888613	8893615	My number three pick, and this would be for like if you're having some fast, dirty, rotten sex, Max 300.
8893735	8893835	Ew.
8893895	8894155	Okay.
8894756	8894856	Okay.
8902201	8903142	Loki, your number three pick.
8906163	8911605	I was going to say probably we've got to go with Hot Limit because it's a longer song.
8911925	8914887	And, you know, people like things that are longer.
8915907	8917188	I'm not going to make a comment.
8918208	8918808	It doesn't work.
8919929	8920349	It doesn't.
8921589	8921829	What?
8922770	8922890	Oh.
8922910	8923530	It doesn't work.
8923670	8924170	Oh, my.
8924671	8925151	Oh, my.
8926671	8927092	Oh, my.
8928072	8929333	As the room slowly gets it.
8929373	8930033	La, la, la, la, la.
8931485	8932005	Okay.
8932025	8937087	Yeah, I know, seriously.
8937367	8938708	Alright, Irene, your turn.
8941289	8946050	Um, I picked a serious one, Ecstasy, because, I mean, come on now, like I need to explain stuff.
8946070	8947591	Okay, Brad, your turn.
8947791	8948471	Ecstasy.
8948791	8949352	Ecstasy.
8951412	8951772	Alright.
8953433	8955094	Brad, Mr. Lanky Style.
8955134	8956114	Wait, did Matt go already?
8956134	8957975	Yeah, he did.
8957995	8958535	Everybody but you.
8961562	8963623	I'm gonna have to say In the Heat of the Night is my number three.
8966484	8967804	In the Heat of the Night!
8969385	8969705	Sorry.
8969925	8970345	Okay.
8970865	8971525	My number two?
8971985	8972746	Yes, your number two.
8973046	8974626	It's from Solo, Let the Beat Hit Em.
8975147	8976147	Let the Beat Hit Em!
8978548	8979288	Actually, no, take that back.
8979308	8981389	Not the version from Solo, the version from Max 2.
8981889	8984850	Okay, so, uh, Let the Beat Hit Em R&B style.
8985350	8985650	Yeah.
8986450	8988751	It's like if you want, you know, the slow groove.
8992222	8992482	Nice.
8993243	8993703	My turn.
8994103	9000066	My number two pick, and this is one that came to me during the break, but honestly, think about it, this song would be awesome.
9000226	9001506	This song would be awesome to have sex to.
9001867	9002847	Jam Jam Reggae.
9002867	9006629	What the fuck are you smoking, man?
9008450	9009750	Instant Softie for me.
9010191	9011711	I mean, that's not going to do anything.
9012692	9013772	I can't spell reggae.
9015493	9016374	Yeah, there you go.
9016394	9017774	There's validity behind it.
9018595	9019455	Just think about it.
9020415	9020756	A.E.
9020916	9021376	Oh, my bad.
9022915	9023375	There it is.
9024516	9025536	Sorry, I'm too white.
9025596	9026437	I'm too white to spell.
9027417	9030658	Just thinking, on the main goal, jam, jam, bring it over.
9030879	9031619	Anyway, come on.
9031679	9032339	Shut up.
9035341	9036601	Get away from me.
9037502	9037822	Irene.
9038062	9038662	Oh, sorry, Loki.
9038902	9039222	Matt.
9041003	9045025	Um, just because it's got the, you know, background to go with it.
9045285	9045985	Sexy Planet.
9046666	9050547	You took my fucking pick, you bastard.
9051168	9051888	Okay, that's fine.
9053368	9054609	Okay, so Sexy Planet.
9056150	9057411	Irene, your number two pick.
9058212	9060694	Since you took it, I have to go with Love Machine.
9061135	9061915	Love Machine.
9061975	9062336	Yeah.
9062916	9064137	I'm just a love machine.
9064197	9064798	I like that song.
9065098	9065338	Yeah.
9065939	9069101	I have another one, but I... All right.
9069942	9071223	Yeah.
9071283	9073024	Mr. Brad, your number two pick, please.
9073225	9074205	DXY, baby.
9074426	9074806	DXY.
9074846	9076247	It's got the perfect flow.
9076768	9078989	And it's got the climax in there, and then the call, you know.
9079070	9079430	Oh, my.
9080447	9084150	The flow, the climax, and the cigarette, it's all there.
9111598	9119100	It actually does have the slow build-up, the, the, yay, you know, this is fun, and then the dying.
9121841	9123602	That's if you're into asphyxiation.
9129283	9129584	So.
9132584	9134065	Guess what, everybody, this just in.
9134085	9136286	Zero's having an orange lounge party at his house in two weeks.
9136966	9137226	Yay!
9138026	9139246	Party, party.
9139266	9140047	Okay, read.
9140607	9140807	What?
9142518	9146061	Um, Zero, just, uh, thought I'd remind you a little bit.
9146902	9147722	Oh, never mind.
9148563	9149003	Continue.
9150224	9151765	What, you thought two weeks was Fanime or something?
9152766	9155728	Or what, I don't know what, uh... Exactly what I was thinking.
9158010	9159191	Well, sorta is.
9159751	9162473	In two weekends it'll be Fanime, I think.
9162533	9164155	Okay, let's keep going with the list list.
9164815	9165976	Back to list list, thank you.
9166516	9168378	My number one pick would be, of course...
9168940	9172962	Now this is obvious, I'm sorry, I am going with the obvious, because it's true, do it all night.
9177865	9182448	Alright, fine, well then fine, let's hear your number one obvious picks.
9183188	9189932	Okay, mine is going to be Wild Rush, because it starts off slow and it gets faster as it goes along.
9192153	9194114	Actually, the Wild Rush remix is pretty hot.
9196655	9196976	Alright.
9197136	9197516	Yeah!
9197556	9197636	Yeah!
9199804	9203365	Rice Princess, your number one pick.
9204065	9206486	Is no one going to say one of the other obvious songs?
9206766	9209427	It's down to you and Brad, so you better figure out.
9209927	9211788	Can I give an honorable mention?
9212928	9213388	No, say what?
9213648	9214189	Oh, okay.
9214209	9214689	After we're done.
9215229	9216929	Okay, my number one's Afranova.
9218650	9220070	Don't ask, I don't know.
9220150	9220971	Afranova.
9220991	9225152	I guess everybody was being nice to me, so they can give me the real obvious one.
9225332	9225672	Okay.
9225892	9227593	Okay, my number one choice.
9228293	9228913	Trumbo, please.
9229389	9229649	Yes.
9229829	9230389	Flash.
9232090	9232670	Please don't.
9233231	9234071	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
9234111	9234471	Thank you.
9234491	9234871	Insertion.
9235251	9236332	Insertion, thank you.
9237772	9238113	What?
9240193	9241874	Okay, now we're going to the honorable mentions.
9241954	9243395	No one said the whistle song.
9243455	9244615	No one said After the Game of Love.
9244635	9245095	After the Game of Love.
9245115	9245976	Because those suck.
9246016	9247436	Temple of Love.
9247456	9248577	Temple of Love.
9248597	9250057	No Greco-Bulman style.
9252578	9253919	All right, so here is the list.
9255512	9256633	Have you never been mellow?
9257594	9259896	Here's some of the bullshit lists I had before we go on.
9260196	9273487	Dead End, Healing Vision Angelic Mix, Hypnotic Crisis, Paranoia Dirty Mix, in case you're paranoid, you're jealous, and Crash, of course.
9274889	9277551	Actually, one of the other ones I was going to say was Paranoia Clean.
9278752	9280654	Especially the pounding one.
9281795	9283296	Or I was going to say Hellscaper.
9283752	9284612	or maybe Crimson.
9284652	9285153	Pat Center.
9288814	9289174	Anyway.
9289494	9290995	Some suggestions from the chat room.
9291535	9293036	Some suggestions from the chat room as well.
9293116	9296497	Gimme, gimme, gimme.
9296898	9297418	Let's see.
9298238	9299259	I think V is good.
9299799	9302200	V. Oh, Nick, please not so quick.
9302800	9303600	Other than Erotic.
9303620	9310243	Boom Boom Dollar, W Dub, So Many Men, It's Raining Men, Test My Best, Cowgirl.
9310323	9312104	I've heard the full version of So Many Men.
9312884	9314445	It's like she's an utter slut.
9316146	9324091	Now, I would have picked this song had it been, you know, in the actual game and not just part of the megamix, the Paranoia Evolution.
9324331	9328453	It's kind of like a trip-hop version of it.
9340908	9345190	And of course, and of course, shame on all of us for forgetting this one, Be In My Paradise.
9346231	9346791	Okay, no.
9348412	9352034	Be In My Paradise, Rob, makes me break out in hives.
9353494	9354315	It's really nasty.
9355095	9355415	Alright.
9357656	9360918	Let's, uh... Or this is like, like, um, right now.
9362038	9363179	By the way, guess what?
9363199	9364159	Come on, baby, do it.
9364179	9367261	I was looking in an old issue of People Magazine, because I leave those at my work sometimes.
9367761	9369282	There's a review for Atomic Kitten in there.
9369831	9372013	And I saw an Atomic Kitten video at Faces one night.
9372033	9372613	It was cool.
9373474	9373995	Yeah, you were there.
9374075	9374415	Yeah, yeah.
9375055	9376657	All right, so now... But they said that they suck.
9377337	9389087	A little advice, if any of you guys want to, you know, get the ladies in the mood, any Thomas Howard song or... Jeff Coot, any Jeff Coot song.
9389847	9390748	Yeah, ladies will love you.
9395011	9397013	Ladies love Thomas Howard, trust me.
9397593	9398154	Even though he's gay.
9400273	9400613	Tack.
9400853	9401214	All tack.
9401714	9402234	All the time.
9402334	9404035	Let's get to the elimination part, please.
9404396	9405436	Here's the list so far.
9405556	9418524	Gravity, Max 300, Hot Limit, Ecstasy, In the Heat of the Night, Let the Beat Hit Em R&B, Jam Jam Reggae, Sexy Planet, Love Machine, DXY, Sync, Do It All Night, Wild Rush, Afronova, and Insertion.
9418824	9420325	Jamie, what's coming off the list?
9420846	9421806	Jam Jam Ragu.
9422667	9423527	You stink.
9425228	9426709	Jam Jam Ray is the best.
9426849	9427690	Come on, you guys.
9427710	9428671	You stink.
9428691	9429251	You stink.
9431135	9436418	Mine, I'm going to take off... I don't care.
9436438	9452950	I'm going to take off... I'm just kind of drawn to the... well... I don't know why... All these songs are pretty good, but I just... I don't see gravity so much, so I'm going to take off gravity.
9453030	9453790	Listen to it.
9454931	9459434	I think of stoic, not gravity, so I think it goes back to that whole stoic versus gravity thing.
9460422	9461543	Um, no, because Matt's next.
9461623	9461863	Matt.
9464525	9469109	I don't care, but, um... Jack does not make good sex music.
9469129	9469650	Sink, bye-bye.
9472132	9473152	You are so full of shit.
9474473	9475234	Outphase, anyway.
9475594	9477916	Whatever.
9477976	9478777	Um, Irene.
9480158	9481819	I'm gonna take off Hot Limit, because it's stupid.
9482560	9483040	Thank you.
9486403	9487564	Dude, take Tylenol.
9488703	9489484	Raging Ritalin.
9489944	9492526	Um... Man, this is hard.
9492866	9496148	I didn't... I should've said Love Me Do, that would've been a good one.
9496989	9497249	Anyway.
9498750	9500571	Um... Yeah, whatever.
9500831	9504254	Okay, I'll say... Shit.
9506455	9512879	Um, I'm gonna have to go with... Let the beat hit him RB5.
9513100	9514601	Great, vote all nine off, thank you.
9514761	9515861	Did all yours get voted off?
9515921	9516162	Yes!
9516442	9518023	Oh, sorry, I didn't notice that.
9521147	9523028	I guess Jamie's are all gone, I'm sorry.
9525809	9526249	Alright.
9531931	9532271	Alright.
9534192	9534972	Here's the list.
9535772	9538013	And you folks can vote on it right now in the chatroom.
9540674	9540934	Max 300.
9541395	9542775	Ecstasy.
9543555	9544976	And I spelled it wrong, I'm sorry.
9545822	9548604	In the heat of the night, actually, why didn't it come up in my spell check then?
9548624	9549005	That's weird.
9550886	9551427	I guess so.
9552227	9562456	In the heat of the night, Sexy Planet, Love Machine, DXY, Do It All Night, Wild Rush, Afranova, and Insertion.
9563096	9566019	So, you can send those votes to me.
9566839	9569081	My name is Sky, and I'm in the chat room right now.
9569121	9569421	Hi.
9569902	9573845	And you can send your pics to me over private message, because you love me.
9575874	9586922	In the meantime, a quick break featuring, um, some more Guitar Freak songs.
9587042	9592346	How about, I'm just going to pick random ones from this little CD that Jamie gave me.
9592886	9594247	Monkey Magic, that's always a fun one.
9595588	9598430	And, um, I like monkey.
9599271	9604755	And, um, Sweet Feline, or did we, no, we already did that one, didn't we?
9607096	9607936	I don't think I did that one.
9608277	9608637	I don't know.
9608757	9610138	I'm going to pick another one.
9610538	9612519	How about Star of Muse?
9612679	9613560	Yes, that will be fun.
9613960	9616241	And then that's all the time you've got to send in your votes.
9616741	9619743	And we'll be back to wrap up the big, fat, hairy, scary show.
9621384	9621764	Stay tuned.
9622084	9622645	Yes, Loki?
9625166	9629688	Real quickly, because I know I forgot to mention it, but it is big news in case if no one's been reading.
9632190	9633911	It sort of ties in with the stuff.
9634151	9634371	Anyway...
9634997	9642104	The edit code for the DDR Extreme machine has been found, and now we can make DDR Extreme edits and have started to do so.
9643946	9644486	So, yay.
9644907	9645327	Rejoice.
9647469	9648490	Alright, we'll be back.
9667183	9668744	Thank you for watching!
9696424	9697326	Thanks for watching!
9715578	9716859	Thank you for watching!
9732385	9733866	Thank you for watching!
9976227	9977747	Hello everybody!
9980048	9980608	So what's going on?
9980628	9981629	I wasn't paying attention.
9982149	9986530	Um, I think we have to do the, um, the winner or something.
9986810	9987350	I don't know.
9987370	9988851	Supposed to be announcing the winner for something?
9990137	9992459	Yeah, but Rob's occupied.
9992479	9993620	Okay, why is it?
9993820	9994320	I want to know this.
9994640	9995081	Why is it?
9996422	10002566	Like, seriously, when we went on air, did or did not, the house line rang and my cell phone went off right when we went on air.
10002586	10003927	Then why not turn them off?
10004167	10004727	I'm going to.
10006648	10007889	I don't even remember who it was.
10008330	10008530	It was...
10009719	10010199	Who was it?
10010279	10010600	I don't know.
10010620	10014743	You know, when I used to come for my visitations to Undersedation, I would turn off my cell phone.
10014943	10018706	My cell phone wouldn't even work in there, and it hasn't been... That should have been my FU of the week.
10018786	10024550	Oh my God, my cell phone has not been working in the house even recently, so I'm surprised it even went off at all.
10024670	10025631	Who was it that called?
10025651	10026171	I don't even remember.
10026371	10027432	I guess... whatever.
10028733	10034237	Okay, so... Let's see.
10034577	10035498	Oh yes, the list list.
10035538	10036018	Here it is.
10036078	10037579	The top three songs to...
10039423	10043266	HaveSexor2, GetDirtyAndNaughty2 Third place!
10044527	10045428	Drumroll please.
10046809	10047309	Beautiful.
10047589	10048270	Ecstasy.
10049531	10050191	Yay.
10050992	10051652	That was number three.
10052413	10052873	Ecstasy.
10053354	10053714	Yay.
10055916	10056856	Second place.
10057737	10060799	The winner is... DXY!
10061320	10062020	Yay!
10063421	10064442	Yeah, second is DXY.
10065523	10068145	And in first place, ByALandslide.
10069292	10069932	Insertion.
10071453	10071953	Of course.
10072973	10076714	So.
10077274	10077934	That's that.
10078655	10079075	Listless.
10079115	10080015	Hope you guys enjoyed.
10080415	10083096	And an honorary vote for Sky's Voice the Game.
10083156	10083916	You suck.
10084176	10084696	Just kidding.
10089478	10091438	And now with some show news.
10092759	10094839	I think we'll be able to do phones next week.
10095659	10096820	And I figured out a way to do it.
10097820	10097960	So.
10098550	10106512	If you're interested in being able to do this next week, we're going to be using a program probably called PhoneFree.
10107392	10110693	And I will post a link in the chat room where you can find this program.
10110993	10112193	And just basically sign up.
10112313	10114033	It's totally free.
10114773	10119154	And what you're going to want to do is I'll also give you guys an ID number, which will be our phone number.
10120315	10123875	And so during the show, we'll have this hopefully available live.
10124416	10126396	And I should be able to answer, well...
10126823	10136672	PC phone calls, you know, it's not really using your actual phone line, phone line, it's just like, you know, almost like voice chatting over like Yahoo Instant Messenger or something like that, so maybe we're going to try that.
10137252	10138814	But anyways, I'll post links, so.
10140555	10145760	We'll probably test it out during a fuck-off show sometime in the next week, like before the weekend, I don't know.
10146420	10147982	Are you planning on doing any fuck-off shows this week, Jamie?
10148062	10149703	I know you were thinking about, yeah.
10150023	10152926	I sort of preempted the rewind Monday.
10152946	10153026	Okay.
10153844	10154285	It's all good.
10154545	10154925	You know what?
10155166	10158949	The way I think about it, the fuck-offs get more listeners than the rewinds anyway, so it's all good.
10159689	10163393	You know, I think, you know, for me it's easier just to come home and do it on Monday.
10163413	10165495	Because I'm sort of angsty anyway.
10165515	10166515	Do you want to move the rewind?
10167216	10167917	We can always move the rewind.
10167937	10169838	I don't care about when we do the rewind.
10169858	10171800	Well, we can talk... Let's go to the chat room.
10171820	10174262	Chat room, go on the live journal community.
10174282	10175723	Yes, I was going to say, there you go, there you go.
10175924	10176484	Excellent idea.
10176504	10178486	Puppy, start a thread on the live journal community.
10179102	10186225	and everyone let us know if you would leave the Rewind on Monday or just keep the Thursday one the way it is or whatever.
10186385	10188766	We can always move the Monday Rewind to Tuesday as well.
10188786	10190066	We could just do both of them on Thursday.
10190906	10191947	That's a possibility too.
10192047	10192967	Run them back to back to back.
10193687	10194948	Or Wednesday or whatever.
10195268	10196508	Or Saturday afternoon or something.
10196528	10199309	No, we cannot do it on Saturday afternoon.
10200270	10201710	Is that when Understation Live is up?
10201750	10203431	We want to encourage people to listen to Understation Live.
10203471	10204291	Oh, I didn't realize they were on.
10204571	10205452	I thought they moved to Friday.
10205472	10206652	I thought they were still doing it on Saturday.
10207318	10208078	I thought they moved to Friday.
10208158	10208578	I'll check.
10208758	10209079	I'll check.
10209119	10209499	But you're right.
10209519	10210859	We don't want to interfere with Understation Live.
10210879	10212400	Because we love them.
10212660	10213480	Yeah, I'll check and make sure.
10213900	10214860	I thought they moved to Friday.
10214900	10215200	We'll see.
10216701	10217221	Okay.
10218421	10222403	In other show news, Arcadian reminded me of this.
10222443	10223603	Arcadian42, thank you.
10223763	10224723	I forgot to point this out.
10224763	10229225	But everybody, look at the person next to you and give them a big pat on the back.
10230185	10231225	I don't see some pats on the back.
10232126	10233606	Yes, pat people on the back because...
10234403	10238824	Ladies and gentlemen, this week, Orange Lounge Radio crossed 2,500 total listening hours.
10239204	10240784	Yay!
10240984	10242765	That's the highest we've ever been.
10243125	10243625	Congratulations.
10243645	10244245	We're high.
10244485	10247086	And that's because of a lot of hard work from a lot of people.
10247426	10250346	And some events that happened this month certainly helped.
10250767	10255007	I think we were a Bomani-style side of the week for a while, which really helped the website hit.
10255948	10257508	Our B3 coverage helped a lot, too.
10257588	10258868	And the shows have been doing really well.
10259168	10261069	So the fuck-off shows and everything.
10261109	10262209	So everybody's done a great job.
10263422	10276325	and also I am going to start doing well I'm going to be going to school so I don't know I may have to change the night that I do this but I am going to be doing at least one regular fuck off a week one regular fuck off a week?
10276365	10292448	and I think that this week I might do video game trivia I have to find my CDs or re-download stuff but maybe not this week but next week for sure I'll get all the stuff ready to do music trivia cool very cool
10293673	10294733	and, uh, yeah, it'll be fun.
10294953	10297074	And I'll do a fuck-off show at some point this week, too.
10297114	10297594	Probably later.
10297634	10302995	I tend to do them, like, uh, whenever I'm just, like, here, Friday or Saturday, late night.
10303475	10305295	I need to figure out how to get them to run while I'm doing Ragnarok.
10305915	10306115	Huh?
10306715	10308496	I need to figure out how to get them to do while I'm doing Auro.
10308736	10310976	I am seriously thinking about getting a Ragnarok account.
10311136	10311296	Uh-huh!
10311316	10312096	This week, finally.
10312136	10313617	Play on, play on, play on Chaos.
10315157	10320258	I'm gonna, I'm... To make everybody happy, I'm obviously gonna have to have one character on both.
10320738	10320978	But...
10322555	10324636	But, this is the thing, then I can have two different classes.
10324797	10326538	That's okay, one of them can be, like, my learning.
10326578	10333883	Well, see, I figure when I do my next job class, I'm gonna do it on, um... If I do a merchant, I'm gonna do it on Chaos, so I can buy stuff cheap for my character.
10335003	10339967	But if I do, um, any other job class, I'm gonna do it on, um, on the Loki server.
10340947	10342008	I might do a Sakurai one, though.
10343489	10344409	I started a Sakurai one.
10344570	10350894	Um, there's three character slots for each server, independent to each server, so you can start three classes on each server.
10351054	10351134	Um...
10352114	10360117	And Loki's got technically less people on it at most times because Chaos was the original server, so there's more or a lot of people who were there since the beginning.
10360838	10363859	So, if you want less lag, really there's not much lag on Chaos either.
10364659	10367200	I mean, because they only have like around 5,000 at the most.
10367860	10369641	I don't know, I didn't even think up 5,000, so.
10371442	10377765	Okay, so it, yeah, I mean, it doesn't really matter what server you start on, it's just whichever one has more of your friends on it, go to that one, I guess.
10378545	10378885	There's just
10379617	10380858	I don't know, whatever.
10381479	10386083	I probably won't even end up signing up because, like, you know, I maybe have to get back into PSO.
10389086	10394611	Mine automatically, I remember when you talked about last week that yours auto-canceled, I went and looked at mine and mine auto-canceled too.
10395091	10399475	So I'd like to give a thank you to Sega for being a respectable company enough to do something like that, you know what I mean?
10399516	10401097	Unless they just made it free.
10401457	10402759	Which would be cool as well, but I don't know.
10402959	10403439	I doubt that.
10405700	10406660	Something else I wanted to say, though.
10406800	10408841	We did get a lot of listening hours.
10408941	10414422	However, our rating, our actual rating for the station, has fallen quite a bit in the past week.
10414782	10421424	I have a feeling we're being zero-bombed by another station.
10421804	10422204	I think.
10422664	10423024	I think.
10423104	10425665	I'm just suspecting it, and I'm probably creating conspiracy theories it's going to be there.
10425965	10429206	But I noticed that the rating for another Bomani station...
10431351	10434273	has gone up significantly while ours has gone down.
10434713	10436234	I'm wondering if something's going on there.
10436294	10436714	I don't know.
10437214	10439476	Yeah, that's really unprofessional and very dubious.
10439536	10440356	I don't know if it's true.
10440396	10443278	I'm probably suspecting things I shouldn't be and going places I don't need to go.
10443358	10445299	I wouldn't listen to another station who did that.
10446700	10447140	I wouldn't either.
10448181	10448601	Posers.
10450862	10460588	Oh, I listen to another station, but I have an obligation, you know, not just an obligation to... Well, I hate for their, that other station's thing that, you know, happened to them, because you know what comes around, you know...
10462088	10465389	I need to say right now, it's not under Station Live, obviously.
10465689	10466710	It's not DDR Freak.
10467030	10470691	DDR Freak Radio and Orange Ones Radio kind of have a silent agreement on where we're not going to go.
10470711	10478055	I need to give a very big thank you to the powers that be with DDR Freak Radio for being very considerate of us, too.
10479675	10481076	I think we need to be partners.
10481596	10485838	All of us, Bimani Stations, we need to be partners in this and not snipe each other.
10486468	10487369	Well, yeah.
10487689	10491131	Not just Petty, but all of us are working to promote the games and the music.
10491411	10498194	I hope nobody came in in the middle of this and is thinking that, like, a specific station that we know of has been doing this, because we really don't know.
10498254	10500596	Rob said, again, like, that he doesn't know.
10500676	10502257	He's not interesting.
10502337	10504478	It's just interesting that one goes down and one goes up.
10504498	10505198	It's just interesting.
10505919	10513183	Yeah, and in all honesty, I've looked at a lot of Life 365 stations, and Orange Lounge is, like, really the only entertaining one.
10513223	10513643	I'm sorry.
10514731	10516553	I personally like to listen to talk.
10516573	10521597	If I want to listen to music, I'll just find pictures of the music files somewhere online.
10522438	10526441	But if I want to listen to talk, it's like, Orison is the most interesting talk one.
10526481	10529764	It's definitely more entertaining than any other ones out there.
10530465	10536350	I mean, Under Sundation is like a completely different subject, and that's really cool too, but as far as Bomani is concerned.
10536910	10539092	I consider them to be our parents.
10540633	10541114	So, um...
10542220	10545221	What you can do, now don't vote other stations as zero.
10545261	10545841	That's stupid.
10545861	10546641	You don't need to do that.
10546661	10551683	If you want to check other stations out, we're not total Nazi radio people.
10551723	10553503	Go vote for them however you want to vote.
10553543	10554643	But for us, vote a five.
10555004	10555884	Yes, vote five.
10556404	10557224	There is no choice.
10557284	10559065	So if you have your little live 365 window up.
10559085	10561545	There's other numbers that pretend and don't work, so hit five.
10561605	10566026	If you have your live 365 window up right now, just change that little vote in the bottom to a five, and we would love that.
10566107	10567507	And we'll come to your house and have sex with you.
10567527	10567847	Just kidding.
10568527	10569648	No, we'll send the monkeys.
10570188	10577113	Rob can't see this, because Live365 doesn't supply this kind of technology for him to see the IPs of the people voting.
10577513	10585179	But I can, because I have something that snipes in the middle and finds it, and so I can see who's voting bad, you know, and I will fucking blow up your computer.
10585559	10586860	So don't vote anything low.
10586940	10589082	We'll send our leak team a grad after you.
10590022	10591023	I was just kidding, I can't.
10591843	10592364	I'm a loser.
10592404	10593625	I'm a fucking script kiddie.
10596423	10606629	Well, that being said, our little help us be the high-rated station as opposed to going down the crapper where we've been going recently.
10607029	10608550	I think it's time to wrap up the show.
10608570	10609130	What do you guys say?
10609710	10610010	Sure.
10610030	10610931	What are we going to wrap it up in?
10610971	10611651	Ribbons and bows?
10611911	10613953	We're going to wrap it up in pretty pink paper.
10613973	10615073	Leather and pantyhose.
10615173	10615433	Yes.
10616234	10617034	Okay.
10617154	10618095	Final thought time.
10618115	10619095	Let's start with our guests.
10619356	10621557	LankyStyle, your final thought, please.
10622897	10624738	Bye Bye Bye by NSYNC and DDR.
10624758	10625019	What?
10628297	10629438	RicePrincess, your final thought?
10630038	10631579	Hi, and bye.
10633080	10633960	Loki, your final thought?
10636722	10638143	I'll get these phones to work.
10638523	10639103	It kills me.
10643346	10648588	My final thought is... I don't know.
10648849	10649829	That's my final thought.
10650069	10651070	I just don't know anymore.
10652130	10652451	Jamie?
10653291	10654732	My final thought is give me money.
10656912	10658733	and play Ragnarok on the Chaos Server.
10663155	10664495	Just play Ragnarok.
10667637	10671578	Okay, so, uh, I'm trying to queue up the outro still, sorry.
10671699	10673219	Does anybody have an additional final thought?
10673359	10674100	Yeah, I do.
10674540	10674880	What?
10674940	10677241	My socks are cool, because they have blue stars on them.
10681123	10682523	And my cat's butt stinks.
10683184	10684804	Oh, yay, I love your fortune cookie message.
10685565	10685825	Okay.
10686858	10692041	Um, and the, uh, final word of the show goes to Jamie.
10693762	10698764	The final word of the night is... Crack whore.
10700385	10702807	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10703247	10707089	Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
10707449	10709310	We expect you a nice play again.
10709790	10712572	And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
10714384	10718148	I inherited my father's eyes and my mother's eating disorder.
10720030	10721832	My mother and I have the same eating disorder.
10722173	10732484	She said to me, when I was pregnant with you, I eat only cherry and I think that you are just one big cherry.
10733993	10736754	You are just one big gay kitty!
10745836	10750497	I was on the cover of The Star once and it was for this thing called the Chow Like Cho Diet.
10751717	10754378	I was so fucking racist because they just made this diet up.
10754398	10755198	They didn't consult me.
10755258	10759519	I mean, it was like this total diet that they made up that they said that I went on and all these fake quotes from me.
10760599	10763500	When I was young, I was raised on rice and fish.
10764229	10768355	So when I get heavy, I go back to that natural Asian way of eating.
10769156	10771620	You can almost hear the mandolin in the background.
10773803	10778230	When I was a little girl and I grow up on the rice paddy
10778806	10783547	We don't have any food, because this was before Sally's daughter.
10784208	10800752	So... We are so hungry all the time, and we have no money, and I want to go to the market to buy a chicken head, but I have no money, so I have to sell my finger.
10801372	10805534	But... I... I...
10807322	10821908	was very hungry but I still have tendency to put on weight which is why I really hope that I catch malaria because that is very good way to lose weight quickly, malaria and dysentery.
10826229	10828330	Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.
10844227	10847370	The Afterbirth of Orange Lounge Radio.
10847550	10848570	Here we are.
10873323	10874803	Um, so what's up kids?
10875343	10876444	Anything, uh, extra?
10876524	10877264	Die, monster!
10877564	10878944	You don't belong in this world!
10879824	10882505	You take them souls and make them your slaves!
10883145	10885325	Are you gonna, are you gonna do that as support on Cookie One Week?
10885685	10887646	The same could be said of all religions.
10888506	10889506	Are you guys just gonna act it out?
10889566	10890226	I don't even know it.
10890466	10891986	All I know is the die, monster part.
10892266	10892586	Oh, I can do it.
10892606	10893607	And then the Grim Reaper.
10893727	10895047	The Grim Reaper had the beginning.
10895067	10895487	Do it!
10895587	10895867	Do it!
10896687	10897107	Right now?
10898127	10900708	Actually, there was supposed to be an ending where Maria turned evil.
10901408	10902028	It does just sound
10902375	10903496	The sound file's on the game.
10905136	10908798	She's like, like, who would have thought such a little girl had so much power?
10909399	10910559	You know, but she's like the best.
10913221	10915342	And, um, I like the Grim Reaper part.
10915722	10916783	Ah, hello, God.
10917463	10918243	I love his voice.
10918944	10920304	Okay, do the intro.
10922145	10923886	The dark brief shaft.
10924186	10926207	Do the intro to Castlevania, please.
10926428	10927128	Do it, Brad, do it.
10927148	10928188	I know I'm gonna fuck it up.
10928228	10929209	Come on, do it, do it, do it.
10930546	10933527	Okay, I need to get my, like, wine glass and my Dracula teeth.
10933567	10933927	Come on.
10934067	10934827	I'm so excited.
10936208	10936868	Don't look at me.
10936928	10937388	Everybody look around.
10937408	10938468	I'm not looking at you.
10938488	10939489	Don't look at me.
10939589	10940669	Die, monster.
10941149	10942710	You don't belong in this world.
10943370	10944690	Somebody else has to do the Dracula part.
10945291	10945651	Oh, God.
10946371	10948372	I don't know the Dracula part, so you just have to do your Dracula voice.
10948392	10948972	Okay.
10949992	10953193	It was not by my hand that I was once again given flesh.
10954373	10958575	I was brought here by humans who used to wish to pay me tribute.
10959135	10959635	Tribute?
10960089	10963051	You steal men's souls and make them your slaves.
10963791	10965832	Perhaps the same could be said of all religions.
10966833	10968974	Your words are as empty as your soul.
10969395	10971796	Mankind ill needs a savior such as you.
10972476	10973377	What is a man?
10973877	10974678	For a little wine glass.
10975218	10977059	A miserable little pile of secrets.
10977379	10978080	But enough talk.
10978300	10979040	How about you?
10979060	10981962	Yay, it was beautiful.
10982728	10986630	That is the best dialogue out of any video game ever in the history of mankind.
10986670	10987731	The acting is perfect.
10987771	10988711	I don't care what you think.
10988871	10991573	Loki, can you make a remix using those lines?
10993394	10995495	That's why you wanted me to do it.
10995535	10997756	I knew, I should have known that's why you wanted me to do that.
10998877	11000077	Brad's voiced the game.
11000737	11003959	I've got, I can give you the whole thing in Japanese.
11004139	11005080	Die, monster.
11005100	11006601	Die, monster.
11006801	11010943	I should actually copy off my Japanese one, too, and play it for you.
11011900	11013641	It sounds really, really cool.
11014101	11023244	I might do something like that, but unfortunately, my name starts with an M. What?
11023464	11023964	What?
11024184	11032167	In other words, I'm not a person that also has four letters in their name, begins with a T, ends with a N, and makes stupid remixes.
11032267	11032688	So there.
11034468	11035308	Okay, then I'll do it.
11036749	11038810	Hey, you know what that is backwards?
11038890	11039430	It's Newt.
11042421	11067004	well now I'm gonna make a remix called the beauty of silence silence mix and it's just gonna go the beauty of silence and then like a minute of silence and I'm gonna say see it's beautiful and then like sex noises in the back and kittens getting choked just kidding
11069537	11072898	Oh, do you want to give a plug to going to vote for Shermie?
11074099	11082021	I put Shermie's picture up on RateMyKitten.com, but it's not up there yet, and I actually don't know where her site is for her picture.
11083022	11084122	So she's just on there somewhere.
11085463	11090644	It's a picture of Shermie on Mel's lap, being sleepy and cute.
11093465	11093765	Yay.
11095446	11098387	Okay, so does anybody else have anything they want to say for the wrap-up here?
11098629	11099510	The Afterbirth.
11100631	11100851	Yes.
11101471	11102953	I'm fucking hungry, man.
11103953	11105295	There's a bunch of snack foods up there.
11105315	11106496	I don't want snack foods.
11106536	11107917	I want a meal.
11108437	11109618	No, I just want a meal.
11109678	11111540	I'm tired of eating all these sneaky snacks.
11112380	11113081	Aw, poor thing.
11113862	11114102	I know.
11114142	11114562	Poor thing.
11114602	11115543	You can eat my dick.
11116444	11117625	Oh, God, that's too many calories.
11119647	11120367	Or not.
11121488	11122709	I promise you it's sweet.
11122829	11123690	It's full of fat.
11123770	11124711	And high in fiber.
11128915	11129776	All right, kids.
11130756	11131997	What, did somebody fart or something?
11135600	11136660	Wait, yes, Loki?
11137981	11139623	Loki has something he'd like to share with you all.
11140283	11140823	I'm scared.
11144146	11146107	Um, we just had, like, a bunch of radio silence.
11146908	11147228	I know.
11147248	11148389	Mumble, mumble, mumble.
11148429	11149890	That air is such great radio here.
11149930	11150810	That's bullshit.
11154453	11156214	Oh, are you trying to do the poodle hat thing?
11157950	11159271	You want to play a poodle hat track?
11161873	11164496	Okay, Loki wants to play a poodle hat track for you all.
11165296	11165877	A hat rack?
11166037	11166317	What?
11172583	11173283	It's quiet.
11174044	11174484	Yeah, I know.
11174805	11175765	This is shitty radio.
11176666	11177907	You talk!
11177987	11179148	I do too much talking.
11180349	11182411	People complain that I talk too much, so I'm done.
11182451	11183392	Rod, you talk too much.
