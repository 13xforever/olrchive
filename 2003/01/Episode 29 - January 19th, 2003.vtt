00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
message for you sir! attention! do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex. In this episode...

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Hey, are there any balls down there?

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
That's the biggest berry you've ever seen, Dingleberry.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
What's your favorite scary movie?

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
Showgirls. Absolute frightful. What's yours?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Now's the time when Scrockets pay me dogs!

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
I know kung fu.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
No! What I expect for Spanish expression is Hindu.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Hey!

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Shut up! Where's my gun? This is not a boomstick!

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Come on, girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.600
Look, I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

01:30.600 --> 01:33.460
What kind of working man would find that funny?

01:33.460 --> 01:35.500
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:35.500 --> 01:42.900
We are live, and this is episode number 29 for January 19th of 2003.

01:42.900 --> 01:52.200
You're tuned into the B-e-e-e-e-mani scene's most drunken radio station of all things b-money.

01:52.200 --> 01:55.700
My name is Rob Roberts, and you may know me as Sky.

01:55.700 --> 01:58.900
Thank you for joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the Happiest

01:58.900 --> 02:04.060
Bunny on the Farm, Ms. Jamie Summers.

02:04.060 --> 02:05.060
That was last week.

02:05.060 --> 02:08.980
You know her better as Dark Seqra?

02:08.980 --> 02:14.100
In that corner, say hello to our Tech Massa Loki.

02:14.100 --> 02:17.420
And with us tonight will be some special guests joining us a little bit later.

02:17.420 --> 02:18.420
There's nobody else here yet.

02:18.420 --> 02:20.460
It's just the three of us, feeling the love.

02:20.460 --> 02:23.660
We don't have a Dave here.

02:23.660 --> 02:26.660
We don't have a Dave here yet, and my drinking partner isn't here yet.

02:26.660 --> 02:27.660
Yes, the rumor...

02:27.660 --> 02:28.660
I can't drink.

02:28.660 --> 02:31.660
The rumors are true, we're going to be doing some drinking on the show tonight,

02:31.660 --> 02:34.660
except unfortunately, Jamie's not going to be able to drink.

02:34.660 --> 02:37.660
I mean, I have no doubt that I'd be able to drink excessive amounts

02:37.660 --> 02:39.660
if it had not affected my ability.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.660
Even so, I'm not a major idiot.

02:42.660 --> 02:47.660
Because I have a neat little thing outside that will prevent me from driving,

02:47.660 --> 02:49.660
which I'll tell anyone about later.

02:49.660 --> 02:50.660
Alright, yeah, we'll talk a little bit more about...

02:50.660 --> 02:51.660
I'm going to Bush.

02:51.660 --> 02:54.660
We'll talk a little bit more about the drinking when we come back for our first break.

02:54.660 --> 02:56.660
Can you play me some Initial D?

02:56.660 --> 02:59.660
I will play you some Initial D music during this break.

02:59.660 --> 03:02.660
We'll also play some Guacamole Del Taco, how's that sound?

03:02.660 --> 03:03.660
Sure.

03:03.660 --> 03:06.660
And some other stuff too.

03:06.660 --> 03:09.660
Any Initial D that I'm talking about may need things.

03:09.660 --> 03:10.660
Any other opening thoughts?

03:10.660 --> 03:11.660
I don't have much.

03:11.660 --> 03:15.660
Alright, we'll be back in a little bit. Enjoy.

04:11.660 --> 04:12.160
Hey!

04:14.860 --> 04:15.360
Hey!

04:18.060 --> 04:18.560
Hey!

04:21.260 --> 04:21.760
Hey!

06:51.760 --> 06:58.760
If you feel my heart, what you're feeling is mine, and it means you better stay behind

06:58.760 --> 07:04.760
It's the sense of your soul, that you tried to relieve, never until your heart functions

07:04.760 --> 07:10.760
Feel it, feel it baby, feel the fire, it's coming deep inside me

07:10.760 --> 07:17.760
Listen, listen honey, listen to, come listen to you, listen to the heartbeat

07:17.760 --> 07:21.760
Oh oh oh, you better think you can turn right now

07:21.760 --> 07:24.760
10 to the heartbeat, and let it go

07:24.760 --> 07:27.760
You can fall, let your body flow

07:27.760 --> 07:29.760
10 to the heart beat

07:29.760 --> 07:33.760
Oh oh oh, you better think you can turn right now

07:33.760 --> 07:37.760
10 to the heartbeat, and let it go

07:37.760 --> 08:06.040
Hi Ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

08:06.040 --> 08:10.040
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

08:10.040 --> 08:16.040
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

08:16.040 --> 08:24.040
Howdy ho kids, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and as we mentioned last week,

08:24.040 --> 08:27.040
some of us have, well I guess maybe I'm the only one that has a three day weekend this

08:27.040 --> 08:32.040
week. My company celebrates Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, so I don't have to work

08:32.040 --> 08:36.040
So, I'm sorry. Hey, it ain't my fault my company rules. Yours sucks.

08:36.040 --> 08:40.040
Mine feeds us. Mine caters... caters, uh, Chevy's and...

08:40.040 --> 08:44.040
Yeah, you get barbecues. We don't get shit, so shut it, lady.

08:44.040 --> 08:48.040
But, uh, we decided that we would do some

08:48.040 --> 08:52.040
drinking tonight. Except, um, I'm really the only one that's able to drink

08:52.040 --> 08:53.040
because Jamie has to work tomorrow, and...

08:53.040 --> 08:54.040
I'm driving.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.040
You wanna tell everybody your big news?

08:55.040 --> 08:58.040
Okay, first of all, I don't get hangovers, so I could drink.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.040
Alright, alright.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.040
Okay.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.040
I do. I'm a lightweight, as you're going to find out tonight.

09:02.040 --> 09:06.040
You have seen how drunk I have gotten, and I've never had a hangover yet.

09:06.040 --> 09:10.040
I have a car, and it owns all of you. Yay!

09:10.040 --> 09:16.040
It's the seafoam aquamarine blue, cheeky color, 93 Toyota Tercel two-door.

09:16.040 --> 09:19.040
It's a DX. I'm going to have a 2 added before it.

09:19.040 --> 09:27.040
Anyway, it's black inside, and it has a CD player, so I instantly went and burned off CDs of Eurobeat.

09:27.040 --> 09:32.600
But my car is like awesome, but since I drove over here, actually I gave up going to the

09:32.600 --> 09:36.800
con just so I could drive my car.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.920
Because my car made me feel happy.

09:38.920 --> 09:42.360
Jamie got a car!

09:42.360 --> 09:47.280
And because I'm driving tonight, I'm not going to be doing any drinking, however because

09:47.280 --> 09:51.400
we've got three hours, I'm going to do a shot in honor of the night.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.460
We're going to do one shot together.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.800
By then, I will have peed it out or whatever.

09:55.800 --> 10:01.200
Now we have to tell everybody, because we're radio hosts, drink responsibly, we're being

10:01.200 --> 10:06.320
smart in how we're drinking here, the show's done out of the spare bedroom of my house

10:06.320 --> 10:07.320
so I don't have to go anywhere.

10:07.320 --> 10:10.400
Yeah, I'm chasing my suntan oil with Propel.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.880
Jamie's going to be letting it wear off, she's going to do a one-shot, Loki's not drinking

10:13.880 --> 10:17.400
at all, he's going to babysit.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.520
And then Brad and Irene will be here in a little while, and Brad's going to drink too,

10:20.520 --> 10:21.520
and Irene is his driver.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.080
I'm expecting that Rob's going to eventually assault Brad.

10:24.080 --> 10:29.080
Brad and I are the... assault him with what? My CAC?

10:29.080 --> 10:31.080
Yes! Yes!

10:31.080 --> 10:32.080
If you will drink some...

10:32.080 --> 10:34.080
Excuse me while I whip this out.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.080
Anyway, okay, so here we go.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.080
All right, first...

10:37.080 --> 10:38.080
A toast.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.080
And only a shot.

10:39.080 --> 10:41.080
Now, I've never taken Malibu rum just straight up.

10:41.080 --> 10:42.080
I always mix it with something.

10:42.080 --> 10:43.080
I've never had it at all.

10:43.080 --> 10:47.080
This is pretty bad. Okay, here we go.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.080
Dude, that was weak.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.080
Oh.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.080
Very coconutty.

10:51.080 --> 10:52.080
That was it?

10:52.080 --> 10:53.080
Yeah, it was kind of weak, wasn't it?

10:53.080 --> 10:55.080
It was really weak. It was yummy.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.080
It's yummy.

10:59.080 --> 11:00.080
It doesn't burn to me.

11:00.080 --> 11:02.080
It tastes like burning.

11:02.080 --> 11:03.080
It tastes like burning.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.080
I swear, now I know what suntan oil tastes like.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.080
Ugh. God.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.080
Ew.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.080
Ew, that left the nastiest after days.

11:10.080 --> 11:12.080
Yes, please. That left the nastiest after days.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.080
I thought it was okay.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.080
Ooh!

11:15.080 --> 11:16.080
This stuff was weak.

11:16.080 --> 11:19.080
You're about to find out I'm a fucking lightweight, by the way, too.

11:19.080 --> 11:20.080
How many, how many what?

11:20.080 --> 11:21.080
Where's the bottle?

11:21.080 --> 11:22.080
The bottle of what? Malibu?

11:22.080 --> 11:34.200
Malibu yeah over here 21% okay excuse me that tasted like five like drinking a

11:34.200 --> 11:39.120
wine cooler do that this would be really yummy with vanilla coke I bet it would

11:39.120 --> 11:44.000
too let me let's let's do that um I think I got president's day off okay I

11:44.000 --> 11:48.200
don't have president's day off bitch I might be able to take it off we'll see

11:48.200 --> 11:49.200
We'll see.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.200
Alright.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.200
I'll drink with you.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.200
I'm gonna do a floating holiday.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.200
Anyway.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.200
Oh yeah!

11:54.200 --> 11:55.200
Hi!

11:55.200 --> 11:56.200
We're a BamaniTalk radio show, aren't we?

11:56.200 --> 11:57.200
Yeah.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.200
What's new, you guys?

11:58.200 --> 11:59.200
How was your week?

11:59.200 --> 12:00.200
What'd you do this week?

12:00.200 --> 12:02.800
I think my insides are getting a tan.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.200
Your insides are getting a tan?

12:04.200 --> 12:05.200
How?

12:05.200 --> 12:06.200
Yeah, I drink some tannyl.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.200
In your big fluorescent light.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.200
Or whatever.

12:09.200 --> 12:12.800
Kind of just bright light bulbs.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.760
This show is gonna go to hell much faster than ever before.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.100
Did you enjoy playing the new DDR Extreme?

12:18.100 --> 12:22.380
we have a new Extreme Machine here locally? No. No, I was in pain, remember? Oh, that's

12:22.380 --> 12:25.300
right. I'm sorry to hear that. Which is going to be part of my Fuck You of the Week. I'm

12:25.300 --> 12:31.540
sorry to hear that. Loki, tell us about the new machine and the unlock code that ended

12:31.540 --> 12:35.980
up getting released this week. What happened with that? Konami released, or actually, Bomani

12:35.980 --> 12:40.460
Cell said that someone had hacked the code and then later on, about, I don't know, about

12:40.460 --> 12:44.580
five minutes later, someone's like, oh yeah, Konami just faxed in the code, you know, to

13:14.580 --> 13:18.580
germania only course with at least 100 seconds and across the nightmare in it

13:18.580 --> 13:23.220
so that's kind of cool and um other than that we've also been having

13:23.220 --> 13:26.620
we've been having slight problems with the machine lately

13:26.620 --> 13:30.860
and the problems are that machine keeps freezing up during middle songs

13:30.860 --> 13:34.580
max 2 did that same shit though didn't it? where like after you play a certain set of songs

13:34.580 --> 13:38.260
like one of the internet rankings? no this has nothing to do with internet rankings

13:38.260 --> 13:41.620
that was a glitch in the whole thing this has to do with like a smudge on the CD

13:41.620 --> 13:45.620
You'll play a song and all of a sudden, boom, it'll freeze up.

13:45.620 --> 13:50.620
I don't know if it's a smudge on the CD because if that were the case, the music would skip because the music's on the CD.

13:50.620 --> 13:54.620
What happens is the music keeps going and the steps freeze.

13:54.620 --> 13:55.620
Yikes.

13:55.620 --> 14:03.620
So that's a pretty nasty bug there and they're going to be hopefully reinstalling it on Monday and hopefully that'll fix the problem.

14:03.620 --> 14:10.620
I wonder if that's happening at other places or if it's just specific to our local arcade.

14:10.620 --> 14:12.620
JB told me that, it happened to him.

14:12.620 --> 14:14.620
Don't!

14:14.620 --> 14:16.620
So, yeah, I don't know.

14:16.620 --> 14:22.620
Other than that, I got yet another bonus from my company.

14:22.620 --> 14:24.620
Another $800.

14:24.620 --> 14:26.620
Are you going to buy your machine yet?

14:26.620 --> 14:29.620
No, I'm not buying my machine, I'm paying off my credit card.

14:29.620 --> 14:33.620
Paying off my credit card and getting my savings account where it should be.

14:33.620 --> 14:43.620
And so, you know, hopefully, hopefully that will fix things, you know, financially with me and make me financially stable.

14:43.620 --> 14:49.620
I see Slinky saying that our Vigal machine has the same problem. That's not looking good.

14:49.620 --> 14:50.620
Surprise! They have a broken machine.

14:50.620 --> 14:55.620
Well, no, still though, if this is a widespread problem, I mean, defective DDR Extreme copies going out.

14:55.620 --> 14:59.620
Well, gee, Konami being lazy? No. Never.

14:59.620 --> 15:05.620
Remember the issue with the six-town seven-style videos?

15:05.620 --> 15:10.620
Oh, yeah, that's right.

15:10.620 --> 15:15.620
So, that kind of sucks, but it happens every now and then.

15:15.620 --> 15:16.620
It's no big deal.

15:16.620 --> 15:19.620
But other than that, with my money, I went and bought a GameCube.

15:19.620 --> 15:22.620
And with that GameCube, I also got Animal Crossing.

15:22.620 --> 15:23.620
Yay!

15:23.620 --> 15:25.620
Welcome to the crack world addiction.

15:25.620 --> 15:31.620
So now I've joined the cult of Animal Crossing, in my wonderfully named town of Big Cock.

15:31.620 --> 15:35.620
It was my girlfriend's idea, okay? Not mine.

15:35.620 --> 15:36.620
Oh my.

15:36.620 --> 15:39.620
We were thinking of something to name it, and it was funny, so...

15:39.620 --> 15:43.620
We named it Big Cock, and it makes for some really funny dialogue.

15:43.620 --> 15:46.620
If you two have a baby, you know, five years down the road, you gonna name your baby Big Cock?

15:46.620 --> 15:48.620
No.

15:48.620 --> 15:56.620
But, uh, yeah, so that's the name of our town, and it's pretty cool. Pearl's a bitch.

15:56.620 --> 15:58.620
Yeah, she is.

15:58.620 --> 16:00.620
Well, she left our town.

16:00.620 --> 16:05.620
So I don't like her, and, yeah, so that's what I've been playing, playing Animal Crossing.

16:05.620 --> 16:13.620
Oh, and another thing, I found out, I finished testing my DDR Max 2 edit machine code thing.

16:13.620 --> 16:19.340
Apparently the number is not a pattern at all and it's randomly generated so no I'm not gonna test all

16:19.860 --> 16:26.780
16,000 combinations because I would take forever dope and it'd be a waste of my time and it's and it's coming out in April

16:26.780 --> 16:28.780
So what do I give a shit about that? So

16:30.660 --> 16:34.540
But I'm sure that'll be news will ever be giving out later yes

16:35.860 --> 16:37.860
I'm sorry, Jamie

16:37.860 --> 16:40.620
That's when my birthday is and someone can buy me something.

16:40.620 --> 16:47.100
Yes, Max 2 for the Japanese system is coming out April and of course the U.S. version is

16:47.100 --> 16:50.060
coming out around November, so just like...

16:50.060 --> 16:51.060
A little bit delayed.

16:51.060 --> 16:52.220
It's a little late.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.220
Just like DDRUSA.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.220
A late birth.

16:54.220 --> 17:00.020
And you'll hear it here first, this is a few of the tracks that are going to be in there.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.020
Okay.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.020
You've got...

17:02.020 --> 17:04.100
Now how do you know this, Mr. Man?

17:04.100 --> 17:05.100
How do I know this?

17:05.100 --> 17:06.100
Well, because they're done already.

17:06.100 --> 17:12.100
They were going to be in DDR Max USA, but they were like, no, we're going to cut it out and put them in the next one.

17:12.100 --> 17:17.100
So we've got Nemesis, Keep on Lifting, and...

17:17.100 --> 17:19.100
This is a weird name born from 6 style.

17:19.100 --> 17:20.100
Big Black Hawk.

17:20.100 --> 17:21.100
No, it's not Big Black Hawk.

17:21.100 --> 17:24.100
Speed Mix.

17:24.100 --> 17:26.100
M-2 Step.

17:26.100 --> 17:28.100
M-2 Step 101 or something like that.

17:28.100 --> 17:29.100
Alright.

17:29.100 --> 17:32.100
And if they're not in Max 2, then you never heard it here.

17:32.100 --> 17:33.100
Ain't it good.

17:33.100 --> 17:34.100
Ain't it good.

17:34.100 --> 17:37.100
You don't end up in Max 2? You never heard it here. You didn't say anything about it.

17:37.100 --> 17:39.100
Yeah, I didn't say anything.

17:39.100 --> 17:48.100
But Max Japan, I bet you anything Max Japan is going to have that, Max 2 Japan will have that drop the bomb remix as an unlocked track.

17:48.100 --> 17:55.100
And what else? It's going to have, because you know how you can, yes, the Dynamite Rave remix, thank you Jimmy.

17:55.100 --> 18:03.160
Because you know how you can sort the list in Xtreme by game?

18:03.160 --> 18:06.620
You can see that there's the one that's songs from home's versions?

18:06.620 --> 18:10.580
Well, they have like the drop the bomb mix in there and they have the dynamite rave one

18:10.580 --> 18:12.780
in there, but they don't have the true colors mix.

18:12.780 --> 18:13.780
Because it's unlockable.

18:13.780 --> 18:14.780
Oh, is it?

18:14.780 --> 18:15.780
It's unlockable.

18:15.780 --> 18:17.500
Same, dynamite rave's not in there yet either.

18:17.500 --> 18:18.500
That's also unlockable.

18:18.500 --> 18:19.640
Oh, well shit, I'll be damned.

18:19.640 --> 18:24.060
And the only one, do it right, the two-step version is going to be in there.

18:24.060 --> 18:31.060
But since those are all supposedly home version unlocked songs, that would mean they need to be in a Japanese home release, so I bet we'll be seeing those in Max 2 Japan.

18:31.060 --> 18:39.060
Probably, well not necessarily though, because look at AM3P 303 bass mix, that's not in there yet.

18:39.060 --> 18:43.060
But it might, that might be another one! Ah! Ah!

18:43.060 --> 18:49.060
But, you know, I don't know, I hope they release something new instead of all this rehash shit, you know.

18:49.060 --> 18:53.060
Yeah, I want to see some new shit too.

18:53.060 --> 18:55.060
Go to the bathroom.

18:55.060 --> 18:57.060
Gross!

18:57.060 --> 19:01.060
Okay. What's new in the Sim world, Loki, as long as we're talking to you

19:01.060 --> 19:03.060
at the start of this show here?

19:03.060 --> 19:06.060
Well, other than my site coming up next week,

19:06.060 --> 19:09.060
I know it was supposed to be this week, but we ran into script issues with their...

19:09.060 --> 19:11.060
Yeah, right. You were playing Animal Crossing all week.

19:11.060 --> 19:16.060
No, I wasn't. So, we ran into problems with that, and it should be coming up next week.

19:16.060 --> 19:20.060
Although, I don't know. I'm debating, because our tech people at work

19:20.060 --> 19:23.840
work or going through all of our computers and deleting all non third-party stuff. And

19:23.840 --> 19:27.640
I have all my stuff hidden but he hasn't quite gotten to my computer yet. So I have to wait

19:27.640 --> 19:31.760
for him to come by and like supposedly delete everything so I can reinstall everything and

19:31.760 --> 19:36.520
then get back to what I was doing. But I have to wait for that to happen before I can, you

19:36.520 --> 19:40.920
know, I don't know, I could probably upload everything right away but they're just being

19:40.920 --> 19:48.040
super anal because our HR department thinks for some reason that background screen savers

19:48.040 --> 19:51.740
and like other stuff like that cause viruses because they're dumbasses and don't know shit

19:51.740 --> 19:54.740
about computers.

19:54.740 --> 19:58.740
So yeah, hopefully everything should be coming up.

19:58.740 --> 20:00.580
The site's already sort of up right now.

20:00.580 --> 20:06.700
I mean, you can email me to get your account set up so you can upload shit, but it's going

20:06.700 --> 20:16.120
to be www.willddrforfood.net slash leachfromloki.

20:16.120 --> 20:18.020
So definitely go check that out.

20:18.020 --> 20:23.560
Other than that, you've got Bomani Cell keeps releasing more DDR Extreme stuff, although

20:23.560 --> 20:27.340
they're being kind of anal about it, much like last week.

20:27.340 --> 20:32.280
Recently they released the MP3s for Dance Dance Revolution and Paranoia Survivor Max,

20:32.280 --> 20:35.120
which you'll probably hear later on the show.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.500
Other than that, also check out Bomani Sims.

20:37.500 --> 20:40.660
You'll see a lot of stuff that, you know, other people are releasing on there if you've

20:40.660 --> 20:44.820
missed it on, you know, say DDR Mania X, which is also down right now, but the forums are

20:44.820 --> 20:45.820
still working.

20:45.820 --> 20:54.820
DDR East Coast Invasion, I haven't looked at today. I don't think anything is going on there, and that's pretty much it. Not too much.

20:55.820 --> 20:57.820
But yeah.

20:58.820 --> 21:02.820
While Loki was telling us about what's going on in the Bimani world...

21:02.820 --> 21:05.820
I was about to do a shot of this stuff that looks like wall touching.

21:05.820 --> 21:08.900
Jamie was sitting there going, I'm hot.

21:08.900 --> 21:12.980
And she wasn't talking about, you know, just like, oh damn, you know, I got it, I'm sexy,

21:12.980 --> 21:16.620
I'm too sexy for this show.

21:16.620 --> 21:17.700
And I was feeling her face.

21:17.700 --> 21:21.340
She was, she is indeed a little hot from that shot, so.

21:21.340 --> 21:22.860
I always get warm with my fresh...

21:22.860 --> 21:27.300
Put the thermometer against your face and see what you measure.

21:27.300 --> 21:28.300
This one?

21:28.300 --> 21:29.300
Yeah.

21:29.300 --> 21:32.860
I feel retarded.

21:32.860 --> 21:34.260
You look retarded, it's okay.

21:34.260 --> 21:37.260
Here, oh, but it feels nice because I'm hot and then it's cold.

21:37.260 --> 21:41.260
God damn it, Rob, these things burn at a thousand degrees. I feel like burning heat.

21:41.260 --> 21:44.260
While she's doing that, I'm going to take a shot. I'm going to do my next shot here.

21:44.260 --> 21:45.260
Hot damn.

21:45.260 --> 21:46.260
This is some hot damn.

21:46.260 --> 21:49.260
So, cheers. I'm going to toast Loki's water here.

21:49.260 --> 21:52.260
Well, oh wait, it looks like a wall tussin.

21:55.260 --> 21:56.260
Oh!

21:56.260 --> 21:57.260
Ha ha ha ha!

21:57.260 --> 22:00.260
Woo! Right now, I'm currently pointing and laughing at Rob.

22:00.260 --> 22:01.260
Oh, wow!

22:01.260 --> 22:03.260
He sounds like a woman.

22:03.260 --> 22:04.260
Shut up!

22:04.260 --> 22:07.260
Now you sound like you're thirteen.

22:07.260 --> 22:12.260
It tastes like twenty cinnamon Jolly Ranchers all at once.

22:12.260 --> 22:13.260
Ewww.

22:13.260 --> 22:16.420
That other thing looks like butter.

22:16.420 --> 22:17.420
Like butter.

22:17.420 --> 22:18.420
Butter.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.420
Crack, crack, butter.

22:20.420 --> 22:23.780
I shouldn't be drinking so much until Brad and Irene get here.

22:23.780 --> 22:24.780
Oh well.

22:24.780 --> 22:27.540
You guys are going to have to carry this show once I pass out.

22:27.540 --> 22:28.540
So enjoy.

22:28.540 --> 22:32.660
No, I should make a run to Walgreens and get you stuff.

22:32.660 --> 22:34.660
You've been drinking young lady, you can't drive.

22:34.660 --> 22:36.660
I'll go in an hour.

22:36.660 --> 22:37.660
You'll go in an hour.

22:37.660 --> 22:40.660
Make Brad and Irene go when they get here before they start drinking.

22:40.660 --> 22:46.660
Yeah, I want another two liter of Pepsi and a bag of pretzels so I can get sick again.

22:46.660 --> 22:49.660
I'll make them get maraschino cherries.

22:49.660 --> 22:51.660
And we'll soak them in the Malibu.

22:51.660 --> 22:55.660
You know what sucks is when I get really drunk I start making out with everybody, but y'all are prudes.

22:55.660 --> 22:57.660
So...

22:57.660 --> 23:00.660
No, I think it's that we're both taken.

23:00.660 --> 23:01.660
That too.

23:01.660 --> 23:05.660
No, I know of it. You should have seen this one New Year's party I went to.

23:05.660 --> 23:09.660
I got to see Rob make out with a girl.

23:09.660 --> 23:13.660
Shut up.

23:13.660 --> 23:17.660
Ewww.

23:17.660 --> 23:21.660
This is going to be funny because we're going to get lots of blackmail material on Rob.

23:21.660 --> 23:25.660
No you're not. I'm going to delete this episode. It's never going to air again.

23:25.660 --> 23:29.660
It'll be the long lost episode. It's going the way of the tape that scanned

23:29.660 --> 23:30.660
episode.

23:30.660 --> 23:31.660
That's alright.

23:31.660 --> 23:32.660
We know that's...

23:32.660 --> 23:33.660
How hot is your face?

23:33.660 --> 23:34.660
How...

23:34.660 --> 23:35.660
Let's see.

23:35.660 --> 23:36.900
Jamie measures in at...

23:36.900 --> 23:37.900
Oh!

23:37.900 --> 23:40.420
She's off the scale!

23:40.420 --> 23:41.420
She's off 86.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.320
86 is as high as it goes.

23:43.320 --> 23:44.320
She's hotter than that.

23:44.320 --> 23:46.420
I think you need to get her thermometer.

23:46.420 --> 23:48.260
That makes sense, but you know.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.260
This one works better.

23:50.260 --> 23:51.260
Okay.

23:51.260 --> 23:52.260
Oh!

23:52.260 --> 23:54.260
She put it down her cleavage.

23:54.260 --> 23:57.380
This one sucks.

23:57.380 --> 23:59.260
Anyway.

23:59.260 --> 24:02.540
You're getting sakura boopie action on this show.

24:02.540 --> 24:05.060
I didn't show my boobs, hello.

24:05.060 --> 24:06.500
You haven't drunk enough yet.

24:06.500 --> 24:10.420
And I'm not gonna.

24:10.420 --> 24:14.580
Okay yeah, um, what else can we talk about that's Bimani related?

24:14.580 --> 24:19.100
Well let's see, I gotta kinda cover the, carry the show here.

24:19.100 --> 24:22.660
Just remember the Shaft Live coverage you had to do all by yourself.

24:22.660 --> 24:25.100
I know, that's awful.

24:25.100 --> 24:29.100
Anyways, here's the big stuff that's coming up that happened.

24:29.100 --> 24:35.100
They're starting now testing for Guitar Freaks 9 and Drummania 8.

24:35.100 --> 24:38.100
Wow, it's the same goddamn game with new numbers.

24:38.100 --> 24:44.100
But it's got the cool little thingy with the cards that no one's ever going to get.

24:44.100 --> 24:45.100
A neat font.

24:45.100 --> 24:50.100
Yeah, it's purty looking, and they changed the names to GF and DM.

24:50.100 --> 24:56.580
No, no, no, no, it needs to be Gitadora, like 4th and 3rd.

24:56.580 --> 24:57.580
You know what though?

24:57.580 --> 25:01.220
At AI, they have the power-up versions, they're supposed to have the neat little initial do

25:01.220 --> 25:03.660
you want to be card things, and they don't have them at AI.

25:03.660 --> 25:04.660
I know, I was sad.

25:04.660 --> 25:05.660
That made me sad.

25:05.660 --> 25:10.100
Oh yeah, I know, and I've talked about this like three weeks in a row.

25:10.100 --> 25:13.740
Brian's out, he'll hold the door, Jamie.

25:13.740 --> 25:16.380
I know, I didn't get another card.

25:16.380 --> 25:19.780
I know, I need another card to mate with my derby owner's cards.

25:19.780 --> 25:22.580
Okay, my thing is full, and I can't...

25:22.580 --> 25:28.260
Someone, one of our Bay Area listeners, buy me one of those card binders for my horses,

25:28.260 --> 25:32.820
and I'll think kindly of you.

25:32.820 --> 25:37.660
Um, see other stuff in the world since I gotta kinda stretch this out, whatever it is.

25:37.660 --> 25:40.860
Okay, wait, I wanna know something about Guitar Freak's knife and drum idiot.

25:40.860 --> 25:42.440
There's a song in there called I'm a Loser.

25:42.440 --> 25:43.700
Is that the Beatles song?

25:43.700 --> 25:45.180
Fuck, it's probably not.

25:45.180 --> 25:47.180
I'm a loser.

25:47.180 --> 25:48.180
Nah, I don't think so.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.180
I'm a loser.

25:50.180 --> 25:51.180
What's that?

25:51.180 --> 25:54.180
From the concert I went to last night.

25:54.180 --> 25:55.180
Oh yeah, how was the concert?

25:55.180 --> 25:57.180
Jamie, tell us about the concert you went to last night.

25:57.180 --> 26:00.180
It was so fucking hot.

26:00.180 --> 26:02.180
You gotta tell the listening audience what that was.

26:02.180 --> 26:08.180
Okay, I went to a show at the Crest last night, which started off with Honey Spot, which

26:08.180 --> 26:09.180
was pretty cool.

26:09.180 --> 26:12.180
The lead singer was Spaz, and then the Lil' Nots, and they were awesome.

26:12.180 --> 26:17.140
them. And then Ghost of the Robot, which is, I don't know if anyone's Buffy fans out there,

26:17.140 --> 26:23.260
but it's the band that James Marsters has. And that was a really good show. He was, of

26:23.260 --> 26:27.100
course, really sexy. And everybody decided to go up front. And I'm like, fuck going up

26:27.100 --> 26:32.140
front, because you know what? I ate eight, like, ten penguins. So I was going through

26:32.140 --> 26:36.140
caffeine shock at the time and decided to sit there where I was. I got up this morning,

26:36.140 --> 26:40.020
I was going to go to the convention to see him, but that started at 4.10. And I had to

26:40.020 --> 26:44.100
to be here at five, okay? So I wasn't going to have time to enjoy myself in the dealer's

26:44.100 --> 26:48.900
room, I didn't want to deal with that. So, um, I skipped out on that, sold my ticket

26:48.900 --> 26:54.300
to my friend Krista, went out for breakfast. How much were tickets to the sci-fi convention?

26:54.300 --> 26:58.460
Twenty-five a day. Dang. And I don't want to give- But it was supposed to have Captain

26:58.460 --> 27:08.460
Janeway of the Starship Voyager, I'm Captain Janeway, warp drive! No. But, you know, it

27:08.460 --> 27:15.460
it was just, it was just, uh-uh. I decided against it. So how about Dijinci instead?

27:16.100 --> 27:21.100
Captain Janeway should have been, like, ejected into space right when the show started.

27:21.100 --> 27:25.140
No, you can't eject Captain Janeway into space!

27:25.140 --> 27:27.260
She was a cool captain, but she did not have the Picard factor.

27:27.260 --> 27:34.100
What are you talking about? She's, like, she could have been bald and manlier, and she

27:34.100 --> 27:36.940
just needed to be bald and she would have had it down.

27:36.940 --> 27:40.940
It was Picard in a fucking wig. That's what it was.

27:40.940 --> 27:43.940
No. She was cool.

27:43.940 --> 27:52.940
I can't believe we're actually talking Star Trek on this show. I mean, if we weren't like the biggest dorks on the planet already, I think that just brought our show to an all-time new low.

27:52.940 --> 27:58.940
Now, Picard and Janeway had a baby. What would that look like?

27:58.940 --> 28:02.940
It'd be Jengard, or something like that.

28:02.940 --> 28:03.940
Pick way.

28:03.940 --> 28:04.940
Pick your nose.

28:04.940 --> 28:05.940
Isn't that a store?

28:05.940 --> 28:06.940
Picking way?

28:06.940 --> 28:07.940
I don't know.

28:07.940 --> 28:08.940
I'm looking way.

28:08.940 --> 28:11.940
Okay, I'm going to do another shot.

28:11.940 --> 28:12.940
How's that sound?

28:12.940 --> 28:13.940
Too buttery.

28:13.940 --> 28:14.940
That's too late.

28:14.940 --> 28:16.260
I already poured me a shot of hot damn.

28:16.260 --> 28:17.260
We're going to do another.

28:17.260 --> 28:18.260
Pour some butter stuff in it.

28:18.260 --> 28:19.260
I'm not going to mix.

28:19.260 --> 28:20.260
That's going to be nasty.

28:20.260 --> 28:21.660
Like hot butter.

28:21.660 --> 28:23.660
Hot buttery nipple sex.

28:23.660 --> 28:24.660
Hold on.

28:24.660 --> 28:25.660
Lovely.

28:25.660 --> 28:26.660
Okay.

28:26.660 --> 28:27.660
Here's another shot of hot damn.

28:27.660 --> 28:28.660
Make it slurpy.

28:28.660 --> 28:29.660
Make it slurpy?

28:29.660 --> 28:32.420
Make it slurpy.

28:32.420 --> 28:39.420
good radio

28:42.940 --> 28:43.540
oh my

28:43.540 --> 28:46.580
I wanna smell the better stuff

28:46.580 --> 28:49.820
oh that shit is nasty, fuck

28:49.820 --> 28:54.580
you slurped it

28:54.580 --> 28:57.100
my mouth's on fire

28:57.100 --> 28:59.180
his mouth's on fire

28:59.180 --> 29:00.180
Hee hee.

29:00.180 --> 29:03.340
Oh God, this is good.

29:03.340 --> 29:04.340
So…

29:04.340 --> 29:07.240
Does it smell like Werther's or good too?

29:07.240 --> 29:09.000
I'm trying to push the show along.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Yeah.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.100
It does smell like Werther's.

29:11.100 --> 29:12.100
Aren't they good, man?

29:12.100 --> 29:13.500
Do they smell good?

29:13.500 --> 29:14.980
It smells like Werther's.

29:14.980 --> 29:16.860
It's… it…

29:16.860 --> 29:17.860
Oh.

29:17.860 --> 29:21.900
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

29:21.900 --> 29:22.900
No.

29:22.900 --> 29:25.300
The Butterscotch stuff tastes like candy.

29:25.300 --> 29:27.720
It tastes like liquid candy things.

29:27.720 --> 29:33.880
so check the proof on hot damn I think it's a hundred it says hot damn 100 yeah

29:33.880 --> 29:44.520
it's a hundred proof no and I I cannot hold liquor for shit you're not supposed

29:44.520 --> 29:49.160
to be drinking anymore all right fine

29:50.160 --> 29:54.840
Jamie's got to call a taxi I want some of this stuff this stuff says yummy you

29:54.840 --> 30:01.840
like candy. I can't believe you've never had butterscotch snaps.

30:03.460 --> 30:09.460
So other stuff in the bimani world. There are some tournaments coming up. I want

30:09.460 --> 30:11.760
to talk about tournaments. Oh good, because I don't know jack about these.

30:11.760 --> 30:15.780
We need to be playing FEMA Flowjack Mr. Junk Remix.

30:15.780 --> 30:19.960
Do we even have that? Was it on one of your pre-shows? I think I do. Okay, I want to talk

30:19.960 --> 30:23.940
about upcoming tournaments, because at least in the Bay Area, and I apologize because I

30:23.940 --> 30:27.500
I know this is a national show, but I don't know much about what's going on on the East

30:27.500 --> 30:28.500
Coast.

30:28.500 --> 30:34.020
If you want to send me private messages, if you want to plug a tournament, send me a private

30:34.020 --> 30:36.660
message, I'll plug it for you in the chat room.

30:36.660 --> 30:41.580
If you aren't in the chat room, just visit our webpage, orangelounge.skie.cx.

30:41.580 --> 30:42.900
It's just that simple.

30:42.900 --> 30:44.700
Anyway, upcoming tournaments.

30:44.700 --> 30:48.500
January 31st is Miggle Extreme at Milpitas Golf Land.

30:48.500 --> 30:52.240
It's going to be a perfect attack and improv freestyle, and I actually am going to have

30:52.240 --> 30:55.000
a half day off work, so I'm going to go. That'll be fun.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.800
Now are you going to enter PA just for the hell of it?

30:58.800 --> 31:03.760
I don't think so, because this is the problem. See, now since I placed fourth at the last

31:03.760 --> 31:07.480
one, and I guess, you know, as they're saying, I upset people and da da da, you know, all

31:07.480 --> 31:12.320
that stuff, there's too much pressure! Like, now I'm expected to enter again, and I don't

31:12.320 --> 31:15.240
want that pressure. I'm going to quit while I'm ahead, I think. I'm going to be a lazy

31:15.240 --> 31:19.640
bum. I'm going to retire. I'm going to do that. I'm going to retire from DDR, and like

31:19.640 --> 31:23.520
in a month i'll come back i'll say all right i fell in love with the game again

31:23.520 --> 31:25.720
because everybody does that

31:25.720 --> 31:26.940
cut the bullshit

31:26.940 --> 31:30.500
just fuck their world up

31:30.500 --> 31:33.220
we'll see we'll see about time somebody else

31:33.220 --> 31:35.620
got in the top category

31:35.620 --> 31:40.500
the first place should not go to an asian

31:40.500 --> 31:42.460
why not are you a racist sir

31:42.460 --> 31:45.540
no yes no i'm just kidding

31:45.540 --> 31:47.100
i want to get really good at perfect attack

31:47.100 --> 31:48.980
so i can win

31:48.980 --> 31:49.980
Do that, girl!

31:49.980 --> 31:55.980
I'm going to memorize all the songs on stealth and make them play them on stealth, and then

31:55.980 --> 31:56.980
I'll wait.

31:56.980 --> 31:57.980
Okay, no, I'm not going to.

31:57.980 --> 31:58.980
Okay, um, shit, what else?

31:58.980 --> 31:59.980
What other tournaments can I...

31:59.980 --> 32:00.980
Oh, Cyber Zone.

32:00.980 --> 32:01.980
Cyber Zone.

32:01.980 --> 32:07.420
And these guys, these guys have some big balls over there because they have this whole commercial

32:07.420 --> 32:08.420
that they're doing now.

32:08.420 --> 32:09.420
They have this whole, like...

32:09.420 --> 32:10.420
Commercial?

32:10.420 --> 32:11.420
Yeah, they put it on the web.

32:11.420 --> 32:12.420
I wish I'd saved it.

32:12.420 --> 32:13.420
I deleted the damn thing after watching it once.

32:13.420 --> 32:16.540
They put a commercial up online that's, like, got all these...

32:16.540 --> 32:17.540
And this is a weird thing.

32:17.540 --> 32:25.640
It's just all these video clips of random DDR freestyles, and it has the AAA dude from

32:25.640 --> 32:30.140
Japan getting the AAA on Max 300 video as a part of it, which has nothing to do with

32:30.140 --> 32:31.300
what they're going to be doing.

32:31.300 --> 32:32.300
But it's cool.

32:32.300 --> 32:38.060
I mean, it's cool that they've got the, I don't know what you'd call it, the ego to

32:38.060 --> 32:40.400
be doing something like that, a commercial.

32:40.400 --> 32:43.780
But that's going to be like a two, three day tournament, and that's in LA in a couple weeks.

32:43.780 --> 32:44.900
And Jamie's mad at them.

32:44.900 --> 32:45.900
Why are you mad at them, Jamie?

32:45.900 --> 32:46.900
part of my fuck you in a week.

32:46.900 --> 32:48.900
Oh, it's going to be part of your fuck you in a week?

32:48.900 --> 32:49.900
Okay.

32:49.900 --> 32:50.900
We'll move back to that later then.

32:50.900 --> 32:55.420
But I'm going to be trying to go to cyber zone, so yeah.

32:55.420 --> 33:01.860
Let's check my private messages because I think we're going to be having some messages

33:01.860 --> 33:02.860
about-

33:02.860 --> 33:03.860
He's already uncoordinated.

33:03.860 --> 33:04.860
This is funny.

33:04.860 --> 33:05.860
Oh my God.

33:05.860 --> 33:06.860
Look, it's sticky.

33:06.860 --> 33:07.860
My desk is sticky.

33:07.860 --> 33:08.860
That's awful.

33:08.860 --> 33:09.860
Okay, that's personal issues, man.

33:09.860 --> 33:10.860
No.

33:10.860 --> 33:11.860
Not that, you perverts.

33:11.860 --> 33:12.860
Gross.

33:12.860 --> 33:13.860
Perverts!

33:13.860 --> 33:14.860
Gross.

33:14.860 --> 33:23.020
I'll tell you what, we'll just get you some wet naps about your monitor.

33:23.020 --> 33:26.660
Muhymer says the East has no tournaments and no machines and they suck.

33:26.660 --> 33:29.160
Just go look on DDR Freeco in the tournament section.

33:29.160 --> 33:31.380
Can we talk about the possibility of Shaft 2?

33:31.380 --> 33:33.420
No, because it's a long ways away.

33:33.420 --> 33:35.340
That's like next November, hello?

33:35.340 --> 33:39.460
Ah, back to basics, February 8th at American Comics.

33:39.460 --> 33:41.980
It's a fourth plus tree, oh, old school.

33:41.980 --> 33:48.980

33:49.720 --> 33:52.520

33:52.520 --> 33:54.760
and greasy

33:54.760 --> 33:56.080
I'm eating my nuts now

33:56.080 --> 33:59.760
I like your nuts

33:59.760 --> 34:02.120
dead air

34:02.120 --> 34:03.800
what do you want me to talk about?

34:03.800 --> 34:04.960
oh

34:04.960 --> 34:06.040
it's in hayward

34:06.040 --> 34:10.160
we need someone new to dedicate our dead air to by the way

34:10.160 --> 34:13.640
you should be dedicated to their faces

34:13.640 --> 34:14.720

We're going to go into a break now, and we're going to start that break with...

35:10.080 --> 35:11.880
What?

35:11.880 --> 35:15.680

35:15.680 --> 35:18.860

I've got CDs. Where's your CD? Is it in here? No, it's right here.

35:23.320 --> 35:24.820
It's right here.

35:24.820 --> 35:26.240
Don't get it.

35:26.240 --> 35:29.320
Don't get it sticky.

35:29.320 --> 35:35.160
I do not want to hear get sticky and rob in the same sentence.

35:35.160 --> 35:38.840
I'm supposed to be talking because god damnit I'm a host.

35:38.840 --> 35:43.120
They're just doing it. You want to?

35:43.120 --> 35:48.000
I'm going to sit back and tell them that my shot went off.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.760
We're going to play something from Xtreme

35:51.760 --> 35:53.640
and something else from Xtreme. This one here?

35:53.640 --> 35:57.000
Okay, we're going to play some stuff from Xtreme.

Okay, first song on the list here is going to be Paranormal Survivor Max and then Dance Dance Revolution.

36:01.840 --> 36:02.680

44:07.300 --> 44:10.820
three hours so she can only have her one shot because it's got to she's got to pee it out

44:10.820 --> 44:15.620
before she can drive home sorry and Loki Loki's the responsible one of the bunch he's not

44:45.620 --> 44:47.620
Oh shit, I almost knocked your shot glass over. My bad.

44:47.620 --> 44:49.620
It's empty. Here, have the rest.

44:55.620 --> 44:57.620
I had a drop.

44:58.620 --> 45:00.620
You dropped the bomb on my tongue.

45:04.620 --> 45:06.620
God dammit, play my song.

45:06.620 --> 45:08.620
I'm sorry, we're not into that.

45:09.620 --> 45:11.620
Ew, you're disgusting.

45:11.620 --> 45:12.620
Where's my propel?

45:42.620 --> 45:43.620
You ready?

45:43.620 --> 45:44.620
Yes!

45:51.620 --> 45:52.620
This is fucked up.

45:53.620 --> 45:54.620
Okay.

45:54.620 --> 45:59.620
Um, first fuck you of the week goes to Rob for having tomorrow off.

45:59.620 --> 46:00.620
Fuck you, bitch!

46:00.620 --> 46:02.620
Bitch, don't make me cut you.

46:02.620 --> 46:05.620
I will. Come over there and beat your ass, woman.

46:05.620 --> 46:07.620
I'd be kicking your ass so hot you'd be tasting rubber in the morning.

46:07.620 --> 46:09.620
I'm gonna kick your ass right back to the kitchen.

46:09.620 --> 46:28.620
Okay. What the fuck ever. Anyway. Yes, my work doesn't believe in racial equality. So, they did not celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. I don't know. I think they just want us all to work a lot.

46:28.620 --> 46:34.620
Also, fuck the faceplate on my CD player.

46:34.620 --> 46:37.620
I thought it was going to be responsible to take my faceplate off.

46:37.620 --> 46:40.620
I put the thing back on and now the buttons aren't lined up.

46:40.620 --> 46:46.620
And whenever I go over a bump or something, the faceplate will get malaligned or something.

46:46.620 --> 46:51.620
And then I have to hit my CD player to get the faceplate back on and then unpause it.

46:51.620 --> 46:54.620
Because it will hit the pause button and then turn down the volume all the way.

46:54.620 --> 46:56.620
Because it's in the faceplate.

46:56.620 --> 46:59.620
Like, fuck that brand. What is it? It's what you have, Rob.

47:00.620 --> 47:01.620
It's just Jensen.

47:02.620 --> 47:04.620
What is it? What? Come on.

47:05.620 --> 47:07.620
I need a toothpick. Fuck your back.

47:09.620 --> 47:12.620
Sorry, everyone. God is shit still in here anyway.

47:13.620 --> 47:14.620
You verped on it.

47:14.620 --> 47:19.620
LOSING MY VOICE

47:44.620 --> 47:50.620
They had a sign on their door that said we're closed due to maintenance and there were fucking people in there.

47:50.620 --> 47:52.620
The fucks.

47:52.620 --> 47:56.620
So we go to teach our Fridays because they have that late night weekend feel.

47:56.620 --> 47:58.620
They were closed.

47:58.620 --> 48:00.620
Ditches.

48:00.620 --> 48:02.620
Rock's about to bring more candy.

48:02.620 --> 48:04.620
Um.

48:04.620 --> 48:08.620
Fucks not having my animal crossing town for two weeks.

48:08.620 --> 48:10.620
But Dan's going to go retrieve it for me.

48:10.620 --> 48:14.620
For me to think very nice. Thank you to Pini for keeping our village happy.

48:14.620 --> 48:17.620
Although I probably have cockroaches living under my bonfire.

48:17.620 --> 48:20.620
Yes, because my house is a shrine to fire.

48:24.620 --> 48:25.620
Fuck.

48:25.620 --> 48:30.620
I'm not wanting to go to the convention today and miss me since he's my man.

48:30.620 --> 48:32.620
But hey, I got plenty of bucks back, so it's cool.

48:35.620 --> 48:39.620
Waffle Square was really nice, but fuck them putting butter on my English muffins.

48:39.620 --> 48:46.620
to take it back. And, um, buck my shoes. Again. My new Vans are really awesome and comfy,

48:49.420 --> 48:53.140
but they like slip loose on my heel and then the tongue is one of those super thick cushy

48:53.140 --> 49:00.140
ones. And now, um, um, I think. This is fucked up. Yes, I needed that. Okay. Um, so I had

49:03.380 --> 49:06.860
to go get cross trainer shoes or I had to get some of his kickboxing shoes to work at

49:06.860 --> 49:11.860
Yeah, I was on the exercise bike, and my feet went numb. Here's my shoes.

49:11.860 --> 49:24.860
Um, let's see. Another fuck you goes to, um, me, for only being able to last 12 minutes on the elliptical trainer, but I'm building up to it.

49:24.860 --> 49:33.860
It also, uh, another fuck you goes to me for stepping from the hot seating gym to go into the freezing cold outside, get the microphone out of the crotch, okay?

49:33.860 --> 49:34.860
Sorry.

49:34.860 --> 49:54.140
I'm talking to you and I've got the microphone right now, we're live.

49:54.140 --> 49:56.140
You're heading over right now?

49:56.140 --> 50:02.140
Okay, I've been holding the speaker up to say something to the listeners.

50:05.140 --> 50:07.140
They can't hear that.

50:07.140 --> 50:14.140
They can't hear you. Unfortunately, because I don't have the phone that has like 20 million decibels or something.

50:14.140 --> 50:21.140
So, head on over. We're doing fuck yous right now. We're doing the fuck yous of the week right now.

50:21.140 --> 50:22.140
Great radio right here.

50:22.140 --> 50:24.140
Alright, we'll save one for you, okay?

50:24.140 --> 50:28.140
Alright, come on over, we're all getting drunk, or we'll rob this.

50:28.140 --> 50:30.140
Alright, see you in a few.

50:30.140 --> 50:31.140
No, no.

50:31.140 --> 50:32.140
Bye.

50:32.140 --> 50:35.140
Jonas went for like 45 minutes last week with his fuck you.

50:35.140 --> 50:36.140
He's, he's, he's-

50:36.140 --> 50:37.140
He gets two.

50:37.140 --> 50:40.140
He's quoted, he's get two, he get two's fuck you's, that's it.

50:40.140 --> 50:41.140
Yeah.

50:41.140 --> 50:42.140
Um, I was still doing-

50:42.140 --> 50:44.140
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I paused that for your phone call, go ahead.

50:44.140 --> 50:49.140
Okay, well, I, I would have to say fuck you to my boys, except I think that right now

50:49.140 --> 50:56.140
my voice is really fucking cool except I can't like sing in the car with my new CD player

50:57.580 --> 51:03.580
and it sucks because I like holding I hate people being off the beat and I try my hardest

51:03.580 --> 51:10.580
to stay on the beat and it hurts my musicians pride it makes me have a sniff and it's like

51:11.580 --> 51:18.580
that person who I got a picture of the car like mine from for not allowing remote leaving

51:18.580 --> 51:20.580
Fuck you. Yeah.

51:20.580 --> 51:24.580
Um, yeah.

51:24.580 --> 51:25.580
Sorry.

51:25.580 --> 51:27.580
I think I'm gonna pass away.

51:27.580 --> 51:29.580
Okay, Logie's turn.

51:30.580 --> 51:33.580
No one thinks I always have, like, a lot of things to talk to me about.

51:33.580 --> 51:38.580
Actually, I'm kinda tired right now and not very angsty, but I have a couple things to do.

51:38.580 --> 51:41.580
Um, first one goes to Lustketchup.

51:41.580 --> 51:46.580
You unoriginal bitches need to get your own song and own dance steps. Stop ripping off of other people.

51:46.580 --> 51:51.580
I know that dance. It's the hand jive. It was back in the 60s or 50s, whenever the fuck it was.

51:51.580 --> 51:55.580
It was in the... whatever! It was in the fucking...

51:55.580 --> 51:59.580
Yeah, but the dance... the whole movie took place back in the 50s or 60s, so there.

51:59.580 --> 52:02.580
Anyways, so, the whole dance is the stupid hand jive.

52:02.580 --> 52:05.580
And your stupid song, you know, Rapper's Delight, yeah, we know it.

52:05.580 --> 52:07.580
So you butchered it with stupid, you know, Spanish lyrics.

52:07.580 --> 52:12.580
You know, you can go fuck yourselves, and go process yourselves like every other failing artist out there.

52:12.580 --> 52:14.580
So, uh, bye.

52:14.580 --> 52:18.140
The second nephew goes to the freakin DDR3 machine for freezing up

52:18.780 --> 52:24.660
Konami seriously, you need to make something that works right the first time something that's not messed up any sort of way

52:25.340 --> 52:31.520
I don't know. Have you ever heard of now the testing your fucking shit you tested it for like couple weeks now

52:31.520 --> 52:33.620
Why didn't you catch this shit when it you know?

52:34.300 --> 52:36.300
originally had

52:36.300 --> 52:43.300
and

52:46.480 --> 52:49.820
anyway

52:49.820 --> 52:51.540
we didn't get back here

52:51.540 --> 52:53.820
has to be the time it doesn't mean that

52:53.820 --> 52:57.980
low-key doesn't want to fuck me doesn't swing that way

52:57.980 --> 52:58.940

53:04.980 --> 53:08.320
we got more people to do it if you don't have a finish-up looking at any of the

53:08.320 --> 53:10.280
guests and uh...

53:10.280 --> 53:14.000
happy to see the drivers because you know i hate you and you just won't die

53:14.000 --> 53:15.680
like i want to do

53:15.680 --> 53:18.020
i mean if you give you don't have to bring in

53:18.020 --> 53:20.660

53:20.660 --> 53:24.460
uh... it is difficult on my website for now working all week

53:24.460 --> 53:26.500
and uh... but we think that that might work

53:26.500 --> 53:28.600
that's not a feeling more

53:28.600 --> 53:30.580
uh... what's here

53:33.340 --> 53:37.940
look at me trying to figure out what I'm doing on the DDR pad. If you're too dumb to realize

53:37.940 --> 53:42.540
what the hell a game is, then you shouldn't be in an arcade. Go away. I'm just really

53:42.540 --> 53:48.780
nice. There's lots of alcohol there. Okay, keep going, keep going. I can't, there's too

53:48.780 --> 53:58.780
many distractions. Oh, there's peer pressure. No freaking, um, I don't know. I don't really

53:58.780 --> 54:02.700
have much. That, I think I'm done for now. I'm sure I'll think of more later to complain

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:31.200
Fuck all men in general.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.920
Rob is falling over.

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:38.680

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:47.160

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.960
i can taste the music he got giddy with an alibu

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.960
No, he likes the mouth.

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.960
He loves the cock.

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.960
It's pink, Rob, drink it.

01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.960
Yes, I have spike hair.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.960
Rob, Rob, is this drink?

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.960
I have names of pussies.

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.960
Weird.

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.960
Turn off the background music on the, uh, thing.

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.960
Okay, I...

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:15.960
My idea goes to hangovers, because last night...

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:17.960
Damn.

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:21.960
Rob, you spilled it on you. That's alcohol abuse.

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:24.960
Wipe it up with something. Don't lick it.

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.960
I was never sitting in that chair.

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.960
Ew, he licked it and now he's pumping it.

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:31.960
He just wiped up alcohol with his ass.

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:33.960
My F.U. goes to hangovers.

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:40.960
I had a lot of Long Island iced tea and three other drinks yesterday.

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.960
The Will Special at Polyester's.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:47.960
I was sleeping in until two today, so there you go.

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:50.960
Rob, are you coherent?

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:52.960
Are you going to drink, Brad?

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:53.960
I'll have a shot or two.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.960
I'll make you a shot.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:56.960
No, I just want some Goldschlager.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.960
I'll make you a normal one, I promise.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:09:59.960
I'll make you a normal one.

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.960
Oh, I just want some Goldschlager.

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:03.960
If I run to the bathroom, do you guys want to take the show over?

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:04.960
Chat room!

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:05.960
Okay.

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:06.960
Wait, you guys want to take the show over?

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.960
Come back with a wet paper towel.

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.960
Yeah, get a wet paper towel so we can clean that shit up.

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:11.960

It's gonna take a moment.

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:50.060
I can hear Rob screaming out there.

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:53.060
Rob just said shit really loud, by the way.

01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:56.060
Rob, don't run. Rob, don't run.

01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:58.060
I'm gonna pee and somebody's in the bathroom.

01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:00.060
You're just burning in his bathroom.

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:06.060
We're gonna play some songs, yeah. I'm just gonna pick some random stuff.

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:09.060
Okay, Matt, do your job.

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:13.060
I'm just picking stuff out of this random directory.

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:15.060
I want to pick really bad music.

01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:18.060
Okay, we'll put in some bad music in a minute.

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:21.060
But in the meantime, here's everyone's favorite vocalist.

01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:23.060
Woohoo!

01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:25.060

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:40.360
Hi, this is Melby of RTF.

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:45.360
For an extra dollar ninety-nine a minute, my girlfriend, Melody, can join us on all the fun together.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:52.360
Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great?

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:59.360
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.360
Um, Rob's fucked up.

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:09.360
Dark Sakura has taken over the command center because I don't want to drive drunk, ladies and gentlemen.

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:13.360
We need a designated radio personality.

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:16.360
I'm designated!

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:20.360
What are we going to talk about, you designated diva?

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:25.360
We need to do the list list, so I'll give you the chair back if you promise to type responsibly.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.360
Okay, wait, let's talk about something else.

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.360
Jonas is in the house!

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:31.360
Hi!

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:34.360
Hey, explicit's in the house!

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:38.360
You're not allowed to do FUs this week though, you did like three weeks worth last week.

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:42.360
I know. Okay, you can do one FU. You can do one.

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:46.360
Okay. This is the one big FU right here. Only one.

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:52.360
To the asshole, you erased my damn GameCube, PS2, and Xbox memory cards.

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:57.360
I don't know, but some asshole erased my files in there.

01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:01.360
Sixty games saved. You fuck.

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:05.360
It's not you. It's a guy. I like you. You're cool.

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:11.360
to where it did this, fuck you! Nothing says fuck you more than me giving you an ass-kicking

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:12.360
before I found out who the hell you are.

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:27.360
Hi. Okay Jonas, what's up? That's your F.U.? That's my only F.U. right now.

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:31.920
So how you doing, brother? How you doing? Alright. You're not going to be able to drink

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:37.080
with us tonight. That's a shame. Oh well. It's not my drove anyway. What do you think

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:44.080
of Extreme? Kix's ass. The hella Kix's ass. Wait, I got a question for future tournaments.

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:52.680
Would there be beginner mode allowed? For freestyle. I think there should be a tournament

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:59.560
or a beginner mode. Beginner shuffle for improv. Like a weak improv tourney for white boys

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:02.840
like myself

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:05.240
why can't like rate the bar

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:11.600
and you like the no lies dancing

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:15.320
and we're going to have to use until the music at school

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.000
uh... i think that he

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.720
uh... careful

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:23.200
the way to get to the

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:26.200
well as you read your book about what they're going to die here

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:28.160
not better people really

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:31.600
drinking eight shots of glass, and so forth.

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:32.720
I drank pussy.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:35.120
Oh my god, I drank a pussy.

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:36.640
Dear lord.

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.840
I made the new nastiest shot ever,

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:42.360
a combination of hot damn Goldschlager and Malibu,

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:46.440
and I call it pussy, because it's pink like pussy. We should warn any new listeners

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:49.340
listening tonight that this is not the normal

01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:50.880
orange lounge, because

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.080
I'm drunk as shit.

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:56.840
Yeah, Guacamole del Tango. That's not what we usually do on this show, although we

01:21:56.840 --> 01:22:01.200
We could, except I usually work Mondays, but not this Monday, because Martin Luther King

01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:08.080
Jr. is having a birthday tomorrow, even though he's dead.

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:09.080
He's still having a birthday.

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.080
I'm repeating my fuck you, Rob.

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:12.080
What?

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:13.080
Bitch.

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:14.080

01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:15.080
Bitch.

01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:16.080
Wait, what?

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.080
Fuck you.

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.080
Bitch.

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:19.080
What did I do to you?

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:20.080
What did I do to you?

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:21.080
You have to borrow off.

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:22.080
Bitch.

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.080
So I still gotta go to my, actually, no, you know what, that's not entirely true, because

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:24.080
I'm going to my second job tomorrow.

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:25.080
Oh.

the forget that

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:55.160

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:22.960
care about. But EX2, it's kind of weird as they've got a bunch of new covers on there.

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:26.560
They have Extreme doing a cover of Long Train Runnin' this time around.

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:31.060
They have I Like to Move It being done by DJ Alligator Project.

01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:35.860
So that's going to be pretty interesting.

01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:38.720
So they have that happening.

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:44.040
They've got Sex on the Beach 2003 by Erotic.

01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:46.300
It's going to be on there.

01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:49.600
So it's the same song with just some trancey shit in the background.

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:52.600
I don't know, let's pull up the full list here.

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:54.600
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:57.600

01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:58.600
You're on.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.600
And, let's see here.

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.600
I can't get drunk tonight, and that sucks.

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:04.600
I can take it if I want to.

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:06.600
You can take the cock?

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:08.600
Not like that.

01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:10.600
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:13.600
Okay, here's a quick recap.

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.600
Rob thinks he's not drunk enough.

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:20.600
What do you think about Brad's gay sex fantasy with me?

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:24.600
This is like a soap opera.

01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:26.600
Why do I even try?

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:27.600
Read, please.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:31.600
Alright, we've got, um, we've got, uh, starting off, we couldn't handle this big black cock.

Captain Jack Centerfold, the 130 BPM Move It remix.

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:36.600

Happy for them.

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:12.240
us more stuff. I want the disco one. I want the disco CD. Somebody get that for me, okay?

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:14.340
Because that's like right before my birthday.

01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:17.160
Jamie, tell us about that disco special that was on ABC.

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:22.560
Okay, I was at the gym and I was bored so I got on the net bike. And, by the way, I

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:29.720
didn't crash it this time. I was on the net pulse bike and there was this disco special

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:34.600
on ABC. It was like disco house party or something, but it was hosted by Whoopi Goldberg. And

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:39.200
And Paula Abdul was on it.

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:43.520
But it was like, yeah Paula Abdul was on that.

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:44.520
Oh, it's Brad.

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:45.520
Never mind.

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:46.520
No, Paula Abdul.

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:47.520
Oh, it's Brad.

01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:48.520
Oh, it's Brad.

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:52.520
But no, it was a pretty neat special, but I was only on the bike for 30 minutes.

01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:53.520
Stop it.

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:56.520
I was on the thing for 30 minutes because I was doing my warm up.

01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:59.280
Yeah, because I go to the gym now.

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.280
Chili's.

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.280
Yeah, anyway.

01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:03.240
yet anyway uh...

01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:07.840
it was pretty cool because they played It's Raining Men

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:12.080
and like it was Whoopi Goldberg singing with this other, I think the lady who originally did it

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:13.240
I don't remember who it was

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:16.760
and then all these guys came down, it was Gloria Gaynor

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:18.880
Gloria Gaynor did I Will Strive

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:20.280
yeah I know

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:21.400
but um

01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:23.280
dude they had um

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:25.320
what was her name, Nicki French

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:26.140
was that her name?

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:30.240
you can tell her low eclipse of the heart

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:35.640
Yeah, they had her come and sing Total Clips of the Heart, but it was all sped up and disco-y.

01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:41.440
And then, they had Usher doing, oh God, what's that song, but it was really cool, because

01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:46.420
when he was out there singing it, he was wearing the little cap, and he was wearing Heelys

01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:49.280
and spinning around in it, and then they had all these people dancing on roller skates.

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:51.120
Please tell me Usher did Dancing Queen.

01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:52.120
That would be hilarious.

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:55.920
No, but they did, but a bunch of drag queens did Dancing Queen.

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.920
That was fabulous.

01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:01.100
No, uh, but, um, what was the song that Usher did?

01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:03.440
It was, um, Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now.

01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:06.520
I think that was it, but it was really cool.

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:09.880
And I normally, I don't like hearing him sing, but he did that song justice.

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:10.460
So it was cool.

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.380
And it was just kind of neat watching everybody dance in roller

01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:14.720
skates cause I had his Xanadu moment.

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:16.800
Wow.

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.040
Everyone's cleared out of the studio.

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:21.400
Hey, there's a really weird stench in this area here.

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:23.880
I mean, it's the stench of Drunk Rob.

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:26.320
Yeah, that is my shoes.

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:26.640
Sorry.

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:29.640
I gotta get used to that man, I'm forgetting the part of it.

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:34.640
Well next week is not a drunk week, I'm sorry.

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:36.640
I don't think I can make it though, tomorrow.

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:37.640
Tomorrow?

01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:39.640
Oh man, I don't want to go to work tomorrow.

01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:45.640
Freaking A, they suck. They don't give me anything to do at work, and I get all my work done, including all the busy work that I make for myself.

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:48.640
And then they're like, oh sorry, you can't go and play on the internet.

01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:50.640
Okay, well what the hell am I supposed to do, stare at the wall?

01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:53.640
So that's what I've been doing for the last three days, is staring at the fucking wall.

01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:55.640
So, yeah.

01:28:55.640 --> 01:29:05.880
I have the best thing ever we have I can't say who it is but are one of our

You're fired.

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:29.440
I have the chair.

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:31.440
I have some information about Jahi.

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:33.440
Yesterday...

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:35.440
Uh, yeah.

01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:37.440
Rob remembers this.

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:41.440
I saw Jahi in his skivvies, but we're not supposed to talk about that.

01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:43.440
Uh...

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:45.440
We don't want to spread too many rumors here.

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:47.440
What's it say?

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:49.440
Don't say who, don't say who.

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:51.440
Somebody wants to take the cock.

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:53.440
They will remain nameless.

01:29:53.440 --> 01:30:05.440
Rob, you should go find some boobs.

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:07.440
Hey, Rob needs some boobs.

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:08.440
Rob's got boobs.

01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:10.440
Dude, Brad, your shadow is fucking awesome.

01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.440

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.440

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:16.440
Touch your boobs.

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:18.440
I can't touch them.

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:20.440
I'm trying to quit.

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:22.440
Hey

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:26.260
Away from him. He's over here molesting girls

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:34.440
Rob likes boobs. Yo, you're listening to Orange Lounge radio. This is the show of all shows

Okay, you know what? I think I want to talk about extreme. Yes, you are extreme

01:30:56.280 --> 01:31:00.000
Fucking fuck okay. I thought I was old and

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:07.100
Broken down and smelly and I wasn't ever gonna rank on it on a non-stop ever again, but I ranked. What's up?

01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:32.100
Rob is an angry drunk.

01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:34.100
Rob, where's the song?

01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:36.100
Where's the song?

01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:38.100
Someone's...

01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:41.100
Oh yeah, by the way, our word of the night...

01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:43.100
Everyone...

01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:45.100
Our word of the night is porn.

01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:47.100
Porn!

01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:49.100
You don't have it?

01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:51.100
You get porn!

01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:53.100
When you say the word.

01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:56.100
Do I get a shot of something if I say the word?

01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:57.100
No!

01:31:57.100 --> 01:32:00.100
We're trying to get to our porny music.

01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:35.100
He does it to me because I've known him for what, almost 4 years now? 3 years?

01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:39.100
I know Tina a long time and she'll let me touch her boobs whenever I want.

01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:42.100
Because I know he doesn't get off and so it's all fine.

01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:43.100
Rata's the best.

01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:46.100
I know. It's all for Brockie.

01:32:47.100 --> 01:32:49.100
Oh my god, he's just trying to punch my leg.

01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:51.100
Like his honey?

01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:53.100
Yeah, exactly.

01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:54.100
What, pet him and he'll growl?

01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:55.100
I don't know.

01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:58.100
Does anybody remember the master being Bear from Conan O'Brien?

01:32:58.100 --> 01:33:00.100
I love that thing

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:08.180

Fish heads eat them up young.

In the morning, laughing happy fish heads.

01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:15.740
In the evening, floating in the soup.

01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:20.740
Fish heads, fish heads, roly-poly fish heads.

01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:25.740
Fish heads, fish heads, eat them up young.

01:36:25.740 --> 01:36:29.740
Ask a fish head anything you want to.

01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:34.740
They won't answer, they can't talk

01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:38.740
Fish heads, fish heads, roly-poly fish heads

01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:43.740
Fish heads, fish heads, eat them up young

That's enough for the fish heads, I'm sorry

01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:51.740

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.800
The show went to fucking hell.

01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:02.800
Don't ruin the moment.

01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:04.800
I'll do it. Come on.

01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:08.800
Ugh!

01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:10.800
Yeah, I got off.

01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:14.800
Rob just tried to grab, um...

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:15.800
Hey!

01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:16.800
Sorry everybody.

01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:18.800
Don't touch the Jamie.

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:19.800
No.

01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:22.800
Because there's somebody who's going to kick your ass if you do, and you know who that is.

01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:24.800
Yeah, Dan.

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:26.800
Dan would so, like, kick your ass.

01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:28.800
your ass. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to kill you.

01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:30.800
Dan Dario likes me.

01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:32.800
No, no one does, Ron.

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.800
Dan Dario?

01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:38.800
I know that there are certain people in town that don't like me, but Dan's not one of them.

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:40.800
Dan likes you.

01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:42.800
Yeah, Dan Dario's my bro. He's cool.

01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:46.800
Dan likes you, with a nice Chianti and some fava beans.

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:48.800
And some gum.

01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:50.800
Gum!

01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:52.800
Sorry, that was a Zorak.

01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:57.040
Even the people in town that don't like me I think are starting to be okay with me, so that's cool

01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:00.820
Everybody just wants your ass eventually they realize they can't beat you

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:06.440
Everybody loves me you love me they come around

01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:09.640
You know what I had to

01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:11.480
Wait

01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:14.200
Dude, they just shooting star. I'll give you a cage match

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:17.560
Here's your cage match. Okay cage match time

01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:27.560
Rob seems to be somewhat sober enough that he can take the chair again. So Rob, I give you back your chair.

01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:53.000
Kage match it's the drunken cage matches but I still haven't even picked my song

01:40:53.000 --> 01:41:02.080
for this week however last week in the big fat bloated cage match we had the

01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:06.800
winner was Aphex Twin doing a song called eat him up no it's not called eat

01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:11.720

01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:15.520

01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:16.020
Yum?

01:41:45.520 --> 01:42:13.520
I'm going to go ahead and do a handstand, handstand, handstand, handstand, handstand.

01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:30.620
Alright, that was last week's winner, AFX Twin, with a song called Power Pill.

01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:35.140
And you can vote for that, or you can vote for one of the new entries into the cage match

01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:36.140
this week.

01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:37.140
This is the first one.

01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:38.140
Loki, tell us about it.

01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:41.980
This is a Yumi Hamasaki with my favorite.

01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:43.980
This song right here got me into Yumi again.

01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:44.980
A Yumi AGAIN?

01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:46.980
Yes, a Yumi AGAIN!

01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:48.980
This is my favorite track and verse.

01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:50.980
It's M, Above and Beyond.

01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:52.980
Alright, you can vote for this.

01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:54.980
This is Yumi Osaki with M, Above and Beyond.

01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:56.180
ORANGELOGIC AGMATCH!

01:46:54.980 --> 01:47:14.620
Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:18.340
I'm starting to get a little bit of my coherency back after drinking so much this show.

01:47:18.340 --> 01:47:19.340
Should I have a new shot?

01:47:19.340 --> 01:47:20.340
Yeah, I think I need another new shot.

01:47:20.340 --> 01:47:21.340
No.

01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:22.340
Okay, that was-

01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:27.340
Yumi Hamasaki with M, the above and beyond mix. What did you think of that, Jamie?

01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:29.340
That was pretty cool. I give it an 8.

01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:32.340
8. Brad, what did you think of Yumi Hamasaki with M?

01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:33.340
Out of a scale of 10?

01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:34.340
Yes.

01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:37.340
I give it an 8. I think Connect is better.

01:47:37.340 --> 01:47:39.340
Alright. Loki?

01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:44.340
I give it a 9 because I like all of her stuff and I can't judge you on which is the best.

01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:46.340
Alright, Explicit.

01:47:46.340 --> 01:47:49.340
Haha! 8.5.

01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:51.340
Any reason?

01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:55.340
I don't know, I like Connected better, but this one's pretty good. I like it very well.

01:48:21.340 --> 01:48:23.340
Orange Blonde Radio's cage match.

01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:58.340
Take my thoughts with you and when you look behind

01:48:58.340 --> 01:49:05.340
You will surely see a face that you recognise

01:49:05.340 --> 01:49:13.340
You're not alone, I'll wait till the end of time

01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:20.340
Open your mind, surely it's plain to see

01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:23.340
You're not alone

01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:27.340
I wait till the end of time for you

01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:30.340
Open your mind

01:49:31.340 --> 01:49:36.340
Surely it's time to be with me

01:49:45.340 --> 01:49:47.340
It is the distance

01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:51.340
That makes life a little hard

01:49:51.340 --> 01:49:55.340
Two minds that once were close

01:49:55.340 --> 01:49:59.340
Not so many miles apart

01:49:59.340 --> 01:50:02.340
I will not falter though

01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:06.340
I'll hold on till you're home

01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:09.340
Take it back where you belong

01:50:09.340 --> 01:50:13.340
And see how our lovers grow

01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:20.340
You're not alone I'll wait till the end of time

01:50:20.340 --> 01:50:27.340
Open your mind Surely it's plain to see

01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:35.340
You're not alone I'll wait till the end of time for you

01:50:35.340 --> 01:50:37.340
Open your mind

01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:43.340
Surely there's time to be with me

01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:18.340
You're not alone, I'll wait till the end of time

01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:25.340
Open your mind, surely it's plain to see

01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:32.340
You're not alone, I'll wait till the end of time for you

01:51:32.340 --> 01:51:34.340
Open your mind

01:51:36.340 --> 01:51:39.340
Surely there's time to be with me

01:51:39.340 --> 01:51:41.340
You're not alone

01:51:43.340 --> 01:51:45.340
I'll wait till the end of time

01:51:46.340 --> 01:51:48.340
Open your mind

01:51:50.340 --> 01:51:53.340
Baby there's time to be with me

01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:55.340
You're not alone

01:51:57.340 --> 01:52:00.340
I'll wait till the end of time

01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:02.340
Open your mind

01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:04.340
Open your mind

01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:07.340
Sure it is time to be real

01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:09.340
You're not alone

01:52:09.340 --> 01:52:11.340
You're not alone

01:52:11.340 --> 01:52:14.340
Wait till the end of time with you

01:52:14.340 --> 01:52:16.340
Open your mind

01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:18.340
Open your mind

01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:23.340
It ain't the time for me and you

01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:55.300
I think I don't know. Anyway, what'd you guys think about you give that a nine? All right, Jamie

01:52:59.820 --> 01:53:04.740
All right, cool what you who else is back there I can't see Jonas what you think of that

01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:07.300
I give it a nine. I like it. I like it very much

01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:11.820
Our chat room doesn't seem to like it. It's weird. We all seem to like it if the chat room doesn't

01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:15.820
I like it. I don't really like things like that.

01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:19.820
I liked it too.

01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:23.820
I give it a 10. It ruled. And if you don't like it, you can kiss my fat ass.

01:53:23.820 --> 01:53:27.820
Okay, send your votes over a private message

01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:31.820
in the chat room. And you can

01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:35.820
vote for either the power pill song

01:53:35.820 --> 01:53:56.700
the above and beyond mix, or you can vote for Olive with You Are Not Alone. Send those

01:53:56.700 --> 01:54:01.660
votes over a private message to me, Sky, in the chat room right now and we'll tally those

01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:06.300
up and read them for you towards the end of the show. In the meantime, we're preparing

01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:11.180
for a listless really fast. The topic tonight, Jamie, tell us about tonight's topic for listless.

01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:16.540
I need to name my car, and I don't know what to name it. The only thing I'm really going

01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:20.880
to do to the outside of it is put the little i right next to the dx on the back of my car

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:27.920
so I can be 2dx. So basically the way that you play listless is each of us lists our

01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:34.920
our top three picks, then everybody votes one off the island.

01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:09.000
I've been drinking a little bit, shut up, more like a lot, don't touch me, you're violating

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:14.400
me, oh my God, my titty, okay, alright, we're going to take a really quick break, we're

01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:19.020
going to take a two minute break with a song from 2DX8 style and we'll be right back with

01:55:19.020 --> 01:55:26.020
tonight's list list things we're gonna name jamie's car

01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:47.940
Let's reveal tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge

01:57:47.940 --> 01:57:54.240
cage match, shall we? It was very, very close tonight. It was one vote separated, the winner

01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:59.260
in the second place. But tonight's winner, ladies and gentlemen, you are all such whores

01:57:59.260 --> 01:58:07.260
for a Yumi Hamasaki, ladies and gentlemen. M wins by one vote. Pac-Man was in second

01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:12.660
place, one vote behind, and Olive was two votes behind. Very close, very close. You

01:58:12.660 --> 01:58:16.380
guys were very close match tonight. But that means you get to put in a new song next week,

01:58:16.380 --> 01:58:17.380
Oh, yay.

01:58:17.380 --> 01:58:18.380
Make me think.

01:58:18.380 --> 01:58:19.380
Alright.

01:58:19.380 --> 01:58:20.380
So, I am.

01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:24.860
We'll be going into rotation on the Orange Lounge normal show.

01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:25.860
The thingy.

01:58:25.860 --> 01:58:27.740
Anyway, let's do tonight's list list!

01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:28.740
Yay!

01:58:28.740 --> 01:58:29.980
Although I'm not even done with my list yet.

01:58:29.980 --> 01:58:32.700
I was still trying to look up some names here.

01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:33.700
Um...

01:58:33.700 --> 01:58:36.700
Yeah, okay.

01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:37.700
Rob's thinking.

01:58:37.700 --> 01:58:38.700
I got it.

01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:39.700
It's been a while.

01:58:39.700 --> 01:58:40.700
You know.

01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:41.700
You're supposed to pick three.

01:58:41.700 --> 01:58:42.700
Do you have three?

01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:43.700
Does everybody have three?

01:58:43.700 --> 01:58:44.700
I think the little gears in his brain...

01:58:44.700 --> 01:58:45.700
Jonas is still working, then.

01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:49.700
The gears in his brain are well greased, but there's no electricity going to them.

01:58:49.700 --> 01:58:52.700
That's right. Keep talking, I gotta close some of these windows.

01:58:52.700 --> 01:58:57.700
Words! Talking! I like to talk. Um, what?

01:58:57.700 --> 01:59:06.700
Is that why I'm smelling steam in the front room? Is that why I'm smelling steam in the front room, because Rob is stinking?

01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:10.700
That's exactly it, but I thought it said he sounded like he's stinking.

01:59:10.700 --> 01:59:13.700
Kiss my black ass, you guys.

01:59:13.700 --> 01:59:18.280
Robbie stink. I don't stink. You'll have a black ass when I'm done.

01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:21.720
Rob, you don't have a black ass. I'm sorry to inform you of this.

01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:26.200
Rob. You smell like roses. No, no, no, no. Rob will have a black ass

01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:30.840
after I'm done kicking it. Can I help? Yeah. Woo hoo! Let's do that right now on the air.

01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:34.360
Rob, bend over. Bend over, bitch.

01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:37.560
Oh yeah. I can't feel shit.

01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:40.960
Aw, baby. Come on, bitch. Bring it on.

01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:41.960
Hold on.

01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:42.960
Back off.

01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:43.960
I've got to fart.

01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:44.960
Ew!

01:59:44.960 --> 01:59:49.960
That sound was my hand hitting his ass.

01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:50.960
Okay.

01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:51.960
Does everybody have...

01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:53.960
Jonas, you still working over there, buddy?

01:59:53.960 --> 01:59:54.960
Are you done?

01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:55.960
You're all done?

01:59:55.960 --> 01:59:56.960
All right.

01:59:56.960 --> 01:59:57.960
Here we go.

01:59:57.960 --> 01:59:58.960
Tonight's list list.

Oh no, you didn't, bitch.

02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:39.900
Alright, Jonas, you gotta take one of these names off the list.

02:04:39.900 --> 02:04:44.900
This is from a nice man, let me see, I don't even know what to take out, but...

02:04:44.900 --> 02:04:54.420
Oh no, oh Jamie vetoed it, Jamie vetoed it. You gotta take something else off instead.

02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:12.900
my move out of my way bitch, I gotta run myself. Yeah, that's more of what Jamie's gonna say

02:05:12.900 --> 02:05:14.900
when she's driving the car, not the name of the car.

02:05:14.900 --> 02:05:16.900
Precious, move out of my way bitch or I'll run your ass over.

02:05:16.900 --> 02:05:19.900
Alright, so move out of my way bitch or I'll run your ass over.

Max cubed is coming off the list, I'm sorry to hear it.

02:05:34.900 --> 02:05:40.900
Alright, my pick for coming off the list, I'm sorry to whack Jonas twice in a row,

02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:44.220
but buzz isn't really something that I don't think Jamie would want to name her car, so

02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:48.420
I have to take buzz off the list. So, we're left with a tiny little list here.

02:05:48.420 --> 02:05:54.020
I know what my pick is. And these are your choices, ladies and gentlemen.

02:05:54.020 --> 02:05:58.500
Just because Jamie doesn't have to go with what you guys say, but you can send me your

02:05:58.500 --> 02:05:59.900
votes. This is the unofficial secondary nickname.

02:05:59.900 --> 02:06:05.420

Just so the Asian Harry Potter knows, Buzz was taken off the list by me.

02:06:28.380 --> 02:06:29.380
Sorry.

02:06:29.380 --> 02:06:30.860
What did he say?

02:06:30.860 --> 02:06:34.220
He voted for Buzz, but he can't vote for Buzz because I took Buzz off the list.

02:06:34.220 --> 02:06:44.540
Ha. Suck me. Alright. I'm not naming my car suck me. No, you can't stress it, you can

something in here that's bad

02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:14.460
it's like mold

02:11:14.460 --> 02:11:17.320
there's a mold on the inside of the coke and that's it

02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:18.960

Oh no, yeah, you can.

02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:41.760
It's gonna take a while though.

02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:43.840
It's gonna take like an hour to wash, an hour to dry.

02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:45.840
What do you wanna do?

02:12:26.660 --> 02:12:31.800
Jamie, are you going to name the car Vic Viper?

02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:33.720
I will name it something based off of Vic Viper.

02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:36.720
I will name it Pentaro.

02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:37.720
What exactly is Pentaro?

02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:39.720
Is that the Parodius version?

02:12:39.720 --> 02:12:41.760
Yes, from Parodius.

02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:45.720
I mean, because the only other one would be, the only other character that I use in Parodius

02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:51.240
This is Tadosuke, so I'll use Pintado.

02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:53.340
We have some good last minute suggestions come in.

02:12:53.340 --> 02:13:14.000
The Nocturnal Penile Tercessants Max, the Azian Blazer, the Vic Vipers Nocturnal Penile

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Tercessants.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000

to look at the top of the talk about

02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:22.120
drunk drunk revolution

02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:24.860
this man is an expert in front of religion

02:14:24.860 --> 02:14:26.520
when they went to vegas

02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:31.840

uh...

02:14:54.500 --> 02:14:56.060
it's

02:14:56.060 --> 02:14:59.700
to get it

02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:01.020
oh my god

02:15:01.020 --> 02:15:05.020
That last shot that I made for Rob was Malibu and Midori.

02:15:05.020 --> 02:15:06.020
And Midori.

02:15:06.020 --> 02:15:09.020
You are going to have a serious hangover, my friend.

02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:11.020
Too much liquor.

02:15:11.020 --> 02:15:13.020
What do you think about that?

02:15:13.020 --> 02:15:14.020
Be money-related.

02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:16.020
Ah, hold on, I'm queuing something up here.

02:15:16.020 --> 02:15:18.020
That wasn't what I asked you.

02:15:18.020 --> 02:15:20.020
Shut the fuck up, bitch.

02:15:20.020 --> 02:15:22.020
Aw, you didn't.

02:15:22.020 --> 02:15:23.020
Aw, no.

02:15:23.020 --> 02:15:25.020
Oh, no.

02:15:25.020 --> 02:15:31.020
Think about Drunk Drunk Revolution, Drunk Mania, Drunk Drunk Paradise, Drunk Drunk Pre-

02:15:31.020 --> 02:15:33.020
Oh my god.

02:15:34.020 --> 02:15:36.020
Key Drunk Mania or whatever.

02:15:36.020 --> 02:15:38.020
Key Drunk Mania.

02:15:38.020 --> 02:15:40.020
Think of the possibility that Trump would do-

02:15:40.020 --> 02:15:43.020
Drunk Drunk Reggae? Is that what he said, Matt?

02:15:44.020 --> 02:15:46.020
Drunk Drunk Reggae from Jamaica.

02:15:46.020 --> 02:15:47.020
Max Drunk.

02:15:47.020 --> 02:15:51.020
Actually, that's more like, probably high, and like, smoking all that reefer.

02:15:51.020 --> 02:15:53.980
Right now you guys I totally feel like I'm at a rave oh

02:15:57.620 --> 02:16:00.100
Yeah, I'm so fucked up right now. Oh

02:16:01.340 --> 02:16:03.980
God give me a hug give me a hug. Oh

02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:06.880
You my bro

02:16:07.300 --> 02:16:11.720
Jamie yeah, I need a hug. What's up, DJ?

02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:14.620
Excuse me, but I thought the word of the night was porn.

02:16:14.620 --> 02:16:17.520
I wanted to rave, baby.

02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:19.520
You're already raving.

02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:21.520
I'll do it all night.

02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:23.020
Do it with me.

02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:24.720
Oh, yeah, pornography.

02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:27.720
Something I will not be experiencing for a long time.

02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:28.720
Wah, I cry.

02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:31.020
No, I thought you were supposed to let

02:16:31.020 --> 02:16:33.720
me know where I can get my man porn from.

02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:35.720
I'm going to talk about porn about church.

02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:37.720
Someone's talking all about porn.

02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:41.520
Speaking of porn, when I went to church earlier today,

02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:44.560
The priest was all talking about porn!

02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:46.240
What was the priest...

02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:48.280
What was the priest saying about porn?

02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:52.160
How some of us were staring at the

02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:54.000
internet, looking at porn.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:55.560
How some of us were

02:16:55.560 --> 02:17:00.280
looking at sexual desires of people in raves, parades, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:05.320
How he's all talking about porn in front of the little kid. And how he likes it.

02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:07.520
I'm not sure if priests actually do porn, but...

02:17:07.520 --> 02:17:13.360
It's getting hot in here, so take off all your clothes.

02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:16.040
Oh, those pastors, those preachers, man.

02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:20.520
Yeah, masturbation on the holy cross, oh my god.

02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:22.220
What?

02:17:22.220 --> 02:17:23.840
On the wish cup.

02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:28.560
That's blasphemy. No, go to that site with the cross-shaped vibrator.

02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:31.360
What? The Jesus suppository? No, they have

02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:35.680
vibrators, dildos, one of them is the shape of the cross.

02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:42.680
And the other one is Jesus and the other one is Mary.

02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:47.920
Can we talk about Mormonism with Brad? I'll tell you all you need to know.

02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:54.480
Matt is worried about hearing

02:17:54.480 --> 02:17:59.000
the words Sky and Loki. Hey, Brad, what do Mormons think of gays?

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:02.540
We think you're great. And the reason why

02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:08.540
It's because it leaves more women to have wives with, so we can have multiple wives.

02:18:08.540 --> 02:18:13.540
There's more free women, because of all you fags.

02:18:13.540 --> 02:18:21.540
What about lesbians? Lesbians? Well, that's not so good, because then there's less women to have the multiple wives with.

02:18:21.540 --> 02:18:25.540
Okay. What do Mormons think of DDR?

02:18:25.540 --> 02:18:31.540
Mormons created DDR. This is what you don't understand. Have you heard of the Illuminati?

02:18:31.540 --> 02:18:42.540
When I die and have my own planet, will I have DDR all over my planet if I'm a Mormon?

02:18:42.540 --> 02:18:52.540
You know, when I die, I always wanted to leave elaborate instructions of what to do with my body, so elaborate that they wouldn't be able to be done.

02:18:52.540 --> 02:18:59.540
I want my ashes spread throughout the ventilation system of a major high-rise building.

02:18:59.540 --> 02:19:05.540
Let me tell you something about Mormonism.

02:19:05.540 --> 02:19:15.540
Wait, Brad, this is what I want to know about when it comes to Mormons. Tell us about the magical underwear.

02:19:15.540 --> 02:19:18.540
Oh, the magical drawls?

02:19:18.540 --> 02:19:22.540
I don't know anything about them.

02:19:22.540 --> 02:19:24.540
Come on, tell us about the magical underwear.

02:19:24.540 --> 02:19:25.540
That's classified information.

02:19:25.540 --> 02:19:34.540
If you were to see me in my magical underwear, you would burn.

02:19:34.540 --> 02:19:40.540
What happens if you get skid marks in your magical underwear, do you go to hell?

02:19:40.540 --> 02:19:48.540
No, you have to take them to the Christian dry cleaning center, and they take care of that action.

02:19:48.540 --> 02:19:59.540
So, I know this is going to be so freaking dorky, but the movie Chicago, pretty good movie, they had a reference to Mormonism in there that was pretty damn funny. So everybody should go see that movie.

02:20:01.540 --> 02:20:11.540
You guys should just go see that movie because it really kicks ass and there's a scene when they're doing a press conference and then they cut to the scene and it's just really awesome.

02:20:11.540 --> 02:20:18.020
awesome. The choreograph, the makeup, everything about it. I still think that Dan has the best

02:20:18.020 --> 02:20:20.740
Mormon joke ever. The mighty Mormon Power Rangers.

02:20:20.740 --> 02:20:27.100
You know, I hate the film industry and their horrible attempts at sequels. For instance,

02:20:27.100 --> 02:20:30.940
they're making a sequel to Beetlejuice that's going to be Beetlejuice, trapped in some sort

02:20:30.940 --> 02:20:36.300
of netherworld place, and he meets up with the urban version of himself, possibly played

02:20:36.300 --> 02:20:39.500
by John Leguizamo or Chris Rock.

02:20:39.500 --> 02:20:40.500
Michael Keaton.

02:20:40.500 --> 02:20:42.700
Wait, you mean like the Black Beetlejuice?

02:20:42.700 --> 02:20:45.780
Yes, exactly.

02:20:45.780 --> 02:20:46.780
You know what?

02:20:46.780 --> 02:20:59.100
Chicago isn't a sequel to anything, it's just a remake of a Broadway musical.

02:20:59.100 --> 02:21:03.980
And all the main actors, Richard Gerecatherines, Seta Jones, and Renee Zellweger, all do their

02:21:03.980 --> 02:21:06.940
own singing and dancing, which makes it just even more.

02:21:06.940 --> 02:21:07.940
Oh, hey!

02:21:07.940 --> 02:21:14.380
That reminds me, I actually found, because we get brochures from these really small studios

02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:20.180
at Mark, because my sort of boss right now, she used to deal with all the small studios

02:21:20.180 --> 02:21:25.900
that didn't have a rep, so we got this one, they're advertising for Guys Gone Crazy.

02:21:25.900 --> 02:21:26.900
I want!

02:21:26.900 --> 02:21:31.460
Yes, and I'm buying you guys Guys Gone Crazy, it's really friggin' cheap, so we're buying

02:21:31.460 --> 02:21:32.460
that.

02:21:32.460 --> 02:21:33.460
Are they naked?

02:21:33.460 --> 02:21:36.360
That and Girls Gone, oh what was it, Girls Gone Triple X Wild.

02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:37.360
I want that too.

02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:43.360
I want the girls one, but not the guys, because remember, men suck.

02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:46.360
I want both of them.

02:21:46.360 --> 02:21:49.880
Will we get to see some big black cock?

02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:50.880
Maybe.

02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:51.880
I don't know.

02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:56.480
Did I tell you about the time when I was driving down past the movie theaters and there was

02:21:56.480 --> 02:22:03.900
the car that had the wax stuff written on the back shield that said, we're filming for

02:22:03.900 --> 02:22:10.900
girls gone wild. Show us your titties. Would you have shown your titties Jamie? No. They

02:22:12.260 --> 02:22:19.260
have the logo. They have actual car decals and shit that they can put on there. Are we

02:22:19.860 --> 02:22:23.460
done with this current topic? Because I have an idea for what we can do. Good. I'm just

02:22:23.460 --> 02:22:29.500
fucking hungry. Let's take questions from the chat room. Yes! Alright, so chat room,

02:22:29.500 --> 02:22:31.900
You're going to ask us questions.

02:22:31.900 --> 02:22:36.680
Anything you want to ask us in the chat room, and we'll answer them on air.

02:22:36.680 --> 02:22:37.680
Anything you want to ask us.

02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:40.840
And remember, I'm drunk, so I'm going to be very open right now.

02:22:40.840 --> 02:22:46.080
So ask us a question, and we'll answer it.

02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:50.600
In the meantime, I'm going to open up the mailbag and see if we have anything while

02:22:50.600 --> 02:22:55.680
we're waiting for some questions in the chat room.

02:22:55.680 --> 02:22:56.680
Nothing personal.

02:22:56.680 --> 02:22:58.840
They can't be about a specific other person.

02:22:58.840 --> 02:23:03.440
They can be about one of the three of us, but they can't be about, like, why do we like

02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:04.440
or not like so-and-so.

02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:13.240
Well, okay, I was, now, the only reason I wanted to go to the Rage-

02:23:13.240 --> 02:23:15.920
Oh, wow, I'm getting a ton of stuff over private message, hold on.

02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:16.920
I'm sorry.

02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:22.840
I was going to go to the Rage tonight with Brad and Irene and everybody, but, you know,

02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:27.000
because I have work tomorrow, and we would be out till two in the morning, now, I'm okay

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:30.800
with being out that late, but I'm kind of tired right now because I haven't eaten anything

02:23:30.800 --> 02:23:36.360
all day, so I'm kind of indecisive. But then again, the last time, if everyone remembers

02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:40.720
my story, like last week, I think about the guy trying to proposition me for sex. That

02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:45.880
happened on a Sunday night at the Rage, so I could go and get more material for the show.

02:23:45.880 --> 02:23:52.760
So it's that whole weighing the situation there, but I don't know. Plus, I might see

02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:56.760
See that one? No, that'd be wrong because then I'd be cheating on my girlfriend. No.

02:23:56.760 --> 02:23:59.760
Hey, you can always look at the menu.

02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:07.760
I'm talking about this one chick that used to go, her name was Nicole, she was the one that's like an ex-stripper, like, has things pierced and that kind of thing.

02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:10.760
She used to go to the rage all the time on Sunday nights.

02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:14.760
You should just go to faces on that. I'm getting some material for the show.

02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:16.760
I'm getting questions from the chatroom. You guys ready?

02:24:16.760 --> 02:24:17.760
Yeah, yeah.

02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:19.760
Alright, here we go. First question. Should I get some music for...

02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:20.760
Perry!

02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:24.360

02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:28.920

02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:36.640
yeah i know amazing

02:24:36.640 --> 02:24:40.880
of here we go

02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:43.520
first question

02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:44.680
it was

02:24:44.680 --> 02:24:45.440
all hell

02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:52.440
of what's when what's known as a real bona fide lesbian in the studio

02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:55.680
well since i said one michael and i might as well

02:24:55.680 --> 02:25:00.480
let's be and she handed the microphone tina like she's a bonafide lesbian

02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:03.920
what he about i will get i will tell you the truth there isn't one bonafide

02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:05.800
lesbian in this house

02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:08.320
i'll put my lesbian okay

02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:11.680
mad you'll get a lot of my lesbian

02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:16.200
you're just an alternate universe where he had a sex change

02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:18.400
that's the owner okay

02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:19.640
next question which went

02:25:19.640 --> 02:25:22.560
how come we don't talk about big white car

02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:26.160
because white people don't have big i think you know that's it

02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:30.260
after they're up there with the asian and right there i was easy

02:25:30.260 --> 02:25:32.120
at the heart of the exhibit

02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:34.360
when also alan skin

02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:38.020
and my taxi and he sends a picture of himself i can already tell you the

02:25:38.020 --> 02:25:42.020
The answer is no, but let's open the picture just to humor him.

02:25:42.020 --> 02:25:47.020
Is Twen sexy?

02:25:47.020 --> 02:25:49.020
That's better than the last pic I saw.

02:25:49.020 --> 02:25:53.020
Being honest, he's not, I wouldn't say he's sexy, but he's not ugly.

02:25:53.020 --> 02:25:56.020
He's got an old navy shirt, that's cute.

02:25:56.020 --> 02:25:58.020
He has a chance.

02:25:58.020 --> 02:25:59.020
I wouldn't fuck him, but whatever.

02:25:59.020 --> 02:26:00.020
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

02:26:00.020 --> 02:26:03.020
Everybody stop, stop the show, stop the press, there's an announcement.

02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:04.020
Yes.

02:26:04.020 --> 02:26:07.020
I copped the cola can.

02:26:07.020 --> 02:26:10.020
Can I suck your... Irene, I have a question. Can I suck your dick?

02:26:10.020 --> 02:26:11.020
Yeah, sure!

02:26:11.020 --> 02:26:14.020
Too late, I already did.

02:26:14.020 --> 02:26:16.020
Here we go, moving on.

02:26:16.020 --> 02:26:21.020
Moving on, let's answer some more questions from the chatroom.

02:26:21.020 --> 02:26:26.020
23magus wants to know, where is Mr. Spanky? Mr. Spanky's on hold this week, because he's not popular.

02:26:26.020 --> 02:26:29.020
Mr. Spanky is actually chained up in Rob's closet.

02:26:29.020 --> 02:26:32.020
Twin sent us another pic. He must know if he's sexy in this pic.

02:26:32.020 --> 02:26:38.020
Is that the same closet that holds his clothes monster in it?

02:26:51.020 --> 02:26:52.020
I'd wish.

02:26:52.020 --> 02:27:00.020
I don't think too many people are going to see it, because that's a really fucking awesome comic as is, and I don't think they should've made it a movie.

02:27:00.020 --> 02:27:05.020
I would see it just from the nerdy thing, but I wouldn't go down and say it.

02:27:05.020 --> 02:27:09.020
I would wait until it came to the DVD.

02:27:09.020 --> 02:27:14.020
I don't think it's going to be a make-out flick, I think it's going to be a blowjob in the back row movie.

02:27:14.020 --> 02:27:16.020
I think it's going to be a vomit flick.

02:27:16.020 --> 02:27:19.020
I'm going.

02:27:19.020 --> 02:27:24.220
went through the blood talk. Or maybe just checked the theater flick.

02:27:24.220 --> 02:27:26.020
Okay, we have another question.

02:27:26.020 --> 02:27:31.820
More thanjake543 wants to know, why do my parents cry when I ask them questions?

02:27:31.820 --> 02:27:33.620
That's because you scare them.

02:27:33.620 --> 02:27:36.460
Yeah, take off the mask when you ask them questions.

02:27:36.460 --> 02:27:40.740
Depends on what kind of questions you're asking them. He also wants to know why he's so bored.

02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:45.140
Because you're not drunk like the rest of us. Yes, because you're not drunk like the rest of us.

02:27:45.140 --> 02:27:46.980
Alright, here we go.

02:27:46.980 --> 02:27:50.420

02:27:50.420 --> 02:27:53.300
to see if it gets a call play kind of late in the show here but i just

02:27:53.300 --> 02:27:56.380
remembered something posted it was uh...

02:27:56.380 --> 02:27:59.060
hit the golf when they're stupid just because their parents haven't told them

02:27:59.060 --> 02:28:02.560

02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:04.460
already moving on

02:28:04.460 --> 02:28:06.260
move on her

02:28:06.260 --> 02:28:07.720

02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:16.040

02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:24.720
i'm good at bullshitting

02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:26.320

02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:31.200
bob other than that i just i get a lot of uh... playboy videos to get my work

02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:31.680
again

02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:33.280
a lot of everything actually

02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:36.720
uh... but really i don't own that much porn all

02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:39.420
everything i own a gun for my work so

02:28:39.420 --> 02:28:42.220
that's not saying much

02:28:42.220 --> 02:28:45.460
I just make myself sound like I know a lot more about stuff than I actually do.

02:28:45.460 --> 02:28:46.460
It's pretty cool.

02:28:46.460 --> 02:28:48.500
You fake it.

02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:49.500
Like an orgasm.

02:28:49.500 --> 02:28:50.500
I have had a cry.

02:28:50.500 --> 02:28:53.340
You guys have drank almost all my Midori.

02:28:53.340 --> 02:28:56.020
You want my butt?

02:28:56.020 --> 02:28:57.020
Alright, next question.

02:28:57.020 --> 02:28:58.700
Have you shared your butts on it?

02:28:58.700 --> 02:28:59.700
Change that.

02:28:59.700 --> 02:29:03.260
Chubbs wants to know, when is the next drunk show?

02:29:03.260 --> 02:29:05.260
Tomorrow.

02:29:05.260 --> 02:29:07.060
When I'm drunk and do a fuck off.

02:29:07.060 --> 02:29:09.460
The next drunk show is President's Day, right?

02:29:09.460 --> 02:29:11.100
Or the day before President's Day.

02:29:11.100 --> 02:29:12.100
If I'm off.

02:29:12.100 --> 02:29:13.100
We can get you out.

02:29:13.100 --> 02:29:14.100
Jamie likes to get off.

02:29:14.100 --> 02:29:18.100
Which means that I'll be sleeping on the couch over here.

02:29:18.100 --> 02:29:19.100
Alright.

02:29:19.100 --> 02:29:21.100
Just log in tomorrow, we'll have a drunk show.

02:29:21.100 --> 02:29:24.100
I might have to come for that drunk show.

02:29:24.100 --> 02:29:26.100
I was actually just kidding to get them logged in.

02:29:26.100 --> 02:29:27.100
We have another question.

02:29:27.100 --> 02:29:31.100
C.M. Iguana wants to know what's better, cherry or vanilla coke?

02:29:31.100 --> 02:29:32.100
Vanilla.

02:29:32.100 --> 02:29:34.100
Vanilla coke!

02:29:34.100 --> 02:29:35.100
Vanilla all the way, baby.

02:29:35.100 --> 02:29:36.100
Pepsi.

02:29:36.100 --> 02:29:37.100
But in the can.

02:29:37.100 --> 02:29:39.100
Pepsi Blue is nasty shit.

02:29:39.100 --> 02:29:40.100
Exactly, it blue.

02:29:40.100 --> 02:29:41.100
It blew.

02:29:41.100 --> 02:29:42.100
Whatever happened to Clear Pepsi?

02:29:42.100 --> 02:29:43.100
That shit fucking rocked.

02:29:43.100 --> 02:29:44.100
Crystal Pepsi was the best.

02:29:44.100 --> 02:29:45.100
Crystal Pepsi was the shit.

02:29:45.100 --> 02:29:47.660
I fucking love that and they won't bring it back.

02:29:47.660 --> 02:29:49.820
They still make it I think in some countries though.

02:29:49.820 --> 02:29:50.820
Oh really?

02:29:50.820 --> 02:29:52.060
I'll have to find the link.

02:29:52.060 --> 02:29:54.980
There's a site that has every version of Pepsi they've ever made.

02:29:54.980 --> 02:29:56.300
I think JB is now my god.

02:29:56.300 --> 02:29:58.380
If she can find me that.

02:29:58.380 --> 02:29:59.380

what the hell lucky what is your line of work anyway

02:31:59.160 --> 02:32:06.160
sell movies to video stores. Actually, I'm K-Count Sales for a chain of stores called

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:13.160
Movie Gallery. It's a Midwest, East Coast chain. It's kind of like Blockposter in Hollywood.

02:32:13.160 --> 02:32:18.040
And I talk to stupid shits that work at those stores all day long, and I sell the movies

02:32:18.040 --> 02:32:23.480
and deal with issues that they have like misshippments, shortages, whatnot. So that's what I do, and

02:32:23.480 --> 02:32:28.160
because I do that, I get spits from different studios for selling movies to the stores,

02:32:28.160 --> 02:32:33.640
and i also get uh... you know some of the movies for free

02:32:33.640 --> 02:32:35.000
all right cool

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.320

Why do you stick a baby into a blender feet first?

02:33:01.680 --> 02:33:05.440
So you can see its expression!

02:33:05.440 --> 02:33:07.960
Hahahaha

02:33:07.960 --> 02:33:11.520
That's right folks, kill your kids while they're young so that we don't have to suffer with them.

02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:16.240
Alright, another question. Evil Naoki2DX wants to know why do the dancing cacti

02:33:16.240 --> 02:33:21.880
from the background video of Guacamole Del Taco give me nightmares?

02:33:21.880 --> 02:33:24.000
Because they're out to steal your soul.

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:27.940
because they're playing somebody amigo because after you play that song

02:33:27.940 --> 02:33:29.820

02:36:44.580 --> 02:36:46.580
Okay, I haven't heard it.

02:36:46.580 --> 02:36:48.580
Alright, does that make you want to be all giggly like a damn schooler?

02:36:48.580 --> 02:36:50.580
No, that makes me want to kill people.

02:36:53.580 --> 02:36:54.580
Yeah.

02:36:54.580 --> 02:36:57.580

02:36:57.580 --> 02:37:00.580
No, it just makes me want to look for more hentai.

02:37:01.580 --> 02:37:02.580

Okay, that's one of the Hydra songs I promised I'd play later.

02:37:39.180 --> 02:37:42.180
Ah, VidPowah. This is an excellent question from VidPowah.

02:37:42.180 --> 02:37:47.180
What is up with that guy sitting cross-legged in the Stoic video for 2DX?

02:37:48.180 --> 02:37:49.180
Dude, it's Taq.

02:37:51.180 --> 02:37:53.180
Don't. Question. Taq.

02:37:54.180 --> 02:37:56.180
Fair enough. Fair enough.

02:37:56.180 --> 02:38:01.180
Jack Cookie wants to know if I want his chocolate chips.

02:38:01.180 --> 02:38:05.180
Oh baby, you know it.

02:38:05.180 --> 02:38:10.180
Hydra says, hmm, that's not a question.

02:38:10.180 --> 02:38:15.180
Twin wants to know, no, I'm not going to dignify that question.

02:38:15.180 --> 02:38:20.180
I'm sorry, that's a little bit across the line.

02:38:20.180 --> 02:38:25.180
No, no more dead baby jokes, get over it.

02:38:25.180 --> 02:38:30.180
JB wants to point out that the Ricky Martin song that's on DDREX is redone by SyFam. Thank you.

02:38:30.180 --> 02:38:35.180
By the way, go back to the fuck you music, because I actually do have a fuck you that I have to say.

02:38:35.180 --> 02:38:40.180
No, this is in regards to JB.

02:38:40.180 --> 02:38:42.180
Ummm...

02:38:42.180 --> 02:38:49.180
This is fucked up!

02:39:12.180 --> 02:39:19.180
I got another one. That's all.

02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:24.620
More than Jake wants to know.

02:39:24.620 --> 02:39:28.140
How many roads must a man walk down? 42.

02:39:28.140 --> 02:39:29.460
In a row.

02:39:29.460 --> 02:39:32.460
Why can't I have an afro? Is it because I'm white?

02:39:32.460 --> 02:39:33.460
Yes.

02:39:33.460 --> 02:39:35.780
Good enough.

02:39:35.780 --> 02:39:36.980
Get a perm.

02:39:36.980 --> 02:39:41.980
What is it when I message him with an underscore and then a pipe and an underscore?

02:39:41.980 --> 02:39:45.980
What is that symbol? And I'll type it in the chat room for those that don't know what I'm talking about.

02:39:45.980 --> 02:39:48.980
What is that symbol? That's a middle finger.

02:39:48.980 --> 02:39:51.980
I'm sorry. I'm drunk.

02:39:51.980 --> 02:39:53.980
Did you have a better explanation?

02:39:53.980 --> 02:39:54.980
I had a better explanation, twin.

02:39:54.980 --> 02:39:56.980
Look at your hand. Face your palm toward you.

02:39:56.980 --> 02:39:58.980
Now turn it the other way.

02:39:58.980 --> 02:40:01.980
Fold down your pinky and the finger next to it.

02:40:01.980 --> 02:40:04.980
Fold down your index finger and your thumb.

02:40:04.980 --> 02:40:06.980
This is what everybody is telling you

02:40:09.260 --> 02:40:12.220
Bombay wants to know is the guy in the stoic video tack

02:40:13.780 --> 02:40:16.500
That's the rumor 23rd Magus wants to know

02:40:17.180 --> 02:40:21.620
Jamie would you hunt me down and kill me if I did the stoic video dance during a party?

02:40:22.180 --> 02:40:24.180
To stoic of course. No

02:40:25.220 --> 02:40:27.220
No

02:40:28.220 --> 02:40:32.220
Vidpawa wants to know, do any of you know Para Para Dances?

02:40:32.220 --> 02:40:35.220
Yes, unfortunately, I know about five.

02:40:35.220 --> 02:40:37.220
I've got about seven now.

02:40:39.220 --> 02:40:40.220
I do not.

02:40:40.220 --> 02:40:42.220
JB says tell Jamie how to dance.

02:40:42.220 --> 02:40:45.220
I do not, I just BS everything Para Para Paradise.

02:40:45.220 --> 02:40:46.220
Alright, that's the end of the...

02:40:46.220 --> 02:40:47.220
JB, you're welcome.

02:40:47.220 --> 02:40:50.220
That's it, end of question and answer segment, we're done.

02:40:50.220 --> 02:40:55.220
Now we're gonna play a Bamani original, actually it's not a Bamani song,

02:40:55.220 --> 02:41:00.500
It's an original work by Hydra, who's a new fellow that's been in our chat room lately.

02:41:00.500 --> 02:41:05.060
And after that, we're going to play something from a group called X1, who JB tells me might

02:41:05.060 --> 02:41:06.820
be Papaya under a new name.

02:41:06.820 --> 02:41:07.860
So we'll see.

02:41:07.860 --> 02:41:08.860
We'll play that.

02:41:08.860 --> 02:41:10.500
We'll play those, and then we'll be right back.

02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:12.060
So we'll start this off on an original work.

02:41:12.060 --> 02:41:19.060
DJ HYDRA with HYDRA'S WRATH here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:42:42.060 --> 02:42:49.060
justbask- Awesome. I'm being corrected. This is Miss Papaya, not Papaya, and this is Miss

02:43:12.060 --> 02:43:18.340
the new name is called x1 or so we think and this song is called wet wet wet which is describing

02:43:18.340 --> 02:43:25.340

Holidays just go, if we want love we flow

02:44:39.340 --> 02:44:42.340
I'm not insane, it's only rape

02:44:42.340 --> 02:44:49.340
I'm not a fool, you're out of food It's not my love that makes you sweat

It's the last of our past

02:46:00.280 --> 02:46:01.680
Wet, wet, wet

02:46:01.680 --> 02:46:03.680

02:46:12.680 --> 02:46:42.000
When

02:46:42.000 --> 02:47:05.000
I'm so tired because I haven't eaten anything, I'm just like ugh.

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.920
Well you know some of the boys and girls are going over to Taco Bell.

02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:09.920
I have a boycott against Taco Bell.

02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:11.920
Taco Bell gives me diarrhea.

02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:13.920
I just don't like Mexican food.

02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:15.920
Are you racist?

02:47:15.920 --> 02:47:17.920
No, I just don't like Mexican food.

02:47:17.920 --> 02:47:19.920
It's all good.

02:47:19.920 --> 02:47:21.920
We're getting into the last stretch of the show.

02:47:21.920 --> 02:47:23.920
I'm starting to sober up a little bit.

02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:25.920
I'm still a little dizzy.

02:47:25.920 --> 02:47:27.920
You want to make me another shot, babe?

02:47:27.920 --> 02:47:29.920
Who are you on the phone with, Jamie?

02:47:29.920 --> 02:47:31.920
Jamie's calling her man.

02:47:31.920 --> 02:47:33.920
The man Dan.

02:47:33.920 --> 02:47:35.920
Okay.

02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:38.920
Okay, wait, Jamie's going to get waffles?

02:47:38.920 --> 02:47:40.920
Yeah, I'm getting waffles.

02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:41.920
Are you and Jamie going out for waffles?

02:47:41.920 --> 02:47:42.920
Going out for waffles.

02:47:42.920 --> 02:47:43.920
Where at?

02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:45.920
Probably Denny's because it's the only place I open.

02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:46.920
Oh, that sucks.

02:47:46.920 --> 02:47:49.920
I want to go out waffles instead of going dancing.

02:47:49.920 --> 02:47:50.920
I want to go dancing, but I have to.

02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:57.920
I'm on the prowl because I've been single for far too long and it's time for me to get some nookie.

02:47:57.920 --> 02:48:00.920
Because it's been, oh my god, when was the last time I got laid?

02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:04.920
Not that we want to talk about this on the radio, but I'm drunk, so it's okay.

02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:11.920
Shit. Probably since, like, the end of September? That's sad, huh?

02:48:11.920 --> 02:48:17.920
Yeah, well, unfortunately, when I go to freakin' The Rage on Sunday nights, I don't know what it is.

02:48:17.920 --> 02:48:22.920
But it's like, my ass is a magnet for horny gay guys. I don't know what it is.

02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:24.920
Oh, low-key!

02:48:24.920 --> 02:48:46.920
Oh shit, I spilled on me. What's in this drink, Jamie?

02:48:46.920 --> 02:48:50.600
drink it

02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:54.060
how is it

02:48:54.060 --> 02:48:57.000
Rob's wearing it

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:58.880
okay

02:48:58.880 --> 02:49:02.800
it was sticky I need to wash my hands

02:49:02.800 --> 02:49:06.160
can you guys keep the show going when I go wash my hands yeah it tastes okay

02:49:06.160 --> 02:49:09.240
sorry Rob I'll make you... I look like I peed myself

02:49:09.240 --> 02:49:13.840
Rob looks like he pissed himself you do realize that's the chair that he spilled

02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:17.960
alcohol and rubbed it off with his ass. I cleaned it off.

02:49:17.960 --> 02:49:21.440
Haha, see you sucker!

02:49:21.440 --> 02:49:24.840
Anyways, yeah...

02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:28.120
Um, we should, um...

02:49:28.120 --> 02:49:31.200
Let's play a two person match game.

02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:38.200
Rob spilled blank on his pants.

02:49:38.200 --> 02:49:43.000
I guess. Stupid, you gotta say Rob got blank all over his pants.

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:48.000
When Rob was really drunk, he blinked all over his pants.

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:55.000
Chat room, what did you say? What did Rob do to his pants?

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
I already know what he did to his pants.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
But this is a different situation. We're pretending.

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:00.000
Ah, he's back!

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:01.000
I want waffles!

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
I want waffles too.

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
Dude, he's like, fisting your ass.

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
He was fisting your ass.

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
And you laughed.

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
Did you like it? How does it feel to be this drunk?

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:16.360
Was out in the living room giving her one because um I want to know what did the chatroom think of the drug show

02:50:16.360 --> 02:50:19.880
Should we do this again, or was this a big fat fucking train wreck?

02:50:19.880 --> 02:50:25.160
I should be drunk. I don't think we're ever gonna do this again because it's a train wreck this show had no

02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:31.480
I mean the show as it is has no organization, but this was like even worse Jamie stop making me drinks

02:50:33.800 --> 02:50:38.580
All right one more drink, that's it I need to know what the chatroom thought of this show

02:50:38.580 --> 02:50:39.580
I don't know.

02:50:39.580 --> 02:50:40.580
I don't know what your name is.

02:50:40.580 --> 02:50:41.580
Wow.

02:50:41.580 --> 02:50:42.580
They're actually liking it.

02:50:42.580 --> 02:50:43.580
A name?

02:50:43.580 --> 02:50:44.580
I don't know.

02:50:44.580 --> 02:50:45.580
What is wrong with you guys?

02:50:45.580 --> 02:50:46.580
Oh.

02:50:46.580 --> 02:50:47.580
Okay.

02:50:47.580 --> 02:50:48.580
What's in this drink, Jamie?

02:50:48.580 --> 02:50:49.580
It's the same thing but better.

02:50:49.580 --> 02:50:50.580
It's the same thing that they'd write.

02:50:50.580 --> 02:50:51.580
Drink it.

02:50:51.580 --> 02:50:54.580
I need a minute to re-gather my thoughts.

02:50:54.580 --> 02:50:55.580
Drink.

02:50:55.580 --> 02:50:56.580
You don't have any thoughts.

02:50:56.580 --> 02:50:57.580
Stop pressuring me.

02:50:57.580 --> 02:50:58.580
Hey, Nino, drink.

02:50:58.580 --> 02:50:59.580
Excuse me.

02:50:59.580 --> 02:51:00.580
You won't be cool.

02:51:00.580 --> 02:51:01.580
Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.

02:51:01.580 --> 02:51:02.580
Oh, wait, wait.

02:51:02.580 --> 02:51:03.580
Okay.

02:51:03.580 --> 02:51:05.580
Type! Type! Type!

02:51:08.580 --> 02:51:12.580
EOSFVB is suggesting... suggesting...

02:51:13.580 --> 02:51:15.580
Shut your mouth!

02:51:16.580 --> 02:51:22.580
He's suggesting that we should do an E-Tards episode where we all drop X to see and make out.

02:51:23.580 --> 02:51:25.580
No!

02:51:27.580 --> 02:51:29.580
Maybe a forty-five-year-old!

02:51:29.580 --> 02:51:31.580
I didn't even have a make out with him!

02:51:31.580 --> 02:51:36.760
1, 2, stop laughing.

02:51:36.760 --> 02:51:39.620
He's laughing like a baby.

02:51:39.620 --> 02:51:41.620
You laugh like girl.

02:51:41.620 --> 02:51:45.520
Okay, down the hatch.

02:51:45.520 --> 02:51:46.520
Breathe.

02:51:46.520 --> 02:51:49.240
Rub, don't look at the chat room.

02:51:49.240 --> 02:51:50.240
Close your eyes.

02:51:50.240 --> 02:51:51.240
Close your eyes, close your eyes.

02:51:51.240 --> 02:51:52.240
Close your eyes.

02:51:52.240 --> 02:51:53.240
Drink.

02:51:53.240 --> 02:51:54.240
Okay.

02:51:54.240 --> 02:52:01.240
Rub has the tingly, twitchy look.

02:52:01.240 --> 02:52:08.240
she

02:52:08.960 --> 02:52:11.840
that was this good

02:52:11.840 --> 02:52:14.940
it was it was fine it was i like the last one better actually

02:52:14.940 --> 02:52:17.400
cable

02:52:17.400 --> 02:52:20.800
job says that we promised we do a drug show on president's day he wants to come

02:52:20.800 --> 02:52:21.920
up here

02:52:21.920 --> 02:52:23.800
okay

02:52:23.800 --> 02:52:26.160
he's hoping that if he gets drunk enough

02:52:26.160 --> 02:52:29.040
they he'll have his way with me not

02:52:29.040 --> 02:52:30.660
i'm kidding can i watch

02:52:30.660 --> 02:52:32.660
I'm just trying to piss people off tonight.

02:52:32.660 --> 02:52:37.660
Oh, Vic Powell wants to know when we're going to get a stripper on the show.

02:52:37.660 --> 02:52:38.660
No.

02:52:38.660 --> 02:52:40.660
I'm sorry.

02:52:40.660 --> 02:52:41.660
No.

02:52:41.660 --> 02:52:42.660
Rob.

02:52:42.660 --> 02:52:43.660
Rob.

02:52:43.660 --> 02:52:44.660
Rob.

02:52:44.660 --> 02:52:45.660
I'm sorry.

02:52:45.660 --> 02:52:48.660
But no, you too, Harry.

02:52:48.660 --> 02:52:51.660
Meanie, I'll get a razor.

02:52:51.660 --> 02:52:57.500
We'll get you some Aussie nads.

02:52:57.500 --> 02:52:59.060
Some Aussie man, what?

02:52:59.060 --> 02:53:00.060
Aussie nads.

02:53:00.060 --> 02:53:02.060
I could go for some Aussie, man.

02:53:02.060 --> 02:53:04.060
Do you know what Aussie nads are?

02:53:04.060 --> 02:53:06.060
No.

02:53:06.060 --> 02:53:08.060
Oh wait, nads!

02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:10.060
Hair removal!

02:53:10.060 --> 02:53:12.060
I just didn't know it was Aussie nads.

02:53:12.060 --> 02:53:16.060
I think Stressa wants to come up and get drunk on the next show, too.

02:53:16.060 --> 02:53:20.060
Yes, you can come, but only if I can have my way with you.

02:53:20.060 --> 02:53:22.060
Just kidding.

02:53:22.060 --> 02:53:24.060
I would pay to see that.

02:53:24.060 --> 02:53:29.060
Stressa says that if you take a razor to your balls, it hurts.

02:53:29.060 --> 02:53:31.060
I wouldn't know, I've never shaved down there.

02:53:31.060 --> 02:53:33.060
Wait, did you try to castrate yourself so you'd sound funny?

02:53:33.060 --> 02:53:35.060
I know guys that do, but I just-

02:53:35.060 --> 02:53:37.060
You kind of really wonder how the porn stars do that.

02:53:37.060 --> 02:53:38.060
I mean, I just-

02:53:38.060 --> 02:53:39.060
There's some parts of your body-

02:53:39.060 --> 02:53:41.060
I would not want to take anything sharp like that down there.

02:53:41.060 --> 02:53:45.060
No, there's seriously some parts of your body that you just need to take what God gave you.

02:53:45.060 --> 02:53:48.060
I knew a guy when I lived in Alabama who was a stripper.

02:53:48.060 --> 02:53:49.060
Who-

02:53:49.060 --> 02:53:50.060
Cool.

02:53:50.060 --> 02:53:51.060
Was an epilady.

02:53:51.060 --> 02:53:52.060
Was he gay?

02:53:52.060 --> 02:53:53.060
Huh?

02:53:53.060 --> 02:53:54.060
Was he hot?

02:53:54.060 --> 02:53:55.060
He was the one I dated.

02:53:55.060 --> 02:53:57.060
You dated a gay guy?

02:54:27.060 --> 02:54:30.060
and that would get ingrown hairs, because the thing was so shitty.

02:54:30.060 --> 02:54:35.060
Could you imagine if you got ingrown hairs on your balls? That would be the worst thing ever.

02:54:35.060 --> 02:54:36.060
Yeah.

02:54:36.060 --> 02:54:43.060
Um, what was I going to say? I have Jackass the movie. Someone mentioned we should do a Jackass video.

02:54:43.060 --> 02:54:44.060
I've got the movie!

02:54:44.060 --> 02:54:46.060
Fuck Jackass the movie! Fuck it!

02:54:46.060 --> 02:54:48.060
He's like a toy car possessed.

02:54:48.060 --> 02:54:51.060
What's the one on your paper now? Is that the fortune cookie?

02:54:51.060 --> 02:54:53.060
I think it is.

02:54:53.060 --> 02:55:00.260
Are we there yet?

02:55:00.260 --> 02:55:07.100
Are we there yet?

02:55:07.100 --> 02:55:12.240
Are we there yet?

02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:16.640
Are we there yet?

02:55:16.640 --> 02:55:18.520
Are we there yet?

02:55:18.520 --> 02:55:21.920
Are we there yet?

02:55:21.920 --> 02:55:25.840
you better have something good to say. Yeah, that'd be good. In the meantime, we'll start

02:55:25.840 --> 02:55:29.440
with the final thoughts while I'm waiting to see what that's gonna be. Jonas, tell us

02:55:29.440 --> 02:55:36.840
your final thought of the day. Explicit. Well, I haven't spoken much in the radio. We're

02:55:36.840 --> 02:55:41.320
not real radio. We're not real radio, we're in a net radio. Okay, just to say that. Most

02:55:41.320 --> 02:55:47.120
of this shows like mainly drunk. Drunk revolution or something like that. With you drinking

02:55:47.120 --> 02:55:59.740
I've made out with anybody.

02:55:59.740 --> 02:56:02.980
Maybe when I go to the club I'll get to make out with some folks, that'll be fun.

02:56:02.980 --> 02:56:06.700
Yeah, I did get to grow boobies, so thank you, James.

02:56:06.700 --> 02:56:12.740
Since I can't be on the show Sunday, or next Sunday afterwards, it depends on my schedule

02:56:12.740 --> 02:56:17.740
But an explosion, my upcoming school that's just starting right now, is about to start on Tuesday.

02:56:17.740 --> 02:56:22.740
Well, I'll probably be there next February.

02:56:22.740 --> 02:56:27.740
Alright.

02:56:27.740 --> 02:56:32.740
And let's see, thoughts about today.

02:56:32.740 --> 02:56:37.740
Alright, dead air.

02:56:37.740 --> 02:56:47.740
I need to stop playing Animal Crossing and finish my website so I can get stuff for people to download and save.

02:57:07.740 --> 02:57:10.740
Alright, that's cool. I'll accept that.

02:57:14.740 --> 02:57:26.740
Yeah, we need strippers on the show. Actually, I need to make a trip over to the strip club because it's been a long time and I was actually reading reviews last night of strip clubs and supposedly at school clubs you get the seemiest lap dances there.

02:57:27.740 --> 02:57:30.740
Strippers? I can hire a few strippers.

02:57:31.740 --> 02:57:33.740
We need to do Orange Lounge Live from the strip club.

02:57:33.740 --> 02:57:34.740
Wait until I'm not here.

02:57:34.740 --> 02:57:43.740
I'm sorry, but I would rather see real boobs than fake boobs. I think that real boobs are better.

02:57:43.740 --> 02:57:47.740
I'll just get some people with real boobs. I don't even go with the fake.

02:57:47.740 --> 02:57:49.740
If I can touch it, it's real enough for me.

02:57:49.740 --> 02:57:54.740
It's like that's the story. Your breasts feel so weird because they're real.

02:57:54.740 --> 02:57:59.740
I've actually touched real boobs and fake boobs before.

02:57:59.740 --> 02:58:01.740
Is there a difference?

02:58:01.740 --> 02:58:03.740
Well, the fake boots.

02:58:31.740 --> 02:58:37.380
like a little unnaturally firm it's just I don't know it's just not soft it's just

02:58:37.380 --> 02:58:42.700
firm silicone difference between a wave less water bed and a regular water bed

02:58:42.700 --> 02:58:51.380
I've just had a regular waterbed so I would imagine probably yeah well I haven't

02:58:51.380 --> 02:58:57.380
touched a brisk for a while but I hear now though they have the ones that you

02:58:57.380 --> 02:59:00.380
You know, they do feel natural. I've never felt that way.

02:59:00.380 --> 02:59:01.380
Bluesaunt?

02:59:01.380 --> 02:59:08.380
I'm never going to have a need for any type of enhancements, so I have to ask these questions. I'll never find out on my own.

02:59:08.380 --> 02:59:10.380
Yes, just stay natural.

02:59:10.380 --> 02:59:16.380
Well, my girlfriend, she's still got, like, you know, issues with her self-image, where she thinks she's...

02:59:16.380 --> 02:59:20.380
She says she wants to get her boobs done, but I was like, no, you don't need them.

02:59:20.380 --> 02:59:21.380
Why? What's wrong with her boobs?

02:59:21.380 --> 02:59:23.380
If she put on 10 pounds, she'd gain more boobs.

02:59:23.380 --> 02:59:24.380
What's wrong with the boobs?

02:59:24.380 --> 02:59:27.380
She doesn't want to do that. She wants to be thin with bigger breasts.

02:59:27.380 --> 02:59:32.380
I'm saying she doesn't need to do that, but she wants to.

02:59:32.380 --> 02:59:34.380
Go ahead. I'm not going to stop her.

02:59:34.380 --> 02:59:39.380
You know, actually, from my experience working at GNC and everything,

02:59:39.380 --> 02:59:44.380
there are actually some herbs that you can take that increase your hormones and increase your breast size.

02:59:44.380 --> 02:59:45.380
We all know about that.

02:59:45.380 --> 02:59:48.380
She's taking enough drugs as it is right now.

02:59:48.380 --> 02:59:50.380
It's all natural.

02:59:50.380 --> 02:59:53.380
We're running long, so I just need to get everybody's final thought.

02:59:53.380 --> 02:59:55.380
Are you doing any final thought, Logie?

02:59:55.380 --> 02:59:56.380
Yes.

02:59:56.380 --> 02:59:57.380
Jamie?

02:59:57.380 --> 02:59:58.380
Um...

02:59:58.380 --> 02:59:59.380
Bye.

02:59:59.380 --> 03:00:03.700
My final thought is I'm drunk as fuck, and we're not going to be doing this again for

03:00:03.700 --> 03:00:04.700
a long time.

03:00:04.700 --> 03:00:05.700
Chubs, you suck.

03:00:05.700 --> 03:00:08.740
You were supposed to be here drinking with me, but no, I understand the poor thing, because

03:00:08.740 --> 03:00:09.980
I'm poor too.

03:00:09.980 --> 03:00:12.580
And uh... that's it for now.

03:00:12.580 --> 03:00:17.380
Um, actually, I might get really drunk tonight when I get home, and go live.

03:00:17.380 --> 03:00:18.380
Until 2am.

03:00:18.380 --> 03:00:19.380
Oh, wow.

03:00:19.380 --> 03:00:26.140
It's actually the station is gonna be live until well you'll have to you'll have to try and kick me off

03:00:26.140 --> 03:00:29.840
I think but I'm gonna be going out. So when I get back though, you can go live. I don't know

03:00:35.140 --> 03:00:38.260
All right, anyway, yeah, I think that's it for now

03:00:38.260 --> 03:00:40.260
anything else?

03:00:40.260 --> 03:00:42.260
Not that I know of, everything's fine

03:00:42.260 --> 03:00:46.260
Alright, hope you enjoyed the drunk show boys and girls, that's it, we're signing off

03:00:53.260 --> 03:00:56.260

03:01:12.360 --> 03:01:14.960
Heed! Paper! Now!

03:01:14.960 --> 03:01:18.160
Move that melon of yours and get the paper if you can.

03:01:18.160 --> 03:01:21.760
Pulling that gargantuan cranium about.

03:01:21.760 --> 03:01:24.560
I'm not kidding, that boy's head's like Sputnik.

03:01:24.560 --> 03:01:27.560
Spherical, but quick, point to your pants.

03:01:27.560 --> 03:01:29.760
Well, that was offside, wasn't it?

03:01:29.760 --> 03:01:33.760
