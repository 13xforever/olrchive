00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

00:12.000 --> 00:20.360
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, The Mani Talk, and then some.

00:20.360 --> 00:27.360
Orange Lounge may contain adult content. Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.360
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

00:30.360 --> 00:34.360
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

00:34.360 --> 00:37.360
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex. In this episode...

00:42.360 --> 00:44.360
Hey, are there any balls down there?

00:44.360 --> 00:46.360
That's the biggest berry you've ever seen, Jingle Berry.

00:46.360 --> 00:49.360
What's your favorite scary movie?

00:49.360 --> 00:53.360
Showgirls. Absolute frightful. What's yours?

00:53.360 --> 00:56.360
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

00:56.360 --> 00:59.360
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

00:59.360 --> 01:02.360
Now's the time on sprockets and we dance!

01:02.360 --> 01:05.360
I don't get you, my pretty. And your little dog, too.

01:05.360 --> 01:07.360
I don't come through.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.360
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:09.360 --> 01:12.360
Why did they have to take the word gay?

01:13.360 --> 01:17.360
No! What he expects us to punish him with a shot is Hindu.

01:17.360 --> 01:19.360
Hey!

01:21.360 --> 01:25.360
Shut up! Where's my gun? This is my boomstick.

01:25.360 --> 01:31.360
Sky. Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb. Loki. I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

01:31.360 --> 01:37.360
What kind of war human being would find that funny? Orange Lounge Radio.

01:38.360 --> 01:45.360
You are tuned in to the Bamani Scene's most stylish radio station of all things Ben Money.

01:58.360 --> 02:02.360
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers, also known as Star Trek.

02:02.360 --> 02:03.360

Hi!

06:33.500 --> 06:34.500
Oh my God!

06:34.500 --> 06:35.500
You've got mail!

06:35.500 --> 06:50.500
During my service in the United States at the time, I took the initiative in creating

06:50.500 --> 06:52.500
an internet.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.500
You bastards!

06:54.500 --> 07:00.000
in the United States of Congress, and I put the initiative in creating the Internet.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
You bastards!

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
But you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you?

07:07.000 --> 07:13.000
I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food truck whopper!

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Please, good people, I am in hate.

07:15.000 --> 07:23.000
You are in the dark black forest of Orange Lawn's radio. Here we are.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.040

07:34.400 --> 07:35.880
you guys made some new promos for us

07:35.880 --> 07:39.240
what was going through your mind when you were making those, why did you decide to make promos

07:39.240 --> 07:42.360
what was up with those, it was just random and hey look

07:42.360 --> 07:46.340
it sounds good, alright sounds good, hi Angel how you doing

07:46.340 --> 07:50.640
no comment

07:50.640 --> 07:54.640
Wait, what was I supposed to say?

07:54.640 --> 08:01.640
Alright, first off, as I promised in the chat room, tonight we are bringing back the word of the day.

08:01.640 --> 08:07.640
You remember when we did rave and we had the sandstorm? Jamie, tell us all about tonight's word of the day.

08:07.640 --> 08:13.640
I think we decided on this one. The word of the day is slut.

08:13.640 --> 08:14.640
The word of the day is slut.

08:14.640 --> 08:17.640
And whenever we say the word slut, you get this

08:24.640 --> 08:26.640
The biggest slut in the world, Politary

08:26.640 --> 08:30.640
I don't want to hear Politary over and over and over again

08:30.640 --> 08:31.640
No

08:31.640 --> 08:33.640
So just don't say slut

08:33.640 --> 08:35.640
Oh, you said slut

08:35.640 --> 08:42.640
uh...

08:45.520 --> 08:49.040
baby will kill you

08:49.040 --> 08:52.840
okay shit so now you all know if it is the secret to grow the word of the day

08:52.840 --> 08:56.080
and we're allowed to do that now because the band the years over so the bands

08:56.080 --> 08:59.840
over so we can play a political as much as we want to see what's next new band

08:59.840 --> 09:01.120
you want to be a m

09:01.120 --> 09:05.200
they have all figured out here yay okay voluntary is bad for orange lounge for

09:05.200 --> 09:09.740
another year but i think that they do a thing that will consider

09:09.740 --> 09:10.500
all right

09:10.500 --> 09:12.960
that you've got to say things to do a mike or else they don't hear it on the

09:12.960 --> 09:14.200
radio

09:14.200 --> 09:16.940
by the sharp all right sharp object

09:16.940 --> 09:18.940
word okay so i think when you stick

09:18.940 --> 09:22.200
we need to go back to a time warp here we need to go back to two weeks with

09:22.200 --> 09:24.160
jamie by the way is what you're acting

09:24.160 --> 09:25.300
lovely

09:25.300 --> 09:29.440
lovely job last week i i didn't get any of the whole so i heard that that was

09:29.440 --> 09:32.480
the whole time. I didn't hear that because of all the propelling. You know what? I get

09:32.480 --> 09:35.600
the same problem. When I drink Propel and play DDR, that's like instant pee. I went

09:35.600 --> 09:41.520
through three bottles of Propel that show. Were they all berrylicious? Uh-huh. Alright,

09:41.520 --> 09:46.640
cool. I have nuts stuck in my teeth, sorry. Whoa! Whoa! Me too! How come we haven't heard

09:46.640 --> 09:51.200
from Loki? Where's Loki? Oh, you're right there, okay. That's because I don't have a

09:51.200 --> 09:56.840
chair and I'm sitting on the floor without a mic. I thought you liked getting to pet

09:56.840 --> 10:06.980
the rug here. That's a wrong rug, I think. Don't you like petting rug? Uh, yes. Okay.

10:06.980 --> 10:11.740
Are you a rug munchkin? We need to time warp back to two weeks ago. We did the last show.

10:11.740 --> 10:16.220
Only on the weekends. Oh, then up came the weekend. Loki and I, we took a little road

10:16.220 --> 10:25.940
trip. We went down to SoCal. Bit or a table of one? Bitches. We went down to SoCal and

10:25.940 --> 10:30.140
we were there and we have a little summary of it. Right? We're going to play this bit?

10:30.140 --> 10:34.660
Yeah. Alright, let's see. Let's see if this works here. Our live piece. Well, not our

10:34.660 --> 10:36.900
live piece, but our somewhat live piece. A week delayed.

10:36.900 --> 10:41.100
I don't want to know about your piece. I'm going to go back to eating my nuts.

10:41.100 --> 10:44.900
Anyway, enjoy this bit from SoCal. I can never reach.

10:44.900 --> 10:50.300
First here on Orange Lawns Radio. So here it is, the taped garbage part of the

10:50.300 --> 10:56.760
show. As you may or may not know, last week, Loki and I decided to take a little trip,

10:56.760 --> 11:00.900
and we decided to visit Southern California. And with me here, of course, is Loki. Say

11:00.900 --> 11:01.900
hello.

11:01.900 --> 11:02.900
Hey, everybody.

11:02.900 --> 11:08.300
Now, describe for us, Matt, since I'm not a very good speaker, what kind of place are

11:08.300 --> 11:09.300

11:09.300 --> 11:16.620
We're in the giant mall that I wish we had. Yes, we are so very unprivileged up in NorCal.

11:16.620 --> 11:23.500
This mall is just huge, and there's giant lights in the sky, neon lights everywhere, it is paradise, definitely.

11:23.500 --> 11:29.680
And they got lots of shops, and they have a frickin' anime shop! Why don't we have a frickin' anime shop up in Norical? That sucks.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.720
And they have a Dave & Buster's. That's pretty cool.

11:32.720 --> 11:35.740
Yes, overpriced games. Woo-hoo, but they had a...

11:35.740 --> 11:37.680
What was that derby game?

11:37.680 --> 11:39.340
Derby Owner's Club.

11:39.340 --> 11:41.500
The hot new Milpitas game.

11:41.500 --> 11:45.620
It was fun. I jacked someone's horse, so that was kinda cool.

Oh, well, I think she lost her GameCube pen. What do you have to say about that?

16:52.300 --> 16:56.300
Hey, I was right!

16:56.300 --> 17:00.300
So, let's see, what else can we

17:00.300 --> 17:04.300
talk about here in the little SoCal segment? What are we going to do with the rest of the time

17:04.300 --> 17:08.300
here in SoCal? Well, one thing we're going to do tomorrow is check out AI

17:08.300 --> 17:12.300
because it's rumored that they're going to get DDR Extreme there, so hopefully they will.

17:12.300 --> 17:16.300
We got to see the crazy whore. It was rumored that what was in Cyberzone

17:16.300 --> 17:26.540
going to get it yesterday and obviously it wasn't. Omaha, Nebraska. Freaking Omaha, dude.

17:26.540 --> 17:32.780
If I ever have a band, I'm naming it Freaking Omaha. Instead of Max II and the Aussie Landers,

17:32.780 --> 17:42.500
this time we got Xtreme and the Rednecks. Yeehaw. I'm just not very happy with that.

17:42.500 --> 17:46.500
Hey, we got our 2DX machine when we come back, so that's kind of cool.

17:46.500 --> 17:50.500
And there was a fellow from Omaha that came out to Shaft, so you know, he wasn't right

17:50.500 --> 17:55.500
neck at all, he was a very cool guy, so I'm happy for the, I'm happy yet insane with jealousy

17:55.500 --> 17:57.500
for those folks in Omaha, what can you say?

17:57.500 --> 17:58.500
Not anymore.

17:58.500 --> 18:03.500
And I got to see definitely a bunch of cool stuff, you know, that one mall we went to

18:03.500 --> 18:09.500
was pretty sweet in Little Tokyo, and I got to spend money, and I bought models and cool

18:09.500 --> 18:11.500
stuff.

18:11.500 --> 18:15.500
Cool. Any words of advice for things we should do while we're in SoCal or the places we should go?

18:15.500 --> 18:18.500
You are the resident expert right now, at least out of the three of us.

18:19.500 --> 18:24.500
This isn't the biggest mall. You still haven't been to some of the biggest malls we have around here.

18:24.500 --> 18:28.500
You should go to The Block. You should honestly go to The Block. That place is huge.

18:28.500 --> 18:31.500
Okay, but what other mall has a giant glowing phallic symbol?

18:32.500 --> 18:33.500
I don't know.

18:33.500 --> 18:38.640
there's this giant glowing green thing and oh my god now it's red and it glows

18:38.640 --> 18:42.760
and it looks like and look at the little tip it's even got a little tip and I

18:42.760 --> 18:47.720
took some pictures though while we were down here oh I gotta mention this really

18:47.720 --> 18:54.560
cool game I played yesterday okay this game involves a monkey running around on

18:54.560 --> 18:59.560
a grid undressing a woman I know how weird that sounds that was a bucket

18:59.560 --> 19:04.200
But it was so addicting, it was better in DDR.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.880
Anyway, it was really cool, it was a lot of fun.

19:06.880 --> 19:10.360
And afterwards, you get 15 seconds to zoom in and Google

19:10.360 --> 19:12.360
the woman.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.240
Yeah, fun.

19:15.240 --> 19:16.960
All right, we better wrap up this segment

19:16.960 --> 19:18.440
and get back to the real show.

19:18.440 --> 19:21.240
But we have to ask SoCalKicks, because we always

19:21.240 --> 19:23.480
ask the hosts of the show whenever it's over.

19:23.480 --> 19:25.000
We always go around the three of us,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.160
and we always say our final thoughts of the day,

19:27.160 --> 19:29.440
and any guests that happen to be in the studio.

19:29.440 --> 19:33.360
So I'm just going to ask SoCalKicks, what are your final thoughts of the day?

19:33.360 --> 19:36.360
Loki gives the best hookups.

19:36.360 --> 19:40.160
He also gives the best... Never mind, we're going to go back to the show now. Good night!

19:40.160 --> 19:42.120
No, wait! Hey, hey!

19:42.120 --> 19:43.720
Alright, one, two, three, four!

19:43.720 --> 19:46.720
Alright.

19:46.720 --> 19:51.760
I think I said something like, uh, no, I do not! I don't know what you're talking about!

19:51.760 --> 19:55.320
That is wrong and very disgusting.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.280
And you enjoy it.

19:56.280 --> 19:59.840
Uh, big thank you to our buddy SoCalKicks for spending some time with us.

19:59.840 --> 20:02.440
Let me proof you get a pen.

20:02.440 --> 20:05.440
If you really want a pen now, I can send you a Bic.

20:05.440 --> 20:06.720
A Bic?

20:06.720 --> 20:09.320
Yeah, buy a box of Bic. You're gonna flick your Bic?

20:09.320 --> 20:14.240
I'm gonna flick my Bic. Dude, Brad's pen glows.

20:14.240 --> 20:15.960
It's a Rayvar pen.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.560
Ooh, I wanna take E and make out with everybody.

20:18.560 --> 20:19.400
Brad!

20:19.400 --> 20:25.200
Don't you be turning into a slut on me!

20:25.200 --> 20:26.200
I said slugs.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.200
You said it on purpose.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.200
Nobody heard it.

20:28.200 --> 20:29.200
Alright.

20:29.200 --> 20:37.760
So, then also, what happened when Loki and I were gone, that Friday is when, here in

20:37.760 --> 20:42.920
Orange Lounge World Headquarters in Sacramento, finally, 2DX8 style lands here in Sacramento.

20:42.920 --> 20:47.280
I know you guys talked about this on the show last week, so I won't go too far into it,

20:47.280 --> 20:50.800
but 8 styles here, it rules, the end.

20:50.800 --> 20:58.120
This week, Xtreme started spreading like a bad case of VD all around California.

20:58.120 --> 21:03.160
And it made its way to Stockton last night, so we took a trip down to Stockton Golf Land,

21:03.160 --> 21:06.720
as I call it for short, GAG, Ghetto Ass Golf Land.

21:06.720 --> 21:10.520
And we went down to GAG to play DDRXtreme.

21:10.520 --> 21:17.520
So five of us went, the three of us hosts, and Angel's Trace all went.

21:17.520 --> 21:21.520
What do you want to say about, specifically what do you want to say about DDRXtreme?

21:21.520 --> 21:22.520
Because I know there's lots of people listening going,

21:22.520 --> 21:24.520
It's extreme!

21:24.520 --> 21:26.520
I don't know, I felt that Frozen Ray was me.

21:26.520 --> 21:31.520
Shame on Goughland for getting a bootleg! Bad bad!

21:31.520 --> 21:33.520
They had the most ghetto marking.

21:33.520 --> 21:37.520
They took the DDR, um, the 7th mix sign that was up there,

21:37.520 --> 21:39.520
and they put a big sign over that said,

21:39.520 --> 21:41.520
Extreme DDR 8th!

21:41.520 --> 21:43.520
8th mix, because they're stupid.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.520
Stupid people.

21:45.520 --> 21:49.520
I wish it had said a turd mix. I would have paid so much money for it.

21:49.520 --> 21:53.520
I'll make one for him.

21:53.520 --> 21:57.520
So what do you guys think? What did you guys think of Max 2?

21:57.520 --> 22:01.520
Ah, fuck DDR. What did you think of

22:01.520 --> 22:05.520
Extreme in comparison to Max 2?

22:05.520 --> 22:09.520
It's Max 2 Plus. That's exactly what I thought. It's just

22:09.520 --> 22:13.520
DDR Max 2 Plus. Uh, no?

22:13.520 --> 22:21.520
Um, let's see. There's a few things, uh, a few things I was disappointed on is the Oni remixes that they had in Max 2 that were supposed to be playable now.

22:21.520 --> 22:30.520
They only had one set of steps, and that was the Oni steps. So, ooh, thanks for going all the way and, uh, giving us, you know, new steps for those.

22:30.520 --> 22:36.520
Um, some of the new songs I just didn't really care for. There was a really cool pop music one that was like-

22:36.520 --> 22:43.620
in a bag. You know what? I didn't see, except for you, Rob. No one else played that fucking

22:43.620 --> 22:48.840
song. I wanted to do something fucked up my last stage, so I'm like, I'll do the big hot

22:48.840 --> 22:53.760
air song. No one played that song. Actually, I was looking at the top three songs for 321

22:53.760 --> 23:02.580
Stars, Vanity Angel, surprise, and Tears. Those are the only. Now that was the thing

23:02.580 --> 23:08.060
I liked about extreme is that the videos they keep getting better the video for stoic was pretty funny because it's just like the 2d

23:08.060 --> 23:10.060
X1 except as the afro guy doing it and

23:10.820 --> 23:14.060
They said the video. What were some other songs? I actually played

23:14.060 --> 23:18.820
I did the I do I do I do and it had this whole little like retro thing going on with all these little pictures

23:18.820 --> 23:20.820
of hot little Asian girls and

23:21.380 --> 23:27.140
Speed over Beethoven at Beethoven running all around all this other best video one of the best videos has to be for legend of

23:27.140 --> 23:30.900
Max with the guys running in the background shit like that. I was off. Oh my god

23:30.900 --> 23:33.900
No, I liked the one for Jet World.

23:33.900 --> 23:34.900
That was cool.

23:34.900 --> 23:37.900
I wish they had the singing ladies with the humongous heads.

23:37.900 --> 23:42.900
That was beautiful, Jamie.

23:42.900 --> 23:46.900
Talk about non-core.

23:46.900 --> 23:50.900
Personally, in my opinion, Extreme was just, yeah.

23:50.900 --> 23:52.900
Extreme was little.

23:52.900 --> 23:53.900
Yeah, that too.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.900
It just, it's with more shit.

23:55.900 --> 24:00.580
I I just it's hard for me to get excited about extreme. There's nothing that

24:01.980 --> 24:05.280
Exciting in it who somebody's making this room a disco over here with lights

24:06.760 --> 24:08.760
How about eight style? Yeah, whoo

24:09.700 --> 24:13.540
Yeah, eight styles much cooler. Yeah, I wish though

24:13.540 --> 24:17.020
I remember way back when they showed that there was like a joke picture

24:17.100 --> 24:20.220
That someone had made like a giant 2d x-pad to play with their feet

24:21.960 --> 24:23.960
They should do like one of those

24:23.960 --> 24:31.960
To hell with all you and your stupid 2DX. 2DX sucks ass. All of you suck ass.

24:31.960 --> 24:33.960
Thank you, shut up.

24:33.960 --> 24:36.960
Super strong, no less.

24:36.960 --> 24:41.960
All I know about Xtreme is it's just a green Max 2.

24:41.960 --> 24:47.960
Yeah, it's a green Max 2 with twice as many songs, with more modes, and more options, and more difficulty.

24:47.960 --> 24:52.480
It's just the same damn game. Hey, it's actually it's the first base with 230 songs in it. Yeah

24:53.880 --> 24:59.020
They'll all get played out. Wait call it beat mania because that's what it really is. It's just beat mania, right?

24:59.020 --> 25:04.860
No, it's beat mania. It's beat mania. I don't know. It looks like Street Fighter. You know, it's got pixels

25:04.860 --> 25:08.840
It's on a monitor you push buttons. It's all the same, you know now granted

25:08.840 --> 25:12.920
I haven't played extreme yet, but how can everyone got all excited?

25:12.920 --> 25:17.360
you know to go from third style to our third mix to fourth mix and all it was

25:17.360 --> 25:21.160
was just you know added songs and stuff you know they changed a few things here

25:21.160 --> 25:25.440
and there you know but when it goes from max to extreme everyone's just like

25:25.440 --> 25:30.720
we're jaded you know yeah maybe that's it I don't know but we didn't like the

25:30.720 --> 25:36.160
CD banners okay no one liked the discard no one really cared here's a here's a

25:36.160 --> 25:38.160
You know what I like?

25:38.160 --> 25:39.160
Puke it up.

25:39.160 --> 25:46.160
What I did like is that they had the song list, you could divide it by game, that it

25:46.160 --> 25:47.160
came from.

25:47.160 --> 25:52.120
Yeah, see, I know, I mean, like, see, I hear that Extreme has a few new options too and

25:52.120 --> 25:57.000
stuff, but I don't know, like, it seems like everyone got all excited from, you know, transition

25:57.000 --> 26:02.160
from third to fourth, but not from, you know, seventh to eighth, or, you know, I don't know.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.160
Anyway, yeah.

26:03.160 --> 26:09.160
I mean, it's okay just to have, like, new stuff to kind of break the monotony of Max 2 because I can only stand to hear the whistle song so many times, you know?

26:09.160 --> 26:11.160
It's gone. It's gone.

26:11.160 --> 26:12.160
And it's gone.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.160
Well, thank you.

26:13.160 --> 26:14.160
It might be an unlock, but it's good.

26:14.160 --> 26:16.160
Whatever. Whatever.

26:17.160 --> 26:22.160
It's kind of nice just to have some new songs kind of mixed up a little. Like I said, the videos are nice, so it's pretty to watch, but...

26:22.160 --> 26:24.160
I didn't see ghosts come back.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.160
No, ghosts did not come back. I didn't see either.

26:25.160 --> 26:29.160
That pisses me the fuck off. Because I liked playing ghosts.

26:29.160 --> 26:34.480
telephone operator did come back that was pretty cool so anyway and I saw

26:34.480 --> 26:38.780
somebody there playing freckles just so they could get extra stage I'm like

26:38.780 --> 26:45.000
Jesus okay you're playing it to get an extra stage yet you're wasting a stage

26:45.000 --> 26:50.480
to get that extra stage what's up with that well then fuck that it's kind of

26:50.480 --> 26:53.920
weird though because it's now the extra stage you can pick any song you watch

26:53.920 --> 27:05.060
this on reverse 1-5 with butterfly extra stage. That is pretty cool. And heavy. I'd have to

27:05.060 --> 27:10.320
say that, Para Nera Survivor, that was hard. That was fun. I only got about halfway through

27:10.320 --> 27:16.980
on doubles. I owned A on the Oni. I double A'd A. Yeah, you double A'd A on heavy on

27:16.980 --> 27:24.980
On Singles the first time, I passed A on the ONI steps, which are our cata on doubles,

27:24.980 --> 27:26.820
and that was fun.

27:26.820 --> 27:33.980
And Trip Machine Survivor's Easy as Hell, it's a weird fucking song, weird, weird song.

27:33.980 --> 27:38.060
What was that one song, Guacamole?

27:38.060 --> 27:40.900
Gum Land, A Couple.

27:40.900 --> 27:44.820
That song pissed me off, but I was more pissed off because of the situation, everything was

27:44.820 --> 27:46.700
against me.

27:46.700 --> 27:52.700
It had a really crazy-ass cactus in the background.

27:52.700 --> 27:55.700
Yeah, it was pretty cool. The cactus playing Samba was pretty cool.

27:55.700 --> 27:59.700
Like I said, the videos are great. The videos keep getting better and better.

27:59.700 --> 28:07.700
The best fucking background in a DDR game ever has to be A. A has the most kick-ass background image for it.

28:07.700 --> 28:09.700
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

28:09.700 --> 28:12.700
Chat room's asking, what about V? V's video.

28:12.700 --> 28:15.700
I really dug the splash screen for V.

28:15.700 --> 28:22.460
There's Tron walking down the stairs with her all shadowed out with the blue light from

28:22.460 --> 28:23.460
behind.

28:23.460 --> 28:24.460
I don't remember the video itself though.

28:24.460 --> 28:26.760
I think it's just one of those generic rave videos.

28:26.760 --> 28:27.820
Generic random shit.

28:27.820 --> 28:29.180
That's pretty much it.

28:29.180 --> 28:30.440
So there wasn't any special video for that.

28:30.440 --> 28:32.200
I think A didn't have a special video either.

28:32.200 --> 28:35.260
I remember it just had the dude, the Renaissance guy.

28:35.260 --> 28:36.260
Yeah.

28:36.260 --> 28:38.620
Alright, so that's all of our thoughts on Xtreme, anything else?

28:38.620 --> 28:39.620
Yeah!

28:39.620 --> 28:40.620
Angel, you're so quiet over there.

28:40.620 --> 28:42.400
You have anything you want to say about Xtreme?

28:42.400 --> 28:44.960
No, just no.

28:44.960 --> 28:48.960
We're eating death cookies.

28:48.960 --> 28:49.960
Okay!

28:49.960 --> 28:54.960
Murder never tasted better.

28:54.960 --> 28:58.960
They had this really cool Japanese heavy metal song that was in there.

28:58.960 --> 29:03.960
It had this character from Poppy Music in the background dressed up like a samurai.

29:03.960 --> 29:05.960
He looked really evil looking.

29:05.960 --> 29:06.960
So that was kind of cool.

29:06.960 --> 29:07.960
They had that in there.

29:07.960 --> 29:13.960
It was a really awesome heavy metal song.

29:13.960 --> 29:19.040
though. The guy that was playing it was really cool at freestyling, too, so that was kind

29:19.040 --> 29:21.960
of cool to watch.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.800
All right, so I think at this point in the show we're going to take a quick break. Sound

29:24.800 --> 29:26.960
good to you? Anything else you want to say on Extreme, Jamie?

29:26.960 --> 29:30.440
Why is that pizza? Yeah, we've got to go get that.

29:30.440 --> 29:33.560
It was extremely, um, yeah.

29:33.560 --> 29:37.340
No, I wouldn't say it's a waste. I wouldn't by any means say it's a waste. It's a badly

29:37.340 --> 29:42.720
needed upgrade to Max 2, but it doesn't bring anything new into DDR.

29:42.720 --> 29:45.880
That's so completely average.

29:45.880 --> 29:51.880
They didn't put any of the cooler songs from 2DX in. That kind of pisses me off.

29:51.880 --> 29:53.160
Some of them.

29:53.160 --> 29:56.640
A is kind of fun to dance to, but I mean, it's just, it's steps were a little easy.

29:56.640 --> 29:58.560
Although I hear the only ones are harder.

29:58.560 --> 30:02.560
I only played two games. But now I have a decent selection of Tac songs.

30:02.560 --> 30:05.000
They should have put it in Cracker.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.400
Yes!

30:06.400 --> 30:07.440
Tears?

30:07.440 --> 30:08.760
Sucked ass.

30:08.760 --> 30:11.900
Hyper-Eurobeat? I wasn't touching that with a ten foot pole.

30:11.900 --> 30:15.700
and bring the age of those that suck ass

30:15.700 --> 30:20.780
thank you much it speed over beethoven was as fun as people so lots of tax

30:20.780 --> 30:21.780
the tax cool

30:21.780 --> 30:24.080
stoker

30:24.080 --> 30:27.340
uh... one of the songs was name the end

30:27.340 --> 30:29.200

30:29.200 --> 30:33.420

30:33.420 --> 30:40.420
i hate that's what

30:43.420 --> 30:48.040
and i say someone economically every minute until they bring back the whistle

30:48.040 --> 30:49.440
song

30:49.440 --> 30:52.880
when was the show and i hope they never bring that back that's my least favorite

30:52.880 --> 30:55.460
tdr song

30:55.460 --> 30:57.460
has been the school quality

30:57.460 --> 31:01.060
okay we're gonna take a quick break and still is funny when we mentioned miss

31:01.060 --> 31:06.820
Is Muffet getting AIDS?

31:06.820 --> 31:07.820
We're going to come back...

31:07.820 --> 31:11.060
No, I thought that your hooker story was pretty funny.

31:11.060 --> 31:15.540
We're going to come back and do the FUs of the week, so send those to me over in the

31:15.540 --> 31:19.180
chat room, and dear God, we've got a lot of people to get through tonight, so make them

31:19.180 --> 31:20.180

31:20.180 --> 31:24.860
Alright, we'll be back after a quick break featuring those two little letters you all

31:24.860 --> 31:25.860

31:25.860 --> 31:38.580
so

37:25.860 --> 37:35.180
Hello? Hello, is this thing on testing? Testing 1-2?

37:35.180 --> 37:39.220
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

37:39.220 --> 37:43.220
Hello? I don't understand this. Does this thing work?

37:43.220 --> 37:45.620
This thing reads like stereo instructions! Is this on?

37:45.620 --> 37:51.900
What the hell? Orange Lounge Radio. Broke-down ghetto Bimani

37:51.900 --> 37:58.860
radio. What the ****? Yes, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. By the way, the beep

37:58.860 --> 38:06.860

Lounge. Join in the chat room, go to our website at orangelounges.skie.cx and join our chat

38:18.980 --> 38:25.980
room. Pizza's been here. That's getting added to the list, man! Didn't you see everybody

38:28.100 --> 38:34.500
eating pizza in front of you? Blind much? Jamie's sitting here going, nah, nah, I love

38:34.500 --> 38:41.500
pizza. Strisa's got pizza sitting in his freaking hand. Is the pizza here yet? Oh my god. I

38:42.340 --> 38:47.100
thought they were supposed to deliver the pizza five minutes ago. Poor Loki. They did.

38:47.100 --> 38:50.100
What are we paying this guy for?

38:50.100 --> 38:52.100
We're not.

38:52.100 --> 38:56.100
He gives good handjumps. No, I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. God, I'm kidding.

38:56.100 --> 38:59.100
Oh, somebody said the S word.

39:08.100 --> 39:11.100
All right, all right. Talk about the FUs of the week, please.

39:11.100 --> 39:13.100
Pretty please, Jamie. Tell us all about it.

39:13.100 --> 39:15.100
Fuck a duck screw a kangaroo.

39:15.100 --> 39:21.100
It's going to be one of those shows. It is one of those shows.

39:21.100 --> 39:26.100
I don't know.

39:26.100 --> 39:32.100
The five cases a week are when we get pissy and say, fuck you.

39:32.100 --> 39:38.100
See, Rob likes to censor and go, F, not me. I don't care about watching my fucking language.

39:38.100 --> 39:41.100
So, fuck.

39:41.100 --> 39:47.100
Okay, if the two minutes off my life thing were true for everything, I would be burning in hell right now.

39:47.100 --> 39:51.100
But remember, I have to take over hell.

39:51.100 --> 39:52.100
Ah, yes.

39:52.100 --> 39:54.100
Alright, so we're ready to do these FUs of the Week.

39:54.100 --> 39:55.100
My kunitori of hell.

39:55.100 --> 39:57.100
Did you say your kuditori of hell?

39:57.100 --> 39:59.100
People who watched Udoni Kenshin would get it.

39:59.100 --> 40:00.100
Oh, okay.

40:00.100 --> 40:06.100
Alright, here we go, the FUs of the Week, starting off with the FU goddess that we always start off with.

40:06.100 --> 40:08.100
Fuck, say it, Rob. Say it.

40:08.100 --> 40:15.100
It's the FUCK SHIT COCK HORSE PISS CUNT USED OF THE WEEK.

40:15.580 --> 40:20.140
My first fuck you of the week goes to my shoes.

40:20.140 --> 40:23.700
People who have seen me know about my burning feet.

40:23.700 --> 40:26.180
I have the coolest pair of shoes in the universe. You might want to see a doctor about that.

40:26.180 --> 40:29.660
Bite my ass.

40:29.660 --> 40:32.900
I bought these shoes two and a half months ago from the Vans Outlet.

40:32.900 --> 40:36.380
And the last pair of shoes I got from the Vans Outlet lasted me a year and a half.

40:36.380 --> 40:40.540
These are starting to really kill my feet. Before I got my pair of shoes before these,

40:40.540 --> 40:44.020
I was having really bad problems with the arches and the old shoes.

40:44.020 --> 40:48.980
I couldn't play DDR without having my arches hurt and having my feet just be really painful.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.180
Well, these shoes

40:50.180 --> 40:55.380
are starting to do it to me, and I've only had two and a half months that I've been wearing them.

40:55.380 --> 40:58.080
So, fuck my burning feet.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.780
They might like it.

40:59.780 --> 41:02.460
Shut up, Rob.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.020
Next thing.

41:04.020 --> 41:07.060
but starting off went back to my career

41:07.060 --> 41:11.200
because they have this and now on top of the on top of the machine

41:11.200 --> 41:13.400
and cancer nice and good anything

41:13.400 --> 41:16.080
if it's not going to your eyes when you're trying to play a song for the

41:16.080 --> 41:17.120
first time

41:17.120 --> 41:18.380
absolutely

41:18.380 --> 41:21.660
welcome all of the couple

41:21.660 --> 41:23.300
family and a couple family

41:23.300 --> 41:26.940
i think the mob on songs that the god damn mobile song

41:26.940 --> 41:29.400
luckily

41:29.400 --> 41:32.260
anyway

41:32.260 --> 41:35.980
this is the way it was going like doesn't matter if those like tearing up

41:35.980 --> 41:37.780
the whole time so i think you play

41:37.780 --> 41:39.980
but i think we're hurting questions

41:39.980 --> 41:41.660
and then i think it was an issue

41:41.660 --> 41:42.940
appealing up so they like

41:42.940 --> 41:47.180
runs into the ball of my feet and the ball

41:47.180 --> 41:49.540
and then

41:49.540 --> 41:53.420
but i think that's because i have to be lucky for all of my clothes

41:53.420 --> 41:55.340
because all of them acting

41:55.340 --> 41:57.540
i think my room

41:57.540 --> 41:59.780
he got about twenty hours

41:59.780 --> 42:01.820
i think my room

42:01.820 --> 42:04.260
I have done two loads of wash.

42:04.260 --> 42:07.160
I have about maybe ten more to go.

42:07.160 --> 42:11.380
I didn't realize my wardrobe was so huge.

42:11.380 --> 42:14.060
The other thing, fuck my new pair of jeans.

42:14.060 --> 42:20.220
Because they were falsely made and now I can't return them because I've already worn them.

42:20.220 --> 42:22.060
In the rain. Fuck the rain.

42:22.060 --> 42:25.660
Because it's not.

42:25.660 --> 42:28.200
And fuck your Yankee blue jeans.

42:28.200 --> 42:29.660
Bravo. Thank you.

42:29.660 --> 42:32.620
that it

42:32.620 --> 42:36.580
moving on to look is if i have to ask i don't know as if i have to ask what is

42:36.580 --> 42:39.260
that the other week is a terrible okie

42:39.260 --> 42:42.780
well start off with the most recent thank you for not telling me there's

42:42.780 --> 42:43.860
pizza here

42:43.860 --> 42:47.420
how much is the observant when there's so much shit going on

42:47.420 --> 42:48.580
i'm hungry

42:48.580 --> 42:50.100
i'm seeing i'll

42:50.100 --> 42:54.620
i mean strippers

42:54.620 --> 42:55.940
anyway

42:55.940 --> 42:59.620
I thought you said that your list of priorities put food above strippers.

42:59.620 --> 43:00.720
It did.

43:00.720 --> 43:06.500
Well, my food's almost gone, see?

43:06.500 --> 43:10.940
There's a really huge F.U., and that goes to drivers, again.

43:10.940 --> 43:12.700
Akine.

43:12.700 --> 43:14.340
I'm gonna kill you.

43:14.340 --> 43:16.260
You freaking get near me!

43:16.260 --> 43:17.460
Seriously!

43:17.460 --> 43:21.940
Stop trying to cut me off! If you're skipping to the old Asian bitch, stop changing lanes!

43:21.940 --> 43:23.740
For no apparent reason!

43:23.740 --> 43:26.120
I don't give a shit if you don't know where you're going!

43:26.120 --> 43:27.720
Don't get in my way!

43:27.720 --> 43:33.000
F you to stupid driver's ed people! You're driving 40 miles under the speed limit

43:33.000 --> 43:37.040
and you piss me off! I don't care if you know how to drive because you're never going to learn how to drive

43:37.040 --> 43:38.680
C point A!

43:38.680 --> 43:40.540
Okay?

43:40.540 --> 43:42.160
Also!

43:42.160 --> 43:44.080
F you to freaking golf lands!

43:44.080 --> 43:45.000
They suck ass!

43:45.000 --> 43:49.000
Okay, stocking golf lands alright but their carpet sucks shit.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.280
roseville golf land

43:50.280 --> 43:54.040
well you kind of have to have drumsticks play drum mania

43:54.040 --> 43:57.480
that's kind of the point of the game

43:57.480 --> 44:01.360
bang the sticks against the drums that's how it works

44:01.360 --> 44:04.600
uh... although they'll go down in here

44:04.600 --> 44:08.000
they have created

44:08.000 --> 44:09.920
if you hear extreme

44:09.920 --> 44:12.180
for one reason

44:12.180 --> 44:15.080
michael but they've been

44:15.080 --> 44:19.480
NO ONE SHOULD PUT A RICKY MARTIN COVER IN ANY FUCKING DDR MIX!

44:19.480 --> 44:21.680
That's it, for now.

44:21.680 --> 44:25.720
It works for somebody, amigo.

44:25.720 --> 44:28.980
Oh fuck that!

44:28.980 --> 44:32.360
Matt has a mouth full of anyway, going back to...

44:32.360 --> 44:35.240
Jamie, Jamie's had a relapse. Yes.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.200
Back to the Golf Land thing.

44:37.200 --> 44:43.520
Fuck those idiots last night, I had your asses kicked out and that was cool.

44:43.520 --> 44:45.000
Alright, uh, my turn.

44:45.000 --> 44:45.500
Are you sure?

44:45.500 --> 44:46.000
Yes.

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
My FU of the Week. I would additionally like to give an FU of the Week to drivers.

44:50.000 --> 44:50.500
Yeah, fuck you.

44:50.500 --> 44:59.000
If you were driving on I-5 North about last Sunday night, about, oh, I don't know, anytime between noon and nine, because that's how long we were on the goddamn road.

44:59.000 --> 45:06.000
If you were driving on that road, fuck you. I hate you. Burn in hell for all eternity because you don't know how to fucking drive.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
Loki had enough road rage for the both of us, at least.

45:10.000 --> 45:14.120
I was driving it. He was yelling at everything. It helped pass the time. What can you say?

45:15.120 --> 45:18.240
My other F.U. goes to work. I don't want to go back tomorrow. Fuck work.

45:19.920 --> 45:22.000
What other F.U.s do I have? I guess that's it.

45:23.760 --> 45:29.000
That's it. That's all the F.U.s I can think of for right now. So fuck, fuck Stockton Golf Line for being ghetto.

45:29.000 --> 45:34.280
Oh, fuck people that don't know how to follow a token line. Fuck the token line. Just fuck the token line all together.

45:34.280 --> 45:38.680
I can't fucking stand the token line because nobody ever knows how to follow the token line because

45:38.680 --> 45:41.880
Nobody is smart that plays DDR, apparently.

45:41.880 --> 45:45.980
Listen crazy bitch, you don't fucking put 12 tokens on the goddamn line!

45:45.980 --> 45:47.980
One at a time, you dumbass!

45:47.980 --> 45:49.980
I'm gonna be playing a lot!

45:49.980 --> 45:52.980
Fuck that bitch who puts 12 tokens on the machine and says,

45:52.980 --> 45:54.980
you say, you're only supposed to put one up.

45:54.980 --> 45:56.980
Oh, I'm gonna be playing a lot.

45:56.980 --> 45:57.980
Fuck you!

45:57.980 --> 46:00.980
You're gonna be playing none at all when I have my foot so far up your fucking ass

46:00.980 --> 46:02.980
you won't be able to walk straight for a week.

46:02.980 --> 46:08.980
No, you showed the pit so far up her ass that she tastes rubber.

46:08.980 --> 46:14.980
Anyway, um, yeah, so fuck the token line.

46:14.980 --> 46:15.980
Good thing I didn't see her.

46:15.980 --> 46:20.980
Because nobody knows how to follow it. Try a sign-up sheet. It takes a pen and a piece of paper.

46:20.980 --> 46:25.980
And, um, and again, if you steal a pen, you're fucking sad.

46:25.980 --> 46:30.980
If you have to steal a goddamn fifty cent thick pen, your life is really fucking sad.

46:30.980 --> 46:32.980
I hope you die. I hope you die of syphilis.

46:32.980 --> 46:36.980
And F you to that stupid flamboyant retard who is playing Para Para.

46:36.980 --> 46:38.980
I understand that Para Para is a game for women,

46:38.980 --> 46:40.980
but fucking, seriously, you're way too-

46:40.980 --> 46:44.980
Oh, yes! And F you to people who play Bimani games that look gayer than me.

46:44.980 --> 46:46.980
Nobody is gayer than me! Nobody!

46:48.980 --> 46:50.980
That was just- it was just so weird.

46:53.980 --> 46:57.980
It- it- it's just- but this guy was more flamboyant than...

46:57.980 --> 46:58.980
Oh my god.

46:58.980 --> 47:04.980
Liberace! This guy was more flamboyant than fucking Elton John!

47:04.980 --> 47:09.980
He must have been the most flamboyant person on the known...

47:09.980 --> 47:11.980
He scares me! Scares me!

47:11.980 --> 47:13.980
I have video of it, though. It will be going up on my website.

47:13.980 --> 47:18.980
Yeah, we're going to be making flamingpara.com

47:18.980 --> 47:20.980
I'm done.

47:20.980 --> 47:22.980
I got really ranty this week. That was amazing.

47:22.980 --> 47:25.980
Jamie, I see why Jamie likes this.

47:25.980 --> 47:27.280

47:34.460 --> 47:38.340

47:38.340 --> 47:42.300

47:46.500 --> 47:47.700

47:54.700 --> 47:55.700
Alright.

47:55.700 --> 47:56.700
My music again, please.

47:56.700 --> 47:57.700
Okay.

47:57.700 --> 48:05.700
Fuck my Trueno in Initial D. I love the car to death, but it has no acceleration, so I

48:05.700 --> 48:06.700
made a new car.

48:06.700 --> 48:09.700
I have an Integra Type R now and it's named as Magic.

48:09.700 --> 48:10.700
That's all.

48:10.700 --> 48:11.700
Okay, I have another ramp.

48:11.700 --> 48:12.700
Oh, God.

48:12.700 --> 48:15.060
With the exception of Jamie, fuck Initial D players.

48:15.060 --> 48:16.900
You all drive the same goddamn car.

48:16.900 --> 48:21.340
I saw seven of you coming out of the Golf Lamb parking lot, all with cheap-ass plastic

48:21.340 --> 48:22.780
spoilers on your little rice rockets.

48:22.780 --> 48:23.780
No, no, no, no.

48:23.780 --> 48:24.780
The erector set spoilers.

48:24.780 --> 48:26.100
Yes, the erector set spoilers.

48:26.100 --> 48:27.780
God, you people are sad.

48:27.780 --> 48:31.220
Initial D is not real life.

48:31.220 --> 48:34.260
Remember folks, you're driving a Civic, not a race car.

48:34.260 --> 48:35.260
God.

48:35.260 --> 48:37.260
Stickers, do not make it go faster.

48:37.260 --> 48:46.180
Ooh, I put the Type R sticker on my, my, uh, Toyota, um, excuse me, there's no, any, no

48:46.180 --> 48:47.180
Toyota car.

48:47.180 --> 48:48.980
Your car is sad, and so are you.

48:48.980 --> 48:50.660
You can't drift on Highway 80.

48:50.660 --> 48:51.660
Get over it.

48:51.660 --> 49:00.040
Oh, that doesn't stop me from getting my actual Corolla, 86 Corolla hatchback to modify into

49:00.040 --> 49:03.040
the Torino Sprinter with me on the paint, because, uh...

49:03.040 --> 49:04.040
No, I'm just kidding.

49:04.040 --> 49:05.040
But Jamie's cool like that.

49:05.040 --> 49:06.040
She's okay.

49:06.040 --> 49:07.040
She's the exception to the roll.

49:07.040 --> 49:10.940
I think the whole reason I would have a Ricey car is because I think they're funny.

49:10.940 --> 49:12.860
Jamie can appreciate the comic value of a funny car.

49:12.860 --> 49:13.860
I think they're funny.

49:13.860 --> 49:19.260
I want to get, like, an 85 Mustang GT and, and, and, like, Rice's...

49:19.260 --> 49:27.640

50:31.820 --> 50:38.820
First of all, F.U. is a butterfly upswing mix. I pick it by accident, then I accidentally

50:45.060 --> 50:52.060
put it on maniac. What the hell? I wasn't in the mood for a cata. I got four cata's

50:52.300 --> 50:59.300
on my belt. I accidentally put on a cata. Auto fail within, I don't know, 30 seconds.

50:59.300 --> 51:01.800

51:01.800 --> 51:04.940

51:04.940 --> 51:08.940

51:27.300 --> 51:28.300
p0k3smot42o0

51:28.300 --> 51:32.300
Oh, you made me forget what I was going to say!

51:32.300 --> 51:34.300
Angel, you got any FUs of the Week?

51:34.300 --> 51:36.300
I had one, but he took it.

51:36.300 --> 51:37.300
You want me to go with somebody else and come back?

51:37.300 --> 51:38.300
Yeah, sure.

51:38.300 --> 51:40.300
Alright, Stressa, give me your FUs of the Week.

51:40.300 --> 51:43.300
Wow, interesting list for me today.

51:43.300 --> 51:46.300
Which kind of goes against the usual.

51:46.300 --> 51:50.300
First and foremost, the parents still need a serious...

51:50.300 --> 51:56.300
Well, I'll let you fill it in however you like, okay?

51:56.300 --> 52:06.300
My mom is still pissing me off to no end. My dad, well, he still needs a lesson in pulling his head out of his ass, but that's a side issue.

52:06.300 --> 52:18.300
I want to send out an F.U. to my ex. She's been totally pissing me off lately. She sent me this Dear John-like email and hasn't said a word to me since.

52:18.300 --> 52:29.540
well what the hell next on the list what life and the general ideals that some

52:29.540 --> 52:40.700

52:40.700 --> 52:45.700
You know what? Big steel dildo for you. Right up the ass.

52:46.700 --> 52:50.700
Got that. That's the impression he and I didn't want to think of.

52:50.700 --> 52:52.700
Anyways, I think I'm about done.

53:00.700 --> 53:03.700
All right. Allergies must die.

53:03.700 --> 53:06.700
We ready for Angel? Did you remember?

53:06.700 --> 53:13.700
Alright, go to Loki, because he thought of another one.

53:13.700 --> 53:17.700
Um, this is just a really short one, unlike the other ones.

53:17.700 --> 53:22.700
F you to the Ralphs that we went to last night, because they were out of three important things.

53:22.700 --> 53:24.700
One, large boxes of Bagel Bites.

53:24.700 --> 53:26.700
Two, Maxim Magazine.

53:26.700 --> 53:28.700
And three, PSM.

53:28.700 --> 53:32.700
All the things I wanted from the Ralphs that they didn't have, so F you to the Ralphs.

53:32.700 --> 53:33.700
That's it.

53:33.700 --> 53:41.540
In favor of the Ralph's they have some money they have some money and chocolate whipped cream. Yes, ready with chocolate ready with chocolate with it

53:42.260 --> 53:46.540
All right, I'm gonna run through the chat room FUs. We'll come back to angels. She thinks they're hers. Okay

53:47.940 --> 53:49.540
On with the chat room FUs

53:49.540 --> 53:53.440
It's really a F you to having to come home on my birthday and missing orange lounge that day

53:53.820 --> 53:56.380
well, that's okay because we do rebroadcast every Monday night and

53:56.900 --> 54:00.540
Supposedly that I heard a rumor we do them on Thursday afternoons to when it actually works

54:00.540 --> 54:04.740
But it hasn't for like the past month, so it's always been like 15 minutes late or some shit

54:04.740 --> 54:10.540
So Thursdays at 2 we try to do them, but Mondays at 7 it always happens, so you can always catch up on orange limes that way

54:11.460 --> 54:16.160
Black web fuck power outages one messed up on my clocks last night fuck my video card

54:16.160 --> 54:17.900

54:17.900 --> 54:22.340
But the shittiest frame rates Loki you better keep your mouth shut on that fuck the timing about my car

54:22.340 --> 54:26.460
It needs to be replaced and will cost near $800 that kept me from rearing my car up to Davis this quarter

54:26.460 --> 54:32.460
Oh yeah, and fuck the city of Davis, too. Fuck the owner of TapX that refuses, and it got cut off.

54:32.460 --> 54:36.460
Silly Mac. I'm guessing he refuses to turn up Macs or something like that.

54:36.460 --> 54:40.460
And, uh, yeah, he's reminding me I need to make an announcement, which I will do.

54:40.460 --> 54:43.460
And, um...

54:43.460 --> 54:45.460

55:17.820 --> 55:19.820
See if there's a push pin over on Brian's desk.

55:19.820 --> 55:22.820

55:35.820 --> 55:38.820
I don't count it when people say slut in the chat room.

55:38.820 --> 55:51.020
I just spent an awesome 27 hours with my best friend Owen, and also fuck school tomorrow

55:51.020 --> 55:55.180

57:47.800 --> 57:51.800
Tried to kill you with Pepper? How is that possible?

57:51.800 --> 57:55.800
She was making sandwiches, and I was bending down to get the tomatoes out of the cooler, and

57:55.800 --> 57:59.800

57:59.800 --> 58:03.800

58:34.460 --> 58:35.420
Alright.

58:35.420 --> 58:42.220
Those are the lovely FUs of the week. They suck because they broke Speed Demon and wouldn't fix it, those bastards.

58:42.220 --> 58:46.420
Everything else is broken there, why not? Slinky says FU to people who jam seven quarters

58:46.420 --> 58:49.620
and break the coin slot for Max 2. That does suck.

58:49.620 --> 58:53.340
That's like the girl putting in her twelve tokens all at once.

58:53.340 --> 58:56.300
They go stupid.

58:56.300 --> 59:01.760

59:01.760 --> 59:02.760
vacation time.

59:02.760 --> 59:04.180
I don't have to go to school.

59:04.180 --> 59:10.920
I don't have to go to school either. Ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

59:10.920 --> 59:12.920
I have to go to work though.

59:12.920 --> 59:15.120
At least I'm not one of those corporate whore types.

59:15.120 --> 59:18.380
Hey, I can surf the internet at work.

59:18.380 --> 59:19.380
Me too. He he.

59:19.380 --> 59:25.520
Hey, I download 500 megs worth of sim files every day, so ha. Oh, I got a late one. I

59:25.520 --> 59:28.520
I got a late one. It's from a new person in our chat room, so say hello to the new person.

59:28.520 --> 59:29.520
It better come late than never.

59:30.520 --> 59:34.520
This new person was asking about DDR in Auburn, by the way. Where the hell is there a machine up there, Brad?

59:34.520 --> 59:35.520
Second mix.

59:35.520 --> 59:40.520
Okay, they used to have a third mix at the, uh, some Pizza Express. It's not there, I hear.

59:40.520 --> 59:43.520
But there is a second mix. Probably the only one in all of California.

59:43.520 --> 59:44.520
I wanna play!

59:44.520 --> 59:50.520
It's in the, um, signature theaters, and the volume is all the way down. So try playing BeatMania with no sound. It's pretty fun.

59:50.520 --> 59:51.660
fun.

59:51.660 --> 59:54.920
Anyway, Tadpole says, I want to say, fuck you, to my grandma, for making me turn the

59:54.920 --> 59:58.900
volume down solo. I can't hardly hear anything. Fuck you to Pizza Express for not having DDR

59:58.900 --> 01:00:03.420
anymore. And a great big fuck you to gas stations for gas being so damn expensive. Ooh, even

01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:03.420
that?

01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:04.980
Yeah.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:04.980
Fuck gas.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:11.980
So I don't try.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:15.620
Oh.

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:16.340
Treadrag. Treadrag.

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:20.220
i guess that that one about uh... the seven points in the max two is actually

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.080
from when they somehow missed it because uh...

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:24.140
he doesn't count

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:25.540
i don't know

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:27.740
no i had it on the

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:30.420
c i thought this thing was for both of those of us

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:33.060
whatever anyway who cares

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:35.380
moving on

01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:37.960
that's all of our if he's the way those beautiful wasn't

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.860
are we going to another

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:40.560
we want to talk

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:41.460
talk more about

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:45.060
titty our orders let's talk to our our guests that we don't have here on the

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:50.060
show very much. Like, ever. Let's talk to Stress on DDR Angel.

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:57.060
Ugh, Loki. I just want to make a comment. I like that fort. That fort was cool.

01:00:57.060 --> 01:01:04.060
Yes, yes. I live up in the boondocks, up in northern...well, I'm out there. If you know

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:09.980
where Santa Rosa is, you're likely to find me there. The fort is cool. I wish I could

01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:13.340
take a trip out there. The fort is damn sexy.

01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:16.840
We don't know if people live there, because we do see smoke every occasionally, but nobody

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.400
ever really checks it out.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.200
Go figure.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:24.120
Could it be those big graffiti signs that say, keep out of the fort?

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.120
Very well possible.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:31.440
Of course, you know, we should still make that image for Jamie, the Jamie New World

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.240
Order, beginning in the fort.

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:37.240
Let's start my own cult, we'll move into a compound.

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.240
Woot.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:47.200
Well, it actually might be considered a dark black forest, but of course Jamie will have

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:52.040
the interesting opportunity to meet said forest.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:58.080
Be the army of Stoics, and I will have a dark black forest because I don't particularly

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.320
care for that song.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:09.640
overplayed but I want I want my own compound where I can make people I want

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:13.520
to recruit stupid people in this compound and then make them die face

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:19.400
first in the pool of jello I say we all quit our jobs and move into the fort yes

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:24.640
we must move into the fort orange lounge live from the fort next week all right

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:28.600
so there's the fort how are you doing angel we haven't heard much from you

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:39.600
Why did you start playing DDR? What got you into DDR? Was it the flashing seizure lights or the music?

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:40.600
The truth or other?

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:45.600
Other. We never tell the truth in the show.

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:46.600
I don't know.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:50.600
Alright, so most of us don't know why we play DDR.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.600
I got conned into it.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.600
You got conned into it. Good answer.

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:58.600
And then I couldn't stop. And I still haven't stopped.

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.600
It's an STD all of its own.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:04.600
It's an STD all of its own.

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.600
Is DDR a disease? Maybe it is.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:09.600
It's an addiction.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.600
It's an addiction and I need help.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.600
Unfortunately, they don't have a 12-step program for this yet.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.600
And they're not going to, because whoever tries to start one, I'll kill.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:23.600
It's an addiction like crack, cocaine, and alcohol, and then Longerburger baskets and things like that.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.600
It's an addiction that's good for you.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.600
Vanilla crack. Vanilla crack!

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.600
Propel.

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:33.600
Hi, my name is the 23rd Magus and I'm a Romani addict.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.600
Get me a gun.

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.600
Isn't this the point where we're supposed to clap or do something?

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.600
Isn't the point where someone's supposed to go,

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.600
Hi, Magus!

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.600
Hi, Magus!

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:46.600
There we go!

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.600
Gee, I'm feeling better now.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:51.600
You know what? I think that it's really...

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:59.040
The Space Aliens came and invented the Bimani series, no, it was Tran's race.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:06.600
This is the great space Kog'Al Tran came on her flying saucer with her cat and her snowmobile

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.720
and decided to make us all Bimani addicts.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.600
Ooh, the snowblower of doom.

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.040
You haven't seen the video, watch the video for some reason.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:15.440
This is DDR, not the last Starfighter.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.840
It is like that, see, they're going to make us into an incredible race of rhythm-dancing

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:24.840
And at the last war, at the end of the world, we're all going to have to dance off against the aliens.

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:27.840
That would work, except for one thing. We're not Asian.

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:29.840
Oh, exactly.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.840
But I am.

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.840
Yeah, exactly. See, we kill any deaths to the kneecaps.

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:42.840
Hey, I may be honky with no reason, but there are some Asians here who can help.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:47.840
I don't know. If you count maybe about 150 years back, I could qualify.

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:57.840
Late fuck you to pizza for being so damn yummy and good that I eat it all and I get fat in my arteries and I die.

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:58.840
Ugh!

01:04:58.840 --> 01:04:59.840
Yay, Dad!

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.840
Propelico! Ugh!

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:08.840
Yeah, anyways, as far as the beginning of my Bomani DDR-type addiction, it was because of Angel!

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:14.840
It was she who conned me into it, and ever since, I don't quite know what's become of me.

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:18.840
Yes, but you have gone from one step to five, all in one day!

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.840
Have a murder cookie!

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.840
They're death-orific!

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:24.840
Yes, cookie! Death cookie!

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.840
I'm really scared.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:30.840
For the people who aren't seeing these, we have holiday Oreos.

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.840
They can't call them Christmas Oreos because it's not politically correct.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:36.840
So they're holiday Oreos, with red filling.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.840
And they're red, like they're stained with blood.

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.840
Like a tampon.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:45.840
Now they're menstrual cookies!

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:49.840
We'll call it mensios.

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:53.840
That's disgusting.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:57.840
It tastes like a cycle.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:01.840
I feel bad because I forgot to check the mailbag for the FUs of the week.

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:05.840
There was one sitting in there so I've got to do it.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:09.840
You can't always send an email though if you want.

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:13.880
You want to hear more? How about the tax on you wouldn't let me play for anyone else, okay? All right? Oh?

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:17.840
Wait he requested a song for ZF you should I give it to him?

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:22.120
No, I never let people have their requested songs so deal

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:27.360
All right, I'll be nice because only because we forgot okay

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.240
Muhaimer

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:36.200
Muhaimer says yay for drunk parents and their friends making drunk eat the snowman outside my house on New Year's Eve by

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.600
Decorating him with beer noisemakers in the hat

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.600
That is the winner!

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.600
That is the best FU I think I've ever read on this show.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.600
Look at the eventually drunk squirrels running around.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.600
That was worth going back to the FU segment for right there.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.600
Drunky the snowman.

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.600
I want to make one.

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.600
Now featured on DTRPC.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:04.600

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.600

01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:15.540
Bait man, bait man, take me away and let's fly into a milky way

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:22.540
Bateman, Bateman, waiting for you, and then fly away to the moon.

01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:28.540
Bateman, Bateman, Bateman, Bateman.

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:32.540
The following bit of randomness has been brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:34.540
Dateline, the Muppet Show.

01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:38.540
It has been reported just moments ago that a large, heavy object was dropped from the ceiling.

01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:40.540
Further developments will...

01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:41.540
Hey, any balls down there?

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:44.540
About the biggest bird you've ever seen, Diggleberry!

01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:12.540
talk about. I don't have anything to do with it.

01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:16.540
Uh, do I have to do everything? Oh yeah, let's hear a sim update before we get to list list.

01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:18.540
And we'll do a list list. Let's do a sim update.

01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:23.740
Uh, sim update. Finally, we can stop playing DDRPC if you haven't done it yet because they

01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:28.540
released the last stupid character set. Not that anyone even fucking cares anymore because

01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:33.500
I don't. The game sucks ass. But if you care, it's some stupid princess and some prince

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:39.460
guy, and I don't care, it's crap. Whatever. Enjoy. So, they're there for your enjoyment.

01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:45.460
Um, aside from that, Turning Mix 3 is wrapping up. Tomorrow should have the results, um, they're...

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:53.460
I'd have to say this has been the worst run tournament I've ever seen, and they should all burn in hell for it, and I'm gonna do better for it.

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:57.460
I'm gonna do a better tournament than they will, because I own them!

01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:00.460
Speaking of which, how did Make Edit Get Porn go?

01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:06.460
Well, you know what? Some people just don't understand this concept of deadlines.

01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:12.460
So you know what? The people sent me edits to get porn. The people didn't. Go fuck themselves!

01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:15.460
You should give me porn anyway.

01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:21.460
I know, I have plenty of porn to give away. I mean, people don't like porn in my work for some reason. I don't know why.

01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:24.460
They just put it in the coffee room and I take it.

01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:26.460
I think that porn is funny.

01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:29.460
But, yeah. Porn blows. Get it?

01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:31.460
How's that?

01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:33.500
But yeah, so that's what's going on.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.260
As I mentioned slightly earlier, there's going to be a

01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:39.420
Leech from Loki 2.0s coming up, because I got web hosting

01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:43.300
thanks to DDR Alama from DDR Mania X and Chris Stanford

01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:44.460
from the Step Mania site.

01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:46.700
They're giving me web hosting with unlimited space and

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:49.260
limited bandwidth, so I get to put whatever the fuck I want

01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:50.020
on there.

01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:52.180
I guess they're trying to challenge me to crash the

01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:54.060
boards or something, but whatever.

01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:56.540
So I'm going to put all my SIM files on there slowly in

01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:57.140
theme packs.

01:18:57.140 --> 01:18:59.860
We're going to do interviews with step file makers and that

01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:00.340
kind of thing.

01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:11.340
So, that's pretty much what's coming up. Right now I'm just redoing the design of the site because I have to try to figure out how the fuck to sort 2100 step files. So, that'll be fun.

01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:24.340
Aside from that, do check out bmonistyle. They're putting up all week long the new DDR Extreme DWIs. In fact, they're the thing for the Legend of Max and Paranoid Survivor samples.

01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:30.980
So, definitely check them out if you haven't yet for Sim Files and that kind of thing.

01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:34.220
Really aside from that, not too much going on other than, you know, DDR Extreme coming

01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:39.000
out and, you know, us finding out more about it, but looks like we pretty much, you know,

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.900
we know what songs are going to be hidden in there.

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:45.580
And I have a continued little rant, sort of.

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:48.500
Basically this is a fuck you to everyone that said I was wrong about Sakura being in fucking

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:53.660
DDR Extreme because I knew I called it a long ass time ago and all of you naysayers can

01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:58.740
burn in hell

01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:02.000
so that's all

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.220
okay i i went back to over the mailbag to uh... look at some

01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:10.220
back to see if we've got

01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:12.620
you do

01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:17.100
i would see if we got an email and guess what we do we have a question

01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:19.820
from uh... so cal kicks of course

01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:23.820
It's a question specifically for Loki.

01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:27.820
Can I have the Robotech Macross Saga DVDs?

01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:32.380
Well, if I had them to give, then yeah.

01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:34.720
But I don't, so no.

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:35.720
Can I have some more porn?

01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:38.660
I have titles I like.

01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:43.020
All I get is the stupid Playboy shit, and so, you know, I pretty much gave you all the,

01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:44.420
well, some of the new stuff.

01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:45.420
I guess, yeah.

01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:48.140
You know, whatever I have.

01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:51.500
He says at the end, PayPal may come if two or more of the requests are met.

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:56.860
I don't know how two or more is possible, because you only made two requests!

01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:57.860
You're being edumacated, apparently.

01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:02.480
You know what, if he actually came up here to visit us instead, he could come to my house

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:05.980
and not only watch all the Robotech stuff, but watch all the Macross stuff, because I

01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:09.300
happen to have the whole box set.

01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:12.940
And Final Fuck X, which I got a copy of last night.

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:16.140
Your HP tastes good!

01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:17.140
Did it turn out alright?

01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:21.140
Yeah, it was cool. It's just VCD quality, whatever, you know.

01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:25.140
It's the same as the other VCDs I have from Japan. They're porn, they're censored.

01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:29.140
Censored porn sucks. It's like made-for-TV porn.

01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:33.140
Alright, I'm opening up another email here.

01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:36.140
Dark Tetsuya wants to know, when will you put more of an SMA into rotation?

01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:39.140
I do have a request for one song. I want to hear Red Hot. It's really cool.

01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:41.140
Yeah, all of mine's on MP3s are porn.

01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:43.140
All of, oh wow.

01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:44.140
Whoa!

01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:46.140
Was that like that letter bit?

01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:51.700
All of my MP3s, by the way, because I've had all the Vanessa May stuff, they're gone, because

01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:52.700
guess what?

01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:57.100
My hard drive broke, so you send me red hot, it'll make it into rotation.

01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:58.820
All right, we'll get red hot into rotation.

01:21:58.820 --> 01:21:59.820
I need a noose!

01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:01.860
Damn you, you Vanessa May damn whore, all right.

01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:03.660
Jamie made a noose.

01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:06.500
She has a noose on her neck, and I have a noose on my neck.

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:07.500
This is weird.

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:08.500
Okay.

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:09.500
Moving on.

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:14.500
Hey, dual mic penetration.

01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:17.900
i want my news back

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:19.140
okay

01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:20.560
uh...

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:23.980
let's talk about some show news things that have happened in the past uh...

01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:25.700
coming in the future the show

01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:27.700
uh... voters

01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:29.700
you said coming

01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:31.180
you slide

01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:38.180
i'm sorry to know what did you say that you're a slight

01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:42.180
I love you all night long if you let me sing for you

01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:10.180
From the outside coming in...

01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:12.180
Your eyes still work. Your eyes still work.

01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:13.180
This is...

01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:14.180
You made me watch Showgirls.

01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:16.180
I did make her watch Showgirls.

01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:17.180
That's a good movie.

01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:18.180
That's a good movie.

01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:20.180
For me to poop on!

01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:24.180
I never actually thought it would be something like this.

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:26.180
But, when you enter this...

01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:28.180
Whoa! Hello!

01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:30.180
I just got a little show there.

01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:32.180
When did the studio turn into a gay nightclub? Stop that!

01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:37.180
He almost gave me a lap dance.

01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:41.180
The weird part about it is, I was still standing.

01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:44.180
News!

01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:47.180
Why don't you sit on this?

01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:52.180
And now he's been tied.

01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:54.180
I'm sorry, you had a thought?

01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:57.180
No, no, it was coming into this from the outside.

01:23:57.180 --> 01:23:59.180
Yeah, I said it again.

01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:01.180
Look who's the dirty slut now!

01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:05.180
Maybe coming to be our worst nightmare.

01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:17.180
Hi, I have news. I wanted to get to Orange Lounge News because this is actually really

01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:23.700
big news. We've made our first bestest friends on the interweb and those buddies of ours

01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:32.540
I saw your tummy. I'm blind. Our new bestest friends on the interweb are located at east

01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:36.580
eastofosaka.net

01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:41.580
and jamie had to do a lot of that to get this to happen, no I'm kidding, I'm kidding

01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:43.380
37? In a what?

01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:45.540
Trying not to suck any dick out of the parking lot

01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:48.460
Hey, you get back here

01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:52.800
all right uh... yes eastofosaka.net, they're our friends, our bestest friends on the net

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:57.180
and uh... they've led us onto their forums so if you thought the orange lounge forums

01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:58.740
sucked on uh... the little

01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:00.660
free thing we had then fine

01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:04.760
We've got cool forums now because they're a part of the East of Osaka.net forums, so

01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:08.820
my avatar owns all of you.

01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:12.540
I still think mine's cooler because I actually spent a long time working on it.

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:18.000
Of course, it's the same one I use on DDR Freak and on Step Squad board, and I would

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.980
use it on Sack of Imani, but we can't have them.

01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:25.700
We have one thing to say.

01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:29.020
You don't love us!

01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:30.540
What the hell was that for?

01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:31.540
We love you!

01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:32.540
Yay!

01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:34.540
You guys all ran away.

01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:41.620
Cause you said you loved them and then you didn't say us and we visited you.

01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:42.840
I love everybody.

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.580
Listen you guys, I'm a huge slut, okay?

01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:45.580
I love everybody.

01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:46.580
I love you!

01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:53.580
I'm getting a lap dance, three of them, all at once.

01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:55.500
I'm gonna go hide in the corner.

01:25:55.500 --> 01:26:01.060
Anyway, the link to the new boards are being posted in the chatroom now, or if you are

01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:06.020
too lazy to follow the links in the chatroom, just go to our site, orangelounge.skie.cx,

01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:07.500
click on forums, and it takes you to the new forums.

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:10.300
And if you don't, we'll kick your ass.

01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:11.940
You'll lose our love.

01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:12.940
And the forum crew.

01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:17.340
I don't want to lose your love tonight.

01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:18.840
Okay.

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:21.780
So definitely check out the new forums.

01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:28.340
And next week, next Saturday, is a pretty nifty tournament going on in Fremont.

01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:33.400
And I think this is the first time, besides Shaft, that all three hosts will be attending

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:34.400
a tournament together.

01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:35.400
All three of us.

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:36.400
Am I correct?

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.400
One of them might be competing.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.400
Yeah.

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:39.400
Oh, you're going to compete?

01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:40.400
I'm at GPA.

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:41.400
Oh, very cool.

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:42.400
You're not going to compete, Logie.

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:43.400
Okay, we'll go cheer Jamie on.

01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:45.300
I may or may not do PA.

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:47.860
We're all going to be going to Fremont to check out the tournament there.

01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:48.860
It's at some pizza place.

01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:51.740
I don't remember the details because I'm lazy, but DCV's in the chat room.

01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:53.740
How does it matter? They have pizza there.

01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:54.740
That's all that matters.

01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:58.740
DCB can post a link for all of you to go visit if you want to come to the tournament.

01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:00.740
We'll be there doing interviews and stuff.

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:03.740
And DCB wants you to pre-reg.

01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:09.740
If I have the money to a man, I'm getting keyboard mania tomorrow, so my money's kind of tight.

01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:10.740
Alright.

01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:11.740
I'll bring the bat though.

01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:13.740
Oh, we need to get new bats to have everyone sign.

01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:14.740
Okay, that's a good idea. We'll go get new bats.

01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:19.740
I've got to go buy a new orange bat because everyone signed them at the Mountain Mike's tourney, so I have to buy a new bat.

01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:20.740
Yeah.

01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:23.920
Alright, there's the link to the page right there.

01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:26.840
Rabbeats.com slash tilde killer pals slash Fremont2.html.

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:31.940
You'll never remember that so just click the link in the chatroom.

01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:32.940
Internet.

01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:36.480
The interweb!

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:40.740
You're showing us pictures of, oh it's the ghetto DDR extreme 8th mix sign from Stockton

01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:41.740
Golf Land.

01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:42.740
Nice.

01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:43.740
Very nice.

01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:46.980
Speaking of which, we got to check out the nice ghetto max 2 that they're giving away

01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:48.020
in the cyber returning.

01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:49.020
Oh my lord.

01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:52.020
I hope they clean it up. I hope they clean it up a little.

01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:54.020
I'm looking forward to that tourney a lot.

01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:57.020
It's a machine, but there's not much of a machine.

01:27:57.020 --> 01:28:00.020
We've got another question in our inbox.

01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:02.020
I want to answer it.

01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:05.020
Do you like big cock?

01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:07.020
It's a rude question. I don't think you'll want to answer that one.

01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:10.020
I do, because no one else loves the cock.

01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:13.020
We'll have a real guest.

01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:15.020
Wait! That's the question!

01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:19.020
They want to send that they want no one orange light no style and wants to know when the orange line was gonna have a real

01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:21.020
guest

01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:28.100
Fuck you no style. I will show my at my hey

01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:31.700
Board starts coming over here. I'm all for it. Okay

01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:36.340
Hey, you know, I think somebody just want to have their name right on the radio. Well

01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:41.900
You had something you wanna say Jimmy are you gonna you're not gonna go jump off a bridge with that thing around the neck

01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:43.900
Are you big cock?

01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:47.900
Is that going to be our special guest, or big black cock?

01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:51.900
Alright, tonight's special guest, my cock. Say hello.

01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:55.900
Is your cock black?

01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:59.900
I can get a sharpie.

01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:03.900
Rob's going to have like little arrows tattooed.

01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:07.900
Just dip it in hot fudge or something.

01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:11.900
That is a big brown cock. A very hot cock.

01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:17.660
I don't know if I like this show reverting to discussions about my cock, but in a way it's kind of cool

01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:20.340
You brought it up my friend

01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:22.980
And I'm bringing it up right now

01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:26.540
It got all over me

01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:33.980
And Rob was delivered a sharpie

01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:37.980
Put it away! Put it on! Put it on!

01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:41.980
What do you do to keep that thing in your pants?

01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:45.980
I pander my dick.

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:49.980
Is there a difference?

01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:53.980
I'd like to see a freestyle routine where somebody just whips their cock out at the end.

01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:57.980
What song would that be good to?

01:29:57.980 --> 01:30:01.980
Blow My Whistle.

01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:06.980
No, we need to do a freestyle routine where we throw dildos into the crowd.

01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:09.980
Or those penis-shaped chocolates.

01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:15.980
That'll be on paranoia or something. You can just flip your cock out and...

01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:21.980
When is somebody going to do a routine where they whip their cock out at the end? Come on.

01:30:21.980 --> 01:30:26.980
I'm surprised all you comedians out there like to play DDR. Nobody's done it yet. Come on.

01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:32.980
Some women play DDR2, let's see some tits. Let's see a topless DDR routine, come on.

01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:39.980
Wait, they have to be good looking. We must make sure there's no food around either.

01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:46.980
It's bad enough, those female freestylers who think that they have a good routine just by grabbing their boobs.

01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:49.980
You know, that sucks. That's not good freestyle.

01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:51.980
What are you talking about, that's not good freestyle?

01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:56.980
It's not good freestyle. It's called stripping, not freestyle.

01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:59.980
It's good Maxim magazine, bad freestyle.

01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:01.980
It's called maybe slut style.

01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:08.980
Hey, I had a check mark on all of my judging little forms there. Grab boobs then, okay?

01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:13.980
I had to make a provision when doing the rules for shaft, no boob grabbing.

01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:18.980
Because that doesn't make a good routine.

01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:22.980
Okay, that's getting into one of my pet peeves of DDR freestyling.

01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:23.980
Ooh, let's hear it.

01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:25.980
Don't grab your boobs!

01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:26.980
What if I...

01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:27.980
I'm sorry.

01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:28.980
What if I grab my boobs?

01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:29.980
Is that okay?

01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:30.980
Okay, wait, wait.

01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:32.980
What if Alan Rickman got on stage and started whipping out his cock?

01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:34.980
Okay, first of all, he wouldn't.

01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:35.980
Okay.

01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:36.980
But you know what?

01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:42.980
I don't see the male freestylers grabbing their dick or anything while they're freestyling.

01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:46.980
I will enter a routine and I will grab my dick during the routine.

01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:48.980
I'll make you happy if I do my suggestion.

01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:50.980
I wonder why you suggest it?

01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:52.980
I'm using it as an example, okay?

01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:53.980
Oh, okay.

01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:55.980
You know I'm a crazy bastard, I'll do it.

01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:58.980
I can't freestyle, so at least I'll get a laugh when I grab my dick, you know?

01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:00.980
Hey, it's a whole new meaning to PA.

01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:02.980
Penis attack.

01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:04.980
Awesome.

01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:07.980
Hey, Evan.

01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:12.980
Every day with Rob is a penis attack.

01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:14.980
I figured out how to make one.

01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:17.980
Oh great, we have a double-ended noose. How kinky.

01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:20.980
That's for the goth sex pervert, right?

01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:23.980
And it's black. Does it glow in the dark?

01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:26.980
You tell me it's yours.

01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:28.980
You gotta make it all flopsy.

01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:31.980
Get your own goddamn mic. Hold on a second, hold on a second. Here we go.

01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:33.980
Here's the stupidest thing to do on radio. Watch this.

01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:36.980
Okay, I'm going to use the mic and I'm going to make it funny.

01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:39.980
Are you ready? Okay, here's a gay man's...

01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:46.980
Here's a lesbian's nightmare.

01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:52.980
Here's a gay man's nightmare.

01:32:52.980 --> 01:32:53.980
There you go.

01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:55.980
Nobody in the audience.

01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:57.980
That was very intentional.

01:32:57.980 --> 01:33:00.980
Now, Rob, try to describe that.

01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:02.980
I had a question for you, Evan.

01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:08.980
Evan, why do you think nobody's whipped their cock out at the end of a DDR routine yet?

01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:13.980
Because we haven't seen the private DDR routines that Brad and Irene have.

01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:17.980
Late at night.

01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:22.980
And you know what, hold on a second, before Brad says anything, I do want to make this parting comment.

01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:27.980
Although I haven't seen it, I have heard that Irene's cock is quite nice.

01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:32.980
Oh boy.

01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:37.980
Yeah.

01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:44.740
We're going to take a quick break at this point because we've reached our cot quotient

01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:50.500
of the show and we're going to come back and we're going to play the match game live in

01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:51.500
studio.

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:53.300
We're going to do listless first?

01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:54.300
Yeah.

01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:55.660
Let's list the match game.

01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:56.660
We always do match game.

01:33:56.660 --> 01:33:57.900
We got to do the cage match some way too.

01:33:57.900 --> 01:33:58.900
Yeah, we have to do cage match.

01:33:58.900 --> 01:33:59.900
Let's do the cage match now.

01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:00.900
Okay.

01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:01.900
All right.

01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:02.900
Fuck the break.

01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:03.900
We'll do the cage match.

01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:04.900
All right.

01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:05.900
Here we go.

01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:06.900
Let them break.

01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:11.580
going to talk about last or two weeks ago we didn't do a cage match last week

01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:18.620
correct no no I didn't so last week two weeks ago in the orange lounge cage

01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:23.640
match where we pit songs against each other because we like to we had a Yumi

01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:28.620
Hamasaki win with connected in a very very very close vote I believe it came

01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:32.100
down to a game of rock-paper-scissors fuck all of you for not voting for

01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:35.900
Knight Rider bitches yeah Knight Rider was the shit but unfortunately it lost

01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:41.380
fuck me for being bad at rock, paper, scissors

01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:43.060
alright so uh...

01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:44.360
the first

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:48.180
the first time you're able to vote for one of three songs

01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:53.020
in the cage match, you can vote for last week's winner

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:53.940
i'm engrish today

01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:57.860
here's last week's winner, two weeks ago's winner, this is how Yumi Hamasaki

01:34:57.860 --> 01:35:24.060
with connected. Here's a little clip. Alright, that's the Yumi Hamasaki with connected. That's

01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:26.540
the first one you can vote for us last week's winner

01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:30.500
this first pick in the cage matches the group called bond

01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:34.720
with the song called way go to play out of this they have this for us

01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:36.700
it's short cool and way go

01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:39.980
all right here it is this first song in the cage matching before this week

01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:43.100
seconds i'm sorry you go for you and start hearing about this is bond with

01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:50.100
Fuego.

01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:47.100
I love that song. Anything with the name Fuego.

01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:50.100
Because I like fire.

01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:53.100
That was a pretty neat song. What did you all think of that?

01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:56.100
Let's go around the room. What did you think of it and judge it on a scale of 1 to 10?

01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:58.100
It's awesome 10.

01:38:58.100 --> 01:39:01.100
I think Fuego tastes pretty good, that soda.

01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:05.100
Oh, Fuego. That is a really cool song. Somebody should make steps for that for DDR.

01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:06.100
Loki?

01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:09.100
Don't look at me. I'm not going to friggin' make that.

01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:14.220
I give it an eight because it just sounds like Vanessa Mae.

01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:17.140
I'll do it. Seven. Good.

01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:20.100
Uh, personally I think that deserves an eight.

01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:23.420
I don't know. I'm also very partial to Fire.

01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:30.420
It does wonderful things for me.

01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:33.220
Angel says 9.5.

01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:34.460
She says I instead.

01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:38.980
Uh, I agree. It's Vanessa Mae the sequel, but it's still pretty cool, so I give it a nine.

01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:44.980
Alright, moving on, the next song. Loki, tell us about this one. Now we're only going to play part of this song, correct?

01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:46.980
Yeah, because it's like an eight minute long song.

01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:48.980
So we're going to play a few minutes of it, so tell us about this song.

01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:53.980
This song was entered in Turning Mix 3, the cut-down version of it was.

01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:59.980
This is an mp3.com artist, which should be going mainstream, I hope, soon.

01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:02.980
It's AirBass with their song Spin.

01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:07.140
And after this is over you can vote for this one if you want. This is airbase with spin

01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:34.980
Oh

01:45:32.980 --> 01:46:00.340
Alright, that was Air Bass for the song called Spin, that wasn't even the whole thing.

01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:02.340
So, that's the end of the Cade Smash.

01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:03.340
I meant for Hollick.

01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:04.340
Three songs.

01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:09.340
You have Yumi Hamasaki, last week's winner was Connected, Bond with Fuego, and Airbase

01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:10.340
with Spin.

01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:15.340
Uh, you guys can vote now, send your votes over a private message to Skye, and while

01:46:15.340 --> 01:46:17.340
you send your votes, let's hear the verdicts on Airbase.

01:46:17.340 --> 01:46:18.340
Drop.

01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:19.340
What?

01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:20.340
Drop.

01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:21.340
Yes.

01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:22.340
Hi.

01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:23.340
Hi.

01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:24.340
It was repetitive.

01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:25.340
He thought it was repetitive.

01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:26.340
Scale of one to ten.

01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:29.340
I would probably play that in the background while I'm working on banners and stuff and

01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:32.740
in my artwork, so I give it a seven and a half.

01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:33.740
Seven and a half, alright.

01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:37.740
It was just more dancey stuff.

01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:40.700
There's nothing wrong with dancey stuff, it's supposed to be long because it's a twelve

01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:43.140
inch mix, so you can mix it into other shit, but anyway.

01:46:43.140 --> 01:46:44.140
Twelve inches.

01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:45.140
Shut up!

01:46:45.140 --> 01:46:47.140
I can't even talk.

01:46:47.140 --> 01:46:53.740
Anyways, um, I like it, it was one of my favorite entries in Fraternity Mix 3, I wish I could

01:46:53.740 --> 01:47:00.740
have had a chance to cut it down so that it'd be less repetitive. But anyways, I'd give

01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:01.820
it a 10.

01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:04.900
Alright. Brad, what did you think of Airbase's spin?

01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:11.340
Cool, but they should have DDR sized, it would have been great. So, I'd give it a 7 as it

01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:12.180
is.

01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:17.340
Alright. Dave, what you heard of it? By the way, hi.

01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:27.340
Yeah, hi! I just kinda came in and took pictures, but I guess I was kind of listening, so I give it a seven and a half.

01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:28.340
You're full of shit.

01:47:28.340 --> 01:47:29.340
Magus!

01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:32.340
Blade ten, fear out.

01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:33.340
Stressa.

01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:38.340
Well, that was easily said. Um, I actually am quite fond of this track, I think.

01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:42.340
Wow, such spirit. Um, I'm gonna give that an eight.

01:47:43.340 --> 01:47:45.340
Uh oh, I'm tied.

01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:46.340
Angel, what do you think?

01:47:46.340 --> 01:47:53.340
you think? I said, um, time. Um, it's kind of a bullet thing. Uh, I'll give it an 8,

01:47:57.340 --> 01:48:03.020
sorry. Alright, an 8. Uh, I liked it, it was cool, except I didn't like that re-re-re

01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:08.020
part, and uh, Bond was better, so, uh, Fuego was better, so I can't rank it higher than

01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:13.340
that, so I'll give it an 8. Alright, so, the votes are coming in right now, we'll

01:48:13.340 --> 01:48:18.340
I need to send you all He-Man likes big butts.

01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:21.340
I'll find that file and send it to you later.

01:48:21.340 --> 01:48:27.340
So you can vote for Ayumi, you can vote for Bond with Fuego, or you can vote for Airbase.

01:48:27.340 --> 01:48:29.340
Rob's good at typing with one hand.

01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:30.340
I'm typing with one hand.

01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:32.340
I wonder how you got so good, Rob.

01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:35.340
Okay, so we'll tally those votes during the next segment.

01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:39.340

Sammy the snacker loves to eat and play DDR at the same time.

01:50:47.980 --> 01:50:51.460
When the arcade manager came over, he took one look at the pad and said,

01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:58.460
Damn it, Sammy! You got blank all over the dance pad!

01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:06.580
Sammy the snacker loves to eat and play DDR at the same time.

01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:09.380

01:51:09.380 --> 01:51:16.380
Damn it, Sammy! You got blank all over the dance pad!

01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:23.380

Damn it, Sammy, you got blank all over the dance pad.

01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:51.500

I would like to think that the manager said, Damn it, Sammy, you got animal cookie heads all over the dance pad.

01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:03.500
Cool!

01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:05.500

I'm sorry.

01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:06.520

01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:20.480
Okay.

01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:24.920
And I said, you know, because thinking that Sammy the snacker is going to be really excited

01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:29.240
to be playing DDR and eating at the same time, I said, Damn it, Sammy, you got jizz all over

01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:30.240
to the dance mat.

01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:33.520
Damn it, I was going to say that!

01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:35.600
We do not have a match.

01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:38.280
Which is half a match with Salty Nuts.

01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:39.280
Alright.

01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:40.280

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:49.280
It sort of went with pussy because I was thinking Sami might be a girl.

01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:50.280
Oh, very good.

01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:54.280
Or unless you know Sami just happened to be, you know, snacking away Rob.

01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:55.280
Yes.

01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:58.120
Irene would like to say Maddie's in the igloo.

01:54:58.120 --> 01:54:59.120

01:57:20.420 --> 01:57:23.420
All right, you've watched people play Para Para Escape.

01:57:23.420 --> 01:57:25.420
Yeah?

01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:27.420
I think it's something on the sidebar.

01:57:27.420 --> 01:57:29.420
Think dirty.

01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:32.420
Yeah, think dirty.

01:57:32.420 --> 01:57:35.420
Right, they're stroking themselves.

01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:37.420
Masturbating? You want to say masturbating?

01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:39.420
Your answer is masturbating, all right.

01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:42.900
favorite thing to do on the machine is to masturbate okay

01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:46.140
we have to use the masturbate i don't know if that's all that

01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:49.500
record i would hope that masturbating leads to another

01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:51.540
okay

01:57:51.540 --> 01:57:56.620
all right so excited he comes all over the screen i don't know

01:57:56.620 --> 01:57:58.180
all right while we go around

01:57:58.180 --> 01:58:01.780
while we go around and read the answers i think uh... it would be best to uh...

01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:04.340
the most appropriate for this question

01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:07.220
all right ralphie the ray of our loves to play part of our days more than

01:58:07.220 --> 01:58:10.420
His favorite thing to do on the machine is to...

01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:14.660
Drop E and hump the coin return.

01:58:14.660 --> 01:58:17.320
Bravo, but not a match.

01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:20.940
Lowkey, his favorite thing to do on the machine is to...

01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:28.660
Swing around his big black cock, close but not a match.

01:58:28.660 --> 01:58:33.420
If it was stroke, that would have been a match.

01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:06.620
Almost, but not a match.

01:59:06.620 --> 01:59:07.620
My answer...

01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:08.620
Get a Korean Booty.

01:59:08.620 --> 01:59:11.700
Ralphie the Rayvar loves to play Para Para Vardice more than anything in the world.

01:59:11.700 --> 01:59:17.060
His favorite thing to do on the machine is to rip out his cock.

01:59:17.060 --> 01:59:18.320
I don't know, judges.

01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:21.140
Why is cock in such a big font?

01:59:21.140 --> 01:59:22.140
Because I like cock.

01:59:22.140 --> 01:59:25.940
I think because there was so much mention of cock that was matched up with each of them

01:59:25.940 --> 01:59:26.940
to get a half point.

01:59:26.940 --> 01:59:27.940
Each of them gets a half point?

01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:28.940
Yeah.

01:59:28.940 --> 01:59:29.940
Alright, fair enough.

01:59:29.940 --> 01:59:30.940
Fair enough.

01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:31.940
Half a point each.

01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:32.940
Ow!

01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:36.500
we're doing it okay okay guests leave

01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:40.220
her we're doing a condensed version so just one more question

01:59:40.220 --> 01:59:43.300
all right one more

01:59:43.300 --> 01:59:46.580
one more question here we go

01:59:46.580 --> 01:59:50.060
out you go

01:59:50.060 --> 01:59:54.460
already out anyway

01:59:54.460 --> 01:59:59.140
last question area half a point each

01:59:59.140 --> 02:00:03.700
But here's the next question. Carrie the Camera Whore

02:00:03.700 --> 02:00:09.860
I don't have my music. Carrie the Camera Whore loves to take pictures at DDR tournaments

02:00:09.860 --> 02:00:13.020
but her collection of turdie pics is never complete

02:00:13.020 --> 02:00:20.020
without a picture of blank.

02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:24.660
It would be a female. She's a short little Asian girl with paragoons.

02:00:24.660 --> 02:00:28.660
Hey, what's up, Evan? How you doing?

02:00:28.660 --> 02:00:35.660
Carrie the Camera Whore loves to take pictures at DDR tournaments, but her collection of turny pics is never complete without a picture of blank.

02:00:35.660 --> 02:00:38.660
Yes?

02:00:38.660 --> 02:00:41.660
What? I didn't finish what I can do.

02:00:41.660 --> 02:00:45.660
He just handed me the mic. My God! The pressure! The pressure!

02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:48.660
Okay, this is Carrie the Camera Whore?

02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:49.660
Yes.

02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:52.660
Carrie the Camera Whore! Yes, we all know Carrie, don't we?

02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:56.660
That person who either likes to chat with everybody and take all the pictures and keep them for herself,

02:00:56.660 --> 02:01:00.660
or says that she's going to upload them to the website any day now?

02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:03.660
Oh, I'll upload them tomorrow. I just got them scanned.

02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:05.660
Everybody's writing?

02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:07.660
Everybody's writing?

02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:11.660
Yeah, everybody knows what you're putting. However, you have to actually write it down.

02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:14.660
Did you write it down?

02:01:14.660 --> 02:01:16.660
In's the rules.

02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:19.660
Who's actually matching?

02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:21.660
Oh.

02:01:23.660 --> 02:01:24.660
Yeah, sure.

02:01:24.660 --> 02:01:26.660
Rob's cock.

02:01:26.660 --> 02:01:28.660
Without a picture of Rob's cock!

02:01:28.660 --> 02:01:29.660
Yes, ladies and gentlemen?

02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:30.660
All right.

02:01:30.660 --> 02:01:35.660
You need one of those little tiny microscopic lenses.

02:01:35.660 --> 02:01:36.660
Ha.

02:01:36.660 --> 02:01:37.660
Get the victims.

02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:39.660
All right, here come the victims.

02:01:39.660 --> 02:01:43.660
It's Ra- I am Ravery.

02:01:43.660 --> 02:01:44.660
Carry the camera, whore.

02:01:44.660 --> 02:01:47.660
Oh, sorry, I don't want to read it before they get here.

02:01:47.660 --> 02:01:48.660
Hello, wait.

02:01:48.660 --> 02:01:53.660
Okay, here they come. Here they come. Here I come.

02:01:53.660 --> 02:01:58.660
Alright, here's your question. Stressa, you're first up.

02:01:58.660 --> 02:02:03.660
Stressa, Carrie the Camera Whore loves to take pictures at DER tournaments,

02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:08.660
but her collection of turning picks is never complete without a picture of...

02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:09.660
Upskirt shots.

02:02:09.660 --> 02:02:12.660
Upskirt shots! Very nice.

02:02:12.660 --> 02:02:14.660
Carrie's a lesbian, apparently. Alright.

02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:16.660
Carry the camera, horror angel.

02:02:16.660 --> 02:02:17.660
Loves...

02:02:17.660 --> 02:02:21.660
If you like panty shots, you must go out and get the anime.

02:02:21.660 --> 02:02:23.660
Uh, what is it? It's, uh, VR, uh, the, the...

02:02:23.660 --> 02:02:25.660
Night Saver? No, it's, uh...

02:02:25.660 --> 02:02:26.660
Night Saver?

02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:27.660
Go Kaiser?

02:02:27.660 --> 02:02:29.660
No, no, no, no, no. VR 40 fresh! VR 40 fresh!

02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:33.660
You must get VR 40 fresh, because every other shot is a panty shot.

02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:34.660
Upskirt.

02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:37.660
You know, it's amazing how many times I have to crawl through tunnels in that.

02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:42.660
How dare you? You made me forget the question.

02:02:42.660 --> 02:02:44.660
Well, I'll read it to you again.

02:02:44.660 --> 02:02:48.660
Carrie the camera whore loves to take pictures at DDR tournaments,

02:02:48.660 --> 02:02:52.660
but her collection of tourney pics is never complete without a picture of...

02:02:52.660 --> 02:02:55.660
I have to say upskirt shots. I'm sorry.

02:02:55.660 --> 02:02:57.660
Upskirt shots. They're both saying upskirt shots.

02:02:57.660 --> 02:03:02.660
Does genitalia count as an upskirt shot? Because, like, I'm close.

02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:08.660
Why? Because you made me think that way, and that's the first thing I thought of.

02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:10.660
Sure it was. Okay, here we go.

02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:14.660
And Rob, I'm sure you've worn a skirt before.

02:03:14.660 --> 02:03:17.660
Hi, what's up?

02:03:17.660 --> 02:03:18.660
Get out!

02:03:18.660 --> 02:03:21.660
Alright, here we go.

02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:23.660
Starting with Jamie.

02:03:23.660 --> 02:03:26.660
Jamie, that camera...

02:03:26.660 --> 02:03:30.660
Actually, she's always on the cover of National Geographic.

02:03:30.660 --> 02:03:34.660
She's the one washing her clothes in the river.

02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:37.660
You know, topless.

02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:39.660
I'd like to give my answer.

02:04:07.660 --> 02:04:12.660
I'm going to have to modify what, it's pretty much what my answer was going to be.

02:04:12.660 --> 02:04:17.660
Instead of her big black cock, it's going to be her big black cock.

02:04:17.660 --> 02:04:20.660
Her big black cock. Sorry, not a match.

02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:24.660
Dave, her collection of tourney pics is never complete without a picture of...

02:04:24.660 --> 02:04:27.660
Two girls humping the secret rendezvous.

02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:32.660
Two girls humping the secret rendezvous. Beautiful.

02:04:32.660 --> 02:04:35.660
But not a match.

02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:39.660
Thank God that didn't go out on air. Unless you want a mic to say that again.

02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:43.660
Thank God I wasn't given mental imagery of...

02:04:43.660 --> 02:04:47.660
Okay, it happens.

02:04:47.660 --> 02:04:51.660
Brad, her collection of tourney pics was

02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:55.660
never complete without a picture of Fiona showing off her ass.

02:04:55.660 --> 02:04:59.660
Thank you, Brad, for saying everything

02:04:59.660 --> 02:05:03.660
we were saying. Her collection of tourney pics was never complete

02:05:03.660 --> 02:05:09.180
without a picture of Fiona showing off her ass. Good answer, however, it's not a match.

02:05:09.180 --> 02:05:13.620
My answer, did I get everybody else? No. Oh, I'm sorry, Magus. Oh, he's hiding behind me.

02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:17.420
I had to kind of go... Well, how's that match? Because the first time I saw Fiona, she was

02:05:17.420 --> 02:05:21.620
showing her ass off through her skirt. Oh, okay. Then that's a point. Yay, they get a

02:05:21.620 --> 02:05:27.300
point each. All right. All right. I had to go... I have a point and a half each. I had

02:05:27.300 --> 02:05:31.500

Don't say the same thing. That's not how you break a tie.

02:09:35.340 --> 02:09:39.340
What did you call me?

02:09:39.340 --> 02:09:41.340
Skinny white cunt!

02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:43.340
I thought so.

02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:48.340
Oh!

02:09:48.340 --> 02:09:50.340
Wait, Fiona's not white.

02:09:52.340 --> 02:09:55.340
Oh, was that my outer monologue? I thought that was my inner voice.

02:09:55.340 --> 02:09:57.340
Is this white, or pink?

02:09:57.340 --> 02:09:59.340
This whole weekend?

02:09:59.340 --> 02:10:07.340
Wait, wait, excuse me! Nobody saw this, but I just got hit by the door three times! My ass got hit by the door three times, thank you!

02:10:07.340 --> 02:10:08.340
Okay, quick question.

02:10:08.340 --> 02:10:09.340
After you go through the door.

02:10:09.340 --> 02:10:11.340
Quick, quick question.

02:10:11.340 --> 02:10:16.340
Female Asians with big breasts, man-made or myth?

02:10:16.340 --> 02:10:17.340
Next time, Jerry, bring it.

02:10:17.340 --> 02:10:20.340
I think we should go on to our next answer.

02:10:20.340 --> 02:10:24.340
Oh yeah, mine was dead babies, because nobody probably heard that.

02:10:24.340 --> 02:10:25.340
Or we forgot, I don't know.

02:10:25.340 --> 02:10:28.340
I had to go for the obligatory. Propel!

02:10:28.340 --> 02:10:29.340
Yes!

02:10:29.340 --> 02:10:37.060
No, you are up by one point, so if I said Propel, we go to another tiebreaker round.

02:10:37.060 --> 02:10:40.820
If I said Big Black Cock, Angel's going to win by a lead.

02:10:40.820 --> 02:10:42.220
Angel gets a Big Black Cock.

02:10:42.220 --> 02:10:50.420
My answer was, on Orange Lounge, we talk about Ted DDR.

02:10:50.420 --> 02:10:51.660
Angel wins!

02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:54.580
Angel, go get a handful of Jamie's Big Nuts.

02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:57.060
That's your prize.

02:10:57.060 --> 02:10:58.060
Just get your hand in there.

02:10:58.060 --> 02:11:02.660
justice all yes to them all up now with them put it in your mouth

02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:07.340
it

02:11:07.340 --> 02:11:09.620
you know you want to suck it all come on

02:11:09.620 --> 02:11:12.020
michael gogo

02:11:12.020 --> 02:11:16.460
all she's getting

02:11:16.460 --> 02:11:20.180
you hot for her to handle

02:11:20.180 --> 02:11:22.840
he's got a mouthful enough

02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:24.040
All right, that's it.

02:11:24.040 --> 02:11:26.240
And once again, my nuts are safe for consumption.

02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:29.200
We're going to go.

02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:34.040
And with that, I think that we have a very appropriate song

02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:35.640
here to be playing.

02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:38.280
It's going to be called Cramming for College.

02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:43.920
So do enjoy.

02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:44.600
All right, enjoy.

02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:47.240
This is our next break music, because Loki wants to hear it.

02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:48.720
This is called Cramming for College.

02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:49.320
Yes?

02:11:49.320 --> 02:11:50.200
Public announcement.

02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:52.280
I think I just pissed myself.

02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:53.540
Okay.

02:11:53.540 --> 02:11:56.160
You smell funny.

02:11:56.160 --> 02:11:58.040
I'm so scared I sold my armor.

02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:01.760
All right. I hope you enjoyed the match game. We'll be right back. If you want to send us an email,

02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:05.400
OrangeLawnTradioYahoo.com, if you have more questions for us. In the meantime, we have to tabulate the votes.

02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:08.720
In the meantime, we've got to tabulate the votes. We'll do that during this break for the cage

02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:11.800
match, and we will be right back.

02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:16.200
Okay, class. Our final exam will be coming up at the end of this week. Our final exam will be in

02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:18.160
big black cocks. The test will be comprised of

02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:19.440
twenty percent written,

02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:20.900
thirty percent oral,

02:12:20.900 --> 02:12:24.880
and fifty percent anal. Any questions?

02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:26.000
Professor?

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:27.200
Yes, dear?

02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:30.080
Will there be any extra credit?

02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:32.080
I am so glad you asked.

02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:02.080
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:02.080
I

02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:07.080
I'm the king of the game world We said that I can't do

02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:14.080
Do you believe in love? Yes, I'm the king of the game world

02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:21.080
I'm the king of the game world Do you believe in love?

02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:23.080
If you believe in love

02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:26.240
Yes, I'm so big in love

02:16:27.580 --> 02:16:29.580
I'm not your man anymore

02:16:29.940 --> 02:16:31.940
Oh, yes, I'm your power

02:16:31.940 --> 02:16:32.940
Da da da

02:16:32.940 --> 02:16:34.880
Ooh-ooh-ooh

02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:36.880
Da da da

02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:39.880
Don't you think you can't go on?

02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:43.280
If you believe in love

02:16:43.280 --> 02:17:06.280
You're standing there with your arms unfolded like a eucalyptus care

02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:12.280
Even before you glanced at me, I already felt the chemistry

02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:17.280
Don't know what it is about you that's got me feelin' right

02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:24.280
I each, I once, let you get away, boy, you're a lucky one

02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:30.280
I don't need you, cause the truth is, got my hands full of fatties

02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:37.280
But I want you, gonna put you at the very, very top of my head

02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:42.280
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:46.280
You are all I care

02:17:46.280 --> 02:17:50.280
I want that, that

02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:02.280
I don't need you

02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:04.280
Cause the truth is

02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:06.280
Got my hands full of love that it is

02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:12.280
But I want you, gonna put you at the very, very top of my lip

02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:19.280
Yeah, I want you, gonna have you, and that's the way it is

02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:49.280
Okay, we'll do this. We'll do Paranoid Survivor from the new DDR Extreme, and then we'll come back and we've got a list list for you guys.

02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:38.280
Orange Lounge Radio, will you put your thing down, flip it and reverse it?

02:20:38.280 --> 02:20:43.480
back, Orange Lounge Radio, and everybody is furiously working on their list, because we

02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:49.680
are going to do a list list. But first, I want to announce the winner of the cage match,

02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:55.840
very close by the way, this song won, the other two were tied, and this song had one

02:20:55.840 --> 02:21:00.560
vote more than the other two, so it was very close, the winner of this week's cage match

02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:02.640
once again, Ayumi Hamasaki with Connected.

02:21:02.640 --> 02:21:14.240
How you doing over there, Jamie?

02:21:14.240 --> 02:21:15.640
I'm ready to do the listless.

02:21:15.640 --> 02:21:19.120
You're having that sad, sad spinster look on your face.

02:21:19.120 --> 02:21:24.760
It's because my number three song, I'm trying to imagine, my number three choice, I'm trying

02:21:24.760 --> 02:21:27.400
to imagine what it would be like, because we haven't even announced our listless yet,

02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:28.400
what it's going to be.

02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:29.400
Why don't you tell them?

02:21:29.400 --> 02:21:37.000
Well, we're doing one for top song in any other Bimani game that you would like to see in 2DX.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:41.320
Usually we do it, you know, what we want in DDR, well screw DDR, we want 2DX.

02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:47.840
Right, and with Extreme you had a bunch of other Bimani songs crossing into DDR, so Jamie thinks we ought to do it the other way around, put them in 2DX.

02:21:47.840 --> 02:21:50.920
In fact, I'm actually erasing my number 3 because I'm going to put in something from another game.

02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:57.880
Alright, so if that's the case, then I think we usually, I'll start, I don't use the start, we'll go around, we'll do Jamie last, we'll go around this way.

02:21:57.880 --> 02:21:59.600
Oh fine, thank you.

02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:01.920
I'm saving the best for last year.

02:22:01.920 --> 02:22:03.280
Okay, so I'll start.

02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:09.440
My number three on this list of songs from another Bomani game that ought to be in 2DX

02:22:09.440 --> 02:22:10.440
that aren't...

02:22:10.440 --> 02:22:12.880
Fireball!

02:22:12.880 --> 02:22:15.400
I think that song would be funny in 2DX.

02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:17.280
I could kind of imagine how it would go.

02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:21.200
You know, you can only get so much of the trance and Eurobeat stuff.

02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:23.280
I'd like to see something a little funky in 2DX.

02:22:23.280 --> 02:22:27.440
So Fireball's my number three pick for what ought to be in 2DX from another Bomani game.

02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:32.440
Let's go over to Angel. Your number three choice is... Oh, you only have two so far?

02:22:32.440 --> 02:22:39.440
Actually, yes, that song is on it. Angel's got to think of another one? Okay.

02:22:39.440 --> 02:22:46.440
You had one? All right. Number three choice.

02:22:46.440 --> 02:22:48.440
Uh, Tokyo Already.

02:22:48.440 --> 02:22:50.440
Tokyo Already. That's a pretty good one.

02:22:50.440 --> 02:22:54.440
It's Eurobeat, and Eurobeat's getting big in 2DX.

02:22:54.440 --> 02:22:58.680
Tokyo Already, pretty cool song from Dance Maniacs, right?

02:22:58.680 --> 02:23:01.480
All right, Monkey Dance is already in 2DX, dummy.

02:23:01.480 --> 02:23:05.280
Stressa, your number three pick.

02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:08.040
OK, I know it might sound a little hokey,

02:23:08.040 --> 02:23:11.680
but the idea of having Like A Virgin

02:23:11.680 --> 02:23:12.920
might be kind of interesting.

02:23:12.920 --> 02:23:16.680
Like A Virgin from Parapara.

02:23:16.680 --> 02:23:20.280
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, I'd want it just for that part.

02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:21.960
That'd be pretty cool.

02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:24.000
Mm-hmm.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Did you already go, Jamie?

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
We're going around this way.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:31.000
My number three, badly, is Superstar.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Superstar!

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
I knew you were going to think about that one.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Superstar. Loki.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:43.000
This is one of my favorite Dance Maniacs tracks. It's Mind Parasite.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:47.000
Mind Parasite, interesting choice.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
From Dance Maniacs. Jamie, you're number three.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
You said you were going... I was going to ask.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:52.000
Yeah, you are.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:57.000
I pick On the Jazz.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:58.000
On the Jazz?

02:23:58.000 --> 02:23:59.000
Interesting one.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:00.000
Why On the Jazz?

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Just because it would be fun to play all the sax line in it.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:07.800
I mean, you think about how San Malete went with all the horn parts.

02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:08.800
Yeah?

02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:09.800
Interesting choice.

02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:10.800
I wouldn't have guessed.

02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:12.040
I didn't even think you liked that song.

02:24:12.040 --> 02:24:13.040
I do.

02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:14.040
I'm kind of surprised you put it.

02:24:14.040 --> 02:24:15.040
Okay, cool.

02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:16.040
Well, that's cool.

02:24:16.040 --> 02:24:17.040
Good for you, Jamie.

02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:18.040
All right.

02:24:18.040 --> 02:24:19.040
Number two picks.

02:24:19.040 --> 02:24:41.040
I'm going to get Hell from Jamie, but I chose Dark Black Forest as my second choice.

02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:43.040
Black Forest.

02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:46.400
I don't hate the song, it's just overplayed.

02:24:46.400 --> 02:24:48.040
I would have to agree with that.

02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:50.760
Dark Black Forest should be in 2DX.

02:24:50.760 --> 02:24:51.600
Stress out.

02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:54.000
My second choice, why?

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.240
Because I love the beats.

02:24:56.240 --> 02:24:57.400
Boom Boom Dollar.

02:24:57.400 --> 02:24:59.360
Boom Boom Dollar.

02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:02.480
Oh my god, Boom Boom Dollar in 2DX.

02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:03.920
I'm completely sad and pathetic.

02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:05.880
Would be fucking hilarious.

02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:06.680
Have mercy.

02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:08.880
Gee, I thought it was going to be Bumblebee.

02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:10.200
That would be fucking funny.

02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:14.200
I'm sorry. I give it a point for comic value. Brad!

02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:16.200
What? What?

02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:18.200
Nothing. Dave was just making a joke.

02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:21.200
He said that he was going to burn his PS2 to the ground if that was on.

02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:27.200
Then I'd be like, yes, and then I'd take the ashes and let it rise like a phoenix back into a PS2 and then I'd play it.

02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:29.200
Brad, you're number two big.

02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:32.200
Well, thanks for the comedy killer.

02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:38.200
My number two big is Ecstasy, because that song kicks ass and owns you all.

02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:41.320
It'd be like having insertion.

02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:42.320
Ecstasy.

02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:43.320
Loki.

02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:47.800
Well, it's only fitting since, you know, if we're talking about a new mix of 2DX, it would

02:25:47.800 --> 02:25:52.640
obviously be with the new mix of DDR, so why not the Legend of Max?

02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:54.640
Legend of Max.

02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:55.880
My fingers would fall off.

02:25:55.880 --> 02:25:57.880
My turn, my turn, my turn.

02:25:57.880 --> 02:25:58.880
It feels like burning.

02:25:58.880 --> 02:25:59.880
Jamie, you're number two.

02:25:59.880 --> 02:26:01.660
It feels like burning heat.

02:26:01.660 --> 02:26:02.880
My baby mama.

02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:04.120
My baby mama.

02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:05.120
Yes.

02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:08.120
I'm thinking about playing the bass line with that.

02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:38.240
That's fine. We can have a dupe. That's fine.

02:26:38.240 --> 02:26:40.580
Angel.

02:26:40.580 --> 02:26:43.640
Okay, this is my personal favorite at the moment.

02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:45.320
I chose Eurobeat.

02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:47.300
Eurobeat, go!

02:26:47.300 --> 02:26:51.780
Well, 6 style had a lot of pair of songs in it, so Eurobeat would definitely fit in.

02:26:51.780 --> 02:26:53.060
So Eurobeat.

02:26:53.060 --> 02:26:55.240
Angel's number one choice.

02:26:55.240 --> 02:26:58.800
Well, since we talked about... Oh, I'm being told that

02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:01.600
Gamlande Couples in Beatmania the final.

02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:03.240
Can somebody give me...

02:27:03.240 --> 02:27:09.100
oh yeah that's our talk about two d x not be made not five t two d x haha

02:27:09.100 --> 02:27:10.100
that's right thank you

02:27:10.100 --> 02:27:12.880
i didn't know that that's still pretty cool if it's in uh...

02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:16.480
even in the final but that's not to the x

02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:18.440
my first

02:27:18.440 --> 02:27:20.640
since we talked about

02:27:20.640 --> 02:27:22.480
let's talk about some pretty

02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:25.760
beginning it is into the exercise

02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:27.600
what's all that

02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:31.080
yes sucks to be me

02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:34.360
Let me think some more.

02:27:34.360 --> 02:27:35.820
All right, we'll come back to Starza.

02:27:35.820 --> 02:27:36.320
Oops.

02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:37.160
He's not doing it.

02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:38.080
I forgot.

02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:39.360
I'll stick to my game face.

02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:42.320
OK, my number one and the best song in the world,

02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:44.320
the Miracle Moon remix by LED.

02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:46.760
Which was in BeatMania as well, but it needs to be in 2DX.

02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:49.080
It needs to be in 2DX with harder notes and stuff.

02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:50.800
That would be awesome.

02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:52.240
I would jizz in my panties.

02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:53.720
Oh, crap.

02:27:53.720 --> 02:27:58.720
I think I'm going to take my noose off now.

02:27:58.720 --> 02:28:07.720
Since Rob was a bastard and stole my number one, I'm going to just pick this really wig

02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:11.720
off one here.

02:28:11.720 --> 02:28:12.720
Kachaka.

02:28:12.720 --> 02:28:13.720
Kachaka.

02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:17.420
I almost picked that.

02:28:17.420 --> 02:28:21.500
I think I spelled Kachaka wrong, but whatever.

02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:28.500
My number one? Clunk Clunk. Clunk Clunk. Oh, good one. Good one from Keyboard Mania. That's

02:28:32.420 --> 02:28:37.700
a good pick. Did Stressa come up with one? How about Captain Jack? Captain Jack! Because

02:28:37.700 --> 02:28:41.700
no Bomani game is complete without Captain Jack. Beautiful. And if he wasn't there, he'd

02:28:41.700 --> 02:28:48.700
i

02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:55.960
okay so dang jamie read this list so far as it stands

02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:59.480
fireball Tokyo already like a virgin superstar my parasite

02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:02.720
on the jazz ghost dark black forest boom boom dollar

02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:06.900
as to see legend of max was it saying

02:29:06.900 --> 02:29:07.960
is misspelled

02:29:07.960 --> 02:29:10.480
because i did its twice it's the grammer check okay

02:29:10.480 --> 02:29:23.480
Legend of Max, My Baby Mama, Guacamole de Couple, Eurobeat, Miracle Moon LED Mix, Cachaca, Clone Clone 1655, and Captain Jack.

02:29:40.480 --> 02:29:45.240
elimination round where one song, sorry kids, it's gotta come off this list. This is a hard

02:29:45.240 --> 02:29:52.640
one. I guess I'll start. One song that's gotta come off this list for 2DX that I don't wanna

02:29:52.640 --> 02:30:02.640
see in 2DX. Boom Boom Dollar. That's forever and always a DDR song. I don't see it in 2DX,

02:30:02.640 --> 02:30:07.120
sorry. So I'm taking Boom Boom Dollar off the list. Angel, take one of these songs off

02:30:07.120 --> 02:30:18.120
The Guacamole List song.

02:30:18.120 --> 02:30:21.120
Oh, damn you, damn you!

02:30:21.120 --> 02:30:24.120
Why? Because I don't know it. My bad.

02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:26.120
We should play that during the break, man.

02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:28.120
You're a bad woman.

02:30:28.120 --> 02:30:30.120
Rob, I just heard the news.

02:30:30.120 --> 02:30:34.120
I heard that you have a bad case of balloon fight.

02:30:34.120 --> 02:30:38.120
I've heard that Pim can cure this, along with Sega.

02:30:38.120 --> 02:30:41.120
Sega!

02:30:41.120 --> 02:30:44.120
What are you doing here?

02:30:44.120 --> 02:30:47.120
Molesting you, apparently.

02:30:47.120 --> 02:30:49.120
Sonic!

02:30:49.120 --> 02:30:51.120
Okay, let's see here. Fireball took you already, like a virgin.

02:30:51.120 --> 02:30:53.120
Superstar mind parasite, I'm the jazz.

02:30:53.120 --> 02:30:56.120
Ghost, dark black forest, ecstasy, legend of Max.

02:30:56.120 --> 02:30:59.120
My baby mama, Eurobeat.

02:30:59.120 --> 02:31:01.120
Eurobeat?

02:31:01.120 --> 02:31:03.120
Miracle moon.

02:31:03.120 --> 02:31:05.120
What the hell is that?

02:31:05.120 --> 02:31:07.120
T'Chaka!

02:31:07.120 --> 02:31:11.120
Clung Clung 1655 and Captain Jack. Captain Jack.

02:31:11.120 --> 02:31:14.120
I'll tell you what, here we go. Just delete everything except Captain Jack.

02:31:14.120 --> 02:31:16.120
And it's all set.

02:31:16.120 --> 02:31:18.120
Yes, Captain Jack is loved.

02:31:18.120 --> 02:31:20.120
Alright.

02:31:20.120 --> 02:31:24.120
Moving along. Stressa, what comes off the list?

02:31:24.120 --> 02:31:29.120
I'm sorry, Angel, but Dark Black Forest must go.

02:31:29.120 --> 02:31:31.120
It's all good. I don't hate you.

02:31:31.120 --> 02:32:00.120
much. You'll get a beating later. I do. Jerk. Alright. Badly. I want to go last. Tough. I want a pony. Anyway. I don't want to piss anybody off because I'll take mine away. I'm going to have to go with Captain Jack. You bastard taking Captain Jack off the list. I hope you die. That's alright. Stressa. I'm just kidding. As payback for you taking

02:32:00.120 --> 02:32:07.120
For you taking off my song from the list, I still say you're a DIRTY KILLGIRL!

02:32:07.120 --> 02:32:17.120
Just because I'm not a huge fan of this song in both DDR and Beatmania, buh-bye Miracle

02:32:17.120 --> 02:32:18.120
Moon.

02:32:18.120 --> 02:32:23.120
You will rot in hell for this!

02:32:23.120 --> 02:32:24.120
Miracle Moon comes off the list.

02:32:24.120 --> 02:32:48.200
I think I'm going to have to go with taking off Eurobeat, just because as far as having

02:32:48.200 --> 02:32:51.200
Eurobeat song goes in 2DX, that wouldn't be much of a challenge.

02:32:51.200 --> 02:32:56.200
Alright, so... It doesn't have a lot of neat, synth-y stuff going on.

02:32:56.200 --> 02:33:01.200
So, we have the final list that our chat room now gets to vote on.

02:33:01.200 --> 02:33:03.200

Ghost, Estacy, Legend of Max, My Baby Mama, Kachaka, and CloneKling6035.

It turns out that we're so

02:37:10.580 --> 02:37:11.580
Rising

02:37:11.580 --> 02:37:13.980

So now when the air jumps

02:37:33.080 --> 02:37:35.580
Jumper jumpers grab my knees and stop now

02:37:35.580 --> 02:37:36.580
Feel like I'm your girl

02:37:36.580 --> 02:37:37.880
Enjoying the place you got

Summer la-la-la

02:37:42.380 --> 02:37:44.880
Can you hear my heartbeat?

02:37:44.880 --> 02:37:46.880
Summer la-la-la

02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:49.880
A rhythm that I repeat

02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:51.880
Summer la-la-la

02:37:51.880 --> 02:37:54.880
Can you hear my heartbeat?

02:37:54.880 --> 02:37:56.880
Summer la-la-la

02:37:56.880 --> 02:38:00.880
I know I'm in love with you

02:39:26.880 --> 02:39:30.480
But I like it, but I like it forever

02:39:56.880 --> 02:40:21.000
Bye bye baby balloon Bye bye baby balloon

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:35.180
Bitch, get a new song, an open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

02:40:35.180 --> 02:40:37.180
We are back and I'm having my picture taken.

02:40:37.180 --> 02:40:38.900
Oh, there, that was fun.

02:40:38.900 --> 02:40:39.900
All right.

02:40:39.900 --> 02:40:40.900
Whee!

02:40:40.900 --> 02:40:44.080
Hey, I got flashed by Angel, that was pretty cool.

02:40:44.080 --> 02:40:47.300
We have the results, ladies and gentlemen of The Listless.

02:40:47.300 --> 02:40:53.500
from any other Bamani game that ought to be in 2DX that isn't yet. And here it is, the

02:40:53.500 --> 02:40:57.820
number three choice, you voted Superstar!

02:40:57.820 --> 02:41:00.820
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

02:41:00.820 --> 02:41:02.820
No, Brad, can't you do the rap? Can you do the rap for us?

02:41:02.820 --> 02:41:08.100
Don't make me bust out my white honky rap skills on yellow ass.

02:41:08.100 --> 02:41:09.180
Come on, Emma Brad.

02:41:09.180 --> 02:41:11.860
I don't even remember how it goes.

02:41:11.860 --> 02:41:12.860
My name is Kaos, and I'm-

02:41:12.860 --> 02:41:13.860
No, wait.

02:41:13.860 --> 02:41:14.860
That's all I remember.

02:41:14.860 --> 02:41:15.860
I am here, and my name is Kaos.

02:41:15.860 --> 02:41:16.860
Whatever.

02:41:16.860 --> 02:41:22.140
This happens to me like VD is to Amadeus.

02:41:22.140 --> 02:41:24.540
Anyway, number two pick.

02:41:24.540 --> 02:41:25.300
You picked it.

02:41:25.300 --> 02:41:28.660

02:41:29.180 --> 02:41:30.580
Winner.

Keyboard mania in the house.

02:41:32.460 --> 02:41:35.500
Ought to be on VDR, or ought to be on 2DX.

02:41:35.500 --> 02:41:37.300
And the winner.

02:41:37.300 --> 02:41:38.940
This kind of makes me sad a little bit,

02:41:38.940 --> 02:41:40.700
because I know it'll be in 2DX anyway.

02:41:40.700 --> 02:41:43.260
But you did vote it, your number one choice,

02:41:43.260 --> 02:41:45.480

02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:54.240
parents rage wins

02:42:54.240 --> 02:42:59.220
i think the man from drink out that that's going to be rated

02:42:59.220 --> 02:43:03.020
is he going to grow from a mushroom

02:43:03.020 --> 02:43:05.420
as you take the mushrooms you'll see it grow

02:43:05.420 --> 02:43:09.260
you know it's that he knows what he is you're going to that guy c man and he

02:43:09.260 --> 02:43:11.260
He ends up being a boss in a Konami game.

02:43:11.260 --> 02:43:13.260
What is up with that, you know?

02:43:13.260 --> 02:43:19.260
Doesn't that guy from Seaman look just like the boss that's in Contra, the new Contra game?

02:43:19.260 --> 02:43:21.260
Yeah, the shriveled space game.

02:43:21.260 --> 02:43:24.260
Ooh, I'm coming undone. Ah, ah, ah, ah.

02:43:24.260 --> 02:43:26.260
Talking about that fish.

02:43:26.260 --> 02:43:29.260
I got it all over the ground.

02:43:29.260 --> 02:43:34.260
They're suggesting in the chatroom that Rob's voice the game, Slut Edition.

02:43:34.260 --> 02:43:41.740
I don't know what y'all got against politics, shit ass!

02:43:41.740 --> 02:43:46.460
Gumby says pantsless sky voice game, no, hell no!

02:43:46.460 --> 02:43:47.460
Hell no.

02:43:47.460 --> 02:43:49.020
I thought you wanted to show off your cock.

02:43:49.020 --> 02:43:53.620
Only in a freestyle routine, I'm not gonna show off my cock, what are you talking about?

02:43:53.620 --> 02:43:56.880
That's just radio, that's radio funny, oh you weren't here for that.

02:43:56.880 --> 02:44:00.780
I said why doesn't anybody in a GDR freestyle routine whip out their cock at the end of

02:44:00.780 --> 02:44:01.780
it?

02:44:01.780 --> 02:44:04.780
Everyone knows you're just a big ol' slut.

02:44:04.780 --> 02:44:05.780
Haha.

02:44:05.780 --> 02:44:07.780
What? I'm sorry, all I heard was nails.

02:44:07.780 --> 02:44:10.780
Why does everybody think I'm a slut? I haven't gotten laid in forever.

02:44:10.780 --> 02:44:11.780
Do you all think I'm a slut?

02:44:11.780 --> 02:44:13.780
Slut? Slut? What?

02:44:13.780 --> 02:44:14.780
Ugh.

02:44:14.780 --> 02:44:16.780
Aw, here you go again.

02:44:16.780 --> 02:44:18.780
Okay, capin' on Paul Terre.

02:44:18.780 --> 02:44:19.780
One of the most...

02:44:19.780 --> 02:44:20.780
She is the most...

02:44:20.780 --> 02:44:21.780
The most...

02:44:21.780 --> 02:44:22.780
Slutty?

02:44:22.780 --> 02:44:23.780
Wait, no, no, no, no!

02:44:23.780 --> 02:44:26.780
She's the most talented musician in the world.

02:44:26.780 --> 02:44:28.780
Ever.

02:44:28.780 --> 02:44:31.780
Yeah, too bad she's Naoki.

02:44:31.780 --> 02:44:34.780
Is this before or after she gave you a blowjob?

02:44:34.780 --> 02:44:43.780
She may be the most talented musician in the world, but she's not talented at music. She's talented in other ways, she's just also a musician.

02:44:43.780 --> 02:44:46.780
That may be so.

02:44:46.780 --> 02:44:50.780
They're having a group orgy! It's Hybro Uroby, the group orgy, okay?

02:44:50.780 --> 02:44:57.780
You've got, you know, the DDR All-Stars, which is basically, you know, B4U, you know, all them buck naked, freakin' just gettin' freaky.

02:44:57.780 --> 02:45:04.780
And then you've got, then you've got Politary in the mix there, and some other chick that we don't remember her name because she doesn't really matter, because they all suck.

02:45:04.780 --> 02:45:09.780
And then, ew, the Naoki's in there. Oh, screw Naoki, he can be out of the, he can be filming.

02:45:09.780 --> 02:45:12.780
I'm sorry, I think Jenny Rom's a bigger slut than Politary.

02:45:12.780 --> 02:45:15.780
We already know that half of B4U is really Naoki, too.

02:45:15.780 --> 02:45:19.780
Have you heard the new Polteri song where she plays the didgeridoo?

02:45:19.780 --> 02:45:23.780
Come on, guys! She's Australian! Fucking kill my joke!

02:45:23.780 --> 02:45:27.780
There's been a sniper shooting!

02:45:27.780 --> 02:45:31.780
Okay, she stopped doing the didgeridoo sound after I...

02:45:31.780 --> 02:45:35.780
Ah! I like Black Lab's term

02:45:35.780 --> 02:45:39.780
for Polteri. Ostrasion.

02:45:39.780 --> 02:45:43.780
She's Ostrasion.

02:45:43.780 --> 02:45:54.940
oh god they're criticizing me because we've said slut like 20 times and

02:45:54.940 --> 02:45:57.540
haven't played the

02:45:57.540 --> 02:46:04.540
I thought she needed to be pressed, Rob.

02:46:04.540 --> 02:46:11.540
We banned her from the remainder of the year.

02:46:11.540 --> 02:46:14.540
Alright, that's enough.

02:46:14.540 --> 02:46:21.540
We hate politics, and we want politics.

02:46:21.540 --> 02:46:23.540
We banned her from the remainders of the year.

02:46:24.540 --> 02:46:25.540
Alright, that's enough.

02:46:25.540 --> 02:46:28.540
Because we hate Paula Terry and we want all of her balls to die.

02:46:28.540 --> 02:46:35.540
I don't know what, this chat room is obsessed with my cock and me giving lap dances and me being a slut and like all this other stuff.

02:46:40.540 --> 02:46:41.540
This is scary.

02:46:41.540 --> 02:46:42.540
I need the chat room's help.

02:46:42.540 --> 02:46:44.540
Why would you call Matt a slut? He's a bigger slut than I am.

02:46:44.540 --> 02:46:45.540
I am.

02:46:45.540 --> 02:46:46.540
Say it again.

02:46:46.540 --> 02:46:47.540
Yeah, I'm sorry.

02:46:47.540 --> 02:46:48.540
What?

02:46:48.540 --> 02:47:02.780
Well, he is correct, but that's not the point, okay?

02:47:02.780 --> 02:47:05.140
I am the biggest slut of them all.

02:47:05.140 --> 02:47:08.460
Oh, sorry, Rob.

02:47:08.460 --> 02:47:15.100
All your sluts are blunt to us.

02:47:15.100 --> 02:47:18.500
I'm just going to do the hotkey here.

02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:27.720
Hey, hey, they have loose slop in Reno.

02:47:27.720 --> 02:47:32.460
Tricked you, almost got you, I thought I was going to say slut, but.

02:47:32.460 --> 02:47:37.460
They need to change it, still you're in my part.

02:47:37.460 --> 02:47:44.460
Let's see, in the chat room, they're saying Matt is not a slut, he's a one-woman man whore.

02:47:44.460 --> 02:47:45.460
That's cute.

02:47:45.460 --> 02:47:46.460
I still...

02:47:46.460 --> 02:47:47.460
Ah.

02:47:47.460 --> 02:47:49.460
The song should be called...

02:47:49.460 --> 02:47:54.460
SoCalKicks suggest Dave is a slut to his hand.

02:47:54.460 --> 02:47:59.460
Yes, Jamie.

02:47:59.460 --> 02:48:06.460
Here's a slut to the Crisco can.

02:48:11.180 --> 02:48:13.860
Crisco doesn't work!

02:48:13.860 --> 02:48:17.880
What the hell are you talking about? What would you suggest, being the expert on the show?

02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:23.780
I don't know, saliva.

02:48:23.780 --> 02:48:27.260
Here's my opinion on the whole thing. God, I can't believe we finally brought this on the show.

02:48:27.260 --> 02:48:30.260
It's over. Welcome to the last episode of Orange Wilder, buddy.

02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:32.260
Bomani what? DDR what?

02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:34.260
Okay, well let's see here.

02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:39.260
See, the thing that really sucks about all those freaking loops is they get sticky after a while, okay?

02:48:39.760 --> 02:48:40.760
That just sucks, okay?

02:48:41.260 --> 02:48:43.260
Okay, no more masturbation chat.

02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:45.760
We need Mr. Spanky for this.

02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:53.260
Okay, you just get two Ziploc bags, you fill them with hot water, and you tape them together so they're kind of like a little, you know, and then you just...

02:48:53.260 --> 02:49:02.540
What was that, Jamie? That was a C-bomb! Oh! Did the delay get that?

02:49:02.540 --> 02:49:06.380
I don't know if the mics got it or what. We don't have a delay. We're a shitty radio,

02:49:06.380 --> 02:49:13.100
remember? That was beautiful, Jamie. That was so awesome.

02:49:13.100 --> 02:49:15.860
Remember, folks, the FCC does not approve of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:49:15.860 --> 02:49:25.300
fucking fcc with chrisco's sticky lube

02:49:25.300 --> 02:49:29.580
it's all about the ziploc bags in the water

02:49:29.580 --> 02:49:32.260
two ziploc bags, this sounds like

02:49:32.260 --> 02:49:33.340
we have a slut call

02:49:33.340 --> 02:49:42.780
and for the record i said like a big ol' cut

02:49:42.780 --> 02:49:47.200
Okay, we have a suggestion from the chat room that we need to change the topic, and we should

02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:48.700
talk about cake.

02:49:48.700 --> 02:49:52.380
Frankly, I think cake makes a crappy lube.

02:49:52.380 --> 02:49:54.620
Frosting, maybe.

02:49:54.620 --> 02:50:00.780
You can do so many fun things with frosting.

02:50:00.780 --> 02:50:02.780
There's the butter spray.

02:50:02.780 --> 02:50:10.780
Of course, I think that we should actually get the tips from the people who actually

02:50:10.780 --> 02:50:13.220
We have cocks.

02:50:13.220 --> 02:50:27.700
What they really need is to coat your cock in teflon, okay?

02:50:27.700 --> 02:50:30.140
Cuz nothing will stick to it, is that why they need it?

02:50:30.140 --> 02:50:31.140
Exactly!

02:50:31.140 --> 02:50:33.540
But how do they get teflon to stick to your dick if nothing sticks to teflon?

02:50:33.540 --> 02:50:34.820
Well how do they do it with pots?

02:50:34.820 --> 02:50:35.820
Shit man, how do they do it there?

02:50:35.820 --> 02:50:36.820
You know what?

02:50:36.820 --> 02:50:39.820
Okay, okay, okay.

02:50:39.820 --> 02:50:44.820
Just cock stroking chat. You're all a bunch of cock masters.

02:50:44.820 --> 02:50:46.820
I resent that.

02:50:46.820 --> 02:50:48.820
You're not the master of your cock?

02:50:48.820 --> 02:50:51.820
I want to talk about that Joan soda you had the other day, Rob.

02:50:51.820 --> 02:50:53.820
Hi.

02:50:53.820 --> 02:50:55.820
Nice cock.

02:50:55.820 --> 02:50:57.820
You're a little...

02:50:57.820 --> 02:50:59.820
Right.

02:50:59.820 --> 02:51:01.820
Oh, speaking of which...

02:51:01.820 --> 02:51:02.820
Oh, we went to get the...

02:51:02.820 --> 02:51:05.820
Oh, Irene, you have the biggest cock here in the room right now.

02:51:05.820 --> 02:51:07.820
Really?

02:51:07.820 --> 02:51:10.820
What do you like to do with your cock?

02:51:10.820 --> 02:51:14.820
Well, I mostly like to masturbate. Sometimes I like to pee.

02:51:14.820 --> 02:51:16.820
With buck futter?

02:51:16.820 --> 02:51:18.820
Yes, sure.

02:51:18.820 --> 02:51:22.820
Buck futter. The day is mine.

02:51:22.820 --> 02:51:25.820
This show went to the toilet about three hours ago.

02:51:25.820 --> 02:51:26.820
Show back.

02:51:26.820 --> 02:51:28.820
I think it went about like 40 episodes ago.

02:51:28.820 --> 02:51:32.820
I have to ask you about the penis, mightier.

02:51:32.820 --> 02:51:35.820
Anal bum covers.

02:51:35.820 --> 02:51:43.300
Oh, maybe they should have like DD or UpCock cam.

02:51:43.300 --> 02:51:46.460
It sounds like something you have to get like a surgery, like you know how when you get

02:51:46.460 --> 02:51:52.320
tested for STDs, they sit there, right in the penal.

02:51:52.320 --> 02:51:53.980
Some of us haven't had to.

02:51:53.980 --> 02:51:55.300
I haven't either, I've heard stories.

02:51:55.300 --> 02:52:01.740
No, it's so funny, once I was at In-N-Out, and my mom thought, yeah, that was funny.

02:52:01.740 --> 02:52:03.180
In-N-Out, cock, get it?

02:52:03.180 --> 02:52:10.740
The person next to us was reading a magazine called Therapist, and the person reading it

02:52:10.740 --> 02:52:14.700
was obviously some therapist who subscribed to the monthly magazine or whatever.

02:52:14.700 --> 02:52:18.220
My mom pointed out, she's like, you know that if you put a space between the first three

02:52:18.220 --> 02:52:24.580
letters, it says The Rapist, and she's just like, oh my God.

02:52:24.580 --> 02:52:29.540
My mom's like, yeah, you'll never look at that word the same again.

02:52:29.540 --> 02:52:32.220
Still you're in those parts.

02:52:32.220 --> 02:52:37.020
No Stylin is doing his typical interesting random comments here in the chatroom and he

02:52:37.020 --> 02:52:40.320
says, who wants to go to DDR camp?

02:52:40.320 --> 02:52:42.220
What the hell would DDR camp be?

02:52:42.220 --> 02:52:44.620
Is that like a...

02:52:44.620 --> 02:52:45.620
I don't know.

02:52:45.620 --> 02:52:48.060
Is this one time at DDR camp?

02:52:48.060 --> 02:52:50.580
Is that like a camp where they're going to kill us all?

02:52:50.580 --> 02:52:56.160
This one time at DDR camp, I played Beat It Mania.

02:52:56.160 --> 02:53:00.740
This one time at DDR camp, they made all the girls wear skirts and then they put cameras

02:53:00.740 --> 02:53:02.740
was in the floor and made them dance.

02:53:02.740 --> 02:53:03.740
Weeee.

02:53:03.740 --> 02:53:04.740
Um.

02:53:04.740 --> 02:53:06.740
I just like, weeee.

02:53:06.740 --> 02:53:12.740
Who would be the first counselor at DDR camp to try and molest somebody?

02:53:12.740 --> 02:53:13.740
Loki.

02:53:13.740 --> 02:53:15.740
Loki has his hand up.

02:53:15.740 --> 02:53:17.740
Uh, I didn't have anything to say.

02:53:17.740 --> 02:53:18.740
Oh, he was volunteering.

02:53:18.740 --> 02:53:21.740
Okay, how many DDR players are hard up for dates?

02:53:21.740 --> 02:53:22.740
All of them.

02:53:22.740 --> 02:53:23.740
Not me.

02:53:23.740 --> 02:53:24.740
Oh, and not you.

02:53:24.740 --> 02:53:25.740
Almost all of them.

02:53:25.740 --> 02:53:26.740
Wait, no, no.

02:53:26.740 --> 02:53:28.740
No, I take that back because now...

02:53:28.740 --> 02:53:31.740
All of them that aren't involved with Orange Lounge. Ha ha ha.

02:53:31.740 --> 02:53:39.740
Okay, I would say that would go towards any females. Obviously I would not want to molest any guys because that's just weird.

02:53:39.740 --> 02:53:41.740
Wait, what? You have a girlfriend?

02:53:41.740 --> 02:53:46.740
Yeah, but this is hypothetical. Hypothetical can't hurt me.

02:53:47.740 --> 02:53:49.740
Not hypothetical, just pathetic.

02:53:51.740 --> 02:53:54.740
I'm hyperpathetical. I'm hyperpathetical, okay?

02:53:55.740 --> 02:53:57.740
Hyperglycemic?

02:53:57.740 --> 02:53:58.740
Telepathetical.

02:53:58.740 --> 02:53:59.740
All right.

02:53:59.740 --> 02:54:00.740
I was telepathetic.

02:54:00.740 --> 02:54:06.820
EOSFVB expresses great disappointment that we went through that whole segment about masturbating

02:54:06.820 --> 02:54:10.980
and didn't bring up lotion, and then says, and then more than Jake says, it puts the

02:54:10.980 --> 02:54:13.180
lotion in its skin and puts it in the basket.

02:54:13.180 --> 02:54:14.860
Well, they didn't really finish.

02:54:14.860 --> 02:54:18.900
They stole the mic from me before I could finish, but yeah, lotion would definitely

02:54:18.900 --> 02:54:19.900
work.

02:54:19.900 --> 02:54:22.140
Actually, that's pretty good.

02:54:22.140 --> 02:54:25.180
It puts the lotion on its skin or it gets the hose again.

02:54:25.180 --> 02:54:26.700
How about a dead baby joke?

02:54:26.700 --> 02:54:28.700
More than the Jake wants us to tell a dead baby joke.

02:54:28.700 --> 02:54:29.700
Alright, here it is.

02:54:29.700 --> 02:54:32.700
How many dead babies does it take to screw in a lightbulb?

02:54:32.700 --> 02:54:33.700
How many?

02:54:33.700 --> 02:54:34.700
None, they're dead!

02:54:34.700 --> 02:54:39.700
Alright, well there's one, I'm just going to read this one from the chatroom.

02:54:39.700 --> 02:54:40.700
What is a dead baby?

02:54:40.700 --> 02:54:41.700
What?

02:54:41.700 --> 02:54:43.700
A baby that is dead.

02:54:43.700 --> 02:54:44.700
That's not funny.

02:54:44.700 --> 02:54:46.700
Why is people laughing?

02:54:46.700 --> 02:54:50.700
More than Jake says, what's the difference between a pile of dead babies and a Corvette?

02:54:50.700 --> 02:54:51.700
What?

02:54:51.700 --> 02:54:53.700
I don't have a Corvette in the garage.

02:54:53.700 --> 02:54:55.700
That's pretty funny.

02:54:55.700 --> 02:54:59.540
Alright, we're getting about to that time where we're going to end the damn show, so

02:54:59.540 --> 02:55:02.140
we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, so let's start with all the

02:55:02.140 --> 02:55:04.340
guests tonight, starting in the back with Dave.

02:55:04.340 --> 02:55:07.580
Dave, what's your final thought of the day?

02:55:07.580 --> 02:55:14.580
Homework sucks. I have school tomorrow. That is bullshit. It's school. Finals are coming.

02:55:16.180 --> 02:55:19.180
Nooooooooooooooo.

02:55:19.180 --> 02:55:24.980
Give me that.

02:55:24.980 --> 02:55:29.980
Okay, I don't quite understand the school system over here. Why would you have finals after a break?

02:55:29.980 --> 02:55:33.980
See, back where I come from, we have finals before we go and vegetate.

02:55:33.980 --> 02:55:34.980
Thank you very much.

02:55:34.980 --> 02:55:39.980
Sorry, sorry. So you can forget everything.

02:55:39.980 --> 02:55:42.980
Apparently he's almost gone.

02:55:42.980 --> 02:55:44.980
Somebody pass the mic to somebody else.

02:55:44.980 --> 02:55:46.980
Brad, what's your final thought of the day?

02:55:46.980 --> 02:55:50.980
My final thought is, what do you get when you cross an owl on a bungee cord?

02:55:50.980 --> 02:55:53.980
My ass!

02:55:53.980 --> 02:55:57.980
I thought you were going to say cunt, fuck, shit, dick, ass, pussy.

02:55:57.980 --> 02:55:58.980
Moving on.

02:55:58.980 --> 02:56:00.920
We haven't gotten to the last part of it.

02:56:00.920 --> 02:56:01.920
Moving on.

02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:02.920
Stress up.

02:56:02.920 --> 02:56:03.920
Your final thought of the day.

02:56:03.920 --> 02:56:08.360

02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:20.420

For your 18th birthday, we'll take you to the Buddy Ranch.

Fuck that, man. We can take you to the strip club, okay?

02:57:52.200 --> 02:57:57.200
And most of the chicks there give head when you go into the private dances.

02:57:57.200 --> 02:58:03.200
So I've heard. I've never actually had it happen, but...

02:58:03.200 --> 02:58:05.200
Brad's doing the dancer dance.

02:58:05.200 --> 02:58:06.200
Happy Buddy!

02:58:06.200 --> 02:58:08.200
No, you have to have a Barbie doll.
