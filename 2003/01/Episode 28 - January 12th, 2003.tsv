1523	2824	What should we expect from your routine today?
2844	3585	Is it a big secret?
3745	5926	Can you give us any details before you go?
7487	8327	One word.
9088	9808	Shades.
12429	13290	Message for you, son.
13750	14551	Attention!
15611	19073	Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
21114	26157	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
29805	32706	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
33046	36206	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
36786	39507	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
40047	42927	Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
43727	44128	Just kidding.
44328	45928	Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
46128	53589	In this episode... Hey, are there any balls down there?
53849	56310	That's the biggest berry you've ever seen, Jingleberry.
56410	58150	What's your favorite scary movie?
59565	60165	Showgirls.
61066	62126	Absolutely frightful.
62467	63067	What's yours?
63287	65748	There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
65808	67069	Don't torture yourself.
67709	68510	That's my job.
68630	70431	Now's the time our sprockets made me dogs!
70491	75133	I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too.
75554	76454	I know Kung Fu.
76814	79156	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
79456	81317	Why did they have to take the word gay?
82918	85359	Nobody expects us punishing physicians.
85819	86680	It's Kendo.
86720	87340	Kendo!
89517	91318	DarkSakura, Shut up!
91519	92199	Where's my gun?
92319	94261	This is my boomstick!
94741	97263	Sky, Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!
97563	101286	Loki, I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.
101366	104108	What kind of warping being would find that funny?
104389	106070	Orange Lounge Radio.
108292	111754	We are live, and this is episode number 28 for January the 12th of 2003.
111814	112535	You're tuned in to the B...
120340	123081	I'm wanting to do this particular show in a Michael Jackson style.
146757	147777	Say hello to DarkSakura.
147817	148938	I just picked Rob.
149378	150139	That was cool.
151559	152660	And, oh, somebody's at the door.
152680	153320	We have door.
153621	155162	Did you bring hot man sex with you?
156022	157363	Yes, hot man sex is in my purse.
157623	159124	Okay, we'll get to that later.
160365	164507	This episode, number 28, we'll be doing the Fremont tourney wrap-up.
164727	166108	And you'll have to excuse us in advance.
166148	167309	We're all a little out of it today.
168310	169410	Two of us have had headaches.
169570	170751	One of us has been coughing.
171131	172052	And one of us is late.
172832	173473	Say hello to Loki.
173493	173793	There he is.
174412	175632	I mean, I'm having a baby.
177793	180534	Only if your water breaks, I don't know.
180574	184115	We're just really freaking tired after yesterday.
184135	186295	I'm feeling better, though.
186335	189976	I was in a really pissy mood, but I saw destruction on the way here, so I was happy.
190697	192137	Yes, destruction is always fun.
194938	195838	Oh, happy birthday...
197566	201689	A happy birthday wish, by the way, to Dark Tetsuya.
202709	203470	They're gonna breathe!
203930	206091	Oh my god, he got another ferret.
206111	206692	And there's the door.
206732	207252	Someone get the door.
207292	208513	We have more guests coming in.
208693	209713	Oh my god, I need to get one.
209773	212275	There's another... Shit.
212535	213476	We have another ferret.
213496	215637	There are now two ferrets on Orange Lounge Radio.
216498	217418	Oh, this is sad.
219668	228432	I got this ferret over at the outlet malls, it was only $1.99, and actually what's kind of funny is it says that this is a baby coyote.
228712	232374	Now, to my knowledge, coyotes do not look like ferrets.
233074	236296	I don't understand how this is a coyote, or whatever.
237683	240084	Do you know at that Long's that we went to?
240584	240824	Yes.
241184	241945	Fuck my diet.
243665	250568	No, at the Walgreens, at the Long's that we went to in Fremont, they had gigantic ones of these.
251108	251769	I almost got one.
251789	252429	Gigantic ones.
252609	257391	And don't forget, yesterday there was a horse, and we'll hear about that in the interviews a little later.
257411	258351	Oh, what, you mean Hot Man Sex?
258671	265114	No, not Hot Man Sex, the actual horse that Corey had that was, you know, made for a man but pH balanced for a woman type thing.
265134	265434	Yeah.
267941	269702	Anyway, yeah, it's going to be one of those shows.
269962	271223	DarkTipsTV summed it up right there.
271343	272464	Happy 24th, by the way.
274365	276187	Okay, so let's...
278850	282813	Let's say hello to Morian Studio guests before we get to the first break.
287838	290160	Wow, there's chaos going on here.
290220	291981	I feel like I'm in the middle of Gumby's routine.
292041	294423	Jesus.
294723	295464	Say hello to Brad.
296285	297926	Another step has entered the game.
298687	299507	Say hello to Irene.
299527	299968	Hi, guys.
301308	302889	and Dave is over there too.
303749	304229	Dave, say hi.
304389	304589	Hi.
304809	305829	Dave, you look like a monk.
306650	307470	You know it, baby.
307930	308170	All right.
308470	309810	We better go to break right now.
309871	310351	Now's a good time.
310871	319613	Let's do a break with some... We'll do a break with some songs from Xtreme because Xtreme is spreading across the country like a bad case of herpes.
319793	321233	It's extremely extreme.
321634	322894	Soon to be in your neighborhood.
323854	324774	Yeah, Rob spread it.
324954	325535	Hi, guys.
325575	326995	You're listening to Orange Islands Radio.
330271	331352	Thank you for watching!
331372	332372	See you next time!
362563	364044	Thank you for watching.
364244	364984	See you next time.
389628	390710	Thank you for watching!
513792	515217	Here's one by request.
515518	516903	This is V, the Extreme Edit.
568426	570468	Lyrics, Composition, Lyrics, Lyrics
598925	599886	Thanks for watching!
622958	624419	Hi everybody, this is DSDS.
624439	628241	Make sure to visit SoCalKicks.com and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
628461	631442	We finally accomplished ultimate evolution just now.
632823	634384	And then you make the horses have sex.
635664	636465	Oh, wait, are we live?
636505	637545	Yes, I just turned the mics on.
637945	639586	And then you make the horses have sex.
640266	641487	You pick your horses and they breed.
642242	643903	They go off into the distance.
644583	647565	They go off into the distance and there's a dramatic fade out.
647585	650026	And next thing you see, you see the mommy horse and the baby horse.
650886	652267	And the baby horse goes, Hi!
652527	653387	I'm the baby horse!
653508	654368	You get to name me!
654808	656249	So I named my hot man sex.
656669	657089	Alright.
657790	659110	Mommy, where do baby horses come from?
659130	660891	Yeah, we're talking about Derby Owners Club.
661992	662912	Virtual horses.
662992	663672	I'll own you.
663933	664833	That game is crack.
666634	666694	Um...
667914	669256	And then I named mine Takumi.
670078	672181	No, you don't have any horses.
672361	673984	I know, I was just joking.
674244	676908	But then you train your horses.
676928	680915	You train your horses, and then you make them run around.
681536	683557	and then you drown them like Matt did.
684618	686279	I drowned my horse three times.
686840	687880	It was being mean.
688220	694645	For those that are completely lost right now, we're talking about a new game, somewhat new game, called Derby Owner's Club.
694685	697146	Now this game, it's worse than DDR.
697467	701069	It is a bigger drug than DDR ever is.
701109	710856	It's kind of like DDR is like DDR is kind of like, I don't know, like DDR is kind of like pot.
711916	714517	and Derby Owners Club is kind of like just straight up smack.
715477	716038	Heroin.
716258	731143	Because like, the straight up smack is way more expensive and there's not as much to it, you know, you just kind of take the smack, you know, you don't have to worry about... Anyway, the point I'm trying to make, what the hell is Derby Owners Club?
731203	732724	It's like these big just...
733661	739762	Giant seizure buttons you use to beat your horse, and you throw 250 into the machine each time.
739803	740883	You beat them and bond them.
741003	743283	And you just beat them and you bond with them.
743463	745124	That's all Derby Owners Club is.
745664	748985	And yet, I find myself strangely addicted to it.
750065	752346	We're going to tell everybody our horses, but mine are last.
752486	753346	Rob, what's your horse's name?
753986	755806	My horses are out in the car still, I believe.
756226	756747	Or, I don't know.
756787	759547	But my horses, I have Miss Thang, which I made in Irvine.
760127	762488	And then I have Beaver Fever, which I made last night at Milpitas.
763894	765398	Okay, I've got BJ...
767509	769470	I've got BJ, the horse I made in Irvine.
769691	772753	I've Cloud, the horse I jacked from the little girl in Irvine.
773093	775715	Then I have the two horses I made in Milpitas last night.
775755	780198	We have Big Black Cock and Mr. Spanky.
780739	783541	And Mr. Spanky's being an ass, so I beat the shit out of him.
785162	788624	He wanted the coconut, but he wasn't good enough, so I gave him the hay.
789445	790986	So that's it.
791006	792267	We're being corrected in the chat room.
792327	795209	Derby Owner's Club at Milpitas Golf Line actually costs $2.25 a game.
795289	796110	Sorry, Milton.
797637	802160	Not if you're making any horse, then it's three.
805322	808304	If you're thinking in terms of tokens, it's being a quarter apiece.
809284	811626	Anyway, it's expensive.
812186	812726	My horses.
813707	815708	I have my first horse, which is Slytherin Chaser.
815868	817790	He's all black and he's a naughty horse.
819391	822573	Then my next horse... Oh, by the way, Slytherin Chaser likes oranges.
823333	824734	Then my next horse is... I like cheese.
826255	827916	and my next one is HotManSex.
829337	830177	That was my best horse.
830217	831718	I won like third place with that one.
832259	834040	Then my next horse is MmFajitas.
835801	838583	And my fifth horse is Jin Kazama.
840884	843786	So you spent like $30 on this game or something?
844006	844286	Twelve.
844766	845146	Twelve?
846267	846767	Wow, wait.
846888	848148	You had like five cards though.
849249	852391	That's $3 times five is fifteen.
853692	858036	I had two of my games paid for and then Matt loaned me money.
858517	858817	Thank you.
859738	860199	Oh, great.
860219	861740	I have other people buying you drugs.
864203	865364	That's when you know you're addicted.
866045	867226	Pretty soon you're going to be going to meetings.
867366	867826	Oh, I'm sorry.
868847	869208	Excuse me.
871368	872889	Anyway, well, Jamie has left the building.
874590	876592	Let's just go around the room and talk about our week.
876632	878653	Because we don't really have any structure to Orange Lounge Radio.
878913	880635	I know we've got a lot of new people joining us tonight.
880655	882536	They're tuning in to hear tonight's Fremont interviews.
882956	884257	And we will get to those in just a sec.
884297	885758	But welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
886038	887800	We're B-Money Talk Radio.
887840	898207	We talk about DDR2DX, Big Black Cox, masturbating with cake mix, and all sorts of various random things, basically, that have nothing to do with each other.
898247	898287	No.
898307	898347	No.
898527	899588	And porn makes the ratings go up.
899608	900109	And go to, um...
919689	924192	Go to our website at orangelounge.skie.cx and join in the chat.
924232	925473	Because our chat room is insane.
925813	927735	And play nice in the chat tonight, kids.
928055	928755	Play nice.
929116	929976	Or we'll beat you.
930376	932278	Or we'll whip you just like Mr. Spanky.
932338	933679	We'll whip you like a pony.
935360	935600	Anyway.
936000	936180	Yeah.
939227	940708	Thank you for watching!
961750	965732	Let's all go run out and smoke an ecstasy cigarette and come back and do the show and see what happens.
967933	969854	It smells like my mom's lasagna or something.
978599	979279	You are a dick.
979940	981160	This is yummy donut.
981720	983381	Smells like old antique store.
983962	985923	It does.
986303	986603	Ew.
987463	987844	Anyways.
990302	996486	Ingredients are Damiana, Wild Lettuce, Catnip, Passion, Flower, Mint, Love, and Light.
996846	997266	What's that?
998107	1001649	And manufactured by XTC Incorporated.
1001789	1002490	Baby, don't hurt me.
1002510	1003130	In Beverly Hills.
1003691	1004171	Don't hurt me no more.
1004211	1005031	And these are made by hippies.
1007493	1009434	Let's have some crack.
1010395	1013677	If I try out these cigarettes and I get horny, is anybody going to help me out here?
1014397	1015678	Don't look at me, look at Irene.
1016519	1017259	She's not in here.
1017279	1018580	Is it golden?
1019932	1021154	Don't look at me like that, Brad.
1021174	1022696	You're scaring me.
1024418	1026080	I thought I left the hot insects in the other room.
1027001	1029945	Okay, so anybody else want to talk about their week?
1029985	1030846	Something that happened this week?
1031327	1031807	Yes, Dave.
1032588	1032849	Dave.
1033408	1036169	I have finals next week, and it is crap.
1036870	1039231	And I was like, Mom, let me go to the show.
1039271	1040251	She's like, no, you have to study.
1040371	1041532	And I was like, Dad, let me go to the show.
1041712	1043593	And he's like, okay, but you have to study later.
1044013	1044993	So my dad is cool.
1045954	1048034	But when I get home, I have to study for an hour and a half.
1049355	1052136	Study means open the book.
1052536	1055358	And have the comic book that's really inside the book.
1055378	1056158	No, no, no, not that.
1056218	1058199	Just open the book, stare into it blankly.
1058703	1063085	I'm just going to listen to Orange Lounge and just be like, hey, it's music.
1064205	1067306	And then I kind of wake up later and be like, yeah, I've been studying the whole time.
1068727	1070968	In high school, I didn't study, and look where it got me.
1073066	1074987	Exactly why I am.
1075548	1077429	That's exactly the reason I am studying.
1077729	1078810	Why are you dressed like a monk?
1079431	1082813	Because I'm wearing... I know it's not because you want to remain virginal for the rest of your life.
1083113	1084034	Wait, wait, wait, look.
1084474	1084674	Look.
1084955	1085675	Look what I'm wearing.
1086075	1086175	Oh.
1086976	1087697	What's that say?
1087997	1088977	It says FUBU.
1090599	1091759	Oh, I haven't heard it before.
1092420	1093421	I'm black now.
1094161	1095402	No, no, no, no, no, no.
1096683	1098524	I have the big black cock now.
1098785	1099085	What?
1099305	1100446	Is this the Jewish FUBU?
1100486	1101366	Is that the Jewish... No.
1101406	1101486	No.
1102523	1102963	Jubu.
1106166	1107547	We will offend everyone.
1108868	1111890	You know, that's funny because there was a guy yesterday at Fremont that did a routine.
1111930	1112770	His name was The Jew.
1113331	1114812	Made me think of you.
1115212	1116073	That's not a good thing.
1116113	1117254	Wow, Rob.
1117314	1118514	I feel touched right here.
1118935	1122377	I have to say, this guy did some very original things.
1122397	1126660	I have to commend that guy for having the balls to do what he did on the routine.
1126680	1128181	Very homoerotic original things.
1129763	1134807	I bet when you watch the video, when you watch the video, you're going to notice I'm the only one laughing at that routine.
1135068	1138611	Okay, keep in mind, keep in mind, everybody had balls there yesterday.
1138731	1139172	Yeah, that's true.
1139212	1143536	Everybody had balls, but this guy had really big balls to be doing that stuff on stage.
1143556	1144897	Everybody else was doing normal dancing.
1144917	1146418	He had a big black cock to go with him.
1146579	1147519	Can you show us, Rob?
1148000	1148681	Show us what he did.
1149341	1153765	I'm sorry, EOSVB asked an excellent question which relates to last week's discussion.
1154066	1155707	Did he whip his cock out at the end of routine?
1155727	1159210	Because I was saying last week, nobody's done that yet and somebody needs to.
1159731	1160912	It would be the ultimate zing.
1161693	1163294	No, he did not whip his cock out.
1163314	1164635	The only cocks I saw were some people.
1164715	1167458	But I did almost get hit with his shirt.
1168759	1172943	I had to kind of pick it off the table with my pen that I was judging with.
1173563	1173824	Anyway.
1175480	1179281	Speaking of shirts, you had a Twinkie yesterday.
1180241	1180842	Ah, fuck.
1180962	1187443	Okay, Nakari, if you're listening, you a bitch.
1187523	1188764	No, seriously, Nakari's great.
1188784	1189384	He's a good guy.
1189664	1190224	I like him a lot.
1190744	1193065	But I get to the tournament, and I think I'm hot shit.
1193385	1194467	I hate myself and I want to die
1212147	1212728	He can't say it.
1212968	1214369	He goes, oh, no, you didn't.
1215449	1227537	And pretty soon, here are Nakari and I. And those of me out there that happen to know me a little better than just the radio and know Nakari know that Nakari and I have something in common that a lot of DDR people don't have in common.
1230859	1235042	It made it a lot funnier that we happen to be wearing the same shirt.
1235703	1237284	It's too bad that exhibition didn't happen.
1237724	1243789	Yeah, we were supposed to do an exhibition PA, but it didn't happen because he had to go to work and I had to go get batteries to do the tapes.
1243869	1246431	And was Nikari the Jew guy or was that different?
1246491	1247071	No, no, no, no.
1247131	1248472	No, no, completely different guy.
1248552	1249853	Now, what did you rate that guy?
1249913	1251754	You know, did you give him like a 100?
1252315	1257578	I'm not allowed to reveal how I rated people, but if you want to see the judges' towers, you can look at the results.
1257658	1259139	They're linked for the DDR Reef Freak thing.
1259159	1262642	I don't want to know about the judges' towers.
1265430	1266230	I don't need to know this.
1266330	1270712	I'm an innocent, pure-hearted... Oh, fuck.
1272413	1274674	Oh, you're having to resort to Berry Propel.
1274714	1278996	You've got to tell... Because the listeners that listen to Orange Lawns Radio know about your love obsession with Propel.
1279076	1282197	And yesterday, what did you find next door to the tournament?
1282617	1288580	Berry-flavored Propel has been dethroned as my favorite flavor of Propel.
1289120	1290720	They have peach-flavored Propel.
1291061	1293362	Because as everyone knows, I can drink a peach for hours.
1295089	1297390	Actually, I don't remember what line that movie came from, but I can eat it.
1298430	1299611	That would be Face Off.
1300591	1303992	That's Dan's favorite movie, which he actually broke by stepping on the laser disc.
1305553	1309534	So, um, but yeah, he says that all the time with our Animal Crossing town, because we have peaches.
1310154	1311855	But I can drink peaches now.
1312315	1313916	And look at Dan, seductively.
1314976	1315796	I'm drinking a peach.
1316276	1317077	Shut up.
1321418	1327223	Okay, we're going to get to those Fremont interviews in just a second here, but I want to have a serious moment here at the beginning of the show.
1327323	1332607	No, I want to have a serious moment here, because people died this week, and it kind of sucks.
1333447	1334868	One of the BGs passed away today.
1336370	1339452	Maurice Hibbs, I believe, was the BG that passed away today.
1339472	1342955	You don't even know the difference between them, do you?
1344055	1346037	I have the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack.
1346077	1346397	Thank you.
1346437	1348019	I have two copies on vinyl.
1348439	1349340	I like the Bee Gees.
1349760	1351021	I own the Katie Lang album.
1351161	1359208	Rob, besides being a band, I have no idea what the Bee Gees are, so maybe you could enlighten me.
1360208	1360829	I'm too young.
1361489	1363851	Stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
1364612	1365312	That was a Bee Gees.
1365373	1366453	You are such a baby.
1369596	1370056	That's it.
1370316	1372819	I'm going to burn you the best of the Bee Gees CD.
1372859	1373139	Do it.
1374750	1375210	That's right.
1375451	1376071	That's right, Dave.
1376111	1376552	Good shit.
1376572	1378113	You know, Rob, I find it very funny, though.
1378133	1379354	This is a very serious thing.
1379474	1385420	I was looking at your Yahoo thing, and I see how you have movies and stars and all of this.
1386541	1389123	And my... Excuse me.
1389673	1390713	How un-ladylike.
1390954	1391774	Congratulations.
1391894	1395155	And my Yahoo, that one tasted like my dinner.
1396356	1396876	Gross.
1397756	1404319	My Yahoo has like world events and when the next Harry Potter movie is supposed to come out.
1405419	1406300	Important things, yeah.
1406320	1409681	It has my horoscope, it has my comics, but it has world events.
1410141	1411982	Important things that are going to affect my life.
1412839	1413900	Subtitles by the Amara.org community
1433334	1433894	It doesn't matter.
1433954	1438917	You have to understand that the world has really nothing to fear because all the world's problems can be solved with nuclear weapons.
1439297	1442358	I mean, that's what we've learned from the movie The Core that's going to be coming out later on.
1442778	1449501	We learned, oh, hey, if the Earth's pole stops rotating, and I honestly didn't realize that the core of the Earth was rotating.
1449982	1450682	I guess it is.
1450922	1451362	That's amazing.
1451382	1452243	The movie said so.
1452263	1453023	It must be true.
1453683	1455024	Hey, are you drunk, Matt?
1455224	1456404	Your face is really red.
1456745	1457045	No.
1457565	1458305	He's not Asian.
1458345	1460686	He's so excited, and he just can't hide it.
1462447	1468610	he's about to lose control and he thinks he likes it I'm just so excited what is this, the gas episode?
1468690	1469111	Jesus
1473153	1477774	Also, no, also seriously, another famous celebrity that died this week that's very, very sad.
1477794	1478254	Roxette?
1478874	1479054	No.
1479414	1479754	Damn it.
1479794	1480254	No, no.
1480274	1481795	She has cancer, but she's not dying yet.
1481855	1482835	No, this is bigger than that.
1482855	1483615	This is bigger than that.
1484755	1486996	Oolong the Bunny died, ladies and gentlemen.
1487036	1487816	Oh my god!
1487836	1496277	Oolong the Bunny, the bunny that balances... The balance... The bunny that balances shit on its head.
1496477	1498118	And Oolong was a pig, by the way.
1499158	1499798	In Dragon Ball.
1499998	1500278	Okay.
1500778	1502119	Now you even got me on that one.
1502159	1503360	I think I'm too young for that one, too.
1504641	1505402	It's an internet joke.
1505442	1509445	Maybe somebody would be so kind to post the link to Along the Bunny so I can show some folks the pictures here.
1509465	1511066	I don't have time to... I want to see the pictures of the dead bunny.
1511707	1512848	No, it's horrible.
1512868	1513629	I want to see it.
1513649	1514709	You're horrible.
1514890	1516211	You're a horrible woman.
1516311	1516791	I want to see it.
1516811	1517191	I want to see it.
1518596	1522257	Hopefully somebody in the chatroom knows what I'm talking about when I talk about Ulan the Bunny.
1522277	1523258	Ah, Bunny's just arrived.
1523278	1524798	The cotton ball shoved up its ass.
1525998	1526659	God!
1528699	1530020	This is sad because I like bunnies.
1530060	1530460	You're going to hell.
1530480	1533861	You do know that you're the most popular host on this show in the chatroom.
1534441	1546108	You know, that's from, actually that's a quote from a movie, that was from the movie Table 1 I was talking about, a really shitty movie about these guys who wanted to open this restaurant lounge Doesn't anyone understand restaurant lounges don't survive?
1546329	1560697	And the movie, it didn't survive so they turned it into a strip club, and that's why the movie rocks This guy's gonna talk about movies all night long, he's just like So, yeah, um, the president died and, oh man, this movie I saw the other night sucks, man Anybody?
1560938	1561298	Come on
1562788	1566029	And also, another thing that died was this segment.
1567550	1569950	And Charlie's Angels 2 is gonna suck ass.
1570471	1570891	Duh.
1571151	1572131	The first one sucked ass.
1572151	1572351	Why?
1572411	1572711	Okay.
1573812	1575392	Okay, here's the trailer, okay?
1575532	1580034	They're on this bridge in this Russian, like, cargo truck thingy.
1580274	1583255	And there's a tank on one side, and a guy with an RPG on the other side.
1583535	1584075	So what do they do?
1584255	1586576	They're gonna drive the truck off the freaking dam.
1587697	1588657	Rocket Propelled Grenade.
1589658	1591660	Dragon Warrior?
1591860	1593962	I can tell you why the second Charlie's Angels movie is going to suck.
1594362	1595163	Demi Moore's in it.
1595223	1596203	Her career is over.
1596484	1599066	She belongs on the surreal life right now.
1599906	1605291	And they also took out... What's his name?
1606152	1606732	The comedian?
1607252	1607993	Bill Murray!
1608033	1609875	Bill Murray's not in it, so that's why it's going to suck.
1611416	1613057	His career's over too.
1613678	1615039	Bernie Mac is pretty funny.
1617333	1618074	I don't know, man.
1618154	1619316	He's... Well, it doesn't matter.
1619336	1621118	He doesn't really have a major part in the movie anyways.
1621318	1621999	Dave would know this.
1622901	1626065	Don't be a menace while drinking your juice or whatever.
1626726	1627006	What?
1627066	1627607	Wasn't he in that?
1628385	1629586	I have no idea what you're talking about.
1629606	1631387	Come on, you're our local ghetto Jew.
1632948	1634049	Hi, back to Bomani.
1634089	1634369	Hello.
1634649	1635330	Yeah, Bomani.
1635710	1635930	Hi.
1636551	1638052	Oh, Jamie's going to go blow her nose.
1638112	1639172	Okay, that's fine.
1639653	1642114	I think we're... Dave, take the chair.
1642315	1643015	The chair is mine.
1643035	1643876	Wait for like ten seconds.
1644036	1644536	Take a minute.
1644796	1645957	Okay, let's talk about this.
1646718	1650780	I've been given some lovely advanced MP3s from Corey the Sultan.
1652307	1654129	Corey the Sultan has given us some MP3s.
1654610	1656051	World premieres here right here.
1656071	1657172	You're not going to be able to hear them.
1657553	1658454	Can't download them.
1658874	1659935	Can't hear them anywhere else.
1660055	1660536	We've got them.
1660556	1661917	We're going to play them in this next break.
1662478	1665741	But I wanted to ask you guys that have played Xtreme now this week.
1665781	1666382	It's been out for a week.
1666402	1667443	What do you guys think of Xtreme?
1668604	1677708	Well, you know, I really, really, really, really liked it at first, and now I'm like, eh, it's cool and all, but I'm getting bored pretty fast, and that's bad.
1678769	1683651	Bad that I'm losing interest this fast, and we haven't even gotten ours yet, and I'm like, eh, whatever.
1685792	1686933	Yeah, um, I just...
1690083	1690983	Yeah, Rosal doesn't count.
1691744	1703869	I played, like, three games at CVGL earlier this week, and I got to play... I didn't have that... Can picking is not appropriate right now.
1707911	1708831	As I was saying.
1709291	1719296	Yeah, I got to play, like, three games, but it sucked because... Well, the game itself didn't suck because I could... It seems a hell of a lot easier to PA stuff because I was...
1721309	1723831	Let him finish, we'll get back to this, we'll get back to this.
1723871	1725332	It's the pancake bunny!
1725612	1726592	Let Black Lab finish!
1726632	1727533	Yes, let me finish!
1728013	1728834	God, people!
1730175	1740101	Okay, yeah, so I played it, I didn't hear the songs, and I was still doubling stuff, because I was, all I could hear was the Max 2 net right, like, 10 feet, or 10 inches away from it, so yeah.
1741081	1742842	It's easier to PA stuff on it.
1743503	1743703	Yeah.
1745043	1746784	You wanna know how I feel about Max?
1747305	1747885	I mean, sorry.
1748226	1748766	Extreme?
1749147	1749527	Extreme?
1750107	1750488	Max 2+.
1751449	1752329	Jamie's out of nuts.
1752710	1754051	That's how I feel about it.
1755032	1757694	Okay, so back to this, what we brought up on the internet here.
1757974	1765721	I was given a link in the chatroom, thank you very much to YoSFBB, to the We Love Oolong page, which has Oolong the Bunny balancing pancakes on his head here in the corner.
1768070	1768611	Excellent.
1768951	1774556	And I would like to read here a haiku that was written by a fan about Oolong the Bunny.
1775077	1775858	It looks like a jank.
1775878	1777079	Hold on, wait, hold on a minute.
1777159	1781723	I just need some background music because we're going to have a sad, serious moment here on Orange Zones Radio.
1781763	1784806	Now I realize where the pancake bunny joke came from.
1785107	1788930	I need to read a sad little haiku about Oolong the Bunny.
1789171	1790011	I need the music.
1790292	1791513	If you'll give me a minute here, please.
1791533	1791653	Okay.
1794458	1795358	Oh, okay, here we go.
1795378	1798720	Please, please, can we have a serious moment?
1798740	1799060	Please.
1801381	1803021	Hokkaido, Japan.
1804022	1808924	Oolong, the friend of children, bounds across the snow.
1811204	1811845	You bitch!
1815966	1818147	That verb was brought to you by Fairy Flavor and Propel.
1819648	1819948	Anyway.
1822671	1823552	You'll be serious.
1823732	1824353	You promise.
1824673	1825054	You promise.
1825074	1825534	I love that.
1825774	1826355	Alright.
1826475	1830580	Happiness is a Japanese rabbit who rests pancakes on his hand.
1830640	1831240	Alright.
1831601	1834003	Oh my god, that's such a cute bunny.
1835430	1838211	He's a fucking gorgeous bunny, and you all are really rude.
1838351	1839392	You are rude people.
1839932	1841272	I don't know why I let you in my house.
1841393	1841633	Okay.
1841693	1849656	So did he, did they say how... Now, now, did he try to balance, like, say, I don't know, a ten-ton safe on his head, and is that what did him in, you know?
1850696	1851497	How did he die?
1852577	1852877	Okay.
1853818	1856439	Let's, um... You wanna, we were gonna read another one?
1856499	1857039	Hold on, hold on.
1857079	1857479	Here's another.
1857899	1858360	You're gonna read one?
1859060	1860821	I don't know if I can trust you with reading these.
1860941	1862401	Alright, alright, here we go.
1862601	1862761	Shh.
1863282	1863662	Shh, shh.
1865984	1866945	Fur is murder.
1868907	1870989	That's not what it, that's the person who wrote it.
1871490	1880919	Um, Oolong hops around, and we left him for it, so, hop Oolong, hop now, big black cock.
1885323	1887704	I'm still trying to figure out how this rabbit died.
1888084	1889964	It had heart failure or some shit like that.
1889984	1890985	Heart failure in my ass.
1891365	1892565	It's a cover-up, I say!
1892745	1894845	He's trying to bail out the 10-ton safe on his fucking head!
1894905	1897506	Are you saying it faked its own death to sell more albums?
1897866	1898206	Yes!
1899287	1901207	It's like the Elvis of the furry kingdom.
1901487	1902227	It's like Tupac.
1902467	1905228	He's hiding away on the secret island, waiting for his return.
1905448	1906668	Long live Tupac!
1907709	1908309	What the hell?
1910437	1914680	I think that Oolong died of embarrassment from having to bounce pancakes on his head.
1918323	1919684	Post this in the chatroom.
1919744	1921946	No, YoSFEB actually posted this in the chatroom.
1921986	1928211	It's a picture of the Al-Qaeda having the big picture of Osama Bin Laden with the bird is evil thing there.
1928551	1933755	And if you look very carefully towards the middle left, there's Oolong the bunny with pancakes on his head.
1938085	1940207	That means that he's living off with Bin Laden.
1942009	1942950	You guys are sick.
1943351	1944732	I want to see the picture of Dead Bunny.
1945192	1946534	You cannot see the picture of Dead Bunny.
1946554	1947114	Dead Bunny.
1947194	1948456	I don't have the picture of Dead Bunny.
1948496	1949196	Nobody's given me the link yet.
1949216	1950457	Somebody said it was on the site.
1950497	1956403	Somebody says that they have a picture of a goat say picture of the pancake bunny.
1956804	1957705	I don't want to see that.
1960407	1970153	Now it's become this new, like... It's become the tourist guy, the new tourist guy, the guy that was on... You know what the tourist guy was?
1970173	1975036	The guy that was in that picture, supposedly the plane hitting the building, and then they put him in all these pictures.
1978538	1980279	Okay, this is really bad radio.
1980299	1982321	I'm not going to look through all these pictures right now.
1983536	1984418	I don't know.
1984738	1985920	We have Ferret Nookie.
1986080	1988724	But Oolong the Bunny is... Oh, look, look, here you go.
1988844	1989465	Little picture.
1989605	1990566	A little avatar you can use.
1990586	1991528	Happy Pancake Bunny.
1991748	1992309	It's so cute!
1995253	1996354	I want a bunny!
1997105	1998466	You can't have a money.
1998726	1999227	All right.
1999527	1999907	All right.
2001088	2002730	Now's a good time to take a break, I believe.
2002750	2003991	I cry for humanity.
2005912	2007454	We're going to take a break.
2007934	2013419	As promised, as promised, some brand spanking new EX songs.
2014920	2017422	And when we come back, that Fremont coverage.
2017462	2018543	My spirit wins.
2019784	2021305	Let me load up those songs.
2022646	2023907	And we will be right back.
2023947	2025609	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
2025629	2026810	You're listening to Trainwreck Radio.
2026950	2027550	Our apologies.
2027570	2029312	We're going to start this off with Graduation.
2029392	2032614	After that, Sync for Extreme and Tears will wrap up the set.
2032735	2033815	Remember, we love dead bunnies.
2171663	2172305	Thanks for watching!
2274405	2275513	Thank you for watching!
2344882	2346123	Orange Lounge Radio.
2346463	2348605	We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.
2350155	2358940	Um, is that a ferret in your pocket or are you just excited about the show?
2360981	2363923	It's actually a baby coyote in my pocket.
2365804	2366304	Whatever.
2366625	2367285	Don't mind me for a second.
2367305	2371847	You guys have to fill while I get the tape queued up here.
2373068	2377090	On the next episode of Dragon Ball Z, Goku gets a real gun shoved up his ass and he lives.
2377551	2377931	Wow!
2379059	2383380	Then he goes like super duper saiyan level 28 and kills people.
2383400	2386141	You know what I don't understand is why they didn't bury the bunny with a pancake on its head.
2387601	2388381	That would have been fun.
2389721	2391402	Yeah, but they didn't put a pancake on its head.
2392162	2393622	He had an orange on his belly.
2394582	2394902	So?
2395022	2396123	Not a pancake on its head.
2396183	2397563	It's famous for things on its head.
2398443	2399143	Not its belly.
2399483	2400924	He has dirt on his head.
2402104	2406885	He's balancing dirt and pushing up the daisies while he's at it.
2407403	2408144	Well, good for him.
2408524	2409645	I was a cute bunny, though.
2409685	2410465	I had a sniffle.
2411666	2415189	See, now you see how mean you all were while I was trying to read those haikus?
2415289	2417871	But it was hilarious, all those random pictures.
2418291	2420113	Those random pictures were pretty funny on that site.
2420593	2425017	Dear Dead Bunny Thing, we miss you terribly and hate that you are dead.
2425497	2431602	Um, Ulan died, but apparently came back to life in Animal Crossing, because your new guy Coco or whatever looks like a dead bunny.
2432663	2434364	Did somebody leave for Coco to show up?
2434404	2434784	Who left?
2435245	2435585	Maddie.
2437498	2438539	Maddie laughed.
2438599	2439499	That makes me cry.
2440260	2443081	I still think that we should make the Animal Crossing webcomic.
2443901	2451045	Um, FYI, I tried one of those ecstasy cigarette things, and I don't feel at all the least bit, like, aroused.
2451886	2453206	I just have halitosis now.
2453467	2454527	I'm glad I can't spell it.
2454567	2456908	Well, let one of us jerk you off, then you'll feel aroused.
2458149	2460010	No, in fact, I feel like I gotta take a fat piss.
2460911	2463432	If anything comes out along with it, then I'll let you guys know.
2466158	2470780	For the love of God!
2470840	2472741	And all that is holy!
2473361	2473741	Eat them!
2474342	2476003	You could probably eat them though, safely.
2476883	2477843	Yeah, except for the filter.
2478284	2481565	You could open the filter and make tea out of them.
2481645	2486868	No, SoCalKicks, I did not just volunteer to do that favor for Brad, he has a girlfriend.
2487949	2488569	Oh, stop it!
2488589	2488889	Stop it!
2492121	2494683	I think now's a good time, because we've got a lot of people tuned in.
2495083	2495804	They want to hear this.
2495864	2497284	This is the Fremont coverage.
2497304	2498725	This is where all of us were at yesterday.
2498745	2499446	Let go of that!
2501187	2501787	Oh my lord.
2501907	2502988	How does it feel to want?
2505600	2505860	All right.
2505940	2508942	You can want one hand and shit in the other and see which one fills up first.
2509202	2511224	Okay, here we go with the Fremont Tournament coverage.
2511244	2512885	This is going to get very crazy, you guys.
2512925	2513525	I just warn you.
2514105	2515366	We'll butt in with our comments.
2515386	2518108	I'm going to leave the mics hot, so we might be butting in and out with our comments.
2518148	2518688	So here we go.
2518708	2520690	Goddamn, burn my hand.
2520750	2523531	This is us yesterday.
2523552	2529675	That's just horribly wrong.
2529695	2530776	Yesterday at Fremont.
2530796	2531437	That's horribly wrong.
2531497	2532257	I hate this show.
2533258	2533818	I touched it.
2533838	2535099	Hi, I have a microphone.
2536900	2538341	Tell them where we're at, sweetie.
2538441	2538881	Hell!
2540222	2541423	We're at Chuck E. Cheese's.
2541704	2543405	I mean, Puntide Pizza.
2543785	2547608	O-M-G-W-C-S I'm eating nuts.
2551991	2553112	Okay, this is really random.
2553352	2557455	Okay, for real, this is Orange Sounds Radio live on, um, what's today?
2558476	2558876	I don't know.
2559236	2559676	The 11th!
2559757	2560057	The 11th.
2560077	2560097	1-11.
2560117	2560137	1-11.
2560157	2560237	1-1-1-0-3
2567297	2570499	And we're here for Fremont 2 tourney.
2571319	2574941	And Rob kicked ass on accident.
2576042	2577323	I wasn't even supposed to be here today.
2577783	2578823	He traded places with me.
2580224	2581225	And I'm eating nuts.
2581685	2582045	Nuts.
2583786	2586428	And I'm not saying anything and standing back here in the corner right here.
2587568	2589669	Let's let everybody assembled out here say hello.
2589909	2590630	Hello everybody!
2594267	2594687	What's up?
2594727	2596628	Let's talk to Virtue over here.
2596668	2597088	How you doing?
2597428	2597948	I lost.
2598308	2598908	You lost?
2598928	2599588	What happened, bud?
2600069	2600889	You took my power.
2601429	2601889	I'm sorry.
2601929	2602569	It was the shirt.
2602609	2603209	I swear to God.
2603609	2604910	I hate myself and I want to die.
2606350	2607630	I'll give you the shirt off my back.
2607810	2608291	No, I'm just kidding.
2608331	2608611	I won't.
2608631	2609591	I don't walk around naked.
2609651	2610231	It's a sight to see.
2610371	2611111	You got a cooler shirt.
2611131	2611992	You got Panic Ink.
2612732	2614032	What exactly is Panic Ink?
2614072	2618073	Panic Ink is quality software for your Apple microcomputer.
2618293	2619333	Is that like the Oregon Trail?
2619773	2620794	Yeah, something like that.
2621274	2621454	Damn!
2623032	2623913	What's up?
2624133	2624773	Who's this over here?
2624813	2625214	What's your name?
2625714	2626014	Atmo.
2626474	2626835	I'm sorry?
2627075	2627375	Atmo.
2627815	2628456	Hey, how you doing?
2628756	2629316	I'm doing good.
2629376	2630497	What brings you to Fremont today?
2630918	2631198	Me.
2631818	2632158	Cory.
2632218	2633319	I love Cory so much.
2633359	2636161	I'm going to bow down and kiss his shoes after he's done, but, you know.
2636762	2637742	You're a Cory fanboy?
2638062	2638843	Yes, I am.
2639023	2641865	Did you go, oh my gods, it's the Max 300 King?
2642706	2645287	Yes, I said, oh my god, it's the Max 300 King.
2646228	2648910	Anything you want to say to our lovely listeners out there on the radio?
2651147	2652288	Corey actually really sucks.
2652348	2654630	I just pretend like he's really cool so that he'll like me.
2655491	2656572	Secrets revealed.
2657152	2658493	Don't worry, everybody does that.
2658933	2659694	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
2660215	2660955	Corey's going to beat me up.
2661576	2662737	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2663697	2667581	I want to say hello to one of my favorite guests to have on any radio program ever.
2668481	2669542	Give it up, ladies and gentlemen.
2669923	2670363	It's Jahi.
2671284	2672045	I love this guy.
2672085	2674347	He always puts me on the microphone, especially when I'm drunk.
2674407	2675208	It's really great.
2675228	2675728	How you doing?
2675748	2676329	How you doing, Ski?
2676529	2677590	What have you had to drink today?
2677910	2681393	I'm actually completely sober, and I gave up pot smoking as a New Year's resolution.
2681413	2682194	What the hell happened?
2682915	2683595	That's not right.
2683936	2685917	I didn't say I gave up drinking or eating pot.
2685937	2687399	I just said I gave up smoking it.
2687459	2689020	So having it in the brownies is okay.
2689160	2690622	Yes, brownies are your friend.
2690642	2691142	Brownies are your friend.
2691162	2692083	Small interruption on Jockey.
2692223	2693244	www.mythought.com
2695676	2704662	www.whatthehelliswrongwithyou.com www.youdidntpayforthat.com Alright, I'll let Jamie talk to some folks over here.
2706444	2707424	I have a microphone.
2709926	2712848	Anyway, first interview that I do.
2712868	2714569	Say your name for our listeners.
2715410	2716230	I'm Hypergirl.
2717011	2717671	And you sure are.
2718552	2721754	So what have you been doing here at the thing all day with that bit of leather?
2722917	2728180	Oh, well, last year at Fremont 1, I had worn a leather vest for routine, so this year I'm continuing the tradition.
2729020	2732081	I'm referring to the leather that you've been wrapping around all the guys here.
2732822	2733842	Oh, that's the leather whip.
2734783	2736944	That's just randomly wrapping it around people.
2738484	2740725	So how many victims have you claimed today?
2741165	2741946	Well, let's see.
2743248	2753210	There was Corey, Nakari, Nado, um... I think there were a couple others, but I can't remember right now.
2753590	2755931	And plus I've threatened a whole lot of other people with it.
2757051	2759652	So are you competing in freestyle today?
2760192	2760472	I am.
2761212	2761592	Very cool.
2761612	2762112	Best of luck.
2762132	2762832	Thank you.
2762992	2765233	Do you have any special words for our listeners?
2767033	2769794	Um, I'm turning 18 in a month and a half.
2770518	2773219	So I will thus lose my jailbait status by summer.
2773239	2774659	You should be able to legally buy porn.
2775379	2776320	I don't have a gang bang.
2776340	2780721	Or legally be in porn.
2781101	2782121	Don't give her ideas.
2783121	2786362	It'll basically make my routines legal to watch.
2788943	2790483	And download on the internet.
2791303	2792644	I did that before with 18.
2795185	2796805	You heard it here first on Orange Lounge.
2798280	2801963	I'm sorry, did anyone else just hear Jahi in the background scream, no means no?
2802824	2803144	Yeah.
2803344	2804365	I fucking love Jahi.
2804465	2805126	I love that man.
2805186	2805446	Alright.
2808769	2811491	We're watching Rob get his ass beaten with a whip.
2813653	2814674	Thank you, sir, may I have another?
2814694	2818137	This is when Violent Hypergirl was beating me up with her whip.
2818177	2818537	It was cool.
2821666	2823208	Ah, I see why all the boys like her.
2824709	2829172	At this point, I was sitting inside playing GameCube, and I was distracted by that.
2829672	2830753	All of a sudden, I see Aaron.
2830833	2832835	Did you like the image of me getting beat up?
2833315	2841681	No, I was horribly, horribly scarred by it, because I look out the window and see Aaron with her whip, and see you sticking your ass out waiting for it.
2842462	2843423	Hey, could have been worse.
2843463	2845744	Could have been my bare ass, okay?
2846085	2846525	Twitch.
2848487	2848927	Moving on.
2849321	2850022	What's interviewing you?
2850783	2852104	Hi guys, I'm DCB.
2852985	2854046	And what makes you special?
2854967	2857370	I'm running the tournament, or at least I was.
2857570	2859051	You're also being pelted with nuts.
2859712	2860593	It's raining nuts.
2861294	2861694	Hallelujah.
2861714	2864377	Stop throwing nuts in my head!
2867080	2869382	Hi, so how's the tournament been so far?
2869823	2870784	It's been hectic.
2871661	2874502	because the wrong directions were given out to very many people.
2875122	2877483	And so that's probably why there's not a lot of people here today.
2878104	2879504	Stay tuned for the FUs of the week.
2879524	2880545	We'll be getting into that later.
2882105	2886087	Yeah, a fuck you goes to MapQuest, indeed.
2887288	2892570	By the way, tournament running is not as much fun as it looks, is it?
2893750	2895771	I thought it would be fun, but it's hectic.
2895991	2896732	It's crazy.
2897532	2897932	It's hell.
2898652	2900093	But do you think it's all worth it?
2901044	2904568	In the end, yeah.
2904688	2909813	So, do you have anything special to say for our listeners?
2910433	2911054	Hi, guys.
2912515	2913316	Hi, Dad.
2913757	2914658	I'm in jail.
2915178	2915959	I like it here.
2917861	2918241	All right.
2921505	2926488	I have another interview here with the one, the only, the infamous, say hello to Kyle Snyder, ladies and gentlemen.
2926768	2927189	Hello.
2927649	2928309	How you doing today?
2928590	2929570	I'm doing alright.
2930111	2931972	What brings you to Fremont, sir?
2932792	2934594	This is my hometown.
2934694	2941218	I'm competing in this tournament to show my greatest, one of my greatest routines ever.
2941618	2945741	I can't say it's my greatest because Flushing Tonight is my greatest.
2947855	2949176	What should we expect from your routine today?
2949196	2949936	Is it a big secret?
2950117	2952318	Can you give us any details before you go?
2953900	2954740	One word.
2955541	2956342	Shades.
2957423	2958063	Shades.
2958543	2959144	Cryptic!
2960585	2961786	Gets a reaction from the crowd.
2962607	2966450	Kyle, is there anything you want to say to the listeners of Orange Lines Radio, Bomani Internet Radio?
2967185	2968146	I sure would.
2968446	2975752	To all those that are freestyling, you are about to see a routine that you possibly have never seen before.
2976313	2982598	It is a Michael Jackson routine, and I guarantee you, you are in for a show.
2984079	2985781	I am moist with anticipation.
2985821	2986661	How about everybody else?
2988903	2989824	Good luck out there, Kyle.
2990124	2991646	All right, I'll see you soon.
2991746	2993107	You got many fans out there rooting for you.
2993127	2993427	Good luck.
2994208	2994508	All right.
2996128	2996953	That'd be a pretty cool name.
2997436	2998301	Alright, we're gonna...
2999525	3000966	We're going to talk to these guys.
3001006	3002847	You want to talk to these guys, Jamie, or you want me to talk to these guys?
3003427	3003687	Alright.
3003907	3005248	Who is this guy over here in the green?
3005828	3008869	Okay, first of all, my name is Alex, a.k.a.
3009010	3010590	La Saca Puntas for this tournament.
3011311	3014172	And for all you people that don't speak Spanish, that is the pencil sharpener.
3014232	3015573	Yes, that's right, I said pencil sharpener.
3015593	3016573	I thought punta was whore.
3016993	3018674	No, that's Saca Puntas.
3018694	3019054	Oh, my bad.
3019234	3021175	Yeah, so it's like the whole other word before it.
3021235	3022216	Yes, I know, I took Spanish.
3022236	3023276	So you're not a whore sharpener?
3023436	3024497	No, I'm not a whore sharpener.
3024517	3024877	I'm sorry.
3025257	3026458	Though I do support it, no.
3028946	3030647	Anything you want to say about tourney today?
3031608	3031908	I don't know.
3031968	3034690	Actually, this is my first time, so I don't know.
3034750	3035111	Virgin.
3035391	3036091	Virgin, yes.
3036752	3037212	That's right.
3039674	3040014	I don't know.
3040375	3044017	I was actually convinced into doing this, so this is my cultural freestyle.
3045018	3045959	Best of luck to you.
3046019	3046499	Good to meet you.
3046579	3046900	Thank you.
3046940	3047180	You too.
3048178	3051021	And this is one of the co-runners of the tournament here.
3051061	3051781	What's your name, sir?
3052182	3053283	Pete, aka Henry.
3054023	3059849	Alright, and what made you decide to do a tourney here at the lovely, where the hell are we, Funtime Pizza?
3061090	3062971	I decided to make some money.
3063192	3063532	I don't know.
3064252	3065774	Do you actually make money off a tournament?
3065794	3067095	That's unheard of for me.
3067655	3068316	Not much, no.
3068756	3069217	But it's fun.
3070255	3072896	Anything in particular you're really looking forward to seeing today?
3073316	3073876	Kyle Snyder.
3074177	3074817	Kyle Snyder.
3074837	3076417	It's the reason why we do this, right?
3076717	3076958	Yes.
3077098	3077518	Oh, my God.
3077558	3078038	Must see him.
3078698	3079298	He's my hero.
3080399	3080959	Must see.
3081299	3083200	Must see DDR, ladies and gentlemen.
3083220	3083520	All right.
3084660	3086921	I had to ask one more question to DCB while I got him.
3087521	3089402	What's up with the Kirk Cameron in the milk thing?
3090548	3098311	Uh, Chaos, John, he ripped it out of his cooking textbook, and, I don't know, he just said, hi guys, and stuck it in my face, and it's kind of caught on ever since.
3099631	3101212	Wait a minute, a cooking textbook?
3101232	3102312	Does that mean he's in Home Ec?
3104313	3105173	A guy in Home Ec?
3107034	3111877	I took home ec in seventh grade and I got an A plus in it because I can cook without burning things.
3112937	3115399	I took home ec in seventh grade and I failed.
3115519	3116679	Wait, no, I gotta see.
3117279	3117560	Yeah.
3118240	3119801	Macaroni's not very hard to make, guys.
3119841	3120681	Bunch of fags.
3120801	3122602	Okay, I'm a girl and I never took home ec.
3122682	3123603	I can just cook anyway.
3123743	3125024	You took woodshop, didn't you?
3125144	3126785	Wait, no, we didn't even make macaroni.
3127045	3127865	That's too complicated.
3128445	3131407	I was in the gifted program and I got to take whatever the fuck I wanted.
3132628	3135771	Wait, no, we didn't make macaroni, that was too complicated.
3136191	3142376	We made the little, like, biscuits where you, like, open up the little can, and then you just kind of put them onto the pan.
3142876	3143657	They made Spam.
3144297	3146719	No, I'm sorry, maybe the school was a little bit too cheap for Spam.
3146739	3147259	You made Treat?
3150422	3152283	My home ec class, I actually cooked things.
3153224	3155786	I mean, we actually made pancakes from scratch.
3156727	3158728	And I was the only one that could cook them without burning them.
3158949	3161531	DCB's telling me that home ec is the cool thing to do at their school.
3162744	3165770	How, I mean, are all the chicks in there loose or something?
3165810	3167814	At my school, I just liked it because I got to eat food.
3168134	3169517	And they gave this Kool-Aid to me.
3171561	3172463	I like to eat food.
3173104	3173885	I like food!
3176451	3177712	Better than eating feces.
3178693	3181335	That's funny because I took it because I don't like to eat food.
3181395	3186480	You know, I just... Okay, EOSFVB just summed up high school in one sentence.
3187200	3191224	Fuck, I thought high school was going to be like Saved by the Bell, but I was wrong and disappointed.
3192024	3194326	Okay, you want to hear what I learned in high school?
3194787	3199811	I learned how to either annoy or avoid people and that a mole is 6.02 times 10 to the negative 23rd power.
3201795	3203016	I'm so excited!
3203376	3204537	I'm so excited!
3205018	3206419	I'm so scared!
3211023	3211463	Never mind.
3211924	3212804	Back to the effective tape.
3213325	3216568	We'll let DCB finish the story, though.
3217308	3219250	You can't stop time and talk to the camera?
3219350	3220091	No, unfortunately not.
3220491	3221692	Back to the story, back to the story.
3223072	3225453	That's the joke, if y'all were wondering about inside jokes.
3225773	3228854	Yeah, it's all over my banner, all over my website.
3229395	3230355	It's about to die soon, though.
3230375	3232076	We need a new mascot for Hi Guys.
3232576	3233316	He's so dreamy.
3233996	3234617	Oh, hell yeah.
3236417	3236758	Right on.
3237198	3239038	Oh, I didn't ask if there was anything else you wanted to say.
3239078	3240899	Any other shoutouts you wanted to give today?
3242220	3242560	What's up?
3244000	3247662	I want to give a shoutout to all my AZN peeps all around the world.
3248442	3249323	Peace out, foe.
3250303	3251704	I was waiting for the acronyms.
3251764	3252684	I've been waiting all day.
3254409	3255030	Vertu's back.
3255110	3255451	What's up?
3256091	3256352	Hi.
3256572	3257513	Are you going to be doing freestyle?
3258775	3259536	Unfortunately not.
3259756	3260518	Why not?
3261439	3261919	I'm white.
3262280	3262821	Oh, I forgot.
3262841	3264603	They're not going to spin you on your head again?
3266466	3267828	I don't have my spinners.
3269670	3270932	I know, and who's this that just joined us?
3271584	3272924	Chaos, what's up?
3273605	3276325	I'm just trying to remember what the hell Jahi was screaming about in the background.
3277146	3278246	You just randomly hear him.
3278706	3284948	I know, I threatened to quit this show and just let Jahi take over, and I think all three of us were in agreement that Jahi just needs to do this show.
3285488	3287608	We need to give him his own show on the Orange Lounge Network.
3287708	3288589	Do you think he'd agree to that?
3288869	3289629	The Jahi Hour?
3289729	3291369	Wait, the Jahi stuff's coming up next.
3291389	3292330	We're not even there yet.
3292370	3293190	We're not even there yet.
3293610	3293970	Here we go.
3293990	3296251	Chaos, how you doing?
3296451	3296831	I'm good.
3296871	3297371	Hi, guys.
3298228	3299309	Good show and imperfect attack.
3299329	3299889	Very nice job.
3300450	3300850	Thank you.
3301210	3302391	I had to go through you, though.
3302991	3303552	That's all right.
3304492	3307494	I don't know how the hell... I got off the machine and said, I'm not even supposed to be here today.
3307514	3308215	What the hell is going on?
3309216	3309936	DOC prize.
3309956	3310396	Yeah, right.
3311017	3313158	Explain the horsey you've got here.
3313539	3314379	It has a push button.
3314739	3317121	It's not just your average horse toy.
3318202	3320543	It's a sex toy for both boys and girls, you see.
3322124	3325707	Because its beautiful face gives great head.
3327630	3329672	And then I see you're caressing that face right now.
3329912	3330612	Yes, yes.
3331153	3332894	Me and Eve have a lot of fun.
3334115	3336857	And then if you flip a... Eve is in Summer's Eve.
3337358	3337758	Over.
3338459	3339479	That's the girl's side.
3341141	3343703	This is just like the Harry Potter broomstick that vibrates.
3345944	3351449	Yeah, those are banned in Australia because 12-year-old girls are riding them for more than an hour.
3353070	3354231	You must be this tall to ride.
3355126	3357406	Yeah, does that rule apply to Eve?
3359767	3360947	I guess stand up and then give me head.
3363187	3364088	Fair enough, alright.
3366388	3367788	I think that's better than the ferret.
3368008	3369809	I think we've got some competition for the ferret here.
3370069	3370749	Where'd Jamie go?
3371549	3372009	Damn.
3372849	3374229	Oh, she's up to no good.
3375409	3377330	I think Step Swap's going to go cause some havoc.
3378710	3380490	Oh my god, it's Initial D live!
3382851	3384231	It's Initial D live!
3385489	3390114	The reason why I'm yelling this... What are you guys laughing about right now?
3390654	3394999	I've decided that at the next convention, on a big convention I guess, I'm going to cosplay as Oolong.
3396673	3397914	I'm doing that in front of me, man.
3398094	3399394	Back to Fremont, hello.
3399734	3400735	Back to the topic at hand.
3401055	3406937	The reason why I'm yelling initial D live, you had all a step squad walking out towards the cars, the racetrack.
3407277	3409298	I didn't know that they were actually going over there to take a group picture.
3409318	3411339	I thought they were actually all going to get in little go-karts and race.
3411359	3413339	So I was like, initial D live!
3414240	3419762	I thought you were talking, oh, what about like the one that drove by in the big car with the hole in the muffler?
3420002	3422263	Then we go, oh my god, your cock's so big!
3423018	3425599	God, I hate guys with big cars.
3425680	3426720	Anyway, moving on.
3426800	3427120	Interviews.
3431323	3432763	Olive Step Squad hates me right now.
3432804	3433244	It's all good.
3433524	3434685	All right, I'll be back later.
3436446	3442089	All right, this is the portion of the show where we just give the microphone to Jahi and watch what happens.
3443089	3443570	Oh, God.
3444410	3445891	They keep doing this.
3446471	3447552	I don't know why.
3447752	3449553	So now I'm walking around and I have a mic.
3450558	3453100	I think Skid just really doesn't give a rat's ass at this point.
3453160	3454861	He's just letting me go.
3455582	3456343	He's just letting me go.
3458024	3460106	I'm like the man on the street host.
3460286	3460646	I don't know.
3461687	3465209	Alright, so right now I'm walking around the front of Game Zone in Fremont.
3465230	3466631	This is my old stomping grounds right here.
3467391	3468752	Good shot to my friend Walter Williams.
3468772	3469673	We used to walk here all the time.
3469693	3470333	It's a nice arcade.
3470353	3472075	And we're here with Natto.
3472970	3473691	Nado, how's it going, man?
3473831	3474471	Yeah, pretty good, man.
3474491	3474851	How's it going?
3475172	3475692	Cool, cool.
3475812	3477133	Yeah, so you're here with ViolentHyper, girl.
3477413	3478794	Yes, I am, yeah.
3479074	3481116	I'm assuming you're, like, happy today because she hasn't whipped you.
3481536	3481876	Oh, yeah.
3482077	3482517	Oh, yeah.
3482997	3487360	Like, I'm very fortunate that she hasn't whipped me yet, but she's, like, kicking the crap out of me right now.
3487380	3490763	VHG being the SSAer she is, she's kicking the shit out of Nado right now.
3490863	3492324	They're probably going to have to edit that out on the show.
3492684	3493925	I got tons of people out here.
3496026	3496687	Con's here.
3496707	3500710	DCB's over here with his Kirk Cameron photo, which has traumatized me a lot.
3501977	3511104	Oh God, it's the man, the myth, the legend, the RTF representer, No Skizzle, Mike No, how's it going dog?
3511584	3515788	No's coughing right now, he just smoked a Tentac, he's, okay, how's it going man?
3517469	3520771	He's drinking Aquafina, he's about to say a few words.
3522793	3525335	As most of you guys should know, today is my birthday.
3528576	3533658	To start, I no longer want to be addressed as Asian Innovation for today.
3535499	3539540	I want you all to call me the Big Party.
3540521	3541441	I've got my groove on.
3541881	3542542	You should too.
3543762	3544983	Uh-oh.
3545143	3546803	I think Mike had a fun birthday.
3547504	3549524	The video should be on the internet in a few days.
3550925	3552606	All right, we're going to get run over, so I'm going to move.
3552766	3555867	Fuzzy's drunk ass is driving to here with Iori, so I'm about to interview them in a minute.
3557085	3558047	How are you two gentlemen today?
3558367	3558788	I'm alright.
3558848	3559909	Are you competing in the tournament today?
3560030	3560510	Yes, I am.
3560550	3560991	Great, great.
3561171	3561532	What's your name?
3562073	3563174	Robbie.
3563435	3565017	Pete, I'm the one that's running the tournament.
3565197	3569925	Okay, so Pete's one of the staffers here that I haven't met yet, and he has, what was the guy's name, Bubbles?
3570876	3572457	I believe from the Strong Bad side.
3572477	3573697	Go to HomestarRunner.com.
3573737	3574217	They own you.
3574737	3576498	So what are you going to be doing with the guitar here today?
3576758	3579059	I'm going to be playing Lawn Train to Run in my freshman year's freestyle.
3579459	3580239	Wow.
3580439	3582480	Okay, so we actually have somebody here with guitar skills.
3582500	3584220	So we're not going to hear Stairway to Heaven, right?
3584860	3585201	Correct.
3585521	3585881	Thank you.
3586101	3586761	Thank you, God.
3586881	3588121	So how's the tournament been running today?
3588321	3588642	It's good.
3589822	3591402	Yeah, at first, no, it was not good.
3591422	3593843	There's like five people showed up, but then, yeah, everyone showed up.
3594323	3594483	Cool.
3594503	3595864	So how many people do you think you have here today?
3597104	3597544	Maybe like 80.
3597744	3597804	Wow. 80?
3600208	3601548	No, no, I don't know.
3601768	3604549	We'll find out later if that's... How many tournaments have you run?
3604829	3605490	This is my first one.
3605510	3606010	Okay.
3606430	3611311	Is this the... From the tournaments that you've been to in DDR, is this like the average turnout for a tournament of about 80, 100 people?
3611511	3611932	Yes, it is.
3612652	3613672	Good turnout for the most part?
3613852	3614032	Yeah.
3614592	3616973	Everybody makes their money back and... Yeah, everything's good.
3617333	3617553	Okay.
3617853	3620034	He looks like he's scared as hell because I have a microphone right here.
3620054	3620854	Don't worry, it's Orange Lounge.
3620874	3621995	Everybody's half drunk anyway.
3622015	3623855	Orange Lounge owns you.
3623895	3624535	Go to that website.
3624555	3625616	Okay, we got another person over here.
3625636	3626116	This is...
3627066	3627927	I so can't read that.
3627967	3628467	That's chaos.
3628527	3629228	Okay, how's it going, man?
3629248	3629888	What's up, man?
3630168	3631089	How are you doing today?
3631269	3631830	I'm pretty good.
3632090	3632930	Did you already compete today?
3633071	3634412	Yep, I got third place in PA.
3634732	3635793	Wow, third place in PA.
3635833	3638274	And he's getting... He beat me at PA, Sniff.
3638755	3640256	That's okay, I wasn't even supposed to be there anyway.
3640436	3641237	Hey, you beat Ree.
3643798	3644959	Miracles happen, I don't know.
3646540	3653606	I just remember everyone I talked to was like, oh yeah, it's going to be this, this, and this, and as always the top three they always name, but you top three.
3654705	3655146	I don't know.
3655306	3658011	I woke up on the right side of bed, I guess.
3658872	3659753	People really do win.
3660835	3661636	I are a wiener.
3662097	3663419	Oh, we have a new guest coming in.
3664521	3665122	Say hello.
3666164	3666664	Where is he?
3667866	3668868	Get his butt back here.
3670632	3671873	Oh, I'm scared.
3672993	3674014	Oh, he's got a tape with him.
3674054	3674814	Say hello, everybody.
3674854	3676455	This is explicit.
3676915	3677996	Hey, what's up, everybody?
3678016	3679097	How you doing?
3679117	3681058	We're listening to the Fremont interviews right now.
3681078	3683659	Is this a shaft tape that you got with you?
3684359	3685300	I have the shaft tape.
3685540	3686721	I know this is the MGL tape.
3686761	3690183	I was supposed to bring it a long time ago, but I was able to go due to some reasons.
3690763	3693584	I wish we had something to watch that on right now.
3693705	3694345	Oh, shit.
3694745	3695245	All right, anyway.
3696526	3699588	Let's let Jahi finish the Orange Lounge interviews right here.
3699688	3699928	Let's go.
3701413	3703755	How much money is he earning for third place?
3704195	3705216	Third place is $30.
3706337	3708538	Hey, $30, that's worth like... It will grow.
3708978	3713962	See, you know, that's like a PlayStation game, that's a meal at TGI Fridays, that's alcohol at TGI Fridays, that's great.
3714402	3715383	So how'd you feel about tournament today?
3715403	3716964	Did you feel competition was stiff for the most part?
3717344	3718325	Uh, yep, really.
3718525	3721627	Because of Emphasis and, of course, Tigger.
3722307	3723728	I still fear Emphasis and Tigger.
3723768	3728892	I'm like, you know, like a newbie when it comes to the whole PA thing, so... Corey's stealing his money, so...
3729853	3732256	But yeah, so how did you feel about third place?
3732276	3733978	What song did you play as your last song when you competed?
3734618	3736781	Uh, we played... What did we play?
3737541	3739584	We played Kakame, um, Heavy.
3740004	3745690	Oh, for the listeners out there, this tournament did take place on a DDR7 mix, so Kakame is just nasty anyway.
3746791	3747092	Cock.
3749534	3752375	DarkSakura jumped in because she heard something about a cock and she jumped up.
3753355	3754035	I did not.
3754195	3755616	Why not have a cock?
3755956	3756656	We got nuts.
3756696	3757256	We got balls.
3757276	3757796	We got cock.
3757836	3759477	It's a regular gay porno out here.
3759997	3762298	I think I see Ken Stryker walking in right now.
3762418	3766319	And Hanza just ran out when he heard about the nuts.
3766679	3768079	FYI, it's Jeff Stryker.
3768299	3769319	Not that I know these things.
3769480	3770020	Balls and cock.
3770040	3770680	How you doing, Hanza?
3772040	3773121	Oh, hey now, hey now.
3773201	3774281	I don't be getting down like that.
3774301	3775321	I'm going to leave that up for you.
3775381	3777802	But hey, I'm not down with the whole nuts and cock thing.
3777822	3778122	I'm not...
3778971	3779551	I don't swim.
3779912	3784674	Well, it's, you know, I'd rather be down with that than be down with what R. Kelly was down with, though.
3785115	3786215	You're right, that is all bad.
3786235	3789537	That whole, that whole, like, yellow shower thing, that's all.
3789757	3790778	No, no.
3790838	3792319	Anybody here like the yellow shower thing?
3793339	3794320	No.
3794340	3794700	Exactly.
3794900	3796161	Scott wanted to play a song.
3796181	3797902	We're going to let Scott play a song.
3797922	3798642	Scott, what do you got?
3799583	3801864	All right, I'll go play Long Chain of Running from 7th Mix.
3802024	3802364	All righty.
3802845	3803325	Let's do it.
3803525	3803585	Go.
3803605	3803665	Go.
3808124	3814007	Eric Clapton in the house.
3819730	3820491	Clap, damn it!
3822952	3824013	I clap with one right.
3824233	3826154	When Jahi says clap, you fucking clap.
3829336	3830677	So Scott is a threader.
3830697	3831897	He actually has skill with this thing.
3831917	3832278	He's not like...
3833425	3849094	Robin, as, I don't know why I called him that, I know too many people, Robin has actual skill with this thing, what are some of your other, I'll be Robin, Robin, Scott, okay, it's Robbie, is it Robbie, it's freaking Robbie, okay Robbie, what are some of your other favorite songs to play?
3849495	3856779	Oh, some of my other favorite songs, I like playing House of the Rising Sun, Put Your Lights On by Santana,
3857463	3859505	and then anything by the Beatles or Aerosmith.
3859785	3860706	Well, he has good taste.
3861387	3862188	He didn't say Eminem.
3862208	3862608	That's good.
3862828	3863289	That's good.
3863309	3866692	Okay, I was going to interview Fuzzy and Iori, but they just walked off.
3866712	3868414	But I'm going to interview the dancer back here.
3869155	3869635	What's your name, man?
3869915	3871477	My name is Alex, a.k.a.
3871517	3872358	Las Acapuntas.
3873019	3874080	Las Acapuntas.
3875353	3877336	For the bilingually impaired, that's the pencil sharpener.
3877577	3877917	Wow.
3877997	3878498	Where are you from?
3878939	3880802	I'm from... Mexico?
3881082	3881443	No, I'm not.
3881483	3882625	I'm from San Francisco.
3882825	3883066	Cool.
3883146	3884468	Wow, you have a long trip coming out here.
3884488	3885790	We're in Fremont, California today.
3885950	3886491	I know we are.
3886651	3888154	That's exactly right.
3888214	3888675	Good job.
3888835	3889917	What part of San Francisco are you from?
3890795	3891716	I don't live there.
3892076	3892797	I was from there.
3892977	3894278	I was born and conceived there.
3894539	3895499	Okay, where do you live now?
3895960	3896801	I live in Newark.
3897181	3899223	Okay, so he's right down the street practically here.
3899263	3900184	I'm right down the street.
3900864	3901345	That's cool.
3901585	3902666	This is like my old stomping grounds.
3902686	3903286	Do you like it here?
3903607	3904267	Oh, yeah.
3904347	3907350	This is very gravy, I believe is the terminology.
3908051	3910353	You like being able to walk home at night and not get stabbed and stuff?
3910373	3911454	Oh, yes, I do.
3911534	3912014	Yes, I do.
3912535	3914577	Or not get held at gunpoint for my gay porn.
3914617	3914997	I mean, wait.
3916778	3918459	Alex is a busy, busy man.
3918539	3920180	So, did you compete today or are you waiting to compete?
3920200	3920941	I'm waiting to compete.
3920981	3923482	I'm going to be doing my cultural freestyle to La Señorita.
3924062	3924703	I couldn't believe it.
3924823	3926104	I said that as wide as I possibly could.
3926544	3929446	Now, just so I don't have a bunch of people who are pissed off, shoot me later.
3929706	3931327	Are you part Mexican or Latino?
3931367	3931907	Yes, I am.
3931967	3932407	I'm half.
3933368	3935009	I celebrate Cinco de Mayo until noon, then I'm done.
3935449	3936350	Oh, God.
3937063	3939365	Alright, so remember, this is Oxus Freestyle.
3939545	3943427	If you are mad at the cultural freestyle, if you see it on the internet, do not shoot me.
3943968	3945088	I did not endorse this.
3945569	3948731	I think DarkSakura wants the mic back, or because it's like a cock, I don't know.
3949491	3950332	Oh, baby, no.
3950972	3953013	It's, I believe, time for Freshness Freestyle.
3953234	3954935	Yay!
3955255	3960638	Time for Freshness Freestyle, where everybody can do knee drops and hand slaps.
3961219	3963220	Newbie Freshness, oh yeah!
3963600	3964681	Contributed by Self and Malt.
3965126	3966968	and you don't have to be Korean.
3967748	3968449	And Jollibee.
3969990	3971752	What the hell just happened here, Jamie?
3971852	3973493	We gave Jahe the microphone, enough said.
3973533	3974114	That was cool.
3976567	3977027	That's it.
3977407	3980129	That was the end of the Fremont coverage.
3980149	3981150	That was so beautiful.
3981310	3982430	I keep crying.
3982670	3983671	My apologies.
3984391	3988434	My big apologies to Chubbs and Maple.
3989034	3992056	Because I told them we'd interview them after.
3993436	3994637	And we never did.
3994777	3995898	So, my bad.
3995938	3996798	But we love you anyway.
3996818	3997959	Yeah, we love you guys anyway.
3998919	4001281	And that means you guys just have to come visit.
4001961	4004324	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4018882	4024403	So, we'll be able to actually talk some freestyle here on Orange Lounge, and then we're going to do your FUs of the week.
4024583	4026363	How to knee drop without bloodying your knee.
4026643	4031164	So, send your FUs over private message to moi, that's Skye.
4031204	4035065	I'm in the chat room, orangelounge.skie.cx, click on chat.
4035345	4036125	What are you talking about?
4036205	4037945	I know all the freestyle moves.
4038025	4039466	I can do the knee drop.
4039606	4040646	I'm sorry.
4040666	4041426	Baby suck.
4043466	4045947	You know why you can't freestyle?
4045987	4046487	Because you're white.
4047378	4048363	No, no, no, no, no.
4048404	4049268	Hey, I can read stuff.
4049289	4050194	It's all about the nut shop.
4051158	4051819	Wait, wait, wait.
4051939	4052459	Am I white?
4052739	4053520	Wait, what am I wearing?
4053560	4054040	What am I wearing?
4054060	4054721	The FUBU.
4055061	4056002	Yes, the FUBU.
4056042	4056822	Now, wait a minute.
4056942	4059765	A white girl tied for the winner yesterday at the competition.
4059985	4062066	Yeah, we have our first place winner.
4063327	4064949	The first place team was half white.
4065869	4066230	Yep.
4067110	4067350	Oh, yeah.
4067390	4067711	Oh, yeah.
4067731	4067991	All right.
4068011	4068771	Yeah, it was half white.
4068812	4069252	That's why.
4071674	4075497	It was actually one of the best routines I've seen in a very, very long time.
4076297	4077178	Well choreographed.
4080006	4086371	It was a good routine, yes, but the thing is, like 99% of the time, white guys don't freestyle at all.
4086551	4087272	Well, hey, come on.
4088453	4090474	Oh, I mean, give us some credit.
4091195	4092716	Dave over here can do the grapevine.
4092736	4094057	What are you talking about, Dave?
4094197	4095659	White guys don't freestyle.
4095679	4097140	Good, I mean, look at Kyle Snyder.
4098801	4099902	Can we go to break now, please?
4099922	4102444	We'll come back and we'll finish talking about freestyle.
4103005	4104005	So send me your FUs.
4104466	4107468	If you don't want to come in the chat room and do it, you can send us an email.
4107508	4108409	Jamie, give us that address.
4108932	4110093	Um, words, no.
4110454	4115459	It's, uh, Orange Lounge Radio at Yahoo.com.
4116300	4118182	Alrighty, so we'll be right back.
4119803	4120043	Sorry?
4120264	4121084	Oh, bitches.
4121445	4122125	They said, and then?
4122666	4122926	And then?
4122946	4123767	And then?
4123947	4124288	No, and then.
4124448	4125148	Okay.
4125169	4129473	We'll be right back after some more happy, fun MP3s from Xtreme.
4297568	4297756	Thank you.
4327187	4329007	Are you ready?
4329047	4331328	Here we go!
4331348	4332908	You are a super dancer!
4361050	4362133	What a great feeling!
4411662	4416323	I just want you to know You'll always be the one I love
4445325	4445845	Hi, guys.
4446066	4447767	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
4447847	4449668	I want to see Captain Jack cry.
4450048	4450669	We're back.
4451109	4453611	Mommy, sing me a fast trip machine.
4454451	4455612	Oh, my phone's going off.
4455932	4457273	I'll have to get back to that later.
4457293	4457914	That was my sister.
4460075	4465279	In that set, we heard Love, Trip Machine, and Memories.
4465339	4466680	It's a Politary song.
4466720	4467800	What the hell happened?
4467820	4469021	It is a Politary song.
4469061	4471543	However, it's a good Politary song where she can hold a key.
4472364	4472764	That's right.
4472804	4474125	You'll all come around eventually.
4475822	4476863	I've been listening to Paul Terry since way back.
4476883	4479966	Yeah, but she's not holding up on her head between her ears, okay?
4480306	4481207	Like that freaking bunny.
4481247	4482768	Is she balancing pancakes on her head?
4483128	4483769	She should be.
4486131	4486692	Okay, yeah.
4487552	4489894	So, what's up next, Rob?
4490535	4493638	I wanted to talk about freestyle, because we've got Explicit.
4493658	4494438	Let's talk to Explicit.
4494458	4496340	He's somebody who we haven't had on the show before.
4497181	4497821	There's a mic.
4498021	4498442	How you doing?
4498462	4499623	Hey, all right.
4499643	4500163	I'm doing all right.
4500203	4501364	You missed Fremont yesterday.
4501404	4501885	What gives?
4502692	4504033	Some family stuff to take care of.
4504213	4504993	Ah, family crap.
4505013	4506434	I know how that goes.
4506554	4510836	So, what do you think about freestyle today in the DDR world?
4511717	4512617	How's it going there?
4513278	4514498	I'm working on it very well.
4514658	4517320	I'm trying to get better and better and better as well.
4518080	4521642	As you all know, I used to be Explicit Alpha like last year and everything.
4521722	4524063	Now I'm the beta stage.
4524703	4525524	Gamma coming soon?
4526945	4527965	As the beta dies off.
4528205	4531307	Alpha just died off after MGL.
4533253	4534834	And later on we can call you Explicit Pie.
4535595	4537336	Oh my gosh.
4538437	4541359	And speaking of freestyle, I got routines already planned.
4542780	4543541	You like an extreme?
4544061	4545062	So far so good.
4545102	4547344	Very freestyle-able stuff in there?
4547564	4549105	Yeah, there's like a lot of good songs in there.
4549125	4552148	A lot of variation.
4552168	4553609	Sounds like We Will Rock You.
4554069	4556411	That's like one of the most hot picks.
4557031	4557632	Oh my gosh.
4561856	4564838	I'm waiting to see someone do a routine to bag.
4565198	4565599	I'm waiting.
4566479	4571342	You know, I would even be half-tempted to take the Cup of Life and bring out my Samba de Amiga maracas.
4572603	4575265	I'll do bag, I'll wear the kilt, commando style.
4576186	4576766	Come on, everybody.
4577166	4577827	You know you want it.
4579788	4582630	Then I can get the cock whipped out things, you know what I'm saying?
4584761	4585481	Dot, dot, dot.
4586262	4586682	Anyway.
4587642	4590303	Yeah, why is it that nobody whips their cock out at the end of a routine?
4590343	4591484	That's what I really want to know.
4591804	4593345	Why have any freestylers done that?
4593545	4595726	Just at the end, go, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
4596086	4596646	Yeah!
4596666	4597126	There it is.
4600107	4601628	Why hasn't anyone done that explicit?
4603009	4603549	It happens.
4603589	4606410	Well, people have planned routines, they do whatever they want.
4609632	4611833	I could say something very mean right now, but I'm not going to say it.
4611853	4612094	Say it.
4612174	4612494	No.
4612594	4613155	Say it.
4613475	4613915	I can't.
4613955	4614716	I'm going to get killed.
4615757	4616017	Fine.
4616497	4617318	Save it for next show.
4617618	4619880	Oh, okay.
4620801	4623383	What's the next big tourney you plan on competing in locally here?
4623423	4628568	Well, probably the one in Sacramento that's coming up in March because I've heard all about it.
4629620	4631061	and B3, which is in April.
4631662	4632643	Ah, it's going to be big.
4633003	4645813	Actually, from what I understand, it might be postponed until May, but the details are... Actually, I'm pretty sure that the confirmed dates are going to be the second weekend in May, which should be the 11th and 12th.
4647514	4650256	But I'm pretty sure that's a confirmed date now.
4651817	4666387	In case people are wondering, planned events should be a Beat Mania score competition, both freestyle and PA for DDR, and a Dance Maniacs tournament too.
4667188	4668489	Wow, Dance Maniacs, interesting.
4669338	4671239	I might actually compete in a Dance Maniacs tournament.
4671499	4673939	Dance Maniacs, actually, I can kind of dance to.
4674679	4676440	It's a shock, but anyway, I'm sorry.
4677720	4679661	So you'll be doing the B3 tournament, too, as well, huh?
4680141	4680621	Indeed.
4680661	4681621	Shaking your ass don't count.
4683042	4684002	Whatever, whatever.
4687103	4687983	Any shout-outs?
4688003	4688763	Any friends listening?
4688783	4690724	You might want to say hello to anything you want to say.
4690744	4693024	Well, the shout-outs to the visionaries.
4693524	4695465	I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the V-Month tournament.
4699264	4702105	Good shit.
4702345	4710007	It's the first tourney that I've actually... Well, I judged one small tourney at Sac State last year, but this is the first major tourney that I've gotten to judge.
4710027	4710967	It was interesting.
4711387	4712867	I like judging because they get a front row seat.
4714368	4714668	Indeed.
4716607	4717907	You were sitting on the ground in front of me.
4719288	4727790	Well, yeah, I had a front row seat that was closer than Rob, except my ass got sore, and I... Not that way!
4728350	4736112	My feet fell asleep, and I was in a really bad spot when I had to go get up and take a piss four times because I drank too much soda during the day.
4736972	4745114	I had a second row spot, and what was awesome is when I couldn't see anything behind certain people, I was sitting right next to the camera, so I just watched the viewfinder.
4745234	4746435	Perfect shot of the whole thing.
4747415	4748775	I had a backstage pass.
4749255	4750776	All of Stub Squad was hanging out outside.
4750796	4754337	So we were just sort of watching from the back of the machine, going, oh.
4754797	4757338	And there was, of course, a running commentary by a few people back there.
4757358	4760719	You know, that person has a good technique, but, you know, at random.
4762339	4762899	What do you think about that?
4762919	4764720	We were kind of talking a little bit about this during breaks.
4764740	4764980	Oh, yes, Loki.
4767210	4769273	All I gotta say is, Kakumei!
4770234	4771295	Kakumei!
4772056	4772897	Kakumei!
4772917	4774679	Oh my gosh.
4774919	4776401	Let the joke die.
4776521	4778003	Step away from the joke.
4779244	4781187	Hey, I just heard cock, and I was like, oh, where?
4782548	4783069	How large?
4785137	4804806	One thing I want to ask you, as a freestyler, because nobody else in this room can dance, but as a freestyler, just kidding, all in good fun, as a freestyler, what do you think about this kind of controversial, what do you think about the typical way to judge attorney, where you have the points, you grade everybody on a scale of 100, as opposed to this new, semi-new tower system they've got going, what do you think about that?
4805387	4812650	Well, they're both good in certain ways, but sometimes some people get too offended with the scores, like if they get lower than 70, they think they, like,
4813464	4815046	Thanks for watching!
4830982	4837247	The only thing about the tower system is it prevents people from getting biased because some people might complain if they don't qualify in the actual practice.
4850986	4857429	Well, I also got to think, too, that with the tower system, there's usually, in most cases, there are people that deserve the bottom spot.
4857449	4870573	Well, I mean, there are a few cases where, like, there are tournaments where there's all good freestyles, like TVGL1, but, so there are a lot of tournaments where some people just don't deserve anything higher than the bottom spot.
4871054	4879957	Well, as far as the tower system goes, when I went to MGL, the way the grade was kind of unique, but it kind of took a long time because there's, like, a lot of people participating.
4880780	4882282	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4902100	4908867	And the person who I put at the bottom, the person who I put at the very bottom, you know, I wouldn't say that it was necessarily bad.
4909007	4915274	I mean, it was just, it was fun, and it's the kind of thing where I think if I'd seen it, you know, Friday night at the arcade, it would have been cool.
4915294	4919679	But like, it's just like the tournament level, it's just not, it wasn't well prepared and polished.
4919699	4923923	And I think things, when they're in a tournament, need to be like polished, and it's all about show and presentation.
4923943	4924524	This was just kind of...
4924744	4925224	Thanks for watching!
4933462	4944867	Yeah, as far as the tournament goes, if a routine looks like something that people could do on a Friday night, it wouldn't be okay, but if it looks like a routine that people actually put their heart on, like practice, practice, practice, huh?
4944887	4946167	Did you say hard on?
4946407	4947068	No, heart!
4947688	4950349	Not hard on, look at my pants!
4950609	4955031	Well, you're playing it well with this group.
4955291	4957572	Okay, I've got the jump to conclusions mat.
4958833	4959053	Well...
4960442	4984785	My whole thing about the tower, I think that it still opens up the door for bias, even though you've got multiple people, which is why I don't know if anyone remembers the one that I did at Shaft, by having you judge on parts of the percentage, and that way the final result is based on each individual piece, rather than just giving them a flat score.
4985786	4988028	I think that that sort of closes the door on bias, too.
4988088	4994174	And it still actually allows room for bias because one of the sections was, what is your opinion of this match?
4994614	4997197	What is you, as someone just watching it, what do you think?
4998018	4998819	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
5017691	5021818	Yeah, because if people don't get biased, then people will not improve on their routines.
5022338	5025183	I've seen people who say, oh, they got low scores.
5025744	5028528	They actually look at their stats to see what they need to work on.
5028848	5030892	Hell, I even do that, like what mistakes I've made.
5032188	5033009	Yeah, there you go.
5033029	5036451	Like what mistakes I've made and everything, or what other people make mistakes.
5036731	5043796	At the end, try to think of the negatives and not do it, and look at the positives and work on that even more and make it a better routine.
5044056	5046738	That's what I try to do as well as the judges, right?
5046778	5048759	Something negative and something positive about everybody.
5049059	5054263	I put something negative about the people I put in first place or person, then I put something positive about the person I put in last place.
5054323	5056204	Just because, you know, everybody wants to hear something good and bad.
5056687	5057247	Yeah, true.
5057828	5065733	But sometimes some people get very offended with it, so they want advice, like, try to do something original, you could say that, if the routine is not original.
5067093	5069975	Or try to be more smooth, you could say, or something like that.
5070055	5072177	It's like, guys, the ketchup dance is not that original.
5072197	5073958	Stick to PA.
5074058	5075979	Stick to PA, yeah, man.
5076799	5077540	Well, PA's different.
5078220	5080622	But you don't want people saying, like, you suck on the card.
5084232	5091294	That's the big thing, and I find that true to anything, like people who just randomly say, oh, well, you suck, or this sucks, or that sucks.
5091754	5097455	Well, how is the thing or person that sucks going to know how to do anything if you don't tell them what sucks?
5098355	5102216	Yeah, you have to give constructive feedback, and that's what I like about having the comment cards.
5102676	5106337	Yeah, like advise them, like, try to make your moves smooth.
5106697	5111218	Try not to fumble on a few moves, or try to make your routine a little bit creative.
5112054	5114656	Lose enough, have some fun, don't take it too seriously.
5114716	5115596	Yeah, exactly.
5115816	5122381	I've seen people make mistakes like trying to memorize the steps and everything and it ends up making them so nervous that they're getting everything.
5122761	5124442	See, that's always when I judge.
5124462	5127324	The biggest thing that I look for is I look for their expression.
5128115	5130878	I don't care if they miss one of their moves.
5131538	5133880	I don't know what they had planned.
5134081	5140166	I haven't been sitting there looking at their choreographed piece of paperwork or at the screen.
5140206	5145431	I'll glance at the screen occasionally to see if maybe they're hitting the steps okay, because that shows preparation.
5146411	5150994	But the first thing I look for is to see how they're smoothing over their mistakes.
5151254	5154777	How they are portraying themselves and if they're playing to the crowd.
5155117	5161421	If they're sitting there with this high energy routine and they're just going ooooh on their face, I'm not going to enjoy it.
5162106	5162366	True.
5162466	5165708	They must have a smile on their face to show that they're actually having fun.
5166248	5167169	Exactly.
5169010	5177754	As much as I hate to use her as an example, one person who I think actually does display this, what I'm talking about is actually Fiona, Dr. Hikaru.
5178474	5179715	When she freestyles, she smiles.
5180956	5181796	She plays to the crowd.
5182616	5183397	Maybe, you know...
5185073	5187274	No, I'm talking about actually as a performer.
5187934	5196436	She actually does have good performance skills because you never, at least any time that I've ever seen her do anything, she never looks like she's concentrating too hard.
5196796	5198536	She looks like she's performing.
5199356	5203377	You know, putting forth the best show, putting forth the best face for the audience.
5204238	5205298	And that's what freestyle should be.
5205578	5206378	Yes, yeah.
5206418	5209919	Almost like most of the people who are like raking the tiles, that's where they belong.
5210739	5213980	Think of like people like Hypnotics, Bruce Leroy.
5214040	5214220	Yeah.
5215931	5220734	Those are people I've never seen sit and frown while they're doing a high-energy performance.
5220774	5223416	They're awesome.
5224297	5227359	It's just your expression.
5227459	5229701	I think that 50% of a performance is your expression.
5229741	5230721	The rest of it is the work.
5231782	5232463	True, true.
5233864	5236966	So you're saying if I smile the whole time and just play, then I'll get like 50?
5237907	5239228	No, I'm not saying that.
5239248	5240849	Oh, no, no, no, no.
5241710	5243632	Yeah, you get 50, the rest of it'll suck.
5245553	5248175	Then I'll throw in a knee drop and get a 95.
5250137	5252579	Well, 50 would be better than what I got last time.
5254701	5258424	Reserve the knee drops, hand plebs, matrix walks, and bar raping.
5258844	5262267	But you had everybody going, ooh, right when you started, you know.
5264088	5264269	Anyway.
5268212	5269233	Hey, what's the deal?
5269253	5273095	I mean, I know these songs are played out, but maybe somebody can do something original with it.
5273135	5276977	I mean, hey, they, they, you were, I mean, they don't know you.
5277017	5280759	They don't know how you would have just busted out some crazy shit or something.
5282300	5283620	Come on, comment somebody.
5283680	5284821	Please help me, I'm drowning.
5284841	5292725	I don't know, I kind of want to see someone like Kid Zero do a routine to Dynamite Rave or something, because he could actually make one look really, really good if he wanted to.
5292985	5293886	I mean, he's crazy.
5295000	5298507	Well, the only problem with the steps, the only thing I don't like about the song is the steps.
5298988	5299990	The actual basic steps.
5300010	5300812	There's so many jumps.
5302293	5309878	Well, the thing about this is that even stuff, you know, that could even, though, open up the door for trying to innovate on how to do a jump.
5310018	5312080	You know, there's different ways to do things.
5312100	5317984	You know, I want to do, I wanted, actually, I had one worked out a long time ago when all I had was second mix.
5318584	5322287	I had a routine worked out to WW involving pom-poms, doing a cheerleading dance.
5322327	5322787	Cool.
5323287	5325849	I'm not sure that's seen by SVGL or not.
5326129	5327070	And you know what, though?
5327270	5328551	It would work because of the jumps.
5329644	5333587	I was a lot more flexible in those days.
5334068	5338651	And you know what, Captain Jack Basick, you can Riverdance on that.
5339352	5340252	Yeah, I've heard about that.
5340953	5343795	Who knows, people could start freestyling to Max 300 and Max Unlimited.
5344756	5345436	It could happen.
5345897	5346557	I did that before.
5349239	5352442	Well, a lot of poppin' lockin' and...
5355656	5357257	So what do you, actually, Yes, exactly.
5357357	5359539	What do you notice as the current trends in freestyle?
5359579	5361320	What type of styles are people aiming more toward?
5362300	5364622	Well, not including newbite styles.
5364642	5368905	Sorry if I'm offending anybody who does those hand plants, knee drops, etc., etc., etc.
5370226	5370666	Well, true.
5371286	5372927	It's all I can do, man!
5374889	5379212	But people like aiming some stuff they see from music videos or whatever.
5380012	5381653	Sometimes they're trying to make up their own.
5382574	5384015	And some people have their own signature moves.
5385345	5386986	Almost everybody has their own signature moves.
5387106	5396573	I actually don't see a problem with an occasional hand plant or an occasional knee drop as long as it doesn't make their whole routine and actually maybe a transition to another move.
5397153	5404718	Yeah, like if you want to do something like... Did you see After the Game of Love by Trampower and Shaft?
5404738	5407820	He did like a knee drop, but he did like a very special version of it.
5410041	5410902	Super knee drop.
5411683	5412003	Like a...
5412822	5414923	Well, let's say romantic or exotic somewhat.
5415263	5417205	He laid a smackdown onto the pad.
5419706	5421407	He showed some love to that down arrow.
5422728	5424629	Oh, no, impregnation right there.
5424669	5427911	What a down arrow.
5428011	5431213	Or people do hand slaps on the thing, like on the ground, just to play around.
5431453	5435295	Yeah, I mean, as long as you're just not like, you know, oh, I'm standing.
5435455	5436656	Oh, my knee's on the right arrow.
5436716	5437496	Oh, I'm standing again.
5437576	5438937	That, you know, no.
5439197	5440258	But I think that...
5441480	5447561	You know, I don't think that people should just automatically discount a type of move because it's old or lots of people have done it.
5447781	5448942	You just have to innovate on it.
5449302	5449822	Yeah, true.
5449922	5454903	You don't want to repeat the same hand plant, knee drop move over and over and over unless you're entering something like A-Team.
5455583	5455923	Yeah.
5457083	5457624	Or Freshness.
5457724	5459324	Or Freshness.
5459384	5461224	DCB, hope you're listening to this.
5461464	5461804	He is.
5461844	5462425	He says hi.
5463265	5463625	Alright.
5463645	5464225	He says hi, guys.
5466052	5473674	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5496172	5497913	Starting off, boys and girls.
5498733	5499954	Oh my god.
5500814	5503356	Alright, we got a big, big FUs of the Week segment.
5503396	5504957	So here it goes, ladies and gentlemen.
5505617	5507678	We have a lot of new listeners to the show tonight, Jamie.
5507738	5510339	I know I have you do this a lot, but I think it's important.
5510720	5513301	Let's remind the listeners what the FUs of the Week are all about.
5513775	5518179	Our FUs of the week is where we take everything that we think sucks and go, fuck you!
5518720	5519881	Fuck you right in your ass!
5520761	5522863	And do they have to be about DDR or any of that stuff?
5522883	5525166	No, they can be whatever the hell you want.
5525586	5529810	This is when you give them a fuck, you shove so far up their ass they're tasting the chalk.
5531451	5535755	That being said, Jamie... I want a taramik today.
5537783	5540945	My FU goes out to Jamie for being a picky bitch.
5544407	5547789	I wanted to start off with the best line from video game music ever.
5548210	5549110	This is fucked up?
5549511	5550851	Hold on, let me see if I can find it.
5550952	5552933	There it is, Schlagwerk Terror.
5554114	5554514	Here we go.
5561939	5563100	This is fucked up.
5563320	5563460	Okay.
5563940	5564261	Okay.
5565974	5570496	My Fuck You of the Week, first and foremost, goes toward MapQuest.
5572256	5574457	Except I was asleep for most of the trip, but I had to pee.
5575437	5581039	MapQuest got us lost, but I'll let Robbie the Woodpecker explain all that later.
5581299	5587701	My other Fuck You goes to the bump in the parking lot at Fun Time Pizza, because I had to pee then, too.
5588822	5591423	And the bump was big, and it made me have to pee more.
5593184	5601854	My other fighting goes toward... There's one I've been debating about mentioning because I really just think it's more hilarious than anything.
5604197	5610764	To the little fucker who's been spamming my live journal, I know who you are and I think it's damn funny that you're still bringing this up.
5611909	5613810	My god, people just can't let stuff drop.
5614050	5617431	Anyway, that was pretty... It was pretty hilarious, I had a laugh.
5617511	5618131	Shine lose.
5618471	5619231	Shine lose.
5620832	5629674	My other fuck you goes toward my cold, which actually had me comatose on Wednesday, thanks to my flow, capital N, small I think fucking few.
5630494	5631635	Green death, orange death?
5631715	5632255	Green death.
5633815	5635416	You know, my teeth are green, Merry fucking Christmas.
5638186	5648168	but it settled in my lungs because I've had nasty ass cough and I was going to do PA yesterday but because of my cough I haven't really been able to play much DDR.
5648208	5655850	It's been hard to walk up the stairs without my asthma hacking up because my breathing... Oh my god, you've got a dog between your legs!
5656330	5659731	You've got a big black cough.
5662445	5663765	You are not supposed to have a dog there.
5663785	5665726	You're supposed to have a pussy there.
5666586	5668207	Angel's giving you Propel to make it better.
5668908	5669328	Thank you.
5669728	5671849	Oh, I like Peach Propel though.
5672169	5678512	Oh yeah, fuck you to the Walgreens in town for not having Peach Propel yet.
5679932	5685975	And fuck you to... Oh yeah, I buried my old shoes finally.
5686535	5688336	The shoes that I fucked off last week.
5688856	5689797	And I have new shoes.
5690882	5693604	And my shoes are black and gray and yellow.
5694244	5695205	My shoes are fresh.
5695805	5696105	Yo.
5697426	5702269	And fuck my shoelaces that I couldn't find because they're purple and black checkered.
5702969	5704750	I found my rainbowy ones but they were too bright.
5705771	5709073	Um, and um, um, yeah.
5710113	5715697	Oh, and um, um, fuck not being able to think of anything else.
5716437	5717478	Oh yes, more fucks.
5719119	5719339	Fuck
5720188	5722550	The situation that I heard about today.
5723111	5728615	My fiance, Dan, who I love greatly, ran into somebody's door.
5729616	5731458	It wasn't his fault, it wasn't their person's fault.
5731998	5744669	He was turning into a parking space, in a private property and everything, he was turning into a parking place, and this person with their brand new car that only had 96 miles on it, a Chrysler, Dan ran into their open door.
5745669	5748192	So the door's fucked up, our front bumper is fucked up.
5749271	5770380	and this is indeed fucked up and so now it's going to be on our insurance and their insurance but I don't think it was really but I think we're going to be getting a new car which is cool I want a car and fuck every single 86 Corolla hatchback in town for not being mine and that's it
5771357	5773799	Actually, I'm going to go next because Loki's list is too big.
5774479	5776281	So... Fuck Loki's list!
5776301	5778622	My list isn't that big.
5779083	5782986	My FU of the week... We'll do FU.
5783186	5784307	We'll go around the room to everybody.
5785828	5786028	Okay.
5786388	5787769	Yeah, we go first because it's our show.
5790891	5791652	Possessive us?
5791732	5791932	No.
5794394	5796335	The first FU I'd like to give is to MapQuest.
5796395	5796996	You suck.
5797956	5798317	Die.
5800168	5804492	Funtime Happy Pizza Place or whatever the fuck it was called is not off of mission.
5805173	5807595	It's completely on the other side of the galaxy.
5808136	5809898	Why the hell were you telling me it was there?
5810218	5810618	Die.
5811459	5814202	Die along with your firstborn and your ex-wife.
5815783	5816224	I hate you.
5817367	5821288	My next FU goes out to MTV and music videos in general.
5821789	5823369	They were so much cooler in the 80s.
5824169	5825810	VH1 Classic Forever.
5825850	5827231	Yes, that one animated head.
5827731	5829731	VH1 Classic Forever.
5830312	5832192	With the drugs flying out of the neck.
5832532	5833233	Who was that?
5833253	5835033	Thomas Tobey?
5835073	5835634	Yeah, Thomas Tobey.
5839461	5841703	F you to Nakari for wearing my shirt yesterday.
5843405	5843986	I'm just kidding.
5845447	5846808	Nakari's my hero, what can I say?
5858577	5860839	Um, let's see, what other FUs do I have?
5861380	5864402	Um, FU to Brad, because he's a dick.
5865203	5867645	And, uh, alright, that's all I have to say for now, I guess.
5867665	5869366	Brad's a dick, like a rock star.
5871028	5873590	And F being single, it still sucks.
5873950	5874271	Alright.
5875532	5875812	Loki!
5879358	5885063	Well, I have a list only because I found a new use for my camera yesterday since it does record audio.
5885364	5891069	So I was doing FUs recorded into my camera as I was encountering them.
5891149	5892631	So I just typed them up to make it easier.
5893962	5895303	Okay, let's start at the top of the list here.
5895523	5899286	F you to the Raley's that's freaking near in Fremont.
5899586	5902648	F you to them because they don't have a Chinese food section.
5902728	5903909	I really wanted Chinese food.
5905370	5908532	They did not have Chinese food to go there, and that pissed me off.
5908873	5910334	You know why that is, Loki?
5910674	5913956	Because right around that Raley's, there's like 50 bazillion Chinese restaurants.
5914016	5914817	That doesn't matter.
5915237	5916718	That doesn't matter at all to me.
5916778	5918019	But they did have Cracker Nuts.
5918480	5921262	Okay, I wanted freaking Chinese from there.
5921542	5922863	And they didn't have Maxim's.
5924395	5926395	Nomaxim Magazine, or PSM.
5926435	5928396	So they suck ass and they can burn in hell.
5929116	5931037	Um, on the MapQuest, you already mentioned that.
5931297	5934777	Um, F you to the convenience store, it's right there by Funtime Pizza.
5935157	5936178	Listen, you dumb bitch.
5936678	5938238	Or actually, stupid bastard.
5938598	5940879	I don't want your fucking $2 bill and 50 cent piece.
5941459	5945020	No change machines take $2 bills and the 50 cent piece doesn't work in there either.
5945320	5949001	You can take that $2 bill and 50 cent piece and shove it up your ass.
5949521	5950781	Learn to speak fucking English.
5951461	5952021	Retard.
5952522	5954102	Okay, and let's see here.
5954963	5956503	Now for the restaurant.
5956683	5959925	We went to Jurassic Ice Cream and Restaurant.
5960265	5962726	First of all, why are you calling it Jurassic Ice Cream and Restaurant?
5962746	5963767	There's no fucking dinosaurs.
5963807	5965027	It's not dinosaur themed.
5965267	5967148	It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
5967188	5972150	You have Asian people running a freaking restaurant that serves like hamburgers and ice cream.
5972170	5973011	It makes no sense.
5973231	5974911	Jurassic, where the fuck did you pull that out of?
5975272	5976352	Oh, I said the park, the park.
5976612	5977933	That freaking movie is cool.
5978153	5978773	The dinosaurs.
5978813	5980174	And now we're in a stupid restaurant.
5981044	5989008	Listen, I don't like ice in my fucking drink, and when you give me more ice than there's actual soda, I'm gonna take that ice, and freaking, first I'm gonna murder you.
5989168	5995751	I'm gonna put you in that fucking ice.
5997212	5997972	No, no, no, okay.
5998392	6004636	I'm gonna bury you in this ice, and yeah, okay, so F you to them for putting too much ice in my drink.
6005016	6005676	And it's crushed ice.
6005716	6008637	I like crushed ice, but still, too much ice.
6008898	6009258	Okay.
6010179	6011300	Uh, let's see here.
6012121	6021153	Now, today, I was at the theater, and some, some bitch, okay, with her ass the size of a Buick, fucking decides, I'm gonna decide where I wanna sit now!
6021394	6023717	So she stands in front of me with her ass, like, in my lap.
6024157	6026921	Listen, you dumb bitch, I don't want a lap dance from you nasty...
6027922	6031924	from this nasty bitch, let alone, you know, while seeing this movie, okay?
6032324	6034845	And then you have to sit next to me munching on your fucking Doritos.
6034925	6035486	Okay, listen.
6036266	6036926	You can go to hell.
6037246	6038547	Your ass is too big for the theater.
6039447	6039768	Sorry.
6040608	6041148	Don't come back.
6041768	6042009	You hear?
6042869	6046050	And, um, let's see.
6046911	6049772	F you to the minivan with license plate 4YKZ148.
6054229	6056291	You're a dumbass and you can't drive.
6056872	6060296	Listen, if you're going to cut in front of us, stop trying to put on your brakes and shit.
6060376	6060897	And guess what?
6061357	6063460	Minivans suck, so you can burn in hell.
6065904	6068826	And finally, finally, oh, one more.
6069526	6073528	Another one is for Derby Club owners taking different tokens.
6073908	6075089	These tokens are so tiny.
6075229	6079791	I mean, why don't you just use a standard token size?
6079891	6084733	I mean, instead of having these machines that dispense these smaller, tiny-ass tokens for this machine.
6084973	6090576	It's expensive enough, and I don't want to have to spend $20 on some token and then find out, oh, look, they don't fit in the damn machine.
6090596	6091957	There's financial reasons for that.
6093418	6103285	MGL has some deal with Sega for like the first 90 days or something they have a machine they have to use separate tokens so they can get an exact count of how much money they're making off of it.
6103985	6110070	You mean they could just like, oh no, go into the freaking operator settings and see the freaking stats for that?
6110090	6114273	No, because... Like any other machine on the face of the fucking planet?
6114473	6119097	Actually, well, there's a problem with that because with all the double token deals they can't get... Why, why, why, why?
6122479	6123881	It doesn't really fucking matter, okay?
6125062	6126564	You don't understand how arcades work.
6126584	6127464	You've never worked it before.
6127565	6128005	Finally!
6128025	6130908	This is why Sega has no systems anymore.
6131088	6133150	Finally!
6133931	6134712	May I finish?
6135373	6135693	Okay.
6135773	6135933	No.
6137506	6148269	Finally, and this is the biggest one of them all, for people fucking cutting me off in the coin lane, I don't give a fuck if you're running a tournament, announcing the freaking results for freestyle, you don't fucking cut in front of me.
6148489	6165653	Virtue, you cut in front of me too, I don't care if you're leaving, and also, to the dumbass that was freaking MGL, I don't care if you're leaving town if this is your last fucking game, I don't care if your mother's dying, I don't fucking care if your house is on fire, if you have STDs and you have to get home to put some cream on your ass, listen,
6166093	6167414	Don't fucking come for me!
6167434	6174499	You come for me again, I'm gonna rip off your fucking nuts, beat up my dog, and I'm gonna burn your body in hell!
6175079	6176941	Last week on Orange House Radio.
6179503	6180003	And that's all.
6180824	6182785	Goddamn, your face got hella red.
6184666	6186147	That deserves applause there.
6186367	6189990	There are veins popping out of his head in places you never knew there were veins.
6191311	6192412	Ain't children listening to this?
6193152	6195857	Please do not tell your mothers that we do this or anything like this.
6198381	6200023	I'm just kidding about that vertu, it was funny.
6205376	6207217	You're being worshipped in the showroom right now.
6207317	6210338	It's the Loki show, ladies and gentlemen.
6211178	6214500	The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio are all Loki's.
6214620	6215700	They're all his.
6216440	6218321	Yes, so send him all the emails.
6218361	6220602	Alright, moving on to the rest of the room.
6220642	6223483	Let's go around and talk to our guests, starting off with Wackwab.
6223743	6224323	It's me.
6225084	6232767	Okay, first of all, a big fucking hell to my bike because the tire went flat again during class.
6234718	6241818	So I ended up having to walk my bike around everywhere I thought my F2 song was the cat song I changed my mind
6242574	6243375	Well, fuck you then!
6244896	6253623	Okay, um, yeah, fuck all my new, er, fuck my new math teacher from Calculus because he does not speak English at all.
6253643	6254683	You wanna fuck your teacher?
6255084	6255884	No, I don't!
6256125	6257125	He's hot for teacher.
6258086	6264991	It's some, it's some old scrawny Russian dude that has such a horrible accent it sounds like he's speaking Spanish instead of English.
6265732	6266312	It's bad.
6267193	6270235	I'm looking at, I'm trying to listen to what he's saying in the lectures and I'm like...
6271724	6271984	What?
6272484	6276106	Hold on, did you say derivative or something else?
6276426	6277387	I don't know what you're saying!
6277427	6279187	I just want to stand up and yell at his face.
6279227	6282329	It's like, Speak English, motherfucker!
6285210	6285950	Yes, anger.
6287031	6289732	Everybody in this room needs anger management courses right now.
6289752	6290633	Damn straight!
6290913	6293414	I can manage my anger just fine by kicking someone's ass.
6296323	6303269	That's what Aura's Lounge is, it's our venting thing, you know, we don't want anger out there.
6303329	6303729	Okay.
6304510	6308673	No, it's not, I'm still going, I'm still going, I'm still going, I'm still going, I'm still going.
6308713	6309634	It was just meditation.
6310154	6318741	I have to also add to the fuck you on MapQuest, because thanks to them, I had to sit in the backseat of Rob's car with having to piss.
6319702	6328028	I sat there for probably about 45 minutes, holding it while we were trying to find this damn pizza place, driving around the wrong side of Fremont.
6328749	6334473	We're going around Mission Boulevard, up 680, up 880, in a big frickin' circle.
6335333	6336914	Well, it'll be warm for a minute.
6337475	6339196	It's a big car, I can roll over.
6340297	6341498	I'll just blame it on that guy.
6341798	6343499	Of course, the other guy in the backseat was mad.
6343979	6344360	Yeah.
6345410	6346831	It was... Oh, God.
6347772	6348812	And, um, let's see.
6349212	6349693	Uh, what else?
6350273	6352875	Um... Hmm.
6352995	6363181	Uh, fucked my car for having a bad timing belt in it, because now I can't bring it up with me to Davis this quarter until it gets fixed, and it's going to cost $800 to fix.
6364182	6365703	And why are you messing with my dog?
6365783	6367103	Don't abuse my dog!
6369085	6371426	Well, you were trying to turn its tail into a cock, so it's...
6375852	6376412	I had one more.
6376432	6378293	I think I had one more.
6378313	6383536	I'm trying to remember what it is.
6384597	6389660	Fuck my hard drive for being too small because I couldn't burn CDs because it didn't have enough room to copy the information.
6390200	6390660	What's wrong, guys?
6390800	6391441	Hard drive envy?
6392972	6394573	I only have a 20 gig hard drive.
6394913	6395894	I feel so weak.
6396794	6398395	I feel so weak and primitive.
6398535	6400016	It's not size that matters, man.
6400197	6401277	I haven't let you know.
6402238	6404399	Wait, actually, this is hard drive talk.
6404439	6404899	I forgot.
6405860	6407041	Yes, size does matter.
6408201	6409042	I still feel small.
6410103	6410343	Done?
6410483	6411323	Are you done?
6411343	6411504	Good.
6416417	6420599	The following one I want to say will be very offensive to children under 17.
6423020	6423621	Dave, get out.
6425762	6427883	He said children under 17 is very offensive.
6427983	6431725	But if you want to lose it anyways, go ahead.
6431985	6433646	Don't blame me for everything I'm going to say.
6435727	6437648	Fuck, shit, cock, piss, cunt, whore.
6439109	6439789	Oh, that, that.
6441310	6444951	Okay, the first fuck you I have to deal with is Matt Piss.
6447119	6448539	Give me warm directions one time.
6449680	6454041	I got lost for 30 minutes just because it only took me like 15 minutes just to get there regularly.
6455642	6461003	That's my friend's house.
6461403	6466205	Fuck being cursed, because I'm always never getting the chance to do whatever I could do, usually.
6467425	6468325	Let me see.
6468625	6470946	Oh yeah, here's the one big F you right here.
6470966	6472247	A big F you right here.
6472267	6472507	Okay.
6472907	6474347	December 13th.
6474927	6475848	Okay, Friday is their turn too.
6475868	6476708	The day of MGL.
6478112	6484836	This is the reason why Explicit was destroyed, the alpha part, and why I switched to beta.
6486476	6494461	Let me see, the first part that happened in Des Moines, I lost my damn disc, I had almost all my final stuff I needed to turn in, which cost me like 20% of my grades.
6496081	6500444	Yes, I had an A to a C, or a B to a D, which killed me so badly.
6502392	6511086	well that includes Computer Science 15 yes, computer programming and the teacher said plagiarism for not even copying anything
6512796	6514116	Look at that, he can kiss my ass!
6516137	6517277	I said my 12 inch cock!
6517397	6521117	Thank you for that visual.
6526378	6528499	That was you, like, throwing your cock across the room.
6529399	6530579	Catch, Jamie, catch!
6530739	6533960	What do you mean to the word detachable penis?
6535360	6536220	Okay, that's it.
6536380	6541001	Let me see, back to the day of MGR Friday the 13th.
6542805	6545568	I tried driving there, almost got into an accident, not my fault.
6546749	6550672	My car almost burned down because the car fan broke on my car.
6551673	6554376	It could have been stuck in the road out of nowhere.
6556338	6564045	And PA hella sucks on MGL because what the hell does a Qualifier song have to be so fucking hard compared to
6565490	6584276	MGL2Evil, LookAtMyHeart, Reverse, Dark, Hidden, and why does the rest of it have to be... You know, yesterday for Perfect Attack the qualifier song was Sugaru, Boost, Reverse, no it wasn't Reverse, Boost, uh, Flack!
6584716	6593044	Boost Flat Mirror, oh my god, I seeded 13th out of 16 people and I somehow came in 4th in the end, don't ask me how that happened, anyway.
6593084	6603954	Well, Sukaru, that was the easy, that was easy shit, but then my book, how can you do Hidden Dark Reverse, that's like fucked up, what the song says, this is fucked up.
6606658	6607158	Let me see.
6608138	6611339	As far as that PA part, that made me less interested in PA.
6612979	6613299	Bitch.
6614319	6614800	And Jill.
6615780	6618580	And since it wasn't put in free play, I screwed up.
6619700	6619961	Yes.
6620161	6622341	And I had to do an improv, a straight up improv.
6622901	6624381	Playing around, I actually knew the steps.
6624881	6627482	But it ended up being too obvious that everybody knew it was just an improv.
6628542	6629662	Well, even though he plays 11.
6629762	6631463	But still, I wanted to do my real routine.
6631483	6632823	I worked pretty hard on it.
6634025	6637287	and I wasted a hell of a... that means like twenty... how much money did I waste?
6637987	6642449	Fuck, I wasted sixty bucks total because not many people paid me back for the balls.
6644250	6646412	Not everybody, half the people paid me back for the balls.
6647392	6648553	It's like, can I have a free try?
6648933	6649993	Fuck, I have to waste money.
6650494	6653975	I almost didn't have enough money to pay for the gas money to come back to Sacramento.
6655096	6660499	In other words, I have to borrow money and end up being
6662421	6664442	I have to pay him back like 5 bucks more.
6664462	6668643	Cause again, 5 bucks if you can borrow 10 bucks from me.
6669323	6672485	Just remember, you gotta tell people, you give favors like you give head.
6674565	6676106	Okay, that's too much to say right there.
6676226	6677626	It's, yeah, not at all.
6677706	6679147	It's from Go.
6681848	6682188	Yeah.
6682208	6686409	Yeah, but just to let you know, that day just killed my reputation.
6686770	6689070	But now I'm a new person, so.
6689371	6690271	You can't kill me now.
6692595	6700899	And I have some pro- let me see, fuck the incompatibility between StepManiac and my- for some reason my Windows XP does not work with StepManiac for some reason.
6703780	6708142	Okay, Loki, talk- and fuck the server that kinda crashed, um, Sakimani, um, forums.
6709420	6711141	That is a very fuck, fuck, fuck.
6711201	6711962	Fuck that server.
6712022	6712863	Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.
6712883	6716565	Because I went into the make-edit-get-porn contest, damn it!
6716585	6725172	$1hosting.com with the commercial with the bouncing babes in bikinis wearing the pirate shirts that's saying, you know, our host with $1hosting.com.
6725192	6725772	What the hell?
6726973	6728695	I never knew that commercial existed.
6728775	6729875	We had already signed up for it.
6729895	6733478	Fuck you for restoring us back to September without our permission.
6733979	6734439	You fucking...
6734699	6737803	Yeah, I missed the make it or get point card, I couldn't sign in.
6738244	6740026	I missed all the things I was gonna get.
6741027	6744672	And since I'm like 19 and a half, I would have been able to get the stuff.
6745649	6747250	I still got plenty left, man.
6747970	6748590	Don't worry about it.
6748871	6752512	There ended up not being a contest because two people entered.
6755394	6757315	And so I'm giving this porn out to everyone who entered.
6757335	6757795	So I'll give it to them.
6757815	6759116	Chatroom's yelling at us to hurry up.
6759156	6760056	I don't want their FUs.
6760816	6761717	Okay, I'm listening.
6762457	6763018	F the chatroom.
6763558	6765399	I'm listening.
6766099	6770881	And if I get screwed by anybody or anybody in the future, I'll say it loud and clear.
6772757	6776441	Everybody just say nice and loud, nice and proud.
6778383	6779244	Fuck you!
6781046	6781826	Okay, my turn.
6781927	6782467	Oh, Dave's turn.
6782507	6783969	Wait, I have special music for Dave.
6784589	6787732	Yeah, it better be... What?
6790055	6790635	What is this?
6791376	6791937	Wait, what?
6794720	6795801	It's the My Little Pony theme.
6796596	6797777	Oh, that's my favorite!
6797837	6800539	Why do you have my little pointy music on your computer, Rob?
6800799	6801179	Jamie.
6802820	6803321	That's sick.
6803361	6806783	Okay, now switch it to the Gumlande couple or whatever.
6806803	6808444	Shut up and give us your FU.
6808544	6808844	Fine.
6809645	6812046	I have... Okay, yeah, yeah.
6812907	6813267	That one.
6813748	6815069	Yeah, give me the guacamole one.
6815409	6819051	Okay, anyway, while I'm doing that, guacamole del taco.
6819391	6822834	Anyway, while that, I'll just start my FU, because I don't have that many anyway.
6823607	6826390	So anyway, okay, you're confusing me, oh shit.
6826430	6828713	You sound like a KOG remix over there, Black Lab, shut up.
6829294	6836762	Okay, my first FU goes to my teachers at school for giving me so much to fucking study, because high school is hard.
6837423	6842249	Freshman year was easy, sophomore year, everyone is a bitch, and it's hard to have to study.
6842569	6843070	Thank you, Rob.
6843690	6848872	Anyway, my second FU goes towards my computer for being the biggest fucking piece of shit ever.
6849172	6852354	And my mom won't buy me a fucking new one because it's such a piece of shit.
6852434	6855615	And she's like, oh, we just need to get it completely recleaned and everything.
6857416	6858096	Oh, man.
6858636	6860737	No, I can't load any programs.
6861017	6862318	I can't load a Word document.
6862598	6865659	I can't, like, I can go online or go on IM.
6865719	6866720	You gotta load Microsoft.
6867780	6869401	Yeah, I can do one thing at a time.
6869441	6869961	Are you done?
6870461	6870921	No, I'm not.
6871002	6871542	I have one more.
6871642	6872062	Okay, hurry up.
6872509	6874310	Fuck you to girls for not liking me.
6875451	6876431	I don't ask for much.
6878572	6880813	Plenty of girls like you, just very few can tolerate you.
6880833	6884015	Hey, that wasn't nice.
6885355	6885796	Zinger.
6886056	6887397	Here's one thing to get some girls.
6888217	6889518	Freestyle.
6890038	6891078	I suppose I got something funny.
6891198	6891919	No, no, no.
6892139	6895481	Here's a way to get girls free money.
6897181	6902004	No, no, it's like... As the official girl here, the way you get a date...
6902851	6906012	is... I grab their money.
6906672	6908253	That or good oral sex.
6909753	6912814	Well, and... God damn it, let me finish.
6913335	6916616	I don't think good oral sex, you know, gets them, but it keeps them.
6917116	6919297	Okay, no, let me finish, god damn it.
6919317	6921117	With money, you can buy good oral sex.
6922618	6924918	Okay, let me finish now.
6925019	6926519	You know, I should actually... Wait, no.
6926799	6927219	Fuck!
6929680	6931322	Okay, it's not like I'm asking for much.
6931642	6932443	I want two things.
6933284	6934486	One, that they like me.
6934546	6936228	Two, that they're under 2,000 pounds.
6936768	6937729	That's all I ask.
6938690	6940152	Dave, when you're 18, we'll buy you a whore.
6940853	6941674	Whee!
6942154	6943676	I hope your parents are listening.
6944824	6946144	Star Award 800.
6946304	6946744	We are 18.
6948045	6949045	We'll make you a man, Dave.
6949065	6950145	We'll take you to the strip club.
6950525	6951345	Yeah.
6951945	6953106	Hey, take some Viagra.
6953406	6953846	We need it.
6954106	6954726	Smoke a XC Zero.
6954766	6955386	Here's a ball.
6955606	6957266	Does Brad have... Are you done with your FUs of the week?
6957466	6958086	Yes, I'm done.
6958106	6959427	All right, Brad, please give us your FUs.
6959507	6960207	I have a quick one.
6960387	6961227	Put on whatever you want.
6961247	6961847	I don't even care.
6962887	6963127	Yay.
6963327	6963587	Okay.
6963887	6967448	My FU is to this week's FU segment.
6967488	6969008	It's way too fucking long.
6969028	6971709	If you guys do this again, I'm going to run over all your guys' asses.
6974266	6976388	I know, but you guys take way too long.
6977288	6977949	I'm done.
6978669	6979750	Mine was the shortest.
6983252	6983913	She-Ra?
6985053	6986214	I have the power!
6986334	6988295	No, wait, that was He-Man.
6988496	6990217	I don't know.
6990337	6994900	Alright, let's get to the chat room.
6994920	6997481	You're going to have to cut these ones down, Rob, I think.
6997581	6998982	I'm going to read these fast.
6999002	7000183	I'm doing speed reader, okay?
7000223	7000583	Here we go.
7000683	7001004	First...
7001624	7019775	Corey the Sultan says, F you, fuck you Fremont, fuck you Red Shirt Guy, you won't get a DDR EX press release original soundtrack, fuck you DDR Extreme for not giving me a triple A on Dom Dariam, fuck you DDR Extreme for hurting my leg, fuck you Fremont for having shitty pads, fuck you Tinker for getting two grades on Waka Laka, fuck you Tinker for getting seven grades on Fantasy Max 1 version.
7020576	7025499	I was supposed to play Max 300 when I did his FUs and I didn't, so fuck me.
7026940	7031382	DCV says, fuck you to Mr. Cool at Fremont Tournament for bitching and moaning the whole time.

7044249	7047911	OrangeBeaniePatty says, fuck you to myself for deciding not to go to Fremont.
7049847	7052248	Muhimer says, I need to read his emails.
7053309	7059032	VRP Coating Style says, fuck you to people who pick on heavier people for trying to DDR.
7059092	7064596	Fuck you to Cleveland Aladdin's Castle for moving all the fans to the Max 2 machine and leaving the 5th and 6th players hanging.
7066776	7071900	USFBB says, fuck you to all those people who wouldn't help me earlier in my quest for knowledge about the menstrual cycle.
7072321	7075023	I will know everything about the vagina by next week.
7075323	7076284	Um, rave sluts.
7076785	7077826	Sorry, that was last week.
7078766	7089996	Chaos, a big fat fuck you to MilpitasGolfLandsPads because I got 14 greats on We Will Rock You Heavy, but two misses because the stupid pad stickied, and I couldn't play The Legend of Max.
7090096	7090736	Oh my gods.
7090857	7092118	Sorry about that, guys.
7092258	7092778	I got the pad stickied.
7092818	7094059	Sorry, I jizzed all over it.
7095874	7104960	DarkTetsuya says, fuck you to Dell, the new computer I was supposed to get for my birthday didn't come.
7106501	7112766	EvilNaoki2DX, how much would you pay me if I cosplayed as a schoolgirl and did a routine to Love Love Sugar?
7112786	7113586	39 cents.
7116960	7122742	DDR Angel, My Fuck You This Week is at my journal, livejournal.com slash tilde K-A-Y-L-E-A.
7123243	7124903	Go to last night's entry and read it random.
7124923	7125844	The whole story is there.
7126244	7131206	Only reason I said check my current journal post for the FU is because I don't know how to word it right.
7132686	7135667	I thought our journals protected everybody anyway, so how are we going to read it?
7136868	7137948	Well, I have access, but anyway.
7138549	7139469	Brad, shut the fuck up.
7139489	7140489	23rd Magus.
7143476	7146318	says, let Explicit know I'm working on my Max Unlimited routine.
7146738	7148139	I have an FU to Skrull once again.
7149079	7150720	Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it in its fucking ear.
7151220	7152561	I also have an FU to Stoic.
7152621	7156123	Before Jamie kills me, I'm talking about the steps by Chakrilla, not the song.
7156483	7158664	The song is leet, the steps are masochistic to play.
7158744	7159465	Fuck 56k.
7160065	7163967	I need to fucking download some mp3s from my DJ bit, and I get one song every half hour.
7164027	7164668	What the fuck?
7164768	7165068	Okay, out.
7165088	7166269	I thought Jamie didn't like Stoic.
7168250	7168450	Okay.
7168490	7170511	Wait, so the 23rd magazine next to me is talking to me?
7172614	7173735	Jamie doesn't like stoics.
7173895	7175136	Oh yes, that's what it's all about, I guess.
7175836	7176216	Good luck.
7177077	7179758	It's not as easy as you think, though, unless you're doing beginner mode.
7180079	7182560	Yeah, there's a beginner mode, actually.
7183180	7184281	But anyway, just good luck.
7185002	7186322	I want to see the routine sometime.
7186643	7189464	I want to see the Legend of Max on Maniac routine.
7189544	7190025	Good luck.
7190045	7190505	There you go.
7190565	7191325	You'll need it.
7191566	7191966	Oh god.
7193086	7195887	SoCalKicks says, Why were you in Saturday school, huh?
7195907	7196287	What's up?
7196307	7196627	Bad boy.
7196667	7196827	Bad.
7196847	7197988	Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
7216914	7218195	Let me get on with it, guys.
7218296	7222019	Bombay, fuck you to Roseville Golf Land for getting extreme before Scandia and sucking.
7223081	7225984	Bombay, fuck you to Sucking.
7226004	7229027	Hey, hey, you apologize right now, sir.
7229407	7230408	No, he knows I love him.
7230468	7230929	Oh, okay.
7231149	7231730	But not like that.
7232050	7235754	Vidpala says fuck you to restaurant customers who have 30 people in their party and only tip $1.00.
7236995	7237796	Oh, that's rude.
7238016	7240999	Because they supposedly only have enough money to pay the bill, but not enough to tip.
7241379	7243802	That's why you're supposed to add the money on the bill for the tip.
7243822	7246845	Actually, I thought that large parties over 15 gratuities were supposed to be added.
7247005	7251249	Yeah, I always thought that if you bring in a party to a restaurant with more than eight people, gratuities automatically added.
7251269	7252110	That's what always happens to me.
7252310	7252610	Yeah.
7252630	7253050	What the fuck?
7253731	7254552	Must be a Vegas thing.
7255633	7260698	Fuck you to the WB for not re-showing Everword on their Easy View today, because that show is awesome.
7263231	7264572	Actually, I saw the easy view today.
7264592	7266933	It was a small bill I saw.
7268594	7270836	Fuck you to not getting any free stuff at CES.
7270976	7273837	Fuck you to semester exams for being worth 20% of your semester grade.
7273998	7275338	And yes, let's like to rave.
7276439	7279781	Chubbs, fuck you to being sick because it made my PA suck.
7280242	7281903	Fuck you to Mr. Cool for being a douche.
7283083	7284084	You spelled douche wrong.
7285065	7289267	And last but not least, fuck you to Orange Lounge for not interviewing me at Fremont.
7289988	7291449	All I have to say to you is...
7295080	7295841	Cry a little more.
7296061	7298804	I'm just kidding.
7300946	7304689	Stresa says, private message to me.
7305390	7309233	Angel says, fuck you to my co-worker for bitching over me getting her one dollar bill.
7309594	7310855	It's just a dollar, bitch.
7311556	7312857	Fuck you, fuck you in your ear.
7312937	7314058	Jamie, you for that quote.
7314959	7316100	Oh, thank you, Jamie, for that quote.
7317372	7317872	Moving on.
7318792	7321033	Vidpower says they don't add to the tip because they're nice.
7322414	7323234	Jamie, that's lovely.
7324934	7331616	Now I've got to go to the email bag just for Muheimer's FU, because he's the only one that sends me FUs over email.
7331976	7335838	Muheimer says, fuck me for always sending my fuck yous by email.
7335898	7337018	Yes, you're in the chat room.
7337038	7337698	Why do you use email?
7337738	7338438	Oh, well, it's okay.
7338478	7338898	It's all good.
7338918	7340419	It gives us an excuse to go check the mail bag.
7341139	7342860	Fuck exams for being so early.
7342940	7343881	Cramming sucks.
7344642	7354308	Fuck yesterday's swim meet for being so horribly unorganized I was forced to sit in the hallway just to gather my thoughts while being stomped on by people and then being told that I can't eat food in the hallway.
7354668	7356089	Go die, Aquatics Director.
7356630	7361092	Anywho, fuck my best friend's sister's boyfriend for making her distressed over something.
7362033	7362634	That was fake.
7363134	7364375	Has an add-on to my emails.
7364875	7370359	Fuck pink and purple candy hearts for Valentine's Day because they're overpowering my bag's yumminess and they suck.
7375000	7375381	All right.
7375821	7378202	With that, ladies and gentlemen, we're done with the FUs of the week.
7381023	7381663	Oh, my God.
7381683	7382643	That went for an hour.
7383083	7383864	That was cool.
7385604	7388025	This has been angst hour on Wingsound Radio.
7389146	7390326	And I'm spent.
7391146	7391967	Back to sanity.
7393147	7393527	Wow.
7393887	7394227	Same?
7394628	7395408	Uh-uh.
7398090	7400852	Are we even going to do like a list list or anything like that?
7400872	7403374	I don't know if we're going to have time because we've got to do the cage match.
7403394	7405235	We're going to come back and we're going to do the cage match.
7405816	7408257	After the cage match, if we have time for a list list, we'll do one.
7408297	7412520	If not, we dig that bit in the ground anyway, right?
7412940	7414761	Do we have any ideas for a list list?
7415002	7417023	We'll think about them over commercial.
7418064	7418344	All right.
7419264	7421706	In the meantime, more extreme shit.
7422106	7422447	Enjoy.
7487745	7488906	Thanks for watching!
7547651	7548553	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
7580350	7581711	You got to bring your mind
7694318	7695221	Thanks for watching!
7786351	7787952	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
7788293	7793197	And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
7793917	7800023	But hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
7800363	7802245	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
7802825	7807209	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are great.
7808960	7810722	Yes, Irene has an important announcement.
7812003	7812763	We're coming back from break.
7812803	7813944	I paid off my debt.
7814385	7815165	I hate you.
7815185	7815786	I hate you.
7816346	7819429	And so I'm going to get a two-story house for you.
7819989	7820710	You're a cunt.
7822171	7823652	A real fucking cunt, you know that?
7824453	7827075	Why are you letting her be better than me at Animal Crossing?
7827095	7827656	This sucks.
7828797	7830638	Ow, ow, ow, ow, my tummy.
7831859	7833280	I was just thinking of something.
7833300	7834702	I paid off my house all the way.
7835885	7836465	So did Dan.
7837005	7838386	We have statues of ourselves.
7838406	7840286	Well, you know what you and Dan are?
7841846	7842186	Cool.
7843487	7846307	Yeah, you're kind of cool.
7846607	7848488	I was just thinking, I had a revelation.
7848828	7852489	You know why Mel said that he was like a broke ass?
7852729	7853589	Oh, in that commercial, yes.
7853609	7854289	He was a DOC.
7855229	7856550	Yeah, because of Derby Owners Club.
7856870	7858730	And I'm addicted to it now.
7858990	7860571	I played one game, I have a horse.
7860871	7862171	I want to play more!
7863775	7864577	Labrador Lover.
7865658	7866720	I can make a better name than that.
7867081	7867842	The reason why...
7870475	7875436	The reason why Mel B, I had to play that promo is because they might be back at the end of the month.
7875916	7879877	I know at least one of them is hopefully going to be coming up, Sharks Girl, the other half.
7882258	7883658	Might be bringing Mel B with her, might not.
7884118	7886999	But either way, we like Mel, so hopefully he'll be back at the show at some point.
7887399	7894021	Also in the future, I've been promised a visit from Chubbs and Maple at some point, so I'm going to make them do that.
7895021	7898022	And I don't know what other guests we'll have on the show in the future.
7899345	7902080	Let's get No Silent and Cory at the same time.
7903579	7905140	No styling on Corey Action.
7907202	7911485	We need to get, we seriously need to get Dark Sound back up here.
7911765	7912025	Yes.
7912526	7914067	Oh, that reminds me.
7914407	7914887	Thank you.
7915268	7918270	Next week, I have a three-day weekend.
7918830	7920712	Which means I don't have to work on Monday.
7921012	7923714	Which means I can have a hangover if I want.
7924214	7930519	Which means... Which means that since Jamie never gets hangovers, she can drink all she wants to anyway.
7931267	7934870	Next week on Orange Lounge Radio... Which means that Matt's driving me home.
7935691	7937392	The Drunk Show, boys and girls.
7937652	7942897	Sky and Dark Sakura, get drunk, live, on air, for your listening pleasure.
7944678	7945199	Oh, boy.
7946880	7950203	Rob, do you realize that it's going to be quite expensive to get me drunk?
7950743	7951243	It's all right.
7951324	7952685	We'll make it work somehow.
7953946	7955807	It's all about Winner's Cup vodka, man.
7956248	7957549	That stuff's, like, so cheap.
7958863	7961088	I've downed a bottle of wine in three minutes.
7961589	7962651	But wine's not hard.
7962671	7964034	You need some Goldschlager.
7964154	7966519	But if you drink a lot of wine really quickly...
7967918	7968919	I don't know, wine doesn't do anything to me.
7968939	7971801	Goldschlager's kind of nasty, although you can make really good... Tastes like burning.
7972081	7972421	I love it.
7972441	7976684	But you can make really good butterscotch milkshakes with goldschlager.
7976984	7977424	Really?
7977604	7978025	Oh yeah.
7978145	7978685	It's cinnamony.
7979526	7982107	You use butterscotch.
7982468	7982968	That sounds good.
7982988	7983428	Stuff with it.
7983809	7986210	Alright, so next week on Orange Lounge Radio, The Drunk Show.
7986550	7988151	Catching up on some comments in the chat room.
7988812	7992054	Vitpawa says, I should delete Irene's house in Animal Crossing.
7992554	7992714	Ah!
7992814	7992955	Hello!
7992995	7993395	How are you?
7994793	7996134	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8020610	8024552	And she's been working very hard on it and I've heard part of it and it sounds really fabulous.
8024852	8026732	And I'm in it, so you want to listen to me.
8032254	8035476	So we're going to have that on hopefully sooner than later.
8036801	8039222	But, you know, Michelle, take your time, work on it, make it sound cool.
8039782	8040542	What you already are doing.
8041362	8043203	Oh, okay, we made an offer.
8043403	8045463	I'm sorry, are you finished with... I guess.
8045784	8047084	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
8047864	8048724	Bite my big toe.
8050045	8050325	See ya.
8052325	8053046	Oh, no!
8053306	8055086	Rob bit my shoe, that was cool.
8055106	8055746	That is gross.
8055806	8056567	Go brush your teeth.
8058027	8058967	Now hit her over the head with a brick.
8060888	8061788	No, Rob and I watch Buffy.
8062611	8063031	Yes, we did.
8064232	8066453	Chubb says he will come up if we get him drunk next week.
8071816	8072396	Let's see.
8074017	8075598	He may have his first homosexual experience.
8080861	8084083	Stressa called Irene, by the way, the chick with the biggest dick on the air.
8085063	8087404	I thought that was cool.
8087484	8090066	I'm going to wash your face with bees if you don't shut the fuck up.
8093052	8094753	Oh no, they stung me!
8096774	8098815	Oh my god, oh my god.
8098835	8099176	Uh... Let's see.
8099236	8099556	O-M-G-W-T-F.
8099836	8100156	Alright.
8101197	8104699	Also, Hyper Aerobit was good the first time, you know, with D2R.
8104999	8105600	Yeah.
8105880	8108682	Let's talk to Loki about, um, the sim update.
8108742	8109682	No, no, no, you have to say it right.
8110223	8111163	It's D2R.
8113324	8114725	That says Revolution.
8114745	8116246	Oh, yeah.
8116627	8116787	D2R.
8116827	8118188	We're gonna do...
8121176	8122497	We have less than an hour!
8122897	8125198	I wanna do, uh, Loki's sim update, please.
8126078	8126558	Alright.
8127659	8127939	Alright.
8128799	8144585	Well, this, well, actually I should say, the end of last week was a big, big week, um, it was the, uh, Tourney Mix 3 results, and, well, you know, I HATE YOU ALL FOR NOT PLAYING MY FREAKIN' FILE, YOU CAN BURN IN HELL!
8144905	8146426	But, well, I'll save that for another day.
8147186	8147587	Invoque
8163626	8172969	3rd place was Boom Boom Dollar, the Red Monster Hypermix, from Dance Maniacs.
8175029	8175970	That was for Heavy.
8176790	8179591	Standard doesn't really matter, 1st place.
8180331	8183472	2nd place is Hey Hey Hey Hey, and 3rd place is Aryan.
8184953	8185794	The public voting.
8185874	8188177	The first place for Heavy was Invoke.
8188617	8191441	Second place was Stoic, done by Moogle Hunter.
8191701	8193443	It's really crazy.
8193523	8197949	Third place was Sue 4, which is a remix of Volume 4 and Cigaru.
8198029	8201774	It's kind of like Volume 4 with the Cigaru twanging in it.
8203295	8204416	It was interesting.
8205157	8206718	Standard first place was Eat Em Up.
8206798	8213783	It was a Pac-Man song from Ridge Racer Type 4, which you might be hearing later.
8215685	8221630	Second place is Blue Fever, which is a speed mix of Blue by Eiffel 65.
8222190	8225693	And the third place was Arian also.
8226694	8228495	Oh my god, it's the Hidden Seven style song.
8228535	8229436	You still have it unlocked.
8230216	8230677	Guess what?
8231057	8231397	Anyways...
8232618	8234699	So, what do I have to say about this?
8235100	8235900	Well, you know what?
8235980	8237461	I'm checking to see what place Loki got.
8238421	8240182	I got, uh, like 18th or something.
8240222	8242824	Loki got, uh, let's see.
8242984	8245105	Uh, 40, yeah, where it is.
8245125	8246026	Well, keep going down.

8248667	8249107	50 out of 68.
8249147	8251809	You were 50th out of 68 people.
8253270	8254730	That's because... Wait, what the hell?
8254750	8255651	Wait, I thought... Okay.

8286070	8287371	I'm sorry, Jamie's yelling at me.
8288071	8288792	Because I made her cry.
8288812	8289052	Well, sorry.
8290473	8291634	Could you play an MP3 for me?
8291815	8292375	I suppose.
8292455	8292675	What?
8294797	8295658	Yeah, Healing Erica.

8330262	8330542	Okay.
8331783	8333263	This is my thoughts of Tourney Mix 3.
8345219	8374559	When you diss me, you thought you fucking smart But art has no boundaries and neither do I So teach your name and smack on the decks and give it one more try The cocksuckers will remember me from tournament school The guy who made that peek of you I used I would never do Just because a person had made some of the generic trans shit You shower rockers broke me down as a crazy fucking git Well now I'm back to rock your world, my honest fucking life While your pussies don't realize you needed to survive Trapped inside a toilet in the seats of the world
8374939	8389665	A wonderful place for science, music art, and magic meld All you motherfuckers want a chance to wreck the bar Well fuck you or fuck your mom, go back to ooh la la And if you got an ounce of sense, then stay and fucking use it Life doesn't happen all at once, so why should you fucking use it?
8389905	8395627	As the colored arrows fill the screen, you're probably all just thinking I'ma wait until there's my latest work and let my spirit sink it
8396247	8425471	All these fuckers is bad dudes, I don't give a shit So take this fucking freeze arrow, and ram it up your clit All each day we wanna do is show you the meaning of life But you don't just throw it back at me, you had a sharper knife I'm not wasting any time on shit like you, and I'll fucking tell you why I don't want you to find happiness in your life, I want you to rather die These fucker sticks might hog a word, you son of a Yoki's dick Your stoner makes you go to hell, that cypress is a brick So all your asses can't go back to your faggot little dons DJ Damien signing out, you motherfucking nonce
8433874	8435515	That made Captain Jack fart.
8436135	8439357	Yeah, and for those who didn't know, that was DJ Damien with Art2.
8439957	8446500	He did a really shitty entry the first Tourney Mix 2, and he did a really shitty entry for Tourney Mix 3, but you know what?
8446520	8447441	That song is funny.
8449722	8454865	Basically, the fault I have to say in this, and a lot of people have problems, is there are so many files entered.
8455425	8458526	Obviously, I mean, I'm not surprised that I didn't get picked as far as...
8459787	8460348	Thanks for watching!
8479083	8484928	As far as sim stuff goes, my new site is actually sort of online right now.
8484968	8487550	I'm uploading pages and content later on this week.
8487590	8495737	I've sent out emails, a mass email to a bunch of different people at SimFile Creators out there, and so far I've only gotten one response back.
8495757	8501842	So I'm sending out another email to you guys, and it's going to basically be, if you don't send me back an email, I'm getting an okay to put your files on my site, so...
8502422	8505164	So if you don't want that happening, you better send me a fucking email.
8505444	8507265	So my site's coming up.
8507665	8514209	The URL for it is going to be www.willddrforfood.net slash leechfromloki.
8514309	8520312	And there's already a main page up there right now, but of course none of the links work because I haven't uploaded anything else yet.
8520412	8525795	So you can check that out right now, and there should be more stuff coming up later this week.
8526095	8530757	I'm shooting for the early part of this week, but I don't know.
8530858	8531178	We'll see.
8532871	8542233	and I'll be offering, there'll be places, an actual script where you can upload your own files and even your own page with your own files on it if you want or else I'll make you a page.
8542514	8545674	Basically, we're just going to have the largest collection of stuff on there.
8547615	8552396	So basically, you'll see that there's going to be... Do you have crap like that one in your collection too?
8552936	8553316	Why not?
8553356	8555657	Some people want to play that.
8556297	8558938	Maybe we'll put that in a section of files that suck or something like that.
8558998	8559338	I don't know.
8560078	8561118	Really doesn't matter to me.
8561259	8564400	So, other than that, let's see.
8564460	8571242	I think I'm going to have... There's going to be some interviews with Simphile Creators, and we're going to do some themed releases and that kind of thing.
8571302	8573943	So, it'll be fun to watch, and you'll see.
8574003	8578865	There's already a group of people, BomaniSims.com, that's sort of doing the similar thing.
8578925	8585968	I think they've beat me to it because they put their site up first, but the site looks like shit, and they don't really have that much right now, but...
8587248	8588690	Loki's drawing battle lines.
8588790	8593975	Yeah, we're going to see, wait until you see like a thousand files come online just all of a sudden.
8593995	8596777	So, you know, take that and whatever.
8597818	8599340	And stick it up your clit.
8599420	8599740	All right.
8600000	8602683	Oh my lord.
8602703	8605626	All right, we need to get to the cage match because we've got to get that done, definitely.
8605646	8607207	That's one segment we have to do each week.
8608308	8610650	Last week in the Orange Lounge cage match.
8612170	8618732	We had Ayumi Hamasaki won for the second week in a row with Connected, and I'll play a clip of that in the second verse.
8618752	8620392	I'm going to explain the cage match for you guys.
8620973	8634216	This is when we take three songs, we battle them against each other, you guys vote on your favorite, and the winner goes into rotation during the Bomani Music Amore program, which plays 24 hours a day on this station when we're not here.
8634697	8634897	So...
8636718	8638239	Let's hear a clip of last week's winner.
8638259	8641002	We're not going to play the full song, although you can still vote for it.
8641042	8645427	And if it does win this week, it gets retired next week as it will have won for a month straight.
8645948	8648651	This is Ayumi Hamasaki with Connected, last week's winner.
8700839	8703000	All right, that's Yumi Yamasaki with Connected.
8703461	8707083	That's your first candidate in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
8708984	8712206	Jamie, why don't you tell us about what you're going to bring into the Cage Match this week?
8712486	8714227	I don't remember who did it, but Pac-Man.
8715208	8715868	Zafx Twin.
8716368	8716729	Eat'em Up.
8717109	8717489	Eat'em Up.
8717549	8719010	This is Zafx Twin with Eat'em Up.
8719170	8722612	You're the second entry in tonight's Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
8724533	8725554	Insert Norian.
8735563	8739913	Batman, Batman, Batman, Batman, Batman,
8819173	8820174	Thanks for watching!
8888105	8889230	Ethan M, YamYam
8932160	8932881	I liked it 10.
8956147	8960431	It was like a really bad nightmare where I'm wandering through a KB Toys store.
8961471	8964354	And no, it's not from Ridge Racer Type 4.
8964634	8966175	It's a totally fucking different song.
8967276	8968077	Learn your music.
8968917	8971139	So, no, I didn't like it very much.
8971279	8976564	I mean, Apex Twins is really cool, but that song is just really repetitive and annoying.
8976904	8977584	So I'll give it a 4.
8981147	8984830	Yeah, um... I wasn't very fond of it.
8984850	8985491	It seemed to...
8986843	8989826	Yeah, Pacman apparently doesn't make good music.
8990767	8993950	Yes, I see both your middle fingers pointing in my direction, Jamie.
8994310	8995412	AND I DON'T CARE!
8998274	9001878	Ooh, I can wave first too!
9001938	9005582	Yeah, I give it a 5.
9006543	9008424	I just had a ferret hit me in the face.
9012489	9013110	Let's see the song.
9013130	9014512	I'll probably give it like an 8.5 out of 10.
9014612	9015693	It's a pretty good song.
9015713	9020940	It's a pretty good song, but for some reason, I still like Ayumi better for some reason.
9023078	9025260	This song is a pretty classic though.
9025280	9028362	They could have done a little better, but it's pretty good.
9028843	9032286	I give it a 7, because I think that's about the highest stage I ever got to on Pac-Man.
9032926	9036889	Alright, next up, Loki, tell us about the other song in the cage match.
9036909	9042073	The next one, you might remember her stuff from DDR Max 2, where she did the song Stay.
9042113	9043435	This is Test With Confusion.
9043475	9052142	Test With Confusion
9156580	9157840	and many more.
9230177	9232740	Oh, uh, whoa, hello, that's the wrong one, my bad.
9233120	9236683	Uh, that was Tess with Confusion.
9237704	9238725	Ah, what'd y'all think of that one?
9238906	9239726	Tess with Confusion.
9240347	9240827	On a scale of 1-10?
9246002	9251464	Which mic am I taking here?
9251784	9257406	Uh, I liked it, I mean... And no, I don't pick my songs from PrettyMix3, ass!
9257886	9261007	This is a full version, not a cut-down version!
9261467	9265008	But yes, I do pick my music files from my Askin collection.
9265368	9267009	So you were close, I give you half a point.
9267849	9269229	But uh, I'll give it a 9.
9269609	9274291	Uh, let's see, um, it was better than the Pac-Man song.
9274971	9280053	And Jamie's over here kicking me on the floor.
9281193	9281453	Yeah.
9281833	9282874	She's doing a little kick.
9283054	9283214	Ow.
9283414	9283554	Don't.
9283574	9285714	You're beating me up.
9286255	9287555	Um, yeah.
9287575	9288375	Uh, I'd give it an 8.5.
9288455	9291976	You need to do that more often.
9292977	9293997	I think this one's very good.
9294037	9296538	What, you like me kicking you?
9297798	9299319	The scores are probably good.
9299399	9299919	There's, uh...
9301054	9301454	9.0 out of 10!
9301574	9304255	You need to kick people more often, not me!
9304275	9309016	Shouldn't be a very good battle, but some p- And why did you- I don't know why I tested the music and everything so much.
9309036	9310616	Jimmy just took my hat off and put it on Rob.
9310696	9312336	I'll still prefer Ayumi for a while.
9313456	9314156	Ooh, Chick Fight.
9314176	9314237	TNA.
9314777	9315757	Bob Hattie!
9315817	9317537	What the hell are you talking about?
9317557	9319557	Tess versus, uh, Ayumi.
9321338	9322618	That was completely random.
9323398	9323978	Cage Match!
9325379	9327299	Hey, you have to put the Cage Match topic on the way.
9328323	9330884	Alright, I thought it was pretty groovy.
9331064	9333526	I also give that song a 7.
9336007	9340129	Okay, so anyway, you can vote for... You can send in your votes now.
9340249	9344351	Send them as a private message to me in the chatroom right now.
9345131	9348553	You can vote for Connected by Ayumi Hamasaki.
9349013	9353155	You can vote for Apex... I'm sorry, let me pull up the volume a little more.
9353175	9354936	You can vote for Ayumi Hamasaki with Connected.
9354976	9357257	You can vote for Apex Twin with Eat Em Up.
9359915	9361356	Or you can vote for Tess with confusion.
9368823	9370005	Alright, you send in those votes.
9370325	9372907	PM in the chat room right now to Sky, that's me.
9373628	9376451	Or you can send them an email.
9376591	9378953	OrangeLaunchRadio at Yahoo.com Alright.
9381098	9386519	So now, instead of going back to break since we just played some music, you have to send me PMs so they don't count.
9386579	9388920	Don't type them in the main channel because I don't count them there.
9389760	9394061	So, uh, explicit's giving a kick out of just reading you people in the chatroom.
9395621	9396661	Chatroom fun, you like that.
9396681	9397962	BlackHat, did you have something you wanted to say?
9397982	9400382	I have the microphone right now.
9400402	9402743	I figured you had something you wanted to say.
9402923	9403223	Why?
9403923	9405143	My hat does not look dumb.
9405163	9408104	Yeah, but the...
9410106	9411807	Ooh, I'm cool, because I wear my hat backwards.
9412367	9412588	Yeah.
9412848	9417331	Anyway, did we figure out if we can do our segment that we wanted to do?
9417351	9419992	Well, I can do it.
9420012	9423054	I mean, I've got... I can talk about something.
9423174	9423714	Okay, great.
9424355	9429538	Then we're going to talk about... We're going to introduce a new segment on this big show.
9430899	9431839	It's time, everybody.
9431919	9432440	Sit around.
9432580	9433440	Bring in the family.
9433801	9434921	Sit around to the radio.
9435722	9436782	Get the kids in.
9437243	9438884	Tuck them into bed, because it's time...
9439904	9440585	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9461361	9461801	Oh, Black Lab.
9461821	9462482	That was when he was here.
9462522	9462662	It was 20.
9463362	9465183	Okay, in episode 20, you talked about the Black Lab.
9465363	9468024	I didn't talk about the hooker who was named Black Lab.
9468044	9468824	She was black, though.
9470205	9472946	Anyway, so we thought we'd make a whole segment out of this in the future.
9473286	9476968	Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Story Time with Loki.
9480343	9484745	Alright, so, hold on, I'm sorry, I have to bring in your music, Loki.
9485005	9487446	So what are you going to be telling us the story about tonight?
9487606	9491768	Well, I'm going to be talking about the time that I went to Goth Night at the Rage in Sacramento.
9491788	9493108	It's a club that we've got down here.
9493668	9500331	And, you know, me kind of, you know, really I don't get out that much, but when I do it's just weird shit that happens.
9500711	9502432	So that's why we have, you know, story time.
9502512	9504773	So this is about, like, I went to Goth Night.
9505853	9506954	Let me introduce this, okay.
9507374	9507894	Okay.
9508374	9524354	Alright, so, before I was dating my girlfriend right now, um, I was dating this other girl, who, um, her name was Forrest, um, she was a, no, she was not Dark Black, well, well, I'm not gonna con, well, yeah, okay.
9524574	9527015	The forest was very thick, but that's not what we're going to talk about here.
9527356	9531458	Okay, so basically we were going out and she was turning into Jesus Freak that she is now.
9532378	9541344	So before that, I was talking with this one girl who used to, you know, she really had like a crush thing on me all throughout high school, and I just kind of ignored it, didn't really care.
9542024	9544726	But we were talking and stuff, and she wanted to go out to this club.
9545746	9547087	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9573045	9575946	Um, and, no, this girl was really hot.
9575986	9578567	I mean, she was, yeah, she was nice.
9578807	9583889	Um, so, we go there, um, you know, and I'm meeting all these weird people.
9584129	9595994	Um, there's this guy wearing a corset, and, you know, she was commenting on his corset and asking where he got it and that kind of thing.
9596394	9597295	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9619335	9644216	also gay, was, you know, kind of eyeing me up and shit, and so I was like, kind of, okay, what's going on here, and so they're, you know, they're talking, and then, I guess, Thomas goes and talks to his friend, and comes back, he's like, my friend has made an interesting proposition, and I think you'd like to hear it, I'm like, okay, he wants to know if you'd be willing to go home with him tonight, I'm like,
9645307	9646228	Hell no!
9646648	9647669	No way!
9647749	9655516	Sorry, don't swing, no wait, and he's all, no really, it's, uh, then, you know, Thomas is like, no really, it's good, no, I've done it before, I'm like, no!
9656317	9657538	And no, no.
9658138	9660400	So basically she was like acting like my pimp that night.
9661281	9661782	I don't know.
9661902	9662502	It was kind of weird.
9662742	9664804	It was kind of cool, though, because she's hanging out with me.
9665124	9670609	She's really like into, you know, the kind of... She was an exotic dancer once, okay?
9671049	9675332	And it was really sweet because she had piercings in all the right places.
9675913	9677094	Except she wouldn't pierce the boys.
9677154	9680516	She didn't want to, you know, pierce their nipples, but she had piercings in other places.
9680877	9683078	I kept trying to get her to show me her piercings, but she wouldn't.
9683158	9683839	She was kind of shy.
9684039	9686881	She also used to... She had pictures, too, but... A super shy...
9688576	9689697	I know, I know.
9690137	9699503	But anyways, um, so she also had pictures of her, she's taking pictures, like, with, um, her just wearing caution tape, and then the caution tape being heated up a little bit so that it's form-fitting.
9700204	9702826	I wanted to see that, that was kind of cool, but, um, no.
9703866	9707729	Let's see, other than that, um, I don't know, this story kind of sucks.
9707769	9716875	I had some really last night that was funny, and this is why we were in this whole segment, but unfortunately I didn't record what I wanted, you know, to actually talk about, you know, today.
9717355	9718176	Let's see here.
9718796	9721077	I could do another strip club story.
9725740	9727781	Okay.
9728561	9730322	Alright, well, real quick strip club story.
9730622	9732743	Now, there's some strippers that really, like, kind of scare me.
9733664	9734904	There's this one chick, you know.
9735284	9737766	She comes up, I'm at the, you know, the bar there.
9737786	9739547	You've got my dollar bills down shit.
9739587	9741828	She comes to, you know, rub her tits in my face.
9741948	9742928	And, you know, that's kind of cool.
9743428	9746350	But when she does it, though, she's like, Boobie, boobie, boobie, boobie, boobies!
9746590	9747551	That scared the shit out of me.
9747591	9749471	I was like, I wasn't prepared for that shit.
9749532	9751953	I was like, come on, what the fuck?
9752333	9755535	It was with the most annoying, high-pitched voice that you could ever imagine.
9756055	9759597	Do you want to hear the most annoying shout in the world?
9768542	9770824	Anyways, so yeah, that was scary.
9773386	9777990	We're going to be doing another strip club trip, though, pretty soon, though, because my friend's getting married, and I know he's going to be throwing a bachelor party.
9778030	9779271	Plus, next week we're talking about going.
9779592	9780893	My girlfriend's going to a strip club.
9781233	9791221	She's going to a strip club at the end of the month with her friends, and supposedly at Centerfolds, I guess they do full nude strip clubs for guys stripping full nude.
9791702	9792543	I never knew that.
9793663	9796805	You gotta get tickets in advance though, so it's $8 to go in.
9797105	9804610	But she's going with her friend and a couple of her friends and they're going to do that and they're going to buy each other lap dances.
9804770	9806291	So it's kind of cool.
9806611	9809012	But I want to definitely hit up the strip club again because it's fun.
9810313	9814095	Yeah, Centerfolds, they have actually, Gold Club Centerfolds, they've got their own actual forums.
9814115	9815836	It's kind of funny watching people post in there.
9817457	9819339	I went to the Gold Club Center full forms the other day.
9819379	9820019	I don't remember why.
9820039	9821501	I was talking to a friend online about them.
9822121	9824423	And, um, yeah, they were interesting stuff.
9824903	9825203	That's all.
9826204	9827065	Yeah.
9827085	9829186	Um, there was, oh, the shower room.
9829527	9831248	Do you ever go to a freaking strip club?
9831488	9833530	Okay, and they've got a shower room, the shower dances.
9834410	9835411	Check it out, okay?
9835731	9840215	We went there and we got to see, because there was this really hot chick that came up to me and my friend, um, Eric.
9840515	9842796	We were going to actually go, you know, get lap dances from this.
9842917	9844478	Oh my gosh, it's so fucking hot.
9844978	9847641	So anyways, instead, they're all like, we have an interesting proposition.
9847901	9855608	How about you guys join this bachelor party right here for a shower dance, and, um, you know, it'll cost you half as much in each, you know, to go in there.
9855648	9856789	So I was like, okay, yeah, we'll do that.
9857229	9862594	So we go in there, and basically what the shower room is, it's like this kind of large communal shower thing.
9862855	9870582	They've got these two chicks, you know, totally naked in there, and they've got, um, their sprayed whipped cream, or not, yeah, like shaving cream all over their bodies.
9871102	9878244	Well, the showroom, what you can do is, you can put dollar bills in your hand, and you can basically touch them all over their body wherever you want.
9878564	9889428	Well, with, and so you get, as long as you have a dollar bill in your hand, you can keep, you know, putting dollars on them and stuff, and then they started getting a little bit more freakier, and then they started, you know, going down on each other and shit in there.
9889768	9893609	I mean, I didn't know this kind of stuff happened in strip clubs, but I guess it does.
9893689	9897670	And then they had, um, if you paid $20, they would sit on your face.
9898011	9898811	But you just had to keep...
9907741	9910464	But you just have to keep your mouth shut, so, you know.
9913507	9916411	So, I guess they look for the people with really big noses.
9917867	9919168	Look, I'm going there!
9921349	9923470	So, yeah, it was very interesting.
9923490	9931834	The only thing I regret is because it was such a large group, I couldn't really get to the front of the line to put dollar bills on naked chicks' breasts.
9931894	9933775	But it was fun while it lasted.
9933815	9935956	I don't know, it was interesting.
9936176	9943700	You know, I'm getting so in trouble for this because the last time that I talked about weird shit like this, my girlfriend was bored and decided to listen to this show.
9944440	9944520	And...
9946261	9946841	I love you!
9946861	9948162	If you're listening.
9948642	9951884	Yeah, she does a lot of this weird shit that we've done.
9951984	9957526	I mean, at least I'm not like my friends who go and get, you know, the VIP room dances and get head in there.
9957747	9965210	I mean, so... Okay, for all the people that are visiting Rancho Cordova, this is Gold Club Centerfolds off of Folsom Boulevard.
9965290	9965870	Do check it out.
9965890	9968492	Yeah, that's all.
9968572	9969032	That's my story.
9971630	9972530	I like cheese.
9973750	9974951	I need to play Animal Crossing.
9978091	9981092	I'm gonna have to do some more interesting, weird shit in order to come up with stories.
9981232	9982952	Or start digging back into my past.
9983112	9987253	Because I've done a lot of awkward, weird shit before, and I'm sure, you know, it'll come up.
9988373	9988853	Well, you know what?
9988873	9990493	For next week, that's your homework, you know?
9990753	9993034	Go find a funny story in your life and write it down.
9994394	9995854	I'm gonna start a PayPal account.
9995874	9998195	It's Loki's GoToStripClipFun account.
9999595	10000535	You never know, it might work.
10001502	10003643	Jamie, you want to announce the winner of this week's cage match?
10005143	10006124	Um, here's a quarter, Matt.
10006324	10008665	Woohoo!
10009585	10011966	First donation to your strip club needs.
10014087	10014507	Okay.
10016388	10017508	And, guess what?
10017528	10019229	Fuck everybody because I win.
10019769	10022010	That's because you, uh, everyone's whipped to Jamie.
10022750	10024031	It's because you all love me.
10024831	10027812	Yeah, it's probably all the people that listen to our FD shows all the time.
10027832	10029213	You're all nerds like me.
10030546	10031568	and the winner is me!
10032309	10034213	Oh, I'm sorry, Aphex from Pac-Man.
10034293	10034894	Eat him up.
10036958	10038020	Yeah, because I'm cool.
10038721	10040664	Bless all of you people who are old school like me.
10047173	10055456	Don't do that again!
10055636	10062858	Okay, we're going to take a really quick break, like one or two song break.
10062878	10065199	We're going to come back to wrap up this big train wreck of a show.
10065559	10066819	So stay with us, won't you?
10066979	10067820	Won't you be my neighbor?
10069680	10070540	And we'll be back.
10073420	10075605	Listen to Burp, that was the reverse of a burp.
10075705	10077529	Let's do... Wait, I want to play something.
10077549	10078291	Can we play one of mine?
10078511	10080476	Yes, I'll start with this song and then we'll do one of yours, okay?
10080756	10081057	Okay.
10081077	10081378	Be right back.
10135805	10138048	Thank you for watching!
10163971	10167113	Loki's going to introduce this next song for us, because it's special.
10167733	10168073	Okay.
10168213	10168833	Special, Ed.
10169334	10182580	For all those people out there that are thinking, gee, it would be a really great idea to mix Max 300 with the name of a Bomani song, or any song that's in the whole Bomani series, here's why you shouldn't do that.
10184061	10186942	Is this going to sound like a... Never mind, I'm not going to say it on air.
10189003	10189423	Max 300.
10203687	10204050	Max, 300 years
10232553	10233153	Are you ready?
10233173	10233274	Go!
10286830	10290973	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
10291214	10292915	Do you want to be staffed by Hollywood?
10292975	10293315	No!
10295717	10297078	Do we care what people think of us?
10297699	10299580	No!
10299600	10301021	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
10301482	10302442	Yes!
10305553	10316656	Extreme Bombani Radio That's us, Orange Lounge Radio Dot, dot, dot Jamie's twitching, she went into a coma, that song killed her
10318737	10322741	Let's just say that song fucking sucks.
10322761	10323622	We're going to remix this.
10323642	10324863	DJ have some lessons a little bit.
10325103	10327245	I could just remix better than them.
10327265	10328066	I have had a cry.
10328787	10333131	See, how much of his life is worse than Max Dinosaur?
10333511	10337955	It sounded, it sounded, you know what it sounded like?
10338456	10338816	Burning?
10339136	10339657	A twin mix.
10341132	10343993	Well, actually, later on... Zing for that one!
10344613	10346453	I've got something else that you guys might like.
10346473	10348974	But anyways, that was a late entry in Tourney Mix 3.
10349154	10354775	This is all the shit that was cluttering up, you know, the song list that... The reason my entry didn't get played.
10355715	10358336	I should have put my entry as name of the game, Max 300.
10358376	10360016	And then people would be like, Oh, Max 300!
10360357	10360997	I'm gonna play that!
10361017	10366218	You know, so... Freaking A. Okay, let me calm down for a second.
10367165	10370446	But yeah, there's a bunch of horrible shit out there.
10372126	10374146	Healing Era is a good example.
10374786	10380567	I've got another one that's Max 300, the positive reversal remix.
10380627	10382128	It's Max 300 backwards.
10382408	10383188	It's really shitty.
10383728	10387608	And then there's another one that's, we might be playing later, Max Doctor.
10388629	10389389	Oh, what the hell?
10389409	10390809	Hell no, hell no, hell no.
10390929	10393409	Alright, fine, no Max Doctor.
10393429	10396450	I'm going to remit into the lounge soon.
10397369	10401610	But, yeah, well, I've got some more stuff, though.
10401830	10403130	Plenty of horrible sound files.
10403531	10405791	That was very homoerotic, though, that song.
10407131	10413153	I would like to state, Paula Terry, I believe, has been banned from Orange Lounge for a little while, although her good songs we accept.
10413193	10417454	We let them through, like, you know, Memories and Email Me.
10417754	10418374	We let those through.
10418994	10420595	I don't know, there was another one that we let through.
10420615	10421135	I thought it was out.
10421435	10425576	Anyway, but that song, that song's banned for ten years from Orange Lounge Radio.
10425996	10429379	Let's just ban all Max 300, anything with Max 300 in it.
10429459	10435525	Okay, anything that is not Konami produced with Max in the title is now banned from this station.
10435806	10436266	Word.
10436466	10441631	No, any Max that sucks, because there's some pretty good Max files, but Max Dinosaur...
10442972	10444233	I thought of another one that's actually okay.
10444253	10444734	PianoMax Unlimited.
10444754	10445554	That was cool.
10445574	10445854	Oh, yeah.
10445915	10446135	That was...
10471932	10475174	No, that right there was STM.
10475214	10486040	He was the guy that actually... A long time ago... Now, if you remember, you know how they have that musician's trial thing right now for 2DX9th style or whatever?
10486440	10491323	They did a similar thing back in the day for 4th style, and they also did it for 5th mix.
10491823	10494925	5th mix, the winner of it was Paranoia Eternal, and that was done by STM.
10495365	10499407	STM did another, he has a bunch of music files he's done.
10499427	10509773	In fact, Virtue, Corey, released, what was it, there was a Trip Machine Strange Mix that was floating around the net and people thought it was Trip Machine Survivor.
10510533	10511354	That was hilarious.
10511914	10517978	And so that was going around, but that was actually a remix done by that guy, STM.
10518038	10523120	And he actually, you know, he was one of the lucky ones that actually got an actual song in DDR.
10523140	10523521	They had the...
10524701	10528424	Yeah, it's in Extreme now, so go play his remix, and it's actually pretty good.
10528464	10532808	So, yeah, definitely check out his stuff.
10533188	10536010	I'm sure someone's got a link to his stuff out there.
10536070	10536891	I mean, I know.
10537531	10538552	I've got all of his songs.
10538632	10543356	There's one, like Rob was mentioning, that's a piano ambient version of Max 300.
10543396	10547659	I forget what it's called offhand, but it's really good.
10549221	10549601	But, yeah.
10552287	10554269	I don't know what song was worse, that or bag.
10557793	10559936	Maybe we'll do a cage match for that next week.
10560336	10563580	Worst, like the cage worst or something, I don't know.
10565001	10571168	We should do one where only one song survives and the rest get dumped off the playlist.
10572369	10572690	Alright.
10574207	10588798	What we could do is we'll have a cage match tournament of all the worst songs, and all the songs except for the winner will get put onto a CD, and then we'll destroy the CD in some net glorious way.
10590379	10591440	I know what would win the losing.
10592240	10592741	Let them move.
10593922	10594682	No, no, no.
10595082	10596403	What do you mean, win the losing?
10596544	10598025	Max for you.
10598165	10598785	Max for you.
10600650	10601251	But, yeah.
10605415	10616487	Um, see, uh, I've... There's actually, there's some other really cool non-of... Well, there's some, a bunch of Omani remixes, actually, that are out there that are official, um, on DanceMania and stuff.
10616527	10618389	Like, there's one that I've got on my CD here.
10618869	10620892	It's, um, Candy the Planet remix.
10621612	10622713	It's kind of a, um...
10623354	10629281	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10642628	10643669	Yeah, it was on speed 8.
10643849	10646712	And then, um... Oh, there's a bunch of stuff out there.
10647753	10650436	But yeah, there's a lot of files that really suck.
10651818	10655842	I've got a Let Them Move remix on that CD that's really, really bad.
10657183	10658825	Imagine Let Them Move MX-300 mixed together.
10660558	10661099	It's been done.
10662761	10665084	There's this guy, Twin, who used to be in our chat room.
10665946	10668089	He used to do... Bye, Dave.
10668269	10669090	Final thought, Dave.
10669330	10669791	Final thought.
10670272	10670933	Final thought.
10672635	10673917	I need to play DDR Extreme.
10674337	10677542	And I will pass V. Remember, not at Roosevelt Gotham.
10680532	10683913	Okay, finish up your sentence, Loki, and then I've got to get everybody's final thoughts.
10684013	10684314	I'm done.
10684354	10684794	We're about done.
10684874	10685214	Oh, okay.
10685594	10687535	All right, then, let's start with the final thoughts of the day.
10687555	10689696	First, our guests, let's talk to Explicit.
10689736	10690636	What's your final thought of the day?
10691276	10695118	The final thought of the day is, for RPGL, fix your damn machines.
10695678	10696518	Come on, now.
10697559	10701540	And for the people who are going to attempt remixing on Macs, please make it good.
10702861	10703341	Thank you.
10704101	10708483	The one that was just played a while ago, they'd be good in the bathroom so badly.
10710191	10712993	Well, that's like one of the worst songs ever, I can think of.
10715715	10717636	Or just get some damn lessons, or something.
10718157	10724982	And end up with a Vox Alacla, or Max For You, or whatever the damn people are talking about on the internet.
10726563	10729565	Unless it's very good, you can give it to me and I'll see, I'll rate it.
10732227	10735549	And Scania should get the New York stream soon.
10736430	10739032	It's on its way, and I can't wait till it comes.
10739946	10741629	Alright, Black Lab, final thought.
10742690	10744433	Derby Owner's Club is my new crack.
10745655	10749701	I have to go play it next time I go back to the Bay Area, which hopefully will be soon.
10750563	10752766	But now I gotta get a job so I can blow money on DOC.
10753247	10753647	I'm sad.
10754847	10755907	You could blow, so you can blow.
10757047	10757407	No!
10758608	10760688	I... Don't bring that up again!
10761608	10762048	Again?
10764669	10765329	Brad, final thought.
10765569	10767049	All your fried chicken are blowing to me.
10768349	10769249	Brad made me eat corn.
10769270	10770390	Does Irene have a final thought?
10771730	10772750	It's fine, I only had a little.
10773490	10774070	I want another one.
10775010	10775631	Wait a minute!
10775651	10777091	If you're allergic to corn, why eat more?
10777551	10777811	Alright.
10778171	10778571	I won't die.
10779811	10781652	Um, let's see.
10782392	10783552	Loki, your final thought of the day.
10785407	10787628	My throat hurts from all this yelling and screaming.
10787668	10790789	I can't be, like, enthusiastic and stuff.
10790849	10795130	Especially with this stupid, you know, science... Why?
10795271	10796331	I hate the world!
10797851	10802973	You know, if people would stop being stupid and start dying, the world would be a better place.
10803073	10804294	I feel the conflict within you.
10804314	10804974	Let go of your hate.
10806977	10810660	You know, that's one of the reasons I don't get drunk, is because I'm afraid I'm going to get violent.
10810720	10816465	I mean, what if the actual inhibitions I have is from killing people, and then that goes away?
10816725	10820648	Then I would wake up out of a drunken stupor and see a bunch of bodies and blood everywhere.
10820848	10821669	Wouldn't that be frightening?
10822289	10823170	I just hug people.
10823590	10825312	I turn into the absolute opposite when I'm drunk.
10825992	10830736	Instead of being all angsty and violent and everything, I can start loving everybody and wanting to hug everybody I see.
10831553	10832174	Have you noticed that?
10832314	10847005	And DDRLlama, or if anyone has contacts with DDRLlama right now, please set up my uploading script, because I'm waiting on you to finish it, and you said you'd do it like three days ago, and you haven't, and it's really frustrating, because I need to upload my site and get it done!
10847885	10848486	Were you whining?
10849647	10849947	No!
10851908	10852329	Anyways.
10852609	10853029	I'm done.
10853049	10853309	Um, go.
10853329	10853750	I get to be last.
10860006	10868132	My final thought of the day is... Yeah, we're running long and I'm not helping because I can't think of a final thought.
10870994	10879241	Oh, my final thought... As the old cheerleaders from Saturday Night Live said, sex can wait, masturbate.
10880361	10880642	Jamie?
10881863	10887667	My final thought of the day is I'm going to have boba and you have to stay tuned for the afterbirth.
10889844	10891284	Alright, bye guys!
