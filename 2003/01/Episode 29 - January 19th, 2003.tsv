1932	2813	Message for you, son.
3253	4174	Attention!
5115	8997	Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
10618	15662	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
19310	22211	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
22551	25731	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
26292	29012	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
29552	32453	Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
33233	33653	Just kidding.
33853	35433	Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
35653	43075	In this episode... Hey, any balls down there?
43375	45836	That's the biggest fairy you ever seen, Tinkle Fairy.
45916	47656	What's your favorite scary movie?
49093	49674	Showgirls.
50574	51735	Absolute fright.
51995	52776	What's yours?
52796	55278	There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
55338	56539	Don't torture yourself.
57240	58000	That's my job.
58161	59962	Now's the time our sprockets bang me dogs!
60042	63125	I'll get you, my pretty.
63325	64666	And your little dog, too.
65066	65947	I know Kung Fu.
66347	68949	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
68989	70851	Why did they have to take the word gang?
72452	75054	No one expects a punishing position.
75355	76696	It's end of age!
78991	85756	DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio We are live and this is episode number 29 for January 19th of 2003.
104491	112853	You're tuned in to the B-Money Scene's most drunken radio station of all things B-Money.
113453	114374	My name is Rob Roberts.
114494	115494	You might know me as Sky.
116254	120415	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.
123776	124656	No, that was last week.
124776	126897	You know her better as DarkSakura.
128937	131118	In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.
131938	132158	Hello.
133986	137210	And with us tonight will be some special guests joining us a little bit later.
137290	138212	There's nobody else here yet.
138272	139093	It's just the three of us.
139193	139894	Feelin' the love.
142233	143033	We don't have a Dave yet.
143533	146614	Yeah, we don't have a Dave here yet, and my drinking partner isn't here yet.
147274	149074	Yes, the rumor... I can't drink.
149094	149934	The rumors are true.
150134	154975	We're going to be doing some drinking on the show tonight, except, unfortunately, Jamie's not going to be able to drink.
155435	159736	I mean, I have no doubt that I'd be able to drink excessive amounts and have it not affect my ability.
160456	161897	Even so, I'm not a major idiot.
162797	169438	So, because I have a neat little thing outside that will prevent me from driving, which I'll tell everyone about later.
170078	176143	Alright, yeah, we'll talk a little bit more about... We'll talk a little bit more about the drinking when we come back from our first break.
176864	179006	I will play you some Initial D music during this break.
180447	182508	We'll also play some Guacamole Del Taco.
182729	183469	How's that sound?
184050	186071	And some other stuff, too.
186812	191416	So... Any other opening thoughts?
192016	192317	Alright.
192977	194118	We'll be back in a little bit.
194779	195039	Enjoy.
389362	389923	DarkSakura
437230	438150	Thank you for watching!
475096	489460	Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
489500	495142	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
495990	496870	Howdy ho, kids.
496930	499712	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
501393	507376	And as we mentioned last week, some of us have a... Well, I guess maybe I'm the only one that has a three-day weekend this week.
508316	510157	My company celebrates Martin Luther King Jr.
510137	511478	's birthday, so I don't have to work tomorrow.
511718	511978	Bitch.
512698	513619	So, I'm sorry.
513779	515960	Hey, it ain't my fault my company rules, and yours sucks.
516700	517421	Mine feeds us.
517441	521563	Mine caters Chevys and... Yeah, you get barbecues.
521623	523904	We don't get shit, so shut it, lady.
525734	528836	But we decided that we would do some drinking tonight.
529376	533238	Except I'm really the only one that's able to drink because Jamie has to work tomorrow.
533418	535500	And you want to tell everybody your big news?
535520	538161	Okay, first of all, I don't get hangovers, so I could drink.
538461	539102	Alright, alright.
539122	539462	Okay?
540122	540482	I do.
540702	542283	I'm a lightweight, as you're going to find out tonight.
542303	545125	You have seen how drunk I have gotten, and I've never had a hangover yet.
546635	548356	I have a car, and it owns all of you.
548636	549876	Yay!
550356	556078	It's the Seafoam Aquamarini Blue Chicky Color 93 Toyota Tercel 2-door.
556098	556778	It's a DX.
556818	558159	I'm going to have a 2 added before it.
558759	566662	Anyway, but it's black inside, and it has a CD player, so I instantly went and burned off CDs of Eurobeat.
567542	570923	But my car is, like, awesome, but since I drove over here...
571563	575166	Actually, I gave up going to the con just so I could drive my car.
576587	578329	Because my car made me feel happy.
578969	579850	Jamie got a car.
582225	586047	And because I'm driving tonight, I'm not going to be doing any drinking.
586548	590430	However, because we've got three hours, I'm going to do a shot.
590470	591331	In honor of the night.
591351	593072	We're going to do one shot together.
593432	595553	By then, I will have peed it out or whatever.
595793	600876	Now, we have to tell everybody, because we're radio hosts, drink responsibly.
600916	602777	We're being smart in how we're drinking here.
603558	607240	The show's done out of the spare bedroom of my house, so I don't have to go anywhere.
607260	609962	I'm chasing my suntan oil with Propel.
610464	612412	Jamie's gonna be letting it wear off.
612432	613235	She's gonna do her one shot.
613255	614198	Loki's not drinking at all.
614259	615082	He's gonna babysit.
615985	616286	Yeah.
617330	621453	and then Brad and Irene will be here in a little while and Brad's going to drink too and Irene is his driver.
621693	623835	I'm expecting that Rob's going to eventually assault Brad.
624075	626917	Brad and I are the... Assault him with what?
627698	628198	My cock?
629139	629539	Yes!
629780	630200	Yes!
631721	633903	If you will drink... Excuse me while I whip this out.
634964	635264	Anyway.
635624	636445	Okay, so here we go.
637526	638066	A toast.
638206	641409	Now I've never taken Malibu rum just straight up.
641469	642209	I always mix it with something.
642229	642730	I've never had it at all.
642750	643790	This is pretty bad.
643850	644211	Okay, here we go.
647526	648347	Dude, that was weak.
648627	648807	Oh.
650709	651370	Very coconutty.
651390	651950	That was it?
652250	653231	Yeah, it was kind of weak, wasn't it?
653552	654132	It was really weak.
654352	655133	It's something you mix.
656194	657876	Oh, it kind of burns.
658076	658436	It's yummy.
658456	659277	It tastes like burning.
659317	660158	It doesn't burn to me.
660278	662920	It tastes like burning.
663040	665242	I swear, now I know what suntan oil tastes like.
665783	666904	Oh, God.
667665	668786	Yeah.
668806	670127	That left the nastiest aftertaste.
670167	670707	Yes, please.
670727	672169	That left the nastiest aftertaste.
672709	673310	I thought it was okay.
675015	675575	Ooh!
675595	676316	Stuff was weak.
676336	679578	You're about to find out I'm a fucking lightweight, by the way, too.
679638	680399	How many, how many, what?
680419	681019	Where's the bottle?
681439	682120	The bottle of what?
682440	682860	Malibu?
682880	683241	Yeah.
683641	683901	Over here.
685162	688964	I've done shots of rum, but... 21%?
690686	692907	Okay, excuse me, that tastes like five.
692927	694828	It's like drinking a wine cooler.
695669	697790	Dude, I bet this would be really yummy with vanilla Coke.
698771	699391	I bet it would, too.
699732	702854	Let's do that, um, I think I got President's Day off.
703539	705200	Okay, I don't have President's Day off.
705420	705820	Bitch.
706800	707901	I might be able to take it off.
707941	708361	We'll see.
708381	709221	Take off President's Day.
709261	709481	Alright.
709942	710502	I'll drink with you.
710522	711702	I'm going to do a floating holiday.
711902	712123	Anyway.
713383	715804	Oh yeah, hi, we're a Bomani Talk radio show, aren't we?
716304	716905	Yeah.
717025	717745	What's new, you guys?
717785	718345	How was your week?
718705	719446	What'd you do this week?
719466	720866	I think my insides are getting a tan.
722707	723787	Your insides are getting a tan?
723867	724087	Yeah.
724107	724368	How?
724428	727589	In your big fluorescent light.
728149	728629	Or whatever.
728709	728829	Okay.
732677	733258	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
752734	753434	What happened with that?
753935	765201	Konami released, or actually, Bomani Cell said that someone hacked the code, and then later on, about, I don't know, about five minutes later, someone's like, oh yeah, Konami just faxed in the code, you know, to all the arcades.
765581	766962	Oops, I guess they didn't hack the code.
767002	772405	Anyways, so there's a code out there now that's for three Oni courses and three non-stop courses.
772925	777528	I got to play the one non-stop course the other day with Twinbee in it, and that was pretty fun.
779549	781710	Other than that... Will Twin be a playable song normally?
782270	786251	It will be.
787531	788452	I'll play that for a dollar.
789892	792773	And so, yeah, that'll be coming up.
792833	798475	And then there's the Guitar Freaks Drum Mania Oni Chorus with at least 100 seconds and Across the Nightmare in it.
798915	799795	So that's kind of cool.
800255	806497	And other than that, we've also been having slight problems with the machine lately.
807397	810779	And the problems are that the machine keeps freezing up during the middle of songs.
810959	812380	Max 2 did that same shit though, didn't it?
812921	816423	Where like after you play a certain set of songs, like one of the internet rankings?
816443	818244	No, this has nothing to do with internet rankings.
818284	819484	That was a glitch in the whole thing.
819524	821506	This has to do with like a smudge on the CD.
821766	824948	Meaning you'll play a song and all of a sudden, boom, it'll freeze up.
824968	830691	And I don't know if it's a smudge on the CD because if that were the case, the music would skip because the music's on the CD.
831011	833753	But what happens is the music keeps going, the steps freeze.
835126	835466	Yikes.
835946	843430	So that's a pretty nasty bug there, and they're going to be hopefully reinstalling it all on Monday, and hopefully that'll fix the problem.
844410	848772	I wonder if that's happening in other places, or if it's just specific to our local arcade.
850913	851554	JB told me that.
851614	852074	It happened to him.
853214	853555	Dope.
854875	856156	So, yeah, I don't know.
857795	861897	Other than that, I got yet another bonus from my company.
863717	863997	Another $800.
864277	866878	Are you going to buy your machine yet?
867118	868059	No, I'm not buying my machine.
868119	869679	I'm paying off my credit card.
870079	873321	Paying off my credit card and getting my savings account where it should be.
874261	876822	And so, you know, hopefully...
878303	880925	Remember the issue with the 6 sound, 7 sound videos?
908010	908811	Oh yeah, that's right.
910071	914434	So, that kind of sucks, but it happens every now and then.
915075	915695	It's no big deal.
915735	919338	But other than that, with my money, I went and bought a GameCube.
919838	922740	And with that GameCube, I also got Animal Crossing.
922860	923640	Yay!
923721	925762	Welcome to the crack world addiction.
925782	931686	So now I've joined the cult of Animal Crossing in my wonderfully named town of Big Cock.
933536	934937	It was my girlfriend's idea, okay?
935318	935838	Not mine.
936198	936659	Oh my.
937079	943424	We were thinking of something to name it, and it was funny, so we named it Big Cock, and it makes for some really funny dialogue.
943444	946667	If you two have a baby, you know, five years down the road, you gonna name your baby Big Cock?
948208	948509	No.
950671	955294	But, um, yeah, so that's the name of our town, and it's pretty cool.
955895	956696	Pearl's a bitch.
957316	957957	Yeah, she is.
959318	960419	I got pushed, you left our town.
961016	965938	So I don't like her, and yeah, so that's what I've been playing, playing Animal Crossing.
966478	973441	Oh, and another thing I found out, I finished testing my DDR Max 2 edit machine code thing.
973661	988348	Apparently the number is not a pattern at all, and it's randomly generated, so no, I'm not going to test all 16,000 combinations, because that would take forever, and it would be a waste of my time, and it's coming out in April, so what do I give a shit about that, so...
991055	994067	But I'm sure that'll be news we'll be giving out later.
994087	994629	Yes.
996316	996858	I'm sorry, Jamie?
997495	999797	April is when my birthday is and someone could buy me something.
1000377	1004199	Yes, Max 2 for the Japanese system is coming out April.
1004940	1006481	And, of course, the U.S.
1006561	1008402	version is coming out around November.
1008422	1010804	A little bit delayed.
1010964	1011564	It's a little late.
1011944	1013546	Just like DDR USA.
1013606	1014126	A late birth.
1015487	1016968	You'll hear it here first.
1017008	1019249	This is a few of the tracks that are going to be in there.
1020330	1020610	Okay.
1021010	1021431	You've got...
1022392	1023833	Now, how do you know this, Mr. Man?
1023953	1024533	How do I know this?
1024573	1025934	Well, because they're done already.
1026154	1031596	They were going to be in DDR Max USA, but they were like, no, we're going to cut it out and, you know, wait, put them in the next one.
1031896	1032177	All right.
1032197	1039120	So, we've got Nemesis, Keep On Liftin', and, um, uh, that's a weird name going from Six Style.
1039600	1040280	Big Black Cop.
1040500	1041261	No, it's not Big Black Cop.
1041281	1041761	Speed Mix.
1042561	1043822	Um, that's it.
1045785	1048590	M-2 Step 101 or something like that.
1049311	1052496	And if they're not in Max 2, then you never heard it here.
1053397	1055661	And if they don't end up in Max 2, you never heard it here.
1055761	1056663	You didn't say anything about it.
1059639	1079730	but Max Japan, I bet you anything Max Japan's going to have that, Max 2 Japan will have that Drop the Bomb remix as an unlocked track and what else, it's going to have, because you know how you can, yes, the Dynamite Rave remix, thank you Jimmy, because you know how you can sort the list in Xtreme by...
1081711	1086333	Game, you can see that there's the one that songs from Holmes versions.
1086813	1092696	Well, they have like the Drop the Bomb mix in there, and they have the Dynamite Rave one in there, but they don't have the True Colors mix.
1092756	1093676	That's because it's unlockable.
1093996	1094356	Oh, is it?
1094616	1095737	It's unlockable.
1095997	1097397	Dynamite Rave's not in there yet either.
1097717	1099218	Oh, well shit, I'll be damned.
1099518	1103741	And the only one, Do It Right, the two-step version is going to be in there.
1104262	1109045	But since those are all supposedly home version Unlocked songs, that would mean they need to be in a Japanese home release.
1109085	1110967	So, I bet we'll be seeing those in Max 2 Japan.
1110987	1111567	Probably.
1112008	1113048	Well, not necessarily, though.
1113569	1117992	Because, look at AM3P303 Bass Mix.
1118012	1118933	That's not in there yet.
1119713	1120214	But it might.
1120254	1121094	That might be another one.
1121475	1121595	Ah!
1122135	1122255	Ah!
1123176	1124077	But, you know...
1124777	1125237	I don't know.
1125557	1129319	I hope they release something new instead of all this rehashed shit, you know.
1129679	1130920	Yeah, I want to see some new shit, too.
1133361	1134001	Go to the bathroom.
1135082	1135562	Gross!
1137984	1142145	Okay, what's new in the sim world, Loki, as long as we're talking to you in the start of this show here?
1142505	1148827	Um, just, uh, well, other than my site coming up next week, yeah, I know it was supposed to be this week, but we ran into script issues with there.
1148887	1150528	Yeah, right, you were playing Animal Crossing all week.
1150668	1155409	No, I wasn't, so we ran into problems with that, and, um, it should be coming up next week.
1155769	1163751	Although, I don't know, I'm debating because our tech people at work are going through all of our computers and deleting all non-30 party stuff.
1163791	1166632	And I have all my stuff hidden, but he hasn't quite gotten to my computer yet.
1167152	1173673	So I have to wait for him to come by and supposedly delete everything so I can reinstall everything and then get back to what I was doing.
1174313	1176774	But I have to wait for that to happen before I can, you know...
1177441	1192431	I don't know, I could probably upload everything right away, but they're just being super anal because our HR department thinks for some reason that background screensavers and other stuff like that cause viruses because they're dumbasses and don't know shit about computers.
1194688	1198492	So, yeah, hopefully everything should be coming up.
1198733	1200474	The site's already sort of up right now.
1200514	1205500	I mean, you can email me to, you know, get your account set up so you can upload shit.
1205540	1214049	But it's going to be www.willddrforfood.net slash leechfromloki.
1216064	1217225	DanSenseRevolution, Paranoia Survivor Max
1235020	1237401	Other than that, also check out Bomani Sims.
1237422	1245447	You'll see a lot of stuff that other people are releasing on there if you've missed it on, say, DDR Mania X, which is also down right now, but the forums are still working.
1246448	1249130	DDR East Coast Invasion I haven't looked at today.
1249811	1251112	I don't think anything's going on there.
1251912	1253633	And that's pretty much it.
1254154	1254654	Not too much.
1256696	1256976	But yeah.
1259232	1262434	Okay, while Loki was telling us about what's going on in the Bomani world.
1262454	1265755	I was about to do a shot of this stuff that looks like wall touch.
1265796	1267436	Jamie was sitting there going, I'm hot.
1268837	1272999	And she wasn't talking about, you know, just like, oh damn, you know, I got it, I'm sexy.
1273039	1274220	I'm too sexy for this show.
1274840	1275781	She's not saying anything to do with it.
1276661	1277501	I was feeling her face.
1277641	1280402	She is indeed a little hot from that shot.
1281402	1287244	I always get warm with my fresh... Put the thermometer against your face and see what you measure.
1287324	1287584	This one?
1287924	1290185	Yeah.
1290985	1291825	I feel retarded.
1292826	1293626	You look retarded.
1293666	1294126	It's okay.
1294486	1294686	Here.
1294886	1296207	Oh, but it feels nice because I'm hot.
1296327	1297067	It's really cold.
1297607	1298688	God damn it, Rob.
1298728	1300408	These things burn at a thousand degrees.
1300468	1301449	I feel like burning heat.
1301549	1303669	While she's doing that, I'm going to take a shot.
1303749	1304770	I'm going to do my next shot here.
1304810	1306310	This is some hot damn.
1306811	1307391	So, cheers.
1307431	1308771	I'm going to toast Loki's water here.
1309892	1310832	Oh, wait.
1311092	1312293	It looks like Walt Husson.
1317995	1320556	Right now, I'm currently pointing and laughing at Rob.
1320916	1321376	Oh, wow.
1326433	1327654	Oh, God.
1328536	1331721	It tastes like 20 Cinnamon Jolly Ranchers all at once.
1332622	1332842	Ew.
1334024	1335186	That other thing looks like butter.
1336348	1336989	Like butter.
1337229	1337630	Butter.
1338090	1339232	Crack, crack, butter.
1340824	1343627	I shouldn't be drinking so much until Brad and Irene get here.
1344027	1344267	Well.
1344608	1348431	You guys are going to have to carry this show once I pass out, so enjoy.
1348451	1352414	No, I should make a run to Walgreens and get you stuff.
1352615	1353996	You've been drinking, young lady.
1354036	1354676	You can't drive.
1354816	1355817	I'll go in an hour.
1356498	1357158	You'll go in an hour.
1357479	1360701	Make Brad and Irene go when they get here before they start drinking.
1360862	1365906	Yeah, I want another two liter of Pepsi and bag of pretzels so I can get sick again.
1366647	1368028	I'll make them get maraschino cherries.
1370000	1389874	and we'll soak him in the Nalibu you know what sucks is when I get really drunk I start making out with everybody but y'all are prudes so I don't know I think it's that we're both taken that too no I know but you should have seen this one New Year's party I went to I got to see Rob make out with a girl shut up
1396903	1397384	Let's see.
1397564	1400825	This is going to be funny because we're going to get lots of blackmail material on Rob.
1400966	1401726	No, you're not.
1401926	1403007	I'm going to delete this episode.
1403067	1404127	It's never going to air again.
1405868	1407149	It'll be the long lost episode.
1407369	1410150	It's going the way of the taped at Scandia episode.
1410591	1411031	It's alright.
1411051	1411611	We know that.
1411711	1412612	How hot is your face?
1414473	1414833	Let's see.
1415413	1416714	Jamie measures in at...
1418795	1420016	Oh, she's off the scale!
1420276	1420716	She's off 86.
1420816	1423177	86 is as high as it goes.
1423197	1423957	She's hotter than that.
1424617	1425858	I think we need to get her a thermometer.
1426298	1427379	That makes sense, but you know.
1428139	1428839	This one works better.
1429740	1429980	Okay.
1432141	1433461	She put it down her cleavage.
1433481	1434201	This one sucks.
1438283	1438643	Anyways.
1439123	1441184	We're getting Sakura Boopy action on this show.
1441204	1443965	I didn't show my boobs.
1444185	1444546	Hello.
1444986	1446266	You haven't drunken enough yet.
1446286	1447587	And I'm not gonna.
1450231	1454254	Okay, yeah, um, what else can we talk about that's Bimani-related?
1454394	1458296	Well, let's see, I gotta kinda cover the, carry the show here.
1458957	1462599	Just remember the Shaft live coverage you had to do all by yourself.
1462839	1464580	I know, that's awful.
1465241	1468903	Anyways, here's the big stuff that's coming up, uh, that happened.
1469283	1474707	Uh, they're starting now testing for Guitar Freaks 8, er, 9, and Drumania 8s.
1475586	1478289	Wow, it's the same goddamn game with new numbers.
1478630	1483596	But it's got the cool little thingy with the cards that no one's ever going to get.
1484637	1485298	A neat font.
1485378	1486299	Yeah, it's pretty looking.
1486319	1488361	And they changed the names to GF and DM.
1490604	1492306	No, no, no, it needs to be Guitadora.
1493607	1494709	Like fourth and third.
1496499	1497060	You know what, though?
1497900	1499842	At AI, they have the power-up versions.
1499862	1503725	They're supposed to have the neat little initial, do you want to be card things, and they don't have them at AI.
1504246	1504986	I made me sad.
1505267	1508129	Oh yeah, I know, and I've talked about this like three weeks in a row.
1510051	1510531	Brian's out.
1510571	1511832	He'll close the door, Jamie.
1513834	1515515	I know, I didn't get another card.
1516496	1519419	I know, I need another card to mate with my Derby Owner's cards.
1520325	1532316	Okay, my thing is full, and I can't, someone, one of our Bay Area listeners, buy me one of those card binders for my horses, and I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll think kindly of you.
1533637	1537621	Um, let's see, other stuff in the world, since I gotta kind of stretch this out, whatever it is.
1537661	1540623	Okay, wait, I want to know something about Guitar Freaks Night and Dromania.
1540723	1542345	There's a song in there called I'm a Loser.
1542465	1543426	Is that the Beatles song?
1545788	1550954	I'm a loser I'm a loser What's that?
1554338	1555479	Oh yeah, how was the concert?
1555499	1557161	Jamie, tell us about the concert you went to last night
1558351	1559552	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1580533	1582735	And that was a really good show.
1582815	1584396	He was, of course, really sexy.
1584416	1585777	And everybody decided to go up front.
1586097	1588399	And I'm like, fuck going up front, because you know what?
1588599	1590660	I ate ten penguins.
1591281	1594843	So I was going through caffeine shock at the time and decided to sit there where I was.
1595484	1596144	I got up this morning.
1596164	1598286	I was going to go to the convention to see him, but that started at 4.10.
1599687	1601208	And I had to be here at 5, okay?
1601868	1604390	So I wasn't going to have time to enjoy myself in the dealer's room.
1604430	1605511	I didn't want to deal with that.
1606091	1611915	So, um, I skipped out on that, sold my ticket to my friend Krista, went out for breakfast.
1612615	1614196	How much were tickets to the sci-fi convention?
1614216	1615137	Twenty-five a day.
1615157	1615257	Dang.
1615277	1620780	And I don't want to give... But it was supposed to have Captain Janeway of the Starship Voyager.
1620961	1622782	I'm Captain Janeway.
1623902	1624723	Warp drive.
1626064	1626224	No.
1627024	1630447	But, you know, it was just, it was just, uh-uh.
1631687	1632628	I decided against it.
1632928	1634049	So I bought Dojinshi instead.
1635785	1640987	Captain Janeway should have been, like, ejected into space when the show started.
1641907	1645049	No, you can't eject Captain Janeway into space.
1645069	1647110	She was a cool captain, but she did not have the Picard factor.
1647130	1648910	What are you talking about?
1648930	1651991	She's, like, she could have been bald and manlier.
1653892	1656233	And she just needed to be bald and she would have had it down.
1657214	1659194	It was Picard in a fucking wig.
1659414	1660155	That's what it was.
1660595	1660955	No.
1662175	1662716	She was cool.
1663576	1666297	I can't believe we're actually talking Star Trek on this show.
1666357	1672498	I mean, if we weren't like the biggest dorks on the planet already, I think that just brought our show to an all-time new low.
1672518	1675358	Now, Picard and Janeway had a baby.
1676019	1677239	What would that look like?
1678999	1682060	It'd be Jane Card, or something like that.
1683240	1683700	Pickway.
1685501	1686781	Isn't that a store, Pickin' Way?
1687321	1687641	I don't know.
1690888	1691869	Okay, I'm going to do another shot.
1691889	1692409	How's that sound?
1694591	1695091	That's too late.
1695111	1697733	I already poured me a shot of hot damn.
1697953	1698894	I'm not going to mix.
1698974	1702697	That's going to be nasty, like hot butter, hot buttery nipple sex.
1703658	1704278	Hold on.
1704498	1706059	Okay, here's another shot of hot damn.
1706079	1706600	Make it slurpy.
1707540	1708141	Make it slurpy?
1708241	1708821	Make it slurpy.
1712264	1713185	That's good radio.
1718328	1718849	You okay?
1719489	1720270	Oh, God.
1723304	1724806	I want to smell the better stuff.
1725586	1728749	Oh, that shit is nasty, fuck.
1730871	1731731	You slurped it.
1734654	1736155	My mouth's on fire.
1737256	1738417	His mouth's on fire.
1743801	1747845	So, I'm trying to push the show along.
1750319	1751259	It does smell like Werther's.
1753320	1754001	It smells like Werther's.
1756042	1757322	It's, it, oh.
1761664	1765426	No, the butterscotch stuff tastes like candy.
1765466	1767067	It tastes like liquid candy things.
1768427	1770548	Check the proof on Hot Damn.
1770588	1770928	I think it's 100.
1772329	1773049	It says Hot Damn 100.
1773109	1773890	Yeah, it's 100 proof.
1777293	1782157	No, and I... I cannot hold liquor for shit.
1782257	1783618	Oh my god, it does taste like candy.
1784038	1785419	You're not supposed to be drinking anymore.
1786660	1787241	Alright, fine.
1790943	1792765	Jamie's got to call a taxi.
1792825	1793645	I want some of this stuff.
1793665	1794766	This stuff tastes yummy.
1794806	1795427	It's like candy.
1795947	1797748	I can't believe you've never had butterscotch snaps.
1799870	1800811	Anyways...
1803405	1805489	So, other stuff in the Pomani world.
1807412	1808694	There's some tournaments coming up.
1809115	1809977	I want to talk about tournaments.
1809997	1811800	Oh, good, because I don't know Jack about these things.
1811820	1813944	We need to be playing Theme of Flojack, Mr. Junk Remix.
1815764	1816545	Do we even have that?
1816605	1817626	Was it on one of your pre-shows?
1818246	1818707	I think I do.
1819047	1827714	Okay, I want to talk about upcoming tournaments, because at least in the Bay Area, and I apologize because I know this is a national show, but I don't know much about what's going on on the East Coast.
1827734	1836261	But if you want to send me private messages, if you want to plug a tournament, send me a private message, I'll plug it for you in the chat room.
1836622	1841065	If you aren't in the chat room, just visit our webpage, orangelounge.skie.cx.
1841486	1842466	It's just that simple.
1843027	1844048	Anyway, upcoming tournaments.
1844728	1848392	January 31st is Miggle Extreme at Milpitas Golf Land.
1848412	1850373	It's going to be Perfect Attack and Improv Freestyle.
1850473	1853456	And I actually am going to have a half day off work, so I'm going to go.
1853656	1854117	It'll be fun.
1855538	1858521	Now, are you going to enter PA just for the hell of it?
1858921	1860863	I don't think so, because this is the problem.
1861403	1867848	See, now since I placed fourth at the last one, and I guess, you know, as they're saying, I upset people and da-da-da, you know, all that stuff.
1868228	1869589	There's too much pressure.
1869789	1873011	Like, now I'm expected to enter again, and I don't want that pressure.
1873031	1874492	I'm going to quit while I'm ahead, I think.
1874512	1875593	I'm going to be a lazy bum.
1876013	1876774	I'm going to retire.
1877174	1877634	I'm going to do that.
1877654	1880836	I'm going to retire from DDR, and like in a month, I'll come back.
1880876	1882978	I'll say, oh, I fell in love with the game again.
1883358	1884319	Because everybody does that.
1885580	1886220	Cut the bullshit.
1887901	1888782	Just fuck their world up.
1890399	1894082	It's about time somebody else got in the top category.
1895563	1897844	The first place should not go to an Asian.
1900406	1900946	Why not?
1901046	1902027	Are you a racist, sir?
1902367	1902767	No.
1903007	1903348	Yes.
1903728	1904388	No, I'm just kidding.
1905109	1907591	I want to get really good at Perfect Attack so I can win.
1908871	1909652	You do that, girl.
1909892	1913354	I'm going to memorize all the songs on Stealth and make them play them on Stealth and then I'll win.
1914815	1915556	Okay, no, I'm not going to do that.
1916181	1918102	Okay, shit, what else?
1918323	1919063	What other tournaments?
1919103	1920424	Oh, CyberZone.
1920984	1921545	CyberZone.
1921565	1928309	And these guys, these guys have some big balls over there because they have this whole commercial that they're doing now.
1928349	1930671	They have this whole, like, yeah, they put it on the web.
1930751	1931612	I wish I'd saved it.
1931632	1933113	I deleted the damn thing after watching it once.
1933133	1934434	They put a commercial up online.
1935174	1936656	Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.
1955898	1960040	I don't know what you'd call it, the ego to be doing something like that, a commercial.
1960340	1963683	But that's going to be like a two, three day tournament, and that's in LA in a couple weeks.
1963723	1964683	And Jamie's mad at them.
1964843	1965704	Why are you mad at them, Jamie?
1965724	1966825	That's going to be part of my fuck you of the week.
1967205	1968426	Oh, it's going to be part of your fuck you of the week?
1968566	1968766	Okay.
1969106	1969907	We'll get to that later then.
1970167	1973209	But I'm going to be trying to go to CyberZone, so...
1973809	1974089	Yeah.
1975250	1983256	Let's check my private messages, because I think we're going to be having some... Some messages about... He's already uncoordinated.
1983296	1983857	This is funny.
1984998	1987219	Oh my god, I got... Look, it's sticky.
1987880	1988901	My desk is sticky.
1988961	1989521	That's awful.
1989581	1990922	Okay, that's personal issues, man.
1991102	1991563	No!
1991683	1993784	Not that, you perverts!
1994425	1994785	Gross.
1995325	1995786	Gross!
1998468	2001290	Bob, I'll tell you what, we'll just get you some wet naps by your monitor.
2003072	2006373	Muheimer says the East has no tournaments and no machines and they suck.
2006533	2008653	Just go to look on DDR Freak on the tournament section.
2009074	2011314	Can we talk about the possibility of Shaft 2?
2011754	2012754	No, because it's a long ways away.
2013255	2014315	That's like next November.
2014395	2014795	Hello?
2015315	2016835	Ah, back to basics.
2016976	2018876	February 8th at American Comics.
2019396	2020536	It's a fourth plus tourney.
2020656	2021377	Oh, old school.
2021877	2022257	Right on.
2024017	2025198	Someone take the nuts away from me.
2025918	2026498	Let's see.
2027038	2027498	Hold my nuts.
2027598	2027858	Okay.
2029759	2030599	My nuts are bouncy.
2032597	2033118	and Greasy.
2034880	2035861	I'm just eating my nuts now.
2036161	2036722	I like your nuts.
2039825	2041507	DEAD AIR!
2041547	2041747	Sorry.
2041767	2042928	What do you want me to talk about?
2044470	2045872	Oh, it's in Hayward.
2046152	2048294	We need someone new to dedicate our dead air to, by the way.
2050337	2051558	Should we dedicate our dead airspace to?
2053726	2054066	I don't know.
2054767	2057448	Let's dedicate it to Chubbs, because he was supposed to be here tonight, but he flaked.
2057708	2057968	Okay.
2058908	2060829	Tonight's Dead Airspace is dedicated to Chubbs.
2061069	2061329	Alright.
2062950	2063470	He's Poe.
2064731	2066612	Alright, we're going to take a break and gather ourselves.
2066772	2067092	And pee.
2067732	2070013	But before we get a break, I think I want to do another shot.
2071054	2071554	Goddamn.
2073098	2075299	Oh, he's doing a shot of candy now.
2077561	2079702	My voice is fucked up from last night.
2080443	2081644	From all that coughing I've been doing.
2082864	2084105	I sound like a 12-year-old boy.
2088088	2088628	Cheers!
2089268	2090069	Cheers!
2090509	2091230	Cheers!
2091390	2094012	One for me, and one for my homies.
2095492	2096173	I just spit.
2096533	2097154	Cheers!
2097794	2099175	What do you mean you ain't got no homies?
2100716	2102297	I've made Rob snort his liquor.
2104130	2113573	Alright, we're going to go into a break now, and we're going to start that break with... I don't know, what do we want to hear?
2115714	2117294	I'm trying to drive my computer drunk.
2117575	2120355	I've got CDs.
2120556	2121236	Where's your CD?
2121436	2121956	Is it in here?
2121976	2123016	No, it's right here.
2123036	2125237	It's right here.
2125277	2125617	Give me.
2125737	2126818	Don't get it sticky.
2126838	2127178	Give me.
2129339	2132560	I do not want to hear get sticky and rob in the same sentence.
2133200	2133580	Shut up.
2134136	2134696	No!
2135237	2139080	I'm supposed to be talking, because goddamn it, I'm a host.
2139180	2140280	They're just doing... You wanna?
2140641	2140801	No.
2140821	2146265	I'm gonna sit back and let my shot wear off.
2147966	2149947	We're gonna play something from Extreme.
2151768	2152869	And something else from Extreme.
2152889	2153309	This one here?
2153670	2154991	Okay, we're gonna play some stuff from Extreme.
2155011	2157112	That was a really disgusting burp.

2548912	2554816	Hi, Loki's jamming on my keyboard in the back there.
2556837	2558558	Oh my god, it's a paranoia mix.
2562060	2562741	That was Doki.
2567421	2569222	Wait, come on, do it, do it, play me a mix.
2571683	2574524	Is it even picking it up over, I don't even know if it's picking it up over the air.
2574924	2575404	Play it again.
2576665	2577005	Do it.
2578426	2579106	Bongo demands it.
2595231	2596172	I can't work with you.
2596192	2597232	You suck at the DDR.
2601895	2602656	Nowki, you ain't.
2603436	2605837	There's one that goes, ooh, baby, or something like that.
2605878	2606598	That's really funny.
2606738	2607398	Or it goes, uh-huh.
2608519	2609099	I don't remember.
2609139	2609860	You'll have to find it.
2613202	2617244	Yeah, there it is.
2618005	2618505	Excellent.
2620646	2621007	Okay.
2621287	2621827	Yeah.
2621907	2623308	That's my roommate's keyboard.
2623788	2624569	It's really cool.
2625623	2629206	Anyway, hi, welcome to Orange Slides.
2629366	2630226	Just tuning in.
2630987	2634429	Tonight's the show where I've been doing a little bit of drinking.
2634869	2635990	You sound like you're about to cry.
2636010	2638392	No, I'm not!
2644346	2649048	And Jamie's had a shot, but she's got to be driving home in three hours, so she can only have her one shot.
2649068	2651949	She's got to pee it out before she can drive home.
2652569	2655210	And Loki's the responsible one of the bunch.
2655290	2656230	He's not drinking at all.
2656611	2657231	What a good boy.
2658511	2659172	I just don't drink.
2659492	2659712	Ever.
2661232	2662113	Is there any particular reason?
2662153	2663853	Is that for religious reasons or what?
2665134	2667855	Because if I think if I get drunk, I'll probably become violent and kill people.
2668410	2669471	Cool, let's get a drink.
2669491	2670251	Cool, let's get you drunk.
2670271	2672753	I've decided to have work tomorrow.
2673354	2674235	No.
2674715	2675235	I could drink.
2675816	2678878	Hooray for Martin Luther King Jr., because I don't have to work tomorrow.
2679559	2681100	Start the song.
2682921	2683342	Alright.
2683522	2684322	Start the song.
2684342	2687765	We're going to get into the... Oh, shit, I almost knocked your shot glass over.
2687825	2687965	My bad.
2688025	2688486	It's empty.
2688606	2689226	My bad.
2689246	2689867	Here, have the rest.
2695851	2696512	I had a drop.
2699262	2704524	You dropped the bomb on my tongue.
2704944	2706185	God damn it, play my song.
2706665	2707805	I'm sorry, we're not into that.
2707825	2711306	Ew, you're disgusting.
2711326	2712027	Where's my propel?
2712527	2713067	God.
2713447	2715388	Okay, we're going to get into the FUs of the week.
2716288	2719289	And Jamie, tell the chatroom about the FUs of the week.
2719309	2722610	You can start sending those to me over private message, by the way, in the chatroom.
2723150	2723811	FUs of the week.
2723911	2724911	Sorry, I didn't give you more warning.
2725552	2727934	Debuts of the week are basically... God damn it, we're pissed.
2728534	2729495	This stuff sucks.
2729835	2730776	We're gonna bitch about it.
2731036	2731957	And you can bitch with us.
2732617	2733538	We'll bitch on your behalf.
2733758	2734119	Cool.
2734559	2736120	And we get neat theme music and you don't.
2737401	2739783	Um... I gotta find your music.
2741544	2742005	There it is.
2743245	2743566	You ready?
2743786	2744206	Yes.
2751892	2752773	This is fucked up.
2752953	2753133	Okay.
2754094	2754334	Okay.
2755547	2759629	Um, first fuck you of the week goes to Rob for having tomorrow off.
2759729	2761009	Fuck you, bitch!
2761730	2762870	Bitch, don't make me cut you.
2763050	2763410	I will.
2763490	2765551	Come over there and beat your ass, woman.
2765891	2767912	I'd be kicking your ass so hard you'd be tasting rubber.
2767992	2769833	I'm gonna kick your ass right back to the kitchen.
2771854	2772114	Okay.
2772714	2773795	What the fuck ever.
2774075	2774795	Anyway.
2775896	2779077	Yes, my work doesn't believe in racial equality.
2780899	2785761	So, they do not celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.
2785681	2786221	's birthday.
2786661	2787061	I don't know.
2787082	2789763	I think they just want us all to work a lot.
2790703	2794945	Also, fuck the faceplate on my CD player.
2795605	2797466	I was just going to be responsible and take my faceplate off.
2798726	2800747	I put the thing back on and now the buttons aren't lined up.
2801307	2807011	And like, it'll like, whenever I go over a bump or something, the faceplate will get, you know, mal-aligned or something.
2807571	2811413	And then I have to like, hit my CD player to get the faceplate back on and then unpause it.
2811433	2814575	Because it'll like, hit the pause button and then turn down the volume all the way.
2815216	2816697	Because it's a faceplate.
2816737	2817957	Like, what's that, Ran?
2817977	2818358	What is it?
2818378	2820919	What do you have, Rob?
2820959	2821480	Jensen.
2822700	2826123	What is it?
2826263	2827443	I need a two-piece CD player.
2827503	2828324	I can actually hold it.
2830506	2831146	Sorry everyone.
2831606	2832947	I've got this shit still in here anyway.
2833707	2834508	You've verped on it.
2836368	2840290	Um, fuck Losing My Voice, which I did.
2840870	2842270	Fuck Denny's, okay?
2842671	2846152	Fuck Denny's, TGI Fridays, and Lions.
2847212	2853154	Last night after the show, and it was by the way, the Lions that, um, my drinking buddy.
2853335	2853755	Really?
2853795	2856236	It was closed.
2856756	2857056	Fuck it.
2857882	2860284	Oh yeah, they're not open anymore.
2860604	2861265	I miss him, though.
2861285	2864748	We went to the Denny's, the one that's on Hell, okay?
2865308	2869252	They had a sign on their door that said, we're closed due to maintenance.
2869272	2870393	And there were fucking people in there.
2871474	2871894	The fucks?
2873255	2877038	We go to teach our Fridays because they have that late night weekend deal.
2877559	2878340	They were closed.
2879340	2879741	Bitches.
2881022	2882103	Rob's about to bring more candy.
2884063	2893830	Um, fuck not having my animal across the town for two weeks, but Dan's gonna go retrieve it for me, but thank, very nice thank you to Amy for keeping our village happy.
2895051	2897272	Um, although I'll probably have cockroaches living under my bonfire.
2898253	2900755	Yes, cause my house is a shrine to fire.
2900995	2912223	Um, fuck, um, not wanting to go to the convention today and missing me to see my man, but hey, I got 20 bucks back, so it's cool.
2913460	2920382	Um, Waffle Square was really nice, but fuck them for putting butter on my English muffins, and I had to get them taken back.
2922343	2923823	And, um, fuck my shoes.
2925064	2925344	Again.
2926224	2933286	My new Vans are really awesome and comfy, but they, like, slip loose on my heel, and then the tongue is one of those super thick, cushy ones.
2934147	2937908	And now, um, um, I think...
2941169	2941949	Yes, I needed that.
2942049	2942390	Okay.
2942870	2946651	Um, so I have to go get cross-trainer shoes or I'll be able to get some escape rations just to wear to the gym.
2947052	2951453	Yeah, I was on the exercise bike and my feet went numb because of my shoes.
2952954	2953974	Um, let's see.
2955215	2957636	Another fuck you goes to, um...
2959568	2964511	Me, for only being able to last 12 minutes on the elliptical trainer, but I'm building up to it.
2965492	2971115	It also, uh, another question goes to me for stepping from the hot senior gym to go into the freezing cold outside.
2971475	2973757	Get the microphone out of the crotch, okay?
2974277	2974857	Sorry.
2975458	2976639	Rob's pumping the microphone now.
2977679	2981001	Um, and, but... Jamie's getting a call!
2981802	2983163	Jamie, take a call live on air.
2985064	2985944	Hold on, I'll pause the music.
2985964	2986204	Okay.
2988303	2990485	I'm talking to you and I've got the microphone right now.
2990565	2991045	We're live.
2993987	2994787	You're heading over right now?
2996268	2996568	Okay.
2997429	2999850	I've been holding the speaker up to the thing.
3000230	3001531	Say something to the listeners.
3005753	3006474	They can't hear that.
3007194	3007915	They can't hear you.
3008735	3013438	Unfortunately, because I don't have the phone that has like 20 million decibels or something.
3013838	3015499	So, head on over.
3016400	3017421	We're doing fuck yous right now.
3018542	3020103	We're doing the fuck yous of the week right now.
3021164	3022265	Great radio right here.
3022285	3023406	We'll save one for you, okay?
3024547	3025748	Alright, come on over.
3025828	3026649	We're all getting drunk.
3026869	3027509	Oh, well, Rob is.
3028851	3029992	Alright, see you in a few.
3030812	3031132	No, no.
3031693	3035096	Jonas went for like 45 minutes last week with his fuck you.
3035136	3036597	He gets two.
3036637	3037278	He's quoted.
3037318	3039600	He gets two fuck yous, that's it.
3039840	3040681	Yeah.
3040721	3041541	I was still doing my thing.
3041561	3042442	Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
3042482	3043643	I paused that for your phone call.
3043663	3043983	Go ahead.
3044123	3044584	Okay, well...
3046429	3050753	I would have to say fuck you to my boys, except I think that right now my boys look really fucking cool.
3051914	3056337	Except I can't, like, sing in the car with my new CD player.
3057438	3061582	And it sucks because I like holding, I hate people being off key.
3062402	3065505	And I try my hardest to stay on key and I just can't keep my voice down.
3066285	3067767	And it hurts my musician's pride.
3068287	3069168	It makes me have a fit.
3071241	3078004	and fuck you to that person who I got a picture of the car like mine from for not allowing remote leaking.
3078644	3079024	Fuck you.
3079725	3082946	Yeah.
3084147	3085207	Um, yeah.
3085227	3085507	Sorry.
3086308	3087508	I think I'm going to pass the microphone.
3087988	3088889	Okay, Loki's turn.
3091184	3093666	I don't want to think that I always have a lot of things to sing about.
3093726	3095807	Actually, I'm kind of tired right now.
3095867	3099170	I'm not very angsty, but I have a couple things.
3099630	3101271	First one goes to Lustketchup.
3102011	3105274	You unoriginal bitches need to get your own song and own dance steps.
3105314	3106755	Stop ripping off of other people.
3107115	3107875	I know that dance.
3108016	3108836	It's a hand jive.
3108916	3111618	It was back in the 60s or 50s, whenever the fuck it was.
3111838	3114080	It was in the... Whatever is in the fucking...
3115441	3118903	Yeah, but the dance, the whole movie took place back in the 50s or 60s, so there.
3119584	3122445	Anyways, so, the whole dance is the stupid hand jive.
3122585	3125447	And your stupid song, you know, Rapper's Delight, yeah, we know it.
3125507	3127628	So you butchered it with stupid, you know, Spanish lyrics.
3127648	3132511	You know, you can go fuck yourselves and go prostitute yourselves like every other failing artist out there.
3132571	3133612	So, uh, bye.
3134452	3138215	Um, the second nephew goes to the freaking DDR Extreme Machine for freezing up.
3139035	3142818	Konami, seriously, you need to make something that works right the first time.
3142918	3144779	Something that's not messed up in any sort of way.
3145720	3149565	Um, I don't know, have you ever heard of, I don't know, testing your fucking shit?
3149945	3155052	You tested it for like a couple weeks now, why didn't you catch this shit when it, you know, originally had it?
3155072	3156594	What the fuck is this?!
3158777	3160019	Take this shit off, now!
3166583	3173747	Anyway, um, no he doesn't get a fuck you, that was just, that was comedic timing because I wasn't paying attention to it.
3173887	3175808	Loki doesn't want to fuck me, he doesn't swing that way.
3175828	3176829	I don't swing that way.
3177929	3180511	Hello, what's up my homies?
3182532	3183692	Hey people.
3185017	3186458	We got more people to join in drinking.
3186478	3187399	Okay, finish up, Loki.
3187419	3188841	We'll introduce the guests soon.
3188861	3195147	So, F you to stupid drivers because I hate you and you just won't die like I want you to.
3195787	3200071	I mean, I figure if you're dumb enough to freaking drive the way you do, I'm surprised you haven't gotten accidents yet.
3201112	3204816	F you to the stupid script on my website for not working all this week.
3205096	3207778	But at least we've got that finally working, so that's not a big deal anymore.
3208819	3210061	Um, let's see here.
3210621	3216207	Effie is a stupid kid to look at me trying to figure out what I'm doing on the DDR pad.
3216807	3220551	If you're too dumb to realize what the hell a game is, then you shouldn't be in an arcade.
3221432	3221752	Go away.
3221973	3222873	I'm just really nice.
3223995	3225356	There's lots of Akuma Hall there.
3226817	3228139	Okay, keep going, keep going.
3228199	3229921	I can't, there's too many distractions!
3233078	3234179	Oh, there's peer pressure!
3234779	3237460	No, freaking, um... I don't know.
3238121	3239061	I don't really have much.
3239541	3240242	I think I'm done.
3240562	3240862	For now.
3240942	3243083	I'm sure I'll think of more later to complain about.
3244044	3245384	But, I'm done for now.
3245705	3246025	Alright.
3246885	3247506	Loki's done.
3247706	3248346	I'm done for now.
3248426	3249827	You spent... For now.
3250427	3251448	The keyword is for now.
3252528	3253048	My turn.
3253489	3256950	My first fuck you goes to Butterscotch Schnapps for fucking me up.
3262183	3262923	Oh, that's great.
3264804	3267746	My second FU goes to Brad, because Brad's got cool hair tonight.
3268026	3268806	That's awesome.
3270207	3272068	I just want to bend over, Brad.
3272308	3272768	You're mine.
3272868	3273689	Just kidding.
3276707	3280249	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3306119	3307381	Yeah, Irene looks pretty hot too.
3307441	3309023	Irene's like wearing a giant fishnet.
3311086	3311686	It's cute.
3312548	3315391	I'm gonna... Oh, you're gonna suck me?
3315531	3315772	What?
3319127	3321328	Hi, welcome to the drunk episode of Orange Ones.
3321928	3326129	My other FUs go to people that don't call you back.
3326550	3328410	I've already done that one before, I think.
3328810	3336093	I hate dating people that just want to fuck you on the first date and then you don't put out so they don't call you.
3336153	3336913	I hate that shit.
3337433	3340814	And, um... Fuck them in their nose.
3341315	3341775	And, um...
3343420	3354091	F you to, uh, um, Drama, Stop Causing Drama, I Hate You, um, I don't know what else, that's it.
3354291	3355112	Rob, drink some more.
3355392	3359696	Drink some more, I will in a minute, I don't have any, I'm not that, I'm all F you'd out today.
3359936	3361298	Let's read the chatroom's F you's.
3362987	3367897	Okay, I'm going to read the FUs for the chat room real fast.
3368698	3372205	Hold on real fast, let me find some appropriate music.
3373267	3373748	Okay, here we go.
3376385	3378266	Okay, wait, wait, I have to say something about Animal Crossing.
3379147	3380268	Loki's town is in.
3380388	3383169	If you go visit Loki's town again, though, another villager's going to move.
3383209	3384110	We already had one move.
3384330	3385331	Oh, you have a game cube now?
3385871	3386712	Take out his card.
3387432	3389474	It's in slot B. Ricky moved, though.
3389514	3390714	Ricky's an asshole, so it's fine.
3391775	3393336	It's in slot A, and it says Batston on it.
3393456	3396458	I don't know if... Yes, just remove the card in slot B. Okay, anyway, hi.
3396858	3397199	Sorry, yes.
3397219	3397419	All right.
3399740	3401441	Okay, Rob, try this drink.
3401461	3402482	Hold on, no, hold on.
3402522	3403923	What, what, eww, what is it?
3404163	3405444	It looks disgusting.
3406064	3407465	What's in it?
3407945	3408566	Spiced melon.
3408606	3409947	It looks like puke.
3410027	3410607	Spicy melon.
3413008	3413889	Chug, chug, chug.
3414870	3418932	Woo!
3420313	3421974	Describe the burning flavor.
3423135	3423195	Ow!
3427248	3429409	Oh my god, that shit is nasty.
3429469	3431930	What, bitch, what'd you do to that?
3432390	3433490	Goldslide Grimidory.
3434331	3435691	Oh my god!
3437532	3438612	They don't go hand in hand.
3439292	3440873	It tastes like cum.
3442614	3443014	Really?
3443834	3445615	You're being rather nice to call it that.
3447135	3448536	It tastes like fruity cum.
3450345	3452406	I'm going to get another random shot for Rob.
3452646	3453446	So I've heard.
3453886	3457428	Oh, is that like, you know, remember back on, um, when I was a guest on Understation Live?
3457448	3457508	Yes.
3457528	3458608	We were talking about those pills?
3458788	3459029	Yes.
3459249	3461770	That you take that flavors your... Yes, it's like that.
3462090	3462390	Yes.
3463050	3464051	It tastes like cunt.
3465991	3469833	Um, I'm trying to find the song I wanted to play for, um, the chat rooms, FUs.
3469853	3470753	Hold on, I'm looking.
3472274	3474435	Fill some space, you guys, while I look for the...
3477034	3478555	Oh, God, I feel like I got a verb.
3480496	3480996	What's that?
3481956	3491561	Vanilla rum.
3491581	3493482	Um, I'm trying to find, hold on, I've got it.
3493602	3496643	Okay, here's the song I wanted to use for Chatroom Refuse, because I hate this song.
3498384	3501446	Okay, the chatroom, starting with... Muheimer.
3501546	3502126	Muheimer.
3503615	3511362	Fuck the friggin' virus going around my damn school that was caught by my now-infected body and it forced me to miss a day of exams which had to be made up Tuesday.
3511442	3511743	Roar.
3512303	3516347	I still say fuck those damn pink and purple candy Valentine's Day hearts for ruining my bag.
3516928	3519750	And fuck the Orange Lounge site for still not having the cast section done.
3519770	3521212	I want to be the good stalker, which I am.
3521772	3523274	Fuck... Hold on a minute.
3523594	3524755	Fuck your medicine, rather.
3524815	3525756	Fuck cough medicine.
3525876	3527017	And fuck the Eagles hype.
3528498	3532399	Yeah, fuck being sick, because I've been sick all week.
3532559	3533000	I hate it.
3533340	3534380	Fuck.
3534460	3534880	Fuck.
3535580	3537061	Okay.
3537881	3541242	We're getting FUs for DDR Angel relayed through 23rd Magus.
3541602	3544503	Massive FU to the coworkers who call in sick in the last minute.
3544523	3546864	That's why she's not here tonight, and she's at work.
3547724	3563208	23 Magus has an FU to Angel's co-workers who call in sick at the last minute, an FU to Windows Media Player 9 for not supporting MP4s, and QuickTime for being the only player that'll support MP4s, the economy-sized FU to not having a car, and massive fucking FU to six teachers who give out term papers at the last minute.
3563248	3563908	Die, bitches.
3564268	3567009	I want all your balls to die, and I will supply the Stabity Death.
3568009	3568949	Calm me down.
3569169	3571410	I also want to send an FU to Hydra, because I can't.
3573946	3579488	Um, our Drama Queen twin says, I'm going to get a private message for that.
3580108	3582989	A few to Martin Luther King Day on my birthday once again.
3583489	3584410	Shout out to Loki.
3584730	3586771	Play that Secret Survivor song I sent you.
3590814	3591314	It's a secret.
3591334	3592015	It's a secret.
3592315	3593635	It's a secret rendezvous.
3593655	3595956	I'm saving it for, yeah, the section.
3596136	3597457	It's a secret rendezvous.
3597597	3599358	Are you having a secret rendezvous with Twin?
3599638	3601559	No, I'm not having a secret rendezvous.
3601939	3610883	I was contacting DJ Ranma because he's the guy that's sort of doing the webmastering stuff for my site, and he only has access to DJ Ranma, and he was fixing my script.
3611243	3616765	And so every time I'm on AOL, or AIM actually, Twin would come up and chat with me a little bit.
3618786	3621487	I'm going to get a twin before you send me that PM.
3621607	3622047	I'm drunk.
3622107	3623228	It's liquor talking, all right?
3623368	3624788	Yeah.
3625549	3630311	NoStylin says... All right, when's Brad going to start drinking?
3638834	3639274	How is it?
3642255	3643476	It tastes like peach urine.
3644016	3644816	Peach urine?
3645737	3646697	You know, I had that problem earlier.
3648927	3649708	I gotta pee.
3651788	3657670	Alright, Nostylan says, no more mixed drinks, give me a minute.
3657730	3659211	There goes all my liquor.
3659391	3660731	I need to calm down.
3660751	3663352	I need to put the car in park and stop for a minute.
3664612	3665693	Don't be feeding me more.
3665773	3667473	Okay, Nostylan, what's up?
3668153	3669154	Nostylan, bud.
3672255	3674595	Oh, shit, don't spill the drinks.
3674775	3676176	God, god damn.
3677438	3677958	Hot damn!
3678058	3678639	Oh shit!
3679139	3680260	Nostylin's window closed.
3680280	3680720	Where is it?
3681681	3684603	Nostylin.
3684623	3686284	Every time I think of Nostylin, I think of this song.
3686484	3687885	We need Ritalin.
3688005	3692448	I'm gonna get beat up for that.
3692548	3694149	This should be the last shot for a while.
3694469	3695530	I like to breathe!
3697511	3700513	Nostylin says the fuck me of the week is fuck dogs!
3700574	3701514	They chew on everything.
3701974	3702435	I agree.
3702495	3703115	Fuck dogs.
3704516	3706858	And fuck people who don't share files.
3710197	3712779	Fuck, what'd you do, you stupid bitch?
3712799	3715080	Hey, don't be so mean to me.
3715220	3715921	I love you, Jamie.
3715941	3716441	Give me a hug.
3716561	3716981	I love you.
3717141	3717982	You're my homie.
3718282	3720223	I'm gonna fall, but you're my homie.
3720283	3721004	Rob had to drink.
3721024	3721924	It's not even that much.
3723265	3723806	Give me that.
3723906	3724246	Okay.
3724266	3726007	Someone take your money.
3726127	3726587	Rob?
3726987	3727428	No.
3728468	3728809	No.
3729309	3729569	Okay.
3733652	3734072	Moving on.
3734152	3734732	Shane.
3735093	3736853	Shane's my buddy from LiveJournal.
3737233	3739654	He responded to a post and I didn't see it for like a month.
3740414	3744376	I think it's the same guy, I'm assuming, because they were both named Shane.
3744436	3745756	He says, finally I get to do FUs.
3745776	3746016	Yay.
3746056	3753059	Anyway, FU to my cousin for changing one of the animals say in my town on Animal Crossing to Yum Vagina.
3753719	3754299	Gross.
3755219	3759821	FU to the Wichita DDR players for finally playing nothing but damn stupid end of the century.
3760401	3760761	Trust me.
3770556	3773058	F you to Mecha Salt because I suck at it.
3773398	3774278	Xbox owner.
3774738	3777340	And F you to Taco Bell for getting rid of tostadas.
3778200	3781422	How about F you to Taco Bell for giving everybody diarrhea?
3784004	3784684	Let's do that.
3788286	3791948	Dark Tetsuya says no F yous, just a super secret thanks.
3792989	3796751	And F you to those who didn't see Under Station Live's relaunch last night.
3797391	3798212	I suck at sports.
3799509	3804873	www.understandationlive.org They own your soul.
3804913	3805834	Did I bite my lip?
3807055	3807735	I think I did.
3811839	3812959	What's wrong with my lip?
3813220	3815081	You're chewing it.
3816922	3817723	Yo, SFBB.
3818243	3819524	Yo, SFBB.
3823004	3830465	Fuck you to going somewhere and realizing you forgot your wallet, but it was worth it to go back and get it, though I was embarrassed Baja Fresh was way worth it.
3830905	3833166	Fuck you to all those Oolong haters from last week.
3833246	3835186	I agree, Oolong Bunny is the shit.
3835526	3836006	Fuck you.
3837347	3840707	Also, for the drunkenness episode, could you do a list list of schnapps flavors?
3840827	3842288	No, we have another list list on tap.
3843248	3846128	Un-fuck you to Xbox, because that new Panzer Dragoon game looks sweet.
3846248	3846728	Whatever.
3850856	3855199	Hydra, I want to send an FU to the 23rd Magus, because, well, I can.
3855900	3860183	I usually, I don't read personal FUs, but since 23rd Magus said FU to Hydra, I don't.
3860943	3861624	That's karma, bitch.
3862884	3865446	VidPower, I like VidPower, he's a cool guy.
3865706	3868688	And he puts up with those Thursday, uh, things never happening.
3868728	3871230	The Thursday rebroadcast never happened, and he puts up with it.
3871931	3874112	FU to 2DX Machines that don't play the videos.
3874713	3877054	And FU to 2DX Machines that freeze up on me twice.
3877314	3879416	FU to Fox for delaying 24 for another three weeks.
3879918	3881198	Word, my brother.
3881638	3885079	Fuck Fox, fuck 24 for going off for three weeks.
3885139	3885980	What the fuck is that?
3887540	3891701	And I'd like to say Fry's Electronics is great because they had a sale on video game consoles.
3891921	3892221	Okay.
3893022	3895562	And F you to Sky for not liking the song that's playing right now.
3895582	3896403	The song is ass.
3896503	3897043	It's Enya.
3897063	3897963	It makes me want to barf.
3898923	3902944	Chubbs, my bro, says, fuck myself for not being able to be there.
3903064	3903525	I agree.
3903565	3904085	You suck.
3904265	3904825	That's okay.
3906807	3910649	We wouldn't want to fuck Chubbs anyway because he doesn't swing that way, but, you know.
3912631	3915873	Oh yeah, F you to Jack in the Box for getting rid of the Westerner.
3916113	3919095	They got rid of the Western burger thing?
3920736	3921116	Fuck!
3921436	3923517	I want to touch your hair, Brad.
3923998	3925558	Please, please, Brad, let me touch it.
3925578	3927179	Brad, let me touch it.
3929341	3931682	Hold on, I'll be right back in a minute.
3932343	3934404	Fuck, fuck Jack in the Box for getting rid of that shit.
3936795	3938157	You are so fucked up.
3953021	3957022	Black Lab says, fuck you to crappy computers and that you don't have the webcam going right now.
3957062	3958403	Yeah, well, fuck you too, bitch.
3959763	3963104	And, uh, fuck Bag from Hydra, I agree.
3964085	3966225	And, uh, FU to Fries driving along the lines, whatever.
3966926	3967406	From Hydra.
3967686	3969086	Alright, let's get to the rest of it.
3969126	3970367	That's it for Chowroom FUs.
3970407	3970507	I'll...
3971414	3972015	I'll check the mail.
3972315	3974156	Hold on, I'm gonna go around the room.
3974277	3977039	Hold on, I gotta find a... Hold on, woman!
3977419	3977900	Woman!
3980022	3981203	No, no poop.
3981703	3982264	Shut up!
3982744	3983685	Oh my god!
3984045	3988109	You're wearing a corset, your boobies are popping out, they're getting everywhere.
3988849	3990311	Clean that shit up, woman.
3990811	3991412	Can I touch them?
3992673	3995615	Oh my god, I'm touching your boobie, it's funny!
3997270	3998430	He's like a little kid.
3999370	4000571	I'm like, boobie.
4001771	4005872	That was the sound of Tina's breast.
4006812	4010032	Okay, let's get to the FUs in the room.
4010433	4010873	Okay, yes.
4011373	4013013	Can I speak now?
4014233	4015274	I have another corset.
4015314	4018074	I've got the string.
4019674	4020815	I don't know, I just had it.
4022035	4022815	I might just wear that.
4023573	4025174	Woman, do your FUs.
4025214	4028375	My fuck you is fuck men because they all suck.
4028595	4029756	I agree, fuck men.
4030216	4032497	And I've got more to say on that one.
4032957	4036359	I haven't fucked men in like, never mind, we're not going to get into that on the show.
4037299	4038419	I'm not gay, I swear.
4038439	4039880	I'm going to say all my reasons.
4039920	4041141	It's just men suck as well.
4041181	4042081	Mom, I love the pussy.
4042381	4046023	And I hate, yeah, this is better.
4046603	4048804	We already have official show lesbians, I'm sorry.
4050802	4052984	You can be the official show pussy eater.
4053044	4053464	How's that?
4055366	4056426	You're a pussy vacuum.
4057147	4057948	No, I don't like that.
4057968	4059509	That doesn't sound as good.
4059609	4061230	Can I put my face in your boots?
4061250	4062111	Like you haven't before?
4073718	4076939	You guys, that scream was Rob screaming as I pinched his nipple.
4076979	4078319	I'm trying to do a radio show Rob.
4078339	4079520	Drink your pink stuff.
4102953	4104316	Did you finish your FU, Tina?
4107081	4107983	Fuck all men in general.
4110680	4112101	Rob is falling over.
4112801	4113801	Robby, you've had enough to drink.
4113881	4115622	He's such a lightweight, my god.
4115682	4116102	I know.
4116442	4118143	Rob is like, it's in his head.
4118223	4123885	He puts one thing of alcohol near his lips and suddenly he's just... He smells the bottle and he got buzzed.
4124085	4128346	I know, he's like, I can feel the music, I can taste the music.
4128386	4130087	He got giddy with the Malibu.
4130387	4132768	Oh, he likes the Malibu.
4132808	4133688	He loves the pop.
4133888	4134729	I mean, the Malibu.
4135909	4137030	It's Pink Rob Drink It.
4137610	4138811	It's Pink Rob.
4138831	4139912	Yes, I have spike hair.
4139992	4141593	Rob, Rob, Rob.
4141613	4143475	This drink, I've named it Pussy.
4144796	4145116	Here.
4146537	4149259	Turn off the background music on the, uh, thing.
4150980	4153121	Okay, I... Drink your pussy.
4153162	4155943	My energy goes to hangovers, because last night...
4157426	4159348	Damn.
4159689	4161290	Rob, you spilled it on you.
4161350	4162411	That's alcohol abuse.
4162952	4163653	Did you just pee?
4163693	4164874	Oh, wipe it up with something.
4164894	4165395	Don't lick it.
4165415	4166836	I am never sitting in that chair again.
4166876	4168898	Ew, he licked it and now he's fucking it.
4169819	4171841	He just wiped up alcohol with his ass.
4172342	4174244	My FU goes to hangovers.
4174464	4174905	I had...
4175555	4181221	A lot of Long Island iced tea and like three other drinks yesterday.
4181602	4187248	The Will special at Polyester's and I was sleeping until two today, so there you go.
4188849	4190371	Rob, are you coherent?
4191752	4192533	Are you gonna drink, Brad?
4193234	4194155	I'll have a shot or two.
4194355	4195016	I'll make you a shot.
4196110	4197531	No, I just want some Goldschlager.
4197831	4199111	I'll make you a normal one, I promise.
4199211	4200011	I'll make you a normal one.
4200171	4201172	Oh, I just want some Goldschlager.
4201872	4202492	I really gotta pee.
4202512	4204553	If I run to the bathroom, do you guys want to take the show over?
4204573	4205173	Chat room!
4205653	4207014	Wait, you guys want to take the show over?
4207174	4207494	Hold on.
4207774	4208974	Get back with a wet paper towel.
4209014	4210715	Get a wet paper towel so we can clean that shit up.
4211335	4211535	Rob.
4211675	4211955	Okay.
4212015	4213436	Okay, Rob is... Okay.
4214207	4215148	Rob's trying to make out with Brad.
4215168	4216109	Somebody rang the doorbell.
4216729	4218811	I think Jonas is here.
4219251	4219992	Hi, chat room.
4220672	4222594	Yeah, best show ever, my ass.
4222974	4223215	I know.
4223255	4224936	You know what?
4225056	4225677	It's my turn.
4226898	4229580	I think, well, did you have more fuck you's, Brad?
4229800	4230961	I think I've had my fuck you's.
4231441	4231902	You know what?
4232640	4235941	I think it's time right now that we go to a break.
4236422	4239823	Yeah, let's go to a break so I can clean this shit up that Rob's filled.
4240123	4245526	Yeah, I'm going to find files and I have no idea where any of Rob's stuff is.
4247026	4247987	It's going to take a moment.
4248467	4250308	I can hear Rob screaming out there.
4250608	4252348	Rob just said shit really loud, by the way.
4254349	4255009	Rob, don't run.
4255309	4256330	Rob, don't run.
4256510	4258411	I'm going to pee in somebody's bathroom.
4258511	4260251	Use Brooklyn's bathroom.
4260831	4262732	We're going to play some songs, yeah.
4263032	4266093	I'm just going to pick some random stuff.
4266754	4267654	Okay.
4267674	4269194	Okay, Matt, do your job.
4270075	4272276	I'm just picking stuff out of this random directory.
4273396	4274276	I'll pick really bad music.
4275417	4278098	Okay, we'll play some bad music in a minute.
4278398	4280679	But in the meantime, here's everyone's favorite vocalists.
4280899	4281139	Woo!
4282930	4283691	Let's run!
4283991	4294344	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,

4682982	4684143	and many more.
4708980	4712462	Hi, this is Melby of RTF.
4712482	4716624	For an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Melby can join us on all the fun together.
4725865	4731827	Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
4731847	4734048	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
4734628	4738670	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
4739831	4741411	Um, Rob's fucked up.
4741871	4748974	DarkSakura has taken over the command center because I don't want to drive drunk, ladies and gentlemen.
4749694	4753536	We need a designated, uh, radio personality.
4754506	4755606	I'm designated.
4757627	4760668	What are we going to talk about, you designated diva?
4760688	4765189	We need to do the list list, and I'll give you the chair back if you promise to type responsibly.
4765390	4768310	Okay, let's talk about something else.
4769171	4770511	Jonas is in the house!
4771711	4772412	Hi!
4772432	4773112	Hey!
4773192	4775973	You're not allowed to do FUs this week, though.
4776013	4778234	You did like three weeks worth last week.
4779234	4780694	Okay, you can do one FU.
4780774	4781295	You do one.
4782255	4782615	Okay.
4783376	4786097	This is the one big F you right here, only one.
4787338	4792361	To the asshole, you erased my damn GameCube, PS2, and Xbox memory cards.
4792381	4797023	I don't know, but some asshole erased my files in there.
4797043	4799665	60 games saved.
4799845	4800385	You fuck.
4801286	4802606	It's not you, it's a guy.
4803467	4804507	I like you, you're cool.
4805008	4807269	Well, whoever did this, fuck you.
4807629	4812792	Nothing says fuck you more than me giving you an ass kicking if I found out who the hell you are.
4822591	4822851	Hi.
4823632	4824753	Okay, Jonas, what's up?
4825193	4825773	That's your FU?
4826154	4827295	That's my only FU right now.
4827755	4828716	So how you doing, brother?
4828816	4829316	How you doing?
4829676	4830237	Alright.
4831057	4833039	You're not going to be able to drink with us tonight, that's a shame.
4833559	4833900	Oh well.
4834100	4836622	Oh well.
4836662	4838063	What do you think of Extreme?
4839384	4840044	Kicks ass.
4841405	4842646	The hell it kicks ass.
4842766	4844888	Wait, I got a question for future tournaments.
4845568	4850232	Would there be beginner mode allowed for freestyle?
4851507	4854010	I think there should be a tournament or a beginner mode.
4854350	4856011	Beginner shuffle for improv.
4856632	4860215	Like a weak improv tourney for white boys like myself.
4862878	4867082	Where I can, like, rape the bar and do, like, vanilla ice dancing.
4869284	4871806	Yeah.
4871826	4873688	We're done with the FUs, you can kill the music, it's cool.
4875890	4876611	I'm dizzy.
4876631	4878132	Oh, careful.
4878152	4882015	You don't want to get too drunk.
4882476	4884237	Oh, you're already drunk?
4884257	4885118	What the hell am I talking about?
4885158	4890963	I just got here, and I found that people are already drinking eight shots of glass and so forth.
4891684	4892324	I drink pussy.
4892925	4894386	Oh my god, I drank a pussy.
4895167	4895948	Dear lord.
4896618	4904480	I made the new nastiest shot ever, a combination of hot damn Goldschlager and Malibu, and I call it pussy, because it's pink like pussy.
4904661	4912203	We should warn any new listeners listening tonight that this is not the normal Orange Lounge, because I'm drunk as shit.
4913163	4914364	Yeah, guacamole del taco.
4914384	4921446	That's not what we usually do on this show, although we could, except I usually work Mondays, but not this Monday, because Martin Luther King Jr.,
4924608	4929111	is having a birthday tomorrow, even though he's dead, he's still having a birthday.
4929131	4930612	I'm repeating my fuck you, Rob.
4931012	4931292	What?
4931612	4931932	Bitch.
4932212	4932513	What?
4932653	4932953	Bitch.
4932993	4933513	Wait, what?
4933573	4934034	Fuck you.
4934354	4935174	What did I do to you?
4935715	4936975	What did I do to you?
4937355	4939076	You have tomorrow off, bitch.
4939537	4944119	So, I still gotta go to my, actually, no, you know what, that's not entirely true, because I'm going to my second job tomorrow.
4944580	4944900	Oh, yay.
4944920	4946601	So I probably won't go in until like 2 o'clock.
4946621	4948902	Okay, go play 2DX with me tomorrow.
4949462	4950363	I kinda wanna.
4950423	4951003	Okay.
4951023	4951183	Okay.
4951924	4953705	Anyway, we're doing a radio show, yeah.
4954503	4956424	I have to do laundry tomorrow, but I have to go to the gym, too.
4956724	4958705	What else is Bomani-related that we can talk about?
4958745	4959085	Loki!
4960486	4961807	I dropped the microphone!
4963327	4963668	What?
4964748	4964928	What?
4964988	4968890	Am I supposed to... Okay, I guess I gotta move to shore.
4970051	4973312	Okay, let's see, what haven't I talked about yet?
4973332	4977695	I don't know, I think we covered... Oh, of course.
4978095	4979375	New Dance Mania coming out!
4979495	4980776	We have Dance Mania EX2.
4981096	4982297	Okay.
4983979	4984380	Uh-oh!
4984741	4985343	Uh-oh!
4985985	4987289	Fuck you to all weight scales.
4987429	4988472	They all fucking lie.
4989435	4989676	Okay.
4991875	4999181	So yeah, Dance Mania EX2 is coming out, along with some other shit that I don't care about.
4999441	5002724	But EX2, it's kind of weird, is they've got a bunch of new covers on there.
5002944	5006166	They have Xtreme doing a cover of Long Train Run in this time around.
5006527	5010230	They have I Like to Move It being done by DJ Alligator Project.
5011030	5013152	So that's going to be pretty interesting.
5013612	5015073	Yeah, DJ Alligator Project.
5015814	5016955	So they have that happening.
5016975	5017355	Yeah.
5018698	5023200	They've got Sex on the Beach 2003 by Erotic.
5023220	5025440	It's going to be on there.
5026241	5028782	So it's the same song with just some trancy shit in the background.
5029462	5032683	I don't know, let's pull up the full list here.

5171175	5172195	Somebody get that for me, okay?
5172315	5174656	Because that's like right before my birthday.
5174756	5177017	Jamie, tell us about that disco special that was on ABC.
5177257	5180718	Okay, I was at the gym, and I was bored, so I got on the NetBike.
5181639	5183459	And, by the way, I didn't crash it this time.
5184760	5190502	I was on the NetPulse bike, and there was this disco special on ABC.
5190522	5193363	It was like Disco House Party or something, but it was hosted by Whoopi Goldberg.
5193963	5196444	And Paula, Rob, Paula Abdul was on it.
5197612	5203256	Um, but it was like, um, yeah, Paula Abdul was on that.
5203276	5204037	Paula Terry?
5204257	5204597	Never mind.
5204698	5205298	No, Paula Abdul.
5205318	5205838	Oh, it's Brad.
5206239	5206979	Oh, it's Brad.
5207360	5211563	Um, but no, um, it was a pretty neat special, but I was only on the bike for 30 minutes.
5211583	5212524	Stop it.
5213624	5216387	I was on the thing for 30, for 30 minutes because I was doing my warm-up.
5217127	5218828	Um, yeah, because I go to the gym now.
5219749	5220390	Chili's.
5220550	5220650	Um.
5221385	5222005	Yeah, anyway.
5223687	5227249	It was pretty cool because they played It's Rainin' Men.
5227889	5231672	And it was Whoopi Goldberg singing with this other, I think the lady who originally did it.
5232072	5232872	I don't remember who it was.
5233293	5234774	And then all these guys came down.
5234994	5235714	It was Gloria Gaynor.
5236755	5238436	Gloria Gaynor did I Will Survive.
5238456	5239797	Yeah, I know.
5240377	5243900	Dude, they had, what was her name?
5244160	5244700	Nikki French?
5245380	5245921	Was that her name?
5246321	5247602	Who did Total Eclipse of the Heart?
5249262	5249842	Yeah, sure.
5250263	5254765	Yeah, they had her come and sing Total Eclipse of the Heart, but it was all sped up and discally.
5255545	5259807	And then they had Usher doing... Oh, God, what's that song?
5260267	5269251	But it was really cool, because when he was out there singing it, he was wearing the little cap, and he was wearing Heelys and spinning around in it, and then they had all these people dancing on roller skates.
5269411	5271172	Please tell me Usher did Dancing Queen.
5271392	5275013	No, but a bunch of drag queens did Dancing Queen.
5275714	5277575	That was fabulous.
5277755	5278175	But no...
5280093	5281114	What was the song that Usher did?
5281194	5283376	It was Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now.
5283836	5284397	I think that was it.
5285337	5290482	But it was really cool, and normally I don't like hearing him sing, but he did that song justice, so it was cool.
5291403	5294746	And it was just kind of neat watching everybody dance the roller skates, because I had a Xanadu moment.
5296653	5298034	Wow, everyone's cleared out of the studio.
5298395	5298835	Hey!
5299155	5301417	There's a really weird stench in this area here.
5301477	5301898	It's Rob.
5302578	5303960	It's the stench of drunk Rob.
5304560	5304800	Yeah.
5304840	5306642	Either that or it's my shoes, sorry.
5306822	5307943	Gotta get used to that, man.
5308003	5310406	Forget the department.
5310606	5313028	Well, next week is not a drunk week.
5313568	5313949	Sorry.
5316485	5318907	Oh man, I don't want to go to work tomorrow.
5319227	5320248	Freaking A, they suck.
5320448	5328094	They don't give me anything to do at work, and I get all my work done, including all the busy work that I make for myself, and then they're like, oh sorry, you can't go and play on the internet.
5328254	5330095	Okay, well what the hell am I supposed to do, stare at the wall?
5330135	5332797	So that's what I've been doing for the last three days, is staring at the fucking wall.
5334018	5334738	So, yeah.
5338445	5341487	I have the best thing ever.
5343128	5347251	I can't say who it is, but one of our favorite people will take the cock.
5348451	5349172	But I'm going to say who.
5349772	5350593	Rob left the show?
5352974	5357817	Okay, it looks like it's just... You're our official... Get out of the chair!
5358217	5358978	It's my chair!
5360097	5365501	I quit to make room for Jahi because Jahi owns all and he's the new Lord of the Universe.
5365681	5366281	You're fired.
5367882	5369123	I have the chair.
5369283	5370965	I have some information about Jahi.
5371285	5371745	Yesterday,
5374163	5374824	Uh, yeah.
5376285	5377066	Rob remembers this.
5377687	5381891	I saw Jahi and his skivvies, but we're not supposed to talk about that.
5383312	5385414	We don't want to spread too many rumors here.
5385895	5386575	What's it say?
5386776	5387777	Don't say who, don't say who.
5387857	5388377	Woo!
5388537	5390820	Somebody wants to take the cock.
5390840	5392261	They will remain nameless.
5394103	5394924	Shut up!
5395324	5397286	Sorry, I don't do underage.
5399028	5399709	I didn't say it.
5399809	5401872	I know, Rob, that was rude.
5402112	5403233	Good thing we didn't get that on the mic.
5403314	5405176	Rob, you should go find some boobs.
5405617	5406778	Hey, Rob needs some boobs.
5407239	5408140	Rob's got boobs.
5408180	5410303	Dude, Brad, your shadow is fucking awesome.
5411124	5411925	I look like Chrono.
5411945	5413187	That's cool.
5415419	5415879	Touch your boobs.
5416959	5417459	I can't touch them.
5418780	5419620	I'm trying to quit.
5420880	5422200	Hey, no nipple touching.
5422240	5423660	Rob doesn't have the microphone.
5423680	5424601	We took it away from him.
5425101	5426081	He's over here molesting girls.
5426101	5426901	He doesn't puke on it.
5427741	5428401	Rob likes boobs.
5428981	5431662	Yo, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
5431922	5435262	This is the show of all shows.
5436003	5440723	Be... I have two microphones.
5440823	5442224	This is cool.
5443044	5443684	It's new.
5444508	5447531	I want to talk about Xtreme.
5447811	5448912	DDR Xtreme.
5449072	5451154	I played a non-stop today and I ranked.
5451354	5452975	That's awesome.
5452995	5466467	I thought I was old and broken down and smelly and I wasn't ever going to rank on a non-stop ever again, but I ranked.
5466787	5467168	What's up?
5467828	5468429	You are rank.
5469169	5469950	Shut up!
5478297	5483021	I can't, if anybody's new, tuning in tonight that's never listened before, trust us, this isn't the way it usually is.
5483041	5486444	Yes it is, what the fuck are you talking about?
5486464	5486824	Woman!
5487825	5487985	Woman!
5488025	5489466	Rob is an angry drunk.
5489907	5490647	Goddammit.
5490968	5492329	Rob is an angry drunk.
5492709	5494090	Rob, where's the song?
5494150	5494751	Where's the song?
5497876	5504863	Someone's, oh yeah, by the way, our word of the night, everyone, our word of the night is porn.
5505163	5506545	Porn!
5507105	5508427	You don't have it?
5509107	5511630	You get porn when you say the word.
5513552	5515374	Do I get a shot of something if I say the word?
5516377	5516697	Don't!
5517197	5518798	We're trying to get to our porny music.
5518838	5521018	Porn, porn, porn, porn.
5521118	5522739	And Tina just tit-fucked the mic.
5523239	5524759	Porn, porn, porn, porn.
5524779	5525939	P-p-p-p-porn.

5537542	5539363	Porn, porn, porn, porn, porn.
5539383	5541283	Rob, I thought you said you got gayer when you got drunk.
5544864	5547826	I know Tina a long time, and she'll let me touch her boobs whenever I want.
5547846	5549847	Because I know he doesn't get off, and so it's all fine.
5549867	5550908	Rob has a past issue with the boobs.
5551068	5551488	I know.
5551568	5552249	It's all for Brocky.
5552309	5553950	Oh my god, he's trying to touch my leg.
5554110	5554651	Like your buddy?
5554771	5555811	Yeah, exactly.
5555831	5556372	Let's head in the

5579166	5581926	I love that thing.
5582346	5584507	I love that thing.
5584547	5587807	You bet the Gold Club, too?
5588167	5590468	The Gold Club isn't that bad.
5591828	5594068	Best show ever.
5595128	5595609	Haha!
5595969	5597749	Best clip, Rob.
5598109	5600409	23Mega says, Rob is so drunk he's straight.
5602590	5603130	If only.
5611636	5611856	Awww!
5612476	5615579	Do it with me!
5617560	5617960	Okay.
5619361	5624745	Because the person says he's not nameless, Twin who is not nameless will take the cock.
5626286	5626887	And he wants porn.
5626927	5627707	I wanna play something!
5627927	5628608	Let me play something!
5629261	5629841	What do you want to play?
5629901	5630541	I'll play my song.

5631622	5634742	We are now passing the control of Winamp.

5644805	5647006	And then you click the button.
5647186	5648026	The one on the left.
5649161	5651603	Why are you playing shit on this show?
5652664	5655466	Because no one ever votes for my Cage Max song!
5655486	5656346	This is your punishment!
5656366	5657847	This is now our bad music section.
5657867	5658768	Thank you, we love you.

5767146	5771407	In the morning, laughing happy fish heads.
5771787	5775328	In the evening, floating in the soup.
5776334	5785997	Fish heads, fish heads, roly-poly fish heads, fish heads, fish heads, eat them up young.
5786057	5794040	Ask a fish head anything you want to, they won't answer, they can't talk.
5805648	5809350	That's enough for the fish heads, I'm sorry.
5809931	5812052	I love Dr. Demento, but I can't stand any more fish heads.

5935226	5935326	Jonas?
5935346	5936807	Raise your hand.
5936827	5938108	No, moan good, like sexy.

5952042	5955905	Rob just tried to grab... Hey!
5956445	5958466	Don't touch the Jamie.
5959967	5963590	Because there's somebody who's going to kick your ass if you do, and you know who that is.
5965251	5967232	Dan would so, like, kick your ass.
5967252	5968093	Dan Darian likes me.
5970356	5971417	No, no one does.
5971577	5972417	Dan Darion.
5972597	5974018	I'm kidding.
5974338	5978320	I know that there are certain people in town that don't like me, but Dan's not one of them.
5978360	5979061	Dan likes you.
5979441	5981542	Yeah, Dan Darion's my bro.
5981562	5981922	He's cool.

5986584	5987225	And some gum.
5987605	5987865	Gum.
5988465	5989606	Sorry, that was Zorak.
5993048	5997110	Even the people in town that don't like me I think are starting to be okay with me, so that's cool.
5997531	5999132	Everybody just wants your ass.
5999192	6000853	Eventually they realize they can't beat you.
6001073	6001553	That's right.
6002609	6004010	Everybody loves me.
6004490	6005811	You love me.
6005931	6006792	They come around.
6008072	6008533	You know what?
6008693	6009253	I had to.
6010394	6010594	Wait.
6011875	6013016	Did they do Shooting Star?
6013336	6015137	I'll give you a cage match.
6015157	6016057	Here's your cage match.
6016658	6019239	Okay, cage match time.
6019420	6019640	No.
6020220	6020880	Okay, you can do it.
6021021	6024723	Okay, Rob seems to be somewhat sober enough that he can take the chair again.
6025609	6027933	So Rob, I give you back your job.
6028294	6031920	Okay, dudes and dudesettes.
6033603	6034144	Shut up!
6034885	6036127	Joe, I don't suck.
6036427	6037690	You suck more.
6040915	6042155	I've been drinking a little bit.
6042496	6042896	Hold on.
6043356	6043896	Okay, hold on.
6043956	6045757	Hey everybody, they're gonna fight!
6045838	6046498	Yeah, that's right.
6046558	6048699	We're going into the cage match.
6049920	6051441	It's the drunken cage match.
6051541	6053682	I still haven't even picked my song for this week.
6054203	6059546	However, last week in the big, fat, bloated cage match...
6061385	6065586	We had, the winner was Aphex Twin doing a song called Eat Em Up.
6065907	6068067	No, it's not called Eat Em Up, it's called Power Pill.
6069028	6069368	Ha!
6069668	6072729	I was going to say, just like Tina's pussy, eat it up.
6072749	6075410	I'm going to get beat up for that.
6075670	6075910	Yum.
6077110	6081551	All right, here's a clip of that song in case you forgot what it sounds like.
6083092	6086393	I need to close all these excess windows first off.
6086833	6088933	Twins, stop messaging me.
6089634	6090094	Oh, whatever.
6091594	6095075	I need to close all these extra windows before we start the cage match so I can do quotes.
6099196	6100056	Okay, here we go.
6100476	6103637	Last week's winner, Apex Twin with Power Pill.
6103677	6104097	Here it is.
6146499	6147239	Orange Lodge Cage Match!
6178142	6180983	If you look around, everyone is in a hurry.
6181283	6183664	Somewhere, it's too far away.
6183784	6187265	If you notice this year, it will come to an end so soon.
6234004	6234634	Thank you.
6250703	6251363	Thank you for watching!
6306834	6307376	DarkSakura
6393210	6393851	Thanks for watching!
6433226	6434607	Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
6434627	6437990	I'm starting to get a little bit of my coherency back after drinking so much this show.
6438010	6438711	Should I make a new shot?
6438731	6440112	Yeah, I think I need another new shot.
6440493	6440813	No.
6441393	6446178	Okay, that was Yumi Hamasaki with M, the Above and Beyond mix.
6446218	6447178	What did you think of that, Jamie?
6447559	6448239	That was pretty cool.
6448259	6448980	I give it an 8.
6449260	6448980	8.
6449601	6451923	Brad, what did you think of Yumi Hamasaki with M?
6452703	6453704	Out of a scale of 10?
6454225	6454945	Yes.
6454965	6455846	I give it an 8.
6456266	6457047	I think Connected is better.
6457467	6457808	All right.
6458368	6458669	Loki.
6459898	6464660	I give it a 9 because I like all of her stuff and I can't judge you on which is the best.
6465100	6466041	Alright, explicit.
6466061	6467161	8.5 Any reason?
6471784	6474006	I don't know, I like Connected better, but this one's pretty good.
6474046	6474806	I like this very well.
6497643	6499124	and they were big a few years ago.
6499224	6502746	This song is called You're Not Alone here on Orange Lounge Radio's Cage Match.
6518594	6523437	In a way it's all a matter of time
6525814	6552937	I will not worry for you You'll be just fine Take my thoughts with you And when you look behind You will surely see a face that you recognize You're not alone I'll wait till the end of time
6554452	6574770	Open your mind Surely it's plain to see You're not alone I'll wait till the end of time for you Open your mind Surely the time to be with me
6586261	6595443	It is a distance that makes life a little hard Two minds that once were close
6657898	6658760	Thank you for watching!
6762859	6767181	Alright, boys and girls, that was Olive with You Are Not Alone on the Orange Lounge Cage Match.
6767201	6769282	A little slow for some of you, I think, I don't know.
6770242	6772283	Anyway, what'd you guys think about?
6772403	6773624	I give that a 9, I like it.
6773644	6774384	You give that a 9?
6774784	6775345	Alright, Jamie.
6775825	6776945	That's 10 all the way.
6777185	6780047	That song has, oh man, long time favorites.
6780327	6781307	Alright, cool.
6781667	6783048	Who else is back there?
6783068	6783548	I can't see.
6783888	6784789	Jonas, what'd you think of that?
6785489	6785849	I give it a 9.
6786049	6786729	I like it.
6786850	6787490	I like it very much.
6788331	6789711	Our chat room doesn't seem to like it.
6789791	6790191	It's weird.
6790251	6791772	We all seem to like it, but the chat room doesn't.
6792432	6793072	I like it.
6793132	6794712	I normally don't like things like that.
6795812	6796693	I liked it, too.
6796713	6798533	I like that one.
6799033	6799573	Let's see.
6800013	6800433	I give it a 10.
6800913	6801513	It ruled.
6802234	6804174	And if you don't like it, you can kiss my fat ass.
6804654	6809915	Okay, send your votes over a private message in the chat room.
6810975	6815016	And you can vote for either the Power Pill song...
6820548	6823070	Or you can vote for M, the Above and Beyond Mix.
6829916	6832238	Or you can vote for Olive with You Are Not Alone.
6836306	6841052	Send those votes over private message to me, Sky, in the chat room right now.
6841092	6844897	We'll tally those up and read them for you towards the end of the show.
6845277	6847740	In the meantime, we're preparing for a list list really fast.
6847780	6850924	The topic tonight, Jamie, tell us about tonight's topic for list list.
6851325	6853788	I need to name my car, and I don't know what to name it.
6855027	6861968	Um, the only thing I'm really going to do the outside of is put the little, you know, I, I right next to the DX on the back of my car so I can be 2DX.
6862568	6870670	But, um, so basically the way that you play this list is each of us lists our top three picks and everybody votes one off the island.
6872790	6876871	Okay.
6876911	6879051	You can work with somebody else who isn't playing, Tina.
6879111	6881692	If you're having a hard time, play with somebody else who isn't.
6884309	6892151	And see, that's the good thing is that Tina and Jamie don't know each other that well, so... Shut up back there!
6892251	6893191	I'm drunk, remember?
6893671	6895151	I've been drinking that, by the way.
6895511	6898692	If you're just tuning in, I have a three-day weekend, so I've been drinking a little bit.
6901032	6901652	Shut up!
6902713	6907234	Who's touching me?
6907414	6909094	Don't touch me, you're violating me.
6909864	6911146	Oh my god, my titty!
6911506	6911766	Okay.
6911786	6912988	You do it to me, I give it back.
6913008	6914289	Alright, we're going to take a really quick break.
6914309	6916812	We're going to take a two minute break with a song from 2DX8Style.
6917232	6920035	And we'll be right back with tonight's list list.
6920095	6921737	Things we're going to name Jamie's car.
6922117	6922578	We'll be back.

7092536	7094077	You guys are very close match tonight.

7096919	7098860	Let me think.
7099141	7104944	Alright, so I am, we'll be going into rotation on the Orange Lounge normal show.
7105565	7107646	Anyway, let's do tonight's list list.
7108247	7109948	Although I'm not even done with my list yet.
7109988	7111769	I was still trying to look up some names here.
7115051	7115692	Yeah, okay.
7116532	7117233	Rob's thinking.
7117553	7117793	I got it.
7117813	7119815	It's taking him a while, you know.
7120195	7121196	You're supposed to pick three.
7121256	7121897	Do you have three?
7121917	7122797	Does everybody have three?
7122837	7125459	I think the little gears in his brain... Jonas is still working then.
7125559	7129382	The gears in his brain are well greased, but there's no electricity going to them.
7129562	7130003	That's right.
7130263	7130763	Keep talking.
7130783	7131744	I've got to close some of these windows.
7132405	7133185	Words.
7133586	7134266	Talking.
7135107	7136047	I like to talk.
7136428	7137669	Um, what?
7137689	7140531	I don't know.
7143047	7144728	Is that why I'm smelling steam in the front room?
7144748	7146290	Because Rob is stinking?
7146930	7147671	That's exactly it.
7147691	7150213	But I thought it said he smelled like he's stinking.
7150333	7151594	Kiss my black ass.
7151614	7153075	Well, that too, but you know.
7153795	7154496	Rob, you stink.
7154516	7156638	I don't stink!
7156678	7158819	You'll have a black ass when I'm done kicking it.
7158919	7160200	Rob, you don't have a black ass.
7160240	7161602	I'm sorry to inform you of this.
7161862	7163283	You smell like roses.
7163383	7164904	No, no, no, no.
7164964	7167226	Rob will have a black ass after I'm done kicking it.
7167915	7168415	Can I help?
7168636	7168936	Yeah.

7232620	7235941	I named this after my favorite phrase on the road.
7236201	7238562	Move out of my way, bitch, or I'll run your ass over.
7242263	7245684	Rob gets to hear me say that, except I said move your old piece of shit car out of my way.

7397033	7399954	My vote goes for the Alan Rickman sex machine.
7405310	7408373	Loki's number one pick is the Alan Rickman sex machine.
7409554	7415540	And my number one pick, ladies and gentlemen, for things Jamie should name her car, I put K.K.
7415620	7416521	Cockmaster.
7421026	7423408	After the famous Animal Crossing character.
7423769	7424269	K.K.
7424329	7425710	Cockmaster, boys and girls.
7426545	7429911	Alright, so let's hear the list so far for things Jamie should name her car.
7429931	7434720	We have Outphase, Buzz, Move Outta My Way Bitch,
7435717	7447899	My Baby Mama, Vic Viper, Green Blaze, Propel, Nottingham, Lord Rickman, Max Cube, The Alan Rickman Sex Machine, and KK Cockmaster.
7450140	7455461	Alright, so now we've got to take one name off the list, starting with Brad.
7455541	7456941	What's coming off of the list?
7459862	7459962	Um...
7461519	7462319	Rob just said coming.
7464460	7466581	I'm gonna have to say Nottingham's coming up.
7466922	7468242	You cocksucker!
7468602	7469883	That name sucks.
7470223	7470904	You sucks.
7471304	7472985	Almost as bad as KK Copmaster.
7475386	7476506	Oh, no you didn't, bitch.
7476786	7479928	Alright, Jonas, you gotta take one of these names off the list.
7479988	7481349	I'm a nice man, let me see.
7481369	7487592	I don't even know what to take out, but... Oh, no!
7488852	7490113	Oh, Jamie vetoed it.
7491212	7492334	Jamie vetoed it.
7492955	7494478	You got to take something else off instead.
7496341	7496962	Screw that.
7498945	7501009	What's with move out of my way, bitch?
7501029	7501990	That's a long ass name.
7502050	7505015	All right, you take a move out of my way, bitch, or I'll run your ass over.
7505894	7506154	All right.
7506174	7510659	We're not going to say, like, oh, here's my move out of my wish, bitch, I'm going to run away.
7510719	7510959	Yeah.
7511620	7514683	That's more of what Jamie's going to say when she's driving the car, not the name of the car.
7514703	7516705	Precious, move out of my way, bitch, or I'll run your ass over.
7516985	7520048	All right, so move out of my way, bitch, or I'll run your ass over comes off the list.
7520068	7520349	My precious.
7521430	7522111	My precious.
7522771	7525733	Okay, Loki, what's coming off the list?
7526974	7527335	Coming.
7528756	7528976	Shut up.
7529296	7530177	Max Cubed.
7530697	7531698	Max Cubed.
7532538	7533419	It's coming off the list.
7533479	7534260	I'm sorry to hear it.
7535561	7545068	Alright, my pick for coming off the list, I'm sorry to whack Jonas twice in a row, but Buzz isn't really something that I don't think Jamie would want to name her car, so I have to take Buzz off the list.
7546110	7548472	So, we're left with a tiny little list here.
7548912	7549773	I know what my pick is.
7550033	7553015	And these are your choices, ladies and gentlemen.
7553075	7558658	And just because Jamie doesn't have to go with what you guys say, but you can send me your votes.
7558678	7560059	This is the unofficial secondary nickname.
7560079	7561681	This is the unofficial secondary nickname.
7561961	7563502	But these are the ones you can vote for.
7564122	7574469	Outphase, My Baby Mama, Vic Viper, Green Blaze, Propel, Lord Rickman, The Alan Rickman Sex Machine, or K.K.
7574529	7575350	Cockmaster.
7577351	7578712	Those are your choices.
7578732	7581955	You can send me your votes live right now in the chat room.
7583576	7587859	Just so the Asian Harry Potter knows, Buzz was taken off the list by me.
7588220	7588500	Sorry.
7590802	7594064	He voted for Buzz, but he can't vote for Buzz because I took Buzz off the list.
7594124	7595125	So, ha.
7597827	7598488	Suck me.
7598988	7599328	All right.
7599509	7600930	I'm not naming my car Suck Me.
7601030	7602391	Be beautiful.
7602961	7605503	No, you can't, Stressa, you can vote for Propel.
7605864	7609547	It was, it was, it was vetoed to take off the list.
7610028	7611829	Are you shooting things at my crotch over there?
7613731	7613991	Alright.
7616353	7620077	So, do we want to take a quick musical break while they vote, or do we want to just talk about something else?
7620197	7621038	Okay, quick musical break.
7621959	7622639	Any requests?
7623180	7624721	Um, yeah.
7625182	7628745	Um, play, um, actually, I'm,
7629804	7632287	I want to hear, Rob, Happy Hopper.
7632307	7633409	Do you want to hear Happy Hopper?
7633429	7634590	I haven't heard Happy Hopper in forever.
7634630	7636453	Because it's the theme to the show now, remember?
7637033	7639256	Yeah, but I want to hear Happy Hopper without the theme to the show.
7639336	7640878	Alright, we're going to do Happy Hopper.
7640919	7643682	That means you have a minute to send me your votes.
7643902	7644643	Yeah, play that too.
7645605	7646446	What else do you want to hear?
7646606	7646966	A minute.
7647387	7648108	A minute, okay.
7650811	7657818	Okay, we'll be doing those and we'll be right back here on Orange Lounge Radio where I'm a little bit tipsy tonight, boys and girls.
7658378	7658979	A little bit tipsy.
7659019	7659560	I've been drinking.
7763426	7764195	Thanks for watching!
7838035	7842817	From StepSquad to OrangeLabs, this PDR sucks!
7843177	7844257	Holla, all of you!
7844277	7845258	We want to win!
7845278	7845418	PS!
7845438	7846078	TTPO!
7854281	7855202	I need another drink.
7855682	7855902	No.
7856082	7857183	Come on, one more drink.
7857203	7858524	Alright, but let me mix you one.
7858624	7859444	Alright, mix me one.
7859764	7860845	Do you have any vanilla coke?
7861345	7862986	Vanilla coke with a vanilla vodka.
7863066	7863927	I think we're out.
7864087	7867549	Oh, there's some still left in this can, but you need to, like, carbonate.
7867669	7868850	It's probably a couple days old.
7869070	7869631	Oh, no.
7869651	7870371	It's gonna be gross.
7870411	7872272	If you take a look in here, there's something in here.
7872292	7872853	It looks bad.
7873033	7873233	Ew.
7873433	7874073	It's like mold.
7874393	7874454	Ew.
7874474	7876515	There's mold on the inside of the coke can.
7876555	7877215	Dump that shit out.
7877395	7877776	I will.
7879016	7879597	Ooh, whoa.
7879897	7880817	That's not expensive.
7880918	7881298	Really?
7882532	7885694	Anyway, um, the winner!
7892339	7893019	I guess, yeah.
7894380	7895882	Oh no, yeah, you can't.
7899044	7900205	It's gonna take a while though.
7901706	7903747	It's gonna take like an hour to wash, an hour to dry.
7904347	7904908	What do you wanna do?
7904928	7905588	Okay.
7906269	7906649	I'm sorry.
7907109	7907630	I'm sorry.
7909355	7910436	All right, we'll figure something out.
7910997	7911257	Okay.
7912898	7917642	The number three pick for something Jamie should name her car.
7918623	7919424	Outphase.
7922567	7922987	Beautiful.
7923648	7929553	The number two pick, and I'm quite disappointed this only ended up in number two, but it was a good showing anyway.
7929993	7932696	The number two pick for something Jamie should name her car.
7933176	7934858	KK Cockmaster.
7937981	7944628	The number one choice for something Jamie should name her car, the winner, Vic Viper.
7947812	7950475	Jamie, are you going to name the car Vic Viper?
7951896	7953738	I will name it something based off of Vic Viper.
7953778	7956621	I will name it Pentoro.
7956661	7957462	What exactly is Pentoro?
7957502	7959024	Is that the Parodius version?
7959744	7961064	Yes, from Parodius.
7962045	7970486	I mean, because the only other one would be, the only other character that I use in Parodius is Tadosuke, so I'll use Pintaro.
7971166	7973407	We have some good last minute suggestions come in.
7973427	7977848	The Nocturnal Penile Turcescence Max, what do you think of it?
7977908	7979208	The Asian Blazer.
7982669	7983449	Does she have a mic?
7983469	7985309	Do you have a mic?
7985329	7987650	I can't name it that because my card doesn't have a spoiler.
7989213	7990094	Uh, just Dick?
7990855	7991035	No.
7991375	7994618	Or best of both worlds, the Vic Vipers, Nocturnal Penile Intercessions.
7995019	7998022	You can call it the Dick Di... The Dick Diaper?
8001354	8003596	Alright, we got some time to kill here on the show.
8003936	8005757	We have to do the other thingy.
8006457	8007398	What, we want to do a match game?
8007698	8011221	No, our, um, our... Oh, we already did that.
8011301	8012121	Yeah, we did the cage match.
8012722	8015163	We need to talk about some, uh, Bomani-related things.
8017265	8019226	Oh my god, we really do have lots of time to kill.
8020043	8022245	Jonas, you're our guest tonight.
8023145	8025627	Any freestyles that we should be looking forward to?
8025647	8026507	Some freestyle routines?
8026527	8027208	What are you going to do?
8027228	8028148	What are you going to bust out?
8028569	8030030	What's your next freestyle that you're going to bust out?
8030050	8031651	That will be... Big Black Clock.
8032091	8033412	That will be classified information.
8033432	8034292	Big Black Clock.
8034352	8038255	You'll have to wait until another Sacramento tournament comes out to see another routine from me.
8038475	8039656	Big Jim Slade.
8040677	8041737	Down it, down it, Rob.
8042138	8043839	What the hell?
8044519	8044979	Rob?
8045780	8046921	That's more Midori.
8046961	8048181	You know how expensive that Midori is?
8048201	8048822	That's good.
8051105	8053766	Tell me that people are not going to freestyle drunk?
8054926	8056927	Oh, dude, Drunk Drunk Revolution, good stuff.
8057487	8058868	Drunk Drunk Revolution?
8058888	8060388	Okay, that's a new topic to talk about.
8060688	8061789	Drunk Drunk Revolution.
8061809	8064629	Well, this man is an expert at Drunk Drunk Revolution.
8064870	8072432	When they went to Vegas, what was it, the Star Trek experience, the Warp Core Breach, the, like, seven types of Bacardi?
8074152	8075553	It runs down the side of the thing.
8076133	8079114	Sorry, Jimmy was saying the Midori was leaking, and, yeah.
8081556	8082136	Drink it.
8082396	8083496	Drunk Drunk Revolution.
8083636	8086117	I know, just don't vomit on the pad, that's all I ask.
8086677	8087017	Please.
8088137	8088537	Yeah.
8088737	8090778	Actually, don't vomit on the memory card slots.
8090838	8092118	Don't vomit on the memory card slots.
8092838	8094858	You'll get some pukey edits.
8096099	8096759	Pukey edits.
8099799	8100379	Oh my god.
8101019	8105080	That last shot that I made for Rob was Malibu and Midori.
8105160	8105680	And Midori.
8106560	8108841	You are going to have a serious hangover, my friend.
8109341	8110101	Too much liquor.
8112105	8112865	What do you think about that?
8113166	8114286	Be money related.
8114306	8115387	Hold on, I'm killing something up here.
8116267	8117388	That wasn't what I asked you.
8119049	8120210	Shut the fuck up, bitch.
8121050	8121850	Oh, you dickhead.
8122691	8123291	Oh, no.
8123892	8124392	Oh, no.
8125092	8128074	Think about Drunk Drift Revolution, Drunk Mania, Drunk Drunk.
8128723	8153742	Paradise, Drunk Drunk, oh my god, Key Drunk Mania or whatever, Key Drunk Mania, look at the possibility that Rob would do, Drunk Drunk Reggae, is that what we said Matt, Drunk Drunk Reggae from Jamaica, Max Drunk, actually that's more like, probably high, smoking all that reefer, right now you guys, I totally feel like I'm at a rave,
8157720	8159901	Oh, yeah, I'm so fucked up right now.
8161362	8163063	Oh, God, give me a hug, crack.
8163083	8163804	Give me a hug.
8165085	8165925	Oh, you my bro.
8167206	8170568	Jamie, yeah, I need a hug.
8170828	8172029	What's up, DJ?
8172109	8174170	Excuse me, but I thought the word of the night was porn.
8175031	8176572	I wanted to rave, baby.
8177372	8178393	You're already raving.
8183253	8184494	Oh yeah, pornography.
8184814	8187296	Something I will not be experiencing for a long time.
8187856	8188696	Wah, I cry.
8189097	8193319	I thought you were supposed to let me know where I can get my man porn from.
8197782	8203085	Speaking of porn, when I went to church earlier today, the priest was all talking about porn.
8204586	8206447	What was the priest saying about porn?
8208294	8213677	How some of us were staring at the internet, looking at porn.
8213997	8219819	How some of us were looking at sexual desires of people in raves, parties, etc, etc, etc.
8219839	8222461	I don't know, he's all talking about porn in front of the little kids.
8222481	8223301	And how he likes it.
8223321	8231365	I'm not sure if priests actually do porn, but... It's getting hot in here, so take off all your clothes.
8233468	8235428	Oh, those pastors, those preachers, man.
8235628	8235828	Yeah.
8236008	8237329	They're sick motherfuckers.
8237349	8238709	Masturbation on the Holy Cross?
8238729	8239389	Oh my God.
8239429	8239749	Okay.
8239909	8240209	What?
8240549	8240889	What?
8242310	8243450	Or the wish cup.
8243810	8244470	That's blasphemy.
8244530	8246790	No, go to that site with the cross-shaped vibrator.
8247511	8247791	What?
8248551	8249811	The Jesus suppository?
8249991	8257732	No, they have vibrators, dildos, and one of them is the shape of the cross, and the other one is Jesus, and the other one's Mary.
8257752	8260713	God, I love you.
8262932	8264873	Can we talk about Mormonism with Brad?
8266093	8267674	I'll tell you all you need to know.
8272775	8276516	Matt is worried about hearing the words, Sky and Loki in the same.
8276556	8278877	Hey, Brad, what do Mormons think of gays?
8279697	8280678	We think you're great.
8281638	8286419	And the reason why is because it leaves more women to have wives with.
8286800	8288000	So we can have multiple wives.
8288020	8291321	There's more free women because of all you fags.
8294019	8294979	What about lesbians?
8295700	8296260	Lesbians?
8296340	8300641	Well, that's not so good, because then there's less women to have the multiple wives with.
8301322	8302062	Okay.
8302462	8304002	What do Mormons think of DDR?
8305703	8307244	Mormons created DDR.
8307424	8308724	This is what you don't understand.
8309164	8312846	Have you heard of the Illuminati?
8312946	8322069	When I die and have my... Wait, Brad, when I die and have my own planet, will I have DDR all over my planet if I'm a Mormon?
8322089	8322349	Oh my god.
8324671	8329135	You know, when I die, I always wanted to leave elaborate instructions of what to do with my body.
8329335	8331977	Like, so elaborate that they wouldn't be able to be done.
8333218	8338703	I want my ashes spread throughout the ventilation system of a major high-rise building.
8342707	8345189	Let me tell you something about Mormonism.
8345749	8347191	Here I go.
8348542	8349202	Wait, Brad.
8349862	8352243	Brad, this is what I want to know about when it comes to Mormons.
8353403	8355284	Tell us about the magical underwear.
8356664	8358024	Oh, the magical drawers?
8358304	8358624	Uh-huh.
8359505	8359725	Oh.
8360925	8361625	I don't know anything about them.
8362445	8364026	Come on, tell us about the magical underwear.
8364166	8365526	That's classified information.
8365586	8366106	Come on.
8367047	8368567	If you were to see me...
8369467	8374913	If you were to see me in my magical underwear, you would probably, like, you'd burn.
8375033	8375793	Your eyes would burn.
8375894	8379157	If you get skip marks in your magical underwear, do you go to hell?
8380918	8387225	No, you have to take them to the Christian dry cleaning center or whatever, and they take care of that action.
8388426	8394273	No, I know this is going to be so freaking dorky, but the movie Chicago, pretty good movie.
8394713	8397617	They had a reference to Mormonism in there that was pretty damn funny.
8398578	8399539	So everybody should go see that movie.
8401441	8404184	You guys should just go see that movie because it really kicks ass.
8404224	8406026	And there's this scene, like...
8406989	8412032	When they're doing a press conference, and then they cut to the scene, and it's just really awesome.
8412352	8418817	The choreograph, the makeup, everything about it is just... I still think that Dan has the best Mormon joke ever.
8419317	8420678	The Mighty Mormon Power Rangers.
8421278	8425181	You know, I hate the film industry and their horrible attempts at sequels.
8425581	8435027	For instance, they're making a sequel to Beetlejuice that's going to be Beetlejuice trapped in some sort of, like, netherworld place, and he meets up with the urban version of himself,
8435587	8440750	Possibly played by John Leguizamo or Chris Rock.
8440770	8442351	You mean like the Black Beetlejuice?
8443312	8444253	Yes, exactly.
8445713	8446254	You know what?
8446554	8448255	Chicago isn't a sequel to anything.
8448335	8450697	It's just a remake of a Broadway musical.
8451297	8452678	So, on you.
8459048	8466932	and all the main actors, Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger all do their own singing and dancing, which makes it just even more badass.
8467032	8468573	Oh, hey, that reminds me.
8469333	8481399	I actually found, because we get brochures from these really small studios at Mark, because my sort of boss right now, she used to deal with all the small studios that didn't have a rep.
8482000	8485642	So we got this one they're advertising for, Guys Gone Crazy.
8485942	8486262	I want...
8486582	8489263	Yes, and I'm buying you guys Eyes Gone Crazy.
8489323	8491583	It's really freaking cheap, so we're buying that.
8491643	8492203	Are they naked?
8492223	8496244	That and Girls Gone Triple X Wild.
8496364	8496924	I want that too.
8497324	8498845	I want that.
8500045	8502866	I want the girls one, but not the guys, because remember, men suck.
8503826	8504546	I want both of them.
8507447	8510267	Will we get to see some big black cock?
8510848	8511228	Maybe.
8512008	8512388	I don't know.
8513123	8525595	You know, did I tell you about the time when I was driving down past the movie theaters and there was the car that had the wax stuff written on the back shield that said, we're filming for Girls Gone Wild, show us your titties?
8527356	8528617	Would you have shown your titties, Jamie?
8529718	8530019	No.
8532481	8533602	They have the logo.
8533622	8537846	They have actual car decals and shit that they can put on there.
8539744	8540904	Are we done with this current topic?
8540944	8542284	Because I have an idea for what we can do.
8542625	8542865	Good.
8543245	8545225	I'm fucking hungry.
8545305	8547085	Let's take questions from the chatroom.
8547145	8547385	Yes.
8547785	8550806	Alright, so chatroom, you're going to ask us questions.
8551606	8556207	Anything you want to ask us in the chatroom, and we'll answer them on air.
8556407	8557347	Anything you want to ask us.
8557367	8560248	And remember, I'm drunk, so I'm going to be very open right now.
8560768	8562768	So ask us a question and we'll answer it.
8566069	8568609	In the meantime, I'm going to open up the mailbag and see if we have anything.
8570475	8572436	Well, we're waiting for some questions in the chat room.
8575438	8576278	Nothing personal.
8576338	8578779	They can't be about, like, a specific, like, other person.
8578799	8584522	They can be about one of the three of us, but they can't be about, like, why do we like or not like so-and-so.
8591573	8595315	Now, the only reason I wanted to go to the Rage... Oh, wow, I'm getting a ton of stuff over private message.
8595335	8595675	Hold on.
8596095	8605720	Anyway, I was going to go to the Rage tonight with Brad and Irene and everybody, but, you know, because I have work tomorrow, and we would be out until 2 in the morning.
8606621	8612944	I'm okay with, you know, being out that late, but, you know, I'm kind of tired right now because I haven't eaten anything all day, so I'm kind of indecisive.
8613224	8620608	But then again, the last time, you know, if everyone remembers my story, like last week, I think about the guy trying to, you know, proposition me for sex.
8620628	8625551	That happened on a Sunday night at the Rage, so, you know, I could go and get more material for the show.
8625851	8631754	So it's, you know, it's that whole, you know, weighing the situation there, but I don't know.
8632074	8635756	Plus, I might see that one... No, that'd be wrong, because then I'd be cheating on my girlfriend.
8635836	8635896	No.
8637257	8638658	Hey, you can always look at the menu.
8638719	8641742	I'm talking about this one chick that used to go.
8642303	8643043	Her name was Nicole.
8643063	8647288	She was the one that's like an ex-stripper, like has things pierced and that kind of thing.
8647949	8649631	She used to go to the Rage all the time on Sunday nights.
8650492	8650752	Hmm.
8651533	8652814	You should just go to faces on that.
8652974	8654135	I'm getting some material for the show.
8654235	8655576	I'm getting questions from the chatroom.
8655596	8656056	You guys ready?
8656277	8656677	Yeah, yeah.
8656697	8657217	Alright, here we go.
8657297	8657838	First question.
8657878	8661300	Should I get some music for answering questions here?
8661380	8661561	Barry!
8661601	8662481	Jill Sandwich.
8664403	8666044	I'm really dizzy right now.
8666084	8667665	You guys ought to forgive me.
8669006	8675311	If you're just joining us, tonight's the drunk show and I've been drinking a little bit, so... Yeah, I know.
8675371	8675791	Amazing.
8676672	8677212	Okay, here we go.
8677232	8678894	Okay.
8678914	8679154	Okay.
8680905	8681766	First question.
8683588	8685990	It was all hell.
8686030	8690054	Dwen wants to know, who is a real bonafide lesbian in the studio?
8692896	8696560	Well, since I said fuck all men, I might as well just go lesbian.
8696640	8699883	He handed the microphone to Tina like she's a bonafide lesbian.
8700512	8701973	Why are you a bonafide lesbian?
8702134	8702814	I will tell you the truth.
8702854	8705156	There isn't one bonafide lesbian in this house.
8705877	8707459	I'm a bonafide lesbian, okay?
8708359	8710021	Matt is a bonafide lesbian.
8710581	8711863	No, you're just a boner.
8712023	8715106	Maybe in an alternate universe where he had a sex change.
8716195	8716895	Message to Boner.
8717195	8719416	Okay, next question from Twen.
8719676	8721897	How come we don't talk about big white cock?
8722577	8724658	Because white people don't have big cocks.
8724698	8725719	Thank you, that's it.
8726559	8729200	They're up there with the Asian answer right there.
8729240	8729840	It was easy.
8730260	8730881	What the hell?
8730921	8731461	I'm Asian.
8732141	8735482	Twen also asks, am I sexy?
8735622	8737143	And he sends a picture of himself.
8737223	8741004	I can already tell you the answer is no, but let's open the picture just to humor him.
8741965	8743065	Is Twen sexy?
8743085	8744005	No!
8747796	8749297	That's better than the last pic I saw.
8749317	8752981	Being honest, he's not, I wouldn't say he's sexy, but he's not ugly.
8753622	8755363	He's got an old navy shirt, that's cute.
8755824	8756965	He has a chance.
8757926	8759327	I wouldn't fuck him, but whatever.
8759347	8760328	Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
8760528	8763391	Everybody stop, stop the show, stop the press, there's an announcement.
8764372	8765593	I cut the cola cam.
8766974	8769717	Can I suck your, Irene, I have a question, can I suck your dick?
8769897	8770397	Yeah, sure.
8771258	8772219	Too late, I already did.
8774062	8774482	Here we go.
8774602	8775223	Moving on.
8776504	8776844	Moving on.
8776884	8781327	Let's answer some more questions from the chatroom.
8781507	8783268	23 Magus wants to know, where is Mr. Spanky?
8783288	8785650	Mr. Spanky is on hold this week because he's not popular.
8785890	8789333	Mr. Spanky is actually chained up in Rob's closet.
8789413	8790373	Twin sent us another pic.
8790393	8791794	He wants to know if he's sexy in this pic.
8792715	8797498	Is that the same closet that holds his clothes monster in it?
8798099	8798419	Okay.
8798939	8799520	EOSFVB.
8799560	8799780	Question.
8800760	8801341	Question.
8802037	8804940	Daredevil, the movie, comes out on Valentine's Day.
8805020	8806341	Will it be a make-out flick?
8807562	8807762	No.
8808923	8810204	Yes, because it's incredibly boring.
8811365	8811805	I'd wish.
8812286	8819352	I don't think too many people are going to see it because that's a really fucking awesome comic as is, and I don't think they should make it a movie.
8820613	8824736	I would see it just from the nerdy thing, but I wouldn't go down and say.
8825657	8827278	I would wait until it came to DVD.
8829170	8830611	I don't think it's going to be a make-out flick.
8830631	8833131	I think it's going to be a blowjob in the back row movie.
8833152	8835492	I think it's going to be a vomit flick.
8836433	8836873	I'm going.
8839054	8840034	What, for the blowjob?
8840174	8842435	Or maybe just like a theater flick.
8844216	8845096	Okay, we have another question.
8846076	8850918	MoreThanJake543 wants to know, Why do my parents cry when I ask them questions?
8851818	8852979	That's because you scare them.
8853619	8855820	Yeah, take off the mask when you ask them questions.
8856445	8856945	Mughal Hunter
8886311	8890016	He says, Ula Ulazu, who's pointless?
8891117	8891438	You are.
8892699	8893240	Moving on.
8894061	8898347	Dark Tetsuya, Loki, how come you know so much about prawn?
8899910	8900270	I don't.
8900330	8903811	I just have this wonderful ability to make myself... I'm good at bullshitting.
8904731	8905991	That's what it is.
8906671	8911232	Other than that, I get a lot of Playboy videos just because of my work.
8911272	8912773	I get a lot of everything, actually.
8913713	8915813	But really, I don't own that much porn at all.
8916774	8922115	Everything I own, I've gotten from my work, so that's not saying much, but I don't know.
8922255	8925315	I just make myself sound like I know a lot more about stuff than I actually do.
8925516	8925956	It's pretty cool.
8926196	8926776	You fake it.
8928396	8929136	Like an orgasm.
8929596	8930537	I have had a cry.
8930637	8933017	You guys have drank almost all my Midori.
8933037	8935518	Do you want my butt?
8935998	8937658	Alright, next question.
8938498	8938938	Change that.
8938998	8942179	Chubbs wants to know, when is the next drunk show?
8943299	8943779	Tomorrow.
8945120	8946980	When I'm drunk and do a fuck off.
8947000	8949680	The next drunk show is President's Day, right?
8949760	8950981	Or the day before President's Day.
8951001	8951421	If I'm off.
8951801	8952521	If Jamie's off.
8953141	8953661	We can get you off.
8953681	8954561	Jamie likes to get off.
8954702	8956882	Which means that I'll be sleeping on the couch over here.
8958106	8958366	All right.
8958486	8959627	Just log in tomorrow.
8959707	8960667	We'll have a drunk show.
8961808	8963668	I might have to come for that drunk show.
8964169	8965849	I was actually just kidding to get them to log in.
8965869	8966650	We have another question.
8967070	8970831	CM Iguana wants to know, what's better, cherry or vanilla Coke?
8971492	8971872	Vanilla.
8974529	8977532	I think JB is now my god, if she can find me that.
8999597	8999937	All right.
9000417	9002938	CM Iguana also wants to know, am I sexy?
9002998	9003699	Here's his picture.
9004279	9006800	Hey, big black cock.
9007920	9008460	Amazing.
9008520	9009241	No, that was the link.
9009521	9010141	That was the link.
9010161	9010881	That's the person.
9010901	9015343	That was the link to uglypeople.com, and I'll post the link for all of you so you can have the shock that we just did.
9016003	9016343	Okay.
9017644	9018464	Next question.
9018644	9019225	There it is again.
9019265	9022566	It looks kind of like Mr. T. No, Mr. T looks better.
9023391	9024071	Subway Fatter.
9024392	9029335	Okay, the Asian Harry Potter wants to know, why don't you like bag?
9030255	9031416	That's a good question.
9031516	9032377	I don't dislike bag.
9032937	9035739	I don't like bag because it sounds like haggis.
9036359	9038160	No, I think Revenge is capable of much more.
9038220	9042663	It sounds, it's just, it's not very DDR-ish.
9042743	9045444	It's bagpipes and it's throw up.
9045665	9046245	I swear.
9046425	9047045	It's gross.
9047225	9048786	It's not my bag, baby.
9048826	9050367	Yeah, it's just not my bag, baby.
9050467	9051108	What can I say?
9053444	9054365	Well, what to expect?
9054925	9057086	Of course, revenge is all the multicultural people.
9057366	9058547	Damn it, I need a waffle.
9059788	9061028	I am hungry for waffles.
9061068	9061529	Here, have some.
9061549	9062449	I am buying waffles.
9062849	9063590	Have some waffles.
9063790	9064750	I'll go looking for waffles.
9065851	9066591	Let's go get waffles.
9067352	9069513	I need waffles after the show because we can't get alcohol.
9070494	9071254	How much, how many?
9072355	9072615	We got...
9073965	9075587	Yeah, we got way more questions.
9075607	9076728	We just got a ton of questions to go.
9076748	9077228	This is good.
9077869	9083934	Vidpower wants to know, Will you stick your cock into your GameCube and attempt to play Animal Crossing with your cock?
9085876	9086096	No.
9087738	9088118	Hydra.
9089319	9090280	Anybody else want to answer that?
9093837	9095038	It would never fit in there.
9095858	9099300	Hydra wants to know if we can see him in the tree outside our house.
9099900	9100640	You fool!
9100980	9102841	There are no trees in California!
9105502	9106543	I'm just kidding, no.
9109284	9111505	Okay.
9111665	9114106	23rd Magus wants to know, Loki, what the hell?
9114927	9115787	What the hell, Loki?
9115847	9117408	What is your line of work anyway?
9118835	9120396	I sell movies to video stores.
9120456	9124640	Actually, I'm... I'm... As she walks into the microphone cord.
9125080	9128623	I'm key account sales for a chain of stores called Movie Gallery.
9128683	9131526	It's a Midwest, East Coast chain.
9131546	9133147	It's kind of like Blockbuster in Hollywood.
9133508	9136370	And I talk to stupid shits that work at those stores all day long.
9137171	9141955	And I sell the movies and deal with issues that they have, like misshipments, shortages, whatnot.
9142515	9151318	So that's what I do, and because I do that, I get spiffs from different studios for selling movies to the stores, and I also get, um, you know, tons of movies for free.
9152758	9153238	That's my job.
9153738	9154358	Alright, cool.
9155079	9161080	JB wants to know, Will you play the song I sent, X1, Wet Wet Wet?
9161901	9162761	I'll think about it.
9164521	9164842	Alright.
9165522	9166222	More than Jake.
9168797	9171300	What's yellow and blue and at the bottom of the pool?
9172000	9173902	A baby with slashed floaters!
9177406	9180489	Why do you stick a baby into a blender feet first?
9181811	9183473	So you can see its expression!
9187449	9191850	Alright, that's right folks, kill your kids while they're young so that we don't have to suffer with them.
9191870	9192770	Alright, another question.
9193250	9199791	EvilNauki2DX wants to know, why do the dancing cacti from the background video of Guacamole Del Taco give me nightmares?
9201932	9203372	Because they're out to steal your soul.
9204092	9205912	Because they're playing Samba De Amigo.
9205952	9211853	Because after you play that song, you have seven days to live, and the last thing you'll see is the cactus.
9212934	9213614	Seven days?
9214054	9215354	Why not six days?
9216983	9217303	Whoa!
9217563	9218704	It doesn't park that way.
9220324	9220724	Anyway.
9223205	9226726	Stressa wants to know, Rob, do you think I'm sexy?
9227726	9229467	Yes, I think you're sexy.
9229547	9230747	Let's fuck right now.
9230827	9231427	Get over here.
9231727	9234328	Step into my office, because you're fucking fired.
9238596	9243919	Except you don't swing my way, so we'll never fuck, so I can joke with you like that.
9243939	9245420	Rob, when are we getting that apartment together?
9245740	9246160	Or house?
9246340	9250243	I don't know, it depends on the financial situation I'm in with this house.
9250263	9251083	Okay.
9251883	9252504	No styling!
9254028	9256009	Who is the head leader in Orange Lounge?
9256049	9257911	I mean, who's behind every planned show?
9258351	9258891	We all are.
9258951	9260272	It's a three-way.
9260953	9262674	It's myself, DarkSakura, and Loki.
9263654	9264375	We're a three-way.
9264395	9265276	We're a giant orgy.
9265696	9267197	I just don't have my own chair or mic.
9268498	9273401	His second question is, who's the most random person in the chat room?
9273501	9274121	Chat Cookie.
9274502	9277684	No, I'd say Maple, because he talks only occasionally.
9277724	9278925	Like, he just comes out of nowhere.
9278985	9279585	No, it's me.
9279605	9279925	Bam!
9279985	9280626	There's Maple.
9280646	9281026	It's me.
9282247	9283508	I'm the most random person in the chat room.
9284548	9284628	Hey!
9284648	9285329	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
9285349	9288770	Rob, when he gave you your Christmas present, you wanted to fuck him.
9288790	9289950	That's true, I did want to fuck him.
9315751	9319934	But I have respect for the... When I got my Christmas present, I wanted to fuck them.
9320995	9321935	My present.
9322376	9323656	More like the man in my present.
9324017	9325097	Oh, this is a good question.
9325538	9331742	Hydra wants to know... Hydra wants to know, is there a Santa Claus?
9335148	9339529	Yes, there is a Santa Claus and every year he comes and attacks our city.
9339549	9341630	That's why we have the Protective Dome.
9341650	9344251	It's from Invader Zone.
9349770	9351611	Those are little yellow-green pills.
9351651	9360296	Those are... So do I take the green pill, and I go to the Matrix, and then the white, yellowish pill, and I go... They're the same.
9360356	9363478	They're both yellow and green, and they'll just fuck with your head.
9365359	9368220	I bet the listeners love it when we're having two different conversations on each mic.
9368801	9369921	Alright, alright, new question.
9375364	9377326	I'm not allowed to tell any more dead baby jokes.
9377366	9377926	Stop sending them.
9379770	9385955	Naoki2DX says, does Love Love Sugar make you want to be all giggly like a damn schoolgirl?
9386095	9393661	Okay, before that question is answered, if anybody says any more dead baby jokes... Tina, I said I'm putting a ban on the dead baby jokes, don't worry.
9393922	9394482	I know you will.
9394963	9396524	And you can kick my ass, that's a sad thing.
9396564	9400107	Let's listen to Love Sugar real fast, just so you guys can be familiar with it.
9405037	9406258	Okay, I haven't heard it.
9406618	9408960	Alright, does that make you want to be all giggly like a damn school?
9408980	9410401	No, that makes me want to kill people.
9413623	9413903	Yeah.
9415024	9417465	Because I have a car now, I vote for vehicular homicide.
9417985	9420127	No, it just makes me want to look for more hentai.
9422268	9423789	It makes me want to... I hate hentai at work, too.
9423929	9425650	It makes me want to jerk off on your head.
9425831	9426651	I don't get that often.
9428993	9429473	I can buy something.
9432515	9433095	Moving on.
9440160	9441041	I think I'm getting pictures.
9441081	9442302	Here's a picture from Stressa.
9443102	9444503	Oh, that's a cute picture from Stressa.
9445464	9447125	That's a cute picture of Stressa and Angel.
9450927	9459413	And I think we have... Okay, that's one of Hydra's songs I promised I'd play later.
9459433	9460093	Ah, VidPower.
9460113	9461995	This is an excellent question from VidPower.
9462788	9467551	What is up with that guy sitting cross-legged in the stoic video for 2DX?
9468311	9469192	Dude, it's Tack.
9471594	9471894	Don't.
9472234	9472834	Question.
9473154	9473595	Tack.
9474775	9475216	Fair enough.
9475556	9475956	Fair enough.
9477897	9480659	Chatcookie wants to know if I want his chocolate chips.
9482080	9483001	Oh baby, you know it.
9485022	9489665	Hydra says, mmm, that's not a question.
9493435	9497657	Twen wants to know... No, I'm not going to dignify that question.
9497697	9499157	I'm sorry, that's a little bit across the line.
9500718	9501878	No, no more dead baby jokes.
9501918	9504859	Get over it.
9504939	9509021	JB wants to point out that the Ricky Martin song that's on DDREX is redone by SyFam.
9509061	9509481	Thank you.
9509781	9513282	By the way, go back to the fuck you music, because I actually do have a fuck you that I have to say.
9513302	9513902	Oh, Christ.
9514562	9515643	Let's see if I can find it.
9515663	9517103	No, this is in regards to JB.
9517643	9518244	All right, hold on.
9518304	9518944	I've got to find it.
9521249	9522593	uh... here it is
9532469	9542578	Okay, I put in an order at Half.com for Evil Zone because I'm generous and nice and I wanted to give it to JB because very few people appreciate that game the way that we do.
9543179	9545041	The person cancelled my order.
9545441	9546001	The fuck?
9546522	9547323	So you know what I did?
9547843	9549865	I ordered another one for just as cheap.
9551066	9552828	So, fuck them, I got another one.
9553708	9554089	That's all.
9557708	9566400	Okay Back to the questions More than Jake wants to know Oops, wrong song How many roads must a man walk down?
9566420	9570786	42 In a row Why can't I have an afro?
9570826	9571827	Is it because I'm white?
9572187	9573890	Yes Good enough
9575615	9576635	Get a perm.
9576695	9582477	Twin wants to know, what is it when I message him with an underscore and then a pipe and an underscore?
9582597	9583417	What is that symbol?
9583437	9586078	And I'll type it in the chat room for those that don't know what I'm talking about.
9586638	9587558	What is that symbol?
9588058	9589079	That's a middle finger.
9590279	9590739	I'm sorry.
9591319	9591699	I'm drunk.
9592720	9593500	Did you have a better explanation?
9593520	9594580	I have a better explanation, Twin.
9595180	9596941	Look at your hand, face your palm toward you.
9597461	9598461	Now turn it the other way.
9599181	9602382	Fold down your pinky and the finger next to it.
9602722	9604623	Fold down your index finger and your thumb.
9605343	9606784	This is what everybody is telling you.
9609405	9612366	Bombay wants to know, is the guy in the stoic video tack?
9612926	9613406	I think so.
9614147	9614787	That's the rumor.
9615387	9621630	23rd Magus wants to know, Jamie, would you hunt me down and kill me if I did the stoic video dance during a party?
9622530	9623490	Too stoic, of course.
9623691	9623911	No.
9625611	9625851	No.
9628587	9632131	Vid Power wants to know, do any of you know Para Para Dances?
9632932	9634894	Yes, unfortunately, I know about five.
9635795	9637016	I've got about seven now.
9639258	9639758	I do not.
9640879	9642541	JB says, tell Jamie I do not.
9642601	9644742	I just BS everything, para para paradise.
9645143	9647424	Alright, that's the end of the... JB, you're welcome.
9647464	9647945	That's it.
9648205	9649546	End of question and answer segment.
9649566	9649946	We're done.
9650947	9654029	Now we're going to play a Bomani original.
9654089	9655150	Actually, it's not a Bomani song.
9655190	9659433	It's an original work by Hydra, who's a new fellow that's been in our chat room lately.
9660454	9666636	And after that, we're going to play something from a group called X1, who JB tells me might be Papaya under a new name.
9666757	9667317	So we'll see.
9667797	9668417	We'll play that.
9668457	9670378	We'll play those, and then we'll be right back.
9670458	9671979	So we'll start this off on the original work.
9671999	9676420	This is DJ Hydra with Hydra's Wrath, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

10011097	10013779	This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.
10017681	10019402	That was jazz in that promo.
10019462	10021223	I want him to come back and visit.
10021263	10022063	He's cool.
10022083	10023804	I'm so tired because I haven't eaten anything.
10023904	10024705	I'm just like, ugh.
10024925	10027226	Well, you know some of the boys and girls are going over to Taco Bell.
10028107	10029508	I have a boycott against Taco Bell.
10029568	10030949	I know, Taco Bell gives me diarrhea.
10032149	10033250	I just don't like Mexican food.
10034232	10034852	Are you racist?
10035352	10036713	No, I just don't like Mexican food.
10037193	10037713	It's all good.
10038813	10040674	We're getting into the last stretch of the show.
10041054	10042474	I'm starting to sober up a little bit.
10042494	10044775	I'm still a little dizzy.
10044995	10046095	You want to make me another shot, babe?
10046796	10047756	Who are you on the phone with, Jamie?
10048716	10049876	Jamie's calling her man.
10050677	10051717	The man, Dan.
10053798	10054158	Okay.
10056818	10057138	Okay.
10057559	10058819	Wait, Jamie's going to get waffles?
10059707	10060989	Yeah, I'm getting waffles.
10061089	10062111	Are you and Jamie going out for waffles?
10062131	10063052	We're going out for waffles.
10063112	10063493	Where at?
10063974	10065596	Probably Denny's, it's the only place open.
10066117	10066738	Oh, that sucks.
10067439	10069302	I want to go out for waffles, except I'm going dancing.
10070069	10077213	I wanna go dancing, but I have to- I'm on the prowl, because I've been single for far too long, and it's time for me to get some nookie.
10078113	10080455	Because it's been- oh my god, when was the last time I got laid?
10080775	10084757	Um, not that we wanna talk about this on the radio, but I'm drunk, so it's okay.
10085838	10087239	Uh, shit.
10087879	10090180	Probably since, like, the end of September?
10090921	10091821	That's sad, huh?
10091861	10098024	Yeah, well, unfortunately, when I go to frickin' The Rage on, uh, Sunday nights, I don't know what it is, but it's like-
10099165	10101327	My ass is a magnet for horny gay guys.
10101407	10102388	I don't know what it is.
10103008	10103809	Oh, Loki.
10107652	10108173	Go, go.
10108233	10109474	Jamie spilled drink.
10111536	10116540	But yeah, I'm taking, so.
10116560	10118001	You're not down with the gay, though, Loki?
10118021	10119102	No, I'm not.
10119263	10120303	That's too bad.
10120484	10121144	That's alright, though.
10122746	10124187	Oh, shit!
10124527	10125328	I spilled on me.
10125408	10126609	What's in this drink, Jamie?
10130649	10131049	How is it?
10134151	10134831	Rob's wearing it.
10136832	10137393	Was it okay?
10138974	10139654	It was sticky.
10140434	10141455	I need to wash my hands.
10142896	10144597	Can you guys keep the show going while I go wash my hands?
10144737	10145657	Yeah, it tastes okay.
10146258	10146718	Sorry, Rob.
10146798	10150600	I'll make you... Rob looks like he pissed himself.
10151620	10155803	You do realize that's the chair that he spilled alcohol in and rubbed it off with his ass?
10157228	10157929	I've cleaned it off.
10158269	10159191	Haha, see sucker.
10161774	10164758	Anyways, yeah.
10165439	10169625	Um, we should, um, let's play a two person match game.
10170326	10173651	Um, Rob spilled blank on his pants.
10178286	10178646	Yes.
10179366	10179847	Stupid.
10179887	10182967	You gotta say, Rob got blank all over his pants.
10183268	10187269	When Rob was really drunk, he blanked all over his pants.
10190470	10191930	This is not going anywhere.
10192110	10192951	Chatroom, what do you say?
10192991	10193991	What did Rob do to his pants?
10194611	10196052	I already know what he did to his pants.
10196152	10197372	But this is a different situation.
10197452	10198112	We're pretending.
10198992	10199733	Ah, he's back.
10199813	10200493	I want waffles.
10200513	10201773	I want waffles too.
10202614	10204294	Dude, he's like fisting your ass.
10204734	10205654	He was fisting your ass.
10209696	10212897	I was out in the living room giving everyone a big hug.
10213937	10216438	I want to know, what did the chat room think of the drunk show?
10216458	10220620	Should we do this again or was this a big, fat, fucking train wreck?
10220940	10224401	I don't think we're ever going to do this again because this is too much of a train wreck.
10224421	10226202	This show had no organization.
10226262	10230044	I mean, the show as it is has no organization, but this was like even worse.
10230144	10231564	Jamie, stop making me drinks.
10234265	10235665	Alright, one more drink, that's it.
10236926	10238746	I need to know what the chatroom thought of this show.
10240206	10243247	Wow, they're actually liking it.
10243347	10244727	What is wrong with you guys?
10245627	10248988	Okay, what's in this drink, Jamie?
10251188	10251528	Drink it.
10254589	10254969	Drink.
10255989	10256689	You don't have any thoughts.
10257509	10259689	Stop pressuring me!
10259709	10262490	If you don't drink, you won't be cool!
10263317	10264838	Drink, drink, chug, chug, chug, chug.
10267120	10267521	Wait, wait.
10267541	10267901	Okay.
10268461	10274827	EOSFVB is suggesting... Suggesting... Shut your mouth.
10277109	10282153	He's suggesting that we should do an E-Tards episode where we all drop ecstasy and make out.
10282453	10283334	No.
10284995	10285396	No.
10285616	10286016	No.
10286837	10287618	Make out with him.
10287638	10288598	Make out with him.
10293045	10295866	One, two... Stop laughing!
10297727	10299707	He's laughing like a baby!
10299727	10300667	You laugh like girl!
10303048	10303348	Okay.
10303989	10304549	Down the hatch.
10305949	10306289	Breathe.
10306529	10306889	Breathe, Rob.
10306929	10308290	Rob, don't look at the chatroom.
10309070	10309650	Close your eyes.
10309950	10310370	Close your eyes.
10310390	10311131	Close your eyes.
10311231	10311631	Close your eyes.
10312371	10312671	Drink.
10318053	10318353	Okay.
10319633	10321594	Rob has the tingly, twitchy look.
10322768	10323609	Bitter beer face.
10324470	10325051	Well, how is it?
10326392	10327233	It tastes like funny.
10327774	10328134	Really?
10328975	10330136	That wasn't as good as the Midori?
10331898	10333180	It was fine.
10333280	10334762	I liked the last one better, actually.
10335082	10336123	Okay, the one with more peach?
10336163	10336484	Okay.
10337445	10340268	Chubb says that we promised we'd do a drunk show on President's Day.
10340308	10341229	He wants to come up here.
10342210	10342831	Okay.
10343860	10347482	He's hoping that if he gets drunk enough, that he'll have his way with me.
10347542	10348083	No, I'm kidding.
10349063	10349543	I'm kidding.
10349744	10350244	Can I watch?
10350684	10352185	I'm just trying to piss people off tonight.
10353065	10355927	Oh, VidPower wants to know when we're going to get a stripper on the show.
10358209	10358389	No.
10360070	10360570	I'm sorry.
10360750	10361010	No.
10361871	10362191	Rob.
10362751	10363051	Rob.
10363392	10363632	Rob.
10364532	10365033	I'm sorry.
10365573	10366453	But no, you too, Harry.
10369335	10370396	Meanie, I'll get a razor.
10373820	10375300	We'll get you some Aussie Nads.
10377381	10378301	Some Aussie Man?
10378401	10378641	What?
10379142	10379882	Aussie Nads.
10379902	10381402	Dude, I could go for some Aussie Man.
10381682	10383043	Do you know what Aussie Nads are?
10383223	10383683	No.
10384123	10384323	No.
10385463	10386984	It's... Oh, wait, Nads!
10387024	10388564	Yeah, that's the stuff that... Yeah, hair removal.
10388584	10389325	Yeah, I know what that is.
10389525	10391065	I just didn't know it was Aussie Nads.
10392966	10395466	I think Stresso wants to come up and get drunk on the next show, too.
10395486	10398707	Uh, yes, you can come, but only if I can have my way with you.
10398727	10400288	Just kidding.
10401920	10405122	I would pay to see that.
10405162	10408524	Now he also says that if you take a razor to your balls, it hurts.
10409625	10411746	I wouldn't know, I've never shaved down there.
10411767	10413908	Did you try to castrate yourself so you'd sound like a lady?
10413928	10417350	I know guys that do, but I just... You gotta really wonder how the porn stars do that.
10417370	10421333	There's some parts of your body... I don't know why they can't be sharp like that down there.
10421633	10425335	No, there's seriously some parts of your body that you just need to take what God gave you.
10425556	10427677	I knew a guy when I lived in Alabama who was a stripper.
10428638	10430259	Who was an epilady.
10430339	10430639	Was he gay?
10432754	10433174	Was he hot?
10433535	10434255	He was the one I dated.
10435795	10436696	You dated a gay guy.
10440817	10441378	Okay, go on.
10442378	10443278	I'm hot, tell me.
10443538	10444379	He was an epilady.
10446199	10447100	You know what an epilady is?
10449120	10455983	It was back, they had these, they stopped making them for a while because it was, no, it was called an epilady.
10456023	10461225	It was like an electric razor, only it had these little wires coming out with coils wrapped around it, and it plucked the hairs out.
10462122	10462842	Just plugged him out.
10463723	10470026	And, yeah, I tried using that thing on my ankles for a while and I would get ingrown hairs because the thing was so shitty.
10470546	10473348	Could you imagine if you got ingrown hairs on your balls?
10473388	10474808	That would be the worst thing ever.
10475469	10477149	Yeah.
10477169	10478870	Um, what was I going to say?
10479050	10480231	I have Jackass the movie.
10480531	10482652	Someone mentioned we should do a Jackass video.
10483172	10483893	I've got the movie.
10483913	10484793	Fuck Jackass the movie.
10484953	10485434	Fuck it.
10486514	10489095	What was the... He's like a toy car possessed.
10489175	10489996	Is that the fortune cookie?
10491400	10491860	I think it is.
10495604	10496064	Excuse me.
10500889	10502290	I think we're towards the end of the show.
10502370	10506094	I think it's time to take everybody's... We're there.
10506134	10510899	Let's go around the room and take everybody's final thought of the day.
10510939	10511900	Shut up, woman!
10514662	10515243	Are we there yet?
10515483	10515843	Are we there yet?
10515863	10516224	Are we there yet?
10516244	10517164	Are we there yet?
10517244	10518385	Well, I haven't spoken much on the radio.
10518406	10518806	We're not real radio.
10518826	10520087	We're not real radio.
10520367	10520928	We're internet radio.
10539292	10540833	Okay, just to say that.
10541173	10542614	Most of this show is like mainly drunk.
10543715	10546557	Drunk revolution or something like that.
10546577	10553182	With you drinking all the... Yeah, Rob was just straight funny on this one.
10553842	10554403	Hyrule.
10558245	10559226	I haven't made out with anybody.
10559566	10562208	Maybe when I go to the club I'll get to make out with some folks.
10562228	10562729	That'll be fun.
10562949	10564630	Yeah, I did get to grow boobies, so thank you, James.
10565999	10580512	Let's see, since I can't be on the show Sunday, or next Sunday afterwards, depends on my schedule, but my upcoming school that's starting right now, it's about to start on Tuesday, well, I'll probably be there next February.
10585276	10588639	Alright, and let's see, thoughts about today.
10593331	10594011	All right, Dead Air.
10594731	10596212	Jonas, if you think of anything else, we'll come back to you.
10596432	10597152	Okay, I'll come back.
10597232	10597832	Just come back to me.
10597913	10599813	Loki, your final thoughts of the day.
10601514	10607075	I need to stop playing Animal Crossing and finish my website so I can get stuff up for people to download.
10607215	10607896	I knew it.
10608236	10609976	I knew it was Animal Crossing.
10610016	10610737	It was doing it to you.
10611457	10620580	Speaking of websites, Loki, I need to know your AOL messenger screen name so I can send some of my DWF files to you sometime.
10622887	10625329	This website has an uploader on it.
10625369	10626109	You can do it yourself.
10626129	10627250	Alright.
10628570	10629571	Alright, that's cool.
10629751	10630512	I'll accept that.
10634674	10636075	Yeah, we need strippers on this show.
10636235	10646421	Actually, I need to make a trip over to the strip club, because it's been a long time, and I was actually reading reviews last night of strip clubs, and supposedly, um, school club centerfolds, you get the steamiest lap dances there.
10648362	10648963	Strippers?
10649003	10650704	I can hire a few people, a few strippers.
10651923	10680841	We need to do Orange Lounge Live from the strip club Wait till I'm not here Okay, Orange Lounge Live from the strip club I'm sorry, but I would rather see real boobs than fake boobs I think that real boobs are better I'll just get some people with real boobs If I can touch it, it's real enough for me It's like that same story Your breasts feel so weird Because they're real I've actually touched real boobs and fake boobs before Is there a difference?
10681758	10683301	Well, thank you.
10683422	10684564	Yeah, definitely.
10684845	10685306	Of course.
10685326	10690717	Well, I know for a fact because we took... I took pictures before with... There's these two models from...
10692259	10697465	Some bike magazine, like, when we went to Harley Davidson's show, they had, like, some bike there.
10697805	10699547	Easy Rider show, that's what it was.
10699567	10708036	We took a picture with the Easy Rider, some of the couple girls from it, and their breasts were all fake and stuff, so they had, you know, they were sitting on my lap and stuff.
10708416	10713682	And you can tell they just feel, like, a lot firmer, like, a little unnaturally firm.
10714202	10714463	It's just...
10715263	10718184	I don't know, it's just not soft, it's just firm.
10718745	10722566	Is it like the difference between a waveless waterbed and a regular waterbed?
10723647	10728709	I've just had a regular waterbed, so I would imagine probably, yeah.
10730630	10732491	Well, I haven't touched bricks for a while.
10735393	10738735	But I hear now, though, they have the ones that, you know, they do feel natural.
10738795	10740897	I've never felt that way.
10741817	10748081	I'm never going to have a need for any type of enhancement, so I have to ask these questions I'll never find out on my own.
10748882	10750022	Yes, just stay natural.
10750403	10760349	My girlfriend, she's still got, like, you know, issues with her self-image, where she thinks she's... She says she wants to get her boobs done, and I was like, no, you don't need to.
10760649	10760809	Why?
10760829	10761470	What's wrong with her boobs?
10761490	10763311	If she put on 10 pounds, she'd gain more boobs.
10764171	10764792	What's wrong with the boots?
10764812	10765573	She doesn't want to do that.
10765613	10768395	She wants to be thin with bigger breasts.
10768435	10772299	I'm saying she doesn't need to do that, but she wants to.
10772800	10773180	Go ahead.
10773260	10774101	I'm not going to stop her.
10775222	10783290	You know, actually, from my experience working at GNC and everything, there are actually some herbs that you can take that increase your hormones, that increase breast size.
10784491	10785272	We all know about that.
10785512	10787514	She's taking enough drugs as it is right now.
10789013	10789793	It's all natural.
10790454	10793375	We're running long, so I just need to get everybody's final thought.
10793515	10794535	Are you done with your final thought, Loki?
10794996	10795216	Yes.
10795516	10795836	Jamie.
10797937	10798737	Um, bye.
10800658	10804460	My final thought is I'm drunk as fuck and we're not going to be doing this again for a long time.
10804860	10805780	Chubbs, you suck.
10805800	10809282	You were supposed to be here drinking with me, but no, I understand the poor thing because I'm poor too.
10809882	10812083	And, uh, that's it for now.
10813204	10818326	I'm actually, I might get really drunk tonight when I get home and go live until 2 a.m.
10818968	10819328	Oh, wow.
10820229	10826614	I said actually the station is going to be live until... Well, you'll have to try and kick me off, I think.
10826974	10829896	But I'm going to be going out, so... When I get back, though, you can go live, I don't know.
10831518	10832298	Anyway, well, let's see.
10835601	10836201	Alright, anyway.
10837182	10838383	Yeah, I think that's it for now.
10839504	10840004	Anything else?
10841005	10841686	Not that, no.
10841746	10842466	Everything's fine.
10842626	10844848	Alright, hope you enjoyed the drunk show, boys and girls.
