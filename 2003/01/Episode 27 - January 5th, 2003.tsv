3150	4031	Message for you, son.
4451	5412	Attention!
6333	9817	Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
11839	16865	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
20522	23424	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
23765	26947	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
27507	30229	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
30770	33672	Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
34452	34873	Just kidding.
35073	36654	Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
36874	44320	In this episode... Hey, are there any boys down there?
44600	47042	That's the biggest bear you've ever seen, Jingleberry.
47142	48483	What's your favorite scoop?
50299	50859	Showgirls.
51780	52640	Absolute fright.
53201	53761	What's yours?
54021	56483	There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
56543	57784	Don't torture yourself.
58424	59264	That's my job.
59345	61166	Now's the time our sprockets bend me dogs!
61246	64328	I'll get you, my pretty.
64528	65888	And your little dog, too.
66269	67169	I know Kung Fu.
67549	69891	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
70191	72052	Why did they have to take the word gay?
73653	76095	Nobody expects a Spanish exposition.
76395	77395	Yes, you do.
77836	78036	Yes!
80236	82057	DarkSakura Shut up!
82237	82917	Where's my gun?
83057	85018	This is my boomstick!
85459	87980	Sky Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!
88300	92022	Loki I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.
92082	94863	What kind of warped human being would find that funny?
95123	96504	Orange Lounge Radio
99048	105191	You are tuned in to the Bimani Scene's most stylish radio station of all things Bimani.
105311	106491	It's cute and lovely.
106851	110633	We are live, and this is episode number 27 for January the 5th of 2003.
110973	113274	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
113634	118577	Joining me as always are my awesome, wonderful, stupendous, and bouncy co-hosts.
118737	122158	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.
122178	123139	And that's our bell.
123759	125720	In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.
126587	127471	I'm not bouncing.
127953	129581	I don't know what the hell you're talking about there.
129882	131248	I saw your chi-chis, they were bouncing.
132936	138738	Also with us tonight, holy shit, we have got, seriously, probably the biggest show yet.
138838	140999	We have so many people in studio, it is crazy.
141079	144540	It is the first show of the year and everybody's here to celebrate.
144660	146100	Let's go around the room and say hello to everybody.
146560	153362	First up, say hello to the one and only chat room, I think the most active person in the chat room quite possibly, recently.
154163	155123	Say hello to DDR Angel.
157544	160785	And with DDR Angel, it's her bro, say hello to Stressa.
161085	161705	Hello.
163587	166008	In the back there is Jabberwocky.
167108	168649	I just came into the room for a ruler.
171130	174411	Next to Jabberwocky is 23rd Magus is here in the house.
174711	177752	Yo, 2, 3, M up in the his house.
178052	178432	Okay.
178913	179813	Brad's back there.
182725	185846	and also say hello to Irene.
186146	187886	Oh my god, Jamie's so amazing.
187926	189927	She gave us the Harry Potter set.
190107	191127	Harry Potter.
191788	192448	Oh my god.
193208	194468	What the hell did you just say?
195509	198769	We do not have enough microphones to cover all this shit going on in here tonight.
198889	201430	Hell, Rob doesn't have enough flows to cover what's going on tonight.
202350	205031	Come see me when you're not busy, Jamie.
205251	207312	Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we may have monkey sex.
208092	211273	Yes, Rob is not wearing any pants, thus my need for a ruler.
213934	214334	All right.
215135	215836	We're going to come back.
215856	216737	It's a huge show.
216877	221261	We've got interviews from the SoCal trip Loki and I took over the weekend.
221781	224043	We might do match game live in studio tonight.
224204	224764	And my nuts.
225244	226526	And we've got Jamie's nuts.
226706	227386	All after this.
227487	228367	It's the MP3.
228908	231510	You've all been coming over from extreme.
231911	232471	Or you haven't.
232711	235194	It's the Legend of Max here on Orange Lounge Radio.
235234	235474	Enjoy.
298579	299627	Thanks for watching!
361058	361838	Black Joe!
361858	362278	Black Joe!
362298	362618	Black Joe!
362638	362899	Black Joe!
391344	392485	Oh my god!
392525	394225	You've got mail.
394285	399448	During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative and
418758	420839	You bastards!
421280	427124	You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you.
427284	433228	I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough whopper.
433328	435149	Please, good people, I am in haste.
439351	442313	You are in the dark black forest of Orange Lounge Radio.
442433	442834	Here we are.
443641	446262	Big, fat house tonight, filled with people.
446302	446883	This is crazy.
446923	448103	I'm fuzzy and full of nuts.
451024	454446	Some new promos this week, thanks to the lovely DDR Angel and Stressa.
454466	455747	You guys made some new promos for us.
456147	457547	What was going through your mind when you were making those?
457587	459228	Why did you decide to make promos?
459268	460569	What's up with those?
460849	463390	It was just random, and hey, look, it sounds good.
463890	464771	All right, sounds good.
465471	466251	Hi, Angel, how you doing?
466512	467232	No comment.
469073	471254	I'm losing you, Carmen, because...
472094	473115	Wait, what was I supposed to say?
474876	481541	Alright, first off, as I promised in the chat room, tonight we are bringing back the word of the day.
482181	484142	You remember when we did rave and we had the sandstorm?
484743	487565	Jamie, tell us all about tonight's word of the day.
488826	491087	Um, I think we decided on this one.
491548	493109	The word of the day is slut.
493609	494810	The word of the day is slut.
495150	497772	And whenever we say the word slut, you get this.
500922	506327	The biggest slut in the world, Paula Terry.
507187	510410	I don't want to hear Paula Terry over and over and over again.
510910	511191	No.
512292	513413	So just don't say slut.
513753	515214	Oh, you said slut.
525527	525888	J.B.
525928	526528	will kill you.
529149	532951	Okay, so now you all know the word of the day.
533092	536373	And we're allowed to do that now because the band, the year's over, so the band's over.
536453	538474	So we can play Apolitary as much as we want on this station.
538515	539395	Let's enact a new band.
539875	540536	You want a new band?
541136	542197	Be Apolitary for another year.
542417	543417	Yay, okay.
543437	545798	Apolitary is banned from Orange Lounge for another year.
546439	547339	Maybe, we'll think about it.
547359	547980	Maybe, we'll think about it.
548000	548520	We'll consider it.
550041	550341	All right.
550661	554102	You've got to say things into a mic, or else they don't hear it on the radio.
554463	555283	All right.
555503	556003	Sharp object.
557043	557243	Word.
557323	558644	Or a pointy stick.
559164	561165	We need to go back to a time warp here.
561185	562085	We need to go back to two weeks.
562245	566666	Jamie, by the way, lovely job last week.
567027	568567	I didn't hear the whole show.
568587	569847	I heard bits and pieces.
570148	572088	I didn't hear that because of all the propelling.
572108	572368	You know what?
572388	572948	I get the same problem.
572968	575349	When I drink Propel and play DDR, that's like instant pee.
575409	577510	I went through three bottles of Propel that show.
579420	580300	Were they all berrylicious?
580800	581100	Uh-huh.
581220	581701	Alright, cool.
581721	583281	I have nuts stuck in my teeth, sorry.
583441	584081	Whoa!
584981	585362	Whoa!
585502	586022	Me too!
586062	587122	How come we haven't heard from Loki?
587162	587662	Where's Loki?
589383	590023	Oh, you're right there, okay.
590043	594664	That's because I don't have a chair, and I'm sitting on the floor without a mic.
595844	597425	I thought you liked getting to pet the rug here.
599585	601106	That's a wrong rug, I think.
602086	602886	Don't you like petting rug?
605555	605875	Yes.
606036	606496	Okay.
606957	607718	Are you a road muncher?
607738	610662	We need to time warp back to two weeks ago.
610702	611483	We did the last show.
611803	612524	Only on the weekends.
612965	614607	Oh, then up came the weekend.
614647	616008	Loki and I, we took a little road trip.
616669	617871	We went down to SoCal.
619052	619833	Bitches.
619853	620855	Bitter table of one.
622076	622437	Bitches.
624296	629118	We went down to SoCal and we were there and we have a little summary of it, right?
629158	630078	We're going to play this bit?
630239	630459	Yeah.
630659	632599	Alright, let's see if this works here.
632880	636821	Our live piece, well not our live piece, but our somewhat live piece, a week delayed.
636961	638022	I don't want to know about your piece.
639742	640883	I'm going to go back to eating my nuts.
641183	643984	Anyway, enjoy this bit from SoCal.
644024	644704	I can never reach.
644924	646225	First here on Orange Launch Radio.
648314	650715	So here it is, the taped garbage part of the show.
651496	656478	And as you may or may not know, last week, Loki and I decided to take a little trip.
656858	658599	And we decided to visit Southern California.
658939	660640	And with me here, of course, is Loki.
660840	661260	Say hello.
661280	662141	Hey, everybody.
662741	668944	Now, describe for us, Matt, since I'm not a very good speaker, what kind of place are we at right now?
670149	670629	DarkSakura.com
692751	694232	Yes, overpriced games.
694712	696873	But they had a, what was that derby game?
697953	699014	Derby Owners Club.
699394	700794	The hot new Milpitas game.
701555	702155	It was fun.
702375	704996	I jacked someone's horse, so that was kind of cool.
705656	706397	Horse Breeders Club.
706437	707597	He stole my horse!
708017	710038	Come back here with my horse!
710719	711739	So, that was kind of fun.
712559	716481	And then we just saw Die Another Day, which was a giant penis.
717532	723894	Yeah, but before they had even worse freaking previews of movies that were just going to really suck ass.
724454	727455	Movies started at 2, the actual film started at 2.30.
728236	728976	Let's put it that way.
729716	731377	Awful, awful, awful.
732197	733938	So what other kinds of crap have we done this weekend?
734138	735338	We've been and we've seen all the sites.
735438	736999	We went to CyberZone yesterday.
737159	739719	We went to Arcade Infinity last night.
740100	741180	What other kind of junk have we done here?
742145	745907	I went to Japan Arcade, got to play Beat Me at 3, so that was kind of fun.
745967	752251	Played lots of Pump It Up, played a game that's a Korean knockoff of Dance Station 3 DDX, which was pretty fun.
753152	753972	Got to try that out.
754152	755813	You played 8th style and 7th style.
757469	758770	Poppin' Music owns you.
758790	761612	It's giant seizure lights for your pushing pleasure.
788493	790535	I'll stick with Crackin' DJ.
791356	791796	Crack.
792296	802645	So, anyway, one other thing that we've gotten to do this week is we got to visit an old friend of the show, an old buddy of the show that's been listening, I think, ever since the very first episode, if I'm not mistaken.
802745	803786	No, since the third episode.
804587	804907	I don't know.
805207	806669	Nobody listened to the first episode, huh?
806689	807129	I forgot.
807149	808590	Yeah.
809331	810512	Anyway, say hello, everybody.
810872	812273	It is the one, the only, SoCalKicks.
812694	813374	Hi, everybody.
814075	814135	Um.
816118	816639	What is up?
816859	817639	What is up, my brother?
817679	818279	How was your day?
819240	821861	A blast, especially seeing everything I just got.
822321	826083	Ah, yes, the recipient of some lovely partying gifts from Orange Lounge Radio.
826363	829425	Actually, it's from Loki, but, you know, it's part of Orange Lounge Radio, right?
829505	830005	Yeah, yeah.
830745	831486	Yes, yes.
831806	837088	The prize pack, and what lovely things do we have in the prize pack?
837929	842531	The only two things I know they give out, movies, anime DVDs, and porn.
844625	846806	So, he didn't even have to make an edit to get that point.
846826	847346	That's amazing.
847526	848066	How do you feel?
848646	849087	Great.
850227	851948	What was this you were telling me?
852408	856009	You were mentioning that you're walking away here with like 20 DVDs or something.
856029	857529	Well, maybe not 20, but like 10 at least.
858150	859550	And what's this about?
859650	862211	You don't even own a DVD player or anything?
862251	863151	Or you own a DVD player?
863371	864052	What's this going on?
864572	865972	I don't own any DVD movies.
866052	870214	I rarely rent some, but now I have something to use my DVD players for.
870974	873955	You can watch such fine films as Blue Crush.
875032	876093	and Undercover Brother.
877394	878494	Amazing films there.
878855	879515	Yes, I'm sorry.
879595	882257	Remember, you only need one hand to use a DVD remote.
884258	885259	Chirp, chirp, blink, blink.
886099	886780	If you got porn.
889722	890042	Ha!
890362	891103	Joke's on you.
891263	892744	It was VHS porn.
895325	898027	You still only need one hand to use a VHS remote.
900369	900909	Back to the table.
902116	902616	Can't wait!
903477	906980	Alright, so, you know, here it is, your chance, you finally get to be on the show.
907500	909241	What kinds of things do you have to say for the listeners?
910062	911803	Um, nothing much, actually.
912824	916467	Well, you sure talk a lot in the chat room, and now that you have your chance, you don't have anything to say now?
916707	919349	Or should I say, and you don't have anything to say now?
920129	920810	No, I don't.
921911	923332	You don't talk that way in real life, by the way.
923352	924573	You promised me you would, and you don't.
924993	926154	I don't talk much in real life.
927390	927831	Amazing.
927891	931174	Most people you meet from the DDR community don't talk much.
931254	933035	I hardly ever talk much.
933296	935338	Unless there's a microphone in front of me, I don't talk much.
935358	936098	Shut up, bitch.
936999	937379	I don't know.
937399	937900	It was fun.
937920	943025	We got to play Max 2 in the middle of a theater and watch people go, What are they doing?
943565	945026	What are they stepping on the arrows for?
945327	946087	How do you do that?
947289	950852	That brings me back to the stupid people that I've seen up in NorCal.
952896	959021	Now unfortunately, the one, the only, the fabulous DarkSakura couldn't be here with us tonight because she has that little thing called work.
959101	961082	So, do you have any messages for Jamie?
961202	961983	Anything you want to say?
962783	964565	I still need my GameCube pen, please.
967307	969088	I'm going to give Jamie a minute to chime in here.
970189	971510	Fucking GameCube pen.
972470	972871	Okay.
974892	975673	The GameCube pen.
977145	979207	I don't know what happened to it because I had it for so long.
979548	989057	However, if I can't find it, I can give you a PS1 keychain clip pen.
990198	990418	Okay.
990619	991479	Well, let's get back to the tape.
992160	992500	Okay.
993882	999788	And in case she didn't say what I think she said, she's going to say, you haven't emailed me the proof yet.
1001946	1002406	That's right.
1002446	1005188	Now, where is this proof that she speaketh of?
1006188	1007589	I lost my Dexterite, sorry.
1009209	1010890	Oh, well, I think she lost her GameCube pen.
1010910	1011811	What do you have to say about that?
1012811	1017233	Hey, I was right.
1018114	1019374	So, let's see.
1019454	1022476	What else can we talk about here in the little SoCal segment?
1022656	1024897	What are we going to do with the rest of the time here in SoCal?
1025706	1031447	Well, one thing we're going to do tomorrow is check out AI, because it's rumored that they're going to get DDR Extreme there, so hopefully they will.
1031467	1038689	Rumor, rumor, just like it was rumored that, uh, what was it, CyberZone was going to get it yesterday, and obviously it wasn't.
1040509	1041589	Omaha, Nebraska.
1042089	1044650	Freaking Omaha, dude.
1046530	1049051	If I ever have a band, I'm naming it freaking Omaha.
1050431	1054612	Instead of Max 2 and the Aussie Landers, this time we got Extreme and the Rednecks.
1056894	1057354	Yeehaw.
1058896	1061458	I'm just, I'm not very happy with that.
1062319	1065862	But hey, we got our 2DX machine when we come back, so that's kind of cool.
1066502	1070826	And there was a fellow from Omaha that came out to shaft, so you know, he wasn't a redneck at all.
1070846	1076491	He was a very cool guy, so I'm happy for the, I'm happy yet insane with jealousy for those folks in Omaha.
1076591	1077092	What can you say?
1078266	1078666	Not anymore.
1078826	1081968	And I got to see definitely a bunch of cool stuff.
1081988	1085269	You know, that one mall we went to was pretty sweet in Little Tokyo.
1085989	1089691	And I got to spend money and I bought models and cool stuff.
1091454	1092334	Cool.
1092394	1095756	Any words of advice for things we should do while we're in SoCal or the places we should go?
1095836	1098317	As you are the resident expert right now, at least out of the three of us.
1099457	1100718	This isn't the biggest mall.
1101218	1104639	You still haven't been to some of the biggest malls we have around here.
1104659	1106600	You should go to The Block.
1106640	1107841	You should honestly go to The Block.
1107861	1108661	That place is huge.
1108841	1111382	Okay, but what other mall has a giant glowing phallic symbol?
1113203	1113523	I don't know.
1114286	1120710	There's this giant glowing green thing, and oh my god, now it's red, and it glows, and it looks like... And look at the little tip!
1121331	1125254	It's even got a little tip, and... I took some pictures, though, while we were down here.
1125614	1126134	Oh, cock!
1126474	1129176	I gotta mention, this really cool game I played yesterday.
1130697	1136501	Okay, this game involves a monkey running around on a grid, undressing a woman.
1137822	1138963	I know how weird that sounds.
1139023	1140004	That was a fucking badass game.
1140024	1140164	But, uh...
1141249	1142150	It was so addictive.
1142250	1143570	It was better than DDR.
1144271	1146212	Anyway, it was really cool.
1146232	1146852	It was a lot of fun.
1146892	1151775	And afterwards, you get 15 seconds to zoom in and Google the woman.
1152356	1152576	Yeah.
1153656	1153876	Fun.
1155277	1155557	All right.
1155577	1158399	We better wrap up this segment and get back to the real show.
1158479	1163442	But we have to ask SoCalKicks, because we always ask the hosts of the show whenever it's over.
1163822	1168625	We always go around the three of us, and we always say our final thoughts of the day and any guests that happen to be in the studio.
1169503	1172506	So I'm just going to ask us, what are your final thoughts of the day?
1173367	1174689	Loki gives the best hookups.
1176371	1179033	He also gives the best, never mind, we're going to go back to the show now.
1179074	1179374	Good night.
1180180	1182702	No, we... Hey, hey.
1182962	1183262	Alright.
1184863	1185924	Um, yeah.
1186705	1189527	I think I said something like, uh, no, I do not.
1189687	1191088	I don't know what you're talking about.
1191748	1193870	That is wrong and very disgusting.
1194410	1195030	Yeah, whatever.
1195351	1195811	And you enjoy it.
1196612	1199674	Uh, big thank you to our buddy SoCalKicks for spending some time with us.
1199794	1200815	Send me proof you get a pen.
1202476	1204197	If you really want a pen now, I can send you a Bic.
1205498	1205878	A Bic?
1206679	1208020	Are you gonna flick your Bic?
1209301	1210162	I'm gonna flick my Bic.
1210242	1211523	Dude, Brad's pen glows.
1214265	1215066	It's a Ravar pen.
1215966	1217948	Ooh, I wanna take E and make out with everybody.
1218568	1221131	Brad, don't you be turning into a slut on me.
1225234	1225814	I said slut.
1226114	1227395	You said it on purpose.
1227436	1227916	Nobody heard it.
1228717	1228977	Alright.
1232463	1242890	So, then also what happened when Loki and I were gone, that Friday is when, here in Orange Lounge World Headquarters in Sacramento, finally, 2DX 8-Style lands here in Sacramento.
1242930	1249215	I know you guys talked about this on the show last week, so I won't go too far into it, but 8-Style's here, it rules, the end.
1250601	1256065	This week, Xtreme started spreading like a bad case of VD all around California.
1257606	1262950	Yes, and it made its way to Stockton last night, so we took a trip down to Stockton Golf Land.
1263230	1266072	As I call it for short, GAG, Ghetto Ass Golf Land.
1267373	1270355	And we went down to GAG to play DDR Xtreme.
1270455	1272476	So, five of us went.
1273557	1276319	The three of us hosts and Angel Straycell went.
1276339	1277199	Are you going to go?
1277259	1277460	Well...
1278320	1281161	What do you want to say about, specifically, what do you want to say about DDR Extreme?
1281261	1284002	Because I know there's lots of people listening going, Extreme!
1285162	1286783	I don't know, I thought that Frozen Ray was neat.
1286843	1290084	Shame on Golfland for getting a bootleg!
1290244	1291245	Bad, bad!
1292085	1293505	They had the most ghetto marquee.
1293766	1301268	They took the DDR, um, the 7th mix sign that was up there, and they put a big sign over that said, Extreme DDR 8th!
1301788	1303349	8th mix, because they're stupid.
1305114	1305854	Stupid people.
1306234	1307475	I wish it said Aderd Mix.
1307495	1308755	I would have paid so much money for it.
1310656	1311396	I'll make one for him.
1311416	1314697	So what are you guys saying?
1314717	1315637	What did you guys think of Max 2?
1315977	1316617	Or, I meant Max 2.
1318738	1319618	Ah, fuck DDR.
1319998	1324880	What did you think of Extreme in comparison to Max 2?
1326280	1327800	It's Max 2 Plus.
1327900	1329061	That's exactly what I thought.
1329121	1330481	It's just DDR Max 2 Plus.
1331221	1332362	Uh, no?
1334386	1344773	Um, let's see, there's a few things, uh, a few things I was disappointed on is the Oni remixes that they had in Max 2 that were supposed to be playable now, they only had one set of steps, and that was the only steps.
1345494	1350237	So, ooh, thanks for going all the way and, uh, giving us, you know, new steps for those.
1351138	1356762	Um, some of the new songs I just didn't really care for, there was a really cool poppin' music one that was like a...
1358945	1359525	You know what?
1359825	1364068	I didn't see, except for you, Rob, no one else played that fucking song.
1364988	1369390	I wanted to do something fucked up my last stage, so I'm like, I'll do the big hot air song.
1369470	1370371	No one played that song.
1370591	1377194	Actually, I was looking at the top three songs for 321 Stars, Vanity Angel, Surprise, and Tears.
1380646	1385787	Those are the only... Now, that was the thing I liked about Xtreme, is that the videos, they keep getting better.
1385827	1389608	The video for Stoic was pretty funny, because it's just like the 2DX one, except it's the Afro guy doing it.
1390208	1394149	And, um... So the video... What were some other songs I actually played?
1394449	1400250	I did the I Do, I Do, I Do, and it had this whole little, like, retro thing going on, with all these little pictures of hot little Asian girls.
1400790	1404191	And, uh... Speed Over Beethoven, I had Beethoven running all around, and all this other stuff.
1404211	1409852	The best video, one of the best videos has to be for Legend of Max, with the guys running in the background and shit like that.
1410112	1410552	That was awesome.
1410612	1411573	Oh my god, Slytherin Max!
1412053	1413574	No, I liked the one for Jet World.
1414075	1414755	That was cool.
1415015	1417858	I wish they had the singing ladies with the humongous heads.
1421320	1422261	That was beautiful, Jamie.
1423822	1424363	That was us.
1424923	1426805	Talk about an encore.
1427585	1428546	Personally, in my opinion...
1429595	1431276	Extreme was just, yeah.
1432996	1433716	Yeah, that too.
1434436	1436057	It just, it's with more shit.
1437237	1439918	I just, it's hard for me to get excited about Extreme.
1439938	1442738	There's nothing that exciting in it.
1443098	1445399	Ooh, somebody's making this room a disco over here with the lights.
1447019	1448000	Uh, how about 8th style?
1448040	1448540	Yeah, woohoo!
1450066	1451067	Yeah, 8-Style's much cooler.
1451808	1452148	Yeah.
1452989	1460317	I wish, though, I remember way back when there was a joke picture that someone had made a giant 2D X-Pad to play with their feet.
1462379	1463460	They should do one of those.
1465038	1467982	To hell with all you and your stupid 2DX!
1468022	1469223	2DX sucks ass!
1469564	1471065	All of you suck ass!
1471946	1475591	Thank you, shut up.
1478173	1480596	All I know about Xtreme is it's just a green Max 2.
1481963	1487625	Yeah, it's a green max, too, with twice as many songs, with more modes, and more options, and more difficulty.
1487845	1489225	Yeah, it's just the same damn game.
1489405	1492306	Hey, it's actually the first mission with 230 songs in it.
1492346	1493206	Yeah, woohoo!
1493567	1494127	Same game!
1494267	1495527	They'll all get played out.
1495627	1498008	Watch us call it Beatmania, because that's what it really is.
1498068	1499268	It's just Beatmania, right?
1499328	1500429	No, it's Beatmania.
1500809	1501649	It's Beatmania.
1502249	1503690	I don't know, it looks like Street Fighter.
1503730	1507631	You know, it's got pixels, it's on a monitor, you push buttons, it's all the same.
1507751	1510772	You know, now granted, I haven't played Extreme yet, but...
1511372	1520159	How come everyone got all excited to go from third mix to fourth mix and all it was was just added songs and stuff?
1520199	1521320	They changed a few things here and there.
1521880	1527104	But when it goes from max to extreme, everyone's just like, we're jaded.
1527565	1528225	Yeah, maybe that's it.
1528425	1528705	I don't know.
1528886	1531568	That's because we didn't like the CD banners.
1532768	1533889	No one liked the discard.
1534109	1534850	No one really cared.
1535611	1536631	Here's a solution.
1536671	1537252	Play Pump It Up.
1537932	1538552	You know what I like?
1538592	1539013	Pick it up.
1540433	1543975	What I did like is that they had the song list.
1544115	1546636	You could divide it by game that it came from.
1547317	1548337	Yeah, see, I know.
1548357	1553039	I mean, like, see, I hear that Extreme has a few new options too and stuff, but I don't know.
1553099	1561103	Like, it seems like everyone got all excited from, you know, transition from third to fourth, but not from, you know, seventh to eighth or, you know, I don't know.
1561463	1561884	Anyway, yeah.
1563064	1569268	I mean, it's okay just to have, like, new stuff to kind of break the monotony of Max 2, because I can only stand to hear the whistle song so many times, you know?
1569468	1570709	It's gone.
1570769	1571550	And it's gone.
1571930	1574332	Well, it might be an unlock, but it's good.
1574352	1574692	Whatever.
1575612	1575893	Whatever.
1577353	1579375	It's kind of nice just to have some new songs kind of mixed up a little.
1579395	1583177	And like I said, the videos are nice, so it's pretty to watch, but... I didn't see Ghosts come back.
1584258	1585039	No, Ghosts did not come back.
1585059	1585459	I didn't see either.
1585479	1586680	That pisses me the fuck off.
1587260	1588461	Because I liked playing Ghosts.
1590062	1591102	Telephone Operator did come back.
1591122	1591703	That was pretty cool.
1593963	1597889	And I saw somebody there playing Freckles just so they could get extra stage.
1598510	1599552	I'm like, Jesus.
1600053	1606403	Okay, you're playing it to get an extra stage, yet you're wasting a stage to get that extra stage.
1606463	1607044	What's up with that?
1608140	1609881	Well, then, fuck that!
1610102	1612623	It's kind of weird, though, because it's now the extra stage.
1612643	1613964	You can pick any song you want.
1613984	1619228	It's just on reverse 1-5 with, um... Butterfly extra stage.
1619609	1620369	That is pretty cool.
1620649	1623912	And heavy, but, um... Let's see.
1624812	1628415	I'd have to say that, uh... Paranoia Survivor, that was hard.
1628615	1629156	That was fun.
1629336	1630857	I only got about halfway through on doubles.
1631157	1633899	I owned A on the Oni, um...
1635080	1638601	Yeah, you double A'd A on Heavy on singles the first time.
1638881	1645783	I passed A on the Oni steps, which are Kata on doubles, and that was fun.
1646723	1649604	And Trip Machine, Survivors, Easy as Hell.
1650504	1652264	It's a weird fucking song.
1652384	1653425	Weird, weird song.
1655105	1656885	What was that one song, Guacamole?
1657966	1658906	Gumland, A Couple.
1658946	1659106	Yeah.
1660720	1664422	That song pissed me off, but I was more pissed off because of the situation.
1664462	1665363	Everything was against me.
1666203	1667944	Yeah, like gag, ghetto-esque offline.
1668164	1668545	What do you say?
1668625	1672407	It had really crazy-ass, what was it, cactus in the background.
1672427	1673228	Yeah, that was pretty cool.
1673248	1675269	The cactus playing Samba was pretty cool.
1676730	1677851	Like I said, the videos are great.
1677951	1679212	The videos keep getting better and better.
1679532	1687397	The best fucking background in a DDR game ever has to be A. A has the most kick-ass background image for it.
1687717	1688377	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
1689737	1691798	Chatroom's asking what about V, V's video.
1691818	1699139	I did see somebody... I really dug the splash screen for V. Yeah, somebody played V. The splash screen was... It's Tron walking down the stairs.
1699159	1700300	It's such a freeze frame of it.
1700580	1702740	With her all shadowed out with the blue light from behind.
1702860	1704501	I don't remember the video itself, though.
1704521	1706501	I think it's just one of those generic rave videos.
1706521	1707541	Generic random shit.
1707581	1708421	That's pretty much it.
1709122	1710422	So there wasn't any special video for that.
1710482	1712082	I think A didn't have a special video either.
1712102	1715463	If I remember right, it just had the V. It just had some random stuff, yeah.
1716363	1718205	Alright, so that's all of our thoughts on Xtreme.
1718225	1718665	Anything else?
1719205	1720246	Angel, you're so quiet over there.
1720266	1721487	Do you have anything you want to say about Xtreme?
1723589	1723729	No.
1723749	1724710	She says no.
1726792	1727953	We're eating death cookies.
1729114	1730034	Okay, okay.
1730255	1731996	They had, they had, um, what was it?
1732477	1734058	They had this really... Murder never tasted better.
1735345	1747727	They had this really cool Japanese heavy metal song that was in there, and it had a really twisted, it had this character from Poppy Music in the background, dressed up like a samurai, and he looked really evil looking, so that was kind of cool, they had that in there.
1748168	1754249	And it was, it was, not, it was a really awesome, it was a really awesome heavy metal song, though.
1755669	1760070	The guy that was playing it was really cool at freestyling, too, so that was kind of cool to watch.
1761949	1764550	Alright, so I think at this point in the show we're going to take a quick break.
1764650	1765111	Sound good to you?
1765651	1766951	Anything else you want to say on Extreme, Jamie?
1766991	1767492	Marzipita!
1768112	1772514	Yeah, we gotta go get... Um, it was extremely, um, yeah.
1773519	1774799	No, I wouldn't say it's a waste.
1774859	1776760	I wouldn't by any means say it's a waste.
1776800	1778581	It's a badly needed upgrade to Max 2.
1779781	1782662	But it doesn't bring anything new into DDR.
1782762	1784502	That's so completely average.
1785863	1788844	They didn't put any of the cooler songs from 2DX in.
1788924	1789944	That kind of pisses me off.
1790684	1791085	Yeah.
1792005	1792425	Some of them.
1792685	1796666	A is kind of fun to dance to, but I mean, it's just, the steps were a little easy.
1796686	1797887	Although I hear the Oni ones are harder.
1797927	1799807	I only played two games, so.
1799907	1801928	But now I have a decent selection of tax songs.
1802554	1803615	They should have put in Cracker.
1804376	1804776	Yes!
1805076	1805396	Yes!
1805717	1806377	No, no, no, no, no.
1806417	1814044	Tears, Sucked Ass, Hyper Eurobeat, I wasn't touching that with a 10-foot pole, and Vandy Angel with double steps, Suck Ass.
1815385	1817106	That's pretty much it, yeah.
1817146	1819188	Speed over Beethoven wasn't as fun as people said it was.
1819208	1820029	Lots of tack.
1820769	1821390	Yeah, tack's cool.
1821890	1822631	Stoke was pretty cool.
1823191	1828496	Some, uh, one of the songs was Naomi and, I forget who else featured in that one.
1829216	1829957	Politeary, I think.
1833030	1834811	Oh, I hate that slut.
1835011	1837732	When was this show ever funny?
1837752	1839613	God, I hope they never bring that song back.
1839673	1842935	That's my least favorite TDR song.
1855441	1856602	It has no musical quality.
1856682	1858603	Okay, we're going to take a quick break.
1859263	1862465	The show was funny when we mentioned Miss Muffet getting AIDS.
1866707	1867487	We're going to come back.
1867647	1869268	I thought that your hooker story was pretty funny.
1870929	1873310	We're going to come back and do the FUs of the week.
1874270	1875991	So send those to me over in the chat room.
1876031	1877972	And dear God, we've got a lot of people to get through tonight.
1878052	1879713	So make them short.
1880133	1884976	All right, we'll be back after a quick break featuring those two little letters you all love.
1888510	1889970	Thank you for watching!
1923582	1924683	Thanks for watching!
2001956	2002438	And now...
2085108	2085851	Thanks for watching!
2112600	2113541	Thanks for watching!

2251011	2251271	Hello?
2251331	2252012	Is this thing on?
2252072	2252592	Testing.
2253773	2254354	Testing 1-2.
2255195	2259158	I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.
2259258	2259719	Hello?
2260399	2261860	I don't understand this.
2262401	2263242	Does this thing work?
2263262	2264863	This thing reads like stereo instructions.
2264923	2265504	Is this on?
2265524	2266144	What the hell?
2268686	2270108	Orange Lounge Radio.
2270288	2272430	Broke down Ghetto Bomani Radio.
2272450	2272670	What the?
2275856	2278017	Yes, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
2278097	2279917	By the way, the beep was really fuck.
2282458	2282898	Thank you.
2282978	2283898	Thank you for sharing that.
2284458	2284778	All right.
2285518	2287579	We are back, and we're going to get right into it.
2287619	2288499	The FUs of the week.
2288539	2291220	Now, we have a lot of new... It's a new year, new people listening to the show.

2302993	2306034	That's getting added to the list, man!
2306955	2309496	Didn't you see everybody eating pizza in front of you?
2311457	2312497	Blind much?
2312537	2314878	Jamie's sitting here going, I love pizza.
2315599	2318260	Trista's got pizza sitting in his freaking hand.
2318320	2319080	Is the pizza here yet?
2321521	2322321	Oh my god.
2322381	2325243	I thought they were supposed to deliver the pizza five minutes ago.
2325743	2326763	Poor Loki.
2326823	2327664	Everybody tease Loki.
2328324	2329464	What are we paying this guy for?
2329484	2330665	We're not.
2332130	2332911	He gives good handjobs.
2332971	2333511	No, I'm just kidding.
2333531	2333752	I'm kidding.
2333772	2334192	I'm kidding.
2334232	2334833	God, I'm kidding.
2336094	2338516	Oh, somebody said the S word.
2344242	2348546	All right, all right, all right.
2348947	2350769	Talk about the FUs of the week, please.
2351229	2351930	Pretty please, Jamie.
2351950	2352570	Tell us all about it.
2352590	2354833	Fuck, fuck, fuck, good luck, screw it, kangaroo.
2354853	2355954	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
2357999	2359239	It's going to be one of those shows.
2359299	2360380	It is one of those shows.
2361120	2362880	I don't know.
2362900	2370482	The hot kids of the week are when we get pissy and say, fuck you.
2372362	2372482	Why?
2372502	2375243	See, Rob likes to censor it and go, F, not me.
2376003	2377823	I don't care about watching my fucking language.
2378803	2379523	So, fuck.
2381224	2387145	Okay, if the two minutes off my life thing were true for everything, I would be burning in hell right now.
2388737	2390578	But remember, I have to take over hell.
2391379	2391659	Ah, yes.
2392540	2393741	Alright, so we're ready to do these FUs of the week.
2393761	2394802	My cootie-tory of hell.
2395302	2396843	Did you say your cootie-tory of hell?
2397604	2399585	People who watch Udoni Kenshin would get it.
2399625	2400065	Oh, okay.
2400686	2401406	Alright, here we go.
2401486	2405590	The FUs of the week, starting off with the FU goddess that we always start off with.
2405970	2406310	Fuck!
2406330	2407231	Say it, Rob.
2407551	2407911	Say it.
2408211	2411574	It's the fuck, shit, cock, whore, piss, cunt FUs of the week.
2412635	2413495	Start saving.
2414296	2414756	Thank you.
2414816	2418119	Um, my first fuck you of the week goes to my shoes.
2420163	2421965	People who have seen me know about my burning feet.
2422965	2424707	I have the coolest pair of shoes in the universe.
2424727	2425848	You might want to see a doctor about that.
2426208	2427129	Bite my ass.
2428010	2428550	Okay.
2429751	2435476	I bought these shoes two and a half months ago from the Vans outlet, and the last pair of shoes I got from the Vans outlet lasted me a year and a half.
2436460	2438181	These are starting to really kill my feet.
2438201	2443603	Before I got my pair of shoes before these, I was having really bad problems with the arches in the old shoes.
2444063	2448425	I couldn't play DDR without having my arches hurt and having my feet just be really painful.
2448985	2453527	Well, these shoes are starting to do it to me, and I've only had two and a half months that I've been wearing them.
2454748	2456208	So, fuck my burning feet.
2458049	2458749	Bill might like it.
2459910	2460590	Shut up, Rob.
2462531	2463031	Next thing.
2464008	2465209	Fuck Stockton, Golfland.
2465249	2466269	Fuck them right in their ear.
2467070	2470551	Because they have those fans mounted on top of the machine.
2471312	2473113	And fans are nice and good and everything.
2473453	2476634	If it's not blowing in your eyes while you're trying to play a song for the first time.
2477195	2481137	I swear, when we were trying to play Guacamole Day Couple... Oh, what was it?
2481657	2482577	Gamelan Day Couple.
2482597	2482818	Gamelan.
2482858	2483698	Why did I say Guacamole?
2483718	2484478	The Mambo song.
2484498	2486239	Just say the goddamn Mambo song.
2486920	2487600	Guacamole.
2489501	2491282	Anyway, um... I, uh...
2492644	2497446	The wind, it was blowing, like, dust in my eyes, and it was, like, tearing up the whole time, so I couldn't even see the play.
2497466	2498766	On top of that, my feet were hurting.
2498866	2499386	Goddamn shoes.
2500026	2504448	And then, like, the insoles in my shoes are peeling up, so it, like, rubs into the ball on my feet.
2504468	2505228	Goddamn ball.
2505688	2506028	Anyway.
2506768	2511550	And then, and then, fuck, um, fuck not getting enough sleep, because I have to do laundry.
2511570	2512450	Fuck all of my clothes.
2513411	2514251	Because... All of them?
2514411	2516251	I cleaned, I cleaned my room.
2517552	2519052	You got about 20 hours?
2519873	2520673	I cleaned my room.
2521932	2523653	I have done two loads of wash.
2524333	2526354	I have about maybe ten more to go.
2527194	2528794	I didn't realize my wardrobe was so huge.
2530975	2533396	Um, the other thing, fuck my new pair of jeans.
2534136	2538278	Because, um, they were falsely made and now I can't return them because I've already won them.
2538878	2539298	In the rain.
2540359	2541199	Um, fuck the rain.
2542059	2542719	Because it's not.
2543880	2546581	And, um, fuck your Yankee blue jeans.
2548221	2548581	Bravo.
2548761	2549082	Thank you.
2549602	2549922	Is that it?
2549942	2550022	Cool.
2551081	2555545	I thought you said that your list of priorities put food above strippers.
2579685	2580006	It did.
2580727	2581928	Well, my food's almost gone, see?
2582549	2584332	So, anyway.
2585434	2589760	Um, there's a really huge FU, and that goes to Drivers, again.
2590841	2591322	Akine...
2592731	2593691	I'm gonna kill you.
2593972	2595572	YOU FREAKING DIDN'T HEAR ME!
2596313	2596853	Seriously!
2597513	2598614	Stop trying to cut me off.
2598914	2603096	If you're stupid as an old Asian bitch, stop changing lanes for no apparent reason.
2603816	2605717	I don't give a shit if you don't know where you're going!
2606157	2607058	Don't get in my way!
2607898	2609999	F'ing stupid driver's ed, people!
2610159	2614001	You're driving 40 miles under the speed limit, and you piss me off!
2614141	2617943	I don't care if you don't know how to drive, because you're never gonna learn how to drive C.A.
2618803	2619144	Okay?
2620704	2621105	Also,
2622325	2623726	FU to freaking Golflands.
2624086	2624786	They suck ass.
2624946	2627527	Okay, Stockton Golflands, alright, but the carpet sucks shit.
2628228	2633050	Um, Roseville Golflands, hello, you kinda have to have drumsticks to play Drum Mania.
2634050	2635331	That's kinda the point of the game.
2635851	2639353	You just, you know, bang the sticks against the drums.
2639513	2640293	That's how it works.
2641574	2643335	Um, also... It's Mambo Go Go now, didn't you hear?
2643935	2645375	Oh, they upgraded.
2645496	2645856	Woo!
2647296	2650778	And, FU to DDR Extreme, for one reason...
2652222	2653362	La Copa de Vida.
2655183	2655603	Know what?
2655623	2658524	You put a Ricky Martin cover in any fucking DDR mix.
2659505	2659925	That's it.
2660425	2660845	For now.
2661665	2662806	I worked for Samba de Amigo.
2662826	2666827	I don't fucking care.
2669008	2672989	Matt has a mouth full of... Anyway, going back to Jamie.
2673049	2674070	Jamie's had a relapse.
2674350	2674650	Yes.
2675290	2676711	Back to the Golfland thing.
2677211	2678651	Fuck those idiots last night.
2678731	2680752	I had your asses kicked out and that was cool.
2682546	2682886	All right.
2683807	2684268	My turn.
2684928	2685389	Are you sure?
2685589	2685749	Yes.
2686330	2687111	My FU of the week.
2687331	2689573	I would additionally like to give an FU of the week to drivers.
2690034	2690434	Yeah, fuck you.
2690554	2698922	If you were driving on I-5 North about last Sunday night, about, oh, I don't know, any time between noon and nine, because that's how long we were on the goddamn road.
2698942	2701185	If you were driving on that road, fuck you.
2701325	2701885	I hate you.
2702026	2705009	Burn in hell for all eternity because you don't know how to fucking drive.
2706064	2706964	My pen is pretty good.
2724147	2724507	That's it.
2724567	2726048	That's all the FUs I can think of right now.
2726288	2729069	So, fuck Stockton Golf Line for being ghetto.
2729349	2731730	Oh, fuck people that don't know how to follow a token line.
2731790	2732731	Fuck the token line.
2732931	2734312	Just fuck the token line altogether.
2734552	2741835	I can't fucking stay on the token line because nobody ever knows how to follow the token line because nobody is smart that plays DDR, apparently.
2741915	2745977	Listen, crazy bitch, you don't fucking put 12 tokens on the goddamn line.
2746457	2748018	One at a time, you dumbass.
2748818	2749879	I'm gonna be playing a lot!
2750019	2754641	I give a fuck that bitch who puts 12 tokens on the machine and you say, you're only supposed to put one up.
2754862	2756122	Oh, I'm gonna be playing a lot.
2756763	2757283	Fuck you!
2758664	2762906	You're gonna be playing none at all when I have my foot so far up your fucking ass you won't be able to walk straight for a week.
2766548	2768930	No, you shoved the foot so far up her ass that she tastes rubber.
2772836	2777722	Anyway, um, yeah, so fuck the token line, because nobody knows how to follow it.
2778023	2779124	Try a sign-up sheet.
2779244	2780806	It takes a pen and a piece of paper.
2781367	2781768	And, um...
2784257	2786278	And if you steal a pen, you're fucking sad.
2786298	2790881	If you have to steal a goddamn 50 cent big pen, your life is really fucking sad.
2791161	2791962	And I hope you die.
2791982	2793182	I hope you die of syphilis.
2793302	2796905	And F you to that stupid flamboyant retard who's playing Pair of Pair.
2797105	2802008	I understand that Pair of Pair is a game for women, but fucking... Seriously, you're way too... Oh, yes!
2802268	2804710	And F you to people who play Bamadi games that look gayer than me.
2804950	2806111	Nobody is gayer than me!
2806731	2807151	Nobody!
2809233	2810994	That was just... It was just so weird...
2814309	2822276	It, it, it's just, but this guy was more flamboyant than, oh my god, Liberace, this guy was more flamboyant than fucking Elton John.
2825418	2831924	He must have been the most flamboyant person on the known, he scares me, scares me.
2832624	2834646	I have video of it though, it will be going up on my website.
2834666	2836387	Yeah, we're gonna be making flamingpara.com.
2839730	2840011	I'm done.
2841053	2842256	I got really ranty this week.
2842276	2843117	That was amazing.
2843137	2844420	Jamie, I see why Jamie likes this.
2845883	2846545	No, I fear.
2847146	2847827	With the PH3 PR.
2849870	2852392	and FU to Dave and Buster for overcharging on their games.
2853313	2853773	That sucked.
2854114	2860199	Yeah, F Miss Thang, my horse in Derby Owners Club, my horse named Miss Thang, for coming in last place in every single race.
2860219	2861160	You suck, I hate you.
2861180	2861720	Turn in the glue.
2861760	2867305	And FU to the owner of Cloud, the fucking horse that beat both of ours because you're a stupid little girl and you think you know better.
2867625	2869487	So, ha, I jacked your fucking horse.
2869667	2870508	How do you say about that?
2870528	2870708	Huh?
2870728	2872869	You don't have your horse anymore because I have it.
2872910	2873450	Woo!
2875031	2875332	All right.
2875572	2876553	My music again, please.
2876753	2877193	Okay.
2878720	2886449	Fuck my Trueno in Initial D. I love the car to death, but it has no acceleration, so I made a new car.
2886669	2888932	I have an Integra Type R now, and it's the same as Magic.
2889652	2889973	That's all.
2890632	2891392	Okay, I have another rant.
2892293	2894574	With the exception of Jamie, fuck Initial D players.
2895014	2896834	You all drive the same goddamn car.
2896974	2902817	I saw seven of you coming out of the Golf Land parking lot, all with cheap-ass plastic spoilers on your little rice rockets.
2902837	2903217	No, no, no, no.
2903677	2904657	The erector set spoiler, too.
2904677	2906018	Yes, the erector set spoiler.
2906338	2907558	God, you people are sad.
2907738	2909179	Initial D is not real life.
2911160	2913841	Remember, folks, you're driving a Civic, not a race car.
2914081	2914601	God.
2915101	2916842	Stickers do not make it go faster.
2919005	2923189	Oh, I put the Type R sticker on my Toyota.
2924670	2926772	Excuse me, there's no Toyota car.
2926812	2928874	Your car is sad and so are you.
2928914	2930135	You can't drift on Highway 80.
2930535	2931096	Get over it.
2933559	2941544	Oh, that doesn't stop me from getting my actual Corolla, 86 Corolla hatchback to modify into the Torino Sprinter with Amanda Payne.
2943486	2944006	No, I'm just kidding.
2944146	2944866	Jamie's cool like that.
2944886	2945147	She's okay.
2945167	2945947	She's the exception to the rule.
2945967	2949850	The whole reason I would have a Ricey car is because I think they're funny.
2950970	2953012	Jamie can appreciate the comic value of a funny car.
2953032	2953852	I think they're funny.
2953912	2959236	I want to get, like, an 85 Mustang GT and, like, Ricey.
2962498	2966981	and F you to the stupid bitch at Rayleigh's, the Chinese food takeout place.
2967361	2968962	Listen, bitch, I don't want a sample.
2969082	2970443	I didn't want a sample before.
2970763	2972985	Stop trying to give me a fucking sample after I get my food.
2973245	2976187	Obviously, I want what I'm getting and not what you're offering.
2976547	2980230	Stop trying to offer me the fucking sample, stupid Chinese bitch.
2982171	2982451	I'm done.
2983959	2986000	Wow, Loki's PMSing.
2987040	2987401	Okay.
2988241	2988981	Oh, back to the FUs.
2989001	2989902	Let's go around the room.
2990082	2991303	Are we done with your FUs, Jamie?
2991343	2991783	I guess so.
2991803	2992163	Yes, okay.
2992763	2993323	Give me money.
2993964	2994104	No.
2994404	2995725	Fuck everyone who doesn't give me a dollar.
2996585	2996845	All right.
2997225	2997666	Here we go.
2997746	2998446	Going around the room.
3000595	3002417	This is the song I chose for all of your FUs.
3003137	3003498	Enjoy it.
3004538	3005359	We'll start with Stressa.
3005840	3006020	What?
3006040	3008081	Oh, sorry, he sent me a track.
3008101	3008782	Jesus Christ.
3009343	3009903	I gotta find it.
3009923	3011204	Then go to Angel.
3011284	3013386	Her and Magus wanted this song, right?
3013866	3014447	We want this song.
3016929	3017670	You want Butterfly?
3018691	3020612	Listen, bitches, you're gonna take what I give you.
3020652	3021313	Now do your FUs.
3022594	3024456	First of all, FU to our theme music.
3024496	3025416	We want Stoic.
3026798	3026878	Ugh.
3029139	3029939	Oh man, Jamie said so.
3034822	3035662	Magus, FUs.
3039023	3042045	First of all, FU to Butterfly Upswing Mix.
3042525	3046087	I pick it by accident, then I accidentally put it on Maniac.
3046447	3046987	What the hell?
3047087	3048508	I wasn't in the mood for a Kata.
3051409	3052910	I got four Katas on my belt.
3053750	3055951	I go for... I accidentally put on a Kata.
3057373	3059955	Auto-fail within, I don't know, 30 seconds?
3061777	3065259	Waste my entire load.
3065279	3066320	50 seconds, okay?
3067201	3069042	It's an 8.
3071864	3072485	But still!
3073325	3073626	Fuck!
3073806	3075707	Butterfly upswing mix, okay?
3075727	3077088	Alrighty.
3084246	3093948	Angel, you got any FUs of the week?
3095169	3096269	I had one, but he took it.
3096569	3097669	You want me to go with somebody else to come back?
3097969	3098269	Yeah, sure.
3098429	3099089	All right, stress out.
3099309	3100190	Give me your FUs of the week.
3101250	3105671	Wow, interesting list for me today, which kind of goes against the usual.
3106611	3110752	First and foremost, the parents still need a serious, well...
3112256	3115737	I'll let you fill it in however you like.
3115997	3117037	Okay, boo-boo, perfect.
3118077	3120438	Um, my mom is still pissing me off to no end.
3121098	3125499	My dad, well, he still needs a lesson in pulling his head out of his ass, but that's a side issue.
3126219	3130120	Um, I want to send out an FU to my ex.
3132080	3134141	Jeez, she's totally pissing me off like this.
3135141	3138442	She sent me this Dear John-like email and hasn't said a word to me since.
3138482	3139942	Well, what the hell, uh...
3142052	3151639	Um, next on the list, fuck life, and the general ideals that some people just don't understand.
3153300	3156522	You know, they've got all their ideals and their fucking shit.
3157322	3158563	They don't like giving people things.
3159204	3159684	Hell not.
3160525	3161125	Well, you know what?
3162446	3163887	Big steel dildo for you.
3164767	3165468	Right up the ass.
3167409	3167729	Got that.
3167749	3169891	That's the impression he and I didn't want to think of.
3171027	3177196	Anyways, I think I'm about done.
3181062	3183225	Alright, allergies must die.
3184126	3184827	We ready for Angel?
3185969	3186450	Did you remember?
3190703	3192764	Alright, go to Loki, because he thought of another one.
3194005	3196827	Um, this is just a really short one, unlike the other ones.
3196847	3202290	F you to the Ralphs that we went to last night, because they were out of three important things.
3202871	3204632	One, large boxes of bagel bites.
3204932	3207714	Two, Maxim Magazine, and three, PSM.
3208694	3212396	All the things I wanted from the Ralphs, and they didn't have, so F you to the Ralphs.
3212757	3213057	That's it.
3213922	3215485	But in favor of the Rivals, they have Spumoni.
3215966	3216807	They do have Spumoni.
3217388	3218170	And chocolate whipped cream.
3218410	3218650	Yes.
3218851	3219452	Ready whipped.
3219512	3220814	Chocolate ready whipped.
3220834	3221535	Chocolate with it.
3222758	3224461	Alright, I'm going to run through the chatroom FUs.
3224481	3225923	We'll come back to Angel if she thinks they're hers.
3226344	3226584	Okay.
3228530	3230452	On with the chatroom FUs.
3230692	3233494	FU to having to come home on my birthday and missing Orange Lounge that day.
3234195	3236236	Well, that's okay because we do rebroadcast every Monday night.
3236657	3241901	And supposedly, I heard a rumor we do them on Thursday afternoons too when it actually works, but it hasn't for like the past month.
3241981	3244843	So it's always been like 15 minutes late or some shit.
3244883	3248386	So Thursdays at 2 we try to do them, but Mondays at 7 it always happens.
3248466	3250548	So you can always catch up on Orange Lounge that way.
3251806	3258967	Blackwab, fuck power outages, one messed up on my clocks last night, fuck my video card, I can play online games at the best pings but the shittiest frame rates.
3259347	3260768	Loki, you better keep your mouth shut on that.
3261228	3264388	Fuck the timing belt in my car, it needs to be replaced and will cost near $800.
3264528	3266489	That kept me from rearing my car up to Davis' quarter.
3266789	3268309	Oh yeah, and fuck the city of Davis too.
3268449	3271909	Fuck the owner at TAPEX that refuses... and it got cut off.
3272550	3273030	Silly Mac.
3273570	3276470	I'm guessing he refuses to turn up Macs or something like that.
3277050	3280391	And, uh, yeah, he's reminding me I need to make an announcement, which I will do.
3281412	3294483	And, um... Okay... Nostylan says, uh... I want to say my fuck you of the week is or to script it sucks and doesn't work like it's supposed to dot dot.
3295183	3296504	Typical Nostylan English there.
3296564	3298886	That was beautiful.
3298907	3300368	StaplerX keeps it simple.
3300408	3301589	A big F you to Garbage Day.
3301789	3302810	Hey man, Garbage Day sucked.
3305532	3306333	You need a pushpin?
3307334	3307414	Oh.
3307927	3309208	Yes, I need a pushpin.
3309569	3311070	I don't think I have any pushpins, Jumper.
3311110	3312372	Do you have any After Use of the Week, Jumper?
3313653	3315335	Yeah, people who don't have pushpins.
3316036	3316376	Sorry.
3316917	3317798	There might be some over there.
3317858	3319760	See if there's a pushpin over on Brian's desk.
3321281	3323403	Underneath the Cookies of Doom or in the little jar.
3323443	3325386	See if there's some pushpins over there.
3326847	3327368	I'm sorry.
3328929	3329390	I'm sorry.
3331519	3332339	Wait, he said garbage.
3333459	3334780	I don't count people saying it in chatroom.
3334800	3335580	I don't count people saying it.
3336380	3338480	I don't count it when people say slut in the chatroom.
3343141	3343761	Joke's on already.
3343781	3349282	Anyway, SoCalKick says, Fuck nothing because I just spent an awesome 27 hours with my best friend, Owen.
3349762	3354063	And also, fuck school tomorrow even though I'd rather be at school than being lazy doing nothing at home.
3355003	3356124	Fuck people who are happy.
3356624	3357404	He didn't say that, I did.
3361189	3363670	Slinky, fuck school and trends.
3364651	3366872	Fuck school really badly for having to go back tomorrow.
3370094	3372235	EOSFEB says, fuck you too.
3372996	3373776	Shit, nothing.
3373976	3376838	Just to say fuck you, I just wanted to say slut.
3376918	3378119	Slut, slut, slut, slut.
3384122	3384963	Yeah, right, yeah.
3386721	3415161	Vidpala, F you to school, because after a break I don't want to go back F you to Fox for delaying 24 for 3 weeks Hey man, fuck Fox F you to people who don't like the song Bag, because I love that song And uh, Sluts I hate our chatroom, I hate them so much No, I'm just kidding, I love you guys Muheimer I'm not saying that first word And I have to check the mailbag, because his FUs are there
3416135	3418797	JB says, F you to doing two projects at the last minute.
3418817	3420298	Well, whose fault is that, Mr. Man?
3421559	3421860	Alright.
3423281	3424802	Those are all the lovely F yous of the week.
3427364	3430046	Oh, Jamie got another one.
3430086	3431807	I hope it's not about my bathroom.
3433188	3434770	I say fuck you to cheese, thank you.
3435590	3435911	Okay.
3437412	3438733	Angel, did she get yours?
3439313	3440034	Oh, yes she did.
3440094	3440634	Okay, here we go.
3441295	3444417	I thought someone... Fuck...
3449141	3460207	Fuck coworkers who forget to come in at the time that they are scheduled because she thought she was supposed to come in at 4 and she was scheduled for 1.30 and I was supposed to leave at 2.
3460387	3461427	Fuck you!
3463568	3465889	Yes, and fuck my boss for trying to kill me with pepper.
3467430	3468371	Tried to kill you with pepper?
3468411	3469211	How is that possible?
3470512	3475374	She was making sandwiches and I was bending down to get the tomatoes out of the cooler and...
3476155	3478601	Yeah, um, Pepper got in my nose.
3478882	3479824	You bastard.
3483191	3484494	Does Brad have any FUs of the week?
3488491	3489171	Can I give him tack?
3489191	3490252	Because that's about all I got left.
3490352	3491012	I'll give him Alien World.
3492412	3492732	What is it?
3493312	3493693	Alien World.
3493973	3494933	Oh, sweet, thank you.
3495333	3497174	Okay, not really, it's kind of a kind FU.
3497394	3502555	FU to Keith for making us run away from Golfland, though we love him for it, because Scandia kicks ass.
3502935	3503835	Yay!
3504956	3505536	That's not an FU.
3505556	3507797	I propose a group fuck you to Roosevelt Golfland.
3508417	3510717	I don't want to fuck them, they have AIDS.
3514578	3514878	All right.
3515400	3516644	Those are the lovely FUs of the week.
3516684	3519733	They suck because they broke Speed Demon and wouldn't fix it.
3519773	3520575	Those bastards.
3522225	3523466	Everything else is broken there.
3523506	3523966	Why not?
3524086	3527729	Slinky says F you to people who jam 7 quarters and break the coin slot for max 2.
3527769	3528489	That does suck.
3529590	3531651	That's like the girl putting in her 12 tokens all at once.
3533373	3534473	They go stupid.
3535054	3537295	F you to Skrull.
3537735	3538856	We don't want to go back.
3539156	3540878	We will never want to go back.
3541138	3542238	It's Christmas vacation.
3543079	3543960	I don't have to go to school.
3544280	3545200	I don't have to go to school either.
3547702	3552064	I have to go to work, though.
3553445	3555085	At least I'm not one of those corporate whore types.
3556186	3557727	Hey, I can surf the internet at work.
3558407	3558887	Me too.
3559307	3562449	Daniel with 500 megs worth of sim files every day.
3564510	3565370	Oh, I got a late one.
3565530	3566151	I got a late one.
3566211	3568652	It's from a new person in our chat room, so say hello to the new person.
3568672	3569472	Better come late than never.
3571013	3573314	This new person was asking about DDR in Auburn, by the way.
3573334	3574715	Where the hell is their machine up there, Brad?
3574755	3575215	Second mix.
3575895	3579257	Okay, they used to have a third mix at some Pizza Express.
3579437	3580317	It's not there, I hear.
3580637	3581898	But there is a second mix.
3582118	3584039	Probably the only one in all of... I want to play!
3584779	3588220	It's in the Signature Theaters, and the volume is all the way down.
3588360	3590181	So try playing a Beatmania with no sound.
3590221	3590801	It's pretty fun.
3591842	3596704	Anyway, Tadpole says, I want to say fuck you to my grandma for making me turn the volume down so low I can't hardly hear anything.
3597024	3599085	Fuck you to Pizza Express for not having DDR anymore.
3600005	3602947	And a great big fuck you to gas stations for gas being so damn expensive.
3603107	3603227	Yeah.
3604847	3605367	Fuck games!
3605387	3605887	No, I don't try.
3615011	3615571	TREATMAG!
3615591	3616171	TREATMAG!
3616431	3623774	I guess that one about the seven coins and the max, too, was actually from Twen, but I somehow missed it, because... He doesn't count.
3624254	3624694	I don't know.
3625614	3629476	No, I had it on... I thought his thing was for Loki.
3629496	3630536	He said it was a message for Loki.
3630576	3630836	Whatever.
3631036	3631636	Anyway, who cares?
3633097	3633617	Moving on.
3635427	3636547	That's all of our FUs of the week.
3636567	3637448	That was beautiful, wasn't it?
3638028	3639128	Are we going to another?
3639888	3642709	We want to talk more about DDR?
3642789	3645970	Let's talk to our guests that we don't have here on the show very much.
3646150	3646390	Like never.
3646410	3649211	Let's talk to Stress on DDR Angel.
3650931	3651211	Loki.
3651231	3653192	I just want to make a comment.
3654412	3655932	I like that fort.
3656373	3657333	That fort was cool.
3657733	3658333	Yes, yes.
3658473	3661594	I live up in the boondocks up in northern...
3662543	3663543	Well, I'm out there.
3664063	3666684	If you know where Santa Rosa is, you're likely to find me there.
3668424	3669024	The fort is cool.
3669764	3671405	The fort is damn sexy.
3673305	3677706	We don't know if people live there, because we do see smoke every occasionally, but nobody ever really checks it out.
3678966	3679426	Go figure.
3680106	3682726	Could it be those big graffiti signs that say, keep out of the fort?
3684027	3684747	Very well possible.
3685727	3689208	Of course, you know, we should still make that image for Jamie.
3690768	3691688	The Jamie New World Order.
3692307	3693007	Beginning in the Fort.
3693687	3695508	I'll start my own cult, we'll move into a compound.
3696928	3697228	Woot!
3698009	3702070	It's only going after some dark black forest.
3703270	3705891	Well, it actually might be considered a dark black forest.
3706391	3710832	But of course, Jamie will have the interesting opportunity to meet said forest.
3711772	3713213	I'll be the army of stoics.
3714753	3718874	And I will have a dark black forest, because I don't particularly care for that song.
3720215	3720855	It's overplayed.
3722560	3734691	But I want my own compound where I can make people... I want to recruit stupid people in this compound and then make them die face first in a pool of jello.
3735672	3738474	I say we all quit our jobs and move into the fort!
3739255	3740716	Yes, we must move into the fort.
3741277	3742918	Orange Lounge live from the fort next week.
3743599	3743839	Alright.
3745501	3746161	So there's the fort.
3746762	3747803	How are you doing, Angel?
3747823	3748964	We haven't heard much from you this show.
3750842	3752263	Why did you start playing DDR?
3752283	3753323	What got you into DDR?
3753883	3756465	What made you, was it the flashing seizure lights with the music?
3759886	3760786	The truth or other?
3761267	3761487	Other.
3762647	3763768	We never tell the truth in the show.
3765949	3766509	I don't know.
3767089	3769770	Alright, so most of us don't know why we play DDR.
3771511	3772632	I got conned into it.
3772872	3774833	You got conned into it, good, good answer.
3775453	3776813	And then I couldn't stop.
3777274	3778334	And I still haven't stopped.
3779094	3779475	Because...
3782248	3782789	Sorry, stress out.
3783009	3784190	It's an STD all of its own.
3784210	3785370	Yes, it's an STD all of its own.
3785591	3786651	Is DDR a disease?
3787012	3787492	Maybe it is.
3788333	3789093	It's an addiction.
3790354	3791995	It's an addiction and I need help.
3793076	3794858	Unfortunately, they don't have a 12-step program for this yet.
3795398	3797760	And they're not going to, because whoever tries to start one, I'll kill.
3798841	3803504	It's an addiction, like crack, cocaine, and alcohol, and then laundry burger baskets, and things like that.
3803804	3805346	It's an addiction that's good for you.
3806026	3806346	Vanilla crack.
3806366	3807787	It's chock full of... Vanilla crack!
3809249	3809629	Propel.
3810475	3813176	Hi, my name is the 23rd Magus and I'm a Bimani addict.
3816076	3816816	Get me a gun.
3817837	3819757	Isn't this the point where I'm supposed to clap or do something?
3819797	3823598	Isn't the point where someone's supposed to go, Hi, Magus.
3823838	3825678	Hi, Magus.
3825698	3826358	There we go.
3826899	3827699	See, I'm feeling better now.
3828399	3829179	You know what?
3829279	3834700	I think that it's really the space aliens came and invented the Bimani series.
3834760	3835340	It was Zim.
3835581	3837521	No, it was Trans Race.
3838906	3848448	This is the great space co-gal Tran came on her flying saucer with her cat and her snowmobile and decided to make us all bimaniatics.
3848708	3849868	Ooh, the snowblower of doom.
3850488	3851569	You haven't seen the video.
3851949	3853029	Let's show them the video for some time.
3853049	3854729	This is DDR, not the last Starfighter.
3856550	3857270	It is like that.
3857370	3860530	See, they're going to make us into an incredible race of rhythm dancing machines and stuff.
3860751	3864631	And at the last war, at the end of the world, we're all going to have to dance off against the aliens.
3865531	3867052	That would work, except for one thing.
3867112	3867752	We're not Asian.
3870871	3871952	Uh, but I am!
3872573	3875115	Yeah, exactly, see, we- Kill any deaths to the kneecaps!
3875615	3878858	Say, hey, I may be honky with no rhythm, but- STILL BE A DEATH!
3878878	3879398	STILL BE A DEATH!
3880639	3883221	I may be honky with no rhythm, but there are some Asians here who can help.
3883301	3887605	I don't know, if you count maybe about, oh, 150 years back, I could qualify.
3887625	3897033	Uh, late fuck you to pizza for being so damn yummy and good that I eat it all and I get, like, fat in my arteries and I die.
3900663	3901223	ProPublicu.
3901283	3909028	Yeah, anyways, as far as the beginning of my Bomani DDR type addiction, it was because of Angel.
3909569	3914512	It was she who conned me into it, and ever since, I don't quite know what's become of me.
3915453	3917854	Yes, but you have gone from one step to five.
3917874	3919075	All in one day!
3919195	3920136	Have a murder cookie.
3921016	3921957	They're death-errific.
3922877	3923498	Death cookie!
3923558	3925339	Death cookie!
3926880	3929942	For the people who aren't seeing these, we have holiday Oreos.
3930589	3933392	They can't call them Christmas Oreos because it's not politically correct.
3933713	3936195	So they're holiday Oreos with red filling.
3936836	3939659	And they're red like they're stained with blood.
3940420	3941000	Like a tampon.
3943953	3945553	Now they're menstrual cookies!
3947194	3947595	Anyway.
3947955	3950596	We'll call it, we'll call it, we'll call it Mencios.
3951577	3952378	That's disgusting.
3952438	3952678	Anyway.
3953958	3955820	I, I missed, I feel bad.
3955840	3957861	It tastes like, it tastes like a cycle.
3958061	3961043	I feel bad because I forgot to check the mailbag for the FUs of the week.
3961063	3961603	Check it!
3961643	3963544	There was one sitting in there, so I've got to do it.
3963644	3964945	So it's a late FU, sorry.
3965465	3965885	Sorry.
3966166	3967827	You can't always send an email though if you want.
3967847	3970028	No, give them my music because I want to hear more tacks.
3970208	3970849	You wanna hear more TAC?
3970869	3972670	How about the TAC song you wouldn't let me play for anyone else?
3972730	3973010	Okay.
3973430	3973711	Alright.
3975432	3977874	Oh wait, he requested a song for his FU, should I give it to him?
3979715	3982237	Nah, I never let people have their requested songs, so deal.
3984299	3985720	Alright, I'll be nice.
3985860	3986841	Only because we forgot.
3987181	3987421	Okay.
3988782	3989463	Luhimer!
3990447	3998871	Muheimer says, yay for drunk parents and their friends making Drunky the Snowman outside my house on New Year's Eve by decorating him with beer, noisemakers, and a hat.
3999751	4000772	That is a winner.
4000932	4003233	That is the best FU I think I've ever read on this show.
4003273	4005194	There's going to be a bunch of drunk squirrels running around.
4005914	4008456	That was worth going back to the FU segment for right there.
4008556	4009696	Drunky the Snowman.
4012638	4013238	I want to make one.
4015413	4016695	now featured on DDRPC
4030649	4030989	All right.
4032250	4032991	He goes on, though.
4033051	4034272	Maybe it gets even better.
4034612	4039096	And everyone point and laugh to this kid at my swim meet today who friggin' fell off the starting block.
4039416	4041898	I've never seen anything like that in all my years of swimming.
4042299	4044821	Even though if it were me falling off the block, I'd kill myself.
4044881	4045521	Ha-ha at him.
4047643	4048624	Everybody point and laugh.
4050545	4050846	Okay.
4051852	4053953	A dumb little kid who fell off the starting box for me.
4054733	4056814	I think Square is top of Cool Shapin' World.

4397768	4401173	Satellite Control, Zero, Minus One Hour End
4589082	4592684	The following bit of randomness has been brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.
4593024	4594345	Dateline the Muppet Show.
4594745	4599028	It has been reported just moments ago that a large heavy object was dropped from the ceiling.
4599408	4601870	Further developments will... Hey, any balls down there?
4602090	4604531	That's the biggest bear you ever seen, Diggleberry.
4607333	4608694	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
4609414	4609974	And we're back.
4610034	4611035	Hope you enjoyed that little break.
4611115	4612836	Everybody's drooling over Bambi.
4612956	4615898	They're in the chat room because of Spaceman that we played.
4617039	4617599	You're welcome.
4619827	4624008	We were going to do the match game coming back into this segment, except we didn't have enough time to prepare, so we're going to hold that off.
4624028	4625749	We'll do that in about a half hour.
4625769	4626650	We'll come back and do a match game.
4627330	4628270	We'll do a match game in a little while.
4629071	4629471	What's up?
4629851	4630271	So what's up?
4630291	4631832	We don't have anything else to talk about.
4631892	4633593	Do I have to do everything?
4634562	4636623	Oh, yeah, let's hear a sim update before we get to listless.
4636643	4637443	Then we'll do a listless.
4637663	4638244	Let's do a sim update.
4638264	4638744	Sim update.
4639364	4645787	Finally, we can stop playing DDRPC if you haven't done it yet, because they released the last stupid character set.
4646127	4648968	Not that anyone even fucking cares anymore, because I don't.
4649248	4650489	The game sucks ass.
4650949	4654731	But if you care, it's some stupid princess and some prince guy, and I don't care.
4655131	4655671	It's crap.
4656191	4656612	Whatever.
4656812	4657212	Enjoy.
4657712	4659453	So they're there for your enjoyment.
4660351	4662132	Aside from that, Tournament Mix 3 is wrapping up.
4662373	4665034	Tomorrow should have the results.
4665955	4668757	I'd have to say this has been the worst run tournament I've ever seen.
4669517	4671939	And they should all burn in hell for it.
4672159	4673540	And I'm going to do better for it.
4673640	4675721	I'm going to do a better tournament than they will.
4676202	4677243	Because I own them.
4677963	4679784	Speaking of which, how did MakeEditGetPorn go?
4682566	4683407	Well, you know what?
4683467	4686329	Some people just don't understand this concept of deadlines.
4686669	4687289	So you know what?
4687629	4689731	The people sent me edits to GetPorn, the people didn't.
4690572	4691773	Go fuck themselves!
4693014	4694255	You should give me porn anyway.
4696357	4697959	I know, I have plenty of porn to give away.
4697999	4703484	I mean, people don't like porn at my work for some reason, I don't know why, so they just put it in the coffee room and I take it.
4704164	4705285	I think that porn is funny.
4706266	4706887	But, yeah.
4707447	4708248	Porn blows.
4708789	4709089	Get it?
4709469	4709750	Hello?
4709770	4709810	Hi!
4711451	4712932	But yeah, so that's what's going on.
4713552	4724336	As I mentioned slightly earlier, there's going to be a Leech from Loki 2.0 coming up because I got web hosting thanks to DDR Alama from DDR Mania X and Chris Stanford from the Set Mania site.
4724376	4729518	They're giving me web hosting with unlimited space and unlimited bandwidth, so I get to put whatever the fuck I want on there.
4729998	4732919	I guess they're trying to challenge me to crash the boards or something, but...
4733579	4737042	Whatever, so I'm going to put all my sim files on there slowly in theme packs.
4737062	4740265	We're going to do interviews with step file makers and that kind of thing.
4740365	4742567	So that's pretty much what's coming up.
4742627	4747792	Right now I'm just redoing the design of the site because I have to try to figure out how the fuck to sort 2100 step files.
4750234	4750854	That'll be fun.
4752035	4754216	Aside from that, do check out Bimani Style.
4754236	4759720	They're putting up all week long the new DDR Extreme DWIs.
4759820	4764242	In fact, they're the thing for the Legend of Max and Paranoia Survivor samples.
4764342	4768825	So definitely check them out if you haven't yet for sim files and that kind of thing.
4770786	4776370	Really, aside from that, not too much going on other than DDR Extreme coming out and us finding out more about it.
4777430	4780611	Looks like we pretty much, you know, we know what songs are going to be hidden in there.
4780772	4784773	And I have a continued little rant, sort of.
4785173	4794677	Basically, this is a fuck you to everyone that said I was wrong about Sakura Bean and fucking DDR Extreme because I knew I called it a long ass time ago and all of you naysayers can burn in hell!
4798779	4799279	So that's all.
4800380	4800540	Yeah.
4802371	4806535	Okay, I went back over to the mailbag to look at some... Bag.
4806555	4811540	To see if we've got... I hate you.
4812821	4814763	I went to see if we got any mail, and guess what?
4814823	4815183	We do.
4815304	4819387	We have a question from SoCalKicks, of course.
4819888	4822210	It's a question specifically for Loki.
4823732	4826134	Can I have the Robotech Macross Saga DVDs?
4828962	4831924	Well, if I had them to give, then yeah.
4832305	4833606	But I don't, so no.
4834626	4835727	Can I have some more porn?
4835767	4836688	I have titles I like.
4838609	4843953	All I get is the stupid Playboy shit, and so, you know, I pretty much gave you all the, well, some of the new stuff.
4844514	4845654	I guess, yeah.
4846615	4847576	You know, whatever I have.
4847596	4851339	Alright, he says at the end, PayPal may come if two or more of the requests are met.
4851819	4855021	I don't know how two or more is possible, because you only made two requests!
4856742	4858123	You're being edumacated, apparently.
4858143	4858503	You know what?
4858563	4867606	If he just actually came up here to visit us instead, he can come to my house and not only watch all the Robotech stuff, but watch all the Macross stuff, because I happen to have the whole box set.
4867866	4871928	And Final Fuck X, which I got a copy of last night.
4874769	4875970	Yo, HP tastes good.
4875990	4876810	Did it turn out all right?
4877779	4878459	Yeah, it was cool.
4878519	4880440	It's just VCD quality, whatever, you know.
4880900	4883720	It's the same as the other VCDs I have from Japan that are porn.
4883740	4884421	They're censored.
4885541	4886601	Censored porn sucks.
4886701	4888341	It's like made-for-TV porn.
4890002	4892482	Alright, I'm opening up another email here.
4893123	4896163	DarkTetsuya wants to know, when will you put more of an SMA into rotation?
4896203	4897484	I do have a request for one song.
4897524	4898364	I want to hear Red Hot.
4898404	4899004	It's really cool.
4901544	4902245	Oh, wow.
4905289	4910831	All of my MP3s, by the way, because I've had all the Vanessa May stuff, they're gone.
4911331	4912351	Because guess what?
4912431	4913372	My hard drive broke.
4913952	4916192	So you send me RedHot, it'll make it into rotation.
4917053	4918893	Alright, we'll get RedHot into rotation.
4919693	4921334	Damn you, you Vanessa May damn whore.
4921894	4922754	Jamie made a noose.
4923575	4925535	She has a noose on her neck and I have a noose on my neck.
4925555	4926115	That's cute.
4926416	4927156	This is weird.
4929296	4930977	Hey, dual mic penetration.
4934580	4935400	I want my news back.
4938001	4938301	Okay.
4938461	4939921	I'll fix it, Kim.
4940581	4942062	Let's talk about some show news.
4942142	4945162	Things that have happened in the past and coming in the future to the show.
4946263	4946643	Boners.
4947743	4948623	You said coming.
4949723	4950864	You slut.
4951244	4951924	I'm sorry, Jamie.
4951964	4952584	What did you say?
4952604	4953764	I said you're a slut.
4953784	4957025	$5 Saki Saki.
4957125	4959765	I love you all night long if you let me sing for you.
4962785	4964765	I am Australian, but I sound Asian.
4964785	4966526	I thought she was Italian.
4966806	4967406	She's Australian.
4968666	4970066	It's not boring, Australian.
4970186	4972207	How many Australian singers and actors do we need?
4973407	4974647	We have Olivia Newton-John.
4975187	4976187	Olivia Newton-John's cool.
4976787	4977427	She's great.
4977788	4979928	Have you never been mellow?
4979948	4984329	I swear I'm going to make every person in this room watch Xanadu with me one night.
4986269	4986669	I'm sick.
4987349	4991990	Personally, though, from the outside coming in... Your eyes still work.
4992600	4994261	This is... You made me watch Showgirls.
4994861	4995842	I did make her watch Showgirls.
4996002	4997963	That's a good movie.
4998324	4999524	For me to poop on.
5002386	5004027	I never actually thought it would be something like this.
5005168	5008110	But, when you enter this... Whoa, hello!
5009211	5009991	I just got a little show there.
5010011	5011572	When did this studio turn into a gay nightclub?
5011872	5014294	Stop that.
5015094	5016735	He almost gave me a lap dance.
5018797	5020718	The weird part about it is I was still standing.
5024830	5025830	Why don't you just sit on this?
5030392	5031192	And now he's been tied.
5032973	5033773	I'm sorry, you had a thought?
5034073	5037254	No, no, it was coming into this from the outside.
5038174	5039255	Yeah, I said it again.
5039575	5041635	Look who's the dirty slut now!
5043556	5045357	Maybe coming to the outward thing.
5045397	5045677	Uh-oh.
5053311	5055032	Hi, I have news.
5055192	5057693	I wanted to get to Orange Lounge news because this is actually really big news.
5058173	5060735	We've made our first bestest friends on the interweb.
5061715	5064416	And those buddies of ours... I saw your tummy.
5065517	5066777	Woo!
5066897	5067618	I'm blind!
5069039	5073881	Our new bestest friends on the interweb are located at eastofosaka.net.
5076482	5079083	And Jamie had to do a lot of that to get this to happen.
5079103	5079804	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
5079844	5079804	37?
5080404	5082125	In a while?
5083194	5085176	Turn it to suck any dick on your way out of the parking lot.
5085436	5086237	Hey, you get back here.
5088419	5088760	All right.
5089180	5092083	Yes, eastofosaka.net, they're our friends, our bestest friends on the net.
5092643	5095366	And they've led us onto their forums.
5095426	5100251	So if you thought the Orange Lounge forums sucked on the little free thing we had, then fine.
5100571	5103875	We've got cool forums now because they're a part of the eastofosaka.net forums.
5103935	5106918	So my avatar owns all of you.
5108843	5112505	I still think mine's cooler, because I actually spent a long time working on it.
5113026	5119710	Of course, it's the same one I use on DDR Freak, and on Sub Squad Board, and I would use it on Sack of Money, but we can't have them.
5123913	5124853	We have one thing to say.
5125534	5127275	You don't love us!
5128916	5130257	What the hell was that for?
5130497	5131097	We love you.
5132658	5133719	You guys all ran away.
5141785	5142746	I love everybody.
5142807	5144589	Listen, you guys, I'm a huge slut, okay?
5144649	5150736	I love everybody.
5150776	5151897	I'm getting a lap dance.
5152037	5153219	Three of them, all at once.
5153712	5155273	I'm going to go hide in the corner.
5155414	5167564	Anyway, the link to the new boards are being posted in the chat room now, or if you are too lazy to follow links in the chat room, just go to our site, orangelounge.skie.cx, click on forums, and it takes you to the new forums.
5167865	5168986	And if you don't, we'll kick your ass.
5170207	5170967	You'll lose our love.
5171868	5174891	I don't want to lose your love tonight.
5177151	5177451	Okay.
5178772	5180252	So, definitely check out the new forums.
5181653	5187295	And next week, next Saturday, is a pretty nifty tournament going on in Fremont.
5187415	5187995	Yeah, go.
5188276	5194078	And I think this is the first time, besides Shaft, that all three hosts will be attending a tournament together.
5194098	5194578	All three of us.
5194618	5195078	Am I correct?
5195618	5196599	One of them might be competing.
5197099	5197399	Yeah.
5198019	5198660	Oh, you're going to compete?
5198680	5199580	I want GPA.
5199860	5201021	Oh, very cool.
5201101	5201921	You're not going to compete, Loki.
5201981	5203402	Well, okay, we'll go cheer Jamie on.
5203422	5204342	I may or may not GPA.
5205262	5206003	DCB wants you to pre-reg.
5224424	5229509	If I have the money to, I'm getting Keyboard Mania tomorrow, so my money's kind of tight.
5229829	5230109	Alright.
5230369	5231190	I'll bring the bat, though.
5231811	5233532	Oh, we need to get new bats to have everyone sign.
5233812	5234713	Oh, okay, that's a good idea.
5234793	5239317	I've got to go buy a new orange bat, because everyone signed them at the Mountain Mike's tourney, so I have to buy new bats.
5240706	5241006	Alright.
5241527	5243609	There's the link to the page right there.
5243669	5251455	Radbeats.com slash TildaKillerPal slash Fremont2.html You'll never remember that, so just click the link in the chatroom.
5251675	5251996	Internet.
5253637	5254618	The interweb.
5256380	5261185	You're showing us pictures of... Oh, it's the Ghetto DDR Extreme 8th Mix sign from Stockton Golf Line.
5261205	5261465	Nice.
5261725	5262085	Very nice.
5263347	5268211	Speaking of which, we got to check out the nice Ghetto Max 2 that they're giving away in the cyber returning.
5268572	5269072	Oh my lord.
5269152	5270654	I hope they clean it up.
5270714	5272435	I hope they clean it up a little.
5272455	5273877	I'm looking forward to that tourney a lot.
5274197	5276539	It's a machine, but it's not much of a machine.
5277700	5279302	We got another question in our inbox.
5279402	5280843	I'll answer it.
5282808	5283749	Do you like Big Cock?
5284009	5285110	It's a rude question.
5285130	5286491	I don't think you'll want to answer that one.
5286511	5287011	I do.
5287031	5287291	I do.
5287712	5288592	I love Big Cock.
5289853	5292575	We'll have, okay, we'll have a real guest.
5293596	5296097	Wait, what's the question?
5296117	5299340	They want to know when Orange Lime, no style wants to know when Orange Lime's going to have a real guest.
5299820	5300340	Okay, so...
5302639	5304900	Fuck you, Nostyle!
5305401	5307582	I will shove my foot in your ass.
5307962	5311765	Hey, if you can hook up porn stars coming over here, I'm all for it, okay?
5313226	5315767	Hey, you know, I think somebody just wanted to have their name read on the radio.
5318529	5320050	You had something you wanted to say, Jamie?
5320090	5322231	You're not going to go jump off a bridge with that thing around your neck, are you?
5322271	5323472	Big cock.
5324952	5326092	Is that going to be our special guest?
5326232	5327253	Our big black cock.
5327613	5330393	Alright, tonight's special guest, my cock.
5330554	5331014	Say hello.
5331414	5332514	Is your cock black?
5334515	5335395	I can get a sharpie.
5339656	5341496	Rob's going to have little arrows tattooed.
5341517	5343297	Just dip it in hot fudge or something.
5344777	5346198	That is a big brown cock.
5347178	5348318	A very hot cock.
5349959	5350659	I'm sorry, Rob.
5351930	5357773	I don't know if I like this show reverting to discussions about my cock, but in a way it's kind of cool.
5358733	5359854	You brought it up, my friend.
5361394	5362575	And I'm bringing it up right now.
5365076	5370738	It got all over me.
5372539	5373940	And Rob was delivered a Sharpie.
5375420	5376281	Put it away.
5377001	5377681	Put it on.
5377761	5378402	Put it on.
5379162	5381023	Whatever you do, keep that thing in your pants.
5387644	5388704	Is there a difference?
5391305	5397486	I'd like to see a freestyle routine where somebody just whips their cock out at the end.
5397506	5398867	What song would that be good to?
5399967	5400587	Blow My Whistle.
5400607	5406489	No, we just need to like... No, we need to do a freestyle routine where we throw dildos into the crowd.
5408409	5410490	Or those penis-shaped chocolates.
5410510	5410930	That'll be on...
5412759	5413782	Paranoia or something.
5413802	5415045	You can just flip your cock out.
5417652	5420499	When is somebody going to do a routine where they whip their cock out at the end?
5420540	5420900	Come on.
5422441	5425443	I'm surprised all you comedians out there like to play DDR.
5425483	5426184	Nobody's done it yet.
5426244	5426524	Come on.
5426884	5429186	Or some women play DDR too.
5429226	5429966	Let's see some tits.
5430286	5431807	Let's see a topless DDR routine.
5431847	5432128	Come on.
5433068	5433308	Wait.
5434229	5435470	They have to be good looking.
5437791	5439653	We must make sure there's no food around either.
5440433	5445957	Is that enough female freestylers who think they can have a good routine just by grabbing their boobs?
5447111	5448091	You know, that sucks.
5448391	5449252	That's not good freestyle.
5449272	5451352	What are you talking about that's not good freestyle?
5451953	5453053	It's not good freestyle.
5453433	5456414	It's called stripping, not freestyle.
5457234	5459375	It's good Maxim Magazine, bad freestyle.
5459415	5460835	It's called maybe slut style.
5461195	5465837	Hey, I had a checkmark on all of my, you know, judgy little forms there.
5465937	5467457	Grab boobs 10, okay?
5468818	5471899	I had to make a provision when doing the rules for Shaft.
5472379	5473119	No boob grabbing.
5473539	5476060	Because that doesn't make a good routine.
5478308	5482420	It does not make a good... Okay, that's getting into one of my pet peeves of DDR freestyling.
5482761	5483343	Oh, let's hear it.
5484045	5485248	Don't grab your boobs!
5486475	5487315	I'm sorry.
5487976	5488916	What if I grab my boobs?
5488936	5489396	Is that okay?
5489416	5489816	Okay, wait, wait.
5490056	5492677	What if Alan Rickman got on stage and started whipping out his cock?
5493598	5494818	Okay, first of all, he wouldn't.
5495098	5495458	Okay.
5496239	5497459	But you know what?
5497579	5503241	I don't see the male freestylers grabbing their dick or anything while they're freestyling.
5503521	5506622	I will enter a routine and I will grab my dick during the routine.
5506722	5508583	Will that make you happy if I do my production?
5509143	5510864	Well, then why do you suggest it?
5511324	5512584	I'm using it as an example.
5512605	5512965	Okay.
5512985	5513125	Okay.
5514145	5515146	You know I'm a crazy bastard.
5515186	5515646	I'll do it.
5516427	5519789	I can't freestyle, so at least I'll get a laugh when I grab my dick, you know?
5519809	5521350	Hey, it's a whole new meaning to PA.
5521450	5522130	Penis attack.
5523071	5526013	Hey, Evan.
5528795	5530416	Every day with Rob is a penis attack.
5533078	5534158	I figured out how to make one.
5535219	5535519	Oh, great.
5535539	5536880	We have a double-ended noose.
5536960	5537661	How kinky.
5537761	5540283	That's for the goth sex pervert, right?
5542004	5542684	And it's black.
5542844	5543705	Does it glow in the dark?
5544787	5546028	You tell me, it's yours.
5547329	5548330	You gotta make it all flopsy.
5549031	5550072	Get your own goddamn mic.
5550112	5550873	Hold on a second, hold on a second.
5550893	5551553	Here we go, here we go.
5551793	5553175	Here's the stupidest thing you can do on radio.
5553195	5553955	You can do jump rope.
5554216	5556838	Okay, I'm gonna use the mic, and I'm going to make it funny.
5557298	5557719	Are you ready?
5558139	5562463	Okay, here's a gay man's... Okay, sorry, here's a lesbian's nightmare.
5566667	5568108	Okay, here's a gay man's nightmare.
5572912	5573812	There you go.
5573852	5576313	Nobody in the audience.
5576673	5577894	That was very intentional.
5578194	5579534	Now Rob tried to describe that.
5581415	5582855	I had a question for you, Evan.
5583635	5583915	Evan?
5584976	5588337	Okay, why do you think nobody's whipped their cock out at the end of a DDR routine yet?
5590075	5593617	Because we haven't seen the private DDR routines that Brad and Irene have.
5595557	5597918	Late at night.
5598638	5599119	And you know what?
5599159	5599699	Hold on a second.
5599719	5602480	Before Brad says anything, I do want to make this parting comment.
5602940	5606401	You know, although I haven't seen it, I have heard that Irene's cock is quite nice.
5608462	5609022	Oh boy.
5614864	5616585	Yeah.
5617426	5620748	I think we're going to take a quick break at this point.
5621669	5623030	As Brad goes to break.
5623050	5625232	We've reached our cock quotient of the show.
5625252	5626873	And we're going to come back.
5626893	5627493	Use the ferret.
5628074	5630916	And we're going to play the match game live in studio.
5630936	5631956	We can do list list.
5631976	5633057	We want to do list list first?
5633117	5633457	Yeah.
5634238	5635499	Let's list them match game.
5635599	5636460	We always do match game.
5636480	5637741	We've got to do the cage match some way too.
5637761	5638701	Yeah, we have to do cage match.
5638721	5639562	Let's do the cage match now.
5640022	5640282	Okay.
5640483	5641123	All right, fuck the break.
5641143	5641743	We'll do the cage match.
5642064	5642644	All right, here we go.
5642664	5643425	Woohoo!
5646003	5650367	Alright, we are going to talk about two weeks ago.
5650407	5652449	We didn't do a cage match last week, correct?
5652709	5653890	No, I didn't.
5654050	5667941	So, last week, two weeks ago, in the Orange Lounge cage match, where we pit songs against each other because we like to, we had Ayumi Hamasaki win with Connected in a very, very, very close vote.
5667981	5670123	I believe it came down to a game of rock, paper, scissors.
5670143	5673086	Fuck all of you for not voting for Knight Rider, bitches.
5674085	5676047	Yeah, Knight Rider was the shit, but unfortunately it lost.
5676067	5677788	And fuck me for being bad at rock, paper, scissors.
5679890	5680311	Yeah.
5681452	5689559	Alright, so the first song, you're able to vote for one of three songs in the cage match.
5689579	5691281	You can vote for last week's winner.
5693082	5693743	I'm English today.
5694083	5696726	Here's last week's winner, or two weeks ago's winner.
5696766	5698447	This is Ayumi Hamasaki with Connected.
5698467	5699108	Here's a little clip.
5721992	5723873	Alright, that's the Yumi Hamasaki with Connected.
5723893	5725093	That's the first one you can vote for.
5725113	5725934	That's last week's winner.
5726554	5731736	This first pick in the cage match, this is a group called Bond with a song called Fuego.
5731777	5733917	Jamie, do you want to enter this and introduce this for us?
5734798	5736399	It's short, cool, and fuego.
5736739	5737319	Alright, here it is.
5737399	5739420	This is the first song in the cage match you can vote for this week.
5740060	5742281	Second song, I'm sorry, you can vote for Yumi Hamasaki or you can vote for this.
5742301	5743582	This is Bond with Fuego.
5748144	5748966	Thanks for watching!
5802443	5802977	Thanks for watching!
5907058	5907158	Okay.
5907318	5908539	I love that song.
5908599	5909800	Anything with the name Fuego.
5909880	5911161	Because I like fire.
5930854	5932375	That was a pretty neat song.
5932435	5933416	What did you all think of that?
5933436	5934557	Let's go around the room.
5934597	5936459	What did you think of it and judge it on a scale of 1 to 10?
5936619	5937300	It's awesome, 10.
5938561	5940703	I think Fuego tastes pretty good, that soda.
5941303	5941904	Oh, Fuego.
5942164	5943265	That is a really cool song.
5943345	5944987	Somebody should make steps for that for DDR.
5945787	5946148	Loki?
5946848	5947449	Don't look at me.
5947469	5948730	I'm not going to friggin' make that.
5949611	5952193	I give it an 8 because it just sounds like Vanessa May.
5954355	5954815	I'll do it.
5954835	5954815	7.
5954855	5955035	Good.
5957382	5957883	Angel says,
5971765	5974187	9.5!
5973226	5974187	She says 5 instead.
5975228	5978470	I agree, it's Vanessa made the sequel, but it's still pretty cool, so I give it a 9.
5979031	5982874	Alright, moving on, the next song, Loki, tell us about this one.
5982894	5984675	Now we're only going to play part of this song, correct?
5985035	5986496	Yeah, because it's like an 8 minute long song.
5986516	5989359	So we're going to play a few minutes of it, so tell us about this song.
5989419	5993682	This song was entered in Tourney Mix 3, the cut down version of it was.
5994302	5999925	This is an mp3.com artist, which should be going mainstream, I hope, soon.
6000425	6002687	It's Airbase with their song Spin.
6002787	6005748	Alright, and after this is over, you can vote for this one if you want.
6005788	6007189	This is Airbase with Spin.
6043213	6044316	Thanks for watching!
6219764	6221248	Thank you for watching!
6276474	6277535	Thanks for watching!
6354891	6358194	All right, that was Airbase with a song called Spin.
6358214	6359255	That wasn't even the whole thing.
6360256	6362538	So, that's the end of the cage match.
6362558	6363438	I live for Holic.
6363458	6364099	Three songs.
6364479	6370124	You have Yumi Hamasaki, last week's winner with Connected, Bond with Fuego, and Airbase with Spin.
6370664	6371985	You guys can vote now.
6372065	6374307	Send your votes over private message to Sky.
6375048	6377450	And while you send your votes, let's hear the verdicts on Airbase.
6377690	6377930	Rob?
6378190	6378391	What?
6378551	6378791	Rob?
6379011	6379251	Yes?
6379351	6379571	Hi.
6379672	6379932	Hi.
6380652	6382314	It was repetitive.
6382874	6383755	He's always repetitive.
6383955	6384596	Scale of 1 to 10.
6384976	6390041	I would probably play that in the background while I'm working on banners and stuff and doing my artwork.
6390521	6391182	So I'd give it a 7.5.
6391222	6391182	7.5.
6391302	6391542	Alright.
6391582	6392363	It's more dancey stuff.
6397537	6405299	and there's nothing wrong with dancey stuff, it's supposed to be long because it's a 12 inch mix so you can mix it into other shit, but anyways, SHUT UP!
6408000	6421043	Anyways, um, I like it, it was one of my favorite entries in Attorney Mix 3, I wish I could have had a chance to cut it down so that it'd be less repetitive, but anyways, um, I give it a 10.
6422564	6422905	All right.
6423125	6424848	Brad, what did you think of Airbase's spin?
6425208	6426991	Cool, but they should have DDR-sized it.
6427011	6427572	It would have been great.
6428754	6431659	So I'd give it a 7 as it is.
6432240	6432540	All right.
6434002	6435425	Dave, what you heard of it?
6436540	6437081	By the way, hi.
6437361	6438041	Yeah, hi.
6438782	6447288	I just kind of came in and took pictures, but I guess I was kind of listening, so I give it a seven and a half.
6447589	6448349	You're full of shit.
6448709	6449070	Magus.
6450451	6450791	Late.
6451051	6451432	Ten.
6451572	6451952	Beer.
6452252	6452412	Out.
6453013	6453493	Stressa.
6453933	6454974	Well, that was easily said.
6455455	6458537	Um, I actually am quite fond of this track, I think.
6459617	6460458	Wow, such spirit.
6461258	6461879	I'm going to give that an 8.
6464360	6464661	Alright.
6464901	6465541	I'm tied.
6466061	6466722	Angel, what do you think?
6467002	6468043	I said I'm tied.
6468263	6474707	It's kind of a bow thing.
6476469	6477609	I'll give it an 8, sorry.
6477970	6478530	Alright, an 8.
6480291	6485235	I liked it, it was cool, except I didn't like that wee, wee, wee part, and Bond was better.
6485275	6488537	Fuego was better, so I can't rank it higher than that, so I'll give it an 8.
6489560	6492961	Alright, so the votes are coming in right now.
6493101	6495502	We'll tally them up a little later.
6495902	6497903	I need to send you all He-Man likes big butts.
6498923	6500303	I'll find that file and send it to you later.
6501484	6506845	So you can vote for Ayumi, you can vote for Bond with Fuego, or you can vote for Airbase.
6507986	6509346	Rob's good at typing with one hand.
6510006	6510807	I'm typing with one hand.
6510827	6512667	I wonder how you got so good, Rob.
6512687	6514188	Okay, so we'll tally those votes.
6514548	6518229	During the next segment, ladies and gentlemen, it's time once again for...
6520000	6521768	The Orange Lounge Match Game
6522817	6524779	Now tonight is special.
6524939	6528661	Usually we let the chatroom play along, and we do encourage them to play along.
6528701	6531863	However, we have so many people in studio tonight, we're going to have live contestants.
6532324	6534385	So we can get live reactions and everything like that.
6534785	6538868	So if you guys want to play along in the chatroom, you can send us your suggestions.
6538888	6539488	That would be great.
6540009	6542911	But in the meantime, our contestants for tonight will be our out-of-town visitors.
6542951	6546633	Say hello to Stressa, and DDR Angel will be your contestant tonight.
6546893	6548454	Hello again.
6549055	6549335	All right.
6549375	6551436	So they will be competing against each other for what?
6551456	6552277	What's the prize tonight?
6553617	6554358	A ride home.
6554378	6555138	A big black cock.
6555538	6558720	A big black cock is what you're playing for tonight.
6561441	6562301	And petting rights.
6566743	6568764	Fair enough.
6568784	6571045	The prize is a handful of Jamie's nuts.
6572166	6573086	They can't have my nuts.
6573146	6576367	I need those.
6577688	6579809	Let's go around and quickly introduce the celebrities.
6579869	6581270	Celebrity number one.
6581290	6581930	We'll start in the back.
6584609	6585489	3M, once again, what's up?

6603665	6603945	Let's see.
6605365	6605805	First question.
6605885	6612307	Oh, but unfortunately, what we're going to have to do while we contemplate our answers, I'm going to have to ask our contestants to leave the room for a minute.
6612467	6612727	Get out!
6612747	6614768	While we get our answers, and we'll send somebody to come get you.
6614788	6616068	Isolation booth.
6616088	6617549	Yes, you have to go to your isolation booth.
6618969	6621210	Because we're basically, I think to speed this up a little...
6622182	6630589	Isolation Booth, Booth, Booth, Booth, Booth, Booth, Booth, Booth equals Animal Crossing, goodbye!
6631710	6632551	Alright, alright, here we go.

6636855	6638136	Okay, here we go, here's the first question.
6640998	6641779	First question.
6641799	6642099	Wait.
6643177	6647219	Sammy the Snacker loves to eat and play DDR at the same time.
6647939	6654402	When the arcade manager came over, he took one look at the pad and said, Damn it, Sammy, you got blank all over the dance pad.
6662585	6665906	Sammy the Snacker loves to eat and play DDR at the same time.
6666507	6672029	When the arcade manager came by, he took one look at the pad and said, Damn it, Sammy, you got blank all over the dance pad.
6678491	6679312	Is everybody locked in?
6679592	6682534	I can't read my writing because you gave me a fucking highlighter.
6683475	6685637	Here, can we find him another pen?
6688299	6692002	Here, we can share if you want.
6692042	6694344	Chat room suggesting things like salty slut nuts.
6696145	6700189	Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sorry, that was the, they tricked me, god damn them.
6701470	6702351	They got me to say slut.
6705017	6705718	Back to the match game.
6706598	6710441	Damn it, Sammy, you got blank all over the dance pad.
6711582	6713504	The word of the day is slut.
6718828	6719829	Alright, everybody locked in?
6719889	6720269	We all ready?

6723552	6724753	Alright, alright, bring him in, bring him in.
6729136	6730778	We could use this opportunity to talk shit about him.
6731698	6734541	Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
6735899	6736620	I'm talking shit.

6738681	6740043	Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
6740083	6741484	We have some other good answers here.
6741784	6742845	Orange-flavored cum.
6743605	6744106	Dandruff.
6744967	6745967	Oreo candy cream.
6747248	6747969	Murder cream.
6748449	6748770	Nuts.
6749030	6750791	Okay, here we go.
6752012	6752633	Here they are.
6752693	6753774	All right, let's mic them up.
6753854	6755415	All right, here we go.
6756436	6757317	This is the question.
6758485	6761990	Sammy the Snacker loves to eat and play DDR at the same time.
6762351	6768800	When the arcade manager came over, he took one look at the pad and said, Damn it, Sammy, you got blank all over the dance pad.
6769822	6771785	Dressa, you're first, because you're pointing at the other person.
6772958	6774058	I love that, volunteering.
6774459	6783522	Um, I would like to think that the manager said, Dammit, Sammy, you've got animal cookie heads all over the dance pad.
6783762	6784182	Cool!
6784302	6786023	Animal cookie heads, alright.
6786603	6787944	Stress is answers, animal cookie heads.
6788144	6788864	Let's hear from Angel.
6789384	6790565	Dammit, Sammy, you've got...
6791505	6792366	Vanilla Crack!
6792646	6794768	Vanilla Crack all over the dance pad.
6794808	6797311	Alright, let's go around and see what the answers are.
6797831	6800134	Jamie, dammit Sammy, you got... Pussy!
6800374	6802516	Pussy all over the dance pad, I'm sorry.
6803317	6804578	That is not a match.
6805119	6806260	Pussy is not a match.
6807161	6807281	Loki!
6807301	6808362	Dammit Sammy, you got...
6814298	6815539	Your salty nuts!
6816139	6817140	All over the dance pad.
6817400	6818120	Oh, very good.

7452550	7457191	Instead of her big black cock, it's going to be her big black cock.
7457991	7459271	Her big black cock.

7511854	7512395	Oh, I'm sorry, Magus.
7512435	7513376	Oh, he's hiding behind me.
7514056	7515197	Well, how's that match?
7515878	7518981	The first time I saw Fiona, she was showing her ass off through her skirt.

7544202	7546423	No, it's just... It's all a tribute show to Ruben.
7546604	7548645	It's just big black cock day, didn't get the memo?

7667595	7667895	Okay.
7668015	7668775	We'll take a break at some point.
7668795	7669476	Here's the question.
7670196	7670556	What's on?
7670916	7673797	The staff of Orange Lounge... Are you ready?
7674317	7677218	The staff of Orange Lounge most likes to talk about blank.
7677978	7678418	Oh, here it is.
7679198	7680118	Angel, your first this time.
7680158	7687020	The staff of Orange Lounge most likes to talk about... And $50 goes to... Big Black Cock!
7687280	7689341	Big Black Cock, says Angel.
7689861	7690381	Good answer.
7690541	7693582	Stressa, the staff of Orange Lounge most likes to talk about...
7694878	7699702	Well, considering the current flow of conversation... Don't say the same thing.
7699742	7701183	That's not how you break a tie.
7705867	7706587	That's true.
7707768	7708929	Yeah, it might be trick.
7710230	7715654	I'm going to be out there in left field, and since I don't have much else on my head at this minute, propel.
7716155	7717015	Propel.
7717216	7717736	Very good.
7717796	7719557	Okay, so we have Big Black Cock and we have Propel.
7720218	7724001	Jamie, the staff of Orange Lounge most likes to talk about...
7724727	7725548	Big Black Cock!
7725648	7726829	Big Black Cock!
7726909	7728611	That's a match, alright, good job.
7729211	7729591	One match.
7731733	7732354	Angel is leading.
7732914	7735437	Bomani, you freaking sicko freaks!
7735477	7737519	What do you think this show's about?
7737799	7738540	Bomani.
7739340	7741422	No, it's not a match, and a vicious lie.
7741802	7742103	Dave!
7744079	7747443	They most like to talk about my big black cock.
7747503	7747883	What?
7749625	7750446	That's a half point.
7750806	7752728	So Angel gets another half point.
7752748	7754030	No, it's a full point, baby.
7754090	7756312	Alright, a full point.
7756412	7757454	Angel leads by two.
7757594	7759636	It's a full foot long of points.
7760096	7760357	Alright.
7760717	7763780	Brad, most likes to talk about dead babies.
7768379	7771680	That didn't get picked up on the mic in that sound.
7772000	7773281	Skinny white cunt!
7774361	7775621	Skinny white cunt.
7776542	7777422	What did you call me?
7779243	7780463	Skinny white cunt!
7781983	7782924	I thought so.
7787885	7788085	Oh!
7788465	7789746	Wait, Fiona's not white.
7792719	7794560	Oh, was that my outer monologue?
7794600	7795761	I thought that was my inner voice.
7795781	7797162	Is this white or pink?
7797402	7799143	Is this... This whole weekend?
7800004	7801084	Wait, wait, excuse me.
7801605	7804807	Nobody saw this, but I just got hit by the door three times.
7805127	7806788	My ass got hit by the door three times.
7806848	7807288	Thank you.
7807628	7808509	Okay, quick question.
7808649	7809369	FU goes to the door.
7810450	7810990	Quick question.
7811971	7814573	Female Asians with big breasts, man-made or myth?
7817254	7819656	I think we should go on to our next answer.
7820748	7823029	Oh yeah, mine was Dead Babies, because nobody probably heard that.
7824310	7825371	Or we forgot, I don't know.
7825411	7828132	I had to go for the obligatory, Propel!
7828533	7828913	Yes!
7831715	7836057	No, you are up by one point, so if I said Propel, we go to another tiebreaker round.
7837018	7838599	If I said Big Black Cock...
7839784	7840885	Angel's going to win by a lead.
7840905	7842166	Angel gets a big black card.
7842186	7847690	My answer was, on Orange Lounge, we talk about Ted DDR.
7850592	7851313	Angel wins.
7851693	7854215	Angel, go get a handful of Jamie's Big Nuts.
7855736	7856516	That's your prize.
7856977	7857757	Just get your hand in there.
7857797	7860079	Oh yeah, scoop them all up.
7860159	7860659	Now lick them.
7860699	7861360	Put it in your mouth.
7862621	7863161	Do it, bitch.
7867370	7868591	You know you want to suck the nuts.
7868611	7870431	Here they go, come on, come on, come on, go, go.
7872452	7873313	Oh, she's gagging.
7876394	7877615	Too hot for her to handle.
7880076	7881537	She's got a mouth full of nuts.
7881737	7882037	Yeah.
7882877	7883978	All right, that's it.
7884038	7886199	And once again, my nuts are safe for consumption.
7886219	7886659	We're going to go.
7889284	7894928	And with that, I think that we have a very appropriate song here to be playing.
7895649	7897770	It's going to be called Cramming for College.
7898350	7902173	So, do enjoy.
7903854	7904455	Alright, enjoy.
7904495	7907196	This is our next break music because Loki wants to hear it.
7907236	7908397	This is called Cramming for College.
7908738	7908958	Yes?
7909418	7911299	Public announcement, I think I just pissed myself.
7912280	7912600	Okay.
7913561	7914221	You smell funny.
7916164	7917785	I was just scared I sold my armor.
7918165	7918645	All right.
7918785	7919805	I hope you enjoyed the match game.
7919825	7920325	We'll be right back.
7920345	7923907	If you want to send us an email, orangelauncheradio.yahoo.com if you have more questions for us.
7923947	7925407	In the meantime, we have to tabulate the votes.
7925447	7927148	In the meantime, we've got to tabulate the votes.
7927248	7930829	We'll do that during this break for the cage match, and we will be right back.
7931869	7932769	Okay, class.
7933129	7935150	Our final exam will be coming up at the end of this week.
7935170	7936671	Our final exam will be in Big Bot Con.
7936691	7938811	The test will be comprised of 20% written, 30% oral, and 50% anal.
7938871	7939652	Any questions?
7944847	7945588	Professor?
7946128	7946589	Yes, dear?
7947109	7949431	Will there be any extra credit?
7950192	7952073	I am so glad you asked.
8038731	8039318	Thanks for watching!
8104518	8105325	Thanks for watching!
8223201	8233650	I don't know what it is about you that's got me feeling mesmerized Each hour lets you get away while you're the lucky one
8249021	8252795	I got my hands full up as it is But I want you Gonna put you
8282018	8283160	Thank you for watching!
8303171	8305873	Hi, I don't have another song queued up, so I'm going to find one right now.
8306354	8314661	I know, let's do another song from the new DDR that everybody's freaking... DDR Explain.
8315722	8316662	...wetting their pants about.
8316683	8317203	Where is it?
8317283	8319265	Isn't it on... Oh, I'm looking at the wrong CD.
8319705	8320205	It's on your CD?
8320286	8321186	Okay, okay, never mind.
8322367	8322948	Okay, we'll do this.
8322968	8328773	We'll do Paranoia Survivor from the new DDR Extreme, and then we'll come back and we've got a list list for you guys.
8428107	8429349	Orange Lounge Radio.
8429689	8431831	We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.
8438158	8440100	We're back, Orange Lounge Radio.
8440561	8444585	And everybody is furiously working on their list, because we are going to do a list list.
8445206	8448690	But first, I want to announce the winner of the cage match.
8449707	8451149	Very close, by the way.
8451269	8456958	This song won, the other two were tied, and this song had one vote more than the other two.
8457079	8458220	So it was very close.
8458701	8462647	The winner of this week's cage match, once again, Ayumi Hamasaki with Connected.
8468604	8472645	Alright, so that goes into a rotation on the station for another week.
8472665	8473906	How are you doing over there, Jamie?
8474246	8475326	I'm ready to do the list list.
8475506	8478747	You're having that sad, sad spinster look on your face.
8478767	8488011	It's because my number three song, I'm trying to imagine, my number three choice, I'm trying to imagine what it would be like, because we haven't even announced our list list yet, what it's going to be.
8488451	8489131	Why don't you tell them?
8489431	8492012	Well, we're doing one for Top Song...
8493169	8494633	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8501360	8501660	Fireball
8532970	8534471	I think that song would be funny in 2DX.
8535511	8537252	I can kind of imagine how it would go.
8537272	8541293	You know, you can only get so much of the trance and Eurobeat stuff.
8541313	8543234	I'd like to see something a little funky in 2DX.
8543294	8546895	So Fireball is my number three pick for what ought to be in 2DX from another Blondie game.
8547375	8548096	Let's go over to Angel.
8548856	8551637	Your number three choice is... Oh, you only have two so far?
8553878	8555198	Actually, yes, that song is on it.
8556499	8557379	Angel's got to think of another one?
8558400	8558640	Okay.
8559920	8560320	You had one?
8561901	8562181	All right.
8564804	8565425	Number three choice.
8566765	8567346	Tokyo Already.
8567926	8569767	Tokyo Already, that's a pretty good one.
8570888	8573009	It's your beat and your beat's getting big in 2DX.
8574509	8577251	Tokyo Already, pretty cool song from Dance Maniacs, right?
8578772	8580653	Alright, Monkey Dance is already in 2DX, dummy.
8581673	8583654	Stressa, your number three pick.
8585335	8588417	Okay, I know it might sound a little hokey, but the...
8589168	8592670	Idea of having Like a Virgin might be kind of interesting.
8593030	8595052	Like a Virgin from Parapara.
8597913	8598994	I'd want it just for that part.
8599014	8600955	That'd be pretty cool.
8604037	8604937	Did you already go, Jimmy?
8605938	8606718	We're going around this way.
8606778	8607058	Okay.
8608099	8610781	My number three, badly, is Superstar.
8611121	8612201	Superstar.
8614043	8615824	I knew you were going to think about that one.
8615904	8616784	Superstar.
8617565	8617945	Loki.
8617965	8618045	Loki.
8619385	8621728	This is one of my favorite Dance Maniacs tracks.
8621788	8622869	It's Mind Parasite.
8623249	8624271	Mind Parasite.
8624291	8625051	Interesting choice.
8627073	8627694	From Dance Maniacs.
8628115	8628755	Jamie, you're number three.
8629276	8630978	You said you were going... I was going last.
8631238	8631618	Yeah, you are.
8631798	8631919	Oh.
8635081	8636062	Thanks for watching!
8656654	8661636	I'm going to get Hell from Jamie, but I chose Dark Black Forest as my second choice I don't hate the song, it's just overplayed
8686345	8687168	I would have to agree with that.
8687990	8689996	Dark Black Forest should be in 2DX.
8690799	8691240	Stress out.
8691601	8692624	My second choice...
8693675	8693915	Why?
8693975	8714525	Because I love the beats Boom Boom Dollar Boom Boom Dollar Oh my god, Boom Boom Dollar and 2BX I'm completely sad and pathetic Would be fucking hilarious Have mercy Gee, I thought it was going to be Bumblebee That would be fucking funny, I'm sorry I give it a point for comic value Brad What?
8715226	8715486	What?
8716246	8717707	Nothing, Dave was just making a joke
8718243	8721085	He said that he was going to burn his PS2 to the ground if that was on.
8721125	8726329	Then I'd be like, yes, and then I'd take the ashes and let it rise like a phoenix back into a PS2 and then I'd play it.
8726889	8727930	Uh, Brad, you're number two pick.
8728951	8730892	Well, thanks to the comedy killer.
8732013	8734715	My number two pick is Ecstasy, because that song kicks ass.
8734735	8735435	It owns you all.
8738057	8739118	It'd be like having insertion.
8741172	8742393	Ecstasy, Loki.
8742893	8751958	Well, it's only fitting since, you know, if we're talking about a new mix of 2DX, it would obviously be with the new mix of DDR, so why not the Legend of Max?
8752558	8753979	Legend of Max.
8754580	8755700	My fingers would fall off.
8757161	8757901	My turn, my turn, my turn.
8757921	8758762	It feels like burning.
8759222	8760143	Jamie, you're number two pick.
8760163	8760843	It feels like burning heat.
8761604	8762344	My baby mama.
8762804	8763945	My baby mama.
8764765	8767427	Think about playing the bass line with that.
8768067	8769468	Do-do, do-do, do-do.
8769750	8770470	All right, good pick.
8770650	8772011	All right, wow, we got a big list already.
8772031	8773552	It's because there's so many of us participating tonight.
8773812	8775093	All right, the number one picks.
8775113	8775493	Here we go.
8775533	8779375	The number one song that ought to be in 2DX from another Bomani game.
8779875	8783116	My choice, Gamlande Couple from Mambo.
8783737	8785818	Because that song would kick so much ass in 2DX.
8785838	8786238	I'm sorry.
8789199	8790060	That's the Mambo one.
8791360	8792541	You fucking bastard.
8792921	8794242	That's okay.
8794262	8795102	We can have a dupe.
8795122	8795522	That's fine.
8795682	8796203	We can have a dupe.
8796223	8796603	That's fine.
8797083	8797423	All right.
8798424	8798704	Angel.
8800638	8803359	Okay, this is my personal favorite at the moment.
8803959	8804859	I chose Eurobeat.
8805520	8807000	Eurobeat, go!
8807320	8811141	Well, 6th style had a lot of pair of songs in it, so Eurobeat would definitely fit in.
8811842	8813862	So Eurobeat, Angel's number one choice.
8815243	8821205	Well, since we talked about... Oh, I'm being told that Gamelan Day Couple's in Beatmania the final.
8821625	8822205	Can somebody give me...
8823377	8826718	Oh yeah, that's right, we're talking about 2DX, not 5Key, 2DX.
8827018	8827398	Ha ha!
8828358	8828738	7Key stuff.
8829078	8829618	That's right, thank you.
8830158	8834399	I didn't know that though, that's still pretty cool if it's in Beatmania the final, but that's not 2DX.
8835039	8835339	Ha ha.
8836020	8841861	Um, my first, since we talked about burning, let's talk about some burning heat.
8842621	8843961	Burning heat is in 2DX, actually.
8844141	8844541	Burning heat?
8845021	8845121	Oh.
8845822	8846082	Whoops.
8846102	8846442	Well then.
8847622	8848982	Yes, sucks to be me.
8851043	8851743	Let me think some more.
8851783	8852843	Okay.
8854352	8855472	Alright, we'll come back to Streza.
8855792	8856633	Oops.
8857293	8863975	Okay, my number one, and the best song in the world, the Miracle Moon remix by L.E.D.
8864335	8866696	Which was in Beatmania as well, but needs to be in 2DX.
8866716	8869797	It needs to be in 2DX with harder notes and stuff, that would be awesome.
8870777	8871838	I would jizz in my panties.
8876579	8877659	I think I'm gonna take my noose off now.
8882460	8890844	Since Rob was a bastard and stole my number one, I'm going to just pick this really way off one here.
8891764	8892385	Kachaka.
8893125	8893865	Kachaka.
8893885	8895826	I almost picked that.
8897487	8899268	I think I spelled Kachaka wrong, but whatever.
8901489	8902109	My number one?
8903550	8904050	Klung Klung.
8904811	8905691	Klung Klung.
8906151	8907072	Oh, good one.
8910615	8912257	Good one from Keyboard Mania.
8912297	8912898	That's a good pick.
8913138	8914239	Did Stresso come up with one?
8914259	8915140	How about Captain Jack?
8915741	8916682	Captain Jack!
8916702	8919845	Because no Bombani game is complete without Captain Jack.
8919885	8920326	Beautiful.
8920646	8921867	And if he wasn't there, he'd cry.
8925912	8926472	Did you shut that?
8926712	8927053	Was that you?
8931100	8947420	Fireball, Tokyo Already, Like A Virgin, Superstar, Mind Parasite, On The Jazz, Ghosts, Dark Black Forest, Boom Boom Dollar, S2Z, Legend of Max, why is it saying that Boom is misspelled?
8948041	8952523	Legend of Max, My Baby Mama, Guacamole De Couple, Eurobeat, Miracle Moon LED Mix, Kachaka, Clone Clone 1655, and Captain Jack.
8963553	8963873	Nice.
8965434	8967334	Some votes from the chat room.
8967815	8970696	They said we didn't put any erotic on this list and they're very sad.
8970716	8971996	There's already erotic though in 5Key.
8972316	8973457	There is erotic in 5Key.
8973497	8975357	There's actually Captain Jack in 5Key as well.
8976138	8977038	Anyway, that's 5Key.
8977078	8977418	It's not 2DX.
8977478	8978218	It's not the same thing.
8978858	8980279	Here's everybody's favorite part.
8980319	8984641	It's the elimination round where one song, sorry kids, it's got to come off this list.
8984681	8985481	This is a hard one.
8986461	8988263	Um, I guess I'll start.
8988943	8993367	One song that's gotta come off this list, uh, for 2DX that I don't want to see in 2DX.
8994348	8999352	Um... Boom Boom Dollar.
8999452	9001394	That's forever and always a DDR song.
9001414	9002935	I don't see it in 2DX, sorry.
9003395	9004576	So I'm taking Boom Boom Dollar off the list.
9005937	9007419	Angel, take one of these songs off the list.
9009400	9009941	Big list.
9010942	9011442	It is a big list.
9013203	9014745	Do do do do do do do.
9016565	9017805	The Guacamole song.
9019046	9020406	Oh, damn you.
9020506	9021107	Damn you.
9021867	9022107	Why?
9022147	9023027	Because I don't know it.
9023087	9023647	My bad.
9025168	9026208	We should play that during the break then.
9026228	9027229	You're a bad woman.
9028049	9029810	Rob, I just heard the news.
9030890	9032891	I heard that you have a bad case of balloon fight.
9034911	9036412	I've heard that Penicillin can cure this.
9037112	9037872	Along with Sega.
9040413	9041754	Sega!
9042274	9043134	What are you doing here?
9044655	9045835	Molesting you, apparently.
9048493	9049553	Hold on a second, okay, I'll see here.
9049753	9051474	Fireball took it already, like a virgin.
9051494	9053195	Superstar, Mind Parasite, I'm the Jazz.
9053455	9058036	Ghost, Dark Black Forest, Ecstasy, Legend of Max, My Baby Mama, Eurobeat.
9059437	9059897	Eurobeat?
9061658	9062238	Miracle Moon.
9063988	9064629	What the hell is that?
9064649	9065109	T'Chaka.
9065229	9065829	T'Chaka.
9066810	9070453	Klung Klung 1655 and Captain Jack.
9070593	9071014	Captain Jack.
9071334	9072275	I'll tell you what, here we go.
9072415	9073976	Just delete everything except Captain Jack.
9074636	9075437	It's all set.
9076158	9077759	Yes, Captain Jack is loved.
9078339	9078720	All right.
9081162	9081882	Moving along.
9082302	9083844	Stressa, what comes off the list?
9084344	9088567	I'm sorry, Angel, but Dark Black Forest must go.
9089288	9089828	It's all good.
9089868	9090409	I don't hate you.
9091900	9092861	You'll get a beating later.
9093161	9093542	I do.
9094163	9094503	Jerk.
9094964	9095284	Alright.
9095705	9096105	Badly.
9096626	9097387	I want to go last.
9098248	9098509	Tough.
9100231	9100752	I want a pony.
9101753	9101993	Anyway.
9105615	9108357	I don't want to piss anybody off because they'll take mine away.
9109378	9111600	I'm going to have to go with Captain Jack.
9112941	9116183	You bastard taking Captain Jack off the list.
9116864	9117704	I hope you die.
9117924	9118925	That's alright.
9118965	9119406	I'm just kidding.
9119706	9124690	As payback for you taking off my song from the list, I still say you're a dirty cowgirl!
9126891	9127352	Loki.
9128673	9137299	Just because I'm not a huge fan of this song in both DDR and Beatmania, buh-bye, Miracle Moon.
9138500	9139421	Miracle Moon.
9140602	9142503	Hey, you will rot in hell for this.
9142823	9144044	Miracle Moon comes off the list.
9144064	9146406	The weed of crime bears bitter fruit, you old hag.
9146426	9148167	Everything's come off the number one end.
9148247	9150249	Anyway, heroin Miracle Moon.
9150949	9151690	Damn you, Loki.
9152530	9155693	Jamie gets the privilege of being the last one to remove a song.
9159085	9165528	I think I'm going to have to go with taking off Eurobeat.
9166749	9171031	Just because as far as having a Eurobeat song goes in 2DX, that one wouldn't be much of a challenge.
9171831	9175893	It doesn't have a lot of neat synthy stuff going on.
9176234	9180636	So we have the final list that our chatroom now gets to vote on.
9181256	9183637	Send me your votes over a private message in the chatroom right now.
9183717	9185218	Jamie, tell them what their picks are.
9185478	9196526	Fireball, Tokyo Already, Like A Virgin, Superstar, Mind Parasite, On The Jazz, Ghosts, Estacy, Legend of Max, My Baby Mama, Kachaka, and Kling Kling 6055.
9196586	9198968	Sky's Voice, the game is not an option.
9199008	9201690	If you vote for that, it doesn't count.
9201810	9202751	Don't waste your vote.
9202771	9206354	By the way, this is yet another week that all of my choices have stayed up.
9207495	9208355	You're special.
9208595	9208916	I am.
9211137	9212999	My movie pick got voted off last week.
9214028	9219763	And just for Angel and anyone else that may not know, here it is, Gamland, a couple, while we tally the votes.
9219843	9220525	Send them in right now.
9327441	9328262	Thanks for watching!
9358326	9358988	Thanks for watching!
9485443	9486685	I don't know.
9526551	9527112	Thank you for watching!
9563321	9564248	Thank you for watching
9590901	9604124	No, no, nobody loves me, no, nobody loves me, no, nobody loves me, I'm takin' your heart
9619893	9622176	Bitch, get a new song.
9622276	9624979	An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
9635086	9637186	We are back and I'm having my picture taken.
9637607	9638447	Oh, there, that was fun.
9638827	9639107	Alright.
9639807	9640027	Wee.
9640527	9641987	Hey, I got flashed by Angel.
9642007	9642568	That was pretty cool.
9644008	9650669	We have the results, ladies and gentlemen, of the listless song from any other Bomani game that ought to be in 2DX.
9651570	9652230	That isn't yet.
9652790	9653330	And here it is.
9653430	9654670	The number three choice.
9655230	9657591	You voted Superstar.
9659371	9660992	Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.
9661032	9662052	Brad, can't you do the rap?
9662092	9662832	Can you do the rap for us?
9664943	9667925	Don't make me bust out my white honky rap skills on y'all ass.
9667965	9669165	Come on, Emma Brad.
9669185	9670846	I don't even remember how it goes.
9671767	9672567	My name is Chaos.
9672587	9673108	No, it's my name.
9673128	9673708	That's all I remember.
9674008	9675409	I am here and my name is Chaos.
9675449	9675929	Whatever.
9676730	9679051	Rap is to me like VD is to Amadeus.
9682173	9682613	Anyway.
9683614	9684494	Number two pick.
9684534	9685115	You picked it.
9685275	9687136	The number two winner is Klunk Klunk 1655.
9687196	9687516	Winner.
9687556	9689177	I'm winner.
9689217	9689877	Winner.
9690558	9691779	Keyboard Mania, In the House.
9692459	9692859	Ought to be on TDR.
9692879	9693139	In the House.
9695538	9709042	and the winner, this kind of makes me sad a little bit, because I know it'll be in 2DX anyway, but you did vote it, your number one choice, by quite a landslide, ladies and gentlemen, Legend of Max, as the song that ought to be in 2DX.
9709062	9710743	Then why didn't anyone take it off the list?
9711043	9713624	You're all groaning, but why didn't anyone take it off the list if you don't like it?
9715384	9716145	Oh, I see, I see.
9716245	9716665	What'd you say?
9718725	9723087	I said... That sounded like a wet shit.
9725794	9730300	Well, alright, that was the winning song.
9730340	9735066	Hey, don't give me dots, don't give me dots, you voted it, alright?
9735727	9736908	Yeah, it's your fault.
9737269	9738010	It's your fault.
9739045	9740065	Rob's Voice The Game!
9740385	9741506	Rob's Voice The Game!
9742326	9742946	Why?
9743226	9743626	Why?
9744067	9746967	What would a game to my voice be?
9747047	9747788	It'd be awesome.
9748448	9753249	I could make a song using your voice as the, you know, kind of like... Fine.
9753349	9755290	It'll be called Legend of Let Them Move.
9755730	9758511	The honorary number one winner is Sky's Voice The Game.
9758551	9759091	Are you happy?
9760471	9760952	Are you happy?
9762052	9762232	No.
9764648	9767892	How about Pantsless Rage, the game?
9768253	9768674	Okay!
9769975	9771217	Pantsless Rage wins!
9774241	9778367	Like that game Seaman from Dreamcast, except it's going to be rage and he's going to be pantsless.
9779328	9780750	Is he going to grow from a mushroom?
9781880	9782180	Yes.
9783080	9784941	After you take the mushrooms, you'll see them grow.
9785521	9791202	You know what's funny is you're growing that guy, Seaman, and he ends up being a boss in a Konami game.
9791242	9792382	What is up with that, you know?
9793643	9798484	Doesn't that guy from Seaman look just like the boss that's in Contra, the new Contra game?
9799164	9799364	Yeah.
9799924	9800904	Yeah, the shriveled space piece.
9800924	9801665	Oh, I'm coming undone.
9801685	9802465	Ah, ah, ah.
9804085	9804445	Oh, shit.
9804465	9805166	Talking about that fish.
9805806	9806106	Yeah.
9806286	9808167	I got it all over the ground.
9809307	9813109	They're suggesting in the chat room that Rob's voice the game Slut Edition.
9816030	9816971	That is so you are.
9818231	9818751	Who told?
9819091	9821512	I don't know what y'all got against politics.
9821712	9823933	Gumby says Pantsless Sky voiced the game.
9824133	9824494	No.
9824734	9825474	Hell no.
9826334	9826514	Hell no.
9826534	9827675	But you wanted to show off your cock.
9828855	9830016	Only in a freestyle routine.
9830036	9832378	I'm not going to show off my cock.
9832398	9833358	What are you talking about?
9833398	9834259	That's just radio.
9834579	9835420	That's radio funny.
9835460	9836400	Oh, you weren't here for that.
9836901	9841684	I said, why doesn't anybody in a DDR freestyle routine whip out their cock at the end of an event?
9842665	9844146	Everyone knows you're just a big old slut.
9845246	9845567	Ha ha.
9846107	9848108	I'm sorry, I heard it was a male slut.
9848269	9849649	Why does everybody think I'm a slut?
9849690	9851791	I haven't gotten laid in forever and you all think I'm a slut?
9851931	9853192	Slut, slut, what?
9853592	9854113	Ha ha.
9855939	9856960	Oh, here you go again.
9857320	9858981	Fucking cappin' on Paul Terry.
9859261	9863984	One of the most... She is the most... the most... Wait, no, no, no, no.
9864284	9866906	She's the most talented musician in the world.
9867727	9868087	Ever.
9869908	9871569	Yeah, too bad she's Naoki.
9873010	9874691	Is this before or after she gave you a blowjob?
9875932	9880575	She may be the most talented musician in the world, but she's not talented at music.
9880935	9882116	She's talented in other ways.
9882156	9883537	She's just also a musician.
9885906	9886553	That may be so.
9888117	9891458	They're having a group orgy, it's Hybroid Ruby, the group orgy, okay?
9891478	9907585	You've got, you know, the DDR All-Stars, which is basically, you know, B4U, you know, all them buck naked, freaking just getting freaky, and then you've got, then you've got Politary in the mix there, and some other chick that we don't remember her name because she doesn't really matter, because they all suck, and then, ew, then Naoki's in there.
9907765	9910667	Oh, screw Naoki, he can be out of, he can be filming.
9910687	9912648	Sorry, I think Jenny Rom's a bigger slut than Politary.
9913088	9915709	We already know that half of B4U is really Naoki, too.
9916994	9919336	Have you heard the new Polytary song where she plays a didgeridoo?
9920236	9921017	Come on, guys!
9921077	9921997	She's Australian!
9922117	9923058	Fucking kill my joke!
9923358	9924759	There's been a sniper shooting!
9928421	9930803	Okay, she stopped doing the didgeridoo sound, that's right.
9934805	9938087	Ah, I like Black Lab's term for Polytary, Austrasian.
9939228	9940049	She's Austrasian.
9951657	9956042	Oh god, they're criticizing me because we've said slut like 20 times and haven't played the thing.
9956082	9961307	Jamie, stop advertising!
9961327	9964310	I thought you needed to be pressed, Rob.
9984883	9985664	All right, that's enough.
9985984	9988507	We hate Paula Terry and we want all her balls to die.
9988967	9995773	I don't know what this chat room is obsessed with my cock and me giving lap dances and me being a slut and like all this other stuff.
10000578	10001519	This is scary.
10001979	10002680	I need the chat room.
10002860	10004101	Why would you call Matt a slut?
10004141	10005062	He's a bigger slut than I am.
10005082	10005843	You said it again.
10014144	10014764	Yeah, I'm sorry, what?
10016945	10019326	Well, he is correct, but that's not the point, okay?
10022848	10024949	I am the biggest slut of them all.
10025789	10026569	Oh, sorry, Rob.
10031552	10032652	All your sluts are belong to us.
10035133	10036554	I'm just gonna do the hotkey here.
10043615	10046958	Hey, hey, they have loose sloths in Reno.
10047639	10048940	Tricked you, almost got you.
10048960	10055346	Thought I was going to say slut, but... They need to change it until you're in my parts.
10059169	10063073	Let's see, in the chat room, they're saying, Matt is not a slut, he's a one-woman man-whore.
10064254	10064734	That's cute.
10066756	10067137	I still...
10068448	10073211	Ah, SoCalKicks suggests Dave is a slut to his hand.
10078654	10079255	Yes, Jamie.
10079415	10080816	He's a slut to the Crisco can.
10091162	10092403	Crisco doesn't work?
10093844	10095065	The hell are you talking about?
10095105	10097206	What would you suggest, being the expert on the show?
10097884	10098404	I don't know, man.
10098805	10099445	Saliva!
10103048	10106752	Okay, here's my opinion on the whole... God, I can't believe we've finally brought this on the show.
10107292	10107853	It's over.
10107913	10110095	Welcome to the last episode of Orange Mountain, everybody.
10110895	10111596	Bomani what?
10111636	10112296	DDR what?
10112757	10113978	Okay, well, let's see here.
10115019	10119222	See, the thing that really sucks about all those freaking loops is they get sticky after a while, okay?
10119703	10120844	That just sucks, okay?
10121304	10123486	Okay, no more masturbation chat.
10124227	10125488	We need Mr. Spanky for this.
10127938	10136922	Okay, you just get two Ziploc bags, you fill them with hot water and you tape them together so they're kind of like a little, you know, and you just... Oh my god, Jameson!
10136942	10137662	What was that, Jamie?
10138382	10139703	That was a C-bomb!
10140503	10140723	Oh!
10140963	10141743	Did Delay get that?
10142824	10144084	I don't know if the mics got it or what.
10144665	10145505	We don't have a Delay.
10145545	10146825	We're shitty radio, remember?
10149967	10151147	That was beautiful, Jamie.
10151487	10152227	That was so awesome.
10153148	10155849	Remember, folks, the FCC does not approve of Orange Lounge Radio.
10158632	10159632	Fuck the FCC.
10159692	10162833	Fuck the FCC with Chrisco's sticky lube.
10165273	10167614	It's all about the Ziploc bags in the water.
10169474	10170054	Sluts.
10170094	10171214	Two Ziploc bags.
10171494	10173314	This sounds like... We have a slut call.
10175735	10179576	And for the record, I said like a big old cut.
10182856	10188037	Okay, we have a suggestion from the chat room that we need to change the topic and we should talk about cake.
10189191	10191332	Frankly, I think cake makes a crappy lube.
10194714	10195774	Frosting, maybe.
10198315	10199976	You can do so many fun things with frosting.
10200596	10201637	There's the butter spray.
10203898	10211521	Of course, I think that we should actually get the tips from the people who actually have cocks.
10213222	10215303	So, cockmasters, speak up.
10217990	10223133	What they really need is to coat your cock in Teflon, okay?
10227495	10228876	Because nothing will stick to it?
10228936	10230017	Is that why they need that?
10230057	10233298	But how do they get Teflon to stick to your dick if nothing sticks to Teflon?
10233478	10234719	Well, how do they do it with pots?
10234859	10236860	Shit, man, how do they do it there?
10237701	10238001	You know what?
10238061	10238741	Okay, okay, okay.
10238821	10241983	Enough cock-stroking chat.
10242303	10243984	You're all a bunch of cockmasters.
10244784	10245485	I resent that.
10246579	10247920	You're not the master of your cock?
10248000	10250943	I want to talk about that Jones soda you had the other day, Rob.
10252964	10253224	Hi.
10254345	10254766	Nice cock.
10254826	10256047	You're the best.
10257608	10257888	Right.
10259009	10260670	Uh-oh.
10260710	10265234	Oh, speaking of which, oh, we went to get the, oh, Irene, you have the biggest cock here in the room right now.
10268056	10270118	What do you like to do with your cock?
10270959	10273100	Well, I mostly like to masturbate.
10273141	10274261	Sometimes I like to pee.
10274442	10275883	With Buck, with Buck Futter?
10276909	10279690	Yes, sure.
10279910	10282551	The day is mine.
10282611	10286012	This show went to the toilet about three hours ago.
10286832	10288872	I think it went about like 40 episodes ago.
10288932	10291233	I have to ask you about the penis micia.
10292973	10293994	Anal bum covers.
10298535	10300716	Maybe they should have like DDR Epcot cam.
10303266	10305190	It sounds like something you have to get, like a surgery.
10305230	10308917	Like, you know how when you get tested for STDs, they sort of, ah, right in the peel.
10310641	10313446	Um, some of us haven't had to.
10314088	10314549	I haven't either.
10314569	10315070	I've heard stories.
10315919	10320380	No, it was so funny, once I was at In-N-Out, and my mom thought, yeah, that was funny!
10321660	10322681	In-N-Out cock, get it?
10323021	10339425	And the person next to us was reading a magazine called Therapist, and the person reading it was obviously some therapist who subscribed to the monthly magazine or whatever, and my mom pointed it out, and she's like, you know that if you put a space between the first three letters, it says The Rapist?
10339965	10342666	And she's just like, oh my god!
10344502	10346844	My mom's like, yeah, you'll never look at that word the same again.
10349306	10351147	Still, you're in those parts.
10352208	10358613	Nostylan is doing his typical interesting random comments here in the chat room, and he says, who wants to go to DDR camp?
10360215	10362116	What the hell would DDR camp be?
10362216	10365299	Is that like a... I don't know.
10365399	10366660	This one time at DDR camp?
10367600	10370503	Okay, that's not... Is that like a camp where they're going to, like, kill us all?
10370543	10371744	This one time at DDR camp?
10372544	10372985	I, um...
10373925	10378567	Who would be the first counselor at DDR camp to try and molest somebody?
10378607	10378767	Loki.
10378787	10380108	Loki has his hand up.
10380128	10381049	I didn't have anything to say.
10381069	10381949	Oh, he was volunteering.
10382469	10385571	Okay, how many DDR players are hard up for dates?
10402046	10402406	All of them.
10403047	10403447	Not me.
10403648	10404348	Only you, not you.
10405029	10405669	Almost all of them.
10407411	10411214	No, I take that back because... All of them that aren't involved with Orange Lounge.
10412055	10415658	I would say that would go towards any females.
10415938	10419761	Obviously, I would not want to molest any guys because that's just weird.
10422484	10424045	Yeah, but this is hypothetical.
10425286	10426607	Hypothetical can't hurt me.
10428129	10429550	Not hypothetical, just pathetic.
10432665	10434712	I'm hyper-pathetical, okay?
10436497	10437400	Hyperglycemic?
10438444	10439066	Telepathetical.
10441368	10447831	EOSFVB expresses great disappointment that we went through that whole segment about masturbating and didn't bring up lotion.
10448411	10453093	And then more than Jake says, it puts the lotion on its skin and puts it in the basket.
10453113	10454794	Well, they didn't really let me finish.
10454834	10456834	They stole the mic from me before I could finish.
10456915	10458935	But yeah, lotion would definitely work.
10460316	10461837	Actually, that's pretty good.
10462117	10464758	It puts the lotion on its skin or it gets the hose again.
10465140	10466601	How about a dead baby joke?
10466641	10468662	More than Jake wants us to tell a dead baby joke.
10469542	10470183	Alright, here it is.
10470263	10472124	How many dead babies does it take to screw in a light bulb?
10472204	10472524	How many?
10472944	10473644	None, they're dead.
10476126	10478347	Alright, well there's one, I'm just going to read this one from the chat room.
10478507	10478827	Wait, I got one.
10478847	10479067	I got one.
10479587	10480648	What is a dead baby?
10481068	10481288	What?
10481789	10482989	A baby that is dead.
10483870	10484530	That's not funny.
10484950	10486151	Why is people laughing?
10486171	10490053	Alright, more than Jake says, what's the difference between a pile of dead babies and a Corvette?
10490973	10491193	What?
10491334	10492734	I don't have a Corvette in the garage.
10492754	10493955	What?
10494721	10495221	That's pretty funny.
10495501	10495781	All right.
10496341	10501463	We're getting about to that time where we're going to end the damn show, so we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10501503	10503764	Let's start with all the guests tonight, starting in the back with Dave.
10504584	10506024	Dave, what's your final thought of the day?
10507565	10508805	Homework sucks.
10509005	10510125	I have school tomorrow.
10510566	10511506	That is bullshit.
10512066	10512786	It's school.
10513346	10515187	Finals are coming.
10516147	10518748	No.
10518768	10518808	No.
10524870	10527472	Okay, I don't quite understand the school system over here.
10527813	10529714	Why would you have finals after a break?
10529934	10533217	See, back where I come from, we have finals before we go and vegetate.
10533577	10534358	Thank you very much.
10534378	10534878	Sorry, sorry.
10534898	10539022	So you can forget everything.
10539442	10541264	Apparently, he's almost gone.
10542905	10544206	Somebody pass the mic, somebody else.
10545187	10546648	Brad, what's your final thought of the day?
10546668	10550231	My final thought is, what do you get when you cross an owl on a bungee cord?
10551092	10551933	My ass!
10553959	10557522	I thought you were going to say cunt, fuck, shit, dick, ass, pussy.
10557763	10558343	Moving on.
10558483	10560125	We haven't gotten to the last part of it.
10560725	10561246	Moving on.
10561326	10561866	Stress up.
10562207	10563088	Your final thought of the day.
10563448	10567071	First of all, I would like to thank everybody for making this such a wonderful weekend.
10567091	10569534	You're welcome.
10569854	10571315	The experience was very fun.
10572016	10576180	And final thought is... Huh?
10578590	10579931	All right, Angel.
10580351	10582312	We need to light Loki's hair on fire.
10583012	10584973	Yes, we need to light Loki's hair on fire.
10585674	10586734	Dress him up as Rage.
10588475	10588795	Jamie.
10590376	10592778	Contribute to the DarkSakura Needs New Shoes Fund.
10593698	10595239	Contribute to the Jamie Needs New Shoes Fund.
10595379	10598280	Actually, people, find me a poppin' music controller.
10599561	10605044	Because I have one more controller to get before I have one, everyone that's been out.
10605364	10606905	At least, you know, except for the arcade ones.
10608700	10609220	Get me one.
10610041	10610882	Bitches.
10612263	10612983	No women, no kids.
10614184	10616186	I was very rude because I cut off Angel before she was done.
10620249	10621410	Best show ever.
10622311	10622871	This was fun.
10623091	10623391	Cool.
10624392	10625413	We have to talk about dick more often.
10625473	10625753	Loki!
10626694	10627695	Your final thought of the day.
10628576	10632519	I don't know this dick that you're talking about, but he gets too much attention.
10633139	10637182	Anyways, um... Huh.
10637763	10638003	I had...
10639619	10641460	Well, my girlfriend's not here, obviously!
10642420	10642980	Jackass!
10644221	10651924	Um, so, yeah, um, I should start a fund and see how many people give me money.
10652785	10653525	That'd be cool.
10654646	10655566	I need to get money.
10657107	10664050	Start the Dave Needs to Get Laid Fund, which all money goes towards me to get laid.
10665010	10665350	Yes.
10666131	10668072	For your 18th birthday, we'll take you to the Buddy Ranch.
10670526	10671046	Fuck that, man.
10671067	10672788	We could take you to the strip club, okay?
10672888	10677652	And most of the chicks there give head when you go into the private dances.
10678033	10678593	So I've heard.
10678733	10685259	I've never actually had it happen, but... Brad's doing the dancer dance.
10686340	10687561	No, you have to have a Barbie doll.
10689242	10689963	Here, use the ferret.
10692921	10693221	All right.
10693661	10694482	Are you done with your final thought?
10694802	10694962	Yes.
10695262	10696103	Do you have a final thought?
10696843	10697464	Oh.
10697904	10699385	My final thought, that's cool.
10699545	10701826	They got RBGL sucks printed really big in the chat.
10701986	10702126	Yes.
10702226	10702927	Word.
10703707	10711232	My final thought is work sucks, Dancer is the best video ever, and, um, yeah.
10712913	10713413	I need a date.
10714213	10716475	Fuck, shit, cock, cunt, slick, dick, suck, suck.
10716555	10717735	Oh, I said slut.
10719496	10720057	Ha, ha.
10720597	10721137	Ha, ha.
10721598	10722118	Give me that.
10722138	10722218	What?
10724514	10725895	I can imitate Popolitary.
10730258	10730579	Okay.
