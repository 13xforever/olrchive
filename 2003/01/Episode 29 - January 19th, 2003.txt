message for you sir! attention! do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex. In this episode...
Hey, are there any balls down there?
That's the biggest berry you've ever seen, Dingleberry.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Showgirls. Absolute frightful. What's yours?
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.
Now's the time when Scrockets pay me dogs!
I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!
I know kung fu.
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
Why did they have to take the word gay?
No! What I expect for Spanish expression is Hindu.
Hey!
Shut up! Where's my gun? This is not a boomstick!
Come on, girls, it's time to drop the bomb.
Look, I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.
What kind of working man would find that funny?
Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live, and this is episode number 29 for January 19th of 2003.
You're tuned into the B-e-e-e-e-mani scene's most drunken radio station of all things b-money.
My name is Rob Roberts, and you may know me as Sky.
Thank you for joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the Happiest
Bunny on the Farm, Ms. Jamie Summers.
That was last week.
You know her better as Dark Seqra?
In that corner, say hello to our Tech Massa Loki.
And with us tonight will be some special guests joining us a little bit later.
There's nobody else here yet.
It's just the three of us, feeling the love.
We don't have a Dave here.
We don't have a Dave here yet, and my drinking partner isn't here yet.
Yes, the rumor...
I can't drink.
The rumors are true, we're going to be doing some drinking on the show tonight,
except unfortunately, Jamie's not going to be able to drink.
I mean, I have no doubt that I'd be able to drink excessive amounts
if it had not affected my ability.
Even so, I'm not a major idiot.
Because I have a neat little thing outside that will prevent me from driving,
which I'll tell anyone about later.
Alright, yeah, we'll talk a little bit more about...
I'm going to Bush.
We'll talk a little bit more about the drinking when we come back for our first break.
Can you play me some Initial D?
I will play you some Initial D music during this break.
We'll also play some Guacamole Del Taco, how's that sound?
Sure.
And some other stuff too.
Any Initial D that I'm talking about may need things.
Any other opening thoughts?
I don't have much.
Alright, we'll be back in a little bit. Enjoy.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
If you feel my heart, what you're feeling is mine, and it means you better stay behind
It's the sense of your soul, that you tried to relieve, never until your heart functions
Feel it, feel it baby, feel the fire, it's coming deep inside me
Listen, listen honey, listen to, come listen to you, listen to the heartbeat
Oh oh oh, you better think you can turn right now
10 to the heartbeat, and let it go
You can fall, let your body flow
10 to the heart beat
Oh oh oh, you better think you can turn right now
10 to the heartbeat, and let it go
Hi Ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
Howdy ho kids, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and as we mentioned last week,
some of us have, well I guess maybe I'm the only one that has a three day weekend this
week. My company celebrates Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, so I don't have to work
So, I'm sorry. Hey, it ain't my fault my company rules. Yours sucks.
Mine feeds us. Mine caters... caters, uh, Chevy's and...
Yeah, you get barbecues. We don't get shit, so shut it, lady.
But, uh, we decided that we would do some
drinking tonight. Except, um, I'm really the only one that's able to drink
because Jamie has to work tomorrow, and...
I'm driving.
You wanna tell everybody your big news?
Okay, first of all, I don't get hangovers, so I could drink.
Alright, alright.
Okay.
I do. I'm a lightweight, as you're going to find out tonight.
You have seen how drunk I have gotten, and I've never had a hangover yet.
I have a car, and it owns all of you. Yay!
It's the seafoam aquamarine blue, cheeky color, 93 Toyota Tercel two-door.
It's a DX. I'm going to have a 2 added before it.
Anyway, it's black inside, and it has a CD player, so I instantly went and burned off CDs of Eurobeat.
But my car is like awesome, but since I drove over here, actually I gave up going to the
con just so I could drive my car.
Because my car made me feel happy.
Jamie got a car!
And because I'm driving tonight, I'm not going to be doing any drinking, however because
we've got three hours, I'm going to do a shot in honor of the night.
We're going to do one shot together.
By then, I will have peed it out or whatever.
Now we have to tell everybody, because we're radio hosts, drink responsibly, we're being
smart in how we're drinking here, the show's done out of the spare bedroom of my house
so I don't have to go anywhere.
Yeah, I'm chasing my suntan oil with Propel.
Jamie's going to be letting it wear off, she's going to do a one-shot, Loki's not drinking
at all, he's going to babysit.
And then Brad and Irene will be here in a little while, and Brad's going to drink too,
and Irene is his driver.
I'm expecting that Rob's going to eventually assault Brad.
Brad and I are the... assault him with what? My CAC?
Yes! Yes!
If you will drink some...
Excuse me while I whip this out.
Anyway, okay, so here we go.
All right, first...
A toast.
And only a shot.
Now, I've never taken Malibu rum just straight up.
I always mix it with something.
I've never had it at all.
This is pretty bad. Okay, here we go.
Dude, that was weak.
Oh.
Very coconutty.
That was it?
Yeah, it was kind of weak, wasn't it?
It was really weak. It was yummy.
It's yummy.
It doesn't burn to me.
It tastes like burning.
It tastes like burning.
I swear, now I know what suntan oil tastes like.
Ugh. God.
Ew.
Ew, that left the nastiest after days.
Yes, please. That left the nastiest after days.
I thought it was okay.
Ooh!
This stuff was weak.
You're about to find out I'm a fucking lightweight, by the way, too.
How many, how many what?
Where's the bottle?
The bottle of what? Malibu?
Malibu yeah over here 21% okay excuse me that tasted like five like drinking a
wine cooler do that this would be really yummy with vanilla coke I bet it would
too let me let's let's do that um I think I got president's day off okay I
don't have president's day off bitch I might be able to take it off we'll see
We'll see.
Alright.
I'll drink with you.
I'm gonna do a floating holiday.
Anyway.
Oh yeah!
Hi!
We're a BamaniTalk radio show, aren't we?
Yeah.
What's new, you guys?
How was your week?
What'd you do this week?
I think my insides are getting a tan.
Your insides are getting a tan?
How?
Yeah, I drink some tannyl.
In your big fluorescent light.
Or whatever.
Kind of just bright light bulbs.
This show is gonna go to hell much faster than ever before.
Did you enjoy playing the new DDR Extreme?
we have a new Extreme Machine here locally? No. No, I was in pain, remember? Oh, that's
right. I'm sorry to hear that. Which is going to be part of my Fuck You of the Week. I'm
sorry to hear that. Loki, tell us about the new machine and the unlock code that ended
up getting released this week. What happened with that? Konami released, or actually, Bomani
Cell said that someone had hacked the code and then later on, about, I don't know, about
five minutes later, someone's like, oh yeah, Konami just faxed in the code, you know, to
germania only course with at least 100 seconds and across the nightmare in it
so that's kind of cool and um other than that we've also been having
we've been having slight problems with the machine lately
and the problems are that machine keeps freezing up during middle songs
max 2 did that same shit though didn't it? where like after you play a certain set of songs
like one of the internet rankings? no this has nothing to do with internet rankings
that was a glitch in the whole thing this has to do with like a smudge on the CD
You'll play a song and all of a sudden, boom, it'll freeze up.
I don't know if it's a smudge on the CD because if that were the case, the music would skip because the music's on the CD.
What happens is the music keeps going and the steps freeze.
Yikes.
So that's a pretty nasty bug there and they're going to be hopefully reinstalling it on Monday and hopefully that'll fix the problem.
I wonder if that's happening at other places or if it's just specific to our local arcade.
JB told me that, it happened to him.
Don't!
So, yeah, I don't know.
Other than that, I got yet another bonus from my company.
Another $800.
Are you going to buy your machine yet?
No, I'm not buying my machine, I'm paying off my credit card.
Paying off my credit card and getting my savings account where it should be.
And so, you know, hopefully, hopefully that will fix things, you know, financially with me and make me financially stable.
I see Slinky saying that our Vigal machine has the same problem. That's not looking good.
Surprise! They have a broken machine.
Well, no, still though, if this is a widespread problem, I mean, defective DDR Extreme copies going out.
Well, gee, Konami being lazy? No. Never.
Remember the issue with the six-town seven-style videos?
Oh, yeah, that's right.
So, that kind of sucks, but it happens every now and then.
It's no big deal.
But other than that, with my money, I went and bought a GameCube.
And with that GameCube, I also got Animal Crossing.
Yay!
Welcome to the crack world addiction.
So now I've joined the cult of Animal Crossing, in my wonderfully named town of Big Cock.
It was my girlfriend's idea, okay? Not mine.
Oh my.
We were thinking of something to name it, and it was funny, so...
We named it Big Cock, and it makes for some really funny dialogue.
If you two have a baby, you know, five years down the road, you gonna name your baby Big Cock?
No.
But, uh, yeah, so that's the name of our town, and it's pretty cool. Pearl's a bitch.
Yeah, she is.
Well, she left our town.
So I don't like her, and, yeah, so that's what I've been playing, playing Animal Crossing.
Oh, and another thing, I found out, I finished testing my DDR Max 2 edit machine code thing.
Apparently the number is not a pattern at all and it's randomly generated so no I'm not gonna test all
16,000 combinations because I would take forever dope and it'd be a waste of my time and it's and it's coming out in April
So what do I give a shit about that? So
But I'm sure that'll be news will ever be giving out later yes
I'm sorry, Jamie
That's when my birthday is and someone can buy me something.
Yes, Max 2 for the Japanese system is coming out April and of course the U.S. version is
coming out around November, so just like...
A little bit delayed.
It's a little late.
Just like DDRUSA.
A late birth.
And you'll hear it here first, this is a few of the tracks that are going to be in there.
Okay.
You've got...
Now how do you know this, Mr. Man?
How do I know this?
Well, because they're done already.
They were going to be in DDR Max USA, but they were like, no, we're going to cut it out and put them in the next one.
So we've got Nemesis, Keep on Lifting, and...
This is a weird name born from 6 style.
Big Black Hawk.
No, it's not Big Black Hawk.
Speed Mix.
M-2 Step.
M-2 Step 101 or something like that.
Alright.
And if they're not in Max 2, then you never heard it here.
Ain't it good.
Ain't it good.
You don't end up in Max 2? You never heard it here. You didn't say anything about it.
Yeah, I didn't say anything.
But Max Japan, I bet you anything Max Japan is going to have that, Max 2 Japan will have that drop the bomb remix as an unlocked track.
And what else? It's going to have, because you know how you can, yes, the Dynamite Rave remix, thank you Jimmy.
Because you know how you can sort the list in Xtreme by game?
You can see that there's the one that's songs from home's versions?
Well, they have like the drop the bomb mix in there and they have the dynamite rave one
in there, but they don't have the true colors mix.
Because it's unlockable.
Oh, is it?
It's unlockable.
Same, dynamite rave's not in there yet either.
That's also unlockable.
Oh, well shit, I'll be damned.
And the only one, do it right, the two-step version is going to be in there.
But since those are all supposedly home version unlocked songs, that would mean they need to be in a Japanese home release, so I bet we'll be seeing those in Max 2 Japan.
Probably, well not necessarily though, because look at AM3P 303 bass mix, that's not in there yet.
But it might, that might be another one! Ah! Ah!
But, you know, I don't know, I hope they release something new instead of all this rehash shit, you know.
Yeah, I want to see some new shit too.
Go to the bathroom.
Gross!
Okay. What's new in the Sim world, Loki, as long as we're talking to you
at the start of this show here?
Well, other than my site coming up next week,
I know it was supposed to be this week, but we ran into script issues with their...
Yeah, right. You were playing Animal Crossing all week.
No, I wasn't. So, we ran into problems with that, and it should be coming up next week.
Although, I don't know. I'm debating, because our tech people at work
work or going through all of our computers and deleting all non third-party stuff. And
I have all my stuff hidden but he hasn't quite gotten to my computer yet. So I have to wait
for him to come by and like supposedly delete everything so I can reinstall everything and
then get back to what I was doing. But I have to wait for that to happen before I can, you
know, I don't know, I could probably upload everything right away but they're just being
super anal because our HR department thinks for some reason that background screen savers
and like other stuff like that cause viruses because they're dumbasses and don't know shit
about computers.
So yeah, hopefully everything should be coming up.
The site's already sort of up right now.
I mean, you can email me to get your account set up so you can upload shit, but it's going
to be www.willddrforfood.net slash leachfromloki.
So definitely go check that out.
Other than that, you've got Bomani Cell keeps releasing more DDR Extreme stuff, although
they're being kind of anal about it, much like last week.
Recently they released the MP3s for Dance Dance Revolution and Paranoia Survivor Max,
which you'll probably hear later on the show.
Other than that, also check out Bomani Sims.
You'll see a lot of stuff that, you know, other people are releasing on there if you've
missed it on, you know, say DDR Mania X, which is also down right now, but the forums are
still working.
DDR East Coast Invasion, I haven't looked at today. I don't think anything is going on there, and that's pretty much it. Not too much.
But yeah.
While Loki was telling us about what's going on in the Bimani world...
I was about to do a shot of this stuff that looks like wall touching.
Jamie was sitting there going, I'm hot.
And she wasn't talking about, you know, just like, oh damn, you know, I got it, I'm sexy,
I'm too sexy for this show.
And I was feeling her face.
She was, she is indeed a little hot from that shot, so.
I always get warm with my fresh...
Put the thermometer against your face and see what you measure.
This one?
Yeah.
I feel retarded.
You look retarded, it's okay.
Here, oh, but it feels nice because I'm hot and then it's cold.
God damn it, Rob, these things burn at a thousand degrees. I feel like burning heat.
While she's doing that, I'm going to take a shot. I'm going to do my next shot here.
Hot damn.
This is some hot damn.
So, cheers. I'm going to toast Loki's water here.
Well, oh wait, it looks like a wall tussin.
Oh!
Ha ha ha ha!
Woo! Right now, I'm currently pointing and laughing at Rob.
Oh, wow!
He sounds like a woman.
Shut up!
Now you sound like you're thirteen.
It tastes like twenty cinnamon Jolly Ranchers all at once.
Ewww.
That other thing looks like butter.
Like butter.
Butter.
Crack, crack, butter.
I shouldn't be drinking so much until Brad and Irene get here.
Oh well.
You guys are going to have to carry this show once I pass out.
So enjoy.
No, I should make a run to Walgreens and get you stuff.
You've been drinking young lady, you can't drive.
I'll go in an hour.
You'll go in an hour.
Make Brad and Irene go when they get here before they start drinking.
Yeah, I want another two liter of Pepsi and a bag of pretzels so I can get sick again.
I'll make them get maraschino cherries.
And we'll soak them in the Malibu.
You know what sucks is when I get really drunk I start making out with everybody, but y'all are prudes.
So...
No, I think it's that we're both taken.
That too.
No, I know of it. You should have seen this one New Year's party I went to.
I got to see Rob make out with a girl.
Shut up.
Ewww.
This is going to be funny because we're going to get lots of blackmail material on Rob.
No you're not. I'm going to delete this episode. It's never going to air again.
It'll be the long lost episode. It's going the way of the tape that scanned
episode.
That's alright.
We know that's...
How hot is your face?
How...
Let's see.
Jamie measures in at...
Oh!
She's off the scale!
She's off 86.
86 is as high as it goes.
She's hotter than that.
I think you need to get her thermometer.
That makes sense, but you know.
This one works better.
Okay.
Oh!
She put it down her cleavage.
This one sucks.
Anyway.
You're getting sakura boopie action on this show.
I didn't show my boobs, hello.
You haven't drunk enough yet.
And I'm not gonna.
Okay yeah, um, what else can we talk about that's Bimani related?
Well let's see, I gotta kinda cover the, carry the show here.
Just remember the Shaft Live coverage you had to do all by yourself.
I know, that's awful.
Anyways, here's the big stuff that's coming up that happened.
They're starting now testing for Guitar Freaks 9 and Drummania 8.
Wow, it's the same goddamn game with new numbers.
But it's got the cool little thingy with the cards that no one's ever going to get.
A neat font.
Yeah, it's purty looking, and they changed the names to GF and DM.
No, no, no, no, it needs to be Gitadora, like 4th and 3rd.
You know what though?
At AI, they have the power-up versions, they're supposed to have the neat little initial do
you want to be card things, and they don't have them at AI.
I know, I was sad.
That made me sad.
Oh yeah, I know, and I've talked about this like three weeks in a row.
Brian's out, he'll hold the door, Jamie.
I know, I didn't get another card.
I know, I need another card to mate with my derby owner's cards.
Okay, my thing is full, and I can't...
Someone, one of our Bay Area listeners, buy me one of those card binders for my horses,
and I'll think kindly of you.
Um, see other stuff in the world since I gotta kinda stretch this out, whatever it is.
Okay, wait, I wanna know something about Guitar Freak's knife and drum idiot.
There's a song in there called I'm a Loser.
Is that the Beatles song?
Fuck, it's probably not.
I'm a loser.
Nah, I don't think so.
I'm a loser.
What's that?
From the concert I went to last night.
Oh yeah, how was the concert?
Jamie, tell us about the concert you went to last night.
It was so fucking hot.
You gotta tell the listening audience what that was.
Okay, I went to a show at the Crest last night, which started off with Honey Spot, which
was pretty cool.
The lead singer was Spaz, and then the Lil' Nots, and they were awesome.
them. And then Ghost of the Robot, which is, I don't know if anyone's Buffy fans out there,
but it's the band that James Marsters has. And that was a really good show. He was, of
course, really sexy. And everybody decided to go up front. And I'm like, fuck going up
front, because you know what? I ate eight, like, ten penguins. So I was going through
caffeine shock at the time and decided to sit there where I was. I got up this morning,
I was going to go to the convention to see him, but that started at 4.10. And I had to
to be here at five, okay? So I wasn't going to have time to enjoy myself in the dealer's
room, I didn't want to deal with that. So, um, I skipped out on that, sold my ticket
to my friend Krista, went out for breakfast. How much were tickets to the sci-fi convention?
Twenty-five a day. Dang. And I don't want to give- But it was supposed to have Captain
Janeway of the Starship Voyager, I'm Captain Janeway, warp drive! No. But, you know, it
it was just, it was just, uh-uh. I decided against it. So how about Dijinci instead?
Captain Janeway should have been, like, ejected into space right when the show started.
No, you can't eject Captain Janeway into space!
She was a cool captain, but she did not have the Picard factor.
What are you talking about? She's, like, she could have been bald and manlier, and she
just needed to be bald and she would have had it down.
It was Picard in a fucking wig. That's what it was.
No. She was cool.
I can't believe we're actually talking Star Trek on this show. I mean, if we weren't like the biggest dorks on the planet already, I think that just brought our show to an all-time new low.
Now, Picard and Janeway had a baby. What would that look like?
It'd be Jengard, or something like that.
Pick way.
Pick your nose.
Isn't that a store?
Picking way?
I don't know.
I'm looking way.
Okay, I'm going to do another shot.
How's that sound?
Too buttery.
That's too late.
I already poured me a shot of hot damn.
We're going to do another.
Pour some butter stuff in it.
I'm not going to mix.
That's going to be nasty.
Like hot butter.
Hot buttery nipple sex.
Hold on.
Lovely.
Okay.
Here's another shot of hot damn.
Make it slurpy.
Make it slurpy?
Make it slurpy.
good radio
oh my
I wanna smell the better stuff
oh that shit is nasty, fuck
you slurped it
my mouth's on fire
his mouth's on fire
Hee hee.
Oh God, this is good.
So…
Does it smell like Werther's or good too?
I'm trying to push the show along.
Yeah.
It does smell like Werther's.
Aren't they good, man?
Do they smell good?
It smells like Werther's.
It's… it…
Oh.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
No.
The Butterscotch stuff tastes like candy.
It tastes like liquid candy things.
so check the proof on hot damn I think it's a hundred it says hot damn 100 yeah
it's a hundred proof no and I I cannot hold liquor for shit you're not supposed
to be drinking anymore all right fine
Jamie's got to call a taxi I want some of this stuff this stuff says yummy you
like candy. I can't believe you've never had butterscotch snaps.
So other stuff in the bimani world. There are some tournaments coming up. I want
to talk about tournaments. Oh good, because I don't know jack about these.
We need to be playing FEMA Flowjack Mr. Junk Remix.
Do we even have that? Was it on one of your pre-shows? I think I do. Okay, I want to talk
about upcoming tournaments, because at least in the Bay Area, and I apologize because I
I know this is a national show, but I don't know much about what's going on on the East
Coast.
If you want to send me private messages, if you want to plug a tournament, send me a private
message, I'll plug it for you in the chat room.
If you aren't in the chat room, just visit our webpage, orangelounge.skie.cx.
It's just that simple.
Anyway, upcoming tournaments.
January 31st is Miggle Extreme at Milpitas Golf Land.
It's going to be a perfect attack and improv freestyle, and I actually am going to have
a half day off work, so I'm going to go. That'll be fun.
Now are you going to enter PA just for the hell of it?
I don't think so, because this is the problem. See, now since I placed fourth at the last
one, and I guess, you know, as they're saying, I upset people and da da da, you know, all
that stuff, there's too much pressure! Like, now I'm expected to enter again, and I don't
want that pressure. I'm going to quit while I'm ahead, I think. I'm going to be a lazy
bum. I'm going to retire. I'm going to do that. I'm going to retire from DDR, and like
in a month i'll come back i'll say all right i fell in love with the game again
because everybody does that
cut the bullshit
just fuck their world up
we'll see we'll see about time somebody else
got in the top category
the first place should not go to an asian
why not are you a racist sir
no yes no i'm just kidding
i want to get really good at perfect attack
so i can win
Do that, girl!
I'm going to memorize all the songs on stealth and make them play them on stealth, and then
I'll wait.
Okay, no, I'm not going to.
Okay, um, shit, what else?
What other tournaments can I...
Oh, Cyber Zone.
Cyber Zone.
And these guys, these guys have some big balls over there because they have this whole commercial
that they're doing now.
They have this whole, like...
Commercial?
Yeah, they put it on the web.
I wish I'd saved it.
I deleted the damn thing after watching it once.
They put a commercial up online that's, like, got all these...
And this is a weird thing.
It's just all these video clips of random DDR freestyles, and it has the AAA dude from
Japan getting the AAA on Max 300 video as a part of it, which has nothing to do with
what they're going to be doing.
But it's cool.
I mean, it's cool that they've got the, I don't know what you'd call it, the ego to
be doing something like that, a commercial.
But that's going to be like a two, three day tournament, and that's in LA in a couple weeks.
And Jamie's mad at them.
Why are you mad at them, Jamie?
part of my fuck you in a week.
Oh, it's going to be part of your fuck you in a week?
Okay.
We'll move back to that later then.
But I'm going to be trying to go to cyber zone, so yeah.
Let's check my private messages because I think we're going to be having some messages
about-
He's already uncoordinated.
This is funny.
Oh my God.
Look, it's sticky.
My desk is sticky.
That's awful.
Okay, that's personal issues, man.
No.
Not that, you perverts.
Gross.
Perverts!
Gross.
I'll tell you what, we'll just get you some wet naps about your monitor.
Muhymer says the East has no tournaments and no machines and they suck.
Just go look on DDR Freeco in the tournament section.
Can we talk about the possibility of Shaft 2?
No, because it's a long ways away.
That's like next November, hello?
Ah, back to basics, February 8th at American Comics.
It's a fourth plus tree, oh, old school.
on

You dropped the bomb on my tongue.
God dammit, play my song.

This is fucked up.
Okay.
Um, first fuck you of the week goes to Rob for having tomorrow off.
Fuck you, bitch!
Bitch, don't make me cut you.
I will. Come over there and beat your ass, woman.
I'd be kicking your ass so hot you'd be tasting rubber in the morning.
I'm gonna kick your ass right back to the kitchen.
Okay. What the fuck ever. Anyway. Yes, my work doesn't believe in racial equality. So, they did not celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. I don't know. I think they just want us all to work a lot.
Also, fuck the faceplate on my CD player.
I thought it was going to be responsible to take my faceplate off.
I put the thing back on and now the buttons aren't lined up.
And whenever I go over a bump or something, the faceplate will get malaligned or something.
And then I have to hit my CD player to get the faceplate back on and then unpause it.
Because it will hit the pause button and then turn down the volume all the way.
Because it's in the faceplate.
Like, fuck that brand. What is it? It's what you have, Rob.
It's just Jensen.
What is it? What? Come on.
I need a toothpick. Fuck your back.
Sorry, everyone. God is shit still in here anyway.
You verped on it.
LOSING MY VOICE
They had a sign on their door that said we're closed due to maintenance and there were fucking people in there.
The fucks.
So we go to teach our Fridays because they have that late night weekend feel.
They were closed.
Ditches.
Rock's about to bring more candy.
Um.
Fucks not having my animal crossing town for two weeks.
But Dan's going to go retrieve it for me.
For me to think very nice. Thank you to Pini for keeping our village happy.
Although I probably have cockroaches living under my bonfire.
Yes, because my house is a shrine to fire.
Fuck.
I'm not wanting to go to the convention today and miss me since he's my man.
But hey, I got plenty of bucks back, so it's cool.
Waffle Square was really nice, but fuck them putting butter on my English muffins.
to take it back. And, um, buck my shoes. Again. My new Vans are really awesome and comfy,
but they like slip loose on my heel and then the tongue is one of those super thick cushy
ones. And now, um, um, I think. This is fucked up. Yes, I needed that. Okay. Um, so I had
to go get cross trainer shoes or I had to get some of his kickboxing shoes to work at
Yeah, I was on the exercise bike, and my feet went numb. Here's my shoes.
Um, let's see. Another fuck you goes to, um, me, for only being able to last 12 minutes on the elliptical trainer, but I'm building up to it.
It also, uh, another fuck you goes to me for stepping from the hot seating gym to go into the freezing cold outside, get the microphone out of the crotch, okay?
Sorry.
I'm talking to you and I've got the microphone right now, we're live.
You're heading over right now?
Okay, I've been holding the speaker up to say something to the listeners.
They can't hear that.
They can't hear you. Unfortunately, because I don't have the phone that has like 20 million decibels or something.
So, head on over. We're doing fuck yous right now. We're doing the fuck yous of the week right now.
Great radio right here.
Alright, we'll save one for you, okay?
Alright, come on over, we're all getting drunk, or we'll rob this.

Yeah.
Um, I was still doing-
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I paused that for your phone call, go ahead.
Okay, well, I, I would have to say fuck you to my boys, except I think that right now
my voice is really fucking cool except I can't like sing in the car with my new CD player
and it sucks because I like holding I hate people being off the beat and I try my hardest
to stay on the beat and it hurts my musicians pride it makes me have a sniff and it's like
that person who I got a picture of the car like mine from for not allowing remote leaving
Fuck you. Yeah.
Um, yeah.
Sorry.
I think I'm gonna pass away.
Okay, Logie's turn.
No one thinks I always have, like, a lot of things to talk to me about.
Actually, I'm kinda tired right now and not very angsty, but I have a couple things to do.
Um, first one goes to Lustketchup.
You unoriginal bitches need to get your own song and own dance steps. Stop ripping off of other people.
I know that dance. It's the hand jive. It was back in the 60s or 50s, whenever the fuck it was.
It was in the... whatever! It was in the fucking...
Yeah, but the dance... the whole movie took place back in the 50s or 60s, so there.
Anyways, so, the whole dance is the stupid hand jive.
And your stupid song, you know, Rapper's Delight, yeah, we know it.
So you butchered it with stupid, you know, Spanish lyrics.
You know, you can go fuck yourselves, and go process yourselves like every other failing artist out there.
So, uh, bye.
The second nephew goes to the freakin DDR3 machine for freezing up
Konami seriously, you need to make something that works right the first time something that's not messed up any sort of way

many distractions. Oh, there's peer pressure. No freaking, um, I don't know. I don't really

It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
Um, Rob's fucked up.

I'm drunk as shit.
Yeah, Guacamole del Tango. That's not what we usually do on this show, although we
We could, except I usually work Mondays, but not this Monday, because Martin Luther King

Okay, here's a quick recap.
Rob thinks he's not drunk enough.

I know.
And this is actually being released probably in, it's released on the 22nd of this year
of January, and then we've also got a few other compilations coming out, Dance Mania
Bass, Hypervest, Dance Mania Speed, Supervest, and Dance Mania Disco Groove, all being released
on March 19th of this year.
Happy for them.
us more stuff. I want the disco one. I want the disco CD. Somebody get that for me, okay?
Because that's like right before my birthday.
Jamie, tell us about that disco special that was on ABC.
Okay, I was at the gym and I was bored so I got on the net bike. And, by the way, I
didn't crash it this time. I was on the net pulse bike and there was this disco special
on ABC. It was like disco house party or something, but it was hosted by Whoopi Goldberg. And
And Paula Abdul was on it.
But it was like, yeah Paula Abdul was on that.
Oh, it's Brad.
Never mind.
No, Paula Abdul.
Oh, it's Brad.
Oh, it's Brad.
But no, it was a pretty neat special, but I was only on the bike for 30 minutes.
Stop it.
I was on the thing for 30 minutes because I was doing my warm up.
Yeah, because I go to the gym now.
Chili's.
Yeah, anyway.
yet anyway uh...
it was pretty cool because they played It's Raining Men
and like it was Whoopi Goldberg singing with this other, I think the lady who originally did it
I don't remember who it was
and then all these guys came down, it was Gloria Gaynor
Gloria Gaynor did I Will Strive
yeah I know
but um
dude they had um
what was her name, Nicki French
was that her name?
you can tell her low eclipse of the heart
Yeah, they had her come and sing Total Clips of the Heart, but it was all sped up and disco-y.
And then, they had Usher doing, oh God, what's that song, but it was really cool, because
when he was out there singing it, he was wearing the little cap, and he was wearing Heelys
and spinning around in it, and then they had all these people dancing on roller skates.
Please tell me Usher did Dancing Queen.
That would be hilarious.
No, but they did, but a bunch of drag queens did Dancing Queen.
That was fabulous.
No, uh, but, um, what was the song that Usher did?
It was, um, Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now.
I think that was it, but it was really cool.
And I normally, I don't like hearing him sing, but he did that song justice.
So it was cool.
And it was just kind of neat watching everybody dance in roller
skates cause I had his Xanadu moment.
Wow.
Everyone's cleared out of the studio.
Hey, there's a really weird stench in this area here.
I mean, it's the stench of Drunk Rob.
Yeah, that is my shoes.
Sorry.
I gotta get used to that man, I'm forgetting the part of it.
Well next week is not a drunk week, I'm sorry.
I don't think I can make it though, tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Oh man, I don't want to go to work tomorrow.
Freaking A, they suck. They don't give me anything to do at work, and I get all my work done, including all the busy work that I make for myself.
And then they're like, oh sorry, you can't go and play on the internet.
Okay, well what the hell am I supposed to do, stare at the wall?
So that's what I've been doing for the last three days, is staring at the fucking wall.
So, yeah.
I have the best thing ever we have I can't say who it is but are one of our
favorite people will take the cock but I didn't say you Rob left the show okay it
looks like it's just you're our official chair it's my chair no I quit to make
room for jahi because shahi owns all and he's the new lord of the universe
You're fired.
I have the chair.
I have some information about Jahi.
Yesterday...
Uh, yeah.
Rob remembers this.
I saw Jahi in his skivvies, but we're not supposed to talk about that.
Uh...
We don't want to spread too many rumors here.
What's it say?
Don't say who, don't say who.
Somebody wants to take the cock.
They will remain nameless.
Rob, you should go find some boobs.
Hey, Rob needs some boobs.
Rob's got boobs.
Dude, Brad, your shadow is fucking awesome.
I look like Chrono.
That's cool.
Touch your boobs.
I can't touch them.

Broken down and smelly and I wasn't ever gonna rank on it on a non-stop ever again, but I ranked. What's up?
Rob is an angry drunk.

Wait
Dude, they just shooting star. I'll give you a cage match
Here's your cage match. Okay cage match time
Rob seems to be somewhat sober enough that he can take the chair again. So Rob, I give you back your chair.
Kage match it's the drunken cage matches but I still haven't even picked my song
for this week however last week in the big fat bloated cage match we had the
winner was Aphex Twin doing a song called eat him up no it's not called eat
him up it's called power pill haha I was gonna say just like just like Tina's
pussy eat it up I'm gonna get beat up for that
Yum?
I'm going to go ahead and do a handstand, handstand, handstand, handstand, handstand.
Alright, that was last week's winner, AFX Twin, with a song called Power Pill.
And you can vote for that, or you can vote for one of the new entries into the cage match
this week.
This is the first one.
Loki, tell us about it.
This is a Yumi Hamasaki with my favorite.
This song right here got me into Yumi again.
A Yumi AGAIN?
Yes, a Yumi AGAIN!
This is my favorite track and verse.
It's M, Above and Beyond.
Alright, you can vote for this.
This is Yumi Osaki with M, Above and Beyond.
ORANGELOGIC AGMATCH!
Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
I'm starting to get a little bit of my coherency back after drinking so much this show.
Should I have a new shot?
Yeah, I think I need another new shot.
No.
Okay, that was-
Yumi Hamasaki with M, the above and beyond mix. What did you think of that, Jamie?
That was pretty cool. I give it an 8.
8. Brad, what did you think of Yumi Hamasaki with M?
Out of a scale of 10?
Yes.
I give it an 8. I think Connect is better.
Alright. Loki?
I give it a 9 because I like all of her stuff and I can't judge you on which is the best.
Alright, Explicit.
Haha! 8.5.
Any reason?
I don't know, I like Connected better, but this one's pretty good. I like it very well.
Orange Blonde Radio's cage match.
Take my thoughts with you and when you look behind
You will surely see a face that you recognise
You're not alone, I'll wait till the end of time
Open your mind, surely it's plain to see
You're not alone
I wait till the end of time for you
Open your mind
Surely it's time to be with me
It is the distance
That makes life a little hard
Two minds that once were close
Not so many miles apart
I will not falter though
I'll hold on till you're home
Take it back where you belong
And see how our lovers grow
You're not alone I'll wait till the end of time
Open your mind Surely it's plain to see
You're not alone I'll wait till the end of time for you
Open your mind
Surely there's time to be with me
You're not alone, I'll wait till the end of time
Open your mind, surely it's plain to see
You're not alone, I'll wait till the end of time for you
Open your mind
Surely there's time to be with me
You're not alone
I'll wait till the end of time
Open your mind
Baby there's time to be with me
You're not alone
I'll wait till the end of time
Open your mind
Open your mind
Sure it is time to be real
You're not alone
You're not alone
Wait till the end of time with you
Open your mind
Open your mind
It ain't the time for me and you
I think I don't know. Anyway, what'd you guys think about you give that a nine? All right, Jamie
All right, cool what you who else is back there I can't see Jonas what you think of that
I give it a nine. I like it. I like it very much
Our chat room doesn't seem to like it. It's weird. We all seem to like it if the chat room doesn't
I like it. I don't really like things like that.
I liked it too.
I give it a 10. It ruled. And if you don't like it, you can kiss my fat ass.
Okay, send your votes over a private message
in the chat room. And you can
vote for either the power pill song
the above and beyond mix, or you can vote for Olive with You Are Not Alone. Send those
votes over a private message to me, Sky, in the chat room right now and we'll tally those
up and read them for you towards the end of the show. In the meantime, we're preparing
for a listless really fast. The topic tonight, Jamie, tell us about tonight's topic for listless.
I need to name my car, and I don't know what to name it. The only thing I'm really going
to do to the outside of it is put the little i right next to the dx on the back of my car
so I can be 2dx. So basically the way that you play listless is each of us lists our
our top three picks, then everybody votes one off the island.
I've been drinking a little bit, shut up, more like a lot, don't touch me, you're violating
me, oh my God, my titty, okay, alright, we're going to take a really quick break, we're
going to take a two minute break with a song from 2DX8 style and we'll be right back with
tonight's list list things we're gonna name jamie's car
Let's reveal tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge
cage match, shall we? It was very, very close tonight. It was one vote separated, the winner
in the second place. But tonight's winner, ladies and gentlemen, you are all such whores
for a Yumi Hamasaki, ladies and gentlemen. M wins by one vote. Pac-Man was in second
place, one vote behind, and Olive was two votes behind. Very close, very close. You
guys were very close match tonight. But that means you get to put in a new song next week,
Oh, yay.
Make me think.
Alright.
So, I am.
We'll be going into rotation on the Orange Lounge normal show.
The thingy.
Anyway, let's do tonight's list list!
Yay!
Although I'm not even done with my list yet.
I was still trying to look up some names here.
Um...
Yeah, okay.
Rob's thinking.
I got it.
It's been a while.
You know.
You're supposed to pick three.
Do you have three?
Does everybody have three?
I think the little gears in his brain...
Jonas is still working, then.
The gears in his brain are well greased, but there's no electricity going to them.
That's right. Keep talking, I gotta close some of these windows.
Words! Talking! I like to talk. Um, what?
Is that why I'm smelling steam in the front room? Is that why I'm smelling steam in the front room, because Rob is stinking?
That's exactly it, but I thought it said he sounded like he's stinking.
Kiss my black ass, you guys.
Robbie stink. I don't stink. You'll have a black ass when I'm done.
Rob, you don't have a black ass. I'm sorry to inform you of this.
Rob. You smell like roses. No, no, no, no. Rob will have a black ass
after I'm done kicking it. Can I help? Yeah. Woo hoo! Let's do that right now on the air.
Rob, bend over. Bend over, bitch.
Oh yeah. I can't feel shit.
Aw, baby. Come on, bitch. Bring it on.
Hold on.

Max cubed is coming off the list, I'm sorry to hear it.
Alright, my pick for coming off the list, I'm sorry to whack Jonas twice in a row,
but buzz isn't really something that I don't think Jamie would want to name her car, so
I have to take buzz off the list. So, we're left with a tiny little list here.
I know what my pick is. And these are your choices, ladies and gentlemen.
Just because Jamie doesn't have to go with what you guys say, but you can send me your
votes. This is the unofficial secondary nickname.

My Baby Mama, Vic Viper, Green Blaze, Propel, Lord Rickman, The Alan Rickman Sex Machine,

Cockmaster.
Those are your choices.
You can send me your votes live right now in the chat room.
Just so the Asian Harry Potter knows, Buzz was taken off the list by me.
Sorry.
What did he say?
He voted for Buzz, but he can't vote for Buzz because I took Buzz off the list.
Ha. Suck me. Alright. I'm not naming my car suck me. No, you can't stress it, you can
vote for Propel. It was, it was, it was vetoed to take off the list. Are you shooting things

oh my god
That last shot that I made for Rob was Malibu and Midori.
And Midori.
You are going to have a serious hangover, my friend.
Too much liquor.
What do you think about that?
Be money-related.
Ah, hold on, I'm queuing something up here.
That wasn't what I asked you.
Shut the fuck up, bitch.
Aw, you didn't.
Aw, no.
Oh, no.
Think about Drunk Drunk Revolution, Drunk Mania, Drunk Drunk Paradise, Drunk Drunk Pre-
Oh my god.
Key Drunk Mania or whatever.
Key Drunk Mania.
Think of the possibility that Trump would do-
Drunk Drunk Reggae? Is that what he said, Matt?
Drunk Drunk Reggae from Jamaica.
Max Drunk.
Actually, that's more like, probably high, and like, smoking all that reefer.
Right now you guys I totally feel like I'm at a rave oh
Yeah, I'm so fucked up right now. Oh
God give me a hug give me a hug. Oh
You my bro
Jamie yeah, I need a hug. What's up, DJ?
Excuse me, but I thought the word of the night was porn.
I wanted to rave, baby.
You're already raving.
I'll do it all night.
Do it with me.
Oh, yeah, pornography.
Something I will not be experiencing for a long time.
Wah, I cry.
No, I thought you were supposed to let
me know where I can get my man porn from.
I'm going to talk about porn about church.
Someone's talking all about porn.
Speaking of porn, when I went to church earlier today,
The priest was all talking about porn!
What was the priest...
What was the priest saying about porn?
How some of us were staring at the
internet, looking at porn.
How some of us were
looking at sexual desires of people in raves, parades, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
How he's all talking about porn in front of the little kid. And how he likes it.
I'm not sure if priests actually do porn, but...
It's getting hot in here, so take off all your clothes.
Oh, those pastors, those preachers, man.
Yeah, masturbation on the holy cross, oh my god.
What?
On the wish cup.
That's blasphemy. No, go to that site with the cross-shaped vibrator.
What? The Jesus suppository? No, they have
vibrators, dildos, one of them is the shape of the cross.
And the other one is Jesus and the other one is Mary.
Can we talk about Mormonism with Brad? I'll tell you all you need to know.
Matt is worried about hearing
the words Sky and Loki. Hey, Brad, what do Mormons think of gays?
We think you're great. And the reason why
It's because it leaves more women to have wives with, so we can have multiple wives.
There's more free women, because of all you fags.
What about lesbians? Lesbians? Well, that's not so good, because then there's less women to have the multiple wives with.
Okay. What do Mormons think of DDR?
Mormons created DDR. This is what you don't understand. Have you heard of the Illuminati?
When I die and have my own planet, will I have DDR all over my planet if I'm a Mormon?
You know, when I die, I always wanted to leave elaborate instructions of what to do with my body, so elaborate that they wouldn't be able to be done.
I want my ashes spread throughout the ventilation system of a major high-rise building.
Let me tell you something about Mormonism.
Wait, Brad, this is what I want to know about when it comes to Mormons. Tell us about the magical underwear.
Oh, the magical drawls?
I don't know anything about them.
Come on, tell us about the magical underwear.
That's classified information.
If you were to see me in my magical underwear, you would burn.
What happens if you get skid marks in your magical underwear, do you go to hell?
No, you have to take them to the Christian dry cleaning center, and they take care of that action.
So, I know this is going to be so freaking dorky, but the movie Chicago, pretty good movie, they had a reference to Mormonism in there that was pretty damn funny. So everybody should go see that movie.
You guys should just go see that movie because it really kicks ass and there's a scene when they're doing a press conference and then they cut to the scene and it's just really awesome.
awesome. The choreograph, the makeup, everything about it. I still think that Dan has the best
Mormon joke ever. The mighty Mormon Power Rangers.
You know, I hate the film industry and their horrible attempts at sequels. For instance,
they're making a sequel to Beetlejuice that's going to be Beetlejuice, trapped in some sort
of netherworld place, and he meets up with the urban version of himself, possibly played
by John Leguizamo or Chris Rock.
Michael Keaton.
Wait, you mean like the Black Beetlejuice?
Yes, exactly.
You know what?
Chicago isn't a sequel to anything, it's just a remake of a Broadway musical.
And all the main actors, Richard Gerecatherines, Seta Jones, and Renee Zellweger, all do their
own singing and dancing, which makes it just even more.
Oh, hey!
That reminds me, I actually found, because we get brochures from these really small studios
at Mark, because my sort of boss right now, she used to deal with all the small studios
that didn't have a rep, so we got this one, they're advertising for Guys Gone Crazy.
I want!
Yes, and I'm buying you guys Guys Gone Crazy, it's really friggin' cheap, so we're buying
that.
Are they naked?
That and Girls Gone, oh what was it, Girls Gone Triple X Wild.
I want that too.
I want the girls one, but not the guys, because remember, men suck.
I want both of them.
Will we get to see some big black cock?
Maybe.
I don't know.
Did I tell you about the time when I was driving down past the movie theaters and there was
the car that had the wax stuff written on the back shield that said, we're filming for
girls gone wild. Show us your titties. Would you have shown your titties Jamie? No. They
have the logo. They have actual car decals and shit that they can put on there. Are we
done with this current topic? Because I have an idea for what we can do. Good. I'm just
fucking hungry. Let's take questions from the chat room. Yes! Alright, so chat room,
You're going to ask us questions.
Anything you want to ask us in the chat room, and we'll answer them on air.
Anything you want to ask us.
And remember, I'm drunk, so I'm going to be very open right now.
So ask us a question, and we'll answer it.
In the meantime, I'm going to open up the mailbag and see if we have anything while
we're waiting for some questions in the chat room.
Nothing personal.
They can't be about a specific other person.
They can be about one of the three of us, but they can't be about, like, why do we like
or not like so-and-so.
Well, okay, I was, now, the only reason I wanted to go to the Rage-
Oh, wow, I'm getting a ton of stuff over private message, hold on.
I'm sorry.
I was going to go to the Rage tonight with Brad and Irene and everybody, but, you know,
because I have work tomorrow, and we would be out till two in the morning, now, I'm okay
with being out that late, but I'm kind of tired right now because I haven't eaten anything
all day, so I'm kind of indecisive. But then again, the last time, if everyone remembers
my story, like last week, I think about the guy trying to proposition me for sex. That
happened on a Sunday night at the Rage, so I could go and get more material for the show.
So it's that whole weighing the situation there, but I don't know. Plus, I might see
See that one? No, that'd be wrong because then I'd be cheating on my girlfriend. No.
Hey, you can always look at the menu.
I'm talking about this one chick that used to go, her name was Nicole, she was the one that's like an ex-stripper, like, has things pierced and that kind of thing.
She used to go to the rage all the time on Sunday nights.
You should just go to faces on that. I'm getting some material for the show.
I'm getting questions from the chatroom. You guys ready?
Yeah, yeah.
Alright, here we go. First question. Should I get some music for...
Perry!

after they're up there with the asian and right there i was easy
at the heart of the exhibit
when also alan skin
and my taxi and he sends a picture of himself i can already tell you the
The answer is no, but let's open the picture just to humor him.
Is Twen sexy?
That's better than the last pic I saw.
Being honest, he's not, I wouldn't say he's sexy, but he's not ugly.
He's got an old navy shirt, that's cute.
He has a chance.
I wouldn't fuck him, but whatever.
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
Everybody stop, stop the show, stop the press, there's an announcement.
Yes.
I copped the cola can.
Can I suck your... Irene, I have a question. Can I suck your dick?
Yeah, sure!
Too late, I already did.
Here we go, moving on.
Moving on, let's answer some more questions from the chatroom.
23magus wants to know, where is Mr. Spanky? Mr. Spanky's on hold this week, because he's not popular.
Mr. Spanky is actually chained up in Rob's closet.
Twin sent us another pic. He must know if he's sexy in this pic.
Is that the same closet that holds his clothes monster in it?
I'd wish.
I don't think too many people are going to see it, because that's a really fucking awesome comic as is, and I don't think they should've made it a movie.
I would see it just from the nerdy thing, but I wouldn't go down and say it.
I would wait until it came to the DVD.
I don't think it's going to be a make-out flick, I think it's going to be a blowjob in the back row movie.
I think it's going to be a vomit flick.
I'm going.
went through the blood talk. Or maybe just checked the theater flick.
Okay, we have another question.
More thanjake543 wants to know, why do my parents cry when I ask them questions?
That's because you scare them.
Yeah, take off the mask when you ask them questions.
Depends on what kind of questions you're asking them. He also wants to know why he's so bored.
Because you're not drunk like the rest of us. Yes, because you're not drunk like the rest of us.

Jamie's calling her man.
The man Dan.
Okay.
Okay, wait, Jamie's going to get waffles?
Yeah, I'm getting waffles.
Are you and Jamie going out for waffles?
Going out for waffles.
Where at?
Probably Denny's because it's the only place I open.
Oh, that sucks.
I want to go out waffles instead of going dancing.
I want to go dancing, but I have to.
I'm on the prowl because I've been single for far too long and it's time for me to get some nookie.
Because it's been, oh my god, when was the last time I got laid?
Not that we want to talk about this on the radio, but I'm drunk, so it's okay.
Shit. Probably since, like, the end of September? That's sad, huh?
Yeah, well, unfortunately, when I go to freakin' The Rage on Sunday nights, I don't know what it is.

alcohol and rubbed it off with his ass. I cleaned it off.
Haha, see you sucker!
Anyways, yeah...
Um, we should, um...
Let's play a two person match game.
Rob spilled blank on his pants.
I guess. Stupid, you gotta say Rob got blank all over his pants.
When Rob was really drunk, he blinked all over his pants.
Chat room, what did you say? What did Rob do to his pants?
I already know what he did to his pants.
But this is a different situation. We're pretending.
Ah, he's back!
I want waffles!
I want waffles too.
Dude, he's like, fisting your ass.
He was fisting your ass.
And you laughed.
Did you like it? How does it feel to be this drunk?
Was out in the living room giving her one because um I want to know what did the chatroom think of the drug show
Should we do this again, or was this a big fat fucking train wreck?
I should be drunk. I don't think we're ever gonna do this again because it's a train wreck this show had no
I mean the show as it is has no organization, but this was like even worse Jamie stop making me drinks
All right one more drink, that's it I need to know what the chatroom thought of this show

What is wrong with you guys?
Oh.
Okay.
What's in this drink, Jamie?
It's the same thing but better.
It's the same thing that they'd write.
Drink it.
I need a minute to re-gather my thoughts.

Stop pressuring me.
Hey, Nino, drink.
Excuse me.
You won't be cool.
Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.
Oh, wait, wait.
Okay.

Oh, Vic Powell wants to know when we're going to get a stripper on the show.
No.
I'm sorry.
No.
Rob.
Rob.
Rob.
I'm sorry.
But no, you too, Harry.
Meanie, I'll get a razor.
We'll get you some Aussie nads.
Some Aussie man, what?
Aussie nads.
I could go for some Aussie, man.
Do you know what Aussie nads are?
No.
Oh wait, nads!
Hair removal!
I just didn't know it was Aussie nads.
I think Stressa wants to come up and get drunk on the next show, too.
Yes, you can come, but only if I can have my way with you.
Just kidding.
I would pay to see that.
Stressa says that if you take a razor to your balls, it hurts.
I wouldn't know, I've never shaved down there.
Wait, did you try to castrate yourself so you'd sound funny?
I know guys that do, but I just-
You kind of really wonder how the porn stars do that.
I mean, I just-
There's some parts of your body-
I would not want to take anything sharp like that down there.
No, there's seriously some parts of your body that you just need to take what God gave you.
I knew a guy when I lived in Alabama who was a stripper.
Who-
Cool.
Was an epilady.
Was he gay?
Huh?
Was he hot?
He was the one I dated.
You dated a gay guy?
and that would get ingrown hairs, because the thing was so shitty.
Could you imagine if you got ingrown hairs on your balls? That would be the worst thing ever.
Yeah.
Um, what was I going to say? I have Jackass the movie. Someone mentioned we should do a Jackass video.
I've got the movie!
Fuck Jackass the movie! Fuck it!
He's like a toy car possessed.
What's the one on your paper now? Is that the fortune cookie?
I think it is.
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?
you better have something good to say. Yeah, that'd be good. In the meantime, we'll start
with the final thoughts while I'm waiting to see what that's gonna be. Jonas, tell us
your final thought of the day. Explicit. Well, I haven't spoken much in the radio. We're
not real radio. We're not real radio, we're in a net radio. Okay, just to say that. Most
of this shows like mainly drunk. Drunk revolution or something like that. With you drinking
I've made out with anybody.
Maybe when I go to the club I'll get to make out with some folks, that'll be fun.
Yeah, I did get to grow boobies, so thank you, James.
Since I can't be on the show Sunday, or next Sunday afterwards, it depends on my schedule
But an explosion, my upcoming school that's just starting right now, is about to start on Tuesday.
Well, I'll probably be there next February.
Alright.
And let's see, thoughts about today.
Alright, dead air.
I need to stop playing Animal Crossing and finish my website so I can get stuff for people to download and save.
Alright, that's cool. I'll accept that.
Yeah, we need strippers on the show. Actually, I need to make a trip over to the strip club because it's been a long time and I was actually reading reviews last night of strip clubs and supposedly at school clubs you get the seemiest lap dances there.
Strippers? I can hire a few strippers.
We need to do Orange Lounge Live from the strip club.
Wait until I'm not here.
I'm sorry, but I would rather see real boobs than fake boobs. I think that real boobs are better.
I'll just get some people with real boobs. I don't even go with the fake.
If I can touch it, it's real enough for me.
It's like that's the story. Your breasts feel so weird because they're real.
I've actually touched real boobs and fake boobs before.
Is there a difference?
Well, the fake boots.
like a little unnaturally firm it's just I don't know it's just not soft it's just
firm silicone difference between a wave less water bed and a regular water bed
I've just had a regular waterbed so I would imagine probably yeah well I haven't
touched a brisk for a while but I hear now though they have the ones that you
You know, they do feel natural. I've never felt that way.
Bluesaunt?
I'm never going to have a need for any type of enhancements, so I have to ask these questions. I'll never find out on my own.
Yes, just stay natural.
Well, my girlfriend, she's still got, like, you know, issues with her self-image, where she thinks she's...
She says she wants to get her boobs done, but I was like, no, you don't need them.
Why? What's wrong with her boobs?
If she put on 10 pounds, she'd gain more boobs.
What's wrong with the boobs?
She doesn't want to do that. She wants to be thin with bigger breasts.
I'm saying she doesn't need to do that, but she wants to.
Go ahead. I'm not going to stop her.
You know, actually, from my experience working at GNC and everything,
there are actually some herbs that you can take that increase your hormones and increase your breast size.
We all know about that.
She's taking enough drugs as it is right now.
It's all natural.
We're running long, so I just need to get everybody's final thought.
Are you doing any final thought, Logie?
Yes.
Jamie?
Um...
Bye.
My final thought is I'm drunk as fuck, and we're not going to be doing this again for
a long time.
Chubs, you suck.
You were supposed to be here drinking with me, but no, I understand the poor thing, because
I'm poor too.
And uh... that's it for now.
Um, actually, I might get really drunk tonight when I get home, and go live.
Until 2am.
Oh, wow.
It's actually the station is gonna be live until well you'll have to you'll have to try and kick me off
I think but I'm gonna be going out. So when I get back though, you can go live. I don't know
All right, anyway, yeah, I think that's it for now
anything else?
Not that I know of, everything's fine
Alright, hope you enjoyed the drunk show boys and girls, that's it, we're signing off

Heed! Paper! Now!
Move that melon of yours and get the paper if you can.
Pulling that gargantuan cranium about.
I'm not kidding, that boy's head's like Sputnik.
Spherical, but quick, point to your pants.
