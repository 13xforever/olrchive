00:00:01,932 --> 00:00:02,813
[SPEAKER_21]: Message for you, son.

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,174
[SPEAKER_22]: Attention!

3
00:00:05,115 --> 00:00:08,997
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

4
00:00:10,618 --> 00:00:15,662
[SPEAKER_27]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

5
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,211
[SPEAKER_27]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

6
00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:25,731
[SPEAKER_27]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

7
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:29,012
[SPEAKER_27]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

8
00:00:29,552 --> 00:00:32,453
[SPEAKER_27]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

9
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:33,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.

10
00:00:33,853 --> 00:00:35,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

11
00:00:35,653 --> 00:00:43,075
[SPEAKER_21]: In this episode... Hey, any balls down there?

12
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,836
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the biggest fairy you ever seen, Tinkle Fairy.

13
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,656
[SPEAKER_21]: What's your favorite scary movie?

14
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:49,674
[SPEAKER_23]: Showgirls.

15
00:00:50,574 --> 00:00:51,735
[SPEAKER_23]: Absolute fright.

16
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:52,776
[SPEAKER_23]: What's yours?

17
00:00:52,796 --> 00:00:55,278
[SPEAKER_23]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

18
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:56,539
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't torture yourself.

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,000
[SPEAKER_23]: That's my job.

20
00:00:58,161 --> 00:00:59,962
[SPEAKER_21]: Now's the time our sprockets bang me dogs!

21
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:03,125
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll get you, my pretty.

22
00:01:03,325 --> 00:01:04,666
[SPEAKER_23]: And your little dog, too.

23
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:05,947
[SPEAKER_23]: I know Kung Fu.

24
00:01:06,347 --> 00:01:08,949
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

25
00:01:08,989 --> 00:01:10,851
[SPEAKER_23]: Why did they have to take the word gang?

26
00:01:12,452 --> 00:01:15,054
[SPEAKER_04]: No one expects a punishing position.

27
00:01:15,355 --> 00:01:16,696
[SPEAKER_04]: It's end of age!

28
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:25,756
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio We are live and this is episode number 29 for January 19th of 2003.

29
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:52,853
[SPEAKER_07]: You're tuned in to the B-Money Scene's most drunken radio station of all things B-Money.

30
00:01:53,453 --> 00:01:54,374
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts.

31
00:01:54,494 --> 00:01:55,494
[SPEAKER_07]: You might know me as Sky.

32
00:01:56,254 --> 00:02:00,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

33
00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:04,656
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that was last week.

34
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:06,897
[SPEAKER_07]: You know her better as DarkSakura.

35
00:02:08,937 --> 00:02:11,118
[SPEAKER_07]: In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

36
00:02:11,938 --> 00:02:12,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

37
00:02:13,986 --> 00:02:17,210
[SPEAKER_07]: And with us tonight will be some special guests joining us a little bit later.

38
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,212
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nobody else here yet.

39
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:19,093
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the three of us.

40
00:02:19,193 --> 00:02:19,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Feelin' the love.

41
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:23,033
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have a Dave yet.

42
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:26,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we don't have a Dave here yet, and my drinking partner isn't here yet.

43
00:02:27,274 --> 00:02:29,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the rumor... I can't drink.

44
00:02:29,094 --> 00:02:29,934
[SPEAKER_07]: The rumors are true.

45
00:02:30,134 --> 00:02:34,975
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be doing some drinking on the show tonight, except, unfortunately, Jamie's not going to be able to drink.

46
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:39,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I have no doubt that I'd be able to drink excessive amounts and have it not affect my ability.

47
00:02:40,456 --> 00:02:41,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Even so, I'm not a major idiot.

48
00:02:42,797 --> 00:02:49,438
[SPEAKER_05]: So, because I have a neat little thing outside that will prevent me from driving, which I'll tell everyone about later.

49
00:02:50,078 --> 00:02:56,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, yeah, we'll talk a little bit more about... We'll talk a little bit more about the drinking when we come back from our first break.

50
00:02:56,864 --> 00:02:59,006
[SPEAKER_07]: I will play you some Initial D music during this break.

51
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,508
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll also play some Guacamole Del Taco.

52
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:03,469
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that sound?

53
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,071
[SPEAKER_07]: And some other stuff, too.

54
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:11,416
[SPEAKER_05]: So... Any other opening thoughts?

55
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:12,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

56
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:14,118
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back in a little bit.

57
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:15,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

58
00:06:29,362 --> 00:06:29,923
DarkSakura

59
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,150
Thank you for watching!

60
00:07:55,096 --> 00:08:09,460
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

61
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:15,142
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

62
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Howdy ho, kids.

63
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,712
[SPEAKER_07]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

64
00:08:21,393 --> 00:08:27,376
[SPEAKER_07]: And as we mentioned last week, some of us have a... Well, I guess maybe I'm the only one that has a three-day weekend this week.

65
00:08:28,316 --> 00:08:30,157
[SPEAKER_07]: My company celebrates Martin Luther King Jr.'

66
00:08:30,137 --> 00:08:31,478
[SPEAKER_07]: 's birthday, so I don't have to work tomorrow.

67
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:31,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitch.

68
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:33,619
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm sorry.

69
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, it ain't my fault my company rules, and yours sucks.

70
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine feeds us.

71
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:41,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine caters Chevys and... Yeah, you get barbecues.

72
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:43,904
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't get shit, so shut it, lady.

73
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,836
[SPEAKER_07]: But we decided that we would do some drinking tonight.

74
00:08:49,376 --> 00:08:53,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Except I'm really the only one that's able to drink because Jamie has to work tomorrow.

75
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:55,500
[SPEAKER_07]: And you want to tell everybody your big news?

76
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, first of all, I don't get hangovers, so I could drink.

77
00:08:58,461 --> 00:08:59,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, alright.

78
00:08:59,122 --> 00:08:59,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

79
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:00,482
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

80
00:09:00,702 --> 00:09:02,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a lightweight, as you're going to find out tonight.

81
00:09:02,303 --> 00:09:05,125
[SPEAKER_05]: You have seen how drunk I have gotten, and I've never had a hangover yet.

82
00:09:06,635 --> 00:09:08,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a car, and it owns all of you.

83
00:09:08,636 --> 00:09:09,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

84
00:09:10,356 --> 00:09:16,078
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Seafoam Aquamarini Blue Chicky Color 93 Toyota Tercel 2-door.

85
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:16,778
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a DX.

86
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:18,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have a 2 added before it.

87
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:26,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, but it's black inside, and it has a CD player, so I instantly went and burned off CDs of Eurobeat.

88
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:30,923
[SPEAKER_05]: But my car is, like, awesome, but since I drove over here...

89
00:09:31,563 --> 00:09:35,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I gave up going to the con just so I could drive my car.

90
00:09:36,587 --> 00:09:38,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Because my car made me feel happy.

91
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:39,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie got a car.

92
00:09:42,225 --> 00:09:46,047
[SPEAKER_05]: And because I'm driving tonight, I'm not going to be doing any drinking.

93
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:50,430
[SPEAKER_05]: However, because we've got three hours, I'm going to do a shot.

94
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,331
[SPEAKER_07]: In honor of the night.

95
00:09:51,351 --> 00:09:53,072
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to do one shot together.

96
00:09:53,432 --> 00:09:55,553
[SPEAKER_05]: By then, I will have peed it out or whatever.

97
00:09:55,793 --> 00:10:00,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, we have to tell everybody, because we're radio hosts, drink responsibly.

98
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,777
[SPEAKER_07]: We're being smart in how we're drinking here.

99
00:10:03,558 --> 00:10:07,240
[SPEAKER_07]: The show's done out of the spare bedroom of my house, so I don't have to go anywhere.

100
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm chasing my suntan oil with Propel.

101
00:10:10,464 --> 00:10:12,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie's gonna be letting it wear off.

102
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:13,235
[SPEAKER_07]: She's gonna do her one shot.

103
00:10:13,255 --> 00:10:14,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki's not drinking at all.

104
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:15,082
[SPEAKER_07]: He's gonna babysit.

105
00:10:15,985 --> 00:10:16,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

106
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,453
[SPEAKER_07]: and then Brad and Irene will be here in a little while and Brad's going to drink too and Irene is his driver.

107
00:10:21,693 --> 00:10:23,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm expecting that Rob's going to eventually assault Brad.

108
00:10:24,075 --> 00:10:26,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad and I are the... Assault him with what?

109
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:28,198
[SPEAKER_07]: My cock?

110
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:29,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes!

111
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes!

112
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:33,903
[SPEAKER_07]: If you will drink... Excuse me while I whip this out.

113
00:10:34,964 --> 00:10:35,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

114
00:10:35,624 --> 00:10:36,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so here we go.

115
00:10:37,526 --> 00:10:38,066
[SPEAKER_05]: A toast.

116
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:41,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I've never taken Malibu rum just straight up.

117
00:10:41,469 --> 00:10:42,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I always mix it with something.

118
00:10:42,229 --> 00:10:42,730
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never had it at all.

119
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,790
[SPEAKER_07]: This is pretty bad.

120
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here we go.

121
00:10:47,526 --> 00:10:48,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, that was weak.

122
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:48,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

123
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:51,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Very coconutty.

124
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:51,950
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it?

125
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was kind of weak, wasn't it?

126
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:54,132
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really weak.

127
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:55,133
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something you mix.

128
00:10:56,194 --> 00:10:57,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it kind of burns.

129
00:10:58,076 --> 00:10:58,436
[SPEAKER_05]: It's yummy.

130
00:10:58,456 --> 00:10:59,277
[SPEAKER_05]: It tastes like burning.

131
00:10:59,317 --> 00:11:00,158
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't burn to me.

132
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:02,920
[SPEAKER_05]: It tastes like burning.

133
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,242
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear, now I know what suntan oil tastes like.

134
00:11:05,783 --> 00:11:06,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

135
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:08,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

136
00:11:08,806 --> 00:11:10,127
[SPEAKER_07]: That left the nastiest aftertaste.

137
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:10,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, please.

138
00:11:10,727 --> 00:11:12,169
[SPEAKER_07]: That left the nastiest aftertaste.

139
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:13,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was okay.

140
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:15,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh!

141
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:16,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff was weak.

142
00:11:16,336 --> 00:11:19,578
[SPEAKER_07]: You're about to find out I'm a fucking lightweight, by the way, too.

143
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:20,399
[SPEAKER_07]: How many, how many, what?

144
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:21,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the bottle?

145
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:22,120
[SPEAKER_07]: The bottle of what?

146
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:22,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Malibu?

147
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

148
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:23,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Over here.

149
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:28,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done shots of rum, but... 21%?

150
00:11:30,686 --> 00:11:32,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, excuse me, that tastes like five.

151
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:34,828
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like drinking a wine cooler.

152
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:37,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I bet this would be really yummy with vanilla Coke.

153
00:11:38,771 --> 00:11:39,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet it would, too.

154
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do that, um, I think I got President's Day off.

155
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:45,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I don't have President's Day off.

156
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:45,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitch.

157
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,901
[SPEAKER_07]: I might be able to take it off.

158
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:48,361
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

159
00:11:48,381 --> 00:11:49,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Take off President's Day.

160
00:11:49,261 --> 00:11:49,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

161
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:50,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll drink with you.

162
00:11:50,522 --> 00:11:51,702
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to do a floating holiday.

163
00:11:51,902 --> 00:11:52,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

164
00:11:53,383 --> 00:11:55,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, hi, we're a Bomani Talk radio show, aren't we?

165
00:11:56,304 --> 00:11:56,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

166
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:57,745
[SPEAKER_07]: What's new, you guys?

167
00:11:57,785 --> 00:11:58,345
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your week?

168
00:11:58,705 --> 00:11:59,446
[SPEAKER_07]: What'd you do this week?

169
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:00,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I think my insides are getting a tan.

170
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:03,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Your insides are getting a tan?

171
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:04,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

172
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:04,368
[SPEAKER_07]: How?

173
00:12:04,428 --> 00:12:07,589
[SPEAKER_05]: In your big fluorescent light.

174
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:08,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Or whatever.

175
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:08,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

176
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:13,258
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

177
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:33,434
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened with that?

178
00:12:33,935 --> 00:12:45,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Konami released, or actually, Bomani Cell said that someone hacked the code, and then later on, about, I don't know, about five minutes later, someone's like, oh yeah, Konami just faxed in the code, you know, to all the arcades.

179
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:46,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Oops, I guess they didn't hack the code.

180
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:52,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, so there's a code out there now that's for three Oni courses and three non-stop courses.

181
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:57,528
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to play the one non-stop course the other day with Twinbee in it, and that was pretty fun.

182
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:01,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Other than that... Will Twin be a playable song normally?

183
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:06,251
[SPEAKER_25]: It will be.

184
00:13:07,531 --> 00:13:08,452
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll play that for a dollar.

185
00:13:09,892 --> 00:13:12,773
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, yeah, that'll be coming up.

186
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:18,475
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's the Guitar Freaks Drum Mania Oni Chorus with at least 100 seconds and Across the Nightmare in it.

187
00:13:18,915 --> 00:13:19,795
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of cool.

188
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:26,497
[SPEAKER_08]: And other than that, we've also been having slight problems with the machine lately.

189
00:13:27,397 --> 00:13:30,779
[SPEAKER_08]: And the problems are that the machine keeps freezing up during the middle of songs.

190
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Max 2 did that same shit though, didn't it?

191
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:36,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Where like after you play a certain set of songs, like one of the internet rankings?

192
00:13:36,443 --> 00:13:38,244
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this has nothing to do with internet rankings.

193
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,484
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a glitch in the whole thing.

194
00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:41,506
[SPEAKER_08]: This has to do with like a smudge on the CD.

195
00:13:41,766 --> 00:13:44,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Meaning you'll play a song and all of a sudden, boom, it'll freeze up.

196
00:13:44,968 --> 00:13:50,691
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if it's a smudge on the CD because if that were the case, the music would skip because the music's on the CD.

197
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:53,753
[SPEAKER_08]: But what happens is the music keeps going, the steps freeze.

198
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:55,466
[SPEAKER_16]: Yikes.

199
00:13:55,946 --> 00:14:03,430
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a pretty nasty bug there, and they're going to be hopefully reinstalling it all on Monday, and hopefully that'll fix the problem.

200
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if that's happening in other places, or if it's just specific to our local arcade.

201
00:14:10,913 --> 00:14:11,554
[SPEAKER_05]: JB told me that.

202
00:14:11,614 --> 00:14:12,074
[SPEAKER_05]: It happened to him.

203
00:14:13,214 --> 00:14:13,555
[SPEAKER_25]: Dope.

204
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,156
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, I don't know.

205
00:14:17,795 --> 00:14:21,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Other than that, I got yet another bonus from my company.

206
00:14:23,717 --> 00:14:23,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Another $800.

207
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:26,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to buy your machine yet?

208
00:14:27,118 --> 00:14:28,059
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not buying my machine.

209
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:29,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm paying off my credit card.

210
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Paying off my credit card and getting my savings account where it should be.

211
00:14:34,261 --> 00:14:36,822
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, you know, hopefully...

212
00:14:38,303 --> 00:14:40,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember the issue with the 6 sound, 7 sound videos?

213
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:08,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, that's right.

214
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:14,434
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that kind of sucks, but it happens every now and then.

215
00:15:15,075 --> 00:15:15,695
[SPEAKER_08]: It's no big deal.

216
00:15:15,735 --> 00:15:19,338
[SPEAKER_08]: But other than that, with my money, I went and bought a GameCube.

217
00:15:19,838 --> 00:15:22,740
[SPEAKER_08]: And with that GameCube, I also got Animal Crossing.

218
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

219
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:25,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to the crack world addiction.

220
00:15:25,782 --> 00:15:31,686
[SPEAKER_08]: So now I've joined the cult of Animal Crossing in my wonderfully named town of Big Cock.

221
00:15:33,536 --> 00:15:34,937
[SPEAKER_08]: It was my girlfriend's idea, okay?

222
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:35,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Not mine.

223
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:36,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my.

224
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:43,424
[SPEAKER_08]: We were thinking of something to name it, and it was funny, so we named it Big Cock, and it makes for some really funny dialogue.

225
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:46,667
[SPEAKER_07]: If you two have a baby, you know, five years down the road, you gonna name your baby Big Cock?

226
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:48,509
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

227
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:55,294
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um, yeah, so that's the name of our town, and it's pretty cool.

228
00:15:55,895 --> 00:15:56,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Pearl's a bitch.

229
00:15:57,316 --> 00:15:57,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, she is.

230
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:00,419
[SPEAKER_05]: I got pushed, you left our town.

231
00:16:01,016 --> 00:16:05,938
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't like her, and yeah, so that's what I've been playing, playing Animal Crossing.

232
00:16:06,478 --> 00:16:13,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and another thing I found out, I finished testing my DDR Max 2 edit machine code thing.

233
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:28,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently the number is not a pattern at all, and it's randomly generated, so no, I'm not going to test all 16,000 combinations, because that would take forever, and it would be a waste of my time, and it's coming out in April, so what do I give a shit about that, so...

234
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:34,067
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm sure that'll be news we'll be giving out later.

235
00:16:34,087 --> 00:16:34,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

236
00:16:36,316 --> 00:16:36,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Jamie?

237
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:39,797
[SPEAKER_05]: April is when my birthday is and someone could buy me something.

238
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:44,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Max 2 for the Japanese system is coming out April.

239
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,481
[SPEAKER_08]: And, of course, the U.S.

240
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:48,402
[SPEAKER_08]: version is coming out around November.

241
00:16:48,422 --> 00:16:50,804
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit delayed.

242
00:16:50,964 --> 00:16:51,564
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little late.

243
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like DDR USA.

244
00:16:53,606 --> 00:16:54,126
[SPEAKER_07]: A late birth.

245
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:56,968
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll hear it here first.

246
00:16:57,008 --> 00:16:59,249
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a few of the tracks that are going to be in there.

247
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:00,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

248
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:01,431
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got...

249
00:17:02,392 --> 00:17:03,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, how do you know this, Mr. Man?

250
00:17:03,953 --> 00:17:04,533
[SPEAKER_08]: How do I know this?

251
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:05,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, because they're done already.

252
00:17:06,154 --> 00:17:11,596
[SPEAKER_08]: They were going to be in DDR Max USA, but they were like, no, we're going to cut it out and, you know, wait, put them in the next one.

253
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:12,177
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

254
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:19,120
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we've got Nemesis, Keep On Liftin', and, um, uh, that's a weird name going from Six Style.

255
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Big Black Cop.

256
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,261
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not Big Black Cop.

257
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:21,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Speed Mix.

258
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:23,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that's it.

259
00:17:25,785 --> 00:17:28,590
[SPEAKER_07]: M-2 Step 101 or something like that.

260
00:17:29,311 --> 00:17:32,496
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they're not in Max 2, then you never heard it here.

261
00:17:33,397 --> 00:17:35,661
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they don't end up in Max 2, you never heard it here.

262
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:36,663
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't say anything about it.

263
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:59,730
[SPEAKER_07]: but Max Japan, I bet you anything Max Japan's going to have that, Max 2 Japan will have that Drop the Bomb remix as an unlocked track and what else, it's going to have, because you know how you can, yes, the Dynamite Rave remix, thank you Jimmy, because you know how you can sort the list in Xtreme by...

264
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:06,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Game, you can see that there's the one that songs from Holmes versions.

265
00:18:06,813 --> 00:18:12,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they have like the Drop the Bomb mix in there, and they have the Dynamite Rave one in there, but they don't have the True Colors mix.

266
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:13,676
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because it's unlockable.

267
00:18:13,996 --> 00:18:14,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, is it?

268
00:18:14,616 --> 00:18:15,737
[SPEAKER_08]: It's unlockable.

269
00:18:15,997 --> 00:18:17,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Dynamite Rave's not in there yet either.

270
00:18:17,717 --> 00:18:19,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well shit, I'll be damned.

271
00:18:19,518 --> 00:18:23,741
[SPEAKER_08]: And the only one, Do It Right, the two-step version is going to be in there.

272
00:18:24,262 --> 00:18:29,045
[SPEAKER_07]: But since those are all supposedly home version Unlocked songs, that would mean they need to be in a Japanese home release.

273
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:30,967
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I bet we'll be seeing those in Max 2 Japan.

274
00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:31,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.

275
00:18:32,008 --> 00:18:33,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, not necessarily, though.

276
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:37,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, look at AM3P303 Bass Mix.

277
00:18:38,012 --> 00:18:38,933
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not in there yet.

278
00:18:39,713 --> 00:18:40,214
[SPEAKER_07]: But it might.

279
00:18:40,254 --> 00:18:41,094
[SPEAKER_07]: That might be another one.

280
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:41,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah!

281
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:42,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah!

282
00:18:43,176 --> 00:18:44,077
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know...

283
00:18:44,777 --> 00:18:45,237
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

284
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:49,319
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope they release something new instead of all this rehashed shit, you know.

285
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:50,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I want to see some new shit, too.

286
00:18:53,361 --> 00:18:54,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to the bathroom.

287
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:55,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Gross!

288
00:18:57,984 --> 00:19:02,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, what's new in the sim world, Loki, as long as we're talking to you in the start of this show here?

289
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:08,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, just, uh, well, other than my site coming up next week, yeah, I know it was supposed to be this week, but we ran into script issues with there.

290
00:19:08,887 --> 00:19:10,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right, you were playing Animal Crossing all week.

291
00:19:10,668 --> 00:19:15,409
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I wasn't, so we ran into problems with that, and, um, it should be coming up next week.

292
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:23,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, I don't know, I'm debating because our tech people at work are going through all of our computers and deleting all non-30 party stuff.

293
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,632
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have all my stuff hidden, but he hasn't quite gotten to my computer yet.

294
00:19:27,152 --> 00:19:33,673
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have to wait for him to come by and supposedly delete everything so I can reinstall everything and then get back to what I was doing.

295
00:19:34,313 --> 00:19:36,774
[SPEAKER_08]: But I have to wait for that to happen before I can, you know...

296
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:52,431
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, I could probably upload everything right away, but they're just being super anal because our HR department thinks for some reason that background screensavers and other stuff like that cause viruses because they're dumbasses and don't know shit about computers.

297
00:19:54,688 --> 00:19:58,492
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, hopefully everything should be coming up.

298
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:00,474
[SPEAKER_08]: The site's already sort of up right now.

299
00:20:00,514 --> 00:20:05,500
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you can email me to, you know, get your account set up so you can upload shit.

300
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:14,049
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's going to be www.willddrforfood.net slash leechfromloki.

301
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:17,225
[SPEAKER_08]: DanSenseRevolution, Paranoia Survivor Max

302
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Other than that, also check out Bomani Sims.

303
00:20:37,422 --> 00:20:45,447
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll see a lot of stuff that other people are releasing on there if you've missed it on, say, DDR Mania X, which is also down right now, but the forums are still working.

304
00:20:46,448 --> 00:20:49,130
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR East Coast Invasion I haven't looked at today.

305
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:51,112
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think anything's going on there.

306
00:20:51,912 --> 00:20:53,633
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's pretty much it.

307
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:54,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Not too much.

308
00:20:56,696 --> 00:20:56,976
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah.

309
00:20:59,232 --> 00:21:02,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, while Loki was telling us about what's going on in the Bomani world.

310
00:21:02,454 --> 00:21:05,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I was about to do a shot of this stuff that looks like wall touch.

311
00:21:05,796 --> 00:21:07,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie was sitting there going, I'm hot.

312
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:12,999
[SPEAKER_07]: And she wasn't talking about, you know, just like, oh damn, you know, I got it, I'm sexy.

313
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,220
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm too sexy for this show.

314
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,781
[SPEAKER_07]: She's not saying anything to do with it.

315
00:21:16,661 --> 00:21:17,501
[SPEAKER_07]: I was feeling her face.

316
00:21:17,641 --> 00:21:20,402
[SPEAKER_07]: She is indeed a little hot from that shot.

317
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:27,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I always get warm with my fresh... Put the thermometer against your face and see what you measure.

318
00:21:27,324 --> 00:21:27,584
[SPEAKER_05]: This one?

319
00:21:27,924 --> 00:21:30,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

320
00:21:30,985 --> 00:21:31,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel retarded.

321
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:33,626
[SPEAKER_07]: You look retarded.

322
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:34,126
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

323
00:21:34,486 --> 00:21:34,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Here.

324
00:21:34,886 --> 00:21:36,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, but it feels nice because I'm hot.

325
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:37,067
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really cold.

326
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:38,688
[SPEAKER_05]: God damn it, Rob.

327
00:21:38,728 --> 00:21:40,408
[SPEAKER_05]: These things burn at a thousand degrees.

328
00:21:40,468 --> 00:21:41,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like burning heat.

329
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:43,669
[SPEAKER_07]: While she's doing that, I'm going to take a shot.

330
00:21:43,749 --> 00:21:44,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to do my next shot here.

331
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,310
[SPEAKER_07]: This is some hot damn.

332
00:21:46,811 --> 00:21:47,391
[SPEAKER_07]: So, cheers.

333
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to toast Loki's water here.

334
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:50,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait.

335
00:21:51,092 --> 00:21:52,293
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like Walt Husson.

336
00:21:57,995 --> 00:22:00,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, I'm currently pointing and laughing at Rob.

337
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:01,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

338
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:07,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

339
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,721
[SPEAKER_07]: It tastes like 20 Cinnamon Jolly Ranchers all at once.

340
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:12,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew.

341
00:22:14,024 --> 00:22:15,186
[SPEAKER_05]: That other thing looks like butter.

342
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:16,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Like butter.

343
00:22:17,229 --> 00:22:17,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Butter.

344
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Crack, crack, butter.

345
00:22:20,824 --> 00:22:23,627
[SPEAKER_07]: I shouldn't be drinking so much until Brad and Irene get here.

346
00:22:24,027 --> 00:22:24,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Well.

347
00:22:24,608 --> 00:22:28,431
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are going to have to carry this show once I pass out, so enjoy.

348
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:32,414
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I should make a run to Walgreens and get you stuff.

349
00:22:32,615 --> 00:22:33,996
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been drinking, young lady.

350
00:22:34,036 --> 00:22:34,676
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't drive.

351
00:22:34,816 --> 00:22:35,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go in an hour.

352
00:22:36,498 --> 00:22:37,158
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll go in an hour.

353
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:40,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Make Brad and Irene go when they get here before they start drinking.

354
00:22:40,862 --> 00:22:45,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I want another two liter of Pepsi and bag of pretzels so I can get sick again.

355
00:22:46,647 --> 00:22:48,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make them get maraschino cherries.

356
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:09,874
[SPEAKER_07]: and we'll soak him in the Nalibu you know what sucks is when I get really drunk I start making out with everybody but y'all are prudes so I don't know I think it's that we're both taken that too no I know but you should have seen this one New Year's party I went to I got to see Rob make out with a girl shut up

357
00:23:16,903 --> 00:23:17,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

358
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:20,825
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be funny because we're going to get lots of blackmail material on Rob.

359
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:21,726
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you're not.

360
00:23:21,926 --> 00:23:23,007
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to delete this episode.

361
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:24,127
[SPEAKER_07]: It's never going to air again.

362
00:23:25,868 --> 00:23:27,149
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be the long lost episode.

363
00:23:27,369 --> 00:23:30,150
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going the way of the taped at Scandia episode.

364
00:23:30,591 --> 00:23:31,031
[SPEAKER_08]: It's alright.

365
00:23:31,051 --> 00:23:31,611
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that.

366
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:32,612
[SPEAKER_07]: How hot is your face?

367
00:23:34,473 --> 00:23:34,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

368
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:36,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie measures in at...

369
00:23:38,795 --> 00:23:40,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, she's off the scale!

370
00:23:40,276 --> 00:23:40,716
[SPEAKER_07]: She's off 86.

371
00:23:40,816 --> 00:23:43,177
[SPEAKER_07]: 86 is as high as it goes.

372
00:23:43,197 --> 00:23:43,957
[SPEAKER_07]: She's hotter than that.

373
00:23:44,617 --> 00:23:45,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we need to get her a thermometer.

374
00:23:46,298 --> 00:23:47,379
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes sense, but you know.

375
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:48,839
[SPEAKER_08]: This one works better.

376
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:49,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

377
00:23:52,141 --> 00:23:53,461
[SPEAKER_08]: She put it down her cleavage.

378
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:54,201
[SPEAKER_08]: This one sucks.

379
00:23:58,283 --> 00:23:58,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

380
00:23:59,123 --> 00:24:01,184
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting Sakura Boopy action on this show.

381
00:24:01,204 --> 00:24:03,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't show my boobs.

382
00:24:04,185 --> 00:24:04,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

383
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:06,266
[SPEAKER_07]: You haven't drunken enough yet.

384
00:24:06,286 --> 00:24:07,587
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not gonna.

385
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:14,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, yeah, um, what else can we talk about that's Bimani-related?

386
00:24:14,394 --> 00:24:18,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's see, I gotta kinda cover the, carry the show here.

387
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:22,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Just remember the Shaft live coverage you had to do all by yourself.

388
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:24,580
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, that's awful.

389
00:24:25,241 --> 00:24:28,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, here's the big stuff that's coming up, uh, that happened.

390
00:24:29,283 --> 00:24:34,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, they're starting now testing for Guitar Freaks 8, er, 9, and Drumania 8s.

391
00:24:35,586 --> 00:24:38,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, it's the same goddamn game with new numbers.

392
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:43,596
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's got the cool little thingy with the cards that no one's ever going to get.

393
00:24:44,637 --> 00:24:45,298
[SPEAKER_05]: A neat font.

394
00:24:45,378 --> 00:24:46,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's pretty looking.

395
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,361
[SPEAKER_07]: And they changed the names to GF and DM.

396
00:24:50,604 --> 00:24:52,306
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, it needs to be Guitadora.

397
00:24:53,607 --> 00:24:54,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Like fourth and third.

398
00:24:56,499 --> 00:24:57,060
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, though?

399
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,842
[SPEAKER_07]: At AI, they have the power-up versions.

400
00:24:59,862 --> 00:25:03,725
[SPEAKER_07]: They're supposed to have the neat little initial, do you want to be card things, and they don't have them at AI.

401
00:25:04,246 --> 00:25:04,986
[SPEAKER_07]: I made me sad.

402
00:25:05,267 --> 00:25:08,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I know, and I've talked about this like three weeks in a row.

403
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:10,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Brian's out.

404
00:25:10,571 --> 00:25:11,832
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll close the door, Jamie.

405
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:15,515
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I didn't get another card.

406
00:25:16,496 --> 00:25:19,419
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I need another card to mate with my Derby Owner's cards.

407
00:25:20,325 --> 00:25:32,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, my thing is full, and I can't, someone, one of our Bay Area listeners, buy me one of those card binders for my horses, and I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll think kindly of you.

408
00:25:33,637 --> 00:25:37,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, let's see, other stuff in the world, since I gotta kind of stretch this out, whatever it is.

409
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, wait, I want to know something about Guitar Freaks Night and Dromania.

410
00:25:40,723 --> 00:25:42,345
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a song in there called I'm a Loser.

411
00:25:42,465 --> 00:25:43,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the Beatles song?

412
00:25:45,788 --> 00:25:50,954
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a loser I'm a loser What's that?

413
00:25:54,338 --> 00:25:55,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, how was the concert?

414
00:25:55,499 --> 00:25:57,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, tell us about the concert you went to last night

415
00:25:58,351 --> 00:25:59,552
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

416
00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:22,735
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was a really good show.

417
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,396
[SPEAKER_05]: He was, of course, really sexy.

418
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,777
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody decided to go up front.

419
00:26:26,097 --> 00:26:28,399
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, fuck going up front, because you know what?

420
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:30,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I ate ten penguins.

421
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:34,843
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was going through caffeine shock at the time and decided to sit there where I was.

422
00:26:35,484 --> 00:26:36,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I got up this morning.

423
00:26:36,164 --> 00:26:38,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to go to the convention to see him, but that started at 4.10.

424
00:26:39,687 --> 00:26:41,208
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had to be here at 5, okay?

425
00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:44,390
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wasn't going to have time to enjoy myself in the dealer's room.

426
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't want to deal with that.

427
00:26:46,091 --> 00:26:51,915
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, I skipped out on that, sold my ticket to my friend Krista, went out for breakfast.

428
00:26:52,615 --> 00:26:54,196
[SPEAKER_07]: How much were tickets to the sci-fi convention?

429
00:26:54,216 --> 00:26:55,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Twenty-five a day.

430
00:26:55,157 --> 00:26:55,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Dang.

431
00:26:55,277 --> 00:27:00,780
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't want to give... But it was supposed to have Captain Janeway of the Starship Voyager.

432
00:27:00,961 --> 00:27:02,782
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Captain Janeway.

433
00:27:03,902 --> 00:27:04,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Warp drive.

434
00:27:06,064 --> 00:27:06,224
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

435
00:27:07,024 --> 00:27:10,447
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, it was just, it was just, uh-uh.

436
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:12,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I decided against it.

437
00:27:12,928 --> 00:27:14,049
[SPEAKER_05]: So I bought Dojinshi instead.

438
00:27:15,785 --> 00:27:20,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Captain Janeway should have been, like, ejected into space when the show started.

439
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:25,049
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you can't eject Captain Janeway into space.

440
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:27,110
[SPEAKER_05]: She was a cool captain, but she did not have the Picard factor.

441
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,910
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you talking about?

442
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,991
[SPEAKER_08]: She's, like, she could have been bald and manlier.

443
00:27:33,892 --> 00:27:36,233
[SPEAKER_08]: And she just needed to be bald and she would have had it down.

444
00:27:37,214 --> 00:27:39,194
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Picard in a fucking wig.

445
00:27:39,414 --> 00:27:40,155
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it was.

446
00:27:40,595 --> 00:27:40,955
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

447
00:27:42,175 --> 00:27:42,716
[SPEAKER_08]: She was cool.

448
00:27:43,576 --> 00:27:46,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe we're actually talking Star Trek on this show.

449
00:27:46,357 --> 00:27:52,498
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if we weren't like the biggest dorks on the planet already, I think that just brought our show to an all-time new low.

450
00:27:52,518 --> 00:27:55,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Picard and Janeway had a baby.

451
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:57,239
[SPEAKER_08]: What would that look like?

452
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:02,060
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be Jane Card, or something like that.

453
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Pickway.

454
00:28:05,501 --> 00:28:06,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that a store, Pickin' Way?

455
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:07,641
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

456
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:11,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm going to do another shot.

457
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:12,409
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that sound?

458
00:28:14,591 --> 00:28:15,091
[SPEAKER_07]: That's too late.

459
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:17,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I already poured me a shot of hot damn.

460
00:28:17,953 --> 00:28:18,894
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to mix.

461
00:28:18,974 --> 00:28:22,697
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be nasty, like hot butter, hot buttery nipple sex.

462
00:28:23,658 --> 00:28:24,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

463
00:28:24,498 --> 00:28:26,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here's another shot of hot damn.

464
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:26,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it slurpy.

465
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Make it slurpy?

466
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:28,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it slurpy.

467
00:28:32,264 --> 00:28:33,185
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good radio.

468
00:28:38,328 --> 00:28:38,849
[SPEAKER_15]: You okay?

469
00:28:39,489 --> 00:28:40,270
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, God.

470
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to smell the better stuff.

471
00:28:45,586 --> 00:28:48,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that shit is nasty, fuck.

472
00:28:50,871 --> 00:28:51,731
[SPEAKER_02]: You slurped it.

473
00:28:54,654 --> 00:28:56,155
[SPEAKER_08]: My mouth's on fire.

474
00:28:57,256 --> 00:28:58,417
[SPEAKER_08]: His mouth's on fire.

475
00:29:03,801 --> 00:29:07,845
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I'm trying to push the show along.

476
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,259
[SPEAKER_08]: It does smell like Werther's.

477
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,001
[SPEAKER_08]: It smells like Werther's.

478
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:17,322
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, it, oh.

479
00:29:21,664 --> 00:29:25,426
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the butterscotch stuff tastes like candy.

480
00:29:25,466 --> 00:29:27,067
[SPEAKER_07]: It tastes like liquid candy things.

481
00:29:28,427 --> 00:29:30,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Check the proof on Hot Damn.

482
00:29:30,588 --> 00:29:30,928
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's 100.

483
00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:33,049
[SPEAKER_07]: It says Hot Damn 100.

484
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:33,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's 100 proof.

485
00:29:37,293 --> 00:29:42,157
[SPEAKER_07]: No, and I... I cannot hold liquor for shit.

486
00:29:42,257 --> 00:29:43,618
Oh my god, it does taste like candy.

487
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:45,419
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not supposed to be drinking anymore.

488
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, fine.

489
00:29:50,943 --> 00:29:52,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie's got to call a taxi.

490
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:53,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I want some of this stuff.

491
00:29:53,665 --> 00:29:54,766
[SPEAKER_05]: This stuff tastes yummy.

492
00:29:54,806 --> 00:29:55,427
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like candy.

493
00:29:55,947 --> 00:29:57,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe you've never had butterscotch snaps.

494
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:00,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways...

495
00:30:03,405 --> 00:30:05,489
[SPEAKER_08]: So, other stuff in the Pomani world.

496
00:30:07,412 --> 00:30:08,694
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some tournaments coming up.

497
00:30:09,115 --> 00:30:09,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to talk about tournaments.

498
00:30:09,997 --> 00:30:11,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, good, because I don't know Jack about these things.

499
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,944
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to be playing Theme of Flojack, Mr. Junk Remix.

500
00:30:15,764 --> 00:30:16,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we even have that?

501
00:30:16,605 --> 00:30:17,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it on one of your pre-shows?

502
00:30:18,246 --> 00:30:18,707
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I do.

503
00:30:19,047 --> 00:30:27,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I want to talk about upcoming tournaments, because at least in the Bay Area, and I apologize because I know this is a national show, but I don't know much about what's going on on the East Coast.

504
00:30:27,734 --> 00:30:36,261
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you want to send me private messages, if you want to plug a tournament, send me a private message, I'll plug it for you in the chat room.

505
00:30:36,622 --> 00:30:41,065
[SPEAKER_07]: If you aren't in the chat room, just visit our webpage, orangelounge.skie.cx.

506
00:30:41,486 --> 00:30:42,466
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that simple.

507
00:30:43,027 --> 00:30:44,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, upcoming tournaments.

508
00:30:44,728 --> 00:30:48,392
[SPEAKER_07]: January 31st is Miggle Extreme at Milpitas Golf Land.

509
00:30:48,412 --> 00:30:50,373
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be Perfect Attack and Improv Freestyle.

510
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:53,456
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually am going to have a half day off work, so I'm going to go.

511
00:30:53,656 --> 00:30:54,117
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be fun.

512
00:30:55,538 --> 00:30:58,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, are you going to enter PA just for the hell of it?

513
00:30:58,921 --> 00:31:00,863
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so, because this is the problem.

514
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:07,848
[SPEAKER_07]: See, now since I placed fourth at the last one, and I guess, you know, as they're saying, I upset people and da-da-da, you know, all that stuff.

515
00:31:08,228 --> 00:31:09,589
[SPEAKER_07]: There's too much pressure.

516
00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:13,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, now I'm expected to enter again, and I don't want that pressure.

517
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:14,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to quit while I'm ahead, I think.

518
00:31:14,512 --> 00:31:15,593
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be a lazy bum.

519
00:31:16,013 --> 00:31:16,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to retire.

520
00:31:17,174 --> 00:31:17,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to do that.

521
00:31:17,654 --> 00:31:20,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to retire from DDR, and like in a month, I'll come back.

522
00:31:20,876 --> 00:31:22,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll say, oh, I fell in love with the game again.

523
00:31:23,358 --> 00:31:24,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Because everybody does that.

524
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Cut the bullshit.

525
00:31:27,901 --> 00:31:28,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Just fuck their world up.

526
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,082
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about time somebody else got in the top category.

527
00:31:35,563 --> 00:31:37,844
[SPEAKER_08]: The first place should not go to an Asian.

528
00:31:40,406 --> 00:31:40,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

529
00:31:41,046 --> 00:31:42,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you a racist, sir?

530
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:42,767
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

531
00:31:43,007 --> 00:31:43,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

532
00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:44,388
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just kidding.

533
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:47,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to get really good at Perfect Attack so I can win.

534
00:31:48,871 --> 00:31:49,652
[SPEAKER_07]: You do that, girl.

535
00:31:49,892 --> 00:31:53,354
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to memorize all the songs on Stealth and make them play them on Stealth and then I'll win.

536
00:31:54,815 --> 00:31:55,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, no, I'm not going to do that.

537
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:58,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, shit, what else?

538
00:31:58,323 --> 00:31:59,063
[SPEAKER_07]: What other tournaments?

539
00:31:59,103 --> 00:32:00,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, CyberZone.

540
00:32:00,984 --> 00:32:01,545
[SPEAKER_07]: CyberZone.

541
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:08,309
[SPEAKER_07]: And these guys, these guys have some big balls over there because they have this whole commercial that they're doing now.

542
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:10,671
[SPEAKER_07]: They have this whole, like, yeah, they put it on the web.

543
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:11,612
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I'd saved it.

544
00:32:11,632 --> 00:32:13,113
[SPEAKER_07]: I deleted the damn thing after watching it once.

545
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:14,434
[SPEAKER_07]: They put a commercial up online.

546
00:32:15,174 --> 00:32:16,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.

547
00:32:35,898 --> 00:32:40,040
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what you'd call it, the ego to be doing something like that, a commercial.

548
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,683
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's going to be like a two, three day tournament, and that's in LA in a couple weeks.

549
00:32:43,723 --> 00:32:44,683
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jamie's mad at them.

550
00:32:44,843 --> 00:32:45,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you mad at them, Jamie?

551
00:32:45,724 --> 00:32:46,825
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be part of my fuck you of the week.

552
00:32:47,205 --> 00:32:48,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's going to be part of your fuck you of the week?

553
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:48,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

554
00:32:49,106 --> 00:32:49,907
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get to that later then.

555
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:53,209
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm going to be trying to go to CyberZone, so...

556
00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:54,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

557
00:32:55,250 --> 00:33:03,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's check my private messages, because I think we're going to be having some... Some messages about... He's already uncoordinated.

558
00:33:03,296 --> 00:33:03,857
[SPEAKER_05]: This is funny.

559
00:33:04,998 --> 00:33:07,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, I got... Look, it's sticky.

560
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,901
[SPEAKER_07]: My desk is sticky.

561
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:09,521
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awful.

562
00:33:09,581 --> 00:33:10,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's personal issues, man.

563
00:33:11,102 --> 00:33:11,563
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

564
00:33:11,683 --> 00:33:13,784
[SPEAKER_15]: Not that, you perverts!

565
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:14,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Gross.

566
00:33:15,325 --> 00:33:15,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Gross!

567
00:33:18,468 --> 00:33:21,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Bob, I'll tell you what, we'll just get you some wet naps by your monitor.

568
00:33:23,072 --> 00:33:26,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Muheimer says the East has no tournaments and no machines and they suck.

569
00:33:26,533 --> 00:33:28,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Just go to look on DDR Freak on the tournament section.

570
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:31,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we talk about the possibility of Shaft 2?

571
00:33:31,754 --> 00:33:32,754
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because it's a long ways away.

572
00:33:33,255 --> 00:33:34,315
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like next November.

573
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:34,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

574
00:33:35,315 --> 00:33:36,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, back to basics.

575
00:33:36,976 --> 00:33:38,876
[SPEAKER_07]: February 8th at American Comics.

576
00:33:39,396 --> 00:33:40,536
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fourth plus tourney.

577
00:33:40,656 --> 00:33:41,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, old school.

578
00:33:41,877 --> 00:33:42,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Right on.

579
00:33:44,017 --> 00:33:45,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone take the nuts away from me.

580
00:33:45,918 --> 00:33:46,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

581
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:47,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold my nuts.

582
00:33:47,598 --> 00:33:47,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

583
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:50,599
[SPEAKER_05]: My nuts are bouncy.

584
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:53,118
[SPEAKER_04]: and Greasy.

585
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,861
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just eating my nuts now.

586
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:56,722
[SPEAKER_19]: I like your nuts.

587
00:33:59,825 --> 00:34:01,507
[SPEAKER_19]: DEAD AIR!

588
00:34:01,547 --> 00:34:01,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

589
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:02,928
[SPEAKER_19]: What do you want me to talk about?

590
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,872
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, it's in Hayward.

591
00:34:06,152 --> 00:34:08,294
[SPEAKER_05]: We need someone new to dedicate our dead air to, by the way.

592
00:34:10,337 --> 00:34:11,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we dedicate our dead airspace to?

593
00:34:13,726 --> 00:34:14,066
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

594
00:34:14,767 --> 00:34:17,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's dedicate it to Chubbs, because he was supposed to be here tonight, but he flaked.

595
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:17,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

596
00:34:18,908 --> 00:34:20,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight's Dead Airspace is dedicated to Chubbs.

597
00:34:21,069 --> 00:34:21,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

598
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:23,470
[SPEAKER_07]: He's Poe.

599
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:26,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we're going to take a break and gather ourselves.

600
00:34:26,772 --> 00:34:27,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And pee.

601
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,013
[SPEAKER_07]: But before we get a break, I think I want to do another shot.

602
00:34:31,054 --> 00:34:31,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Goddamn.

603
00:34:33,098 --> 00:34:35,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, he's doing a shot of candy now.

604
00:34:37,561 --> 00:34:39,702
[SPEAKER_05]: My voice is fucked up from last night.

605
00:34:40,443 --> 00:34:41,644
[SPEAKER_05]: From all that coughing I've been doing.

606
00:34:42,864 --> 00:34:44,105
[SPEAKER_05]: I sound like a 12-year-old boy.

607
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:48,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Cheers!

[SPEAKER_07]: One for me, and one for my homies.

611
00:34:55,492 --> 00:34:56,173
[SPEAKER_25]: I just spit.

612
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:57,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheers!

613
00:34:57,794 --> 00:34:59,175
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean you ain't got no homies?

614
00:35:00,716 --> 00:35:02,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I've made Rob snort his liquor.

615
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:13,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we're going to go into a break now, and we're going to start that break with... I don't know, what do we want to hear?

616
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,294
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to drive my computer drunk.

617
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:20,355
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got CDs.

618
00:35:20,556 --> 00:35:21,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's your CD?

619
00:35:21,436 --> 00:35:21,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it in here?

620
00:35:21,976 --> 00:35:23,016
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's right here.

621
00:35:23,036 --> 00:35:25,237
[SPEAKER_08]: It's right here.

622
00:35:25,277 --> 00:35:25,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me.

623
00:35:25,737 --> 00:35:26,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get it sticky.

624
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:27,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me.

625
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:32,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not want to hear get sticky and rob in the same sentence.

626
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

627
00:35:34,136 --> 00:35:34,696
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

628
00:35:35,237 --> 00:35:39,080

00:35:40,821 --> 00:35:46,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna sit back and let my shot wear off.

632
00:35:47,966 --> 00:35:49,947
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna play something from Extreme.

[SPEAKER_07]: You suck at the DDR.

[SPEAKER_05]: Nowki, you ain't.

00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:25,837
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one that goes, ooh, baby, or something like that.

666
00:43:25,878 --> 00:43:26,598
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really funny.

667
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:27,398

00:43:33,202 --> 00:43:37,244
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, there it is.

671
00:43:38,005 --> 00:43:38,505
[SPEAKER_15]: Excellent.

00:43:40,646 --> 00:43:41,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

00:43:41,907 --> 00:43:43,308
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my roommate's keyboard.

00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:44,569
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really cool.

676
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:49,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, hi, welcome to Orange Slides.

677
00:43:49,366 --> 00:43:50,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Just tuning in.

678
00:43:50,987 --> 00:43:54,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight's the show where I've been doing a little bit of drinking.

679
00:43:54,869 --> 00:43:55,990
[SPEAKER_05]: You sound like you're about to cry.

680
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:58,392
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not!

681
00:44:04,346 --> 00:44:09,048
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jamie's had a shot, but she's got to be driving home in three hours, so she can only have her one shot.

682
00:44:09,068 --> 00:44:11,949
[SPEAKER_07]: She's got to pee it out before she can drive home.

683
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:15,210
[SPEAKER_07]: And Loki's the responsible one of the bunch.

684
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,230
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not drinking at all.

685
00:44:16,611 --> 00:44:17,231
[SPEAKER_07]: What a good boy.

686
00:44:18,511 --> 00:44:19,172
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't drink.

687
00:44:19,492 --> 00:44:19,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Ever.

688
00:44:21,232 --> 00:44:22,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any particular reason?

689
00:44:22,153 --> 00:44:23,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that for religious reasons or what?

690
00:44:25,134 --> 00:44:27,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if I think if I get drunk, I'll probably become violent and kill people.

691
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:29,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool, let's get a drink.

692
00:44:29,491 --> 00:44:30,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool, let's get you drunk.

693
00:44:30,271 --> 00:44:32,753
[SPEAKER_08]: I've decided to have work tomorrow.

694
00:44:33,354 --> 00:44:34,235
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

695
00:44:34,715 --> 00:44:35,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I could drink.

696
00:44:35,816 --> 00:44:38,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Hooray for Martin Luther King Jr., because I don't have to work tomorrow.

697
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:41,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Start the song.

698
00:44:42,921 --> 00:44:43,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

699
00:44:43,522 --> 00:44:44,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Start the song.

700
00:44:44,342 --> 00:44:47,765
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get into the... Oh, shit, I almost knocked your shot glass over.

701
00:44:47,825 --> 00:44:47,965
[SPEAKER_07]: My bad.

702
00:44:48,025 --> 00:44:48,486
[SPEAKER_05]: It's empty.

703
00:44:48,606 --> 00:44:49,226
[SPEAKER_07]: My bad.

704
00:44:49,246 --> 00:44:49,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, have the rest.

705
00:44:55,851 --> 00:44:56,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a drop.

706
00:44:59,262 --> 00:45:04,524
[SPEAKER_07]: You dropped the bomb on my tongue.

707
00:45:04,944 --> 00:45:06,185
[SPEAKER_05]: God damn it, play my song.

708
00:45:06,665 --> 00:45:07,805
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, we're not into that.

709
00:45:07,825 --> 00:45:11,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Ew, you're disgusting.

710
00:45:11,326 --> 00:45:12,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's my propel?

711
00:45:12,527 --> 00:45:13,067
[SPEAKER_07]: God.

712
00:45:13,447 --> 00:45:15,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we're going to get into the FUs of the week.

713
00:45:16,288 --> 00:45:19,289
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jamie, tell the chatroom about the FUs of the week.

714
00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:22,610
[SPEAKER_07]: You can start sending those to me over private message, by the way, in the chatroom.

715
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:23,811
[SPEAKER_07]: FUs of the week.

716
00:45:23,911 --> 00:45:24,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I didn't give you more warning.

717
00:45:25,552 --> 00:45:27,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Debuts of the week are basically... God damn it, we're pissed.

718
00:45:28,534 --> 00:45:29,495
[SPEAKER_05]: This stuff sucks.

719
00:45:29,835 --> 00:45:30,776
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna bitch about it.

720
00:45:31,036 --> 00:45:31,957
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can bitch with us.

721
00:45:32,617 --> 00:45:33,538
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll bitch on your behalf.

722
00:45:33,758 --> 00:45:34,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

723
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:36,120
[SPEAKER_05]: And we get neat theme music and you don't.

724
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Um... I gotta find your music.

725
00:45:41,544 --> 00:45:42,005
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is.

726
00:45:43,245 --> 00:45:43,566
[SPEAKER_07]: You ready?

727
00:45:43,786 --> 00:45:44,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

728
00:45:51,892 --> 00:45:52,773
[SPEAKER_24]: This is fucked up.

729
00:45:52,953 --> 00:45:53,133
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

730
00:45:54,094 --> 00:45:54,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

731
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:59,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, first fuck you of the week goes to Rob for having tomorrow off.

732
00:45:59,729 --> 00:46:01,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you, bitch!

733
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:02,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitch, don't make me cut you.

734
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:03,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I will.

735
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:05,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Come over there and beat your ass, woman.

736
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:07,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be kicking your ass so hard you'd be tasting rubber.

737
00:46:07,992 --> 00:46:09,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna kick your ass right back to the kitchen.

738
00:46:11,854 --> 00:46:12,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

739
00:46:12,714 --> 00:46:13,795
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck ever.

740
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:14,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

741
00:46:15,896 --> 00:46:19,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, my work doesn't believe in racial equality.

742
00:46:20,899 --> 00:46:25,761
[SPEAKER_05]: So, they do not celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.'

743
00:46:25,681 --> 00:46:26,221
[SPEAKER_05]: 's birthday.

744
00:46:26,661 --> 00:46:27,061
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

745
00:46:27,082 --> 00:46:29,763
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they just want us all to work a lot.

746
00:46:30,703 --> 00:46:34,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, fuck the faceplate on my CD player.

747
00:46:35,605 --> 00:46:37,466
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just going to be responsible and take my faceplate off.

748
00:46:38,726 --> 00:46:40,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I put the thing back on and now the buttons aren't lined up.

749
00:46:41,307 --> 00:46:47,011
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, it'll like, whenever I go over a bump or something, the faceplate will get, you know, mal-aligned or something.

750
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:51,413
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I have to like, hit my CD player to get the faceplate back on and then unpause it.

751
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:54,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it'll like, hit the pause button and then turn down the volume all the way.

752
00:46:55,216 --> 00:46:56,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's a faceplate.

753
00:46:56,737 --> 00:46:57,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what's that, Ran?

754
00:46:57,977 --> 00:46:58,358
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it?

755
00:46:58,378 --> 00:47:00,919
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you have, Rob?

756
00:47:00,959 --> 00:47:01,480
[SPEAKER_25]: Jensen.

757
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:06,123
What is it?

758
00:47:06,263 --> 00:47:07,443
[SPEAKER_04]: I need a two-piece CD player.

759
00:47:07,503 --> 00:47:08,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I can actually hold it.

760
00:47:10,506 --> 00:47:11,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry everyone.

761
00:47:11,606 --> 00:47:12,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got this shit still in here anyway.

762
00:47:13,707 --> 00:47:14,508
[SPEAKER_19]: You've verped on it.

763
00:47:16,368 --> 00:47:20,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, fuck Losing My Voice, which I did.

764
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:22,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck Denny's, okay?

765
00:47:22,671 --> 00:47:26,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck Denny's, TGI Fridays, and Lions.

766
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:33,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Last night after the show, and it was by the way, the Lions that, um, my drinking buddy.

767
00:47:33,335 --> 00:47:33,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

768
00:47:33,795 --> 00:47:36,236
[SPEAKER_05]: It was closed.

769
00:47:36,756 --> 00:47:37,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck it.

770
00:47:37,882 --> 00:47:40,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, they're not open anymore.

771
00:47:40,604 --> 00:47:41,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss him, though.

772
00:47:41,285 --> 00:47:44,748
[SPEAKER_05]: We went to the Denny's, the one that's on Hell, okay?

773
00:47:45,308 --> 00:47:49,252
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a sign on their door that said, we're closed due to maintenance.

774
00:47:49,272 --> 00:47:50,393
[SPEAKER_05]: And there were fucking people in there.

775
00:47:51,474 --> 00:47:51,894
[SPEAKER_05]: The fucks?

776
00:47:53,255 --> 00:47:57,038
[SPEAKER_05]: We go to teach our Fridays because they have that late night weekend deal.

777
00:47:57,559 --> 00:47:58,340
[SPEAKER_05]: They were closed.

778
00:47:59,340 --> 00:47:59,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitches.

779
00:48:01,022 --> 00:48:02,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob's about to bring more candy.

780
00:48:04,063 --> 00:48:13,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, fuck not having my animal across the town for two weeks, but Dan's gonna go retrieve it for me, but thank, very nice thank you to Amy for keeping our village happy.

781
00:48:15,051 --> 00:48:17,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, although I'll probably have cockroaches living under my bonfire.

782
00:48:18,253 --> 00:48:20,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, cause my house is a shrine to fire.

783
00:48:20,995 --> 00:48:32,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, fuck, um, not wanting to go to the convention today and missing me to see my man, but hey, I got 20 bucks back, so it's cool.

784
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:40,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Waffle Square was really nice, but fuck them for putting butter on my English muffins, and I had to get them taken back.

785
00:48:42,343 --> 00:48:43,823
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, fuck my shoes.

786
00:48:45,064 --> 00:48:45,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Again.

787
00:48:46,224 --> 00:48:53,286
[SPEAKER_05]: My new Vans are really awesome and comfy, but they, like, slip loose on my heel, and then the tongue is one of those super thick, cushy ones.

788
00:48:54,147 --> 00:48:57,908
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, um, um, I think...

789
00:49:01,169 --> 00:49:01,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I needed that.

790
00:49:02,049 --> 00:49:02,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

791
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:06,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I have to go get cross-trainer shoes or I'll be able to get some escape rations just to wear to the gym.

792
00:49:07,052 --> 00:49:11,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was on the exercise bike and my feet went numb because of my shoes.

793
00:49:12,954 --> 00:49:13,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let's see.

794
00:49:15,215 --> 00:49:17,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Another fuck you goes to, um...

795
00:49:19,568 --> 00:49:24,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Me, for only being able to last 12 minutes on the elliptical trainer, but I'm building up to it.

796
00:49:25,492 --> 00:49:31,115
[SPEAKER_05]: It also, uh, another question goes to me for stepping from the hot senior gym to go into the freezing cold outside.

797
00:49:31,475 --> 00:49:33,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Get the microphone out of the crotch, okay?

798
00:49:34,277 --> 00:49:34,857
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

799
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:36,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob's pumping the microphone now.

800
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:41,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, but... Jamie's getting a call!

801
00:49:41,802 --> 00:49:43,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, take a call live on air.

802
00:49:45,064 --> 00:49:45,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, I'll pause the music.

803
00:49:45,964 --> 00:49:46,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

804
00:49:48,303 --> 00:49:50,485
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking to you and I've got the microphone right now.

805
00:49:50,565 --> 00:49:51,045
[SPEAKER_05]: We're live.

806
00:49:53,987 --> 00:49:54,787
[SPEAKER_05]: You're heading over right now?

807
00:49:56,268 --> 00:49:56,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

808
00:49:57,429 --> 00:49:59,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been holding the speaker up to the thing.

809
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Say something to the listeners.

810
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:06,474
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't hear that.

811
00:50:07,194 --> 00:50:07,915
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't hear you.

812
00:50:08,735 --> 00:50:13,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, because I don't have the phone that has like 20 million decibels or something.

813
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:15,499
[SPEAKER_05]: So, head on over.

814
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,421
[SPEAKER_05]: We're doing fuck yous right now.

815
00:50:18,542 --> 00:50:20,103
[SPEAKER_05]: We're doing the fuck yous of the week right now.

816
00:50:21,164 --> 00:50:22,265
[SPEAKER_19]: Great radio right here.

817
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:23,406
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll save one for you, okay?

818
00:50:24,547 --> 00:50:25,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, come on over.

819
00:50:25,828 --> 00:50:26,649
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all getting drunk.

820
00:50:26,869 --> 00:50:27,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, Rob is.

821
00:50:28,851 --> 00:50:29,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, see you in a few.

822
00:50:30,812 --> 00:50:31,132
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

823
00:50:31,693 --> 00:50:35,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas went for like 45 minutes last week with his fuck you.

824
00:50:35,136 --> 00:50:36,597
[SPEAKER_07]: He gets two.

825
00:50:36,637 --> 00:50:37,278
[SPEAKER_07]: He's quoted.

826
00:50:37,318 --> 00:50:39,600
[SPEAKER_07]: He gets two fuck yous, that's it.

827
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

828
00:50:40,721 --> 00:50:41,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I was still doing my thing.

829
00:50:41,561 --> 00:50:42,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

830
00:50:42,482 --> 00:50:43,643
[SPEAKER_07]: I paused that for your phone call.

831
00:50:43,663 --> 00:50:43,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

832
00:50:44,123 --> 00:50:44,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well...

833
00:50:46,429 --> 00:50:50,753
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have to say fuck you to my boys, except I think that right now my boys look really fucking cool.

834
00:50:51,914 --> 00:50:56,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Except I can't, like, sing in the car with my new CD player.

835
00:50:57,438 --> 00:51:01,582
[SPEAKER_05]: And it sucks because I like holding, I hate people being off key.

836
00:51:02,402 --> 00:51:05,505
[SPEAKER_05]: And I try my hardest to stay on key and I just can't keep my voice down.

837
00:51:06,285 --> 00:51:07,767
[SPEAKER_05]: And it hurts my musician's pride.

838
00:51:08,287 --> 00:51:09,168
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me have a fit.

839
00:51:11,241 --> 00:51:18,004
[SPEAKER_05]: and fuck you to that person who I got a picture of the car like mine from for not allowing remote leaking.

840
00:51:18,644 --> 00:51:19,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you.

841
00:51:19,725 --> 00:51:22,946
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

842
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:25,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.

843
00:51:25,227 --> 00:51:25,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

844
00:51:26,308 --> 00:51:27,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm going to pass the microphone.

845
00:51:27,988 --> 00:51:28,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Loki's turn.

846
00:51:31,184 --> 00:51:33,666
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to think that I always have a lot of things to sing about.

847
00:51:33,726 --> 00:51:35,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I'm kind of tired right now.

848
00:51:35,867 --> 00:51:39,170
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not very angsty, but I have a couple things.

849
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,271
[SPEAKER_08]: First one goes to Lustketchup.

850
00:51:42,011 --> 00:51:45,274
[SPEAKER_08]: You unoriginal bitches need to get your own song and own dance steps.

851
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:46,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop ripping off of other people.

852
00:51:47,115 --> 00:51:47,875
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that dance.

853
00:51:48,016 --> 00:51:48,836
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a hand jive.

854
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:51,618
[SPEAKER_08]: It was back in the 60s or 50s, whenever the fuck it was.

855
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:54,080
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in the... Whatever is in the fucking...

856
00:51:55,441 --> 00:51:58,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but the dance, the whole movie took place back in the 50s or 60s, so there.

857
00:51:59,584 --> 00:52:02,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, so, the whole dance is the stupid hand jive.

858
00:52:02,585 --> 00:52:05,447
[SPEAKER_08]: And your stupid song, you know, Rapper's Delight, yeah, we know it.

859
00:52:05,507 --> 00:52:07,628
[SPEAKER_08]: So you butchered it with stupid, you know, Spanish lyrics.

860
00:52:07,648 --> 00:52:12,511
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you can go fuck yourselves and go prostitute yourselves like every other failing artist out there.

861
00:52:12,571 --> 00:52:13,612
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, bye.

862
00:52:14,452 --> 00:52:18,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, the second nephew goes to the freaking DDR Extreme Machine for freezing up.

863
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:22,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Konami, seriously, you need to make something that works right the first time.

864
00:52:22,918 --> 00:52:24,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Something that's not messed up in any sort of way.

865
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I don't know, have you ever heard of, I don't know, testing your fucking shit?

866
00:52:29,945 --> 00:52:35,052
[SPEAKER_08]: You tested it for like a couple weeks now, why didn't you catch this shit when it, you know, originally had it?

867
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:36,594
[SPEAKER_08]: What the fuck is this?!

868
00:52:38,777 --> 00:52:40,019
[SPEAKER_21]: Take this shit off, now!

869
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:53,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, um, no he doesn't get a fuck you, that was just, that was comedic timing because I wasn't paying attention to it.

870
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki doesn't want to fuck me, he doesn't swing that way.

871
00:52:55,828 --> 00:52:56,829
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't swing that way.

872
00:52:57,929 --> 00:53:00,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, what's up my homies?

873
00:53:02,532 --> 00:53:03,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey people.

874
00:53:05,017 --> 00:53:06,458
[SPEAKER_07]: We got more people to join in drinking.

875
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:07,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, finish up, Loki.

876
00:53:07,419 --> 00:53:08,841
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll introduce the guests soon.

877
00:53:08,861 --> 00:53:15,147
[SPEAKER_08]: So, F you to stupid drivers because I hate you and you just won't die like I want you to.

878
00:53:15,787 --> 00:53:20,071
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I figure if you're dumb enough to freaking drive the way you do, I'm surprised you haven't gotten accidents yet.

879
00:53:21,112 --> 00:53:24,816
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to the stupid script on my website for not working all this week.

880
00:53:25,096 --> 00:53:27,778
[SPEAKER_08]: But at least we've got that finally working, so that's not a big deal anymore.

881
00:53:28,819 --> 00:53:30,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, let's see here.

882
00:53:30,621 --> 00:53:36,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Effie is a stupid kid to look at me trying to figure out what I'm doing on the DDR pad.

883
00:53:36,807 --> 00:53:40,551
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're too dumb to realize what the hell a game is, then you shouldn't be in an arcade.

884
00:53:41,432 --> 00:53:41,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Go away.

885
00:53:41,973 --> 00:53:42,873
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just really nice.

886
00:53:43,995 --> 00:53:45,356
[SPEAKER_08]: There's lots of Akuma Hall there.

887
00:53:46,817 --> 00:53:48,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, keep going, keep going.

888
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:49,921
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't, there's too many distractions!

889
00:53:53,078 --> 00:53:54,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there's peer pressure!

890
00:53:54,779 --> 00:53:57,460
[SPEAKER_08]: No, freaking, um... I don't know.

891
00:53:58,121 --> 00:53:59,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really have much.

892
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:00,242
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm done.

893
00:54:00,562 --> 00:54:00,862
[SPEAKER_08]: For now.

894
00:54:00,942 --> 00:54:03,083
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure I'll think of more later to complain about.

895
00:54:04,044 --> 00:54:05,384
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I'm done for now.

896
00:54:05,705 --> 00:54:06,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

897
00:54:06,885 --> 00:54:07,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki's done.

898
00:54:07,706 --> 00:54:08,346
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done for now.

899
00:54:08,426 --> 00:54:09,827
[SPEAKER_07]: You spent... For now.

900
00:54:10,427 --> 00:54:11,448
[SPEAKER_07]: The keyword is for now.

901
00:54:12,528 --> 00:54:13,048
[SPEAKER_07]: My turn.

902
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:16,950
[SPEAKER_07]: My first fuck you goes to Butterscotch Schnapps for fucking me up.

903
00:54:22,183 --> 00:54:22,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's great.

904
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:27,746
[SPEAKER_07]: My second FU goes to Brad, because Brad's got cool hair tonight.

905
00:54:28,026 --> 00:54:28,806
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

906
00:54:30,207 --> 00:54:32,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to bend over, Brad.

907
00:54:32,308 --> 00:54:32,768
[SPEAKER_07]: You're mine.

908
00:54:32,868 --> 00:54:33,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.

909
00:54:36,707 --> 00:54:40,249
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

910
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:07,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Irene looks pretty hot too.

911
00:55:07,441 --> 00:55:09,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Irene's like wearing a giant fishnet.

912
00:55:11,086 --> 00:55:11,686
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cute.

913
00:55:12,548 --> 00:55:15,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna... Oh, you're gonna suck me?

914
00:55:15,531 --> 00:55:15,772
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

915
00:55:19,127 --> 00:55:21,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, welcome to the drunk episode of Orange Ones.

916
00:55:21,928 --> 00:55:26,129
[SPEAKER_07]: My other FUs go to people that don't call you back.

917
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:28,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already done that one before, I think.

918
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:36,093
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate dating people that just want to fuck you on the first date and then you don't put out so they don't call you.

919
00:55:36,153 --> 00:55:36,913
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate that shit.

920
00:55:37,433 --> 00:55:40,814
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um... Fuck them in their nose.

921
00:55:41,315 --> 00:55:41,775
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um...

922
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:54,091
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to, uh, um, Drama, Stop Causing Drama, I Hate You, um, I don't know what else, that's it.

923
00:55:54,291 --> 00:55:55,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, drink some more.

924
00:55:55,392 --> 00:55:59,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Drink some more, I will in a minute, I don't have any, I'm not that, I'm all F you'd out today.

925
00:55:59,936 --> 00:56:01,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's read the chatroom's F you's.

926
00:56:02,987 --> 00:56:07,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm going to read the FUs for the chat room real fast.

927
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:12,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on real fast, let me find some appropriate music.

928
00:56:13,267 --> 00:56:13,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here we go.

929
00:56:16,385 --> 00:56:18,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, wait, wait, I have to say something about Animal Crossing.

930
00:56:19,147 --> 00:56:20,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki's town is in.

931
00:56:20,388 --> 00:56:23,169
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go visit Loki's town again, though, another villager's going to move.

932
00:56:23,209 --> 00:56:24,110
[SPEAKER_07]: We already had one move.

933
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:25,331
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you have a game cube now?

934
00:56:25,871 --> 00:56:26,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Take out his card.

935
00:56:27,432 --> 00:56:29,474
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in slot B. Ricky moved, though.

936
00:56:29,514 --> 00:56:30,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Ricky's an asshole, so it's fine.

937
00:56:31,775 --> 00:56:33,336
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in slot A, and it says Batston on it.

938
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:36,458
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if... Yes, just remove the card in slot B. Okay, anyway, hi.

939
00:56:36,858 --> 00:56:37,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, yes.

940
00:56:37,219 --> 00:56:37,419
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

941
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:41,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Rob, try this drink.

942
00:56:41,461 --> 00:56:42,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, no, hold on.

943
00:56:42,522 --> 00:56:43,923
[SPEAKER_07]: What, what, eww, what is it?

944
00:56:44,163 --> 00:56:45,444
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks disgusting.

945
00:56:46,064 --> 00:56:47,465
[SPEAKER_09]: What's in it?

946
00:56:47,945 --> 00:56:48,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Spiced melon.

947
00:56:48,606 --> 00:56:49,947
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like puke.

948
00:56:50,027 --> 00:56:50,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Spicy melon.

949
00:56:53,008 --> 00:56:53,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Chug, chug, chug.

950
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:58,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Woo!

951
00:57:00,313 --> 00:57:01,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Describe the burning flavor.

952
00:57:03,135 --> 00:57:03,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Ow!

953
00:57:07,248 --> 00:57:09,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, that shit is nasty.

954
00:57:09,469 --> 00:57:11,930
[SPEAKER_07]: What, bitch, what'd you do to that?

955
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:13,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Goldslide Grimidory.

956
00:57:14,331 --> 00:57:15,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god!

957
00:57:17,532 --> 00:57:18,612
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't go hand in hand.

958
00:57:19,292 --> 00:57:20,873
[SPEAKER_09]: It tastes like cum.

959
00:57:22,614 --> 00:57:23,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

960
00:57:23,834 --> 00:57:25,615
[SPEAKER_09]: You're being rather nice to call it that.

961
00:57:27,135 --> 00:57:28,536
[SPEAKER_09]: It tastes like fruity cum.

962
00:57:30,345 --> 00:57:32,406
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to get another random shot for Rob.

963
00:57:32,646 --> 00:57:33,446
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've heard.

964
00:57:33,886 --> 00:57:37,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, is that like, you know, remember back on, um, when I was a guest on Understation Live?

965
00:57:37,448 --> 00:57:37,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

966
00:57:37,528 --> 00:57:38,608
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking about those pills?

967
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:39,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

968
00:57:39,249 --> 00:57:41,770
[SPEAKER_05]: That you take that flavors your... Yes, it's like that.

969
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:42,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

970
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:44,051
[SPEAKER_05]: It tastes like cunt.

971
00:57:45,991 --> 00:57:49,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I'm trying to find the song I wanted to play for, um, the chat rooms, FUs.

972
00:57:49,853 --> 00:57:50,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, I'm looking.

973
00:57:52,274 --> 00:57:54,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Fill some space, you guys, while I look for the...

974
00:57:57,034 --> 00:57:58,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God, I feel like I got a verb.

975
00:58:00,496 --> 00:58:00,996
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

976
00:58:01,956 --> 00:58:11,561
[SPEAKER_15]: Vanilla rum.

977
00:58:11,581 --> 00:58:13,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I'm trying to find, hold on, I've got it.

978
00:58:13,602 --> 00:58:16,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here's the song I wanted to use for Chatroom Refuse, because I hate this song.

979
00:58:18,384 --> 00:58:21,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the chatroom, starting with... Muheimer.

980
00:58:21,546 --> 00:58:22,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Muheimer.

981
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:31,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck the friggin' virus going around my damn school that was caught by my now-infected body and it forced me to miss a day of exams which had to be made up Tuesday.

982
00:58:31,442 --> 00:58:31,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Roar.

983
00:58:32,303 --> 00:58:36,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I still say fuck those damn pink and purple candy Valentine's Day hearts for ruining my bag.

984
00:58:36,928 --> 00:58:39,750
[SPEAKER_07]: And fuck the Orange Lounge site for still not having the cast section done.

985
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:41,212
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to be the good stalker, which I am.

986
00:58:41,772 --> 00:58:43,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck... Hold on a minute.

987
00:58:43,594 --> 00:58:44,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck your medicine, rather.

988
00:58:44,815 --> 00:58:45,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck cough medicine.

989
00:58:45,876 --> 00:58:47,017
[SPEAKER_07]: And fuck the Eagles hype.

990
00:58:48,498 --> 00:58:52,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, fuck being sick, because I've been sick all week.

991
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:53,000
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate it.

992
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck.

993
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:54,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck.

994
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:57,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

995
00:58:57,881 --> 00:59:01,242
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting FUs for DDR Angel relayed through 23rd Magus.

996
00:59:01,602 --> 00:59:04,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Massive FU to the coworkers who call in sick in the last minute.

997
00:59:04,523 --> 00:59:06,864
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why she's not here tonight, and she's at work.

998
00:59:07,724 --> 00:59:23,208
[SPEAKER_07]: 23 Magus has an FU to Angel's co-workers who call in sick at the last minute, an FU to Windows Media Player 9 for not supporting MP4s, and QuickTime for being the only player that'll support MP4s, the economy-sized FU to not having a car, and massive fucking FU to six teachers who give out term papers at the last minute.

999
00:59:23,248 --> 00:59:23,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Die, bitches.

1000
00:59:24,268 --> 00:59:27,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I want all your balls to die, and I will supply the Stabity Death.

1001
00:59:28,009 --> 00:59:28,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Calm me down.

1002
00:59:29,169 --> 00:59:31,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I also want to send an FU to Hydra, because I can't.

1003
00:59:33,946 --> 00:59:39,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, our Drama Queen twin says, I'm going to get a private message for that.

1004
00:59:40,108 --> 00:59:42,989
[SPEAKER_07]: A few to Martin Luther King Day on my birthday once again.

1005
00:59:43,489 --> 00:59:44,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Loki.

1006
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:46,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Play that Secret Survivor song I sent you.

1007
00:59:50,814 --> 00:59:51,314
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a secret.

1008
00:59:51,334 --> 00:59:52,015
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a secret.

1009
00:59:52,315 --> 00:59:53,635
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a secret rendezvous.

1010
00:59:53,655 --> 00:59:55,956
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm saving it for, yeah, the section.

1011
00:59:56,136 --> 00:59:57,457
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a secret rendezvous.

1012
00:59:57,597 --> 00:59:59,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you having a secret rendezvous with Twin?

1013
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:01,559
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not having a secret rendezvous.

1014
01:00:01,939 --> 01:00:10,883
[SPEAKER_08]: I was contacting DJ Ranma because he's the guy that's sort of doing the webmastering stuff for my site, and he only has access to DJ Ranma, and he was fixing my script.

1015
01:00:11,243 --> 01:00:16,765
[SPEAKER_08]: And so every time I'm on AOL, or AIM actually, Twin would come up and chat with me a little bit.

1016
01:00:18,786 --> 01:00:21,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to get a twin before you send me that PM.

1017
01:00:21,607 --> 01:00:22,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm drunk.

1018
01:00:22,107 --> 01:00:23,228
[SPEAKER_07]: It's liquor talking, all right?

1019
01:00:23,368 --> 01:00:24,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1020
01:00:25,549 --> 01:00:30,311
[SPEAKER_07]: NoStylin says... All right, when's Brad going to start drinking?

1021
01:00:38,834 --> 01:00:39,274
[SPEAKER_07]: How is it?

1022
01:00:42,255 --> 01:00:43,476
[SPEAKER_07]: It tastes like peach urine.

1023
01:00:44,016 --> 01:00:44,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Peach urine?

1024
01:00:45,737 --> 01:00:46,697
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I had that problem earlier.

1025
01:00:48,927 --> 01:00:49,708
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta pee.

1026
01:00:51,788 --> 01:00:57,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Nostylan says, no more mixed drinks, give me a minute.

1027
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:59,211
[SPEAKER_07]: There goes all my liquor.

1028
01:00:59,391 --> 01:01:00,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to calm down.

1029
01:01:00,751 --> 01:01:03,352
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to put the car in park and stop for a minute.

1030
01:01:04,612 --> 01:01:05,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be feeding me more.

1031
01:01:05,773 --> 01:01:07,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Nostylan, what's up?

1032
01:01:08,153 --> 01:01:09,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Nostylan, bud.

1033
01:01:12,255 --> 01:01:14,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shit, don't spill the drinks.

1034
01:01:14,775 --> 01:01:16,176
[SPEAKER_07]: God, god damn.

1035
01:01:17,438 --> 01:01:17,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Hot damn!

1036
01:01:18,058 --> 01:01:18,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh shit!

1037
01:01:19,139 --> 01:01:20,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Nostylin's window closed.

1038
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:20,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Where is it?

1039
01:01:21,681 --> 01:01:24,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Nostylin.

1040
01:01:24,623 --> 01:01:26,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time I think of Nostylin, I think of this song.

1041
01:01:26,484 --> 01:01:27,885
[SPEAKER_07]: We need Ritalin.

1042
01:01:28,005 --> 01:01:32,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna get beat up for that.

1043
01:01:32,548 --> 01:01:34,149
[SPEAKER_07]: This should be the last shot for a while.

1044
01:01:34,469 --> 01:01:35,530
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to breathe!

1045
01:01:37,511 --> 01:01:40,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Nostylin says the fuck me of the week is fuck dogs!

1046
01:01:40,574 --> 01:01:41,514
[SPEAKER_07]: They chew on everything.

1047
01:01:41,974 --> 01:01:42,435
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

1048
01:01:42,495 --> 01:01:43,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck dogs.

1049
01:01:44,516 --> 01:01:46,858
[SPEAKER_07]: And fuck people who don't share files.

1050
01:01:50,197 --> 01:01:52,779
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck, what'd you do, you stupid bitch?

1051
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:55,080
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, don't be so mean to me.

1052
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:55,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you, Jamie.

1053
01:01:55,941 --> 01:01:56,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me a hug.

1054
01:01:56,561 --> 01:01:56,981
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you.

1055
01:01:57,141 --> 01:01:57,982
[SPEAKER_07]: You're my homie.

1056
01:01:58,282 --> 01:02:00,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna fall, but you're my homie.

1057
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:01,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob had to drink.

1058
01:02:01,024 --> 01:02:01,924
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not even that much.

1059
01:02:03,265 --> 01:02:03,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me that.

1060
01:02:03,906 --> 01:02:04,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1061
01:02:04,266 --> 01:02:06,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone take your money.

1062
01:02:06,127 --> 01:02:06,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob?

1063
01:02:06,987 --> 01:02:07,428
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1064
01:02:08,468 --> 01:02:08,809
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1065
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:09,569
Okay.

[SPEAKER_07]: Shane's my buddy from LiveJournal.

1069
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,654
[SPEAKER_07]: He responded to a post and I didn't see it for like a month.

1070
01:02:20,414 --> 01:02:24,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's the same guy, I'm assuming, because they were both named Shane.

1071
01:02:24,436 --> 01:02:25,756
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, finally I get to do FUs.

[SPEAKER_07]: www.understandationlive.org They own your soul.

1086
01:03:24,913 --> 01:03:25,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I bite my lip?

1087
01:03:27,055 --> 01:03:27,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I did.

1088
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,959
[SPEAKER_05]: What's wrong with my lip?

1089
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:35,081
[SPEAKER_05]: You're chewing it.

1090
01:03:36,922 --> 01:03:37,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo, SFBB.

01:03:43,004 --> 01:03:50,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you to going somewhere and realizing you forgot your wallet, but it was worth it to go back and get it, though I was embarrassed Baja Fresh was way worth it.

1093
01:03:50,905 --> 01:03:53,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you to all those Oolong haters from last week.

1094
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,186
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree, Oolong Bunny is the shit.

1095
01:03:55,526 --> 01:03:56,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you.

01:03:57,347 --> 01:04:00,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, for the drunkenness episode, could you do a list list of schnapps flavors?

1097
01:04:00,827 --> 01:04:02,288
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we have another list list on tap.

1098
01:04:03,248 --> 01:04:06,128

1101
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:20,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I usually, I don't read personal FUs, but since 23rd Magus said FU to Hydra, I don't.

1102
01:04:20,943 --> 01:04:21,624
[SPEAKER_07]: That's karma, bitch.

1103
01:04:22,884 --> 01:04:25,446

[SPEAKER_07]: And he puts up with those Thursday, uh, things never happening.

1116
01:04:56,503 --> 01:04:57,043
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Enya.

1117
01:04:57,063 --> 01:04:57,963
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes me want to barf.

1118
01:04:58,923 --> 01:05:02,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Chubbs, my bro, says, fuck myself for not being able to be there.

1119

[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

1122
01:05:06,807 --> 01:05:10,649
[SPEAKER_07]: We wouldn't want to fuck Chubbs anyway because he doesn't swing that way, but, you know.

1123
01:05:12,631 --> 01:05:15,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, F you to Jack in the Box for getting rid of the Westerner.

01:09:48,849 --> 01:09:50,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, are you coherent?

1218
01:09:51,752 --> 01:09:52,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you gonna drink, Brad?

1219
01:09:53,234 --> 01:09:54,155
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have a shot or two.

1220
01:09:54,355 --> 01:09:55,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make you a shot.

1221
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:57,531
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I just want some Goldschlager.

1222
01:09:57,831 --> 01:09:59,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make you a normal one, I promise.

1223
01:09:59,211 --> 01:10:00,011
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make you a normal one.

1224
01:10:00,171 --> 01:10:01,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I just want some Goldschlager.

1225
01:10:01,872 --> 01:10:02,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I really gotta pee.

1226
01:10:02,512 --> 01:10:04,553
[SPEAKER_07]: If I run to the bathroom, do you guys want to take the show over?

1227
01:10:04,573 --> 01:10:05,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat room!

1228
01:10:05,653 --> 01:10:07,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, you guys want to take the show over?

1229
01:10:07,174 --> 01:10:07,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

1230
01:10:07,774 --> 01:10:08,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Get back with a wet paper towel.

1231
01:10:09,014 --> 01:10:10,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Get a wet paper towel so we can clean that shit up.

1232
01:10:11,335 --> 01:10:11,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

1233
01:10:11,675 --> 01:10:11,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1234
01:10:12,015 --> 01:10:13,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Rob is... Okay.

1235
01:10:14,207 --> 01:10:15,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob's trying to make out with Brad.

1236
01:10:15,168 --> 01:10:16,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody rang the doorbell.

1237
01:10:16,729 --> 01:10:18,811
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Jonas is here.

1238
01:10:19,251 --> 01:10:19,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, chat room.

1239
01:10:20,672 --> 01:10:22,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, best show ever, my ass.

1240
01:10:22,974 --> 01:10:23,215
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1241
01:10:23,255 --> 01:10:24,936
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1242
01:10:25,056 --> 01:10:25,677
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my turn.

1243
01:10:26,898 --> 01:10:29,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, well, did you have more fuck you's, Brad?

1244
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,961
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I've had my fuck you's.

1245
01:10:31,441 --> 01:10:31,902
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1246
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's time right now that we go to a break.

1247
01:10:36,422 --> 01:10:39,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, let's go to a break so I can clean this shit up that Rob's filled.

1248
01:10:40,123 --> 01:10:45,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm going to find files and I have no idea where any of Rob's stuff is.

1249
01:10:47,026 --> 01:10:47,987
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to take a moment.

1250
01:10:48,467 --> 01:10:50,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I can hear Rob screaming out there.

1251
01:10:50,608 --> 01:10:52,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob just said shit really loud, by the way.

1252
01:10:54,349 --> 01:10:55,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, don't run.

1253
01:10:55,309 --> 01:10:56,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, don't run.

1254
01:10:56,510 --> 01:10:58,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to pee in somebody's bathroom.

1255
01:10:58,511 --> 01:11:00,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Use Brooklyn's bathroom.

1256
01:11:00,831 --> 01:11:02,732
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to play some songs, yeah.

1257
01:11:03,032 --> 01:11:06,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to pick some random stuff.

1258
01:11:06,754 --> 01:11:07,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1259
01:11:07,674 --> 01:11:09,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Matt, do your job.

1260
01:11:10,075 --> 01:11:12,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just picking stuff out of this random directory.

1261
01:11:13,396 --> 01:11:14,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll pick really bad music.

1262
01:11:15,417 --> 01:11:18,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we'll play some bad music in a minute.

1263
01:11:18,398 --> 01:11:20,679
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the meantime, here's everyone's favorite vocalists.

1264
01:11:20,899 --> 01:11:21,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo!

1265
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:23,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's run!

1266
01:11:23,991 --> 01:11:34,344
[SPEAKER_13]: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,

1267
01:11:41,312 --> 01:11:41,933
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's get it, Bob!

1268
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:05,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

1269
01:12:35,754 --> 01:12:36,454
Thank you!

1270
01:12:36,474 --> 01:12:36,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you!

1271
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:03,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

1272
01:13:54,315 --> 01:13:54,996
Thank you for watching

1273
01:14:20,525 --> 01:14:21,085
[SPEAKER_01]: and many more.

1274
01:16:21,581 --> 01:16:29,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Me, Me, Quack, Quack, Ho, Ho, Ho Quack, Quack, Me, Ho, Me, Me, Ho, Ho, Me, Ho Me, Me, Quack, Quack, Ho, Ho, Ho Quack, La, Me, Quack, Ho

1275
01:16:45,457 --> 01:16:46,298
[SPEAKER_22]: L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L

1276
01:16:59,179 --> 01:17:00,479
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for watching!

1277
01:17:24,113 --> 01:17:31,556
[SPEAKER_15]: Me, me, me, me, oh, oh, oh Me, me, me, oh, me, oh Me, me, me, oh, oh, oh Me, me, me, oh, oh, oh

1278
01:17:49,301 --> 01:17:50,002
[SPEAKER_22]: L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L

1279
01:18:02,982 --> 01:18:04,143
[SPEAKER_22]: and many more.

1280
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:32,462
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, this is Melby of RTF.

1281
01:18:32,482 --> 01:18:36,624
[SPEAKER_22]: For an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Melby can join us on all the fun together.

1282
01:18:45,865 --> 01:18:51,827
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

1283
01:18:51,847 --> 01:18:54,048
[SPEAKER_20]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

1284
01:18:54,628 --> 01:18:58,670
[SPEAKER_20]: Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

1285
01:18:59,831 --> 01:19:01,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Rob's fucked up.

1286
01:19:01,871 --> 01:19:08,974
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura has taken over the command center because I don't want to drive drunk, ladies and gentlemen.

1287
01:19:09,694 --> 01:19:13,536
[SPEAKER_09]: We need a designated, uh, radio personality.

1288
01:19:14,506 --> 01:19:15,606
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm designated.

1289
01:19:17,627 --> 01:19:20,668
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we going to talk about, you designated diva?

1290
01:19:20,688 --> 01:19:25,189
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to do the list list, and I'll give you the chair back if you promise to type responsibly.

1291
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:28,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, let's talk about something else.

1292
01:19:29,171 --> 01:19:30,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas is in the house!

1293
01:19:31,711 --> 01:19:32,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi!

1294
01:19:32,432 --> 01:19:33,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey!

1295
01:19:33,192 --> 01:19:35,973
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not allowed to do FUs this week, though.

1296
01:19:36,013 --> 01:19:38,234
[SPEAKER_07]: You did like three weeks worth last week.

1297
01:19:39,234 --> 01:19:40,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you can do one FU.

1298
01:19:40,774 --> 01:19:41,295
[SPEAKER_07]: You do one.

1299
01:19:42,255 --> 01:19:42,615
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1300
01:19:43,376 --> 01:19:46,097
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the one big F you right here, only one.

1301
01:19:47,338 --> 01:19:52,361
[SPEAKER_18]: To the asshole, you erased my damn GameCube, PS2, and Xbox memory cards.

1302
01:19:52,381 --> 01:19:57,023
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, but some asshole erased my files in there.

1303
01:19:57,043 --> 01:19:59,665
[SPEAKER_18]: 60 games saved.

1304
01:19:59,845 --> 01:20:00,385
[SPEAKER_18]: You fuck.

1305
01:20:01,286 --> 01:20:02,606
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not you, it's a guy.

1306
01:20:03,467 --> 01:20:04,507
[SPEAKER_18]: I like you, you're cool.

1307
01:20:05,008 --> 01:20:07,269
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, whoever did this, fuck you.

1308
01:20:07,629 --> 01:20:12,792
[SPEAKER_18]: Nothing says fuck you more than me giving you an ass kicking if I found out who the hell you are.

1309
01:20:22,591 --> 01:20:22,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

1310
01:20:23,632 --> 01:20:24,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Jonas, what's up?

1311
01:20:25,193 --> 01:20:25,773
[SPEAKER_07]: That's your FU?

1312
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:27,295
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my only FU right now.

1313
01:20:27,755 --> 01:20:28,716
[SPEAKER_07]: So how you doing, brother?

1314
01:20:28,816 --> 01:20:29,316
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing?

1315
01:20:29,676 --> 01:20:30,237
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1316
01:20:31,057 --> 01:20:33,039
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to be able to drink with us tonight, that's a shame.

1317
01:20:33,559 --> 01:20:33,900
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh well.

1318
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:36,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh well.

1319
01:20:36,662 --> 01:20:38,063
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think of Extreme?

1320
01:20:39,384 --> 01:20:40,044
[SPEAKER_18]: Kicks ass.

1321
01:20:41,405 --> 01:20:42,646
[SPEAKER_18]: The hell it kicks ass.

1322
01:20:42,766 --> 01:20:44,888
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait, I got a question for future tournaments.

1323
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:50,232
[SPEAKER_18]: Would there be beginner mode allowed for freestyle?

1324
01:20:51,507 --> 01:20:54,010
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there should be a tournament or a beginner mode.

1325
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Beginner shuffle for improv.

1326
01:20:56,632 --> 01:21:00,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a weak improv tourney for white boys like myself.

1327
01:21:02,878 --> 01:21:07,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Where I can, like, rape the bar and do, like, vanilla ice dancing.

1328
01:21:09,284 --> 01:21:11,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1329
01:21:11,826 --> 01:21:13,688
[SPEAKER_07]: We're done with the FUs, you can kill the music, it's cool.

1330
01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:16,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm dizzy.

1331
01:21:16,631 --> 01:21:18,132
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, careful.

1332
01:21:18,152 --> 01:21:22,015
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't want to get too drunk.

1333
01:21:22,476 --> 01:21:24,237
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, you're already drunk?

1334
01:21:24,257 --> 01:21:25,118
[SPEAKER_18]: What the hell am I talking about?

1335
01:21:25,158 --> 01:21:30,963
[SPEAKER_18]: I just got here, and I found that people are already drinking eight shots of glass and so forth.

1336
01:21:31,684 --> 01:21:32,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I drink pussy.

1337
01:21:32,925 --> 01:21:34,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, I drank a pussy.

1338
01:21:35,167 --> 01:21:35,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear lord.

1339
01:21:36,618 --> 01:21:44,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I made the new nastiest shot ever, a combination of hot damn Goldschlager and Malibu, and I call it pussy, because it's pink like pussy.

1340
01:21:44,661 --> 01:21:52,203
[SPEAKER_07]: We should warn any new listeners listening tonight that this is not the normal Orange Lounge, because I'm drunk as shit.

1341
01:21:53,163 --> 01:21:54,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, guacamole del taco.

1342
01:21:54,384 --> 01:22:01,446
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not what we usually do on this show, although we could, except I usually work Mondays, but not this Monday, because Martin Luther King Jr.,

1343
01:22:04,608 --> 01:22:09,111
[SPEAKER_07]: is having a birthday tomorrow, even though he's dead, he's still having a birthday.

1344
01:22:09,131 --> 01:22:10,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm repeating my fuck you, Rob.

1345
01:22:11,012 --> 01:22:11,292
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1346
01:22:11,612 --> 01:22:11,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitch.

1347
01:22:12,212 --> 01:22:12,513
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1348
01:22:12,653 --> 01:22:12,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitch.

1349
01:22:12,993 --> 01:22:13,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, what?

1350
01:22:13,573 --> 01:22:14,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you.

1351
01:22:14,354 --> 01:22:15,174
[SPEAKER_07]: What did I do to you?

1352
01:22:15,715 --> 01:22:16,975
[SPEAKER_02]: What did I do to you?

1353
01:22:17,355 --> 01:22:19,076
[SPEAKER_04]: You have tomorrow off, bitch.

1354
01:22:19,537 --> 01:22:24,119
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I still gotta go to my, actually, no, you know what, that's not entirely true, because I'm going to my second job tomorrow.

1355
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:24,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yay.

1356
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,601
[SPEAKER_07]: So I probably won't go in until like 2 o'clock.

1357
01:22:26,621 --> 01:22:28,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, go play 2DX with me tomorrow.

1358
01:22:29,462 --> 01:22:30,363
[SPEAKER_07]: I kinda wanna.

1359
01:22:30,423 --> 01:22:31,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1360
01:22:31,023 --> 01:22:31,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1361
01:22:31,924 --> 01:22:33,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, we're doing a radio show, yeah.

1362
01:22:34,503 --> 01:22:36,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to do laundry tomorrow, but I have to go to the gym, too.

1363
01:22:36,724 --> 01:22:38,705
[SPEAKER_07]: What else is Bomani-related that we can talk about?

1364
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:39,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki!

1365
01:22:40,486 --> 01:22:41,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I dropped the microphone!

1366
01:22:43,327 --> 01:22:43,668
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1367
01:22:44,748 --> 01:22:44,928
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1368
01:22:44,988 --> 01:22:48,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I supposed to... Okay, I guess I gotta move to shore.

1369
01:22:50,051 --> 01:22:53,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let's see, what haven't I talked about yet?

1370
01:22:53,332 --> 01:22:57,695
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, I think we covered... Oh, of course.

1371
01:22:58,095 --> 01:22:59,375
[SPEAKER_08]: New Dance Mania coming out!

1380
01:23:19,441 --> 01:23:22,724
[SPEAKER_08]: But EX2, it's kind of weird, is they've got a bunch of new covers on there.

1381
01:23:22,944 --> 01:23:26,166
[SPEAKER_08]: They have Xtreme doing a cover of Long Train Run in this time around.

1384
01:23:33,612 --> 01:23:35,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, DJ Alligator Project.

1385
01:23:35,814 --> 01:23:36,955

[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, let's pull up the full list here.

[SPEAKER_05]: You can take the cock?

1393
01:24:07,947 --> 01:24:12,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob thinks he's not drunk.

1394
01:24:12,488 --> 01:24:13,509
[SPEAKER_09]: This is like a soap opera.

1395

[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, tell us about that disco special that was on ABC.

1427
01:26:17,257 --> 01:26:20,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I was at the gym, and I was bored, so I got on the NetBike.

1428
01:26:21,639 --> 01:26:23,459
[SPEAKER_05]: And, by the way, I didn't crash it this time.

1429
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:30,502
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on the NetPulse bike, and there was this disco special on ABC.

1430
01:26:30,522 --> 01:26:33,363
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like Disco House Party or something, but it was hosted by Whoopi Goldberg.

1431
01:26:33,963 --> 01:26:36,444
[SPEAKER_05]: And Paula, Rob, Paula Abdul was on it.

1432
01:26:37,612 --> 01:26:43,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but it was like, um, yeah, Paula Abdul was on that.

1433
01:26:43,276 --> 01:26:44,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Paula Terry?

1434
01:26:44,257 --> 01:26:44,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.

1435
01:26:44,698 --> 01:26:45,298
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Paula Abdul.

1436
01:26:45,318 --> 01:26:45,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's Brad.

1437
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:46,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's Brad.

1438
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:51,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but no, um, it was a pretty neat special, but I was only on the bike for 30 minutes.

1439
01:26:51,583 --> 01:26:52,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it.

1440
01:26:53,624 --> 01:26:56,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on the thing for 30, for 30 minutes because I was doing my warm-up.

1441
01:26:57,127 --> 01:26:58,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, because I go to the gym now.

1442
01:26:59,749 --> 01:27:00,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Chili's.

1443
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:00,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Um.

1444
01:27:01,385 --> 01:27:02,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, anyway.

1445
01:27:03,687 --> 01:27:07,249
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty cool because they played It's Rainin' Men.

1446
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:11,672
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was Whoopi Goldberg singing with this other, I think the lady who originally did it.

1447
01:27:12,072 --> 01:27:12,872
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember who it was.

1448
01:27:13,293 --> 01:27:14,774
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all these guys came down.

1449
01:27:14,994 --> 01:27:15,714
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Gloria Gaynor.

1450
01:27:16,755 --> 01:27:18,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Gloria Gaynor did I Will Survive.

1451
01:27:18,456 --> 01:27:19,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know.

1452
01:27:20,377 --> 01:27:23,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, they had, what was her name?

1453
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:24,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Nikki French?

1454
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:25,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that her name?

1455
01:27:26,321 --> 01:27:27,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Who did Total Eclipse of the Heart?

1456
01:27:29,262 --> 01:27:29,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sure.

1457
01:27:30,263 --> 01:27:34,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they had her come and sing Total Eclipse of the Heart, but it was all sped up and discally.

1458
01:27:35,545 --> 01:27:39,807
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they had Usher doing... Oh, God, what's that song?

1459
01:27:40,267 --> 01:27:49,251
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was really cool, because when he was out there singing it, he was wearing the little cap, and he was wearing Heelys and spinning around in it, and then they had all these people dancing on roller skates.

1460
01:27:49,411 --> 01:27:51,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Please tell me Usher did Dancing Queen.

1461
01:27:51,392 --> 01:27:55,013
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but a bunch of drag queens did Dancing Queen.

1462
01:27:55,714 --> 01:27:57,575
[SPEAKER_05]: That was fabulous.

1463
01:27:57,755 --> 01:27:58,175
[SPEAKER_05]: But no...

1464
01:28:00,093 --> 01:28:01,114
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the song that Usher did?

1465
01:28:01,194 --> 01:28:03,376
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now.

1466
01:28:03,836 --> 01:28:04,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was it.

1467
01:28:05,337 --> 01:28:10,482
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was really cool, and normally I don't like hearing him sing, but he did that song justice, so it was cool.

1468
01:28:11,403 --> 01:28:14,746
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just kind of neat watching everybody dance the roller skates, because I had a Xanadu moment.

1469
01:28:16,653 --> 01:28:18,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, everyone's cleared out of the studio.

1470
01:28:18,395 --> 01:28:18,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey!

1471
01:28:19,155 --> 01:28:21,417
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a really weird stench in this area here.

1472
01:28:21,477 --> 01:28:21,898
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Rob.

1473
01:28:22,578 --> 01:28:23,960
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the stench of drunk Rob.

1474
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:24,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1475
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Either that or it's my shoes, sorry.

1476
01:28:26,822 --> 01:28:27,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotta get used to that, man.

1477
01:28:28,003 --> 01:28:30,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Forget the department.

1478
01:28:30,606 --> 01:28:33,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, next week is not a drunk week.

1479
01:28:33,568 --> 01:28:33,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1480
01:28:36,485 --> 01:28:38,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man, I don't want to go to work tomorrow.

1481
01:28:39,227 --> 01:28:40,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Freaking A, they suck.

1482
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:48,094
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't give me anything to do at work, and I get all my work done, including all the busy work that I make for myself, and then they're like, oh sorry, you can't go and play on the internet.

1483
01:28:48,254 --> 01:28:50,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well what the hell am I supposed to do, stare at the wall?

1484
01:28:50,135 --> 01:28:52,797
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I've been doing for the last three days, is staring at the fucking wall.

1485
01:28:54,018 --> 01:28:54,738
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

1486
01:28:58,445 --> 01:29:01,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the best thing ever.

1487
01:29:03,128 --> 01:29:07,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say who it is, but one of our favorite people will take the cock.

1488
01:29:08,451 --> 01:29:09,172
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm going to say who.

1489
01:29:09,772 --> 01:29:10,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob left the show?

1490
01:29:12,974 --> 01:29:17,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it looks like it's just... You're our official... Get out of the chair!

1491
01:29:18,217 --> 01:29:18,978
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my chair!

1492
01:29:20,097 --> 01:29:25,501
[SPEAKER_07]: I quit to make room for Jahi because Jahi owns all and he's the new Lord of the Universe.

1493
01:29:25,681 --> 01:29:26,281
[SPEAKER_05]: You're fired.

1494
01:29:27,882 --> 01:29:29,123
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the chair.

1495
01:29:29,283 --> 01:29:30,965
[SPEAKER_09]: I have some information about Jahi.

1496
01:29:31,285 --> 01:29:31,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Yesterday,

1497
01:29:34,163 --> 01:29:34,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, yeah.

1498
01:29:36,285 --> 01:29:37,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob remembers this.

1499
01:29:37,687 --> 01:29:41,891
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw Jahi and his skivvies, but we're not supposed to talk about that.

1500
01:29:43,312 --> 01:29:45,414
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't want to spread too many rumors here.

1501
01:29:45,895 --> 01:29:46,575
[SPEAKER_09]: What's it say?

1502
01:29:46,776 --> 01:29:47,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't say who, don't say who.

1503
01:29:47,857 --> 01:29:48,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Woo!

1504
01:29:48,537 --> 01:29:50,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody wants to take the cock.

1505
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,261
[SPEAKER_09]: They will remain nameless.

1506
01:29:54,103 --> 01:29:54,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up!

1507
01:29:55,324 --> 01:29:57,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I don't do underage.

1508
01:29:59,028 --> 01:29:59,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't say it.

1509
01:29:59,809 --> 01:30:01,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, Rob, that was rude.

1510
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:03,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Good thing we didn't get that on the mic.

1511
01:30:03,314 --> 01:30:05,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, you should go find some boobs.

1512
01:30:05,617 --> 01:30:06,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Rob needs some boobs.

1513
01:30:07,239 --> 01:30:08,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob's got boobs.

1514
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:10,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, Brad, your shadow is fucking awesome.

1515
01:30:11,124 --> 01:30:11,925
[SPEAKER_09]: I look like Chrono.

1516
01:30:11,945 --> 01:30:13,187
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

1517
01:30:15,419 --> 01:30:15,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Touch your boobs.

1518
01:30:16,959 --> 01:30:17,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't touch them.

1519
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:19,620
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to quit.

1520
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, no nipple touching.

1521
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:23,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob doesn't have the microphone.

1522
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:24,601
[SPEAKER_05]: We took it away from him.

1523
01:30:25,101 --> 01:30:26,081
[SPEAKER_09]: He's over here molesting girls.

1524
01:30:26,101 --> 01:30:26,901
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't puke on it.

1525
01:30:27,741 --> 01:30:28,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob likes boobs.

1526
01:30:28,981 --> 01:30:31,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1527
01:30:31,922 --> 01:30:35,262
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the show of all shows.

1528
01:30:36,003 --> 01:30:40,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Be... I have two microphones.

1529
01:30:40,823 --> 01:30:42,224
[SPEAKER_02]: This is cool.

1530
01:30:43,044 --> 01:30:43,684
[SPEAKER_02]: It's new.

1531
01:30:44,508 --> 01:30:47,531
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to talk about Xtreme.

1532
01:30:47,811 --> 01:30:48,912
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR Xtreme.

1533
01:30:49,072 --> 01:30:51,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I played a non-stop today and I ranked.

1534
01:30:51,354 --> 01:30:52,975
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

1535
01:30:52,995 --> 01:31:06,467
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought I was old and broken down and smelly and I wasn't ever going to rank on a non-stop ever again, but I ranked.

1536
01:31:06,787 --> 01:31:07,168
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?

1537
01:31:07,828 --> 01:31:08,429
[SPEAKER_03]: You are rank.

1538
01:31:09,169 --> 01:31:09,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up!

1539
01:31:18,297 --> 01:31:23,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't, if anybody's new, tuning in tonight that's never listened before, trust us, this isn't the way it usually is.

1540
01:31:23,041 --> 01:31:26,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes it is, what the fuck are you talking about?

1541
01:31:26,464 --> 01:31:26,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Woman!

1542
01:31:27,825 --> 01:31:27,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Woman!

1543
01:31:28,025 --> 01:31:29,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob is an angry drunk.

1544
01:31:29,907 --> 01:31:30,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Goddammit.

1545
01:31:30,968 --> 01:31:32,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob is an angry drunk.

1546
01:31:32,709 --> 01:31:34,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, where's the song?

1547
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:34,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the song?

1548
01:31:37,876 --> 01:31:44,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone's, oh yeah, by the way, our word of the night, everyone, our word of the night is porn.

1549
01:31:45,163 --> 01:31:46,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Porn!

1550
01:31:47,105 --> 01:31:48,427
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have it?

1551
01:31:49,107 --> 01:31:51,630
[SPEAKER_09]: You get porn when you say the word.

1552
01:31:53,552 --> 01:31:55,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I get a shot of something if I say the word?

1553
01:31:56,377 --> 01:31:56,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't!

1554
01:31:57,197 --> 01:31:58,798
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to get to our porny music.

[SPEAKER_17]: Porn, porn, porn, porn.

01:32:03,239 --> 01:32:04,759
[SPEAKER_17]: Porn, porn, porn, porn.

1558
01:32:04,779 --> 01:32:05,939
[SPEAKER_17]: P-p-p-p-porn.

01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:09,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me pick something, goddammit.

01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:12,301
[SPEAKER_14]: I have something that we... How'd that work?

1565
01:32:19,383 --> 01:32:21,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob, I thought you said you got gayer when you got drunk.

1566
01:32:24,864 --> 01:32:27,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Tina a long time, and she'll let me touch her boobs whenever I want.

1567
01:32:27,846 --> 01:32:29,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know he doesn't get off, and so it's all fine.

1568
01:32:29,867 --> 01:32:30,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob has a past issue with the boobs.

1569
01:32:31,068 --> 01:32:31,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1570
01:32:31,568 --> 01:32:32,249
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all for Brocky.

1571
01:32:32,309 --> 01:32:33,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, he's trying to touch my leg.

1572
01:32:34,110 --> 01:32:34,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Like your buddy?

1573
01:32:34,771 --> 01:32:35,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

1576
01:32:59,166 --> 01:33:01,926
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that thing.

1577
01:33:02,346 --> 01:33:04,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that thing.

1578
01:33:04,547 --> 01:33:07,807
[SPEAKER_25]: You bet the Gold Club, too?

1579
01:33:08,167 --> 01:33:10,468
[SPEAKER_05]: The Gold Club isn't that bad.

1580
01:33:11,828 --> 01:33:14,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Best show ever.

1581
01:33:15,128 --> 01:33:15,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Haha!

1582
01:33:15,969 --> 01:33:17,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Best clip, Rob.

1583
01:33:18,109 --> 01:33:20,409
[SPEAKER_05]: 23Mega says, Rob is so drunk he's straight.

1584
01:33:22,590 --> 01:33:23,130
[SPEAKER_05]: If only.

1585
01:33:31,636 --> 01:33:31,856
[SPEAKER_15]: Awww!

[SPEAKER_15]: Do it with me!

1587
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:37,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1588
01:33:39,361 --> 01:33:44,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the person says he's not nameless, Twin who is not nameless will take the cock.

1589
01:33:46,286 --> 01:33:46,887
[SPEAKER_08]: And he wants porn.

1590
01:33:46,927 --> 01:33:47,707
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanna play something!

01:33:47,927 --> 01:33:48,608

01:33:49,901 --> 01:33:50,541
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll play my song.

1594
01:33:50,581 --> 01:33:51,582
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll play his song.

1595
01:33:51,622 --> 01:33:54,742
[SPEAKER_05]: We are now passing the control of Winamp.

1596
01:33:54,782 --> 01:33:55,423
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I play a song?

1597
01:33:55,683 --> 01:33:56,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to add.

1598
01:33:57,563 --> 01:33:57,723

[SPEAKER_08]: I can do this.

1604
01:34:04,805 --> 01:34:07,006
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you click the button.

1605
01:34:07,186 --> 01:34:08,026
[SPEAKER_05]: The one on the left.

1606
01:34:09,161 --> 01:34:11,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you playing shit on this show?

1607
01:34:12,664 --> 01:34:15,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Because no one ever votes for my Cage Max song!

1608
01:34:15,486 --> 01:34:16,346
[SPEAKER_08]: This is your punishment!

1609
01:34:16,366 --> 01:34:17,847
[SPEAKER_08]: This is now our bad music section.

1610
01:34:17,867 --> 01:34:18,768

1614
01:36:11,787 --> 01:36:15,328
[SPEAKER_00]: In the evening, floating in the soup.

1615
01:36:16,334 --> 01:36:25,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Fish heads, fish heads, roly-poly fish heads, fish heads, fish heads, eat them up young.

1616
01:36:26,057 --> 01:36:34,040
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask a fish head anything you want to, they won't answer, they can't talk.

1617
01:36:45,648 --> 01:36:49,350
[SPEAKER_15]: That's enough for the fish heads, I'm sorry.

1618
01:36:49,931 --> 01:36:52,052
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Dr. Demento, but I can't stand any more fish heads.

1619
01:36:52,312 --> 01:36:54,574
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a 1 minute and 40 second break.

1644
01:38:45,699 --> 01:38:47,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Streisand wanted me to moan.

1645
01:38:48,181 --> 01:38:48,521

1663
01:39:19,967 --> 01:39:23,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there's somebody who's going to kick your ass if you do, and you know who that is.

01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:27,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan would so, like, kick your ass.

[SPEAKER_09]: Dan likes you.

1674
01:39:43,523 --> 01:39:45,564
[SPEAKER_09]: With a nice Chianti and some fava beans.

1675
01:39:46,584 --> 01:39:47,225
[SPEAKER_05]: And some gum.

1676
01:39:47,605 --> 01:39:47,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Gum.

1677
01:39:48,465 --> 01:39:49,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, that was Zorak.

1678
01:39:53,048 --> 01:39:57,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Even the people in town that don't like me I think are starting to be okay with me, so that's cool.

1679
01:39:57,531 --> 01:39:59,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody just wants your ass.

1680
01:39:59,192 --> 01:40:00,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Eventually they realize they can't beat you.

1681
01:40:01,073 --> 01:40:01,553
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1682
01:40:02,609 --> 01:40:04,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody loves me.

1683
01:40:04,490 --> 01:40:05,811
[SPEAKER_07]: You love me.

1684
01:40:05,931 --> 01:40:06,792
[SPEAKER_07]: They come around.

1685
01:40:08,072 --> 01:40:08,533
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1686
01:40:08,693 --> 01:40:09,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to.

1687
01:40:10,394 --> 01:40:10,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait.

1688
01:40:11,875 --> 01:40:13,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they do Shooting Star?

1689
01:40:13,336 --> 01:40:15,137
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give you a cage match.

1690
01:40:15,157 --> 01:40:16,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's your cage match.

1691
01:40:16,658 --> 01:40:19,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cage match time.

1692
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:19,640
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1693
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:20,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you can do it.

1694
01:40:21,021 --> 01:40:24,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Rob seems to be somewhat sober enough that he can take the chair again.

1695
01:40:25,609 --> 01:40:27,933
[SPEAKER_05]: So Rob, I give you back your job.

1696
01:40:28,294 --> 01:40:31,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, dudes and dudesettes.

1697
01:40:33,603 --> 01:40:34,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up!

1698
01:40:34,885 --> 01:40:36,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Joe, I don't suck.

1699
01:40:36,427 --> 01:40:37,690
[SPEAKER_07]: You suck more.

1700
01:40:40,915 --> 01:40:42,155
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been drinking a little bit.

1701
01:40:42,496 --> 01:40:42,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

1702
01:40:43,356 --> 01:40:43,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, hold on.

1703
01:40:43,956 --> 01:40:45,757
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey everybody, they're gonna fight!

1704
01:40:45,838 --> 01:40:46,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's right.

1705
01:40:46,558 --> 01:40:48,699
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going into the cage match.

1706
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,441
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the drunken cage match.

1707
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:53,682
[SPEAKER_07]: I still haven't even picked my song for this week.

1708
01:40:54,203 --> 01:40:59,546
[SPEAKER_07]: However, last week in the big, fat, bloated cage match...

1709
01:41:01,385 --> 01:41:05,586
[SPEAKER_07]: We had, the winner was Aphex Twin doing a song called Eat Em Up.

1710
01:41:05,907 --> 01:41:08,067
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not called Eat Em Up, it's called Power Pill.

1711
01:41:09,028 --> 01:41:09,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha!

1712
01:41:09,668 --> 01:41:12,729
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, just like Tina's pussy, eat it up.

1713
01:41:12,749 --> 01:41:15,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to get beat up for that.

1714
01:41:15,670 --> 01:41:15,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Yum.

1715
01:41:17,110 --> 01:41:21,551
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, here's a clip of that song in case you forgot what it sounds like.

1716
01:41:23,092 --> 01:41:26,393
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to close all these excess windows first off.

1717
01:41:26,833 --> 01:41:28,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Twins, stop messaging me.

1718
01:41:29,634 --> 01:41:30,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, whatever.

1719
01:41:31,594 --> 01:41:35,075
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to close all these extra windows before we start the cage match so I can do quotes.

1720
01:41:39,196 --> 01:41:40,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here we go.

1721
01:41:40,476 --> 01:41:43,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week's winner, Apex Twin with Power Pill.

1722
01:41:43,677 --> 01:41:44,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is.

1723
01:42:26,499 --> 01:42:27,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lodge Cage Match!

1724
01:42:58,142 --> 01:43:00,983
[SPEAKER_15]: If you look around, everyone is in a hurry.

1725
01:43:01,283 --> 01:43:03,664
[SPEAKER_15]: Somewhere, it's too far away.

1726
01:43:03,784 --> 01:43:07,265
[SPEAKER_15]: If you notice this year, it will come to an end so soon.

1727
01:43:54,004 --> 01:43:54,634
Thank you.

1728
01:44:10,703 --> 01:44:11,363
Thank you for watching!

1729
01:45:06,834 --> 01:45:07,376
DarkSakura

1730
01:46:33,210 --> 01:46:33,851
Thanks for watching!

1731
01:47:13,226 --> 01:47:14,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1732
01:47:14,627 --> 01:47:17,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm starting to get a little bit of my coherency back after drinking so much this show.

1733
01:47:18,010 --> 01:47:18,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Should I make a new shot?

1734
01:47:18,731 --> 01:47:20,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think I need another new shot.

1735
01:47:20,493 --> 01:47:20,813
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1736
01:47:21,393 --> 01:47:26,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that was Yumi Hamasaki with M, the Above and Beyond mix.

1737
01:47:26,218 --> 01:47:27,178
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you think of that, Jamie?

1738
01:47:27,559 --> 01:47:28,239
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty cool.

1739
01:47:28,259 --> 01:47:28,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I give it an 8.

1740
01:47:29,260 --> 01:47:28,980
8.

1741
01:47:29,601 --> 01:47:31,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad, what did you think of Yumi Hamasaki with M?

1742
01:47:32,703 --> 01:47:33,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Out of a scale of 10?

1743
01:47:34,225 --> 01:47:34,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1744
01:47:34,965 --> 01:47:35,846
[SPEAKER_09]: I give it an 8.

1745
01:47:36,266 --> 01:47:37,047
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Connected is better.

1746
01:47:37,467 --> 01:47:37,808
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1747
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:38,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1748
01:47:39,898 --> 01:47:44,660
[SPEAKER_08]: I give it a 9 because I like all of her stuff and I can't judge you on which is the best.

1749
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:46,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, explicit.

1750
01:47:46,061 --> 01:47:47,161
[SPEAKER_07]: 8.5 Any reason?

1751
01:47:51,784 --> 01:47:54,006
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, I like Connected better, but this one's pretty good.

1752
01:47:54,046 --> 01:47:54,806
[SPEAKER_18]: I like this very well.

1753
01:48:17,643 --> 01:48:19,124
[SPEAKER_07]: and they were big a few years ago.

1754
01:48:19,224 --> 01:48:22,746
[SPEAKER_07]: This song is called You're Not Alone here on Orange Lounge Radio's Cage Match.

1755
01:48:38,594 --> 01:48:43,437
[SPEAKER_14]: In a way it's all a matter of time

1756
01:48:45,814 --> 01:49:12,937
[SPEAKER_14]: I will not worry for you You'll be just fine Take my thoughts with you And when you look behind You will surely see a face that you recognize You're not alone I'll wait till the end of time

1757
01:49:14,452 --> 01:49:34,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Open your mind Surely it's plain to see You're not alone I'll wait till the end of time for you Open your mind Surely the time to be with me

1758
01:49:46,261 --> 01:49:55,443
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a distance that makes life a little hard Two minds that once were close

1759
01:50:57,898 --> 01:50:58,760
Thank you for watching!

1760
01:52:42,859 --> 01:52:47,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, boys and girls, that was Olive with You Are Not Alone on the Orange Lounge Cage Match.

1761
01:52:47,201 --> 01:52:49,282
[SPEAKER_07]: A little slow for some of you, I think, I don't know.

1762
01:52:50,242 --> 01:52:52,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, what'd you guys think about?

1763
01:52:52,403 --> 01:52:53,624
[SPEAKER_12]: I give that a 9, I like it.

1764
01:52:53,644 --> 01:52:54,384
[SPEAKER_07]: You give that a 9?

1765
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:55,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Jamie.

1766
01:52:55,825 --> 01:52:56,945
[SPEAKER_07]: That's 10 all the way.

1767
01:52:57,185 --> 01:53:00,047
[SPEAKER_09]: That song has, oh man, long time favorites.

1768
01:53:00,327 --> 01:53:01,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, cool.

1769
01:53:01,667 --> 01:53:03,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Who else is back there?

1770
01:53:03,068 --> 01:53:03,548
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't see.

1771
01:53:03,888 --> 01:53:04,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas, what'd you think of that?

1772
01:53:05,489 --> 01:53:05,849
[SPEAKER_18]: I give it a 9.

1773
01:53:06,049 --> 01:53:06,729
[SPEAKER_18]: I like it.

1774
01:53:06,850 --> 01:53:07,490
[SPEAKER_18]: I like it very much.

1775
01:53:08,331 --> 01:53:09,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Our chat room doesn't seem to like it.

1776
01:53:09,791 --> 01:53:10,191
[SPEAKER_07]: It's weird.

1777
01:53:10,251 --> 01:53:11,772
[SPEAKER_07]: We all seem to like it, but the chat room doesn't.

1778
01:53:12,432 --> 01:53:13,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.

1779
01:53:13,132 --> 01:53:14,712
[SPEAKER_05]: I normally don't like things like that.

1780
01:53:15,812 --> 01:53:16,693
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked it, too.

1781
01:53:16,713 --> 01:53:18,533
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that one.

1782
01:53:19,033 --> 01:53:19,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1783
01:53:20,013 --> 01:53:20,433
[SPEAKER_07]: I give it a 10.

1784
01:53:20,913 --> 01:53:21,513
[SPEAKER_07]: It ruled.

1785
01:53:22,234 --> 01:53:24,174
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you don't like it, you can kiss my fat ass.

1786
01:53:24,654 --> 01:53:29,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, send your votes over a private message in the chat room.

1787
01:53:30,975 --> 01:53:35,016
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can vote for either the Power Pill song...

1788
01:53:40,548 --> 01:53:43,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you can vote for M, the Above and Beyond Mix.

1789
01:53:49,916 --> 01:53:52,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you can vote for Olive with You Are Not Alone.

1790
01:53:56,306 --> 01:54:01,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Send those votes over private message to me, Sky, in the chat room right now.

1791
01:54:01,092 --> 01:54:04,897
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll tally those up and read them for you towards the end of the show.

1792
01:54:05,277 --> 01:54:07,740
[SPEAKER_07]: In the meantime, we're preparing for a list list really fast.

1793
01:54:07,780 --> 01:54:10,924
[SPEAKER_07]: The topic tonight, Jamie, tell us about tonight's topic for list list.

1794
01:54:11,325 --> 01:54:13,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to name my car, and I don't know what to name it.

1795
01:54:15,027 --> 01:54:21,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the only thing I'm really going to do the outside of is put the little, you know, I, I right next to the DX on the back of my car so I can be 2DX.

1796
01:54:22,568 --> 01:54:30,670
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, so basically the way that you play this list is each of us lists our top three picks and everybody votes one off the island.

1797
01:54:32,790 --> 01:54:36,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1798
01:54:36,911 --> 01:54:39,051
[SPEAKER_07]: You can work with somebody else who isn't playing, Tina.

1799
01:54:39,111 --> 01:54:41,692
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're having a hard time, play with somebody else who isn't.

1800
01:54:44,309 --> 01:54:52,151
[SPEAKER_07]: And see, that's the good thing is that Tina and Jamie don't know each other that well, so... Shut up back there!

1801
01:54:52,251 --> 01:54:53,191
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm drunk, remember?

1802
01:54:53,671 --> 01:54:55,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been drinking that, by the way.

1803
01:54:55,511 --> 01:54:58,692
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're just tuning in, I have a three-day weekend, so I've been drinking a little bit.

1804
01:55:01,032 --> 01:55:01,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up!

1805
01:55:02,713 --> 01:55:07,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's touching me?

1806
01:55:07,414 --> 01:55:09,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't touch me, you're violating me.

1807
01:55:09,864 --> 01:55:11,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, my titty!

1808
01:55:11,506 --> 01:55:11,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1809
01:55:11,786 --> 01:55:12,988
[SPEAKER_02]: You do it to me, I give it back.

1810
01:55:13,008 --> 01:55:14,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we're going to take a really quick break.

1811
01:55:14,309 --> 01:55:16,812
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to take a two minute break with a song from 2DX8Style.

1812
01:55:17,232 --> 01:55:20,035
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll be right back with tonight's list list.

1813
01:55:20,095 --> 01:55:21,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Things we're going to name Jamie's car.

1814
01:55:22,117 --> 01:55:22,578
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back.

1815
01:57:21,673 --> 01:57:25,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it

1819
01:58:10,875 --> 01:58:12,316

1826
01:58:28,247 --> 01:58:29,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I'm not even done with my list yet.

1827
01:58:29,988 --> 01:58:31,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I was still trying to look up some names here.

1828
01:58:35,051 --> 01:58:35,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, okay.

1829
01:58:36,532 --> 01:58:37,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob's thinking.

01:58:37,553 --> 01:58:37,793
[SPEAKER_07]: I got it.

1831
01:58:37,813 --> 01:58:39,815
[SPEAKER_05]: It's taking him a while, you know.

1832
01:58:40,195 --> 01:58:41,196
[SPEAKER_07]: You're supposed to pick three.

1833
01:58:41,256 --> 01:58:41,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have three?

1834
01:58:41,917 --> 01:58:42,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Does everybody have three?

1835
01:58:42,837 --> 01:58:45,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the little gears in his brain... Jonas is still working then.

1836
01:58:45,559 --> 01:58:49,382
[SPEAKER_05]: The gears in his brain are well greased, but there's no electricity going to them.

1837
01:58:49,562 --> 01:58:50,003
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1838
01:58:50,263 --> 01:58:50,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep talking.

1839
01:58:50,783 --> 01:58:51,744
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to close some of these windows.

1840
01:58:52,405 --> 01:58:53,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Words.

1841
01:58:53,586 --> 01:58:54,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Talking.

1842
01:58:55,107 --> 01:58:56,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to talk.

1843
01:58:56,428 --> 01:58:57,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, what?

1844
01:58:57,689 --> 01:59:00,531
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1845
01:59:03,047 --> 01:59:04,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that why I'm smelling steam in the front room?

1846
01:59:04,748 --> 01:59:06,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Rob is stinking?

1847
01:59:06,930 --> 01:59:07,671
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly it.

1848
01:59:07,691 --> 01:59:10,213
[SPEAKER_05]: But I thought it said he smelled like he's stinking.

1849
01:59:10,333 --> 01:59:11,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Kiss my black ass.

1850
01:59:11,614 --> 01:59:13,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that too, but you know.

1851
01:59:13,795 --> 01:59:14,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, you stink.

1852
01:59:14,516 --> 01:59:16,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't stink!

1853
01:59:16,678 --> 01:59:18,819
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll have a black ass when I'm done kicking it.

1854
01:59:18,919 --> 01:59:20,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, you don't have a black ass.

1855
01:59:20,240 --> 01:59:21,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry to inform you of this.

1856
01:59:21,862 --> 01:59:23,283
[SPEAKER_07]: You smell like roses.

1857
01:59:23,383 --> 01:59:24,904
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no.

1858
01:59:24,964 --> 01:59:27,226

02:04:19,862 --> 02:04:19,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1981
02:04:21,519 --> 02:04:22,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob just said coming.

1982
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:26,581
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna have to say Nottingham's coming up.

1983
02:04:26,922 --> 02:04:28,242
[SPEAKER_09]: You cocksucker!

1984
02:04:28,602 --> 02:04:29,883
[SPEAKER_09]: That name sucks.

1985
02:04:30,223 --> 02:04:30,904
[SPEAKER_09]: You sucks.

1986
02:04:31,304 --> 02:04:32,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Almost as bad as KK Copmaster.

1987
02:04:35,386 --> 02:04:36,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no you didn't, bitch.

1988
02:04:36,786 --> 02:04:39,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Jonas, you gotta take one of these names off the list.

1989
02:04:39,988 --> 02:04:41,349
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a nice man, let me see.

1990
02:04:41,369 --> 02:04:47,592
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know what to take out, but... Oh, no!

1991
02:04:48,852 --> 02:04:50,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Jamie vetoed it.

1992
02:04:51,212 --> 02:04:52,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie vetoed it.

1993
02:04:52,955 --> 02:04:54,478
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to take something else off instead.

1994
02:04:56,341 --> 02:04:56,962
[SPEAKER_18]: Screw that.

1995
02:04:58,945 --> 02:05:01,009
[SPEAKER_18]: What's with move out of my way, bitch?

1996
02:05:01,029 --> 02:05:01,990
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a long ass name.

1997
02:05:02,050 --> 02:05:05,015
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you take a move out of my way, bitch, or I'll run your ass over.

1998
02:05:05,894 --> 02:05:06,154
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1999
02:05:06,174 --> 02:05:10,659
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to say, like, oh, here's my move out of my wish, bitch, I'm going to run away.

2000
02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:10,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2001
02:05:11,620 --> 02:05:14,683
[SPEAKER_07]: That's more of what Jamie's going to say when she's driving the car, not the name of the car.

2002
02:05:14,703 --> 02:05:16,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Precious, move out of my way, bitch, or I'll run your ass over.

2003
02:05:16,985 --> 02:05:20,048
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so move out of my way, bitch, or I'll run your ass over comes off the list.

2004
02:05:20,068 --> 02:05:20,349
[SPEAKER_15]: My precious.

2005
02:05:21,430 --> 02:05:22,111
[SPEAKER_15]: My precious.

2006
02:05:22,771 --> 02:05:25,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Loki, what's coming off the list?

2007
02:05:26,974 --> 02:05:27,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming.

2008
02:05:28,756 --> 02:05:28,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

2009
02:05:29,296 --> 02:05:30,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Max Cubed.

2010
02:05:30,697 --> 02:05:31,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Max Cubed.

2011
02:05:32,538 --> 02:05:33,419
[SPEAKER_07]: It's coming off the list.

2012
02:05:33,479 --> 02:05:34,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry to hear it.

2013
02:05:35,561 --> 02:05:45,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, my pick for coming off the list, I'm sorry to whack Jonas twice in a row, but Buzz isn't really something that I don't think Jamie would want to name her car, so I have to take Buzz off the list.

2014
02:05:46,110 --> 02:05:48,472
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we're left with a tiny little list here.

2015
02:05:48,912 --> 02:05:49,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what my pick is.

2016
02:05:50,033 --> 02:05:53,015
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are your choices, ladies and gentlemen.

2017
02:05:53,075 --> 02:05:58,658
[SPEAKER_07]: And just because Jamie doesn't have to go with what you guys say, but you can send me your votes.

2018
02:05:58,678 --> 02:06:00,059
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the unofficial secondary nickname.

2019
02:06:00,079 --> 02:06:01,681
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the unofficial secondary nickname.

2020
02:06:01,961 --> 02:06:03,502
[SPEAKER_07]: But these are the ones you can vote for.

2021
02:06:04,122 --> 02:06:14,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Outphase, My Baby Mama, Vic Viper, Green Blaze, Propel, Lord Rickman, The Alan Rickman Sex Machine, or K.K.

2022
02:06:14,529 --> 02:06:15,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Cockmaster.

2023
02:06:17,351 --> 02:06:18,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are your choices.

2024
02:06:18,732 --> 02:06:21,955
[SPEAKER_07]: You can send me your votes live right now in the chat room.

2025
02:06:23,576 --> 02:06:27,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Just so the Asian Harry Potter knows, Buzz was taken off the list by me.

2026
02:06:28,220 --> 02:06:28,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

2027
02:06:30,802 --> 02:06:34,064
[SPEAKER_07]: He voted for Buzz, but he can't vote for Buzz because I took Buzz off the list.

2028
02:06:34,124 --> 02:06:35,125
[SPEAKER_07]: So, ha.

2029
02:06:37,827 --> 02:06:38,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Suck me.

2030
02:06:38,988 --> 02:06:39,328
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2031
02:06:39,509 --> 02:06:40,930
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not naming my car Suck Me.

2032
02:06:41,030 --> 02:06:42,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Be beautiful.

2033
02:06:42,961 --> 02:06:45,503
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you can't, Stressa, you can vote for Propel.

2034
02:06:45,864 --> 02:06:49,547
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, it was, it was vetoed to take off the list.

2035
02:06:50,028 --> 02:06:51,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you shooting things at my crotch over there?

2036
02:06:53,731 --> 02:06:53,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2037
02:06:56,353 --> 02:07:00,077
[SPEAKER_07]: So, do we want to take a quick musical break while they vote, or do we want to just talk about something else?

2038
02:07:00,197 --> 02:07:01,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, quick musical break.

2039
02:07:01,959 --> 02:07:02,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Any requests?

2040
02:07:03,180 --> 02:07:04,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.

2041
02:07:05,182 --> 02:07:08,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, play, um, actually, I'm,

2042
02:07:09,804 --> 02:07:12,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to hear, Rob, Happy Hopper.

2043
02:07:12,307 --> 02:07:13,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to hear Happy Hopper?

2044
02:07:13,429 --> 02:07:14,590
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't heard Happy Hopper in forever.

2045
02:07:14,630 --> 02:07:16,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's the theme to the show now, remember?

2046
02:07:17,033 --> 02:07:19,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I want to hear Happy Hopper without the theme to the show.

2047
02:07:19,336 --> 02:07:20,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we're going to do Happy Hopper.

2048
02:07:20,919 --> 02:07:23,682
[SPEAKER_07]: That means you have a minute to send me your votes.

2049
02:07:23,902 --> 02:07:24,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, play that too.

2050
02:07:25,605 --> 02:07:26,446
[SPEAKER_07]: What else do you want to hear?

2051
02:07:26,606 --> 02:07:26,966
[SPEAKER_05]: A minute.

2052
02:07:27,387 --> 02:07:28,108
[SPEAKER_07]: A minute, okay.

2053
02:07:30,811 --> 02:07:37,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we'll be doing those and we'll be right back here on Orange Lounge Radio where I'm a little bit tipsy tonight, boys and girls.

2054
02:07:38,378 --> 02:07:38,979
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit tipsy.

2055
02:07:39,019 --> 02:07:39,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been drinking.

2056
02:09:23,426 --> 02:09:24,195
Thanks for watching!

2057
02:10:38,035 --> 02:10:42,817
[SPEAKER_15]: From StepSquad to OrangeLabs, this PDR sucks!

2058
02:10:43,177 --> 02:10:44,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Holla, all of you!

2059
02:10:44,277 --> 02:10:45,258
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to win!

2060
02:10:45,278 --> 02:10:45,418
[SPEAKER_15]: PS!

2061
02:10:45,438 --> 02:10:46,078
[SPEAKER_15]: TTPO!

2062
02:10:54,281 --> 02:10:55,202
[SPEAKER_07]: I need another drink.

2063
02:10:55,682 --> 02:10:55,902
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2064
02:10:56,082 --> 02:10:57,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, one more drink.

2065
02:10:57,203 --> 02:10:58,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, but let me mix you one.

2066
02:10:58,624 --> 02:10:59,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, mix me one.

2067
02:10:59,764 --> 02:11:00,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any vanilla coke?

2068
02:11:01,345 --> 02:11:02,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Vanilla coke with a vanilla vodka.

2069
02:11:03,066 --> 02:11:03,927
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're out.

2070
02:11:04,087 --> 02:11:07,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there's some still left in this can, but you need to, like, carbonate.

2071
02:11:07,669 --> 02:11:08,850
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably a couple days old.

2072
02:11:09,070 --> 02:11:09,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no.

2073
02:11:09,651 --> 02:11:10,371
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gonna be gross.

2074
02:11:10,411 --> 02:11:12,272
[SPEAKER_09]: If you take a look in here, there's something in here.

2075
02:11:12,292 --> 02:11:12,853
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks bad.

2076
02:11:13,033 --> 02:11:13,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Ew.

2077
02:11:13,433 --> 02:11:14,073
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like mold.

2078
02:11:14,393 --> 02:11:14,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Ew.

2079
02:11:14,474 --> 02:11:16,515
[SPEAKER_09]: There's mold on the inside of the coke can.

2080
02:11:16,555 --> 02:11:17,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Dump that shit out.

2081
02:11:17,395 --> 02:11:17,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I will.

2082
02:11:19,016 --> 02:11:19,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, whoa.

2083
02:11:19,897 --> 02:11:20,817
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not expensive.

2084
02:11:20,918 --> 02:11:21,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

2085
02:11:22,532 --> 02:11:25,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, um, the winner!

2086
02:11:32,339 --> 02:11:33,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess, yeah.

2087
02:11:34,380 --> 02:11:35,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, yeah, you can't.

2088
02:11:39,044 --> 02:11:40,205
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gonna take a while though.

2089
02:11:41,706 --> 02:11:43,747
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gonna take like an hour to wash, an hour to dry.

2090
02:11:44,347 --> 02:11:44,908
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you wanna do?

2091
02:11:44,928 --> 02:11:45,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2092
02:11:46,269 --> 02:11:46,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

2093
02:11:47,109 --> 02:11:47,630
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

2094
02:11:49,355 --> 02:11:50,436
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we'll figure something out.

2095
02:11:50,997 --> 02:11:51,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2096
02:11:52,898 --> 02:11:57,642
[SPEAKER_07]: The number three pick for something Jamie should name her car.

2097
02:11:58,623 --> 02:11:59,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Outphase.

2098
02:12:02,567 --> 02:12:02,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.

2099
02:12:03,648 --> 02:12:09,553
[SPEAKER_07]: The number two pick, and I'm quite disappointed this only ended up in number two, but it was a good showing anyway.

2100
02:12:09,993 --> 02:12:12,696
[SPEAKER_07]: The number two pick for something Jamie should name her car.

2101
02:12:13,176 --> 02:12:14,858
[SPEAKER_07]: KK Cockmaster.

2102
02:12:17,981 --> 02:12:24,628
[SPEAKER_07]: The number one choice for something Jamie should name her car, the winner, Vic Viper.

2103
02:12:27,812 --> 02:12:30,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, are you going to name the car Vic Viper?

2104
02:12:31,896 --> 02:12:33,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I will name it something based off of Vic Viper.

2105
02:12:33,778 --> 02:12:36,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I will name it Pentoro.

2106
02:12:36,661 --> 02:12:37,462
[SPEAKER_07]: What exactly is Pentoro?

2107
02:12:37,502 --> 02:12:39,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the Parodius version?

2108
02:12:39,744 --> 02:12:41,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, from Parodius.

2109
02:12:42,045 --> 02:12:50,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because the only other one would be, the only other character that I use in Parodius is Tadosuke, so I'll use Pintaro.

2110
02:12:51,166 --> 02:12:53,407
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some good last minute suggestions come in.

2111
02:12:53,427 --> 02:12:57,848
[SPEAKER_07]: The Nocturnal Penile Turcescence Max, what do you think of it?

2112
02:12:57,908 --> 02:12:59,208
[SPEAKER_07]: The Asian Blazer.

2113
02:13:02,669 --> 02:13:03,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Does she have a mic?

2114
02:13:03,469 --> 02:13:05,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a mic?

2115
02:13:05,329 --> 02:13:07,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't name it that because my card doesn't have a spoiler.

2116
02:13:09,213 --> 02:13:10,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, just Dick?

2117
02:13:10,855 --> 02:13:11,035
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2118
02:13:11,375 --> 02:13:14,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Or best of both worlds, the Vic Vipers, Nocturnal Penile Intercessions.

2119
02:13:15,019 --> 02:13:18,022
[SPEAKER_05]: You can call it the Dick Di... The Dick Diaper?

2120
02:13:21,354 --> 02:13:23,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we got some time to kill here on the show.

2121
02:13:23,936 --> 02:13:25,757
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to do the other thingy.

2122
02:13:26,457 --> 02:13:27,398
[SPEAKER_07]: What, we want to do a match game?

2123
02:13:27,698 --> 02:13:31,221
[SPEAKER_04]: No, our, um, our... Oh, we already did that.

2124
02:13:31,301 --> 02:13:32,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we did the cage match.

2125
02:13:32,722 --> 02:13:35,163
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to talk about some, uh, Bomani-related things.

2126
02:13:37,265 --> 02:13:39,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, we really do have lots of time to kill.

2127
02:13:40,043 --> 02:13:42,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas, you're our guest tonight.

2128
02:13:43,145 --> 02:13:45,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Any freestyles that we should be looking forward to?

2129
02:13:45,647 --> 02:13:46,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Some freestyle routines?

2130
02:13:46,527 --> 02:13:47,208
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you going to do?

2131
02:13:47,228 --> 02:13:48,148
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you going to bust out?

2132
02:13:48,569 --> 02:13:50,030
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your next freestyle that you're going to bust out?

2133
02:13:50,050 --> 02:13:51,651
[SPEAKER_18]: That will be... Big Black Clock.

2134
02:13:52,091 --> 02:13:53,412
[SPEAKER_18]: That will be classified information.

2135
02:13:53,432 --> 02:13:54,292
[SPEAKER_18]: Big Black Clock.

2136
02:13:54,352 --> 02:13:58,255
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll have to wait until another Sacramento tournament comes out to see another routine from me.

2137
02:13:58,475 --> 02:13:59,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Big Jim Slade.

2138
02:14:00,677 --> 02:14:01,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Down it, down it, Rob.

2139
02:14:02,138 --> 02:14:03,839
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell?

2140
02:14:04,519 --> 02:14:04,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob?

2141
02:14:05,780 --> 02:14:06,921
[SPEAKER_09]: That's more Midori.

2142
02:14:06,961 --> 02:14:08,181
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how expensive that Midori is?

2143
02:14:08,201 --> 02:14:08,822
[SPEAKER_09]: That's good.

2144
02:14:11,105 --> 02:14:13,766
[SPEAKER_18]: Tell me that people are not going to freestyle drunk?

2145
02:14:14,926 --> 02:14:16,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, dude, Drunk Drunk Revolution, good stuff.

2146
02:14:17,487 --> 02:14:18,868
[SPEAKER_18]: Drunk Drunk Revolution?

2147
02:14:18,888 --> 02:14:20,388
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, that's a new topic to talk about.

2148
02:14:20,688 --> 02:14:21,789
[SPEAKER_18]: Drunk Drunk Revolution.

2149
02:14:21,809 --> 02:14:24,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this man is an expert at Drunk Drunk Revolution.

2150
02:14:24,870 --> 02:14:32,432
[SPEAKER_09]: When they went to Vegas, what was it, the Star Trek experience, the Warp Core Breach, the, like, seven types of Bacardi?

2151
02:14:34,152 --> 02:14:35,553
[SPEAKER_09]: It runs down the side of the thing.

2152
02:14:36,133 --> 02:14:39,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Jimmy was saying the Midori was leaking, and, yeah.

2153
02:14:41,556 --> 02:14:42,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Drink it.

2154
02:14:42,396 --> 02:14:43,496
[SPEAKER_18]: Drunk Drunk Revolution.

2155
02:14:43,636 --> 02:14:46,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, just don't vomit on the pad, that's all I ask.

2156
02:14:46,677 --> 02:14:47,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Please.

2157
02:14:48,137 --> 02:14:48,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2158
02:14:48,737 --> 02:14:50,778
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, don't vomit on the memory card slots.

2159
02:14:50,838 --> 02:14:52,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't vomit on the memory card slots.

2160
02:14:52,838 --> 02:14:54,858
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll get some pukey edits.

2161
02:14:56,099 --> 02:14:56,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Pukey edits.

2162
02:14:59,799 --> 02:15:00,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

2163
02:15:01,019 --> 02:15:05,080
[SPEAKER_05]: That last shot that I made for Rob was Malibu and Midori.

2164
02:15:05,160 --> 02:15:05,680
[SPEAKER_09]: And Midori.

2165
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:08,841
[SPEAKER_09]: You are going to have a serious hangover, my friend.

2166
02:15:09,341 --> 02:15:10,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Too much liquor.

2167
02:15:12,105 --> 02:15:12,865
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think about that?

2168
02:15:13,166 --> 02:15:14,286
[SPEAKER_18]: Be money related.

2169
02:15:14,306 --> 02:15:15,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, I'm killing something up here.

2170
02:15:16,267 --> 02:15:17,388
[SPEAKER_09]: That wasn't what I asked you.

2171
02:15:19,049 --> 02:15:20,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut the fuck up, bitch.

2172
02:15:21,050 --> 02:15:21,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you dickhead.

2173
02:15:22,691 --> 02:15:23,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no.

2174
02:15:23,892 --> 02:15:24,392
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, no.

2175
02:15:25,092 --> 02:15:28,074
[SPEAKER_18]: Think about Drunk Drift Revolution, Drunk Mania, Drunk Drunk.

2176
02:15:28,723 --> 02:15:53,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Paradise, Drunk Drunk, oh my god, Key Drunk Mania or whatever, Key Drunk Mania, look at the possibility that Rob would do, Drunk Drunk Reggae, is that what we said Matt, Drunk Drunk Reggae from Jamaica, Max Drunk, actually that's more like, probably high, smoking all that reefer, right now you guys, I totally feel like I'm at a rave,

2177
02:15:57,720 --> 02:15:59,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, I'm so fucked up right now.

2178
02:16:01,362 --> 02:16:03,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God, give me a hug, crack.

2179
02:16:03,083 --> 02:16:03,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me a hug.

2180
02:16:05,085 --> 02:16:05,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you my bro.

2181
02:16:07,206 --> 02:16:10,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, yeah, I need a hug.

2182
02:16:10,828 --> 02:16:12,029
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, DJ?

2183
02:16:12,109 --> 02:16:14,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me, but I thought the word of the night was porn.

2184
02:16:15,031 --> 02:16:16,572
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to rave, baby.

2185
02:16:17,372 --> 02:16:18,393
[SPEAKER_05]: You're already raving.

2186
02:16:23,253 --> 02:16:24,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, pornography.

2187
02:16:24,814 --> 02:16:27,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Something I will not be experiencing for a long time.

2188
02:16:27,856 --> 02:16:28,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Wah, I cry.

2189
02:16:29,097 --> 02:16:33,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you were supposed to let me know where I can get my man porn from.

2190
02:16:37,782 --> 02:16:43,085
[SPEAKER_18]: Speaking of porn, when I went to church earlier today, the priest was all talking about porn.

2191
02:16:44,586 --> 02:16:46,447
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the priest saying about porn?

2192
02:16:48,294 --> 02:16:53,677
[SPEAKER_18]: How some of us were staring at the internet, looking at porn.

2193
02:16:53,997 --> 02:16:59,819
[SPEAKER_18]: How some of us were looking at sexual desires of people in raves, parties, etc, etc, etc.

2194
02:16:59,839 --> 02:17:02,461
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, he's all talking about porn in front of the little kids.

2195
02:17:02,481 --> 02:17:03,301
[SPEAKER_09]: And how he likes it.

2196
02:17:03,321 --> 02:17:11,365
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if priests actually do porn, but... It's getting hot in here, so take off all your clothes.

2197
02:17:13,468 --> 02:17:15,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, those pastors, those preachers, man.

2198
02:17:15,628 --> 02:17:15,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2199
02:17:16,008 --> 02:17:17,329
[SPEAKER_09]: They're sick motherfuckers.

2200
02:17:17,349 --> 02:17:18,709
[SPEAKER_18]: Masturbation on the Holy Cross?

2201
02:17:18,729 --> 02:17:19,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God.

2202
02:17:19,429 --> 02:17:19,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2203
02:17:19,909 --> 02:17:20,209
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

2204
02:17:20,549 --> 02:17:20,889
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

2205
02:17:22,310 --> 02:17:23,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Or the wish cup.

2206
02:17:23,810 --> 02:17:24,470
[SPEAKER_09]: That's blasphemy.

2207
02:17:24,530 --> 02:17:26,790
[SPEAKER_05]: No, go to that site with the cross-shaped vibrator.

2208
02:17:27,511 --> 02:17:27,791
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

2209
02:17:28,551 --> 02:17:29,811
[SPEAKER_09]: The Jesus suppository?

2210
02:17:29,991 --> 02:17:37,732
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they have vibrators, dildos, and one of them is the shape of the cross, and the other one is Jesus, and the other one's Mary.

2211
02:17:37,752 --> 02:17:40,713
[SPEAKER_15]: God, I love you.

2212
02:17:42,932 --> 02:17:44,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we talk about Mormonism with Brad?

2213
02:17:46,093 --> 02:17:47,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you all you need to know.

2214
02:17:52,775 --> 02:17:56,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Matt is worried about hearing the words, Sky and Loki in the same.

2215
02:17:56,556 --> 02:17:58,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Brad, what do Mormons think of gays?

2216
02:17:59,697 --> 02:18:00,678
[SPEAKER_09]: We think you're great.

2217
02:18:01,638 --> 02:18:06,419
[SPEAKER_09]: And the reason why is because it leaves more women to have wives with.

2218
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:08,000
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can have multiple wives.

2219
02:18:08,020 --> 02:18:11,321
[SPEAKER_09]: There's more free women because of all you fags.

2220
02:18:14,019 --> 02:18:14,979
[SPEAKER_09]: What about lesbians?

2221
02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:16,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Lesbians?

2222
02:18:16,340 --> 02:18:20,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's not so good, because then there's less women to have the multiple wives with.

2223
02:18:21,322 --> 02:18:22,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2224
02:18:22,462 --> 02:18:24,002
[SPEAKER_07]: What do Mormons think of DDR?

2225
02:18:25,703 --> 02:18:27,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Mormons created DDR.

2226
02:18:27,424 --> 02:18:28,724
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what you don't understand.

2227
02:18:29,164 --> 02:18:32,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you heard of the Illuminati?

2228
02:18:32,946 --> 02:18:42,069
[SPEAKER_07]: When I die and have my... Wait, Brad, when I die and have my own planet, will I have DDR all over my planet if I'm a Mormon?

2229
02:18:42,089 --> 02:18:42,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

2230
02:18:44,671 --> 02:18:49,135
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when I die, I always wanted to leave elaborate instructions of what to do with my body.

2231
02:18:49,335 --> 02:18:51,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, so elaborate that they wouldn't be able to be done.

2232
02:18:53,218 --> 02:18:58,703
[SPEAKER_08]: I want my ashes spread throughout the ventilation system of a major high-rise building.

2233
02:19:02,707 --> 02:19:05,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me tell you something about Mormonism.

2234
02:19:05,749 --> 02:19:07,191
[SPEAKER_15]: Here I go.

2235
02:19:08,542 --> 02:19:09,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, Brad.

2236
02:19:09,862 --> 02:19:12,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad, this is what I want to know about when it comes to Mormons.

2237
02:19:13,403 --> 02:19:15,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us about the magical underwear.

2238
02:19:16,664 --> 02:19:18,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the magical drawers?

2239
02:19:18,304 --> 02:19:18,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-huh.

2240
02:19:19,505 --> 02:19:19,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

2241
02:19:20,925 --> 02:19:21,625
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know anything about them.

2242
02:19:22,445 --> 02:19:24,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, tell us about the magical underwear.

2243
02:19:24,166 --> 02:19:25,526
[SPEAKER_09]: That's classified information.

2244
02:19:25,586 --> 02:19:26,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.

2245
02:19:27,047 --> 02:19:28,567
[SPEAKER_09]: If you were to see me...

2246
02:19:29,467 --> 02:19:34,913
[SPEAKER_09]: If you were to see me in my magical underwear, you would probably, like, you'd burn.

2247
02:19:35,033 --> 02:19:35,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Your eyes would burn.

2248
02:19:35,894 --> 02:19:39,157
[SPEAKER_07]: If you get skip marks in your magical underwear, do you go to hell?

2249
02:19:40,918 --> 02:19:47,225
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you have to take them to the Christian dry cleaning center or whatever, and they take care of that action.

2250
02:19:48,426 --> 02:19:54,273
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I know this is going to be so freaking dorky, but the movie Chicago, pretty good movie.

2251
02:19:54,713 --> 02:19:57,617
[SPEAKER_09]: They had a reference to Mormonism in there that was pretty damn funny.

2252
02:19:58,578 --> 02:19:59,539
[SPEAKER_09]: So everybody should go see that movie.

2253
02:20:01,441 --> 02:20:04,184
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys should just go see that movie because it really kicks ass.

2254
02:20:04,224 --> 02:20:06,026
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's this scene, like...

2255
02:20:06,989 --> 02:20:12,032
[SPEAKER_03]: When they're doing a press conference, and then they cut to the scene, and it's just really awesome.

2256
02:20:12,352 --> 02:20:18,817
[SPEAKER_05]: The choreograph, the makeup, everything about it is just... I still think that Dan has the best Mormon joke ever.

2257
02:20:19,317 --> 02:20:20,678
[SPEAKER_05]: The Mighty Mormon Power Rangers.

2258
02:20:21,278 --> 02:20:25,181
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I hate the film industry and their horrible attempts at sequels.

2259
02:20:25,581 --> 02:20:35,027
[SPEAKER_08]: For instance, they're making a sequel to Beetlejuice that's going to be Beetlejuice trapped in some sort of, like, netherworld place, and he meets up with the urban version of himself,

2260
02:20:35,587 --> 02:20:40,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Possibly played by John Leguizamo or Chris Rock.

2261
02:20:40,770 --> 02:20:42,351
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean like the Black Beetlejuice?

2262
02:20:43,312 --> 02:20:44,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, exactly.

2263
02:20:45,713 --> 02:20:46,254
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

2264
02:20:46,554 --> 02:20:48,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Chicago isn't a sequel to anything.

2265
02:20:48,335 --> 02:20:50,697
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a remake of a Broadway musical.

2266
02:20:51,297 --> 02:20:52,678
[SPEAKER_05]: So, on you.

2267
02:20:59,048 --> 02:21:06,932
[SPEAKER_05]: and all the main actors, Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger all do their own singing and dancing, which makes it just even more badass.

2268
02:21:07,032 --> 02:21:08,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hey, that reminds me.

2269
02:21:09,333 --> 02:21:21,399
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually found, because we get brochures from these really small studios at Mark, because my sort of boss right now, she used to deal with all the small studios that didn't have a rep.

2270
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:25,642
[SPEAKER_08]: So we got this one they're advertising for, Guys Gone Crazy.

2271
02:21:25,942 --> 02:21:26,262
[SPEAKER_05]: I want...

2272
02:21:26,582 --> 02:21:29,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, and I'm buying you guys Eyes Gone Crazy.

2273
02:21:29,323 --> 02:21:31,583
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really freaking cheap, so we're buying that.

2274
02:21:31,643 --> 02:21:32,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they naked?

2275
02:21:32,223 --> 02:21:36,244
[SPEAKER_08]: That and Girls Gone Triple X Wild.

2276
02:21:36,364 --> 02:21:36,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I want that too.

2277
02:21:37,324 --> 02:21:38,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I want that.

2278
02:21:40,045 --> 02:21:42,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I want the girls one, but not the guys, because remember, men suck.

2279
02:21:43,826 --> 02:21:44,546
[SPEAKER_05]: I want both of them.

2280
02:21:47,447 --> 02:21:50,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Will we get to see some big black cock?

2281
02:21:50,848 --> 02:21:51,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

2282
02:21:52,008 --> 02:21:52,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2283
02:21:53,123 --> 02:22:05,595
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, did I tell you about the time when I was driving down past the movie theaters and there was the car that had the wax stuff written on the back shield that said, we're filming for Girls Gone Wild, show us your titties?

2284
02:22:07,356 --> 02:22:08,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you have shown your titties, Jamie?

2285
02:22:09,718 --> 02:22:10,019
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2286
02:22:12,481 --> 02:22:13,602
[SPEAKER_08]: They have the logo.

2287
02:22:13,622 --> 02:22:17,846
[SPEAKER_08]: They have actual car decals and shit that they can put on there.

2288
02:22:19,744 --> 02:22:20,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we done with this current topic?

2289
02:22:20,944 --> 02:22:22,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I have an idea for what we can do.

2290
02:22:22,625 --> 02:22:22,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

2291
02:22:23,245 --> 02:22:25,225
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fucking hungry.

2292
02:22:25,305 --> 02:22:27,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take questions from the chatroom.

2293
02:22:27,145 --> 02:22:27,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2294
02:22:27,785 --> 02:22:30,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so chatroom, you're going to ask us questions.

2295
02:22:31,606 --> 02:22:36,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything you want to ask us in the chatroom, and we'll answer them on air.

2296
02:22:36,407 --> 02:22:37,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything you want to ask us.

2297
02:22:37,367 --> 02:22:40,248
[SPEAKER_07]: And remember, I'm drunk, so I'm going to be very open right now.

2298
02:22:40,768 --> 02:22:42,768
[SPEAKER_07]: So ask us a question and we'll answer it.

2299
02:22:46,069 --> 02:22:48,609
[SPEAKER_07]: In the meantime, I'm going to open up the mailbag and see if we have anything.

2300
02:22:50,475 --> 02:22:52,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're waiting for some questions in the chat room.

2301
02:22:55,438 --> 02:22:56,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing personal.

2302
02:22:56,338 --> 02:22:58,779
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't be about, like, a specific, like, other person.

2303
02:22:58,799 --> 02:23:04,522
[SPEAKER_07]: They can be about one of the three of us, but they can't be about, like, why do we like or not like so-and-so.

2304
02:23:11,573 --> 02:23:15,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the only reason I wanted to go to the Rage... Oh, wow, I'm getting a ton of stuff over private message.

2305
02:23:15,335 --> 02:23:15,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

2306
02:23:16,095 --> 02:23:25,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I was going to go to the Rage tonight with Brad and Irene and everybody, but, you know, because I have work tomorrow, and we would be out until 2 in the morning.

2307
02:23:26,621 --> 02:23:32,944
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm okay with, you know, being out that late, but, you know, I'm kind of tired right now because I haven't eaten anything all day, so I'm kind of indecisive.

2308
02:23:33,224 --> 02:23:40,608
[SPEAKER_08]: But then again, the last time, you know, if everyone remembers my story, like last week, I think about the guy trying to, you know, proposition me for sex.

2309
02:23:40,628 --> 02:23:45,551
[SPEAKER_08]: That happened on a Sunday night at the Rage, so, you know, I could go and get more material for the show.

2310
02:23:45,851 --> 02:23:51,754
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's, you know, it's that whole, you know, weighing the situation there, but I don't know.

2311
02:23:52,074 --> 02:23:55,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus, I might see that one... No, that'd be wrong, because then I'd be cheating on my girlfriend.

2312
02:23:55,836 --> 02:23:55,896
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2313
02:23:57,257 --> 02:23:58,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you can always look at the menu.

2314
02:23:58,719 --> 02:24:01,742
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking about this one chick that used to go.

2315
02:24:02,303 --> 02:24:03,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Her name was Nicole.

2316
02:24:03,063 --> 02:24:07,288
[SPEAKER_08]: She was the one that's like an ex-stripper, like has things pierced and that kind of thing.

2317
02:24:07,949 --> 02:24:09,631
[SPEAKER_08]: She used to go to the Rage all the time on Sunday nights.

2318
02:24:10,492 --> 02:24:10,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

2319
02:24:11,533 --> 02:24:12,814
[SPEAKER_08]: You should just go to faces on that.

2320
02:24:12,974 --> 02:24:14,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting some material for the show.

2321
02:24:14,235 --> 02:24:15,576
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting questions from the chatroom.

2322
02:24:15,596 --> 02:24:16,056
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys ready?

2323
02:24:16,277 --> 02:24:16,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

2324
02:24:16,697 --> 02:24:17,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, here we go.

2325
02:24:17,297 --> 02:24:17,838
[SPEAKER_07]: First question.

2326
02:24:17,878 --> 02:24:21,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Should I get some music for answering questions here?

2327
02:24:21,380 --> 02:24:21,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Barry!

2328
02:24:21,601 --> 02:24:22,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Jill Sandwich.

2329
02:24:24,403 --> 02:24:26,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really dizzy right now.

2330
02:24:26,084 --> 02:24:27,665
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys ought to forgive me.

2331
02:24:29,006 --> 02:24:35,311
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're just joining us, tonight's the drunk show and I've been drinking a little bit, so... Yeah, I know.

2332
02:24:35,371 --> 02:24:35,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing.

2333
02:24:36,672 --> 02:24:37,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here we go.

2334
02:24:37,232 --> 02:24:38,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2335
02:24:38,914 --> 02:24:39,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2336
02:24:40,905 --> 02:24:41,766
[SPEAKER_07]: First question.

2337
02:24:43,588 --> 02:24:45,990
[SPEAKER_25]: It was all hell.

2338
02:24:46,030 --> 02:24:50,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Dwen wants to know, who is a real bonafide lesbian in the studio?

2339
02:24:52,896 --> 02:24:56,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, since I said fuck all men, I might as well just go lesbian.

2340
02:24:56,640 --> 02:24:59,883
[SPEAKER_09]: He handed the microphone to Tina like she's a bonafide lesbian.

2341
02:25:00,512 --> 02:25:01,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you a bonafide lesbian?

2342
02:25:02,134 --> 02:25:02,814
[SPEAKER_09]: I will tell you the truth.

2343
02:25:02,854 --> 02:25:05,156
[SPEAKER_09]: There isn't one bonafide lesbian in this house.

2344
02:25:05,877 --> 02:25:07,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a bonafide lesbian, okay?

2345
02:25:08,359 --> 02:25:10,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Matt is a bonafide lesbian.

2346
02:25:10,581 --> 02:25:11,863
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you're just a boner.

2347
02:25:12,023 --> 02:25:15,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in an alternate universe where he had a sex change.

2348
02:25:16,195 --> 02:25:16,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Message to Boner.

2349
02:25:17,195 --> 02:25:19,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, next question from Twen.

2350
02:25:19,676 --> 02:25:21,897
[SPEAKER_07]: How come we don't talk about big white cock?

2351
02:25:22,577 --> 02:25:24,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Because white people don't have big cocks.

2352
02:25:24,698 --> 02:25:25,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, that's it.

2353
02:25:26,559 --> 02:25:29,200
[SPEAKER_09]: They're up there with the Asian answer right there.

2354
02:25:29,240 --> 02:25:29,840
[SPEAKER_07]: It was easy.

2355
02:25:30,260 --> 02:25:30,881
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell?

2356
02:25:30,921 --> 02:25:31,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Asian.

2357
02:25:32,141 --> 02:25:35,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Twen also asks, am I sexy?

2358
02:25:35,622 --> 02:25:37,143
[SPEAKER_07]: And he sends a picture of himself.

2359
02:25:37,223 --> 02:25:41,004
[SPEAKER_07]: I can already tell you the answer is no, but let's open the picture just to humor him.

2360
02:25:41,965 --> 02:25:43,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Twen sexy?

2361
02:25:43,085 --> 02:25:44,005
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

2362
02:25:47,796 --> 02:25:49,297
[SPEAKER_07]: That's better than the last pic I saw.

2363
02:25:49,317 --> 02:25:52,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Being honest, he's not, I wouldn't say he's sexy, but he's not ugly.

2364
02:25:53,622 --> 02:25:55,363
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got an old navy shirt, that's cute.

2365
02:25:55,824 --> 02:25:56,965
[SPEAKER_07]: He has a chance.

2366
02:25:57,926 --> 02:25:59,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't fuck him, but whatever.

2367
02:25:59,347 --> 02:26:00,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

2368
02:26:00,528 --> 02:26:03,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody stop, stop the show, stop the press, there's an announcement.

2369
02:26:04,372 --> 02:26:05,593
[SPEAKER_09]: I cut the cola cam.

2370
02:26:06,974 --> 02:26:09,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I suck your, Irene, I have a question, can I suck your dick?

2371
02:26:09,897 --> 02:26:10,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.

2372
02:26:11,258 --> 02:26:12,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Too late, I already did.

2373
02:26:14,062 --> 02:26:14,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

2374
02:26:14,602 --> 02:26:15,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

2375
02:26:16,504 --> 02:26:16,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

2376
02:26:16,884 --> 02:26:21,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's answer some more questions from the chatroom.

2377
02:26:21,507 --> 02:26:23,268
[SPEAKER_07]: 23 Magus wants to know, where is Mr. Spanky?

2378
02:26:23,288 --> 02:26:25,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Spanky is on hold this week because he's not popular.

2379
02:26:25,890 --> 02:26:29,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Spanky is actually chained up in Rob's closet.

2380
02:26:29,413 --> 02:26:30,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Twin sent us another pic.

2381
02:26:30,393 --> 02:26:31,794
[SPEAKER_07]: He wants to know if he's sexy in this pic.

2382
02:26:32,715 --> 02:26:37,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the same closet that holds his clothes monster in it?

2383
02:26:38,099 --> 02:26:38,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2384
02:26:38,939 --> 02:26:39,520
[SPEAKER_07]: EOSFVB.

2385
02:26:39,560 --> 02:26:39,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Question.

2386
02:26:40,760 --> 02:26:41,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Question.

2387
02:26:42,037 --> 02:26:44,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Daredevil, the movie, comes out on Valentine's Day.

2388
02:26:45,020 --> 02:26:46,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Will it be a make-out flick?

2389
02:26:47,562 --> 02:26:47,762
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2390
02:26:48,923 --> 02:26:50,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, because it's incredibly boring.

2391
02:26:51,365 --> 02:26:51,805
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd wish.

2392
02:26:52,286 --> 02:26:59,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think too many people are going to see it because that's a really fucking awesome comic as is, and I don't think they should make it a movie.

2393
02:27:00,613 --> 02:27:04,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I would see it just from the nerdy thing, but I wouldn't go down and say.

2394
02:27:05,657 --> 02:27:07,278
[SPEAKER_05]: I would wait until it came to DVD.

2395
02:27:09,170 --> 02:27:10,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's going to be a make-out flick.

2396
02:27:10,631 --> 02:27:13,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going to be a blowjob in the back row movie.

2397
02:27:13,152 --> 02:27:15,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going to be a vomit flick.

2398
02:27:16,433 --> 02:27:16,873
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going.

2399
02:27:19,054 --> 02:27:20,034
[SPEAKER_05]: What, for the blowjob?

2400
02:27:20,174 --> 02:27:22,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe just like a theater flick.

2401
02:27:24,216 --> 02:27:25,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we have another question.

2402
02:27:26,076 --> 02:27:30,918
[SPEAKER_07]: MoreThanJake543 wants to know, Why do my parents cry when I ask them questions?

2403
02:27:31,818 --> 02:27:32,979
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because you scare them.

2404
02:27:33,619 --> 02:27:35,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, take off the mask when you ask them questions.

2405
02:27:36,445 --> 02:27:36,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Mughal Hunter

2406
02:28:06,311 --> 02:28:10,016
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, Ula Ulazu, who's pointless?

2407
02:28:11,117 --> 02:28:11,438
[SPEAKER_07]: You are.

2408
02:28:12,699 --> 02:28:13,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

2409
02:28:14,061 --> 02:28:18,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Dark Tetsuya, Loki, how come you know so much about prawn?

2410
02:28:19,910 --> 02:28:20,270
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't.

2411
02:28:20,330 --> 02:28:23,811
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have this wonderful ability to make myself... I'm good at bullshitting.

2412
02:28:24,731 --> 02:28:25,991
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it is.

2413
02:28:26,671 --> 02:28:31,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Other than that, I get a lot of Playboy videos just because of my work.

2414
02:28:31,272 --> 02:28:32,773
[SPEAKER_08]: I get a lot of everything, actually.

2415
02:28:33,713 --> 02:28:35,813
[SPEAKER_08]: But really, I don't own that much porn at all.

2416
02:28:36,774 --> 02:28:42,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything I own, I've gotten from my work, so that's not saying much, but I don't know.

2417
02:28:42,255 --> 02:28:45,315
[SPEAKER_08]: I just make myself sound like I know a lot more about stuff than I actually do.

2418
02:28:45,516 --> 02:28:45,956
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty cool.

2419
02:28:46,196 --> 02:28:46,776
[SPEAKER_08]: You fake it.

2420
02:28:48,396 --> 02:28:49,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Like an orgasm.

2421
02:28:49,596 --> 02:28:50,537
[SPEAKER_09]: I have had a cry.

2422
02:28:50,637 --> 02:28:53,017
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys have drank almost all my Midori.

2423
02:28:53,037 --> 02:28:55,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want my butt?

2424
02:28:55,998 --> 02:28:57,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, next question.

2425
02:28:58,498 --> 02:28:58,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Change that.

2426
02:28:58,998 --> 02:29:02,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Chubbs wants to know, when is the next drunk show?

2427
02:29:03,299 --> 02:29:03,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Tomorrow.

2428
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:06,980
[SPEAKER_05]: When I'm drunk and do a fuck off.

2429
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,680
[SPEAKER_07]: The next drunk show is President's Day, right?

2430
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:10,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the day before President's Day.

2431
02:29:11,001 --> 02:29:11,421
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm off.

2432
02:29:11,801 --> 02:29:12,521
[SPEAKER_07]: If Jamie's off.

2433
02:29:13,141 --> 02:29:13,661
[SPEAKER_07]: We can get you off.

2434
02:29:13,681 --> 02:29:14,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie likes to get off.

2435
02:29:14,702 --> 02:29:16,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Which means that I'll be sleeping on the couch over here.

2436
02:29:18,106 --> 02:29:18,366
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2437
02:29:18,486 --> 02:29:19,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Just log in tomorrow.

2438
02:29:19,707 --> 02:29:20,667
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have a drunk show.

2439
02:29:21,808 --> 02:29:23,668
[SPEAKER_05]: I might have to come for that drunk show.

2440
02:29:24,169 --> 02:29:25,849
[SPEAKER_09]: I was actually just kidding to get them to log in.

2441
02:29:25,869 --> 02:29:26,650
[SPEAKER_07]: We have another question.

2442
02:29:27,070 --> 02:29:30,831
[SPEAKER_07]: CM Iguana wants to know, what's better, cherry or vanilla Coke?

2443
02:29:31,492 --> 02:29:31,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Vanilla.

2444
02:29:34,529 --> 02:29:37,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I think JB is now my god, if she can find me that.

2445
02:29:59,597 --> 02:29:59,937
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2446
02:30:00,417 --> 02:30:02,938
[SPEAKER_07]: CM Iguana also wants to know, am I sexy?

2447
02:30:02,998 --> 02:30:03,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's his picture.

2448
02:30:04,279 --> 02:30:06,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, big black cock.

2449
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:08,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing.

2450
02:30:08,520 --> 02:30:09,241
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that was the link.

2451
02:30:09,521 --> 02:30:10,141
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the link.

2452
02:30:10,161 --> 02:30:10,881
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the person.

2453
02:30:10,901 --> 02:30:15,343
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the link to uglypeople.com, and I'll post the link for all of you so you can have the shock that we just did.

2454
02:30:16,003 --> 02:30:16,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2455
02:30:17,644 --> 02:30:18,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Next question.

2456
02:30:18,644 --> 02:30:19,225
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is again.

2457
02:30:19,265 --> 02:30:22,566
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks kind of like Mr. T. No, Mr. T looks better.

2458
02:30:23,391 --> 02:30:24,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Subway Fatter.

2459
02:30:24,392 --> 02:30:29,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the Asian Harry Potter wants to know, why don't you like bag?

2460
02:30:30,255 --> 02:30:31,416
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good question.

2461
02:30:31,516 --> 02:30:32,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't dislike bag.

2462
02:30:32,937 --> 02:30:35,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like bag because it sounds like haggis.

2463
02:30:36,359 --> 02:30:38,160
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think Revenge is capable of much more.

2464
02:30:38,220 --> 02:30:42,663
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds, it's just, it's not very DDR-ish.

2465
02:30:42,743 --> 02:30:45,444
[SPEAKER_07]: It's bagpipes and it's throw up.

2466
02:30:45,665 --> 02:30:46,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear.

2467
02:30:46,425 --> 02:30:47,045
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gross.

2468
02:30:47,225 --> 02:30:48,786
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not my bag, baby.

2469
02:30:48,826 --> 02:30:50,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's just not my bag, baby.

2470
02:30:50,467 --> 02:30:51,108
[SPEAKER_07]: What can I say?

2471
02:30:53,444 --> 02:30:54,365
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, what to expect?

2472
02:30:54,925 --> 02:30:57,086
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, revenge is all the multicultural people.

2473
02:30:57,366 --> 02:30:58,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it, I need a waffle.

2474
02:30:59,788 --> 02:31:01,028
[SPEAKER_08]: I am hungry for waffles.

2475
02:31:01,068 --> 02:31:01,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Here, have some.

2476
02:31:01,549 --> 02:31:02,449
[SPEAKER_08]: I am buying waffles.

2477
02:31:02,849 --> 02:31:03,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Have some waffles.

2478
02:31:03,790 --> 02:31:04,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go looking for waffles.

2479
02:31:05,851 --> 02:31:06,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go get waffles.

2480
02:31:07,352 --> 02:31:09,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I need waffles after the show because we can't get alcohol.

2481
02:31:10,494 --> 02:31:11,254
[SPEAKER_05]: How much, how many?

2482
02:31:12,355 --> 02:31:12,615
[SPEAKER_07]: We got...

2483
02:31:13,965 --> 02:31:15,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we got way more questions.

2484
02:31:15,607 --> 02:31:16,728
[SPEAKER_07]: We just got a ton of questions to go.

2485
02:31:16,748 --> 02:31:17,228
[SPEAKER_07]: This is good.

2486
02:31:17,869 --> 02:31:23,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Vidpower wants to know, Will you stick your cock into your GameCube and attempt to play Animal Crossing with your cock?

2487
02:31:25,876 --> 02:31:26,096
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2488
02:31:27,738 --> 02:31:28,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Hydra.

2489
02:31:29,319 --> 02:31:30,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody else want to answer that?

2490
02:31:33,837 --> 02:31:35,038
[SPEAKER_08]: It would never fit in there.

2491
02:31:35,858 --> 02:31:39,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Hydra wants to know if we can see him in the tree outside our house.

2492
02:31:39,900 --> 02:31:40,640
[SPEAKER_07]: You fool!

2493
02:31:40,980 --> 02:31:42,841
[SPEAKER_07]: There are no trees in California!

2494
02:31:45,502 --> 02:31:46,543
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding, no.

2495
02:31:49,284 --> 02:31:51,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2496
02:31:51,665 --> 02:31:54,106
[SPEAKER_07]: 23rd Magus wants to know, Loki, what the hell?

2497
02:31:54,927 --> 02:31:55,787
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell, Loki?

2498
02:31:55,847 --> 02:31:57,408
[SPEAKER_07]: What is your line of work anyway?

2499
02:31:58,835 --> 02:32:00,396
[SPEAKER_08]: I sell movies to video stores.

2500
02:32:00,456 --> 02:32:04,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I'm... I'm... As she walks into the microphone cord.

2501
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:08,623
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm key account sales for a chain of stores called Movie Gallery.

2502
02:32:08,683 --> 02:32:11,526
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a Midwest, East Coast chain.

2503
02:32:11,546 --> 02:32:13,147
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like Blockbuster in Hollywood.

2504
02:32:13,508 --> 02:32:16,370
[SPEAKER_08]: And I talk to stupid shits that work at those stores all day long.

2505
02:32:17,171 --> 02:32:21,955
[SPEAKER_08]: And I sell the movies and deal with issues that they have, like misshipments, shortages, whatnot.

2506
02:32:22,515 --> 02:32:31,318
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I do, and because I do that, I get spiffs from different studios for selling movies to the stores, and I also get, um, you know, tons of movies for free.

2507
02:32:32,758 --> 02:32:33,238
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my job.

2508
02:32:33,738 --> 02:32:34,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, cool.

2509
02:32:35,079 --> 02:32:41,080
[SPEAKER_07]: JB wants to know, Will you play the song I sent, X1, Wet Wet Wet?

2510
02:32:41,901 --> 02:32:42,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll think about it.

2511
02:32:44,521 --> 02:32:44,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2512
02:32:45,522 --> 02:32:46,222
[SPEAKER_07]: More than Jake.

2513
02:32:48,797 --> 02:32:51,300
[SPEAKER_07]: What's yellow and blue and at the bottom of the pool?

2514
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:53,902
[SPEAKER_07]: A baby with slashed floaters!

2515
02:32:57,406 --> 02:33:00,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you stick a baby into a blender feet first?

2516
02:33:01,811 --> 02:33:03,473
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can see its expression!

2517
02:33:07,449 --> 02:33:11,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that's right folks, kill your kids while they're young so that we don't have to suffer with them.

2518
02:33:11,870 --> 02:33:12,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, another question.

2519
02:33:13,250 --> 02:33:19,791
[SPEAKER_07]: EvilNauki2DX wants to know, why do the dancing cacti from the background video of Guacamole Del Taco give me nightmares?

2520
02:33:21,932 --> 02:33:23,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they're out to steal your soul.

2521
02:33:24,092 --> 02:33:25,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they're playing Samba De Amigo.

2522
02:33:25,952 --> 02:33:31,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Because after you play that song, you have seven days to live, and the last thing you'll see is the cactus.

2523
02:33:32,934 --> 02:33:33,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven days?

2524
02:33:34,054 --> 02:33:35,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not six days?

2525
02:33:36,983 --> 02:33:37,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoa!

2526
02:33:37,563 --> 02:33:38,704
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't park that way.

2527
02:33:40,324 --> 02:33:40,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

2528
02:33:43,205 --> 02:33:46,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Stressa wants to know, Rob, do you think I'm sexy?

2529
02:33:47,726 --> 02:33:49,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I think you're sexy.

2530
02:33:49,547 --> 02:33:50,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's fuck right now.

2531
02:33:50,827 --> 02:33:51,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Get over here.

2532
02:33:51,727 --> 02:33:54,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Step into my office, because you're fucking fired.

2533
02:33:58,596 --> 02:34:03,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Except you don't swing my way, so we'll never fuck, so I can joke with you like that.

2534
02:34:03,939 --> 02:34:05,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, when are we getting that apartment together?

2535
02:34:05,740 --> 02:34:06,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Or house?

2536
02:34:06,340 --> 02:34:10,243
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it depends on the financial situation I'm in with this house.

2537
02:34:10,263 --> 02:34:11,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2538
02:34:11,883 --> 02:34:12,504
[SPEAKER_07]: No styling!

2539
02:34:14,028 --> 02:34:16,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is the head leader in Orange Lounge?

2540
02:34:16,049 --> 02:34:17,911
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, who's behind every planned show?

2541
02:34:18,351 --> 02:34:18,891
[SPEAKER_07]: We all are.

2542
02:34:18,951 --> 02:34:20,272
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a three-way.

2543
02:34:20,953 --> 02:34:22,674
[SPEAKER_07]: It's myself, DarkSakura, and Loki.

2544
02:34:23,654 --> 02:34:24,375
[SPEAKER_07]: We're a three-way.

2545
02:34:24,395 --> 02:34:25,276
[SPEAKER_07]: We're a giant orgy.

2546
02:34:25,696 --> 02:34:27,197
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't have my own chair or mic.

2547
02:34:28,498 --> 02:34:33,401
[SPEAKER_07]: His second question is, who's the most random person in the chat room?

2548
02:34:33,501 --> 02:34:34,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat Cookie.

2549
02:34:34,502 --> 02:34:37,684
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'd say Maple, because he talks only occasionally.

2550
02:34:37,724 --> 02:34:38,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, he just comes out of nowhere.

2551
02:34:38,985 --> 02:34:39,585
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's me.

2552
02:34:39,605 --> 02:34:39,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Bam!

2553
02:34:39,985 --> 02:34:40,626
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Maple.

2554
02:34:40,646 --> 02:34:41,026
[SPEAKER_05]: It's me.

2555
02:34:42,247 --> 02:34:43,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the most random person in the chat room.

2556
02:34:44,548 --> 02:34:44,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey!

2557
02:34:44,648 --> 02:34:45,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2558
02:34:45,349 --> 02:34:48,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, when he gave you your Christmas present, you wanted to fuck him.

2559
02:34:48,790 --> 02:34:49,950
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true, I did want to fuck him.

2560
02:35:15,751 --> 02:35:19,934
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have respect for the... When I got my Christmas present, I wanted to fuck them.

2561
02:35:20,995 --> 02:35:21,935
[SPEAKER_05]: My present.

2562
02:35:22,376 --> 02:35:23,656
[SPEAKER_05]: More like the man in my present.

2563
02:35:24,017 --> 02:35:25,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, this is a good question.

2564
02:35:25,538 --> 02:35:31,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Hydra wants to know... Hydra wants to know, is there a Santa Claus?

2565
02:35:35,148 --> 02:35:39,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there is a Santa Claus and every year he comes and attacks our city.

2566
02:35:39,549 --> 02:35:41,630
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why we have the Protective Dome.

2567
02:35:41,650 --> 02:35:44,251
[SPEAKER_08]: It's from Invader Zone.

2568
02:35:49,770 --> 02:35:51,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are little yellow-green pills.

2569
02:35:51,651 --> 02:36:00,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are... So do I take the green pill, and I go to the Matrix, and then the white, yellowish pill, and I go... They're the same.

2570
02:36:00,356 --> 02:36:03,478
[SPEAKER_05]: They're both yellow and green, and they'll just fuck with your head.

2571
02:36:05,359 --> 02:36:08,220
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet the listeners love it when we're having two different conversations on each mic.

2572
02:36:08,801 --> 02:36:09,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, alright, new question.

2573
02:36:15,364 --> 02:36:17,326
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not allowed to tell any more dead baby jokes.

2574
02:36:17,366 --> 02:36:17,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop sending them.

2575
02:36:19,770 --> 02:36:25,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Naoki2DX says, does Love Love Sugar make you want to be all giggly like a damn schoolgirl?

2576
02:36:26,095 --> 02:36:33,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, before that question is answered, if anybody says any more dead baby jokes... Tina, I said I'm putting a ban on the dead baby jokes, don't worry.

2577
02:36:33,922 --> 02:36:34,482
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you will.

2578
02:36:34,963 --> 02:36:36,524
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can kick my ass, that's a sad thing.

2579
02:36:36,564 --> 02:36:40,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's listen to Love Sugar real fast, just so you guys can be familiar with it.

2580
02:36:45,037 --> 02:36:46,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I haven't heard it.

2581
02:36:46,618 --> 02:36:48,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, does that make you want to be all giggly like a damn school?

2582
02:36:48,980 --> 02:36:50,401
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that makes me want to kill people.

2583
02:36:53,623 --> 02:36:53,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2584
02:36:55,024 --> 02:36:57,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I have a car now, I vote for vehicular homicide.

2585
02:36:57,985 --> 02:37:00,127
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it just makes me want to look for more hentai.

2586
02:37:02,268 --> 02:37:03,789
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes me want to... I hate hentai at work, too.

2587
02:37:03,929 --> 02:37:05,650
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes me want to jerk off on your head.

2588
02:37:05,831 --> 02:37:06,651
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't get that often.

2589
02:37:08,993 --> 02:37:09,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I can buy something.

2590
02:37:12,515 --> 02:37:13,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

2591
02:37:20,160 --> 02:37:21,041
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'm getting pictures.

2592
02:37:21,081 --> 02:37:22,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a picture from Stressa.

2593
02:37:23,102 --> 02:37:24,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's a cute picture from Stressa.

2594
02:37:25,464 --> 02:37:27,125
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a cute picture of Stressa and Angel.

2595
02:37:30,927 --> 02:37:39,413
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we have... Okay, that's one of Hydra's songs I promised I'd play later.

2596
02:37:39,433 --> 02:37:40,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, VidPower.

2597
02:37:40,113 --> 02:37:41,995
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an excellent question from VidPower.

2598
02:37:42,788 --> 02:37:47,551
[SPEAKER_07]: What is up with that guy sitting cross-legged in the stoic video for 2DX?

2599
02:37:48,311 --> 02:37:49,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, it's Tack.

2600
02:37:51,594 --> 02:37:51,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't.

2601
02:37:52,234 --> 02:37:52,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Question.

2602
02:37:53,154 --> 02:37:53,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Tack.

2603
02:37:54,775 --> 02:37:55,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

2604
02:37:55,556 --> 02:37:55,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

2605
02:37:57,897 --> 02:38:00,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Chatcookie wants to know if I want his chocolate chips.

2606
02:38:02,080 --> 02:38:03,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh baby, you know it.

2607
02:38:05,022 --> 02:38:09,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Hydra says, mmm, that's not a question.

2608
02:38:13,435 --> 02:38:17,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Twen wants to know... No, I'm not going to dignify that question.

2609
02:38:17,697 --> 02:38:19,157
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, that's a little bit across the line.

2610
02:38:20,718 --> 02:38:21,878
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no more dead baby jokes.

2611
02:38:21,918 --> 02:38:24,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Get over it.

2612
02:38:24,939 --> 02:38:29,021
[SPEAKER_07]: JB wants to point out that the Ricky Martin song that's on DDREX is redone by SyFam.

2613
02:38:29,061 --> 02:38:29,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2614
02:38:29,781 --> 02:38:33,282
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, go back to the fuck you music, because I actually do have a fuck you that I have to say.

2617
02:38:35,663 --> 02:38:37,103
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this is in regards to JB.

2618
02:38:37,643 --> 02:38:38,244
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, hold on.

2619
02:38:38,304 --> 02:38:38,944

[SPEAKER_07]: uh... here it is

2621
02:38:52,469 --> 02:39:02,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I put in an order at Half.com for Evil Zone because I'm generous and nice and I wanted to give it to JB because very few people appreciate that game the way that we do.

2622
02:39:03,179 --> 02:39:05,041
[SPEAKER_05]: The person cancelled my order.

2623
02:39:05,441 --> 02:39:06,001
[SPEAKER_05]: The fuck?

2624
02:39:06,522 --> 02:39:07,323
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know what I did?

2625
02:39:07,843 --> 02:39:09,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I ordered another one for just as cheap.

2626
02:39:11,066 --> 02:39:12,828
[SPEAKER_05]: So, fuck them, I got another one.

2627
02:39:13,708 --> 02:39:14,089
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

2628
02:39:17,708 --> 02:39:26,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay Back to the questions More than Jake wants to know Oops, wrong song How many roads must a man walk down?

02:39:26,420 --> 02:39:30,786
[SPEAKER_07]: 42 In a row Why can't I have an afro?

2630
02:39:30,826 --> 02:39:31,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it because I'm white?

2631
02:39:32,187 --> 02:39:33,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes Good enough

2632
02:39:35,615 --> 02:39:36,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Get a perm.

2633
02:39:36,695 --> 02:39:42,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Twin wants to know, what is it when I message him with an underscore and then a pipe and an underscore?

2634
02:39:42,597 --> 02:39:43,417
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that symbol?

2635
02:39:43,437 --> 02:39:46,078
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll type it in the chat room for those that don't know what I'm talking about.

2636
02:39:46,638 --> 02:39:47,558
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that symbol?

2637
02:39:48,058 --> 02:39:49,079
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a middle finger.

2638
02:39:50,279 --> 02:39:50,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

2639
02:39:51,319 --> 02:39:51,699
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm drunk.

2640
02:39:52,720 --> 02:39:53,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have a better explanation?

2641
02:39:53,520 --> 02:39:54,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a better explanation, Twin.

2642
02:39:55,180 --> 02:39:56,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at your hand, face your palm toward you.

2643
02:39:57,461 --> 02:39:58,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Now turn it the other way.

2644
02:39:59,181 --> 02:40:02,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Fold down your pinky and the finger next to it.

2645
02:40:02,722 --> 02:40:04,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Fold down your index finger and your thumb.

2646
02:40:05,343 --> 02:40:06,784
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what everybody is telling you.

2647
02:40:09,405 --> 02:40:12,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Bombay wants to know, is the guy in the stoic video tack?

2648
02:40:12,926 --> 02:40:13,406
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

2649
02:40:14,147 --> 02:40:14,787
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the rumor.

2650
02:40:15,387 --> 02:40:21,630
[SPEAKER_07]: 23rd Magus wants to know, Jamie, would you hunt me down and kill me if I did the stoic video dance during a party?

2651
02:40:22,530 --> 02:40:23,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Too stoic, of course.

2652
02:40:23,691 --> 02:40:23,911
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2653
02:40:25,611 --> 02:40:25,851
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

02:40:39,258 --> 02:40:39,758
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not.

2658
02:40:40,879 --> 02:40:42,541
[SPEAKER_07]: JB says, tell Jamie I do not.

2659
02:40:42,601 --> 02:40:44,742
[SPEAKER_18]: I just BS everything, para para paradise.

2660
02:40:45,143 --> 02:40:47,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that's the end of the... JB, you're welcome.

2661
02:40:47,464 --> 02:40:47,945
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

2662
02:40:48,205 --> 02:40:49,546
[SPEAKER_07]: End of question and answer segment.

2663
02:40:49,566 --> 02:40:49,946
[SPEAKER_07]: We're done.

2664
02:40:50,947 --> 02:40:54,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're going to play a Bomani original.

2665
02:40:54,089 --> 02:40:55,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it's not a Bomani song.

2666
02:40:55,190 --> 02:40:59,433
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an original work by Hydra, who's a new fellow that's been in our chat room lately.

2667
02:41:00,454 --> 02:41:06,636
[SPEAKER_07]: And after that, we're going to play something from a group called X1, who JB tells me might be Papaya under a new name.

2668
02:41:06,757 --> 02:41:07,317
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see.

2669
02:41:07,797 --> 02:41:08,417
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll play that.

2670
02:41:08,457 --> 02:41:10,378
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll play those, and then we'll be right back.

2671
02:41:10,458 --> 02:41:11,979
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll start this off on the original work.

2672
02:41:11,999 --> 02:41:16,420
[SPEAKER_07]: This is DJ Hydra with Hydra's Wrath, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2680
02:46:51,097 --> 02:46:53,779
[SPEAKER_20]: This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

2681
02:46:57,681 --> 02:46:59,402
[SPEAKER_07]: That was jazz in that promo.

2682
02:46:59,462 --> 02:47:01,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I want him to come back and visit.

2683
02:47:01,263 --> 02:47:02,063
[SPEAKER_07]: He's cool.

2684
02:47:02,083 --> 02:47:03,804
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so tired because I haven't eaten anything.

2685
02:47:03,904 --> 02:47:04,705
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just like, ugh.

2686
02:47:04,925 --> 02:47:07,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know some of the boys and girls are going over to Taco Bell.

2687
02:47:08,107 --> 02:47:09,508
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a boycott against Taco Bell.

2688
02:47:09,568 --> 02:47:10,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, Taco Bell gives me diarrhea.

2689
02:47:12,149 --> 02:47:13,250
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't like Mexican food.

2690
02:47:14,232 --> 02:47:14,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you racist?

2691
02:47:15,352 --> 02:47:16,713
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I just don't like Mexican food.

2692
02:47:17,193 --> 02:47:17,713
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all good.

2693
02:47:18,813 --> 02:47:20,674
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting into the last stretch of the show.

2694
02:47:21,054 --> 02:47:22,474
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm starting to sober up a little bit.

2695
02:47:22,494 --> 02:47:24,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still a little dizzy.

2696
02:47:24,995 --> 02:47:26,095
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to make me another shot, babe?

2697
02:47:26,796 --> 02:47:27,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Who are you on the phone with, Jamie?

2698
02:47:28,716 --> 02:47:29,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie's calling her man.

2699
02:47:30,677 --> 02:47:31,717
[SPEAKER_07]: The man, Dan.

2700
02:47:33,798 --> 02:47:34,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2701
02:47:36,818 --> 02:47:37,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2702
02:47:37,559 --> 02:47:38,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, Jamie's going to get waffles?

2703
02:47:39,707 --> 02:47:40,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm getting waffles.

2704
02:47:41,089 --> 02:47:42,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you and Jamie going out for waffles?

2705
02:47:42,131 --> 02:47:43,052
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going out for waffles.

2706
02:47:43,112 --> 02:47:43,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Where at?

2707
02:47:43,974 --> 02:47:45,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably Denny's, it's the only place open.

2708
02:47:46,117 --> 02:47:46,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that sucks.

2709
02:47:47,439 --> 02:47:49,302
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to go out for waffles, except I'm going dancing.

2710
02:47:50,069 --> 02:47:57,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanna go dancing, but I have to- I'm on the prowl, because I've been single for far too long, and it's time for me to get some nookie.

2711
02:47:58,113 --> 02:48:00,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's been- oh my god, when was the last time I got laid?

2712
02:48:00,775 --> 02:48:04,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, not that we wanna talk about this on the radio, but I'm drunk, so it's okay.

2713
02:48:05,838 --> 02:48:07,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, shit.

2714
02:48:07,879 --> 02:48:10,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably since, like, the end of September?

2715
02:48:10,921 --> 02:48:11,821
[SPEAKER_07]: That's sad, huh?

2716
02:48:11,861 --> 02:48:18,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, unfortunately, when I go to frickin' The Rage on, uh, Sunday nights, I don't know what it is, but it's like-

2717
02:48:19,165 --> 02:48:21,327
[SPEAKER_08]: My ass is a magnet for horny gay guys.

2718
02:48:21,407 --> 02:48:22,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what it is.

2719
02:48:23,008 --> 02:48:23,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Loki.

2720
02:48:27,652 --> 02:48:28,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Go, go.

2721
02:48:28,233 --> 02:48:29,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie spilled drink.

2722
02:48:31,536 --> 02:48:36,540
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I'm taking, so.

2723
02:48:36,560 --> 02:48:38,001
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not down with the gay, though, Loki?

2724
02:48:38,021 --> 02:48:39,102
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not.

2725
02:48:39,263 --> 02:48:40,303
[SPEAKER_07]: That's too bad.

2726
02:48:40,484 --> 02:48:41,144
[SPEAKER_07]: That's alright, though.

2727
02:48:42,746 --> 02:48:44,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, shit!

2728
02:48:44,527 --> 02:48:45,328
[SPEAKER_07]: I spilled on me.

2729
02:48:45,408 --> 02:48:46,609
[SPEAKER_07]: What's in this drink, Jamie?

2730
02:48:50,649 --> 02:48:51,049
[SPEAKER_05]: How is it?

2731
02:48:54,151 --> 02:48:54,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob's wearing it.

2732
02:48:56,832 --> 02:48:57,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it okay?

2733
02:48:58,974 --> 02:48:59,654
[SPEAKER_07]: It was sticky.

2734
02:49:00,434 --> 02:49:01,455
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to wash my hands.

2735
02:49:02,896 --> 02:49:04,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you guys keep the show going while I go wash my hands?

2736
02:49:04,737 --> 02:49:05,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it tastes okay.

2737
02:49:06,258 --> 02:49:06,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Rob.

2738
02:49:06,798 --> 02:49:10,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make you... Rob looks like he pissed himself.

2739
02:49:11,620 --> 02:49:15,803
[SPEAKER_08]: You do realize that's the chair that he spilled alcohol in and rubbed it off with his ass?

2740
02:49:17,228 --> 02:49:17,929
[SPEAKER_08]: I've cleaned it off.

2741
02:49:18,269 --> 02:49:19,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Haha, see sucker.

2742
02:49:21,774 --> 02:49:24,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, yeah.

2743
02:49:25,439 --> 02:49:29,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we should, um, let's play a two person match game.

2744
02:49:30,326 --> 02:49:33,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Rob spilled blank on his pants.

2745
02:49:38,286 --> 02:49:38,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2746
02:49:39,366 --> 02:49:39,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Stupid.

2747
02:49:39,887 --> 02:49:42,967
[SPEAKER_08]: You gotta say, Rob got blank all over his pants.

2748
02:49:43,268 --> 02:49:47,269
[SPEAKER_05]: When Rob was really drunk, he blanked all over his pants.

2749
02:49:50,470 --> 02:49:51,930
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not going anywhere.

2750
02:49:52,110 --> 02:49:52,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Chatroom, what do you say?

2751
02:49:52,991 --> 02:49:53,991
[SPEAKER_05]: What did Rob do to his pants?

2752
02:49:54,611 --> 02:49:56,052
[SPEAKER_08]: I already know what he did to his pants.

2753
02:49:56,152 --> 02:49:57,372
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is a different situation.

2754
02:49:57,452 --> 02:49:58,112
[SPEAKER_05]: We're pretending.

2755
02:49:58,992 --> 02:49:59,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, he's back.

2756
02:49:59,813 --> 02:50:00,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I want waffles.

2757
02:50:00,513 --> 02:50:01,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I want waffles too.

2758
02:50:02,614 --> 02:50:04,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, he's like fisting your ass.

2759
02:50:04,734 --> 02:50:05,654
[SPEAKER_05]: He was fisting your ass.

2760
02:50:09,696 --> 02:50:12,897
[SPEAKER_07]: I was out in the living room giving everyone a big hug.

2761
02:50:13,937 --> 02:50:16,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know, what did the chat room think of the drunk show?

2762
02:50:16,458 --> 02:50:20,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Should we do this again or was this a big, fat, fucking train wreck?

2763
02:50:20,940 --> 02:50:24,401
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we're ever going to do this again because this is too much of a train wreck.

2764
02:50:24,421 --> 02:50:26,202
[SPEAKER_07]: This show had no organization.

2765
02:50:26,262 --> 02:50:30,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the show as it is has no organization, but this was like even worse.

2766
02:50:30,144 --> 02:50:31,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, stop making me drinks.

2767
02:50:34,265 --> 02:50:35,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, one more drink, that's it.

2768
02:50:36,926 --> 02:50:38,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to know what the chatroom thought of this show.

2769
02:50:40,206 --> 02:50:43,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, they're actually liking it.

2770
02:50:43,347 --> 02:50:44,727
[SPEAKER_07]: What is wrong with you guys?

2771
02:50:45,627 --> 02:50:48,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, what's in this drink, Jamie?

2772
02:50:51,188 --> 02:50:51,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Drink it.

2773
02:50:54,589 --> 02:50:54,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Drink.

2774
02:50:55,989 --> 02:50:56,689
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have any thoughts.

2775
02:50:57,509 --> 02:50:59,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop pressuring me!

2776
02:50:59,709 --> 02:51:02,490
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't drink, you won't be cool!

2777
02:51:03,317 --> 02:51:04,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Drink, drink, chug, chug, chug, chug.

2778
02:51:07,120 --> 02:51:07,521
Wait, wait.

2779
02:51:07,541 --> 02:51:07,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2780
02:51:08,461 --> 02:51:14,827
[SPEAKER_02]: EOSFVB is suggesting... Suggesting... Shut your mouth.

2781
02:51:17,109 --> 02:51:22,153
[SPEAKER_07]: He's suggesting that we should do an E-Tards episode where we all drop ecstasy and make out.

2782
02:51:22,453 --> 02:51:23,334
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

2783
02:51:24,995 --> 02:51:25,396
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2784
02:51:25,616 --> 02:51:26,016
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2785
02:51:26,837 --> 02:51:27,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Make out with him.

2786
02:51:27,638 --> 02:51:28,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Make out with him.

2787
02:51:33,045 --> 02:51:35,866
[SPEAKER_05]: One, two... Stop laughing!

2788
02:51:37,727 --> 02:51:39,707
[SPEAKER_03]: He's laughing like a baby!

2789
02:51:39,727 --> 02:51:40,667
[SPEAKER_03]: You laugh like girl!

2790
02:51:43,048 --> 02:51:43,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2791
02:51:43,989 --> 02:51:44,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Down the hatch.

2792
02:51:45,949 --> 02:51:46,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Breathe.

2793
02:51:46,529 --> 02:51:46,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Breathe, Rob.

2794
02:51:46,929 --> 02:51:48,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, don't look at the chatroom.

2795
02:51:49,070 --> 02:51:49,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Close your eyes.

2796
02:51:49,950 --> 02:51:50,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Close your eyes.

2797
02:51:50,390 --> 02:51:51,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Close your eyes.

2798
02:51:51,231 --> 02:51:51,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Close your eyes.

2799
02:51:52,371 --> 02:51:52,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Drink.

2800
02:51:58,053 --> 02:51:58,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2801
02:51:59,633 --> 02:52:01,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob has the tingly, twitchy look.

2802
02:52:02,768 --> 02:52:03,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Bitter beer face.

2803
02:52:04,470 --> 02:52:05,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how is it?

2804
02:52:06,392 --> 02:52:07,233
[SPEAKER_08]: It tastes like funny.

2805
02:52:07,774 --> 02:52:08,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

2806
02:52:08,975 --> 02:52:10,136
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't as good as the Midori?

2807
02:52:11,898 --> 02:52:13,180
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fine.

2808
02:52:13,280 --> 02:52:14,762
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked the last one better, actually.

2809
02:52:15,082 --> 02:52:16,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, the one with more peach?

2810
02:52:16,163 --> 02:52:16,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2811
02:52:17,445 --> 02:52:20,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Chubb says that we promised we'd do a drunk show on President's Day.

2812
02:52:20,308 --> 02:52:21,229
[SPEAKER_07]: He wants to come up here.

2813
02:52:22,210 --> 02:52:22,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2814
02:52:23,860 --> 02:52:27,482
[SPEAKER_07]: He's hoping that if he gets drunk enough, that he'll have his way with me.

2815
02:52:27,542 --> 02:52:28,083
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

2816
02:52:29,063 --> 02:52:29,543
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kidding.

2817
02:52:29,744 --> 02:52:30,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I watch?

2818
02:52:30,684 --> 02:52:32,185
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just trying to piss people off tonight.

2819
02:52:33,065 --> 02:52:35,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, VidPower wants to know when we're going to get a stripper on the show.

2820
02:52:38,209 --> 02:52:38,389
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2821
02:52:40,070 --> 02:52:40,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

2822
02:52:40,750 --> 02:52:41,010
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2823
02:52:41,871 --> 02:52:42,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

2824
02:52:42,751 --> 02:52:43,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

2825
02:52:43,392 --> 02:52:43,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

2826
02:52:44,532 --> 02:52:45,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

2827
02:52:45,573 --> 02:52:46,453
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, you too, Harry.

2828
02:52:49,335 --> 02:52:50,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Meanie, I'll get a razor.

2829
02:52:53,820 --> 02:52:55,300
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get you some Aussie Nads.

2830
02:52:57,381 --> 02:52:58,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Some Aussie Man?

2831
02:52:58,401 --> 02:52:58,641
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2832
02:52:59,142 --> 02:52:59,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Aussie Nads.

2833
02:52:59,902 --> 02:53:01,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I could go for some Aussie Man.

2834
02:53:01,682 --> 02:53:03,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what Aussie Nads are?

2835
02:53:03,223 --> 02:53:03,683
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2836
02:53:04,123 --> 02:53:04,323
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2837
02:53:05,463 --> 02:53:06,984
[SPEAKER_05]: It's... Oh, wait, Nads!

2838
02:53:07,024 --> 02:53:08,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's the stuff that... Yeah, hair removal.

2839
02:53:08,584 --> 02:53:09,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know what that is.

2840
02:53:09,525 --> 02:53:11,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I just didn't know it was Aussie Nads.

2841
02:53:12,966 --> 02:53:15,466
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Stresso wants to come up and get drunk on the next show, too.

2842
02:53:15,486 --> 02:53:18,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, yes, you can come, but only if I can have my way with you.

2843
02:53:18,727 --> 02:53:20,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.

2844
02:53:21,920 --> 02:53:25,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I would pay to see that.

2845
02:53:25,162 --> 02:53:28,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Now he also says that if you take a razor to your balls, it hurts.

2846
02:53:29,625 --> 02:53:31,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't know, I've never shaved down there.

2847
02:53:31,767 --> 02:53:33,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you try to castrate yourself so you'd sound like a lady?

2848
02:53:33,928 --> 02:53:37,350
[SPEAKER_08]: I know guys that do, but I just... You gotta really wonder how the porn stars do that.

2849
02:53:37,370 --> 02:53:41,333
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some parts of your body... I don't know why they can't be sharp like that down there.

2850
02:53:41,633 --> 02:53:45,335
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there's seriously some parts of your body that you just need to take what God gave you.

2851
02:53:45,556 --> 02:53:47,677
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew a guy when I lived in Alabama who was a stripper.

2852
02:53:48,638 --> 02:53:50,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Who was an epilady.

2853
02:53:50,339 --> 02:53:50,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Was he gay?

2854
02:53:52,754 --> 02:53:53,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Was he hot?

2855
02:53:53,535 --> 02:53:54,255
[SPEAKER_05]: He was the one I dated.

2856
02:53:55,795 --> 02:53:56,696
[SPEAKER_07]: You dated a gay guy.

2857
02:54:00,817 --> 02:54:01,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, go on.

2858
02:54:02,378 --> 02:54:03,278
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hot, tell me.

2859
02:54:03,538 --> 02:54:04,379
[SPEAKER_05]: He was an epilady.

2860
02:54:06,199 --> 02:54:07,100
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what an epilady is?

2861
02:54:09,120 --> 02:54:15,983
[SPEAKER_05]: It was back, they had these, they stopped making them for a while because it was, no, it was called an epilady.

2862
02:54:16,023 --> 02:54:21,225
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like an electric razor, only it had these little wires coming out with coils wrapped around it, and it plucked the hairs out.

2863
02:54:22,122 --> 02:54:22,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Just plugged him out.

2864
02:54:23,723 --> 02:54:30,026
[SPEAKER_05]: And, yeah, I tried using that thing on my ankles for a while and I would get ingrown hairs because the thing was so shitty.

2865
02:54:30,546 --> 02:54:33,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you imagine if you got ingrown hairs on your balls?

2866
02:54:33,388 --> 02:54:34,808
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be the worst thing ever.

2867
02:54:35,469 --> 02:54:37,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2868
02:54:37,169 --> 02:54:38,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, what was I going to say?

2869
02:54:39,050 --> 02:54:40,231
[SPEAKER_08]: I have Jackass the movie.

2870
02:54:40,531 --> 02:54:42,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone mentioned we should do a Jackass video.

2871
02:54:43,172 --> 02:54:43,893
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got the movie.

2872
02:54:43,913 --> 02:54:44,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck Jackass the movie.

2873
02:54:44,953 --> 02:54:45,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck it.

2874
02:54:46,514 --> 02:54:49,095
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the... He's like a toy car possessed.

2875
02:54:49,175 --> 02:54:49,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the fortune cookie?

2876
02:54:51,400 --> 02:54:51,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it is.

2877
02:54:55,604 --> 02:54:56,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me.

2878
02:55:00,889 --> 02:55:02,290
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're towards the end of the show.

2879
02:55:02,370 --> 02:55:06,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's time to take everybody's... We're there.

2880
02:55:06,134 --> 02:55:10,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go around the room and take everybody's final thought of the day.

2881
02:55:10,939 --> 02:55:11,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up, woman!

2882
02:55:14,662 --> 02:55:15,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we there yet?

2883
02:55:15,483 --> 02:55:15,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we there yet?

2884
02:55:15,863 --> 02:55:16,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we there yet?

2885
02:55:16,244 --> 02:55:17,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we there yet?

2886
02:55:17,244 --> 02:55:18,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I haven't spoken much on the radio.

2887
02:55:18,406 --> 02:55:18,806
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not real radio.

2888
02:55:18,826 --> 02:55:20,087
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not real radio.

2889
02:55:20,367 --> 02:55:20,928
[SPEAKER_07]: We're internet radio.

2890
02:55:39,292 --> 02:55:40,833
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, just to say that.

2891
02:55:41,173 --> 02:55:42,614
[SPEAKER_18]: Most of this show is like mainly drunk.

2892
02:55:43,715 --> 02:55:46,557
[SPEAKER_18]: Drunk revolution or something like that.

2893
02:55:46,577 --> 02:55:53,182
[SPEAKER_18]: With you drinking all the... Yeah, Rob was just straight funny on this one.

2894
02:55:53,842 --> 02:55:54,403
[SPEAKER_25]: Hyrule.

2895
02:55:58,245 --> 02:55:59,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't made out with anybody.

2896
02:55:59,566 --> 02:56:02,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe when I go to the club I'll get to make out with some folks.

2897
02:56:02,228 --> 02:56:02,729
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be fun.

2898
02:56:02,949 --> 02:56:04,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I did get to grow boobies, so thank you, James.

2899
02:56:05,999 --> 02:56:20,512
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see, since I can't be on the show Sunday, or next Sunday afterwards, depends on my schedule, but my upcoming school that's starting right now, it's about to start on Tuesday, well, I'll probably be there next February.

2900
02:56:25,276 --> 02:56:28,639
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, and let's see, thoughts about today.

2901
02:56:33,331 --> 02:56:34,011
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Dead Air.

2902
02:56:34,731 --> 02:56:36,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas, if you think of anything else, we'll come back to you.

2903
02:56:36,432 --> 02:56:37,152
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I'll come back.

2904
02:56:37,232 --> 02:56:37,832
[SPEAKER_18]: Just come back to me.

2905
02:56:37,913 --> 02:56:39,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thoughts of the day.

2906
02:56:41,514 --> 02:56:47,075
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to stop playing Animal Crossing and finish my website so I can get stuff up for people to download.

2907
02:56:47,215 --> 02:56:47,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew it.

2908
02:56:48,236 --> 02:56:49,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew it was Animal Crossing.

2909
02:56:50,016 --> 02:56:50,737
[SPEAKER_07]: It was doing it to you.

2910
02:56:51,457 --> 02:57:00,580
[SPEAKER_18]: Speaking of websites, Loki, I need to know your AOL messenger screen name so I can send some of my DWF files to you sometime.

2911
02:57:02,887 --> 02:57:05,329
[SPEAKER_08]: This website has an uploader on it.

2912
02:57:05,369 --> 02:57:06,109
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do it yourself.

2913
02:57:06,129 --> 02:57:07,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2914
02:57:08,570 --> 02:57:09,571
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, that's cool.

2915
02:57:09,751 --> 02:57:10,512
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll accept that.

2916
02:57:14,674 --> 02:57:16,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we need strippers on this show.

2917
02:57:16,235 --> 02:57:26,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I need to make a trip over to the strip club, because it's been a long time, and I was actually reading reviews last night of strip clubs, and supposedly, um, school club centerfolds, you get the steamiest lap dances there.

2918
02:57:28,362 --> 02:57:28,963
[SPEAKER_18]: Strippers?

2919
02:57:29,003 --> 02:57:30,704
[SPEAKER_18]: I can hire a few people, a few strippers.

2920
02:57:31,923 --> 02:58:00,841
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to do Orange Lounge Live from the strip club Wait till I'm not here Okay, Orange Lounge Live from the strip club I'm sorry, but I would rather see real boobs than fake boobs I think that real boobs are better I'll just get some people with real boobs If I can touch it, it's real enough for me It's like that same story Your breasts feel so weird Because they're real I've actually touched real boobs and fake boobs before Is there a difference?

2921
02:58:01,758 --> 02:58:03,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you.

2922
02:58:03,422 --> 02:58:04,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, definitely.

2923
02:58:04,845 --> 02:58:05,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.

2924
02:58:05,326 --> 02:58:10,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I know for a fact because we took... I took pictures before with... There's these two models from...

2925
02:58:12,259 --> 02:58:17,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Some bike magazine, like, when we went to Harley Davidson's show, they had, like, some bike there.

2926
02:58:17,805 --> 02:58:19,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Easy Rider show, that's what it was.

2927
02:58:19,567 --> 02:58:28,036
[SPEAKER_08]: We took a picture with the Easy Rider, some of the couple girls from it, and their breasts were all fake and stuff, so they had, you know, they were sitting on my lap and stuff.

2928
02:58:28,416 --> 02:58:33,682
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can tell they just feel, like, a lot firmer, like, a little unnaturally firm.

2929
02:58:34,202 --> 02:58:34,463
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just...

2930
02:58:35,263 --> 02:58:38,184
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, it's just not soft, it's just firm.

2931
02:58:38,745 --> 02:58:42,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it like the difference between a waveless waterbed and a regular waterbed?

2932
02:58:43,647 --> 02:58:48,709
[SPEAKER_08]: I've just had a regular waterbed, so I would imagine probably, yeah.

2933
02:58:50,630 --> 02:58:52,491
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I haven't touched bricks for a while.

2934
02:58:55,393 --> 02:58:58,735
[SPEAKER_08]: But I hear now, though, they have the ones that, you know, they do feel natural.

2935
02:58:58,795 --> 02:59:00,897
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never felt that way.

2936
02:59:01,817 --> 02:59:08,081
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm never going to have a need for any type of enhancement, so I have to ask these questions I'll never find out on my own.

2937
02:59:08,882 --> 02:59:10,022
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, just stay natural.

2938
02:59:10,403 --> 02:59:20,349
[SPEAKER_08]: My girlfriend, she's still got, like, you know, issues with her self-image, where she thinks she's... She says she wants to get her boobs done, and I was like, no, you don't need to.

2939
02:59:20,649 --> 02:59:20,809
[SPEAKER_18]: Why?

2940
02:59:20,829 --> 02:59:21,470
[SPEAKER_18]: What's wrong with her boobs?

2941
02:59:21,490 --> 02:59:23,311
[SPEAKER_05]: If she put on 10 pounds, she'd gain more boobs.

2942
02:59:24,171 --> 02:59:24,792
[SPEAKER_18]: What's wrong with the boots?

2943
02:59:24,812 --> 02:59:25,573
[SPEAKER_08]: She doesn't want to do that.

2944
02:59:25,613 --> 02:59:28,395
[SPEAKER_08]: She wants to be thin with bigger breasts.

2945
02:59:28,435 --> 02:59:32,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm saying she doesn't need to do that, but she wants to.

2946
02:59:32,800 --> 02:59:33,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

2947
02:59:33,260 --> 02:59:34,101
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to stop her.

2948
02:59:35,222 --> 02:59:43,290
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, actually, from my experience working at GNC and everything, there are actually some herbs that you can take that increase your hormones, that increase breast size.

2949
02:59:44,491 --> 02:59:45,272
[SPEAKER_18]: We all know about that.

2950
02:59:45,512 --> 02:59:47,514
[SPEAKER_08]: She's taking enough drugs as it is right now.

2951
02:59:49,013 --> 02:59:49,793
[SPEAKER_18]: It's all natural.

2952
02:59:50,454 --> 02:59:53,375
[SPEAKER_06]: We're running long, so I just need to get everybody's final thought.

2953
02:59:53,515 --> 02:59:54,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you done with your final thought, Loki?

2954
02:59:54,996 --> 02:59:55,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2955
02:59:55,516 --> 02:59:55,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie.

2956
02:59:57,937 --> 02:59:58,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, bye.

2957
03:00:00,658 --> 03:00:04,460
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is I'm drunk as fuck and we're not going to be doing this again for a long time.

2958
03:00:04,860 --> 03:00:05,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Chubbs, you suck.

2959
03:00:05,800 --> 03:00:09,282
[SPEAKER_07]: You were supposed to be here drinking with me, but no, I understand the poor thing because I'm poor too.

2960
03:00:09,882 --> 03:00:12,083
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, that's it for now.

2961
03:00:13,204 --> 03:00:18,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually, I might get really drunk tonight when I get home and go live until 2 a.m.

2962
03:00:18,968 --> 03:00:19,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

2963
03:00:20,229 --> 03:00:26,614
[SPEAKER_07]: I said actually the station is going to be live until... Well, you'll have to try and kick me off, I think.

2964
03:00:26,974 --> 03:00:29,896
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm going to be going out, so... When I get back, though, you can go live, I don't know.

2965
03:00:31,518 --> 03:00:32,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, well, let's see.

2966
03:00:35,601 --> 03:00:36,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway.

2967
03:00:37,182 --> 03:00:38,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think that's it for now.

2968
03:00:39,504 --> 03:00:40,004
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything else?

2969
03:00:41,005 --> 03:00:41,686
[SPEAKER_18]: Not that, no.

2970
03:00:41,746 --> 03:00:42,466
[SPEAKER_18]: Everything's fine.

2971
03:00:42,626 --> 03:00:44,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, hope you enjoyed the drunk show, boys and girls.

2972
03:00:44,948 --> 03:00:46,069
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it, we're signing off.

2973
03:00:52,805 --> 03:00:55,767
[SPEAKER_27]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2974
03:00:56,328 --> 03:00:59,470

2977
03:01:12,420 --> 03:01:12,781

[SPEAKER_21]: Now!

2980
03:01:15,042 --> 03:01:17,804
[SPEAKER_21]: Move that melon of yours and get the paper if you can.

2981
03:01:18,165 --> 03:01:20,887
[SPEAKER_21]: Pulling that gargantuan cranium about.

2982
03:01:21,789 --> 03:01:25,790
