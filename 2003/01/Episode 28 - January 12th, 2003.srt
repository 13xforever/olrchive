1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What, uh, what should we expect from your routine today? Is it a big secret? No? Can you give us any details before you go?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
One word. Shades.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Message for you, son!

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Attention!

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Do you want to hear the most annoying fan in the world?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Orange Lounge may contain adult content, Orange Lounge may contain many 4-letter words.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity. Orange Lounge may contain hot-monkey sex.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot-monkey sex.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In this episode...

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What's your favorite scary movie?

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Showgirls.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Absolutely frightening.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What's yours?

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There are no stupid questions.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Just stupid people.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Don't torture yourself.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That's my job.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now's the time on sprockets and we dogs.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'll get you my pretty and your little dog too.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
For no good food.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry but all questions must be submitted in writing.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Why did they have to take the word game?

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No!

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
No!

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No!

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No!

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No!

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
No!

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No!

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No!

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
No!

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No!

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No!

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
No!

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
No!

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
No! Nobody expects us, finally takes the position.

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's kendo.

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hey!

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Dark Sakurai.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Shut up!

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Where's my gun?

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This is my boomstick.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Sky.

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

47
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Loki.

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

49
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What kind of working and being would find that funny?

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,880
We are live!

52
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,120
And this is episode number 28 for January the 12th of 2003

53
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:01,120
You're tuned into the BEES!

54
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,620
Manisine's most shade-sy radio station of all things

55
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:09,660
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky. Joining me, as always, are my

56
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,320
awesome

57
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,480
co-hosts, well one's invisible at the second. He isn't here yet. That would be

58
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,020
Loki

59
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,900
within your yet

60
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,620
the others right here and she's she's perky as always right

61
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:26,700
i'm wanting to do this particular show and michael jack

62
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,500
say hello to dark chakra

63
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,580
and some of these at the door

64
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,980
did you bring hot man sex with you

65
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,660
yes hot man sex is a bad person ok we'll get to that later

66
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,680
uh... this episode of the twenty-eight will be doing the fremont

67
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,680
attorney wrap-up, and you'll have to excuse us in advance. We're all a little out of it today.

68
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,680
Two of us have had headaches, one of us has been coughing, and one of us is late!

69
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,680
Say hello to Loki, there he is. Does that mean I'm having a baby?

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,680
Only if your water

71
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,680
breaks, I don't know. We're just really freaking tired after yesterday.

72
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,680
I'm feeling better, though. I was in a really pissy mood,

73
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,680
but I saw destruction on the way here, so I was happy.

74
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,680
always fun.

75
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,600
only $1.99 and actually what's kind of funny is this says that this is a baby

76
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:53,720
coyote now to my knowledge coyotes do not look like ferrets I don't understand

77
00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:01,040
how this is a coyote or whatever at that um that long so we went to the yes the

78
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:09,280
fuck my diet at the Walgreens at the longs that we went to in Fremont they had

79
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,800
gigantic ones of these. I almost got one.

80
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,880
And don't forget, yesterday there was a horse, and we'll hear about that in the interviews

81
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,560
a little later. Oh, what, you mean Hot Man Sex?

82
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,300
No, not Hot Man Sex, the actual horse that Corey had that was, you know, made for a man

83
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,120
but pH balanced for a woman type thing. Yeah.

84
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,300
Anyway, yeah, it's going to be one of those shows. Darkticity summed it up right there.

85
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:38,040
Happy 24th, by the way. Where's my donut?

86
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,040
Let's say hello to Maureen's studio guests before we get to the first break.

87
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:53,040
Wow, there's chaos going on here. I feel like I'm in the middle of Gumby's routine. Jesus.

88
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,040
Say hello to Brad.

89
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Another step has entered the game.

90
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,040
Say hello to Irene.

91
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Hi guys!

92
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,040
And Dave is over there too. Dave, say hi.

93
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Hi.

94
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,040
Dave, you look like a monk.

95
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
You know it, baby.

96
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
All right, baby.

97
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
All right.

98
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
We better go to break right now.

99
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
Now's a good time.

100
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,520
Let's do a break with some, we'll do a break with some songs from Extreme, because Extreme

101
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,840
is spreading across the country like a bad case of herpes.

102
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,520
It's extremely extreme.

103
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,000
Soon to be in your neighborhood.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,960
Yeah, Rob spread it.

105
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,240
Hi guys, you're listening to Orange Jones Radio.

106
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
you

107
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,240
Oh

108
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,240
I don't want to lose you

109
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,240
And I don't want to lose you

110
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
I don't want to lose you

111
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:11,240
Here's one of my favorite tracks.

112
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:41,240
by request, this is V, the Xtreme Edit.

113
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:24,560
Hi everybody, this is DSCS.

114
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,520
Make sure to visit SoCalKicks.com and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

115
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,940
We finally accomplished ultimate evolution just now.

116
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,700
And then you make the horses have sex.

117
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,460
Oh, wait, are we live?

118
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,340
Yes, I just turned the mics on.

119
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,340
And then you make the horses have sex.

120
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,300
You pick your horses and they breed.

121
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,300
They go off into the distance.

122
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,640
You breed the horses for real?

123
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,000
They go off into the distance and there's a dramatic fade out.

124
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,980
And I see you see the mommy horse and the baby horse.

125
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,600
And the baby horse goes, hi, I'm the baby horse.

126
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,880
You get to name me.

127
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,780
So I named my hot man sex.

128
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,780
All right.

129
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,100
Mommy, where do baby horses come from?

130
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,020
Yeah, we're talking about Derby Owners Club.

131
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,020
Virtual horses.

132
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,020
I'll own you.

133
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,020
That game is crack.

134
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,020
Breathe.

135
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,020
Um, I'm...

136
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,020
My horse is...

137
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,020
And then I name mine Takumi, and uh, yeah.

138
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,020
No, you don't have any horses.

139
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,020
I know, I just...

140
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,020
But then, but then you train your horses...

141
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,020
I thought that Ryosuke could own Takumi easily.

142
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,020
You train your horsies, and then...

143
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,020
It's like that code.

144
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:24,540
And then you make them run around, and then you drown them, like Matt did.

145
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,260
I drowned my horse three times, and I was being mean.

146
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,020
For those that are completely lost right now...

147
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,020
My horse likes bananas.

148
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,940
talking about a new game, a somewhat new game, called Derby Owners Club. Now this game, it's

149
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:43,820
worse than DDR. It is a bigger drug than DDR ever is. It's kind of like, it's kind of like

150
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:52,320
DDR is like, DDR is kind of like, I don't know, like, DDR is kind of like pot, and Derby

151
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,320
Owners Club is kind of like just straight up smack. Because like, the straight up smack

152
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,620
is way more expensive, and there's not as much to it, you know, you just kind of take

153
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:09,640
the smack, you know, you don't have to worry about...anyway, the point I'm trying to make,

154
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,800
what the hell is Derby Owners Club? It's like these big, just giant seizure buttons you

155
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:21,760
use to beat your horse, and you throw $2.50 into the machine each time, and you just beat

156
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,120
them and you bond with them. That's all Derby Owners Club is. And yet, I find myself strangely

157
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,120
We're going to tell everybody our horses, but mine are last. Rob, what's your horse's name?

158
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,120
My horses are out on the car still, I believe. Or, I don't know, but my horses, I have Miss Thang, which I made in Irvine.

159
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,120
And then I have Beaver Fever, which I made last night in Milpitas.

160
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,120
Okay, I've got BJ, the horse I made in Irvine.

161
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,120
I have Cloud, the horse I jacked from the little girl in Irvine.

162
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:00,120
And then I have the two horses I made in Milpitas last night. We have Big Black Cock and Mr. Spanky.

163
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,120
And Mr. Spanky's being an ass, so I beat the shit out of him.

164
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,120
He wanted the coconut, but he wasn't good enough, so I gave him the hay.

165
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,120
So that's it.

166
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:18,120
We're being corrected in the chat room. Derby Owners Club at Milpitas Golf Line actually costs $2.25 a game. Sorry, Milton!

167
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,120
Not that you're making any horse, then it's three.

168
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,580
haha

169
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,180
uh-huh

170
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,920
it being a quarter of peace

171
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,800
yeah anyway

172
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,640
anyway my life it's expensive anyway

173
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,840
i have my first sources of Slytherin chaser is all black and he's really

174
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,380

175
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,700
then my next horse

176
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,160

177
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,240

178
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,320
and then next one is hot man sex

179
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,320
That was my best horse. I won third place with that one.

180
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,320
Then my next horse is Mmm Fajitas.

181
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,320
And my fifth horse is Jin Kazama.

182
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,320
So you spent like thirty dollars on this game or something?

183
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
Twelve.

184
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,320
Twelve? Wow, wait. You had like five cards though.

185
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,320
That's three dollars times five is fifteen.

186
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,320
I had two of my games paid for and then Matt lent me money.

187
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,320
Thank you.

188
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,320
Oh great, now you have other people buying you drugs.

189
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,320
That's when you know you're addicted.

190
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,320
Pretty soon you're going to be going to meetings.

191
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
Oh, I'm sorry.

192
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
Excuse me.

193
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Anyway, well, Jamie has left the building.

194
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
Oh, and I get the chair.

195
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
Let's just go around the room and talk about our week.

196
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
Because we don't really have any structured Orange Islands Radio.

197
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
I know we've got a lot of new people joining us tonight.

198
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
They're tuning into here tonight's Fremont interviews.

199
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,120
interviews, and we will get to those in just a sec, but welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

200
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:52,760
We're Bee-mani Talk Radio, we talk about DDR2DX, Big Black Cocks, masturbating with cake mix,

201
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:58,580
and all sorts of various random things, basically, that have nothing to do with each other. No,

202
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,340
we try to talk about Bemani, but obviously, if we were able to actually talk three hours

203
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,480
every week about Bemani, we are in really sad shape and have no life, so things get

204
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,000
really random on this program, so enjoy the randomness, and come into our chat room.

205
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:23,360
makes the ratings go up. Yes, and randomness makes ratings go up. Go to our website, orangelounge.skie.cx

206
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,400
and join in the chat because our chat room is insane. And play nice in the chat tonight,

207
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,720
kids. Play nice. Or we'll beat you. Or we'll whip you just like Mr. Spanky. We'll whip

208
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,720

209
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,920

212
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,480
with a dang

213
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,600

215
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,320

00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
I'm allergic to snacks.

217
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
Damiana makes you horny.

218
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,880
Hey, you know what we oughta do?

219
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,960
Let's all go run out and smoke an ecstasy cigarette and come back and do the show and

220
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,960
see what happens.

221
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:18,640
It smells like my mom's lasagna or something.

222
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
You are a dick.

223
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,920
These are yummy donuts.

224
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,440
Smells like old antique store.

225
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,440
It does.

226
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
Ew.

227
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:36,440
The ingredients are Damiana, Wild Lettuce, Catnip, Passion Flower, Mint, Love, and Light

228
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
What's that?

229
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,440
And uh, manufactured by X-Men Z Incorporated.

230
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,440
What is love?

231
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,440
Baby don't hurt me.

232
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,440
In Beverly Hills.

233
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
Don't hurt me no more.

234
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
And these are made by hippies.

235
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,440
Let's have some, some um, crack.

236
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,520
If I try out these cigarettes and I get horny, is anybody gonna help me out here?

237
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,600
Don't look at me, look at Irene.

238
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,120
She's not in here.

239
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,440
Don't look at me like that Brad, you're scaring me.

240
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
Joke.

241
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,440
Ew.

242
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,980
I thought I left the insects in the other room.

243
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,960
OK, so anybody else want to talk about their week,

244
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,460
something that happened this week?

245
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,560
Yes, Dave.

246
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,360
Dave.

247
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,640
I have finals next week, and it is crap.

248
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,840
Ha ha.

249
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,000
And I was like, mom, let me go to the show.

250
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,400
She's like, no, you have to study.

251
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,760
And I was like, dad, let me go to the show.

252
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,000
And he's like, OK, but you have to study later.

253
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,960
So my dad is cool.

254
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,320
But when I get home, I have to study for an hour and a half.

255
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,520
Study means open the book.

256
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
And have it in the music.

257
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,520
comic book that's really inside the book.

258
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,520
No, no, no, not that. Just open the book, stare into it blankly.

259
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,520
I'm just going to listen to Orange Lounge and just be like, hey, it's music.

260
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,520
And then I kind of wake up later and be like, yeah, I've been studying the whole time.

261
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,520
In high school, I didn't study, and look where it got me.

262
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,520
That's exactly why I am.

263
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,520
That's exactly the reason I am studying.

264
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,520
Why are you dressed like a monk?

265
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,520
Because I'm wearing...

266
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,520
I know it's not because you want to remain virginal for the rest of your life.

267
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:08,240
life wait wait wait look look look what I'm wearing oh what's that say it says

268
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:19,280
boo-boo oh I'm black now no no no no no I I have the big black cock now what is

269
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:29,320
this the Jewish boo-boo is that no jubu we will offend everyone you know that's

270
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,200
funny because there was a guy yesterday at Fremont that did a routine his name

271
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,120
was the Jew, made me think of you. That's not a good thing.

272
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:41,980
Well, Rob, I feel touched right here. I have to say, this guy did some very original

273
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,260
things. I have to commend that guy for having the balls to do what he did on that machine.

274
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:51,580
Very homoerotic original things. I bet when you watch the video, when you watch

275
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,940
the video, you're going to notice I'm the only one laughing at that routine.

276
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,700
Okay, keep in mind, keep in mind everybody had balls there yesterday.

277
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,940
yes for everybody at balls but this guy had really big balls to be doing back

278
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,700
stuff on everybody else to a normal day at a big black cock to go with them can

279
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,980
you show us rob

280
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,300
shows what he did

281
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,940
i'm stopping uh... u s bb ask an excellent question which relates to last

282
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,060
week's discussion did he with his cock out at the end of routine is i was

283
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,080
saying last week

284
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,740
nobody's done that yet and somebody needs to

285
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,620
and be the ultimate thing

286
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:26,300
no he did not with his car contracts are some people but i did almost a hit i did

287
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:32,040
almost get hit with his shirt. I had to kind of pick it off the table with my pen that

288
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:42,040
I was judging with. Speaking of shirts, you had a Twinkie yesterday. Ah, fuck. Ok, Nikkari,

289
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:49,960
if you're listening, you a bitch. No, seriously, Nikkari's great. He's a good guy. I like him

290
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,520
a lot. But I get to the tournament and I think I'm hot shit because Jamie and I, we ordered

291
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,800
shirts from the Engrish store, and I have my shirt that says, I hate myself and I want

292
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,200
to die, with the little rainbows and the stars.

293
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,920
I get there, I'm walking in, I'm wearing the shirt, and Jamie does this way better.

294
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,520
What's the first thing Nikkari does?

295
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:15,560
He runs out the door, he can't say it, he goes, oh no you didn't.

296
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:21,120
And pretty soon, here are Nikkari and I, and those of me out there that happen to know

297
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,100
me a little better than just the radio, and no Nikkari, know that Nikkari and I have something

298
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,840
in common that a lot of D.R. people don't have in common.

299
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,840
So it's just kind of, it made it a lot funnier that, hey, we happen to be wearing the same

300
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,840
shirt.

301
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,520
Too bad that exhibition didn't happen.

302
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,560
Yeah, we were supposed to do an exhibition P.A., but it didn't happen because he had

303
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,520
to go to work and I had to go get batteries to do the tape stuff.

304
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,280
Was Nikkari the Jew guy or was that different?

305
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
No, no, no, no.

306
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,600
No, no, completely different guy.

307
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,320
Now what did you rate that guy?

308
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,140
Did you give them like a 100?

309
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,480
I'm not allowed to reveal how I rated people, but if you want to see the judges' towers,

310
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,740
you can look at the results.

311
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,740
They're linked with the DDR3 thing.

312
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:05,360
I don't want to know about the judges' towers.

313
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:13,040
I don't need to know this, I'm an innocent, pure-hearted, oh fuck.

314
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,760
You're having to resort to Barry Propel.

315
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,720
You've got to tell, because the listeners that listen to Orange Lawn's radio know about

316
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:22,560
your love obsession with propel and yesterday what did you find next door to the tournament

317
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:29,480
berry flavored propel has been um dethroned as my favorite flavor of propel they have

318
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,480
peach flavor propelled because everyone knows i can drink a peach for hours actually i don't

319
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,980
remember what line that movie came from that i can eat that would be face off that's dan's

320
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,960
favorite movie which he actually broke by stepping on the laser disc so um but yeah

321
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,320
Yeah, he says that all the time with our Animal Crossing town, because we have peaches. But

322
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:59,320
I can drink peaches now. And look at Dan, seductively, go, I'm drinking a peach. Who?

323
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,240
Shut up. Okay. We're going to get to those Fremont interviews

324
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,960
in just a second here, but I wanted to have a serious moment here at the beginning of

325
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,000
the show. No, I want to have a serious moment here, because people died this week, and it

326
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,800
kind of sucks uh... one of the bt's passed away today

327
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,960

final

331
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,680
i like to be

332
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,600
i don't think it is a noble drop

333
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,840
besides um...

334
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,520
being a band

335
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,160
have no idea what the bt's are so maybe you could enlighten me

336
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,160
i'm too young

337
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,340

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,380
that's right that's right david shit you know i find it very funny that this is a

341
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,880
very serious thing i was looking at your yahoo thing

342
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,900
and i see how you have movies stars and

343
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,060
all this

344
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,640
and and mike

345
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,640
Excuse me.

346
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,640
How unladylike.

347
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,640
Congratulations.

348
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:22,360
And my yahoo, that one tasted like my dinner, and my yahoo has like world events, and when

349
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,600
the next Harry Potter movie is supposed to come out, important things, yeah, it has my

350
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,240
horoscope, it has my comics, but it has world events, important things that are going to

351
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:37,480
affect my children's children's children when the magnetic layer decides to erode and everybody

352
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,480
dies.

353
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,980
But your children shouldn't be having kids. I mean, they're so young and they shouldn't have sex.

354
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,980
I don't even have them yet!

355
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,980
I don't want children-

356
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,980
Ew! Fetal sex!

357
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,980
Ew!

358
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,980
No, I don't want children because they'll play with my toys.

359
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,980
It doesn't matter. You have to understand that the world has really nothing to fear because all the world's problems can be solved with nuclear weapons.

360
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,480
I mean, that's what we've learned from the movie The Core that's going to be coming out later on.

361
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:09,480
We learned, oh hey, if the Earth's pole stops rotating, and I honestly didn't realize that the core of the Earth was rotating,

362
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,480
I guess it is, so the movie said so, it must be true, so...

363
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,480
Hey, are you drunk, Matt? Your face is really red.

364
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,480
No.

365
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,480
He's not Asian, so pay for space to be red like that.

366
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,480
He's so excited, and he just can't hide it.

367
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,480
He's about to lose control and he thinks he likes it.

368
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,480
I'm just so excited.

369
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,480
What is this, the gas episode? Jesus.

370
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,480
Where?

371
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:37,880
Also, no, also seriously, another famous celebrity that died this week that's very, very sad.

372
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
Roxette?

373
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,880
No.

374
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
Damn it.

375
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,880
No, no.

376
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,880
She has cancer, but she's not dying yet.

377
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,880
No, this is bigger than that.

378
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
This is bigger than that.

379
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,080
Oolong the bunny died, ladies and gentlemen.

380
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,320
Oh my God!

381
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,520
Oolong the bunny, the bunny that balances-

382
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,260
Oh, it's JWTF!

383
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,560
The bunny that balances shit on its head.

384
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,560
I mean, Oolong was a pig, by the way.

385
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,560
In Dragon Ball.

386
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Okay, now you even got me on that one. I think I'm too young for that one, too.

387
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:09,560
It's an internet joke. Maybe somebody would be so kind to post the link to Oolong the Bunny so I can show some folks the pictures here.

388
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,560
I want to see the pictures of the dead bunny with all the little bunnies.

389
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,560
No, that's horrible!

390
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,560
I want to see it! I want to see it!

391
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,560
You're horrible! You're a horrible woman!

392
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,560
I want to see it! See, see, see!

393
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,560
Hopefully somebody in the chat room knows what I'm talking about when I talk about Oolong the Bunny.

394
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,560
Ah, bunnies just arrived at the cotton ball shoved up its ass.

395
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,560
My God!

396
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:34,520
You two know that you're the most popular host on this show in the chat room.

397
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,720
You know, that's from, I actually have a quote from a movie, that was from the movie Table

398
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,000
One I was talking about, a really shitty movie about these guys who wanted to open this restaurant

399
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
lounge.

400
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,440
Doesn't anyone understand that restaurant lounges don't survive?

401
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,600
In the movie, it didn't survive, so they turned it into a strip club, and that's why the movie

402
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
rocks.

403
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,320
This guy's going to talk about movies all night long, he's just like, so, yeah, um.

404
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,320
The president died and, oh man, this movie I saw the other night sucks, man.

405
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,320
Anybody? Come on.

406
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,320
And also, another thing that died was this segment.

407
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,320
And Charlie's Angels 2 is gonna suck ass. Duh.

408
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,320
The first one sucked ass. Why? Okay.

409
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,320
Okay, here's the trailer, okay?

410
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,320
They're on this bridge in this Russian, like, cargo truck thingy.

411
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,320
And there's a tank on one side, and a guy with an RPG on the other side.

412
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:29,320
So what they do, they're going to drive the truck off the freaking damn rocket-propelled grenade.

413
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,320
Dragon Warrior?

414
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,320
I can tell you why the second Charlie's Angels movie is going to suck.

415
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
Demi Moore's in it. Her career is over.

416
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,320
She belongs on the surreal life right now.

417
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:44,320
And they also took out, um, freaking, um...

418
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
What's his name?

419
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,320
The comedian?

420
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,320
Bill Murray.

421
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,320
Bill Murray's not in it, so that's why it's going to suck.

422
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:57,200
bernie mac is pretty funny

423
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,760
i don't know man

424
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,280
well it doesn't matter he doesn't really have a major part of the movie anyways

425
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,840
dave would know this uh...

426
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,640
don't be a menace

427
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,640
while drinking your juice or whatever

428
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,280
what? wasn't he a menace?

429
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,880
i have no idea what you're talking about come on you're our local ghetto jew

430
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,880
hi back to bemani hello yeah bemani

431
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,500
jamie's gonna go blow her nose okay that's fine

432
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:32,260
I've been given some lovely advanced MP3s from Cory the Sultan.

433
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,900
Cory the Sultan has given us some MP3s.

434
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,140
World premieres here right here.

435
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,780
You're not going to be able to hear them.

436
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,060
Can't download them.

437
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,060
Can't hear them anywhere else.

438
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,060
We've got them.

439
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,660
We're going to play them in this next break.

440
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,780
But I wanted to ask you guys that have played Extreme now this week.

441
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,780
It's been out for a week.

442
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,780
What do you guys think of Extreme?

443
00:27:48,780 --> 00:28:03,780
Well, you know, I really, really, really, really liked it at first, and now I'm like kind of, eh, it's cool and all, but I'm getting bored pretty fast, and that's bad. Bad that I'm losing interest this fast, and, you know, and we haven't even gotten ours yet, and I'm like, eh, whatever.

444
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:08,780
Rosalind doesn't count, fuckers!

445
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,780
Well, the game itself didn't suck, because I could...

446
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,780
It seems a hell of a lot easier to PA stuff, because I was...

447
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,780
Let him finish, we'll get back to this.

448
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,780
It's the pancake, buddy!

449
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,780
Let Black Lab finish.

450
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,780
Yes, let me finish! God, people!

451
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:54,780
Okay, yeah, so I played it, I didn't hear the songs, and I was still double A-ing stuff, because I was...

452
00:28:54,780 --> 00:29:00,780
All I could hear was the Max2 net right, like, 10 feet, or 10 inches away from it, so yeah.

453
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,780
It's easier to re-PA stuff on it.

454
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,780
Yeah.

455
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,780
You wanna know how I feel about Max?

456
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,780
Uh, I mean, sorry.

457
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,780
Extreme? Extreme?

458
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,780
Max 2+.

459
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,780
Jamie's out of nuts.

460
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,780
That's, uh, that's how I feel about it.

461
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,780
Okay, so back to this, what we brought up on the internet here,

462
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,780
I was given a link in the chatroom, thank you very much to yosfbb,

463
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:25,780
to the We Love Oolong page, which has Oolong the bunny balancing pancakes on its head here in the corner.

464
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:59,780
Please, can we have a serious moment, please?

465
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:09,780
Hokkaido, Japan. Oolong, the friend of children, bounds across the snow.

466
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,780
You bitch!

467
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,780
That verb was bumpsy, but very flavored Propel.

468
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,780
Go back YouTube, I'll be serious, I promise.

469
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,780
You'll be serious? You promise. You promise.

470
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,780
Happiness is a Japanese rabbit who rests pancakes on his hand.

471
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,780
Alright.

472
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,780
Oh my god, that's such a cute bunny.

473
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:39,780
He's a fucking gorgeous bunny and you all are really rude. You are rude people.

474
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,780
I don't know why I let you in my house. Okay.

475
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:50,780
So did he try to balance, like, say, I don't know, a ten-ton safe on his head, and is that what did him in, you know?

476
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,780
How did he die?

477
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,780
Let's, um...

478
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,780
We're gonna read another one? Hold on, hold on, here's another.

479
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,780
I don't know if I can trust you with reading these. All right, all right, here we go.

480
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,780
Shh! Shh!

481
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,780
Where is murder?

482
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:15,780
that's not what that's the person who wrote it

483
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:25,180
with big black

484
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,780
i'm still trying to figure out how this rabbit died it's like it had heart

485
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,220
failure or some shit like that heart failure my ass

486
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:35,180
it's a cover-up i say he's trying to balance the tenth unsafe on his fucking head

487
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,740
are you saying it faked its own death to sell more albums

488
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,240
yes

489
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,600
it's like the elvis of the burrito like to pop i think hiding when the secret

490
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,720
i'll be waiting for his return logan to block

491
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,100
but the hell

492
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,300

519
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,860
Our apologies. We're going to start this off with Graduation. After that, Sync for Extreme

520
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,860
and tears will wrap up this set.

521
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,580
Remember, all brands make a new Xtreme.

522
00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:01,580

523
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:28,440

524
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,440

I'm

526
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,440
I'm

527
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,440
I'm

528
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,440
I'm

529
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,440
I'm

530
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,440
I'm

531
00:38:51,440 --> 00:39:08,440
Orange Lounge Radio. We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

532
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:19,440
Um, is that a ferret in your pocket or are you just excited about the show?

533
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:25,440
It's actually a baby coyote in my pocket.

534
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,440
Whatever.

535
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,440
Don't mind me for a second. You guys have to fill while I get the tape queued up here.

536
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,440
Fill or fill or space. Fill or fill or space.

537
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,440
On the next episode of Dragon Ball Z, Goku gets a real gun shoved up his ass and he lives.

538
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
Wow!

539
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,440
And he goes like super duper say at level 28 and kills people.

540
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,440
You know what I don't understand is why they didn't bury the bunny in the pancake on its head.

541
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,440
That would have been funny.

542
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
Yeah, but they didn't even put a pancake on its head.

543
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
It had an orange on its belly.

544
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
So?

545
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
Not a pancake on its head.

546
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
It's famous for things on its head.

547
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
Not its belly.

548
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,440
He has dirt on his head.

549
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
He's balancing dirt.

550
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
And pushing up the daisies while he's at it.

551
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
Well, good for him.

552
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
I was a cute bunny, though. I had a sniffle.

553
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,440
See, now you see how mean you all were

554
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,440
while I was trying to read those haikus.

555
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,440
It was hilarious, all those random pictures were pretty funny on that site.

556
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:25,440
Do your dead bunny thing. We miss you terribly and hate that you are dead.

557
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,440
Oolong died but apparently came out to life in Animal Crossing because your new guy Coco or whatever looks like a dead bunny.

558
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,440
Did somebody leave for Coco to show up? Who left?

559
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,440
Maddie.

560
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,440
Maddie left. That makes me cry.

561
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,440
a webcomic.

562
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,600
Um, FYI, I tried one of those ecstasy cigarette things, and I don't feel at all the least

563
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,440
bit, like, aroused. I just have halitosis now.

564
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,440
I'm glad I can't smell it.

565
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,640
Well, let one of us jerk you off, then you'll feel, then you'll feel aroused. No, in fact,

566
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,080
I feel like I gotta take a fat piss. If anything comes out along with it, then I'll let you

567
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,080
guys know.

568
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:08,320
I can smell, you walked in and I can smell that cigarette on you.

569
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,320
For the life of God, and all that is holy!

570
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,200
Brad, smoke five of them, see if anything happens.

571
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,200
Eat them!

572
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,200
You could probably eat them, though, safely.

573
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Yeah, except for the filter.

574
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,200
You could open the filter and make tea out of them.

575
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,200
Seriously, you could.

576
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,200
No, SoCalKicks, I did not just volunteer to do that favor for Brad. He has a girlfriend.

577
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,200
Oh, stop it!

578
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,200
Stop it!

579
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,200
I think now is a good time, because we've got a lot of people tuned in.

580
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,200
They want to hear this. This is the Fremont coverage. This is where all of us were at yesterday.

581
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,200
Let go of it!

582
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,200
Oh my lord.

583
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,600
How does it feel to want?

584
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,320
Alright you can want in one hand and shit in the other and see which one fills up first.

585
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,320
Okay here we go with the Fremont tournament coverage.

586
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,240
This is going to get very crazy you guys, I just warn you.

587
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,240
We'll butt in with our comments.

588
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,160
I'm going to leave the mics hot so we might be butting in and out with our comments.

589
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,160
So here we go.

590
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,160
This is us yesterday.

591
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,160

00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:08,160

619
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,820
You're a Cory fanboy?

620
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,820
Yes, I am.

621
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,820
Did you go, oh my god, it's the Max 300 King?

622

Yes, I said, oh my god, it's the Max 300 King.

623
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:10,820
All right, now anything you want to say to our lovely listeners out there on the radio?

624
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,820
Cory actually really sucks, I just pretend like he's really cool so that he'll like me.

625
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,820
Secrets revealed.

626
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,820
Don't worry, everybody does that. No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

627
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:20,820
Cory's gonna beat me up.

628
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:28,580
I want to say hello to one of my favorite guests to have on any radio program ever.

629
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,180
Give it up, ladies and gentlemen, it's Jahi.

630
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,180
I love this guy.

631
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:34,480
He always puts me on the microphone, especially when I'm drunk.

632
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,480
It's really great.

633
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,480
How are you doing?

634
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,480
How are you doing, Ski?

635
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,480
What have you had to drink today?

636
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,460
I'm actually completely sober and I gave up pot smoking as a New Year's resolution.

637
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,460
What the hell happened?

638
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,460
That's not right.

639
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:47,540
I didn't say I gave up drinking or eating pot, I just said I gave up smoking it.

640
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,260
So having it in the brownies is okay?

641
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,260
Yes.

642
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:56,820

00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:23,580
you been doing here at the thing all day with that bit of leather oh well last

647
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:27,100
year at Fremont one I'd worn a leather vest for routine so this year I'm

648
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:31,060
continuing the tradition I'm referring to the leather that you've been wrapping

649
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:35,880
around all the guys here oh that's the leather whip that's just randomly

650
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,280
wrapping it around people so how many victims have you claimed today well

651
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:49,280
Well, let's see. There's Cory, Nikkari, Nado, um...

652
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,280
I think there were a couple others, but I can't remember right now.

653
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,280
I must have threatened a whole lot of other people with it.

654
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,280
So I'm, are you competing in, you are competing in freestyle today?

Thank you.

658
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,280
Do you have any special words for our listeners?

We are watching Rob get his ass beaten with a whip.

668
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,280
Thank you sir, may I have another?

669
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:01,280
This one violent hyper girl was beating me up with her whip. It was cool.

670
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,280
Ah, I see why all the boys like her.

671
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:09,280
At this point I was sitting inside playing GameCube and I was distracted by that.

672
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,280
All of a sudden I see Aaron...

673
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,280
Did you like the image of me getting beat up?

674
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:22,280
No, I was horribly horribly scarred by it because I look out the window and see Aaron with her whip and see you sticking your ass out waiting for it.

675
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,280
Hey, could have been worse. Could have been my bear ass, okay?

676
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,280
Twitch.

677
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,280
Moving on.

678
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,280
Interviewing you.

679
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,280
Hi guys, I'm DCB.

680
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,280
And what makes you special?

681
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,280
I'm running the tournament, or at least I was.

682
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,280
You're also being pelted with nuts.

683
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,280
It's raining nuts.

684
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,280
Hallelujah.

685
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,280
It's raining nuts.

686
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,280
Stop throwing nuts in my head!

687
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,280
Don't throw nuts in your head!

688
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,280
Hi! So how's the tournament been so far?

689
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,280
It's been hectic.

690
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,280
Because the wrong directions were given out to very many people.

691
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,280
And so that's probably why there's not a lot of people here today.

692
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,280
Stay tuned for the FUs of the Week. We'll be getting into that later.

693
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,280
Yeah, a fuck you goes to MapQuest, indeed.

694
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:13,280
Um, by the way, tournament running is not as much fun as it looks, is it?

695
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,280
I thought it would be fun, but it's hectic. It's crazy.

696
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,280
It's hell. But, you think it's all worth it?

697
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,280
In the end, yeah.

698
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:30,280
So, do you have anything special to say for our listeners?

699
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,280
Hi, guys.

700
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:40,280
Hi, Dad. I'm in jail. I like it here.

701
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:46,280
All right. I have another interview here with the one, the only, the infamous, say hello to Kyle Snyder, ladies and gentlemen.

702
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,280
Hello.

703
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,280
How are you doing today?

704
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,280
I'm doing all right.

705
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,280
What brings you to Fremont, sir?

706
00:48:52,280 --> 00:49:01,280
This is my hometown. I'm competing in this tournament to show my greatest, one of my greatest routines ever.

707
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:06,280
I can't say it's my greatest because flashing tonight is my greatest.

708
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:13,280
What should we expect from your routine today? Is it a big secret? Can you give us any details before you go?

709
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,280
One word.

710
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,280
Shades.

711
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,280
Shades.

712
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,280
Cryptic.

713
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,280
Gets a reaction from the crowd.

714
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,280
Kyle, is there anything you want to say out there, listeners,

715
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,280
Orange Lawns Radio, Bomani Internet Radio?

716
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,280
I sure would.

717
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,280
To all those that are freestyling,

718
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:36,280
you are about to see a routine that you possibly have never seen before.

719
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,280
It is a Michael Jackson routine,

720
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,920
And I guarantee you, you are in for a show.

721
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,840
I am moist with anticipation.

722
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,960
How about everybody else?

723
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,960
Good luck out there, Kyle.

724
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,960
All right.

725
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:51,960
I'll see you soon.

726
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,120
You got many fans out there rooting for you.

727
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,120
Good luck.

728
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,120
All right.

729
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,640
That'd be a pretty cool name.

730
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,640
All right.

731
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,040
We're going to talk to these guys.

732
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,040
You want to talk to these guys, Jamie?

733
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,440
Or you want me to talk to these guys?

734
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,440
All right.

735
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,880
Who is this guy over here in the green?

736
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:06,880
Okay.

737
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,880
My name is Alex, aka La Saca Puntas for this tournament.

738
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,880
And for all you people that don't speak Spanish, that is the pencil sharpener.

739
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,880
Yes, that's right, I said pencil sharpener.

740
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,880
I thought Punta was whore.

741
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,880
No, that's the Saca Puntas.

742
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,880
Oh, my bad.

743
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,880
Yeah, so it's like the whole other word before it.

744
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,880
Yes, I know, I took Spanish.

745
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,880
So you're not a whore sharpener.

746
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,880
No, I'm not a whore shop.

747
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,880
I'm sorry.

748
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,880
Do I do support it?

749
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,880
No.

750
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,880
Anything you want to say about tourney today?

751
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,880
I don't know, actually.

752
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,880
This is my first time, so I don't know.

753
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:34,880
Virgin.

754
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,880
Virgin, yes.

755
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:42,640
Yes, that's right, um, I don't know, I was actually convinced into doing this, so this

756
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:48,300
is my cultural freestyle, best of luck to you, good to meet you, thank you, you too.

757
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,060
And uh, this is the, one of the co-runners of the tournament here, what's your name,

758
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:56,680
sir? Pete, AKA Henry. Alright, and uh, what makes you decide to do a tourney here at the

759
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:03,240
uh, lovely uh, where the hell are we? Funtime Pizza! Uh, I decided to make some money, I

760
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,240
I don't know.

761
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,940
Do you actually make money off a tournament?

762
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,760
That's unheard of for me, but...

763
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,880
Not much, no.

764
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,880
But it's fun.

765
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:10,880
All right.

766
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,360
Anything in particular you're really looking forward to seeing today?

767
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,360
Kyle Snyder.

768
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,360
Kyle Snyder.

769
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,640
It's the reason why we do this, right?

770
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,640
Yes.

771
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,640
Oh, my God.

772
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,640
Must see him.

773
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,640
He's my hero.

774
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,640
Must see.

775
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,640
Must see.

776
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,640
DDR, ladies and gentlemen.

777
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,640
All right.

778
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,680
I had to ask one more question to DCB while I got him.

779
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,080
What's up with the Kirk Cameron and the milk thing?

780
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,000
Chaos, John.

781
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,740
he ripped it out of his cooking textbook

782
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,440
and i don't know if you just said hi guys and stuck it in my face and it's

783
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,760
kind of caught on ever since

784
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,320
wait a minute

785
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:44,280
a cooking textbook does that mean he's in home ec

786
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,960
a guy in home ec

787
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,520
i took a home ec in seventh grade and i got a pleasure because i can cook without burning

788
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,920
things

789
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,700
i took home ec in seventh grade

790
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:58,600
and i fail wait no i didn't see

791
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,400
macaroni is not very hard to make guys bunch of fags

792
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,400
I never took home macaroni, I just took anyway.

793
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,400
You took woodshop, didn't you?

794
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,400
Wait, no, we didn't even make macaroni.

795
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,400
That's too complicated.

796
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,400
I was in the gifted program and I got to take whatever the fuck I wanted.

797
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,400
Wait, no, we didn't make macaroni.

798
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,400
That was too complicated.

799
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:22,400
We made the little, like, biscuits where you, like, open up the can and then you just kind of put them onto the pan.

800
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,400
They made spam.

801
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,400
No, I'm sorry, maybe the school was a little bit too cheap for spam.

802
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,400
You made treat?

803
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:33,800
My home ec class, I actually cooked things.

804
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:38,200
We actually made pancakes from scratch, and I was the only one that could cook them without

805
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,200
burning them.

806
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,600
DCB's telling me that home ec is the cool thing to do at their school.

807
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:48,960
Well, at my school I just liked it because I got to eat food, and they gave this cool

808
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,480
thing to me.

809
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,920
I like to eat food.

810
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,600
I LIKE FOOD!

811
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:01,440
than eating faeces. That's funny, because I took it because I don't like to eat food,

812
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:07,360
you know, I just, oh my god. Okay, EOSFB just summed up high school in one sentence. Fuck,

813
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:11,920
I thought high school was going to be like Saved by the Bell, but I was wrong and disappointed.

814
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,160
Okay, you want to tell me what I learned in high school? Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. I learned

815
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:22,000
how to either annoy or avoid people, and that a mole is 6.02 x 10-23. I'm so excited! I'm

816
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I'm so excited! I'm so excited! I'm so scared!

817
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Never mind.

818
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Back to the back of the tape.

819
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
We'll let DCB finish the story now.

820
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
You can't stop time and talk to the camera?

821
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
You can't stop time and talk to the camera?

822
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
No, unfortunately not.

823
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Aww, back to the story, back to the story.

824
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
That's the joke, if y'all were wondering about inside jokes.

825
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Yeah, it's all over my banner, all over my website, yeah.

826
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,480
It's about to die soon though. We need a new mascot for hi guys. He's so dreamy. Oh hell yeah

827
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:01,760
Right on oh, I didn't ask there's anything else you want to say any other shoutouts you want to give today, or what?

828
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,720
What's up? I?

829
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:07,480
Want to give a shout out to all my azm peeps all around the world

830
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:12,440
Peace out Bo. I was waiting for the acronyms. I've been waiting all day

831
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,400
day

832
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,580

833
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,700

834
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,740
unfortunately not

835
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,400
why not

836
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,120
i'm white

837
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,280
uh... i forgot

838
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,400
that gets me on your head again

839
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,640
i don't have my spinners

855
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,960
you know

856
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,040
that's all right

857
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,360
i don't know how that

858
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,220
I got off the machine and said, I'm not even supposed to be here today. What the hell is going on?

859
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:14,840
GLC Prize. Explain the horsey you've got here. It has a push button.

860
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,140
It's not just your average horse toy.

861
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:22,100
It's a sex toy for both boys and girls, you see.

862
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,420
Because

863
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,920
its beautiful face

864
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,600
gives great head.

865
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,120
And then I see you're caressing that face right now.

866
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,040
Yes, yes. Me and Eve have a lot of fun.

867
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,640
And then, if you flip a-

868
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,200
Eve is in Summer's Eve.

869
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,440
Over.

870
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:41,120
That's the girls' side.

871
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:45,880
This is just like the Harry Potter broomstick that vibrates.

872
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,920
Yeah, those are banned in Australia

873
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:53,020
because 12-year-old girls are riding them for more than an hour.

874
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,080
You must be this tall to ride.

875
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:59,720
Yeah, does that rule apply to, uh, Eve?

876
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:03,160
I can stand up and then give me head.

877
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:06,280
fair enough all right

878
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,260
i think that's better than the parent i think we've got some competition for the

879
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:12,560
fair in europe where jamie go

880
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:15,400
all she's up to no good

881
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,600
i think that's what's going to go cause some havoc

882
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,760
oh my god it's initial d live

883
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,480
it's initial d live

884
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,300
the reason why i don't think that's what he has left about it

885
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:33,620
We're, we're, we're, I've decided that at the next convention, on a big convention I

886
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:36,660
guess I'm gonna cosplay as Ulog.

887
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,660
I'm doing that.

888
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,660
Any fan of me, man.

889
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:39,860
Back to Fremont, hello.

890
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,100
Back to the topic at hand.

891
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:45,360
The reason why I'm yelling initial D live, you had all the step squad walking out towards

892
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,180
the cars, the race track.

893
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:49,340
I didn't know that they were actually going over there to take a group picture.

894
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,380
I thought they were actually all gonna get little go-karts and race.

895
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:52,380
No, we were gonna take a picture.

896
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,380
So I was like, initial D live!

897
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:58,700
I thought you were talking, oh what about like, the one that drove by in the big car

898
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:02,700
with the whole of the muffler. There we go. Oh my god, your cock's so big!

899
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:07,700
God, I hate guys with big cars. Anyway, moving on, interviews.

900
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:14,700
All of Step Squad hates me right now, it's all good. Alright, I'll be back later.

901
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:22,700
Alright, this is the portion of the show where we just give the microphone to Jahi and watch what happens.

902
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,900
Oh God. They keep doing this.

903
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,660
I don't know why. So now I'm walking around and I have a mic.

904
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:35,020
I think he just really doesn't give a rat's ass at this point. He's just, he's just letting me go.

905
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:40,780
He's just letting me go. I'm like the, like, man on the street host. I don't know.

906
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:44,700
Alright, so right now I'm walking around the front of, uh, Game Zone

907
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:51,500
Fremont. This is my old stomping grounds right here. Good shot to my friend, uh, Walter Williams. We used to walk here all the time. It's a nice arcade. And we're here with, um,

908
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,500
Natto. Natto, how's it going, man?

909
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,500
Yeah, pretty good, man. How's it going?

910
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,500
Cool, cool. Yeah, so you're here with Final Hyper, girl?

911
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,500
Yes, yes I am, yeah.

912
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,500
I'm assuming you're, like, happy today because she hasn't whipped you.

913
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:06,500
Well, yeah, oh, yeah. Like, I'm very fortunate that she hasn't whipped me yet, but she's, like, kicking the crap out of me right now.

914
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:12,500
VHD being the SSA or she is, she's kicking the shit out of Natto right now. They're probably going to have to edit that out on the show.

915
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:20,500
I got tons of people out here. Um, Khan's here, DCB's over here with his Kirk Cameron photo, which has traumatized me a lot.

916
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:30,280
oh god it's the man the myth the legend the RTF representer no skizzle Mike no

00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:13,900
All right, we're going to get run over, so I'm going to move. Fuzzy's drunk ass is driving

924
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,860
to hell with AORI, so I'm about to interview them in a minute.

925
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:19,940
How are you two gentlemen today? Are you competing in the tournament today?

926
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:20,940
Yes, I am.

927
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:21,940
Great, great. What's your name?

928
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:22,940
Robby.

929
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:25,100
Pete, I'm the one that's running the tournament.

930
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:29,540
Okay, so Pete's one of the staffers here that I haven't met yet, and he has, what does that

931
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:33,980

932
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:36,500

933
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:39,420
I'm gonna be playing long train of run in my freshman's freestyle.

934
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:44,580
Wow. Okay, so we actually have somebody here with guitar skills, so we're not gonna hear Stairway to Heaven, right?

935
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:45,500
Uh, correct.

936
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:49,780
Thank you. Thank you, God. So how's the tournament been running today?

937
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:54,220
It's good. Yeah, at first, no, it was not good. There's like five people showed up, but then, yeah, everyone showed up.

938
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:56,420
Cool. So how many people do you think you have here today?

939
00:59:56,420 --> 01:00:00,140
Uh, maybe like 80.

940
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,780
Wow. No, no. I don't know.

941
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:03,300
We'll find out later if that's...

942
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,340
How many tournaments have you run? This is my first one.

943
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:11,340
Is this the, from the tournaments that you've been to in DDR, is this like the average turnout for a tournament about 80, 100 people?

944
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,340
Yes it is.

945
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:13,340
Good turnout for the most part?

946
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:14,340
Yeah.

947
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:15,340
Everybody makes their money back and...

948
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:17,340
Yeah, everything's good.

949
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:22,340
Okay, he looks like he's scared as hell because I have a microphone right here. Don't worry, it's Orange Lounge. Everybody's half drunk anyway.

950
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:26,340
Orange Lounge owns you, go to that website. Okay, we got another person over here. This is...

951
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:29,340
I so can't read that, that's Chaos. Okay, how's it going, man?

952
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:30,340
What's up, man?

953
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,340
How you doing today?

954
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:32,340
I'm pretty good.

955
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,340
Did you already compete today?

956
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,340
Yep, I got third place in PA.

957
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:39,940
Wow third place in PA and he's getting he beat me at PA sniff. That's okay. I wasn't even supposed to be there

958
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,940
Anyway, you beat me

959
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:48,740
Miracles happen, I don't know. I just I just remember everyone that sounds like oh, yeah

960
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:52,500
it's gonna be this this and this and as always the top three they always mean but I

961
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:57,920
Don't know it's just I I woke up on the right side of bed, I guess

962
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,920
but I was able to go due to some reasons.

963
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,760
really because of emphasis and of course Tigger

964
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,120
I still fear emphasis and Tigger I'm like you know like a newbie when it

965
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,520
comes to the whole PA thing

966
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:10,480
so Cory's stealing his money so but yeah but

967
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,000
so how did you feel about third place what song did you play as your last song when you competed?

968
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,640
we played... what did we play? we played Kakamei

969
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:23,760
Heavy. Oh but the listeners after this tournament did take place on a DDR7 mix

970
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,760
so Kakamei is just nasty anyway

971
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:26,760
I did not.

972
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:27,760
Why not have a cock?

973
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:28,760
We got nuts.

974
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,760
We got balls.

975
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:30,760
We got cock.

976
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:31,760
It's a regular gay porno out here.

977
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,760
I think I see Ken Stryker walking in right now.

978
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:33,760
And Hanzo just ran out when he heard about the nuts.

979
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:34,760
FYI, it's Jeff Stryker.

980
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:35,760
Not that I know these things.

981
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:36,760
Balls and cock.

982
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:37,760
How you doing, Hanzo?

983
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:38,760
Oh, hey now.

984
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,760
Hey now.

985
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,760
I don't be getting down like that.

986
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,760
I'm going to leave that up for you.

987
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,760
But, hey.

988
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:43,760
Hey.

989
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,760
Hey.

990
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:45,760
Hey.

991
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:46,760
Hey.

992
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:47,760
Hey.

993
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,760
Hey.

994
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:49,760
Hey.

995
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,760
Hey.

996
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,760
Hey.

997
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,760
Hey.

998
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:53,760
Hey.

999
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,760
Hey.

1000
01:02:54,760 --> 01:03:01,420
for you, but hey, I'm not down with the whole nuts and cocks thing. I don't swag. I'd rather

1001
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:05,600
be down with that than be down with what R. Kelly was down with, though. You're right,

1002
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:11,720
that is all bad. That whole yellow shower thing? No, no. Anybody here like the yellow

1003
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:17,560
shower thing? No. Exactly. Scott wanted to play a song. We're going to let Scott play

No, I'm not. I'm from San Francisco.

1039
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,160
Cool. Wow, you had a long trip coming out here. We're in Fremont, California today.

1040
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,160
I know we are.

1041
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,160
That's exactly right. Good job.

1042
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,160
Where part of San Francisco are you from?

1043
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:54,160
I don't live there. I was from there. I was born and conceived there.

1044
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,160
Okay, where do you live now?

1045
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,160
I live in Newark.

1046
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,160
Okay, so he's right down the street practically here.

1047
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,160
Yeah, I'm right down the street. That's cool.

1048
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,160
This is like mild stomping grounds. Do you like it here?

1049
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:07,160
Oh, yeah. This is very gravy, I believe is the terminology.

1050
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:10,160
You like being able to walk home at night and not get stabbed and stuff?

1051
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,160
Oh yes I do, yes I do.

1052
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,160
Or not get held at gunpoint for my gay porn.

1053
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,160
I mean, wait.

1054
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,160
Axe is a busy, busy man.

1055
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,160
So did you compete today or are you waiting to compete?

1056
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,160
I'm waiting to compete. I'm going to be doing my cultural freestyle to La Señorita.

1057
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:26,160
I couldn't believe I said that as well as I possibly could.

1058
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,160
Now just so I don't have a bunch of people who are pissed off, shoot me later.

1059
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,160
Are you part Mexican or Latino?

1060
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,160
Yes I am, I'm half.

1061
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,160
I celebrate single-to-mouth till noon, then I'm done.

1062
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:39,600
Alright, so remember, this is Oxus Freestyle.

1063
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:43,120
If you are mad at the cultural freestyle, if you see it on the internet, do not shoot

1064
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,120
me.

1065
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,560
I did not endorse this.

1066
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:48,280
I think Dark Stalker wants the mic back because it's like a cock.

1067
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,280
I don't know.

1068
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,280
Oh, baby.

1069
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,280
No.

1070
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,280
It's, I believe, time for Freshness Freestyle.

1071
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,280
Yay!

1072
01:05:54,280 --> 01:06:01,080
Time for Freshness Freestyle, where everybody can do knee drops and hand slaps.

1073
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,080
Newbie Freshness.

1074
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,080
Oh, yeah!

1075
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:31,920
My big apologies to Chubbs and Maple because I told them we would interview them after

1076

01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,160
No, no, no.

1083
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,160
Okay, I can re-style.

1084
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,160
It's all about the nut-chop.

1085
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,960
Wait, wait, wait.

1086
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:32,960
Am I white?

1087
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:33,960
Wait, what am I wearing?

1088
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:34,960
What am I wearing?

1089
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:35,960
The FUBU.

1090
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:36,960
Yes, the FUBU.

1091
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:37,960
I'm not white.

1092
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:38,960
Now, wait a minute.

1093
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:39,960
A white girl tied for the winner yesterday at the competition.

1094
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:40,960
No.

1095
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,320
Yeah, we have our first place winner.

1096
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,200
The first place team was half white.

1097
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,200
Yep.

1098
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,200
Oh, yeah.

1099
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,200
Oh, yeah.

1100
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,200
All right.

1101
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,200
Yeah, it was half white.

1102
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,200
That's why.

1103
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,840
Because first place, it was actually one of the best routines I've seen in a very, very

1104
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:55,840
long time.

1105
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,840
Well choreographed.

1106
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,840
It was a good routine.

1107
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,840
It was a good routine, yes.

1108
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:05,840
But like 99% of the time, white guys don't freestyle at all.

1109
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,840
Well...

1110
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,840
Oh, I mean...

1111
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,840
Give us some credit. Dave over here can do the grapevine.

1112
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,840
What are you talking about, Dave?

1113
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,840
White guys don't freestyle.

1114
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,840
Look at Kyle Snyder!

1115
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:22,840
Can we go to break now, please? We'll come back and we'll finish talking about freestyle.

1116
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:27,840
So send me your refuse. If you don't want to come in the chat room and do it, you can send us an email.

1117
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:28,840
Jamie, give us that address.

1118
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:35,840
Um, words. No. It's orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com.

1119
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:38,840
Alrighty, so we'll be right back.

1120
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:42,840
Sorry? Oh, bitches. I thought you said and then.

1121
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:43,840
And then?

1122
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:44,840
And then? No, and then.

1123
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:49,840
We'll be right back after some more happy fun MP3s from Xtreme.

1124
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:22,600
I can't wait to see you in the next video!

1125
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:32,600
I'll see you in the next video!

1126
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:42,600
I'll see you in the next video!

1127
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:37,560
Give it to me good Give it to me good

1128
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:55,560
Are you ready?

1129
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,560
Yes, it's love we share

1130
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,560
You are a super dancer!

1131
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:33,560
Yes, we only stay together

1132
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:38,560
Lashing hands, dancing and turning

1133
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,560
Turn away

1134
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,560
What a great feeling!

1135
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,560
Awaken more than only letting you go

1136
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:51,560
I, I have to let you go

1137
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:54,560
I just want you to know

1138
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,560
Can you hear the cheering?

1139
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:00,560
The one, the one I love

1140
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,560
Super performance

1141
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:17,560
I, I have to let you go

1142
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,560
May you remember me

1143
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:24,560
Let me forget you

1144
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:30,560
The one I love, is, I only have to let you go

1145
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,560
I just want you to know

1146
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:38,560
You'll always be the one I love

1147
01:13:54,560 --> 01:14:00,560
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1148
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:10,200
I want to see Captain Jack cry.

1149
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,200
We're back.

1150
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:14,600
Mommy, sing me a fast trip machine.

1151
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:20,080
My phone's going off.

1152
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:25,420
In that set we heard Love on a Trip Machine and Memories.

1153
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:26,800
It's a polytary song!

1154
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:27,800
What the hell happened?

1155
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:31,800
It is a Polteri song, however, it's a good Polteri song where she can hold a key.

1156
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:35,800
That's right, you'll all come around eventually.

1157
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,800
I've been listening to Polteri since way back.

1158
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,440
Yeah, but she's not holding up on her head between her ears, okay?

1159
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:41,440
Like that friggin' bunny.

1160
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,240
Is she balancing pancakes on her head?

1161
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,240
She should be.

1162
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,640
Okay, yeah.

1163
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,460
So what's up next, Rob?

1164
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:53,800
I wanted to talk about Freestyle, because we've got Xplizit.

1165
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:54,800
Let's talk to Xplizit.

1166
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,360
He's somebody who we haven't had on the show before.

1167
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:01,480
the mic, how you doing? Alright, I'm doing alright. You missed Fremont yesterday, what

1168
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:06,640
gives? I have some family stuff to take care of. Ah, family crap, I know how that goes.

1169
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:13,360
So, what do you think about freestyle today in the DDR world? How's it going there? I'm

1170
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:18,480
working on it very well. I'm trying to get better and better and better as well. As y'all

1171
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:24,620
know, I used to be explicit alpha like last year and everything. I'm on the beta stage.

1172
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,860
We gamma coming soon?

1173
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:29,740
As the beta dies off.

1174
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:33,220
I want it to die off after MGL.

1175
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:36,660
And later on we can call you Explicit Pie.

1176
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:38,460
Oh my gosh.

1177
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:40,420
And speaking of freestyle, I got

1178
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:42,300
routines already planned.

1179
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,980
You like an extreme?

1180
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:45,060
So far so good.

1181
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:47,540
Very freestyle-able stuff in there?

1182
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:49,460
Yeah, there's like a lot of good songs in there.

1183
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:52,220
A lot of variations.

1184
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:54,220
That song was like, We Will Rock You.

1185
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:56,220
That was like one of the most off-picks.

1186
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:57,220
The Ballbox!

1187
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:59,220
Oh my gosh!

1188
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:02,220
I'm wondering what that Ricky Martin song was, I was like, oh my gosh.

1189
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:05,220
I'm waiting to see someone do a routine to Bag.

1190
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:07,220
I'm waiting.

1191
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:12,220
You know, I would even be half tempted to take the Cup of Life and bring out my Samba de Amigo maracas.

1192
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:16,220
I'll do Bag, I'll wear the kilt, commando style.

1193
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:19,220
Come on everybody, you know you want it.

1194
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:24,220
Then I can get the, you know, cock-whipped-out thing, you know, done.

1195
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:26,220
Dot, dot, dot.

1196
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:27,220
Anyway.

1197
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:30,220
Yeah, why is it that nobody whips their cock out at the end of a routine?

1198
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:31,220
That's what I really want to know.

1199
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:33,220
Why have these freestylers done that?

1200
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:40,220
Just at the end, go, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, yeah, there it is.

1201
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:42,220
Why hasn't anyone done that explicit?

1202
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:43,220
It happens.

1203
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:48,220
Well, they've got planned routines, they do whatever they want.

1204
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:52,220
I can say something very mean right now, but I'm not going to do it.

1205
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:53,220
Say it!

1206
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:54,220
No!

1207
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:55,220
I can't, I'm going to get killed.

1208
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:56,220
Fine.

1209
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:58,220
Save it for next show.

1210
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:00,900
Oh, okay.

1211
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:03,220
What's the next big tour you plan on competing in, locally, here?

1212
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:08,220
Well, probably the one in Sacramento that's coming out in March, because I've heard all

1213
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:09,220
about it.

1214
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:10,220
Right.

1215
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,220
And B3, which is in April.

1216
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:13,220
Ah, it's going to be big.

1217
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:16,900
Actually, from what I understand, it might be postponed until May, but the details are

1218
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:23,780
Actually, I'm pretty sure that the confirmed dates are going to be the second weekend in

1219
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:29,700
May, which should be the 11th and 12th. But I'm pretty sure that's the confirmed date

1220
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:36,120
now that the planned... In case people are wondering, planned events should be a Beat

1221
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:46,120
Menias score competition, both freestyle and PA for DDR, and a Dance Maniacs tournament

1222
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,120
too.

1223
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,280
Wow, Dance Maniacs, interesting.

1224
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,680
I might actually compete in a Dance Maniacs tournament.

1225
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:54,320
Dance Maniacs, actually, I can kind of dance to.

1226
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:57,780
It's kind of, it's a shock, but anyway, I'm sorry.

1227
01:17:57,780 --> 01:18:00,120
So you'll be doing the B3 tournament too as well, huh?

1228
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,120
Indeed.

1229
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,120
Shaking your ass don't count.

1230
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,120
Whatever, whatever.

1231
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:10,960
Any friends listening, you might want to say hello to, anything you want to say, you're

1232
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:11,960
waiting for it.

1233
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:12,960
Well, the shout-outs to the visionaries.

1234
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:18,520
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the Fremont tournament, but I heard about the Fremont

1235
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,520
tournament and I struck winds.

1236
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:21,520
Good shit.

1237
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,520
But again, I wasn't able to.

1238
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:26,360
It's the first tourney that I've actually, well, I did one, I judged one small tourney

1239
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:30,360
at Sac State last year, but this is the first major tourney that I've gotten to judge.

1240
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:31,360
It was interesting.

1241
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,760
I like judging because they get a front row seat.

1242
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,760
Indeed.

1243
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,680
I got a front row seat too.

1244
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:38,680
You were sitting on the ground in front of me.

1245
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:43,880
Well, yeah, I had a front row seat that was closer than Rob except my ass got sore and

1246
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:44,880
I...

1247
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:45,880
Whoa!

1248
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:46,880
Whoa!

1249
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,400
Not that way!

1250
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:53,240
My feet fell asleep and I was in a really bad spot when I had to go get up and take

1251
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:57,000
a piss four times because I drank too much soda during the day.

1252
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:02,140
I had a second row spot and what was awesome is when I couldn't see anything behind certain

1253
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:05,780
people, I was sitting right next to the camera, so just watch the viewfinder, perfect shot

1254
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:07,400
of the whole thing.

1255
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:11,820
I had a backstage pass, all of the stuff Scott was hanging out outside, so we were just sort

1256
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:14,940
of watching from the back of the machine going, whoa.

1257
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:17,740
And there was of course the running commentary by a few people back there, you know that

1258
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:22,460
person has a good technique, but you know, they're random.

1259
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:23,460
What do you think about that?

1260
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:25,820
We were kind of talking a little bit about this during breaks, kind of a con...oh yes,

1261
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:32,820
Okay. All I gotta say is, Kakumei! Kakumei! Kakumei! Oh my gosh. Let the joke die, step

1262
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:43,760
away from the joke. Hey, I just heard cock and I was like, oh, where? How large? One

1263
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:49,200
thing I want to ask you, as a freestyler, because nobody else in this room can dance,

1264
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:54,640
but as a freestyler, just kidding, all in good fun, as a freestyler, what do you think

1265
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:57,920
about, this is kind of controversial, what do you think about the typical way to judge

1266
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:01,480
attorney where you have the points, you grade everybody on a scale of 100 as opposed to

1267
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:05,160
this new, semi-new tower system they've got going, what do you think about that?

1268
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:10,200
Well, they're both good in certain ways, but sometimes some people get too offended with

1269
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:15,160
the scores, like if they get lower than 70 they think they've done very bad, but if they

1270
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:19,080
get like over 80 they think okay, and if they get 90 they do pretty good.

1271
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:22,820
Which as far as I know, you know, the way, if I remember the way grades work, you have

1272
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:32,500
You have to get 50 or below to get an F. If you get 70 and 80, that's the C. That's average.

1273
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:33,500
Maybe I'm just a tough judge.

1274
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,500
That's how I'd grade them.

1275
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:35,980
Between 70 and 80 would be average.

1276
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:38,940
But with the tower, somebody's got to be on the bottom.

1277
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:40,300
Somebody's going to be on the bottom, right?

1278
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:41,300
That kind of sucks, too.

1279
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:45,460
Yeah, but the only thing about the tower system is it prevents people from getting biased

1280
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:50,260
because some people might complain if they don't get into qualifying the actual brackets.

1281
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:57,340
Well, I also got to think too that with the tower system there's usually in most cases there are people that deserve the bottom spot

1282
01:20:57,660 --> 01:21:04,180
Well, I mean there are a few cases where like there are tournaments where there's all good freestyles like CVGL 1

1283
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:10,480
But there are some a lot of tournaments where some people just don't deserve anything higher than the bottom spot

1284
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:16,600
Well as far as the tower system goes when I went to MGL the way the grid was kind of unique

1285
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:19,380
But it kind of took a long time because there's like a lot of people participating

1286
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:26,380
participating. When I saw the scores, the top 8 will only be in the list. So far 15

1287
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:32,100
people placed, especially me when I was an NGO. Like Bruce LeRoy, he got perfect eights

1288
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:35,180
on his section. Of course his routine was very good.

1289
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:37,980
You know the way they did it, they changed a little bit for this one yesterday. They

1290
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:42,660
did do complete towers. We had to do the whole damn thing, everybody. And the person who

1291
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:48,100
I put at the bottom, the person I put at the very bottom, I wouldn't say that it was necessarily

1292
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:54,000
bad. It was fun and it's the kind of thing where I think if I'd seen it Friday night

1293
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:59,200
at the arcade it would have been cool, but at the tournament level it wasn't well prepared

1294
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,440
and polished. I think things when they're in a tournament need to be polished and it's

1295
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:06,360
all about show and presentation. This was just kind of looked more like, I'm just having

1296
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:10,880
fun. It would have been cool for a Friday night at the arcade routine, but as a tournament

1297
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:14,440
it didn't strike me as anything special.

1298
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:17,840
As far as the tournament goes, if a routine looks like something that people could do

1299
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,520
it on Friday night, it wouldn't be okay.

1300
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,280
But if it looks like a routine that people have to put their heart on, like practice,

1301
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,280
practice, practice.

1302
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:25,280
Huh?

1303
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:26,280
Did you say hard on?

1304
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,280
No!

1305
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,280
Heart!

1306
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,280
Not hard on!

1307
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,280
Who could look it down my pants?

1308
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,280
Ow!

1309
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:35,120
Well, you're doing well with this group.

1310
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:38,760
Okay, I've got the jump to conclusions mat.

1311
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:44,940
Well, my whole thing about the tower, I think that it still opens up the door for bias even

1312
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:49,980
though you've got multiple people, which is why I don't know if anyone remembers the one

1313
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:56,320
that I did at Shaft by having you judge on parts of the percentage.

1314
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:02,960
And that way the final result is based on each individual piece rather

1315
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,780
than just giving them a flat score.

1316
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:08,000
I think that that sort of closes the door on bias too.

1317
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,240
And it still actually allows room for bias because one of the sections was,

1318
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:14,220
what is your opinion of this, of this match?

1319
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:17,160
What is you as someone just watching it, what do you think?

1320
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:21,300
Because that also has something to do with it because you've got to think that the crowd that's watching,

1321
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,040
they're also thinking the same thing.

1322
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:27,300
They're not necessarily watching, oh, how well their feet move or how polished are they.

1323
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:29,480
They're saying, oh, I like this or I don't like this.

1324
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:33,440
True. I think that to some point bias should play a part in it.

1325
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,320
But because you have multiple judges, you have more room to work with.

1326
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:42,320
If people don't get biased, then people will not improve on their routines.

1327
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:45,320
I've seen people who say, oh, they've got low scores.

1328
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:48,320
They actually look at their stats to see what they need to work on.

1329
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:51,320
Hell, I even do that, like what mistakes I've made.

1330
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:54,320
Like what mistakes I've made and everything.

1331
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,320
Or what other people make mistakes.

1332
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:00,320
At the end of the day, try to think of the negatives and not do it.

1333
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:04,320
Look at the positives and work on that even more and make it a better routine.

1334
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:07,960
That's what I try to do as well as the judges, write something negative and something positive

1335
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:08,960
about everybody.

1336
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,400
I put something negative about the people I put in first place or person, then I put

1337
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,400
something positive about the person I put in last place.

1338
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,720
Just because, you know, everybody wants to hear something good and bad.

1339
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:17,720
Yeah, true.

1340
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:21,040
But sometimes some people get very offended with it, so they want advice.

1341
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:26,600
Like, try to do something original, you could say that, if the routine is not original.

1342
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:29,680
Or try to be more smooth, you could say, or something like that.

1343
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:32,200
It's like, guys, the ketchup dance is not that original.

1344
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,200
Stick to P.A.

1345
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:09,560
I advise them, try to make your moves smooth, try not to fumble on a few moves, try to make

1346
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:14,760
your routine a little bit creative, lose enough, have some fun, don't take it too seriously.

1347
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:19,440
I've seen people make mistakes, like trying to memorize the steps and everything, and

1348
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:23,400
it ends up making them so nervous that they're getting everything.

1349
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:28,000
That's always when I judge, the biggest thing that I look for is I look for their expression.

1350
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,420
I don't care if they miss one of their moves.

1351
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:33,920
I don't know what they had planned.

1352
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:39,200
I haven't been sitting there looking at their choreographed piece of paperwork or at the

1353
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,200
screen.

1354
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:43,320
I'll look, I'll glance at the screen occasionally to see if maybe they're hitting the steps

1355
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:49,280
okay because that shows preparation, but the first thing I look for is to see how they're

1356
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:54,160
smoothing over their mistakes, how they are portraying themselves, and if they're playing

1357
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,160
to the crowd.

1358
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:59,200
If they're sitting there with this high energy routine and they're just there going ooh on

1359
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:02,120
on their face, I'm not gonna enjoy it.

1360
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:03,840
True, they must have like a smile on their face

1361
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,260
to show that they're actually having fun.

1362
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:07,100
Exactly.

1363
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:08,960
Like that face.

1364
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,480
As much as I hate to use her as an example,

1365
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:14,280
one person who I think actually does display this,

1366
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:18,480
what I'm talking about is actually Fiona, Dr. Hikaru.

1367
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,040
When she freestyles, she smiles.

1368
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:22,640
She plays to the crowd.

1369
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:27,640
Maybe, you know, I'm talking about actually as a performer,

1370
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:32,600
She actually does have good performance skills because you never, at least any time I've

1371
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:36,860
ever seen her do anything, she never looks like she's concentrating too hard.

1372
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:42,760
She looks like she's performing, putting forth the best show, putting forth the best face

1373
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:44,320
for the audience.

1374
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,920
And that's what freestyle should be, I think.

1375
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:46,920
Yeah, yeah.

1376
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:50,840
Almost like most of the people who are raking the tops, that's where they belong.

1377
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:55,920
Think of people like Hypnotics, Bruce Leroy, or AJ.

1378
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:00,880
Those are people I've never seen sit and frown while they're doing a high energy performance.

1379
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:04,400
They're awesome.

1380
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:07,360
It's just your expression.

1381
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,760
I think that 50% of a performance is your expression.

1382
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,760
The rest of it is the work.

1383
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,120
True, true.

1384
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:17,520
So you're saying if I smile the whole time and just play, then I'll get like 50?

1385
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,520
No, I'm not saying that.

1386
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,100
No no no no!

1387
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:25,640
Yeah, you get 50 and the rest of it will suck.

1388
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:28,920
Then I'll throw in a knee drop and you get a 95!

1389
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:34,740
Well, 50 would be better than what I got last time!

1390
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:38,360
Reserve the Knee Drops, Hand Plugs, Matrix Walks, and Bar Raping!

1391
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:43,360
But you had everybody going, ooh, right when you started, you know.

1392
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,220
Anyway, uhh.

1393
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:48,000
Hey, what's the deal?

1394
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Hey, what's the deal? I mean, I know these songs are played out, but maybe somebody can do something original with it.

1395
01:27:53,000 --> 01:28:01,000
I mean, hey, they don't know you. They don't know how you would have just busted out some crazy shit or something.

1396
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Come on, comment, somebody! Please, help me! I'm drowning!

1397
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:09,000
I don't know, I kind of want to see someone like Kid Zero do a routine to Dynamite Ray or something,

1398
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:14,000
because he could actually make one look really, really good if he wanted to. I mean, he's crazy.

1399
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Well, the only problem with the steps, the only thing I don't like about the song is the steps, the actual basic steps. There's so many jumps.

1400
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Well, the thing about this is that even steps, you know, that could even though open up the door for trying to innovate on how to do a jump, you know.

1401
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:38,000
There's different ways to do things, you know. I wanted to do, I wanted actually, I had one worked out a long time ago and all I had was second mix.

1402
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I had a routine worked out to W W involving pom poms, doing a cheerleading dance.

1403
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Cool.

1404
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I'm not sure if that's seen by SVGL or not.

1405
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
And you know what, though? It would work because of the jumps.

1406
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Because I was a lot more flexible in those days.

1407
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:59,000
And you know what, CaptainJackBasic? You can riverdance on that.

1408
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Yeah, I've heard about that.

1409
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Who knows? People could start freestyling to Max 300 and Max Unlimited.

1410
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
It could happen.

1411
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I did that before.

1412
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
How does that work?

1413
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Well...

1414
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Lotta poppin' lockin' and um...

1415
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Um...

1416
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
A lot of vid to get.

1417
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
So what do you actually...

1418
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Yes, exactly.

1419
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,000
What do you notice is the current trends in freestyle? What type of styles are people aiming more toward?

1420
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Well...

1421
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Not including new-buy styles. Sorry if I'm offending anybody who does those hand-plants, knee-drops, etc. etc. etc.

1422
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Well, true.

1423
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
It's all I can do, man!

1424
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Hahahaha!

1425
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:42,000
But people like aiming some stuff they see from music videos or whatever, sometimes they're trying to make up their own.

1426
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Some people have their own signature moves. Almost everybody has their own signature moves.

1427
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:57,000
I actually don't see a problem with an occasional hand plant or an occasional knee drop as long as it doesn't make their whole routine and actually maybe a transition to another move.

1428
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Yeah, like, if you want to do something like, if you see After the Game of Love by Tranpower

1429
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:11,000
and Shaft, he did like a knee-drop, but he did like a very special version of it, like a slap-drop.

1430
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Like a, what would I say, romantic or exotic somewhat.

1431
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
He laid a smackdown onto the pad.

1432
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,000
He showed some love to that down arrow.

1433
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Oh no, impregnation right there.

1434
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,640
Let it down.

1435
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:31,440
Or people do hand slaps on the ground just to play around.

1436
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:35,400
Yeah, as long as you're just not like, oh, I'm standing.

1437
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:36,720
Oh, my knee's on the right arrow.

1438
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:37,720
Oh, I'm standing again.

1439
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,240
That, you know, no.

1440
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:43,200
But I think that I don't think that people should just

1441
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:46,720
automatically discount a type of move because it's old

1442
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:47,920
or lots of people have done it.

1443
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:49,320
You just have to innovate on it.

1444
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:49,960
Yeah, true.

1445
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:52,120
You don't want to repeat the same hand, plant, knee drop

1446
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:53,800
move over and over and over unless you're

1447
01:30:53,800 --> 01:31:07,960
something like 18. Yeah. DZP, no preliciting to this. He is, he says hi. DZP, I remember

1448
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:12,720
I was supposed to promise you that I was going to bring some balls, like 20 packs, but. We

1449
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:19,920
saw plenty of balls yesterday. Including bouncing ones that were multicolored. But again I hope

1450
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,480
to come to the one in Sacramento for P3. I'm going to see you there.

1451
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:27,680
I'm just wondering, because I was out of the room for a little bit, did we do FUs already?

1452
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:31,840
No, we need to do our FUs of the Week. Want to do a break and then do them, or want to

1453
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,840
do them now? Let's do them now, and then we'll take a break.

1454
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:38,040
Alright, we'll do them now. Here we go. Starting off, boys and girls.

1455
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:42,600
Bad Bulls out the list. Oh my God. Alright, we got a big, big FUs

1456
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:46,560
of the Week segment, so here it goes, ladies and gentlemen. We have a lot of new listeners

1457
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:50,840
to the show tonight, Jamie, I know I have you do this a lot, but I think it's important.

1458
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:53,520
Let's remind the listeners what the FUs of the Week are all about.

1459
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:58,880
Our FUs of the Week is where we take everything that we think sucks and go, fuck you!

1460
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,840
Fuck you right in your ass!

1461
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:03,240
And do they have to be about DDR or any of that stuff?

1462
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:04,240
No.

1463
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:05,240
They can be whatever the hell you want.

1464
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:06,240
Exactly.

1465
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:11,600
This is when you give them a fuck, you shove so far up their ass, they're tasting the chalk.

1466
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,600
That being said, Jamie.

1467
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,600
I want to terror mix today.

1468
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:20,600
My F.U. goes out to Jamie for being a picky bitch.

1469
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:27,600
I wanted to start off with the best line from video game music ever.

1470
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:30,600
This is fucked up? Hold on, let me see if I can find it.

1471
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:32,600
There it is. Slag work terror.

1472
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:34,600
Here we go.

1473
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:59,600
My Fuck You of the Week, first and foremost, goes toward MapQuest. Except I was asleep for most of the trip, but I had to pee. MapQuest got us lost, but I'll let Rob be the one that's gonna go that way.

1474
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:08,600
My other fuck you goes to the bump in the parking lot at Funtime Pizza, because I had to pee then too.

1475
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:12,600
And the bump was big, and it made me have to pee more.

1476
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:16,600
My other fuck you goes towards...

1477
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:23,600
There's one I've been debating about mentioning, because I really just think it's more hilarious than anything.

1478
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:30,600
To the little fucker who's been spamming my LiveJournal, I know who you are, and I think it's damn funny that you're still bringing this up.

1479
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,600
My god, people just can't let stuff drop.

1480
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,600
Anyway, that was pretty...

1481
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,600
It was pretty hilarious, I had a laugh.

1482
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:38,600
Shine lose.

1483
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:39,600
Shine lose.

1484
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:49,600
Um, my other fuck you goes toward my cold, um, which actually had me comatose on Wednesday thanks to my quill, capital N, small i, big fucking Q.

1485
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,600
Green death, orange death.

1486
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,600
Green death.

1487
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:57,600
You know, my teeth are green. Merry Christmas.

1488
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:01,600
But it's settled in my lungs, and I've had nasty ass cough.

1489
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:07,600
And I was going to do PA yesterday, but because of my cough, I haven't really been able to play much DDR.

1490
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:11,600
It's been hard to walk up the stairs without my asthma acting up.

1491
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,600
Because of my breathing.

1492
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:17,600
Oh my god, you've got a dog between your legs!

1493
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:26,600
You are not supposed to have a dog there, you are supposed to have a pussy there.

1494
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:28,600
Angels giving you Propel to make it better.

1495
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:31,600
Thank you. Oh, I like Peach Propel though.

1496
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:38,600
Oh yeah, fuck you to the Walgreens in town for not having Peach Propel yet.

1497
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:48,140
oh yeah I buried my old shoes finally the shoes that I fucked off last week

1498
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:54,820
and I have new shoes and my shoes are black and gray and yellow my shoes are

1499
01:34:54,820 --> 01:35:00,980
fresh and fuck my shoelaces that I couldn't find because they're purple and

1500
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:05,980
I found my rainbowy ones, they were too bright.

1501
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:09,980
Um, and um, um, yeah.

1502
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:15,980
Oh, and um, um, fuck not being able to think of anything else.

1503
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:18,980
Oh yes, more fucks!

1504
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:22,980
Fuck the situation that I heard about today.

1505
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:28,980
My fiancé, Suzanne, who I love lately, ran into somebody's door.

1506
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:31,980
It wasn't his fault, it wasn't their person's fault.

1507
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:36,980
He was just turning into a parking space, um, in a private property and everything,

1508
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:41,980
and showing you the parking place, and this person with their brand new car that only had 96 miles on it,

1509
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:44,980
a Chrysler, ran into their open door.

1510
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:47,980
So the door's fucked up, our front bumper is fucked up.

1511
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:48,980
This is fucked up.

1512
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:50,980
And this is indeed fucked up.

1513
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:58,980
And so now it's going to be on our insurance and their insurance, but I don't think anyone's going to really have a fault for that car thing.

1514
01:35:58,980 --> 01:36:00,980
But I think we're going to be getting a new car, which is cool.

1515
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:02,980
I want a car.

1516
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:08,980
And fuck every single 86 Corolla hatchback in town for not being mine.

1517
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:10,980
And that's it.

1518
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:13,980
Actually, I'm going to go next, because Loki's list is too big.

1519
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:14,980
So...

1520
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:16,980
Fuck Loki's list!

1521
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:18,980
My list isn't that big.

1522
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:24,980
My FU of the week, we'll do FU, we'll go around the room to everybody, yeah.

1523
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:27,980
Okay, yeah, we go first because it's our show.

1524
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:32,980
Possessive us? No.

1525
01:36:32,980 --> 01:36:38,980
The first FU I'd like to give us to MapQuest, you suck. Die.

1526
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:44,980
Funtime Happy Pizza Place, or whatever the fuck it was called, is not off of mission.

1527
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:47,980
It's completely on the other side of the galaxy.

1528
01:36:47,980 --> 01:36:49,980
Why the hell were you telling me it was there?

1529
01:36:49,980 --> 01:36:54,980
Die, die along with your firstborn and your ex-wife.

1530
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:56,980
I hate you.

1531
01:36:56,980 --> 01:37:01,980
My next F.U. goes out to MTV and music videos in general.

1532
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:03,980
They were so much cooler in the 80's.

1533
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:05,980
VH1 classic forever.

1534
01:37:05,980 --> 01:37:07,980
I thought yes, that one animated head.

1535
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:09,980
VH1 classic forever.

1536
01:37:09,980 --> 01:37:12,980
With the drugs flying out of the neck.

1537
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:14,980
Uh, Thomas Tobey?

1538
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:16,980
Uh, yeah, Thomas Tobey.

1539
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:22,980
F.U. to Nikkari for wearing my shirt yesterday?

1540
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:24,980
I'm just kidding.

1541
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:27,980
Nikkari's my hero, what can I say?

1542
01:37:29,980 --> 01:37:34,980
Every day I polish my revolver, and I shoot myself in the head, like a rockstar.

1543
01:37:37,980 --> 01:37:41,980
Um, let's see, what other F.U.s do I have?

1544
01:37:41,980 --> 01:37:47,980
F you to Brad, he's a dick, and uh, alright, that's all I have to say for now, I guess.

1545
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:50,980
Brad's a dick, like a rockstar.

1546
01:37:50,980 --> 01:37:53,980
And F being single, it still sucks.

1547
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:58,980
Alright, locate!

1548
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:04,980
Well, I have a list only because every, um, I found a new use for my camera yesterday since it does record audio.

1549
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:10,980
I was doing FUs recorded into my camera as I was, you know, recording them.

1550
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:12,980
So I just typed them up to make it easier.

1551
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:14,980
Okay, let's start at the top of the list here.

1552
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:19,980
FU Raley's that's, uh, freakin' near, um, in Fremont, FU to them,

1553
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:21,980
because they don't have a Chinese food section.

1554
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:23,980
I really wanted Chinese food.

1555
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:27,980
They did not have Chinese food to go there, and that pissed me off.

1556
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:28,980
And on top of that?

1557
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:29,980
You know why that is, Loki?

1558
01:38:29,980 --> 01:38:33,980
Because right around that Raley's, there's like 50 bazillion Chinese restaurants.

1559
01:38:33,980 --> 01:38:37,740
that doesn't matter that doesn't matter at all to me but they did have cracker

1560
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:42,380

1592
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:46,400
Let's see, let's see, let's see.

1593
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:50,900
Um, F.U. to the minivan with license plate 4YKZ148.

1594
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:53,140
Haha!

1595
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:56,400
Um, you're a dumbass and you can't drive.

1596
01:40:56,400 --> 01:41:01,040
Um, listen, if you're gonna cut in front of us, stop trying to put on your brakes and shit, and guess what?

1597
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:05,280
Uh, minivans suck, uh, so you can burn in hell.

1598
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:09,000
Uh, and finally, finally, oh, oh, uh, one more.

1599
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:14,280
um another one is for derby club owners taking different to taking different tokens these tokens

1600
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:20,280
are so tiny i mean there's why are why don't you just use a standard token size i mean instead of

1601
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:25,480
having these machines that dispense you smaller tiny ass tokens for this machine it's expensive

1602
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:29,400
enough and i don't want to have to spend twenty dollars on some tokens and then find out oh look

1603
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:33,960
they don't fit in the damn machine there's financial reasons for that they say mgl has

1604
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:39,080
some deal with Sega for like the first 90 days or something they have a machine they have to use

1605
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:42,680
seven tokens so they can get an exact count of how much money they're making off of this plan.

1606
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:49,080
You mean they could just like oh no go into the freaking operator settings and see the freaking

1607
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:54,920
stats for that? Like any other machine on the face of the fucking planet? Well actually well

1608
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:59,080
there's a problem with that because if with all the double token deals they can't get they can't

1609
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:01,080
make it exactly

1610
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:03,080
why why why why why

1611
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:05,080
it doesn't really fucking matter okay

1612
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:07,080
you don't understand how arcades work

1613
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:09,080
you never worked it before

1614
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:11,080
this is why sega has no systems anymore

1615
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:13,080
finally

1616
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:15,080
may i finish

1617
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:17,080
okay

1618
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:19,080
finally

1619
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:21,080
and this is the biggest one of them all

1620
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:23,080
but people fucking cutting me off in the coiling

1621
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:25,080
i don't give a fuck if you're running the tournament

1622
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:27,080
announcing the freaking results for freestyle

1623
01:42:57,080 --> 01:43:01,080
And that's all.

1624
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:05,080
God damn, your face got hella red.

1625
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:10,080
That deserves applause there. There are veins popping out of his head in places you never knew there were veins.

1626
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:15,080
Any children listening to this, please do not tell your mother and not be intimidated like this.

1627
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:20,080
I'm just kidding about that vert, too. That's funny.

1628
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:25,080
By the way, you're being worshipped in the shower room right now.

1629
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:28,640

a big fucking hell to my bike because the tire went flat

1637
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:57,840
again, during class, so I ended up having to walk my bike around everywhere. I thought

1638
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:05,560
my F2 song was the cat song. I changed my mind. Well, fuck you then! Okay, um, yeah,

1639
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:13,040

1641
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:23,200
some old scrawny Russian dude that has such a horrible accent, it sounds like he's speaking

1642
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:28,800
Spanish instead of English. It's bad. I'm looking at, I'm trying to listen to what he's

1643
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:35,800
saying in the lecture and I'm like, what? What, did you say derivative or something

1644
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:39,280
else? I don't know what you're saying. I just want to stand up and yell at his face. He's

1645
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:46,280
like

1646
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:50,960
everybody in this room needs anger management courses right now

1647
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:56,320
i can manage my anger just fine by kicking someone's ass

1648
01:44:56,320 --> 01:45:03,320
that's what orange lounge is, it's our venting thing, you know, we don't wear anger out here

1649
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:08,320
No, it's not. I'm still going. I'm still going. I'm still going. I'm still going. I'm still...

1650
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:10,320
Yeah, it was just meditation.

1651
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:19,320
I have to also add to the fuck you on MapQuest, because next to them I had to sit in the backseat of Rob's car with having to piss.

1652
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:28,320
I sat there for probably about 45 minutes holding it while we were trying to find this damn pizza place driving around the wrong side of Fremont.

1653
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:34,400
We're going around Mission Boulevard up 680 up up 880 in a frick big frickin circle

1654
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:38,840
Well, it'll be one for a minute. It's a big car. I can roll over

1655
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:44,120
I'll just blame it on that guy. Of course the other guy in backseat was mad. Yeah

1656
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:49,600
And let's see what else

1657
01:45:49,600 --> 01:46:03,600
Fucked my car for having a bad timing belt in it because now I can't bring it up with me to Davis this quarter until it gets fixed and it's going to cost extra dollars to fix.

1658
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:08,600
And why are you messing with my dog? Don't abuse my dog!

1659
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:11,600
Well, you were trying to turn its tail into a cock, so it's...

1660
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:19,600
Well, let's see, I had one more. I think I had one more. I'm trying to remember what it is.

1661
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:29,600
Fuck my hard drive for being too small because I couldn't burn CDs because it didn't have enough room to copy the information.

1662
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:31,600
What's wrong, HardDriveEnvy?

1663
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:35,600
I only have a 20 gig hard drive. I feel so weak.

1664
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:38,600
I feel so weak and primitive.

1665
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:41,600
It's not size that matters, man.

1666
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:45,600
Wait, actually, this is hard drive talk, I forgot.

1667
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,600
Yes, size does matter.

1668
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,600
I still feel smart.

1669
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:52,600
Done? Are you done? Good.

1670
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:55,600
Okay, the following...

1671
01:46:55,600 --> 01:47:02,600
The following one, what to say, will be very affinity buildable until then under 17.

1672
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:04,600
Dave get out

1673
01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:11,560
But it's under 17, it's very offensive, but if you but if you want to listen anyways go ahead

1674
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:13,480
Don't blame me for everything. I'm gonna say

1675
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:19,440
Fuck shit cock piss cunt whore. Oh that's

1676
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,380
Okay, the first fuck you have to do it

1677
01:47:23,380 --> 01:47:31,940
it's not this game is one direction one time I got lost for 30 minutes it only

1678
01:47:31,940 --> 01:47:38,300
took me like 15 minutes to get there regularly that's my first house

1679
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:47,020
what gang fuck being cursed I'm always never gonna just do whatever I could do

1680
01:47:47,020 --> 01:47:52,020
Let me see. Oh yeah, here's the one big F you right here. A big F you right here.

1681
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:57,020
December 13th. Okay, Friday the 13th. The day of MGL.

1682
01:47:57,020 --> 01:48:01,020
This is the reason why explicit was destroyed.

1683
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:05,020
The alpha part. And why I switched to beta.

1684
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:12,020
Let me see. The first part that happened in the morning. I lost my damn disc that had almost all my final stuff I needed to turn in.

1685
01:48:12,020 --> 01:48:14,020
Which cost me like 20% of my grades.

1686
01:48:14,020 --> 01:48:22,520
great yes I had an A to a C or C B to a D which killed me so badly well I

1687
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:27,720
include computer science 15 yes computer programming and that the teacher said

1688
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:40,580
plagiarism for that he can kiss my ass I said my 12 minutes cock thank you for

1689
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:46,360
that visual

1690
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:49,400
that was you like throwing your cock across the room

1691
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:52,080
catch jamie, catch

1692
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:55,300
what do you mean to the word detachable penis

1693
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:59,660
okay that's it, let me see, back to the day of

1694
01:48:59,660 --> 01:49:02,780
MGL, Friday the 13th

1695
01:49:02,780 --> 01:49:06,740
I tried driving there, almost got into an accident, not my fault

1696
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:11,740
My car almost burned out because the car fan broke on my car.

1697
01:49:11,740 --> 01:49:15,740
It could have been stuck in the road out of nowhere.

1698
01:49:15,740 --> 01:49:18,740
And B.A. Hella sucks on M.G.O.

1699
01:49:18,740 --> 01:49:26,740
Because what the hell does a Qualifier song have to be so fucking hard compared to M.G.O. 2 Evil?

1700
01:49:26,740 --> 01:49:30,740
Work in my heart, reverse, dark, hidden.

1701
01:49:30,740 --> 01:49:32,740
Why does the rest of it have to be...

1702
01:49:32,740 --> 01:49:35,740
My idea.

1703
01:49:35,740 --> 01:49:45,740
You know, yesterday for Perfect Attack, the Qualifier song was Sugaru, Boost, Rever- No, it wasn't Rever- Boost, uh, Flat. Boost, Flat, Mirror.

1704
01:49:45,740 --> 01:49:52,740
Oh my god, I seeded 13th out of 16 people and I somehow came in 4th in the end. Don't ask me how that happened, anyway.

1705
01:49:52,740 --> 01:49:59,740
Well, Sugaru, that was the easy- That was easy shit. But then my book- How could you do it hidden, dark, reverse? That's like fucked up.

1706
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:01,740
What the song says.

1707
01:50:02,740 --> 01:50:04,740
This is fucked up.

1708
01:50:05,740 --> 01:50:07,740
Let me see.

1709
01:50:07,740 --> 01:50:11,740
As far as the PA part, that made me less interested in PA.

1710
01:50:11,740 --> 01:50:13,740
Thanks for helping, bitch.

1711
01:50:13,740 --> 01:50:15,740
I'm in jail.

1712
01:50:15,740 --> 01:50:18,740
Since it wasn't put in replay, I screwed up.

1713
01:50:18,740 --> 01:50:22,740
Yes, and I had to do an improv, a straight up improv.

1714
01:50:22,740 --> 01:50:24,740
Playing around, I actually knew the steps.

1715
01:50:24,740 --> 01:50:27,740
But it ended up being too obvious that everybody knew it was just an improv.

1716
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:32,740
Well, he's a nice place to live, but still, I wanted to do it for my real routine, which I work pretty hard on.

1717
01:50:32,740 --> 01:50:37,740
And I wasted hell on money. That means, like, how much money did I waste?

1718
01:50:37,740 --> 01:50:42,740
Fuck, I wasted 60 bucks total, because not many people pay me back for the balls.

1719
01:50:42,740 --> 01:50:46,740
Not everybody. Half the people pay me back for the balls.

1720
01:50:46,740 --> 01:50:49,740
They say, can I have a free try? Fuck, I have to waste money.

1721
01:50:49,740 --> 01:50:54,740
I almost didn't have enough money to pay for the gas money to come back to Sacramento.

1722
01:50:54,740 --> 01:51:08,740
In other words, I have to borrow money and end up being, I have to pay them back like 5 bucks more, because you get 5 bucks if you can borrow 10 bucks from me.

1723
01:51:08,740 --> 01:51:13,740
Just remember you gotta tell people you give favors like you give head.

1724
01:51:13,740 --> 01:51:15,740
Okay, that's too much to say right there.

1725
01:51:15,740 --> 01:51:19,740
It's, yeah, not at all. It's from Go.

1726
01:51:19,740 --> 01:51:21,740
I won't, yeah.

1727
01:51:21,740 --> 01:51:26,740
Yeah, but just to let you know, that day just killed my reputation.

1728
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:31,740
But now I'm a new person, so, hahaha, you can't kill me now!

1729
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:43,740
And I have some problems, fuck the incompatibility between StepMania and like, for some reason my Windows XP does not work with StepMania for some reason.

1730
01:51:43,740 --> 01:51:47,260
okay we'll keep up and put the server that kind of crashed on second money

1731
01:51:47,260 --> 01:51:52,060
forms that is a very fuck fuck fuck that server

1732
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:56,180
okay because I wanted to the big etiquette port concept yeah that one

1733
01:51:56,180 --> 01:51:59,660

1734
01:51:59,660 --> 01:52:03,220

for restoring us back to September without our permission.

1738
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:18,220
Yeah, I missed the make Eddie get porn contest. I couldn't sign in.

1739
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:21,060
I missed all the things I was going to get.

1740
01:52:21,060 --> 01:52:25,620
Since I'm like nineteen and a half, I would have been able to get the stuff.

1741
01:52:25,620 --> 01:52:27,820
I still got plenty left, man.

1742
01:52:27,820 --> 01:52:31,380
Don't worry about it. There ended up not being a contest because

1743
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:33,420
two people entered.

1744
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:35,320
I was born.

1745
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:38,940
And so I'm giving just porn out to everyone who entered. So I'll give you that.

It's not like I'm asking for much. I want two things.

1815
01:55:33,080 --> 01:55:36,760
One, that they like me. Two, that they're under 2,000 pounds.

1816
01:55:36,760 --> 01:55:38,680
That's all I ask.

1817
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:40,840
Dave, when you're 18, we'll buy you a whore.

1818
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:42,160

01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:44,840

I have the power! No, wait, that was He-Man. I don't know.

1835
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:35,360
Alright, let's get to the chatroom menus.

1836
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:37,360
You're going to have to cut these ones down, Rob, I think.

I'm going to read these fast. I'm doing speed reader, okay? Here we go.

1838
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:42,360

01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:50,660

Go to last night's entry and read at random. The whole story is there. Only reason I said

1868
01:58:46,900 --> 01:58:52,620
check my current journal post for the FU is because I don't know how to word it right.

1869
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:56,980
I thought our journals protected everybody anyway, so how are we going to read it? Well,

1870
01:58:56,980 --> 01:59:03,980
I have access, but anyway. Brad, shut the fuck up. 23rd Magus says, let Explicit know

1871
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:06,700
Not explicit, no, I'm working on my Maxell limited routine.

1872
01:59:06,700 --> 01:59:09,260
I have an F.U. to scroll once again.

1873
01:59:09,260 --> 01:59:11,180
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it in its fucking ear.

1874
01:59:11,180 --> 01:59:12,660
I also have an F.U. to stoic.

1875
01:59:12,660 --> 01:59:16,540
Before Jamie kills me, I'm talking about the steps by Chacrilla, not the song.

1876
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:18,940
The song is leet, the steps are masochistic to play.

1877
01:59:18,940 --> 01:59:23,500
Fuck 56k, I need to fucking download some MP3s for my DJ bit, and I get one song every

1878
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:24,500
half hour.

1879
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:25,500
What the fuck?

1880
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:26,500
Okay, out.

1881
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:27,500
I thought Jamie didn't like stoic.

1882
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:28,500
Okay.

1883
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:32,660
Wait, so the play-through magazine actually related to talking to me?

1884
01:59:32,660 --> 01:59:33,660
Jamie doesn't like stoics.

1885
01:59:33,660 --> 01:59:35,660
Oh, yes, that's what I thought, Magus.

1886
01:59:35,660 --> 01:59:36,660
Good luck.

1887
01:59:36,660 --> 01:59:40,660
It's not as easy as you think, though, unless if you're doing beginner mode.

1888
01:59:40,660 --> 01:59:42,660
Yeah, there's a beginner mode, actually.

1889
01:59:42,660 --> 01:59:44,660
But, anyway, just good luck.

1890
01:59:44,660 --> 01:59:46,660
I want to see the routine sometime.

1891
01:59:46,660 --> 01:59:49,660
I want to see the Legend of Max on maniac routine.

1892
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:50,660
Good luck.

1893
01:59:50,660 --> 01:59:51,660
You'll need it.

1894
01:59:51,660 --> 01:59:52,660
Oh, God.

1895
01:59:52,660 --> 01:59:54,660
SoCalKick says,

1896
01:59:54,660 --> 02:00:00,660
Fuck Saturday school for being four hours and very, very, very fucking retarded and run by the most ignorant teachers.

1897
02:00:00,660 --> 02:00:05,360
Fuck you to whoever was in the car that drove by me and Owen last night after watching Catch Me If You Can yelling,

1898
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:07,960
eat shit and die, faggot, at me.

1899
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:10,600
Why were you at Saturday school, huh?

1900
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:11,720
What's up?

1901
02:00:11,720 --> 02:00:12,760
Bad boy.

1902
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:15,080
Bad.

1903
02:00:15,080 --> 02:00:17,000
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

1904
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,280
Hey, get on with it, guys.

1905
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:23,080
Bombay, fuck you to Roseville Golf Land for getting extreme before Scandia and sucking.

1906
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:25,840
Bombay, fuck you and sucking. Good power.

1907
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:27,120
Hey.

1908
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:29,120
Hey, you apologize right now, sir.

1909
02:00:29,120 --> 02:00:30,420
No, he knows I won't.

1910
02:00:30,420 --> 02:00:31,120
Oh, okay.

1911
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:32,120
But not like that.

1912
02:00:32,120 --> 02:00:36,620
VidPalace says, fuck you to restaurant customers who have 30 people in their party and only tip $1.

1913
02:00:36,620 --> 02:00:38,120
Oh, ho, ho, that's rude.

1914
02:00:38,120 --> 02:00:41,120
Because they supposedly only have enough money to pay the bill, but not enough to tip.

1915
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:43,120
That's why you're supposed to add the money on the bill.

1916
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:47,120
Actually, I thought that large parties over 15 and gratuity is supposed to be added.

1917
02:00:47,120 --> 02:00:51,120
Yeah, I always thought that if you bring in a party to a restaurant with more than 8 people, gratuity is automatically added.

1918
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:52,120
That's what always happens to me.

1919
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:53,120
Yeah, what the fuck.

1920
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:55,120
Must be a Vegas thing.

1921
02:00:55,120 --> 02:01:02,120
Fuck you to the WB for not re-showing Everward on their Easyview today, because that show is awesome.

1922
02:01:02,120 --> 02:01:07,120
Actually, I saw the Easyview today. It was a small bill, I saw.

1923
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:16,120
Fuck you to not getting any free stuff at CES, fuck you to semester exams for being worth 20% of your semester grade, and yes, let's like to rave.

1924
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:22,120
Chubbs! Fuck you to being sick because it made my PA suck. Fuck you to Mr. Cool for being a douche.

1925
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:29,120
And last but not least, bug you to Orange Lounge for not interviewing me at Fremont.

1926
02:01:30,120 --> 02:01:37,120
All I have to say to you is, cry a little more. I'm just kidding.

1927
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:48,120
Strasa says, private message to me. Angel says, fuck you to my co-worker for bitching over me getting her one dollar bill.

1928
02:01:48,120 --> 02:01:55,120
getting her one dollar bill. It's just a dollar, bitch. Fuck you, fuck you in your ear, Jamie.

1929
02:01:55,120 --> 02:01:59,600
You for that quote. Oh, thank you, Jamie, for that quote. Moving on. Vidpowah says they

1930
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:05,480
don't add to the tip because they're nice. Jamie, that's lovely. Now I've got to go to

1931
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:11,560
the email bag just for Muhimer's F.U. because he's the only one that sends me F.U.s over

1932
02:02:11,560 --> 02:02:16,480
email. Muhimer says fuck me for always sending my fuck yous by email. Yes, you're in the

02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:19,840
chat room why do you use email oh well it's okay it's all good gives us an excuse to go

1936
02:02:29,060 --> 02:02:33,660
my thoughts while being stomped on by people and then being told that i can't eat food

1939
02:02:45,460 --> 02:02:49,700

1940
02:02:49,700 --> 02:02:54,980
and they suck.

1941
02:02:54,980 --> 02:03:00,860
Alright, with that ladies and gentlemen, we're done with the FUs of the week.

1942
02:03:00,860 --> 02:03:03,180
Oh my god, that went for an hour.

1943
02:03:03,180 --> 02:03:05,680
That was cool.

1944
02:03:05,680 --> 02:03:09,280
This has been Anxed Hour on the Anxed Out Radio.

1945
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:11,260
And I'm spent.

1946
02:03:11,260 --> 02:03:12,260
Back to sanity.

1947
02:03:12,260 --> 02:03:13,260
Wow.

1948
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:14,260
Anxed?

1949
02:03:14,260 --> 02:03:15,260
Same?

1950
02:03:15,260 --> 02:03:20,660
Are we even going to do like a listless or anything like that?

1951
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:23,340
I don't know if we're going to have time because we got to do the cage match.

1952
02:03:23,340 --> 02:03:25,980
We're going to come back and we're going to do the cage match.

1953
02:03:25,980 --> 02:03:28,340
After the cage match, if we have time for a listless, we'll do one.

1954
02:03:28,340 --> 02:03:32,980
If not, we dig that bit in the ground anyway, right?

1955
02:03:32,980 --> 02:03:35,100
Do we have any ideas for a listless?

1956
02:03:35,100 --> 02:03:36,740
We'll think about them over commercial.

1957
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:39,300
You shut up, look.

1958
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:42,100
In the meantime, more extreme shit.

1959
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:43,100
Enjoy.

1960
02:03:43,100 --> 02:03:45,100
Play me after it's closed

1961
02:04:13,100 --> 02:04:15,100
Over and over and over you

1962
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:18,100
I'd never get over you

1963
02:04:19,100 --> 02:04:22,100
Over you, over you, over you

1964
02:04:22,100 --> 02:04:24,100
Never over you

1965
02:04:24,100 --> 02:04:26,100
For the sun will shine

1966
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:28,100
If you stay mine

1967
02:04:28,100 --> 02:04:31,100
There could never be a cloudy day

1968
02:04:31,100 --> 02:04:34,100
Shining, shining, shining through

1969
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:37,100
All the love that I feel for you

1970
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:40,100
I wish you would stay mine

1971
02:04:40,100 --> 02:04:42,100
Until the end

1972
02:04:42,100 --> 02:04:55,100
Oh, my love is flowing deeper, oh, my love is flowing deeper

1973
02:04:55,100 --> 02:04:59,100
Father, son, for time, a new day will come

1974
02:04:59,100 --> 02:05:05,100
Our love will keep on flowing, flowing and flowing, flowing through

1975
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:09,100
The love I'll always feel for you

1976
02:05:09,100 --> 02:05:14,100
You will stay mine until the end of time

1977
02:05:14,100 --> 02:05:16,100
Until the end of time

1978
02:05:16,100 --> 02:05:22,100
Only for you until the end

1979
02:05:52,100 --> 02:06:00,100
I want to take you home

1980
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:03,100
Freakin' heartache

1981
02:06:03,100 --> 02:06:06,100
From the two of me

1982
02:06:06,100 --> 02:06:09,100
I know you feel me

1983
02:06:09,100 --> 02:06:13,100
I know

1984
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:16,100
Maybe, maybe, maybe you hide

1985
02:06:16,100 --> 02:06:19,100
Maybe, maybe, maybe

1986
02:06:19,100 --> 02:06:45,820
What's that party? What's that party? Go on get down.

1987
02:06:45,820 --> 02:06:49,220
Oh, go with me, oh, go with me

1988
02:06:49,220 --> 02:06:53,220
And I know

1989
02:06:53,220 --> 02:06:56,220
The music makes you hot

1990
02:06:56,220 --> 02:07:00,220
The music and the power

1991
02:08:26,220 --> 02:08:35,220
We are what we're supposed to be

1992
02:08:35,220 --> 02:08:38,220
Illusions on your fantasy

1993
02:08:38,220 --> 02:08:40,220
All of the lies you seek or fake

1994
02:08:40,220 --> 02:08:43,220
What you do is what you wish to do

1995
02:08:43,220 --> 02:08:46,220
We are the God of Symphony

1996
02:08:46,220 --> 02:08:48,220
We do the things you want to see

1997
02:08:48,220 --> 02:08:51,220
Bring my friends to the extreme

1998
02:08:51,220 --> 02:08:54,220
Our friends are so unreasonable

1999
02:08:54,220 --> 02:08:57,220
Say to the unpredictable

2000
02:08:57,220 --> 02:08:59,220
I doubt a lie if you speak and say

2001
02:08:59,220 --> 02:09:03,220
What we do is what you wish to do

2002
02:09:03,220 --> 02:09:05,220
That's all I know, best for our friends

2003
02:09:05,220 --> 02:09:08,220
Showing off the little things

2004
02:09:08,220 --> 02:09:10,220
Bring my friends to the extreme

2005
02:09:10,220 --> 02:09:13,220
One by one, we make it in fun

2006
02:09:13,220 --> 02:09:16,220
We are the central heroes of the world

2007
02:09:16,220 --> 02:09:19,220
We are the ones who've got our hands on our back

2008
02:09:19,220 --> 02:09:21,220
To stay by your back, raise your mind

2009
02:09:21,220 --> 02:09:28,220
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute my girl from Mel B can join

2010
02:09:51,220 --> 02:09:54,220
and join us on all the fun together.

2011
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:58,220
Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to

2012
02:09:58,220 --> 02:10:03,220
and still the fun is just as great. It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

2013
02:10:03,220 --> 02:10:09,220
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life aren't free.

2014
02:10:09,220 --> 02:10:12,220
Yes, Irene has an important announcement.

2015
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:13,220
We're coming back from break.

2016
02:10:13,220 --> 02:10:14,220
I paid off my debt.

2017
02:10:14,220 --> 02:10:15,220
I hate you!

2018
02:10:15,220 --> 02:10:16,220
I hate you.

2019
02:10:16,220 --> 02:10:20,220
And so I'm going to get a two-story house before you...

2020
02:10:20,220 --> 02:10:26,140
A cunt. A real fucking cunt, you know that? Why are you letting her be better than me

2021
02:10:26,140 --> 02:10:33,140
at Animal Crossing? This sucks. Ow, ow, ow, ow, my tummy. I was just thinking of something.

2022
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:39,100
I paid off my house all the way. So did Dan. We have statues of ourselves.

2023
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:47,460
Well, you know what you and Dan are? Cool. Yeah, you're kind of cool. I was just thinking,

2024
02:10:47,460 --> 02:10:52,660
I had a revelation. You know why Mel said that he was a broke-ass?

2025
02:10:52,660 --> 02:10:53,660
Oh, in that commercial, yes.

2026
02:10:53,660 --> 02:10:54,660
Because of DOC.

2027
02:10:54,660 --> 02:10:56,740
Yeah, because of Derby Owners Club.

2028
02:10:56,740 --> 02:10:58,500
And I'm addicted to it now.

2029
02:10:58,500 --> 02:10:59,500
No, I actually...

2030
02:10:59,500 --> 02:11:03,800
I've played one game, I have a horse, I want to play more!

2031
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:05,500
Labrador Lover.

2032
02:11:05,500 --> 02:11:07,020
I can make a better name than that for anyone.

2033
02:11:07,020 --> 02:11:15,140
The reason why Mel B. I had to play that promo is because they might be back at the end of

2034
02:11:15,140 --> 02:11:19,420
the month, I know at least one of them is hopefully going to be coming up, Sharks Girl,

2035
02:11:19,420 --> 02:11:25,540
the other half, might be bringing Mel B with her, might not, but either way we like Mel,

2036
02:11:25,540 --> 02:11:27,620
so hopefully he'll be back at the show at some point.

2037
02:11:27,620 --> 02:11:32,740
Also in the future, I've been promised a visit from Chubbs and Maple at some point, so I'm

2038
02:11:32,740 --> 02:11:37,620
going to make them do that, and don't know what other guests we'll have on the show in

2039
02:11:37,620 --> 02:11:38,620
the future.

2040
02:11:38,620 --> 02:11:43,620
Let's get No Styling on Cory at the same time.

2041
02:11:43,620 --> 02:11:45,620
No Stylin' on Cory Action?

2042
02:11:45,620 --> 02:11:46,620
Oh!

2043
02:11:46,620 --> 02:11:47,620
Alright.

2044
02:11:47,620 --> 02:11:51,700
We need to get, we seriously need to get, um, Darkstone back up here.

2045
02:11:51,700 --> 02:11:52,700
Yes.

2046
02:11:52,700 --> 02:11:53,700
Oh!

2047
02:11:53,700 --> 02:11:54,700
That reminds me!

2048
02:11:54,700 --> 02:11:55,700
Thank you!

2049
02:11:55,700 --> 02:12:01,140
Next week, I have a three-day weekend, which means I don't have to work on Monday, which

2050
02:12:01,140 --> 02:12:04,340
means I can have a hangover if I want.

2051
02:12:04,340 --> 02:12:05,880
Which means...

2052
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:11,580
Which means that since Shami never gets hangovers, she can drink all she wants to anyway.

2053
02:12:11,580 --> 02:12:13,500
Next week, on Orange Lounge Radio...

2054
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:18,300

02:12:43,480 --> 02:12:48,480

02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:56,480
But you can make really good butterscotch milkshakes with Goldschlager.

2062

You use butterscotch.

all right

2116
02:15:30,180 --> 02:15:34,180
Well, actually, I should say the end of last week was a big week.

2117
02:15:34,180 --> 02:15:37,180
It was the Trinity Mix 3 results.

2118
02:15:37,180 --> 02:15:43,180
And, well, you know, I hate you all for not playing my freaking file.

2119
02:15:43,180 --> 02:15:45,180
You can burn in hell.

2120
02:15:45,180 --> 02:15:47,180
Well, I'll say that for another day.

2121
02:15:47,180 --> 02:15:52,180
So, anyways, we've got the results, the official and the public results for the voting.

2122
02:15:52,180 --> 02:15:56,180
First place, there was a tie between spin and simple and clean.

2123
02:15:56,180 --> 02:16:05,180
1. Invoke 2. Boom Boom Dollar

2124
02:16:26,180 --> 02:16:28,880
First place for Heavy was Invoke.

2125
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:31,800
Second place was Stoic, done by Moogle Hunter.

2126
02:16:31,800 --> 02:16:32,800
It's really crazy.

2127
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:33,800
Yay, Moogle, yay!

2128
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:38,020
Third place was Su-4, which is a remix of Volume 4 and Sagaru.

2129
02:16:38,020 --> 02:16:43,300
It's kind of like Volume 4 with the Sagaru twanging in it.

2130
02:16:43,300 --> 02:16:44,500
It was interesting.

2131
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:46,740
Standard, first place was Eat Em Up.

2132
02:16:46,740 --> 02:16:55,980
It was a Pac-Man song from Ridge Racer Type 4, which you might be hearing later.

2133
02:16:55,980 --> 02:17:04,800
Second place is Blue Fever, which is a speed mix of Blue by Eiffel65, and third place was

2134
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:05,800
Arian also.

2135
02:17:05,800 --> 02:17:08,560
Oh my god, it's the Hidden Sevens Style song.

2136
02:17:08,560 --> 02:17:10,200
You still have it unlocked.

2137
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:11,200
Guess what?

2138
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:15,000
Anyways, so, what do I have to say about this?

2139
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Well, you know what?

2140
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,320
I'm checking to see what place Loki got.

2141
02:17:18,320 --> 02:17:20,440
I got like 18th or something.

2142
02:17:20,440 --> 02:17:25,440
You got, uh, let's see, 40, yeah, where are they?

2143
02:17:25,440 --> 02:17:26,440
Uh, keep going down.

2144
02:17:26,440 --> 02:17:27,440
Wait, wait, wait, there it is.

2145
02:17:27,440 --> 02:17:28,440
Oh, I got 50.

2146
02:17:28,440 --> 02:17:29,440
50 out of 68.

2147
02:17:29,440 --> 02:17:33,440
You were 50th out of 68 people.

2148
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:34,440
That's because...

2149
02:17:34,440 --> 02:17:35,440
What the hell?

2150
02:17:35,440 --> 02:17:36,440
Okay.

2151
02:17:36,440 --> 02:17:37,440
What the hell?

2152
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:38,440
All right, let's see.

2153
02:17:38,440 --> 02:17:41,440
You got beat by the theme of Strider Hyrule.

2154
02:17:41,440 --> 02:17:42,440
Hyrule.

2155
02:17:42,440 --> 02:17:45,440
First of all, Strider Hyrule is cool.

2156
02:17:45,440 --> 02:17:50,940
Do you know what that, Strider, the best Capcom game ever are?

2157
02:17:50,940 --> 02:17:58,940
Anyways, um, I basically, I have a song that basically sums up my feelings along with someone else's feelings about Tourney Mix 3, so um,

2158
02:17:58,940 --> 02:18:05,940
Uh, if Rob, if you will do me the pleasure of, uh, playing an MP3 for me, Earth to Rob.

2159
02:18:05,940 --> 02:18:08,940
I'm sorry, Jamie's yelling at me, because I made her cry.

2160
02:18:08,940 --> 02:18:11,940
Well, sorry, um, could you play an MP3 for me?

2161
02:18:11,940 --> 02:18:12,940
I suppose, what?

2162
02:18:12,940 --> 02:18:14,940
I had an idea of that, like, way along with whatever song you wrote.

2163
02:18:42,940 --> 02:18:47,020
and

2164
02:18:47,020 --> 02:18:49,100
gave fire

2165
02:18:49,100 --> 02:18:51,700
plays one

2166
02:18:51,700 --> 02:18:54,700
this is my thoughts of turning mix

2167
02:18:54,700 --> 02:19:01,700
uh...

2168
02:19:02,220 --> 02:19:05,220
uh...

2169
02:19:05,220 --> 02:19:08,220
uh...

2170
02:19:08,220 --> 02:19:10,980
uh...

2171
02:19:10,980 --> 02:19:13,980
So teach your name and sparkle to the deck, so give it one more try

2172
02:19:13,980 --> 02:19:16,980
The cocksuckers will remember me from Ptolemy's school

2173
02:19:16,980 --> 02:19:19,980
The guy who made that duke of your ideals, I will never do

2174
02:19:19,980 --> 02:19:22,980
Just because you're an enemy is all the generic trans shit

2175
02:19:22,980 --> 02:19:25,980
You show a rocker's book, that was a crazy fucking gift

2176
02:19:25,980 --> 02:19:28,980
Well now I'm back to rock your world, my honest fucking life

2177
02:19:28,980 --> 02:19:31,980
Why you pussies don't realize you needed to survive

2178
02:19:31,980 --> 02:19:34,980
Trapped inside a tool and saved the secrets of the world

2179
02:19:34,980 --> 02:19:37,980
A wonderful place to science, music are the magic meld

2180
02:19:37,980 --> 02:19:40,640
All you motherfuckers want a job so rip the bar

2181
02:19:40,640 --> 02:19:43,720
Bro fuck you or fuck your mum, go back to Ulala

2182
02:19:43,720 --> 02:19:46,800
But if you got an ounce of sense then stay and fucking lose it

2183
02:19:46,800 --> 02:19:49,720
Life doesn't happen all at once so why'd you fucking use it?

2184
02:19:49,720 --> 02:19:52,680
Mr. Carlos' arrows fill the screen, you're probably all just thinking

2185
02:19:52,680 --> 02:19:55,680
On the way to this my lead is working, set my spirits sinking

2186
02:19:55,680 --> 02:19:58,600
Well come on these fuckers here's bad news, I don't give a shit

2187
02:19:58,600 --> 02:20:01,720
So take this fucking freeze arrow and ram it up your clip

2188
02:20:01,720 --> 02:20:04,520
All these shames would want to do is show you the meaning of life

2189
02:20:04,520 --> 02:20:07,560
Maybe you'll just throw it back at me, you had a sharp knife

2190
02:20:07,560 --> 02:20:10,560
Well, I'm not wasting any time on shit like you and I'll fucking tell you why

2191
02:20:10,560 --> 02:20:13,560
I don't want you to find happiness in your life, I want you to rather die

2192
02:20:13,560 --> 02:20:16,560
Fucking stitch my heart, go word, it's on the yokey stick

2193
02:20:16,560 --> 02:20:19,560
It's taught a mix, you go to hell, that service is a brick

2194
02:20:19,560 --> 02:20:22,560
So all you arses can go back to your faggot little dunce

2195
02:20:22,560 --> 02:20:25,560
DJ Damien signing out, you motherfucking nuts

2196
02:20:33,560 --> 02:20:35,560
That made Captain Jack fart

2197
02:20:35,560 --> 02:20:47,560
And for those who didn't know, that was DJ Damien with Art 2. He did a really shitty entry the first Turning Mix 2, and he did a really shitty entry for Turning Mix 3, but you know what? That song is funny.

2198
02:20:47,560 --> 02:21:02,560
Basically, the fault I have to say in this, and a lot of people have problems, is there are so many files entered. Obviously, I'm not surprised that I didn't get picked as far as voting goes, because people have to play like freaking a hundred files.

2199
02:21:02,560 --> 02:21:06,920
files and that's just unreasonable. I mean, to even expect people to play all the files.

2200
02:21:06,920 --> 02:21:12,360
So, it's kind of unfair there because everyone that wasn't known didn't get their files played.

2201
02:21:12,360 --> 02:21:17,400
So, you know, that kind of sucks but whatever, you know, I could do it better so I probably

2202
02:21:17,400 --> 02:21:25,240
will. As far as sim stuff goes, my new site is actually sort of online right now. I'm

2203
02:21:25,240 --> 02:21:29,880
uploading pages and content later on this week. I've sent out emails, a mass email to

2204
02:21:29,880 --> 02:21:35,120
a bunch of different people at Simfile Creators out there. And so far I've only gotten one

2205
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:38,440
response back. So I'm sending out another email to you guys and it's going to basically

2206
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:42,480
be if you don't send me back an email, I'm getting an okay to put your files on my site.

2207
02:21:42,480 --> 02:21:47,060
So if you don't want that happening, you better send me a fucking email. So my site's coming

2208
02:21:47,060 --> 02:21:55,060
up. The URL for it is going to be www.willddrforfood.net slash leachfromloki. And there's already a

2209
02:21:55,060 --> 02:21:59,480
main page up there right now but of course none of the links work because I haven't uploaded

2210
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:04,680
anything else yet. So, you can check that out right now and there should be more stuff

2211
02:22:04,680 --> 02:22:10,840
coming up later this week. I'm shooting for the early part of this week, but I don't know.

2212
02:22:10,840 --> 02:22:16,760
We'll see. And I'll be offering, there'll be places, an actual script where you can

2213
02:22:16,760 --> 02:22:21,100
upload your own files and even at your own page with your own files on it if you want

2214
02:22:21,100 --> 02:22:24,800
or else I'll make you a page. Basically, we're just going to have the largest collection

2215
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:29,920
of stuff on there. So, basically, you know, you'll see that there's going to be...

2216
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:32,920
Do you have crap like that one in your collection too?

2217
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:37,800
Why not? Some people want to play that. So, maybe we'll put that in a section of files

2218
02:22:37,800 --> 02:22:43,000
that suck or something like that. I don't know. It really doesn't matter to me. So,

2219
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:47,640
other than that, let's see. I think I'm going to have, there's going to be some interviews

2220
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:50,920
with Simfile Creators and we're going to do like some themes or releases and that kind

2221
02:22:50,920 --> 02:22:55,360
thing so it'll be fun to watch and you'll see there's already a group of

2222
02:22:55,360 --> 02:22:59,520
people baumannysims.com that's sort of doing the same similar thing that I think

2223
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:03,000
they've beat me to it because you know they put their site up first but site

2224
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:07,400
looks like shit and they don't really have that much right now but we're gonna

2225
02:23:07,400 --> 02:23:12,000
be strong battle lines yeah we're gonna see way do you see like a thousand files

2226
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:18,720
come online just all of a sudden so you know take that and whatever and uh take

2227
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:25,200
up your clit. Alright, we need to get to the cage match because we got to get that done

2228
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:30,160
definitely. That's one segment we have to do each week. Last week in the Orange Launch

2229
02:23:30,160 --> 02:23:37,440
cage match we had Yumi Hamasaki won for the second week in a row with Connected and I'll

2230
02:23:37,440 --> 02:23:40,800
play a clip of that in the second. First, I'm going to explain the cage match for you guys.

2231
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:45,840
This is when we take three songs, we battle them against each other, you guys vote on your favorite

2232
02:23:45,840 --> 02:23:51,080
And the winner goes into rotation during the Bomani Music Amore program, which plays 24

2233
02:23:51,080 --> 02:23:54,720
hours a day on this station when we're not here.

2234
02:23:54,720 --> 02:23:58,280
So let's hear a clip of last week's winner.

2235
02:23:58,280 --> 02:24:00,960
We're not going to play the full song, although you can still vote for it.

2236
02:24:00,960 --> 02:24:04,960
And if it does win this week, it gets retired next week, because we'll have won for a month

2237
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:06,000
straight.

2238
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,560
This is Ayumi Hamasaki with Connected, last week's winner.

2239
02:24:38,560 --> 02:25:06,080
Alright, that's Yumi Yamasaki with Connected, that's your first candidate in the Orange

2240
02:25:06,080 --> 02:25:08,080
Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match

2241
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:37,080
Eggman

2242
02:25:39,080 --> 02:25:40,080
Eggman

2243
02:25:41,080 --> 02:25:42,080

Yum yum

2247

Ad mayo't

2248
02:28:32,180 --> 02:28:36,220
Ad mayo't

2249
02:28:36,220 --> 02:28:39,440
Ad mayo't

2250
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:42,880
Ad mayo't

2251
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:46,220
Ad mayo't

2252
02:28:46,220 --> 02:28:49,640
Ad mayo't

2253
02:28:49,720 --> 02:28:51,740
Aaaaaaa

2254
02:28:51,740 --> 02:28:58,740
the

2255
02:28:59,040 --> 02:29:02,360
world's it was going to the next one there so I'm gonna get the first time

2256
02:29:02,360 --> 02:29:05,800
I was too busy telling not not jokes this car room

2257
02:29:05,800 --> 02:29:08,980
I'll feedback on that a

2258
02:29:08,980 --> 02:29:12,000
pac-man what is not you my I affects with

2259
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:16,000
I like it

2260
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:19,160
it was like a really bad I nightmare warm water

2261
02:29:19,160 --> 02:29:26,160
there

2262
02:29:27,120 --> 02:29:29,480
where your music

2263
02:29:29,480 --> 02:29:31,720
uh... no i didn't like it very much right

2264
02:29:31,720 --> 02:29:34,720
i mean if it's one of the really cool but

2265
02:29:34,720 --> 02:29:36,840
it's always just really repetitive

2266
02:29:36,840 --> 02:29:41,160
so i'll give it

2267
02:29:41,160 --> 02:29:43,720
here

2268
02:29:43,720 --> 02:29:47,720
i would

2269
02:29:47,720 --> 02:29:50,720
fact

2270
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:54,240
yes i think what you're going to think it's playing in my direction

2271
02:29:54,240 --> 02:29:57,920
and i don't care

2272
02:29:57,920 --> 02:29:59,040
uh...

2273
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:01,960
who's like

2274
02:30:01,960 --> 02:30:06,480
yeah i would

2275
02:30:06,480 --> 02:30:12,480
I just had a ferret hit me in the face.

2276
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:16,480
Let's see, the song, I'll probably give it an 8.5 out of 10. It's a pretty good song.

2277
02:30:16,480 --> 02:30:22,980
It's a pretty good song, but for some reason, I feel like Ayumi better for some reason.

2278
02:30:22,980 --> 02:30:25,180
But this song's pretty classic, though.

2279
02:30:25,180 --> 02:30:27,780
They could've done a little better, but it's pretty good.

2280
02:30:27,780 --> 02:30:32,880
I give it a 7, because I think that's about the highest stage I ever got to on Pac-Man.

2281
02:30:32,880 --> 02:30:36,880
All right, next up, Blokey, tell us about the other songs in the cage match.

2282
02:30:36,880 --> 02:30:40,880
The next one, you might remember her stuff from DR Max 2.

2283
02:30:40,880 --> 02:30:43,520
She did the song today, this is Tesla Confusion.

2284
02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:38,240
I don't know what I'm gonna do to make you see that I'm free

2285
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:41,740
I'm free to say, I'm free to leave, I'm free to do what I feel

2286
02:31:41,740 --> 02:31:45,240
But I'm not sure if what I want, I need to take it over

2287
02:31:45,240 --> 02:31:48,240
When you're away, I feel confused

2288
02:32:48,240 --> 02:32:53,240
I want to be beside you, I want to say you're on my knees I want to know what you feel

2289
02:32:53,240 --> 02:32:59,240
You need to know when you're around that there's a cure but later when you're away I feel from you

2290
02:33:23,240 --> 02:33:28,240
p0k3smot42o muhaha

2291
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:53,120
Oh, uh, woah, hello, that's the wrong one, my bad.

2292
02:33:53,120 --> 02:33:55,240
Uh, that was Test with Confusion.

2293
02:33:55,240 --> 02:34:02,240
and

2294
02:34:03,560 --> 02:34:10,560
on a scale of 110

2295
02:34:11,680 --> 02:34:14,000
i like it

2296
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:17,920
and no i don't think my songs pretty mixed three at

2297
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:19,760
the full version

2298
02:34:19,760 --> 02:34:21,480
not a cut-down version

2299
02:34:21,480 --> 02:34:25,360
But yes, I do pick my music files from my Sim collection.

2300
02:34:25,360 --> 02:34:28,720
See, we're close. I give you half a point.

2301
02:34:28,720 --> 02:34:31,380
But, uh, I'll give it a nine.

2302
02:34:31,380 --> 02:34:32,960
Uh, let's see, um...

2303
02:34:32,960 --> 02:34:34,640
It was better than the Pac-Man song.

2304
02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:37,880
I... I...

2305
02:34:37,880 --> 02:34:41,880
And Jamie, stay over here kicking me on the floor.

2306
02:34:41,880 --> 02:34:43,440
Yeah, she's doing it as a dick. Ow!

2307
02:34:43,440 --> 02:34:45,040
Don't...

2308
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:47,120
You're beating me up. Um...

2309
02:34:47,120 --> 02:34:51,000
Yeah, uh... I give it an eight and a half.

2310
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
You need to do that more often.

2311
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
I think that sounds very great.

2312
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
What, you like me kicking you?

2313
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:00,000
The scores are probably good, there's a...

2314
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
9.8 out of 10.

2315
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
You need to kick people more often, not me.

2316
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
It's gonna be a very good battle, but some person...

2317
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
And why did you...

2318
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:11,000
Jimmy just took my hat off and put it on Rob.

2319
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
I also prefer Ayumi for a while.

2320
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
Ooh, a chick fight.

2321
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:16,000
TNA.

2322
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
What the hell are you talking about?

2323
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Yes, versus Ayumi.

2324
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:37,240
I thought it was pretty groovy. I also, I also give that song a seven. Okay. So anyway,

2325
02:35:37,240 --> 02:35:42,560
you can vote for, you can send in your votes now. Send them as a private message to me

2326
02:35:42,560 --> 02:35:49,480
in the chat room right now. You can vote for Connected by Ayumi Masamasaki. You can vote

2327
02:36:19,480 --> 02:36:29,480
So now, instead of going back to break, since we just played some music, you have to send me PMs so they don't count. Don't type them in the main channel because I don't count them there.

2328
02:36:29,480 --> 02:36:34,480
So, uh, explicit's given a kick out of just reading you people in the chatroom.

2329
02:36:34,480 --> 02:36:39,480
Um, black-eyed, did you have something you wanted to say?

2330
02:36:39,480 --> 02:36:42,480
I have the microphone right now, I figured you had something you wanted to say.

2331
02:36:42,480 --> 02:36:47,480
Why? My hat does not look dumb.

2332
02:36:47,480 --> 02:36:52,480
Oh, I'm cool, because I wear my hat backwards.

2333
02:36:52,480 --> 02:36:53,480
Yeah.

2334
02:36:53,480 --> 02:36:59,880
Anyway, did we figure out if we can do our segment that we wanted to do?

2335
02:36:59,880 --> 02:37:03,480
I mean, I've got, I can talk about something, man.

2336
02:37:03,480 --> 02:37:04,480
Okay, great.

2337
02:37:04,480 --> 02:37:11,000
Then we're going to talk about, we're going to introduce a new segment on this big show.

2338
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:15,920
It's time everybody, sit around, bring in the family, sit around the radio, get the

2339
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:21,200
kids in, tuck them into bed, because it's time for a new segment on Orange Lawns.

2340
02:37:21,200 --> 02:37:24,080
Now we kind of did this a while ago, except it wasn't an official segment.

2341
02:37:24,080 --> 02:37:27,920
You might remember a few weeks ago, I don't remember what episode number it is, but maybe

2342
02:37:27,920 --> 02:37:31,440
somebody like Angel, who knows, she knows this show in and out, she's very smart when

2343
02:37:31,440 --> 02:37:34,920
it comes to this show, she might remember what episode number this was, when Loki talked

2344
02:37:34,920 --> 02:37:37,760
about his experience with the Hooker.

2345
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:40,920
I don't remember what episode that was, but, was it 20?

2346
02:37:40,920 --> 02:37:43,360
Oh, Black Lab, that was when he was here, it was 20.

2347
02:37:43,360 --> 02:37:46,320
Okay, in episode twenty you talked about the black lab, er,

2348
02:37:46,320 --> 02:37:50,140
I didn't talk about the hooker who was named Black Lab, no. She was black though, wait.

2349
02:37:50,140 --> 02:37:54,540
Anyway, so we thought we'd make a whole segment out of this in the future. Ladies and gentlemen,

2350
02:37:54,540 --> 02:38:00,120
give it up for Storytime with Loki.

2351
02:38:00,120 --> 02:38:01,880
Alright, so, uh...

2352
02:38:01,880 --> 02:38:04,960
Hold on, I'm sorry, I have to bring in your music, Loki.

2353
02:38:04,960 --> 02:38:09,120
So what are you going to be telling us the story about tonight? Well, I'm going to talk about the time

2354
02:38:09,120 --> 02:38:14,440
that I went to goth night at the rage in sacramento's club that we've got down here and you know

2355
02:38:14,440 --> 02:38:19,680
me kind of you know really I don't get out that much but when I do it's just weird shit

2356
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:24,160
that happens so that's why we have you know story time so this is about like I went to

2357
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:31,440
goth night well let me let me introduce this okay all right so before I was dating my girlfriend

2358
02:38:31,440 --> 02:38:36,940
right now. Um, I was dating this other girl who, um, her name was Forest. Um, she was

2359
02:38:36,940 --> 02:38:44,640
a cr- No, she was not dark black. Well, well, I'm not going to comp- Well, yeah, okay. The

2360
02:38:44,640 --> 02:38:48,160
forest was very thick, but that's not what I'm going to talk about here. Okay, so basically

2361
02:38:48,160 --> 02:38:53,360
we were going out and she was turning into Jesus Freak that she is now. Um, so before

2362
02:38:53,360 --> 02:38:57,300
that I was talking with this one girl who used to, you know, she was really had like

2363
02:38:57,300 --> 02:39:01,060
a crush thing on me all throughout high school and I just kind of ignored it. I didn't really

2364
02:39:01,060 --> 02:39:15,060
I don't care, but we were talking and stuff, and she wanted to go out to this club, but it was late at night, and she had no one to drive her, so I was like, oh, I'll take you down there, because I've never been there, and it sounded like fun, it sounded different, so we went to Goth Night down at the Rage.

2365
02:39:15,060 --> 02:39:33,060
So I get there, and there's like these really freaky people, okay? I mean, never have I seen so many drag queens and like people doing goth shit and stuff like that in my entire life, but it was fun because I like the music, I like industrial, and that kind of thing. They had K.M.F.D.M. and, you know, Rammstein, that kind of shit, so that was pretty cool.

2366
02:39:33,060 --> 02:39:56,060
This girl was really hot. She was nice. So we go there and I'm meeting all these weird people. There's this guy wearing a corset and she was commenting on his corset and asking her where he got it and that kind of thing.

2367
02:39:56,060 --> 02:40:23,060
But the really weird thing that happened to me that night is we were talking with her friend, one of her gay friends, I can't remember, I think his name was Thomas, yeah, gay friend Thomas, and now she was kind of, you know, hanging on me and stuff and all that kind of thing, and we were talking with him and stuff, and then her, his friend, also gay, was, you know, kind of eyeing me up and shit.

2368
02:40:23,060 --> 02:40:40,060
And so I was like, kind of, okay, what's going on here? And so there, you know, you're talking, and then I guess Thomas goes and talks to his friend, and comes back, he's like, my friend has made an interesting proposition, and I think he'd like to hear it. I'm like, okay.

2369
02:40:40,060 --> 02:40:44,060
Um, he wants to know if you'd be willing to go home with him tonight.

2370
02:40:44,060 --> 02:40:49,060
I'm like, hell no! No, wait! Sorry, don't swing that way.

2371
02:40:49,060 --> 02:40:53,060
And he's all, no, really, it's, uh, then, you know, Thomas is like, no, really, it's good.

2372
02:40:53,060 --> 02:40:58,060
You know, I've done it before. I'm like, no. And no, no.

2373
02:40:58,060 --> 02:41:01,060
So basically, she was, like, acting like my pimp that night.

2374
02:41:01,060 --> 02:41:03,060
I don't know. It was kind of weird.

2375
02:41:03,060 --> 02:41:05,060
It was kind of cool, though, because she was hanging out with me and she's, you know,

2376
02:41:05,060 --> 02:41:14,360
She was an exotic dancer once, and it was really sweet because she had piercings in

2377
02:41:14,360 --> 02:41:17,200
all the right places, except she wouldn't pierce the boys.

2378
02:41:17,200 --> 02:41:20,780
She didn't want to pierce her nipples, but she had piercings in other places.

2379
02:41:20,780 --> 02:41:23,200
I kept trying to get her to show me her piercings, but she wouldn't.

2380
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:24,200
She was kind of shy.

2381
02:41:24,200 --> 02:41:26,200
She also had pictures, too.

2382
02:41:26,200 --> 02:41:28,460
Is she shy?

2383
02:41:28,460 --> 02:41:29,460
I know.

2384
02:41:29,460 --> 02:41:30,460
I know.

2385
02:41:30,460 --> 02:41:39,460
She's also taking pictures with her just wearing caution tape, and then the caution tape being heated up a little bit so that it's form-fitting.

2386
02:41:39,460 --> 02:41:43,460
I wanted to see that. That was kind of cool, but no.

2387
02:41:43,460 --> 02:41:46,460
Let's see, other than that...

2388
02:41:46,460 --> 02:41:51,460
Oh, this story kind of sucks. I had something really last night that was funny, and this is why we were going through the whole segment.

2389
02:41:51,460 --> 02:41:57,460
But unfortunately, I didn't record what I wanted to actually talk about today.

2390
02:41:57,460 --> 02:42:02,460
Let's see here. I can do the strip club story.

2391
02:42:02,460 --> 02:42:07,460
Okay.

2392
02:42:07,460 --> 02:42:12,460
Alright, well, real quick strip club story. Now there's some strippers that really kind of scare me.

2393
02:42:12,460 --> 02:42:17,460
There's this one chick, you know, she comes up, I'm at the bar there,

2394
02:42:17,460 --> 02:42:22,460
you've got my dollar bills down shit, she comes to rub her tits in my face, and that's kind of cool.

2395
02:42:22,460 --> 02:42:23,400
capital

2396
02:42:23,400 --> 02:42:26,600
but when she does it though it's like

2397
02:42:26,600 --> 02:42:30,100
that's good shit i mean i was like i wasn't prepared for that she had a

2398
02:42:30,100 --> 02:42:32,340
well what the fuck you see with

2399
02:42:32,340 --> 02:42:36,600
is with most annoying high-pitched voice that you can ever imagine

2400
02:42:36,600 --> 02:42:37,600
it was

2401
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:38,500
the

2402
02:42:38,500 --> 02:42:43,500
sound of the world

2403
02:42:43,500 --> 02:42:48,500
the

2404
02:42:48,500 --> 02:42:53,420
Anyways, so yeah, that was scary.

2405
02:42:53,420 --> 02:42:59,600
We're going to be doing another strip-flip trip, though, pretty soon, though, because my friend's getting married, and I know he's going to be throwing a bachelor party, plus next week we're talking about going...

2406
02:42:59,600 --> 02:43:01,220
My girlfriend's going to strip-flip!

2407
02:43:01,220 --> 02:43:04,280
She's going to strip-flip at the end of the month with her friends, and supposedly

2408
02:43:04,280 --> 02:43:06,020
at Centerfolds,

2409
02:43:06,020 --> 02:43:07,620
I guess they do

2410
02:43:07,620 --> 02:43:09,780
full-nude strip-flips, or

2411
02:43:09,780 --> 02:43:11,620
guy-stripping, full-nude.

2412
02:43:11,620 --> 02:43:13,260
I never knew that.

2413
02:43:13,260 --> 02:43:17,140
I'm there. You gotta get tickets in advance, though, so it's eight dollars to go in.

2414
02:43:17,140 --> 02:43:26,140
But she's going with her friend and a couple of her friends, and they're going to do that, and they're going to buy each other lap dances. So that's kind of cool.

2415
02:43:26,140 --> 02:43:30,140
But I want to definitely hit up the strip club again, because it's fun.

2416
02:43:30,140 --> 02:43:37,140
Yeah, centerfolds, they have actually, Gold Club centerfolds, they've got their own actual forums. It's kind of funny watching people post in there.

2417
02:43:37,140 --> 02:43:42,140
I went to the Gold Club centerfold forums the other day. I don't remember why. I was talking to a friend online about them.

2418
02:43:42,140 --> 02:43:46,140
And um, yeah, they were interesting stuff. That's all.

2419
02:44:12,140 --> 02:44:16,420
you know, it'll cost you half as much in each, you know, to go in there. So, okay, yeah,

2420
02:44:16,420 --> 02:44:21,540
we'll do that. So, we go in there and basically the shower room is like this kind of large

2421
02:44:21,540 --> 02:44:25,640
communal shower thing. They've got these two chicks, you know, totally naked in there.

2422
02:44:25,640 --> 02:44:30,100
And they've got their sprayed whipped cream or not, yeah, like shaving cream all over

2423
02:44:30,100 --> 02:44:34,380
their bodies. Well, the shower room, what you can do is you can put dollar bills in

2424
02:44:34,380 --> 02:44:38,700
your hand and you can basically touch them all over their body wherever you want. Well,

2425
02:44:38,700 --> 02:44:43,700
And so as long as you have a dollar bill in your hand, you can keep putting dollars on them and stuff.

2426
02:44:43,700 --> 02:44:48,700
And then they started getting a little bit more freakier, and then they started going down on each other and shit in there.

2427
02:44:48,700 --> 02:44:53,700
I mean, I didn't know this kind of stuff happened in strip clubs, but I guess it does.

2428
02:44:53,700 --> 02:44:57,700
And then they had, um, if you paid $20, they would sit on your face.

2429
02:44:57,700 --> 02:44:58,700
But you just had to-

2430
02:44:58,700 --> 02:45:09,700
But you just have to keep your mouth shut.

2431
02:45:09,700 --> 02:45:16,700
So I guess it looks for the people with really big noses.

2432
02:45:16,700 --> 02:45:19,700
Look, I'm going there!

2433
02:45:19,700 --> 02:45:35,700
So, yeah, it was very interesting. The only thing I regret is because it was such a large group, I couldn't really get to the front of the line to, like, you know, be able to put dollar bills on, you know, Naked Chick's breast, but it was fun while it lasted. I mean, I don't know, it was interesting.

2434
02:45:35,700 --> 02:45:43,700
You know, I'm getting in so much trouble for this because the last time that I talked about weird shit like this, my girlfriend was bored and decided to listen to this show.

2435
02:45:43,700 --> 02:45:52,840
I love you, you're listening. Yeah, she does all this weird shit that we've done. I mean,

2436
02:45:52,840 --> 02:45:57,140
Lisa, I'm not like my friends who go and get, you know, the VIP room dances and get head

2437
02:45:57,140 --> 02:46:01,720
in there. I mean, so, and this, okay, if for all the people that are visiting Rancho Cordova,

2438
02:46:01,720 --> 02:46:08,560
this is Gold Club Centerfolds off of Folsom Boulevard. Do check it out. Yeah, that's all.

2439
02:46:08,560 --> 02:46:11,560
That's my story.

2440
02:46:11,560 --> 02:46:13,720
I like cheese.

2441
02:46:13,720 --> 02:46:18,080
Irene's playing Animal Crossing.

2442
02:46:18,080 --> 02:46:28,380
I'm going to have to do some more interesting weird shit in order to come up with stories, or start digging back into my past, because I've done a lot of awkward, weird shit before, and I'm sure, you know, they'll come up.

2443
02:46:28,380 --> 02:46:33,320
Well, you know what? For next week, that's your homework. You know, go find a funny story in your life and write it down.

2444
02:46:33,320 --> 02:46:38,320
I'm going to start a Paypal account. It's Loki's go to strip club fun account.

2445
02:46:38,320 --> 02:46:41,320
You never know, it might work.

2446
02:46:41,320 --> 02:46:44,320
Jamie, you want to announce the winner of this week's cage match?

2447
02:46:44,320 --> 02:46:47,320
Um, here's a quarter, Matt.

2448
02:46:47,320 --> 02:46:52,320
Woohoo! First donation to your strip club needs.

2449
02:46:52,320 --> 02:46:54,320
Oh, here we go!

2450
02:46:54,320 --> 02:46:55,320
Okay.

2451
02:46:55,320 --> 02:46:57,320
And, guess what?

2452
02:46:57,320 --> 02:46:59,320
Fuck everybody because I win.

2453
02:46:59,320 --> 02:47:02,320
That's because everyone's whipped to Jamie.

2454
02:47:02,320 --> 02:47:04,320
Just cause you all love me.

2455
02:47:04,320 --> 02:47:08,320
Yeah, it's probably all the people that listen to her F.U. shows all the time.

2456
02:47:08,320 --> 02:47:10,320
You're all nerds like me.

2457
02:47:10,320 --> 02:47:12,320
And the winner is me!

2458
02:47:12,320 --> 02:47:15,320
Oh, I'm sorry, Aphex Twin, and Eat'em Up.

2459
02:47:15,320 --> 02:47:18,320
Yeah, cause I'm cool.

2460
02:47:18,320 --> 02:47:21,320
Bless all of you people who are old school like me.

2461
02:47:21,320 --> 02:47:23,320
Not much to say, Jamie.

2462
02:47:23,320 --> 02:47:25,320
I'm gonna kick you again.

2463
02:47:25,320 --> 02:47:27,320
I'm gonna kick you again.

2464
02:47:27,320 --> 02:47:31,320
No, she's got my dog! Give it back! Give it back! No!

2465
02:47:31,320 --> 02:47:36,220
I just ate a little dog with the microphone don't do that again

2466
02:47:36,840 --> 02:47:38,840
Wipe it off on Rob

2467
02:47:39,520 --> 02:47:42,860
Okay, we're gonna take really quick break like one or two song break

2468
02:47:42,860 --> 02:47:47,720
We're gonna come back to wrap up this big train wreck of a show so stay with us. Won't you won't you be my neighbor?

2469
02:47:49,200 --> 02:47:51,200
And we'll be back

2470
02:47:55,360 --> 02:47:58,680
Let's do I want to play something we play one of mine, yes

2471
02:47:58,680 --> 02:48:00,680
I'll start with this song and then we'll do one of yours, okay?

2472
02:48:00,680 --> 02:48:01,180
Okay.

2473
02:48:01,180 --> 02:48:08,180
back

2474
02:49:01,180 --> 02:49:24,180
I can't wait to see you in the next video!

2475
02:49:24,180 --> 02:49:27,420
Loki's going to introduce this next song for us because it's special.

2476
02:49:27,420 --> 02:49:28,420
Okay.

2477
02:49:28,420 --> 02:49:29,420
Special ed.

2478
02:49:29,420 --> 02:49:33,300
for every for all those people out there that are thinking

2479
02:49:33,300 --> 02:49:36,060
it would be a really great idea to mix max three hundred with

2480
02:49:36,060 --> 02:49:40,180
name of baumanni song or any song that's in the whole baumanni series

2481
02:49:40,180 --> 02:49:44,100
um... here's why you shouldn't do that

2482
02:49:44,100 --> 02:49:51,100
Is this going to sound like a... never mind, I'm not going to say it on air.

2483
02:50:44,100 --> 02:50:57,020
Enos,

2484
02:50:57,720 --> 02:50:59,160
Blackfeet, Pogo.

2485
02:50:59,160 --> 02:51:28,240
Let's listen in on an

2486
02:51:28,240 --> 02:51:35,240
Orange Lounge Radio Staff Meeting

2487
02:51:45,400 --> 02:51:47,600
Extreme Bamani Radio

2488
02:51:47,600 --> 02:51:50,600
That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

2489
02:51:50,600 --> 02:51:52,600
Dot, dot, dot.

2490
02:51:53,600 --> 02:51:56,600
Jamie's twitching. She went into a coma. That song killed her.

2491
02:51:58,600 --> 02:52:02,600
Let's just say that song fucking sucks.

2492
02:52:02,600 --> 02:52:04,600
We're gonna remix this because they have some lessons a little bit.

2493
02:52:04,600 --> 02:52:05,600
I'm having a...

2494
02:52:05,600 --> 02:52:06,600
I could just remix better than that.

2495
02:52:06,600 --> 02:52:08,600
I have had a cry.

2496
02:52:08,600 --> 02:52:11,600
How much of this life is worse than Max Dinosaur?

2497
02:52:11,600 --> 02:52:12,600
Oh god, I heard that.

2498
02:52:12,600 --> 02:52:15,600
It sounded. It sounded.

2499
02:52:15,600 --> 02:52:17,600
You know what it sounded like?

2500
02:52:17,600 --> 02:52:18,600
Burning?

2501
02:52:18,600 --> 02:52:19,600
A twin mix.

2502
02:52:19,600 --> 02:52:22,600
Well, actually, later on, uh...

2503
02:52:22,600 --> 02:52:23,600
Sing for that one!

2504
02:52:23,600 --> 02:52:25,600
I've got something else that you guys might like.

2505
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:28,600
Well, anyways, that was a light entry in Turning Mix 3.

2506
02:52:28,600 --> 02:52:31,600
This is all the shit that was cluttering up, you know, the song list

2507
02:52:31,600 --> 02:52:34,600
that the reason my entry didn't get played.

2508
02:52:34,600 --> 02:52:38,600
I should have put my entry as the name of the game, Max300,

2509
02:52:38,600 --> 02:52:40,600
and it'd be like, oh, Max300, I'm gonna play that.

2510
02:52:40,600 --> 02:52:41,600
You know, so...

2511
02:52:41,600 --> 02:52:42,600
Frickin' A.

2512
02:52:42,600 --> 02:52:43,600
Okay.

2513
02:52:43,600 --> 02:52:44,600
Oh.

2514
02:52:44,600 --> 02:52:47,280
Okay, let me call numbers.

2515
02:52:47,280 --> 02:52:52,200
But yeah, there's a bunch of horrible shit out there.

2516
02:52:52,200 --> 02:52:54,440
Helium Era is a good example.

2517
02:52:54,440 --> 02:53:00,720
I've got another one that's Max 300, the Positive Reversal, some remix.

2518
02:53:00,720 --> 02:53:02,480
It's Max 300 backwards.

2519
02:53:02,480 --> 02:53:03,480
It's really shitty.

2520
02:53:03,480 --> 02:53:07,560
And then there's another one that's, we might be playing later, Max Doctor?

2521
02:53:07,560 --> 02:53:08,560
No.

2522
02:53:08,560 --> 02:53:09,560
Oh, what the hell?

2523
02:53:09,560 --> 02:53:10,560
Hell no.

2524
02:53:10,560 --> 02:53:11,560
Hell no.

2525
02:53:11,560 --> 02:53:12,560
Hell no.

2526
02:53:12,560 --> 02:53:16,560
I'm gonna read it into the lounge soon.

2527
02:53:16,560 --> 02:53:21,560
But, um, yeah, well, hmm. I've got some more stuff, though.

2528
02:53:21,560 --> 02:53:23,560
Plenty of horrible sound files.

2529
02:53:23,560 --> 02:53:26,560
That was very homoerotic, though, that song.

2530
02:53:26,560 --> 02:53:30,560
I would like to state, uh, Politary, I believe, has been banned from Orange Islands for a little while.

2531
02:53:30,560 --> 02:53:36,560
Although, we, her good songs, we accept, we let them through, like, you know, uh, memories, memories and, uh, you know, me.

2532
02:53:36,560 --> 02:53:37,560
That's pretty good.

2533
02:53:37,560 --> 02:53:41,560
We let those, we let those through. I don't know, there was another one that we let through, I thought it was that one.

2534
02:53:41,560 --> 02:53:45,560
Anyway, but that song? That song's banned for ten years, from Orange Islands Radio.

2535
02:53:45,560 --> 02:53:49,560
Let's just ban all Max 300, anything with Max 300 in it.

2536
02:53:49,560 --> 02:53:55,560
Okay, anything that is not Konami produced with Max in the title is now banned from this station.

2537
02:53:55,560 --> 02:53:56,560
Word.

2538
02:53:56,560 --> 02:54:04,560
No, any Max that sucks, because there's some pretty good Max files, but Max dinosaur, Max, whatever that title is.

2539
02:54:04,560 --> 02:54:11,560
Actually, there's been, okay, I've seen one really good, actually two very good mixes with Max in it.

2540
02:54:11,560 --> 02:54:21,200
in it. There was Max Resurrection, that was really good. It's on Simply Retarded, it's

2541
02:54:21,200 --> 02:54:26,560
on their site. But then there's also one that was Dropout 300, that was really good.

2542
02:54:26,560 --> 02:54:30,200
I thought of another one that's actually okay, Piano Max Unlimited, that was cool.

2543
02:54:30,200 --> 02:54:39,960
Oh yeah, that right there was STM, he was the guy that actually, a long time ago. Now

2544
02:54:39,960 --> 02:54:46,480
Now if you remember, now they have that musician's trial thing right now for 2DX9 style or whatever.

2545
02:54:46,480 --> 02:54:51,680
They did a similar thing back in the day for 4th style, and they also did it for 5th mix.

2546
02:54:51,680 --> 02:54:55,200
5th mix, the winner of it was Paranoid Eternal, and that was done by E.M.

2547
02:54:55,200 --> 02:54:59,680
STM did another, he has a bunch of music files he's done.

2548
02:54:59,680 --> 02:55:06,040
In fact, Virtu Corey released, what was it, there was a Trip Machine strange mix that

2549
02:55:06,040 --> 02:55:10,040
It was floating around in the net and people thought it was Trip Machine Survivor.

2550
02:55:10,040 --> 02:55:12,040
That was hilarious.

2551
02:55:12,040 --> 02:55:18,040
So that was going around, but that was actually a remix done by that guy, STM.

2552
02:55:18,040 --> 02:55:24,040
And he actually, you know, he was one of the lucky ones that actually got an actual song in DDR.

2553
02:55:24,040 --> 02:55:29,040
Yeah, it's in Xtreme now, so go play his remix and it's actually pretty good.

2554
02:55:29,040 --> 02:55:31,040
What's your favorite part of the song?

2555
02:55:59,040 --> 02:56:03,520
Next week worst like the cage worst or something. I don't know

2556
02:56:04,560 --> 02:56:11,040
We should do one. We should do one. We're like only one song. You know survives and the rest get dumped off the playlist

2557
02:56:11,840 --> 02:56:13,800
All right

2558
02:56:13,800 --> 02:56:18,320
What we could do is like we'll have like a turn it like a cage match tournament of all the worst songs

2559
02:56:18,520 --> 02:56:23,560
And all the ones that get that and all the songs except for the winner will get put under a CD

2560
02:56:23,560 --> 02:56:33,560
I know it would win the losing. Let them move.

2561
02:56:33,560 --> 02:56:36,560
No, no, no. Oh, what do you mean, win the losing?

2562
02:56:36,560 --> 02:56:39,560
Max for you. Max for you.

2563
02:56:39,560 --> 02:57:00,560
There's a bunch of Omani remixes out there that are official on DanceMania. There's one I've got on my CD here, it's Candy the Planet Remix.

2564
02:57:00,560 --> 02:57:10,560
The one that's out right now for people who are playing in DDR Extreme, there's Burning The Floor and MomoMix.

2565
02:57:30,560 --> 02:57:36,560
I've got a Let Them Move remix on that CD that's really, really bad.

2566
02:57:36,560 --> 02:57:40,560
Imagine Let Them Move and Max 300 mixed together.

2567
02:57:40,560 --> 02:57:42,560
It's been done.

2568
02:57:42,560 --> 02:57:45,560
There's this guy, Twin, who used to be in our chat room.

2569
02:57:45,560 --> 02:57:48,560
He used to do Let Them Move remixes all the time.

2570
02:57:48,560 --> 02:57:49,560
Final thought, Dave?

2571
02:57:49,560 --> 02:57:50,560
Final thought?

2572
02:57:50,560 --> 02:57:52,560
Final thought.

2573
02:57:52,560 --> 02:57:54,560
I need to play DDR Extreme.

2574
02:57:54,560 --> 02:57:56,560
And I will pass V.

2575
02:57:56,560 --> 02:58:03,560
or not at Roosevelt-Goughland.

2576
02:58:26,560 --> 02:58:28,560
They'd be going to the bathroom so badly.

2577
02:58:30,060 --> 02:58:33,060
Well, that's like one of the worst songs ever, how can I think of?

2578
02:58:35,560 --> 02:58:37,560
Or just get some damn lessons, or something.

2579
02:58:38,060 --> 02:58:40,060
And end up with a waksa wakla, or...

2580
02:58:41,060 --> 02:58:45,060
Max for you, or whatever the damn thing people are talking about on the internet.

2581
02:58:46,560 --> 02:58:49,560
Unless if it's very good, you can give it to me and I'll see, I'll rate it.

2582
02:58:52,060 --> 02:58:55,560
And Scania should get New York Streams soon.

2583
02:58:55,560 --> 02:58:59,560
It's on its way, and I can't wait till it comes.

2584
02:58:59,560 --> 02:59:02,560
Alright, Black Lab, final thought.

2585
02:59:02,560 --> 02:59:05,560
Derby Owners Club is my new crack.

2586
02:59:05,560 --> 02:59:10,560
I have to go play it next time I go back to the Bay Area, which hopefully will be soon.

2587
02:59:10,560 --> 02:59:14,560
But now I gotta get a job so I can blow money on DOC. I'm sad.

2588
02:59:14,560 --> 02:59:16,560
You could blow so you can blow.

2589
02:59:16,560 --> 02:59:18,560
No!

2590
02:59:18,560 --> 02:59:21,560
I... Don't bring that up again!

2591
02:59:21,560 --> 02:59:23,560
Again?

2592
02:59:23,560 --> 02:59:25,560
Brad, final thought?

2593
02:59:25,560 --> 02:59:27,560
All your fried chicken are blowing to me.

2594
02:59:27,560 --> 02:59:29,560
Does Irene have a final thought?

2595
02:59:29,560 --> 02:59:31,560
Are you allergic to corn?

2596
02:59:31,560 --> 02:59:33,560
It's fine, I only had a little.

2597
02:59:33,560 --> 02:59:35,560
I want another one.

2598
02:59:35,560 --> 02:59:37,560
Wait a minute! If you're allergic to corn, why eat anymore?

2599
02:59:37,560 --> 02:59:39,560
I won't die.

2600
02:59:39,560 --> 02:59:41,560
Um, let's see...

2601
02:59:41,560 --> 02:59:43,560
Loki, your final thought of the day?

2602
02:59:45,560 --> 02:59:47,560
My furrow hurts from all this yelling and screaming.

2603
02:59:47,560 --> 02:59:49,560
I can't be enthusiastic and stuff.

2604
02:59:49,560 --> 02:59:51,560
Especially with this stupid science thing.

2605
02:59:51,560 --> 02:59:53,560
I'm not being so hateful.

2606
02:59:54,560 --> 02:59:56,560
Why? I hate the world!

2607
02:59:56,560 --> 02:59:57,560
Let go of your hate.

2608
02:59:57,560 --> 03:00:02,560
You know, if people would stop being stupid and start dying, the world would be a better place.

2609
03:00:02,560 --> 03:00:05,560
I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.

2610
03:00:06,560 --> 03:00:10,560
You know, that's one of the reasons I don't get drunk is because I'm not afraid I'm going to get violent.

2611
03:00:10,560 --> 03:00:16,560
I mean, what if the actual inhibitions I have is from killing people and then that goes away?

2612
03:00:16,560 --> 03:00:20,560
Then I would wake up out of a drunken stupor and see a bunch of bodies and blood everywhere.

2613
03:00:20,560 --> 03:00:21,560
Wouldn't that be frightening?

2614
03:00:21,560 --> 03:00:23,560
I just hug people.

2615
03:00:23,560 --> 03:00:25,560
I turn into the absolute opposite when I'm drunk.

2616
03:00:25,560 --> 03:00:29,560
Instead of being all angsty and violent and everything, I can start loving everybody and

2617
03:00:29,560 --> 03:00:31,560
wanting to hug everybody I see.

2618
03:00:31,560 --> 03:00:32,560
Have you noticed that?

2619
03:00:32,560 --> 03:00:38,660
And DDR-Llama, or if anyone has contacts with DDR-Llama right now, please set up my uploading

2620
03:00:38,660 --> 03:00:42,560
script because I'm waiting on you to finish it and you said you'd do it like three days

2621
03:00:42,560 --> 03:00:47,560
ago and you haven't and it's really frustrating because I need to upload my site and get it

2622
03:00:47,560 --> 03:00:48,560
done!

2623
03:00:48,560 --> 03:00:49,560
Were you whining?

2624
03:00:49,560 --> 03:00:50,560
NO!

2625
03:00:50,560 --> 03:00:51,560
Anyways, I'm dead.

2626
03:00:51,560 --> 03:00:52,560
Go!

2627
03:00:52,560 --> 03:01:00,040
I get to be last.

2628
03:01:00,040 --> 03:01:06,860
My final thought of the day is, um, uh, yeah, we're running long and I'm not helping because

2629
03:01:06,860 --> 03:01:14,860
I can't think of a final thought, um, oh, my final thought, um, as the old cheerleaders,

2630
03:01:14,860 --> 03:01:21,860
the old cheerleaders from Saturday Night Live said, sex can wait, masturbate.

2631
03:01:21,860 --> 03:01:27,060
My final thought of the day is I'm going to have Boba and you have to stay tuned for the

2632
03:01:27,060 --> 03:01:32,060
after birth. Alright, bye guys. Bye.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!

2641
03:02:30,560 --> 03:02:33,560
Splinter taught them to be ninja teens!

2642
03:02:33,560 --> 03:02:35,560
He's a radical rat!

2643
03:02:35,560 --> 03:02:38,560
Leonardo leads Donatello's dust machine!

2644
03:02:38,560 --> 03:02:40,560
That's a rat, Jack!

2645
03:02:40,560 --> 03:02:42,560
Raphael is cool, but rude!

2646
03:02:42,560 --> 03:02:43,560
Give me a break!

2647
03:02:43,560 --> 03:02:45,560
Michelangelo is a party dude!

2648
03:02:45,560 --> 03:02:46,560
Pardon!

2649
03:02:46,560 --> 03:02:48,560
