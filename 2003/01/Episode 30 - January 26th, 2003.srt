1
00:00:02,416 --> 00:00:03,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Message for you, son!

2
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:04,419
[SPEAKER_16]: Attention!

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,505
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

4
00:00:11,107 --> 00:00:16,154
[SPEAKER_31]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, Mamani Talk, and then some.

5
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:22,707
[SPEAKER_31]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

6
00:00:23,027 --> 00:00:26,209
[SPEAKER_31]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,512
[SPEAKER_31]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

8
00:00:30,032 --> 00:00:32,934
[SPEAKER_31]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

9
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:34,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

10
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:35,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

11
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:43,601
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode... Hey, any balls down there?

12
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:46,343
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the biggest berry I've ever seen, Jingleberry.

13
00:00:46,403 --> 00:00:48,444
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your favorite scary movie?

14
00:00:49,577 --> 00:00:50,157
[SPEAKER_12]: Showgirls.

15
00:00:51,038 --> 00:00:52,258
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely frightful.

16
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:53,239
[SPEAKER_12]: What's yours?

17
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:55,740
[SPEAKER_12]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't torture yourself.

19
00:00:57,681 --> 00:00:58,541
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my job.

20
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:00,442
[SPEAKER_27]: Now's the time our sprockets made me dogs!

21
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:03,603
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll get you, my pretty.

22
00:01:03,803 --> 00:01:05,144
[SPEAKER_14]: And your little dog, too.

23
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:06,444
[SPEAKER_12]: I know Kung Fu.

24
00:01:06,804 --> 00:01:09,225
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

25
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:11,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Why did they have to take the word gang?

26
00:01:12,927 --> 00:01:15,528
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody expects a Spanish exposition.

27
00:01:15,848 --> 00:01:16,669
[SPEAKER_16]: It's gender.

28
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:17,249
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey!

29
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,321
[SPEAKER_30]: DarkSakura, Shut up!

30
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:22,181
[SPEAKER_21]: Where's my gun?

31
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:24,643
[SPEAKER_21]: This is my boomstick!

32
00:01:24,723 --> 00:01:27,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Sky, Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

33
00:01:27,564 --> 00:01:31,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

34
00:01:31,346 --> 00:01:34,107
[SPEAKER_16]: What kind of warped human being would find that funny?

35
00:01:34,388 --> 00:01:45,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio We are live and this is episode number 30 for January 9th, I'm sorry, January the 26th of 2003.

36
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:52,243
[SPEAKER_02]: You're tuned into the Bimani Scene's most apocalyptic radio station of all things Bimani.

37
00:01:52,964 --> 00:01:54,786
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts, or you might know me as Sky.

38
00:01:55,647 --> 00:01:59,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

39
00:02:01,473 --> 00:02:03,095
[SPEAKER_02]: You know her better as DarkSakura.

40
00:02:04,056 --> 00:02:05,958
[SPEAKER_02]: She does not sound very enjoyed today, I'm sorry.

41
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:06,638
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'm okay.

42
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:08,781
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, we're having some... And you bring...

43
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:11,042
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a mixing board for this damn show.

44
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:42,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, anyway, also in the house, say hello to our tech master Loki.

45
00:02:42,842 --> 00:02:43,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey everybody.

46
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:44,723
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

47
00:02:46,684 --> 00:02:47,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing good.

48
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:54,509
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have special guests in the studio tonight, except they're all in the other room, so fuck them.

49
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:55,569
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't exist to me.

50
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, here they come.

51
00:02:58,231 --> 00:02:58,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Here I come.

52
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:00,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he just say he sucks on the dick soar?

53
00:03:02,073 --> 00:03:02,974
[SPEAKER_34]: Hello dick suck soar.

54
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:05,253
[SPEAKER_34]: Who are the Dick Suck Swords?

55
00:03:05,614 --> 00:03:07,155
[SPEAKER_03]: It would not be nice to have a sword here.

56
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,297
[SPEAKER_34]: Introduce yourselves for the listening audience, please.

57
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:12,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Why, I hear everything.

58
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:16,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you damn slacker.

59
00:03:16,342 --> 00:03:19,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thanks, I was going to do it.

60
00:03:19,685 --> 00:03:22,847

63
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:04,428
[SPEAKER_02]: To start off tonight, we're going to play a little song that's really popular in DDR Extreme.

64
00:04:04,488 --> 00:04:07,131
[SPEAKER_02]: It came over from Poppin' Music, and all you kids love it.

65
00:04:07,171 --> 00:04:09,274
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Daiken Kai.

66
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:10,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

67
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:10,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

I'm giving all my heart to you, my love I justify my love for you I'm giving you my heart, my soul, my love I justify my love for you I justify my love for you

74
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:46,109
[SPEAKER_32]: And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.

75
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:48,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Do it all night, do it with me.

76
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,391
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible.

77
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:52,792
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you take vocal lessons?

78
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:53,832
[SPEAKER_17]: Kill your teacher.

79
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:55,353
[SPEAKER_17]: In the heat of the night.

80
00:08:55,813 --> 00:08:58,034
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.

81
00:08:59,214 --> 00:08:59,895
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it.

82
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,956
[SPEAKER_17]: Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.

83
00:09:02,056 --> 00:09:02,496
[SPEAKER_17]: Next.

84
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:06,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, that was cool.

85
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:10,021
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you even know why you're here?

86
00:09:10,121 --> 00:09:12,305
[SPEAKER_17]: That was just bloody pathetic, next!

87
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:17,891
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes!

88
00:09:18,311 --> 00:09:18,951
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, that's it!

89
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,492
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a winner!

90
00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:25,653
[SPEAKER_32]: A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

91
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:29,914
[SPEAKER_02]: A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio, because I say that every week.

92
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:33,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, yes, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

93
00:09:33,775 --> 00:09:35,115
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're having the humming issue tonight.

94
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:35,935
[SPEAKER_02]: We apologize.

95
00:09:35,995 --> 00:09:37,136
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not much we can do about it.

96
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:41,597
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're actually going to try to do is kind of turn down our volumes and kill our in-studio noise.

97
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,997
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys will have to talk really loud into the mics tonight.

98
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:44,978
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay!

99
00:09:45,238 --> 00:09:45,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like that.

100
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:46,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

101
00:09:47,762 --> 00:09:48,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear us?

102
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:50,764
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi!

103
00:09:51,144 --> 00:09:54,746
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we apologize for the humming, but my computer just sucks.

104
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:56,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they like it when you hum.

105
00:09:58,809 --> 00:09:59,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, yes.

106
00:10:03,231 --> 00:10:08,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I dusted off that erotic promo because American Idol 2 premiered this week.

107
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:13,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anybody out there gives a shit about American Idol anymore, but I watched it.

108
00:10:13,397 --> 00:10:14,578
[SPEAKER_21]: American Idol makes me shit.

109
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:20,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate Irene, by the way, ladies and gentlemen.

110
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:34,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

111
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:36,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a virgin?

112
00:10:36,204 --> 00:10:37,505
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you are a virgin.

113
00:10:37,965 --> 00:10:41,907
[SPEAKER_03]: No one is going to touch you with a 10-foot pole.

114
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:42,567
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

115
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:51,071
[SPEAKER_03]: My God, it's like, let's get some cracked-out baby, raise him up to be a pop idol, and put him on the show.

116
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:51,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, no, he's stupid.

117
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:57,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this American Idol 2 show because I like crap.

118
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:06,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's just, there's a lot of really, I don't know, I think I'm sick or something because I love watching Simon tear into these people who can't sing.

119
00:11:06,643 --> 00:11:07,023
[SPEAKER_02]: You like crap.

120
00:11:07,043 --> 00:11:07,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I can.

121
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:08,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I just drink a big crap in the toilet.

122
00:11:09,244 --> 00:11:09,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

123
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:10,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for sharing.

124
00:11:11,824 --> 00:11:20,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, Channel Pound Orange Lounge is requesting, our chat room, by the way, if you want to join our website, orangelounge.skie.cx, they're requesting a Hummer.

125
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:22,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.

126
00:11:26,912 --> 00:11:28,993
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what we used to do, which is quite funny?

127
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:37,358
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had this giant, giant subwoofer at Qzar, and people used to sit on it, and then we used to yell into the mic.

128
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:39,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Women liked it, I don't know.

129
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,621
[SPEAKER_03]: That was done on the Howard Stern movie.

130
00:11:43,842 --> 00:11:45,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, been there, done that high.

131
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:47,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, oh yeah, we were looking at the rating books.

132
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:48,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn you!

133
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:51,684
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

134
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:18,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna give it another one, so fuck it

135
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,183
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to start off tonight's show with a listless segment, because we usually do it at the end of the show.

136
00:12:37,203 --> 00:12:47,352
[SPEAKER_02]: But tonight we're going to do it at the beginning of the show, because we want to talk about something that's going on right now, right this very minute, that is preventing our usual amounts of listeners from turning out in droves.

137
00:12:48,113 --> 00:12:49,013
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on, Jamie?

138
00:12:50,495 --> 00:12:53,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than you about ready to get whopped with this microphone.

139
00:12:53,597 --> 00:12:57,420
[SPEAKER_22]: The fucking stupid bull.

140
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,541
[SPEAKER_03]: What's actually happening is...

141
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:03,379
[SPEAKER_20]: They're sucking more ass than they've ever sucked in their life.

142
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:09,141
[SPEAKER_03]: The raiders are bending over while... While the securers make the choosers, finally.

143
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,341
[SPEAKER_21]: In their rectal cavity.

144
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:12,141
[SPEAKER_21]: And pirate.

145
00:13:15,442 --> 00:13:16,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Y'all just jealous.

146
00:13:17,842 --> 00:13:19,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could lose by 30 points!

147
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:20,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo!

148
00:13:20,723 --> 00:13:25,604
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry, but at this point, the collective asshole of the raiders is the cavernous.

149
00:13:26,384 --> 00:13:28,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I should go check out the score, because maybe things turned around.

150
00:13:28,644 --> 00:13:29,365
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny?

151
00:13:29,385 --> 00:13:30,485
[SPEAKER_22]: What, by two points, maybe?

152
00:13:32,565 --> 00:13:36,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if there's going to be rioting in San Diego tonight when the Raiders lose really badly.

153
00:13:36,486 --> 00:13:42,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, like, I don't know if you guys heard, but the whole town of San Diego was kind of bracing themselves for Raiders fans.

154
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:45,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Because San Diego is only about an eight-hour drive from Oakland.

155
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:48,870
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, a lot of those insane people that like to burn things are going to drive down there.

156
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,751
[SPEAKER_22]: So... We're going to be hearing all kinds of... Oh, man.

157
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:54,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to see that.

158
00:13:54,472 --> 00:13:55,312
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, riot goodness.

159
00:13:55,672 --> 00:13:58,073
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to blame it on Al-Qaeda.

160
00:13:58,893 --> 00:14:00,694
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not Oakland, it's not San Diego.

161
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:01,774
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Al-Qaeda.

162
00:14:02,094 --> 00:14:03,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Al-Qaeda wanted the Raiders to win.

163
00:14:07,356 --> 00:14:09,176
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I still stand by my word for it.

164
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:10,117
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the stupid bowl.

165
00:14:10,137 --> 00:14:11,877
[SPEAKER_22]: Although the commercials are pretty funny.

166
00:14:12,938 --> 00:14:16,619
[SPEAKER_33]: Remember, America, if the Raiders lose, the terrorists win.

167
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,120
[SPEAKER_02]: See, this is what's going to happen.

168
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,601
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what's going to happen when the Raiders lose the Super Bowl.

169
00:14:26,224 --> 00:14:37,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was totally unnecessary.

170
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:40,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, oh yes, our list list, hi.

171
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,431
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be doing a list list tonight.

172
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:48,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Top three things, or top thing, because we have one thing.

173
00:14:48,673 --> 00:14:52,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Top things that we'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl.

174
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:04,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want you to stop.

175
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:08,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so tonight's list list.

176
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:13,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Top three things we'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl, except two of our guests just ran out of studio, so we can't even...

177
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:29,071
[SPEAKER_02]: The way a list list works, we all will read our top three choices, and then the fun part, we have to go around the room, and each person will remove one thing from that list.

178
00:15:29,872 --> 00:15:34,196
[SPEAKER_03]: They came up from 3 to 21 and 34, they're in the fourth quarter.

179
00:15:34,536 --> 00:15:35,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gods!

180
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:36,678
[SPEAKER_03]: They still have a chance.

181
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:37,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, whatever.

182
00:15:37,218 --> 00:15:38,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I know none of you care.

183
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

184
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

185
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:42,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody else got lazy.

186
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:43,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, yes, the topic.

187
00:15:44,282 --> 00:15:46,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Top three things we'd rather be doing than watch the Super Bowl.

188
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:54,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, and then the chat room, you guys will get to vote on what ends up being the ultimate list.

189
00:15:54,807 --> 00:15:56,928
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to vote, join our chat room now.

190
00:15:57,008 --> 00:16:02,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go to our webpage at orangelounge.skie.cx and...

191
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:15,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Brad's back there talking about... The best thing about the Super Bowl is all the cool commercials.

192
00:16:15,848 --> 00:16:20,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, since so many people are watching TV, they pay millions of dollars to put commercial spots.

193
00:16:21,187 --> 00:16:26,509
[SPEAKER_03]: They did, well, yeah, sometimes they air, you know, a little later, a little afterwards.

194
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:30,990
[SPEAKER_03]: But, anywho, they had the Matrix commercial in there for the two new Matrix movies coming out.

195
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty fucking cool, guys.

196
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:34,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited.

197
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:34,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wet.

198
00:16:34,831 --> 00:16:36,451
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they'll be, I'm sure they're already online.

199
00:16:36,611 --> 00:16:40,172
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I think somebody in our chat, I think EOSFVB already has a copy of them.

200
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm seeing that movie at least eight times when it comes out.

201
00:16:43,953 --> 00:16:48,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's one thing about the Matrix movies, I can see them over and over and over again, and I'm still entertained every time.

202
00:16:49,515 --> 00:16:51,275
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Jamie with Harry Potter.

203
00:16:51,715 --> 00:16:52,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

204
00:16:52,556 --> 00:16:55,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Except Harry Potter doesn't do fucking martial arts and shit.

205
00:16:55,436 --> 00:16:56,936
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.

206
00:16:57,036 --> 00:16:57,396
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.

207
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:58,777
[SPEAKER_22]: That would be cool.

208
00:17:00,217 --> 00:17:01,037
[SPEAKER_22]: Harry Potter!

209
00:17:02,257 --> 00:17:02,657
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, no.

210
00:17:02,697 --> 00:17:07,378
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you know it was on... I think it's the Smoking Gun or something.

211
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:16,580
[SPEAKER_22]: They had a drug bust of a shipment of ecstasy pills from... Yes, I did see that with Harry Potter's logo.

212
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,440
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, with the big HP on them.

213
00:17:19,827 --> 00:17:21,970
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyway, let's start.

214
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's read off our list.

215
00:17:23,712 --> 00:17:25,314
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start with Brad.

216
00:17:26,555 --> 00:17:28,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Number three thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl.

217
00:17:28,838 --> 00:17:30,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, because I know somebody else is already going to pick this.

218
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Playing 2DX.

219
00:17:31,822 --> 00:17:32,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Playing 2DX.

220
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:34,385
[SPEAKER_22]: Damn.

221
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:36,132
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

222
00:17:37,954 --> 00:17:40,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your number three thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl.

223
00:17:40,638 --> 00:17:45,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I really don't give a shit at all, I didn't even make a list, so I'm just going to pull random shit out of my head.

224
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:46,666
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, go for it.

225
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:48,849
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go with number three was shaving a monkey.

226
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Shaving a monkey.

227
00:17:54,892 --> 00:17:59,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan, the number three thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

228
00:17:59,134 --> 00:18:01,715
[SPEAKER_33]: Probably fixing my stupid fucking PS2.

229
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:05,116
[SPEAKER_33]: For all those of you out there who are considering Sony, consider again.

230
00:18:05,296 --> 00:18:05,696
[SPEAKER_33]: Please.

231
00:18:06,557 --> 00:18:08,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Fixing my stupid fucking PS2.

232
00:18:09,658 --> 00:18:10,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.

233
00:18:10,778 --> 00:18:16,181
[SPEAKER_02]: My number three thing, I also put playing 2DX, except I put playing 2DX at Scandia.

234
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:19,302
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll just change that to go to Scandia.

235
00:18:22,788 --> 00:18:49,394
[SPEAKER_22]: My number three thing Alright, yes, your number three thing, Jamie Is having the rest of my wisdom teeth pulled While I'm awake Having the rest of your wisdom teeth pulled while you're awake I'll be numb, but I refuse to be put to sleep Well, they have to be done anyway But I'm not going to let them put me to sleep I'm going to just tell them to numb the fuck out of my mouth And I don't want an IV Now, if I got an IV, okay, my hand would be blue Do I have a pocket?

236
00:18:49,414 --> 00:18:50,534
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I do have a pocket, I'm asleep

237
00:18:52,486 --> 00:18:52,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

238
00:18:53,207 --> 00:18:54,769
[SPEAKER_22]: Brad's amused by the pocket on my sleeve.

239
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:55,209
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

240
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,171
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, so good.

241
00:18:56,211 --> 00:18:58,433
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some beautiful choices here.

242
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:01,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Brad, number two thing you'd rather be doing than watch the Super Bowl.

243
00:19:02,098 --> 00:19:02,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Winning the lottery.

244
00:19:03,219 --> 00:19:04,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Winning the lottery.

245
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:09,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that goes without saying.

246
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:09,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

247
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,960
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather be winning the lottery than doing this show.

248
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, the number two thing you'd rather be doing than watching a Super Bowl.

249
00:19:18,161 --> 00:19:21,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this alludes to later on the show, but watching Ally McFeel.

250
00:19:26,344 --> 00:19:32,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Watching Ally McFeel, and if you want to know what the hell that is all about, then stay tuned after the next break.

251
00:19:34,682 --> 00:19:38,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Ryan, the number two thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl.

252
00:19:38,947 --> 00:19:48,357
[SPEAKER_33]: It's a bit of a plug, but boy, I'd rather be working at GameStop in Arden Fair Mall where you can reserve all your greatest new games coming out soon, like Legend of Zelda.

253
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:51,605
[SPEAKER_22]: If you don't reserve them there, I'll kill you.

254
00:19:52,105 --> 00:19:54,707
[SPEAKER_22]: Because my man is just lost.

255
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:56,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to be my bitch forever.

256
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:58,770
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't come and reserve things, Dan beats me.

257
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,291
[SPEAKER_22]: Quite often.

258
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:14,814
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's also entertaining to watch.

259
00:20:15,154 --> 00:20:18,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two thing I would rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

260
00:20:18,938 --> 00:20:19,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Napping.

261
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:21,000
[SPEAKER_22]: Good call.

262
00:20:23,802 --> 00:20:24,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather be taking a nap.

263
00:20:25,363 --> 00:20:25,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

264
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:29,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, number two thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

265
00:20:30,068 --> 00:20:30,888
[SPEAKER_22]: Buying more Propel.

266
00:20:31,889 --> 00:20:32,430
[SPEAKER_22]: And drinking it.

267
00:20:36,704 --> 00:20:38,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Buying more Propel and drinking it.

268
00:20:38,786 --> 00:20:39,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.

269
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:46,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Brad, the number one thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

270
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Jacking my hot spicy boner.

271
00:20:48,654 --> 00:20:50,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Jacking my hot spicy boner.

272
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:01,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, the number one thing that you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

273
00:21:01,484 --> 00:21:02,345
[SPEAKER_03]: He took mine!

274
00:21:05,106 --> 00:21:06,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my own boner.

275
00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:16,213
[SPEAKER_03]: No, anyways, um, well, shit, uh... No!

276
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:17,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, no.

277
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:23,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'd rather be, uh, killing stupid people.

278
00:21:24,438 --> 00:21:25,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Killing, killing stupid people.

279
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:26,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

280
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, maybe he's gonna change that.

281
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:30,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine, how about this?

282
00:21:30,342 --> 00:21:31,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting laid.

283
00:21:31,383 --> 00:21:31,683
[SPEAKER_03]: There.

284
00:21:31,743 --> 00:21:32,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting laid, alright.

285
00:21:32,904 --> 00:21:33,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

286
00:21:37,054 --> 00:21:37,414
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

287
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:41,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan, your number one thing you'd rather be doing in the Washington Bowl.

288
00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:41,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you.

289
00:21:41,535 --> 00:21:41,936
[SPEAKER_33]: I'll be.

290
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,456
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm totally going to win this vote here.

291
00:21:45,017 --> 00:21:47,477
[SPEAKER_33]: Big Black Cock!

292
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:51,539
[SPEAKER_33]: B-I-G-B-L-A-C-K-C-O-C-K, people!

293
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:53,339
[SPEAKER_33]: Big Black Cock!

294
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,260
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really gay.

295
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,960
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd rather be doing a Big Black Cock?

296
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,441
[SPEAKER_02]: That's gay.

297
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:03,094
[SPEAKER_34]: All right.

298
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,959
[SPEAKER_20]: He just wants it to exist instead of Super Bowl.

299
00:22:08,221 --> 00:22:10,785
[SPEAKER_20]: There shall be a big black cock for the masses.

300
00:22:11,726 --> 00:22:14,049
[SPEAKER_33]: And all shall worship it and be happy.

301
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:17,294
[SPEAKER_33]: And lo, God was pleased by big black cock.

302
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:23,726
[SPEAKER_02]: My number one thing that I put was masturbating.

303
00:22:24,206 --> 00:22:27,769
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was not actually a stress of PM to me that I should say that.

304
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:29,050
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually already had it written down.

305
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:29,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, you people know me.

306
00:22:30,411 --> 00:22:31,232

00:22:31,272 --> 00:22:32,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, that's kind of already on the list.

308
00:22:32,993 --> 00:22:36,276
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'll say... The slave waits while the masturbates.

309
00:22:37,537 --> 00:22:38,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine was a hot spicy boner.

310
00:22:39,018 --> 00:22:40,339

311
00:22:40,379 --> 00:22:41,800
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think I'm going to change it.

312
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say rather than the Super Bowl, I would rather get fucked up the ass.

313
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:46,504
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

314
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're infringing on the big black cock.

315
00:22:54,565 --> 00:22:55,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine's cool.

316
00:22:55,966 --> 00:22:58,508

[SPEAKER_02]: How about get fucked up the ass by the entire losing team?

319
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:20,501
[SPEAKER_02]: How about that?

320
00:23:21,102 --> 00:23:23,043
[SPEAKER_22]: Ew, no, then you'll get a disease.

321
00:23:23,964 --> 00:23:24,724

[SPEAKER_02]: First thing to go from the list.

00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:13,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not attack him while holding the microphone.

00:25:28,876 --> 00:25:29,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, no I'm not.

352
00:25:29,757 --> 00:25:32,980
[SPEAKER_03]: So, wisdom teeth pulling while awake has come off the list.

353
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,001
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't hurt.

354
00:25:34,281 --> 00:25:34,742
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, alright.

355
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,192
[SPEAKER_22]: I fell asleep when my listen to was pulled.

356
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,914
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm afraid of the dentist, so there.

357
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:44,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryan, something's got to come off this list.

358
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:57,945
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, there's no really much other reasons to go to Scandia rather than 2DX and Xtreme, and 2DX is already on the list, so I'm going to remove Go to Scandia.

00:25:59,554 --> 00:26:00,075
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey!

362
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take off watching Ally McFeel.

363
00:26:06,144 --> 00:26:10,751
[SPEAKER_02]: As great as that porno is, we haven't even talked about it yet, so there's no way in hell it's going to get a vote anyway.

364
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:12,834
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's kind of pointless.

365
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,043
[SPEAKER_22]: Being the token female, I'm going to take off the hot spicy boner.

366
00:26:17,063 --> 00:26:20,007
[SPEAKER_22]: I simply don't have one to know what the experience is like.

367
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:25,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd just like to point out that through all the guys in this room, getting fucked up the ass remained on the list.

368
00:26:27,094 --> 00:26:29,436
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like I said, it's not a gay thing.

369
00:26:30,137 --> 00:26:35,142
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just funny sounding, and we'll get votes, and we want to win because it's funny.

370
00:26:35,843 --> 00:26:36,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Random.

371
00:26:36,743 --> 00:26:36,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

372
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:37,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

373
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:48,326
[SPEAKER_02]: So, these are your choices, and you can send me your votes right now in private message in the chat room, or you can send them over email to orangelaunchradio at yahoo.com, but you better do it now.

374
00:26:48,446 --> 00:26:53,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, tell us, what are the things that they can vote on that they'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

375
00:26:53,347 --> 00:26:57,828
[SPEAKER_22]: Playing 2DX, shaving a monkey, fixing Ryan's stupid fucking PS2.

376

[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to take a quick break, and we'll be right back to reveal your list of things you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl.

379
00:27:20,283 --> 00:27:22,504
[SPEAKER_02]: You should put something that is truly ass-worthy.

380
00:27:22,524 --> 00:27:23,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that is truly ass-worthy.

381
00:27:23,845 --> 00:27:25,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I might have a twin remix on here.

382
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:26,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

383
00:27:27,307 --> 00:27:29,729
[SPEAKER_22]: You have to play the gayest song in all of Imani.

384
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:30,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what's that?

385

[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, I don't even know if I have that.

392
00:27:37,774 --> 00:27:38,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I have it.

393
00:27:38,514 --> 00:27:41,236
[SPEAKER_22]: You should do it because I gave it to you.

394
00:27:41,756 --> 00:27:42,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what?

395
00:27:42,877 --> 00:27:43,317

[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

397
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:48,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll look for Dynamite, but it's probably on one of your pre-show discs, huh?

398
00:27:49,021 --> 00:27:50,442
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I actually gave it to you.

399
00:27:50,522 --> 00:27:52,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to find it.

00:28:20,795 --> 00:28:22,236
[SPEAKER_02]: That would really suck.

408
00:28:23,016 --> 00:28:23,456
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it didn't.

415
00:28:33,573 --> 00:28:35,093
[SPEAKER_02]: How about this Upside Down remix?

00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:37,214
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the Eurobeat version of Upside Down.

[SPEAKER_03]: Winning the lottery should be up there at the top.

453
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but after winning the lottery, you can buy Propel and drink it, too.

454
00:35:15,432 --> 00:35:18,353
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy, like, vast amounts of Propel.

455
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:21,274
[SPEAKER_23]: If you won the lottery, you could get all of those things.

456
00:35:22,234 --> 00:35:23,095
[SPEAKER_23]: And my spicy boner.

457
00:35:23,975 --> 00:35:25,256
[SPEAKER_22]: And you could buy a CDX machine.

458
00:35:25,696 --> 00:35:27,036
[SPEAKER_22]: Or lots of tokens.

459
00:35:27,457 --> 00:35:28,917
[SPEAKER_20]: You could probably buy Scandi.

460
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:30,618
[SPEAKER_20]: There you go, buy Scandi.

461
00:35:31,377 --> 00:35:33,778
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't worry, Keaton, if we buy Scandia, we'll still keep your job.

462
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:35,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can stay employed at Scandia.

463
00:35:35,379 --> 00:35:41,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, actually, what I think we should do is buy Golfland, fire all the management, and then have the Scandia... And then turn it into a strip club!

464
00:35:42,561 --> 00:35:43,642
[SPEAKER_22]: Yee-haw!

465
00:35:44,702 --> 00:35:45,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

466
00:35:46,423 --> 00:35:49,344
[SPEAKER_22]: No, we turn half of it into a strip club and the other half into a better arcade.

467
00:35:49,504 --> 00:35:50,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, where they would have Upskirt DDR.

468
00:35:50,744 --> 00:35:51,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And have a naked water park.

469
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:52,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Upskirt DDR.

470
00:35:52,405 --> 00:35:53,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Upskirt DDR.

471
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the idea of an all-nude water park.

472
00:35:55,766 --> 00:35:57,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just turn Golfland into a nudist colony.

473
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:00,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait!

474
00:36:00,728 --> 00:36:07,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Nudist colony with one little thing, and it's gotta be, you know, like they have, you know, welcomes, all sorts of life, da-da-da-da-da, star.

475
00:36:08,016 --> 00:36:09,417
[SPEAKER_03]: No ugly people!

476
00:36:09,858 --> 00:36:16,405
[SPEAKER_03]: This includes you fat people, and you over 40 people, and you that apply to both of those.

477
00:36:17,306 --> 00:36:20,069
[SPEAKER_03]: No ugly people allowed.

478
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:21,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Period.

479
00:36:22,711 --> 00:36:24,235
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a pre-screening for this.

480
00:36:25,178 --> 00:36:26,300
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to like pass the test.

481
00:36:26,421 --> 00:36:28,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and Jamie and I are the pre-screeners.

482
00:36:28,385 --> 00:36:29,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing.

483
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:30,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

484
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:33,629
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no, no, no, yes!

485
00:36:34,649 --> 00:36:35,790
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to have a few tests.

486
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,030
[SPEAKER_03]: First, it's going to be a slightly small doorway.

487
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,211
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't fit through the doorway, you're not allowed to go in there first off.

488
00:36:41,612 --> 00:36:46,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, it's going to have maybe some sort of small animal, like a monkey or something.

489
00:36:47,094 --> 00:36:48,934
[SPEAKER_03]: You scare the monkey, you don't come in.

490
00:36:52,215 --> 00:36:53,436
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no, I'll just bring Shermie.

491
00:36:56,077 --> 00:36:57,658
[SPEAKER_22]: If Shermie doesn't like you, leave.

492
00:36:57,859 --> 00:36:58,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

493
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:04,103
[SPEAKER_22]: If she doesn't roll over and show you her belly, then you suck.

494
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,724
[SPEAKER_02]: If she doesn't wave her genitalia at you, then there's something wrong.

495
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:12,548
[SPEAKER_02]: No smelly people either, because there's some smelly people that go to Golfland to play guitar freaks.

496
00:37:13,529 --> 00:37:17,752
[SPEAKER_22]: One of them better be listening right now, because I'm going to tell you right now, fucking wash your ass.

497
00:37:17,772 --> 00:37:20,013
[SPEAKER_22]: No sweaty balls and no unwashed twat.

498
00:37:20,233 --> 00:37:20,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweaty balls.

499
00:37:21,694 --> 00:37:22,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweaty balls and unwashed twat.

500
00:37:23,726 --> 00:37:26,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Ryan, come talk to us about your unwashed twat.

501
00:37:28,031 --> 00:37:29,733
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have an unwashed twat, Ryan?

502
00:37:29,893 --> 00:37:31,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Has feminine odor and itching got you down?

503
00:37:33,237 --> 00:37:34,558
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you feeling not so fresh?

504
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,421
[SPEAKER_20]: Try Vagisil.

505
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:41,786
[SPEAKER_27]: Why don't you check on Vagiclean?

506
00:37:42,247 --> 00:37:45,150
[SPEAKER_33]: It's so hard when you just walk into a room and you're getting...

507
00:37:47,336 --> 00:37:48,136
[SPEAKER_18]: I hate you all.

508
00:37:52,098 --> 00:37:52,939
[SPEAKER_33]: I hate you all.

509
00:37:57,821 --> 00:38:00,222
[SPEAKER_33]: Meatballs and douche, yes, meatballs and douche.

510
00:38:00,883 --> 00:38:01,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, wait a minute.

511
00:38:02,143 --> 00:38:03,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, hold on, hold on.

512
00:38:03,424 --> 00:38:04,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold up for a minute here.

513
00:38:05,045 --> 00:38:10,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Mabel's in the chat room and he's crying because he's claiming that he's fat and ugly and if he was over 40 he wouldn't be able to get in.

514
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:13,012
[SPEAKER_02]: You were neither.

515
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,013
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're not fat or ugly.

516
00:38:15,053 --> 00:38:16,314
[SPEAKER_02]: You can come to our nudist colony.

517
00:38:16,334 --> 00:38:17,714
[SPEAKER_02]: So quit whining.

518
00:38:19,735 --> 00:38:21,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, there's a second rule to this.

519
00:38:21,536 --> 00:38:23,096
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called the pimp factor, okay?

520
00:38:23,336 --> 00:38:29,019
[SPEAKER_03]: You can look like whatever you want, but as long as you bring at least fine, really fine honeys in, you're okay.

521
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:29,879
[SPEAKER_22]: Bring me...

522
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:36,586
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to have a room, though, with, like, really, really pretty men going at it so I can watch them.

523
00:38:37,366 --> 00:38:37,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute, though.

524
00:38:37,926 --> 00:38:38,326
[SPEAKER_02]: No one under 18.

525
00:38:38,967 --> 00:38:39,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

526
00:38:39,807 --> 00:38:40,227
[SPEAKER_22]: No one under 18.

527
00:38:40,868 --> 00:38:41,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry.

528
00:38:41,388 --> 00:38:42,028
[SPEAKER_02]: We just can't have that.

529
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:42,708
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, guys.

530
00:38:42,748 --> 00:38:43,809
[SPEAKER_22]: But I need the happy room.

531
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:48,751
[SPEAKER_02]: We do like all our under 18 fans, you know, because we know we have a lot of under 18 people listening.

532
00:38:48,931 --> 00:38:49,591
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't get in trouble.

533
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:50,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, guys.

534
00:38:50,812 --> 00:38:51,792
[SPEAKER_22]: I want the happy room, though.

535
00:38:52,272 --> 00:38:53,393
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to have the happy room.

536
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:54,954
[SPEAKER_03]: They just have to sell it.

537
00:38:55,014 --> 00:38:56,175
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I can videotape it and sell it.

538
00:38:56,655 --> 00:38:59,358
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be like, you know, it could be like Beavis and Butthead.

539
00:38:59,658 --> 00:39:02,420
[SPEAKER_03]: You must be over 18 to be able to shoot skeet.

540
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you guys over 18?

541
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, no.

542
00:39:06,623 --> 00:39:07,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you guys over 18?

543
00:39:08,945 --> 00:39:09,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

544
00:39:09,465 --> 00:39:11,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you can just, see, there you go.

545
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:13,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay, that'll work.

546
00:39:13,248 --> 00:39:13,649
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll work.

547
00:39:13,789 --> 00:39:14,189
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

548
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,471
[SPEAKER_02]: If you say you're under 18, you can't get in.

549
00:39:17,491 --> 00:39:21,954
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you say you're over 18, then, you know, hey, we were only going off what you said, so.

550
00:39:22,935 --> 00:39:23,936
[SPEAKER_22]: I want the happy room.

551
00:39:26,617 --> 00:39:28,879
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, we could actually just turn it into a porn studio.

552
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,801
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we would, like, pay for everything that way.

553
00:39:33,242 --> 00:39:35,323
[SPEAKER_22]: Because porn's really cheap to make.

554
00:39:35,663 --> 00:39:39,566
[SPEAKER_22]: All you need is a video camera and, like, one of those handheld spotlights.

555
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:42,029
[SPEAKER_22]: You don't even need a script.

556
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:45,451
[SPEAKER_22]: Say, hey you, fuck, and then make something up.

557
00:39:46,632 --> 00:39:50,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of pornography, thank you for that lovely transition.

558
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:51,134
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your week?

559
00:39:52,214 --> 00:39:52,855
[SPEAKER_22]: Pornerific.

560
00:39:53,195 --> 00:39:53,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Pornerific.

561
00:39:54,275 --> 00:39:55,116
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your week looking?

562
00:39:57,165 --> 00:39:57,745
[SPEAKER_02]: and many more.

563
00:40:18,699 --> 00:40:37,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no, I was trying to, uh, yet again trying to crack the, uh, DDR Extreme disc, and, uh, so, in which case, I was, um, you know, I thought for some reason, actually, I figured out where everything is on the disc, and, um, what the fuck is so funny?

564
00:40:39,386 --> 00:40:41,487
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not you, sorry, I just showed Jamie something I typed.

565
00:40:41,507 --> 00:40:42,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Who is touching Jamie in there?

566
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:44,548
[SPEAKER_22]: Stop it!

567
00:40:45,508 --> 00:40:47,309
[SPEAKER_22]: I was having a laugh at somebody's expense.

568
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:50,586
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, we'll tell you guys during the video.

569
00:40:50,606 --> 00:40:51,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, okay.

570
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:55,492
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, I was... This is very distracting, you guys.

571
00:40:56,293 --> 00:40:56,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

572
00:40:58,696 --> 00:41:01,359
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I was trying to install Linux on my computer.

573
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:07,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I borrowed a couple copies of Linux from our friend Keith, and I was installing them on my computer.

574
00:41:07,406 --> 00:41:07,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

575
00:41:08,547 --> 00:41:11,050
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the damn thing didn't want to install for some reason.

576
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:25,808
[SPEAKER_03]: The installation program thought it knew how to partition my drives better than I did, and so it was a pain in the ass for about three days, and then finally I went out, bought Linux, installed it, everything's fine, but now I can't do what I wanted it to do in the first place, which was...

577
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got, okay, basically here's the situation.

578
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:33,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got on the arcade disc for DDR Extreme, there's a bunch of files on there.

579
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, they're images of actual, um, of the flashcards that it flashes.

580
00:41:37,424 --> 00:41:42,431
[SPEAKER_03]: So it basically copies this image to the flashcard, but in the images themselves are actually file trees.

581
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:43,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

582
00:42:04,574 --> 00:42:05,475
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was my week.

583
00:42:06,355 --> 00:42:06,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Exciting.

584
00:42:07,536 --> 00:42:08,196
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not.

585
00:42:09,397 --> 00:42:10,018
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right, it's not.

586
00:42:10,378 --> 00:42:12,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I'm just kidding.

587
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:13,620
[SPEAKER_02]: My week was pretty good.

588
00:42:15,181 --> 00:42:18,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I napped a lot, and I went out and did stuff.

589
00:42:18,283 --> 00:42:18,983
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, stuff.

590
00:42:19,964 --> 00:42:20,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I volunteered to be a prop.

591
00:42:46,513 --> 00:42:47,614
[SPEAKER_22]: I volunteered to be a prop.

592
00:42:47,934 --> 00:42:49,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and Jamie's on the cast too.

593
00:42:49,394 --> 00:42:55,197
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were here participating in the Rocky Horror rehearsal last night.

594
00:42:55,357 --> 00:42:58,938
[SPEAKER_02]: And somebody brought to cast rehearsal for Irene some pornography.

595
00:42:59,298 --> 00:43:00,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Some fine pornography.

596
00:43:01,439 --> 00:43:03,340
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was this porno called Ally McFeel.

597
00:43:07,102 --> 00:43:09,783
[SPEAKER_02]: And Irene was a dumb bitch, of course, and left it here.

598
00:43:09,803 --> 00:43:11,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

599
00:43:11,483 --> 00:43:12,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey.

600
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:14,965
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a woman like that.

[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

603
00:43:54,484 --> 00:44:00,848
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, just like on the real show, Ally McBeal, when they go to the law firm, all the lawyers and everybody, they're all fucking each other, basically.

604
00:44:01,569 --> 00:44:04,330
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, then we have the big trial.

605
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:05,531
[SPEAKER_02]: The big trial comes later.

606
00:44:05,911 --> 00:44:09,113
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted to play a clip from the trial for you guys.

607
00:44:09,133 --> 00:44:14,497
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have Johnny Cockring, who is... I have to giggle.

608
00:44:15,057 --> 00:44:16,338
[SPEAKER_22]: She gave him her panties and...

609
00:44:17,003 --> 00:44:20,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we have Johnny Cockering, and Ally McFeel gave Johnny Cockering her panties.

610
00:44:20,567 --> 00:44:22,009
[SPEAKER_22]: He sniffed them and put them in his jacket.

611
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:23,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and he sniffed them and put them in his jacket.

612
00:44:23,931 --> 00:44:28,257
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's basically the lawyer supporting the woman who had the dildo explode inside of her.

613
00:44:29,478 --> 00:44:34,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and Ally McFeel, her client is the company that made the exploding dildo.

614
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:36,666
[SPEAKER_22]: Who, by the way, fucks the other person.

615
00:44:37,346 --> 00:44:40,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, who, by the way, fucks the chick with the cavernous pussy in the beginning.

616
00:44:40,108 --> 00:44:41,449
[SPEAKER_02]: To see if she knows how to use the dildo.

617
00:44:41,469 --> 00:44:43,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, to see if she really knows how to use the dildo.

618
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:45,511
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, kind of an instruction manual.

619
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:51,355
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyway, we're going to play a clip from this fabulous porno, which, by the way, also guest stars Ron Jeremy.

620
00:44:52,115 --> 00:44:52,635
[SPEAKER_02]: That was cool.

621
00:44:52,655 --> 00:44:53,116
[SPEAKER_02]: That was humongous.

622
00:44:53,136 --> 00:44:55,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've never seen a real porno with Ron Jeremy in it.

623
00:44:56,738 --> 00:45:00,240
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry, but that was, like, it was big.

624
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:04,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's why he's popular.

625
00:45:04,623 --> 00:45:06,464
[SPEAKER_03]: He's ugly as hell, but he's got a fucking cute face.

626
00:45:06,924 --> 00:45:11,207
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god, he's repulsive in every way, but except his big, velvet chalk.

627
00:45:12,468 --> 00:45:17,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we're going to play a clip right now from the big trial for you guys.

628
00:45:17,052 --> 00:45:17,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

629
00:45:17,472 --> 00:45:19,313
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, by the way, nudist colony people?

630
00:45:20,274 --> 00:45:20,654
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry.

631
00:45:20,935 --> 00:45:21,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go ahead.

632
00:45:21,835 --> 00:45:26,539
[SPEAKER_22]: For all the nudist colony wannabes, by the way, if you're butt ugly, it's okay if you have a big dick.

633
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:26,919
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

634
00:45:29,568 --> 00:45:31,888
[SPEAKER_02]: That is big.

635
00:45:31,908 --> 00:45:32,629
[SPEAKER_22]: 12 inches or more.

636
00:45:33,209 --> 00:45:34,569
[SPEAKER_22]: Holy shit, I'm in.

637
00:45:34,989 --> 00:45:35,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Ow.

638
00:45:35,189 --> 00:45:38,390
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, but you have to wear a mask and shave your body hair.

639
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:39,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

640
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:40,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

641
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:43,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a clip from Ally McFeel here on Orange Lounge Radio.

642
00:45:43,751 --> 00:45:49,632
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you like Ally McFeel, since I don't want to get sued by the people who made this, go out and buy it right now.

643
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:51,692
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a wonderful porno.

644
00:45:51,732 --> 00:45:52,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Two thumbs up.

645
00:45:52,692 --> 00:45:53,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Way up.

646
00:45:53,892 --> 00:45:54,773
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, here we go.

647
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:55,993
[SPEAKER_22]: Remember, the audience is horny.

648
00:46:02,518 --> 00:46:03,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's not coming through.

649
00:46:03,498 --> 00:46:04,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, just one moment.

650
00:46:04,499 --> 00:46:05,579
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an issue.

651
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:07,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on one second.

652
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I have, I put it in the wrong hole, sorry.

653
00:46:14,902 --> 00:46:15,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try this again.

654
00:46:18,503 --> 00:46:23,184
[SPEAKER_24]: This offending instrument was manufactured by Mr. Boner's company.

655
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:25,000
[SPEAKER_28]: Objection!

656
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,541
[SPEAKER_28]: My client's name is Bone Herb.

657
00:46:28,122 --> 00:46:32,425
[SPEAKER_28]: As in Christ, I'd like to bone her tight little asshole with my big black cock.

658
00:46:32,445 --> 00:46:34,666
[SPEAKER_24]: Miss MacPhil, you're walking a tight line here.

659
00:46:36,948 --> 00:46:40,490
[SPEAKER_24]: Counsel will not refer to defendant as boner.

660
00:46:41,631 --> 00:46:47,295
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Bone Herb's company negligently manufactured this defective dildo.

661
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:49,877
[SPEAKER_24]: It will apparently damage my client's genitalia.

662
00:46:50,337 --> 00:46:51,978
[SPEAKER_24]: Emotional and physical harm has set in.

663
00:46:52,658 --> 00:46:53,039
[SPEAKER_24]: Chicken...

664
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,321
[SPEAKER_24]: Chocus Pocus is next.

665
00:46:58,761 --> 00:47:01,221
[SPEAKER_24]: Just I ask you, do the right thing.

666
00:47:01,701 --> 00:47:04,782
[SPEAKER_24]: If the dildos is not fit, then they are not legit.

667
00:47:07,443 --> 00:47:08,903
[SPEAKER_19]: Big black cock.

668
00:47:09,183 --> 00:47:14,644
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just really excited and Jamie and I started wetting our pants when she said big black cock.

669
00:47:17,305 --> 00:47:23,826
[SPEAKER_21]: The little gears started turning in Rob's head as he thought, how am I going to... If the dildos is not fit, they are not legit.

670
00:47:25,233 --> 00:47:26,514
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that bullshit?

671
00:47:27,995 --> 00:47:29,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Maple missed it, so we have to play it again.

672
00:47:29,776 --> 00:47:30,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, guys.

673
00:47:30,296 --> 00:47:30,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

674
00:47:30,836 --> 00:47:32,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, one more time.

675
00:47:32,757 --> 00:47:33,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Instant replay.

676
00:47:34,378 --> 00:47:35,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, sorry.

677
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:36,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get back here.

678
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,322
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be part of a new promo.

679
00:47:40,382 --> 00:47:40,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here we go.

680
00:47:40,882 --> 00:47:41,382
[SPEAKER_24]: Here we go.

681
00:47:41,402 --> 00:47:41,562
[SPEAKER_24]: Miss...

682
00:47:57,203 --> 00:47:58,083
[SPEAKER_22]: Big black cock.

683
00:47:58,283 --> 00:47:59,564
[SPEAKER_22]: And you know the judge looks like The Rock.

684
00:48:00,084 --> 00:48:02,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the judge looks just like The Rock.

685
00:48:02,304 --> 00:48:03,484
[SPEAKER_22]: With like little twisty spikes.

686
00:48:04,305 --> 00:48:06,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he said it was like a nerdy version of The Rock.

687
00:48:06,285 --> 00:48:06,805
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, he was hot.

688
00:48:07,405 --> 00:48:12,206
[SPEAKER_22]: This is actually one of the few straight porns that actually had good looking guys in it.

689
00:48:12,766 --> 00:48:15,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it actually had attractive males in this porn.

690
00:48:15,047 --> 00:48:15,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for Ron Jeremy.

691
00:48:15,707 --> 00:48:16,487
[SPEAKER_02]: That was psycho.

692
00:48:16,507 --> 00:48:17,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, except for Ron Jeremy.

693
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:19,188
[SPEAKER_02]: But he has a big dick, so it's okay.

694
00:48:19,228 --> 00:48:20,928
[SPEAKER_20]: Big dick, you know, made up for it all.

695
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:25,333
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, dear good lord.

696
00:48:56,097 --> 00:48:58,239
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

697
00:48:58,279 --> 00:48:59,561
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that scene was funny, though.

698
00:48:59,581 --> 00:49:02,064
[SPEAKER_03]: The one chick gets her teeth knocked out and he's all, ooh, a gummer.

699
00:49:02,364 --> 00:49:06,428
[SPEAKER_03]: And then later on she gets her teeth back again, like, ooh, what happened there?

700
00:49:07,109 --> 00:49:10,833
[SPEAKER_02]: This porno gets Orange Lounge's highest recommendation, by the way.

701
00:49:10,873 --> 00:49:11,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Two dicks up, way up.

702
00:49:11,674 --> 00:49:12,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see that other

703
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:16,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Upskirt Cam Pantsless Cam Crossdress or Upskirt Cam Military Kilt Cam

704
00:49:40,157 --> 00:49:44,741
[SPEAKER_22]: There's nothing as enjoyable as kilts worn the traditional way on a breezy day.

705
00:49:46,743 --> 00:49:47,383
[SPEAKER_34]: You're a pervert.

706
00:49:48,364 --> 00:49:51,707
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's really gotten me wondering about a lot of my townsfolk.

707
00:49:51,767 --> 00:49:53,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I got, you know, Bob the Cat.

708
00:49:53,789 --> 00:49:55,650
[SPEAKER_03]: He's wearing like a skirt throughout my town.

709
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:57,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what the fuck's going on, Bob?

710
00:49:57,832 --> 00:49:58,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob, you're a guy.

711
00:49:58,953 --> 00:50:01,816
[SPEAKER_03]: You're supposed to be wearing guy clothes, not a skirt.

712
00:50:02,955 --> 00:50:08,677
[SPEAKER_22]: There's this rhino in our town named Spike who has a band-aid on his face and he's all hardcore.

713
00:50:08,897 --> 00:50:09,977
[SPEAKER_22]: He was wearing this skull shirt.

714
00:50:10,477 --> 00:50:16,339
[SPEAKER_22]: And then one day he started wearing a blue muumuu with daisies on it.

715
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:18,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Your town makes people gay, remember?

716
00:50:18,339 --> 00:50:22,780
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, my town makes animals individual gay.

717
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,421
[SPEAKER_22]: My town is da gay.

718
00:50:25,401 --> 00:50:31,023
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, you know there's the triangle with Dina and Goldie and then Goldie left her for Barbara.

719
00:50:31,363 --> 00:50:31,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my.

720
00:50:32,677 --> 00:50:40,280
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, no, because we thought that Goldie was getting the twat action from Dina, you know, because Dina has that big long bill.

721
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:48,304
[SPEAKER_22]: And then, because she was saying sugar bill, like Dina says, and then all of a sudden she started saying, I suck, like Barbara says, because we hate Barbara, and she says, I suck.

722
00:50:48,564 --> 00:50:49,805
[SPEAKER_22]: Scan list, scan list.

723
00:50:49,865 --> 00:50:54,547
[SPEAKER_22]: I think I'm just going to change what Horned Thief, I tell, says, though, to my master again.

724
00:50:55,194 --> 00:50:58,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one in my town, Cody, he says you ass after everything.

725
00:50:58,536 --> 00:50:59,717
[SPEAKER_02]: So he goes, what's going on you ass?

726
00:50:59,797 --> 00:51:03,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got my, I've got, what was it, Ricky the squirrel or whatever.

727
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that little asshole that moved from my village.

728
00:51:06,121 --> 00:51:09,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I changed his thing to say skanky ho after everything he says.

729
00:51:11,304 --> 00:51:12,185
[SPEAKER_03]: My girlfriend loves it.

730
00:51:13,225 --> 00:51:14,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Does she enjoy my letter?

731
00:51:15,087 --> 00:51:17,308
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, why do you send me stuff?

732
00:51:18,629 --> 00:51:20,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some... Was she freaked out?

733
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:22,711
[SPEAKER_03]: All the townsfolk don't understand anything I write them.

734
00:51:23,132 --> 00:51:23,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And like...

735
00:51:23,905 --> 00:51:26,746
[SPEAKER_02]: The way, okay, I'm going to give you a big tip on Animal Crossing, everybody.

736
00:51:26,766 --> 00:51:28,187
[SPEAKER_22]: This is one of my letters.

737
00:51:28,287 --> 00:51:32,589
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to get things from the villagers, write a full letter.

738
00:51:32,629 --> 00:51:35,290
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to write like six lines of letter to your villagers.

739
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:36,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it in a way.

740
00:51:36,651 --> 00:51:37,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it works.

741
00:51:37,231 --> 00:51:37,631
[SPEAKER_02]: All the time.

742
00:51:37,711 --> 00:51:40,472
[SPEAKER_22]: All I do is, Dear so-and-so, you suck.

743
00:51:40,553 --> 00:51:42,093
[SPEAKER_22]: I want you to die and go to hell.

744
00:51:42,613 --> 00:51:45,215
[SPEAKER_22]: I hate your guts and I wish that you never moved to my village.

745
00:51:45,555 --> 00:51:46,215
[SPEAKER_22]: Love, Sakura.

746
00:51:46,735 --> 00:51:47,616
[SPEAKER_22]: And I get stuff from them.

747
00:51:48,516 --> 00:51:51,679
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I wrote one to Cody that said, All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.

748
00:51:51,759 --> 00:51:53,220
[SPEAKER_02]: All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.

749
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,741
[SPEAKER_02]: All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.

750
00:51:54,761 --> 00:51:56,122
[SPEAKER_02]: All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.

751
00:51:56,462 --> 00:51:57,243
[SPEAKER_02]: And he sent me furniture.

752
00:51:58,844 --> 00:52:00,145
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

753
00:52:00,285 --> 00:52:01,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a letter from Goose today.

754
00:52:01,566 --> 00:52:04,829
[SPEAKER_18]: She's like, I was outside shaking trees, and a furniture fell on my head.

755
00:52:04,849 --> 00:52:06,030
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was it.

756
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, why are you sending me shit?

757
00:52:08,632 --> 00:52:10,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even want to talk to you, dumb bitch.

758
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I like when they're giving you tips.

759
00:52:12,515 --> 00:52:13,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know how to catch fish yet?

760
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I just gave you a fish, you jackass.

761
00:52:16,218 --> 00:52:17,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you think I got it from?

762
00:52:18,834 --> 00:52:20,855
[SPEAKER_22]: We want to be slapped in the head by a wet trout.

763
00:52:20,915 --> 00:52:22,456
[SPEAKER_22]: By the way, we can just slap somebody in the chatroom.

764
00:52:22,476 --> 00:52:24,357
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to slap people in the chatroom with wet trouts?

765
00:52:24,437 --> 00:52:25,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, go for it.

766
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:26,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you've got to click on their name first.

767
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:28,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you slap them.

768
00:52:28,099 --> 00:52:28,620
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

769
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,940
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

770
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,222
[SPEAKER_02]: You just slapped 23rd Magus with a large trout.

771
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:33,142
[SPEAKER_02]: How was that?

772
00:52:33,162 --> 00:52:33,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to slap somebody else.

773
00:52:33,803 --> 00:52:34,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you enjoy that?

774
00:52:34,283 --> 00:52:35,344
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to slap somebody else?

775
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:38,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright!

776
00:52:41,667 --> 00:52:42,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you slapping myself?

777
00:52:46,059 --> 00:52:48,882
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Jamie's having fun slapping people with trouts.

778
00:52:52,667 --> 00:52:53,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, hold on.

779
00:52:53,768 --> 00:52:54,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan, yes.

780
00:52:54,268 --> 00:52:55,209
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, Ryan pointed out something.

781
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:58,233
[SPEAKER_22]: It says in God we trust in the thing, but it should say in God we thrust.

782
00:52:59,534 --> 00:53:00,135
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, you know what?

783
00:53:00,155 --> 00:53:01,657
[SPEAKER_22]: There's scenes in here that never happened.

784
00:53:03,467 --> 00:53:04,608
[SPEAKER_22]: These are just like promo pictures.

785
00:53:29,016 --> 00:53:30,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

786
00:53:31,362 --> 00:53:32,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

787
00:53:32,606 --> 00:53:35,674
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jamie's having fun slapping people in the chat room with, uh, trouts.

788
00:53:40,537 --> 00:53:43,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I saw something funny on Saturday.

789
00:53:43,739 --> 00:53:51,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I was outside after playing a vigorous game of DDR Extreme, and I was tired, you know, airing out my shoes and whatnot, and I'm watching the batting cages.

790
00:53:52,445 --> 00:54:02,752
[SPEAKER_03]: And stupid kid number one, and I love it when stupid people get punished, stupid kid number one decides, I'm going to go bat in the batting cage, and his father's watching him and stuff.

791
00:54:03,152 --> 00:54:06,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, stupid fat chubby kid number one decides to try to hit the ball.

792
00:54:06,935 --> 00:54:09,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Misses the ball, and so it hits the back whole thing there.

793
00:54:10,237 --> 00:54:13,399
[SPEAKER_03]: So stupid kid number one goes, I'm going to pick up the ball and hit it!

794
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,702
[SPEAKER_03]: So he picks up the ball, stands back up, thwap!

795
00:54:16,742 --> 00:54:19,143
[SPEAKER_03]: In the back of his head with a 50 mile an hour softball.

796
00:54:19,364 --> 00:54:20,905
[SPEAKER_03]: And the stupid kid falls in ground.

797
00:54:21,445 --> 00:54:24,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Started busting up.

798
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:27,629
[SPEAKER_18]: You didn't look at the pictures on this board.

799
00:54:27,649 --> 00:54:28,970
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to see the pictures.

800
00:54:30,535 --> 00:54:33,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, uh, he looks like he's having fun.

801
00:54:35,159 --> 00:54:37,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, she's looking like she's having some fun.

802
00:54:38,422 --> 00:54:39,783
[SPEAKER_03]: She's sucking cock.

803
00:54:41,305 --> 00:54:45,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, getting done, sucking more cock.

804
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:46,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

805
00:54:48,171 --> 00:54:49,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Ally McFeel.

806
00:54:49,171 --> 00:54:51,494
[SPEAKER_02]: We've started an outbreak of slapping in the chatroom.

807
00:54:51,514 --> 00:54:53,896
[SPEAKER_34]: Ah, it's all purple.

808
00:54:55,297 --> 00:54:56,358
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, back to Bimani.

809
00:54:57,995 --> 00:55:04,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp

810
00:55:27,377 --> 00:55:27,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:27,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo.

812
00:55:28,918 --> 00:55:29,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

813
00:55:29,918 --> 00:55:30,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's see.

814
00:55:30,298 --> 00:55:35,739
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're going to be playing on the break here is going to be two remix songs from Club Mix, actually.

815
00:55:35,759 --> 00:55:40,881
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got Jam Jam Reggae, and we also have... Ska Go Go, right?

816
00:55:40,901 --> 00:55:41,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Ska Go Go, yes.

817
00:55:42,201 --> 00:55:48,463
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are both... The first one is Jam Jam Reggae, the Jam Jam remix by Good Cool.

818
00:55:48,863 --> 00:55:51,364
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second one is actually remixed by the same group.

819
00:55:52,644 --> 00:55:55,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it's actually arranged by Ken Matsu... I don't know.

820
00:55:56,565 --> 00:55:56,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Matsumoto

821
00:57:33,921 --> 00:57:34,969
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's rock tomorrow.

822
00:58:09,429 --> 00:58:17,886
[SPEAKER_10]: And will you ever be the best of friends You shout something you don't win You shout something you don't win

823
00:58:56,014 --> 00:58:57,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on baby Let's dream a dream together A dream

824
01:00:37,261 --> 01:00:42,403
[SPEAKER_19]: Listen to Orange Dogs Radio, where you can witness Rob being fucked up the ass by Brad.

825
01:00:42,783 --> 01:00:44,064
[SPEAKER_33]: Brad did a good job.

826
01:00:44,284 --> 01:00:48,545
[SPEAKER_33]: All that Rob's asshole is quite large by now, like a mason jar.

827
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:54,167
[SPEAKER_33]: You could hold strawberry preserves in Rob's rectum now, and have it tightly sealed.

828
01:00:56,828 --> 01:00:57,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

829
01:00:58,409 --> 01:00:59,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, baby, I have the hugest...

830
01:01:05,632 --> 01:01:08,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it's not my fault all the boys and girls love me.

831
01:01:08,215 --> 01:01:08,835
[SPEAKER_18]: Does Irene know?

832
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:13,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Irene was sitting on my lap.

833
01:01:15,843 --> 01:01:16,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

834
01:01:17,725 --> 01:01:19,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, shall we do the FUs of the week now?

835
01:01:20,327 --> 01:01:22,069
[SPEAKER_22]: Would that be like an extension cord?

836
01:01:24,552 --> 01:01:25,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Blink, blink, blink.

837
01:01:26,373 --> 01:01:26,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

838
01:01:28,725 --> 01:01:32,486
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have an FU of the week, you can send those over a private message or email.

839
01:01:32,766 --> 01:01:33,726
[SPEAKER_22]: I want TerraMix today.

840
01:01:34,346 --> 01:01:35,246
[SPEAKER_02]: You want TerraMix today?

841
01:01:35,266 --> 01:01:35,767
[SPEAKER_22]: TerraMix.

842
01:01:35,907 --> 01:01:37,187
[SPEAKER_22]: Picky, picky, picky.

843
01:01:38,167 --> 01:01:39,707
[SPEAKER_22]: Picky, picky, picky.

844
01:01:40,808 --> 01:01:41,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Gross.

845
01:01:42,128 --> 01:01:42,948
[SPEAKER_22]: That was a chocolate burp.

846
01:01:43,068 --> 01:01:44,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's have at it.

847
01:01:44,148 --> 01:01:47,649
[SPEAKER_22]: This burp was brought to you by Russell Stover Chocolate Truffles.

848
01:01:48,669 --> 01:01:49,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.

849
01:01:49,449 --> 01:01:50,830
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, you look like you're trying to deep throat me.

850
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:51,470
[SPEAKER_22]: This is fucked up.

851
01:01:58,812 --> 01:02:01,453
[SPEAKER_18]: So a sound clip for a future episode.

852
01:02:29,758 --> 01:02:31,338
[SPEAKER_23]: Gentlemen, DarkSakura has a dick.

853
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:33,319
[SPEAKER_20]: I do not.

854
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,360
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the next intro right there.

855
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:39,561
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a dick.

856
01:02:39,821 --> 01:02:41,701
[SPEAKER_19]: The next fuck you goes to Rob.

857
01:02:42,121 --> 01:02:42,762
[SPEAKER_19]: And Brad.

858
01:02:43,062 --> 01:02:43,602
[SPEAKER_19]: And Dan.

859
01:02:43,782 --> 01:02:44,082
[SPEAKER_19]: And Dan.

860
01:02:44,102 --> 01:02:44,782
[SPEAKER_19]: This is KTMI.

861
01:02:44,882 --> 01:02:45,622
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'm sorry.

862
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:04,637
[SPEAKER_22]: And my other fuck you to me goes toward America for being stupid.

863
01:03:05,318 --> 01:03:10,483
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, what about American football has to do with using your feet but taking the ball?

864
01:03:10,503 --> 01:03:14,507
[SPEAKER_22]: It happens like for what, one occurrence in the whole game?

865
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:18,711
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole having to run around and everything might have to do with being stupid.

866
01:03:19,766 --> 01:03:20,827
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't kick the ball.

867
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:26,557
[SPEAKER_20]: That's why soccer should be football like it is everywhere else in the goddamn world.

868
01:03:26,897 --> 01:03:28,019
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not called kickball.

869
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:36,298
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the thing, here's the thing though, I want to say.

870
01:03:36,338 --> 01:03:39,341
[SPEAKER_23]: The thing is that America doesn't give a shit about soccer.

871
01:03:39,841 --> 01:03:45,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Soccer is not important in America.

872
01:03:46,026 --> 01:03:51,950
[SPEAKER_22]: And by the way, American football is a rip-off of rugby, which is a much cooler, violent, bloodier sport.

873
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:53,191
[SPEAKER_22]: Because you know what?

874
01:03:53,571 --> 01:03:56,313
[SPEAKER_22]: There's something about, okay, first of all, there's the guys that play it.

875
01:03:56,934 --> 01:04:01,938
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of them are really nicely built, and I don't look like they've been swallowing steroids since they were two years old.

876
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:08,153
[SPEAKER_22]: They don't have necks with the circumference of a watermelon, okay?

877
01:04:09,154 --> 01:04:13,856
[SPEAKER_20]: They look like normal guys, and they're muscular, and they have this nice butt.

878
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:16,358
[SPEAKER_22]: And then they get all bloody, which is even better.

879
01:04:17,418 --> 01:04:18,439
[SPEAKER_23]: Because Jimmy's got a dick.

880
01:04:26,884 --> 01:04:31,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Mabel would like to add that soccer is only cool if you're playing Virtua Striker at MGL with another friend.

881
01:04:32,695 --> 01:04:33,515
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, no.

882
01:04:35,016 --> 01:04:37,577
[SPEAKER_20]: Although, and you know, it was really awesome.

883
01:04:37,757 --> 01:04:39,757
[SPEAKER_21]: They even made it into one.

884
01:04:39,857 --> 01:04:46,499
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think there was a lot of times where they had to thank me and thank him all the time and Aristotle got to come in and work.

885
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:48,040
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, who needs to get fucked?

886
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:48,380
I'm sorry.

887
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,840
What else is there to think about?

888
01:04:49,921 --> 01:04:53,422
[SPEAKER_21]: Not necessarily who needs to get fucked, but what needs to get fucked here.

889
01:04:53,482 --> 01:04:53,522
Um...

890
01:05:01,491 --> 01:05:13,480
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah, um, fuck me not having a way to get to Hayward next weekend, because Dan doesn't want me to drive my car to Hayward because I just got it.

891
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:21,906
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I would also like to say that my CD player is working, so I would charge my CD for the week, you know.

892
01:05:21,926 --> 01:05:24,007
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, what was the one that I was talking about?

893
01:05:24,027 --> 01:05:24,127
No.

894
01:05:24,187 --> 01:05:24,508
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, Walthland?

895
01:05:31,008 --> 01:05:32,650
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I don't go there anymore.

896
01:05:34,591 --> 01:05:35,612
[SPEAKER_22]: If your brain could.

897
01:05:35,993 --> 01:05:39,796
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the first question.

898
01:05:39,896 --> 01:05:46,702
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I would like to say thank you to my lack of man sex.

899
01:05:47,003 --> 01:05:47,343
[SPEAKER_34]: Brain.

900
01:05:48,824 --> 01:05:49,845
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't have any man sex.

901
01:05:50,025 --> 01:05:53,969
[SPEAKER_02]: You were asking for my brain earlier.

902
01:05:54,189 --> 01:05:55,090
[SPEAKER_22]: And I need more doujinshi.

903
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:58,691
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, Matt, give us your Abuse of the Week.

904
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:14,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, let's see, the first FU goes to Linux!

905
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:17,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you Linux, you stupid installer!

906
01:06:17,912 --> 01:06:21,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Work right for once, goddammit, you're free, you should be working!

907
01:06:22,392 --> 01:06:35,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see here, I installed three versions of Linux this weekend, 7.1 decided, gee, I don't feel like I'm gonna install at all, because I'm gonna tell you that your blank 20 gig hard drive has not enough space for me to install my stupid program.

908
01:06:36,275 --> 01:06:42,960
[SPEAKER_03]: So, then I tried installing Red Hat 7.0, got that working, and it's a Japanese copy!

909
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:45,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't read Japanese, so that's not going to do me any good.

910
01:06:45,761 --> 01:06:51,185
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, finally, I installed Mandrake 6.4, and, well, you know what?

911
01:06:51,225 --> 01:06:53,186
[SPEAKER_03]: That program's so old, it doesn't run Jack.

912
01:06:53,307 --> 01:06:59,591
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't understand what my monitor is, it doesn't even know what my video card is, so that didn't do me any good, like installing Windows 3.0.

913
01:07:06,516 --> 01:07:09,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid bootloader that puts in there instead of the Windows bootloader.

914
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:14,265
[SPEAKER_03]: It causes the program to make my Windows kind of glitch out a little bit every now and then.

915
01:07:14,305 --> 01:07:17,448
[SPEAKER_03]: So that sucks because I have to reinstall Windows and that all makes sense.

916
01:07:18,835 --> 01:07:22,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, other than that, F you to the DMV.

917
01:07:23,256 --> 01:07:24,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the DMV?

918
01:07:24,196 --> 01:07:29,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I can't attack the stupid drivers anymore because you're still stupid and nothing's going to ever help you.

919
01:07:30,198 --> 01:07:34,759
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to yell at the DMV for letting you stupid drivers get on the roads in the first place.

920
01:07:35,019 --> 01:07:36,079
[SPEAKER_03]: You're fucking stupid.

921
01:07:36,399 --> 01:07:40,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you know, let people take the test and fail the test numerous times.

922
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:43,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Say, well, I tried to start by putting them on the roads.

923
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:45,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate you!

924
01:07:46,004 --> 01:07:46,864
[SPEAKER_03]: You're stupid!

925
01:07:47,265 --> 01:07:49,266
[SPEAKER_03]: You're part of the government, which makes you worse!

926
01:07:49,506 --> 01:07:51,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the government sucks!

927
01:07:51,808 --> 01:07:53,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I expand on that?

928
01:07:53,929 --> 01:07:56,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

929
01:07:56,151 --> 01:07:56,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

930
01:07:57,712 --> 01:08:01,434
[SPEAKER_03]: This also, you know, NFBs to old people.

931
01:08:01,454 --> 01:08:04,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know what?

932
01:08:04,756 --> 01:08:09,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I think after a certain age, you outlive your usefulness, and you should be put down.

933
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,541
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some people who've been in the green room.

934
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:19,467
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to see now old people, okay?

935
01:08:20,267 --> 01:08:21,128
[SPEAKER_03]: They're stupid.

936
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:22,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate them.

937
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:26,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, actually, also, F you for, uh, reality TV shows.

938
01:08:27,653 --> 01:08:29,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I love reality TV.

939
01:08:29,074 --> 01:08:32,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop popping up like freaking, I don't know what, dammit.

940
01:08:32,377 --> 01:08:33,538
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the fucking plague.

941
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:34,919
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a, it's like a TV.

942
01:08:34,979 --> 01:08:36,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what, we're gonna watch people's

943
01:08:37,244 --> 01:08:37,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep themselves in the head!

944
01:08:38,185 --> 01:08:39,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what, we're gonna watch Brides get mad!

945
01:08:40,066 --> 01:08:44,148
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree, you know what, that Bridezilla, Man vs. Beast, all that shit, completely useless.

946
01:08:44,188 --> 01:08:45,869
[SPEAKER_02]: But surreal life, best show ever.

947
01:08:46,629 --> 01:08:49,791
[SPEAKER_22]: But that Bridezilla thing is the reason why I want it alone.

948
01:08:50,071 --> 01:08:57,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, um, I did find it funny though that they had, uh, 100 Mitch, or like 50 Mitch's pull a jet and had him against the elephant.

949
01:08:57,595 --> 01:08:59,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Mitch pulling anything is funny.

950
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:01,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but yeah.

951
01:09:01,957 --> 01:09:02,818
[SPEAKER_03]: So you watched it!

952
01:09:03,378 --> 01:09:04,619
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I saw the commercial.

953
01:09:04,999 --> 01:09:05,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

954
01:09:06,488 --> 01:09:08,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I WATCHED THE COMMERCIAL!

955
01:09:08,969 --> 01:09:09,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

956
01:09:09,849 --> 01:09:17,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so, um, also, another FU to Crowded Arcade, because I don't like coin lines that are 16 coins long.

957
01:09:17,272 --> 01:09:25,535
[SPEAKER_03]: One, no one can figure out what turn they're up, and also, um, I don't like waiting, like, 20 minutes between games, or half an hour or whatnot.

958
01:09:27,035 --> 01:09:31,237
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, pretty weak, but that's my FU.

959
01:09:31,337 --> 01:09:31,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.

960
01:09:31,817 --> 01:09:33,998
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU of the week!

961
01:09:34,941 --> 01:09:40,544
[SPEAKER_02]: goes to Brad for making me late for that last segment so that Jamie could have her way with making fun of me.

962
01:09:43,696 --> 01:09:46,117
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like to also give an F you to the coin line.

963
01:09:46,377 --> 01:09:47,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I've ranted about this weeks ago.

964
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:49,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely useless.

965
01:09:49,938 --> 01:09:51,018
[SPEAKER_02]: It's useless these days.

966
01:09:51,278 --> 01:09:56,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the days of Street Fighter when everybody would like watch everybody else play and stuff, it kept places a little better.

967
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,061
[SPEAKER_02]: When people use custom coins, I guess it kind of works.

968
01:10:00,861 --> 01:10:02,702
[SPEAKER_02]: But the way it is now, it doesn't work.

969
01:10:02,742 --> 01:10:03,802
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a sign-up sheet.

970
01:10:03,962 --> 01:10:04,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck the coin line.

971
01:10:04,763 --> 01:10:05,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it.

972
01:10:05,603 --> 01:10:06,103
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stupid.

973
01:10:06,503 --> 01:10:07,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to cut in front of everybody.

974
01:10:09,164 --> 01:10:11,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Until you get a better system, I play first.

975
01:10:15,427 --> 01:10:27,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my other FU goes toward not having a Duo RX because I want to play Strider and Sapphire.

976
01:10:27,698 --> 01:10:27,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

977
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:43,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for sharing that.

978
01:10:43,355 --> 01:10:45,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go around the room and hear our guest's FU's of the week.

979
01:10:47,017 --> 01:10:49,799
[SPEAKER_33]: What are you handing me the mic for?

980
01:10:50,259 --> 01:10:54,582
[SPEAKER_33]: Only thing I gotta fuck you is, you know, as much as he's given the U.S.

981
01:10:54,642 --> 01:10:59,705
[SPEAKER_33]: lately, I'd like to put a fuck you out to Itagaki for completely lying to the U.S.

982
01:10:59,745 --> 01:11:04,388
[SPEAKER_33]: about DOA Extreme Beach Volleyball and pushing back the next Virtua Cup for another year.

983
01:11:04,748 --> 01:11:05,208
[SPEAKER_33]: Fuck you.

984
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:08,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Any FU's of the week, Brad?

985
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:09,431
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU goes to drama.

986
01:11:09,451 --> 01:11:09,871
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

987
01:11:11,624 --> 01:11:13,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I have an FU for drama, too.

988
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:13,605
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks.

989
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,566
[SPEAKER_02]: No more drama in my life.

990
01:11:18,686 --> 01:11:20,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, wait, I have my anthem.

991
01:11:20,726 --> 01:11:23,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my anthem because I'm so sick of drama.

992
01:11:23,607 --> 01:11:24,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had it with drama.

993
01:11:24,847 --> 01:11:25,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want no more drama.

994
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:28,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I have... No, wait, I have my anthem.

995
01:11:28,928 --> 01:11:29,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

996
01:11:29,548 --> 01:11:30,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, I've got it somewhere.

997
01:11:30,909 --> 01:11:31,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is it?

998
01:11:31,309 --> 01:11:34,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it, damn it.

999
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:35,230
[SPEAKER_18]: Shit.

1000
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:36,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it somewhere.

1001
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:36,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

1002
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:38,791
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to my computer for being unorganized.

1003
01:11:41,437 --> 01:11:41,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll find it.

1004
01:11:43,938 --> 01:11:45,678
[SPEAKER_02]: F this song, this song's so annoying.

1005
01:11:45,758 --> 01:11:47,039
[SPEAKER_05]: You picked it.

1006
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:48,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I did.

1007
01:11:49,899 --> 01:11:51,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck this paper airplane!

1008
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:57,862
[SPEAKER_03]: F you the random-ish eartrick for picking bad songs all the time.

1009
01:11:57,882 --> 01:11:59,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you made me late for the last segment.

1010
01:11:59,962 --> 01:12:02,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like playing QD Chaser three times in a row, thank you, random.

1011
01:12:04,264 --> 01:12:05,924
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to play QD Chaser how many times in a row?

1012
01:12:06,044 --> 01:12:08,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Three times in a row, so it's a random suck.

1013
01:12:09,449 --> 01:12:11,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't find my song, piss me off.

1014
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:12,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.

1015
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:14,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well, I guess another time.

1016
01:12:14,832 --> 01:12:15,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well.

1017
01:12:15,272 --> 01:12:15,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well, a hopeless quest.

1018
01:12:16,012 --> 01:12:18,414
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, let's read the chatroom FUs, shall we?

1019
01:12:32,076 --> 01:12:39,312
[SPEAKER_02]: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Fuck being tired, fuck algebra 2 that is, fuck algebra 2 and fuck me for not being able to type

1020
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:42,741
[SPEAKER_02]: EOSFEB!

1021
01:12:42,821 --> 01:12:44,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you to people with fuck yous.

1022
01:12:44,602 --> 01:12:45,602
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you have to be mad about?

1023
01:12:45,622 --> 01:12:46,803
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a new Matrix trailer.

1024
01:12:47,283 --> 01:12:48,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, I take that back.

1025
01:12:48,524 --> 01:12:54,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you to all the sportsbooks here who paid the Raiders to throw the game after overly hyping how much ass the Raiders were going to kick ass.

1026
01:12:54,727 --> 01:12:56,548
[SPEAKER_02]: The house always wins because the people make stupid bets.

1027
01:12:56,568 --> 01:12:59,290
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about there's nothing to be fucking mad about?

1028
01:12:59,530 --> 01:13:01,391
[SPEAKER_03]: The Matrix movie isn't out yet.

1029
01:13:01,431 --> 01:13:02,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Throw up the trailer.

1030
01:13:02,191 --> 01:13:04,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that to wait like three months for the movie?

1031
01:13:04,233 --> 01:13:05,533
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too long!

1032
01:13:05,633 --> 01:13:06,074
Oh, Christ.

1033
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:11,901
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck the Daredevil movie.

1034
01:13:12,562 --> 01:13:18,007
[SPEAKER_22]: Ben Affleck will make a shitty Daredevil and the chick that got to play Elektra looks nothing like her.

1035
01:13:18,487 --> 01:13:19,448
[SPEAKER_22]: But I'm going to see it anyway.

1036
01:13:20,349 --> 01:13:22,191
[SPEAKER_22]: And fuck me for wanting to see it.

1037
01:13:22,291 --> 01:13:28,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, come on.

1038
01:13:28,297 --> 01:13:29,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Elektra is Asian.

1039
01:13:30,245 --> 01:13:31,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Her character's Asian.

1040
01:13:31,846 --> 01:13:33,127
[SPEAKER_03]: The chicken alias is white.

1041
01:13:33,627 --> 01:13:35,668
[SPEAKER_03]: And not just white, trailer trash white.

1042
01:13:35,748 --> 01:13:37,129
[SPEAKER_22]: They needed to get Tia Carrere to play her.

1043
01:13:37,729 --> 01:13:39,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, or Asian Carrere.

1044
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:40,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Tia Carrere is the shit.

1045
01:13:43,212 --> 01:13:46,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking... Dean's World is the shit.

1046
01:13:46,133 --> 01:13:47,394
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not Lucy Liu, man.

1047
01:13:47,494 --> 01:13:48,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Ugh, Lucy Liu sucks.

1048
01:13:49,195 --> 01:13:52,716
[SPEAKER_03]: How about the chick from Crutch and Tigger Didn't Drag?

1049
01:13:53,217 --> 01:13:53,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, um...

1050
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,202
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, yeah, the one that was in Rush Hour 2.

1051
01:13:56,242 --> 01:14:00,005
[SPEAKER_03]: She would have been fucking awesome, because she taught and she kicked ass.

1052
01:14:00,025 --> 01:14:01,146
[SPEAKER_03]: She actually knows martial arts.

1053
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:04,288
[SPEAKER_03]: The chick in Alias is just a fucking little wannabe bitch.

1054
01:14:04,729 --> 01:14:07,551
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we should have a later segment, by the way, about Kung Fu Wins.

1055
01:14:07,571 --> 01:14:10,013
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what some people would like to point out?

1056
01:14:10,133 --> 01:14:13,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if the chick that plays Elektra doesn't look like her, Jennifer Garner gots ass.

1057
01:14:13,957 --> 01:14:15,498
[SPEAKER_02]: That ass could make J-Lo cry.

1058
01:14:15,738 --> 01:14:18,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, you're desperate, because she is fucking ugly.

1059
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:19,902
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, Elektra is Asian.

1060
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:21,742
[SPEAKER_02]: You are desperate.

1061
01:14:22,663 --> 01:14:26,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Bluheimer wanted to share the trailer trash white would be a cool new Crayola color.

1062
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:34,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I'd rather see Final Destination 2, because I heard people get killed very violently in funny ways.

1063
01:14:34,961 --> 01:14:35,301
[SPEAKER_24]: Cool!

1064
01:14:36,656 --> 01:14:39,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny Death is always fun.

1065
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:42,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Except, you know what, this one time, I have another FU.

1066
01:14:43,144 --> 01:14:53,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to F my best friend from high school, not literally, but I'd like to send out an FU to my best friend from high school because one day I was in a really shitty mood, and he said, I know how I'm going to cheer you up, Rob.

1067
01:14:53,497 --> 01:14:55,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to my house to watch Faces of Death.

1068
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:03,896
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we started watching Faces of Death, and I'm sorry, just, you don't watch it when you're already feeling sad.

1069
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,417
[SPEAKER_03]: That movie's hilarious!

1070
01:15:05,437 --> 01:15:06,278
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?

1071
01:15:06,318 --> 01:15:06,999
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so hilarious!

1072
01:15:07,179 --> 01:15:08,300
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so hilarious!

1073
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:15,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that one of the guys, the guy with the station wagon that puts a rocket on the back and wings on it, and it flies over the river, he explodes mid-air.

1074
01:15:16,068 --> 01:15:16,989
[SPEAKER_03]: What a dumbass!

1075
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:21,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw some guy, he was skydiving, and he gets eaten by a crocodile.

1076
01:15:21,233 --> 01:15:22,194
[SPEAKER_02]: It was disgusting.

1077
01:15:23,567 --> 01:15:25,448
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was gross.

1078
01:15:25,548 --> 01:15:30,030
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, you know what, you know what, quote, horror movie, end quote, had funny deaths?

1079
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:30,451
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

1080
01:15:30,471 --> 01:15:31,751
[SPEAKER_22]: It was all the Nightmare on Elm Street movies.

1081
01:15:32,031 --> 01:15:33,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Nightmare on Elm Street movies.

1082
01:15:33,372 --> 01:15:34,072
[SPEAKER_22]: That was funny deaths.

1083
01:15:34,192 --> 01:15:41,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Movie funny deaths are cool because you always laugh and go, oh, how did they do that, you know, type thing, and oh, movie special effects are so funny.

1084
01:15:42,617 --> 01:15:44,898
[SPEAKER_22]: Like in the first... Like the chick that got turned into a cockroach.

1085
01:15:45,178 --> 01:15:48,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I'm thinking from the very first Final Destination, that chick that gets hit by the bus.

1086
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:50,361
[SPEAKER_02]: I laughed so fucking hard.

1087
01:15:50,381 --> 01:15:50,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway...

1088
01:15:53,712 --> 01:15:54,213
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, moving on.

1089
01:15:54,233 --> 01:15:54,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to the chat room.

1090
01:15:55,194 --> 01:15:56,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to the chat room, my friends.

1091
01:15:56,155 --> 01:15:56,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

1092
01:15:59,278 --> 01:15:59,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Whack-whack.

1093
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you to chat cookie.

1094
01:16:04,471 --> 01:16:05,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck the Raiders, they suck.

1095
01:16:05,992 --> 01:16:10,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck the UC Davis IT people for taking two weeks to fix the connection in the dorm.

1096
01:16:10,915 --> 01:16:13,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck the fact that I still haven't played 2DX Iscandia yet.

1097
01:16:13,497 --> 01:16:18,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck the fact that no one responded to my post in Comp Sci Class News Group asking for a program partner.

1098
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:21,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a partner so I can finish my next program by Wednesday.

1099
01:16:21,562 --> 01:16:25,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And fuck sexual frustration, especially at 18 and away at college and a virgin.

1100
01:16:25,825 --> 01:16:26,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Aww.

1101
01:16:26,886 --> 01:16:28,106
[SPEAKER_18]: Poor baby.

1102
01:16:28,126 --> 01:16:28,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Loki.

1103
01:16:28,707 --> 01:16:30,848
[SPEAKER_03]: That's information you don't want to give out on the air.

1104
01:16:30,928 --> 01:16:33,010
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like being hungry in a fast food joint.

1105
01:16:34,139 --> 01:16:34,920
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, exactly.

1106
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:39,342
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't order from the menu, there's something wrong there.

1107
01:16:39,803 --> 01:16:40,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you know what?

1108
01:16:41,724 --> 01:16:45,906
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to get laid... But see, the thing is, he has a girlfriend who's saving herself.

1109
01:16:45,926 --> 01:16:47,447
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in love and all this stuff, you know.

1110
01:16:47,928 --> 01:16:53,912
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we can't exactly just go take him to a bar, get him drunk, and get the little chick drunk and say, okay, here's the bed.

1111
01:16:54,112 --> 01:16:55,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard this story before, too.

1112
01:16:55,713 --> 01:16:56,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1113
01:16:56,293 --> 01:16:58,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the game Road Trip, it had something very similar.

1114
01:16:59,275 --> 01:17:02,197
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in love, you know, they're way at college...

1115
01:17:02,857 --> 01:17:08,662
[SPEAKER_03]: and I believe, uh, what was it, uh, I forget his name, but anyways, it's like, your penis will never forgive you.

1116
01:17:08,723 --> 01:17:12,006
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do not take this opportunity.

1117
01:17:12,866 --> 01:17:15,048
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna pack up my balls and leave.

1118
01:17:15,068 --> 01:17:20,373
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay, there's plenty of pussy wanting to be a pussy there, we call it.

1119
01:17:20,393 --> 01:17:20,974
[SPEAKER_34]: Take it there.

1120
01:17:22,885 --> 01:17:25,366
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to get laid, we will get you laid.

1121
01:17:25,706 --> 01:17:27,067
[SPEAKER_02]: It just won't be your girlfriend.

1122
01:17:27,127 --> 01:17:27,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1123
01:17:27,827 --> 01:17:31,889
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure she's a nice lady, but if she ain't going to open the legs, she ain't going to get in.

1124
01:17:31,909 --> 01:17:32,570
[SPEAKER_02]: In defense.

1125
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:32,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1126
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:33,190
[SPEAKER_02]: No defense.

1127
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:33,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Overruled.

1128
01:17:43,684 --> 01:17:44,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Objection!

1129
01:17:46,946 --> 01:17:48,686
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that it's admirable.

1130
01:17:49,727 --> 01:17:51,928
[SPEAKER_21]: You think that it's admirable?

1131
01:17:52,108 --> 01:17:52,328
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1132
01:17:52,928 --> 01:17:54,729
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the thing, though.

1133
01:17:54,809 --> 01:17:58,811
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're not going to because you're not mean.

1134
01:17:58,831 --> 01:17:59,752
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's what I say.

1135
01:18:01,192 --> 01:18:02,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure she's a wonderful girl.

1136
01:18:03,373 --> 01:18:06,574
[SPEAKER_02]: All the girls I dated in high school were saving themselves for marriage, too.

1137
01:18:06,895 --> 01:18:09,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to point out, I turned out gay.

1138
01:18:09,436 --> 01:18:10,376
[SPEAKER_02]: So be careful.

1139
01:18:10,556 --> 01:18:11,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't make Ryan gay.

1140
01:18:11,796 --> 01:18:12,497
[SPEAKER_02]: He won't like it.

1141
01:18:12,617 --> 01:18:15,078
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this might have been popular back in the 90s.

1142
01:18:15,218 --> 01:18:15,378
[SPEAKER_03]: 1890s?

1143
01:18:15,478 --> 01:18:17,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, not today.

1144
01:18:17,779 --> 01:18:19,620
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, hello, get with the times here.

1145
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:20,880
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't do that shit no more.

1146
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:21,960
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they do, they're lying.

1147
01:18:22,961 --> 01:18:25,442
[SPEAKER_20]: For the record, for the record, okay.

1148
01:18:27,038 --> 01:18:35,522
[SPEAKER_22]: I said that I was going to save myself for the one person who I was going to spend the rest of my life with, and I did, because I'm going to marry Dan.

1149
01:18:36,843 --> 01:18:40,805
[SPEAKER_22]: And so there are people with morals in this world.

1150
01:18:40,925 --> 01:18:45,127
[SPEAKER_17]: Screw morals, order some GHB online, that'll get you laid real quick.

1151
01:18:45,648 --> 01:18:47,649
[SPEAKER_22]: Although I'm currently living in San Francisco.

1152
01:18:47,729 --> 01:18:48,769
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what it boils down to.

1153
01:18:51,545 --> 01:18:54,387
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to put out for the horny 18 year old.

1154
01:18:54,607 --> 01:19:03,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen lady, when you're 35 and you're at your sexual peak and no guy's going to have sex with you, don't come whining to us.

1155
01:19:09,226 --> 01:19:11,967
[SPEAKER_03]: You may think that, but no, that ain't gonna happen.

1156
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:18,168
[SPEAKER_03]: By then, by then it's like this, okay, you're trying, you're trying, you're trying, oh, fuck it, you know, I give up, I'm gonna go build a car.

1157
01:19:18,568 --> 01:19:21,328
[SPEAKER_03]: And then she's like, I want you now, come on.

1158
01:19:21,348 --> 01:19:24,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm trying to fucking build my car, what the fuck are you trying to do?

1159
01:19:24,249 --> 01:19:25,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to get, trying to have sex with me?

1160
01:19:25,829 --> 01:19:26,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Where were you 20 years ago?

1161
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:27,770
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

1162
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:29,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you like it now, huh?

1163
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:31,911
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's what boils down to right there.

1164
01:19:32,331 --> 01:19:34,111
[SPEAKER_33]: Shoes on the other hand now, isn't it?

1165
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:41,154
[SPEAKER_21]: These guys are deplorable.

1166
01:19:41,334 --> 01:19:42,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know the meaning of the word.

1167
01:19:44,056 --> 01:19:45,117
[SPEAKER_20]: Rob, go to dictionary.com.

1168
01:19:45,137 --> 01:19:47,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, okay, I'm going to dictionary.com right now.

1169
01:19:47,399 --> 01:19:51,522
[SPEAKER_20]: I will define the word deplorable for you thanks to dictionary.com.

1170
01:19:51,603 --> 01:19:52,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you know what?

1171
01:19:52,824 --> 01:19:56,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Lab's FU has just stopped the FU's of the Week segment while we look this stuff up.

1172
01:19:57,347 --> 01:19:58,348
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll resume it in a minute.

1173
01:19:58,869 --> 01:19:59,849
[SPEAKER_02]: D-L-O-R-A-B-L-E

1174
01:20:04,787 --> 01:20:05,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1175
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:09,989
[SPEAKER_22]: Get top ten most popular... Mortivere, condemnation, or reproach.

1176
01:20:10,529 --> 01:20:11,910
[SPEAKER_22]: Lamentable, woeful.

1177
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:13,550
[SPEAKER_22]: Wretched, bad.

1178
01:20:14,811 --> 01:20:16,852
[SPEAKER_22]: As in, damn you suck!

1179
01:20:19,393 --> 01:20:20,113
[SPEAKER_22]: Deplorable.

1180
01:20:20,253 --> 01:20:22,034
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the fourth definition there, I think.

1181
01:20:22,394 --> 01:20:24,735
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, the dictionary according to Jamie.

1182
01:20:26,296 --> 01:20:27,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, are we ready to resume the FUs of the week?

1183
01:20:27,936 --> 01:20:29,457
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys all stop talking about sex now...

1184
01:20:34,562 --> 01:20:37,124
[SPEAKER_22]: You got that?

1185
01:20:37,144 --> 01:20:38,465
[SPEAKER_22]: Dick is in, go choke on life.

1186
01:20:40,486 --> 01:20:44,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, Brad's giving me head, life on air.

1187
01:20:45,009 --> 01:20:45,549
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1188
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:47,191
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good radio.

1189
01:20:47,231 --> 01:20:48,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet our radios would go up.

1190
01:20:48,391 --> 01:20:49,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, that's what we need to do.

1191
01:20:49,832 --> 01:20:50,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we've done drunk.

1192
01:20:51,559 --> 01:20:54,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we need to have the sex show, where we have people get laved live on air.

1193
01:20:55,262 --> 01:20:56,242
[SPEAKER_22]: I wouldn't be here for that.

1194
01:20:56,422 --> 01:20:56,963
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll be at home.

1195
01:20:57,023 --> 01:21:00,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll have the violence show, where we kill something.

1196
01:21:00,885 --> 01:21:03,407
[SPEAKER_21]: Where I take a sledgehammer and go chasing after a bunny.

1197
01:21:04,628 --> 01:21:05,709
[SPEAKER_21]: No bunnies!

1198
01:21:05,809 --> 01:21:06,629
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't kill bunnies!

1199
01:21:06,649 --> 01:21:07,290
[SPEAKER_21]: Sweet!

1200
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:09,351
[SPEAKER_21]: Bunnies are cute!

1201
01:21:09,771 --> 01:21:11,713
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are the name of Oolong!

1202
01:21:14,515 --> 01:21:16,196
[SPEAKER_23]: We know what happened to Oolong.

1203
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:18,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's a pancake, it's a target.

1204
01:21:19,192 --> 01:21:20,713
[SPEAKER_09]: No!

1205
01:21:21,934 --> 01:21:22,955
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys are awful.

1206
01:21:23,575 --> 01:21:24,856
[SPEAKER_21]: Rob, I like bunnies too.

1207
01:21:25,657 --> 01:21:26,338
[SPEAKER_02]: For dinner!

1208
01:21:26,858 --> 01:21:27,899
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are awful.

1209
01:21:27,919 --> 01:21:29,060
[SPEAKER_21]: No, Rob's gonna get a bunny.

1210
01:21:30,221 --> 01:21:31,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna get a bunny.

1211
01:21:32,002 --> 01:21:34,464
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna poop little round things all over your house.

1212
01:21:34,745 --> 01:21:36,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I only eat the cute animals.

1213
01:21:36,066 --> 01:21:37,367
[SPEAKER_02]: You can potty train your bunny.

1214
01:21:37,667 --> 01:21:39,969
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm an otter!

1215
01:21:40,029 --> 01:21:41,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we get back to the chatroom FUs, please?

1216
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:42,811
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, you don't have to get on here.

1217
01:21:43,132 --> 01:21:43,532
[SPEAKER_19]: What are you?

1218
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:44,573
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm a cow!

1219
01:21:44,813 --> 01:21:45,494
[SPEAKER_19]: Get on the train!

1220
01:21:46,991 --> 01:21:47,531
Dennis Leary.

1221
01:21:48,532 --> 01:21:49,232
[SPEAKER_34]: Moving on.

1222
01:21:51,133 --> 01:21:52,573
[SPEAKER_19]: Just bring out a whole cow.

1223
01:21:52,854 --> 01:21:55,655
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll cobra off what I want and ride the rest home.

1224
01:21:57,816 --> 01:21:58,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dennis Leary.

1225
01:22:00,797 --> 01:22:04,859
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya says, a mammoth king-sized FU to the sapphire worm.

1226
01:22:06,818 --> 01:22:07,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is that?

1227
01:22:07,338 --> 01:22:08,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Slow it down.

1228
01:22:08,919 --> 01:22:10,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, oh, okay.

1229
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:19,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, because he, like, isn't able to, uh... I think he wasn't able to connect to the station for a while or something.

1230
01:22:19,847 --> 01:22:23,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Dwayne says, F you to football.

1231
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:27,712
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the new Stepmania build with exit bugs and background change bugs.

1232
01:22:28,613 --> 01:22:30,454
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to himself with big black cocks.

1233
01:22:30,714 --> 01:22:35,917
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to everyone who doesn't like his so-called freestyle double routine to the whistle song complete with pelvic thrusts on freezes.

1234
01:22:36,038 --> 01:22:36,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

1235
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:39,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Blackwing, whatever, why don't you go cry me a river?

1236
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:39,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Blow me a crap?

1237
01:22:39,741 --> 01:22:40,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Get over it, guys.

1238
01:22:40,421 --> 01:22:41,662
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the other cliche.

1239
01:22:41,682 --> 01:22:43,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Maple... Maple... Says... Excuse me.

1240
01:22:43,203 --> 01:22:43,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Maple says... What?

1241
01:23:01,670 --> 01:23:02,290
[SPEAKER_23]: Ask the Mormon.

1242
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:03,170
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1243
01:23:03,771 --> 01:23:04,731
[SPEAKER_23]: Just look at me.

1244
01:23:04,831 --> 01:23:05,751
[SPEAKER_23]: I am Mormon.

1245
01:23:05,791 --> 01:23:07,332
[SPEAKER_23]: Charge I. I must be God.

1246
01:23:07,672 --> 01:23:09,192
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't touch my nipples.

1247
01:23:09,712 --> 01:23:11,393
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if this is St.

1248
01:23:11,413 --> 01:23:13,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Patrick's Day, but if you were in St.

1249
01:23:13,513 --> 01:23:15,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Patrick's Day, I don't know.

1250
01:23:15,374 --> 01:23:18,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in Ireland, it's a lot more orange than orange.

1251
01:23:18,715 --> 01:23:23,436
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would actually remember an orange whoever pinched me that kicked the ball.

1252
01:23:23,456 --> 01:23:27,417
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'd be like, excuse me, this is the... Anyway, back to the movie here.

1253
01:23:28,516 --> 01:23:29,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I read Maples F you now?

1254
01:23:29,877 --> 01:23:30,638
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I will.

1255
01:23:31,198 --> 01:23:31,618
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay.

1256
01:23:32,139 --> 01:23:32,459
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to?

1257
01:23:32,499 --> 01:23:32,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

1258
01:23:33,179 --> 01:23:33,860
[SPEAKER_02]: No, now you're good.

1259
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:34,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck is fuck you.

1260
01:23:36,687 --> 01:23:44,613
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you to my sickness, making me sleep a huge amount of hours, and missing the Super Bowl.

1261
01:23:44,633 --> 01:23:46,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you didn't miss anything.

1262
01:23:46,514 --> 01:23:48,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Raiders got fucked in the ass and they played a Matrix trailer.

1263
01:23:48,936 --> 01:23:49,757
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the Super Bowl.

1264
01:23:49,917 --> 01:23:51,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are the football games called bowls?

1265
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:53,800
[SPEAKER_09]: You should save those for, like, bowling.

1266
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:54,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a fruit bowl?

1267
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:55,941
[SPEAKER_09]: You should save those for bowling.

1268
01:23:55,961 --> 01:23:56,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah!

1269
01:23:56,121 --> 01:23:56,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Clow bowling!

1270
01:23:56,742 --> 01:23:57,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Clow bowling.

1271
01:24:01,292 --> 01:24:01,934
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Google.

1272
01:24:02,014 --> 01:24:03,397
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay, we'll go Google.

1273
01:24:03,958 --> 01:24:06,023
[SPEAKER_34]: Orange Lounge goes to Coldwell.

1274
01:24:06,043 --> 01:24:07,487
[SPEAKER_34]: Without you listeners.

1275
01:24:07,948 --> 01:24:08,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, without you listeners.

1276
01:24:08,930 --> 01:24:09,411
[SPEAKER_02]: It's private.

1277
01:24:09,431 --> 01:24:09,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1278
01:24:12,411 --> 01:24:23,093
[SPEAKER_02]: DDRAngel says, my one F you for this week goes to people who are your best friends who are supposed to support you in your decisions no matter what, but they end up disagreeing with you and making you feel shitty, even though you're making a decision you believe in.

1279
01:24:23,814 --> 01:24:24,914
[SPEAKER_18]: I have something to say about that.

1280
01:24:25,014 --> 01:24:25,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1281
01:24:26,034 --> 01:24:31,475
[SPEAKER_22]: If a person isn't your friend and they don't listen to what you're doing, it's going to end up hurting you in the long run.

1282
01:24:32,016 --> 01:24:34,256
[SPEAKER_22]: They are a better friend than not supporting you.

1283
01:24:34,276 --> 01:24:34,796
[SPEAKER_20]: It's, you know...

1284
01:24:39,456 --> 01:24:50,966
[SPEAKER_18]: It takes courage to stand up to your enemy, and more courage to stand up to your enemy.

1285
01:24:51,087 --> 01:25:03,918
[SPEAKER_22]: And if your friend sees something, or has experience like that, that, you know, is going to say that this experience that you're going through right now is going to come back and bite you in the ass, you better listen to your friend's advice.

1286
01:25:05,257 --> 01:25:07,298
[SPEAKER_22]: Especially if that person has the experience to know us.

1287
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:10,981
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't discount your friend just because they're showing a little bit of concern for you, okay?

1288
01:25:11,601 --> 01:25:13,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless they're drunk, then don't listen to them.

1289
01:25:13,182 --> 01:25:14,563
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, please don't listen to them.

1290
01:25:14,583 --> 01:25:19,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, this orange lounge suddenly got deep.

1291
01:25:20,707 --> 01:25:28,214
[SPEAKER_22]: And don't listen to them when they say that some girl likes you, because even though they may be their best friend and they may know them for like years, they're wrong and they like you.

1292
01:25:47,771 --> 01:25:48,732
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1293
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:23,605
[SPEAKER_22]: If they've had experience that maybe something that you're going through right now isn't necessarily something that might be good for you, if they see potential harm in what you're doing, you'd best appreciate that kind of advice because it takes a lot of bravery to tell your friends, I don't think what you're doing is the right thing.

1294
01:26:23,965 --> 01:26:28,846
[SPEAKER_22]: It takes a shallow person to just agree with everything just because they want to keep you as a friend.

1295
01:26:29,526 --> 01:26:33,789
[SPEAKER_22]: It takes a really strong person to say, you know, I disagree with you, and this is why.

1296
01:26:34,809 --> 01:26:36,450
[SPEAKER_22]: So, that's all it is.

1297
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:38,772
[SPEAKER_22]: You just have to keep an open mind toward what your friends tell you.

1298
01:26:40,713 --> 01:26:41,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1299
01:26:41,753 --> 01:26:46,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Although Angel says she was drunk, so... Okay, if the person was drunk, then just screw it.

1300
01:26:48,397 --> 01:26:50,739
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, we appreciated deep thoughts with Jamie.

1301
01:26:51,099 --> 01:26:52,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Now back to the pornography chat.

1302
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:52,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1303
01:26:55,157 --> 01:27:03,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Chubbs says, I can't think of any FUs, so FU to Jack in the Box again for taking away the 99 cent Westerner.

1304
01:27:03,964 --> 01:27:05,385
[SPEAKER_02]: How was his FU last week?

1305
01:27:06,906 --> 01:27:07,187
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1306
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:14,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Stresso wants to get laid live on air, so he's volunteering to come down for that show.

1307
01:27:15,013 --> 01:27:15,313
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1308
01:27:19,959 --> 01:27:21,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat Cookie says, Fuck you, Black Lab.

1309
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:23,880
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just jealous of my chocolate chips.

1310
01:27:24,461 --> 01:27:28,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I want to send out an FU to everyone that's envious of my sweet perfections.

1311
01:27:30,262 --> 01:27:31,063
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a robot.

1312
01:27:33,403 --> 01:27:37,845
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, 23rd Bagus has a special little FU this week.

1313
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:43,806
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm even giving him his own song because he begged and pleaded enough and I just wanted him to stop begging because it was getting sad.

1314
01:27:43,886 --> 01:27:45,587
[SPEAKER_02]: So, he's saying...

1315
01:27:46,792 --> 01:27:48,453
[SPEAKER_02]: My life is so full of bliss.

1316
01:27:48,573 --> 01:27:49,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no F you for the week.

1317
01:27:50,254 --> 01:27:51,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, however, have something different.

1318
01:27:51,996 --> 01:27:54,357
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to send a love you to DGR Angel.

1319
01:27:54,758 --> 01:27:56,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you be my Bimani girl?

1320
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:58,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just that, something deeper.

1321
01:27:59,101 --> 01:28:01,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you and I'm willing to make sure we are together and forever.

1322
01:28:02,083 --> 01:28:03,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the song, get it?

1323
01:28:03,564 --> 01:28:04,184
[SPEAKER_02]: How about you?

1324
01:28:04,244 --> 01:28:06,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you stay with me forever?

1325
01:28:07,226 --> 01:28:07,626
[SPEAKER_16]: That was cute.

1326
01:28:10,179 --> 01:28:13,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many serious moments here on Horse Lounge Radio.

1327
01:28:15,743 --> 01:28:19,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And people getting laid, and it's not me, and that makes me cry.

1328
01:28:21,768 --> 01:28:24,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, but I am getting a massage, so maybe I like wallowing in my pity here.

1329
01:28:29,034 --> 01:28:29,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you crying?

1330
01:28:30,275 --> 01:28:31,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, stop it, go give her a massage.

1331
01:28:32,416 --> 01:28:32,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes she does.

1332
01:28:37,984 --> 01:28:38,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Touch me and I'll break your finger.

1333
01:29:06,166 --> 01:29:07,006
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know what?

1334
01:29:07,026 --> 01:29:09,788
[SPEAKER_03]: We never did get the answer here.

1335
01:29:10,308 --> 01:29:14,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

1336
01:29:17,753 --> 01:29:18,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1337
01:29:19,233 --> 01:29:21,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet it went to private message, tee-hee.

1338
01:29:22,042 --> 01:29:23,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's not fair!

1339
01:29:24,403 --> 01:29:25,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, we got big hugs.

1340
01:29:26,284 --> 01:29:26,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Big hugs.

1341
01:29:27,505 --> 01:29:29,286
[SPEAKER_02]: And oh my god, OMG.

1342
01:29:29,586 --> 01:29:30,426
[SPEAKER_02]: We got an OMG!

1343
01:29:31,047 --> 01:29:31,527
[SPEAKER_11]: OMG!

1344
01:29:32,528 --> 01:29:32,808
[SPEAKER_02]: OMG!

1345
01:29:33,288 --> 01:29:33,808
[SPEAKER_02]: OMG!

1346
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:34,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know me.

1347
01:29:35,369 --> 01:29:35,649
[SPEAKER_02]: OMG!

1348
01:29:35,669 --> 01:29:37,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1349
01:29:37,990 --> 01:29:38,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

1350
01:29:38,911 --> 01:29:39,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1351
01:29:40,052 --> 01:29:41,973
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm checking some... You down with entropy?

1352
01:29:46,075 --> 01:29:47,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's check the mailboxes.

1353
01:29:47,275 --> 01:29:47,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to check the mail.

1354
01:29:52,027 --> 01:29:55,474
[SPEAKER_02]: USFVB says, being here during this makes me feel gay.

1355
01:29:57,739 --> 01:29:59,242
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's Jamie's town that makes you gay.

1356
01:29:59,302 --> 01:30:00,645
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Orange Lodge.

1357
01:30:04,507 --> 01:30:06,628
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Angel wants me to say what she said in chat.

1358
01:30:06,648 --> 01:30:07,148
[SPEAKER_02]: I already did.

1359
01:30:07,408 --> 01:30:07,768
[SPEAKER_02]: OMG.

1360
01:30:08,748 --> 01:30:08,969
[SPEAKER_19]: Omg.

1361
01:30:09,349 --> 01:30:10,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay, I didn't read the first part.

1362
01:30:10,789 --> 01:30:13,470
[SPEAKER_02]: She caution drops to the ground in shock for a few moments.

1363
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:17,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Then she finds the energy to get up and hugs Magus.

1364
01:30:17,211 --> 01:30:17,551
[SPEAKER_02]: OMG.

1365
01:30:18,151 --> 01:30:20,992
[SPEAKER_19]: OMG, OMG, OMG, OMG, OMG, OMG.

1366
01:30:22,453 --> 01:30:23,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take another quick break.

1367
01:30:23,393 --> 01:30:25,314
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back with this week's cage match.

1368
01:30:26,974 --> 01:30:27,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because.

1369
01:30:28,135 --> 01:30:30,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Word.

1370
01:30:30,697 --> 01:30:35,221
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be right back after this quick little break featuring... Me breaking stuff.

1371
01:30:36,442 --> 01:30:37,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Breaking stuff.

1372
01:30:37,863 --> 01:30:40,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And a song from Dance Mania.

1373
01:30:41,025 --> 01:30:43,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because we feel like playing something from Dance Mania.

1374
01:30:43,787 --> 01:30:45,809
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to play some booty Dance Mania?

1375
01:30:46,069 --> 01:30:46,469
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1376
01:30:46,830 --> 01:30:50,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, how about... I know I've got one.

1377
01:30:50,572 --> 01:30:51,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I'm trying to find it.

1378
01:30:51,853 --> 01:30:52,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.

1379
01:30:52,214 --> 01:30:53,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, some booty Dance Mania.

1380
01:30:53,835 --> 01:30:54,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you go.

1381
01:30:54,576 --> 01:30:54,936
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back.

1382
01:33:25,109 --> 01:33:26,154
Blow my whistle baby

1383
01:34:53,852 --> 01:34:55,094
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you for watching!

1384
01:35:41,002 --> 01:35:42,443
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

1385
01:36:07,273 --> 01:36:08,774
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching.

[SPEAKER_13]: Please subscribe to my channel.

1387
01:36:38,394 --> 01:36:39,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching

1388
01:36:54,557 --> 01:36:58,118
[SPEAKER_01]: The following bit of randomness has been brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

1389
01:37:12,631 --> 01:37:12,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi!

1390
01:37:14,071 --> 01:37:15,792
[SPEAKER_02]: We almost had a... Ask Mike.

1391
01:37:16,792 --> 01:37:17,652
[SPEAKER_22]: My God, Rob.

1392
01:37:17,693 --> 01:37:18,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I was sitting on the mic, my bad.

1393
01:37:18,953 --> 01:37:19,613
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm going to fart.

1394
01:37:19,693 --> 01:37:20,073
[SPEAKER_34]: Sorry.

1395
01:37:20,093 --> 01:37:20,793
[SPEAKER_34]: Sorry.

1396
01:37:21,013 --> 01:37:22,854
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to fuck you.

1397
01:37:23,654 --> 01:37:26,575
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay, back to the fuck you's of the week.

1398
01:37:26,615 --> 01:37:29,136
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck you to the United States government and our president.

1399
01:37:30,552 --> 01:37:40,561
[SPEAKER_22]: for this whole stupid decision about attacking Iraq and all that, because this is only really for a very personal reason.

1400
01:37:40,581 --> 01:37:46,687
[SPEAKER_22]: My brother is a Marine, and he has to go to Kuwait next month.

1401
01:37:46,707 --> 01:37:47,748
[SPEAKER_22]: So, fuck all of it.

1402
01:37:49,469 --> 01:37:49,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

1403
01:37:50,089 --> 01:37:55,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't understand when there's all these countries that are against the war.

1404
01:37:56,372 --> 01:37:57,213
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

1405
01:37:57,253 --> 01:37:58,153
[SPEAKER_02]: He ain't popular with me.

1406
01:37:58,193 --> 01:38:00,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I wouldn't have ever voted for the guy in the first place.

1407
01:38:00,294 --> 01:38:01,295
[SPEAKER_22]: You couldn't vote for him anyway.

1408
01:38:01,355 --> 01:38:02,095
[SPEAKER_22]: I voted Green Party.

1409
01:38:02,876 --> 01:38:03,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.

1410
01:38:03,816 --> 01:38:07,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the whole war is stupid, and I think Bush is just asking for trouble, and he's not going to get reelected.

1411
01:38:08,018 --> 01:38:08,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I voted Donald Duck.

1412
01:38:10,879 --> 01:38:11,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Donald Duck in 2004.

1413
01:38:15,403 --> 01:38:18,186
[SPEAKER_22]: I think when his reelection comes up, we should all vote for Strong Bad.

1414
01:38:19,387 --> 01:38:20,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we'll vote for Strong Bad, that's fine.

1415
01:38:21,349 --> 01:38:22,089
[SPEAKER_22]: From Homestar Runner.

1416
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:28,795
[SPEAKER_22]: Everybody go to homestarrunner.com after the show and read the Strong Bad email.

1417
01:38:29,075 --> 01:38:29,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1418
01:38:29,896 --> 01:38:34,000
[SPEAKER_02]: We've said our piece because we don't want to turn this into a completely political show.

1419
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:37,723
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to send him a letter that says, fuck you right in your ear because your ass ain't good enough.

1420
01:38:40,313 --> 01:38:42,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're not having a political debate, that's it.

1421
01:38:42,574 --> 01:38:45,414
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got personal reasons for being against it, so that's that.

1422
01:38:46,475 --> 01:38:47,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on.

1423
01:38:50,976 --> 01:38:52,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, what are we moving on to?

1424
01:38:52,156 --> 01:38:52,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, the cage match.

1425
01:38:52,836 --> 01:38:55,817
[SPEAKER_22]: By the way, I don't give a shit about politics, so there.

1426
01:38:57,337 --> 01:38:58,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, moving on.

1427
01:38:58,978 --> 01:39:01,138
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk cage match politics right now.

1428
01:39:01,198 --> 01:39:03,059
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the politics that are important on this show right now.

1429
01:39:06,030 --> 01:39:06,410
[SPEAKER_02]: We could.

1430
01:39:06,430 --> 01:39:07,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have anything actual?

1431
01:39:07,511 --> 01:39:08,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Sim update.

1432
01:39:08,032 --> 01:39:08,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, give us a sim update.

1433
01:39:09,073 --> 01:39:10,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get the show back on track.

1434
01:39:10,914 --> 01:39:11,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay!

1435
01:39:11,855 --> 01:39:12,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay!

1436
01:39:12,916 --> 01:39:14,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1437
01:39:14,998 --> 01:39:20,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Earlier this week, well, actually, a couple of websites are going through a couple of changes.

1438
01:39:21,603 --> 01:39:28,289
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a big Bomani-style bitch fest going on, and they're redoing some stuff.

1439
01:39:29,890 --> 01:39:32,492
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't like the fact that people were leeching files off their site.

1440
01:39:33,613 --> 01:39:39,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, you don't mean Bomani Style, you mean, well, hold on, keep going, never mind, I've got to get something cute up here.

1441
01:39:39,978 --> 01:39:48,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah, other than that, DDR Mania X, they had a whole site relaunched with a brand new design to it, so it's kind of pretty.

1442
01:39:49,144 --> 01:39:51,366
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's pretty cool, they have that going on.

1443
01:39:52,166 --> 01:39:59,511
[SPEAKER_03]: See, other than that, Bomani Style is releasing brand new, well, actually, they're the same DDR Extreme files, but now they have backgrounds in them.

1444
01:40:00,032 --> 01:40:00,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Woohoo!

1445
01:40:00,979 --> 01:40:13,880
[SPEAKER_03]: and so those will be coming up pretty soon they have like three up right now and let's see other than that here let me cut you off for just a second because I wanted to say it's not Bomani style it's

1446
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:25,741
[SPEAKER_02]: The Money Style, because goddamn, they do everything for this community.

1447
01:40:26,061 --> 01:40:29,462
[SPEAKER_02]: They bend over backwards and they died on the cross for this community.

1448
01:40:40,485 --> 01:40:43,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to put the announcer files up on your site?

1449
01:40:43,468 --> 01:40:44,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Chatroom's wondering.

1450
01:41:06,129 --> 01:41:10,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I am, and I've ripped the announcer files from DDR Extreme with, uh, yeah!

1451
01:41:11,191 --> 01:41:12,331
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got that on there, too.

1452
01:41:12,691 --> 01:41:17,453
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not slamming on any other websites, by the way, but just, you know, the whole Jesus Complex.

1453
01:41:17,613 --> 01:41:18,354
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the internet.

1454
01:41:18,414 --> 01:41:19,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody leeches from everybody.

1455
01:41:19,754 --> 01:41:20,854
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole concept.

1456
01:41:21,275 --> 01:41:22,215
[SPEAKER_02]: God, if you don't...

1457
01:41:22,850 --> 01:41:25,891
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't want people to be doing it, don't post it.

1458
01:41:26,011 --> 01:41:27,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it doesn't make sense, you guys.

1459
01:41:28,072 --> 01:41:28,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop.

1460
01:41:28,933 --> 01:41:29,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Be nice.

1461
01:41:29,653 --> 01:41:30,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Be nice to each other.

1462
01:41:30,493 --> 01:41:31,094
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all we want.

1463
01:41:31,254 --> 01:41:32,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's another thing.

1464
01:41:32,394 --> 01:41:34,315
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, like, wondering why people are turned away from the site.

1465
01:41:34,335 --> 01:41:34,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's see.

1466
01:41:34,695 --> 01:41:36,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some of your mods that they got to slip.

1467
01:41:36,776 --> 01:41:37,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Slip some mod on that site.

1468
01:41:38,197 --> 01:41:40,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get into personally bashing people on this show.

1469
01:41:40,938 --> 01:41:42,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, he had some pretty funny comments.

1470
01:41:42,439 --> 01:41:43,339
[SPEAKER_03]: I like reading his stuff.

1471
01:41:43,399 --> 01:41:46,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when he's ripping on stupid people, that's hilarious.

1472
01:41:47,241 --> 01:41:47,681
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um...

1473
01:41:48,161 --> 01:41:51,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, see, other than that, let's see some stuff I forgot last week.

1474
01:41:51,164 --> 01:42:00,694
[SPEAKER_03]: There was this, um, um, it was a DDR, sort of Amani-related, uh, DDR, like, e-magazine type thing that went out.

1475
01:42:00,714 --> 01:42:02,876
[SPEAKER_03]: It had some pretty funny stuff.

1476
01:42:03,577 --> 01:42:07,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to print it out, but it was on my zip drive, so unfortunately I couldn't do that.

1477
01:42:07,341 --> 01:42:09,563
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of alright, made by some Canadians, I think.

1478
01:42:11,185 --> 01:42:26,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, let's see, aside from all that stuff, um, oh, DWI Insanity, they just released Easy to Dancer songs, a whole pack of those that are DWIs now, so go check those out, those are pretty cool.

1479
01:42:26,535 --> 01:42:29,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Links on DDR Maniacs if you want to check that out.

1480
01:42:29,898 --> 01:42:36,262
[SPEAKER_03]: And always just, you know, keep watching their forums, there's going to be, you know, files to release and whatnot.

1481
01:42:36,883 --> 01:42:36,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

1482
01:42:37,683 --> 01:42:43,228
[SPEAKER_03]: See, DDR East Coast Invasion is going to be doing another Tourney Mix, I'm sure, Tourney Mix 4.

1483
01:42:43,568 --> 01:42:46,110
[SPEAKER_03]: They're talking about doing one every three months, I think.

1484
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:48,592
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'd probably put it in April.

1485
01:42:49,293 --> 01:42:56,939
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're also running a contest right now where if you... It's a B-Mani music remixing contest.

1486
01:42:56,999 --> 01:42:58,580
[SPEAKER_03]: You just pick songs, remix them.

1487
01:42:58,981 --> 01:43:03,204
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to be somewhere from one and a half minutes to, I believe, four minutes in length.

1488
01:43:03,604 --> 01:43:03,744
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

1489
01:43:10,467 --> 01:43:13,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Lab wants to know, when is there going to be a DDR sim for Max, goddammit?

1490
01:43:14,609 --> 01:43:15,109
[SPEAKER_03]: For what?

1491
01:43:15,469 --> 01:43:16,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Max, Macintoshes.

1492
01:43:17,610 --> 01:43:18,170
[SPEAKER_03]: For Max?

1493
01:43:18,891 --> 01:43:21,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well there sort of is right now, there's um...

1494
01:43:23,059 --> 01:43:26,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit, now I remember what it was called.

1495
01:43:26,322 --> 01:43:28,223
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one that was for multiple platforms.

1496
01:43:28,784 --> 01:43:34,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it was Pi DDR, but there was one that was for multiple platforms that I posted a long time ago.

1497
01:43:35,449 --> 01:43:37,230
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, I don't know.

1498
01:43:38,271 --> 01:43:38,511
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1499
01:43:38,551 --> 01:43:39,151
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just maxed it.

1500
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:40,472
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they don't make Sims for him.

1501
01:43:40,793 --> 01:43:43,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, get out of his lap, man!

1502
01:43:44,996 --> 01:43:47,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm giving him a lap dance during the show.

1503
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:55,594
[SPEAKER_03]: And no news on Feet of Fury, it's supposed to be finished in March, I think.

1504
01:43:55,634 --> 01:43:58,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Feet is Fury.

1505
01:44:00,220 --> 01:44:00,961
Yeah!

1506
01:44:00,981 --> 01:44:04,546
[SPEAKER_22]: I know the game's so bad it makes you grow up into a little lizard.

1507
01:44:04,566 --> 01:44:04,926
What Fury?

1508
01:44:10,132 --> 01:44:17,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Lab wanted me to ask if you guys were interested in doing... There's actually some new programming coming to Orange Lounge in the very new future.

1509
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:21,965
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the Johnny the Homicidal Maniac special, the drama that's going to be... When's that finished?

1510
01:44:21,985 --> 01:44:24,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we know when that's going to be finished?

1511
01:44:24,227 --> 01:44:24,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel sick.

1512
01:44:24,728 --> 01:44:24,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1513
01:44:25,048 --> 01:44:26,029
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't really know.

1514
01:44:26,069 --> 01:44:26,710
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't heard from her.

1515
01:44:26,750 --> 01:44:29,673
[SPEAKER_22]: I actually have to re-record my lines for the Psychic Lady.

1516
01:44:29,693 --> 01:44:30,334
[SPEAKER_22]: Ah, okay.

1517
01:44:30,894 --> 01:44:37,659
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be having a new music show coming that's going to be debuting soon as soon as I get the list from you guys.

1518
01:44:37,699 --> 01:44:39,080
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't even told Loki about it yet.

1519
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:43,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I'm always on loop, both at work and life and everything.

1520
01:44:44,023 --> 01:44:46,464
[SPEAKER_02]: But you guys will be sending me these.

1521
01:44:46,484 --> 01:44:48,025
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have a long version program.

1522
01:44:48,085 --> 01:44:51,728
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had a lot of requests to play more long version Bomani musics.

1523
01:44:52,168 --> 01:44:55,030
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have a Bomani music block at some point.

1524
01:44:55,050 --> 01:45:03,657
[SPEAKER_02]: We might do it at a certain time every day for like an hour, but just like some long versions because we've had some requests to play more long stuff on Orange Moms Radio.

1525
01:45:03,677 --> 01:45:05,819
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do long versions of your favorite Bomani songs.

1526
01:45:06,659 --> 01:45:07,280
[SPEAKER_18]: I like it a lot.

1527
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:08,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have an orange mold.

1528
01:45:29,227 --> 01:45:30,507
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like fun.

1529
01:45:30,927 --> 01:45:31,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie's raising her hand.

1530
01:45:32,248 --> 01:45:34,128
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could like all overact on air and stuff.

1531
01:45:34,168 --> 01:45:34,548
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be fun.

1532
01:45:34,568 --> 01:45:35,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me talk about it.

1533
01:45:35,648 --> 01:45:37,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up, you bastard!

1534
01:45:38,989 --> 01:45:42,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go get my grandmother to come kill me now!

1535
01:45:45,330 --> 01:45:47,211
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to let you see your baby.

1536
01:45:48,211 --> 01:45:51,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, well I'm an alien twin from another planet.

1537
01:45:52,532 --> 01:45:53,912
[SPEAKER_03]: I came here to steal your socks.

1538
01:45:57,298 --> 01:46:00,839
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't have any multiple personalities, but my other ones do.

1539
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:03,160
[SPEAKER_22]: All five of them.

1540
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,060
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're twins.

1541
01:46:05,301 --> 01:46:10,642
[SPEAKER_11]: And worst of all, I never learned to read!

1542
01:46:10,662 --> 01:46:15,103
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like this, y'all were so cool!

1543
01:46:17,464 --> 01:46:17,884
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1544
01:46:17,904 --> 01:46:19,385
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not nerds here!

1545
01:46:20,825 --> 01:46:21,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

1546
01:46:21,885 --> 01:46:23,146
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that all you have to say about SimNews?

1547
01:46:24,485 --> 01:46:29,367
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing going on because people are lazy in school and distracted by the Super Bowl.

1548
01:46:29,447 --> 01:46:32,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I want some of your nuts, Brad.

1549
01:46:32,628 --> 01:46:33,709
[SPEAKER_02]: These are good, thank you.

1550
01:46:34,069 --> 01:46:35,789
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm a non-nut person.

1551
01:46:35,809 --> 01:46:36,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate nuts.

1552
01:46:36,950 --> 01:46:37,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Nuts suck.

1553
01:46:39,831 --> 01:46:40,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like nuts, man.

1554
01:46:41,632 --> 01:46:42,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Your cashews are in the living room here.

1555
01:46:49,675 --> 01:46:51,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to get to the cage match now, finally.

1556
01:46:52,756 --> 01:46:52,936
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1557
01:46:54,238 --> 01:46:57,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week, in the big, fat, hairy, scary cage match.

1558
01:46:57,300 --> 01:47:00,963
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, I don't even have a song picked for this weekend, so I've got to pick it right now.

1559
01:47:02,364 --> 01:47:03,305
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm going to do it.

1560
01:47:03,365 --> 01:47:04,005
[SPEAKER_18]: You already won.

1561
01:47:04,526 --> 01:47:04,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1562
01:47:05,847 --> 01:47:06,467
[SPEAKER_22]: You can pick your song.

1563
01:47:06,667 --> 01:47:07,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

1564
01:47:07,828 --> 01:47:14,173
[SPEAKER_22]: Remember, you can pick your nose, you can pick your friends, and you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friend's cage match song.

1565
01:47:14,533 --> 01:47:22,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week, on the Orange Bounce cage match, we had, in a very narrow victory over that Eat Em Up song by FX Twin...

1566
01:47:24,625 --> 01:47:30,189
[SPEAKER_02]: The winner of last week's Cage Match was Ayumi Hamasaki with M, the Above and Beyond remix.

1567
01:47:30,550 --> 01:47:37,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, by the way, the Cage Match, for those that don't know, we play three songs, most just pick each song, and you can vote.

1568
01:47:38,355 --> 01:47:44,000
[SPEAKER_02]: You can vote for last week's winner, you can vote for one of the two new songs, and the winning song goes into rotation.

1569
01:47:44,780 --> 01:47:50,948
[SPEAKER_02]: During Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani Music and More Program, which plays all the time on this station when we're not here.

1570
01:47:51,589 --> 01:47:53,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is last week's winner.

1571
01:47:53,291 --> 01:47:54,893
[SPEAKER_02]: We're only going to play a small clip of it.

1572
01:47:55,334 --> 01:47:57,697
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Ayumi Hamasaki with M, and you can vote for this.

1573
01:47:57,717 --> 01:47:59,700
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first thing you can vote for in this week's stage match.

1574
01:48:11,980 --> 01:48:12,901
Thank you for watching!

1575
01:49:05,745 --> 01:49:06,386
Thank you for watching!

1576
01:49:42,072 --> 01:49:45,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that was last week's winner, Yumi Hamasaki with M, so that's the first thing you can vote for.

1577
01:49:46,699 --> 01:49:51,906
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know what, I don't give a fuck if this is, uh, you know, a little, uh, private shit.

1578
01:49:52,186 --> 01:49:56,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, you fucking bitch twin, I didn't fucking diss slip, I was...

1579
01:49:56,852 --> 01:50:04,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Making a comment about how Slip causes people that not want to be talking on the forums because anyone that says anything stupid, he will go off on them.

1580
01:50:04,957 --> 01:50:06,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say anything bad about that.

1581
01:50:06,538 --> 01:50:07,199
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

1582
01:50:07,219 --> 01:50:09,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, people like doing that.

1583
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:12,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell, I like joking with stupid people and making fun of them.

1584
01:50:12,702 --> 01:50:13,402
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my thing.

1585
01:50:13,842 --> 01:50:15,803
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't make fun of Slip at all.

1586
01:50:15,923 --> 01:50:16,363
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1587
01:50:16,463 --> 01:50:21,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're doing a good job on that site, even though they don't like leechers and that kind of thing.

1588
01:50:21,484 --> 01:50:22,624
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, that's their thing.

1589
01:50:23,044 --> 01:50:25,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't ever say anything bad about Slip at all.

1590
01:50:25,405 --> 01:50:25,865
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know what?

1591
01:50:25,885 --> 01:50:28,465
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go fuck yourself and your fucking band.

1592
01:50:28,505 --> 01:50:29,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not talking to you, mister.

1593
01:50:29,825 --> 01:50:31,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're my best friend.

1594
01:50:31,106 --> 01:50:31,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

1595
01:50:31,926 --> 01:50:33,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Go fuck yourself there in Florida.

1596
01:50:34,026 --> 01:50:36,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Find some old hag and go fuck yourself, okay?

1597
01:50:37,347 --> 01:50:38,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy!

1598
01:50:38,307 --> 01:50:47,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize no one from Change the Channel listens to this show, but on the off chance that there's one of you listening, do yourselves a favor and ban Twin from your channel.

1599
01:50:48,510 --> 01:50:48,871
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1600
01:50:49,211 --> 01:50:54,992
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize we don't get along, we don't see eye to eye on everything, dudes that run that place, but you know what?

1601
01:50:55,613 --> 01:50:58,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, human to human, just do yourself a favor, ban him.

1602
01:50:58,653 --> 01:50:59,714
[SPEAKER_22]: First of all, you know what?

1603
01:51:00,274 --> 01:51:04,415
[SPEAKER_22]: And as for Twin, I put Twin in the same category that I put Slip.

1604
01:51:05,536 --> 01:51:06,776
[SPEAKER_22]: People I don't pay attention to.

1605
01:51:07,355 --> 01:51:08,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, fair enough.

1606
01:51:08,116 --> 01:51:09,257
[SPEAKER_02]: No more personal drama on this show.

1607
01:51:09,277 --> 01:51:10,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't we say fuck drama earlier?

1608
01:51:11,018 --> 01:51:11,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.

1609
01:51:11,298 --> 01:51:12,579
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I'm saying fuck it now.

1610
01:51:12,599 --> 01:51:13,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.

1611
01:51:13,820 --> 01:51:14,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, it's stupid.

1612
01:51:14,661 --> 01:51:15,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we do a cage match now?

1613
01:51:15,682 --> 01:51:15,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1614
01:51:15,882 --> 01:51:17,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's do the cage match.

1615
01:51:17,263 --> 01:51:18,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, speaking of cage match.

1616
01:51:19,885 --> 01:51:21,086
[SPEAKER_22]: My song owns all of you.

1617
01:51:21,166 --> 01:51:21,687
[SPEAKER_22]: Just play it.

1618
01:51:21,947 --> 01:51:22,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here it is.

1619
01:51:22,808 --> 01:51:24,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Vincent D'Amour with Eternity.

1620
01:51:24,169 --> 01:51:27,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Vincent D'Amour with Eternity is Jamie's pick for this week's cage match.

1621
01:51:27,752 --> 01:51:28,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

1622
01:51:29,253 --> 01:51:36,519
[SPEAKER_17]: Imagine there's a place in the light you see

1623
01:51:37,774 --> 01:51:39,557
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not only in your imagination.

1624
01:51:41,741 --> 01:51:45,688
[SPEAKER_06]: This is our reality.

1625
01:51:45,708 --> 01:51:46,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you feel it?

1626
01:51:46,249 --> 01:51:48,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me take you all the way.

1627
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:31,951
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

1628
01:52:59,468 --> 01:53:00,491
Thank you for watching!

1629
01:54:08,478 --> 01:54:09,060
and many more.

1630
01:55:00,510 --> 01:55:01,611
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, neat.

1631
01:55:01,791 --> 01:55:03,212
[SPEAKER_02]: That was in the cage match.

1632
01:55:03,973 --> 01:55:06,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Vincent Damore with Eternity, the full vocal remix.

1633
01:55:07,556 --> 01:55:12,980
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I have a controversial pick for this week's cage match.

1634
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:15,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry, yes, we have to go around the room and rate it.

1635
01:55:15,822 --> 01:55:16,242
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad.

1636
01:55:16,723 --> 01:55:17,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Ten for Eternity.

1637
01:55:17,764 --> 01:55:18,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Any particular reason why?

1638
01:55:18,684 --> 01:55:18,984
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1639
01:55:19,025 --> 01:55:19,205
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki.

1640
01:55:29,315 --> 01:55:38,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it, but it's like, it's just, I don't know, it's a bit more, it's an 8, I don't know, because I like all this stuff, but it's not even, like, scandalous.

1641
01:55:38,941 --> 01:55:40,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, that's something I never heard before.

1642
01:55:41,643 --> 01:55:45,005
[SPEAKER_34]: Uh, you didn't even hear the song, did you, that we just did?

1643
01:55:45,025 --> 01:55:45,405
[SPEAKER_34]: What song?

1644
01:55:45,725 --> 01:55:47,086
[SPEAKER_34]: Uh, Eternity by some more.

1645
01:55:47,566 --> 01:55:48,206
[SPEAKER_34]: I've heard it.

1646
01:55:48,607 --> 01:55:49,127
[SPEAKER_34]: What do you think?

1647
01:55:49,707 --> 01:55:55,471
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, I think it's a very classic, I agree with Loki, it's not like they jumped out and went, Holy crap!

1648
01:55:57,822 --> 01:55:59,143
[SPEAKER_23]: But it's really good, I like it.

1649
01:55:59,964 --> 01:56:01,025
[SPEAKER_23]: It's very classic.

1650
01:56:01,125 --> 01:56:05,109
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd rate it about, for him, I'd rate it about a 7 overall.

1651
01:56:09,494 --> 01:56:11,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Vincent D'Amour.

1652
01:56:11,876 --> 01:56:12,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Vincent D'Amour.

1653
01:56:12,857 --> 01:56:13,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I give it a 9.

1654
01:56:14,118 --> 01:56:14,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Eternity.

1655
01:56:14,559 --> 01:56:18,322
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the best Vincent D'Amour song, but it's pretty damn cool and I wouldn't be sad if it won.

1656
01:56:18,943 --> 01:56:21,546
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's what we all think of this week's Skate Matches.

1657
01:56:22,046 --> 01:56:48,895
[SPEAKER_02]: That pick, Vincent Damore with Eternity Now I have a kind of controversial one This is from a trance compilation and unfortunately I don't have the name of the artist that did this I have it somewhere, I just don't have it on me right now I can tell you this comes from the Velfire Cybertrance compilation This is track 4 and this is a remix of Thunderstruck Which was by ACDC originally Which is a group I don't particularly care for usually But I know Jamie really likes them and she does not like this mix at all

1658
01:56:49,835 --> 01:56:51,018
[SPEAKER_22]: I already know what I'm giving it.

1659
01:56:51,839 --> 01:56:52,460
[SPEAKER_02]: A one.

1660
01:56:52,861 --> 01:56:54,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, but judge for yourself.

1661
01:56:54,765 --> 01:56:57,190
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the third entry in the cage match this week.

1662
01:56:57,310 --> 01:56:58,713
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a remix of Thunderstruck.

1663
01:56:58,793 --> 01:56:59,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

1664
01:57:35,932 --> 01:57:50,443
[SPEAKER_16]: And I knew there was no turning back My mind raced and I thought, what could I do And I knew there was no help, no help from you Thunder

1665
01:58:25,607 --> 01:58:26,329
Thanks for watching!

1666
01:59:22,336 --> 01:59:23,698
Thank you for watching!

1667
02:00:24,389 --> 02:00:28,871
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that was from the Vellfire Cybertrans CD, Thunder.

1668
02:00:29,931 --> 02:00:30,492
[SPEAKER_02]: A little remix.

1669
02:00:30,592 --> 02:00:31,912
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm about to throw up.

1670
02:00:33,193 --> 02:00:35,674
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Jamie, dare I ask, what did you think of Thunder?

1671
02:00:36,134 --> 02:00:36,734
[SPEAKER_18]: Negative 12.

1672
02:00:37,615 --> 02:00:41,416
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, I love this song.

1673
02:00:42,537 --> 02:00:47,479
[SPEAKER_18]: And I like how they simulated the guitar rest of the keyboard.

1674
02:00:47,659 --> 02:00:49,319
[SPEAKER_20]: But I hate that it even exists.

1675
02:00:49,339 --> 02:00:52,081
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a song you should never transmix a CD to.

1676
02:00:55,783 --> 02:00:56,043
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1677
02:00:59,207 --> 02:01:01,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like the original, and I hated the remix.

1678
02:01:02,471 --> 02:01:03,893
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you don't mix that together.

1679
02:01:03,913 --> 02:01:06,416
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like mixing Ozzy Osbourne and Vince Samore.

1680
02:01:06,456 --> 02:01:08,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just... It doesn't make any sense.

1681
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:10,280
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1682
02:01:10,701 --> 02:01:11,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Awful one.

1683
02:01:11,061 --> 02:01:12,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Even better, uh...

1684
02:01:14,190 --> 02:01:17,752
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think of that Brad?

1685
02:01:18,253 --> 02:01:19,894
[SPEAKER_03]: I caught like the last five seconds.

1686
02:01:21,414 --> 02:01:23,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it a 10.

1687
02:01:23,556 --> 02:01:27,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't hear it, but now that I think I understand what it was, it was Thunderstock?

1688
02:01:27,258 --> 02:01:28,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but it was a cool transmit.

1689
02:01:28,879 --> 02:01:29,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that's cool.

1690
02:01:29,639 --> 02:01:30,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, that DJ should be blacklisted.

1691
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:34,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Never really allowed to do anything like that.

1692
02:01:40,906 --> 02:01:42,147
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, fine.

1693
02:01:42,167 --> 02:01:45,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm giving it a 10 simply to counterweight the rest of your votes.

1694
02:01:45,288 --> 02:01:48,650
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, but you're dealing with two 1s and a minus 12.

1695
02:01:49,970 --> 02:01:50,971
[SPEAKER_22]: Your 10 loses.

1696
02:01:51,611 --> 02:01:51,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I give it a 10.

1697
02:01:52,711 --> 02:01:51,991
10, 10, 10.

1698
02:01:53,812 --> 02:01:55,172
[SPEAKER_22]: It gets an overall of negative 1.

1699
02:01:58,062 --> 02:01:58,723
[SPEAKER_22]: I gave it a minus 12.

1700
02:02:00,023 --> 02:02:02,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm giving it a zero.

1701
02:02:03,045 --> 02:02:03,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, Loki.

1702
02:02:04,166 --> 02:02:11,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so send in your votes right now over private message in the channel and we'll tally up those votes and have it for you later.

1703
02:02:11,390 --> 02:02:15,653
[SPEAKER_02]: You can vote for either Ayumi Hamasaki, Tally Wacker.

1704
02:02:20,196 --> 02:02:22,297
[SPEAKER_02]: You can vote for Vincent Damore with Eternity.

1705
02:02:33,792 --> 02:02:35,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, gee, I guess there are no exciting parts, sorry.

1706
02:02:35,935 --> 02:02:41,421
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the trance remix of Thunderstruck that nobody likes here at Orange Lounge is at me.

1707
02:02:48,519 --> 02:02:52,361
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so you can vote for any one of those right now, right fucking now.

1708
02:02:52,821 --> 02:02:53,881
[SPEAKER_22]: This should be called Blender.

1709
02:02:54,381 --> 02:02:54,722
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1710
02:02:54,902 --> 02:02:55,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Blender.

1711
02:02:56,142 --> 02:02:57,763
[SPEAKER_02]: And the winner goes into rotation.

1712
02:02:59,844 --> 02:03:00,664
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Bomani Music War.

1713
02:03:00,744 --> 02:03:01,044
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

1714
02:03:01,104 --> 02:03:04,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give you all an STD live on air.

1715
02:03:05,786 --> 02:03:08,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm getting weird looks.

1716
02:03:09,427 --> 02:03:10,428
[SPEAKER_02]: AIDS for everyone!

1717
02:03:12,881 --> 02:03:17,942
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going in the next intro.

1718
02:03:18,463 --> 02:03:21,443
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm going to give all the little underprivileged children in the world AIDS.

1719
02:03:21,683 --> 02:03:22,284
[SPEAKER_23]: Myself.

1720
02:03:23,584 --> 02:03:24,464
[SPEAKER_02]: You're awful.

1721
02:03:25,564 --> 02:03:26,905
[SPEAKER_02]: You're an awful person.

1722
02:03:27,725 --> 02:03:31,786
[SPEAKER_22]: Brad will give them all AIDS and I'll give them a kick in the ass.

1723
02:03:32,506 --> 02:03:35,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, because I'm Jared Fogle from Subway.

1724
02:03:35,607 --> 02:03:38,688
[SPEAKER_22]: You'll give them AIDS and I'll give them a yeast infection.

1725
02:03:41,409 --> 02:03:42,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

1726
02:03:43,334 --> 02:03:49,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you keep it in a jar or something so you just open it up, can of yeast infection and dump it on somebody?

1727
02:03:49,195 --> 02:03:52,876
[SPEAKER_22]: The little yeast infection goodies.

1728
02:03:53,176 --> 02:03:54,697
[SPEAKER_22]: What disease would you like to transmit?

1729
02:03:56,737 --> 02:03:59,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I could transmit the stupid, I guess.

1730
02:04:02,358 --> 02:04:04,759
[SPEAKER_22]: I have the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie-woogie flu.

1731
02:04:07,923 --> 02:04:09,224
[SPEAKER_02]: What disease do you want to transmit, Rob?

1732
02:04:09,244 --> 02:04:10,685
[SPEAKER_02]: What disease do I want to transmit?

1733
02:04:11,165 --> 02:04:11,505
[SPEAKER_02]: 2DX.

1734
02:04:13,386 --> 02:04:16,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to transmit mental retardation.

1735
02:04:16,448 --> 02:04:17,949
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to transmit the gay gene.

1736
02:04:25,854 --> 02:04:27,876
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1737
02:04:43,590 --> 02:04:44,231
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't want women!

1738
02:05:07,588 --> 02:05:08,329
[SPEAKER_22]: and then I hugged Armine.

1739
02:05:10,070 --> 02:05:10,230
[SPEAKER_22]: Ow!

1740
02:05:10,770 --> 02:05:12,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Lesbian sex, A+.

1741
02:05:12,792 --> 02:05:14,573
[SPEAKER_02]: We need some hot lesbian action on Orange Lodge.

1742
02:05:14,593 --> 02:05:16,515
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to call up Amanda and Yana and get them back on air.

1743
02:05:16,555 --> 02:05:16,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1744
02:05:18,776 --> 02:05:21,598
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's sad though is that Yana moved to the Bay Area to be with Amanda.

1745
02:05:21,838 --> 02:05:24,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I don't want to see my ex-girlfriend having lesbians.

1746
02:05:28,483 --> 02:05:29,964
[SPEAKER_02]: What if your current girlfriend had lesbian sex?

1747
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:30,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that be okay?

1748
02:05:32,287 --> 02:05:33,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, hey.

1749
02:05:33,427 --> 02:05:34,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, hey.

1750
02:05:34,728 --> 02:05:34,988
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1751
02:05:35,228 --> 02:05:36,628
[SPEAKER_22]: It would be better if you were involved.

1752
02:05:36,908 --> 02:05:37,228
[SPEAKER_22]: Ow!

1753
02:05:37,268 --> 02:05:40,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it wouldn't be officially lesbian.

1754
02:05:41,209 --> 02:05:55,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's, see, any straight guy, any straight guy that wants to see lesbian sex has this, you know, thought in the back of his head that it's not really lesbian sex because they'll be all, oh, gosh, we're having lesbian sex and it's so great, but we really need a dick right now.

1755
02:05:55,772 --> 02:05:56,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Join in.

1756
02:05:56,492 --> 02:05:57,212
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know.

1757
02:05:57,992 --> 02:06:00,453
[SPEAKER_03]: What they don't know is that they don't want the dick.

1758
02:06:00,473 --> 02:06:02,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're lesbian sex.

1759
02:06:02,713 --> 02:06:04,814
[SPEAKER_03]: They hate dick.

1760
02:06:04,834 --> 02:06:05,374
[SPEAKER_03]: They're lesbians.

1761
02:06:05,394 --> 02:06:06,715
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to get with you guys.

1762
02:06:07,195 --> 02:06:07,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

1763
02:06:08,735 --> 02:06:13,757
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, what I don't get is why guys are so hot about seeing, you know, two chicks getting it on.

1764
02:06:14,237 --> 02:06:19,279
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you say earlier in the show about wanting to have that room at Golfland where the hot guys get it on with each other?

1765
02:06:20,059 --> 02:06:27,602
[SPEAKER_22]: But yet, you know, a certain significant other of mine has a problem with me wanting to see two guys get it on.

1766
02:06:28,702 --> 02:06:29,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

1767
02:06:29,162 --> 02:06:30,823
[SPEAKER_22]: He's jealous of my Dojinshi collection.

1768
02:06:32,210 --> 02:06:44,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand what the problem would be.

1769
02:06:44,060 --> 02:06:48,303
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's like, I mean, hell, if I saw two lesbians, I wouldn't expect to be jumping in.

1770
02:06:48,383 --> 02:06:49,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, hello, lesbian.

1771
02:06:50,525 --> 02:06:52,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Meaning, they don't have sex with men.

1772
02:06:53,331 --> 02:06:53,951
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just watching.

1773
02:06:53,971 --> 02:06:57,332
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a porno without the TV and not the video, without the videotape.

1774
02:06:57,412 --> 02:07:00,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and welcome to the real life, you know, thing here.

1775
02:07:00,132 --> 02:07:01,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Most lesbians are pretty ugly.

1776
02:07:01,812 --> 02:07:14,935
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, no, for guys, you know, I think, for guys, I think it's okay because I think it's, you know, an easier time for, you know, guys to get it on so women should actually have the advantage in seeing the yaoi thing.

1777
02:07:15,475 --> 02:07:21,476
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, it's, I think, harder for girls to be stimulating without having the tools.

1778
02:07:23,363 --> 02:07:23,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm confused, maybe.

1779
02:07:23,924 --> 02:07:24,504
[SPEAKER_22]: It's more effort.

1780
02:07:25,625 --> 02:07:26,426
[SPEAKER_03]: For girls, too?

1781
02:07:26,466 --> 02:07:26,946
[SPEAKER_22]: I think so.

1782
02:07:28,888 --> 02:07:29,729
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have skill.

1783
02:07:30,249 --> 02:07:35,313
[SPEAKER_03]: See, girls, they have access to the equipment 24-7, so they know exactly what to do.

1784
02:07:40,238 --> 02:07:43,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about how I jack my hot spicy boner every day, guys!

1785
02:07:44,021 --> 02:07:47,544
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, see, guys can get themselves off at any given time, okay?

1786
02:07:48,185 --> 02:07:49,125
[SPEAKER_03]: And girls can, too!

1787
02:07:49,226 --> 02:07:50,106
[SPEAKER_03]: It just takes a little longer.

1788
02:07:50,126 --> 02:07:50,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily!

1789
02:07:51,565 --> 02:07:52,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Jamie.

1790
02:07:52,366 --> 02:07:53,687
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not elaborating on that, though.

1791
02:07:55,929 --> 02:07:56,950
[SPEAKER_22]: Chatroom, what do you think?

1792
02:07:57,350 --> 02:07:58,051
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, talk to us.

1793
02:07:58,071 --> 02:07:59,472
[SPEAKER_22]: Who has an easier time getting off?

1794
02:07:59,672 --> 02:08:02,815
[SPEAKER_23]: How many girls are in the chatroom now that can tell us how quickly to get off?

1795
02:08:02,855 --> 02:08:05,517
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it would take absolutely nothing for a guy to get off.

1796
02:08:05,777 --> 02:08:07,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it could take me about five or ten seconds.

1797
02:08:07,079 --> 02:08:08,540
[SPEAKER_22]: Guys pop boners at the most stupid things.

1798
02:08:09,741 --> 02:08:12,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, when I first saw Metroid Prime... Oh...

1799
02:08:15,980 --> 02:08:17,141
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean you don't get a clit on?

1800
02:08:18,481 --> 02:08:19,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the porno last night?

1801
02:08:19,742 --> 02:08:20,882
[SPEAKER_02]: They were talking about clit ons.

1802
02:08:21,442 --> 02:08:22,783
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't work that way.

1803
02:08:23,763 --> 02:08:25,124
[SPEAKER_22]: It does not work that way.

1804
02:08:26,404 --> 02:08:28,165
[SPEAKER_22]: Because we're more sophisticated beings.

1805
02:08:28,565 --> 02:08:29,706
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, oh, wait a minute.

1806
02:08:30,786 --> 02:08:31,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

1807
02:08:31,486 --> 02:08:33,547
[SPEAKER_22]: It takes more to simulate a woman.

1808
02:08:35,588 --> 02:08:37,389
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes diesel-powered equipment.

1809
02:08:40,459 --> 02:09:01,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to seriously give you that, I gotta give you a copy of that Sexcore TV, the movie, that's hilarious, she has, she has, okay, you know how they have those, um, uh, those, like, hedge clippers, you know, with the blade that goes up and down, okay, well, imagine that, but you strap a dildo to it, and she's just like, going, going at it with that.

[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1811
02:09:03,190 --> 02:09:05,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to take a quick break and try to get the show out of the toilet.

1812
02:09:06,474 --> 02:09:09,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when we come back... I found a funny site.

1813
02:09:09,698 --> 02:09:10,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh dear.

[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, what about the cage match?

1819

02:20:07,494 --> 02:20:08,474
[SPEAKER_02]: This is episode number 30.

1850
02:20:08,554 --> 02:20:10,335
[SPEAKER_02]: We're over the hill now.

[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when I hit 30, I'm going to be crying because I think I'm over the hill.

1855
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:16,920
[SPEAKER_22]: We're at our sexual peak.

[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we're at our sexual peak.

1857

1858
02:20:20,222 --> 02:20:20,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

1859
02:20:21,103 --> 02:20:23,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lawn's radio is at its female sexual peak.

1860
02:20:26,466 --> 02:20:28,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've been there and back.

1861
02:20:28,067 --> 02:20:30,589
[SPEAKER_22]: You mean you've done a 30-year-old?

1862
02:20:30,869 --> 02:20:31,770
[SPEAKER_02]: You've done a 30-year-old?

1863
02:20:33,631 --> 02:20:34,111
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1864
02:20:34,592 --> 02:20:34,912
[SPEAKER_22]: Would you?

1865
02:20:37,433 --> 02:20:38,694
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking about a woman here, right?

1866
02:20:38,794 --> 02:20:39,054
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1867
02:20:40,936 --> 02:20:41,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1868
02:20:41,937 --> 02:20:42,797
[SPEAKER_03]: If she was hot enough.

1869
02:20:43,958 --> 02:20:44,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I did one that was 28.

1870
02:20:44,518 --> 02:20:45,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that count?

1871
02:20:46,039 --> 02:20:46,259
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1872
02:20:46,620 --> 02:20:47,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1873
02:20:48,321 --> 02:20:48,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I was 17.

1874
02:20:48,701 --> 02:20:49,381
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

1875
02:20:49,461 --> 02:20:53,184
[SPEAKER_22]: What if she may not necessarily be hot, but was incredibly skilled?

1876
02:20:55,751 --> 02:20:57,312
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1877
02:21:20,928 --> 02:21:24,409
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but see, now the whole thing with the swallowing, I don't even get that.

1878
02:21:24,449 --> 02:21:25,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, who cares?

1879
02:21:25,929 --> 02:21:26,470
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucks.

1880
02:21:27,070 --> 02:21:29,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does, okay, she gets like the best out of both worlds.

1881
02:21:29,310 --> 02:21:31,171
[SPEAKER_03]: She gets to eat and she gets to have sex.

1882
02:21:31,611 --> 02:21:32,911
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck is up with that?

1883
02:21:32,931 --> 02:21:40,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if I could have a, if I could have a pizza and be getting hit at the same time, man, I, I'd be the happiest guy in the world, man.

1884
02:21:40,453 --> 02:21:42,134
[SPEAKER_03]: You're eating pizza, hey, good job.

1885
02:21:43,945 --> 02:21:44,386
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what?

1886
02:21:44,486 --> 02:21:46,468
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't see why people are so fascinated with that.

1887
02:21:46,488 --> 02:21:47,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even understand that.

1888
02:21:47,409 --> 02:21:47,890
[SPEAKER_03]: It's stupid.

1889
02:21:47,930 --> 02:21:50,492
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like... I want to know what the advantage of putting something... Do you want a medal?

1890
02:21:50,512 --> 02:21:51,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want a pat on the back?

1891
02:21:51,594 --> 02:21:54,817
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to know what the advantage of putting something in your mouth that a guy pisses with.

1892
02:21:55,238 --> 02:21:55,538
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay?

1893
02:21:58,421 --> 02:22:02,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, uh... It goes both ways, you know?

1894
02:22:06,599 --> 02:22:06,879
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1895
02:22:07,899 --> 02:22:12,601
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do a segment here that we did a couple weeks ago that everybody loved.

1896
02:22:12,641 --> 02:22:13,421
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're doing it again.

1897
02:22:14,241 --> 02:22:15,562
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Ask Orange Lounge.

1898
02:22:15,702 --> 02:22:16,182
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1899
02:22:17,442 --> 02:22:21,363
[SPEAKER_02]: You can send us your questions over private message to me in the chat room right now.

1900
02:22:22,644 --> 02:22:25,364
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll answer them live here on air.

1901
02:22:25,384 --> 02:22:27,165
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to start with a question from EOSFVB.

1902
02:22:28,641 --> 02:22:32,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Who says, I am trying to compile a list of places to have sex.

1903
02:22:33,462 --> 02:22:35,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Cast, please help me.

1904
02:22:35,803 --> 02:22:38,783
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to clarify, he is in Vegas, and he says yes.

1905
02:22:39,343 --> 02:22:43,884
[SPEAKER_02]: And he already has listed at the Tropicana because they have mirrors on the ceiling in every room.

1906
02:22:44,104 --> 02:22:45,245
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Tropicana is taken care of.

1907
02:22:45,685 --> 02:22:47,805
[SPEAKER_02]: So, places the OSFBB needs to have sex.

1908
02:22:50,086 --> 02:22:50,546
[SPEAKER_02]: In Vegas.

1909
02:22:50,886 --> 02:22:51,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been to Vegas.

1910
02:22:52,006 --> 02:22:52,946
[SPEAKER_02]: You've never been to Vegas.

1911
02:22:53,186 --> 02:22:53,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been to Vegas.

1912
02:22:53,826 --> 02:22:56,167
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have sex at Gypsy.

1913
02:22:58,916 --> 02:23:00,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully he catches the reference.

1914
02:23:01,097 --> 02:23:05,498
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that place that was in Showgirls?

1915
02:23:05,798 --> 02:23:06,358
[SPEAKER_02]: The Cheetah.

1916
02:23:06,599 --> 02:23:08,039
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, you need to get a lap dance at the Cheetah.

1917
02:23:08,119 --> 02:23:09,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you need to get a lap dance at the Cheetah.

1918
02:23:11,240 --> 02:23:14,181
[SPEAKER_22]: And then rent a nice room at the Monte Carlo.

1919
02:23:14,921 --> 02:23:15,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1920
02:23:16,802 --> 02:23:17,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Monte Carlo's good.

1921
02:23:18,062 --> 02:23:20,483
[SPEAKER_22]: He does for classy.

1922
02:23:20,663 --> 02:23:22,183
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many whorehouses.

1923
02:23:22,403 --> 02:23:22,663
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1924
02:23:22,683 --> 02:23:25,404
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have sex in the desert next to a cactus.

1925
02:23:25,564 --> 02:23:26,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be fun.

1926
02:23:26,625 --> 02:23:27,265
[SPEAKER_22]: And then eat it.

1927
02:23:30,095 --> 02:23:32,075
[SPEAKER_22]: Eat some peyote and then have sex.

1928
02:23:32,215 --> 02:23:32,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.

1929
02:23:33,196 --> 02:23:35,056
[SPEAKER_02]: And get some free sex flyers, too.

1930
02:23:35,076 --> 02:23:35,596
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be cool.

1931
02:23:35,876 --> 02:23:40,357
[SPEAKER_22]: You can get those cards that have the transgendered women on there.

1932
02:23:41,417 --> 02:23:44,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you need to have sex with somebody transgendered.

1933
02:23:44,158 --> 02:23:44,698
[SPEAKER_02]: That would work.

1934
02:23:45,058 --> 02:23:48,859
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how they have those lunch cards where they punch them and stuff?

1935
02:23:48,879 --> 02:23:51,459
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to get one of those for a prostitute because that would be hilarious.

1936
02:23:51,639 --> 02:23:52,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.

1937
02:23:54,220 --> 02:23:55,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Where else in Vegas does he need to have sex?

1938
02:23:55,700 --> 02:23:56,140
[SPEAKER_02]: How about...

1939
02:23:58,172 --> 02:24:00,674
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that spinning guitar at the Hard Rock Hotel.

1940
02:24:02,376 --> 02:24:04,397
[SPEAKER_22]: The basement at the Excalibur.

1941
02:24:04,738 --> 02:24:06,279
[SPEAKER_02]: The basement of the Excalibur.

1942
02:24:06,999 --> 02:24:08,100
[SPEAKER_22]: On the Technomotion machine.

1943
02:24:08,120 --> 02:24:09,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, okay, on the Technomotion machine.

1944
02:24:11,003 --> 02:24:11,483
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1945
02:24:11,583 --> 02:24:18,329
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have sex at Caesar's Palace in the forums, like on the fountain with the animatronic Neptune guy.

1946
02:24:18,849 --> 02:24:19,970
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you need to have sex.

1947
02:24:20,270 --> 02:24:21,872
[SPEAKER_03]: On top of the pirate ship that burns.

1948
02:24:22,012 --> 02:24:22,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes!

1949
02:24:23,053 --> 02:24:24,594
[SPEAKER_02]: On a pirate ship in Treasure Island.

1950
02:24:24,934 --> 02:24:25,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, good one.

1951
02:24:27,020 --> 02:24:28,980
[SPEAKER_22]: Go on the one that sinks while it's sinking.

1952
02:24:29,421 --> 02:24:32,481
[SPEAKER_02]: So have sex on the sinking boat at Treasure Island.

1953
02:24:32,601 --> 02:24:33,261
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our answer.

1954
02:24:33,642 --> 02:24:34,682
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you need to have sex.

1955
02:24:35,082 --> 02:24:35,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1956
02:24:36,282 --> 02:24:36,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope that helped.

1957
02:24:38,263 --> 02:24:52,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Lab asks, Puppy wants to know, based on everyone that we've met on this show, if everyone there in Channel Orange Lounge and the studio were to get into a big fight,

1958
02:24:53,231 --> 02:24:53,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever guessed?

1959
02:25:13,823 --> 02:25:16,986
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd probably say that Melody would win.

1960
02:25:17,867 --> 02:25:18,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Which Melody?

1961
02:25:18,407 --> 02:25:19,128
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had two Melodies.

1962
02:25:19,228 --> 02:25:21,710
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Angel Melody and then we had Mel B's girlfriend Melody.

1963
02:25:22,091 --> 02:25:24,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that would be Shark Skrull Melody.

1964
02:25:24,253 --> 02:25:25,314
[SPEAKER_22]: Because she's badass.

1965
02:25:25,874 --> 02:25:26,515
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I think she's badass.

1966
02:25:26,575 --> 02:25:27,296
[SPEAKER_20]: Of us, I would win.

1967
02:25:32,114 --> 02:25:34,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, if the three of us got in a fight, you mean you would win?

1968
02:25:34,076 --> 02:25:35,898
[SPEAKER_22]: All I have to do is kick both of you in the balls.

1969
02:25:36,759 --> 02:25:37,780
[SPEAKER_02]: We could kick you in the boob.

1970
02:25:38,461 --> 02:25:39,221
[SPEAKER_22]: You've got two of them.

1971
02:25:39,722 --> 02:25:40,483
[SPEAKER_03]: One foot each.

1972
02:25:40,683 --> 02:25:41,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you know what?

1973
02:25:41,724 --> 02:25:43,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys see that coming here right away.

1974
02:25:43,265 --> 02:25:45,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's just like a big target.

1975
02:25:45,808 --> 02:25:46,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Hit me here.

1976
02:25:46,449 --> 02:25:48,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're expecting that, okay?

1977
02:25:49,271 --> 02:25:51,433
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll smack you both in my purse if I have the time.

1978
02:26:08,727 --> 02:26:10,548
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyone who's ever been in the chatroom, Clint.

1979
02:26:12,409 --> 02:26:12,910
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

1980
02:26:13,190 --> 02:26:15,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that would be the lose.

1981
02:26:15,251 --> 02:26:16,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Shine lose right there.

1982
02:26:17,012 --> 02:26:19,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the folks in there right now, you know what?

1983
02:26:19,833 --> 02:26:21,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Chubbs would kick a lot of ass.

1984
02:26:22,215 --> 02:26:24,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Chubbs would lay the smack down.

1985
02:26:24,356 --> 02:26:30,960
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would come down all to Chubbs and Mel B. Mel's not in the chat right now, but he's been on the show before.

1986
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:32,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's where the fight would come down.

1987
02:26:35,129 --> 02:26:36,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Wendell would kick some ass, too.

1988
02:26:37,311 --> 02:26:38,933
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, Wendell would kick all kinds of ass.

1989
02:26:39,634 --> 02:26:45,100
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true, but Wendell's never been... Oh, Wendell's been in the segments, on the interview segments, so I guess that counts.

1990
02:26:47,442 --> 02:26:51,867
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, but I think that overall, Jahi would own everybody, just the personality alone.

1991
02:26:52,347 --> 02:26:54,430
[SPEAKER_02]: True, Jahi would yell everybody to death.

1992
02:26:57,513 --> 02:26:58,874
[SPEAKER_22]: He's my great defender anyway.

1993
02:27:01,536 --> 02:27:02,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so that's your answer.

1994
02:27:02,477 --> 02:27:03,218
[SPEAKER_02]: That's who'd win a fight.

1995
02:27:04,238 --> 02:27:07,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving along here with Ask Orange Lounge.

1996
02:27:08,001 --> 02:27:08,922
[SPEAKER_02]: We're running out of questions.

1997
02:27:08,962 --> 02:27:09,542
[SPEAKER_02]: We need more.

1998
02:27:09,842 --> 02:27:11,023
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, question us.

1999
02:27:11,143 --> 02:27:18,149
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also send us questions over email to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com and we'll answer those live on air as well.

2000
02:27:19,486 --> 02:27:21,948
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember, if you ask a personal question, we don't necessarily have to answer it.

2001
02:27:21,968 --> 02:27:25,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you ask a really, really personal question, we may not answer.

2002
02:27:25,369 --> 02:27:27,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we'll make something up.

2003
02:27:29,592 --> 02:27:29,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2004
02:27:31,013 --> 02:27:33,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, there's an interesting question from Shadow.

2005
02:27:34,295 --> 02:27:35,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of personal questions.

2006
02:27:37,016 --> 02:27:41,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, what is the best position for giving the chicks the best sexual satisfaction?

2007
02:27:45,321 --> 02:27:46,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie continues doing her nails.

2008
02:27:46,822 --> 02:27:47,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2009
02:27:48,757 --> 02:27:51,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to answer it, or are you going to tell them to... The mechanical one.

2010
02:27:56,122 --> 02:27:58,303
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically guys are incapable, so give it up.

2011
02:27:59,444 --> 02:27:59,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2012
02:28:01,285 --> 02:28:01,765
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2013
02:28:01,906 --> 02:28:05,448
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think a guy can pleasure a woman as well as she can figure out how to pleasure herself.

2014
02:28:06,088 --> 02:28:07,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, zing!

2015
02:28:08,990 --> 02:28:10,531
[SPEAKER_03]: You would think that, yeah, of course.

2016
02:28:11,392 --> 02:28:11,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently...

2017
02:28:18,647 --> 02:28:24,230
[SPEAKER_22]: Except, you know, remember, masturbation and porn are for people who don't get laid.

2018
02:28:24,250 --> 02:28:25,390
[SPEAKER_22]: Porn is just comedy.

2019
02:28:27,251 --> 02:28:29,972
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with you there about porn being comedy.

2020
02:28:29,992 --> 02:28:30,833
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just fun.

2021
02:28:31,433 --> 02:28:35,435
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, why try to inject a plot into something that really means none?

2022
02:28:35,475 --> 02:28:37,176
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I think.

2023
02:28:37,236 --> 02:28:38,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's funny.

2024
02:28:41,880 --> 02:28:42,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on.

2025
02:28:43,141 --> 02:28:45,422
[SPEAKER_02]: We have another question from EOSFBB.

2026
02:28:46,723 --> 02:28:52,046
[SPEAKER_02]: He has on his list, his list of places he wants to have sex, he says, sex in a confessional, good kinkiness or morally wrong?

2027
02:28:52,887 --> 02:28:53,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

2028
02:28:54,167 --> 02:28:56,769
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, they had that contest going on the radio a while back.

2029
02:28:56,849 --> 02:28:59,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, Opie and Anthony, remember those kids?

2030
02:28:59,171 --> 02:29:04,074
[SPEAKER_02]: They got kicked off the air for that shit, so we can't really answer that because we don't want to get... Oh, wait, we're on the internet.

2031
02:29:04,114 --> 02:29:05,075
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do whatever the fuck we want.

2032
02:29:06,336 --> 02:29:09,418
[SPEAKER_22]: Go fuck in the changing room that the priests use.

2033
02:29:10,399 --> 02:29:12,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, that's better than the confessional.

2034
02:29:12,281 --> 02:29:14,002
[SPEAKER_22]: You might walk in on them with a little boy or something.

2035
02:29:14,062 --> 02:29:14,502
[SPEAKER_22]: Use the pew.

2036
02:29:14,522 --> 02:29:15,123
[SPEAKER_22]: Sex and a pew?

2037
02:29:21,106 --> 02:29:23,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be afraid to have sex in a church.

2038
02:29:23,168 --> 02:29:26,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the problem with sex in a church is that I wouldn't be able to get it up.

2039
02:29:26,749 --> 02:29:28,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be too afraid of, like, lightning hitting me.

2040
02:29:30,992 --> 02:29:31,252
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2041
02:29:32,573 --> 02:29:34,373
[SPEAKER_02]: We both just hear a blink, blink, blink.

2042
02:29:35,114 --> 02:29:36,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, see, that's the thing.

2043
02:29:36,234 --> 02:29:37,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you can have sex in a church.

2044
02:29:37,775 --> 02:29:38,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you'd be able to get it up.

2045
02:29:38,876 --> 02:29:40,937
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can, hey, you're weird.

2046
02:29:41,357 --> 02:29:41,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2047
02:29:44,199 --> 02:29:46,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, uh, Stresa would like to point out he hasn't gotten any...

2048
02:29:49,249 --> 02:29:50,589
[SPEAKER_02]: But have you gotten compliments?

2049
02:29:50,710 --> 02:29:52,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the thing.

2050
02:29:53,290 --> 02:29:58,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Women a lot of times, you know, they're not going to see anything because they're afraid that they'll hurt your feelings or something.

2051
02:29:58,432 --> 02:30:01,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again, there's those women that are like, you fucking suck.

2052
02:30:01,533 --> 02:30:03,414
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah.

2053
02:30:04,534 --> 02:30:06,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, just do this, okay?

2054
02:30:06,594 --> 02:30:08,995
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like she's liking it.

2055
02:30:09,015 --> 02:30:09,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep doing what you're doing.

2056
02:30:10,395 --> 02:30:17,616
[SPEAKER_03]: If she doesn't like it, or it doesn't look like she's enjoying herself, I mean, and you should be able to tell, I mean, none of this, like, she's faking shit.

2057
02:30:17,656 --> 02:30:18,776
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you can tell, okay?

2058
02:30:19,477 --> 02:30:20,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell if she's liking it.

2059
02:30:20,477 --> 02:30:23,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, uh, if something's not working, then try something else.

2060
02:30:24,097 --> 02:30:29,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Just experiment, and you'll eventually find something that, you know, works really good, and just keep doing that.

2061
02:30:29,838 --> 02:30:31,779
[SPEAKER_03]: You can only get better.

2062
02:30:31,799 --> 02:30:33,319
[SPEAKER_22]: This segment has been Loki's Exception.

2063
02:30:34,420 --> 02:30:36,322
[SPEAKER_22]: Sponsored by Folgers Coffee.

2064
02:30:36,722 --> 02:30:39,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, stress is sharing that he has gotten a few compliments.

2065
02:30:40,066 --> 02:30:40,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Aww.

2066
02:30:40,326 --> 02:30:40,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Aww, cute.

2067
02:30:40,847 --> 02:30:41,607
[SPEAKER_02]: More questions!

2068
02:30:41,848 --> 02:30:43,169
[SPEAKER_02]: More quite, we were out of questions.

2069
02:30:43,570 --> 02:30:44,931
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys need to send us more questions.

2070
02:30:45,191 --> 02:30:45,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Question us more.

2071
02:30:46,433 --> 02:30:47,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Send us more questions over private message.

2072
02:30:47,754 --> 02:30:51,758
[SPEAKER_02]: You can ask us about something Bomani, that would be okay too, seeing as this is supposed to be a Bomani show.

2073
02:30:52,219 --> 02:30:52,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Heh, heh.

2074
02:30:53,635 --> 02:30:56,337
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and was Under Station a rocky show?

2075
02:30:56,357 --> 02:30:57,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, true, very true.

2076
02:30:58,118 --> 02:31:00,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, listen to understationlive.org, they're back on the air now.

2077
02:31:00,640 --> 02:31:03,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do Bomani stuff, we've got only like one more thing to talk about.

2078
02:31:03,782 --> 02:31:05,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, then I have to stop the music.

2079
02:31:07,424 --> 02:31:13,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the only other Bomani thing that actually happened this week, the only thing that happened, actually two things.

2080
02:31:13,708 --> 02:31:16,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Internet ranking for DV Extreme came up, yay.

2081
02:31:17,012 --> 02:31:25,956
[SPEAKER_03]: and they found out if you play Paranoia Rebirth and get double A, play Paranoia Evolution and get double A, then you get to play Paranoia Survivor Max in DDR Extreme.

2082
02:31:26,557 --> 02:31:27,357
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about it.

2083
02:31:27,837 --> 02:31:29,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, back to the ask questions thing.

2084
02:31:29,538 --> 02:31:30,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, ask questions.

2085
02:31:30,299 --> 02:31:30,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

2086
02:31:30,579 --> 02:31:31,219
[SPEAKER_02]: We got another question.

2087
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:34,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray for people saving this segment.

2088
02:31:35,941 --> 02:31:38,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Lab wants to... Oh, goddammit.

2089
02:31:39,443 --> 02:31:42,384
[SPEAKER_02]: When is someone going to kidnap me and take me to Scandia for 2DX?

2090
02:31:42,945 --> 02:31:44,045
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, soon?

2091
02:31:45,126 --> 02:31:45,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Never.

2092
02:31:46,650 --> 02:31:50,173
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2093
02:32:09,112 --> 02:32:12,675
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2094
02:32:37,712 --> 02:32:38,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, sorry.

2095
02:32:38,852 --> 02:32:39,573
[SPEAKER_02]: What, you cut your finger?

2096
02:32:39,593 --> 02:32:41,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you okay?

2097
02:32:42,053 --> 02:32:42,453
[SPEAKER_02]: You okay?

2098
02:32:43,473 --> 02:32:44,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, JB's okay.

2099
02:32:45,114 --> 02:32:45,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yes.

2100
02:32:47,014 --> 02:32:54,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be going, and then I'm going to be coming back on Saturday, so I can swing by Davis and get you on Saturday if you want, and we'll go to Scandia on Sunday.

2101
02:32:54,236 --> 02:32:54,676
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that sound?

2102
02:32:54,696 --> 02:32:56,817
[SPEAKER_22]: I just thought of a guest who can kick everybody's ass.

2103
02:32:56,837 --> 02:32:57,197
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

2104
02:32:57,377 --> 02:32:57,757
[SPEAKER_22]: Shermie.

2105
02:32:58,923 --> 02:33:00,524
[SPEAKER_22]: Shermie has been a guest on the show.

2106
02:33:00,584 --> 02:33:03,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think Shermie would claw Chubbs to death, even?

2107
02:33:04,325 --> 02:33:06,306
[SPEAKER_22]: She would out-cute.

2108
02:33:07,287 --> 02:33:07,447
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh!

2109
02:33:07,567 --> 02:33:08,727
[SPEAKER_22]: And then Shermie would kick their ass.

2110
02:33:09,668 --> 02:33:11,489
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, everyone's like, oh, cute.

2111
02:33:11,569 --> 02:33:11,929
[SPEAKER_34]: All right.

2112
02:33:12,749 --> 02:33:14,650
[SPEAKER_22]: Shermie's the cutest guest we've ever had on the show.

2113
02:33:14,670 --> 02:33:15,170
[SPEAKER_22]: And you weren't here.

2114
02:33:15,870 --> 02:33:16,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I wasn't here.

2115
02:33:16,491 --> 02:33:16,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

2116
02:33:16,951 --> 02:33:20,613
[SPEAKER_22]: Shermie was in the show at my house, and Shermie was like, I'm in the show.

2117
02:33:20,913 --> 02:33:23,094
[SPEAKER_22]: And she purred on the microphone.

2118
02:33:23,134 --> 02:33:24,074
[SPEAKER_22]: She farted on the microphone?

2119
02:33:24,094 --> 02:33:24,614
[SPEAKER_22]: She purred!

2120
02:33:26,375 --> 02:33:26,855
[SPEAKER_22]: My pussy.

2121
02:33:27,976 --> 02:33:28,216
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2122
02:33:29,110 --> 02:33:30,572
[SPEAKER_22]: People have met my Shermie.

2123
02:33:30,592 --> 02:33:32,874
[SPEAKER_22]: My baby.

2124
02:33:32,995 --> 02:33:36,098
[SPEAKER_09]: My cat is cute, right?

2125
02:33:36,118 --> 02:33:37,259
[SPEAKER_09]: My cat's cute.

2126
02:33:38,060 --> 02:33:38,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2127
02:33:39,522 --> 02:33:40,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving along.

2128
02:33:40,063 --> 02:33:41,204
[SPEAKER_02]: I stress I agree.

2129
02:33:41,224 --> 02:33:42,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Shermie is the cutest pussy he's ever seen.

2130
02:33:43,086 --> 02:33:44,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you.

2131
02:33:44,087 --> 02:33:44,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2132
02:33:44,588 --> 02:33:45,209
[SPEAKER_02]: More questions!

2133
02:33:48,023 --> 02:33:48,564
[SPEAKER_02]: 23rd Magus.

2134
02:33:48,764 --> 02:33:50,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he's got a Bamani-related question.

2135
02:33:50,505 --> 02:33:50,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.

2136
02:33:51,426 --> 02:33:53,128
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the easiest katas?

2137
02:33:53,348 --> 02:33:56,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I have four so far, and I want to get more under my belt.

2138
02:33:56,631 --> 02:33:57,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question.

2139
02:33:57,031 --> 02:33:57,431
[SPEAKER_22]: Kakumei.

2140
02:33:57,792 --> 02:33:58,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Kakumei?

2141
02:33:58,352 --> 02:33:58,692
[SPEAKER_22]: I feel.

2142
02:33:59,233 --> 02:34:00,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel.

2143
02:34:00,754 --> 02:34:01,515
[SPEAKER_22]: Hypnotic Crisis.

2144
02:34:01,635 --> 02:34:02,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Hypnotic Crisis.

2145
02:34:02,435 --> 02:34:03,036
[SPEAKER_02]: My Summer Love.

2146
02:34:03,957 --> 02:34:04,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.

2147
02:34:04,317 --> 02:34:04,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.

2148
02:34:05,378 --> 02:34:06,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you speed it up.

2149
02:34:06,439 --> 02:34:12,183
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, well, then I'm thinking kind of like 78, Matt.

2150
02:34:12,203 --> 02:34:12,364
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep.

2151
02:34:12,384 --> 02:34:16,427
[SPEAKER_22]: Just about all the ones in Max except for Stay and So Deep, which I'm close to So Deep.

2152
02:34:18,229 --> 02:34:20,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say, I think Twilight Zone is really easy.

2153
02:34:20,792 --> 02:34:21,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it depends.

2154
02:34:21,993 --> 02:34:24,355
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends if you, because there's two types of people.

2155
02:34:24,796 --> 02:34:27,199
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the people that can get the weird rhythms really easy.

2156
02:34:27,399 --> 02:34:31,844
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're that type of person, you can get Orion 7-8, I feel those kind of cat is no problem.

2157
02:34:32,711 --> 02:34:36,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I have issues with my stamina, partly from my asthma and having a bad knee and a bad ankle.

2158
02:34:55,697 --> 02:34:57,138
[SPEAKER_02]: First CATA you guys ever passed?

2159
02:34:57,498 --> 02:35:00,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Hypnotic Crisis Same here, Hypnotic Crisis What was the first CATA you ever passed, Loki?

2160
02:35:01,040 --> 02:35:06,702
[SPEAKER_03]: First CATA I passed was on doubles and that was Make Your Move Make Your Move Really?

2161
02:35:06,742 --> 02:35:07,502
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a CATA?

2162
02:35:07,743 --> 02:35:10,744
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a CATA Okay, second CATA you guys passed, do you remember?

2163
02:35:11,522 --> 02:35:22,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Gradius Exciter Mine was Orion 7-8 La Senorita Doubles I was better at doubles than I was singles for the longest time What was the first singles category you passed?

2164
02:35:23,027 --> 02:35:36,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I remember I think it was Dead End Oh, no, no, no, no, I do remember the easiest one to pass Paranoia Eternal, but with the fifth mix steps were heavy Ah, okay, Paranoia Eternal on fifth mix I know my favorite one Lupin, remember?

2165
02:35:36,732 --> 02:35:39,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Lupin, yeah I don't think Lupin's that easy, though

2166
02:35:40,525 --> 02:35:44,608
[SPEAKER_22]: We're at the party at one of our old Bitmoney parties back at the old group.

2167
02:35:44,688 --> 02:35:48,891
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, we're so old school that every cat is easy now.

2168
02:35:48,911 --> 02:35:49,752
[SPEAKER_22]: On a modded home pad.

2169
02:35:50,172 --> 02:35:51,973
[SPEAKER_22]: Went back a couple days later.

2170
02:35:52,934 --> 02:35:56,376
[SPEAKER_22]: That was actually right before the NGL 2.

2171
02:35:57,317 --> 02:36:00,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the hardest cats are the ones that run third mix, actually.

2172
02:36:01,319 --> 02:36:02,060
[SPEAKER_22]: I completely agree.

2173
02:36:02,080 --> 02:36:02,880
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, they upgraded...

2174
02:36:07,892 --> 02:36:12,855
[SPEAKER_22]: The Upgraded Paranoia Clean and End of the Century.

2175
02:36:12,895 --> 02:36:13,615
[SPEAKER_22]: I beat both of those.

2176
02:36:13,976 --> 02:36:14,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, the ones they have tonight.

2177
02:36:14,956 --> 02:36:15,857
[SPEAKER_22]: I beat Dead End.

2178
02:36:15,877 --> 02:36:17,237
[SPEAKER_22]: It actually took me a while to beat Dead End.

2179
02:36:17,257 --> 02:36:21,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Broken My Heart Sees You Scatter.

2180
02:36:21,960 --> 02:36:23,021
[SPEAKER_22]: And Burn the Floor.

2181
02:36:23,481 --> 02:36:23,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

2182
02:36:23,841 --> 02:36:24,541
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I meant.

2183
02:36:24,561 --> 02:36:25,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Burn the Floor.

2184
02:36:25,062 --> 02:36:25,402
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

2185
02:36:25,862 --> 02:36:26,542
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not really.

2186
02:36:26,582 --> 02:36:28,784
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what it's called.

2187
02:36:28,864 --> 02:36:31,965
[SPEAKER_22]: And I actually did legitimately get Captain Jack on 4K.

2188
02:36:31,985 --> 02:36:32,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Captain Jack's cool.

2189
02:36:33,366 --> 02:36:34,627
[SPEAKER_22]: And you remember how long I was working on this?

2190
02:36:34,647 --> 02:36:35,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I remember.

2191
02:36:35,127 --> 02:36:45,913
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the very... Because I passed every single kata, like, I was in that phase when 4th was still... No, when 5th... 5th was... That's kind of when I was... When 5th was kind of new.

2192
02:36:46,273 --> 02:36:49,575
[SPEAKER_02]: And Captain Jack was the very last kata I was able to do, which is kind of weird.

2193
02:36:50,235 --> 02:36:51,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Because most people pass it easy.

2194
02:36:51,436 --> 02:36:53,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it was a pain in the ass for me for some reason.

2195
02:36:53,697 --> 02:36:55,178
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of those, I beat first time.

2196
02:36:55,858 --> 02:37:01,200
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, although one I still to this day can't do because my knee always goes out of the same part on this as Exotic Ethnic.

2197
02:37:01,980 --> 02:37:03,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's one of the harder ones.

2198
02:37:04,961 --> 02:37:05,761
[SPEAKER_22]: You've seen it happen.

2199
02:37:06,021 --> 02:37:07,962
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll do Exotic Ethnic and then I'll go down.

2200
02:37:08,422 --> 02:37:09,402
[SPEAKER_22]: Literally, I will fall.

2201
02:37:10,063 --> 02:37:10,563
[SPEAKER_22]: You've seen it.

2202
02:37:10,743 --> 02:37:11,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Go down.

2203
02:37:12,983 --> 02:37:14,244
[SPEAKER_22]: You've seen me fall on this one.

2204
02:37:14,924 --> 02:37:21,570
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do have good stamina though, Wenda is actually not a bad one I don't know because I never kept track of that shit, I just peed everything

2205
02:37:42,860 --> 02:37:43,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're so late.

2206
02:37:44,022 --> 02:37:49,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I mean... Yeah.

2207
02:37:49,148 --> 02:37:52,212
[SPEAKER_22]: My first seven, though, was Let Them Move.

2208
02:37:52,232 --> 02:37:53,013
[SPEAKER_10]: What was Dead End?

2209
02:37:53,293 --> 02:37:54,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Dead End's a nine.

2210
02:37:54,475 --> 02:37:56,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay, because I beat that late.

2211
02:37:58,547 --> 02:37:59,548
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of people did, though.

2212
02:37:59,568 --> 02:38:02,149
[SPEAKER_22]: It was harder for me, but I think it was against my own age.

2213
02:38:03,370 --> 02:38:09,313
[SPEAKER_22]: I, um, one of the ones that I was really amazed I could get was Breakdown, though, because of the speed.

2214
02:38:09,934 --> 02:38:12,735
[SPEAKER_34]: Another real easy one would be, uh, Pernod, A Clean Mix.

2215
02:38:13,055 --> 02:38:13,316
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2216
02:38:13,696 --> 02:38:17,858
[SPEAKER_22]: But I remember when that was just an 8.

2217
02:38:18,178 --> 02:38:18,999
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, I feel it.

2218
02:38:20,360 --> 02:38:21,100
[SPEAKER_22]: I feel so easy.

2219
02:38:21,981 --> 02:38:22,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on.

2220
02:38:22,741 --> 02:38:23,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people complained about it.

2221
02:38:23,722 --> 02:38:25,803
[SPEAKER_22]: It actually does follow the pattern.

2222
02:38:27,304 --> 02:38:27,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2223
02:38:29,153 --> 02:38:38,259
[SPEAKER_02]: EOSFBB, if I were to have Vid Powah star in a porno in which he fucks chick on a DDR pad, what would be a good song to choreograph this freestyle of all freestyles to?

2224
02:38:38,279 --> 02:38:42,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Bomani related, yes, he does know about this, we are currently trying to cast a female.

2225
02:38:43,622 --> 02:38:44,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck.

2226
02:38:46,084 --> 02:38:47,344
[SPEAKER_20]: After the Game of Love.

2227
02:38:47,504 --> 02:38:50,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, After the Game of Love, definitely, or any erotic song.

2228
02:38:51,327 --> 02:38:52,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Secret Rendezvous.

2229
02:38:53,048 --> 02:38:53,608
[SPEAKER_02]: What mix?

2230
02:38:53,848 --> 02:38:54,729
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to know what mix.

2231
02:38:56,423 --> 02:38:59,789
[SPEAKER_22]: If they're going to do a porn, they fuck on the DDR pad, but they should be in the background.

2232
02:39:09,688 --> 02:39:13,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Say, I would like to hear... D-Level.

2233
02:39:13,910 --> 02:39:16,591
[SPEAKER_23]: D-Level would be pretty good, but I was thinking Orion.

2234
02:39:17,812 --> 02:39:18,932
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Boom Boom Dollar?

2235
02:39:18,992 --> 02:39:20,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he could, you know, rest on the rhythm.

2236
02:39:20,693 --> 02:39:21,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom, boom, boom.

2237
02:39:22,193 --> 02:39:25,155
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he could, like, be lip-syncing to Mighty Fine Dollar.

2238
02:39:25,635 --> 02:39:26,835
[SPEAKER_22]: No, Pink Dinosaur.

2239
02:39:27,095 --> 02:39:28,016
[SPEAKER_22]: Because it's about a penis.

2240
02:39:29,685 --> 02:39:30,906
[SPEAKER_03]: or, um, no, no, Walkie Talkie.

2241
02:39:31,786 --> 02:39:36,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Just have, okay, have multiple music, multiple different songs for each different scene.

2242
02:39:36,649 --> 02:39:38,710
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna have Blow My Whistle Bitch for the oral game.

2243
02:39:38,730 --> 02:39:40,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Blow My Whistle, well, this is the thing, this is the thing.

2244
02:39:40,731 --> 02:39:41,932
[SPEAKER_02]: EOSFBB gave me the mix.

2245
02:39:41,952 --> 02:39:45,334
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gonna try to close game land and do it and use DDR EX.

2246
02:39:45,774 --> 02:39:47,475
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't do Blow My Whistle Bitch, that's not in the EX.

2247
02:39:49,357 --> 02:39:54,403
[SPEAKER_15]: All I can say is I'm not going to do a hand clap on that machine ever again.

2248
02:39:54,743 --> 02:39:57,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, go ahead, shoot a porno here.

2249
02:39:58,688 --> 02:39:59,789
[SPEAKER_02]: He might be friends with the owner.

2250
02:40:01,691 --> 02:40:03,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you think he's going to let us shoot a porno?

2251
02:40:04,695 --> 02:40:05,075
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

2252
02:40:06,397 --> 02:40:07,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, maybe not.

2253
02:40:07,919 --> 02:40:09,300
[SPEAKER_22]: India's Family Entertainment.

2254
02:40:10,881 --> 02:40:11,822
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, next question.

2255
02:40:12,142 --> 02:40:12,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, next question.

2256
02:40:13,303 --> 02:40:14,984
[SPEAKER_02]: We gave you plenty of good songs to choose from.

2257
02:40:15,004 --> 02:40:15,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Pick one.

2258
02:40:15,865 --> 02:40:16,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I still say Butterfly.

2259
02:40:17,406 --> 02:40:19,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2260
02:40:20,048 --> 02:40:22,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Stressa says, I was playing AM radio today.

2261
02:40:22,109 --> 02:40:23,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit a 200 combo.

2262
02:40:23,290 --> 02:40:25,652
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear to God, this blue thing kind of reminded me of Tickman.

2263
02:40:25,672 --> 02:40:26,732
[SPEAKER_02]: The Tick, whatever his name is.

2264
02:40:26,813 --> 02:40:29,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Jump out from the right side of the screen and screeched at me.

2265
02:40:29,394 --> 02:40:30,195
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck was that?

2266
02:40:30,655 --> 02:40:32,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that something standard to an Oni course?

2267
02:40:33,692 --> 02:40:36,956
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's a thing, it's a joke from Mortal Kombat.

2268
02:40:37,097 --> 02:40:48,051
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes toasty, yeah, toasty, and it's just, it's a thing that's built into step media when you get, I think it's 150 perfects in a row or something like that.

2269
02:40:48,852 --> 02:40:50,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it, it happens all the time.

2270
02:40:50,393 --> 02:40:54,917
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, uh, actually, you have the new, you have different skins you can get.

2271
02:40:55,037 --> 02:40:58,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine right now is, uh, Casento, which is the blue thing that you were talking about.

2272
02:40:59,001 --> 02:41:07,067
[SPEAKER_03]: They also have, they have one with, uh, with Virtu, uh, wearing the DDR, uh, pad, and the, the helmet.

2273
02:41:07,968 --> 02:41:08,889
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hilarious.

2274
02:41:09,469 --> 02:41:13,873
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's part of the new DDR, that's the, uh, SM Extreme skin for that one.

2275
02:41:14,233 --> 02:41:15,414
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, it's pretty funny.

2276
02:41:15,494 --> 02:41:17,456
[SPEAKER_03]: You still need to have an Orange Lounge skin for Steppenwolf.

2277
02:41:19,122 --> 02:41:20,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't look at me, I'm not making one.

2278
02:41:20,382 --> 02:41:20,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

2279
02:41:21,142 --> 02:41:22,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuz, I'm lazy and I don't... Why not?

2280
02:41:22,523 --> 02:41:22,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on!

2281
02:41:22,883 --> 02:41:23,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do stands.

2282
02:41:23,723 --> 02:41:27,804
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true, I can't even finish... I can't even finish my One-Step Mania file I tried to make.

2283
02:41:27,844 --> 02:41:28,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, shit, man!

2284
02:41:29,244 --> 02:41:30,604
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna finish it and call it mine.

2285
02:41:30,984 --> 02:41:31,765
[SPEAKER_03]: No, bastard.

2286
02:41:33,605 --> 02:41:37,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so... Insertion.

2287
02:41:37,546 --> 02:41:38,046
[SPEAKER_34]: Insertion?

2288
02:41:38,626 --> 02:41:39,046
[SPEAKER_34]: What about it?

2289
02:41:40,166 --> 02:41:45,187
[SPEAKER_03]: XTC, yeah, but Insertion, I think... Every time I listen to Insertion, I'm thinking it's boring.

2290
02:41:45,227 --> 02:41:47,608
[SPEAKER_03]: It just sounds like boring music, it's got like... A lot of bass.

2291
02:41:49,199 --> 02:41:52,180
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone would send me the goddamn file.

2292
02:41:52,200 --> 02:41:52,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I have it.

2293
02:42:18,695 --> 02:42:19,936
[SPEAKER_22]: and you better copy that for me.

2294
02:42:20,717 --> 02:42:21,778
[SPEAKER_22]: DCC me that later.

2295
02:42:22,018 --> 02:42:25,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I'll DCC it to Jamie and we play it on fuck-offs occasionally.

2296
02:42:25,781 --> 02:42:26,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that good enough?

2297
02:42:26,923 --> 02:42:28,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't shit we do here good enough for you?

2298
02:42:28,704 --> 02:42:29,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.

2299
02:42:31,046 --> 02:42:33,368
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the part where Brad's supposed to go, where?

2300
02:42:34,770 --> 02:42:35,470
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll think about it.

2301
02:42:38,365 --> 02:42:39,206
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no more questions.

2302
02:42:39,226 --> 02:42:39,886
[SPEAKER_02]: We're out of questions.

2303
02:42:41,548 --> 02:42:42,348
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a question, Jamie?

2304
02:42:42,569 --> 02:42:43,710
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to ask Orange Law something?

2305
02:42:43,950 --> 02:42:44,730
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to ask a question.

2306
02:42:44,770 --> 02:42:45,271
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a question.

[SPEAKER_02]: All right, fine.

2311
02:42:49,014 --> 02:42:51,416
[SPEAKER_02]: When they don't ask us questions, we're going to ask them questions.

2312
02:42:51,436 --> 02:42:52,817
[SPEAKER_22]: Why won't you ask us another question?

2313
02:42:54,679 --> 02:42:57,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, I think you're going to ask him something good.

2314
02:42:57,081 --> 02:43:00,804
[SPEAKER_22]: I want you to send me some nice yaoi.

2343
02:44:13,565 --> 02:44:14,226
[SPEAKER_22]: Slow.

2344
02:44:14,826 --> 02:44:21,852
[SPEAKER_21]: It was really neat to see the male turtle standing up, leaning on the shell of the female turtle, go, vroom, vroom.

2345
02:44:25,144 --> 02:44:26,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he make a vump sound when he did it?

2346
02:44:26,924 --> 02:44:29,305
[SPEAKER_22]: No, but it was like that slow.

2347

02:44:50,621 --> 02:44:51,462
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a question.

2354
02:44:52,362 --> 02:44:52,823
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an order.

02:44:53,823 --> 02:44:54,024
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

02:44:54,064 --> 02:44:55,204

[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the ferret.

2362
02:45:06,672 --> 02:45:09,414
[SPEAKER_02]: 23rd Magus wants to know, are y'all happy for us?

2363

2369
02:45:24,630 --> 02:45:27,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2370
02:45:29,575 --> 02:45:30,857

02:45:30,917 --> 02:45:31,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there's the yo-yo, I see it.

2372
02:45:32,058 --> 02:45:32,478
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the ground.

2373
02:45:32,959 --> 02:45:33,339
[SPEAKER_02]: It's over there.

2374
02:45:34,120 --> 02:45:34,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2375
02:45:35,361 --> 02:45:38,605
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take a quick break, and we're going to come back and wrap up this train wreck of a show.

2376
02:45:39,325 --> 02:45:39,786
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back.

2377
02:45:42,719 --> 02:45:43,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Take us to break, Jamie.

2378
02:45:43,740 --> 02:45:44,201
[SPEAKER_18]: Yo-yo.

2379
02:45:46,163 --> 02:45:46,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a rapper?

2380
02:45:46,924 --> 02:45:47,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo-yo-yo?

2381
02:45:47,545 --> 02:45:48,806
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, play with my yo-yo.

2382
02:45:49,407 --> 02:45:49,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2383
02:45:49,667 --> 02:45:50,428
[SPEAKER_18]: Try to play me out.

2384
02:45:50,648 --> 02:45:51,129
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back.

2385
02:47:18,624 --> 02:47:28,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, every night

2386
02:49:34,053 --> 02:49:35,254
Thanks for watching!

2387
02:52:01,134 --> 02:52:01,714
VOG Network!

2388
02:52:01,754 --> 02:52:01,894
Loki!

2389
02:52:28,456 --> 02:52:35,297
[SPEAKER_14]: Jojo, Miyato, Okaza, Tosuke, Jojo

2390
02:53:17,665 --> 02:53:23,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Meow, Meow.

2391
02:53:23,692 --> 02:53:24,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, ass!

2392
02:53:24,773 --> 02:53:27,457
[SPEAKER_01]: This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

2393
02:53:31,141 --> 02:53:33,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2394
02:53:35,046 --> 02:53:36,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki wanted to talk about how he's going to be famous.

2395
02:53:39,077 --> 02:53:39,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, which is Mike.

2396
02:53:39,717 --> 02:53:42,659
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not going to be famous, but it was cool.

2397
02:53:42,759 --> 02:53:48,681
[SPEAKER_03]: This weekend we went down to Scandia to actually be interviewed by someone for their school paper.

2398
02:53:48,701 --> 02:53:49,782
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was fun.

2399
02:53:50,082 --> 02:53:51,123
[SPEAKER_03]: And she listens to the show.

2400
02:53:52,183 --> 02:53:53,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool!

2401
02:53:53,504 --> 02:53:54,224
[SPEAKER_03]: We have fans.

2402
02:53:54,684 --> 02:53:55,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

2403
02:53:56,025 --> 02:53:57,706
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know that actually someone listens to our show.

2404
02:53:58,786 --> 02:53:59,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.

2405
02:53:59,466 --> 02:54:08,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the song, by the way, that we played, the last song before we came back was Dancer, which, by the way, is the best 2DX8 style video ever.

2406
02:54:09,032 --> 02:54:17,216
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were talking during the break about, because some of you out there have been demanding that we update our website with our bios because they haven't been up for a while.

2407
02:54:17,996 --> 02:54:19,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki has never had a bio on the site.

2408
02:54:20,418 --> 02:54:20,898
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry.

2409
02:54:21,078 --> 02:54:23,780
[SPEAKER_22]: I need a picture of me with my real nose and not a Photoshop nose.

2410
02:54:24,560 --> 02:54:27,622
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to admit, though, Glenn did interesting work with those.

2411
02:54:27,702 --> 02:54:28,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

2412
02:54:29,014 --> 02:54:30,756
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't look anything like myself.

2413
02:54:30,836 --> 02:54:33,098
[SPEAKER_22]: Excuse me, I don't look like I'm made out of plastic.

2414
02:54:33,738 --> 02:54:35,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they did look like we were made out of plastic.

2415
02:54:35,560 --> 02:54:36,941
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't have a Barbra Streisand nose.

2416
02:54:37,522 --> 02:54:38,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a big nose too, hey.

2417
02:54:38,923 --> 02:54:44,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyway, we're going to take some new pictures of ourselves and we're talking about which 2DX videos we're going to parody to do the pictures of.

2418
02:54:44,167 --> 02:54:45,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to parody a 2DX video.

2419
02:54:45,709 --> 02:54:46,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't play 2DX.

2420
02:54:46,950 --> 02:54:49,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're just going to dress you up like a pimp because you're the porn king.

2421
02:54:49,772 --> 02:54:50,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a porn king.

2422
02:54:50,733 --> 02:54:51,594
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't even own that much.

2423
02:54:51,614 --> 02:54:52,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up, you're the porn king.

2424
02:54:54,376 --> 02:54:54,996
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, chat room.

2425
02:54:55,497 --> 02:54:55,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat room.

2426
02:54:56,277 --> 02:54:57,077
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we dressing?

2427
02:54:57,157 --> 02:54:58,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I want chat room to vote then.

2428
02:54:58,338 --> 02:55:00,798
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we dressing up Loki for his picture on the bio page?

2429
02:55:01,499 --> 02:55:05,240
[SPEAKER_02]: We already decided Jamie's going to do the dancer scary Barbie chick girl.

2430
02:55:06,120 --> 02:55:06,721
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be funny.

2431
02:55:07,861 --> 02:55:09,382
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be a cowgirl.

2432
02:55:10,882 --> 02:55:12,303
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll shave your head in odd ways.

2433
02:55:12,323 --> 02:55:14,323
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to set your hair on fire and take a picture.

2434
02:55:16,084 --> 02:55:17,745
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're not setting my hair on fire.

2435
02:55:17,925 --> 02:55:19,886
[SPEAKER_03]: I could wear my trench coat and my glasses out.

2436
02:55:19,926 --> 02:55:20,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

2437
02:55:20,386 --> 02:55:21,086
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

2438
02:55:21,542 --> 02:55:21,822
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2439
02:55:21,842 --> 02:55:23,583
[SPEAKER_22]: That would actually be from a 2DX video.

2440
02:55:23,763 --> 02:55:25,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, ah, beautiful, beautiful.

2441
02:55:25,543 --> 02:55:26,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Snub, Dysphenoid, got it.

2442
02:55:26,663 --> 02:55:26,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Stoic.

2443
02:55:27,864 --> 02:55:29,004
[SPEAKER_02]: We're dressing up like the Stoic video.

2444
02:55:29,024 --> 02:55:29,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2445
02:55:29,464 --> 02:55:29,804
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2446
02:55:29,984 --> 02:55:30,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2447
02:55:30,404 --> 02:55:31,405
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be our tag.

2448
02:55:31,425 --> 02:55:31,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Winner.

2449
02:55:31,745 --> 02:55:32,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, guys.

2450
02:55:32,585 --> 02:55:32,825
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2451
02:55:32,865 --> 02:55:35,566
[SPEAKER_22]: But don't be offended if I don't drool over you.

2452
02:55:35,586 --> 02:55:36,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Stoic it is.

2453
02:55:36,106 --> 02:55:36,486
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

2454
02:55:37,266 --> 02:55:39,907
[SPEAKER_22]: But we need to actually Photoshop in a Tran next to him.

2455
02:55:40,007 --> 02:55:40,287
[SPEAKER_02]: We will.

2456
02:55:41,427 --> 02:55:44,792
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm going to dress up as the chick from the last message video.

2457
02:55:45,573 --> 02:55:48,476
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only fitting since I sit on the ground all the time.

2458
02:55:48,496 --> 02:55:50,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so just sit on the ground all the time.

2459
02:55:50,499 --> 02:55:52,461
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I get to be the girlfriend dancer.

2460
02:55:52,481 --> 02:55:53,462
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to bring in a Barbie.

2461
02:55:54,323 --> 02:55:55,425
[SPEAKER_22]: One of my gothed out Barbies.

2462
02:55:57,694 --> 02:55:58,375
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

2463
02:56:19,458 --> 02:56:33,333
[SPEAKER_22]: I had this weird phase I went through where I was buying Barbies because I... Alright, when I was in third grade I let all my Barbies mold and then I just went off and played with my Transformers and then suddenly I realized that the Barbies that came out for a little while were actually kind of cool except I wanted to alter them.

2464
02:56:36,153 --> 02:56:36,893
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I did.

2465
02:56:37,513 --> 02:56:37,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Into what?

2466
02:56:38,334 --> 02:56:39,434
[SPEAKER_22]: I would actually make their clothes.

2467
02:56:40,034 --> 02:56:40,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's cool.

2468
02:56:40,394 --> 02:56:42,155
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm a little fashion designer.

2469
02:56:42,215 --> 02:56:43,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to want to be a fashion designer.

2470
02:56:43,475 --> 02:56:44,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you fashion design for G.I.

2471
02:56:44,636 --> 02:56:45,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe, too?

2472
02:56:45,056 --> 02:56:45,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he needed it.

2473
02:56:46,616 --> 02:56:47,676
[SPEAKER_22]: No, because you know what?

2474
02:56:47,696 --> 02:56:48,917
[SPEAKER_22]: They never came out with the G.I.

2475
02:56:48,937 --> 02:56:49,597
[SPEAKER_22]: Joe that had hair.

2476
02:56:50,157 --> 02:56:50,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's true.

2477
02:56:51,218 --> 02:56:52,678
[SPEAKER_22]: I wanted Earring Magic Ken, though.

2478
02:56:52,698 --> 02:56:54,899
[SPEAKER_22]: Because Earring Magic Ken came with a cock ring.

2479
02:56:57,019 --> 02:56:57,579
[SPEAKER_22]: Seriously.

2480
02:56:58,040 --> 02:57:02,741
[SPEAKER_22]: And the guy admitted that when he designed them, that the pendant he wore around his neck really was a cock ring.

2481
02:57:05,225 --> 02:57:06,146
[SPEAKER_22]: And they took it off the market.

2482
02:57:06,206 --> 02:57:06,486
[SPEAKER_22]: Dot, dot, dot.

2483
02:57:06,606 --> 02:57:11,649
[SPEAKER_22]: I bet if you look up eBay and look up Earring Magic Ken, then they're going to be bugs.

2484
02:57:12,430 --> 02:57:13,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

2485
02:57:13,390 --> 02:57:13,510
Yeah.

2486
02:57:13,871 --> 02:57:14,211
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2487
02:57:14,231 --> 02:57:14,911
[SPEAKER_22]: A little known fact.

2488
02:57:15,872 --> 02:57:17,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2489
02:57:17,993 --> 02:57:21,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, well, we're going to get around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night.

2490
02:57:21,796 --> 02:57:24,598
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, I want to say, we didn't even talk about this on the show tonight.

2491
02:57:24,658 --> 02:57:26,099
[SPEAKER_02]: It's completely Vimani-related.

2492
02:57:26,199 --> 02:57:28,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge topic that came up this week.

2493
02:57:28,220 --> 02:57:30,021
[SPEAKER_02]: We totally forgot to talk about it.

2494
02:57:30,281 --> 02:57:31,182
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about it next week.

2495
02:57:31,842 --> 02:57:33,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Max 2 is announced for the USA.

2496
02:57:35,365 --> 02:57:36,106
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2497
02:57:54,620 --> 02:57:55,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, you know what?

2498
02:57:55,782 --> 02:57:58,046
[SPEAKER_02]: We should play instruments live on the show.

2499
02:57:58,066 --> 02:57:59,708
[SPEAKER_02]: You should bring in a sax and I can bring in my clarinet.

2500
02:57:59,748 --> 02:58:00,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one.

2501
02:58:00,790 --> 02:58:01,050
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2502
02:58:01,070 --> 02:58:01,751
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a clarinet anyway.

2503
02:58:01,771 --> 02:58:03,775
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe if I got my own mouthpiece or something.

2504
02:58:03,855 --> 02:58:06,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just bring in a skin flute for you to play, Rob.

2505
02:58:10,043 --> 02:58:11,064
[SPEAKER_22]: Only 99 cents a minute, don't you know, child?

2506
02:58:11,084 --> 02:58:11,744
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all in the cards.

2507
02:58:40,165 --> 02:58:41,426
[SPEAKER_22]: Why are you looking at me when you say that?

2508
02:58:41,506 --> 02:58:41,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2509
02:58:42,907 --> 02:58:43,427
[SPEAKER_02]: You're sexy.

2510
02:58:43,467 --> 02:58:45,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss Cleo loves the Jamie.

2511
02:58:46,449 --> 02:58:49,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss Cleo likes the big black cock.

2512
02:58:49,751 --> 02:58:51,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss Cleo wants to shove this turban up your ass.

2513
02:58:52,913 --> 02:58:55,976
[SPEAKER_22]: Miss Cleo likes the big black cock.

2514
02:58:56,056 --> 02:58:59,598
[SPEAKER_22]: She has a big black cock going out of her head and she keeps it wrapped up in the turban.

2515
02:59:00,609 --> 02:59:02,390
[SPEAKER_22]: She actually has Voldemort on the back of her head.

2516
02:59:02,570 --> 02:59:03,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Dot, dot, dot.

2517
02:59:04,131 --> 02:59:07,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go around and give everybody's final thoughts.

2518
02:59:07,952 --> 02:59:10,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting with our guest, Brad, your final thought for the day.

2519
02:59:10,093 --> 02:59:10,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a ninja.

2520
02:59:10,814 --> 02:59:11,394
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a ninja.

2521
02:59:11,594 --> 02:59:11,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2522
02:59:12,374 --> 02:59:14,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, or Loki, your final thoughts for the day.

2523
02:59:15,075 --> 02:59:15,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I like FLCL.

2524
02:59:15,836 --> 02:59:22,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on!

2525
02:59:22,959 --> 02:59:28,961
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is that Stapler X is saying Sky's Voice the game is going to be released in July of 2003, and that scares me!

2526
02:59:29,662 --> 02:59:29,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

2527
02:59:31,022 --> 02:59:33,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, the truck have started to move.

2528
02:59:33,664 --> 02:59:35,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's my final thought of the day.

2529
02:59:35,325 --> 02:59:36,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, the truck have started to move.

2530
02:59:39,047 --> 02:59:41,389
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that Square is top shape in all the world.

2531
02:59:43,050 --> 02:59:44,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night everybody, thanks for listening.

2532
02:59:44,731 --> 02:59:46,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, actually... Eat children!

2533
02:59:46,572 --> 02:59:48,053
[SPEAKER_02]: One more quick thing.

2534
02:59:48,873 --> 02:59:53,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually Jamie is the person behind, the mastermind behind the fortune cookie message of the day.

2535
02:59:53,496 --> 02:59:54,997
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I was going to play the Eggo and Company.

2536
02:59:55,365 --> 03:00:00,027
[SPEAKER_02]: However, tonight I decided I'm going to interrupt and put in a special fortune cookie message.

2537
03:00:00,928 --> 03:00:03,149
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit kind of sentimental.

2538
03:00:03,429 --> 03:00:10,772
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a dedication because there's somebody out there that really, when I was a child, indeed anyway.

2539
03:00:10,792 --> 03:00:12,333
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you guys laughing at?

2540
03:00:12,373 --> 03:00:13,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to have a serious moment here.

2541
03:00:13,753 --> 03:00:14,434
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys suck.

2542
03:00:15,154 --> 03:00:17,055
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are playing Candy King.

2543
03:00:17,595 --> 03:00:21,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say, no, seriously, this is a dedication to Fortune Cookie Message.

2544
03:00:21,677 --> 03:00:27,840
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was a young child, there was somebody I was definitely inspired by that I used to watch every week.

2545
03:00:27,900 --> 03:00:29,921
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the first shows that I watched all the time.

2546
03:00:29,941 --> 03:00:30,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I am crying.

2547
03:00:30,802 --> 03:00:36,605
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was definitely influenced by this person and part of the reason that I think I like to entertain.

2548
03:00:37,065 --> 03:00:38,966
[SPEAKER_02]: So, kind of a serious Fortune Cookie Night.

2549
03:00:39,646 --> 03:00:40,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Caning Rob.

2550
03:00:40,707 --> 03:00:41,768
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very sad.

2551
03:00:42,109 --> 03:00:45,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely had a big... I had a big cry this week.

2552
03:00:48,334 --> 03:00:48,915
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Rob.

2553
03:00:48,955 --> 03:00:49,936
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys always ruin it.

2554
03:00:50,116 --> 03:00:50,576
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright.

2555
03:00:50,876 --> 03:00:52,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night, you guys.

2556
03:00:52,998 --> 03:00:53,519
