1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh! Message for you, son!

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In this episode...

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hey, is any balls down there?

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's the biggest berry you ever seen, Dingleberry.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What's your favorite security movie?

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Showgirls. Absolutely frightful.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What's yours?

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now's the time on Sprockets and me dogs!

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog too!

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I know kung fu.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No! What I expect from a punishing physician is a joke.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Hey!

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Dark Sakura.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Shut up!

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Where's my gun? This is my boomstick!

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Sky.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What kind of what human being would find that funny?

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Orange Lounge Radio

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We are live, and this is episode number 30 for January the 26th of 2003.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You're tuned into the Burmani Scene's most apocalyptic radio station of all things Beymani.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Ms. Jamie Summers

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
you know her better as Dark Sakura

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
she does not sound very enjoyed today, I'm sorry

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
okay, we're having some of our feedback issues tonight with the mics

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
what? to what?

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
no, I barely have enough to say this, don't reach my head

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We all just are having some mic feedback tonight, goddammit.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We did a system reset and everything.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's see if we can work on that.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We need a mixing board for this damn show.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Okay, anyway, also in the house,

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
say hello to our tech master Loki.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
How you doing?

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I also have special guests in the studio tonight, except they're all in the other room, so fuck them.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
They don't exist to me!

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh, here they come. Here I come.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Didn't he just say he sucks on the dick sore?

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Hello, dick suck sore!

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Who are the dick suck sore?

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It would not be nice to have a sore.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Introduce yourselves for the listing on Inclusive.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Oh yeah, I hear everything.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh, thanks. I was going to do this. Yeah, I'm Ryan, AKA SDMX, whatever you like.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
No, we don't have the dead airspace because we have that annoying mike coming.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:56,760
We're going to start right off the gate tonight with tonight's list list and we'll be right

55
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,280
back after this break with a list list.

56
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,240
To start off tonight we're going to play a little song that's really popular in DDR Extreme.

57
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:10,240
They came over for pop music, and all you kids love it. It's called Daikenkai! Enjoy.

58
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:30,800
I just need my love for you I need to know, I need to know, I need to

59
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:52,000
I need to know, I need to know, I need to know how you feel

60
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,100
I'm giving all my heart to You, my love

61
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,260
I just divide my love for You

62
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,840
I'm giving You my heart, my soul, my love

63
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,360
I just divide my love for You

64
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,620
I just divide my love for You

65
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,220
I'm giving all my heart to You, my love

66
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,860
I just divide my love for You

67
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,040
I'm giving You my heart, my soul, my love

68
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:43,000
And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's

69
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,840
favorite perverse baumanni band, Erotic.

70
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Do it all night. Do it with me.

71
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,840
No, no! That was awful! Bloody terrible! Do you take vocal lessons? Kill your teacher!

72
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
In the heat of the night!

73
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,840
Oh god, I think my ears are bleeding!

74
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,840
I liked it!

75
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,840
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula! Next!

76
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,840
Oh... that was cool...

77
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,840
Do you even know why you're here? That was just bloody pathetic! Next!

78
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,840
Oh, come on baby, come on, do it with me

79
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,440
really loud into the mics tonight.

80
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Okay!

81
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
Just like that.

82
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Good job.

83
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Can you hear us?

84
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Hi!

85
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,960
So, uh, we apologize for the humming, but our, uh, my computer just sucks.

86
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,040
I think they like it when you hum.

87
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,480
Anyway, yes.

88
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:09,200
I, uh, I dusted off that erotic, uh, promo because American Idol 2 premiered this week.

89
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,240
I don't know if anybody out there gives a shit about American Idol anymore, but I watched

90
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
it.

91
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,880
American Idol makes me shit.

92
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,040
I hate Irene, by the way, Elisa Jellman.

93
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
That was funny.

94
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,960
They had people on there that really suck.

95
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:32,320
Like that guy that they're going to show next week, who's singing, oh fuck, but he's like

96
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
a virgin.

97
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
Yeah.

98
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Yeah.

99
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
Like a virgin?

100
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
No.

101
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
You are a virgin.

102
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,080
is going to touch you with a ten-foot pole.

103
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
Okay?

104
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,800
My god, it's like,

105
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,840
let's get like some uh... cracked out baby,

106
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:54,080
raise him up to be a pop idol, and put him on the show. Oh wait, now he's stupid.

107
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,860
I love this American Idol 2 show because I like crap,

108
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,260
and uh... there's just, there's a lot of really...

109
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,040
I don't know, I think I'm sick or something because I love watching Simon

110
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:12,040
here

111
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,860
channel pound orange lounge is requesting our chat room by the way if

112
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,420
you want to join our website orangelounge.skie.cx

113
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,560
they're requesting a Hummer

114
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,960
beautiful

115
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,760
you know what we used to do, which is quite funny, we had this giant

116
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,500
giant subwoofer

117
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,600
at uh...

118
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,240
and people used to sit on it and then we used to yell into the mic. Women liked it, I don't

119
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:46,240
know. That was done on the Howard Stern movie. Yeah. Been there, done that high. Anyway,

120
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,080
oh yeah, we were looking at the rating books. Damn you! We looked at the ratings books from

121
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:58,200
last week's show, by the way, and I will be getting drunk on every episode now from here

122
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,380
on out after that

123
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,920
hope you guys enjoyed that

124
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,980
although we did find out something. You're not going to be here for my junk show. I know I was just going to say we found out something a little

125
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,220
unfortunate. I'm not going to be here for the President's Day show because that's the same weekend

126
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,660
that's the same weekend as Cyberbeat Nation and I'll be down there

127
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,880
Screw that tournament, this is my 5 year anniversary

128
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,300
I think you already gave an F.U. to that tournament a few weeks ago. I'm going to give it another one, so fuck it

129
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,560
alright

130
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:35,680
Anyway, as promised, we're going to start off tonight's show with a list-less segment,

131
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,440
because we usually do it at the end of the show, but tonight we're going to do it at

132
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,340
the beginning of the show, because we want to talk about something that's going on right

133
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:46,720
now, right this very minute that is preventing our usual amounts of listeners from turning

134
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,260
out in droves.

135
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,600
What's going on, Jamie?

136
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,640
Other than you about ready to get whopped with this microphone?

137
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,640
Fucking stupid bull.

138
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,640
Oh, what's actually happening is, um...

139
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,640
The raiders are sucking more ass than they've ever sucked in their ass.

140
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,640
The raiders are bending over while...

141
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,640
While the computer's headed to the violin.

142
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
This is in their rectal cavity.

143
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,640
And firing.

144
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
Y'all just jealous.

145
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
Because y'all...

146
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,640
I wish I could lose by 30 points! Woo!

147
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,640
I'm sorry, but at this point, the collective asshole of the Raiders is cavernous.

148
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,640
Maybe I should go check out the scores. Maybe things turned around.

149
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,640
You know what's funny?

150
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,640
What, by two points, maybe?

151
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,640
I wonder if there's going to be rioting in San Diego tonight when the Raiders lose really badly.

152
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Because, like, I don't know if you guys heard, but the whole town of San Diego was kind of bracing themselves for Raiders fans.

153
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,640
Because San Diego is only about an eight hour drive from Oakland.

154
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,640
So, you know, a lot of those insane people that like to burn things are going to drive down there.

155
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
there

156
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
so

157
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
you're gonna be here in al-qaeda

158
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
oh man

159
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,640
i can't wait to see that

160
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
they're gonna riot goodness

161
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,200
they're gonna blame it on al-qaeda

162
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
it's not big

163
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,920
it's not oakland it's not san diego

164
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
that's al-qaeda

165
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,760
al-qaeda wanted the raiders to win

166
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,760
but yeah

167
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
yeah

168
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,320
well i still stand by my word for it it's the stupid bull

169
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
remember america

170
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,880
although the commercials are pretty funny

171
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,240
remember america

172
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,440
if the raiders lose the terrorists win

173
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
it.

174
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,760
Um, see, this is what's going to happen, this is what's going to happen when the Raiders

175
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,760
lose the Super Bowl.

176
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:32,480
They're going to drop the bomb on the 10th day to go.

177
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,480
Yeah, it was totally unnecessary.

178
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:41,000
Anyway, oh yes, our list list, hi.

179
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,720
We're going to be doing a list list tonight.

180
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,860
Top three things, or top thing, because we do have one thing.

181
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,240
Top things that we'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl.

182
00:14:53,240 --> 00:15:02,560
I just want you to stop.

183
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,980
Yeah, so tonight's list list.

184
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,500
three things we'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl except two of

185
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:17,660
our guests just ran out of studio so we can't even but the way listless works we

186
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:25,460
all will read our top three choices and then the fun part we have we have to go

187
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,940
around the room and each person will remove one thing from that list they

188
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,100
came up to took from 3 to 21 and 34 they're in the fourth quarter open oh my

189
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,100
My Gods!

190
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,100
They still have a chance.

191
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,100
Yeah, whatever.

192
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,100
I know none of you care!

193
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,100
Anyway, um.

194
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,100
Here we go.

195
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,100
Somebody else got lazy.

196
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,100
Anyway, yes, the topic.

197
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,100
Top three things we'd rather be doing than watch the Super Bowl.

198
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:53,340
Alright, and then the chat room, you guys will get to vote on what ends up being the

199
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,820
ultimate list.

200
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,140
If you want to vote, join our chat room now.

201
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:04,140
Just go to our webpage at orangeloungelounge.skie.cx

202
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,140
They had the Matrix commercial in there for the two new Matrix movies coming out.

203
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,140
Pretty fucking cool guys.

204
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,140
I'm excited.

205
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,140
I'm wet.

206
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,140
I'm sure they're already online.

207
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,140
In fact, I think somebody in our channel, I think EOSFVB already has a copy of them.

208
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,140
I'm seeing that movie at least eight times when it comes out.

209
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,140
That's one thing about the Matrix movies, I can see them over and over again.

210
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,140
I'm still entertained every time.

211
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,140
It's like Jamie with Harry Potter.

212
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,140
Yeah.

213
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:56,140
Except Harry Potter doesn't do fucking martial arts and shit.

214
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,140
It's cool. It's cool.

215
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,140
That would be cool.

216
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,140
Harry Potter!

217
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,140
Did you know it was on...

218
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,140
I think it's the smoking gun or something?

219
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,140
Mm-mm.

220
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,140
They had a drug bust of a shipment of SSC pills from...

221
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,140
Yes, I did see that with a Harry Potter's logo.

222
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,140
Yeah, with the big HP on them.

223
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,140
Alright, anyway.

224
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,140
Let's start. Let's read off our list.

225
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,140
We'll start with Brad.

226
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,140
Number three thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

227
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,140
Good, because I know somebody else is already going to pick this.

228
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,140
Playing 2DX.

229
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,140
Playing 2DX.

230
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,140
Damn.

231
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,140
All right.

232
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,140
Loki, your number three thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

233
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,140
Since I really don't give a shit at all, I didn't even make a list, so I'm just going to pull random shit out of my head.

234
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,140
All right, go for it.

235
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,140
We'll go with number three with shaving a monkey.

236
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,140
Shaving a monkey.

237
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,540
seconds of fun till it poos on your face.

238
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:29,140
My number three thing is having the rest of my wisdom teeth pulled while I'm awake.

239
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,800
Having the rest of your wisdom teeth pulled while you're awake.

240
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,300
I'll be numb, but I refuse to be put to sleep. They have to be done anyway. But I'm not going

241
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,300
to let them put me to sleep. I'm just going to tell them to numb the fuck out of my mouth

242
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:48,300
and I don't want an IV. If I got an IV, okay, my hand would be blue.

243
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,300
I have a pocket, yeah I do have a pocket, I'm asleep.

244
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,300
Anyway.

245
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,300
Brad's amused by the pocket on my sleeve.

246
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,300
Alright, so far so good.

247
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,300
It's for your cigarettes, right?

248
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,300
We got some beautiful choices.

249
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,300
Wait, you know this one?

250
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,300
Brad, number two thing you'd rather be doing than watch the Super Bowl?

251
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,300
Winning the lottery.

252
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:08,300
Winning the lottery!

253
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,300
One thing that goes without saying, shit man.

254
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,300
Great.

255
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,300
I'd rather be winning the lottery than doing this show.

256
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,300
Loki, the number two thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

257
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:26,300
Well, this alludes to later on in the show, but watching Ally McFeel.

258
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:34,300
Watching Ally McFeel, and if you want to know what the hell that is all about, then stay tuned after the next break.

259
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:39,300
Alright, Ryan, the number two thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

260
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,700
of a plug, but boy, I'd rather be working at GameStop in Arden Fair Mall, where you

261
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:49,540
can reserve all your greatest new games coming out soon, like Legend of Zelda.

262
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,340
Which I reserved the other day. If you don't reserve them there, I'll kill

263
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:57,800
you, because my man is just lost. Alright, so working at GameStop at Arden

264
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,160
Fair Mall. I'm trying to be my bitch forever.

265
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,960
Are you sure you want the entire world, literally, because this is an international show, you

266
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:09,240
want the entire world to know where you work? If you don't come and reserve things and be

267
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,240
He eats me quite often.

268
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,240
It hurts.

269
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,240
Alright.

270
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,400
But it's also entertaining to watch.

271
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,920
Number two thing I would rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl, napping.

272
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,920
Good call.

273
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,920
I'd rather be taking a nap.

274
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Alright.

275
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,280
Jamie, number two thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

276
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,960
Buying more Propel.

277
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:37,000
And drinking it.

278
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Buying more Propel and drinking it.

279
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:47,000
The number one thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

280
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,720
Jacking my hot spicy boner.

281
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:56,360
Jacking my hot spicy boner.

282
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,480
Loki, the number one thing that you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

283
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,000
He took mine!

284
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
No, I have my own boner.

285
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Anyways, um, well shit, uh, no! Although, no, um, I'd rather be, uh, killing stupid

286
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,360
people. Killing, killing stupid people. What? Wait, wait, wait, hold on. Maybe I'm just

287
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,240
going to change that. Fine, how about this? Getting laid. There. Getting laid, alright.

288
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:41,240
Alright, Ryan, you're number one thing you'd rather be doing than what you're supposed to be.

289
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,240
I gotcha, I'll be. I'm totally going to win this vote here.

290
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:53,240
Big black cock! B-I-G-B-L-A-C-K-C-O-C-K, people! Big black cock!

291
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,240
That was really gay.

292
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,240
So you'd rather be doing A big black cock?

293
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,240
That's gay.

294
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,240
I'm not doing it. It's just, they're, just, just quit it, just quit it.

295
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,240
He just wants it to exist instead of it being capable.

296
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,240
There shall be a big black cock for the masses.

297
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:17,240
And all shall worship it and be happy. And lo, God was pleased by a big black cock.

298
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,240
Blasphemy. Blasphemy.

299
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,240
My number one thing that I put was masturbating.

300
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,300
That was not actually a stress of PM to me that I should say that and I actually already had it written down come on

301
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,540
You people know me. I put masturbating unfortunately. That's kind of already on the list, so I'll say

302
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:41,780
Mine was a hot spicy boners yours could be here could be mild. No. I think I'm gonna change it

304
00:22:46,080 --> 00:23:00,600
ass. So I'm putting, get fucked up the ass. Hmm. We could arrange this. And you know what?

305
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,840
That's not a gay thing. It's just, seriously, I, even if I were straight, I'd rather be

306
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,240
getting fucked up the ass than watching the Super Bowl. I think you're infringing on the

Brad!

342
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,140
Ah!

343
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,660
Beware, I live.

344
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,500
Okay.

345
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,320
Yeah!

346
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,160
My hunger!

347
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,000
Yeah!

348
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,980
This has to come off the list.

349
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,820
Yeah!

350
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,820
One of these has to come off the list.

351
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,820
I'm not a big fan of the big black cock.

352
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,820
Oh, big black cock! First thing to go from the list.

353
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,820
Do not attack me while holding the microphone.

354
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,820
Don't pick on Brad, I would have taken it off too.

355
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,820
Alright, Brad's taken off big black cock.

356
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,820
Loki, one of these has to come off the list.

357
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,820
Um, as much of a fan as I am of pain.

358
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,820
Wait, no I'm not. So, wisdom teeth pulling while awake is coming off the list.

359
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,820
It doesn't hurt.

360
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,820
Alright.

361
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,820
I fell asleep.

362
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,820
I fell asleep when my wisdom teeth was pulled.

363
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,820
Where's Ryan?

364
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,820
I'm afraid of the dentist, so there.

365
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,820
Ryan, something's gotta come off this list.

366
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:58,820
Um, hmm. Well there's no really, any other, much other reasons to go to Scandia rather than 2DX and Xtreme, and 2DX is already on the list, so I'm going to remove Go to Scandia.

367
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,820
Hey!

368
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,820
Alright, fine.

369
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,820
We love Scandia.

370
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:12,820
Um, I'm going to take off the list, I'm going to take off watching Ally McFeel, as great as that porno is, we haven't even talked about it yet, so there's no way in hell it's going to get a vote anyway, so it's kind of pointless.

371
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,820
Being the token female, I'm going to take off the hot spicy boner.

372
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,820
I simply don't have one to know what the experience is like.

373
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:25,820
I'd just like to point out that through all the guys in this room, getting fucked up the ass remained on the list.

374
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,820
So, like I said, it's not a gay thing.

375
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:35,820
It's just funny sounding, and we'll get votes and we won't have to win because it's funny and random.

376
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,820
Yeah.

377
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,820
Alright.

378
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,820
She likes it in the ass.

379
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:47,820
So, these are your choices, and you can send me your votes right now in private message in the chat room, or you can send them over email to orangelaunchradio.com, but you better do it now!

380
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,820
Jamie, tell us, what are the things that they can vote on that they'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

381
00:26:52,820 --> 00:27:07,820
Playing 2DX, shaving a monkey, fixing Ryan's stupid fucking PS2, winning the lottery, working at Gamestop at Arden Fair Mall, napping, buying more Propel and drinking it, getting laid, getting fucked up the ass,

382
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:11,820
Yes, and naming ponies on Derby Owners Club.

383
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,820
I don't think I have it.

384
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,820
You should do because I gave it to you.

385
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,820
Okay, what?

386
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,820
What's on here?

387
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,820
I don't know.

388
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,820
I don't remember.

389
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:48,820
I'll look for dynamite, but it's probably on one of your pre-show discs, huh?

390
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,820
No, I actually gave it to you.

391
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,820
I gotta find it.

392
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,820
I don't know if I copied it to my drive.

393
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,820
It is an old pre-show.

394
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,820
Last week's pre-show.

395
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:09,100
Put this in and we'll find a song to play for you lovely people.

396
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,740
So we're going to play Big Black Cock.

397
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:19,260
Loading, loading, loading, loading away.

398
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,900
Did my Winamp freeze?

399
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,900
That would really suck.

400
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,900
No it didn't, good.

401
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,900
Okay.

402
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,900
Okay, what do we hear?

403
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,900
So what do we hear?

404
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,900
Uhhhhhhhhhhh.

405
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,960
Bitch this is cool but it's not crappy.

406
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,500
I didn't put any crappy shit on here.

407
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,360
How about this Upside Down remix?

408
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,320
That's the Eurobeat version of Upside Down.

409
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,320
That would be pretty gay.

410
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,320
We'll hear that.

411
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,320
Alright.

412
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,980
Alright, we'll be right back to reveal the top list of things we'd rather be doing than

413
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,980
watching the Super Bowl.

414
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,980
Here we go!

415
00:28:45,980 --> 00:29:08,860
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh oohOWOWOWOOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW metres

416
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:13,860
upside down, it's falling to the ground

417
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,860
you can let go of it, you can let the things in

418
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,860
upside down, now you're running all around

419
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,860
look who are you dancing, look who are you feeling

420
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,860
you look together, broken up your fever

421
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,860
so you're never feeling good

422
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,860
focus, let it be me, hear the people singing

423
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,860
everybody take your hand

424
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:42,860
I'm rowing on the ceiling, rowing by your feelings, rowing on the ceiling again

425
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,860
Move your boots and don't makeover, keep your feet a lover,

426
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,860
Why don't you stop from juicing your head?

427
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,860
Ooh, I wanna see you, but it could seem a sin

428
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

429
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:31,860
He knew that his heart was healing, if it hurts enough, he could try again.

430
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,860
But when she caught his eye, ain't no man could fight the feeling.

431
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:42,860
He knew he had to try to let love in, not to let her know, she was in the mood for talking.

432
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:49,860
So when he began to play the game, before he knew it he had told her how much he'd been hurting.

433
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,220
How he was hoping she was not the same

434
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,340
Could you see the kind of way we're gonna make it?

435
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,620
After all of this time, could it be true love?

436
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:03,540
And she says, boy, you don't have to love no more

437
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:07,700
I'll give the love you need till you holler in love, guaranteed

438
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,820
I like the look, boy, I'm a tight lady

439
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,860
You've been hurt, but be sure why I am the cure

440
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:17,620
And when you wake up late thinking it's a dream

441
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,620
Just don't stay for you, no, you can tell on me, believe me

442
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,620
Baby, that little lady, you know what she found in me

443
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,620
Is a lady, that kind of lady, that can give you what you need

444
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,620
Baby, that kind of lady, that can never leave you lonely

445
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:36,620
Is a lady, that kind of lady, finally got me all right, baby

446
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:50,620
I've been waiting them all Late at night when you're all alone

447
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:55,620
Hard to take, pick up the phone But here belongs to someone else

448
00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:00,620
You want to keep this love all for yourself You think you're being laid to sleep and die

449
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:07,620
Standing in love is so hard to find Gotta keep an eye on myself, don't wanna share it with anybody else

450
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:17,620
No one knows what goes on when we are all alone I know what I feel is so surreal

451
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:22,620
We are sacred lovers Hope no one lets go inside

452
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:26,620
See your everyday secret hideaway just around the way

453
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,620
If you love us, then make us

454
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,620
No one else I see, I will never see

455
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,620
What we have to bring

456
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,620
A secret rendezvous

457
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,620
I love you, love

458
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,620
You're the hand of the man

459
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,620
Baby, I want you to know I need you

460
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,620
Don't you know I need you here

461
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,620
And I know

462
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,620
You can whip my baby

463
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,620
You can don't send me in

464
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,620
The only way we can

465
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,620
Is a fantasy

466
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,620
Only you will need

467
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:25,540
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

468
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:29,540
Because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

469
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,540
They make it chocolate coated and it's yummy.

470
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,540
Get in here!

471
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,540
Jacking my hot spicy.

472
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,540
No. Jackie, my hot spicy boner, was taken off the list. I'm sorry.

473
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,540
Winning the lottery.

474
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,540
Winning the lottery was your number three pick.

475
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,540
Did you win yet?

476
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,540
I won a ticket.

477
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,540
Alright.

478
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:28,540
Your number two pick for things you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl is...

479
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,540
Buying more Propel and drinking it.

480
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,540
Yay! Buying more Propel and drinking it.

481
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,540
And in honor of Propel.

482
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,540
Alright.

483
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:50,540
And the number one thing y'all would rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl is playing 2DX.

484
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:57,540
So there you have it. I'm really disappointed that getting fucked up the ass and getting laid and all the sexual stuff was lose.

485
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,540
I'm starting to think your audience is a bunch of fucking weirdos.

486
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:06,540
If they think that winning the lottery is not as good as these other things.

487
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,540
Okay, if you win the lottery you can buy sex.

488
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,540
Winning lottery should be up there at the top.

489
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:15,540
Yeah, but after winning the lottery, you can buy Propel and drink it, too.

490
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,540
You can buy, like, vast amounts of Propel.

491
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,540
If you won the lottery, you could get all of those things.

492
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,540
And my spicy boner.

493
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,540
And you could buy it to the X machine.

494
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,540
Whoo! Or lots of tokens.

495
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,540
You could probably buy Scandi.

496
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,540
There you go, buy Scandi.

497
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,540
Don't worry, Keith, if we buy Scandi, we'll still keep your top.

498
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,540
Yeah, you can stay employed at Scandi.

499
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,540
Anyway, actually what I think we should do is buy Golf Land,

500
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:42,540
Fire all the management, and then turn it into a strip club.

501
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,540
Yee-haw!

502
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,540
Yeah!

503
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,540
No, we turned half of it into a strip club and the other half into a better arcade.

504
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,540
Yeah, where they would have upskirt DDR.

505
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,540
Upskirt DDR. Upskirt DDR.

506
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:59,540
I like the idea of an all-nude water park. Let's just turn Golf Land into a nudist colony.

507
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,540
Wait! Nudist colony with one little thing.

508
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:07,540
and it's got to be no, like they have, you know, welcomes all sorts of life, da da da da da, star.

509
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:16,540
No ugly people! This includes you, fat people, and you over 40 people, and you that apply to both of those.

510
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:21,540
No ugly people allowed. Period.

511
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:26,540
They have a pre-screening for this? You have to, like, pass the test.

512
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,540
Yes, and Jamie and I are the pre-screeners.

513
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:41,540
Here's the thing, it's going to have a few tests. First, it's going to be a slightly small doorway. If you can't fit through the doorway, you're not allowed to go in there first off.

514
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:49,540
Number two, it's going to have maybe some sort of small animal, like a monkey or something. You scare the monkey, you don't come in.

515
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:56,120
No, no, I'll just bring Shermy.

516
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,080
If Shermy doesn't like you, leave.

517
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,080
Exactly.

518
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:04,300
If she doesn't roll over and show you her belly, then you suck.

519
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:08,760
If she doesn't wave her genitalia at you, then there's something wrong.

520
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,720
No smelly people either, because there's some smelly people that go to golf land to play

521
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,560
guitar freaks.

522
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,800
One of them better be listening right now, because I'm going to tell you right now, fucking

523
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
wash your ass.

524
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,080
No sweaty balls and no unwashed twat.

525
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,080
Shwetty balls.

526
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,080
Shwetty balls.

527
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,080
Unwashed twat.

528
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
Hey, Ryan.

529
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,080
Come talk to us about your unwashed twat.

530
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,960
Do you have an unwashed twat, Ryan?

531
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,360
Has feminine odor and itching got you down?

532
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,520
Are you feeling not so fresh?

533
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,520
Try Vagisil.

534
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,320
Why don't you check on Vagiclean?

535
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,360
It's so hard when you just walk into a room and you're getting...

536
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,360
Not hard!

537
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,360
Not hard!

538
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,360
I hate you all.

539
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,360
I hate you all.

540
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,360
We love you.

541
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,360
Meatballs and douche, yes.

542
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,360
Meatballs and douche.

543
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,360
Now, wait a minute.

544
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,360
Now, hold on, hold on.

545
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,360
Hold up for a minute here.

546
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,360
Mabel's in the chat room and he's crying because he's claiming that he's fat and ugly and if

547
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,360
he was over 40 he wouldn't be able to get in.

548
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,360
You are neither.

549
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
No, you're not fat or ugly.

550
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,360
You can come to our nudist colonies.

551
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
All right.

552
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:11,360
Maples in the chat room and he's crying because he's claiming that he's fat and ugly and if he was over 40 he wouldn't be able to get in.

553
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,360
You were neither!

554
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,360
No, you're not fat or ugly, you can come to our nudist colony, so quit whining.

555
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,360
Wait, there's a second rule to this. It's called the pimp factor, okay?

556
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:29,360
You can look like whatever you want, but as long as you bring like at least fine, really fine honeys in, you're okay.

557
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:37,360
We need to have a room with really, really pretty men going at it so I can watch them.

558
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,360
Wait a minute though, no one under 18? Sorry.

559
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,360
No one under 18.

560
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,360
Yeah, sorry, we just can't have that. Sorry guys.

561
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,360
But I need the happy room.

562
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,360
We do like all our under 18 fans because we know we have a lot of under 18 people listening to what we're talking about.

563
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,360
We can't get in trouble, sorry guys.

564
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,360
I want the happy room though. I have to have the happy room.

565
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,360
They just have to tell us.

566
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,360
And then I can videotape it and sell it.

567
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:04,360
It could be like Beavis and Butthead. You must be over 18 to be able to shoot Skeet. Are you guys over 18?

568
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:12,360
Uh, no. Are you guys over 18? Yes. Okay, you can just... see, there you go.

569
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,360
Okay, okay, that'll work. That'll work. That's fine.

570
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:22,360
If you say you're under 18, you can't get in, but if you say you're over 18, then, you know, hey, we were only going off what you said, so...

571
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,660
I want the happy room.

572
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:31,920
You know, we could actually just turn it into a porn studio and then we would like pay for

573
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,920
everything that way.

574
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,920
Because porn is really cheap to make.

575
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:41,160
All you need is a video camera and like one of those handheld spotlights.

576
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:46,680
You don't even need a script to say, hey you, fuck, and then make something up.

577
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,380
Speaking of pornography, thank you for that lovely transition.

578
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,380
How was your week?

579
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,380
What is your week looking?

580
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,380
How is your week looking?

581
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,380
Frustrating. Very frustrating.

582
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,380
Why is that, your girlfriend out of town or something?

583
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,380
No.

584
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,380
She's not pregnant, is she?

585
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,380
No, she's not pregnant.

586
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,380
My girlfriend's okay.

587
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,380
I'm frustrated because of my computer.

588
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,380
It was out of commission for most of this week.

589
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,380
Which also explains why my website is still not up yet.

590
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,380
Dope.

591
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:26,780
No, I was trying to, yet again, trying to crack the DDR Extreme disc, so in which case,

592
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:33,500
I was, you know, I thought for some reason, actually, I figured out where everything is

593
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:39,460
on the disc, and, what the fuck is so funny?

594
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,460
It's not you, sorry.

595
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,460
I just showed Jamie something I talked to somebody.

596
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,460
Who is touching Jamie in there?

597
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,380
Stop it!

598
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,460
I was having a laugh at somebody's expense.

599
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,900
No, no, we'll tell you guys during the video.

600
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,020
So anyways, I was...

601
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,080
This is very distracting, you guys.

602
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,200
Sorry.

603
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,800
So, I was trying to install Linux on my computer.

604
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,760
I borrowed a couple copies of Linux from our friend Keith,

605
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,500
and I was installing them on my computer.

606
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,540
Well, you know, the damn thing didn't want to install for some reason. The installation program

607
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:17,260
thought it knew how to partition my drives better than I did, and so it was a pain in

608
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:21,780
the ass for about three days, and then finally I went out and bought Linux and saw that everything's

609
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:27,540
fine, but now I can't do what I wanted it to do in the first place, which was, um, I've

610
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:32,460
got, okay, basically here's the situation. I've got on the arcade disk for DDR Extreme,

611
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:36,860
there's a bunch of files on there. Now, they're images of actual, um, of the flashcards that

612
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:41,100
it flashes. So basically it copies this image to the flashcard, but in the images themselves

613
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:45,420
are actually file trees, you know, with a bunch of different folders and files with

614
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:50,260
them. And they're all Linux based. So what I was hoping to do is take, you know, Linux,

615
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:55,140
be able to open these image files and view the individual files themselves. Because I

616
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:59,500
know where all the data files are, I know where all the graphics files are, all the

617
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:04,900
freaking movie files, everything. I just don't know how to open them. That's it. So that

618
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:10,540
was my week. Exciting. No, it's not. You're right, it's not. Anyway.

619
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:20,780
My week was pretty good. I napped a lot, and I went out and did stuff. But last night was

620
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:25,760
entertaining. We were over here at my house, and one of the other hobbies that I participate

621
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,160
in is I'm in the local Rocky Horror Picture Show cast. So, speaking of which, if any of

622
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,320
you guys are in Orange Lounge World Headquarters in Sacramento, California, come on down to

623
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,400
the Metro on February 8th, because we're doing the Rocky Horror Picture Show. That's downtown

624
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,440
on K Street Vivids. Visit furtherindignities.com for more information.

625
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,960
I volunteered to be a prop. I volunteered to be a prop.

626
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:54,720
Yes, and Jamie's on the cast too, so we were here participating in the Rocky Horror rehearsal

627
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:01,520
last night, and somebody brought to cast rehearsal for Irene some pornography, some fine pornography,

628
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:09,240
And there was this porno called Ally McFeel, and Irene was a dumb bitch, of course, and

629
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:21,040
left it here.

630
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,120
So what happened last night, we were bored, and we went out to dinner.

631
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:29,120
We went out to the Lions, and after we came back from Lions, Jamie and I were bored, so

632
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:33,080
We decided we'd watch this porno, Ally McBeal, and it's great.

633
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,080
It's fucking great.

634
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:38,040
We wanted to play a clip from it for you guys, because basically the way it is, it's set

635
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,040
up.

636
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,040
How did it start?

637
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:44,540
It starts with this woman, and she's masturbating with a huge dildo, and the dildo explodes

638
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:48,160
inside her, basically, in her cavernous pussy.

639
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,840
She has this huge pussy, it's huge, and the dildo explodes, so she decides she's going

640
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:57,200
to sue the toy company, and basically, just like on the real show, Ally McBeal, when they

641
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,320
they go to the law firm, all the lawyers and everybody, they're all fucking each other

642
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,640
basically.

643
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,520
So then we have the big trial, the big trial comes later, and we wanted to play a clip

644
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,280
from the trial for you guys.

645
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,680
We have Johnny Cochran, who is...

646
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,680
I have to giggle.

647
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,120
Yeah, she gave him her panties at the beginning of the video.

648
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,640
Yes, we have Johnny Cochran, and Ally McPheil gave Johnny Cochran her panties.

649
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,040
He sniffed them and put them in his jacket.

650
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,240
Yeah, and he sniffed them and put them in his jacket, and he's basically the lawyer

651
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,520
supporting the woman who had the dildo explode inside of her.

652
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,520
The Australian woman.

653
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,920
Yes, and Ally McFeel, her client is the company that made the exploding dildo.

654
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,280
Who, by the way, fucks the other person in the room.

655
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,120
Yeah, who, by the way, fucks the chick with the cavernous pussy in the beginning.

656
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,120
She knows how to use the dildo.

657
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,520
But anyway, yeah, to see if she really knows how to use the dildo, you know, kind of an

658
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,520
instruction manual.

659
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,080
So, anyway, we're going to play a clip from this fabulous porno, which, by the way, also

660
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,240
guest stars Ron Jeremy.

661
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,240
That was cool.

662
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,240
That was humongous.

663
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:03,040
real porno with Ron Jeremy in it I'm sorry but yeah what that was like yeah

664

668
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,160
What is big?

669
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,160
12 inches or more.

670
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,160
Holy shit, I'm in. Ow.

671
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,160
Okay, but you have to wear a mask and shave your body hair.

672
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:43,160
Here we go. Here's a clip from Ally McFeel here on Orange Lounge Radio.

673
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:50,160
And if you like Ally McFeel, since I don't want to get sued by the people who made this, go out and buy it right now.

674
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,080
it's uh... it's a wonderful porno two thumbs up way up

675
00:45:54,080 --> 00:46:01,080

676
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,520
though it's not coming through a hold on just one moment we have uh... an issue

677
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,240
hold on one second

678
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,920

679
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,840
tell

680
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,360
let's try this again

681
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:23,360
This offending instrument was manufactured by Mr. Boner's company.

682
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,360
Objection! My client's name is Boner.

683
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:32,360
As in Christ, I'd like to bone her a tight little asshole with my big black cock.

684
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,360
Ms. Macphiel, you're walking a tight line here.

685
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:41,360
Counsel will not refer to defendant as Boner.

686
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:47,360
Mr. Boner's company may as well manufacture this defective dildo.

687
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,960
It apparently damages my clients genitalia.

688
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,960
Emotional physical harm has set in.

689
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,960
Chicken...

690
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,960
...tokus pokus...

691
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,960
...is yes.

692
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,960
Judge, I ask you.

693
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,960
Do the right thing.

694
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,960
If the dildos is not fit...

695
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,960
...then they are not legit.

696
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,960
Big black cock.

697
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,960
We were just really excited

698
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,960
and Jamie and I started wetting our pants

699
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,960
when she said big black cock.

700
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:20,960
The little gear started turning in Rob's head as he thought, how am I going to pass it?

701
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,960
Dude, that's it! Dude, I got the G!

702
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,960
What is that bullshit?

703
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,960
Maple missed it, so we have to play it again. Sorry, guys. Here we go.

704
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,960
Hold on one more time. Instant replay.

705
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:34,960
What class did it tell you?

706
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,960
Oops, sorry. Let me get back here.

707
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,960
La la la la la la la.

708
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,960
It should be part of a new promo.

709
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:44,960
This offending instrument was manufactured by Mr. Boner's company.

710
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,960
Attention! My client's name is Bonher.

711
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,960
As in Christ, I'd like to bone her tight little asshole with my big black cock.

712
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,960
I'm just a big dick, you know, made up for it all.

713
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,960
You sit there with this blank look on your face.

714
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,960
Well, I haven't seen it. I just saw the few scenes.

715
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,960
Yeah, you missed the big three-way lesbian scene, too.

716
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,960
I was previewing Ally McField.

717
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:38,960
I got one, though. It has, like, 50 black Nubian nurses and a giant gangbang.

718
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,960
Does that count?

719
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:40,960
What's a Nubian?

720
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,960
Nubian is a shit.

721
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,960
It's a joke. It's a joke from Chasing Gaming. Never mind.

722
00:48:44,960 --> 00:49:01,240
I thought that scene was funny, though, the one chick gets her teeth knocked out and he's

723
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:05,720
all, ooh, a gummer, and then later on she gets her teeth back again, like, ooh, what

724
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,200
happened there?

725
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,900
This porno gets Orange Lounge's highest recommendation, by the way.

726
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:11,900
Two dicks up.

727
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:12,900
Way up.

728
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:13,900
I want to see that other one.

729
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:18,580
other porno we'll watch that a little later okay okay anyway so yeah oh yeah

00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:40,940
about going to Scotland and the kilt cam military kilt cam there's nothing as

734
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:46,900
as enjoyable as kilts worn the traditional way on a breezy day.

735
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,900
You're a pervert.

736
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:51,820
You know, that's really gotten me wondering about a lot of my town's folk.

737
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:55,700
I got, you know, Bob the Cat, and he's wearing like a skirt throughout my town.

738
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,260
I'm like, what the fuck's going on?

739
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,260
Ooh!

740
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,260
That's hot.

741
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,260
Bob, you're a guy.

742
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:03,180
You're supposed to be wearing guy clothes, not a skirt.

743
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:08,220
There's this rhino in our town named Spike who has a band-aid on his face and he's all

744
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,220
hardcore.

745
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:16,420
a skull shirt and then one day he started wearing a blue moo moo with daisies on it.

746
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,380
Your town makes people gay, remember?

747
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:23,100
Yes, my town makes animals and the big ol' gays.

748
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,660
My town is the gay!

749
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:30,100
Well, you know there was the triangle with Dina and Goldie and then Goldie left her for

750
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,100
Bobra.

751
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,100
Oh my.

752
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:38,740
Well, no, because we thought that Goldie was getting the twat action from Dina, you know,

753
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,740
You know, because Dina has that big, long bill.

754
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,740
And then, because she was saying sugar bill, like Dina says.

755
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:48,740
And then, all of a sudden, she starts saying, I suck, like Barbara says, because we hate Barbara, and she says, I suck.

756
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:49,740
Scandalous, scandalous.

757
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:54,740
I think I'm just going to change what horns be when my town says no to my master again.

758
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:58,740
I have one in my town, Cody. He says, you ass, after everything.

759
00:50:58,740 --> 00:50:59,740
So he goes, what's going on, you ass?

760
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:03,740
I've got my, I've got, what was it, Ricky the squirrel or whatever.

761
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,740
Oh, that little asshole that moved from my village.

762
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:09,740
I changed his thing to say skanky hoe after everything he says.

763
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:13,740
My girlfriend loves it.

764
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:17,740
Does she enjoy my letter?

765
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:21,740
She's like, why do you send me stuff?

766
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:25,740
All the townsfolk don't understand anything I write them.

767
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:29,740
I'm going to give you a big tip on Animal Crossing, everybody.

768
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:33,740
If you want to get things from the villagers, write a full letter.

769
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,740
six lines of letter to your villagers.

770
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:37,740
All I do is,

771
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,740
Dear so-and-so,

772
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,740
You suck. I want you to die and go to hell.

773
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,740
I hate your guts and I wish that you never moved to my village.

774
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,740
Love, Sakura.

775
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,740
And I get stuff from them.

776
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:49,740
See, I wrote one to Cody that said,

777
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,740
All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.

778
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,740
All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.

779
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,740
All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.

780
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,740
And he sent me furniture.

781
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,740
That's great!

782
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,740
I got a letter from Goose today,

783
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:05,740
I was about to say Shaky Trees and a furniture fell on my head.

784
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:08,740
That was it. I was like, why are you sending me shit?

785
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,740
I don't even want to talk to you, you dumb bitch.

786
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:13,740
I like when they're giving you a tip, do you know how to catch fish yet?

787
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:18,740
Well, I just gave you a fish, you jackass. Where do you think I got it from?

788
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:22,740
You want to be slapped in the head by a wet trout. By the way, we can just slap somebody in the head.

789
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,740
You want to slap people in the chatroom with wet trout? Okay, go for it.

790
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:29,740
Well, you've got to click on their name first. Then you slap them. There you go.

791
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:33,740
You just slapped 23rd Magus with a large trout. How was that?

792
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,740
I'm going to slap somebody else.

793
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,740
You're going to slap somebody else?

794
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:41,740
All right!

795
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,740
Why are you slapping myself?

796
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:49,740
So, Jamie's having fun slapping people with trout.

797
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:53,740
I'm sorry, hold on.

798
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:57,740
Yeah, Ryan pointed out something. It says in God we trust in the thing, but it should say in God we thrust.

799
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:03,920
thrust. Hey, you know what? There's scenes in here that never happened. These are just

800
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,920
like promo pictures.

801
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,280
Well, actually, I wanted to give out the website address if you guys want to order Ally McField

802
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,760
because I really don't want to get sued by these people for playing a clip from their

803
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:17,440
thing. It's passionpictures.com or you can visit hollywoodpornstars.com.

804
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:24,960
Yeah, you don't want to get sued by this company yet you blatantly have. Oh, wait. Never mind.

805
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:31,960
My mistake, we buy all those soundtracks.

806
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:37,680
So Jamie's having fun slapping people in the chatroom with, uh, trouts.

807
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:44,680
Good. Oh, I saw something funny on, uh, Saturday. Okay, so I was outside after playing a vigorous

808
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,980
game of DDR Extreme and I was tired, you know, airing out my shoes and whatnot, and I'm watching

809
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:56,200
in the batting cages. And stupid kid number one, and I love it when stupid people get

810
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:00,380
punished, stupid kid number one decides, I'm going to go bat in the batting cage. And his

811
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:04,480
little father, his father, there's no watching him and stuff. Well stupid fat chubby kid

812
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:09,540
number one decides to try to hit the ball. Misses the ball, and so it hits the back little

813
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:13,540
thing there. So stupid kid number one goes, dude, I'm going to pick up the ball and hit

814
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:18,260
it. So he picks up the ball, stands back up, THWAP, in the back of his head with a 50 mile

815
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:23,260
now her softball, and the stupid kid falls on the ground. I started busting out.

816
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:28,260
We didn't look at the pictures on this board.

817
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,260

00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:10,240
uh... and then we come back we'll do uh... this week's cage match houses

834
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,680
all right

835
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,160
yes we would play looking something from here

836
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,160
I don't know, this stuff is, um...

837
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,160
Are you going to do FUs of the Week when we come back, or are you going to do, uh...

838
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,160
Alright, never mind, I'll take that back. Instead of the cage match, we're going to do FUs of the Week.

839
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:27,160
So send me your FUs of the Week over private message or over email to orangeloungeradio.yahoo.com

840
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,160
Okay.

841
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,160
Woo.

842
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,160
Yeah.

843
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:35,160
Um, well, let's see, what we're going to be playing on the break here is going to be two remix songs from, um, Club Mix.

844
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:40,160
Actually, we've got Jam Jam Reggae, and we also have, um...

845
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,160
Ska Go Go, right?

846
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,160
Ska Go Go, yes.

847
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,160
Cool.

848
00:55:43,160 --> 00:56:01,160
The first one is Jam Jam Reggae, the Jam Jam Mix remix by Good Cool, and the second one is actually remixed by the same group, or it's actually arranged by Ken Matsu somehow, I don't know, name gets cut off there, but anyways, it's cool, so, well let's see here.

849
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,160
Matsu-Moto!

850
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:12,160
Matsu-Moto, so it's the Bald Heads remix by Ken Matsu-Moto, or whatever, and it's Scott Gogo, Get the Funk Out mix, so, enjoy.

851
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,160
And war is breaking out in the chat room right now. I better go stop it.

852
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:57,160
Are you ready for the game?

853
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:00,160
Here we go!

854
00:58:30,160 --> 00:59:00,040
Uh, hi, we don't want dead air so I'm gonna find something to throw on real fast here.

855
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:05,040
Let's do something booty from SoloMix. That'll be fun.

856
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:09,040
Actually, no, I don't wanna do that one. I wanna do, uh...

857
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,040
I told you this one.

858
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,040
Here we go again, turn it up my friends, no

859
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:45,040
We don't stop, we rock the spot, no

860
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,540
We don't quit, kick failure, this is it

861
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:50,540
Do you like a dream, hey, I like a dream baby

862
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:53,540
Do you like a dream, oh, I like a dream mama

863
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:56,540
Do you like a scream, hey, I like a scream baby

864
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:59,540
Do you like a scream, oh, scream it out

865
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:02,540
Scream a dream, love a epic industry

866
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:05,540
If there's any real thing for you making me scream

867
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:42,540
Listen to Orange Jog's radio, where you can witness Rob be kicked off the ass by Brad.

868
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:48,540
Brad did a good job. All that Rob's asshole is quite large by now, like a mason jar.

869
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:54,540
You could hold strawberry preserves to Rob's rectum now, and have it tightly sealed.

870
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:59,540
Yeah. Oh baby, I have the hugest...

871
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:04,540
I'm going to the kitchen and there's Rob's young Brad's ass.

872
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:08,540
Hey, it's not my fault all the boys and girls love me.

873
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:12,540
Who's Irene now?

874
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:16,540
Well, Irene was sitting on my lap. Ha ha ha!

875
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:20,540
Oh yes, shall we do the FUs of the week now?

876
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:24,540
Would that be like an extension cord?

877
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:28,540
Blink blink blink.

878
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:32,540
If you have an FU of the week you can send those over a private message or email.

879
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:34,540
I want Teramix today.

880
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:35,540
You want Teramix today?

881
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:36,540
Teramix.

882
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,540
Picky, picky, picky.

883
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:40,540
Picky, picky, picky.

884
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:41,540
Gross.

885
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:43,540
That was a chocolate bar.

886
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:44,540
Alright, let's have at it.

887
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:46,540
This burp was bought to you by Russell Stover Chocolate.

888
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:49,540
Beautiful.

889
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,540
Dude, you look like you're trying to deep throat this.

890
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:58,540
This is fucked up.

891
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:00,540
The first episode he goes to the soup bowl.

892
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:02,540
Yeah, I went to the soup bowl.

893
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:04,540
I think I caught a wreck of it.

894
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:06,540
I just gave it to them.

895
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:08,540
And they had their big, squeaky beak

896
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:10,540
going super over loud, and these guys

897
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:12,540
they're going, hooah!

898
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:14,540
The whole time.

899
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:16,540
This girl finally goes, hooah!

900
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:18,540
Listen to me!

901
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:20,540
I have a dick, hooah!

902
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,540
Like that.

903
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:24,540
So a sound clip for a future episode.

904
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,540
ahahaha

905
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:28,540
ahhhhh

906
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,540

907
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:32,540

01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,540

913
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:44,540

914
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:46,540
and to pat

915
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:48,540

916
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:50,540
wooooo

917
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:52,540
this is jpmr

918
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:57,540
I'm sorry, I'm from the U.S.

919
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:05,540
And my other fuck you to me goes toward America for being stupid.

920
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:15,540
Okay, what about American football has to do with using your feet, but kicking the ball, it happens like for what, one occurrence in the whole game?

921
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:19,540
The whole having to run around and everything might have to be game to beat.

922
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:26,540
You don't kick the ball. That's why soccer should be football. Like it is everywhere else in the god damn world.

923
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,540
I mean, it's not football.

924
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:30,540
No, no, no, no, no, no. It's a brand thing.

925
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:31,540
Brand thing.

926
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:33,540
It's not called kickball.

927
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:35,540
But here's the thing. Here's the thing though. I want to say.

928
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:36,540
That they use their feet.

929
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:39,540
The thing is that America doesn't give a shit about soccer.

930
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:40,540
Soccer is not...

931
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:41,540
Soccer is cool.

932
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:42,540
Soccer is not cool.

933
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:44,540
Soccer is not important in America.

934
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:51,220
And by the way, American football is a rip-off of rugby, which is a much cooler, violent,

935
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:52,220
bloodier sport.

936
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:53,220
Because you know what?

937
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:56,900
There's something about, okay, first of all, there's the guys that play it.

938
01:03:56,900 --> 01:04:00,860
A lot of them are really nicely built, and don't look like they've been swallowing steroids

939
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:03,060
since they were two years old.

940
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:07,340
They don't have necks with the circumference of a watermelon.

941
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:08,340
Okay?

942
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:14,340
They look like normal guys, and they're muscular, and they have a nice butt.

943
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:17,340
And then they get all bloody, which is even better.

944
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:18,340
Because Jimmy's got a dick.

945
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:20,340
Roar!

946
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:32,340
Mabel would like to add that soccer is only cool if you're playing Virtua Striker at MGL with another friend.

947
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,340
Um, no.

948
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:41,340
Although, and you know, it was really awesome, they even made it into like, I don't know if there was a box or something

949
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:46,340
where they had things being made and all of a sudden they were talking about it all over the place.

950
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:54,340
Um, what else do you think is fucked? I don't know. What else do you think is fucked?

951
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:58,340
Not necessarily who needs to get fucked, but what needs to fuck you?

952
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:12,340
Oh yeah, fuck me not having a way to get to Hayward next weekend, because Dan doesn't want me to drive my car to Hayward, because I just got it.

953
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:21,340
I would also like to say that my CD player for the CDI retracts my CD to a weekly note.

954
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:26,340
What was the one that I was going to listen to from your album?

955
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:29,340
No. Um, wealth land?

956
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:33,340
Um, I don't go there anymore.

957
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:36,340
Is your brain free?

958
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,340
I'm not the first person.

959
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:46,340
Um, I would like to, um, say thank you to my lack of, um, man sex.

960
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:47,340
Brain?

961
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:50,340
I don't have any man sex.

962
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:53,340
You were asking for my brain earlier.

963
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:55,340
And I need more doujinshi.

964
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:59,340
Yeah. People find me, they'll get me and send it to me, okay?

965
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:02,340
And, um...

966
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:04,340
Um, yeah.

967
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:06,340
Alright.

968
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:09,340
Matt, give us your FUs of the Week.

969
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,340
Um, please.

970
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:14,340
FU goes to Linux!

971
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:17,340
Fuck you Linux, you're a stupid installer!

972
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:20,340
Work right for once, goddammit! You're free!

973
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:22,340
You should be working!

974
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:29,340
I'll see here, I installed three versions of Linux this weekend, 7.1 decided G, I don't feel like I'm going to install at all,

975
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:35,340
because I'm going to tell you that your blank 20 gig hard drive has not enough space for me to install my stupid program.

976
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:45,340
So, then I tried installing Red Hat 7.0, got that working, and it's a Japanese copy! I can't read Japanese, so that's not going to do any good.

977
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:49,340
And then finally installed Mandrake 6.4

978
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:53,340
And, uh, well, you know what? That program's so old it doesn't run jack.

979
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:57,340
It doesn't understand what my monitor is, it doesn't even know what my video card is, so

980
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:00,340
it didn't do me any good, it's like installing Windows 3.0.

981
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:04,340
So finally I got Linux, uh, what was it, Mandrake 9, that works fine.

982
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:09,340
Except the fact that it's a stupid bootloader that puts it in there instead of the Windows bootloader.

983
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:14,340
It causes the program to make my Windows kinda glitch out a little bit every now and then.

984
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:18,740
So that sucks, because I have to reinstall windows and not own this, so...

985
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:23,140
Okay, um, other than that, F you too, the DMV.

986
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:30,140
Why the DMV? Because I can't attack the stupid drivers anymore because you're still stupid and nothing's gonna ever help you.

987
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:34,940
So I'm gonna yell at the DMV for letting you stupid drivers get on the road in the first place.

988
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:40,340
You're fucking stupid! Actually, you know, let people take the test and fail the test numerous times.

989
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:50,340
I hate you! You're stupid! Part of the government, which makes you worse, because the government

990
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:51,340
sucks.

991
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:52,340
Do I accept all that?

992
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:53,340
Go ahead.

993
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:56,340
Is it easy to let old people back through it?

994
01:07:56,340 --> 01:08:01,340
Yes. This also, you know, ends up being to old people.

995
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:09,340
You know what? I think after a certain age, you outlive your usefulness and you should

996
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:16,340
down

997
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,260
I hate to see now old people

998
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:21,860
they're stupid

999
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:23,060
I hate em

1000
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:25,940
uh... actually also an f-cube for uh...

1001
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:27,460
reality tv shows

1002
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:30,780
Hey! I love reality tv! Stop popping up like freaking

1003
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:32,380
I don't know what dammit

1004
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:33,900
it's like a fucking plague

1005
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:37,140
it's like I'm gonna turn on the t.v. Guess what we're gonna watch people

1006
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:40,740
keep themselves in the head guess what we're gonna watch brides get mad i agree you know

1007
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:45,360
what that bridezilla man vs beast all that shit completely useless but surreal life best

1008
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:51,700
show ever but that bridezilla thing is the reason why i want to upload okay um i did

1009
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:55,820
find it funny though that they had uh hundred mitch or like 50 mitch and pull a jet and

1010
01:08:55,820 --> 01:09:02,580
had i guess the elephant because mitch pulling anything is funny but yeah so you watched

1011
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:04,580
No, I saw the commercial.

1012
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:05,580
Oh.

1013
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:08,580
I watch the commercial!

1014
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:09,580
Yeah!

1015
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:16,580
Anyway, so, um, also another F.P. Decrouted arcade, because I don't like coin lines that are 16 coins long.

1016
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:25,580
One, no one can figure out what turn they're up, and also, um, I don't like waiting like 20 minutes between games, or half an hour or whatnot.

1017
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:30,580
So, yeah, pretty weak, but that's my F.P. Decrouted.

1018
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:40,580
Beautiful. My FU of the Week goes to Brad for making me late for that last segment so that Jamie could have her way with making fun of me.

1019
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:50,580
And I would like to also give an FU to the coin line. I've ranted about this weeks ago. Completely useless. It's useless these days.

1020
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:56,580
Back in the days with Street Fighter when everybody would like watch everybody else play and stuff, it kept places a little better.

1021
01:09:56,580 --> 01:10:02,100
better. When people use custom coins, I guess it kind of works, but the way it is now, it

1022
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:06,700
doesn't work. You need to sign up cheap. Fuck the coin line. I hate it. Stupid. I'm just

1023
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:13,700
going to cut in front of everybody. Until you get a better system, I play first. Ow.

1024
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,700
Oh! Hey, dammit!

1025
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:21,700
Alright, uh, my other F.U. goes to, uh, Beat Horny! Yes!

1026
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:26,700
Alright, that's all my F.U.s.

1027
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:30,700
Uh, let's go around the room and, alright, Jamie has one more.

1028
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:37,700
I have my other F.U. goes toward, um, not having a dual RX.

1029
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:38,700
This is fucked up.

1030
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:41,700
Because I want to play Strider and stuff like that. Thank you.

1031
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:47,700
Thank you for sharing that. Let's go around the room and hear our guest's FUs of the Week.

1032
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:49,700
What are you handing me the mic for?

1033
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:54,700
The only thing I gotta fuck you is, you know, as much as he's given the US lately,

1034
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:59,700
I'd like to put a fuck you out to Itagaki for completely lying to the US about DOA,

1035
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:04,700
extreme beach volleyball, and pushing back the next Virtua Cup for another year!

1036
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:06,700
Fuck you!

1037
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,700
FUs of the Week, Brad?

1038
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,700
My F.U. goes to drama, seriously.

1039
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,700
I can't find my song. It's me arm.

1040
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,700
And neck, neck.

1041
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:15,700
Shit. Oh well. I need some other time.

1042
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:17,700
Neck, neck, neck, neck.

1043
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,700
My love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love.

1044
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,700
Oh well. Oh well.

1045
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:24,700
Oh well. A hopeless quest.

1046
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:26,700
Alright, let's read the chatroom FUs, shall we?

1047
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:27,700
Whoo!

1048
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:33,700
One, two, three, four, fuck.

1049
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:35,700
Fuck being tired? Fuck algebra?

1050
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:37,700
Two, that is. Fuck algebra two.

1051
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,700
And fuck me for not being able to type.

1052
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:46,700
EOSFPB, fuck you to people with fuck yous. What do you have to be mad about? There's a new Matrix trailer.

1053
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:54,700
Wait, I take that back. Fuck you to all the sportsbooks here who paid the raiders to throw the game after overly hyping how much ass the raiders were gonna kick ass.

1054
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:56,700
The house always wins because it keeps things stupid.

1055
01:12:56,700 --> 01:13:04,700
What are you talking about there's nothing to be fucking mad about? The Matrix movie isn't hell yet, sew up the trailer. Is that the wait like three months for the movie?

1056
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,700
It's too long!

1057
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:13,700
Fuck the Daredevil movie. Ben Affleck will make a shitty Daredevil, and the chick they

1058
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:21,040
got to play Elektra looks nothing like her. But I'm going to see it anyway. And fuck me

1059
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,040
for wanting to see it.

1060
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:31,040
Um, uh, um. Yeah, I mean, come on, Elektra is Asian. Her character's Asian. The chicken

1061
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,640
alias is white. And not just white, it's trailer trash white.

1062
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,640
We needed to get Tia Carrere to play our game.

1063
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,640
Yeah, or Agent Carrere.

1064
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,640
Tia Carrere is the shit.

1065
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,640
She was on it.

1066
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:45,640
I was thinking...

1067
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,640
Means World is the shit. No, not Lucy Lu, man.

1068
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,640
Ugh, Lucy Lu sucks.

1069
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:53,640
How about the chick from, um, um, Gretchen Taker didn't drag.

1070
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:55,640
Oh, um, what?

1071
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,640
Oh yeah, yeah, the one that was in Rush Hour 2.

1072
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,640
She would have been fucking awesome because she taught and she kicked ass.

1073
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,640
She actually knows martial arts.

1074
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,640
The chick in Alias is just a fucking little wannabe bitch.

1075
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,640
I think we should have a later circuit, by the way, about Confucius.

1076
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:13,640
You know what some people like to point out? Even if the chick that plays Elektra doesn't look like her, Jennifer Garner gots ass.

1077
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,640
That ass could make J-Lo cry.

1078
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:18,640
I'm sorry, you're desperate because she is fucking ugly.

1079
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,640
Elektra is Asian.

1080
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,640
You are desperate.

1081
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:26,640
Blueheimer wanted to share the trailer trash white would be a cool new Crayola cover.

1082
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,040
hahahahaha

1083
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:31,280
actually i'd rather see uh... found

1084
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,880
as i heard

1085
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,320
killed very violently

1086
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:37,260
funny way

1087
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:40,060
funny death is always fun

1088
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:43,120
except you know where i am going i'm not going to wonder

1089
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,540
i'd like to have my uh... best friend from high school not literally

1090
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:50,780
but i'd like to send out an f you my best friend from high school because one day i was in a really shitty mood

1091
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:53,460
and he said i don't know how i'm going to cheer you up rob

1092
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:57,940
let's go to my house watch faces of death

1093
01:14:57,940 --> 01:15:01,840
so we started watching faces of death and i'm sorry

1094
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,420
you don't want to be already feeling sad

1095
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:06,420
it's hilarious what are you talking about?

1096
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:08,420
it's not hilarious, it's so hilarious

1097
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:12,780
i love that one of the guys, the guy with the station wagon that puts a rocket on the back

1098
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:17,980
and wings on it and flies over the river and explodes in the air, what a dumbass

1099
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:21,980
I saw some guy who was skydiving and it gets eaten by a crocodile. It was disgusting.

1100
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:22,980
It was cool.

1101
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,980
No, it was gross.

1102
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:29,980
Actually, you know what horror movie had funny deaths?

1103
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:31,980
It was all the Nightmare on Elm Street movies.

1104
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:32,980
Yeah, Nightmare on Elm Street movies were all funny.

1105
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:33,980
That was funny deaths.

1106
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:38,980
Movie funny deaths are cool because you always laugh and go, oh, how did they do that, you know,

1107
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:41,980
type thing, and oh, movie special effects are so funny.

1108
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:42,980
Like in the first...

1109
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:44,980
Like when Chick-Tick got turned into a cockroach.

1110
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:50,980
Or I'm thinking from the very first Final Destination, that chick that gets hit by the bus, I laughed so fucking hard. Anyway.

1111
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:56,980
Alright, moving on. Back to the chatroom, here we go.

1112
01:15:58,980 --> 01:15:59,980
Whack-whap!

1113
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:02,980
Uh, fuck you to Chat Cookie.

1114
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:09,980
Fuck the Raiders, they suck. Fuck the UC Davis IT people for taking two weeks to fix the connection in the dorm.

1115
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:12,980
Fuck the fact that I still haven't played 2DX Escandia yet.

1116
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:17,980
Fuck the fact that no one responded to my post in comp sci class news group asking for a program partner.

1117
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:20,980
I need a partner so I can finish my next program by Wednesday.

1118
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:24,980
And fuck sexual frustration, especially at 18 and away at college and a virgin.

1119
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:25,980
Aw.

1120
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:26,980
You poor baby.

1121
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:29,980
Sorry, Loki. That's information you don't want to give out on the air.

1122
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:32,980
Dude, that's like being hungry in a fast food joint.

1123
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:34,980
Yeah, exactly.

1124
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:38,980
If you can't order from the menu, there's something wrong there.

1125
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:44,980
Hey, you know what, black guy, if you want to get laid, but see the thing is he has a girlfriend.

1126
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:47,980
He saves himself. They're in love and all this stuff, you know.

1127
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:53,980
So, we can't exactly just go take him to a bar, get him drunk, and get the little chick drunk and say, okay, here's the bed.

1128
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:58,980
I've heard this story before, too. Let's see, I think the beginning of Road Trip, it had something very similar.

1129
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:04,980
They're in love, you know, they're away at college, and I believe, what was it?

1130
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:06,980
Oh, I forget his name, but anyway, he's just like,

1131
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:08,980
Your penis can never forgive you.

1132
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:10,980
Hahahahaha!

1133
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:12,980
Give me five days of opportunity!

1134
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:14,980
I'm gonna pack up my balls and leave!

1135
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:20,980
Okay, there's plenty of pussy wanting to be a pussy there, I call it. Take it there.

1136
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:26,980
If you want to get laid, we will get you laid, it just won't be your girlfriend, sorry.

1137
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:32,980
I'm sure she's a nice lady, but if she ain't gonna open the legs, you ain't gonna get in, so...

1138
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:37,140
in defense

1139
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:40,900
yes

1140
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:43,580
overruled

1141
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:46,820
objection

1142
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:49,660
i think

1143
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:52,020
you think that is admirable

1144
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:52,900
no

1145
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:55,380
this is the thing though

1146
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:58,740
not going to because you're not you're not me

1147
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:01,100
and here's what i think

1148
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:05,900
I'm sure she's a wonderful girl. All the girls I dated in high school were saving themselves

1149
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:10,960
for marriage, too. And I'd like to point out, I turned out gay. So be careful. Don't make

1150
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,500
Ryan gay. He won't like it.

1151
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:18,620
You know, this might have been popular back in the 90s. 1890s? Not today. This is a cloak.

1152
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:21,900
Get with the times here. People don't do that shit no more. And when they do, they're lying.

1153
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:23,100
Look, look at, like this.

1154
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:29,800
For the record, for the record. Okay. I said that I was going to save myself for the one

1155
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:34,800
person who I was going to spend the rest of my life with, and I did, because I'm going

1156
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:41,800
to marry Anne, and so there are people with morals in this world, thank you, even though

1157
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,800
I'm currently...

1158
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,800
Screw morals, orders of G.H.B. online, that'll get you laid real quick.

1159
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,800
Although I'm currently living in this area.

1160
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:54,800
This is what it boils down to. You don't have to put out for the horny 18-year-old. Listen

1161
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:59,480
lady when you're 35 and you're at your sexual peak and no guy's gonna have sex

1162
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:05,360
with you don't come whining to us

1163
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:13,200
you may think that but no that ain't gonna happen then by then by then it's

1164
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:16,520

1165
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:22,360

1166
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:25,200
go my car with the fuck trying to drink it

1167
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:28,360
they have said the worry twenty years ago with the help

1168
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,560
now you like it now

1169
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,280
with world down there

1170
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:37,280
shoes on the other hand now is it

1171
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:41,280
and

1172
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:45,080
i don't even know the meaning of the word

1173
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:48,080
yes okay i'm going to take care of that

1174
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:52,080
word to plural before you, thanks to dicksmary.com.

1175
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:55,480
Okay, you know what, Black Lab's F.U. has just stopped the F.U.'s of the week segment

1176
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:58,320
while we look this stuff up. We'll resume it in a minute.

1177
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:08,320
D.L.O.R.A.B.L. Let's see. Get top ten most popular ones.

1178
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:20,320
condemnation or reproach. Lamentable, woeful, wretched, bad. As in, damn you suck! Deplorable!

1179
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:26,320
That was the fourth definition there, I think. Yeah, the dictionary according to Jamie.

1180
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:31,320
Alright, are we ready to resume the FUs of the week? Can you guys all stop talking about sex now?

1181
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:34,320
Yeah.

1182
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,320
You got that?

1183
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,320
Yeah.

1184
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:41,320
Dick is in, go choke on life.

1185
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:42,320
Ahh!

1186
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:43,320
Ahh!

1187
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:45,320
Brad's giving me head, live on air.

1188
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:46,320
Alright.

1189
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,320
That's a good radio.

1190
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:48,320
I thought our radio could go up.

1191
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,320
I hate radio.

1192
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,320
That's what we need to do.

1193
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:54,280
Now we've done drunk, then we need to have the sex show, where we have people get laid

1194
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:55,280
live on air.

1195
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,280
I won't be here for that.

1196
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,280
I'll be at home.

1197
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:00,320
And then we'll have the violence show, where we kill something.

1198
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:04,320
Where I take a sledgehammer and go chasing after a bunny.

1199
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:09,320
No, bunnies, don't kill bunnies. Bunnies are cute.

1200
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:12,320
You guys are the name of oolong.

1201
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,320
You guys are me.

1202
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,320
You guys are so cute.

1203
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,320
It's a target.

1204
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,320
No!

1205
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,320
You guys are awful.

1206
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:25,320
Rob, I like bunnies too.

1207
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:26,320
For dinner.

1208
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,320
You guys are awful.

1209
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,320
Rob's going to get a bunny.

1210
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,320
I want to get a bunny.

1211
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:34,320
It's going to poop little round things all over your house.

1212
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,320
I only eat the cute animals.

1213
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,320
You can potty train your bunny.

1214
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,320
I'm an adder!

1215
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,320
Can we get back to the shower refuse please?

1216
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,320
Okay, you don't have to get under here. What are you?

1217
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,320
I'm a cow. Get on the train!

1218
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,320
Dennis Leary.

1219
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,320
Moving on.

1220
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,320
Just bring out a whole cow.

1221
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:56,320
I'll call Brock what I want and ride the rest home.

1222
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,320
Okay, this is me.

1223
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:05,320
3F-2T-2T-2T-2T-2T-2T-2T-2T

1224
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:36,320
nephew to himself with big black cocks, nephew to everyone who doesn't like his so-called freestyle double routine to the whistle song, complete with pelvic thrusts on freezes.

1225
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:41,320
Exactly, whatever, why don't you go cry me a river and blow me a rap?

1226
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,320
Get over it, guys.

1227
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,320
And all the other qué ché.

1228
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,320
Maple...

1229
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,320
says...

1230
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,320
Love is purple.

1231
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:54,320
Excuse me.

1232
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,320
Love is orange.

1233
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,320
Maple says...

1234
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:01,520
what

1235
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,720
past the mormon

1236
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:04,720
just look at me

1237
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:07,720
i am more in charge

1238
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:14,720
that's what you get both

1239
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:22,720
So I would actually run around wearing orange if you ever pitched because that kicks the ball.

1240
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:27,720
So I'd be like, excuse me, this is the...anyway, back to back to back.

1241
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,720
Can I read Maples F.U. now?

1242
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:30,720
No, I will.

1243
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:33,720
You want to? Go ahead. No, now you're good at it.

1244
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:34,720
Fuck is fuck you.

1245
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:43,720
Fuck you to my sickness, making me sleep a huge amount of hours and missing the Super Bowl.

1246
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:48,000
well you didn't miss anything Raiders got fucked in the ass and they played a

1247
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:57,840
matrix trailer there's the Super Bowl like a fruit bowl yeah

1248
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:08,460
cold bowling orange mouse goes cold one without you listeners without you

1249
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:15,400
listeners in private yeah uh ddr angel says my one fu for this week goes to people who

1250
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:18,840
are your best friends who are supposed to support you and your decisions no matter what

1251
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:22,080
but they end up disagreeing with you and making you feel shitty even though you're making

1252
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:27,080
a decision you believe in i have to move it off okay if a person is showing your friends

1253
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:31,080
that they feel like something you're doing is going to end up hurting you in the long

1254
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:36,080
run they are a better person to not be supporting you in the long run

1255
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:57,080
And if your friend sees something or has experience like that, that you know is going to say that

1256
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:01,080
this experience that you're going through right now is going to come back and bite you

1257
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:11,080
invite you in the ass, you better listen to your friends advice, especially if that person has the experience with no one. Don't discount your friend, just because they're showing a little bit of dis-discovery, ok?

1258
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:16,080
Unless they're drunk, then don't listen to them.

1259
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:17,080
Yeah, they're drunk too.

1260
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:20,080
Wow. This, this uh... orange lounge suddenly got deep.

1261
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:27,080
You know, it's an experience of mine. I just turned to somebody's advice one time, and I was really hurt for it.

1262
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:35,080
So, I always keep it up in mind whenever you're playing this video, try to stand up and say what you're doing.

1263
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:47,080
And don't listen to them when they say that some girl likes you, because even though they may be their best friend, and they may know them for years, they're wrong and lying to you.

1264
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:50,080
They were having a little bit of trouble hearing you, Jamie.

1265
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,080
They're having a little trouble hearing all of us, actually.

1266
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,080
I'm sorry, it's because of that buzz bug we're having.

1267
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:58,080
Let me turn off the music so you can hear Jamie good and loud.

1268
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,080
Alright.

1269
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,080
This is what I had to say.

1270
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:06,080
For whatever advice your friend is giving you, if they're going from experience,

1271
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:12,080
if they've had experience that maybe something that you're going through right now isn't necessarily something that might be good for you,

1272
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:23,080
If they see potential harm in what you're doing, you'd best appreciate that kind of advice because it takes a lot of bravery to tell your friends, I don't think what you're doing is the right thing.

1273
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:29,080
It takes a shallow person to just agree with everything just because they want to keep you as a friend.

1274
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:34,080
It takes a really strong person to say, I disagree with you and this is why.

1275
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:39,080
So, that's all it is. You just have to keep an open mind toward what your friends tell you.

1276
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:44,080
Alright. Although Angel says she was drunk, so...

1277
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:47,080
Okay, if this one was drunk, then just screw it.

1278
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:51,080
But still, we appreciated deep thoughts with Jamie.

1279
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:54,080
Now back to the pornography chat. Alright.

1280
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:57,080
Chubz says,

1281
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:03,080
I can't think of any FUs, so FU to Jack in the Box again for taking away the 99% Westerner.

1282
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:06,080
How was his FU last week?

1283
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,080
Alright.

1284
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:15,080
Stressa wants to get laid live on air, so he's volunteering to come down for that show.

1285
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:19,080
Stressa, we'll take you to the Bunny Ranch.

1286
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:20,080
Alright.

1287
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,080
Chat Cookie says, Fuck you, Black Lab.

1288
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,080
You're just jealous of my chocolate chips.

1289
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:29,080
Also, I want to send out a nephew to everyone that's envious of my sweet perfections.

1290
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:32,080
That was a robot.

1291
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:38,620
And now, 23rd Vegas has a special little F.U. this week.

1292
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:41,980
And I'm even giving him his own song because he begged and pleaded enough and I just wanted

1293
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:43,960
him to stop begging because it was getting sad.

1294
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:46,840
So he's saying,

1295
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:50,180
My life is so full of bliss, I have no F.U. for the week.

1296
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:51,980
I do, however, have something different.

1297
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:54,860
I'd like to send a love you to DGR Angel.

1298
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:57,740
Will you be my Bamani girl?

1299
01:27:57,740 --> 01:27:59,020
Not just that, something deeper.

1300
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:03,600
I love you, and I'm willing to make sure we are together and forever.

1301
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:04,600
How about you?

1302
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:06,660
Will you stay with me forever?

1303
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:10,240
That was cute.

1304
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:15,820
Too many serious moments here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1305
01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:20,020
And people getting laid, and it's not me, and that makes me cry.

1306
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:26,020
Oh, but I am getting a massage, so maybe I like wall-er-ing in my pity here.

1307
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:29,520
Why are you crying?

1308
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:30,520
You want to go give...

1309
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:31,520
Hey, stop it.

1310
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,520
Go give her a massage.

1311
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:33,520
Yes she...

1312
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:34,520
Yes she does.

1313
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:35,520
What?

1314
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:36,520
What?

1315
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,520
Listen, touch me and I'll break your finger.

1316
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,600
Well, wait a minute.

1317
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:41,600
You're complaining about...

1318
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:42,600
I am not a cryman.

1319
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:43,600
Hold on.

1320
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,200
You're complaining about not getting...

1321
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:48,920
You're complaining about not getting any, uh, massages and then Brad's all, okay, I'll

1322
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:49,920
give you a massage.

1323
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,920
You're like, touch me and I'll break your finger.

1324
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:51,920
My shoulder's hurting.

1325
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:52,920
It makes me angsty.

1326
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:53,920
Oh.

1327
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,920
Oh.

1328
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:02,920
Brad! Brad! I need oral service!

1329
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,920
Dad, say something.

1330
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:08,920
So, you know what, we never did get the answer here.

1331
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,920
It's like, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

1332
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:12,920
AHHHH!

1333
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:13,920
FFFF!

1334
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,920
Yeah.

1335
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:21,920
I bet I went to private message. Teehee.

1336
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,920
Well, that's not fair!

1337
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:26,920
Oh no, we got big hugs. Big tugs.

1338
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:31,920
And oh my god, OMG! We got an OMG! OMG!

1339
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,920
OMG! OMG!

1340
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,920
Yeah, you know me!

1341
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:40,920
Okay, moving on. Let's see, I'm checking some...

1342
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:42,920
You down with entropy?

1343
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:48,920
Alright, let's check the mailboxes. I forgot to check the mail.

1344
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:20,920
Omg, omg, omg, omg, omg, omg!

1345
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:54,920
I know I've got one. I know I'm trying to find it. Here it is. Okay, some booty dance menu. Here you go. We'll be back.

1346
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:19,920
You can't touch this

1347
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:20,920
You can't touch this

1348
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:25,920
My, my, my, my music you make me so hard Make me say, oh my boy, thank you

1349
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,920
For blessing me with a mind too loud and too high

1350
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,920
It feels good when you know we are down

1351
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,920
I took a little homeboy from the off town and I'm known

1352
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,920
It's such a good feeling, you can't touch

1353
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:36,920
I told you homeboy, you can't touch this

1354
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:38,920
Yeah, that's how we livin' and you know

1355
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:40,920
You can't touch this

1356
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:41,920
Look at my eyes, man

1357
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,920
You can't touch this

1358
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,920

Hold on a minute, before my back, let em know

1365
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,520
That you're a true up, if this is a news up

1366
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,520
They can't touch

1367
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,520
Yo I told you, you can't touch this

1368
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:10,520
While you stand in there man, you can't touch this

1369
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:12,520
Yo sound a bit of school jig, ducker

1370
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:14,120
You can't touch this Give me a song

1371
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:16,120
I'm making them sweat, that's what I'm giving them now

1372
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:19,120
Say no, you talk about the hell when you're talking about a show that's tight

1373
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:22,120
And tight, singles I've spent so fast in my wife gonna take

1374
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:25,120
Two words, what you gonna take in the 90s to rise the charts

1375
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:28,120
Legit, if you fall, you might as well quit

1376
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:30,120
That word, cause you know

1377
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:31,120
You can't touch this

1378
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,120
You can't touch this

1379
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:35,120
Break it down!

1380
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:36,120
Stop!

1381
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:37,120
Hammer time!

1382
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,120
Every time you see me, my hammer's just so high

1383
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:39,120
I'm dope on the floor and I'm battling for the fight

1384
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:40,120
Now why would I ever stop doing this?

1385
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:41,120
With all the same expectations and just no hits

1386
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:42,120
I told them about the world, from London to America

1387
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,120
It's happening all the time

1388
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:44,120
It's happening all the time

1389
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:45,120
It's happening all the time

1390
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:57,120
Throw it like you mean it, blow

1391
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:11,120
Let me hear you say

1392
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:25,120
Louder, let me hear you say Louder, is that what you call loud?

1393
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:31,120
Come on, let me hear you say Let me hear you say

1394
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:40,120
Louder, I said louder You need to bring the beat back

1395
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:12,120
You

1396
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:58,120
The following bit of randomness has been brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

1397
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:00,120
Dateline, the Muppet Show.

1398
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:04,120
It has been reported just moments ago that a large heavy object was dropped from the ceiling.

1399
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:06,120
Further developments will...

1400
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:07,120
Hey, will you go up there and ask?

1401
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:10,120
About the biggest berry I've ever seen, Diggleberry!

1402
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:49,420
My brother is a Marine, and he has to go to Kuwait next month, so fuck all of them.

1403
01:37:49,420 --> 01:37:53,640
I agree, I think the, I think, I can't understand when like there's all these countries that

1404
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:58,760
are against the war, but you know what, he ain't popular with me, of course I wouldn't

1405
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:05,120
have ever voted for the guy in first place, but yeah, I agree, I think the whole war is

1406
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:08,120
stupid, and I think Bush is just asking for trouble, and he's not going to get re-elected.

1407
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:14,120
I voted Donald Duck. Donald Duck in two thousand and, what, four? Two thousand four.

1408
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:19,120
I think when his re-election comes up, we should all vote for Strong Bad.

1409
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:21,120
Okay, we'll vote for Strong Bad, that's fine.

1410
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:23,120
From Homestar Runner.

1411
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:29,120
Everybody, go to HomestarRunner.com after the show, and read the Strong Bad email.

1412
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:30,120
Alright.

1413
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:34,120
We've said our piece because we don't want to turn this into a completely political show.

1414
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:38,120
I just want to send them a letter that says fuck you right in your ear because your ass ain't good enough.

1415
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:08,120
We could. Do you have anything actual?

1416
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:12,120
Yeah, give us a sim update. Let's get the show back on track.

1417
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:16,120
Yay! Yay!

1418
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:20,120
Earlier this week, well actually, a couple websites are going through a couple changes.

1419
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:24,120
We had a big Bomani-style bitchfest going on.

1420
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:28,120
And they're redoing some stuff.

1421
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:32,120
Supposedly they didn't like the fact that people were leeching files off their site.

1422
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:38,440
site. I'm sorry, you don't mean the Bimani style, you mean, hold on, keep going, never

1423
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:43,400
mind, I've got to get something queued up here. Okay, yeah, other than that, DDRManiaX,

1424
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:49,280
they had a whole site relaunch with a brand new design to it, so it's kind of pretty,

1425
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:53,960
and so that's pretty cool to have that going on. See, other than that, Bimani style is

1426
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:58,720
releasing a brand new, well actually they're the same DDRXtreme files, but now they have

1427
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:04,860
backgrounds in them. Woohoo! So those will be coming up pretty soon. They have like three

1428
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:11,540
up right now. And let's see, other than that, here let me cut you off for just a second

1429
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:23,540
because I wanted to say, it's not Bahmani style, it's Bahmani style because god damn,

1430
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:28,460
they do everything for this community. They bend over backwards and they died on the cross

1431
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:29,460
for this community.

1432
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:30,460
Wha.

1433
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:34,820
It's like every, uh, those aren't my CDs, actually.

1434
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:37,900
Yeah, they're like, we post files and you're not, and now you're binging.

1435
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:38,900
I swear those aren't my CDs.

1436
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:39,900
I don't know if they are.

1437
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:40,900
The rest of our site.

1438
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:41,900
Wha.

1439
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:43,820
Anyways, um, so that's, that's that.

1440
01:40:43,820 --> 01:40:49,060
I'm hoping that with the creation of Leech from Loki, uh, that, um, or actually finishing

1441
01:40:49,060 --> 01:40:53,560
putting up the website that I meant to do last week but because my Linux screwed up

1442
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:58,780
my computer for three days didn't get to it site, um, hopefully that'll be like, okay,

1443
01:40:58,780 --> 01:41:02,600
well, you're leeching from us, go leech from him, because he doesn't care, and that's the

1444
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:03,600
whole thing.

1445
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:06,040
Are you gonna put the announcer files up on your site, chat rooms wondering?

1446
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:11,400
Yes I am, and I've ripped the announcer files from DDA Extreme with, uh, yee-haw! So we've

1447
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:12,560
got that on there too.

1448
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:16,520
And I'm not slamming on any other websites, by the way, but just, you know, the whole

1449
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:21,240
Jesus complex, it's the internet, everybody leeches from everybody, that's the whole concept.

1450
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:25,240
If you don't want people to be doing it, don't post it.

1451
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:28,240
I mean, it doesn't make sense, you guys. Stop.

1452
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:30,240
Be nice. Be nice to each other. That's all we want.

1453
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:32,240
Well, here's another thing.

1454
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:34,240
They're wondering why people are turned away from this site.

1455
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:35,240
Well, let's see. Here's some of their mods.

1456
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:37,240
They've got Slip. Slip's a mod on that site.

1457
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:40,240
I don't want to get into personally bashing people on this show.

1458
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:42,240
Actually, he had some pretty funny comments.

1459
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:43,240
I like reading his stuff.

1460
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:46,240
I mean, even when he's ripping on stupid people, that's hilarious.

1461
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:47,240
Hilarious.

1462
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:51,200
But yeah, other than that, let's see some stuff I forgot last week.

1463
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:57,800
There was this, it was a DDR, sort of a money-related DDR,

1464
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:01,760
like e-magazine type thing that went out.

1465
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:03,560
It had some pretty funny stuff.

1466
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,960
I wanted to print it out, but it was on my zip drive,

1467
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:07,520
so unfortunately I couldn't do that.

1468
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:11,920
It was kind of all right, made by some Canadians, I think.

1469
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:15,200
See, aside from all that stuff.

1470
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:29,200
Oh, DWI Insanity, they just released Easy to Dancer songs, a whole pack of those that are DWIs now, so go check those out. Those are pretty cool. Links on DDR Maniacs if you want to check that out.

1471
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:36,200
And always just keep watching their forums. There's going to be files to release and whatnot.

1472
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:43,200
CDDR East Coast Invasions is going to be doing another tourney mix, I'm sure, tourney mix 4.

1473
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:48,200
They're talking about doing one every three months, I think, so I'll probably put it in April.

1474
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:56,200
And they're also running a contest right now, where it's a bmoni music remixing contest.

1475
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:58,200
You just pick songs, remix them.

1476
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:03,200
They have to be anywhere from one and a half minutes to, I believe, four minutes in length.

1477
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:08,200
And you win a mixed CD with all of the winners on it.

1478
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:09,200
Ooh!

1479
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:10,200
Yeah, so.

1480
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:14,200
BlackLab wants to know, when is there going to be a DDR sim for Macs, god damn it?

1481
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:15,200
For what?

1482
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:16,200
Macs.

1483
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:17,200
Macintoshes.

1484
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:18,200
For Macs?

1485
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:21,200
Um, well there sort of is right now.

1486
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:28,200
There's um, uh, I don't know, I remember there was one that was for multiple platforms.

1487
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:35,200
I don't think it was PyDDR, but there was one that was from multiple platforms that I posted a long time ago.

1488
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:37,200
But yeah, I don't know.

1489
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:41,200
Alright, he's just Max, so that's why they don't make Sims for him.

1490
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:45,200
Dude, get out of his lap, man!

1491
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:48,200
Giving him a lap dance during the show.

1492
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:53,200
And no news on Feta Fury. It's supposed to be finished in March, I think.

1493
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:58,200
Yeah, Feta's Fury. Yeah!

1494
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:03,200
I know the game's so bad it makes you grow up and kill people.

1495
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:08,200
But Fury.

1496
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:13,200
Black Lab wanted me to ask if you guys were interested in doing...

1497
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:17,540
There's actually some new programming coming to Orange Lounge in the very new future.

1498
01:44:17,540 --> 01:44:21,420
We have the Johnny the Homicidal Maniac special, the drama that's going to be...when is that

1499
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:22,420
finished?

1500
01:44:22,420 --> 01:44:23,420
Do we know when that's going to be finished?

1501
01:44:23,420 --> 01:44:24,420
I feel sick.

1502
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:25,420
Yeah, I feel sick, thank you.

1503
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:26,420
I don't really know.

1504
01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:27,420
I haven't heard from the show.

1505
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:30,000
I actually have to re-record my lines with the psychic lady.

1506
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Ah, okay.

1507
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,920
We're going to be having a new music show coming that's going to be debuting soon, as

1508
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:39,560
soon as I get the list from you guys, and I haven't even told Logie about it yet.

1509
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:43,560
I'm always on loop, both at work and life and everything.

1510
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:46,560
But you guys will be sending me these.

1511
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:47,560
We're going to have a long version program.

1512
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:51,560
We've had a lot of requests to play more long version of Bahmani Musics.

1513
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:54,560
So we're going to have a Bahmani Music block at some point.

1514
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:59,560
We might do it at a certain time every day for like an hour, but just like some long versions,

1515
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:03,560
because we've had some requests to play more long stuff on Orange Long's radio.

1516
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:06,560
So we're going to do long versions of your favorite Bahmani songs.

1517
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,560
I like it long.

1518
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:10,900
yes, because you guys like it long and hard. So we'll be doing that. That's a new show

1519
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:15,540
coming to Orange Lawn very soon. And Black Lab's suggesting that we, since we've turned

1520
01:45:15,540 --> 01:45:20,260
into a soap opera here, we can do a show called As the Orange Turns. And it can be this whole

1521
01:45:20,260 --> 01:45:26,260
side project, another show with voice acting and everything. And Black Lab wants to see

1522
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:32,560
if anyone would want to do it. That sounds like fun. Jamie's raised her hand. So we could

1523
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:46,460
like all over act on air and stuff. Shut up you bastard! I'm not going to let you see

1524
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:53,340
your baby. Oh yeah, well I'm an alien twin from another planet. I came here to steal

1525
01:45:53,340 --> 01:46:08,340
I don't have any multiple personalities, but my other ones do. All five of them. And they're

1526
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:09,340
twins.

1527
01:46:09,340 --> 01:46:10,340
And mine.

1528
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:15,340
It was like this, y'all! It's so cool!

1529
01:46:15,340 --> 01:46:18,340
Okay.

1530
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:20,340
We're not nerds here!

1531
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:22,340
Anyways.

1532
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:24,340
So is that all you had to say about SimNews?

1533
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:30,340
Uh, there's nothing going on because people are lazy and school and distracted by the Super Bowl and...

1534
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:34,340
I want some of your nuts, Brad. These are good, thank you.

1535
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:38,340
You know, I'm a non-nut person. I hate nuts. Nuts suck.

1536
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:41,340
I don't like nuts, man.

1537
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:43,340
Your cashews are in the living room, dear.

1538
01:46:49,340 --> 01:46:52,340
Alright, we're gonna get to the cage match now, finally.

1539
01:46:52,340 --> 01:46:57,340
So, last week in the big, fat, hairy, scary cage match.

1540
01:46:57,340 --> 01:47:01,340
You know what, I don't even have a song picked for this weekend, so I've got to pick it like right now.

1541
01:47:01,340 --> 01:47:03,340
No, I'm gonna do it.

1542
01:47:03,340 --> 01:47:04,340
You already won.

1543
01:47:04,340 --> 01:47:05,340
Alright.

1544
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:06,340
No, you can pick his own.

1545
01:47:06,340 --> 01:47:07,340
Here we go.

1546
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:14,340
Remember, you can pick your friends and you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friend's cage match song.

1547
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:24,340
Last week, on the Orange Mountain Cage Match, we had a very narrow victory over that Eat Em Up song by FX Twin.

1548
01:47:24,340 --> 01:47:30,340
The winner of last week's cage match was Ayumi Hamasaki with M, the Above and Beyond remix.

1549
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:36,340
Oh, by the way, the cage match, for those that don't know, we played three songs, most just picked each song.

1550
01:47:36,340 --> 01:47:41,340
And you can vote. You can vote for last week's winner. You can vote for one of the two new songs.

1551
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:48,340
And the winning song goes into rotation during Orange Lounge Radio's Blumani Music and More program,

1552
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:51,340
which plays all the time on this station when we're not here.

1553
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:55,340
So this is last week's winner. We're only going to play a small clip of it.

1554
01:47:55,340 --> 01:47:57,660
This is Ayumi Hamasaki with M, and you can vote for this.

1555
01:47:57,660 --> 01:47:59,660
This is the first thing you can vote for in this week's stage match.

1556
01:49:27,660 --> 01:49:45,500
Alright, that was last week's winner, AyumiHamasaki with M, so that's the first thing you can

1557
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:46,500
vote for.

1558
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:47,500
And...

1559
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:51,660
And, uh, you know what, I don't give a fuck if this is, uh, you know, a little, uh, private

1560
01:49:51,660 --> 01:49:52,660
shit.

1561
01:49:52,660 --> 01:49:53,660
Okay, go ahead.

1562
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:57,540
Listen, you fucking bitch twin, I didn't fucking diss slip, I was making a comment

1563
01:49:57,540 --> 01:50:02,360
about how slip causes people that not want to be talking on the forums because anyone

1564
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:06,520
that says anything stupid, he will go off on them. I didn't say anything bad about that.

1565
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:11,460
That's cool, because, you know, people like doing that. Hell, I like joking with stupid

1566
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:16,140
people and making fun of them. That's my thing. So I didn't make fun of slip at all, you know

1567
01:50:16,140 --> 01:50:20,400
what, and they're doing a good job on that site even though, you know, they don't like

1568
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:24,520
leeches and that kind of thing, but hey, that's their thing. I didn't ever say anything bad

1569
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:28,360
about slip at all so you know what you go fuck yourself and you're fucking bad

1570
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:32,380
I'm not talking to you mister I think you're my best friend guess what go fuck

1571
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:37,560

1573
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:46,560
the off chance that there's one of you listening do yourselves a favor and ban

1574
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:51,240
twin from your channel that's it I realized I realized we don't get along

1575
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:54,240
We don't see eye-to-eye on everything, dudes that run that place.

1576
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:55,240
But you know what?

1577
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:58,240
Honestly, human-to-human, just do yourself a favor, ban them.

1578
01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:00,240
First of all, you know what?

1579
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:05,240
And as for twin, I put twin in the same category that I put slip.

1580
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:07,240
People I don't pay attention to.

1581
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:09,240
Alright, fair enough. No more personal drama on this show.

1582
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:11,240
Didn't we say fuck drama earlier? Look at that.

1583
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:12,240
Well, I'm saying fuck it now.

1584
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:14,240
I know, I know. I know, it's stupid.

1585
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:16,240
Can we do a cage match now? Yes.

01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:17,240

Alright, neat. That was in the cage match. Vincent D'Amore with Eternity, the full vocal

1643
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:12,480
remix and now I have a I have a controversial pic for this week's cage

1644
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:16,100
match oh I'm sorry yes we have to go around the room and rate it up my bad

1645
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:20,580
ten for eternity any particular reason why

1646
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:25,580
the world. It appeals to the music feeling good in my head.

1647
01:55:25,580 --> 01:55:28,580
Alright. Loki!

1648
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:33,580
I liked it, but it's like, it's just, I don't know, it's just a bit more.

1649
01:55:33,580 --> 01:55:38,580
It's an 8, I don't know, because I like all the stuff, but it's not even like a scandal.

1650
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:40,580
Woah! It's something I never heard before.

1651
01:55:40,580 --> 01:55:44,580
Uh, you didn't even hear the song, did you? That we just did.

1652
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:45,580
What song?

1653
01:55:45,580 --> 01:55:47,580
Uh, Eternity by more.

1654
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:48,580
I've heard it.

1655
01:55:48,580 --> 01:55:49,580
What do you think?

1656
01:55:49,580 --> 01:55:53,580
I think it's very classic. I agree with both of you.

1657
01:55:53,580 --> 01:55:57,580
I jumped out and was like, holy crap!

1658
01:55:57,580 --> 01:56:01,580
But it's really good. I like it. It's very classic.

1659
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:05,580
For a hand, I'd rate it about a seven.

1660
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:09,580
Overall, I'd rate it a nine.

1661
01:56:09,580 --> 01:56:13,580
Alright, Vincent D'Amore. I love Vincent D'Amore. I give it a nine.

1662
01:56:13,580 --> 01:56:17,580
Eternity. It's not the best Vincent D'Amore song, but it's pretty damn cool and I wouldn't be

1663
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:29,340
I have a kind of controversial one. This is from a trance compilation, and unfortunately

1664
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:33,520
I don't have the name of the artist that did this. I have it somewhere, I just don't have

1665
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:37,860
it on me right now. I can tell you this comes from the Velfire Cyber Trance compilation.

1666
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:43,960
This is track 4, and this is a remix of Thunderstruck, which was by ACDC originally, which is a group

1667
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:48,840
I don't particularly care for usually, but I know Jamie really likes them, and she does not like this mix at all.

1668
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:50,840
I already know what I'm giving it.

1669
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:56,720
it one alright but judge for yourself this is the third entry in the cage mess

1670
01:56:56,720 --> 01:57:03,720
this week. It's a remix of Thunderstruck. Enjoy.

1671
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:27,720
Thunder

1672
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:32,720
I was caught in the middle of a railroad track

1673
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:33,720
Thunder

1674
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:39,720
I was small and I knew there was no turning back

1675
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:40,720
Thunder

1676
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:45,720
My, my life and I thought what could I do

1677
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:46,720
Thunder

1678
01:57:46,720 --> 01:57:52,720
And I knew there was no help, no help from you

1679
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:59,720
Thunder

1680
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:05,720
Thunder

1681
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:12,720
Thunder

1682
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:19,720
Thunder

1683
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:21,720
Thunder

1684
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:28,720
Thunder

1685
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:35,720
Thunder

1686
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:45,720
Thunder

1687
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:50,720
Thunder

1688
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:25,720
Yeah

1689
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:30,720
Yeah

1690
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:35,720
Yeah

1691
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:37,720
Yeah!

1692
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:40,720
Thunder

1693
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:30,240
All right, that was from the Velfire Cybertron CD, Thunder, a little recent.

1694
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:33,240
We're about to throw up, I guess.

1695
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:36,240
All right, Jamie, dare I ask, what did you think of Thunder?

1696
02:00:36,240 --> 02:00:37,240
Negative 12.

1697
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:53,240
Sorry, I love this song. And I like how they split the guitar mix with the keyboard mix, but I hate that it exists. That's the song. You should never transmit AT-AT.

1698
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:09,240
It doesn't make any sense.

1699
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:11,240
No. Off of one.

1700
02:01:11,240 --> 02:01:13,240
Even better, uh...

1701
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:15,240
Um...

1702
02:01:15,240 --> 02:01:17,240
What'd you think of that, Brad?

1703
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:19,240
I caught, like, the last five seconds.

1704
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:21,240
And I...

1705
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:23,240
Give it a ten.

1706
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:25,240
I didn't hear it, but now that I...

1707
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:27,240
I think I understand what it was. It was thunderstorms?

1708
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:29,240
Yeah, but it was cool for internet.

1709
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:31,240
Oh yeah, that was cool.

1710
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:33,240
Woo!

1711
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:35,240
Dude, that DJ should be...

1712
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:40,800
The game should be blacklisted. It's never really allowed to be recorded.

1713
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:46,400
All right, fine. Then I'm giving it a ten simply to counterweight the rest of your votes.

1714
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:51,520
I'm sorry, but you're dealing with two ones and a minus twelve? Your ten loses!

1715
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:53,720
I give it a ten! Ten, ten, ten!

1716
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:55,640
It gives an overall of negative one.

1717
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:57,800
Oh, he gave it a zero. He gave it a one.

1718
02:01:57,800 --> 02:01:59,880
I gave it a minus twelve.

1719
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:01,200
All right.

1720
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:02,400
I gave it a zero.

1721
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:05,000
Yay, Loki!

1722
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:09,240
So send in your votes right now over a private message in the channel and we'll tally up

1723
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:11,420
those votes and have it for you later.

1724
02:02:11,420 --> 02:02:22,800
You can vote for either Ayumi Hamasaki, you can vote for Vincent D'Amore with Eternity,

1725
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:37,480
Oh, gee, I guess there are no exciting parts, sorry.

1726
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:41,280
And then, uh, the trance remix of Thunderstruck that nobody likes here at Orange Lounges and

1727
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:42,280
Me.

1728
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:51,420
All right, so you can vote for any one of those right now.

1729
02:02:51,420 --> 02:02:52,420
Right fucking now!

1730
02:02:52,420 --> 02:02:53,420
It should be called Blunder.

1731
02:02:53,420 --> 02:02:54,420
Blunderstruck.

1732
02:02:54,420 --> 02:02:59,900
And the winner goes into rotation.

1733
02:02:59,900 --> 02:03:00,900
On the Bill Monte Music War.

1734
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:01,900
I'm gonna be on the microphone, you're gonna give us a disease.

1735
02:03:01,900 --> 02:03:05,780
Alright, I'm gonna give you all an STD live on air.

1736
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:09,300
Hi, I'm getting weird looks.

1737
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:13,080
AIDS for everyone!

1738
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:15,420
That's going in the next intro.

1739
02:03:15,420 --> 02:03:18,540
That was a winner.

1740
02:03:18,540 --> 02:03:23,740
I'm going to give all the little underprivileged children in the world AIDS, myself.

1741
02:03:23,740 --> 02:03:25,740
You're awful!

1742
02:03:25,740 --> 02:03:27,740
You're an awful person!

1743
02:03:27,740 --> 02:03:32,740
Brad will give them all AIDS, and I'll give them a kick in the ass.

1744
02:03:32,740 --> 02:03:35,220
Yes, because I'm Jared Fogle from Subway.

1745
02:03:35,220 --> 02:03:39,420
You'll give them AIDS and I'll give them a yeast infection.

1746
02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:43,420
Wait a minute!

1747
02:03:43,420 --> 02:03:47,220
Do you keep it in a jar or something so you can just open it up, a can of yeast infection

1748
02:03:47,220 --> 02:03:57,420
What disease would you like to transmit?

1749
02:03:57,420 --> 02:04:02,260
I can transmit the stupid, I guess.

1750
02:04:02,260 --> 02:04:06,260
I have the rockin pneumonia and the boogie woogie food.

1751
02:04:06,260 --> 02:04:09,340
What disease do you want to transmit, Rob?

1752
02:04:09,340 --> 02:04:11,180
What disease do I want to transmit?

1753
02:04:11,180 --> 02:04:13,300
2dx.

1754
02:04:13,300 --> 02:04:16,340
I want to transmit mental retardation.

1755
02:04:16,340 --> 02:04:27,900
I want to transmit the gay gene.

1756
02:04:27,900 --> 02:04:29,860
Remember you already infected my Pepsi bong.

1757
02:04:29,860 --> 02:04:30,860
Anal warts.

1758
02:04:30,860 --> 02:04:31,860
No.

1759
02:04:31,860 --> 02:04:34,740
What was that tournament that we were at Spigle for that day?

1760
02:04:34,740 --> 02:04:35,740
Spigle 2.

1761
02:04:35,740 --> 02:04:37,740
No, we were just there for randomness.

1762
02:04:37,740 --> 02:04:38,740
Were we?

1763
02:04:38,740 --> 02:04:40,020
Yeah, it was a random trip to Spigle.

1764
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:46,220
I got, this one they had the big bone, Pepsi bone drinks, but I called it the Pepsi bong.

1765
02:04:46,220 --> 02:04:52,220
I asked Rob if he was thirsty, so he took a drink, and then I gave it back, and I took a drink, and he was like,

1766
02:04:52,220 --> 02:04:57,220
I was like, Noah's like, sorry, I'm getting mixed up.

1767
02:04:57,220 --> 02:05:02,220
Here, I don't have any diseases, and then he drank it, and then gave it to me, and I had a drink, and he goes, I have gay.

1768
02:05:02,220 --> 02:05:07,220
I was like, oh no, I don't want women!

1769
02:05:07,220 --> 02:05:10,220
And then I hugged our mane.

1770
02:05:10,220 --> 02:05:11,220
Ow!

1771
02:05:11,220 --> 02:05:16,220
We need some hot lesbian action on orientation. We need to call up Amanda and Jana and get them back on there.

1772
02:05:16,220 --> 02:05:21,220
You know what's sad, though, is that Jana moved to the Bay Area to be with Amanda.

1773
02:05:21,220 --> 02:05:26,220
Sorry, I don't want to see my ex-girlfriend having lesbians.

1774
02:05:26,220 --> 02:05:31,220
Well, what if your current girlfriend had lesbian sex? Would that be okay?

1775
02:05:31,220 --> 02:05:36,220
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

1776
02:05:36,220 --> 02:05:37,220
involved.

1777
02:05:37,220 --> 02:05:44,460
Then it wouldn't be officially lesbian, but hey, I'm not complaining.

1778
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:48,580
Any straight guy that wants to see lesbian sex has this thought in the back of his head

1779
02:05:48,580 --> 02:05:53,020
that it's not really lesbian sex because they'll be all, oh gosh, we're having lesbian sex

1780
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:58,100
and it's so great, but we really need a dick right now, join in.

1781
02:05:58,100 --> 02:06:03,980
What they don't know is that they don't want the dick, I mean, they're lesbians, they hate

1782
02:06:03,980 --> 02:06:14,380
What I don't get is why guys are so hot about seeing two chicks getting it on.

1783
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:17,380
What did you say earlier in the show about wanting to have that room at Golf Land where

1784
02:06:17,380 --> 02:06:20,140
the hot guys get it on with each other?

1785
02:06:20,140 --> 02:06:27,140
But yet, a certain significant other of mine has a problem with me wanting to see two guys

1786
02:06:27,140 --> 02:06:28,140
get it on.

1787
02:06:28,140 --> 02:06:29,140
Why?

1788
02:06:29,140 --> 02:06:31,980
Because he's jealous of my Gucci collection.

1789
02:06:31,980 --> 02:06:32,980
Same thing.

1790
02:06:32,980 --> 02:06:35,980
Just gender. Just cocks.

1791
02:06:35,980 --> 02:06:39,980
Well, if you just can't... Just cock?

1792
02:06:39,980 --> 02:06:42,980
I don't... We're all adults here.

1793
02:06:42,980 --> 02:06:45,980
I don't understand what the problem would be. I mean, it's like...

1794
02:06:45,980 --> 02:06:48,980
I mean, hell, if I saw two lesbians, I wouldn't expect to be jumping in.

1795
02:06:48,980 --> 02:06:52,980
I mean, hello, lesbian. Meaning they don't have sex with men.

1796
02:06:52,980 --> 02:06:57,980
You're just watching. It's like a porno without the TV and without the videotape.

1797
02:06:57,980 --> 02:07:01,980
Oh, and welcome to the real life, you know, thing here. Most lesbians are pretty ugly.

1798
02:07:01,980 --> 02:07:14,980
For guys, I think it's okay because I think it's an easier time for guys to get it on, so women should actually have the advantage in seeing the gal we think.

1799
02:07:14,980 --> 02:07:21,980
But, you know, it's harder for girls to be stimulating with tools.

1800
02:07:21,980 --> 02:07:23,980
I'm confused, maybe.

1801
02:07:23,980 --> 02:07:24,980
It's more effort.

1802
02:07:24,980 --> 02:07:25,980
For girls, too?

1803
02:07:25,980 --> 02:07:27,980
I think so.

1804
02:07:27,980 --> 02:07:29,980
You have to have skill.

1805
02:07:29,980 --> 02:07:35,980
See, girls, they have access to the equipment 24-7, so they know exactly what to do.

1806
02:07:39,980 --> 02:07:43,980
I'm talking about how I jack my hot spicy boner every day, guys!

1807
02:07:43,980 --> 02:07:47,980
Yeah, see, guys can get themselves off at any given time, okay?

1808
02:07:47,980 --> 02:07:49,980
And girls can, too! It just takes a little longer.

1809
02:07:49,980 --> 02:07:50,980
Not necessarily!

1810
02:07:50,980 --> 02:07:51,980
I'm sorry, Jim.

1811
02:07:51,980 --> 02:07:53,980
I'm not elaborating on that, though.

1812
02:07:55,980 --> 02:07:56,980
Chat Room, what do you think?

1813
02:07:56,980 --> 02:07:57,980
Yes, talk to us.

1814
02:07:57,980 --> 02:07:58,980
Who has an easier time getting off?

1815
02:07:58,980 --> 02:08:02,980
How many girls are in the chat room now that can tell us how quickly to get off?

1816
02:08:02,980 --> 02:08:05,980
I think it would take absolutely nothing for a guy to get off.

1817
02:08:05,980 --> 02:08:06,980
Yeah, it could take me about 10 seconds.

1818
02:08:06,980 --> 02:08:08,980
Guys' top boners are the most stupid things.

1819
02:08:08,980 --> 02:08:11,980
Dude, when I first saw Metroid Prime...

1820
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:14,980
Oh...

1821
02:08:14,980 --> 02:08:17,980
You mean you don't get a kalidon?

1822
02:08:17,980 --> 02:08:20,980
Remember the porno last night? They were talking about kalidons.

1823
02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:23,980
It doesn't work that way.

1824
02:08:23,980 --> 02:08:25,980
It does not work that way.

1825
02:08:25,980 --> 02:08:27,980
Because we're more sophisticated beings.

1826
02:08:27,980 --> 02:08:30,980
Oh, oh, wait a minute. Hold on.

1827
02:08:30,980 --> 02:08:34,980
It takes more to simulate a woman.

1828
02:08:34,980 --> 02:08:37,980
It takes diesel-powered equipment.

1829
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:41,980
Michael, I have to seriously give you that.

1830
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:44,980
I gotta give you a copy of that sex-court TV, the movie.

1831
02:08:44,980 --> 02:08:46,980
That's hilarious. She has, she has, okay.

1832
02:08:46,980 --> 02:08:51,980
You know how they have those, um, uh, those, like, hedge clippers?

1833
02:08:51,980 --> 02:08:53,980
You know, with the blade that goes up and down?

1834
02:08:53,980 --> 02:08:57,980
Okay well imagine that but you strap a dildo to it and she's just like REEEE!

1835
02:08:57,980 --> 02:08:58,980
REEEEEEEE!

1836
02:08:58,980 --> 02:09:01,980
Going at it with that.

1837
02:09:01,980 --> 02:09:02,980
Alright.

1838
02:09:02,980 --> 02:09:05,980
I think we're going to take a quick break and try to get the show out of the toilet.

1839
02:09:05,980 --> 02:09:06,980
Umm...

1840
02:09:06,980 --> 02:09:07,980
When we come back...

1841
02:09:07,980 --> 02:09:08,980
I found a funny site.

1842
02:09:08,980 --> 02:09:09,980
Oh dear.

1843
02:09:09,980 --> 02:09:13,980
I was looking for JoJin, she enacted out a site, I think it's gone now, called assmachine.

1844
02:09:14,980 --> 02:09:15,980
Jesus!

1845
02:09:17,980 --> 02:09:22,980
Where it had these like, these, some really hot guys in the site though.

1846
02:09:22,980 --> 02:09:29,060
But it was these different machines they made with dildos on them and guys attached to them.

1847
02:09:29,060 --> 02:09:30,660
It was funny.

1848
02:09:30,660 --> 02:09:34,340
I was looking for Dildinci and I found this.

1849
02:09:34,340 --> 02:09:37,460
This show is more in the potty than any other show we've done in the past.

1850
02:09:37,460 --> 02:09:38,460
Awful.

1851
02:09:38,460 --> 02:09:40,980
What about the cage match?

1852
02:09:40,980 --> 02:09:41,980
We're going to tally up those votes during the break.

1853
02:09:41,980 --> 02:09:44,640
We're going to get a break and try to be unfilty.

1854
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:45,640
We're going to do the break.

1855
02:09:45,640 --> 02:09:46,640
We're going to try to unfilty ourselves.

1856
02:09:46,640 --> 02:09:50,580
When we come back, we're going to do a segment we did a couple weeks ago that was kind of

1857
02:09:50,580 --> 02:09:51,580
fun.

1858
02:09:51,580 --> 02:09:52,580
The ass machine!

1859
02:09:52,580 --> 02:09:55,180
No, we'll do, uh, how about Ask Orange Lounge?

1860
02:09:55,180 --> 02:09:56,180
We can do that segment again.

1861
02:09:56,180 --> 02:09:56,680
Ask!

1862
02:09:56,680 --> 02:09:58,680
We're gonna do Ask Orange Lounge, no.

1863
02:09:58,680 --> 02:10:00,680
Yes, you can play a song during the break.

1864
02:10:00,680 --> 02:10:02,680
Yes, Loki's gonna pick the song during the break here.

1865
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:03,980
I think he just went Squeen, didn't you?

1866
02:10:03,980 --> 02:10:05,980
And when we come back, we're gonna do Ask Orange Lounge.

1867
02:10:05,980 --> 02:10:06,480
Whoo!

1868
02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:07,980
Because, uh, it's fun.

1869
02:10:07,980 --> 02:10:09,980
Remember, Ask Machine.

1870
02:10:11,580 --> 02:10:12,380
I think the song went well.

1871
02:10:12,380 --> 02:10:12,880
Alright.

1872
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:13,980
Well, okay.

1873
02:10:13,980 --> 02:10:15,980
Loki's gonna give us a song during the break as well, but...

1874
02:10:15,980 --> 02:10:19,780
First, uh, we'll play something from Bomani, because we...

1875
02:10:19,780 --> 02:10:21,180
And, um, my song...

1876
02:10:21,180 --> 02:10:21,980
What is that?

1877
02:10:21,980 --> 02:10:32,980
My song is going to be coming from a punk band that I know called The Secretions, and this is from their debut CD called Till Death, and the song we'll be playing is called Boner.

1878
02:10:32,980 --> 02:10:33,980
Okay, cool.

1879
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:35,980
They're going to love it. After some Tack.

1880
02:10:35,980 --> 02:10:36,980
I like Boners.

1881
02:10:36,980 --> 02:10:38,980
We're going to hear a Tack song and then we'll get to that.

1882
02:10:38,980 --> 02:10:40,980
Alright, here we go!

1883
02:11:38,980 --> 02:11:40,980
Oh

1884
02:12:38,980 --> 02:13:06,980
You're here for me, but as everyone can see, everything about you changes my anatomy.

1885
02:13:06,980 --> 02:13:10,980
The way you smack your gum while you're beating on your drum

1886
02:13:10,980 --> 02:13:13,980
It makes me wanna jerk off your mum, is just feeling numb

1887
02:13:13,980 --> 02:13:16,980
The best time is against you when you hold me

1888
02:13:16,980 --> 02:13:19,980
So you can witness firsthand what you do to me

1889
02:13:19,980 --> 02:13:23,980
That's not a pickle in my pocket, that's my purple passion rocket

1890
02:13:23,980 --> 02:13:26,980
It's getting set to blast off just for you

1891
02:13:26,980 --> 02:13:28,980
For you

1892
02:13:28,980 --> 02:13:31,980
Baby, you make me pop a boater

1893
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:35,980
You make me live with my erectile shoe drive

1894
02:13:35,980 --> 02:13:40,980
Baby, you make me pop a boner I think about you every day

1895
02:13:40,980 --> 02:13:42,980
It's you I wanna lay

1896
02:13:48,980 --> 02:13:51,980
You twinkle in your eye I mix the lump between my thighs

1897
02:13:51,980 --> 02:13:54,980
I'm the bread, you're the oven You make my biscuit rise

1898
02:13:54,980 --> 02:13:58,980
I'm gonna kiss you where it stinks Touch you where it stinks

1899
02:13:58,980 --> 02:14:01,980
Do the things that money says you shouldn't honor think

1900
02:14:01,980 --> 02:14:05,980
Gonna brush my lips against you when you hold me

1901
02:14:05,980 --> 02:14:08,980
So you can really just pretend what you do to me

1902
02:14:08,980 --> 02:14:10,980
That's not a pickle in my pocket

1903
02:14:10,980 --> 02:14:12,980
That's my purple passion rocket

1904
02:14:12,980 --> 02:14:15,980
Said you said you'd laugh up just for you

1905
02:14:15,980 --> 02:14:17,980
For you

1906
02:14:17,980 --> 02:14:20,980
Baby, you make me pop a boner

1907
02:14:20,980 --> 02:14:24,980
You make me feel alive when my erect eye shoots lies

1908
02:14:24,980 --> 02:14:27,980
Baby, you make me pop a boner

1909
02:14:27,980 --> 02:14:29,980
I think of Christ here every day

1910
02:14:29,980 --> 02:14:31,980
It's you I wanna lay

1911
02:14:36,980 --> 02:14:37,980
Hello?

1912
02:14:37,980 --> 02:14:39,980
I know what you're thinkin' here to get down

1913
02:14:39,980 --> 02:14:42,980
You're just a dirty old man trying to get down my pants

1914
02:14:42,980 --> 02:14:44,980
Well, that's not entirely true

1915
02:14:44,980 --> 02:14:46,980
It seems I happen to think you're beautiful

1916
02:14:46,980 --> 02:14:47,980
I happen to think you're intelligent

1917
02:14:47,980 --> 02:14:49,980
I happen to think you have a wonderful sense of humor

1918
02:14:49,980 --> 02:14:52,980
In fact, I might let you play with my dogs

1919
02:14:52,980 --> 02:14:54,980
Cause I might be falling in love with you

1920
02:14:54,980 --> 02:14:56,980
Look at the time, every time I see you

1921
02:14:56,980 --> 02:14:57,980
I wanna rip your clothes off

1922
02:14:57,980 --> 02:15:01,740
And if you feel orgasm, then so Godyourage can give you

1923
02:15:01,740 --> 02:15:05,660
I know I can do it, and most of all, you know I can do it

1924
02:15:07,320 --> 02:15:09,900
Baby, you make me pop a boner

1925
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:11,680
To make me feel alive

1926
02:15:11,680 --> 02:15:13,780
When my erectile tissue glides

1927
02:15:13,780 --> 02:15:16,460
Baby, you make me pop a boner

1928
02:15:16,460 --> 02:15:18,560
I think about you every day

1929
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:20,080
You are one way

1930
02:15:20,080 --> 02:15:23,140
Baby, you make me pop a boner

1931
02:15:23,140 --> 02:15:25,060
To make me feel alive

1932
02:15:25,060 --> 02:15:27,500
When my erectile tissue glides

1933
02:15:27,500 --> 02:15:32,500
Hey, hey, you make me pop a boner I think I'll punch you every day

1934
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:34,500
It's you I wanna lay

1935
02:15:39,500 --> 02:15:43,500
This is my guitar fix pick for the week, this is Pain with Fight

1936
02:15:43,500 --> 02:16:04,780
Bored, drinking my beer on the floor Surrounded by people I'm mostly at war

1937
02:16:04,780 --> 02:16:10,620
Wanting more And so the night goes, a lot of beer blows

1938
02:16:10,620 --> 02:16:12,320
What can a guy do to make it right?

1939
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:15,820
And then abruptly my pair of eyes see a pair of guys get into a fight

1940
02:16:18,020 --> 02:16:19,420
What do y'all think is pretty?

1941
02:16:19,420 --> 02:16:21,620
I can make the whole life better

1942
02:16:21,620 --> 02:16:22,920
Everybody loves to fight

1943
02:16:22,920 --> 02:16:23,420
Fight!

1944
02:16:23,420 --> 02:16:24,620
Everybody loves to fight

1945
02:16:24,620 --> 02:16:25,120
Fight!

1946
02:16:31,420 --> 02:16:34,120
I'll wash you like a bottle

1947
02:16:36,520 --> 02:16:39,220
This wine

1948
02:16:39,220 --> 02:16:46,220
Hit him in the eye, knocked him on the ground

1949
02:16:46,220 --> 02:16:49,220
Now, he starts to cry

1950
02:16:49,220 --> 02:16:51,220
I don't mean to be, obviously mean

1951
02:16:51,220 --> 02:16:53,220
Trying to love each other, that's the way it should be

1952
02:16:53,220 --> 02:16:55,220
But don't you think that maybe every once in a while

1953
02:16:55,220 --> 02:16:56,220
A good fit might make everyone smile?

1954
02:16:56,220 --> 02:16:58,220
But now if I can strike the ice

1955
02:16:58,220 --> 02:17:00,220
And make the whole life better

1956
02:17:00,220 --> 02:17:02,220
Everybody loves to fight

1957
02:17:02,220 --> 02:17:03,660
Everybody! Let's go fight!

1958
02:17:10,100 --> 02:17:10,980
Hey, what do you want?

1959
02:17:10,980 --> 02:17:11,740
Get a little!

1960
02:17:11,880 --> 02:17:12,900
Here comes the gang!

1961
02:17:12,900 --> 02:17:13,400
Let's go!

1962
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:14,540
Woah-haa!

1963
02:17:14,560 --> 02:17:15,060
Yaah!

1964
02:17:15,060 --> 02:17:15,560
Oah!

1965
02:17:15,560 --> 02:17:16,060
Aah!

1966
02:17:16,060 --> 02:17:16,560
Aah!

1967
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:17,060
Ooh!

1968
02:17:17,060 --> 02:17:17,560
Aah!

1969
02:17:17,560 --> 02:17:18,060
Aah!

1970
02:17:18,060 --> 02:17:18,560
Woohoo!

1971
02:17:18,560 --> 02:17:19,060
Aah!

1972
02:17:19,060 --> 02:17:19,560
Aah!

1973
02:17:19,560 --> 02:17:20,060
Aah!

1974
02:17:20,060 --> 02:17:20,560
Aah!

1975
02:17:20,560 --> 02:17:21,060
Woohoo!

1976
02:17:21,060 --> 02:17:21,560
Aah!

1977
02:17:21,560 --> 02:17:22,060
Aah!

1978
02:17:22,260 --> 02:17:22,760
Aah!

1979
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:23,260
Ooh!

1980
02:17:23,260 --> 02:17:23,760
Aah!

1981
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:24,260
Aah!

1982
02:17:24,260 --> 02:17:24,760
Aah!

1983
02:17:24,760 --> 02:17:25,260
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1984
02:17:25,260 --> 02:17:27,260
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1985
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:35,260
Blood

1986
02:17:35,260 --> 02:17:38,260
Deep broken glass on the floor

1987
02:17:40,260 --> 02:17:44,260
And if the fight's right, the fighters just might decide to be friends and make amends

1988
02:17:44,260 --> 02:17:48,260
And as we get closer to the end, it's time to sing the chorus once again!

1989
02:17:48,260 --> 02:17:52,260
And the arms like they're freaky, I can take the whole life better!

1990
02:17:52,260 --> 02:18:12,140
Hey, now we've got a special request. One more song here. This is over the email request,

1991
02:18:12,140 --> 02:18:19,140
So this is for Yumi, Tyra, that would like to hear some highs off you, so here you go.

1992
02:18:42,140 --> 02:18:46,140
Higher than higher

1993
02:18:46,140 --> 02:18:50,140
I'll take you higher

1994
02:18:50,140 --> 02:18:52,140
Stop screaming and try to look hard

1995
02:18:52,140 --> 02:18:53,140
I give my body up, you did that retard

1996
02:18:53,140 --> 02:18:55,140
I'm a veteran, which means that I've been

1997
02:18:55,140 --> 02:18:57,140
In the game too long since the days of X-Men

1998
02:18:57,140 --> 02:18:59,140
Way back when, I've been putting it down

1999
02:18:59,140 --> 02:19:01,140
Ask the homie who's the baddest, get your wrist out of town

2000
02:19:01,140 --> 02:19:03,140
I'm so like a butterfly, sing like a meme

2001
02:19:03,140 --> 02:19:04,140
Spectacular over M-I-C

2002
02:19:04,140 --> 02:19:06,140
I don't provoke, never giving it less than the best

2003
02:19:06,140 --> 02:19:08,140
Rock the ears in the game, that's your request

2004
02:19:08,140 --> 02:19:10,140
You like to rhyme, break into jail

2005
02:19:10,140 --> 02:19:12,140
I kick a pecker so I don't care

2006
02:19:12,140 --> 02:19:14,140
Why that's me, seem a victim to me

2007
02:19:14,140 --> 02:19:16,140
What a real MC is supposed to be

2008
02:19:16,140 --> 02:19:18,140
Fucking duck every time that I drop it

2009
02:19:18,140 --> 02:19:20,140
Rock-a-boom-a, baby, I don't need such a spot

2010
02:19:20,140 --> 02:19:22,140
I got the beat and the ride

2011
02:19:22,140 --> 02:19:24,140
Rock the party, rock the party, rock the party

2012
02:19:24,140 --> 02:19:28,140
Higher than higher

2013
02:19:28,140 --> 02:19:32,140
I'm doing it like fire

2014
02:19:32,140 --> 02:19:36,140
Higher than higher

2015
02:19:36,140 --> 02:20:03,180
We, indeed, welcome back to Orange Lawns Radio, episode number 30.

2016
02:20:03,180 --> 02:20:04,180
Do it again.

2017
02:20:04,180 --> 02:20:05,180
Live.

2018
02:20:05,180 --> 02:20:10,460
We didn't even really talk about this. This is episode number 30. We're over the hill now.

2019
02:20:10,460 --> 02:20:11,820
No, that's 40.

2020
02:20:11,820 --> 02:20:13,340
Over the hill is 40. Sorry, my bad.

2021
02:20:13,340 --> 02:20:15,980
Well, when I hit 30, I'm going to be crying because I think I'm over the hill.

2022
02:20:15,980 --> 02:20:17,180
We're at our sexual peak.

2023
02:20:17,180 --> 02:20:21,020
Yes, we're at our sexual peak. Oh, that's what's happening to this show tonight. I get it.

2024
02:20:21,020 --> 02:20:26,380
Orange Lawn's radio is at its female sexual peak.

2025
02:20:26,380 --> 02:20:29,500
Yeah, I've been there and back.

2026
02:20:29,500 --> 02:20:30,940
You mean you've done a 30-year-old?

2027
02:20:30,940 --> 02:20:33,580
You've done a 30-year-old?

2028
02:20:33,580 --> 02:20:37,540
No. Would you?

2029
02:20:37,540 --> 02:20:40,860
Talking about women here, right? Yes.

2030
02:20:40,860 --> 02:20:43,900
Maybe. If she was hot enough.

2031
02:20:43,900 --> 02:20:47,180
I did one that was 28, does that count? No. Oh, okay.

2032
02:20:47,180 --> 02:20:51,700
I was 17. No, I'm kidding, I was 15. She may not necessarily be hot,

2033
02:20:51,700 --> 02:20:55,740
but was incredibly skilled.

2034
02:20:55,740 --> 02:21:00,240
Room's dark enough to hang. She swallows, Loki, she swallows. Did you ever see that

2035
02:21:00,240 --> 02:21:02,240
What was that show that was on HBO?

2036
02:21:02,240 --> 02:21:04,240
To be honest, I don't even give a shit about it.

2037
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:09,240
No, not real sex. It had the guy who was a writer and his wife left him and married a politician.

2038
02:21:09,240 --> 02:21:12,240
And he was in the hospital one time, blinded.

2039
02:21:12,240 --> 02:21:17,240
And he did this one nurse, and the nurse was, you know, really good and everything.

2040
02:21:17,240 --> 02:21:20,240
He got his vision back and she was like 50.

2041
02:21:20,240 --> 02:21:24,240
You know, but see, now the whole thing with the swallowing, I don't even get that.

2042
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:27,240
I mean, who cares? That sucks.

2043
02:21:27,240 --> 02:21:31,240
Okay, she gets the best out of both worlds. She gets to eat and she gets to have sex.

2044
02:21:31,240 --> 02:21:33,240
What the fuck is up with that?

2045
02:21:33,240 --> 02:21:40,240
If I could have a pizza and be getting head at the same time, man, I'd be the happiest guy in the world, man.

2046
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:43,240
You're eating pizza? Hey, good job.

2047
02:21:43,240 --> 02:21:46,240
You know what? I don't see why people are so fascinated with that.

2048
02:21:46,240 --> 02:21:49,240
I don't even understand that. It's stupid. It's like, oh, I smell it.

2049
02:21:49,240 --> 02:21:55,240
I want to know what the advantage of putting something in your mouth that a guy pisses with.

2050
02:21:55,240 --> 02:21:55,740
OK.

2051
02:21:58,440 --> 02:22:03,160
Well, it goes both ways, you know.

2052
02:22:06,560 --> 02:22:07,920
All right.

2053
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:11,520
We're going to do a segment here that we did a couple of weeks

2054
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:12,640
ago that everybody loved.

2055
02:22:12,640 --> 02:22:14,240
So we're doing it again.

2056
02:22:14,240 --> 02:22:15,720
It's called Ask Orange Lounge.

2057
02:22:15,720 --> 02:22:17,440
That's right.

2058
02:22:17,440 --> 02:22:20,120
You can send us your questions over private message

2059
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:22,560
to me in the chat room right now.

2060
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:25,440
And we'll answer them live here on air.

2061
02:22:25,440 --> 02:22:29,280
We're going to start with a question from USFBB, who says,

2062
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:33,400
I am trying to compile a list of places to have sex.

2063
02:22:33,400 --> 02:22:35,800
OrangeLoungeCast, please help me.

2064
02:22:35,800 --> 02:22:39,360
And I wanted to clarify, he is in Vegas, and he says yes.

2065
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:41,920
And he already has listed at the Tropicana

2066
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:44,080
because they have mirrors on the ceiling in every room.

2067
02:22:44,080 --> 02:22:45,680
So the Tropicana is taken care of.

2068
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:50,080
So places the USFBB needs to have sex?

2069
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:50,920
In Vegas.

2070
02:22:50,920 --> 02:22:52,200
I've never been to Vegas.

2071
02:22:52,200 --> 02:22:54,200
I've never been to Vegas. I've been to Vegas.

2072
02:22:54,200 --> 02:22:58,200
You need to have sex at Gypsy.

2073
02:22:58,200 --> 02:23:01,200
Hopefully he catches the reference.

2074
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:05,200
What's that place that was in Shoot Girls?

2075
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:07,200
The Cheetah.

2076
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:08,200
Yeah, you need to get a lap dance at the Cheetah.

2077
02:23:08,200 --> 02:23:11,200
Okay, you need to get a lap dance at the Cheetah.

2078
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:14,200
And then run a nice room at the Monte Carlo.

2079
02:23:14,200 --> 02:23:16,200
Okay.

2080
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:18,200
Yeah, Monte Carlo's good.

2081
02:23:18,200 --> 02:23:20,200
What else do you need to do for sex?

2082
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:26,200
There's so many whorehouses. You know what? You need to have sex in the desert next to a cactus. I think that would be fun.

2083
02:23:26,200 --> 02:23:32,200
I'm gonna eat it. Eat some peyote and then have sex.

2084
02:23:32,200 --> 02:23:35,200
Okay, cool. You get some free sex flyers too. That would be cool.

2085
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:40,200
You can get those cards that have the transgender women on there.

2086
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:44,200
Yes, you need to have sex with somebody transgender. That would work.

2087
02:23:44,200 --> 02:23:51,200
You know how they have those lunch carts where they punch them and stuff? You need to get one of those for a prostitute, because that'd be hilarious.

2088
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:53,200
Okay, cool.

2089
02:23:53,200 --> 02:24:01,200
Where else in Vegas does he need to have sex? How about on top of that spinning guitar at the Hard Rock Hotel?

2090
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:04,200
The basement at the Excalibur.

2091
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:06,200
The basement of the Excalibur.

2092
02:24:06,200 --> 02:24:08,200
On the Technomotion Machine.

2093
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:09,200
Ah, okay, on the Technomotion Machine.

2094
02:24:09,200 --> 02:24:10,200
Emotion.

2095
02:24:10,200 --> 02:24:20,200
You know what? You need to have sex at Caesar's Palace in the forums, like on the fountain with the animatronic Neptune guy. That's where you need to have sex.

2096
02:24:20,200 --> 02:24:22,200
On top of the pirate ship that burns.

2097
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:26,200
Yes! On a pirate ship in Treasure Island. Good, good one.

2098
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:29,200
Go on the one that sinks while it's sinking.

2099
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:35,200
Have sex on the sinking boat at Treasure Island. That's our answer. That's where you need to have sex.

2100
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:37,200
Alright. Hope that helped.

2101
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:42,200
Black Lab asks, Puppy wants to know

2102
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:45,320
based on everyone that we've met on this show

2103
02:24:45,320 --> 02:24:49,480
if everyone there in Channel Orange Lounge

2104
02:24:49,480 --> 02:24:54,720
and the studio were to get into a big fight, who would win? I'm not sure I quite

2105
02:24:54,720 --> 02:24:55,920
understand that question

2106
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:59,720
are you saying everybody in the chat room currently versus the three of us?

2107
02:24:59,720 --> 02:25:03,680
or you need to clarify who's fighting? That's what we need to know

2108
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:09,680
Who exactly is fighting here? We don't know who's winning unless we know who's fighting.

2109
02:25:09,680 --> 02:25:17,680
Of our guests, I'd probably say that Melody would win.

2110
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:21,680
Which Melody? We've had two Melodies. We had Angel Melody and then we had Mel B's girlfriend Melody.

2111
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:22,680
Why'd you do?

2112
02:25:22,680 --> 02:25:24,680
Okay, so that would be Shark's Girl Melody, yes?

2113
02:25:24,680 --> 02:25:25,680
Because she's badass.

2114
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:27,680
Oh no, I think she's badass.

2115
02:25:27,680 --> 02:25:28,680
Alright.

2116
02:25:28,680 --> 02:25:31,680
Of us, I would win.

2117
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:33,680
Wait, the three of us got in a fight? You mean you would win?

2118
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:35,680
All I have to do is kick both of you in the balls.

2119
02:25:35,680 --> 02:25:37,680
We could kick you in the boob.

2120
02:25:37,680 --> 02:25:40,680
You've got two of them. One foot each.

2121
02:25:40,680 --> 02:25:42,680
Yeah, but you know what? Guys see that coming right away.

2122
02:25:42,680 --> 02:25:44,680
I mean, this is like a big target.

2123
02:25:44,680 --> 02:25:46,680
Just say, hit me here.

2124
02:25:46,680 --> 02:25:48,680
I mean, we're expecting that, okay?

2125
02:25:48,680 --> 02:25:51,680
I'll smack you both in my purse if I have the time.

2126
02:25:51,680 --> 02:25:53,680
Whatever.

2127
02:25:53,680 --> 02:25:55,680
Yeah, we need to know who's fighting.

2128
02:25:55,680 --> 02:25:56,680
So Black Lab Cl-

2129
02:25:56,680 --> 02:25:58,680
Uh, everyone for themselves.

2130
02:25:58,680 --> 02:25:59,680
Ah, I see.

2131
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:06,920
so let's see I would say who would who would lose who would lose the fight

2132
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:15,680
first you think that's true yes that would that would be to lose shine lose

2133
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:20,520
right there of the folks in there right now you know what I think I think Chubbs

2134
02:26:20,520 --> 02:26:24,480
would kick a lot of ass yeah I think Chubbs would lay the smack down I think

2135
02:26:24,480 --> 02:26:27,480
How did he go to come down all the chubs in Mel B?

2136
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:33,480
Mel's not in the chat right now, but he's been on the show before. I think that's where the fight would come down.

2137
02:26:35,480 --> 02:26:37,480
I think Wendell would kick some ass, too.

2138
02:26:37,480 --> 02:26:39,480
Dude, Wendell would kick all kinds of ass.

2139
02:26:39,480 --> 02:26:45,480
That's true, but Wendell's never been... Oh, Wendell's been in the segments, on the interview segments, so I guess that counts.

2140
02:26:47,480 --> 02:26:52,480
Dude, but I think that overall, Jahi would own everybody, just the personality alone.

2141
02:26:52,480 --> 02:26:54,480
Drew, Jahi would yell everybody to death.

2142
02:26:54,480 --> 02:26:56,480
Yeah.

2143
02:26:56,480 --> 02:26:58,480
He's my great defender anyway.

2144
02:26:58,480 --> 02:27:03,480
Alright, so that's your answer. That's who'd win a fight.

2145
02:27:03,480 --> 02:27:07,480
Alright, moving along here with Ask Orange Lounge.

2146
02:27:07,480 --> 02:27:09,480
We're running out of questions. We need more.

2147
02:27:09,480 --> 02:27:10,480
Yeah, question us.

2148
02:27:10,480 --> 02:27:14,480
You can also send us questions over email to orangeloungeradio.yahoo.com

2149
02:27:14,480 --> 02:27:18,480
and we'll answer those live on air as well.

2150
02:27:18,480 --> 02:27:21,480
Remember, if you ask a personal question, we don't necessarily have to answer.

2151
02:27:21,480 --> 02:27:28,480
If you ask a really, really personal question, we may not answer, or we'll make something up.

2152
02:27:28,480 --> 02:27:33,480
Okay. Ah! There's an interesting question from Shadow.

2153
02:27:33,480 --> 02:27:36,480
Speaking of personal questions...

2154
02:27:36,480 --> 02:27:44,480
Jamie, what is the best position for giving the chicks the best sexual satisfaction?

2155
02:27:44,480 --> 02:27:48,480
Jamie continues doing her nails.

2156
02:27:48,480 --> 02:27:50,480
Are you gonna answer it, or are you gonna tell him to?

2157
02:27:50,480 --> 02:27:52,480
The mechanical one.

2158
02:27:52,480 --> 02:27:54,480
Oh!

2159
02:27:54,480 --> 02:27:58,480
So basically guys are incapable, so give it up.

2160
02:27:58,480 --> 02:27:59,480
Yeah.

2161
02:27:59,480 --> 02:28:00,480
Okay.

2162
02:28:00,480 --> 02:28:05,480
I don't think a guy can pleasure a woman as well as she can figure out how to pleasure herself.

2163
02:28:05,480 --> 02:28:07,480
Oh! Zing!

2164
02:28:07,480 --> 02:28:10,480
You would think that, yeah of course.

2165
02:28:10,480 --> 02:28:12,480
Apparently...

2166
02:28:12,480 --> 02:28:31,480
I agree with you there about porn being a comedy, that's just fun.

2167
02:28:31,480 --> 02:28:35,480
It's like, why try to inject plot with something that really needs none?

2168
02:28:35,480 --> 02:28:37,480
That's what I think.

2169
02:28:37,480 --> 02:28:41,480
Because it's funny.

2170
02:28:41,480 --> 02:28:45,480
Alright, moving on. We have another question from EOSFBB.

2171
02:28:45,480 --> 02:28:50,480
He has on his list, his list of places he wants to have sex, he says sex and a confessional.

2172
02:28:50,480 --> 02:28:53,480
Good kinkiness or morally wrong? Well...

2173
02:28:53,480 --> 02:28:56,480
Well, they had that contest going on the radio a while back.

2174
02:28:56,480 --> 02:29:01,480
I was going to say, Opie and Anthony, remember those kids? They got kicked off the air for that shit, so...

2175
02:29:01,480 --> 02:29:03,480
We can't really answer that, because we don't want to get...

2176
02:29:03,480 --> 02:29:05,480
Oh wait, we're on the internet. We can do whatever the fuck we want.

2177
02:29:05,480 --> 02:29:09,480
Go fuck in the changing room that the priests use.

2178
02:29:09,480 --> 02:29:12,480
Ah, that's better than the confessional.

2179
02:29:12,480 --> 02:29:14,480
You might walk in on them with a little boy or something.

2180
02:29:14,480 --> 02:29:16,480
Use the pew.

2181
02:29:16,480 --> 02:29:18,480
Sex in a pew?

2182
02:29:18,480 --> 02:29:20,480
Probably there would be pew.

2183
02:29:20,480 --> 02:29:22,480
I would be afraid to have sex in a church.

2184
02:29:22,480 --> 02:29:26,480
I think the problem with sex in a church is that I wouldn't be able to get it up.

2185
02:29:26,480 --> 02:29:29,480
I'd be too afraid of, like, lightning hitting me.

2186
02:29:29,480 --> 02:29:31,480
Okay.

2187
02:29:31,480 --> 02:29:33,480
We both just stare at each other.

2188
02:29:33,480 --> 02:29:34,480
Blink, blink, blink.

2189
02:29:34,480 --> 02:29:36,480
All right. See, that's the thing.

2190
02:29:36,480 --> 02:29:37,480
I don't think you can have sex in a church.

2191
02:29:37,480 --> 02:29:41,480
I don't think he'd be able to get it up, but if he can, hey, you're weird.

2192
02:29:41,480 --> 02:29:47,480
Alright. Oh, uh, Stresso would like to point out he hasn't gotten any complaints.

2193
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:50,480
But have you gotten compliments?

2194
02:29:50,480 --> 02:29:58,480
Yeah, uh, that's the thing. Women a lot of times, you know, they're not gonna see anything because they're afraid that, you know, that they'll hurt your feelings or something.

2195
02:29:58,480 --> 02:29:59,980
And then again there's those women that are like,

2196
02:29:59,980 --> 02:30:01,480
You fucking suck!

2197
02:30:01,480 --> 02:30:02,980
But, um...

2198
02:30:02,980 --> 02:30:04,980
Yeah, um...

2199
02:30:04,980 --> 02:30:06,980
I don't know, just do this, okay?

2200
02:30:06,980 --> 02:30:08,980
It looks like she's liking it.

2201
02:30:08,980 --> 02:30:10,480
Keep doing what you're doing.

2202
02:30:10,480 --> 02:30:13,480
If she doesn't like it, or it doesn't look like she's enjoying herself,

2203
02:30:13,480 --> 02:30:15,480
I mean, and you should be able to tell.

2204
02:30:15,480 --> 02:30:17,480
I mean, none of this, like, she's faking shit.

2205
02:30:17,480 --> 02:30:19,480
No, you can tell, okay?

2206
02:30:19,480 --> 02:30:21,480
Tell if she's liking it, then, uh...

2207
02:30:21,480 --> 02:30:23,980
If something's not working, then try something else.

2208
02:30:23,980 --> 02:30:27,980
Just experiment, you'll eventually find something that, you know, works really good.

2209
02:30:27,980 --> 02:30:30,980
And just keep doing that. You can only get better.

2210
02:30:57,980 --> 02:31:00,480
Oh yeah, listen under stationlive.org. They're back on the air now.

2211
02:31:00,480 --> 02:31:05,480
I can do Bomani stuff. We've got only like one more thing to talk about. Hold on, then I have to stop the music.

2212
02:31:07,480 --> 02:31:13,480
Okay, the only other Bomani thing that actually happened this week, the only thing that happened, actually two things.

2213
02:31:13,480 --> 02:31:26,480
Internet ranking for DDR Extreme came up, yay, and they found out if you play Paranoid Rebirth, get double A, play Paranoid Evolution, get double A, then you get to play Paranoid Survivor Max in DDR Extreme.

2214
02:31:26,480 --> 02:31:27,480
That's about it.

2215
02:31:27,480 --> 02:31:29,480
Okay, back to the ask questions thing.

2216
02:31:29,480 --> 02:31:31,480
All right, ask questions. Here we go, we got another question.

2217
02:31:32,480 --> 02:31:34,480
Hooray for people saving this segment.

2218
02:31:35,480 --> 02:31:38,480
Black Lab wants to... Oh, God damn it.

2219
02:31:38,480 --> 02:31:42,480
When is someone going to kidnap me and take me to Scandia for 2DX?

2220
02:31:42,480 --> 02:31:44,480
Um, soon?

2221
02:31:44,480 --> 02:31:46,480
Never.

2222
02:31:46,480 --> 02:31:48,480
No, I don't know.

2223
02:31:49,480 --> 02:31:51,480
You know, come to think of it...

2224
02:31:51,480 --> 02:32:07,480
Black Lap, plan on next weekend, if you can do it. Because what's happening, I'm going to Milpitas on Friday night, I'm going to a tournament there, and I'm staying with a friend over in the Bay Area Friday night, and then I'm going to be... By the way, I'll be doing interviews at the Milpitas tournament on Friday.

2225
02:32:07,480 --> 02:32:10,480
Next weekend, next Friday?

2226
02:32:10,480 --> 02:32:11,480
Yeah.

2227
02:32:11,480 --> 02:32:12,480
You know what next Friday is?

2228
02:32:12,480 --> 02:32:13,480
What's that?

2229
02:32:13,480 --> 02:32:16,480
It's Loki's Head to Contest number four!

2230
02:32:43,480 --> 02:32:50,120
I'm going to be going and then I'm going to be coming back on Saturday so I can swing

2231
02:32:50,120 --> 02:32:54,320
by Davis and get you on Saturday if you want and we'll go to Scania on Sunday.

2232
02:32:54,320 --> 02:32:57,400
I just thought of a guest who could kick everybody's ass.

2233
02:32:57,400 --> 02:32:58,400
What's that?

2234
02:32:58,400 --> 02:32:59,400
Shermie!

2235
02:32:59,400 --> 02:33:00,400
Shermie has been a guest on the show.

2236
02:33:00,400 --> 02:33:04,440
Do you think Shermie would claw Chubbs to death even?

2237
02:33:04,440 --> 02:33:05,440
She would out-cute him.

2238
02:33:05,440 --> 02:33:06,440
Oh!

2239
02:33:06,440 --> 02:33:07,440
And then Shermie would kick their ass.

2240
02:33:07,440 --> 02:33:08,440
That's interesting.

2241
02:33:08,440 --> 02:33:09,440
No!

2242
02:33:09,440 --> 02:33:10,440
Cute.

2243
02:33:10,440 --> 02:33:11,440
Alright.

2244
02:33:11,440 --> 02:33:12,640
Alright.

2245
02:33:12,640 --> 02:33:15,800
Shermie's the cutest guest we've ever had on the show, and you weren't here.

2246
02:33:15,800 --> 02:33:17,600
I know, I wasn't here, I'm sorry.

2247
02:33:17,600 --> 02:33:22,880
The one that was on the show at my house was Shermie, and she parted on the microphone.

2248
02:33:22,880 --> 02:33:26,320
She parted on the microphone? She purred!

2249
02:33:26,320 --> 02:33:29,080
My pussy.

2250
02:33:29,080 --> 02:33:32,560
People have met my Shermie.

2251
02:33:32,560 --> 02:33:37,960
My baby. My cat is cute, right?

2252
02:33:37,960 --> 02:33:39,440
Alright.

2253
02:33:39,440 --> 02:33:42,960
moving on ice as stress agrees to use the cutest pussy he's ever seen

2254
02:33:42,960 --> 02:33:47,520
yes alright more questions

2255
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:51,000
23rd maggots all he's got a money related question beautiful

2256
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:55,080
what are some of the easiest cat us I have for so far and I want to get more

2257
02:33:55,080 --> 02:33:55,760
under my bar

2258
02:33:55,760 --> 02:33:58,800
belt the question being cockamamie I feel

2259
02:33:58,800 --> 02:34:03,080
I feel I'm not a crisis in not a crisis my summer love

2260
02:34:03,080 --> 02:34:06,480
I think I think especially speeded up

2261
02:34:06,480 --> 02:34:10,480
Um, yeah, well then do you think I'm a Ryan78 cat?

2262
02:34:10,480 --> 02:34:15,480
Um, just about all the ones in Maxis that stay in Sodeep.

2263
02:34:15,480 --> 02:34:16,480
Which I'm close to Sodeep.

2264
02:34:16,480 --> 02:34:18,480
Twilight Zone, maybe not.

2265
02:34:18,480 --> 02:34:21,480
I would say Twilight Zone. Of course it depends.

2266
02:34:21,480 --> 02:34:24,480
It depends if you, because there's two types of people.

2267
02:34:24,480 --> 02:34:27,480
There's the people that can get the weird rhythms really easy.

2268
02:34:27,480 --> 02:34:32,480
So if you're that type of person you can get a Ryan78, I feel those kind of cat is no problem.

2269
02:34:32,480 --> 02:34:41,480
But then there's the stamina kind of people, who they don't really sometimes get the weird rhythms, but they got so much stamina they can run and run and run, and for them, easy caddas would be like Afronova.

2270
02:34:42,480 --> 02:34:51,480
But then you get those caddas that are both like Rhythm and Police, or so deep, and then you're just fucked. So those are like the last ones you'll probably pass.

2271
02:34:51,480 --> 02:34:54,480
I have issues with my stamina, partly from my asthma and having a bad knee and a bad ankle.

2272
02:34:55,480 --> 02:34:56,480
First cadda you guys ever passed?

2273
02:34:56,480 --> 02:34:57,480
Hypnotic Crisis.

2274
02:34:57,480 --> 02:34:58,480
Same here, Hypnotic Crisis.

2275
02:34:58,480 --> 02:35:00,480
What was the first cadda you ever passed, Libby?

2276
02:35:00,480 --> 02:35:04,480
First Cata I passed was on Doubles, and that was Make Your Move.

2277
02:35:04,480 --> 02:35:07,480
Make Your Move. Really? That was a Cata?

2278
02:35:07,480 --> 02:35:08,480
That's a Cata. That'd be damned.

2279
02:35:08,480 --> 02:35:10,480
Okay, second Cata you guys passed, do you remember?

2280
02:35:10,480 --> 02:35:12,480
Gratias Excivor.

2281
02:35:12,480 --> 02:35:13,480
Mine was Orion 7A.

2282
02:35:14,480 --> 02:35:15,480
La Senorita.

2283
02:35:15,480 --> 02:35:16,480
Doubles.

2284
02:35:16,480 --> 02:35:17,480
Doubles? What was the first-

2285
02:35:17,480 --> 02:35:20,480
I was better at Doubles than I was Singles for the longest time.

2286
02:35:20,480 --> 02:35:22,480
What was the first Singles Cata you passed?

2287
02:35:22,480 --> 02:35:23,480
I don't know if I remember.

2288
02:35:23,480 --> 02:35:25,480
I think it was Dead End.

2289
02:35:25,480 --> 02:35:25,480
Ah, okay.

2290
02:35:25,480 --> 02:35:26,480
Oh, no, no, no!

2291
02:35:26,480 --> 02:35:28,480
No, I do remember the easiest one to pass.

2292
02:35:28,480 --> 02:35:31,480
Paranoid Eternal, but with the 5th mix steps were heavy.

2293
02:35:31,480 --> 02:35:33,480
Ah, okay. Paranoid Eternal on 5th mix.

2294
02:35:33,480 --> 02:35:36,480
I know my 10th mix. Lupin, remember?

2295
02:35:36,480 --> 02:35:39,480
Lupin, yeah. I don't think Lupin's that easy, though.

2296
02:35:39,480 --> 02:35:41,480
We're at the party at, um...

2297
02:35:41,480 --> 02:35:42,480
Compared to other guys.

2298
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:44,480
...compared to our old 5th money parties back at the old...

2299
02:35:44,480 --> 02:35:47,480
I mean, we're so old school that every cat is easy now, but...

2300
02:35:47,480 --> 02:35:49,480
...on a home pad, on a modded home pad.

2301
02:35:49,480 --> 02:35:52,480
Went back, um, a couple days later, and, uh...

2302
02:35:52,480 --> 02:35:56,480
No, that was actually right before, um, the, uh, NGL 2.

2303
02:35:56,480 --> 02:36:00,480
I think the hardest katas are the ones that were on third base, actually.

2304
02:36:00,480 --> 02:36:03,480
I completely agree.

2305
02:36:03,480 --> 02:36:13,480
Well, they upgraded Paranoia Clean and End of the Century. I beat both of those.

2306
02:36:13,480 --> 02:36:15,480
Oh, yeah, the ones they up to are nice.

2307
02:36:15,480 --> 02:36:17,480
I beat Dead End. It actually took me out of the game.

2308
02:36:17,480 --> 02:36:21,480
Roke in my heart's the easiest kata.

2309
02:36:21,480 --> 02:36:31,480
And I actually did legitimately get Captain Jack.

2310
02:36:51,480 --> 02:36:53,480
I don't know, it was a pain in the ass for me for some reason.

2311
02:37:21,480 --> 02:37:26,480
I agree. I think that's by far the easiest cata currently.

2312
02:37:26,480 --> 02:37:31,480
If you do have good stamina, though, Wanda is actually not a bad one.

2313
02:37:31,480 --> 02:37:36,480
What's up, Brad?

2314
02:37:36,480 --> 02:37:38,480
First cata you ever passed?

2315
02:37:38,480 --> 02:37:43,480
I don't know because I never kept track of that shit. I just beat everything.

2316
02:37:43,480 --> 02:37:48,480
Oh, you're so leet!

2317
02:37:48,480 --> 02:37:52,480
My first seven, though, was Let Them Move.

2318
02:37:52,480 --> 02:37:53,480
What was Dead End?

2319
02:37:53,480 --> 02:37:54,480
Dead End's a nine.

2320
02:37:54,480 --> 02:37:57,480
Oh, okay, because I beat that way.

2321
02:37:57,480 --> 02:38:03,480
A lot of people did, though. It was harder for me, but I think it was a good examination.

2322
02:38:03,480 --> 02:38:09,480
One of the ones that I was really amazed I could get was Breakdown, though, because of the speed.

2323
02:38:09,480 --> 02:38:12,480
Another real easy one would be Paranoid Clean Mix.

2324
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:15,480
Yes.

2325
02:38:15,480 --> 02:38:18,480
But I remember when that was just an age.

2326
02:38:18,480 --> 02:38:20,480
It was like, I feel...

2327
02:38:20,480 --> 02:38:22,480
I feel so insane.

2328
02:38:22,480 --> 02:38:27,480
I don't know why people complain about it, because it actually does follow a path.

2329
02:38:46,480 --> 02:38:49,480
After the Game of Love.

2330
02:38:49,480 --> 02:38:59,080
any erotic song or secret rendezvous what mix we don't know what mix they're

2331
02:38:59,080 --> 02:39:03,480
gonna do a freestyle routine where they fuck on the DDR pad oh no I'm sorry I'm

2332
02:39:03,480 --> 02:39:07,320
sorry it's not a freestyle routine they're gonna star in a porno

2333
02:39:07,320 --> 02:39:12,320
Let's see... I would like to hear...

2334
02:39:12,320 --> 02:39:14,320
T-Love.

2335
02:39:14,320 --> 02:39:17,320
Yeah, T-Love would be pretty good, but I have to get Orion.

2336
02:39:17,320 --> 02:39:19,320
How about Boom Boom Dollar?

2337
02:39:19,320 --> 02:39:20,320
Cause you could, you know, thrust on the rhythm.

2338
02:39:20,320 --> 02:39:22,320
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

2339
02:39:22,320 --> 02:39:23,320
And then he could, like, be lip syncing to it.

2340
02:39:23,320 --> 02:39:24,320
It would be Pink Dinosaur.

2341
02:39:24,320 --> 02:39:25,320
Mighty Fine Dollar.

2342
02:39:25,320 --> 02:39:27,320
No, Pink Dinosaur.

2343
02:39:27,320 --> 02:39:29,320
Because it's about a penis.

2344
02:39:29,320 --> 02:39:31,320
Or, um, no, no, Walkie Talkie.

2345
02:39:31,320 --> 02:39:33,320
Just have, okay.

2346
02:39:33,320 --> 02:39:38,320
Multiple music, multiple different songs for each different scene. You're gonna have Blow My Whistle Bitch for the oral name.

2347
02:39:38,320 --> 02:39:39,320
Oh, Blow My Whistle Bitch!

2348
02:39:39,320 --> 02:39:45,320
Well, this is the thing, this is the thing. The OSFPB, he gave me the mix. They're gonna try to close Game Land and do it, and use DDREX.

2349
02:39:45,320 --> 02:39:47,320
So he can't do Blow My Whistle Bitch, that's not an EX.

2350
02:39:48,320 --> 02:39:52,320
I can say, all I can say is, I'm not gonna do a handclap on that machine ever again.

2351
02:39:52,320 --> 02:39:54,320
Yeah, right, like, okay, what the fuck did our game's gonna-

2352
02:39:54,320 --> 02:39:56,320
Oh yeah, go ahead, shoot a porno here.

2353
02:39:56,320 --> 02:39:57,320
Never know!

2354
02:39:57,320 --> 02:39:58,320
You never know!

2355
02:39:58,320 --> 02:40:00,320
He might be friends with the owner.

2356
02:40:00,320 --> 02:40:04,320
Don't you think Keith would let us shoot a porno?

2357
02:40:04,320 --> 02:40:06,320
No?

2358
02:40:06,320 --> 02:40:08,320
All right, maybe not.

2359
02:40:08,320 --> 02:40:10,320
Tandyos Family Entertainment.

2360
02:40:10,320 --> 02:40:12,320
Anyway, next question.

2361
02:40:12,320 --> 02:40:13,320
All right, next question.

2362
02:40:13,320 --> 02:40:15,320
We gave you plenty of good songs to choose from, Pikmin.

2363
02:40:15,320 --> 02:40:17,320
I still say butterfly.

2364
02:40:17,320 --> 02:40:19,320
All right.

2365
02:40:19,320 --> 02:40:22,320
Stressa says, I was playing AM radio today.

2366
02:40:22,320 --> 02:40:23,320
I hit a 200 combo.

2367
02:40:23,320 --> 02:40:25,320
I swear to God, this blue thing kind of reminded me of Tickman.

2368
02:40:25,320 --> 02:40:26,320
The Tick, whatever his name is.

2369
02:40:26,320 --> 02:40:33,320
jump out from the right side of the screen and screeched at me. What the fuck was that? Or is that something standard to an only course?

2370
02:40:56,320 --> 02:40:58,960
Cacento, which is the blue thing that you were talking about.

2371
02:40:58,960 --> 02:41:07,960
They also have one with Ver2, wearing the DDR pad, and the helmet.

2372
02:41:07,960 --> 02:41:09,360
It's hilarious.

2373
02:41:09,360 --> 02:41:11,040
But yeah, that's part of the new DDR.

2374
02:41:11,040 --> 02:41:14,160
That's the SM Extreme skin for that one.

2375
02:41:14,160 --> 02:41:15,440
But that one's pretty funny.

2376
02:41:15,440 --> 02:41:19,080
You still need to have an orange lounge skin first, I mean.

2377
02:41:19,080 --> 02:41:19,720
Don't look at me.

2378
02:41:19,720 --> 02:41:20,520
I'm not making one.

2379
02:41:20,520 --> 02:41:21,080
Why not?

2380
02:41:21,080 --> 02:41:23,760
Because I'm one easy, and I don't do skins.

2381
02:41:23,760 --> 02:41:25,080
That's true.

2382
02:41:25,080 --> 02:41:29,080
I can't even finish my one-step mania file I tried to make.

2383
02:41:29,080 --> 02:41:31,080
I'm gonna finish it and call it mine.

2384
02:41:31,080 --> 02:41:33,080
No, bastard.

2385
02:41:33,080 --> 02:41:35,080
Yeah.

2386
02:41:35,080 --> 02:41:37,080
Insertion.

2387
02:41:37,080 --> 02:41:40,080
Insertion? What about it?

2388
02:41:40,080 --> 02:41:43,080
Yeah, but insertion I think.

2389
02:41:43,080 --> 02:41:45,080
Every time I listen to insertion, I'm thinking it's boring.

2390
02:41:45,080 --> 02:41:49,080
It just sounds like boring music. It's got, like, a lot of bass.

2391
02:41:49,080 --> 02:41:50,080
You got the girl going,

2392
02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:54,080
Oh! Oh! Oh, Naoki, your tiny penis is so good!

2393
02:41:57,080 --> 02:41:58,080
Well, if there's not a pair of parrot machines...

2394
02:41:58,080 --> 02:41:59,080
More questions!

2395
02:41:59,080 --> 02:42:01,080
Yes, I'm getting to more questions. Here we go.

2396
02:42:01,080 --> 02:42:04,080
They're correcting you in the chat room, Loki. It was slim, not for two.

2397
02:42:04,080 --> 02:42:05,080
It's not worth it to do your bed.

2398
02:42:06,080 --> 02:42:07,080
Whatever.

2399
02:42:09,080 --> 02:42:11,080
Uh, DarkTetsuya has a question.

2400
02:42:11,080 --> 02:42:15,080
Will RedHotLive by Vanessa May ever make it into rotation?

2401
02:42:15,080 --> 02:42:17,080
If someone would send me the goddamn file...

2402
02:42:17,080 --> 02:42:18,080
I have it.

2403
02:42:18,080 --> 02:42:20,080
You better copy that for me.

2404
02:42:20,080 --> 02:42:22,080
DCC me that later.

2405
02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:24,080
Alright, I'll DCC it to Jamie.

2406
02:42:24,080 --> 02:42:26,080
We play around fuck-offs occasionally. Isn't that good enough?

2407
02:42:26,080 --> 02:42:29,080
Isn't shit we do here good enough for you? Jesus.

2408
02:42:31,080 --> 02:42:34,080
I don't know, Brad wasn't here. That's the part where Brad's supposed to go. Where?

2409
02:42:34,080 --> 02:42:36,080
We'll think about it.

2410
02:42:38,080 --> 02:42:40,080
We have no more questions. We're out of questions.

2411
02:42:41,080 --> 02:42:44,080
You have a question, Jamie? You want to ask OrangeLawn off something?

2412
02:42:44,080 --> 02:42:45,080
I want to ask our chair a question.

2413
02:42:45,080 --> 02:42:51,080
Oh, you want to... Ooh, reverse! I like this! Alright, fine. When they don't ask us questions, we're going to ask them questions.

2414
02:42:51,080 --> 02:42:54,080
Why won't you ask us another question?

2415
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:56,080
Come on, I thought you were going to ask them something good.

2416
02:42:56,080 --> 02:43:01,080
I want you to send me... I want you to send me some nice yowie.

2417
02:43:01,080 --> 02:43:05,080
Okay. Where should they email that to?

2418
02:43:05,080 --> 02:43:08,080
DarkSakuraIdolo.com

2419
02:43:08,080 --> 02:43:11,080
Alright, here we go. More questions.

2420
02:43:11,080 --> 02:43:15,080
That wasn't a question. Stresses says he still loves us.

2421
02:43:15,080 --> 02:43:17,080
Uh, he better.

2422
02:43:17,080 --> 02:43:20,080
Ah-ha! Good question from Black Lab. Very good question.

2423
02:43:20,080 --> 02:43:26,080
Black Lab wants to know when they're gonna see some hot monkey sex on the show.

2424
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:28,080
Where's the ferret?

2425
02:43:28,080 --> 02:43:30,080
I don't know where the ferret is.

2426
02:43:30,080 --> 02:43:31,080
Where's the ferret?

2427
02:43:31,080 --> 02:43:33,080
Did somebody kidnap the ferret?

2428
02:43:34,080 --> 02:43:36,080
Where's the ferret?

2429
02:43:37,080 --> 02:43:40,080
Oh my god, the ferret's gone. Is it up here?

2430
02:43:40,080 --> 02:43:41,080
You have a Furby.

2431
02:43:41,080 --> 02:43:43,080
Yeah, I know I have a Furby.

2432
02:43:43,080 --> 02:43:45,080
I don't know where the ferret went.

2433
02:43:45,080 --> 02:43:46,080
We're going to have to...

2434
02:43:46,080 --> 02:43:47,080
The ferret is missing.

2435
02:43:49,080 --> 02:43:51,080
Okay, we're going to have to find the ferret.

2436
02:43:51,080 --> 02:43:54,080
When will we have hot monkey sex on this show?

2437
02:43:56,080 --> 02:43:58,080
We'll see what we can do.

2438
02:44:00,080 --> 02:44:02,080
Maybe I'll go to the zoo and try to take some sex.

2439
02:44:02,080 --> 02:44:04,080
Dude, you saw the orangutans having sex.

2440
02:44:04,080 --> 02:44:06,080
You saw the orangutans having sex?

2441
02:44:06,080 --> 02:44:07,080
Yeah, I saw turtles.

2442
02:44:07,080 --> 02:44:09,080
You saw turtles fucking?

2443
02:44:09,080 --> 02:44:12,080
Yeah, Julian and I went for a school assignment, and I saw turtles fucking.

2444
02:44:12,080 --> 02:44:13,080
How was that?

2445
02:44:13,080 --> 02:44:14,080
Slow.

2446
02:44:15,080 --> 02:44:21,080
See, it was really neat. See, the male turtle is standing up, leaning on the shell of the female turtle, go,

2447
02:44:21,080 --> 02:44:25,080
wump, wump, wump.

2448
02:44:25,080 --> 02:44:27,080
Did he make a wump sound when he did it?

2449
02:44:27,080 --> 02:44:34,080
No, but it was, like, that slow. It was like, one, two.

2450
02:44:34,080 --> 02:44:37,080
It was neat, though, because it was turtle fire.

2451
02:44:37,080 --> 02:44:38,080
Hahaha!

2452
02:44:38,080 --> 02:44:40,080
We played and it went squeal!

2453
02:44:40,080 --> 02:44:42,080
Turtle-fucking-yeah!

2454
02:44:42,080 --> 02:44:44,080
Alright, more questions.

2455
02:44:45,080 --> 02:44:47,080
Alright, Stressa!

2456
02:44:47,080 --> 02:44:49,080
I thought we saw all the lemurs doing it.

2457
02:44:50,080 --> 02:44:53,080
That's not a question. It's an order.

2458
02:44:53,080 --> 02:44:54,080
What?

2459
02:44:54,080 --> 02:44:56,080
Stressa, it's this next drunk show. Let the hot sex begin.

2460
02:44:56,080 --> 02:44:57,080
No!

2461
02:44:57,080 --> 02:44:58,080
No!

2462
02:44:58,080 --> 02:45:00,080
Dan won't be here.

2463
02:45:02,080 --> 02:45:04,080
Go on the ferret!

2464
02:45:04,080 --> 02:45:13,360
23rd Magus wants to know, are y'all happy for us? So happy we could shit. And is he

2465
02:45:13,360 --> 02:45:20,600
getting too sappy today? Is he getting too sappy, you guys think? No. But we're going

2466
02:45:20,600 --> 02:45:29,960
to tease you guys, because we can't. I can't mind the other yo-yo either. I know, all the

2467
02:45:29,960 --> 02:45:34,120
toys disappeared oh there's the yo-yo i see it it's on the ground it's over there all

2468

When you're in love, you'll dance along again

2480
02:47:58,580 --> 02:48:02,580
It's not like I want to leave you here

2481
02:48:02,580 --> 02:48:06,580
And I'll be your one more

2482
02:48:06,580 --> 02:48:09,580
Don't want me to say I love you

2486
02:49:01,840 --> 02:49:09,480

2487
02:50:09,480 --> 02:50:12,480
We gotta get up, don't you think?

2488
02:53:12,480 --> 02:53:24,920
Oh, apps!

2489
02:53:24,920 --> 02:53:28,800
This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

2490
02:53:28,800 --> 02:53:33,840
Hi, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2491
02:53:33,840 --> 02:53:37,440
Look, you wanted to talk about how he's going to be famous.

2492
02:53:37,440 --> 02:54:05,760
The song that we played the last song before we came back was Dancer, which by the way

2493
02:54:05,760 --> 02:54:09,140
is the best 2DX8 style video ever.

2494
02:54:09,140 --> 02:54:13,960
And we were talking during the break about, because some of you out there have been demanding

2495
02:54:13,960 --> 02:54:18,040
that we update our website with our bios, because they haven't been up for a while.

2496
02:54:18,040 --> 02:54:19,840
Loki has never had a bio on the site.

2497
02:54:19,840 --> 02:54:24,840
I'm sorry, I need a picture of me with my real nose and not a photoshopped nose.

2498
02:54:24,840 --> 02:54:28,040
You have to admit though, Glenn did interesting work with those.

2499
02:54:28,040 --> 02:54:29,040
Interesting.

2500
02:54:29,040 --> 02:54:33,760
I didn't look anything like you, excuse me, I don't look like I'm made out of plastic.

2501
02:54:33,760 --> 02:54:35,760
Yeah, they did look like we were made out of plastic.

2502
02:54:35,760 --> 02:54:37,760
And I don't have a Barbra Streisand nose.

2503
02:54:37,760 --> 02:54:38,760
I had a big nose too, hey.

2504
02:54:38,760 --> 02:54:43,760
Well anyway, we're going to take some new pictures of ourselves and we're talking about which 2DX videos we're going to parody to do the pictures of.

2505
02:54:43,760 --> 02:54:46,760
I don't want to parody a 2DX video, I don't play 2DX.

2506
02:54:46,760 --> 02:54:49,760
Well we're just going to dress you up like a pimp because you're the porn king.

2507
02:54:49,760 --> 02:54:51,760
I'm not a porn king, I don't even own that much.

2508
02:54:51,760 --> 02:54:53,760
Shut up, you're the porn king.

2509
02:54:53,760 --> 02:55:00,760
Okay chat room, chat room, how are we dressing, I want chat room to vote then. How are we dressing up Loki for his picture on the bio page?

2510
02:55:00,760 --> 02:55:05,760
We already decided that Jamie is going to do the Dancer scary barbie chick girl.

2511
02:55:05,760 --> 02:55:07,760
That would be funny.

2512
02:55:07,760 --> 02:55:10,760
You could be a cowgirl.

2513
02:55:10,760 --> 02:55:12,760
We'll shave your head in odd ways.

2514
02:55:12,760 --> 02:55:15,760
We're going to set your hair on fire and take a picture.

2515
02:55:15,760 --> 02:55:17,760
No, we're not setting my hair on fire.

2516
02:55:17,760 --> 02:55:20,760
I can wear my tourniquet with my glasses on, whatever.

2517
02:55:20,760 --> 02:55:21,760
We'll see.

2518
02:55:21,760 --> 02:55:22,760
Alright.

2519
02:55:22,760 --> 02:55:23,760
That would actually be from a 2D action video.

2520
02:55:23,760 --> 02:55:25,760
Ah, ah, beautiful, beautiful.

2521
02:55:25,760 --> 02:55:26,760
Snubdisphonoid, got it.

2522
02:55:26,760 --> 02:55:27,760
Stoic.

2523
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:28,760
We're dressing up like the stoic video.

2524
02:55:28,760 --> 02:55:29,760
Yes, alright.

2525
02:55:29,760 --> 02:55:30,760
Thank you.

2526
02:55:30,760 --> 02:55:31,760
Word.

2527
02:55:31,760 --> 02:55:32,760
Winner.

2528
02:55:32,760 --> 02:55:33,760
Thank you guys.

2529
02:55:33,760 --> 02:55:34,760
Alright.

2530
02:55:34,760 --> 02:55:35,760
But don't be offended if I don't drool.

2531
02:55:35,760 --> 02:55:36,760
Stoic it is.

2532
02:55:36,760 --> 02:55:37,760
There you go.

2533
02:55:37,760 --> 02:55:40,040
But we need to actually photoshop in a tran next to him.

2534
02:55:40,040 --> 02:55:41,540
We will.

2535
02:55:41,540 --> 02:55:44,960
And I'm going to dress up as the chick from the last message video.

2536
02:55:44,960 --> 02:55:48,520
It's only fitting since they sit on the ground all the time.

2537
02:55:48,520 --> 02:55:49,520
Yeah, so just sit on the ground all the time.

2538
02:55:49,520 --> 02:55:50,520
Yeah, you're going to do stoic.

2539
02:55:50,520 --> 02:55:51,520
Alright.

2540
02:55:51,520 --> 02:55:52,520
And then I get to be the girl from Dancer.

2541
02:55:52,520 --> 02:55:54,360
I'm going to bring in a Barbie.

2542
02:55:54,360 --> 02:55:57,840
One of my goth-ed out Barbies.

2543
02:55:57,840 --> 02:55:58,840
Right on.

2544
02:55:58,840 --> 02:56:04,840
You know, a little known fact, I used to have a public access show when I was in high school.

2545
02:56:04,840 --> 02:56:06,840
Actually, I think I have mentioned this on a show before.

2546
02:56:06,840 --> 02:56:07,840
I had a public access show when I was in high school.

2547
02:56:07,840 --> 02:56:09,840
We actually did a sketch on the show once.

2548
02:56:09,840 --> 02:56:10,840
It was Industrial Gothic Barbie.

2549
02:56:10,840 --> 02:56:11,840
Cool.

2550
02:56:11,840 --> 02:56:12,840
And we had a little Barbie that we dressed up.

2551
02:56:12,840 --> 02:56:14,840
We had Depeche Mode songs playing loud.

2552
02:56:14,840 --> 02:56:18,840
She came with her own cage and kitty familiar.

2553
02:56:18,840 --> 02:56:22,840
I had this weird phase I went through where I was buying Barbies because I...

2554
02:56:22,840 --> 02:56:25,840
When I was in third grade, I let all my Barbies mold.

2555
02:56:25,840 --> 02:56:27,840
And then I just went off and played with my Transformers.

2556
02:56:27,840 --> 02:56:31,840
and then suddenly I realized that the Barbies that came out for a little while were actually kind of cool,

2557
02:56:31,840 --> 02:56:33,840
except I wanted to alter them.

2558
02:56:35,840 --> 02:56:36,840
And so I did.

2559
02:56:36,840 --> 02:56:37,840
Into what?

2560
02:56:37,840 --> 02:56:39,840
I would actually make their clothes.

2561
02:56:39,840 --> 02:56:40,840
That's cool.

2562
02:56:40,840 --> 02:56:42,840
I'm a little fashion designer. I used to want to be a fashion designer.

2563
02:56:42,840 --> 02:56:44,840
Did you fashion design for G.I. Joe, too?

2564
02:56:44,840 --> 02:56:45,840
No.

2565
02:56:45,840 --> 02:56:46,840
Because he needed it.

2566
02:56:46,840 --> 02:56:49,840
No, because you know what? They never came out with the G.I. Joe that had hair.

2567
02:56:49,840 --> 02:56:50,840
Oh, that's true.

2568
02:56:50,840 --> 02:56:52,840
I wanted Earring Magic Ken, though.

2569
02:56:52,840 --> 02:56:54,840
Because Earring Magic Ken came with a cock ring.

2570
02:56:54,840 --> 02:57:01,840
And the guy admitted that when he designed them, the pen that he wore around his neck

2571
02:57:01,900 --> 02:57:08,020
really was a cock rake. And they took it off the market. I bet if you go to E-May and look

2572
02:57:08,020 --> 02:57:15,020
up earring magic hen, then there are going to be bugs.

2573
02:57:16,160 --> 02:57:20,860
Interesting. Okay. Also, we're going to get around and get everybody's final thoughts

2574
02:57:20,860 --> 02:57:24,660
for the night. But first, I want to say we didn't even talk about this on the show tonight.

2594
02:58:30,020 --> 02:58:34,820
Ah, Black Lab is suggesting we do Bimani predictions for 2003 next week. That's a good one.

2596
02:58:40,140 --> 02:58:46,340
Why are you looking at me when you say that? I don't know. Who's that? You're sexy.

2597
02:58:46,340 --> 02:58:49,500

she has a big black cock going out of her head and she keeps it wrapped up in the turban

02:59:00,540 --> 02:59:02,540

2618
02:59:55,260 --> 02:59:58,720
however uh... tonight i decided i'm gonna interrupt and uh... put in a

2619
02:59:58,720 --> 03:00:02,180
special fortune cookie message uh... it's a little bit

2620
03:00:02,180 --> 03:00:05,880
kind of sentimental it's kind of a dedication because uh... there's

2621
03:00:05,880 --> 03:00:08,240
somebody out there that really

2622
03:00:08,240 --> 03:00:11,180
when i was a child indeed anyway

2623
03:00:11,180 --> 03:00:15,180
What are you guys laughing at? I'm trying to have a serious moment here. You guys suck.

2624
03:00:15,180 --> 03:00:17,180
You guys are playing candy cane games.

2625
03:00:17,180 --> 03:00:21,180
I want to say, no seriously, this is a dedication fortune cookie message.

2626
03:00:21,180 --> 03:00:27,180
When I was a young child, there was somebody I was definitely inspired by that I used to watch every week.

2627
03:00:27,180 --> 03:00:30,180
One of the first shows that I watched all the time.

2628
03:00:30,180 --> 03:00:31,180
I am crying.

2629
03:00:31,180 --> 03:00:37,180
And I was definitely influenced by this person and part of the reason that I think I like to entertain.

2630
03:00:37,180 --> 03:00:39,180
