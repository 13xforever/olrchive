1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,360
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, The Mani Talk, and then some.

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:27,360
Orange Lounge may contain adult content. Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,360
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,360
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,360
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex. In this episode...

7
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,360
Hey, are there any balls down there?

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,360
That's the biggest berry you've ever seen, Jingle Berry.

9
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,360
What's your favorite scary movie?

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,360
Showgirls. Absolute frightful. What's yours?

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,360
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,360
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,360
Now's the time on sprockets and we dance!

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,360
I don't get you, my pretty. And your little dog, too.

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,360
I don't come through.

16
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,360
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,360
Why did they have to take the word gay?

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,360
No! What he expects us to punish him with a shot is Hindu.

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,360
Hey!

20
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,360
Shut up! Where's my gun? This is my boomstick.

21
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,360
Sky. Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb. Loki. I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,360
What kind of war human being would find that funny? Orange Lounge Radio.

23
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:45,360
You are tuned in to the Bamani Scene's most stylish radio station of all things Ben Money.

24
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,360
It's cute and lovely. We are live and this is episode number 27 for January the 5th of 2003.

25
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:58,360
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky. Joining me as always are my awesome, wonderful, stupendous, and bouncy co-hosts.

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,360
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers, also known as Star Trek.

27
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
And that's from hell.

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,360
In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,360
I'm not bouncing. I don't know what the hell you're talking about there.

30
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,360

Alright, we're gonna come back, it's a huge show.

46
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,500
We've got interviews from the, or interview I should say, from the SoCal trip

47
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Loki and I took over the weekend.

48
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
We might do Match Game live in studio tonight.

50
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
And we've got Jamie's Nuts, all after this.

51
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,500
It's the MP3 you've all been coming over from Xtreme.

52
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Or you haven't.

53
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,500
It's the Legend of Max here on Orange Lounge Radio, enjoy!

54
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
Oh

55
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:32,500
1, 2, 3, 2, 1

56
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,000
Ugh.

57
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Hi!

58
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
Oh my God!

59
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
You've got mail!

60
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:50,500
During my service in the United States at the time, I took the initiative in creating

61
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
an internet.

62
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
You bastards!

63
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:00,000
in the United States of Congress, and I put the initiative in creating the Internet.

64
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You bastards!

65
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you?

66
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food truck whopper!

67
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Please, good people, I am in hate.

68
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You are in the dark black forest of Orange Lawn's radio. Here we are.

69
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,040
big fat house tonight filled with people this is crazy

70
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,720
I'm fuzzy and full of nuts

71
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,400
some new promos this week thanks to the lovely DDR Angel and Stressa

72
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,880
you guys made some new promos for us

73
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,240
what was going through your mind when you were making those, why did you decide to make promos

74
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,360
what was up with those, it was just random and hey look

75
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,340
it sounds good, alright sounds good, hi Angel how you doing

76
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,640
no comment

77
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,640
Wait, what was I supposed to say?

78
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:01,640
Alright, first off, as I promised in the chat room, tonight we are bringing back the word of the day.

79
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:07,640
You remember when we did rave and we had the sandstorm? Jamie, tell us all about tonight's word of the day.

80
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:13,640
I think we decided on this one. The word of the day is slut.

81
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
The word of the day is slut.

82
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,640
And whenever we say the word slut, you get this

83
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
The biggest slut in the world, Politary

84
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,640
I don't want to hear Politary over and over and over again

85
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
No

86
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,640
So just don't say slut

87
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,640
Oh, you said slut

88
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:42,640
uh...

89
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,040
baby will kill you

90
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,840
okay shit so now you all know if it is the secret to grow the word of the day

91
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,080
and we're allowed to do that now because the band the years over so the bands

92
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,840
over so we can play a political as much as we want to see what's next new band

93
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,120
you want to be a m

94
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,200
they have all figured out here yay okay voluntary is bad for orange lounge for

95
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,740
another year but i think that they do a thing that will consider

96
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,500
all right

97
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,960
that you've got to say things to do a mike or else they don't hear it on the

98
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,200
radio

99
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,940
by the sharp all right sharp object

100
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,940
word okay so i think when you stick

101
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,200
we need to go back to a time warp here we need to go back to two weeks with

102
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,160
jamie by the way is what you're acting

103
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,300
lovely

104
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,440
lovely job last week i i didn't get any of the whole so i heard that that was

105
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,480
the whole time. I didn't hear that because of all the propelling. You know what? I get

106
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,600
the same problem. When I drink Propel and play DDR, that's like instant pee. I went

107
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,520
through three bottles of Propel that show. Were they all berrylicious? Uh-huh. Alright,

108
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,640
cool. I have nuts stuck in my teeth, sorry. Whoa! Whoa! Me too! How come we haven't heard

109
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,200
from Loki? Where's Loki? Oh, you're right there, okay. That's because I don't have a

110
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,840
chair and I'm sitting on the floor without a mic. I thought you liked getting to pet

111
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:06,980
the rug here. That's a wrong rug, I think. Don't you like petting rug? Uh, yes. Okay.

112
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,740
Are you a rug munchkin? We need to time warp back to two weeks ago. We did the last show.

113
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,220
Only on the weekends. Oh, then up came the weekend. Loki and I, we took a little road

114
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:25,940
trip. We went down to SoCal. Bit or a table of one? Bitches. We went down to SoCal and

115
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,140
we were there and we have a little summary of it. Right? We're going to play this bit?

116
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:34,660
Yeah. Alright, let's see. Let's see if this works here. Our live piece. Well, not our

117
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,900
live piece, but our somewhat live piece. A week delayed.

118
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,100
I don't want to know about your piece. I'm going to go back to eating my nuts.

119
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,900
Anyway, enjoy this bit from SoCal. I can never reach.

120
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:50,300
First here on Orange Lawns Radio. So here it is, the taped garbage part of the

121
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:56,760
show. As you may or may not know, last week, Loki and I decided to take a little trip,

122
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,900
and we decided to visit Southern California. And with me here, of course, is Loki. Say

123
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,900
hello.

124
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,900
Hey, everybody.

125
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:08,300
Now, describe for us, Matt, since I'm not a very good speaker, what kind of place are

126
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,300
we at right now?

127
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:16,620
We're in the giant mall that I wish we had. Yes, we are so very unprivileged up in NorCal.

128
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:23,500
This mall is just huge, and there's giant lights in the sky, neon lights everywhere, it is paradise, definitely.

129
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:29,680
And they got lots of shops, and they have a frickin' anime shop! Why don't we have a frickin' anime shop up in Norical? That sucks.

130
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,720
And they have a Dave & Buster's. That's pretty cool.

131
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,740
Yes, overpriced games. Woo-hoo, but they had a...

132
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,680
What was that derby game?

133
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,340
Derby Owner's Club.

134
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,500
The hot new Milpitas game.

135
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,620
It was fun. I jacked someone's horse, so that was kinda cool.

136
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,000
horse breeders don't my horse

137
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,640
come back here with my horse wilbur

138
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,400
so that kind of fun

139
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,720
and then we just saw a guy another day which was uh...

140
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,120
a giant penis

141
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,340
but before they had even worse i can uh...

142
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,360
previous of like movies they're just gonna really suck ass

143
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,240
movie started at two the actual film started at two thirty

144
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,600
let's put it that way

145
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,120
awful awful

146
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,880
sort of the kind of crap we've done this weekend we've we've been we've seen all

147
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,220
the sites. We went to Cyberzone yesterday. We went to Arcade Infinity last night. What

148
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,480
other kind of junk have we done here? I went to Japan Arcade. Got to play Beam the

149
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,900

150
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:34,760

152
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:55,120

00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,960
You can watch such fine films as Blue Crush

180
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,320
and Undercover Brother.

181
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,840
Amazing films there.

182
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:44,240
Yes, I'm sorry. Remember, you only need one hand to use a DVD remote.

183
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,060
Terp, terp, blink, blink.

184
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,680
If you got porn.

185
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,200
Ha! Jokes on you, it was VHS porn.

186
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,200
You still only need one hand to use a VHS remote!

187
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Back to the tape.

188
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Can't wait!

189
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Alright, so, you know, here it is, your chance, you finally get to be on the show.

190
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
What kinds of things do you have to say for the listeners?

191
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,200
Um, nothing much, actually.

192
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Well, you sure talk a lot in the chat room, and now that you have your chance, you don't have anything to say now?

193
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,200
Or should I say, and you don't have anything to say now?

194
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
No, I don't.

195
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,200
You don't talk that way in real life, by the way. You promised me you would and you don't.

196
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,140
you don't I don't talk much in real life amazing most people you meet from the

197
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:34,980
DDR community don't talk much all I hardly ever talk much and let me I don't

198
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:40,260
talk much I don't know when we got the plate max to in the middle of a theater

199
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,420
and watch people go what are you doing what they step in on the Aerosport how

200
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:50,300
do you do that I have that brings me back to the stupid people that seen up

201
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,300
Mr. Spanky took it and shoved it up his a**.

202
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:29,300
However, if I can't find it, I can give you a PS1 keychain clip pen.

203
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,300
Okay, we'll just get back to the tape.

204
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
Okay.

205
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,300
And in case she didn't say what I think she said, she's gonna say,

206
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,300
Um, you haven't emailed me the proof yet.

207
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,300
That's right, now where is this proof that she speaketh of?

208
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,300
Um, I lost my Dextra, I'm sorry.

209
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,300
Oh, well, I think she lost her GameCube pen. What do you have to say about that?

210
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,300
Hey, I was right!

211
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,300
So, let's see, what else can we

212
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,300
talk about here in the little SoCal segment? What are we going to do with the rest of the time

213
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,300
here in SoCal? Well, one thing we're going to do tomorrow is check out AI

214
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,300
because it's rumored that they're going to get DDR Extreme there, so hopefully they will.

215
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:16,300
We got to see the crazy whore. It was rumored that what was in Cyberzone

216
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:26,540
going to get it yesterday and obviously it wasn't. Omaha, Nebraska. Freaking Omaha, dude.

217
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:32,780
If I ever have a band, I'm naming it Freaking Omaha. Instead of Max II and the Aussie Landers,

218
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:42,500
this time we got Xtreme and the Rednecks. Yeehaw. I'm just not very happy with that.

219
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Hey, we got our 2DX machine when we come back, so that's kind of cool.

220
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,500
And there was a fellow from Omaha that came out to Shaft, so you know, he wasn't right

221
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,500
neck at all, he was a very cool guy, so I'm happy for the, I'm happy yet insane with jealousy

222
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
for those folks in Omaha, what can you say?

223
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
Not anymore.

224
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,500
And I got to see definitely a bunch of cool stuff, you know, that one mall we went to

225
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:09,500
was pretty sweet in Little Tokyo, and I got to spend money, and I bought models and cool

226
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,500
stuff.

227
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,500
Cool. Any words of advice for things we should do while we're in SoCal or the places we should go?

228
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,500
You are the resident expert right now, at least out of the three of us.

229
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,500
This isn't the biggest mall. You still haven't been to some of the biggest malls we have around here.

230
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,500
You should go to The Block. You should honestly go to The Block. That place is huge.

231
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Okay, but what other mall has a giant glowing phallic symbol?

232
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,500
I don't know.

233
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,640
there's this giant glowing green thing and oh my god now it's red and it glows

234
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,760
and it looks like and look at the little tip it's even got a little tip and I

235
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,720
took some pictures though while we were down here oh I gotta mention this really

236
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:54,560
cool game I played yesterday okay this game involves a monkey running around on

237
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,560
a grid undressing a woman I know how weird that sounds that was a bucket

238
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,200
But it was so addicting, it was better in DDR.

239
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,880
Anyway, it was really cool, it was a lot of fun.

240
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,360
And afterwards, you get 15 seconds to zoom in and Google

241
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,360
the woman.

242
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,240
Yeah, fun.

243
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,960
All right, we better wrap up this segment

244
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,440
and get back to the real show.

245
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,240
But we have to ask SoCalKicks, because we always

246
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,480
ask the hosts of the show whenever it's over.

247
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,000
We always go around the three of us,

248
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,160
and we always say our final thoughts of the day,

249
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,440
and any guests that happen to be in the studio.

250
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,360
So I'm just going to ask SoCalKicks, what are your final thoughts of the day?

251
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,360
Loki gives the best hookups.

252
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,160
He also gives the best... Never mind, we're going to go back to the show now. Good night!

253
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,120
No, wait! Hey, hey!

254
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,720
Alright, one, two, three, four!

255
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Alright.

256
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,760
I think I said something like, uh, no, I do not! I don't know what you're talking about!

257
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,320
That is wrong and very disgusting.

258
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,280
And you enjoy it.

259
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,840
Uh, big thank you to our buddy SoCalKicks for spending some time with us.

260
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,440
Let me proof you get a pen.

261
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,440
If you really want a pen now, I can send you a Bic.

262
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,720
A Bic?

263
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,320
Yeah, buy a box of Bic. You're gonna flick your Bic?

264
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,240
I'm gonna flick my Bic. Dude, Brad's pen glows.

265
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,960
It's a Rayvar pen.

266
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,560
Ooh, I wanna take E and make out with everybody.

267
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,400
Brad!

268
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:25,200
Don't you be turning into a slut on me!

269
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
I said slugs.

270
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
You said it on purpose.

271
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Nobody heard it.

272
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
Alright.

273
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:37,760
So, then also, what happened when Loki and I were gone, that Friday is when, here in

274
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,920
Orange Lounge World Headquarters in Sacramento, finally, 2DX8 style lands here in Sacramento.

275
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,280
I know you guys talked about this on the show last week, so I won't go too far into it,

276
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,800
but 8 styles here, it rules, the end.

277
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:58,120
This week, Xtreme started spreading like a bad case of VD all around California.

278
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,160
And it made its way to Stockton last night, so we took a trip down to Stockton Golf Land,

279
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,720
as I call it for short, GAG, Ghetto Ass Golf Land.

280
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,520
And we went down to GAG to play DDRXtreme.

281
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:17,520
So five of us went, the three of us hosts, and Angel's Trace all went.

282
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,520
What do you want to say about, specifically what do you want to say about DDRXtreme?

283
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,520
Because I know there's lots of people listening going,

284
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,520
It's extreme!

285
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,520
I don't know, I felt that Frozen Ray was me.

286
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,520
Shame on Goughland for getting a bootleg! Bad bad!

287
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,520
They had the most ghetto marking.

288
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,520
They took the DDR, um, the 7th mix sign that was up there,

289
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
and they put a big sign over that said,

290
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,520
Extreme DDR 8th!

291
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
8th mix, because they're stupid.

292
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
Stupid people.

293
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,520
I wish it had said a turd mix. I would have paid so much money for it.

294
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,520
I'll make one for him.

295
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,520
So what do you guys think? What did you guys think of Max 2?

296
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,520
Ah, fuck DDR. What did you think of

297
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,520
Extreme in comparison to Max 2?

298
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,520
It's Max 2 Plus. That's exactly what I thought. It's just

299
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,520
DDR Max 2 Plus. Uh, no?

300
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:21,520
Um, let's see. There's a few things, uh, a few things I was disappointed on is the Oni remixes that they had in Max 2 that were supposed to be playable now.

301
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:30,520
They only had one set of steps, and that was the Oni steps. So, ooh, thanks for going all the way and, uh, giving us, you know, new steps for those.

302
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:36,520
Um, some of the new songs I just didn't really care for. There was a really cool pop music one that was like-

303
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:43,620
in a bag. You know what? I didn't see, except for you, Rob. No one else played that fucking

304
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,840
song. I wanted to do something fucked up my last stage, so I'm like, I'll do the big hot

305
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,760
air song. No one played that song. Actually, I was looking at the top three songs for 321

306
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:02,580
Stars, Vanity Angel, surprise, and Tears. Those are the only. Now that was the thing

307
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:08,060
I liked about extreme is that the videos they keep getting better the video for stoic was pretty funny because it's just like the 2d

308
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,060
X1 except as the afro guy doing it and

309
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,060
They said the video. What were some other songs? I actually played

310
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:18,820
I did the I do I do I do and it had this whole little like retro thing going on with all these little pictures

311
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,820
of hot little Asian girls and

312
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:27,140
Speed over Beethoven at Beethoven running all around all this other best video one of the best videos has to be for legend of

313
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,900
Max with the guys running in the background shit like that. I was off. Oh my god

314
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,900
No, I liked the one for Jet World.

315
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,900
That was cool.

316
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,900
I wish they had the singing ladies with the humongous heads.

317
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,900
That was beautiful, Jamie.

318
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,900
Talk about non-core.

319
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,900
Personally, in my opinion, Extreme was just, yeah.

320
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,900
Extreme was little.

321
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,900
Yeah, that too.

322
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,900
It just, it's with more shit.

323
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:00,580
I I just it's hard for me to get excited about extreme. There's nothing that

324
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,280
Exciting in it who somebody's making this room a disco over here with lights

325
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,760
How about eight style? Yeah, whoo

326
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,540
Yeah, eight styles much cooler. Yeah, I wish though

327
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,020
I remember way back when they showed that there was like a joke picture

328
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,220
That someone had made like a giant 2d x-pad to play with their feet

329
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,960
They should do like one of those

330
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:31,960
To hell with all you and your stupid 2DX. 2DX sucks ass. All of you suck ass.

331
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,960
Thank you, shut up.

332
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,960
Super strong, no less.

333
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,960
All I know about Xtreme is it's just a green Max 2.

334
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Yeah, it's a green Max 2 with twice as many songs, with more modes, and more options, and more difficulty.

335
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,480
It's just the same damn game. Hey, it's actually it's the first base with 230 songs in it. Yeah

336
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,020
They'll all get played out. Wait call it beat mania because that's what it really is. It's just beat mania, right?

337
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:04,860
No, it's beat mania. It's beat mania. I don't know. It looks like Street Fighter. You know, it's got pixels

338
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,840
It's on a monitor you push buttons. It's all the same, you know now granted

339
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,920
I haven't played extreme yet, but how can everyone got all excited?

340
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,360
you know to go from third style to our third mix to fourth mix and all it was

341
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,160
was just you know added songs and stuff you know they changed a few things here

342
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,440
and there you know but when it goes from max to extreme everyone's just like

343
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,720
we're jaded you know yeah maybe that's it I don't know but we didn't like the

344
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,160
CD banners okay no one liked the discard no one really cared here's a here's a

345
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,160
You know what I like?

346
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,160
Puke it up.

347
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:46,160
What I did like is that they had the song list, you could divide it by game, that it

348
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,160
came from.

349
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:52,120
Yeah, see, I know, I mean, like, see, I hear that Extreme has a few new options too and

350
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,000
stuff, but I don't know, like, it seems like everyone got all excited from, you know, transition

351
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,160
from third to fourth, but not from, you know, seventh to eighth, or, you know, I don't know.

352
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,160
Anyway, yeah.

353
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:09,160
I mean, it's okay just to have, like, new stuff to kind of break the monotony of Max 2 because I can only stand to hear the whistle song so many times, you know?

354
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,160
It's gone. It's gone.

355
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,160
And it's gone.

356
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,160
Well, thank you.

357
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,160
It might be an unlock, but it's good.

358
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,160
Whatever. Whatever.

359
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:22,160
It's kind of nice just to have some new songs kind of mixed up a little. Like I said, the videos are nice, so it's pretty to watch, but...

360
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,160
I didn't see ghosts come back.

361
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
No, ghosts did not come back. I didn't see either.

362
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,160
That pisses me the fuck off. Because I liked playing ghosts.

363
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:34,480
telephone operator did come back that was pretty cool so anyway and I saw

364
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,780
somebody there playing freckles just so they could get extra stage I'm like

365
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:45,000
Jesus okay you're playing it to get an extra stage yet you're wasting a stage

366
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,480
to get that extra stage what's up with that well then fuck that it's kind of

367
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,920
weird though because it's now the extra stage you can pick any song you watch

368
00:26:53,920 --> 00:27:05,060
this on reverse 1-5 with butterfly extra stage. That is pretty cool. And heavy. I'd have to

369
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:10,320
say that, Para Nera Survivor, that was hard. That was fun. I only got about halfway through

370
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:16,980
on doubles. I owned A on the Oni. I double A'd A. Yeah, you double A'd A on heavy on

371
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:24,980
On Singles the first time, I passed A on the ONI steps, which are our cata on doubles,

372
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,820
and that was fun.

373
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:33,980
And Trip Machine Survivor's Easy as Hell, it's a weird fucking song, weird, weird song.

374
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:38,060
What was that one song, Guacamole?

375
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,900
Gum Land, A Couple.

376
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,820
That song pissed me off, but I was more pissed off because of the situation, everything was

377
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,700
against me.

378
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:52,700
It had a really crazy-ass cactus in the background.

379
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,700
Yeah, it was pretty cool. The cactus playing Samba was pretty cool.

380
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,700
Like I said, the videos are great. The videos keep getting better and better.

381
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:07,700
The best fucking background in a DDR game ever has to be A. A has the most kick-ass background image for it.

382
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,700
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

383
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,700
Chat room's asking, what about V? V's video.

384
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,700
I really dug the splash screen for V.

385
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:22,460
There's Tron walking down the stairs with her all shadowed out with the blue light from

386
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,460
behind.

387
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,460
I don't remember the video itself though.

388
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,760
I think it's just one of those generic rave videos.

389
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,820
Generic random shit.

390
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,180
That's pretty much it.

391
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,440
So there wasn't any special video for that.

392
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,200
I think A didn't have a special video either.

393
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,260
I remember it just had the dude, the Renaissance guy.

394
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,260
Yeah.

395
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,620
Alright, so that's all of our thoughts on Xtreme, anything else?

396
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,620
Yeah!

397
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,620
Angel, you're so quiet over there.

398
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,400
You have anything you want to say about Xtreme?

399
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,960
No, just no.

400
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,960
We're eating death cookies.

401
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,960
Okay!

402
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,960
Murder never tasted better.

403
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,960
They had this really cool Japanese heavy metal song that was in there.

404
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,960
It had this character from Poppy Music in the background dressed up like a samurai.

405
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,960
He looked really evil looking.

406
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,960
So that was kind of cool.

407
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,960
They had that in there.

408
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,960
It was a really awesome heavy metal song.

409
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:19,040
though. The guy that was playing it was really cool at freestyling, too, so that was kind

410
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,960
of cool to watch.

411
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,800
All right, so I think at this point in the show we're going to take a quick break. Sound

412
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,960
good to you? Anything else you want to say on Extreme, Jamie?

413
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,440
Why is that pizza? Yeah, we've got to go get that.

414
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,560
It was extremely, um, yeah.

415
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,340
No, I wouldn't say it's a waste. I wouldn't by any means say it's a waste. It's a badly

416
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:42,720
needed upgrade to Max 2, but it doesn't bring anything new into DDR.

417
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,880
That's so completely average.

418
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:51,880
They didn't put any of the cooler songs from 2DX in. That kind of pisses me off.

419
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,160
Some of them.

420
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,640
A is kind of fun to dance to, but I mean, it's just, it's steps were a little easy.

421
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,560
Although I hear the only ones are harder.

422
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,560
I only played two games. But now I have a decent selection of Tac songs.

423
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,000
They should have put it in Cracker.

424
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,400
Yes!

425
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,440
Tears?

426
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,760
Sucked ass.

427
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,900
Hyper-Eurobeat? I wasn't touching that with a ten foot pole.

428
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,700
and bring the age of those that suck ass

429
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:20,780
thank you much it speed over beethoven was as fun as people so lots of tax

430
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,780
the tax cool

431
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,080
stoker

432
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,340
uh... one of the songs was name the end

433
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,200
what feature

434
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,420
what's your idea

435
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:40,420
i hate that's what

436
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:48,040
and i say someone economically every minute until they bring back the whistle

437
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,440
song

438
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,880
when was the show and i hope they never bring that back that's my least favorite

439
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,460
tdr song

440
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,460
has been the school quality

441
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,060
okay we're gonna take a quick break and still is funny when we mentioned miss

442
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:06,820
Is Muffet getting AIDS?

443
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,820
We're going to come back...

444
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:11,060
No, I thought that your hooker story was pretty funny.

445
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:15,540
We're going to come back and do the FUs of the week, so send those to me over in the

446
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,180
chat room, and dear God, we've got a lot of people to get through tonight, so make them

447
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,180
short!

448
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,860
Alright, we'll be back after a quick break featuring those two little letters you all

449
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,860
love.

450
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:38,580
so

451
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:35,180
Hello? Hello, is this thing on testing? Testing 1-2?

452
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:39,220
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

453
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:43,220
Hello? I don't understand this. Does this thing work?

454
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,620
This thing reads like stereo instructions! Is this on?

455
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:51,900
What the hell? Orange Lounge Radio. Broke-down ghetto Bimani

456
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:58,860
radio. What the ****? Yes, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. By the way, the beep

457
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:06,860
was really ****. Thank you, thank you for sharing that. Alright, we are back and we're

458
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,900
going to get right into it, the FUs of the week. Now we have a lot of new, it's a new

459
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,700

00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:25,980

462
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:34,500
eating pizza in front of you? Blind much? Jamie's sitting here going, nah, nah, I love

463
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:41,500
pizza. Strisa's got pizza sitting in his freaking hand. Is the pizza here yet? Oh my god. I

464
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:47,100
thought they were supposed to deliver the pizza five minutes ago. Poor Loki. They did.

465
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,100
What are we paying this guy for?

466
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,100
We're not.

467
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:56,100
He gives good handjumps. No, I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. God, I'm kidding.

468
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,100
Oh, somebody said the S word.

469
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,100
All right, all right. Talk about the FUs of the week, please.

470
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,100
Pretty please, Jamie. Tell us all about it.

471
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,100
Fuck a duck screw a kangaroo.

472
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:21,100
It's going to be one of those shows. It is one of those shows.

473
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:26,100
I don't know.

474
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:32,100
The five cases a week are when we get pissy and say, fuck you.

475
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:38,100
See, Rob likes to censor and go, F, not me. I don't care about watching my fucking language.

476
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,100
So, fuck.

477
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:47,100
Okay, if the two minutes off my life thing were true for everything, I would be burning in hell right now.

478
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:51,100
But remember, I have to take over hell.

479
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,100
Ah, yes.

480
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,100
Alright, so we're ready to do these FUs of the Week.

481
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,100
My kunitori of hell.

482
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,100
Did you say your kuditori of hell?

483
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,100
People who watched Udoni Kenshin would get it.

484
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,100
Oh, okay.

485
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:06,100
Alright, here we go, the FUs of the Week, starting off with the FU goddess that we always start off with.

486
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,100
Fuck, say it, Rob. Say it.

487
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:15,100
It's the FUCK SHIT COCK HORSE PISS CUNT USED OF THE WEEK.

488
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:20,140
My first fuck you of the week goes to my shoes.

489
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,700
People who have seen me know about my burning feet.

490
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,180
I have the coolest pair of shoes in the universe. You might want to see a doctor about that.

491
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,660
Bite my ass.

492
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,900
I bought these shoes two and a half months ago from the Vans Outlet.

493
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,380
And the last pair of shoes I got from the Vans Outlet lasted me a year and a half.

494
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,540
These are starting to really kill my feet. Before I got my pair of shoes before these,

495
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:44,020
I was having really bad problems with the arches and the old shoes.

496
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:48,980
I couldn't play DDR without having my arches hurt and having my feet just be really painful.

497
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,180
Well, these shoes

498
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:55,380
are starting to do it to me, and I've only had two and a half months that I've been wearing them.

499
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,080
So, fuck my burning feet.

500
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,780
They might like it.

501
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,460
Shut up, Rob.

502
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,020
Next thing.

503
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:07,060
but starting off went back to my career

504
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:11,200
because they have this and now on top of the on top of the machine

505
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,400
and cancer nice and good anything

506
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,080
if it's not going to your eyes when you're trying to play a song for the

507
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,120
first time

508
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,380
absolutely

509
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:21,660
welcome all of the couple

510
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,300
family and a couple family

511
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,940
i think the mob on songs that the god damn mobile song

512
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,400
luckily

513
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,260
anyway

514
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,980
this is the way it was going like doesn't matter if those like tearing up

515
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,780
the whole time so i think you play

516
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,980
but i think we're hurting questions

517
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,660
and then i think it was an issue

518
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,940
appealing up so they like

519
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:47,180
runs into the ball of my feet and the ball

520
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,540
and then

521
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:53,420
but i think that's because i have to be lucky for all of my clothes

522
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,340
because all of them acting

523
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,540
i think my room

524
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,780
he got about twenty hours

525
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,820
i think my room

526
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,260
I have done two loads of wash.

527
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,160
I have about maybe ten more to go.

528
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,380
I didn't realize my wardrobe was so huge.

529
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,060
The other thing, fuck my new pair of jeans.

530
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:20,220
Because they were falsely made and now I can't return them because I've already worn them.

531
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,060
In the rain. Fuck the rain.

532
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,660
Because it's not.

533
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,200
And fuck your Yankee blue jeans.

534
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,660
Bravo. Thank you.

535
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,620
that it

536
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,580
moving on to look is if i have to ask i don't know as if i have to ask what is

537
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,260
that the other week is a terrible okie

538
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,780
well start off with the most recent thank you for not telling me there's

539
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,860
pizza here

540
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,420
how much is the observant when there's so much shit going on

541
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,580
i'm hungry

542
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,100
i'm seeing i'll

543
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:54,620
i mean strippers

544
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,940
anyway

545
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,620
I thought you said that your list of priorities put food above strippers.

546
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,720
It did.

547
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,500
Well, my food's almost gone, see?

548
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,940
There's a really huge F.U., and that goes to drivers, again.

549
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,700
Akine.

550
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,340
I'm gonna kill you.

551
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,260
You freaking get near me!

552
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,460
Seriously!

553
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,940
Stop trying to cut me off! If you're skipping to the old Asian bitch, stop changing lanes!

554
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,740
For no apparent reason!

555
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,120
I don't give a shit if you don't know where you're going!

556
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,720
Don't get in my way!

557
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:33,000
F you to stupid driver's ed people! You're driving 40 miles under the speed limit

558
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,040
and you piss me off! I don't care if you know how to drive because you're never going to learn how to drive

559
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,680
C point A!

560
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,540
Okay?

561
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,160
Also!

562
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,080
F you to freaking golf lands!

563
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,000
They suck ass!

564
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Okay, stocking golf lands alright but their carpet sucks shit.

565
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,280
roseville golf land

566
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,040
well you kind of have to have drumsticks play drum mania

567
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,480
that's kind of the point of the game

568
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,360
bang the sticks against the drums that's how it works

569
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,600
uh... although they'll go down in here

570
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,000
they have created

571
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,920
if you hear extreme

572
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,180
for one reason

573
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,080
michael but they've been

574
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:19,480
NO ONE SHOULD PUT A RICKY MARTIN COVER IN ANY FUCKING DDR MIX!

575
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,680
That's it, for now.

576
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,720
It works for somebody, amigo.

577
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,980
Oh fuck that!

578
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,360
Matt has a mouth full of anyway, going back to...

579
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,240
Jamie, Jamie's had a relapse. Yes.

580
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,200
Back to the Golf Land thing.

581
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:43,520
Fuck those idiots last night, I had your asses kicked out and that was cool.

582
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,000
Alright, uh, my turn.

583
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,500
Are you sure?

584
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,000
Yes.

585
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
My FU of the Week. I would additionally like to give an FU of the Week to drivers.

586
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,500
Yeah, fuck you.

587
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:59,000
If you were driving on I-5 North about last Sunday night, about, oh, I don't know, anytime between noon and nine, because that's how long we were on the goddamn road.

588
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,000
If you were driving on that road, fuck you. I hate you. Burn in hell for all eternity because you don't know how to fucking drive.

589
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Loki had enough road rage for the both of us, at least.

590
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,120
I was driving it. He was yelling at everything. It helped pass the time. What can you say?

591
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,240
My other F.U. goes to work. I don't want to go back tomorrow. Fuck work.

592
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,000
What other F.U.s do I have? I guess that's it.

593
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,000
That's it. That's all the F.U.s I can think of for right now. So fuck, fuck Stockton Golf Line for being ghetto.

594
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,280
Oh, fuck people that don't know how to follow a token line. Fuck the token line. Just fuck the token line all together.

595
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,680
I can't fucking stand the token line because nobody ever knows how to follow the token line because

596
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,880
Nobody is smart that plays DDR, apparently.

597
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,980
Listen crazy bitch, you don't fucking put 12 tokens on the goddamn line!

598
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,980
One at a time, you dumbass!

599
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,980
I'm gonna be playing a lot!

600
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,980
Fuck that bitch who puts 12 tokens on the machine and says,

601
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,980
you say, you're only supposed to put one up.

602
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,980
Oh, I'm gonna be playing a lot.

603
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:57,980
Fuck you!

604
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:00,980
You're gonna be playing none at all when I have my foot so far up your fucking ass

605
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,980
you won't be able to walk straight for a week.

606
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:08,980
No, you showed the pit so far up her ass that she tastes rubber.

607
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:14,980
Anyway, um, yeah, so fuck the token line.

608
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,980
Good thing I didn't see her.

609
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:20,980
Because nobody knows how to follow it. Try a sign-up sheet. It takes a pen and a piece of paper.

610
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:25,980
And, um, and again, if you steal a pen, you're fucking sad.

611
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:30,980
If you have to steal a goddamn fifty cent thick pen, your life is really fucking sad.

612
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,980
I hope you die. I hope you die of syphilis.

613
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:36,980
And F you to that stupid flamboyant retard who is playing Para Para.

614
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,980
I understand that Para Para is a game for women,

615
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,980
but fucking, seriously, you're way too-

616
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:44,980
Oh, yes! And F you to people who play Bimani games that look gayer than me.

617
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,980
Nobody is gayer than me! Nobody!

618
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,980
That was just- it was just so weird.

619
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,980
It- it- it's just- but this guy was more flamboyant than...

620
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:58,980
Oh my god.

621
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:04,980
Liberace! This guy was more flamboyant than fucking Elton John!

622
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:09,980
He must have been the most flamboyant person on the known...

623
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,980
He scares me! Scares me!

624
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,980
I have video of it, though. It will be going up on my website.

625
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:18,980
Yeah, we're going to be making flamingpara.com

626
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,980
I'm done.

627
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,980
I got really ranty this week. That was amazing.

628
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,980

629
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,280

My music again, please.

640
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,700
Okay.

641
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:05,700
Fuck my Trueno in Initial D. I love the car to death, but it has no acceleration, so I

642
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:06,700
made a new car.

643
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,700
I have an Integra Type R now and it's named as Magic.

644
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:10,700
That's all.

645
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,700
Okay, I have another ramp.

646
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:12,700
Oh, God.

647
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,060
With the exception of Jamie, fuck Initial D players.

648
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,900
You all drive the same goddamn car.

649
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:21,340
I saw seven of you coming out of the Golf Lamb parking lot, all with cheap-ass plastic

650
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,780
spoilers on your little rice rockets.

651
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,780
No, no, no, no.

652
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:24,780
The erector set spoilers.

653
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,100
Yes, the erector set spoilers.

654
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,780
God, you people are sad.

655
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,220
Initial D is not real life.

656
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,260
Remember folks, you're driving a Civic, not a race car.

657
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,260
God.

658
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,260
Stickers, do not make it go faster.

659
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:46,180
Ooh, I put the Type R sticker on my, my, uh, Toyota, um, excuse me, there's no, any, no

660
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,180
Toyota car.

661
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,980
Your car is sad, and so are you.

662
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,660
You can't drift on Highway 80.

663
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:51,660
Get over it.

664
00:48:51,660 --> 00:49:00,040
Oh, that doesn't stop me from getting my actual Corolla, 86 Corolla hatchback to modify into

665
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,040
the Torino Sprinter with me on the paint, because, uh...

666
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,040
No, I'm just kidding.

667
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,040
But Jamie's cool like that.

668
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,040
She's okay.

669
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,040
She's the exception to the roll.

670
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,940
I think the whole reason I would have a Ricey car is because I think they're funny.

671
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,860
Jamie can appreciate the comic value of a funny car.

672
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:13,860
I think they're funny.

673
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:19,260
I want to get, like, an 85 Mustang GT and, and, and, like, Rice's...

674
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:27,640
an FU to the stupid bitch at Rayleigh's the Chinese food takeout place listen

675
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,380

676
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,940

677
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:39,340

678
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:50,140
Chinese bitch. I'm done. Wow. Okay. Oh, back to the FUs. Let's go around the room. Are

680
00:49:55,300 --> 00:50:01,820
me a dollar. Alright. Here we go. Going around the room. This is the song I chose for all

681
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:38,820
First of all, F.U. is a butterfly upswing mix. I pick it by accident, then I accidentally

682
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:52,060
put it on maniac. What the hell? I wasn't in the mood for a cata. I got four cata's

683
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:59,300
on my belt. I accidentally put on a cata. Auto fail within, I don't know, 30 seconds.

684
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,800
thirty seconds

685
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,940
waste my entire

686
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,940
fifty seconds

687
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,900
eight

688
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,820
still

689
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:20,300
butterfly upswing mix okay

690
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,220
all righty

691
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:26,300
a page from the book of rob

692
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,300
p0k3smot42o0

693
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,300
p0k3smot42o0

694
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:32,300
Oh, you made me forget what I was going to say!

695
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,300
Angel, you got any FUs of the Week?

696
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,300
I had one, but he took it.

697
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,300
You want me to go with somebody else and come back?

698
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,300
Yeah, sure.

699
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,300
Alright, Stressa, give me your FUs of the Week.

700
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,300
Wow, interesting list for me today.

701
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,300
Which kind of goes against the usual.

702
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:50,300
First and foremost, the parents still need a serious...

703
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:56,300
Well, I'll let you fill it in however you like, okay?

704
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:06,300
My mom is still pissing me off to no end. My dad, well, he still needs a lesson in pulling his head out of his ass, but that's a side issue.

705
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:18,300
I want to send out an F.U. to my ex. She's been totally pissing me off lately. She sent me this Dear John-like email and hasn't said a word to me since.

706
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:29,540
well what the hell next on the list what life and the general ideals that some

707
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:40,700
people they've got all their I see shit they don't like giving people well you

708
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:45,700
You know what? Big steel dildo for you. Right up the ass.

709
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,700
Got that. That's the impression he and I didn't want to think of.

710
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,700
Anyways, I think I'm about done.

711
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,700
All right. Allergies must die.

712
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,700
We ready for Angel? Did you remember?

713
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:13,700
Alright, go to Loki, because he thought of another one.

714
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,700
Um, this is just a really short one, unlike the other ones.

715
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:22,700
F you to the Ralphs that we went to last night, because they were out of three important things.

716
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,700
One, large boxes of Bagel Bites.

717
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,700
Two, Maxim Magazine.

718
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,700
And three, PSM.

719
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,700
All the things I wanted from the Ralphs that they didn't have, so F you to the Ralphs.

720
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:33,700
That's it.

721
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:41,540
In favor of the Ralph's they have some money they have some money and chocolate whipped cream. Yes, ready with chocolate ready with chocolate with it

722
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:46,540
All right, I'm gonna run through the chat room FUs. We'll come back to angels. She thinks they're hers. Okay

723
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,540
On with the chat room FUs

724
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:53,440
It's really a F you to having to come home on my birthday and missing orange lounge that day

725
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:56,380
well, that's okay because we do rebroadcast every Monday night and

726
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,540
Supposedly that I heard a rumor we do them on Thursday afternoons to when it actually works

727
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:04,740
But it hasn't for like the past month, so it's always been like 15 minutes late or some shit

728
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:10,540
So Thursdays at 2 we try to do them, but Mondays at 7 it always happens, so you can always catch up on orange limes that way

729
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:16,160
Black web fuck power outages one messed up on my clocks last night fuck my video card

730
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,900
I can play online games at the best pings

731
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:22,340
But the shittiest frame rates Loki you better keep your mouth shut on that fuck the timing about my car

732
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:26,460
It needs to be replaced and will cost near $800 that kept me from rearing my car up to Davis this quarter

733
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:32,460
Oh yeah, and fuck the city of Davis, too. Fuck the owner of TapX that refuses, and it got cut off.

734
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:36,460
Silly Mac. I'm guessing he refuses to turn up Macs or something like that.

735
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:40,460
And, uh, yeah, he's reminding me I need to make an announcement, which I will do.

736
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:43,460
And, um...

737
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,460

Sorry? Is there, there might be some over there.

745
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,820
See if there's a push pin over on Brian's desk.

746
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:22,820
Underneath the cookies of doom or in the little jar.

747
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,820
See if there's, see if there's some push pins over there.

Wait, he said garbage.

751
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:35,820
I don't count people saying it in chat room. I don't count people saying it.

752
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:38,820
I don't count it when people say slut in the chat room.

753
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:51,020
I just spent an awesome 27 hours with my best friend Owen, and also fuck school tomorrow

754
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:55,180

Fuck people who are happy!

756
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,700

Okay. Angel, did she get yours? Oh, yes she did. Okay, here we go.

772
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:39,800

Yes, and fuck my boss for trying to kill me with Pepper!

Tried to kill you with Pepper? How is that possible?

776
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,800
She was making sandwiches, and I was bending down to get the tomatoes out of the cooler, and

777
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:59,800
yeah, um, Pepper got in my nose. You bastard.

778
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:03,800
Does Brad have any FUs in the week?

786
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:35,420
Alright.

787
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:42,220
Those are the lovely FUs of the week. They suck because they broke Speed Demon and wouldn't fix it, those bastards.

788
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:46,420
Everything else is broken there, why not? Slinky says FU to people who jam seven quarters

789
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:49,620
and break the coin slot for Max 2. That does suck.

790
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:53,340
That's like the girl putting in her twelve tokens all at once.

791
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:56,300
They go stupid.

792
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:01,760
nephew to school. We don't want to go back. We will never want to go back. It's Christmas

793
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:02,760
vacation time.

794
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,180
I don't have to go to school.

795
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:10,920
I don't have to go to school either. Ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

796
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,920
I have to go to work though.

797
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,120
At least I'm not one of those corporate whore types.

798
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:18,380
Hey, I can surf the internet at work.

799
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:19,380
Me too. He he.

800
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:25,520
Hey, I download 500 megs worth of sim files every day, so ha. Oh, I got a late one. I

801
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,520
I got a late one. It's from a new person in our chat room, so say hello to the new person.

802
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,520
It better come late than never.

803
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:34,520
This new person was asking about DDR in Auburn, by the way. Where the hell is there a machine up there, Brad?

804
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,520
Second mix.

805
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:40,520
Okay, they used to have a third mix at the, uh, some Pizza Express. It's not there, I hear.

806
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,520
But there is a second mix. Probably the only one in all of California.

807
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,520
I wanna play!

808
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:50,520
It's in the, um, signature theaters, and the volume is all the way down. So try playing BeatMania with no sound. It's pretty fun.

809
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,660
fun.

810
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:54,920
Anyway, Tadpole says, I want to say, fuck you, to my grandma, for making me turn the

811
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:58,900
volume down solo. I can't hardly hear anything. Fuck you to Pizza Express for not having DDR

812
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:03,420
anymore. And a great big fuck you to gas stations for gas being so damn expensive. Ooh, even

813
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:03,420
that?

814
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:04,980
Yeah.

815
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:04,980
Fuck gas.

816
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:11,980
So I don't try.

817
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:15,620
Oh.

818
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:16,340
Treadrag. Treadrag.

819
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:20,220
i guess that that one about uh... the seven points in the max two is actually

820
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:23,080
from when they somehow missed it because uh...

821
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,140
he doesn't count

822
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:25,540
i don't know

823
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,740
no i had it on the

824
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:30,420
c i thought this thing was for both of those of us

825
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:33,060
whatever anyway who cares

826
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:35,380
moving on

827
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:37,960
that's all of our if he's the way those beautiful wasn't

828
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,860
are we going to another

829
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:40,560
we want to talk

830
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,460
talk more about

831
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:45,060
titty our orders let's talk to our our guests that we don't have here on the

832
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:50,060
show very much. Like, ever. Let's talk to Stress on DDR Angel.

833
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:57,060
Ugh, Loki. I just want to make a comment. I like that fort. That fort was cool.

834
01:00:57,060 --> 01:01:04,060
Yes, yes. I live up in the boondocks, up in northern...well, I'm out there. If you know

835
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:09,980
where Santa Rosa is, you're likely to find me there. The fort is cool. I wish I could

836
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:13,340
take a trip out there. The fort is damn sexy.

837
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:16,840
We don't know if people live there, because we do see smoke every occasionally, but nobody

838
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,400
ever really checks it out.

839
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,200
Go figure.

840
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:24,120
Could it be those big graffiti signs that say, keep out of the fort?

841
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,120
Very well possible.

842
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:31,440
Of course, you know, we should still make that image for Jamie, the Jamie New World

843
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,240
Order, beginning in the fort.

844
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:37,240
Let's start my own cult, we'll move into a compound.

845
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,240
Woot.

846
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:47,200
Well, it actually might be considered a dark black forest, but of course Jamie will have

847
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:52,040
the interesting opportunity to meet said forest.

848
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:58,080
Be the army of Stoics, and I will have a dark black forest because I don't particularly

849
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,320
care for that song.

850
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:09,640
overplayed but I want I want my own compound where I can make people I want

851
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:13,520
to recruit stupid people in this compound and then make them die face

852
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:19,400
first in the pool of jello I say we all quit our jobs and move into the fort yes

853
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:24,640
we must move into the fort orange lounge live from the fort next week all right

854
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:28,600
so there's the fort how are you doing angel we haven't heard much from you

855
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:39,600
Why did you start playing DDR? What got you into DDR? Was it the flashing seizure lights or the music?

856
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:40,600
The truth or other?

857
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:45,600
Other. We never tell the truth in the show.

858
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:46,600
I don't know.

859
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:50,600
Alright, so most of us don't know why we play DDR.

860
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,600
I got conned into it.

861
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,600
You got conned into it. Good answer.

862
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,600
And then I couldn't stop. And I still haven't stopped.

863
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,600
It's an STD all of its own.

864
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,600
It's an STD all of its own.

865
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,600
Is DDR a disease? Maybe it is.

866
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:09,600
It's an addiction.

867
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,600
It's an addiction and I need help.

868
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,600
Unfortunately, they don't have a 12-step program for this yet.

869
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,600
And they're not going to, because whoever tries to start one, I'll kill.

870
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:23,600
It's an addiction like crack, cocaine, and alcohol, and then Longerburger baskets and things like that.

871
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,600
It's an addiction that's good for you.

872
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,600
Vanilla crack. Vanilla crack!

873
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,600
Propel.

874
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:33,600
Hi, my name is the 23rd Magus and I'm a Romani addict.

875
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,600
Get me a gun.

876
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,600
Isn't this the point where we're supposed to clap or do something?

877
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,600
Isn't the point where someone's supposed to go,

878
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,600
Hi, Magus!

879
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,600
Hi, Magus!

880
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,600
There we go!

881
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,600
Gee, I'm feeling better now.

882
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,600
You know what? I think that it's really...

883
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:59,040
The Space Aliens came and invented the Bimani series, no, it was Tran's race.

884
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:06,600
This is the great space Kog'Al Tran came on her flying saucer with her cat and her snowmobile

885
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,720
and decided to make us all Bimani addicts.

886
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,600
Ooh, the snowblower of doom.

887
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,040
You haven't seen the video, watch the video for some reason.

888
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,440
This is DDR, not the last Starfighter.

889
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,840
It is like that, see, they're going to make us into an incredible race of rhythm-dancing

890
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:24,840
And at the last war, at the end of the world, we're all going to have to dance off against the aliens.

891
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,840
That would work, except for one thing. We're not Asian.

892
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,840
Oh, exactly.

893
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,840
But I am.

894
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,840
Yeah, exactly. See, we kill any deaths to the kneecaps.

895
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:42,840
Hey, I may be honky with no reason, but there are some Asians here who can help.

896
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:47,840
I don't know. If you count maybe about 150 years back, I could qualify.

897
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:57,840
Late fuck you to pizza for being so damn yummy and good that I eat it all and I get fat in my arteries and I die.

898
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,840
Ugh!

899
01:04:58,840 --> 01:04:59,840
Yay, Dad!

900
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,840
Propelico! Ugh!

901
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:08,840
Yeah, anyways, as far as the beginning of my Bomani DDR-type addiction, it was because of Angel!

902
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:14,840
It was she who conned me into it, and ever since, I don't quite know what's become of me.

903
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:18,840
Yes, but you have gone from one step to five, all in one day!

904
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,840
Have a murder cookie!

905
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,840
They're death-orific!

906
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,840
Yes, cookie! Death cookie!

907
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,840
I'm really scared.

908
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,840
For the people who aren't seeing these, we have holiday Oreos.

909
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,840
They can't call them Christmas Oreos because it's not politically correct.

910
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:36,840
So they're holiday Oreos, with red filling.

911
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:39,840
And they're red, like they're stained with blood.

912
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,840
Like a tampon.

913
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:45,840
Now they're menstrual cookies!

914
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:49,840
We'll call it mensios.

915
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:53,840
That's disgusting.

916
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:57,840
It tastes like a cycle.

917
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:01,840
I feel bad because I forgot to check the mailbag for the FUs of the week.

918
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:05,840
There was one sitting in there so I've got to do it.

919
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:09,840
You can't always send an email though if you want.

920
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:13,880
You want to hear more? How about the tax on you wouldn't let me play for anyone else, okay? All right? Oh?

921
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,840
Wait he requested a song for ZF you should I give it to him?

922
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,120
No, I never let people have their requested songs so deal

923
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:27,360
All right, I'll be nice because only because we forgot okay

924
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,240
Muhaimer

925
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:36,200
Muhaimer says yay for drunk parents and their friends making drunk eat the snowman outside my house on New Year's Eve by

926
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,600
Decorating him with beer noisemakers in the hat

927
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,600
That is the winner!

928
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,600
That is the best FU I think I've ever read on this show.

929
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,600
Look at the eventually drunk squirrels running around.

930
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,600
That was worth going back to the FU segment for right there.

931
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,600
Drunky the snowman.

932
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,600
I want to make one.

933
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,600
Now featured on DTRPC.

934
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,600
Stressa is a dirty cowgirl!

935
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,600
I'm a little girl

936
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,600

01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:24,180
No, then we take money away.

997
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:29,180
Alright, we're going to go to a break.

We'll be back after some happy fun joy songs.

999

Happy, happy JoJo!

1000
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:35,180
State of mind, and I'm here to talk to you

1001
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:38,180
Space man, state of mind, break me away

1002
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:42,180
Instead of flying to the Milky Way

1003
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:45,180
Space man, state of mind, waiting for you

1004
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:49,180
Instead of flying, waiting to the blue

1005
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:52,180
Take me out tonight, another star so bright

1006
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:56,180
I wanna see your rocket

1007
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:59,180
Flying to the space, to a far galactic place

1008
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:00,780
Know how to rock it

1009
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:02,780
Know how to rock it

1010
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:05,780
Flying out to the part that's old

1011
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:09,780
Fighting all alone

1012
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:12,780
Boy have I got a dream for you

1013
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:16,180
When you're coming back home

1014
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:19,180
Bait man, bait man, take me away

1015
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:23,180
And then fly into the milky way

1016
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:26,180
Bait man, bait man, waiting for you

1017
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:30,180
And fly away to the moon

1018
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:32,180
Nandandira tari...

1019
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:33,180
Nandandira tari...

1020
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:35,180
Nandandira tari...

1021
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:37,180
You are my favorite!

1022
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:39,180
Nandandira tari...

1023
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:41,180
Nandandira tari...

1024
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:43,180
Nandandira tari...

1025
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:49,180
What you gonna say if I ask you to get outplay with your ammunition?

1026
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:54,180
Flying by the wall like you've never seen before

1027
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:56,180
It's time for addition

1028
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:58,180
Time for addition

1029
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:01,180
Flying out to the combat zone

1030
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:05,180
Fighting all along

1031
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:08,180
What have I got to see for you

1032
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:11,180
When you're coming back home?

1033
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:14,180
Bait man, bait man, take me away

1034
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:18,180
Let's fly into the Milky Way

1035
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:21,180
Bait man, bait man, waiting for you

1036
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:54,540

1037
01:15:54,540 --> 01:16:01,140
Bait man, bait man, take me away and let's fly into a milky way

1038
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:08,580
Bait man, bait man, waiting for you, and let's fly away into the blue

1039
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:15,540
Bait man, bait man, take me away and let's fly into a milky way

1040
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:22,540
Bateman, Bateman, waiting for you, and then fly away to the moon.

1041
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:28,540
Bateman, Bateman, Bateman, Bateman.

1042
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:32,540
The following bit of randomness has been brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

1043
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:34,540
Dateline, the Muppet Show.

1044
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:38,540
It has been reported just moments ago that a large, heavy object was dropped from the ceiling.

1045
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:40,540
Further developments will...

1046
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:41,540
Hey, any balls down there?

1047
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:44,540
About the biggest bird you've ever seen, Diggleberry!

1048
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:12,540
talk about. I don't have anything to do with it.

1049
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:16,540
Uh, do I have to do everything? Oh yeah, let's hear a sim update before we get to list list.

1050
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:18,540
And we'll do a list list. Let's do a sim update.

1051
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:23,740
Uh, sim update. Finally, we can stop playing DDRPC if you haven't done it yet because they

1052
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:28,540
released the last stupid character set. Not that anyone even fucking cares anymore because

1053
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:33,500
I don't. The game sucks ass. But if you care, it's some stupid princess and some prince

1054
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:39,460
guy, and I don't care, it's crap. Whatever. Enjoy. So, they're there for your enjoyment.

1055
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:45,460
Um, aside from that, Turning Mix 3 is wrapping up. Tomorrow should have the results, um, they're...

1056
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:53,460
I'd have to say this has been the worst run tournament I've ever seen, and they should all burn in hell for it, and I'm gonna do better for it.

1057
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:57,460
I'm gonna do a better tournament than they will, because I own them!

1058
01:17:57,460 --> 01:18:00,460
Speaking of which, how did Make Edit Get Porn go?

1059
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:06,460
Well, you know what? Some people just don't understand this concept of deadlines.

1060
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:12,460
So you know what? The people sent me edits to get porn. The people didn't. Go fuck themselves!

1061
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:15,460
You should give me porn anyway.

1062
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:21,460
I know, I have plenty of porn to give away. I mean, people don't like porn in my work for some reason. I don't know why.

1063
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:24,460
They just put it in the coffee room and I take it.

1064
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:26,460
I think that porn is funny.

1065
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:29,460
But, yeah. Porn blows. Get it?

1066
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:31,460
How's that?

1067
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:33,500
But yeah, so that's what's going on.

1068
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:36,260
As I mentioned slightly earlier, there's going to be a

1069
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:39,420
Leech from Loki 2.0s coming up, because I got web hosting

1070
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:43,300
thanks to DDR Alama from DDR Mania X and Chris Stanford

1071
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:44,460
from the Step Mania site.

1072
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:46,700
They're giving me web hosting with unlimited space and

1073
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:49,260
limited bandwidth, so I get to put whatever the fuck I want

1074
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:50,020
on there.

1075
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:52,180
I guess they're trying to challenge me to crash the

1076
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:54,060
boards or something, but whatever.

1077
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:56,540
So I'm going to put all my SIM files on there slowly in

1078
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:57,140
theme packs.

1079
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:59,860
We're going to do interviews with step file makers and that

1080
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:00,340
kind of thing.

1081
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:11,340
So, that's pretty much what's coming up. Right now I'm just redoing the design of the site because I have to try to figure out how the fuck to sort 2100 step files. So, that'll be fun.

1082
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:24,340
Aside from that, do check out bmonistyle. They're putting up all week long the new DDR Extreme DWIs. In fact, they're the thing for the Legend of Max and Paranoid Survivor samples.

1083
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:30,980
So, definitely check them out if you haven't yet for Sim Files and that kind of thing.

1084
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:34,220
Really aside from that, not too much going on other than, you know, DDR Extreme coming

1085
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:39,000
out and, you know, us finding out more about it, but looks like we pretty much, you know,

1086
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,900
we know what songs are going to be hidden in there.

1087
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:45,580
And I have a continued little rant, sort of.

1088
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:48,500
Basically this is a fuck you to everyone that said I was wrong about Sakura being in fucking

1089
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:53,660
DDR Extreme because I knew I called it a long ass time ago and all of you naysayers can

1090
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:58,740
burn in hell

1091
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:02,000
so that's all

1092
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,220
okay i i went back to over the mailbag to uh... look at some

1093
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:10,220
back to see if we've got

1094
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:12,620
you do

1095
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:17,100
i would see if we got an email and guess what we do we have a question

1096
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:19,820
from uh... so cal kicks of course

1097
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:23,820
It's a question specifically for Loki.

1098
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:27,820
Can I have the Robotech Macross Saga DVDs?

1099
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:32,380
Well, if I had them to give, then yeah.

1100
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:34,720
But I don't, so no.

1101
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:35,720
Can I have some more porn?

1102
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:38,660
I have titles I like.

1103
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:43,020
All I get is the stupid Playboy shit, and so, you know, I pretty much gave you all the,

1104
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,420
well, some of the new stuff.

1105
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:45,420
I guess, yeah.

1106
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:48,140
You know, whatever I have.

1107
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:51,500
He says at the end, PayPal may come if two or more of the requests are met.

1108
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:56,860
I don't know how two or more is possible, because you only made two requests!

1109
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:57,860
You're being edumacated, apparently.

1110
01:20:57,860 --> 01:21:02,480
You know what, if he actually came up here to visit us instead, he could come to my house

1111
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:05,980
and not only watch all the Robotech stuff, but watch all the Macross stuff, because I

1112
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:09,300
happen to have the whole box set.

1113
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:12,940
And Final Fuck X, which I got a copy of last night.

1114
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:16,140
Your HP tastes good!

1115
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:17,140
Did it turn out alright?

1116
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:21,140
Yeah, it was cool. It's just VCD quality, whatever, you know.

1117
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:25,140
It's the same as the other VCDs I have from Japan. They're porn, they're censored.

1118
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:29,140
Censored porn sucks. It's like made-for-TV porn.

1119
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:33,140
Alright, I'm opening up another email here.

1120
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:36,140
Dark Tetsuya wants to know, when will you put more of an SMA into rotation?

1121
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:39,140
I do have a request for one song. I want to hear Red Hot. It's really cool.

1122
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:41,140
Yeah, all of mine's on MP3s are porn.

1123
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:43,140
All of, oh wow.

1124
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:44,140
Whoa!

1125
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:46,140
Was that like that letter bit?

1126
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:51,700
All of my MP3s, by the way, because I've had all the Vanessa May stuff, they're gone, because

1127
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:52,700
guess what?

1128
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:57,100
My hard drive broke, so you send me red hot, it'll make it into rotation.

1129
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:58,820
All right, we'll get red hot into rotation.

1130
01:21:58,820 --> 01:21:59,820
I need a noose!

1131
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:01,860
Damn you, you Vanessa May damn whore, all right.

1132
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:03,660
Jamie made a noose.

1133
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:06,500
She has a noose on her neck, and I have a noose on my neck.

1134
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,500
This is weird.

1135
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,500
Okay.

1136
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:09,500
Moving on.

1137
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:14,500
Hey, dual mic penetration.

1138
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:17,900
i want my news back

1139
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:19,140
okay

1140
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:20,560
uh...

1141
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,980
let's talk about some show news things that have happened in the past uh...

1142
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,700
coming in the future the show

1143
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:27,700
uh... voters

1144
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:29,700
you said coming

1145
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,180
you slide

1146
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:38,180
i'm sorry to know what did you say that you're a slight

1147
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:42,180
I love you all night long if you let me sing for you

1148
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:10,180
From the outside coming in...

1149
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:12,180
Your eyes still work. Your eyes still work.

1150
01:23:12,180 --> 01:23:13,180
This is...

1151
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:14,180
You made me watch Showgirls.

1152
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:16,180
I did make her watch Showgirls.

1153
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:17,180
That's a good movie.

1154
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:18,180
That's a good movie.

1155
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:20,180
For me to poop on!

1156
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:24,180
I never actually thought it would be something like this.

1157
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:26,180
But, when you enter this...

1158
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:28,180
Whoa! Hello!

1159
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:30,180
I just got a little show there.

1160
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:32,180
When did the studio turn into a gay nightclub? Stop that!

1161
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:37,180
He almost gave me a lap dance.

1162
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:41,180
The weird part about it is, I was still standing.

1163
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:44,180
News!

1164
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:47,180
Why don't you sit on this?

1165
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:52,180
And now he's been tied.

1166
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:54,180
I'm sorry, you had a thought?

1167
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:57,180
No, no, it was coming into this from the outside.

1168
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:59,180
Yeah, I said it again.

1169
01:23:59,180 --> 01:24:01,180
Look who's the dirty slut now!

1170
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:05,180
Maybe coming to be our worst nightmare.

1171
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:17,180
Hi, I have news. I wanted to get to Orange Lounge News because this is actually really

1172
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:23,700
big news. We've made our first bestest friends on the interweb and those buddies of ours

1173
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:32,540
I saw your tummy. I'm blind. Our new bestest friends on the interweb are located at east

1174
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:36,580
eastofosaka.net

1175
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:41,580
and jamie had to do a lot of that to get this to happen, no I'm kidding, I'm kidding

1176
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:43,380
37? In a what?

1177
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:45,540
Trying not to suck any dick out of the parking lot

1178
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:48,460
Hey, you get back here

1179
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:52,800
all right uh... yes eastofosaka.net, they're our friends, our bestest friends on the net

1180
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:57,180
and uh... they've led us onto their forums so if you thought the orange lounge forums

1181
01:24:57,180 --> 01:24:58,740
sucked on uh... the little

1182
01:24:58,740 --> 01:25:00,660
free thing we had then fine

1183
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:04,760
We've got cool forums now because they're a part of the East of Osaka.net forums, so

1184
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:08,820
my avatar owns all of you.

1185
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:12,540
I still think mine's cooler because I actually spent a long time working on it.

1186
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:18,000
Of course, it's the same one I use on DDR Freak and on Step Squad board, and I would

1187
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:23,980
use it on Sack of Imani, but we can't have them.

1188
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:25,700
We have one thing to say.

1189
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:29,020
You don't love us!

1190
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:30,540
What the hell was that for?

1191
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:31,540
We love you!

1192
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:32,540
Yay!

1193
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:34,540
You guys all ran away.

1194
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:41,620
Cause you said you loved them and then you didn't say us and we visited you.

1195
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:42,840
I love everybody.

1196
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,580
Listen you guys, I'm a huge slut, okay?

1197
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:45,580
I love everybody.

1198
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:46,580
I love you!

1199
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:53,580
I'm getting a lap dance, three of them, all at once.

1200
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:55,500
I'm gonna go hide in the corner.

1201
01:25:55,500 --> 01:26:01,060
Anyway, the link to the new boards are being posted in the chatroom now, or if you are

1202
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:06,020
too lazy to follow the links in the chatroom, just go to our site, orangelounge.skie.cx,

1203
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:07,500
click on forums, and it takes you to the new forums.

1204
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:10,300
And if you don't, we'll kick your ass.

1205
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:11,940
You'll lose our love.

1206
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:12,940
And the forum crew.

1207
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:17,340
I don't want to lose your love tonight.

1208
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:18,840
Okay.

1209
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,780
So definitely check out the new forums.

1210
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:28,340
And next week, next Saturday, is a pretty nifty tournament going on in Fremont.

1211
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:33,400
And I think this is the first time, besides Shaft, that all three hosts will be attending

1212
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:34,400
a tournament together.

1213
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:35,400
All three of us.

1214
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,400
Am I correct?

1215
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,400
One of them might be competing.

1216
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,400
Yeah.

1217
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:39,400
Oh, you're going to compete?

1218
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:40,400
I'm at GPA.

1219
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,400
Oh, very cool.

1220
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:42,400
You're not going to compete, Logie.

1221
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,400
Okay, we'll go cheer Jamie on.

1222
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,300
I may or may not do PA.

1223
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,860
We're all going to be going to Fremont to check out the tournament there.

1224
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:48,860
It's at some pizza place.

1225
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:51,740
I don't remember the details because I'm lazy, but DCV's in the chat room.

1226
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:53,740
How does it matter? They have pizza there.

1227
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:54,740
That's all that matters.

1228
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:58,740
DCB can post a link for all of you to go visit if you want to come to the tournament.

1229
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:00,740
We'll be there doing interviews and stuff.

1230
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:03,740
And DCB wants you to pre-reg.

1231
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:09,740
If I have the money to a man, I'm getting keyboard mania tomorrow, so my money's kind of tight.

1232
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:10,740
Alright.

1233
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:11,740
I'll bring the bat though.

1234
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:13,740
Oh, we need to get new bats to have everyone sign.

1235
01:27:13,740 --> 01:27:14,740
Okay, that's a good idea. We'll go get new bats.

1236
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:19,740
I've got to go buy a new orange bat because everyone signed them at the Mountain Mike's tourney, so I have to buy a new bat.

1237
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:20,740
Yeah.

1238
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:23,920
Alright, there's the link to the page right there.

1239
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:26,840
Rabbeats.com slash tilde killer pals slash Fremont2.html.

1240
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:31,940
You'll never remember that so just click the link in the chatroom.

1241
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:32,940
Internet.

1242
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:36,480
The interweb!

1243
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:40,740
You're showing us pictures of, oh it's the ghetto DDR extreme 8th mix sign from Stockton

1244
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:41,740
Golf Land.

1245
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:42,740
Nice.

1246
01:27:42,740 --> 01:27:43,740
Very nice.

1247
01:27:43,740 --> 01:27:46,980
Speaking of which, we got to check out the nice ghetto max 2 that they're giving away

1248
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:48,020
in the cyber returning.

1249
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:49,020
Oh my lord.

1250
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:52,020
I hope they clean it up. I hope they clean it up a little.

1251
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:54,020
I'm looking forward to that tourney a lot.

1252
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:57,020
It's a machine, but there's not much of a machine.

1253
01:27:57,020 --> 01:28:00,020
We've got another question in our inbox.

1254
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:02,020
I want to answer it.

1255
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:05,020
Do you like big cock?

1256
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:07,020
It's a rude question. I don't think you'll want to answer that one.

1257
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:10,020
I do, because no one else loves the cock.

1258
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:13,020
We'll have a real guest.

1259
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:15,020
Wait! That's the question!

1260
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:19,020
They want to send that they want no one orange light no style and wants to know when the orange line was gonna have a real

1261
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:21,020
guest

1262
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:28,100
Fuck you no style. I will show my at my hey

1263
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:31,700
Board starts coming over here. I'm all for it. Okay

1264
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:36,340
Hey, you know, I think somebody just want to have their name right on the radio. Well

1265
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:41,900
You had something you wanna say Jimmy are you gonna you're not gonna go jump off a bridge with that thing around the neck

1266
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,900
Are you big cock?

1267
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:47,900
Is that going to be our special guest, or big black cock?

1268
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:51,900
Alright, tonight's special guest, my cock. Say hello.

1269
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:55,900
Is your cock black?

1270
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:59,900
I can get a sharpie.

1271
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:03,900
Rob's going to have like little arrows tattooed.

1272
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:07,900
Just dip it in hot fudge or something.

1273
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:11,900
That is a big brown cock. A very hot cock.

1274
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:17,660
I don't know if I like this show reverting to discussions about my cock, but in a way it's kind of cool

1275
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:20,340
You brought it up my friend

1276
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:22,980
And I'm bringing it up right now

1277
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:26,540
It got all over me

1278
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:33,980
And Rob was delivered a sharpie

1279
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:37,980
Put it away! Put it on! Put it on!

1280
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:41,980
What do you do to keep that thing in your pants?

1281
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:45,980
I pander my dick.

1282
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:49,980
Is there a difference?

1283
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:53,980
I'd like to see a freestyle routine where somebody just whips their cock out at the end.

1284
01:29:53,980 --> 01:29:57,980
What song would that be good to?

1285
01:29:57,980 --> 01:30:01,980
Blow My Whistle.

1286
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:06,980
No, we need to do a freestyle routine where we throw dildos into the crowd.

1287
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:09,980
Or those penis-shaped chocolates.

1288
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:15,980
That'll be on paranoia or something. You can just flip your cock out and...

1289
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:21,980
When is somebody going to do a routine where they whip their cock out at the end? Come on.

1290
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:26,980
I'm surprised all you comedians out there like to play DDR. Nobody's done it yet. Come on.

1291
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:32,980
Some women play DDR2, let's see some tits. Let's see a topless DDR routine, come on.

1292
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:39,980
Wait, they have to be good looking. We must make sure there's no food around either.

1293
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:46,980
It's bad enough, those female freestylers who think that they have a good routine just by grabbing their boobs.

1294
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:49,980
You know, that sucks. That's not good freestyle.

1295
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:51,980
What are you talking about, that's not good freestyle?

1296
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:56,980
It's not good freestyle. It's called stripping, not freestyle.

1297
01:30:56,980 --> 01:30:59,980
It's good Maxim magazine, bad freestyle.

1298
01:30:59,980 --> 01:31:01,980
It's called maybe slut style.

1299
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:08,980
Hey, I had a check mark on all of my judging little forms there. Grab boobs then, okay?

1300
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:13,980
I had to make a provision when doing the rules for shaft, no boob grabbing.

1301
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:18,980
Because that doesn't make a good routine.

1302
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:22,980
Okay, that's getting into one of my pet peeves of DDR freestyling.

1303
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:23,980
Ooh, let's hear it.

1304
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:25,980
Don't grab your boobs!

1305
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:26,980
What if I...

1306
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:27,980
I'm sorry.

1307
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:28,980
What if I grab my boobs?

1308
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:29,980
Is that okay?

1309
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:30,980
Okay, wait, wait.

1310
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:32,980
What if Alan Rickman got on stage and started whipping out his cock?

1311
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:34,980
Okay, first of all, he wouldn't.

1312
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:35,980
Okay.

1313
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:36,980
But you know what?

1314
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:42,980
I don't see the male freestylers grabbing their dick or anything while they're freestyling.

1315
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:46,980
I will enter a routine and I will grab my dick during the routine.

1316
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:48,980
I'll make you happy if I do my suggestion.

1317
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:50,980
I wonder why you suggest it?

1318
01:31:50,980 --> 01:31:52,980
I'm using it as an example, okay?

1319
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:53,980
Oh, okay.

1320
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:55,980
You know I'm a crazy bastard, I'll do it.

1321
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:58,980
I can't freestyle, so at least I'll get a laugh when I grab my dick, you know?

1322
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:00,980
Hey, it's a whole new meaning to PA.

1323
01:32:00,980 --> 01:32:02,980
Penis attack.

1324
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:04,980
Awesome.

1325
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:07,980
Hey, Evan.

1326
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:12,980
Every day with Rob is a penis attack.

1327
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:14,980
I figured out how to make one.

1328
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:17,980
Oh great, we have a double-ended noose. How kinky.

1329
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:20,980
That's for the goth sex pervert, right?

1330
01:32:20,980 --> 01:32:23,980
And it's black. Does it glow in the dark?

1331
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:26,980
You tell me it's yours.

1332
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:28,980
You gotta make it all flopsy.

1333
01:32:28,980 --> 01:32:31,980
Get your own goddamn mic. Hold on a second, hold on a second. Here we go.

1334
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:33,980
Here's the stupidest thing to do on radio. Watch this.

1335
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:36,980
Okay, I'm going to use the mic and I'm going to make it funny.

1336
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:39,980
Are you ready? Okay, here's a gay man's...

1337
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:46,980
Here's a lesbian's nightmare.

1338
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:52,980
Here's a gay man's nightmare.

1339
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:53,980
There you go.

1340
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:55,980
Nobody in the audience.

1341
01:32:55,980 --> 01:32:57,980
That was very intentional.

1342
01:32:57,980 --> 01:33:00,980
Now, Rob, try to describe that.

1343
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:02,980
I had a question for you, Evan.

1344
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:08,980
Evan, why do you think nobody's whipped their cock out at the end of a DDR routine yet?

1345
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:13,980
Because we haven't seen the private DDR routines that Brad and Irene have.

1346
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:17,980
Late at night.

1347
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:22,980
And you know what, hold on a second, before Brad says anything, I do want to make this parting comment.

1348
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:27,980
Although I haven't seen it, I have heard that Irene's cock is quite nice.

1349
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:32,980
Oh boy.

1350
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:37,980
Yeah.

1351
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:44,740
We're going to take a quick break at this point because we've reached our cot quotient

1352
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:50,500
of the show and we're going to come back and we're going to play the match game live in

1353
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:51,500
studio.

1354
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,300
We're going to do listless first?

1355
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:54,300
Yeah.

1356
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:55,660
Let's list the match game.

1357
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:56,660
We always do match game.

1358
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:57,900
We got to do the cage match some way too.

1359
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:58,900
Yeah, we have to do cage match.

1360
01:33:58,900 --> 01:33:59,900
Let's do the cage match now.

1361
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:00,900
Okay.

1362
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:01,900
All right.

1363
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:02,900
Fuck the break.

1364
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:03,900
We'll do the cage match.

1365
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:04,900
All right.

1366
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:05,900
Here we go.

1367
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:06,900
Let them break.

1368
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:11,580
going to talk about last or two weeks ago we didn't do a cage match last week

1369
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:18,620
correct no no I didn't so last week two weeks ago in the orange lounge cage

1370
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:23,640
match where we pit songs against each other because we like to we had a Yumi

1371
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:28,620
Hamasaki win with connected in a very very very close vote I believe it came

1372
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:32,100
down to a game of rock-paper-scissors fuck all of you for not voting for

1373
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:35,900
Knight Rider bitches yeah Knight Rider was the shit but unfortunately it lost

1374
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:41,380
fuck me for being bad at rock, paper, scissors

1375
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:43,060
alright so uh...

1376
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:44,360
the first

1377
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:48,180
the first time you're able to vote for one of three songs

1378
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:53,020
in the cage match, you can vote for last week's winner

1379
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:53,940
i'm engrish today

1380
01:34:53,940 --> 01:34:57,860
here's last week's winner, two weeks ago's winner, this is how Yumi Hamasaki

1381
01:34:57,860 --> 01:35:24,060
with connected. Here's a little clip. Alright, that's the Yumi Hamasaki with connected. That's

1382
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:26,540
the first one you can vote for us last week's winner

1383
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:30,500
this first pick in the cage matches the group called bond

1384
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:34,720
with the song called way go to play out of this they have this for us

1385
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:36,700
it's short cool and way go

1386
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:39,980
all right here it is this first song in the cage matching before this week

1387
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:43,100
seconds i'm sorry you go for you and start hearing about this is bond with

1388
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:50,100
Fuego.

1389
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:47,100
I love that song. Anything with the name Fuego.

1390
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:50,100
Because I like fire.

1391
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:53,100
That was a pretty neat song. What did you all think of that?

1392
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:56,100
Let's go around the room. What did you think of it and judge it on a scale of 1 to 10?

1393
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:58,100
It's awesome 10.

1394
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:01,100
I think Fuego tastes pretty good, that soda.

1395
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:05,100
Oh, Fuego. That is a really cool song. Somebody should make steps for that for DDR.

1396
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:06,100
Loki?

1397
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:09,100
Don't look at me. I'm not going to friggin' make that.

1398
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:14,220
I give it an eight because it just sounds like Vanessa Mae.

1399
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:17,140
I'll do it. Seven. Good.

1400
01:39:17,140 --> 01:39:20,100
Uh, personally I think that deserves an eight.

1401
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:23,420
I don't know. I'm also very partial to Fire.

1402
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:30,420
It does wonderful things for me.

1403
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:33,220
Angel says 9.5.

1404
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:34,460
She says I instead.

1405
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:38,980
Uh, I agree. It's Vanessa Mae the sequel, but it's still pretty cool, so I give it a nine.

1406
01:39:38,980 --> 01:39:44,980
Alright, moving on, the next song. Loki, tell us about this one. Now we're only going to play part of this song, correct?

1407
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:46,980
Yeah, because it's like an eight minute long song.

1408
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:48,980
So we're going to play a few minutes of it, so tell us about this song.

1409
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:53,980
This song was entered in Turning Mix 3, the cut-down version of it was.

1410
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:59,980
This is an mp3.com artist, which should be going mainstream, I hope, soon.

1411
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:02,980
It's AirBass with their song Spin.

1412
01:40:02,980 --> 01:40:07,140
And after this is over you can vote for this one if you want. This is airbase with spin

1413
01:40:32,980 --> 01:40:34,980
Oh

1414
01:45:32,980 --> 01:46:00,340
Alright, that was Air Bass for the song called Spin, that wasn't even the whole thing.

1415
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:02,340
So, that's the end of the Cade Smash.

1416
01:46:02,340 --> 01:46:03,340
I meant for Hollick.

1417
01:46:03,340 --> 01:46:04,340
Three songs.

1418
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:09,340
You have Yumi Hamasaki, last week's winner was Connected, Bond with Fuego, and Airbase

1419
01:46:09,340 --> 01:46:10,340
with Spin.

1420
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:15,340
Uh, you guys can vote now, send your votes over a private message to Skye, and while

1421
01:46:15,340 --> 01:46:17,340
you send your votes, let's hear the verdicts on Airbase.

1422
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:18,340
Drop.

1423
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:19,340
What?

1424
01:46:19,340 --> 01:46:20,340
Drop.

1425
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:21,340
Yes.

1426
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:22,340
Hi.

1427
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:23,340
Hi.

1428
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:24,340
It was repetitive.

1429
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:25,340
He thought it was repetitive.

1430
01:46:25,340 --> 01:46:26,340
Scale of one to ten.

1431
01:46:26,340 --> 01:46:29,340
I would probably play that in the background while I'm working on banners and stuff and

1432
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:32,740
in my artwork, so I give it a seven and a half.

1433
01:46:32,740 --> 01:46:33,740
Seven and a half, alright.

1434
01:46:33,740 --> 01:46:37,740
It was just more dancey stuff.

1435
01:46:37,740 --> 01:46:40,700
There's nothing wrong with dancey stuff, it's supposed to be long because it's a twelve

1436
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:43,140
inch mix, so you can mix it into other shit, but anyway.

1437
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:44,140
Twelve inches.

1438
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:45,140
Shut up!

1439
01:46:45,140 --> 01:46:47,140
I can't even talk.

1440
01:46:47,140 --> 01:46:53,740
Anyways, um, I like it, it was one of my favorite entries in Fraternity Mix 3, I wish I could

1441
01:46:53,740 --> 01:47:00,740
have had a chance to cut it down so that it'd be less repetitive. But anyways, I'd give

1442
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:01,820
it a 10.

1443
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:04,900
Alright. Brad, what did you think of Airbase's spin?

1444
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:11,340
Cool, but they should have DDR sized, it would have been great. So, I'd give it a 7 as it

1445
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:12,180
is.

1446
01:47:12,180 --> 01:47:17,340
Alright. Dave, what you heard of it? By the way, hi.

1447
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:27,340
Yeah, hi! I just kinda came in and took pictures, but I guess I was kind of listening, so I give it a seven and a half.

1448
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:28,340
You're full of shit.

1449
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:29,340
Magus!

1450
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:32,340
Blade ten, fear out.

1451
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:33,340
Stressa.

1452
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:38,340
Well, that was easily said. Um, I actually am quite fond of this track, I think.

1453
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:42,340
Wow, such spirit. Um, I'm gonna give that an eight.

1454
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:45,340
Uh oh, I'm tied.

1455
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:46,340
Angel, what do you think?

1456
01:47:46,340 --> 01:47:53,340
you think? I said, um, time. Um, it's kind of a bullet thing. Uh, I'll give it an 8,

1457
01:47:57,340 --> 01:48:03,020
sorry. Alright, an 8. Uh, I liked it, it was cool, except I didn't like that re-re-re

1458
01:48:03,020 --> 01:48:08,020
part, and uh, Bond was better, so, uh, Fuego was better, so I can't rank it higher than

1459
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:13,340
that, so I'll give it an 8. Alright, so, the votes are coming in right now, we'll

1460
01:48:13,340 --> 01:48:18,340
I need to send you all He-Man likes big butts.

1461
01:48:18,340 --> 01:48:21,340
I'll find that file and send it to you later.

1462
01:48:21,340 --> 01:48:27,340
So you can vote for Ayumi, you can vote for Bond with Fuego, or you can vote for Airbase.

1463
01:48:27,340 --> 01:48:29,340
Rob's good at typing with one hand.

1464
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:30,340
I'm typing with one hand.

1465
01:48:30,340 --> 01:48:32,340
I wonder how you got so good, Rob.

1466
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:35,340
Okay, so we'll tally those votes during the next segment.

1467
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:39,340
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time once again for...

1468
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:42,340
The Orange Lounge Match Game.

1469
01:48:42,340 --> 01:48:54,340
Now tonight is special, usually we let the chat room play along, and we do encourage them to play along, however we have so many people in the studio tonight, we're going to have live contestants, so we can get live reactions and everything like that.

1470
01:48:54,340 --> 01:48:59,340
So, if you guys want to play along in the chat room, you can send us your suggestions, that would be great.

1510
01:50:47,980 --> 01:50:51,460
When the arcade manager came over, he took one look at the pad and said,

1511
01:50:51,460 --> 01:50:58,460
Damn it, Sammy! You got blank all over the dance pad!

1512
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:06,580

When the arcade manager came over, he took one look at the pad and said,

1528
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:48,500
Damn it, Sammy, you got blank all over the dance pad.

1529

Because I like cock.

1642
01:59:22,140 --> 01:59:25,940
I think because there was so much mention of cock that was matched up with each of them

1643
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:26,940
to get a half point.

1644
01:59:26,940 --> 01:59:27,940
Each of them gets a half point?

1645
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:28,940
Yeah.

1646
01:59:28,940 --> 01:59:29,940
Alright, fair enough.

1647
01:59:29,940 --> 01:59:30,940
Fair enough.

1648
01:59:30,940 --> 01:59:31,940
Half a point each.

1649
01:59:31,940 --> 01:59:32,940
Ow!

1650
01:59:32,940 --> 01:59:36,500
we're doing it okay okay guests leave

1651
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:40,220
her we're doing a condensed version so just one more question

1652
01:59:40,220 --> 01:59:43,300
all right one more

1653
01:59:43,300 --> 01:59:46,580
one more question here we go

1654
01:59:46,580 --> 01:59:50,060
out you go

1655
01:59:50,060 --> 01:59:54,460
already out anyway

1656
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:59,140
last question area half a point each

1657
01:59:59,140 --> 02:00:03,700
But here's the next question. Carrie the Camera Whore

1658
02:00:03,700 --> 02:00:09,860
I don't have my music. Carrie the Camera Whore loves to take pictures at DDR tournaments

1659
02:00:09,860 --> 02:00:13,020
but her collection of turdie pics is never complete

1660
02:00:13,020 --> 02:00:20,020
without a picture of blank.

1661
02:00:20,740 --> 02:00:24,660
It would be a female. She's a short little Asian girl with paragoons.

1662
02:00:24,660 --> 02:00:28,660
Hey, what's up, Evan? How you doing?

1663
02:00:28,660 --> 02:00:35,660
Carrie the Camera Whore loves to take pictures at DDR tournaments, but her collection of turny pics is never complete without a picture of blank.

1664
02:00:35,660 --> 02:00:38,660
Yes?

1665
02:00:38,660 --> 02:00:41,660
What? I didn't finish what I can do.

1666
02:00:41,660 --> 02:00:45,660
He just handed me the mic. My God! The pressure! The pressure!

1667
02:00:45,660 --> 02:00:48,660
Okay, this is Carrie the Camera Whore?

1668
02:00:48,660 --> 02:00:49,660
Yes.

1669
02:00:49,660 --> 02:00:52,660
Carrie the Camera Whore! Yes, we all know Carrie, don't we?

1670
02:00:52,660 --> 02:00:56,660
That person who either likes to chat with everybody and take all the pictures and keep them for herself,

1671
02:00:56,660 --> 02:01:00,660
or says that she's going to upload them to the website any day now?

1672
02:01:00,660 --> 02:01:03,660
Oh, I'll upload them tomorrow. I just got them scanned.

1673
02:01:03,660 --> 02:01:05,660
Everybody's writing?

1674
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:07,660
Everybody's writing?

1675
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:11,660
Yeah, everybody knows what you're putting. However, you have to actually write it down.

1676
02:01:11,660 --> 02:01:14,660
Did you write it down?

1677
02:01:14,660 --> 02:01:16,660
In's the rules.

1678
02:01:16,660 --> 02:01:19,660
Who's actually matching?

1679
02:01:19,660 --> 02:01:21,660
Oh.

1680
02:01:23,660 --> 02:01:24,660
Yeah, sure.

1681
02:01:24,660 --> 02:01:26,660
Rob's cock.

1682
02:01:26,660 --> 02:01:28,660
Without a picture of Rob's cock!

1683
02:01:28,660 --> 02:01:29,660
Yes, ladies and gentlemen?

1684
02:01:29,660 --> 02:01:30,660
All right.

1685
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:35,660
You need one of those little tiny microscopic lenses.

1686
02:01:35,660 --> 02:01:36,660
Ha.

1687
02:01:36,660 --> 02:01:37,660
Get the victims.

1688
02:01:37,660 --> 02:01:39,660
All right, here come the victims.

1689
02:01:39,660 --> 02:01:43,660
It's Ra- I am Ravery.

1690
02:01:43,660 --> 02:01:44,660
Carry the camera, whore.

1691
02:01:44,660 --> 02:01:47,660
Oh, sorry, I don't want to read it before they get here.

1692
02:01:47,660 --> 02:01:48,660
Hello, wait.

1693
02:01:48,660 --> 02:01:53,660
Okay, here they come. Here they come. Here I come.

1694
02:01:53,660 --> 02:01:58,660
Alright, here's your question. Stressa, you're first up.

1695
02:01:58,660 --> 02:02:03,660
Stressa, Carrie the Camera Whore loves to take pictures at DER tournaments,

1696
02:02:03,660 --> 02:02:08,660
but her collection of turning picks is never complete without a picture of...

1697
02:02:08,660 --> 02:02:09,660
Upskirt shots.

1698
02:02:09,660 --> 02:02:12,660
Upskirt shots! Very nice.

1699
02:02:12,660 --> 02:02:14,660
Carrie's a lesbian, apparently. Alright.

1700
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:16,660
Carry the camera, horror angel.

1701
02:02:16,660 --> 02:02:17,660
Loves...

1702
02:02:17,660 --> 02:02:21,660
If you like panty shots, you must go out and get the anime.

1703
02:02:21,660 --> 02:02:23,660
Uh, what is it? It's, uh, VR, uh, the, the...

1704
02:02:23,660 --> 02:02:25,660
Night Saver? No, it's, uh...

1705
02:02:25,660 --> 02:02:26,660
Night Saver?

1706
02:02:26,660 --> 02:02:27,660
Go Kaiser?

1707
02:02:27,660 --> 02:02:29,660
No, no, no, no, no. VR 40 fresh! VR 40 fresh!

1708
02:02:29,660 --> 02:02:33,660
You must get VR 40 fresh, because every other shot is a panty shot.

1709
02:02:33,660 --> 02:02:34,660
Upskirt.

1710
02:02:34,660 --> 02:02:37,660
You know, it's amazing how many times I have to crawl through tunnels in that.

1711
02:02:39,660 --> 02:02:42,660
How dare you? You made me forget the question.

1712
02:02:42,660 --> 02:02:44,660
Well, I'll read it to you again.

1713
02:02:44,660 --> 02:02:48,660
Carrie the camera whore loves to take pictures at DDR tournaments,

1714
02:02:48,660 --> 02:02:52,660
but her collection of tourney pics is never complete without a picture of...

1715
02:02:52,660 --> 02:02:55,660
I have to say upskirt shots. I'm sorry.

1716
02:02:55,660 --> 02:02:57,660
Upskirt shots. They're both saying upskirt shots.

1717
02:02:57,660 --> 02:03:02,660
Does genitalia count as an upskirt shot? Because, like, I'm close.

1718
02:03:02,660 --> 02:03:08,660
Why? Because you made me think that way, and that's the first thing I thought of.

1719
02:03:08,660 --> 02:03:10,660
Sure it was. Okay, here we go.

1720
02:03:10,660 --> 02:03:14,660
And Rob, I'm sure you've worn a skirt before.

1721
02:03:14,660 --> 02:03:17,660
Hi, what's up?

1722
02:03:17,660 --> 02:03:18,660
Get out!

1723
02:03:18,660 --> 02:03:21,660
Alright, here we go.

1724
02:03:21,660 --> 02:03:23,660
Starting with Jamie.

1725
02:03:23,660 --> 02:03:26,660
Jamie, that camera...

1726
02:03:26,660 --> 02:03:30,660
Actually, she's always on the cover of National Geographic.

1727
02:03:30,660 --> 02:03:34,660
She's the one washing her clothes in the river.

1728
02:03:34,660 --> 02:03:37,660
You know, topless.

1729
02:03:37,660 --> 02:03:39,660
I'd like to give my answer.

1730
02:04:07,660 --> 02:04:12,660
I'm going to have to modify what, it's pretty much what my answer was going to be.

1731
02:04:12,660 --> 02:04:17,660
Instead of her big black cock, it's going to be her big black cock.

1732
02:04:17,660 --> 02:04:20,660
Her big black cock. Sorry, not a match.

1733
02:04:20,660 --> 02:04:24,660
Dave, her collection of tourney pics is never complete without a picture of...

1734
02:04:24,660 --> 02:04:27,660
Two girls humping the secret rendezvous.

1735
02:04:27,660 --> 02:04:32,660
Two girls humping the secret rendezvous. Beautiful.

1736
02:04:32,660 --> 02:04:35,660
But not a match.

1737
02:04:35,660 --> 02:04:39,660
Thank God that didn't go out on air. Unless you want a mic to say that again.

1738
02:04:39,660 --> 02:04:43,660
Thank God I wasn't given mental imagery of...

1739
02:04:43,660 --> 02:04:47,660
Okay, it happens.

1740
02:04:47,660 --> 02:04:51,660
Brad, her collection of tourney pics was

1741
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:55,660
never complete without a picture of Fiona showing off her ass.

1742
02:04:55,660 --> 02:04:59,660
Thank you, Brad, for saying everything

1743
02:04:59,660 --> 02:05:03,660
we were saying. Her collection of tourney pics was never complete

1744
02:05:03,660 --> 02:05:09,180
without a picture of Fiona showing off her ass. Good answer, however, it's not a match.

1745
02:05:09,180 --> 02:05:13,620
My answer, did I get everybody else? No. Oh, I'm sorry, Magus. Oh, he's hiding behind me.

1746
02:05:13,620 --> 02:05:17,420
I had to kind of go... Well, how's that match? Because the first time I saw Fiona, she was

1747
02:05:17,420 --> 02:05:21,620
showing her ass off through her skirt. Oh, okay. Then that's a point. Yay, they get a

1748
02:05:21,620 --> 02:05:27,300
point each. All right. All right. I had to go... I have a point and a half each. I had

1749
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:31,500
to go with the longest one. Magus, her collection of turning picks is never complete without

Don't say the same thing. That's not how you break a tie.

That's true. Yeah, it might be true.

02:09:39,340 --> 02:09:41,340
Skinny white cunt!

1810
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:43,340
I thought so.

1811
02:09:46,340 --> 02:09:48,340
Oh!

1812
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:50,340
Wait, Fiona's not white.

1813
02:09:52,340 --> 02:09:55,340
Oh, was that my outer monologue? I thought that was my inner voice.

1814
02:09:55,340 --> 02:09:57,340
Is this white, or pink?

1815
02:09:57,340 --> 02:09:59,340
This whole weekend?

1816
02:09:59,340 --> 02:10:07,340
Wait, wait, excuse me! Nobody saw this, but I just got hit by the door three times! My ass got hit by the door three times, thank you!

1817
02:10:07,340 --> 02:10:08,340
Okay, quick question.

1818
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:09,340
After you go through the door.

1819
02:10:09,340 --> 02:10:11,340
Quick, quick question.

1820
02:10:11,340 --> 02:10:16,340
Female Asians with big breasts, man-made or myth?

1821
02:10:16,340 --> 02:10:17,340
Next time, Jerry, bring it.

1822
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:20,340
I think we should go on to our next answer.

1823
02:10:20,340 --> 02:10:24,340
Oh yeah, mine was dead babies, because nobody probably heard that.

1824
02:10:24,340 --> 02:10:25,340
Or we forgot, I don't know.

1825
02:10:25,340 --> 02:10:28,340
I had to go for the obligatory. Propel!

1826
02:10:28,340 --> 02:10:29,340
Yes!

1827
02:10:29,340 --> 02:10:37,060
No, you are up by one point, so if I said Propel, we go to another tiebreaker round.

1828
02:10:37,060 --> 02:10:40,820
If I said Big Black Cock, Angel's going to win by a lead.

1829
02:10:40,820 --> 02:10:42,220
Angel gets a Big Black Cock.

1830
02:10:42,220 --> 02:10:50,420
My answer was, on Orange Lounge, we talk about Ted DDR.

1831
02:10:50,420 --> 02:10:51,660
Angel wins!

1832
02:10:51,660 --> 02:10:54,580
Angel, go get a handful of Jamie's Big Nuts.

1833
02:10:54,580 --> 02:10:57,060
That's your prize.

1834
02:10:57,060 --> 02:10:58,060
Just get your hand in there.

1835
02:10:58,060 --> 02:11:02,660
justice all yes to them all up now with them put it in your mouth

1836
02:11:02,660 --> 02:11:07,340
it

1837
02:11:07,340 --> 02:11:09,620
you know you want to suck it all come on

1838
02:11:09,620 --> 02:11:12,020
michael gogo

1839
02:11:12,020 --> 02:11:16,460
all she's getting

1840
02:11:16,460 --> 02:11:20,180
you hot for her to handle

1841
02:11:20,180 --> 02:11:22,840
he's got a mouthful enough

1842
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:24,040
All right, that's it.

1843
02:11:24,040 --> 02:11:26,240
And once again, my nuts are safe for consumption.

1844
02:11:26,240 --> 02:11:29,200
We're going to go.

1845
02:11:29,200 --> 02:11:34,040
And with that, I think that we have a very appropriate song

1846
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:35,640
here to be playing.

1847
02:11:35,640 --> 02:11:38,280
It's going to be called Cramming for College.

1848
02:11:38,280 --> 02:11:43,920
So do enjoy.

1849
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:44,600
All right, enjoy.

1850
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:47,240
This is our next break music, because Loki wants to hear it.

1851
02:11:47,240 --> 02:11:48,720
This is called Cramming for College.

1852
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:49,320
Yes?

1853
02:11:49,320 --> 02:11:50,200
Public announcement.

1854
02:11:50,200 --> 02:11:52,280
I think I just pissed myself.

1855
02:11:52,280 --> 02:11:53,540
Okay.

1856
02:11:53,540 --> 02:11:56,160
You smell funny.

1857
02:11:56,160 --> 02:11:58,040
I'm so scared I sold my armor.

1858
02:11:58,040 --> 02:12:01,760
All right. I hope you enjoyed the match game. We'll be right back. If you want to send us an email,

1859
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:05,400
OrangeLawnTradioYahoo.com, if you have more questions for us. In the meantime, we have to tabulate the votes.

1860
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:08,720
In the meantime, we've got to tabulate the votes. We'll do that during this break for the cage

1861
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:11,800
match, and we will be right back.

1862
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:16,200
Okay, class. Our final exam will be coming up at the end of this week. Our final exam will be in

1863
02:12:16,200 --> 02:12:18,160
big black cocks. The test will be comprised of

1864
02:12:18,160 --> 02:12:19,440
twenty percent written,

1865
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:20,900
thirty percent oral,

1866
02:12:20,900 --> 02:12:24,880
and fifty percent anal. Any questions?

1867
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:26,000
Professor?

1868
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,200
Yes, dear?

1869
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:30,080
Will there be any extra credit?

1870
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:32,080
I am so glad you asked.

1871
02:13:00,080 --> 02:13:02,080
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

1872
02:15:00,080 --> 02:15:02,080
I

1873
02:16:00,080 --> 02:16:07,080
I'm the king of the game world We said that I can't do

1874
02:16:07,080 --> 02:16:14,080
Do you believe in love? Yes, I'm the king of the game world

1875
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:21,080
I'm the king of the game world Do you believe in love?

1876
02:16:21,080 --> 02:16:23,080
If you believe in love

1877
02:16:24,240 --> 02:16:26,240
Yes, I'm so big in love

1878
02:16:27,580 --> 02:16:29,580
I'm not your man anymore

1879
02:16:29,940 --> 02:16:31,940
Oh, yes, I'm your power

1880
02:16:31,940 --> 02:16:32,940
Da da da

1881
02:16:32,940 --> 02:16:34,880
Ooh-ooh-ooh

1882
02:16:34,880 --> 02:16:36,880
Da da da

1883
02:16:37,880 --> 02:16:39,880
Don't you think you can't go on?

1884
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:43,280
If you believe in love

1885
02:16:43,280 --> 02:17:06,280
You're standing there with your arms unfolded like a eucalyptus care

1886
02:17:06,280 --> 02:17:12,280
Even before you glanced at me, I already felt the chemistry

1887
02:17:12,280 --> 02:17:17,280
Don't know what it is about you that's got me feelin' right

1888
02:17:17,280 --> 02:17:24,280
I each, I once, let you get away, boy, you're a lucky one

1889
02:17:24,280 --> 02:17:30,280
I don't need you, cause the truth is, got my hands full of fatties

1890
02:17:30,280 --> 02:17:37,280
But I want you, gonna put you at the very, very top of my head

1891
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:42,280
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

1892
02:17:42,280 --> 02:17:46,280
You are all I care

1893
02:17:46,280 --> 02:17:50,280
I want that, that

1894
02:18:00,280 --> 02:18:02,280
I don't need you

1895
02:18:02,280 --> 02:18:04,280
Cause the truth is

1896
02:18:04,280 --> 02:18:06,280
Got my hands full of love that it is

1897
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:12,280
But I want you, gonna put you at the very, very top of my lip

1898
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:19,280
Yeah, I want you, gonna have you, and that's the way it is

1899
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:49,280
Okay, we'll do this. We'll do Paranoid Survivor from the new DDR Extreme, and then we'll come back and we've got a list list for you guys.

1900
02:20:12,280 --> 02:20:38,280
Orange Lounge Radio, will you put your thing down, flip it and reverse it?

1901
02:20:38,280 --> 02:20:43,480
back, Orange Lounge Radio, and everybody is furiously working on their list, because we

1902
02:20:43,480 --> 02:20:49,680
are going to do a list list. But first, I want to announce the winner of the cage match,

1903
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:55,840
very close by the way, this song won, the other two were tied, and this song had one

1904
02:20:55,840 --> 02:21:00,560
vote more than the other two, so it was very close, the winner of this week's cage match

1905
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:02,640
once again, Ayumi Hamasaki with Connected.

1906
02:21:02,640 --> 02:21:14,240
How you doing over there, Jamie?

1907
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:15,640
I'm ready to do the listless.

1908
02:21:15,640 --> 02:21:19,120
You're having that sad, sad spinster look on your face.

1909
02:21:19,120 --> 02:21:24,760
It's because my number three song, I'm trying to imagine, my number three choice, I'm trying

1910
02:21:24,760 --> 02:21:27,400
to imagine what it would be like, because we haven't even announced our listless yet,

1911
02:21:27,400 --> 02:21:28,400
what it's going to be.

1912
02:21:28,400 --> 02:21:29,400
Why don't you tell them?

1913
02:21:29,400 --> 02:21:37,000
Well, we're doing one for top song in any other Bimani game that you would like to see in 2DX.

1914
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:41,320
Usually we do it, you know, what we want in DDR, well screw DDR, we want 2DX.

1915
02:21:41,320 --> 02:21:47,840
Right, and with Extreme you had a bunch of other Bimani songs crossing into DDR, so Jamie thinks we ought to do it the other way around, put them in 2DX.

1916
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:50,920
In fact, I'm actually erasing my number 3 because I'm going to put in something from another game.

1917
02:21:50,920 --> 02:21:57,880
Alright, so if that's the case, then I think we usually, I'll start, I don't use the start, we'll go around, we'll do Jamie last, we'll go around this way.

1918
02:21:57,880 --> 02:21:59,600
Oh fine, thank you.

1919
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:01,920
I'm saving the best for last year.

1920
02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:03,280
Okay, so I'll start.

1921
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:09,440
My number three on this list of songs from another Bomani game that ought to be in 2DX

1922
02:22:09,440 --> 02:22:10,440
that aren't...

1923
02:22:10,440 --> 02:22:12,880
Fireball!

1924
02:22:12,880 --> 02:22:15,400
I think that song would be funny in 2DX.

1925
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:17,280
I could kind of imagine how it would go.

1926
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:21,200
You know, you can only get so much of the trance and Eurobeat stuff.

1927
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:23,280
I'd like to see something a little funky in 2DX.

1928
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:27,440
So Fireball's my number three pick for what ought to be in 2DX from another Bomani game.

1929
02:22:27,440 --> 02:22:32,440
Let's go over to Angel. Your number three choice is... Oh, you only have two so far?

1930
02:22:32,440 --> 02:22:39,440
Actually, yes, that song is on it. Angel's got to think of another one? Okay.

1931
02:22:39,440 --> 02:22:46,440
You had one? All right. Number three choice.

1932
02:22:46,440 --> 02:22:48,440
Uh, Tokyo Already.

1933
02:22:48,440 --> 02:22:50,440
Tokyo Already. That's a pretty good one.

1934
02:22:50,440 --> 02:22:54,440
It's Eurobeat, and Eurobeat's getting big in 2DX.

1935
02:22:54,440 --> 02:22:58,680
Tokyo Already, pretty cool song from Dance Maniacs, right?

1936
02:22:58,680 --> 02:23:01,480
All right, Monkey Dance is already in 2DX, dummy.

1937
02:23:01,480 --> 02:23:05,280
Stressa, your number three pick.

1938
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:08,040
OK, I know it might sound a little hokey,

1939
02:23:08,040 --> 02:23:11,680
but the idea of having Like A Virgin

1940
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:12,920
might be kind of interesting.

1941
02:23:12,920 --> 02:23:16,680
Like A Virgin from Parapara.

1942
02:23:16,680 --> 02:23:20,280
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, I'd want it just for that part.

1943
02:23:20,280 --> 02:23:21,960
That'd be pretty cool.

1944
02:23:21,960 --> 02:23:24,000
Mm-hmm.

1945
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Did you already go, Jamie?

1946
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
We're going around this way.

1947
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:31,000
My number three, badly, is Superstar.

1948
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Superstar!

1949
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
I knew you were going to think about that one.

1950
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Superstar. Loki.

1951
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:43,000
This is one of my favorite Dance Maniacs tracks. It's Mind Parasite.

1952
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Mind Parasite, interesting choice.

1953
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
From Dance Maniacs. Jamie, you're number three.

1954
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
You said you were going... I was going to ask.

1955
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Yeah, you are.

1956
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:57,000
I pick On the Jazz.

1957
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:58,000
On the Jazz?

1958
02:23:58,000 --> 02:23:59,000
Interesting one.

1959
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Why On the Jazz?

1960
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Just because it would be fun to play all the sax line in it.

1961
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:07,800
I mean, you think about how San Malete went with all the horn parts.

1962
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:08,800
Yeah?

1963
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:09,800
Interesting choice.

1964
02:24:09,800 --> 02:24:10,800
I wouldn't have guessed.

1965
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:12,040
I didn't even think you liked that song.

1966
02:24:12,040 --> 02:24:13,040
I do.

1967
02:24:13,040 --> 02:24:14,040
I'm kind of surprised you put it.

1968
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:15,040
Okay, cool.

1969
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:16,040
Well, that's cool.

1970
02:24:16,040 --> 02:24:17,040
Good for you, Jamie.

1971
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:18,040
All right.

1972
02:24:18,040 --> 02:24:19,040
Number two picks.

1973
02:24:19,040 --> 02:24:41,040
I'm going to get Hell from Jamie, but I chose Dark Black Forest as my second choice.

1974
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:43,040
Black Forest.

1975
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:46,400
I don't hate the song, it's just overplayed.

1976
02:24:46,400 --> 02:24:48,040
I would have to agree with that.

1977
02:24:48,040 --> 02:24:50,760
Dark Black Forest should be in 2DX.

1978
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:51,600
Stress out.

1979
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:54,000
My second choice, why?

1980
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,240
Because I love the beats.

1981
02:24:56,240 --> 02:24:57,400
Boom Boom Dollar.

1982
02:24:57,400 --> 02:24:59,360
Boom Boom Dollar.

1983
02:24:59,360 --> 02:25:02,480
Oh my god, Boom Boom Dollar in 2DX.

1984
02:25:02,480 --> 02:25:03,920
I'm completely sad and pathetic.

1985
02:25:03,920 --> 02:25:05,880
Would be fucking hilarious.

1986
02:25:05,880 --> 02:25:06,680
Have mercy.

1987
02:25:06,680 --> 02:25:08,880
Gee, I thought it was going to be Bumblebee.

1988
02:25:08,880 --> 02:25:10,200
That would be fucking funny.

1989
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:14,200
I'm sorry. I give it a point for comic value. Brad!

1990
02:25:14,200 --> 02:25:16,200
What? What?

1991
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:18,200
Nothing. Dave was just making a joke.

1992
02:25:18,200 --> 02:25:21,200
He said that he was going to burn his PS2 to the ground if that was on.

1993
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:27,200
Then I'd be like, yes, and then I'd take the ashes and let it rise like a phoenix back into a PS2 and then I'd play it.

1994
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:29,200
Brad, you're number two big.

1995
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:32,200
Well, thanks for the comedy killer.

1996
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:38,200
My number two big is Ecstasy, because that song kicks ass and owns you all.

1997
02:25:38,200 --> 02:25:41,320
It'd be like having insertion.

1998
02:25:41,320 --> 02:25:42,320
Ecstasy.

1999
02:25:42,320 --> 02:25:43,320
Loki.

2000
02:25:43,320 --> 02:25:47,800
Well, it's only fitting since, you know, if we're talking about a new mix of 2DX, it would

2001
02:25:47,800 --> 02:25:52,640
obviously be with the new mix of DDR, so why not the Legend of Max?

2002
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:54,640
Legend of Max.

2003
02:25:54,640 --> 02:25:55,880
My fingers would fall off.

2004
02:25:55,880 --> 02:25:57,880
My turn, my turn, my turn.

2005
02:25:57,880 --> 02:25:58,880
It feels like burning.

2006
02:25:58,880 --> 02:25:59,880
Jamie, you're number two.

2007
02:25:59,880 --> 02:26:01,660
It feels like burning heat.

2008
02:26:01,660 --> 02:26:02,880
My baby mama.

2009
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:04,120
My baby mama.

2010
02:26:04,120 --> 02:26:05,120
Yes.

2011
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:08,120
I'm thinking about playing the bass line with that.

2012
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:38,240
That's fine. We can have a dupe. That's fine.

2013
02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:40,580
Angel.

2014
02:26:40,580 --> 02:26:43,640
Okay, this is my personal favorite at the moment.

2015
02:26:43,640 --> 02:26:45,320
I chose Eurobeat.

2016
02:26:45,320 --> 02:26:47,300
Eurobeat, go!

2017
02:26:47,300 --> 02:26:51,780
Well, 6 style had a lot of pair of songs in it, so Eurobeat would definitely fit in.

2018
02:26:51,780 --> 02:26:53,060
So Eurobeat.

2019
02:26:53,060 --> 02:26:55,240
Angel's number one choice.

2020
02:26:55,240 --> 02:26:58,800
Well, since we talked about... Oh, I'm being told that

2021
02:26:58,800 --> 02:27:01,600
Gamlande Couples in Beatmania the final.

2022
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:03,240
Can somebody give me...

2023
02:27:03,240 --> 02:27:09,100
oh yeah that's our talk about two d x not be made not five t two d x haha

2024
02:27:09,100 --> 02:27:10,100
that's right thank you

2025
02:27:10,100 --> 02:27:12,880
i didn't know that that's still pretty cool if it's in uh...

2026
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:16,480
even in the final but that's not to the x

2027
02:27:16,480 --> 02:27:18,440
my first

2028
02:27:18,440 --> 02:27:20,640
since we talked about

2029
02:27:20,640 --> 02:27:22,480
let's talk about some pretty

2030
02:27:22,480 --> 02:27:25,760
beginning it is into the exercise

2031
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:27,600
what's all that

2032
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:31,080
yes sucks to be me

2033
02:27:31,080 --> 02:27:34,360
Let me think some more.

2034
02:27:34,360 --> 02:27:35,820
All right, we'll come back to Starza.

2035
02:27:35,820 --> 02:27:36,320
Oops.

2036
02:27:36,320 --> 02:27:37,160
He's not doing it.

2037
02:27:37,160 --> 02:27:38,080
I forgot.

2038
02:27:38,080 --> 02:27:39,360
I'll stick to my game face.

2039
02:27:39,360 --> 02:27:42,320
OK, my number one and the best song in the world,

2040
02:27:42,320 --> 02:27:44,320
the Miracle Moon remix by LED.

2041
02:27:44,320 --> 02:27:46,760
Which was in BeatMania as well, but it needs to be in 2DX.

2042
02:27:46,760 --> 02:27:49,080
It needs to be in 2DX with harder notes and stuff.

2043
02:27:49,080 --> 02:27:50,800
That would be awesome.

2044
02:27:50,800 --> 02:27:52,240
I would jizz in my panties.

2045
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:53,720
Oh, crap.

2046
02:27:53,720 --> 02:27:58,720
I think I'm going to take my noose off now.

2047
02:27:58,720 --> 02:28:07,720
Since Rob was a bastard and stole my number one, I'm going to just pick this really wig

2048
02:28:07,720 --> 02:28:11,720
off one here.

2049
02:28:11,720 --> 02:28:12,720
Kachaka.

2050
02:28:12,720 --> 02:28:13,720
Kachaka.

2051
02:28:13,720 --> 02:28:17,420
I almost picked that.

2052
02:28:17,420 --> 02:28:21,500
I think I spelled Kachaka wrong, but whatever.

2053
02:28:21,500 --> 02:28:28,500
My number one? Clunk Clunk. Clunk Clunk. Oh, good one. Good one from Keyboard Mania. That's

2054
02:28:32,420 --> 02:28:37,700
a good pick. Did Stressa come up with one? How about Captain Jack? Captain Jack! Because

2055
02:28:37,700 --> 02:28:41,700
no Bomani game is complete without Captain Jack. Beautiful. And if he wasn't there, he'd

2056
02:28:41,700 --> 02:28:48,700
i

2057
02:28:52,320 --> 02:28:55,960
okay so dang jamie read this list so far as it stands

2058
02:28:55,960 --> 02:28:59,480
fireball Tokyo already like a virgin superstar my parasite

2059
02:28:59,480 --> 02:29:02,720
on the jazz ghost dark black forest boom boom dollar

2060
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:06,900
as to see legend of max was it saying

2061
02:29:06,900 --> 02:29:07,960
is misspelled

2062
02:29:07,960 --> 02:29:10,480
because i did its twice it's the grammer check okay

2063
02:29:10,480 --> 02:29:23,480
Legend of Max, My Baby Mama, Guacamole de Couple, Eurobeat, Miracle Moon LED Mix, Cachaca, Clone Clone 1655, and Captain Jack.

2064
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:45,240
elimination round where one song, sorry kids, it's gotta come off this list. This is a hard

2065
02:29:45,240 --> 02:29:52,640
one. I guess I'll start. One song that's gotta come off this list for 2DX that I don't wanna

2066
02:29:52,640 --> 02:30:02,640
see in 2DX. Boom Boom Dollar. That's forever and always a DDR song. I don't see it in 2DX,

2067
02:30:02,640 --> 02:30:07,120
sorry. So I'm taking Boom Boom Dollar off the list. Angel, take one of these songs off

2068
02:30:07,120 --> 02:30:18,120
The Guacamole List song.

2069
02:30:18,120 --> 02:30:21,120
Oh, damn you, damn you!

2070
02:30:21,120 --> 02:30:24,120
Why? Because I don't know it. My bad.

2071
02:30:24,120 --> 02:30:26,120
We should play that during the break, man.

2072
02:30:26,120 --> 02:30:28,120
You're a bad woman.

2073
02:30:28,120 --> 02:30:30,120
Rob, I just heard the news.

2074
02:30:30,120 --> 02:30:34,120
I heard that you have a bad case of balloon fight.

2075
02:30:34,120 --> 02:30:38,120
I've heard that Pim can cure this, along with Sega.

2076
02:30:38,120 --> 02:30:41,120
Sega!

2077
02:30:41,120 --> 02:30:44,120
What are you doing here?

2078
02:30:44,120 --> 02:30:47,120
Molesting you, apparently.

2079
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:49,120
Sonic!

2080
02:30:49,120 --> 02:30:51,120
Okay, let's see here. Fireball took you already, like a virgin.

2081
02:30:51,120 --> 02:30:53,120
Superstar mind parasite, I'm the jazz.

2082
02:30:53,120 --> 02:30:56,120
Ghost, dark black forest, ecstasy, legend of Max.

2083
02:30:56,120 --> 02:30:59,120
My baby mama, Eurobeat.

2084
02:30:59,120 --> 02:31:01,120
Eurobeat?

2085
02:31:01,120 --> 02:31:03,120
Miracle moon.

2086
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:05,120
What the hell is that?

2087
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:07,120
T'Chaka!

2088
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:11,120
Clung Clung 1655 and Captain Jack. Captain Jack.

2089
02:31:11,120 --> 02:31:14,120
I'll tell you what, here we go. Just delete everything except Captain Jack.

2090
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:16,120
And it's all set.

2091
02:31:16,120 --> 02:31:18,120
Yes, Captain Jack is loved.

2092
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:20,120
Alright.

2093
02:31:20,120 --> 02:31:24,120
Moving along. Stressa, what comes off the list?

2094
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:29,120
I'm sorry, Angel, but Dark Black Forest must go.

2095
02:31:29,120 --> 02:31:31,120
It's all good. I don't hate you.

2096
02:31:31,120 --> 02:32:00,120
much. You'll get a beating later. I do. Jerk. Alright. Badly. I want to go last. Tough. I want a pony. Anyway. I don't want to piss anybody off because I'll take mine away. I'm going to have to go with Captain Jack. You bastard taking Captain Jack off the list. I hope you die. That's alright. Stressa. I'm just kidding. As payback for you taking

2097
02:32:00,120 --> 02:32:07,120
For you taking off my song from the list, I still say you're a DIRTY KILLGIRL!

2098
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:17,120
Just because I'm not a huge fan of this song in both DDR and Beatmania, buh-bye Miracle

2099
02:32:17,120 --> 02:32:18,120
Moon.

2100
02:32:18,120 --> 02:32:23,120
You will rot in hell for this!

2101
02:32:23,120 --> 02:32:24,120
Miracle Moon comes off the list.

2102
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:48,200
I think I'm going to have to go with taking off Eurobeat, just because as far as having

2103
02:32:48,200 --> 02:32:51,200
Eurobeat song goes in 2DX, that wouldn't be much of a challenge.

2104
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:56,200
Alright, so... It doesn't have a lot of neat, synth-y stuff going on.

2105
02:32:56,200 --> 02:33:01,200
So, we have the final list that our chat room now gets to vote on.

Ghost, Estacy, Legend of Max, My Baby Mama, Kachaka, and CloneKling6035.

2110
02:33:16,200 --> 02:33:20,680

It turns out that we're so

2120
02:37:10,580 --> 02:37:11,580
Rising

2121
02:37:11,580 --> 02:37:13,980
Summer level up

2122
02:37:13,980 --> 02:37:15,280
Tell me what we are

2123
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:16,480
Feeling

Summer level up

2125
02:37:18,780 --> 02:37:23,080
I'm the one in love with you, boy

2126
02:37:23,080 --> 02:37:26,080
Do do do do do do do do do

2127

So now when the air jumps

2128
02:37:32,080 --> 02:37:33,080
So now when the air jumps

2129
02:37:33,080 --> 02:37:35,580
Jumper jumpers grab my knees and stop now

2130
02:37:35,580 --> 02:37:36,580
Feel like I'm your girl

2131
02:37:36,580 --> 02:37:37,880
Enjoying the place you got

2132
02:37:37,880 --> 02:37:40,380
But something's not for treat, it's just a bit summer now

2133
02:37:40,380 --> 02:37:42,380
Summer la-la-la

2134
02:37:42,380 --> 02:37:44,880
Can you hear my heartbeat?

2135
02:37:44,880 --> 02:37:46,880
Summer la-la-la

2136
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:49,880
A rhythm that I repeat

2137
02:37:49,880 --> 02:37:51,880
Summer la-la-la

2138
02:37:51,880 --> 02:37:54,880
Can you hear my heartbeat?

2139
02:37:54,880 --> 02:37:56,880
Summer la-la-la

2140
02:37:56,880 --> 02:38:00,880
I know I'm in love with you

2141
02:39:26,880 --> 02:39:30,480
But I like it, but I like it forever

2142
02:39:56,880 --> 02:40:21,000
Bye bye baby balloon Bye bye baby balloon

2143
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:35,180
Bitch, get a new song, an open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

2144
02:40:35,180 --> 02:40:37,180
We are back and I'm having my picture taken.

2145
02:40:37,180 --> 02:40:38,900
Oh, there, that was fun.

2146
02:40:38,900 --> 02:40:39,900
All right.

2147
02:40:39,900 --> 02:40:40,900
Whee!

2148
02:40:40,900 --> 02:40:44,080
Hey, I got flashed by Angel, that was pretty cool.

2149
02:40:44,080 --> 02:40:47,300
We have the results, ladies and gentlemen of The Listless.

2150
02:40:47,300 --> 02:40:53,500
from any other Bamani game that ought to be in 2DX that isn't yet. And here it is, the

2151
02:40:53,500 --> 02:40:57,820
number three choice, you voted Superstar!

2152
02:40:57,820 --> 02:41:00,820
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

2153
02:41:00,820 --> 02:41:02,820
No, Brad, can't you do the rap? Can you do the rap for us?

2154
02:41:02,820 --> 02:41:08,100
Don't make me bust out my white honky rap skills on yellow ass.

2155
02:41:08,100 --> 02:41:09,180
Come on, Emma Brad.

2156
02:41:09,180 --> 02:41:11,860
I don't even remember how it goes.

2157
02:41:11,860 --> 02:41:12,860
My name is Kaos, and I'm-

2158
02:41:12,860 --> 02:41:13,860
No, wait.

2159
02:41:13,860 --> 02:41:14,860
That's all I remember.

2160
02:41:14,860 --> 02:41:15,860
I am here, and my name is Kaos.

2161
02:41:15,860 --> 02:41:16,860
Whatever.

2162
02:41:16,860 --> 02:41:22,140
This happens to me like VD is to Amadeus.

2163
02:41:22,140 --> 02:41:24,540
Anyway, number two pick.

2164
02:41:24,540 --> 02:41:25,300
You picked it.

2165
02:41:25,300 --> 02:41:28,660
The number two winner is clunkclunk1655.

2166
02:41:28,660 --> 02:41:29,180
I'm winner.

2167
02:41:29,180 --> 02:41:30,580
Winner.

2168
02:41:30,580 --> 02:41:32,460
Keyboard mania in the house.

2169
02:41:32,460 --> 02:41:35,500
Ought to be on VDR, or ought to be on 2DX.

2170
02:41:35,500 --> 02:41:37,300
And the winner.

2171
02:41:37,300 --> 02:41:38,940
This kind of makes me sad a little bit,

2172
02:41:38,940 --> 02:41:40,700
because I know it'll be in 2DX anyway.

2173
02:41:40,700 --> 02:41:43,260
But you did vote it, your number one choice,

2174
02:41:43,260 --> 02:41:45,480
by quite a landslide, ladies and gentlemen.

2175
02:41:45,480 --> 02:41:47,640
legend of max

2176
02:41:47,640 --> 02:41:51,080

2177
02:41:51,080 --> 02:41:55,260

2182
02:42:07,760 --> 02:42:09,680

don't give me dots

2185
02:42:12,640 --> 02:42:13,920

2195
02:42:31,800 --> 02:42:35,660
you know kinda like fine it'll be called legend of let them move

2197
02:42:40,460 --> 02:42:44,580

2198
02:42:44,580 --> 02:42:46,820
how about uh...

2199
02:42:46,820 --> 02:42:49,960
pass was raised again

2200
02:42:49,960 --> 02:42:54,240
parents rage wins

2201
02:42:54,240 --> 02:42:59,220
i think the man from drink out that that's going to be rated

2202
02:42:59,220 --> 02:43:03,020
is he going to grow from a mushroom

2203
02:43:03,020 --> 02:43:05,420
as you take the mushrooms you'll see it grow

2204
02:43:05,420 --> 02:43:09,260
you know it's that he knows what he is you're going to that guy c man and he

2205
02:43:09,260 --> 02:43:11,260
He ends up being a boss in a Konami game.

2206
02:43:11,260 --> 02:43:13,260
What is up with that, you know?

2207
02:43:13,260 --> 02:43:19,260
Doesn't that guy from Seaman look just like the boss that's in Contra, the new Contra game?

2208
02:43:19,260 --> 02:43:21,260
Yeah, the shriveled space game.

2209
02:43:21,260 --> 02:43:24,260
Ooh, I'm coming undone. Ah, ah, ah, ah.

2210
02:43:24,260 --> 02:43:26,260
Talking about that fish.

2211
02:43:26,260 --> 02:43:29,260
I got it all over the ground.

2212
02:43:29,260 --> 02:43:34,260
They're suggesting in the chatroom that Rob's voice the game, Slut Edition.

2213
02:43:34,260 --> 02:43:41,740
I don't know what y'all got against politics, shit ass!

2214
02:43:41,740 --> 02:43:46,460
Gumby says pantsless sky voice game, no, hell no!

2215
02:43:46,460 --> 02:43:47,460
Hell no.

2216
02:43:47,460 --> 02:43:49,020
I thought you wanted to show off your cock.

2217
02:43:49,020 --> 02:43:53,620
Only in a freestyle routine, I'm not gonna show off my cock, what are you talking about?

2218
02:43:53,620 --> 02:43:56,880
That's just radio, that's radio funny, oh you weren't here for that.

2219
02:43:56,880 --> 02:44:00,780
I said why doesn't anybody in a GDR freestyle routine whip out their cock at the end of

2220
02:44:00,780 --> 02:44:01,780
it?

2221
02:44:01,780 --> 02:44:04,780
Everyone knows you're just a big ol' slut.

2222
02:44:04,780 --> 02:44:05,780
Haha.

2223
02:44:05,780 --> 02:44:07,780
What? I'm sorry, all I heard was nails.

2224
02:44:07,780 --> 02:44:10,780
Why does everybody think I'm a slut? I haven't gotten laid in forever.

2225
02:44:10,780 --> 02:44:11,780
Do you all think I'm a slut?

2226
02:44:11,780 --> 02:44:13,780
Slut? Slut? What?

2227
02:44:13,780 --> 02:44:14,780
Ugh.

2228
02:44:14,780 --> 02:44:16,780
Aw, here you go again.

2229
02:44:16,780 --> 02:44:18,780
Okay, capin' on Paul Terre.

2230
02:44:18,780 --> 02:44:19,780
One of the most...

2231
02:44:19,780 --> 02:44:20,780
She is the most...

2232
02:44:20,780 --> 02:44:21,780
The most...

2233
02:44:21,780 --> 02:44:22,780
Slutty?

2234
02:44:22,780 --> 02:44:23,780
Wait, no, no, no, no!

2235
02:44:23,780 --> 02:44:26,780
She's the most talented musician in the world.

2236
02:44:26,780 --> 02:44:28,780
Ever.

2237
02:44:28,780 --> 02:44:31,780
Yeah, too bad she's Naoki.

2238
02:44:31,780 --> 02:44:34,780
Is this before or after she gave you a blowjob?

2239
02:44:34,780 --> 02:44:43,780
She may be the most talented musician in the world, but she's not talented at music. She's talented in other ways, she's just also a musician.

2240
02:44:43,780 --> 02:44:46,780
That may be so.

2241
02:44:46,780 --> 02:44:50,780
They're having a group orgy! It's Hybro Uroby, the group orgy, okay?

2242
02:44:50,780 --> 02:44:57,780
You've got, you know, the DDR All-Stars, which is basically, you know, B4U, you know, all them buck naked, freakin' just gettin' freaky.

2243
02:44:57,780 --> 02:45:04,780
And then you've got, then you've got Politary in the mix there, and some other chick that we don't remember her name because she doesn't really matter, because they all suck.

2244
02:45:04,780 --> 02:45:09,780
And then, ew, the Naoki's in there. Oh, screw Naoki, he can be out of the, he can be filming.

2245
02:45:09,780 --> 02:45:12,780
I'm sorry, I think Jenny Rom's a bigger slut than Politary.

2246
02:45:12,780 --> 02:45:15,780
We already know that half of B4U is really Naoki, too.

2247
02:45:15,780 --> 02:45:19,780
Have you heard the new Polteri song where she plays the didgeridoo?

2248
02:45:19,780 --> 02:45:23,780
Come on, guys! She's Australian! Fucking kill my joke!

2249
02:45:23,780 --> 02:45:27,780
There's been a sniper shooting!

2250
02:45:27,780 --> 02:45:31,780
Okay, she stopped doing the didgeridoo sound after I...

2251
02:45:31,780 --> 02:45:35,780
Ah! I like Black Lab's term

2252
02:45:35,780 --> 02:45:39,780
for Polteri. Ostrasion.

2253
02:45:39,780 --> 02:45:43,780
She's Ostrasion.

2254
02:45:43,780 --> 02:45:54,940
oh god they're criticizing me because we've said slut like 20 times and

2255
02:45:54,940 --> 02:45:57,540
haven't played the

2256
02:45:57,540 --> 02:46:04,540
I thought she needed to be pressed, Rob.

2257
02:46:04,540 --> 02:46:11,540
We banned her from the remainder of the year.

2258
02:46:11,540 --> 02:46:14,540
Alright, that's enough.

2259
02:46:14,540 --> 02:46:21,540
We hate politics, and we want politics.

2260
02:46:21,540 --> 02:46:23,540
We banned her from the remainders of the year.

2261
02:46:24,540 --> 02:46:25,540
Alright, that's enough.

2262
02:46:25,540 --> 02:46:28,540
Because we hate Paula Terry and we want all of her balls to die.

2263
02:46:28,540 --> 02:46:35,540
I don't know what, this chat room is obsessed with my cock and me giving lap dances and me being a slut and like all this other stuff.

2264
02:46:40,540 --> 02:46:41,540
This is scary.

2265
02:46:41,540 --> 02:46:42,540
I need the chat room's help.

2266
02:46:42,540 --> 02:46:44,540
Why would you call Matt a slut? He's a bigger slut than I am.

2267
02:46:44,540 --> 02:46:45,540
I am.

2268
02:46:45,540 --> 02:46:46,540
Say it again.

2269
02:46:46,540 --> 02:46:47,540
Yeah, I'm sorry.

2270
02:46:47,540 --> 02:46:48,540
What?

2271
02:46:48,540 --> 02:47:02,780
Well, he is correct, but that's not the point, okay?

2272
02:47:02,780 --> 02:47:05,140
I am the biggest slut of them all.

2273
02:47:05,140 --> 02:47:08,460
Oh, sorry, Rob.

2274
02:47:08,460 --> 02:47:15,100
All your sluts are blunt to us.

2275
02:47:15,100 --> 02:47:18,500
I'm just going to do the hotkey here.

2276
02:47:18,500 --> 02:47:27,720
Hey, hey, they have loose slop in Reno.

2277
02:47:27,720 --> 02:47:32,460
Tricked you, almost got you, I thought I was going to say slut, but.

2278
02:47:32,460 --> 02:47:37,460
They need to change it, still you're in my part.

2279
02:47:37,460 --> 02:47:44,460
Let's see, in the chat room, they're saying Matt is not a slut, he's a one-woman man whore.

2280
02:47:44,460 --> 02:47:45,460
That's cute.

2281
02:47:45,460 --> 02:47:46,460
I still...

2282
02:47:46,460 --> 02:47:47,460
Ah.

2283
02:47:47,460 --> 02:47:49,460
The song should be called...

2284
02:47:49,460 --> 02:47:54,460
SoCalKicks suggest Dave is a slut to his hand.

2285
02:47:54,460 --> 02:47:59,460
Yes, Jamie.

2286
02:47:59,460 --> 02:48:06,460
Here's a slut to the Crisco can.

2287
02:48:11,180 --> 02:48:13,860
Crisco doesn't work!

2288
02:48:13,860 --> 02:48:17,880
What the hell are you talking about? What would you suggest, being the expert on the show?

2289
02:48:17,880 --> 02:48:23,780
I don't know, saliva.

2290
02:48:23,780 --> 02:48:27,260
Here's my opinion on the whole thing. God, I can't believe we finally brought this on the show.

2291
02:48:27,260 --> 02:48:30,260
It's over. Welcome to the last episode of Orange Wilder, buddy.

2292
02:48:30,760 --> 02:48:32,260
Bomani what? DDR what?

2293
02:48:32,760 --> 02:48:34,260
Okay, well let's see here.

2294
02:48:34,760 --> 02:48:39,260
See, the thing that really sucks about all those freaking loops is they get sticky after a while, okay?

2295
02:48:39,760 --> 02:48:40,760
That just sucks, okay?

2296
02:48:41,260 --> 02:48:43,260
Okay, no more masturbation chat.

2297
02:48:43,760 --> 02:48:45,760
We need Mr. Spanky for this.

2298
02:48:47,760 --> 02:48:53,260
Okay, you just get two Ziploc bags, you fill them with hot water, and you tape them together so they're kind of like a little, you know, and then you just...

2299
02:48:53,260 --> 02:49:02,540
What was that, Jamie? That was a C-bomb! Oh! Did the delay get that?

2300
02:49:02,540 --> 02:49:06,380
I don't know if the mics got it or what. We don't have a delay. We're a shitty radio,

2301
02:49:06,380 --> 02:49:13,100
remember? That was beautiful, Jamie. That was so awesome.

2302
02:49:13,100 --> 02:49:15,860
Remember, folks, the FCC does not approve of Orange Lounge Radio.

2303
02:49:15,860 --> 02:49:25,300
fucking fcc with chrisco's sticky lube

2304
02:49:25,300 --> 02:49:29,580
it's all about the ziploc bags in the water

2305
02:49:29,580 --> 02:49:32,260
two ziploc bags, this sounds like

2306
02:49:32,260 --> 02:49:33,340
we have a slut call

2307
02:49:33,340 --> 02:49:42,780
and for the record i said like a big ol' cut

2308
02:49:42,780 --> 02:49:47,200
Okay, we have a suggestion from the chat room that we need to change the topic, and we should

2309
02:49:47,200 --> 02:49:48,700
talk about cake.

2310
02:49:48,700 --> 02:49:52,380
Frankly, I think cake makes a crappy lube.

2311
02:49:52,380 --> 02:49:54,620
Frosting, maybe.

2312
02:49:54,620 --> 02:50:00,780
You can do so many fun things with frosting.

2313
02:50:00,780 --> 02:50:02,780
There's the butter spray.

2314
02:50:02,780 --> 02:50:10,780
Of course, I think that we should actually get the tips from the people who actually

2315
02:50:10,780 --> 02:50:13,220
We have cocks.

2316
02:50:13,220 --> 02:50:27,700
What they really need is to coat your cock in teflon, okay?

2317
02:50:27,700 --> 02:50:30,140
Cuz nothing will stick to it, is that why they need it?

2318
02:50:30,140 --> 02:50:31,140
Exactly!

2319
02:50:31,140 --> 02:50:33,540
But how do they get teflon to stick to your dick if nothing sticks to teflon?

2320
02:50:33,540 --> 02:50:34,820
Well how do they do it with pots?

2321
02:50:34,820 --> 02:50:35,820
Shit man, how do they do it there?

2322
02:50:35,820 --> 02:50:36,820
You know what?

2323
02:50:36,820 --> 02:50:39,820
Okay, okay, okay.

2324
02:50:39,820 --> 02:50:44,820
Just cock stroking chat. You're all a bunch of cock masters.

2325
02:50:44,820 --> 02:50:46,820
I resent that.

2326
02:50:46,820 --> 02:50:48,820
You're not the master of your cock?

2327
02:50:48,820 --> 02:50:51,820
I want to talk about that Joan soda you had the other day, Rob.

2328
02:50:51,820 --> 02:50:53,820
Hi.

2329
02:50:53,820 --> 02:50:55,820
Nice cock.

2330
02:50:55,820 --> 02:50:57,820
You're a little...

2331
02:50:57,820 --> 02:50:59,820
Right.

2332
02:50:59,820 --> 02:51:01,820
Oh, speaking of which...

2333
02:51:01,820 --> 02:51:02,820
Oh, we went to get the...

2334
02:51:02,820 --> 02:51:05,820
Oh, Irene, you have the biggest cock here in the room right now.

2335
02:51:05,820 --> 02:51:07,820
Really?

2336
02:51:07,820 --> 02:51:10,820
What do you like to do with your cock?

2337
02:51:10,820 --> 02:51:14,820
Well, I mostly like to masturbate. Sometimes I like to pee.

2338
02:51:14,820 --> 02:51:16,820
With buck futter?

2339
02:51:16,820 --> 02:51:18,820
Yes, sure.

2340
02:51:18,820 --> 02:51:22,820
Buck futter. The day is mine.

2341
02:51:22,820 --> 02:51:25,820
This show went to the toilet about three hours ago.

2342
02:51:25,820 --> 02:51:26,820
Show back.

2343
02:51:26,820 --> 02:51:28,820
I think it went about like 40 episodes ago.

2344
02:51:28,820 --> 02:51:32,820
I have to ask you about the penis, mightier.

2345
02:51:32,820 --> 02:51:35,820
Anal bum covers.

2346
02:51:35,820 --> 02:51:43,300
Oh, maybe they should have like DD or UpCock cam.

2347
02:51:43,300 --> 02:51:46,460
It sounds like something you have to get like a surgery, like you know how when you get

2348
02:51:46,460 --> 02:51:52,320
tested for STDs, they sit there, right in the penal.

2349
02:51:52,320 --> 02:51:53,980
Some of us haven't had to.

2350
02:51:53,980 --> 02:51:55,300
I haven't either, I've heard stories.

2351
02:51:55,300 --> 02:52:01,740
No, it's so funny, once I was at In-N-Out, and my mom thought, yeah, that was funny.

2352
02:52:01,740 --> 02:52:03,180
In-N-Out, cock, get it?

2353
02:52:03,180 --> 02:52:10,740
The person next to us was reading a magazine called Therapist, and the person reading it

2354
02:52:10,740 --> 02:52:14,700
was obviously some therapist who subscribed to the monthly magazine or whatever.

2355
02:52:14,700 --> 02:52:18,220
My mom pointed out, she's like, you know that if you put a space between the first three

2356
02:52:18,220 --> 02:52:24,580
letters, it says The Rapist, and she's just like, oh my God.

2357
02:52:24,580 --> 02:52:29,540
My mom's like, yeah, you'll never look at that word the same again.

2358
02:52:29,540 --> 02:52:32,220
Still you're in those parts.

2359
02:52:32,220 --> 02:52:37,020
No Stylin is doing his typical interesting random comments here in the chatroom and he

2360
02:52:37,020 --> 02:52:40,320
says, who wants to go to DDR camp?

2361
02:52:40,320 --> 02:52:42,220
What the hell would DDR camp be?

2362
02:52:42,220 --> 02:52:44,620
Is that like a...

2363
02:52:44,620 --> 02:52:45,620
I don't know.

2364
02:52:45,620 --> 02:52:48,060
Is this one time at DDR camp?

2365
02:52:48,060 --> 02:52:50,580
Is that like a camp where they're going to kill us all?

2366
02:52:50,580 --> 02:52:56,160
This one time at DDR camp, I played Beat It Mania.

2367
02:52:56,160 --> 02:53:00,740
This one time at DDR camp, they made all the girls wear skirts and then they put cameras

2368
02:53:00,740 --> 02:53:02,740
was in the floor and made them dance.

2369
02:53:02,740 --> 02:53:03,740
Weeee.

2370
02:53:03,740 --> 02:53:04,740
Um.

2371
02:53:04,740 --> 02:53:06,740
I just like, weeee.

2372
02:53:06,740 --> 02:53:12,740
Who would be the first counselor at DDR camp to try and molest somebody?

2373
02:53:12,740 --> 02:53:13,740
Loki.

2374
02:53:13,740 --> 02:53:15,740
Loki has his hand up.

2375
02:53:15,740 --> 02:53:17,740
Uh, I didn't have anything to say.

2376
02:53:17,740 --> 02:53:18,740
Oh, he was volunteering.

2377
02:53:18,740 --> 02:53:21,740
Okay, how many DDR players are hard up for dates?

2378
02:53:21,740 --> 02:53:22,740
All of them.

2379
02:53:22,740 --> 02:53:23,740
Not me.

2380
02:53:23,740 --> 02:53:24,740
Oh, and not you.

2381
02:53:24,740 --> 02:53:25,740
Almost all of them.

2382
02:53:25,740 --> 02:53:26,740
Wait, no, no.

2383
02:53:26,740 --> 02:53:28,740
No, I take that back because now...

2384
02:53:28,740 --> 02:53:31,740
All of them that aren't involved with Orange Lounge. Ha ha ha.

2385
02:53:31,740 --> 02:53:39,740
Okay, I would say that would go towards any females. Obviously I would not want to molest any guys because that's just weird.

2386
02:53:39,740 --> 02:53:41,740
Wait, what? You have a girlfriend?

2387
02:53:41,740 --> 02:53:46,740
Yeah, but this is hypothetical. Hypothetical can't hurt me.

2388
02:53:47,740 --> 02:53:49,740
Not hypothetical, just pathetic.

2389
02:53:51,740 --> 02:53:54,740
I'm hyperpathetical. I'm hyperpathetical, okay?

2390
02:53:55,740 --> 02:53:57,740
Hyperglycemic?

2391
02:53:57,740 --> 02:53:58,740
Telepathetical.

2392
02:53:58,740 --> 02:53:59,740
All right.

2393
02:53:59,740 --> 02:54:00,740
I was telepathetic.

2394
02:54:00,740 --> 02:54:06,820
EOSFVB expresses great disappointment that we went through that whole segment about masturbating

2395
02:54:06,820 --> 02:54:10,980
and didn't bring up lotion, and then says, and then more than Jake says, it puts the

2396
02:54:10,980 --> 02:54:13,180
lotion in its skin and puts it in the basket.

2397
02:54:13,180 --> 02:54:14,860
Well, they didn't really finish.

2398
02:54:14,860 --> 02:54:18,900
They stole the mic from me before I could finish, but yeah, lotion would definitely

2399
02:54:18,900 --> 02:54:19,900
work.

2400
02:54:19,900 --> 02:54:22,140
Actually, that's pretty good.

2401
02:54:22,140 --> 02:54:25,180
It puts the lotion on its skin or it gets the hose again.

2402
02:54:25,180 --> 02:54:26,700
How about a dead baby joke?

2403
02:54:26,700 --> 02:54:28,700
More than the Jake wants us to tell a dead baby joke.

2404
02:54:28,700 --> 02:54:29,700
Alright, here it is.

2405
02:54:29,700 --> 02:54:32,700
How many dead babies does it take to screw in a lightbulb?

2406
02:54:32,700 --> 02:54:33,700
How many?

2407
02:54:33,700 --> 02:54:34,700
None, they're dead!

2408
02:54:34,700 --> 02:54:39,700
Alright, well there's one, I'm just going to read this one from the chatroom.

2409
02:54:39,700 --> 02:54:40,700
What is a dead baby?

2410
02:54:40,700 --> 02:54:41,700
What?

2411
02:54:41,700 --> 02:54:43,700
A baby that is dead.

2412
02:54:43,700 --> 02:54:44,700
That's not funny.

2413
02:54:44,700 --> 02:54:46,700
Why is people laughing?

2414
02:54:46,700 --> 02:54:50,700
More than Jake says, what's the difference between a pile of dead babies and a Corvette?

2415
02:54:50,700 --> 02:54:51,700
What?

2416
02:54:51,700 --> 02:54:53,700
I don't have a Corvette in the garage.

2417
02:54:53,700 --> 02:54:55,700
That's pretty funny.

2418
02:54:55,700 --> 02:54:59,540
Alright, we're getting about to that time where we're going to end the damn show, so

2419
02:54:59,540 --> 02:55:02,140
we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, so let's start with all the

2420
02:55:02,140 --> 02:55:04,340
guests tonight, starting in the back with Dave.

2421
02:55:04,340 --> 02:55:07,580
Dave, what's your final thought of the day?

2422
02:55:07,580 --> 02:55:14,580
Homework sucks. I have school tomorrow. That is bullshit. It's school. Finals are coming.

2423
02:55:16,180 --> 02:55:19,180
Nooooooooooooooo.

2424
02:55:19,180 --> 02:55:24,980
Give me that.

2425
02:55:24,980 --> 02:55:29,980
Okay, I don't quite understand the school system over here. Why would you have finals after a break?

2426
02:55:29,980 --> 02:55:33,980
See, back where I come from, we have finals before we go and vegetate.

2427
02:55:33,980 --> 02:55:34,980
Thank you very much.

2428
02:55:34,980 --> 02:55:39,980
Sorry, sorry. So you can forget everything.

2429
02:55:39,980 --> 02:55:42,980
Apparently he's almost gone.

2430
02:55:42,980 --> 02:55:44,980
Somebody pass the mic to somebody else.

2431
02:55:44,980 --> 02:55:46,980
Brad, what's your final thought of the day?

2432
02:55:46,980 --> 02:55:50,980
My final thought is, what do you get when you cross an owl on a bungee cord?

2433
02:55:50,980 --> 02:55:53,980
My ass!

2434
02:55:53,980 --> 02:55:57,980
I thought you were going to say cunt, fuck, shit, dick, ass, pussy.

2435
02:55:57,980 --> 02:55:58,980
Moving on.

2436
02:55:58,980 --> 02:56:00,920
We haven't gotten to the last part of it.

2437
02:56:00,920 --> 02:56:01,920
Moving on.

2438
02:56:01,920 --> 02:56:02,920
Stress up.

2439
02:56:02,920 --> 02:56:03,920
Your final thought of the day.

2440
02:56:03,920 --> 02:56:08,360
First of all, I would like to thank everybody for making this such a wonderful weekend.

2441
02:56:08,360 --> 02:56:12,160
The experience was very fun.

2442
02:56:12,160 --> 02:56:18,600
And final thought is, huh?

2443
02:56:18,600 --> 02:56:20,420
All right, Angel.

2444
02:56:20,420 --> 02:56:22,960
We need to light Loki's hair on fire.

2445
02:56:22,960 --> 02:56:23,960
Yes.

2446
02:56:23,960 --> 02:56:25,680
light lowkey's hair on fire

2447
02:56:25,680 --> 02:56:27,580

02:56:27,580 --> 02:56:30,360

2460
02:57:06,720 --> 02:57:08,580

2466
02:57:25,840 --> 02:57:28,340
so yeah

2467
02:57:28,340 --> 02:57:30,700
I should start a fund, see

2468
02:57:30,700 --> 02:57:32,860
how many people give me money

2469
02:57:32,860 --> 02:57:34,700
that'd be cool

2470
02:57:34,700 --> 02:57:38,340
I need to get money

2471
02:57:38,340 --> 02:57:41,620
Dave needs to get laid fund

2472
02:57:41,620 --> 02:57:46,200
all money goes towards me to get laid

2473
02:57:46,200 --> 02:57:48,200
For your 18th birthday, we'll take you to the Buddy Ranch.

2474
02:57:48,200 --> 02:57:52,200
Fuck that, man. We can take you to the strip club, okay?

2475
02:57:52,200 --> 02:57:57,200
And most of the chicks there give head when you go into the private dances.

2476
02:57:57,200 --> 02:58:03,200
So I've heard. I've never actually had it happen, but...

2477
02:58:03,200 --> 02:58:05,200
Brad's doing the dancer dance.

2478
02:58:05,200 --> 02:58:06,200
Happy Buddy!

2479
02:58:06,200 --> 02:58:08,200
