1
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,031
[SPEAKER_23]: Message for you, son.

2
00:00:04,451 --> 00:00:05,412
Attention!

3
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:09,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

4
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:16,865
[SPEAKER_25]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

5
00:00:20,522 --> 00:00:23,424
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

6
00:00:23,765 --> 00:00:26,947
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

7
00:00:27,507 --> 00:00:30,229
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

8
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,672
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

9
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:34,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

10
00:00:35,073 --> 00:00:36,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

11
00:00:36,874 --> 00:00:44,320
[SPEAKER_23]: In this episode... Hey, are there any boys down there?

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,042
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the biggest bear you've ever seen, Jingleberry.

13
00:00:47,142 --> 00:00:48,483
[SPEAKER_23]: What's your favorite scoop?

14
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:50,859
[SPEAKER_21]: Showgirls.

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,640
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolute fright.

16
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:53,761
[SPEAKER_21]: What's yours?

17
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:56,483
[SPEAKER_21]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

18
00:00:56,543 --> 00:00:57,784
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't torture yourself.

19
00:00:58,424 --> 00:00:59,264
[SPEAKER_21]: That's my job.

20
00:00:59,345 --> 00:01:01,166
[SPEAKER_23]: Now's the time our sprockets bend me dogs!

21
00:01:01,246 --> 00:01:04,328
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll get you, my pretty.

22
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:05,888
[SPEAKER_10]: And your little dog, too.

23
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:07,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Kung Fu.

24
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:09,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

25
00:01:10,191 --> 00:01:12,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Why did they have to take the word gay?

26
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:16,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody expects a Spanish exposition.

27
00:01:16,395 --> 00:01:17,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you do.

28
00:01:17,836 --> 00:01:18,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes!

29
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:22,057
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura Shut up!

30
00:01:22,237 --> 00:01:22,917
[SPEAKER_17]: Where's my gun?

31
00:01:23,057 --> 00:01:25,018
[SPEAKER_14]: This is my boomstick!

32
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:27,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Sky Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

33
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

34
00:01:32,082 --> 00:01:34,863
[SPEAKER_11]: What kind of warped human being would find that funny?

35
00:01:35,123 --> 00:01:36,504
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lounge Radio

36
00:01:39,048 --> 00:01:45,191
[SPEAKER_03]: You are tuned in to the Bimani Scene's most stylish radio station of all things Bimani.

37
00:01:45,311 --> 00:01:46,491
[SPEAKER_16]: It's cute and lovely.

38
00:01:46,851 --> 00:01:50,633
[SPEAKER_03]: We are live, and this is episode number 27 for January the 5th of 2003.

39
00:01:50,973 --> 00:01:53,274
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

40
00:01:53,634 --> 00:01:58,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me as always are my awesome, wonderful, stupendous, and bouncy co-hosts.

41
00:01:58,737 --> 00:02:02,158
[SPEAKER_03]: In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

42
00:02:02,178 --> 00:02:03,139
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's our bell.

43
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,720
[SPEAKER_03]: In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

44
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:07,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not bouncing.

45
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:09,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the hell you're talking about there.

46
00:02:09,882 --> 00:02:11,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw your chi-chis, they were bouncing.

47
00:02:12,936 --> 00:02:18,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Also with us tonight, holy shit, we have got, seriously, probably the biggest show yet.

48
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,999
[SPEAKER_03]: We have so many people in studio, it is crazy.

49
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:24,540
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the first show of the year and everybody's here to celebrate.

50
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around the room and say hello to everybody.

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,362
[SPEAKER_03]: First up, say hello to the one and only chat room, I think the most active person in the chat room quite possibly, recently.

52
00:02:34,163 --> 00:02:35,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to DDR Angel.

53
00:02:37,544 --> 00:02:40,785
[SPEAKER_03]: And with DDR Angel, it's her bro, say hello to Stressa.

54
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:41,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

55
00:02:43,587 --> 00:02:46,008
[SPEAKER_03]: In the back there is Jabberwocky.

56
00:02:47,108 --> 00:02:48,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I just came into the room for a ruler.

57
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Next to Jabberwocky is 23rd Magus is here in the house.

58
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:57,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo, 2, 3, M up in the his house.

59
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:58,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

60
00:02:58,913 --> 00:02:59,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad's back there.

61
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:05,846
[SPEAKER_03]: and also say hello to Irene.

62
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:07,886
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, Jamie's so amazing.

63
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:09,927
[SPEAKER_15]: She gave us the Harry Potter set.

64
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Harry Potter.

65
00:03:11,788 --> 00:03:12,448
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god.

66
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,468
[SPEAKER_15]: What the hell did you just say?

67
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:18,769
[SPEAKER_03]: We do not have enough microphones to cover all this shit going on in here tonight.

68
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:21,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell, Rob doesn't have enough flows to cover what's going on tonight.

69
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,031
[SPEAKER_15]: Come see me when you're not busy, Jamie.

70
00:03:25,251 --> 00:03:27,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we may have monkey sex.

71
00:03:28,092 --> 00:03:31,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Rob is not wearing any pants, thus my need for a ruler.

72
00:03:33,934 --> 00:03:34,334
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

73
00:03:35,135 --> 00:03:35,836
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to come back.

74
00:03:35,856 --> 00:03:36,737
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a huge show.

75
00:03:36,877 --> 00:03:41,261
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got interviews from the SoCal trip Loki and I took over the weekend.

76
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:44,043
[SPEAKER_03]: We might do match game live in studio tonight.

77
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:44,764
[SPEAKER_03]: And my nuts.

78
00:03:45,244 --> 00:03:46,526
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've got Jamie's nuts.

79
00:03:46,706 --> 00:03:47,386
[SPEAKER_03]: All after this.

80
00:03:47,487 --> 00:03:48,367
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the MP3.

81
00:03:48,908 --> 00:03:51,510
[SPEAKER_03]: You've all been coming over from extreme.

82
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:52,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you haven't.

83
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:55,194
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Legend of Max here on Orange Lounge Radio.

84
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:55,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

85
00:04:58,579 --> 00:04:59,627
Thanks for watching!

86
00:06:01,058 --> 00:06:01,838
Black Joe!

87
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:02,278
Black Joe!

88
00:06:02,298 --> 00:06:02,618
Black Joe!

89
00:06:02,638 --> 00:06:02,899
Black Joe!

90
00:06:31,344 --> 00:06:32,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god!

91
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,225
[SPEAKER_25]: You've got mail.

92
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:39,448
During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative and

93
00:06:58,758 --> 00:07:00,839
[SPEAKER_01]: You bastards!

94
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,124
[SPEAKER_23]: You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you.

95
00:07:07,284 --> 00:07:13,228
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough whopper.

96
00:07:13,328 --> 00:07:15,149
[SPEAKER_23]: Please, good people, I am in haste.

97
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:22,313
[SPEAKER_03]: You are in the dark black forest of Orange Lounge Radio.

98
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:22,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we are.

99
00:07:23,641 --> 00:07:26,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Big, fat house tonight, filled with people.

100
00:07:26,302 --> 00:07:26,883
[SPEAKER_03]: This is crazy.

101
00:07:26,923 --> 00:07:28,103
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm fuzzy and full of nuts.

102
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:34,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Some new promos this week, thanks to the lovely DDR Angel and Stressa.

103
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:35,747
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys made some new promos for us.

104
00:07:36,147 --> 00:07:37,547
[SPEAKER_03]: What was going through your mind when you were making those?

105
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:39,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did you decide to make promos?

106
00:07:39,268 --> 00:07:40,569
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up with those?

107
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:43,390
[SPEAKER_20]: It was just random, and hey, look, it sounds good.

108
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:44,771
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, sounds good.

109
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:46,251
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, Angel, how you doing?

110
00:07:46,512 --> 00:07:47,232
[SPEAKER_20]: No comment.

111
00:07:49,073 --> 00:07:51,254
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm losing you, Carmen, because...

112
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:53,115
[SPEAKER_20]: Wait, what was I supposed to say?

113
00:07:54,876 --> 00:08:01,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, first off, as I promised in the chat room, tonight we are bringing back the word of the day.

114
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,142
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember when we did rave and we had the sandstorm?

115
00:08:04,743 --> 00:08:07,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, tell us all about tonight's word of the day.

116
00:08:08,826 --> 00:08:11,087
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I think we decided on this one.

117
00:08:11,548 --> 00:08:13,109
[SPEAKER_16]: The word of the day is slut.

118
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:14,810
[SPEAKER_16]: The word of the day is slut.

119
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,772
[SPEAKER_16]: And whenever we say the word slut, you get this.

120
00:08:20,922 --> 00:08:26,327
[SPEAKER_11]: The biggest slut in the world, Paula Terry.

121
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:30,410
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't want to hear Paula Terry over and over and over again.

122
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,191
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

123
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:33,413
[SPEAKER_16]: So just don't say slut.

124
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:35,214
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, you said slut.

125
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:45,888
[SPEAKER_11]: J.B.

126
00:08:45,928 --> 00:08:46,528
[SPEAKER_16]: will kill you.

127
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:52,951
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so now you all know the word of the day.

128
00:08:53,092 --> 00:08:56,373
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're allowed to do that now because the band, the year's over, so the band's over.

129
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,474
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can play Apolitary as much as we want on this station.

130
00:08:58,515 --> 00:08:59,395
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's enact a new band.

131
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:00,536
[SPEAKER_03]: You want a new band?

132
00:09:01,136 --> 00:09:02,197
[SPEAKER_16]: Be Apolitary for another year.

133
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, okay.

134
00:09:03,437 --> 00:09:05,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Apolitary is banned from Orange Lounge for another year.

135
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:07,339
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe, we'll think about it.

136
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:07,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, we'll think about it.

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,520
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll consider it.

138
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:10,341
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

139
00:09:10,661 --> 00:09:14,102
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to say things into a mic, or else they don't hear it on the radio.

140
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:15,283
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

141
00:09:15,503 --> 00:09:16,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharp object.

142
00:09:17,043 --> 00:09:17,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Word.

143
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,644
[SPEAKER_16]: Or a pointy stick.

144
00:09:19,164 --> 00:09:21,165
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to go back to a time warp here.

145
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,085
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to go back to two weeks.

146
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:26,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, by the way, lovely job last week.

147
00:09:27,027 --> 00:09:28,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't hear the whole show.

148
00:09:28,587 --> 00:09:29,847
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard bits and pieces.

149
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:32,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't hear that because of all the propelling.

150
00:09:32,108 --> 00:09:32,368
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

151
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:32,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I get the same problem.

152
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:35,349
[SPEAKER_03]: When I drink Propel and play DDR, that's like instant pee.

153
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,510
[SPEAKER_16]: I went through three bottles of Propel that show.

154
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Were they all berrylicious?

155
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,100
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh-huh.

156
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:41,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, cool.

157
00:09:41,721 --> 00:09:43,281
[SPEAKER_16]: I have nuts stuck in my teeth, sorry.

158
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:44,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa!

159
00:09:44,981 --> 00:09:45,362
[SPEAKER_16]: Whoa!

160
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too!

161
00:09:46,062 --> 00:09:47,122
[SPEAKER_03]: How come we haven't heard from Loki?

162
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:47,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's Loki?

163
00:09:49,383 --> 00:09:50,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're right there, okay.

164
00:09:50,043 --> 00:09:54,664
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because I don't have a chair, and I'm sitting on the floor without a mic.

165
00:09:55,844 --> 00:09:57,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you liked getting to pet the rug here.

166
00:09:59,585 --> 00:10:01,106
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a wrong rug, I think.

167
00:10:02,086 --> 00:10:02,886
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't you like petting rug?

168
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:05,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

169
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:06,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

170
00:10:06,957 --> 00:10:07,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a road muncher?

171
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:10,662
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to time warp back to two weeks ago.

172
00:10:10,702 --> 00:10:11,483
[SPEAKER_03]: We did the last show.

173
00:10:11,803 --> 00:10:12,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Only on the weekends.

174
00:10:12,965 --> 00:10:14,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, then up came the weekend.

175
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki and I, we took a little road trip.

176
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:17,871
[SPEAKER_03]: We went down to SoCal.

177
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:19,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Bitches.

178
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:20,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Bitter table of one.

179
00:10:22,076 --> 00:10:22,437
[SPEAKER_29]: Bitches.

180
00:10:24,296 --> 00:10:29,118
[SPEAKER_03]: We went down to SoCal and we were there and we have a little summary of it, right?

181
00:10:29,158 --> 00:10:30,078
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to play this bit?

182
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:30,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

183
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:32,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's see if this works here.

184
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Our live piece, well not our live piece, but our somewhat live piece, a week delayed.

185
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:38,022
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to know about your piece.

186
00:10:39,742 --> 00:10:40,883
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to go back to eating my nuts.

187
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, enjoy this bit from SoCal.

188
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:44,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I can never reach.

189
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:46,225
[SPEAKER_03]: First here on Orange Launch Radio.

190
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,715
[SPEAKER_03]: So here it is, the taped garbage part of the show.

191
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:56,478
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you may or may not know, last week, Loki and I decided to take a little trip.

192
00:10:56,858 --> 00:10:58,599
[SPEAKER_03]: And we decided to visit Southern California.

193
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:00,640
[SPEAKER_03]: And with me here, of course, is Loki.

194
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello.

195
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, everybody.

196
00:11:02,741 --> 00:11:08,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, describe for us, Matt, since I'm not a very good speaker, what kind of place are we at right now?

197
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:10,629
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

198
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:34,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, overpriced games.

199
00:11:34,712 --> 00:11:36,873
[SPEAKER_03]: But they had a, what was that derby game?

200
00:11:37,953 --> 00:11:39,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Derby Owners Club.

201
00:11:39,394 --> 00:11:40,794
[SPEAKER_03]: The hot new Milpitas game.

202
00:11:41,555 --> 00:11:42,155
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun.

203
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I jacked someone's horse, so that was kind of cool.

204
00:11:45,656 --> 00:11:46,397
[SPEAKER_29]: Horse Breeders Club.

205
00:11:46,437 --> 00:11:47,597
[SPEAKER_29]: He stole my horse!

206
00:11:48,017 --> 00:11:50,038
[SPEAKER_29]: Come back here with my horse!

207
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:51,739
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that was kind of fun.

208
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,481
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we just saw Die Another Day, which was a giant penis.

209
00:11:57,532 --> 00:12:03,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but before they had even worse freaking previews of movies that were just going to really suck ass.

210
00:12:04,454 --> 00:12:07,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Movies started at 2, the actual film started at 2.30.

211
00:12:08,236 --> 00:12:08,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's put it that way.

212
00:12:09,716 --> 00:12:11,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Awful, awful, awful.

213
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:13,938
[SPEAKER_03]: So what other kinds of crap have we done this weekend?

214
00:12:14,138 --> 00:12:15,338
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been and we've seen all the sites.

215
00:12:15,438 --> 00:12:16,999
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to CyberZone yesterday.

216
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:19,719
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to Arcade Infinity last night.

217
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,180
[SPEAKER_03]: What other kind of junk have we done here?

218
00:12:22,145 --> 00:12:25,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to Japan Arcade, got to play Beat Me at 3, so that was kind of fun.

219
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:32,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Played lots of Pump It Up, played a game that's a Korean knockoff of Dance Station 3 DDX, which was pretty fun.

220
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:33,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to try that out.

221
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:35,813
[SPEAKER_03]: You played 8th style and 7th style.

222
00:12:37,469 --> 00:12:38,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Poppin' Music owns you.

223
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,612
[SPEAKER_04]: It's giant seizure lights for your pushing pleasure.

224
00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:10,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll stick with Crackin' DJ.

225
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:11,796
[SPEAKER_17]: Crack.

226
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:22,645
[SPEAKER_03]: So, anyway, one other thing that we've gotten to do this week is we got to visit an old friend of the show, an old buddy of the show that's been listening, I think, ever since the very first episode, if I'm not mistaken.

227
00:13:22,745 --> 00:13:23,786
[SPEAKER_03]: No, since the third episode.

228
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:24,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

229
00:13:25,207 --> 00:13:26,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody listened to the first episode, huh?

230
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:27,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot.

231
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:28,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

232
00:13:29,331 --> 00:13:30,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, say hello, everybody.

233
00:13:30,872 --> 00:13:32,273
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the one, the only, SoCalKicks.

234
00:13:32,694 --> 00:13:33,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everybody.

235
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:34,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Um.

236
00:13:36,118 --> 00:13:36,639
[SPEAKER_03]: What is up?

237
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:37,639
[SPEAKER_03]: What is up, my brother?

238
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,279
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your day?

239
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,861
[SPEAKER_03]: A blast, especially seeing everything I just got.

240
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:46,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, yes, the recipient of some lovely partying gifts from Orange Lounge Radio.

241
00:13:46,363 --> 00:13:49,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's from Loki, but, you know, it's part of Orange Lounge Radio, right?

242
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:50,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

243
00:13:50,745 --> 00:13:51,486
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, yes.

244
00:13:51,806 --> 00:13:57,088
[SPEAKER_03]: The prize pack, and what lovely things do we have in the prize pack?

245
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:02,531
[SPEAKER_03]: The only two things I know they give out, movies, anime DVDs, and porn.

246
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,806
[SPEAKER_03]: So, he didn't even have to make an edit to get that point.

247
00:14:06,826 --> 00:14:07,346
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing.

248
00:14:07,526 --> 00:14:08,066
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel?

249
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:09,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

250
00:14:10,227 --> 00:14:11,948
[SPEAKER_03]: What was this you were telling me?

251
00:14:12,408 --> 00:14:16,009
[SPEAKER_03]: You were mentioning that you're walking away here with like 20 DVDs or something.

252
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe not 20, but like 10 at least.

253
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,550
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's this about?

254
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,211
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even own a DVD player or anything?

255
00:14:22,251 --> 00:14:23,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you own a DVD player?

256
00:14:23,371 --> 00:14:24,052
[SPEAKER_03]: What's this going on?

257
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't own any DVD movies.

258
00:14:26,052 --> 00:14:30,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I rarely rent some, but now I have something to use my DVD players for.

259
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:33,955
[SPEAKER_03]: You can watch such fine films as Blue Crush.

260
00:14:35,032 --> 00:14:36,093
[SPEAKER_03]: and Undercover Brother.

261
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:38,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing films there.

262
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:39,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm sorry.

263
00:14:39,595 --> 00:14:42,257
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember, you only need one hand to use a DVD remote.

264
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Chirp, chirp, blink, blink.

265
00:14:46,099 --> 00:14:46,780
[SPEAKER_17]: If you got porn.

266
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,042
[SPEAKER_26]: Ha!

267
00:14:50,362 --> 00:14:51,103
[SPEAKER_26]: Joke's on you.

268
00:14:51,263 --> 00:14:52,744
[SPEAKER_26]: It was VHS porn.

269
00:14:55,325 --> 00:14:58,027
[SPEAKER_11]: You still only need one hand to use a VHS remote.

270
00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:00,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to the table.

271
00:15:02,116 --> 00:15:02,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't wait!

272
00:15:03,477 --> 00:15:06,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so, you know, here it is, your chance, you finally get to be on the show.

273
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,241
[SPEAKER_03]: What kinds of things do you have to say for the listeners?

274
00:15:10,062 --> 00:15:11,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, nothing much, actually.

275
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:16,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you sure talk a lot in the chat room, and now that you have your chance, you don't have anything to say now?

276
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Or should I say, and you don't have anything to say now?

277
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:20,810
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't.

278
00:15:21,911 --> 00:15:23,332
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't talk that way in real life, by the way.

279
00:15:23,352 --> 00:15:24,573
[SPEAKER_03]: You promised me you would, and you don't.

280
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:26,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't talk much in real life.

281
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:27,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.

282
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:31,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people you meet from the DDR community don't talk much.

283
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:33,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I hardly ever talk much.

284
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:35,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless there's a microphone in front of me, I don't talk much.

285
00:15:35,358 --> 00:15:36,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up, bitch.

286
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:37,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

287
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:37,900
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fun.

288
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,025
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to play Max 2 in the middle of a theater and watch people go, What are they doing?

289
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:45,026
[SPEAKER_04]: What are they stepping on the arrows for?

290
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:46,087
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you do that?

291
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:50,852
[SPEAKER_04]: That brings me back to the stupid people that I've seen up in NorCal.

292
00:15:52,896 --> 00:15:59,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Now unfortunately, the one, the only, the fabulous DarkSakura couldn't be here with us tonight because she has that little thing called work.

293
00:15:59,101 --> 00:16:01,082
[SPEAKER_03]: So, do you have any messages for Jamie?

294
00:16:01,202 --> 00:16:01,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything you want to say?

295
00:16:02,783 --> 00:16:04,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I still need my GameCube pen, please.

296
00:16:07,307 --> 00:16:09,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give Jamie a minute to chime in here.

297
00:16:10,189 --> 00:16:11,510
[SPEAKER_16]: Fucking GameCube pen.

298
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,871
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

299
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:15,673
[SPEAKER_16]: The GameCube pen.

300
00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:19,207
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what happened to it because I had it for so long.

301
00:16:19,548 --> 00:16:29,057
[SPEAKER_16]: However, if I can't find it, I can give you a PS1 keychain clip pen.

302
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:30,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

303
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:31,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's get back to the tape.

304
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

305
00:16:33,882 --> 00:16:39,788
[SPEAKER_04]: And in case she didn't say what I think she said, she's going to say, you haven't emailed me the proof yet.

306
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:42,406
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

307
00:16:42,446 --> 00:16:45,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, where is this proof that she speaketh of?

308
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:47,589
[SPEAKER_08]: I lost my Dexterite, sorry.

309
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, I think she lost her GameCube pen.

310
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,811
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you have to say about that?

311
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:57,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I was right.

312
00:16:58,114 --> 00:16:59,374
[SPEAKER_03]: So, let's see.

313
00:16:59,454 --> 00:17:02,476
[SPEAKER_03]: What else can we talk about here in the little SoCal segment?

314
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:04,897
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we going to do with the rest of the time here in SoCal?

315
00:17:05,706 --> 00:17:11,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one thing we're going to do tomorrow is check out AI, because it's rumored that they're going to get DDR Extreme there, so hopefully they will.

316
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:18,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Rumor, rumor, just like it was rumored that, uh, what was it, CyberZone was going to get it yesterday, and obviously it wasn't.

317
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:21,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Omaha, Nebraska.

318
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:24,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Freaking Omaha, dude.

319
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,051
[SPEAKER_03]: If I ever have a band, I'm naming it freaking Omaha.

320
00:17:30,431 --> 00:17:34,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of Max 2 and the Aussie Landers, this time we got Extreme and the Rednecks.

321
00:17:36,894 --> 00:17:37,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeehaw.

322
00:17:38,896 --> 00:17:41,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just, I'm not very happy with that.

323
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,862
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, we got our 2DX machine when we come back, so that's kind of cool.

324
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:50,826
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a fellow from Omaha that came out to shaft, so you know, he wasn't a redneck at all.

325
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:56,491
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a very cool guy, so I'm happy for the, I'm happy yet insane with jealousy for those folks in Omaha.

326
00:17:56,591 --> 00:17:57,092
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you say?

327
00:17:58,266 --> 00:17:58,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Not anymore.

328
00:17:58,826 --> 00:18:01,968
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to see definitely a bunch of cool stuff.

329
00:18:01,988 --> 00:18:05,269
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that one mall we went to was pretty sweet in Little Tokyo.

330
00:18:05,989 --> 00:18:09,691
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to spend money and I bought models and cool stuff.

331
00:18:11,454 --> 00:18:12,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

332
00:18:12,394 --> 00:18:15,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Any words of advice for things we should do while we're in SoCal or the places we should go?

333
00:18:15,836 --> 00:18:18,317
[SPEAKER_03]: As you are the resident expert right now, at least out of the three of us.

334
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:20,718
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't the biggest mall.

335
00:18:21,218 --> 00:18:24,639
[SPEAKER_03]: You still haven't been to some of the biggest malls we have around here.

336
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:26,600
[SPEAKER_03]: You should go to The Block.

337
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,841
[SPEAKER_03]: You should honestly go to The Block.

338
00:18:27,861 --> 00:18:28,661
[SPEAKER_03]: That place is huge.

339
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but what other mall has a giant glowing phallic symbol?

340
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:33,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

341
00:18:34,286 --> 00:18:40,710
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this giant glowing green thing, and oh my god, now it's red, and it glows, and it looks like... And look at the little tip!

342
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:45,254
[SPEAKER_03]: It's even got a little tip, and... I took some pictures, though, while we were down here.

343
00:18:45,614 --> 00:18:46,134
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, cock!

344
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:49,176
[SPEAKER_26]: I gotta mention, this really cool game I played yesterday.

345
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:56,501
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, this game involves a monkey running around on a grid, undressing a woman.

346
00:18:57,822 --> 00:18:58,963
[SPEAKER_26]: I know how weird that sounds.

347
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:00,004
[SPEAKER_26]: That was a fucking badass game.

348
00:19:00,024 --> 00:19:00,164
[SPEAKER_26]: But, uh...

349
00:19:01,249 --> 00:19:02,150
[SPEAKER_26]: It was so addictive.

350
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,570
[SPEAKER_04]: It was better than DDR.

351
00:19:04,271 --> 00:19:06,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, it was really cool.

352
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:06,852
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a lot of fun.

353
00:19:06,892 --> 00:19:11,775
[SPEAKER_04]: And afterwards, you get 15 seconds to zoom in and Google the woman.

354
00:19:12,356 --> 00:19:12,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

355
00:19:13,656 --> 00:19:13,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun.

356
00:19:15,277 --> 00:19:15,557
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

357
00:19:15,577 --> 00:19:18,399
[SPEAKER_03]: We better wrap up this segment and get back to the real show.

358
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:23,442
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have to ask SoCalKicks, because we always ask the hosts of the show whenever it's over.

359
00:19:23,822 --> 00:19:28,625
[SPEAKER_03]: We always go around the three of us, and we always say our final thoughts of the day and any guests that happen to be in the studio.

360
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:32,506
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just going to ask us, what are your final thoughts of the day?

361
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:34,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki gives the best hookups.

362
00:19:36,371 --> 00:19:39,033
[SPEAKER_03]: He also gives the best, never mind, we're going to go back to the show now.

363
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:39,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night.

364
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,702
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we... Hey, hey.

365
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:43,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

366
00:19:44,863 --> 00:19:45,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah.

367
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:49,527
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I said something like, uh, no, I do not.

368
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:51,088
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what you're talking about.

369
00:19:51,748 --> 00:19:53,870
[SPEAKER_03]: That is wrong and very disgusting.

370
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, whatever.

371
00:19:55,351 --> 00:19:55,811
[SPEAKER_03]: And you enjoy it.

372
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, big thank you to our buddy SoCalKicks for spending some time with us.

373
00:19:59,794 --> 00:20:00,815
[SPEAKER_17]: Send me proof you get a pen.

374
00:20:02,476 --> 00:20:04,197
[SPEAKER_17]: If you really want a pen now, I can send you a Bic.

375
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:05,878
[SPEAKER_03]: A Bic?

376
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:08,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you gonna flick your Bic?

377
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:10,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna flick my Bic.

378
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,523
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, Brad's pen glows.

379
00:20:14,265 --> 00:20:15,066
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Ravar pen.

380
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:17,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, I wanna take E and make out with everybody.

381
00:20:18,568 --> 00:20:21,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad, don't you be turning into a slut on me.

382
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:25,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I said slut.

383
00:20:26,114 --> 00:20:27,395
[SPEAKER_03]: You said it on purpose.

384
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:27,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody heard it.

385
00:20:28,717 --> 00:20:28,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

386
00:20:32,463 --> 00:20:42,890
[SPEAKER_03]: So, then also what happened when Loki and I were gone, that Friday is when, here in Orange Lounge World Headquarters in Sacramento, finally, 2DX 8-Style lands here in Sacramento.

387
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:49,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you guys talked about this on the show last week, so I won't go too far into it, but 8-Style's here, it rules, the end.

388
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:56,065
[SPEAKER_03]: This week, Xtreme started spreading like a bad case of VD all around California.

389
00:20:57,606 --> 00:21:02,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and it made its way to Stockton last night, so we took a trip down to Stockton Golf Land.

390
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,072
[SPEAKER_03]: As I call it for short, GAG, Ghetto Ass Golf Land.

391
00:21:07,373 --> 00:21:10,355
[SPEAKER_03]: And we went down to GAG to play DDR Xtreme.

392
00:21:10,455 --> 00:21:12,476
[SPEAKER_03]: So, five of us went.

393
00:21:13,557 --> 00:21:16,319
[SPEAKER_03]: The three of us hosts and Angel Straycell went.

394
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:17,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to go?

395
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:17,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

396
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,161
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want to say about, specifically, what do you want to say about DDR Extreme?

397
00:21:21,261 --> 00:21:24,002
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I know there's lots of people listening going, Extreme!

398
00:21:25,162 --> 00:21:26,783
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, I thought that Frozen Ray was neat.

399
00:21:26,843 --> 00:21:30,084
[SPEAKER_26]: Shame on Golfland for getting a bootleg!

400
00:21:30,244 --> 00:21:31,245
[SPEAKER_26]: Bad, bad!

401
00:21:32,085 --> 00:21:33,505
[SPEAKER_16]: They had the most ghetto marquee.

402
00:21:33,766 --> 00:21:41,268
[SPEAKER_16]: They took the DDR, um, the 7th mix sign that was up there, and they put a big sign over that said, Extreme DDR 8th!

403
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:43,349
[SPEAKER_04]: 8th mix, because they're stupid.

404
00:21:45,114 --> 00:21:45,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Stupid people.

405
00:21:46,234 --> 00:21:47,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish it said Aderd Mix.

406
00:21:47,495 --> 00:21:48,755
[SPEAKER_14]: I would have paid so much money for it.

407
00:21:50,656 --> 00:21:51,396
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll make one for him.

408
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:54,697
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are you guys saying?

409
00:21:54,717 --> 00:21:55,637
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you guys think of Max 2?

410
00:21:55,977 --> 00:21:56,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, I meant Max 2.

411
00:21:58,738 --> 00:21:59,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, fuck DDR.

412
00:21:59,998 --> 00:22:04,880
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think of Extreme in comparison to Max 2?

413
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,800
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Max 2 Plus.

414
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,061
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what I thought.

415
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:10,481
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just DDR Max 2 Plus.

416
00:22:11,221 --> 00:22:12,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, no?

417
00:22:14,386 --> 00:22:24,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, let's see, there's a few things, uh, a few things I was disappointed on is the Oni remixes that they had in Max 2 that were supposed to be playable now, they only had one set of steps, and that was the only steps.

418
00:22:25,494 --> 00:22:30,237
[SPEAKER_04]: So, ooh, thanks for going all the way and, uh, giving us, you know, new steps for those.

419
00:22:31,138 --> 00:22:36,762
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, some of the new songs I just didn't really care for, there was a really cool poppin' music one that was like a...

420
00:22:38,945 --> 00:22:39,525
[SPEAKER_26]: You know what?

421
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:44,068
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't see, except for you, Rob, no one else played that fucking song.

422
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:49,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to do something fucked up my last stage, so I'm like, I'll do the big hot air song.

423
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,371
[SPEAKER_03]: No one played that song.

424
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:57,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I was looking at the top three songs for 321 Stars, Vanity Angel, Surprise, and Tears.

425
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:05,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the only... Now, that was the thing I liked about Xtreme, is that the videos, they keep getting better.

426
00:23:05,827 --> 00:23:09,608
[SPEAKER_03]: The video for Stoic was pretty funny, because it's just like the 2DX one, except it's the Afro guy doing it.

427
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:14,149
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um... So the video... What were some other songs I actually played?

428
00:23:14,449 --> 00:23:20,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I did the I Do, I Do, I Do, and it had this whole little, like, retro thing going on, with all these little pictures of hot little Asian girls.

429
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:24,191
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh... Speed Over Beethoven, I had Beethoven running all around, and all this other stuff.

430
00:23:24,211 --> 00:23:29,852
[SPEAKER_04]: The best video, one of the best videos has to be for Legend of Max, with the guys running in the background and shit like that.

431
00:23:30,112 --> 00:23:30,552
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.

432
00:23:30,612 --> 00:23:31,573
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god, Slytherin Max!

433
00:23:32,053 --> 00:23:33,574
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I liked the one for Jet World.

434
00:23:34,075 --> 00:23:34,755
[SPEAKER_16]: That was cool.

435
00:23:35,015 --> 00:23:37,858
[SPEAKER_16]: I wish they had the singing ladies with the humongous heads.

436
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,261
[SPEAKER_03]: That was beautiful, Jamie.

437
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:44,363
[SPEAKER_20]: That was us.

438
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,805
[SPEAKER_20]: Talk about an encore.

439
00:23:47,585 --> 00:23:48,546
[SPEAKER_20]: Personally, in my opinion...

440
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,276
[SPEAKER_20]: Extreme was just, yeah.

441
00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:53,716
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that too.

442
00:23:54,436 --> 00:23:56,057
[SPEAKER_20]: It just, it's with more shit.

443
00:23:57,237 --> 00:23:59,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, it's hard for me to get excited about Extreme.

444
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,738
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing that exciting in it.

445
00:24:03,098 --> 00:24:05,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, somebody's making this room a disco over here with the lights.

446
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:08,000
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, how about 8th style?

447
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,540
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, woohoo!

448
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:11,067
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, 8-Style's much cooler.

449
00:24:11,808 --> 00:24:12,148
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

450
00:24:12,989 --> 00:24:20,317
[SPEAKER_16]: I wish, though, I remember way back when there was a joke picture that someone had made a giant 2D X-Pad to play with their feet.

451
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:23,460
[SPEAKER_16]: They should do one of those.

452
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:27,982
[SPEAKER_26]: To hell with all you and your stupid 2DX!

453
00:24:28,022 --> 00:24:29,223
[SPEAKER_26]: 2DX sucks ass!

454
00:24:29,564 --> 00:24:31,065
[SPEAKER_26]: All of you suck ass!

455
00:24:31,946 --> 00:24:35,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, shut up.

456
00:24:38,173 --> 00:24:40,596
[SPEAKER_07]: All I know about Xtreme is it's just a green Max 2.

457
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:47,625
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, it's a green max, too, with twice as many songs, with more modes, and more options, and more difficulty.

458
00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:49,225
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, it's just the same damn game.

459
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:52,306
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, it's actually the first mission with 230 songs in it.

460
00:24:52,346 --> 00:24:53,206
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, woohoo!

461
00:24:53,567 --> 00:24:54,127
[SPEAKER_26]: Same game!

462
00:24:54,267 --> 00:24:55,527
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll all get played out.

463
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,008
[SPEAKER_26]: Watch us call it Beatmania, because that's what it really is.

464
00:24:58,068 --> 00:24:59,268
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just Beatmania, right?

465
00:24:59,328 --> 00:25:00,429
[SPEAKER_26]: No, it's Beatmania.

466
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:01,649
[SPEAKER_26]: It's Beatmania.

467
00:25:02,249 --> 00:25:03,690
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know, it looks like Street Fighter.

468
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,631
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, it's got pixels, it's on a monitor, you push buttons, it's all the same.

469
00:25:07,751 --> 00:25:10,772
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, now granted, I haven't played Extreme yet, but...

470
00:25:11,372 --> 00:25:20,159
[SPEAKER_15]: How come everyone got all excited to go from third mix to fourth mix and all it was was just added songs and stuff?

471
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:21,320
[SPEAKER_15]: They changed a few things here and there.

472
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,104
[SPEAKER_15]: But when it goes from max to extreme, everyone's just like, we're jaded.

473
00:25:27,565 --> 00:25:28,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, maybe that's it.

474
00:25:28,425 --> 00:25:28,705
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

475
00:25:28,886 --> 00:25:31,568
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because we didn't like the CD banners.

476
00:25:32,768 --> 00:25:33,889
[SPEAKER_08]: No one liked the discard.

477
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:34,850
[SPEAKER_08]: No one really cared.

478
00:25:35,611 --> 00:25:36,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a solution.

479
00:25:36,671 --> 00:25:37,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Play Pump It Up.

480
00:25:37,932 --> 00:25:38,552
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I like?

481
00:25:38,592 --> 00:25:39,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Pick it up.

482
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:43,975
[SPEAKER_16]: What I did like is that they had the song list.

483
00:25:44,115 --> 00:25:46,636
[SPEAKER_16]: You could divide it by game that it came from.

484
00:25:47,317 --> 00:25:48,337
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, see, I know.

485
00:25:48,357 --> 00:25:53,039
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, like, see, I hear that Extreme has a few new options too and stuff, but I don't know.

486
00:25:53,099 --> 00:26:01,103
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, it seems like everyone got all excited from, you know, transition from third to fourth, but not from, you know, seventh to eighth or, you know, I don't know.

487
00:26:01,463 --> 00:26:01,884
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, yeah.

488
00:26:03,064 --> 00:26:09,268
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's okay just to have, like, new stuff to kind of break the monotony of Max 2, because I can only stand to hear the whistle song so many times, you know?

489
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:10,709
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone.

490
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:11,550
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's gone.

491
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,332
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, it might be an unlock, but it's good.

492
00:26:14,352 --> 00:26:14,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

493
00:26:15,612 --> 00:26:15,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

494
00:26:17,353 --> 00:26:19,375
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of nice just to have some new songs kind of mixed up a little.

495
00:26:19,395 --> 00:26:23,177
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, the videos are nice, so it's pretty to watch, but... I didn't see Ghosts come back.

496
00:26:24,258 --> 00:26:25,039
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Ghosts did not come back.

497
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:25,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see either.

498
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:26,680
[SPEAKER_16]: That pisses me the fuck off.

499
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,461
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I liked playing Ghosts.

500
00:26:30,062 --> 00:26:31,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Telephone Operator did come back.

501
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:31,703
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty cool.

502
00:26:33,963 --> 00:26:37,889
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw somebody there playing Freckles just so they could get extra stage.

503
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, Jesus.

504
00:26:40,053 --> 00:26:46,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you're playing it to get an extra stage, yet you're wasting a stage to get that extra stage.

505
00:26:46,463 --> 00:26:47,044
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up with that?

506
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,881
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, then, fuck that!

507
00:26:50,102 --> 00:26:52,623
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of weird, though, because it's now the extra stage.

508
00:26:52,643 --> 00:26:53,964
[SPEAKER_03]: You can pick any song you want.

509
00:26:53,984 --> 00:26:59,228
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just on reverse 1-5 with, um... Butterfly extra stage.

510
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:00,369
[SPEAKER_03]: That is pretty cool.

511
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:03,912
[SPEAKER_04]: And heavy, but, um... Let's see.

512
00:27:04,812 --> 00:27:08,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have to say that, uh... Paranoia Survivor, that was hard.

513
00:27:08,615 --> 00:27:09,156
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fun.

514
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,857
[SPEAKER_08]: I only got about halfway through on doubles.

515
00:27:11,157 --> 00:27:13,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I owned A on the Oni, um...

516
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you double A'd A on Heavy on singles the first time.

517
00:27:18,881 --> 00:27:25,783
[SPEAKER_08]: I passed A on the Oni steps, which are Kata on doubles, and that was fun.

518
00:27:26,723 --> 00:27:29,604
[SPEAKER_04]: And Trip Machine, Survivors, Easy as Hell.

519
00:27:30,504 --> 00:27:32,264
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a weird fucking song.

520
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:33,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Weird, weird song.

521
00:27:35,105 --> 00:27:36,885
[SPEAKER_16]: What was that one song, Guacamole?

522
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:38,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Gumland, A Couple.

523
00:27:38,946 --> 00:27:39,106
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

524
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,422
[SPEAKER_16]: That song pissed me off, but I was more pissed off because of the situation.

525
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:45,363
[SPEAKER_16]: Everything was against me.

526
00:27:46,203 --> 00:27:47,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like gag, ghetto-esque offline.

527
00:27:48,164 --> 00:27:48,545
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you say?

528
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:52,407
[SPEAKER_04]: It had really crazy-ass, what was it, cactus in the background.

529
00:27:52,427 --> 00:27:53,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was pretty cool.

530
00:27:53,248 --> 00:27:55,269
[SPEAKER_03]: The cactus playing Samba was pretty cool.

531
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, the videos are great.

532
00:27:57,951 --> 00:27:59,212
[SPEAKER_03]: The videos keep getting better and better.

533
00:27:59,532 --> 00:28:07,397
[SPEAKER_08]: The best fucking background in a DDR game ever has to be A. A has the most kick-ass background image for it.

534
00:28:07,717 --> 00:28:08,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.

535
00:28:09,737 --> 00:28:11,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Chatroom's asking what about V, V's video.

536
00:28:11,818 --> 00:28:19,139
[SPEAKER_16]: I did see somebody... I really dug the splash screen for V. Yeah, somebody played V. The splash screen was... It's Tron walking down the stairs.

537
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:20,300
[SPEAKER_16]: It's such a freeze frame of it.

538
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,740
[SPEAKER_16]: With her all shadowed out with the blue light from behind.

539
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember the video itself, though.

540
00:28:24,521 --> 00:28:26,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just one of those generic rave videos.

541
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:27,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Generic random shit.

542
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:28,421
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much it.

543
00:28:29,122 --> 00:28:30,422
[SPEAKER_03]: So there wasn't any special video for that.

544
00:28:30,482 --> 00:28:32,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I think A didn't have a special video either.

545
00:28:32,102 --> 00:28:35,463
[SPEAKER_03]: If I remember right, it just had the V. It just had some random stuff, yeah.

546
00:28:36,363 --> 00:28:38,205
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, so that's all of our thoughts on Xtreme.

547
00:28:38,225 --> 00:28:38,665
[SPEAKER_28]: Anything else?

548
00:28:39,205 --> 00:28:40,246
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel, you're so quiet over there.

549
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:41,487
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you have anything you want to say about Xtreme?

550
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:43,729
[SPEAKER_28]: No.

551
00:28:43,749 --> 00:28:44,710
[SPEAKER_28]: She says no.

552
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:47,953
[SPEAKER_18]: We're eating death cookies.

553
00:28:49,114 --> 00:28:50,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, okay.

554
00:28:50,255 --> 00:28:51,996
[SPEAKER_08]: They had, they had, um, what was it?

555
00:28:52,477 --> 00:28:54,058
[SPEAKER_08]: They had this really... Murder never tasted better.

556
00:28:55,345 --> 00:29:07,727
[SPEAKER_04]: They had this really cool Japanese heavy metal song that was in there, and it had a really twisted, it had this character from Poppy Music in the background, dressed up like a samurai, and he looked really evil looking, so that was kind of cool, they had that in there.

557
00:29:08,168 --> 00:29:14,249
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, it was, not, it was a really awesome, it was a really awesome heavy metal song, though.

558
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:20,070
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy that was playing it was really cool at freestyling, too, so that was kind of cool to watch.

559
00:29:21,949 --> 00:29:24,550
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, so I think at this point in the show we're going to take a quick break.

560
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:25,111
[SPEAKER_28]: Sound good to you?

561
00:29:25,651 --> 00:29:26,951
[SPEAKER_28]: Anything else you want to say on Extreme, Jamie?

562
00:29:26,991 --> 00:29:27,492
[SPEAKER_28]: Marzipita!

563
00:29:28,112 --> 00:29:32,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we gotta go get... Um, it was extremely, um, yeah.

564
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:34,799
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I wouldn't say it's a waste.

565
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:36,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't by any means say it's a waste.

566
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,581
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a badly needed upgrade to Max 2.

567
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:42,662
[SPEAKER_03]: But it doesn't bring anything new into DDR.

568
00:29:42,762 --> 00:29:44,502
[SPEAKER_20]: That's so completely average.

569
00:29:45,863 --> 00:29:48,844
[SPEAKER_20]: They didn't put any of the cooler songs from 2DX in.

570
00:29:48,924 --> 00:29:49,944
[SPEAKER_20]: That kind of pisses me off.

571
00:29:50,684 --> 00:29:51,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

572
00:29:52,005 --> 00:29:52,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them.

573
00:29:52,685 --> 00:29:56,666
[SPEAKER_03]: A is kind of fun to dance to, but I mean, it's just, the steps were a little easy.

574
00:29:56,686 --> 00:29:57,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I hear the Oni ones are harder.

575
00:29:57,927 --> 00:29:59,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I only played two games, so.

576
00:29:59,907 --> 00:30:01,928
[SPEAKER_16]: But now I have a decent selection of tax songs.

577
00:30:02,554 --> 00:30:03,615
[SPEAKER_03]: They should have put in Cracker.

578
00:30:04,376 --> 00:30:04,776
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes!

579
00:30:05,076 --> 00:30:05,396
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes!

580
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:06,377
[SPEAKER_26]: No, no, no, no, no.

581
00:30:06,417 --> 00:30:14,044
[SPEAKER_26]: Tears, Sucked Ass, Hyper Eurobeat, I wasn't touching that with a 10-foot pole, and Vandy Angel with double steps, Suck Ass.

582
00:30:15,385 --> 00:30:17,106
[SPEAKER_26]: That's pretty much it, yeah.

583
00:30:17,146 --> 00:30:19,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Speed over Beethoven wasn't as fun as people said it was.

584
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,029
[SPEAKER_16]: Lots of tack.

585
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:21,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, tack's cool.

586
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:22,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Stoke was pretty cool.

587
00:30:23,191 --> 00:30:28,496
[SPEAKER_20]: Some, uh, one of the songs was Naomi and, I forget who else featured in that one.

588
00:30:29,216 --> 00:30:29,957
[SPEAKER_20]: Politeary, I think.

589
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,811
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, I hate that slut.

590
00:30:35,011 --> 00:30:37,732
[SPEAKER_20]: When was this show ever funny?

591
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,613
[SPEAKER_11]: God, I hope they never bring that song back.

592
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:42,935
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my least favorite TDR song.

593
00:30:55,441 --> 00:30:56,602
[SPEAKER_16]: It has no musical quality.

594
00:30:56,682 --> 00:30:58,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we're going to take a quick break.

595
00:30:59,263 --> 00:31:02,465
[SPEAKER_03]: The show was funny when we mentioned Miss Muffet getting AIDS.

596
00:31:06,707 --> 00:31:07,487
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to come back.

597
00:31:07,647 --> 00:31:09,268
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought that your hooker story was pretty funny.

598
00:31:10,929 --> 00:31:13,310
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to come back and do the FUs of the week.

599
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,991
[SPEAKER_03]: So send those to me over in the chat room.

600
00:31:16,031 --> 00:31:17,972
[SPEAKER_03]: And dear God, we've got a lot of people to get through tonight.

601
00:31:18,052 --> 00:31:19,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So make them short.

602
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:24,976
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we'll be back after a quick break featuring those two little letters you all love.

603
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,970
Thank you for watching!

604
00:32:03,582 --> 00:32:04,683
Thanks for watching!

605
00:33:21,956 --> 00:33:22,438
And now...

606
00:34:45,108 --> 00:34:45,851
Thanks for watching!

607
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,541
Thanks for watching!

608
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

609
00:37:31,011 --> 00:37:31,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

610
00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:32,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this thing on?

611
00:37:32,072 --> 00:37:32,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Testing.

612
00:37:33,773 --> 00:37:34,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Testing 1-2.

613
00:37:35,195 --> 00:37:39,158
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

614
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:39,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

615
00:37:40,399 --> 00:37:41,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand this.

616
00:37:42,401 --> 00:37:43,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Does this thing work?

617
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:44,863
[SPEAKER_16]: This thing reads like stereo instructions.

618
00:37:44,923 --> 00:37:45,504
[SPEAKER_16]: Is this on?

619
00:37:45,524 --> 00:37:46,144
[SPEAKER_16]: What the hell?

620
00:37:48,686 --> 00:37:50,108
[SPEAKER_24]: Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37:50,288 --> 00:37:52,430
[SPEAKER_24]: Broke down Ghetto Bomani Radio.

00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:52,670
[SPEAKER_24]: What the?

00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,017
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38:22,993 --> 00:38:26,034
[SPEAKER_02]: That's getting added to the list, man!

637
00:38:26,955 --> 00:38:29,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't you see everybody eating pizza in front of you?

638
00:38:31,457 --> 00:38:32,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Blind much?

639
00:38:32,537 --> 00:38:34,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie's sitting here going, I love pizza.

640
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Trista's got pizza sitting in his freaking hand.

641
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the pizza here yet?

642
00:38:41,521 --> 00:38:42,321
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh my god.

643
00:38:42,381 --> 00:38:45,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they were supposed to deliver the pizza five minutes ago.

644
00:38:45,743 --> 00:38:46,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor Loki.

645
00:38:46,823 --> 00:38:47,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody tease Loki.

646
00:38:48,324 --> 00:38:49,464
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we paying this guy for?

647
00:38:49,484 --> 00:38:50,665
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not.

648
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:52,911
[SPEAKER_03]: He gives good handjobs.

649
00:38:52,971 --> 00:38:53,511
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just kidding.

650
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:53,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.

651
00:38:53,772 --> 00:38:54,192
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.

652
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:54,833
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I'm kidding.

653
00:38:56,094 --> 00:38:58,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, somebody said the S word.

654
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:08,546
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, all right, all right.

655
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:10,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about the FUs of the week, please.

656
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:11,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty please, Jamie.

657
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:12,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us all about it.

658
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck, fuck, fuck, good luck, screw it, kangaroo.

659
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:15,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

660
00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:19,239
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be one of those shows.

661
00:39:19,299 --> 00:39:20,380
[SPEAKER_03]: It is one of those shows.

662
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

663
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:30,482
[SPEAKER_16]: The hot kids of the week are when we get pissy and say, fuck you.

664
00:39:32,362 --> 00:39:32,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

665
00:39:32,502 --> 00:39:35,243
[SPEAKER_16]: See, Rob likes to censor it and go, F, not me.

666
00:39:36,003 --> 00:39:37,823
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't care about watching my fucking language.

667
00:39:38,803 --> 00:39:39,523
[SPEAKER_16]: So, fuck.

668
00:39:41,224 --> 00:39:47,145
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, if the two minutes off my life thing were true for everything, I would be burning in hell right now.

669
00:39:48,737 --> 00:39:50,578
[SPEAKER_16]: But remember, I have to take over hell.

670
00:39:51,379 --> 00:39:51,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, yes.

671
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so we're ready to do these FUs of the week.

672
00:39:53,761 --> 00:39:54,802
[SPEAKER_16]: My cootie-tory of hell.

673
00:39:55,302 --> 00:39:56,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you say your cootie-tory of hell?

674
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,585
[SPEAKER_16]: People who watch Udoni Kenshin would get it.

675
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:00,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

676
00:40:00,686 --> 00:40:01,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here we go.

677
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:05,590
[SPEAKER_03]: The FUs of the week, starting off with the FU goddess that we always start off with.

678
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:06,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck!

679
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,231
[SPEAKER_14]: Say it, Rob.

680
00:40:07,551 --> 00:40:07,911
[SPEAKER_14]: Say it.

681
00:40:08,211 --> 00:40:11,574
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the fuck, shit, cock, whore, piss, cunt FUs of the week.

682
00:40:12,635 --> 00:40:13,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Start saving.

683
00:40:14,296 --> 00:40:14,756
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

684
00:40:14,816 --> 00:40:18,119
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, my first fuck you of the week goes to my shoes.

685
00:40:20,163 --> 00:40:21,965
[SPEAKER_16]: People who have seen me know about my burning feet.

686
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:24,707
[SPEAKER_16]: I have the coolest pair of shoes in the universe.

687
00:40:24,727 --> 00:40:25,848
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want to see a doctor about that.

688
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:27,129
[SPEAKER_16]: Bite my ass.

689
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:28,550
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

690
00:40:29,751 --> 00:40:35,476
[SPEAKER_16]: I bought these shoes two and a half months ago from the Vans outlet, and the last pair of shoes I got from the Vans outlet lasted me a year and a half.

691
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,181
[SPEAKER_16]: These are starting to really kill my feet.

692
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:43,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Before I got my pair of shoes before these, I was having really bad problems with the arches in the old shoes.

693
00:40:44,063 --> 00:40:48,425
[SPEAKER_16]: I couldn't play DDR without having my arches hurt and having my feet just be really painful.

694
00:40:48,985 --> 00:40:53,527
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, these shoes are starting to do it to me, and I've only had two and a half months that I've been wearing them.

695
00:40:54,748 --> 00:40:56,208
[SPEAKER_16]: So, fuck my burning feet.

696
00:40:58,049 --> 00:40:58,749
[SPEAKER_16]: Bill might like it.

697
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:00,590
[SPEAKER_16]: Shut up, Rob.

698
00:41:02,531 --> 00:41:03,031
[SPEAKER_16]: Next thing.

699
00:41:04,008 --> 00:41:05,209
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck Stockton, Golfland.

700
00:41:05,249 --> 00:41:06,269
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck them right in their ear.

701
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:10,551
[SPEAKER_16]: Because they have those fans mounted on top of the machine.

702
00:41:11,312 --> 00:41:13,113
[SPEAKER_16]: And fans are nice and good and everything.

703
00:41:13,453 --> 00:41:16,634
[SPEAKER_16]: If it's not blowing in your eyes while you're trying to play a song for the first time.

704
00:41:17,195 --> 00:41:21,137
[SPEAKER_16]: I swear, when we were trying to play Guacamole Day Couple... Oh, what was it?

705
00:41:21,657 --> 00:41:22,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Gamelan Day Couple.

706
00:41:22,597 --> 00:41:22,818
[SPEAKER_16]: Gamelan.

707
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:23,698
[SPEAKER_16]: Why did I say Guacamole?

708
00:41:23,718 --> 00:41:24,478
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mambo song.

709
00:41:24,498 --> 00:41:26,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Just say the goddamn Mambo song.

710
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,600
[SPEAKER_16]: Guacamole.

711
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:31,282
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, um... I, uh...

712
00:41:32,644 --> 00:41:37,446
[SPEAKER_16]: The wind, it was blowing, like, dust in my eyes, and it was, like, tearing up the whole time, so I couldn't even see the play.

713
00:41:37,466 --> 00:41:38,766
[SPEAKER_16]: On top of that, my feet were hurting.

714
00:41:38,866 --> 00:41:39,386
[SPEAKER_16]: Goddamn shoes.

715
00:41:40,026 --> 00:41:44,448
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, like, the insoles in my shoes are peeling up, so it, like, rubs into the ball on my feet.

716
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:45,228
[SPEAKER_16]: Goddamn ball.

717
00:41:45,688 --> 00:41:46,028
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway.

718
00:41:46,768 --> 00:41:51,550
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, and then, fuck, um, fuck not getting enough sleep, because I have to do laundry.

719
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:52,450
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck all of my clothes.

720
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:54,251
[SPEAKER_16]: Because... All of them?

721
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,251
[SPEAKER_16]: I cleaned, I cleaned my room.

722
00:41:57,552 --> 00:41:59,052
[SPEAKER_03]: You got about 20 hours?

723
00:41:59,873 --> 00:42:00,673
[SPEAKER_16]: I cleaned my room.

724
00:42:01,932 --> 00:42:03,653
[SPEAKER_16]: I have done two loads of wash.

725
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:06,354
[SPEAKER_16]: I have about maybe ten more to go.

726
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:08,794
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't realize my wardrobe was so huge.

727
00:42:10,975 --> 00:42:13,396
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, the other thing, fuck my new pair of jeans.

728
00:42:14,136 --> 00:42:18,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Because, um, they were falsely made and now I can't return them because I've already won them.

729
00:42:18,878 --> 00:42:19,298
[SPEAKER_16]: In the rain.

730
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:21,199
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, fuck the rain.

731
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:22,719
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it's not.

732
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,581
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, fuck your Yankee blue jeans.

733
00:42:28,221 --> 00:42:28,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Bravo.

734
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:29,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

735
00:42:29,602 --> 00:42:29,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it?

736
00:42:29,942 --> 00:42:30,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

737
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:35,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you said that your list of priorities put food above strippers.

738
00:42:59,685 --> 00:43:00,006
[SPEAKER_26]: It did.

739
00:43:00,727 --> 00:43:01,928
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, my food's almost gone, see?

740
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:04,332
[SPEAKER_26]: So, anyway.

741
00:43:05,434 --> 00:43:09,760
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, there's a really huge FU, and that goes to Drivers, again.

742
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:11,322
[SPEAKER_26]: Akine...

743
00:43:12,731 --> 00:43:13,691
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm gonna kill you.

744
00:43:13,972 --> 00:43:15,572
[SPEAKER_26]: YOU FREAKING DIDN'T HEAR ME!

745
00:43:16,313 --> 00:43:16,853
[SPEAKER_26]: Seriously!

746
00:43:17,513 --> 00:43:18,614
[SPEAKER_26]: Stop trying to cut me off.

747
00:43:18,914 --> 00:43:23,096
[SPEAKER_26]: If you're stupid as an old Asian bitch, stop changing lanes for no apparent reason.

748
00:43:23,816 --> 00:43:25,717
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't give a shit if you don't know where you're going!

749
00:43:26,157 --> 00:43:27,058
[SPEAKER_26]: Don't get in my way!

750
00:43:27,898 --> 00:43:29,999
[SPEAKER_26]: F'ing stupid driver's ed, people!

751
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,001
[SPEAKER_26]: You're driving 40 miles under the speed limit, and you piss me off!

752
00:43:34,141 --> 00:43:37,943
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't care if you don't know how to drive, because you're never gonna learn how to drive C.A.

753
00:43:38,803 --> 00:43:39,144
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay?

754
00:43:40,704 --> 00:43:41,105
[SPEAKER_26]: Also,

755
00:43:42,325 --> 00:43:43,726
[SPEAKER_26]: FU to freaking Golflands.

756
00:43:44,086 --> 00:43:44,786
[SPEAKER_26]: They suck ass.

757
00:43:44,946 --> 00:43:47,527
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, Stockton Golflands, alright, but the carpet sucks shit.

758
00:43:48,228 --> 00:43:53,050
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, Roseville Golflands, hello, you kinda have to have drumsticks to play Drum Mania.

759
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,331
[SPEAKER_26]: That's kinda the point of the game.

760
00:43:55,851 --> 00:43:59,353
[SPEAKER_26]: You just, you know, bang the sticks against the drums.

761
00:43:59,513 --> 00:44:00,293
[SPEAKER_26]: That's how it works.

762
00:44:01,574 --> 00:44:03,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, also... It's Mambo Go Go now, didn't you hear?

763
00:44:03,935 --> 00:44:05,375
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, they upgraded.

764
00:44:05,496 --> 00:44:05,856
[SPEAKER_26]: Woo!

765
00:44:07,296 --> 00:44:10,778
[SPEAKER_26]: And, FU to DDR Extreme, for one reason...

766
00:44:12,222 --> 00:44:13,362
[SPEAKER_26]: La Copa de Vida.

767
00:44:15,183 --> 00:44:15,603
[SPEAKER_26]: Know what?

768
00:44:15,623 --> 00:44:18,524
[SPEAKER_26]: You put a Ricky Martin cover in any fucking DDR mix.

769
00:44:19,505 --> 00:44:19,925
[SPEAKER_26]: That's it.

770
00:44:20,425 --> 00:44:20,845
[SPEAKER_26]: For now.

771
00:44:21,665 --> 00:44:22,806
[SPEAKER_16]: I worked for Samba de Amigo.

772
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:26,827
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't fucking care.

773
00:44:29,008 --> 00:44:32,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt has a mouth full of... Anyway, going back to Jamie.

774
00:44:33,049 --> 00:44:34,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie's had a relapse.

775
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:34,650
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

776
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:36,711
[SPEAKER_16]: Back to the Golfland thing.

777
00:44:37,211 --> 00:44:38,651
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck those idiots last night.

778
00:44:38,731 --> 00:44:40,752
[SPEAKER_16]: I had your asses kicked out and that was cool.

779
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:42,886
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

780
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:44,268
[SPEAKER_03]: My turn.

781
00:44:44,928 --> 00:44:45,389
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you sure?

782
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:45,749
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

783
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:47,111
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week.

784
00:44:47,331 --> 00:44:49,573
[SPEAKER_03]: I would additionally like to give an FU of the week to drivers.

785
00:44:50,034 --> 00:44:50,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, fuck you.

786
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:58,922
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were driving on I-5 North about last Sunday night, about, oh, I don't know, any time between noon and nine, because that's how long we were on the goddamn road.

787
00:44:58,942 --> 00:45:01,185
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were driving on that road, fuck you.

788
00:45:01,325 --> 00:45:01,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate you.

789
00:45:02,026 --> 00:45:05,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Burn in hell for all eternity because you don't know how to fucking drive.

790
00:45:06,064 --> 00:45:06,964
[SPEAKER_03]: My pen is pretty good.

791
00:45:24,147 --> 00:45:24,507
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

792
00:45:24,567 --> 00:45:26,048
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all the FUs I can think of right now.

793
00:45:26,288 --> 00:45:29,069
[SPEAKER_03]: So, fuck Stockton Golf Line for being ghetto.

794
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:31,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fuck people that don't know how to follow a token line.

795
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:32,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck the token line.

796
00:45:32,931 --> 00:45:34,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Just fuck the token line altogether.

797
00:45:34,552 --> 00:45:41,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't fucking stay on the token line because nobody ever knows how to follow the token line because nobody is smart that plays DDR, apparently.

798
00:45:41,915 --> 00:45:45,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, crazy bitch, you don't fucking put 12 tokens on the goddamn line.

799
00:45:46,457 --> 00:45:48,018
[SPEAKER_02]: One at a time, you dumbass.

800
00:45:48,818 --> 00:45:49,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna be playing a lot!

801
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:54,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I give a fuck that bitch who puts 12 tokens on the machine and you say, you're only supposed to put one up.

802
00:45:54,862 --> 00:45:56,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm gonna be playing a lot.

803
00:45:56,763 --> 00:45:57,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you!

804
00:45:58,664 --> 00:46:02,906
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna be playing none at all when I have my foot so far up your fucking ass you won't be able to walk straight for a week.

805
00:46:06,548 --> 00:46:08,930
[SPEAKER_16]: No, you shoved the foot so far up her ass that she tastes rubber.

806
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:17,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, um, yeah, so fuck the token line, because nobody knows how to follow it.

807
00:46:18,023 --> 00:46:19,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Try a sign-up sheet.

808
00:46:19,244 --> 00:46:20,806
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes a pen and a piece of paper.

809
00:46:21,367 --> 00:46:21,768
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um...

810
00:46:24,257 --> 00:46:26,278
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you steal a pen, you're fucking sad.

811
00:46:26,298 --> 00:46:30,881
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have to steal a goddamn 50 cent big pen, your life is really fucking sad.

812
00:46:31,161 --> 00:46:31,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope you die.

813
00:46:31,982 --> 00:46:33,182
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you die of syphilis.

814
00:46:33,302 --> 00:46:36,905
[SPEAKER_03]: And F you to that stupid flamboyant retard who's playing Pair of Pair.

815
00:46:37,105 --> 00:46:42,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that Pair of Pair is a game for women, but fucking... Seriously, you're way too... Oh, yes!

816
00:46:42,268 --> 00:46:44,710
[SPEAKER_03]: And F you to people who play Bamadi games that look gayer than me.

817
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:46,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody is gayer than me!

818
00:46:46,731 --> 00:46:47,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody!

819
00:46:49,233 --> 00:46:50,994
[SPEAKER_26]: That was just... It was just so weird...

820
00:46:54,309 --> 00:47:02,276
[SPEAKER_03]: It, it, it's just, but this guy was more flamboyant than, oh my god, Liberace, this guy was more flamboyant than fucking Elton John.

821
00:47:05,418 --> 00:47:11,924
[SPEAKER_26]: He must have been the most flamboyant person on the known, he scares me, scares me.

822
00:47:12,624 --> 00:47:14,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I have video of it though, it will be going up on my website.

823
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:16,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're gonna be making flamingpara.com.

824
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:20,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

825
00:47:21,053 --> 00:47:22,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I got really ranty this week.

826
00:47:22,276 --> 00:47:23,117
[SPEAKER_03]: That was amazing.

827
00:47:23,137 --> 00:47:24,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, I see why Jamie likes this.

828
00:47:25,883 --> 00:47:26,545
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I fear.

829
00:47:27,146 --> 00:47:27,827
[SPEAKER_16]: With the PH3 PR.

830
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:32,392
[SPEAKER_26]: and FU to Dave and Buster for overcharging on their games.

831
00:47:33,313 --> 00:47:33,773
[SPEAKER_26]: That sucked.

832
00:47:34,114 --> 00:47:40,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, F Miss Thang, my horse in Derby Owners Club, my horse named Miss Thang, for coming in last place in every single race.

833
00:47:40,219 --> 00:47:41,160
[SPEAKER_03]: You suck, I hate you.

834
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:41,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn in the glue.

835
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,305
[SPEAKER_08]: And FU to the owner of Cloud, the fucking horse that beat both of ours because you're a stupid little girl and you think you know better.

836
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:49,487
[SPEAKER_26]: So, ha, I jacked your fucking horse.

837
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:50,508
[SPEAKER_26]: How do you say about that?

838
00:47:50,528 --> 00:47:50,708
[SPEAKER_26]: Huh?

839
00:47:50,728 --> 00:47:52,869
[SPEAKER_26]: You don't have your horse anymore because I have it.

840
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:53,450
[SPEAKER_26]: Woo!

841
00:47:55,031 --> 00:47:55,332
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

842
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:56,553
[SPEAKER_16]: My music again, please.

843
00:47:56,753 --> 00:47:57,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

844
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:06,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck my Trueno in Initial D. I love the car to death, but it has no acceleration, so I made a new car.

845
00:48:06,669 --> 00:48:08,932
[SPEAKER_16]: I have an Integra Type R now, and it's the same as Magic.

846
00:48:09,652 --> 00:48:09,973
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all.

847
00:48:10,632 --> 00:48:11,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I have another rant.

848
00:48:12,293 --> 00:48:14,574
[SPEAKER_03]: With the exception of Jamie, fuck Initial D players.

849
00:48:15,014 --> 00:48:16,834
[SPEAKER_03]: You all drive the same goddamn car.

850
00:48:16,974 --> 00:48:22,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw seven of you coming out of the Golf Land parking lot, all with cheap-ass plastic spoilers on your little rice rockets.

851
00:48:22,837 --> 00:48:23,217
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, no, no.

852
00:48:23,677 --> 00:48:24,657
[SPEAKER_16]: The erector set spoiler, too.

853
00:48:24,677 --> 00:48:26,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the erector set spoiler.

854
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:27,558
[SPEAKER_03]: God, you people are sad.

855
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Initial D is not real life.

856
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, folks, you're driving a Civic, not a race car.

857
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:34,601
[SPEAKER_00]: God.

858
00:48:35,101 --> 00:48:36,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Stickers do not make it go faster.

859
00:48:39,005 --> 00:48:43,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I put the Type R sticker on my Toyota.

860
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:46,772
[SPEAKER_16]: Excuse me, there's no Toyota car.

861
00:48:46,812 --> 00:48:48,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Your car is sad and so are you.

862
00:48:48,914 --> 00:48:50,135
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't drift on Highway 80.

863
00:48:50,535 --> 00:48:51,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Get over it.

864
00:48:53,559 --> 00:49:01,544
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, that doesn't stop me from getting my actual Corolla, 86 Corolla hatchback to modify into the Torino Sprinter with Amanda Payne.

865
00:49:03,486 --> 00:49:04,006
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just kidding.

866
00:49:04,146 --> 00:49:04,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie's cool like that.

867
00:49:04,886 --> 00:49:05,147
[SPEAKER_03]: She's okay.

868
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:05,947
[SPEAKER_03]: She's the exception to the rule.

869
00:49:05,967 --> 00:49:09,850
[SPEAKER_16]: The whole reason I would have a Ricey car is because I think they're funny.

870
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:13,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie can appreciate the comic value of a funny car.

871
00:49:13,032 --> 00:49:13,852
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they're funny.

872
00:49:13,912 --> 00:49:19,236
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to get, like, an 85 Mustang GT and, like, Ricey.

873
00:49:22,498 --> 00:49:26,981
[SPEAKER_08]: and F you to the stupid bitch at Rayleigh's, the Chinese food takeout place.

874
00:49:27,361 --> 00:49:28,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen, bitch, I don't want a sample.

875
00:49:29,082 --> 00:49:30,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't want a sample before.

876
00:49:30,763 --> 00:49:32,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop trying to give me a fucking sample after I get my food.

877
00:49:33,245 --> 00:49:36,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, I want what I'm getting and not what you're offering.

878
00:49:36,547 --> 00:49:40,230
[SPEAKER_26]: Stop trying to offer me the fucking sample, stupid Chinese bitch.

879
00:49:42,171 --> 00:49:42,451
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm done.

880
00:49:43,959 --> 00:49:46,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, Loki's PMSing.

881
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:47,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

882
00:49:48,241 --> 00:49:48,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, back to the FUs.

883
00:49:49,001 --> 00:49:49,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around the room.

884
00:49:50,082 --> 00:49:51,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we done with your FUs, Jamie?

885
00:49:51,343 --> 00:49:51,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess so.

886
00:49:51,803 --> 00:49:52,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, okay.

887
00:49:52,763 --> 00:49:53,323
[SPEAKER_16]: Give me money.

888
00:49:53,964 --> 00:49:54,104
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

889
00:49:54,404 --> 00:49:55,725
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck everyone who doesn't give me a dollar.

890
00:49:56,585 --> 00:49:56,845
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

891
00:49:57,225 --> 00:49:57,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

892
00:49:57,746 --> 00:49:58,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Going around the room.

893
00:50:00,595 --> 00:50:02,417
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the song I chose for all of your FUs.

894
00:50:03,137 --> 00:50:03,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy it.

895
00:50:04,538 --> 00:50:05,359
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start with Stressa.

896
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,020
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

897
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry, he sent me a track.

898
00:50:08,101 --> 00:50:08,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus Christ.

899
00:50:09,343 --> 00:50:09,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta find it.

900
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Then go to Angel.

901
00:50:11,284 --> 00:50:13,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Her and Magus wanted this song, right?

902
00:50:13,866 --> 00:50:14,447
[SPEAKER_03]: We want this song.

903
00:50:16,929 --> 00:50:17,670
[SPEAKER_03]: You want Butterfly?

904
00:50:18,691 --> 00:50:20,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, bitches, you're gonna take what I give you.

905
00:50:20,652 --> 00:50:21,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Now do your FUs.

906
00:50:22,594 --> 00:50:24,456
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, FU to our theme music.

907
00:50:24,496 --> 00:50:25,416
[SPEAKER_07]: We want Stoic.

908
00:50:26,798 --> 00:50:26,878
Ugh.

909
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:29,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, Jamie said so.

910
00:50:34,822 --> 00:50:35,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Magus, FUs.

911
00:50:39,023 --> 00:50:42,045
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, FU to Butterfly Upswing Mix.

912
00:50:42,525 --> 00:50:46,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I pick it by accident, then I accidentally put it on Maniac.

913
00:50:46,447 --> 00:50:46,987
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell?

914
00:50:47,087 --> 00:50:48,508
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't in the mood for a Kata.

915
00:50:51,409 --> 00:50:52,910
[SPEAKER_07]: I got four Katas on my belt.

916
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,951
[SPEAKER_07]: I go for... I accidentally put on a Kata.

917
00:50:57,373 --> 00:50:59,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Auto-fail within, I don't know, 30 seconds?

918
00:51:01,777 --> 00:51:05,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Waste my entire load.

919
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:06,320
[SPEAKER_07]: 50 seconds, okay?

920
00:51:07,201 --> 00:51:09,042
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an 8.

921
00:51:11,864 --> 00:51:12,485
[SPEAKER_07]: But still!

922
00:51:13,325 --> 00:51:13,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck!

923
00:51:13,806 --> 00:51:15,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Butterfly upswing mix, okay?

924
00:51:15,727 --> 00:51:17,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Alrighty.

925
00:51:24,246 --> 00:51:33,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel, you got any FUs of the week?

926
00:51:35,169 --> 00:51:36,269
[SPEAKER_18]: I had one, but he took it.

927
00:51:36,569 --> 00:51:37,669
[SPEAKER_03]: You want me to go with somebody else to come back?

928
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:38,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.

929
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:39,089
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, stress out.

930
00:51:39,309 --> 00:51:40,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me your FUs of the week.

931
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:45,671
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow, interesting list for me today, which kind of goes against the usual.

932
00:51:46,611 --> 00:51:50,752
[SPEAKER_20]: First and foremost, the parents still need a serious, well...

933
00:51:52,256 --> 00:51:55,737
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll let you fill it in however you like.

934
00:51:55,997 --> 00:51:57,037
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, boo-boo, perfect.

935
00:51:58,077 --> 00:52:00,438
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, my mom is still pissing me off to no end.

936
00:52:01,098 --> 00:52:05,499
[SPEAKER_20]: My dad, well, he still needs a lesson in pulling his head out of his ass, but that's a side issue.

937
00:52:06,219 --> 00:52:10,120
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, I want to send out an FU to my ex.

938
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,141
[SPEAKER_20]: Jeez, she's totally pissing me off like this.

939
00:52:15,141 --> 00:52:18,442
[SPEAKER_20]: She sent me this Dear John-like email and hasn't said a word to me since.

940
00:52:18,482 --> 00:52:19,942
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, what the hell, uh...

941
00:52:22,052 --> 00:52:31,639
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, next on the list, fuck life, and the general ideals that some people just don't understand.

942
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,522
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, they've got all their ideals and their fucking shit.

943
00:52:37,322 --> 00:52:38,563
[SPEAKER_20]: They don't like giving people things.

944
00:52:39,204 --> 00:52:39,684
[SPEAKER_20]: Hell not.

945
00:52:40,525 --> 00:52:41,125
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you know what?

946
00:52:42,446 --> 00:52:43,887
[SPEAKER_20]: Big steel dildo for you.

947
00:52:44,767 --> 00:52:45,468
[SPEAKER_20]: Right up the ass.

948
00:52:47,409 --> 00:52:47,729
[SPEAKER_19]: Got that.

949
00:52:47,749 --> 00:52:49,891
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the impression he and I didn't want to think of.

950
00:52:51,027 --> 00:52:57,196
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways, I think I'm about done.

951
00:53:01,062 --> 00:53:03,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, allergies must die.

952
00:53:04,126 --> 00:53:04,827
[SPEAKER_03]: We ready for Angel?

953
00:53:05,969 --> 00:53:06,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you remember?

954
00:53:10,703 --> 00:53:12,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, go to Loki, because he thought of another one.

955
00:53:14,005 --> 00:53:16,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, this is just a really short one, unlike the other ones.

956
00:53:16,847 --> 00:53:22,290
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to the Ralphs that we went to last night, because they were out of three important things.

957
00:53:22,871 --> 00:53:24,632
[SPEAKER_04]: One, large boxes of bagel bites.

958
00:53:24,932 --> 00:53:27,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Two, Maxim Magazine, and three, PSM.

959
00:53:28,694 --> 00:53:32,396
[SPEAKER_04]: All the things I wanted from the Ralphs, and they didn't have, so F you to the Ralphs.

960
00:53:32,757 --> 00:53:33,057
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

961
00:53:33,922 --> 00:53:35,485
[SPEAKER_16]: But in favor of the Rivals, they have Spumoni.

962
00:53:35,966 --> 00:53:36,807
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have Spumoni.

963
00:53:37,388 --> 00:53:38,170
[SPEAKER_03]: And chocolate whipped cream.

964
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:38,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

965
00:53:38,851 --> 00:53:39,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Ready whipped.

966
00:53:39,512 --> 00:53:40,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Chocolate ready whipped.

967
00:53:40,834 --> 00:53:41,535
[SPEAKER_16]: Chocolate with it.

968
00:53:42,758 --> 00:53:44,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm going to run through the chatroom FUs.

969
00:53:44,481 --> 00:53:45,923
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll come back to Angel if she thinks they're hers.

970
00:53:46,344 --> 00:53:46,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

971
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:50,452
[SPEAKER_03]: On with the chatroom FUs.

972
00:53:50,692 --> 00:53:53,494
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to having to come home on my birthday and missing Orange Lounge that day.

973
00:53:54,195 --> 00:53:56,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's okay because we do rebroadcast every Monday night.

974
00:53:56,657 --> 00:54:01,901
[SPEAKER_03]: And supposedly, I heard a rumor we do them on Thursday afternoons too when it actually works, but it hasn't for like the past month.

975
00:54:01,981 --> 00:54:04,843
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's always been like 15 minutes late or some shit.

976
00:54:04,883 --> 00:54:08,386
[SPEAKER_03]: So Thursdays at 2 we try to do them, but Mondays at 7 it always happens.

977
00:54:08,466 --> 00:54:10,548
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can always catch up on Orange Lounge that way.

978
00:54:11,806 --> 00:54:18,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Blackwab, fuck power outages, one messed up on my clocks last night, fuck my video card, I can play online games at the best pings but the shittiest frame rates.

979
00:54:19,347 --> 00:54:20,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you better keep your mouth shut on that.

980
00:54:21,228 --> 00:54:24,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck the timing belt in my car, it needs to be replaced and will cost near $800.

981
00:54:24,528 --> 00:54:26,489
[SPEAKER_03]: That kept me from rearing my car up to Davis' quarter.

982
00:54:26,789 --> 00:54:28,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, and fuck the city of Davis too.

983
00:54:28,449 --> 00:54:31,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck the owner at TAPEX that refuses... and it got cut off.

984
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:33,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Silly Mac.

985
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:36,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm guessing he refuses to turn up Macs or something like that.

986
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:40,391
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, yeah, he's reminding me I need to make an announcement, which I will do.

987
00:54:41,412 --> 00:54:54,483
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um... Okay... Nostylan says, uh... I want to say my fuck you of the week is or to script it sucks and doesn't work like it's supposed to dot dot.

988
00:54:55,183 --> 00:54:56,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Typical Nostylan English there.

989
00:54:56,564 --> 00:54:58,886
[SPEAKER_03]: That was beautiful.

990
00:54:58,907 --> 00:55:00,368
[SPEAKER_03]: StaplerX keeps it simple.

991
00:55:00,408 --> 00:55:01,589
[SPEAKER_03]: A big F you to Garbage Day.

992
00:55:01,789 --> 00:55:02,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey man, Garbage Day sucked.

993
00:55:05,532 --> 00:55:06,333
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a pushpin?

994
00:55:07,334 --> 00:55:07,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

995
00:55:07,927 --> 00:55:09,208
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, I need a pushpin.

996
00:55:09,569 --> 00:55:11,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I have any pushpins, Jumper.

997
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:12,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any After Use of the Week, Jumper?

998
00:55:13,653 --> 00:55:15,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, people who don't have pushpins.

999
00:55:16,036 --> 00:55:16,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1000
00:55:16,917 --> 00:55:17,798
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be some over there.

1001
00:55:17,858 --> 00:55:19,760
[SPEAKER_03]: See if there's a pushpin over on Brian's desk.

1002
00:55:21,281 --> 00:55:23,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Underneath the Cookies of Doom or in the little jar.

1003
00:55:23,443 --> 00:55:25,386
[SPEAKER_03]: See if there's some pushpins over there.

1004
00:55:26,847 --> 00:55:27,368
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry.

1005
00:55:28,929 --> 00:55:29,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1006
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:32,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, he said garbage.

1007
00:55:33,459 --> 00:55:34,780
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't count people saying it in chatroom.

1008
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't count people saying it.

1009
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't count it when people say slut in the chatroom.

1010
00:55:43,141 --> 00:55:43,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Joke's on already.

1011
00:55:43,781 --> 00:55:49,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, SoCalKick says, Fuck nothing because I just spent an awesome 27 hours with my best friend, Owen.

1012
00:55:49,762 --> 00:55:54,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, fuck school tomorrow even though I'd rather be at school than being lazy doing nothing at home.

1013
00:55:55,003 --> 00:55:56,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck people who are happy.

1014
00:55:56,624 --> 00:55:57,404
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't say that, I did.

1015
00:56:01,189 --> 00:56:03,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Slinky, fuck school and trends.

1016
00:56:04,651 --> 00:56:06,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck school really badly for having to go back tomorrow.

1017
00:56:10,094 --> 00:56:12,235
[SPEAKER_03]: EOSFEB says, fuck you too.

1018
00:56:12,996 --> 00:56:13,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit, nothing.

1019
00:56:13,976 --> 00:56:16,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to say fuck you, I just wanted to say slut.

1020

00:56:58,817 --> 00:57:00,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, whose fault is that, Mr. Man?

00:57:29,141 --> 00:57:40,207
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck coworkers who forget to come in at the time that they are scheduled because she thought she was supposed to come in at 4 and she was scheduled for 1.30 and I was supposed to leave at 2.

1036
00:57:40,387 --> 00:57:41,427
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck you!

1037
00:57:43,568 --> 00:57:45,889
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, and fuck my boss for trying to kill me with pepper.

1038
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:48,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Tried to kill you with pepper?

1039
00:57:48,411 --> 00:57:49,211
[SPEAKER_03]: How is that possible?

1040
00:57:50,512 --> 00:57:55,374
[SPEAKER_18]: She was making sandwiches and I was bending down to get the tomatoes out of the cooler and...

1041
00:57:56,155 --> 00:57:58,601
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, um, Pepper got in my nose.

1042
00:57:58,882 --> 00:57:59,824
[SPEAKER_18]: You bastard.

1043
00:58:03,191 --> 00:58:04,494
[SPEAKER_28]: Does Brad have any FUs of the week?

1044
00:58:08,491 --> 00:58:09,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I give him tack?

1045
00:58:09,191 --> 00:58:10,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's about all I got left.

1046
00:58:10,352 --> 00:58:11,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give him Alien World.

1047
00:58:12,412 --> 00:58:12,732
[SPEAKER_27]: What is it?

1048
00:58:13,312 --> 00:58:13,693
[SPEAKER_27]: Alien World.

1049
00:58:13,973 --> 00:58:14,933
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, sweet, thank you.

1050
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:17,174
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, not really, it's kind of a kind FU.

1051
00:58:17,394 --> 00:58:22,555
[SPEAKER_27]: FU to Keith for making us run away from Golfland, though we love him for it, because Scandia kicks ass.

1052
00:58:22,935 --> 00:58:23,835
[SPEAKER_17]: Yay!

1053
00:58:24,956 --> 00:58:25,536
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not an FU.

1054
00:58:25,556 --> 00:58:27,797
[SPEAKER_17]: I propose a group fuck you to Roosevelt Golfland.

1055
00:58:28,417 --> 00:58:30,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to fuck them, they have AIDS.

1056
00:58:34,578 --> 00:58:34,878
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1057
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the lovely FUs of the week.

1058
00:58:36,684 --> 00:58:39,733
[SPEAKER_03]: They suck because they broke Speed Demon and wouldn't fix it.

1059
00:58:39,773 --> 00:58:40,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Those bastards.

1060
00:58:42,225 --> 00:58:43,466
[SPEAKER_16]: Everything else is broken there.

1061
00:58:43,506 --> 00:58:43,966
[SPEAKER_16]: Why not?

1062
00:58:44,086 --> 00:58:47,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Slinky says F you to people who jam 7 quarters and break the coin slot for max 2.

1063
00:58:47,769 --> 00:58:48,489
[SPEAKER_03]: That does suck.

1064
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:51,651
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like the girl putting in her 12 tokens all at once.

1065
00:58:53,373 --> 00:58:54,473
[SPEAKER_07]: They go stupid.

1066
00:58:55,054 --> 00:58:57,295
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to Skrull.

1067
00:58:57,735 --> 00:58:58,856
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't want to go back.

1068
00:58:59,156 --> 00:59:00,878
[SPEAKER_07]: We will never want to go back.

1069
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:02,238
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Christmas vacation.

1070
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:03,960
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have to go to school.

1071
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to go to school either.

1072
00:59:07,702 --> 00:59:12,064
[SPEAKER_17]: I have to go to work, though.

1073
00:59:13,445 --> 00:59:15,085
[SPEAKER_20]: At least I'm not one of those corporate whore types.

1074
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:17,727
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, I can surf the internet at work.

1075
00:59:18,407 --> 00:59:18,887
[SPEAKER_20]: Me too.

1076
00:59:19,307 --> 00:59:22,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Daniel with 500 megs worth of sim files every day.

1077
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:25,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I got a late one.

1078
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:26,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a late one.

1079
00:59:26,211 --> 00:59:28,652
[SPEAKER_03]: It's from a new person in our chat room, so say hello to the new person.

1080
00:59:28,672 --> 00:59:29,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Better come late than never.

1081
00:59:31,013 --> 00:59:33,314
[SPEAKER_03]: This new person was asking about DDR in Auburn, by the way.

1082
00:59:33,334 --> 00:59:34,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the hell is their machine up there, Brad?

1083
00:59:34,755 --> 00:59:35,215
[SPEAKER_16]: Second mix.

1084
00:59:35,895 --> 00:59:39,257
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, they used to have a third mix at some Pizza Express.

1085
00:59:39,437 --> 00:59:40,317
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not there, I hear.

1086
00:59:40,637 --> 00:59:41,898
[SPEAKER_27]: But there is a second mix.

1087
00:59:42,118 --> 00:59:44,039
[SPEAKER_27]: Probably the only one in all of... I want to play!

1088
00:59:44,779 --> 00:59:48,220
[SPEAKER_27]: It's in the Signature Theaters, and the volume is all the way down.

1089
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,181
[SPEAKER_27]: So try playing a Beatmania with no sound.

1090
00:59:50,221 --> 00:59:50,801
[SPEAKER_27]: It's pretty fun.

1091
00:59:51,842 --> 00:59:56,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, Tadpole says, I want to say fuck you to my grandma for making me turn the volume down so low I can't hardly hear anything.

1092
00:59:57,024 --> 00:59:59,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you to Pizza Express for not having DDR anymore.

1093
01:00:00,005 --> 01:00:02,947
[SPEAKER_03]: And a great big fuck you to gas stations for gas being so damn expensive.

1094
01:00:03,107 --> 01:00:03,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1095
01:00:04,847 --> 01:00:05,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck games!

1096
01:00:05,387 --> 01:00:05,887
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I don't try.

1097
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:15,571
[SPEAKER_11]: TREATMAG!

1098
01:00:15,591 --> 01:00:16,171
[SPEAKER_03]: TREATMAG!

1099
01:00:16,431 --> 01:00:23,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that one about the seven coins and the max, too, was actually from Twen, but I somehow missed it, because... He doesn't count.

1100
01:00:24,254 --> 01:00:24,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1101
01:00:25,614 --> 01:00:29,476
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I had it on... I thought his thing was for Loki.

1102
01:00:29,496 --> 01:00:30,536
[SPEAKER_03]: He said it was a message for Loki.

1103
01:00:30,576 --> 01:00:30,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1104
01:00:31,036 --> 01:00:31,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, who cares?

1105
01:00:33,097 --> 01:00:33,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

1106
01:00:35,427 --> 01:00:36,547
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all of our FUs of the week.

1107
01:00:36,567 --> 01:00:37,448
[SPEAKER_03]: That was beautiful, wasn't it?

1108
01:00:38,028 --> 01:00:39,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to another?

1109
01:00:39,888 --> 01:00:42,709
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to talk more about DDR?

1110
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:45,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk to our guests that we don't have here on the show very much.

1111
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:46,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Like never.

1112
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:49,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk to Stress on DDR Angel.

1113
01:00:50,931 --> 01:00:51,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1114
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:53,192
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to make a comment.

1115
01:00:54,412 --> 01:00:55,932
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that fort.

1116
01:00:56,373 --> 01:00:57,333
[SPEAKER_08]: That fort was cool.

1117
01:00:57,733 --> 01:00:58,333
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, yes.

1118
01:00:58,473 --> 01:01:01,594
[SPEAKER_20]: I live up in the boondocks up in northern...

1119
01:01:02,543 --> 01:01:03,543
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I'm out there.

1120
01:01:04,063 --> 01:01:06,684
[SPEAKER_20]: If you know where Santa Rosa is, you're likely to find me there.

1121
01:01:08,424 --> 01:01:09,024
[SPEAKER_20]: The fort is cool.

1122
01:01:09,764 --> 01:01:11,405
[SPEAKER_03]: The fort is damn sexy.

1123
01:01:13,305 --> 01:01:17,706
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't know if people live there, because we do see smoke every occasionally, but nobody ever really checks it out.

1124
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:19,426
[SPEAKER_22]: Go figure.

1125
01:01:20,106 --> 01:01:22,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Could it be those big graffiti signs that say, keep out of the fort?

1126
01:01:24,027 --> 01:01:24,747
[SPEAKER_20]: Very well possible.

1127
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:29,208
[SPEAKER_20]: Of course, you know, we should still make that image for Jamie.

1128
01:01:30,768 --> 01:01:31,688
[SPEAKER_20]: The Jamie New World Order.

1129
01:01:32,307 --> 01:01:33,007
[SPEAKER_20]: Beginning in the Fort.

1130
01:01:33,687 --> 01:01:35,508
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll start my own cult, we'll move into a compound.

1131
01:01:36,928 --> 01:01:37,228
[SPEAKER_16]: Woot!

1132
01:01:38,009 --> 01:01:42,070
[SPEAKER_22]: It's only going after some dark black forest.

1133
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:45,891
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, it actually might be considered a dark black forest.

1134
01:01:46,391 --> 01:01:50,832
[SPEAKER_20]: But of course, Jamie will have the interesting opportunity to meet said forest.

1135
01:01:51,772 --> 01:01:53,213
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll be the army of stoics.

1136
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:58,874
[SPEAKER_16]: And I will have a dark black forest, because I don't particularly care for that song.

1137
01:02:00,215 --> 01:02:00,855
[SPEAKER_16]: It's overplayed.

1138
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:14,691
[SPEAKER_16]: But I want my own compound where I can make people... I want to recruit stupid people in this compound and then make them die face first in a pool of jello.

1139
01:02:15,672 --> 01:02:18,474
[SPEAKER_18]: I say we all quit our jobs and move into the fort!

1140
01:02:19,255 --> 01:02:20,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we must move into the fort.

1141
01:02:21,277 --> 01:02:22,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge live from the fort next week.

1142
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:23,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1143
01:02:25,501 --> 01:02:26,161
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's the fort.

1144
01:02:26,762 --> 01:02:27,803
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, Angel?

1145
01:02:27,823 --> 01:02:28,964
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't heard much from you this show.

1146
01:02:30,842 --> 01:02:32,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did you start playing DDR?

1147
01:02:32,283 --> 01:02:33,323
[SPEAKER_03]: What got you into DDR?

1148
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:36,465
[SPEAKER_03]: What made you, was it the flashing seizure lights with the music?

1149
01:02:39,886 --> 01:02:40,786
[SPEAKER_17]: The truth or other?

1150
01:02:41,267 --> 01:02:41,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Other.

1151
01:02:42,647 --> 01:02:43,768
[SPEAKER_03]: We never tell the truth in the show.

1152
01:02:45,949 --> 01:02:46,509
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1153
01:02:47,089 --> 01:02:49,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so most of us don't know why we play DDR.

1154
01:02:51,511 --> 01:02:52,632
[SPEAKER_18]: I got conned into it.

1155
01:02:52,872 --> 01:02:54,833
[SPEAKER_03]: You got conned into it, good, good answer.

1156
01:02:55,453 --> 01:02:56,813
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I couldn't stop.

1157
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:58,334
[SPEAKER_18]: And I still haven't stopped.

1158
01:02:59,094 --> 01:02:59,475
[SPEAKER_18]: Because...

1159
01:03:02,248 --> 01:03:02,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, stress out.

1160
01:03:03,009 --> 01:03:04,190
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an STD all of its own.

1161
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:05,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's an STD all of its own.

1162
01:03:05,591 --> 01:03:06,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Is DDR a disease?

1163
01:03:07,012 --> 01:03:07,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it is.

1164
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:09,093
It's an addiction.

1165
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:11,995
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an addiction and I need help.

1166
01:03:13,076 --> 01:03:14,858
[SPEAKER_20]: Unfortunately, they don't have a 12-step program for this yet.

1167
01:03:15,398 --> 01:03:17,760
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're not going to, because whoever tries to start one, I'll kill.

1168
01:03:18,841 --> 01:03:23,504
[SPEAKER_27]: It's an addiction, like crack, cocaine, and alcohol, and then laundry burger baskets, and things like that.

1169
01:03:23,804 --> 01:03:25,346
[SPEAKER_16]: It's an addiction that's good for you.

1170
01:03:26,026 --> 01:03:26,346
[SPEAKER_16]: Vanilla crack.

1171
01:03:26,366 --> 01:03:27,787
[SPEAKER_16]: It's chock full of... Vanilla crack!

1172
01:03:29,249 --> 01:03:29,629
[SPEAKER_16]: Propel.

1173
01:03:30,475 --> 01:03:33,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, my name is the 23rd Magus and I'm a Bimani addict.

1174
01:03:36,076 --> 01:03:36,816
[SPEAKER_20]: Get me a gun.

1175
01:03:37,837 --> 01:03:39,757
[SPEAKER_20]: Isn't this the point where I'm supposed to clap or do something?

1176
01:03:39,797 --> 01:03:43,598
[SPEAKER_20]: Isn't the point where someone's supposed to go, Hi, Magus.

1177
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:45,678
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Magus.

1178
01:03:45,698 --> 01:03:46,358
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

1179
01:03:46,899 --> 01:03:47,699
[SPEAKER_20]: See, I'm feeling better now.

1180
01:03:48,399 --> 01:03:49,179
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

1181
01:03:49,279 --> 01:03:54,700
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that it's really the space aliens came and invented the Bimani series.

1182
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:55,340
[SPEAKER_16]: It was Zim.

1183
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,521
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it was Trans Race.

1184
01:03:58,906 --> 01:04:08,448
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the great space co-gal Tran came on her flying saucer with her cat and her snowmobile and decided to make us all bimaniatics.

1185
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:09,868
[SPEAKER_20]: Ooh, the snowblower of doom.

1186
01:04:10,488 --> 01:04:11,569
[SPEAKER_16]: You haven't seen the video.

1187
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:13,029
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's show them the video for some time.

1188
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:14,729
[SPEAKER_08]: This is DDR, not the last Starfighter.

1189
01:04:16,550 --> 01:04:17,270
[SPEAKER_27]: It is like that.

1190
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:20,530
[SPEAKER_27]: See, they're going to make us into an incredible race of rhythm dancing machines and stuff.

1191
01:04:20,751 --> 01:04:24,631
[SPEAKER_27]: And at the last war, at the end of the world, we're all going to have to dance off against the aliens.

1192
01:04:25,531 --> 01:04:27,052
[SPEAKER_04]: That would work, except for one thing.

1193
01:04:27,112 --> 01:04:27,752
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not Asian.

1194
01:04:30,871 --> 01:04:31,952
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, but I am!

1195
01:04:32,573 --> 01:04:35,115
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, exactly, see, we- Kill any deaths to the kneecaps!

1196
01:04:35,615 --> 01:04:38,858
[SPEAKER_27]: Say, hey, I may be honky with no rhythm, but- STILL BE A DEATH!

1197
01:04:38,878 --> 01:04:39,398
STILL BE A DEATH!

1198
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:43,221
[SPEAKER_27]: I may be honky with no rhythm, but there are some Asians here who can help.

1199
01:04:43,301 --> 01:04:47,605
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, if you count maybe about, oh, 150 years back, I could qualify.

1200
01:04:47,625 --> 01:04:57,033
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, late fuck you to pizza for being so damn yummy and good that I eat it all and I get, like, fat in my arteries and I die.

1201
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:01,223
[SPEAKER_20]: ProPublicu.

1202
01:05:01,283 --> 01:05:09,028
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, anyways, as far as the beginning of my Bomani DDR type addiction, it was because of Angel.

1203
01:05:09,569 --> 01:05:14,512
[SPEAKER_20]: It was she who conned me into it, and ever since, I don't quite know what's become of me.

1204
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:17,854
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, but you have gone from one step to five.

1205
01:05:17,874 --> 01:05:19,075
[SPEAKER_18]: All in one day!

1206
01:05:19,195 --> 01:05:20,136
[SPEAKER_18]: Have a murder cookie.

1207
01:05:21,016 --> 01:05:21,957
[SPEAKER_18]: They're death-errific.

1208
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:23,498
[SPEAKER_16]: Death cookie!

1209
01:05:23,558 --> 01:05:25,339
[SPEAKER_16]: Death cookie!

1210
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,942
[SPEAKER_16]: For the people who aren't seeing these, we have holiday Oreos.

1211
01:05:30,589 --> 01:05:33,392
[SPEAKER_16]: They can't call them Christmas Oreos because it's not politically correct.

1212
01:05:33,713 --> 01:05:36,195
[SPEAKER_16]: So they're holiday Oreos with red filling.

1213
01:05:36,836 --> 01:05:39,659
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're red like they're stained with blood.

1214
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:41,000
[SPEAKER_28]: Like a tampon.

1215
01:05:43,953 --> 01:05:45,553
[SPEAKER_16]: Now they're menstrual cookies!

1216
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:47,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1217
01:05:47,955 --> 01:05:50,596
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll call it, we'll call it, we'll call it Mencios.

1218
01:05:51,577 --> 01:05:52,378
[SPEAKER_03]: That's disgusting.

1219
01:05:52,438 --> 01:05:52,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:55,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I missed, I feel bad.

1221
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,861
[SPEAKER_16]: It tastes like, it tastes like a cycle.

1222
01:05:58,061 --> 01:06:01,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel bad because I forgot to check the mailbag for the FUs of the week.

1223
01:06:01,063 --> 01:06:01,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it!

1224
01:06:01,643 --> 01:06:03,544
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one sitting in there, so I've got to do it.

1225
01:06:03,644 --> 01:06:04,945
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a late FU, sorry.

1226
01:06:05,465 --> 01:06:05,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1227
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:07,827
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't always send an email though if you want.

1228
01:06:07,847 --> 01:06:10,028
[SPEAKER_16]: No, give them my music because I want to hear more tacks.

1229
01:06:10,208 --> 01:06:10,849
[SPEAKER_03]: You wanna hear more TAC?

1230
01:06:10,869 --> 01:06:12,670
[SPEAKER_03]: How about the TAC song you wouldn't let me play for anyone else?

1231
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:13,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1232
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:13,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1233
01:06:15,432 --> 01:06:17,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait, he requested a song for his FU, should I give it to him?

1234
01:06:19,715 --> 01:06:22,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, I never let people have their requested songs, so deal.

1235
01:06:24,299 --> 01:06:25,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'll be nice.

1236
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:26,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Only because we forgot.

1237
01:06:27,181 --> 01:06:27,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1238
01:06:28,782 --> 01:06:29,463

[SPEAKER_03]: Muheimer says, yay for drunk parents and their friends making Drunky the Snowman outside my house on New Year's Eve by decorating him with beer, noisemakers, and a hat.

1240
01:06:39,751 --> 01:06:40,772
[SPEAKER_17]: That is a winner.

1241
01:06:40,932 --> 01:06:43,233
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the best FU I think I've ever read on this show.

1242
01:06:43,273 --> 01:06:45,194
[SPEAKER_17]: There's going to be a bunch of drunk squirrels running around.

1243
01:06:45,914 --> 01:06:48,456
[SPEAKER_03]: That was worth going back to the FU segment for right there.

1244
01:06:48,556 --> 01:06:49,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Drunky the Snowman.

1245

[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone point and laugh to this kid at my swim meet today who friggin' fell off the starting block.

1251
01:07:19,416 --> 01:07:21,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen anything like that in all my years of swimming.

1252
01:07:22,299 --> 01:07:24,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though if it were me falling off the block, I'd kill myself.

1253
01:07:24,881 --> 01:07:25,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha-ha at him.

1254

[SPEAKER_16]: You're welcome.

1344
01:16:59,827 --> 01:17:04,008
[SPEAKER_03]: We were going to do the match game coming back into this segment, except we didn't have enough time to prepare, so we're going to hold that off.

1345
01:17:04,028 --> 01:17:05,749
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do that in about a half hour.

1348
01:17:09,071 --> 01:17:09,471
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?

1349
01:17:09,851 --> 01:17:10,271
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's up?

1350
01:17:10,291 --> 01:17:11,832
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have anything else to talk about.

1351
01:17:11,892 --> 01:17:13,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have to do everything?

1352
01:17:14,562 --> 01:17:16,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, let's hear a sim update before we get to listless.

1353
01:17:16,643 --> 01:17:17,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we'll do a listless.

1354
01:17:17,663 --> 01:17:18,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do a sim update.

1355
01:17:18,264 --> 01:17:18,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Sim update.

1356
01:17:19,364 --> 01:17:25,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally, we can stop playing DDRPC if you haven't done it yet, because they released the last stupid character set.

1357
01:17:26,127 --> 01:17:28,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that anyone even fucking cares anymore, because I don't.

1358
01:17:29,248 --> 01:17:30,489
[SPEAKER_08]: The game sucks ass.

1359
01:17:30,949 --> 01:17:34,731
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you care, it's some stupid princess and some prince guy, and I don't care.

1360
01:17:35,131 --> 01:17:35,671
[SPEAKER_08]: It's crap.

1361
01:17:36,191 --> 01:17:36,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

1362
01:17:36,812 --> 01:17:37,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy.

01:17:37,712 --> 01:17:39,453
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're there for your enjoyment.

1364
01:17:40,351 --> 01:17:42,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Aside from that, Tournament Mix 3 is wrapping up.

1365
01:17:42,373 --> 01:17:45,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Tomorrow should have the results.

1366
01:17:45,955 --> 01:17:48,757
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd have to say this has been the worst run tournament I've ever seen.

1367
01:17:49,517 --> 01:17:51,939
[SPEAKER_26]: And they should all burn in hell for it.

1368
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:53,540
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm going to do better for it.

1369
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,721
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to do a better tournament than they will.

1370
01:17:56,202 --> 01:17:57,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I own them.

1371
01:17:57,963 --> 01:17:59,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of which, how did MakeEditGetPorn go?

1372
01:18:02,566 --> 01:18:03,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know what?

1373
01:18:03,467 --> 01:18:06,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people just don't understand this concept of deadlines.

1374
01:18:06,669 --> 01:18:07,289
[SPEAKER_08]: So you know what?

1375
01:18:07,629 --> 01:18:09,731
[SPEAKER_08]: The people sent me edits to GetPorn, the people didn't.

1376
01:18:10,572 --> 01:18:11,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Go fuck themselves!

1377
01:18:13,014 --> 01:18:14,255
[SPEAKER_16]: You should give me porn anyway.

1378
01:18:16,357 --> 01:18:17,959
[SPEAKER_26]: I know, I have plenty of porn to give away.

1379
01:18:17,999 --> 01:18:23,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people don't like porn at my work for some reason, I don't know why, so they just put it in the coffee room and I take it.

1380
01:18:24,164 --> 01:18:25,285
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that porn is funny.

1381
01:18:26,266 --> 01:18:26,887
[SPEAKER_27]: But, yeah.

1382
01:18:27,447 --> 01:18:28,248
[SPEAKER_27]: Porn blows.

1383
01:18:28,789 --> 01:18:29,089
[SPEAKER_27]: Get it?

1384
01:18:29,469 --> 01:18:29,750
[SPEAKER_27]: Hello?

1385
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:29,810
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi!

1386
01:18:31,451 --> 01:18:32,932
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, so that's what's going on.

1387
01:18:33,552 --> 01:18:44,336
[SPEAKER_08]: As I mentioned slightly earlier, there's going to be a Leech from Loki 2.0 coming up because I got web hosting thanks to DDR Alama from DDR Mania X and Chris Stanford from the Set Mania site.

1388
01:18:44,376 --> 01:18:49,518
[SPEAKER_08]: They're giving me web hosting with unlimited space and unlimited bandwidth, so I get to put whatever the fuck I want on there.

1389
01:18:49,998 --> 01:18:52,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess they're trying to challenge me to crash the boards or something, but...

1390
01:18:53,579 --> 01:18:57,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever, so I'm going to put all my sim files on there slowly in theme packs.

1391
01:18:57,062 --> 01:19:00,265
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do interviews with step file makers and that kind of thing.

1392
01:19:00,365 --> 01:19:02,567
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's pretty much what's coming up.

1393
01:19:02,627 --> 01:19:07,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now I'm just redoing the design of the site because I have to try to figure out how the fuck to sort 2100 step files.

1394
01:19:10,234 --> 01:19:10,854
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be fun.

1395
01:19:12,035 --> 01:19:14,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Aside from that, do check out Bimani Style.

1396
01:19:14,236 --> 01:19:19,720
[SPEAKER_03]: They're putting up all week long the new DDR Extreme DWIs.

1397
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:24,242
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, they're the thing for the Legend of Max and Paranoia Survivor samples.

1398
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:28,825
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely check them out if you haven't yet for sim files and that kind of thing.

1399
01:19:30,786 --> 01:19:36,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, aside from that, not too much going on other than DDR Extreme coming out and us finding out more about it.

1400
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:40,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like we pretty much, you know, we know what songs are going to be hidden in there.

1401
01:19:40,772 --> 01:19:44,773
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have a continued little rant, sort of.

1402
01:19:45,173 --> 01:19:54,677
[SPEAKER_26]: Basically, this is a fuck you to everyone that said I was wrong about Sakura Bean and fucking DDR Extreme because I knew I called it a long ass time ago and all of you naysayers can burn in hell!

1403
01:19:58,779 --> 01:19:59,279
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's all.

1404
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:00,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1405
01:20:02,371 --> 01:20:06,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I went back over to the mailbag to look at some... Bag.

1406
01:20:06,555 --> 01:20:11,540
[SPEAKER_03]: To see if we've got... I hate you.

1407
01:20:12,821 --> 01:20:14,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to see if we got any mail, and guess what?

1408
01:20:14,823 --> 01:20:15,183
[SPEAKER_03]: We do.

1409
01:20:15,304 --> 01:20:19,387
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a question from SoCalKicks, of course.

1410
01:20:19,888 --> 01:20:22,210
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a question specifically for Loki.

1411
01:20:23,732 --> 01:20:26,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I have the Robotech Macross Saga DVDs?

1412
01:20:28,962 --> 01:20:31,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if I had them to give, then yeah.

1413
01:20:32,305 --> 01:20:33,606
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't, so no.

1414
01:20:34,626 --> 01:20:35,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I have some more porn?

1415
01:20:35,767 --> 01:20:36,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I have titles I like.

1416
01:20:38,609 --> 01:20:43,953
[SPEAKER_03]: All I get is the stupid Playboy shit, and so, you know, I pretty much gave you all the, well, some of the new stuff.

1417
01:20:44,514 --> 01:20:45,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, yeah.

1418
01:20:46,615 --> 01:20:47,576
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, whatever I have.

1419
01:20:47,596 --> 01:20:51,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, he says at the end, PayPal may come if two or more of the requests are met.

1420
01:20:51,819 --> 01:20:55,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how two or more is possible, because you only made two requests!

1421
01:20:56,742 --> 01:20:58,123
[SPEAKER_03]: You're being edumacated, apparently.

1422
01:20:58,143 --> 01:20:58,503
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

1423
01:20:58,563 --> 01:21:07,606
[SPEAKER_16]: If he just actually came up here to visit us instead, he can come to my house and not only watch all the Robotech stuff, but watch all the Macross stuff, because I happen to have the whole box set.

1424
01:21:07,866 --> 01:21:11,928
[SPEAKER_04]: And Final Fuck X, which I got a copy of last night.

1425
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:15,970
[SPEAKER_16]: Yo, HP tastes good.

1426
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:16,810
[SPEAKER_16]: Did it turn out all right?

1427
01:21:17,779 --> 01:21:18,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was cool.

1428
01:21:18,519 --> 01:21:20,440
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just VCD quality, whatever, you know.

1429
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:23,720
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same as the other VCDs I have from Japan that are porn.

1430
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:24,421
[SPEAKER_03]: They're censored.

1431
01:21:25,541 --> 01:21:26,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Censored porn sucks.

1432
01:21:26,701 --> 01:21:28,341
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like made-for-TV porn.

1433
01:21:30,002 --> 01:21:32,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm opening up another email here.

1434
01:21:33,123 --> 01:21:36,163
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya wants to know, when will you put more of an SMA into rotation?

1435
01:21:36,203 --> 01:21:37,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a request for one song.

1436
01:21:37,524 --> 01:21:38,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear Red Hot.

1437
01:21:38,404 --> 01:21:39,004
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool.

1438
01:21:41,544 --> 01:21:42,245
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, wow.

1439
01:21:45,289 --> 01:21:50,831
[SPEAKER_16]: All of my MP3s, by the way, because I've had all the Vanessa May stuff, they're gone.

1440
01:21:51,331 --> 01:21:52,351
[SPEAKER_16]: Because guess what?

1441
01:21:52,431 --> 01:21:53,372
[SPEAKER_16]: My hard drive broke.

1442
01:21:53,952 --> 01:21:56,192
[SPEAKER_16]: So you send me RedHot, it'll make it into rotation.

1443
01:21:57,053 --> 01:21:58,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we'll get RedHot into rotation.

1444
01:21:59,693 --> 01:22:01,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn you, you Vanessa May damn whore.

1445
01:22:01,894 --> 01:22:02,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie made a noose.

1446
01:22:03,575 --> 01:22:05,535
[SPEAKER_27]: She has a noose on her neck and I have a noose on my neck.

1447
01:22:05,555 --> 01:22:06,115
[SPEAKER_27]: That's cute.

1448
01:22:06,416 --> 01:22:07,156
[SPEAKER_27]: This is weird.

1449
01:22:09,296 --> 01:22:10,977
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, dual mic penetration.

1450
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:15,400
[SPEAKER_16]: I want my news back.

1451
01:22:18,001 --> 01:22:18,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1452
01:22:18,461 --> 01:22:19,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll fix it, Kim.

1453
01:22:20,581 --> 01:22:22,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about some show news.

1454
01:22:22,142 --> 01:22:25,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Things that have happened in the past and coming in the future to the show.

1455
01:22:26,263 --> 01:22:26,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Boners.

1456
01:22:27,743 --> 01:22:28,623
[SPEAKER_14]: You said coming.

1457
01:22:29,723 --> 01:22:30,864
[SPEAKER_16]: You slut.

1458
01:22:31,244 --> 01:22:31,924
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry, Jamie.

1459
01:22:31,964 --> 01:22:32,584
[SPEAKER_28]: What did you say?

1460
01:22:32,604 --> 01:22:33,764
[SPEAKER_28]: I said you're a slut.

1461
01:22:33,784 --> 01:22:37,025
[SPEAKER_28]: $5 Saki Saki.

1462
01:22:37,125 --> 01:22:39,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you all night long if you let me sing for you.

1463
01:22:42,785 --> 01:22:44,765
[SPEAKER_27]: I am Australian, but I sound Asian.

1464
01:22:44,785 --> 01:22:46,526
[SPEAKER_27]: I thought she was Italian.

1465
01:22:46,806 --> 01:22:47,406
[SPEAKER_27]: She's Australian.

1466
01:22:48,666 --> 01:22:50,066
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not boring, Australian.

1467
01:22:50,186 --> 01:22:52,207
[SPEAKER_27]: How many Australian singers and actors do we need?

1468
01:22:53,407 --> 01:22:54,647
We have Olivia Newton-John.

1469
01:22:55,187 --> 01:22:56,187
[SPEAKER_16]: Olivia Newton-John's cool.

1470
01:22:56,787 --> 01:22:57,427
[SPEAKER_27]: She's great.

1471
01:22:57,788 --> 01:22:59,928
[SPEAKER_27]: Have you never been mellow?

1472
01:22:59,948 --> 01:23:04,329
[SPEAKER_16]: I swear I'm going to make every person in this room watch Xanadu with me one night.

1473
01:23:06,269 --> 01:23:06,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sick.

1474
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:11,990
[SPEAKER_20]: Personally, though, from the outside coming in... Your eyes still work.

1475
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,261
[SPEAKER_16]: This is... You made me watch Showgirls.

1476
01:23:14,861 --> 01:23:15,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I did make her watch Showgirls.

1477
01:23:16,002 --> 01:23:17,963
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good movie.

1478
01:23:18,324 --> 01:23:19,524
[SPEAKER_26]: For me to poop on.

1479
01:23:22,386 --> 01:23:24,027
[SPEAKER_20]: I never actually thought it would be something like this.

1480
01:23:25,168 --> 01:23:28,110
[SPEAKER_20]: But, when you enter this... Whoa, hello!

1481
01:23:29,211 --> 01:23:29,991
[SPEAKER_20]: I just got a little show there.

1482
01:23:30,011 --> 01:23:31,572
[SPEAKER_03]: When did this studio turn into a gay nightclub?

1483
01:23:31,872 --> 01:23:34,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop that.

1484
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:36,735
[SPEAKER_20]: He almost gave me a lap dance.

1485
01:23:38,797 --> 01:23:40,718
[SPEAKER_20]: The weird part about it is I was still standing.

1486
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:45,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you just sit on this?

1487
01:23:50,392 --> 01:23:51,192
[SPEAKER_20]: And now he's been tied.

1488
01:23:52,973 --> 01:23:53,773
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry, you had a thought?

1489
01:23:54,073 --> 01:23:57,254
[SPEAKER_20]: No, no, it was coming into this from the outside.

1490
01:23:58,174 --> 01:23:59,255
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I said it again.

1491
01:23:59,575 --> 01:24:01,635
[SPEAKER_20]: Look who's the dirty slut now!

1492
01:24:03,556 --> 01:24:05,357
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe coming to the outward thing.

1493
01:24:05,397 --> 01:24:05,677
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh-oh.

1494
01:24:13,311 --> 01:24:15,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I have news.

1495
01:24:15,192 --> 01:24:17,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to get to Orange Lounge news because this is actually really big news.

1496
01:24:18,173 --> 01:24:20,735
[SPEAKER_03]: We've made our first bestest friends on the interweb.

1497
01:24:21,715 --> 01:24:24,416
[SPEAKER_03]: And those buddies of ours... I saw your tummy.

1498
01:24:25,517 --> 01:24:26,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo!

1499
01:24:26,897 --> 01:24:27,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm blind!

1500
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:33,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Our new bestest friends on the interweb are located at eastofosaka.net.

1501
01:24:36,482 --> 01:24:39,083
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jamie had to do a lot of that to get this to happen.

1502
01:24:39,103 --> 01:24:39,804
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1503
01:24:39,844 --> 01:24:39,804
37?

1504
01:24:40,404 --> 01:24:42,125
[SPEAKER_18]: In a while?

1505
01:24:43,194 --> 01:24:45,176
[SPEAKER_18]: Turn it to suck any dick on your way out of the parking lot.

1506
01:24:45,436 --> 01:24:46,237
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, you get back here.

1507
01:24:48,419 --> 01:24:48,760
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1508
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:52,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, eastofosaka.net, they're our friends, our bestest friends on the net.

1509
01:24:52,643 --> 01:24:55,366
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've led us onto their forums.

1510
01:24:55,426 --> 01:25:00,251
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you thought the Orange Lounge forums sucked on the little free thing we had, then fine.

1511
01:25:00,571 --> 01:25:03,875
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got cool forums now because they're a part of the eastofosaka.net forums.

1512
01:25:03,935 --> 01:25:06,918
[SPEAKER_03]: So my avatar owns all of you.

1513
01:25:08,843 --> 01:25:12,505
[SPEAKER_16]: I still think mine's cooler, because I actually spent a long time working on it.

1514
01:25:13,026 --> 01:25:19,710
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, it's the same one I use on DDR Freak, and on Sub Squad Board, and I would use it on Sack of Money, but we can't have them.

1515
01:25:23,913 --> 01:25:24,853
[SPEAKER_20]: We have one thing to say.

1516
01:25:25,534 --> 01:25:27,275
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't love us!

1517
01:25:28,916 --> 01:25:30,257
[SPEAKER_28]: What the hell was that for?

1518
01:25:30,497 --> 01:25:31,097
[SPEAKER_16]: We love you.

1519
01:25:32,658 --> 01:25:33,719
[SPEAKER_28]: You guys all ran away.

1520
01:25:41,785 --> 01:25:42,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I love everybody.

1521
01:25:42,807 --> 01:25:44,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, you guys, I'm a huge slut, okay?

1522
01:25:44,649 --> 01:25:50,736
[SPEAKER_16]: I love everybody.

1523
01:25:50,776 --> 01:25:51,897
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting a lap dance.

1524
01:25:52,037 --> 01:25:53,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Three of them, all at once.

1525
01:25:53,712 --> 01:25:55,273
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to go hide in the corner.

1526
01:25:55,414 --> 01:26:07,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the link to the new boards are being posted in the chat room now, or if you are too lazy to follow links in the chat room, just go to our site, orangelounge.skie.cx, click on forums, and it takes you to the new forums.

1527
01:26:07,865 --> 01:26:08,986
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you don't, we'll kick your ass.

1528
01:26:10,207 --> 01:26:10,967
[SPEAKER_16]: You'll lose our love.

1529
01:26:11,868 --> 01:26:14,891
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to lose your love tonight.

1530
01:26:17,151 --> 01:26:17,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1531
01:26:18,772 --> 01:26:20,252
[SPEAKER_03]: So, definitely check out the new forums.

1532
01:26:21,653 --> 01:26:27,295
[SPEAKER_03]: And next week, next Saturday, is a pretty nifty tournament going on in Fremont.

1533
01:26:27,415 --> 01:26:27,995
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, go.

1534
01:26:28,276 --> 01:26:34,078
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is the first time, besides Shaft, that all three hosts will be attending a tournament together.

1535
01:26:34,098 --> 01:26:34,578
[SPEAKER_03]: All three of us.

1536
01:26:34,618 --> 01:26:35,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I correct?

1537
01:26:35,618 --> 01:26:36,599
[SPEAKER_16]: One of them might be competing.

1538
01:26:37,099 --> 01:26:37,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1539
01:26:38,019 --> 01:26:38,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're going to compete?

1540
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:39,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I want GPA.

1541
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:41,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, very cool.

1542
01:26:41,101 --> 01:26:41,921
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to compete, Loki.

1543
01:26:41,981 --> 01:26:43,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, okay, we'll go cheer Jamie on.

1544
01:26:43,422 --> 01:26:44,342
[SPEAKER_16]: I may or may not GPA.

1545
01:26:45,262 --> 01:26:46,003
[SPEAKER_03]: DCB wants you to pre-reg.

1546
01:27:04,424 --> 01:27:09,509
[SPEAKER_16]: If I have the money to, I'm getting Keyboard Mania tomorrow, so my money's kind of tight.

1547
01:27:09,829 --> 01:27:10,109
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1548
01:27:10,369 --> 01:27:11,190
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll bring the bat, though.

1549
01:27:11,811 --> 01:27:13,532
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, we need to get new bats to have everyone sign.

1550
01:27:13,812 --> 01:27:14,713
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, okay, that's a good idea.

1551
01:27:14,793 --> 01:27:19,317
[SPEAKER_16]: I've got to go buy a new orange bat, because everyone signed them at the Mountain Mike's tourney, so I have to buy new bats.

1552
01:27:20,706 --> 01:27:21,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1553
01:27:21,527 --> 01:27:23,609
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the link to the page right there.

1554
01:27:23,669 --> 01:27:31,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Radbeats.com slash TildaKillerPal slash Fremont2.html You'll never remember that, so just click the link in the chatroom.

1555
01:27:31,675 --> 01:27:31,996
[SPEAKER_16]: Internet.

1556
01:27:33,637 --> 01:27:34,618
[SPEAKER_16]: The interweb.

1557
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:41,185
[SPEAKER_03]: You're showing us pictures of... Oh, it's the Ghetto DDR Extreme 8th Mix sign from Stockton Golf Line.

1558
01:27:41,205 --> 01:27:41,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1559
01:27:41,725 --> 01:27:42,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.

1560
01:27:43,347 --> 01:27:48,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of which, we got to check out the nice Ghetto Max 2 that they're giving away in the cyber returning.

1561
01:27:48,572 --> 01:27:49,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my lord.

1562
01:27:49,152 --> 01:27:50,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they clean it up.

1563
01:27:50,714 --> 01:27:52,435
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they clean it up a little.

1564
01:27:52,455 --> 01:27:53,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to that tourney a lot.

1565
01:27:54,197 --> 01:27:56,539
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a machine, but it's not much of a machine.

1566
01:27:57,700 --> 01:27:59,302
[SPEAKER_03]: We got another question in our inbox.

1567
01:27:59,402 --> 01:28:00,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll answer it.

1568
01:28:02,808 --> 01:28:03,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like Big Cock?

1569
01:28:04,009 --> 01:28:05,110
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a rude question.

1570
01:28:05,130 --> 01:28:06,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you'll want to answer that one.

1571
01:28:06,511 --> 01:28:07,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

1572
01:28:07,031 --> 01:28:07,291
I do.

1573
01:28:07,712 --> 01:28:08,592
I love Big Cock.

1574
01:28:09,853 --> 01:28:12,575
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll have, okay, we'll have a real guest.

1575
01:28:13,596 --> 01:28:16,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, what's the question?

1576
01:28:16,117 --> 01:28:19,340
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to know when Orange Lime, no style wants to know when Orange Lime's going to have a real guest.

1577
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:20,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so...

1578
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:24,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you, Nostyle!

1579
01:28:25,401 --> 01:28:27,582
[SPEAKER_20]: I will shove my foot in your ass.

1580
01:28:27,962 --> 01:28:31,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, if you can hook up porn stars coming over here, I'm all for it, okay?

1581
01:28:33,226 --> 01:28:35,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you know, I think somebody just wanted to have their name read on the radio.

1582
01:28:38,529 --> 01:28:40,050
[SPEAKER_03]: You had something you wanted to say, Jamie?

1583
01:28:40,090 --> 01:28:42,231
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to go jump off a bridge with that thing around your neck, are you?

1584
01:28:42,271 --> 01:28:43,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Big cock.

1585
01:28:44,952 --> 01:28:46,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that going to be our special guest?

1586
01:28:46,232 --> 01:28:47,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Our big black cock.

1587
01:28:47,613 --> 01:28:50,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, tonight's special guest, my cock.

1588
01:28:50,554 --> 01:28:51,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello.

1589
01:28:51,414 --> 01:28:52,514
[SPEAKER_29]: Is your cock black?

1590
01:28:54,515 --> 01:28:55,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I can get a sharpie.

1591
01:28:59,656 --> 01:29:01,496
[SPEAKER_16]: Rob's going to have little arrows tattooed.

1592
01:29:01,517 --> 01:29:03,297
[SPEAKER_27]: Just dip it in hot fudge or something.

1593
01:29:04,777 --> 01:29:06,198
[SPEAKER_16]: That is a big brown cock.

1594
01:29:07,178 --> 01:29:08,318
[SPEAKER_16]: A very hot cock.

1595
01:29:09,959 --> 01:29:10,659
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, Rob.

1596
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:17,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I like this show reverting to discussions about my cock, but in a way it's kind of cool.

1597
01:29:18,733 --> 01:29:19,854
[SPEAKER_03]: You brought it up, my friend.

1598
01:29:21,394 --> 01:29:22,575
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'm bringing it up right now.

1599
01:29:25,076 --> 01:29:30,738
[SPEAKER_16]: It got all over me.

1600
01:29:32,539 --> 01:29:33,940
[SPEAKER_16]: And Rob was delivered a Sharpie.

1601
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:36,281
[SPEAKER_27]: Put it away.

1602
01:29:37,001 --> 01:29:37,681
[SPEAKER_27]: Put it on.

1603
01:29:37,761 --> 01:29:38,402
[SPEAKER_27]: Put it on.

1604
01:29:39,162 --> 01:29:41,023
[SPEAKER_27]: Whatever you do, keep that thing in your pants.

1605
01:29:47,644 --> 01:29:48,704
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a difference?

1606
01:29:51,305 --> 01:29:57,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see a freestyle routine where somebody just whips their cock out at the end.

1607
01:29:57,506 --> 01:29:58,867
[SPEAKER_03]: What song would that be good to?

1608
01:29:59,967 --> 01:30:00,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Blow My Whistle.

1609
01:30:00,607 --> 01:30:06,489
[SPEAKER_16]: No, we just need to like... No, we need to do a freestyle routine where we throw dildos into the crowd.

1610
01:30:08,409 --> 01:30:10,490
[SPEAKER_16]: Or those penis-shaped chocolates.

1611
01:30:10,510 --> 01:30:10,930
[SPEAKER_16]: That'll be on...

1612
01:30:12,759 --> 01:30:13,782
[SPEAKER_27]: Paranoia or something.

1613
01:30:13,802 --> 01:30:15,045
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just flip your cock out.

1614
01:30:17,652 --> 01:30:20,499
[SPEAKER_03]: When is somebody going to do a routine where they whip their cock out at the end?

1615
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:20,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

1616
01:30:22,441 --> 01:30:25,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised all you comedians out there like to play DDR.

1617
01:30:25,483 --> 01:30:26,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's done it yet.

1618
01:30:26,244 --> 01:30:26,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

1619
01:30:26,884 --> 01:30:29,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Or some women play DDR too.

1620
01:30:29,226 --> 01:30:29,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see some tits.

1621
01:30:30,286 --> 01:30:31,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see a topless DDR routine.

1622
01:30:31,847 --> 01:30:32,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

1623
01:30:33,068 --> 01:30:33,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait.

1624
01:30:34,229 --> 01:30:35,470
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to be good looking.

1625
01:30:37,791 --> 01:30:39,653
[SPEAKER_20]: We must make sure there's no food around either.

1626
01:30:40,433 --> 01:30:45,957
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that enough female freestylers who think they can have a good routine just by grabbing their boobs?

1627
01:30:47,111 --> 01:30:48,091
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, that sucks.

1628
01:30:48,391 --> 01:30:49,252
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not good freestyle.

1629
01:30:49,272 --> 01:30:51,352
[SPEAKER_27]: What are you talking about that's not good freestyle?

1630
01:30:51,953 --> 01:30:53,053
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not good freestyle.

1631
01:30:53,433 --> 01:30:56,414
[SPEAKER_27]: It's called stripping, not freestyle.

1632
01:30:57,234 --> 01:30:59,375
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good Maxim Magazine, bad freestyle.

1633
01:30:59,415 --> 01:31:00,835
[SPEAKER_16]: It's called maybe slut style.

1634
01:31:01,195 --> 01:31:05,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I had a checkmark on all of my, you know, judgy little forms there.

1635
01:31:05,937 --> 01:31:07,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Grab boobs 10, okay?

1636
01:31:08,818 --> 01:31:11,899
[SPEAKER_16]: I had to make a provision when doing the rules for Shaft.

1637
01:31:12,379 --> 01:31:13,119
[SPEAKER_16]: No boob grabbing.

1638
01:31:13,539 --> 01:31:16,060
[SPEAKER_16]: Because that doesn't make a good routine.

1639
01:31:18,308 --> 01:31:22,420
[SPEAKER_16]: It does not make a good... Okay, that's getting into one of my pet peeves of DDR freestyling.

1640
01:31:22,761 --> 01:31:23,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, let's hear it.

1641
01:31:24,045 --> 01:31:25,248
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't grab your boobs!

1642
01:31:26,475 --> 01:31:27,315
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry.

1643
01:31:27,976 --> 01:31:28,916
[SPEAKER_27]: What if I grab my boobs?

1644
01:31:28,936 --> 01:31:29,396
[SPEAKER_27]: Is that okay?

1645
01:31:29,416 --> 01:31:29,816
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, wait, wait.

1646
01:31:30,056 --> 01:31:32,677
[SPEAKER_27]: What if Alan Rickman got on stage and started whipping out his cock?

1647
01:31:33,598 --> 01:31:34,818
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, first of all, he wouldn't.

1648
01:31:35,098 --> 01:31:35,458
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1649
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:37,459
[SPEAKER_16]: But you know what?

1650
01:31:37,579 --> 01:31:43,241
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't see the male freestylers grabbing their dick or anything while they're freestyling.

1651
01:31:43,521 --> 01:31:46,622
[SPEAKER_03]: I will enter a routine and I will grab my dick during the routine.

1652
01:31:46,722 --> 01:31:48,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Will that make you happy if I do my production?

1653
01:31:49,143 --> 01:31:50,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then why do you suggest it?

1654
01:31:51,324 --> 01:31:52,584
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm using it as an example.

1655
01:31:52,605 --> 01:31:52,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1656
01:31:52,985 --> 01:31:53,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1657
01:31:54,145 --> 01:31:55,146
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I'm a crazy bastard.

1658
01:31:55,186 --> 01:31:55,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do it.

1659
01:31:56,427 --> 01:31:59,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't freestyle, so at least I'll get a laugh when I grab my dick, you know?

1660
01:31:59,809 --> 01:32:01,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's a whole new meaning to PA.

1661
01:32:01,450 --> 01:32:02,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Penis attack.

1662
01:32:03,071 --> 01:32:06,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Evan.

1663
01:32:08,795 --> 01:32:10,416
[SPEAKER_26]: Every day with Rob is a penis attack.

1664
01:32:13,078 --> 01:32:14,158
[SPEAKER_18]: I figured out how to make one.

1665
01:32:15,219 --> 01:32:15,519
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, great.

1666
01:32:15,539 --> 01:32:16,880
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a double-ended noose.

1667
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:17,661
[SPEAKER_26]: How kinky.

1668
01:32:17,761 --> 01:32:20,283
[SPEAKER_26]: That's for the goth sex pervert, right?

1669
01:32:22,004 --> 01:32:22,684
[SPEAKER_26]: And it's black.

1670
01:32:22,844 --> 01:32:23,705
[SPEAKER_26]: Does it glow in the dark?

1671
01:32:24,787 --> 01:32:26,028
[SPEAKER_26]: You tell me, it's yours.

1672
01:32:27,329 --> 01:32:28,330
[SPEAKER_26]: You gotta make it all flopsy.

1673
01:32:29,031 --> 01:32:30,072
[SPEAKER_26]: Get your own goddamn mic.

1674
01:32:30,112 --> 01:32:30,873
[SPEAKER_26]: Hold on a second, hold on a second.

1675
01:32:30,893 --> 01:32:31,553
[SPEAKER_26]: Here we go, here we go.

1676
01:32:31,793 --> 01:32:33,175
[SPEAKER_26]: Here's the stupidest thing you can do on radio.

1677
01:32:33,195 --> 01:32:33,955
[SPEAKER_26]: You can do jump rope.

1678
01:32:34,216 --> 01:32:36,838
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, I'm gonna use the mic, and I'm going to make it funny.

1679
01:32:37,298 --> 01:32:37,719
[SPEAKER_26]: Are you ready?

1680
01:32:38,139 --> 01:32:42,463
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, here's a gay man's... Okay, sorry, here's a lesbian's nightmare.

1681
01:32:46,667 --> 01:32:48,108
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, here's a gay man's nightmare.

1682
01:32:52,912 --> 01:32:53,812
[SPEAKER_26]: There you go.

1683
01:32:53,852 --> 01:32:56,313
[SPEAKER_26]: Nobody in the audience.

1684
01:32:56,673 --> 01:32:57,894
[SPEAKER_26]: That was very intentional.

1685
01:32:58,194 --> 01:32:59,534
[SPEAKER_26]: Now Rob tried to describe that.

1686
01:33:01,415 --> 01:33:02,855
[SPEAKER_28]: I had a question for you, Evan.

1687
01:33:03,635 --> 01:33:03,915
[SPEAKER_28]: Evan?

1688
01:33:04,976 --> 01:33:08,337
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, why do you think nobody's whipped their cock out at the end of a DDR routine yet?

1689
01:33:10,075 --> 01:33:13,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we haven't seen the private DDR routines that Brad and Irene have.

1690
01:33:15,557 --> 01:33:17,918
[SPEAKER_26]: Late at night.

1691
01:33:18,638 --> 01:33:19,119
[SPEAKER_26]: And you know what?

1692
01:33:19,159 --> 01:33:19,699
[SPEAKER_26]: Hold on a second.

1693
01:33:19,719 --> 01:33:22,480
[SPEAKER_26]: Before Brad says anything, I do want to make this parting comment.

1694
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:26,401
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, although I haven't seen it, I have heard that Irene's cock is quite nice.

1695
01:33:28,462 --> 01:33:29,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh boy.

1696
01:33:34,864 --> 01:33:36,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1697
01:33:37,426 --> 01:33:40,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're going to take a quick break at this point.

1698
01:33:41,669 --> 01:33:43,030
[SPEAKER_28]: As Brad goes to break.

1699
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:45,232
[SPEAKER_03]: We've reached our cock quotient of the show.

1700
01:33:45,252 --> 01:33:46,873
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to come back.

1701
01:33:46,893 --> 01:33:47,493
[SPEAKER_16]: Use the ferret.

1702
01:33:48,074 --> 01:33:50,916
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to play the match game live in studio.

1703
01:33:50,936 --> 01:33:51,956
[SPEAKER_16]: We can do list list.

1704
01:33:51,976 --> 01:33:53,057
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to do list list first?

1705
01:33:53,117 --> 01:33:53,457
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1706
01:33:54,238 --> 01:33:55,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's list them match game.

1707
01:33:55,599 --> 01:33:56,460
[SPEAKER_03]: We always do match game.

1708
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:57,741
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to do the cage match some way too.

1709
01:33:57,761 --> 01:33:58,701
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we have to do cage match.

1710
01:33:58,721 --> 01:33:59,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do the cage match now.

1711
01:34:00,022 --> 01:34:00,282
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1712
01:34:00,483 --> 01:34:01,123
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, fuck the break.

1713
01:34:01,143 --> 01:34:01,743
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do the cage match.

1714
01:34:02,064 --> 01:34:02,644
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, here we go.

1715
01:34:02,664 --> 01:34:03,425
[SPEAKER_28]: Woohoo!

1716
01:34:06,003 --> 01:34:10,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we are going to talk about two weeks ago.

1717
01:34:10,407 --> 01:34:12,449
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't do a cage match last week, correct?

1718
01:34:12,709 --> 01:34:13,890
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I didn't.

1719
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:27,941
[SPEAKER_03]: So, last week, two weeks ago, in the Orange Lounge cage match, where we pit songs against each other because we like to, we had Ayumi Hamasaki win with Connected in a very, very, very close vote.

1720
01:34:27,981 --> 01:34:30,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it came down to a game of rock, paper, scissors.

1721
01:34:30,143 --> 01:34:33,086
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck all of you for not voting for Knight Rider, bitches.

1722
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:36,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Knight Rider was the shit, but unfortunately it lost.

1723
01:34:36,067 --> 01:34:37,788
[SPEAKER_03]: And fuck me for being bad at rock, paper, scissors.

1724
01:34:39,890 --> 01:34:40,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1725
01:34:41,452 --> 01:34:49,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so the first song, you're able to vote for one of three songs in the cage match.

1726
01:34:49,579 --> 01:34:51,281
[SPEAKER_03]: You can vote for last week's winner.

1727
01:34:53,082 --> 01:34:53,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm English today.

1728
01:34:54,083 --> 01:34:56,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's last week's winner, or two weeks ago's winner.

1729
01:34:56,766 --> 01:34:58,447
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Ayumi Hamasaki with Connected.

1730
01:34:58,467 --> 01:34:59,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a little clip.

1731
01:35:21,992 --> 01:35:23,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's the Yumi Hamasaki with Connected.

1732
01:35:23,893 --> 01:35:25,093
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the first one you can vote for.

1733
01:35:25,113 --> 01:35:25,934
[SPEAKER_03]: That's last week's winner.

1734
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:31,736
[SPEAKER_03]: This first pick in the cage match, this is a group called Bond with a song called Fuego.

1735
01:35:31,777 --> 01:35:33,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, do you want to enter this and introduce this for us?

1736
01:35:34,798 --> 01:35:36,399
[SPEAKER_16]: It's short, cool, and fuego.

1737
01:35:36,739 --> 01:35:37,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here it is.

1738
01:35:37,399 --> 01:35:39,420
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first song in the cage match you can vote for this week.

1739
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:42,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Second song, I'm sorry, you can vote for Yumi Hamasaki or you can vote for this.

1740
01:35:42,301 --> 01:35:43,582
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Bond with Fuego.

1741
01:35:48,144 --> 01:35:48,966
Thanks for watching!

1742
01:36:42,443 --> 01:36:42,977
Thanks for watching!

1743
01:38:27,058 --> 01:38:27,158
Okay.

1744
01:38:27,318 --> 01:38:28,539
I love that song.

1745
01:38:28,599 --> 01:38:29,800
Anything with the name Fuego.

1746
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:31,161
Because I like fire.

1747
01:38:50,854 --> 01:38:52,375
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a pretty neat song.

1748
01:38:52,435 --> 01:38:53,416
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you all think of that?

1749
01:38:53,436 --> 01:38:54,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around the room.

1750
01:38:54,597 --> 01:38:56,459
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think of it and judge it on a scale of 1 to 10?

1751
01:38:56,619 --> 01:38:57,300
[SPEAKER_16]: It's awesome, 10.

1752
01:38:58,561 --> 01:39:00,703
[SPEAKER_27]: I think Fuego tastes pretty good, that soda.

1753
01:39:01,303 --> 01:39:01,904
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, Fuego.

1754
01:39:02,164 --> 01:39:03,265
[SPEAKER_27]: That is a really cool song.

1755
01:39:03,345 --> 01:39:04,987
[SPEAKER_27]: Somebody should make steps for that for DDR.

1756
01:39:05,787 --> 01:39:06,148
[SPEAKER_27]: Loki?

1757
01:39:06,848 --> 01:39:07,449
[SPEAKER_26]: Don't look at me.

1758
01:39:07,469 --> 01:39:08,730
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not going to friggin' make that.

1759
01:39:09,611 --> 01:39:12,193
[SPEAKER_08]: I give it an 8 because it just sounds like Vanessa May.

1760
01:39:14,355 --> 01:39:14,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll do it.

1761
01:39:14,835 --> 01:39:14,815
7.

1762
01:39:14,855 --> 01:39:15,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

1763
01:39:17,382 --> 01:39:17,883
[SPEAKER_20]: Angel says,

1764
01:39:31,765 --> 01:39:34,187
[SPEAKER_18]: 9.5!

1765
01:39:33,226 --> 01:39:34,187
[SPEAKER_20]: She says 5 instead.

1766
01:39:35,228 --> 01:39:38,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree, it's Vanessa made the sequel, but it's still pretty cool, so I give it a 9.

1767
01:39:39,031 --> 01:39:42,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on, the next song, Loki, tell us about this one.

1768
01:39:42,894 --> 01:39:44,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're only going to play part of this song, correct?

1769
01:39:45,035 --> 01:39:46,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because it's like an 8 minute long song.

1770
01:39:46,516 --> 01:39:49,359
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to play a few minutes of it, so tell us about this song.

1771
01:39:49,419 --> 01:39:53,682
[SPEAKER_08]: This song was entered in Tourney Mix 3, the cut down version of it was.

1772
01:39:54,302 --> 01:39:59,925
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an mp3.com artist, which should be going mainstream, I hope, soon.

1773
01:40:00,425 --> 01:40:02,687
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Airbase with their song Spin.

1774
01:40:02,787 --> 01:40:05,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, and after this is over, you can vote for this one if you want.

1775
01:40:05,788 --> 01:40:07,189
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Airbase with Spin.

1776
01:40:43,213 --> 01:40:44,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1777
01:43:39,764 --> 01:43:41,248
Thank you for watching!

1778
01:44:36,474 --> 01:44:37,535
Thanks for watching!

1779
01:45:54,891 --> 01:45:58,194
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that was Airbase with a song called Spin.

1780
01:45:58,214 --> 01:45:59,255
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't even the whole thing.

1781
01:46:00,256 --> 01:46:02,538
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's the end of the cage match.

1782
01:46:02,558 --> 01:46:03,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I live for Holic.

1783
01:46:03,458 --> 01:46:04,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Three songs.

1784
01:46:04,479 --> 01:46:10,124
[SPEAKER_03]: You have Yumi Hamasaki, last week's winner with Connected, Bond with Fuego, and Airbase with Spin.

1785
01:46:10,664 --> 01:46:11,985
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys can vote now.

1786
01:46:12,065 --> 01:46:14,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Send your votes over private message to Sky.

1787
01:46:15,048 --> 01:46:17,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And while you send your votes, let's hear the verdicts on Airbase.

1788
01:46:17,690 --> 01:46:17,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob?

1789
01:46:18,190 --> 01:46:18,391
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1790
01:46:18,551 --> 01:46:18,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob?

1791
01:46:19,011 --> 01:46:19,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?

1792
01:46:19,351 --> 01:46:19,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

1793
01:46:19,672 --> 01:46:19,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

1794
01:46:20,652 --> 01:46:22,314
[SPEAKER_16]: It was repetitive.

1795
01:46:22,874 --> 01:46:23,755
[SPEAKER_03]: He's always repetitive.

1796
01:46:23,955 --> 01:46:24,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Scale of 1 to 10.

1797
01:46:24,976 --> 01:46:30,041
[SPEAKER_16]: I would probably play that in the background while I'm working on banners and stuff and doing my artwork.

1798
01:46:30,521 --> 01:46:31,182
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd give it a 7.5.

1799
01:46:31,222 --> 01:46:31,182
7.5.

1800
01:46:31,302 --> 01:46:31,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1801
01:46:31,582 --> 01:46:32,363
[SPEAKER_16]: It's more dancey stuff.

1802
01:46:37,537 --> 01:46:45,299
[SPEAKER_26]: and there's nothing wrong with dancey stuff, it's supposed to be long because it's a 12 inch mix so you can mix it into other shit, but anyways, SHUT UP!

1803
01:46:48,000 --> 01:47:01,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, um, I like it, it was one of my favorite entries in Attorney Mix 3, I wish I could have had a chance to cut it down so that it'd be less repetitive, but anyways, um, I give it a 10.

1804
01:47:02,564 --> 01:47:02,905
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1805
01:47:03,125 --> 01:47:04,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad, what did you think of Airbase's spin?

1806
01:47:05,208 --> 01:47:06,991
[SPEAKER_27]: Cool, but they should have DDR-sized it.

1807
01:47:07,011 --> 01:47:07,572
[SPEAKER_27]: It would have been great.

1808
01:47:08,754 --> 01:47:11,659
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'd give it a 7 as it is.

1809
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:12,540
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1810
01:47:14,002 --> 01:47:15,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave, what you heard of it?

1811
01:47:16,540 --> 01:47:17,081
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, hi.

1812
01:47:17,361 --> 01:47:18,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, hi.

1813
01:47:18,782 --> 01:47:27,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I just kind of came in and took pictures, but I guess I was kind of listening, so I give it a seven and a half.

1814
01:47:27,589 --> 01:47:28,349
[SPEAKER_04]: You're full of shit.

1815
01:47:28,709 --> 01:47:29,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Magus.

1816
01:47:30,451 --> 01:47:30,791
[SPEAKER_20]: Late.

1817
01:47:31,051 --> 01:47:31,432
[SPEAKER_20]: Ten.

[SPEAKER_20]: Out.

1820
01:47:33,013 --> 01:47:33,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Stressa.

1821
01:47:33,933 --> 01:47:34,974
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, that was easily said.

1822
01:47:35,455 --> 01:47:38,537
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, I actually am quite fond of this track, I think.

1823
01:47:39,617 --> 01:47:40,458
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow, such spirit.

1824
01:47:41,258 --> 01:47:41,879
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to give that an 8.

1825
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:44,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1826
01:47:44,901 --> 01:47:45,541
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm tied.

1827
01:47:46,061 --> 01:47:46,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel, what do you think?

1828
01:47:47,002 --> 01:47:48,043
[SPEAKER_18]: I said I'm tied.

1829
01:47:48,263 --> 01:47:54,707
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of a bow thing.

1830
01:47:56,469 --> 01:47:57,609
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll give it an 8, sorry.

1831
01:47:57,970 --> 01:47:58,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, an 8.

1832
01:48:00,291 --> 01:48:05,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it, it was cool, except I didn't like that wee, wee, wee part, and Bond was better.

1833
01:48:05,275 --> 01:48:08,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuego was better, so I can't rank it higher than that, so I'll give it an 8.

1834
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:12,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so the votes are coming in right now.

1835
01:48:13,101 --> 01:48:15,502

01:48:21,484 --> 01:48:26,845
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can vote for Ayumi, you can vote for Bond with Fuego, or you can vote for Airbase.

1839
01:48:27,986 --> 01:48:29,346
[SPEAKER_17]: Rob's good at typing with one hand.

1840
01:48:30,006 --> 01:48:30,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm typing with one hand.

1841
01:48:30,827 --> 01:48:32,667

1847
01:48:48,701 --> 01:48:51,863
[SPEAKER_03]: However, we have so many people in studio tonight, we're going to have live contestants.

1848
01:48:52,324 --> 01:48:54,385
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can get live reactions and everything like that.

1849
01:48:54,785 --> 01:48:58,868
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you guys want to play along in the chatroom, you can send us your suggestions.

1850
01:48:58,888 --> 01:48:59,488
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great.

1851
01:49:00,009 --> 01:49:02,911
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the meantime, our contestants for tonight will be our out-of-town visitors.

[SPEAKER_03]: A ride home.

01:49:14,378 --> 01:49:15,138
[SPEAKER_03]: A big black cock.

1859
01:49:15,538 --> 01:49:18,720
[SPEAKER_03]: A big black cock is what you're playing for tonight.

1897
01:50:47,939 --> 01:50:54,402

1933
01:52:49,822 --> 01:52:51,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Dressa, you're first, because you're pointing at the other person.

1934
01:52:52,958 --> 01:52:54,058
[SPEAKER_20]: I love that, volunteering.

1935
01:52:54,459 --> 01:53:03,522
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, I would like to think that the manager said, Dammit, Sammy, you've got animal cookie heads all over the dance pad.

1946
01:53:23,317 --> 01:53:24,578
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not a match.

[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, very good.

1953
01:53:38,140 --> 01:53:40,362
[SPEAKER_03]: You matched with someone in the chat room, but not close enough.

1954
01:53:40,922 --> 01:53:41,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave.

1955

[SPEAKER_16]: No, it was Spanish Haggis, I'm sorry.

1971
01:54:05,936 --> 01:54:07,877
[SPEAKER_16]: I took a line wrong about it.

1972
01:54:08,637 --> 01:54:11,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Magus, dammit Sammy, you got... Propel.

1973
01:54:11,938 --> 01:54:13,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Propel all over the dance pad.

1974
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:17,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, very close.

1975
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:19,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1976
01:54:20,401 --> 01:54:29,904
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, you know, because thinking that Sammy the Snacker is going to be really excited to be playing DDR and eating at the same time, I said, dammit Sammy, you got jizz all over the dance pad.

1977
01:54:31,411 --> 01:54:32,952
[SPEAKER_16]: Damn it, I was gonna say that!

1978
01:54:33,433 --> 01:54:35,455
[SPEAKER_16]: We do not have a match.

1979
01:54:35,495 --> 01:54:37,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is half a match with salty nuts.

1980
01:54:39,218 --> 01:54:40,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1981
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:40,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

[SPEAKER_03]: Isolation boost.

1983
01:54:42,842 --> 01:54:45,404
[SPEAKER_16]: Isolation boost.

1984
01:54:45,584 --> 01:54:48,026
[SPEAKER_16]: It sort of went with pussy because I was thinking Sammy might be a girl.

1985
01:54:50,028 --> 01:54:53,732
[SPEAKER_16]: Or unless, you know, Sammy just happened to be, you know, snacking away.

1986
01:54:53,832 --> 01:54:54,092
[SPEAKER_16]: Rob?

1988
01:54:55,533 --> 01:54:57,055
[SPEAKER_18]: Irene would like to say Matt, he's an eaglet.

01:54:58,163 --> 01:54:59,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Maddie's in the igloo, thank you.

1990
01:55:00,124 --> 01:55:01,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Go whack her with a bug net.

1991
01:55:01,824 --> 01:55:02,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell her to try to get the dummy.

1992
01:55:03,145 --> 01:55:04,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, isolation boost, isolation boost.

1993
01:55:04,545 --> 01:55:05,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here we go.

1994
01:55:06,266 --> 01:55:07,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Next question, here we go.

1995
01:55:08,627 --> 01:55:10,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Scores all tied up, zero apiece.

1996

[SPEAKER_03]: Ralphie the Raver... Are they gone?

1997
01:55:14,189 --> 01:55:15,169

2005
01:55:57,031 --> 01:55:59,532

01:58:28,721 --> 01:58:31,422

2076
01:59:18,256 --> 01:59:20,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is cock in such a big font?

2077
01:59:20,878 --> 01:59:22,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I like cock.

2078
01:59:22,498 --> 01:59:26,680
[SPEAKER_16]: I think because there was so much mention of cock that was matched up with each of them to get a half point.

2079
01:59:26,780 --> 01:59:27,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Each of them gets a half point?

2080
01:59:27,881 --> 01:59:28,221

[SPEAKER_26]: Did you write it down?

2125
02:01:15,334 --> 02:01:17,335
[SPEAKER_26]: End of the rules.

2126
02:01:17,355 --> 02:01:18,156
[SPEAKER_26]: Who's actually matching?

2127
02:01:19,816 --> 02:01:23,958
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, sure.

2128
02:01:24,759 --> 02:01:25,299
[SPEAKER_26]: Rob's cock.

2129
02:01:26,440 --> 02:01:28,381
[SPEAKER_26]: Without a picture of Rob's cock.

2130
02:01:28,521 --> 02:01:33,783
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, ladies and gentlemen, you need one of those little tiny microscopic lenses.

2131
02:01:35,464 --> 02:01:35,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha.

2132
02:01:36,325 --> 02:01:37,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the victims.

2133
02:01:37,305 --> 02:01:38,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here come the victims.

2134
02:01:39,626 --> 02:01:40,947
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Ray, I am Ray Burry.

2135
02:01:43,433 --> 02:01:49,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Carry the Camera Whore loves to take pictures at DDR tournaments, but her collection of tourney pics is never complete without a picture of... Upskirt Shots.

2136
02:01:49,758 --> 02:01:50,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Upskirt Shots!

2137
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:51,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.

2138
02:02:12,649 --> 02:02:26,983
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like panty shots, you must go out and get the anime, uh, what is it, it's, uh, VR, uh, the, the, Nightsaber, no, it's, uh, Go Kaiser?

2139
02:02:27,323 --> 02:02:28,465
[SPEAKER_26]: No, no, no, no, no.

2140
02:02:28,505 --> 02:02:29,005
[SPEAKER_26]: VR 40 Fresh.

2141
02:02:29,245 --> 02:02:30,066
[SPEAKER_26]: VR 40 Fresh!

2142
02:02:30,106 --> 02:02:33,529
[SPEAKER_26]: You must get VR 40 Fresh, because every other shot is a panty shot.

2143
02:02:34,210 --> 02:02:34,610
[SPEAKER_26]: Upskirt.

2144
02:02:34,811 --> 02:02:36,973
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, it's amazing how many times I have to crawl through tunnels in that.

2145
02:02:40,330 --> 02:02:41,050
[SPEAKER_18]: How dare you?

2146
02:02:41,110 --> 02:02:42,691
[SPEAKER_18]: You made me forget the question.

2147
02:02:43,151 --> 02:02:44,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll read it to you again.

2148
02:02:45,051 --> 02:02:54,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Carrie the Camera Whore loves to take pictures at DDR tournaments, but her collection of tourney pics is never complete without a picture of... I have to say upskirt shots.

2149
02:02:54,653 --> 02:02:55,113
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.

2150
02:02:55,493 --> 02:02:56,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Upskirt shot.

2151
02:02:56,053 --> 02:02:57,414
[SPEAKER_03]: They're both saying upskirt shot.

2152
02:02:58,314 --> 02:03:00,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Does genitalia count as an upskirt shot?

2153
02:03:00,394 --> 02:03:01,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, like, I'm close.

2154
02:03:02,835 --> 02:03:03,135
[SPEAKER_18]: Why?

2155
02:03:03,175 --> 02:03:07,596
[SPEAKER_18]: Because you made me think that way, and that's the first thing I thought of.

2156
02:03:08,857 --> 02:03:09,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure it was.

2157
02:03:09,718 --> 02:03:11,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here we go.

2158
02:03:11,519 --> 02:03:13,220
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rob, I'm sure you've worn a skirt before.

2159
02:03:14,641 --> 02:03:15,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, what's up?

2160
02:03:17,783 --> 02:03:18,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Get out!

2161
02:03:19,164 --> 02:03:20,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here we go.

2162
02:03:21,765 --> 02:03:22,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting with Jamie.

2163
02:03:23,947 --> 02:03:31,392
[SPEAKER_26]: Jamie, that camera... Actually, she's always on the cover of National Geographic.

2164
02:03:32,312 --> 02:03:36,515
[SPEAKER_26]: She's the one washing her clothes in the river, you know, topless.

2165
02:03:38,004 --> 02:03:39,424
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to give my answer.

2166
02:03:40,685 --> 02:03:41,645
[SPEAKER_26]: And your sister's there, too.

2167
02:03:41,905 --> 02:03:44,246
[SPEAKER_26]: But she's in those cute pictures, like, with the two leopards.

2168
02:03:46,867 --> 02:03:47,307
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyway.

2169
02:03:48,267 --> 02:03:49,107
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Evan.

2170
02:03:49,127 --> 02:03:50,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie.

2171
02:03:51,068 --> 02:03:56,510
[SPEAKER_16]: No, picture collection is not complete without a picture of... A picture of herself that's used on the teen masturbation site.

2172
02:03:56,570 --> 02:03:57,650
[SPEAKER_16]: Damn it, how did that get there?

2173
02:04:00,811 --> 02:04:01,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.

2174
02:04:03,052 --> 02:04:04,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, but not a match, sorry.

2175
02:04:04,452 --> 02:04:06,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Her collection of tourney pics is never complete without a picture of...

2176
02:04:08,309 --> 02:04:11,910
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have to modify what... It's pretty much what my answer was going to be.

2177
02:04:12,550 --> 02:04:17,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of her big black cock, it's going to be her big black cock.

2178
02:04:17,991 --> 02:04:19,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Her big black cock.

2179
02:04:19,631 --> 02:04:20,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, not a match.

2180
02:04:20,711 --> 02:04:26,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave, her collection of tourney pics is never complete without a picture of... Two girls humping the secret rendezvous.

2181
02:04:27,233 --> 02:04:30,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Two girls... Two girls humping the secret rendezvous.

2182
02:04:31,013 --> 02:04:31,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.

2183
02:04:33,434 --> 02:04:33,914
[SPEAKER_03]: But not a match.

2184
02:04:35,851 --> 02:04:37,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God that didn't go out on error.

2185
02:04:38,112 --> 02:04:39,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you want a mic to say that again.

2186
02:04:41,574 --> 02:04:45,076
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank God I wasn't given mental imagery of... Okay, it happened.

2187
02:04:49,219 --> 02:04:49,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad.

2188
02:04:50,379 --> 02:04:54,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Her collection of tourney pics was never complete without a picture of... Fiona showing off her ass.

2189
02:04:57,742 --> 02:05:00,745
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Brad, for saying everything we were thinking.

2190
02:05:01,966 --> 02:05:05,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Her collection of Journey pics is never complete without a picture of Fiona showing off her ass.

2191
02:05:06,149 --> 02:05:07,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Good answer, however, it's not a match.

2192
02:05:09,172 --> 02:05:10,613
[SPEAKER_03]: My answer, did I get everybody else?

2193
02:05:11,034 --> 02:05:11,694
No.

2194
02:05:11,854 --> 02:05:12,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry, Magus.

2195
02:05:12,435 --> 02:05:13,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he's hiding behind me.

2196
02:05:14,056 --> 02:05:15,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how's that match?

2197
02:05:15,878 --> 02:05:18,981
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time I saw Fiona, she was showing her ass off through her skirt.

2198
02:05:20,308 --> 02:05:21,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a point!

2199
02:05:21,129 --> 02:05:22,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, they get a point each.

2200
02:05:22,449 --> 02:05:22,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2201
02:05:23,710 --> 02:05:24,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2202
02:05:25,171 --> 02:05:27,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a point and a half each.

2203
02:05:28,513 --> 02:05:33,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Magus, his collection of tourney pics is never complete without a picture of... A big black cock.

2204
02:05:33,396 --> 02:05:34,536
[SPEAKER_03]: A big black cock!

2205
02:05:35,217 --> 02:05:35,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a match, sorry.

2206
02:05:37,999 --> 02:05:40,060
[SPEAKER_27]: Is there penis envy going on today or what?

2207
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:43,922
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all a tribute show to Ruben.

2208
02:05:44,202 --> 02:05:46,423
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's just... It's all a tribute show to Ruben.

2209
02:05:46,604 --> 02:05:48,645
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just big black cock day, didn't get the memo?

2210
02:05:50,763 --> 02:05:52,925
[SPEAKER_16]: I like saying big black cock.

2211
02:05:54,846 --> 02:06:00,949
[SPEAKER_16]: Is she a sweet transvestite?

2212
02:06:00,969 --> 02:06:06,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving along, her collection of tourney pics is never complete without a picture of Asian penis.

2213
02:06:09,815 --> 02:06:11,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I put Asian penis, but not a match.

2214
02:06:11,276 --> 02:06:12,717
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it's not a big black cock, but...

2215
02:06:15,054 --> 02:06:17,297
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make that joke yourself.

2216
02:06:32,578 --> 02:06:35,802
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're going to come back and I think we're going to try a listless next.

2217
02:06:36,342 --> 02:06:36,562
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2218
02:06:36,602 --> 02:06:37,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember right into a listless?

2219
02:06:38,184 --> 02:06:39,546
[SPEAKER_18]: You need to remind you we are tied.

2220
02:06:39,906 --> 02:06:40,467
[SPEAKER_18]: And don't forget.

2221
02:06:40,487 --> 02:06:40,907
[SPEAKER_03]: They're tied.

2222
02:06:40,947 --> 02:06:41,328
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

2223
02:06:41,548 --> 02:06:42,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we do a tiebreaker round?

2224
02:06:42,850 --> 02:06:44,171
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I keep thinking the thing.

2225
02:06:44,351 --> 02:06:45,392
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do a tiebreaker round.

2226
02:06:45,553 --> 02:06:45,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Out.

2227
02:06:49,508 --> 02:06:55,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie's taking over as host because, unfortunately, my hosting skills got them a tie.

2228
02:06:55,851 --> 02:06:59,752
[SPEAKER_11]: I have Big Black Cock.

2229
02:07:03,234 --> 02:07:04,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Jamie's coming up with a question right now.

2230
02:07:06,015 --> 02:07:13,998
[SPEAKER_16]: The staff of Orange Lounge most likes to talk about... Okay, the staff of Orange Lounge most likes to talk about blank.

2231
02:07:14,038 --> 02:07:14,718
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the tiebreaker?

2232
02:07:14,738 --> 02:07:14,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2233
02:07:15,058 --> 02:07:15,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here we go.

2234
02:07:16,159 --> 02:07:19,140
[SPEAKER_03]: The staff of Orange Lounge most likes to talk about blank.

2235
02:07:32,191 --> 02:07:32,591
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2236
02:07:33,172 --> 02:07:34,192
[SPEAKER_15]: Bring him in, bring him in.

2237
02:07:34,212 --> 02:07:34,852
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, everybody in?

2238
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:35,432
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here we go.

2239
02:07:36,513 --> 02:07:39,294
[SPEAKER_03]: The staff of Orange Lounge most likes to talk about blank.

2240
02:07:39,374 --> 02:07:39,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

2241
02:07:41,394 --> 02:07:42,735
[SPEAKER_16]: Burp, burp, burp.

2242
02:07:47,595 --> 02:07:47,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2243
02:07:48,015 --> 02:07:48,775
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll take a break at some point.

2244
02:07:48,795 --> 02:07:49,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the question.

2245
02:07:50,196 --> 02:07:50,556
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on?

2246
02:07:50,916 --> 02:07:53,797
[SPEAKER_16]: The staff of Orange Lounge... Are you ready?

2247
02:07:54,317 --> 02:07:57,218
[SPEAKER_16]: The staff of Orange Lounge most likes to talk about blank.

2248
02:07:57,978 --> 02:07:58,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, here it is.

2249
02:07:59,198 --> 02:08:00,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel, your first this time.

2250
02:08:00,158 --> 02:08:07,020
[SPEAKER_18]: The staff of Orange Lounge most likes to talk about... And $50 goes to... Big Black Cock!

2251
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:09,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Big Black Cock, says Angel.

2252
02:08:09,861 --> 02:08:10,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Good answer.

2253
02:08:10,541 --> 02:08:13,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Stressa, the staff of Orange Lounge most likes to talk about...

2254
02:08:14,878 --> 02:08:19,702
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, considering the current flow of conversation... Don't say the same thing.

2255
02:08:19,742 --> 02:08:21,183
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not how you break a tie.

2256
02:08:25,867 --> 02:08:26,587
[SPEAKER_20]: That's true.

2257
02:08:27,768 --> 02:08:28,929
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, it might be trick.

2258
02:08:30,230 --> 02:08:35,654
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to be out there in left field, and since I don't have much else on my head at this minute, propel.

2259
02:08:36,155 --> 02:08:37,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Propel.

2260
02:08:37,216 --> 02:08:37,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

2261
02:08:37,796 --> 02:08:39,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we have Big Black Cock and we have Propel.

2262
02:08:40,218 --> 02:08:44,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, the staff of Orange Lounge most likes to talk about...

2263
02:08:44,727 --> 02:08:45,548
[SPEAKER_16]: Big Black Cock!

2264
02:08:45,648 --> 02:08:46,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Big Black Cock!

2265
02:08:46,909 --> 02:08:48,611
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a match, alright, good job.

2266
02:08:49,211 --> 02:08:49,591
[SPEAKER_03]: One match.

2267
02:08:51,733 --> 02:08:52,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel is leading.

2268
02:08:52,914 --> 02:08:55,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Bomani, you freaking sicko freaks!

2269
02:08:55,477 --> 02:08:57,519
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think this show's about?

2270
02:08:57,799 --> 02:08:58,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Bomani.

2271
02:08:59,340 --> 02:09:01,422
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not a match, and a vicious lie.

2272
02:09:01,802 --> 02:09:02,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave!

2273
02:09:04,079 --> 02:09:07,443
[SPEAKER_03]: They most like to talk about my big black cock.

2274
02:09:07,503 --> 02:09:07,883
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2275
02:09:09,625 --> 02:09:10,446
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a half point.

2276
02:09:10,806 --> 02:09:12,728
[SPEAKER_03]: So Angel gets another half point.

2277
02:09:12,748 --> 02:09:14,030
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's a full point, baby.

2278
02:09:14,090 --> 02:09:16,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, a full point.

2279
02:09:16,412 --> 02:09:17,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel leads by two.

2280
02:09:17,594 --> 02:09:19,636
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a full foot long of points.

2281
02:09:20,096 --> 02:09:20,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2282
02:09:20,717 --> 02:09:23,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad, most likes to talk about dead babies.

2283
02:09:28,379 --> 02:09:31,680
[SPEAKER_02]: That didn't get picked up on the mic in that sound.

2284
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Skinny white cunt!

2285
02:09:34,361 --> 02:09:35,621
[SPEAKER_27]: Skinny white cunt.

2286
02:09:36,542 --> 02:09:37,422
[SPEAKER_29]: What did you call me?

2287
02:09:39,243 --> 02:09:40,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Skinny white cunt!

2288
02:09:41,983 --> 02:09:42,924
[SPEAKER_29]: I thought so.

2289
02:09:47,885 --> 02:09:48,085
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh!

2290
02:09:48,465 --> 02:09:49,746
[SPEAKER_27]: Wait, Fiona's not white.

2291
02:09:52,719 --> 02:09:54,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, was that my outer monologue?

2292
02:09:54,600 --> 02:09:55,761
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that was my inner voice.

2293
02:09:55,781 --> 02:09:57,162
[SPEAKER_20]: Is this white or pink?

2294
02:09:57,402 --> 02:09:59,143
[SPEAKER_20]: Is this... This whole weekend?

2295
02:10:00,004 --> 02:10:01,084
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait, wait, excuse me.

2296
02:10:01,605 --> 02:10:04,807
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody saw this, but I just got hit by the door three times.

2297
02:10:05,127 --> 02:10:06,788
[SPEAKER_18]: My ass got hit by the door three times.

2298
02:10:06,848 --> 02:10:07,288
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2299
02:10:07,628 --> 02:10:08,509
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, quick question.

2300
02:10:08,649 --> 02:10:09,369
[SPEAKER_20]: FU goes to the door.

2301
02:10:10,450 --> 02:10:10,990
[SPEAKER_20]: Quick question.

2302
02:10:11,971 --> 02:10:14,573
[SPEAKER_26]: Female Asians with big breasts, man-made or myth?

2303
02:10:17,254 --> 02:10:19,656
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we should go on to our next answer.

2304
02:10:20,748 --> 02:10:23,029
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh yeah, mine was Dead Babies, because nobody probably heard that.

2305
02:10:24,310 --> 02:10:25,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Or we forgot, I don't know.

2306
02:10:25,411 --> 02:10:28,132
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to go for the obligatory, Propel!

2307
02:10:28,533 --> 02:10:28,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes!

2308
02:10:31,715 --> 02:10:36,057
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you are up by one point, so if I said Propel, we go to another tiebreaker round.

2309
02:10:37,018 --> 02:10:38,599
[SPEAKER_03]: If I said Big Black Cock...

2310
02:10:39,784 --> 02:10:40,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel's going to win by a lead.

2311
02:10:40,905 --> 02:10:42,166
[SPEAKER_19]: Angel gets a big black card.

2312
02:10:42,186 --> 02:10:47,690
[SPEAKER_03]: My answer was, on Orange Lounge, we talk about Ted DDR.

2313
02:10:50,592 --> 02:10:51,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel wins.

2314
02:10:51,693 --> 02:10:54,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel, go get a handful of Jamie's Big Nuts.

2315
02:10:55,736 --> 02:10:56,516
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your prize.

2316
02:10:56,977 --> 02:10:57,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get your hand in there.

2317
02:10:57,797 --> 02:11:00,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, scoop them all up.

2318
02:11:00,159 --> 02:11:00,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Now lick them.

2319
02:11:00,699 --> 02:11:01,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it in your mouth.

2320
02:11:02,621 --> 02:11:03,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it, bitch.

2321
02:11:07,370 --> 02:11:08,591
[SPEAKER_16]: You know you want to suck the nuts.

2322
02:11:08,611 --> 02:11:10,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Here they go, come on, come on, come on, go, go.

2323
02:11:12,452 --> 02:11:13,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, she's gagging.

2324
02:11:16,394 --> 02:11:17,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Too hot for her to handle.

2325
02:11:20,076 --> 02:11:21,537
[SPEAKER_05]: She's got a mouth full of nuts.

2326
02:11:21,737 --> 02:11:22,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2327
02:11:22,877 --> 02:11:23,978
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, that's it.

2328
02:11:24,038 --> 02:11:26,199
[SPEAKER_08]: And once again, my nuts are safe for consumption.

2329
02:11:26,219 --> 02:11:26,659
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go.

2330
02:11:29,284 --> 02:11:34,928
[SPEAKER_26]: And with that, I think that we have a very appropriate song here to be playing.

2331
02:11:35,649 --> 02:11:37,770
[SPEAKER_26]: It's going to be called Cramming for College.

2332
02:11:38,350 --> 02:11:42,173
[SPEAKER_26]: So, do enjoy.

2333
02:11:43,854 --> 02:11:44,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, enjoy.

2334
02:11:44,495 --> 02:11:47,196
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our next break music because Loki wants to hear it.

2335
02:11:47,236 --> 02:11:48,397
[SPEAKER_03]: This is called Cramming for College.

2336
02:11:48,738 --> 02:11:48,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?

2337
02:11:49,418 --> 02:11:51,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Public announcement, I think I just pissed myself.

2338
02:11:52,280 --> 02:11:52,600
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2339
02:11:53,561 --> 02:11:54,221
[SPEAKER_03]: You smell funny.

2340
02:11:56,164 --> 02:11:57,785
[SPEAKER_16]: I was just scared I sold my armor.

2341
02:11:58,165 --> 02:11:58,645
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2342
02:11:58,785 --> 02:11:59,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you enjoyed the match game.

2343
02:11:59,825 --> 02:12:00,325
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be right back.

2344
02:12:00,345 --> 02:12:03,907
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to send us an email, orangelauncheradio.yahoo.com if you have more questions for us.

2345
02:12:03,947 --> 02:12:05,407
[SPEAKER_16]: In the meantime, we have to tabulate the votes.

2346
02:12:05,447 --> 02:12:07,148
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, we've got to tabulate the votes.

2347
02:12:07,248 --> 02:12:10,829
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do that during this break for the cage match, and we will be right back.

2348
02:12:11,869 --> 02:12:12,769
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, class.

2349
02:12:13,129 --> 02:12:15,150
[SPEAKER_22]: Our final exam will be coming up at the end of this week.

2350
02:12:15,170 --> 02:12:16,671
[SPEAKER_16]: Our final exam will be in Big Bot Con.

2351
02:12:16,691 --> 02:12:18,811
[SPEAKER_22]: The test will be comprised of 20% written, 30% oral, and 50% anal.

2352
02:12:18,871 --> 02:12:19,652
[SPEAKER_22]: Any questions?

2353
02:12:24,847 --> 02:12:25,588
[SPEAKER_21]: Professor?

2354
02:12:26,128 --> 02:12:26,589
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, dear?

2355
02:12:27,109 --> 02:12:29,431
[SPEAKER_15]: Will there be any extra credit?

2356
02:12:30,192 --> 02:12:32,073
[SPEAKER_22]: I am so glad you asked.

2357
02:13:58,731 --> 02:13:59,318
Thanks for watching!

Thanks for watching!

2359
02:17:03,201 --> 02:17:13,650
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what it is about you that's got me feeling mesmerized Each hour lets you get away while you're the lucky one

2360
02:17:29,021 --> 02:17:32,795
I got my hands full up as it is But I want you Gonna put you

2361
02:18:02,018 --> 02:18:03,160

2362
02:18:23,171 --> 02:18:25,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I don't have another song queued up, so I'm going to find one right now.

2363
02:18:26,354 --> 02:18:34,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, let's do another song from the new DDR that everybody's freaking... DDR Explain.

2364
02:18:35,722 --> 02:18:36,662
[SPEAKER_03]: ...wetting their pants about.

2365
02:18:36,683 --> 02:18:37,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is it?

2366
02:18:37,283 --> 02:18:39,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it on... Oh, I'm looking at the wrong CD.

2367
02:18:39,705 --> 02:18:40,205
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on your CD?

2368
02:18:40,286 --> 02:18:41,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay, never mind.

2369
02:18:42,367 --> 02:18:42,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we'll do this.

2370
02:18:42,968 --> 02:18:48,773
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do Paranoia Survivor from the new DDR Extreme, and then we'll come back and we've got a list list for you guys.

2371
02:20:28,107 --> 02:20:29,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio.

2372
02:20:29,689 --> 02:20:31,831
[SPEAKER_03]: We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

2373
02:20:38,158 --> 02:20:40,100
[SPEAKER_03]: We're back, Orange Lounge Radio.

2374
02:20:40,561 --> 02:20:44,585
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody is furiously working on their list, because we are going to do a list list.

2375
02:20:45,206 --> 02:20:48,690
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, I want to announce the winner of the cage match.

2376
02:20:49,707 --> 02:20:51,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Very close, by the way.

2377
02:20:51,269 --> 02:20:56,958
[SPEAKER_03]: This song won, the other two were tied, and this song had one vote more than the other two.

2378
02:20:57,079 --> 02:20:58,220
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was very close.

2379
02:20:58,701 --> 02:21:02,647
[SPEAKER_03]: The winner of this week's cage match, once again, Ayumi Hamasaki with Connected.

2380
02:21:08,604 --> 02:21:12,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so that goes into a rotation on the station for another week.

2381
02:21:12,665 --> 02:21:13,906
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing over there, Jamie?

2382
02:21:14,246 --> 02:21:15,326
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm ready to do the list list.

2383
02:21:15,506 --> 02:21:18,747
[SPEAKER_28]: You're having that sad, sad spinster look on your face.

2384
02:21:18,767 --> 02:21:28,011
[SPEAKER_16]: It's because my number three song, I'm trying to imagine, my number three choice, I'm trying to imagine what it would be like, because we haven't even announced our list list yet, what it's going to be.

2385
02:21:28,451 --> 02:21:29,131
[SPEAKER_16]: Why don't you tell them?

2386
02:21:29,431 --> 02:21:32,012
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we're doing one for Top Song...

2387
02:21:33,169 --> 02:21:34,633
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2388
02:21:41,360 --> 02:21:41,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Fireball

2389
02:22:12,970 --> 02:22:14,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that song would be funny in 2DX.

2390
02:22:15,511 --> 02:22:17,252
[SPEAKER_17]: I can kind of imagine how it would go.

2391
02:22:17,272 --> 02:22:21,293
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you can only get so much of the trance and Eurobeat stuff.

2392
02:22:21,313 --> 02:22:23,234
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see something a little funky in 2DX.

2393
02:22:23,294 --> 02:22:26,895
[SPEAKER_03]: So Fireball is my number three pick for what ought to be in 2DX from another Blondie game.

2394
02:22:27,375 --> 02:22:28,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go over to Angel.

2395
02:22:28,856 --> 02:22:31,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Your number three choice is... Oh, you only have two so far?

2396
02:22:33,878 --> 02:22:35,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, yes, that song is on it.

2397
02:22:36,499 --> 02:22:37,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel's got to think of another one?

2398
02:22:38,400 --> 02:22:38,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2399
02:22:39,920 --> 02:22:40,320
[SPEAKER_03]: You had one?

2400
02:22:41,901 --> 02:22:42,181
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2401
02:22:44,804 --> 02:22:45,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Number three choice.

2402
02:22:46,765 --> 02:22:47,346
[SPEAKER_16]: Tokyo Already.

2403
02:22:47,926 --> 02:22:49,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Tokyo Already, that's a pretty good one.

2404
02:22:50,888 --> 02:22:53,009
[SPEAKER_16]: It's your beat and your beat's getting big in 2DX.

2405
02:22:54,509 --> 02:22:57,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Tokyo Already, pretty cool song from Dance Maniacs, right?

2406
02:22:58,772 --> 02:23:00,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Monkey Dance is already in 2DX, dummy.

2407
02:23:01,673 --> 02:23:03,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Stressa, your number three pick.

2408
02:23:05,335 --> 02:23:08,417
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, I know it might sound a little hokey, but the...

2409
02:23:09,168 --> 02:23:12,670
[SPEAKER_20]: Idea of having Like a Virgin might be kind of interesting.

2410
02:23:13,030 --> 02:23:15,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a Virgin from Parapara.

2411
02:23:17,913 --> 02:23:18,994
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd want it just for that part.

2412
02:23:19,014 --> 02:23:20,955
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be pretty cool.

2413
02:23:24,037 --> 02:23:24,937
[SPEAKER_27]: Did you already go, Jimmy?

2414
02:23:25,938 --> 02:23:26,718
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going around this way.

2415
02:23:26,778 --> 02:23:27,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2416
02:23:28,099 --> 02:23:30,781
[SPEAKER_03]: My number three, badly, is Superstar.

2417
02:23:31,121 --> 02:23:32,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Superstar.

2418
02:23:34,043 --> 02:23:35,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew you were going to think about that one.

2419
02:23:35,904 --> 02:23:36,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Superstar.

2420
02:23:37,565 --> 02:23:37,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

2421
02:23:37,965 --> 02:23:38,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

2422
02:23:39,385 --> 02:23:41,728
[SPEAKER_08]: This is one of my favorite Dance Maniacs tracks.

2423
02:23:41,788 --> 02:23:42,869
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Mind Parasite.

2424
02:23:43,249 --> 02:23:44,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Mind Parasite.

2425
02:23:44,291 --> 02:23:45,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting choice.

2426
02:23:47,073 --> 02:23:47,694
[SPEAKER_03]: From Dance Maniacs.

2427
02:23:48,115 --> 02:23:48,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, you're number three.

2428
02:23:49,276 --> 02:23:50,978
[SPEAKER_17]: You said you were going... I was going last.

2429
02:23:51,238 --> 02:23:51,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you are.

2430
02:23:51,798 --> 02:23:51,919
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh.

2431
02:23:55,081 --> 02:23:56,062
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

2432
02:24:16,654 --> 02:24:21,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get Hell from Jamie, but I chose Dark Black Forest as my second choice I don't hate the song, it's just overplayed

2433
02:24:46,345 --> 02:24:47,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have to agree with that.

2434
02:24:47,990 --> 02:24:49,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Black Forest should be in 2DX.

2435
02:24:50,799 --> 02:24:51,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Stress out.

2436
02:24:51,601 --> 02:24:52,624
[SPEAKER_20]: My second choice...

2437
02:24:53,675 --> 02:24:53,915
[SPEAKER_20]: Why?

2438
02:24:53,975 --> 02:25:14,525
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I love the beats Boom Boom Dollar Boom Boom Dollar Oh my god, Boom Boom Dollar and 2BX I'm completely sad and pathetic Would be fucking hilarious Have mercy Gee, I thought it was going to be Bumblebee That would be fucking funny, I'm sorry I give it a point for comic value Brad What?

2439
02:25:15,226 --> 02:25:15,486
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2440
02:25:16,246 --> 02:25:17,707
[SPEAKER_27]: Nothing, Dave was just making a joke

2441
02:25:18,243 --> 02:25:21,085
[SPEAKER_05]: He said that he was going to burn his PS2 to the ground if that was on.

2442
02:25:21,125 --> 02:25:26,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'd be like, yes, and then I'd take the ashes and let it rise like a phoenix back into a PS2 and then I'd play it.

2443
02:25:26,889 --> 02:25:27,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Brad, you're number two pick.

2444
02:25:28,951 --> 02:25:30,892
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, thanks to the comedy killer.

2445
02:25:32,013 --> 02:25:34,715
[SPEAKER_27]: My number two pick is Ecstasy, because that song kicks ass.

2446
02:25:34,735 --> 02:25:35,435
[SPEAKER_27]: It owns you all.

2447
02:25:38,057 --> 02:25:39,118
[SPEAKER_16]: It'd be like having insertion.

2448
02:25:41,172 --> 02:25:42,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Ecstasy, Loki.

2449
02:25:42,893 --> 02:25:51,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's only fitting since, you know, if we're talking about a new mix of 2DX, it would obviously be with the new mix of DDR, so why not the Legend of Max?

2450
02:25:52,558 --> 02:25:53,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of Max.

2451
02:25:54,580 --> 02:25:55,700
[SPEAKER_16]: My fingers would fall off.

2452
02:25:57,161 --> 02:25:57,901
[SPEAKER_16]: My turn, my turn, my turn.

2453
02:25:57,921 --> 02:25:58,762
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels like burning.

2454
02:25:59,222 --> 02:26:00,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, you're number two pick.

2455
02:26:00,163 --> 02:26:00,843
[SPEAKER_16]: It feels like burning heat.

2456
02:26:01,604 --> 02:26:02,344
[SPEAKER_16]: My baby mama.

2457
02:26:02,804 --> 02:26:03,945
[SPEAKER_03]: My baby mama.

2458
02:26:04,765 --> 02:26:07,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Think about playing the bass line with that.

2459
02:26:08,067 --> 02:26:09,468
[SPEAKER_16]: Do-do, do-do, do-do.

2460
02:26:09,750 --> 02:26:10,470
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, good pick.

2461
02:26:10,650 --> 02:26:12,011
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, wow, we got a big list already.

2462
02:26:12,031 --> 02:26:13,552
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because there's so many of us participating tonight.

2463
02:26:13,812 --> 02:26:15,093
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, the number one picks.

2464
02:26:15,113 --> 02:26:15,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

2465
02:26:15,533 --> 02:26:19,375
[SPEAKER_03]: The number one song that ought to be in 2DX from another Bomani game.

2466
02:26:19,875 --> 02:26:23,116
[SPEAKER_03]: My choice, Gamlande Couple from Mambo.

2467
02:26:23,737 --> 02:26:25,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that song would kick so much ass in 2DX.

2468
02:26:25,838 --> 02:26:26,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

2469
02:26:29,199 --> 02:26:30,060
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the Mambo one.

2470
02:26:31,360 --> 02:26:32,541
[SPEAKER_03]: You fucking bastard.

2471
02:26:32,921 --> 02:26:34,242
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

2472
02:26:34,262 --> 02:26:35,102
[SPEAKER_03]: We can have a dupe.

2473
02:26:35,122 --> 02:26:35,522
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

2474
02:26:35,682 --> 02:26:36,203
[SPEAKER_03]: We can have a dupe.

2475
02:26:36,223 --> 02:26:36,603
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

2476
02:26:37,083 --> 02:26:37,423
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2477
02:26:38,424 --> 02:26:38,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel.

2478
02:26:40,638 --> 02:26:43,359
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, this is my personal favorite at the moment.

2479
02:26:43,959 --> 02:26:44,859
[SPEAKER_18]: I chose Eurobeat.

2480
02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:47,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Eurobeat, go!

2481
02:26:47,320 --> 02:26:51,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, 6th style had a lot of pair of songs in it, so Eurobeat would definitely fit in.

2482
02:26:51,842 --> 02:26:53,862
[SPEAKER_03]: So Eurobeat, Angel's number one choice.

2483
02:26:55,243 --> 02:27:01,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, since we talked about... Oh, I'm being told that Gamelan Day Couple's in Beatmania the final.

2484
02:27:01,625 --> 02:27:02,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Can somebody give me...

2485
02:27:03,377 --> 02:27:06,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that's right, we're talking about 2DX, not 5Key, 2DX.

2486
02:27:07,018 --> 02:27:07,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha!

2487
02:27:08,358 --> 02:27:08,738
[SPEAKER_20]: 7Key stuff.

2488
02:27:09,078 --> 02:27:09,618
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, thank you.

2489
02:27:10,158 --> 02:27:14,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know that though, that's still pretty cool if it's in Beatmania the final, but that's not 2DX.

2490
02:27:15,039 --> 02:27:15,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha.

2491
02:27:16,020 --> 02:27:21,861
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, my first, since we talked about burning, let's talk about some burning heat.

2492
02:27:22,621 --> 02:27:23,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Burning heat is in 2DX, actually.

2493
02:27:24,141 --> 02:27:24,541
[SPEAKER_20]: Burning heat?

2494
02:27:25,021 --> 02:27:25,121
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh.

2495
02:27:25,822 --> 02:27:26,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoops.

2496
02:27:26,102 --> 02:27:26,442
[SPEAKER_20]: Well then.

2497
02:27:27,622 --> 02:27:28,982
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, sucks to be me.

2498
02:27:31,043 --> 02:27:31,743
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me think some more.

2499
02:27:31,783 --> 02:27:32,843
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2500
02:27:34,352 --> 02:27:35,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we'll come back to Streza.

2501
02:27:35,792 --> 02:27:36,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.

2502
02:27:37,293 --> 02:27:43,975
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, my number one, and the best song in the world, the Miracle Moon remix by L.E.D.

2503
02:27:44,335 --> 02:27:46,696
[SPEAKER_27]: Which was in Beatmania as well, but needs to be in 2DX.

2504
02:27:46,716 --> 02:27:49,797
[SPEAKER_27]: It needs to be in 2DX with harder notes and stuff, that would be awesome.

2505
02:27:50,777 --> 02:27:51,838
[SPEAKER_27]: I would jizz in my panties.

2506
02:27:56,579 --> 02:27:57,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm gonna take my noose off now.

2507
02:28:02,460 --> 02:28:10,844
[SPEAKER_26]: Since Rob was a bastard and stole my number one, I'm going to just pick this really way off one here.

2508
02:28:11,764 --> 02:28:12,385
[SPEAKER_26]: Kachaka.

2509
02:28:13,125 --> 02:28:13,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Kachaka.

2510
02:28:13,885 --> 02:28:15,826
[SPEAKER_17]: I almost picked that.

2511
02:28:17,487 --> 02:28:19,268
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I spelled Kachaka wrong, but whatever.

2512
02:28:21,489 --> 02:28:22,109
[SPEAKER_16]: My number one?

2513
02:28:23,550 --> 02:28:24,050
[SPEAKER_16]: Klung Klung.

2514
02:28:24,811 --> 02:28:25,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Klung Klung.

2515
02:28:26,151 --> 02:28:27,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good one.

2516
02:28:30,615 --> 02:28:32,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Good one from Keyboard Mania.

2517
02:28:32,297 --> 02:28:32,898
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good pick.

2518
02:28:33,138 --> 02:28:34,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Did Stresso come up with one?

2519
02:28:34,259 --> 02:28:35,140
[SPEAKER_20]: How about Captain Jack?

2520
02:28:35,741 --> 02:28:36,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Captain Jack!

2521
02:28:36,702 --> 02:28:39,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Because no Bombani game is complete without Captain Jack.

2522
02:28:39,885 --> 02:28:40,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.

2523
02:28:40,646 --> 02:28:41,867
[SPEAKER_16]: And if he wasn't there, he'd cry.

2524
02:28:45,912 --> 02:28:46,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you shut that?

2525
02:28:46,712 --> 02:28:47,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that you?

2526
02:28:51,100 --> 02:29:07,420
[SPEAKER_16]: Fireball, Tokyo Already, Like A Virgin, Superstar, Mind Parasite, On The Jazz, Ghosts, Dark Black Forest, Boom Boom Dollar, S2Z, Legend of Max, why is it saying that Boom is misspelled?

2527
02:29:08,041 --> 02:29:12,523
[SPEAKER_16]: Legend of Max, My Baby Mama, Guacamole De Couple, Eurobeat, Miracle Moon LED Mix, Kachaka, Clone Clone 1655, and Captain Jack.

2528
02:29:23,553 --> 02:29:23,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

2529
02:29:25,434 --> 02:29:27,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Some votes from the chat room.

2530
02:29:27,815 --> 02:29:30,696
[SPEAKER_03]: They said we didn't put any erotic on this list and they're very sad.

2531
02:29:30,716 --> 02:29:31,996
[SPEAKER_16]: There's already erotic though in 5Key.

2532
02:29:32,316 --> 02:29:33,457
[SPEAKER_03]: There is erotic in 5Key.

2533
02:29:33,497 --> 02:29:35,357
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually Captain Jack in 5Key as well.

2534
02:29:36,138 --> 02:29:37,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, that's 5Key.

2535
02:29:37,078 --> 02:29:37,418
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not 2DX.

2536
02:29:37,478 --> 02:29:38,218
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the same thing.

2537
02:29:38,858 --> 02:29:40,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's everybody's favorite part.

2538
02:29:40,319 --> 02:29:44,641
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the elimination round where one song, sorry kids, it's got to come off this list.

2539
02:29:44,681 --> 02:29:45,481
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a hard one.

2540
02:29:46,461 --> 02:29:48,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I guess I'll start.

2541
02:29:48,943 --> 02:29:53,367
[SPEAKER_03]: One song that's gotta come off this list, uh, for 2DX that I don't want to see in 2DX.

2542
02:29:54,348 --> 02:29:59,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... Boom Boom Dollar.

2543
02:29:59,452 --> 02:30:01,394
[SPEAKER_03]: That's forever and always a DDR song.

2544
02:30:01,414 --> 02:30:02,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see it in 2DX, sorry.

2545
02:30:03,395 --> 02:30:04,576
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm taking Boom Boom Dollar off the list.

2546
02:30:05,937 --> 02:30:07,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel, take one of these songs off the list.

2547
02:30:09,400 --> 02:30:09,941
[SPEAKER_18]: Big list.

2548
02:30:10,942 --> 02:30:11,442
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a big list.

2549
02:30:13,203 --> 02:30:14,745
[SPEAKER_18]: Do do do do do do do.

2550
02:30:16,565 --> 02:30:17,805
[SPEAKER_18]: The Guacamole song.

2551
02:30:19,046 --> 02:30:20,406
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, damn you.

2552
02:30:20,506 --> 02:30:21,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn you.

2553
02:30:21,867 --> 02:30:22,107
[SPEAKER_18]: Why?

2554
02:30:22,147 --> 02:30:23,027
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I don't know it.

2555
02:30:23,087 --> 02:30:23,647
[SPEAKER_18]: My bad.

2556
02:30:25,168 --> 02:30:26,208
[SPEAKER_18]: We should play that during the break then.

2557
02:30:26,228 --> 02:30:27,229
[SPEAKER_26]: You're a bad woman.

2558
02:30:28,049 --> 02:30:29,810
[SPEAKER_26]: Rob, I just heard the news.

2559
02:30:30,890 --> 02:30:32,891
[SPEAKER_26]: I heard that you have a bad case of balloon fight.

2560
02:30:34,911 --> 02:30:36,412
[SPEAKER_26]: I've heard that Penicillin can cure this.

2561
02:30:37,112 --> 02:30:37,872
[SPEAKER_26]: Along with Sega.

2562
02:30:40,413 --> 02:30:41,754
[SPEAKER_26]: Sega!

2563
02:30:42,274 --> 02:30:43,134
[SPEAKER_26]: What are you doing here?

2564
02:30:44,655 --> 02:30:45,835
[SPEAKER_26]: Molesting you, apparently.

2565
02:30:48,493 --> 02:30:49,553
[SPEAKER_26]: Hold on a second, okay, I'll see here.

2566
02:30:49,753 --> 02:30:51,474
[SPEAKER_26]: Fireball took it already, like a virgin.

2567
02:30:51,494 --> 02:30:53,195
[SPEAKER_26]: Superstar, Mind Parasite, I'm the Jazz.

2568
02:30:53,455 --> 02:30:58,036
[SPEAKER_26]: Ghost, Dark Black Forest, Ecstasy, Legend of Max, My Baby Mama, Eurobeat.

2569
02:30:59,437 --> 02:30:59,897
[SPEAKER_26]: Eurobeat?

2570
02:31:01,658 --> 02:31:02,238
[SPEAKER_26]: Miracle Moon.

2571
02:31:03,988 --> 02:31:04,629
[SPEAKER_26]: What the hell is that?

2572
02:31:04,649 --> 02:31:05,109
[SPEAKER_26]: T'Chaka.

2573
02:31:05,229 --> 02:31:05,829
[SPEAKER_26]: T'Chaka.

2574
02:31:06,810 --> 02:31:10,453
[SPEAKER_26]: Klung Klung 1655 and Captain Jack.

2575
02:31:10,593 --> 02:31:11,014
[SPEAKER_26]: Captain Jack.

2576
02:31:11,334 --> 02:31:12,275
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll tell you what, here we go.

2577
02:31:12,415 --> 02:31:13,976
[SPEAKER_26]: Just delete everything except Captain Jack.

2578
02:31:14,636 --> 02:31:15,437
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all set.

2579
02:31:16,158 --> 02:31:17,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Captain Jack is loved.

2580
02:31:18,339 --> 02:31:18,720
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2581
02:31:21,162 --> 02:31:21,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving along.

2582
02:31:22,302 --> 02:31:23,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Stressa, what comes off the list?

2583
02:31:24,344 --> 02:31:28,567
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, Angel, but Dark Black Forest must go.

2584
02:31:29,288 --> 02:31:29,828
[SPEAKER_18]: It's all good.

2585
02:31:29,868 --> 02:31:30,409
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't hate you.

2586
02:31:31,900 --> 02:31:32,861
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll get a beating later.

2587
02:31:33,161 --> 02:31:33,542
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

2588
02:31:34,163 --> 02:31:34,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Jerk.

2589
02:31:34,964 --> 02:31:35,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2590
02:31:35,705 --> 02:31:36,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Badly.

2591
02:31:36,626 --> 02:31:37,387
[SPEAKER_27]: I want to go last.

2592
02:31:38,248 --> 02:31:38,509
[SPEAKER_27]: Tough.

2593
02:31:40,231 --> 02:31:40,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a pony.

2594
02:31:41,753 --> 02:31:41,993
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway.

2595
02:31:45,615 --> 02:31:48,357
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't want to piss anybody off because they'll take mine away.

2596
02:31:49,378 --> 02:31:51,600
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to have to go with Captain Jack.

2597
02:31:52,941 --> 02:31:56,183
[SPEAKER_03]: You bastard taking Captain Jack off the list.

2598
02:31:56,864 --> 02:31:57,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you die.

2599
02:31:57,924 --> 02:31:58,925
[SPEAKER_03]: That's alright.

2600
02:31:58,965 --> 02:31:59,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

2601
02:31:59,706 --> 02:32:04,690
[SPEAKER_18]: As payback for you taking off my song from the list, I still say you're a dirty cowgirl!

2602
02:32:06,891 --> 02:32:07,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

2603
02:32:08,673 --> 02:32:17,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because I'm not a huge fan of this song in both DDR and Beatmania, buh-bye, Miracle Moon.

2604
02:32:18,500 --> 02:32:19,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Miracle Moon.

2605
02:32:20,602 --> 02:32:22,503
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, you will rot in hell for this.

2606
02:32:22,823 --> 02:32:24,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Miracle Moon comes off the list.

2607
02:32:24,064 --> 02:32:26,406
[SPEAKER_03]: The weed of crime bears bitter fruit, you old hag.

2608
02:32:26,426 --> 02:32:28,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's come off the number one end.

2609
02:32:28,247 --> 02:32:30,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, heroin Miracle Moon.

2610
02:32:30,949 --> 02:32:31,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn you, Loki.

2611
02:32:32,530 --> 02:32:35,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie gets the privilege of being the last one to remove a song.

2612
02:32:39,085 --> 02:32:45,528
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I'm going to have to go with taking off Eurobeat.

2613
02:32:46,749 --> 02:32:51,031
[SPEAKER_16]: Just because as far as having a Eurobeat song goes in 2DX, that one wouldn't be much of a challenge.

2614
02:32:51,831 --> 02:32:55,893
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't have a lot of neat synthy stuff going on.

2615
02:32:56,234 --> 02:33:00,636
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have the final list that our chatroom now gets to vote on.

2616
02:33:01,256 --> 02:33:03,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me your votes over a private message in the chatroom right now.

2617
02:33:03,717 --> 02:33:05,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, tell them what their picks are.

2618
02:33:05,478 --> 02:33:16,526
[SPEAKER_16]: Fireball, Tokyo Already, Like A Virgin, Superstar, Mind Parasite, On The Jazz, Ghosts, Estacy, Legend of Max, My Baby Mama, Kachaka, and Kling Kling 6055.

2619
02:33:16,586 --> 02:33:18,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Sky's Voice, the game is not an option.

2620
02:33:19,008 --> 02:33:21,690
[SPEAKER_03]: If you vote for that, it doesn't count.

2621
02:33:21,810 --> 02:33:22,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't waste your vote.

2622
02:33:22,771 --> 02:33:26,354
[SPEAKER_16]: By the way, this is yet another week that all of my choices have stayed up.

2623
02:33:27,495 --> 02:33:28,355
[SPEAKER_03]: You're special.

2624
02:33:28,595 --> 02:33:28,916
I am.

2625
02:33:31,137 --> 02:33:32,999
[SPEAKER_16]: My movie pick got voted off last week.

2626
02:33:34,028 --> 02:33:39,763
[SPEAKER_03]: And just for Angel and anyone else that may not know, here it is, Gamland, a couple, while we tally the votes.

2627
02:33:39,843 --> 02:33:40,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Send them in right now.

2628
02:35:27,441 --> 02:35:28,262
Thanks for watching!

2629
02:35:58,326 --> 02:35:58,988
Thanks for watching!

2630
02:38:05,443 --> 02:38:06,685
I don't know.

2631
02:38:46,551 --> 02:38:47,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

2632
02:39:23,321 --> 02:39:24,248
Thank you for watching

2633
02:39:50,901 --> 02:40:04,124
No, no, nobody loves me, no, nobody loves me, no, nobody loves me, I'm takin' your heart

2634
02:40:19,893 --> 02:40:22,176
[SPEAKER_12]: Bitch, get a new song.

2635
02:40:22,276 --> 02:40:24,979
[SPEAKER_12]: An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

2636
02:40:35,086 --> 02:40:37,186
[SPEAKER_03]: We are back and I'm having my picture taken.

2637
02:40:37,607 --> 02:40:38,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there, that was fun.

2638
02:40:38,827 --> 02:40:39,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2639
02:40:39,807 --> 02:40:40,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Wee.

2640
02:40:40,527 --> 02:40:41,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I got flashed by Angel.

2641
02:40:42,007 --> 02:40:42,568
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty cool.

2642
02:40:44,008 --> 02:40:50,669
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the results, ladies and gentlemen, of the listless song from any other Bomani game that ought to be in 2DX.

2643
02:40:51,570 --> 02:40:52,230
[SPEAKER_03]: That isn't yet.

2644
02:40:52,790 --> 02:40:53,330
[SPEAKER_03]: And here it is.

2645
02:40:53,430 --> 02:40:54,670
[SPEAKER_03]: The number three choice.

2646
02:40:55,230 --> 02:40:57,591
[SPEAKER_03]: You voted Superstar.

2647
02:40:59,371 --> 02:41:00,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.

2648
02:41:01,032 --> 02:41:02,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad, can't you do the rap?

2649
02:41:02,092 --> 02:41:02,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you do the rap for us?

2650
02:41:04,943 --> 02:41:07,925
[SPEAKER_27]: Don't make me bust out my white honky rap skills on y'all ass.

2651
02:41:07,965 --> 02:41:09,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, Emma Brad.

2652
02:41:09,185 --> 02:41:10,846
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't even remember how it goes.

2653
02:41:11,767 --> 02:41:12,567
[SPEAKER_27]: My name is Chaos.

2654
02:41:12,587 --> 02:41:13,108
[SPEAKER_27]: No, it's my name.

2655
02:41:13,128 --> 02:41:13,708
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I remember.

2656
02:41:14,008 --> 02:41:15,409
[SPEAKER_27]: I am here and my name is Chaos.

2657
02:41:15,449 --> 02:41:15,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

2658
02:41:16,730 --> 02:41:19,051
[SPEAKER_27]: Rap is to me like VD is to Amadeus.

2659
02:41:22,173 --> 02:41:22,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

2660
02:41:23,614 --> 02:41:24,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two pick.

2661
02:41:24,534 --> 02:41:25,115
[SPEAKER_03]: You picked it.

2662
02:41:25,275 --> 02:41:27,136
[SPEAKER_03]: The number two winner is Klunk Klunk 1655.

2663
02:41:27,196 --> 02:41:27,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Winner.

2664
02:41:27,556 --> 02:41:29,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm winner.

2665
02:41:29,217 --> 02:41:29,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Winner.

2666
02:41:30,558 --> 02:41:31,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Keyboard Mania, In the House.

2667
02:41:32,459 --> 02:41:32,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Ought to be on TDR.

2668
02:41:32,879 --> 02:41:33,139
[SPEAKER_03]: In the House.

2669
02:41:35,538 --> 02:41:49,042
[SPEAKER_03]: and the winner, this kind of makes me sad a little bit, because I know it'll be in 2DX anyway, but you did vote it, your number one choice, by quite a landslide, ladies and gentlemen, Legend of Max, as the song that ought to be in 2DX.

2670
02:41:49,062 --> 02:41:50,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Then why didn't anyone take it off the list?

2671
02:41:51,043 --> 02:41:53,624
[SPEAKER_03]: You're all groaning, but why didn't anyone take it off the list if you don't like it?

2672
02:41:55,384 --> 02:41:56,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see, I see.

2673
02:41:56,245 --> 02:41:56,665
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you say?

2674
02:41:58,725 --> 02:42:03,087
[SPEAKER_14]: I said... That sounded like a wet shit.

2675
02:42:05,794 --> 02:42:10,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, alright, that was the winning song.

2676
02:42:10,340 --> 02:42:15,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, don't give me dots, don't give me dots, you voted it, alright?

2677
02:42:15,727 --> 02:42:16,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's your fault.

2678
02:42:17,269 --> 02:42:18,010
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your fault.

2679
02:42:19,045 --> 02:42:20,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob's Voice The Game!

2680
02:42:20,385 --> 02:42:21,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob's Voice The Game!

2681
02:42:22,326 --> 02:42:22,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

2682
02:42:23,226 --> 02:42:23,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

2683
02:42:24,067 --> 02:42:26,967
[SPEAKER_03]: What would a game to my voice be?

2684
02:42:27,047 --> 02:42:27,788
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be awesome.

2685
02:42:28,448 --> 02:42:33,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I could make a song using your voice as the, you know, kind of like... Fine.

2686
02:42:33,349 --> 02:42:35,290
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be called Legend of Let Them Move.

2687
02:42:35,730 --> 02:42:38,511
[SPEAKER_03]: The honorary number one winner is Sky's Voice The Game.

2688
02:42:38,551 --> 02:42:39,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you happy?

2689
02:42:40,471 --> 02:42:40,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you happy?

2690
02:42:42,052 --> 02:42:42,232
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2691
02:42:44,648 --> 02:42:47,892
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Pantsless Rage, the game?

2692
02:42:48,253 --> 02:42:48,674
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay!

2693
02:42:49,975 --> 02:42:51,217
[SPEAKER_16]: Pantsless Rage wins!

2694
02:42:54,241 --> 02:42:58,367
[SPEAKER_27]: Like that game Seaman from Dreamcast, except it's going to be rage and he's going to be pantsless.

2695
02:42:59,328 --> 02:43:00,750
[SPEAKER_16]: Is he going to grow from a mushroom?

2696
02:43:01,880 --> 02:43:02,180
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

2697
02:43:03,080 --> 02:43:04,941
[SPEAKER_16]: After you take the mushrooms, you'll see them grow.

2698
02:43:05,521 --> 02:43:11,202
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what's funny is you're growing that guy, Seaman, and he ends up being a boss in a Konami game.

2699
02:43:11,242 --> 02:43:12,382
[SPEAKER_08]: What is up with that, you know?

2700
02:43:13,643 --> 02:43:18,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't that guy from Seaman look just like the boss that's in Contra, the new Contra game?

2701
02:43:19,164 --> 02:43:19,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2702
02:43:19,924 --> 02:43:20,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the shriveled space piece.

2703
02:43:20,924 --> 02:43:21,665
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, I'm coming undone.

2704
02:43:21,685 --> 02:43:22,465
[SPEAKER_29]: Ah, ah, ah.

2705
02:43:24,085 --> 02:43:24,445
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, shit.

2706
02:43:24,465 --> 02:43:25,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Talking about that fish.

2707
02:43:25,806 --> 02:43:26,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2708
02:43:26,286 --> 02:43:28,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it all over the ground.

2709
02:43:29,307 --> 02:43:33,109
[SPEAKER_03]: They're suggesting in the chat room that Rob's voice the game Slut Edition.

2710
02:43:36,030 --> 02:43:36,971
[SPEAKER_03]: That is so you are.

2711
02:43:38,231 --> 02:43:38,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Who told?

2712
02:43:39,091 --> 02:43:41,512
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know what y'all got against politics.

2713
02:43:41,712 --> 02:43:43,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Gumby says Pantsless Sky voiced the game.

2714
02:43:44,133 --> 02:43:44,494
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2715
02:43:44,734 --> 02:43:45,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell no.

2716
02:43:46,334 --> 02:43:46,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell no.

2717
02:43:46,534 --> 02:43:47,675
[SPEAKER_03]: But you wanted to show off your cock.

2718
02:43:48,855 --> 02:43:50,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Only in a freestyle routine.

2719
02:43:50,036 --> 02:43:52,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to show off my cock.

2720
02:43:52,398 --> 02:43:53,358
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?

2721
02:43:53,398 --> 02:43:54,259
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just radio.

2722
02:43:54,579 --> 02:43:55,420
[SPEAKER_03]: That's radio funny.

2723
02:43:55,460 --> 02:43:56,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you weren't here for that.

2724
02:43:56,901 --> 02:44:01,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, why doesn't anybody in a DDR freestyle routine whip out their cock at the end of an event?

2725
02:44:02,665 --> 02:44:04,146
[SPEAKER_16]: Everyone knows you're just a big old slut.

2726
02:44:05,246 --> 02:44:05,567
[SPEAKER_16]: Ha ha.

2727
02:44:06,107 --> 02:44:08,108
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, I heard it was a male slut.

2728
02:44:08,269 --> 02:44:09,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does everybody think I'm a slut?

2729
02:44:09,690 --> 02:44:11,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't gotten laid in forever and you all think I'm a slut?

2730
02:44:11,931 --> 02:44:13,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Slut, slut, what?

2731
02:44:13,592 --> 02:44:14,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha.

2732
02:44:15,939 --> 02:44:16,960
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, here you go again.

2733
02:44:17,320 --> 02:44:18,981
[SPEAKER_27]: Fucking cappin' on Paul Terry.

2734
02:44:19,261 --> 02:44:23,984
[SPEAKER_27]: One of the most... She is the most... the most... Wait, no, no, no, no.

2735
02:44:24,284 --> 02:44:26,906
[SPEAKER_27]: She's the most talented musician in the world.

2736
02:44:27,727 --> 02:44:28,087
[SPEAKER_27]: Ever.

2737
02:44:29,908 --> 02:44:31,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, too bad she's Naoki.

2738
02:44:33,010 --> 02:44:34,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this before or after she gave you a blowjob?

2739
02:44:35,932 --> 02:44:40,575
[SPEAKER_05]: She may be the most talented musician in the world, but she's not talented at music.

2740
02:44:40,935 --> 02:44:42,116
[SPEAKER_05]: She's talented in other ways.

2741
02:44:42,156 --> 02:44:43,537
[SPEAKER_05]: She's just also a musician.

2742
02:44:45,906 --> 02:44:46,553
[SPEAKER_27]: That may be so.

2743
02:44:48,117 --> 02:44:51,458
[SPEAKER_08]: They're having a group orgy, it's Hybroid Ruby, the group orgy, okay?

2744
02:44:51,478 --> 02:45:07,585
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got, you know, the DDR All-Stars, which is basically, you know, B4U, you know, all them buck naked, freaking just getting freaky, and then you've got, then you've got Politary in the mix there, and some other chick that we don't remember her name because she doesn't really matter, because they all suck, and then, ew, then Naoki's in there.

2745
02:45:07,765 --> 02:45:10,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, screw Naoki, he can be out of, he can be filming.

2746
02:45:10,687 --> 02:45:12,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I think Jenny Rom's a bigger slut than Politary.

2747
02:45:13,088 --> 02:45:15,709
[SPEAKER_16]: We already know that half of B4U is really Naoki, too.

2748
02:45:16,994 --> 02:45:19,336
[SPEAKER_27]: Have you heard the new Polytary song where she plays a didgeridoo?

2749
02:45:20,236 --> 02:45:21,017
[SPEAKER_27]: Come on, guys!

2750
02:45:21,077 --> 02:45:21,997
[SPEAKER_27]: She's Australian!

2751
02:45:22,117 --> 02:45:23,058
[SPEAKER_27]: Fucking kill my joke!

2752
02:45:23,358 --> 02:45:24,759
[SPEAKER_27]: There's been a sniper shooting!

2753
02:45:28,421 --> 02:45:30,803
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, she stopped doing the didgeridoo sound, that's right.

2754
02:45:34,805 --> 02:45:38,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, I like Black Lab's term for Polytary, Austrasian.

2755
02:45:39,228 --> 02:45:40,049
[SPEAKER_03]: She's Austrasian.

2756
02:45:51,657 --> 02:45:56,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh god, they're criticizing me because we've said slut like 20 times and haven't played the thing.

2757
02:45:56,082 --> 02:46:01,307
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie, stop advertising!

2758
02:46:01,327 --> 02:46:04,310
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought you needed to be pressed, Rob.

2759
02:46:24,883 --> 02:46:25,664
[SPEAKER_29]: All right, that's enough.

2760
02:46:25,984 --> 02:46:28,507
[SPEAKER_16]: We hate Paula Terry and we want all her balls to die.

2761
02:46:28,967 --> 02:46:35,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what this chat room is obsessed with my cock and me giving lap dances and me being a slut and like all this other stuff.

2762
02:46:40,578 --> 02:46:41,519
[SPEAKER_03]: This is scary.

2763
02:46:41,979 --> 02:46:42,680
[SPEAKER_16]: I need the chat room.

2764
02:46:42,860 --> 02:46:44,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you call Matt a slut?

2765
02:46:44,141 --> 02:46:45,062
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a bigger slut than I am.

2766
02:46:45,082 --> 02:46:45,843
[SPEAKER_16]: You said it again.

2767
02:46:54,144 --> 02:46:54,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm sorry, what?

2768
02:46:56,945 --> 02:46:59,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, he is correct, but that's not the point, okay?

2769
02:47:02,848 --> 02:47:04,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I am the biggest slut of them all.

2770
02:47:05,789 --> 02:47:06,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry, Rob.

2771
02:47:11,552 --> 02:47:12,652
[SPEAKER_03]: All your sluts are belong to us.

2772
02:47:15,133 --> 02:47:16,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just gonna do the hotkey here.

2773
02:47:23,615 --> 02:47:26,958
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, hey, they have loose sloths in Reno.

2774
02:47:27,639 --> 02:47:28,940
[SPEAKER_27]: Tricked you, almost got you.

2775
02:47:28,960 --> 02:47:35,346
[SPEAKER_27]: Thought I was going to say slut, but... They need to change it until you're in my parts.

2776
02:47:39,169 --> 02:47:43,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, in the chat room, they're saying, Matt is not a slut, he's a one-woman man-whore.

2777
02:47:44,254 --> 02:47:44,734
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cute.

2778
02:47:46,756 --> 02:47:47,137
[SPEAKER_16]: I still...

2779
02:47:48,448 --> 02:47:53,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, SoCalKicks suggests Dave is a slut to his hand.

2780
02:47:58,654 --> 02:47:59,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Jamie.

2781
02:47:59,415 --> 02:48:00,816
[SPEAKER_16]: He's a slut to the Crisco can.

2782
02:48:11,162 --> 02:48:12,403
[SPEAKER_26]: Crisco doesn't work?

2783
02:48:13,844 --> 02:48:15,065
[SPEAKER_26]: The hell are you talking about?

2784
02:48:15,105 --> 02:48:17,206
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you suggest, being the expert on the show?

2785
02:48:17,884 --> 02:48:18,404
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know, man.

2786
02:48:18,805 --> 02:48:19,445
[SPEAKER_26]: Saliva!

2787
02:48:23,048 --> 02:48:26,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here's my opinion on the whole... God, I can't believe we've finally brought this on the show.

2788
02:48:27,292 --> 02:48:27,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It's over.

2789
02:48:27,913 --> 02:48:30,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the last episode of Orange Mountain, everybody.

2790
02:48:30,895 --> 02:48:31,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Bomani what?

2791
02:48:31,636 --> 02:48:32,296
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR what?

2792
02:48:32,757 --> 02:48:33,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, let's see here.

2793
02:48:35,019 --> 02:48:39,222
[SPEAKER_03]: See, the thing that really sucks about all those freaking loops is they get sticky after a while, okay?

2794
02:48:39,703 --> 02:48:40,844
[SPEAKER_03]: That just sucks, okay?

2795
02:48:41,304 --> 02:48:43,486
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, no more masturbation chat.

2796
02:48:44,227 --> 02:48:45,488
[SPEAKER_16]: We need Mr. Spanky for this.

2797
02:48:47,938 --> 02:48:56,922
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, you just get two Ziploc bags, you fill them with hot water and you tape them together so they're kind of like a little, you know, and you just... Oh my god, Jameson!

2798
02:48:56,942 --> 02:48:57,662
[SPEAKER_27]: What was that, Jamie?

2799
02:48:58,382 --> 02:48:59,703
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a C-bomb!

2800
02:49:00,503 --> 02:49:00,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh!

2801
02:49:00,963 --> 02:49:01,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Did Delay get that?

2802
02:49:02,824 --> 02:49:04,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if the mics got it or what.

2803
02:49:04,665 --> 02:49:05,505
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have a Delay.

2804
02:49:05,545 --> 02:49:06,825
[SPEAKER_03]: We're shitty radio, remember?

2805
02:49:09,967 --> 02:49:11,147
[SPEAKER_27]: That was beautiful, Jamie.

2806
02:49:11,487 --> 02:49:12,227
[SPEAKER_27]: That was so awesome.

2807
02:49:13,148 --> 02:49:15,849
[SPEAKER_27]: Remember, folks, the FCC does not approve of Orange Lounge Radio.

2808
02:49:18,632 --> 02:49:19,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck the FCC.

2809
02:49:19,692 --> 02:49:22,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck the FCC with Chrisco's sticky lube.

2810
02:49:25,273 --> 02:49:27,614
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about the Ziploc bags in the water.

2811
02:49:29,474 --> 02:49:30,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Sluts.

2812
02:49:30,094 --> 02:49:31,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Two Ziploc bags.

2813
02:49:31,494 --> 02:49:33,314
[SPEAKER_16]: This sounds like... We have a slut call.

2814
02:49:35,735 --> 02:49:39,576
[SPEAKER_16]: And for the record, I said like a big old cut.

2815
02:49:42,856 --> 02:49:48,037
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, we have a suggestion from the chat room that we need to change the topic and we should talk about cake.

2816
02:49:49,191 --> 02:49:51,332
[SPEAKER_28]: Frankly, I think cake makes a crappy lube.

2817
02:49:54,714 --> 02:49:55,774
[SPEAKER_29]: Frosting, maybe.

2818
02:49:58,315 --> 02:49:59,976
[SPEAKER_16]: You can do so many fun things with frosting.

2819
02:50:00,596 --> 02:50:01,637
[SPEAKER_16]: There's the butter spray.

2820
02:50:03,898 --> 02:50:11,521
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, I think that we should actually get the tips from the people who actually have cocks.

2821
02:50:13,222 --> 02:50:15,303
[SPEAKER_16]: So, cockmasters, speak up.

2822
02:50:17,990 --> 02:50:23,133
[SPEAKER_08]: What they really need is to coat your cock in Teflon, okay?

2823
02:50:27,495 --> 02:50:28,876
[SPEAKER_29]: Because nothing will stick to it?

2824
02:50:28,936 --> 02:50:30,017
[SPEAKER_29]: Is that why they need that?

2825
02:50:30,057 --> 02:50:33,298
[SPEAKER_29]: But how do they get Teflon to stick to your dick if nothing sticks to Teflon?

2826
02:50:33,478 --> 02:50:34,719
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, how do they do it with pots?

2827
02:50:34,859 --> 02:50:36,860
[SPEAKER_16]: Shit, man, how do they do it there?

2828
02:50:37,701 --> 02:50:38,001
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

2829
02:50:38,061 --> 02:50:38,741
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, okay, okay.

2830
02:50:38,821 --> 02:50:41,983
[SPEAKER_16]: Enough cock-stroking chat.

2831
02:50:42,303 --> 02:50:43,984
[SPEAKER_16]: You're all a bunch of cockmasters.

2832
02:50:44,784 --> 02:50:45,485
[SPEAKER_27]: I resent that.

2833
02:50:46,579 --> 02:50:47,920
[SPEAKER_16]: You're not the master of your cock?

2834
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,943
[SPEAKER_27]: I want to talk about that Jones soda you had the other day, Rob.

2835
02:50:52,964 --> 02:50:53,224
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi.

2836
02:50:54,345 --> 02:50:54,766
[SPEAKER_27]: Nice cock.

2837
02:50:54,826 --> 02:50:56,047
[SPEAKER_16]: You're the best.

2838
02:50:57,608 --> 02:50:57,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

2839
02:50:59,009 --> 02:51:00,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

2840
02:51:00,710 --> 02:51:05,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, speaking of which, oh, we went to get the, oh, Irene, you have the biggest cock here in the room right now.

2841
02:51:08,056 --> 02:51:10,118
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you like to do with your cock?

2842
02:51:10,959 --> 02:51:13,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I mostly like to masturbate.

2843
02:51:13,141 --> 02:51:14,261
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes I like to pee.

2844
02:51:14,442 --> 02:51:15,883
[SPEAKER_03]: With Buck, with Buck Futter?

2845
02:51:16,909 --> 02:51:19,690
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, sure.

2846
02:51:19,910 --> 02:51:22,551
[SPEAKER_03]: The day is mine.

2847
02:51:22,611 --> 02:51:26,012
[SPEAKER_03]: This show went to the toilet about three hours ago.

2848
02:51:26,832 --> 02:51:28,872
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it went about like 40 episodes ago.

2849
02:51:28,932 --> 02:51:31,233
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to ask you about the penis micia.

2850
02:51:32,973 --> 02:51:33,994
[SPEAKER_15]: Anal bum covers.

2851
02:51:38,535 --> 02:51:40,716
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe they should have like DDR Epcot cam.

2852
02:51:43,266 --> 02:51:45,190
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like something you have to get, like a surgery.

2853
02:51:45,230 --> 02:51:48,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know how when you get tested for STDs, they sort of, ah, right in the peel.

2854
02:51:50,641 --> 02:51:53,446
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, some of us haven't had to.

2855
02:51:54,088 --> 02:51:54,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't either.

2856
02:51:54,569 --> 02:51:55,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard stories.

2857
02:51:55,919 --> 02:52:00,380
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was so funny, once I was at In-N-Out, and my mom thought, yeah, that was funny!

2858
02:52:01,660 --> 02:52:02,681
[SPEAKER_05]: In-N-Out cock, get it?

2859
02:52:03,021 --> 02:52:19,425
[SPEAKER_05]: And the person next to us was reading a magazine called Therapist, and the person reading it was obviously some therapist who subscribed to the monthly magazine or whatever, and my mom pointed it out, and she's like, you know that if you put a space between the first three letters, it says The Rapist?

2860
02:52:19,965 --> 02:52:22,666
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's just like, oh my god!

2861
02:52:24,502 --> 02:52:26,844
[SPEAKER_05]: My mom's like, yeah, you'll never look at that word the same again.

2862
02:52:29,306 --> 02:52:31,147
[SPEAKER_16]: Still, you're in those parts.

2863
02:52:32,208 --> 02:52:38,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Nostylan is doing his typical interesting random comments here in the chat room, and he says, who wants to go to DDR camp?

2864
02:52:40,215 --> 02:52:42,116
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell would DDR camp be?

2865
02:52:42,216 --> 02:52:45,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that like a... I don't know.

2866
02:52:45,399 --> 02:52:46,660
[SPEAKER_03]: This one time at DDR camp?

2867
02:52:47,600 --> 02:52:50,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's not... Is that like a camp where they're going to, like, kill us all?

2868
02:52:50,543 --> 02:52:51,744
[SPEAKER_16]: This one time at DDR camp?

2869
02:52:52,544 --> 02:52:52,985
[SPEAKER_16]: I, um...

2870
02:52:53,925 --> 02:52:58,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Who would be the first counselor at DDR camp to try and molest somebody?

2871
02:52:58,607 --> 02:52:58,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

2872
02:52:58,787 --> 02:53:00,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki has his hand up.

2873
02:53:00,128 --> 02:53:01,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have anything to say.

2874
02:53:01,069 --> 02:53:01,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, he was volunteering.

2875
02:53:02,469 --> 02:53:05,571
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, how many DDR players are hard up for dates?

2876
02:53:22,046 --> 02:53:22,406
[SPEAKER_03]: All of them.

2877
02:53:23,047 --> 02:53:23,447
[SPEAKER_16]: Not me.

2878
02:53:23,648 --> 02:53:24,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Only you, not you.

2879
02:53:25,029 --> 02:53:25,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost all of them.

2880
02:53:27,411 --> 02:53:31,214
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I take that back because... All of them that aren't involved with Orange Lounge.

2881
02:53:32,055 --> 02:53:35,658
[SPEAKER_26]: I would say that would go towards any females.

2882
02:53:35,938 --> 02:53:39,761
[SPEAKER_26]: Obviously, I would not want to molest any guys because that's just weird.

2883
02:53:42,484 --> 02:53:44,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but this is hypothetical.

2884
02:53:45,286 --> 02:53:46,607
[SPEAKER_16]: Hypothetical can't hurt me.

2885
02:53:48,129 --> 02:53:49,550
[SPEAKER_16]: Not hypothetical, just pathetic.

2886
02:53:52,665 --> 02:53:54,712
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm hyper-pathetical, okay?

2887
02:53:56,497 --> 02:53:57,400
[SPEAKER_16]: Hyperglycemic?

2888
02:53:58,444 --> 02:53:59,066
[SPEAKER_20]: Telepathetical.

2889
02:54:01,368 --> 02:54:07,831
[SPEAKER_03]: EOSFVB expresses great disappointment that we went through that whole segment about masturbating and didn't bring up lotion.

2890
02:54:08,411 --> 02:54:13,093
[SPEAKER_03]: And then more than Jake says, it puts the lotion on its skin and puts it in the basket.

2891
02:54:13,113 --> 02:54:14,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they didn't really let me finish.

2892
02:54:14,834 --> 02:54:16,834
[SPEAKER_08]: They stole the mic from me before I could finish.

2893
02:54:16,915 --> 02:54:18,935
[SPEAKER_26]: But yeah, lotion would definitely work.

2894
02:54:20,316 --> 02:54:21,837
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, that's pretty good.

2895
02:54:22,117 --> 02:54:24,758
[SPEAKER_08]: It puts the lotion on its skin or it gets the hose again.

2896
02:54:25,140 --> 02:54:26,601
[SPEAKER_03]: How about a dead baby joke?

2897
02:54:26,641 --> 02:54:28,662
[SPEAKER_03]: More than Jake wants us to tell a dead baby joke.

2898
02:54:29,542 --> 02:54:30,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here it is.

2899
02:54:30,263 --> 02:54:32,124
[SPEAKER_16]: How many dead babies does it take to screw in a light bulb?

2900
02:54:32,204 --> 02:54:32,524
[SPEAKER_03]: How many?

2901
02:54:32,944 --> 02:54:33,644
[SPEAKER_16]: None, they're dead.

2902
02:54:36,126 --> 02:54:38,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well there's one, I'm just going to read this one from the chat room.

2903
02:54:38,507 --> 02:54:38,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, I got one.

2904
02:54:38,847 --> 02:54:39,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I got one.

2905
02:54:39,587 --> 02:54:40,648
[SPEAKER_04]: What is a dead baby?

2906
02:54:41,068 --> 02:54:41,288
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2907
02:54:41,789 --> 02:54:42,989
[SPEAKER_04]: A baby that is dead.

2908
02:54:43,870 --> 02:54:44,530
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not funny.

2909
02:54:44,950 --> 02:54:46,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is people laughing?

2910
02:54:46,171 --> 02:54:50,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, more than Jake says, what's the difference between a pile of dead babies and a Corvette?

2911
02:54:50,973 --> 02:54:51,193
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2912
02:54:51,334 --> 02:54:52,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a Corvette in the garage.

2913
02:54:52,754 --> 02:54:53,955
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2914
02:54:54,721 --> 02:54:55,221
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty funny.

2915
02:54:55,501 --> 02:54:55,781
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2916
02:54:56,341 --> 02:55:01,463
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting about to that time where we're going to end the damn show, so we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2917
02:55:01,503 --> 02:55:03,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start with all the guests tonight, starting in the back with Dave.

2918
02:55:04,584 --> 02:55:06,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave, what's your final thought of the day?

2919
02:55:07,565 --> 02:55:08,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Homework sucks.

2920
02:55:09,005 --> 02:55:10,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I have school tomorrow.

2921
02:55:10,566 --> 02:55:11,506
[SPEAKER_05]: That is bullshit.

2922
02:55:12,066 --> 02:55:12,786
[SPEAKER_05]: It's school.

2923
02:55:13,346 --> 02:55:15,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Finals are coming.

2924
02:55:16,147 --> 02:55:18,748
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2925
02:55:18,768 --> 02:55:18,808
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

2926
02:55:24,870 --> 02:55:27,472
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, I don't quite understand the school system over here.

2927
02:55:27,813 --> 02:55:29,714
[SPEAKER_20]: Why would you have finals after a break?

2928
02:55:29,934 --> 02:55:33,217
[SPEAKER_20]: See, back where I come from, we have finals before we go and vegetate.

2929
02:55:33,577 --> 02:55:34,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

2930
02:55:34,378 --> 02:55:34,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, sorry.

2931
02:55:34,898 --> 02:55:39,022
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can forget everything.

2932
02:55:39,442 --> 02:55:41,264
[SPEAKER_20]: Apparently, he's almost gone.

2933
02:55:42,905 --> 02:55:44,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody pass the mic, somebody else.

2934
02:55:45,187 --> 02:55:46,648
[SPEAKER_27]: Brad, what's your final thought of the day?

2935
02:55:46,668 --> 02:55:50,231
[SPEAKER_27]: My final thought is, what do you get when you cross an owl on a bungee cord?

2936
02:55:51,092 --> 02:55:51,933
[SPEAKER_27]: My ass!

2937
02:55:53,959 --> 02:55:57,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you were going to say cunt, fuck, shit, dick, ass, pussy.

2938
02:55:57,763 --> 02:55:58,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

2939
02:55:58,483 --> 02:56:00,125
[SPEAKER_20]: We haven't gotten to the last part of it.

2940
02:56:00,725 --> 02:56:01,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

2941
02:56:01,326 --> 02:56:01,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Stress up.

2942
02:56:02,207 --> 02:56:03,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Your final thought of the day.

2943
02:56:03,448 --> 02:56:07,071
[SPEAKER_20]: First of all, I would like to thank everybody for making this such a wonderful weekend.

2944
02:56:07,091 --> 02:56:09,534
[SPEAKER_20]: You're welcome.

2945
02:56:09,854 --> 02:56:11,315
[SPEAKER_20]: The experience was very fun.

2946
02:56:12,016 --> 02:56:16,180
[SPEAKER_20]: And final thought is... Huh?

2947
02:56:18,590 --> 02:56:19,931
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Angel.

2948
02:56:20,351 --> 02:56:22,312
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to light Loki's hair on fire.

2949
02:56:23,012 --> 02:56:24,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we need to light Loki's hair on fire.

2950
02:56:25,674 --> 02:56:26,734
[SPEAKER_18]: Dress him up as Rage.

2951
02:56:28,475 --> 02:56:28,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie.

2952
02:56:30,376 --> 02:56:32,778
[SPEAKER_16]: Contribute to the DarkSakura Needs New Shoes Fund.

2953
02:56:33,698 --> 02:56:35,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Contribute to the Jamie Needs New Shoes Fund.

2954
02:56:35,379 --> 02:56:38,280
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, people, find me a poppin' music controller.

2955
02:56:39,561 --> 02:56:45,044
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I have one more controller to get before I have one, everyone that's been out.

2956
02:56:45,364 --> 02:56:46,905
[SPEAKER_16]: At least, you know, except for the arcade ones.

2957
02:56:48,700 --> 02:56:49,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Get me one.

2958
02:56:50,041 --> 02:56:50,882
[SPEAKER_16]: Bitches.

2959
02:56:52,263 --> 02:56:52,983
[SPEAKER_16]: No women, no kids.

2960
02:56:54,184 --> 02:56:56,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I was very rude because I cut off Angel before she was done.

2961
02:57:00,249 --> 02:57:01,410
[SPEAKER_18]: Best show ever.

2962
02:57:02,311 --> 02:57:02,871
[SPEAKER_18]: This was fun.

2963
02:57:03,091 --> 02:57:03,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

2964
02:57:04,392 --> 02:57:05,413
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to talk about dick more often.

2965
02:57:05,473 --> 02:57:05,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki!

2966
02:57:06,694 --> 02:57:07,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Your final thought of the day.

2967
02:57:08,576 --> 02:57:12,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know this dick that you're talking about, but he gets too much attention.

2968
02:57:13,139 --> 02:57:17,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, um... Huh.

2969
02:57:17,763 --> 02:57:18,003
[SPEAKER_26]: I had...

2970
02:57:19,619 --> 02:57:21,460
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, my girlfriend's not here, obviously!

2971
02:57:22,420 --> 02:57:22,980
[SPEAKER_26]: Jackass!

2972
02:57:24,221 --> 02:57:31,924
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, so, yeah, um, I should start a fund and see how many people give me money.

2973
02:57:32,785 --> 02:57:33,525
[SPEAKER_26]: That'd be cool.

2974
02:57:34,646 --> 02:57:35,566
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to get money.

2975
02:57:37,107 --> 02:57:44,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Start the Dave Needs to Get Laid Fund, which all money goes towards me to get laid.

2976
02:57:45,010 --> 02:57:45,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2977
02:57:46,131 --> 02:57:48,072
[SPEAKER_17]: For your 18th birthday, we'll take you to the Buddy Ranch.

2978
02:57:50,526 --> 02:57:51,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck that, man.

2979
02:57:51,067 --> 02:57:52,788
[SPEAKER_08]: We could take you to the strip club, okay?

2980
02:57:52,888 --> 02:57:57,652
[SPEAKER_08]: And most of the chicks there give head when you go into the private dances.

2981
02:57:58,033 --> 02:57:58,593
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've heard.

2982
02:57:58,733 --> 02:58:05,259
[SPEAKER_16]: I've never actually had it happen, but... Brad's doing the dancer dance.

2983
02:58:06,340 --> 02:58:07,561
[SPEAKER_16]: No, you have to have a Barbie doll.

2984
02:58:09,242 --> 02:58:09,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Here, use the ferret.

2985
02:58:12,921 --> 02:58:13,221
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2986
02:58:13,661 --> 02:58:14,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you done with your final thought?

2987
02:58:14,802 --> 02:58:14,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2988
02:58:15,262 --> 02:58:16,103
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have a final thought?

2989
02:58:16,843 --> 02:58:17,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

2990
02:58:17,904 --> 02:58:19,385
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought, that's cool.

2991
02:58:19,545 --> 02:58:21,826
[SPEAKER_03]: They got RBGL sucks printed really big in the chat.

2992
02:58:21,986 --> 02:58:22,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2993
02:58:22,226 --> 02:58:22,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Word.

2994
02:58:23,707 --> 02:58:31,232
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is work sucks, Dancer is the best video ever, and, um, yeah.

2995
02:58:32,913 --> 02:58:33,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a date.

2996
02:58:34,213 --> 02:58:36,475
[SPEAKER_27]: Fuck, shit, cock, cunt, slick, dick, suck, suck.

2997
02:58:36,555 --> 02:58:37,735
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, I said slut.

2998
02:58:39,496 --> 02:58:40,057
[SPEAKER_16]: Ha, ha.

2999
02:58:40,597 --> 02:58:41,137
[SPEAKER_16]: Ha, ha.

02:58:41,598 --> 02:58:42,118
[SPEAKER_16]: Give me that.

3001
02:58:42,138 --> 02:58:42,218
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

3002
02:58:44,514 --> 02:58:45,895
[SPEAKER_16]: I can imitate Popolitary.

3003
02:58:50,258 --> 02:58:50,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

02:58:50,759 --> 02:58:53,741
