2416	3277	Message for you, son!
3738	4419	Attention!
5600	9505	Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
11107	16154	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, Mamani Talk, and then some.
19785	22707	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
23027	26209	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
26790	29512	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
30032	32934	Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
33714	34135	Just kidding.
34335	35936	Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
36136	43601	In this episode... Hey, any balls down there?
43861	46343	That's the biggest berry I've ever seen, Jingleberry.
46403	48444	What's your favorite scary movie?
49577	50157	Showgirls.
51038	52258	Absolutely frightful.
52418	53239	What's yours?
53279	55740	There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
55800	57060	Don't torture yourself.
57681	58541	That's my job.
58621	60442	Now's the time our sprockets made me dogs!
60502	63603	I'll get you, my pretty.
63803	65144	And your little dog, too.
65524	66444	I know Kung Fu.
66804	69225	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
69466	71326	Why did they have to take the word gang?
72927	75528	Nobody expects a Spanish exposition.
75848	76669	It's gender.
76729	77249	Hey!
79520	81321	DarkSakura, Shut up!
81521	82181	Where's my gun?
82321	84643	This is my boomstick!
84723	87244	Sky, Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!
87564	91286	Loki, I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.
91346	94107	What kind of warped human being would find that funny?
94388	105073	Orange Lounge Radio We are live and this is episode number 30 for January 9th, I'm sorry, January the 26th of 2003.
107498	112243	You're tuned into the Bimani Scene's most apocalyptic radio station of all things Bimani.
112964	114786	My name is Rob Roberts, or you might know me as Sky.
115647	119711	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.
121473	123095	You know her better as DarkSakura.
124056	125958	She does not sound very enjoyed today, I'm sorry.
126078	126638	No, I'm okay.
127299	128781	Okay, we're having some... And you bring...
129601	131042	We need a mixing board for this damn show.
155938	162121	Okay, anyway, also in the house, say hello to our tech master Loki.
162842	163282	Hey everybody.
164062	164723	How you doing?
166684	167344	Doing good.
167825	174509	We also have special guests in the studio tonight, except they're all in the other room, so fuck them.
174529	175569	They don't exist to me.
176910	177471	Oh, here they come.
178231	178711	Here I come.
178971	180592	Did he just say he sucks on the dick soar?
182073	182974	Hello dick suck soar.
183692	185253	Who are the Dick Suck Swords?
185614	187155	It would not be nice to have a sword here.
187395	189297	Introduce yourselves for the listening audience, please.
190237	192459	Why, I hear everything.
194741	196262	Yeah, you damn slacker.
196342	199665	Oh, thanks, I was going to do it.
199685	202847	Yeah, Brian, aka STMX, whatever you like.
211704	212605	Thank you for watching!
231252	238341	Anyway, we're going to start right off the gate tonight with tonight's list list, and we'll be right back after this break with the list list.
238541	244428	To start off tonight, we're going to play a little song that's really popular in DDR Extreme.
244488	247131	It came over from Poppin' Music, and all you kids love it.
247171	249274	It's called Daiken Kai.
249874	250115	Enjoy.
250135	250315	Enjoy.
260992	263775	High Tension, High Tension, High Tension, High Tension, High Tension
286085	286746	Thank you for watching!
311155	312456	DarkSakura.com
336531	339094	S, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
439462	440468	Thank you for watching!
471759	480349	I'm giving all my heart to you, my love I justify my love for you I'm giving you my heart, my soul, my love I justify my love for you I justify my love for you
517125	526109	And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.
526529	528570	Do it all night, do it with me.
529010	531391	No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible.
531431	532792	Do you take vocal lessons?
532852	533832	Kill your teacher.
534332	535353	In the heat of the night.
535813	538034	Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.
539214	539895	I liked it.
540415	541956	Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.
542056	542496	Next.
544413	546836	Um, that was cool.
548239	550021	Do you even know why you're here?
550121	552305	That was just bloody pathetic, next!
557691	557891	Yes!
558311	558951	Yes, that's it!
559291	560492	We have a winner!
561252	565653	A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.
566033	569914	A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio, because I say that every week.
571454	573015	Anyway, yes, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
573775	575115	And we're having the humming issue tonight.
575155	575935	We apologize.
575995	577136	There's not much we can do about it.
577176	581597	So what we're actually going to try to do is kind of turn down our volumes and kill our in-studio noise.
581917	583997	You guys will have to talk really loud into the mics tonight.
584317	584978	Okay!
585238	585838	Just like that.
585898	586258	Good job.
587762	588462	Can you hear us?
589723	590764	Hi!
591144	594746	So, we apologize for the humming, but my computer just sucks.
595567	596807	I think they like it when you hum.
598809	599309	Anyway, yes.
603231	608875	I dusted off that erotic promo because American Idol 2 premiered this week.
609235	613377	I don't know if anybody out there gives a shit about American Idol anymore, but I watched it.
613397	614578	American Idol makes me shit.
617981	620164	I hate Irene, by the way, ladies and gentlemen.
633843	634904	Yeah, yeah.
635404	636184	Like a virgin?
636204	637505	No, you are a virgin.
637965	641907	No one is going to touch you with a 10-foot pole.
641967	642567	Okay.
643168	651071	My God, it's like, let's get some cracked-out baby, raise him up to be a pop idol, and put him on the show.
651151	651952	Oh, wait, no, he's stupid.
654479	657360	I love this American Idol 2 show because I like crap.
657980	666603	And there's just, there's a lot of really, I don't know, I think I'm sick or something because I love watching Simon tear into these people who can't sing.
666643	667023	You like crap.
667043	667323	Because I can.
667383	668864	I just drink a big crap in the toilet.
669244	669824	Thank you.
669864	670624	Thank you for sharing.
671824	680347	Jamie, Channel Pound Orange Lounge is requesting, our chat room, by the way, if you want to join our website, orangelounge.skie.cx, they're requesting a Hummer.
682548	682928	Beautiful.
686912	688993	You know what we used to do, which is quite funny?
689253	697358	So we had this giant, giant subwoofer at Qzar, and people used to sit on it, and then we used to yell into the mic.
698339	699439	Women liked it, I don't know.
700260	702621	That was done on the Howard Stern movie.
703842	705043	Yeah, been there, done that high.
706023	707824	Anyway, oh yeah, we were looking at the rating books.
708265	708625	Damn you!
710723	711684	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
737938	738819	I'm gonna give it another one, so fuck it
753080	757183	We're going to start off tonight's show with a listless segment, because we usually do it at the end of the show.
757203	767352	But tonight we're going to do it at the beginning of the show, because we want to talk about something that's going on right now, right this very minute, that is preventing our usual amounts of listeners from turning out in droves.
768113	769013	What's going on, Jamie?
770495	773057	Other than you about ready to get whopped with this microphone.
773597	777420	The fucking stupid bull.
777440	778541	What's actually happening is...
781499	783379	They're sucking more ass than they've ever sucked in their life.
783399	789141	The raiders are bending over while... While the securers make the choosers, finally.
789221	790341	In their rectal cavity.
790721	792141	And pirate.
795442	796382	Y'all just jealous.
797842	799783	I wish I could lose by 30 points!
799823	800383	Woo!
800723	805604	I'm sorry, but at this point, the collective asshole of the raiders is the cavernous.
806384	808484	Maybe I should go check out the score, because maybe things turned around.
808644	809365	You know what's funny?
809385	810485	What, by two points, maybe?
812565	816086	I wonder if there's going to be rioting in San Diego tonight when the Raiders lose really badly.
816486	822928	Because, like, I don't know if you guys heard, but the whole town of San Diego was kind of bracing themselves for Raiders fans.
822948	825189	Because San Diego is only about an eight-hour drive from Oakland.
825509	828870	So, you know, a lot of those insane people that like to burn things are going to drive down there.
829910	832751	So... We're going to be hearing all kinds of... Oh, man.
833231	834452	I can't wait to see that.
834472	835312	You know, riot goodness.
835672	838073	They're going to blame it on Al-Qaeda.
838893	840694	It's not Oakland, it's not San Diego.
840974	841774	That's Al-Qaeda.
842094	843915	Al-Qaeda wanted the Raiders to win.
847356	849176	Well, I still stand by my word for it.
849196	850117	It's the stupid bowl.
850137	851877	Although the commercials are pretty funny.
852938	856619	Remember, America, if the Raiders lose, the terrorists win.
858940	860120	See, this is what's going to happen.
860420	862601	This is what's going to happen when the Raiders lose the Super Bowl.
866224	877349	Yeah, it was totally unnecessary.
877529	880490	Anyway, oh yes, our list list, hi.
880910	883431	We're going to be doing a list list tonight.
884492	888393	Top three things, or top thing, because we have one thing.
888673	892155	Top things that we'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl.
903701	904783	I just want you to stop.
907567	908468	Yes, so tonight's list list.
908808	913495	Top three things we'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl, except two of our guests just ran out of studio, so we can't even...
916159	929071	The way a list list works, we all will read our top three choices, and then the fun part, we have to go around the room, and each person will remove one thing from that list.
929872	934196	They came up from 3 to 21 and 34, they're in the fourth quarter.
934536	935597	Oh my gods!
935877	936678	They still have a chance.
936778	937198	Yeah, whatever.
937218	938259	I know none of you care.
939920	940180	Anyway.
940960	941260	Here we go.
942081	942941	Somebody else got lazy.
942981	943882	Anyway, yes, the topic.
944282	946623	Top three things we'd rather be doing than watch the Super Bowl.
950225	954067	Alright, and then the chat room, you guys will get to vote on what ends up being the ultimate list.
954807	956928	If you want to vote, join our chat room now.
957008	962010	Just go to our webpage at orangelounge.skie.cx and...
970561	975527	I'm sorry, Brad's back there talking about... The best thing about the Super Bowl is all the cool commercials.
975848	980314	Because, you know, since so many people are watching TV, they pay millions of dollars to put commercial spots.
981187	986509	They did, well, yeah, sometimes they air, you know, a little later, a little afterwards.
986529	990990	But, anywho, they had the Matrix commercial in there for the two new Matrix movies coming out.
991730	992850	Pretty fucking cool, guys.
993731	994131	I'm excited.
994211	994651	I'm wet.
994831	996451	I'm sure they'll be, I'm sure they're already online.
996611	1000172	In fact, I think somebody in our chat, I think EOSFVB already has a copy of them.
1000232	1003613	Yeah, I'm seeing that movie at least eight times when it comes out.
1003953	1008575	Because that's one thing about the Matrix movies, I can see them over and over and over again, and I'm still entertained every time.
1009515	1011275	It's like Jamie with Harry Potter.
1011715	1012055	Yeah.
1012556	1015396	Except Harry Potter doesn't do fucking martial arts and shit.
1015436	1016936	It's cool.
1017036	1017396	It's cool.
1018016	1018777	That would be cool.
1020217	1021037	Harry Potter!
1022257	1022657	Oh, no.
1022697	1027378	Did you know it was on... I think it's the Smoking Gun or something.
1029738	1036580	They had a drug bust of a shipment of ecstasy pills from... Yes, I did see that with Harry Potter's logo.
1036700	1038440	Yeah, with the big HP on them.
1039827	1041970	All right, anyway, let's start.
1042050	1043031	Let's read off our list.
1043712	1045314	We'll start with Brad.
1046555	1048818	Number three thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl.
1048838	1050440	Good, because I know somebody else is already going to pick this.
1050800	1051521	Playing 2DX.
1051822	1052863	Playing 2DX.
1054104	1054385	Damn.
1055791	1056132	All right.
1057954	1060558	Loki, your number three thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl.
1060638	1065845	Since I really don't give a shit at all, I didn't even make a list, so I'm just going to pull random shit out of my head.
1065945	1066666	All right, go for it.
1066746	1068849	We'll go with number three was shaving a monkey.
1069730	1070772	Shaving a monkey.
1074892	1079094	Ryan, the number three thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?
1079134	1081715	Probably fixing my stupid fucking PS2.

1085296	1085696	Please.
1086557	1088457	Fixing my stupid fucking PS2.
1089658	1090058	Beautiful.
1090778	1096181	My number three thing, I also put playing 2DX, except I put playing 2DX at Scandia.
1096221	1099302	So I'll just change that to go to Scandia.
1102788	1129394	My number three thing Alright, yes, your number three thing, Jamie Is having the rest of my wisdom teeth pulled While I'm awake Having the rest of your wisdom teeth pulled while you're awake I'll be numb, but I refuse to be put to sleep Well, they have to be done anyway But I'm not going to let them put me to sleep I'm going to just tell them to numb the fuck out of my mouth And I don't want an IV Now, if I got an IV, okay, my hand would be blue Do I have a pocket?
1129414	1130534	Yeah, I do have a pocket, I'm asleep
1132486	1132787	Anyway.
1133207	1134769	Brad's amused by the pocket on my sleeve.
1134849	1135209	All right.
1135290	1136171	So far, so good.
1136211	1138433	We've got some beautiful choices here.
1138954	1141797	Brad, number two thing you'd rather be doing than watch the Super Bowl.
1142098	1142919	Winning the lottery.
1143219	1144361	Winning the lottery.
1148038	1149478	I think that goes without saying.
1149538	1149979	Great.
1151079	1152960	I'd rather be winning the lottery than doing this show.
1154620	1158141	Loki, the number two thing you'd rather be doing than watching a Super Bowl.
1158161	1161762	Well, this alludes to later on the show, but watching Ally McFeel.
1166344	1172806	Watching Ally McFeel, and if you want to know what the hell that is all about, then stay tuned after the next break.
1174682	1178887	Alright, Ryan, the number two thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl.
1178947	1188357	It's a bit of a plug, but boy, I'd rather be working at GameStop in Arden Fair Mall where you can reserve all your greatest new games coming out soon, like Legend of Zelda.
1189483	1191605	If you don't reserve them there, I'll kill you.
1192105	1194707	Because my man is just lost.
1195568	1196769	I'm trying to be my bitch forever.
1196789	1198770	If you don't come and reserve things, Dan beats me.
1198790	1199291	Quite often.
1213513	1214814	But it's also entertaining to watch.
1215154	1218557	Number two thing I would rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?
1218938	1219338	Napping.
1220459	1221000	Good call.

1285819	1286640	Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
1286700	1287901	Wait, maybe he's gonna change that.

1297054	1297414	All right.
1298775	1301255	Ryan, your number one thing you'd rather be doing in the Washington Bowl.
1301275	1301475	I got you.
1301535	1301936	I'll be.
1302416	1304456	I'm totally going to win this vote here.
1305017	1307477	Big Black Cock!
1307958	1311539	B-I-G-B-L-A-C-K-C-O-C-K, people!
1311759	1313339	Big Black Cock!
1314620	1315260	That was really gay.
1315280	1316960	So you'd rather be doing a Big Black Cock?
1316980	1317441	That's gay.
1322833	1323094	All right.
1324416	1326959	He just wants it to exist instead of Super Bowl.
1328221	1330785	There shall be a big black cock for the masses.
1331726	1334049	And all shall worship it and be happy.
1334289	1337294	And lo, God was pleased by big black cock.
1340423	1343726	My number one thing that I put was masturbating.
1344206	1347769	And that was not actually a stress of PM to me that I should say that.
1347789	1349050	And I actually already had it written down.
1349090	1349991	Come on, you people know me.
1350411	1351232	I put masturbating.
1351272	1352953	Unfortunately, that's kind of already on the list.
1352993	1356276	So I'll say... The slave waits while the masturbates.
1357537	1358998	Mine was a hot spicy boner.
1359018	1360339	Yours could be mild.
1360379	1361800	No, I think I'm going to change it.
1362160	1366244	I would say rather than the Super Bowl, I would rather get fucked up the ass.
1366264	1366504	What?
1367620	1371983	I think you're infringing on the big black cock.
1374565	1375946	Mine's cool.
1375966	1378508	How about, how about, you know what?
1378528	1380449	Innocent.
1397099	1399821	How about get fucked up the ass by the entire losing team?
1399881	1400501	How about that?
1401102	1403043	Ew, no, then you'll get a disease.
1403964	1404724	No, you're right, never mind.
1404744	1405925	Yeah, the ass raiders.
1408387	1410348	Alright, Jamie, your number one answer.
1410368	1411930	Mine's more innocent.
1412250	1412770	What is yours?
1414852	1416713	Naming ponies on Derby Owners Club.
1416993	1419715	Naming ponies on Derby Owners Club, aww.
1419775	1420716	Like they was evil.
1422532	1425515	But my ponies have the best name, like mmm fajitas and I like tees.
1425535	1426056	And hot man sex.
1441408	1449515	Black Cock Black Cock Alright, so here's the list so far We have You wanna read it?

1476396	1478537	Anyway, let's get to the elimination round.
1478577	1479178	Where's Brad?
1479278	1484581	Brad!
1484681	1485822	Beware, I live.
1486623	1487543	Okay.
1488864	1490786	This has to come off the list.
1490966	1491366	Sorry.
1494420	1495622	One of these has to come off the list.
1503612	1505134	I'm not a big fan of the Big Black Cock.
1505154	1507217	Oh, Big Black Cock!
1508018	1509700	First thing to go from the list.
1511601	1513843	Do not attack him while holding the microphone.
1513983	1516165	Don't pick on Brad, I would have taken it off too.
1517847	1519728	Alright, Brad's taken off Big Black Cock.
1520389	1520869	Loki!
1522491	1523872	One of these has to come off the list.
1526034	1528396	As much of a fan as I am of pain.
1528876	1529577	Wait, no I'm not.
1529757	1532980	So, wisdom teeth pulling while awake has come off the list.
1533020	1534001	It doesn't hurt.
1534281	1534742	Oh, alright.
1538371	1540192	I fell asleep when my listen to was pulled.
1540272	1541914	I'm afraid of the dentist, so there.
1542774	1544375	Ryan, something's got to come off this list.
1550099	1557945	Well, there's no really much other reasons to go to Scandia rather than 2DX and Xtreme, and 2DX is already on the list, so I'm going to remove Go to Scandia.
1559554	1560075	Hey!
1560335	1562238	Alright, fine.
1562438	1563620	I'm going to take off the list.
1563660	1565583	I'm going to take off watching Ally McFeel.
1566144	1570751	As great as that porno is, we haven't even talked about it yet, so there's no way in hell it's going to get a vote anyway.
1571091	1572834	So, it's kind of pointless.
1573860	1577043	Being the token female, I'm going to take off the hot spicy boner.
1577063	1580007	I simply don't have one to know what the experience is like.
1580747	1585693	I'd just like to point out that through all the guys in this room, getting fucked up the ass remained on the list.
1587094	1589436	So, like I said, it's not a gay thing.
1590137	1595142	It's just funny sounding, and we'll get votes, and we want to win because it's funny.
1595843	1596303	Random.
1596743	1596963	Yeah.
1597363	1597703	Alright.
1599464	1608326	So, these are your choices, and you can send me your votes right now in private message in the chat room, or you can send them over email to orangelaunchradio at yahoo.com, but you better do it now.
1608446	1613327	Jamie, tell us, what are the things that they can vote on that they'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?
1613347	1617828	Playing 2DX, shaving a monkey, fixing Ryan's stupid fucking PS2.

1632999	1640263	So we're going to take a quick break, and we'll be right back to reveal your list of things you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl.
1640283	1642504	You should put something that is truly ass-worthy.
1642524	1643564	Something that is truly ass-worthy.
1643845	1645645	I think I might have a twin remix on here.
1645685	1646526	I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.
1647307	1649729	You have to play the gayest song in all of Imani.
1649909	1650489	Okay, what's that?
1650969	1651390	Dynamite.
1652370	1652851	Ah, okay.

1654832	1655712	Guitar Freaks.
1655732	1656253	Guitar Freaks.
1656273	1657333	Ooh, I don't even know if I have that.
1657774	1658454	I don't think I have it.
1658514	1661236	You should do it because I gave it to you.
1661756	1662597	Okay, what?
1662877	1663317	What's on here?
1663577	1664658	I don't know.
1664798	1668681	I'll look for Dynamite, but it's probably on one of your pre-show discs, huh?
1669021	1670442	No, I actually gave it to you.
1670522	1672243	I've got to find it.
1672283	1673704	I don't know if I copied it to my drive.
1673724	1674064	Do it.
1678487	1679328	Last week's free show.
1681108	1683829	Put this in and we'll find a song to play for you lovely people.
1689011	1692512	So, we're going to play... Big Black Cock.
1695513	1698294	Loading, loading, loading, loading away.
1699175	1700535	Did my wind amp freeze?
1700795	1702236	That would really suck.
1703016	1703456	No, it didn't.
1703476	1703656	Good.
1703876	1704096	Okay.
1704657	1705297	Okay, what do we hear?
1705597	1705657	Uh...
1709952	1711832	Bitches is cool, but it's not crappy.
1711972	1713533	I didn't put any crappy shit on here.
1713573	1715093	How about this Upside Down remix?
1715133	1717214	That's the Eurobeat version of Upside Down.
1717234	1718754	That'll be pretty gay, we'll hear that.
1719694	1724656	Alright, we'll be right back to reveal the top list of things we'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl.
1724676	1724936	Here we go.

2003107	2008911	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
2015393	2015993	You know what?
2016834	2020775	That end of Secret Rendezvous sounds like she's having diarrhea.
2021636	2023517	Or really constipated or something.
2023577	2027178	Let me play that one more time for you so you can hear it here.
2031880	2033561	Yeah, she's constipated.
2034061	2035602	She needs some X-Lax.
2035742	2037463	They make it chocolate coated and it's yummy.
2039036	2040477	Okay.
2040777	2041137	Fair enough.
2041217	2041957	Alright, here it is.
2042017	2046118	The top three things is voted by you folks in the chat room.
2046518	2048999	Things you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl.
2049139	2055782	Number three winner is... No, Jacking My Hotspice Voter was taken off the list.
2055822	2056442	I'm sorry.
2056922	2058943	Winning the lottery was your number three pick.
2059823	2060503	Did you win yet?
2061423	2062264	I won a ticket.
2062804	2063224	Alright.
2064238	2070946	Your number two pick for things you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl is... Buying more Propel and drinking it.
2071006	2071507	Yay!
2071607	2073049	Buying more Propel and drinking it.
2074090	2074911	And an honor of Propel.
2080892	2106168	Alright, and the number one thing y'all would rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl is Playing 2DX Playing 2DX, so there you have it I'm really disappointed that getting fucked up the ass and getting laid and all the sexual stuff was loose I'm starting to think your audience is a bunch of fucking weirdos If they think that winning the lottery is not as good as these other things
2106728	2108749	Okay, if you win the lottery, you can buy sex.
2108949	2111510	Winning the lottery should be up there at the top.
2112110	2115412	Yeah, but after winning the lottery, you can buy Propel and drink it, too.
2115432	2118353	You can buy, like, vast amounts of Propel.
2119073	2121274	If you won the lottery, you could get all of those things.
2122234	2123095	And my spicy boner.
2123975	2125256	And you could buy a CDX machine.
2125696	2127036	Or lots of tokens.
2127457	2128917	You could probably buy Scandi.
2129878	2130618	There you go, buy Scandi.
2131377	2133778	Don't worry, Keaton, if we buy Scandia, we'll still keep your job.
2133838	2135299	Yeah, you can stay employed at Scandia.
2135379	2141881	Anyway, actually, what I think we should do is buy Golfland, fire all the management, and then have the Scandia... And then turn it into a strip club!
2142561	2143642	Yee-haw!
2144702	2145322	Yeah!
2146423	2149344	No, we turn half of it into a strip club and the other half into a better arcade.
2149504	2150704	Yeah, where they would have Upskirt DDR.
2150744	2151585	And have a naked water park.
2151625	2152345	Upskirt DDR.
2152405	2153125	Upskirt DDR.
2153785	2155746	I like the idea of an all-nude water park.
2155766	2157547	Let's just turn Golfland into a nudist colony.
2159827	2160107	Wait!
2160728	2167515	Nudist colony with one little thing, and it's gotta be, you know, like they have, you know, welcomes, all sorts of life, da-da-da-da-da, star.
2168016	2169417	No ugly people!
2169858	2176405	This includes you fat people, and you over 40 people, and you that apply to both of those.
2177306	2180069	No ugly people allowed.
2181210	2181611	Period.
2182711	2184235	They have a pre-screening for this.
2185178	2186300	You have to like pass the test.
2186421	2188085	Yes, and Jamie and I are the pre-screeners.
2188385	2189548	Well, here's the thing.
2189588	2190130	Here's the thing.
2191608	2193629	No, no, no, no, yes!
2194649	2195790	It's going to have a few tests.
2196050	2198030	First, it's going to be a slightly small doorway.
2198310	2201211	If you can't fit through the doorway, you're not allowed to go in there first off.
2201612	2206914	Number two, it's going to have maybe some sort of small animal, like a monkey or something.
2207094	2208934	You scare the monkey, you don't come in.
2212215	2213436	No, no, I'll just bring Shermie.
2216077	2217658	If Shermie doesn't like you, leave.
2217859	2218399	Exactly.
2219219	2224103	If she doesn't roll over and show you her belly, then you suck.
2224263	2226724	If she doesn't wave her genitalia at you, then there's something wrong.
2228726	2232548	No smelly people either, because there's some smelly people that go to Golfland to play guitar freaks.
2233529	2237752	One of them better be listening right now, because I'm going to tell you right now, fucking wash your ass.
2237772	2240013	No sweaty balls and no unwashed twat.
2240233	2240974	Sweaty balls.
2241694	2242715	Sweaty balls and unwashed twat.
2243726	2246549	Hey, Ryan, come talk to us about your unwashed twat.
2248031	2249733	Do you have an unwashed twat, Ryan?
2249893	2251415	Has feminine odor and itching got you down?
2253237	2254558	Are you feeling not so fresh?
2256460	2257421	Try Vagisil.
2257622	2261786	Why don't you check on Vagiclean?
2262247	2265150	It's so hard when you just walk into a room and you're getting...
2267336	2268136	I hate you all.
2272098	2272939	I hate you all.
2277821	2280222	Meatballs and douche, yes, meatballs and douche.
2280883	2281743	Now, wait a minute.
2282143	2283164	Now, hold on, hold on.
2283424	2284425	Hold up for a minute here.
2285045	2290928	Mabel's in the chat room and he's crying because he's claiming that he's fat and ugly and if he was over 40 he wouldn't be able to get in.
2291792	2293012	You were neither.
2293833	2295013	No, you're not fat or ugly.
2295053	2296314	You can come to our nudist colony.
2296334	2297714	So quit whining.
2299735	2301456	Wait, there's a second rule to this.
2301536	2303096	It's called the pimp factor, okay?
2303336	2309019	You can look like whatever you want, but as long as you bring at least fine, really fine honeys in, you're okay.
2309519	2309879	Bring me...
2310683	2316586	We need to have a room, though, with, like, really, really pretty men going at it so I can watch them.
2317366	2317886	Wait a minute, though.
2317926	2318326	No one under 18.
2318967	2319207	Sorry.
2319807	2320227	No one under 18.
2320868	2321348	Yeah, sorry.
2321388	2322028	We just can't have that.
2322208	2322708	Sorry, guys.
2322748	2323809	But I need the happy room.
2324889	2328751	We do like all our under 18 fans, you know, because we know we have a lot of under 18 people listening.
2328931	2329591	We can't get in trouble.
2329631	2330512	Sorry, guys.
2330812	2331792	I want the happy room, though.
2332272	2333393	I have to have the happy room.
2333533	2334954	They just have to sell it.
2335014	2336175	And then I can videotape it and sell it.
2336655	2339358	It could be like, you know, it could be like Beavis and Butthead.
2339658	2342420	You must be over 18 to be able to shoot skeet.
2342780	2343501	Are you guys over 18?
2343641	2345763	Uh, no.
2346623	2347664	Are you guys over 18?
2348945	2349205	Yes.
2349465	2351767	Okay, you can just, see, there you go.
2351967	2353208	Okay, okay, that'll work.
2353248	2353649	That'll work.
2353789	2354189	That's fine.
2355530	2357471	If you say you're under 18, you can't get in.
2357491	2361954	But if you say you're over 18, then, you know, hey, we were only going off what you said, so.
2362935	2363936	I want the happy room.
2366617	2368879	You know, we could actually just turn it into a porn studio.
2370440	2372801	And then we would, like, pay for everything that way.
2373242	2375323	Because porn's really cheap to make.
2375663	2379566	All you need is a video camera and, like, one of those handheld spotlights.
2381089	2382029	You don't even need a script.
2382490	2385451	Say, hey you, fuck, and then make something up.
2386632	2390053	Speaking of pornography, thank you for that lovely transition.
2390333	2391134	How was your week?
2392214	2392855	Pornerific.
2393195	2393895	Pornerific.
2394275	2395116	How was your week looking?
2397165	2397745	and many more.
2418699	2437425	Um, no, I was trying to, uh, yet again trying to crack the, uh, DDR Extreme disc, and, uh, so, in which case, I was, um, you know, I thought for some reason, actually, I figured out where everything is on the disc, and, um, what the fuck is so funny?
2439386	2441487	It's not you, sorry, I just showed Jamie something I typed.
2441507	2442647	Who is touching Jamie in there?
2444008	2444548	Stop it!
2445508	2447309	I was having a laugh at somebody's expense.
2449525	2450586	No, no, we'll tell you guys during the video.
2450606	2451287	Alright, okay.
2451968	2455492	So anyways, I was... This is very distracting, you guys.
2456293	2456854	Sorry.
2458696	2461359	So, I was trying to install Linux on my computer.
2462020	2467326	I borrowed a couple copies of Linux from our friend Keith, and I was installing them on my computer.
2467406	2467626	Well...
2468547	2471050	You know, the damn thing didn't want to install for some reason.
2471070	2485808	The installation program thought it knew how to partition my drives better than I did, and so it was a pain in the ass for about three days, and then finally I went out, bought Linux, installed it, everything's fine, but now I can't do what I wanted it to do in the first place, which was...
2487450	2489453	I've got, okay, basically here's the situation.
2489573	2493459	I've got on the arcade disc for DDR Extreme, there's a bunch of files on there.
2493519	2497404	Now, they're images of actual, um, of the flashcards that it flashes.
2497424	2502431	So it basically copies this image to the flashcard, but in the images themselves are actually file trees.
2502791	2503431	Thanks for watching!
2524574	2525475	So that was my week.
2526355	2526916	Exciting.
2527536	2528196	No, it's not.
2529397	2530018	You're right, it's not.
2530378	2532559	Anyway, I'm just kidding.
2532679	2533620	My week was pretty good.
2535181	2538103	I napped a lot, and I went out and did stuff.
2538283	2538983	You know, stuff.
2539964	2540925	I volunteered to be a prop.
2566513	2567614	I volunteered to be a prop.
2567934	2569314	Yes, and Jamie's on the cast too.
2569394	2575197	So we were here participating in the Rocky Horror rehearsal last night.
2575357	2578938	And somebody brought to cast rehearsal for Irene some pornography.
2579298	2580839	Some fine pornography.
2581439	2583340	And there was this porno called Ally McFeel.
2587102	2589783	And Irene was a dumb bitch, of course, and left it here.
2589803	2591403	I'm just kidding.
2591483	2592344	Hey.
2593724	2594965	I'm a woman like that.
2596605	2618247	and uh so and uh so what happened last night we were bored and we went out to dinner we went out to lions and after we came back from lions jamie and i were bored so we decided we'd watch this porno holly mcfeel and it's great it's fucking great and we wanted to play a clip from it for you guys because basically the way it is it's set up
2618787	2619268	DarkSakura.com
2634484	2640848	And basically, just like on the real show, Ally McBeal, when they go to the law firm, all the lawyers and everybody, they're all fucking each other, basically.
2641569	2644330	And so, then we have the big trial.
2644370	2645531	The big trial comes later.
2645911	2649113	And we wanted to play a clip from the trial for you guys.
2649133	2654497	And we have Johnny Cockring, who is... I have to giggle.
2655057	2656338	She gave him her panties and...
2657003	2660447	Yes, we have Johnny Cockering, and Ally McFeel gave Johnny Cockering her panties.
2660567	2662009	He sniffed them and put them in his jacket.
2662029	2663611	Yeah, and he sniffed them and put them in his jacket.
2663931	2668257	And he's basically the lawyer supporting the woman who had the dildo explode inside of her.
2669478	2674765	Yes, and Ally McFeel, her client is the company that made the exploding dildo.
2675205	2676666	Who, by the way, fucks the other person.
2677346	2680088	Yeah, who, by the way, fucks the chick with the cavernous pussy in the beginning.
2680108	2681449	To see if she knows how to use the dildo.
2681469	2683430	Yeah, to see if she really knows how to use the dildo.
2683570	2685511	You know, kind of an instruction manual.
2685751	2691355	So, anyway, we're going to play a clip from this fabulous porno, which, by the way, also guest stars Ron Jeremy.
2692115	2692635	That was cool.
2692655	2693116	That was humongous.
2693136	2695957	Because I've never seen a real porno with Ron Jeremy in it.
2696738	2700240	I'm sorry, but that was, like, it was big.
2702901	2704242	Yeah, that's why he's popular.
2704623	2706464	He's ugly as hell, but he's got a fucking cute face.
2706924	2711207	Oh my god, he's repulsive in every way, but except his big, velvet chalk.
2712468	2717012	Anyway, we're going to play a clip right now from the big trial for you guys.
2717052	2717452	Here we go.
2717472	2719313	Okay, by the way, nudist colony people?
2720274	2720654	I'm sorry.
2720935	2721475	Yeah, go ahead.
2721835	2726539	For all the nudist colony wannabes, by the way, if you're butt ugly, it's okay if you have a big dick.
2726559	2726919	Okay.
2729568	2731888	That is big.
2731908	2732629	12 inches or more.
2733209	2734569	Holy shit, I'm in.
2734989	2735129	Ow.
2735189	2738390	Okay, but you have to wear a mask and shave your body hair.
2738730	2739210	Here we go.
2739770	2740110	Here we go.
2740170	2743731	Here's a clip from Ally McFeel here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2743751	2749632	And if you like Ally McFeel, since I don't want to get sued by the people who made this, go out and buy it right now.
2750292	2751692	It's a wonderful porno.
2751732	2752612	Two thumbs up.
2752692	2753072	Way up.
2753892	2754773	All right, here we go.
2754793	2755993	Remember, the audience is horny.
2762518	2763438	Oh, it's not coming through.
2763498	2764379	Hold on, just one moment.
2764499	2765579	We have an issue.
2766599	2767539	Hold on one second.
2768760	2771060	I have, I put it in the wrong hole, sorry.
2774902	2775802	Let's try this again.
2778503	2783184	This offending instrument was manufactured by Mr. Boner's company.
2784199	2785000	Objection!
2785560	2787541	My client's name is Bone Herb.
2788122	2792425	As in Christ, I'd like to bone her tight little asshole with my big black cock.
2792445	2794666	Miss MacPhil, you're walking a tight line here.
2796948	2800490	Counsel will not refer to defendant as boner.
2801631	2807295	Mr. Bone Herb's company negligently manufactured this defective dildo.
2807555	2809877	It will apparently damage my client's genitalia.
2810337	2811978	Emotional and physical harm has set in.
2812658	2813039	Chicken...
2814580	2817321	Chocus Pocus is next.
2818761	2821221	Just I ask you, do the right thing.
2821701	2824782	If the dildos is not fit, then they are not legit.
2827443	2828903	Big black cock.
2829183	2834644	We were just really excited and Jamie and I started wetting our pants when she said big black cock.
2837305	2843826	The little gears started turning in Rob's head as he thought, how am I going to... If the dildos is not fit, they are not legit.
2845233	2846514	What is that bullshit?
2847995	2849716	Uh, Maple missed it, so we have to play it again.
2849776	2850236	Sorry, guys.
2850296	2850716	Here we go.
2850836	2852477	Hold on, one more time.
2852757	2853378	Instant replay.
2854378	2855799	Oops, sorry.
2855839	2856780	Let me get back here.
2857280	2860322	It should be part of a new promo.
2860382	2860862	Alright, here we go.
2860882	2861382	Here we go.
2861402	2861562	Miss...
2877203	2878083	Big black cock.
2878283	2879564	And you know the judge looks like The Rock.
2880084	2882284	Yes, the judge looks just like The Rock.
2882304	2883484	With like little twisty spikes.
2884305	2886265	Yeah, he said it was like a nerdy version of The Rock.
2886285	2886805	Dude, he was hot.
2887405	2892206	This is actually one of the few straight porns that actually had good looking guys in it.
2892766	2895027	Yes, it actually had attractive males in this porn.
2895047	2895687	Except for Ron Jeremy.
2895707	2896487	That was psycho.
2896507	2897407	Yeah, except for Ron Jeremy.
2897427	2899188	But he has a big dick, so it's okay.
2899228	2900928	Big dick, you know, made up for it all.
2904292	2905333	Oh, dear good lord.
2936097	2938239	Yeah.
2938279	2939561	I thought that scene was funny, though.
2939581	2942064	The one chick gets her teeth knocked out and he's all, ooh, a gummer.
2942364	2946428	And then later on she gets her teeth back again, like, ooh, what happened there?
2947109	2950833	This porno gets Orange Lounge's highest recommendation, by the way.
2950873	2951654	Two dicks up, way up.
2951674	2952295	I want to see that other
2953579	2956060	Upskirt Cam Pantsless Cam Crossdress or Upskirt Cam Military Kilt Cam
2980157	2984741	There's nothing as enjoyable as kilts worn the traditional way on a breezy day.
2986743	2987383	You're a pervert.
2988364	2991707	You know, that's really gotten me wondering about a lot of my townsfolk.
2991767	2993409	I got, you know, Bob the Cat.
2993789	2995650	He's wearing like a skirt throughout my town.
2995690	2997512	I'm like, what the fuck's going on, Bob?
2997832	2998913	Bob, you're a guy.
2998953	3001816	You're supposed to be wearing guy clothes, not a skirt.
3002955	3008677	There's this rhino in our town named Spike who has a band-aid on his face and he's all hardcore.
3008897	3009977	He was wearing this skull shirt.
3010477	3016339	And then one day he started wearing a blue muumuu with daisies on it.
3016359	3018079	Your town makes people gay, remember?
3018339	3022780	Yes, my town makes animals individual gay.
3023061	3024421	My town is da gay.
3025401	3031023	Well, you know there's the triangle with Dina and Goldie and then Goldie left her for Barbara.
3031363	3031703	Oh my.
3032677	3040280	Well, no, because we thought that Goldie was getting the twat action from Dina, you know, because Dina has that big long bill.
3041421	3048304	And then, because she was saying sugar bill, like Dina says, and then all of a sudden she started saying, I suck, like Barbara says, because we hate Barbara, and she says, I suck.
3048564	3049805	Scan list, scan list.
3049865	3054547	I think I'm just going to change what Horned Thief, I tell, says, though, to my master again.
3055194	3058516	I have one in my town, Cody, he says you ass after everything.
3058536	3059717	So he goes, what's going on you ass?
3059797	3063940	I've got my, I've got, what was it, Ricky the squirrel or whatever.
3063960	3066101	Oh, that little asshole that moved from my village.
3066121	3069723	I changed his thing to say skanky ho after everything he says.
3071304	3072185	My girlfriend loves it.
3073225	3074126	Does she enjoy my letter?
3075087	3077308	She's like, why do you send me stuff?
3078629	3080010	I had some... Was she freaked out?
3080150	3082711	All the townsfolk don't understand anything I write them.
3083132	3083372	And like...
3083905	3086746	The way, okay, I'm going to give you a big tip on Animal Crossing, everybody.
3086766	3088187	This is one of my letters.
3088287	3092589	If you want to get things from the villagers, write a full letter.
3092629	3095290	You've got to write like six lines of letter to your villagers.
3095330	3096631	Do it in a way.
3096651	3097111	Yeah, it works.
3097231	3097631	All the time.
3097711	3100472	All I do is, Dear so-and-so, you suck.
3100553	3102093	I want you to die and go to hell.
3102613	3105215	I hate your guts and I wish that you never moved to my village.
3105555	3106215	Love, Sakura.
3106735	3107616	And I get stuff from them.
3108516	3111679	See, I wrote one to Cody that said, All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.
3111759	3113220	All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.
3113300	3114741	All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.
3114761	3116122	All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.
3116462	3117243	And he sent me furniture.
3118844	3120145	That's great.
3120285	3121526	I got a letter from Goose today.
3121566	3124829	She's like, I was outside shaking trees, and a furniture fell on my head.
3124849	3126030	And that was it.
3126130	3127491	I was like, why are you sending me shit?
3128632	3130794	I don't even want to talk to you, dumb bitch.
3131294	3132335	I like when they're giving you tips.
3132515	3133756	Do you know how to catch fish yet?
3134256	3136178	Well, I just gave you a fish, you jackass.
3136218	3137439	Where do you think I got it from?
3138834	3140855	We want to be slapped in the head by a wet trout.
3140915	3142456	By the way, we can just slap somebody in the chatroom.
3142476	3144357	You want to slap people in the chatroom with wet trouts?
3144437	3145198	Okay, go for it.
3145318	3146518	Well, you've got to click on their name first.
3147059	3148019	Then you slap them.
3148099	3148620	There you go.
3148640	3149940	There you go.
3150040	3152222	You just slapped 23rd Magus with a large trout.
3152682	3153142	How was that?
3153162	3153783	I'm going to slap somebody else.
3153803	3154263	Did you enjoy that?
3154283	3155344	You're going to slap somebody else?
3157445	3158065	Alright!
3161667	3162888	Why are you slapping myself?
3166059	3168882	So, Jamie's having fun slapping people with trouts.
3172667	3173327	I'm sorry, hold on.
3173768	3174228	Ryan, yes.
3174268	3175209	Yeah, Ryan pointed out something.
3175270	3178233	It says in God we trust in the thing, but it should say in God we thrust.
3179534	3180135	Hey, you know what?
3180155	3181657	There's scenes in here that never happened.
3183467	3184608	These are just like promo pictures.
3209016	3210901	Yeah.
3211362	3212245	Anyways.
3212606	3215674	So Jamie's having fun slapping people in the chat room with, uh, trouts.
3220537	3223078	Oh, I saw something funny on Saturday.
3223739	3231824	Okay, so I was outside after playing a vigorous game of DDR Extreme, and I was tired, you know, airing out my shoes and whatnot, and I'm watching the batting cages.
3232445	3242752	And stupid kid number one, and I love it when stupid people get punished, stupid kid number one decides, I'm going to go bat in the batting cage, and his father's watching him and stuff.
3243152	3246615	Well, stupid fat chubby kid number one decides to try to hit the ball.
3246935	3249917	Misses the ball, and so it hits the back whole thing there.
3250237	3253399	So stupid kid number one goes, I'm going to pick up the ball and hit it!
3253800	3256702	So he picks up the ball, stands back up, thwap!
3256742	3259143	In the back of his head with a 50 mile an hour softball.
3259364	3260905	And the stupid kid falls in ground.
3261445	3264387	Started busting up.
3265028	3267629	You didn't look at the pictures on this board.
3267649	3268970	I want to see the pictures.
3270535	3273758	Let's see, uh, he looks like he's having fun.
3275159	3277922	Uh, she's looking like she's having some fun.
3278422	3279783	She's sucking cock.
3281305	3285328	Um, getting done, sucking more cock.
3286249	3286589	Yeah.
3288171	3289051	Ally McFeel.
3289171	3291494	We've started an outbreak of slapping in the chatroom.
3291514	3293896	Ah, it's all purple.
3295297	3296358	Okay, back to Bimani.

3329918	3330278	Well, let's see.
3330298	3335739	What we're going to be playing on the break here is going to be two remix songs from Club Mix, actually.
3335759	3340881	We've got Jam Jam Reggae, and we also have... Ska Go Go, right?
3340901	3341841	Ska Go Go, yes.
3342201	3348463	And these are both... The first one is Jam Jam Reggae, the Jam Jam remix by Good Cool.
3348863	3351364	And the second one is actually remixed by the same group.
3352644	3355585	Or it's actually arranged by Ken Matsu... I don't know.
3356565	3356865	Matsumoto
3453921	3454969	Let's rock tomorrow.
3489429	3497886	And will you ever be the best of friends You shout something you don't win You shout something you don't win
3536014	3537915	Come on baby Let's dream a dream together A dream
3637261	3642403	Listen to Orange Dogs Radio, where you can witness Rob being fucked up the ass by Brad.
3642783	3644064	Brad did a good job.
3644284	3648545	All that Rob's asshole is quite large by now, like a mason jar.
3649566	3654167	You could hold strawberry preserves in Rob's rectum now, and have it tightly sealed.
3656828	3657388	Yeah.
3658409	3659669	Oh, baby, I have the hugest...
3665632	3668015	Hey, it's not my fault all the boys and girls love me.
3668215	3668835	Does Irene know?
3672239	3673780	Well, Irene was sitting on my lap.
3675843	3676063	Anyway.
3677725	3679466	Oh yes, shall we do the FUs of the week now?
3680327	3682069	Would that be like an extension cord?
3684552	3685392	Blink, blink, blink.
3686373	3686654	Alright.
3688725	3692486	If you have an FU of the week, you can send those over a private message or email.
3692766	3693726	I want TerraMix today.
3694346	3695246	You want TerraMix today?
3695266	3695767	TerraMix.
3695907	3697187	Picky, picky, picky.
3698167	3699707	Picky, picky, picky.
3700808	3701188	Gross.
3702128	3702948	That was a chocolate burp.
3703068	3704128	Alright, let's have at it.
3704148	3707649	This burp was brought to you by Russell Stover Chocolate Truffles.
3708669	3709029	Beautiful.
3709449	3710830	Dude, you look like you're trying to deep throat me.
3710850	3711470	This is fucked up.
3718812	3721453	So a sound clip for a future episode.
3749758	3751338	Gentlemen, DarkSakura has a dick.
3752119	3753319	I do not.
3756640	3758360	That's the next intro right there.
3758460	3759561	I have a dick.
3759821	3761701	The next fuck you goes to Rob.
3762121	3762762	And Brad.
3763062	3763602	And Dan.
3763782	3764082	And Dan.
3764102	3764782	This is KTMI.
3764882	3765622	No, I'm sorry.
3777210	3784637	And my other fuck you to me goes toward America for being stupid.
3785318	3790483	Okay, what about American football has to do with using your feet but taking the ball?
3790503	3794507	It happens like for what, one occurrence in the whole game?
3795708	3798711	The whole having to run around and everything might have to do with being stupid.
3799766	3800827	Don't kick the ball.
3801088	3806557	That's why soccer should be football like it is everywhere else in the goddamn world.
3806897	3808019	It's not called kickball.
3813376	3816298	But here's the thing, here's the thing though, I want to say.
3816338	3819341	The thing is that America doesn't give a shit about soccer.
3819841	3825805	Soccer is not important in America.
3826026	3831950	And by the way, American football is a rip-off of rugby, which is a much cooler, violent, bloodier sport.
3832390	3833191	Because you know what?
3833571	3836313	There's something about, okay, first of all, there's the guys that play it.
3836934	3841938	A lot of them are really nicely built, and I don't look like they've been swallowing steroids since they were two years old.
3842990	3848153	They don't have necks with the circumference of a watermelon, okay?
3849154	3853856	They look like normal guys, and they're muscular, and they have this nice butt.
3854617	3856358	And then they get all bloody, which is even better.
3857418	3858439	Because Jimmy's got a dick.
3866884	3871927	Mabel would like to add that soccer is only cool if you're playing Virtua Striker at MGL with another friend.
3872695	3873515	Um, no.
3875016	3877577	Although, and you know, it was really awesome.
3877757	3879757	They even made it into one.
3879857	3886499	I don't think there was a lot of times where they had to thank me and thank him all the time and Aristotle got to come in and work.
3886559	3888040	Um, who needs to get fucked?
3888080	3888380	I'm sorry.
3888400	3889840	What else is there to think about?
3889921	3893422	Not necessarily who needs to get fucked, but what needs to get fucked here.
3893482	3893522	Um...
3901491	3913480	Oh yeah, um, fuck me not having a way to get to Hayward next weekend, because Dan doesn't want me to drive my car to Hayward because I just got it.
3914020	3921906	Um, I would also like to say that my CD player is working, so I would charge my CD for the week, you know.
3921926	3924007	Um, what was the one that I was talking about?
3924027	3924127	No.
3924187	3924508	Um, Walthland?
3931008	3932650	Um, I don't go there anymore.
3934591	3935612	If your brain could.
3935993	3939796	That's the first question.
3939896	3946702	Um, I would like to say thank you to my lack of man sex.
3947003	3947343	Brain.
3948824	3949845	I don't have any man sex.
3950025	3953969	You were asking for my brain earlier.
3954189	3955090	And I need more doujinshi.
3956610	3958691	Alright, Matt, give us your Abuse of the Week.
3970030	3974171	Um, let's see, the first FU goes to Linux!
3975171	3977311	Fuck you Linux, you stupid installer!
3977912	3981572	Work right for once, goddammit, you're free, you should be working!
3982392	3995175	I'll see here, I installed three versions of Linux this weekend, 7.1 decided, gee, I don't feel like I'm gonna install at all, because I'm gonna tell you that your blank 20 gig hard drive has not enough space for me to install my stupid program.
3996275	4002960	So, then I tried installing Red Hat 7.0, got that working, and it's a Japanese copy!
4003060	4005181	I can't read Japanese, so that's not going to do me any good.
4005761	4011185	And then, finally, I installed Mandrake 6.4, and, well, you know what?
4011225	4013186	That program's so old, it doesn't run Jack.
4013307	4019591	It doesn't understand what my monitor is, it doesn't even know what my video card is, so that didn't do me any good, like installing Windows 3.0.
4026516	4029419	Stupid bootloader that puts in there instead of the Windows bootloader.
4029980	4034265	It causes the program to make my Windows kind of glitch out a little bit every now and then.
4034305	4037448	So that sucks because I have to reinstall Windows and that all makes sense.
4038835	4042756	Okay, other than that, F you to the DMV.
4043256	4044136	Why the DMV?
4044196	4049718	Because I can't attack the stupid drivers anymore because you're still stupid and nothing's going to ever help you.
4050198	4054759	So I'm going to yell at the DMV for letting you stupid drivers get on the roads in the first place.
4055019	4056079	You're fucking stupid.
4056399	4060300	Actually, you know, let people take the test and fail the test numerous times.
4060380	4063821	Say, well, I tried to start by putting them on the roads.
4065023	4065704	I hate you!
4066004	4066864	You're stupid!
4067265	4069266	You're part of the government, which makes you worse!
4069506	4071748	Because the government sucks!
4071808	4073909	Can I expand on that?
4073929	4076070	Go ahead.
4076151	4076411	Yes.
4077712	4081434	This also, you know, NFBs to old people.
4081454	4084016	Because, you know what?
4084756	4089820	I think after a certain age, you outlive your usefulness, and you should be put down.
4089880	4092541	There are some people who've been in the green room.
4094463	4099467	I hate to see now old people, okay?
4100267	4101128	They're stupid.
4101889	4102369	I hate them.
4103270	4106953	Uh, actually, also, F you for, uh, reality TV shows.
4107653	4109054	Hey, I love reality TV.
4109074	4112057	Stop popping up like freaking, I don't know what, dammit.
4112377	4113538	It's like the fucking plague.
4113838	4114919	It's like a, it's like a TV.
4114979	4116060	Guess what, we're gonna watch people's
4117244	4117984	Keep themselves in the head!
4118185	4119945	Guess what, we're gonna watch Brides get mad!
4120066	4124148	I agree, you know what, that Bridezilla, Man vs. Beast, all that shit, completely useless.
4124188	4125869	But surreal life, best show ever.
4126629	4129791	But that Bridezilla thing is the reason why I want it alone.
4130071	4137515	Okay, um, I did find it funny though that they had, uh, 100 Mitch, or like 50 Mitch's pull a jet and had him against the elephant.
4137595	4139596	Because Mitch pulling anything is funny.
4140937	4141797	Uh, but yeah.
4141957	4142818	So you watched it!
4143378	4144619	No, I saw the commercial.
4144999	4145099	Oh.
4146488	4148329	I WATCHED THE COMMERCIAL!
4148969	4149609	Yeah!
4149849	4157092	Anyway, so, um, also, another FU to Crowded Arcade, because I don't like coin lines that are 16 coins long.
4157272	4165535	One, no one can figure out what turn they're up, and also, um, I don't like waiting, like, 20 minutes between games, or half an hour or whatnot.
4167035	4171237	So, yeah, pretty weak, but that's my FU.
4171337	4171797	Beautiful.
4171817	4173998	My FU of the week!
4174941	4180544	goes to Brad for making me late for that last segment so that Jamie could have her way with making fun of me.
4183696	4186117	And I would like to also give an F you to the coin line.
4186377	4187777	I've ranted about this weeks ago.
4188458	4189558	Completely useless.
4189938	4191018	It's useless these days.
4191278	4196940	Back in the days of Street Fighter when everybody would like watch everybody else play and stuff, it kept places a little better.
4197440	4200061	When people use custom coins, I guess it kind of works.
4200861	4202702	But the way it is now, it doesn't work.
4202742	4203802	You need a sign-up sheet.
4203962	4204723	Fuck the coin line.
4204763	4205123	I hate it.
4205603	4206103	It's stupid.
4206503	4207784	I'm just going to cut in front of everybody.
4209164	4211665	Until you get a better system, I play first.
4215427	4227658	I have my other FU goes toward not having a Duo RX because I want to play Strider and Sapphire.
4227698	4227938	Thank you.
4242614	4243314	Thank you for sharing that.
4243355	4245596	Let's go around the room and hear our guest's FU's of the week.
4247017	4249799	What are you handing me the mic for?
4250259	4254582	Only thing I gotta fuck you is, you know, as much as he's given the U.S.
4254642	4259705	lately, I'd like to put a fuck you out to Itagaki for completely lying to the U.S.
4259745	4264388	about DOA Extreme Beach Volleyball and pushing back the next Virtua Cup for another year.
4264748	4265208	Fuck you.
4267110	4268070	Any FU's of the week, Brad?
4268250	4269431	My FU goes to drama.
4269451	4269871	There you go.
4271624	4273084	Oh yeah, I have an FU for drama, too.
4273144	4273605	It sucks.
4276105	4278566	No more drama in my life.
4278686	4280466	Actually, wait, I have my anthem.
4280726	4283507	I have my anthem because I'm so sick of drama.
4283607	4284727	I've had it with drama.
4284847	4285908	I don't want no more drama.
4286548	4288868	I have... No, wait, I have my anthem.
4288928	4289268	Hold on.
4289548	4290849	Hold on, I've got it somewhere.
4290909	4291269	Where is it?
4291309	4294690	Damn it, damn it.
4294850	4295230	Shit.
4295850	4296410	I have it somewhere.
4296510	4296790	Hold on.
4297010	4298791	FU to my computer for being unorganized.
4301437	4301997	I'll find it.
4303938	4305678	F this song, this song's so annoying.
4305758	4307039	You picked it.
4307439	4308899	Yeah, I did.
4309899	4311660	Fuck this paper airplane!
4311700	4317862	F you the random-ish eartrick for picking bad songs all the time.
4317882	4319262	Because you made me late for the last segment.
4319962	4322823	I don't like playing QD Chaser three times in a row, thank you, random.
4324264	4325924	You had to play QD Chaser how many times in a row?
4326044	4328085	Three times in a row, so it's a random suck.
4329449	4331610	I can't find my song, piss me off.
4331810	4332090	Shit.
4332150	4334732	Oh well, I guess another time.
4334832	4335152	Oh well.
4335272	4335992	Oh well, a hopeless quest.
4336012	4338414	Alright, let's read the chatroom FUs, shall we?
4352076	4359312	1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Fuck being tired, fuck algebra 2 that is, fuck algebra 2 and fuck me for not being able to type
4361900	4362741	EOSFEB!
4362821	4364061	Fuck you to people with fuck yous.
4364602	4365602	What do you have to be mad about?
4365622	4366803	There's a new Matrix trailer.
4367283	4368104	Wait, I take that back.
4368524	4374707	Fuck you to all the sportsbooks here who paid the Raiders to throw the game after overly hyping how much ass the Raiders were going to kick ass.
4374727	4376548	The house always wins because the people make stupid bets.
4376568	4379290	What are you talking about there's nothing to be fucking mad about?
4379530	4381391	The Matrix movie isn't out yet.
4381431	4382131	Throw up the trailer.
4382191	4384213	Is that to wait like three months for the movie?
4384233	4385533	It's too long!
4385633	4386074	Oh, Christ.
4390540	4391901	Fuck the Daredevil movie.
4392562	4398007	Ben Affleck will make a shitty Daredevil and the chick that got to play Elektra looks nothing like her.
4398487	4399448	But I'm going to see it anyway.
4400349	4402191	And fuck me for wanting to see it.
4402291	4408277	Yeah, I mean, come on.
4408297	4409458	Elektra is Asian.
4410245	4411366	Her character's Asian.
4411846	4413127	The chicken alias is white.
4413627	4415668	And not just white, trailer trash white.
4415748	4417129	They needed to get Tia Carrere to play her.
4417729	4419250	Yeah, or Asian Carrere.
4419270	4420330	Tia Carrere is the shit.
4423212	4426053	I was thinking... Dean's World is the shit.
4426133	4427394	No, not Lucy Liu, man.
4427494	4428754	Ugh, Lucy Liu sucks.
4429195	4432716	How about the chick from Crutch and Tigger Didn't Drag?
4433217	4433537	Oh, um...
4434840	4436202	Yeah, yeah, the one that was in Rush Hour 2.
4436242	4440005	She would have been fucking awesome, because she taught and she kicked ass.
4440025	4441146	She actually knows martial arts.
4441186	4444288	The chick in Alias is just a fucking little wannabe bitch.
4444729	4447551	I think we should have a later segment, by the way, about Kung Fu Wins.
4447571	4450013	You know what some people would like to point out?
4450133	4453656	Even if the chick that plays Elektra doesn't look like her, Jennifer Garner gots ass.
4453957	4455498	That ass could make J-Lo cry.
4455738	4458220	I'm sorry, you're desperate, because she is fucking ugly.
4458300	4459902	Okay, Elektra is Asian.
4460620	4461742	You are desperate.
4462663	4466068	Bluheimer wanted to share the trailer trash white would be a cool new Crayola color.
4468291	4474861	Actually, I'd rather see Final Destination 2, because I heard people get killed very violently in funny ways.
4474961	4475301	Cool!
4476656	4479380	Funny Death is always fun.
4480120	4482724	Except, you know what, this one time, I have another FU.
4483144	4493117	I'd like to F my best friend from high school, not literally, but I'd like to send out an FU to my best friend from high school because one day I was in a really shitty mood, and he said, I know how I'm going to cheer you up, Rob.
4493497	4495440	Let's go to my house to watch Faces of Death.
4498090	4503896	So, we started watching Faces of Death, and I'm sorry, just, you don't watch it when you're already feeling sad.
4503916	4505417	That movie's hilarious!
4505437	4506278	What are you talking about?
4506318	4506999	It's so hilarious!
4507179	4508300	It's so hilarious!
4508580	4515888	I love that one of the guys, the guy with the station wagon that puts a rocket on the back and wings on it, and it flies over the river, he explodes mid-air.
4516068	4516989	What a dumbass!
4518070	4521213	I saw some guy, he was skydiving, and he gets eaten by a crocodile.
4521233	4522194	It was disgusting.
4523567	4525448	No, it was gross.
4525548	4530030	Actually, you know what, you know what, quote, horror movie, end quote, had funny deaths?
4530330	4530451	What?
4530471	4531751	It was all the Nightmare on Elm Street movies.
4532031	4533352	Yeah, Nightmare on Elm Street movies.
4533372	4534072	That was funny deaths.
4534192	4541656	Movie funny deaths are cool because you always laugh and go, oh, how did they do that, you know, type thing, and oh, movie special effects are so funny.
4542617	4544898	Like in the first... Like the chick that got turned into a cockroach.
4545178	4548620	Or I'm thinking from the very first Final Destination, that chick that gets hit by the bus.
4549060	4550361	I laughed so fucking hard.
4550381	4550541	Anyway...
4553712	4554213	All right, moving on.
4554233	4554853	Back to the chat room.
4555194	4556135	Back to the chat room, my friends.
4556155	4556595	Here we go.
4559278	4559939	Whack-whack.
4561800	4563002	Fuck you to chat cookie.
4564471	4565912	Fuck the Raiders, they suck.
4565992	4570335	Fuck the UC Davis IT people for taking two weeks to fix the connection in the dorm.
4570915	4573457	Fuck the fact that I still haven't played 2DX Iscandia yet.
4573497	4578000	Fuck the fact that no one responded to my post in Comp Sci Class News Group asking for a program partner.
4578360	4581042	I need a partner so I can finish my next program by Wednesday.
4581562	4585585	And fuck sexual frustration, especially at 18 and away at college and a virgin.
4585825	4586025	Aww.
4586886	4588106	Poor baby.
4588126	4588687	Sorry, Loki.
4588707	4590848	That's information you don't want to give out on the air.
4590928	4593010	That's like being hungry in a fast food joint.
4594139	4594920	Yeah, exactly.
4594940	4599342	If you can't order from the menu, there's something wrong there.
4599803	4600903	Hey, you know what?
4601724	4605906	If you want to get laid... But see, the thing is, he has a girlfriend who's saving herself.
4605926	4607447	They're in love and all this stuff, you know.
4607928	4613912	So, we can't exactly just go take him to a bar, get him drunk, and get the little chick drunk and say, okay, here's the bed.
4614112	4615372	I've heard this story before, too.
4615713	4616133	Let's see.
4616293	4618855	I think the game Road Trip, it had something very similar.
4619275	4622197	They're in love, you know, they're way at college...
4622857	4628662	and I believe, uh, what was it, uh, I forget his name, but anyways, it's like, your penis will never forgive you.
4628723	4632006	If you do not take this opportunity.
4632866	4635048	I'm gonna pack up my balls and leave.
4635068	4640373	Okay, there's plenty of pussy wanting to be a pussy there, we call it.
4640393	4640974	Take it there.
4642885	4645366	If you want to get laid, we will get you laid.
4645706	4647067	It just won't be your girlfriend.
4647127	4647567	Sorry.
4647827	4651889	I'm sure she's a nice lady, but if she ain't going to open the legs, she ain't going to get in.
4651909	4652570	In defense.
4652590	4652690	Yes.
4652770	4653190	No defense.
4653290	4653870	Overruled.
4663684	4664384	Objection!
4666946	4668686	I think that it's admirable.
4669727	4671928	You think that it's admirable?
4672108	4672328	No.
4672928	4674729	This is the thing, though.
4674809	4678811	No, you're not going to because you're not mean.
4678831	4679752	And here's what I say.
4681192	4682993	I'm sure she's a wonderful girl.
4683373	4686574	All the girls I dated in high school were saving themselves for marriage, too.
4686895	4689055	And I'd like to point out, I turned out gay.
4689436	4690376	So be careful.
4690556	4691656	Don't make Ryan gay.
4691796	4692497	He won't like it.
4692617	4695078	You know, this might have been popular back in the 90s.
4695218	4695378	1890s?
4695478	4697679	Um, not today.
4697779	4699620	This is, hello, get with the times here.
4699640	4700880	People don't do that shit no more.
4700920	4701960	And when they do, they're lying.
4702961	4705442	For the record, for the record, okay.
4707038	4715522	I said that I was going to save myself for the one person who I was going to spend the rest of my life with, and I did, because I'm going to marry Dan.
4716843	4720805	And so there are people with morals in this world.
4720925	4725127	Screw morals, order some GHB online, that'll get you laid real quick.
4725648	4727649	Although I'm currently living in San Francisco.
4727729	4728769	This is what it boils down to.
4731545	4734387	You don't have to put out for the horny 18 year old.
4734607	4743513	Listen lady, when you're 35 and you're at your sexual peak and no guy's going to have sex with you, don't come whining to us.
4749226	4751967	You may think that, but no, that ain't gonna happen.
4752147	4758168	By then, by then it's like this, okay, you're trying, you're trying, you're trying, oh, fuck it, you know, I give up, I'm gonna go build a car.
4758568	4761328	And then she's like, I want you now, come on.
4761348	4764229	Well, I'm trying to fucking build my car, what the fuck are you trying to do?
4764249	4765809	Trying to get, trying to have sex with me?
4765829	4766990	Where were you 20 years ago?
4767210	4767770	What the hell?
4768530	4769690	Oh, you like it now, huh?
4770430	4771911	See, that's what boils down to right there.
4772331	4774111	Shoes on the other hand now, isn't it?
4776850	4781154	These guys are deplorable.
4781334	4782935	I don't even know the meaning of the word.
4784056	4785117	Rob, go to dictionary.com.
4785137	4787379	Yes, okay, I'm going to dictionary.com right now.
4787399	4791522	I will define the word deplorable for you thanks to dictionary.com.
4791603	4792804	Okay, you know what?
4792824	4796707	Black Lab's FU has just stopped the FU's of the Week segment while we look this stuff up.
4797347	4798348	We'll resume it in a minute.
4798869	4799849	D-L-O-R-A-B-L-E
4804787	4805267	Let's see.
4806368	4809989	Get top ten most popular... Mortivere, condemnation, or reproach.
4810529	4811910	Lamentable, woeful.
4812450	4813550	Wretched, bad.
4814811	4816852	As in, damn you suck!
4819393	4820113	Deplorable.
4820253	4822034	That was the fourth definition there, I think.
4822394	4824735	Yeah, the dictionary according to Jamie.
4826296	4827896	Alright, are we ready to resume the FUs of the week?
4827936	4829457	If you guys all stop talking about sex now...
4834562	4837124	You got that?
4837144	4838465	Dick is in, go choke on life.
4840486	4844929	Ah, Brad's giving me head, life on air.
4845009	4845549	All right.
4846410	4847191	That's a good radio.
4847231	4848231	I bet our radios would go up.
4848391	4849772	Hey, that's what we need to do.
4849832	4850693	Now we've done drunk.
4851559	4854941	Then we need to have the sex show, where we have people get laved live on air.
4855262	4856242	I wouldn't be here for that.
4856422	4856963	I'll be at home.
4857023	4860505	And then we'll have the violence show, where we kill something.
4860885	4863407	Where I take a sledgehammer and go chasing after a bunny.
4864628	4865709	No bunnies!
4865809	4866629	Don't kill bunnies!
4866649	4867290	Sweet!
4867370	4869351	Bunnies are cute!
4869771	4871713	You guys are the name of Oolong!
4874515	4876196	We know what happened to Oolong.
4877270	4878911	Here's a pancake, it's a target.
4879192	4880713	No!
4881934	4882955	You guys are awful.
4883575	4884856	Rob, I like bunnies too.
4885657	4886338	For dinner!
4886858	4887899	You guys are awful.
4887919	4889060	No, Rob's gonna get a bunny.
4890221	4891002	I wanna get a bunny.
4892002	4894464	It's gonna poop little round things all over your house.
4894745	4896006	I only eat the cute animals.
4896066	4897367	You can potty train your bunny.
4897667	4899969	I'm an otter!
4900029	4901570	Can we get back to the chatroom FUs, please?
4901610	4902811	Okay, you don't have to get on here.
4903132	4903532	What are you?
4903932	4904573	I'm a cow!
4904813	4905494	Get on the train!
4906991	4907531	Dennis Leary.
4908532	4909232	Moving on.
4911133	4912573	Just bring out a whole cow.
4912854	4915655	I'll cobra off what I want and ride the rest home.
4917816	4918836	Thank you, Dennis Leary.
4920797	4924859	DarkTetsuya says, a mammoth king-sized FU to the sapphire worm.
4926818	4927138	Oh, is that?
4927338	4928039	Slow it down.
4928919	4930380	Oh, oh, okay.
4930440	4939827	Oh, because he, like, isn't able to, uh... I think he wasn't able to connect to the station for a while or something.
4939847	4943789	Dwayne says, F you to football.
4944490	4947712	F you to the new Stepmania build with exit bugs and background change bugs.
4948613	4950454	F you to himself with big black cocks.
4950714	4955917	F you to everyone who doesn't like his so-called freestyle double routine to the whistle song complete with pelvic thrusts on freezes.
4956038	4956418	Whatever.
4957439	4959200	Blackwing, whatever, why don't you go cry me a river?
4959220	4959701	Blow me a crap?
4959741	4960361	Get over it, guys.
4960421	4961662	And all the other cliche.
4961682	4963103	Maple... Maple... Says... Excuse me.
4963203	4963824	Maple says... What?
4981670	4982290	Ask the Mormon.
4982910	4983170	Yes.
4983771	4984731	Just look at me.
4984831	4985751	I am Mormon.
4985791	4987332	Charge I. I must be God.
4987672	4989192	Don't touch my nipples.
4989712	4991393	I don't know if this is St.
4991413	4993473	Patrick's Day, but if you were in St.
4993513	4995354	Patrick's Day, I don't know.
4995374	4998695	Because in Ireland, it's a lot more orange than orange.
4998715	5003436	So I would actually remember an orange whoever pinched me that kicked the ball.
5003456	5007417	So I'd be like, excuse me, this is the... Anyway, back to the movie here.
5008516	5009697	Can I read Maples F you now?
5009877	5010638	No, I will.
5011198	5011618	Oh, okay.
5012139	5012459	You want to?
5012499	5012959	Go ahead.
5013179	5013860	No, now you're good.
5013880	5014700	Fuck is fuck you.
5016687	5024613	Thank you to my sickness, making me sleep a huge amount of hours, and missing the Super Bowl.
5024633	5026454	Well, you didn't miss anything.
5026514	5028756	Raiders got fucked in the ass and they played a Matrix trailer.
5028936	5029757	There's the Super Bowl.
5029917	5031818	Why are the football games called bowls?
5031958	5033800	You should save those for, like, bowling.
5033840	5034540	Like a fruit bowl?
5034920	5035941	You should save those for bowling.
5035961	5036101	Yeah!
5036121	5036722	Clow bowling!
5036742	5037222	Clow bowling.
5041292	5041934	We have Google.
5042014	5043397	Okay, we'll go Google.
5043958	5046023	Orange Lounge goes to Coldwell.
5046043	5047487	Without you listeners.
5047948	5048870	Yeah, without you listeners.
5048930	5049411	It's private.
5049431	5049692	Yeah.
5052411	5063093	DDRAngel says, my one F you for this week goes to people who are your best friends who are supposed to support you in your decisions no matter what, but they end up disagreeing with you and making you feel shitty, even though you're making a decision you believe in.
5063814	5064914	I have something to say about that.
5065014	5065954	Okay.
5066034	5071475	If a person isn't your friend and they don't listen to what you're doing, it's going to end up hurting you in the long run.
5072016	5074256	They are a better friend than not supporting you.
5074276	5074796	It's, you know...
5079456	5090966	It takes courage to stand up to your enemy, and more courage to stand up to your enemy.
5091087	5103918	And if your friend sees something, or has experience like that, that, you know, is going to say that this experience that you're going through right now is going to come back and bite you in the ass, you better listen to your friend's advice.
5105257	5107298	Especially if that person has the experience to know us.
5107439	5110981	Don't discount your friend just because they're showing a little bit of concern for you, okay?
5111601	5113162	Unless they're drunk, then don't listen to them.
5113182	5114563	Yeah, please don't listen to them.
5114583	5119647	Wow, this orange lounge suddenly got deep.
5120707	5128214	And don't listen to them when they say that some girl likes you, because even though they may be their best friend and they may know them for like years, they're wrong and they like you.
5147771	5148732	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5166580	5183605	If they've had experience that maybe something that you're going through right now isn't necessarily something that might be good for you, if they see potential harm in what you're doing, you'd best appreciate that kind of advice because it takes a lot of bravery to tell your friends, I don't think what you're doing is the right thing.
5183965	5188846	It takes a shallow person to just agree with everything just because they want to keep you as a friend.
5189526	5193789	It takes a really strong person to say, you know, I disagree with you, and this is why.
5194809	5196450	So, that's all it is.
5196470	5198772	You just have to keep an open mind toward what your friends tell you.
5200713	5201013	Alright.
5201753	5206176	Although Angel says she was drunk, so... Okay, if the person was drunk, then just screw it.
5208397	5210739	But still, we appreciated deep thoughts with Jamie.
5211099	5212360	Now back to the pornography chat.
5212420	5212700	Alright.
5215157	5223223	Chubbs says, I can't think of any FUs, so FU to Jack in the Box again for taking away the 99 cent Westerner.
5223964	5225385	How was his FU last week?
5226906	5227187	All right.
5229568	5234993	Stresso wants to get laid live on air, so he's volunteering to come down for that show.
5235013	5235313	All right.
5239959	5241960	Chat Cookie says, Fuck you, Black Lab.
5241980	5243880	You're just jealous of my chocolate chips.
5244461	5248222	Also, I want to send out an FU to everyone that's envious of my sweet perfections.
5250262	5251063	That was a robot.
5253403	5257845	And now, 23rd Bagus has a special little FU this week.
5258545	5263806	And I'm even giving him his own song because he begged and pleaded enough and I just wanted him to stop begging because it was getting sad.
5263886	5265587	So, he's saying...
5266792	5268453	My life is so full of bliss.
5268573	5269734	I have no F you for the week.
5270254	5271755	I do, however, have something different.
5271996	5274357	I'd like to send a love you to DGR Angel.
5274758	5276339	Will you be my Bimani girl?
5277580	5278940	Not just that, something deeper.
5279101	5281963	I love you and I'm willing to make sure we are together and forever.
5282083	5283083	Like the song, get it?
5283564	5284184	How about you?
5284244	5286185	Will you stay with me forever?
5287226	5287626	That was cute.
5290179	5293021	Too many serious moments here on Horse Lounge Radio.
5295743	5299066	And people getting laid, and it's not me, and that makes me cry.
5301768	5304710	Oh, but I am getting a massage, so maybe I like wallowing in my pity here.
5309034	5309914	Why are you crying?
5310275	5311536	Hey, stop it, go give her a massage.
5312416	5312817	Yes she does.
5317984	5318964	Touch me and I'll break your finger.
5346166	5347006	So you know what?
5347026	5349788	We never did get the answer here.
5350308	5354070	It's like, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
5357753	5358233	Yeah.
5359233	5361395	I bet it went to private message, tee-hee.
5362042	5363043	Well, that's not fair!
5364403	5365844	Oh, no, we got big hugs.
5366284	5366985	Big hugs.
5367505	5369286	And oh my god, OMG.
5369586	5370426	We got an OMG!
5371047	5371527	OMG!
5372528	5372808	OMG!
5373288	5373808	OMG!
5373868	5374909	Yeah, you know me.
5375369	5375649	OMG!
5375669	5377470	Okay.
5377990	5378691	Moving on.
5378911	5379431	Let's see.
5380052	5381973	I'm checking some... You down with entropy?
5386075	5387235	Alright, let's check the mailboxes.
5387275	5387956	I forgot to check the mail.
5392027	5395474	USFVB says, being here during this makes me feel gay.
5397739	5399242	No, it's Jamie's town that makes you gay.
5399302	5400645	It's not Orange Lodge.
5404507	5406628	DDR Angel wants me to say what she said in chat.
5406648	5407148	I already did.
5407408	5407768	OMG.
5408748	5408969	Omg.
5409349	5410769	Oh, okay, I didn't read the first part.
5410789	5413470	She caution drops to the ground in shock for a few moments.
5414990	5417031	Then she finds the energy to get up and hugs Magus.
5417211	5417551	OMG.
5418151	5420992	OMG, OMG, OMG, OMG, OMG, OMG.
5422453	5423373	Let's take another quick break.
5423393	5425314	We'll be back with this week's cage match.
5426974	5427835	Just because.
5428135	5430657	Word.
5430697	5435221	We'll be right back after this quick little break featuring... Me breaking stuff.
5436442	5437282	Breaking stuff.
5437863	5440825	And a song from Dance Mania.
5441025	5443767	Just because we feel like playing something from Dance Mania.
5443787	5445809	You want to play some booty Dance Mania?
5446069	5446469	Yeah.
5446830	5450052	Okay, how about... I know I've got one.
5450572	5451393	I know, I'm trying to find it.
5451853	5452154	Here it is.
5452214	5453815	Okay, some booty Dance Mania.
5453835	5454115	Here you go.
5454576	5454936	We'll be back.

5814557	5818118	The following bit of randomness has been brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.
5832631	5832911	Hi!
5834071	5835792	We almost had a... Ask Mike.
5836792	5837652	My God, Rob.
5837693	5838933	I was sitting on the mic, my bad.
5838953	5839613	I'm going to fart.
5839693	5840073	Sorry.
5840093	5840793	Sorry.
5841013	5842854	I'm going to fuck you.
5843654	5846575	Okay, back to the fuck you's of the week.
5846615	5849136	Fuck you to the United States government and our president.
5850552	5860561	for this whole stupid decision about attacking Iraq and all that, because this is only really for a very personal reason.
5860581	5866687	My brother is a Marine, and he has to go to Kuwait next month.
5866707	5867748	So, fuck all of it.
5869469	5869869	I agree.
5870089	5875752	I can't understand when there's all these countries that are against the war.
5876372	5877213	But you know what?
5877253	5878153	He ain't popular with me.
5878193	5880214	Of course, I wouldn't have ever voted for the guy in the first place.
5880294	5881295	You couldn't vote for him anyway.
5881355	5882095	I voted Green Party.
5882876	5883776	Yeah, I agree.
5883816	5887998	I think the whole war is stupid, and I think Bush is just asking for trouble, and he's not going to get reelected.
5888018	5888998	I voted Donald Duck.
5890879	5891700	Donald Duck in 2004.
5895403	5898186	I think when his reelection comes up, we should all vote for Strong Bad.
5899387	5900928	Okay, we'll vote for Strong Bad, that's fine.
5901349	5902089	From Homestar Runner.
5903430	5908795	Everybody go to homestarrunner.com after the show and read the Strong Bad email.
5909075	5909416	Alright.
5909896	5914000	We've said our piece because we don't want to turn this into a completely political show.
5914020	5917723	I just want to send him a letter that says, fuck you right in your ear because your ass ain't good enough.
5920313	5922434	Alright, we're not having a political debate, that's it.
5922574	5925414	She's got personal reasons for being against it, so that's that.
5926475	5927895	Alright, moving on.
5930976	5932096	I don't know, what are we moving on to?
5932156	5932816	Oh yes, the cage match.
5932836	5935817	By the way, I don't give a shit about politics, so there.
5937337	5938798	Okay, moving on.
5938978	5941138	We're going to talk cage match politics right now.
5941198	5943059	That's the politics that are important on this show right now.
5946030	5946410	We could.
5946430	5947311	Do you have anything actual?
5947511	5948012	Sim update.
5948032	5948953	Yeah, give us a sim update.
5949073	5950234	Let's get the show back on track.
5950914	5951755	Yay!
5951855	5952435	Yay!
5952916	5954958	Let's see.
5954998	5960822	Earlier this week, well, actually, a couple of websites are going through a couple of changes.
5961603	5968289	We had a big Bomani-style bitch fest going on, and they're redoing some stuff.
5969890	5972492	They didn't like the fact that people were leeching files off their site.
5973613	5979717	I'm sorry, you don't mean Bomani Style, you mean, well, hold on, keep going, never mind, I've got to get something cute up here.
5979978	5988424	Okay, yeah, other than that, DDR Mania X, they had a whole site relaunched with a brand new design to it, so it's kind of pretty.
5989144	5991366	And so that's pretty cool, they have that going on.
5992166	5999511	See, other than that, Bomani Style is releasing brand new, well, actually, they're the same DDR Extreme files, but now they have backgrounds in them.
6000032	6000232	Woohoo!
6000979	6013880	and so those will be coming up pretty soon they have like three up right now and let's see other than that here let me cut you off for just a second because I wanted to say it's not Bomani style it's
6020120	6025741	The Money Style, because goddamn, they do everything for this community.
6026061	6029462	They bend over backwards and they died on the cross for this community.
6040485	6043408	Are you going to put the announcer files up on your site?
6043468	6044449	Chatroom's wondering.
6066129	6070731	Yes, I am, and I've ripped the announcer files from DDR Extreme with, uh, yeah!
6071191	6072331	So we've got that on there, too.
6072691	6077453	And I'm not slamming on any other websites, by the way, but just, you know, the whole Jesus Complex.
6077613	6078354	It's the internet.
6078414	6079714	Everybody leeches from everybody.
6079754	6080854	That's the whole concept.
6081275	6082215	God, if you don't...
6082850	6085891	If you don't want people to be doing it, don't post it.
6086011	6087672	I mean, it doesn't make sense, you guys.
6088072	6088472	Stop.
6088933	6089413	Be nice.
6089653	6090473	Be nice to each other.
6090493	6091094	That's all we want.
6091254	6092374	Well, here's another thing.
6092394	6094315	They're, like, wondering why people are turned away from the site.
6094335	6094675	Well, let's see.
6094695	6096556	Here's some of your mods that they got to slip.
6096776	6097997	Slip some mod on that site.
6098197	6100758	I don't want to get into personally bashing people on this show.
6100938	6102399	Actually, he had some pretty funny comments.
6102439	6103339	I like reading his stuff.
6103399	6106700	I mean, when he's ripping on stupid people, that's hilarious.
6107241	6107681	But, um...
6108161	6111124	Yeah, see, other than that, let's see some stuff I forgot last week.
6111164	6120694	There was this, um, um, it was a DDR, sort of Amani-related, uh, DDR, like, e-magazine type thing that went out.
6120714	6122876	It had some pretty funny stuff.
6123577	6127261	I wanted to print it out, but it was on my zip drive, so unfortunately I couldn't do that.
6127341	6129563	It was kind of alright, made by some Canadians, I think.
6131185	6146255	Um, let's see, aside from all that stuff, um, oh, DWI Insanity, they just released Easy to Dancer songs, a whole pack of those that are DWIs now, so go check those out, those are pretty cool.
6146535	6149297	Links on DDR Maniacs if you want to check that out.
6149898	6156262	And always just, you know, keep watching their forums, there's going to be, you know, files to release and whatnot.
6156883	6156983	Um,
6157683	6163228	See, DDR East Coast Invasion is going to be doing another Tourney Mix, I'm sure, Tourney Mix 4.
6163568	6166110	They're talking about doing one every three months, I think.
6166150	6168592	So, I'd probably put it in April.
6169293	6176939	And they're also running a contest right now where if you... It's a B-Mani music remixing contest.
6176999	6178580	You just pick songs, remix them.
6178981	6183204	They have to be somewhere from one and a half minutes to, I believe, four minutes in length.
6183604	6183744	And...
6190467	6193529	Black Lab wants to know, when is there going to be a DDR sim for Max, goddammit?
6194609	6195109	For what?
6195469	6196490	Max, Macintoshes.
6197610	6198170	For Max?
6198891	6201832	Um, well there sort of is right now, there's um...
6203059	6206282	Oh, shit, now I remember what it was called.
6206322	6208223	There was one that was for multiple platforms.
6208784	6214648	I don't think it was Pi DDR, but there was one that was for multiple platforms that I posted a long time ago.
6215449	6217230	But, yeah, I don't know.
6218271	6218511	All right.
6218551	6219151	He's just maxed it.
6219171	6220472	That's why they don't make Sims for him.
6220793	6223735	Dude, get out of his lap, man!
6224996	6227658	I'm giving him a lap dance during the show.
6232370	6235594	And no news on Feet of Fury, it's supposed to be finished in March, I think.
6235634	6238138	Yeah, Feet is Fury.
6240220	6240961	Yeah!
6240981	6244546	I know the game's so bad it makes you grow up into a little lizard.
6244566	6244926	What Fury?
6250132	6257460	Black Lab wanted me to ask if you guys were interested in doing... There's actually some new programming coming to Orange Lounge in the very new future.
6257500	6261965	We have the Johnny the Homicidal Maniac special, the drama that's going to be... When's that finished?
6261985	6264187	Do we know when that's going to be finished?
6264227	6264667	I feel sick.
6264728	6264908	Thank you.
6265048	6266029	I don't really know.
6266069	6266710	I haven't heard from her.
6266750	6269673	I actually have to re-record my lines for the Psychic Lady.
6269693	6270334	Ah, okay.
6270894	6277659	We're going to be having a new music show coming that's going to be debuting soon as soon as I get the list from you guys.
6277699	6279080	And I haven't even told Loki about it yet.
6279540	6283182	Yeah, because I'm always on loop, both at work and life and everything.
6284023	6286464	But you guys will be sending me these.
6286484	6288025	We're going to have a long version program.
6288085	6291728	We've had a lot of requests to play more long version Bomani musics.
6292168	6295030	We're going to have a Bomani music block at some point.
6295050	6303657	We might do it at a certain time every day for like an hour, but just like some long versions because we've had some requests to play more long stuff on Orange Moms Radio.
6303677	6305819	So we're going to do long versions of your favorite Bomani songs.
6306659	6307280	I like it a lot.
6307580	6308220	I don't have an orange mold.
6329227	6330507	That sounds like fun.
6330927	6331808	Jamie's raising her hand.
6332248	6334128	So we could like all overact on air and stuff.
6334168	6334548	That'd be fun.
6334568	6335168	Let me talk about it.
6335648	6337149	Shut up, you bastard!
6338989	6342570	I'm going to go get my grandmother to come kill me now!
6345330	6347211	I'm not going to let you see your baby.
6348211	6351992	Oh yeah, well I'm an alien twin from another planet.
6352532	6353912	I came here to steal your socks.
6357298	6360839	I don't have any multiple personalities, but my other ones do.
6362520	6363160	All five of them.
6364400	6365060	And they're twins.
6365301	6370642	And worst of all, I never learned to read!
6370662	6375103	It was like this, y'all were so cool!
6377464	6377884	Okay.
6377904	6379385	We're not nerds here!
6380825	6381405	Anyways.
6381885	6383146	So is that all you have to say about SimNews?
6384485	6389367	There's nothing going on because people are lazy in school and distracted by the Super Bowl.
6389447	6392528	I want some of your nuts, Brad.
6392628	6393709	These are good, thank you.
6394069	6395789	You know, I'm a non-nut person.
6395809	6396690	I hate nuts.
6396950	6397870	Nuts suck.
6399831	6400751	I don't like nuts, man.
6401632	6402912	Your cashews are in the living room here.
6409675	6411995	Alright, we're going to get to the cage match now, finally.
6412756	6412936	So...
6414238	6417280	Last week, in the big, fat, hairy, scary cage match.
6417300	6420963	You know what, I don't even have a song picked for this weekend, so I've got to pick it right now.
6422364	6423305	No, I'm going to do it.
6423365	6424005	You already won.
6424526	6424806	Alright.
6425847	6426467	You can pick your song.
6426667	6427208	Here we go.
6427828	6434173	Remember, you can pick your nose, you can pick your friends, and you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friend's cage match song.
6434533	6442459	Last week, on the Orange Bounce cage match, we had, in a very narrow victory over that Eat Em Up song by FX Twin...
6444625	6450189	The winner of last week's Cage Match was Ayumi Hamasaki with M, the Above and Beyond remix.
6450550	6457995	Oh, by the way, the Cage Match, for those that don't know, we play three songs, most just pick each song, and you can vote.
6458355	6464000	You can vote for last week's winner, you can vote for one of the two new songs, and the winning song goes into rotation.
6464780	6470948	During Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani Music and More Program, which plays all the time on this station when we're not here.
6471589	6473271	So this is last week's winner.
6473291	6474893	We're only going to play a small clip of it.
6475334	6477697	This is Ayumi Hamasaki with M, and you can vote for this.
6477717	6479700	This is the first thing you can vote for in this week's stage match.
6491980	6492901	Thank you for watching!
6545745	6546386	Thank you for watching!
6582072	6585837	Alright, that was last week's winner, Yumi Hamasaki with M, so that's the first thing you can vote for.
6586699	6591906	And, uh, you know what, I don't give a fuck if this is, uh, you know, a little, uh, private shit.
6592186	6596071	Listen, you fucking bitch twin, I didn't fucking diss slip, I was...
6596852	6604677	Making a comment about how Slip causes people that not want to be talking on the forums because anyone that says anything stupid, he will go off on them.
6604957	6606478	I didn't say anything bad about that.
6606538	6607199	That's cool.
6607219	6609320	Because, you know, people like doing that.
6609720	6612422	Hell, I like joking with stupid people and making fun of them.
6612702	6613402	That's my thing.
6613842	6615803	So I didn't make fun of Slip at all.
6615923	6616363	You know what?
6616463	6621424	And they're doing a good job on that site, even though they don't like leechers and that kind of thing.
6621484	6622624	But hey, that's their thing.
6623044	6625365	I didn't ever say anything bad about Slip at all.
6625405	6625865	So you know what?
6625885	6628465	You can go fuck yourself and your fucking band.
6628505	6629605	I'm not talking to you, mister.
6629825	6631086	I think you're my best friend.
6631106	6631566	Guess what?
6631926	6633906	Go fuck yourself there in Florida.
6634026	6636747	Find some old hag and go fuck yourself, okay?
6637347	6638027	Enjoy!
6638307	6647490	I realize no one from Change the Channel listens to this show, but on the off chance that there's one of you listening, do yourselves a favor and ban Twin from your channel.
6648510	6648871	That's it.
6649211	6654992	I realize we don't get along, we don't see eye to eye on everything, dudes that run that place, but you know what?
6655613	6658413	Honestly, human to human, just do yourself a favor, ban him.
6658653	6659714	First of all, you know what?
6660274	6664415	And as for Twin, I put Twin in the same category that I put Slip.
6665536	6666776	People I don't pay attention to.
6667355	6668016	Alright, fair enough.
6668116	6669257	No more personal drama on this show.
6669277	6670578	Didn't we say fuck drama earlier?
6671018	6671278	Look at that.
6671298	6672579	Well, I'm saying fuck it now.
6672599	6673260	I know, I know.
6673820	6674401	I know, it's stupid.
6674661	6675562	Can we do a cage match now?
6675682	6675822	Yes.
6675882	6677003	Alright, let's do the cage match.
6677263	6678964	Jamie, speaking of cage match.
6679885	6681086	My song owns all of you.
6681166	6681687	Just play it.
6681947	6682788	Alright, here it is.
6682808	6684049	Vincent D'Amour with Eternity.
6684169	6687711	Vincent D'Amour with Eternity is Jamie's pick for this week's cage match.
6687752	6688092	Enjoy.
6689253	6696519	Imagine there's a place in the light you see
6697774	6699557	It's not only in your imagination.
6701741	6705688	This is our reality.
6705708	6706209	Can you feel it?
6706249	6708173	Let me take you all the way.
6749080	6751951	Thank you for watching!
6779468	6780491	Thank you for watching!
6848478	6849060	and many more.
6900510	6901611	All right, neat.
6901791	6903212	That was in the cage match.
6903973	6906655	Vincent Damore with Eternity, the full vocal remix.
6907556	6912980	And now I have a controversial pick for this week's cage match.
6913480	6915422	Oh, I'm sorry, yes, we have to go around the room and rate it.
6915822	6916242	My bad.
6916723	6917724	Ten for Eternity.
6917764	6918644	Any particular reason why?
6918684	6918984	All right.
6919025	6919205	Loki.
6929315	6938881	I liked it, but it's like, it's just, I don't know, it's a bit more, it's an 8, I don't know, because I like all this stuff, but it's not even, like, scandalous.
6938941	6940262	Whoa, that's something I never heard before.
6941643	6945005	Uh, you didn't even hear the song, did you, that we just did?
6945025	6945405	What song?
6945725	6947086	Uh, Eternity by some more.
6947566	6948206	I've heard it.
6948607	6949127	What do you think?
6949707	6955471	Um, I think it's a very classic, I agree with Loki, it's not like they jumped out and went, Holy crap!
6957822	6959143	But it's really good, I like it.
6959964	6961025	It's very classic.
6961125	6965109	I'd rate it about, for him, I'd rate it about a 7 overall.
6969494	6971616	Alright, Vincent D'Amour.
6971876	6972797	I love Vincent D'Amour.
6972857	6973317	I give it a 9.
6974118	6974519	Eternity.
6974559	6978322	It's not the best Vincent D'Amour song, but it's pretty damn cool and I wouldn't be sad if it won.
6978943	6981546	So, that's what we all think of this week's Skate Matches.
6982046	7008895	That pick, Vincent Damore with Eternity Now I have a kind of controversial one This is from a trance compilation and unfortunately I don't have the name of the artist that did this I have it somewhere, I just don't have it on me right now I can tell you this comes from the Velfire Cybertrance compilation This is track 4 and this is a remix of Thunderstruck Which was by ACDC originally Which is a group I don't particularly care for usually But I know Jamie really likes them and she does not like this mix at all
7009835	7011018	I already know what I'm giving it.
7011839	7012460	A one.
7012861	7014705	Alright, but judge for yourself.
7014765	7017190	This is the third entry in the cage match this week.
7017310	7018713	It's a remix of Thunderstruck.
7018793	7019033	Enjoy.
7055932	7070443	And I knew there was no turning back My mind raced and I thought, what could I do And I knew there was no help, no help from you Thunder
7105607	7106329	Thanks for watching!
7162336	7163698	Thank you for watching!
7224389	7228871	All right, that was from the Vellfire Cybertrans CD, Thunder.
7229931	7230492	A little remix.
7230592	7231912	I'm about to throw up.
7233193	7235674	All right, Jamie, dare I ask, what did you think of Thunder?
7236134	7236734	Negative 12.
7237615	7241416	Sorry, I love this song.
7242537	7247479	And I like how they simulated the guitar rest of the keyboard.
7247659	7249319	But I hate that it even exists.
7249339	7252081	That's a song you should never transmix a CD to.
7255783	7256043	No.
7259207	7261950	I didn't like the original, and I hated the remix.
7262471	7263893	It's just, you don't mix that together.
7263913	7266416	That's like mixing Ozzy Osbourne and Vince Samore.
7266456	7268999	I mean, it's just... It doesn't make any sense.
7270080	7270280	No.
7270701	7271041	Awful one.
7271061	7272303	Even better, uh...
7274190	7277752	What did you think of that Brad?
7278253	7279894	I caught like the last five seconds.
7281414	7283356	Give it a 10.
7283556	7287218	I didn't hear it, but now that I think I understand what it was, it was Thunderstock?
7287258	7288739	Yeah, but it was a cool transmit.
7288879	7289619	Oh yeah, that's cool.
7289639	7290900	Dude, that DJ should be blacklisted.
7290920	7294002	Never really allowed to do anything like that.
7300906	7302147	All right, fine.
7302167	7305268	Then I'm giving it a 10 simply to counterweight the rest of your votes.
7305288	7308650	Sorry, but you're dealing with two 1s and a minus 12.
7309970	7310971	Your 10 loses.
7311611	7311991	I give it a 10.
7312711	7311991	10, 10, 10.
7313812	7315172	It gets an overall of negative 1.
7318062	7318723	I gave it a minus 12.
7320023	7322125	Alright, I'm giving it a zero.
7323045	7323826	Yay, Loki.
7324166	7331330	Alright, so send in your votes right now over private message in the channel and we'll tally up those votes and have it for you later.
7331390	7335653	You can vote for either Ayumi Hamasaki, Tally Wacker.
7340196	7342297	You can vote for Vincent Damore with Eternity.
7353792	7355574	Oh, gee, I guess there are no exciting parts, sorry.
7355935	7361421	And then the trance remix of Thunderstruck that nobody likes here at Orange Lounge is at me.
7368519	7372361	All right, so you can vote for any one of those right now, right fucking now.
7372821	7373881	This should be called Blender.
7374381	7374722	All right.
7374902	7375282	Blender.
7376142	7377763	And the winner goes into rotation.
7379844	7380664	On the Bomani Music War.
7380744	7381044	Sorry.
7381104	7384525	I'm going to give you all an STD live on air.
7385786	7388267	Hi, I'm getting weird looks.
7389427	7390428	AIDS for everyone!
7392881	7397942	That's going in the next intro.
7398463	7401443	And I'm going to give all the little underprivileged children in the world AIDS.
7401683	7402284	Myself.
7403584	7404464	You're awful.
7405564	7406905	You're an awful person.
7407725	7411786	Brad will give them all AIDS and I'll give them a kick in the ass.
7412506	7415067	Yes, because I'm Jared Fogle from Subway.
7415607	7418688	You'll give them AIDS and I'll give them a yeast infection.
7421409	7422089	Wait a minute.
7423334	7429155	Do you keep it in a jar or something so you just open it up, can of yeast infection and dump it on somebody?
7429195	7432876	The little yeast infection goodies.
7433176	7434697	What disease would you like to transmit?
7436737	7439138	Uh, I could transmit the stupid, I guess.
7442358	7444759	I have the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie-woogie flu.
7447923	7449224	What disease do you want to transmit, Rob?
7449244	7450685	What disease do I want to transmit?
7451165	7451505	2DX.
7453386	7456068	I want to transmit mental retardation.
7456448	7457949	I want to transmit the gay gene.
7465854	7467876	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7483590	7484231	I don't want women!
7507588	7508329	and then I hugged Armine.
7510070	7510230	Ow!
7510770	7512211	Lesbian sex, A+.
7512792	7514573	We need some hot lesbian action on Orange Lodge.
7514593	7516515	We need to call up Amanda and Yana and get them back on air.
7516555	7516695	Yep.
7518776	7521598	You know what's sad though is that Yana moved to the Bay Area to be with Amanda.
7521838	7524140	Sorry, I don't want to see my ex-girlfriend having lesbians.
7528483	7529964	What if your current girlfriend had lesbian sex?
7529984	7530485	Would that be okay?
7532287	7533367	Hey, hey, hey.
7533427	7534647	Hey, hey, hey.
7534728	7534988	All right.
7535228	7536628	It would be better if you were involved.
7536908	7537228	Ow!
7537268	7540149	Then it wouldn't be officially lesbian.
7541209	7555692	Well, that's, see, any straight guy, any straight guy that wants to see lesbian sex has this, you know, thought in the back of his head that it's not really lesbian sex because they'll be all, oh, gosh, we're having lesbian sex and it's so great, but we really need a dick right now.
7555772	7556472	Join in.
7556492	7557212	And, you know.
7557992	7560453	What they don't know is that they don't want the dick.
7560473	7562013	I mean, they're lesbian sex.
7562713	7564814	They hate dick.
7564834	7565374	They're lesbians.
7565394	7566715	They're not going to get with you guys.
7567195	7567615	Come on.
7568735	7573757	Yeah, what I don't get is why guys are so hot about seeing, you know, two chicks getting it on.
7574237	7579279	What did you say earlier in the show about wanting to have that room at Golfland where the hot guys get it on with each other?
7580059	7587602	But yet, you know, a certain significant other of mine has a problem with me wanting to see two guys get it on.
7588702	7589062	Why?
7589162	7590823	He's jealous of my Dojinshi collection.
7592210	7604020	I don't understand what the problem would be.
7604060	7608303	I mean, it's like, I mean, hell, if I saw two lesbians, I wouldn't expect to be jumping in.
7608383	7609965	I mean, hello, lesbian.
7610525	7612427	Meaning, they don't have sex with men.
7613331	7613951	You're just watching.
7613971	7617332	It's like a porno without the TV and not the video, without the videotape.
7617412	7620072	Oh, and welcome to the real life, you know, thing here.
7620132	7621472	Most lesbians are pretty ugly.
7621812	7634935	Well, no, for guys, you know, I think, for guys, I think it's okay because I think it's, you know, an easier time for, you know, guys to get it on so women should actually have the advantage in seeing the yaoi thing.
7635475	7641476	But, you know, it's, I think, harder for girls to be stimulating without having the tools.
7643363	7643904	I'm confused, maybe.
7643924	7644504	It's more effort.
7645625	7646426	For girls, too?
7646466	7646946	I think so.
7648888	7649729	You have to have skill.
7650249	7655313	See, girls, they have access to the equipment 24-7, so they know exactly what to do.
7660238	7663801	I'm talking about how I jack my hot spicy boner every day, guys!
7664021	7667544	Yeah, see, guys can get themselves off at any given time, okay?
7668185	7669125	And girls can, too!
7669226	7670106	It just takes a little longer.
7670126	7670607	Not necessarily!
7671565	7672346	I'm sorry, Jamie.
7672366	7673687	I'm not elaborating on that, though.
7675929	7676950	Chatroom, what do you think?
7677350	7678051	Yes, talk to us.
7678071	7679472	Who has an easier time getting off?
7679672	7682815	How many girls are in the chatroom now that can tell us how quickly to get off?
7682855	7685517	I think it would take absolutely nothing for a guy to get off.
7685777	7687059	Yeah, it could take me about five or ten seconds.
7687079	7688540	Guys pop boners at the most stupid things.
7689741	7692443	Dude, when I first saw Metroid Prime... Oh...
7695980	7697141	You mean you don't get a clit on?
7698481	7699722	Remember the porno last night?
7699742	7700882	They were talking about clit ons.
7701442	7702783	It doesn't work that way.
7703763	7705124	It does not work that way.
7706404	7708165	Because we're more sophisticated beings.
7708565	7709706	Oh, oh, wait a minute.
7710786	7711366	Hold on.
7711486	7713547	It takes more to simulate a woman.
7715588	7717389	It takes diesel-powered equipment.
7720459	7741238	I have to seriously give you that, I gotta give you a copy of that Sexcore TV, the movie, that's hilarious, she has, she has, okay, you know how they have those, um, uh, those, like, hedge clippers, you know, with the blade that goes up and down, okay, well, imagine that, but you strap a dildo to it, and she's just like, going, going at it with that.
7742009	7742289	Alright.
7743190	7745974	I think we're going to take a quick break and try to get the show out of the toilet.
7746474	7749437	Um, when we come back... I found a funny site.
7749698	7750078	Oh dear.
7750098	7752080	I was looking for Dojin Shi and I found a site.
7752421	7753923	I think it's gone now called Ass Machine.
7753943	7755144	Jesus!
7758307	7778039	Where it had these like, these, some really hot guys in the site though But it was this different machines they made with dildos on them And guys attached to them It was funny I was looking for a dildo and I found this This show is more in the potty than any other show we've done in the past What's our rating?
7779080	7780861	Hey, what about the cage match?
7780901	7787505	We're gonna tally up those votes during the break Yeah, we're gonna get a break and try to be unfilthy We're gonna do the break, we're gonna try to unfilthy ourselves When we come back
7788340	7789641	Ask Machine Ask Orange Lounge Remember, Ask Machine
7812429	7819394	Alright, well, okay, Loki's going to give us a song during the break as well, but first we'll play something from Bomani.
7819874	7832703	And my song is going to be coming from a punk band that I know called The Secretions, and this is from their debut CD called Till Death, and the song we'll be playing is called Boner.
7832723	7833004	Okay, cool.
7833024	7834104	They're going to love it.
7835045	7835706	After some tack.
7836066	7838728	We're going to hear a tack song and then we'll get to that.
7839108	7840249	Alright, here we go.
8031617	8055418	I'm between my thighs, I'm the bread, you're the oven, you make my biscuit rise I'm gonna kiss you where it stinks, touch you where it stinks Do the things that mommy says you shouldn't wanna think Gonna bet my hips against you when you hold me So you can witness, pretend what you do to me That's not a pickle in my pocket, that's my purple passion rocket Getting set to blast off just for you, for you

8403873	8404113	Live.
8404413	8404693	Thank you.
8406473	8407454	We didn't even really talk about this.
8407494	8408474	This is episode number 30.
8408554	8410335	We're over the hill now.
8410635	8410935	No, that's 40.
8411937	8412297	Over the Hill's 40.
8412718	8413198	Sorry, my bad.
8413378	8415840	Well, when I hit 30, I'm going to be crying because I think I'm over the hill.
8416000	8416920	We're at our sexual peak.
8417240	8418261	Yes, we're at our sexual peak.
8418321	8420102	Oh, that's what's happening to this show tonight.
8420222	8420663	I get it.
8421103	8423264	Orange Lawn's radio is at its female sexual peak.
8426466	8428047	Yeah, I've been there and back.
8428067	8430589	You mean you've done a 30-year-old?
8430869	8431770	You've done a 30-year-old?
8433631	8434111	No.
8434592	8434912	Would you?
8437433	8438694	You're talking about a woman here, right?
8438794	8439054	Yes.
8440936	8441476	Maybe.
8441937	8442797	If she was hot enough.
8443958	8444478	I did one that was 28.
8444518	8445399	Does that count?
8446039	8446259	No.
8446620	8447140	Oh, okay.
8448321	8448521	I was 17.
8448701	8449381	No, I'm kidding.
8449461	8453184	What if she may not necessarily be hot, but was incredibly skilled?
8455751	8457312	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8480928	8484409	You know, but see, now the whole thing with the swallowing, I don't even get that.
8484449	8485829	I mean, who cares?
8485929	8486470	That sucks.
8487070	8489290	Why does, okay, she gets like the best out of both worlds.
8489310	8491171	She gets to eat and she gets to have sex.
8491611	8492911	What the fuck is up with that?
8492931	8500413	I mean, if I could have a, if I could have a pizza and be getting hit at the same time, man, I, I'd be the happiest guy in the world, man.
8500453	8502134	You're eating pizza, hey, good job.
8503945	8504386	You know what?
8504486	8506468	I don't see why people are so fascinated with that.
8506488	8507389	I don't even understand that.
8507409	8507890	It's stupid.
8507930	8510492	It's like... I want to know what the advantage of putting something... Do you want a medal?
8510512	8511453	Do you want a pat on the back?
8511594	8514817	I want to know what the advantage of putting something in your mouth that a guy pisses with.
8515238	8515538	Okay?
8518421	8522986	Well, uh... It goes both ways, you know?
8526599	8526879	All right.
8527899	8532601	We're going to do a segment here that we did a couple weeks ago that everybody loved.
8532641	8533421	So we're doing it again.
8534241	8535562	It's called Ask Orange Lounge.
8535702	8536182	That's right.
8537442	8541363	You can send us your questions over private message to me in the chat room right now.
8542644	8545364	And we'll answer them live here on air.
8545384	8547165	We're going to start with a question from EOSFVB.
8548641	8552482	Who says, I am trying to compile a list of places to have sex.
8553462	8555142	Orange Lounge Cast, please help me.
8555803	8558783	And I wanted to clarify, he is in Vegas, and he says yes.
8559343	8563884	And he already has listed at the Tropicana because they have mirrors on the ceiling in every room.
8564104	8565245	So the Tropicana is taken care of.
8565685	8567805	So, places the OSFBB needs to have sex.
8570086	8570546	In Vegas.
8570886	8571966	I've never been to Vegas.
8572006	8572946	You've never been to Vegas.
8573186	8573686	I've been to Vegas.
8573826	8576167	You need to have sex at Gypsy.
8578916	8580897	Hopefully he catches the reference.
8581097	8585498	What's that place that was in Showgirls?
8585798	8586358	The Cheetah.
8586599	8588039	Yeah, you need to get a lap dance at the Cheetah.
8588119	8589599	Okay, you need to get a lap dance at the Cheetah.
8591240	8594181	And then rent a nice room at the Monte Carlo.
8594921	8595261	Okay.
8596802	8597742	Yeah, Monte Carlo's good.
8598062	8600483	He does for classy.
8600663	8602183	There's so many whorehouses.
8602403	8602663	You know what?
8602683	8605404	You need to have sex in the desert next to a cactus.
8605564	8606365	I think that would be fun.
8606625	8607265	And then eat it.
8610095	8612075	Eat some peyote and then have sex.
8612215	8612896	Okay, cool.
8613196	8615056	And get some free sex flyers, too.
8615076	8615596	That would be cool.
8615876	8620357	You can get those cards that have the transgendered women on there.
8621417	8624138	Yes, you need to have sex with somebody transgendered.
8624158	8624698	That would work.
8625058	8628859	You know how they have those lunch cards where they punch them and stuff?
8628879	8631459	You need to get one of those for a prostitute because that would be hilarious.
8631639	8632419	Okay, cool.
8634220	8635660	Where else in Vegas does he need to have sex?
8635700	8636140	How about...
8638172	8640674	On top of that spinning guitar at the Hard Rock Hotel.
8642376	8644397	The basement at the Excalibur.
8644738	8646279	The basement of the Excalibur.
8646999	8648100	On the Technomotion machine.
8648120	8649902	Ah, okay, on the Technomotion machine.
8651003	8651483	You know what?
8651583	8658329	You need to have sex at Caesar's Palace in the forums, like on the fountain with the animatronic Neptune guy.
8658849	8659970	That's where you need to have sex.
8660270	8661872	On top of the pirate ship that burns.
8662012	8662252	Yes!
8663053	8664594	On a pirate ship in Treasure Island.
8664934	8665755	Good, good one.
8667020	8668980	Go on the one that sinks while it's sinking.
8669421	8672481	So have sex on the sinking boat at Treasure Island.
8672601	8673261	That's our answer.
8673642	8674682	That's where you need to have sex.
8675082	8675342	Alright.
8676282	8676802	Hope that helped.
8678263	8692146	Black Lab asks, Puppy wants to know, based on everyone that we've met on this show, if everyone there in Channel Orange Lounge and the studio were to get into a big fight,
8693231	8693531	Ever guessed?
8713823	8716986	I'd probably say that Melody would win.
8717867	8718367	Which Melody?
8718407	8719128	We've had two Melodies.
8719228	8721710	We had Angel Melody and then we had Mel B's girlfriend Melody.
8722091	8724233	Okay, so that would be Shark Skrull Melody.
8724253	8725314	Because she's badass.
8725874	8726515	No, I think she's badass.
8726575	8727296	Of us, I would win.
8732114	8734056	Wait, if the three of us got in a fight, you mean you would win?
8734076	8735898	All I have to do is kick both of you in the balls.
8736759	8737780	We could kick you in the boob.
8738461	8739221	You've got two of them.
8739722	8740483	One foot each.
8740683	8741684	Yeah, but you know what?
8741724	8743245	Guys see that coming here right away.
8743265	8745548	I mean, that's just like a big target.
8745808	8746428	Hit me here.
8746449	8748390	I mean, we're expecting that, okay?
8749271	8751433	I'll smack you both in my purse if I have the time.
8768727	8770548	Anyone who's ever been in the chatroom, Clint.
8772409	8772910	That's true.
8773190	8775011	Yes, that would be the lose.
8775251	8776091	Shine lose right there.
8777012	8779633	Of the folks in there right now, you know what?
8779833	8781675	I think Chubbs would kick a lot of ass.
8782215	8784116	I think Chubbs would lay the smack down.
8784356	8790960	I think it would come down all to Chubbs and Mel B. Mel's not in the chat right now, but he's been on the show before.
8791000	8792641	I think that's where the fight would come down.
8795129	8796971	I think Wendell would kick some ass, too.
8797311	8798933	Dude, Wendell would kick all kinds of ass.
8799634	8805100	That's true, but Wendell's never been... Oh, Wendell's been in the segments, on the interview segments, so I guess that counts.
8807442	8811867	Dude, but I think that overall, Jahi would own everybody, just the personality alone.
8812347	8814430	True, Jahi would yell everybody to death.
8817513	8818874	He's my great defender anyway.
8821536	8822457	Alright, so that's your answer.
8822477	8823218	That's who'd win a fight.
8824238	8827981	Alright, moving along here with Ask Orange Lounge.
8828001	8828922	We're running out of questions.
8828962	8829542	We need more.
8829842	8831023	Yeah, question us.
8831143	8838149	You can also send us questions over email to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com and we'll answer those live on air as well.
8839486	8841948	Remember, if you ask a personal question, we don't necessarily have to answer it.
8841968	8845029	Yeah, if you ask a really, really personal question, we may not answer.
8845369	8847971	Or we'll make something up.
8849592	8849892	Okay.
8851013	8853454	Ah, there's an interesting question from Shadow.
8854295	8855856	Speaking of personal questions.
8857016	8861959	Jamie, what is the best position for giving the chicks the best sexual satisfaction?
8865321	8866802	Jamie continues doing her nails.
8866822	8867042	Yes.
8868757	8871719	Are you going to answer it, or are you going to tell them to... The mechanical one.
8876122	8878303	So basically guys are incapable, so give it up.
8879444	8879964	Yeah.
8881285	8881765	Okay.
8881906	8885448	I don't think a guy can pleasure a woman as well as she can figure out how to pleasure herself.
8886088	8887109	Oh, zing!
8888990	8890531	You would think that, yeah, of course.
8891392	8891872	Apparently...
8898647	8904230	Except, you know, remember, masturbation and porn are for people who don't get laid.
8904250	8905390	Porn is just comedy.
8907251	8909972	I agree with you there about porn being comedy.
8909992	8910833	That's just fun.
8911433	8915435	It's like, why try to inject a plot into something that really means none?
8915475	8917176	That's what I think.
8917236	8918796	Because it's funny.
8921880	8922761	Alright, moving on.
8923141	8925422	We have another question from EOSFBB.
8926723	8932046	He has on his list, his list of places he wants to have sex, he says, sex in a confessional, good kinkiness or morally wrong?
8932887	8933207	Well...
8934167	8936769	Well, they had that contest going on the radio a while back.
8936849	8939051	I was going to say, Opie and Anthony, remember those kids?
8939171	8944074	They got kicked off the air for that shit, so we can't really answer that because we don't want to get... Oh, wait, we're on the internet.
8944114	8945075	We can do whatever the fuck we want.
8946336	8949418	Go fuck in the changing room that the priests use.
8950399	8952261	Ah, that's better than the confessional.
8952281	8954002	You might walk in on them with a little boy or something.
8954062	8954502	Use the pew.
8954522	8955123	Sex and a pew?
8961106	8963027	I would be afraid to have sex in a church.
8963168	8966569	I think the problem with sex in a church is that I wouldn't be able to get it up.
8966749	8968951	I'd be too afraid of, like, lightning hitting me.
8970992	8971252	Okay.
8972573	8974373	We both just hear a blink, blink, blink.
8975114	8976194	Alright, see, that's the thing.
8976234	8977755	I don't think you can have sex in a church.
8977775	8978856	I don't think you'd be able to get it up.
8978876	8980937	But if you can, hey, you're weird.
8981357	8981717	Alright.
8984199	8986560	Oh, uh, Stresa would like to point out he hasn't gotten any...
8989249	8990589	But have you gotten compliments?
8990710	8992630	Yeah, that's the thing.
8993290	8998312	Women a lot of times, you know, they're not going to see anything because they're afraid that they'll hurt your feelings or something.
8998432	9001013	Then again, there's those women that are like, you fucking suck.
9001533	9003414	But, yeah.
9004534	9006574	I don't know, just do this, okay?
9006594	9008995	It looks like she's liking it.
9009015	9009935	Keep doing what you're doing.
9010395	9017616	If she doesn't like it, or it doesn't look like she's enjoying herself, I mean, and you should be able to tell, I mean, none of this, like, she's faking shit.
9017656	9018776	No, you can tell, okay?
9019477	9020357	Tell if she's liking it.
9020477	9023777	Then, uh, if something's not working, then try something else.
9024097	9029818	Just experiment, and you'll eventually find something that, you know, works really good, and just keep doing that.
9029838	9031779	You can only get better.
9031799	9033319	This segment has been Loki's Exception.
9034420	9036322	Sponsored by Folgers Coffee.
9036722	9039145	Um, stress is sharing that he has gotten a few compliments.
9040066	9040306	Aww.
9040326	9040766	Aww, cute.
9040847	9041607	More questions!
9041848	9043169	More quite, we were out of questions.
9043570	9044931	You guys need to send us more questions.
9045191	9045752	Question us more.
9046433	9047734	Send us more questions over private message.
9047754	9051758	You can ask us about something Bomani, that would be okay too, seeing as this is supposed to be a Bomani show.
9052219	9052880	Heh, heh.
9053635	9056337	Yeah, and was Under Station a rocky show?
9056357	9057598	Yeah, true, very true.
9058118	9060359	Oh yeah, listen to understationlive.org, they're back on the air now.
9060640	9063742	I can do Bomani stuff, we've got only like one more thing to talk about.
9063782	9065143	Hold on, then I have to stop the music.
9067424	9073228	Okay, the only other Bomani thing that actually happened this week, the only thing that happened, actually two things.
9073708	9076350	Internet ranking for DV Extreme came up, yay.
9077012	9085956	and they found out if you play Paranoia Rebirth and get double A, play Paranoia Evolution and get double A, then you get to play Paranoia Survivor Max in DDR Extreme.
9086557	9087357	That's about it.
9087837	9089418	Okay, back to the ask questions thing.
9089538	9090279	Alright, ask questions.
9090299	9090559	Here we go.
9090579	9091219	We got another question.
9092960	9094621	Hooray for people saving this segment.
9095941	9098162	Black Lab wants to... Oh, goddammit.
9099443	9102384	When is someone going to kidnap me and take me to Scandia for 2DX?
9102945	9104045	Um, soon?
9105126	9105366	Never.
9106650	9110173	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9129112	9132675	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9157712	9158492	Anyway, sorry.
9158852	9159573	What, you cut your finger?
9159593	9161513	Are you okay?
9162053	9162453	You okay?
9163473	9164354	Okay, JB's okay.
9165114	9165494	Okay, yes.
9167014	9174216	I'm going to be going, and then I'm going to be coming back on Saturday, so I can swing by Davis and get you on Saturday if you want, and we'll go to Scandia on Sunday.
9174236	9174676	How does that sound?
9174696	9176817	I just thought of a guest who can kick everybody's ass.
9176837	9177197	What's that?
9177377	9177757	Shermie.
9178923	9180524	Shermie has been a guest on the show.
9180584	9183825	Do you think Shermie would claw Chubbs to death, even?
9184325	9186306	She would out-cute.
9187287	9187447	Oh!
9187567	9188727	And then Shermie would kick their ass.
9189668	9191489	Well, everyone's like, oh, cute.
9191569	9191929	All right.
9192749	9194650	Shermie's the cutest guest we've ever had on the show.
9194670	9195170	And you weren't here.
9195870	9196471	I know, I wasn't here.
9196491	9196771	I'm sorry.
9196951	9200613	Shermie was in the show at my house, and Shermie was like, I'm in the show.
9200913	9203094	And she purred on the microphone.
9203134	9204074	She farted on the microphone?
9204094	9204614	She purred!
9206375	9206855	My pussy.
9207976	9208216	All right.
9209110	9210572	People have met my Shermie.
9210592	9212874	My baby.
9212995	9216098	My cat is cute, right?
9216118	9217259	My cat's cute.
9218060	9218361	Alright.
9219522	9220003	Moving along.
9220063	9221204	I stress I agree.
9221224	9222886	Shermie is the cutest pussy he's ever seen.
9223086	9224027	Yes, thank you.
9224087	9224328	Alright.
9224588	9225209	More questions!
9228023	9228564	23rd Magus.
9228764	9230465	Oh, he's got a Bamani-related question.
9230505	9230866	Beautiful.
9231426	9233128	What are some of the easiest katas?
9233348	9236090	I have four so far, and I want to get more under my belt.
9236631	9237011	Good question.
9237031	9237431	Kakumei.
9237792	9238312	Kakumei?
9238352	9238692	I feel.
9239233	9240674	I feel.
9240754	9241515	Hypnotic Crisis.
9241635	9242375	Hypnotic Crisis.
9242435	9243036	My Summer Love.
9243957	9244297	I think.
9244317	9244897	I think.
9245378	9246419	Especially if you speed it up.
9246439	9252183	Yeah, well, then I'm thinking kind of like 78, Matt.
9252203	9252364	Yep.
9252384	9256427	Just about all the ones in Max except for Stay and So Deep, which I'm close to So Deep.
9258229	9260752	I would say, I think Twilight Zone is really easy.
9260792	9261552	Of course, it depends.
9261993	9264355	It depends if you, because there's two types of people.
9264796	9267199	There's the people that can get the weird rhythms really easy.
9267399	9271844	So if you're that type of person, you can get Orion 7-8, I feel those kind of cat is no problem.
9272711	9276132	I have issues with my stamina, partly from my asthma and having a bad knee and a bad ankle.
9295697	9297138	First CATA you guys ever passed?
9297498	9300760	Hypnotic Crisis Same here, Hypnotic Crisis What was the first CATA you ever passed, Loki?
9301040	9306702	First CATA I passed was on doubles and that was Make Your Move Make Your Move Really?
9306742	9307502	That was a CATA?
9307743	9310744	That's a CATA Okay, second CATA you guys passed, do you remember?
9311522	9322966	Gradius Exciter Mine was Orion 7-8 La Senorita Doubles I was better at doubles than I was singles for the longest time What was the first singles category you passed?
9323027	9336212	I don't know if I remember I think it was Dead End Oh, no, no, no, no, I do remember the easiest one to pass Paranoia Eternal, but with the fifth mix steps were heavy Ah, okay, Paranoia Eternal on fifth mix I know my favorite one Lupin, remember?
9336732	9339453	Lupin, yeah I don't think Lupin's that easy, though
9340525	9344608	We're at the party at one of our old Bitmoney parties back at the old group.
9344688	9348891	I mean, we're so old school that every cat is easy now.
9348911	9349752	On a modded home pad.
9350172	9351973	Went back a couple days later.
9352934	9356376	That was actually right before the NGL 2.
9357317	9360419	I think the hardest cats are the ones that run third mix, actually.
9361319	9362060	I completely agree.
9362080	9362880	Well, they upgraded...
9367892	9372855	The Upgraded Paranoia Clean and End of the Century.
9372895	9373615	I beat both of those.
9373976	9374896	Oh, yeah, the ones they have tonight.
9374956	9375857	I beat Dead End.
9375877	9377237	It actually took me a while to beat Dead End.
9377257	9381180	Broken My Heart Sees You Scatter.
9381960	9383021	And Burn the Floor.
9383481	9383701	I'm sorry.
9383841	9384541	That's what I meant.
9384561	9385042	Burn the Floor.
9385062	9385402	I'm sorry.
9385862	9386542	It's not really.
9386582	9388784	That's what it's called.
9388864	9391965	And I actually did legitimately get Captain Jack on 4K.
9391985	9392586	Captain Jack's cool.
9393366	9394627	And you remember how long I was working on this?
9394647	9395107	Yeah, I remember.
9395127	9405913	That was the very... Because I passed every single kata, like, I was in that phase when 4th was still... No, when 5th... 5th was... That's kind of when I was... When 5th was kind of new.
9406273	9409575	And Captain Jack was the very last kata I was able to do, which is kind of weird.
9410235	9411376	Because most people pass it easy.
9411436	9413237	I don't know, it was a pain in the ass for me for some reason.
9413697	9415178	A lot of those, I beat first time.
9415858	9421200	You know, although one I still to this day can't do because my knee always goes out of the same part on this as Exotic Ethnic.
9421980	9423981	Yeah, that's one of the harder ones.
9424961	9425761	You've seen it happen.
9426021	9427962	I'll do Exotic Ethnic and then I'll go down.
9428422	9429402	Literally, I will fall.
9430063	9430563	You've seen it.
9430743	9431063	Go down.
9432983	9434244	You've seen me fall on this one.
9434924	9441570	If you do have good stamina though, Wenda is actually not a bad one I don't know because I never kept track of that shit, I just peed everything
9462860	9463621	Oh, you're so late.
9464022	9469128	Well, yeah, I mean... Yeah.
9469148	9472212	My first seven, though, was Let Them Move.
9472232	9473013	What was Dead End?
9473293	9474415	Dead End's a nine.
9474475	9476077	Oh, okay, because I beat that late.
9478547	9479548	A lot of people did, though.
9479568	9482149	It was harder for me, but I think it was against my own age.
9483370	9489313	I, um, one of the ones that I was really amazed I could get was Breakdown, though, because of the speed.
9489934	9492735	Another real easy one would be, uh, Pernod, A Clean Mix.
9493055	9493316	Yes.
9493696	9497858	But I remember when that was just an 8.
9498178	9498999	Like, I feel it.
9500360	9501100	I feel so easy.
9501981	9502721	Alright, moving on.
9502741	9503682	Some people complained about it.
9503722	9505803	It actually does follow the pattern.
9507304	9507564	Alright.
9509153	9518259	EOSFBB, if I were to have Vid Powah star in a porno in which he fucks chick on a DDR pad, what would be a good song to choreograph this freestyle of all freestyles to?
9518279	9522621	Bomani related, yes, he does know about this, we are currently trying to cast a female.
9523622	9524162	Good luck.
9526084	9527344	After the Game of Love.
9527504	9530546	Yeah, After the Game of Love, definitely, or any erotic song.
9531327	9532167	Or Secret Rendezvous.
9533048	9533608	What mix?
9533848	9534729	We need to know what mix.
9536423	9539789	If they're going to do a porn, they fuck on the DDR pad, but they should be in the background.
9549688	9553890	Say, I would like to hear... D-Level.
9553910	9556591	D-Level would be pretty good, but I was thinking Orion.
9557812	9558932	How about Boom Boom Dollar?
9558992	9560653	Because he could, you know, rest on the rhythm.
9560693	9561833	Boom, boom, boom.
9562193	9565155	And then he could, like, be lip-syncing to Mighty Fine Dollar.
9565635	9566835	No, Pink Dinosaur.
9567095	9568016	Because it's about a penis.
9569685	9570906	or, um, no, no, Walkie Talkie.
9571786	9576629	Just have, okay, have multiple music, multiple different songs for each different scene.
9576649	9578710	You're gonna have Blow My Whistle Bitch for the oral game.
9578730	9580711	Oh, Blow My Whistle, well, this is the thing, this is the thing.
9580731	9581932	EOSFBB gave me the mix.
9581952	9585334	They're gonna try to close game land and do it and use DDR EX.
9585774	9587475	So you can't do Blow My Whistle Bitch, that's not in the EX.
9589357	9594403	All I can say is I'm not going to do a hand clap on that machine ever again.
9594743	9597466	Oh yeah, go ahead, shoot a porno here.
9598688	9599789	He might be friends with the owner.
9601691	9603373	Don't you think he's going to let us shoot a porno?
9604695	9605075	No?
9606397	9607058	Alright, maybe not.
9607919	9609300	India's Family Entertainment.
9610881	9611822	Anyway, next question.
9612142	9612983	Alright, next question.
9613303	9614984	We gave you plenty of good songs to choose from.
9615004	9615545	Pick one.
9615865	9616705	I still say Butterfly.
9617406	9619788	Alright.
9620048	9622069	Stressa says, I was playing AM radio today.
9622109	9623270	I hit a 200 combo.
9623290	9625652	I swear to God, this blue thing kind of reminded me of Tickman.
9625672	9626732	The Tick, whatever his name is.
9626813	9629354	Jump out from the right side of the screen and screeched at me.
9629394	9630195	What the fuck was that?
9630655	9632737	Or is that something standard to an Oni course?
9633692	9636956	No, it's a thing, it's a joke from Mortal Kombat.
9637097	9648051	It goes toasty, yeah, toasty, and it's just, it's a thing that's built into step media when you get, I think it's 150 perfects in a row or something like that.
9648852	9650373	Um, it, it happens all the time.
9650393	9654917	In fact, uh, actually, you have the new, you have different skins you can get.
9655037	9658760	Mine right now is, uh, Casento, which is the blue thing that you were talking about.
9659001	9667067	They also have, they have one with, uh, with Virtu, uh, wearing the DDR, uh, pad, and the, the helmet.
9667968	9668889	It's hilarious.
9669469	9673873	But yeah, that's part of the new DDR, that's the, uh, SM Extreme skin for that one.
9674233	9675414	But, uh, it's pretty funny.
9675494	9677456	You still need to have an Orange Lounge skin for Steppenwolf.
9679122	9680342	Don't look at me, I'm not making one.
9680382	9680742	Why not?
9681142	9682503	Cuz, I'm lazy and I don't... Why not?
9682523	9682863	Come on!
9682883	9683683	I don't do stands.
9683723	9687804	That's true, I can't even finish... I can't even finish my One-Step Mania file I tried to make.
9687844	9688484	Yeah, shit, man!
9689244	9690604	I'm gonna finish it and call it mine.
9690984	9691765	No, bastard.
9693605	9697426	Yeah, so... Insertion.
9697546	9698046	Insertion?
9698626	9699046	What about it?
9700166	9705187	XTC, yeah, but Insertion, I think... Every time I listen to Insertion, I'm thinking it's boring.
9705227	9707608	It just sounds like boring music, it's got like... A lot of bass.
9709199	9712180	If someone would send me the goddamn file.
9712200	9712560	I have it.
9738695	9739936	and you better copy that for me.
9740717	9741778	DCC me that later.
9742018	9745741	Alright, I'll DCC it to Jamie and we play it on fuck-offs occasionally.
9745781	9746502	Isn't that good enough?
9746923	9748644	Isn't shit we do here good enough for you?
9748704	9749145	Jesus.
9751046	9753368	That's the part where Brad's supposed to go, where?
9754770	9755470	We'll think about it.
9758365	9759206	We have no more questions.
9759226	9759886	We're out of questions.
9761548	9762348	You have a question, Jamie?
9762569	9763710	You want to ask Orange Law something?
9763950	9764730	I want to ask a question.
9764770	9765271	I have a question.
9765371	9765691	Oh, you want to?
9765971	9767232	Ooh, reverse.
9767473	9768173	I like this.
9768333	9768974	All right, fine.
9769014	9771416	When they don't ask us questions, we're going to ask them questions.
9771436	9772817	Why won't you ask us another question?
9774679	9777021	Come on, I think you're going to ask him something good.
9777081	9780804	I want you to send me some nice yaoi.
9782017	9784538	Okay, where should they email that to?
9784598	9789399	DarkSakura at idealo.com Alright, here we go, more questions.
9789419	9792720	Oh, that wasn't a question.
9793660	9794740	Stressa says he still loves us.
9795021	9797621	Uh, he better.
9797641	9799762	Ah, good question from Black Lab, very good question.
9800722	9806404	Black Lab wants to know when they're going to see some hot monkey sex on the show.
9806424	9807184	Where's the ferret?
9808430	9809370	I don't know where the ferret is.
9809750	9810671	Where's the ferret?
9810871	9811991	Did somebody kidnap the ferret?
9814411	9815112	Where's the ferret?
9817012	9818272	Oh my god, the ferret's gone.
9818792	9819413	Is it up here?
9820253	9821073	You have a Furby.
9821673	9822633	Yeah, I know I have a Furby.
9824034	9825954	I don't know where the ferret went.
9825994	9826854	The ferret is missing.
9827855	9831035	Okay, we're going to have to find the ferret.
9832036	9834336	When will we have hot monkey sex on this show?
9837057	9837677	We'll see what we can do.
9840214	9842596	Maybe I'll go to the zoo and try to take some sex.
9842636	9844698	Dude, we saw the orangutans.
9844738	9846139	You saw the orangutans having sex?
9846159	9847580	Yeah, and I saw turtles fucking, too.
9848001	9849262	You saw turtles fucking?
9849302	9852224	Yeah, Julie and I went for a school assignment, and we saw turtles fucking.
9852424	9852965	How was that?
9853565	9854226	Slow.
9854826	9861852	It was really neat to see the male turtle standing up, leaning on the shell of the female turtle, go, vroom, vroom.
9865144	9866724	Did he make a vump sound when he did it?
9866924	9869305	No, but it was like that slow.
9869425	9876366	It was like... One... Two... It was... No, it was turtle fucking.
9876386	9880707	We played it and it went squeak!
9880767	9882148	Turtle fucking, yeah!
9882848	9883588	Alright, more questions.
9885708	9887209	Alright, stress out!
9887229	9888329	I saw the lemurs doing it.
9890621	9891462	That's not a question.
9892362	9892823	It's an order.
9893823	9894024	What?
9894064	9895204	It's his next drunk show.
9895244	9896165	Let the hot sex begin.
9896625	9896886	No.
9897166	9897466	No.
9898527	9900248	Dan won't be here.
9900368	9906532	Oh, the ferret.
9906672	9909414	23rd Magus wants to know, are y'all happy for us?
9910275	9911516	So happy we could shit.
9912516	9914478	And is he getting too sappy today?
9917043	9918864	Is he getting too sappy, you guys think?
9919845	9920026	No.
9920246	9922008	But we're going to tease you guys, because we can.
9923069	9924390	I can't find the other yo-yo either.
9924630	9927413	Alright.
9929575	9930857	I know, all the toys disappeared.
9930917	9931938	Oh, there's the yo-yo, I see it.
9932058	9932478	It's on the ground.
9932959	9933339	It's over there.
9934120	9934380	Alright.
9935361	9938605	We're going to take a quick break, and we're going to come back and wrap up this train wreck of a show.
9939325	9939786	We'll be back.
9942719	9943560	Take us to break, Jamie.
9943740	9944201	Yo-yo.
9946163	9946844	Are you a rapper?
9946924	9947485	Yo-yo-yo?
9947545	9948806	Yeah, play with my yo-yo.
9949407	9949647	Alright.
9949667	9950428	Try to play me out.
9950648	9951129	We'll be back.
10038624	10048676	Let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, every night
10174053	10175254	Thanks for watching!
10321134	10321714	VOG Network!
10321754	10321894	Loki!
10348456	10355297	Jojo, Miyato, Okaza, Tosuke, Jojo
10397665	10403332	Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Meow, Meow.
10403692	10404233	Oh, ass!
10404773	10407457	This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.
10411141	10413604	Hi, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10415046	10416828	Loki wanted to talk about how he's going to be famous.
10419077	10419697	Ah, which is Mike.
10419717	10422659	No, I'm not going to be famous, but it was cool.
10422759	10428681	This weekend we went down to Scandia to actually be interviewed by someone for their school paper.
10428701	10429782	So that was fun.
10430082	10431123	And she listens to the show.
10432183	10433264	Cool!
10433504	10434224	We have fans.
10434684	10435425	Yay.
10436025	10437706	So we know that actually someone listens to our show.
10438786	10439066	Right on.
10439466	10448571	Oh, the song, by the way, that we played, the last song before we came back was Dancer, which, by the way, is the best 2DX8 style video ever.
10449032	10457216	And we were talking during the break about, because some of you out there have been demanding that we update our website with our bios because they haven't been up for a while.
10457996	10459617	Loki has never had a bio on the site.
10460418	10460898	I'm sorry.
10461078	10463780	I need a picture of me with my real nose and not a Photoshop nose.
10464560	10467622	You have to admit, though, Glenn did interesting work with those.
10467702	10468122	Interesting.
10469014	10470756	I didn't look anything like myself.
10470836	10473098	Excuse me, I don't look like I'm made out of plastic.
10473738	10475500	Yeah, they did look like we were made out of plastic.
10475560	10476941	And I don't have a Barbra Streisand nose.
10477522	10478362	I had a big nose too, hey.
10478923	10484147	Well, anyway, we're going to take some new pictures of ourselves and we're talking about which 2DX videos we're going to parody to do the pictures of.
10484167	10485489	I don't want to parody a 2DX video.
10485709	10486830	I don't play 2DX.
10486950	10489392	Well, we're just going to dress you up like a pimp because you're the porn king.
10489772	10490713	I'm not a porn king.
10490733	10491594	I don't even own that much.
10491614	10492314	Shut up, you're the porn king.
10494376	10494996	Okay, chat room.
10495497	10495937	Chat room.
10496277	10497077	How are we dressing?
10497157	10498298	I want chat room to vote then.
10498338	10500798	How are we dressing up Loki for his picture on the bio page?
10501499	10505240	We already decided Jamie's going to do the dancer scary Barbie chick girl.
10506120	10506721	That would be funny.
10507861	10509382	You could be a cowgirl.
10510882	10512303	We'll shave your head in odd ways.
10512323	10514323	We're going to set your hair on fire and take a picture.
10516084	10517745	No, we're not setting my hair on fire.
10517925	10519886	I could wear my trench coat and my glasses out.
10519926	10520346	Whatever.
10520386	10521086	We'll see.
10521542	10521822	All right.
10521842	10523583	That would actually be from a 2DX video.
10523763	10525303	Ah, ah, beautiful, beautiful.
10525543	10526523	Snub, Dysphenoid, got it.
10526663	10526983	Stoic.
10527864	10529004	We're dressing up like the Stoic video.
10529024	10529244	Yes.
10529464	10529804	All right.
10529984	10530324	Thank you.
10530404	10531405	You're going to be our tag.
10531425	10531665	Winner.
10531745	10532225	Thank you, guys.
10532585	10532825	All right.
10532865	10535566	But don't be offended if I don't drool over you.
10535586	10536066	Stoic it is.
10536106	10536486	There you go.
10537266	10539907	But we need to actually Photoshop in a Tran next to him.
10540007	10540287	We will.
10541427	10544792	and I'm going to dress up as the chick from the last message video.
10545573	10548476	It's only fitting since I sit on the ground all the time.
10548496	10550459	Yeah, so just sit on the ground all the time.
10550499	10552461	And then I get to be the girlfriend dancer.
10552481	10553462	I'm going to bring in a Barbie.
10554323	10555425	One of my gothed out Barbies.
10557694	10558375	DarkSakura.com
10579458	10593333	I had this weird phase I went through where I was buying Barbies because I... Alright, when I was in third grade I let all my Barbies mold and then I just went off and played with my Transformers and then suddenly I realized that the Barbies that came out for a little while were actually kind of cool except I wanted to alter them.
10596153	10596893	And so I did.
10597513	10597914	Into what?
10598334	10599434	I would actually make their clothes.
10600034	10600374	Oh, that's cool.
10600394	10602155	I'm a little fashion designer.
10602215	10603455	I used to want to be a fashion designer.
10603475	10604616	Did you fashion design for G.I.
10604636	10605036	Joe, too?
10605056	10605836	Because he needed it.
10606616	10607676	No, because you know what?
10607696	10608917	They never came out with the G.I.
10608937	10609597	Joe that had hair.
10610157	10610677	Oh, that's true.
10611218	10612678	I wanted Earring Magic Ken, though.
10612698	10614899	Because Earring Magic Ken came with a cock ring.
10617019	10617579	Seriously.
10618040	10622741	And the guy admitted that when he designed them, that the pendant he wore around his neck really was a cock ring.
10625225	10626146	And they took it off the market.
10626206	10626486	Dot, dot, dot.
10626606	10631649	I bet if you look up eBay and look up Earring Magic Ken, then they're going to be bugs.
10632430	10633010	Interesting.
10633390	10633510	Yeah.
10633871	10634211	All right.
10634231	10634911	A little known fact.
10635872	10637073	Okay.
10637993	10641356	Also, well, we're going to get around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night.
10641796	10644598	But first, I want to say, we didn't even talk about this on the show tonight.
10644658	10646099	It's completely Vimani-related.
10646199	10648000	Huge topic that came up this week.
10648220	10650021	We totally forgot to talk about it.
10650281	10651182	We'll talk about it next week.
10651842	10653984	Max 2 is announced for the USA.
10655365	10656106	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10674620	10675361	Maybe, you know what?
10675782	10678046	We should play instruments live on the show.
10678066	10679708	You should bring in a sax and I can bring in my clarinet.
10679748	10680369	I have one.
10680790	10681050	You know what?
10681070	10681751	I don't have a clarinet anyway.
10681771	10683775	Maybe if I got my own mouthpiece or something.
10683855	10686098	I'll just bring in a skin flute for you to play, Rob.
10690043	10691064	Only 99 cents a minute, don't you know, child?
10691084	10691744	It's all in the cards.
10720165	10721426	Why are you looking at me when you say that?
10721506	10721866	I don't know.
10722907	10723427	You're sexy.
10723467	10725669	Miss Cleo loves the Jamie.
10726449	10729731	Miss Cleo likes the big black cock.
10729751	10731933	Miss Cleo wants to shove this turban up your ass.
10732913	10735976	Miss Cleo likes the big black cock.
10736056	10739598	She has a big black cock going out of her head and she keeps it wrapped up in the turban.
10740609	10742390	She actually has Voldemort on the back of her head.
10742570	10743650	Dot, dot, dot.
10744131	10747432	Alright, let's go around and give everybody's final thoughts.
10747952	10750073	Starting with our guest, Brad, your final thought for the day.
10750093	10750553	I'm a ninja.
10750814	10751394	You're a ninja.
10751594	10751934	Thank you.
10752374	10754575	Jamie, or Loki, your final thoughts for the day.
10755075	10755816	I like FLCL.
10755836	10762439	Come on!
10762959	10768961	My final thought is that Stapler X is saying Sky's Voice the game is going to be released in July of 2003, and that scares me!
10769662	10769742	Um...
10771022	10773123	Oh my god, the truck have started to move.
10773664	10775245	Yes, that's my final thought of the day.
10775325	10776966	Oh my god, the truck have started to move.
10779047	10781389	I think that Square is top shape in all the world.
10783050	10784550	Good night everybody, thanks for listening.
10784731	10786011	Oh, actually... Eat children!
10786572	10788053	One more quick thing.
10788873	10793476	Usually Jamie is the person behind, the mastermind behind the fortune cookie message of the day.
10793496	10794997	Yeah, I was going to play the Eggo and Company.
10795365	10800027	However, tonight I decided I'm going to interrupt and put in a special fortune cookie message.
10800928	10803149	It's a little bit kind of sentimental.
10803429	10810772	It's kind of a dedication because there's somebody out there that really, when I was a child, indeed anyway.
10810792	10812333	What are you guys laughing at?
10812373	10813733	I'm trying to have a serious moment here.
10813753	10814434	You guys suck.
10815154	10817055	You guys are playing Candy King.
10817595	10821617	I want to say, no, seriously, this is a dedication to Fortune Cookie Message.
10821677	10827840	When I was a young child, there was somebody I was definitely inspired by that I used to watch every week.
10827900	10829921	One of the first shows that I watched all the time.
10829941	10830542	I am crying.
10830802	10836605	And I was definitely influenced by this person and part of the reason that I think I like to entertain.
10837065	10838966	So, kind of a serious Fortune Cookie Night.
10839646	10840427	Caning Rob.
10840707	10841768	And it's very sad.
10842109	10845872	I definitely had a big... I had a big cry this week.
10848334	10848915	I'm sorry, Rob.
10848955	10849936	You guys always ruin it.
10850116	10850576	That's alright.
10850876	10852258	Good night, you guys.
10852998	10853519	Good night, you guys.
