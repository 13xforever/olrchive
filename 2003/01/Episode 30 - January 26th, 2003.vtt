WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:30.000
Oh! Message for you, son!

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
In this episode...

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Hey, is any balls down there?

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
That's the biggest berry you ever seen, Dingleberry.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
What's your favorite security movie?

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Showgirls. Absolutely frightful.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
What's yours?

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Now's the time on Sprockets and me dogs!

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog too!

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
I know kung fu.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
No! What I expect from a punishing physician is a joke.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Hey!

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Dark Sakura.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Shut up!

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Where's my gun? This is my boomstick!

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Sky.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
What kind of what human being would find that funny?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Orange Lounge Radio

01:39.000 --> 01:47.000
We are live, and this is episode number 30 for January the 26th of 2003.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
You're tuned into the Burmani Scene's most apocalyptic radio station of all things Beymani.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Ms. Jamie Summers

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
you know her better as Dark Sakura

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
she does not sound very enjoyed today, I'm sorry

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
okay, we're having some of our feedback issues tonight with the mics

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
what? to what?

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
no, I barely have enough to say this, don't reach my head

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
We all just are having some mic feedback tonight, goddammit.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
We did a system reset and everything.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
Let's see if we can work on that.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
We need a mixing board for this damn show.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
Okay, anyway, also in the house,

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
say hello to our tech master Loki.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
How you doing?

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
I also have special guests in the studio tonight, except they're all in the other room, so fuck them.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
They don't exist to me!

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Oh, here they come. Here I come.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Didn't he just say he sucks on the dick sore?

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Hello, dick suck sore!

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Who are the dick suck sore?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
It would not be nice to have a sore.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Introduce yourselves for the listing on Inclusive.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Oh yeah, I hear everything.

03:13.000 --> 03:35.000
Oh, thanks. I was going to do this. Yeah, I'm Ryan, AKA SDMX, whatever you like.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
No, we don't have the dead airspace because we have that annoying mike coming.

03:38.000 --> 03:56.760
We're going to start right off the gate tonight with tonight's list list and we'll be right

03:56.760 --> 03:59.280
back after this break with a list list.

03:59.280 --> 04:04.240
To start off tonight we're going to play a little song that's really popular in DDR Extreme.

04:04.240 --> 04:10.240
They came over for pop music, and all you kids love it. It's called Daikenkai! Enjoy.

07:04.240 --> 07:30.800
I just need my love for you I need to know, I need to know, I need to

07:30.800 --> 07:52.000
I need to know, I need to know, I need to know how you feel

07:52.000 --> 07:55.100
I'm giving all my heart to You, my love

07:55.100 --> 07:58.260
I just divide my love for You

07:58.260 --> 08:01.840
I'm giving You my heart, my soul, my love

08:01.840 --> 08:05.360
I just divide my love for You

08:05.360 --> 08:08.620
I just divide my love for You

08:08.620 --> 08:12.220
I'm giving all my heart to You, my love

08:12.220 --> 08:14.860
I just divide my love for You

08:14.860 --> 08:19.040
I'm giving You my heart, my soul, my love

08:19.040 --> 08:43.000
And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's

08:43.000 --> 08:45.840
favorite perverse baumanni band, Erotic.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.840
Do it all night. Do it with me.

08:48.840 --> 08:53.840
No, no! That was awful! Bloody terrible! Do you take vocal lessons? Kill your teacher!

08:53.840 --> 08:54.840
In the heat of the night!

08:54.840 --> 08:57.840
Oh god, I think my ears are bleeding!

08:57.840 --> 08:59.840
I liked it!

08:59.840 --> 09:02.840
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula! Next!

09:02.840 --> 09:07.840
Oh... that was cool...

09:07.840 --> 09:12.840
Do you even know why you're here? That was just bloody pathetic! Next!

09:12.840 --> 09:16.840
Oh, come on baby, come on, do it with me

09:42.840 --> 09:44.440
really loud into the mics tonight.

09:44.440 --> 09:45.440
Okay!

09:45.440 --> 09:46.440
Just like that.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.440
Good job.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.440
Can you hear us?

09:49.440 --> 09:50.440
Hi!

09:50.440 --> 09:54.960
So, uh, we apologize for the humming, but our, uh, my computer just sucks.

09:54.960 --> 09:58.040
I think they like it when you hum.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.480
Anyway, yes.

10:00.480 --> 10:09.200
I, uh, I dusted off that erotic, uh, promo because American Idol 2 premiered this week.

10:09.200 --> 10:13.240
I don't know if anybody out there gives a shit about American Idol anymore, but I watched

10:13.240 --> 10:14.240
it.

10:14.240 --> 10:17.880
American Idol makes me shit.

10:17.880 --> 10:21.040
I hate Irene, by the way, Elisa Jellman.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.040
That was funny.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.960
They had people on there that really suck.

10:24.960 --> 10:32.320
Like that guy that they're going to show next week, who's singing, oh fuck, but he's like

10:32.320 --> 10:33.320
a virgin.

10:33.320 --> 10:34.320
Yeah.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.320
Yeah.

10:35.320 --> 10:36.320
Like a virgin?

10:36.320 --> 10:37.320
No.

10:37.320 --> 10:38.320
You are a virgin.

10:38.320 --> 10:41.080
is going to touch you with a ten-foot pole.

10:41.080 --> 10:43.080
Okay?

10:43.080 --> 10:44.800
My god, it's like,

10:44.800 --> 10:47.840
let's get like some uh... cracked out baby,

10:47.840 --> 10:54.080
raise him up to be a pop idol, and put him on the show. Oh wait, now he's stupid.

10:54.080 --> 10:57.860
I love this American Idol 2 show because I like crap,

10:57.860 --> 11:01.260
and uh... there's just, there's a lot of really...

11:01.260 --> 11:05.040
I don't know, I think I'm sick or something because I love watching Simon

11:05.040 --> 11:12.040
here

11:12.760 --> 11:15.860
channel pound orange lounge is requesting our chat room by the way if

11:15.860 --> 11:19.420
you want to join our website orangelounge.skie.cx

11:19.420 --> 11:22.560
they're requesting a Hummer

11:22.560 --> 11:26.960
beautiful

11:26.960 --> 11:30.760
you know what we used to do, which is quite funny, we had this giant

11:30.760 --> 11:32.500
giant subwoofer

11:32.500 --> 11:34.600
at uh...

11:34.600 --> 11:39.240
and people used to sit on it and then we used to yell into the mic. Women liked it, I don't

11:39.240 --> 11:46.240
know. That was done on the Howard Stern movie. Yeah. Been there, done that high. Anyway,

11:46.240 --> 11:53.080
oh yeah, we were looking at the rating books. Damn you! We looked at the ratings books from

11:53.080 --> 11:58.200
last week's show, by the way, and I will be getting drunk on every episode now from here

11:58.200 --> 12:01.380
on out after that

12:01.380 --> 12:02.920
hope you guys enjoyed that

12:02.920 --> 12:06.980
although we did find out something. You're not going to be here for my junk show. I know I was just going to say we found out something a little

12:06.980 --> 12:11.220
unfortunate. I'm not going to be here for the President's Day show because that's the same weekend

12:11.220 --> 12:14.660
that's the same weekend as Cyberbeat Nation and I'll be down there

12:14.660 --> 12:17.880
Screw that tournament, this is my 5 year anniversary

12:17.880 --> 12:23.300
I think you already gave an F.U. to that tournament a few weeks ago. I'm going to give it another one, so fuck it

12:23.300 --> 12:24.560
alright

12:24.560 --> 12:35.680
Anyway, as promised, we're going to start off tonight's show with a list-less segment,

12:35.680 --> 12:38.440
because we usually do it at the end of the show, but tonight we're going to do it at

12:38.440 --> 12:41.340
the beginning of the show, because we want to talk about something that's going on right

12:41.340 --> 12:46.720
now, right this very minute that is preventing our usual amounts of listeners from turning

12:46.720 --> 12:48.260
out in droves.

12:48.260 --> 12:50.600
What's going on, Jamie?

12:50.600 --> 12:53.640
Other than you about ready to get whopped with this microphone?

12:53.640 --> 12:55.640
Fucking stupid bull.

12:56.640 --> 12:59.640
Oh, what's actually happening is, um...

13:00.640 --> 13:03.640
The raiders are sucking more ass than they've ever sucked in their ass.

13:03.640 --> 13:05.640
The raiders are bending over while...

13:05.640 --> 13:08.640
While the computer's headed to the violin.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.640
This is in their rectal cavity.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.640
And firing.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.640
Y'all just jealous.

13:16.640 --> 13:17.640
Because y'all...

13:17.640 --> 13:20.640
I wish I could lose by 30 points! Woo!

13:20.640 --> 13:25.640
I'm sorry, but at this point, the collective asshole of the Raiders is cavernous.

13:25.640 --> 13:28.640
Maybe I should go check out the scores. Maybe things turned around.

13:28.640 --> 13:29.640
You know what's funny?

13:29.640 --> 13:30.640
What, by two points, maybe?

13:30.640 --> 13:35.640
I wonder if there's going to be rioting in San Diego tonight when the Raiders lose really badly.

13:35.640 --> 13:42.640
Because, like, I don't know if you guys heard, but the whole town of San Diego was kind of bracing themselves for Raiders fans.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.640
Because San Diego is only about an eight hour drive from Oakland.

13:44.640 --> 13:48.640
So, you know, a lot of those insane people that like to burn things are going to drive down there.

13:48.640 --> 13:49.640
there

13:49.640 --> 13:50.640
so

13:50.640 --> 13:52.640
you're gonna be here in al-qaeda

13:52.640 --> 13:53.640
oh man

13:53.640 --> 13:54.640
i can't wait to see that

13:54.640 --> 13:55.640
they're gonna riot goodness

13:55.640 --> 13:57.200
they're gonna blame it on al-qaeda

13:57.200 --> 13:58.200
it's not big

13:58.200 --> 14:00.920
it's not oakland it's not san diego

14:00.920 --> 14:01.920
that's al-qaeda

14:01.920 --> 14:03.760
al-qaeda wanted the raiders to win

14:03.760 --> 14:05.760
but yeah

14:05.760 --> 14:06.760
yeah

14:06.760 --> 14:10.320
well i still stand by my word for it it's the stupid bull

14:10.320 --> 14:11.320
remember america

14:11.320 --> 14:12.880
although the commercials are pretty funny

14:12.880 --> 14:14.240
remember america

14:14.240 --> 14:16.440
if the raiders lose the terrorists win

14:16.440 --> 14:17.440
it.

14:17.440 --> 14:21.760
Um, see, this is what's going to happen, this is what's going to happen when the Raiders

14:21.760 --> 14:23.760
lose the Super Bowl.

14:23.760 --> 14:32.480
They're going to drop the bomb on the 10th day to go.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.480
Yeah, it was totally unnecessary.

14:34.480 --> 14:41.000
Anyway, oh yes, our list list, hi.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.720
We're going to be doing a list list tonight.

14:44.720 --> 14:48.860
Top three things, or top thing, because we do have one thing.

14:48.860 --> 14:53.240
Top things that we'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl.

14:53.240 --> 15:02.560
I just want you to stop.

15:02.560 --> 15:08.980
Yeah, so tonight's list list.

15:08.980 --> 15:11.500
three things we'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl except two of

15:11.500 --> 15:17.660
our guests just ran out of studio so we can't even but the way listless works we

15:17.660 --> 15:25.460
all will read our top three choices and then the fun part we have we have to go

15:25.460 --> 15:29.940
around the room and each person will remove one thing from that list they

15:29.940 --> 15:35.100
came up to took from 3 to 21 and 34 they're in the fourth quarter open oh my

15:35.100 --> 15:36.100
My Gods!

15:36.100 --> 15:37.100
They still have a chance.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.100
Yeah, whatever.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.100
I know none of you care!

15:39.100 --> 15:40.100
Anyway, um.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.100
Here we go.

15:41.100 --> 15:42.100
Somebody else got lazy.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.100
Anyway, yes, the topic.

15:43.100 --> 15:47.100
Top three things we'd rather be doing than watch the Super Bowl.

15:47.100 --> 15:53.340
Alright, and then the chat room, you guys will get to vote on what ends up being the

15:53.340 --> 15:54.820
ultimate list.

15:54.820 --> 15:57.140
If you want to vote, join our chat room now.

15:57.140 --> 16:04.140
Just go to our webpage at orangeloungelounge.skie.cx

16:27.140 --> 16:31.140
They had the Matrix commercial in there for the two new Matrix movies coming out.

16:31.140 --> 16:33.140
Pretty fucking cool guys.

16:33.140 --> 16:34.140
I'm excited.

16:34.140 --> 16:35.140
I'm wet.

16:35.140 --> 16:36.140
I'm sure they're already online.

16:36.140 --> 16:40.140
In fact, I think somebody in our channel, I think EOSFVB already has a copy of them.

16:40.140 --> 16:44.140
I'm seeing that movie at least eight times when it comes out.

16:44.140 --> 16:47.140
That's one thing about the Matrix movies, I can see them over and over again.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.140
I'm still entertained every time.

16:49.140 --> 16:51.140
It's like Jamie with Harry Potter.

16:51.140 --> 16:52.140
Yeah.

16:52.140 --> 16:56.140
Except Harry Potter doesn't do fucking martial arts and shit.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.140
It's cool. It's cool.

16:58.140 --> 17:00.140
That would be cool.

17:00.140 --> 17:02.140
Harry Potter!

17:02.140 --> 17:04.140
Did you know it was on...

17:04.140 --> 17:07.140
I think it's the smoking gun or something?

17:07.140 --> 17:09.140
Mm-mm.

17:09.140 --> 17:14.140
They had a drug bust of a shipment of SSC pills from...

17:14.140 --> 17:17.140
Yes, I did see that with a Harry Potter's logo.

17:17.140 --> 17:19.140
Yeah, with the big HP on them.

17:19.140 --> 17:21.140
Alright, anyway.

17:21.140 --> 17:23.140
Let's start. Let's read off our list.

17:23.140 --> 17:26.140
We'll start with Brad.

17:26.140 --> 17:28.140
Number three thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

17:28.140 --> 17:30.140
Good, because I know somebody else is already going to pick this.

17:30.140 --> 17:31.140
Playing 2DX.

17:31.140 --> 17:33.140
Playing 2DX.

17:33.140 --> 17:35.140
Damn.

17:35.140 --> 17:37.140
All right.

17:37.140 --> 17:40.140
Loki, your number three thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

17:40.140 --> 17:45.140
Since I really don't give a shit at all, I didn't even make a list, so I'm just going to pull random shit out of my head.

17:45.140 --> 17:46.140
All right, go for it.

17:46.140 --> 17:49.140
We'll go with number three with shaving a monkey.

17:49.140 --> 17:52.140
Shaving a monkey.

17:52.140 --> 17:54.540
seconds of fun till it poos on your face.

18:22.140 --> 18:29.140
My number three thing is having the rest of my wisdom teeth pulled while I'm awake.

18:30.980 --> 18:33.800
Having the rest of your wisdom teeth pulled while you're awake.

18:33.800 --> 18:38.300
I'll be numb, but I refuse to be put to sleep. They have to be done anyway. But I'm not going

18:38.300 --> 18:41.300
to let them put me to sleep. I'm just going to tell them to numb the fuck out of my mouth

18:41.300 --> 18:48.300
and I don't want an IV. If I got an IV, okay, my hand would be blue.

18:48.300 --> 18:52.300
I have a pocket, yeah I do have a pocket, I'm asleep.

18:52.300 --> 18:53.300
Anyway.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.300
Brad's amused by the pocket on my sleeve.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.300
Alright, so far so good.

18:56.300 --> 18:57.300
It's for your cigarettes, right?

18:57.300 --> 18:58.300
We got some beautiful choices.

18:58.300 --> 18:59.300
Wait, you know this one?

18:59.300 --> 19:02.300
Brad, number two thing you'd rather be doing than watch the Super Bowl?

19:02.300 --> 19:03.300
Winning the lottery.

19:03.300 --> 19:08.300
Winning the lottery!

19:08.300 --> 19:10.300
One thing that goes without saying, shit man.

19:10.300 --> 19:11.300
Great.

19:11.300 --> 19:14.300
I'd rather be winning the lottery than doing this show.

19:14.300 --> 19:18.300
Loki, the number two thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

19:18.300 --> 19:26.300
Well, this alludes to later on in the show, but watching Ally McFeel.

19:26.300 --> 19:34.300
Watching Ally McFeel, and if you want to know what the hell that is all about, then stay tuned after the next break.

19:34.300 --> 19:39.300
Alright, Ryan, the number two thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

19:39.300 --> 19:43.700
of a plug, but boy, I'd rather be working at GameStop in Arden Fair Mall, where you

19:43.700 --> 19:49.540
can reserve all your greatest new games coming out soon, like Legend of Zelda.

19:49.540 --> 19:51.340
Which I reserved the other day. If you don't reserve them there, I'll kill

19:51.340 --> 19:57.800
you, because my man is just lost. Alright, so working at GameStop at Arden

19:57.800 --> 20:00.160
Fair Mall. I'm trying to be my bitch forever.

20:00.160 --> 20:03.960
Are you sure you want the entire world, literally, because this is an international show, you

20:03.960 --> 20:09.240
want the entire world to know where you work? If you don't come and reserve things and be

20:09.240 --> 20:11.240
He eats me quite often.

20:11.240 --> 20:12.240
It hurts.

20:12.240 --> 20:13.240
Alright.

20:13.240 --> 20:15.400
But it's also entertaining to watch.

20:15.400 --> 20:20.920
Number two thing I would rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl, napping.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.920
Good call.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.920
I'd rather be taking a nap.

20:25.920 --> 20:26.920
Alright.

20:26.920 --> 20:30.280
Jamie, number two thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

20:30.280 --> 20:31.960
Buying more Propel.

20:31.960 --> 20:37.000
And drinking it.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Buying more Propel and drinking it.

20:39.000 --> 20:47.000
The number one thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.720
Jacking my hot spicy boner.

20:48.720 --> 20:56.360
Jacking my hot spicy boner.

20:56.360 --> 21:01.480
Loki, the number one thing that you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

21:01.480 --> 21:04.000
He took mine!

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
No, I have my own boner.

21:07.000 --> 21:23.000
Anyways, um, well shit, uh, no! Although, no, um, I'd rather be, uh, killing stupid

21:23.000 --> 21:27.360
people. Killing, killing stupid people. What? Wait, wait, wait, hold on. Maybe I'm just

21:27.360 --> 21:33.240
going to change that. Fine, how about this? Getting laid. There. Getting laid, alright.

21:33.240 --> 21:41.240
Alright, Ryan, you're number one thing you'd rather be doing than what you're supposed to be.

21:41.240 --> 21:44.240
I gotcha, I'll be. I'm totally going to win this vote here.

21:44.240 --> 21:53.240
Big black cock! B-I-G-B-L-A-C-K-C-O-C-K, people! Big black cock!

21:53.240 --> 21:55.240
That was really gay.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.240
So you'd rather be doing A big black cock?

21:57.240 --> 21:58.240
That's gay.

21:58.240 --> 22:04.240
I'm not doing it. It's just, they're, just, just quit it, just quit it.

22:04.240 --> 22:08.240
He just wants it to exist instead of it being capable.

22:08.240 --> 22:11.240
There shall be a big black cock for the masses.

22:11.240 --> 22:17.240
And all shall worship it and be happy. And lo, God was pleased by a big black cock.

22:17.240 --> 22:20.240
Blasphemy. Blasphemy.

22:20.240 --> 22:24.240
My number one thing that I put was masturbating.

22:24.240 --> 22:29.300
That was not actually a stress of PM to me that I should say that and I actually already had it written down come on

22:29.300 --> 22:33.540
You people know me. I put masturbating unfortunately. That's kind of already on the list, so I'll say

22:37.180 --> 22:41.780
Mine was a hot spicy boners yours could be here could be mild. No. I think I'm gonna change it

22:41.780 --> 22:46.080
I would say rather than the Super Bowl. I would rather get fucked up the ass

22:46.080 --> 23:00.600
ass. So I'm putting, get fucked up the ass. Hmm. We could arrange this. And you know what?

23:00.600 --> 23:05.840
That's not a gay thing. It's just, seriously, I, even if I were straight, I'd rather be

23:05.840 --> 23:09.240
getting fucked up the ass than watching the Super Bowl. I think you're infringing on the

23:09.240 --> 23:14.240

23:14.240 --> 23:17.080
how about how about you know what

24:36.340 --> 24:38.620
Anyway, let's get to the elimination round.

24:38.620 --> 24:39.460
Where's Brad?

24:39.460 --> 24:40.300
Brad!

24:42.300 --> 24:43.140
Ah!

24:44.700 --> 24:46.660
Beware, I live.

24:46.660 --> 24:47.500
Okay.

24:47.500 --> 24:48.320
Yeah!

24:48.320 --> 24:49.160
My hunger!

24:49.160 --> 24:50.000
Yeah!

24:50.000 --> 24:50.980
This has to come off the list.

24:50.980 --> 24:51.820
Yeah!

24:51.820 --> 24:55.820
One of these has to come off the list.

25:02.820 --> 25:04.820
I'm not a big fan of the big black cock.

25:04.820 --> 25:09.820
Oh, big black cock! First thing to go from the list.

25:10.820 --> 25:12.820
Do not attack me while holding the microphone.

25:12.820 --> 25:15.820
Don't pick on Brad, I would have taken it off too.

25:16.820 --> 25:19.820
Alright, Brad's taken off big black cock.

25:19.820 --> 25:23.820
Loki, one of these has to come off the list.

25:23.820 --> 25:28.820
Um, as much of a fan as I am of pain.

25:28.820 --> 25:32.820
Wait, no I'm not. So, wisdom teeth pulling while awake is coming off the list.

25:32.820 --> 25:33.820
It doesn't hurt.

25:33.820 --> 25:34.820
Alright.

25:34.820 --> 25:37.820
I fell asleep.

25:37.820 --> 25:39.820
I fell asleep when my wisdom teeth was pulled.

25:39.820 --> 25:40.820
Where's Ryan?

25:40.820 --> 25:41.820
I'm afraid of the dentist, so there.

25:41.820 --> 25:44.820
Ryan, something's gotta come off this list.

25:44.820 --> 25:58.820
Um, hmm. Well there's no really, any other, much other reasons to go to Scandia rather than 2DX and Xtreme, and 2DX is already on the list, so I'm going to remove Go to Scandia.

25:58.820 --> 25:59.820
Hey!

25:59.820 --> 26:00.820
Alright, fine.

26:00.820 --> 26:01.820
We love Scandia.

26:01.820 --> 26:12.820
Um, I'm going to take off the list, I'm going to take off watching Ally McFeel, as great as that porno is, we haven't even talked about it yet, so there's no way in hell it's going to get a vote anyway, so it's kind of pointless.

26:12.820 --> 26:16.820
Being the token female, I'm going to take off the hot spicy boner.

26:16.820 --> 26:19.820
I simply don't have one to know what the experience is like.

26:19.820 --> 26:25.820
I'd just like to point out that through all the guys in this room, getting fucked up the ass remained on the list.

26:25.820 --> 26:29.820
So, like I said, it's not a gay thing.

26:29.820 --> 26:35.820
It's just funny sounding, and we'll get votes and we won't have to win because it's funny and random.

26:35.820 --> 26:36.820
Yeah.

26:36.820 --> 26:37.820
Alright.

26:37.820 --> 26:38.820
She likes it in the ass.

26:38.820 --> 26:47.820
So, these are your choices, and you can send me your votes right now in private message in the chat room, or you can send them over email to orangelaunchradio.com, but you better do it now!

26:47.820 --> 26:52.820
Jamie, tell us, what are the things that they can vote on that they'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

26:52.820 --> 27:07.820
Playing 2DX, shaving a monkey, fixing Ryan's stupid fucking PS2, winning the lottery, working at Gamestop at Arden Fair Mall, napping, buying more Propel and drinking it, getting laid, getting fucked up the ass,

27:07.820 --> 27:11.820
Yes, and naming ponies on Derby Owners Club.

27:37.820 --> 27:38.820
I don't think I have it.

27:38.820 --> 27:39.820
You should do because I gave it to you.

27:39.820 --> 27:40.820
Okay, what?

27:40.820 --> 27:41.820
What's on here?

27:41.820 --> 27:42.820
I don't know.

27:42.820 --> 27:43.820
I don't remember.

27:43.820 --> 27:48.820
I'll look for dynamite, but it's probably on one of your pre-show discs, huh?

27:48.820 --> 27:50.820
No, I actually gave it to you.

27:50.820 --> 27:51.820
I gotta find it.

27:51.820 --> 27:54.820
I don't know if I copied it to my drive.

27:54.820 --> 27:57.820
It is an old pre-show.

27:57.820 --> 27:59.820
Last week's pre-show.

27:59.820 --> 28:09.100
Put this in and we'll find a song to play for you lovely people.

28:09.100 --> 28:13.740
So we're going to play Big Black Cock.

28:13.740 --> 28:19.260
Loading, loading, loading, loading away.

28:19.260 --> 28:20.900
Did my Winamp freeze?

28:20.900 --> 28:21.900
That would really suck.

28:21.900 --> 28:22.900
No it didn't, good.

28:22.900 --> 28:23.900
Okay.

28:23.900 --> 28:24.900
Okay, what do we hear?

28:24.900 --> 28:25.900
So what do we hear?

28:25.900 --> 28:26.900
Uhhhhhhhhhhh.

28:26.900 --> 28:30.960
Bitch this is cool but it's not crappy.

28:30.960 --> 28:33.500
I didn't put any crappy shit on here.

28:33.500 --> 28:35.360
How about this Upside Down remix?

28:35.360 --> 28:37.320
That's the Eurobeat version of Upside Down.

28:37.320 --> 28:38.320
That would be pretty gay.

28:38.320 --> 28:39.320
We'll hear that.

28:39.320 --> 28:40.320
Alright.

28:40.320 --> 28:43.980
Alright, we'll be right back to reveal the top list of things we'd rather be doing than

28:43.980 --> 28:44.980
watching the Super Bowl.

28:44.980 --> 28:45.980
Here we go!

28:45.980 --> 29:08.860
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh oohOWOWOWOOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW metres

29:08.860 --> 29:13.860
upside down, it's falling to the ground

29:13.860 --> 29:17.860
you can let go of it, you can let the things in

29:17.860 --> 29:20.860
upside down, now you're running all around

29:20.860 --> 29:23.860
look who are you dancing, look who are you feeling

29:23.860 --> 29:26.860
you look together, broken up your fever

29:26.860 --> 29:29.860
so you're never feeling good

29:29.860 --> 29:33.860
focus, let it be me, hear the people singing

29:33.860 --> 29:36.860
everybody take your hand

29:36.860 --> 29:42.860
I'm rowing on the ceiling, rowing by your feelings, rowing on the ceiling again

29:42.860 --> 29:46.860
Move your boots and don't makeover, keep your feet a lover,

29:46.860 --> 29:48.860
Why don't you stop from juicing your head?

29:48.860 --> 29:52.860
Ooh, I wanna see you, but it could seem a sin

29:52.860 --> 29:56.380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

30:22.860 --> 30:31.860
He knew that his heart was healing, if it hurts enough, he could try again.

30:31.860 --> 30:35.860
But when she caught his eye, ain't no man could fight the feeling.

30:35.860 --> 30:42.860
He knew he had to try to let love in, not to let her know, she was in the mood for talking.

30:42.860 --> 30:49.860
So when he began to play the game, before he knew it he had told her how much he'd been hurting.

30:49.860 --> 30:53.220
How he was hoping she was not the same

30:53.220 --> 30:56.340
Could you see the kind of way we're gonna make it?

30:56.340 --> 30:59.620
After all of this time, could it be true love?

30:59.620 --> 31:03.540
And she says, boy, you don't have to love no more

31:03.540 --> 31:07.700
I'll give the love you need till you holler in love, guaranteed

31:07.700 --> 31:10.820
I like the look, boy, I'm a tight lady

31:10.820 --> 31:13.860
You've been hurt, but be sure why I am the cure

31:13.860 --> 31:17.620
And when you wake up late thinking it's a dream

31:17.620 --> 31:21.620
Just don't stay for you, no, you can tell on me, believe me

31:21.620 --> 31:24.620
Baby, that little lady, you know what she found in me

31:24.620 --> 31:28.620
Is a lady, that kind of lady, that can give you what you need

31:28.620 --> 31:31.620
Baby, that kind of lady, that can never leave you lonely

31:31.620 --> 31:36.620
Is a lady, that kind of lady, finally got me all right, baby

31:36.620 --> 31:50.620
I've been waiting them all Late at night when you're all alone

31:50.620 --> 31:55.620
Hard to take, pick up the phone But here belongs to someone else

31:55.620 --> 32:00.620
You want to keep this love all for yourself You think you're being laid to sleep and die

32:00.620 --> 32:07.620
Standing in love is so hard to find Gotta keep an eye on myself, don't wanna share it with anybody else

32:07.620 --> 32:17.620
No one knows what goes on when we are all alone I know what I feel is so surreal

32:17.620 --> 32:22.620
We are sacred lovers Hope no one lets go inside

32:22.620 --> 32:26.620
See your everyday secret hideaway just around the way

32:26.620 --> 32:29.620
If you love us, then make us

32:29.620 --> 32:32.620
No one else I see, I will never see

32:32.620 --> 32:34.620
What we have to bring

32:34.620 --> 32:36.620
A secret rendezvous

32:36.620 --> 32:39.620
I love you, love

32:39.620 --> 32:41.620
You're the hand of the man

32:41.620 --> 32:43.620
Baby, I want you to know I need you

32:43.620 --> 32:45.620
Don't you know I need you here

32:45.620 --> 32:47.620
And I know

32:47.620 --> 32:49.620
You can whip my baby

32:49.620 --> 32:51.620
You can don't send me in

32:51.620 --> 32:53.620
The only way we can

32:53.620 --> 32:54.620
Is a fantasy

32:54.620 --> 32:55.620
Only you will need

32:55.620 --> 33:25.540
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

33:25.540 --> 33:29.540
Because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

33:55.540 --> 33:57.540
They make it chocolate coated and it's yummy.

33:59.540 --> 34:00.540
Get in here!

34:12.540 --> 34:13.540
Jacking my hot spicy.

34:13.540 --> 34:15.540
No. Jackie, my hot spicy boner, was taken off the list. I'm sorry.

34:15.540 --> 34:16.540
Winning the lottery.

34:16.540 --> 34:19.540
Winning the lottery was your number three pick.

34:19.540 --> 34:20.540
Did you win yet?

34:20.540 --> 34:22.540
I won a ticket.

34:22.540 --> 34:23.540
Alright.

34:23.540 --> 34:28.540
Your number two pick for things you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl is...

34:28.540 --> 34:30.540
Buying more Propel and drinking it.

34:30.540 --> 34:33.540
Yay! Buying more Propel and drinking it.

34:33.540 --> 34:35.540
And in honor of Propel.

34:40.540 --> 34:41.540
Alright.

34:41.540 --> 34:50.540
And the number one thing y'all would rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl is playing 2DX.

34:50.540 --> 34:57.540
So there you have it. I'm really disappointed that getting fucked up the ass and getting laid and all the sexual stuff was lose.

34:57.540 --> 35:00.540
I'm starting to think your audience is a bunch of fucking weirdos.

35:00.540 --> 35:06.540
If they think that winning the lottery is not as good as these other things.

35:06.540 --> 35:09.540
Okay, if you win the lottery you can buy sex.

35:09.540 --> 35:11.540
Winning lottery should be up there at the top.

35:11.540 --> 35:15.540
Yeah, but after winning the lottery, you can buy Propel and drink it, too.

35:15.540 --> 35:18.540
You can buy, like, vast amounts of Propel.

35:18.540 --> 35:21.540
If you won the lottery, you could get all of those things.

35:21.540 --> 35:23.540
And my spicy boner.

35:23.540 --> 35:25.540
And you could buy it to the X machine.

35:25.540 --> 35:27.540
Whoo! Or lots of tokens.

35:27.540 --> 35:29.540
You could probably buy Scandi.

35:29.540 --> 35:31.540
There you go, buy Scandi.

35:31.540 --> 35:33.540
Don't worry, Keith, if we buy Scandi, we'll still keep your top.

35:33.540 --> 35:35.540
Yeah, you can stay employed at Scandi.

35:35.540 --> 35:37.540
Anyway, actually what I think we should do is buy Golf Land,

35:37.540 --> 35:42.540
Fire all the management, and then turn it into a strip club.

35:42.540 --> 35:44.540
Yee-haw!

35:44.540 --> 35:46.540
Yeah!

35:46.540 --> 35:49.540
No, we turned half of it into a strip club and the other half into a better arcade.

35:49.540 --> 35:51.540
Yeah, where they would have upskirt DDR.

35:51.540 --> 35:53.540
Upskirt DDR. Upskirt DDR.

35:53.540 --> 35:59.540
I like the idea of an all-nude water park. Let's just turn Golf Land into a nudist colony.

35:59.540 --> 36:02.540
Wait! Nudist colony with one little thing.

36:02.540 --> 36:07.540
and it's got to be no, like they have, you know, welcomes all sorts of life, da da da da da, star.

36:07.540 --> 36:16.540
No ugly people! This includes you, fat people, and you over 40 people, and you that apply to both of those.

36:16.540 --> 36:21.540
No ugly people allowed. Period.

36:21.540 --> 36:26.540
They have a pre-screening for this? You have to, like, pass the test.

36:26.540 --> 36:28.540
Yes, and Jamie and I are the pre-screeners.

36:28.540 --> 36:41.540
Here's the thing, it's going to have a few tests. First, it's going to be a slightly small doorway. If you can't fit through the doorway, you're not allowed to go in there first off.

36:41.540 --> 36:49.540
Number two, it's going to have maybe some sort of small animal, like a monkey or something. You scare the monkey, you don't come in.

36:49.540 --> 36:56.120
No, no, I'll just bring Shermy.

36:56.120 --> 36:58.080
If Shermy doesn't like you, leave.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.080
Exactly.

36:59.080 --> 37:04.300
If she doesn't roll over and show you her belly, then you suck.

37:04.300 --> 37:08.760
If she doesn't wave her genitalia at you, then there's something wrong.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.720
No smelly people either, because there's some smelly people that go to golf land to play

37:11.720 --> 37:13.560
guitar freaks.

37:13.560 --> 37:16.800
One of them better be listening right now, because I'm going to tell you right now, fucking

37:16.800 --> 37:17.800
wash your ass.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.080
No sweaty balls and no unwashed twat.

37:20.080 --> 37:21.080
Shwetty balls.

37:21.080 --> 37:22.080
Shwetty balls.

37:22.080 --> 37:23.080
Unwashed twat.

37:23.080 --> 37:24.080
Hey, Ryan.

37:24.080 --> 37:27.080
Come talk to us about your unwashed twat.

37:27.080 --> 37:29.960
Do you have an unwashed twat, Ryan?

37:29.960 --> 37:32.360
Has feminine odor and itching got you down?

37:32.360 --> 37:36.520
Are you feeling not so fresh?

37:36.520 --> 37:37.520
Try Vagisil.

37:37.520 --> 37:42.320
Why don't you check on Vagiclean?

37:42.320 --> 37:45.360
It's so hard when you just walk into a room and you're getting...

37:45.360 --> 37:46.360
Not hard!

37:46.360 --> 37:47.360
Not hard!

37:47.360 --> 37:48.360
I hate you all.

37:48.360 --> 37:49.360
I hate you all.

37:49.360 --> 37:50.360
We love you.

37:50.360 --> 37:51.360
Meatballs and douche, yes.

37:51.360 --> 37:52.360
Meatballs and douche.

37:52.360 --> 37:53.360
Now, wait a minute.

37:53.360 --> 37:54.360
Now, hold on, hold on.

37:54.360 --> 37:55.360
Hold up for a minute here.

37:55.360 --> 37:58.360
Mabel's in the chat room and he's crying because he's claiming that he's fat and ugly and if

37:58.360 --> 38:00.360
he was over 40 he wouldn't be able to get in.

38:00.360 --> 38:01.360
You are neither.

38:01.360 --> 38:02.360
No, you're not fat or ugly.

38:02.360 --> 38:03.360
You can come to our nudist colonies.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.360
All right.

38:04.360 --> 38:11.360
Maples in the chat room and he's crying because he's claiming that he's fat and ugly and if he was over 40 he wouldn't be able to get in.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.360
You were neither!

38:13.360 --> 38:17.360
No, you're not fat or ugly, you can come to our nudist colony, so quit whining.

38:19.360 --> 38:23.360
Wait, there's a second rule to this. It's called the pimp factor, okay?

38:23.360 --> 38:29.360
You can look like whatever you want, but as long as you bring like at least fine, really fine honeys in, you're okay.

38:29.360 --> 38:37.360
We need to have a room with really, really pretty men going at it so I can watch them.

38:37.360 --> 38:39.360
Wait a minute though, no one under 18? Sorry.

38:39.360 --> 38:40.360
No one under 18.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.360
Yeah, sorry, we just can't have that. Sorry guys.

38:42.360 --> 38:44.360
But I need the happy room.

38:44.360 --> 38:48.360
We do like all our under 18 fans because we know we have a lot of under 18 people listening to what we're talking about.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.360
We can't get in trouble, sorry guys.

38:50.360 --> 38:53.360
I want the happy room though. I have to have the happy room.

38:53.360 --> 38:54.360
They just have to tell us.

38:54.360 --> 38:56.360
And then I can videotape it and sell it.

38:56.360 --> 39:04.360
It could be like Beavis and Butthead. You must be over 18 to be able to shoot Skeet. Are you guys over 18?

39:04.360 --> 39:12.360
Uh, no. Are you guys over 18? Yes. Okay, you can just... see, there you go.

39:12.360 --> 39:15.360
Okay, okay, that'll work. That'll work. That's fine.

39:15.360 --> 39:22.360
If you say you're under 18, you can't get in, but if you say you're over 18, then, you know, hey, we were only going off what you said, so...

39:22.360 --> 39:26.660
I want the happy room.

39:26.660 --> 39:31.920
You know, we could actually just turn it into a porn studio and then we would like pay for

39:31.920 --> 39:32.920
everything that way.

39:32.920 --> 39:34.920
Because porn is really cheap to make.

39:34.920 --> 39:41.160
All you need is a video camera and like one of those handheld spotlights.

39:41.160 --> 39:46.680
You don't even need a script to say, hey you, fuck, and then make something up.

39:46.680 --> 39:50.380
Speaking of pornography, thank you for that lovely transition.

39:50.380 --> 39:51.380
How was your week?

39:51.380 --> 39:53.380
What is your week looking?

39:53.380 --> 39:55.380
How is your week looking?

39:55.380 --> 39:57.380
Frustrating. Very frustrating.

39:57.380 --> 39:59.380
Why is that, your girlfriend out of town or something?

39:59.380 --> 40:01.380
No.

40:01.380 --> 40:03.380
She's not pregnant, is she?

40:03.380 --> 40:05.380
No, she's not pregnant.

40:05.380 --> 40:07.380
My girlfriend's okay.

40:07.380 --> 40:09.380
I'm frustrated because of my computer.

40:09.380 --> 40:12.380
It was out of commission for most of this week.

40:12.380 --> 40:15.380
Which also explains why my website is still not up yet.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.380
Dope.

40:17.380 --> 40:26.780
No, I was trying to, yet again, trying to crack the DDR Extreme disc, so in which case,

40:26.780 --> 40:33.500
I was, you know, I thought for some reason, actually, I figured out where everything is

40:33.500 --> 40:39.460
on the disc, and, what the fuck is so funny?

40:39.460 --> 40:40.460
It's not you, sorry.

40:40.460 --> 40:41.460
I just showed Jamie something I talked to somebody.

40:41.460 --> 40:43.460
Who is touching Jamie in there?

40:43.460 --> 40:45.380
Stop it!

40:45.380 --> 40:49.460
I was having a laugh at somebody's expense.

40:49.460 --> 40:51.900
No, no, we'll tell you guys during the video.

40:51.900 --> 40:54.020
So anyways, I was...

40:54.020 --> 40:56.080
This is very distracting, you guys.

40:56.080 --> 40:59.200
Sorry.

40:59.200 --> 41:01.800
So, I was trying to install Linux on my computer.

41:01.800 --> 41:05.760
I borrowed a couple copies of Linux from our friend Keith,

41:05.760 --> 41:08.500
and I was installing them on my computer.

41:08.500 --> 41:12.540
Well, you know, the damn thing didn't want to install for some reason. The installation program

41:12.540 --> 41:17.260
thought it knew how to partition my drives better than I did, and so it was a pain in

41:17.260 --> 41:21.780
the ass for about three days, and then finally I went out and bought Linux and saw that everything's

41:21.780 --> 41:27.540
fine, but now I can't do what I wanted it to do in the first place, which was, um, I've

41:27.540 --> 41:32.460
got, okay, basically here's the situation. I've got on the arcade disk for DDR Extreme,

41:32.460 --> 41:36.860
there's a bunch of files on there. Now, they're images of actual, um, of the flashcards that

41:36.860 --> 41:41.100
it flashes. So basically it copies this image to the flashcard, but in the images themselves

41:41.100 --> 41:45.420
are actually file trees, you know, with a bunch of different folders and files with

41:45.420 --> 41:50.260
them. And they're all Linux based. So what I was hoping to do is take, you know, Linux,

41:50.260 --> 41:55.140
be able to open these image files and view the individual files themselves. Because I

41:55.140 --> 41:59.500
know where all the data files are, I know where all the graphics files are, all the

41:59.500 --> 42:04.900
freaking movie files, everything. I just don't know how to open them. That's it. So that

42:04.900 --> 42:10.540
was my week. Exciting. No, it's not. You're right, it's not. Anyway.

42:10.540 --> 42:20.780
My week was pretty good. I napped a lot, and I went out and did stuff. But last night was

42:20.780 --> 42:25.760
entertaining. We were over here at my house, and one of the other hobbies that I participate

42:25.760 --> 42:31.160
in is I'm in the local Rocky Horror Picture Show cast. So, speaking of which, if any of

42:31.160 --> 42:35.320
you guys are in Orange Lounge World Headquarters in Sacramento, California, come on down to

42:35.320 --> 42:39.400
the Metro on February 8th, because we're doing the Rocky Horror Picture Show. That's downtown

42:39.400 --> 42:43.440
on K Street Vivids. Visit furtherindignities.com for more information.

42:43.440 --> 42:47.960
I volunteered to be a prop. I volunteered to be a prop.

42:47.960 --> 42:54.720
Yes, and Jamie's on the cast too, so we were here participating in the Rocky Horror rehearsal

42:54.720 --> 43:01.520
last night, and somebody brought to cast rehearsal for Irene some pornography, some fine pornography,

43:01.520 --> 43:09.240
And there was this porno called Ally McFeel, and Irene was a dumb bitch, of course, and

43:09.240 --> 43:21.040
left it here.

43:21.040 --> 43:24.120
So what happened last night, we were bored, and we went out to dinner.

43:24.120 --> 43:29.120
We went out to the Lions, and after we came back from Lions, Jamie and I were bored, so

43:29.120 --> 43:33.080
We decided we'd watch this porno, Ally McBeal, and it's great.

43:33.080 --> 43:34.080
It's fucking great.

43:34.080 --> 43:38.040
We wanted to play a clip from it for you guys, because basically the way it is, it's set

43:38.040 --> 43:39.040
up.

43:39.040 --> 43:40.040
How did it start?

43:40.040 --> 43:44.540
It starts with this woman, and she's masturbating with a huge dildo, and the dildo explodes

43:44.540 --> 43:48.160
inside her, basically, in her cavernous pussy.

43:48.160 --> 43:52.840
She has this huge pussy, it's huge, and the dildo explodes, so she decides she's going

43:52.840 --> 43:57.200
to sue the toy company, and basically, just like on the real show, Ally McBeal, when they

43:57.200 --> 44:00.320
they go to the law firm, all the lawyers and everybody, they're all fucking each other

44:00.320 --> 44:02.640
basically.

44:02.640 --> 44:07.520
So then we have the big trial, the big trial comes later, and we wanted to play a clip

44:07.520 --> 44:09.280
from the trial for you guys.

44:09.280 --> 44:13.680
We have Johnny Cochran, who is...

44:13.680 --> 44:14.680
I have to giggle.

44:14.680 --> 44:17.120
Yeah, she gave him her panties at the beginning of the video.

44:17.120 --> 44:20.640
Yes, we have Johnny Cochran, and Ally McPheil gave Johnny Cochran her panties.

44:20.640 --> 44:22.040
He sniffed them and put them in his jacket.

44:22.040 --> 44:25.240
Yeah, and he sniffed them and put them in his jacket, and he's basically the lawyer

44:25.240 --> 44:28.520
supporting the woman who had the dildo explode inside of her.

44:28.520 --> 44:29.520
The Australian woman.

44:29.520 --> 44:34.920
Yes, and Ally McFeel, her client is the company that made the exploding dildo.

44:34.920 --> 44:37.280
Who, by the way, fucks the other person in the room.

44:37.280 --> 44:40.120
Yeah, who, by the way, fucks the chick with the cavernous pussy in the beginning.

44:40.120 --> 44:41.120
She knows how to use the dildo.

44:41.120 --> 44:44.520
But anyway, yeah, to see if she really knows how to use the dildo, you know, kind of an

44:44.520 --> 44:45.520
instruction manual.

44:45.520 --> 44:50.080
So, anyway, we're going to play a clip from this fabulous porno, which, by the way, also

44:50.080 --> 44:52.240
guest stars Ron Jeremy.

let's try this again

46:18.360 --> 46:23.360
This offending instrument was manufactured by Mr. Boner's company.

46:23.360 --> 46:27.360
Objection! My client's name is Boner.

46:27.360 --> 46:32.360
As in Christ, I'd like to bone her a tight little asshole with my big black cock.

46:32.360 --> 46:35.360
Ms. Macphiel, you're walking a tight line here.

46:35.360 --> 46:41.360
Counsel will not refer to defendant as Boner.

46:41.360 --> 46:47.360
Mr. Boner's company may as well manufacture this defective dildo.

46:47.360 --> 46:49.960
It apparently damages my clients genitalia.

46:49.960 --> 46:51.960
Emotional physical harm has set in.

46:51.960 --> 46:53.960
Chicken...

46:53.960 --> 46:55.960
...tokus pokus...

46:55.960 --> 46:57.960
...is yes.

46:57.960 --> 46:59.960
Judge, I ask you.

46:59.960 --> 47:01.960
Do the right thing.

47:01.960 --> 47:03.960
If the dildos is not fit...

47:03.960 --> 47:05.960
...then they are not legit.

47:05.960 --> 47:08.960
Big black cock.

47:08.960 --> 47:10.960
We were just really excited

47:10.960 --> 47:12.960
and Jamie and I started wetting our pants

47:12.960 --> 47:14.960
when she said big black cock.

47:14.960 --> 47:20.960
The little gear started turning in Rob's head as he thought, how am I going to pass it?

47:20.960 --> 47:23.960
Dude, that's it! Dude, I got the G!

47:23.960 --> 47:26.960
What is that bullshit?

47:26.960 --> 47:30.960
Maple missed it, so we have to play it again. Sorry, guys. Here we go.

47:30.960 --> 47:33.960
Hold on one more time. Instant replay.

47:33.960 --> 47:34.960
What class did it tell you?

47:34.960 --> 47:36.960
Oops, sorry. Let me get back here.

47:36.960 --> 47:38.960
La la la la la la la.

47:38.960 --> 47:39.960
It should be part of a new promo.

47:39.960 --> 47:44.960
This offending instrument was manufactured by Mr. Boner's company.

47:45.960 --> 47:48.960
Attention! My client's name is Bonher.

47:48.960 --> 47:53.960
As in Christ, I'd like to bone her tight little asshole with my big black cock.

48:18.960 --> 48:20.960
I'm just a big dick, you know, made up for it all.

48:23.960 --> 48:25.960
You sit there with this blank look on your face.

48:25.960 --> 48:28.960
Well, I haven't seen it. I just saw the few scenes.

48:28.960 --> 48:31.960
Yeah, you missed the big three-way lesbian scene, too.

48:31.960 --> 48:33.960
I was previewing Ally McField.

48:33.960 --> 48:38.960
I got one, though. It has, like, 50 black Nubian nurses and a giant gangbang.

48:38.960 --> 48:39.960
Does that count?

48:39.960 --> 48:40.960
What's a Nubian?

48:40.960 --> 48:42.960
Nubian is a shit.

48:42.960 --> 48:44.960
It's a joke. It's a joke from Chasing Gaming. Never mind.

48:44.960 --> 49:01.240
I thought that scene was funny, though, the one chick gets her teeth knocked out and he's

49:01.240 --> 49:05.720
all, ooh, a gummer, and then later on she gets her teeth back again, like, ooh, what

49:05.720 --> 49:07.200
happened there?

49:07.200 --> 49:10.900
This porno gets Orange Lounge's highest recommendation, by the way.

49:10.900 --> 49:11.900
Two dicks up.

49:11.900 --> 49:12.900
Way up.

49:12.900 --> 49:13.900
I want to see that other one.

49:13.900 --> 49:18.580
other porno we'll watch that a little later okay okay anyway so yeah oh yeah

49:18.580 --> 49:23.260

49:35.220 --> 49:40.940
about going to Scotland and the kilt cam military kilt cam there's nothing as

49:40.940 --> 49:46.900
as enjoyable as kilts worn the traditional way on a breezy day.

49:46.900 --> 49:47.900
You're a pervert.

49:47.900 --> 49:51.820
You know, that's really gotten me wondering about a lot of my town's folk.

49:51.820 --> 49:55.700
I got, you know, Bob the Cat, and he's wearing like a skirt throughout my town.

49:55.700 --> 49:57.260
I'm like, what the fuck's going on?

49:57.260 --> 49:58.260
Ooh!

49:58.260 --> 49:59.260
That's hot.

49:59.260 --> 50:00.260
Bob, you're a guy.

50:00.260 --> 50:03.180
You're supposed to be wearing guy clothes, not a skirt.

50:03.180 --> 50:08.220
There's this rhino in our town named Spike who has a band-aid on his face and he's all

50:08.220 --> 50:09.220
hardcore.

50:09.220 --> 50:16.420
a skull shirt and then one day he started wearing a blue moo moo with daisies on it.

50:16.420 --> 50:18.380
Your town makes people gay, remember?

50:18.380 --> 50:23.100
Yes, my town makes animals and the big ol' gays.

50:23.100 --> 50:24.660
My town is the gay!

50:24.660 --> 50:30.100
Well, you know there was the triangle with Dina and Goldie and then Goldie left her for

50:30.100 --> 50:31.100
Bobra.

50:31.100 --> 50:32.100
Oh my.

50:32.100 --> 50:38.740
Well, no, because we thought that Goldie was getting the twat action from Dina, you know,

50:38.740 --> 50:40.740
You know, because Dina has that big, long bill.

50:40.740 --> 50:43.740
And then, because she was saying sugar bill, like Dina says.

50:43.740 --> 50:48.740
And then, all of a sudden, she starts saying, I suck, like Barbara says, because we hate Barbara, and she says, I suck.

50:48.740 --> 50:49.740
Scandalous, scandalous.

50:49.740 --> 50:54.740
I think I'm just going to change what horns be when my town says no to my master again.

50:54.740 --> 50:58.740
I have one in my town, Cody. He says, you ass, after everything.

50:58.740 --> 50:59.740
So he goes, what's going on, you ass?

50:59.740 --> 51:03.740
I've got my, I've got, what was it, Ricky the squirrel or whatever.

51:03.740 --> 51:05.740
Oh, that little asshole that moved from my village.

51:05.740 --> 51:09.740
I changed his thing to say skanky hoe after everything he says.

51:09.740 --> 51:13.740
My girlfriend loves it.

51:13.740 --> 51:17.740
Does she enjoy my letter?

51:17.740 --> 51:21.740
She's like, why do you send me stuff?

51:21.740 --> 51:25.740
All the townsfolk don't understand anything I write them.

51:25.740 --> 51:29.740
I'm going to give you a big tip on Animal Crossing, everybody.

51:29.740 --> 51:33.740
If you want to get things from the villagers, write a full letter.

51:33.740 --> 51:35.740
six lines of letter to your villagers.

51:35.740 --> 51:37.740
All I do is,

51:37.740 --> 51:39.740
Dear so-and-so,

51:39.740 --> 51:41.740
You suck. I want you to die and go to hell.

51:41.740 --> 51:43.740
I hate your guts and I wish that you never moved to my village.

51:43.740 --> 51:45.740
Love, Sakura.

51:45.740 --> 51:47.740
And I get stuff from them.

51:47.740 --> 51:49.740
See, I wrote one to Cody that said,

51:49.740 --> 51:51.740
All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.

51:51.740 --> 51:53.740
All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.

51:53.740 --> 51:55.740
All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.

51:55.740 --> 51:57.740
And he sent me furniture.

51:57.740 --> 51:59.740
That's great!

51:59.740 --> 52:01.740
I got a letter from Goose today,

52:01.740 --> 52:05.740
I was about to say Shaky Trees and a furniture fell on my head.

52:05.740 --> 52:08.740
That was it. I was like, why are you sending me shit?

52:08.740 --> 52:10.740
I don't even want to talk to you, you dumb bitch.

52:10.740 --> 52:13.740
I like when they're giving you a tip, do you know how to catch fish yet?

52:13.740 --> 52:18.740
Well, I just gave you a fish, you jackass. Where do you think I got it from?

52:18.740 --> 52:22.740
You want to be slapped in the head by a wet trout. By the way, we can just slap somebody in the head.

52:22.740 --> 52:25.740
You want to slap people in the chatroom with wet trout? Okay, go for it.

52:25.740 --> 52:29.740
Well, you've got to click on their name first. Then you slap them. There you go.

52:29.740 --> 52:33.740
You just slapped 23rd Magus with a large trout. How was that?

52:33.740 --> 52:35.740
I'm going to slap somebody else.

52:35.740 --> 52:37.740
You're going to slap somebody else?

52:37.740 --> 52:41.740
All right!

52:41.740 --> 52:45.740
Why are you slapping myself?

52:45.740 --> 52:49.740
So, Jamie's having fun slapping people with trout.

52:49.740 --> 52:53.740
I'm sorry, hold on.

52:53.740 --> 52:57.740
Yeah, Ryan pointed out something. It says in God we trust in the thing, but it should say in God we thrust.

52:57.740 --> 53:03.920
thrust. Hey, you know what? There's scenes in here that never happened. These are just

53:03.920 --> 53:04.920
like promo pictures.

53:04.920 --> 53:08.280
Well, actually, I wanted to give out the website address if you guys want to order Ally McField

53:08.280 --> 53:10.760
because I really don't want to get sued by these people for playing a clip from their

53:10.760 --> 53:17.440
thing. It's passionpictures.com or you can visit hollywoodpornstars.com.

53:17.440 --> 53:24.960
Yeah, you don't want to get sued by this company yet you blatantly have. Oh, wait. Never mind.

53:24.960 --> 53:31.960
My mistake, we buy all those soundtracks.

53:32.680 --> 53:37.680
So Jamie's having fun slapping people in the chatroom with, uh, trouts.

53:37.680 --> 53:44.680
Good. Oh, I saw something funny on, uh, Saturday. Okay, so I was outside after playing a vigorous

53:46.240 --> 53:50.980
game of DDR Extreme and I was tired, you know, airing out my shoes and whatnot, and I'm watching

53:50.980 --> 53:56.200
in the batting cages. And stupid kid number one, and I love it when stupid people get

53:56.200 --> 54:00.380
punished, stupid kid number one decides, I'm going to go bat in the batting cage. And his

54:00.380 --> 54:04.480
little father, his father, there's no watching him and stuff. Well stupid fat chubby kid

54:04.480 --> 54:09.540
number one decides to try to hit the ball. Misses the ball, and so it hits the back little

54:09.540 --> 54:13.540
thing there. So stupid kid number one goes, dude, I'm going to pick up the ball and hit

54:13.540 --> 54:18.260
it. So he picks up the ball, stands back up, THWAP, in the back of his head with a 50 mile

54:18.260 --> 54:23.260
now her softball, and the stupid kid falls on the ground. I started busting out.

54:23.260 --> 54:28.260
We didn't look at the pictures on this board.

54:28.260 --> 54:30.260
I want to see the pictures!

Alright, never mind, I'll take that back. Instead of the cage match, we're going to do FUs of the Week.

55:21.160 --> 55:27.160
So send me your FUs of the Week over private message or over email to orangeloungeradio.yahoo.com

Um, well, let's see, what we're going to be playing on the break here is going to be two remix songs from, um, Club Mix.

55:35.160 --> 55:40.160
Actually, we've got Jam Jam Reggae, and we also have, um...

55:40.160 --> 55:41.160
Ska Go Go, right?

55:41.160 --> 55:42.160
Ska Go Go, yes.

55:42.160 --> 55:43.160
Cool.

55:43.160 --> 56:01.160
The first one is Jam Jam Reggae, the Jam Jam Mix remix by Good Cool, and the second one is actually remixed by the same group, or it's actually arranged by Ken Matsu somehow, I don't know, name gets cut off there, but anyways, it's cool, so, well let's see here.

56:01.160 --> 56:02.160
Matsu-Moto!

Matsu-Moto, so it's the Bald Heads remix by Ken Matsu-Moto, or whatever, and it's Scott Gogo, Get the Funk Out mix, so, enjoy.

56:12.160 --> 56:16.160
And war is breaking out in the chat room right now. I better go stop it.

57:42.160 --> 57:57.160
Are you ready for the game?

57:57.160 --> 58:00.160

58:30.160 --> 59:00.040
Uh, hi, we don't want dead air so I'm gonna find something to throw on real fast here.

59:00.040 --> 59:05.040

59:39.040 --> 59:42.040

59:42.040 --> 59:45.040
We don't stop, we rock the spot, no

59:45.040 --> 59:47.540
We don't quit, kick failure, this is it

If there's any real thing for you making me scream

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:42.540
Listen to Orange Jog's radio, where you can witness Rob be kicked off the ass by Brad.

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:48.540
Brad did a good job. All that Rob's asshole is quite large by now, like a mason jar.

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:54.540
You could hold strawberry preserves to Rob's rectum now, and have it tightly sealed.

01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:59.540
Yeah. Oh baby, I have the hugest...

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:04.540
I'm going to the kitchen and there's Rob's young Brad's ass.

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:08.540
Hey, it's not my fault all the boys and girls love me.

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:12.540
Who's Irene now?

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:16.540
Well, Irene was sitting on my lap. Ha ha ha!

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:20.540
Oh yes, shall we do the FUs of the week now?

01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:24.540
Would that be like an extension cord?

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:28.540
Blink blink blink.

01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:32.540
If you have an FU of the week you can send those over a private message or email.

01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:34.540
I want Teramix today.

01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:35.540
You want Teramix today?

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:36.540
Teramix.

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:38.540
Picky, picky, picky.

01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:40.540
Picky, picky, picky.

01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:41.540
Gross.

01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:43.540
That was a chocolate bar.

01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:44.540
Alright, let's have at it.

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.540
This burp was bought to you by Russell Stover Chocolate.

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:49.540
Beautiful.

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:51.540
Dude, you look like you're trying to deep throat this.

01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:58.540
This is fucked up.

01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.540
The first episode he goes to the soup bowl.

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:02.540
Yeah, I went to the soup bowl.

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.540
I think I caught a wreck of it.

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.540
I just gave it to them.

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:08.540
And they had their big, squeaky beak

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:10.540
going super over loud, and these guys

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:12.540
they're going, hooah!

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:14.540
The whole time.

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:16.540
This girl finally goes, hooah!

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:18.540
Listen to me!

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:20.540
I have a dick, hooah!

01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:22.540
Like that.

01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:24.540
So a sound clip for a future episode.

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.540
ahahaha

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:28.540
ahhhhh

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:30.540

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:32.540

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:42.540
next fuck you goes to rob

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:44.540
and brad

01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:46.540
and to pat

01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:48.540
and dan

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:50.540
wooooo

01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:52.540
this is jpmr

01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:57.540
I'm sorry, I'm from the U.S.

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:05.540
And my other fuck you to me goes toward America for being stupid.

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:15.540
Okay, what about American football has to do with using your feet, but kicking the ball, it happens like for what, one occurrence in the whole game?

01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:19.540
The whole having to run around and everything might have to be game to beat.

01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:26.540
You don't kick the ball. That's why soccer should be football. Like it is everywhere else in the god damn world.

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.540
I mean, it's not football.

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:30.540
No, no, no, no, no, no. It's a brand thing.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:31.540
Brand thing.

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:33.540
It's not called kickball.

01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:35.540
But here's the thing. Here's the thing though. I want to say.

01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:36.540
That they use their feet.

01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:39.540
The thing is that America doesn't give a shit about soccer.

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:40.540
Soccer is not...

01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:41.540
Soccer is cool.

01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:42.540
Soccer is not cool.

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:44.540
Soccer is not important in America.

01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:51.220
And by the way, American football is a rip-off of rugby, which is a much cooler, violent,

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:52.220
bloodier sport.

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:53.220
Because you know what?

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:56.900
There's something about, okay, first of all, there's the guys that play it.

01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:00.860
A lot of them are really nicely built, and don't look like they've been swallowing steroids

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:03.060
since they were two years old.

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:07.340
They don't have necks with the circumference of a watermelon.

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:08.340
Okay?

01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:14.340
They look like normal guys, and they're muscular, and they have a nice butt.

01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:17.340
And then they get all bloody, which is even better.

01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:18.340
Because Jimmy's got a dick.

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:20.340
Roar!

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:32.340
Mabel would like to add that soccer is only cool if you're playing Virtua Striker at MGL with another friend.

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:34.340
Um, no.

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:41.340
Although, and you know, it was really awesome, they even made it into like, I don't know if there was a box or something

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:46.340
where they had things being made and all of a sudden they were talking about it all over the place.

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:54.340
Um, what else do you think is fucked? I don't know. What else do you think is fucked?

01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:58.340
Not necessarily who needs to get fucked, but what needs to fuck you?

01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:12.340
Oh yeah, fuck me not having a way to get to Hayward next weekend, because Dan doesn't want me to drive my car to Hayward, because I just got it.

01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:21.340
I would also like to say that my CD player for the CDI retracts my CD to a weekly note.

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:26.340
What was the one that I was going to listen to from your album?

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:29.340
No. Um, wealth land?

01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:33.340
Um, I don't go there anymore.

01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:36.340
Is your brain free?

01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:38.340
I'm not the first person.

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:46.340
Um, I would like to, um, say thank you to my lack of, um, man sex.

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:47.340
Brain?

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:50.340
I don't have any man sex.

01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:53.340
You were asking for my brain earlier.

01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:55.340
And I need more doujinshi.

01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:59.340
Yeah. People find me, they'll get me and send it to me, okay?

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:02.340
And, um...

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:04.340
Um, yeah.

01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:06.340
Alright.

01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:09.340
Matt, give us your FUs of the Week.

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.340
Um, please.

01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:14.340
FU goes to Linux!

01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:17.340
Fuck you Linux, you're a stupid installer!

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:20.340
Work right for once, goddammit! You're free!

01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:22.340
You should be working!

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:29.340
I'll see here, I installed three versions of Linux this weekend, 7.1 decided G, I don't feel like I'm going to install at all,

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:35.340
because I'm going to tell you that your blank 20 gig hard drive has not enough space for me to install my stupid program.

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:45.340
So, then I tried installing Red Hat 7.0, got that working, and it's a Japanese copy! I can't read Japanese, so that's not going to do any good.

01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:49.340
And then finally installed Mandrake 6.4

01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:53.340
And, uh, well, you know what? That program's so old it doesn't run jack.

01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:57.340
It doesn't understand what my monitor is, it doesn't even know what my video card is, so

01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:00.340
it didn't do me any good, it's like installing Windows 3.0.

01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:04.340
So finally I got Linux, uh, what was it, Mandrake 9, that works fine.

01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:09.340
Except the fact that it's a stupid bootloader that puts it in there instead of the Windows bootloader.

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:14.340
It causes the program to make my Windows kinda glitch out a little bit every now and then.

01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:18.740
So that sucks, because I have to reinstall windows and not own this, so...

01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:23.140
Okay, um, other than that, F you too, the DMV.

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:30.140
Why the DMV? Because I can't attack the stupid drivers anymore because you're still stupid and nothing's gonna ever help you.

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:34.940
So I'm gonna yell at the DMV for letting you stupid drivers get on the road in the first place.

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:40.340
You're fucking stupid! Actually, you know, let people take the test and fail the test numerous times.

01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:50.340
I hate you! You're stupid! Part of the government, which makes you worse, because the government

01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:51.340
sucks.

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:52.340
Do I accept all that?

01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:53.340
Go ahead.

01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:56.340
Is it easy to let old people back through it?

01:07:56.340 --> 01:08:01.340
Yes. This also, you know, ends up being to old people.

01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:09.340
You know what? I think after a certain age, you outlive your usefulness and you should

01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:16.340
down

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:20.260
I hate to see now old people

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:21.860
they're stupid

01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:23.060
I hate em

01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:25.940
uh... actually also an f-cube for uh...

01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:27.460
reality tv shows

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:30.780
Hey! I love reality tv! Stop popping up like freaking

01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:32.380
I don't know what dammit

01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:33.900
it's like a fucking plague

01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:37.140
it's like I'm gonna turn on the t.v. Guess what we're gonna watch people

01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:40.740
keep themselves in the head guess what we're gonna watch brides get mad i agree you know

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:45.360
what that bridezilla man vs beast all that shit completely useless but surreal life best

01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:51.700
show ever but that bridezilla thing is the reason why i want to upload okay um i did

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:55.820
find it funny though that they had uh hundred mitch or like 50 mitch and pull a jet and

01:08:55.820 --> 01:09:02.580
had i guess the elephant because mitch pulling anything is funny but yeah so you watched

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:04.580
No, I saw the commercial.

01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:05.580
Oh.

01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:08.580
I watch the commercial!

01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:09.580
Yeah!

01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:16.580
Anyway, so, um, also another F.P. Decrouted arcade, because I don't like coin lines that are 16 coins long.

01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:25.580
One, no one can figure out what turn they're up, and also, um, I don't like waiting like 20 minutes between games, or half an hour or whatnot.

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:30.580
So, yeah, pretty weak, but that's my F.P. Decrouted.

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:40.580
Beautiful. My FU of the Week goes to Brad for making me late for that last segment so that Jamie could have her way with making fun of me.

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:50.580
And I would like to also give an FU to the coin line. I've ranted about this weeks ago. Completely useless. It's useless these days.

01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:56.580
Back in the days with Street Fighter when everybody would like watch everybody else play and stuff, it kept places a little better.

01:09:56.580 --> 01:10:02.100
better. When people use custom coins, I guess it kind of works, but the way it is now, it

01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:06.700
doesn't work. You need to sign up cheap. Fuck the coin line. I hate it. Stupid. I'm just

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:13.700
going to cut in front of everybody. Until you get a better system, I play first. Ow.

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:15.700
Oh! Hey, dammit!

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:21.700
Alright, uh, my other F.U. goes to, uh, Beat Horny! Yes!

01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:26.700
Alright, that's all my F.U.s.

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:30.700
Uh, let's go around the room and, alright, Jamie has one more.

01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:37.700
I have my other F.U. goes toward, um, not having a dual RX.

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:38.700
This is fucked up.

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:41.700
Because I want to play Strider and stuff like that. Thank you.

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:47.700
Thank you for sharing that. Let's go around the room and hear our guest's FUs of the Week.

01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:49.700
What are you handing me the mic for?

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:54.700
The only thing I gotta fuck you is, you know, as much as he's given the US lately,

01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:59.700
I'd like to put a fuck you out to Itagaki for completely lying to the US about DOA,

01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:04.700
extreme beach volleyball, and pushing back the next Virtua Cup for another year!

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.700
Fuck you!

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:08.700
FUs of the Week, Brad?

01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:10.700
My F.U. goes to drama, seriously.

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:11.700
I can't find my song. It's me arm.

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.700
And neck, neck.

01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:15.700
Shit. Oh well. I need some other time.

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:17.700
Neck, neck, neck, neck.

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:20.700
My love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love.

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:22.700
Oh well. Oh well.

01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:24.700
Oh well. A hopeless quest.

01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:26.700
Alright, let's read the chatroom FUs, shall we?

01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:27.700
Whoo!

01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:33.700
One, two, three, four, fuck.

01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:35.700
Fuck being tired? Fuck algebra?

01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:37.700
Two, that is. Fuck algebra two.

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:39.700
And fuck me for not being able to type.

01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:46.700
EOSFPB, fuck you to people with fuck yous. What do you have to be mad about? There's a new Matrix trailer.

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:54.700
Wait, I take that back. Fuck you to all the sportsbooks here who paid the raiders to throw the game after overly hyping how much ass the raiders were gonna kick ass.

01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.700
The house always wins because it keeps things stupid.

01:12:56.700 --> 01:13:04.700
What are you talking about there's nothing to be fucking mad about? The Matrix movie isn't hell yet, sew up the trailer. Is that the wait like three months for the movie?

01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:06.700
It's too long!

01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:13.700
Fuck the Daredevil movie. Ben Affleck will make a shitty Daredevil, and the chick they

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:21.040
got to play Elektra looks nothing like her. But I'm going to see it anyway. And fuck me

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:24.040
for wanting to see it.

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:31.040
Um, uh, um. Yeah, I mean, come on, Elektra is Asian. Her character's Asian. The chicken

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:35.640
alias is white. And not just white, it's trailer trash white.

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:37.640
We needed to get Tia Carrere to play our game.

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.640
Yeah, or Agent Carrere.

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.640
Tia Carrere is the shit.

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.640
She was on it.

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:45.640
I was thinking...

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:47.640
Means World is the shit. No, not Lucy Lu, man.

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.640
Ugh, Lucy Lu sucks.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:53.640
How about the chick from, um, um, Gretchen Taker didn't drag.

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:55.640
Oh, um, what?

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.640
Oh yeah, yeah, the one that was in Rush Hour 2.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.640
She would have been fucking awesome because she taught and she kicked ass.

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:01.640
She actually knows martial arts.

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:04.640
The chick in Alias is just a fucking little wannabe bitch.

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:08.640
I think we should have a later circuit, by the way, about Confucius.

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:13.640
You know what some people like to point out? Even if the chick that plays Elektra doesn't look like her, Jennifer Garner gots ass.

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:15.640
That ass could make J-Lo cry.

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:18.640
I'm sorry, you're desperate because she is fucking ugly.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.640
Elektra is Asian.

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.640
You are desperate.

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:26.640
Blueheimer wanted to share the trailer trash white would be a cool new Crayola cover.

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.040
hahahahaha

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:31.280
actually i'd rather see uh... found

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:32.880
as i heard

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.320
killed very violently

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:37.260
funny way

01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:40.060
funny death is always fun

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:43.120
except you know where i am going i'm not going to wonder

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:46.540
i'd like to have my uh... best friend from high school not literally

01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:50.780
but i'd like to send out an f you my best friend from high school because one day i was in a really shitty mood

01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:53.460
and he said i don't know how i'm going to cheer you up rob

01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:57.940
let's go to my house watch faces of death

01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:01.840
so we started watching faces of death and i'm sorry

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:04.420
you don't want to be already feeling sad

01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:06.420
it's hilarious what are you talking about?

01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:08.420
it's not hilarious, it's so hilarious

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:12.780
i love that one of the guys, the guy with the station wagon that puts a rocket on the back

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:17.980
and wings on it and flies over the river and explodes in the air, what a dumbass

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:21.980
I saw some guy who was skydiving and it gets eaten by a crocodile. It was disgusting.

01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:22.980
It was cool.

01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:24.980
No, it was gross.

01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:29.980
Actually, you know what horror movie had funny deaths?

01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:31.980
It was all the Nightmare on Elm Street movies.

01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:32.980
Yeah, Nightmare on Elm Street movies were all funny.

01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:33.980
That was funny deaths.

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:38.980
Movie funny deaths are cool because you always laugh and go, oh, how did they do that, you know,

01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:41.980
type thing, and oh, movie special effects are so funny.

01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:42.980
Like in the first...

01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:44.980
Like when Chick-Tick got turned into a cockroach.

01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:50.980
Or I'm thinking from the very first Final Destination, that chick that gets hit by the bus, I laughed so fucking hard. Anyway.

01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:56.980
Alright, moving on. Back to the chatroom, here we go.

01:15:58.980 --> 01:15:59.980
Whack-whap!

01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:02.980
Uh, fuck you to Chat Cookie.

01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:09.980
Fuck the Raiders, they suck. Fuck the UC Davis IT people for taking two weeks to fix the connection in the dorm.

01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:12.980
Fuck the fact that I still haven't played 2DX Escandia yet.

01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:17.980
Fuck the fact that no one responded to my post in comp sci class news group asking for a program partner.

01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:20.980
I need a partner so I can finish my next program by Wednesday.

01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:24.980
And fuck sexual frustration, especially at 18 and away at college and a virgin.

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:25.980
Aw.

01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:26.980
You poor baby.

01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:29.980
Sorry, Loki. That's information you don't want to give out on the air.

01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:32.980
Dude, that's like being hungry in a fast food joint.

01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:34.980
Yeah, exactly.

01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:38.980
If you can't order from the menu, there's something wrong there.

01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:44.980
Hey, you know what, black guy, if you want to get laid, but see the thing is he has a girlfriend.

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:47.980
He saves himself. They're in love and all this stuff, you know.

01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:53.980
So, we can't exactly just go take him to a bar, get him drunk, and get the little chick drunk and say, okay, here's the bed.

01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:58.980
I've heard this story before, too. Let's see, I think the beginning of Road Trip, it had something very similar.

01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:04.980
They're in love, you know, they're away at college, and I believe, what was it?

01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:06.980
Oh, I forget his name, but anyway, he's just like,

01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:08.980
Your penis can never forgive you.

01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:10.980
Hahahahaha!

01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:12.980
Give me five days of opportunity!

01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:14.980
I'm gonna pack up my balls and leave!

01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:20.980
Okay, there's plenty of pussy wanting to be a pussy there, I call it. Take it there.

01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:26.980
If you want to get laid, we will get you laid, it just won't be your girlfriend, sorry.

01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:32.980
I'm sure she's a nice lady, but if she ain't gonna open the legs, you ain't gonna get in, so...

01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:37.140
in defense

01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:40.900
yes

01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:43.580
overruled

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:46.820
objection

01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:49.660
i think

01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:52.020
you think that is admirable

01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:52.900
no

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:55.380
this is the thing though

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:58.740
not going to because you're not you're not me

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:01.100
and here's what i think

01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:05.900
I'm sure she's a wonderful girl. All the girls I dated in high school were saving themselves

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:10.960
for marriage, too. And I'd like to point out, I turned out gay. So be careful. Don't make

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:12.500
Ryan gay. He won't like it.

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:18.620
You know, this might have been popular back in the 90s. 1890s? Not today. This is a cloak.

01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:21.900
Get with the times here. People don't do that shit no more. And when they do, they're lying.

01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:23.100
Look, look at, like this.

01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:29.800
For the record, for the record. Okay. I said that I was going to save myself for the one

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:34.800
person who I was going to spend the rest of my life with, and I did, because I'm going

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:41.800
to marry Anne, and so there are people with morals in this world, thank you, even though

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:42.800
I'm currently...

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.800
Screw morals, orders of G.H.B. online, that'll get you laid real quick.

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:47.800
Although I'm currently living in this area.

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:54.800
This is what it boils down to. You don't have to put out for the horny 18-year-old. Listen

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:59.480
lady when you're 35 and you're at your sexual peak and no guy's gonna have sex

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:05.360
with you don't come whining to us

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:13.200
you may think that but no that ain't gonna happen then by then by then it's

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:16.520
like this okay you're trying you're trying to know oh fuck it you know I

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:22.360
give up I'm gonna go build a car and then she's like I'm trying to fucking

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:25.200
go my car with the fuck trying to drink it

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:28.360
they have said the worry twenty years ago with the help

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.560
now you like it now

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:32.280
with world down there

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:37.280
shoes on the other hand now is it

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:41.280
and

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:45.080
i don't even know the meaning of the word

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:48.080
yes okay i'm going to take care of that

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:52.080
word to plural before you, thanks to dicksmary.com.

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:55.480
Okay, you know what, Black Lab's F.U. has just stopped the F.U.'s of the week segment

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:58.320
while we look this stuff up. We'll resume it in a minute.

01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:08.320
D.L.O.R.A.B.L. Let's see. Get top ten most popular ones.

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:20.320
condemnation or reproach. Lamentable, woeful, wretched, bad. As in, damn you suck! Deplorable!

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:26.320
That was the fourth definition there, I think. Yeah, the dictionary according to Jamie.

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:31.320
Alright, are we ready to resume the FUs of the week? Can you guys all stop talking about sex now?

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:34.320
Yeah.

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:35.320
You got that?

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:36.320
Yeah.

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:41.320
Dick is in, go choke on life.

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:42.320
Ahh!

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:43.320
Ahh!

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:45.320
Brad's giving me head, live on air.

01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:46.320
Alright.

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:47.320
That's a good radio.

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:48.320
I thought our radio could go up.

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.320
I hate radio.

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:50.320
That's what we need to do.

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:54.280
Now we've done drunk, then we need to have the sex show, where we have people get laid

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:55.280
live on air.

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:56.280
I won't be here for that.

01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.280
I'll be at home.

01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:00.320
And then we'll have the violence show, where we kill something.

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:04.320
Where I take a sledgehammer and go chasing after a bunny.

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:09.320
No, bunnies, don't kill bunnies. Bunnies are cute.

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:12.320
You guys are the name of oolong.

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:16.320
You guys are me.

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:18.320
You guys are so cute.

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:19.320
It's a target.

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.320
No!

01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:23.320
You guys are awful.

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:25.320
Rob, I like bunnies too.

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:26.320
For dinner.

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:28.320
You guys are awful.

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.320
Rob's going to get a bunny.

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:31.320
I want to get a bunny.

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:34.320
It's going to poop little round things all over your house.

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.320
I only eat the cute animals.

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.320
You can potty train your bunny.

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.320
I'm an adder!

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.320
Can we get back to the shower refuse please?

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.320
Okay, you don't have to get under here. What are you?

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.320
I'm a cow. Get on the train!

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:48.320
Dennis Leary.

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.320
Moving on.

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:52.320
Just bring out a whole cow.

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:56.320
I'll call Brock what I want and ride the rest home.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:58.320
Okay, this is me.

01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:05.320
3F-2T-2T-2T-2T-2T-2T-2T-2T

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:36.320
nephew to himself with big black cocks, nephew to everyone who doesn't like his so-called freestyle double routine to the whistle song, complete with pelvic thrusts on freezes.

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:41.320
Exactly, whatever, why don't you go cry me a river and blow me a rap?

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:44.320
Get over it, guys.

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.320
And all the other qué ché.

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:50.320
Maple...

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:52.320
says...

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.320
Love is purple.

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:54.320
Excuse me.

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:55.320
Love is orange.

01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:56.320
Maple says...

01:22:56.320 --> 01:23:01.520

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:07.720
i am more in charge

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:14.720
that's what you get both

01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:22.720
So I would actually run around wearing orange if you ever pitched because that kicks the ball.

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:27.720
So I'd be like, excuse me, this is the...anyway, back to back to back.

01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:29.720
Can I read Maples F.U. now?

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:30.720
No, I will.

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:33.720
You want to? Go ahead. No, now you're good at it.

are your best friends who are supposed to support you and your decisions no matter what

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:22.080
but they end up disagreeing with you and making you feel shitty even though you're making

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:27.080
a decision you believe in i have to move it off okay if a person is showing your friends

01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:31.080
that they feel like something you're doing is going to end up hurting you in the long

01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:36.080
run they are a better person to not be supporting you in the long run

01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:57.080
And if your friend sees something or has experience like that, that you know is going to say that

01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:01.080
this experience that you're going through right now is going to come back and bite you

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:11.080
invite you in the ass, you better listen to your friends advice, especially if that person has the experience with no one. Don't discount your friend, just because they're showing a little bit of dis-discovery, ok?

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:16.080
Unless they're drunk, then don't listen to them.

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:17.080
Yeah, they're drunk too.

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:20.080
Wow. This, this uh... orange lounge suddenly got deep.

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:27.080
You know, it's an experience of mine. I just turned to somebody's advice one time, and I was really hurt for it.

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:35.080
So, I always keep it up in mind whenever you're playing this video, try to stand up and say what you're doing.

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:47.080
And don't listen to them when they say that some girl likes you, because even though they may be their best friend, and they may know them for years, they're wrong and lying to you.

01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:50.080
They were having a little bit of trouble hearing you, Jamie.

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:52.080
They're having a little trouble hearing all of us, actually.

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:54.080
I'm sorry, it's because of that buzz bug we're having.

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:58.080
Let me turn off the music so you can hear Jamie good and loud.

01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.080
Alright.

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:01.080
This is what I had to say.

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:06.080
For whatever advice your friend is giving you, if they're going from experience,

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:12.080
if they've had experience that maybe something that you're going through right now isn't necessarily something that might be good for you,

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:23.080
If they see potential harm in what you're doing, you'd best appreciate that kind of advice because it takes a lot of bravery to tell your friends, I don't think what you're doing is the right thing.

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:29.080
It takes a shallow person to just agree with everything just because they want to keep you as a friend.

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:34.080
It takes a really strong person to say, I disagree with you and this is why.

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:39.080
So, that's all it is. You just have to keep an open mind toward what your friends tell you.

01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:44.080
Alright. Although Angel says she was drunk, so...

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:47.080
Okay, if this one was drunk, then just screw it.

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:51.080
But still, we appreciated deep thoughts with Jamie.

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:54.080
Now back to the pornography chat. Alright.

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:57.080
Chubz says,

01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:03.080
I can't think of any FUs, so FU to Jack in the Box again for taking away the 99% Westerner.

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:06.080
How was his FU last week?

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:07.080
Alright.

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:15.080
Stressa wants to get laid live on air, so he's volunteering to come down for that show.

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:19.080
Stressa, we'll take you to the Bunny Ranch.

01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:20.080
Alright.

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:22.080
Chat Cookie says, Fuck you, Black Lab.

01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:24.080
You're just jealous of my chocolate chips.

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:29.080
Also, I want to send out a nephew to everyone that's envious of my sweet perfections.

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:32.080
That was a robot.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:38.620
And now, 23rd Vegas has a special little F.U. this week.

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:41.980
And I'm even giving him his own song because he begged and pleaded enough and I just wanted

01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:43.960
him to stop begging because it was getting sad.

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:46.840
So he's saying,

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:50.180
My life is so full of bliss, I have no F.U. for the week.

01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:51.980
I do, however, have something different.

01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:54.860
I'd like to send a love you to DGR Angel.

01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:57.740
Will you be my Bamani girl?

01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:59.020
Not just that, something deeper.

01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:03.600
I love you, and I'm willing to make sure we are together and forever.

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:04.600
How about you?

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:06.660
Will you stay with me forever?

01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:10.240
That was cute.

01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:15.820
Too many serious moments here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:20.020
And people getting laid, and it's not me, and that makes me cry.

01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:26.020
Oh, but I am getting a massage, so maybe I like wall-er-ing in my pity here.

01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:29.520
Why are you crying?

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:30.520
You want to go give...

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:31.520
Hey, stop it.

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:32.520
Go give her a massage.

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:33.520
Yes she...

01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:34.520
Yes she does.

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:35.520
What?

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:36.520
What?

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:39.520
Listen, touch me and I'll break your finger.

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:40.600
Well, wait a minute.

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:41.600
You're complaining about...

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:42.600
I am not a cryman.

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:43.600
Hold on.

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.200
You're complaining about not getting...

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:48.920
You're complaining about not getting any, uh, massages and then Brad's all, okay, I'll

01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:49.920
give you a massage.

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:50.920
You're like, touch me and I'll break your finger.

01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:51.920
My shoulder's hurting.

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:52.920
It makes me angsty.

01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:53.920
Oh.

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:55.920
Oh.

01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:02.920
Brad! Brad! I need oral service!

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.920
Dad, say something.

01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:08.920
So, you know what, we never did get the answer here.

01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:11.920
It's like, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:12.920
AHHHH!

01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:13.920
FFFF!

01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:18.920
Yeah.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:21.920
I bet I went to private message. Teehee.

01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:23.920
Well, that's not fair!

01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:26.920
Oh no, we got big hugs. Big tugs.

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:31.920
And oh my god, OMG! We got an OMG! OMG!

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:33.920
OMG! OMG!

01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:35.920
Yeah, you know me!

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:40.920
Okay, moving on. Let's see, I'm checking some...

01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:42.920
You down with entropy?

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:48.920
Alright, let's check the mailboxes. I forgot to check the mail.

01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:20.920
Omg, omg, omg, omg, omg, omg!

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:54.920
I know I've got one. I know I'm trying to find it. Here it is. Okay, some booty dance menu. Here you go. We'll be back.

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:19.920
You can't touch this

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:20.920
You can't touch this

01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:25.920
My, my, my, my music you make me so hard Make me say, oh my boy, thank you

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:27.920
For blessing me with a mind too loud and too high

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:29.920
It feels good when you know we are down

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:31.920
I took a little homeboy from the off town and I'm known

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.920
It's such a good feeling, you can't touch

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:36.920
I told you homeboy, you can't touch this

01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:38.920
Yeah, that's how we livin' and you know

01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:40.920

I'm making them sweat, that's what I'm giving them now

01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:19.120
Say no, you talk about the hell when you're talking about a show that's tight

01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:22.120
And tight, singles I've spent so fast in my wife gonna take

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:25.120
Two words, what you gonna take in the 90s to rise the charts

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:28.120
Legit, if you fall, you might as well quit

01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:30.120
That word, cause you know

01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:31.120

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:34.120
You can't touch this

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.120
Break it down!

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:36.120
Stop!

01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:37.120
Hammer time!

01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:38.120
Every time you see me, my hammer's just so high

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:39.120
I'm dope on the floor and I'm battling for the fight

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.120
Now why would I ever stop doing this?

01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:41.120
With all the same expectations and just no hits

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.120
I told them about the world, from London to America

01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:43.120
It's happening all the time

01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:44.120
It's happening all the time

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:45.120
It's happening all the time

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:57.120
Throw it like you mean it, blow

01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:11.120
Let me hear you say

01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:25.120
Louder, let me hear you say Louder, is that what you call loud?

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:31.120
Come on, let me hear you say Let me hear you say

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:40.120
Louder, I said louder You need to bring the beat back

01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:12.120
You

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:58.120
The following bit of randomness has been brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:00.120
Dateline, the Muppet Show.

01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:04.120
It has been reported just moments ago that a large heavy object was dropped from the ceiling.

01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:06.120
Further developments will...

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:07.120
Hey, will you go up there and ask?

01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:10.120
About the biggest berry I've ever seen, Diggleberry!

01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:49.420
My brother is a Marine, and he has to go to Kuwait next month, so fuck all of them.

01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:53.640
I agree, I think the, I think, I can't understand when like there's all these countries that

01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:58.760
are against the war, but you know what, he ain't popular with me, of course I wouldn't

01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:05.120
have ever voted for the guy in first place, but yeah, I agree, I think the whole war is

01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:08.120
stupid, and I think Bush is just asking for trouble, and he's not going to get re-elected.

01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:14.120
I voted Donald Duck. Donald Duck in two thousand and, what, four? Two thousand four.

01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:19.120
I think when his re-election comes up, we should all vote for Strong Bad.

01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:21.120
Okay, we'll vote for Strong Bad, that's fine.

01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:23.120
From Homestar Runner.

01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:29.120
Everybody, go to HomestarRunner.com after the show, and read the Strong Bad email.

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:30.120
Alright.

01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:34.120
We've said our piece because we don't want to turn this into a completely political show.

01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:38.120
I just want to send them a letter that says fuck you right in your ear because your ass ain't good enough.

01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:08.120
We could. Do you have anything actual?

01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:12.120
Yeah, give us a sim update. Let's get the show back on track.

01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:16.120
Yay! Yay!

01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:20.120
Earlier this week, well actually, a couple websites are going through a couple changes.

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:24.120
We had a big Bomani-style bitchfest going on.

01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:28.120
And they're redoing some stuff.

01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:32.120
Supposedly they didn't like the fact that people were leeching files off their site.

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:38.440
site. I'm sorry, you don't mean the Bimani style, you mean, hold on, keep going, never

01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:43.400
mind, I've got to get something queued up here. Okay, yeah, other than that, DDRManiaX,

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:49.280
they had a whole site relaunch with a brand new design to it, so it's kind of pretty,

01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:53.960
and so that's pretty cool to have that going on. See, other than that, Bimani style is

01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:58.720
releasing a brand new, well actually they're the same DDRXtreme files, but now they have

01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:04.860
backgrounds in them. Woohoo! So those will be coming up pretty soon. They have like three

01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:11.540
up right now. And let's see, other than that, here let me cut you off for just a second

01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:23.540
because I wanted to say, it's not Bahmani style, it's Bahmani style because god damn,

01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:28.460
they do everything for this community. They bend over backwards and they died on the cross

01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:29.460
for this community.

01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:30.460
Wha.

01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:34.820
It's like every, uh, those aren't my CDs, actually.

01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:37.900
Yeah, they're like, we post files and you're not, and now you're binging.

01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:38.900
I swear those aren't my CDs.

01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:39.900
I don't know if they are.

01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:40.900
The rest of our site.

01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:41.900
Wha.

01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:43.820
Anyways, um, so that's, that's that.

01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:49.060
I'm hoping that with the creation of Leech from Loki, uh, that, um, or actually finishing

01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:53.560
putting up the website that I meant to do last week but because my Linux screwed up

01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:58.780
my computer for three days didn't get to it site, um, hopefully that'll be like, okay,

01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:02.600
well, you're leeching from us, go leech from him, because he doesn't care, and that's the

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:03.600
whole thing.

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:06.040
Are you gonna put the announcer files up on your site, chat rooms wondering?

01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:11.400
Yes I am, and I've ripped the announcer files from DDA Extreme with, uh, yee-haw! So we've

01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:12.560
got that on there too.

01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:16.520
And I'm not slamming on any other websites, by the way, but just, you know, the whole

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:21.240
Jesus complex, it's the internet, everybody leeches from everybody, that's the whole concept.

01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:25.240
If you don't want people to be doing it, don't post it.

01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:28.240
I mean, it doesn't make sense, you guys. Stop.

01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:30.240
Be nice. Be nice to each other. That's all we want.

01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:32.240
Well, here's another thing.

01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:34.240
They're wondering why people are turned away from this site.

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:35.240
Well, let's see. Here's some of their mods.

01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:37.240
They've got Slip. Slip's a mod on that site.

01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:40.240
I don't want to get into personally bashing people on this show.

01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:42.240
Actually, he had some pretty funny comments.

01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:43.240
I like reading his stuff.

01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:46.240
I mean, even when he's ripping on stupid people, that's hilarious.

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:47.240
Hilarious.

01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:51.200
But yeah, other than that, let's see some stuff I forgot last week.

01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:57.800
There was this, it was a DDR, sort of a money-related DDR,

01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:01.760
like e-magazine type thing that went out.

01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:03.560
It had some pretty funny stuff.

01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:05.960
I wanted to print it out, but it was on my zip drive,

01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:07.520
so unfortunately I couldn't do that.

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:11.920
It was kind of all right, made by some Canadians, I think.

01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:15.200
See, aside from all that stuff.

01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:29.200
Oh, DWI Insanity, they just released Easy to Dancer songs, a whole pack of those that are DWIs now, so go check those out. Those are pretty cool. Links on DDR Maniacs if you want to check that out.

01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:36.200
And always just keep watching their forums. There's going to be files to release and whatnot.

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:43.200
CDDR East Coast Invasions is going to be doing another tourney mix, I'm sure, tourney mix 4.

01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:48.200
They're talking about doing one every three months, I think, so I'll probably put it in April.

01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:56.200
And they're also running a contest right now, where it's a bmoni music remixing contest.

01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.200
You just pick songs, remix them.

01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:03.200
They have to be anywhere from one and a half minutes to, I believe, four minutes in length.

01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:08.200
And you win a mixed CD with all of the winners on it.

01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:09.200
Ooh!

01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.200
Yeah, so.

01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:14.200
BlackLab wants to know, when is there going to be a DDR sim for Macs, god damn it?

01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:15.200
For what?

01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:16.200
Macs.

01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:17.200
Macintoshes.

01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:18.200
For Macs?

01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:21.200
Um, well there sort of is right now.

01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:28.200
There's um, uh, I don't know, I remember there was one that was for multiple platforms.

01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:35.200
I don't think it was PyDDR, but there was one that was from multiple platforms that I posted a long time ago.

01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:37.200
But yeah, I don't know.

01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:41.200
Alright, he's just Max, so that's why they don't make Sims for him.

01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:45.200
Dude, get out of his lap, man!

01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:48.200
Giving him a lap dance during the show.

01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:53.200
And no news on Feta Fury. It's supposed to be finished in March, I think.

01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:58.200
Yeah, Feta's Fury. Yeah!

01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:03.200
I know the game's so bad it makes you grow up and kill people.

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:08.200
But Fury.

01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:13.200
Black Lab wanted me to ask if you guys were interested in doing...

01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:17.540
There's actually some new programming coming to Orange Lounge in the very new future.

01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:21.420
We have the Johnny the Homicidal Maniac special, the drama that's going to be...when is that

01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:22.420
finished?

01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:23.420
Do we know when that's going to be finished?

01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:24.420
I feel sick.

01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:25.420
Yeah, I feel sick, thank you.

01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:26.420
I don't really know.

01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:27.420
I haven't heard from the show.

01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:30.000
I actually have to re-record my lines with the psychic lady.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Ah, okay.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.920
We're going to be having a new music show coming that's going to be debuting soon, as

01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:39.560
soon as I get the list from you guys, and I haven't even told Logie about it yet.

01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:43.560
I'm always on loop, both at work and life and everything.

01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:46.560
But you guys will be sending me these.

01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:47.560
We're going to have a long version program.

01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:51.560
We've had a lot of requests to play more long version of Bahmani Musics.

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:54.560
So we're going to have a Bahmani Music block at some point.

01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:59.560
We might do it at a certain time every day for like an hour, but just like some long versions,

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:03.560
because we've had some requests to play more long stuff on Orange Long's radio.

01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:06.560
So we're going to do long versions of your favorite Bahmani songs.

01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:07.560
I like it long.

01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:10.900
yes, because you guys like it long and hard. So we'll be doing that. That's a new show

01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:15.540
coming to Orange Lawn very soon. And Black Lab's suggesting that we, since we've turned

01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:20.260
into a soap opera here, we can do a show called As the Orange Turns. And it can be this whole

01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:26.260
side project, another show with voice acting and everything. And Black Lab wants to see

01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:32.560
if anyone would want to do it. That sounds like fun. Jamie's raised her hand. So we could

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:46.460
like all over act on air and stuff. Shut up you bastard! I'm not going to let you see

01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:53.340
your baby. Oh yeah, well I'm an alien twin from another planet. I came here to steal

01:45:53.340 --> 01:46:08.340
I don't have any multiple personalities, but my other ones do. All five of them. And they're

01:46:08.340 --> 01:46:09.340
twins.

01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:10.340
And mine.

01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:15.340
It was like this, y'all! It's so cool!

01:46:15.340 --> 01:46:18.340
Okay.

01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:20.340
We're not nerds here!

01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:22.340
Anyways.

01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:24.340
So is that all you had to say about SimNews?

01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:30.340
Uh, there's nothing going on because people are lazy and school and distracted by the Super Bowl and...

01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:34.340
I want some of your nuts, Brad. These are good, thank you.

01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:38.340
You know, I'm a non-nut person. I hate nuts. Nuts suck.

01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:41.340
I don't like nuts, man.

01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:43.340
Your cashews are in the living room, dear.

01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:52.340
Alright, we're gonna get to the cage match now, finally.

01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:57.340
So, last week in the big, fat, hairy, scary cage match.

01:46:57.340 --> 01:47:01.340
You know what, I don't even have a song picked for this weekend, so I've got to pick it like right now.

01:47:01.340 --> 01:47:03.340
No, I'm gonna do it.

01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:04.340
You already won.

01:47:04.340 --> 01:47:05.340
Alright.

01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:06.340
No, you can pick his own.

01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:07.340
Here we go.

01:47:07.340 --> 01:47:14.340
Remember, you can pick your friends and you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friend's cage match song.

01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:24.340
Last week, on the Orange Mountain Cage Match, we had a very narrow victory over that Eat Em Up song by FX Twin.

01:47:24.340 --> 01:47:30.340
The winner of last week's cage match was Ayumi Hamasaki with M, the Above and Beyond remix.

01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:36.340
Oh, by the way, the cage match, for those that don't know, we played three songs, most just picked each song.

01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:41.340
And you can vote. You can vote for last week's winner. You can vote for one of the two new songs.

01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:48.340
And the winning song goes into rotation during Orange Lounge Radio's Blumani Music and More program,

01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:51.340
which plays all the time on this station when we're not here.

01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:55.340
So this is last week's winner. We're only going to play a small clip of it.

01:47:55.340 --> 01:47:57.660
This is Ayumi Hamasaki with M, and you can vote for this.

01:47:57.660 --> 01:47:59.660
This is the first thing you can vote for in this week's stage match.

01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:45.500
Alright, that was last week's winner, AyumiHamasaki with M, so that's the first thing you can

01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:46.500
vote for.

01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:47.500
And...

01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:51.660
And, uh, you know what, I don't give a fuck if this is, uh, you know, a little, uh, private

01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:52.660
shit.

01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:53.660
Okay, go ahead.

01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:57.540
Listen, you fucking bitch twin, I didn't fucking diss slip, I was making a comment

01:49:57.540 --> 01:50:02.360
about how slip causes people that not want to be talking on the forums because anyone

01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:06.520
that says anything stupid, he will go off on them. I didn't say anything bad about that.

01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:11.460
That's cool, because, you know, people like doing that. Hell, I like joking with stupid

01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:16.140
people and making fun of them. That's my thing. So I didn't make fun of slip at all, you know

01:50:16.140 --> 01:50:20.400
what, and they're doing a good job on that site even though, you know, they don't like

01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:24.520
leeches and that kind of thing, but hey, that's their thing. I didn't ever say anything bad

01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:28.360
about slip at all so you know what you go fuck yourself and you're fucking bad

01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:32.380

01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:46.560
the off chance that there's one of you listening do yourselves a favor and ban

01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:51.240
twin from your channel that's it I realized I realized we don't get along

01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:54.240
We don't see eye-to-eye on everything, dudes that run that place.

01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:55.240
But you know what?

01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:58.240
Honestly, human-to-human, just do yourself a favor, ban them.

01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:00.240
First of all, you know what?

01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:05.240
And as for twin, I put twin in the same category that I put slip.

01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:07.240
People I don't pay attention to.

01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:09.240
Alright, fair enough. No more personal drama on this show.

01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:11.240
Didn't we say fuck drama earlier? Look at that.

01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:12.240
Well, I'm saying fuck it now.

01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:14.240
I know, I know. I know, it's stupid.

01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:16.240
Can we do a cage match now? Yes.

01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:17.240
Alright, let's do the cage match.

01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:19.240

01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:28.240

Imagine there's a place and the light you see is not only in your imagination.

01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:44.240

01:54:13.240 --> 01:54:14.240
Forever

01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:15.240
For ever

01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:16.240
Forever

01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:17.240

01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:26.240

01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:27.240

01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:28.240

01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:29.240

01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:30.240
Forever

01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:31.240
Forever

01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:42.860
Alright.

01:54:42.860 --> 01:55:06.180
Alright, neat. That was in the cage match. Vincent D'Amore with Eternity, the full vocal

01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:12.480
remix and now I have a I have a controversial pic for this week's cage

01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:16.100
match oh I'm sorry yes we have to go around the room and rate it up my bad

01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:20.580
ten for eternity any particular reason why

01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:25.580
the world. It appeals to the music feeling good in my head.

01:55:25.580 --> 01:55:28.580
Alright. Loki!

01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:33.580
I liked it, but it's like, it's just, I don't know, it's just a bit more.

01:55:33.580 --> 01:55:38.580
It's an 8, I don't know, because I like all the stuff, but it's not even like a scandal.

01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:40.580
Woah! It's something I never heard before.

01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:44.580
Uh, you didn't even hear the song, did you? That we just did.

01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:45.580
What song?

01:55:45.580 --> 01:55:47.580
Uh, Eternity by more.

01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:48.580
I've heard it.

01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:49.580
What do you think?

01:55:49.580 --> 01:55:53.580
I think it's very classic. I agree with both of you.

01:55:53.580 --> 01:55:57.580
I jumped out and was like, holy crap!

01:55:57.580 --> 01:56:01.580
But it's really good. I like it. It's very classic.

01:56:01.580 --> 01:56:05.580
For a hand, I'd rate it about a seven.

01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:09.580
Overall, I'd rate it a nine.

01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:13.580
Alright, Vincent D'Amore. I love Vincent D'Amore. I give it a nine.

01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:17.580
Eternity. It's not the best Vincent D'Amore song, but it's pretty damn cool and I wouldn't be

01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:29.340
I have a kind of controversial one. This is from a trance compilation, and unfortunately

01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:33.520
I don't have the name of the artist that did this. I have it somewhere, I just don't have

01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:37.860
it on me right now. I can tell you this comes from the Velfire Cyber Trance compilation.

01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:43.960
This is track 4, and this is a remix of Thunderstruck, which was by ACDC originally, which is a group

01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:48.840
I don't particularly care for usually, but I know Jamie really likes them, and she does not like this mix at all.

01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:50.840
I already know what I'm giving it.

01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:56.720
it one alright but judge for yourself this is the third entry in the cage mess

01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:03.720
this week. It's a remix of Thunderstruck. Enjoy.

01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:27.720
Thunder

01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:32.720
I was caught in the middle of a railroad track

01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:33.720
Thunder

01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:39.720
I was small and I knew there was no turning back

01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:40.720
Thunder

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:45.720
My, my life and I thought what could I do

01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:46.720
Thunder

01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:52.720
And I knew there was no help, no help from you

01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:59.720
Thunder

01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:05.720
Thunder

01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:12.720
Thunder

01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:19.720
Thunder

01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:21.720
Thunder

01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:28.720
Thunder

01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:35.720
Thunder

01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:45.720
Thunder

01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:50.720
Thunder

01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:25.720
Yeah

01:59:25.720 --> 01:59:30.720
Yeah

01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:35.720
Yeah

01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:37.720
Yeah!

01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:40.720
Thunder

02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:30.240
All right, that was from the Velfire Cybertron CD, Thunder, a little recent.

02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:33.240
We're about to throw up, I guess.

02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:36.240
All right, Jamie, dare I ask, what did you think of Thunder?

02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:37.240
Negative 12.

02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:53.240
Sorry, I love this song. And I like how they split the guitar mix with the keyboard mix, but I hate that it exists. That's the song. You should never transmit AT-AT.

02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:09.240
It doesn't make any sense.

02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:11.240
No. Off of one.

02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:13.240
Even better, uh...

02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:15.240
Um...

02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:17.240
What'd you think of that, Brad?

02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:19.240
I caught, like, the last five seconds.

02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:21.240
And I...

02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:23.240
Give it a ten.

02:01:23.240 --> 02:01:25.240
I didn't hear it, but now that I...

02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:27.240
I think I understand what it was. It was thunderstorms?

02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:29.240
Yeah, but it was cool for internet.

02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:31.240
Oh yeah, that was cool.

02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:33.240
Woo!

02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:35.240
Dude, that DJ should be...

02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:40.800
The game should be blacklisted. It's never really allowed to be recorded.

02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:46.400
All right, fine. Then I'm giving it a ten simply to counterweight the rest of your votes.

02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:51.520
I'm sorry, but you're dealing with two ones and a minus twelve? Your ten loses!

02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:53.720
I give it a ten! Ten, ten, ten!

02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:55.640
It gives an overall of negative one.

02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:57.800
Oh, he gave it a zero. He gave it a one.

02:01:57.800 --> 02:01:59.880
I gave it a minus twelve.

02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:01.200
All right.

02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:02.400
I gave it a zero.

02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:05.000
Yay, Loki!

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.240
So send in your votes right now over a private message in the channel and we'll tally up

02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:11.420
those votes and have it for you later.

02:02:11.420 --> 02:02:22.800
You can vote for either Ayumi Hamasaki, you can vote for Vincent D'Amore with Eternity,

02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:37.480
Oh, gee, I guess there are no exciting parts, sorry.

02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:41.280
And then, uh, the trance remix of Thunderstruck that nobody likes here at Orange Lounges and

02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:42.280
Me.

02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:51.420
All right, so you can vote for any one of those right now.

02:02:51.420 --> 02:02:52.420
Right fucking now!

02:02:52.420 --> 02:02:53.420
It should be called Blunder.

02:02:53.420 --> 02:02:54.420
Blunderstruck.

02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:59.900
And the winner goes into rotation.

02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:00.900
On the Bill Monte Music War.

02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:01.900
I'm gonna be on the microphone, you're gonna give us a disease.

02:03:01.900 --> 02:03:05.780
Alright, I'm gonna give you all an STD live on air.

02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:09.300
Hi, I'm getting weird looks.

02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:13.080
AIDS for everyone!

02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:15.420
That's going in the next intro.

02:03:15.420 --> 02:03:18.540
That was a winner.

02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:23.740
I'm going to give all the little underprivileged children in the world AIDS, myself.

02:03:23.740 --> 02:03:25.740
You're awful!

02:03:25.740 --> 02:03:27.740
You're an awful person!

02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:32.740
Brad will give them all AIDS, and I'll give them a kick in the ass.

02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:35.220
Yes, because I'm Jared Fogle from Subway.

02:03:35.220 --> 02:03:39.420
You'll give them AIDS and I'll give them a yeast infection.

02:03:39.420 --> 02:03:43.420
Wait a minute!

02:03:43.420 --> 02:03:47.220
Do you keep it in a jar or something so you can just open it up, a can of yeast infection

02:03:47.220 --> 02:03:57.420
What disease would you like to transmit?

02:03:57.420 --> 02:04:02.260
I can transmit the stupid, I guess.

02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:06.260
I have the rockin pneumonia and the boogie woogie food.

02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:09.340
What disease do you want to transmit, Rob?

02:04:09.340 --> 02:04:11.180
What disease do I want to transmit?

02:04:11.180 --> 02:04:13.300
2dx.

02:04:13.300 --> 02:04:16.340
I want to transmit mental retardation.

02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:27.900
I want to transmit the gay gene.

02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:29.860
Remember you already infected my Pepsi bong.

02:04:29.860 --> 02:04:30.860
Anal warts.

02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:31.860
No.

02:04:31.860 --> 02:04:34.740
What was that tournament that we were at Spigle for that day?

02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:35.740
Spigle 2.

02:04:35.740 --> 02:04:37.740
No, we were just there for randomness.

02:04:37.740 --> 02:04:38.740
Were we?

02:04:38.740 --> 02:04:40.020
Yeah, it was a random trip to Spigle.

02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:46.220
I got, this one they had the big bone, Pepsi bone drinks, but I called it the Pepsi bong.

02:04:46.220 --> 02:04:52.220
I asked Rob if he was thirsty, so he took a drink, and then I gave it back, and I took a drink, and he was like,

02:04:52.220 --> 02:04:57.220
I was like, Noah's like, sorry, I'm getting mixed up.

02:04:57.220 --> 02:05:02.220
Here, I don't have any diseases, and then he drank it, and then gave it to me, and I had a drink, and he goes, I have gay.

02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:07.220
I was like, oh no, I don't want women!

02:05:07.220 --> 02:05:10.220
And then I hugged our mane.

02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:11.220
Ow!

02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:16.220
We need some hot lesbian action on orientation. We need to call up Amanda and Jana and get them back on there.

02:05:16.220 --> 02:05:21.220
You know what's sad, though, is that Jana moved to the Bay Area to be with Amanda.

02:05:21.220 --> 02:05:26.220
Sorry, I don't want to see my ex-girlfriend having lesbians.

02:05:26.220 --> 02:05:31.220
Well, what if your current girlfriend had lesbian sex? Would that be okay?

02:05:31.220 --> 02:05:36.220
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:37.220
involved.

02:05:37.220 --> 02:05:44.460
Then it wouldn't be officially lesbian, but hey, I'm not complaining.

02:05:44.460 --> 02:05:48.580
Any straight guy that wants to see lesbian sex has this thought in the back of his head

02:05:48.580 --> 02:05:53.020
that it's not really lesbian sex because they'll be all, oh gosh, we're having lesbian sex

02:05:53.020 --> 02:05:58.100
and it's so great, but we really need a dick right now, join in.

02:05:58.100 --> 02:06:03.980
What they don't know is that they don't want the dick, I mean, they're lesbians, they hate

02:06:03.980 --> 02:06:14.380
What I don't get is why guys are so hot about seeing two chicks getting it on.

02:06:14.380 --> 02:06:17.380
What did you say earlier in the show about wanting to have that room at Golf Land where

02:06:17.380 --> 02:06:20.140
the hot guys get it on with each other?

02:06:20.140 --> 02:06:27.140
But yet, a certain significant other of mine has a problem with me wanting to see two guys

02:06:27.140 --> 02:06:28.140
get it on.

02:06:28.140 --> 02:06:29.140
Why?

02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:31.980
Because he's jealous of my Gucci collection.

02:06:31.980 --> 02:06:32.980
Same thing.

02:06:32.980 --> 02:06:35.980
Just gender. Just cocks.

02:06:35.980 --> 02:06:39.980
Well, if you just can't... Just cock?

02:06:39.980 --> 02:06:42.980
I don't... We're all adults here.

02:06:42.980 --> 02:06:45.980
I don't understand what the problem would be. I mean, it's like...

02:06:45.980 --> 02:06:48.980
I mean, hell, if I saw two lesbians, I wouldn't expect to be jumping in.

02:06:48.980 --> 02:06:52.980
I mean, hello, lesbian. Meaning they don't have sex with men.

02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:57.980
You're just watching. It's like a porno without the TV and without the videotape.

02:06:57.980 --> 02:07:01.980
Oh, and welcome to the real life, you know, thing here. Most lesbians are pretty ugly.

02:07:01.980 --> 02:07:14.980
For guys, I think it's okay because I think it's an easier time for guys to get it on, so women should actually have the advantage in seeing the gal we think.

02:07:14.980 --> 02:07:21.980
But, you know, it's harder for girls to be stimulating with tools.

02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:23.980
I'm confused, maybe.

02:07:23.980 --> 02:07:24.980
It's more effort.

02:07:24.980 --> 02:07:25.980
For girls, too?

02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:27.980
I think so.

02:07:27.980 --> 02:07:29.980
You have to have skill.

02:07:29.980 --> 02:07:35.980
See, girls, they have access to the equipment 24-7, so they know exactly what to do.

02:07:39.980 --> 02:07:43.980
I'm talking about how I jack my hot spicy boner every day, guys!

02:07:43.980 --> 02:07:47.980
Yeah, see, guys can get themselves off at any given time, okay?

02:07:47.980 --> 02:07:49.980
And girls can, too! It just takes a little longer.

02:07:49.980 --> 02:07:50.980
Not necessarily!

02:07:50.980 --> 02:07:51.980
I'm sorry, Jim.

02:07:51.980 --> 02:07:53.980
I'm not elaborating on that, though.

02:07:55.980 --> 02:07:56.980
Chat Room, what do you think?

02:07:56.980 --> 02:07:57.980
Yes, talk to us.

02:07:57.980 --> 02:07:58.980
Who has an easier time getting off?

02:07:58.980 --> 02:08:02.980
How many girls are in the chat room now that can tell us how quickly to get off?

02:08:02.980 --> 02:08:05.980
I think it would take absolutely nothing for a guy to get off.

02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:06.980
Yeah, it could take me about 10 seconds.

02:08:06.980 --> 02:08:08.980
Guys' top boners are the most stupid things.

02:08:08.980 --> 02:08:11.980
Dude, when I first saw Metroid Prime...

02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:14.980
Oh...

02:08:14.980 --> 02:08:17.980
You mean you don't get a kalidon?

02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:20.980
Remember the porno last night? They were talking about kalidons.

02:08:20.980 --> 02:08:23.980
It doesn't work that way.

02:08:23.980 --> 02:08:25.980
It does not work that way.

02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:27.980
Because we're more sophisticated beings.

02:08:27.980 --> 02:08:30.980
Oh, oh, wait a minute. Hold on.

02:08:30.980 --> 02:08:34.980
It takes more to simulate a woman.

02:08:34.980 --> 02:08:37.980
It takes diesel-powered equipment.

02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:41.980
Michael, I have to seriously give you that.

02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:44.980
I gotta give you a copy of that sex-court TV, the movie.

02:08:44.980 --> 02:08:46.980
That's hilarious. She has, she has, okay.

02:08:46.980 --> 02:08:51.980
You know how they have those, um, uh, those, like, hedge clippers?

02:08:51.980 --> 02:08:53.980
You know, with the blade that goes up and down?

02:08:53.980 --> 02:08:57.980
Okay well imagine that but you strap a dildo to it and she's just like REEEE!

02:08:57.980 --> 02:08:58.980
REEEEEEEE!

02:08:58.980 --> 02:09:01.980
Going at it with that.

02:09:01.980 --> 02:09:02.980
Alright.

02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:05.980
I think we're going to take a quick break and try to get the show out of the toilet.

02:09:05.980 --> 02:09:06.980
Umm...

02:09:06.980 --> 02:09:07.980
When we come back...

02:09:07.980 --> 02:09:08.980
I found a funny site.

02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:09.980
Oh dear.

02:09:09.980 --> 02:09:13.980
I was looking for JoJin, she enacted out a site, I think it's gone now, called assmachine.

02:09:14.980 --> 02:09:15.980
Jesus!

02:09:17.980 --> 02:09:22.980
Where it had these like, these, some really hot guys in the site though.

02:09:22.980 --> 02:09:29.060
But it was these different machines they made with dildos on them and guys attached to them.

02:09:29.060 --> 02:09:30.660
It was funny.

02:09:30.660 --> 02:09:34.340
I was looking for Dildinci and I found this.

02:09:34.340 --> 02:09:37.460
This show is more in the potty than any other show we've done in the past.

02:09:37.460 --> 02:09:38.460
Awful.

02:09:38.460 --> 02:09:40.980
What about the cage match?

02:09:40.980 --> 02:09:41.980
We're going to tally up those votes during the break.

02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:44.640
We're going to get a break and try to be unfilty.

02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:45.640
We're going to do the break.

02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:46.640
We're going to try to unfilty ourselves.

02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:50.580
When we come back, we're going to do a segment we did a couple weeks ago that was kind of

02:09:50.580 --> 02:09:51.580
fun.

02:09:51.580 --> 02:09:52.580
The ass machine!

02:09:52.580 --> 02:09:55.180
No, we'll do, uh, how about Ask Orange Lounge?

02:09:55.180 --> 02:09:56.180
We can do that segment again.

02:09:56.180 --> 02:09:56.680
Ask!

02:09:56.680 --> 02:09:58.680
We're gonna do Ask Orange Lounge, no.

02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:00.680
Yes, you can play a song during the break.

02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:02.680
Yes, Loki's gonna pick the song during the break here.

02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:03.980
I think he just went Squeen, didn't you?

02:10:03.980 --> 02:10:05.980
And when we come back, we're gonna do Ask Orange Lounge.

02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:06.480
Whoo!

02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:07.980
Because, uh, it's fun.

02:10:07.980 --> 02:10:09.980
Remember, Ask Machine.

02:10:11.580 --> 02:10:12.380
I think the song went well.

02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:12.880
Alright.

02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:13.980
Well, okay.

02:10:13.980 --> 02:10:15.980
Loki's gonna give us a song during the break as well, but...

02:10:15.980 --> 02:10:19.780
First, uh, we'll play something from Bomani, because we...

02:10:19.780 --> 02:10:21.180
And, um, my song...

02:10:21.180 --> 02:10:21.980
What is that?

02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:32.980
My song is going to be coming from a punk band that I know called The Secretions, and this is from their debut CD called Till Death, and the song we'll be playing is called Boner.

02:10:32.980 --> 02:10:33.980
Okay, cool.

02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:35.980
They're going to love it. After some Tack.

02:10:35.980 --> 02:10:36.980
I like Boners.

02:10:36.980 --> 02:10:38.980
We're going to hear a Tack song and then we'll get to that.

02:10:38.980 --> 02:10:40.980
Alright, here we go!

02:11:38.980 --> 02:11:40.980
Oh

02:12:38.980 --> 02:13:06.980
You're here for me, but as everyone can see, everything about you changes my anatomy.

02:13:06.980 --> 02:13:10.980
The way you smack your gum while you're beating on your drum

02:13:10.980 --> 02:13:13.980
It makes me wanna jerk off your mum, is just feeling numb

02:13:13.980 --> 02:13:16.980
The best time is against you when you hold me

02:13:16.980 --> 02:13:19.980
So you can witness firsthand what you do to me

02:13:19.980 --> 02:13:23.980
That's not a pickle in my pocket, that's my purple passion rocket

02:13:23.980 --> 02:13:26.980
It's getting set to blast off just for you

02:13:26.980 --> 02:13:28.980
For you

02:13:28.980 --> 02:13:31.980
Baby, you make me pop a boater

02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:35.980
You make me live with my erectile shoe drive

02:13:35.980 --> 02:13:40.980
Baby, you make me pop a boner I think about you every day

02:13:40.980 --> 02:13:42.980
It's you I wanna lay

02:13:48.980 --> 02:13:51.980
You twinkle in your eye I mix the lump between my thighs

02:13:51.980 --> 02:13:54.980
I'm the bread, you're the oven You make my biscuit rise

02:13:54.980 --> 02:13:58.980
I'm gonna kiss you where it stinks Touch you where it stinks

02:13:58.980 --> 02:14:01.980
Do the things that money says you shouldn't honor think

02:14:01.980 --> 02:14:05.980
Gonna brush my lips against you when you hold me

02:14:05.980 --> 02:14:08.980
So you can really just pretend what you do to me

02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:10.980
That's not a pickle in my pocket

02:14:10.980 --> 02:14:12.980
That's my purple passion rocket

02:14:12.980 --> 02:14:15.980
Said you said you'd laugh up just for you

02:14:15.980 --> 02:14:17.980
For you

02:14:17.980 --> 02:14:20.980
Baby, you make me pop a boner

02:14:20.980 --> 02:14:24.980
You make me feel alive when my erect eye shoots lies

02:14:24.980 --> 02:14:27.980
Baby, you make me pop a boner

02:14:27.980 --> 02:14:29.980
I think of Christ here every day

02:14:29.980 --> 02:14:31.980
It's you I wanna lay

02:14:36.980 --> 02:14:37.980
Hello?

02:14:37.980 --> 02:14:39.980
I know what you're thinkin' here to get down

02:14:39.980 --> 02:14:42.980
You're just a dirty old man trying to get down my pants

02:14:42.980 --> 02:14:44.980
Well, that's not entirely true

02:14:44.980 --> 02:14:46.980
It seems I happen to think you're beautiful

02:14:46.980 --> 02:14:47.980
I happen to think you're intelligent

02:14:47.980 --> 02:14:49.980
I happen to think you have a wonderful sense of humor

02:14:49.980 --> 02:14:52.980
In fact, I might let you play with my dogs

02:14:52.980 --> 02:14:54.980
Cause I might be falling in love with you

02:14:54.980 --> 02:14:56.980
Look at the time, every time I see you

02:14:56.980 --> 02:14:57.980
I wanna rip your clothes off

02:14:57.980 --> 02:15:01.740
And if you feel orgasm, then so Godyourage can give you

02:15:01.740 --> 02:15:05.660
I know I can do it, and most of all, you know I can do it

02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:09.900
Baby, you make me pop a boner

02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:11.680
To make me feel alive

02:15:11.680 --> 02:15:13.780
When my erectile tissue glides

02:15:13.780 --> 02:15:16.460
Baby, you make me pop a boner

02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:18.560
I think about you every day

02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:20.080
You are one way

02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:23.140
Baby, you make me pop a boner

02:15:23.140 --> 02:15:25.060
To make me feel alive

02:15:25.060 --> 02:15:27.500
When my erectile tissue glides

02:15:27.500 --> 02:15:32.500
Hey, hey, you make me pop a boner I think I'll punch you every day

02:15:32.500 --> 02:15:34.500
It's you I wanna lay

02:15:39.500 --> 02:15:43.500
This is my guitar fix pick for the week, this is Pain with Fight

02:15:43.500 --> 02:16:04.780
Bored, drinking my beer on the floor Surrounded by people I'm mostly at war

02:16:04.780 --> 02:16:10.620
Wanting more And so the night goes, a lot of beer blows

02:16:10.620 --> 02:16:12.320
What can a guy do to make it right?

02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:15.820
And then abruptly my pair of eyes see a pair of guys get into a fight

02:16:18.020 --> 02:16:19.420
What do y'all think is pretty?

02:16:19.420 --> 02:16:21.620
I can make the whole life better

02:16:21.620 --> 02:16:22.920
Everybody loves to fight

02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:23.420
Fight!

02:16:23.420 --> 02:16:24.620
Everybody loves to fight

02:16:24.620 --> 02:16:25.120
Fight!

02:16:31.420 --> 02:16:34.120
I'll wash you like a bottle

02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:39.220
This wine

02:16:39.220 --> 02:16:46.220
Hit him in the eye, knocked him on the ground

02:16:46.220 --> 02:16:49.220
Now, he starts to cry

02:16:49.220 --> 02:16:51.220
I don't mean to be, obviously mean

02:16:51.220 --> 02:16:53.220
Trying to love each other, that's the way it should be

02:16:53.220 --> 02:16:55.220
But don't you think that maybe every once in a while

02:16:55.220 --> 02:16:56.220
A good fit might make everyone smile?

02:16:56.220 --> 02:16:58.220
But now if I can strike the ice

02:16:58.220 --> 02:17:00.220
And make the whole life better

02:17:00.220 --> 02:17:02.220
Everybody loves to fight

02:17:02.220 --> 02:17:03.660
Everybody! Let's go fight!

02:17:10.100 --> 02:17:10.980
Hey, what do you want?

02:17:10.980 --> 02:17:11.740
Get a little!

02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:12.900
Here comes the gang!

02:17:12.900 --> 02:17:13.400
Let's go!

02:17:13.900 --> 02:17:14.540
Woah-haa!

02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:15.060
Yaah!

02:17:15.060 --> 02:17:15.560
Oah!

02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:16.060
Aah!

02:17:16.060 --> 02:17:16.560
Aah!

02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:17.060
Ooh!

02:17:17.060 --> 02:17:17.560
Aah!

02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:18.060
Aah!

02:17:18.060 --> 02:17:18.560
Woohoo!

02:17:18.560 --> 02:17:19.060
Aah!

02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:19.560
Aah!

02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:20.060
Aah!

02:17:20.060 --> 02:17:20.560
Aah!

02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:21.060
Woohoo!

02:17:21.060 --> 02:17:21.560
Aah!

02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:22.060
Aah!

02:17:22.260 --> 02:17:22.760
Aah!

02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:23.260
Ooh!

02:17:23.260 --> 02:17:23.760
Aah!

02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:24.260
Aah!

02:17:24.260 --> 02:17:24.760
Aah!

02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:25.260
Hey! Hey! Hey!

02:17:25.260 --> 02:17:27.260
Hey! Hey! Hey!

02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:35.260
Blood

02:17:35.260 --> 02:17:38.260
Deep broken glass on the floor

02:17:40.260 --> 02:17:44.260
And if the fight's right, the fighters just might decide to be friends and make amends

02:17:44.260 --> 02:17:48.260
And as we get closer to the end, it's time to sing the chorus once again!

02:17:48.260 --> 02:17:52.260
And the arms like they're freaky, I can take the whole life better!

02:17:52.260 --> 02:18:12.140
Hey, now we've got a special request. One more song here. This is over the email request,

02:18:12.140 --> 02:18:19.140
So this is for Yumi, Tyra, that would like to hear some highs off you, so here you go.

02:18:42.140 --> 02:18:46.140
Higher than higher

02:18:46.140 --> 02:18:50.140
I'll take you higher

02:18:50.140 --> 02:18:52.140
Stop screaming and try to look hard

02:18:52.140 --> 02:18:53.140
I give my body up, you did that retard

02:18:53.140 --> 02:18:55.140
I'm a veteran, which means that I've been

02:18:55.140 --> 02:18:57.140
In the game too long since the days of X-Men

02:18:57.140 --> 02:18:59.140
Way back when, I've been putting it down

02:18:59.140 --> 02:19:01.140
Ask the homie who's the baddest, get your wrist out of town

02:19:01.140 --> 02:19:03.140
I'm so like a butterfly, sing like a meme

02:19:03.140 --> 02:19:04.140
Spectacular over M-I-C

02:19:04.140 --> 02:19:06.140
I don't provoke, never giving it less than the best

02:19:06.140 --> 02:19:08.140
Rock the ears in the game, that's your request

02:19:08.140 --> 02:19:10.140
You like to rhyme, break into jail

02:19:10.140 --> 02:19:12.140
I kick a pecker so I don't care

02:19:12.140 --> 02:19:14.140
Why that's me, seem a victim to me

02:19:14.140 --> 02:19:16.140
What a real MC is supposed to be

02:19:16.140 --> 02:19:18.140
Fucking duck every time that I drop it

02:19:18.140 --> 02:19:20.140
Rock-a-boom-a, baby, I don't need such a spot

02:19:20.140 --> 02:19:22.140
I got the beat and the ride

02:19:22.140 --> 02:19:24.140
Rock the party, rock the party, rock the party

02:19:24.140 --> 02:19:28.140
Higher than higher

02:19:28.140 --> 02:19:32.140
I'm doing it like fire

02:19:32.140 --> 02:19:36.140
Higher than higher

02:19:36.140 --> 02:20:03.180
We, indeed, welcome back to Orange Lawns Radio, episode number 30.

02:20:03.180 --> 02:20:04.180
Do it again.

02:20:04.180 --> 02:20:05.180
Live.

02:20:05.180 --> 02:20:10.460
We didn't even really talk about this. This is episode number 30. We're over the hill now.

02:20:10.460 --> 02:20:11.820
No, that's 40.

02:20:11.820 --> 02:20:13.340
Over the hill is 40. Sorry, my bad.

02:20:13.340 --> 02:20:15.980
Well, when I hit 30, I'm going to be crying because I think I'm over the hill.

02:20:15.980 --> 02:20:17.180
We're at our sexual peak.

02:20:17.180 --> 02:20:21.020
Yes, we're at our sexual peak. Oh, that's what's happening to this show tonight. I get it.

02:20:21.020 --> 02:20:26.380
Orange Lawn's radio is at its female sexual peak.

02:20:26.380 --> 02:20:29.500
Yeah, I've been there and back.

02:20:29.500 --> 02:20:30.940
You mean you've done a 30-year-old?

02:20:30.940 --> 02:20:33.580
You've done a 30-year-old?

02:20:33.580 --> 02:20:37.540
No. Would you?

02:20:37.540 --> 02:20:40.860
Talking about women here, right? Yes.

02:20:40.860 --> 02:20:43.900
Maybe. If she was hot enough.

02:20:43.900 --> 02:20:47.180
I did one that was 28, does that count? No. Oh, okay.

02:20:47.180 --> 02:20:51.700
I was 17. No, I'm kidding, I was 15. She may not necessarily be hot,

02:20:51.700 --> 02:20:55.740
but was incredibly skilled.

02:20:55.740 --> 02:21:00.240
Room's dark enough to hang. She swallows, Loki, she swallows. Did you ever see that

02:21:00.240 --> 02:21:02.240
What was that show that was on HBO?

02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:04.240
To be honest, I don't even give a shit about it.

02:21:04.240 --> 02:21:09.240
No, not real sex. It had the guy who was a writer and his wife left him and married a politician.

02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:12.240
And he was in the hospital one time, blinded.

02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:17.240
And he did this one nurse, and the nurse was, you know, really good and everything.

02:21:17.240 --> 02:21:20.240
He got his vision back and she was like 50.

02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:24.240
You know, but see, now the whole thing with the swallowing, I don't even get that.

02:21:24.240 --> 02:21:27.240
I mean, who cares? That sucks.

02:21:27.240 --> 02:21:31.240
Okay, she gets the best out of both worlds. She gets to eat and she gets to have sex.

02:21:31.240 --> 02:21:33.240
What the fuck is up with that?

02:21:33.240 --> 02:21:40.240
If I could have a pizza and be getting head at the same time, man, I'd be the happiest guy in the world, man.

02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:43.240
You're eating pizza? Hey, good job.

02:21:43.240 --> 02:21:46.240
You know what? I don't see why people are so fascinated with that.

02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:49.240
I don't even understand that. It's stupid. It's like, oh, I smell it.

02:21:49.240 --> 02:21:55.240
I want to know what the advantage of putting something in your mouth that a guy pisses with.

02:21:55.240 --> 02:21:55.740
OK.

02:21:58.440 --> 02:22:03.160
Well, it goes both ways, you know.

02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:07.920
All right.

02:22:07.920 --> 02:22:11.520
We're going to do a segment here that we did a couple of weeks

02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:12.640
ago that everybody loved.

02:22:12.640 --> 02:22:14.240
So we're doing it again.

02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:15.720
It's called Ask Orange Lounge.

02:22:15.720 --> 02:22:17.440
That's right.

02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:20.120
You can send us your questions over private message

02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:22.560
to me in the chat room right now.

02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:25.440
And we'll answer them live here on air.

02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:29.280
We're going to start with a question from USFBB, who says,

02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:33.400
I am trying to compile a list of places to have sex.

02:22:33.400 --> 02:22:35.800
OrangeLoungeCast, please help me.

02:22:35.800 --> 02:22:39.360
And I wanted to clarify, he is in Vegas, and he says yes.

02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:41.920
And he already has listed at the Tropicana

02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:44.080
because they have mirrors on the ceiling in every room.

02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:45.680
So the Tropicana is taken care of.

02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:50.080
So places the USFBB needs to have sex?

02:22:50.080 --> 02:22:50.920
In Vegas.

02:22:50.920 --> 02:22:52.200
I've never been to Vegas.

02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:54.200
I've never been to Vegas. I've been to Vegas.

02:22:54.200 --> 02:22:58.200
You need to have sex at Gypsy.

02:22:58.200 --> 02:23:01.200
Hopefully he catches the reference.

02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:05.200
What's that place that was in Shoot Girls?

02:23:05.200 --> 02:23:07.200
The Cheetah.

02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:08.200
Yeah, you need to get a lap dance at the Cheetah.

02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:11.200
Okay, you need to get a lap dance at the Cheetah.

02:23:11.200 --> 02:23:14.200
And then run a nice room at the Monte Carlo.

02:23:14.200 --> 02:23:16.200
Okay.

02:23:16.200 --> 02:23:18.200
Yeah, Monte Carlo's good.

02:23:18.200 --> 02:23:20.200
What else do you need to do for sex?

02:23:20.200 --> 02:23:26.200
There's so many whorehouses. You know what? You need to have sex in the desert next to a cactus. I think that would be fun.

02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:32.200
I'm gonna eat it. Eat some peyote and then have sex.

02:23:32.200 --> 02:23:35.200
Okay, cool. You get some free sex flyers too. That would be cool.

02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:40.200
You can get those cards that have the transgender women on there.

02:23:40.200 --> 02:23:44.200
Yes, you need to have sex with somebody transgender. That would work.

02:23:44.200 --> 02:23:51.200
You know how they have those lunch carts where they punch them and stuff? You need to get one of those for a prostitute, because that'd be hilarious.

02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:53.200
Okay, cool.

02:23:53.200 --> 02:24:01.200
Where else in Vegas does he need to have sex? How about on top of that spinning guitar at the Hard Rock Hotel?

02:24:01.200 --> 02:24:04.200
The basement at the Excalibur.

02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:06.200
The basement of the Excalibur.

02:24:06.200 --> 02:24:08.200
On the Technomotion Machine.

02:24:08.200 --> 02:24:09.200
Ah, okay, on the Technomotion Machine.

02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:10.200
Emotion.

02:24:10.200 --> 02:24:20.200
You know what? You need to have sex at Caesar's Palace in the forums, like on the fountain with the animatronic Neptune guy. That's where you need to have sex.

02:24:20.200 --> 02:24:22.200
On top of the pirate ship that burns.

02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:26.200
Yes! On a pirate ship in Treasure Island. Good, good one.

02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:29.200
Go on the one that sinks while it's sinking.

02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:35.200
Have sex on the sinking boat at Treasure Island. That's our answer. That's where you need to have sex.

02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:37.200
Alright. Hope that helped.

02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:42.200
Black Lab asks, Puppy wants to know

02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:45.320
based on everyone that we've met on this show

02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:49.480
if everyone there in Channel Orange Lounge

02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:54.720
and the studio were to get into a big fight, who would win? I'm not sure I quite

02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:55.920
understand that question

02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:59.720
are you saying everybody in the chat room currently versus the three of us?

02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:03.680
or you need to clarify who's fighting? That's what we need to know

02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:09.680
Who exactly is fighting here? We don't know who's winning unless we know who's fighting.

02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:17.680
Of our guests, I'd probably say that Melody would win.

02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:21.680
Which Melody? We've had two Melodies. We had Angel Melody and then we had Mel B's girlfriend Melody.

02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:22.680
Why'd you do?

02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:24.680
Okay, so that would be Shark's Girl Melody, yes?

02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:25.680
Because she's badass.

02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:27.680
Oh no, I think she's badass.

02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:28.680
Alright.

02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:31.680
Of us, I would win.

02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:33.680
Wait, the three of us got in a fight? You mean you would win?

02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:35.680
All I have to do is kick both of you in the balls.

02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:37.680
We could kick you in the boob.

02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:40.680
You've got two of them. One foot each.

02:25:40.680 --> 02:25:42.680
Yeah, but you know what? Guys see that coming right away.

02:25:42.680 --> 02:25:44.680
I mean, this is like a big target.

02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:46.680
Just say, hit me here.

02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:48.680
I mean, we're expecting that, okay?

02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:51.680
I'll smack you both in my purse if I have the time.

02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:53.680
Whatever.

02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:55.680
Yeah, we need to know who's fighting.

02:25:55.680 --> 02:25:56.680
So Black Lab Cl-

02:25:56.680 --> 02:25:58.680
Uh, everyone for themselves.

02:25:58.680 --> 02:25:59.680
Ah, I see.

02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:06.920
so let's see I would say who would who would lose who would lose the fight

02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:15.680
first you think that's true yes that would that would be to lose shine lose

02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:20.520
right there of the folks in there right now you know what I think I think Chubbs

02:26:20.520 --> 02:26:24.480
would kick a lot of ass yeah I think Chubbs would lay the smack down I think

02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:27.480
How did he go to come down all the chubs in Mel B?

02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:33.480
Mel's not in the chat right now, but he's been on the show before. I think that's where the fight would come down.

02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:37.480
I think Wendell would kick some ass, too.

02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:39.480
Dude, Wendell would kick all kinds of ass.

02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:45.480
That's true, but Wendell's never been... Oh, Wendell's been in the segments, on the interview segments, so I guess that counts.

02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:52.480
Dude, but I think that overall, Jahi would own everybody, just the personality alone.

02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:54.480
Drew, Jahi would yell everybody to death.

02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:56.480
Yeah.

02:26:56.480 --> 02:26:58.480
He's my great defender anyway.

02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:03.480
Alright, so that's your answer. That's who'd win a fight.

02:27:03.480 --> 02:27:07.480
Alright, moving along here with Ask Orange Lounge.

02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:09.480
We're running out of questions. We need more.

02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:10.480
Yeah, question us.

02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:14.480
You can also send us questions over email to orangeloungeradio.yahoo.com

02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:18.480
and we'll answer those live on air as well.

02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:21.480
Remember, if you ask a personal question, we don't necessarily have to answer.

02:27:21.480 --> 02:27:28.480
If you ask a really, really personal question, we may not answer, or we'll make something up.

02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:33.480
Okay. Ah! There's an interesting question from Shadow.

02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:36.480
Speaking of personal questions...

02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:44.480
Jamie, what is the best position for giving the chicks the best sexual satisfaction?

02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:48.480
Jamie continues doing her nails.

02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:50.480
Are you gonna answer it, or are you gonna tell him to?

02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:52.480
The mechanical one.

02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:54.480
Oh!

02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:58.480
So basically guys are incapable, so give it up.

02:27:58.480 --> 02:27:59.480
Yeah.

02:27:59.480 --> 02:28:00.480
Okay.

02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:05.480
I don't think a guy can pleasure a woman as well as she can figure out how to pleasure herself.

02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:07.480
Oh! Zing!

02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:10.480
You would think that, yeah of course.

02:28:10.480 --> 02:28:12.480
Apparently...

02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:31.480
I agree with you there about porn being a comedy, that's just fun.

02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:35.480
It's like, why try to inject plot with something that really needs none?

02:28:35.480 --> 02:28:37.480
That's what I think.

02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:41.480
Because it's funny.

02:28:41.480 --> 02:28:45.480
Alright, moving on. We have another question from EOSFBB.

02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:50.480
He has on his list, his list of places he wants to have sex, he says sex and a confessional.

02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:53.480
Good kinkiness or morally wrong? Well...

02:28:53.480 --> 02:28:56.480
Well, they had that contest going on the radio a while back.

02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:01.480
I was going to say, Opie and Anthony, remember those kids? They got kicked off the air for that shit, so...

02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:03.480
We can't really answer that, because we don't want to get...

02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:05.480
Oh wait, we're on the internet. We can do whatever the fuck we want.

02:29:05.480 --> 02:29:09.480
Go fuck in the changing room that the priests use.

02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:12.480
Ah, that's better than the confessional.

02:29:12.480 --> 02:29:14.480
You might walk in on them with a little boy or something.

02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:16.480
Use the pew.

02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:18.480
Sex in a pew?

02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:20.480
Probably there would be pew.

02:29:20.480 --> 02:29:22.480
I would be afraid to have sex in a church.

02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:26.480
I think the problem with sex in a church is that I wouldn't be able to get it up.

02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:29.480
I'd be too afraid of, like, lightning hitting me.

02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:31.480
Okay.

02:29:31.480 --> 02:29:33.480
We both just stare at each other.

02:29:33.480 --> 02:29:34.480
Blink, blink, blink.

02:29:34.480 --> 02:29:36.480
All right. See, that's the thing.

02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:37.480
I don't think you can have sex in a church.

02:29:37.480 --> 02:29:41.480
I don't think he'd be able to get it up, but if he can, hey, you're weird.

02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:47.480
Alright. Oh, uh, Stresso would like to point out he hasn't gotten any complaints.

02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:50.480
But have you gotten compliments?

02:29:50.480 --> 02:29:58.480
Yeah, uh, that's the thing. Women a lot of times, you know, they're not gonna see anything because they're afraid that, you know, that they'll hurt your feelings or something.

02:29:58.480 --> 02:29:59.980
And then again there's those women that are like,

02:29:59.980 --> 02:30:01.480
You fucking suck!

02:30:01.480 --> 02:30:02.980
But, um...

02:30:02.980 --> 02:30:04.980
Yeah, um...

02:30:04.980 --> 02:30:06.980
I don't know, just do this, okay?

02:30:06.980 --> 02:30:08.980
It looks like she's liking it.

02:30:08.980 --> 02:30:10.480
Keep doing what you're doing.

02:30:10.480 --> 02:30:13.480
If she doesn't like it, or it doesn't look like she's enjoying herself,

02:30:13.480 --> 02:30:15.480
I mean, and you should be able to tell.

02:30:15.480 --> 02:30:17.480
I mean, none of this, like, she's faking shit.

02:30:17.480 --> 02:30:19.480
No, you can tell, okay?

02:30:19.480 --> 02:30:21.480
Tell if she's liking it, then, uh...

02:30:21.480 --> 02:30:23.980
If something's not working, then try something else.

02:30:23.980 --> 02:30:27.980
Just experiment, you'll eventually find something that, you know, works really good.

02:30:27.980 --> 02:30:30.980
And just keep doing that. You can only get better.

02:30:57.980 --> 02:31:00.480
Oh yeah, listen under stationlive.org. They're back on the air now.

02:31:00.480 --> 02:31:05.480
I can do Bomani stuff. We've got only like one more thing to talk about. Hold on, then I have to stop the music.

02:31:07.480 --> 02:31:13.480
Okay, the only other Bomani thing that actually happened this week, the only thing that happened, actually two things.

02:31:13.480 --> 02:31:26.480
Internet ranking for DDR Extreme came up, yay, and they found out if you play Paranoid Rebirth, get double A, play Paranoid Evolution, get double A, then you get to play Paranoid Survivor Max in DDR Extreme.

02:31:26.480 --> 02:31:27.480
That's about it.

02:31:27.480 --> 02:31:29.480
Okay, back to the ask questions thing.

02:31:29.480 --> 02:31:31.480
All right, ask questions. Here we go, we got another question.

02:31:32.480 --> 02:31:34.480
Hooray for people saving this segment.

02:31:35.480 --> 02:31:38.480
Black Lab wants to... Oh, God damn it.

02:31:38.480 --> 02:31:42.480
When is someone going to kidnap me and take me to Scandia for 2DX?

02:31:42.480 --> 02:31:44.480
Um, soon?

02:31:44.480 --> 02:31:46.480
Never.

02:31:46.480 --> 02:31:48.480
No, I don't know.

02:31:49.480 --> 02:31:51.480
You know, come to think of it...

02:31:51.480 --> 02:32:07.480
Black Lap, plan on next weekend, if you can do it. Because what's happening, I'm going to Milpitas on Friday night, I'm going to a tournament there, and I'm staying with a friend over in the Bay Area Friday night, and then I'm going to be... By the way, I'll be doing interviews at the Milpitas tournament on Friday.

02:32:07.480 --> 02:32:10.480
Next weekend, next Friday?

02:32:10.480 --> 02:32:11.480
Yeah.

02:32:11.480 --> 02:32:12.480
You know what next Friday is?

02:32:12.480 --> 02:32:13.480
What's that?

02:32:13.480 --> 02:32:16.480
It's Loki's Head to Contest number four!

02:32:43.480 --> 02:32:50.120
I'm going to be going and then I'm going to be coming back on Saturday so I can swing

02:32:50.120 --> 02:32:54.320
by Davis and get you on Saturday if you want and we'll go to Scania on Sunday.

02:32:54.320 --> 02:32:57.400
I just thought of a guest who could kick everybody's ass.

02:32:57.400 --> 02:32:58.400
What's that?

02:32:58.400 --> 02:32:59.400
Shermie!

02:32:59.400 --> 02:33:00.400
Shermie has been a guest on the show.

02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:04.440
Do you think Shermie would claw Chubbs to death even?

02:33:04.440 --> 02:33:05.440
She would out-cute him.

02:33:05.440 --> 02:33:06.440
Oh!

02:33:06.440 --> 02:33:07.440
And then Shermie would kick their ass.

02:33:07.440 --> 02:33:08.440
That's interesting.

02:33:08.440 --> 02:33:09.440
No!

02:33:09.440 --> 02:33:10.440
Cute.

02:33:10.440 --> 02:33:11.440
Alright.

02:33:11.440 --> 02:33:12.640
Alright.

02:33:12.640 --> 02:33:15.800
Shermie's the cutest guest we've ever had on the show, and you weren't here.

02:33:15.800 --> 02:33:17.600
I know, I wasn't here, I'm sorry.

02:33:17.600 --> 02:33:22.880
The one that was on the show at my house was Shermie, and she parted on the microphone.

02:33:22.880 --> 02:33:26.320
She parted on the microphone? She purred!

02:33:26.320 --> 02:33:29.080
My pussy.

02:33:29.080 --> 02:33:32.560
People have met my Shermie.

02:33:32.560 --> 02:33:37.960
My baby. My cat is cute, right?

02:33:37.960 --> 02:33:39.440
Alright.

02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:42.960
moving on ice as stress agrees to use the cutest pussy he's ever seen

02:33:42.960 --> 02:33:47.520
yes alright more questions

02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:51.000
23rd maggots all he's got a money related question beautiful

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:55.080
what are some of the easiest cat us I have for so far and I want to get more

02:33:55.080 --> 02:33:55.760
under my bar

02:33:55.760 --> 02:33:58.800
belt the question being cockamamie I feel

02:33:58.800 --> 02:34:03.080
I feel I'm not a crisis in not a crisis my summer love

02:34:03.080 --> 02:34:06.480
I think I think especially speeded up

02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:10.480
Um, yeah, well then do you think I'm a Ryan78 cat?

02:34:10.480 --> 02:34:15.480
Um, just about all the ones in Maxis that stay in Sodeep.

02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:16.480
Which I'm close to Sodeep.

02:34:16.480 --> 02:34:18.480
Twilight Zone, maybe not.

02:34:18.480 --> 02:34:21.480
I would say Twilight Zone. Of course it depends.

02:34:21.480 --> 02:34:24.480
It depends if you, because there's two types of people.

02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:27.480
There's the people that can get the weird rhythms really easy.

02:34:27.480 --> 02:34:32.480
So if you're that type of person you can get a Ryan78, I feel those kind of cat is no problem.

02:34:32.480 --> 02:34:41.480
But then there's the stamina kind of people, who they don't really sometimes get the weird rhythms, but they got so much stamina they can run and run and run, and for them, easy caddas would be like Afronova.

02:34:42.480 --> 02:34:51.480
But then you get those caddas that are both like Rhythm and Police, or so deep, and then you're just fucked. So those are like the last ones you'll probably pass.

02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:54.480
I have issues with my stamina, partly from my asthma and having a bad knee and a bad ankle.

02:34:55.480 --> 02:34:56.480
First cadda you guys ever passed?

02:34:56.480 --> 02:34:57.480
Hypnotic Crisis.

02:34:57.480 --> 02:34:58.480
Same here, Hypnotic Crisis.

02:34:58.480 --> 02:35:00.480
What was the first cadda you ever passed, Libby?

02:35:00.480 --> 02:35:04.480
First Cata I passed was on Doubles, and that was Make Your Move.

02:35:04.480 --> 02:35:07.480
Make Your Move. Really? That was a Cata?

02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:08.480
That's a Cata. That'd be damned.

02:35:08.480 --> 02:35:10.480
Okay, second Cata you guys passed, do you remember?

02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:12.480
Gratias Excivor.

02:35:12.480 --> 02:35:13.480
Mine was Orion 7A.

02:35:14.480 --> 02:35:15.480
La Senorita.

02:35:15.480 --> 02:35:16.480
Doubles.

02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:17.480
Doubles? What was the first-

02:35:17.480 --> 02:35:20.480
I was better at Doubles than I was Singles for the longest time.

02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:22.480
What was the first Singles Cata you passed?

02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:23.480
I don't know if I remember.

02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:25.480
I think it was Dead End.

02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:25.480
Ah, okay.

02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:26.480
Oh, no, no, no!

02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:28.480
No, I do remember the easiest one to pass.

02:35:28.480 --> 02:35:31.480
Paranoid Eternal, but with the 5th mix steps were heavy.

02:35:31.480 --> 02:35:33.480
Ah, okay. Paranoid Eternal on 5th mix.

02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:36.480
I know my 10th mix. Lupin, remember?

02:35:36.480 --> 02:35:39.480
Lupin, yeah. I don't think Lupin's that easy, though.

02:35:39.480 --> 02:35:41.480
We're at the party at, um...

02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:42.480
Compared to other guys.

02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:44.480
...compared to our old 5th money parties back at the old...

02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:47.480
I mean, we're so old school that every cat is easy now, but...

02:35:47.480 --> 02:35:49.480
...on a home pad, on a modded home pad.

02:35:49.480 --> 02:35:52.480
Went back, um, a couple days later, and, uh...

02:35:52.480 --> 02:35:56.480
No, that was actually right before, um, the, uh, NGL 2.

02:35:56.480 --> 02:36:00.480
I think the hardest katas are the ones that were on third base, actually.

02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:03.480
I completely agree.

02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:13.480
Well, they upgraded Paranoia Clean and End of the Century. I beat both of those.

02:36:13.480 --> 02:36:15.480
Oh, yeah, the ones they up to are nice.

02:36:15.480 --> 02:36:17.480
I beat Dead End. It actually took me out of the game.

02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:21.480
Roke in my heart's the easiest kata.

02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:31.480
And I actually did legitimately get Captain Jack.

02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:53.480
I don't know, it was a pain in the ass for me for some reason.

02:37:21.480 --> 02:37:26.480
I agree. I think that's by far the easiest cata currently.

02:37:26.480 --> 02:37:31.480
If you do have good stamina, though, Wanda is actually not a bad one.

02:37:31.480 --> 02:37:36.480
What's up, Brad?

02:37:36.480 --> 02:37:38.480
First cata you ever passed?

02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:43.480
I don't know because I never kept track of that shit. I just beat everything.

02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:48.480
Oh, you're so leet!

02:37:48.480 --> 02:37:52.480
My first seven, though, was Let Them Move.

02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:53.480
What was Dead End?

02:37:53.480 --> 02:37:54.480
Dead End's a nine.

02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:57.480
Oh, okay, because I beat that way.

02:37:57.480 --> 02:38:03.480
A lot of people did, though. It was harder for me, but I think it was a good examination.

02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:09.480
One of the ones that I was really amazed I could get was Breakdown, though, because of the speed.

02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:12.480
Another real easy one would be Paranoid Clean Mix.

02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:15.480
Yes.

02:38:15.480 --> 02:38:18.480
But I remember when that was just an age.

02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:20.480
It was like, I feel...

02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:22.480
I feel so insane.

02:38:22.480 --> 02:38:27.480
I don't know why people complain about it, because it actually does follow a path.

02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:49.480
After the Game of Love.

02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:59.080
any erotic song or secret rendezvous what mix we don't know what mix they're

02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:03.480
gonna do a freestyle routine where they fuck on the DDR pad oh no I'm sorry I'm

02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:07.320
sorry it's not a freestyle routine they're gonna star in a porno

02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:12.320
Let's see... I would like to hear...

02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:14.320
T-Love.

02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:17.320
Yeah, T-Love would be pretty good, but I have to get Orion.

02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:19.320
How about Boom Boom Dollar?

02:39:19.320 --> 02:39:20.320
Cause you could, you know, thrust on the rhythm.

02:39:20.320 --> 02:39:22.320
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:23.320
And then he could, like, be lip syncing to it.

02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:24.320
It would be Pink Dinosaur.

02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:25.320
Mighty Fine Dollar.

02:39:25.320 --> 02:39:27.320
No, Pink Dinosaur.

02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:29.320
Because it's about a penis.

02:39:29.320 --> 02:39:31.320
Or, um, no, no, Walkie Talkie.

02:39:31.320 --> 02:39:33.320
Just have, okay.

02:39:33.320 --> 02:39:38.320
Multiple music, multiple different songs for each different scene. You're gonna have Blow My Whistle Bitch for the oral name.

02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:39.320
Oh, Blow My Whistle Bitch!

02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:45.320
Well, this is the thing, this is the thing. The OSFPB, he gave me the mix. They're gonna try to close Game Land and do it, and use DDREX.

02:39:45.320 --> 02:39:47.320
So he can't do Blow My Whistle Bitch, that's not an EX.

02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:52.320
I can say, all I can say is, I'm not gonna do a handclap on that machine ever again.

02:39:52.320 --> 02:39:54.320
Yeah, right, like, okay, what the fuck did our game's gonna-

02:39:54.320 --> 02:39:56.320
Oh yeah, go ahead, shoot a porno here.

02:39:56.320 --> 02:39:57.320
Never know!

02:39:57.320 --> 02:39:58.320
You never know!

02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:00.320
He might be friends with the owner.

02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:04.320
Don't you think Keith would let us shoot a porno?

02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:06.320
No?

02:40:06.320 --> 02:40:08.320
All right, maybe not.

02:40:08.320 --> 02:40:10.320
Tandyos Family Entertainment.

02:40:10.320 --> 02:40:12.320
Anyway, next question.

02:40:12.320 --> 02:40:13.320
All right, next question.

02:40:13.320 --> 02:40:15.320
We gave you plenty of good songs to choose from, Pikmin.

02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:17.320
I still say butterfly.

02:40:17.320 --> 02:40:19.320
All right.

02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:22.320
Stressa says, I was playing AM radio today.

02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:23.320
I hit a 200 combo.

02:40:23.320 --> 02:40:25.320
I swear to God, this blue thing kind of reminded me of Tickman.

02:40:25.320 --> 02:40:26.320
The Tick, whatever his name is.

02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:33.320
jump out from the right side of the screen and screeched at me. What the fuck was that? Or is that something standard to an only course?

02:40:56.320 --> 02:40:58.960
Cacento, which is the blue thing that you were talking about.

02:40:58.960 --> 02:41:07.960
They also have one with Ver2, wearing the DDR pad, and the helmet.

02:41:07.960 --> 02:41:09.360
It's hilarious.

02:41:09.360 --> 02:41:11.040
But yeah, that's part of the new DDR.

02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:14.160
That's the SM Extreme skin for that one.

02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:15.440
But that one's pretty funny.

02:41:15.440 --> 02:41:19.080
You still need to have an orange lounge skin first, I mean.

02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:19.720
Don't look at me.

02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:20.520
I'm not making one.

02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:21.080
Why not?

02:41:21.080 --> 02:41:23.760
Because I'm one easy, and I don't do skins.

02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:25.080
That's true.

02:41:25.080 --> 02:41:29.080
I can't even finish my one-step mania file I tried to make.

02:41:29.080 --> 02:41:31.080
I'm gonna finish it and call it mine.

02:41:31.080 --> 02:41:33.080
No, bastard.

02:41:33.080 --> 02:41:35.080
Yeah.

02:41:35.080 --> 02:41:37.080
Insertion.

02:41:37.080 --> 02:41:40.080
Insertion? What about it?

02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:43.080
Yeah, but insertion I think.

02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:45.080
Every time I listen to insertion, I'm thinking it's boring.

02:41:45.080 --> 02:41:49.080
It just sounds like boring music. It's got, like, a lot of bass.

02:41:49.080 --> 02:41:50.080
You got the girl going,

02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:54.080
Oh! Oh! Oh, Naoki, your tiny penis is so good!

02:41:57.080 --> 02:41:58.080
Well, if there's not a pair of parrot machines...

02:41:58.080 --> 02:41:59.080
More questions!

02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:01.080
Yes, I'm getting to more questions. Here we go.

02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:04.080
They're correcting you in the chat room, Loki. It was slim, not for two.

02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:05.080
It's not worth it to do your bed.

02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:07.080
Whatever.

02:42:09.080 --> 02:42:11.080
Uh, DarkTetsuya has a question.

02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:15.080
Will RedHotLive by Vanessa May ever make it into rotation?

02:42:15.080 --> 02:42:17.080
If someone would send me the goddamn file...

02:42:17.080 --> 02:42:18.080
I have it.

02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:20.080
You better copy that for me.

02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:22.080
DCC me that later.

02:42:22.080 --> 02:42:24.080
Alright, I'll DCC it to Jamie.

02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:26.080
We play around fuck-offs occasionally. Isn't that good enough?

02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:29.080
Isn't shit we do here good enough for you? Jesus.

02:42:31.080 --> 02:42:34.080
I don't know, Brad wasn't here. That's the part where Brad's supposed to go. Where?

02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:36.080
We'll think about it.

02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:40.080
We have no more questions. We're out of questions.

02:42:41.080 --> 02:42:44.080
You have a question, Jamie? You want to ask OrangeLawn off something?

02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:45.080
I want to ask our chair a question.

02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:51.080
Oh, you want to... Ooh, reverse! I like this! Alright, fine. When they don't ask us questions, we're going to ask them questions.

02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:54.080
Why won't you ask us another question?

02:42:54.080 --> 02:42:56.080
Come on, I thought you were going to ask them something good.

02:42:56.080 --> 02:43:01.080
I want you to send me... I want you to send me some nice yowie.

02:43:01.080 --> 02:43:05.080
Okay. Where should they email that to?

02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:08.080
DarkSakuraIdolo.com

02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:11.080
Alright, here we go. More questions.

02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:15.080
That wasn't a question. Stresses says he still loves us.

02:43:15.080 --> 02:43:17.080
Uh, he better.

02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:20.080
Ah-ha! Good question from Black Lab. Very good question.

02:43:20.080 --> 02:43:26.080
Black Lab wants to know when they're gonna see some hot monkey sex on the show.

02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:28.080
Where's the ferret?

02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:30.080
I don't know where the ferret is.

02:43:30.080 --> 02:43:31.080
Where's the ferret?

02:43:31.080 --> 02:43:33.080
Did somebody kidnap the ferret?

02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:36.080
Where's the ferret?

02:43:37.080 --> 02:43:40.080
Oh my god, the ferret's gone. Is it up here?

02:43:40.080 --> 02:43:41.080
You have a Furby.

02:43:41.080 --> 02:43:43.080
Yeah, I know I have a Furby.

02:43:43.080 --> 02:43:45.080
I don't know where the ferret went.

02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:46.080
We're going to have to...

02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:47.080
The ferret is missing.

02:43:49.080 --> 02:43:51.080
Okay, we're going to have to find the ferret.

02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:54.080
When will we have hot monkey sex on this show?

02:43:56.080 --> 02:43:58.080
We'll see what we can do.

02:44:00.080 --> 02:44:02.080
Maybe I'll go to the zoo and try to take some sex.

02:44:02.080 --> 02:44:04.080
Dude, you saw the orangutans having sex.

02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:06.080
You saw the orangutans having sex?

02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:07.080
Yeah, I saw turtles.

02:44:07.080 --> 02:44:09.080
You saw turtles fucking?

02:44:09.080 --> 02:44:12.080
Yeah, Julian and I went for a school assignment, and I saw turtles fucking.

02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:13.080
How was that?

02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:14.080
Slow.

02:44:15.080 --> 02:44:21.080
See, it was really neat. See, the male turtle is standing up, leaning on the shell of the female turtle, go,

02:44:21.080 --> 02:44:25.080
wump, wump, wump.

02:44:25.080 --> 02:44:27.080
Did he make a wump sound when he did it?

02:44:27.080 --> 02:44:34.080
No, but it was, like, that slow. It was like, one, two.

02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:37.080
It was neat, though, because it was turtle fire.

02:44:37.080 --> 02:44:38.080
Hahaha!

02:44:38.080 --> 02:44:40.080
We played and it went squeal!

02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:42.080
Turtle-fucking-yeah!

02:44:42.080 --> 02:44:44.080
Alright, more questions.

02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:47.080
Alright, Stressa!

02:44:47.080 --> 02:44:49.080
I thought we saw all the lemurs doing it.

02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:53.080
That's not a question. It's an order.

02:44:53.080 --> 02:44:54.080
What?

02:44:54.080 --> 02:44:56.080
Stressa, it's this next drunk show. Let the hot sex begin.

02:44:56.080 --> 02:44:57.080
No!

02:44:57.080 --> 02:44:58.080
No!

02:44:58.080 --> 02:45:00.080
Dan won't be here.

02:45:02.080 --> 02:45:04.080
Go on the ferret!

02:45:04.080 --> 02:45:13.360

When you're in love, you'll dance along again

02:47:58.580 --> 02:48:02.580
It's not like I want to leave you here

02:48:02.580 --> 02:48:06.580
And I'll be your one more

02:48:06.580 --> 02:48:09.580
Don't want me to say I love you

02:48:09.580 --> 02:48:13.580
I'll be your, I'll be your, I'll be your happy wedding

02:48:13.580 --> 02:48:17.580
I'll be your, I'll be your, I'll take you here every day

02:48:47.580 --> 02:49:01.840

02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:09.480
I see you I see you I see you

02:50:09.480 --> 02:50:12.480
We gotta get up, don't you think?

02:53:12.480 --> 02:53:24.920
Oh, apps!

02:53:24.920 --> 02:53:28.800
This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

02:53:28.800 --> 02:53:33.840
Hi, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:53:33.840 --> 02:53:37.440
Look, you wanted to talk about how he's going to be famous.

02:53:37.440 --> 02:54:05.760
The song that we played the last song before we came back was Dancer, which by the way

02:54:05.760 --> 02:54:09.140
is the best 2DX8 style video ever.

02:54:09.140 --> 02:54:13.960
And we were talking during the break about, because some of you out there have been demanding

02:54:13.960 --> 02:54:18.040
that we update our website with our bios, because they haven't been up for a while.

02:54:18.040 --> 02:54:19.840
Loki has never had a bio on the site.

02:54:19.840 --> 02:54:24.840
I'm sorry, I need a picture of me with my real nose and not a photoshopped nose.

02:54:24.840 --> 02:54:28.040
You have to admit though, Glenn did interesting work with those.

02:54:28.040 --> 02:54:29.040
Interesting.

02:54:29.040 --> 02:54:33.760
I didn't look anything like you, excuse me, I don't look like I'm made out of plastic.

02:54:33.760 --> 02:54:35.760
Yeah, they did look like we were made out of plastic.

02:54:35.760 --> 02:54:37.760
And I don't have a Barbra Streisand nose.

02:54:37.760 --> 02:54:38.760
I had a big nose too, hey.

02:54:38.760 --> 02:54:43.760
Well anyway, we're going to take some new pictures of ourselves and we're talking about which 2DX videos we're going to parody to do the pictures of.

02:54:43.760 --> 02:54:46.760
I don't want to parody a 2DX video, I don't play 2DX.

02:54:46.760 --> 02:54:49.760
Well we're just going to dress you up like a pimp because you're the porn king.

02:54:49.760 --> 02:54:51.760
I'm not a porn king, I don't even own that much.

02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:53.760
Shut up, you're the porn king.

02:54:53.760 --> 02:55:00.760
Okay chat room, chat room, how are we dressing, I want chat room to vote then. How are we dressing up Loki for his picture on the bio page?

02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:05.760
We already decided that Jamie is going to do the Dancer scary barbie chick girl.

02:55:05.760 --> 02:55:07.760
That would be funny.

02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:10.760
You could be a cowgirl.

02:55:10.760 --> 02:55:12.760
We'll shave your head in odd ways.

02:55:12.760 --> 02:55:15.760
We're going to set your hair on fire and take a picture.

02:55:15.760 --> 02:55:17.760
No, we're not setting my hair on fire.

02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:20.760
I can wear my tourniquet with my glasses on, whatever.

02:55:20.760 --> 02:55:21.760
We'll see.

02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:22.760
Alright.

02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:23.760
That would actually be from a 2D action video.

02:55:23.760 --> 02:55:25.760
Ah, ah, beautiful, beautiful.

02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:26.760
Snubdisphonoid, got it.

02:55:26.760 --> 02:55:27.760
Stoic.

02:55:27.760 --> 02:55:28.760
We're dressing up like the stoic video.

02:55:28.760 --> 02:55:29.760
Yes, alright.

02:55:29.760 --> 02:55:30.760
Thank you.

02:55:30.760 --> 02:55:31.760
Word.

02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:32.760
Winner.

02:55:32.760 --> 02:55:33.760
Thank you guys.

02:55:33.760 --> 02:55:34.760
Alright.

02:55:34.760 --> 02:55:35.760
But don't be offended if I don't drool.

02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:36.760
Stoic it is.

02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:37.760
There you go.

02:55:37.760 --> 02:55:40.040
But we need to actually photoshop in a tran next to him.

02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:41.540
We will.

02:55:41.540 --> 02:55:44.960
And I'm going to dress up as the chick from the last message video.

02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:48.520
It's only fitting since they sit on the ground all the time.

02:55:48.520 --> 02:55:49.520
Yeah, so just sit on the ground all the time.

02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:50.520
Yeah, you're going to do stoic.

02:55:50.520 --> 02:55:51.520
Alright.

02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:52.520
And then I get to be the girl from Dancer.

02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:54.360
I'm going to bring in a Barbie.

02:55:54.360 --> 02:55:57.840
One of my goth-ed out Barbies.

02:55:57.840 --> 02:55:58.840
Right on.

02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:04.840
You know, a little known fact, I used to have a public access show when I was in high school.

02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:06.840
Actually, I think I have mentioned this on a show before.

02:56:06.840 --> 02:56:07.840
I had a public access show when I was in high school.

02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:09.840
We actually did a sketch on the show once.

02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:10.840
It was Industrial Gothic Barbie.

02:56:10.840 --> 02:56:11.840
Cool.

02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:12.840
And we had a little Barbie that we dressed up.

02:56:12.840 --> 02:56:14.840
We had Depeche Mode songs playing loud.

02:56:14.840 --> 02:56:18.840
She came with her own cage and kitty familiar.

02:56:18.840 --> 02:56:22.840
I had this weird phase I went through where I was buying Barbies because I...

02:56:22.840 --> 02:56:25.840
When I was in third grade, I let all my Barbies mold.

02:56:25.840 --> 02:56:27.840
And then I just went off and played with my Transformers.

02:56:27.840 --> 02:56:31.840
and then suddenly I realized that the Barbies that came out for a little while were actually kind of cool,

02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:33.840
except I wanted to alter them.

02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:36.840
And so I did.

02:56:36.840 --> 02:56:37.840
Into what?

02:56:37.840 --> 02:56:39.840
I would actually make their clothes.

02:56:39.840 --> 02:56:40.840
That's cool.

02:56:40.840 --> 02:56:42.840
I'm a little fashion designer. I used to want to be a fashion designer.

02:56:42.840 --> 02:56:44.840
Did you fashion design for G.I. Joe, too?

02:56:44.840 --> 02:56:45.840
No.

02:56:45.840 --> 02:56:46.840
Because he needed it.

02:56:46.840 --> 02:56:49.840
No, because you know what? They never came out with the G.I. Joe that had hair.

02:56:49.840 --> 02:56:50.840
Oh, that's true.

02:56:50.840 --> 02:56:52.840
I wanted Earring Magic Ken, though.

02:56:52.840 --> 02:56:54.840
Because Earring Magic Ken came with a cock ring.

02:56:54.840 --> 02:57:01.840
And the guy admitted that when he designed them, the pen that he wore around his neck

02:57:01.900 --> 02:57:08.020
really was a cock rake. And they took it off the market. I bet if you go to E-May and look

02:57:08.020 --> 02:57:15.020
up earring magic hen, then there are going to be bugs.

02:57:16.160 --> 02:57:20.860
Interesting. Okay. Also, we're going to get around and get everybody's final thoughts

02:57:20.860 --> 02:57:24.660
for the night. But first, I want to say we didn't even talk about this on the show tonight.

02:57:24.660 --> 02:57:28.660

One of the first shows that I watched all the time.

03:00:30.180 --> 03:00:31.180
I am crying.

03:00:31.180 --> 03:00:37.180

03:00:37.180 --> 03:00:39.180
So, kind of a serious fortune cookie tonight.
