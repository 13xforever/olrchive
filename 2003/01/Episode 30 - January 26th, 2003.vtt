00:02.416 --> 00:03.277
[SPEAKER_01]: Message for you, son!

00:03.738 --> 00:04.419
[SPEAKER_16]: Attention!

00:05.600 --> 00:09.505
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

00:11.107 --> 00:16.154
[SPEAKER_31]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, Mamani Talk, and then some.

00:19.785 --> 00:22.707
[SPEAKER_31]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

00:23.027 --> 00:26.209
[SPEAKER_31]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

00:26.790 --> 00:29.512
[SPEAKER_31]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

00:30.032 --> 00:32.934
[SPEAKER_31]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

00:33.714 --> 00:34.135
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

00:34.335 --> 00:35.936
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

00:36.136 --> 00:43.601
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode... Hey, any balls down there?

00:43.861 --> 00:46.343
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the biggest berry I've ever seen, Jingleberry.

00:46.403 --> 00:48.444
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your favorite scary movie?

00:49.577 --> 00:50.157
[SPEAKER_12]: Showgirls.

00:51.038 --> 00:52.258
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely frightful.

00:52.418 --> 00:53.239
[SPEAKER_12]: What's yours?

00:53.279 --> 00:55.740
[SPEAKER_12]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.060
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't torture yourself.

00:57.681 --> 00:58.541
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my job.

00:58.621 --> 01:00.442
[SPEAKER_27]: Now's the time our sprockets made me dogs!

01:00.502 --> 01:03.603
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll get you, my pretty.

01:03.803 --> 01:05.144
[SPEAKER_14]: And your little dog, too.

01:05.524 --> 01:06.444
[SPEAKER_12]: I know Kung Fu.

01:06.804 --> 01:09.225
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:09.466 --> 01:11.326
[SPEAKER_14]: Why did they have to take the word gang?

01:12.927 --> 01:15.528
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody expects a Spanish exposition.

01:15.848 --> 01:16.669
[SPEAKER_16]: It's gender.

01:16.729 --> 01:17.249
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey!

01:19.520 --> 01:21.321
[SPEAKER_30]: DarkSakura, Shut up!

01:21.521 --> 01:22.181
[SPEAKER_21]: Where's my gun?

01:22.321 --> 01:24.643
[SPEAKER_21]: This is my boomstick!

01:24.723 --> 01:27.244
[SPEAKER_03]: Sky, Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

01:27.564 --> 01:31.286
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

01:31.346 --> 01:34.107
[SPEAKER_16]: What kind of warped human being would find that funny?

01:34.388 --> 01:45.073
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio We are live and this is episode number 30 for January 9th, I'm sorry, January the 26th of 2003.

01:47.498 --> 01:52.243
[SPEAKER_02]: You're tuned into the Bimani Scene's most apocalyptic radio station of all things Bimani.

01:52.964 --> 01:54.786
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts, or you might know me as Sky.

01:55.647 --> 01:59.711
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

02:01.473 --> 02:03.095
[SPEAKER_02]: You know her better as DarkSakura.

02:04.056 --> 02:05.958
[SPEAKER_02]: She does not sound very enjoyed today, I'm sorry.

02:06.078 --> 02:06.638
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'm okay.

02:07.299 --> 02:08.781
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, we're having some... And you bring...

02:09.601 --> 02:11.042
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a mixing board for this damn show.

02:35.938 --> 02:42.121
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, anyway, also in the house, say hello to our tech master Loki.

02:42.842 --> 02:43.282
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey everybody.

02:44.062 --> 02:44.723
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

02:46.684 --> 02:47.344
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing good.

02:47.825 --> 02:54.509
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have special guests in the studio tonight, except they're all in the other room, so fuck them.

02:54.529 --> 02:55.569
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't exist to me.

02:56.910 --> 02:57.471
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, here they come.

02:58.231 --> 02:58.711
[SPEAKER_03]: Here I come.

02:58.971 --> 03:00.592
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he just say he sucks on the dick soar?

03:02.073 --> 03:02.974
[SPEAKER_34]: Hello dick suck soar.

03:03.692 --> 03:05.253
[SPEAKER_34]: Who are the Dick Suck Swords?

03:05.614 --> 03:07.155
[SPEAKER_03]: It would not be nice to have a sword here.

03:07.395 --> 03:09.297
[SPEAKER_34]: Introduce yourselves for the listening audience, please.

03:10.237 --> 03:12.459
[SPEAKER_05]: Why, I hear everything.

03:14.741 --> 03:16.262
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you damn slacker.

03:16.342 --> 03:19.665
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thanks, I was going to do it.

03:19.685 --> 03:22.847
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Brian, aka STMX, whatever you like.

03:31.704 --> 03:32.605
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

03:51.252 --> 03:58.341
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we're going to start right off the gate tonight with tonight's list list, and we'll be right back after this break with the list list.

03:58.541 --> 04:04.428
[SPEAKER_02]: To start off tonight, we're going to play a little song that's really popular in DDR Extreme.

04:04.488 --> 04:07.131
[SPEAKER_02]: It came over from Poppin' Music, and all you kids love it.

04:07.171 --> 04:09.274
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Daiken Kai.

04:09.874 --> 04:10.115
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

04:10.135 --> 04:10.315
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

Thank you for watching!

07:51.759 --> 08:00.349
I'm giving all my heart to you, my love I justify my love for you I'm giving you my heart, my soul, my love I justify my love for you I justify my love for you

08:37.125 --> 08:46.109
[SPEAKER_32]: And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.

08:46.529 --> 08:48.570
[SPEAKER_10]: Do it all night, do it with me.

08:49.010 --> 08:51.391
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible.

08:51.431 --> 08:52.792
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you take vocal lessons?

08:52.852 --> 08:53.832
[SPEAKER_17]: Kill your teacher.

08:54.332 --> 08:55.353
[SPEAKER_17]: In the heat of the night.

08:55.813 --> 08:58.034
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.

08:59.214 --> 08:59.895
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it.

09:00.415 --> 09:01.956
[SPEAKER_17]: Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.

09:02.056 --> 09:02.496
[SPEAKER_17]: Next.

09:04.413 --> 09:06.836
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, that was cool.

09:08.239 --> 09:10.021
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you even know why you're here?

09:10.121 --> 09:12.305
[SPEAKER_17]: That was just bloody pathetic, next!

09:17.691 --> 09:17.891
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes!

09:18.311 --> 09:18.951
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, that's it!

09:19.291 --> 09:20.492
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a winner!

09:21.252 --> 09:25.653
[SPEAKER_32]: A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

09:26.033 --> 09:29.914
[SPEAKER_02]: A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio, because I say that every week.

09:31.454 --> 09:33.015
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, yes, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

09:33.775 --> 09:35.115
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're having the humming issue tonight.

09:35.155 --> 09:35.935
[SPEAKER_02]: We apologize.

09:35.995 --> 09:37.136
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not much we can do about it.

09:37.176 --> 09:41.597
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're actually going to try to do is kind of turn down our volumes and kill our in-studio noise.

09:41.917 --> 09:43.997
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys will have to talk really loud into the mics tonight.

09:44.317 --> 09:44.978
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay!

09:45.238 --> 09:45.838
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like that.

09:45.898 --> 09:46.258
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

09:47.762 --> 09:48.462
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear us?

09:49.723 --> 09:50.764
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi!

09:51.144 --> 09:54.746
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we apologize for the humming, but my computer just sucks.

09:55.567 --> 09:56.807
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they like it when you hum.

09:58.809 --> 09:59.309
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, yes.

10:03.231 --> 10:08.875
[SPEAKER_02]: I dusted off that erotic promo because American Idol 2 premiered this week.

10:09.235 --> 10:13.377
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anybody out there gives a shit about American Idol anymore, but I watched it.

10:13.397 --> 10:14.578
[SPEAKER_21]: American Idol makes me shit.

10:17.981 --> 10:20.164
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate Irene, by the way, ladies and gentlemen.

10:33.843 --> 10:34.904
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

10:35.404 --> 10:36.184
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a virgin?

10:36.204 --> 10:37.505
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you are a virgin.

10:37.965 --> 10:41.907
[SPEAKER_03]: No one is going to touch you with a 10-foot pole.

10:41.967 --> 10:42.567
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

10:43.168 --> 10:51.071
[SPEAKER_03]: My God, it's like, let's get some cracked-out baby, raise him up to be a pop idol, and put him on the show.

10:51.151 --> 10:51.952
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, no, he's stupid.

10:54.479 --> 10:57.360
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this American Idol 2 show because I like crap.

10:57.980 --> 11:06.603
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's just, there's a lot of really, I don't know, I think I'm sick or something because I love watching Simon tear into these people who can't sing.

11:06.643 --> 11:07.023
[SPEAKER_02]: You like crap.

11:07.043 --> 11:07.323
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I can.

11:07.383 --> 11:08.864
[SPEAKER_02]: I just drink a big crap in the toilet.

11:09.244 --> 11:09.824
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

11:09.864 --> 11:10.624
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for sharing.

11:11.824 --> 11:20.347
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, Channel Pound Orange Lounge is requesting, our chat room, by the way, if you want to join our website, orangelounge.skie.cx, they're requesting a Hummer.

11:22.548 --> 11:22.928
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.

11:26.912 --> 11:28.993
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what we used to do, which is quite funny?

11:29.253 --> 11:37.358
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had this giant, giant subwoofer at Qzar, and people used to sit on it, and then we used to yell into the mic.

11:38.339 --> 11:39.439
[SPEAKER_03]: Women liked it, I don't know.

11:40.260 --> 11:42.621
[SPEAKER_03]: That was done on the Howard Stern movie.

11:43.842 --> 11:45.043
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, been there, done that high.

11:46.023 --> 11:47.824
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, oh yeah, we were looking at the rating books.

11:48.265 --> 11:48.625
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn you!

11:50.723 --> 11:51.684
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

12:17.938 --> 12:18.819
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna give it another one, so fuck it

12:33.080 --> 12:37.183
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to start off tonight's show with a listless segment, because we usually do it at the end of the show.

12:37.203 --> 12:47.352
[SPEAKER_02]: But tonight we're going to do it at the beginning of the show, because we want to talk about something that's going on right now, right this very minute, that is preventing our usual amounts of listeners from turning out in droves.

12:48.113 --> 12:49.013
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on, Jamie?

12:50.495 --> 12:53.057
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than you about ready to get whopped with this microphone.

12:53.597 --> 12:57.420
[SPEAKER_22]: The fucking stupid bull.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.541
[SPEAKER_03]: What's actually happening is...

13:01.499 --> 13:03.379
[SPEAKER_20]: They're sucking more ass than they've ever sucked in their life.

13:03.399 --> 13:09.141
[SPEAKER_03]: The raiders are bending over while... While the securers make the choosers, finally.

13:09.221 --> 13:10.341
[SPEAKER_21]: In their rectal cavity.

13:10.721 --> 13:12.141
[SPEAKER_21]: And pirate.

13:15.442 --> 13:16.382
[SPEAKER_12]: Y'all just jealous.

13:17.842 --> 13:19.783
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could lose by 30 points!

13:19.823 --> 13:20.383
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo!

13:20.723 --> 13:25.604
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry, but at this point, the collective asshole of the raiders is the cavernous.

13:26.384 --> 13:28.484
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I should go check out the score, because maybe things turned around.

13:28.644 --> 13:29.365
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny?

13:29.385 --> 13:30.485
[SPEAKER_22]: What, by two points, maybe?

13:32.565 --> 13:36.086
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if there's going to be rioting in San Diego tonight when the Raiders lose really badly.

13:36.486 --> 13:42.928
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, like, I don't know if you guys heard, but the whole town of San Diego was kind of bracing themselves for Raiders fans.

13:42.948 --> 13:45.189
[SPEAKER_02]: Because San Diego is only about an eight-hour drive from Oakland.

13:45.509 --> 13:48.870
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, a lot of those insane people that like to burn things are going to drive down there.

13:49.910 --> 13:52.751
[SPEAKER_22]: So... We're going to be hearing all kinds of... Oh, man.

13:53.231 --> 13:54.452
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to see that.

13:54.472 --> 13:55.312
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, riot goodness.

13:55.672 --> 13:58.073
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to blame it on Al-Qaeda.

13:58.893 --> 14:00.694
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not Oakland, it's not San Diego.

14:00.974 --> 14:01.774
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Al-Qaeda.

14:02.094 --> 14:03.915
[SPEAKER_03]: Al-Qaeda wanted the Raiders to win.

14:07.356 --> 14:09.176
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I still stand by my word for it.

14:09.196 --> 14:10.117
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the stupid bowl.

14:10.137 --> 14:11.877
[SPEAKER_22]: Although the commercials are pretty funny.

14:12.938 --> 14:16.619
[SPEAKER_33]: Remember, America, if the Raiders lose, the terrorists win.

14:18.940 --> 14:20.120
[SPEAKER_02]: See, this is what's going to happen.

14:20.420 --> 14:22.601
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what's going to happen when the Raiders lose the Super Bowl.

14:26.224 --> 14:37.349
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was totally unnecessary.

14:37.529 --> 14:40.490
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, oh yes, our list list, hi.

14:40.910 --> 14:43.431
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be doing a list list tonight.

14:44.492 --> 14:48.393
[SPEAKER_02]: Top three things, or top thing, because we have one thing.

14:48.673 --> 14:52.155
[SPEAKER_02]: Top things that we'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl.

15:03.701 --> 15:04.783
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want you to stop.

15:07.567 --> 15:08.468
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so tonight's list list.

15:08.808 --> 15:13.495
[SPEAKER_02]: Top three things we'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl, except two of our guests just ran out of studio, so we can't even...

15:16.159 --> 15:29.071
[SPEAKER_02]: The way a list list works, we all will read our top three choices, and then the fun part, we have to go around the room, and each person will remove one thing from that list.

15:29.872 --> 15:34.196
[SPEAKER_03]: They came up from 3 to 21 and 34, they're in the fourth quarter.

15:34.536 --> 15:35.597
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gods!

15:35.877 --> 15:36.678
[SPEAKER_03]: They still have a chance.

15:36.778 --> 15:37.198
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, whatever.

15:37.218 --> 15:38.259
[SPEAKER_02]: I know none of you care.

15:39.920 --> 15:40.180
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

15:40.960 --> 15:41.260
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

15:42.081 --> 15:42.941
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody else got lazy.

15:42.981 --> 15:43.882
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, yes, the topic.

15:44.282 --> 15:46.623
[SPEAKER_02]: Top three things we'd rather be doing than watch the Super Bowl.

15:50.225 --> 15:54.067
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, and then the chat room, you guys will get to vote on what ends up being the ultimate list.

15:54.807 --> 15:56.928
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to vote, join our chat room now.

15:57.008 --> 16:02.010
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go to our webpage at orangelounge.skie.cx and...

16:10.561 --> 16:15.527
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Brad's back there talking about... The best thing about the Super Bowl is all the cool commercials.

16:15.848 --> 16:20.314
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, since so many people are watching TV, they pay millions of dollars to put commercial spots.

16:21.187 --> 16:26.509
[SPEAKER_03]: They did, well, yeah, sometimes they air, you know, a little later, a little afterwards.

16:26.529 --> 16:30.990
[SPEAKER_03]: But, anywho, they had the Matrix commercial in there for the two new Matrix movies coming out.

16:31.730 --> 16:32.850
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty fucking cool, guys.

16:33.731 --> 16:34.131
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited.

16:34.211 --> 16:34.651
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wet.

16:34.831 --> 16:36.451
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they'll be, I'm sure they're already online.

16:36.611 --> 16:40.172
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I think somebody in our chat, I think EOSFVB already has a copy of them.

16:40.232 --> 16:43.613
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm seeing that movie at least eight times when it comes out.

16:43.953 --> 16:48.575
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's one thing about the Matrix movies, I can see them over and over and over again, and I'm still entertained every time.

16:49.515 --> 16:51.275
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Jamie with Harry Potter.

16:51.715 --> 16:52.055
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

16:52.556 --> 16:55.396
[SPEAKER_03]: Except Harry Potter doesn't do fucking martial arts and shit.

16:55.436 --> 16:56.936
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.

16:57.036 --> 16:57.396
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.

16:58.016 --> 16:58.777
[SPEAKER_22]: That would be cool.

17:00.217 --> 17:01.037
[SPEAKER_22]: Harry Potter!

17:02.257 --> 17:02.657
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, no.

17:02.697 --> 17:07.378
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you know it was on... I think it's the Smoking Gun or something.

17:09.738 --> 17:16.580
[SPEAKER_22]: They had a drug bust of a shipment of ecstasy pills from... Yes, I did see that with Harry Potter's logo.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.440
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, with the big HP on them.

17:19.827 --> 17:21.970
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyway, let's start.

17:22.050 --> 17:23.031
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's read off our list.

17:23.712 --> 17:25.314

17:40.638 --> 17:45.845
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I really don't give a shit at all, I didn't even make a list, so I'm just going to pull random shit out of my head.

17:45.945 --> 17:46.666
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, go for it.

17:46.746 --> 17:48.849

[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Ryan, the number two thing you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl.

19:38.947 --> 19:48.357

19:49.483 --> 19:51.605
[SPEAKER_22]: If you don't reserve them there, I'll kill you.

19:52.105 --> 19:54.707
[SPEAKER_22]: Because my man is just lost.

19:55.568 --> 19:56.769

[SPEAKER_22]: Quite often.

[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan, your number one thing you'd rather be doing in the Washington Bowl.

21:41.275 --> 21:41.475
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you.

21:41.535 --> 21:41.936
[SPEAKER_33]: I'll be.

21:42.416 --> 21:44.456
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm totally going to win this vote here.

21:45.017 --> 21:47.477
[SPEAKER_33]: Big Black Cock!

21:47.958 --> 21:51.539
[SPEAKER_33]: B-I-G-B-L-A-C-K-C-O-C-K, people!

21:51.759 --> 21:53.339
[SPEAKER_33]: Big Black Cock!

21:54.620 --> 21:55.260
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really gay.

21:55.280 --> 21:56.960
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd rather be doing a Big Black Cock?

21:56.980 --> 21:57.441
[SPEAKER_02]: That's gay.

22:02.833 --> 22:03.094
[SPEAKER_34]: All right.

22:04.416 --> 22:06.959
[SPEAKER_20]: He just wants it to exist instead of Super Bowl.

22:08.221 --> 22:10.785
[SPEAKER_20]: There shall be a big black cock for the masses.

22:11.726 --> 22:14.049
[SPEAKER_33]: And all shall worship it and be happy.

22:14.289 --> 22:17.294
[SPEAKER_33]: And lo, God was pleased by big black cock.

22:20.423 --> 22:23.726
[SPEAKER_02]: My number one thing that I put was masturbating.

22:24.206 --> 22:27.769
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was not actually a stress of PM to me that I should say that.

22:27.789 --> 22:29.050
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually already had it written down.

22:29.090 --> 22:29.991
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, you people know me.

22:30.411 --> 22:31.232
[SPEAKER_02]: I put masturbating.

22:31.272 --> 22:32.953
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, that's kind of already on the list.

22:32.993 --> 22:36.276
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'll say... The slave waits while the masturbates.

22:37.537 --> 22:38.998
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine was a hot spicy boner.

22:39.018 --> 22:40.339
[SPEAKER_03]: Yours could be mild.

22:40.379 --> 22:41.800
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think I'm going to change it.

22:42.160 --> 22:46.244
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say rather than the Super Bowl, I would rather get fucked up the ass.

22:46.264 --> 22:46.504
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

22:47.620 --> 22:51.983
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're infringing on the big black cock.

22:54.565 --> 22:55.946
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine's cool.

22:55.966 --> 22:58.508
[SPEAKER_02]: How about, how about, you know what?

22:58.528 --> 23:00.449
[SPEAKER_02]: Innocent.

23:17.099 --> 23:19.821
[SPEAKER_02]: How about get fucked up the ass by the entire losing team?

23:19.881 --> 23:20.501
[SPEAKER_02]: How about that?

23:21.102 --> 23:23.043
[SPEAKER_22]: Ew, no, then you'll get a disease.

23:23.964 --> 23:24.724
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're right, never mind.

23:24.744 --> 23:25.925

[SPEAKER_02]: One of these has to come off the list.

[SPEAKER_03]: As much of a fan as I am of pain.

[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, no I'm not.

25:29.757 --> 25:32.980
[SPEAKER_03]: So, wisdom teeth pulling while awake has come off the list.

[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't hurt.

[SPEAKER_03]: Ryan, something's got to come off this list.

25:50.099 --> 25:57.945
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, there's no really much other reasons to go to Scandia rather than 2DX and Xtreme, and 2DX is already on the list, so I'm going to remove Go to Scandia.

25:59.554 --> 26:00.075
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey!

26:00.335 --> 26:02.238

[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take off watching Ally McFeel.

26:06.144 --> 26:10.751
[SPEAKER_02]: As great as that porno is, we haven't even talked about it yet, so there's no way in hell it's going to get a vote anyway.

26:11.091 --> 26:12.834
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's kind of pointless.

26:13.860 --> 26:17.043
[SPEAKER_22]: Being the token female, I'm going to take off the hot spicy boner.

26:17.063 --> 26:20.007
[SPEAKER_22]: I simply don't have one to know what the experience is like.

26:20.747 --> 26:25.693
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd just like to point out that through all the guys in this room, getting fucked up the ass remained on the list.

26:27.094 --> 26:29.436
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like I said, it's not a gay thing.

26:30.137 --> 26:35.142
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just funny sounding, and we'll get votes, and we want to win because it's funny.

26:35.843 --> 26:36.303
[SPEAKER_03]: Random.

26:36.743 --> 26:36.963
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

26:37.363 --> 26:37.703
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

[SPEAKER_02]: So, these are your choices, and you can send me your votes right now in private message in the chat room, or you can send them over email to orangelaunchradio at yahoo.com, but you better do it now.

26:48.446 --> 26:53.327
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, tell us, what are the things that they can vote on that they'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl?

26:53.347 --> 26:57.828
[SPEAKER_22]: Playing 2DX, shaving a monkey, fixing Ryan's stupid fucking PS2.

[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to take a quick break, and we'll be right back to reveal your list of things you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl.

27:20.283 --> 27:22.504
[SPEAKER_02]: You should put something that is truly ass-worthy.

27:22.524 --> 27:23.564
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that is truly ass-worthy.

27:23.845 --> 27:25.645
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I might have a twin remix on here.

27:25.685 --> 27:26.526
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

27:27.307 --> 27:29.729
[SPEAKER_22]: You have to play the gayest song in all of Imani.

27:29.909 --> 27:30.489
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what's that?

27:30.969 --> 27:31.390
[SPEAKER_22]: Dynamite.

27:32.370 --> 27:32.851
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, okay.

27:33.011 --> 27:33.711
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, Dynamite Rave?

27:33.931 --> 27:34.632
[SPEAKER_22]: No, Dynamite.

27:34.832 --> 27:35.712
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Freaks.

27:35.732 --> 27:36.253
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Freaks.

27:36.273 --> 27:37.333
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, I don't even know if I have that.

27:37.774 --> 27:38.454
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I have it.

27:38.514 --> 27:41.236
[SPEAKER_22]: You should do it because I gave it to you.

27:41.756 --> 27:42.597
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what?

27:42.877 --> 27:43.317
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on here?

27:43.577 --> 27:44.658
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

27:44.798 --> 27:48.681
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll look for Dynamite, but it's probably on one of your pre-show discs, huh?

27:49.021 --> 27:50.442
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I actually gave it to you.

27:50.522 --> 27:52.243
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to find it.

27:52.283 --> 27:53.704
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I copied it to my drive.

27:53.724 --> 27:54.064
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.

27:58.487 --> 27:59.328
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week's free show.

28:01.108 --> 28:03.829
[SPEAKER_02]: Put this in and we'll find a song to play for you lovely people.

28:09.011 --> 28:12.512
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we're going to play... Big Black Cock.

28:15.513 --> 28:18.294
[SPEAKER_02]: Loading, loading, loading, loading away.

28:19.175 --> 28:20.535
[SPEAKER_02]: Did my wind amp freeze?

28:20.795 --> 28:22.236
[SPEAKER_02]: That would really suck.

28:23.016 --> 28:23.456
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it didn't.

28:23.476 --> 28:23.656
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

28:23.876 --> 28:24.096
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

28:24.657 --> 28:25.297
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what do we hear?

28:25.597 --> 28:25.657
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh...

28:29.952 --> 28:31.832
[SPEAKER_03]: Bitches is cool, but it's not crappy.

28:31.972 --> 28:33.533
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't put any crappy shit on here.

28:33.573 --> 28:35.093
[SPEAKER_02]: How about this Upside Down remix?

28:35.133 --> 28:37.214
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the Eurobeat version of Upside Down.

28:37.234 --> 28:38.754
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be pretty gay, we'll hear that.

28:39.694 --> 28:44.656
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we'll be right back to reveal the top list of things we'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl.

28:44.676 --> 28:44.936
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

Thank you for watching!

31:49.186 --> 31:50.732
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

32:18.126 --> 32:23.352
[SPEAKER_11]: We are secret lovers, hope no one discovers I see your everyday secret hideaway just around the way

32:47.461 --> 32:59.347
[SPEAKER_13]: Sneakin' with my baby, we can dance the night away The way we can, it's a fantasy, only you and me I want no one that's gone, then we run to call the numbers What we have to do, I'll see if we're unable, yeah

33:23.107 --> 33:28.911
[SPEAKER_29]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

33:35.393 --> 33:35.993
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what?

33:36.834 --> 33:40.775
[SPEAKER_22]: That end of Secret Rendezvous sounds like she's having diarrhea.

33:41.636 --> 33:43.517
[SPEAKER_22]: Or really constipated or something.

33:43.577 --> 33:47.178
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me play that one more time for you so you can hear it here.

33:51.880 --> 33:53.561
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, she's constipated.

33:54.061 --> 33:55.602
[SPEAKER_22]: She needs some X-Lax.

33:55.742 --> 33:57.463
[SPEAKER_22]: They make it chocolate coated and it's yummy.

33:59.036 --> 34:00.477
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

34:00.777 --> 34:01.137
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.

34:01.217 --> 34:01.957
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here it is.

34:02.017 --> 34:06.118
[SPEAKER_02]: The top three things is voted by you folks in the chat room.

34:06.518 --> 34:08.999
[SPEAKER_02]: Things you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl.

34:09.139 --> 34:15.782
[SPEAKER_02]: Number three winner is... No, Jacking My Hotspice Voter was taken off the list.

34:15.822 --> 34:16.442
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry.

34:16.922 --> 34:18.943
[SPEAKER_02]: Winning the lottery was your number three pick.

34:19.823 --> 34:20.503
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you win yet?

34:21.423 --> 34:22.264
[SPEAKER_02]: I won a ticket.

34:22.804 --> 34:23.224
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

34:24.238 --> 34:30.946
[SPEAKER_02]: Your number two pick for things you'd rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl is... Buying more Propel and drinking it.

34:31.006 --> 34:31.507
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

34:31.607 --> 34:33.049
[SPEAKER_02]: Buying more Propel and drinking it.

34:34.090 --> 34:34.911
[SPEAKER_22]: And an honor of Propel.

34:40.892 --> 35:06.168
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, and the number one thing y'all would rather be doing than watching the Super Bowl is Playing 2DX Playing 2DX, so there you have it I'm really disappointed that getting fucked up the ass and getting laid and all the sexual stuff was loose I'm starting to think your audience is a bunch of fucking weirdos If they think that winning the lottery is not as good as these other things

35:06.728 --> 35:08.749
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, if you win the lottery, you can buy sex.

35:08.949 --> 35:11.510
[SPEAKER_03]: Winning the lottery should be up there at the top.

35:12.110 --> 35:15.412
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but after winning the lottery, you can buy Propel and drink it, too.

35:15.432 --> 35:18.353
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy, like, vast amounts of Propel.

35:19.073 --> 35:21.274
[SPEAKER_23]: If you won the lottery, you could get all of those things.

35:22.234 --> 35:23.095
[SPEAKER_23]: And my spicy boner.

35:23.975 --> 35:25.256
[SPEAKER_22]: And you could buy a CDX machine.

35:25.696 --> 35:27.036
[SPEAKER_22]: Or lots of tokens.

35:27.457 --> 35:28.917
[SPEAKER_20]: You could probably buy Scandi.

35:29.878 --> 35:30.618
[SPEAKER_20]: There you go, buy Scandi.

35:31.377 --> 35:33.778
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't worry, Keaton, if we buy Scandia, we'll still keep your job.

35:33.838 --> 35:35.299
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can stay employed at Scandia.

35:35.379 --> 35:41.881
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, actually, what I think we should do is buy Golfland, fire all the management, and then have the Scandia... And then turn it into a strip club!

35:42.561 --> 35:43.642
[SPEAKER_22]: Yee-haw!

35:44.702 --> 35:45.322
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

35:46.423 --> 35:49.344
[SPEAKER_22]: No, we turn half of it into a strip club and the other half into a better arcade.

35:49.504 --> 35:50.704
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, where they would have Upskirt DDR.

35:50.744 --> 35:51.585
[SPEAKER_02]: And have a naked water park.

35:51.625 --> 35:52.345
[SPEAKER_02]: Upskirt DDR.

35:52.405 --> 35:53.125
[SPEAKER_02]: Upskirt DDR.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.746
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the idea of an all-nude water park.

35:55.766 --> 35:57.547
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just turn Golfland into a nudist colony.

35:59.827 --> 36:00.107
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait!

36:00.728 --> 36:07.515
[SPEAKER_03]: Nudist colony with one little thing, and it's gotta be, you know, like they have, you know, welcomes, all sorts of life, da-da-da-da-da, star.

36:08.016 --> 36:09.417
[SPEAKER_03]: No ugly people!

36:09.858 --> 36:16.405
[SPEAKER_03]: This includes you fat people, and you over 40 people, and you that apply to both of those.

36:17.306 --> 36:20.069
[SPEAKER_03]: No ugly people allowed.

36:21.210 --> 36:21.611
[SPEAKER_03]: Period.

36:22.711 --> 36:24.235
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a pre-screening for this.

36:25.178 --> 36:26.300
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to like pass the test.

36:26.421 --> 36:28.085
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and Jamie and I are the pre-screeners.

36:28.385 --> 36:29.548
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing.

36:29.588 --> 36:30.130
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

36:31.608 --> 36:33.629
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no, no, no, yes!

36:34.649 --> 36:35.790
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to have a few tests.

36:36.050 --> 36:38.030
[SPEAKER_03]: First, it's going to be a slightly small doorway.

36:38.310 --> 36:41.211
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't fit through the doorway, you're not allowed to go in there first off.

36:41.612 --> 36:46.914
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, it's going to have maybe some sort of small animal, like a monkey or something.

36:47.094 --> 36:48.934
[SPEAKER_03]: You scare the monkey, you don't come in.

36:52.215 --> 36:53.436
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no, I'll just bring Shermie.

36:56.077 --> 36:57.658
[SPEAKER_22]: If Shermie doesn't like you, leave.

36:57.859 --> 36:58.399
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

36:59.219 --> 37:04.103
[SPEAKER_22]: If she doesn't roll over and show you her belly, then you suck.

37:04.263 --> 37:06.724
[SPEAKER_02]: If she doesn't wave her genitalia at you, then there's something wrong.

37:08.726 --> 37:12.548
[SPEAKER_02]: No smelly people either, because there's some smelly people that go to Golfland to play guitar freaks.

37:13.529 --> 37:17.752
[SPEAKER_22]: One of them better be listening right now, because I'm going to tell you right now, fucking wash your ass.

37:17.772 --> 37:20.013
[SPEAKER_22]: No sweaty balls and no unwashed twat.

37:20.233 --> 37:20.974
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweaty balls.

37:21.694 --> 37:22.715
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweaty balls and unwashed twat.

37:23.726 --> 37:26.549
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Ryan, come talk to us about your unwashed twat.

37:28.031 --> 37:29.733
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have an unwashed twat, Ryan?

37:29.893 --> 37:31.415
[SPEAKER_03]: Has feminine odor and itching got you down?

37:33.237 --> 37:34.558
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you feeling not so fresh?

37:36.460 --> 37:37.421
[SPEAKER_20]: Try Vagisil.

37:37.622 --> 37:41.786
[SPEAKER_27]: Why don't you check on Vagiclean?

37:42.247 --> 37:45.150
[SPEAKER_33]: It's so hard when you just walk into a room and you're getting...

37:47.336 --> 37:48.136
[SPEAKER_18]: I hate you all.

37:52.098 --> 37:52.939
[SPEAKER_33]: I hate you all.

37:57.821 --> 38:00.222
[SPEAKER_33]: Meatballs and douche, yes, meatballs and douche.

38:00.883 --> 38:01.743
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, wait a minute.

38:02.143 --> 38:03.164
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, hold on, hold on.

38:03.424 --> 38:04.425
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold up for a minute here.

38:05.045 --> 38:10.928
[SPEAKER_02]: Mabel's in the chat room and he's crying because he's claiming that he's fat and ugly and if he was over 40 he wouldn't be able to get in.

38:11.792 --> 38:13.012
[SPEAKER_02]: You were neither.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.013
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're not fat or ugly.

38:15.053 --> 38:16.314
[SPEAKER_02]: You can come to our nudist colony.

38:16.334 --> 38:17.714
[SPEAKER_02]: So quit whining.

38:19.735 --> 38:21.456
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, there's a second rule to this.

38:21.536 --> 38:23.096
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called the pimp factor, okay?

38:23.336 --> 38:29.019
[SPEAKER_03]: You can look like whatever you want, but as long as you bring at least fine, really fine honeys in, you're okay.

38:29.519 --> 38:29.879
[SPEAKER_22]: Bring me...

38:30.683 --> 38:36.586
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to have a room, though, with, like, really, really pretty men going at it so I can watch them.

38:37.366 --> 38:37.886
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute, though.

38:37.926 --> 38:38.326
[SPEAKER_02]: No one under 18.

38:38.967 --> 38:39.207
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

38:39.807 --> 38:40.227
[SPEAKER_22]: No one under 18.

38:40.868 --> 38:41.348
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry.

38:41.388 --> 38:42.028
[SPEAKER_02]: We just can't have that.

38:42.208 --> 38:42.708
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, guys.

38:42.748 --> 38:43.809
[SPEAKER_22]: But I need the happy room.

38:44.889 --> 38:48.751
[SPEAKER_02]: We do like all our under 18 fans, you know, because we know we have a lot of under 18 people listening.

38:48.931 --> 38:49.591
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't get in trouble.

38:49.631 --> 38:50.512
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, guys.

38:50.812 --> 38:51.792
[SPEAKER_22]: I want the happy room, though.

38:52.272 --> 38:53.393
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to have the happy room.

38:53.533 --> 38:54.954
[SPEAKER_03]: They just have to sell it.

38:55.014 --> 38:56.175
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I can videotape it and sell it.

38:56.655 --> 38:59.358
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be like, you know, it could be like Beavis and Butthead.

38:59.658 --> 39:02.420
[SPEAKER_03]: You must be over 18 to be able to shoot skeet.

39:02.780 --> 39:03.501
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you guys over 18?

39:03.641 --> 39:05.763
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, no.

39:06.623 --> 39:07.664
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you guys over 18?

39:08.945 --> 39:09.205
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

39:09.465 --> 39:11.767
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you can just, see, there you go.

39:11.967 --> 39:13.208
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay, that'll work.

39:13.248 --> 39:13.649
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll work.

39:13.789 --> 39:14.189
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

39:15.530 --> 39:17.471
[SPEAKER_02]: If you say you're under 18, you can't get in.

39:17.491 --> 39:21.954
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you say you're over 18, then, you know, hey, we were only going off what you said, so.

39:22.935 --> 39:23.936
[SPEAKER_22]: I want the happy room.

39:26.617 --> 39:28.879
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, we could actually just turn it into a porn studio.

39:30.440 --> 39:32.801
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we would, like, pay for everything that way.

39:33.242 --> 39:35.323
[SPEAKER_22]: Because porn's really cheap to make.

39:35.663 --> 39:39.566
[SPEAKER_22]: All you need is a video camera and, like, one of those handheld spotlights.

39:41.089 --> 39:42.029
[SPEAKER_22]: You don't even need a script.

39:42.490 --> 39:45.451
[SPEAKER_22]: Say, hey you, fuck, and then make something up.

39:46.632 --> 39:50.053
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of pornography, thank you for that lovely transition.

39:50.333 --> 39:51.134
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your week?

39:52.214 --> 39:52.855
[SPEAKER_22]: Pornerific.

39:53.195 --> 39:53.895
[SPEAKER_02]: Pornerific.

39:54.275 --> 39:55.116
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your week looking?

39:57.165 --> 39:57.745
[SPEAKER_02]: and many more.

40:18.699 --> 40:37.425
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no, I was trying to, uh, yet again trying to crack the, uh, DDR Extreme disc, and, uh, so, in which case, I was, um, you know, I thought for some reason, actually, I figured out where everything is on the disc, and, um, what the fuck is so funny?

40:39.386 --> 40:41.487
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not you, sorry, I just showed Jamie something I typed.

40:41.507 --> 40:42.647
[SPEAKER_03]: Who is touching Jamie in there?

40:44.008 --> 40:44.548
[SPEAKER_22]: Stop it!

40:45.508 --> 40:47.309
[SPEAKER_22]: I was having a laugh at somebody's expense.

40:49.525 --> 40:50.586
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, we'll tell you guys during the video.

40:50.606 --> 40:51.287
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, okay.

40:51.968 --> 40:55.492
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, I was... This is very distracting, you guys.

40:56.293 --> 40:56.854
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

40:58.696 --> 41:01.359
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I was trying to install Linux on my computer.

41:02.020 --> 41:07.326
[SPEAKER_03]: I borrowed a couple copies of Linux from our friend Keith, and I was installing them on my computer.

41:07.406 --> 41:07.626
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

41:08.547 --> 41:11.050
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the damn thing didn't want to install for some reason.

41:11.070 --> 41:25.808
[SPEAKER_03]: The installation program thought it knew how to partition my drives better than I did, and so it was a pain in the ass for about three days, and then finally I went out, bought Linux, installed it, everything's fine, but now I can't do what I wanted it to do in the first place, which was...

41:27.450 --> 41:29.453
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got, okay, basically here's the situation.

41:29.573 --> 41:33.459
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got on the arcade disc for DDR Extreme, there's a bunch of files on there.

41:33.519 --> 41:37.404
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, they're images of actual, um, of the flashcards that it flashes.

41:37.424 --> 41:42.431
[SPEAKER_03]: So it basically copies this image to the flashcard, but in the images themselves are actually file trees.

41:42.791 --> 41:43.431
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

42:04.574 --> 42:05.475
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was my week.

42:06.355 --> 42:06.916
[SPEAKER_03]: Exciting.

42:07.536 --> 42:08.196
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not.

42:09.397 --> 42:10.018
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right, it's not.

42:10.378 --> 42:12.559
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I'm just kidding.

42:12.679 --> 42:13.620
[SPEAKER_02]: My week was pretty good.

42:15.181 --> 42:18.103
[SPEAKER_02]: I napped a lot, and I went out and did stuff.

42:18.283 --> 42:18.983
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, stuff.

42:19.964 --> 42:20.925
[SPEAKER_02]: I volunteered to be a prop.

42:46.513 --> 42:47.614
[SPEAKER_22]: I volunteered to be a prop.

42:47.934 --> 42:49.314
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and Jamie's on the cast too.

42:49.394 --> 42:55.197
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were here participating in the Rocky Horror rehearsal last night.

42:55.357 --> 42:58.938
[SPEAKER_02]: And somebody brought to cast rehearsal for Irene some pornography.

42:59.298 --> 43:00.839
[SPEAKER_02]: Some fine pornography.

43:01.439 --> 43:03.340
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was this porno called Ally McFeel.

43:07.102 --> 43:09.783
[SPEAKER_02]: And Irene was a dumb bitch, of course, and left it here.

43:09.803 --> 43:11.403
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

43:11.483 --> 43:12.344
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey.

43:13.724 --> 43:14.965
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a woman like that.

43:16.605 --> 43:38.247
[SPEAKER_02]: and uh so and uh so what happened last night we were bored and we went out to dinner we went out to lions and after we came back from lions jamie and i were bored so we decided we'd watch this porno holly mcfeel and it's great it's fucking great and we wanted to play a clip from it for you guys because basically the way it is it's set up

43:38.787 --> 43:39.268
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

43:54.484 --> 44:00.848
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, just like on the real show, Ally McBeal, when they go to the law firm, all the lawyers and everybody, they're all fucking each other, basically.

44:01.569 --> 44:04.330
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, then we have the big trial.

44:04.370 --> 44:05.531
[SPEAKER_02]: The big trial comes later.

44:05.911 --> 44:09.113
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted to play a clip from the trial for you guys.

44:09.133 --> 44:14.497
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have Johnny Cockring, who is... I have to giggle.

44:15.057 --> 44:16.338
[SPEAKER_22]: She gave him her panties and...

44:17.003 --> 44:20.447
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we have Johnny Cockering, and Ally McFeel gave Johnny Cockering her panties.

44:20.567 --> 44:22.009
[SPEAKER_22]: He sniffed them and put them in his jacket.

44:22.029 --> 44:23.611
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and he sniffed them and put them in his jacket.

44:23.931 --> 44:28.257
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's basically the lawyer supporting the woman who had the dildo explode inside of her.

44:29.478 --> 44:34.765
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and Ally McFeel, her client is the company that made the exploding dildo.

44:35.205 --> 44:36.666
[SPEAKER_22]: Who, by the way, fucks the other person.

44:37.346 --> 44:40.088
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, who, by the way, fucks the chick with the cavernous pussy in the beginning.

44:40.108 --> 44:41.449
[SPEAKER_02]: To see if she knows how to use the dildo.

44:41.469 --> 44:43.430
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, to see if she really knows how to use the dildo.

44:43.570 --> 44:45.511
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, kind of an instruction manual.

44:45.751 --> 44:51.355
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyway, we're going to play a clip from this fabulous porno, which, by the way, also guest stars Ron Jeremy.

44:52.115 --> 44:52.635
[SPEAKER_02]: That was cool.

44:52.655 --> 44:53.116
[SPEAKER_02]: That was humongous.

44:53.136 --> 44:55.957
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've never seen a real porno with Ron Jeremy in it.

44:56.738 --> 45:00.240
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry, but that was, like, it was big.

45:02.901 --> 45:04.242
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's why he's popular.

45:04.623 --> 45:06.464
[SPEAKER_03]: He's ugly as hell, but he's got a fucking cute face.

45:06.924 --> 45:11.207
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god, he's repulsive in every way, but except his big, velvet chalk.

45:12.468 --> 45:17.012
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we're going to play a clip right now from the big trial for you guys.

45:17.052 --> 45:17.452
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

45:17.472 --> 45:19.313
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, by the way, nudist colony people?

45:20.274 --> 45:20.654
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry.

45:20.935 --> 45:21.475
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go ahead.

45:21.835 --> 45:26.539
[SPEAKER_22]: For all the nudist colony wannabes, by the way, if you're butt ugly, it's okay if you have a big dick.

45:26.559 --> 45:26.919
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

45:29.568 --> 45:31.888
[SPEAKER_02]: That is big.

45:31.908 --> 45:32.629
[SPEAKER_22]: 12 inches or more.

45:33.209 --> 45:34.569
[SPEAKER_22]: Holy shit, I'm in.

45:34.989 --> 45:35.129
[SPEAKER_02]: Ow.

45:35.189 --> 45:38.390
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, but you have to wear a mask and shave your body hair.

45:38.730 --> 45:39.210
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

45:39.770 --> 45:40.110
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

45:40.170 --> 45:43.731
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a clip from Ally McFeel here on Orange Lounge Radio.

45:43.751 --> 45:49.632
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you like Ally McFeel, since I don't want to get sued by the people who made this, go out and buy it right now.

45:50.292 --> 45:51.692
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a wonderful porno.

45:51.732 --> 45:52.612
[SPEAKER_02]: Two thumbs up.

45:52.692 --> 45:53.072
[SPEAKER_02]: Way up.

45:53.892 --> 45:54.773
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, here we go.

45:54.793 --> 45:55.993
[SPEAKER_22]: Remember, the audience is horny.

46:02.518 --> 46:03.438
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's not coming through.

46:03.498 --> 46:04.379
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, just one moment.

46:04.499 --> 46:05.579
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an issue.

46:06.599 --> 46:07.539
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on one second.

46:08.760 --> 46:11.060
[SPEAKER_02]: I have, I put it in the wrong hole, sorry.

46:14.902 --> 46:15.802
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try this again.

46:18.503 --> 46:23.184
[SPEAKER_24]: This offending instrument was manufactured by Mr. Boner's company.

46:24.199 --> 46:25.000
[SPEAKER_28]: Objection!

46:25.560 --> 46:27.541
[SPEAKER_28]: My client's name is Bone Herb.

46:28.122 --> 46:32.425
[SPEAKER_28]: As in Christ, I'd like to bone her tight little asshole with my big black cock.

46:32.445 --> 46:34.666
[SPEAKER_24]: Miss MacPhil, you're walking a tight line here.

46:36.948 --> 46:40.490
[SPEAKER_24]: Counsel will not refer to defendant as boner.

46:41.631 --> 46:47.295
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Bone Herb's company negligently manufactured this defective dildo.

46:47.555 --> 46:49.877
[SPEAKER_24]: It will apparently damage my client's genitalia.

46:50.337 --> 46:51.978
[SPEAKER_24]: Emotional and physical harm has set in.

46:52.658 --> 46:53.039
[SPEAKER_24]: Chicken...

46:54.580 --> 46:57.321
[SPEAKER_24]: Chocus Pocus is next.

46:58.761 --> 47:01.221
[SPEAKER_24]: Just I ask you, do the right thing.

47:01.701 --> 47:04.782
[SPEAKER_24]: If the dildos is not fit, then they are not legit.

47:07.443 --> 47:08.903
[SPEAKER_19]: Big black cock.

47:09.183 --> 47:14.644
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just really excited and Jamie and I started wetting our pants when she said big black cock.

47:17.305 --> 47:23.826
[SPEAKER_21]: The little gears started turning in Rob's head as he thought, how am I going to... If the dildos is not fit, they are not legit.

47:25.233 --> 47:26.514
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that bullshit?

47:27.995 --> 47:29.716
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Maple missed it, so we have to play it again.

47:29.776 --> 47:30.236
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, guys.

47:30.296 --> 47:30.716
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

47:30.836 --> 47:32.477
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, one more time.

47:32.757 --> 47:33.378
[SPEAKER_02]: Instant replay.

47:34.378 --> 47:35.799
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, sorry.

47:35.839 --> 47:36.780
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get back here.

47:37.280 --> 47:40.322
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be part of a new promo.

47:40.382 --> 47:40.862
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here we go.

47:40.882 --> 47:41.382
[SPEAKER_24]: Here we go.

47:41.402 --> 47:41.562
[SPEAKER_24]: Miss...

47:57.203 --> 47:58.083
[SPEAKER_22]: Big black cock.

47:58.283 --> 47:59.564
[SPEAKER_22]: And you know the judge looks like The Rock.

48:00.084 --> 48:02.284
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the judge looks just like The Rock.

48:02.304 --> 48:03.484
[SPEAKER_22]: With like little twisty spikes.

48:04.305 --> 48:06.265
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he said it was like a nerdy version of The Rock.

48:06.285 --> 48:06.805
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, he was hot.

48:07.405 --> 48:12.206
[SPEAKER_22]: This is actually one of the few straight porns that actually had good looking guys in it.

48:12.766 --> 48:15.027
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it actually had attractive males in this porn.

48:15.047 --> 48:15.687
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for Ron Jeremy.

48:15.707 --> 48:16.487
[SPEAKER_02]: That was psycho.

48:16.507 --> 48:17.407
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, except for Ron Jeremy.

48:17.427 --> 48:19.188
[SPEAKER_02]: But he has a big dick, so it's okay.

48:19.228 --> 48:20.928
[SPEAKER_20]: Big dick, you know, made up for it all.

48:24.292 --> 48:25.333
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, dear good lord.

48:56.097 --> 48:58.239
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

48:58.279 --> 48:59.561
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that scene was funny, though.

48:59.581 --> 49:02.064
[SPEAKER_03]: The one chick gets her teeth knocked out and he's all, ooh, a gummer.

49:02.364 --> 49:06.428
[SPEAKER_03]: And then later on she gets her teeth back again, like, ooh, what happened there?

49:07.109 --> 49:10.833
[SPEAKER_02]: This porno gets Orange Lounge's highest recommendation, by the way.

49:10.873 --> 49:11.654
[SPEAKER_02]: Two dicks up, way up.

49:11.674 --> 49:12.295
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see that other

49:13.579 --> 49:16.060
[SPEAKER_02]: Upskirt Cam Pantsless Cam Crossdress or Upskirt Cam Military Kilt Cam

49:40.157 --> 49:44.741
[SPEAKER_22]: There's nothing as enjoyable as kilts worn the traditional way on a breezy day.

49:46.743 --> 49:47.383
[SPEAKER_34]: You're a pervert.

49:48.364 --> 49:51.707
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's really gotten me wondering about a lot of my townsfolk.

49:51.767 --> 49:53.409
[SPEAKER_03]: I got, you know, Bob the Cat.

49:53.789 --> 49:55.650
[SPEAKER_03]: He's wearing like a skirt throughout my town.

49:55.690 --> 49:57.512
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what the fuck's going on, Bob?

49:57.832 --> 49:58.913
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob, you're a guy.

49:58.953 --> 50:01.816
[SPEAKER_03]: You're supposed to be wearing guy clothes, not a skirt.

50:02.955 --> 50:08.677
[SPEAKER_22]: There's this rhino in our town named Spike who has a band-aid on his face and he's all hardcore.

50:08.897 --> 50:09.977
[SPEAKER_22]: He was wearing this skull shirt.

50:10.477 --> 50:16.339
[SPEAKER_22]: And then one day he started wearing a blue muumuu with daisies on it.

50:16.359 --> 50:18.079
[SPEAKER_02]: Your town makes people gay, remember?

50:18.339 --> 50:22.780
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, my town makes animals individual gay.

50:23.061 --> 50:24.421
[SPEAKER_22]: My town is da gay.

50:25.401 --> 50:31.023
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, you know there's the triangle with Dina and Goldie and then Goldie left her for Barbara.

50:31.363 --> 50:31.703
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my.

50:32.677 --> 50:40.280
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, no, because we thought that Goldie was getting the twat action from Dina, you know, because Dina has that big long bill.

50:41.421 --> 50:48.304
[SPEAKER_22]: And then, because she was saying sugar bill, like Dina says, and then all of a sudden she started saying, I suck, like Barbara says, because we hate Barbara, and she says, I suck.

50:48.564 --> 50:49.805
[SPEAKER_22]: Scan list, scan list.

50:49.865 --> 50:54.547
[SPEAKER_22]: I think I'm just going to change what Horned Thief, I tell, says, though, to my master again.

50:55.194 --> 50:58.516
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one in my town, Cody, he says you ass after everything.

50:58.536 --> 50:59.717
[SPEAKER_02]: So he goes, what's going on you ass?

50:59.797 --> 51:03.940
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got my, I've got, what was it, Ricky the squirrel or whatever.

51:03.960 --> 51:06.101
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that little asshole that moved from my village.

51:06.121 --> 51:09.723
[SPEAKER_03]: I changed his thing to say skanky ho after everything he says.

51:11.304 --> 51:12.185
[SPEAKER_03]: My girlfriend loves it.

51:13.225 --> 51:14.126
[SPEAKER_03]: Does she enjoy my letter?

51:15.087 --> 51:17.308
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, why do you send me stuff?

51:18.629 --> 51:20.010
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some... Was she freaked out?

51:20.150 --> 51:22.711
[SPEAKER_03]: All the townsfolk don't understand anything I write them.

51:23.132 --> 51:23.372
[SPEAKER_03]: And like...

51:23.905 --> 51:26.746
[SPEAKER_02]: The way, okay, I'm going to give you a big tip on Animal Crossing, everybody.

51:26.766 --> 51:28.187
[SPEAKER_22]: This is one of my letters.

51:28.287 --> 51:32.589
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to get things from the villagers, write a full letter.

51:32.629 --> 51:35.290
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to write like six lines of letter to your villagers.

51:35.330 --> 51:36.631
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it in a way.

51:36.651 --> 51:37.111
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it works.

51:37.231 --> 51:37.631
[SPEAKER_02]: All the time.

51:37.711 --> 51:40.472
[SPEAKER_22]: All I do is, Dear so-and-so, you suck.

51:40.553 --> 51:42.093
[SPEAKER_22]: I want you to die and go to hell.

51:42.613 --> 51:45.215
[SPEAKER_22]: I hate your guts and I wish that you never moved to my village.

51:45.555 --> 51:46.215
[SPEAKER_22]: Love, Sakura.

51:46.735 --> 51:47.616
[SPEAKER_22]: And I get stuff from them.

51:48.516 --> 51:51.679
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I wrote one to Cody that said, All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.

51:51.759 --> 51:53.220
[SPEAKER_02]: All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.

51:53.300 --> 51:54.741
[SPEAKER_02]: All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.

51:54.761 --> 51:56.122
[SPEAKER_02]: All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.

51:56.462 --> 51:57.243
[SPEAKER_02]: And he sent me furniture.

51:58.844 --> 52:00.145
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

52:00.285 --> 52:01.526
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a letter from Goose today.

52:01.566 --> 52:04.829
[SPEAKER_18]: She's like, I was outside shaking trees, and a furniture fell on my head.

52:04.849 --> 52:06.030
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was it.

52:06.130 --> 52:07.491
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, why are you sending me shit?

52:08.632 --> 52:10.794
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even want to talk to you, dumb bitch.

52:11.294 --> 52:12.335
[SPEAKER_03]: I like when they're giving you tips.

52:12.515 --> 52:13.756
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know how to catch fish yet?

52:14.256 --> 52:16.178
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I just gave you a fish, you jackass.

52:16.218 --> 52:17.439
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you think I got it from?

52:18.834 --> 52:20.855
[SPEAKER_22]: We want to be slapped in the head by a wet trout.

52:20.915 --> 52:22.456
[SPEAKER_22]: By the way, we can just slap somebody in the chatroom.

52:22.476 --> 52:24.357
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to slap people in the chatroom with wet trouts?

52:24.437 --> 52:25.198
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, go for it.

52:25.318 --> 52:26.518
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you've got to click on their name first.

52:27.059 --> 52:28.019
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you slap them.

52:28.099 --> 52:28.620
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

52:28.640 --> 52:29.940
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

52:30.040 --> 52:32.222
[SPEAKER_02]: You just slapped 23rd Magus with a large trout.

52:32.682 --> 52:33.142
[SPEAKER_02]: How was that?

52:33.162 --> 52:33.783
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to slap somebody else.

52:33.803 --> 52:34.263
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you enjoy that?

52:34.283 --> 52:35.344
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to slap somebody else?

52:37.445 --> 52:38.065
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright!

52:41.667 --> 52:42.888
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you slapping myself?

52:46.059 --> 52:48.882
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Jamie's having fun slapping people with trouts.

52:52.667 --> 52:53.327
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, hold on.

52:53.768 --> 52:54.228
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan, yes.

52:54.268 --> 52:55.209
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, Ryan pointed out something.

52:55.270 --> 52:58.233
[SPEAKER_22]: It says in God we trust in the thing, but it should say in God we thrust.

52:59.534 --> 53:00.135
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, you know what?

53:00.155 --> 53:01.657
[SPEAKER_22]: There's scenes in here that never happened.

53:03.467 --> 53:04.608
[SPEAKER_22]: These are just like promo pictures.

53:29.016 --> 53:30.901
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

53:31.362 --> 53:32.245
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

53:32.606 --> 53:35.674
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jamie's having fun slapping people in the chat room with, uh, trouts.

53:40.537 --> 53:43.078
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I saw something funny on Saturday.

53:43.739 --> 53:51.824
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I was outside after playing a vigorous game of DDR Extreme, and I was tired, you know, airing out my shoes and whatnot, and I'm watching the batting cages.

53:52.445 --> 54:02.752
[SPEAKER_03]: And stupid kid number one, and I love it when stupid people get punished, stupid kid number one decides, I'm going to go bat in the batting cage, and his father's watching him and stuff.

54:03.152 --> 54:06.615
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, stupid fat chubby kid number one decides to try to hit the ball.

54:06.935 --> 54:09.917
[SPEAKER_03]: Misses the ball, and so it hits the back whole thing there.

54:10.237 --> 54:13.399
[SPEAKER_03]: So stupid kid number one goes, I'm going to pick up the ball and hit it!

54:13.800 --> 54:16.702
[SPEAKER_03]: So he picks up the ball, stands back up, thwap!

54:16.742 --> 54:19.143
[SPEAKER_03]: In the back of his head with a 50 mile an hour softball.

54:19.364 --> 54:20.905
[SPEAKER_03]: And the stupid kid falls in ground.

54:21.445 --> 54:24.387
[SPEAKER_03]: Started busting up.

54:25.028 --> 54:27.629
[SPEAKER_18]: You didn't look at the pictures on this board.

54:27.649 --> 54:28.970
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to see the pictures.

54:30.535 --> 54:33.758
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, uh, he looks like he's having fun.

54:35.159 --> 54:37.922
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, she's looking like she's having some fun.

54:38.422 --> 54:39.783
[SPEAKER_03]: She's sucking cock.

54:41.305 --> 54:45.328
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, getting done, sucking more cock.

54:46.249 --> 54:46.589
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

54:48.171 --> 54:49.051
[SPEAKER_02]: Ally McFeel.

54:49.171 --> 54:51.494
[SPEAKER_02]: We've started an outbreak of slapping in the chatroom.

54:51.514 --> 54:53.896
[SPEAKER_34]: Ah, it's all purple.

54:55.297 --> 54:56.358
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, back to Bimani.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

55:29.918 --> 55:30.278
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's see.

55:30.298 --> 55:35.739
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're going to be playing on the break here is going to be two remix songs from Club Mix, actually.

55:35.759 --> 55:40.881
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got Jam Jam Reggae, and we also have... Ska Go Go, right?

55:40.901 --> 55:41.841
[SPEAKER_03]: Ska Go Go, yes.

55:42.201 --> 55:48.463
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are both... The first one is Jam Jam Reggae, the Jam Jam remix by Good Cool.

55:48.863 --> 55:51.364
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second one is actually remixed by the same group.

55:52.644 --> 55:55.585
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it's actually arranged by Ken Matsu... I don't know.

55:56.565 --> 55:56.865
[SPEAKER_03]: Matsumoto

57:33.921 --> 57:34.969
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's rock tomorrow.

58:09.429 --> 58:17.886
[SPEAKER_10]: And will you ever be the best of friends You shout something you don't win You shout something you don't win

58:56.014 --> 58:57.915
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on baby Let's dream a dream together A dream

01:00:37.261 --> 01:00:42.403
[SPEAKER_19]: Listen to Orange Dogs Radio, where you can witness Rob being fucked up the ass by Brad.

01:00:42.783 --> 01:00:44.064
[SPEAKER_33]: Brad did a good job.

01:00:44.284 --> 01:00:48.545
[SPEAKER_33]: All that Rob's asshole is quite large by now, like a mason jar.

01:00:49.566 --> 01:00:54.167
[SPEAKER_33]: You could hold strawberry preserves in Rob's rectum now, and have it tightly sealed.

01:00:56.828 --> 01:00:57.388
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:00:58.409 --> 01:00:59.669
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, baby, I have the hugest...

01:01:05.632 --> 01:01:08.015
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it's not my fault all the boys and girls love me.

01:01:08.215 --> 01:01:08.835
[SPEAKER_18]: Does Irene know?

01:01:12.239 --> 01:01:13.780
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Irene was sitting on my lap.

01:01:15.843 --> 01:01:16.063
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

01:01:17.725 --> 01:01:19.466
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, shall we do the FUs of the week now?

01:01:20.327 --> 01:01:22.069
[SPEAKER_22]: Would that be like an extension cord?

01:01:24.552 --> 01:01:25.392
[SPEAKER_02]: Blink, blink, blink.

01:01:26.373 --> 01:01:26.654
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

01:01:28.725 --> 01:01:32.486
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have an FU of the week, you can send those over a private message or email.

01:01:32.766 --> 01:01:33.726
[SPEAKER_22]: I want TerraMix today.

01:01:34.346 --> 01:01:35.246
[SPEAKER_02]: You want TerraMix today?

01:01:35.266 --> 01:01:35.767
[SPEAKER_22]: TerraMix.

01:01:35.907 --> 01:01:37.187
[SPEAKER_22]: Picky, picky, picky.

01:01:38.167 --> 01:01:39.707
[SPEAKER_22]: Picky, picky, picky.

01:01:40.808 --> 01:01:41.188
[SPEAKER_02]: Gross.

01:01:42.128 --> 01:01:42.948
[SPEAKER_22]: That was a chocolate burp.

01:01:43.068 --> 01:01:44.128
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's have at it.

01:01:44.148 --> 01:01:47.649
[SPEAKER_22]: This burp was brought to you by Russell Stover Chocolate Truffles.

01:01:48.669 --> 01:01:49.029
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.

01:01:49.449 --> 01:01:50.830
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, you look like you're trying to deep throat me.

01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:51.470
[SPEAKER_22]: This is fucked up.

01:01:58.812 --> 01:02:01.453
[SPEAKER_18]: So a sound clip for a future episode.

01:02:29.758 --> 01:02:31.338
[SPEAKER_23]: Gentlemen, DarkSakura has a dick.

01:02:32.119 --> 01:02:33.319
[SPEAKER_20]: I do not.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.360
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the next intro right there.

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:39.561
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a dick.

01:02:39.821 --> 01:02:41.701
[SPEAKER_19]: The next fuck you goes to Rob.

01:02:42.121 --> 01:02:42.762
[SPEAKER_19]: And Brad.

01:02:43.062 --> 01:02:43.602
[SPEAKER_19]: And Dan.

01:02:43.782 --> 01:02:44.082
[SPEAKER_19]: And Dan.

01:02:44.102 --> 01:02:44.782
[SPEAKER_19]: This is KTMI.

01:02:44.882 --> 01:02:45.622
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'm sorry.

01:02:57.210 --> 01:03:04.637
[SPEAKER_22]: And my other fuck you to me goes toward America for being stupid.

01:03:05.318 --> 01:03:10.483
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, what about American football has to do with using your feet but taking the ball?

01:03:10.503 --> 01:03:14.507
[SPEAKER_22]: It happens like for what, one occurrence in the whole game?

01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:18.711
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole having to run around and everything might have to do with being stupid.

01:03:19.766 --> 01:03:20.827
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't kick the ball.

01:03:21.088 --> 01:03:26.557
[SPEAKER_20]: That's why soccer should be football like it is everywhere else in the goddamn world.

01:03:26.897 --> 01:03:28.019
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not called kickball.

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:36.298
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the thing, here's the thing though, I want to say.

01:03:36.338 --> 01:03:39.341
[SPEAKER_23]: The thing is that America doesn't give a shit about soccer.

01:03:39.841 --> 01:03:45.805
[SPEAKER_06]: Soccer is not important in America.

01:03:46.026 --> 01:03:51.950
[SPEAKER_22]: And by the way, American football is a rip-off of rugby, which is a much cooler, violent, bloodier sport.

01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:53.191
[SPEAKER_22]: Because you know what?

01:03:53.571 --> 01:03:56.313
[SPEAKER_22]: There's something about, okay, first of all, there's the guys that play it.

01:03:56.934 --> 01:04:01.938
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of them are really nicely built, and I don't look like they've been swallowing steroids since they were two years old.

01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:08.153
[SPEAKER_22]: They don't have necks with the circumference of a watermelon, okay?

01:04:09.154 --> 01:04:13.856
[SPEAKER_20]: They look like normal guys, and they're muscular, and they have this nice butt.

01:04:14.617 --> 01:04:16.358
[SPEAKER_22]: And then they get all bloody, which is even better.

01:04:17.418 --> 01:04:18.439
[SPEAKER_23]: Because Jimmy's got a dick.

01:04:26.884 --> 01:04:31.927
[SPEAKER_02]: Mabel would like to add that soccer is only cool if you're playing Virtua Striker at MGL with another friend.

01:04:32.695 --> 01:04:33.515
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, no.

01:04:35.016 --> 01:04:37.577
[SPEAKER_20]: Although, and you know, it was really awesome.

01:04:37.757 --> 01:04:39.757
[SPEAKER_21]: They even made it into one.

01:04:39.857 --> 01:04:46.499
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think there was a lot of times where they had to thank me and thank him all the time and Aristotle got to come in and work.

01:04:46.559 --> 01:04:48.040
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, who needs to get fucked?

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:48.380
I'm sorry.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.840
What else is there to think about?

01:04:49.921 --> 01:04:53.422
[SPEAKER_21]: Not necessarily who needs to get fucked, but what needs to get fucked here.

01:04:53.482 --> 01:04:53.522
Um...

01:05:01.491 --> 01:05:13.480
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah, um, fuck me not having a way to get to Hayward next weekend, because Dan doesn't want me to drive my car to Hayward because I just got it.

01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:21.906
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I would also like to say that my CD player is working, so I would charge my CD for the week, you know.

01:05:21.926 --> 01:05:24.007
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, what was the one that I was talking about?

01:05:24.027 --> 01:05:24.127
No.

01:05:24.187 --> 01:05:24.508
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, Walthland?

01:05:31.008 --> 01:05:32.650
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I don't go there anymore.

01:05:34.591 --> 01:05:35.612
[SPEAKER_22]: If your brain could.

01:05:35.993 --> 01:05:39.796
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the first question.

01:05:39.896 --> 01:05:46.702
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I would like to say thank you to my lack of man sex.

01:05:47.003 --> 01:05:47.343
[SPEAKER_34]: Brain.

01:05:48.824 --> 01:05:49.845
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't have any man sex.

01:05:50.025 --> 01:05:53.969
[SPEAKER_02]: You were asking for my brain earlier.

01:05:54.189 --> 01:05:55.090
[SPEAKER_22]: And I need more doujinshi.

01:05:56.610 --> 01:05:58.691
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, Matt, give us your Abuse of the Week.

01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:14.171
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, let's see, the first FU goes to Linux!

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:17.311
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you Linux, you stupid installer!

01:06:17.912 --> 01:06:21.572
[SPEAKER_03]: Work right for once, goddammit, you're free, you should be working!

01:06:22.392 --> 01:06:35.175
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see here, I installed three versions of Linux this weekend, 7.1 decided, gee, I don't feel like I'm gonna install at all, because I'm gonna tell you that your blank 20 gig hard drive has not enough space for me to install my stupid program.

01:06:36.275 --> 01:06:42.960
[SPEAKER_03]: So, then I tried installing Red Hat 7.0, got that working, and it's a Japanese copy!

01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:45.181
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't read Japanese, so that's not going to do me any good.

01:06:45.761 --> 01:06:51.185
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, finally, I installed Mandrake 6.4, and, well, you know what?

01:06:51.225 --> 01:06:53.186
[SPEAKER_03]: That program's so old, it doesn't run Jack.

01:06:53.307 --> 01:06:59.591
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't understand what my monitor is, it doesn't even know what my video card is, so that didn't do me any good, like installing Windows 3.0.

01:07:06.516 --> 01:07:09.419
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid bootloader that puts in there instead of the Windows bootloader.

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:14.265
[SPEAKER_03]: It causes the program to make my Windows kind of glitch out a little bit every now and then.

01:07:14.305 --> 01:07:17.448
[SPEAKER_03]: So that sucks because I have to reinstall Windows and that all makes sense.

01:07:18.835 --> 01:07:22.756
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, other than that, F you to the DMV.

01:07:23.256 --> 01:07:24.136
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the DMV?

01:07:24.196 --> 01:07:29.718
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I can't attack the stupid drivers anymore because you're still stupid and nothing's going to ever help you.

01:07:30.198 --> 01:07:34.759
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to yell at the DMV for letting you stupid drivers get on the roads in the first place.

01:07:35.019 --> 01:07:36.079
[SPEAKER_03]: You're fucking stupid.

01:07:36.399 --> 01:07:40.300
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you know, let people take the test and fail the test numerous times.

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:43.821
[SPEAKER_03]: Say, well, I tried to start by putting them on the roads.

01:07:45.023 --> 01:07:45.704
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate you!

01:07:46.004 --> 01:07:46.864
[SPEAKER_03]: You're stupid!

01:07:47.265 --> 01:07:49.266
[SPEAKER_03]: You're part of the government, which makes you worse!

01:07:49.506 --> 01:07:51.748
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the government sucks!

01:07:51.808 --> 01:07:53.909
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I expand on that?

01:07:53.929 --> 01:07:56.070
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

01:07:56.151 --> 01:07:56.411
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:07:57.712 --> 01:08:01.434
[SPEAKER_03]: This also, you know, NFBs to old people.

01:08:01.454 --> 01:08:04.016
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know what?

01:08:04.756 --> 01:08:09.820
[SPEAKER_03]: I think after a certain age, you outlive your usefulness, and you should be put down.

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:12.541
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some people who've been in the green room.

01:08:14.463 --> 01:08:19.467
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to see now old people, okay?

01:08:20.267 --> 01:08:21.128
[SPEAKER_03]: They're stupid.

01:08:21.889 --> 01:08:22.369
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate them.

01:08:23.270 --> 01:08:26.953
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, actually, also, F you for, uh, reality TV shows.

01:08:27.653 --> 01:08:29.054
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I love reality TV.

01:08:29.074 --> 01:08:32.057
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop popping up like freaking, I don't know what, dammit.

01:08:32.377 --> 01:08:33.538
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the fucking plague.

01:08:33.838 --> 01:08:34.919
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a, it's like a TV.

01:08:34.979 --> 01:08:36.060
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what, we're gonna watch people's

01:08:37.244 --> 01:08:37.984
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep themselves in the head!

01:08:38.185 --> 01:08:39.945
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what, we're gonna watch Brides get mad!

01:08:40.066 --> 01:08:44.148
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree, you know what, that Bridezilla, Man vs. Beast, all that shit, completely useless.

01:08:44.188 --> 01:08:45.869
[SPEAKER_02]: But surreal life, best show ever.

01:08:46.629 --> 01:08:49.791
[SPEAKER_22]: But that Bridezilla thing is the reason why I want it alone.

01:08:50.071 --> 01:08:57.515
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, um, I did find it funny though that they had, uh, 100 Mitch, or like 50 Mitch's pull a jet and had him against the elephant.

01:08:57.595 --> 01:08:59.596
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Mitch pulling anything is funny.

01:09:00.937 --> 01:09:01.797
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but yeah.

01:09:01.957 --> 01:09:02.818
[SPEAKER_03]: So you watched it!

01:09:03.378 --> 01:09:04.619
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I saw the commercial.

01:09:04.999 --> 01:09:05.099
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

01:09:06.488 --> 01:09:08.329
[SPEAKER_03]: I WATCHED THE COMMERCIAL!

01:09:08.969 --> 01:09:09.609
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

01:09:09.849 --> 01:09:17.092
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so, um, also, another FU to Crowded Arcade, because I don't like coin lines that are 16 coins long.

01:09:17.272 --> 01:09:25.535
[SPEAKER_03]: One, no one can figure out what turn they're up, and also, um, I don't like waiting, like, 20 minutes between games, or half an hour or whatnot.

01:09:27.035 --> 01:09:31.237
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, pretty weak, but that's my FU.

01:09:31.337 --> 01:09:31.797
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.

01:09:31.817 --> 01:09:33.998
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU of the week!

01:09:34.941 --> 01:09:40.544
[SPEAKER_02]: goes to Brad for making me late for that last segment so that Jamie could have her way with making fun of me.

01:09:43.696 --> 01:09:46.117
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like to also give an F you to the coin line.

01:09:46.377 --> 01:09:47.777
[SPEAKER_02]: I've ranted about this weeks ago.

01:09:48.458 --> 01:09:49.558
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely useless.

01:09:49.938 --> 01:09:51.018
[SPEAKER_02]: It's useless these days.

01:09:51.278 --> 01:09:56.940
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the days of Street Fighter when everybody would like watch everybody else play and stuff, it kept places a little better.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:00.061
[SPEAKER_02]: When people use custom coins, I guess it kind of works.

01:10:00.861 --> 01:10:02.702
[SPEAKER_02]: But the way it is now, it doesn't work.

01:10:02.742 --> 01:10:03.802
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a sign-up sheet.

01:10:03.962 --> 01:10:04.723
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck the coin line.

01:10:04.763 --> 01:10:05.123
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it.

01:10:05.603 --> 01:10:06.103
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stupid.

01:10:06.503 --> 01:10:07.784
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to cut in front of everybody.

01:10:09.164 --> 01:10:11.665
[SPEAKER_02]: Until you get a better system, I play first.

01:10:15.427 --> 01:10:27.658
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my other FU goes toward not having a Duo RX because I want to play Strider and Sapphire.

01:10:27.698 --> 01:10:27.938
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

01:10:42.614 --> 01:10:43.314
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for sharing that.

01:10:43.355 --> 01:10:45.596
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go around the room and hear our guest's FU's of the week.

01:10:47.017 --> 01:10:49.799
[SPEAKER_33]: What are you handing me the mic for?

01:10:50.259 --> 01:10:54.582
[SPEAKER_33]: Only thing I gotta fuck you is, you know, as much as he's given the U.S.

01:10:54.642 --> 01:10:59.705
[SPEAKER_33]: lately, I'd like to put a fuck you out to Itagaki for completely lying to the U.S.

01:10:59.745 --> 01:11:04.388
[SPEAKER_33]: about DOA Extreme Beach Volleyball and pushing back the next Virtua Cup for another year.

01:11:04.748 --> 01:11:05.208
[SPEAKER_33]: Fuck you.

01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:08.070
[SPEAKER_02]: Any FU's of the week, Brad?

01:11:08.250 --> 01:11:09.431
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU goes to drama.

01:11:09.451 --> 01:11:09.871
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

01:11:11.624 --> 01:11:13.084
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I have an FU for drama, too.

01:11:13.144 --> 01:11:13.605
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks.

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.566
[SPEAKER_02]: No more drama in my life.

01:11:18.686 --> 01:11:20.466
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, wait, I have my anthem.

01:11:20.726 --> 01:11:23.507
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my anthem because I'm so sick of drama.

01:11:23.607 --> 01:11:24.727
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had it with drama.

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:25.908
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want no more drama.

01:11:26.548 --> 01:11:28.868
[SPEAKER_02]: I have... No, wait, I have my anthem.

01:11:28.928 --> 01:11:29.268
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

01:11:29.548 --> 01:11:30.849
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, I've got it somewhere.

01:11:30.909 --> 01:11:31.269
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is it?

01:11:31.309 --> 01:11:34.690
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it, damn it.

01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:35.230
[SPEAKER_18]: Shit.

01:11:35.850 --> 01:11:36.410
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it somewhere.

01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:36.790
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:38.791
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to my computer for being unorganized.

01:11:41.437 --> 01:11:41.997
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll find it.

01:11:43.938 --> 01:11:45.678
[SPEAKER_02]: F this song, this song's so annoying.

01:11:45.758 --> 01:11:47.039
[SPEAKER_05]: You picked it.

01:11:47.439 --> 01:11:48.899
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I did.

01:11:49.899 --> 01:11:51.660
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck this paper airplane!

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:57.862
[SPEAKER_03]: F you the random-ish eartrick for picking bad songs all the time.

01:11:57.882 --> 01:11:59.262
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you made me late for the last segment.

01:11:59.962 --> 01:12:02.823
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like playing QD Chaser three times in a row, thank you, random.

01:12:04.264 --> 01:12:05.924
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to play QD Chaser how many times in a row?

01:12:06.044 --> 01:12:08.085
[SPEAKER_03]: Three times in a row, so it's a random suck.

01:12:09.449 --> 01:12:11.610
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't find my song, piss me off.

01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:12.090
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.

01:12:12.150 --> 01:12:14.732
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well, I guess another time.

01:12:14.832 --> 01:12:15.152
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well.

01:12:15.272 --> 01:12:15.992
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well, a hopeless quest.

01:12:16.012 --> 01:12:18.414
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, let's read the chatroom FUs, shall we?

01:12:32.076 --> 01:12:39.312
[SPEAKER_02]: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Fuck being tired, fuck algebra 2 that is, fuck algebra 2 and fuck me for not being able to type

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:42.741
[SPEAKER_02]: EOSFEB!

01:12:42.821 --> 01:12:44.061
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you to people with fuck yous.

01:12:44.602 --> 01:12:45.602
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you have to be mad about?

01:12:45.622 --> 01:12:46.803
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a new Matrix trailer.

01:12:47.283 --> 01:12:48.104
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, I take that back.

01:12:48.524 --> 01:12:54.707
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you to all the sportsbooks here who paid the Raiders to throw the game after overly hyping how much ass the Raiders were going to kick ass.

01:12:54.727 --> 01:12:56.548
[SPEAKER_02]: The house always wins because the people make stupid bets.

01:12:56.568 --> 01:12:59.290
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about there's nothing to be fucking mad about?

01:12:59.530 --> 01:13:01.391
[SPEAKER_03]: The Matrix movie isn't out yet.

01:13:01.431 --> 01:13:02.131
[SPEAKER_03]: Throw up the trailer.

01:13:02.191 --> 01:13:04.213
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that to wait like three months for the movie?

01:13:04.233 --> 01:13:05.533
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too long!

01:13:05.633 --> 01:13:06.074
Oh, Christ.

01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:11.901
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck the Daredevil movie.

01:13:12.562 --> 01:13:18.007
[SPEAKER_22]: Ben Affleck will make a shitty Daredevil and the chick that got to play Elektra looks nothing like her.

01:13:18.487 --> 01:13:19.448
[SPEAKER_22]: But I'm going to see it anyway.

01:13:20.349 --> 01:13:22.191
[SPEAKER_22]: And fuck me for wanting to see it.

01:13:22.291 --> 01:13:28.277
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, come on.

01:13:28.297 --> 01:13:29.458
[SPEAKER_03]: Elektra is Asian.

01:13:30.245 --> 01:13:31.366
[SPEAKER_03]: Her character's Asian.

01:13:31.846 --> 01:13:33.127
[SPEAKER_03]: The chicken alias is white.

01:13:33.627 --> 01:13:35.668
[SPEAKER_03]: And not just white, trailer trash white.

01:13:35.748 --> 01:13:37.129
[SPEAKER_22]: They needed to get Tia Carrere to play her.

01:13:37.729 --> 01:13:39.250
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, or Asian Carrere.

01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:40.330
[SPEAKER_03]: Tia Carrere is the shit.

01:13:43.212 --> 01:13:46.053
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking... Dean's World is the shit.

01:13:46.133 --> 01:13:47.394
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not Lucy Liu, man.

01:13:47.494 --> 01:13:48.754
[SPEAKER_03]: Ugh, Lucy Liu sucks.

01:13:49.195 --> 01:13:52.716
[SPEAKER_03]: How about the chick from Crutch and Tigger Didn't Drag?

01:13:53.217 --> 01:13:53.537
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, um...

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:56.202
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, yeah, the one that was in Rush Hour 2.

01:13:56.242 --> 01:14:00.005
[SPEAKER_03]: She would have been fucking awesome, because she taught and she kicked ass.

01:14:00.025 --> 01:14:01.146
[SPEAKER_03]: She actually knows martial arts.

01:14:01.186 --> 01:14:04.288
[SPEAKER_03]: The chick in Alias is just a fucking little wannabe bitch.

01:14:04.729 --> 01:14:07.551
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we should have a later segment, by the way, about Kung Fu Wins.

01:14:07.571 --> 01:14:10.013
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what some people would like to point out?

01:14:10.133 --> 01:14:13.656
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if the chick that plays Elektra doesn't look like her, Jennifer Garner gots ass.

01:14:13.957 --> 01:14:15.498
[SPEAKER_02]: That ass could make J-Lo cry.

01:14:15.738 --> 01:14:18.220
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, you're desperate, because she is fucking ugly.

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:19.902
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, Elektra is Asian.

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:21.742
[SPEAKER_02]: You are desperate.

01:14:22.663 --> 01:14:26.068
[SPEAKER_02]: Bluheimer wanted to share the trailer trash white would be a cool new Crayola color.

01:14:28.291 --> 01:14:34.861
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I'd rather see Final Destination 2, because I heard people get killed very violently in funny ways.

01:14:34.961 --> 01:14:35.301
[SPEAKER_24]: Cool!

01:14:36.656 --> 01:14:39.380
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny Death is always fun.

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:42.724
[SPEAKER_02]: Except, you know what, this one time, I have another FU.

01:14:43.144 --> 01:14:53.117
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to F my best friend from high school, not literally, but I'd like to send out an FU to my best friend from high school because one day I was in a really shitty mood, and he said, I know how I'm going to cheer you up, Rob.

01:14:53.497 --> 01:14:55.440
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to my house to watch Faces of Death.

01:14:58.090 --> 01:15:03.896
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we started watching Faces of Death, and I'm sorry, just, you don't watch it when you're already feeling sad.

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:05.417
[SPEAKER_03]: That movie's hilarious!

01:15:05.437 --> 01:15:06.278
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?

01:15:06.318 --> 01:15:06.999
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so hilarious!

01:15:07.179 --> 01:15:08.300
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so hilarious!

01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:15.888
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that one of the guys, the guy with the station wagon that puts a rocket on the back and wings on it, and it flies over the river, he explodes mid-air.

01:15:16.068 --> 01:15:16.989
[SPEAKER_03]: What a dumbass!

01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:21.213
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw some guy, he was skydiving, and he gets eaten by a crocodile.

01:15:21.233 --> 01:15:22.194
[SPEAKER_02]: It was disgusting.

01:15:23.567 --> 01:15:25.448
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was gross.

01:15:25.548 --> 01:15:30.030
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, you know what, you know what, quote, horror movie, end quote, had funny deaths?

01:15:30.330 --> 01:15:30.451
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

01:15:30.471 --> 01:15:31.751
[SPEAKER_22]: It was all the Nightmare on Elm Street movies.

01:15:32.031 --> 01:15:33.352
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Nightmare on Elm Street movies.

01:15:33.372 --> 01:15:34.072
[SPEAKER_22]: That was funny deaths.

01:15:34.192 --> 01:15:41.656
[SPEAKER_02]: Movie funny deaths are cool because you always laugh and go, oh, how did they do that, you know, type thing, and oh, movie special effects are so funny.

01:15:42.617 --> 01:15:44.898
[SPEAKER_22]: Like in the first... Like the chick that got turned into a cockroach.

01:15:45.178 --> 01:15:48.620
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I'm thinking from the very first Final Destination, that chick that gets hit by the bus.

01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:50.361
[SPEAKER_02]: I laughed so fucking hard.

01:15:50.381 --> 01:15:50.541
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway...

01:15:53.712 --> 01:15:54.213
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, moving on.

01:15:54.233 --> 01:15:54.853
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to the chat room.

01:15:55.194 --> 01:15:56.135
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to the chat room, my friends.

01:15:56.155 --> 01:15:56.595
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

01:15:59.278 --> 01:15:59.939
[SPEAKER_02]: Whack-whack.

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.002
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you to chat cookie.

01:16:04.471 --> 01:16:05.912
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck the Raiders, they suck.

01:16:05.992 --> 01:16:10.335
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck the UC Davis IT people for taking two weeks to fix the connection in the dorm.

01:16:10.915 --> 01:16:13.457
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck the fact that I still haven't played 2DX Iscandia yet.

01:16:13.497 --> 01:16:18.000
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck the fact that no one responded to my post in Comp Sci Class News Group asking for a program partner.

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:21.042
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a partner so I can finish my next program by Wednesday.

01:16:21.562 --> 01:16:25.585
[SPEAKER_02]: And fuck sexual frustration, especially at 18 and away at college and a virgin.

01:16:25.825 --> 01:16:26.025
[SPEAKER_02]: Aww.

01:16:26.886 --> 01:16:28.106
[SPEAKER_18]: Poor baby.

01:16:28.126 --> 01:16:28.687
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Loki.

01:16:28.707 --> 01:16:30.848
[SPEAKER_03]: That's information you don't want to give out on the air.

01:16:30.928 --> 01:16:33.010
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like being hungry in a fast food joint.

01:16:34.139 --> 01:16:34.920
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, exactly.

01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:39.342
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't order from the menu, there's something wrong there.

01:16:39.803 --> 01:16:40.903
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you know what?

01:16:41.724 --> 01:16:45.906
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to get laid... But see, the thing is, he has a girlfriend who's saving herself.

01:16:45.926 --> 01:16:47.447
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in love and all this stuff, you know.

01:16:47.928 --> 01:16:53.912
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we can't exactly just go take him to a bar, get him drunk, and get the little chick drunk and say, okay, here's the bed.

01:16:54.112 --> 01:16:55.372
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard this story before, too.

01:16:55.713 --> 01:16:56.133
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

01:16:56.293 --> 01:16:58.855
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the game Road Trip, it had something very similar.

01:16:59.275 --> 01:17:02.197
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in love, you know, they're way at college...

01:17:02.857 --> 01:17:08.662
[SPEAKER_03]: and I believe, uh, what was it, uh, I forget his name, but anyways, it's like, your penis will never forgive you.

01:17:08.723 --> 01:17:12.006
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do not take this opportunity.

01:17:12.866 --> 01:17:15.048
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna pack up my balls and leave.

01:17:15.068 --> 01:17:20.373
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay, there's plenty of pussy wanting to be a pussy there, we call it.

01:17:20.393 --> 01:17:20.974
[SPEAKER_34]: Take it there.

01:17:22.885 --> 01:17:25.366
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to get laid, we will get you laid.

01:17:25.706 --> 01:17:27.067
[SPEAKER_02]: It just won't be your girlfriend.

01:17:27.127 --> 01:17:27.567
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

01:17:27.827 --> 01:17:31.889
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure she's a nice lady, but if she ain't going to open the legs, she ain't going to get in.

01:17:31.909 --> 01:17:32.570
[SPEAKER_02]: In defense.

01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:32.690
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

01:17:32.770 --> 01:17:33.190
[SPEAKER_02]: No defense.

01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:33.870
[SPEAKER_02]: Overruled.

01:17:43.684 --> 01:17:44.384
[SPEAKER_02]: Objection!

01:17:46.946 --> 01:17:48.686
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that it's admirable.

01:17:49.727 --> 01:17:51.928
[SPEAKER_21]: You think that it's admirable?

01:17:52.108 --> 01:17:52.328
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

01:17:52.928 --> 01:17:54.729
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the thing, though.

01:17:54.809 --> 01:17:58.811
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're not going to because you're not mean.

01:17:58.831 --> 01:17:59.752
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's what I say.

01:18:01.192 --> 01:18:02.993
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure she's a wonderful girl.

01:18:03.373 --> 01:18:06.574
[SPEAKER_02]: All the girls I dated in high school were saving themselves for marriage, too.

01:18:06.895 --> 01:18:09.055
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to point out, I turned out gay.

01:18:09.436 --> 01:18:10.376
[SPEAKER_02]: So be careful.

01:18:10.556 --> 01:18:11.656
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't make Ryan gay.

01:18:11.796 --> 01:18:12.497
[SPEAKER_02]: He won't like it.

01:18:12.617 --> 01:18:15.078
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this might have been popular back in the 90s.

01:18:15.218 --> 01:18:15.378
[SPEAKER_03]: 1890s?

01:18:15.478 --> 01:18:17.679
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, not today.

01:18:17.779 --> 01:18:19.620
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, hello, get with the times here.

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:20.880
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't do that shit no more.

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:21.960
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they do, they're lying.

01:18:22.961 --> 01:18:25.442
[SPEAKER_20]: For the record, for the record, okay.

01:18:27.038 --> 01:18:35.522
[SPEAKER_22]: I said that I was going to save myself for the one person who I was going to spend the rest of my life with, and I did, because I'm going to marry Dan.

01:18:36.843 --> 01:18:40.805
[SPEAKER_22]: And so there are people with morals in this world.

01:18:40.925 --> 01:18:45.127
[SPEAKER_17]: Screw morals, order some GHB online, that'll get you laid real quick.

01:18:45.648 --> 01:18:47.649
[SPEAKER_22]: Although I'm currently living in San Francisco.

01:18:47.729 --> 01:18:48.769
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what it boils down to.

01:18:51.545 --> 01:18:54.387
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to put out for the horny 18 year old.

01:18:54.607 --> 01:19:03.513
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen lady, when you're 35 and you're at your sexual peak and no guy's going to have sex with you, don't come whining to us.

01:19:09.226 --> 01:19:11.967
[SPEAKER_03]: You may think that, but no, that ain't gonna happen.

01:19:12.147 --> 01:19:18.168
[SPEAKER_03]: By then, by then it's like this, okay, you're trying, you're trying, you're trying, oh, fuck it, you know, I give up, I'm gonna go build a car.

01:19:18.568 --> 01:19:21.328
[SPEAKER_03]: And then she's like, I want you now, come on.

01:19:21.348 --> 01:19:24.229
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm trying to fucking build my car, what the fuck are you trying to do?

01:19:24.249 --> 01:19:25.809
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to get, trying to have sex with me?

01:19:25.829 --> 01:19:26.990
[SPEAKER_03]: Where were you 20 years ago?

01:19:27.210 --> 01:19:27.770
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:29.690
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you like it now, huh?

01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:31.911
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's what boils down to right there.

01:19:32.331 --> 01:19:34.111
[SPEAKER_33]: Shoes on the other hand now, isn't it?

01:19:36.850 --> 01:19:41.154
[SPEAKER_21]: These guys are deplorable.

01:19:41.334 --> 01:19:42.935
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know the meaning of the word.

01:19:44.056 --> 01:19:45.117
[SPEAKER_20]: Rob, go to dictionary.com.

01:19:45.137 --> 01:19:47.379
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, okay, I'm going to dictionary.com right now.

01:19:47.399 --> 01:19:51.522
[SPEAKER_20]: I will define the word deplorable for you thanks to dictionary.com.

01:19:51.603 --> 01:19:52.804
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you know what?

01:19:52.824 --> 01:19:56.707
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Lab's FU has just stopped the FU's of the Week segment while we look this stuff up.

01:19:57.347 --> 01:19:58.348
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll resume it in a minute.

01:19:58.869 --> 01:19:59.849
[SPEAKER_02]: D-L-O-R-A-B-L-E

01:20:04.787 --> 01:20:05.267
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

01:20:06.368 --> 01:20:09.989
[SPEAKER_22]: Get top ten most popular... Mortivere, condemnation, or reproach.

01:20:10.529 --> 01:20:11.910
[SPEAKER_22]: Lamentable, woeful.

01:20:12.450 --> 01:20:13.550
[SPEAKER_22]: Wretched, bad.

01:20:14.811 --> 01:20:16.852
[SPEAKER_22]: As in, damn you suck!

01:20:19.393 --> 01:20:20.113
[SPEAKER_22]: Deplorable.

01:20:20.253 --> 01:20:22.034
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the fourth definition there, I think.

01:20:22.394 --> 01:20:24.735
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, the dictionary according to Jamie.

01:20:26.296 --> 01:20:27.896
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, are we ready to resume the FUs of the week?

01:20:27.936 --> 01:20:29.457
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys all stop talking about sex now...

01:20:34.562 --> 01:20:37.124
[SPEAKER_22]: You got that?

01:20:37.144 --> 01:20:38.465
[SPEAKER_22]: Dick is in, go choke on life.

01:20:40.486 --> 01:20:44.929
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, Brad's giving me head, life on air.

01:20:45.009 --> 01:20:45.549
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:20:46.410 --> 01:20:47.191
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good radio.

01:20:47.231 --> 01:20:48.231
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet our radios would go up.

01:20:48.391 --> 01:20:49.772
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, that's what we need to do.

01:20:49.832 --> 01:20:50.693
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we've done drunk.

01:20:51.559 --> 01:20:54.941
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we need to have the sex show, where we have people get laved live on air.

01:20:55.262 --> 01:20:56.242
[SPEAKER_22]: I wouldn't be here for that.

01:20:56.422 --> 01:20:56.963
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll be at home.

01:20:57.023 --> 01:21:00.505
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll have the violence show, where we kill something.

01:21:00.885 --> 01:21:03.407
[SPEAKER_21]: Where I take a sledgehammer and go chasing after a bunny.

01:21:04.628 --> 01:21:05.709
[SPEAKER_21]: No bunnies!

01:21:05.809 --> 01:21:06.629
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't kill bunnies!

01:21:06.649 --> 01:21:07.290
[SPEAKER_21]: Sweet!

01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:09.351
[SPEAKER_21]: Bunnies are cute!

01:21:09.771 --> 01:21:11.713
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are the name of Oolong!

01:21:14.515 --> 01:21:16.196
[SPEAKER_23]: We know what happened to Oolong.

01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:18.911
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's a pancake, it's a target.

01:21:19.192 --> 01:21:20.713
[SPEAKER_09]: No!

01:21:21.934 --> 01:21:22.955
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys are awful.

01:21:23.575 --> 01:21:24.856
[SPEAKER_21]: Rob, I like bunnies too.

01:21:25.657 --> 01:21:26.338
[SPEAKER_02]: For dinner!

01:21:26.858 --> 01:21:27.899
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are awful.

01:21:27.919 --> 01:21:29.060
[SPEAKER_21]: No, Rob's gonna get a bunny.

01:21:30.221 --> 01:21:31.002
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna get a bunny.

01:21:32.002 --> 01:21:34.464
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna poop little round things all over your house.

01:21:34.745 --> 01:21:36.006
[SPEAKER_02]: I only eat the cute animals.

01:21:36.066 --> 01:21:37.367
[SPEAKER_02]: You can potty train your bunny.

01:21:37.667 --> 01:21:39.969
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm an otter!

01:21:40.029 --> 01:21:41.570
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we get back to the chatroom FUs, please?

01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:42.811
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, you don't have to get on here.

01:21:43.132 --> 01:21:43.532
[SPEAKER_19]: What are you?

01:21:43.932 --> 01:21:44.573
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm a cow!

01:21:44.813 --> 01:21:45.494
[SPEAKER_19]: Get on the train!

01:21:46.991 --> 01:21:47.531
Dennis Leary.

01:21:48.532 --> 01:21:49.232
[SPEAKER_34]: Moving on.

01:21:51.133 --> 01:21:52.573
[SPEAKER_19]: Just bring out a whole cow.

01:21:52.854 --> 01:21:55.655
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll cobra off what I want and ride the rest home.

01:21:57.816 --> 01:21:58.836
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dennis Leary.

01:22:00.797 --> 01:22:04.859
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya says, a mammoth king-sized FU to the sapphire worm.

01:22:06.818 --> 01:22:07.138
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is that?

01:22:07.338 --> 01:22:08.039
[SPEAKER_03]: Slow it down.

01:22:08.919 --> 01:22:10.380
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, oh, okay.

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:19.827
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, because he, like, isn't able to, uh... I think he wasn't able to connect to the station for a while or something.

01:22:19.847 --> 01:22:23.789
[SPEAKER_02]: Dwayne says, F you to football.

01:22:24.490 --> 01:22:27.712
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the new Stepmania build with exit bugs and background change bugs.

01:22:28.613 --> 01:22:30.454
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to himself with big black cocks.

01:22:30.714 --> 01:22:35.917
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to everyone who doesn't like his so-called freestyle double routine to the whistle song complete with pelvic thrusts on freezes.

01:22:36.038 --> 01:22:36.418
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

01:22:37.439 --> 01:22:39.200
[SPEAKER_02]: Blackwing, whatever, why don't you go cry me a river?

01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:39.701
[SPEAKER_03]: Blow me a crap?

01:22:39.741 --> 01:22:40.361
[SPEAKER_03]: Get over it, guys.

01:22:40.421 --> 01:22:41.662
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the other cliche.

01:22:41.682 --> 01:22:43.103
[SPEAKER_03]: Maple... Maple... Says... Excuse me.

01:22:43.203 --> 01:22:43.824
[SPEAKER_03]: Maple says... What?

01:23:01.670 --> 01:23:02.290
[SPEAKER_23]: Ask the Mormon.

01:23:02.910 --> 01:23:03.170
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

01:23:03.771 --> 01:23:04.731
[SPEAKER_23]: Just look at me.

01:23:04.831 --> 01:23:05.751
[SPEAKER_23]: I am Mormon.

01:23:05.791 --> 01:23:07.332
[SPEAKER_23]: Charge I. I must be God.

01:23:07.672 --> 01:23:09.192
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't touch my nipples.

01:23:09.712 --> 01:23:11.393
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if this is St.

01:23:11.413 --> 01:23:13.473
[SPEAKER_05]: Patrick's Day, but if you were in St.

01:23:13.513 --> 01:23:15.354
[SPEAKER_05]: Patrick's Day, I don't know.

01:23:15.374 --> 01:23:18.695
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in Ireland, it's a lot more orange than orange.

01:23:18.715 --> 01:23:23.436
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would actually remember an orange whoever pinched me that kicked the ball.

01:23:23.456 --> 01:23:27.417
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'd be like, excuse me, this is the... Anyway, back to the movie here.

01:23:28.516 --> 01:23:29.697
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I read Maples F you now?

01:23:29.877 --> 01:23:30.638
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I will.

01:23:31.198 --> 01:23:31.618
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay.

01:23:32.139 --> 01:23:32.459
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to?

01:23:32.499 --> 01:23:32.959
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

01:23:33.179 --> 01:23:33.860
[SPEAKER_02]: No, now you're good.

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:34.700
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck is fuck you.

01:23:36.687 --> 01:23:44.613
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you to my sickness, making me sleep a huge amount of hours, and missing the Super Bowl.

01:23:44.633 --> 01:23:46.454
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you didn't miss anything.

01:23:46.514 --> 01:23:48.756
[SPEAKER_02]: Raiders got fucked in the ass and they played a Matrix trailer.

01:23:48.936 --> 01:23:49.757
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the Super Bowl.

01:23:49.917 --> 01:23:51.818
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are the football games called bowls?

01:23:51.958 --> 01:23:53.800
[SPEAKER_09]: You should save those for, like, bowling.

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:54.540
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a fruit bowl?

01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:55.941
[SPEAKER_09]: You should save those for bowling.

01:23:55.961 --> 01:23:56.101
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah!

01:23:56.121 --> 01:23:56.722
[SPEAKER_09]: Clow bowling!

01:23:56.742 --> 01:23:57.222
[SPEAKER_09]: Clow bowling.

01:24:01.292 --> 01:24:01.934
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Google.

01:24:02.014 --> 01:24:03.397
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay, we'll go Google.

01:24:03.958 --> 01:24:06.023
[SPEAKER_34]: Orange Lounge goes to Coldwell.

01:24:06.043 --> 01:24:07.487
[SPEAKER_34]: Without you listeners.

01:24:07.948 --> 01:24:08.870
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, without you listeners.

01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:09.411
[SPEAKER_02]: It's private.

01:24:09.431 --> 01:24:09.692
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:24:12.411 --> 01:24:23.093
[SPEAKER_02]: DDRAngel says, my one F you for this week goes to people who are your best friends who are supposed to support you in your decisions no matter what, but they end up disagreeing with you and making you feel shitty, even though you're making a decision you believe in.

01:24:23.814 --> 01:24:24.914
[SPEAKER_18]: I have something to say about that.

01:24:25.014 --> 01:24:25.954
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

01:24:26.034 --> 01:24:31.475
[SPEAKER_22]: If a person isn't your friend and they don't listen to what you're doing, it's going to end up hurting you in the long run.

01:24:32.016 --> 01:24:34.256
[SPEAKER_22]: They are a better friend than not supporting you.

01:24:34.276 --> 01:24:34.796
[SPEAKER_20]: It's, you know...

01:24:39.456 --> 01:24:50.966
[SPEAKER_18]: It takes courage to stand up to your enemy, and more courage to stand up to your enemy.

01:24:51.087 --> 01:25:03.918
[SPEAKER_22]: And if your friend sees something, or has experience like that, that, you know, is going to say that this experience that you're going through right now is going to come back and bite you in the ass, you better listen to your friend's advice.

01:25:05.257 --> 01:25:07.298
[SPEAKER_22]: Especially if that person has the experience to know us.

01:25:07.439 --> 01:25:10.981
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't discount your friend just because they're showing a little bit of concern for you, okay?

01:25:11.601 --> 01:25:13.162
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless they're drunk, then don't listen to them.

01:25:13.182 --> 01:25:14.563
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, please don't listen to them.

01:25:14.583 --> 01:25:19.647
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, this orange lounge suddenly got deep.

01:25:20.707 --> 01:25:28.214
[SPEAKER_22]: And don't listen to them when they say that some girl likes you, because even though they may be their best friend and they may know them for like years, they're wrong and they like you.

01:25:47.771 --> 01:25:48.732
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:23.605
[SPEAKER_22]: If they've had experience that maybe something that you're going through right now isn't necessarily something that might be good for you, if they see potential harm in what you're doing, you'd best appreciate that kind of advice because it takes a lot of bravery to tell your friends, I don't think what you're doing is the right thing.

01:26:23.965 --> 01:26:28.846
[SPEAKER_22]: It takes a shallow person to just agree with everything just because they want to keep you as a friend.

01:26:29.526 --> 01:26:33.789
[SPEAKER_22]: It takes a really strong person to say, you know, I disagree with you, and this is why.

01:26:34.809 --> 01:26:36.450
[SPEAKER_22]: So, that's all it is.

01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:38.772
[SPEAKER_22]: You just have to keep an open mind toward what your friends tell you.

01:26:40.713 --> 01:26:41.013
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

01:26:41.753 --> 01:26:46.176
[SPEAKER_02]: Although Angel says she was drunk, so... Okay, if the person was drunk, then just screw it.

01:26:48.397 --> 01:26:50.739
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, we appreciated deep thoughts with Jamie.

01:26:51.099 --> 01:26:52.360
[SPEAKER_02]: Now back to the pornography chat.

01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:52.700
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

01:26:55.157 --> 01:27:03.223
[SPEAKER_02]: Chubbs says, I can't think of any FUs, so FU to Jack in the Box again for taking away the 99 cent Westerner.

01:27:03.964 --> 01:27:05.385
[SPEAKER_02]: How was his FU last week?

01:27:06.906 --> 01:27:07.187
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:27:09.568 --> 01:27:14.993
[SPEAKER_02]: Stresso wants to get laid live on air, so he's volunteering to come down for that show.

01:27:15.013 --> 01:27:15.313
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:27:19.959 --> 01:27:21.960
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat Cookie says, Fuck you, Black Lab.

01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:23.880
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just jealous of my chocolate chips.

01:27:24.461 --> 01:27:28.222
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I want to send out an FU to everyone that's envious of my sweet perfections.

01:27:30.262 --> 01:27:31.063
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a robot.

01:27:33.403 --> 01:27:37.845
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, 23rd Bagus has a special little FU this week.

01:27:38.545 --> 01:27:43.806
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm even giving him his own song because he begged and pleaded enough and I just wanted him to stop begging because it was getting sad.

01:27:43.886 --> 01:27:45.587
[SPEAKER_02]: So, he's saying...

01:27:46.792 --> 01:27:48.453
[SPEAKER_02]: My life is so full of bliss.

01:27:48.573 --> 01:27:49.734
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no F you for the week.

01:27:50.254 --> 01:27:51.755
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, however, have something different.

01:27:51.996 --> 01:27:54.357
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to send a love you to DGR Angel.

01:27:54.758 --> 01:27:56.339
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you be my Bimani girl?

01:27:57.580 --> 01:27:58.940
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just that, something deeper.

01:27:59.101 --> 01:28:01.963
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you and I'm willing to make sure we are together and forever.

01:28:02.083 --> 01:28:03.083
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the song, get it?

01:28:03.564 --> 01:28:04.184
[SPEAKER_02]: How about you?

01:28:04.244 --> 01:28:06.185
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you stay with me forever?

01:28:07.226 --> 01:28:07.626
[SPEAKER_16]: That was cute.

01:28:10.179 --> 01:28:13.021
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many serious moments here on Horse Lounge Radio.

01:28:15.743 --> 01:28:19.066
[SPEAKER_02]: And people getting laid, and it's not me, and that makes me cry.

01:28:21.768 --> 01:28:24.710
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, but I am getting a massage, so maybe I like wallowing in my pity here.

01:28:29.034 --> 01:28:29.914
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you crying?

01:28:30.275 --> 01:28:31.536
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, stop it, go give her a massage.

01:28:32.416 --> 01:28:32.817
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes she does.

01:28:37.984 --> 01:28:38.964
[SPEAKER_09]: Touch me and I'll break your finger.

01:29:06.166 --> 01:29:07.006
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know what?

01:29:07.026 --> 01:29:09.788
[SPEAKER_03]: We never did get the answer here.

01:29:10.308 --> 01:29:14.070
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

01:29:17.753 --> 01:29:18.233
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:29:19.233 --> 01:29:21.395
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet it went to private message, tee-hee.

01:29:22.042 --> 01:29:23.043
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's not fair!

01:29:24.403 --> 01:29:25.844
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, we got big hugs.

01:29:26.284 --> 01:29:26.985
[SPEAKER_02]: Big hugs.

01:29:27.505 --> 01:29:29.286
[SPEAKER_02]: And oh my god, OMG.

01:29:29.586 --> 01:29:30.426
[SPEAKER_02]: We got an OMG!

01:29:31.047 --> 01:29:31.527
[SPEAKER_11]: OMG!

01:29:32.528 --> 01:29:32.808
[SPEAKER_02]: OMG!

01:29:33.288 --> 01:29:33.808
[SPEAKER_02]: OMG!

01:29:33.868 --> 01:29:34.909
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know me.

01:29:35.369 --> 01:29:35.649
[SPEAKER_02]: OMG!

01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:37.470
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:38.691
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

01:29:38.911 --> 01:29:39.431
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

01:29:40.052 --> 01:29:41.973
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm checking some... You down with entropy?

01:29:46.075 --> 01:29:47.235
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's check the mailboxes.

01:29:47.275 --> 01:29:47.956
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to check the mail.

01:29:52.027 --> 01:29:55.474
[SPEAKER_02]: USFVB says, being here during this makes me feel gay.

01:29:57.739 --> 01:29:59.242
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's Jamie's town that makes you gay.

01:29:59.302 --> 01:30:00.645
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Orange Lodge.

01:30:04.507 --> 01:30:06.628
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Angel wants me to say what she said in chat.

01:30:06.648 --> 01:30:07.148
[SPEAKER_02]: I already did.

01:30:07.408 --> 01:30:07.768
[SPEAKER_02]: OMG.

01:30:08.748 --> 01:30:08.969
[SPEAKER_19]: Omg.

01:30:09.349 --> 01:30:10.769
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay, I didn't read the first part.

01:30:10.789 --> 01:30:13.470
[SPEAKER_02]: She caution drops to the ground in shock for a few moments.

01:30:14.990 --> 01:30:17.031
[SPEAKER_02]: Then she finds the energy to get up and hugs Magus.

01:30:17.211 --> 01:30:17.551
[SPEAKER_02]: OMG.

01:30:18.151 --> 01:30:20.992
[SPEAKER_19]: OMG, OMG, OMG, OMG, OMG, OMG.

01:30:22.453 --> 01:30:23.373
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take another quick break.

01:30:23.393 --> 01:30:25.314
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back with this week's cage match.

01:30:26.974 --> 01:30:27.835
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because.

01:30:28.135 --> 01:30:30.657
[SPEAKER_02]: Word.

01:30:30.697 --> 01:30:35.221
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be right back after this quick little break featuring... Me breaking stuff.

01:30:36.442 --> 01:30:37.282
[SPEAKER_02]: Breaking stuff.

01:30:37.863 --> 01:30:40.825
[SPEAKER_02]: And a song from Dance Mania.

01:30:41.025 --> 01:30:43.767
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because we feel like playing something from Dance Mania.

01:30:43.787 --> 01:30:45.809
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to play some booty Dance Mania?

01:30:46.069 --> 01:30:46.469
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:50.052
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, how about... I know I've got one.

01:30:50.572 --> 01:30:51.393
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I'm trying to find it.

01:30:51.853 --> 01:30:52.154
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.

01:30:52.214 --> 01:30:53.815
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, some booty Dance Mania.

01:30:53.835 --> 01:30:54.115
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you go.

01:30:54.576 --> 01:30:54.936
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back.

01:33:25.109 --> 01:33:26.154
Blow my whistle baby

01:34:53.852 --> 01:34:55.094
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you for watching!

01:35:41.002 --> 01:35:42.443
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

01:36:07.273 --> 01:36:08.774
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching.

01:36:08.794 --> 01:36:10.315
[SPEAKER_13]: Please subscribe to my channel.

01:36:38.394 --> 01:36:39.677
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching

01:36:54.557 --> 01:36:58.118
[SPEAKER_01]: The following bit of randomness has been brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

01:37:12.631 --> 01:37:12.911
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi!

01:37:14.071 --> 01:37:15.792
[SPEAKER_02]: We almost had a... Ask Mike.

01:37:16.792 --> 01:37:17.652
[SPEAKER_22]: My God, Rob.

01:37:17.693 --> 01:37:18.933
[SPEAKER_02]: I was sitting on the mic, my bad.

01:37:18.953 --> 01:37:19.613
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm going to fart.

01:37:19.693 --> 01:37:20.073
[SPEAKER_34]: Sorry.

01:37:20.093 --> 01:37:20.793
[SPEAKER_34]: Sorry.

01:37:21.013 --> 01:37:22.854
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to fuck you.

01:37:23.654 --> 01:37:26.575
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay, back to the fuck you's of the week.

01:37:26.615 --> 01:37:29.136
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck you to the United States government and our president.

01:37:30.552 --> 01:37:40.561
[SPEAKER_22]: for this whole stupid decision about attacking Iraq and all that, because this is only really for a very personal reason.

01:37:40.581 --> 01:37:46.687
[SPEAKER_22]: My brother is a Marine, and he has to go to Kuwait next month.

01:37:46.707 --> 01:37:47.748
[SPEAKER_22]: So, fuck all of it.

01:37:49.469 --> 01:37:49.869
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

01:37:50.089 --> 01:37:55.752
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't understand when there's all these countries that are against the war.

01:37:56.372 --> 01:37:57.213
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

01:37:57.253 --> 01:37:58.153
[SPEAKER_02]: He ain't popular with me.

01:37:58.193 --> 01:38:00.214
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I wouldn't have ever voted for the guy in the first place.

01:38:00.294 --> 01:38:01.295
[SPEAKER_22]: You couldn't vote for him anyway.

01:38:01.355 --> 01:38:02.095
[SPEAKER_22]: I voted Green Party.

01:38:02.876 --> 01:38:03.776
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.

01:38:03.816 --> 01:38:07.998
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the whole war is stupid, and I think Bush is just asking for trouble, and he's not going to get reelected.

01:38:08.018 --> 01:38:08.998
[SPEAKER_02]: I voted Donald Duck.

01:38:10.879 --> 01:38:11.700
[SPEAKER_02]: Donald Duck in 2004.

01:38:15.403 --> 01:38:18.186
[SPEAKER_22]: I think when his reelection comes up, we should all vote for Strong Bad.

01:38:19.387 --> 01:38:20.928
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we'll vote for Strong Bad, that's fine.

01:38:21.349 --> 01:38:22.089
[SPEAKER_22]: From Homestar Runner.

01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:28.795
[SPEAKER_22]: Everybody go to homestarrunner.com after the show and read the Strong Bad email.

01:38:29.075 --> 01:38:29.416
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

01:38:29.896 --> 01:38:34.000
[SPEAKER_02]: We've said our piece because we don't want to turn this into a completely political show.

01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:37.723
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to send him a letter that says, fuck you right in your ear because your ass ain't good enough.

01:38:40.313 --> 01:38:42.434
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're not having a political debate, that's it.

01:38:42.574 --> 01:38:45.414
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got personal reasons for being against it, so that's that.

01:38:46.475 --> 01:38:47.895
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on.

01:38:50.976 --> 01:38:52.096
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, what are we moving on to?

01:38:52.156 --> 01:38:52.816
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, the cage match.

01:38:52.836 --> 01:38:55.817
[SPEAKER_22]: By the way, I don't give a shit about politics, so there.

01:38:57.337 --> 01:38:58.798
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, moving on.

01:38:58.978 --> 01:39:01.138
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk cage match politics right now.

01:39:01.198 --> 01:39:03.059
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the politics that are important on this show right now.

01:39:06.030 --> 01:39:06.410
[SPEAKER_02]: We could.

01:39:06.430 --> 01:39:07.311
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have anything actual?

01:39:07.511 --> 01:39:08.012
[SPEAKER_02]: Sim update.

01:39:08.032 --> 01:39:08.953
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, give us a sim update.

01:39:09.073 --> 01:39:10.234
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get the show back on track.

01:39:10.914 --> 01:39:11.755
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay!

01:39:11.855 --> 01:39:12.435
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay!

01:39:12.916 --> 01:39:14.958
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

01:39:14.998 --> 01:39:20.822
[SPEAKER_03]: Earlier this week, well, actually, a couple of websites are going through a couple of changes.

01:39:21.603 --> 01:39:28.289
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a big Bomani-style bitch fest going on, and they're redoing some stuff.

01:39:29.890 --> 01:39:32.492
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't like the fact that people were leeching files off their site.

01:39:33.613 --> 01:39:39.717
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, you don't mean Bomani Style, you mean, well, hold on, keep going, never mind, I've got to get something cute up here.

01:39:39.978 --> 01:39:48.424
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah, other than that, DDR Mania X, they had a whole site relaunched with a brand new design to it, so it's kind of pretty.

01:39:49.144 --> 01:39:51.366
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's pretty cool, they have that going on.

01:39:52.166 --> 01:39:59.511
[SPEAKER_03]: See, other than that, Bomani Style is releasing brand new, well, actually, they're the same DDR Extreme files, but now they have backgrounds in them.

01:40:00.032 --> 01:40:00.232
[SPEAKER_03]: Woohoo!

01:40:00.979 --> 01:40:13.880
[SPEAKER_03]: and so those will be coming up pretty soon they have like three up right now and let's see other than that here let me cut you off for just a second because I wanted to say it's not Bomani style it's

01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:25.741
[SPEAKER_02]: The Money Style, because goddamn, they do everything for this community.

01:40:26.061 --> 01:40:29.462
[SPEAKER_02]: They bend over backwards and they died on the cross for this community.

01:40:40.485 --> 01:40:43.408
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to put the announcer files up on your site?

01:40:43.468 --> 01:40:44.449
[SPEAKER_03]: Chatroom's wondering.

01:41:06.129 --> 01:41:10.731
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I am, and I've ripped the announcer files from DDR Extreme with, uh, yeah!

01:41:11.191 --> 01:41:12.331
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got that on there, too.

01:41:12.691 --> 01:41:17.453
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not slamming on any other websites, by the way, but just, you know, the whole Jesus Complex.

01:41:17.613 --> 01:41:18.354
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the internet.

01:41:18.414 --> 01:41:19.714
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody leeches from everybody.

01:41:19.754 --> 01:41:20.854
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole concept.

01:41:21.275 --> 01:41:22.215
[SPEAKER_02]: God, if you don't...

01:41:22.850 --> 01:41:25.891
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't want people to be doing it, don't post it.

01:41:26.011 --> 01:41:27.672
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it doesn't make sense, you guys.

01:41:28.072 --> 01:41:28.472
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop.

01:41:28.933 --> 01:41:29.413
[SPEAKER_02]: Be nice.

01:41:29.653 --> 01:41:30.473
[SPEAKER_02]: Be nice to each other.

01:41:30.493 --> 01:41:31.094
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all we want.

01:41:31.254 --> 01:41:32.374
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's another thing.

01:41:32.394 --> 01:41:34.315
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, like, wondering why people are turned away from the site.

01:41:34.335 --> 01:41:34.675
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's see.

01:41:34.695 --> 01:41:36.556
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some of your mods that they got to slip.

01:41:36.776 --> 01:41:37.997
[SPEAKER_03]: Slip some mod on that site.

01:41:38.197 --> 01:41:40.758
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get into personally bashing people on this show.

01:41:40.938 --> 01:41:42.399
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, he had some pretty funny comments.

01:41:42.439 --> 01:41:43.339
[SPEAKER_03]: I like reading his stuff.

01:41:43.399 --> 01:41:46.700
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when he's ripping on stupid people, that's hilarious.

01:41:47.241 --> 01:41:47.681
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um...

01:41:48.161 --> 01:41:51.124
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, see, other than that, let's see some stuff I forgot last week.

01:41:51.164 --> 01:42:00.694
[SPEAKER_03]: There was this, um, um, it was a DDR, sort of Amani-related, uh, DDR, like, e-magazine type thing that went out.

01:42:00.714 --> 01:42:02.876
[SPEAKER_03]: It had some pretty funny stuff.

01:42:03.577 --> 01:42:07.261
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to print it out, but it was on my zip drive, so unfortunately I couldn't do that.

01:42:07.341 --> 01:42:09.563
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of alright, made by some Canadians, I think.

01:42:11.185 --> 01:42:26.255
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, let's see, aside from all that stuff, um, oh, DWI Insanity, they just released Easy to Dancer songs, a whole pack of those that are DWIs now, so go check those out, those are pretty cool.

01:42:26.535 --> 01:42:29.297
[SPEAKER_03]: Links on DDR Maniacs if you want to check that out.

01:42:29.898 --> 01:42:36.262
[SPEAKER_03]: And always just, you know, keep watching their forums, there's going to be, you know, files to release and whatnot.

01:42:36.883 --> 01:42:36.983
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

01:42:37.683 --> 01:42:43.228
[SPEAKER_03]: See, DDR East Coast Invasion is going to be doing another Tourney Mix, I'm sure, Tourney Mix 4.

01:42:43.568 --> 01:42:46.110
[SPEAKER_03]: They're talking about doing one every three months, I think.

01:42:46.150 --> 01:42:48.592
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'd probably put it in April.

01:42:49.293 --> 01:42:56.939
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're also running a contest right now where if you... It's a B-Mani music remixing contest.

01:42:56.999 --> 01:42:58.580
[SPEAKER_03]: You just pick songs, remix them.

01:42:58.981 --> 01:43:03.204
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to be somewhere from one and a half minutes to, I believe, four minutes in length.

01:43:03.604 --> 01:43:03.744
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

01:43:10.467 --> 01:43:13.529
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Lab wants to know, when is there going to be a DDR sim for Max, goddammit?

01:43:14.609 --> 01:43:15.109
[SPEAKER_03]: For what?

01:43:15.469 --> 01:43:16.490
[SPEAKER_02]: Max, Macintoshes.

01:43:17.610 --> 01:43:18.170
[SPEAKER_03]: For Max?

01:43:18.891 --> 01:43:21.832
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well there sort of is right now, there's um...

01:43:23.059 --> 01:43:26.282
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit, now I remember what it was called.

01:43:26.322 --> 01:43:28.223
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one that was for multiple platforms.

01:43:28.784 --> 01:43:34.648
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it was Pi DDR, but there was one that was for multiple platforms that I posted a long time ago.

01:43:35.449 --> 01:43:37.230
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, I don't know.

01:43:38.271 --> 01:43:38.511
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

01:43:38.551 --> 01:43:39.151
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just maxed it.

01:43:39.171 --> 01:43:40.472
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they don't make Sims for him.

01:43:40.793 --> 01:43:43.735
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, get out of his lap, man!

01:43:44.996 --> 01:43:47.658
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm giving him a lap dance during the show.

01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:55.594
[SPEAKER_03]: And no news on Feet of Fury, it's supposed to be finished in March, I think.

01:43:55.634 --> 01:43:58.138
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Feet is Fury.

01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:00.961
Yeah!

01:44:00.981 --> 01:44:04.546
[SPEAKER_22]: I know the game's so bad it makes you grow up into a little lizard.

01:44:04.566 --> 01:44:04.926
What Fury?

01:44:10.132 --> 01:44:17.460
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Lab wanted me to ask if you guys were interested in doing... There's actually some new programming coming to Orange Lounge in the very new future.

01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:21.965
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the Johnny the Homicidal Maniac special, the drama that's going to be... When's that finished?

01:44:21.985 --> 01:44:24.187
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we know when that's going to be finished?

01:44:24.227 --> 01:44:24.667
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel sick.

01:44:24.728 --> 01:44:24.908
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

01:44:25.048 --> 01:44:26.029
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't really know.

01:44:26.069 --> 01:44:26.710
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't heard from her.

01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:29.673
[SPEAKER_22]: I actually have to re-record my lines for the Psychic Lady.

01:44:29.693 --> 01:44:30.334
[SPEAKER_22]: Ah, okay.

01:44:30.894 --> 01:44:37.659
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be having a new music show coming that's going to be debuting soon as soon as I get the list from you guys.

01:44:37.699 --> 01:44:39.080
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't even told Loki about it yet.

01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:43.182
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I'm always on loop, both at work and life and everything.

01:44:44.023 --> 01:44:46.464
[SPEAKER_02]: But you guys will be sending me these.

01:44:46.484 --> 01:44:48.025
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have a long version program.

01:44:48.085 --> 01:44:51.728
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had a lot of requests to play more long version Bomani musics.

01:44:52.168 --> 01:44:55.030
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have a Bomani music block at some point.

01:44:55.050 --> 01:45:03.657
[SPEAKER_02]: We might do it at a certain time every day for like an hour, but just like some long versions because we've had some requests to play more long stuff on Orange Moms Radio.

01:45:03.677 --> 01:45:05.819
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do long versions of your favorite Bomani songs.

01:45:06.659 --> 01:45:07.280
[SPEAKER_18]: I like it a lot.

01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:08.220
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have an orange mold.

01:45:29.227 --> 01:45:30.507
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like fun.

01:45:30.927 --> 01:45:31.808
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie's raising her hand.

01:45:32.248 --> 01:45:34.128
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could like all overact on air and stuff.

01:45:34.168 --> 01:45:34.548
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be fun.

01:45:34.568 --> 01:45:35.168
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me talk about it.

01:45:35.648 --> 01:45:37.149
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up, you bastard!

01:45:38.989 --> 01:45:42.570
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go get my grandmother to come kill me now!

01:45:45.330 --> 01:45:47.211
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to let you see your baby.

01:45:48.211 --> 01:45:51.992
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, well I'm an alien twin from another planet.

01:45:52.532 --> 01:45:53.912
[SPEAKER_03]: I came here to steal your socks.

01:45:57.298 --> 01:46:00.839
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't have any multiple personalities, but my other ones do.

01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:03.160
[SPEAKER_22]: All five of them.

01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:05.060
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're twins.

01:46:05.301 --> 01:46:10.642
[SPEAKER_11]: And worst of all, I never learned to read!

01:46:10.662 --> 01:46:15.103
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like this, y'all were so cool!

01:46:17.464 --> 01:46:17.884
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

01:46:17.904 --> 01:46:19.385
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not nerds here!

01:46:20.825 --> 01:46:21.405
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

01:46:21.885 --> 01:46:23.146
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that all you have to say about SimNews?

01:46:24.485 --> 01:46:29.367
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing going on because people are lazy in school and distracted by the Super Bowl.

01:46:29.447 --> 01:46:32.528
[SPEAKER_03]: I want some of your nuts, Brad.

01:46:32.628 --> 01:46:33.709
[SPEAKER_02]: These are good, thank you.

01:46:34.069 --> 01:46:35.789
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm a non-nut person.

01:46:35.809 --> 01:46:36.690
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate nuts.

01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:37.870
[SPEAKER_02]: Nuts suck.

01:46:39.831 --> 01:46:40.751
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like nuts, man.

01:46:41.632 --> 01:46:42.912
[SPEAKER_03]: Your cashews are in the living room here.

01:46:49.675 --> 01:46:51.995
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to get to the cage match now, finally.

01:46:52.756 --> 01:46:52.936
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

01:46:54.238 --> 01:46:57.280
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week, in the big, fat, hairy, scary cage match.

01:46:57.300 --> 01:47:00.963
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, I don't even have a song picked for this weekend, so I've got to pick it right now.

01:47:02.364 --> 01:47:03.305
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm going to do it.

01:47:03.365 --> 01:47:04.005
[SPEAKER_18]: You already won.

01:47:04.526 --> 01:47:04.806
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

01:47:05.847 --> 01:47:06.467
[SPEAKER_22]: You can pick your song.

01:47:06.667 --> 01:47:07.208
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

01:47:07.828 --> 01:47:14.173
[SPEAKER_22]: Remember, you can pick your nose, you can pick your friends, and you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friend's cage match song.

01:47:14.533 --> 01:47:22.459
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week, on the Orange Bounce cage match, we had, in a very narrow victory over that Eat Em Up song by FX Twin...

01:47:24.625 --> 01:47:30.189
[SPEAKER_02]: The winner of last week's Cage Match was Ayumi Hamasaki with M, the Above and Beyond remix.

01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:37.995
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, by the way, the Cage Match, for those that don't know, we play three songs, most just pick each song, and you can vote.

01:47:38.355 --> 01:47:44.000
[SPEAKER_02]: You can vote for last week's winner, you can vote for one of the two new songs, and the winning song goes into rotation.

01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:50.948
[SPEAKER_02]: During Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani Music and More Program, which plays all the time on this station when we're not here.

01:47:51.589 --> 01:47:53.271
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is last week's winner.

01:47:53.291 --> 01:47:54.893
[SPEAKER_02]: We're only going to play a small clip of it.

01:47:55.334 --> 01:47:57.697
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Ayumi Hamasaki with M, and you can vote for this.

01:47:57.717 --> 01:47:59.700
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first thing you can vote for in this week's stage match.

01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:12.901
Thank you for watching!

01:49:05.745 --> 01:49:06.386
Thank you for watching!

01:49:42.072 --> 01:49:45.837
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that was last week's winner, Yumi Hamasaki with M, so that's the first thing you can vote for.

01:49:46.699 --> 01:49:51.906
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know what, I don't give a fuck if this is, uh, you know, a little, uh, private shit.

01:49:52.186 --> 01:49:56.071
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, you fucking bitch twin, I didn't fucking diss slip, I was...

01:49:56.852 --> 01:50:04.677
[SPEAKER_03]: Making a comment about how Slip causes people that not want to be talking on the forums because anyone that says anything stupid, he will go off on them.

01:50:04.957 --> 01:50:06.478
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say anything bad about that.

01:50:06.538 --> 01:50:07.199
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

01:50:07.219 --> 01:50:09.320
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, people like doing that.

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:12.422
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell, I like joking with stupid people and making fun of them.

01:50:12.702 --> 01:50:13.402
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my thing.

01:50:13.842 --> 01:50:15.803
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't make fun of Slip at all.

01:50:15.923 --> 01:50:16.363
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

01:50:16.463 --> 01:50:21.424
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're doing a good job on that site, even though they don't like leechers and that kind of thing.

01:50:21.484 --> 01:50:22.624
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, that's their thing.

01:50:23.044 --> 01:50:25.365
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't ever say anything bad about Slip at all.

01:50:25.405 --> 01:50:25.865
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know what?

01:50:25.885 --> 01:50:28.465
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go fuck yourself and your fucking band.

01:50:28.505 --> 01:50:29.605
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not talking to you, mister.

01:50:29.825 --> 01:50:31.086
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're my best friend.

01:50:31.106 --> 01:50:31.566
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

01:50:31.926 --> 01:50:33.906
[SPEAKER_03]: Go fuck yourself there in Florida.

01:50:34.026 --> 01:50:36.747
[SPEAKER_03]: Find some old hag and go fuck yourself, okay?

01:50:37.347 --> 01:50:38.027
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy!

01:50:38.307 --> 01:50:47.490
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize no one from Change the Channel listens to this show, but on the off chance that there's one of you listening, do yourselves a favor and ban Twin from your channel.

01:50:48.510 --> 01:50:48.871
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

01:50:49.211 --> 01:50:54.992
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize we don't get along, we don't see eye to eye on everything, dudes that run that place, but you know what?

01:50:55.613 --> 01:50:58.413
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, human to human, just do yourself a favor, ban him.

01:50:58.653 --> 01:50:59.714
[SPEAKER_22]: First of all, you know what?

01:51:00.274 --> 01:51:04.415
[SPEAKER_22]: And as for Twin, I put Twin in the same category that I put Slip.

01:51:05.536 --> 01:51:06.776
[SPEAKER_22]: People I don't pay attention to.

01:51:07.355 --> 01:51:08.016
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, fair enough.

01:51:08.116 --> 01:51:09.257
[SPEAKER_02]: No more personal drama on this show.

01:51:09.277 --> 01:51:10.578
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't we say fuck drama earlier?

01:51:11.018 --> 01:51:11.278
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.

01:51:11.298 --> 01:51:12.579
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I'm saying fuck it now.

01:51:12.599 --> 01:51:13.260
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.

01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:14.401
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, it's stupid.

01:51:14.661 --> 01:51:15.562
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we do a cage match now?

01:51:15.682 --> 01:51:15.822
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

01:51:15.882 --> 01:51:17.003
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's do the cage match.

01:51:17.263 --> 01:51:18.964
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, speaking of cage match.

01:51:19.885 --> 01:51:21.086
[SPEAKER_22]: My song owns all of you.

01:51:21.166 --> 01:51:21.687
[SPEAKER_22]: Just play it.

01:51:21.947 --> 01:51:22.788
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here it is.

01:51:22.808 --> 01:51:24.049
[SPEAKER_02]: Vincent D'Amour with Eternity.

01:51:24.169 --> 01:51:27.711
[SPEAKER_02]: Vincent D'Amour with Eternity is Jamie's pick for this week's cage match.

01:51:27.752 --> 01:51:28.092
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

01:51:29.253 --> 01:51:36.519
[SPEAKER_17]: Imagine there's a place in the light you see

01:51:37.774 --> 01:51:39.557
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not only in your imagination.

01:51:41.741 --> 01:51:45.688
[SPEAKER_06]: This is our reality.

01:51:45.708 --> 01:51:46.209
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you feel it?

01:51:46.249 --> 01:51:48.173
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me take you all the way.

01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:31.951
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

01:52:59.468 --> 01:53:00.491
Thank you for watching!

01:54:08.478 --> 01:54:09.060
and many more.

01:55:00.510 --> 01:55:01.611
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, neat.

01:55:01.791 --> 01:55:03.212
[SPEAKER_02]: That was in the cage match.

01:55:03.973 --> 01:55:06.655
[SPEAKER_02]: Vincent Damore with Eternity, the full vocal remix.

01:55:07.556 --> 01:55:12.980
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I have a controversial pick for this week's cage match.

01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:15.422
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry, yes, we have to go around the room and rate it.

01:55:15.822 --> 01:55:16.242
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad.

01:55:16.723 --> 01:55:17.724
[SPEAKER_02]: Ten for Eternity.

01:55:17.764 --> 01:55:18.644
[SPEAKER_02]: Any particular reason why?

01:55:18.684 --> 01:55:18.984
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:55:19.025 --> 01:55:19.205
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki.

01:55:29.315 --> 01:55:38.881
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it, but it's like, it's just, I don't know, it's a bit more, it's an 8, I don't know, because I like all this stuff, but it's not even, like, scandalous.

01:55:38.941 --> 01:55:40.262
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, that's something I never heard before.

01:55:41.643 --> 01:55:45.005
[SPEAKER_34]: Uh, you didn't even hear the song, did you, that we just did?

01:55:45.025 --> 01:55:45.405
[SPEAKER_34]: What song?

01:55:45.725 --> 01:55:47.086
[SPEAKER_34]: Uh, Eternity by some more.

01:55:47.566 --> 01:55:48.206
[SPEAKER_34]: I've heard it.

01:55:48.607 --> 01:55:49.127
[SPEAKER_34]: What do you think?

01:55:49.707 --> 01:55:55.471
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, I think it's a very classic, I agree with Loki, it's not like they jumped out and went, Holy crap!

01:55:57.822 --> 01:55:59.143
[SPEAKER_23]: But it's really good, I like it.

01:55:59.964 --> 01:56:01.025
[SPEAKER_23]: It's very classic.

01:56:01.125 --> 01:56:05.109
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd rate it about, for him, I'd rate it about a 7 overall.

01:56:09.494 --> 01:56:11.616
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Vincent D'Amour.

01:56:11.876 --> 01:56:12.797
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Vincent D'Amour.

01:56:12.857 --> 01:56:13.317
[SPEAKER_02]: I give it a 9.

01:56:14.118 --> 01:56:14.519
[SPEAKER_02]: Eternity.

01:56:14.559 --> 01:56:18.322
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the best Vincent D'Amour song, but it's pretty damn cool and I wouldn't be sad if it won.

01:56:18.943 --> 01:56:21.546
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's what we all think of this week's Skate Matches.

01:56:22.046 --> 01:56:48.895
[SPEAKER_02]: That pick, Vincent Damore with Eternity Now I have a kind of controversial one This is from a trance compilation and unfortunately I don't have the name of the artist that did this I have it somewhere, I just don't have it on me right now I can tell you this comes from the Velfire Cybertrance compilation This is track 4 and this is a remix of Thunderstruck Which was by ACDC originally Which is a group I don't particularly care for usually But I know Jamie really likes them and she does not like this mix at all

01:56:49.835 --> 01:56:51.018
[SPEAKER_22]: I already know what I'm giving it.

01:56:51.839 --> 01:56:52.460
[SPEAKER_02]: A one.

01:56:52.861 --> 01:56:54.705
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, but judge for yourself.

01:56:54.765 --> 01:56:57.190
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the third entry in the cage match this week.

01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:58.713
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a remix of Thunderstruck.

01:56:58.793 --> 01:56:59.033
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

01:57:35.932 --> 01:57:50.443
[SPEAKER_16]: And I knew there was no turning back My mind raced and I thought, what could I do And I knew there was no help, no help from you Thunder

01:58:25.607 --> 01:58:26.329
Thanks for watching!

01:59:22.336 --> 01:59:23.698
Thank you for watching!

02:00:24.389 --> 02:00:28.871
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that was from the Vellfire Cybertrans CD, Thunder.

02:00:29.931 --> 02:00:30.492
[SPEAKER_02]: A little remix.

02:00:30.592 --> 02:00:31.912
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm about to throw up.

02:00:33.193 --> 02:00:35.674
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Jamie, dare I ask, what did you think of Thunder?

02:00:36.134 --> 02:00:36.734
[SPEAKER_18]: Negative 12.

02:00:37.615 --> 02:00:41.416
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, I love this song.

02:00:42.537 --> 02:00:47.479
[SPEAKER_18]: And I like how they simulated the guitar rest of the keyboard.

02:00:47.659 --> 02:00:49.319
[SPEAKER_20]: But I hate that it even exists.

02:00:49.339 --> 02:00:52.081
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a song you should never transmix a CD to.

02:00:55.783 --> 02:00:56.043
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

02:00:59.207 --> 02:01:01.950
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like the original, and I hated the remix.

02:01:02.471 --> 02:01:03.893
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you don't mix that together.

02:01:03.913 --> 02:01:06.416
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like mixing Ozzy Osbourne and Vince Samore.

02:01:06.456 --> 02:01:08.999
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just... It doesn't make any sense.

02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:10.280
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

02:01:10.701 --> 02:01:11.041
[SPEAKER_03]: Awful one.

02:01:11.061 --> 02:01:12.303
[SPEAKER_03]: Even better, uh...

02:01:14.190 --> 02:01:17.752
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think of that Brad?

02:01:18.253 --> 02:01:19.894
[SPEAKER_03]: I caught like the last five seconds.

02:01:21.414 --> 02:01:23.356
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it a 10.

02:01:23.556 --> 02:01:27.218
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't hear it, but now that I think I understand what it was, it was Thunderstock?

02:01:27.258 --> 02:01:28.739
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but it was a cool transmit.

02:01:28.879 --> 02:01:29.619
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that's cool.

02:01:29.639 --> 02:01:30.900
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, that DJ should be blacklisted.

02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:34.002
[SPEAKER_03]: Never really allowed to do anything like that.

02:01:40.906 --> 02:01:42.147
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, fine.

02:01:42.167 --> 02:01:45.268
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm giving it a 10 simply to counterweight the rest of your votes.

02:01:45.288 --> 02:01:48.650
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, but you're dealing with two 1s and a minus 12.

02:01:49.970 --> 02:01:50.971
[SPEAKER_22]: Your 10 loses.

02:01:51.611 --> 02:01:51.991
[SPEAKER_02]: I give it a 10.

02:01:52.711 --> 02:01:51.991
10, 10, 10.

02:01:53.812 --> 02:01:55.172
[SPEAKER_22]: It gets an overall of negative 1.

02:01:58.062 --> 02:01:58.723
[SPEAKER_22]: I gave it a minus 12.

02:02:00.023 --> 02:02:02.125
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm giving it a zero.

02:02:03.045 --> 02:02:03.826
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, Loki.

02:02:04.166 --> 02:02:11.330
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so send in your votes right now over private message in the channel and we'll tally up those votes and have it for you later.

02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:15.653
[SPEAKER_02]: You can vote for either Ayumi Hamasaki, Tally Wacker.

02:02:20.196 --> 02:02:22.297
[SPEAKER_02]: You can vote for Vincent Damore with Eternity.

02:02:33.792 --> 02:02:35.574
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, gee, I guess there are no exciting parts, sorry.

02:02:35.935 --> 02:02:41.421
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the trance remix of Thunderstruck that nobody likes here at Orange Lounge is at me.

02:02:48.519 --> 02:02:52.361
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so you can vote for any one of those right now, right fucking now.

02:02:52.821 --> 02:02:53.881
[SPEAKER_22]: This should be called Blender.

02:02:54.381 --> 02:02:54.722
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:02:54.902 --> 02:02:55.282
[SPEAKER_02]: Blender.

02:02:56.142 --> 02:02:57.763
[SPEAKER_02]: And the winner goes into rotation.

02:02:59.844 --> 02:03:00.664
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Bomani Music War.

02:03:00.744 --> 02:03:01.044
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

02:03:01.104 --> 02:03:04.525
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give you all an STD live on air.

02:03:05.786 --> 02:03:08.267
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm getting weird looks.

02:03:09.427 --> 02:03:10.428
[SPEAKER_02]: AIDS for everyone!

02:03:12.881 --> 02:03:17.942
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going in the next intro.

02:03:18.463 --> 02:03:21.443
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm going to give all the little underprivileged children in the world AIDS.

02:03:21.683 --> 02:03:22.284
[SPEAKER_23]: Myself.

02:03:23.584 --> 02:03:24.464
[SPEAKER_02]: You're awful.

02:03:25.564 --> 02:03:26.905
[SPEAKER_02]: You're an awful person.

02:03:27.725 --> 02:03:31.786
[SPEAKER_22]: Brad will give them all AIDS and I'll give them a kick in the ass.

02:03:32.506 --> 02:03:35.067
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, because I'm Jared Fogle from Subway.

02:03:35.607 --> 02:03:38.688
[SPEAKER_22]: You'll give them AIDS and I'll give them a yeast infection.

02:03:41.409 --> 02:03:42.089
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

02:03:43.334 --> 02:03:49.155
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you keep it in a jar or something so you just open it up, can of yeast infection and dump it on somebody?

02:03:49.195 --> 02:03:52.876
[SPEAKER_22]: The little yeast infection goodies.

02:03:53.176 --> 02:03:54.697
[SPEAKER_22]: What disease would you like to transmit?

02:03:56.737 --> 02:03:59.138
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I could transmit the stupid, I guess.

02:04:02.358 --> 02:04:04.759
[SPEAKER_22]: I have the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie-woogie flu.

02:04:07.923 --> 02:04:09.224
[SPEAKER_02]: What disease do you want to transmit, Rob?

02:04:09.244 --> 02:04:10.685
[SPEAKER_02]: What disease do I want to transmit?

02:04:11.165 --> 02:04:11.505
[SPEAKER_02]: 2DX.

02:04:13.386 --> 02:04:16.068
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to transmit mental retardation.

02:04:16.448 --> 02:04:17.949
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to transmit the gay gene.

02:04:25.854 --> 02:04:27.876
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:04:43.590 --> 02:04:44.231
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't want women!

02:05:07.588 --> 02:05:08.329
[SPEAKER_22]: and then I hugged Armine.

02:05:10.070 --> 02:05:10.230
[SPEAKER_22]: Ow!

02:05:10.770 --> 02:05:12.211
[SPEAKER_02]: Lesbian sex, A+.

02:05:12.792 --> 02:05:14.573
[SPEAKER_02]: We need some hot lesbian action on Orange Lodge.

02:05:14.593 --> 02:05:16.515
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to call up Amanda and Yana and get them back on air.

02:05:16.555 --> 02:05:16.695
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

02:05:18.776 --> 02:05:21.598
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's sad though is that Yana moved to the Bay Area to be with Amanda.

02:05:21.838 --> 02:05:24.140
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I don't want to see my ex-girlfriend having lesbians.

02:05:28.483 --> 02:05:29.964
[SPEAKER_02]: What if your current girlfriend had lesbian sex?

02:05:29.984 --> 02:05:30.485
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that be okay?

02:05:32.287 --> 02:05:33.367
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, hey.

02:05:33.427 --> 02:05:34.647
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, hey.

02:05:34.728 --> 02:05:34.988
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:05:35.228 --> 02:05:36.628
[SPEAKER_22]: It would be better if you were involved.

02:05:36.908 --> 02:05:37.228
[SPEAKER_22]: Ow!

02:05:37.268 --> 02:05:40.149
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it wouldn't be officially lesbian.

02:05:41.209 --> 02:05:55.692
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's, see, any straight guy, any straight guy that wants to see lesbian sex has this, you know, thought in the back of his head that it's not really lesbian sex because they'll be all, oh, gosh, we're having lesbian sex and it's so great, but we really need a dick right now.

02:05:55.772 --> 02:05:56.472
[SPEAKER_02]: Join in.

02:05:56.492 --> 02:05:57.212
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know.

02:05:57.992 --> 02:06:00.453
[SPEAKER_03]: What they don't know is that they don't want the dick.

02:06:00.473 --> 02:06:02.013
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're lesbian sex.

02:06:02.713 --> 02:06:04.814
[SPEAKER_03]: They hate dick.

02:06:04.834 --> 02:06:05.374
[SPEAKER_03]: They're lesbians.

02:06:05.394 --> 02:06:06.715
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to get with you guys.

02:06:07.195 --> 02:06:07.615
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

02:06:08.735 --> 02:06:13.757
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, what I don't get is why guys are so hot about seeing, you know, two chicks getting it on.

02:06:14.237 --> 02:06:19.279
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you say earlier in the show about wanting to have that room at Golfland where the hot guys get it on with each other?

02:06:20.059 --> 02:06:27.602
[SPEAKER_22]: But yet, you know, a certain significant other of mine has a problem with me wanting to see two guys get it on.

02:06:28.702 --> 02:06:29.062
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

02:06:29.162 --> 02:06:30.823
[SPEAKER_22]: He's jealous of my Dojinshi collection.

02:06:32.210 --> 02:06:44.020
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand what the problem would be.

02:06:44.060 --> 02:06:48.303
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's like, I mean, hell, if I saw two lesbians, I wouldn't expect to be jumping in.

02:06:48.383 --> 02:06:49.965
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, hello, lesbian.

02:06:50.525 --> 02:06:52.427
[SPEAKER_03]: Meaning, they don't have sex with men.

02:06:53.331 --> 02:06:53.951
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just watching.

02:06:53.971 --> 02:06:57.332
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a porno without the TV and not the video, without the videotape.

02:06:57.412 --> 02:07:00.072
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and welcome to the real life, you know, thing here.

02:07:00.132 --> 02:07:01.472
[SPEAKER_03]: Most lesbians are pretty ugly.

02:07:01.812 --> 02:07:14.935
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, no, for guys, you know, I think, for guys, I think it's okay because I think it's, you know, an easier time for, you know, guys to get it on so women should actually have the advantage in seeing the yaoi thing.

02:07:15.475 --> 02:07:21.476
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, it's, I think, harder for girls to be stimulating without having the tools.

02:07:23.363 --> 02:07:23.904
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm confused, maybe.

02:07:23.924 --> 02:07:24.504
[SPEAKER_22]: It's more effort.

02:07:25.625 --> 02:07:26.426
[SPEAKER_03]: For girls, too?

02:07:26.466 --> 02:07:26.946
[SPEAKER_22]: I think so.

02:07:28.888 --> 02:07:29.729
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have skill.

02:07:30.249 --> 02:07:35.313
[SPEAKER_03]: See, girls, they have access to the equipment 24-7, so they know exactly what to do.

02:07:40.238 --> 02:07:43.801
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about how I jack my hot spicy boner every day, guys!

02:07:44.021 --> 02:07:47.544
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, see, guys can get themselves off at any given time, okay?

02:07:48.185 --> 02:07:49.125
[SPEAKER_03]: And girls can, too!

02:07:49.226 --> 02:07:50.106
[SPEAKER_03]: It just takes a little longer.

02:07:50.126 --> 02:07:50.607
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily!

02:07:51.565 --> 02:07:52.346
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Jamie.

02:07:52.366 --> 02:07:53.687
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not elaborating on that, though.

02:07:55.929 --> 02:07:56.950
[SPEAKER_22]: Chatroom, what do you think?

02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:58.051
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, talk to us.

02:07:58.071 --> 02:07:59.472
[SPEAKER_22]: Who has an easier time getting off?

02:07:59.672 --> 02:08:02.815
[SPEAKER_23]: How many girls are in the chatroom now that can tell us how quickly to get off?

02:08:02.855 --> 02:08:05.517
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it would take absolutely nothing for a guy to get off.

02:08:05.777 --> 02:08:07.059
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it could take me about five or ten seconds.

02:08:07.079 --> 02:08:08.540
[SPEAKER_22]: Guys pop boners at the most stupid things.

02:08:09.741 --> 02:08:12.443
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, when I first saw Metroid Prime... Oh...

02:08:15.980 --> 02:08:17.141
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean you don't get a clit on?

02:08:18.481 --> 02:08:19.722
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the porno last night?

02:08:19.742 --> 02:08:20.882
[SPEAKER_02]: They were talking about clit ons.

02:08:21.442 --> 02:08:22.783
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't work that way.

02:08:23.763 --> 02:08:25.124
[SPEAKER_22]: It does not work that way.

02:08:26.404 --> 02:08:28.165
[SPEAKER_22]: Because we're more sophisticated beings.

02:08:28.565 --> 02:08:29.706
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, oh, wait a minute.

02:08:30.786 --> 02:08:31.366
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

02:08:31.486 --> 02:08:33.547
[SPEAKER_22]: It takes more to simulate a woman.

02:08:35.588 --> 02:08:37.389
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes diesel-powered equipment.

02:08:40.459 --> 02:09:01.238
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to seriously give you that, I gotta give you a copy of that Sexcore TV, the movie, that's hilarious, she has, she has, okay, you know how they have those, um, uh, those, like, hedge clippers, you know, with the blade that goes up and down, okay, well, imagine that, but you strap a dildo to it, and she's just like, going, going at it with that.

[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when we come back... I found a funny site.

[SPEAKER_02]: This is episode number 30.

02:20:08.554 --> 02:20:10.335
[SPEAKER_02]: We're over the hill now.

02:20:10.635 --> 02:20:10.935
[SPEAKER_22]: No, that's 40.

[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when I hit 30, I'm going to be crying because I think I'm over the hill.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:16.920
[SPEAKER_22]: We're at our sexual peak.

[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lawn's radio is at its female sexual peak.

02:20:26.466 --> 02:20:28.047
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've been there and back.

02:20:28.067 --> 02:20:30.589
[SPEAKER_22]: You mean you've done a 30-year-old?

02:20:30.869 --> 02:20:31.770
[SPEAKER_02]: You've done a 30-year-old?

02:20:33.631 --> 02:20:34.111
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

02:20:34.592 --> 02:20:34.912
[SPEAKER_22]: Would you?

02:20:37.433 --> 02:20:38.694
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking about a woman here, right?

02:20:38.794 --> 02:20:39.054
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

02:20:40.936 --> 02:20:41.476
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

02:20:41.937 --> 02:20:42.797
[SPEAKER_03]: If she was hot enough.

02:20:43.958 --> 02:20:44.478
[SPEAKER_02]: I did one that was 28.

02:20:44.518 --> 02:20:45.399
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that count?

02:20:46.039 --> 02:20:46.259
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

02:20:46.620 --> 02:20:47.140
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

02:20:48.321 --> 02:20:48.521
[SPEAKER_02]: I was 17.

02:20:48.701 --> 02:20:49.381
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

02:20:49.461 --> 02:20:53.184
[SPEAKER_22]: What if she may not necessarily be hot, but was incredibly skilled?

02:20:55.751 --> 02:20:57.312
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:21:20.928 --> 02:21:24.409
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but see, now the whole thing with the swallowing, I don't even get that.

02:21:24.449 --> 02:21:25.829
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, who cares?

02:21:25.929 --> 02:21:26.470
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucks.

02:21:27.070 --> 02:21:29.290
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does, okay, she gets like the best out of both worlds.

02:21:29.310 --> 02:21:31.171
[SPEAKER_03]: She gets to eat and she gets to have sex.

02:21:31.611 --> 02:21:32.911
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck is up with that?

02:21:32.931 --> 02:21:40.413
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if I could have a, if I could have a pizza and be getting hit at the same time, man, I, I'd be the happiest guy in the world, man.

02:21:40.453 --> 02:21:42.134
[SPEAKER_03]: You're eating pizza, hey, good job.

02:21:43.945 --> 02:21:44.386
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what?

02:21:44.486 --> 02:21:46.468
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't see why people are so fascinated with that.

02:21:46.488 --> 02:21:47.389
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even understand that.

02:21:47.409 --> 02:21:47.890
[SPEAKER_03]: It's stupid.

02:21:47.930 --> 02:21:50.492
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like... I want to know what the advantage of putting something... Do you want a medal?

02:21:50.512 --> 02:21:51.453
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want a pat on the back?

02:21:51.594 --> 02:21:54.817
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to know what the advantage of putting something in your mouth that a guy pisses with.

02:21:55.238 --> 02:21:55.538
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay?

02:21:58.421 --> 02:22:02.986
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, uh... It goes both ways, you know?

02:22:06.599 --> 02:22:06.879
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:22:07.899 --> 02:22:12.601
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do a segment here that we did a couple weeks ago that everybody loved.

02:22:12.641 --> 02:22:13.421
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're doing it again.

02:22:14.241 --> 02:22:15.562
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Ask Orange Lounge.

02:22:15.702 --> 02:22:16.182
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

02:22:17.442 --> 02:22:21.363
[SPEAKER_02]: You can send us your questions over private message to me in the chat room right now.

02:22:22.644 --> 02:22:25.364
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll answer them live here on air.

02:22:25.384 --> 02:22:27.165
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to start with a question from EOSFVB.

02:22:28.641 --> 02:22:32.482
[SPEAKER_02]: Who says, I am trying to compile a list of places to have sex.

02:22:33.462 --> 02:22:35.142
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Cast, please help me.

02:22:35.803 --> 02:22:38.783
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to clarify, he is in Vegas, and he says yes.

02:22:39.343 --> 02:22:43.884
[SPEAKER_02]: And he already has listed at the Tropicana because they have mirrors on the ceiling in every room.

02:22:44.104 --> 02:22:45.245
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Tropicana is taken care of.

02:22:45.685 --> 02:22:47.805
[SPEAKER_02]: So, places the OSFBB needs to have sex.

02:22:50.086 --> 02:22:50.546
[SPEAKER_02]: In Vegas.

02:22:50.886 --> 02:22:51.966
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been to Vegas.

02:22:52.006 --> 02:22:52.946
[SPEAKER_02]: You've never been to Vegas.

02:22:53.186 --> 02:22:53.686
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been to Vegas.

02:22:53.826 --> 02:22:56.167
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have sex at Gypsy.

02:22:58.916 --> 02:23:00.897
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully he catches the reference.

02:23:01.097 --> 02:23:05.498
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that place that was in Showgirls?

02:23:05.798 --> 02:23:06.358
[SPEAKER_02]: The Cheetah.

02:23:06.599 --> 02:23:08.039
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, you need to get a lap dance at the Cheetah.

02:23:08.119 --> 02:23:09.599
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you need to get a lap dance at the Cheetah.

02:23:11.240 --> 02:23:14.181
[SPEAKER_22]: And then rent a nice room at the Monte Carlo.

02:23:14.921 --> 02:23:15.261
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

02:23:16.802 --> 02:23:17.742
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Monte Carlo's good.

02:23:18.062 --> 02:23:20.483
[SPEAKER_22]: He does for classy.

02:23:20.663 --> 02:23:22.183
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many whorehouses.

02:23:22.403 --> 02:23:22.663
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

02:23:22.683 --> 02:23:25.404
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have sex in the desert next to a cactus.

02:23:25.564 --> 02:23:26.365
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be fun.

02:23:26.625 --> 02:23:27.265
[SPEAKER_22]: And then eat it.

02:23:30.095 --> 02:23:32.075
[SPEAKER_22]: Eat some peyote and then have sex.

02:23:32.215 --> 02:23:32.896
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.

02:23:33.196 --> 02:23:35.056
[SPEAKER_02]: And get some free sex flyers, too.

02:23:35.076 --> 02:23:35.596
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be cool.

02:23:35.876 --> 02:23:40.357
[SPEAKER_22]: You can get those cards that have the transgendered women on there.

02:23:41.417 --> 02:23:44.138
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you need to have sex with somebody transgendered.

02:23:44.158 --> 02:23:44.698
[SPEAKER_02]: That would work.

02:23:45.058 --> 02:23:48.859
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how they have those lunch cards where they punch them and stuff?

02:23:48.879 --> 02:23:51.459
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to get one of those for a prostitute because that would be hilarious.

02:23:51.639 --> 02:23:52.419
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.

02:23:54.220 --> 02:23:55.660
[SPEAKER_02]: Where else in Vegas does he need to have sex?

02:23:55.700 --> 02:23:56.140
[SPEAKER_02]: How about...

02:23:58.172 --> 02:24:00.674
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that spinning guitar at the Hard Rock Hotel.

02:24:02.376 --> 02:24:04.397
[SPEAKER_22]: The basement at the Excalibur.

02:24:04.738 --> 02:24:06.279
[SPEAKER_02]: The basement of the Excalibur.

02:24:06.999 --> 02:24:08.100
[SPEAKER_22]: On the Technomotion machine.

02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:09.902
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, okay, on the Technomotion machine.

02:24:11.003 --> 02:24:11.483
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

02:24:11.583 --> 02:24:18.329
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have sex at Caesar's Palace in the forums, like on the fountain with the animatronic Neptune guy.

02:24:18.849 --> 02:24:19.970
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you need to have sex.

02:24:20.270 --> 02:24:21.872
[SPEAKER_03]: On top of the pirate ship that burns.

02:24:22.012 --> 02:24:22.252
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes!

02:24:23.053 --> 02:24:24.594
[SPEAKER_02]: On a pirate ship in Treasure Island.

02:24:24.934 --> 02:24:25.755
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, good one.

02:24:27.020 --> 02:24:28.980
[SPEAKER_22]: Go on the one that sinks while it's sinking.

02:24:29.421 --> 02:24:32.481
[SPEAKER_02]: So have sex on the sinking boat at Treasure Island.

02:24:32.601 --> 02:24:33.261
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our answer.

02:24:33.642 --> 02:24:34.682
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you need to have sex.

02:24:35.082 --> 02:24:35.342
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

02:24:36.282 --> 02:24:36.802
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope that helped.

02:24:38.263 --> 02:24:52.146
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Lab asks, Puppy wants to know, based on everyone that we've met on this show, if everyone there in Channel Orange Lounge and the studio were to get into a big fight,

02:24:53.231 --> 02:24:53.531
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever guessed?

02:25:13.823 --> 02:25:16.986
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd probably say that Melody would win.

02:25:17.867 --> 02:25:18.367
[SPEAKER_02]: Which Melody?

02:25:18.407 --> 02:25:19.128
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had two Melodies.

02:25:19.228 --> 02:25:21.710
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Angel Melody and then we had Mel B's girlfriend Melody.

02:25:22.091 --> 02:25:24.233
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that would be Shark Skrull Melody.

02:25:24.253 --> 02:25:25.314
[SPEAKER_22]: Because she's badass.

02:25:25.874 --> 02:25:26.515
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I think she's badass.

02:25:26.575 --> 02:25:27.296
[SPEAKER_20]: Of us, I would win.

02:25:32.114 --> 02:25:34.056
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, if the three of us got in a fight, you mean you would win?

02:25:34.076 --> 02:25:35.898
[SPEAKER_22]: All I have to do is kick both of you in the balls.

02:25:36.759 --> 02:25:37.780
[SPEAKER_02]: We could kick you in the boob.

02:25:38.461 --> 02:25:39.221
[SPEAKER_22]: You've got two of them.

02:25:39.722 --> 02:25:40.483
[SPEAKER_03]: One foot each.

02:25:40.683 --> 02:25:41.684
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you know what?

02:25:41.724 --> 02:25:43.245
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys see that coming here right away.

02:25:43.265 --> 02:25:45.548
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's just like a big target.

02:25:45.808 --> 02:25:46.428
[SPEAKER_03]: Hit me here.

02:25:46.449 --> 02:25:48.390
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're expecting that, okay?

02:25:49.271 --> 02:25:51.433
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll smack you both in my purse if I have the time.

02:26:08.727 --> 02:26:10.548
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyone who's ever been in the chatroom, Clint.

02:26:12.409 --> 02:26:12.910
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:15.011
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that would be the lose.

02:26:15.251 --> 02:26:16.091
[SPEAKER_02]: Shine lose right there.

02:26:17.012 --> 02:26:19.633
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the folks in there right now, you know what?

02:26:19.833 --> 02:26:21.675
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Chubbs would kick a lot of ass.

02:26:22.215 --> 02:26:24.116
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Chubbs would lay the smack down.

02:26:24.356 --> 02:26:30.960
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would come down all to Chubbs and Mel B. Mel's not in the chat right now, but he's been on the show before.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:32.641
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's where the fight would come down.

02:26:35.129 --> 02:26:36.971
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Wendell would kick some ass, too.

02:26:37.311 --> 02:26:38.933
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, Wendell would kick all kinds of ass.

02:26:39.634 --> 02:26:45.100
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true, but Wendell's never been... Oh, Wendell's been in the segments, on the interview segments, so I guess that counts.

02:26:47.442 --> 02:26:51.867
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, but I think that overall, Jahi would own everybody, just the personality alone.

02:26:52.347 --> 02:26:54.430
[SPEAKER_02]: True, Jahi would yell everybody to death.

02:26:57.513 --> 02:26:58.874
[SPEAKER_22]: He's my great defender anyway.

02:27:01.536 --> 02:27:02.457
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so that's your answer.

02:27:02.477 --> 02:27:03.218
[SPEAKER_02]: That's who'd win a fight.

02:27:04.238 --> 02:27:07.981
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving along here with Ask Orange Lounge.

02:27:08.001 --> 02:27:08.922
[SPEAKER_02]: We're running out of questions.

02:27:08.962 --> 02:27:09.542
[SPEAKER_02]: We need more.

02:27:09.842 --> 02:27:11.023
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, question us.

02:27:11.143 --> 02:27:18.149
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also send us questions over email to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com and we'll answer those live on air as well.

02:27:19.486 --> 02:27:21.948
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember, if you ask a personal question, we don't necessarily have to answer it.

02:27:21.968 --> 02:27:25.029
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you ask a really, really personal question, we may not answer.

02:27:25.369 --> 02:27:27.971
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we'll make something up.

02:27:29.592 --> 02:27:29.892
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

02:27:31.013 --> 02:27:33.454
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, there's an interesting question from Shadow.

02:27:34.295 --> 02:27:35.856
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of personal questions.

02:27:37.016 --> 02:27:41.959
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, what is the best position for giving the chicks the best sexual satisfaction?

02:27:45.321 --> 02:27:46.802
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie continues doing her nails.

02:27:46.822 --> 02:27:47.042
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

02:27:48.757 --> 02:27:51.719
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to answer it, or are you going to tell them to... The mechanical one.

02:27:56.122 --> 02:27:58.303
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically guys are incapable, so give it up.

02:27:59.444 --> 02:27:59.964
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

02:28:01.285 --> 02:28:01.765
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

02:28:01.906 --> 02:28:05.448
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think a guy can pleasure a woman as well as she can figure out how to pleasure herself.

02:28:06.088 --> 02:28:07.109
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, zing!

02:28:08.990 --> 02:28:10.531
[SPEAKER_03]: You would think that, yeah, of course.

02:28:11.392 --> 02:28:11.872
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently...

02:28:18.647 --> 02:28:24.230
[SPEAKER_22]: Except, you know, remember, masturbation and porn are for people who don't get laid.

02:28:24.250 --> 02:28:25.390
[SPEAKER_22]: Porn is just comedy.

02:28:27.251 --> 02:28:29.972
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with you there about porn being comedy.

02:28:29.992 --> 02:28:30.833
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just fun.

02:28:31.433 --> 02:28:35.435
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, why try to inject a plot into something that really means none?

02:28:35.475 --> 02:28:37.176
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I think.

02:28:37.236 --> 02:28:38.796
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's funny.

02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:42.761
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on.

02:28:43.141 --> 02:28:45.422
[SPEAKER_02]: We have another question from EOSFBB.

02:28:46.723 --> 02:28:52.046
[SPEAKER_02]: He has on his list, his list of places he wants to have sex, he says, sex in a confessional, good kinkiness or morally wrong?

02:28:52.887 --> 02:28:53.207
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

02:28:54.167 --> 02:28:56.769
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, they had that contest going on the radio a while back.

02:28:56.849 --> 02:28:59.051
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, Opie and Anthony, remember those kids?

02:28:59.171 --> 02:29:04.074
[SPEAKER_02]: They got kicked off the air for that shit, so we can't really answer that because we don't want to get... Oh, wait, we're on the internet.

02:29:04.114 --> 02:29:05.075
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do whatever the fuck we want.

02:29:06.336 --> 02:29:09.418
[SPEAKER_22]: Go fuck in the changing room that the priests use.

02:29:10.399 --> 02:29:12.261
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, that's better than the confessional.

02:29:12.281 --> 02:29:14.002
[SPEAKER_22]: You might walk in on them with a little boy or something.

02:29:14.062 --> 02:29:14.502
[SPEAKER_22]: Use the pew.

02:29:14.522 --> 02:29:15.123
[SPEAKER_22]: Sex and a pew?

02:29:21.106 --> 02:29:23.027
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be afraid to have sex in a church.

02:29:23.168 --> 02:29:26.569
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the problem with sex in a church is that I wouldn't be able to get it up.

02:29:26.749 --> 02:29:28.951
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be too afraid of, like, lightning hitting me.

02:29:30.992 --> 02:29:31.252
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

02:29:32.573 --> 02:29:34.373
[SPEAKER_02]: We both just hear a blink, blink, blink.

02:29:35.114 --> 02:29:36.194
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, see, that's the thing.

02:29:36.234 --> 02:29:37.755
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you can have sex in a church.

02:29:37.775 --> 02:29:38.856
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you'd be able to get it up.

02:29:38.876 --> 02:29:40.937
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can, hey, you're weird.

02:29:41.357 --> 02:29:41.717
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

02:29:44.199 --> 02:29:46.560
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, uh, Stresa would like to point out he hasn't gotten any...

02:29:49.249 --> 02:29:50.589
[SPEAKER_02]: But have you gotten compliments?

02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:52.630
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the thing.

02:29:53.290 --> 02:29:58.312
[SPEAKER_03]: Women a lot of times, you know, they're not going to see anything because they're afraid that they'll hurt your feelings or something.

02:29:58.432 --> 02:30:01.013
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again, there's those women that are like, you fucking suck.

02:30:01.533 --> 02:30:03.414
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah.

02:30:04.534 --> 02:30:06.574
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, just do this, okay?

02:30:06.594 --> 02:30:08.995
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like she's liking it.

02:30:09.015 --> 02:30:09.935
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep doing what you're doing.

02:30:10.395 --> 02:30:17.616
[SPEAKER_03]: If she doesn't like it, or it doesn't look like she's enjoying herself, I mean, and you should be able to tell, I mean, none of this, like, she's faking shit.

02:30:17.656 --> 02:30:18.776
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you can tell, okay?

02:30:19.477 --> 02:30:20.357
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell if she's liking it.

02:30:20.477 --> 02:30:23.777
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, uh, if something's not working, then try something else.

02:30:24.097 --> 02:30:29.818
[SPEAKER_03]: Just experiment, and you'll eventually find something that, you know, works really good, and just keep doing that.

02:30:29.838 --> 02:30:31.779
[SPEAKER_03]: You can only get better.

02:30:31.799 --> 02:30:33.319
[SPEAKER_22]: This segment has been Loki's Exception.

02:30:34.420 --> 02:30:36.322
[SPEAKER_22]: Sponsored by Folgers Coffee.

02:30:36.722 --> 02:30:39.145
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, stress is sharing that he has gotten a few compliments.

02:30:40.066 --> 02:30:40.306
[SPEAKER_02]: Aww.

02:30:40.326 --> 02:30:40.766
[SPEAKER_02]: Aww, cute.

02:30:40.847 --> 02:30:41.607
[SPEAKER_02]: More questions!

02:30:41.848 --> 02:30:43.169
[SPEAKER_02]: More quite, we were out of questions.

02:30:43.570 --> 02:30:44.931
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys need to send us more questions.

02:30:45.191 --> 02:30:45.752
[SPEAKER_02]: Question us more.

02:30:46.433 --> 02:30:47.734
[SPEAKER_02]: Send us more questions over private message.

02:30:47.754 --> 02:30:51.758
[SPEAKER_02]: You can ask us about something Bomani, that would be okay too, seeing as this is supposed to be a Bomani show.

02:30:52.219 --> 02:30:52.880
[SPEAKER_02]: Heh, heh.

02:30:53.635 --> 02:30:56.337
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and was Under Station a rocky show?

02:30:56.357 --> 02:30:57.598
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, true, very true.

02:30:58.118 --> 02:31:00.359
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, listen to understationlive.org, they're back on the air now.

02:31:00.640 --> 02:31:03.742
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do Bomani stuff, we've got only like one more thing to talk about.

02:31:03.782 --> 02:31:05.143
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, then I have to stop the music.

02:31:07.424 --> 02:31:13.228
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the only other Bomani thing that actually happened this week, the only thing that happened, actually two things.

02:31:13.708 --> 02:31:16.350
[SPEAKER_03]: Internet ranking for DV Extreme came up, yay.

02:31:17.012 --> 02:31:25.956
[SPEAKER_03]: and they found out if you play Paranoia Rebirth and get double A, play Paranoia Evolution and get double A, then you get to play Paranoia Survivor Max in DDR Extreme.

02:31:26.557 --> 02:31:27.357
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about it.

02:31:27.837 --> 02:31:29.418
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, back to the ask questions thing.

02:31:29.538 --> 02:31:30.279
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, ask questions.

02:31:30.299 --> 02:31:30.559
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

02:31:30.579 --> 02:31:31.219
[SPEAKER_02]: We got another question.

02:31:32.960 --> 02:31:34.621
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray for people saving this segment.

02:31:35.941 --> 02:31:38.162
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Lab wants to... Oh, goddammit.

02:31:39.443 --> 02:31:42.384
[SPEAKER_02]: When is someone going to kidnap me and take me to Scandia for 2DX?

02:31:42.945 --> 02:31:44.045
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, soon?

02:31:45.126 --> 02:31:45.366
[SPEAKER_02]: Never.

02:31:46.650 --> 02:31:50.173
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:32:09.112 --> 02:32:12.675
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:32:37.712 --> 02:32:38.492
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, sorry.

02:32:38.852 --> 02:32:39.573
[SPEAKER_02]: What, you cut your finger?

02:32:39.593 --> 02:32:41.513
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you okay?

02:32:42.053 --> 02:32:42.453
[SPEAKER_02]: You okay?

02:32:43.473 --> 02:32:44.354
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, JB's okay.

02:32:45.114 --> 02:32:45.494
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yes.

02:32:47.014 --> 02:32:54.216
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be going, and then I'm going to be coming back on Saturday, so I can swing by Davis and get you on Saturday if you want, and we'll go to Scandia on Sunday.

02:32:54.236 --> 02:32:54.676
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that sound?

02:32:54.696 --> 02:32:56.817
[SPEAKER_22]: I just thought of a guest who can kick everybody's ass.

02:32:56.837 --> 02:32:57.197
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

02:32:57.377 --> 02:32:57.757
[SPEAKER_22]: Shermie.

02:32:58.923 --> 02:33:00.524
[SPEAKER_22]: Shermie has been a guest on the show.

02:33:00.584 --> 02:33:03.825
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think Shermie would claw Chubbs to death, even?

02:33:04.325 --> 02:33:06.306
[SPEAKER_22]: She would out-cute.

02:33:07.287 --> 02:33:07.447
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh!

02:33:07.567 --> 02:33:08.727
[SPEAKER_22]: And then Shermie would kick their ass.

02:33:09.668 --> 02:33:11.489
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, everyone's like, oh, cute.

02:33:11.569 --> 02:33:11.929
[SPEAKER_34]: All right.

02:33:12.749 --> 02:33:14.650
[SPEAKER_22]: Shermie's the cutest guest we've ever had on the show.

02:33:14.670 --> 02:33:15.170
[SPEAKER_22]: And you weren't here.

02:33:15.870 --> 02:33:16.471
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I wasn't here.

02:33:16.491 --> 02:33:16.771
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

02:33:16.951 --> 02:33:20.613
[SPEAKER_22]: Shermie was in the show at my house, and Shermie was like, I'm in the show.

02:33:20.913 --> 02:33:23.094
[SPEAKER_22]: And she purred on the microphone.

02:33:23.134 --> 02:33:24.074
[SPEAKER_22]: She farted on the microphone?

02:33:24.094 --> 02:33:24.614
[SPEAKER_22]: She purred!

02:33:26.375 --> 02:33:26.855
[SPEAKER_22]: My pussy.

02:33:27.976 --> 02:33:28.216
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:33:29.110 --> 02:33:30.572
[SPEAKER_22]: People have met my Shermie.

02:33:30.592 --> 02:33:32.874
[SPEAKER_22]: My baby.

02:33:32.995 --> 02:33:36.098
[SPEAKER_09]: My cat is cute, right?

02:33:36.118 --> 02:33:37.259
[SPEAKER_09]: My cat's cute.

02:33:38.060 --> 02:33:38.361
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

02:33:39.522 --> 02:33:40.003
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving along.

02:33:40.063 --> 02:33:41.204
[SPEAKER_02]: I stress I agree.

02:33:41.224 --> 02:33:42.886
[SPEAKER_02]: Shermie is the cutest pussy he's ever seen.

02:33:43.086 --> 02:33:44.027
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you.

02:33:44.087 --> 02:33:44.328
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

02:33:44.588 --> 02:33:45.209
[SPEAKER_02]: More questions!

02:33:48.023 --> 02:33:48.564
[SPEAKER_02]: 23rd Magus.

02:33:48.764 --> 02:33:50.465
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he's got a Bamani-related question.

02:33:50.505 --> 02:33:50.866
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.

02:33:51.426 --> 02:33:53.128
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the easiest katas?

02:33:53.348 --> 02:33:56.090
[SPEAKER_02]: I have four so far, and I want to get more under my belt.

02:33:56.631 --> 02:33:57.011
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question.

02:33:57.031 --> 02:33:57.431
[SPEAKER_22]: Kakumei.

02:33:57.792 --> 02:33:58.312
[SPEAKER_02]: Kakumei?

02:33:58.352 --> 02:33:58.692
[SPEAKER_22]: I feel.

02:33:59.233 --> 02:34:00.674
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel.

02:34:00.754 --> 02:34:01.515
[SPEAKER_22]: Hypnotic Crisis.

02:34:01.635 --> 02:34:02.375
[SPEAKER_02]: Hypnotic Crisis.

02:34:02.435 --> 02:34:03.036
[SPEAKER_02]: My Summer Love.

02:34:03.957 --> 02:34:04.297
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.

02:34:04.317 --> 02:34:04.897
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.

02:34:05.378 --> 02:34:06.419
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you speed it up.

02:34:06.439 --> 02:34:12.183
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, well, then I'm thinking kind of like 78, Matt.

02:34:12.203 --> 02:34:12.364
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep.

02:34:12.384 --> 02:34:16.427
[SPEAKER_22]: Just about all the ones in Max except for Stay and So Deep, which I'm close to So Deep.

02:34:18.229 --> 02:34:20.752
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say, I think Twilight Zone is really easy.

02:34:20.792 --> 02:34:21.552
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it depends.

02:34:21.993 --> 02:34:24.355
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends if you, because there's two types of people.

02:34:24.796 --> 02:34:27.199
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the people that can get the weird rhythms really easy.

02:34:27.399 --> 02:34:31.844
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're that type of person, you can get Orion 7-8, I feel those kind of cat is no problem.

02:34:32.711 --> 02:34:36.132
[SPEAKER_02]: I have issues with my stamina, partly from my asthma and having a bad knee and a bad ankle.

02:34:55.697 --> 02:34:57.138
[SPEAKER_02]: First CATA you guys ever passed?

02:34:57.498 --> 02:35:00.760
[SPEAKER_02]: Hypnotic Crisis Same here, Hypnotic Crisis What was the first CATA you ever passed, Loki?

02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:06.702
[SPEAKER_03]: First CATA I passed was on doubles and that was Make Your Move Make Your Move Really?

02:35:06.742 --> 02:35:07.502
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a CATA?

02:35:07.743 --> 02:35:10.744
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a CATA Okay, second CATA you guys passed, do you remember?

02:35:11.522 --> 02:35:22.966
[SPEAKER_02]: Gradius Exciter Mine was Orion 7-8 La Senorita Doubles I was better at doubles than I was singles for the longest time What was the first singles category you passed?

02:35:23.027 --> 02:35:36.212
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I remember I think it was Dead End Oh, no, no, no, no, I do remember the easiest one to pass Paranoia Eternal, but with the fifth mix steps were heavy Ah, okay, Paranoia Eternal on fifth mix I know my favorite one Lupin, remember?

02:35:36.732 --> 02:35:39.453
[SPEAKER_02]: Lupin, yeah I don't think Lupin's that easy, though

02:35:40.525 --> 02:35:44.608
[SPEAKER_22]: We're at the party at one of our old Bitmoney parties back at the old group.

02:35:44.688 --> 02:35:48.891
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, we're so old school that every cat is easy now.

02:35:48.911 --> 02:35:49.752
[SPEAKER_22]: On a modded home pad.

02:35:50.172 --> 02:35:51.973
[SPEAKER_22]: Went back a couple days later.

02:35:52.934 --> 02:35:56.376
[SPEAKER_22]: That was actually right before the NGL 2.

02:35:57.317 --> 02:36:00.419
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the hardest cats are the ones that run third mix, actually.

02:36:01.319 --> 02:36:02.060
[SPEAKER_22]: I completely agree.

02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:02.880
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, they upgraded...

02:36:07.892 --> 02:36:12.855
[SPEAKER_22]: The Upgraded Paranoia Clean and End of the Century.

02:36:12.895 --> 02:36:13.615
[SPEAKER_22]: I beat both of those.

02:36:13.976 --> 02:36:14.896
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, the ones they have tonight.

02:36:14.956 --> 02:36:15.857
[SPEAKER_22]: I beat Dead End.

02:36:15.877 --> 02:36:17.237
[SPEAKER_22]: It actually took me a while to beat Dead End.

02:36:17.257 --> 02:36:21.180
[SPEAKER_02]: Broken My Heart Sees You Scatter.

02:36:21.960 --> 02:36:23.021
[SPEAKER_22]: And Burn the Floor.

02:36:23.481 --> 02:36:23.701
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

02:36:23.841 --> 02:36:24.541
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I meant.

02:36:24.561 --> 02:36:25.042
[SPEAKER_02]: Burn the Floor.

02:36:25.062 --> 02:36:25.402
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

02:36:25.862 --> 02:36:26.542
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not really.

02:36:26.582 --> 02:36:28.784
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what it's called.

02:36:28.864 --> 02:36:31.965
[SPEAKER_22]: And I actually did legitimately get Captain Jack on 4K.

02:36:31.985 --> 02:36:32.586
[SPEAKER_02]: Captain Jack's cool.

02:36:33.366 --> 02:36:34.627
[SPEAKER_22]: And you remember how long I was working on this?

02:36:34.647 --> 02:36:35.107
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I remember.

02:36:35.127 --> 02:36:45.913
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the very... Because I passed every single kata, like, I was in that phase when 4th was still... No, when 5th... 5th was... That's kind of when I was... When 5th was kind of new.

02:36:46.273 --> 02:36:49.575
[SPEAKER_02]: And Captain Jack was the very last kata I was able to do, which is kind of weird.

02:36:50.235 --> 02:36:51.376
[SPEAKER_02]: Because most people pass it easy.

02:36:51.436 --> 02:36:53.237
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it was a pain in the ass for me for some reason.

02:36:53.697 --> 02:36:55.178
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of those, I beat first time.

02:36:55.858 --> 02:37:01.200
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, although one I still to this day can't do because my knee always goes out of the same part on this as Exotic Ethnic.

02:37:01.980 --> 02:37:03.981
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's one of the harder ones.

02:37:04.961 --> 02:37:05.761
[SPEAKER_22]: You've seen it happen.

02:37:06.021 --> 02:37:07.962
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll do Exotic Ethnic and then I'll go down.

02:37:08.422 --> 02:37:09.402
[SPEAKER_22]: Literally, I will fall.

02:37:10.063 --> 02:37:10.563
[SPEAKER_22]: You've seen it.

02:37:10.743 --> 02:37:11.063
[SPEAKER_02]: Go down.

02:37:12.983 --> 02:37:14.244
[SPEAKER_22]: You've seen me fall on this one.

02:37:14.924 --> 02:37:21.570
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do have good stamina though, Wenda is actually not a bad one I don't know because I never kept track of that shit, I just peed everything

02:37:42.860 --> 02:37:43.621
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're so late.

02:37:44.022 --> 02:37:49.128
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I mean... Yeah.

02:37:49.148 --> 02:37:52.212
[SPEAKER_22]: My first seven, though, was Let Them Move.

02:37:52.232 --> 02:37:53.013
[SPEAKER_10]: What was Dead End?

02:37:53.293 --> 02:37:54.415
[SPEAKER_10]: Dead End's a nine.

02:37:54.475 --> 02:37:56.077
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay, because I beat that late.

02:37:58.547 --> 02:37:59.548
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of people did, though.

02:37:59.568 --> 02:38:02.149
[SPEAKER_22]: It was harder for me, but I think it was against my own age.

02:38:03.370 --> 02:38:09.313
[SPEAKER_22]: I, um, one of the ones that I was really amazed I could get was Breakdown, though, because of the speed.

02:38:09.934 --> 02:38:12.735
[SPEAKER_34]: Another real easy one would be, uh, Pernod, A Clean Mix.

02:38:13.055 --> 02:38:13.316
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

02:38:13.696 --> 02:38:17.858
[SPEAKER_22]: But I remember when that was just an 8.

02:38:18.178 --> 02:38:18.999
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, I feel it.

02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:21.100
[SPEAKER_22]: I feel so easy.

02:38:21.981 --> 02:38:22.721
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on.

02:38:22.741 --> 02:38:23.682
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people complained about it.

02:38:23.722 --> 02:38:25.803
[SPEAKER_22]: It actually does follow the pattern.

02:38:27.304 --> 02:38:27.564
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

02:38:29.153 --> 02:38:38.259
[SPEAKER_02]: EOSFBB, if I were to have Vid Powah star in a porno in which he fucks chick on a DDR pad, what would be a good song to choreograph this freestyle of all freestyles to?

02:38:38.279 --> 02:38:42.621
[SPEAKER_02]: Bomani related, yes, he does know about this, we are currently trying to cast a female.

02:38:43.622 --> 02:38:44.162
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck.

02:38:46.084 --> 02:38:47.344
[SPEAKER_20]: After the Game of Love.

02:38:47.504 --> 02:38:50.546
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, After the Game of Love, definitely, or any erotic song.

02:38:51.327 --> 02:38:52.167
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Secret Rendezvous.

02:38:53.048 --> 02:38:53.608
[SPEAKER_02]: What mix?

02:38:53.848 --> 02:38:54.729
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to know what mix.

02:38:56.423 --> 02:38:59.789
[SPEAKER_22]: If they're going to do a porn, they fuck on the DDR pad, but they should be in the background.

02:39:09.688 --> 02:39:13.890
[SPEAKER_03]: Say, I would like to hear... D-Level.

02:39:13.910 --> 02:39:16.591
[SPEAKER_23]: D-Level would be pretty good, but I was thinking Orion.

02:39:17.812 --> 02:39:18.932
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Boom Boom Dollar?

02:39:18.992 --> 02:39:20.653
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he could, you know, rest on the rhythm.

02:39:20.693 --> 02:39:21.833
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom, boom, boom.

02:39:22.193 --> 02:39:25.155
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he could, like, be lip-syncing to Mighty Fine Dollar.

02:39:25.635 --> 02:39:26.835
[SPEAKER_22]: No, Pink Dinosaur.

02:39:27.095 --> 02:39:28.016
[SPEAKER_22]: Because it's about a penis.

02:39:29.685 --> 02:39:30.906
[SPEAKER_03]: or, um, no, no, Walkie Talkie.

02:39:31.786 --> 02:39:36.629
[SPEAKER_03]: Just have, okay, have multiple music, multiple different songs for each different scene.

02:39:36.649 --> 02:39:38.710
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna have Blow My Whistle Bitch for the oral game.

02:39:38.730 --> 02:39:40.711
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Blow My Whistle, well, this is the thing, this is the thing.

02:39:40.731 --> 02:39:41.932
[SPEAKER_02]: EOSFBB gave me the mix.

02:39:41.952 --> 02:39:45.334
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gonna try to close game land and do it and use DDR EX.

02:39:45.774 --> 02:39:47.475
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't do Blow My Whistle Bitch, that's not in the EX.

02:39:49.357 --> 02:39:54.403
[SPEAKER_15]: All I can say is I'm not going to do a hand clap on that machine ever again.

02:39:54.743 --> 02:39:57.466
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, go ahead, shoot a porno here.

02:39:58.688 --> 02:39:59.789
[SPEAKER_02]: He might be friends with the owner.

02:40:01.691 --> 02:40:03.373
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you think he's going to let us shoot a porno?

02:40:04.695 --> 02:40:05.075
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

02:40:06.397 --> 02:40:07.058
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, maybe not.

02:40:07.919 --> 02:40:09.300
[SPEAKER_22]: India's Family Entertainment.

02:40:10.881 --> 02:40:11.822
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, next question.

02:40:12.142 --> 02:40:12.983
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, next question.

02:40:13.303 --> 02:40:14.984
[SPEAKER_02]: We gave you plenty of good songs to choose from.

02:40:15.004 --> 02:40:15.545
[SPEAKER_02]: Pick one.

02:40:15.865 --> 02:40:16.705
[SPEAKER_02]: I still say Butterfly.

02:40:17.406 --> 02:40:19.788
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

02:40:20.048 --> 02:40:22.069
[SPEAKER_02]: Stressa says, I was playing AM radio today.

02:40:22.109 --> 02:40:23.270
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit a 200 combo.

02:40:23.290 --> 02:40:25.652
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear to God, this blue thing kind of reminded me of Tickman.

02:40:25.672 --> 02:40:26.732
[SPEAKER_02]: The Tick, whatever his name is.

02:40:26.813 --> 02:40:29.354
[SPEAKER_02]: Jump out from the right side of the screen and screeched at me.

02:40:29.394 --> 02:40:30.195
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck was that?

02:40:30.655 --> 02:40:32.737
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that something standard to an Oni course?

02:40:33.692 --> 02:40:36.956
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's a thing, it's a joke from Mortal Kombat.

02:40:37.097 --> 02:40:48.051
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes toasty, yeah, toasty, and it's just, it's a thing that's built into step media when you get, I think it's 150 perfects in a row or something like that.

02:40:48.852 --> 02:40:50.373
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it, it happens all the time.

02:40:50.393 --> 02:40:54.917
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, uh, actually, you have the new, you have different skins you can get.

02:40:55.037 --> 02:40:58.760
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine right now is, uh, Casento, which is the blue thing that you were talking about.

02:40:59.001 --> 02:41:07.067
[SPEAKER_03]: They also have, they have one with, uh, with Virtu, uh, wearing the DDR, uh, pad, and the, the helmet.

02:41:07.968 --> 02:41:08.889
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hilarious.

02:41:09.469 --> 02:41:13.873
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's part of the new DDR, that's the, uh, SM Extreme skin for that one.

02:41:14.233 --> 02:41:15.414
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, it's pretty funny.

02:41:15.494 --> 02:41:17.456
[SPEAKER_03]: You still need to have an Orange Lounge skin for Steppenwolf.

02:41:19.122 --> 02:41:20.342
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't look at me, I'm not making one.

02:41:20.382 --> 02:41:20.742
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

02:41:21.142 --> 02:41:22.503
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuz, I'm lazy and I don't... Why not?

02:41:22.523 --> 02:41:22.863
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on!

02:41:22.883 --> 02:41:23.683
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do stands.

02:41:23.723 --> 02:41:27.804
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true, I can't even finish... I can't even finish my One-Step Mania file I tried to make.

02:41:27.844 --> 02:41:28.484
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, shit, man!

02:41:29.244 --> 02:41:30.604
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna finish it and call it mine.

02:41:30.984 --> 02:41:31.765
[SPEAKER_03]: No, bastard.

02:41:33.605 --> 02:41:37.426
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so... Insertion.

02:41:37.546 --> 02:41:38.046
[SPEAKER_34]: Insertion?

02:41:38.626 --> 02:41:39.046
[SPEAKER_34]: What about it?

02:41:40.166 --> 02:41:45.187
[SPEAKER_03]: XTC, yeah, but Insertion, I think... Every time I listen to Insertion, I'm thinking it's boring.

02:41:45.227 --> 02:41:47.608
[SPEAKER_03]: It just sounds like boring music, it's got like... A lot of bass.

02:41:49.199 --> 02:41:52.180
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone would send me the goddamn file.

02:41:52.200 --> 02:41:52.560
[SPEAKER_03]: I have it.

02:42:18.695 --> 02:42:19.936
[SPEAKER_22]: and you better copy that for me.

02:42:20.717 --> 02:42:21.778
[SPEAKER_22]: DCC me that later.

02:42:22.018 --> 02:42:25.741
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I'll DCC it to Jamie and we play it on fuck-offs occasionally.

02:42:25.781 --> 02:42:26.502
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that good enough?

02:42:26.923 --> 02:42:28.644
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't shit we do here good enough for you?

02:42:28.704 --> 02:42:29.145
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.

02:42:31.046 --> 02:42:33.368
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the part where Brad's supposed to go, where?

02:42:34.770 --> 02:42:35.470
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll think about it.

02:42:38.365 --> 02:42:39.206
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no more questions.

02:42:39.226 --> 02:42:39.886
[SPEAKER_02]: We're out of questions.

02:42:41.548 --> 02:42:42.348
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a question, Jamie?

02:42:42.569 --> 02:42:43.710
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to ask Orange Law something?

02:42:43.950 --> 02:42:44.730
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to ask a question.

02:42:44.770 --> 02:42:45.271
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a question.

02:42:45.371 --> 02:42:45.691
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you want to?

[SPEAKER_02]: I like this.

[SPEAKER_02]: All right, fine.

02:42:49.014 --> 02:42:51.416
[SPEAKER_02]: When they don't ask us questions, we're going to ask them questions.

02:42:51.436 --> 02:42:52.817
[SPEAKER_22]: Why won't you ask us another question?

02:42:54.679 --> 02:42:57.021
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, I think you're going to ask him something good.

02:42:57.081 --> 02:43:00.804
[SPEAKER_22]: I want you to send me some nice yaoi.

02:43:02.017 --> 02:43:04.538
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, where should they email that to?

02:43:04.598 --> 02:43:09.399
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura at idealo.com Alright, here we go, more questions.

02:43:09.419 --> 02:43:12.720
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that wasn't a question.

02:43:13.660 --> 02:43:14.740
[SPEAKER_02]: Stressa says he still loves us.

02:43:15.021 --> 02:43:17.621
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, he better.

[SPEAKER_02]: Black Lab wants to know when they're going to see some hot monkey sex on the show.

02:43:26.424 --> 02:43:27.184
[SPEAKER_20]: Where's the ferret?

02:43:28.430 --> 02:43:29.370
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where the ferret is.

02:43:29.750 --> 02:43:30.671
[SPEAKER_22]: Where's the ferret?

02:43:30.871 --> 02:43:31.991
[SPEAKER_02]: Did somebody kidnap the ferret?

02:43:34.411 --> 02:43:35.112
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the ferret?

02:43:37.012 --> 02:43:38.272
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, the ferret's gone.

02:43:38.792 --> 02:43:39.413
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it up here?

02:43:40.253 --> 02:43:41.073
[SPEAKER_22]: You have a Furby.

02:43:41.673 --> 02:43:42.633
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know I have a Furby.

02:43:44.034 --> 02:43:45.954
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where the ferret went.

02:43:45.994 --> 02:43:46.854
[SPEAKER_02]: The ferret is missing.

02:43:47.855 --> 02:43:51.035

02:43:52.036 --> 02:43:54.336
[SPEAKER_02]: When will we have hot monkey sex on this show?

02:43:57.057 --> 02:43:57.677
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what we can do.

02:44:00.214 --> 02:44:02.596
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll go to the zoo and try to take some sex.

02:44:02.636 --> 02:44:04.698
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, we saw the orangutans.

02:44:04.738 --> 02:44:06.139

02:44:06.159 --> 02:44:07.580
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and I saw turtles fucking, too.

02:44:08.001 --> 02:44:09.262
[SPEAKER_02]: You saw turtles fucking?

02:44:09.302 --> 02:44:12.224
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, Julie and I went for a school assignment, and we saw turtles fucking.

02:44:12.424 --> 02:44:12.965
[SPEAKER_02]: How was that?

02:44:13.565 --> 02:44:14.226
[SPEAKER_22]: Slow.

02:44:14.826 --> 02:44:21.852
[SPEAKER_21]: It was really neat to see the male turtle standing up, leaning on the shell of the female turtle, go, vroom, vroom.

02:44:25.144 --> 02:44:26.724
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he make a vump sound when he did it?

02:44:26.924 --> 02:44:29.305
[SPEAKER_22]: No, but it was like that slow.

02:44:29.425 --> 02:44:36.366
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like... One... Two... It was... No, it was turtle fucking.

02:44:36.386 --> 02:44:40.707

[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, stress out!

02:44:47.229 --> 02:44:48.329
[SPEAKER_22]: I saw the lemurs doing it.

02:44:50.621 --> 02:44:51.462
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a question.

02:44:52.362 --> 02:44:52.823
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an order.

02:44:53.823 --> 02:44:54.024
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

02:44:54.064 --> 02:44:55.204

[SPEAKER_02]: No.

02:44:58.527 --> 02:45:00.248
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan won't be here.

02:45:00.368 --> 02:45:06.532
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the ferret.

02:45:06.672 --> 02:45:09.414
[SPEAKER_02]: 23rd Magus wants to know, are y'all happy for us?

02:45:10.275 --> 02:45:11.516
[SPEAKER_02]: So happy we could shit.

02:45:12.516 --> 02:45:14.478
[SPEAKER_02]: And is he getting too sappy today?

02:45:17.043 --> 02:45:18.864
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he getting too sappy, you guys think?

02:45:19.845 --> 02:45:20.026
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

02:45:20.246 --> 02:45:22.008
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to tease you guys, because we can.

02:45:23.069 --> 02:45:24.390
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't find the other yo-yo either.

02:45:24.630 --> 02:45:27.413
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

02:45:29.575 --> 02:45:30.857
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, all the toys disappeared.

02:45:30.917 --> 02:45:31.938
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there's the yo-yo, I see it.

02:45:32.058 --> 02:45:32.478
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the ground.

02:45:32.959 --> 02:45:33.339
[SPEAKER_02]: It's over there.

02:45:34.120 --> 02:45:34.380
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

02:45:35.361 --> 02:45:38.605
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take a quick break, and we're going to come back and wrap up this train wreck of a show.

02:45:39.325 --> 02:45:39.786
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back.

02:45:42.719 --> 02:45:43.560
[SPEAKER_02]: Take us to break, Jamie.

02:45:43.740 --> 02:45:44.201
[SPEAKER_18]: Yo-yo.

02:45:46.163 --> 02:45:46.844
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a rapper?

02:45:46.924 --> 02:45:47.485
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo-yo-yo?

[SPEAKER_18]: Try to play me out.

02:45:50.648 --> 02:45:51.129
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back.

02:47:18.624 --> 02:47:28.676
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, let's be you, every night

Thanks for watching!

02:52:01.134 --> 02:52:01.714
VOG Network!

02:52:01.754 --> 02:52:01.894

02:52:28.456 --> 02:52:35.297

[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, ass!

02:53:24.773 --> 02:53:27.457
[SPEAKER_01]: This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

02:53:31.141 --> 02:53:33.604
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:53:35.046 --> 02:53:36.828
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki wanted to talk about how he's going to be famous.

02:53:39.077 --> 02:53:39.697
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, which is Mike.

02:53:39.717 --> 02:53:42.659
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not going to be famous, but it was cool.

02:53:42.759 --> 02:53:48.681
[SPEAKER_03]: This weekend we went down to Scandia to actually be interviewed by someone for their school paper.

02:53:48.701 --> 02:53:49.782
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was fun.

02:53:50.082 --> 02:53:51.123
[SPEAKER_03]: And she listens to the show.

02:53:52.183 --> 02:53:53.264
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool!

02:53:53.504 --> 02:53:54.224
[SPEAKER_03]: We have fans.

02:53:54.684 --> 02:53:55.425
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

02:53:56.025 --> 02:53:57.706
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know that actually someone listens to our show.

02:53:58.786 --> 02:53:59.066
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.

02:53:59.466 --> 02:54:08.571
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the song, by the way, that we played, the last song before we came back was Dancer, which, by the way, is the best 2DX8 style video ever.

02:54:09.032 --> 02:54:17.216
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were talking during the break about, because some of you out there have been demanding that we update our website with our bios because they haven't been up for a while.

02:54:17.996 --> 02:54:19.617
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki has never had a bio on the site.

02:54:20.418 --> 02:54:20.898
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry.

02:54:21.078 --> 02:54:23.780
[SPEAKER_22]: I need a picture of me with my real nose and not a Photoshop nose.

02:54:24.560 --> 02:54:27.622
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to admit, though, Glenn did interesting work with those.

02:54:27.702 --> 02:54:28.122
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

02:54:29.014 --> 02:54:30.756
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't look anything like myself.

02:54:30.836 --> 02:54:33.098
[SPEAKER_22]: Excuse me, I don't look like I'm made out of plastic.

02:54:33.738 --> 02:54:35.500
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they did look like we were made out of plastic.

02:54:35.560 --> 02:54:36.941
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't have a Barbra Streisand nose.

02:54:37.522 --> 02:54:38.362
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a big nose too, hey.

02:54:38.923 --> 02:54:44.147
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyway, we're going to take some new pictures of ourselves and we're talking about which 2DX videos we're going to parody to do the pictures of.

02:54:44.167 --> 02:54:45.489
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to parody a 2DX video.

02:54:45.709 --> 02:54:46.830
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't play 2DX.

02:54:46.950 --> 02:54:49.392
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're just going to dress you up like a pimp because you're the porn king.

02:54:49.772 --> 02:54:50.713
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a porn king.

02:54:50.733 --> 02:54:51.594
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't even own that much.

02:54:51.614 --> 02:54:52.314
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up, you're the porn king.

02:54:54.376 --> 02:54:54.996
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, chat room.

02:54:55.497 --> 02:54:55.937
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat room.

02:54:56.277 --> 02:54:57.077
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we dressing?

02:54:57.157 --> 02:54:58.298
[SPEAKER_02]: I want chat room to vote then.

02:54:58.338 --> 02:55:00.798
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we dressing up Loki for his picture on the bio page?

02:55:01.499 --> 02:55:05.240
[SPEAKER_02]: We already decided Jamie's going to do the dancer scary Barbie chick girl.

02:55:06.120 --> 02:55:06.721
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be funny.

02:55:07.861 --> 02:55:09.382
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be a cowgirl.

02:55:10.882 --> 02:55:12.303
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll shave your head in odd ways.

02:55:12.323 --> 02:55:14.323
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to set your hair on fire and take a picture.

02:55:16.084 --> 02:55:17.745
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're not setting my hair on fire.

02:55:17.925 --> 02:55:19.886
[SPEAKER_03]: I could wear my trench coat and my glasses out.

02:55:19.926 --> 02:55:20.346
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

02:55:20.386 --> 02:55:21.086
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

02:55:21.542 --> 02:55:21.822
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:55:21.842 --> 02:55:23.583
[SPEAKER_22]: That would actually be from a 2DX video.

02:55:23.763 --> 02:55:25.303
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, ah, beautiful, beautiful.

02:55:25.543 --> 02:55:26.523
[SPEAKER_02]: Snub, Dysphenoid, got it.

02:55:26.663 --> 02:55:26.983
[SPEAKER_02]: Stoic.

02:55:27.864 --> 02:55:29.004
[SPEAKER_02]: We're dressing up like the Stoic video.

02:55:29.024 --> 02:55:29.244
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

02:55:29.464 --> 02:55:29.804
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:55:29.984 --> 02:55:30.324
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

02:55:30.404 --> 02:55:31.405
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be our tag.

02:55:31.425 --> 02:55:31.665
[SPEAKER_02]: Winner.

02:55:31.745 --> 02:55:32.225
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, guys.

02:55:32.585 --> 02:55:32.825
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:55:32.865 --> 02:55:35.566
[SPEAKER_22]: But don't be offended if I don't drool over you.

02:55:35.586 --> 02:55:36.066
[SPEAKER_02]: Stoic it is.

02:55:36.106 --> 02:55:36.486
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

02:55:37.266 --> 02:55:39.907
[SPEAKER_22]: But we need to actually Photoshop in a Tran next to him.

02:55:40.007 --> 02:55:40.287
[SPEAKER_02]: We will.

02:55:41.427 --> 02:55:44.792
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm going to dress up as the chick from the last message video.

02:55:45.573 --> 02:55:48.476
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only fitting since I sit on the ground all the time.

02:55:48.496 --> 02:55:50.459
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so just sit on the ground all the time.

02:55:50.499 --> 02:55:52.461
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I get to be the girlfriend dancer.

02:55:52.481 --> 02:55:53.462
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to bring in a Barbie.

02:55:54.323 --> 02:55:55.425
[SPEAKER_22]: One of my gothed out Barbies.

02:55:57.694 --> 02:55:58.375
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

02:56:19.458 --> 02:56:33.333
[SPEAKER_22]: I had this weird phase I went through where I was buying Barbies because I... Alright, when I was in third grade I let all my Barbies mold and then I just went off and played with my Transformers and then suddenly I realized that the Barbies that came out for a little while were actually kind of cool except I wanted to alter them.

02:56:36.153 --> 02:56:36.893
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I did.

02:56:37.513 --> 02:56:37.914
[SPEAKER_02]: Into what?

02:56:38.334 --> 02:56:39.434
[SPEAKER_22]: I would actually make their clothes.

02:56:40.034 --> 02:56:40.374
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's cool.

02:56:40.394 --> 02:56:42.155
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm a little fashion designer.

02:56:42.215 --> 02:56:43.455
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to want to be a fashion designer.

02:56:43.475 --> 02:56:44.616
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you fashion design for G.I.

02:56:44.636 --> 02:56:45.036
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe, too?

02:56:45.056 --> 02:56:45.836
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he needed it.

02:56:46.616 --> 02:56:47.676
[SPEAKER_22]: No, because you know what?

02:56:47.696 --> 02:56:48.917
[SPEAKER_22]: They never came out with the G.I.

02:56:48.937 --> 02:56:49.597
[SPEAKER_22]: Joe that had hair.

02:56:50.157 --> 02:56:50.677
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's true.

02:56:51.218 --> 02:56:52.678
[SPEAKER_22]: I wanted Earring Magic Ken, though.

02:56:52.698 --> 02:56:54.899
[SPEAKER_22]: Because Earring Magic Ken came with a cock ring.

02:56:57.019 --> 02:56:57.579
[SPEAKER_22]: Seriously.

02:56:58.040 --> 02:57:02.741
[SPEAKER_22]: And the guy admitted that when he designed them, that the pendant he wore around his neck really was a cock ring.

02:57:05.225 --> 02:57:06.146
[SPEAKER_22]: And they took it off the market.

02:57:06.206 --> 02:57:06.486
[SPEAKER_22]: Dot, dot, dot.

02:57:06.606 --> 02:57:11.649
[SPEAKER_22]: I bet if you look up eBay and look up Earring Magic Ken, then they're going to be bugs.

02:57:12.430 --> 02:57:13.010
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

02:57:13.390 --> 02:57:13.510
Yeah.

02:57:13.871 --> 02:57:14.211
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:57:14.231 --> 02:57:14.911
[SPEAKER_22]: A little known fact.

02:57:15.872 --> 02:57:17.073
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

02:57:17.993 --> 02:57:21.356
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, well, we're going to get around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night.

02:57:21.796 --> 02:57:24.598
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, I want to say, we didn't even talk about this on the show tonight.

02:57:24.658 --> 02:57:26.099
[SPEAKER_02]: It's completely Vimani-related.

02:57:26.199 --> 02:57:28.000
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge topic that came up this week.

02:57:28.220 --> 02:57:30.021
[SPEAKER_02]: We totally forgot to talk about it.

02:57:30.281 --> 02:57:31.182
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about it next week.

02:57:31.842 --> 02:57:33.984
[SPEAKER_02]: Max 2 is announced for the USA.

02:57:35.365 --> 02:57:36.106
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:57:54.620 --> 02:57:55.361
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, you know what?

02:57:55.782 --> 02:57:58.046
[SPEAKER_02]: We should play instruments live on the show.

02:57:58.066 --> 02:57:59.708
[SPEAKER_02]: You should bring in a sax and I can bring in my clarinet.

02:57:59.748 --> 02:58:00.369
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one.

02:58:00.790 --> 02:58:01.050
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

02:58:01.070 --> 02:58:01.751
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a clarinet anyway.

02:58:01.771 --> 02:58:03.775
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe if I got my own mouthpiece or something.

02:58:03.855 --> 02:58:06.098
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just bring in a skin flute for you to play, Rob.

02:58:10.043 --> 02:58:11.064
[SPEAKER_22]: Only 99 cents a minute, don't you know, child?

02:58:11.084 --> 02:58:11.744
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all in the cards.

02:58:40.165 --> 02:58:41.426
[SPEAKER_22]: Why are you looking at me when you say that?

02:58:41.506 --> 02:58:41.866
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

02:58:42.907 --> 02:58:43.427
[SPEAKER_02]: You're sexy.

02:58:43.467 --> 02:58:45.669
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss Cleo loves the Jamie.

02:58:46.449 --> 02:58:49.731
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss Cleo likes the big black cock.

02:58:49.751 --> 02:58:51.933
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss Cleo wants to shove this turban up your ass.

02:58:52.913 --> 02:58:55.976
[SPEAKER_22]: Miss Cleo likes the big black cock.

02:58:56.056 --> 02:58:59.598
[SPEAKER_22]: She has a big black cock going out of her head and she keeps it wrapped up in the turban.

02:59:00.609 --> 02:59:02.390
[SPEAKER_22]: She actually has Voldemort on the back of her head.

02:59:02.570 --> 02:59:03.650
[SPEAKER_02]: Dot, dot, dot.

02:59:04.131 --> 02:59:07.432
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go around and give everybody's final thoughts.

02:59:07.952 --> 02:59:10.073
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting with our guest, Brad, your final thought for the day.

02:59:10.093 --> 02:59:10.553
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a ninja.

02:59:10.814 --> 02:59:11.394
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a ninja.

02:59:11.594 --> 02:59:11.934
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

02:59:12.374 --> 02:59:14.575
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, or Loki, your final thoughts for the day.

02:59:15.075 --> 02:59:15.816
[SPEAKER_02]: I like FLCL.

02:59:15.836 --> 02:59:22.439
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on!

02:59:22.959 --> 02:59:28.961
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is that Stapler X is saying Sky's Voice the game is going to be released in July of 2003, and that scares me!

02:59:29.662 --> 02:59:29.742
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

02:59:31.022 --> 02:59:33.123
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, the truck have started to move.

02:59:33.664 --> 02:59:35.245
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's my final thought of the day.

02:59:35.325 --> 02:59:36.966
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, the truck have started to move.

02:59:39.047 --> 02:59:41.389
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that Square is top shape in all the world.

02:59:43.050 --> 02:59:44.550
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night everybody, thanks for listening.

02:59:44.731 --> 02:59:46.011
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, actually... Eat children!

02:59:46.572 --> 02:59:48.053
[SPEAKER_02]: One more quick thing.

02:59:48.873 --> 02:59:53.476
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually Jamie is the person behind, the mastermind behind the fortune cookie message of the day.

02:59:53.496 --> 02:59:54.997
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I was going to play the Eggo and Company.

02:59:55.365 --> 03:00:00.027
[SPEAKER_02]: However, tonight I decided I'm going to interrupt and put in a special fortune cookie message.

03:00:00.928 --> 03:00:03.149
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit kind of sentimental.

03:00:03.429 --> 03:00:10.772
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a dedication because there's somebody out there that really, when I was a child, indeed anyway.

03:00:10.792 --> 03:00:12.333
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you guys laughing at?

03:00:12.373 --> 03:00:13.733
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to have a serious moment here.

03:00:13.753 --> 03:00:14.434
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys suck.

03:00:15.154 --> 03:00:17.055
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are playing Candy King.

03:00:17.595 --> 03:00:21.617
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say, no, seriously, this is a dedication to Fortune Cookie Message.

03:00:21.677 --> 03:00:27.840
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was a young child, there was somebody I was definitely inspired by that I used to watch every week.

03:00:27.900 --> 03:00:29.921
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the first shows that I watched all the time.

03:00:29.941 --> 03:00:30.542
[SPEAKER_02]: I am crying.

03:00:30.802 --> 03:00:36.605
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was definitely influenced by this person and part of the reason that I think I like to entertain.

03:00:37.065 --> 03:00:38.966
[SPEAKER_02]: So, kind of a serious Fortune Cookie Night.

03:00:39.646 --> 03:00:40.427
[SPEAKER_02]: Caning Rob.

03:00:40.707 --> 03:00:41.768
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very sad.

03:00:42.109 --> 03:00:45.872
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely had a big... I had a big cry this week.

03:00:48.334 --> 03:00:48.915
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Rob.

03:00:48.955 --> 03:00:49.936
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys always ruin it.

03:00:50.116 --> 03:00:50.576
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright.

03:00:50.876 --> 03:00:52.258
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night, you guys.

03:00:52.998 --> 03:00:53.519
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night, you guys.

03:00:53.539 --> 03:00:54.520
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next week.

03:00:55.976 --> 03:00:58.959
[SPEAKER_31]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:00:59.520 --> 03:01:02.843
