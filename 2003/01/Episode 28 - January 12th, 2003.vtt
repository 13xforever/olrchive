WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
What, uh, what should we expect from your routine today? Is it a big secret? No? Can you give us any details before you go?

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
One word. Shades.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
Message for you, son!

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
Attention!

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Do you want to hear the most annoying fan in the world?

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

00:26.000 --> 00:36.000
Orange Lounge may contain adult content, Orange Lounge may contain many 4-letter words.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity. Orange Lounge may contain hot-monkey sex.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot-monkey sex.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
In this episode...

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
What's your favorite scary movie?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Showgirls.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Absolutely frightening.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
What's yours?

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
There are no stupid questions.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Just stupid people.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Don't torture yourself.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
That's my job.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Now's the time on sprockets and we dogs.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
I'll get you my pretty and your little dog too.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
For no good food.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
I'm sorry but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Why did they have to take the word game?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
No!

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
No!

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
No!

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
No!

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
No!

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
No!

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
No!

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
No!

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
No!

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
No!

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
No!

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
No!

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
No!

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
No! Nobody expects us, finally takes the position.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
It's kendo.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Hey!

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Dark Sakurai.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Shut up!

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Where's my gun?

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
This is my boomstick.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Sky.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Loki.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
What kind of working and being would find that funny?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.880
We are live!

01:49.880 --> 01:54.120
And this is episode number 28 for January the 12th of 2003

01:54.120 --> 02:01.120
You're tuned into the BEES!

02:01.400 --> 02:04.620
Manisine's most shade-sy radio station of all things

02:04.620 --> 02:09.660
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky. Joining me, as always, are my

02:09.660 --> 02:10.320
awesome

02:10.320 --> 02:14.480
co-hosts, well one's invisible at the second. He isn't here yet. That would be

02:14.480 --> 02:15.020
Loki

02:15.020 --> 02:16.900
within your yet

02:16.900 --> 02:20.620
the others right here and she's she's perky as always right

02:20.620 --> 02:26.700
i'm wanting to do this particular show and michael jack

02:26.700 --> 02:31.500
say hello to dark chakra

02:31.500 --> 02:33.580
and some of these at the door

02:33.580 --> 02:35.980
did you bring hot man sex with you

02:35.980 --> 02:39.660
yes hot man sex is a bad person ok we'll get to that later

02:39.660 --> 02:43.680
uh... this episode of the twenty-eight will be doing the fremont

02:43.680 --> 02:47.680
attorney wrap-up, and you'll have to excuse us in advance. We're all a little out of it today.

02:47.680 --> 02:51.680
Two of us have had headaches, one of us has been coughing, and one of us is late!

02:51.680 --> 02:55.680
Say hello to Loki, there he is. Does that mean I'm having a baby?

02:55.680 --> 02:59.680
Only if your water

02:59.680 --> 03:03.680
breaks, I don't know. We're just really freaking tired after yesterday.

03:03.680 --> 03:07.680
I'm feeling better, though. I was in a really pissy mood,

03:07.680 --> 03:11.680
but I saw destruction on the way here, so I was happy.

03:11.680 --> 03:18.680
always fun.

03:41.680 --> 03:47.600
only $1.99 and actually what's kind of funny is this says that this is a baby

03:47.600 --> 03:53.720
coyote now to my knowledge coyotes do not look like ferrets I don't understand

03:53.720 --> 04:01.040
how this is a coyote or whatever at that um that long so we went to the yes the

04:01.040 --> 04:09.280
fuck my diet at the Walgreens at the longs that we went to in Fremont they had

04:09.280 --> 04:11.800
gigantic ones of these. I almost got one.

04:11.800 --> 04:16.880
And don't forget, yesterday there was a horse, and we'll hear about that in the interviews

04:16.880 --> 04:18.560
a little later. Oh, what, you mean Hot Man Sex?

04:18.560 --> 04:23.300
No, not Hot Man Sex, the actual horse that Corey had that was, you know, made for a man

04:23.300 --> 04:28.120
but pH balanced for a woman type thing. Yeah.

04:28.120 --> 04:31.300
Anyway, yeah, it's going to be one of those shows. Darkticity summed it up right there.

04:31.300 --> 04:38.040
Happy 24th, by the way. Where's my donut?

04:38.040 --> 04:43.040
Let's say hello to Maureen's studio guests before we get to the first break.

04:48.040 --> 04:53.040
Wow, there's chaos going on here. I feel like I'm in the middle of Gumby's routine. Jesus.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.040
Say hello to Brad.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.040
Another step has entered the game.

04:58.040 --> 05:00.040
Say hello to Irene.

05:00.040 --> 05:01.040
Hi guys!

05:01.040 --> 05:04.040
And Dave is over there too. Dave, say hi.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.040
Hi.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.040
Dave, you look like a monk.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.040
You know it, baby.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.040
All right, baby.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.040
All right.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.040
We better go to break right now.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.040
Now's a good time.

05:11.040 --> 05:16.520
Let's do a break with some, we'll do a break with some songs from Extreme, because Extreme

05:16.520 --> 05:19.840
is spreading across the country like a bad case of herpes.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.520
It's extremely extreme.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.000
Soon to be in your neighborhood.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.960
Yeah, Rob spread it.

05:24.960 --> 05:28.240
Hi guys, you're listening to Orange Jones Radio.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.240
you

07:28.240 --> 07:30.240
Oh

07:58.240 --> 08:00.240
I don't want to lose you

08:00.240 --> 08:02.240
And I don't want to lose you

08:02.240 --> 08:04.240
I don't want to lose you

08:04.240 --> 08:11.240
Here's one of my favorite tracks.

08:34.240 --> 08:41.240
by request, this is V, the Xtreme Edit.

10:04.240 --> 10:24.560
Hi everybody, this is DSCS.

10:24.560 --> 10:28.520
Make sure to visit SoCalKicks.com and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

10:28.520 --> 10:32.940
We finally accomplished ultimate evolution just now.

10:32.940 --> 10:34.700
And then you make the horses have sex.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.460
Oh, wait, are we live?

10:36.460 --> 10:38.340
Yes, I just turned the mics on.

10:38.340 --> 10:40.340
And then you make the horses have sex.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.300
You pick your horses and they breed.

10:42.300 --> 10:43.300
They go off into the distance.

10:43.300 --> 10:44.640
You breed the horses for real?

10:44.640 --> 10:48.000
They go off into the distance and there's a dramatic fade out.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.980
And I see you see the mommy horse and the baby horse.

10:50.980 --> 10:53.600
And the baby horse goes, hi, I'm the baby horse.

10:53.600 --> 10:54.880
You get to name me.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.780
So I named my hot man sex.

10:56.780 --> 10:57.780
All right.

10:57.780 --> 10:59.100
Mommy, where do baby horses come from?

10:59.100 --> 11:02.020
Yeah, we're talking about Derby Owners Club.

11:02.020 --> 11:03.020
Virtual horses.

11:03.020 --> 11:04.020
I'll own you.

11:04.020 --> 11:05.020
That game is crack.

11:05.020 --> 11:06.020
Breathe.

11:06.020 --> 11:07.020
Um, I'm...

11:07.020 --> 11:08.020
My horse is...

11:08.020 --> 11:11.020
And then I name mine Takumi, and uh, yeah.

11:11.020 --> 11:13.020
No, you don't have any horses.

11:13.020 --> 11:14.020
I know, I just...

11:14.020 --> 11:15.020
But then, but then you train your horses...

11:15.020 --> 11:17.020
I thought that Ryosuke could own Takumi easily.

11:17.020 --> 11:19.020
You train your horsies, and then...

11:19.020 --> 11:20.020
It's like that code.

11:20.020 --> 11:24.540
And then you make them run around, and then you drown them, like Matt did.

11:24.540 --> 11:28.260
I drowned my horse three times, and I was being mean.

11:28.260 --> 11:30.020
For those that are completely lost right now...

11:30.020 --> 11:31.020
My horse likes bananas.

11:31.020 --> 11:35.940
talking about a new game, a somewhat new game, called Derby Owners Club. Now this game, it's

11:35.940 --> 11:43.820
worse than DDR. It is a bigger drug than DDR ever is. It's kind of like, it's kind of like

11:43.820 --> 11:52.320
DDR is like, DDR is kind of like, I don't know, like, DDR is kind of like pot, and Derby

11:52.320 --> 11:58.320
Owners Club is kind of like just straight up smack. Because like, the straight up smack

11:58.320 --> 12:03.620
is way more expensive, and there's not as much to it, you know, you just kind of take

12:03.620 --> 12:09.640
the smack, you know, you don't have to worry about...anyway, the point I'm trying to make,

12:09.640 --> 12:14.800
what the hell is Derby Owners Club? It's like these big, just giant seizure buttons you

12:14.800 --> 12:21.760
use to beat your horse, and you throw $2.50 into the machine each time, and you just beat

12:21.760 --> 12:28.120
them and you bond with them. That's all Derby Owners Club is. And yet, I find myself strangely

12:28.120 --> 12:33.120
We're going to tell everybody our horses, but mine are last. Rob, what's your horse's name?

12:33.120 --> 12:38.120
My horses are out on the car still, I believe. Or, I don't know, but my horses, I have Miss Thang, which I made in Irvine.

12:38.120 --> 12:43.120
And then I have Beaver Fever, which I made last night in Milpitas.

12:43.120 --> 12:48.120
Okay, I've got BJ, the horse I made in Irvine.

12:48.120 --> 12:53.120
I have Cloud, the horse I jacked from the little girl in Irvine.

12:53.120 --> 13:00.120
And then I have the two horses I made in Milpitas last night. We have Big Black Cock and Mr. Spanky.

13:00.120 --> 13:05.120
And Mr. Spanky's being an ass, so I beat the shit out of him.

13:05.120 --> 13:09.120
He wanted the coconut, but he wasn't good enough, so I gave him the hay.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.120
So that's it.

13:11.120 --> 13:18.120
We're being corrected in the chat room. Derby Owners Club at Milpitas Golf Line actually costs $2.25 a game. Sorry, Milton!

13:18.120 --> 13:21.120
Not that you're making any horse, then it's three.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.580
haha

13:22.580 --> 13:27.180
uh-huh

13:27.180 --> 13:28.920
it being a quarter of peace

13:28.920 --> 13:29.800
yeah anyway

13:29.800 --> 13:33.640
anyway my life it's expensive anyway

13:33.640 --> 13:36.840
i have my first sources of Slytherin chaser is all black and he's really

13:36.840 --> 13:39.380
he's a naughty horse

13:39.380 --> 13:40.700
then my next horse

13:40.700 --> 13:43.160
uh... by the way Slytherin chaser likes oranges

13:43.160 --> 13:46.240
and then my next horse is i like cheese

13:46.240 --> 13:49.320
and then next one is hot man sex

13:49.320 --> 13:52.320
That was my best horse. I won third place with that one.

13:52.320 --> 13:55.320
Then my next horse is Mmm Fajitas.

13:55.320 --> 14:00.320
And my fifth horse is Jin Kazama.

14:00.320 --> 14:04.320
So you spent like thirty dollars on this game or something?

14:04.320 --> 14:05.320
Twelve.

14:05.320 --> 14:09.320
Twelve? Wow, wait. You had like five cards though.

14:09.320 --> 14:13.320
That's three dollars times five is fifteen.

14:13.320 --> 14:18.320
I had two of my games paid for and then Matt lent me money.

14:18.320 --> 14:19.320
Thank you.

14:19.320 --> 14:22.320
Oh great, now you have other people buying you drugs.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.320
That's when you know you're addicted.

14:25.320 --> 14:27.320
Pretty soon you're going to be going to meetings.

14:27.320 --> 14:28.320
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.320
Excuse me.

14:30.320 --> 14:33.320
Anyway, well, Jamie has left the building.

14:33.320 --> 14:34.320
Oh, and I get the chair.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.320
Let's just go around the room and talk about our week.

14:36.320 --> 14:38.320
Because we don't really have any structured Orange Islands Radio.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.320
I know we've got a lot of new people joining us tonight.

14:40.320 --> 14:42.320
They're tuning into here tonight's Fremont interviews.

14:42.320 --> 14:46.120
interviews, and we will get to those in just a sec, but welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

14:46.120 --> 14:52.760
We're Bee-mani Talk Radio, we talk about DDR2DX, Big Black Cocks, masturbating with cake mix,

14:52.760 --> 14:58.580
and all sorts of various random things, basically, that have nothing to do with each other. No,

14:58.580 --> 15:03.340
we try to talk about Bemani, but obviously, if we were able to actually talk three hours

15:03.340 --> 15:07.480
every week about Bemani, we are in really sad shape and have no life, so things get

15:07.480 --> 15:12.000
really random on this program, so enjoy the randomness, and come into our chat room.

15:12.000 --> 15:23.360
makes the ratings go up. Yes, and randomness makes ratings go up. Go to our website, orangelounge.skie.cx

15:23.360 --> 15:27.400
and join in the chat because our chat room is insane. And play nice in the chat tonight,

15:27.400 --> 15:32.720
kids. Play nice. Or we'll beat you. Or we'll whip you just like Mr. Spanky. We'll whip

15:32.720 --> 15:39.720
be like a pony

15:40.440 --> 15:41.920
we have ecstasy

15:41.920 --> 15:45.400
without robs dr ads from the ecstasy cigarettes from two weeks ago show when

15:45.400 --> 15:47.880
the official lesbians were lost in the house

15:47.880 --> 15:49.480
with a dang

15:49.480 --> 15:53.600
about two weeks ago it's nice to meet you guys and make you horny

15:53.600 --> 15:56.040
anyway those things have catnip in it is not cool

15:56.040 --> 15:58.320
they have to have to know i'm not a cat

15:58.320 --> 15:59.320
I'm allergic to snacks.

15:59.320 --> 16:00.320
Damiana makes you horny.

16:00.320 --> 16:01.880
Hey, you know what we oughta do?

16:01.880 --> 16:04.960
Let's all go run out and smoke an ecstasy cigarette and come back and do the show and

16:04.960 --> 16:07.960
see what happens.

16:07.960 --> 16:18.640
It smells like my mom's lasagna or something.

16:18.640 --> 16:19.640
You are a dick.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.920
These are yummy donuts.

16:21.920 --> 16:24.440
Smells like old antique store.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.440
It does.

16:26.440 --> 16:27.440
Ew.

16:27.440 --> 16:36.440
The ingredients are Damiana, Wild Lettuce, Catnip, Passion Flower, Mint, Love, and Light

16:36.440 --> 16:37.440
What's that?

16:37.440 --> 16:40.440
And uh, manufactured by X-Men Z Incorporated.

16:40.440 --> 16:41.440
What is love?

16:41.440 --> 16:42.440
Baby don't hurt me.

16:42.440 --> 16:43.440
In Beverly Hills.

16:43.440 --> 16:44.440
Don't hurt me no more.

16:44.440 --> 16:45.440
And these are made by hippies.

16:45.440 --> 16:48.440
Let's have some, some um, crack.

16:48.440 --> 16:54.520
If I try out these cigarettes and I get horny, is anybody gonna help me out here?

16:54.520 --> 16:56.600
Don't look at me, look at Irene.

16:56.600 --> 17:00.120
She's not in here.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.440
Don't look at me like that Brad, you're scaring me.

17:02.440 --> 17:03.440
Joke.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.440
Ew.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.980
I thought I left the insects in the other room.

17:06.980 --> 17:09.960
OK, so anybody else want to talk about their week,

17:09.960 --> 17:11.460
something that happened this week?

17:11.460 --> 17:12.560
Yes, Dave.

17:12.560 --> 17:13.360
Dave.

17:13.360 --> 17:15.640
I have finals next week, and it is crap.

17:15.640 --> 17:16.840
Ha ha.

17:16.840 --> 17:19.000
And I was like, mom, let me go to the show.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.400
She's like, no, you have to study.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.760
And I was like, dad, let me go to the show.

17:21.760 --> 17:24.000
And he's like, OK, but you have to study later.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.960
So my dad is cool.

17:25.960 --> 17:29.320
But when I get home, I have to study for an hour and a half.

17:29.320 --> 17:32.520
Study means open the book.

17:32.520 --> 17:33.520
And have it in the music.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.520
comic book that's really inside the book.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.520
No, no, no, not that. Just open the book, stare into it blankly.

17:38.520 --> 17:43.520
I'm just going to listen to Orange Lounge and just be like, hey, it's music.

17:43.520 --> 17:48.520
And then I kind of wake up later and be like, yeah, I've been studying the whole time.

17:48.520 --> 17:52.520
In high school, I didn't study, and look where it got me.

17:52.520 --> 17:55.520
That's exactly why I am.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.520
That's exactly the reason I am studying.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.520
Why are you dressed like a monk?

17:59.520 --> 18:00.520
Because I'm wearing...

18:00.520 --> 18:02.520
I know it's not because you want to remain virginal for the rest of your life.

18:02.520 --> 18:08.240
life wait wait wait look look look what I'm wearing oh what's that say it says

18:08.240 --> 18:19.280
boo-boo oh I'm black now no no no no no I I have the big black cock now what is

18:19.280 --> 18:29.320
this the Jewish boo-boo is that no jubu we will offend everyone you know that's

18:29.320 --> 18:32.200
funny because there was a guy yesterday at Fremont that did a routine his name

18:32.200 --> 18:36.120
was the Jew, made me think of you. That's not a good thing.

18:36.120 --> 18:41.980
Well, Rob, I feel touched right here. I have to say, this guy did some very original

18:41.980 --> 18:46.260
things. I have to commend that guy for having the balls to do what he did on that machine.

18:46.260 --> 18:51.580
Very homoerotic original things. I bet when you watch the video, when you watch

18:51.580 --> 18:54.940
the video, you're going to notice I'm the only one laughing at that routine.

18:54.940 --> 18:58.700
Okay, keep in mind, keep in mind everybody had balls there yesterday.

18:58.700 --> 19:02.940
yes for everybody at balls but this guy had really big balls to be doing back

19:02.940 --> 19:06.700
stuff on everybody else to a normal day at a big black cock to go with them can

19:06.700 --> 19:07.980
you show us rob

19:07.980 --> 19:09.300
shows what he did

19:09.300 --> 19:12.940
i'm stopping uh... u s bb ask an excellent question which relates to last

19:12.940 --> 19:16.060
week's discussion did he with his cock out at the end of routine is i was

19:16.060 --> 19:17.080
saying last week

19:17.080 --> 19:19.740
nobody's done that yet and somebody needs to

19:19.740 --> 19:21.620
and be the ultimate thing

19:21.620 --> 19:26.300
no he did not with his car contracts are some people but i did almost a hit i did

19:26.300 --> 19:32.040
almost get hit with his shirt. I had to kind of pick it off the table with my pen that

19:32.040 --> 19:42.040
I was judging with. Speaking of shirts, you had a Twinkie yesterday. Ah, fuck. Ok, Nikkari,

19:42.040 --> 19:49.960
if you're listening, you a bitch. No, seriously, Nikkari's great. He's a good guy. I like him

19:49.960 --> 19:54.520
a lot. But I get to the tournament and I think I'm hot shit because Jamie and I, we ordered

19:54.520 --> 19:58.800
shirts from the Engrish store, and I have my shirt that says, I hate myself and I want

19:58.800 --> 20:01.200
to die, with the little rainbows and the stars.

20:01.200 --> 20:05.920
I get there, I'm walking in, I'm wearing the shirt, and Jamie does this way better.

20:05.920 --> 20:07.520
What's the first thing Nikkari does?

20:07.520 --> 20:15.560
He runs out the door, he can't say it, he goes, oh no you didn't.

20:15.560 --> 20:21.120
And pretty soon, here are Nikkari and I, and those of me out there that happen to know

20:21.120 --> 20:25.100
me a little better than just the radio, and no Nikkari, know that Nikkari and I have something

20:25.100 --> 20:28.840
in common that a lot of D.R. people don't have in common.

20:28.840 --> 20:34.840
So it's just kind of, it made it a lot funnier that, hey, we happen to be wearing the same

20:34.840 --> 20:35.840
shirt.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.520
Too bad that exhibition didn't happen.

20:37.520 --> 20:40.560
Yeah, we were supposed to do an exhibition P.A., but it didn't happen because he had

20:40.560 --> 20:44.520
to go to work and I had to go get batteries to do the tape stuff.

20:44.520 --> 20:46.280
Was Nikkari the Jew guy or was that different?

20:46.280 --> 20:47.280
No, no, no, no.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.600
No, no, completely different guy.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.320
Now what did you rate that guy?

20:50.320 --> 20:52.140
Did you give them like a 100?

20:52.140 --> 20:56.480
I'm not allowed to reveal how I rated people, but if you want to see the judges' towers,

20:56.480 --> 20:57.740
you can look at the results.

20:57.740 --> 20:59.740
They're linked with the DDR3 thing.

20:59.740 --> 21:05.360
I don't want to know about the judges' towers.

21:05.360 --> 21:13.040
I don't need to know this, I'm an innocent, pure-hearted, oh fuck.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.760
You're having to resort to Barry Propel.

21:14.760 --> 21:17.720
You've got to tell, because the listeners that listen to Orange Lawn's radio know about

21:17.720 --> 21:22.560
your love obsession with propel and yesterday what did you find next door to the tournament

21:22.560 --> 21:29.480
berry flavored propel has been um dethroned as my favorite flavor of propel they have

21:29.480 --> 21:35.480
peach flavor propelled because everyone knows i can drink a peach for hours actually i don't

21:35.480 --> 21:40.980
remember what line that movie came from that i can eat that would be face off that's dan's

21:40.980 --> 21:46.960
favorite movie which he actually broke by stepping on the laser disc so um but yeah

21:46.960 --> 21:50.320
Yeah, he says that all the time with our Animal Crossing town, because we have peaches. But

21:50.320 --> 21:59.320
I can drink peaches now. And look at Dan, seductively, go, I'm drinking a peach. Who?

21:59.320 --> 22:03.240
Shut up. Okay. We're going to get to those Fremont interviews

22:03.240 --> 22:06.960
in just a second here, but I wanted to have a serious moment here at the beginning of

22:06.960 --> 22:12.000
the show. No, I want to have a serious moment here, because people died this week, and it

22:12.000 --> 22:15.800
kind of sucks uh... one of the bt's passed away today

22:15.800 --> 22:20.960
uh... maurice maurice hits i believe was the bt that has to wait a long

22:20.960 --> 22:23.960
okay i don't even know the difference between on it

22:23.960 --> 22:27.360
i have a saturday night beaver soundtrack thank you have two copies on

22:27.360 --> 22:28.380
final

22:28.380 --> 22:29.680
i like to be

22:29.680 --> 22:32.600
i don't think it is a noble drop

22:32.600 --> 22:33.840
besides um...

22:33.840 --> 22:35.520
being a band

22:35.520 --> 22:40.160
have no idea what the bt's are so maybe you could enlighten me

22:40.160 --> 22:41.160
i'm too young

22:41.160 --> 22:44.340
they did that song stand alive

22:44.340 --> 22:48.640
uh... you are such a baby

22:48.640 --> 22:54.720
uh... that's it i'm gonna bring you a beat of the best of the bgcd do it

22:54.720 --> 22:58.380
that's right that's right david shit you know i find it very funny that this is a

22:58.380 --> 23:01.880
very serious thing i was looking at your yahoo thing

23:01.880 --> 23:04.900
and i see how you have movies stars and

23:04.900 --> 23:06.060
all this

23:06.060 --> 23:08.640
and and mike

23:08.640 --> 23:09.640
Excuse me.

23:09.640 --> 23:10.640
How unladylike.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.640
Congratulations.

23:11.640 --> 23:22.360
And my yahoo, that one tasted like my dinner, and my yahoo has like world events, and when

23:22.360 --> 23:26.600
the next Harry Potter movie is supposed to come out, important things, yeah, it has my

23:26.600 --> 23:31.240
horoscope, it has my comics, but it has world events, important things that are going to

23:31.240 --> 23:37.480
affect my children's children's children when the magnetic layer decides to erode and everybody

23:37.480 --> 23:38.480
dies.

23:38.480 --> 23:42.980
But your children shouldn't be having kids. I mean, they're so young and they shouldn't have sex.

23:42.980 --> 23:44.980
I don't even have them yet!

23:44.980 --> 23:45.980
I don't want children-

23:45.980 --> 23:46.980
Ew! Fetal sex!

23:46.980 --> 23:48.980
Ew!

23:48.980 --> 23:52.980
No, I don't want children because they'll play with my toys.

23:52.980 --> 23:58.980
It doesn't matter. You have to understand that the world has really nothing to fear because all the world's problems can be solved with nuclear weapons.

23:58.980 --> 24:02.480
I mean, that's what we've learned from the movie The Core that's going to be coming out later on.

24:02.480 --> 24:09.480
We learned, oh hey, if the Earth's pole stops rotating, and I honestly didn't realize that the core of the Earth was rotating,

24:09.480 --> 24:13.480
I guess it is, so the movie said so, it must be true, so...

24:13.480 --> 24:16.480
Hey, are you drunk, Matt? Your face is really red.

24:16.480 --> 24:17.480
No.

24:17.480 --> 24:19.480
He's not Asian, so pay for space to be red like that.

24:19.480 --> 24:21.480
He's so excited, and he just can't hide it.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.480
He's about to lose control and he thinks he likes it.

24:26.480 --> 24:27.480
I'm just so excited.

24:27.480 --> 24:29.480
What is this, the gas episode? Jesus.

24:29.480 --> 24:30.480
Where?

24:30.480 --> 24:37.880
Also, no, also seriously, another famous celebrity that died this week that's very, very sad.

24:37.880 --> 24:38.880
Roxette?

24:38.880 --> 24:39.880
No.

24:39.880 --> 24:40.880
Damn it.

24:40.880 --> 24:41.880
No, no.

24:41.880 --> 24:42.880
She has cancer, but she's not dying yet.

24:42.880 --> 24:43.880
No, this is bigger than that.

24:43.880 --> 24:44.880
This is bigger than that.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.080
Oolong the bunny died, ladies and gentlemen.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.320
Oh my God!

24:48.320 --> 24:50.520
Oolong the bunny, the bunny that balances-

24:50.520 --> 24:52.260
Oh, it's JWTF!

24:52.260 --> 24:56.560
The bunny that balances shit on its head.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.560
I mean, Oolong was a pig, by the way.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.560
In Dragon Ball.

25:00.560 --> 25:03.560
Okay, now you even got me on that one. I think I'm too young for that one, too.

25:03.560 --> 25:09.560
It's an internet joke. Maybe somebody would be so kind to post the link to Oolong the Bunny so I can show some folks the pictures here.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.560
I want to see the pictures of the dead bunny with all the little bunnies.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.560
No, that's horrible!

25:13.560 --> 25:15.560
I want to see it! I want to see it!

25:15.560 --> 25:16.560
You're horrible! You're a horrible woman!

25:16.560 --> 25:18.560
I want to see it! See, see, see!

25:18.560 --> 25:22.560
Hopefully somebody in the chat room knows what I'm talking about when I talk about Oolong the Bunny.

25:22.560 --> 25:25.560
Ah, bunnies just arrived at the cotton ball shoved up its ass.

25:25.560 --> 25:26.560
My God!

25:26.560 --> 25:34.520
You two know that you're the most popular host on this show in the chat room.

25:34.520 --> 25:37.720
You know, that's from, I actually have a quote from a movie, that was from the movie Table

25:37.720 --> 25:43.000
One I was talking about, a really shitty movie about these guys who wanted to open this restaurant

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
lounge.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.440
Doesn't anyone understand that restaurant lounges don't survive?

25:46.440 --> 25:49.600
In the movie, it didn't survive, so they turned it into a strip club, and that's why the movie

25:49.600 --> 25:50.600
rocks.

25:50.600 --> 25:55.320
This guy's going to talk about movies all night long, he's just like, so, yeah, um.

25:55.320 --> 25:59.320
The president died and, oh man, this movie I saw the other night sucks, man.

25:59.320 --> 26:02.320
Anybody? Come on.

26:02.320 --> 26:07.320
And also, another thing that died was this segment.

26:07.320 --> 26:11.320
And Charlie's Angels 2 is gonna suck ass. Duh.

26:11.320 --> 26:13.320
The first one sucked ass. Why? Okay.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.320
Okay, here's the trailer, okay?

26:15.320 --> 26:20.320
They're on this bridge in this Russian, like, cargo truck thingy.

26:20.320 --> 26:23.320
And there's a tank on one side, and a guy with an RPG on the other side.

26:23.320 --> 26:29.320
So what they do, they're going to drive the truck off the freaking damn rocket-propelled grenade.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.320
Dragon Warrior?

26:31.320 --> 26:34.320
I can tell you why the second Charlie's Angels movie is going to suck.

26:34.320 --> 26:36.320
Demi Moore's in it. Her career is over.

26:36.320 --> 26:39.320
She belongs on the surreal life right now.

26:39.320 --> 26:44.320
And they also took out, um, freaking, um...

26:44.320 --> 26:46.320
What's his name?

26:46.320 --> 26:47.320
The comedian?

26:47.320 --> 26:48.320
Bill Murray.

26:48.320 --> 26:51.320
Bill Murray's not in it, so that's why it's going to suck.

26:51.320 --> 26:57.200
bernie mac is pretty funny

26:57.200 --> 26:58.760
i don't know man

26:58.760 --> 27:01.280
well it doesn't matter he doesn't really have a major part of the movie anyways

27:01.280 --> 27:02.840
dave would know this uh...

27:02.840 --> 27:04.640
don't be a menace

27:04.640 --> 27:06.640
while drinking your juice or whatever

27:06.640 --> 27:08.280
what? wasn't he a menace?

27:08.280 --> 27:12.880

27:12.880 --> 27:16.880

27:16.880 --> 27:19.500

27:19.500 --> 27:32.260
I've been given some lovely advanced MP3s from Cory the Sultan.

27:32.260 --> 27:34.900
Cory the Sultan has given us some MP3s.

27:34.900 --> 27:36.140
World premieres here right here.

27:36.140 --> 27:37.780
You're not going to be able to hear them.

27:37.780 --> 27:39.060
Can't download them.

27:39.060 --> 27:40.060
Can't hear them anywhere else.

27:40.060 --> 27:41.060
We've got them.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.660
We're going to play them in this next break.

27:42.660 --> 27:45.780
But I wanted to ask you guys that have played Extreme now this week.

27:45.780 --> 27:46.780
It's been out for a week.

27:46.780 --> 27:48.780
What do you guys think of Extreme?

27:48.780 --> 28:03.780
Well, you know, I really, really, really, really liked it at first, and now I'm like kind of, eh, it's cool and all, but I'm getting bored pretty fast, and that's bad. Bad that I'm losing interest this fast, and, you know, and we haven't even gotten ours yet, and I'm like, eh, whatever.

28:03.780 --> 28:08.780
Rosalind doesn't count, fuckers!

28:33.780 --> 28:36.780
Well, the game itself didn't suck, because I could...

28:36.780 --> 28:39.780
It seems a hell of a lot easier to PA stuff, because I was...

28:39.780 --> 28:43.780
Let him finish, we'll get back to this.

28:43.780 --> 28:45.780
It's the pancake, buddy!

28:45.780 --> 28:46.780
Let Black Lab finish.

28:46.780 --> 28:49.780
Yes, let me finish! God, people!

28:49.780 --> 28:54.780
Okay, yeah, so I played it, I didn't hear the songs, and I was still double A-ing stuff, because I was...

28:54.780 --> 29:00.780
All I could hear was the Max2 net right, like, 10 feet, or 10 inches away from it, so yeah.

29:00.780 --> 29:02.780
It's easier to re-PA stuff on it.

29:02.780 --> 29:04.780
Yeah.

29:04.780 --> 29:06.780
You wanna know how I feel about Max?

29:06.780 --> 29:07.780
Uh, I mean, sorry.

29:07.780 --> 29:09.780
Extreme? Extreme?

29:09.780 --> 29:10.780
Max 2+.

29:10.780 --> 29:12.780
Jamie's out of nuts.

29:12.780 --> 29:14.780
That's, uh, that's how I feel about it.

29:14.780 --> 29:17.780
Okay, so back to this, what we brought up on the internet here,

29:17.780 --> 29:20.780
I was given a link in the chatroom, thank you very much to yosfbb,

29:20.780 --> 29:25.780
to the We Love Oolong page, which has Oolong the bunny balancing pancakes on its head here in the corner.

29:55.780 --> 29:59.780
Please, can we have a serious moment, please?

30:00.780 --> 30:09.780
Hokkaido, Japan. Oolong, the friend of children, bounds across the snow.

30:10.780 --> 30:12.780
You bitch!

30:15.780 --> 30:18.780
That verb was bumpsy, but very flavored Propel.

30:18.780 --> 30:22.780
Go back YouTube, I'll be serious, I promise.

30:22.780 --> 30:25.780
You'll be serious? You promise. You promise.

30:25.780 --> 30:29.780
Happiness is a Japanese rabbit who rests pancakes on his hand.

30:29.780 --> 30:32.780
Alright.

30:32.780 --> 30:34.780
Oh my god, that's such a cute bunny.

30:34.780 --> 30:39.780
He's a fucking gorgeous bunny and you all are really rude. You are rude people.

30:39.780 --> 30:41.780
I don't know why I let you in my house. Okay.

30:41.780 --> 30:50.780
So did he try to balance, like, say, I don't know, a ten-ton safe on his head, and is that what did him in, you know?

30:50.780 --> 30:53.780
How did he die?

30:53.780 --> 30:55.780
Let's, um...

30:55.780 --> 30:58.780
We're gonna read another one? Hold on, hold on, here's another.

30:58.780 --> 31:02.780
I don't know if I can trust you with reading these. All right, all right, here we go.

31:02.780 --> 31:05.780
Shh! Shh!

31:05.780 --> 31:08.780
Where is murder?

31:08.780 --> 31:15.780
that's not what that's the person who wrote it

31:19.820 --> 31:25.180
with big black

31:25.180 --> 31:28.780
i'm still trying to figure out how this rabbit died it's like it had heart

31:28.780 --> 31:31.220
failure or some shit like that heart failure my ass

31:31.220 --> 31:35.180
it's a cover-up i say he's trying to balance the tenth unsafe on his fucking head

31:35.180 --> 31:37.740
are you saying it faked its own death to sell more albums

31:37.740 --> 31:39.240
yes

31:39.240 --> 31:43.600
it's like the elvis of the burrito like to pop i think hiding when the secret

31:43.600 --> 31:47.720
i'll be waiting for his return logan to block

31:47.720 --> 31:50.100
but the hell

31:50.100 --> 31:53.300
all i think it was an untighted embarrassment we're having to

31:53.300 --> 31:58.000

some brand spanking new EX songs, and when we come back, that Fremont coverage, let me

33:39.980 --> 33:46.980
load up those songs, and we will be right back. You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

33:47.020 --> 33:50.860
Our apologies. We're going to start this off with Graduation. After that, Sync for Extreme

33:50.860 --> 33:52.860
and tears will wrap up this set.

33:52.860 --> 33:54.580
Remember, all brands make a new Xtreme.

33:54.580 --> 34:01.580
we love dead bunnies

37:24.580 --> 37:28.440
I'm a

37:28.440 --> 37:31.440
I'm

37:31.440 --> 37:34.440
I'm

37:34.440 --> 37:37.440
I'm

37:37.440 --> 37:41.440
I'm

37:41.440 --> 37:44.440
I'm

37:44.440 --> 37:48.440
I'm

37:48.440 --> 37:51.440
I'm

38:51.440 --> 39:08.440
Orange Lounge Radio. We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

39:08.440 --> 39:19.440
Um, is that a ferret in your pocket or are you just excited about the show?

39:19.440 --> 39:25.440
It's actually a baby coyote in my pocket.

39:25.440 --> 39:26.440
Whatever.

39:26.440 --> 39:29.440
Don't mind me for a second. You guys have to fill while I get the tape queued up here.

39:29.440 --> 39:32.440
Fill or fill or space. Fill or fill or space.

39:32.440 --> 39:37.440
On the next episode of Dragon Ball Z, Goku gets a real gun shoved up his ass and he lives.

39:37.440 --> 39:38.440
Wow!

39:38.440 --> 39:43.440
And he goes like super duper say at level 28 and kills people.

39:43.440 --> 39:47.440
You know what I don't understand is why they didn't bury the bunny in the pancake on its head.

39:47.440 --> 39:49.440
That would have been funny.

39:49.440 --> 39:51.440
Yeah, but they didn't even put a pancake on its head.

39:51.440 --> 39:53.440
It had an orange on its belly.

39:53.440 --> 39:55.440
So?

39:55.440 --> 39:57.440
Not a pancake on its head.

39:57.440 --> 39:59.440
It's famous for things on its head.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.440
Not its belly.

40:01.440 --> 40:03.440
He has dirt on his head.

40:03.440 --> 40:05.440
He's balancing dirt.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.440
And pushing up the daisies while he's at it.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.440
Well, good for him.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.440
I was a cute bunny, though. I had a sniffle.

40:11.440 --> 40:13.440
See, now you see how mean you all were

40:13.440 --> 40:15.440
while I was trying to read those haikus.

40:15.440 --> 40:20.440
It was hilarious, all those random pictures were pretty funny on that site.

40:20.440 --> 40:25.440
Do your dead bunny thing. We miss you terribly and hate that you are dead.

40:25.440 --> 40:30.440
Oolong died but apparently came out to life in Animal Crossing because your new guy Coco or whatever looks like a dead bunny.

40:32.440 --> 40:37.440
Did somebody leave for Coco to show up? Who left?

40:35.440 --> 40:40.440
Maddie.

40:37.440 --> 40:42.440
Maddie left. That makes me cry.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.440
a webcomic.

40:43.440 --> 40:49.600
Um, FYI, I tried one of those ecstasy cigarette things, and I don't feel at all the least

40:49.600 --> 40:53.440
bit, like, aroused. I just have halitosis now.

40:53.440 --> 40:54.440
I'm glad I can't smell it.

40:54.440 --> 40:58.640
Well, let one of us jerk you off, then you'll feel, then you'll feel aroused. No, in fact,

40:58.640 --> 41:03.080
I feel like I gotta take a fat piss. If anything comes out along with it, then I'll let you

41:03.080 --> 41:04.080
guys know.

41:04.080 --> 41:08.320
I can smell, you walked in and I can smell that cigarette on you.

41:08.320 --> 41:09.320
For the life of God, and all that is holy!

41:09.320 --> 41:12.200
Brad, smoke five of them, see if anything happens.

41:12.200 --> 41:14.200
Eat them!

41:14.200 --> 41:16.200
You could probably eat them, though, safely.

41:16.200 --> 41:18.200
Yeah, except for the filter.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.200
You could open the filter and make tea out of them.

41:20.200 --> 41:22.200
Seriously, you could.

41:22.200 --> 41:27.200
No, SoCalKicks, I did not just volunteer to do that favor for Brad. He has a girlfriend.

41:27.200 --> 41:30.200
Oh, stop it!

41:30.200 --> 41:32.200
Stop it!

41:32.200 --> 41:35.200
I think now is a good time, because we've got a lot of people tuned in.

41:35.200 --> 41:39.200
They want to hear this. This is the Fremont coverage. This is where all of us were at yesterday.

41:39.200 --> 41:41.200
Let go of it!

41:41.200 --> 41:42.200
Oh my lord.

41:42.200 --> 41:45.600
How does it feel to want?

41:45.600 --> 41:49.320
Alright you can want in one hand and shit in the other and see which one fills up first.

41:49.320 --> 41:51.320
Okay here we go with the Fremont tournament coverage.

41:51.320 --> 41:54.240
This is going to get very crazy you guys, I just warn you.

41:54.240 --> 41:55.240
We'll butt in with our comments.

41:55.240 --> 41:58.160
I'm going to leave the mics hot so we might be butting in and out with our comments.

41:58.160 --> 41:59.160
So here we go.

41:59.160 --> 42:00.160
This is us yesterday.

42:00.160 --> 42:01.160
That's just horribly wrong.

42:01.160 --> 42:08.160

You're a Cory fanboy?

43:57.820 --> 43:58.820
Yes, I am.

43:58.820 --> 44:01.820
Did you go, oh my god, it's the Max 300 King?

44:01.820 --> 44:05.820
Yes, I said, oh my god, it's the Max 300 King.

44:05.820 --> 44:10.820
All right, now anything you want to say to our lovely listeners out there on the radio?

44:10.820 --> 44:14.820
Cory actually really sucks, I just pretend like he's really cool so that he'll like me.

44:14.820 --> 44:16.820
Secrets revealed.

44:16.820 --> 44:19.820
Don't worry, everybody does that. No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

44:19.820 --> 44:20.820
Cory's gonna beat me up.

44:20.820 --> 44:28.580
I want to say hello to one of my favorite guests to have on any radio program ever.

44:28.580 --> 44:31.180
Give it up, ladies and gentlemen, it's Jahi.

44:31.180 --> 44:32.180
I love this guy.

44:32.180 --> 44:34.480
He always puts me on the microphone, especially when I'm drunk.

44:34.480 --> 44:35.480
It's really great.

44:35.480 --> 44:36.480
How are you doing?

44:36.480 --> 44:37.480
How are you doing, Ski?

44:37.480 --> 44:38.480
What have you had to drink today?

44:38.480 --> 44:41.460
I'm actually completely sober and I gave up pot smoking as a New Year's resolution.

44:41.460 --> 44:42.460
What the hell happened?

44:42.460 --> 44:43.460
That's not right.

44:43.460 --> 44:47.540
I didn't say I gave up drinking or eating pot, I just said I gave up smoking it.

44:47.540 --> 44:49.260
So having it in the brownies is okay?

44:49.260 --> 44:50.260
Yes.

44:50.260 --> 44:56.820
your friend, rise your friend. All interaction at Jockey, www.mystyle.com. www, what the hell

44:56.820 --> 45:03.380
is wrong with you, dot com. www, I didn't even pay for that dot com. Alright, I'll let

45:03.380 --> 45:12.380
Jamie talk to some folks over here. I have the microphone. Anyway, first interview that

45:12.380 --> 45:18.860
I do, say your name for our listeners. My Hypergirl. And you sure are. So what have

45:18.860 --> 45:23.580
you been doing here at the thing all day with that bit of leather oh well last

45:23.580 --> 45:27.100
year at Fremont one I'd worn a leather vest for routine so this year I'm

45:27.100 --> 45:31.060
continuing the tradition I'm referring to the leather that you've been wrapping

45:31.060 --> 45:35.880
around all the guys here oh that's the leather whip that's just randomly

45:35.880 --> 45:41.280
wrapping it around people so how many victims have you claimed today well

45:41.280 --> 45:49.280
Well, let's see. There's Cory, Nikkari, Nado, um...

45:49.280 --> 45:53.280
I think there were a couple others, but I can't remember right now.

45:53.280 --> 45:56.280
I must have threatened a whole lot of other people with it.

45:56.280 --> 45:59.280
So I'm, are you competing in, you are competing in freestyle today?

45:59.280 --> 46:00.280
Yeah, I am.

46:00.280 --> 46:02.280
Very cool, best of luck.

46:02.280 --> 46:03.280
Thank you.

46:03.280 --> 46:06.280
Do you have any special words for our listeners?

46:06.280 --> 46:12.560
um I'm turning 18 in a month and a half so I will thus lose my jailbait status

46:12.560 --> 46:16.720
by summer should be able to legally buy porn yeah I don't have a gangbang legally

46:16.720 --> 46:27.340
be in porn don't give her ideas it'll basically make my routines legal to watch

46:27.340 --> 46:35.280
yeah it'll be in and download on the internet I did that before I was 18 you

46:35.280 --> 46:38.280
You heard it here first on Orange Lounge.

46:38.280 --> 46:41.080
I'm sorry, did anyone else just hear Jahi in the background scream,

46:41.080 --> 46:42.780
NO MEANS NO!

46:42.780 --> 46:48.280
Yeah, I fucking love Jahi. I love that man. Alright.

46:48.280 --> 46:53.280
We are watching Rob get his ass beaten with a whip.

46:53.280 --> 46:56.280
Thank you sir, may I have another?

46:56.280 --> 47:01.280
This one violent hyper girl was beating me up with her whip. It was cool.

47:01.280 --> 47:03.280
Ah, I see why all the boys like her.

47:03.280 --> 47:09.280
At this point I was sitting inside playing GameCube and I was distracted by that.

47:09.280 --> 47:11.280
All of a sudden I see Aaron...

47:11.280 --> 47:13.280
Did you like the image of me getting beat up?

47:13.280 --> 47:22.280
No, I was horribly horribly scarred by it because I look out the window and see Aaron with her whip and see you sticking your ass out waiting for it.

47:22.280 --> 47:25.280
Hey, could have been worse. Could have been my bear ass, okay?

47:25.280 --> 47:28.280
Twitch.

47:28.280 --> 47:29.280
Moving on.

47:29.280 --> 47:30.280
Interviewing you.

47:30.280 --> 47:32.280
Hi guys, I'm DCB.

47:32.280 --> 47:34.280
And what makes you special?

47:34.280 --> 47:37.280
I'm running the tournament, or at least I was.

47:37.280 --> 47:39.280
You're also being pelted with nuts.

47:39.280 --> 47:41.280
It's raining nuts.

47:41.280 --> 47:42.280
Hallelujah.

47:42.280 --> 47:43.280
It's raining nuts.

47:43.280 --> 47:45.280
Stop throwing nuts in my head!

47:45.280 --> 47:47.280
Don't throw nuts in your head!

47:47.280 --> 47:49.280
Hi! So how's the tournament been so far?

47:49.280 --> 47:51.280
It's been hectic.

47:51.280 --> 47:54.280
Because the wrong directions were given out to very many people.

47:54.280 --> 47:57.280
And so that's probably why there's not a lot of people here today.

47:57.280 --> 48:01.280
Stay tuned for the FUs of the Week. We'll be getting into that later.

48:01.280 --> 48:06.280
Yeah, a fuck you goes to MapQuest, indeed.

48:06.280 --> 48:13.280
Um, by the way, tournament running is not as much fun as it looks, is it?

48:13.280 --> 48:17.280
I thought it would be fun, but it's hectic. It's crazy.

48:17.280 --> 48:20.280
It's hell. But, you think it's all worth it?

48:20.280 --> 48:23.280
In the end, yeah.

48:23.280 --> 48:30.280
So, do you have anything special to say for our listeners?

48:30.280 --> 48:32.280
Hi, guys.

48:32.280 --> 48:40.280
Hi, Dad. I'm in jail. I like it here.

48:40.280 --> 48:46.280
All right. I have another interview here with the one, the only, the infamous, say hello to Kyle Snyder, ladies and gentlemen.

48:46.280 --> 48:47.280
Hello.

48:47.280 --> 48:48.280
How are you doing today?

48:48.280 --> 48:49.280
I'm doing all right.

48:49.280 --> 48:52.280
What brings you to Fremont, sir?

48:52.280 --> 49:01.280
This is my hometown. I'm competing in this tournament to show my greatest, one of my greatest routines ever.

49:01.280 --> 49:06.280
I can't say it's my greatest because flashing tonight is my greatest.

49:06.280 --> 49:13.280
What should we expect from your routine today? Is it a big secret? Can you give us any details before you go?

49:13.280 --> 49:15.280
One word.

49:15.280 --> 49:17.280
Shades.

49:17.280 --> 49:18.280
Shades.

49:18.280 --> 49:20.280
Cryptic.

49:20.280 --> 49:22.280
Gets a reaction from the crowd.

49:22.280 --> 49:24.280
Kyle, is there anything you want to say out there, listeners,

49:24.280 --> 49:27.280
Orange Lawns Radio, Bomani Internet Radio?

49:27.280 --> 49:28.280
I sure would.

49:28.280 --> 49:30.280
To all those that are freestyling,

49:30.280 --> 49:36.280
you are about to see a routine that you possibly have never seen before.

49:36.280 --> 49:39.280
It is a Michael Jackson routine,

49:39.280 --> 49:43.920
And I guarantee you, you are in for a show.

49:43.920 --> 49:45.840
I am moist with anticipation.

49:45.840 --> 49:48.960
How about everybody else?

49:48.960 --> 49:49.960
Good luck out there, Kyle.

49:49.960 --> 49:50.960
All right.

49:50.960 --> 49:51.960
I'll see you soon.

49:51.960 --> 49:53.120
You got many fans out there rooting for you.

49:53.120 --> 49:54.120
Good luck.

49:54.120 --> 49:55.120
All right.

49:55.120 --> 49:57.640
That'd be a pretty cool name.

49:57.640 --> 49:59.640
All right.

49:59.640 --> 50:01.040
We're going to talk to these guys.

50:01.040 --> 50:02.040
You want to talk to these guys, Jamie?

50:02.040 --> 50:03.440
Or you want me to talk to these guys?

50:03.440 --> 50:04.440
All right.

50:04.440 --> 50:05.880
Who is this guy over here in the green?

50:05.880 --> 50:06.880
Okay.

50:06.880 --> 50:10.880
My name is Alex, aka La Saca Puntas for this tournament.

50:10.880 --> 50:13.880
And for all you people that don't speak Spanish, that is the pencil sharpener.

50:13.880 --> 50:15.880
Yes, that's right, I said pencil sharpener.

50:15.880 --> 50:16.880
I thought Punta was whore.

50:16.880 --> 50:18.880
No, that's the Saca Puntas.

50:18.880 --> 50:19.880
Oh, my bad.

50:19.880 --> 50:20.880
Yeah, so it's like the whole other word before it.

50:20.880 --> 50:21.880
Yes, I know, I took Spanish.

50:21.880 --> 50:22.880
So you're not a whore sharpener.

50:22.880 --> 50:23.880
No, I'm not a whore shop.

50:23.880 --> 50:24.880
I'm sorry.

50:24.880 --> 50:25.880
Do I do support it?

50:25.880 --> 50:28.880
No.

50:28.880 --> 50:30.880
Anything you want to say about tourney today?

50:30.880 --> 50:31.880
I don't know, actually.

50:31.880 --> 50:33.880
This is my first time, so I don't know.

50:33.880 --> 50:34.880
Virgin.

50:34.880 --> 50:35.880
Virgin, yes.

50:35.880 --> 50:42.640
Yes, that's right, um, I don't know, I was actually convinced into doing this, so this

50:42.640 --> 50:48.300
is my cultural freestyle, best of luck to you, good to meet you, thank you, you too.

50:48.300 --> 50:52.060
And uh, this is the, one of the co-runners of the tournament here, what's your name,

50:52.060 --> 50:56.680
sir? Pete, AKA Henry. Alright, and uh, what makes you decide to do a tourney here at the

50:56.680 --> 51:03.240
uh, lovely uh, where the hell are we? Funtime Pizza! Uh, I decided to make some money, I

51:03.240 --> 51:04.240
I don't know.

51:04.240 --> 51:05.940
Do you actually make money off a tournament?

51:05.940 --> 51:07.760
That's unheard of for me, but...

51:07.760 --> 51:08.880
Not much, no.

51:08.880 --> 51:09.880
But it's fun.

51:09.880 --> 51:10.880
All right.

51:10.880 --> 51:13.360
Anything in particular you're really looking forward to seeing today?

51:13.360 --> 51:14.360
Kyle Snyder.

51:14.360 --> 51:15.360
Kyle Snyder.

51:15.360 --> 51:16.640
It's the reason why we do this, right?

51:16.640 --> 51:17.640
Yes.

51:17.640 --> 51:18.640
Oh, my God.

51:18.640 --> 51:19.640
Must see him.

51:19.640 --> 51:20.640
He's my hero.

51:20.640 --> 51:21.640
Must see.

51:21.640 --> 51:22.640
Must see.

51:22.640 --> 51:23.640
DDR, ladies and gentlemen.

51:23.640 --> 51:24.640
All right.

51:24.640 --> 51:27.680
I had to ask one more question to DCB while I got him.

51:27.680 --> 51:30.080
What's up with the Kirk Cameron and the milk thing?

51:30.080 --> 51:32.000
Chaos, John.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.740
he ripped it out of his cooking textbook

51:34.740 --> 51:37.440
and i don't know if you just said hi guys and stuck it in my face and it's

51:37.440 --> 51:39.760
kind of caught on ever since

51:39.760 --> 51:40.320
wait a minute

51:40.320 --> 51:44.280
a cooking textbook does that mean he's in home ec

51:44.280 --> 51:46.960
a guy in home ec

51:46.960 --> 51:51.520
i took a home ec in seventh grade and i got a pleasure because i can cook without burning

51:51.520 --> 51:52.920
things

51:52.920 --> 51:54.700
i took home ec in seventh grade

51:54.700 --> 51:58.600
and i fail wait no i didn't see

51:58.600 --> 52:01.400
macaroni is not very hard to make guys bunch of fags

52:01.400 --> 52:03.400
I never took home macaroni, I just took anyway.

52:03.400 --> 52:04.400
You took woodshop, didn't you?

52:04.400 --> 52:06.400
Wait, no, we didn't even make macaroni.

52:06.400 --> 52:07.400
That's too complicated.

52:07.400 --> 52:11.400
I was in the gifted program and I got to take whatever the fuck I wanted.

52:11.400 --> 52:14.400
Wait, no, we didn't make macaroni.

52:14.400 --> 52:15.400
That was too complicated.

52:15.400 --> 52:22.400
We made the little, like, biscuits where you, like, open up the can and then you just kind of put them onto the pan.

52:22.400 --> 52:23.400
They made spam.

52:23.400 --> 52:26.400
No, I'm sorry, maybe the school was a little bit too cheap for spam.

52:26.400 --> 52:27.400
You made treat?

52:27.400 --> 52:33.800
My home ec class, I actually cooked things.

52:33.800 --> 52:38.200
We actually made pancakes from scratch, and I was the only one that could cook them without

52:38.200 --> 52:39.200
burning them.

52:39.200 --> 52:42.600
DCB's telling me that home ec is the cool thing to do at their school.

52:42.600 --> 52:48.960
Well, at my school I just liked it because I got to eat food, and they gave this cool

52:48.960 --> 52:51.480
thing to me.

52:51.480 --> 52:52.920
I like to eat food.

52:52.920 --> 52:56.600
I LIKE FOOD!

52:56.600 --> 53:01.440
than eating faeces. That's funny, because I took it because I don't like to eat food,

53:01.440 --> 53:07.360
you know, I just, oh my god. Okay, EOSFB just summed up high school in one sentence. Fuck,

53:07.360 --> 53:11.920
I thought high school was going to be like Saved by the Bell, but I was wrong and disappointed.

53:11.920 --> 53:15.160
Okay, you want to tell me what I learned in high school? Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. I learned

53:15.160 --> 53:22.000
how to either annoy or avoid people, and that a mole is 6.02 x 10-23. I'm so excited! I'm

53:22.000 --> 53:27.000
I'm so excited! I'm so excited! I'm so scared!

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
Never mind.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
Back to the back of the tape.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
We'll let DCB finish the story now.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
You can't stop time and talk to the camera?

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
You can't stop time and talk to the camera?

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
No, unfortunately not.

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
Aww, back to the story, back to the story.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
That's the joke, if y'all were wondering about inside jokes.

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
Yeah, it's all over my banner, all over my website, yeah.

53:49.000 --> 53:54.480
It's about to die soon though. We need a new mascot for hi guys. He's so dreamy. Oh hell yeah

53:56.040 --> 54:01.760
Right on oh, I didn't ask there's anything else you want to say any other shoutouts you want to give today, or what?

54:01.880 --> 54:03.720
What's up? I?

54:03.720 --> 54:07.480
Want to give a shout out to all my azm peeps all around the world

54:08.120 --> 54:12.440

54:22.120 --> 54:23.280

54:23.280 --> 54:26.400

54:26.400 --> 54:29.640
i don't have my spinners

54:29.640 --> 54:31.600
and i was just destroyed

54:31.600 --> 54:32.440
yes

54:32.440 --> 54:33.560
what's up

54:33.560 --> 54:37.200
i'm just trying to remember what the hell johnnie was screaming about that

54:37.200 --> 54:38.640
he's randomly hear him

54:38.640 --> 54:42.240
i i i threatened to quit the show just like johnny takeover and i think all

54:42.240 --> 54:43.560
three of us were agreement

54:43.560 --> 54:45.480
the job he just needs to do the show

54:45.480 --> 54:48.860
we've given his own show on yours on network at the degree to that

54:48.860 --> 54:52.380
the johnny our way that way that i just come in and we're not even there yet

54:52.380 --> 54:55.120
we're not even there yet

54:55.120 --> 54:56.380
as they do it

54:56.380 --> 54:58.240
i'm good hi guys

54:58.240 --> 55:00.220
could show that there is that very nice

55:00.220 --> 55:01.200
thank you

55:01.200 --> 55:02.960
you know

55:02.960 --> 55:04.040
that's all right

55:04.040 --> 55:05.360
i don't know how that

55:05.360 --> 55:09.220
I got off the machine and said, I'm not even supposed to be here today. What the hell is going on?

55:09.220 --> 55:14.840
GLC Prize. Explain the horsey you've got here. It has a push button.

55:14.840 --> 55:18.140
It's not just your average horse toy.

55:18.140 --> 55:22.100
It's a sex toy for both boys and girls, you see.

55:22.100 --> 55:23.420
Because

55:23.420 --> 55:24.920
its beautiful face

55:24.920 --> 55:27.600
gives great head.

55:27.600 --> 55:31.120
And then I see you're caressing that face right now.

55:31.120 --> 55:34.040
Yes, yes. Me and Eve have a lot of fun.

55:34.040 --> 55:35.640
And then, if you flip a-

55:35.640 --> 55:37.200
Eve is in Summer's Eve.

55:37.200 --> 55:38.440
Over.

55:38.440 --> 55:41.120
That's the girls' side.

55:41.120 --> 55:45.880
This is just like the Harry Potter broomstick that vibrates.

55:45.880 --> 55:48.920
Yeah, those are banned in Australia

55:48.920 --> 55:53.020
because 12-year-old girls are riding them for more than an hour.

55:53.020 --> 55:55.080
You must be this tall to ride.

55:55.080 --> 55:59.720
Yeah, does that rule apply to, uh, Eve?

55:59.720 --> 56:03.160
I can stand up and then give me head.

56:03.160 --> 56:06.280
fair enough all right

56:06.280 --> 56:09.260
i think that's better than the parent i think we've got some competition for the

56:09.260 --> 56:12.560
fair in europe where jamie go

56:12.560 --> 56:15.400
all she's up to no good

56:15.400 --> 56:18.600
i think that's what's going to go cause some havoc

56:18.600 --> 56:22.760
oh my god it's initial d live

56:22.760 --> 56:25.480
it's initial d live

56:25.480 --> 56:29.300
the reason why i don't think that's what he has left about it

56:29.300 --> 56:33.620
We're, we're, we're, I've decided that at the next convention, on a big convention I

56:33.620 --> 56:36.660
guess I'm gonna cosplay as Ulog.

56:36.660 --> 56:37.660
I'm doing that.

56:37.660 --> 56:38.660
Any fan of me, man.

56:38.660 --> 56:39.860
Back to Fremont, hello.

56:39.860 --> 56:41.100
Back to the topic at hand.

56:41.100 --> 56:45.360
The reason why I'm yelling initial D live, you had all the step squad walking out towards

56:45.360 --> 56:47.180
the cars, the race track.

56:47.180 --> 56:49.340
I didn't know that they were actually going over there to take a group picture.

56:49.340 --> 56:51.380
I thought they were actually all gonna get little go-karts and race.

56:51.380 --> 56:52.380
No, we were gonna take a picture.

56:52.380 --> 56:53.380
So I was like, initial D live!

56:53.380 --> 56:58.700
I thought you were talking, oh what about like, the one that drove by in the big car

56:58.700 --> 57:02.700
with the whole of the muffler. There we go. Oh my god, your cock's so big!

57:02.700 --> 57:07.700
God, I hate guys with big cars. Anyway, moving on, interviews.

57:07.700 --> 57:14.700
All of Step Squad hates me right now, it's all good. Alright, I'll be back later.

57:14.700 --> 57:22.700
Alright, this is the portion of the show where we just give the microphone to Jahi and watch what happens.

57:22.700 --> 57:25.900
Oh God. They keep doing this.

57:25.900 --> 57:29.660
I don't know why. So now I'm walking around and I have a mic.

57:29.660 --> 57:35.020
I think he just really doesn't give a rat's ass at this point. He's just, he's just letting me go.

57:35.020 --> 57:40.780
He's just letting me go. I'm like the, like, man on the street host. I don't know.

57:40.780 --> 57:44.700
Alright, so right now I'm walking around the front of, uh, Game Zone

57:44.700 --> 57:51.500
Fremont. This is my old stomping grounds right here. Good shot to my friend, uh, Walter Williams. We used to walk here all the time. It's a nice arcade. And we're here with, um,

57:51.500 --> 57:53.500
Natto. Natto, how's it going, man?

57:53.500 --> 57:54.500
Yeah, pretty good, man. How's it going?

57:54.500 --> 57:56.500
Cool, cool. Yeah, so you're here with Final Hyper, girl?

57:56.500 --> 57:58.500
Yes, yes I am, yeah.

57:58.500 --> 58:00.500
I'm assuming you're, like, happy today because she hasn't whipped you.

58:00.500 --> 58:06.500
Well, yeah, oh, yeah. Like, I'm very fortunate that she hasn't whipped me yet, but she's, like, kicking the crap out of me right now.

58:06.500 --> 58:12.500
VHD being the SSA or she is, she's kicking the shit out of Natto right now. They're probably going to have to edit that out on the show.

58:12.500 --> 58:20.500
I got tons of people out here. Um, Khan's here, DCB's over here with his Kirk Cameron photo, which has traumatized me a lot.

58:20.500 --> 58:30.280

59:09.360 --> 59:13.900
All right, we're going to get run over, so I'm going to move. Fuzzy's drunk ass is driving

59:13.900 --> 59:15.860
to hell with AORI, so I'm about to interview them in a minute.

59:15.860 --> 59:19.940
How are you two gentlemen today? Are you competing in the tournament today?

59:19.940 --> 59:20.940
Yes, I am.

59:20.940 --> 59:21.940
Great, great. What's your name?

59:21.940 --> 59:22.940

59:22.940 --> 59:25.100
Pete, I'm the one that's running the tournament.

59:25.100 --> 59:29.540
Okay, so Pete's one of the staffers here that I haven't met yet, and he has, what does that

59:29.540 --> 59:33.980

59:36.500 --> 59:39.420
I'm gonna be playing long train of run in my freshman's freestyle.

59:39.420 --> 59:44.580
Wow. Okay, so we actually have somebody here with guitar skills, so we're not gonna hear Stairway to Heaven, right?

59:44.580 --> 59:45.500
Uh, correct.

59:45.500 --> 59:49.780
Thank you. Thank you, God. So how's the tournament been running today?

59:49.780 --> 59:54.220
It's good. Yeah, at first, no, it was not good. There's like five people showed up, but then, yeah, everyone showed up.

59:54.220 --> 59:56.420
Cool. So how many people do you think you have here today?

59:56.420 --> 01:00:00.140
Uh, maybe like 80.

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.780
Wow. No, no. I don't know.

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:03.300
We'll find out later if that's...

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:06.340
How many tournaments have you run? This is my first one.

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:11.340
Is this the, from the tournaments that you've been to in DDR, is this like the average turnout for a tournament about 80, 100 people?

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:12.340
Yes it is.

01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:13.340
Good turnout for the most part?

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:14.340
Yeah.

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:15.340
Everybody makes their money back and...

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:17.340
Yeah, everything's good.

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:22.340
Okay, he looks like he's scared as hell because I have a microphone right here. Don't worry, it's Orange Lounge. Everybody's half drunk anyway.

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:26.340
Orange Lounge owns you, go to that website. Okay, we got another person over here. This is...

01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:29.340
I so can't read that, that's Chaos. Okay, how's it going, man?

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:30.340
What's up, man?

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:31.340
How you doing today?

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.340
I'm pretty good.

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:33.340
Did you already compete today?

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:34.340
Yep, I got third place in PA.

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:39.940
Wow third place in PA and he's getting he beat me at PA sniff. That's okay. I wasn't even supposed to be there

01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:41.940
Anyway, you beat me

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:48.740
Miracles happen, I don't know. I just I just remember everyone that sounds like oh, yeah

01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:52.500
it's gonna be this this and this and as always the top three they always mean but I

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:57.920
Don't know it's just I I woke up on the right side of bed, I guess

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.920
but I was able to go due to some reasons.

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:01.760
really because of emphasis and of course Tigger

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:05.120
I still fear emphasis and Tigger I'm like you know like a newbie when it

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.520
comes to the whole PA thing

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:10.480
so Cory's stealing his money so but yeah but

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:14.000
so how did you feel about third place what song did you play as your last song when you competed?

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.640
we played... what did we play? we played Kakamei

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:23.760
Heavy. Oh but the listeners after this tournament did take place on a DDR7 mix

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.760
so Kakamei is just nasty anyway

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:26.760
I did not.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:27.760
Why not have a cock?

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:28.760
We got nuts.

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.760
We got balls.

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:30.760
We got cock.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:31.760
It's a regular gay porno out here.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:32.760
I think I see Ken Stryker walking in right now.

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:33.760
And Hanzo just ran out when he heard about the nuts.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:34.760
FYI, it's Jeff Stryker.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:35.760
Not that I know these things.

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:36.760
Balls and cock.

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.760
How you doing, Hanzo?

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:38.760
Oh, hey now.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:39.760
Hey now.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:40.760
I don't be getting down like that.

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:41.760
I'm going to leave that up for you.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:42.760
But, hey.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:43.760
Hey.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:44.760

Hey.

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:53.760
Hey.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:54.760
Hey.

01:02:54.760 --> 01:03:01.420
for you, but hey, I'm not down with the whole nuts and cocks thing. I don't swag. I'd rather

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:05.600
be down with that than be down with what R. Kelly was down with, though. You're right,

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:11.720
that is all bad. That whole yellow shower thing? No, no. Anybody here like the yellow

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:17.560
shower thing? No. Exactly. Scott wanted to play a song. We're going to let Scott play

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.560
Alright, I'll go play Long Chain of Runnin' from 7th Mix.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.560
Alrighty. Let's do it.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:24.560

Cool. Wow, you had a long trip coming out here. We're in Fremont, California today.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.160
I know we are.

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:48.160
That's exactly right. Good job.

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.160
Where part of San Francisco are you from?

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:54.160
I don't live there. I was from there. I was born and conceived there.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.160
Okay, where do you live now?

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.160

Okay, so he's right down the street practically here.

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.160
Yeah, I'm right down the street. That's cool.

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.160
This is like mild stomping grounds. Do you like it here?

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:07.160
Oh, yeah. This is very gravy, I believe is the terminology.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:10.160
You like being able to walk home at night and not get stabbed and stuff?

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.160
Oh yes I do, yes I do.

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.160
Or not get held at gunpoint for my gay porn.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.160
I mean, wait.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.160
Axe is a busy, busy man.

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.160
So did you compete today or are you waiting to compete?

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:23.160
I'm waiting to compete. I'm going to be doing my cultural freestyle to La Señorita.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:26.160
I couldn't believe I said that as well as I possibly could.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:29.160
Now just so I don't have a bunch of people who are pissed off, shoot me later.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:31.160
Are you part Mexican or Latino?

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.160

I celebrate single-to-mouth till noon, then I'm done.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:39.600
Alright, so remember, this is Oxus Freestyle.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:43.120
If you are mad at the cultural freestyle, if you see it on the internet, do not shoot

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.120
me.

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.560
I did not endorse this.

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:48.280
I think Dark Stalker wants the mic back because it's like a cock.

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:49.280
I don't know.

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.280
Oh, baby.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.280
No.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.280
It's, I believe, time for Freshness Freestyle.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.280
Yay!

01:05:54.280 --> 01:06:01.080
Time for Freshness Freestyle, where everybody can do knee drops and hand slaps.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:02.080
Newbie Freshness.

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.080

Wait, wait, wait.

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:32.960
Am I white?

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:33.960
Wait, what am I wearing?

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:34.960
What am I wearing?

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:35.960
The FUBU.

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:36.960
Yes, the FUBU.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:37.960
I'm not white.

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:38.960
Now, wait a minute.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:39.960
A white girl tied for the winner yesterday at the competition.

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:40.960
No.

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.320
Yeah, we have our first place winner.

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:45.200
The first place team was half white.

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.200
Yep.

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.200
Oh, yeah.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.200
Oh, yeah.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.200
All right.

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.200
Yeah, it was half white.

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.200
That's why.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.840
Because first place, it was actually one of the best routines I've seen in a very, very

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:55.840
long time.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:57.840
Well choreographed.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.840
It was a good routine.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.840
It was a good routine, yes.

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:05.840
But like 99% of the time, white guys don't freestyle at all.

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:07.840
Well...

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.840
Oh, I mean...

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:12.840
Give us some credit. Dave over here can do the grapevine.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.840
What are you talking about, Dave?

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:16.840
White guys don't freestyle.

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:18.840
Look at Kyle Snyder!

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:22.840
Can we go to break now, please? We'll come back and we'll finish talking about freestyle.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:27.840
So send me your refuse. If you don't want to come in the chat room and do it, you can send us an email.

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:28.840
Jamie, give us that address.

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:35.840
Um, words. No. It's orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com.

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.840
Alrighty, so we'll be right back.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:42.840
Sorry? Oh, bitches. I thought you said and then.

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:43.840
And then?

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:44.840
And then? No, and then.

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:49.840
We'll be right back after some more happy fun MP3s from Xtreme.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:22.600
I can't wait to see you in the next video!

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:32.600
I'll see you in the next video!

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:42.600
I'll see you in the next video!

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:37.560
Give it to me good Give it to me good

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:55.560
Are you ready?

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:27.560
Yes, it's love we share

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.560
You are a super dancer!

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:33.560
Yes, we only stay together

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:38.560
Lashing hands, dancing and turning

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:40.560
Turn away

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.560
What a great feeling!

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:46.560
Awaken more than only letting you go

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:51.560
I, I have to let you go

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:54.560
I just want you to know

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:56.560
Can you hear the cheering?

01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:00.560
The one, the one I love

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:09.560
Super performance

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:17.560
I, I have to let you go

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.560
May you remember me

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:24.560
Let me forget you

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:30.560
The one I love, is, I only have to let you go

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.560
I just want you to know

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:38.560
You'll always be the one I love

01:13:54.560 --> 01:14:00.560
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:10.200
I want to see Captain Jack cry.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.200
We're back.

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:14.600
Mommy, sing me a fast trip machine.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:20.080
My phone's going off.

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:25.420
In that set we heard Love on a Trip Machine and Memories.

01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:26.800
It's a polytary song!

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:27.800
What the hell happened?

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:31.800
It is a Polteri song, however, it's a good Polteri song where she can hold a key.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:35.800
That's right, you'll all come around eventually.

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:36.800
I've been listening to Polteri since way back.

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:40.440
Yeah, but she's not holding up on her head between her ears, okay?

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:41.440
Like that friggin' bunny.

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.240
Is she balancing pancakes on her head?

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:45.240
She should be.

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:47.640
Okay, yeah.

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:50.460
So what's up next, Rob?

01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:53.800
I wanted to talk about Freestyle, because we've got Xplizit.

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:54.800
Let's talk to Xplizit.

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:57.360
He's somebody who we haven't had on the show before.

01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:01.480
the mic, how you doing? Alright, I'm doing alright. You missed Fremont yesterday, what

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:06.640
gives? I have some family stuff to take care of. Ah, family crap, I know how that goes.

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:13.360
So, what do you think about freestyle today in the DDR world? How's it going there? I'm

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:18.480
working on it very well. I'm trying to get better and better and better as well. As y'all

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:24.620
know, I used to be explicit alpha like last year and everything. I'm on the beta stage.

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:26.860
We gamma coming soon?

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:29.740
As the beta dies off.

01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:33.220
I want it to die off after MGL.

01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:36.660
And later on we can call you Explicit Pie.

01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:38.460
Oh my gosh.

01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:40.420
And speaking of freestyle, I got

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:42.300
routines already planned.

01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:43.980
You like an extreme?

01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:45.060
So far so good.

01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:47.540
Very freestyle-able stuff in there?

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:49.460
Yeah, there's like a lot of good songs in there.

01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:52.220
A lot of variations.

01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:54.220
That song was like, We Will Rock You.

01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:56.220
That was like one of the most off-picks.

01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:57.220
The Ballbox!

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:59.220
Oh my gosh!

01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:02.220
I'm wondering what that Ricky Martin song was, I was like, oh my gosh.

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:05.220
I'm waiting to see someone do a routine to Bag.

01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:07.220
I'm waiting.

01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:12.220
You know, I would even be half tempted to take the Cup of Life and bring out my Samba de Amigo maracas.

01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:16.220
I'll do Bag, I'll wear the kilt, commando style.

01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:19.220
Come on everybody, you know you want it.

01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:24.220
Then I can get the, you know, cock-whipped-out thing, you know, done.

01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:26.220
Dot, dot, dot.

01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:27.220
Anyway.

01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:30.220
Yeah, why is it that nobody whips their cock out at the end of a routine?

01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:31.220
That's what I really want to know.

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:33.220
Why have these freestylers done that?

01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:40.220
Just at the end, go, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, yeah, there it is.

01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:42.220
Why hasn't anyone done that explicit?

01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:43.220
It happens.

01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:48.220
Well, they've got planned routines, they do whatever they want.

01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:52.220
I can say something very mean right now, but I'm not going to do it.

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:53.220
Say it!

01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:54.220
No!

01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:55.220
I can't, I'm going to get killed.

01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:56.220
Fine.

01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:58.220
Save it for next show.

01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:00.900
Oh, okay.

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:03.220
What's the next big tour you plan on competing in, locally, here?

01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:08.220
Well, probably the one in Sacramento that's coming out in March, because I've heard all

01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:09.220
about it.

01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:10.220
Right.

01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:11.220
And B3, which is in April.

01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:13.220
Ah, it's going to be big.

01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:16.900
Actually, from what I understand, it might be postponed until May, but the details are

01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:23.780
Actually, I'm pretty sure that the confirmed dates are going to be the second weekend in

01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:29.700
May, which should be the 11th and 12th. But I'm pretty sure that's the confirmed date

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:36.120
now that the planned... In case people are wondering, planned events should be a Beat

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:46.120
Menias score competition, both freestyle and PA for DDR, and a Dance Maniacs tournament

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.120
too.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:49.280
Wow, Dance Maniacs, interesting.

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:51.680
I might actually compete in a Dance Maniacs tournament.

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:54.320
Dance Maniacs, actually, I can kind of dance to.

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:57.780
It's kind of, it's a shock, but anyway, I'm sorry.

01:17:57.780 --> 01:18:00.120
So you'll be doing the B3 tournament too as well, huh?

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:01.120
Indeed.

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:03.120
Shaking your ass don't count.

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:04.120
Whatever, whatever.

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:10.960
Any friends listening, you might want to say hello to, anything you want to say, you're

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:11.960
waiting for it.

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:12.960
Well, the shout-outs to the visionaries.

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:18.520
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the Fremont tournament, but I heard about the Fremont

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.520
tournament and I struck winds.

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:21.520
Good shit.

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:22.520
But again, I wasn't able to.

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:26.360
It's the first tourney that I've actually, well, I did one, I judged one small tourney

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:30.360
at Sac State last year, but this is the first major tourney that I've gotten to judge.

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:31.360
It was interesting.

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.760
I like judging because they get a front row seat.

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:34.760
Indeed.

01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:36.680
I got a front row seat too.

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:38.680
You were sitting on the ground in front of me.

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:43.880
Well, yeah, I had a front row seat that was closer than Rob except my ass got sore and

01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:44.880
I...

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:45.880
Whoa!

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:46.880
Whoa!

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:48.400
Not that way!

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:53.240
My feet fell asleep and I was in a really bad spot when I had to go get up and take

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:57.000
a piss four times because I drank too much soda during the day.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:02.140
I had a second row spot and what was awesome is when I couldn't see anything behind certain

01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:05.780
people, I was sitting right next to the camera, so just watch the viewfinder, perfect shot

01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:07.400
of the whole thing.

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:11.820
I had a backstage pass, all of the stuff Scott was hanging out outside, so we were just sort

01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:14.940
of watching from the back of the machine going, whoa.

01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:17.740
And there was of course the running commentary by a few people back there, you know that

01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:22.460
person has a good technique, but you know, they're random.

01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:23.460
What do you think about that?

01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:25.820
We were kind of talking a little bit about this during breaks, kind of a con...oh yes,

01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:32.820
Okay. All I gotta say is, Kakumei! Kakumei! Kakumei! Oh my gosh. Let the joke die, step

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:43.760
away from the joke. Hey, I just heard cock and I was like, oh, where? How large? One

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:49.200
thing I want to ask you, as a freestyler, because nobody else in this room can dance,

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:54.640
but as a freestyler, just kidding, all in good fun, as a freestyler, what do you think

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:57.920
about, this is kind of controversial, what do you think about the typical way to judge

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:01.480
attorney where you have the points, you grade everybody on a scale of 100 as opposed to

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:05.160
this new, semi-new tower system they've got going, what do you think about that?

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:10.200
Well, they're both good in certain ways, but sometimes some people get too offended with

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:15.160
the scores, like if they get lower than 70 they think they've done very bad, but if they

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:19.080
get like over 80 they think okay, and if they get 90 they do pretty good.

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:22.820
Which as far as I know, you know, the way, if I remember the way grades work, you have

01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:32.500
You have to get 50 or below to get an F. If you get 70 and 80, that's the C. That's average.

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:33.500
Maybe I'm just a tough judge.

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:34.500
That's how I'd grade them.

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:35.980
Between 70 and 80 would be average.

01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:38.940
But with the tower, somebody's got to be on the bottom.

01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:40.300
Somebody's going to be on the bottom, right?

01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:41.300
That kind of sucks, too.

01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:45.460
Yeah, but the only thing about the tower system is it prevents people from getting biased

01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:50.260
because some people might complain if they don't get into qualifying the actual brackets.

01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:57.340
Well, I also got to think too that with the tower system there's usually in most cases there are people that deserve the bottom spot

01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:04.180
Well, I mean there are a few cases where like there are tournaments where there's all good freestyles like CVGL 1

01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:10.480
But there are some a lot of tournaments where some people just don't deserve anything higher than the bottom spot

01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:16.600
Well as far as the tower system goes when I went to MGL the way the grid was kind of unique

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:19.380
But it kind of took a long time because there's like a lot of people participating

01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:26.380
participating. When I saw the scores, the top 8 will only be in the list. So far 15

01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:32.100
people placed, especially me when I was an NGO. Like Bruce LeRoy, he got perfect eights

01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:35.180
on his section. Of course his routine was very good.

01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:37.980
You know the way they did it, they changed a little bit for this one yesterday. They

01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:42.660
did do complete towers. We had to do the whole damn thing, everybody. And the person who

01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:48.100
I put at the bottom, the person I put at the very bottom, I wouldn't say that it was necessarily

01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:54.000
bad. It was fun and it's the kind of thing where I think if I'd seen it Friday night

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.200
at the arcade it would have been cool, but at the tournament level it wasn't well prepared

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:02.440
and polished. I think things when they're in a tournament need to be polished and it's

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:06.360
all about show and presentation. This was just kind of looked more like, I'm just having

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:10.880
fun. It would have been cool for a Friday night at the arcade routine, but as a tournament

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:14.440
it didn't strike me as anything special.

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:17.840
As far as the tournament goes, if a routine looks like something that people could do

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:19.520
it on Friday night, it wouldn't be okay.

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:23.280
But if it looks like a routine that people have to put their heart on, like practice,

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:24.280
practice, practice.

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:25.280
Huh?

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:26.280
Did you say hard on?

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:27.280
No!

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:28.280
Heart!

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:29.280
Not hard on!

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.280
Who could look it down my pants?

01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:31.280
Ow!

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:35.120
Well, you're doing well with this group.

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:38.760
Okay, I've got the jump to conclusions mat.

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:44.940
Well, my whole thing about the tower, I think that it still opens up the door for bias even

01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:49.980
though you've got multiple people, which is why I don't know if anyone remembers the one

01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:56.320
that I did at Shaft by having you judge on parts of the percentage.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:02.960
And that way the final result is based on each individual piece rather

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:04.780
than just giving them a flat score.

01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:08.000
I think that that sort of closes the door on bias too.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.240
And it still actually allows room for bias because one of the sections was,

01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:14.220
what is your opinion of this, of this match?

01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:17.160
What is you as someone just watching it, what do you think?

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:21.300
Because that also has something to do with it because you've got to think that the crowd that's watching,

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.040
they're also thinking the same thing.

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:27.300
They're not necessarily watching, oh, how well their feet move or how polished are they.

01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:29.480
They're saying, oh, I like this or I don't like this.

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.440
True. I think that to some point bias should play a part in it.

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:37.320
But because you have multiple judges, you have more room to work with.

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:42.320
If people don't get biased, then people will not improve on their routines.

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:45.320
I've seen people who say, oh, they've got low scores.

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:48.320
They actually look at their stats to see what they need to work on.

01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:51.320
Hell, I even do that, like what mistakes I've made.

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:54.320
Like what mistakes I've made and everything.

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.320
Or what other people make mistakes.

01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:00.320
At the end of the day, try to think of the negatives and not do it.

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:04.320
Look at the positives and work on that even more and make it a better routine.

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:07.960
That's what I try to do as well as the judges, write something negative and something positive

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:08.960
about everybody.

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:12.400
I put something negative about the people I put in first place or person, then I put

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:14.400
something positive about the person I put in last place.

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.720
Just because, you know, everybody wants to hear something good and bad.

01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:17.720
Yeah, true.

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:21.040
But sometimes some people get very offended with it, so they want advice.

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:26.600
Like, try to do something original, you could say that, if the routine is not original.

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:29.680
Or try to be more smooth, you could say, or something like that.

01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:32.200
It's like, guys, the ketchup dance is not that original.

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:33.200
Stick to P.A.

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:09.560
I advise them, try to make your moves smooth, try not to fumble on a few moves, try to make

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:14.760
your routine a little bit creative, lose enough, have some fun, don't take it too seriously.

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:19.440
I've seen people make mistakes, like trying to memorize the steps and everything, and

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:23.400
it ends up making them so nervous that they're getting everything.

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:28.000
That's always when I judge, the biggest thing that I look for is I look for their expression.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.420
I don't care if they miss one of their moves.

01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:33.920
I don't know what they had planned.

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:39.200
I haven't been sitting there looking at their choreographed piece of paperwork or at the

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.200
screen.

01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:43.320
I'll look, I'll glance at the screen occasionally to see if maybe they're hitting the steps

01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:49.280
okay because that shows preparation, but the first thing I look for is to see how they're

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:54.160
smoothing over their mistakes, how they are portraying themselves, and if they're playing

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.160
to the crowd.

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:59.200
If they're sitting there with this high energy routine and they're just there going ooh on

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:02.120
on their face, I'm not gonna enjoy it.

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:03.840
True, they must have like a smile on their face

01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:06.260
to show that they're actually having fun.

01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:07.100
Exactly.

01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:08.960
Like that face.

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:11.480
As much as I hate to use her as an example,

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:14.280
one person who I think actually does display this,

01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:18.480
what I'm talking about is actually Fiona, Dr. Hikaru.

01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:20.040
When she freestyles, she smiles.

01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:22.640
She plays to the crowd.

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:27.640
Maybe, you know, I'm talking about actually as a performer,

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:32.600
She actually does have good performance skills because you never, at least any time I've

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:36.860
ever seen her do anything, she never looks like she's concentrating too hard.

01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:42.760
She looks like she's performing, putting forth the best show, putting forth the best face

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:44.320
for the audience.

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.920
And that's what freestyle should be, I think.

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:46.920
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:50.840
Almost like most of the people who are raking the tops, that's where they belong.

01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:55.920
Think of people like Hypnotics, Bruce Leroy, or AJ.

01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:00.880
Those are people I've never seen sit and frown while they're doing a high energy performance.

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:04.400
They're awesome.

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:07.360
It's just your expression.

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.760
I think that 50% of a performance is your expression.

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:11.760
The rest of it is the work.

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.120
True, true.

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:17.520
So you're saying if I smile the whole time and just play, then I'll get like 50?

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.520
No, I'm not saying that.

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.100
No no no no!

01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:25.640
Yeah, you get 50 and the rest of it will suck.

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:28.920
Then I'll throw in a knee drop and you get a 95!

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:34.740
Well, 50 would be better than what I got last time!

01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:38.360
Reserve the Knee Drops, Hand Plugs, Matrix Walks, and Bar Raping!

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:43.360
But you had everybody going, ooh, right when you started, you know.

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:45.220
Anyway, uhh.

01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:48.000
Hey, what's the deal?

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Hey, what's the deal? I mean, I know these songs are played out, but maybe somebody can do something original with it.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:01.000
I mean, hey, they don't know you. They don't know how you would have just busted out some crazy shit or something.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Come on, comment, somebody! Please, help me! I'm drowning!

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.000
I don't know, I kind of want to see someone like Kid Zero do a routine to Dynamite Ray or something,

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:14.000
because he could actually make one look really, really good if he wanted to. I mean, he's crazy.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Well, the only problem with the steps, the only thing I don't like about the song is the steps, the actual basic steps. There's so many jumps.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Well, the thing about this is that even steps, you know, that could even though open up the door for trying to innovate on how to do a jump, you know.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:38.000
There's different ways to do things, you know. I wanted to do, I wanted actually, I had one worked out a long time ago and all I had was second mix.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000
I had a routine worked out to W W involving pom poms, doing a cheerleading dance.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Cool.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000
I'm not sure if that's seen by SVGL or not.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000
And you know what, though? It would work because of the jumps.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Because I was a lot more flexible in those days.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:59.000
And you know what, CaptainJackBasic? You can riverdance on that.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Yeah, I've heard about that.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Who knows? People could start freestyling to Max 300 and Max Unlimited.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
It could happen.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
I did that before.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
How does that work?

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Well...

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Lotta poppin' lockin' and um...

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Um...

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
A lot of vid to get.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000
So what do you actually...

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Yes, exactly.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000
What do you notice is the current trends in freestyle? What type of styles are people aiming more toward?

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Well...

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Not including new-buy styles. Sorry if I'm offending anybody who does those hand-plants, knee-drops, etc. etc. etc.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Well, true.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
It's all I can do, man!

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Hahahaha!

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:42.000
But people like aiming some stuff they see from music videos or whatever, sometimes they're trying to make up their own.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Some people have their own signature moves. Almost everybody has their own signature moves.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:57.000
I actually don't see a problem with an occasional hand plant or an occasional knee drop as long as it doesn't make their whole routine and actually maybe a transition to another move.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Yeah, like, if you want to do something like, if you see After the Game of Love by Tranpower

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:11.000
and Shaft, he did like a knee-drop, but he did like a very special version of it, like a slap-drop.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Like a, what would I say, romantic or exotic somewhat.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000
He laid a smackdown onto the pad.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.000
He showed some love to that down arrow.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Oh no, impregnation right there.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.640
Let it down.

01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:31.440
Or people do hand slaps on the ground just to play around.

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:35.400
Yeah, as long as you're just not like, oh, I'm standing.

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:36.720
Oh, my knee's on the right arrow.

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:37.720
Oh, I'm standing again.

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:39.240
That, you know, no.

01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:43.200
But I think that I don't think that people should just

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:46.720
automatically discount a type of move because it's old

01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:47.920
or lots of people have done it.

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:49.320
You just have to innovate on it.

01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:49.960
Yeah, true.

01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:52.120
You don't want to repeat the same hand, plant, knee drop

01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:53.800
move over and over and over unless you're

01:30:53.800 --> 01:31:07.960
something like 18. Yeah. DZP, no preliciting to this. He is, he says hi. DZP, I remember

01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:12.720
I was supposed to promise you that I was going to bring some balls, like 20 packs, but. We

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:19.920
saw plenty of balls yesterday. Including bouncing ones that were multicolored. But again I hope

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:24.480
to come to the one in Sacramento for P3. I'm going to see you there.

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:27.680
I'm just wondering, because I was out of the room for a little bit, did we do FUs already?

01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:31.840
No, we need to do our FUs of the Week. Want to do a break and then do them, or want to

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:33.840
do them now? Let's do them now, and then we'll take a break.

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:38.040
Alright, we'll do them now. Here we go. Starting off, boys and girls.

01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:42.600
Bad Bulls out the list. Oh my God. Alright, we got a big, big FUs

01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:46.560
of the Week segment, so here it goes, ladies and gentlemen. We have a lot of new listeners

01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:50.840
to the show tonight, Jamie, I know I have you do this a lot, but I think it's important.

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:53.520
Let's remind the listeners what the FUs of the Week are all about.

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:58.880
Our FUs of the Week is where we take everything that we think sucks and go, fuck you!

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.840
Fuck you right in your ass!

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:03.240
And do they have to be about DDR or any of that stuff?

01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:04.240
No.

01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:05.240
They can be whatever the hell you want.

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:06.240
Exactly.

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:11.600
This is when you give them a fuck, you shove so far up their ass, they're tasting the chalk.

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:13.600
That being said, Jamie.

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:15.600
I want to terror mix today.

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:20.600
My F.U. goes out to Jamie for being a picky bitch.

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:27.600
I wanted to start off with the best line from video game music ever.

01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:30.600
This is fucked up? Hold on, let me see if I can find it.

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:32.600
There it is. Slag work terror.

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:34.600
Here we go.

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:59.600
My Fuck You of the Week, first and foremost, goes toward MapQuest. Except I was asleep for most of the trip, but I had to pee. MapQuest got us lost, but I'll let Rob be the one that's gonna go that way.

01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:08.600
My other fuck you goes to the bump in the parking lot at Funtime Pizza, because I had to pee then too.

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:12.600
And the bump was big, and it made me have to pee more.

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:16.600
My other fuck you goes towards...

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:23.600
There's one I've been debating about mentioning, because I really just think it's more hilarious than anything.

01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:30.600
To the little fucker who's been spamming my LiveJournal, I know who you are, and I think it's damn funny that you're still bringing this up.

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:33.600
My god, people just can't let stuff drop.

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.600
Anyway, that was pretty...

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:37.600
It was pretty hilarious, I had a laugh.

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:38.600
Shine lose.

01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:39.600
Shine lose.

01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:49.600
Um, my other fuck you goes toward my cold, um, which actually had me comatose on Wednesday thanks to my quill, capital N, small i, big fucking Q.

01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:51.600
Green death, orange death.

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.600
Green death.

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:57.600
You know, my teeth are green. Merry Christmas.

01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:01.600
But it's settled in my lungs, and I've had nasty ass cough.

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:07.600
And I was going to do PA yesterday, but because of my cough, I haven't really been able to play much DDR.

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:11.600
It's been hard to walk up the stairs without my asthma acting up.

01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:13.600
Because of my breathing.

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:17.600
Oh my god, you've got a dog between your legs!

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:26.600
You are not supposed to have a dog there, you are supposed to have a pussy there.

01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:28.600
Angels giving you Propel to make it better.

01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:31.600
Thank you. Oh, I like Peach Propel though.

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:38.600
Oh yeah, fuck you to the Walgreens in town for not having Peach Propel yet.

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:48.140
oh yeah I buried my old shoes finally the shoes that I fucked off last week

01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:54.820
and I have new shoes and my shoes are black and gray and yellow my shoes are

01:34:54.820 --> 01:35:00.980
fresh and fuck my shoelaces that I couldn't find because they're purple and

01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:05.980
I found my rainbowy ones, they were too bright.

01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:09.980
Um, and um, um, yeah.

01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:15.980
Oh, and um, um, fuck not being able to think of anything else.

01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:18.980
Oh yes, more fucks!

01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:22.980
Fuck the situation that I heard about today.

01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:28.980
My fiancé, Suzanne, who I love lately, ran into somebody's door.

01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:31.980
It wasn't his fault, it wasn't their person's fault.

01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:36.980
He was just turning into a parking space, um, in a private property and everything,

01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:41.980
and showing you the parking place, and this person with their brand new car that only had 96 miles on it,

01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:44.980
a Chrysler, ran into their open door.

01:35:44.980 --> 01:35:47.980
So the door's fucked up, our front bumper is fucked up.

01:35:47.980 --> 01:35:48.980
This is fucked up.

01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:50.980
And this is indeed fucked up.

01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:58.980
And so now it's going to be on our insurance and their insurance, but I don't think anyone's going to really have a fault for that car thing.

01:35:58.980 --> 01:36:00.980
But I think we're going to be getting a new car, which is cool.

01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:02.980
I want a car.

01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:08.980
And fuck every single 86 Corolla hatchback in town for not being mine.

01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:10.980
And that's it.

01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:13.980
Actually, I'm going to go next, because Loki's list is too big.

01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:14.980
So...

01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:16.980
Fuck Loki's list!

01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:18.980
My list isn't that big.

01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:24.980
My FU of the week, we'll do FU, we'll go around the room to everybody, yeah.

01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:27.980
Okay, yeah, we go first because it's our show.

01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:32.980
Possessive us? No.

01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:38.980
The first FU I'd like to give us to MapQuest, you suck. Die.

01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:44.980
Funtime Happy Pizza Place, or whatever the fuck it was called, is not off of mission.

01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:47.980
It's completely on the other side of the galaxy.

01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:49.980
Why the hell were you telling me it was there?

01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:54.980
Die, die along with your firstborn and your ex-wife.

01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:56.980
I hate you.

01:36:56.980 --> 01:37:01.980
My next F.U. goes out to MTV and music videos in general.

01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:03.980
They were so much cooler in the 80's.

01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:05.980
VH1 classic forever.

01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:07.980
I thought yes, that one animated head.

01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:09.980
VH1 classic forever.

01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:12.980
With the drugs flying out of the neck.

01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:14.980
Uh, Thomas Tobey?

01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:16.980
Uh, yeah, Thomas Tobey.

01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:22.980
F.U. to Nikkari for wearing my shirt yesterday?

01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:24.980
I'm just kidding.

01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:27.980
Nikkari's my hero, what can I say?

01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:34.980
Every day I polish my revolver, and I shoot myself in the head, like a rockstar.

01:37:37.980 --> 01:37:41.980
Um, let's see, what other F.U.s do I have?

01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:47.980
F you to Brad, he's a dick, and uh, alright, that's all I have to say for now, I guess.

01:37:47.980 --> 01:37:50.980
Brad's a dick, like a rockstar.

01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:53.980
And F being single, it still sucks.

01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:58.980
Alright, locate!

01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:04.980
Well, I have a list only because every, um, I found a new use for my camera yesterday since it does record audio.

01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:10.980
I was doing FUs recorded into my camera as I was, you know, recording them.

01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:12.980
So I just typed them up to make it easier.

01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:14.980
Okay, let's start at the top of the list here.

01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:19.980
FU Raley's that's, uh, freakin' near, um, in Fremont, FU to them,

01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:21.980
because they don't have a Chinese food section.

01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:23.980
I really wanted Chinese food.

01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:27.980
They did not have Chinese food to go there, and that pissed me off.

01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:28.980
And on top of that?

01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:29.980
You know why that is, Loki?

01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:33.980
Because right around that Raley's, there's like 50 bazillion Chinese restaurants.

01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:37.740
that doesn't matter that doesn't matter at all to me but they did have cracker

01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:42.380

uh... let's see here

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:14.000
today

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.880
as a computer

01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:21.240
some bitch okay with her ass the size of a Buick. Fucking decides, I don't need to say where I want to sit now!

01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:25.480

01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:31.560
lap dance from you nasty from from this nasty bitch let alone you know while seeing this movie

01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:43.640
you can go to hell your ass is too big for the theater sorry don't come back you hear and um

01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:46.400
Let's see, let's see, let's see.

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:50.900
Um, F.U. to the minivan with license plate 4YKZ148.

01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:53.140
Haha!

01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:56.400
Um, you're a dumbass and you can't drive.

01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:01.040
Um, listen, if you're gonna cut in front of us, stop trying to put on your brakes and shit, and guess what?

01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:05.280
Uh, minivans suck, uh, so you can burn in hell.

01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:09.000
Uh, and finally, finally, oh, oh, uh, one more.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:14.280
um another one is for derby club owners taking different to taking different tokens these tokens

01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:20.280
are so tiny i mean there's why are why don't you just use a standard token size i mean instead of

01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:25.480
having these machines that dispense you smaller tiny ass tokens for this machine it's expensive

01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:29.400
enough and i don't want to have to spend twenty dollars on some tokens and then find out oh look

01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:33.960
they don't fit in the damn machine there's financial reasons for that they say mgl has

01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:39.080
some deal with Sega for like the first 90 days or something they have a machine they have to use

01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:42.680
seven tokens so they can get an exact count of how much money they're making off of this plan.

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:49.080
You mean they could just like oh no go into the freaking operator settings and see the freaking

01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:54.920
stats for that? Like any other machine on the face of the fucking planet? Well actually well

01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:59.080
there's a problem with that because if with all the double token deals they can't get they can't

01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:01.080
make it exactly

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:03.080
why why why why why

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:05.080
it doesn't really fucking matter okay

01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:07.080
you don't understand how arcades work

01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:09.080
you never worked it before

01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:11.080
this is why sega has no systems anymore

01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:13.080
finally

01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:15.080
may i finish

01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:17.080
okay

01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:19.080
finally

01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:21.080
and this is the biggest one of them all

01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:23.080
but people fucking cutting me off in the coiling

01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:25.080
i don't give a fuck if you're running the tournament

01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:27.080
announcing the freaking results for freestyle

01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:01.080
And that's all.

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:05.080
God damn, your face got hella red.

01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:10.080
That deserves applause there. There are veins popping out of his head in places you never knew there were veins.

01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:15.080
Any children listening to this, please do not tell your mother and not be intimidated like this.

01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:20.080
I'm just kidding about that vert, too. That's funny.

01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:25.080

a big fucking hell to my bike because the tire went flat

01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:57.840
again, during class, so I ended up having to walk my bike around everywhere. I thought

01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:05.560
my F2 song was the cat song. I changed my mind. Well, fuck you then! Okay, um, yeah,

01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:13.040
fuck all my new, er, fuck my new math teacher from calculus because he does not speak English

01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:18.680
at all. You wanna fuck your teacher? No, I don't! He's hot for teacher! It's some, it's

01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:23.200
some old scrawny Russian dude that has such a horrible accent, it sounds like he's speaking

01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:28.800
Spanish instead of English. It's bad. I'm looking at, I'm trying to listen to what he's

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:35.800
saying in the lecture and I'm like, what? What, did you say derivative or something

01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:39.280
else? I don't know what you're saying. I just want to stand up and yell at his face. He's

01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:46.280
like

01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:50.960
everybody in this room needs anger management courses right now

01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:56.320
i can manage my anger just fine by kicking someone's ass

01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:03.320
that's what orange lounge is, it's our venting thing, you know, we don't wear anger out here

01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:08.320
No, it's not. I'm still going. I'm still going. I'm still going. I'm still going. I'm still...

01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:10.320
Yeah, it was just meditation.

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:19.320
I have to also add to the fuck you on MapQuest, because next to them I had to sit in the backseat of Rob's car with having to piss.

01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:28.320
I sat there for probably about 45 minutes holding it while we were trying to find this damn pizza place driving around the wrong side of Fremont.

01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:34.400
We're going around Mission Boulevard up 680 up up 880 in a frick big frickin circle

01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:38.840
Well, it'll be one for a minute. It's a big car. I can roll over

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:44.120
I'll just blame it on that guy. Of course the other guy in backseat was mad. Yeah

01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:49.600
And let's see what else

01:45:49.600 --> 01:46:03.600
Fucked my car for having a bad timing belt in it because now I can't bring it up with me to Davis this quarter until it gets fixed and it's going to cost extra dollars to fix.

01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:08.600
And why are you messing with my dog? Don't abuse my dog!

01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:11.600
Well, you were trying to turn its tail into a cock, so it's...

01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:19.600
Well, let's see, I had one more. I think I had one more. I'm trying to remember what it is.

01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:29.600
Fuck my hard drive for being too small because I couldn't burn CDs because it didn't have enough room to copy the information.

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:31.600
What's wrong, HardDriveEnvy?

01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:35.600
I only have a 20 gig hard drive. I feel so weak.

01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:38.600
I feel so weak and primitive.

01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:41.600
It's not size that matters, man.

01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:45.600
Wait, actually, this is hard drive talk, I forgot.

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:47.600
Yes, size does matter.

01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:49.600
I still feel smart.

01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:52.600
Done? Are you done? Good.

01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:55.600
Okay, the following...

01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:02.600
The following one, what to say, will be very affinity buildable until then under 17.

01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:04.600
Dave get out

01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:11.560
But it's under 17, it's very offensive, but if you but if you want to listen anyways go ahead

01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:13.480
Don't blame me for everything. I'm gonna say

01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:19.440
Fuck shit cock piss cunt whore. Oh that's

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.380
Okay, the first fuck you have to do it

01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:31.940
it's not this game is one direction one time I got lost for 30 minutes it only

01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:38.300
took me like 15 minutes to get there regularly that's my first house

01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:47.020
what gang fuck being cursed I'm always never gonna just do whatever I could do

01:47:47.020 --> 01:47:52.020
Let me see. Oh yeah, here's the one big F you right here. A big F you right here.

01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:57.020
December 13th. Okay, Friday the 13th. The day of MGL.

01:47:57.020 --> 01:48:01.020
This is the reason why explicit was destroyed.

01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:05.020
The alpha part. And why I switched to beta.

01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:12.020
Let me see. The first part that happened in the morning. I lost my damn disc that had almost all my final stuff I needed to turn in.

01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:14.020
Which cost me like 20% of my grades.

01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:22.520
great yes I had an A to a C or C B to a D which killed me so badly well I

01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:27.720
include computer science 15 yes computer programming and that the teacher said

01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:40.580
plagiarism for that he can kiss my ass I said my 12 minutes cock thank you for

01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:46.360
that visual

01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:49.400
that was you like throwing your cock across the room

01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:52.080
catch jamie, catch

01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:55.300
what do you mean to the word detachable penis

01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:59.660
okay that's it, let me see, back to the day of

01:48:59.660 --> 01:49:02.780
MGL, Friday the 13th

01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:06.740
I tried driving there, almost got into an accident, not my fault

01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:11.740
My car almost burned out because the car fan broke on my car.

01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:15.740
It could have been stuck in the road out of nowhere.

01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:18.740
And B.A. Hella sucks on M.G.O.

01:49:18.740 --> 01:49:26.740
Because what the hell does a Qualifier song have to be so fucking hard compared to M.G.O. 2 Evil?

01:49:26.740 --> 01:49:30.740
Work in my heart, reverse, dark, hidden.

01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:32.740
Why does the rest of it have to be...

01:49:32.740 --> 01:49:35.740
My idea.

01:49:35.740 --> 01:49:45.740
You know, yesterday for Perfect Attack, the Qualifier song was Sugaru, Boost, Rever- No, it wasn't Rever- Boost, uh, Flat. Boost, Flat, Mirror.

01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:52.740
Oh my god, I seeded 13th out of 16 people and I somehow came in 4th in the end. Don't ask me how that happened, anyway.

01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:59.740
Well, Sugaru, that was the easy- That was easy shit. But then my book- How could you do it hidden, dark, reverse? That's like fucked up.

01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:01.740
What the song says.

01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:04.740
This is fucked up.

01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:07.740
Let me see.

01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:11.740
As far as the PA part, that made me less interested in PA.

01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:13.740
Thanks for helping, bitch.

01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:15.740
I'm in jail.

01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:18.740
Since it wasn't put in replay, I screwed up.

01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:22.740
Yes, and I had to do an improv, a straight up improv.

01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:24.740
Playing around, I actually knew the steps.

01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:27.740
But it ended up being too obvious that everybody knew it was just an improv.

01:50:27.740 --> 01:50:32.740
Well, he's a nice place to live, but still, I wanted to do it for my real routine, which I work pretty hard on.

01:50:32.740 --> 01:50:37.740
And I wasted hell on money. That means, like, how much money did I waste?

01:50:37.740 --> 01:50:42.740
Fuck, I wasted 60 bucks total, because not many people pay me back for the balls.

01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:46.740
Not everybody. Half the people pay me back for the balls.

01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:49.740
They say, can I have a free try? Fuck, I have to waste money.

01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:54.740
I almost didn't have enough money to pay for the gas money to come back to Sacramento.

01:50:54.740 --> 01:51:08.740
In other words, I have to borrow money and end up being, I have to pay them back like 5 bucks more, because you get 5 bucks if you can borrow 10 bucks from me.

01:51:08.740 --> 01:51:13.740
Just remember you gotta tell people you give favors like you give head.

01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:15.740
Okay, that's too much to say right there.

01:51:15.740 --> 01:51:19.740
It's, yeah, not at all. It's from Go.

01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:21.740
I won't, yeah.

01:51:21.740 --> 01:51:26.740
Yeah, but just to let you know, that day just killed my reputation.

01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:31.740
But now I'm a new person, so, hahaha, you can't kill me now!

01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:43.740
And I have some problems, fuck the incompatibility between StepMania and like, for some reason my Windows XP does not work with StepMania for some reason.

01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:47.260
okay we'll keep up and put the server that kind of crashed on second money

01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:52.060
forms that is a very fuck fuck fuck that server

01:51:52.060 --> 01:51:56.180
okay because I wanted to the big etiquette port concept yeah that one

01:51:56.180 --> 01:51:59.660
dollar hosting dot com with the commercial with the bouncing babes

01:51:59.660 --> 01:52:03.220
bikinis wearing the pirate shirts that saying you know our

01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:08.840

01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:10.460

01:52:10.460 --> 01:52:14.700
for restoring us back to September without our permission.

01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:18.220
Yeah, I missed the make Eddie get porn contest. I couldn't sign in.

01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:21.060
I missed all the things I was going to get.

01:52:21.060 --> 01:52:25.620
Since I'm like nineteen and a half, I would have been able to get the stuff.

01:52:25.620 --> 01:52:27.820
I still got plenty left, man.

01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:31.380
Don't worry about it. There ended up not being a contest because

01:52:31.380 --> 01:52:33.420
two people entered.

01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:35.320
I was born.

01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:38.940
And so I'm giving just porn out to everyone who entered. So I'll give you that.

01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:57.440
Does Brad have- are you done with your episode?

01:55:57.440 --> 01:55:58.400
Yes, I am done.

01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:05.400

01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:35.360
Alright, let's get to the chatroom menus.

01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:37.360
You're going to have to cut these ones down, Rob, I think.

01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:40.360
I'm going to read these fast. I'm doing speed reader, okay? Here we go.

01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:42.360

Fuck you, Tigger, for getting seven grades on Fantasy Max 1 version.

01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:11.360

USFBB says fuck you to all those people who wouldn't help me earlier in my quest for knowledge

01:57:50.660 --> 01:57:52.220

01:57:57.340 --> 01:57:58.340

DDR Angel, my fuck you this week, is at my journal, livejournal.com slash tilde k-a-y-l-e-a.

01:58:43.260 --> 01:58:46.900
Go to last night's entry and read at random. The whole story is there. Only reason I said

01:58:46.900 --> 01:58:52.620
check my current journal post for the FU is because I don't know how to word it right.

01:58:52.620 --> 01:58:56.980
I thought our journals protected everybody anyway, so how are we going to read it? Well,

01:58:56.980 --> 01:59:03.980
I have access, but anyway. Brad, shut the fuck up. 23rd Magus says, let Explicit know

01:59:03.980 --> 01:59:06.700
Not explicit, no, I'm working on my Maxell limited routine.

01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:09.260
I have an F.U. to scroll once again.

01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:11.180
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it in its fucking ear.

01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:12.660
I also have an F.U. to stoic.

01:59:12.660 --> 01:59:16.540
Before Jamie kills me, I'm talking about the steps by Chacrilla, not the song.

01:59:16.540 --> 01:59:18.940
The song is leet, the steps are masochistic to play.

01:59:18.940 --> 01:59:23.500
Fuck 56k, I need to fucking download some MP3s for my DJ bit, and I get one song every

01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:24.500
half hour.

01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:25.500
What the fuck?

01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:26.500
Okay, out.

01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:27.500
I thought Jamie didn't like stoic.

01:59:27.500 --> 01:59:28.500
Okay.

01:59:28.500 --> 01:59:32.660
Wait, so the play-through magazine actually related to talking to me?

01:59:32.660 --> 01:59:33.660
Jamie doesn't like stoics.

01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:35.660
Oh, yes, that's what I thought, Magus.

01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:36.660
Good luck.

01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:40.660
It's not as easy as you think, though, unless if you're doing beginner mode.

01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:42.660
Yeah, there's a beginner mode, actually.

01:59:42.660 --> 01:59:44.660
But, anyway, just good luck.

01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:46.660
I want to see the routine sometime.

01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:49.660
I want to see the Legend of Max on maniac routine.

01:59:49.660 --> 01:59:50.660
Good luck.

01:59:50.660 --> 01:59:51.660
You'll need it.

01:59:51.660 --> 01:59:52.660
Oh, God.

01:59:52.660 --> 01:59:54.660
SoCalKick says,

01:59:54.660 --> 02:00:00.660
Fuck Saturday school for being four hours and very, very, very fucking retarded and run by the most ignorant teachers.

02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:05.360
Fuck you to whoever was in the car that drove by me and Owen last night after watching Catch Me If You Can yelling,

02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:07.960
eat shit and die, faggot, at me.

02:00:07.960 --> 02:00:10.600
Why were you at Saturday school, huh?

02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:11.720
What's up?

02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:12.760
Bad boy.

02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:15.080
Bad.

02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:17.000
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:18.280
Hey, get on with it, guys.

02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:23.080
Bombay, fuck you to Roseville Golf Land for getting extreme before Scandia and sucking.

02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:25.840
Bombay, fuck you and sucking. Good power.

02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:27.120
Hey.

02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:29.120
Hey, you apologize right now, sir.

02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:30.420
No, he knows I won't.

02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:31.120
Oh, okay.

02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:32.120
But not like that.

02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:36.620
VidPalace says, fuck you to restaurant customers who have 30 people in their party and only tip $1.

02:00:36.620 --> 02:00:38.120
Oh, ho, ho, that's rude.

02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:41.120
Because they supposedly only have enough money to pay the bill, but not enough to tip.

02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:43.120
That's why you're supposed to add the money on the bill.

02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:47.120
Actually, I thought that large parties over 15 and gratuity is supposed to be added.

02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:51.120
Yeah, I always thought that if you bring in a party to a restaurant with more than 8 people, gratuity is automatically added.

02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:52.120
That's what always happens to me.

02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:53.120
Yeah, what the fuck.

02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:55.120
Must be a Vegas thing.

02:00:55.120 --> 02:01:02.120
Fuck you to the WB for not re-showing Everward on their Easyview today, because that show is awesome.

02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:07.120
Actually, I saw the Easyview today. It was a small bill, I saw.

02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:16.120
Fuck you to not getting any free stuff at CES, fuck you to semester exams for being worth 20% of your semester grade, and yes, let's like to rave.

02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:22.120
Chubbs! Fuck you to being sick because it made my PA suck. Fuck you to Mr. Cool for being a douche.

02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:29.120
And last but not least, bug you to Orange Lounge for not interviewing me at Fremont.

02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:37.120
All I have to say to you is, cry a little more. I'm just kidding.

02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:48.120
Strasa says, private message to me. Angel says, fuck you to my co-worker for bitching over me getting her one dollar bill.

02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:55.120
getting her one dollar bill. It's just a dollar, bitch. Fuck you, fuck you in your ear, Jamie.

02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:59.600
You for that quote. Oh, thank you, Jamie, for that quote. Moving on. Vidpowah says they

02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:05.480
don't add to the tip because they're nice. Jamie, that's lovely. Now I've got to go to

02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:11.560
the email bag just for Muhimer's F.U. because he's the only one that sends me F.U.s over

02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:16.480
email. Muhimer says fuck me for always sending my fuck yous by email. Yes, you're in the

02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:19.840
chat room why do you use email oh well it's okay it's all good gives us an excuse to go

02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:25.600

02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:54.980
and they suck.

02:02:54.980 --> 02:03:00.860
Alright, with that ladies and gentlemen, we're done with the FUs of the week.

02:03:00.860 --> 02:03:03.180
Oh my god, that went for an hour.

02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:05.680
That was cool.

02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:09.280
This has been Anxed Hour on the Anxed Out Radio.

02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:11.260
And I'm spent.

02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:12.260
Back to sanity.

02:03:12.260 --> 02:03:13.260
Wow.

02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:14.260
Anxed?

02:03:14.260 --> 02:03:15.260
Same?

02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:20.660
Are we even going to do like a listless or anything like that?

02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:23.340
I don't know if we're going to have time because we got to do the cage match.

02:03:23.340 --> 02:03:25.980
We're going to come back and we're going to do the cage match.

02:03:25.980 --> 02:03:28.340
After the cage match, if we have time for a listless, we'll do one.

02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:32.980
If not, we dig that bit in the ground anyway, right?

02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:35.100
Do we have any ideas for a listless?

02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:36.740
We'll think about them over commercial.

02:03:36.740 --> 02:03:39.300
You shut up, look.

02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:42.100
In the meantime, more extreme shit.

02:03:42.100 --> 02:03:43.100
Enjoy.

02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:45.100
Play me after it's closed

02:04:13.100 --> 02:04:15.100
Over and over and over you

02:04:16.100 --> 02:04:18.100
I'd never get over you

02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:22.100
Over you, over you, over you

02:04:22.100 --> 02:04:24.100
Never over you

02:04:24.100 --> 02:04:26.100
For the sun will shine

02:04:26.100 --> 02:04:28.100
If you stay mine

02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:31.100
There could never be a cloudy day

02:04:31.100 --> 02:04:34.100
Shining, shining, shining through

02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:37.100
All the love that I feel for you

02:04:37.100 --> 02:04:40.100
I wish you would stay mine

02:04:40.100 --> 02:04:42.100
Until the end

02:04:42.100 --> 02:04:55.100
Oh, my love is flowing deeper, oh, my love is flowing deeper

02:04:55.100 --> 02:04:59.100
Father, son, for time, a new day will come

02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:05.100
Our love will keep on flowing, flowing and flowing, flowing through

02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:09.100
The love I'll always feel for you

02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:14.100
You will stay mine until the end of time

02:05:14.100 --> 02:05:16.100
Until the end of time

02:05:16.100 --> 02:05:22.100
Only for you until the end

02:05:52.100 --> 02:06:00.100
I want to take you home

02:06:00.100 --> 02:06:03.100
Freakin' heartache

02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:06.100
From the two of me

02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:09.100
I know you feel me

02:06:09.100 --> 02:06:13.100
I know

02:06:13.100 --> 02:06:16.100
Maybe, maybe, maybe you hide

02:06:16.100 --> 02:06:19.100
Maybe, maybe, maybe

02:06:19.100 --> 02:06:45.820
What's that party? What's that party? Go on get down.

02:06:45.820 --> 02:06:49.220
Oh, go with me, oh, go with me

02:06:49.220 --> 02:06:53.220
And I know

02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:56.220
The music makes you hot

02:06:56.220 --> 02:07:00.220
The music and the power

02:08:26.220 --> 02:08:35.220
We are what we're supposed to be

02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:38.220
Illusions on your fantasy

02:08:38.220 --> 02:08:40.220
All of the lies you seek or fake

02:08:40.220 --> 02:08:43.220
What you do is what you wish to do

02:08:43.220 --> 02:08:46.220
We are the God of Symphony

02:08:46.220 --> 02:08:48.220
We do the things you want to see

02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:51.220
Bring my friends to the extreme

02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:54.220
Our friends are so unreasonable

02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:57.220
Say to the unpredictable

02:08:57.220 --> 02:08:59.220
I doubt a lie if you speak and say

02:08:59.220 --> 02:09:03.220
What we do is what you wish to do

02:09:03.220 --> 02:09:05.220
That's all I know, best for our friends

02:09:05.220 --> 02:09:08.220
Showing off the little things

02:09:08.220 --> 02:09:10.220
Bring my friends to the extreme

02:09:10.220 --> 02:09:13.220
One by one, we make it in fun

02:09:13.220 --> 02:09:16.220
We are the central heroes of the world

02:09:16.220 --> 02:09:19.220
We are the ones who've got our hands on our back

02:09:19.220 --> 02:09:21.220
To stay by your back, raise your mind

02:09:21.220 --> 02:09:28.220
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute my girl from Mel B can join

02:09:51.220 --> 02:09:54.220
and join us on all the fun together.

02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:58.220
Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to

02:09:58.220 --> 02:10:03.220
and still the fun is just as great. It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

02:10:03.220 --> 02:10:09.220
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life aren't free.

02:10:09.220 --> 02:10:12.220
Yes, Irene has an important announcement.

02:10:12.220 --> 02:10:13.220
We're coming back from break.

02:10:13.220 --> 02:10:14.220
I paid off my debt.

02:10:14.220 --> 02:10:15.220
I hate you!

02:10:15.220 --> 02:10:16.220
I hate you.

02:10:16.220 --> 02:10:20.220
And so I'm going to get a two-story house before you...

02:10:20.220 --> 02:10:26.140
A cunt. A real fucking cunt, you know that? Why are you letting her be better than me

02:10:26.140 --> 02:10:33.140
at Animal Crossing? This sucks. Ow, ow, ow, ow, my tummy. I was just thinking of something.

02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:39.100
I paid off my house all the way. So did Dan. We have statues of ourselves.

02:10:39.100 --> 02:10:47.460
Well, you know what you and Dan are? Cool. Yeah, you're kind of cool. I was just thinking,

02:10:47.460 --> 02:10:52.660
I had a revelation. You know why Mel said that he was a broke-ass?

02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:53.660
Oh, in that commercial, yes.

02:10:53.660 --> 02:10:54.660
Because of DOC.

02:10:54.660 --> 02:10:56.740
Yeah, because of Derby Owners Club.

02:10:56.740 --> 02:10:58.500
And I'm addicted to it now.

02:10:58.500 --> 02:10:59.500
No, I actually...

02:10:59.500 --> 02:11:03.800
I've played one game, I have a horse, I want to play more!

02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:05.500
Labrador Lover.

02:11:05.500 --> 02:11:07.020
I can make a better name than that for anyone.

02:11:07.020 --> 02:11:15.140
The reason why Mel B. I had to play that promo is because they might be back at the end of

02:11:15.140 --> 02:11:19.420
the month, I know at least one of them is hopefully going to be coming up, Sharks Girl,

02:11:19.420 --> 02:11:25.540
the other half, might be bringing Mel B with her, might not, but either way we like Mel,

02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:27.620
so hopefully he'll be back at the show at some point.

02:11:27.620 --> 02:11:32.740
Also in the future, I've been promised a visit from Chubbs and Maple at some point, so I'm

02:11:32.740 --> 02:11:37.620
going to make them do that, and don't know what other guests we'll have on the show in

02:11:37.620 --> 02:11:38.620
the future.

02:11:38.620 --> 02:11:43.620
Let's get No Styling on Cory at the same time.

02:11:43.620 --> 02:11:45.620
No Stylin' on Cory Action?

02:11:45.620 --> 02:11:46.620
Oh!

02:11:46.620 --> 02:11:47.620
Alright.

02:11:47.620 --> 02:11:51.700
We need to get, we seriously need to get, um, Darkstone back up here.

02:11:51.700 --> 02:11:52.700
Yes.

02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:53.700
Oh!

02:11:53.700 --> 02:11:54.700
That reminds me!

02:11:54.700 --> 02:11:55.700
Thank you!

02:11:55.700 --> 02:12:01.140
Next week, I have a three-day weekend, which means I don't have to work on Monday, which

02:12:01.140 --> 02:12:04.340
means I can have a hangover if I want.

02:12:04.340 --> 02:12:05.880
Which means...

02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:11.580
Which means that since Shami never gets hangovers, she can drink all she wants to anyway.

02:12:11.580 --> 02:12:13.500
Next week, on Orange Lounge Radio...

02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:18.300

02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:48.480
I don't know, wine doesn't do anything to me.

02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:56.480
But you can make really good butterscotch milkshakes with Goldschlager.

02:12:56.480 --> 02:12:57.480
Really?

02:12:57.480 --> 02:12:58.480
Oh yeah.

It's cinnamon-y.

02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:01.480
You use butterscotch.

02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:03.480
That sounds good.

02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:06.480
Alright, so next week on Orange Lounge Radio, the Drunk Show.

02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:24.340
i wanted to uh...

02:15:24.340 --> 02:15:26.180
low-key sim update please

02:15:26.180 --> 02:15:30.180
all right

02:15:30.180 --> 02:15:34.180
Well, actually, I should say the end of last week was a big week.

02:15:34.180 --> 02:15:37.180
It was the Trinity Mix 3 results.

02:15:37.180 --> 02:15:43.180
And, well, you know, I hate you all for not playing my freaking file.

02:15:43.180 --> 02:15:45.180
You can burn in hell.

02:15:45.180 --> 02:15:47.180
Well, I'll say that for another day.

02:15:47.180 --> 02:15:52.180
So, anyways, we've got the results, the official and the public results for the voting.

02:15:52.180 --> 02:15:56.180
First place, there was a tie between spin and simple and clean.

02:15:56.180 --> 02:16:05.180
1. Invoke 2. Boom Boom Dollar

02:16:26.180 --> 02:16:28.880
First place for Heavy was Invoke.

02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:31.800
Second place was Stoic, done by Moogle Hunter.

02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:32.800
It's really crazy.

02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:33.800
Yay, Moogle, yay!

02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:38.020
Third place was Su-4, which is a remix of Volume 4 and Sagaru.

02:16:38.020 --> 02:16:43.300
It's kind of like Volume 4 with the Sagaru twanging in it.

02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:44.500
It was interesting.

02:16:44.500 --> 02:16:46.740
Standard, first place was Eat Em Up.

02:16:46.740 --> 02:16:55.980
It was a Pac-Man song from Ridge Racer Type 4, which you might be hearing later.

02:16:55.980 --> 02:17:04.800
Second place is Blue Fever, which is a speed mix of Blue by Eiffel65, and third place was

02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:05.800
Arian also.

02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:08.560
Oh my god, it's the Hidden Sevens Style song.

02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:10.200
You still have it unlocked.

02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:11.200
Guess what?

02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:15.000
Anyways, so, what do I have to say about this?

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Well, you know what?

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.320
I'm checking to see what place Loki got.

02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:20.440
I got like 18th or something.

02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:25.440
You got, uh, let's see, 40, yeah, where are they?

02:17:25.440 --> 02:17:26.440
Uh, keep going down.

02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:27.440
Wait, wait, wait, there it is.

02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:28.440
Oh, I got 50.

02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:29.440
50 out of 68.

02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:33.440
You were 50th out of 68 people.

02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:34.440
That's because...

02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:35.440
What the hell?

02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:36.440
Okay.

02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:37.440
What the hell?

02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:38.440
All right, let's see.

02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:41.440
You got beat by the theme of Strider Hyrule.

02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:42.440
Hyrule.

02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:45.440
First of all, Strider Hyrule is cool.

02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:50.940
Do you know what that, Strider, the best Capcom game ever are?

02:17:50.940 --> 02:17:58.940
Anyways, um, I basically, I have a song that basically sums up my feelings along with someone else's feelings about Tourney Mix 3, so um,

02:17:58.940 --> 02:18:05.940
Uh, if Rob, if you will do me the pleasure of, uh, playing an MP3 for me, Earth to Rob.

02:18:05.940 --> 02:18:08.940
I'm sorry, Jamie's yelling at me, because I made her cry.

02:18:08.940 --> 02:18:11.940
Well, sorry, um, could you play an MP3 for me?

02:18:11.940 --> 02:18:12.940
I suppose, what?

02:18:12.940 --> 02:18:14.940
I had an idea of that, like, way along with whatever song you wrote.

02:18:42.940 --> 02:18:47.020
and

02:18:47.020 --> 02:18:49.100
gave fire

02:18:49.100 --> 02:18:51.700
plays one

02:18:51.700 --> 02:18:54.700
this is my thoughts of turning mix

02:18:54.700 --> 02:19:01.700
uh...

02:19:02.220 --> 02:19:05.220
uh...

02:19:05.220 --> 02:19:08.220
uh...

02:19:08.220 --> 02:19:10.980
uh...

02:19:10.980 --> 02:19:13.980
So teach your name and sparkle to the deck, so give it one more try

02:19:13.980 --> 02:19:16.980
The cocksuckers will remember me from Ptolemy's school

02:19:16.980 --> 02:19:19.980
The guy who made that duke of your ideals, I will never do

02:19:19.980 --> 02:19:22.980
Just because you're an enemy is all the generic trans shit

02:19:22.980 --> 02:19:25.980
You show a rocker's book, that was a crazy fucking gift

02:19:25.980 --> 02:19:28.980
Well now I'm back to rock your world, my honest fucking life

02:19:28.980 --> 02:19:31.980
Why you pussies don't realize you needed to survive

02:19:31.980 --> 02:19:34.980
Trapped inside a tool and saved the secrets of the world

02:19:34.980 --> 02:19:37.980
A wonderful place to science, music are the magic meld

02:19:37.980 --> 02:19:40.640
All you motherfuckers want a job so rip the bar

02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:43.720
Bro fuck you or fuck your mum, go back to Ulala

02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:46.800
But if you got an ounce of sense then stay and fucking lose it

02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:49.720
Life doesn't happen all at once so why'd you fucking use it?

02:19:49.720 --> 02:19:52.680
Mr. Carlos' arrows fill the screen, you're probably all just thinking

02:19:52.680 --> 02:19:55.680
On the way to this my lead is working, set my spirits sinking

02:19:55.680 --> 02:19:58.600
Well come on these fuckers here's bad news, I don't give a shit

02:19:58.600 --> 02:20:01.720
So take this fucking freeze arrow and ram it up your clip

02:20:01.720 --> 02:20:04.520
All these shames would want to do is show you the meaning of life

02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:07.560
Maybe you'll just throw it back at me, you had a sharp knife

02:20:07.560 --> 02:20:10.560
Well, I'm not wasting any time on shit like you and I'll fucking tell you why

02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:13.560
I don't want you to find happiness in your life, I want you to rather die

02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:16.560
Fucking stitch my heart, go word, it's on the yokey stick

02:20:16.560 --> 02:20:19.560
It's taught a mix, you go to hell, that service is a brick

02:20:19.560 --> 02:20:22.560
So all you arses can go back to your faggot little dunce

02:20:22.560 --> 02:20:25.560
DJ Damien signing out, you motherfucking nuts

02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:35.560
That made Captain Jack fart

02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:47.560
And for those who didn't know, that was DJ Damien with Art 2. He did a really shitty entry the first Turning Mix 2, and he did a really shitty entry for Turning Mix 3, but you know what? That song is funny.

02:20:47.560 --> 02:21:02.560
Basically, the fault I have to say in this, and a lot of people have problems, is there are so many files entered. Obviously, I'm not surprised that I didn't get picked as far as voting goes, because people have to play like freaking a hundred files.

02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:06.920
files and that's just unreasonable. I mean, to even expect people to play all the files.

02:21:06.920 --> 02:21:12.360
So, it's kind of unfair there because everyone that wasn't known didn't get their files played.

02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:17.400
So, you know, that kind of sucks but whatever, you know, I could do it better so I probably

02:21:17.400 --> 02:21:25.240
will. As far as sim stuff goes, my new site is actually sort of online right now. I'm

02:21:25.240 --> 02:21:29.880
uploading pages and content later on this week. I've sent out emails, a mass email to

02:21:29.880 --> 02:21:35.120
a bunch of different people at Simfile Creators out there. And so far I've only gotten one

02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:38.440
response back. So I'm sending out another email to you guys and it's going to basically

02:21:38.440 --> 02:21:42.480
be if you don't send me back an email, I'm getting an okay to put your files on my site.

02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:47.060
So if you don't want that happening, you better send me a fucking email. So my site's coming

02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:55.060
up. The URL for it is going to be www.willddrforfood.net slash leachfromloki. And there's already a

02:21:55.060 --> 02:21:59.480
main page up there right now but of course none of the links work because I haven't uploaded

02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:04.680
anything else yet. So, you can check that out right now and there should be more stuff

02:22:04.680 --> 02:22:10.840
coming up later this week. I'm shooting for the early part of this week, but I don't know.

02:22:10.840 --> 02:22:16.760
We'll see. And I'll be offering, there'll be places, an actual script where you can

02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:21.100
upload your own files and even at your own page with your own files on it if you want

02:22:21.100 --> 02:22:24.800
or else I'll make you a page. Basically, we're just going to have the largest collection

02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:29.920
of stuff on there. So, basically, you know, you'll see that there's going to be...

02:22:29.920 --> 02:22:32.920
Do you have crap like that one in your collection too?

02:22:32.920 --> 02:22:37.800
Why not? Some people want to play that. So, maybe we'll put that in a section of files

02:22:37.800 --> 02:22:43.000
that suck or something like that. I don't know. It really doesn't matter to me. So,

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:47.640
other than that, let's see. I think I'm going to have, there's going to be some interviews

02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:50.920
with Simfile Creators and we're going to do like some themes or releases and that kind

02:22:50.920 --> 02:22:55.360
thing so it'll be fun to watch and you'll see there's already a group of

02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:59.520
people baumannysims.com that's sort of doing the same similar thing that I think

02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:03.000
they've beat me to it because you know they put their site up first but site

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:07.400
looks like shit and they don't really have that much right now but we're gonna

02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:12.000
be strong battle lines yeah we're gonna see way do you see like a thousand files

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:18.720
come online just all of a sudden so you know take that and whatever and uh take

02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:25.200
up your clit. Alright, we need to get to the cage match because we got to get that done

02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:30.160
definitely. That's one segment we have to do each week. Last week in the Orange Launch

02:23:30.160 --> 02:23:37.440
cage match we had Yumi Hamasaki won for the second week in a row with Connected and I'll

02:23:37.440 --> 02:23:40.800
play a clip of that in the second. First, I'm going to explain the cage match for you guys.

02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:45.840
This is when we take three songs, we battle them against each other, you guys vote on your favorite

02:23:45.840 --> 02:23:51.080
And the winner goes into rotation during the Bomani Music Amore program, which plays 24

02:23:51.080 --> 02:23:54.720
hours a day on this station when we're not here.

02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:58.280
So let's hear a clip of last week's winner.

02:23:58.280 --> 02:24:00.960
We're not going to play the full song, although you can still vote for it.

02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:04.960
And if it does win this week, it gets retired next week, because we'll have won for a month

02:24:04.960 --> 02:24:06.000
straight.

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.560
This is Ayumi Hamasaki with Connected, last week's winner.

02:24:38.560 --> 02:25:06.080
Alright, that's Yumi Yamasaki with Connected, that's your first candidate in the Orange

02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:08.080
Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match

02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:37.080
Eggman

02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:40.080

02:28:32.180 --> 02:28:36.220
Ad mayo't

02:28:36.220 --> 02:28:39.440
Ad mayo't

02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:42.880
Ad mayo't

02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:46.220
Ad mayo't

02:28:46.220 --> 02:28:49.640
Ad mayo't

02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:51.740
Aaaaaaa

02:28:51.740 --> 02:28:58.740
the

02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:02.360
world's it was going to the next one there so I'm gonna get the first time

02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:05.800
I was too busy telling not not jokes this car room

02:29:05.800 --> 02:29:08.980
I'll feedback on that a

02:29:08.980 --> 02:29:12.000
pac-man what is not you my I affects with

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:16.000
I like it

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:19.160
it was like a really bad I nightmare warm water

02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:26.160
there

02:29:27.120 --> 02:29:29.480
where your music

02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:31.720
uh... no i didn't like it very much right

02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:34.720
i mean if it's one of the really cool but

02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:36.840
it's always just really repetitive

02:29:36.840 --> 02:29:41.160
so i'll give it

02:29:41.160 --> 02:29:43.720
here

02:29:43.720 --> 02:29:47.720
i would

02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:50.720
fact

02:29:50.720 --> 02:29:54.240
yes i think what you're going to think it's playing in my direction

02:29:54.240 --> 02:29:57.920
and i don't care

02:29:57.920 --> 02:29:59.040
uh...

02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:01.960
who's like

02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:06.480
yeah i would

02:30:06.480 --> 02:30:12.480
I just had a ferret hit me in the face.

02:30:12.480 --> 02:30:16.480
Let's see, the song, I'll probably give it an 8.5 out of 10. It's a pretty good song.

02:30:16.480 --> 02:30:22.980
It's a pretty good song, but for some reason, I feel like Ayumi better for some reason.

02:30:22.980 --> 02:30:25.180
But this song's pretty classic, though.

02:30:25.180 --> 02:30:27.780
They could've done a little better, but it's pretty good.

02:30:27.780 --> 02:30:32.880
I give it a 7, because I think that's about the highest stage I ever got to on Pac-Man.

02:30:32.880 --> 02:30:36.880
All right, next up, Blokey, tell us about the other songs in the cage match.

02:30:36.880 --> 02:30:40.880
The next one, you might remember her stuff from DR Max 2.

02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:43.520
She did the song today, this is Tesla Confusion.

02:31:10.880 --> 02:31:38.240
I don't know what I'm gonna do to make you see that I'm free

02:31:38.240 --> 02:31:41.740
I'm free to say, I'm free to leave, I'm free to do what I feel

02:31:41.740 --> 02:31:45.240
But I'm not sure if what I want, I need to take it over

02:31:45.240 --> 02:31:48.240
When you're away, I feel confused

02:32:48.240 --> 02:32:53.240
I want to be beside you, I want to say you're on my knees I want to know what you feel

02:32:53.240 --> 02:32:59.240
You need to know when you're around that there's a cure but later when you're away I feel from you

02:33:23.240 --> 02:33:28.240
p0k3smot42o muhaha

02:33:28.240 --> 02:33:53.120
Oh, uh, woah, hello, that's the wrong one, my bad.

02:33:53.120 --> 02:33:55.240
Uh, that was Test with Confusion.

02:33:55.240 --> 02:34:02.240
and

02:34:03.560 --> 02:34:10.560
on a scale of 110

02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:14.000
i like it

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:17.920
and no i don't think my songs pretty mixed three at

02:34:17.920 --> 02:34:19.760
the full version

02:34:19.760 --> 02:34:21.480
not a cut-down version

02:34:21.480 --> 02:34:25.360
But yes, I do pick my music files from my Sim collection.

02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:28.720
See, we're close. I give you half a point.

02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:31.380
But, uh, I'll give it a nine.

02:34:31.380 --> 02:34:32.960
Uh, let's see, um...

02:34:32.960 --> 02:34:34.640
It was better than the Pac-Man song.

02:34:34.640 --> 02:34:37.880
I... I...

02:34:37.880 --> 02:34:41.880
And Jamie, stay over here kicking me on the floor.

02:34:41.880 --> 02:34:43.440
Yeah, she's doing it as a dick. Ow!

02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:45.040
Don't...

02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:47.120
You're beating me up. Um...

02:34:47.120 --> 02:34:51.000
Yeah, uh... I give it an eight and a half.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
You need to do that more often.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
I think that sounds very great.

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
What, you like me kicking you?

02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:00.000
The scores are probably good, there's a...

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
9.8 out of 10.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
You need to kick people more often, not me.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
It's gonna be a very good battle, but some person...

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
And why did you...

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:11.000
Jimmy just took my hat off and put it on Rob.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
I also prefer Ayumi for a while.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
Ooh, a chick fight.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:16.000
TNA.

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
What the hell are you talking about?

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
Yes, versus Ayumi.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:37.240
I thought it was pretty groovy. I also, I also give that song a seven. Okay. So anyway,

02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:42.560
you can vote for, you can send in your votes now. Send them as a private message to me

02:35:42.560 --> 02:35:49.480
in the chat room right now. You can vote for Connected by Ayumi Masamasaki. You can vote

02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:29.480
So now, instead of going back to break, since we just played some music, you have to send me PMs so they don't count. Don't type them in the main channel because I don't count them there.

02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:34.480
So, uh, explicit's given a kick out of just reading you people in the chatroom.

02:36:34.480 --> 02:36:39.480
Um, black-eyed, did you have something you wanted to say?

02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:42.480
I have the microphone right now, I figured you had something you wanted to say.

02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:47.480
Why? My hat does not look dumb.

02:36:47.480 --> 02:36:52.480
Oh, I'm cool, because I wear my hat backwards.

02:36:52.480 --> 02:36:53.480
Yeah.

02:36:53.480 --> 02:36:59.880
Anyway, did we figure out if we can do our segment that we wanted to do?

02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:03.480
I mean, I've got, I can talk about something, man.

02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:04.480
Okay, great.

02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:11.000
Then we're going to talk about, we're going to introduce a new segment on this big show.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:15.920
It's time everybody, sit around, bring in the family, sit around the radio, get the

02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:21.200
kids in, tuck them into bed, because it's time for a new segment on Orange Lawns.

02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:24.080
Now we kind of did this a while ago, except it wasn't an official segment.

02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:27.920
You might remember a few weeks ago, I don't remember what episode number it is, but maybe

02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:31.440
somebody like Angel, who knows, she knows this show in and out, she's very smart when

02:37:31.440 --> 02:37:34.920
it comes to this show, she might remember what episode number this was, when Loki talked

02:37:34.920 --> 02:37:37.760
about his experience with the Hooker.

02:37:37.760 --> 02:37:40.920
I don't remember what episode that was, but, was it 20?

02:37:40.920 --> 02:37:43.360
Oh, Black Lab, that was when he was here, it was 20.

02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:46.320
Okay, in episode twenty you talked about the black lab, er,

02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:50.140
I didn't talk about the hooker who was named Black Lab, no. She was black though, wait.

02:37:50.140 --> 02:37:54.540
Anyway, so we thought we'd make a whole segment out of this in the future. Ladies and gentlemen,

02:37:54.540 --> 02:38:00.120
give it up for Storytime with Loki.

02:38:00.120 --> 02:38:01.880
Alright, so, uh...

02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:04.960
Hold on, I'm sorry, I have to bring in your music, Loki.

02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:09.120
So what are you going to be telling us the story about tonight? Well, I'm going to talk about the time

02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:14.440
that I went to goth night at the rage in sacramento's club that we've got down here and you know

02:38:14.440 --> 02:38:19.680
me kind of you know really I don't get out that much but when I do it's just weird shit

02:38:19.680 --> 02:38:24.160
that happens so that's why we have you know story time so this is about like I went to

02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:31.440
goth night well let me let me introduce this okay all right so before I was dating my girlfriend

02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:36.940
right now. Um, I was dating this other girl who, um, her name was Forest. Um, she was

02:38:36.940 --> 02:38:44.640
a cr- No, she was not dark black. Well, well, I'm not going to comp- Well, yeah, okay. The

02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:48.160
forest was very thick, but that's not what I'm going to talk about here. Okay, so basically

02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:53.360
we were going out and she was turning into Jesus Freak that she is now. Um, so before

02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:57.300
that I was talking with this one girl who used to, you know, she was really had like

02:38:57.300 --> 02:39:01.060
a crush thing on me all throughout high school and I just kind of ignored it. I didn't really

02:39:01.060 --> 02:39:15.060
I don't care, but we were talking and stuff, and she wanted to go out to this club, but it was late at night, and she had no one to drive her, so I was like, oh, I'll take you down there, because I've never been there, and it sounded like fun, it sounded different, so we went to Goth Night down at the Rage.

02:39:15.060 --> 02:39:33.060
So I get there, and there's like these really freaky people, okay? I mean, never have I seen so many drag queens and like people doing goth shit and stuff like that in my entire life, but it was fun because I like the music, I like industrial, and that kind of thing. They had K.M.F.D.M. and, you know, Rammstein, that kind of shit, so that was pretty cool.

02:39:33.060 --> 02:39:56.060
This girl was really hot. She was nice. So we go there and I'm meeting all these weird people. There's this guy wearing a corset and she was commenting on his corset and asking her where he got it and that kind of thing.

02:39:56.060 --> 02:40:23.060
But the really weird thing that happened to me that night is we were talking with her friend, one of her gay friends, I can't remember, I think his name was Thomas, yeah, gay friend Thomas, and now she was kind of, you know, hanging on me and stuff and all that kind of thing, and we were talking with him and stuff, and then her, his friend, also gay, was, you know, kind of eyeing me up and shit.

02:40:23.060 --> 02:40:40.060
And so I was like, kind of, okay, what's going on here? And so there, you know, you're talking, and then I guess Thomas goes and talks to his friend, and comes back, he's like, my friend has made an interesting proposition, and I think he'd like to hear it. I'm like, okay.

02:40:40.060 --> 02:40:44.060
Um, he wants to know if you'd be willing to go home with him tonight.

02:40:44.060 --> 02:40:49.060
I'm like, hell no! No, wait! Sorry, don't swing that way.

02:40:49.060 --> 02:40:53.060
And he's all, no, really, it's, uh, then, you know, Thomas is like, no, really, it's good.

02:40:53.060 --> 02:40:58.060
You know, I've done it before. I'm like, no. And no, no.

02:40:58.060 --> 02:41:01.060
So basically, she was, like, acting like my pimp that night.

02:41:01.060 --> 02:41:03.060
I don't know. It was kind of weird.

02:41:03.060 --> 02:41:05.060
It was kind of cool, though, because she was hanging out with me and she's, you know,

02:41:05.060 --> 02:41:14.360
She was an exotic dancer once, and it was really sweet because she had piercings in

02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:17.200
all the right places, except she wouldn't pierce the boys.

02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:20.780
She didn't want to pierce her nipples, but she had piercings in other places.

02:41:20.780 --> 02:41:23.200
I kept trying to get her to show me her piercings, but she wouldn't.

02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:24.200
She was kind of shy.

02:41:24.200 --> 02:41:26.200
She also had pictures, too.

02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:28.460
Is she shy?

02:41:28.460 --> 02:41:29.460
I know.

02:41:29.460 --> 02:41:30.460
I know.

02:41:30.460 --> 02:41:39.460
She's also taking pictures with her just wearing caution tape, and then the caution tape being heated up a little bit so that it's form-fitting.

02:41:39.460 --> 02:41:43.460
I wanted to see that. That was kind of cool, but no.

02:41:43.460 --> 02:41:46.460
Let's see, other than that...

02:41:46.460 --> 02:41:51.460
Oh, this story kind of sucks. I had something really last night that was funny, and this is why we were going through the whole segment.

02:41:51.460 --> 02:41:57.460
But unfortunately, I didn't record what I wanted to actually talk about today.

02:41:57.460 --> 02:42:02.460
Let's see here. I can do the strip club story.

02:42:02.460 --> 02:42:07.460
Okay.

02:42:07.460 --> 02:42:12.460
Alright, well, real quick strip club story. Now there's some strippers that really kind of scare me.

02:42:12.460 --> 02:42:17.460
There's this one chick, you know, she comes up, I'm at the bar there,

02:42:17.460 --> 02:42:22.460
you've got my dollar bills down shit, she comes to rub her tits in my face, and that's kind of cool.

02:42:22.460 --> 02:42:23.400
capital

02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:26.600
but when she does it though it's like

02:42:26.600 --> 02:42:30.100
that's good shit i mean i was like i wasn't prepared for that she had a

02:42:30.100 --> 02:42:32.340
well what the fuck you see with

02:42:32.340 --> 02:42:36.600
is with most annoying high-pitched voice that you can ever imagine

02:42:36.600 --> 02:42:37.600
it was

02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:38.500
the

02:42:38.500 --> 02:42:43.500
sound of the world

02:42:43.500 --> 02:42:48.500
the

02:42:48.500 --> 02:42:53.420
Anyways, so yeah, that was scary.

02:42:53.420 --> 02:42:59.600
We're going to be doing another strip-flip trip, though, pretty soon, though, because my friend's getting married, and I know he's going to be throwing a bachelor party, plus next week we're talking about going...

02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:01.220
My girlfriend's going to strip-flip!

02:43:01.220 --> 02:43:04.280
She's going to strip-flip at the end of the month with her friends, and supposedly

02:43:04.280 --> 02:43:06.020
at Centerfolds,

02:43:06.020 --> 02:43:07.620
I guess they do

02:43:07.620 --> 02:43:09.780
full-nude strip-flips, or

02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:11.620
guy-stripping, full-nude.

02:43:11.620 --> 02:43:13.260
I never knew that.

02:43:13.260 --> 02:43:17.140
I'm there. You gotta get tickets in advance, though, so it's eight dollars to go in.

02:43:17.140 --> 02:43:26.140
But she's going with her friend and a couple of her friends, and they're going to do that, and they're going to buy each other lap dances. So that's kind of cool.

02:43:26.140 --> 02:43:30.140
But I want to definitely hit up the strip club again, because it's fun.

02:43:30.140 --> 02:43:37.140
Yeah, centerfolds, they have actually, Gold Club centerfolds, they've got their own actual forums. It's kind of funny watching people post in there.

02:43:37.140 --> 02:43:42.140
I went to the Gold Club centerfold forums the other day. I don't remember why. I was talking to a friend online about them.

02:43:42.140 --> 02:43:46.140
And um, yeah, they were interesting stuff. That's all.

02:44:12.140 --> 02:44:16.420
you know, it'll cost you half as much in each, you know, to go in there. So, okay, yeah,

02:44:16.420 --> 02:44:21.540
we'll do that. So, we go in there and basically the shower room is like this kind of large

02:44:21.540 --> 02:44:25.640
communal shower thing. They've got these two chicks, you know, totally naked in there.

02:44:25.640 --> 02:44:30.100
And they've got their sprayed whipped cream or not, yeah, like shaving cream all over

02:44:30.100 --> 02:44:34.380
their bodies. Well, the shower room, what you can do is you can put dollar bills in

02:44:34.380 --> 02:44:38.700
your hand and you can basically touch them all over their body wherever you want. Well,

02:44:38.700 --> 02:44:43.700
And so as long as you have a dollar bill in your hand, you can keep putting dollars on them and stuff.

02:44:43.700 --> 02:44:48.700
And then they started getting a little bit more freakier, and then they started going down on each other and shit in there.

02:44:48.700 --> 02:44:53.700
I mean, I didn't know this kind of stuff happened in strip clubs, but I guess it does.

02:44:53.700 --> 02:44:57.700
And then they had, um, if you paid $20, they would sit on your face.

02:44:57.700 --> 02:44:58.700
But you just had to-

02:44:58.700 --> 02:45:09.700
But you just have to keep your mouth shut.

02:45:09.700 --> 02:45:16.700
So I guess it looks for the people with really big noses.

02:45:16.700 --> 02:45:19.700
Look, I'm going there!

02:45:19.700 --> 02:45:35.700
So, yeah, it was very interesting. The only thing I regret is because it was such a large group, I couldn't really get to the front of the line to, like, you know, be able to put dollar bills on, you know, Naked Chick's breast, but it was fun while it lasted. I mean, I don't know, it was interesting.

02:45:35.700 --> 02:45:43.700
You know, I'm getting in so much trouble for this because the last time that I talked about weird shit like this, my girlfriend was bored and decided to listen to this show.

02:45:43.700 --> 02:45:52.840
I love you, you're listening. Yeah, she does all this weird shit that we've done. I mean,

02:45:52.840 --> 02:45:57.140
Lisa, I'm not like my friends who go and get, you know, the VIP room dances and get head

02:45:57.140 --> 02:46:01.720
in there. I mean, so, and this, okay, if for all the people that are visiting Rancho Cordova,

02:46:01.720 --> 02:46:08.560
this is Gold Club Centerfolds off of Folsom Boulevard. Do check it out. Yeah, that's all.

02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:11.560
That's my story.

02:46:11.560 --> 02:46:13.720
I like cheese.

02:46:13.720 --> 02:46:18.080
Irene's playing Animal Crossing.

02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:28.380
I'm going to have to do some more interesting weird shit in order to come up with stories, or start digging back into my past, because I've done a lot of awkward, weird shit before, and I'm sure, you know, they'll come up.

02:46:28.380 --> 02:46:33.320
Well, you know what? For next week, that's your homework. You know, go find a funny story in your life and write it down.

02:46:33.320 --> 02:46:38.320
I'm going to start a Paypal account. It's Loki's go to strip club fun account.

02:46:38.320 --> 02:46:41.320
You never know, it might work.

02:46:41.320 --> 02:46:44.320
Jamie, you want to announce the winner of this week's cage match?

02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:47.320
Um, here's a quarter, Matt.

02:46:47.320 --> 02:46:52.320
Woohoo! First donation to your strip club needs.

02:46:52.320 --> 02:46:54.320
Oh, here we go!

02:46:54.320 --> 02:46:55.320
Okay.

02:46:55.320 --> 02:46:57.320
And, guess what?

02:46:57.320 --> 02:46:59.320
Fuck everybody because I win.

02:46:59.320 --> 02:47:02.320
That's because everyone's whipped to Jamie.

02:47:02.320 --> 02:47:04.320
Just cause you all love me.

02:47:04.320 --> 02:47:08.320
Yeah, it's probably all the people that listen to her F.U. shows all the time.

02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:10.320
You're all nerds like me.

02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:12.320
And the winner is me!

02:47:12.320 --> 02:47:15.320
Oh, I'm sorry, Aphex Twin, and Eat'em Up.

02:47:15.320 --> 02:47:18.320
Yeah, cause I'm cool.

02:47:18.320 --> 02:47:21.320
Bless all of you people who are old school like me.

02:47:21.320 --> 02:47:23.320
Not much to say, Jamie.

02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:25.320
I'm gonna kick you again.

02:47:25.320 --> 02:47:27.320
I'm gonna kick you again.

02:47:27.320 --> 02:47:31.320
No, she's got my dog! Give it back! Give it back! No!

02:47:31.320 --> 02:47:36.220
I just ate a little dog with the microphone don't do that again

02:47:36.840 --> 02:47:38.840
Wipe it off on Rob

02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:42.860
Okay, we're gonna take really quick break like one or two song break

02:47:42.860 --> 02:47:47.720
We're gonna come back to wrap up this big train wreck of a show so stay with us. Won't you won't you be my neighbor?

02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:51.200
And we'll be back

02:47:55.360 --> 02:47:58.680
Let's do I want to play something we play one of mine, yes

02:47:58.680 --> 02:48:00.680
I'll start with this song and then we'll do one of yours, okay?

02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:01.180
Okay.

02:48:01.180 --> 02:48:08.180
back

02:49:01.180 --> 02:49:24.180
I can't wait to see you in the next video!

02:49:24.180 --> 02:49:27.420
Loki's going to introduce this next song for us because it's special.

02:49:27.420 --> 02:49:28.420
Okay.

02:49:28.420 --> 02:49:29.420
Special ed.

02:49:29.420 --> 02:49:33.300
for every for all those people out there that are thinking

02:49:33.300 --> 02:49:36.060
it would be a really great idea to mix max three hundred with

02:49:36.060 --> 02:49:40.180
name of baumanni song or any song that's in the whole baumanni series

02:49:40.180 --> 02:49:44.100
um... here's why you shouldn't do that

02:49:44.100 --> 02:49:51.100
Is this going to sound like a... never mind, I'm not going to say it on air.

02:50:44.100 --> 02:50:57.020
Enos,

02:50:57.720 --> 02:50:59.160
Blackfeet, Pogo.

02:50:59.160 --> 02:51:28.240
Let's listen in on an

02:51:28.240 --> 02:51:35.240
Orange Lounge Radio Staff Meeting

02:51:45.400 --> 02:51:47.600
Extreme Bamani Radio

02:51:47.600 --> 02:51:50.600
That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

02:51:50.600 --> 02:51:52.600
Dot, dot, dot.

02:51:53.600 --> 02:51:56.600
Jamie's twitching. She went into a coma. That song killed her.

02:51:58.600 --> 02:52:02.600
Let's just say that song fucking sucks.

02:52:02.600 --> 02:52:04.600
We're gonna remix this because they have some lessons a little bit.

02:52:04.600 --> 02:52:05.600
I'm having a...

02:52:05.600 --> 02:52:06.600
I could just remix better than that.

02:52:06.600 --> 02:52:08.600
I have had a cry.

02:52:08.600 --> 02:52:11.600
How much of this life is worse than Max Dinosaur?

02:52:11.600 --> 02:52:12.600
Oh god, I heard that.

02:52:12.600 --> 02:52:15.600
It sounded. It sounded.

02:52:15.600 --> 02:52:17.600
You know what it sounded like?

02:52:17.600 --> 02:52:18.600
Burning?

02:52:18.600 --> 02:52:19.600
A twin mix.

02:52:19.600 --> 02:52:22.600
Well, actually, later on, uh...

02:52:22.600 --> 02:52:23.600
Sing for that one!

02:52:23.600 --> 02:52:25.600
I've got something else that you guys might like.

02:52:25.600 --> 02:52:28.600
Well, anyways, that was a light entry in Turning Mix 3.

02:52:28.600 --> 02:52:31.600
This is all the shit that was cluttering up, you know, the song list

02:52:31.600 --> 02:52:34.600
that the reason my entry didn't get played.

02:52:34.600 --> 02:52:38.600
I should have put my entry as the name of the game, Max300,

02:52:38.600 --> 02:52:40.600
and it'd be like, oh, Max300, I'm gonna play that.

02:52:40.600 --> 02:52:41.600
You know, so...

02:52:41.600 --> 02:52:42.600
Frickin' A.

02:52:42.600 --> 02:52:43.600
Okay.

02:52:43.600 --> 02:52:44.600
Oh.

02:52:44.600 --> 02:52:47.280
Okay, let me call numbers.

02:52:47.280 --> 02:52:52.200
But yeah, there's a bunch of horrible shit out there.

02:52:52.200 --> 02:52:54.440
Helium Era is a good example.

02:52:54.440 --> 02:53:00.720
I've got another one that's Max 300, the Positive Reversal, some remix.

02:53:00.720 --> 02:53:02.480
It's Max 300 backwards.

02:53:02.480 --> 02:53:03.480
It's really shitty.

02:53:03.480 --> 02:53:07.560
And then there's another one that's, we might be playing later, Max Doctor?

02:53:07.560 --> 02:53:08.560
No.

02:53:08.560 --> 02:53:09.560
Oh, what the hell?

02:53:09.560 --> 02:53:10.560
Hell no.

02:53:10.560 --> 02:53:11.560
Hell no.

02:53:11.560 --> 02:53:12.560
Hell no.

02:53:12.560 --> 02:53:16.560
I'm gonna read it into the lounge soon.

02:53:16.560 --> 02:53:21.560
But, um, yeah, well, hmm. I've got some more stuff, though.

02:53:21.560 --> 02:53:23.560
Plenty of horrible sound files.

02:53:23.560 --> 02:53:26.560
That was very homoerotic, though, that song.

02:53:26.560 --> 02:53:30.560
I would like to state, uh, Politary, I believe, has been banned from Orange Islands for a little while.

02:53:30.560 --> 02:53:36.560
Although, we, her good songs, we accept, we let them through, like, you know, uh, memories, memories and, uh, you know, me.

02:53:36.560 --> 02:53:37.560
That's pretty good.

02:53:37.560 --> 02:53:41.560
We let those, we let those through. I don't know, there was another one that we let through, I thought it was that one.

02:53:41.560 --> 02:53:45.560
Anyway, but that song? That song's banned for ten years, from Orange Islands Radio.

02:53:45.560 --> 02:53:49.560
Let's just ban all Max 300, anything with Max 300 in it.

02:53:49.560 --> 02:53:55.560
Okay, anything that is not Konami produced with Max in the title is now banned from this station.

02:53:55.560 --> 02:53:56.560
Word.

02:53:56.560 --> 02:54:04.560
No, any Max that sucks, because there's some pretty good Max files, but Max dinosaur, Max, whatever that title is.

02:54:04.560 --> 02:54:11.560
Actually, there's been, okay, I've seen one really good, actually two very good mixes with Max in it.

02:54:11.560 --> 02:54:21.200
in it. There was Max Resurrection, that was really good. It's on Simply Retarded, it's

02:54:21.200 --> 02:54:26.560
on their site. But then there's also one that was Dropout 300, that was really good.

02:54:26.560 --> 02:54:30.200
I thought of another one that's actually okay, Piano Max Unlimited, that was cool.

02:54:30.200 --> 02:54:39.960
Oh yeah, that right there was STM, he was the guy that actually, a long time ago. Now

02:54:39.960 --> 02:54:46.480
Now if you remember, now they have that musician's trial thing right now for 2DX9 style or whatever.

02:54:46.480 --> 02:54:51.680
They did a similar thing back in the day for 4th style, and they also did it for 5th mix.

02:54:51.680 --> 02:54:55.200
5th mix, the winner of it was Paranoid Eternal, and that was done by E.M.

02:54:55.200 --> 02:54:59.680
STM did another, he has a bunch of music files he's done.

02:54:59.680 --> 02:55:06.040
In fact, Virtu Corey released, what was it, there was a Trip Machine strange mix that

02:55:06.040 --> 02:55:10.040
It was floating around in the net and people thought it was Trip Machine Survivor.

02:55:10.040 --> 02:55:12.040
That was hilarious.

02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:18.040
So that was going around, but that was actually a remix done by that guy, STM.

02:55:18.040 --> 02:55:24.040
And he actually, you know, he was one of the lucky ones that actually got an actual song in DDR.

02:55:24.040 --> 02:55:29.040
Yeah, it's in Xtreme now, so go play his remix and it's actually pretty good.

02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:31.040
What's your favorite part of the song?

02:55:59.040 --> 02:56:03.520
Next week worst like the cage worst or something. I don't know

02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:11.040
We should do one. We should do one. We're like only one song. You know survives and the rest get dumped off the playlist

02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:13.800
All right

02:56:13.800 --> 02:56:18.320
What we could do is like we'll have like a turn it like a cage match tournament of all the worst songs

02:56:18.520 --> 02:56:23.560
And all the ones that get that and all the songs except for the winner will get put under a CD

02:56:23.560 --> 02:56:33.560
I know it would win the losing. Let them move.

02:56:33.560 --> 02:56:36.560
No, no, no. Oh, what do you mean, win the losing?

02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:39.560
Max for you. Max for you.

02:56:39.560 --> 02:57:00.560
There's a bunch of Omani remixes out there that are official on DanceMania. There's one I've got on my CD here, it's Candy the Planet Remix.

02:57:00.560 --> 02:57:10.560
The one that's out right now for people who are playing in DDR Extreme, there's Burning The Floor and MomoMix.

02:57:30.560 --> 02:57:36.560
I've got a Let Them Move remix on that CD that's really, really bad.

02:57:36.560 --> 02:57:40.560
Imagine Let Them Move and Max 300 mixed together.

02:57:40.560 --> 02:57:42.560
It's been done.

02:57:42.560 --> 02:57:45.560
There's this guy, Twin, who used to be in our chat room.

02:57:45.560 --> 02:57:48.560
He used to do Let Them Move remixes all the time.

02:57:48.560 --> 02:57:49.560
Final thought, Dave?

02:57:49.560 --> 02:57:50.560
Final thought?

02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:52.560
Final thought.

02:57:52.560 --> 02:57:54.560
I need to play DDR Extreme.

02:57:54.560 --> 02:57:56.560
And I will pass V.

02:57:56.560 --> 02:58:03.560
or not at Roosevelt-Goughland.

02:58:26.560 --> 02:58:28.560
They'd be going to the bathroom so badly.

02:58:30.060 --> 02:58:33.060
Well, that's like one of the worst songs ever, how can I think of?

02:58:35.560 --> 02:58:37.560
Or just get some damn lessons, or something.

02:58:38.060 --> 02:58:40.060
And end up with a waksa wakla, or...

02:58:41.060 --> 02:58:45.060
Max for you, or whatever the damn thing people are talking about on the internet.

02:58:46.560 --> 02:58:49.560
Unless if it's very good, you can give it to me and I'll see, I'll rate it.

02:58:52.060 --> 02:58:55.560
And Scania should get New York Streams soon.

02:58:55.560 --> 02:58:59.560
It's on its way, and I can't wait till it comes.

02:58:59.560 --> 02:59:02.560
Alright, Black Lab, final thought.

02:59:02.560 --> 02:59:05.560
Derby Owners Club is my new crack.

02:59:05.560 --> 02:59:10.560
I have to go play it next time I go back to the Bay Area, which hopefully will be soon.

02:59:10.560 --> 02:59:14.560
But now I gotta get a job so I can blow money on DOC. I'm sad.

02:59:14.560 --> 02:59:16.560
You could blow so you can blow.

02:59:16.560 --> 02:59:18.560
No!

02:59:18.560 --> 02:59:21.560
I... Don't bring that up again!

02:59:21.560 --> 02:59:23.560
Again?

02:59:23.560 --> 02:59:25.560
Brad, final thought?

02:59:25.560 --> 02:59:27.560
All your fried chicken are blowing to me.

02:59:27.560 --> 02:59:29.560
Does Irene have a final thought?

02:59:29.560 --> 02:59:31.560
Are you allergic to corn?

02:59:31.560 --> 02:59:33.560
It's fine, I only had a little.

02:59:33.560 --> 02:59:35.560
I want another one.

02:59:35.560 --> 02:59:37.560
Wait a minute! If you're allergic to corn, why eat anymore?

02:59:37.560 --> 02:59:39.560
I won't die.

02:59:39.560 --> 02:59:41.560
Um, let's see...

02:59:41.560 --> 02:59:43.560
Loki, your final thought of the day?

02:59:45.560 --> 02:59:47.560
My furrow hurts from all this yelling and screaming.

02:59:47.560 --> 02:59:49.560
I can't be enthusiastic and stuff.

02:59:49.560 --> 02:59:51.560
Especially with this stupid science thing.

02:59:51.560 --> 02:59:53.560
I'm not being so hateful.

02:59:54.560 --> 02:59:56.560
Why? I hate the world!

02:59:56.560 --> 02:59:57.560
Let go of your hate.

02:59:57.560 --> 03:00:02.560
You know, if people would stop being stupid and start dying, the world would be a better place.

03:00:02.560 --> 03:00:05.560
I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.

03:00:06.560 --> 03:00:10.560
You know, that's one of the reasons I don't get drunk is because I'm not afraid I'm going to get violent.

03:00:10.560 --> 03:00:16.560
I mean, what if the actual inhibitions I have is from killing people and then that goes away?

03:00:16.560 --> 03:00:20.560
Then I would wake up out of a drunken stupor and see a bunch of bodies and blood everywhere.

03:00:20.560 --> 03:00:21.560
Wouldn't that be frightening?

03:00:21.560 --> 03:00:23.560
I just hug people.

03:00:23.560 --> 03:00:25.560
I turn into the absolute opposite when I'm drunk.

03:00:25.560 --> 03:00:29.560
Instead of being all angsty and violent and everything, I can start loving everybody and

03:00:29.560 --> 03:00:31.560
wanting to hug everybody I see.

03:00:31.560 --> 03:00:32.560
Have you noticed that?

03:00:32.560 --> 03:00:38.660
And DDR-Llama, or if anyone has contacts with DDR-Llama right now, please set up my uploading

03:00:38.660 --> 03:00:42.560
script because I'm waiting on you to finish it and you said you'd do it like three days

03:00:42.560 --> 03:00:47.560
ago and you haven't and it's really frustrating because I need to upload my site and get it

03:00:47.560 --> 03:00:48.560
done!

03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:49.560
Were you whining?

03:00:49.560 --> 03:00:50.560
NO!

03:00:50.560 --> 03:00:51.560
Anyways, I'm dead.

03:00:51.560 --> 03:00:52.560
Go!

03:00:52.560 --> 03:01:00.040
I get to be last.

03:01:00.040 --> 03:01:06.860
My final thought of the day is, um, uh, yeah, we're running long and I'm not helping because

03:01:06.860 --> 03:01:14.860
I can't think of a final thought, um, oh, my final thought, um, as the old cheerleaders,

03:01:14.860 --> 03:01:21.860
the old cheerleaders from Saturday Night Live said, sex can wait, masturbate.

03:01:21.860 --> 03:01:27.060
My final thought of the day is I'm going to have Boba and you have to stay tuned for the

03:01:27.060 --> 03:01:32.060
after birth. Alright, bye guys. Bye.

03:01:32.060 --> 03:01:41.060

03:02:30.560 --> 03:02:33.560
Splinter taught them to be ninja teens!

03:02:33.560 --> 03:02:35.560
He's a radical rat!

03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:38.560
Leonardo leads Donatello's dust machine!

03:02:38.560 --> 03:02:40.560
That's a rat, Jack!

03:02:40.560 --> 03:02:42.560
Raphael is cool, but rude!

03:02:42.560 --> 03:02:43.560
Give me a break!

03:02:43.560 --> 03:02:45.560
Michelangelo is a party dude!

03:02:45.560 --> 03:02:46.560
Pardon!

03:02:46.560 --> 03:02:48.560
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!

03:02:48.560 --> 03:02:50.560
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!

03:02:50.560 --> 03:03:02.720
