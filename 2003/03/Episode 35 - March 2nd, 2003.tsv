6119	10021	Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
11622	16666	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
20300	23221	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
23541	26723	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
27303	30004	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
30544	33445	Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
34245	34646	Just kidding.
34846	36446	Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
36646	44109	In this episode... Hey, any balls down there?
44349	46850	That's the biggest bear you've ever seen, Jingleberry.
46930	48651	What's your favorite scary movie?
50077	50678	Showgirls.
51558	52719	Absolutely frightful.
52980	53540	What's yours?
53800	56262	There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
56322	58184	Don't torture yourself.
58224	59245	That's my job.
59265	60946	Now's the time our sprockets bend me dogs!
61006	64129	I'll get you, my pretty.
64309	65751	And your little dog, too.
66051	66972	I know Kung Fu.
67332	69694	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
69974	71836	Why did they have to take the word gay?
73437	76099	Nobody expects a Spanish exposition.
76340	77180	It's Kendo.
77260	77661	Hey!
80031	81833	DarkSakura, Shut up!
82034	82714	Where's my gun?
82834	84797	This is my boomstick!
85257	87781	Sky, Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!
88081	92106	Loki, I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.
92146	94649	What kind of warping being would find that funny?
94909	96191	Orange Lounge Radio,
99961	104247	We are live, and this is episode number 35 for March the 2nd of 2003.
104307	112497	If you're tuned into the Lamonti Scene's most crowded radio station of all things bee money, my name is...
114181	115262	My name is Rob Roberts.
115302	116622	You might know me as Sky.
117783	118844	I'm a poet and I don't know it.
119304	120825	But your feet are short because they're long-fellows.
121805	122666	My feet are big.
123366	124087	You know what that means.
124147	125247	Attention guys out there.
125467	126528	Rob wears big shoes.
126808	135673	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest and most loud-mouthed bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.
135693	139655	You know her better as DarkSakura.
140216	142297	In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.
146714	149276	Also with us tonight, we have a whole ass load of guests.
149336	151699	Say hello to Shark Skrulls in the house.
152560	154662	Everyone else is in the other room playing Animal Crossing.
154682	155603	I'm thinking about joining them.
155984	156704	Hey, traitor.
157485	158807	Hey, I gotta get bones back.
160108	165314	And also with us, say hello to Mel B. I believe that children are our future.
171323	172323	Say hello to Dave.
173084	173544	Hello.
173564	174684	I haven't been here in a while.
175285	176805	And there's a whole bunch of other people.
176825	177505	Oh, wait, Brad.
177685	178606	Oh, say hello to Brad.
181887	182847	Why are you balking?
184068	184568	Ah, shit.
186209	188390	Oops, I had a little technical difficulty there.
188430	188870	Sorry about that.
189710	190010	Hi.
190330	190690	Say hello.
190771	191191	Oh, hi, Brad.
191251	192911	And then in the back is the Ice Queen.
194452	195292	Say hello to the Ice Queen.
195312	195652	Come on in.
199036	201617	Wow, that's twice this month I've been called a douchebag.
204658	207019	Tell me, Rob, do you feel not so fresh?
207039	209019	Oh yeah, that's right, we're in a new month now.
209299	211620	So that means next month somebody else has to call Rob a douchebag.
212801	214141	Who wants to take the turn this time?
215461	216222	Okay, you can do it.
216402	217442	Don't forget, April 1st.
217542	219903	No, you have to do it April 2nd because it's a joke.
219963	222084	I'm getting reports that all of our listeners might...
272003	272603	Thanks for watching!
338695	339656	Thanks for watching!
390222	395025	From StepSquad to OrangeLabs, this PDR sucks!
395105	400908	Holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla!
404145	406587	Apparently Dave knows what camel piss tastes like.
408588	409848	Tastes just like it smells.
410109	410889	Alright, we're back.
412150	423537	Unfortunately what happened just before the break, for some reason, we didn't show ourselves as going down off the air, but all our listeners got dropped, so they're slowly coming back on the stream, and it's kind of ironic that they should come back to the beauty of silence.
424837	425158	Get it?
427819	428740	Ow, ow, I hurt.
429895	430956	You'll hurt after I kick you.
432397	434638	Okay, so, what's up?
434678	436519	Big round table, just stuff.
436539	437099	What table?
437380	437640	There's four.
437660	439001	We had round table pizza for lunch.
439201	440141	Indian chair?
440381	441622	Ooh, somebody else.
442523	443443	We had Eastern Buffet.
443543	445104	If it is Ryan, tell him where his letter is.
445124	447105	We ate somewhere much better than round table.
447366	448987	Okay, where'd you guys go for lunch today?
450007	450988	Where did we go for lunch?
451048	452168	Oh, we went to Eastern Buffet.
452209	454350	We had Chinese food and it was yummy.
456002	457943	So today's a little bit of a buzz show.
458924	463027	I'm downing a Smirnoff Black with Mel.
463547	466789	A toast to a non-crappy show for once.
466949	471312	No, I'm just kidding.
471933	472473	Who's all here?
472533	472893	Dang.
473154	475315	It sounded like five people just got here.
476896	477336	Who got here?
481879	482620	Oh my god.
483280	484021	Well, how's today?
484707	486788	Today it is kind of a full house.
487169	487489	Okay.
488410	488790	So.
491011	493553	Everywhere we go, everywhere you look.
493573	497075	Okay, after what we were watching today that showed what's your face from full house.
497336	498396	Candace Cameron.
498416	499257	Yeah, Candace Cameron.
502164	503966	What the hell ever happened to Candace Cameron?
504266	504927	She's very pretty.
505087	505608	I want to know.
505748	507170	I'm going on the website to look.
507210	514938	Candace Cameron met a hockey player by the name of Valerie Brewery and got engaged in Paris and got married and has two kids.
514998	515439	Go fig.
515479	518102	And she looked like a slut for a long time because she had platinum blonde hair.
518755	519536	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
544560	546301	Oh, hello to our other guests who just got here.
546321	546741	What's up?
547461	548522	Say hello and introduce yourselves.
548542	549842	I don't have much room on the mics here.
552083	552543	Hey, what's up?
552603	553204	Everyone knows me.
553384	553824	I'm Zero.
553984	554464	How's it going?
554864	555524	The intern.
556305	556685	What's up?
557125	559026	This is Johnny, a.k.a.
559086	559546	Bombay.
562307	565588	Okay, and now I'm going to finish talking about Candace Cameron.
567029	568850	Oh, Billy the Big Fat Queer is here!
570250	570991	Say hello, Billy!
572151	572511	Hi.
573412	574012	How are you, Billy?
574653	575193	Peachy Keen
592771	594512	I gave some guys... Wait, no, no, no, no.
595413	595773	Hold on.
595933	597474	First Candice, then your story.
598235	599876	Oh, hi, you're listening to Orange Lounge, Bomani Radio.
599896	602017	Sometimes we talk about the game with the arrows.
602297	602998	I hear it's popular.
603038	605039	Anyway... And we talk about porn a lot.
616449	632921	Since her years as DJ Tanner on the long-running sitcom Full House, she has had the lead role in six movies, guest starred on four television shows, and executive produced an entertaining child safety show.
633061	633501	Really?
636633	644963	She is married to ice hockey player Valery Bire, who sucks ass, and has three children.
646064	647746	I don't want to know what their association is.
648246	651169	They're named Suck, Ass, and Who.
656907	657808	Come here, suck.
658068	658828	Come here, ass.
658929	659149	Okay.
659729	669175	Since I was 10 years old, Candice has been a distraught role model for me through her varied acting roles and admirable participation in organizations like the Starlight Foundation.
669496	670316	Which sucks ass.
670536	671917	Hey, that's a charity.
672598	673558	It's an ass-sucking charity.
673959	676120	Her openness and love... Oh, wait, wait, wait.
676200	676781	Here's the best part.
677181	680283	Her openness and love for Christianity is refreshing.
683058	684201	and the Church of Ass-Sucking.
685744	687588	So she sucks little boys' asses then.
690832	692133	Oh, okay.
692214	693174	Hello.
693475	695356	Refreshing is this nice malt beverage right here.
695436	698679	And then it talks about growing up with Candice.
698720	703864	So if you want to visit All About Candice Cameron, go to www.candicecameronbure.net.
705286	706266	If you want to suck some ass.
708629	709249	Okay.
710450	712773	Speaking of sucking ass, let's get to story time with Billy.
714534	716375	Storytime with Billy!
740385	741785	This better be the Jerry Halliwell version.
741825	742666	It is the Jerry Halliwell.
742866	744246	It's the DDR Jerry Halliwell version.
744786	745666	Tell your tale, Billy.
746107	749988	Well, it was Mardi Gras night, and we had quite a bit of fun, and I got a couple beats here and there.
750388	751648	Wait, and how did you get beats?
753148	753769	How do you think?
756049	757570	Did you show your titties to some lesbians?
757770	760510	I did show my titties to some lesbians.
760570	762431	And then some cute boys just walked in and gave me beats.
762471	763611	I didn't have to show them anything.
763771	764171	Wow.
765012	770153	So anyways, on the way out, there was a cute drunk boy, and he saw, I didn't give him any beats, so I'm like, what are you going to give me?
773704	775105	Billy just cut right to the chase.
775425	777125	What are you going to give me?
777145	779306	I'll let you stick your hand down my pants.
779366	781727	And I'm like, well, okay.
784468	785389	Not that I'm complaining.
785469	786949	I've got quite a handful.
789150	793912	And then Matt got a C. And I got a hold of it and see it.
793952	796533	So it was a wonderful, fun night.
796633	797173	Oh, Matt's here.
797413	798014	Matt, come here, come here.
798054	799594	Do you have anything you want to add to this story, Matt?
800294	801275	Or I'm sorry, the Ice Queen?
805071	806632	What he got to grab, I got to see.
807273	810775	He wanted some more beats, he came up to me and said, well, what do I got to do to get some beats?
810855	812376	I said, well, you know, you got to show me your stuff.
813036	814657	And so he whipped it right out, and there it was.
815738	817699	And we got to see what he got to grab.
821744	824885	You know, he asked for beads for me too, so I'm like, what do I get?
824905	826205	And he said, I get the same thing.
826565	834887	So I gave him some beads, and like, you know, he opened up his pants, and you know, I started to put my hand on there, and I'm like, no, no, honey, I've got more class than Billy does.
835367	836427	Prude.
836487	837668	You're a prude.
837988	839728	I was trying to start fights in the parking lot.
843249	845569	Yeah, sometimes we talk about some arrow game, I don't know.
845589	847110	Monkey 6.
849241	853602	I filled your gay sex quota, now it's time for... Yeah, the show is getting too gay.
853742	859084	Pussy, cunt, clit, cock... Thank you.
860004	863305	Alright, quick, the chatroom is getting restless because we haven't talked about anything but Monty yet.
863385	865405	So, Loki, give us a topic.
865605	866246	Monty sucks ass.
866266	867746	Give us a topic we can have a roundtable about.
867926	868766	Oh god, okay.
869226	879009	Starting off this week, well obviously everyone knows that DDR Max 2, the Japanese version, is coming out April 25th, I believe.
880768	882569	Yes, April 25th.
883290	891014	Also announced with it is going to be a brand new V-Rare CD, V-Rare number 5, which I don't get because once they mass produce the CD, it's not really rare anymore.
892170	892450	Shut up.
892710	904598	Anyways, well, some of the things that are going to be on it, obviously, is going to be the ability to make link data for DDR Extreme, which will be nice, because you'll be able to actually record data for all the songs instead of like half.
905699	910442	And also, it's rumored to be that there's over 70 songs, including some from DDR Extreme.
912304	926151	Which means you're going to see Dynamite Rave, Downbird Soda Mix, Look to the Sky, True Colors Mix, Do It Right, the Harmonized Two-Set Mix, Drop the Bomb System FX Mix, and AM3P 303 Bass Mix.
926231	928973	And that's it from DDR Extreme.
929013	932855	If they have La Copa de la Vida, I'll be so happy, because that's the best song ever.
935282	937784	No, you don't understand.
938245	943189	I said it was like a foreign language until someone said Ricky Martin song.
944350	946673	So, yeah, that's what's coming out April 25th.
947093	948134	Okay, discuss.
950196	957102	Well, I for one am super excited about this, except I'm fucking broke and I have to move next month.
957462	960025	But, you know, I'll probably scrape some money out of the couch and buy it anyway.
960652	961573	It's okay, you can play mine.
961813	962734	It'll be my birthday month.
962814	964135	Oh, gee, I can come over and play.
964155	964716	That would be great.
966437	968419	Like hell, we're gonna buy one, dammit!
968439	974544	I was brought to you by... We're gonna buy one so I can rip the songs and put them on the internet and stuff.
975145	981390	Well, the thing is, I don't know if Konami happens to, like, be spying on me, but every time a game comes out, my birthday's around there.
982971	983592	It's just for you, man.
984393	985033	It's just for me.
985113	986915	Is that an effect that you just released games in April and November?
986935	988336	I actually blew the big money world.
990129	991790	They have the tie into my life.
992170	993831	And no to release games around my birthday.
993971	997253	DDR Max 2, USA, November.
997813	998214	Of course.
1000035	1001235	Any idea what's going to be on that?
1001275	1002636	Are they going to give us anything special?
1003076	1008820	Probably just like, you know, same thing as last time, maybe some more new exclusive songs and whatnot.
1010541	1012702	So, yeah, nothing yet.
1013202	1015243	Of course, we'll know more after E3.
1016143	1016544	That's true.
1017264	1018284	If we can get into it.
1018524	1019645	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
1021085	1022146	Mel's got his hand raised.
1022166	1022486	Hold on.
1023126	1024767	That's because DDR Spot got the hookup.
1025007	1025547	Like, whoa.
1026068	1027528	Why can't Orange Lounge get the hookup?
1027568	1027968	Like, what?
1029909	1033070	People who are engaged to GameStop employees get the hookup.
1034291	1035071	Well, um...
1040563	1047029	Yes, Jason Ninos actually hires a lot of DDR Spot, Beemaniacs, and other people to dance for him at the Boots.
1047089	1048350	That's pretty much how we get our hookup.
1049131	1050712	You know, I'm extremely fashionable.
1050792	1052354	Maybe that could, you know, go for something.
1053134	1057338	You'd be surprised how everybody at E3 looks good for some reason or another.
1058059	1059200	You could muddle a dance pad.
1060430	1061492	I could be a dance pad.
1061992	1063895	Hey, I won a dance pad at E3.
1064216	1067240	I kicked everyone's ass at Britney's, like, dance beat.
1068102	1069384	Yeah!
1069464	1070645	Okay, there's my claim to fame.
1070665	1070986	You're Billy's...
1073993	1075174	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1093673	1100396	You know, every brand name out there has a billboard the size of like a freaking street, you know, the street billboards.
1100916	1105958	Everybody looks good, not just the people who model off games, but like even the business exec women and guys.
1105998	1108079	I don't know, you know, it's like everyone's just all glass.
1108099	1110700	There's celebrities that roll through there, like my boy Henry.
1110740	1113501	He saw Robin Williams in there and got, you know, a picture with him.
1113881	1117682	I almost was able to flag down Gary Coleman for an autograph, but he was in a rush.
1118062	1118803	What you talking about, Mel?
1121581	1131285	Our friend Ryan goes there every year and brings back a videotape, but this last year he went and saw Bruce Campbell again and got Bruce Campbell to record his answering machine message.
1132046	1134587	Wow, that's a serious hookup.
1134707	1144551	And yeah, other celebrities like at the THQ, I think it was, they had Stacey Kubler freaking like... Bruce Campbell on the goddamn radio show.
1144971	1147512	Come on, Bruce Campbell on the goddamn radio show!
1148536	1153180	Hey, just tell me who I have to blow to get in the door and we're there, okay?
1156222	1157424	Sorry, I didn't want to cut off your story.
1157864	1159585	But yeah, pretty much E3 is just a blast.
1159645	1163308	And not only do you just see what's new, it's all about the free stuff, man.
1163348	1166851	It's all about just nabbing posters, friggin' demo discs.
1166871	1169213	Is it your fourth?
1169233	1169814	Is it your fourth year?
1170602	1175145	I have to cut in really fast because Billy the Big Homo has to go but I wanted to ask him if he has any final thoughts.
1195083	1195263	No.
1196164	1196764	Not even one?
1197184	1197825	Not even one.
1198365	1199165	Song lyric, maybe?
1199526	1200566	Final thoughts, is this like Jerry Springer?
1200586	1201587	I just can't get you out of my head.
1203928	1204829	It's all I think about.
1205109	1205689	Alright, get out of here.
1205789	1205989	Later.
1206590	1207390	Bye, Billy, thank you.
1207410	1209551	Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, oh hell yeah, later.
1210512	1211352	Oh, you guys are going too?
1211773	1212293	That sucks.
1212913	1213654	Wait, where's Anita?
1213914	1214534	Bring Anita in here.
1216876	1218196	It's suddenly become the goodbye show.
1218236	1221959	I know, this is like, it's the, oh my god, who walks into the studio next show?
1222259	1224140	It's DDRholic, ladies and gentlemen, say hello.
1224966	1225487	Hi, everybody.
1225527	1225987	How are you?
1226568	1227689	What are you doing in town today?
1228750	1229631	Actually, I'm moving in.
1230632	1230892	Here?
1230972	1231633	You're moving in here?
1231653	1235637	No, I'm moving in with Ryan and Johnny.
1237338	1238159	Well, hello.
1238860	1243965	And I know you're kind of in and out, but do you have any final thoughts for the radio show or anything you want to say?
1244005	1244586	Any shout-outs?
1245592	1246052	Let's see.
1246072	1247012	I don't know.
1247953	1249493	I don't know too many people anymore.
1250113	1254975	Shoutouts to all the DDR people out there who love DDR and all the money.
1256035	1256395	All right.
1256655	1257115	Well put.
1257155	1257576	Thank you.
1258036	1258276	All right.
1258296	1258536	Take care.
1258836	1259196	Be safe.
1259376	1259916	Have a good move.
1260316	1260656	All right.
1265838	1266138	All right.
1267519	1271920	We should be able to get E3 tickets because we have word in the industry, right?
1272941	1293319	Well, probably the best thing to do is just talk to Jason Enos, you know, because he gets, you know, for all his pull, he gets a lot of guest passes, so if nothing else, you may not get, like, the perks of media, which means you get to have, like, exclusive use of, like, say, you get media guides and, like, kits and all that stuff, but you still get to go around and go everywhere else, you just don't get to go inside, like, behind the wall and get free food, but... Oh, well, bummer.
1295140	1296742	You know what, you'll take what you get and you'll like it.
1300214	1302515	My god, I feel like there's a party going on in the hallway.
1302615	1308177	If you've received tickets to your home address once, you will always receive tickets.
1308637	1311498	Even if you are no longer in the industry, you will always receive tickets.
1313139	1318581	I know, I got my thing in the mail about two months ago saying, yeah, re-register for E3.
1318661	1319961	I'm like, hell yeah.
1323062	1324223	Okay, bye.
1324663	1325343	Now who's leaving?
1328074	1329075	What is E3?
1329635	1334480	I'm wondering if I could use one of my old paychecks from Cyber Station.
1334841	1336302	Hi, I used to work for Namco.
1336422	1338244	Look, my paycheck says Namco.
1338444	1346051	Dave just asked you a question of the hour, which is actually kind of funny because a lot of people may actually not know this, and here we are sitting talking around about E3.
1346091	1347613	What exactly is E3 for those who don't know?
1348804	1350104	Electronic Entertainment Expo.
1351065	1352285	Yeah, that goes on in LA.
1352325	1359067	Basically, it's the big Albie of all video games, computer entertainment and such.
1359747	1361107	It's Vegas in a nutshell.
1361227	1363048	It's every geek's dream to go up in there.
1363428	1364588	And fan service for the guys.
1365348	1367949	And some lesbians.
1368689	1372250	It's when all the big game companies get together to show off their new toys.
1373871	1375471	They had Xena there a couple years ago, didn't they?
1375491	1375571	Yeah.
1376272	1378253	Oh, everybody's up in there.
1385257	1389740	Just walk up to him, behind him, you know, my neck, my back, my pussy, and my crack.
1394243	1395083	I just want to go.
1395183	1396544	I want to go.
1397044	1398545	I want to go to this.
1399045	1401447	Because I don't like my work and I'd rather go instead.
1403953	1406975	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1428949	1434115	Some of the people who've been, like, just working their way up, finally get to the top or get some recognition.
1434836	1436077	It was cool for them, definitely.
1436157	1440542	I was happy to see, I guess, what a lot of people are referring to as the torch being passed.
1440562	1445508	You know, it's like the old schools kind of, like, making way for the newer, the new jacks, the new generation.
1446068	1451433	and I'm totally fine because most people out there like Bruce Lee or AJ and such, they've busted themselves pretty hard.
1451593	1453575	It's good to see them get some recognition for a change.
1453735	1454936	I mean, I wanted some.
1454976	1457819	I want a slice of the pie, but it was cool.
1457839	1460641	I'm glad people still like to see me out there and whatever.
1461622	1462123	Cool, cool deal.
1462714	1466976	I have to ask you guys, Shark Scroll, I know you are huge on the Derby Owners Club.
1467736	1469356	I'm trying to break myself of it.
1469396	1472077	I haven't played it since the last time you were in the Bay.
1472257	1475198	Oh no, I was going to ask if you went to that tournament that they had at Milpitas.
1475598	1480040	I kind of didn't even realize it was happening because I thought it was the following week.
1480240	1481481	What have you been up to lately then, girl?
1482781	1483121	Work.
1483861	1487683	I see Mel B and then I go to sleep and that's about damn near it.
1488003	1489503	Well, you know, gotta do what you gotta do.
1489543	1491484	Work sucks for the record, but that's okay.
1492791	1495073	On a side note, Oki actually won the Derby Owners Club.
1495093	1496413	How the hell did that happen?
1496654	1498195	I coached him in the final match.
1499796	1502718	See, Ross actually was kicking a lot of ass.
1502758	1507941	He had the most wins and had the most money, but the last match was a G1, which is like the big high stakes.
1508441	1514445	And then Oki was just asking me for advice, and I'm like, do this right here, hold the horse right there, whip it right there, bam, wasn't even close.
1514946	1516407	Wow, that's pretty cool.
1517367	1519889	Doesn't Derby Owners Club kind of handicap you if you're behind or something, though?
1520504	1521585	Only in one certain race.
1522965	1525767	But everything else is skill of the player.
1526107	1527588	I wonder how well Politary would have done.
1529309	1532611	Yeah, because the last time I raced, I remember Politary won like her second race.
1532651	1533571	And I was actually racing.
1533611	1535152	I think I was racing Ross in that one.
1535172	1535432	I don't know.
1535452	1537233	I was racing some of the better players.
1537293	1537813	And I won.
1537833	1538994	And I was like, how the hell did I win that?
1539014	1539574	My horse sucks.
1539614	1541615	And somebody was telling me, oh, well, they handicap it.
1541756	1543516	And I still have the picture.
1543797	1546418	I still have the picture that says Politary is very happy.
1548519	1549780	Politary the horse rules.
1551792	1553279	I'm sorry, hot man sex still rules.
1555449	1555730	Okay.
1556977	1566099	So, alright, how about we take a quick break, and then we come back, and we're going to do the FUs of the week, before the people have to go, because I know we certainly have a lot of angst.
1566119	1569219	Yeah, we're going to have another three hour long FU segment.
1569259	1570520	No, this is what we'll do.
1570960	1574720	Everybody in the studio can FU as much as they want, but everybody in the chatroom will limit to like three FUs.
1575280	1581542	Okay, so chatroom, send your FUs on to me over private message, but three at the most, because we don't want this to go on forever.
1582582	1583142	Alright, so...
1596069	1598350	Okay, so yeah, we're going to... Did somebody turn the mic off?
1598790	1600111	Uh-oh.
1600751	1602292	That was the other line.
1602332	1602632	Beep.
1603512	1605093	Yeah, sorry, we had to take a call on the other line.
1606973	1611215	We're going to go to... I used to do that when we had a phone that had a pause that would mute the line.
1612035	1616477	I would tap it, and people thought I had a call waiting, so if I got tired of talking to them, I'd do it.
1616857	1618098	I'm sorry, that was for my grandmother.
1618118	1618878	I have to let you go.
1623522	1630248	It's cool when you have the mute button and you just push it and see how long it takes people to actually think you hung up on us.
1631128	1631769	You're mean.
1632990	1640416	Alright, if you missed it, FUs of the Week are coming up next, but you're limited to three in the chat room just because we're trying to make it under an hour long this week.
1640496	1644700	So, we'll be right back after this quick break.
1715555	1716640	Thanks for watching!
1869282	1871350	and more, you can't stop my shittin', what you gettin'?
1871390	1871953	Hell yeah, man!
1901704	1902925	You got to bring your mind
1946855	1948616	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
1948836	1951318	Because Bongo demands it.
1952699	1955121	Hi, we're back.
1955181	1957483	Yeah, they were talking in the chat room about 1998.
1957543	1959984	Sounds like every other Naoki song that's been made, they're saying.
1960024	1961125	Sounds like D2R and everything else.
1961225	1963026	I just like that one because I like the background.
1963867	1966069	And it's really easy to PA, I think.
1966109	1966669	That's why I like it.
1966689	1967730	You know what I want to say?
1967870	1968010	What?
1968030	1970352	I want to say is, where's 2MB?
1970732	1972393	We need some more 2MB remixes.
1972433	1973654	There's Trip Machine Survivor?
1974468	1975229	That's on 2MB.
1975349	1975629	Isn't it?
1975730	1976290	I don't know.
1976611	1977852	That's just Desire.
1978553	1979714	We need 2MB.
1979855	1983219	You know what the next song that's going to get the 2MB treatment is going to be fucking Bag.
1983639	1984861	Because Bag sucks ass.
1985561	1987664	You need to make a trans version of Bag.
1988665	1989646	The Legend of Bag.
1990367	1991348	Or the Legend of Haggis.
1991489	1993231	They already have the Legend of Bag sucks.
1993391	1993912	Do they really?
1994392	1995573	Yeah.
1995734	1998957	Okay, the worst fucking remix I heard this week, okay?
1999378	2003403	The Legend of Max 300, or Max Unlimited 300, or something like that.
2003843	2005425	It is not even a remix.
2005505	2012193	It's like, okay, let's just stop it, start playing Max 300, stop it again, start... It didn't even sound... It's not a remix.
2012273	2012934	It's just awful.
2012954	2013915	And people are like, oh, cool!
2016400	2017422	No, I haven't heard Climax.
2017843	2018845	Also, read in the chat room.
2018865	2020789	And if you're not in our chat room, you should join it.
2020829	2025498	Just go to our website, orangelounge.skie.cx and click on chat.
2026966	2028247	I swear she's like a cancer.
2050237	2053359	I have to say, to her credit, lately she's been able to hold a key.
2053739	2057021	But I think that's just because someone's been beating her over the head more and more.
2057442	2063145	You know, it's like, for anyone who's ever been in band, you can buy an instrument and it can be built out of tune.
2063486	2065507	Well, I think that Politary has been built out of tune.
2065827	2068569	So they did what they do with some instruments and beat them into shape.
2069284	2071305	I know Brad would be so mad at you right now.
2085157	2087099	What was that machine in Josie and the Pussycats?
2087199	2090982	The one, the big machine they had that would make them all in tune?
2091562	2092903	Not the Mr. Movie Phone, there was something else.
2092923	2095185	Then they had the subliminal messages from Mr. Movie Phone, you know?
2096286	2097827	Purple is the new orange.
2099028	2102231	You know, he's talking about that machine that, you know, you can sing out of key and sing in key.
2102251	2104092	That's probably how you got 100 points for that.
2104112	2105994	Hey, hey, hey, I don't like where you're going with that, mister.
2106254	2107115	I don't like where you're going with that.
2108695	2110676	I actually, you know what, maybe I can find it later.
2110716	2114478	No, I couldn't play it during the actual show, but I do have Irene and I. I taped Irene and I singing Boys.
2115138	2115838	I remember.
2116239	2117159	We got 100 on it, too.
2117259	2136968	One day at Rob's little apartment in Roseville, when I had laryngitis, Rob standing tall while everyone was sitting, with his hand to his side, diva-style singing that I'm like a bird song, with his eyes skyward, and I'm sitting here going, God damn, I'm glad I have laryngitis.
2140265	2146952	I have a very vivid memory of just this, like Rob's on stage with a spotlight on him and he's got a feather bullet.
2147893	2149214	Now that's going to be DDR Idol.
2150796	2155220	No, actually I am not participating in DDR Idol, but I have a brother who is.
2156561	2158363	Mr. Spanky.
2159444	2161106	I want to be a judge.
2161997	2164918	No, we already have the judges for DDR Idol, I guess, what's going on.
2165879	2167059	Alright, let's talk March Madness.
2167079	2169820	I need to go ahead and say one thing.
2170300	2174042	The only thing that any of us from Sackboy Money are doing is admin work.
2174982	2178184	And running the 2DX portion of the tournament.
2178204	2179504	2DX tourney is going to rock, by the way.
2179544	2180605	It's going to be pretty intricate.
2180965	2184346	Rules will be posted within the next few days, possibly as soon as tomorrow.
2185246	2186247	And it's going to be cool.
2186267	2187147	I think you guys will like it.
2187187	2188848	A lot of people are coming from out of town to do it.
2189289	2195453	As far as Perfect Attack goes, there's rules posted on DDRSpot.com, DDRFreak, in the tournament forum.
2196915	2199576	They're going to be on Sack of Imani as soon as we get the site up.
2202579	2204320	As we all look at Loki.
2205661	2208583	I'll throw something together then.
2208663	2212045	You have any answering questions and then beating people with bats?
2213146	2215388	Actually, you know, I'm thinking about auctioning off my bat.
2216480	2220062	Yeah, what's this about you're going to put your bat on the new DDR Freak Marketplace or something?
2220703	2226366	No, I'm just going to go around and hit people in the head with it and go, Hi, you've been deemed by, you know, some of the most famous people in the big money world.
2227447	2229008	At least they've been seen.
2229028	2232050	You've already, you actually hit yourself with a bat.
2232790	2235972	Uh, question for Loki from the chat room, and I already think I know the answer.
2236072	2240895	But, apparently the rumor is you can triple A Fuhurata's theme.
2241276	2241736	Is that true?
2243057	2243297	What?
2243317	2243517	What?
2244312	2247554	Somebody in the chat room is asking if you can triple-A Fuhurata Steam, Ninzaburro.
2248194	2248494	No?
2249995	2251555	I can't triple-A shit, man.
2251615	2253316	I totally suck at PA.
2253396	2255517	Somebody claims they played DDR with you and you triple-A'd it.
2257038	2257638	Okay!
2258659	2260340	I wish I was there because I only played doubles.
2261920	2264001	So how much drugs were these people doing?
2264021	2265082	I don't know.
2265822	2269864	I only played doubles, and if I triple-A'd that, I mean, that would be pretty sweet, but no.
2270124	2271745	I might have triple-A'd it on basic.
2274259	2278400	I've double A'd Rhythm and Police on my new pads that suck.
2279500	2279880	You know what?
2279940	2281140	You know what fucking sucks?
2281600	2283861	Again, one great on all these EX songs.
2284481	2285821	I can't get my fucking triple A on Heavy.
2285841	2287161	I always get one fucking great.
2288322	2289942	Oh, that brings me around to the FUs.
2290782	2292162	I can't even get one great.
2292462	2294843	Five is my best, I think.
2295583	2296803	Back to Marsh Madness.
2296983	2297523	Oh, hi, yes.
2297563	2298784	Fourth mix?
2303160	2306065	I don't know, the guy's in Iowa, so that's a really good question.
2306085	2308348	Where was I in Iowa?
2309590	2311212	This is actually turning into a pretty good story.
2316008	2317469	On the dream plane, no.
2318009	2319589	But no, back to March Madness.
2319869	2320230	Hello.
2321390	2324051	The dates for the tournament are March 29th, March 30th.
2324111	2326072	It will be at Scandia in Sacramento.
2327052	2328513	There's addresses, there's directions.
2328653	2331474	Everything's going to be posted in one form or another.
2333354	2336315	But we're going to be giving updates throughout.
2336716	2339737	Like we were saying, we should have rules for the 2DX tournament posted this week.
2340557	2343378	And it's going to be fun, right?
2343979	2344119	Yeah.
2344139	2344980	It's going to be fun.
2345420	2345660	Fun.
2345680	2346481	It'll be exciting.
2346801	2347682	It'll definitely be exciting.
2348382	2350784	It will make people's heart race.
2351304	2352705	It'll bring a couple of thrills.
2353246	2353566	Oh, yes.
2354707	2358049	And I still want my home run derby tournament for March Madness.
2358689	2360130	We are actually working on that.
2360330	2368316	I actually did leave the suggestion for doing the... We didn't get to talk about it in depth, but I did leave the suggestion for... This is the bummer.
2368336	2370137	Like, you know, bang a ball for dollars.
2370397	2370778	Yeah.
2372077	2378409	I had suggested that we possibly at Scandia have bumper boats at Scandia, that we have a wet t-shirt contest in the bumper boats.
2378830	2380674	However, unfortunately, they can't do that.
2380834	2382136	It's a family environment.
2382397	2382718	Because...
2385422	2386843	I work there, okay?
2386903	2389425	You got the inside on the bumper boats, alright?
2389585	2392487	I can make that happen, trust me.
2392868	2399352	My co-workers would probably, in fact, you know, enter a couple people they know in the contest.
2399392	2400753	I'm totally serious, too.
2401574	2402194	This is the problem.
2402234	2410941	From what I told, a big radio station here in Sacramento, the Rock Station in Sacramento, did a big... As I hear the grunt from the former intern...
2412862	2415884	It's the better one, not the one that plays the Sublime song every six songs.
2415984	2417245	Mommy, mommy, I saw boobies!
2441775	2443476	Dad's going to park his car in your garage.
2444416	2447858	Why would you go run home and tell your mom?
2447918	2449619	It's like, Mom, look, I saw boobies.
2450340	2452221	Don't tell your mom that.
2452681	2462606	Since I used to be the intern there, I'll tell you right now, 95% of the contests they have are all horrible ideas, just like that one, because they don't ever think of what can happen.
2462987	2467549	They just think of what's going to get the most 40-year-old dirty guys out there.
2467629	2468329	That's all it is.
2469170	2471071	Like the people doing it in the church?
2474574	2475415	That was good radio.
2477176	2482621	So what, can we go, like, hire people to go to the Presbyterian church down the road and go, hey, hey.
2483277	2489319	You know, this is going to be interesting, though, because we will be broadcasting, Orange Islands Radio will be broadcasting live all day long, both days.
2489940	2491340	We're going to have a lot of help this time.
2491360	2492521	We're not leaving one person in control.
2492541	2493821	We're not going to be constrained in the corner.
2493881	2494761	No, this is going to be great.
2494941	2495962	That was your trial by fire.
2496002	2502324	If things work out like we're hoping, Orange Islands Radio is going to have its own little freaking temple that day.
2502384	2503205	It's going to be awesome.
2503305	2504605	Can I get a squirt gun to shoot people with?
2505546	2505746	Yes.
2505766	2505926	Yes.
2507386	2508967	I have a squirt gun that looks like an Uzi.
2511368	2511568	March...
2512390	2516672	No, it actually is just a water gun, but it looks exactly like a doozy.
2516692	2521175	It was part of my Jill Valentine costume for Resident Evil AX.
2521875	2527078	The first time I played DDR was dressed as Jill Valentine on a DDR machine.
2527118	2528039	Did you play Silent Hill?
2529560	2529760	No.
2530860	2534422	Actually, my first song that I ever played on third mix was Xanadu.
2534442	2534662	Of course.
2534682	2535423	And then Dynamite Rave.
2541135	2541855	and Army Boots.
2541935	2546477	Never play Dynamite Raven Army Boots, by the way, especially ones that aren't broken in.
2546517	2547877	Ah, 23rd Magus has a zing here.
2548177	2549998	We'll be broadcasting from the Temple of Butt.
2552139	2553939	Come inside the Temple of Butt.
2554399	2556100	We should hang a little sign.
2556560	2559061	It's too bad Scandia is the family fun center.
2559081	2560361	It'll have to be the Temple of Gutius Maximus.
2560381	2561061	Rob, what are we going to do?
2561121	2561802	Barbecued fried clams?
2568382	2568562	Oh!
2569924	2570304	Alright.
2571726	2571907	Okay.
2571927	2572367	Y'all are dirty!
2576232	2578794	I don't know, 100 tacos ain't enough to feed RTF by themselves, man.
2603588	2605089	100 tacos ain't enough to feed Mike Ngo.
2605109	2606290	What are you guys talking about?
2608332	2619742	No, but seriously, March Madness, it kind of, like everybody was expecting there to be a March Madness this year, and everybody was kind of looking out for it, but at the same time, it literally seems to have come out of nowhere, and it's rapidly snowballing, festering, getting huge.
2620022	2621323	It's going to be like this huge event.
2621383	2623005	It's going to be the biggest thing in NorCal Intel B3.
2624406	2626908	So, you guys have to come if you're in the area.
2626948	2631512	I can't say anything officially on this yet, but keep your eyes on all the boards.
2631752	2632533	Keep listening to us.
2633073	2635555	Because there might be a little bit more to this tournament.
2635876	2637537	Are you talking about the Power Station bit?
2637557	2640139	Because that has been officially announced.
2640680	2642541	It's a twist greater than Joe Millionaire!
2642901	2643402	Look out!
2643802	2645984	It's an all-new tournament.
2646024	2646564	That's a twist.
2646725	2650688	This tournament is also going to serve as qualifiers for that other one.
2651149	2657354	It's going to serve as qualifiers for the big Power Station tournament, which is this chain of arcades, I believe, and maybe you know a little more about this, Mel?
2657454	2657835	I don't know.
2658115	2661038	I think there's going to be somewhere around three qualifiers, I believe.
2661098	2666102	Two in SoCal, I think one in Fresno, maybe two in SoCal, one in NorCal, just of course being the first.
2666362	2668424	Yeah, it's going to be an invite-only contest.
2668644	2675490	Yes, I believe top three from each competition will be invited to the big power station for a thousand bucks in prizes or like more.
2675750	2676731	Then we do have a twist.
2676851	2680213	At March Madness, ladies and gentlemen, top six will be qualifying.
2680313	2685918	So if you want a good chance of qualifying... I think I'd better get on the bus then.
2686018	2687479	Is this for PA or something?
2688200	2688760	Freestyle.
2688920	2689381	Freestyle.
2689721	2690101	And PA.
2690402	2691582	Oh, you've got to enter PA, Dave.
2691602	2693204	You might qualify for the power station.
2693244	2695606	You can walk away with fabulous cash and prizes.
2696466	2696967	Oh boy!
2699325	2700786	I don't know if a fourth mix is giving away.
2700826	2703106	If you don't enter the 2DX tournament, I'm going to kick you.
2705307	2706647	But I'm not good at 2DX.
2707568	2709368	Brad and DJ Syndrome are good.
2709968	2710928	DJ Syndrome can't enter.
2710948	2712129	DJ Syndrome is helping us run it.
2713989	2715130	So are you going to enter?
2716450	2716870	Fine.
2719171	2719451	Alright.
2721468	2722929	They were asking me if I was going to enter.
2723749	2724970	I got a chuckle out of that one.
2725070	2728432	Well, there might be incentive for even the bad people to be entering.
2728572	2730553	The people who don't consider themselves good at 2DX.
2730573	2732094	There's even incentive for you guys to enter.
2732114	2732814	I can't even play 2DX.
2732874	2733935	It's just a surprise.
2734935	2739617	I look like a fucking retard going, NERD BUTTONS!
2740758	2741338	You know what's funny?
2741358	2743680	It's the way the 2DX machine is at Scandia right now.
2743700	2745300	You know how the buttons light up and they flash?
2745721	2747962	On the one-player side, the two-key...
2748826	2750407	and the six key are burned out.
2750487	2752247	So you have the four on the bottom and then the middle one.
2752267	2753347	It looks like a giant middle finger.
2753367	2757189	Because you have these four ones on the bottom and then one that's kind of raised up above the others.
2757269	2758109	So it's kind of cool.
2758909	2761670	And little does everybody know, but all the right side players had a hand in that.
2763931	2764071	Oh.
2764151	2764831	Right side pride.
2765771	2766271	Whatever.
2766471	2767031	Whatever.
2767992	2768572	Whatever.
2769672	2771313	Am I the only one that plays left side in here?
2771333	2771833	I think so.
2772033	2772453	Shit.
2772853	2773233	Shit.
2773553	2774114	I'm outnumbered.
2777225	2778625	I'm not the cheese, I'm the princess.
2778665	2779205	Alright, anyway.
2781046	2782906	I'm also a model and an actress.
2783426	2785747	I'm also a model and an actress, so fuck you too.
2786107	2792648	Anyway, Black Lab says, and he's making a pretty big claim here, Black Lab is going to enter Perfect Attack and beat Tigger.
2793068	2795708	He doesn't say he's going to win, he just says he's going to beat Tigger.
2797049	2798069	We need this on film.
2798089	2799069	Puppy's making a call.
2799549	2804910	And sadly enough, about 90% of the whole world is kind of, you know, hoping that would happen too.
2805774	2806534	No offense, Tigger.
2806654	2807115	Good guy.
2807215	2808915	Just, goddammit, lose for once.
2809416	2811917	You know, I still got giddy when you beat me.
2815839	2818380	I tried to be humble about that because I know it was a luck.
2818440	2819280	It was just total luck.
2819400	2820221	One great, it was luck.
2821381	2821901	You know what?
2821961	2824663	I only lost to Tigger by like 32 greats.
2825583	2826243	I was close.
2827224	2831506	It was like, you know, fingers, toes, fingers, and a couple toes.
2833281	2837443	I mean, we were playing Can't Stop Falling In Love, Speed Mix, and he got like 9, and I got like 40.
2838604	2840705	It was close, but he had it by a little bit.
2841065	2841606	Next time.
2841806	2847429	You know, just for the fun of it, I think that even I would enter this if I wasn't running half of it.
2848730	2849930	I would enter this contest.
2850511	2854013	Actually, I know somebody that's going to be entering, and I'm helping this person train.
2854493	2856334	So, you know, I'm pretty close, too.
2856894	2857955	So, we'll see what happens.
2858275	2861237	But this person will be entering DDR Idol, and it will be fabulous.
2861277	2861817	I guarantee it.
2863569	2863889	Ah.
2863949	2864810	So, anyway.
2865270	2866591	Do we want to do the FUs of the week?
2867011	2868312	Yes.
2868512	2869573	I need angst.
2869813	2872915	We need you to explain the FUs of the week because we have some new folks listening.
2872935	2873876	My God.
2875077	2877619	How much do you have to explain what the fuck you mean?
2877659	2881982	Just give the brief rundown of the, Jamie, I'm going to do it for you, the fuck yous of the week.
2882422	2882903	All right.
2883083	2883963	That made me happy.
2884724	2887966	Basically, this is where we talk about stuff that pisses us off.
2888347	2888727	The end.
2889187	2889627	Love, Jamie.
2891969	2894131	Alright, then on that note, let's get to it!
2901678	2903740	This is fucked up!
2903840	2909465	Um, my first fucking leak goes toward people who drive slow in front of me.
2910086	2913029	As in, like, the grandma from earlier today.
2913990	2917573	She had around her license tag, quilting keeps grandma off the road.
2918948	2919988	Why was she on the road?
2920088	2922089	And why was she taking off her wig in her car?
2922109	2925629	She's like, oh, I'm driving 20 miles an hour.
2925649	2927470	I'm going to take off my wig and scratch my head.
2927650	2930330	Oh, let me adjust.
2930430	2930910	Okay.
2931351	2934371	You know, I have nothing against old people.
2934431	2935291	Except the way they drive.
2935491	2938132	But I have things against old people who can't drive.
2938612	2948614	I think that when you reach like maybe 60 or so, you need to retake your full driving test to make sure that you are capable of operating your vehicle like the rest of the world.
2949688	2953451	The other thing on the other part of the week is for speed limit.
2953471	2956774	Why is it like 40 just a suggestion?
2957134	2961478	Because everybody else who goes down El Camino or Arden goes 50 to 5.
2961918	2963560	Or Fair Oaks in the morning on my way to work.
2966782	2969985	And the other thing goes toward the guy who sold us our car from the dealership.
2970446	2971506	I still don't have my title yet.
2971526	2973948	You know, I can try to get my title.
2974149	2976030	Although I'm not in a train, so...
2977802	2986211	Um, my other one goes toward, um, um, I forget.
2986231	2987793	Shermie for being a butt all weekend.
2988654	2989035	My cat.
2989495	2990316	My sweet baby.
2990656	2991978	Who's been a butt hole all weekend.
2992258	2993880	I mean, she's been a butt hole to me, too.
2994941	2996563	And my other one goes toward...
2997965	3004172	Um, our Neo Geo for having cords that are not, like, working properly to get the sun cut out and set my shirt on, too.
3005414	3008377	And, um, another one goes toward not having money.
3009498	3010479	Because I'm paying for my car.
3011500	3012940	Oh, and a really big fuck you.
3013360	3015021	And a few people know about this.
3015401	3019082	I've been trying to apply for a position at my old job as internally posted.
3019842	3025443	And under the terms of my displacement, I am eligible to apply for this job until March 17th.
3025503	3030965	Because I'm still considered technically an employee of the company, just not officially.
3031025	3031965	I'm a displaced employee.
3032785	3043249	Well, Julie, who was kind enough to send in all the stuff for me, gets an email or a call or something from one of the HR people and says, No, she can't apply for this because she has dyslexia.
3043269	3045630	What the hell, that completely contradicts my dyslexia.
3045950	3047570	So I'm going to call them and say this.
3048851	3055153	Okay, if I can't apply for this job, then you need to create a position for me like you did with... I won't say her name.
3055765	3056005	I'm all done.
3081707	3082367	Don't fuck with Jamie.
3104355	3108279	You make sure someone knows about it and you get it fixed because nothing changes until you make it change.
3108319	3110941	You're going to do something big enough to cover for those other eight people.
3111402	3111862	Exactly.
3112163	3112623	I'm sorry.
3113184	3116767	And I want to do what I can to make sure those other people get off their asses and take care of the business.
3117367	3120691	You know, I don't stand for that if I can help it.
3121131	3122032	Preach on, sister.
3123313	3123553	What?
3125255	3125835	I got a face.
3126096	3126576	F that face.
3126716	3127437	I'm done now.
3127497	3127797	Okay.
3128118	3129319	Let's move on to Loki.
3134278	3135278	I think this court's long enough.
3135639	3135959	Yeah.
3136179	3137239	Okay.
3137439	3140140	Well, the first one, the first FU I have has a story behind it.
3140260	3152603	Now, I read on Yahoo News there's this guy, he's doing the movie industry for all the trailers that they have on before the movie and the commercials, because, you know, most of the time it's like, say, 12.45, 12.51, or in this case, it was like 5 minutes or something like that.
3157403	3158863	Well, F you to that guy because you suck.
3158943	3161224	You can't wait fucking five minutes to see the damn movie.
3161404	3162725	I had to wait fucking 15 minutes to see the movie.
3162745	3162945	No, wait.
3163025	3163345	No, wait.
3163405	3164525	No, I agree with that guy.
3164545	3166086	F those commercials.
3166126	3166666	Hey, hey, hey.
3166806	3167086	Shut up.
3167126	3167486	Shut up.
3167566	3168546	Trailers are fine.
3168566	3169087	Shut up.
3169287	3170567	Okay, I haven't even gotten there yet.
3170587	3171227	Hey, F you.
3171547	3172267	No, listen.
3172588	3172988	This is my...
3174329	3175470	This is my time, okay.
3176030	3178252	So F you to that guy because you can't wait fucking five minutes.
3178272	3180274	And F you to the fucking viewers for putting commercials.
3180634	3181355	Then trailers.
3182076	3185158	In which case, then you've got, okay, this, okay.
3185198	3188521	Before Daredevil today, there was two fucking trailers for X-Men 2.
3189482	3190503	Right after each other.
3190903	3191284	Hello?
3192443	3194444	No, it's different trailers, but it's not the point!
3194584	3197286	The whole point is there's two fucking trailers of the same goddamn movie!
3197486	3200468	I didn't forget that I just saw a trailer right before the last one!
3201148	3204090	God, and F you to the stupid movie industry for continuity issues!
3204270	3204631	Hello!
3204851	3206332	Make your movies make sense!
3206592	3211495	When you see a reflection in someone's glasses the exact same way as looking at it, it doesn't make sense!
3212375	3218099	And they have, like, a part in Daredevil, okay, where they've got this chick and, um, Elektra and Daredevil fighting...
3218419	3230792	for no apparent reason, he met her, hi, how you doing, I don't like being touched, so they get in this fight scene and stuff happens for no reason, which fight scene are you talking about, when he first met her in the park.
3232122	3244713	F you to Wells Fargo for not sending me a fucking replacement card when mine expired and I had to wait, first I had to wait in line for 30 minutes while some stupid person's like, I don't want to wait in line for 5 minutes
3256543	3263050	So, you know, he left and then he came back and made another scene saying how he wants to get his money and they said no and then he left.
3263470	3267494	So I had to wait in line for that then to tell them, tell me to call 800 number to get my card.
3267954	3272519	What the fuck's the bank for if I, everything I need from, you know, the bank is through the 800 number?
3272739	3274080	Why the hell does a bank exist?
3274220	3275582	This is why Jamie makes it safe.
3276969	3281850	So, that's just stupid, so I called the number and, yeah, they were nice, at least on the phone number.
3282350	3286131	Um, F you to stupid old people, just because you're old and stupid.
3286791	3293993	And, uh, and F you to the Burger King, because no, I don't want to donate a fucking dollar to help children get wheelchairs.
3294293	3295554	They can rot in hell.
3296614	3299214	They were born defective, and they should die defective.
3299294	3301235	Oh my god, you're awful!
3301715	3303275	So, enough of that.
3305376	3305516	And...
3307636	3318412	I wonder if this means in the future when everyone has test tube babies, you know, I'm sorry my child arrived with this part wrong, can I just have an order replacement part?
3318933	3320516	Oh sure, we'll order it from the cloning farm.
3322885	3324166	Children will come with warranties.
3324846	3325687	God damn.
3327128	3327809	And you know what?
3327949	3334533	I don't care about all the stuff that's going on in the news, how they're talking about Saddam disarming, arming, doing whatever in Korea.
3335114	3337595	Well, seriously, does Korea want to get blown out of the sky?
3337615	3338416	I mean, seriously.
3338436	3340717	They're just like, hey, we're building nukes now.
3340757	3341658	Oh, sorry, we don't care about you.
3341698	3342619	We're talking about Iraq.
3342739	3344260	Well, we just fired a missile.
3344560	3345701	See, we can do that now.
3346101	3346942	We don't care about you.
3346962	3348183	Well, we're amassing an army.
3348443	3348603	What?
3348643	3350224	Do you want us to come over and nuke you?
3350485	3351405	Is that what you want?
3351505	3352566	Are you asking us to do it?
3352987	3355248	I mean, because I'm sure we'd be just fine with doing that.
3355909	3358591	I mean, seriously, it's like, hello, I'm here.
3358731	3359932	Hello, I'm North Korea.
3360012	3360573	Hello.
3361113	3362754	I mean, it's so stupid.
3362874	3364596	It's like, you're not even a full country.
3364676	3366377	You're a north part of a continent.
3367258	3368459	Or part of a continent.
3371331	3373051	Those are like the toenails of the continent.
3373091	3378572	Seriously, North Korea, that's like North Dakota attacking us.
3378633	3379413	It's stupid.
3381133	3381953	God damn it.
3382393	3386954	The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff.
3387234	3388935	And there is a missile silo in North Dakota.
3389195	3390495	Loki has funny angst.
3391475	3393556	God, I had other things.
3393656	3394536	Oh, oh yes.
3394856	3398277	An FB to my stupid Cypherbeat Nation pad.
3398357	3400237	Where are the fucking stupid pads I got?
3400817	3404200	Cypher Games, that's it, because they bend after one fucking game.
3404821	3408524	These nice pads, you know, fucking bent, like, instantly.
3409305	3411566	They're supposed to, you know, support 300 pounds.
3411787	3417572	I think if someone stepped on those 300 pounds, the pads would just, like, just disintegrate and be gone.
3418673	3422396	Oh, yeah, and one final FD to the movie industry.
3423477	3424518	I mentioned this before.
3425265	3431534	and I'm gonna say it again probably every week until this movie comes out and then after I see that movie just because I have to go make fun of it.
3432575	3438123	Listen, this whole continuity thing, the fucking movie The Core makes no fucking sense.
3439946	3441848	Okay, okay, The Core.
3443450	3445512	Here's the core, basically, a brief summary.
3446113	3450638	We developed this weapon to cause earthquakes to, you know, attack people.
3450859	3458027	Then, oh, somehow we stopped the core from spinning, which causes weird electrical storms and shit that destroys the world, and we have to jumpstart the core.
3458287	3460049	Well, how else do you think you jumpstart the core?
3460249	3460690	Oh, well, it's...
3461090	3489973	designed this vehicle to drill into the middle of the core and everything's solved with nuclear weapons so why not detonate a nuclear bomb and hope that everything's fine and then ride the giant shockwave with the molten lava that's going to engulf the whole thing and magically fly out through the surface of the earth and be fine while this magic guy who's played by DJ Qualls or whatever his name is that stupid nerdy guy from Road Trip he's going to hack the planet because he's the best hacker ever he can hack the planet he's going to hack the information coming out of the planet
3491762	3492383	and so on.
3514460	3517803	You know, stupid, out of, you know, fish out of water movies.
3518044	3518524	I hate them.
3519025	3520447	I hate them, and I wish you'd die.
3521548	3523290	We need more midget vampire movies.
3523670	3525052	I have one, yeah.
3525552	3526173	Midget porn.
3527415	3528236	Fuck midget porn.
3530238	3530558	Anyway.
3530598	3531620	Vampire midget porn.
3531660	3532561	Carpooling midgets!
3534633	3535494	Are you guys having a go?
3535995	3537077	Is that what you're up and ready to go?
3537117	3538339	Did you want to do FUs really fast?
3538379	3539080	I'll let you go first.
3540022	3540803	Did you want to do some FUs?
3542005	3546774	Alright, Melby and Sharkscrawl are having to get going pretty soon here, so I thought I'd let them step in and do some FUs of the week if they would.
3547867	3549609	All right, well, I'll make this one real short and sweet.
3549669	3554613	Apparently, I'm just not as passionate as these other people, but I do have an IP of the week.
3554953	3558596	It's to those people who are, like, totally anti-against this upcoming Pony campaign.
3558616	3563941	I don't know if any of y'all heard of it, but I guess Pony wants to have Jenna Jameson, of all people, be their spokesmodel.
3564281	3568425	Now, and, like, they're going to put billboards and everything all around SoCal and all that stuff.
3568445	3569546	There's just, like, this total...
3570646	3571907	I don't know why.
3572347	3575910	I mean, can't porn stars just get normal credibility like everyone else?
3575930	3577090	They want to be real actors.
3577110	3578211	They got feelings too.
3578891	3579732	Hell, I would.
3581213	3582253	I mean, I could see it right now.
3582374	3583654	After that, find Ron Jeremy.
3583954	3584935	He could be up on TV.
3585035	3587597	You know, me and a pony have one thing in common.
3588277	3588817	Ha!
3589338	3590198	Whips him right out.
3590619	3592740	And then, of course, you know, it comes down right to the shoes.
3593974	3602517	I don't know, that's just, I, you know, personally, that's just, I just don't get mad at the world very much, just when people hate porn, you know.
3604337	3604957	Porn is cool.
3605117	3607798	Go see Dream Quest.
3607918	3608298	It's cool.
3609719	3610259	Never mind.
3610279	3612619	Wow, anyway.
3612719	3614300	Sharks, do you have any FUs you'd like to give?
3614540	3615340	She's shaking her head no.
3615440	3617721	Well, how about any final thoughts before you guys have to head out?
3621207	3621787	Sorry, babe.
3622348	3624709	Okay, well, we'll see you next time.
3624729	3625669	You're going to come back and visit us.
3625870	3626930	We'll see you at March Madness, yes?
3627470	3629351	Actually, I don't know if I'll be here for March Madness.
3629472	3630752	I have Sharks tickets, I think.
3631292	3634674	And it's most likely I'm not bringing Sharks tickets this year.
3634694	3636415	So it's going to be the last game I get to see for a long time.
3636555	3640217	So I've blown off two different games to come see you guys.
3640778	3641698	All right, all right.
3641798	3642859	I can't do it this third time.
3643299	3643519	Okay.
3643539	3643879	I have to check.
3644259	3645140	I cry, but okay.
3645700	3646561	Okay, good.
3646701	3647841	Mel, any final thoughts for Mel B?
3649915	3653237	Moose are so nearsighted, they often try to mate with cars.
3654938	3656299	Wow, I did not know that.
3656339	3657240	Did you know that, Jamie?
3657840	3658460	Actually, yes.
3658821	3660602	God bless Cram.
3660922	3661963	Go watch Cram.
3662243	3663203	And we need to call the Cram.
3663223	3666405	We are going to be on Cram, and we're going to cover it for Orange Lounge Radio.
3666446	3667066	I can't wait.
3667186	3669648	They're going to put us at a storefront and make us stay up for 24 hours.
3669688	3670948	That's going to be freaking entertaining.
3671028	3678073	I could never do that, because that would be like reliving all of middle school, high school, and college.
3679446	3681469	That accounts for ten years of my life.
3682750	3684893	I'm not going to relive that ever again.
3688417	3691040	Shark Skull's back there explaining the concept of Cram the Loki.
3691140	3692642	Shall I just explain it to everybody?
3692662	3693002	Yes, please do.
3693022	3694444	Okay, it's a game show on the Game Show Network.
3694464	3697968	They showed it, like, depending on what feed you get, it's either 8 or 11 p.m.
3698008	3698389	weekdays.
3699153	3700375	The concept is this.
3701156	3701897	It's a trivia show.
3702157	3707524	They give you all the books, all the information you need, and you have to stay up for 24 hours straight.
3707544	3708405	You're not allowed to sleep.
3708586	3709587	You're in a storefront.
3709787	3710588	People can see in.
3710608	3712110	You can see them.
3712170	3715355	I've seen people making faces and doing entertaining things to the people outside.
3716067	3734860	and you have to read all these books and all this information and remember it and then they quiz you on it when you get on the show and make you do entertaining things like stand on like balance beams and stuff but mind you you haven't slept in over 24 hours so it's pretty fun to watch these people and then at the end if you actually make it and you're the winning team they have this lovely woman
3735450	3741595	who will tuck you into a nice warm bed and put a nice black eye cover on you and read you facts.
3741695	3745018	And she reads you facts in a voice like this.
3745658	3750082	Adolf Hitler and Mussolini both had venereal disease.
3750802	3753104	You are getting so sleepy.
3753465	3755426	And I'm just like, oh shit, I'd be gone.
3757027	3759570	And if you win, you have to answer five questions in a row, right?
3759610	3760190	And you get $10,000.
3760370	3762412	And I think we'd be fabulous.
3762472	3763733	Oh, I think Melody and I would take it all.
3763873	3765034	So we've got to get on there.
3766713	3770436	I think I would do okay at this, except for the fact that I don't want to.
3771857	3777700	Because when I was in college, every time an exam would come up, I wouldn't sleep for four days.
3778601	3781303	The most I stayed awake was five days in a row.
3782824	3784125	I worked during part of this.
3785266	3790389	I stayed up one night running D&D, actually two nights running D&D games while people were studying.
3791490	3794632	And I took all of my exams, did not make less than a B on them.
3795979	3800542	The last day, after all my exams, I'm sitting at my friend's house watching them on their computer.
3800562	3802483	Next thing I know, I'm in my dorm room, in bed.
3805285	3805925	Blink, blink.
3807386	3808827	Sounds like a bad sorority party.
3811009	3811809	I loved college.
3813310	3816832	Anyway, you know, whenever there's an opportunity that comes up to make an ass out of myself, I'm there.
3816952	3818554	So, you know, Melody, we gotta do it.
3818714	3820995	And hey, not only do you make an ass out of yourself, you get money for it.
3821015	3821796	Yeah, money, money, money.
3824017	3825278	I feel like they'll be asking me questions...
3830478	3831378	All right, well, bye, guys.
3831398	3832219	Thank you for coming.
3832699	3834059	Yay, we're so happy you guys came.
3834520	3839181	So we'll get back to the angst in just a minute here, but first some lovey-dovey hugs all around.
3839561	3840142	Hug, hug, hug.
3841462	3841502	Aw.
3843543	3844383	Thanks for coming.
3845204	3845544	Bye.
3845564	3846684	Have a safe trip back.
3846924	3847184	Later.
3847204	3847684	How you doing?
3848265	3849625	Big hug for Mel B. All right.
3850325	3850926	Ah, manly hug.
3851426	3851966	Bye.
3852906	3853267	All right.
3853287	3854227	Bye.
3854967	3855647	He said bye.
3858941	3860782	Mel B and Shark Skrull have left the building.
3861842	3863002	Okay, so back to the fuck you's then.
3864263	3864903	Where's your booze?
3865263	3866143	You don't get booze, you're driving.
3866163	3866623	It's your turn.
3867063	3868624	You can drink the drop sitter at the bottom of here.
3870904	3871345	Alright.
3872445	3873105	Moving on.
3875066	3876726	Alright, I have some FUs of the week.
3881447	3884128	Let's see, my first FU of the week goes to...
3886448	3894672	Irene, because Irene was rooting against me today in Mario Party 4, because she was just pissed off that I whooped her ass last night at Mario Party 4.
3895732	3899514	And so, of course, I won the game again, just to show you not to fuck with me in Mario Party.
3900595	3901195	Because I rule.
3902176	3902436	Anyway.
3903976	3910700	My other... My other FU of the week goes to Mardi Gras last night, because I'm not willing to do that for beats.
3912060	3912901	And I guess that's really it.
3913021	3915502	I guess that's all my... Oh, you... What?
3916414	3919536	Sadly enough, you guys almost convinced me to go with you.
3920676	3921037	Really?
3921577	3921977	Almost.
3922257	3923578	Until the beats thing?
3923818	3925299	Well, no, not the whole beats thing.
3925319	3927180	I was just really bored last night.
3927680	3929842	I ended up falling asleep working on my website.
3930122	3931122	It won't be the last time we go.
3931142	3932243	We'll go again.
3932683	3933624	I've never been there.
3934084	3934784	It's fun.
3934964	3939187	I've been hit on by gay guys before down at Sunday Night at the Rage.
3939567	3944450	You would probably get hit on by less people at this club than you would there, honestly, because enough straight people go there.
3952153	3966529	My other fuck you of the week that since Rob reminded me and one I brought up to Brad earlier today is that fuck you to everybody who uses the word Mardi Gras for an excuse to throw a party because first of all Mardi Gras means Fat Tuesday
3967225	3969866	That's the day before Ash Wednesday, right?
3970066	3970466	Right.
3971027	3976789	Okay, Mardi Gras is, the real ones are held in Mobile, which is where it started, where I'm from, Mobile, Alabama.
3977569	3980230	New Orleans, which is, you know, basically crap Mardi Gras.
3981211	3984052	For fraternity and sorority girls to end up on Girls Gone Wild.
3984432	3984692	Yeah.
3985052	3987513	Oh, I forgot to ask Melody when Guys Gone Wild's coming out.
3987994	3988314	Damn it.
3989114	3992095	Um, and they hold it in Biloxi, Mississippi.
3992615	3994536	I just have to ask, this is really, really important.
3994596	3996177	Loki, when does Guys Gone Wild come out?
3996542	3997262	Yeah, we want to know.
3998263	4001584	You know, actually, Guys Gone Wild was supposedly already out.
4001784	4006086	I've been trying to get the video, but I've had it on backorder for two months.
4007827	4008647	Guys going crazy.
4008847	4018292	I've had it on backorder for like two months now, and apparently the studio that we ordered it from is such a small studio that they won't take orders when we have so many titles on order.
4019592	4027180	I had another one also, girls going XXX wild, extra wild or something like that.
4027820	4036549	But the guy's going crazy from what I heard, it's just a bunch of video of guys getting head and stuff from women and stuff, I think.
4037561	4039742	I want to see guys getting head from other guys.
4040422	4041463	Okay?
4041583	4042463	Jamie, don't hold back.
4042823	4043523	Well, you know what?
4043963	4044404	You know what?
4044444	4048945	We can get you some... I can try... I know that they have some of those Vivid DVDs.
4049265	4051686	I had one at one point in my possession.
4051746	4055568	I think I ended up throwing it out when I moved, but we had one.
4055628	4056248	It was like...
4056741	4059323	They had, like, a bunch of, you know, guy fucking scenes.
4059343	4061705	They had one guy getting fucked by a machine type thing.
4062266	4062446	Ah!
4063367	4063607	Ah!
4064848	4066009	I don't want a guy on a robot.
4066089	4066489	Damn.
4066509	4071293	I wanted to tell you about the site that I found by accident, Man Machine.
4071874	4072635	Accident, huh?
4073095	4074256	No, it's real.
4074616	4081943	Alright, I was, okay, I was looking at Bill Jensche, but I found this one that, it was a link to this, and I think this site is down, I thought it was manmachine.com.
4083266	4090656	But it was these guys, like the first thing you see on this page is this guy attached to a machine with like this rotating thing of his ass.
4093235	4097839	and, you know, I couldn't, it was... Is that like the fleshlight?
4098640	4099060	I don't know.
4100261	4104225	But back to what I was saying, what was I saying?
4105266	4105926	Oh yeah, Mardi Gras.
4105966	4106727	Oh yeah, Mardi Gras.
4107107	4111411	That thing that you went to last night, I can't think that that was Mardi Gras.
4111471	4114334	No, it wasn't Mardi Gras, it was Show Your Dick, Get Some Beats Night.
4114674	4115034	Yeah.
4116115	4119759	See, I would only show any of my body parts
4120942	4123764	If there was a lot of money involved and nobody else was there.
4125505	4128727	Turn off all the lights, give me a million dollars, flash!
4129067	4130168	You know, flash in the night.
4134811	4138033	I'm glad you brought the show back to Bomani because we kind of forgot our roots there for a minute.
4138053	4140034	Flash in the night, in the dark where no one can see.
4140054	4145237	Oh yeah, because we've got to finish the segment now because it's already been going for about 40 minutes.
4147379	4149100	Let's start with the intern, Ryan, what's up?
4150905	4151947	I've only got a couple, really.
4154191	4154813	Shut up!
4154873	4156075	I'm saying an FU.
4157297	4157678	FU.
4158259	4158399	Oh.
4159542	4160503	No, like, one I got is...
4162544	4168290	FU to all the little kids and the one adult who decided it would be a good idea to run across the crosswalk on DDR.
4168591	4179282	And for people who don't know what the crosswalk is, we gave it the name basically because there's the machine and a lot of places have that wood piece between the panels and the machine.
4181324	4184445	So kids decided to run across there over and over and over again.
4184886	4185766	And we had an adult.
4185806	4194229	Last night I was playing over at Scandia and some little kid got up on there when I was doing doubles and I knocked the kid like four feet off the panel.
4194249	4195990	His dad just laughed at him though.
4197389	4198710	No, that's cool.
4198990	4200351	Because I said, I feel really bad.
4200651	4202352	And he's all, no, don't worry about it.
4202412	4203492	I told him not to go up there.
4204653	4206294	That guy gets the parenting award of the week.
4206534	4206874	Yeah.
4207575	4208355	It was really cool.
4208455	4214259	And another one is, fuck you to people who think it is the coolest idea to stand behind you.
4214279	4216160	You're like, what the hell?
4216780	4217460	Okay.
4220662	4221843	This is not Miss America.
4221943	4223104	Stop balancing things on your head.
4223124	4223664	I got one.
4223784	4224424	It goes a little...
4227415	4229396	It kind of goes along with your movie thing.
4229857	4235661	There's a story in this movie that I just saw a few years ago about a guy who kills people with rats.
4237805	4239506	That is the weirdest idea ever.
4240928	4244010	It seems just off the wall in a way that sucks.
4244030	4244791	That's all I'm gonna say.
4244811	4245611	I don't have anything to add.
4246452	4248374	One more F you and this goes to Scandia.
4248474	4249975	Actually this goes to the kids of Scandia.
4250856	4251236	Alright.
4252177	4259062	If I have to listen to you go WHOO WHOO every time a fucking whistle song comes out, I'm gonna kill you!
4259963	4262345	They did that for like four fucking hours!
4264005	4269887	We were in the top secret meeting room and we heard whoop whoop and Keith was like, oh yeah, they're playing the list of songs.
4270487	4272568	They did that every game, like twice.
4273708	4280751	Oh my god, I wanted to go have my lunch break and these people, I came in like three hours later to take my 20 minute break, these people were still in there doing this shit.
4281171	4282812	It was driving me crazy.
4283312	4286253	I remember it was cool when you thought about it and didn't do it.
4286273	4286393	Yeah.
4286413	4287693	That was about it.
4287993	4288354	Yeah.
4289194	4289394	Like,
4290925	4293286	That's what they've been doing, yeah.
4320601	4324029	Don't make fun of that, because some people used to do that.
4324049	4325312	It really wasn't me or anything.
4325332	4325432	Here.
4332839	4334980	I have a couple fuck yous to make.
4335400	4337901	Wait, wait, because I had one more I needed to do, and then we can go to yours.
4337961	4339501	Okay, here's my FU.
4340242	4341102	My other FU of the week.
4341122	4341782	This was a good one.
4342282	4347024	Okay, a bunch of us were standing all around just outside of the party room, kind of by the 2DX machine.
4347184	4350745	Myself, Jamie, Irene, Brad, and Keith, Scandia Tech.
4351166	4354787	We were all sitting around outside the party room.
4354807	4357728	We were just kind of all standing there, and we're talking, da-da-da-da-da.
4357988	4360769	You know, we're having a good time, and then all of a sudden I hear this voice behind me.
4361329	4362510	Excuse me!
4363611	4366953	Yeah, this lady just all of a sudden out of nowhere, she's like, excuse me!
4367033	4369854	And we all turn around and she's just, she's trying to get by.
4369934	4373897	She didn't try to like tap anyone on the shoulder, just kind of like, even kind of like go and try to get by.
4374157	4375958	She just went, excuse me!
4377239	4383443	And so she walked away and when she was, when she was kind of like out of sight but still within hearing distance, I went, you're excused!
4384784	4386525	And she turned around and gave me the dirtiest look in the world.
4386645	4386845	Anyway.
4388520	4389761	Irene said the best thing, though.
4390522	4391403	Are you on your period?
4392984	4395727	I was like, no, it must be the day before.
4401474	4402475	All right, Johnny, yes.
4402736	4402996	Yes.
4403497	4409003	Johnny Bombay has a couple of fuck you's to make that are really, like, legit.
4409083	4411827	These are legit fuck you's, not something that I saw irritating me.
4411847	4413188	These are, like, legit fuck you's.
4413849	4418515	I have a fuck you, okay, a couple at Scania.
4418595	4420638	Not so much at Scania, but...
4421538	4424660	There are a few employees there that I need to say fuck you to.
4425041	4427863	I was in LA a couple days ago and I bought a watch there.
4428343	4431645	And I took it to my job.
4432126	4433306	I had it in my backpack.
4433807	4435608	I put my backpack down in our break room.
4436235	4442979	I go in there, when I get off, I clocked out, I was ready to leave, I go in there to get it, and my watch is gone.
4443219	4446441	The only people allowed in the break room are employees.
4447221	4451683	Now, one of my fucking co-workers took my fucking watch, and I will kill you.
4451963	4455345	If it's my fucking manager, I don't give a fuck, I will kill you.
4455926	4457687	I don't care if it's Paul.
4458047	4458347	No way.
4460089	4461050	Wait, no, wait, wait.
4461330	4462211	No, wait, Paul, yeah.
4462271	4465513	The views and opinions expressed on Orange On Radio.
4465653	4467154	Yeah, yeah, Paul, never mind.
4467455	4468235	Paul, you can keep it.
4468335	4469136	It's a present.
4469676	4470337	Okay.
4471017	4475461	And, uh, okay, also, fuck you to some more fuck yous.
4475481	4486629	Like, there are a lot of little kids there that are really immature, like, with the go-karts and everything, and it's like, nobody knows how to drive a go- it's like, it's so weird how people do not know how to drive a go-kart.
4487129	4489331	All you have to do is gas and brake, gas and brake.
4490109	4496713	We had some, we had, we had, fuck you to some senior citizens that came and rode go-karts at my job.
4497173	4499495	They were the slowest go-kart riders in the world.
4501976	4502697	It was so funny.
4503277	4508200	You should have said, I know, you think they might have sped up, but no, it was all slow.
4510642	4511442	That's pretty much it.
4512743	4515885	Alright, Dave, give us some FUs, really fast, this chatroom's getting restless.
4516365	4522507	Okay, um, well, I don't really have that many, just FU'd all the things that make me have to drive slower.
4522868	4534153	Like speed limits, old people, the fear of cops, fast turns, shitty tires, and stoplights, all that stuff.
4534413	4534993	They're bad.
4536914	4539935	Because I try, yeah, okay, that's a lot of people.
4542529	4544831	Hey, I'm not one of them, I'm not one of them, okay.
4545191	4555259	No, um, and fuck you to not being able to turn fast enough, because, like, I was trying to go 50 in a residential area, and the tires started squealing hella bad.
4558321	4558841	I couldn't go 60.
4562484	4571071	No, and so, um, that's basically it, and F you to not being able to see into Jamie's car, because the light didn't seem to be working or something.
4572288	4578394	And so I had to search around in the dark for like two minutes to try to find what I was looking for and then how to lock the car because I couldn't figure it out.
4578835	4579355	But that's it.
4579455	4579896	Okay, Rob.
4579956	4581217	Alright, chatroom FUs.
4581417	4582198	I'm gonna run through these.
4585121	4585701	Bruheimer.
4586402	4588124	Fuck the snow for never fucking ending.
4588204	4595531	Fuck my swim team for having a boring ass social which I unfortunately attended only one to find that there were four people above the age of 15 there, me being one.
4595711	4596392	Fuck potheads.
4598553	4604425	Skyline says, I'm sorry, SkylineDC505 says, F you to initial D for making me broke, again.
4609122	4611163	23rd Magus says, Hey, that was four.
4630269	4631750	I have one more fuck you.
4631790	4637934	Fuck you to myself for making one of the hardest DWIs ever because I'm an asshole.
4638014	4642817	I made a DWI to hot limit that is really impossible.
4643057	4643917	So fuck you to myself.
4645797	4646578	It makes no sense.
4646858	4647418	Alright, moving on.
4647438	4649199	And stop making bad remixes.
4649539	4650080	Please.
4650300	4655283	Just because you know how to chop samples and put them next to each other doesn't mean you know how to remix.
4655563	4658945	Fuck you to this song because I just started doing the Samba de Amiga stuff to it.
4659445	4661606	The song rules and you still need to give me my porn.
4661987	4662287	Alright.
4662347	4663147	Like a long time ago.
4664648	4668411	The chatroom, okay, chatroom actually said, shut up, it's our turn.
4668432	4672415	Dude, my, dude, no, no, uh, Garrett?
4672915	4677239	No, SkylineDC505 needs... No, he didn't say that, he just, somebody else did, but it's funny.
4677259	4680742	No, look up farther, look up farther, it says it, uh, he needs... Moving on, moving on.
4680902	4681203	Anyway.
4681443	4682123	DarkTetsuya.
4683705	4687408	Hello, DarkTetsuya says, fuck the fact that girls don't want to talk to him.
4688249	4689390	Aww, girls want to talk to you.
4691051	4691532	DarkTetsuya.
4694253	4694933	You bitch!
4695033	4695754	I'm sorry.
4696414	4697514	You know I'm teasing.
4698254	4700855	I like our DT.
4700935	4703856	Fuck the initial D machine at CCL for being broken again.
4704576	4704916	What?
4708397	4709557	You are so mean.
4709677	4709978	Alright.
4710778	4711598	You know if I'm joking.
4711798	4714839	Sautome Ranma says, hey, I have... You pronounced it right.
4715199	4715419	What?
4715539	4716379	You pronounced it right.
4716679	4717059	Holy shit.
4717099	4718860	Rob pronounced something right in Japanese.
4718920	4719580	Oh my god.
4720080	4721881	My eyes are slanting as we speak.
4722061	4722341	Okay.
4726843	4728364	Loki in the back is going, Rob, you're getting shorter.
4728684	4736167	Anyway, I only have one F you, and it's to everyone that lies about their DDR accomplishments.
4736287	4737187	Pisses me off.
4737628	4740589	Everyone who lies about their DDR accomplishments.
4741029	4742510	You mean like Triple A and We Will Rock You?
4743750	4745011	I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
4746241	4750563	Um, Feh, sorry about the whole whore typing thing, I'm sleepless.
4750803	4752103	Oh, I have a second, fuck you.
4752563	4758966	It's all these secret spy camera pop-ups that have nearly, but not nearly naked women.
4759826	4763228	As in, they're not clothed, nor naked, but painfully in the middle.
4763588	4764008	Fuck that!
4764608	4765468	Go to J-List.
4765588	4773011	If you want to see boobs, if you want to see boobs and twat that's on the site that's not even a porn site, just go to J-List.com and look at the DVD section.
4773051	4775092	Just go to... Persian Kitty, for Christ's sake.
4775112	4776832	What's great is all those hidden camera sites.
4776912	4779353	Okay, the hidden camera things are for, like, security only.
4779733	4784075	So I never knew that I had naked models or close to naked models on my lawn.
4784715	4786436	Like, hours of the day that I don't realize.
4786476	4788197	But if I had a hidden camera, I would.
4788797	4789097	I'm done.
4789537	4792018	I actually do have one more fuck you, and that is to J-List.com.
4792708	4796592	I'm looking for a copy of Battle Royal on JList.com.
4797312	4800575	Instead, I have to look through so many pictures of boobs and twat, okay?
4801096	4804319	If I want to see boobs and twat, I'll actually go looking for porn, for real porn.
4808804	4819578	Ninja Usagi Koi I want to send an FU to whoever broke the fan in our arcade.
4819698	4824564	A big FU to our arcade manager for raising the price and not fixing the machine so it breaks for two weeks.
4825044	4829733	Then when it does get fixed, have to dish out $2 and die after the first round from the sheer heat.
4829753	4832157	That is way too freaking much for DDR.
4832197	4834120	You'll just be playing at the Metreon or something.
4834781	4837687	Yeah, at either the Metreon or at a convention or something.
4839565	4847891	Okay, uh... SnubDistinoid says, Fuck anyone that sees the magical invisible crosswalk of space between the DDR pads and the machine.
4847931	4848631	I failed an Oni.
4849171	4855276	Matchhead got fucked up and Zero actually accidentally ran into a kid just because people have a fascination with fucking us up.
4855716	4858658	I don't care if I look stupid or if I suck, I just don't want to step on a kid.
4858938	4859358	Or do I?
4859578	4864502	That, like, really sucked, too, because he was doing really good on the Oni, then some stupid little girl walked in front of the screen.
4864522	4867804	She didn't run, she took her sweet time and, like, stood there.
4868244	4869225	Like a friggin' moron.
4871511	4877788	We're gonna have to take to the tactics that we used to have at RVGL, where people would stand on either side of the machine.
4879033	4881415	That's actually what we started doing in the last half.
4881515	4886538	Matchhead was there, and he was there, and I was there, and we were just standing on both sides of the machine.
4886558	4893363	I think we should get, like, caution tape or something, and put it right there, and have the only way you can get in between the bars, because that would save a lot of trouble.
4894403	4902469	I will give another Scandia shirt to somebody, and we could just, I'll just give it to everybody, and we could just stand on each side, or they're wearing a Scandia shirt.
4902529	4904270	With the arms folded, looking intimidating.
4904310	4904790	Yeah, exactly.
4904850	4905951	Okay, moving on with this FU.
4905991	4907652	Did Ned expect us to fix the machine?
4908012	4908613	I don't remember how.
4909173	4912874	Oh, and fuck you to the kids who would not stop playing the whistle song.
4912914	4914935	That song is horrible.
4915435	4919396	And the guttural noises that they were screaming out made me ashamed of being an Aerosmasher.
4919496	4920396	Fuck them right in the ear.
4920917	4922557	That's all, surprisingly less than last week.
4922597	4922857	P.S.
4922877	4925058	Scandia was fun yesterday, but there were entirely too many people there.
4926738	4930099	RYC3 Rice says, fuck you to the bad weather in SoCal.
4930199	4935141	Fuck you local LA arcade owners for not believing you can't unlock songs on Extreme just by playing.
4935361	4935761	Hi guys!
4937659	4937999	Hi!
4938540	4946306	Daft Square says, F you damn Cali bastards who get all the awesome Bomani stuff while we Easterners take it in the butt as far as Bomani goes.
4946766	4948567	I'm jealous of you lucky sons of bitches.
4949108	4950129	Then move out here like I did.
4950689	4954132	Hey, I gave up my life and got on a plane.
4954172	4955913	Of course, it was before there was Bomani out here.
4956053	4958655	But the East Coast has hurricanes and snow.
4961557	4963459	And planes are going to skyscrapers.
4964099	4964760	And terrorists...
4966454	4967534	Lower gas prices, though.
4971376	4973037	Snow, lots of snow.
4974317	4977799	At least we don't have to pay like 20 bucks just to get to the arcade.
4979439	4981820	But also keep in mind that food is taxed there.
4985081	4986022	Alright, moving on.
4991377	4992338	The guys are off.
4992379	4993700	Loki, you are off the hook tonight.
4994121	4997685	Okay, Black Lab says, Fuck the horrible dining hall food.
4998046	4999508	Fuck the boring city of Davis.
4999688	5000068	Davis?
5000289	5000669	Davis?
5000930	5002311	I almost said Danish.
5002331	5003613	The People's Republic of Davis.
5004814	5008077	and fuck cheaters in online games and fuck boredom.
5008317	5009898	I thought that was the purpose of online games.
5011119	5014301	Yeah, but he's also part of staff, so he's allowed.
5014642	5020166	JB, Justin Circuit, says F you to airplanes, not being the speed of light so I can get my customized CD quicker.
5020886	5023848	Fuck Sky for playing the not-full version of Irresistible Men.
5026030	5027251	Fuck you too, I'll do what I want, bitch.
5028027	5030548	FU to my mom for making me clean my room that's still messy.
5031509	5033150	FU for making me FU's only three.
5034370	5035991	And then he says play a song.
5037732	5040513	The song I'm sending now is an excellent cover of I'm Like a Bird.
5041634	5042495	I don't know, we might have to try that.
5042515	5043575	We've dedicated this to Rob.
5043855	5044736	It's Rob's diva day.
5044776	5045476	Alright, we'll try that.
5045516	5045916	We'll try that.
5045936	5046777	We'll play that next break.
5047257	5056862	Okay, VidPowah says, FU to dumb workers who can't properly put up a restaurant sign and have only three-fourths of the letters light up while practically the rest of the entire mall has perfectly lit up signs.
5062717	5074265	Jay Kinetic, our favorite Jay Kinetic says Fuck you to Stone Cold Steve Often for coming back to the WWE I can't watch Raw Or is it Smackdown, the more suited show for Stone Cold
5074608	5077030	He got tired of beating his wife, so now he has to beat on wrestlers.
5077070	5077450	Hold on.
5077751	5080493	For coming back, slapping your wife in anger is never okay.
5080973	5085337	Fuck you to every scrub at Southland Mall tonight who couldn't play any song besides Orion 7-8.
5086017	5087038	Dang, that's like a year ago.
5087999	5089920	With Orion 7-8 getting played all the time.
5090781	5092863	Fuck you to the guy who made pop-up porn.
5092923	5096866	I don't give a shit about your sister getting ass raped violently by a horse while you shit on her face.
5097507	5099368	If I wanted prawn, I'd go to PersianKitty.com.
5100649	5101529	as I recommended earlier.
5103210	5106070	Jay Kinetic also says, Fuck you to bitch-ass roommates who don't do their dishes.
5106130	5109751	I work 40 hours a week and I still have a way to work out, wash dishes, and bullshit on the internet.
5109771	5115613	Fuck you to world discounters for some of the most ghetto, fake, crass, and bullshit stuff for high prices.
5115833	5121874	And F you to HappyHackers.com for taking down their backdoor section so now I can't get free porn from them.
5125709	5128590	And on that note, I think we finally exhausted the FUs of the week.
5128630	5129471	I have a request.
5129551	5130171	Oh, Jesus.
5130751	5131952	No, no request for a song.
5132292	5132592	Oh, what?
5132632	5134873	And this is important.
5135093	5141116	Later this week, we have lost one of our most beloved childhood entertainers.
5142297	5145038	Mr. Rogers died this week.
5145058	5148059	That was very sad.
5148079	5149420	So we have the Mr. Rogers theme.
5149480	5150700	I think we should play it during the break.
5151000	5151441	Let's see.
5153883	5157846	It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood, a beautiful day in the neighborhood.
5194828	5196550	You were already fucking it up.
5196770	5198612	It's a beautiful day for a neighborhood.
5198632	5199893	It's a beautiful day for a neighborhood.
5199913	5200794	Would you be mine?
5201055	5202816	Yeah, it's not a beautiful day for a neighborhood.
5202836	5203938	Then could you be mine?
5205246	5207087	Alright, chat room, send it to us.
5208288	5213272	First of all, I have perfect pitch, and hearing this many people off-key is giving me a headache again.
5213432	5216814	If no one brings it, then I'll just bring it next time.
5216854	5219356	Okay, all of you are now Politary, so shut up.
5219996	5222378	For I'd beat you like Politary.
5225960	5226940	One last comment.
5227640	5229261	One last comment before we go to break.
5230021	5233802	And as the chat room is saying, we're disgracing the memory of a living saint.
5233822	5236562	It's like manny faces, remember, from He-Man?
5237482	5237882	Let's see.
5238502	5240683	Satomi Ranma says, Hey, look, it's me.
5240823	5244764	I just wanted to comment that Battle Royale is the most traumatizing movie I've ever seen.
5245224	5246464	I recommend it wholeheartedly.
5246524	5247184	It made me cry.
5247284	5250285	I don't know how they based a movie on kids killing each other, but they did it.
5250765	5251825	But you should buy it anyways.
5252325	5262855	Battle Royal is actually, and I found out more about this, is basically was sent as a statement to Japanese children, because actually school violence has gotten to be at a pretty big high.
5263756	5266859	And Japan said they made this to show the extreme side of violence in school.
5267360	5275668	Yeah, just like Series 7 said F you to the reality shows, and after Series 7 came out, so did tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons of reality shows.
5276229	5276910	So that didn't work.
5277030	5278311	And they're making a second Battle Royale.
5279692	5280893	Number two, coming out soon.
5281193	5282595	I have the first one, and it was awesome.
5282915	5287239	Especially the guy that goes around and kills everybody, because he's awesome, and then he gets killed in the end.
5288239	5288980	Yeah, it's awesome.
5291002	5296427	Jay Kinetic says, we fucked up the Mr. Rogers song so bad, it's as bad as George Bush not knowing the words to Jingle Bells.
5298428	5300710	Strong Mad forgets the lyrics to his favorite songs.
5301030	5302831	Anyway, okay, we're going to go to a break.
5302851	5305973	We're going to play that song JB says should be dedicated.
5306493	5309355	JB says we should play and Jamie says should be dedicated to me.
5309395	5311516	This is Sheldon with I'm Like a Bird, the dance remix.
5314098	5316079	That loud popping noise was brought to you by Propel.
5316399	5316559	Ow.
5317259	5317980	All right, we'll be back.
5590515	5590835	All right.
5590935	5591496	All right, everybody.
5591696	5591916	Okay.
5592416	5595579	Now, thanks to Akuma GM, we have the real thing.
5595879	5601443	So since you guys fucked it up so bad, myself included, sorry, here's your chance to study.
5601763	5603004	So there will be a quiz later.
5603124	5607067	So now, in memorandum of a living saint, here you go.
5607587	5608648	A moment of silence, please.
5608668	5612090	Okay.
5618311	5621116	Thanks for watching!
5641619	5645943	It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood, a beautiful day for a neighbor.
5646323	5648064	Would you be mine?
5648265	5650467	Could you be mine?
5650607	5655131	It's a neighborly day in this beauty wood, a neighborly day for a beauty.
5655591	5657413	Would you be mine?
5657473	5659875	Could you be mine?
5660055	5663058	I have always wanted to have a neighbor just like you.
5665199	5679327	I've always wanted to live in the neighborhood with you So let's make the most of this beautiful day Since we're together, we might as well say Could you be mine?
5679347	5680668	Could you be mine?
5680908	5682789	Won't you be my neighbor?
5682809	5686411	Won't you please?
5686451	5687751	Won't you please?
5688512	5691453	Please won't you be my neighbor?
5695131	5698495	My television neighbor, I'm glad we're together again.
5834161	5834866	Kale Kale Kutta
5891621	5892481	Hi, we're back.
5892581	5895182	I have food in my mouth.
5917691	5918751	I'm eating these combos.
5918851	5919591	Everybody left.
5920492	5922072	I haven't had combos in a long time.
5922972	5925433	And I swear to God, this is some of the most addicting shit in the world.
5926033	5927834	You know what I know is more addicting than those to me?
5927874	5930115	Well, actually, when I was in middle school, do you know what the snack was?
5930555	5930775	What?
5931235	5932396	The Everlasting Gobstopper.
5934576	5936517	No, but we used to take them out to see what color they changed.
5937586	5938807	That was the coolest.
5939047	5940328	And I liked it when they were in the middle.
5940768	5941429	And you know what?
5941929	5946032	I love all of you from Starmen.net because I want Mother64 to come out.
5946072	5949515	I was just about to say, we have all these new people in the chat room tonight.
5949535	5951076	I was trying to figure out where the hell they're all from.
5952056	5957080	And then I looked and somebody mentioned a site that they were all from, Starmen.net.
5957780	5960062	And then it's like, oh my god, it's an Earthbound site.
5960302	5961423	I love Earthbound.
5961703	5964885	Like, seriously, I almost love Earthbound more than I do DDR.
5965206	5966166	Earthbound was the shit.
5966206	5966727	You know what?
5967967	5979695	By the way, for people who actually have emulators, I've heard this, because I know that the guy who did Robotech Crystal Dreams has as much of the game that they had programmed out in ROM format for these emulators.
5980115	5983378	I have been hearing that there was a prototype ROM for Mother 64.
5984480	5984740	Right.
5985260	5989181	And I've been looking for it, so if any of you have it, please freaking send it to me.
5989281	5990661	They have a little section here on EB64.
5991202	5991742	Let me click.
5991782	5992542	I'm clicking here.
5993522	5997123	That they were going to plan a sequel, and there's little cute little screenshots.
5999103	6000263	Why the hell didn't this come out?
6000824	6001504	F Nintendo.
6001764	6003464	Why aren't we getting one of these on GameCube?
6004644	6006925	You know what frustrated me is every time I started Earthbound...
6007765	6008426	Animal Crossing Town, Onet
6028576	6029357	Really, that's cool.
6029617	6033902	Now that's, that was the shit when Ness was, ended up being in Smash Brothers.
6034503	6036485	Cause I own with Ness and Smash Brothers.
6036505	6038687	You know, I'm starting my non-soda drinking tomorrow.
6039568	6042852	All you have to do is sit there and you just PK fire the shit out of everybody.
6042872	6043793	PK fire!
6045595	6050480	Which reminds me, they're having a sale on Super Smash Brothers right now for like 29 bucks at Fry's and I'm so excited.
6053379	6054479	Oh, guess what?
6054539	6056939	They sent us the biggest joke in the universe for free.
6057440	6057660	What?
6057700	6058900	A request for PS2.
6060400	6063821	See, that's the great thing about my man managing GameStop.
6064461	6066562	Because we get free crap games for free.
6066982	6070483	Like, we got BMX XXX for free.
6070923	6072423	And then they sent us Evercrack.
6073144	6074024	And I'm laughing at it.
6076584	6078185	Loki's asking if you can borrow BMX XXX.
6082535	6086138	When people in here don't talk with microphones, it's hard for the folks to understand what's going on.
6087098	6089120	Can I borrow a BMX Triple X?
6089860	6090321	Much better.
6090341	6091321	Only if you have an Xbox.
6093263	6094243	You can come over and play, though.
6095364	6097646	We actually have some of the stripper stuff unlocked.
6100488	6100828	Anyway.
6101488	6104170	Oh, another neat thing for all of you who have a GameCube.
6104911	6106512	A little device called the Freeloader.
6107449	6109010	The freeloader is a little disc.
6109251	6112033	It works like the one that they had for the Dreamcast.
6112593	6117558	You put in your disc, you load the disc, then you put in your Japanese game, and lo and behold, it works!
6118398	6122042	And you don't have to need dinky little switches in the back of your GameCube.
6122522	6125384	So that's why I got to see Zelda before everybody in this room.
6128047	6128687	It's cool.
6131329	6133912	Actually, no, unless you've been playing the demo at GameStop.
6136778	6143980	But no, it's actually, I thought that I was gonna, see I was still feeling, you know, a little bit weird about that game just because Link looks like a dork.
6145120	6149281	But when you see the game in action, it's so freaking cool.
6149921	6156283	And like, you're in the dungeon and the, you know, to cross like the lava, you throw bottles of water at the lava and it cools it.
6156603	6158583	And you can ride them up jets of lava, it's so cool.
6160184	6166225	I was telling you about Dark Cloud earlier, that was another thing I was cool about is all the dungeons are randomly generated throughout the game.
6167874	6180602	Of course, right now I'm still trying to go back and finish Final Fantasy X, because I have this habit with any Final Fantasy game that I rush all the way through it just because I play really smart when I play.
6181503	6190949	Now I'm at the first Unalesca battle, and well, you know, Auron is at 4,000 hit points, Tidus is at 2,100.
6192290	6192870	And you know what?
6193010	6193811	That's way too little.
6193871	6195912	I'm supposed to be at, what, 6,000 hit points by now.
6196465	6196685	Xenosaga
6213237	6219783	I saw Xenosaga last year at March Madness, coming to think of it, when I was staying at Tyzone.
6220163	6227770	I saw the incredibly long cinematic intro to Xenosaga, and I was absolutely uninterested in it.
6227830	6231553	I thought it was pretty, but I'd never played Xenogears, so Xenosaga means nothing to me.
6231653	6235317	Xenosaga does nothing like Xenogears, though.
6235877	6240808	Other big news is, uh, Konami changed their logo.
6242291	6244817	And they lost their stupid little red yellow flag.
6247034	6250097	It was cool, like, the little walkie guy was cool.
6250257	6257282	It was, like, at the beginning of Dracula X2, also known in the U.S., and none of us who ever had the game in the U.S.
6257362	6265909	knows about this, for Castlevania Symphony of the Night, for the Japanese one, the Japanese Konami logo, the two little squiggly lines walk across the screen and it goes do-do-do-do-do-do.
6266009	6269352	Isn't that, that was also the same in Beat Mania 2nd, also.
6269532	6269772	Yeah.
6269913	6270853	That's where I saw it.
6270873	6271914	I thought it was a cool thing.
6271994	6272354	But, um...
6273275	6279577	And actually, a little Baymani reference to this, the song, what was it, Make a Jam?
6280797	6285318	The effects in that song are taken from the little walking Konami logo thing.
6285719	6286219	That's cool.
6286659	6286959	Yeah.
6287039	6290760	Like, Konami's new logo is about as exciting as Namco's logo.
6291320	6294421	Okay, Namco all by itself is cool because of Pac-Man.
6294681	6297562	I know, but the logo is so boring.
6298458	6301741	Konami's new logo is about as exciting as watching cheese ferment.
6302482	6305524	It's about as exciting as the Jaguar.
6306425	6309007	It's about as exciting as this radio program.
6309187	6309908	Virtual Boy.
6310949	6314331	Okay, Virtual Boy is more exciting than the new Konami logo.
6315072	6320136	Because, okay, the Virtual Boy gives me a headache.
6320296	6322118	The new Konami logo makes me want to throw up.
6323107	6329033	In other news, Poppin' Music 9 came out and it's cool.
6329533	6338061	Poppin' Music Best Hits also is out with brand new V-Rare CD number 4, which is also cool.
6340373	6347917	and the Absolute guitar version is supposed to be on New Poppin' Music and also there's new Des Rho songs.
6348517	6350719	Des Rho being the person that I can tie.
6350979	6354901	I did get the long version of that rock version of Absolute so we'll play that next break.
6355361	6355741	Yeah.
6356742	6357022	Oh yeah.
6360615	6366178	Okay, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air.
6366198	6371521	Can somebody download the Death Row songs and like set me up with them?
6371541	6375843	Because all I have is Daikin Kai and I want to hear more stuff by them, but I can't download 30 megabytes on a 56K.
6375863	6377264	Let me know where and I'll do it.
6377384	6378125	Let me know where and I'll do it.
6379266	6384491	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6398968	6400130	We had crumpling noises.
6400430	6401471	What the hell was that?
6401972	6409221	I keep moving the fucking cord over goddamn food that's in the middle here because it's about to tip over, and so I just move the food instead, you know.
6410743	6411584	Being proactive.
6413466	6414267	Ness for president.
6416570	6417632	You poor deprived child.
6419042	6432588	Dude, whatever happened to that guy, um, whatever happened to the guy that used to be on the Nintendo show, that guy, the Nintendo show, the guy with the zapper, the zapper guy.
6432608	6434689	Captain N. Captain N, whatever happened to him?
6434809	6443793	I downloaded the episode of Captain N where he went to the Zelda universe, and it had Link and Zelda, but they were, like, much taller, but it was the same voices.
6444617	6445137	That was cool.
6445517	6454662	But the episode sucks because I cannot go back and watch Captain N now that I know so much more about the background stories of these characters because Simon Belmont, okay, they had him as being this pretentious asshole.
6455302	6459504	When he's really supposed to be all honorable, I'm a vampire hunter and I'm a Belmont and damn, I'm cool.
6459564	6460184	Fuck that, dude.
6460264	6462045	You know what's going to be awesome is that fucking movie.
6462065	6462826	Mega High, by the way.
6463166	6464746	Van Helsing, the movie.
6464866	6465607	It's going to be awesome.
6465627	6465807	Ooh.
6466812	6474554	Like, wasn't the Captain N, didn't they play that during that horrible show where they'd have the two people compete in video game contests?
6474574	6476235	No, Captain N was its own show.
6476535	6480156	Oh, because I remember they had a show where they did that.
6480176	6484497	Captain N was even okay for a while, but they jumped the shark when they introduced Game Boy.
6484517	6485037	Oh my god.
6485637	6486477	As a person.
6488978	6492459	No, it was a Game Boy, and they would ride the Game Boy like a flying carpet.
6493875	6496837	and NakedMan would always say Mega High and Kid Icarus was stupid.
6497318	6498078	That's pretty bad.
6498158	6501361	They'd have Pit there and he'd be like, Hi, I'm Kid Icarus, but I'm not Pit.
6502422	6504723	John Fields wanted us to plug CaptainN.net.
6505884	6506205	Enjoy.
6507205	6508386	Dude, I'm going to go to that site.
6508767	6510988	Okay, I think that we should do the cage match now.
6512489	6513630	Match game or something, God.
6513650	6515852	You know what other show I remember though from the 80s?
6516593	6517113	Kid Video.
6518074	6519535	Freaking Kid Video was the best.
6520310	6520710	You know what?
6520730	6524192	I haven't understood one topic that we've discussed.
6524472	6525593	Because you a baby.
6525913	6526933	The whole night.
6527754	6531595	Jay Kinetic actually says here, he says, he married Kid Video.
6531736	6532576	That's what happened to Captain Eddie.
6532616	6533436	He married Kid Video.
6533456	6535317	They live in the Castro now and run a small bookstore.
6537738	6539319	Kid Video was the name of the band.
6541600	6542841	Maybe he married the whole band.
6542881	6543201	I don't know.
6546803	6548384	See, I remember the intro to that song.
6548624	6548945	Yeah, I agree.
6548965	6549545	Let's skip to the cage match.
6549565	6552967	And they would play, like, you know, horrible 80s videos afterwards.
6555729	6557330	Remember, do not play track one or two.
6557631	6558411	Do not play track two.
6559032	6560052	It will blow out your speakers.
6562454	6564095	One of the tracks will show up as the game.
6564115	6567357	Well, no, it was... Back to the day, yeah.
6572557	6581380	You want to know what's really cool is if you put in the Japanese version of the Dracula X2 and then put in Castlevania the Knight, he actually says exactly the same thing, just one's in English and the other.
6581520	6584721	They did a perfect translation on that.
6584761	6585862	There is no track 14.
6586662	6587502	Is it the last track?
6587522	6588682	It's the last track.
6588702	6589263	So is it track 13?
6591061	6592442	Whatever, okay.
6592582	6594943	It shows up as track 14 on mine.
6595523	6598344	If it ain't it, then I'll just get bitch slapped.
6598804	6602826	That's right, track 13 plus a dated track, so track 14.
6603246	6604426	Okay, we got that settled now.
6604586	6604766	Good.
6605547	6607668	Then, let's get it on.
6608508	6609928	The cage match, everybody.
6610869	6611309	Hooray.
6611889	6612149	Rob?
6615611	6616011	I don't know.
6617466	6617886	No, I'm too lazy.
6617906	6619087	But I've been to this one before.
6619107	6619647	Where's your house?
6619667	6620568	Tell people on Twitter.
6644207	6646608	Okay, so anyway, we'll talk about where Jamie lives.
6646648	6648268	Yes, but next week the show's going to be displaced.
6648308	6650109	We'll be at the house of Jamie.
6651829	6655631	But it'll be all the same fun and crazy pornography antics that you're used to.
6656371	6657111	And we'll have Shermie.
6658291	6658531	Word.
6658892	6660312	Okay, so anyway, back to the cage match.
6663975	6685220	Alright, last week on the cage match, in a very much surprise win, I was very surprised at this, but Chatroom has some weird tastes sometimes, but no, this is actually a pretty good song, this is a good one to win, but man, against, come on, Legend of Trance, I thought for sure that would win, and then we had the Love of the Angel, I thought the dedication would have votes built into it, but apparently...
6686434	6687935	Did Charum have other ideas in mind?
6687975	6688776	Because this is the winner.
6688816	6690877	This is Wild Side with Heaven is a Place on Earth.
6690917	6693479	This is the first song you can vote for in tonight's cage match.
6693819	6694659	The reigning champion.
6694699	6695220	Here's a clip.
6748044	6751507	All right, that's the first song you can vote for is Wild Side with Heaven is a Place on Earth.
6752027	6757431	The way the cage match works, by the way, for those of you who are kind of new to our chat room and the show, we're going to play three songs.
6757771	6759833	First off, we play a clip of last week's winner.
6759853	6763336	Then we'll play two full-length songs, two new songs that are chosen by the hosts.
6764036	6765717	And you guys vote on your favorite.
6765757	6766358	And the winner...
6766978	6776383	goes into rotation on Orange Lounge Radio's music show that plays all week long when we're not here with all your favorite DDR, 2DX, Tasmania music and the Cage Match winner.
6776903	6781126	So, that being said, you can't submit your votes until the end of the third song, though.
6781506	6785128	So don't send them yet because we've got two more to go, including Loki's Choice.
6785208	6786409	Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?
6787449	6791934	Tonight we have one of my most favorite Grant songs.
6792895	6798641	This is Sasha with his very, I think, pretty famous Expander.
6799662	6801824	Alright, and let me know if this is the wrong one on X-Things.
6801844	6803066	We're kind of trying to pull this from CD.
6803086	6804427	This might be the wrong track, but here we go.
6804787	6807671	This is Sasha with Expander, Loki's pick.
7054759	7059562	Alright, that was Sasha with Expander, that was Loki's pick for tonight's cage match.
7059762	7061323	Let's go around the room and get our thoughts on it.
7061423	7061683	Jamie?
7062183	7063464	Competitive, but nice.
7064125	7066066	I give it a 7.5.
7066466	7066066	7.5.
7067206	7067587	Johnny?
7070889	7072590	You're eating, alright, we'll come back to you, Johnny.
7073090	7074231	Alright, Loki?
7074651	7076352	I still like it, so I'm giving it a 9.
7078713	7081315	I thought it was actually pretty decent, so I give it like 8.5.
7083021	7083381	Dave?
7085022	7086063	I give it an 8.
7087484	7088084	Any reason why?
7088104	7094288	I wasn't really listening, and I can't say it was bad or good, but I trust Loki's judgment.
7094868	7098010	I say, I agree with Jamie, it was a little bit repetitive, I give it a 7.
7098991	7099271	Johnny?
7100111	7103513	I'll go around the majority and pick the average, I'm going to say 7.
7104134	7104454	Alright.
7105154	7105935	Yeah, it was...
7108613	7110775	Okay, so that's two down, one more to go.
7111555	7113757	This is the last pick for tonight's cage match.
7113797	7115338	This is a song I downloaded.
7115418	7123083	Actually, Billy, the guy that was here earlier, Billy the Big Homo, who told us the Mardi Gras story, suggested I download this song, and it ain't too bad, and I could totally see it in DDR.
7123564	7125045	So I thought you guys might enjoy it.
7126826	7129848	And this is... No, I should put Kylie Minogue in, though, huh?
7130188	7130588	You know what?
7130689	7131149	Fuck that.
7131529	7132190	Fuck this pick.
7132950	7133910	I've changed my mind.
7134030	7136111	I have done a last minute change my mind pick.
7136792	7138552	I want Kylie in the cage match.
7138912	7139773	I know a song I want to hear.
7139793	7142734	So, my pick for tonight's cage match.
7142754	7143614	God, I hope I can find it.
7143654	7145915	Hold on, I gotta... No, no, no.
7146496	7146996	It's a different one.
7147256	7148536	It's really fucked up.
7148696	7150697	But I'm kind of going really random.
7153178	7154619	Okay, this is my pick.
7154839	7156920	Oh, I downloaded something for Billy and I forgot to bring it.
7157600	7159901	I got the lingerie commercial to download.
7160581	7162322	I downloaded it for Billy and I didn't give it to him.
7163416	7168318	You know, okay, I'm being told that I don't get it, that that track is one of the mainstays of Trance and all that.
7168338	7169178	It's been around for eight years.
7169658	7170038	So what?
7170078	7170898	It's still repetitive.
7170918	7171639	That's my opinion.
7171679	7172659	Eight years is old.
7172979	7173779	Eight years is old.
7174500	7174840	All right.
7175860	7176760	Okay, I changed my mind.
7176800	7179461	This is my pick instead, because I want to get really random.
7179481	7181002	The other one was too mainstream.
7181022	7189264	This is Kylie Minogue with a song that Robbie Williams helped her co-write, and it's really messed up, and the video's cool, and it looks like Xanadu.
7189284	7189785	It really does.
7189805	7190405	Billy told me.
7190445	7191085	I'm going to download this one.
7191466	7195383	This is called Your Disco Needs You, and this is my pick for tonight's cage match.
7195423	7195664	Enjoy.
7236010	7239293	Thank you for watching
7278621	7294588	You're sold on vanity, but that's so see-through Take your body to the floor, your disco needs you From soul to soul, your disco needs you
7318168	7319210	Thanks for watching!
7469878	7474680	Alright, Kylie Minogue with Your Disco Needs You, going around the room starting with Jamie.
7475320	7478682	Rob, I'm going to paraphrase Happy Bunny when I say this.
7479702	7481003	That song just made me throw up a little.
7481283	7484264	It gets like a four.
7484284	7488386	I thought it was pretty tight.
7489026	7490046	Yeah!
7490467	7492167	Johnny knows good music when he hears it.
7492467	7495989	I'm going to go ahead and give that an eight and a half.
7496249	7496749	Oh yeah.
7496769	7498090	That was pretty tight.
7499969	7503333	Okay, I like Robin Williams and Kylie Minogue.
7503413	7504654	Robbie Williams, there's a difference.
7505935	7506516	Whatever.
7507177	7507577	Okay.
7507597	7512762	Okay, I loved it when he sang Millennium.
7513443	7515325	And, you know, Kylie Minogue is pretty cool.
7516046	7518008	Even though I don't like her for any of her music.
7518655	7527780	But that movie, um, or, yeah, I'd like to think of it as a movie because most of the movies I've seen suck, and that song, too, did suck.
7528381	7529361	It sucked pretty bad.
7529481	7534705	In fact, yeah, it sucked as badly as Dave was sucking on that bottle.
7535605	7537686	And that was pretty bad.
7539227	7540968	Not as hard as Candace Cameron, though.
7540988	7544090	Ooh, that's a toughie.
7546528	7549130	No, she's a slut, so that's different.
7549150	7553512	Yeah, but I give it a 2 out of... I give it a nice 2 out of 10.
7553972	7554212	What?
7554913	7555893	Aw, you don't know good music.
7556274	7556834	Moving on.
7557174	7559695	Yeah, well, that's all I'm hearing, and yeah.
7559715	7564898	I saw that Candace Cameron chick on that I Love the 80s thing on VH1.
7565819	7572383	That was so... The last thing I remember her in was that stupid movie where she got... Hi, hi, hi, page match, Kylie, disco.
7574955	7577998	I lost interest in that song in, like, the first ten seconds.
7579299	7583482	If I could give it negatives, I would, but I'll just say, like, one.
7587225	7589627	We were holding a whole conversation during that song.
7590808	7594691	Uh, we were talking, we started off talking about, like, the Dreamcast stuff.
7594931	7596973	Yeah, we were talking about Dreamcast and Vibribin.
7597580	7598941	That's how bad that song was.
7599041	7599402	I give it a 1.
7599662	7602184	Oh, whatever, whatever.
7602244	7604206	I give it a 10.
7604666	7609450	I'm going to retract mine and give it a half a point.
7609911	7611172	I give it a 30 then.
7614074	7615055	All right, all right.
7615075	7616016	He gives it a 100.
7616056	7616396	You know what?
7617397	7619699	I'm going to give you the wave first.
7620700	7627365	Okay, that song, you guys, just, you don't understand quirky music.
7627405	7629106	You guys just don't understand quirky music.
7629126	7629707	That's what it is.
7629727	7631388	I understand it.
7631408	7631808	Rob.
7632328	7633990	Ole, ole, ole.
7634590	7639073	Rob, I understand quirky music, and that wasn't quirky, that was vomiting.
7640594	7642756	I give it a 10, because Kylie Minogue owns all of you.
7642936	7643276	Yeah.
7643356	7644417	Alright, so let's review.
7644437	7644797	Okay.
7645278	7646819	Here's what you can vote for tonight.
7646879	7649521	You can vote for last week's winner, Wild Side, Heaven is a Place on Earth.
7656195	7658418	Or you can vote for Sasha with Expander.
7664687	7667070	Or you can vote for Kylie Minogue with your Disco Need You.
7674048	7679252	Alright, send your votes in now for the Orange Lounge cage match.
7679792	7682174	Send those votes over private message to Sky.
7683215	7686817	And we shall tally those votes up and have them for you in a few more minutes.
7688278	7693362	So, alright, we got a good chunk of time left in the show.
7695683	7696964	What are you talking about here?
7698105	7698425	Oh, okay.
7698886	7699026	Alright.
7713980	7719922	I should check the email box, see if we have any new messages here.
7719942	7721843	We have dead air here.
7723824	7725224	The cheat is grounded.
7726252	7729834	We had the light switch installed so you could turn the lights on and off.
7730114	7731294	Not so you could throw light switch waves.
7732675	7734176	I love that.
7735616	7740938	You know, we actually did have like this big Homestar Runner Fest over the weekend while Mel and Melody were over at my house.
7740998	7745160	Yeah, like, I sat down on that site for like 45 minutes just going over the stuff.
7745180	7747321	My favorite one was the way- I'M FREAKING CARMEN MIRANDA!
7749042	7763669	My favorite one was where the person's, where it was to the guy with the long name, to the song, and he said, for how long it took me to say your name, I could have painted a picture, and he goes out in the backyard and starts painting a picture, and he's all, this looks good, like put it in the art gallery or paint it for some guy's dad.
7764429	7768971	I don't know that, from what I've heard, a lot of people haven't caught this particular section of HomestarRunner.com.
7768991	7769311	Which one?
7769771	7771232	The Marzipan's answering machine.
7771272	7771692	Yeah, I did.
7772292	7773853	But I haven't talked to a lot of people who have.
7774073	7776234	I went, like, there's a third thing I did.
7776734	7777575	This call is...
7778275	7781079	This call is not your boyfriend.
7781179	7784143	That was the coolest thing ever.
7784623	7785885	I actually sent an email.
7786165	7788809	You have been diagnosed with serious problems.
7789850	7791352	I sent Strong Bad an email.
7791472	7793174	Leave your stereo on the front porch.
7793895	7797176	Yeah, come back later or something.
7797336	7798636	Yeah, I sent an email to StrongBad.
7798797	7803378	It was one that was saying, if someone made an RPG about you, what would your character be?
7803898	7805919	It would just be interesting to see what he says to that one.
7806099	7806799	You know what, though?
7806959	7808900	That actually brings up a point.
7809120	7812661	If you were suddenly listed to the world of Dungeons & Dragons, what would your character class be?
7813761	7820503	My character would be, like, some retarded... I would be some, like, retarded wizard, like Orc from He-Man.
7820843	7822464	No, would you be, like, a wild mage then?
7823124	7823284	Yeah.
7824170	7825031	Wild Mages are cool.
7825951	7826651	What about you?
7826731	7827752	What would your character class be?
7828652	7830393	I was an evil jester last time I played.
7830974	7831614	An evil jester?
7831794	7834676	An evil jester who had playing cards that turned people into stuff.
7835136	7835936	Like jackasses.
7836437	7836897	That's cool.
7837437	7841279	Yeah, if you were suddenly whisked to the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons, what would your character class be?
7841479	7841839	You know what?
7841859	7844421	I never played it, so... Lesbian.
7845754	7847415	A lesbian is not a character class.
7848176	7850238	Although I played a lesbian ninja once.
7850258	7853761	The one time I played D&D, I was a lesbian.
7854081	7854321	So.
7855982	7856243	No, wait.
7856643	7858684	I want to play a lesbian ninja.
7859165	7859665	Oh, wait, wait.
7859925	7860446	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
7860746	7861787	I was a beautiful lesbian.
7861807	7865410	Isn't D&D like the game where you just kind of make up shit and be like, hey, what's up?
7865430	7867291	To be honest with you, I never got into D&D either.
7868412	7871155	Like, hey, yeah, I'm cool.
7872347	7875469	It's like, yeah, I'm Tigger, I can play any song.
7875489	7877251	Just describe what your person would do.
7878772	7881273	My person, he wouldn't do much.
7881394	7883535	Like, do they have, like, magicians or whatever?
7883555	7885116	There's wizards, clerics.
7886257	7887478	Like, a major wizard.
7887518	7888098	This is good.
7888439	7888899	This is good.
7889159	7890380	Loki's got a good idea here.
7890680	7892361	Or was it Zero that had the idea in turn?
7892401	7892682	I don't know.
7892722	7894463	Like, yes, back in there, they were kind of thinking this.
7894863	7897385	We should do this live on air as a segment, for instance, because we're desperate.
7897405	7899927	We're coming up for new segments, because, you know, we can only... There's only...
7900587	7904211	After some time, we're going to have done every listless topic we could possibly do.
7904811	7910717	So, thinking of starting a D&D DDR game, and we can play it live on air.
7911998	7912879	DDR D&D.
7913580	7914140	You know what?
7915041	7916323	Actually, no, I'll tell you what.
7917043	7924851	Let me sit down with freaking White Wolf Fools and I can make up the Pokemon style, you know, like in the game, DDR RPG.
7925777	7926837	Okay, you're on.
7927597	7928578	And we'll play it live on air.
7928638	7930138	I'll put this and I'm not going to run it.
7932799	7933699	Yeah, roll the dice.
7934059	7934579	Roll the dice.
7934679	7935959	Bam, I just got six greats.
7935979	7936839	Yeah, I can just see it now.
7936899	7941460	You like roll a dice and one says, I got 14 perfects and six greats.
7944221	7948182	Actually, I would just, I think it would be cool for all of us to meet like one night a week.
7949331	7953635	Put the microphones on over us really loud and, like, game on the computer.
7954156	7956418	Sit in here, do tabletop gaming while everyone has to listen to us.
7956438	7959481	No, just bring in Mario Party and listen to us play that live on air.
7959501	7960221	That would be great.
7960521	7961462	Should have heard me earlier today.
7961502	7962303	I choked Irene.
7965606	7966427	She was being mean to me.
7968467	7978314	We need to seriously get enough bandwidth to do a video feed because then what you can do is you can do a picture of what's on the TV as the video feed and hear us talking over it.
7978594	7979795	Like, you son of a bitch!
7979855	7980696	That was my story!
7980716	7981476	You know, stuff like that.
7981977	7983378	That'd be great, but we can't.
7983398	7984318	You know what, though?
7984518	7988922	I used to sit and play D&D with my friends and I would always wear my black cloak over my head.
7989782	7997348	So you'd see this, like, see me huddled over with a black cloak over me, and all of a sudden this hand would creep out, throwing dice, and then go back, write something down.
7997368	7999029	That would be fun to have a Super Smash Bros.
7999049	8002071	like, tournament, and have people watch us go on about that.
8002171	8003832	I would win all, I would win all of it.
8004172	8004793	Two characters.
8006034	8008195	Adult Link, Adult Link, and Sheik.
8010457	8010777	Melee.
8010957	8011337	Melee.
8013319	8013919	I would be Ness.
8014059	8014339	Ness.
8014440	8014580	Yep.
8014640	8014820	Yep.
8016843	8018545	Come near me and I will smack you with a bat.
8019806	8021187	Actually, I have another character.
8021207	8022969	I'm actually really good with a bunch of characters on that one.
8022989	8027052	My other good one, who was my best one from the N64 one, was Kirby.
8027753	8028754	Kirby will never die.
8029034	8032938	You know what we should do is have a home run derby contest and see who can hit the furthest.
8033418	8034099	No.
8034139	8036041	Home run derby on rival schools.
8037021	8038082	You know, I can't play that game.
8038283	8039504	I can't read a damn thing.
8041187	8041447	Okay.
8042448	8045491	We actually, you know what, on another show, play DDR Live on NetCam.
8045511	8046192	It's actually funny.
8046212	8052737	The show that kind of preceded this, I guess some would consider Orange Lounge a spin-off of Under Sedation Live.org.
8052877	8053958	Which still plays Saturday nights.
8053978	8057061	Which still does play on Saturday nights, 630 to 930 Pacific Standard Time.
8057261	8058462	Under Sedation Live.org.
8058783	8062786	We actually did do a DDR show, which was kind of where this all came from.
8062866	8065268	Orange Lounge actually kind of was birthed by that show.
8065368	8066950	I was a guest more times than anybody.
8068337	8070658	and we did play DDR Live on air and we had the cam and everything.
8070678	8071819	It was pretty crazy.
8073040	8073960	Who was around for that?
8074020	8076742	I don't know if anybody who's listening to Orange Lounge was around for that show.
8077022	8077342	Who knows?
8078683	8081684	That was Orange Lounge in the fetal stage.
8081784	8083185	Black Lab, save your question.
8083205	8087067	We're going to do Ask Orange Lounge when we come back from the break because we have some new people listening tonight.
8089108	8089869	You want some more points?
8089889	8092571	Well, let's take a quick break, because I want to get the cage match finished up.
8092631	8094513	So I'm going to give people a chance to send in the last votes.
8094753	8100058	We're just going to do a one-song break, because this is a five-minute song, but JB's been begging and begging me to play this, so fine.
8101079	8103581	This is the sign with words, a dance mix.
8103641	8104782	So I don't know what it's like.
8104862	8106043	We'll hear it live on air.
8106464	8107925	If it sucks, blame JB.
8107985	8109266	Oh, yeah, we've got to get to the absolute.
8109326	8111188	Well, we'll do absolute before the end of the show, I promise.
8111669	8113290	The absolute guitar mix, we'll do that.
8116152	8118473	So this is the last chance to get in your votes for the cage match.
8118493	8122835	If you haven't voted, you have 60 more seconds and then voting is closed or you die.
8124196	8126017	So, we will be back.
8126057	8126417	Enjoy.
8129719	8141304	Don't come easy to me How can I find a way to make you see I love you words don't come easy
8144520	8145341	White White White
8325714	8339282	Don't come easy to me How can I find a way To make you see Our lovey words Don't come easy Come on, touch me
8420024	8422906	Alright, some kind of mixed reaction from the chatroom on that one.
8422926	8425448	The sign with words sent to us by JB by request.
8425828	8428610	Okay, this is going to be the part now.
8428650	8430751	We're tallying up your votes for the cage match.
8430771	8438736	However, when we come back, we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge or Ask Johnny, Ask the Intern, Zero, or Ask Dave.
8438976	8439757	Our delinquent.
8440990	8442372	Bombay, you can ask Bombay.
8442553	8445237	And Bombay, what kind of questions would you want to answer?
8445297	8449924	Like things about freestyle, things about... Yeah, freestyle, because I'm trying to get in more to freestyle.
8450304	8452247	I'm trying to compete more, get more experience and all that.
8452508	8454050	And then you guys know Dave and the intern by now.
8454070	8454511	This is giant.
8454969	8458090	Yo, yo, I go to McDonald's, not Delta Co.
8458390	8459910	Yo, yo.
8460350	8464991	Anyway, okay, so send us your questions over a private message to Sky, and we'll get to those.
8465211	8471052	Or, if you're too lazy to be in the chat room, just send them over email, orangeloungeradio, all one word, at yahoo.com.
8472012	8475933	And you can also always send us your comments or whatever else.
8475993	8478673	So, something Bomani-related for you guys that I promised earlier.
8478713	8481394	Here you go, and we'll be back after this with Ask Orange Lounge.
8481434	8482254	Send your questions now.
8737893	8743737	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
8749482	8750243	We are back.
8750663	8751524	Hope you enjoyed that.
8751564	8756068	That absolute version, by the way, it's labeled as Taka featuring Good Cool.
8758681	8765606	Rumor is that it might be a fake, however, somebody swore up and down to me they had a video of somebody playing that from Poppin' Music 9.
8765806	8769668	Okay, if that's a fake, that's one hell of a good fake.
8769849	8775973	Yeah, I was going to say, I believe Tal said in the chat room, if it's a fake, it's a damn good fake, and I want more by that faker.
8776773	8790058	Seriously, I seriously doubt that that's a fake because, I mean, hold on, it's absolute in guitar, and it doesn't sound like shit, and unlike M, you know, which obviously could have been made by anybody, but this is a lot better.
8790638	8791658	I don't see how this is a fake.
8793179	8794439	Okay, well, there you have it.
8794840	8796040	Like it or not, fake or not.
8796687	8801271	It could be quite possible that it's one of those special editions like the .59.
8802652	8805114	That's very true, like the .59 live mix and stuff?
8805134	8808217	Well, not the live one, but the really gothy sounding one.
8808597	8814042	I have a DWI I'm making to like the second remix or whatever of .59.
8814262	8820107	It's like half done, and it actually has a backbeat to it instead of like how .59 originally was.
8820567	8823029	The original one had a beat to it.
8823310	8825311	Well, I can't explain it.
8825571	8827833	It seems more, it's a lot more fulfilling.
8827853	8832077	You hear it better the more that you play it in 2DX.
8832157	8840985	The thing about that remix that you're doing that, it's like the piano, it makes sense at first, but then it just goes into a different song after that.
8843906	8845229	So do you guys want to know who won the cage match?
8845930	8846251	Alright.
8846411	8851600	The cage match winner was... And I was surprised because Kylie did manage to get at least one vote.
8854064	8855327	So not everybody sucks.
8855968	8856248	Alright.
8860250	8865312	But the winner was Sasha by quite a little bit of a landslide, ladies and gentlemen.
8865892	8869694	So, Sasha takes it and is the winner of the Cage Match.
8869714	8871935	I'm going to have to think of something next week.
8872615	8876956	That means what I was talking about in here is going to get played next week.
8879117	8879417	Alright.
8881358	8885960	Well, you know, at least Loki can't bring in one of his remixes and win it for sure because, you know, it's Loki.
8886773	8887494	No, never mind.
8887934	8888354	Never mind.
8888955	8889715	I won't bring it next week.
8889735	8890896	I'll bring something really good next week.
8890916	8894138	Yeah, I'm going to fuck it up next week, too, and bring something really psycho.
8894559	8894759	What?
8896640	8898361	Oh, we'll talk later.
8898401	8899562	We'll come up with a plan.
8900023	8902905	You know, I'm thinking I'll get that chick from American Idol.
8902925	8905166	That'll be my cage mat fix.
8905427	8907928	The children of the world.
8907948	8910710	The children, what about the children?
8910750	8912251	I have my Ayudo remixes.
8913052	8913933	My Ayudo CDs.
8915134	8915554	Uh-huh.
8917496	8919377	The chick from Sacramento on American Idol is a bitch.
8919577	8922379	Anyway, not that I know her or anything, she's just a bitch on the show.
8923259	8925801	Alright, okay, we're gonna do Ask Orange Lounge now, you guys ready?
8927927	8931229	Oh, come on.
8934071	8934311	Okay.
8934731	8935291	Ask Orange Lounge.
8935311	8935631	Here we go.
8936372	8940574	For those that don't know Ask Orange Lounge, this is your opportunity to ask us anything you've ever wanted to ask.
8940974	8946077	If you're sick that we don't talk about Bomani enough on this show, ask us Bomani-related questions.
8946097	8946898	We'd be happy to answer.
8947378	8949259	You want to know something about Loki's sex life?
8949879	8950220	Ask it.
8950300	8951060	Maybe he'll answer it.
8951120	8953622	Or maybe he'll come up with a vicious lie.
8953662	8954022	Who knows?
8955530	8958851	Ask it and we'll answer it.
8960711	8962012	Alright, here we go.
8963192	8967713	Black Lab has the first question because I made him hold it over until this segment because this was kind of the inspiration.
8967873	8969013	We always do Ask Orange Lounge tonight.
8969293	8970154	It's a question for Jamie.
8971214	8974074	Black Lab would like to know, whatever happened to the Orange Lounge quiz?
8975055	8976635	We're going to do a live journal quiz.
8976655	8979896	You know how live journal quizzes all the... Okay, this is what happened.
8979916	8980896	Jamie got a job.
8982797	8983157	Okay?
8983557	8984137	End of story.
8985305	8986306	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9007143	9012645	So come to the chatroom, come to the chatroom Tuesday night, and we'll let you know what block and zone we're playing in.
9012685	9013686	This is PSO GameCube.
9013706	9018028	First of all, remember that Jamie played her game all at once, and she actually needs to get past level 1.
9018108	9020729	Well, I think what we're going to do, this is the other stipulation.
9020769	9022670	Tuesday night, if you come, new character.
9022790	9025011	We're all going to start with new characters for Tuesday night.
9025131	9029433	Mine, even though I made her when I first got the game, I've only played it once, so I'll leave her as she is.
9029653	9030253	Okay, that's fine.
9030753	9033434	But it's got to be low level, so we all start at the same and progress at the same.
9033534	9034595	Nothing higher than level 1.
9035215	9037996	If you're into PSO, GameCube, come on the chatroom Tuesday night.
9038016	9038876	We'll let you know where we're at.
9038957	9039197	Okay.
9039877	9041778	What are you guys talking about back here?
9042278	9043618	I've never played PSO.
9043658	9044358	I don't know what that is.
9044418	9044879	Sucks to be you.
9044899	9046259	Fantasy Star Online.
9048320	9050061	Get a GameCube and a broadband adapter.
9050081	9051061	I'll show it to you sometime.
9051441	9051721	Alright.
9052821	9053982	I think I might play my game tonight.
9054562	9054982	Here we go.
9055082	9056703	How about our stipulation be no one over level 3?
9057463	9058984	Okay, that's fine.
9059244	9059844	Alright, moving on.
9061084	9062185	Jay Kinetic wants to know...
9063163	9064884	Can I kill the intern on a show?
9067665	9068285	Can I kill you?
9070507	9071527	No, you don't want to fight with Jahi.
9072487	9073468	Jahi, kick your ass.
9074769	9075089	Alright.
9075529	9077570	Who's everyone's favorite superhero?
9079111	9082912	Juman!
9082972	9083873	Dave says Juman.
9085113	9085434	Bombay.
9085834	9089195	I'm gonna have to go with Dave and say Juman.
9089596	9090916	Juman for Bombay, too.
9091877	9092177	Loki.
9093402	9098046	I'm not fucking seeing Juman, ass!
9100628	9105672	Dude, one of my friends is like... Fine, if you're going to say Juman, I'm going to say Nazi boy.
9107834	9108995	It's my arch rival!
9109395	9110056	Loki!
9110476	9111096	Jesus!
9112798	9115439	We are going to have to tape his mouth shut.
9115679	9123564	He's like Nazi Boy, the protector of the... Loki is worse than t-shirthell.com tonight.
9123945	9126186	It's all about fucking Bluntman.
9126306	9128547	Alright, Bluntman, much better.
9129348	9130829	Much better, Bluntman, thank you.
9131987	9136331	I got to apologize for my killing you comment, but I would say Orgasmo.
9136991	9137872	Orgasmo!
9138472	9138933	Excellent.
9139413	9140334	You want me to go or you want to go?
9140374	9140754	My turn.
9140914	9141454	Alright, Jamie.
9142455	9143876	Handyman and the Tiny Avenger.
9144317	9146118	Handyman and the Tiny Avenger.
9147499	9148500	You want to talk about Ju-Man for a second?
9149062	9154164	Dude, one of my friends, like, cause a couple people at school, like, joke about me being Jewish whenever I say something.
9154664	9158146	Like, I would make a comment and they're like, oh, is that a Jewish type thing?
9158606	9160887	And so he's got, he's one of my friends who can draw.
9161227	9173693	He's making this comic called Jew Man about, like, me and, like, I get too close to, like, some bush that lights on fire and something and I gain, like, magical Jew powers with my mega menorah and my dreidel of power and stuff.
9174133	9175514	Totally sounds like Paul.
9175654	9177795	Do you have like super spitting power?
9178075	9179415	Do you have spitting action?
9179775	9180336	I don't know.
9181236	9182116	Paul is dead.
9182697	9183297	He's gone.
9183337	9184958	That's Orange Lounge Ask the World.
9185118	9187659	Your action figure needs kosher scent power.
9189019	9190580	I love you too.
9190640	9194702	I'm changing my vote from Jew Man, I'm changing it, to Lightning Day.
9196642	9197023	Alright.
9197563	9200224	Anyone that knows me, this should be a duh.
9200264	9202425	My favorite superhero is Catwoman, of course.
9205788	9206429	She's a hero to some.
9206449	9206889	She's good now.
9206909	9207749	She's a hero to me.
9208470	9210050	She's a hero to me and she's going to have her own movie.
9210891	9213672	Are the interns... More questions from Jahi.
9213792	9214592	More questions from Jahi.
9214932	9216333	Are the interns related to Godden?
9217314	9217554	No.
9218894	9219875	He's a guy in SoCal.
9219955	9220575	Who is that?
9222796	9223556	One of the big... Okay, well...
9226739	9231480	Mel told me I should MC a tournament with him, but I'm not related to him.
9232360	9232880	He seemed cool.
9232920	9237541	I didn't really talk to him at all, because I was kind of introverted and clicky at CyberBeat, unfortunately, because I'm a bitch.
9237641	9240902	I'm not really an intern, by the way.
9241042	9243783	I'm just kind of sitting in, I guess.
9244603	9245103	You're a guest.
9245403	9246563	Monica Lewinsky was an intern.
9246583	9247824	That means we make him go do stuff.
9251747	9252087	All right.
9253107	9253728	Next question.
9254408	9256028	Is Orange Lounge for the children?
9257889	9262490	I don't know, but I think... Children of the liking to listen to crazy monkey sex?
9262650	9263730	Nope.
9263790	9264850	JB will agree with me.
9265050	9268691	You know, we actually are the founders of the Cup of Child Foundation.
9269331	9271452	You know, new flavors of ramen, Cup of Child.
9271472	9273973	Answer that question.
9273993	9276013	There's skanky RVGL flavor.
9276973	9279274	There's, you know, spicy Scandia flavor.
9280086	9283489	Then there's, you know, there's CCL ass flavor.
9283509	9284189	No, no, no, remember that?
9284209	9286531	No, that's drugs and alcohol flavor.
9286611	9289594	And then Crud Under the Machine, uh, Crest-V flavor.
9295599	9297620	Um, Orange Lounge is non-existent flavor.
9298061	9300943	Orange Lounge is not for the children, but they listen to it anyway.
9301964	9303685	We think... It's like porn.
9304746	9305767	We think that children are lazy.
9305787	9306828	I could say anything to porn.
9309198	9316463	I love how everyone thinks I'm like a racist, porn-addicted, crazy psychopath, when I'm like totally opposite in person.
9316723	9317003	Alright.
9317463	9317984	Next question.
9318224	9318464	Okay.
9318964	9320125	Next question is for Loki.
9320525	9321486	Next question is for Loki.
9321706	9324408	And frosted with sugar and fortified with vitamins.
9324668	9325648	Next question is for Loki.
9325668	9326069	Here we go.
9326549	9327910	Does Loki have a sex life?
9328550	9329390	Damn right I do!
9330511	9339976	Oh man, dude, seriously, you think I sound horny on air, imagine my girlfriend, she's about ten times as horny as I am, so, it's just like, holy crap.
9343117	9346039	It's a good, it's a, it's damn good.
9347580	9349001	For your birthday, we'll get you vitamins.
9349402	9351403	Okay.
9351523	9355006	Seriously, I do need vitamins because I don't eat well at all.
9355126	9358169	I eat like one meal a day and it's normally junk food and I'm tired.
9360471	9361712	Okay, but that's alright.
9362052	9366295	SkylineDC505, Dave, do I still get prawn for my birthday?
9367416	9370299	Well, that depends on if I get my prawn from Loki.
9370359	9370579	Okay.
9372782	9373383	I got two mics.
9375486	9378611	Anyways, I can get you both prawns, so that's no problem.
9380313	9381375	Where's my man prawn?
9381635	9381936	Cool.
9381976	9382416	I'm trying!
9382436	9383338	He's not coming!
9384079	9384860	Johnny wants prawns.
9384900	9386603	The men aren't coming in the prawn?
9388476	9388897	Moving on.
9389377	9392780	EOSFVB, he always has some good questions for us, so here they are.
9393260	9402689	First question, who has read, and now I have to do my horrible English again, who has read Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes?
9403870	9404511	No, I haven't.
9405451	9406052	I haven't either.
9406392	9407693	But I'm interested in reading it.
9408154	9408895	I bet it's porn.
9409155	9409655	No, it's not.
9410076	9411337	It's EOSFVB, come on.
9412017	9413739	Second question is for Dave.
9413999	9414800	Second question is for Dave.
9416837	9417878	You want to ask it, Jamie?
9417998	9418638	I'm leaning back.
9418678	9419579	I ain't reading it from here.
9419739	9420199	Shit.
9420959	9422080	Segway's for Dave.
9422420	9425602	Did you ever beat that ancient boy game, amateur?
9426783	9427944	No, I never actually beat it.
9428004	9429805	I never played it after that one day.
9430205	9433207	I just played it and I got to one bone left with two cracks in it.
9434127	9435288	A bone and some crack.
9435448	9436348	I think it was a bone.
9437709	9439550	I think that's what... No, no, you were throwing a bone.
9439570	9441932	First you take crack, then you take bone.
9442032	9443793	Insert bone into crack.
9444784	9449525	Repeat as often as necessary until you obtain desired results.
9450686	9451546	The end.
9451686	9454867	Next question, and it's Bomani-related, and it's an excellent question.
9455467	9460628	Satome Ranma wants to know, I ask Orange Lounge this, why is it so hard to find Poppin' Music mp3s?
9460688	9464709	Seriously, Not A House, Pyramid, MeloBunk, or TraumaBunk anywhere, dammit.
9465430	9466890	Poppin' Music mp3s, hard to find.
9467355	9473458	First of all, Poppin' Music is really cool, but it does have a limited fanbase, honestly.
9473658	9474659	You want Poppin' Music MP3s?
9474679	9475880	Go to Bomayi Style.
9476660	9477020	Serious.
9477440	9479121	Tons of MP3s for Poppin' Music stuff there.
9479542	9482083	Or, if you can't find them, look for Feeling Pomu.
9482623	9483384	That's their sim.
9484104	9487226	And I'm sure if you find sim files for that, you'll probably find the MP3s as well.
9488847	9492268	Actually, you know how much of a pain in the ass it is to find sim files for that?
9492609	9492989	I have it.
9493049	9494049	I found all but two.
9494730	9495010	Anywhere.
9495290	9496831	That's why you use the Japanese internet.
9497245	9509534	I was going to actually suggest, if you're looking for Poppin' Music MP3s, go download SimFiles, because people make SimFiles to all these other Bomani Game MP3s, and Poppin' Music happens to be made into files a lot.
9510134	9511195	Also, there's WinMex.
9512116	9512516	Very good.
9514958	9520442	And eBay, they have three of the Poppin' Music soundtracks on eBay right now for about five bucks a piece.
9521747	9526969	Okay, Satomi Ranma also wants to know, as a follow-up question, have you guys seen the original Japanese The Ring?
9527109	9527669	Scary shit.
9528209	9528529	Ringu.
9528669	9530970	I've been wanting to because I want to see it before I see the U.S.
9531070	9531130	one.
9531150	9531510	Guess what?
9531730	9533290	It's actually coming out at the same time in the U.S.
9533450	9533550	one.
9534031	9535071	They're releasing it on DUD.
9535151	9535511	Ringu.
9536711	9537272	Ringu.
9538092	9538432	Ringu.
9538572	9540553	Yeah, so it's coming out at the same time in the U.S.
9540613	9541833	It's going to be subtitled, I believe.
9543543	9546226	Actually, Billy, we were just talking about this earlier today.
9546246	9547648	Billy's seen it and he says it's very good.
9547768	9549990	And I guess it's a three-part series there.
9551111	9552873	Actually, I have a question for our chat room.
9553173	9553534	What's that?
9554174	9557718	I don't remember hardly anything about this movie, but I've been trying to find it.
9558659	9561221	I've been putting in all these clues trying to find this one movie.
9561241	9563524	I wonder if anyone's ever heard of it or knows what this is.
9564004	9565766	It had to have come out in the early 80s or late 70s.
9567067	9572148	It was this movie about these people who move into this house that's possessed by three Japanese spirits.
9572909	9576010	And these people, back then, each killed themselves.
9576050	9580531	And then in the movie, the people end up recreating the fight that led to the three there who killed themselves.
9581051	9582191	And they kill themselves the same way.
9584352	9587313	This was an old movie, and I've been trying to find the name of this movie.
9588753	9589833	No, it's not a Brady Bunch movie.
9590193	9590533	Interesting.
9593812	9595776	And it's like these, you know, Uber.
9596077	9597760	And it's like these Uber cracker people, too.
9599503	9600886	And they're like almost in a beach house.
9601026	9603231	It's a house with these stairs leading up and it's by the water.
9604553	9604894	No, it's not.
9604914	9605575	We can't get rid of it.
9606224	9612528	But for anyone who happens to know the name of this movie or anything, please let me know, because I've been trying to find this for, like, years.
9612908	9616330	Alright, we still got a ton of questions to go through, so let's move right along here.
9616790	9622333	Alright, John Fields wants to know, favorite non-standard DDR mix, i.e.
9622573	9623494	Euro, Disney?
9624755	9625355	Ohasta!
9627313	9628393	Ohasta says Jamie.
9628493	9628854	Bombay?
9629614	9631034	I have to say Disney.
9631154	9635656	I went to go play in Orange County, and it's like the best mix I've ever played.
9636957	9637437	Euromix 2.
9639458	9643019	That's tough, but I'd probably say Ohasta, only because it has Ohaska on it.
9646865	9647625	Say your answer too.
9648866	9650686	Alright, you say your answer too.
9650867	9651907	I say pump it up.
9655268	9656569	That's not DDR.
9659130	9661611	It's Korean DDR, same damn thing.
9661731	9662631	No, it's different.
9663752	9664452	Next question.
9664732	9665653	Alright, next question.
9667033	9671277	SnubDisnoid says, First off, what's the easiest Oni?
9671778	9677123	I've gotten halfway into a few Onis and even got to Stoic on Road of Tack once, but I haven't passed anything.
9677663	9678264	Easiest Oni?
9679153	9683015	Since I'd barely ever play them, I would have to say Naoki Standard.
9683575	9690758	Wait, are you talking about Extreme, or... Because on Max 2, I'm sure that you passed some of them, like Soul 6 and shit.
9691878	9694659	Soul 6 is easy, Naoki Standard was easy for me on Devils.
9694679	9698501	Yeah, Naoki Standard, and the first one, whatever, yeah, Nearly 130.
9699361	9706424	But if you're talking about Extreme, which I think that you are, then, yeah, the Dance Mania and the new Naoki thing.
9708803	9710886	Doesn't that dance menu one have Rhythm of Police in it though?
9713168	9713589	Thought it did.
9718753	9721754	Pop4 is an easy one, but that's a non-stop, yeah.
9722355	9722615	Alright.
9723995	9729657	Your second question we'll have to answer offline because we banned that topic from discussion on this show.
9730138	9732999	So, we'll answer your question offline gladly for you, though.
9733379	9734679	So, we'll get to that later.
9735820	9736120	Alright.
9737080	9740922	JapanMan wants to know, Dave, how long is your shaft?
9742523	9743323	That was a few months ago.
9747529	9748490	Snip the tip, baby.
9748950	9753293	No, um, I don't, I'm not going to answer that.
9753573	9757996	Like, yeah, more than you can handle.
9761598	9761918	Never.
9763119	9765100	It's above average, and that's all I'm saying.
9765140	9765721	Ah, above average.
9766441	9766881	It is.
9768122	9770043	Are you, no, don't do that, please.
9770444	9772045	Are you comparable with Ron Jeremy?
9773185	9774526	Comparable with Ron Jeremy?
9774666	9775807	I have never seen it.
9776829	9777870	He's 9 and 3 quarters.
9778530	9779351	He's 9 and 3 quarters.
9779972	9781373	Anyway, okay.
9782714	9783314	Moving on.
9784215	9788599	DAF Square wants to know, when is Sky's Voice the game coming out?
9791187	9798069	Some... We'll get an MP3... I need some MP3 sent to me and I can make some... We'll see.
9799429	9799629	Yeah.
9800149	9800489	Let's see.
9802010	9805791	We have that one that Stressa made, and I don't know if Angel helped him with that or not.
9806471	9808671	No, I think it was all Stressa, because I know Stressa did the lyrics.
9809992	9814953	And he made this sim file of a parody that I did during a fuck-off show to Bumblebee.
9815353	9816614	and it's really embarrassing.
9816634	9817694	I can't believe... I played it on the show last week.
9817714	9821516	The damn thing is actually being pretty widely distributed right now, which is pretty scary to me.
9821536	9822596	I played it on the show last week.
9823136	9824377	Yeah, I know, and you played it on the show.
9824397	9825898	It would be the week before.
9826138	9828279	We need to do it from show and just sing.
9828919	9832060	Sing to the music, like, you know, sing lyrics to Afronova.
9834361	9835462	I will promise you guys...
9836642	9846867	There will be another MP3 of me singing on Orange Lounge Radio sometime in the next week.
9847108	9848628	You know what everyone missed, though?
9849068	9850109	This was a few weeks ago.
9851750	9853551	She's been on the show a couple times, Iguana Girl.
9853751	9860254	We were at Scandia doing our own version of Katimu to V. What song?
9860274	9861895	We were doing our own Katimu version of V.
9863217	9864558	and other songs.
9865298	9867839	I don't remember who was playing, but we were back there singing along with it.
9867859	9868339	It was great.
9870640	9876302	I promised the masses an announcer pack quite some time ago, so Loki, you've got to help me out with that, making an announcer pack.
9876322	9876762	We'll do that.
9876882	9877402	We'll work on it.
9878840	9882403	Black Lab wants to know, is there a Boba in your immediate future?
9883784	9886827	Probably not tonight, but maybe sometime this week.
9887267	9889509	Just because I'm really, personally, I'm really tired.
9889549	9891150	I was up until 5am last night.
9891330	9892171	And whose fault is that?
9893112	9896555	Mine, but that means I ain't going to Boba tonight, but maybe sometime this week.
9896575	9897936	Because I do kind of crave it.
9897976	9899057	I haven't had Boba at all this week.
9899737	9900998	Or what I mean, I haven't had Boba in a while.
9902840	9903520	So I think we need to go.
9903540	9904461	We need to take Loki then.
9905742	9907744	Loki, we need to go apartment hunting and then look for Boba.
9908633	9910313	Let me know when you're going to vote, because I'm going to vote.
9910333	9910473	Alright.
9911234	9915575	DarkTetsuya wants to know, how do I let someone know I'm interested, if you know what I mean?
9916055	9916775	Excellent question.
9917315	9918115	It's a pretty serious one.
9918395	9921076	You go up to them and go, you know what, I'm interested in you.
9921196	9921956	Would you like to date?
9922756	9923317	That's what you say.
9924397	9927077	To me, I mean, I'm a shy person too, honestly.
9927317	9930478	And it's so hard for me to just go up to somebody and ask that.
9930518	9931759	That's really bold.
9932259	9935319	Dude, okay, I'm the worst at doing that type of shit ever.
9935379	9937940	I like go up and be like, you're hot.
9939749	9941810	Okay, here's what you really have to do.
9942150	9944671	You have to keep cereal in your pocket to feed them.
9945352	9945892	Right, Ryan?
9946132	9947253	Back me up on that.
9947293	9947993	You gotta keep cereal.
9948013	9949754	You have to crunch on the can.
9950914	9957037	This is... As the resident woman... Okay, first of all... I'll be right back.
9957317	9957918	I gotta take a piss.
9959138	9961579	As the resident woman... Is that what you said?
9961859	9962640	Let Jamie speak.
9962820	9963420	Let Jamie speak.
9964140	9967382	I think it is absolute bullshit to drop hints that you like somebody.
9968644	9973950	You know, because, I mean, it's like, guys start acting really weird when they're interested in you.
9976032	9977734	And you think that they have a disease.
9978114	9980076	And so they start creeping you out and you don't want to be around them.
9980817	9981098	Okay?
9981598	9983941	If you like somebody, fucking tell them.
9984713	9988335	Get them by themselves and go, you know what, do you want to hang out?
9988595	9989956	Or you don't even have to say it right away.
9990096	9994758	Say, you know what, would you like to go to a movie or go anywhere?
9994998	9998740	Now that's a little more along the lines of, I wouldn't say you just come out and say, I like you.
9999100	10001601	But like, you know, find out, talk to the person.
10001621	10002722	People are going to talk to you.
10002822	10003802	Hey, how you doing?
10003982	10007484	And you talk and you find out what you have in common and then you go out and do that common thing.
10007944	10013307	But see, me as, and maybe I'm different among women because I don't like bullshit.
10014258	10017580	I'm like, if you want to go out with me, ask me if you want to go out with me.
10018601	10020081	Jamie, can I go out with you?
10020562	10020942	Of course.
10021762	10026465	No, see... I mean, I've gone out and said, hey, I think you're cool, I want to go out with you.
10027025	10028046	No, see, I'm too honest.
10028126	10033249	I'm like, you're hot, your face could use a little work, but you're still pretty hot, so you want to go out?
10033589	10034830	And then you'll be like, fuck you!
10037316	10039817	I think Jay Kinetic sums it up very nicely here.
10040217	10045120	Dude, try to get her to laugh at a joke, talk about a common topic, and then casually invite her out to have lunch sometime.
10045480	10046380	Two simple things.
10046700	10051222	First of all, don't have any of your friends do it for you.
10051662	10052563	Don't write a letter.
10053483	10055164	Just walk up and call them.
10055604	10055984	Remember it.
10056004	10056685	Talk to them.
10056725	10058906	Remember it.
10058926	10060086	Don't have your friends there when you ask.
10060106	10064368	If we've learned anything from Alamor, it's basically to go, I have money.
10066334	10091575	No, but actually, seriously, what you want to do is you want to definitely go up and tell them because if you waste time by just, like, beating around the bush and stuff, you're not only going to waste time, make yourself more stressed out, and, yeah, that might happen in the meantime, but it's better to, like, you know, instead of waiting forever and then telling her and she saying no to find out, you know, beforehand, you know, say, hey, I like you, hi, I'm not interested, or hi, I'm interested, you know,
10092316	10093217	Whatever she says.
10093457	10094618	Whatever she says back.
10094998	10097760	And never casually make out with somebody you're not interested in.
10098700	10099861	Wait, Tarma, man, that's fun.
10101182	10105225	No, because then, like, they might expect that you are interested in them.
10105265	10105545	Here it is.
10105925	10107166	I have the greatest pickup line.
10107386	10109388	Believe it or not, I have the greatest pickup line for women.
10109408	10110849	No, no, this is it.
10111249	10115292	It's like, no, you go up, you say, hey, I like peanut butter, wanna fuck?
10117916	10124301	Actually, the best pick-up line that I've heard of is, um, what was it, is like, uh, do you like jogging?
10126723	10138573	And, well, the thing is, is, is, it's gotten you in the conversation, it's not some awkward, you know, some pick-up line or whatever, and you should probably respond to that, you know, and then you're like, hi, my name is, you know.
10138613	10139374	Hi, do you like jogging?
10139394	10139854	Yeah, hi.
10141601	10142822	Did your wife like photography?
10142862	10143902	Hi, do you like casual sex?
10143922	10145763	Karen did pictures with Ashton Milling Lee.
10145783	10147605	It's like, no, okay, bye.
10147625	10149726	It's like, hey, do you like casual sex?
10149806	10149946	No.
10150106	10151567	Hey, do you like casual sex?
10151987	10152327	Yeah.
10152587	10153628	Hi, my name's Dave.
10153748	10155029	I love casual sex.
10155929	10157390	This is Bin Mani Loveline.
10157831	10159912	I think that we should get together and have some sometime.
10159932	10161133	Because, you know, common interests.
10161493	10162773	We both like casual sex.
10163514	10164414	And, yeah, go from there.
10164995	10170158	And, by the way, never, ever try to hit on somebody when they're working in an arcade.
10171198	10178402	This one really scary guy, when I was working at Aladdin's Castle, this one really scary guy came up to me and tried to pick me up.
10178602	10180903	I'm like, I have a boyfriend.
10181463	10182684	Oh, well, that's okay.
10182744	10184585	After you hang out with me, you won't want to be around him.
10184865	10188367	I'm like, sir, just being around you right now makes me very appreciative of my boyfriend.
10188927	10190748	Let me ask Neil, because he just walked in the room.
10190808	10192129	Neil, what's the best way to pick up chicks?
10193610	10195451	I said, hi, I like peanut butter.
10195471	10195931	What the fuck?
10196091	10196591	What do you think?
10198733	10199353	Nice shoes.
10201021	10202643	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
10217922	10221185	The best way to pick up a girl is with your arms and thin with your knees.
10222566	10223367	Alright, alright.
10223427	10223827	No, no.
10224108	10226209	I think we got the serious answer out.
10226570	10231955	The best way I ever hooked up with a guy one time, and actually this is an incredibly nerdy way but I thought it was pretty funny.
10232555	10239021	We played D&D and our characters hooked up and then we started dating.
10240543	10241384	Thank you for watching!
10257213	10263379	USFVB wants to know, which female targeted cartoons that most would be ashamed to admit they watched are your favorites?
10263859	10273628	For instance... Oh, uh... Okay, USFVB says, is the movie Jamie talking about called House Translation, which is from 1977, put out by Toho, I think.
10274969	10275510	I don't know...
10276360	10279583	I don't remember the name of it, but I knew that it was late 70s, early 80s.
10280444	10282685	And it had three people who ended up killing themselves in the end of the movie.
10282705	10282946	Look at that.
10282966	10284067	Look on Internet Movie Database.
10284127	10284427	Try that.
10284467	10284707	House.
10284847	10285328	Save that.
10285488	10286308	Actually, email that to me.
10286509	10291433	EOSFVB, if you would be so kind to email that to OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com, we'd love you forever.
10291653	10291893	All right.
10292614	10293815	Anyway, but ask for his question.
10293835	10297217	Which female-targeted cartoons that would most be the same to admit they watch are your favorites?
10297237	10298058	Somebody said Sailor Moon.
10298078	10298699	Who said Sailor Moon?
10299319	10299820	Oh, Anita's back.
10299840	10300080	I did.
10300220	10300921	I said Sailor Moon.
10301061	10301501	Sailor Moon.
10301881	10302262	Sailor Moon.
10302922	10304063	It was pretty cool.
10304783	10305724	A female-oriented cartoon.
10305744	10306624	You know what else is really sad?
10306704	10307405	Is Hamtaro.
10308105	10311307	I watched that horrible, horrible movie.
10313548	10315550	I don't know if anyone has heard this, Unico.
10316410	10317811	Yes, of course, Unico.
10317951	10318952	We all know you.
10319232	10321053	You know what I think is cool, by the way?
10321533	10326036	Is that guys can only get away with really watching guys' cartoons, but women can watch whatever the hell we want.
10326176	10327677	Well, what would be your favorite then, Jamie?
10327717	10328557	It's kind of a moot point.
10328577	10329298	For cheeky stuff?
10329418	10330538	Yeah, cheeky, girly things.
10332190	10333091	No, not Hello Kitty.
10333531	10337914	Well, I'm trying to think of stuff that's not anime, because there's shoujo and shounen anime.
10338775	10348181	I think as far as anime is considered, I would have to go with Pre-Tier, The Legend of Snow White, which none of you probably have ever seen.
10350383	10350683	Loki?
10351384	10354646	As far as guy stuff goes, it'd freaking be Berserk.
10355987	10358449	I don't watch freaking girly cartoons, so there!
10360404	10361184	Yeah, me neither.
10362625	10363245	I don't know what Unico is.
10363265	10364385	Did you watch The Last Unicorn?
10364966	10365706	I have the answer.
10365866	10370848	When I was a kid, when I was younger, when I was in junior high, it was all about the Beverly Hills teens.
10371088	10371328	Yes!
10371748	10373849	Oh my god!
10374869	10375830	Jem and the Holograms.
10375870	10376090	Yes!
10376770	10379891	I didn't really watch Jem, but Beverly Hills teens every damn day.
10380051	10382272	I have a friend who has every episode of Jem on tape.
10385444	10386085	Are they good quality?
10386225	10388827	Or, or, and or, and this is the gimme.
10389087	10391709	This is the one I'm sure everybody thought we would say, She-Ra.
10391789	10392129	Hello.
10392330	10393270	Okay, She-Ra.
10393991	10396653	But that was... With He-Man.
10397073	10398114	Yeah, She-Ra was kind of a Xena.
10398154	10401777	And of course, this subliminal message of both series, buy this toy.
10402618	10402858	Alright.
10402878	10403278	Buy this toy.
10403839	10404199	Moving on.
10404219	10405620	This is going to be the last question, you guys.
10408983	10409103	Um...
10412119	10413639	Hold on, I'm trying to read through what Jay sent me.
10413900	10417001	I think he was commenting on the relationship question.
10417041	10418041	We got it answered in the chatroom.
10418081	10419301	Okay, here we go.
10421442	10423863	Rice, RYC3 wants to know, question for the freestyler.
10423883	10424643	Sorry, I forgot your name.
10424663	10425263	That would be Bombay.
10426003	10428204	But anyway, anybody can answer this though.
10428244	10429905	Anybody that has freestyled in the past can answer this.
10430485	10430725	Yes.
10430885	10432845	How do you face your fear against the crowd?
10433766	10434146	How do I?
10434326	10434526	Okay.
10434626	10435366	Excellent question.
10435546	10436347	Okay, wait, Ryan.
10437187	10437407	Ryan.
10440629	10450798	Okay, alright, well, how I face my fear is, I basically, when you don't think, like, when you're up there on the stage, it's like the same as PA, when you PA, you think of PA, right?
10451298	10461767	The same thing with freestyle, when you're freestyling, you think about having fun, and, you know, just having a good time, you try not to think about, oh, what are they gonna think, you just have a good time, just be yourself, basically.
10462367	10466230	Here's the simple thing I've realized about freestyling altogether when it comes to the crowds.
10467010	10470753	Is, first of all, just imagine, or pretend that you're practicing alone.
10471073	10474655	There's nobody around you, and when you turn around, just don't see anybody there.
10475076	10478858	Because that way you're not going to feel nervous at all, because it's just like you're practicing and having a good time on your own.
10479899	10487184	No, like, what I do is, like, first of all, if you never want to feel nervous again, just first go up there naked.
10487504	10489906	And then, like, everyone will, like, laugh and bust out.
10490481	10494864	And then, like every other tournament, you'll just be like, man, this won't be as bad as last time when I was naked.
10497766	10502669	Honestly, that one and only freestyle that we did, I'd forgotten that there was a crowd all together.
10503009	10510034	And mainly, most of the time, the more outrageous stuff that you do that you would think would be embarrassing, people love it.
10510094	10513797	Like Ryan in his Afronova outfit.
10513817	10515318	And all the women would stand up cheering.
10516699	10517579	And so would Rob.
10519921	10520221	Anyway.
10520672	10524576	A grass skirt and a tiki mask, holding a spear, doing Afronova.
10525757	10526678	That was great.
10526959	10532404	My suggestion, my suggestion for the freestyle, because Jamie and I have done one freestyle, and it was pretty infamous, by the way.
10532585	10534727	You can find that video still on DDR for a good thing.
10534847	10536489	You guys have yet to watch that, and I won't ever.
10537129	10537870	I might have it somewhere.
10538611	10545637	Anyway, my advice, get up there and don't give a flying fuck what anyone in that crowd feels about you.
10545837	10547679	Just don't care what anyone thinks.
10547819	10551062	Go up there for yourself to have fun, to just do it.
10551142	10554746	And forget about everybody else, because their opinion doesn't mean shit.
10555206	10559751	And one thing, too, is when you freestyle, don't really give a fuck about the arrows.
10559992	10564517	Hit a few, but just mostly all people are watching is you dancing.
10564557	10565738	They're not watching the arrows.
10569202	10571905	Half the people who watch you freestyle don't even know what the fuck you're doing anyway.
10572466	10573907	They're just watching you dance.
10574207	10578068	So, fuck the arrows, hit just enough to pass, and have a good time.
10578308	10584090	And don't even worry if you look good or not, because if someone says you suck, challenge them to get up there and do the same.
10584691	10587852	I have an example of Kid Zero when he did Stomp to My Beat.
10588252	10588832	He failed!
10589152	10589833	He failed!
10590193	10594194	And everybody still was like cheering their asses off because it was such a good freestyle.
10594274	10595875	Even though he failed, it looked so good.
10596715	10600557	You may or may not remember at Shaft when Tran actually failed his routine the first time.
10600857	10602438	Crowd demanded he go again.
10603158	10608540	Because, well, I mean, there was also the other circumstance going on where he meant to do fourth mix and the fourth mix was broken so he had to do the sim.
10609120	10610561	But he ended up taking second place.
10610841	10611421	Not too shabby.
10614382	10617404	That was my bad for not turning auto-fail off.
10617804	10618104	Dope.
10621304	10622986	All right, so that's it for Ask Orange Lounge.
10623006	10623527	Thanks, you guys.
10623587	10624468	Good questions this week.
10624508	10624848	Very good.
10624908	10626711	Our chairman's getting very good at this stuff.
10626751	10626971	All right.
10627432	10629394	And they mostly said to be money.
10630676	10630936	All right.
10631917	10632698	That's it, you guys.
10633159	10634020	We're at the end of the show.
10635487	10665167	Okay, but we're gonna get around to the final thoughts So here's your chance Final thoughts, starting with the guests Bombay Okay, my final thought is to Scandia's policy It's kind of like a continuation of my fuck you It's a fuck you to Scandia's policy I work there, as people know now I work there, and on weekends they have a policy Friday after 5 o'clock is considered a weekend I'm not allowed to be there on weekends So Friday after 5 o'clock, I'm not allowed to be there Saturday and Sunday, I'm also not allowed to be there At all There, the end
10668388	10669228	In turn zero?
10670129	10670609	Pretty much.
10671809	10674250	Just goes along with the freestyle thing.
10674430	10675230	It's one last thing.
10676070	10677150	Just have fun with it.
10677311	10678331	Don't even care how you look.
10679111	10682532	And for everyone else playing DDR, just go and have fun with it.
10682692	10684553	Don't even bother what other people think of you.
10684913	10685973	I'd like to add something to that.
10686153	10689474	Also, just like, you know, look like you're having fun.
10689994	10692515	If you're up there concentrating too hard, it's not going to look good.
10692695	10693235	Absolutely.
10693275	10696396	Bruce Leroy, many say he won Cyber Beat on his expressions.
10696676	10696936	Period.
10697165	10705627	Well, and also when I was making up the grading sheets for Shaft, that was the big thing I had in there, you know, how well they react with the audience.
10707388	10709388	It counted for a quarter of their score.
10709488	10711429	Okay.
10712369	10714530	Hey, DVR College is back.
10715210	10715730	Have comments?
10717344	10729993	Well, I miss most of the show, but if you guys are talking about freestyling, my input would be to just have fun because it seems like no matter what happens, the crowd likes freestyling, even if you suck.
10730173	10733015	They don't want to see you just stomp.
10733196	10734517	They want to see you do something.
10736498	10741342	Find the closest person to the stage and go dry hump their leg.
10741362	10741662	Okay.
10742685	10743005	Winner!
10743105	10747367	Do anything and, you know, don't have any fear because there's nothing to fear.
10747987	10748287	That's it.
10749287	10756670	One last thing too is if little kids run across the crosswalk, feel free to kick a little leg out there and let them just do cartwheel right off the side of the thing after you kick them.
10758230	10760571	I'm wondering if anyone in here remembers Big Cans.
10762664	10766889	Rob's half-finished edit to Kick the Can started off really hard, and then there was nothing else.
10767089	10770754	I remember when the fourth mix was there at Golfland.
10770994	10774399	Yeah, it was Rick and Paul just ran off and started running all over Golfland.
10775796	10777818	They were like doing bar hops and slapping hands across it.
10777838	10780260	No, they hopped off and started running around the arcade too.
10780700	10782261	Yeah.
10782301	10787666	Me and Pat also, I wear orange beanie.
10788306	10790868	We also have a freestyle to Tsugaru.
10791048	10791889	No, Matsuragi Japan.
10792009	10792389	I'm sorry.
10794211	10798074	Where we just run around the arcade and just like, that's about it.
10799235	10800596	You love to meet Maniac Little.
10801256	10801977	Really?
10801997	10804859	There's like, what is it, 32 measures of no steps.
10804979	10805280	Really?
10806741	10807542	All right.
10807862	10808943	Anyway, your final thoughts?
10808963	10817431	My final thoughts, since we didn't cover it, the StepChart site went down, just so everyone knows, because that's, you know, kind of major news and stuff.
10817792	10819153	So StepChart site went down.
10819894	10821936	There's a new one coming back up, so look for that.
10822737	10823357	My site...
10824458	10825139	I'm working on it.
10826039	10830822	There's actually going to be a complete... I'm going to redo all the graphics again, actually, because I don't like the way they are right now.
10831002	10831963	And I'm going to make it simpler.
10832243	10844030	And if you're lucky, if you're very, very lucky, I might upload second style through fourth style all the DWIs I have for that tomorrow, if you're lucky.
10846471	10866558	All I gotta say is that me and Johnny, like, a few weeks ago, we started, like, it was at, like, 3 o'clock in the morning in my car, and, cause we were, like, parked outside someone's house, and, anyway, and so we were, like, really late, and we were trying to, like, rap and shit, and he's like, okay, David, go!
10867219	10867959	And so I'm like...
10868679	10876761	Yo, I went to McDonald's, and like, we started making all these weird names to like, uh, to fast food chains.
10877161	10881281	So now we have, we have, it's called our ghetto slang for fast food chains.
10881501	10881721	Yes.
10881781	10882682	Hey, that rhymed here.
10883002	10883962	Burger King!
10883982	10888183	Yeah, we have, okay, for now, for now, we have McDonald's.
10888583	10889603	That's McDonald's.
10889983	10891003	Burger King!
10891103	10895164	Burger King, and finally... No, no, no, we got two more, two more, yeah.
10896184	10903086	We got Delta Cop, which is Del Taco, and Jack in the Box is Jack in a Bow.
10903907	10904267	Yeah!
10904807	10906848	I'm sorry, I still prefer Yak in the Box.
10908268	10910249	Anyway, that's what we have.
10912669	10913570	Delta Cop!
10915170	10916151	Blink, blink, blink.
10916771	10921272	Alright, my final thought is that choking when you're drinking water live on air really sucks.
10922093	10922733	That just happened to me.
10922993	10923213	Jamie?
10923233	10923333	Jamie?
10924349	10926050	My final thought is that scars are cool.
10926950	10927470	Scars are cool.
10927710	10928190	They're sexy.
10928751	10929871	Thank you everybody much for listening.
10929891	10931331	Thank you all the guests for being here tonight.

10940635	10942435	Most likely studio of Jamie but we don't know yet.
10942475	10944356	And maybe I'll do a fuck-up on Thursday.
10945277	10949662	Alright, and the Cyber Beat special was delayed, so it's going to be this Friday and Saturday, because we got lazy.
