1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,840
Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:20,160
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,400
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,160
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,160
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,660
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,660
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,660
In this episode...

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,160
Hey, are there any balls down there?

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,660
About the biggest bear you've ever seen, Dingleberry.

11
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,660
What's your favorite scary movie?

12
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,160
Showgirls.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,660
Absolute fright.

14
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,660
What's yours?

15
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,160
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,160
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,160
Now's the time on sprockets and we dance!

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,160
I'll get you, my pretty. And your little dog, too.

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,160
I know kung fu.

20
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,160
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,160
Why did they have to take the word gang?

22
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,160
No! What he expects for Spanish expression is ken-to.

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,160
Hey!

24
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,160
Dark Sakura

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,160
Shut up! Where's my gun? This is my boomstick!

26
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
Skye

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,160
Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

28
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,160
Loki

29
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,160
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex and leave.

30
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,160
What kind of war human being would find that funny?

31
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,160
Orange Lounge Radio

32
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,160
We are live, and this is episode number 35 for March the 2nd of 2003.

33
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:53,160
into the Le Mani Scene's most crowded radio station of all things, Beeee, Le Mani.

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,200
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Skye. I'm a poet and I don't know it.

35
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,800
But your feet show up because they're long feathers.

36
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,960
My feet are big. You know what that means?

37
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,720
Attention guys out there, Rob wears big shoes.

38
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,320
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest and most loud-mouthed

39
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,600
bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

40
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,240
you know her better as Dark Sakura?

41
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:26,920
In that corner, say hello to our tech master Loki.

42
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,360
Also with us tonight, we have a whole ass load of guests.

43
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,120
Say hello to Sharks Girls in the house.

44
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,120
Everyone else is in the other room playing Animal Crossing, I'm thinking about joining

45
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,120
them.

46
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
Hey, traitor.

47
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,180
Hey, I gotta get Bones back.

48
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,320
And also with us, say hello to Mel B.

49
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:50,320
I believe that children are our future.

50
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,980
Say hello to Dave.

51
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,340
And there's a whole bunch of other people. Oh, say hello to Brad!

52
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,840
Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk.

53
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
Why are you bawking?

54
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,140
Ah, shit!

55
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,680
Oops, I had a little technical difficulty there, sorry about that.

56
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,680
Hi. Say hello. Oh, hi Brad. And then in the back is the Ice Queen.

57
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,680
Say hello to the Ice Queen. Come on in.

58
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,680
Wow, that's twice this month I've been called a douchebag.

59
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,680
Tell me Rob, do you feel

60
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,680
not so fresh? Oh yeah, so we're in a new month now.

61
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,680
So that means that somebody else has to call Rob a douchebag.

62
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,680
Who wants to take the turn this time? Okay, you can do it. Don't forget. April 1st.

63
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,680
I'm getting reports that all of our listeners might...

64
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:30,680
The beauty of silence

65
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:36,680
Turn the steps wide to orange flags This PDR stops all of us

66
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:47,400
Apparently, Dave knows what camel piss tastes like.

67
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,000
Tastes just like it smells.

68
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,160
Alright, we're back.

69
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,120
Unfortunately what happened just before the break, for some reason, we didn't show ourselves

70
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,480
this going down off the air, but all our listeners got dropped, so they're slowly coming back

71
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,000
on the stream, and it's kind of ironic that they should come back to the beauty of silence.

72
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:45,360
So, today is a little bit of a buzz show, I'm downing a Smirnoff Black with Mel, a toast,

73
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:52,040
to a non-crappy show for once, no I'm just kidding.

74
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,040
Who's all here?

75
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,040
Dang.

76
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,920
It sounded like five people just got here.

77
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Who got here?

78
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,800
We have Brandon, Brian, Anita, Johnny.

79
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Oh my god.

80
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Full House today.

81
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Today it is kind of a Full House.

82
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
Okay, so.

83
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Full House?

84
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Everywhere we go, everywhere you look.

85
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Okay, after what we were watching today that showed what's-her-face from Full House.

86
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
Candace Cameron.

87
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
Yeah, Candace Cameron.

88
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Oh, she looks kind of slutty.

89
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
What the hell ever happened to Candace Cameron?

90
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
She's very pretty.

91
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,360
Candace Cameron met a hockey player by the name of Valie Bure and got engaged in Paris

92
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,880
and got married and has two kids, go fig, and she looked like a slut for a long time

93
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,840
because she had platinum blonde hair.

94
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,460
But now she looks a little bit more respectable.

95
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,440
She kind of reminds me of that B-movie actress Beverly Lynn who did this really awesome movie

96
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,720
called Babes II, Lost in Beaver Creek.

97
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,080
Anyone who's down with Skinimax, it's a must-see and a must-hape and all that.

98
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,120
Okay, wait, hold on, hold on, I found some information on Candace Cameron, here we go.

99
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:01,120
at age twenty six candace cameron beer has accomplished a lot

100
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,600

108
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,460
Okay, and now I'm going to finish talking about Candace Cameron, Biaray.

109
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,460
Oh, Billy the big fat queer is here!

110
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,460
Say hello, Billy!

111
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,460
Hi.

112
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,460
How are you, Billy?

113
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,460
Peachy keen.

114
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,660
Wait, before I tell the story about Candace Cameron, no, because Billy would enjoy hearing

115
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,660
about Candace Cameron.

116
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,700
I would love to hear about Candace Cameron.

117
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,700
And then we're going to have a segment called Story Time with Billy, because I want Billy

118
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,700
to tell about all his experiences last night at Mardi Gras.

119
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,700
I gave some guidance.

120
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,700
Wait, no, no, no.

121
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,700
Hold on.

122
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,700
First, first, Candace.

123
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,700
Then your story.

124
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,700
Oh, hi.

125
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,700
You're listening to Orange Lounge of Omani Radio.

126
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,260
Sometimes we talk about the game with the arrows.

127
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,260
I hear it's popular.

128
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,260
Anyway.

129
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,820
And we talk about porn a lot.

130
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,140
Since her years as DJ...

131
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,140
B-Ray.

132
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,140
B-Ray.

133
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,140
Hello.

134
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,860
Rob, if you need to throw up the bathrooms down the hall.

135
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,700
I'm going to throw up in your lap.

136
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,340
Since her years as DJ Tanner on the long-running sitcom Full House, she has had the lead role

137
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:31,480
in six movies, guest starred on four television shows, and executive produced an entertaining

138
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,700
child safety show.

139
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:45,980
She is married to ice hockey player Valérie Biré, who sucks ass and has three children.

140
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,380
I don't want to know what their association is.

141
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:57,060
Their names suck, ass, and who?

142
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,880
Come here suck, come here ass!

143
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,940
Since I was ten years old, Candace has been a distraught role model for me through her

144
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:09,580
varied acting roles and admirable participation in organizations like the Starlight Foundation.

145
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,580
Which sucks ass.

146
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,580
Hey!

147
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,580
That's a charity!

148
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,980
It's an ass-sucking charity.

149
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:20,980
Her openness and love for Christianity is refreshing in the church of ass-sucking.

150
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:32,780
So she sucks little boys' asses then.

151
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,500
Refreshing is this nice malt beverage right here.

152
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,760
And then it talks about growing up with Candace.

153
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:45,280
So if you want to visit all about Candace Cameron, go to www.candascameronbure.net.

154
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,840
If you want to suck some ass.

155
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Okay.

156
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,160
Speaking of sucking ass, let's get to story time with Billy.

157
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,080
Wait, hold on.

158
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,080
Okay, Billy.

159
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,200
Yeah, I'm going to pull up some storytelling music just for Billy.

160
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,960
But yeah, I just want you to tell, you know, why you came down to Sacramento this weekend

161
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:08,380
and what you did last night and how it went and, you know, make it really long and exciting

162
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,380
because we have three hours to fill, okay?

163
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,380
I have to go soon. It's going to be short and sweet.

164
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,380
Well, try.

165
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,380
It was Mardi Gras night.

166
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,380
Wait, hold on.

167
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,380
Story time with Billy!

168
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,380
This better be the Jerry Halliwover.

169
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,380
It is the Jerry Halliwover. It's the DDR Jerry Halliwover game.

170
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,380
Tell your tale, Billy.

171
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,380
Well, it was Mardi Gras night, and we had quite a bit of fun, and I got a couple beats here and there.

172
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,380
Wait, and now how did you get beats?

173
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,380
How do you think?

174
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,380
Did you show your titties to some lesbians?

175
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:44,380
I did show my titties since I'm a lesbian, and then some cute boys just walked in and gave me these items to show me.

176
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,380
So anyways, on the way out, there was a cute drunk boy, and he's all,

177
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:53,380
I didn't give you these, so I'm like, what are you going to give me?

178
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,380
Billy just cut right to the chase! What are you going to give me?

179
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:04,380
He's all, I'll let you stick your hand down my pants, and I'm like, well, okay.

180
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,980
Not that I'm complaining. I've got quite a handful.

181
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,660
And then Matt got a C.

182
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,940
I got a hold of it and see it, so it was a wonderful fun night.

183
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,180
Oh, Matt's here. Matt, come here, come here. Do you have anything you want to add to this story, Matt?

184
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,980
Or, I'm sorry, the Ice Queen?

185
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,300
When he got the grab, I got the C.

186
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,420
He wanted some more beats, and he came up to me and said,

187
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,980
Well, what do I got to do to get some beats? And I said, Well, you know you got to do some of your stuff.

188
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:39,980
and

189
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,300
you know he asked for a piece for me to some michael's what do i get he said i

190
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,540
did the same thing

191
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,900
so i can simply

192
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,740
and make you know you open up his pants

193
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,500
and you know i thought i started looking at another and i'm like

194
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,300
no no honey i've got more class billy does

195
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,860
for

196
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:03,220
I was trying to start fights in the parking lot.

197
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:09,340
Yeah, sometimes we talk about some Arrow game, I don't know.

198
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,100
Build your gay sex quota, now it's time for...

199
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:19,100
Yeah, the show is getting too gay. Pussy, cunt, clit, cock...

200
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,780
Alright, quick, the chat room is getting restless because we haven't talked about anything but

201
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,820
Emani yet. So, Loki, give us a topic we can have a roundtable about.

202
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:35,700
Oh god, okay. Starting off this week, well obviously everyone knows that DDR Max 2, the

203
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,980
Japanese version, is coming out April 25th, I believe.

204
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,780
Which means that somebody has to buy that for me for my birthday.

205
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,700
Yes, April 25th. Also announced with it is going to be a brand new V-Rare CD, V-Rare

206
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,540
number 5. Which I don't get because once they mass produce

207
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:54,820
the CD, it's not really rare anymore. Shut up. Anyways, well, some of the things that

208
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,540
are going to be on it, obviously, is going to be the ability to make linked data for

209
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,420
DDR Extreme, which will be nice because you'll be able to actually record data for all the

210
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:08,580
songs instead of like half. And also, it's rumored to be that there's over 70 songs,

211
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:14,780
including some from DDR Extreme. Whoo! Which means you're going to see Dynamite, Rave,

212
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,780
Downbird Soda Mix, Look to the Sky, True Colors Mix, Do It Right, the Harmonize Two

213
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:26,780
Set Mix, Drop the Bomb, System FS Mix, and AM3P 303 Bass Mix. And that's it from DDR

214
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:32,180
Mac or DDR Stream. If they have La Copa de la Vida, I'll be like so happy, because that's

215
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,060
the best song ever.

216
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,060
Did you say it was a foreign language until Ricky Martin's song?

217
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,220
No. That's right, Billy, that's going to be...

218
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:44,420
I said it was like a foreign language until someone said Ricky Martin's song.

219
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,420
So yeah, that's what's coming out April 25th.

220
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,420
Okay, discuss.

221
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:57,420
Well, I for one am super excited about this, except I'm fucking broke and I have to move to the end of next month.

222
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,420
But, you know, I'll probably scrape some money out of the couch and buy it anyway.

223
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,420
That's okay, you can play mine. It'll be my birthday month.

224
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,420
Oh, gee, I can come over and play. That would be great.

225
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,420
Like hell, we're gonna buy one, dammit!

226
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,540
I was I was brought to you by we're gonna buy one so I can rip the songs and put them on the Internet

227
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:19,100
Okay stuff. Well, the thing is I don't know what if Konami happens to like be spying on me

228
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,380
But every time the game comes out my birthday's around there

229
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,220
It's just for me that affected you just released games I roll in a world

230
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:35,020
Okay, I have the tie into my life and know to release games around my birthday CDR max to

231
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:42,020
USA, November. Of course. Any idea what's gonna be on that? Are they gonna give us anything

232
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:47,700
special? Probably just like, you know, same thing as last time, maybe some more new exclusive

233
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:56,300
songs and whatnot. So, you know, nothing yet. Of course, we'll know more after E3, so. That's

234
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:02,420
true. If we can get into it, wink, wink, nudge, nudge. Mel's got his hand raised, hold on.

235
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:09,420
Why can't Orange Lounge get the hookup like what?

236
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:14,420
People who are engaged to Gamestop employees get the hookup?

237
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:20,420
Well, um...

238
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:27,420
Yes, Jason Enos actually hires a lot of DDR spot bemoniacs and other people to dance for him at the boots.

239
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,420
That's pretty much how we get our hookup.

240
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,140
extremely fashionable maybe that could you know go for something

241
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,920
but i'm surprised how everybody at e three looks good for some reason or

242
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,040
another

243
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,380
you can model a dance

244
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,980
i could be a dance mat

245
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,140
hey i want to dance pattern three

246
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,720
i've kicked everyone's ass at britney's like dance beat

247
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,940
uh... there's my claim to be released

248
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,100
your billy's new hero for being the britney's answer that

249
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,060
which also is about what he was kinda like last year is a lot of us can only

250
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:03,180
dream to go there Mel you've been there so what's it kind of like you go in the

251
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,900
doors is just like oh my god Disneyland for me pretty much you walk in there

252
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,940
it's like someone took Vegas and put it inside a convention center it's nothing

253
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:16,140
but neon lights everywhere you see like you know every brand name out there has

254
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,340
a billboard the size of like a freaking street you know the street billboards

255
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,180
everybody looks good not just the people who model off games but like even the

256
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,660
business exec women and guys I don't know you know it's like everyone's just

257
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,420
There's celebrities that roll through there like my boy Henry. He saw Robin Williams in there got you know a picture with him

258
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:38,780
I almost got was able to flag down Gary Coleman for an autograph, but he was in a rush. What you talking about Mel?

259
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:45,980
Our friend Ryan goes there every year and brings back a videotape, but this last year

260
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:51,220
He went and saw Bruce Campbell again and got Bruce Campbell to record his answering machine message

261
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,100
Wow

262
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,400
That's a serious hookup and yeah other celebrities like at the

263
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,060
THQ I think it was that Stacy Kubler freaking like

264
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,340
Come on Bruce Campbell on the goddamn radio show

265
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,080
Hey, just tell me tell me who I have to blow to get in the door and we're there. Okay?

266
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,460
Sorry, I didn't want to cut off your story

267
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,420
But yeah, pretty much III is just a blast and not only do you just see like what's new

268
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:27,420
It's all about the free stuff, man. It's all about just nabbing posters, friggin' demo discs.

269
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,420
Inflatable Morolians from Space Channel 5.

270
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,420
Oh, Inflatable Morolians from Space Channel 5. Those are great.

271
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:42,420
And just like all the stuff, and like, it's crazy because Nintendo's booth just gets like the biggest freaking line because everyone is just all about winning free stuff.

272
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:49,420
And that's where my boi, a couple of my bois won Wave Burt's from there. You know, right before they were out in the public and, yeah, that was the hot item.

273
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:54,420
I have to cut in really fast because Billy the big homo has to go, but I wanted to ask him if he has any final thoughts.

274
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,420
No.

275
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,420
Not even one?

276
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,420
Not even one.

277
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,420
A song lyric, maybe?

278
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,420
Final thoughts? Is this like Jerry Springer?

279
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,420
I just can't get you out of my head.

280
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,420
That's all I think about.

281
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,420
Alright, get out of here. Later.

282
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,420
Bye, Billy. Thank you.

Let's see.

293
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,060
I don't know.

294
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,300
I don't know too many people anymore.

295
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:55,420
Shout outs to all the DDR people out there who love DDR and all the money.

296
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,420
Alright.

297
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,420
Well put.

298
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,420
Thank you.

299
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,420
Alright.

300
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,420
Take care.

301
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,420
Be safe.

302
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,420
Have a good move.

303
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,420
Alright.

304
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,420
Alright.

305
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,420
So.

306
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:11,980
We should be able to get E3 tickets because we have word in the industry, right?

307
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,980
We want to go!

308
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:26,980
Well, probably the best thing you can do is just talk to Jason Enos, you know, because he gets, you know, for all his pull, he gets a lot of guest passes, so if nothing else, you may not get, like, the perks of media, which means you get to have, like, exclusive views of, like, say, you get media guides and, like, kits and all that stuff.

309
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,980
But you still get to go around and go everywhere else, you just don't get to go inside, like, behind the wall and get free food, but...

310
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,980
Oh, well. Bummer.

311
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,980
You know what? You'll take what you get and you'll like it.

312
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,980
I want free food!

313
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,980
My God, I feel like there's a party going on in the hallway.

314
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,980
If you've received tickets to your home address once, you will always receive tickets.

315
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,980
Even if you are no longer in the industry, you will always receive tickets.

316
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,980
I know, I got my thing in the mail about two months ago saying,

317
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,980
yeah, re-register for Ethereum, like hell yeah.

318
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,540
okay

319
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,660

320
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,540

325
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,660
asked the a question of the hour and there which is actually kind of funny

326
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,720

327
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,140

and fan service for the guys

334
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,560
and some of them

335
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,520
it's when all the big game companies get together to show off their new toys

336
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,200
and had seen it there a couple years ago today

337
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:03,200
all every like everybody's up in there

338
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,000
just walk up to him i mean you know

339
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,840
monday

340
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:14,840
my back up with the am i correct

341
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,140
i wanna go

342
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:25,640
and i don't like my work in a rather go

343
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,640
So I guess I'll talk to Mel B and Sharksko a little bit while you guys are still here.

344
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,640
Mel, how was Cyber Beat? What did you think of the tourney and all that?

345
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,640
Cyber Beat was, I guess personally, just one of the most fun weekends all together.

346
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,640
There's something to be about going to a tournament and yeah, it's fun if you win or it's fun for whatever reason.

347
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:54,640
But just being there and being able to go through just the whole competitive experience and seeing some of the people who've been just working their way up finally get to the top or get some recognition.

348
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,640
It was cool for them, definitely. I was happy to see, I guess, well, a lot of people are referring to the torch being passed.

349
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,640
You know, it's like the old school's kinda like making way for the newer, the new jacks, the new generation.

350
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:13,640
And I'm totally fine, because most people out there, like Bruce Lee or AJ and such, they've busted themselves pretty hard, and it's good to see them get some recognition for a change.

351
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:20,640
I mean, I wanted some, I wanted a slice of the pie, but it was cool. I'm glad people still, you know, like to see me out there and whatever.

352
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,640
Cool, cool deal.

353
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,640
I have to ask you guys, Sharkskroll, I know you are huge on the Derby Owners Club.

354
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,640
I'm trying to break myself up, but I haven't played it since the last time you were in the Bay.

355
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,640
Oh no, I was going to ask if you went to that tournament that they had in Milpitas.

356
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,640
I kind of didn't even realize it was happening because I thought it was the following week.

357
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
What have you been up to lately then, girl?

358
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,640
Work, I see MLB and then I go to sleep, and that's about damn near it.

359
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,640
Well, you know, gotta do what you gotta do.

360
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,640
Sucks for the record, but that's okay

361
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:58,000
On a side note okey actually won the Derby on how the hell did that happen? I coached him in the final match

362
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,600
See Ross actually was kicking a lot of ass

363
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,560
He had the most wins and had the most money, but the last match was a g1

364
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,760
Which is like the big high stakes and I know he was just asking me for advice

365
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:16,300
I'm like do this right here hold the horse right there whip it right there BAM wasn't even close Wow. That's pretty cool

366
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,300
Doesn't Derby Owners' Club handicap you if you're behind or something?

367
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,300
Only in one certain race.

368
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,300
But everything else is skill to the player.

369
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,300
I wonder how well Polteri would have done.

370
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,300
Yeah, because the last time I raced I remember Polteri won like her second race.

371
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,300
And I was actually racing, I think I was racing Ross in that one, I don't know.

372
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,300
I was racing some of the better players and I won.

373
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,300
And I was like, how the hell did I win that? My horse sucks.

374
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,300
And somebody was telling me, oh, they handicap it.

375
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:47,300
And I still have the picture, I still have the picture that says Pollotary is very happy.

376
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:54,300
Pollotary, the horse, rules. I'm sorry, hot man sex still rules.

377
00:25:54,300 --> 00:26:02,300
Okay. So, alright, how about we take a quick break, and then we come back and we're going

378
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,420
to do the FUs of the week before the people have to go, because I know we certainly have

379
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:09,860
a lot of angst. Yeah, we're going to have another three hour long FU segment. No, well

380
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,940
This is what we'll do.

381
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,820
Everybody in the studio can F you as much as they want.

382
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,260
But everybody in the chat room will limit to like three FUs.

383
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:15,860
OK.

384
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,660
So chat room, send your FUs on to me over a private message.

385
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,300
But three at the most.

386
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,580
Because we don't want this to go on forever.

387
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,260
All right, so.

388
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,820
OK, so yeah, we're going to, somebody turn the mic off.

389
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,780
uh-oh

390
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,300
that was uh... the other line

391
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,020
uh... yes i would like to call the other line

392
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:50,580
we're going to let me see that when i had a phone that had a pause that would

393
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,980
meet the line

394
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,420
i would

395
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,820
and people that i had call waiting since i got tired of talking to them at the

396
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,100
i'm sorry that was from a grandma that has let you go

397
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,520
uh...

398
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,620
it's cool like when you have

399
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,580
when you have to be fun

400
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,420
he just was it

401
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:13,420
and see how long it takes people to actually think you've hung up on us.

402
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:41,580
Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah

403
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:11,420
He made me feel like I was lost in the circle of time

404
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,420
Who said

405
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:20,420
Yeah, baby, this is my home, so come on

406
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:34,420
We can touch it, hold us to your feet I know you feel it, but I ain't no fool

407
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:40,420
You need to make a man you hate You need to have the power

408
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:20,420
And you make me feel high, and you defend the power

409
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:44,020
who are in everything else. I just like that one because I like the background.

410
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,740
And it's really easy to PA, I think. That's why I like it.

411
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,020
You know what I want to say? What?

412
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:52,420
I want to say is, where's 2MB? We need some more 2MB remixes.

413
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:55,300
There's Trip Machine Survivor? That's not 2MB.

414
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,620
Isn't it? I don't know. That's just Desire.

415
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:02,340
We need 2MB. You know what the next song is going to get the 2MB treatment? It's going

416
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:06,140
to be fucking Bag. Bag sucks ass, okay? It's just like a rhyme.

417
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:11,140
I'm trying to make a trans version of Bag, The Legend of Bag, or The Legend of Haggis.

418
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,140
They already have The Legend of Bag sucks.

419
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,140
Do they really?

420
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,140
Yeah.

421
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:25,140
Okay, the worst fucking remix I heard this week, the Legend of Max unlimited 300 or something like that, is not even a remix.

422
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:33,140
It's like, okay, let's just stop it, start playing Max 300, stop it again, it's not a remix. It's just awful.

423
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,140
Oh, cool!

424
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:38,040
No, I haven't heard Climax.

425
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,900
Also reading the chat room, and if you're not in her chat room, you should join it.

426
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:46,980
Just go to her website, orangelounge.skie.cx and click on chat.

427
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,980
She's playing Snake.

428
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,320
And I'm just reading some things that are going on in the chat room right now.

429
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,360
We have someone who hates Polteri almost more than we do, it looks like.

430
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,240
We have Satome Ranma says, you know what's great?

431
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,220
The songs that are credited in Aoki All Stars and all it is is Polteri, with little voices

432
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:08,660
the background. God damn her taking over DDR. I swear she's like a cancer.

433
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:13,820
Paula Terry. I have to say, to her credit, lately she's been able to hold a key, but

434
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,540
I think that's just because someone's been beating her over the head more and more. You

435
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,580
know, it's like, okay, it's like, for anyone who's ever been in band, you know, you can

436
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,580
buy an instrument and it can be built out of tune. Well, I think that Paula Terry has

437
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:28,260
been built out of tune. So they did what they do with some instruments and beat them into

438
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,260
shape

439
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,380
Brad would be so mad at you right now

440
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:34,340
actually you know what they've got right now it's pretty cool I saw this on tech

441
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,100
TV today

442
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,760
for when you're doing like karaoke and stuff what will happen is you can sing

443
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,020
all out of Keith but when it comes out of the speakers it makes you in Keith

444
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,100
it like compensates

445
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,860
what was that machine in Josie and the Pussycats the

446
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,140
the one the big machine they had that would make them all in tune

447
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,660
not the Mr. Movie Phone there was something else and then it had the subliminal messages from Mr. Movie

448
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,300
Phone you know

449
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,300
Purple is the new orange.

450
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,300
You know, he's talking about that machine that you can sing out of key and sing in key.

451
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,300
That's probably how you got a hundred points on that.

452
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,300
Hey, hey, hey, I don't like where you're going with that, mister.

453
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,300
I don't like where you're going with that.

454
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,300
I actually, you know what, maybe I can find it later.

455
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,300
No, I couldn't play it during the actual show, but I do have Irene and I.

456
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,300
I taped Irene and I singing Boys.

457
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,300
I remember.

458
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,300
We got a hundred on it too.

459
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:22,300
One day at Rob's old apartment in Roseville, when I had laryngitis,

460
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:28,820
Rob's standing, tall while everyone was sitting, with his hand to the side, diva-style singing

461
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:36,260
that I'm Like a Bird song, with his eyes skyward, and I'm sitting here going, God damn I'm glad

462
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,340
I have laryngitis.

463
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:45,700
I have a very vivid memory of just this, like, Rob's on stage with the spotlight on him,

464
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,340
and he's got a feather blood.

465
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,900
Now, that's going to be DDR Idol.

466
00:35:49,900 --> 00:36:15,600
The only thing that any of us from Sac-Bimani are doing is admin work and running the 2DX

467
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,600
portion of the tourney.

468
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,180
It's going to be pretty intricate.

469
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,880
Rules will be posted within the next few days, possibly as soon as tomorrow, and it's going

470
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,880
to be cool.

471
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,880
I think you guys will like it.

472
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,320
A lot of people are coming from out of town to do it.

473
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:34,920
As far as Perfect Attack goes, there's rules posted on DDRSpot.com, DDRFreak in the tournament

474
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,040
forum.

475
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,620
They're going to be on SACBimani as soon as we get the site up.

476
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,620
As we all look.

477
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:48,200
I'll put something together then.

478
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,200
Do you have any answering questions and then beating people with bats?

479
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,200
Actually, you know, I'm thinking about auctioning off my bat.

480
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,200
What's it about you're going to put your bat on the new DDR Freak Marketplace or something?

481
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,200
No, I'm just going to go around and hit people in the head with it and go,

482
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Hi, you've been beaten by some of the most famous people in the big money world.

483
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,200
You've actually hit yourself with a bat?

484
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,200
Question for Loki from the chat room, and I already think I know the answer.

485
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:22,200
But, apparently the rumor is you can triple-A Fuhurata's theme. Is that true?

486
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,200
What?

487
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Somebody in the chat room is asking if you can triple-A Fuhurata's theme. Ninzapro.

488
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,200
No? I can't triple-A shit, man. I totally suck at PA.

489
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,200
Somebody claims they played DDR with you and you triple-A'd it.

490
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,200
Okay! I wish I was there because I only played doubles.

491
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,200
So, how much drugs were these people doing?

492
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,200
I don't know.

493
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,200
I only played doubles, and if I triple-a'd that, I mean, that would be pretty sweet, but no.

494
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,200
I might have triple-a'd it on basic.

495
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:59,200
I double-a'd Rhythm and Police on my new pads that suck.

496
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,200
You know what fucking sucks? Again, one great on all these EX songs.

497
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,200
I can't get my fucking triple-a on heavy. I always get one fucking great.

498
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Oh, that brings me around to the FUs.

499
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,200
I can't even get one grade. I'm five is my best, I think, but no.

500
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
Back to March Madness.

501
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,200
Oh, hi, yes.

502
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,200
I've played for about the same time.

503
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,200
4th place?

504
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,200
Yeah, but where's their 4th place in the red?

505
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,200
I don't know, the guy's in Iowa, so that's a really good question.

506
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,200
Where was I in Iowa?

507
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,200
This is actually turning into a pretty good story.

508
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Holy crap, you have a job now?

509
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,200
On the dream plane, no.

510
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,400
Now back to March Madness, hello.

511
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:47,200
The dates for the tournament are March 29th, March 30th, it will be at Scandia in Sacramento.

512
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:53,520
There's addresses, there's directions, everything's going to be posted in one form or another.

513
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,880
But we're going to be giving updates throughout, and like we were saying, we should have rules

514
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,660
for the 2DX tournament posted this week.

515
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,880
And it's going to be fun, right?

516
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,200
Yeah, it's going to be fun.

517
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,200
Fun.

518
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
It'll be exciting.

519
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,240
exciting it will it will make people's heart race it'll bring a couple of

520
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,720
thrills oh yes I still want my home run derby tournament for March Madness we

521
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,680
are actually working on that I did I actually did leave the suggestion for

522
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,800
doing the I just we didn't get to talk about it in depth but I did leave the

523
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:32,240
suggestion for this is the this is the bummer no bang a ball for dollars I had

524
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,160
suggested that we possibly at scandia's have bumper boats of scandia that we

525
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,320
have a wet t-shirt contest in the bumper boats however unfortunately they can't

526
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:47,400
do that it's a family environment because I work there okay you got you

527
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,280
got the inside on the bumper boats all right I can make that happen trust me

528
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,840
there my my my co-workers would probably in fact you know enter a couple people

529
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:02,440
they know in the contest I'm totally serious too this is the problem from what

530
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:08,080
What I told, a big radio station here in Sacramento, the rock station in Sacramento, did a big

531
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:19,520
as I hear the grunt from the former intern, they used to do a undie 500 on the raceway

532
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,400
where they would get all these strippers to go out in their underwear and race in the

533
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,120
race cars and they would have the tarp that goes around so that people can't look in because

534
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,280
what happens ten minutes after the green light goes on, the clothes come off.

535
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,840
So, unfortunately, some little kid decided to rip a hole in the tarp and look through

536
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,000
it and go home and tell his parents and ruined it for everybody.

537
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,880
Mommy, mommy, I saw boobies!

538
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,480
Dad's going to park his car in your garage!

539
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,760
Why would you, why would you go run home and tell your mom?

540
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,720
It's like, mom, look, I saw boobies!

541
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,720
Oh, okay.

542
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,520
Don't tell your mom that.

543
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:57,000
Since I, like, used to be the intern there, I'll tell you right now, 95% of the contests

544
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,240
they have are all horrible ideas.

545
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:03,400
like that one because they don't ever think of what can happen they just think

546
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,080
what's gonna get the most like 40 year old dirty guys out there that's all it

547
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:18,040
is people doing it in the church that was good radio so what can we go like

548
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:22,040
hire people to go to go to the Presbyterian Church down the road and go

549
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,640
hey you know it's gonna be interesting though because we will be broadcast

550
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,400
The Orange Islands Radio will be broadcasting live all day long, both days.

551
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,360
We're going to have a lot of help this time.

552
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,360
We're not leaving one person in control of the night.

553
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,880
We're not going to be constrained in the corner.

554
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,880
No, this is going to be great.

555
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,880
If things...

556
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,880
That was your trial by fire.

557
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,600
If things work out like we're hoping, Orange Islands Radio is going to have its own little

558
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,960
freaking temple.

559
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,960
That day.

560
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,960
It's going to be awesome.

561
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,960
Can I get a squirt gun to shoot people with?

562
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,960
Yes.

563
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,960
Yes.

564
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,960
Okay.

565
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,960
I have a squirt gun that looks like an Uzi.

566
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,960
Okay.

567
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,960
March?

568
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,660
No, it actually it actually is just a water gun, but it looks exactly like an Uzi

569
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:04,620
It was part of my Jill Valentine costume for a Resident Evil ax the first time I played DDR was just as Jill Valentine

570
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:09,620
That's very on a DDR machine. Did you play Silent Hill? I know Steve no

571
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:15,340
Actually, my first song that I ever played on third mix was dynamite. No with Xanadu

572
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,860
of course and then and then dynamite rave in

573
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:24,860
In army boots! Never play Gen. Raven army boots, by the way, especially ones that aren't broken in.

574
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:29,860
Ah, 23rd Magus has a zing here. We'll be broadcasting from the Temple of Butt.

575
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:34,860
Come inside the Temple of Butt!

576
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:39,860
We should hang a little side. It's too bad Scandia is the family fun center. It'll have to be the temple of...

577
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:44,860
So what are we going to do, Barbecued...

578
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,860
Rob, what are we going to do, Barbecued Fried Clams?

579
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:55,820
Oh all right okay that goes in pride class y'all are dirty

580
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:04,300
to do for a while we're going to buy a hundred tacos at from Del Taco just

581
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,780
because we can and we're gonna give them to everybody at March Madness just

582
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:11,500
because we can here have a taco yeah exactly you're like hey we're gonna

583
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,860
bought a hundred you like one by like a hundred of them and then just start

584
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:21,860
hand in mouth to people as they walk in for no apparent reason.

585
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,860
You guys have to come if you're in the area.

586
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:51,860
I can't say anything officially on this yet, but keep your eyes on all the boards.

587
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:52,860
Keep listening to us.

588
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:55,860
Because there might be a little bit more to this tournament.

589
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,860
Are you talking about the power station bit?

590
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,860
Because that has been official.

591
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,860
It's official.

592
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,860
It's a twist greater than Joe Millionaire.

593
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,860
Look out.

594
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,860
Our tournament is also...

595
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:05,860
It's an all new tournament.

596
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,860
That's a twist.

597
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:10,860
The tournament is also going to serve as qualifiers for that other one.

598
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,860
It's going to serve as qualifiers for the big power station tournament,

599
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,180
Which is this chain of arcades, I believe, and maybe you know a little more about this,

600
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,180
Mel?

601
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,180
I don't know.

602
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,140
I think there's going to be somewhere around three qualifiers, I believe.

603
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:25,460
Two in SoCal, I think one in Resume, two in SoCal, and one in NorCal, and this of course

604
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,460
being the first.

605
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,420
Yeah, it's going to be an invite-only contest.

606
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:33,700
Yes, I believe top three from each competition will be invited to the big power station for

607
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,500
a thousand bucks in prizes or more.

608
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,860
Then we do have a twist.

609
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:40,920
At March Madness, ladies and gentlemen, top six will be qualifying, so if you want a good

610
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,920
chance of qualifying...

611
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,920
I think I better get on the bus then.

612
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,920
Is this for PA or something?

613
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,920
Or freestyle?

614
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,920
Freestyle.

615
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,920
And PA.

616
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,920
Oh, you've got to enter PA, Dave.

617
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,920
You might qualify for the power station.

618
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,920
You could walk away with fabulous casting prizes.

619
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,920
Oh, boy.

620
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,920
I don't know if a fourth makes giving away.

621
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,920
If you don't enter the 2DX tournament, I'm going to kick you.

622
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,920
But I'm not good at 2DX.

623
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,920
Brad and DJ Syndrome are good.

624
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,920
DJ Syndrome can't enter.

625
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:22,040
is helping us run it so are you going to enter fine all right they were asking

626
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,320
me if I was gonna enter I got a chuckle out of that one well there might be

627
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,480
incentive for even the bad people to be entering the people who don't consider

628
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,800
themselves good at 2dx there's even incentive for you guys to enter it's

629
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,800
It's just a surprise.

630
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,800
I look like a fucking retard going,

631
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,800
Ahhh! Ahhh! Buttons! Ahhh!

632
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,800
You know what's funny? It's the way the 2DX machine is at Scandia right now.

633
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,800
Like, you know how the buttons light up and they flash?

634
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:50,800
On the one player's side, the 2 key and the 6 key are burned out.

635
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,800
So you have the 4 on the bottom and then the middle one.

636
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,800
It looks like a giant middle finger.

637
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,800
Because you have these 4 ones on the bottom and then one that's kind of raised up above the others.

638
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,800
So, it's kind of cool.

639
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,440
and little does everybody know, but all the right side players had a hand in that.

640
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,720
Right side pride!

641
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,920
whatever whatever

642
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,600
whatever

643
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,500
Am I the only one that plays left side in here? I think so. Shit! Shit!

644
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,120
I'm outnumbered!

645
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,920
I'm not the cheese, I'm the princess. Alright, anyway.

646
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:27,240
I'm also a model and an actress! I'm also a model and an actress, so fuck you two!

647
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,160
Black Lab says, and he's making a pretty big claim here, Black Lab is going to enter Perfect

648
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,360
Attack and beat Tigger. He doesn't say he's going to win, he just sees he's going to beat

649
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,120
Tigger.

650
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,360
We need this on film.

651
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,640
Puppy's making a call.

652
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:44,600
And sadly enough, about 90% of the whole world is kind of, you know, hoping that would happen

653
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,800
too.

654
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,960
No offense, Tigger. Good guy. Just god damn it, lose for once.

655
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:55,960
You know, I still got giddy when you beat me. I still have a smile.

656
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:59,960
I tried to be humble about that because I know it was a luck. It was just total luck. One great, it was luck.

657
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,960
You know what? I only lost the Tigger by like 32 greats.

658
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,960
I was close.

659
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,960
Good job!

660
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,960
It was like, that's like, you know, fingers, toes, fingers, and a couple toes.

661
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,960
I mean, we were playing Can't Stop Falling in Love, Speed Mix, and he got like 9 and I got like 40. It was close.

662
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,960
But he had it by a little bit next time.

663
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:26,800
You know, just for the fun of it, I think that even I would enter this if I wasn't running

664
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,640
half of it, you know?

665
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,640
I would enter this condo, actually, I know somebody that's going to be entering and I'm

666
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:38,400
helping this person train, so, you know, I'm pretty close to, so we'll see what happens.

667
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,120
But this person will be entering DDR Idol and it will be fabulous, I guarantee it.

668
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,120
Oh.

669
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,120
So, anyway.

670
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,800
Do we want to do the FUs of the Week?

671
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,120
Yes, I need angst.

672
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:55,120
We need you to explain the FUs of the Week, because we have some new folks listening.

673
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,800
How much do you have to explain what the fuck you mean?

674
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,460
Just give the brief rundown of the, Jamie I'm going to do it for you, the fuck yous

675
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,460
of the week.

676
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,040
Alright, that made me happy.

677
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,360
Basically this is where we talk about stuff that pisses us off.

678
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,360
The end.

679
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,000
Love, Jamie.

680
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Alright, then on that note, let's get to it.

681
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,200
This is fucked up.

682
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,960
My first fuck you week goes toward people who drive slow in front of me.

683
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,760
As in, like, the grandma from earlier today.

684
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,000
She had around her license tag,

685
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,920
Quilting keeps grandma off the road.

686
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:44,040
Why was she on the road? And why was she taking off her wig in her car?

687
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:51,040
She's like, oh, I'm driving 20 miles an hour, I'm going to take off my wig and scratch my head. Oh, let me adjust it.

688
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,120
You know, I have nothing against old people.

689
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,400
Except the way they drive.

690
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,520
But I have things against old people who can't drive.

691
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,680
I think that when you reach, like, maybe 60 or so,

692
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:07,680
you need to retake your full driving test to make sure that you're capable of operating your vehicle

693
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,680
like the rest of the world

694
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,080
the other thing on the other part of the week is for speed limit

695
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,880
why is it

696
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,220
is it like forty just a suggestion

697
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:20,140
cause everybody else who goes down el camino or arden

698
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,860
goes fifty to five

699
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:28,860
or pharaohs in the morning on my way to work and the other thing goes toward the guy who told us our car couldn't heal and shit

700
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:34,940
i still don't have my title yet

701
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,940
Um, all the way back to Trent.

702
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,940
Um, my other one goes toward, um...

703
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,940
Um...

704
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,940
I forget.

705
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,940
Jeremy for being a butt all weekend.

706
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,940
My cat.

707
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:50,940
My sweet baby.

708
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:51,940
Who's been a butthole all weekend.

709
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:54,940
I mean, she's been a butthole to me, too.

710
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:59,940
And my other one goes toward, um, our Neo Geo.

711
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:20,180
I've been trying to apply for a position at my old job as an internally posted, and under

712
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:26,460
the terms of my displacement, I am eligible to apply for this job until March 17th, because

713
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:32,460
I'm still considered technically an employee of the company, just not officially. I'm a displaced employee.

714
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:40,460
Well, Julie, who was kind enough to send in all this stuff for me, gets an email or a call or something from one of the HR people and says,

715
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,460
No, she can't apply for this because she has dysplasia.

716
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:45,460
Whoopsie, what the hell, that completely contradicts my dysplasia.

717
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,460
So I'm going to call them and say this,

718
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:55,460
Okay, if I can't apply for this job, then you need to create a petition for me like you did with, I won't say her name,

719
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:58,460
But they had another employee there who quit.

720
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:01,460
Two weeks, she actually, the day after she started this new place,

721
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,460
she gave her notice there and came back there.

722
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:07,460
They created a job for her, which completely goes against HR policy.

723
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:10,460
So I'm going to bring that up, and if they don't give me a job,

724
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,460
then I'm going to report them to the employment board.

725
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,460
And then after, if I don't get a job by May 17th,

726
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,460
I'm going to report them to OCC and the health board.

727
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:21,460
Health board for the state of the breakthrough.

728
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:22,460
Don't fuck with Jamie.

729
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,460
Oh, no.

730
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:27,540
And you know, and you know this, after working in customer service, it's like, you know,

731
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:30,900
they give you this example where every one person complains there's eight more people

732
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:35,160
who's pissed off, and then they're going to tell people, but the only people who ever

733
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,660
get anything done are the ones who do something about it.

734
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:38,980
So, screw it.

735
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:44,440
If somebody gives you a hard time anywhere that you've been, bad service, you name it,

736
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,660
you make sure someone knows about it and you get it fixed, because nothing changes until

737
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:48,660
you make a change.

738
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:51,340
You're going to do something big enough to cover for those other eight people.

739
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,340
Exactly.

740
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,340
I'm sorry.

741
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:57,340
And I want to do what I can to make sure those other people get off their asses and take care of the business.

742
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:01,340
You know? I don't stand for that. If I can help it.

743
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,340
Pre-challenge system.

744
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,340
What?

745
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,340
I got a face. F that face.

746
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:08,340
I'm done now!

747
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:14,340
Okay. Let's move on to Loki!

748
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,340
I think this court's long enough.

749
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:28,340
Um, well first one, first FE I have has a story behind it. Now I read on Yahoo News there's this guy, he's suing the movie industry for all the trailers that they have on, um, before the movie and the commercials.

750
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:37,340
Because, you know, most of his time is like, say, $4.45 to $6.21. Or, in this case, it would be like $5 million.

751
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:42,340
Well, F you to that guy because you suck! You can't wait fucking 5 minutes to see the damn movie! I had to wait fucking 15 minutes!

752
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:46,340
No wait, no wait, no, I agree with that guy. F those commercials.

753
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:48,340
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not- Shut up, trailers are fine!

754
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:50,340
Shut up! Okay, I haven't even gotten there yet.

755
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:55,340
Hey, F you! No, listen, this is my- this is- this is my time, okay.

756
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:58,340
So F you to that guy because you can't wait fucking five minutes,

757
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,340
and F you to the fucking thingers for putting commercials.

758
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:04,340
Then trailers! In which case, then you've got UK-

759
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:09,340
Okay, before Daredevil today, there was two fucking trailers for X-Men 2.

760
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:15,020
right after each other hello no it's different trailers but it's not the point the whole point

761
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:18,620
is there's two fucking trailers of the same goddamn movie i didn't forget they just saw a

762
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:24,140
trailer right before the last one god and f you the super movie industry for continuity issues

763
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:29,020
hello make your movies make sense when you see a reflection someone's glasses the exact same way

764
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:34,620
as looking at it it doesn't make sense and they have like a part in daredevil okay where they've

765
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:39,920
got this chick and uh... mlecra and daredevil fighting for no apparent reason he met her

766
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,960
hi how you doing i don't like being attached so they get in this fight scene and stuff

767
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:50,440
happens for no reason which fight scene are you talking about when he first met her in

768
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:57,440
the park that was because like um don't spoil no spoilers it was that they're like hey let's

769
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,740
It was tight, they were like, hey, let's have a fight scene for the flight.

770
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:02,240
It made no sense! Made no sense!

771
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,340
Okay, so enough with that movie industry thing.

772
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:09,640
F.E. to Wells Fargo for not sending me a fucking replacement card when mine expired,

773
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,940
and I had to wait. First, I had to wait in line for 30 minutes,

774
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:16,440
while some stupid person's like, I don't want to wait in line for five minutes.

775
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,640
So, you know, he left, and then he came back and made another scene

776
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:23,340
saying how he wants to get his money, and they said no, and then he left.

777
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:27,740
So I had to wait in line for that then to tell me to call an 800 number to get my card.

778
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:32,640
What the fuck's the bank for if everything I need from the bank is through the 800 number?

779
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,140
Why the hell does the bank exist?

780
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,840
This is why Jamie makes it safe.

781
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:42,140
So that's just stupid, so I called the number and yeah, they were nice at least on the phone number.

782
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:46,540
Um, F.U. is stupid old people, just because you're old and stupid.

783
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:50,040
And uh, and F.U. is the Burger King,

784
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:54,040
Because no, I don't want to donate a fucking dollar to help children get wheelchairs.

785
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,040
They can rot in hell.

786
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,040
They were born defective and they should die defective.

787
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,040
Oh my god, you're awful!

788
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,040
So, enough of that.

789
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,040
And...

790
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,040
Oh my god!

791
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:12,040
I wonder if this means in the future when everyone has test tube babies.

792
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:16,040
You know, I'm sorry my child arrived, you know, with this part wrong.

793
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,040
Can I just have order replacement part?

794
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:25,040
part

795
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:30,160
and you know what i don't care about like all the stuff that's going on with the news

796
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,480
how they're talking about saddam

797
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:35,040
you know disarming, arming, doing whatever in korea

798
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,160
well seriously, does korea want to get blown out of the sky? I mean seriously

799
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:42,720
there's like, hey we're building nukes now, oh sorry we don't care about you, we're talking about Iraq

800
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,480
well we just fired a missile

801
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,080
see we can do that now

802
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,740
We don't care about you. Well, we're amassing an army. What? You want us to come over and

803
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:54,080
nuke you? Is that what you want? Are you asking us to do it? I mean, because I'm sure we'd

804
00:55:54,080 --> 00:56:00,080
be just fine at doing that. I mean, seriously, it's like, hello, I'm here. Hello, North Korea!

805
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:05,080
Hello! I mean, it's so stupid. It's like, you're not even a full country. You're north

806
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:10,080
part of a continent. Or part of a continent. God.

807
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:14,880
You're more like the toenail of a continent. Seriously, North Korea. That's like North

808
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:21,880
Dakota attacking us, I mean, it's stupid! God dammit! The views and opinions expressed

809
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:27,400
on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff. And there

810
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:33,720
is a missile silo in North Dakota. Look, he has funny angst. God, I had other things,

811
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:40,720
oh, oh yes, an F-B to my stupid Cypher V Nation pad, whatever the fucking stupid pads I got!

812
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,720
that's it, because they bend after one fucking game.

813
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,720
These nice pads, you know, fucking bend, like, instantly.

814
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,720
They're supposed to, you know, support 300 pounds.

815
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:55,720
I think if someone stepped on those 300 pounds, the pad would just, like,

816
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,720
just disintegrate and reject you.

817
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,720
Oh, yeah, and one final F.D. to the movie industry.

818
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:06,720
I mentioned this before, and I'm gonna say it again probably every week

819
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,720
until this movie comes out, and then after I see that movie,

820
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:15,880
just because I have to go make fun of it. Listen, this whole continuity thing, the fucking

821
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:22,880
movie The Core makes no fucking sense. Okay, okay, The Core. Here's The Core, basically

822
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:30,240
a brief summary. We developed this weapon to cause earthquakes to, you know, attack

823
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,560
people. Then, oh, somehow we stopped The Core from spinning, which causes weird electrical

824
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:38,560
storms and shit that destroys the world, and we have to jump start The Core. Well, how

825
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,160
How else do you think you'd jump to the core?

826
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,080
Oh well, let's design this vehicle to drill into the middle of the core, and everything's

827
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,920
solved with nuclear weapons, so why not detonate a nuclear bomb and hope that everything's

828
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,920
fine.

829
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,840
And then ride the giant shockwave with the molten lava that's gonna engulf the whole

830
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,840
thing and magically fly out through the surface of the earth and be fine.

831
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:01,240
While this magic guy who's played by DJ Qualls or whatever his name is, that stupid nerdy

832
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:06,760
guy from Road Trip, he's gonna hack the planet, cause he's the best hacker ever, he can hack

833
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,760
the planet.

834
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:14,240
going to hack the information coming out of the planet. Fucking stupid movie! Come on!

835
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:21,240
Seriously, movies like this get fucking budgets, yet awesome movies like fucking Bubba Hotep.

836
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:27,320
Bruce Campbell is an awesome Elvis in that movie, but Bubba Hotep can't fucking get picked

837
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:31,860
up by all these studios. We're getting stupid movies like that, another Chris Rock movie

838
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:37,080
where he's gonna try to run for president. You know, stupid, out of, you know, fish out

839
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:42,580
of water movies. I hate him. I hate him, and I wish you'd die. We need more midget, uh,

840
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:51,580
vampire movies. I have one, yeah. Midget porn. Fuck midget porn. Anyway, vampire midget porn.

841
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:57,020
Carpool of midgets! Uh, are you guys having a go? Is that why you're up and ready to go?

842
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:00,020
Did you want to do FUs really fast? I'll let you go first.

843
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:02,020
Did you want to do some FUs?

844
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:08,020
Alright, Mel B and Sharkscroll are having a get going pretty soon here, so I thought I'd let them step in and do some FUs of the week if they want.

845
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:15,020
Well, I'll make this one real short and sweet. Apparently I'm just not as passionate as these other people, but I do have an FUs of the week.

846
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:24,020
To those people who are totally anti-against this upcoming Pony campaign, I don't know if any of y'all heard of it, but I guess Pony wants to have Jenna Jameson of all people be their spokesperson model.

847
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:28,180
Now, and like, they're gonna put billboards and everything all around Snokel and all that stuff,

848
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:32,100
and there's just like this total, yeah, touching against it. I don't know why.

849
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:35,780
I mean, yeah, porn stars just get normal credibility like everyone else,

850
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,020
they wanna be real actors, they got feelings too.

851
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:39,620
Hell, I would.

852
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:44,820
I mean, I can see it right now. After that, sign Ron Jeremy, he can be up on TV.

853
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:47,460
You know, me and a pony have one thing in common.

854
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:48,600
Pah!

855
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:50,340
Whips him right out.

856
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,660
And then, of course, you know, it comes down right to the shoes.

857
00:59:52,660 --> 01:00:02,660
I don't know, personally, I just don't get mad at the world very much, just when people hate porn, you know?

858
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:40,660
Hopefully I'm not ruining what I should be doing this year, so this will be the last game I can see for a long time, so I've blown off two different games to come see you guys, so...

859
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:44,660
I can't do it this third time. I have to check.

860
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,660
Okay, good.

861
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:53,660
Moose are so near-sighted, but they often try to mate with cars.

862
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:57,660
Wow, I did not know that. Did you know that, Jamie?

863
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:02,100
God bless C.R.A.M. Go wash C.R.A.M.

864
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:05,580
and we need to call the C.R.A.M. We are gonna be on C.R.A.M. and we're gonna cover it for

865
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:07,140
Orange Lawn's radio. I can't wait.

866
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:10,900
They're gonna put us in a storefront and make us stay up for 24 hours. That's gonna be freakin' entertaining.

867
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,620
I could never do that because that would be like

868
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:18,220
reliving all of middle school, high school, and college.

869
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:21,500
That accounts for 10 years of my life.

870
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:25,060
I'm not going to relive that ever again.

871
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:32,060
The concept is this. It's a trivia show. They give you all the books, all the information

872
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:48,680
you need, and you have to stay up for 24 hours straight. You're not allowed to sleep. You're

873
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:53,460
in a storefront. People can see in. You can see them. I've seen people making faces and

874
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:56,220
doing entertaining things to the people outside.

875
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:59,700
You have to read all these books and all this information and remember it, and then they

876
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:03,980
quiz you on it when you get on the show and make you do entertaining things like stand

877
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:09,080
on balance beams and stuff, but mind you, you haven't slept in over 24 hours, so it's

878
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,820
pretty fun to watch these people.

879
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:14,460
Then at the end, if you actually make it and you're the winning team, they have this lovely

880
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:20,740
woman who will tuck you into a nice warm bed and put a nice black eye cover on you and

881
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:25,540
Read you facts, and she reads you facts in a voice like this.

882
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:30,660
Adolf Hitler and Mussolini both had venereal disease.

883
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:33,420
You are getting so sleepy.

884
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:36,940
And I'm just like, oh shit, I'd be gone.

885
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:39,340
And if you win, you have to answer five questions in a row,

886
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,180
right, and you get $10,000.

887
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:42,420
And I think we'd be fabulous.

888
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:44,220
Oh, I think Melody and I would take it all.

889
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,620
So we've got to get on there.

890
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:50,500
I think I would do OK at this, except that I don't want to.

891
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:57,140
Because, when I was in college, every time an exam would come up, I wouldn't sleep for

892
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,140
four days.

893
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:02,700
The most I stayed awake was five days in a row.

894
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:05,180
I worked during part of this.

895
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:09,900
I stayed up one night running D&D, actually two nights running D&D games while people

896
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,540
were studying.

897
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:16,680
And I took all of my exams, did not make less than a B on them.

898
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:20,140
The last day, after all my exams, I was sitting at my friend's house watching them on their

899
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:27,940
computer next thing I know I'm in my dorm room in bed sounds like a bad

900
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:34,980
sorority party I loved college anyway you know whenever there's an opportunity

901
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:41,100

902
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:44,000

moving on

921
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,560
All right, I have some FUs of the Week.

922
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:43,680
Let's see, my first FU of the Week

923
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,320
goes to

924
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,440
Irene,

925
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,240
because Irene was rooting against me today in Mario Party 4

926
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:55,720
because she was just pissed off that I whooped her ass last night at Mario Party 4.

927
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:59,140
So of course I won the game again, just to show you not to fuck with me in Mario

928
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:00,560
Party,

929
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,100
because I rule.

930
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,400
Anyway,

931
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,280

01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:09,600
my other if you the week goes to party girl last night because i'm not willing

to do that for peace

934
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,360
and i guess it's really a i guess that's all my

935
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,280
sadly enough

936
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,520
out you guys almost convinced me to go with you

937
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,440
really

938
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,200
almost

939
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:25,720
until the beach there is a good one and i thought the whole beat

940
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,640

941
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:31,980

guys before down and uh... sunday night at uh... the race

944
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:42,060

945
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:46,060
with their honestly does not free people

946
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:52,060

my other thank you

948
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,860
this is not reminded me of what i thought it

949
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:58,240
earlier today

950
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,860
thank you to everybody who

951
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:05,740
the word Mardi Gras is an excuse to throw a party because first of all Mardi Gras means

952
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:12,340
that Tuesday that's the day before Ash Wednesday right right okay Mardi Gras is

953
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:16,260
the real ones are held in Mobile which is where it started where I'm from Mobile

954
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:21,420
Alabama New Orleans which is you know basically crap Mardi Gras and then

955
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:25,540
fraternity and sorority girls to end up on girls gone wild yeah oh I forgot to

956
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:48,540
You know, actually, Guys Gone Wild was supposedly already out. I've been trying to get the video, but I've had it on Backward for two months, or Guys Going Crazy. I've had it on Backward for like two months now, and apparently the studio that we ordered it from is such a small studio that they won't be able to get it.

957
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:58,540
I've had it on backorder for like two months now, and I have apparently the studio that we ordered from is such a small studio that they won't take orders because we have so many titles on order.

958
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:07,540
And so I had another one also, Girls Going X, what was it? It was Girls Going XXX Wild, Extra Wild or something like that.

959
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:17,540
But the guy's going crazy from what I heard. It's just a bunch of like video of like guys getting head and stuff from like women and stuff, I think.

960
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:21,540
I want to see guys getting head from other guys.

961
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:25,340
Jamie don't hold back. Well, you know what? You know what? We can get you some...

962
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:28,940
I can try. I know that they have some of those Vivid DVDs.

963
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:33,540
I had one at one point in my possession. I think I ended up throwing it out when I moved.

964
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:36,540
But, um, we had one, it was like...

965
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:41,540
They had, like, a bunch of, you know, guy fucking scenes. They had one guy getting fucked by a machine type of thing.

966
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:46,540
I don't want a guy on Robot Jam.

967
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:51,540
I want to tell you about the site that I found by accident, Man Machine.

968
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:52,540
Accident, huh?

969
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:54,540
No, it's real.

970
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:57,540
Okay, I was looking at Bill Jenchi, but I found this one.

971
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:02,540
It was a link to this, and I think this site is down, I thought it was manmachine.com.

972
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:08,540
But it was these guys, like the first thing you see on this page is this guy attached to a machine

973
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:15,540
with like this

974
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:20,540
is that like the flashlight

975
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:25,180

976
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:27,700
i have my body a mardi gras

977
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:29,700

980
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:44,020
I would only show any of my body parts if there was a lot of money involved, and nobody else was there.

981
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:48,020
Turn off all the lights, give me a million dollars, and flash!

982
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:51,020
You know, flash in the night. There you go.

983
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:58,020
I'm glad you brought the show back to Bamani, because we've kind of forgotten our roots there for a minute.

984
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:00,020
Flash in the night, in the dark where no one can see.

985
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:05,160
Oh, yeah, yeah, cuz we got to finish the same now cuz it's already been going for about 40 minutes, so

986
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:09,080
Loving let's uh, let's start with the intern Ryan. What's up?

987
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,880
Shut up, I'm saying an F you

988
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,680
F you oh

989
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,120
no, like what I got is a

990
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:28,160
F used all the little kids and the one adult who decided it would be a good idea to run across the crosswalk on DDR

991
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:41,160
And for people who don't know what the crosswalk is, we gave it the name basically because there's the machine and a lot of places have that wood piece between the panels and the machine.

992
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:54,160
So kids decided to run across there over and over and over again. And we had an adult. Last night I was playing over at Scandia and some little kid got up on there when I was doing doubles and I knocked the kid four feet off the panel.

993
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,560
eke

994
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,060
uh... that's cool

995
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:01,640
as i said i feel really bad and he's all

996
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:04,080
no don't worry about it i told him not to go up there

997
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:07,560
so that guy gets the parenting award of the week

998
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:10,560
it was really cool

999
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,600
all right

1000
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:20,640

01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:53,540

1022
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:23,100
Here's my FU. My other FU of the week. This was a good one.

1023
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:27,100
A bunch of us were standing all around just outside of the party room by the 2DX machine.

1024
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:31,100
Myself, Jamie, Irene, Brad, and Keith, the Scandi of Tech.

1025
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:35,100
We were all sitting around outside the party room.

1026
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:38,620
kind of all standing there, and we're talking, da da da da da, you know, we're having a good

1027
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:41,180
time, and then all of a sudden I hear this voice behind me.

1028
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:43,180
Excuse me?

1029
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:47,380

1036
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:08,660

1037
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,500
means that the best thing

1038
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,980

I put my backpack down in our break room. I go in there when I get off to get it and my watch is gone.

1052
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:06,980
The only people allowed in the break room are employees.

01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:13,300

01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:26,460
all people

1069
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:29,100
the fear of cops

1070
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,960
fast turns

1071
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,640
shitty tires

1072
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:36,960
and stoplights, all that stuff. They're bad.

1073
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,760
Because I tried... Yeah.

1074
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:42,520
Okay, that's a lot of people.

1075
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:45,160
Hey, I'm not one of them. I'm not one of them. Okay.

1076
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,200
No, um...

1077
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:51,040
And, fuck you to not being able to turn fast enough, because, like, I was trying to go

1078
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,200
50 in a residential area,

1079
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:58,240
and the tires started squealing hella bad.

1080
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:02,440
I couldn't go 60.

1081
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:08,440
No, and so, um, that's basically it, and, and F.U. did not being able to see into Jamie's car,

1082
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:11,440
cause there's, the light didn't seem to be working or something.

1083
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:16,440
And so I just search around in the dark for like two minutes to try to find what I was looking for,

1084
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,440
and then how to lock the car, cause I couldn't figure it out.

1085
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:19,440
But that's it, okay Rob.

1086
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,440
Alright, Chat Room F.U.s, I'm gonna run through these.

1087
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:25,440

1088
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:58,320
I play we will rock you on step mania see nine feet then go to scandia own it and cross a cata off my list

1089
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,200
Fuck yeah, fuck you to international toll charges

1090
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:06,240
I cannot talk to my love girl and fuck you for making me accidentally calling DDR. Holic a kid

1091
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:08,240
There's my three. You don't like him. Fuck you

1092
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,840

Fuck you to myself for making like one of the hardest DW eyes ever because I'm an asshole I made

1094
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:24,280
I did a DWI to Hot Limit that is really impossible, so fuck you to myself.

1095
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:27,280
It makes no sense.

1096
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:30,280
And stop making bad remixes, please!

1097
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:35,280
Just because you know how to chop samples and put them next to each other, doesn't mean you know how to remix.

1098
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:39,280
Fuck you to this song because I just started doing the Samba de Amiga stuff to it.

1099
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:43,280
Dude, this song rules and you still need to give me my porn from like a long time ago.

Dude, my, dude, no, no, uh, Garret, no, SkylineDC505 needs...

1102
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,280
No, he didn't say that, he just, somebody else did, but it's funny.

1103
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:59,280
No, look up farther, look up farther, it says it, uh, he needs...

1104
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,280
Moving on, moving on.

1105
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:01,280
Anyway.

1106
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:07,280
DarkTetsuya, hello, DarkTetsuya says fuck the fact that girls don't want to talk to him.

1107
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,280
Aww, girls want to talk to you.

1108
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:13,280
Dark Tetsuya

1109
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,280
You bitch!

1110
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:18,280
I'm sorry. You know I'm teasing.

1111
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:20,280
I like dark Tetsuya.

1112
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:24,280
Uh, fuck the initial D machine at CCL for being broken again.

1113
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,280
What?

1114
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:30,280
You are so mean. Alright.

1115
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,280
You know some jokes.

1116
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,280
Soutome Ranma says, hey, I have-

1117
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:35,280
You pronounced it right.

1118
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,280
What?

1119
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,280
You pronounced it right.

1120
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:38,280
Holy shit.

1121
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,280
Rob pronounced something right in Japanese.

1122
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:46,280
God, my eyes are slanting as we speak, okay.

1123
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:51,480
Loki in the back's going, Rob, you're getting shorter.

1124
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:55,360
I only have one F-you, and it's to everyone that lies about their DDR

1125
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,520
accomplishments. Pisses me off.

1126
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:01,000
Everyone who lies about their DDR accomplishments.

1127
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:06,000
You mean like Triple-A and We Will Rock You? I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1128
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,200
uh...

1129
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:11,840
sorry about the whole more typing thing i'm sleepless all i have a second fuck

1130
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:15,560
you it's all these secret spy camera pop-ups

1131
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,300
that had a nearly a m

1132
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:19,680
but not nearly naked women

1133
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,280
as in they're not close

1134
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:24,600
nor naked but painfully in the middle

1135
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,940
go to jail is if you want to see food

1136
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:30,840
if you would be good things like this on the site that's not even a porn site

1137
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,080
just go to jaylist.com and look at the DVD section.

1138
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:35,320
Just go to Persian Kitty for Christ's sake.

1139
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,040
All those hidden camera sites, OK, the hidden camera things

1140
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:39,720
are for security only.

1141
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:43,440
So I never knew that I had naked models or close to naked models

1142
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:46,480
on my lawn, like hours of the day that I don't realize.

1143
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,800
But if I had a hidden camera, I would.

1144
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:49,300
I'm done.

1145
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:52,720
I actually do have one more fuck you, and that is to jaylist.com.

1146
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:57,280
I'm looking for a copy of Battle Royal on jaylist.com.

1147
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:00,280
Instead, I have to look through so many pictures of boobs and twat,

1148
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:05,280
Okay. If I want to see boobs and twat, I'll actually go looking for porn. For real porn.

1149
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:10,280
Alright. Uh, here's, okay, here's another one. Let's see if I get this right.

1150
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:13,280
Ninja Usagi Koi. Did I get that right?

1151
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,280
Close. Ninja Usagi Koi.

1152
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:25,280
Oh. Says, I want to send an F.U. to whoever broke the fan in our arcade. A big F.U. to our arcade manager for raising the price and not fixing the machine so it breaks for two weeks.

1153
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:30,280
When it does get fixed, have to dish out two dollars and die after the first round from the sheer ease.

1154
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:32,280
That is way too freakin' much for DDR.

1155
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,280
You must be playing at the Metreon or something.

1156
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:38,280
Yeah, at either the Metreon or at a convention or something.

1157
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,280
Okay, uh...

1158
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,280
Snugdismoid says,

1159
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:49,280
Fuck anyone that sees the magical invisible crosswalk of space between the DDR paths of the machine. I failed an Oni.

1160
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:55,280
Matchhead got fucked up and Zero accidentally ran into a kid just because people have a fascination with fucking us up.

1161
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:59,280
I don't care if I look stupid or if I suck, I just don't want to step on a kid. Or do I?

1162
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:02,280
That really sucked, too, because he was doing really good on the Oni.

1163
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:09,280
Then some stupid little girl walked in front of the screen. She didn't run, she took her sweet time and stood there like a friggin' moron.

1164
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,280
What you guys doing?

1165
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:18,280
We're going to have to take to the tactics that we used to have at RBGL, where people would stand on either side of the machine.

1166
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:26,280
That's actually what we started doing in the last half. Matchhead was there, and he was there, and I was there, and we were just standing on both sides of the machine.

1167
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:33,280
I think we should get, like, caution tape or something, and put it right there, and have the only way you can get in between the bars, because that would save a lot of trouble.

1168
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:42,280
I will give another Scandia shirt to somebody, and I'll just give it to everybody, and we can just stand on each side while they're wearing a Scandia shirt.

1169
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:44,280
With your arms folded, looking intimidating.

1170
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:45,280
Yeah, exactly.

1171
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:49,280
I didn't expect this to fix the machine. I don't remember how to...

1172
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:17,280
Hi, guys!

1173
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,280
Hi!

1174
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:19,280
DAS Square says,

1175
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:23,280
F you damn Cali bastards who get all the awesome Bhimani stuff,

1176
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:26,280
while we Easterners take it in the butt as far as Bhimani goes.

1177
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:29,280
I'm jealous of you lucky sons of bitches.

1178
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,280
Then move out here like I did.

1179
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:34,280
Hey, I gave up my life and got on a plane.

1180
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,280
Of course it was before there was Bhimani out here.

1181
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:41,280
But the East Coast has hurricanes and snow.

1182
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:44,280
And planes are going to skyscrapers.

1183
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:46,420
Paris

1184
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:51,280
lower gas prices though

1185
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,200
snow

1186
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,280
lots of snow

1187
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:59,420
at least we don't have to pay like twenty bucks just to get to the arcade

1188
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:05,000
but also keep in mind that food is taxed there

1189
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:11,440
alright moving on

1190
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,100
cancer off look you're off the hook tonight

1191
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:15,060
okay

1192
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:18,100
black lab says fuck the horrible dining hall food

1193
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:21,620
but the boring city of davis davis davis

1194
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:24,780
i was a danish republic of davis

1195
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:27,260
and fuck cheaters in online games

1196
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:28,460
and fuck boredom

1197
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:31,180
that was the purpose of online games

1198
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:34,020
yep but he's also part of staff so he's allowed

1199
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:38,060

01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:40,920
speed of light so i can get my customized cd quicker

1201
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:46,040
Fuck Sky for playing the not full version of Irresistible Mint.

1202
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,880
Fuck you too, I'll do what I want, bitch.

1203
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:51,380
FU to my mom for making me clean my room that's still messy.

1204
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:54,360
FU for making the FUs only three.

1205
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:57,760
And then he says play a song.

1206
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:01,640
The song I'm sending now is an excellent cover of I'm Like a Bird.

1207
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,920
I don't know, we might have to try that.

1208
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:07,260
Alright, we'll try that. We'll try that. We'll play that next break.

1209
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:17,260
OK, Vidpawa says, F you to dumb workers who can't properly put up a restaurant sign and have only 3 fourths of the letters light up while practically the rest of the entire mall has a perfectly lit up sign.

1210
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:24,260
Jay Kinetic, our favorite.

1211
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:34,260
Jay Kinetic says, fuck you to Stone Cold Steve Austin for coming back to the WWE. I can't watch Raw or is it SmackDown, the more suited show for Stone Cold?

1212
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:36,260
He got tired of beating his wife and now he has to beat on wrestlers.

1213
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:40,260
Hold on. For coming back, slapping your wife in anger is never okay.

1214
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:45,260
Fuck you to every scrub at Southland Mall tonight who couldn't play any song besides Orion 7-8.

1215
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:50,260
Dang, that's like a year ago. With Orion 7-8 getting played all the time.

1216
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:57,260
Fuck you to the guy who made pop-up porn. I don't give a shit about your sister getting ass raped violently by a horse while you shit on her face.

1217
01:24:57,260 --> 01:25:00,260
If I wanted prawn, I'd go to persiankitty.com.

1218
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:02,260
That's what I recommended earlier.

1219
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:15,260
Jkinetic also says, fuck you to bitch-ass roommates who don't do their dishes, I work 40 hours a week and I still have a way to work out, wash dishes, and bullshit on the internet. Fuck you to world discounters for some of the most ghetto, fake, crass, and bullshit stuff for high prices.

1220
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:25,260
An FU to HappyHackers.com for taking down their back door sections, so now I can't get free porn from them.

1221
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:28,260
And on that note, I think we finally exhausted the FUs of the week.

1222
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:29,260
I have a request.

1223
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:30,260
Oh, Jesus.

1224
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:31,260
No, no request for a song.

1225
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:32,260
Oh, what?

1226
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:34,260
And this is important.

1227
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:42,260
Later on, later this week, we have lost one of our most beloved childhood entertainers.

1228
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:48,260
Mr. Rogers died this week, so it was very sad.

1229
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:51,260
Do we have the Mr. Rogers theme? I think we should play it during the break.

1230
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:56,260
Let's see. Let's see if we have it. Let me look.

1231
01:25:56,260 --> 01:26:00,260
No, I do not have the Mr. Rogers theme, but if somebody in the chat room has the Mr. Rogers theme

1232
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:04,260
and wants to send it to me, that would be fabulous, and we'll play it later in the show.

1233
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:09,260
Okay. Okay, well, I'll sing it. Okay, here we go. Johnny will lead.

1234
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:13,260
okay I think I remember this I don't know the whole thing I know the first

1235
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:17,260
part okay let's just repeat the same thing over and over again. Ready?

1236
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:23,260
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood. A beautiful day in the neighborhood.

1237
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:27,260
Hahahaha

1238
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:31,260
Won't you be my name? Won't you be my...

1239
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:34,260
Won't you be my neighbor? Come on now!

1240
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:36,260
You were already fucking it up.

1241
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:38,260
It's a beautiful day for a neighborhood.

1242
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:40,260
The second part is a beautiful day for a neighborhood, would you be mine?

1243
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:42,260
Yeah, it's not a beautiful day for a neighborhood.

1244
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:44,260
And then could you be mine?

1245
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:46,260
All right, chat room, send it to us.

1246
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:48,260
Would you be mine?

1247
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:53,260
First of all, I have perfect pitch, and hearing this many people off key is giving me a headache again.

1248
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:57,260
If no one brings it, then I'll just bring it next time.

1249
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:59,260
Okay, all of you are now voluntary, so shut up.

1250
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:03,260
Before I beat you like voluntary.

1251
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:05,260
Okay

1252
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:13,380
One last comment one last comment before we go to break and as the chat room is saying we're disgracing the memory of a living

1253
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:18,340
Let's see

1254
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:23,880
Tell me Rama says hey look. It's me. I just wanted to comment that Battle Royale is the most traumatizing movie

1255
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:27,060
I've ever seen I recommend it wholeheartedly it made me cry

1256
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:31,740
I don't know how they based a movie on kids killing each other, but they did it, but you should buy it anyways

1257
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:37,800
Battle royal is actually and I found out more about this is basically was sent as a statement to Japanese children

1258
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:42,640
Because actually school violence has gotten to be at a pretty big high

1259
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:46,780
In Japan, so they made this to show the extreme side of violence in school

1260
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:52,580
Yeah, just like series 7 said Fe to the reality shows and after series 7 came out

1261
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:56,220
So did tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons of reality shows.

1262
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:59,700
So it didn't work. And they're making a second battle royale.

1263
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:01,220
Number two, coming up soon.

1264
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:02,980
I have the first one, and it was awesome.

1265
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:09,980
Especially the guy that goes around and kills everybody because he's awesome and he gets killed in the end.

1266
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:14,660
Jay Kinetic says we fucked up the Mr. Rogers song so bad it's as bad as George

1267
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:18,340
Bush not knowing the words to Jingle Bells.

1268
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:22,060
Strong Matt forgives the lyrics to his favorite songs.

1269
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:26,060
Okay, we're gonna go to a break. We're gonna play that song. JB says should be dedicated.

1270
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:32,060
JB says we should play and JB says should be dedicated to me. This is Sheldon with I'm Like a Bird, the dance remix.

1271
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:36,060
That loud popping noise was brought to you by Propel.

1272
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:37,060
Ow!

1273
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:39,060
Alright, we'll be back.

1274
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:10,060
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1275
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:27,060
Your people, that's for sure

1276
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:30,060
They'll never, ever fade

1277
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:34,060
You're lovely, but it's not for sure

1278
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:16,060
All I need for you to know is your faith in me

1279
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:18,060
It gives me disease

1280
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:21,060
Even after all these years

1281
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:25,060
And it pays me so much to tell

1282
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:29,060
That you don't know me that way

1283
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:06,060
I'm gonna say goodbye Just every time you try

1284
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:16,060
To tell me me that you love me Oh, oh, it's every single day

1285
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:22,060
I know I'm gonna have to eventually give you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1286
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:30,060
Don't my love be a chariot Don't my love be a shrew, yeah

1287
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:40,060
Hey, I'm just sayin', fell with me for a rule

1288
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:47,060
I'm not the brother, I only run away I don't know when my story will end

1289
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:50,400
They call me but slowly, but slowly're away

1290
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,300
I don't know where my story it away

1291
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:53,940
I don't know where my hope is

1292
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:57,700
They call me but slowly, but slowly're away

1293
01:31:57,700 --> 01:31:59,660
I don't know where my story at away

1294
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:01,360
I don't know where my hope is

1295
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:04,020
They call me but slowly, but slowly're away

1296
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:07,180
I don't know where my story at away

1297
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:09,180
I don't know how

1298
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:16,420
All right everybody, now thanks to Akuma GM, we have the real thing, so since you guys

1299
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:22,140
fucked it up so bad, myself included, sorry, here's your chance to study, so there will

1300
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:28,380
be a quiz later, so now in memorandum of a living saint, here you go, a moment of silence

1301
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:35,380
Please.

1302
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:06,420
It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood.

1303
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:12,220
A beautiful day for a neighbor, would you be mine?

1304
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:13,580
Could you be mine?

1305
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:15,540
It's a neighborly day in this beauty, would a neighborly day for a beauty?

1306
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:17,020
Would you be mine?

1307
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:20,200
Could you be mine?

1308
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:24,960
I have always wanted to have a neighbor, just like you.

1309
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:33,360
I've always wanted to live in the neighborhood with you so let's make the most of this beautiful day

1310
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:37,120
since we're together we might as well say

1311
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:42,640
could you be mine, could you be mine, won't you be my neighbor

1312
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:56,640
Can't you please, won't you please, please won't you be, my neighbor, my television neighbor.

1313
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:58,640
I'm glad we're together again.

1314
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:32,640
One day when I got hungry, I told them who to help

1315
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:36,640
I had to be Chef Uncle Ghandi, who let's think of who to help

1316
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:39,640
Uncle Ghandi, he is rich, he is the freshest kind of man

1317
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:43,640
And I know that he will help me, as much as he can

1318
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:46,640
The freshest kind of man is what I want to be

1319
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:50,640
But there's all of us who want to ride with me

1320
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:53,640
I don't know why it's okay that I'm always by

1321
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:57,280
But every speed in kazoo-ta is a fight

1322
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:00,640
Kazoo-ta, I am a sexy-cyber

1323
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:04,240
Kazoo-ta, I play my little sexy

1324
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:07,640
Kazoo-ta, sexy sexy sexy

1325
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:09,640
And I won't stop

1326
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:12,640
When the texture comes flying

1327
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:26,640
I love to fly the klaxy

1328
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:28,640
I like it very much

1329
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:30,640
Even though I have relations

1330
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:31,640
I always panic, but

1331
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:33,640
I can't buy me off my hands

1332
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:35,640
I can't buy me a copy

1333
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:08,500
I am the sexy clown of Mayen

1334
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:12,060
I am the sexy clown of Mayen

1335
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:17,640
Cali cali gutta guta guta yo yo

1336
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:24,360

1339
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:14,960
I am a taxi driver's man I am a taxi driver's man

1340
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:18,960
I am a taxi driver's man

1341
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:30,960
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio

1342
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:35,960
Hi, we're back. I have food in my mouth.

1343
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:38,960
I'm eating these combos.

1344
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:39,960
Everybody left.

1345
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:42,960
I haven't had combos in a long time.

1346
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,960
And I swear to God, this is some of the most addicting shit in the world.

1347
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:47,960
You know what's more addicting than those to me?

1348
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:49,960
Actually, when I was in middle school, do you know what the snack was?

1349
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:50,960
What?

1350
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:53,960
The Everlasting Gobstopper.

1351
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:56,960
No, but we used to take them out to see what color they changed.

1352
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:58,960
That was the coolest.

1353
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:05,960
And you know what, I love all of you from Starman.net because I want Mother64 to come

1354
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:06,960
out.

1355
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:09,680
I was just about to say, we have all these new people in the chat room tonight, I was

1356
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:12,240
trying to figure out where the hell they were all from.

1357
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:17,880
And then I looked and somebody mentioned a site that they were all from, Starman.net.

1358
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:20,120
And then it's like, oh my god, it's an Earthbound site.

1359
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:21,880
I love Earthbound.

1360
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:25,200
Like seriously, I almost love Earthbound more than I do DDR.

1361
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:26,280
Earthbound was the shit.

1362
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:27,280
You know what?

1363
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:31,560
By the way, for people who actually have emulators, I've heard this, because I know that the guy

1364
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:37,960
who did Robotech Crystal Dreams has as much as a game that they had programmed out in

1365
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:39,920
ROM format for these emulators.

1366
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:46,220
I have been hearing that there was a prototype ROM for Mother 64, and I've been looking for

1367
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:47,220
it.

1368
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:49,340
So if any of you have it, please feel free to send it to me.

1369
01:39:49,340 --> 01:39:53,880
They have a little section here on EB64, let me click, I'm clicking here, that they were

1370
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:59,160
We're going to plan a sequel and there's little cute little screenshots.

1371
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:00,640
Why the hell didn't this come out?

1372
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,840
F Nintendo.

1373
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:03,520
Why aren't we getting one of these on GameCube?

1374
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:08,640
See, you know what frustrated me is every time I started Earthbound, someone would interrupt

1375
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:12,360
me when I was playing my game and I've never gotten to get further than the first town.

1376
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:13,360
You know what?

1377
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:17,680
No, I never got further than like, Foresight I think was like the furthest I got.

1378
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:20,160
I hope I didn't fuck that name up or I'm going to really get shooed out now that all the

1379
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:24,840
fanboys are in there but you know that's I think the furthest I ever got and I

1380
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:31,200
never did get to be that but really that's cool now that's that was the shit

1381
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:35,840
when Ness was ended up being in Smash Brothers because I own with Ness and

1382
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:42,280
Smash Brothers all you have to do is sit there and you just PK fire the shit out

1383
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:47,800
of everybody which reminds me they're having a sale on Super Smash Brothers

1384
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:54,900
right now for like 29 bucks at fries I'm so excited this oh guess what they sent

1385
01:40:54,900 --> 01:41:00,780
us the biggest joke in the universe for free what a request for ps2 see that's a

1386
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:05,980
great thing about like my man managing GameStop because we get free crap games

1387
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:11,920
for free like we got we got BMX triple X for free and then they sent us ever

1388
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:16,920
I want to borrow a PMX Triple X from YouTube.

1389
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:21,920
Can I borrow a PMX Triple X?

1390
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:31,920
Can I borrow a PMX Triple X?

1391
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:36,920
I'll buy it.

1392
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:15,840
it's cool actually no unless you've been going playing the demo at GameStop

1393
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:20,600
but no it's actually I thought that I was gonna I see I was still feeling you

1394
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:25,220
know a little bit weird about that game just because link looks like a dork but

1395
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:30,660
when you see the game in action it's so freaking cool and like you're in the

1396
01:42:30,660 --> 01:42:35,120
dungeon and the you know to cross like the lava you throw bottles of water at

1397
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:39,960
the lava, and it cools it. And you can ride them up jets of lava, it's so cool.

1398
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:42,800
I was telling you about Dark Cloud earlier, that was another thing I was cool about, is

1399
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:46,240
all the dungeons are randomly generated throughout the game.

1400
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:55,240
Of course, right now I'm still trying to go back and finish Final Fantasy X, because I

1401
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:58,880
have this habit with any Final Fantasy game that I rush all the way through it just because

1402
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:07,400
I play really smart when I play. Now I'm at the first Unileska battle, and well, you know,

1403
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:13,800
Auron is at 4,000 hit points, Tidus is at 2,100. And you know what? That's way too little.

1404
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:15,960
I'm supposed to be like, what, 6,000 hit points by now.

1405
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:20,080
No, no, I never got that far in 10. As long as you have haste, Dega, you're all

1406
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:25,040
good to go. Uh-uh, not yet. I only have haste. I'm slow

1407
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,240
right now. Big news in the video game community this

1408
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:30,040
this week, and Jamie, I think you're the only one that's played it. Maybe anybody else who's

1409
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:33,120
played it wants to chime in. Xenosaga?

1410
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:39,320
I saw Xenosaga last year at March Madness, come to think of it, when I was staying at

1411
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:47,500
Tyzone. I saw the incredibly long cinematic intro to Xenosaga, and I was absolutely uninterested

1412
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:51,280
in it. I thought it was pretty, but I'd never played Xenogears, so Xenosaga means nothing

1413
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:52,280
to me.

1414
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:53,280
Xenogears rocked.

1415
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:56,000
Xenosaga's nothing like Xenogears, though.

1416
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:04,280
Another big news is uh Konami changed their logo and they lost their stupid little red

1417
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:07,040
yellow flag.

1418
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:10,280
It was cool like the little walkie guy was cool.

1419
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:15,960
It was like at the beginning of Dracula X2 also known in the US and none of us who ever

1420
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:20,280
had the game in the US knows about this for Castlevania Symphony of the Night for the

1421
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:24,480
Japanese one the Japanese Konami logo the two little squiggly lines walk across the

1422
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:26,480
The screamer goes doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

1423
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:29,480
That was also the salmon in BeatMania II also.

1424
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:30,480
Yeah.

1425
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:31,480
That's where I saw it.

1426
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:32,480
I thought it was a cool thing.

1427
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:36,040
And actually a little Beymani reference to this.

1428
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:39,120
The song, what was it?

1429
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:40,120
Make a Jam?

1430
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:41,120
Mm-hmm.

1431
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:45,520
The effects in that song are taken from the little walking Konami logo thing.

1432
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:46,520
That's cool.

1433
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:47,520
Yeah.

1434
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:51,200
Like, Konami's new logo is about as exciting as Namco's logo.

1435
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:54,520
Okay, Namco all by itself is cool because of Pac-Man.

1436
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:57,640
I know, but the logo is so boring.

1437
01:44:57,640 --> 01:45:01,760
Um, Konami's new logo is about as exciting as watching cheese ferment.

1438
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:05,640
It's about as exciting as the, uh, Jaguar.

1439
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:09,120
It's about as exciting as this radio program.

1440
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:13,720
Virtual Boy! Okay, Virtual Boy is more exciting than the new Konami logo.

1441
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:17,560
Because, at least, because, because, okay,

1442
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:22,560
The Virtual Boy gives me a headache. The New Konami logo makes me want to throw up.

1443
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:38,560
In other news, Poppin' Music 9 came out and it's cool. Poppin' Music Best Hits also is out with brand new V-Rare CD number 4, which is also cool.

1444
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:50,560
The absolute guitar version is supposed to be on new popin' music and also there's some new Desero songs. Desero being the person that the die can tie.

1445
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:54,560
I did get the long version of that rock version of absolute so we'll play that next break.

1446
01:45:54,560 --> 01:46:06,560
Oh, yeah. Okay, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air.

1447
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:17,560
Can somebody download the Desro songs and, like, set me up with them? Because all I have is Die Can Guy and I want to hear more stuff by them. But I can't download thirty megabytes on a 56K.

1448
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:18,560
Let me know where and I'll do it.

1449
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:19,560
Yeah.

1450
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:31,560
Yeah. They've been putting them on B Mani style. There's one up right now for here I think it is or whatever. They're my favorite now for some stupid reason. I'm their fanboy now.

1451
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:41,560
I want more Deval. As in more dancer. We had crumpling noises. What the hell was that?

1452
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:49,560
I keep moving the fucking cord over goddamn food that's in the middle here because it's about to tip over, and so I just move the food instead, you know.

1453
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:51,560
Being proactive.

1454
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:52,560
NES for president.

1455
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:54,560
NES for president.

1456
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:58,560
You poor deprived child.

1457
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:01,340
dude whatever happened to that guy

1458
01:47:01,340 --> 01:47:05,640
whatever happened to the guy that used to be in the Nintendo

1459
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:08,920
show that guy

1460
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:12,480
the Nintendo show the guy at the zapper

1461
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:15,600
Captain N. Captain N? Whatever happened to him? I downloaded

1462
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:18,680
the episode of Captain N where he went to the Zelda universe

1463
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:22,220
and it had Link and Zelda but they were like much taller

1464
01:47:22,220 --> 01:47:25,240
and but it was the same voices that was cool

1465
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:28,400
but the episode sucks because I cannot go back and watch Captain N

1466
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:39,400
Now that I know so much more about the background stories of these characters, because Simon Belmont, okay, they had him as being this pretentious asshole, when he was really supposed to be all honorable. I'm a vampire hunter, and I'm a Belmont, and damn, I'm cool.

1467
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:41,400
Fuck that, dude. You know what's going to be awesome? Is that fucking movie.

1468
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:42,400
Mega High, by the way.

1469
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:45,400
Van Helsing, the movie. It's going to be awesome.

1470
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:46,400
Ooh.

1471
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:54,400
Like, wasn't, the Captain N, didn't they play that during that horrible show where they, like, they'd have the two people compete in video game contests?

1472
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:56,400
No, Captain N was its own show.

1473
01:47:56,400 --> 01:48:00,400
Oh, because I remember they had a show where they would do some of that.

1474
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:04,400
And Captain N was even okay for a while, but they jumped the shark when they introduced Game Boy.

1475
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:05,400
Oh my God.

1476
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:08,400
As a person.

1477
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:13,400
No, it was a Game Boy, and they would ride the Game Boy like a flying carpet.

1478
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:17,400
And Mega Man would always talk Mega High, and Kid Icarus was stupid.

1479
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:18,400
That was pretty bad.

1480
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:22,400
They'd have Pit there, and he'd be like, hi, I'm Kid Icarus, but I'm not Pit.

1481
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:27,460
john fields when it's blood captain in dot net

1482
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:28,980
did i'm gonna go to that site

1483
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:33,400
okay i think there is to do the cage match now

1484
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:36,780
that's game you know i don't think i remember that from the eighties

1485
01:48:36,780 --> 01:48:38,360
kid video

1486
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:40,440
freaking kid video was the best

1487
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:43,000
you know what i haven't understood one topic

1488
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,040
that like discussed as you a baby

1489
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:47,960
the whole night

1490
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:50,040
jay kinetic actually says here he says

1491
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:56,040
He married Kid Video. That's what happened to Captain Eddie. He married Kid Video. They live in the cast store now and run a small book store.

1492
01:48:56,040 --> 01:49:01,040
Kid Video was the name of the band.

1493
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:06,040
Maybe he married the whole band. I don't know.

1494
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:11,040
See, I remember the intro to that song. Yeah, I agree. Let's get to the cage, man.

1495
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:16,040
And they would play, you know, horrible 80's videos afterwards.

1496
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:22,640
do not play track 1 or 2, do not play track 2. It will blow out your speakers. One of

1497
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:34,280
the tracks will show up as the game. You want to know what's really cool is if you put in

1498
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:38,840
the Japanese version of the Dracula X2 and then put in Castlevania of the Night. He actually

1499
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:42,680
says exactly the same thing, just one's in English and the other. They did a perfect

1500
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:46,680
There is no track 14.

1501
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:47,680
Is it the last track?

1502
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:48,680
It's the last track.

1503
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:50,680
So there's a track 13.

1504
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:51,680
Whatever.

1505
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:52,680
Okay.

1506
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:53,680
We'll try that.

1507
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:55,560
It shows up as track 14 on mine.

1508
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:58,960
If it ain't it, then I'll just get bitch slapped and we'll see.

1509
01:49:58,960 --> 01:49:59,960
That's right.

1510
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:01,120
Track 13 plus a data track.

1511
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:02,120
So track 14.

1512
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:03,120
Alright.

1513
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:04,120
Okay.

1514
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:05,120
Okay.

1515
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:06,120
We got that settled now.

1516
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:07,120
Good.

1517
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:08,520
Then let's get it on.

1518
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:10,680
The cage match, everybody.

1519
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:11,680
Hooray.

1520
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:15,680
Rob, did I get to play live at the K-Trap song?

1521
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:18,680
I have a really good one.

1522
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:35,680
No, I'm too lazy to get there.

1523
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:39,680
But I've been to this one before. Where's your house?

1524
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:41,680
Tell people on, tell people.

1525
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:15,480
The Chat Room has some weird taste sometimes, but no, this is actually a pretty good song.

1526
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:16,760
This is a good one to win.

1527
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:19,200
But man, against, come on, Legend of Trance?

1528
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:20,200
I thought for sure that would win.

1529
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:24,520
And then we had the Love of the Angel, I thought the Dedication would have votes built into

1530
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:28,880
it, but apparently the Chat Room had other ideas in mind because this is the winner.

1531
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:32,160
This is Wild Side with Heaven is a Place on Earth, and this is the first song you can

1532
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:34,800
vote for in tonight's cage match, the reigning champion.

1533
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:41,800
Here's a clip.

1534
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:31,120
All right, that's the first song you can vote for is Wild Side with Heaven is a Place on

1535
01:52:31,120 --> 01:52:32,120
Earth.

1536
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:34,640
way the cage match works by the way for those of you who are kind of new to our

1537
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:39,100
chat room in the show we're gonna play three songs first off we play a clip of

1538
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:42,500
last week's winner then we'll play two full-length songs two new songs that are

1539
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:47,540
chosen by the hosts and you guys vote on your favorite and the winner goes into

1540
01:52:47,540 --> 01:52:51,740
rotation on Orange Lounge Radio's music show that plays all week long when we're

1541
01:52:51,740 --> 01:52:56,100
not here with all your favorite DDR 2DX dance medium music and the cage match

1542
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:59,960
winner so that being said you can't submit your votes till the end of the

1543
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:03,280
third song though so don't send him yet because we've got two more to go

1544
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:09,420
including Loki's Choice. Loki, what'd you pick for us tonight? Tonight we have one

1545
01:53:09,420 --> 01:53:15,680
of the, well, one of my most favorite Grant songs. This is Sasha with his very

1546
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:21,280
I think pretty famous expander. All right and let me know if this is the wrong one

1547
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:23,680
on X-Tickles. We're kind of trying to pull this from CD. This might be the wrong

1548
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:30,680
track. Here we go. This is Sasha with Expander, Loki's pick.

1549
01:57:23,680 --> 01:57:30,680
Sasha

1550
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:37,920
Alright, that was Sasha with Expander. That was

1551
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:41,920
Loki's pick for tonight's cage match. Let's go around the room and get our thoughts on it. Jamie?

1552
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:45,920
Repetitive, but nice. I give seven and a half.

1553
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:50,920
Seven and a half. Johnny?

1554
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:57,920
you're eating are all come back to you johnnie

1555
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,480
i give it

1556
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:09,560
any reason why

1557
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:13,000
i wasn't really listening and i don't know that are good

1558
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,760
but i'll let you judgment

1559
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:20,080
i say and i agree with him he was a little bit repetitive i give it a seven

1560
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:24,080
I'll go around the majority and pick the average. I'm going to say 7.

1561
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:25,080
Alright.

1562
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:27,080
Yeah, it was.

1563
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:31,080
Okay, so that's two down, one more to go.

1564
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:35,080
This is the last pick for tonight's cage match. This is a song I download.

1565
01:58:35,080 --> 01:58:39,080
Actually, Billy, the guy that was here earlier, Billy the big homo who told us the Mardi Gras story,

1566
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:43,080
suggested I download this song, and it ain't too bad, and I could totally see it in DDR.

1567
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:46,080
So I thought you guys might enjoy it.

1568
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:47,080
Excuse me.

1569
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:50,080
Is this? No, I should put Kylie Minogue in though, huh?

1570
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:53,080
You know what? Fuck that. Fuck this pic.

1571
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:57,080
I've changed my mind. I have done a last minute change my mind pic.

1572
01:58:57,080 --> 01:58:59,080
I want Kylie in the cage match.

1573
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:00,080
I know something I want to hear.

1574
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:03,080
So, my pick for tonight's cage match.

1575
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:05,080
God, I hope I can find it. Hold on, I gotta...

1576
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:09,080
No, no, no. It's a different one. It's really fucked up.

1577
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:11,080
But I'm kind of going really random.

1578
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:13,080
Kylie, I need you dirty.

1579
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:15,080
Okay, this is my pick.

1580
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:17,560
I downloaded something for Billy and I forgot to bring it.

1581
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:20,320
I got the lingerie commercial to download.

1582
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:23,400
I downloaded it for Billy and I didn't give it to him.

1583
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:26,600
You know, okay, I'm being told that I don't get it, that that track is one of the

1584
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:29,600
mainstays of trans and all that. It's been around for eight years.

1585
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:32,920
So what? It's still repetitive, that's my opinion. Eight years is old.

1586
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:35,800
Eight years is old.

1587
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:39,440
Okay, I changed my mind. This is my pick instead, because I want to get really random.

1588
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:42,520
The other one was too mainstream. This is Kylie Minogue

1589
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:46,920
with a song that Robbie Williams helped her co-write and it's really messed up

1590
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:51,440
and the video's cool and it looks like Xanadu, it really does, that's what Billie told me

1591
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:58,440
This is called Your Disco Needs You, and this is my pick for tonight's cage match, enjoy.

1592
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:31,840
Your disco, your disco, your disco, disco, disco, disco, disco

1593
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:37,840
Desperate, be seeking someone, willing to travel

1594
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:44,840
You're lost in conversation, at your best last revel

1595

and you know

1638
02:05:18,620 --> 02:05:22,820
but that would be

1639
02:05:22,820 --> 02:05:24,560
yeah i'd like to think it is a good

1640
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:25,540

1647
02:05:43,340 --> 02:05:46,500
that uh...

1648
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:49,140
if you don't like so that's that

1649
02:05:49,140 --> 02:05:52,060
yeah but i give it to you right

1650
02:05:52,060 --> 02:05:54,780
i give it a night to write it

1651
02:05:54,780 --> 02:05:56,220
all you don't know the music

1652
02:05:56,220 --> 02:06:01,220
moving on yeah well that's all i'm hearing and yeah

1653
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:05,780
can just check on that i love the 80s thing on vh1

1654
02:06:05,780 --> 02:06:07,260
that was so

1655
02:06:07,260 --> 02:06:10,620
the last thing i remember her in was that stupid movie where she got high high

1656
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:14,880
high page match kylie disco

1657
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:19,200
i lost interest in that song in like the first ten seconds

1658
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:26,200
if i could give it negative i would but i'll just say like one

1659
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:31,960
we were holding a whole conversation here in that song

1660
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:33,600
we started off talking about like

1661
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:34,860
the dreamcast stuff

1662
02:06:34,860 --> 02:06:37,540
yeah we were talking about dreamcast and zibriven

1663
02:06:37,540 --> 02:06:40,480
that's how bad that song was i give it a one

1664
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:43,240
uh... whatever whatever

1665
02:06:43,240 --> 02:06:44,440
i'm gonna retract

1666
02:06:44,440 --> 02:06:45,640
a ten

1667
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:49,640
I'm gonna retract mine and give it a half a point.

1668
02:06:49,640 --> 02:06:52,640
I give it a 30 then! Compensate!

1669
02:06:52,640 --> 02:06:54,640
Alright, alright.

1670
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:56,640
You know what?

1671
02:06:56,640 --> 02:06:58,640
I'm gonna give you the wafer.

1672
02:06:58,640 --> 02:07:01,640
Okay.

1673
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:07,640
That song, you guys, just, you don't understand quirky music.

1674
02:07:07,640 --> 02:07:09,640
You guys just don't understand quirky music. That's what it is.

1675
02:07:09,640 --> 02:07:11,640
I understand it!

1676
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:12,640
Rob?

1677
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:14,640
Olé, olé, olé!

1678
02:07:14,640 --> 02:07:20,640
I understand quirky music, and that wasn't quirky, that was vomiting.

1679
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:23,640
I give it a 10, because Kylie Minogue owns all of you.

1680
02:07:23,640 --> 02:07:26,640
Alright, so let's review. Here's what you can vote for tonight.

1687
02:08:07,400 --> 02:08:12,400
So, alright, we got a good chunk of time left in the show.

1688
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:17,400
What are you talking about here?

1689
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:22,400
Okay, alright.

1690
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:27,400
Yo, yo, I go to McDonald's.

1691
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:39,960
I should check the email box to see if we have any new messages here.

1692
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:43,880
We have dead air here.

1693
02:08:43,880 --> 02:08:46,320
The cheat is grounded.

1694
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:49,880
We had the light switch installed so you could turn the lights on and off.

1695
02:08:49,880 --> 02:08:55,920
Not so you could throw light switch waves.

1696
02:08:55,920 --> 02:09:00,240
We actually did have this big Homestar Runner fest over the weekend while Mel and Melody

1697
02:09:00,240 --> 02:09:01,240
were at my house.

1698
02:09:01,240 --> 02:09:05,200
Yeah, I sat down on that site for like 45 minutes, just going over the stuff.

1699
02:09:05,200 --> 02:09:06,200
My favorite one was-

1700
02:09:06,200 --> 02:09:08,200
I'm freaking Carmen Miranda!

1701
02:09:08,200 --> 02:09:15,160
My favorite one was to the guy with the long name, to the song, and he said, for how long

1702
02:09:15,160 --> 02:09:18,760
it took me to say your name, I could have painted a picture, and he goes out in the

1703
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:21,520
backyard and starts painting a picture, and he's all, this looks good, like put it in

1704
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:24,120
the art gallery or painting for some guy's dad.

1705
02:09:24,120 --> 02:09:29,680
I don't know that a lot of people haven't got this particular section of homestarrunner.com

1706
02:09:29,680 --> 02:09:32,180
the marzipan's answering machine. Yeah I did.

1707
02:09:32,180 --> 02:09:36,660
But I haven't talked to a lot of people who have. I went, like, there's a third thing I did.

1708
02:09:36,660 --> 02:09:38,280
This call is...

1709
02:09:38,280 --> 02:09:40,180
This call is not

1710
02:09:40,180 --> 02:09:42,740
your boyfriend.

1711
02:09:42,740 --> 02:09:47,660
That was the coolest thing ever. I actually sent an email. You have been diagnosed

1712
02:09:47,660 --> 02:09:53,880
with serious problems. I sent Strong Bad an email. Leave your stereo on the front porch.

1713
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:56,520
Yeah, that's what he had to cut back later or something.

1714
02:09:56,520 --> 02:10:00,480
Yeah, I sent one to Strong- I sent an email to Strong Bad. It was one that's saying if you were-

1715
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:03,880
There's something RPG about you, what would your character be?

1716
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:08,520
That'd just be interesting to see what he says to that one. You know what, though? That actually brings up a point.

1717
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:13,740
If you were suddenly list to the worlds of Dungeons and Dragons, what would your character class be?

1718
02:10:13,740 --> 02:10:16,320
My character would be like...

1719
02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:17,800
Some retard-

1720
02:10:17,800 --> 02:10:20,800
I would be some, like, retarded wizard, like, orc from He-Man.

1721
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:22,800
No, would you be, like, a wild mage then?

1722
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:23,800
Yeah.

1723
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:25,800
Wild mages are cool.

1724
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:28,800
What about you? What would your character class be?

1725
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:30,800
I was an evil jester last time I played.

1726
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:31,800
An evil jester?

1727
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:36,800
An evil jester who had playing cards that turned people into stuff, like jackasses.

1728
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:37,800
That's cool.

1729
02:10:37,800 --> 02:10:41,800
Yeah, if you were suddenly list to the worlds of Dungeons and Dragons, what would your character class be?

1730
02:10:41,800 --> 02:10:43,800
You know what? I never played it, so...

1731
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:45,800
Lesbian.

1732
02:10:45,800 --> 02:10:47,980
lesbian is not a character class

1733
02:10:47,980 --> 02:10:50,980
although i played a lesbian ninja once

1734
02:10:50,980 --> 02:10:52,940
the one time i played D&D

1735
02:10:52,940 --> 02:10:56,620
i was a lesbian

1736
02:10:56,620 --> 02:10:59,160
i want to play a lesbian ninja

1737
02:10:59,160 --> 02:11:01,760
oh wait wait i'm sorry i was a beautiful lesbian

1738
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:05,760
isn't D&D like that game where you just kind of make up shit and be like hey what's up

1739
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:08,280
we all switched to it and never got into D&D either

1740
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:10,880
i was probably D&D

1741
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:12,320
cool

1742
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:17,200
Like yeah, I'm Tigger. I can play any song just describe what your person would do

1743
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:19,960
my person

1744
02:11:19,960 --> 02:11:25,040
He wouldn't do much like do they have like magicians or whatever. There's wizards clerics

1745
02:11:25,880 --> 02:11:32,280
Wait major wizard. This is good. This is good. Loki's got a good idea here or there was zero that had the idea intern

1746
02:11:32,280 --> 02:11:33,760
I don't know. I guess back in there

1747
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:36,520
They were kind of thinking is we should do this live on Eris to segment four

1748
02:11:36,520 --> 02:11:39,880
So we're desperate were coming up for new segments because you know, we can only there's only

1749
02:11:39,880 --> 02:11:44,200
after some time we're gonna have done every listless topic we can possibly do

1750
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:53,640
so thinking of starting a D&D DDR game and we can play live on air DDR D&D you

1751
02:11:53,640 --> 02:11:58,480
know what actually actually no I'll tell you what let me sit down with freaking

1752
02:11:58,480 --> 02:12:02,840
white white wolf rules and I can make up the Pokemon style you know like in the

1753
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:39,840
Just bring in Mario Party and listen to us play that live on air. That would be great.

1754
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:42,840
Should have heard me earlier today. I choked Irene.

1755
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:46,840
She was being mean to me.

1756
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:57,840
We need to seriously get enough bandwidth to do a video feed because then what you could do is you could do a picture of what's on the TV as a video feed and hear us talking over it.

1757
02:12:57,840 --> 02:13:08,480
I used to sit and play D&D with my friends and I would always wear my black cloak over

1758
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:09,480
my head.

1759
02:13:09,480 --> 02:13:14,240
So you'd see this like, see me huddled over with a black cloak over me and all of a sudden

1760
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:17,160
this hand would creep out, throwing dice and then go back and write something down.

1761
02:13:17,160 --> 02:13:21,240
That would be fun to have a Super Smash Brothers tournament and have people watch us go on

1762
02:13:21,240 --> 02:13:22,240
about that forever.

1763
02:13:22,240 --> 02:13:24,200
I would win all of it.

1764
02:13:24,200 --> 02:13:25,960
Two characters.

1765
02:13:25,960 --> 02:13:27,060
adult link

1766
02:13:27,060 --> 02:13:33,300
adult link

1767
02:13:33,300 --> 02:13:36,840
i would be necessary

1768
02:13:36,840 --> 02:13:38,900
come you know you know if you have to do with the back

1769
02:13:38,900 --> 02:13:40,420
that's how i guess

1770
02:13:40,420 --> 02:13:42,780
i have another kid i'm actually really good with a bunch of characters on that

1771
02:13:42,780 --> 02:13:44,180
one of the other good one

1772
02:13:44,180 --> 02:13:47,740
who is my best one from the and sixty four one was kirby

1773
02:13:47,740 --> 02:13:49,040
kirby will never die

1774
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:51,800
you know we should do is have the home under contest

1775
02:13:51,800 --> 02:13:53,700
if you can get the first

1776
02:13:53,700 --> 02:13:57,020
Home Run Derby on Rival Schools.

1777
02:13:57,020 --> 02:14:02,020
You know, I can't play that game. I care if we get damn big.

1778
02:14:02,020 --> 02:14:05,900
Okay. We actually, you know what, on another show, play DDR Live on Netcam. It's actually

1779
02:14:05,900 --> 02:14:07,420
funny. The show that kind of

1780
02:14:07,420 --> 02:14:11,300
preceded this, I guess some would consider Orange Lounge a spin-off of

1781
02:14:11,300 --> 02:14:15,140
understudationlive.org. Which still plays Saturday nights. Which still does play on Saturday nights,

1782
02:14:15,140 --> 02:14:18,740
6.30 to 9.30, Pacific Standard Time, over to understudationlive.org.

1783
02:14:18,740 --> 02:14:21,300
We actually did do a DDR show, which was kind of

1784
02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:24,900
where this all came from, kind of, Orange Lounge actually kind of was birthed by that

1785
02:14:24,900 --> 02:14:29,900
show. I was a guest more times than anybody. And we did play DDR Live on air and we had

1786
02:14:29,900 --> 02:14:35,020
the cam and everything, it was pretty crazy. Who was around for that? I don't know if anybody

1787
02:14:35,020 --> 02:14:39,980
is listening to Orange Lounge was around for that show, who knows. Ask, oh, we have...

1788
02:14:39,980 --> 02:14:43,460
That was Orange Lounge in the fetal stage. Black Lab, save your question, we're gonna

1789
02:14:43,460 --> 02:14:46,780
do Ask Orange Lounge when we come back from the break, cause we have some new people listening

1790
02:14:46,780 --> 02:14:52,060
You want some more points? Let's take a quick break because I want to get the cage match

1791
02:14:52,060 --> 02:14:54,940
finished up so I'm going to give people a chance to send in the last votes. We're just

1792
02:14:54,940 --> 02:14:58,340
going to do a one song break because this is a five minute song but JB's been begging

1793
02:14:58,340 --> 02:15:03,680
and begging me to play this so fine. This is the sign with words, the dance mix, so

1794
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:08,140
I don't know what it's like, we'll hear it live on air. If it sucks, blame JB. Oh yeah

1795
02:15:08,140 --> 02:15:11,680
we've got to get to the absolute. Well we'll do absolute before the end of the show I promise.

1796
02:15:11,680 --> 02:15:17,880
the absolute guitar mix. We'll do that. So this is the last chance to get in your votes

1797
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:21,380
for the cage match. If you haven't voted, you have 60 more seconds and then voting is

1798
02:15:21,380 --> 02:15:28,380
closed or you die. So, we will be back. Enjoy.

1799
02:15:51,380 --> 02:15:53,380
Wait

1800
02:15:57,380 --> 02:15:58,380
C'mon

1801
02:16:05,380 --> 02:16:06,380
Wait

1802
02:16:12,380 --> 02:16:13,380
Wait

1803
02:16:14,380 --> 02:16:17,380
Don't come easy to me

1804
02:16:17,380 --> 02:16:23,380
How can I find a way to make you see?

1805
02:16:23,380 --> 02:16:28,380
I love you, birds don't come easy

1806
02:16:28,380 --> 02:16:31,380
Birds

1807
02:16:31,380 --> 02:16:35,380
Don't come easy to me

1808
02:16:35,380 --> 02:16:40,380
This is your only way for me to say

1809
02:16:40,380 --> 02:16:45,380
I love you, birds don't come easy

1810
02:16:45,380 --> 02:16:49,380
Why don't you start music playing?

1811
02:16:49,380 --> 02:16:52,380
My love keeps up all my wrestling

1812
02:16:52,380 --> 02:16:57,380
But my world was calling on one another

1813
02:16:57,380 --> 02:17:00,380
I will hold on to you

1814
02:17:00,380 --> 02:17:04,380
And I hope that you believe

1815
02:17:04,380 --> 02:17:07,380
Cause world

1816
02:17:37,380 --> 02:17:43,380
Wait, feel this on me, babe

1817
02:17:43,380 --> 02:17:47,380
Let your complete day

1818
02:17:47,380 --> 02:17:55,380
Wait, wait

1819
02:17:55,380 --> 02:18:01,380
Calling out, calling out, calling out, calling out

1820
02:18:01,380 --> 02:18:09,380
Where are you?

1821
02:18:09,380 --> 02:18:23,380
Where are you?

1822
02:18:23,380 --> 02:18:27,280
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

1823
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:30,280
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

1824
02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:45,380
Wave

1825
02:18:45,380 --> 02:18:48,640
Don't come easy to me

1826
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:52,260
How can I find a way

1827
02:18:52,260 --> 02:18:54,260
To make you see

1828
02:19:22,260 --> 02:19:24,260
You are my own

1829
02:19:24,260 --> 02:19:26,260
That I'm here to meet

1830
02:19:26,260 --> 02:19:28,260
And you know and I

1831
02:19:28,260 --> 02:19:32,260
When I say I love you, honey

1832
02:19:32,260 --> 02:19:36,260
Please believe I really do cry

1833
02:19:36,260 --> 02:20:02,420
Call it nice, call it nice Call it nice, call it nice

1834
02:20:02,420 --> 02:20:23,900
Alright, some kind of mixed reaction from the chat room on that one, the sign with words

1835
02:20:23,900 --> 02:20:25,940
sent to us by JB by request.

1836
02:20:25,940 --> 02:20:30,820
Okay, this is going to be the part now, we're tallying up your votes for the cage match,

1837
02:20:30,820 --> 02:20:36,580
However, when we come back, we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge, or ask Johnny, ask the

1838
02:20:36,580 --> 02:20:38,940
intern, zero, or ask Dave.

1839
02:20:38,940 --> 02:20:40,940
You are delinquent.

1840
02:20:40,940 --> 02:20:42,620
Bombay, you can ask Bombay.

1841
02:20:42,620 --> 02:20:46,540
And Bombay, what kind of questions would you want to answer, like things about freestyle,

1842
02:20:46,540 --> 02:20:47,540
things about...

1843
02:20:47,540 --> 02:20:48,540
Yeah, freestyle.

1844
02:20:48,540 --> 02:20:49,540
Because I'm trying to get in more to freestyle.

1845
02:20:49,540 --> 02:20:50,540
Okay.

1846
02:20:50,540 --> 02:20:52,580
I'm trying to compete more and get more experience and all that.

1847
02:20:52,580 --> 02:20:55,060
And then you guys know Dave and the intern by now, this is Johnny for sure.

1848
02:20:55,060 --> 02:20:58,140
Yo, yo, I go to McDonald's, not Delta Co.

1849
02:20:58,140 --> 02:20:59,140
Yo, yo.

1850
02:20:59,140 --> 02:21:00,140
Burkayfo!

1851
02:21:00,140 --> 02:21:06,180
Anyway, okay, so send us your questions over private message to sky and we'll get to those or if you're too lazy to be

1852
02:21:06,180 --> 02:21:10,500
In the chat room, just send them over email orange lounge radio all one word at yahoo.com

1853
02:21:11,420 --> 02:21:13,420
and you can also

1854
02:21:14,220 --> 02:21:19,020
Always send us your comments or whatever else so something bimani related for you guys that I promised earlier. Here you go

1855
02:21:19,020 --> 02:21:21,580
So we'll be back after this with Ask Orange Lounge.

1856
02:25:19,020 --> 02:25:44,020
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1857
02:25:44,020 --> 02:25:48,620
Let's go, Racco! Pick up the set, go! Let's go, Racco! Yeah!

1858
02:26:14,020 --> 02:26:17,020
a damn good fake and I want more by that faker.

1859
02:26:17,020 --> 02:26:22,100
Seriously, I seriously doubt that that's a fake because, I mean, hold on, it's absolute

1860
02:26:22,100 --> 02:26:26,700
and guitar, I mean, it doesn't sound like shit, and unlike M, you know, which obviously

1861
02:26:26,700 --> 02:26:32,700
could have been made by anybody, but this is a lot better. I don't see how this is a

1862
02:26:32,700 --> 02:26:33,700
fake.

1863
02:26:33,700 --> 02:26:36,620
Okay, well, there you have it. Like it or not, fake or not?

1864
02:26:36,620 --> 02:26:42,860
It could be quite possible that it's one of those special editions like the.59.

1865
02:26:42,860 --> 02:26:44,860
Very true, like the 0.59 live mix and stuff?

1866
02:26:44,860 --> 02:26:47,860
Well not the live one, but the really goth-y sounding one.

1867
02:26:47,860 --> 02:26:53,860
I have a DWI I'm making to like the second remix or whatever of 0.59.

1868
02:26:53,860 --> 02:26:59,860
It's like half done, and it actually has a backbeat to it instead of like how 0.59 originally was.

1869
02:26:59,860 --> 02:27:02,860
Well there was, the original one had a beat to it.

1870
02:27:02,860 --> 02:27:07,860
Well it's, I can't explain it, it seems more, it's a lot more fulfilling.

1871
02:27:07,860 --> 02:27:09,860
You hear it better the more that you play it in 2DS.

1872
02:27:09,860 --> 02:27:20,860
The thing about that remix that you're doing, it's like the piano, it makes sense at first but then it just goes into a different song after that.

1873
02:27:20,860 --> 02:27:25,860
So do you guys want to know who won the cage match?

1874
02:27:25,860 --> 02:27:26,860
Alright.

1875
02:27:26,860 --> 02:27:31,340
The cage match winner was, and I was surprised because Kylie did manage to get at least one

1876
02:27:31,340 --> 02:27:34,140
vote.

1877
02:27:34,140 --> 02:27:40,340
So not everybody sucks, alright.

1878
02:27:40,340 --> 02:27:45,980
But the winner was Sasha by quite a little bit of a landslide, ladies and gentlemen.

1879
02:27:45,980 --> 02:27:50,100
So Sasha takes it and is the winner of the cage match.

1880
02:27:50,100 --> 02:27:55,740
to think of something new next week. That means what I was talking about in here is

1881
02:27:55,740 --> 02:27:58,740
going to get played next week.

1882
02:27:58,740 --> 02:28:04,620
Alright. Well, you know, at least Loki can't bring in one of his remixes and win it for

1883
02:28:04,620 --> 02:28:06,740
sure because, you know, it's Loki.

1884
02:28:06,740 --> 02:28:10,540
No, never mind. Never mind. I will bring it next week. I'll bring something really good

1885
02:28:10,540 --> 02:28:11,540
next week.

1886
02:28:11,540 --> 02:28:17,820
Yeah, I'm going to fuck it up next week, too, and bring something really psycho. What? We'll

1887
02:28:17,820 --> 02:28:21,380
talk later we'll come up with a plan you know I'm thinking I'm thinking I'll get

1888
02:28:21,380 --> 02:28:25,500
that chick from American Idol that'll be my that'll be my cage might fix the

1889
02:28:25,500 --> 02:28:32,180
children of the world I found my child what about you know my you know remixes

02:28:32,180 --> 02:28:40,540

02:28:40,540 --> 02:28:44,420
that I know or anything she's a bitch on the show all right okay we're gonna do

1892
02:28:44,420 --> 02:28:56,460
ask orange lounge now you guys ready okay ask orange lounge here we go for

1893
02:28:56,460 --> 02:28:59,260
those that don't know ask orange lounge this is your opportunity to ask us

1894
02:28:59,260 --> 02:29:02,780
anything you've ever wanted to ask if you're sick that we don't happen we

1895
02:29:02,780 --> 02:29:05,740

1896
02:29:05,740 --> 02:29:08,900
questions would be happy to answer you want to know something about Loki sex

1897
02:29:08,900 --> 02:29:12,820
life and ask it maybe he'll answer it or maybe he'll come up maybe he'll come up

1898
02:29:12,820 --> 02:29:19,820
with a vicious lie. Who knows? Ask it and we'll answer it.

1899
02:29:20,820 --> 02:29:25,940
Alright, here we go. Black Lab has the first question because I made him hold it over until

1900
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:28,900
this segment because this was kind of the inspiration. Oh, we should do Ask Gordon last

1901
02:29:28,900 --> 02:29:33,100
night. It's a question for Jamie. Black Lab would like to know, whatever happened to the

1902
02:29:33,100 --> 02:29:37,380
Orange Lounge quiz? We were going to do a live journal quiz. You know how live journal

1903
02:29:37,380 --> 02:29:38,340
quizzes all the...

1904
02:29:38,340 --> 02:29:46,340
Okay, this is what happened. Jamie got a job, okay? End of story. I don't know, if you want

1905
02:29:46,340 --> 02:29:50,620
to help me make one, then we'll get on that, you know, Quizilla.com and put one together.

1906
02:29:50,620 --> 02:29:54,540
Maybe that'll be a project for this week. We'll see. But that's a good idea. I like

1907
02:29:54,540 --> 02:29:57,940
the idea of doing an horizontal quiz. I have to play P.S.O. Tuesday night P.S.O.

1908
02:29:57,940 --> 02:30:02,180
That's true, Tuesday night P.S.O. night. But you know, which reminds me, if you guys want

1909
02:30:02,180 --> 02:30:05,900
to, you know what, if you guys want to play P.S.O. with Jamie and I, we're looking for

1910
02:30:05,900 --> 02:30:10,500
a few good players. So come to the chat room, come to the chat room Tuesday night, and we'll

1911
02:30:10,500 --> 02:30:13,700
let you know what block and zone we're playing in. This is PSO GameCube.

1912
02:30:13,700 --> 02:30:17,300
First of all, remember that Jamie played her game all at once, and she actually needs to

1913
02:30:17,300 --> 02:30:19,700
get past level one. Well, I think what we're going to do, this

1914
02:30:19,700 --> 02:30:23,340
is the other stipulation. Tuesday night, if you come, new character. We're all going to

1915
02:30:23,340 --> 02:30:27,100
start with new characters for Tuesday night. Mine, even though I made her when I first

1916
02:30:27,100 --> 02:30:29,580
got the game, I've only played it once, so I'll leave her as she is.

1917
02:30:29,580 --> 02:30:32,940
Okay, that's fine. But it's got to be low level, so we all start at the same and progress

1918
02:30:32,940 --> 02:30:34,940
Nothing higher than level one.

1919
02:30:34,940 --> 02:30:38,940

1920
02:30:38,940 --> 02:30:41,940
Okay, what do you guys talk about back here?

1921
02:30:41,940 --> 02:30:43,940
I've never played PSO, I don't know what that is.

02:30:43,940 --> 02:30:44,940

Get a GameCube and a broadband adapter.

02:30:49,940 --> 02:30:50,940
I'll show it to you sometime.

1927
02:30:50,940 --> 02:30:51,940
Alright.

1928
02:30:51,940 --> 02:30:53,940
I think I might play my game tonight.

1929
02:30:53,940 --> 02:30:54,940
Here we go.

1930
02:30:54,940 --> 02:30:56,940
How about our simulation mean no one over level three?

1931
02:30:56,940 --> 02:30:57,940
Okay, that's fine.

1932
02:30:57,940 --> 02:30:58,940
Cause I'm gonna play tonight.

1933
02:30:58,940 --> 02:31:00,940
Alright, moving on.

02:31:31,420 --> 02:31:33,420
Loki.

1944
02:31:33,420 --> 02:31:35,420
Superhero.

1945
02:31:35,420 --> 02:31:38,420

1946
02:31:40,420 --> 02:31:42,420
Dude, one of my friends is like...

1947

If you're gonna say Jewman, I'm gonna say Nazi boy.

02:31:47,420 --> 02:31:49,420
It's my arch-rival!

1949
02:31:49,420 --> 02:31:51,420
Loki! Jesus!

1950
02:31:52,420 --> 02:31:55,420
We are gonna have to tape his mouth shut.

1951
02:31:55,420 --> 02:32:02,740
What is he's like Nazi boy the protector of the duty Loki is worse than t-shirt held calm tonight

Okay, I gotta apologize for my killing you comment, but um I would say orgasm. Oh orgasm. Oh

1962
02:33:18,720 --> 02:33:25,720
This should be a dub. My favorite superhero is Catwoman, of course.

1963
02:33:25,720 --> 02:33:28,440
She's a hero to some. She's a hero to me.

1964
02:33:28,440 --> 02:33:30,820
She's a hero to me and she's going to have her own movie.

1965
02:33:30,820 --> 02:33:32,240
Are the interns...

1966
02:33:32,240 --> 02:33:34,880
More questions from Jaheem. More questions from Jaheem.

1967
02:33:34,880 --> 02:33:38,560
Are the interns related to Godden?

1968
02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:45,880
No. He's a guy in SoCal.

1969
02:33:45,880 --> 02:33:51,880
Mel told me I should emcee a tournament with him, but I'm not related to him.

1970
02:33:51,880 --> 02:33:58,880
He seemed cool. I didn't really talk to him at all, because I was kind of introverted and clicky at Cyberbeat, unfortunately, because I'm a bitch.

1971
02:33:58,880 --> 02:34:04,880
I'm not really an intern, by the way. I'm just kind of sitting in, I guess. I guess.

1972
02:34:04,880 --> 02:34:05,880
You're a guest.

1973
02:34:05,880 --> 02:34:06,880
Monica Lewinsky was an intern.

1974
02:34:06,880 --> 02:34:11,880
That means we make him go do stuff.

1975
02:34:11,880 --> 02:34:17,760
Alright, next question. Is Orange Lounge for the children?

1976
02:34:17,760 --> 02:34:18,760
I don't know, but I think that...

1977
02:34:18,760 --> 02:34:22,560
The children of the liking to listen to crazy monkey sex?

1978
02:34:22,560 --> 02:34:28,040
Nope. JB will agree with me. You know, we actually are the founders of the Cup of Child

1979
02:34:28,040 --> 02:34:31,400
Foundation. You know, the new flavors of ramen, Cup of Child.

1980
02:34:31,400 --> 02:34:34,040
I'll answer that question.

1981
02:34:34,040 --> 02:34:41,400
There's skanky RVGL flavor. There's, you know, spicy scandia flavor. Then there's, you know,

1982
02:34:41,400 --> 02:34:43,400
There's CCL ass flavor.

1983
02:34:43,400 --> 02:34:46,400
No, no, remember that? That's drug and alcohol flavor.

1984
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:49,400
And then crud under the machine, uh, crusty flavor.

1985
02:34:49,400 --> 02:34:51,400
No, that's good.

1986
02:34:55,400 --> 02:34:56,400
Um, Orange Lounge...

1987
02:34:56,400 --> 02:34:57,400
Laser Force is non-existent flavor.

1988
02:34:57,400 --> 02:35:01,400
Orange Lounge is not for the children, but they listen to it anyway.

1989
02:35:01,400 --> 02:35:02,400
We think...

1990
02:35:02,400 --> 02:35:04,400
It's like porn.

1991
02:35:04,400 --> 02:35:05,400
We think that children are...

1992
02:35:05,400 --> 02:35:07,400
I can relate anything to porn.

1993
02:35:07,400 --> 02:35:16,400
I love how everyone thinks I'm a racist, porn addicted, crazy psychopath when I'm totally opposite in person.

1994
02:35:16,400 --> 02:35:21,400
Next question is for Loki.

1995
02:35:21,400 --> 02:35:24,400
And frosted with sugar and fortified with vitamins.

1996
02:35:24,400 --> 02:35:26,400
Next question is for Loki. Here we go.

1997
02:35:26,400 --> 02:35:28,400
Does Loki have a sex life?

1998
02:35:28,400 --> 02:35:30,400
Damn right I do!

1999
02:35:30,400 --> 02:35:38,400
Oh man, dude, seriously, you think I sound horny on air? Imagine my girlfriend, she's about ten times as horny as I am, so...

2000
02:35:38,400 --> 02:35:42,400
It's just like, holy crap.

2001
02:35:42,400 --> 02:35:47,400
It's a good... It's damn good.

2002
02:35:47,400 --> 02:35:51,400
For your birthday, we'll get you vitamins.

2003
02:35:51,400 --> 02:35:58,400
Seriously, I do need vitamins because I don't eat well at all. I eat like one meal a day, and it's normally junk food, and I'm tired, and...

2004
02:35:58,400 --> 02:36:00,400
Oh, do you need vitamins for Halloween?

2005
02:36:00,400 --> 02:36:01,900
Okay, but nah, that's alright.

2006
02:36:01,900 --> 02:36:07,400
SkylineDC505, Dave, do I still get prawn for my birthday?

2007
02:36:07,400 --> 02:36:12,400
Well, that depends on if I get my prawn from Loki.

2008
02:36:12,400 --> 02:36:15,400
I got two mics.

2009
02:36:15,400 --> 02:36:20,400
Anyways, I can get you both prawns, so that's no problem.

2010
02:36:20,400 --> 02:36:22,400
Where's my man from?

2011
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:24,400
I'm trying! He's not coming!

2012
02:36:24,400 --> 02:36:26,400
The men aren't coming in the prawn?

2013
02:36:44,400 --> 02:36:46,400
No, I haven't.

2014
02:36:46,400 --> 02:36:48,100
but i'm interested in reading it

2015
02:36:48,100 --> 02:36:49,140
i bet it's porn

2016
02:36:49,140 --> 02:36:49,940
no it's not

2017
02:36:49,940 --> 02:36:51,860
it's c o s f v b come on

2018
02:36:51,860 --> 02:36:53,900
second question is for dave

2019
02:36:53,900 --> 02:36:56,860
second question is for dave

2020
02:36:56,860 --> 02:36:57,980
you wanna ask it?

2021
02:36:57,980 --> 02:37:00,900
i'm leaning back i aint reading it from here

2022
02:37:00,900 --> 02:37:02,420
second question is for dave

2023
02:37:02,420 --> 02:37:06,700
did you ever beat that ancient boy game

2024
02:37:06,700 --> 02:37:10,180
no i never actually beat it i never played it after that one day

2025
02:37:10,180 --> 02:37:14,060
i just played it and i got to one bone left with two cracks in it

2026
02:37:14,060 --> 02:37:17,660
A bone and some crack. I think it was a bone.

2027
02:37:17,660 --> 02:37:22,140
I think that's what... No, no, you were throwing a bone. First you take crack, then you take bone.

2028
02:37:22,140 --> 02:37:24,740
Insert bone into crack.

2029
02:37:24,740 --> 02:37:27,260
Repeat as often as necessary

2030
02:37:27,260 --> 02:37:30,660
until you obtain desired results.

2031
02:37:30,660 --> 02:37:35,380
The end. Next question, and it's Bomani related, and it's an excellent question.

2032
02:37:35,380 --> 02:37:39,420
Satome Ranma wants to know, I ask Orange Lounge this, why is it so hard to find

2033
02:37:39,420 --> 02:37:44,340
Poppin' Music MP3s? Seriously? Not a house, pyramid, melobunk, or tromobunk anywhere,

2034
02:37:44,340 --> 02:37:47,340
dammit. Poppin' Music MP3 is hard to find.

2035
02:37:47,340 --> 02:37:53,420
First of all, Poppin' Music is really cool, but it does have a limited fan base, honestly.

2036
02:37:53,420 --> 02:37:58,940
You want Poppin' Music MP3s? Good for my style. Serious. Tons of MP3s for Poppin' Music stuff

2037
02:37:58,940 --> 02:38:04,540
there. Or, if you can't find them, look for Feeling Pomu, that's their sim, and I'm sure

2038
02:38:04,540 --> 02:38:09,060
if you find sim files for that, you'll probably find the MP3s as well.

2039
02:38:09,060 --> 02:38:15,060
You know how much of a pain in the ass it is to find sim files for that? I have it. I found all but two. Anywhere.

2040
02:38:15,060 --> 02:38:17,060
That's why you use the Japanese sim files.

2041
02:38:17,060 --> 02:38:30,060
I was going to actually suggest, if you're looking for pop and music mp3s, go download sim files because people make sim files to all these other Bomani game mp3s and pop and music happens to be made into files a lot.

2042
02:38:30,060 --> 02:38:32,060
Also, there's WinMX.

2043
02:38:32,060 --> 02:38:34,060
Very good.

2044
02:38:34,060 --> 02:38:39,540
and eBay they have three of the pop music soundtracks on eBay right now for

2045
02:38:39,540 --> 02:38:44,300
about five bucks a piece okay so tell me Rama also wants to know as a follow-up

2046
02:38:44,300 --> 02:38:48,700
question have you guys seen the original Japanese the ring scary shit Ringu I've

2047
02:38:48,700 --> 02:38:51,780
been wanting to because I want to see it before I see the u.s. one guess what it's

2048
02:38:51,780 --> 02:38:55,260
actually coming at the same time in the u.s. one they're releasing on dud ring

2049
02:38:55,260 --> 02:39:01,500
you yes so it's coming out the same time in the u.s. it's going to be subtitled

2050
02:39:01,500 --> 02:39:02,500
I believe.

2051
02:39:02,500 --> 02:39:03,500
I won.

2052
02:39:03,500 --> 02:39:04,500
Actually, Billy.

2053
02:39:04,500 --> 02:39:06,300
We were just talking about this earlier today.

2054
02:39:06,300 --> 02:39:07,980
Billy's seen it and he says it's very good.

2055
02:39:07,980 --> 02:39:10,220
I guess it's a three-part series there.

2056
02:39:10,220 --> 02:39:11,220
There's three of them.

2057
02:39:11,220 --> 02:39:13,260
Actually, I have a question for our chat room.

2058
02:39:13,260 --> 02:39:14,260
What's that?

2059
02:39:14,260 --> 02:39:18,580
I don't remember hardly anything about this movie, but I've been trying to find it.

2060
02:39:18,580 --> 02:39:21,220
I've been putting in all these clues trying to find this one movie.

2061
02:39:21,220 --> 02:39:24,020
I wonder if anyone's ever heard of it or knows what this is.

2062
02:39:24,020 --> 02:39:27,100
It had to have come out in the early 80s or late 70s.

2063
02:39:27,100 --> 02:39:31,220
It was this movie about these people who move into this house that's possessed by three

2064
02:39:31,220 --> 02:39:36,460
Japanese spirits and these people back then each killed themselves and then the

2065
02:39:36,460 --> 02:39:39,860
movie the people end up recreating the fight that led to the three there who

2066
02:39:39,860 --> 02:39:44,540
killed themselves and they kill themselves the same way this was this

2067
02:39:44,540 --> 02:39:49,140

all right next question

2097
02:41:06,940 --> 02:41:09,120
snub disloyal says

2098
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:11,720
first off what's the easiest only

2099
02:41:11,720 --> 02:41:15,540
i've gotten halfway into a few only seen even got to stow it on road attack once

2100
02:41:15,540 --> 02:41:17,560
but i haven't passed anything

2101
02:41:17,560 --> 02:41:19,060
easiest only

2102
02:41:19,060 --> 02:41:20,980
since i've barely ever played them

2103
02:41:20,980 --> 02:41:23,540
i would have to say i'm not the standard

2104
02:41:23,540 --> 02:41:26,820
way are you talking about extreme or

2105
02:41:26,820 --> 02:41:29,560
on max to ensure that you pass some of them like

2106
02:41:29,560 --> 02:41:31,380
soul six and shit

2107
02:41:31,380 --> 02:41:36,580
i'm so so thick is easy dot now he standard we had no use standard and uh...

2108
02:41:36,580 --> 02:41:38,060
that first one

2109
02:41:38,060 --> 02:41:43,980
yet nearly thirty but if you're talking about extreme which i think that you are

2110
02:41:43,980 --> 02:41:48,820
yet dance mania and then you know if you think

2111
02:41:48,820 --> 02:41:53,180
does not dance anyone have written the police in the phone

2112
02:41:53,180 --> 02:41:58,520
but it did

2113
02:41:58,520 --> 02:42:00,140
dot pop force

2114
02:42:00,140 --> 02:42:03,140
an easy one but that's not stop here

2115
02:42:03,140 --> 02:42:07,900
uh... your second question will have to answer offline because uh... we ban that

2116
02:42:07,900 --> 02:42:11,940
topic from discussion on the show so will answer your question offline

2117
02:42:11,940 --> 02:42:19,800
for you though. So, we'll get to that later. Alright, Japan Man wants to know, Dave, how

2118
02:42:19,800 --> 02:42:32,060
long is your shaft? That was a few months ago. Snip the tip, baby. No, I don't, I'm

2119
02:42:32,060 --> 02:42:37,060
I'm not going to answer that, like...

2120
02:42:37,060 --> 02:42:42,060
Yeah, more than you can handle.

2121
02:42:42,060 --> 02:42:43,060
Never.

2122
02:42:43,060 --> 02:42:45,060
It's above average, and that's all I'm saying.

2123
02:42:45,060 --> 02:42:46,060
Ah, above average.

2124
02:42:46,060 --> 02:42:48,060
It is!

2125
02:42:48,060 --> 02:42:49,060
Are you...

2126
02:42:49,060 --> 02:42:50,060
No, don't do that, please.

2127
02:42:50,060 --> 02:42:53,060
Are you comparable with Run Jeremy?

2128
02:42:53,060 --> 02:42:55,060
Comparable with Run Jeremy.

2129
02:42:55,060 --> 02:42:57,060
I have never seen it.

2130
02:42:57,060 --> 02:42:58,060
He's nine and three quarters.

2131
02:42:58,060 --> 02:42:59,060
What?

2132
02:42:59,060 --> 02:43:00,060
He's nine and three quarters.

2133
02:43:00,060 --> 02:43:22,060
Anyway, moving on, Daf Square wants to know, when is Sky's voice the game coming out?

2134
02:43:22,060 --> 02:43:25,300
We have that one that Stressa made, and I don't know if Angel helped them with that

2135
02:43:25,300 --> 02:43:26,300
or not.

2136
02:43:26,300 --> 02:43:31,060
No, I think it was all Stressa, because I know Stressa did the lyrics, and he made this

2137
02:43:31,060 --> 02:43:35,420
sim file of a parody that I did during a fuck-off show to Bumblebee.

2138
02:43:35,420 --> 02:43:36,420
And it's really embarrassing.

2139
02:43:36,420 --> 02:43:37,420
I can't believe...

2140
02:43:37,420 --> 02:43:38,420
I played it on the show last week.

2141
02:43:38,420 --> 02:43:41,200
The damn thing is actually being pretty widely distributed right now, which is pretty scary

2142
02:43:41,200 --> 02:43:42,200
to me.

2143
02:43:42,200 --> 02:43:43,200
I played it on the show last week.

2144
02:43:43,200 --> 02:43:44,200
Yeah, I know.

2145
02:43:44,200 --> 02:43:45,200
And you played it on the show.

2146
02:43:45,200 --> 02:43:46,200
I've been doing it before.

2147
02:43:46,200 --> 02:43:49,100
We need to do it the wrong show and just sing.

2148
02:43:49,100 --> 02:43:50,100
Sing to the music.

2149
02:43:50,100 --> 02:43:52,100
Like, you know, sing lyrics to Afro Nova.

2150
02:43:52,100 --> 02:43:54,100
Ehh, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

2151
02:43:54,100 --> 02:44:01,100
I will promise you guys, there will be another MP3.

2152
02:44:01,100 --> 02:44:04,100
There will be another MP3 of me singing on the site.

2153
02:44:04,100 --> 02:44:07,100
Sometimes, on the Orange Launch Radio sometime in the next week.

2154
02:44:07,100 --> 02:44:09,100
You know what everyone missed, though?

2155
02:44:09,100 --> 02:44:11,100
This was a few weeks ago.

2156
02:44:11,100 --> 02:44:13,100
She's been on the show a couple of times, Iguana Girl.

2157
02:44:13,100 --> 02:44:19,100
We were at, um, at Scandia doing our own version of Kuchimuda V.

2158
02:44:19,100 --> 02:44:44,180
Black Lab wants to know, is there a boba in your immediate future?

2159
02:44:44,180 --> 02:44:49,040
not tonight but maybe sometime this week just because I'm really personally I'm

2160
02:44:49,040 --> 02:44:53,620
really tired I was up until 5 a.m. last night and he's fault is that mine but

2161
02:44:53,620 --> 02:44:56,860
that means I ain't going to Boba tonight but maybe sometime this week because I

2162
02:44:56,860 --> 02:45:00,180
do I do kind of crave it I haven't had Boba at all this week or why I mean I

2163
02:45:00,180 --> 02:45:04,260
haven't had Boba in a while so I think we need to go we need to take a Loki

2164
02:45:04,260 --> 02:45:10,420
then Loki we need to go apartment hunting and then look for Boba all right

2165
02:45:10,420 --> 02:45:15,420
Dark Tetsuya wants to know, how do I let someone know I'm interested, if you know what I mean?

2166
02:45:15,420 --> 02:45:18,420
Excellent question. It's a pretty serious one.

2167
02:45:18,420 --> 02:45:23,420
You go up to them and go, you know what, I'm interested in you. Would you like to date? That's what you say.

2168
02:45:23,420 --> 02:45:32,420
To me, I mean, I'm a shy person too, honestly, and it's so hard for me to just go up to somebody and ask that. That's really bold.

2169
02:45:32,420 --> 02:45:37,780
Okay, I'm the worst at doing that type of shit ever. I like go up be like you're hot

2170
02:45:39,060 --> 02:45:44,620
What are you okay? What you okay? Here's what you really have to do you have to keep cereal in your pocket to feed them

2171
02:45:45,020 --> 02:45:47,020
Right Ryan back me up

2172
02:45:51,100 --> 02:45:55,060
Yeah as the resident woman okay first of all I

2173
02:45:56,140 --> 02:45:58,140
I'll be right back. I got to get this

2174
02:45:58,620 --> 02:46:00,620
as a resident woman

2175
02:46:00,620 --> 02:46:06,460
let Jamie speak let Jamie speak I think it is absolute bullshit to drop hints

2176
02:46:06,460 --> 02:46:12,260
that you like somebody you know because I mean it's like guys start acting

2177
02:46:12,260 --> 02:46:17,140
really weird when they're interested in you and you think that they have a

2178
02:46:17,140 --> 02:46:20,100
disease and so they start creeping you out you don't want to be around them

2179
02:46:20,100 --> 02:46:27,060
okay if you like somebody fucking tell them get them by themselves and go you

2180
02:46:27,060 --> 02:46:30,060
You know what? Do you want to hang out? Or you don't even have to say it right away.

2181
02:46:30,060 --> 02:46:35,060
Say, you know what? Would you like to go to a movie or go anywhere?

2182
02:46:35,060 --> 02:46:37,060
Now that's a little more along the lines of what I was saying.

2183
02:46:37,060 --> 02:46:39,060
I wouldn't say you just come out and say, I like you.

2184
02:46:39,060 --> 02:46:42,060
But like, you know, find out, talk to the person. People are going to talk to you.

2185
02:46:42,060 --> 02:46:44,060
They're always talking to the person.

2186
02:46:44,060 --> 02:46:46,060
And you talk and you find out what you have in common.

2187
02:46:46,060 --> 02:46:48,060
And then you go out and do that common thing.

2188
02:46:48,060 --> 02:46:54,060
But see, me and maybe I'm different among women because I don't like bullshit.

2189
02:46:54,060 --> 02:46:58,060
I'm like, if you want to go out with me, ask me if you want to go out with me.

2190
02:46:58,060 --> 02:47:01,060
Jamie, can I go out with you?

2191
02:47:01,060 --> 02:47:02,060
Of course.

2192
02:47:02,060 --> 02:47:07,060
I mean, I've gone out and said, hey, I think you're cool, I want to go out with you.

2193
02:47:07,060 --> 02:47:08,060
No, see, I'm too honest.

2194
02:47:08,060 --> 02:47:12,360
I'm like, you're hot, your face could use a little work, but you're still pretty hot,

2195
02:47:12,360 --> 02:47:17,060
so you want to go out, and then you'll be like, fuck you!

2196
02:47:17,060 --> 02:47:20,260
I think Jay Kinetic sums it up very nicely here.

2197
02:47:20,260 --> 02:47:24,100
Dude, try to get her to laugh at a joke, talk about a common topic, and then casually invite

2198
02:47:24,100 --> 02:47:25,540
her out to have lunch sometime.

2199
02:47:25,540 --> 02:47:26,940
Two simple things.

2200
02:47:26,940 --> 02:47:31,840
First of all, don't tell, don't have any of your friends do it for you.

2201
02:47:31,840 --> 02:47:33,780
Don't write a letter.

2202
02:47:33,780 --> 02:47:35,620
Just walk up and call them.

2203
02:47:35,620 --> 02:47:36,620
Remember it.

2204
02:47:36,620 --> 02:47:37,620
Talk to them.

2205
02:47:37,620 --> 02:47:38,620
Remember it.

2206
02:47:38,620 --> 02:47:40,140
Don't have your friends there when you ask.

2207
02:47:40,140 --> 02:47:45,300
If we've learned anything from Olimore, it's basically to go, I have money.

2208
02:47:45,300 --> 02:47:50,740
No, but actually, seriously, what you want to do is you want to definitely go up and

2209
02:47:50,740 --> 02:47:55,020
tell them because if you waste time by just like beating around the bush and stuff, you're

2210
02:47:55,020 --> 02:47:59,500
not only going to waste time, make yourself more stressed out and, and yeah, that might

2211
02:47:59,500 --> 02:48:03,860
happen in the meantime, but it's better to like, you know, instead of waiting forever

2212
02:48:03,860 --> 02:48:07,540
and then telling her and she's saying no to find out, you know, beforehand, you know,

2213
02:48:07,540 --> 02:48:12,580
say, Hey, I like you, hi, I'm not interested or hi, I'm interested, you know, whatever

2214
02:48:12,580 --> 02:48:17,160
she says, whatever she says back. And never casually make out with somebody you're not

2215
02:48:17,160 --> 02:48:22,460
interested in. What are you talking about, man? That's fun. No, because then they might

2216
02:48:22,460 --> 02:48:27,580
expect that you are interested in. Here it is. I have the greatest pickup line. Believe

2217
02:48:27,580 --> 02:48:31,580
it or not, I have the greatest pickup line for women. No, no, this is it. It's like,

2218
02:48:31,580 --> 02:48:38,580
no. You go up, you say, hey, I like peanut butter. Wanna fuck? Actually, the best pickup

2219
02:48:38,580 --> 02:48:44,260
The best pickup line that I've heard of is, um, what was it, is like, uh, do you like jogging?

2220
02:48:46,500 --> 02:48:51,940
And, well, the thing is, is, is it's gotten you in the conversation. It's not some awkward,

2221
02:48:51,940 --> 02:48:55,460
you know, some pickup line or whatever, and you should probably respond to that, you know,

2222
02:48:55,460 --> 02:49:02,900
then you're like, hi, my name is, you know. Did you realize, like, photography?

2223
02:49:02,900 --> 02:49:03,900
You like casual sex?

2224
02:49:03,900 --> 02:49:04,900
Kind of take pictures of you accidentally.

2225
02:49:04,900 --> 02:49:05,900
It's like, no.

2226
02:49:05,900 --> 02:49:06,900
Okay, bye.

2227
02:49:06,900 --> 02:49:09,900
It's like, hey, do you like casual sex?

2228
02:49:09,900 --> 02:49:10,900
No.

2229
02:49:10,900 --> 02:49:11,900
Hey, do you like casual sex?

2230
02:49:11,900 --> 02:49:12,900
Yeah.

2231
02:49:12,900 --> 02:49:13,900
Hi, my name is Dave.

2232
02:49:13,900 --> 02:49:16,080
I love casual sex.

2233
02:49:16,080 --> 02:49:17,780
This is Bimani Loveline.

2234
02:49:17,780 --> 02:49:21,220
I think that we should get together and have some some time because, you know, common interests.

2235
02:49:21,220 --> 02:49:23,620
We both like casual sex.

2236
02:49:23,620 --> 02:49:25,100
And yeah, go from there.

2237
02:49:25,100 --> 02:49:31,300
And by the way, never ever try to hit on somebody when they're working in an arcade.

2238
02:49:31,300 --> 02:49:38,300
This one really scary guy came, when I was working at Labs Castle, this one really scary guy came up to me and like, tried to pick me up.

2239
02:49:38,300 --> 02:49:44,300
I was like, oh, I'll come see you after work. I'm like, um, I have a boyfriend. Oh, well, that's okay. After you hang out with me, you won't want to be around him.

2240
02:49:44,300 --> 02:49:48,300
I'm like, sir, just being around you right now makes me very appreciative of my boyfriend.

2241
02:49:48,300 --> 02:49:52,300
Let me ask Neil, because he just walked in the room. Neil, what's the best way to pick up chicks?

2242
02:49:53,300 --> 02:49:56,300
I said, hi, I like peanut butter, what a fuck. What do you think?

2243
02:49:58,300 --> 02:49:59,300
Nice shoes.

2244
02:49:59,300 --> 02:50:06,300
the best way to pick up a girl is with your arms and then with your knees.

2245
02:50:06,300 --> 02:50:10,980
because girls fucking love shoes. I can't explain it.

2246
02:50:10,980 --> 02:50:17,900
Would you like some pizza and then go fuck? No? How about we can skip the pizza?

2247
02:50:17,900 --> 02:50:22,460
The best way to pick up a girl is with your arms and then with your knees.

2248
02:50:22,460 --> 02:50:26,020
All right, all right. No, no. I think we got the serious answer out.

2249
02:50:26,020 --> 02:50:30,780
The best way I ever hooked up with a guy one time, and actually this is an incredibly nerdy

2250
02:50:30,780 --> 02:50:32,460
way but I thought it was pretty funny,

2251
02:50:32,460 --> 02:50:40,460
We played D&D, and our characters hooked up, and then we started dating.

2252
02:50:40,460 --> 02:50:43,460
Because we started dropping the hints through our characters, and then we went out.

2253
02:50:43,460 --> 02:50:47,460
You flirted virtually, that's so interesting. Alright, alright.

2254
02:50:47,460 --> 02:50:48,460
Better living through roleplay.

2255
02:50:48,460 --> 02:50:52,460
Here we go. Moving on, moving on, because we've got to wrap up the show pretty soon here.

2256
02:50:52,460 --> 02:50:55,460
Okay, that wasn't a question, that was a yay, but we appreciate those two.

2257
02:50:55,460 --> 02:51:03,460
Okay. EOSFBB wants to know, which female targeted cartoons that most would be ashamed to admit they watched are your favorites?

2258
02:51:03,460 --> 02:51:13,460
For instance, oh, okay. EOSFBB says, is the movie Jamie talking about called House translation, which is from 1977 put out by Toho, I think.

2259
02:51:13,460 --> 02:51:19,460
I don't know. See, I don't remember the name of it, but I knew that it was late 70s, early 80s.

2260
02:51:19,460 --> 02:51:22,460
And it had three people who ended up killing themselves in the end of the movie.

2261
02:51:22,460 --> 02:51:24,460
Look at that. Look on Internet Movie Database. Try that. House.

2262
02:51:24,460 --> 02:51:26,460
Save that. Actually, email that to me.

2263
02:51:54,460 --> 02:51:56,400
her the unico

2264
02:51:56,400 --> 02:51:59,280
yes of course you know how we don't need it

2265
02:51:59,280 --> 02:52:00,580
you know i think it's cool

2266
02:52:00,580 --> 02:52:01,440
well anyway

2267
02:52:01,440 --> 02:52:04,840
is that guys can only get away with really watching guys cartoons but

2268
02:52:04,840 --> 02:52:07,680
we can watch what the hell we want well what would be your favorite then jamie

2269
02:52:07,680 --> 02:52:12,200
it's kind of a moot point for cheeky stuff? yeah cheeky girly things

2270
02:52:12,200 --> 02:52:13,560
no not hello kitty

2271
02:52:13,560 --> 02:52:17,080
well i'm trying to think of stuff that's not anime because there is shoujo and shounen

2272
02:52:17,080 --> 02:52:18,740
anime

2273
02:52:18,740 --> 02:52:30,740
I think as far as anime is considered, I would have to go with Pre-Tier, The Legend of Snow White, which none of you have probably ever seen.

2274
02:52:30,740 --> 02:52:31,740
Loki?

2275
02:52:31,740 --> 02:52:35,740
As far as guy stuff goes, it'd freakin' be Berserk.

2276
02:52:35,740 --> 02:52:40,740
I don't watch freakin' girly cartoons, so there!

2277
02:52:40,740 --> 02:52:42,740
Yeah, me neither!

2278
02:52:42,740 --> 02:52:44,740
I don't know what Unico is.

2279
02:52:44,740 --> 02:52:48,740
I have the answer. When I was a kid, when I was younger, when I was in junior high,

2280
02:52:48,740 --> 02:52:50,740
it was all about the Beverly Hills teens.

2281
02:52:50,740 --> 02:52:52,740
Yes! Oh my god!

2282
02:52:54,740 --> 02:52:55,740
Jem and the Holograms.

2283
02:52:55,740 --> 02:52:56,740
Yes!

2284
02:52:56,740 --> 02:52:59,740
I didn't really watch Jem, but Beverly Hills teens, every damn day.

2285
02:52:59,740 --> 02:53:02,740
I have a friend who has every episode of Jem on tape.

2286
02:53:04,740 --> 02:53:05,740
Are they good college?

2287
02:53:05,740 --> 02:53:08,740
Or, or, and, or, and this is the gimme.

2288
02:53:08,740 --> 02:53:10,740
This is the one I'm sure everybody thought we would say.

2289
02:53:10,740 --> 02:53:11,740
She-ra. Hello.

2290
02:53:11,740 --> 02:53:13,740
Okay, She-ra.

2291
02:53:13,740 --> 02:53:16,740
But that was with He-Man.

2292
02:53:16,740 --> 02:53:18,740
Yes, Shiro was kind of a zenith.

2293
02:53:46,740 --> 02:53:49,740
Anybody can answer this, though. Anybody that has freestyled in the past, Francis.

2294
02:53:49,740 --> 02:53:50,740
Yes.

2295
02:53:50,740 --> 02:53:52,740
How do you face your fear against the crowd?

2296
02:53:52,740 --> 02:53:54,740
How do I? Okay.

2297
02:53:54,740 --> 02:53:55,740
Excellent question.

2298
02:53:55,740 --> 02:53:56,740
Okay, wait, Ryan.

2299
02:53:56,740 --> 02:53:57,740
Ryan.

2300
02:53:59,740 --> 02:54:00,740
Okay.

2301
02:54:00,740 --> 02:54:08,740
All right, well, how I face my fear is, I basically, when you don't think, like, when you're up there on the stage, it's like the same as PA.

2302
02:54:08,740 --> 02:54:10,740
When you PA, you think of PA, right?

2303
02:54:10,740 --> 02:54:21,740
The same thing with freestyling. When you're freestyling, you think about having fun and, you know, just having a good time. You try not to think about, oh, what are they going to think? You just have a good time. Just be yourself, basically.

2304
02:54:21,740 --> 02:54:34,740
Here's the simple thing I realized about freestyling altogether when it comes to the crowds is, first of all, just imagine or pretend that you're practicing alone. There's nobody around you, and when you turn around, just don't see anybody there.

2305
02:54:34,740 --> 02:54:39,740
Because that way, you're not going to feel nervous at all because it's just like you're practicing and having a good time on your own.

2306
02:54:39,740 --> 02:54:46,500
No, what I do is, first of all, if you never want to feel nervous again, just first go

2307
02:54:46,500 --> 02:54:52,180
up there naked, and then everyone will laugh and bust out, and then every other tournament

2308
02:54:52,180 --> 02:54:58,180
you'll just be like, man, this won't be as bad as the last time when I was naked.

2309
02:54:58,180 --> 02:55:02,060
Honestly though, that one and only freestyle that we did, I forgot that there was a crowd

2310
02:55:02,060 --> 02:55:03,060
going together.

2311
02:55:03,060 --> 02:55:08,340
No, and mainly, most of the time, the more outrageous stuff that you do that you would

2312
02:55:08,340 --> 02:55:13,940
think would be embarrassing people love it like like like Ryan in his and all

2313
02:55:13,940 --> 02:55:21,820
the women would stand up cheering and so would Rob anyway a grass skirt and a

2314
02:55:21,820 --> 02:55:27,900
tiki mask holding a spear doing Afro Nova that was my suggestion my

2315
02:55:27,900 --> 02:55:30,580
suggestion for the freestyle because Jamie and I have done one freestyle

2316
02:55:30,580 --> 02:55:34,060
there's pretty infamous by the way you can find that video still on DDR

2317
02:55:34,060 --> 02:55:37,660
forgetting yes I've yet to watch that and I won't ever I might have it

2318
02:55:37,660 --> 02:55:45,660
Anyway, my advice, get up there and don't give a flying fuck what anyone in that crowd feels about you.

2319
02:55:45,660 --> 02:55:47,660
Just don't care what anyone thinks.

2320
02:55:47,660 --> 02:55:52,660
Go up there for yourself to have fun, to just do it and forget about everybody else,

2321
02:55:52,660 --> 02:55:54,660
because their opinion doesn't mean shit.

2322
02:55:54,660 --> 02:55:59,660
And one thing too, is when you freestyle, don't really give a fuck about the arrows.

2323
02:55:59,660 --> 02:56:05,660
Hit a few, but mostly all people are watching is you dancing, they're not watching the arrows.

2324
02:56:05,660 --> 02:56:09,660
All you have to do is pass. You're not in the game. All you have to do is pass.

2325
02:56:35,660 --> 02:56:51,660
Good. You may or may not remember at Shaft when Tran actually failed his routine the first time, crowd demanded he go again, because well I mean there was also the other circumstance going on where he meant to do fourth mix and the fourth mix was broken so we had to do the sim, but he ended up taking second place, not too shabby.

2326
02:56:52,660 --> 02:56:53,660
That was nice.

2327
02:56:54,660 --> 02:56:58,660
That was my bad for not turning auto fail off. Dope.

2328
02:56:59,660 --> 02:57:00,660
It's all good, we all make mistakes.

2329
02:57:00,660 --> 02:57:10,660
Ask Orange Lounge

2330
02:57:30,660 --> 02:57:38,660
I work there and on weekends they have a policy, Friday after 5 o'clock is considered weekend, I'm not allowed to be there on weekends.

2331
02:57:38,660 --> 02:57:46,660
So Friday after 5 o'clock I'm not allowed to be there. Saturday and Sunday I'm also not allowed to be there. At all. There, the end.

2332
02:57:46,660 --> 02:58:04,660
Pretty much. Just goes along with the freestyle thing. It's one last thing. Just have fun with it. Don't even care how you look. And for everyone else playing DDR, just go and have fun with it and don't even bother what other people think of you.

2333
02:58:04,660 --> 02:58:12,660
I'd like to add something to that. Also, just like, you know, look like you're having fun. If you're up there concentrating too hard, it's not going to look good.

2334
02:58:12,660 --> 02:58:17,100
Absolutely. Bruce Leroy, many say he won Cyberbee on his expressions, period.

2335
02:58:17,100 --> 02:58:22,380
Well, and also when I was making up the grading sheets for Shaft, that was the big thing I

2336
02:58:22,380 --> 02:58:27,420
had in their face, you know, how well they react with the audience.

2337
02:58:27,420 --> 02:58:30,220
It counted for a quarter of their score.

2338
02:58:30,220 --> 02:58:31,220
Okay.

2339
02:58:31,220 --> 02:58:32,220
Oh.

2340
02:58:32,220 --> 02:58:35,940
And, hey, DVR Colic's back. Have comments?

2341
02:58:35,940 --> 02:58:41,340
Well, I missed most of the show, but if you guys were talking about freestyling, my input

2342
02:58:41,340 --> 02:58:48,340
would be to just have fun because it seems like no matter what happens, the crowd likes

2343
02:58:48,340 --> 02:58:53,600
freestyling, even if you suck. They don't want to see you just stomp. They want to see

2344
02:58:53,600 --> 02:59:00,600
you do something. Find the closest person to the stage and go try hump their leg. Winner!

2345
02:59:03,140 --> 02:59:09,520
Do anything and don't have any fear because there's nothing to fear. That's it. One last

2346
02:59:09,520 --> 02:59:16,520
If little kids run across the crosswalk, feel free to kick a little leg out there and let them just do cartwheel right off the side of the thing after you kick them.

2347
02:59:16,520 --> 02:59:20,520
I'm wondering if anyone in here remembers Big Cans?

2348
02:59:20,520 --> 02:59:21,520
Yeah.

2349
02:59:21,520 --> 02:59:26,520
Rob's half-finished edit to kick the can started off really hard and then there was like nothing else.

2350
02:59:26,520 --> 02:59:30,520
I remember when the fourth mix was there at Goughland.

2351
02:59:30,520 --> 02:59:34,520
Yeah, it was Rick and Paul just ran off and started running all over Goughland.

2352
02:59:34,520 --> 02:59:35,520
No.

2353
02:59:35,520 --> 02:59:37,520
They were like doing bar hops and slapping hands across it.

2354
02:59:37,520 --> 02:59:40,520
No, they hopped off and started running around the arcade too.

2355
02:59:40,520 --> 02:59:41,520
Yeah.

2356
02:59:41,520 --> 02:59:42,520
Oh, wait, wait.

2357
02:59:42,520 --> 02:59:47,520
Me and Pat also healing, uh, I wear orange beanie.

2358
02:59:47,520 --> 02:59:50,520
We have, uh, we also have a freestyle to, uh, Sugaru.

2359
02:59:50,520 --> 02:59:51,520
No, Master Ride Japan.

2360
02:59:51,520 --> 02:59:53,520
I'm sorry.

2361
02:59:53,520 --> 02:59:58,520
Where, where we just run around the arcade and just like, that's about it.

2362
02:59:58,520 --> 03:00:00,520
Would you, uh, would you love to meet Maniac Little?

2363
03:00:00,520 --> 03:00:01,520
Really?

2364
03:00:01,520 --> 03:00:06,520
There's like, what is it, 32 measures of no steps?

2365
03:00:06,520 --> 03:00:08,000
All right.

2366
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:09,160
Anyway, your final thoughts?

2367
03:00:09,160 --> 03:00:11,680
My final thoughts is we didn't cover it.

2368
03:00:11,680 --> 03:00:15,040
The step chart site went down, just so everyone knows,

2369
03:00:15,040 --> 03:00:17,800
because that's kind of major news and stuff.

2370
03:00:17,800 --> 03:00:19,920
So the step chart site went down.

2371
03:00:19,920 --> 03:00:22,640
There's a new one coming back up, so look for that.

2372
03:00:22,640 --> 03:00:25,920
My site, I'm working on it.

2373
03:00:25,920 --> 03:00:27,600
There's actually going to be a complete,

2374
03:00:27,600 --> 03:00:29,280
I'm going to redo all the graphics again, actually,

2375
03:00:29,280 --> 03:00:31,000
because I don't like the way they are right now.

2376
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:35,640
and I'm going to make it simpler. And if you're lucky, if you're very, very lucky, I might

2377
03:00:35,640 --> 03:00:42,440
upload Second Style through Fourth Style, all the MP3s, all the DWIs I have for that

2378
03:00:42,440 --> 03:00:46,600
tomorrow, if you're lucky.

2379
03:00:46,600 --> 03:00:53,960
All I got to say is that me and Johnny, like a few weeks ago, we started, like it was at

2380
03:00:53,960 --> 03:00:59,200
like 3 o'clock in the morning in my car, and because we were like parked outside someone's

2381
03:00:59,200 --> 03:01:04,000
house and anyway and so we were like really late and we were trying to like

2382
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:12,160
rap and shit he's like okay David go and some like yo I went to McDonald and like

2383
03:01:12,160 --> 03:01:17,500
we started making all these weird names to like to fast food chains so now we

2384
03:01:17,500 --> 03:01:22,600
have we have it's called our ghetto slang for fast food chains yes yeah

2385
03:01:22,600 --> 03:01:43,600
We have McDonald's, Burger King, and Delta Cup, which is Del Taco, and Jack in the Box is Jack in the Box.

2386
03:01:43,600 --> 03:01:47,600
I still prefer Jack in the Box.

2387
03:01:47,600 --> 03:01:51,600
Anyway, that's, that's what we have.

2388
03:01:51,600 --> 03:01:54,600
Delta, come out!

2389
03:01:54,600 --> 03:01:56,600
Blink, blink, blink.

2390
03:01:56,600 --> 03:02:01,600
Alright, my final thought is that choking when you're drinking water live on air really sucks.

2391
03:02:01,600 --> 03:02:03,600
Does that just happen to me? Jamie?

2392
03:02:03,600 --> 03:02:06,600
