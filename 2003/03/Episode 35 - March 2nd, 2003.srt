1
00:00:06,119 --> 00:00:10,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

2
00:00:11,622 --> 00:00:16,666
[SPEAKER_17]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

3
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,221
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

4
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:26,723
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

5
00:00:27,303 --> 00:00:30,004
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

6
00:00:30,544 --> 00:00:33,445
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

7
00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:34,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

8
00:00:34,846 --> 00:00:36,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

9
00:00:36,646 --> 00:00:44,109
[SPEAKER_13]: In this episode... Hey, any balls down there?

10
00:00:44,349 --> 00:00:46,850
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the biggest bear you've ever seen, Jingleberry.

11
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,651
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your favorite scary movie?

12
00:00:50,077 --> 00:00:50,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Showgirls.

13
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:52,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely frightful.

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,540
[SPEAKER_03]: What's yours?

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,262
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

16
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't torture yourself.

17
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,245
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my job.

18
00:00:59,265 --> 00:01:00,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Now's the time our sprockets bend me dogs!

19
00:01:01,006 --> 00:01:04,129
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll get you, my pretty.

20
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:05,751
[SPEAKER_15]: And your little dog, too.

21
00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:06,972
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Kung Fu.

22
00:01:07,332 --> 00:01:09,694
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

23
00:01:09,974 --> 00:01:11,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Why did they have to take the word gay?

24
00:01:13,437 --> 00:01:16,099
[SPEAKER_22]: Nobody expects a Spanish exposition.

25
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,180
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Kendo.

26
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:17,661
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey!

27
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:21,833
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, Shut up!

28
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:22,714
[SPEAKER_22]: Where's my gun?

29
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:24,797
[SPEAKER_22]: This is my boomstick!

30
00:01:25,257 --> 00:01:27,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Sky, Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

31
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:32,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

32
00:01:32,146 --> 00:01:34,649
[SPEAKER_15]: What kind of warping being would find that funny?

33
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:36,191
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio,

34
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:44,247
[SPEAKER_04]: We are live, and this is episode number 35 for March the 2nd of 2003.

35
00:01:44,307 --> 00:01:52,497
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're tuned into the Lamonti Scene's most crowded radio station of all things bee money, my name is...

36
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,262
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts.

37
00:01:55,302 --> 00:01:56,622
[SPEAKER_04]: You might know me as Sky.

38
00:01:57,783 --> 00:01:58,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a poet and I don't know it.

39
00:01:59,304 --> 00:02:00,825
[SPEAKER_02]: But your feet are short because they're long-fellows.

40
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:02,666
[SPEAKER_04]: My feet are big.

41
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:04,087
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what that means.

42
00:02:04,147 --> 00:02:05,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Attention guys out there.

43
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:06,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob wears big shoes.

44
00:02:06,808 --> 00:02:15,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest and most loud-mouthed bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

45
00:02:15,693 --> 00:02:19,655
[SPEAKER_04]: You know her better as DarkSakura.

46
00:02:20,216 --> 00:02:22,297
[SPEAKER_04]: In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

47
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:29,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Also with us tonight, we have a whole ass load of guests.

48
00:02:29,336 --> 00:02:31,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to Shark Skrulls in the house.

49
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,662
[SPEAKER_21]: Everyone else is in the other room playing Animal Crossing.

50
00:02:34,682 --> 00:02:35,603
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm thinking about joining them.

51
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:36,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, traitor.

52
00:02:37,485 --> 00:02:38,807
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, I gotta get bones back.

53
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:45,314
[SPEAKER_04]: And also with us, say hello to Mel B. I believe that children are our future.

54
00:02:51,323 --> 00:02:52,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to Dave.

55
00:02:53,084 --> 00:02:53,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

56
00:02:53,564 --> 00:02:54,684
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't been here in a while.

57
00:02:55,285 --> 00:02:56,805
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a whole bunch of other people.

58
00:02:56,825 --> 00:02:57,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, Brad.

59
00:02:57,685 --> 00:02:58,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, say hello to Brad.

60
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:02,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you balking?

61
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:04,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, shit.

62
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:08,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops, I had a little technical difficulty there.

63
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:08,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.

64
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

65
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:10,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello.

66
00:03:10,771 --> 00:03:11,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hi, Brad.

67
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:12,911
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the back is the Ice Queen.

68
00:03:14,452 --> 00:03:15,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to the Ice Queen.

69
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:15,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on in.

70
00:03:19,036 --> 00:03:21,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's twice this month I've been called a douchebag.

71
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:27,019
[SPEAKER_22]: Tell me, Rob, do you feel not so fresh?

72
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that's right, we're in a new month now.

73
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:31,620
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means next month somebody else has to call Rob a douchebag.

74
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:34,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Who wants to take the turn this time?

75
00:03:35,461 --> 00:03:36,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you can do it.

76
00:03:36,402 --> 00:03:37,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget, April 1st.

77
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:39,903
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you have to do it April 2nd because it's a joke.

78
00:03:39,963 --> 00:03:42,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting reports that all of our listeners might...

79
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:32,603
Thanks for watching!

80
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:39,656
Thanks for watching!

81
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:35,025
[SPEAKER_14]: From StepSquad to OrangeLabs, this PDR sucks!

82
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:40,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla!

83
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:46,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently Dave knows what camel piss tastes like.

84
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:49,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Tastes just like it smells.

85
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:50,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're back.

86
00:06:52,150 --> 00:07:03,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately what happened just before the break, for some reason, we didn't show ourselves as going down off the air, but all our listeners got dropped, so they're slowly coming back on the stream, and it's kind of ironic that they should come back to the beauty of silence.

87
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:05,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

88
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:08,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Ow, ow, I hurt.

89
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:10,956
[SPEAKER_22]: You'll hurt after I kick you.

90
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:14,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so, what's up?

91
00:07:14,678 --> 00:07:16,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Big round table, just stuff.

92
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:17,099
[SPEAKER_02]: What table?

93
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,640
[SPEAKER_02]: There's four.

94
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,001
[SPEAKER_04]: We had round table pizza for lunch.

95
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:20,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Indian chair?

96
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:21,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, somebody else.

97
00:07:22,523 --> 00:07:23,443
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Eastern Buffet.

98
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,104
[SPEAKER_04]: If it is Ryan, tell him where his letter is.

99
00:07:25,124 --> 00:07:27,105
[SPEAKER_02]: We ate somewhere much better than round table.

100
00:07:27,366 --> 00:07:28,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, where'd you guys go for lunch today?

101
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:30,988
[SPEAKER_21]: Where did we go for lunch?

102
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:32,168
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, we went to Eastern Buffet.

103
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:34,350
[SPEAKER_21]: We had Chinese food and it was yummy.

104
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:37,943
[SPEAKER_04]: So today's a little bit of a buzz show.

105
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:43,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm downing a Smirnoff Black with Mel.

106
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,789
[SPEAKER_04]: A toast to a non-crappy show for once.

107
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:51,312
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.

108
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:52,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's all here?

109
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:52,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Dang.

110
00:07:53,154 --> 00:07:55,315
[SPEAKER_21]: It sounded like five people just got here.

111
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:57,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Who got here?

112
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:02,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

113
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,021
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, how's today?

114
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:06,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Today it is kind of a full house.

115
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:07,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

116
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:08,790
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

117
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:13,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Everywhere we go, everywhere you look.

118
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:17,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, after what we were watching today that showed what's your face from full house.

119
00:08:17,336 --> 00:08:18,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Candace Cameron.

120
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Candace Cameron.

121
00:08:22,164 --> 00:08:23,966
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell ever happened to Candace Cameron?

122
00:08:24,266 --> 00:08:24,927
[SPEAKER_21]: She's very pretty.

123
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know.

124
00:08:25,748 --> 00:08:27,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going on the website to look.

125
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:34,938
[SPEAKER_21]: Candace Cameron met a hockey player by the name of Valerie Brewery and got engaged in Paris and got married and has two kids.

126
00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:35,439
[SPEAKER_21]: Go fig.

127
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,102
[SPEAKER_21]: And she looked like a slut for a long time because she had platinum blonde hair.

128
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:39,536
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

129
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hello to our other guests who just got here.

130
00:09:06,321 --> 00:09:06,741
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

131
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:08,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello and introduce yourselves.

132
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:09,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have much room on the mics here.

133
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:12,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's up?

134
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:13,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone knows me.

135
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:13,824
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Zero.

136
00:09:13,984 --> 00:09:14,464
[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going?

137
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:15,524
The intern.

138
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:16,685
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

139
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,026
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Johnny, a.k.a.

140
00:09:19,086 --> 00:09:19,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Bombay.

141
00:09:22,307 --> 00:09:25,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and now I'm going to finish talking about Candace Cameron.

142
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:28,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Billy the Big Fat Queer is here!

143
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:30,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello, Billy!

144
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:32,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

145
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:34,012
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you, Billy?

146
00:09:34,653 --> 00:09:35,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Peachy Keen

147
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:54,512
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave some guys... Wait, no, no, no, no.

148
00:09:55,413 --> 00:09:55,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

149
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:57,474
[SPEAKER_04]: First Candice, then your story.

150
00:09:58,235 --> 00:09:59,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hi, you're listening to Orange Lounge, Bomani Radio.

151
00:09:59,896 --> 00:10:02,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes we talk about the game with the arrows.

152
00:10:02,297 --> 00:10:02,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear it's popular.

153
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:05,039
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway... And we talk about porn a lot.

154
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:32,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Since her years as DJ Tanner on the long-running sitcom Full House, she has had the lead role in six movies, guest starred on four television shows, and executive produced an entertaining child safety show.

155
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:33,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

156
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:44,963
[SPEAKER_04]: She is married to ice hockey player Valery Bire, who sucks ass, and has three children.

157
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:47,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to know what their association is.

158
00:10:48,246 --> 00:10:51,169
[SPEAKER_07]: They're named Suck, Ass, and Who.

159
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:57,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Come here, suck.

160
00:10:58,068 --> 00:10:58,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Come here, ass.

161
00:10:58,929 --> 00:10:59,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

162
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:09,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Since I was 10 years old, Candice has been a distraught role model for me through her varied acting roles and admirable participation in organizations like the Starlight Foundation.

163
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:10,316
[SPEAKER_22]: Which sucks ass.

164
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, that's a charity.

165
00:11:12,598 --> 00:11:13,558
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an ass-sucking charity.

166
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Her openness and love... Oh, wait, wait, wait.

167
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the best part.

168
00:11:17,181 --> 00:11:20,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Her openness and love for Christianity is refreshing.

169
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,201
[SPEAKER_04]: and the Church of Ass-Sucking.

170
00:11:25,744 --> 00:11:27,588
[SPEAKER_10]: So she sucks little boys' asses then.

171
00:11:30,832 --> 00:11:32,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

172
00:11:32,214 --> 00:11:33,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

173
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:35,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Refreshing is this nice malt beverage right here.

174
00:11:35,436 --> 00:11:38,679
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it talks about growing up with Candice.

175
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,864
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to visit All About Candice Cameron, go to www.candicecameronbure.net.

176
00:11:45,286 --> 00:11:46,266
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to suck some ass.

177
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:49,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

178
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of sucking ass, let's get to story time with Billy.

179
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:56,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Storytime with Billy!

180
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:21,785
[SPEAKER_07]: This better be the Jerry Halliwell version.

181
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:22,666
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the Jerry Halliwell.

182
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,246
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the DDR Jerry Halliwell version.

183
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:25,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell your tale, Billy.

184
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:29,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it was Mardi Gras night, and we had quite a bit of fun, and I got a couple beats here and there.

185
00:12:30,388 --> 00:12:31,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, and how did you get beats?

186
00:12:33,148 --> 00:12:33,769
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you think?

187
00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:37,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you show your titties to some lesbians?

188
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,510
[SPEAKER_07]: I did show my titties to some lesbians.

189
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,431
[SPEAKER_07]: And then some cute boys just walked in and gave me beats.

190
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:43,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't have to show them anything.

191
00:12:43,771 --> 00:12:44,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

192
00:12:45,012 --> 00:12:50,153
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyways, on the way out, there was a cute drunk boy, and he saw, I didn't give him any beats, so I'm like, what are you going to give me?

193
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:55,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Billy just cut right to the chase.

194
00:12:55,425 --> 00:12:57,125
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you going to give me?

195
00:12:57,145 --> 00:12:59,306
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll let you stick your hand down my pants.

196
00:12:59,366 --> 00:13:01,727
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, well, okay.

197
00:13:04,468 --> 00:13:05,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that I'm complaining.

198
00:13:05,469 --> 00:13:06,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got quite a handful.

199
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:13,912
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Matt got a C. And I got a hold of it and see it.

200
00:13:13,952 --> 00:13:16,533
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was a wonderful, fun night.

201
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:17,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Matt's here.

202
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:18,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, come here, come here.

203
00:13:18,054 --> 00:13:19,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have anything you want to add to this story, Matt?

204
00:13:20,294 --> 00:13:21,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I'm sorry, the Ice Queen?

205
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,632
[SPEAKER_00]: What he got to grab, I got to see.

206
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,775
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted some more beats, he came up to me and said, well, what do I got to do to get some beats?

207
00:13:30,855 --> 00:13:32,376
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, you know, you got to show me your stuff.

208
00:13:33,036 --> 00:13:34,657
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he whipped it right out, and there it was.

209
00:13:35,738 --> 00:13:37,699
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got to see what he got to grab.

210
00:13:41,744 --> 00:13:44,885
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he asked for beads for me too, so I'm like, what do I get?

211
00:13:44,905 --> 00:13:46,205
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, I get the same thing.

212
00:13:46,565 --> 00:13:54,887
[SPEAKER_04]: So I gave him some beads, and like, you know, he opened up his pants, and you know, I started to put my hand on there, and I'm like, no, no, honey, I've got more class than Billy does.

213
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Prude.

214
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:57,668
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a prude.

215
00:13:57,988 --> 00:13:59,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to start fights in the parking lot.

216
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:05,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sometimes we talk about some arrow game, I don't know.

217
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:07,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Monkey 6.

218
00:14:09,241 --> 00:14:13,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I filled your gay sex quota, now it's time for... Yeah, the show is getting too gay.

219
00:14:13,742 --> 00:14:19,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Pussy, cunt, clit, cock... Thank you.

220
00:14:20,004 --> 00:14:23,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, quick, the chatroom is getting restless because we haven't talked about anything but Monty yet.

221
00:14:23,385 --> 00:14:25,405
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Loki, give us a topic.

222
00:14:25,605 --> 00:14:26,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Monty sucks ass.

223
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us a topic we can have a roundtable about.

224
00:14:27,926 --> 00:14:28,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh god, okay.

225
00:14:29,226 --> 00:14:39,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Starting off this week, well obviously everyone knows that DDR Max 2, the Japanese version, is coming out April 25th, I believe.

226
00:14:40,768 --> 00:14:42,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, April 25th.

227
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:51,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Also announced with it is going to be a brand new V-Rare CD, V-Rare number 5, which I don't get because once they mass produce the CD, it's not really rare anymore.

228
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:52,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

229
00:14:52,710 --> 00:15:04,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, well, some of the things that are going to be on it, obviously, is going to be the ability to make link data for DDR Extreme, which will be nice, because you'll be able to actually record data for all the songs instead of like half.

230
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:10,442
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, it's rumored to be that there's over 70 songs, including some from DDR Extreme.

231
00:15:12,304 --> 00:15:26,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Which means you're going to see Dynamite Rave, Downbird Soda Mix, Look to the Sky, True Colors Mix, Do It Right, the Harmonized Two-Set Mix, Drop the Bomb System FX Mix, and AM3P 303 Bass Mix.

232
00:15:26,231 --> 00:15:28,973
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's it from DDR Extreme.

233
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:32,855
[SPEAKER_09]: If they have La Copa de la Vida, I'll be so happy, because that's the best song ever.

234
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:37,784
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you don't understand.

235
00:15:38,245 --> 00:15:43,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I said it was like a foreign language until someone said Ricky Martin song.

236
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,673
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, that's what's coming out April 25th.

237
00:15:47,093 --> 00:15:48,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, discuss.

238
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:57,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I for one am super excited about this, except I'm fucking broke and I have to move next month.

239
00:15:57,462 --> 00:16:00,025
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I'll probably scrape some money out of the couch and buy it anyway.

240
00:16:00,652 --> 00:16:01,573
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay, you can play mine.

241
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:02,734
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be my birthday month.

242
00:16:02,814 --> 00:16:04,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, gee, I can come over and play.

243
00:16:04,155 --> 00:16:04,716
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great.

244
00:16:06,437 --> 00:16:08,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Like hell, we're gonna buy one, dammit!

245
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:14,544
[SPEAKER_10]: I was brought to you by... We're gonna buy one so I can rip the songs and put them on the internet and stuff.

246
00:16:15,145 --> 00:16:21,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the thing is, I don't know if Konami happens to, like, be spying on me, but every time a game comes out, my birthday's around there.

247
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:23,592
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just for you, man.

248
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:25,033
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just for me.

249
00:16:25,113 --> 00:16:26,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that an effect that you just released games in April and November?

250
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:28,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually blew the big money world.

251
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:31,790
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the tie into my life.

252
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,831
[SPEAKER_02]: And no to release games around my birthday.

253
00:16:33,971 --> 00:16:37,253
[SPEAKER_10]: DDR Max 2, USA, November.

254
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:38,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course.

255
00:16:40,035 --> 00:16:41,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Any idea what's going to be on that?

256
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:42,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they going to give us anything special?

257
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:48,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably just like, you know, same thing as last time, maybe some more new exclusive songs and whatnot.

258
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,702
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, nothing yet.

259
00:16:53,202 --> 00:16:55,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, we'll know more after E3.

260
00:16:56,143 --> 00:16:56,544
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.

261
00:16:57,264 --> 00:16:58,284
[SPEAKER_10]: If we can get into it.

262
00:16:58,524 --> 00:16:59,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

263
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:02,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Mel's got his hand raised.

264
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:02,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

265
00:17:03,126 --> 00:17:04,767
[SPEAKER_18]: That's because DDR Spot got the hookup.

266
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:05,547
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, whoa.

267
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't Orange Lounge get the hookup?

268
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:07,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what?

269
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:13,070
[SPEAKER_02]: People who are engaged to GameStop employees get the hookup.

270
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um...

271
00:17:20,563 --> 00:17:27,029
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, Jason Ninos actually hires a lot of DDR Spot, Beemaniacs, and other people to dance for him at the Boots.

272
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,350
[SPEAKER_18]: That's pretty much how we get our hookup.

273
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,712
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm extremely fashionable.

274
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:32,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that could, you know, go for something.

275
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:37,338
[SPEAKER_18]: You'd be surprised how everybody at E3 looks good for some reason or another.

276
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:39,200
[SPEAKER_02]: You could muddle a dance pad.

277
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,492
[SPEAKER_18]: I could be a dance pad.

278
00:17:41,992 --> 00:17:43,895
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, I won a dance pad at E3.

279
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:47,240
[SPEAKER_18]: I kicked everyone's ass at Britney's, like, dance beat.

280
00:17:48,102 --> 00:17:49,384
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah!

281
00:17:49,464 --> 00:17:50,645
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, there's my claim to fame.

282
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:50,986
[SPEAKER_04]: You're Billy's...

283
00:17:53,993 --> 00:17:55,174
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

284
00:18:13,673 --> 00:18:20,396
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, every brand name out there has a billboard the size of like a freaking street, you know, the street billboards.

285
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:25,958
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody looks good, not just the people who model off games, but like even the business exec women and guys.

286
00:18:25,998 --> 00:18:28,079
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, you know, it's like everyone's just all glass.

287
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:30,700
[SPEAKER_18]: There's celebrities that roll through there, like my boy Henry.

288
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,501
[SPEAKER_18]: He saw Robin Williams in there and got, you know, a picture with him.

289
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:37,682
[SPEAKER_18]: I almost was able to flag down Gary Coleman for an autograph, but he was in a rush.

290
00:18:38,062 --> 00:18:38,803
[SPEAKER_04]: What you talking about, Mel?

291
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:51,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Our friend Ryan goes there every year and brings back a videotape, but this last year he went and saw Bruce Campbell again and got Bruce Campbell to record his answering machine message.

292
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:54,587
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow, that's a serious hookup.

293
00:18:54,707 --> 00:19:04,551
[SPEAKER_18]: And yeah, other celebrities like at the THQ, I think it was, they had Stacey Kubler freaking like... Bruce Campbell on the goddamn radio show.

294
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:07,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, Bruce Campbell on the goddamn radio show!

295
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:13,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, just tell me who I have to blow to get in the door and we're there, okay?

296
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:17,424
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, I didn't want to cut off your story.

297
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:19,585
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, pretty much E3 is just a blast.

298
00:19:19,645 --> 00:19:23,308
[SPEAKER_18]: And not only do you just see what's new, it's all about the free stuff, man.

299
00:19:23,348 --> 00:19:26,851
[SPEAKER_18]: It's all about just nabbing posters, friggin' demo discs.

300
00:19:26,871 --> 00:19:29,213
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it your fourth?

301
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:29,814
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it your fourth year?

302
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:35,145
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to cut in really fast because Billy the Big Homo has to go but I wanted to ask him if he has any final thoughts.

303
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:55,263
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

304
00:19:56,164 --> 00:19:56,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Not even one?

305
00:19:57,184 --> 00:19:57,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Not even one.

306
00:19:58,365 --> 00:19:59,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Song lyric, maybe?

307
00:19:59,526 --> 00:20:00,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Final thoughts, is this like Jerry Springer?

308
00:20:00,586 --> 00:20:01,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I just can't get you out of my head.

309
00:20:03,928 --> 00:20:04,829
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all I think about.

310
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:05,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, get out of here.

311
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:05,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

312
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye, Billy, thank you.

313
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, oh hell yeah, later.

314
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:11,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you guys are going too?

315
00:20:11,773 --> 00:20:12,293
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.

316
00:20:12,913 --> 00:20:13,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, where's Anita?

317
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:14,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring Anita in here.

318
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:18,196
[SPEAKER_21]: It's suddenly become the goodbye show.

319
00:20:18,236 --> 00:20:21,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, this is like, it's the, oh my god, who walks into the studio next show?

320
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:24,140
[SPEAKER_04]: It's DDRholic, ladies and gentlemen, say hello.

321
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:25,487
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, everybody.

322
00:20:25,527 --> 00:20:25,987
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you?

323
00:20:26,568 --> 00:20:27,689
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you doing in town today?

324
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,631
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, I'm moving in.

325
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:30,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Here?

326
00:20:30,972 --> 00:20:31,633
[SPEAKER_04]: You're moving in here?

327
00:20:31,653 --> 00:20:35,637
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I'm moving in with Ryan and Johnny.

328
00:20:37,338 --> 00:20:38,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hello.

329
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:43,965
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know you're kind of in and out, but do you have any final thoughts for the radio show or anything you want to say?

330
00:20:44,005 --> 00:20:44,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Any shout-outs?

331
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:46,052
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see.

332
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:47,012
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

333
00:20:47,953 --> 00:20:49,493
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know too many people anymore.

334
00:20:50,113 --> 00:20:54,975
[SPEAKER_19]: Shoutouts to all the DDR people out there who love DDR and all the money.

335
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:56,395
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

336
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:57,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Well put.

337
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:57,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

338
00:20:58,036 --> 00:20:58,276
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

339
00:20:58,296 --> 00:20:58,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

340
00:20:58,836 --> 00:20:59,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Be safe.

341
00:20:59,376 --> 00:20:59,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good move.

342
00:21:00,316 --> 00:21:00,656
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

343
00:21:05,838 --> 00:21:06,138
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

344
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,920
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be able to get E3 tickets because we have word in the industry, right?

345
00:21:12,941 --> 00:21:33,319
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, probably the best thing to do is just talk to Jason Enos, you know, because he gets, you know, for all his pull, he gets a lot of guest passes, so if nothing else, you may not get, like, the perks of media, which means you get to have, like, exclusive use of, like, say, you get media guides and, like, kits and all that stuff, but you still get to go around and go everywhere else, you just don't get to go inside, like, behind the wall and get free food, but... Oh, well, bummer.

346
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,742
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, you'll take what you get and you'll like it.

347
00:21:40,214 --> 00:21:42,515
[SPEAKER_04]: My god, I feel like there's a party going on in the hallway.

348
00:21:42,615 --> 00:21:48,177
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've received tickets to your home address once, you will always receive tickets.

349
00:21:48,637 --> 00:21:51,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you are no longer in the industry, you will always receive tickets.

350
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:58,581
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, I got my thing in the mail about two months ago saying, yeah, re-register for E3.

351
00:21:58,661 --> 00:21:59,961
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm like, hell yeah.

352
00:22:03,062 --> 00:22:04,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, bye.

353
00:22:04,663 --> 00:22:05,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Now who's leaving?

354
00:22:08,074 --> 00:22:09,075
[SPEAKER_04]: What is E3?

355
00:22:09,635 --> 00:22:14,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering if I could use one of my old paychecks from Cyber Station.

356
00:22:14,841 --> 00:22:16,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I used to work for Namco.

357
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:18,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, my paycheck says Namco.

358
00:22:18,444 --> 00:22:26,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave just asked you a question of the hour, which is actually kind of funny because a lot of people may actually not know this, and here we are sitting talking around about E3.

359
00:22:26,091 --> 00:22:27,613
[SPEAKER_04]: What exactly is E3 for those who don't know?

360
00:22:28,804 --> 00:22:30,104
[SPEAKER_18]: Electronic Entertainment Expo.

361
00:22:31,065 --> 00:22:32,285
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that goes on in LA.

362
00:22:32,325 --> 00:22:39,067
[SPEAKER_18]: Basically, it's the big Albie of all video games, computer entertainment and such.

363
00:22:39,747 --> 00:22:41,107
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Vegas in a nutshell.

364
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:43,048
[SPEAKER_18]: It's every geek's dream to go up in there.

365
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:44,588
[SPEAKER_02]: And fan service for the guys.

366
00:22:45,348 --> 00:22:47,949
[SPEAKER_02]: And some lesbians.

367
00:22:48,689 --> 00:22:52,250
[SPEAKER_04]: It's when all the big game companies get together to show off their new toys.

368
00:22:53,871 --> 00:22:55,471
[SPEAKER_04]: They had Xena there a couple years ago, didn't they?

369
00:22:55,491 --> 00:22:55,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

370
00:22:56,272 --> 00:22:58,253
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, everybody's up in there.

371
00:23:05,257 --> 00:23:09,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Just walk up to him, behind him, you know, my neck, my back, my pussy, and my crack.

372
00:23:14,243 --> 00:23:15,083
I just want to go.

373
00:23:15,183 --> 00:23:16,544
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to go.

374
00:23:17,044 --> 00:23:18,545
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to go to this.

375
00:23:19,045 --> 00:23:21,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I don't like my work and I'd rather go instead.

376
00:23:23,953 --> 00:23:26,975
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

377
00:23:48,949 --> 00:23:54,115
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of the people who've been, like, just working their way up, finally get to the top or get some recognition.

378
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:56,077
[SPEAKER_18]: It was cool for them, definitely.

379
00:23:56,157 --> 00:24:00,542
[SPEAKER_18]: I was happy to see, I guess, what a lot of people are referring to as the torch being passed.

380
00:24:00,562 --> 00:24:05,508
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, it's like the old schools kind of, like, making way for the newer, the new jacks, the new generation.

381
00:24:06,068 --> 00:24:11,433
[SPEAKER_18]: and I'm totally fine because most people out there like Bruce Lee or AJ and such, they've busted themselves pretty hard.

382
00:24:11,593 --> 00:24:13,575
[SPEAKER_18]: It's good to see them get some recognition for a change.

383
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:14,936
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I wanted some.

384
00:24:14,976 --> 00:24:17,819
[SPEAKER_18]: I want a slice of the pie, but it was cool.

385
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:20,641
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm glad people still like to see me out there and whatever.

386
00:24:21,622 --> 00:24:22,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool, cool deal.

387
00:24:22,714 --> 00:24:26,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to ask you guys, Shark Scroll, I know you are huge on the Derby Owners Club.

388
00:24:27,736 --> 00:24:29,356
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm trying to break myself of it.

389
00:24:29,396 --> 00:24:32,077
[SPEAKER_21]: I haven't played it since the last time you were in the Bay.

390
00:24:32,257 --> 00:24:35,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, I was going to ask if you went to that tournament that they had at Milpitas.

391
00:24:35,598 --> 00:24:40,040
[SPEAKER_21]: I kind of didn't even realize it was happening because I thought it was the following week.

392
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,481
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you been up to lately then, girl?

393
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:43,121
[SPEAKER_21]: Work.

394
00:24:43,861 --> 00:24:47,683
[SPEAKER_21]: I see Mel B and then I go to sleep and that's about damn near it.

395
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:49,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, gotta do what you gotta do.

396
00:24:49,543 --> 00:24:51,484
[SPEAKER_21]: Work sucks for the record, but that's okay.

397
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,073
[SPEAKER_18]: On a side note, Oki actually won the Derby Owners Club.

398
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,413
[SPEAKER_04]: How the hell did that happen?

399
00:24:56,654 --> 00:24:58,195
[SPEAKER_18]: I coached him in the final match.

400
00:24:59,796 --> 00:25:02,718
[SPEAKER_18]: See, Ross actually was kicking a lot of ass.

401
00:25:02,758 --> 00:25:07,941
[SPEAKER_18]: He had the most wins and had the most money, but the last match was a G1, which is like the big high stakes.

402
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:14,445
[SPEAKER_18]: And then Oki was just asking me for advice, and I'm like, do this right here, hold the horse right there, whip it right there, bam, wasn't even close.

403
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's pretty cool.

404
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:19,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't Derby Owners Club kind of handicap you if you're behind or something, though?

405
00:25:20,504 --> 00:25:21,585
[SPEAKER_21]: Only in one certain race.

406
00:25:22,965 --> 00:25:25,767
[SPEAKER_21]: But everything else is skill of the player.

407
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder how well Politary would have done.

408
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:32,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because the last time I raced, I remember Politary won like her second race.

409
00:25:32,651 --> 00:25:33,571
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was actually racing.

410
00:25:33,611 --> 00:25:35,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I was racing Ross in that one.

411
00:25:35,172 --> 00:25:35,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

412
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:37,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I was racing some of the better players.

413
00:25:37,293 --> 00:25:37,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And I won.

414
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:38,994
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, how the hell did I win that?

415
00:25:39,014 --> 00:25:39,574
[SPEAKER_04]: My horse sucks.

416
00:25:39,614 --> 00:25:41,615
[SPEAKER_04]: And somebody was telling me, oh, well, they handicap it.

417
00:25:41,756 --> 00:25:43,516
[SPEAKER_21]: And I still have the picture.

418
00:25:43,797 --> 00:25:46,418
[SPEAKER_21]: I still have the picture that says Politary is very happy.

419
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Politary the horse rules.

420
00:25:51,792 --> 00:25:53,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, hot man sex still rules.

421
00:25:55,449 --> 00:25:55,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

422
00:25:56,977 --> 00:26:06,099
[SPEAKER_04]: So, alright, how about we take a quick break, and then we come back, and we're going to do the FUs of the week, before the people have to go, because I know we certainly have a lot of angst.

423
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:09,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're going to have another three hour long FU segment.

424
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:10,520
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is what we'll do.

425
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody in the studio can FU as much as they want, but everybody in the chatroom will limit to like three FUs.

426
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:21,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so chatroom, send your FUs on to me over private message, but three at the most, because we don't want this to go on forever.

427
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:23,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so...

428
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:38,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so yeah, we're going to... Did somebody turn the mic off?

429
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

430
00:26:40,751 --> 00:26:42,292
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the other line.

431
00:26:42,332 --> 00:26:42,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Beep.

432
00:26:43,512 --> 00:26:45,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sorry, we had to take a call on the other line.

433
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:51,215
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go to... I used to do that when we had a phone that had a pause that would mute the line.

434
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:56,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I would tap it, and people thought I had a call waiting, so if I got tired of talking to them, I'd do it.

435
00:26:56,857 --> 00:26:58,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, that was for my grandmother.

436
00:26:58,118 --> 00:26:58,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to let you go.

437
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:10,248
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool when you have the mute button and you just push it and see how long it takes people to actually think you hung up on us.

438
00:27:11,128 --> 00:27:11,769
[SPEAKER_04]: You're mean.

439
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:20,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, if you missed it, FUs of the Week are coming up next, but you're limited to three in the chat room just because we're trying to make it under an hour long this week.

440
00:27:20,496 --> 00:27:24,700
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we'll be right back after this quick break.

441
00:28:35,555 --> 00:28:36,640
Thanks for watching!

442
00:31:09,282 --> 00:31:11,350
[SPEAKER_14]: and more, you can't stop my shittin', what you gettin'?

443
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:11,953
[SPEAKER_14]: Hell yeah, man!

444
00:31:41,704 --> 00:31:42,925
You got to bring your mind

445
00:32:26,855 --> 00:32:28,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

446
00:32:28,836 --> 00:32:31,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Bongo demands it.

447
00:32:32,699 --> 00:32:35,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, we're back.

448
00:32:35,181 --> 00:32:37,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they were talking in the chat room about 1998.

449
00:32:37,543 --> 00:32:39,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like every other Naoki song that's been made, they're saying.

450
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:41,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like D2R and everything else.

451
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like that one because I like the background.

452
00:32:43,867 --> 00:32:46,069
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really easy to PA, I think.

453
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:46,669
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I like it.

454
00:32:46,689 --> 00:32:47,730
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I want to say?

455
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:48,010
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

456
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,352
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say is, where's 2MB?

457
00:32:50,732 --> 00:32:52,393
[SPEAKER_10]: We need some more 2MB remixes.

458
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:53,654
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Trip Machine Survivor?

459
00:32:54,468 --> 00:32:55,229
[SPEAKER_10]: That's on 2MB.

460
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:55,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't it?

461
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,290
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

462
00:32:56,611 --> 00:32:57,852
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just Desire.

463
00:32:58,553 --> 00:32:59,714
[SPEAKER_10]: We need 2MB.

464
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:03,219
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what the next song that's going to get the 2MB treatment is going to be fucking Bag.

465
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:04,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Bag sucks ass.

466
00:33:05,561 --> 00:33:07,664
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to make a trans version of Bag.

467
00:33:08,665 --> 00:33:09,646
[SPEAKER_04]: The Legend of Bag.

468
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:11,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the Legend of Haggis.

469
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,231
[SPEAKER_10]: They already have the Legend of Bag sucks.

470
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:13,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they really?

471
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

472
00:33:15,734 --> 00:33:18,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, the worst fucking remix I heard this week, okay?

473
00:33:19,378 --> 00:33:23,403
[SPEAKER_10]: The Legend of Max 300, or Max Unlimited 300, or something like that.

474
00:33:23,843 --> 00:33:25,425
[SPEAKER_10]: It is not even a remix.

475
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:32,193
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, okay, let's just stop it, start playing Max 300, stop it again, start... It didn't even sound... It's not a remix.

476
00:33:32,273 --> 00:33:32,934
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just awful.

477
00:33:32,954 --> 00:33:33,915
[SPEAKER_10]: And people are like, oh, cool!

478
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,422
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I haven't heard Climax.

479
00:33:37,843 --> 00:33:38,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, read in the chat room.

480
00:33:38,865 --> 00:33:40,789
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're not in our chat room, you should join it.

481
00:33:40,829 --> 00:33:45,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go to our website, orangelounge.skie.cx and click on chat.

482
00:33:46,966 --> 00:33:48,247
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear she's like a cancer.

483
00:34:10,237 --> 00:34:13,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say, to her credit, lately she's been able to hold a key.

484
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:17,021
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's just because someone's been beating her over the head more and more.

485
00:34:17,442 --> 00:34:23,145
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, for anyone who's ever been in band, you can buy an instrument and it can be built out of tune.

486
00:34:23,486 --> 00:34:25,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that Politary has been built out of tune.

487
00:34:25,827 --> 00:34:28,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So they did what they do with some instruments and beat them into shape.

488
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:31,305
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Brad would be so mad at you right now.

489
00:34:45,157 --> 00:34:47,099
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that machine in Josie and the Pussycats?

490
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,982
[SPEAKER_04]: The one, the big machine they had that would make them all in tune?

491
00:34:51,562 --> 00:34:52,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the Mr. Movie Phone, there was something else.

492
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:55,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they had the subliminal messages from Mr. Movie Phone, you know?

493
00:34:56,286 --> 00:34:57,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Purple is the new orange.

494
00:34:59,028 --> 00:35:02,231
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, he's talking about that machine that, you know, you can sing out of key and sing in key.

495
00:35:02,251 --> 00:35:04,092
[SPEAKER_18]: That's probably how you got 100 points for that.

496
00:35:04,112 --> 00:35:05,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, hey, hey, I don't like where you're going with that, mister.

497
00:35:06,254 --> 00:35:07,115
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like where you're going with that.

498
00:35:08,695 --> 00:35:10,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually, you know what, maybe I can find it later.

499
00:35:10,716 --> 00:35:14,478
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I couldn't play it during the actual show, but I do have Irene and I. I taped Irene and I singing Boys.

500
00:35:15,138 --> 00:35:15,838
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember.

501
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,159
[SPEAKER_02]: We got 100 on it, too.

502
00:35:17,259 --> 00:35:36,968
[SPEAKER_02]: One day at Rob's little apartment in Roseville, when I had laryngitis, Rob standing tall while everyone was sitting, with his hand to his side, diva-style singing that I'm like a bird song, with his eyes skyward, and I'm sitting here going, God damn, I'm glad I have laryngitis.

503
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:46,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a very vivid memory of just this, like Rob's on stage with a spotlight on him and he's got a feather bullet.

504
00:35:47,893 --> 00:35:49,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's going to be DDR Idol.

505
00:35:50,796 --> 00:35:55,220
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually I am not participating in DDR Idol, but I have a brother who is.

506
00:35:56,561 --> 00:35:58,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Spanky.

507
00:35:59,444 --> 00:36:01,106
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to be a judge.

508
00:36:01,997 --> 00:36:04,918
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we already have the judges for DDR Idol, I guess, what's going on.

509
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:07,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's talk March Madness.

510
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:09,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to go ahead and say one thing.

511
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,042
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that any of us from Sackboy Money are doing is admin work.

512
00:36:14,982 --> 00:36:18,184
[SPEAKER_02]: And running the 2DX portion of the tournament.

513
00:36:18,204 --> 00:36:19,504
[SPEAKER_04]: 2DX tourney is going to rock, by the way.

514
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:20,605
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be pretty intricate.

515
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:24,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Rules will be posted within the next few days, possibly as soon as tomorrow.

516
00:36:25,246 --> 00:36:26,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be cool.

517
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you guys will like it.

518
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:28,848
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are coming from out of town to do it.

519
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:35,453
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as Perfect Attack goes, there's rules posted on DDRSpot.com, DDRFreak, in the tournament forum.

520
00:36:36,915 --> 00:36:39,576
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be on Sack of Imani as soon as we get the site up.

521
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:44,320
[SPEAKER_02]: As we all look at Loki.

522
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:48,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll throw something together then.

523
00:36:48,663 --> 00:36:52,045
[SPEAKER_09]: You have any answering questions and then beating people with bats?

524
00:36:53,146 --> 00:36:55,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, you know, I'm thinking about auctioning off my bat.

525
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what's this about you're going to put your bat on the new DDR Freak Marketplace or something?

526
00:37:00,703 --> 00:37:06,366
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just going to go around and hit people in the head with it and go, Hi, you've been deemed by, you know, some of the most famous people in the big money world.

527
00:37:07,447 --> 00:37:09,008
[SPEAKER_02]: At least they've been seen.

528
00:37:09,028 --> 00:37:12,050
[SPEAKER_02]: You've already, you actually hit yourself with a bat.

529
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, question for Loki from the chat room, and I already think I know the answer.

530
00:37:16,072 --> 00:37:20,895
[SPEAKER_04]: But, apparently the rumor is you can triple A Fuhurata's theme.

531
00:37:21,276 --> 00:37:21,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that true?

532
00:37:23,057 --> 00:37:23,297
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

533
00:37:23,317 --> 00:37:23,517
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

534
00:37:24,312 --> 00:37:27,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody in the chat room is asking if you can triple-A Fuhurata Steam, Ninzaburro.

535
00:37:28,194 --> 00:37:28,494
[SPEAKER_04]: No?

536
00:37:29,995 --> 00:37:31,555
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't triple-A shit, man.

537
00:37:31,615 --> 00:37:33,316
[SPEAKER_10]: I totally suck at PA.

538
00:37:33,396 --> 00:37:35,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody claims they played DDR with you and you triple-A'd it.

539
00:37:37,038 --> 00:37:37,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay!

540
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:40,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish I was there because I only played doubles.

541
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,001
[SPEAKER_02]: So how much drugs were these people doing?

542
00:37:44,021 --> 00:37:45,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

543
00:37:45,822 --> 00:37:49,864
[SPEAKER_10]: I only played doubles, and if I triple-A'd that, I mean, that would be pretty sweet, but no.

544
00:37:50,124 --> 00:37:51,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have triple-A'd it on basic.

545
00:37:54,259 --> 00:37:58,400
[SPEAKER_10]: I've double A'd Rhythm and Police on my new pads that suck.

546
00:37:59,500 --> 00:37:59,880
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

547
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,140
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what fucking sucks?

548
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, one great on all these EX songs.

549
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:05,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't get my fucking triple A on Heavy.

550
00:38:05,841 --> 00:38:07,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I always get one fucking great.

551
00:38:08,322 --> 00:38:09,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that brings me around to the FUs.

552
00:38:10,782 --> 00:38:12,162
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't even get one great.

553
00:38:12,462 --> 00:38:14,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Five is my best, I think.

554
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:16,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to Marsh Madness.

555
00:38:16,983 --> 00:38:17,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hi, yes.

556
00:38:17,563 --> 00:38:18,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Fourth mix?

557
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, the guy's in Iowa, so that's a really good question.

558
00:38:26,085 --> 00:38:28,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Where was I in Iowa?

559
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,212
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually turning into a pretty good story.

560
00:38:36,008 --> 00:38:37,469
[SPEAKER_02]: On the dream plane, no.

561
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:39,589
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, back to March Madness.

562
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:40,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

563
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:44,051
[SPEAKER_02]: The dates for the tournament are March 29th, March 30th.

564
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:46,072
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be at Scandia in Sacramento.

565
00:38:47,052 --> 00:38:48,513
[SPEAKER_02]: There's addresses, there's directions.

566
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:51,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's going to be posted in one form or another.

567
00:38:53,354 --> 00:38:56,315
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to be giving updates throughout.

568
00:38:56,716 --> 00:38:59,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we were saying, we should have rules for the 2DX tournament posted this week.

569
00:39:00,557 --> 00:39:03,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be fun, right?

570
00:39:03,979 --> 00:39:04,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

571
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:04,980
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be fun.

572
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:05,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun.

573
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,481
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be exciting.

574
00:39:06,801 --> 00:39:07,682
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll definitely be exciting.

575
00:39:08,382 --> 00:39:10,784
[SPEAKER_02]: It will make people's heart race.

576
00:39:11,304 --> 00:39:12,705
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll bring a couple of thrills.

577
00:39:13,246 --> 00:39:13,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

578
00:39:14,707 --> 00:39:18,049
[SPEAKER_18]: And I still want my home run derby tournament for March Madness.

579
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,130
[SPEAKER_02]: We are actually working on that.

580
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:28,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually did leave the suggestion for doing the... We didn't get to talk about it in depth, but I did leave the suggestion for... This is the bummer.

581
00:39:28,336 --> 00:39:30,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, bang a ball for dollars.

582
00:39:30,397 --> 00:39:30,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

583
00:39:32,077 --> 00:39:38,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I had suggested that we possibly at Scandia have bumper boats at Scandia, that we have a wet t-shirt contest in the bumper boats.

584
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,674
[SPEAKER_04]: However, unfortunately, they can't do that.

585
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:42,136
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a family environment.

586
00:39:42,397 --> 00:39:42,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Because...

587
00:39:45,422 --> 00:39:46,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I work there, okay?

588
00:39:46,903 --> 00:39:49,425
[SPEAKER_05]: You got the inside on the bumper boats, alright?

589
00:39:49,585 --> 00:39:52,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I can make that happen, trust me.

590
00:39:52,868 --> 00:39:59,352
[SPEAKER_05]: My co-workers would probably, in fact, you know, enter a couple people they know in the contest.

591
00:39:59,392 --> 00:40:00,753
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm totally serious, too.

592
00:40:01,574 --> 00:40:02,194
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the problem.

593
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:10,941
[SPEAKER_04]: From what I told, a big radio station here in Sacramento, the Rock Station in Sacramento, did a big... As I hear the grunt from the former intern...

594
00:40:12,862 --> 00:40:15,884
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the better one, not the one that plays the Sublime song every six songs.

595
00:40:15,984 --> 00:40:17,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Mommy, mommy, I saw boobies!

596
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Dad's going to park his car in your garage.

597
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:47,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would you go run home and tell your mom?

598
00:40:47,918 --> 00:40:49,619
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, Mom, look, I saw boobies.

599
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't tell your mom that.

600
00:40:52,681 --> 00:41:02,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Since I used to be the intern there, I'll tell you right now, 95% of the contests they have are all horrible ideas, just like that one, because they don't ever think of what can happen.

601
00:41:02,987 --> 00:41:07,549
[SPEAKER_06]: They just think of what's going to get the most 40-year-old dirty guys out there.

602
00:41:07,629 --> 00:41:08,329
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all it is.

603
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the people doing it in the church?

604
00:41:14,574 --> 00:41:15,415
[SPEAKER_10]: That was good radio.

605
00:41:17,176 --> 00:41:22,621
[SPEAKER_02]: So what, can we go, like, hire people to go to the Presbyterian church down the road and go, hey, hey.

606
00:41:23,277 --> 00:41:29,319
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is going to be interesting, though, because we will be broadcasting, Orange Islands Radio will be broadcasting live all day long, both days.

607
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,340
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have a lot of help this time.

608
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,521
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not leaving one person in control.

609
00:41:32,541 --> 00:41:33,821
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to be constrained in the corner.

610
00:41:33,881 --> 00:41:34,761
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is going to be great.

611
00:41:34,941 --> 00:41:35,962
[SPEAKER_02]: That was your trial by fire.

612
00:41:36,002 --> 00:41:42,324
[SPEAKER_04]: If things work out like we're hoping, Orange Islands Radio is going to have its own little freaking temple that day.

613
00:41:42,384 --> 00:41:43,205
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be awesome.

614
00:41:43,305 --> 00:41:44,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I get a squirt gun to shoot people with?

615
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:45,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

616
00:41:45,766 --> 00:41:45,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

617
00:41:47,386 --> 00:41:48,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a squirt gun that looks like an Uzi.

618
00:41:51,368 --> 00:41:51,568
[SPEAKER_03]: March...

619
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:56,672
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it actually is just a water gun, but it looks exactly like a doozy.

620
00:41:56,692 --> 00:42:01,175
[SPEAKER_02]: It was part of my Jill Valentine costume for Resident Evil AX.

621
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:07,078
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I played DDR was dressed as Jill Valentine on a DDR machine.

622
00:42:07,118 --> 00:42:08,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you play Silent Hill?

623
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:09,760
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

624
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:14,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, my first song that I ever played on third mix was Xanadu.

625
00:42:14,442 --> 00:42:14,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

626
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:15,423
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Dynamite Rave.

627
00:42:21,135 --> 00:42:21,855
[SPEAKER_02]: and Army Boots.

628
00:42:21,935 --> 00:42:26,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Never play Dynamite Raven Army Boots, by the way, especially ones that aren't broken in.

629
00:42:26,517 --> 00:42:27,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, 23rd Magus has a zing here.

630
00:42:28,177 --> 00:42:29,998
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be broadcasting from the Temple of Butt.

631
00:42:32,139 --> 00:42:33,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Come inside the Temple of Butt.

632
00:42:34,399 --> 00:42:36,100
[SPEAKER_04]: We should hang a little sign.

633
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,061
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too bad Scandia is the family fun center.

634
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:40,361
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll have to be the Temple of Gutius Maximus.

635
00:42:40,381 --> 00:42:41,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, what are we going to do?

636
00:42:41,121 --> 00:42:41,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Barbecued fried clams?

637
00:42:48,382 --> 00:42:48,562
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh!

638
00:42:49,924 --> 00:42:50,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

639
00:42:51,726 --> 00:42:51,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

640
00:42:51,927 --> 00:42:52,367
[SPEAKER_22]: Y'all are dirty!

641
00:42:56,232 --> 00:42:58,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, 100 tacos ain't enough to feed RTF by themselves, man.

642
00:43:23,588 --> 00:43:25,089
[SPEAKER_04]: 100 tacos ain't enough to feed Mike Ngo.

643
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:26,290
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you guys talking about?

644
00:43:28,332 --> 00:43:39,742
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but seriously, March Madness, it kind of, like everybody was expecting there to be a March Madness this year, and everybody was kind of looking out for it, but at the same time, it literally seems to have come out of nowhere, and it's rapidly snowballing, festering, getting huge.

645
00:43:40,022 --> 00:43:41,323
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be like this huge event.

646
00:43:41,383 --> 00:43:43,005
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be the biggest thing in NorCal Intel B3.

647
00:43:44,406 --> 00:43:46,908
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you guys have to come if you're in the area.

648
00:43:46,948 --> 00:43:51,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say anything officially on this yet, but keep your eyes on all the boards.

649
00:43:51,752 --> 00:43:52,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep listening to us.

650
00:43:53,073 --> 00:43:55,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there might be a little bit more to this tournament.

651
00:43:55,876 --> 00:43:57,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you talking about the Power Station bit?

652
00:43:57,557 --> 00:44:00,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that has been officially announced.

653
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,541
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a twist greater than Joe Millionaire!

654
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:03,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Look out!

655
00:44:03,802 --> 00:44:05,984
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an all-new tournament.

656
00:44:06,024 --> 00:44:06,564
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a twist.

657
00:44:06,725 --> 00:44:10,688
[SPEAKER_02]: This tournament is also going to serve as qualifiers for that other one.

658
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:17,354
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to serve as qualifiers for the big Power Station tournament, which is this chain of arcades, I believe, and maybe you know a little more about this, Mel?

659
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:17,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

660
00:44:18,115 --> 00:44:21,038
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there's going to be somewhere around three qualifiers, I believe.

661
00:44:21,098 --> 00:44:26,102
[SPEAKER_18]: Two in SoCal, I think one in Fresno, maybe two in SoCal, one in NorCal, just of course being the first.

662
00:44:26,362 --> 00:44:28,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's going to be an invite-only contest.

663
00:44:28,644 --> 00:44:35,490
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I believe top three from each competition will be invited to the big power station for a thousand bucks in prizes or like more.

664
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:36,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we do have a twist.

665
00:44:36,851 --> 00:44:40,213
[SPEAKER_04]: At March Madness, ladies and gentlemen, top six will be qualifying.

666
00:44:40,313 --> 00:44:45,918
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you want a good chance of qualifying... I think I'd better get on the bus then.

667
00:44:46,018 --> 00:44:47,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this for PA or something?

668
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:48,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Freestyle.

669
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Freestyle.

670
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:50,101
[SPEAKER_02]: And PA.

671
00:44:50,402 --> 00:44:51,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you've got to enter PA, Dave.

672
00:44:51,602 --> 00:44:53,204
[SPEAKER_04]: You might qualify for the power station.

673
00:44:53,244 --> 00:44:55,606
[SPEAKER_04]: You can walk away with fabulous cash and prizes.

674
00:44:56,466 --> 00:44:56,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh boy!

675
00:44:59,325 --> 00:45:00,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if a fourth mix is giving away.

676
00:45:00,826 --> 00:45:03,106
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't enter the 2DX tournament, I'm going to kick you.

677
00:45:05,307 --> 00:45:06,647
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm not good at 2DX.

678
00:45:07,568 --> 00:45:09,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Brad and DJ Syndrome are good.

679
00:45:09,968 --> 00:45:10,928
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Syndrome can't enter.

680
00:45:10,948 --> 00:45:12,129
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Syndrome is helping us run it.

681
00:45:13,989 --> 00:45:15,130
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you going to enter?

682
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:16,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Fine.

683
00:45:19,171 --> 00:45:19,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

684
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:22,929
[SPEAKER_10]: They were asking me if I was going to enter.

685
00:45:23,749 --> 00:45:24,970
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a chuckle out of that one.

686
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:28,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there might be incentive for even the bad people to be entering.

687
00:45:28,572 --> 00:45:30,553
[SPEAKER_04]: The people who don't consider themselves good at 2DX.

688
00:45:30,573 --> 00:45:32,094
[SPEAKER_04]: There's even incentive for you guys to enter.

689
00:45:32,114 --> 00:45:32,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even play 2DX.

690
00:45:32,874 --> 00:45:33,935
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a surprise.

691
00:45:34,935 --> 00:45:39,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I look like a fucking retard going, NERD BUTTONS!

692
00:45:40,758 --> 00:45:41,338
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funny?

693
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:43,680
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the way the 2DX machine is at Scandia right now.

694
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,300
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how the buttons light up and they flash?

695
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:47,962
[SPEAKER_04]: On the one-player side, the two-key...

696
00:45:48,826 --> 00:45:50,407
[SPEAKER_04]: and the six key are burned out.

697
00:45:50,487 --> 00:45:52,247
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have the four on the bottom and then the middle one.

698
00:45:52,267 --> 00:45:53,347
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a giant middle finger.

699
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:57,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you have these four ones on the bottom and then one that's kind of raised up above the others.

700
00:45:57,269 --> 00:45:58,109
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of cool.

701
00:45:58,909 --> 00:46:01,670
[SPEAKER_02]: And little does everybody know, but all the right side players had a hand in that.

702
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:04,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

703
00:46:04,151 --> 00:46:04,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Right side pride.

704
00:46:05,771 --> 00:46:06,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

705
00:46:06,471 --> 00:46:07,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

706
00:46:07,992 --> 00:46:08,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

707
00:46:09,672 --> 00:46:11,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I the only one that plays left side in here?

708
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:11,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

709
00:46:12,033 --> 00:46:12,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.

710
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:13,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.

711
00:46:13,553 --> 00:46:14,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm outnumbered.

712
00:46:17,225 --> 00:46:18,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not the cheese, I'm the princess.

713
00:46:18,665 --> 00:46:19,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyway.

714
00:46:21,046 --> 00:46:22,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also a model and an actress.

715
00:46:23,426 --> 00:46:25,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also a model and an actress, so fuck you too.

716
00:46:26,107 --> 00:46:32,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, Black Lab says, and he's making a pretty big claim here, Black Lab is going to enter Perfect Attack and beat Tigger.

717
00:46:33,068 --> 00:46:35,708
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't say he's going to win, he just says he's going to beat Tigger.

718
00:46:37,049 --> 00:46:38,069
[SPEAKER_18]: We need this on film.

719
00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:39,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Puppy's making a call.

720
00:46:39,549 --> 00:46:44,910
[SPEAKER_18]: And sadly enough, about 90% of the whole world is kind of, you know, hoping that would happen too.

721
00:46:45,774 --> 00:46:46,534
[SPEAKER_04]: No offense, Tigger.

722
00:46:46,654 --> 00:46:47,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Good guy.

723
00:46:47,215 --> 00:46:48,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, goddammit, lose for once.

724
00:46:49,416 --> 00:46:51,917
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I still got giddy when you beat me.

725
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,380
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to be humble about that because I know it was a luck.

726
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,280
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just total luck.

727
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,221
[SPEAKER_04]: One great, it was luck.

728
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:01,901
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

729
00:47:01,961 --> 00:47:04,663
[SPEAKER_09]: I only lost to Tigger by like 32 greats.

730
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:06,243
[SPEAKER_09]: I was close.

731
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:11,506
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like, you know, fingers, toes, fingers, and a couple toes.

732
00:47:13,281 --> 00:47:17,443
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we were playing Can't Stop Falling In Love, Speed Mix, and he got like 9, and I got like 40.

733
00:47:18,604 --> 00:47:20,705
[SPEAKER_09]: It was close, but he had it by a little bit.

734
00:47:21,065 --> 00:47:21,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Next time.

735
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:27,429
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just for the fun of it, I think that even I would enter this if I wasn't running half of it.

736
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:29,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I would enter this contest.

737
00:47:30,511 --> 00:47:34,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I know somebody that's going to be entering, and I'm helping this person train.

738
00:47:34,493 --> 00:47:36,334
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I'm pretty close, too.

739
00:47:36,894 --> 00:47:37,955
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we'll see what happens.

740
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:41,237
[SPEAKER_04]: But this person will be entering DDR Idol, and it will be fabulous.

741
00:47:41,277 --> 00:47:41,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I guarantee it.

742
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:43,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah.

743
00:47:43,949 --> 00:47:44,810
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyway.

744
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:46,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we want to do the FUs of the week?

745
00:47:47,011 --> 00:47:48,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

746
00:47:48,512 --> 00:47:49,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I need angst.

747
00:47:49,813 --> 00:47:52,915
[SPEAKER_04]: We need you to explain the FUs of the week because we have some new folks listening.

748
00:47:52,935 --> 00:47:53,876
[SPEAKER_02]: My God.

749
00:47:55,077 --> 00:47:57,619
[SPEAKER_02]: How much do you have to explain what the fuck you mean?

750
00:47:57,659 --> 00:48:01,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Just give the brief rundown of the, Jamie, I'm going to do it for you, the fuck yous of the week.

751
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:02,903
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

752
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:03,963
[SPEAKER_02]: That made me happy.

753
00:48:04,724 --> 00:48:07,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, this is where we talk about stuff that pisses us off.

754
00:48:08,347 --> 00:48:08,727
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

755
00:48:09,187 --> 00:48:09,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Love, Jamie.

756
00:48:11,969 --> 00:48:14,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, then on that note, let's get to it!

757
00:48:21,678 --> 00:48:23,740
[SPEAKER_10]: This is fucked up!

758
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:29,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my first fucking leak goes toward people who drive slow in front of me.

759
00:48:30,086 --> 00:48:33,029
[SPEAKER_02]: As in, like, the grandma from earlier today.

760
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:37,573
[SPEAKER_02]: She had around her license tag, quilting keeps grandma off the road.

761
00:48:38,948 --> 00:48:39,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Why was she on the road?

762
00:48:40,088 --> 00:48:42,089
[SPEAKER_02]: And why was she taking off her wig in her car?

763
00:48:42,109 --> 00:48:45,629
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, oh, I'm driving 20 miles an hour.

764
00:48:45,649 --> 00:48:47,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take off my wig and scratch my head.

765
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:50,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, let me adjust.

766
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:50,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

767
00:48:51,351 --> 00:48:54,371
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have nothing against old people.

768
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Except the way they drive.

769
00:48:55,491 --> 00:48:58,132
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have things against old people who can't drive.

770
00:48:58,612 --> 00:49:08,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that when you reach like maybe 60 or so, you need to retake your full driving test to make sure that you are capable of operating your vehicle like the rest of the world.

771
00:49:09,688 --> 00:49:13,451
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing on the other part of the week is for speed limit.

772
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:16,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it like 40 just a suggestion?

773
00:49:17,134 --> 00:49:21,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everybody else who goes down El Camino or Arden goes 50 to 5.

774
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:23,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Fair Oaks in the morning on my way to work.

775
00:49:26,782 --> 00:49:29,985
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing goes toward the guy who sold us our car from the dealership.

776
00:49:30,446 --> 00:49:31,506
[SPEAKER_02]: I still don't have my title yet.

777
00:49:31,526 --> 00:49:33,948
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I can try to get my title.

778
00:49:34,149 --> 00:49:36,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I'm not in a train, so...

779
00:49:37,802 --> 00:49:46,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my other one goes toward, um, um, I forget.

780
00:49:46,231 --> 00:49:47,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Shermie for being a butt all weekend.

781
00:49:48,654 --> 00:49:49,035
[SPEAKER_02]: My cat.

782
00:49:49,495 --> 00:49:50,316
[SPEAKER_02]: My sweet baby.

783
00:49:50,656 --> 00:49:51,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's been a butt hole all weekend.

784
00:49:52,258 --> 00:49:53,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, she's been a butt hole to me, too.

785
00:49:54,941 --> 00:49:56,563
[SPEAKER_14]: And my other one goes toward...

786
00:49:57,965 --> 00:50:04,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, our Neo Geo for having cords that are not, like, working properly to get the sun cut out and set my shirt on, too.

787
00:50:05,414 --> 00:50:08,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, another one goes toward not having money.

788
00:50:09,498 --> 00:50:10,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm paying for my car.

789
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and a really big fuck you.

790
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,021
[SPEAKER_02]: And a few people know about this.

791
00:50:15,401 --> 00:50:19,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to apply for a position at my old job as internally posted.

792
00:50:19,842 --> 00:50:25,443
[SPEAKER_02]: And under the terms of my displacement, I am eligible to apply for this job until March 17th.

793
00:50:25,503 --> 00:50:30,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm still considered technically an employee of the company, just not officially.

794
00:50:31,025 --> 00:50:31,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a displaced employee.

795
00:50:32,785 --> 00:50:43,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Julie, who was kind enough to send in all the stuff for me, gets an email or a call or something from one of the HR people and says, No, she can't apply for this because she has dyslexia.

796
00:50:43,269 --> 00:50:45,630
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell, that completely contradicts my dyslexia.

797
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:47,570
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to call them and say this.

798
00:50:48,851 --> 00:50:55,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, if I can't apply for this job, then you need to create a position for me like you did with... I won't say her name.

799
00:50:55,765 --> 00:50:56,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all done.

800
00:51:21,707 --> 00:51:22,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't fuck with Jamie.

801
00:51:44,355 --> 00:51:48,279
[SPEAKER_02]: You make sure someone knows about it and you get it fixed because nothing changes until you make it change.

802
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,941
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to do something big enough to cover for those other eight people.

803
00:51:51,402 --> 00:51:51,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

804
00:51:52,163 --> 00:51:52,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

805
00:51:53,184 --> 00:51:56,767
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to do what I can to make sure those other people get off their asses and take care of the business.

806
00:51:57,367 --> 00:52:00,691
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't stand for that if I can help it.

807
00:52:01,131 --> 00:52:02,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Preach on, sister.

808
00:52:03,313 --> 00:52:03,553
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

809
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:05,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a face.

810
00:52:06,096 --> 00:52:06,576
[SPEAKER_04]: F that face.

811
00:52:06,716 --> 00:52:07,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done now.

812
00:52:07,497 --> 00:52:07,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

813
00:52:08,118 --> 00:52:09,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on to Loki.

814
00:52:14,278 --> 00:52:15,278
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this court's long enough.

815
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:15,959
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

816
00:52:16,179 --> 00:52:17,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

817
00:52:17,439 --> 00:52:20,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the first one, the first FU I have has a story behind it.

818
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:32,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I read on Yahoo News there's this guy, he's doing the movie industry for all the trailers that they have on before the movie and the commercials, because, you know, most of the time it's like, say, 12.45, 12.51, or in this case, it was like 5 minutes or something like that.

819
00:52:37,403 --> 00:52:38,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, F you to that guy because you suck.

820
00:52:38,943 --> 00:52:41,224
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't wait fucking five minutes to see the damn movie.

821
00:52:41,404 --> 00:52:42,725
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to wait fucking 15 minutes to see the movie.

822
00:52:42,745 --> 00:52:42,945
[SPEAKER_04]: No, wait.

823
00:52:43,025 --> 00:52:43,345
[SPEAKER_04]: No, wait.

824
00:52:43,405 --> 00:52:44,525
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I agree with that guy.

825
00:52:44,545 --> 00:52:46,086
[SPEAKER_04]: F those commercials.

826
00:52:46,126 --> 00:52:46,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, hey, hey.

827
00:52:46,806 --> 00:52:47,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

828
00:52:47,126 --> 00:52:47,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

829
00:52:47,566 --> 00:52:48,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Trailers are fine.

830
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:49,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

831
00:52:49,287 --> 00:52:50,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I haven't even gotten there yet.

832
00:52:50,587 --> 00:52:51,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, F you.

833
00:52:51,547 --> 00:52:52,267
[SPEAKER_10]: No, listen.

834
00:52:52,588 --> 00:52:52,988
[SPEAKER_10]: This is my...

835
00:52:54,329 --> 00:52:55,470
[SPEAKER_10]: This is my time, okay.

836
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:58,252
[SPEAKER_10]: So F you to that guy because you can't wait fucking five minutes.

837
00:52:58,272 --> 00:53:00,274
[SPEAKER_10]: And F you to the fucking viewers for putting commercials.

838
00:53:00,634 --> 00:53:01,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Then trailers.

839
00:53:02,076 --> 00:53:05,158
[SPEAKER_10]: In which case, then you've got, okay, this, okay.

840
00:53:05,198 --> 00:53:08,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Before Daredevil today, there was two fucking trailers for X-Men 2.

841
00:53:09,482 --> 00:53:10,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Right after each other.

842
00:53:10,903 --> 00:53:11,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

843
00:53:12,443 --> 00:53:14,444
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's different trailers, but it's not the point!

844
00:53:14,584 --> 00:53:17,286
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole point is there's two fucking trailers of the same goddamn movie!

845
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:20,468
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't forget that I just saw a trailer right before the last one!

846
00:53:21,148 --> 00:53:24,090
[SPEAKER_10]: God, and F you to the stupid movie industry for continuity issues!

847
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:24,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello!

848
00:53:24,851 --> 00:53:26,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Make your movies make sense!

849
00:53:26,592 --> 00:53:31,495
[SPEAKER_10]: When you see a reflection in someone's glasses the exact same way as looking at it, it doesn't make sense!

850
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:38,099
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have, like, a part in Daredevil, okay, where they've got this chick and, um, Elektra and Daredevil fighting...

851
00:53:38,419 --> 00:53:50,792
[SPEAKER_10]: for no apparent reason, he met her, hi, how you doing, I don't like being touched, so they get in this fight scene and stuff happens for no reason, which fight scene are you talking about, when he first met her in the park.

852
00:53:52,122 --> 00:54:04,713
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to Wells Fargo for not sending me a fucking replacement card when mine expired and I had to wait, first I had to wait in line for 30 minutes while some stupid person's like, I don't want to wait in line for 5 minutes

853
00:54:16,543 --> 00:54:23,050
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, he left and then he came back and made another scene saying how he wants to get his money and they said no and then he left.

854
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:27,494
[SPEAKER_10]: So I had to wait in line for that then to tell them, tell me to call 800 number to get my card.

855
00:54:27,954 --> 00:54:32,519
[SPEAKER_10]: What the fuck's the bank for if I, everything I need from, you know, the bank is through the 800 number?

856
00:54:32,739 --> 00:54:34,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Why the hell does a bank exist?

857
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:35,582
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why Jamie makes it safe.

858
00:54:36,969 --> 00:54:41,850
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that's just stupid, so I called the number and, yeah, they were nice, at least on the phone number.

859
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:46,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, F you to stupid old people, just because you're old and stupid.

860
00:54:46,791 --> 00:54:53,993
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, and F you to the Burger King, because no, I don't want to donate a fucking dollar to help children get wheelchairs.

861
00:54:54,293 --> 00:54:55,554
[SPEAKER_10]: They can rot in hell.

862
00:54:56,614 --> 00:54:59,214
[SPEAKER_10]: They were born defective, and they should die defective.

863
00:54:59,294 --> 00:55:01,235
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god, you're awful!

864
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,275
[SPEAKER_10]: So, enough of that.

865
00:55:05,376 --> 00:55:05,516
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

866
00:55:07,636 --> 00:55:18,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if this means in the future when everyone has test tube babies, you know, I'm sorry my child arrived with this part wrong, can I just have an order replacement part?

867
00:55:18,933 --> 00:55:20,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh sure, we'll order it from the cloning farm.

868
00:55:22,885 --> 00:55:24,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Children will come with warranties.

869
00:55:24,846 --> 00:55:25,687
[SPEAKER_10]: God damn.

870
00:55:27,128 --> 00:55:27,809
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what?

871
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:34,533
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care about all the stuff that's going on in the news, how they're talking about Saddam disarming, arming, doing whatever in Korea.

872
00:55:35,114 --> 00:55:37,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, seriously, does Korea want to get blown out of the sky?

873
00:55:37,615 --> 00:55:38,416
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, seriously.

874
00:55:38,436 --> 00:55:40,717
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just like, hey, we're building nukes now.

875
00:55:40,757 --> 00:55:41,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry, we don't care about you.

876
00:55:41,698 --> 00:55:42,619
[SPEAKER_10]: We're talking about Iraq.

877
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:44,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we just fired a missile.

878
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,701
[SPEAKER_10]: See, we can do that now.

879
00:55:46,101 --> 00:55:46,942
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't care about you.

880
00:55:46,962 --> 00:55:48,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we're amassing an army.

881
00:55:48,443 --> 00:55:48,603
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

882
00:55:48,643 --> 00:55:50,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want us to come over and nuke you?

883
00:55:50,485 --> 00:55:51,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that what you want?

884
00:55:51,505 --> 00:55:52,566
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you asking us to do it?

885
00:55:52,987 --> 00:55:55,248
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, because I'm sure we'd be just fine with doing that.

886
00:55:55,909 --> 00:55:58,591
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, seriously, it's like, hello, I'm here.

887
00:55:58,731 --> 00:55:59,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, I'm North Korea.

888
00:56:00,012 --> 00:56:00,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

889
00:56:01,113 --> 00:56:02,754
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's so stupid.

890
00:56:02,874 --> 00:56:04,596
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, you're not even a full country.

891
00:56:04,676 --> 00:56:06,377
[SPEAKER_10]: You're a north part of a continent.

892
00:56:07,258 --> 00:56:08,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Or part of a continent.

893
00:56:11,331 --> 00:56:13,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are like the toenails of the continent.

894
00:56:13,091 --> 00:56:18,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, North Korea, that's like North Dakota attacking us.

895
00:56:18,633 --> 00:56:19,413
[SPEAKER_10]: It's stupid.

896
00:56:21,133 --> 00:56:21,953
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it.

897
00:56:22,393 --> 00:56:26,954
[SPEAKER_04]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff.

898
00:56:27,234 --> 00:56:28,935
[SPEAKER_09]: And there is a missile silo in North Dakota.

899
00:56:29,195 --> 00:56:30,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki has funny angst.

900
00:56:31,475 --> 00:56:33,556
[SPEAKER_10]: God, I had other things.

901
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:34,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, oh yes.

902
00:56:34,856 --> 00:56:38,277
[SPEAKER_10]: An FB to my stupid Cypherbeat Nation pad.

903
00:56:38,357 --> 00:56:40,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Where are the fucking stupid pads I got?

904
00:56:40,817 --> 00:56:44,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Cypher Games, that's it, because they bend after one fucking game.

905
00:56:44,821 --> 00:56:48,524
[SPEAKER_10]: These nice pads, you know, fucking bent, like, instantly.

906
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:51,566
[SPEAKER_10]: They're supposed to, you know, support 300 pounds.

907
00:56:51,787 --> 00:56:57,572
[SPEAKER_10]: I think if someone stepped on those 300 pounds, the pads would just, like, just disintegrate and be gone.

908
00:56:58,673 --> 00:57:02,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, and one final FD to the movie industry.

909
00:57:03,477 --> 00:57:04,518
[SPEAKER_10]: I mentioned this before.

910
00:57:05,265 --> 00:57:11,534
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'm gonna say it again probably every week until this movie comes out and then after I see that movie just because I have to go make fun of it.

911
00:57:12,575 --> 00:57:18,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen, this whole continuity thing, the fucking movie The Core makes no fucking sense.

912
00:57:19,946 --> 00:57:21,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, okay, The Core.

913
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:25,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the core, basically, a brief summary.

914
00:57:26,113 --> 00:57:30,638
[SPEAKER_10]: We developed this weapon to cause earthquakes to, you know, attack people.

915
00:57:30,859 --> 00:57:38,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Then, oh, somehow we stopped the core from spinning, which causes weird electrical storms and shit that destroys the world, and we have to jumpstart the core.

916
00:57:38,287 --> 00:57:40,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how else do you think you jumpstart the core?

917
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:40,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well, it's...

918
00:57:41,090 --> 00:58:09,973
[SPEAKER_10]: designed this vehicle to drill into the middle of the core and everything's solved with nuclear weapons so why not detonate a nuclear bomb and hope that everything's fine and then ride the giant shockwave with the molten lava that's going to engulf the whole thing and magically fly out through the surface of the earth and be fine while this magic guy who's played by DJ Qualls or whatever his name is that stupid nerdy guy from Road Trip he's going to hack the planet because he's the best hacker ever he can hack the planet he's going to hack the information coming out of the planet

919
00:58:11,762 --> 00:58:12,383
[SPEAKER_10]: and so on.

920
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:37,803
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, stupid, out of, you know, fish out of water movies.

921
00:58:38,044 --> 00:58:38,524
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate them.

922
00:58:39,025 --> 00:58:40,447
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate them, and I wish you'd die.

923
00:58:41,548 --> 00:58:43,290
[SPEAKER_10]: We need more midget vampire movies.

924
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:45,052
[SPEAKER_10]: I have one, yeah.

925
00:58:45,552 --> 00:58:46,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Midget porn.

926
00:58:47,415 --> 00:58:48,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck midget porn.

927
00:58:50,238 --> 00:58:50,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

928
00:58:50,598 --> 00:58:51,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Vampire midget porn.

929
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,561
[SPEAKER_20]: Carpooling midgets!

930
00:58:54,633 --> 00:58:55,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you guys having a go?

931
00:58:55,995 --> 00:58:57,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you're up and ready to go?

932
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:58,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you want to do FUs really fast?

933
00:58:58,379 --> 00:58:59,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let you go first.

934
00:59:00,022 --> 00:59:00,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you want to do some FUs?

935
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:06,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Melby and Sharkscrawl are having to get going pretty soon here, so I thought I'd let them step in and do some FUs of the week if they would.

936
00:59:07,867 --> 00:59:09,609
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, well, I'll make this one real short and sweet.

937
00:59:09,669 --> 00:59:14,613
[SPEAKER_18]: Apparently, I'm just not as passionate as these other people, but I do have an IP of the week.

938
00:59:14,953 --> 00:59:18,596
[SPEAKER_18]: It's to those people who are, like, totally anti-against this upcoming Pony campaign.

939
00:59:18,616 --> 00:59:23,941
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if any of y'all heard of it, but I guess Pony wants to have Jenna Jameson, of all people, be their spokesmodel.

940
00:59:24,281 --> 00:59:28,425
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, and, like, they're going to put billboards and everything all around SoCal and all that stuff.

941
00:59:28,445 --> 00:59:29,546
[SPEAKER_18]: There's just, like, this total...

942
00:59:30,646 --> 00:59:31,907
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know why.

943
00:59:32,347 --> 00:59:35,910
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, can't porn stars just get normal credibility like everyone else?

944
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:37,090
[SPEAKER_18]: They want to be real actors.

945
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:38,211
[SPEAKER_18]: They got feelings too.

946
00:59:38,891 --> 00:59:39,732
[SPEAKER_18]: Hell, I would.

947
00:59:41,213 --> 00:59:42,253
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I could see it right now.

948
00:59:42,374 --> 00:59:43,654
[SPEAKER_18]: After that, find Ron Jeremy.

949
00:59:43,954 --> 00:59:44,935
[SPEAKER_18]: He could be up on TV.

950
00:59:45,035 --> 00:59:47,597
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, me and a pony have one thing in common.

951
00:59:48,277 --> 00:59:48,817
[SPEAKER_18]: Ha!

952
00:59:49,338 --> 00:59:50,198
[SPEAKER_18]: Whips him right out.

953
00:59:50,619 --> 00:59:52,740
[SPEAKER_18]: And then, of course, you know, it comes down right to the shoes.

954
00:59:53,974 --> 01:00:02,517
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, that's just, I, you know, personally, that's just, I just don't get mad at the world very much, just when people hate porn, you know.

955
01:00:04,337 --> 01:00:04,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Porn is cool.

956
01:00:05,117 --> 01:00:07,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Go see Dream Quest.

957
01:00:07,918 --> 01:00:08,298
[SPEAKER_11]: It's cool.

958
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:10,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Never mind.

959
01:00:10,279 --> 01:00:12,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, anyway.

960
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:14,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Sharks, do you have any FUs you'd like to give?

961
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:15,340
[SPEAKER_04]: She's shaking her head no.

962
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how about any final thoughts before you guys have to head out?

963
01:00:21,207 --> 01:00:21,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, babe.

964
01:00:22,348 --> 01:00:24,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, we'll see you next time.

965
01:00:24,729 --> 01:00:25,669
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to come back and visit us.

966
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:26,930
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you at March Madness, yes?

967
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:29,351
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, I don't know if I'll be here for March Madness.

968
01:00:29,472 --> 01:00:30,752
[SPEAKER_21]: I have Sharks tickets, I think.

969
01:00:31,292 --> 01:00:34,674
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's most likely I'm not bringing Sharks tickets this year.

970
01:00:34,694 --> 01:00:36,415
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's going to be the last game I get to see for a long time.

971
01:00:36,555 --> 01:00:40,217
[SPEAKER_21]: So I've blown off two different games to come see you guys.

972
01:00:40,778 --> 01:00:41,698
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, all right.

973
01:00:41,798 --> 01:00:42,859
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't do it this third time.

974
01:00:43,299 --> 01:00:43,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

975
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:43,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to check.

976
01:00:44,259 --> 01:00:45,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I cry, but okay.

977
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:46,561
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, good.

978
01:00:46,701 --> 01:00:47,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Mel, any final thoughts for Mel B?

979
01:00:49,915 --> 01:00:53,237
[SPEAKER_18]: Moose are so nearsighted, they often try to mate with cars.

980
01:00:54,938 --> 01:00:56,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, I did not know that.

981
01:00:56,339 --> 01:00:57,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know that, Jamie?

982
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:58,460
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, yes.

983
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,602
[SPEAKER_21]: God bless Cram.

984
01:01:00,922 --> 01:01:01,963
[SPEAKER_21]: Go watch Cram.

985
01:01:02,243 --> 01:01:03,203
[SPEAKER_21]: And we need to call the Cram.

986
01:01:03,223 --> 01:01:06,405
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to be on Cram, and we're going to cover it for Orange Lounge Radio.

987
01:01:06,446 --> 01:01:07,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait.

988
01:01:07,186 --> 01:01:09,648
[SPEAKER_21]: They're going to put us at a storefront and make us stay up for 24 hours.

989
01:01:09,688 --> 01:01:10,948
[SPEAKER_21]: That's going to be freaking entertaining.

990
01:01:11,028 --> 01:01:18,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I could never do that, because that would be like reliving all of middle school, high school, and college.

991
01:01:19,446 --> 01:01:21,469
[SPEAKER_02]: That accounts for ten years of my life.

992
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to relive that ever again.

993
01:01:28,417 --> 01:01:31,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Shark Skull's back there explaining the concept of Cram the Loki.

994
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:32,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Shall I just explain it to everybody?

995
01:01:32,662 --> 01:01:33,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please do.

996
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,444
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, it's a game show on the Game Show Network.

997
01:01:34,464 --> 01:01:37,968
[SPEAKER_21]: They showed it, like, depending on what feed you get, it's either 8 or 11 p.m.

998
01:01:38,008 --> 01:01:38,389
[SPEAKER_21]: weekdays.

999
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:40,375
[SPEAKER_21]: The concept is this.

1000
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:41,897
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a trivia show.

1001
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:47,524
[SPEAKER_21]: They give you all the books, all the information you need, and you have to stay up for 24 hours straight.

1002
01:01:47,544 --> 01:01:48,405
[SPEAKER_21]: You're not allowed to sleep.

1003
01:01:48,586 --> 01:01:49,587
[SPEAKER_21]: You're in a storefront.

1004
01:01:49,787 --> 01:01:50,588
[SPEAKER_21]: People can see in.

1005
01:01:50,608 --> 01:01:52,110
[SPEAKER_21]: You can see them.

1006
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:55,355
[SPEAKER_21]: I've seen people making faces and doing entertaining things to the people outside.

1007
01:01:56,067 --> 01:02:14,860
[SPEAKER_21]: and you have to read all these books and all this information and remember it and then they quiz you on it when you get on the show and make you do entertaining things like stand on like balance beams and stuff but mind you you haven't slept in over 24 hours so it's pretty fun to watch these people and then at the end if you actually make it and you're the winning team they have this lovely woman

1008
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:21,595
[SPEAKER_21]: who will tuck you into a nice warm bed and put a nice black eye cover on you and read you facts.

1009
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:25,018
[SPEAKER_21]: And she reads you facts in a voice like this.

1010
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:30,082
[SPEAKER_21]: Adolf Hitler and Mussolini both had venereal disease.

1011
01:02:30,802 --> 01:02:33,104
[SPEAKER_21]: You are getting so sleepy.

1012
01:02:33,465 --> 01:02:35,426
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm just like, oh shit, I'd be gone.

1013
01:02:37,027 --> 01:02:39,570
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you win, you have to answer five questions in a row, right?

1014
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:40,190
[SPEAKER_21]: And you get $10,000.

1015
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:42,412
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think we'd be fabulous.

1016
01:02:42,472 --> 01:02:43,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think Melody and I would take it all.

1017
01:02:43,873 --> 01:02:45,034
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got to get on there.

1018
01:02:46,713 --> 01:02:50,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I would do okay at this, except for the fact that I don't want to.

1019
01:02:51,857 --> 01:02:57,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when I was in college, every time an exam would come up, I wouldn't sleep for four days.

1020
01:02:58,601 --> 01:03:01,303
[SPEAKER_02]: The most I stayed awake was five days in a row.

1021
01:03:02,824 --> 01:03:04,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked during part of this.

1022
01:03:05,266 --> 01:03:10,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I stayed up one night running D&D, actually two nights running D&D games while people were studying.

1023
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:14,632
[SPEAKER_02]: And I took all of my exams, did not make less than a B on them.

1024
01:03:15,979 --> 01:03:20,542
[SPEAKER_02]: The last day, after all my exams, I'm sitting at my friend's house watching them on their computer.

1025
01:03:20,562 --> 01:03:22,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Next thing I know, I'm in my dorm room, in bed.

1026
01:03:25,285 --> 01:03:25,925
[SPEAKER_21]: Blink, blink.

1027
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:28,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like a bad sorority party.

1028
01:03:31,009 --> 01:03:31,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved college.

1029
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:36,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, you know, whenever there's an opportunity that comes up to make an ass out of myself, I'm there.

1030
01:03:36,952 --> 01:03:38,554
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, Melody, we gotta do it.

1031
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:40,995
[SPEAKER_21]: And hey, not only do you make an ass out of yourself, you get money for it.

1032
01:03:41,015 --> 01:03:41,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, money, money, money.

1033
01:03:44,017 --> 01:03:45,278
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like they'll be asking me questions...

1034
01:03:50,478 --> 01:03:51,378
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, bye, guys.

1035
01:03:51,398 --> 01:03:52,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for coming.

1036
01:03:52,699 --> 01:03:54,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, we're so happy you guys came.

1037
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:59,181
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll get back to the angst in just a minute here, but first some lovey-dovey hugs all around.

1038
01:03:59,561 --> 01:04:00,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Hug, hug, hug.

1039
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:01,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw.

1040
01:04:03,543 --> 01:04:04,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming.

1041
01:04:05,204 --> 01:04:05,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1042
01:04:05,564 --> 01:04:06,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a safe trip back.

1043
01:04:06,924 --> 01:04:07,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

1044
01:04:07,204 --> 01:04:07,684
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?

1045
01:04:08,265 --> 01:04:09,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Big hug for Mel B. All right.

1046
01:04:10,325 --> 01:04:10,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, manly hug.

1047
01:04:11,426 --> 01:04:11,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1048
01:04:12,906 --> 01:04:13,267
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1049
01:04:13,287 --> 01:04:14,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1050
01:04:14,967 --> 01:04:15,647
[SPEAKER_04]: He said bye.

1051
01:04:18,941 --> 01:04:20,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Mel B and Shark Skrull have left the building.

1052
01:04:21,842 --> 01:04:23,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so back to the fuck you's then.

1053
01:04:24,263 --> 01:04:24,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's your booze?

1054
01:04:25,263 --> 01:04:26,143
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get booze, you're driving.

1055
01:04:26,163 --> 01:04:26,623
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your turn.

1056
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:28,624
[SPEAKER_04]: You can drink the drop sitter at the bottom of here.

1057
01:04:30,904 --> 01:04:31,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1058
01:04:32,445 --> 01:04:33,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

1059
01:04:35,066 --> 01:04:36,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I have some FUs of the week.

1060
01:04:41,447 --> 01:04:44,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, my first FU of the week goes to...

1061
01:04:46,448 --> 01:04:54,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Irene, because Irene was rooting against me today in Mario Party 4, because she was just pissed off that I whooped her ass last night at Mario Party 4.

1062
01:04:55,732 --> 01:04:59,514
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, of course, I won the game again, just to show you not to fuck with me in Mario Party.

1063
01:05:00,595 --> 01:05:01,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I rule.

1064
01:05:02,176 --> 01:05:02,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1065
01:05:03,976 --> 01:05:10,700
[SPEAKER_04]: My other... My other FU of the week goes to Mardi Gras last night, because I'm not willing to do that for beats.

1066
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:12,901
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess that's really it.

1067
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:15,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's all my... Oh, you... What?

1068
01:05:16,414 --> 01:05:19,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Sadly enough, you guys almost convinced me to go with you.

1069
01:05:20,676 --> 01:05:21,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1070
01:05:21,577 --> 01:05:21,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Almost.

1071
01:05:22,257 --> 01:05:23,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Until the beats thing?

1072
01:05:23,818 --> 01:05:25,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, not the whole beats thing.

1073
01:05:25,319 --> 01:05:27,180
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just really bored last night.

1074
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,842
[SPEAKER_10]: I ended up falling asleep working on my website.

1075
01:05:30,122 --> 01:05:31,122
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't be the last time we go.

1076
01:05:31,142 --> 01:05:32,243
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go again.

1077
01:05:32,683 --> 01:05:33,624
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never been there.

1078
01:05:34,084 --> 01:05:34,784
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fun.

1079
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:39,187
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been hit on by gay guys before down at Sunday Night at the Rage.

1080
01:05:39,567 --> 01:05:44,450
[SPEAKER_04]: You would probably get hit on by less people at this club than you would there, honestly, because enough straight people go there.

1081
01:05:52,153 --> 01:06:06,529
[SPEAKER_02]: My other fuck you of the week that since Rob reminded me and one I brought up to Brad earlier today is that fuck you to everybody who uses the word Mardi Gras for an excuse to throw a party because first of all Mardi Gras means Fat Tuesday

1082
01:06:07,225 --> 01:06:09,866
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the day before Ash Wednesday, right?

1083
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:10,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1084
01:06:11,027 --> 01:06:16,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Mardi Gras is, the real ones are held in Mobile, which is where it started, where I'm from, Mobile, Alabama.

1085
01:06:17,569 --> 01:06:20,230
[SPEAKER_02]: New Orleans, which is, you know, basically crap Mardi Gras.

1086
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:24,052
[SPEAKER_04]: For fraternity and sorority girls to end up on Girls Gone Wild.

1087
01:06:24,432 --> 01:06:24,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1088
01:06:25,052 --> 01:06:27,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I forgot to ask Melody when Guys Gone Wild's coming out.

1089
01:06:27,994 --> 01:06:28,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it.

1090
01:06:29,114 --> 01:06:32,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and they hold it in Biloxi, Mississippi.

1091
01:06:32,615 --> 01:06:34,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have to ask, this is really, really important.

1092
01:06:34,596 --> 01:06:36,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, when does Guys Gone Wild come out?

1093
01:06:36,542 --> 01:06:37,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we want to know.

1094
01:06:38,263 --> 01:06:41,584
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, actually, Guys Gone Wild was supposedly already out.

1095
01:06:41,784 --> 01:06:46,086
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been trying to get the video, but I've had it on backorder for two months.

1096
01:06:47,827 --> 01:06:48,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Guys going crazy.

1097
01:06:48,847 --> 01:06:58,292
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had it on backorder for like two months now, and apparently the studio that we ordered it from is such a small studio that they won't take orders when we have so many titles on order.

1098
01:06:59,592 --> 01:07:07,180
[SPEAKER_10]: I had another one also, girls going XXX wild, extra wild or something like that.

1099
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:16,549
[SPEAKER_10]: But the guy's going crazy from what I heard, it's just a bunch of video of guys getting head and stuff from women and stuff, I think.

1100
01:07:17,561 --> 01:07:19,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see guys getting head from other guys.

1101
01:07:20,422 --> 01:07:21,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay?

1102
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:22,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie, don't hold back.

1103
01:07:22,823 --> 01:07:23,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know what?

1104
01:07:23,963 --> 01:07:24,404
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1105
01:07:24,444 --> 01:07:28,945
[SPEAKER_10]: We can get you some... I can try... I know that they have some of those Vivid DVDs.

1106
01:07:29,265 --> 01:07:31,686
[SPEAKER_10]: I had one at one point in my possession.

1107
01:07:31,746 --> 01:07:35,568
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I ended up throwing it out when I moved, but we had one.

1108
01:07:35,628 --> 01:07:36,248
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like...

1109
01:07:36,741 --> 01:07:39,323
[SPEAKER_10]: They had, like, a bunch of, you know, guy fucking scenes.

1110
01:07:39,343 --> 01:07:41,705
[SPEAKER_10]: They had one guy getting fucked by a machine type thing.

1111
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:42,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah!

1112
01:07:43,367 --> 01:07:43,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah!

1113
01:07:44,848 --> 01:07:46,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want a guy on a robot.

1114
01:07:46,089 --> 01:07:46,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn.

1115
01:07:46,509 --> 01:07:51,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to tell you about the site that I found by accident, Man Machine.

1116
01:07:51,874 --> 01:07:52,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Accident, huh?

1117
01:07:53,095 --> 01:07:54,256
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's real.

1118
01:07:54,616 --> 01:08:01,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I was, okay, I was looking at Bill Jensche, but I found this one that, it was a link to this, and I think this site is down, I thought it was manmachine.com.

1119
01:08:03,266 --> 01:08:10,656
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was these guys, like the first thing you see on this page is this guy attached to a machine with like this rotating thing of his ass.

1120
01:08:13,235 --> 01:08:17,839
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, I couldn't, it was... Is that like the fleshlight?

1121
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:19,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1122
01:08:20,261 --> 01:08:24,225
[SPEAKER_02]: But back to what I was saying, what was I saying?

1123
01:08:25,266 --> 01:08:25,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, Mardi Gras.

1124
01:08:25,966 --> 01:08:26,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, Mardi Gras.

1125
01:08:27,107 --> 01:08:31,411
[SPEAKER_02]: That thing that you went to last night, I can't think that that was Mardi Gras.

1126
01:08:31,471 --> 01:08:34,334
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it wasn't Mardi Gras, it was Show Your Dick, Get Some Beats Night.

1127
01:08:34,674 --> 01:08:35,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1128
01:08:36,115 --> 01:08:39,759
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I would only show any of my body parts

1129
01:08:40,942 --> 01:08:43,764
[SPEAKER_02]: If there was a lot of money involved and nobody else was there.

1130
01:08:45,505 --> 01:08:48,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn off all the lights, give me a million dollars, flash!

1131
01:08:49,067 --> 01:08:50,168
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, flash in the night.

1132
01:08:54,811 --> 01:08:58,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you brought the show back to Bomani because we kind of forgot our roots there for a minute.

1133
01:08:58,053 --> 01:09:00,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Flash in the night, in the dark where no one can see.

1134
01:09:00,054 --> 01:09:05,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, because we've got to finish the segment now because it's already been going for about 40 minutes.

1135
01:09:07,379 --> 01:09:09,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start with the intern, Ryan, what's up?

1136
01:09:10,905 --> 01:09:11,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I've only got a couple, really.

1137
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:14,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up!

1138
01:09:14,873 --> 01:09:16,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm saying an FU.

1139
01:09:17,297 --> 01:09:17,678
[SPEAKER_06]: FU.

1140
01:09:18,259 --> 01:09:18,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1141
01:09:19,542 --> 01:09:20,503
[SPEAKER_06]: No, like, one I got is...

1142
01:09:22,544 --> 01:09:28,290
[SPEAKER_06]: FU to all the little kids and the one adult who decided it would be a good idea to run across the crosswalk on DDR.

1143
01:09:28,591 --> 01:09:39,282
[SPEAKER_06]: And for people who don't know what the crosswalk is, we gave it the name basically because there's the machine and a lot of places have that wood piece between the panels and the machine.

1144
01:09:41,324 --> 01:09:44,445
[SPEAKER_06]: So kids decided to run across there over and over and over again.

1145
01:09:44,886 --> 01:09:45,766
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had an adult.

1146
01:09:45,806 --> 01:09:54,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Last night I was playing over at Scandia and some little kid got up on there when I was doing doubles and I knocked the kid like four feet off the panel.

1147
01:09:54,249 --> 01:09:55,990
[SPEAKER_06]: His dad just laughed at him though.

1148
01:09:57,389 --> 01:09:58,710
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's cool.

1149
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:00,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I said, I feel really bad.

1150
01:10:00,651 --> 01:10:02,352
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's all, no, don't worry about it.

1151
01:10:02,412 --> 01:10:03,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I told him not to go up there.

1152
01:10:04,653 --> 01:10:06,294
[SPEAKER_04]: That guy gets the parenting award of the week.

1153
01:10:06,534 --> 01:10:06,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1154
01:10:07,575 --> 01:10:08,355
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really cool.

1155
01:10:08,455 --> 01:10:14,259
[SPEAKER_06]: And another one is, fuck you to people who think it is the coolest idea to stand behind you.

1156
01:10:14,279 --> 01:10:16,160
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like, what the hell?

1157
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:17,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1158
01:10:20,662 --> 01:10:21,843
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not Miss America.

1159
01:10:21,943 --> 01:10:23,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop balancing things on your head.

1160
01:10:23,124 --> 01:10:23,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I got one.

1161
01:10:23,784 --> 01:10:24,424
[SPEAKER_06]: It goes a little...

1162
01:10:27,415 --> 01:10:29,396
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of goes along with your movie thing.

1163
01:10:29,857 --> 01:10:35,661
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a story in this movie that I just saw a few years ago about a guy who kills people with rats.

1164
01:10:37,805 --> 01:10:39,506
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the weirdest idea ever.

1165
01:10:40,928 --> 01:10:44,010
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems just off the wall in a way that sucks.

1166
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:44,791
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I'm gonna say.

1167
01:10:44,811 --> 01:10:45,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have anything to add.

1168
01:10:46,452 --> 01:10:48,374
[SPEAKER_10]: One more F you and this goes to Scandia.

1169
01:10:48,474 --> 01:10:49,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually this goes to the kids of Scandia.

1170
01:10:50,856 --> 01:10:51,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1171
01:10:52,177 --> 01:10:59,062
[SPEAKER_10]: If I have to listen to you go WHOO WHOO every time a fucking whistle song comes out, I'm gonna kill you!

1172
01:10:59,963 --> 01:11:02,345
[SPEAKER_10]: They did that for like four fucking hours!

1173
01:11:04,005 --> 01:11:09,887
[SPEAKER_02]: We were in the top secret meeting room and we heard whoop whoop and Keith was like, oh yeah, they're playing the list of songs.

1174
01:11:10,487 --> 01:11:12,568
[SPEAKER_10]: They did that every game, like twice.

1175
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:20,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, I wanted to go have my lunch break and these people, I came in like three hours later to take my 20 minute break, these people were still in there doing this shit.

1176
01:11:21,171 --> 01:11:22,812
[SPEAKER_05]: It was driving me crazy.

1177
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:26,253
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember it was cool when you thought about it and didn't do it.

1178
01:11:26,273 --> 01:11:26,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1179
01:11:26,413 --> 01:11:27,693
[SPEAKER_06]: That was about it.

1180
01:11:27,993 --> 01:11:28,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1181
01:11:29,194 --> 01:11:29,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Like,

1182
01:11:30,925 --> 01:11:33,286
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they've been doing, yeah.

1183
01:12:00,601 --> 01:12:04,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't make fun of that, because some people used to do that.

1184
01:12:04,049 --> 01:12:05,312
[SPEAKER_06]: It really wasn't me or anything.

1185
01:12:05,332 --> 01:12:05,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Here.

1186
01:12:12,839 --> 01:12:14,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a couple fuck yous to make.

1187
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, because I had one more I needed to do, and then we can go to yours.

1188
01:12:17,961 --> 01:12:19,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here's my FU.

1189
01:12:20,242 --> 01:12:21,102
[SPEAKER_04]: My other FU of the week.

1190
01:12:21,122 --> 01:12:21,782
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a good one.

1191
01:12:22,282 --> 01:12:27,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, a bunch of us were standing all around just outside of the party room, kind of by the 2DX machine.

1192
01:12:27,184 --> 01:12:30,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Myself, Jamie, Irene, Brad, and Keith, Scandia Tech.

1193
01:12:31,166 --> 01:12:34,787
[SPEAKER_04]: We were all sitting around outside the party room.

1194
01:12:34,807 --> 01:12:37,728
[SPEAKER_04]: We were just kind of all standing there, and we're talking, da-da-da-da-da.

1195
01:12:37,988 --> 01:12:40,769
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're having a good time, and then all of a sudden I hear this voice behind me.

1196
01:12:41,329 --> 01:12:42,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me!

1197
01:12:43,611 --> 01:12:46,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this lady just all of a sudden out of nowhere, she's like, excuse me!

1198
01:12:47,033 --> 01:12:49,854
[SPEAKER_04]: And we all turn around and she's just, she's trying to get by.

1199
01:12:49,934 --> 01:12:53,897
[SPEAKER_04]: She didn't try to like tap anyone on the shoulder, just kind of like, even kind of like go and try to get by.

1200
01:12:54,157 --> 01:12:55,958
[SPEAKER_04]: She just went, excuse me!

1201
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:03,443
[SPEAKER_04]: And so she walked away and when she was, when she was kind of like out of sight but still within hearing distance, I went, you're excused!

1202
01:13:04,784 --> 01:13:06,525
[SPEAKER_04]: And she turned around and gave me the dirtiest look in the world.

1203
01:13:06,645 --> 01:13:06,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1204
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Irene said the best thing, though.

1205
01:13:10,522 --> 01:13:11,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you on your period?

1206
01:13:12,984 --> 01:13:15,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, no, it must be the day before.

1207
01:13:21,474 --> 01:13:22,475
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Johnny, yes.

1208
01:13:22,736 --> 01:13:22,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1209
01:13:23,497 --> 01:13:29,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnny Bombay has a couple of fuck you's to make that are really, like, legit.

1210
01:13:29,083 --> 01:13:31,827
[SPEAKER_05]: These are legit fuck you's, not something that I saw irritating me.

1211
01:13:31,847 --> 01:13:33,188
[SPEAKER_05]: These are, like, legit fuck you's.

1212
01:13:33,849 --> 01:13:38,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a fuck you, okay, a couple at Scania.

1213
01:13:38,595 --> 01:13:40,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so much at Scania, but...

1214
01:13:41,538 --> 01:13:44,660
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a few employees there that I need to say fuck you to.

1215
01:13:45,041 --> 01:13:47,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in LA a couple days ago and I bought a watch there.

1216
01:13:48,343 --> 01:13:51,645
[SPEAKER_05]: And I took it to my job.

1217
01:13:52,126 --> 01:13:53,306
[SPEAKER_05]: I had it in my backpack.

1218
01:13:53,807 --> 01:13:55,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I put my backpack down in our break room.

1219
01:13:56,235 --> 01:14:02,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I go in there, when I get off, I clocked out, I was ready to leave, I go in there to get it, and my watch is gone.

1220
01:14:03,219 --> 01:14:06,441
[SPEAKER_05]: The only people allowed in the break room are employees.

1221
01:14:07,221 --> 01:14:11,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, one of my fucking co-workers took my fucking watch, and I will kill you.

1222
01:14:11,963 --> 01:14:15,345
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's my fucking manager, I don't give a fuck, I will kill you.

1223
01:14:15,926 --> 01:14:17,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care if it's Paul.

1224
01:14:18,047 --> 01:14:18,347
[SPEAKER_05]: No way.

1225
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:21,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, no, wait, wait.

1226
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:22,211
[SPEAKER_08]: No, wait, Paul, yeah.

1227
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:25,513
[SPEAKER_07]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange On Radio.

1228
01:14:25,653 --> 01:14:27,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, Paul, never mind.

1229
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul, you can keep it.

1230
01:14:28,335 --> 01:14:29,136
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a present.

1231
01:14:29,676 --> 01:14:30,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1232
01:14:31,017 --> 01:14:35,461
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, okay, also, fuck you to some more fuck yous.

1233
01:14:35,481 --> 01:14:46,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, there are a lot of little kids there that are really immature, like, with the go-karts and everything, and it's like, nobody knows how to drive a go- it's like, it's so weird how people do not know how to drive a go-kart.

1234
01:14:47,129 --> 01:14:49,331
[SPEAKER_05]: All you have to do is gas and brake, gas and brake.

1235
01:14:50,109 --> 01:14:56,713
[SPEAKER_05]: We had some, we had, we had, fuck you to some senior citizens that came and rode go-karts at my job.

1236
01:14:57,173 --> 01:14:59,495
[SPEAKER_05]: They were the slowest go-kart riders in the world.

1237
01:15:01,976 --> 01:15:02,697
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so funny.

1238
01:15:03,277 --> 01:15:08,200
[SPEAKER_05]: You should have said, I know, you think they might have sped up, but no, it was all slow.

1239
01:15:10,642 --> 01:15:11,442
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much it.

1240
01:15:12,743 --> 01:15:15,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Dave, give us some FUs, really fast, this chatroom's getting restless.

1241
01:15:16,365 --> 01:15:22,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, um, well, I don't really have that many, just FU'd all the things that make me have to drive slower.

1242
01:15:22,868 --> 01:15:34,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Like speed limits, old people, the fear of cops, fast turns, shitty tires, and stoplights, all that stuff.

1243
01:15:34,413 --> 01:15:34,993
[SPEAKER_09]: They're bad.

1244
01:15:36,914 --> 01:15:39,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I try, yeah, okay, that's a lot of people.

1245
01:15:42,529 --> 01:15:44,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I'm not one of them, I'm not one of them, okay.

1246
01:15:45,191 --> 01:15:55,259
[SPEAKER_09]: No, um, and fuck you to not being able to turn fast enough, because, like, I was trying to go 50 in a residential area, and the tires started squealing hella bad.

1247
01:15:58,321 --> 01:15:58,841
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't go 60.

1248
01:16:02,484 --> 01:16:11,071
[SPEAKER_09]: No, and so, um, that's basically it, and F you to not being able to see into Jamie's car, because the light didn't seem to be working or something.

1249
01:16:12,288 --> 01:16:18,394
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I had to search around in the dark for like two minutes to try to find what I was looking for and then how to lock the car because I couldn't figure it out.

1250
01:16:18,835 --> 01:16:19,355
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's it.

1251
01:16:19,455 --> 01:16:19,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Rob.

1252
01:16:19,956 --> 01:16:21,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, chatroom FUs.

1253
01:16:21,417 --> 01:16:22,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna run through these.

1254
01:16:25,121 --> 01:16:25,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Bruheimer.

1255
01:16:26,402 --> 01:16:28,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck the snow for never fucking ending.

1256
01:16:28,204 --> 01:16:35,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck my swim team for having a boring ass social which I unfortunately attended only one to find that there were four people above the age of 15 there, me being one.

1257
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:36,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck potheads.

1258
01:16:38,553 --> 01:16:44,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Skyline says, I'm sorry, SkylineDC505 says, F you to initial D for making me broke, again.

1259
01:16:49,122 --> 01:16:51,163
[SPEAKER_04]: 23rd Magus says, Hey, that was four.

1260
01:17:10,269 --> 01:17:11,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one more fuck you.

1261
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:17,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you to myself for making one of the hardest DWIs ever because I'm an asshole.

1262
01:17:18,014 --> 01:17:22,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I made a DWI to hot limit that is really impossible.

1263
01:17:23,057 --> 01:17:23,917
[SPEAKER_05]: So fuck you to myself.

1264
01:17:25,797 --> 01:17:26,578
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes no sense.

1265
01:17:26,858 --> 01:17:27,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, moving on.

1266
01:17:27,438 --> 01:17:29,199
[SPEAKER_10]: And stop making bad remixes.

1267
01:17:29,539 --> 01:17:30,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Please.

1268
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:35,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because you know how to chop samples and put them next to each other doesn't mean you know how to remix.

1269
01:17:35,563 --> 01:17:38,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you to this song because I just started doing the Samba de Amiga stuff to it.

1270
01:17:39,445 --> 01:17:41,606
[SPEAKER_09]: The song rules and you still need to give me my porn.

1271
01:17:41,987 --> 01:17:42,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1272
01:17:42,347 --> 01:17:43,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a long time ago.

1273
01:17:44,648 --> 01:17:48,411
[SPEAKER_04]: The chatroom, okay, chatroom actually said, shut up, it's our turn.

1274
01:17:48,432 --> 01:17:52,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, my, dude, no, no, uh, Garrett?

1275
01:17:52,915 --> 01:17:57,239
[SPEAKER_09]: No, SkylineDC505 needs... No, he didn't say that, he just, somebody else did, but it's funny.

1276
01:17:57,259 --> 01:18:00,742
[SPEAKER_09]: No, look up farther, look up farther, it says it, uh, he needs... Moving on, moving on.

1277
01:18:00,902 --> 01:18:01,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

1278
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:02,123
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya.

1279
01:18:03,705 --> 01:18:07,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, DarkTetsuya says, fuck the fact that girls don't want to talk to him.

1280
01:18:08,249 --> 01:18:09,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Aww, girls want to talk to you.

1281
01:18:11,051 --> 01:18:11,532
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya.

1282
01:18:14,253 --> 01:18:14,933
[SPEAKER_04]: You bitch!

1283
01:18:15,033 --> 01:18:15,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1284
01:18:16,414 --> 01:18:17,514
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I'm teasing.

1285
01:18:18,254 --> 01:18:20,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I like our DT.

1286
01:18:20,935 --> 01:18:23,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck the initial D machine at CCL for being broken again.

1287
01:18:24,576 --> 01:18:24,916
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1288
01:18:28,397 --> 01:18:29,557
[SPEAKER_04]: You are so mean.

1289
01:18:29,677 --> 01:18:29,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1290
01:18:30,778 --> 01:18:31,598
[SPEAKER_02]: You know if I'm joking.

1291
01:18:31,798 --> 01:18:34,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Sautome Ranma says, hey, I have... You pronounced it right.

1292
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:35,419
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1293
01:18:35,539 --> 01:18:36,379
[SPEAKER_02]: You pronounced it right.

1294
01:18:36,679 --> 01:18:37,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy shit.

1295
01:18:37,099 --> 01:18:38,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob pronounced something right in Japanese.

1296
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:39,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

1297
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,881
[SPEAKER_04]: My eyes are slanting as we speak.

1298
01:18:42,061 --> 01:18:42,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1299
01:18:46,843 --> 01:18:48,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki in the back is going, Rob, you're getting shorter.

1300
01:18:48,684 --> 01:18:56,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I only have one F you, and it's to everyone that lies about their DDR accomplishments.

1301
01:18:56,287 --> 01:18:57,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Pisses me off.

1302
01:18:57,628 --> 01:19:00,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone who lies about their DDR accomplishments.

1303
01:19:01,029 --> 01:19:02,510
[SPEAKER_04]: You mean like Triple A and We Will Rock You?

1304
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:05,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1305
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:10,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Feh, sorry about the whole whore typing thing, I'm sleepless.

1306
01:19:10,803 --> 01:19:12,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I have a second, fuck you.

1307
01:19:12,563 --> 01:19:18,966
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all these secret spy camera pop-ups that have nearly, but not nearly naked women.

1308
01:19:19,826 --> 01:19:23,228
[SPEAKER_04]: As in, they're not clothed, nor naked, but painfully in the middle.

1309
01:19:23,588 --> 01:19:24,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck that!

1310
01:19:24,608 --> 01:19:25,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to J-List.

1311
01:19:25,588 --> 01:19:33,011
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to see boobs, if you want to see boobs and twat that's on the site that's not even a porn site, just go to J-List.com and look at the DVD section.

1312
01:19:33,051 --> 01:19:35,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go to... Persian Kitty, for Christ's sake.

1313
01:19:35,112 --> 01:19:36,832
[SPEAKER_10]: What's great is all those hidden camera sites.

1314
01:19:36,912 --> 01:19:39,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, the hidden camera things are for, like, security only.

1315
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:44,075
[SPEAKER_10]: So I never knew that I had naked models or close to naked models on my lawn.

1316
01:19:44,715 --> 01:19:46,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, hours of the day that I don't realize.

1317
01:19:46,476 --> 01:19:48,197
[SPEAKER_10]: But if I had a hidden camera, I would.

1318
01:19:48,797 --> 01:19:49,097
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm done.

1319
01:19:49,537 --> 01:19:52,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually do have one more fuck you, and that is to J-List.com.

1320
01:19:52,708 --> 01:19:56,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for a copy of Battle Royal on JList.com.

1321
01:19:57,312 --> 01:20:00,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, I have to look through so many pictures of boobs and twat, okay?

1322
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:04,319
[SPEAKER_02]: If I want to see boobs and twat, I'll actually go looking for porn, for real porn.

1323
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:19,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninja Usagi Koi I want to send an FU to whoever broke the fan in our arcade.

1324
01:20:19,698 --> 01:20:24,564
[SPEAKER_04]: A big FU to our arcade manager for raising the price and not fixing the machine so it breaks for two weeks.

1325
01:20:25,044 --> 01:20:29,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Then when it does get fixed, have to dish out $2 and die after the first round from the sheer heat.

1326
01:20:29,753 --> 01:20:32,157
[SPEAKER_02]: That is way too freaking much for DDR.

1327
01:20:32,197 --> 01:20:34,120
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll just be playing at the Metreon or something.

1328
01:20:34,781 --> 01:20:37,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, at either the Metreon or at a convention or something.

1329
01:20:39,565 --> 01:20:47,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, uh... SnubDistinoid says, Fuck anyone that sees the magical invisible crosswalk of space between the DDR pads and the machine.

1330
01:20:47,931 --> 01:20:48,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I failed an Oni.

1331
01:20:49,171 --> 01:20:55,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Matchhead got fucked up and Zero actually accidentally ran into a kid just because people have a fascination with fucking us up.

1332
01:20:55,716 --> 01:20:58,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care if I look stupid or if I suck, I just don't want to step on a kid.

1333
01:20:58,938 --> 01:20:59,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do I?

1334
01:20:59,578 --> 01:21:04,502
[SPEAKER_06]: That, like, really sucked, too, because he was doing really good on the Oni, then some stupid little girl walked in front of the screen.

1335
01:21:04,522 --> 01:21:07,804
[SPEAKER_06]: She didn't run, she took her sweet time and, like, stood there.

1336
01:21:08,244 --> 01:21:09,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a friggin' moron.

1337
01:21:11,511 --> 01:21:17,788
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna have to take to the tactics that we used to have at RVGL, where people would stand on either side of the machine.

1338
01:21:19,033 --> 01:21:21,415
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually what we started doing in the last half.

1339
01:21:21,515 --> 01:21:26,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Matchhead was there, and he was there, and I was there, and we were just standing on both sides of the machine.

1340
01:21:26,558 --> 01:21:33,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should get, like, caution tape or something, and put it right there, and have the only way you can get in between the bars, because that would save a lot of trouble.

1341
01:21:34,403 --> 01:21:42,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I will give another Scandia shirt to somebody, and we could just, I'll just give it to everybody, and we could just stand on each side, or they're wearing a Scandia shirt.

1342
01:21:42,529 --> 01:21:44,270
[SPEAKER_04]: With the arms folded, looking intimidating.

1343
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:44,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

1344
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:45,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, moving on with this FU.

1345
01:21:45,991 --> 01:21:47,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Did Ned expect us to fix the machine?

1346
01:21:48,012 --> 01:21:48,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember how.

1347
01:21:49,173 --> 01:21:52,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and fuck you to the kids who would not stop playing the whistle song.

1348
01:21:52,914 --> 01:21:54,935
[SPEAKER_04]: That song is horrible.

1349
01:21:55,435 --> 01:21:59,396
[SPEAKER_04]: And the guttural noises that they were screaming out made me ashamed of being an Aerosmasher.

1350
01:21:59,496 --> 01:22:00,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck them right in the ear.

1351
01:22:00,917 --> 01:22:02,557
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all, surprisingly less than last week.

1352
01:22:02,597 --> 01:22:02,857
[SPEAKER_04]: P.S.

1353
01:22:02,877 --> 01:22:05,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Scandia was fun yesterday, but there were entirely too many people there.

1354
01:22:06,738 --> 01:22:10,099
[SPEAKER_04]: RYC3 Rice says, fuck you to the bad weather in SoCal.

1355
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:15,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you local LA arcade owners for not believing you can't unlock songs on Extreme just by playing.

1356
01:22:15,361 --> 01:22:15,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi guys!

1357
01:22:17,659 --> 01:22:17,999
Hi!

1358
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:26,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Daft Square says, F you damn Cali bastards who get all the awesome Bomani stuff while we Easterners take it in the butt as far as Bomani goes.

1359
01:22:26,766 --> 01:22:28,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm jealous of you lucky sons of bitches.

1360
01:22:29,108 --> 01:22:30,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Then move out here like I did.

1361
01:22:30,689 --> 01:22:34,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I gave up my life and got on a plane.

1362
01:22:34,172 --> 01:22:35,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it was before there was Bomani out here.

1363
01:22:36,053 --> 01:22:38,655
[SPEAKER_04]: But the East Coast has hurricanes and snow.

1364
01:22:41,557 --> 01:22:43,459
[SPEAKER_10]: And planes are going to skyscrapers.

1365
01:22:44,099 --> 01:22:44,760
[SPEAKER_10]: And terrorists...

1366
01:22:46,454 --> 01:22:47,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Lower gas prices, though.

1367
01:22:51,376 --> 01:22:53,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Snow, lots of snow.

1368
01:22:54,317 --> 01:22:57,799
[SPEAKER_04]: At least we don't have to pay like 20 bucks just to get to the arcade.

1369
01:22:59,439 --> 01:23:01,820
[SPEAKER_02]: But also keep in mind that food is taxed there.

1370
01:23:05,081 --> 01:23:06,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

1371
01:23:11,377 --> 01:23:12,338
[SPEAKER_04]: The guys are off.

1372
01:23:12,379 --> 01:23:13,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you are off the hook tonight.

1373
01:23:14,121 --> 01:23:17,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Black Lab says, Fuck the horrible dining hall food.

1374
01:23:18,046 --> 01:23:19,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck the boring city of Davis.

1375
01:23:19,688 --> 01:23:20,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Davis?

1376
01:23:20,289 --> 01:23:20,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Davis?

1377
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:22,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost said Danish.

1378
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:23,613
[SPEAKER_02]: The People's Republic of Davis.

1379
01:23:24,814 --> 01:23:28,077
[SPEAKER_04]: and fuck cheaters in online games and fuck boredom.

1380
01:23:28,317 --> 01:23:29,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was the purpose of online games.

1381
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:34,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but he's also part of staff, so he's allowed.

1382
01:23:34,642 --> 01:23:40,166
[SPEAKER_04]: JB, Justin Circuit, says F you to airplanes, not being the speed of light so I can get my customized CD quicker.

1383
01:23:40,886 --> 01:23:43,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck Sky for playing the not-full version of Irresistible Men.

1384
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:47,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you too, I'll do what I want, bitch.

1385
01:23:48,027 --> 01:23:50,548
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to my mom for making me clean my room that's still messy.

1386
01:23:51,509 --> 01:23:53,150
[SPEAKER_04]: FU for making me FU's only three.

1387
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:55,991
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he says play a song.

1388
01:23:57,732 --> 01:24:00,513
[SPEAKER_04]: The song I'm sending now is an excellent cover of I'm Like a Bird.

1389
01:24:01,634 --> 01:24:02,495
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, we might have to try that.

1390
01:24:02,515 --> 01:24:03,575
[SPEAKER_22]: We've dedicated this to Rob.

1391
01:24:03,855 --> 01:24:04,736
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Rob's diva day.

1392
01:24:04,776 --> 01:24:05,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll try that.

1393
01:24:05,516 --> 01:24:05,916
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll try that.

1394
01:24:05,936 --> 01:24:06,777
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll play that next break.

1395
01:24:07,257 --> 01:24:16,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, VidPowah says, FU to dumb workers who can't properly put up a restaurant sign and have only three-fourths of the letters light up while practically the rest of the entire mall has perfectly lit up signs.

1396
01:24:22,717 --> 01:24:34,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Jay Kinetic, our favorite Jay Kinetic says Fuck you to Stone Cold Steve Often for coming back to the WWE I can't watch Raw Or is it Smackdown, the more suited show for Stone Cold

1397
01:24:34,608 --> 01:24:37,030
[SPEAKER_10]: He got tired of beating his wife, so now he has to beat on wrestlers.

1398
01:24:37,070 --> 01:24:37,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1399
01:24:37,751 --> 01:24:40,493
[SPEAKER_04]: For coming back, slapping your wife in anger is never okay.

1400
01:24:40,973 --> 01:24:45,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you to every scrub at Southland Mall tonight who couldn't play any song besides Orion 7-8.

1401
01:24:46,017 --> 01:24:47,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Dang, that's like a year ago.

1402
01:24:47,999 --> 01:24:49,920
[SPEAKER_04]: With Orion 7-8 getting played all the time.

1403
01:24:50,781 --> 01:24:52,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you to the guy who made pop-up porn.

1404
01:24:52,923 --> 01:24:56,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't give a shit about your sister getting ass raped violently by a horse while you shit on her face.

1405
01:24:57,507 --> 01:24:59,368
[SPEAKER_04]: If I wanted prawn, I'd go to PersianKitty.com.

1406
01:25:00,649 --> 01:25:01,529
[SPEAKER_04]: as I recommended earlier.

1407
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:06,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Jay Kinetic also says, Fuck you to bitch-ass roommates who don't do their dishes.

1408
01:25:06,130 --> 01:25:09,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I work 40 hours a week and I still have a way to work out, wash dishes, and bullshit on the internet.

1409
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:15,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you to world discounters for some of the most ghetto, fake, crass, and bullshit stuff for high prices.

1410
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:21,874
[SPEAKER_10]: And F you to HappyHackers.com for taking down their backdoor section so now I can't get free porn from them.

1411
01:25:25,709 --> 01:25:28,590
[SPEAKER_04]: And on that note, I think we finally exhausted the FUs of the week.

1412
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:29,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a request.

1413
01:25:29,551 --> 01:25:30,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Jesus.

1414
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:31,952
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no request for a song.

1415
01:25:32,292 --> 01:25:32,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what?

1416
01:25:32,632 --> 01:25:34,873
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is important.

1417
01:25:35,093 --> 01:25:41,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Later this week, we have lost one of our most beloved childhood entertainers.

1418
01:25:42,297 --> 01:25:45,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Rogers died this week.

1419
01:25:45,058 --> 01:25:48,059
[SPEAKER_10]: That was very sad.

1420
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:49,420
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have the Mr. Rogers theme.

1421
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,700
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we should play it during the break.

1422
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:51,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1423
01:25:53,883 --> 01:25:57,846
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood, a beautiful day in the neighborhood.

1424
01:26:34,828 --> 01:26:36,550
[SPEAKER_02]: You were already fucking it up.

1425
01:26:36,770 --> 01:26:38,612
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beautiful day for a neighborhood.

1426
01:26:38,632 --> 01:26:39,893
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beautiful day for a neighborhood.

1427
01:26:39,913 --> 01:26:40,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you be mine?

1428
01:26:41,055 --> 01:26:42,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not a beautiful day for a neighborhood.

1429
01:26:42,836 --> 01:26:43,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Then could you be mine?

1430
01:26:45,246 --> 01:26:47,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, chat room, send it to us.

1431
01:26:48,288 --> 01:26:53,272
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I have perfect pitch, and hearing this many people off-key is giving me a headache again.

1432
01:26:53,432 --> 01:26:56,814
[SPEAKER_02]: If no one brings it, then I'll just bring it next time.

1433
01:26:56,854 --> 01:26:59,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, all of you are now Politary, so shut up.

1434
01:26:59,996 --> 01:27:02,378
[SPEAKER_02]: For I'd beat you like Politary.

1435
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:06,940
[SPEAKER_04]: One last comment.

1436
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,261
[SPEAKER_04]: One last comment before we go to break.

1437
01:27:10,021 --> 01:27:13,802
[SPEAKER_04]: And as the chat room is saying, we're disgracing the memory of a living saint.

1438
01:27:13,822 --> 01:27:16,562
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like manny faces, remember, from He-Man?

1439
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:17,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1440
01:27:18,502 --> 01:27:20,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Satomi Ranma says, Hey, look, it's me.

1441
01:27:20,823 --> 01:27:24,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to comment that Battle Royale is the most traumatizing movie I've ever seen.

1442
01:27:25,224 --> 01:27:26,464
[SPEAKER_04]: I recommend it wholeheartedly.

1443
01:27:26,524 --> 01:27:27,184
[SPEAKER_04]: It made me cry.

1444
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:30,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how they based a movie on kids killing each other, but they did it.

1445
01:27:30,765 --> 01:27:31,825
[SPEAKER_04]: But you should buy it anyways.

1446
01:27:32,325 --> 01:27:42,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Battle Royal is actually, and I found out more about this, is basically was sent as a statement to Japanese children, because actually school violence has gotten to be at a pretty big high.

1447
01:27:43,756 --> 01:27:46,859
[SPEAKER_02]: And Japan said they made this to show the extreme side of violence in school.

1448
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:55,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, just like Series 7 said F you to the reality shows, and after Series 7 came out, so did tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons of reality shows.

1449
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:56,910
[SPEAKER_10]: So that didn't work.

1450
01:27:57,030 --> 01:27:58,311
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're making a second Battle Royale.

1451
01:27:59,692 --> 01:28:00,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Number two, coming out soon.

1452
01:28:01,193 --> 01:28:02,595
[SPEAKER_10]: I have the first one, and it was awesome.

1453
01:28:02,915 --> 01:28:07,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially the guy that goes around and kills everybody, because he's awesome, and then he gets killed in the end.

1454
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:08,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's awesome.

1455
01:28:11,002 --> 01:28:16,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Jay Kinetic says, we fucked up the Mr. Rogers song so bad, it's as bad as George Bush not knowing the words to Jingle Bells.

1456
01:28:18,428 --> 01:28:20,710
[SPEAKER_22]: Strong Mad forgets the lyrics to his favorite songs.

1457
01:28:21,030 --> 01:28:22,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, okay, we're going to go to a break.

1458
01:28:22,851 --> 01:28:25,973
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to play that song JB says should be dedicated.

1459
01:28:26,493 --> 01:28:29,355
[SPEAKER_04]: JB says we should play and Jamie says should be dedicated to me.

1460
01:28:29,395 --> 01:28:31,516
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Sheldon with I'm Like a Bird, the dance remix.

1461
01:28:34,098 --> 01:28:36,079
[SPEAKER_02]: That loud popping noise was brought to you by Propel.

1462
01:28:36,399 --> 01:28:36,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Ow.

1463
01:28:37,259 --> 01:28:37,980
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll be back.

1464
01:33:10,515 --> 01:33:10,835
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1465
01:33:10,935 --> 01:33:11,496
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, everybody.

1466
01:33:11,696 --> 01:33:11,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1467
01:33:12,416 --> 01:33:15,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, thanks to Akuma GM, we have the real thing.

1468
01:33:15,879 --> 01:33:21,443
[SPEAKER_04]: So since you guys fucked it up so bad, myself included, sorry, here's your chance to study.

1469
01:33:21,763 --> 01:33:23,004
[SPEAKER_04]: So there will be a quiz later.

1470
01:33:23,124 --> 01:33:27,067
[SPEAKER_04]: So now, in memorandum of a living saint, here you go.

1471
01:33:27,587 --> 01:33:28,648
[SPEAKER_04]: A moment of silence, please.

1472
01:33:28,668 --> 01:33:32,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1473
01:33:38,311 --> 01:33:41,116
Thanks for watching!

1474
01:34:01,619 --> 01:34:05,943
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood, a beautiful day for a neighbor.

1475
01:34:06,323 --> 01:34:08,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you be mine?

1476
01:34:08,265 --> 01:34:10,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you be mine?

1477
01:34:10,607 --> 01:34:15,131
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a neighborly day in this beauty wood, a neighborly day for a beauty.

1478
01:34:15,591 --> 01:34:17,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you be mine?

1479
01:34:17,473 --> 01:34:19,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you be mine?

1480
01:34:20,055 --> 01:34:23,058
[SPEAKER_11]: I have always wanted to have a neighbor just like you.

1481
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:39,327
[SPEAKER_11]: I've always wanted to live in the neighborhood with you So let's make the most of this beautiful day Since we're together, we might as well say Could you be mine?

1482
01:34:39,347 --> 01:34:40,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you be mine?

1483
01:34:40,908 --> 01:34:42,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Won't you be my neighbor?

1484
01:34:42,809 --> 01:34:46,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Won't you please?

1485
01:34:46,451 --> 01:34:47,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Won't you please?

1486
01:34:48,512 --> 01:34:51,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Please won't you be my neighbor?

1487
01:34:55,131 --> 01:34:58,495
[SPEAKER_11]: My television neighbor, I'm glad we're together again.

1488
01:37:14,161 --> 01:37:14,866
[SPEAKER_01]: Kale Kale Kutta

1489
01:38:11,621 --> 01:38:12,481
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, we're back.

1490
01:38:12,581 --> 01:38:15,182
[SPEAKER_14]: I have food in my mouth.

1491
01:38:37,691 --> 01:38:38,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm eating these combos.

1492
01:38:38,851 --> 01:38:39,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody left.

1493
01:38:40,492 --> 01:38:42,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had combos in a long time.

1494
01:38:42,972 --> 01:38:45,433
[SPEAKER_04]: And I swear to God, this is some of the most addicting shit in the world.

1495
01:38:46,033 --> 01:38:47,834
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I know is more addicting than those to me?

1496
01:38:47,874 --> 01:38:50,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, when I was in middle school, do you know what the snack was?

1497
01:38:50,555 --> 01:38:50,775
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1498
01:38:51,235 --> 01:38:52,396
[SPEAKER_02]: The Everlasting Gobstopper.

1499
01:38:54,576 --> 01:38:56,517
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but we used to take them out to see what color they changed.

1500
01:38:57,586 --> 01:38:58,807
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the coolest.

1501
01:38:59,047 --> 01:39:00,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And I liked it when they were in the middle.

1502
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:01,429
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

1503
01:39:01,929 --> 01:39:06,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I love all of you from Starmen.net because I want Mother64 to come out.

1504
01:39:06,072 --> 01:39:09,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just about to say, we have all these new people in the chat room tonight.

1505
01:39:09,535 --> 01:39:11,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to figure out where the hell they're all from.

1506
01:39:12,056 --> 01:39:17,080
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I looked and somebody mentioned a site that they were all from, Starmen.net.

1507
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:20,062
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's like, oh my god, it's an Earthbound site.

1508
01:39:20,302 --> 01:39:21,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Earthbound.

1509
01:39:21,703 --> 01:39:24,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, seriously, I almost love Earthbound more than I do DDR.

1510
01:39:25,206 --> 01:39:26,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Earthbound was the shit.

1511
01:39:26,206 --> 01:39:26,727
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1512
01:39:27,967 --> 01:39:39,695
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, for people who actually have emulators, I've heard this, because I know that the guy who did Robotech Crystal Dreams has as much of the game that they had programmed out in ROM format for these emulators.

1513
01:39:40,115 --> 01:39:43,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been hearing that there was a prototype ROM for Mother 64.

1514
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:44,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1515
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:49,181
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been looking for it, so if any of you have it, please freaking send it to me.

1516
01:39:49,281 --> 01:39:50,661
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a little section here on EB64.

1517
01:39:51,202 --> 01:39:51,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me click.

1518
01:39:51,782 --> 01:39:52,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm clicking here.

1519
01:39:53,522 --> 01:39:57,123
[SPEAKER_04]: That they were going to plan a sequel, and there's little cute little screenshots.

1520
01:39:59,103 --> 01:40:00,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the hell didn't this come out?

1521
01:40:00,824 --> 01:40:01,504
[SPEAKER_04]: F Nintendo.

1522
01:40:01,764 --> 01:40:03,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Why aren't we getting one of these on GameCube?

1523
01:40:04,644 --> 01:40:06,925
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what frustrated me is every time I started Earthbound...

1524
01:40:07,765 --> 01:40:08,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Animal Crossing Town, Onet

1525
01:40:28,576 --> 01:40:29,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, that's cool.

1526
01:40:29,617 --> 01:40:33,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's, that was the shit when Ness was, ended up being in Smash Brothers.

1527
01:40:34,503 --> 01:40:36,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I own with Ness and Smash Brothers.

1528
01:40:36,505 --> 01:40:38,687
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm starting my non-soda drinking tomorrow.

1529
01:40:39,568 --> 01:40:42,852
[SPEAKER_04]: All you have to do is sit there and you just PK fire the shit out of everybody.

1530
01:40:42,872 --> 01:40:43,793
[SPEAKER_20]: PK fire!

1531
01:40:45,595 --> 01:40:50,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Which reminds me, they're having a sale on Super Smash Brothers right now for like 29 bucks at Fry's and I'm so excited.

1532
01:40:53,379 --> 01:40:54,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, guess what?

1533
01:40:54,539 --> 01:40:56,939
[SPEAKER_02]: They sent us the biggest joke in the universe for free.

1534
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:57,660
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1535
01:40:57,700 --> 01:40:58,900
[SPEAKER_02]: A request for PS2.

1536
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:03,821
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's the great thing about my man managing GameStop.

1537
01:41:04,461 --> 01:41:06,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we get free crap games for free.

1538
01:41:06,982 --> 01:41:10,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we got BMX XXX for free.

1539
01:41:10,923 --> 01:41:12,423
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they sent us Evercrack.

1540
01:41:13,144 --> 01:41:14,024
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm laughing at it.

1541
01:41:16,584 --> 01:41:18,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's asking if you can borrow BMX XXX.

1542
01:41:22,535 --> 01:41:26,138
[SPEAKER_04]: When people in here don't talk with microphones, it's hard for the folks to understand what's going on.

1543
01:41:27,098 --> 01:41:29,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I borrow a BMX Triple X?

1544
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:30,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Much better.

1545
01:41:30,341 --> 01:41:31,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Only if you have an Xbox.

1546
01:41:33,263 --> 01:41:34,243
[SPEAKER_02]: You can come over and play, though.

1547
01:41:35,364 --> 01:41:37,646
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have some of the stripper stuff unlocked.

1548
01:41:40,488 --> 01:41:40,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

1549
01:41:41,488 --> 01:41:44,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, another neat thing for all of you who have a GameCube.

1550
01:41:44,911 --> 01:41:46,512
[SPEAKER_02]: A little device called the Freeloader.

1551
01:41:47,449 --> 01:41:49,010
[SPEAKER_02]: The freeloader is a little disc.

1552
01:41:49,251 --> 01:41:52,033
[SPEAKER_02]: It works like the one that they had for the Dreamcast.

1553
01:41:52,593 --> 01:41:57,558
[SPEAKER_02]: You put in your disc, you load the disc, then you put in your Japanese game, and lo and behold, it works!

1554
01:41:58,398 --> 01:42:02,042
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't have to need dinky little switches in the back of your GameCube.

1555
01:42:02,522 --> 01:42:05,384
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I got to see Zelda before everybody in this room.

1556
01:42:08,047 --> 01:42:08,687
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.

1557
01:42:11,329 --> 01:42:13,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no, unless you've been playing the demo at GameStop.

1558
01:42:16,778 --> 01:42:23,980
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, it's actually, I thought that I was gonna, see I was still feeling, you know, a little bit weird about that game just because Link looks like a dork.

1559
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:29,281
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you see the game in action, it's so freaking cool.

1560
01:42:29,921 --> 01:42:36,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you're in the dungeon and the, you know, to cross like the lava, you throw bottles of water at the lava and it cools it.

1561
01:42:36,603 --> 01:42:38,583
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can ride them up jets of lava, it's so cool.

1562
01:42:40,184 --> 01:42:46,225
[SPEAKER_10]: I was telling you about Dark Cloud earlier, that was another thing I was cool about is all the dungeons are randomly generated throughout the game.

1563
01:42:47,874 --> 01:43:00,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, right now I'm still trying to go back and finish Final Fantasy X, because I have this habit with any Final Fantasy game that I rush all the way through it just because I play really smart when I play.

1564
01:43:01,503 --> 01:43:10,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm at the first Unalesca battle, and well, you know, Auron is at 4,000 hit points, Tidus is at 2,100.

1565
01:43:12,290 --> 01:43:12,870
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

1566
01:43:13,010 --> 01:43:13,811
[SPEAKER_02]: That's way too little.

1567
01:43:13,871 --> 01:43:15,912
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm supposed to be at, what, 6,000 hit points by now.

1568
01:43:16,465 --> 01:43:16,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Xenosaga

1569
01:43:33,237 --> 01:43:39,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw Xenosaga last year at March Madness, coming to think of it, when I was staying at Tyzone.

1570
01:43:40,163 --> 01:43:47,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the incredibly long cinematic intro to Xenosaga, and I was absolutely uninterested in it.

1571
01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:51,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was pretty, but I'd never played Xenogears, so Xenosaga means nothing to me.

1572
01:43:51,653 --> 01:43:55,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Xenosaga does nothing like Xenogears, though.

1573
01:43:55,877 --> 01:44:00,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Other big news is, uh, Konami changed their logo.

1574
01:44:02,291 --> 01:44:04,817
[SPEAKER_10]: And they lost their stupid little red yellow flag.

1575
01:44:07,034 --> 01:44:10,097
[SPEAKER_06]: It was cool, like, the little walkie guy was cool.

1576
01:44:10,257 --> 01:44:17,282
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, like, at the beginning of Dracula X2, also known in the U.S., and none of us who ever had the game in the U.S.

1577
01:44:17,362 --> 01:44:25,909
[SPEAKER_02]: knows about this, for Castlevania Symphony of the Night, for the Japanese one, the Japanese Konami logo, the two little squiggly lines walk across the screen and it goes do-do-do-do-do-do.

1578
01:44:26,009 --> 01:44:29,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that, that was also the same in Beat Mania 2nd, also.

1579
01:44:29,532 --> 01:44:29,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1580
01:44:29,913 --> 01:44:30,853
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where I saw it.

1581
01:44:30,873 --> 01:44:31,914
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was a cool thing.

1582
01:44:31,994 --> 01:44:32,354
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um...

1583
01:44:33,275 --> 01:44:39,577
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, a little Baymani reference to this, the song, what was it, Make a Jam?

1584
01:44:40,797 --> 01:44:45,318
[SPEAKER_02]: The effects in that song are taken from the little walking Konami logo thing.

1585
01:44:45,719 --> 01:44:46,219
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

1586
01:44:46,659 --> 01:44:46,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1587
01:44:47,039 --> 01:44:50,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Konami's new logo is about as exciting as Namco's logo.

1588
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:54,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Namco all by itself is cool because of Pac-Man.

1589
01:44:54,681 --> 01:44:57,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but the logo is so boring.

1590
01:44:58,458 --> 01:45:01,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami's new logo is about as exciting as watching cheese ferment.

1591
01:45:02,482 --> 01:45:05,524
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about as exciting as the Jaguar.

1592
01:45:06,425 --> 01:45:09,007
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about as exciting as this radio program.

1593
01:45:09,187 --> 01:45:09,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Virtual Boy.

1594
01:45:10,949 --> 01:45:14,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Virtual Boy is more exciting than the new Konami logo.

1595
01:45:15,072 --> 01:45:20,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, okay, the Virtual Boy gives me a headache.

1596
01:45:20,296 --> 01:45:22,118
[SPEAKER_02]: The new Konami logo makes me want to throw up.

1597
01:45:23,107 --> 01:45:29,033
[SPEAKER_10]: In other news, Poppin' Music 9 came out and it's cool.

1598
01:45:29,533 --> 01:45:38,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Poppin' Music Best Hits also is out with brand new V-Rare CD number 4, which is also cool.

1599
01:45:40,373 --> 01:45:47,917
[SPEAKER_10]: and the Absolute guitar version is supposed to be on New Poppin' Music and also there's new Des Rho songs.

1600
01:45:48,517 --> 01:45:50,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Des Rho being the person that I can tie.

1601
01:45:50,979 --> 01:45:54,901
[SPEAKER_04]: I did get the long version of that rock version of Absolute so we'll play that next break.

1602
01:45:55,361 --> 01:45:55,741
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1603
01:45:56,742 --> 01:45:57,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.

1604
01:46:00,615 --> 01:46:06,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air, dead air.

1605
01:46:06,198 --> 01:46:11,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Can somebody download the Death Row songs and like set me up with them?

1606
01:46:11,541 --> 01:46:15,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Because all I have is Daikin Kai and I want to hear more stuff by them, but I can't download 30 megabytes on a 56K.

1607
01:46:15,863 --> 01:46:17,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know where and I'll do it.

1608
01:46:17,384 --> 01:46:18,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know where and I'll do it.

1609
01:46:19,266 --> 01:46:24,491
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1610
01:46:38,968 --> 01:46:40,130
[SPEAKER_02]: We had crumpling noises.

1611
01:46:40,430 --> 01:46:41,471
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell was that?

1612
01:46:41,972 --> 01:46:49,221
[SPEAKER_10]: I keep moving the fucking cord over goddamn food that's in the middle here because it's about to tip over, and so I just move the food instead, you know.

1613
01:46:50,743 --> 01:46:51,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Being proactive.

1614
01:46:53,466 --> 01:46:54,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Ness for president.

1615
01:46:56,570 --> 01:46:57,632
[SPEAKER_22]: You poor deprived child.

1616
01:46:59,042 --> 01:47:12,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, whatever happened to that guy, um, whatever happened to the guy that used to be on the Nintendo show, that guy, the Nintendo show, the guy with the zapper, the zapper guy.

1617
01:47:12,608 --> 01:47:14,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Captain N. Captain N, whatever happened to him?

1618
01:47:14,809 --> 01:47:23,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I downloaded the episode of Captain N where he went to the Zelda universe, and it had Link and Zelda, but they were, like, much taller, but it was the same voices.

1619
01:47:24,617 --> 01:47:25,137
[SPEAKER_02]: That was cool.

1620
01:47:25,517 --> 01:47:34,662
[SPEAKER_02]: But the episode sucks because I cannot go back and watch Captain N now that I know so much more about the background stories of these characters because Simon Belmont, okay, they had him as being this pretentious asshole.

1621
01:47:35,302 --> 01:47:39,504
[SPEAKER_02]: When he's really supposed to be all honorable, I'm a vampire hunter and I'm a Belmont and damn, I'm cool.

1622
01:47:39,564 --> 01:47:40,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck that, dude.

1623
01:47:40,264 --> 01:47:42,045
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what's going to be awesome is that fucking movie.

1624
01:47:42,065 --> 01:47:42,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Mega High, by the way.

1625
01:47:43,166 --> 01:47:44,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Van Helsing, the movie.

1626
01:47:44,866 --> 01:47:45,607
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be awesome.

1627
01:47:45,627 --> 01:47:45,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh.

1628
01:47:46,812 --> 01:47:54,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, wasn't the Captain N, didn't they play that during that horrible show where they'd have the two people compete in video game contests?

1629
01:47:54,574 --> 01:47:56,235
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Captain N was its own show.

1630
01:47:56,535 --> 01:48:00,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, because I remember they had a show where they did that.

1631
01:48:00,176 --> 01:48:04,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Captain N was even okay for a while, but they jumped the shark when they introduced Game Boy.

1632
01:48:04,517 --> 01:48:05,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

1633
01:48:05,637 --> 01:48:06,477
[SPEAKER_02]: As a person.

1634
01:48:08,978 --> 01:48:12,459
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was a Game Boy, and they would ride the Game Boy like a flying carpet.

1635
01:48:13,875 --> 01:48:16,837
[SPEAKER_02]: and NakedMan would always say Mega High and Kid Icarus was stupid.

1636
01:48:17,318 --> 01:48:18,078
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty bad.

1637
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:21,361
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd have Pit there and he'd be like, Hi, I'm Kid Icarus, but I'm not Pit.

1638
01:48:22,422 --> 01:48:24,723
[SPEAKER_04]: John Fields wanted us to plug CaptainN.net.

1639
01:48:25,884 --> 01:48:26,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy.

1640
01:48:27,205 --> 01:48:28,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I'm going to go to that site.

1641
01:48:28,767 --> 01:48:30,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I think that we should do the cage match now.

1642
01:48:32,489 --> 01:48:33,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Match game or something, God.

1643
01:48:33,650 --> 01:48:35,852
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what other show I remember though from the 80s?

1644
01:48:36,593 --> 01:48:37,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Kid Video.

1645
01:48:38,074 --> 01:48:39,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Freaking Kid Video was the best.

1646
01:48:40,310 --> 01:48:40,710
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1647
01:48:40,730 --> 01:48:44,192
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't understood one topic that we've discussed.

1648
01:48:44,472 --> 01:48:45,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you a baby.

1649
01:48:45,913 --> 01:48:46,933
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole night.

1650
01:48:47,754 --> 01:48:51,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Jay Kinetic actually says here, he says, he married Kid Video.

1651
01:48:51,736 --> 01:48:52,576
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what happened to Captain Eddie.

1652
01:48:52,616 --> 01:48:53,436
[SPEAKER_04]: He married Kid Video.

1653
01:48:53,456 --> 01:48:55,317
[SPEAKER_04]: They live in the Castro now and run a small bookstore.

1654
01:48:57,738 --> 01:48:59,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Kid Video was the name of the band.

1655
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:02,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe he married the whole band.

1656
01:49:02,881 --> 01:49:03,201
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1657
01:49:06,803 --> 01:49:08,384
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I remember the intro to that song.

1658
01:49:08,624 --> 01:49:08,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.

1659
01:49:08,965 --> 01:49:09,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's skip to the cage match.

1660
01:49:09,565 --> 01:49:12,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would play, like, you know, horrible 80s videos afterwards.

1661
01:49:15,729 --> 01:49:17,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, do not play track one or two.

1662
01:49:17,631 --> 01:49:18,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not play track two.

1663
01:49:19,032 --> 01:49:20,052
[SPEAKER_02]: It will blow out your speakers.

1664
01:49:22,454 --> 01:49:24,095
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the tracks will show up as the game.

1665
01:49:24,115 --> 01:49:27,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, it was... Back to the day, yeah.

1666
01:49:32,557 --> 01:49:41,380
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to know what's really cool is if you put in the Japanese version of the Dracula X2 and then put in Castlevania the Knight, he actually says exactly the same thing, just one's in English and the other.

1667
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:44,721
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a perfect translation on that.

1668
01:49:44,761 --> 01:49:45,862
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no track 14.

1669
01:49:46,662 --> 01:49:47,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the last track?

1670
01:49:47,522 --> 01:49:48,682
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the last track.

1671
01:49:48,702 --> 01:49:49,263
[SPEAKER_04]: So is it track 13?

1672
01:49:51,061 --> 01:49:52,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever, okay.

1673
01:49:52,582 --> 01:49:54,943
[SPEAKER_10]: It shows up as track 14 on mine.

1674
01:49:55,523 --> 01:49:58,344
[SPEAKER_10]: If it ain't it, then I'll just get bitch slapped.

1675
01:49:58,804 --> 01:50:02,826
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, track 13 plus a dated track, so track 14.

1676
01:50:03,246 --> 01:50:04,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we got that settled now.

1677
01:50:04,586 --> 01:50:04,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

1678
01:50:05,547 --> 01:50:07,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Then, let's get it on.

1679
01:50:08,508 --> 01:50:09,928
[SPEAKER_04]: The cage match, everybody.

1680
01:50:10,869 --> 01:50:11,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray.

1681
01:50:11,889 --> 01:50:12,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob?

1682
01:50:15,611 --> 01:50:16,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1683
01:50:17,466 --> 01:50:17,886
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm too lazy.

1684
01:50:17,906 --> 01:50:19,087
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've been to this one before.

1685
01:50:19,107 --> 01:50:19,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's your house?

1686
01:50:19,667 --> 01:50:20,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell people on Twitter.

1687
01:50:44,207 --> 01:50:46,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so anyway, we'll talk about where Jamie lives.

1688
01:50:46,648 --> 01:50:48,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, but next week the show's going to be displaced.

1689
01:50:48,308 --> 01:50:50,109
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be at the house of Jamie.

1690
01:50:51,829 --> 01:50:55,631
[SPEAKER_04]: But it'll be all the same fun and crazy pornography antics that you're used to.

1691
01:50:56,371 --> 01:50:57,111
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll have Shermie.

1692
01:50:58,291 --> 01:50:58,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Word.

1693
01:50:58,892 --> 01:51:00,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so anyway, back to the cage match.

1694
01:51:03,975 --> 01:51:25,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, last week on the cage match, in a very much surprise win, I was very surprised at this, but Chatroom has some weird tastes sometimes, but no, this is actually a pretty good song, this is a good one to win, but man, against, come on, Legend of Trance, I thought for sure that would win, and then we had the Love of the Angel, I thought the dedication would have votes built into it, but apparently...

1695
01:51:26,434 --> 01:51:27,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Did Charum have other ideas in mind?

1696
01:51:27,975 --> 01:51:28,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is the winner.

1697
01:51:28,816 --> 01:51:30,877
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Wild Side with Heaven is a Place on Earth.

1698
01:51:30,917 --> 01:51:33,479
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first song you can vote for in tonight's cage match.

1699
01:51:33,819 --> 01:51:34,659
[SPEAKER_04]: The reigning champion.

1700
01:51:34,699 --> 01:51:35,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a clip.

1701
01:52:28,044 --> 01:52:31,507
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's the first song you can vote for is Wild Side with Heaven is a Place on Earth.

1702
01:52:32,027 --> 01:52:37,431
[SPEAKER_04]: The way the cage match works, by the way, for those of you who are kind of new to our chat room and the show, we're going to play three songs.

1703
01:52:37,771 --> 01:52:39,833
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, we play a clip of last week's winner.

1704
01:52:39,853 --> 01:52:43,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we'll play two full-length songs, two new songs that are chosen by the hosts.

1705
01:52:44,036 --> 01:52:45,717
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys vote on your favorite.

1706
01:52:45,757 --> 01:52:46,358
[SPEAKER_04]: And the winner...

1707
01:52:46,978 --> 01:52:56,383
[SPEAKER_04]: goes into rotation on Orange Lounge Radio's music show that plays all week long when we're not here with all your favorite DDR, 2DX, Tasmania music and the Cage Match winner.

1708
01:52:56,903 --> 01:53:01,126
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that being said, you can't submit your votes until the end of the third song, though.

1709
01:53:01,506 --> 01:53:05,128
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't send them yet because we've got two more to go, including Loki's Choice.

1710
01:53:05,208 --> 01:53:06,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?

1711
01:53:07,449 --> 01:53:11,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Tonight we have one of my most favorite Grant songs.

1712
01:53:12,895 --> 01:53:18,641
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Sasha with his very, I think, pretty famous Expander.

1713
01:53:19,662 --> 01:53:21,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and let me know if this is the wrong one on X-Things.

1714
01:53:21,844 --> 01:53:23,066
[SPEAKER_04]: We're kind of trying to pull this from CD.

1715
01:53:23,086 --> 01:53:24,427
[SPEAKER_04]: This might be the wrong track, but here we go.

1716
01:53:24,787 --> 01:53:27,671
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Sasha with Expander, Loki's pick.

1717
01:57:34,759 --> 01:57:39,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that was Sasha with Expander, that was Loki's pick for tonight's cage match.

1718
01:57:39,762 --> 01:57:41,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around the room and get our thoughts on it.

1719
01:57:41,423 --> 01:57:41,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie?

1720
01:57:42,183 --> 01:57:43,464
[SPEAKER_20]: Competitive, but nice.

1721
01:57:44,125 --> 01:57:46,066
[SPEAKER_20]: I give it a 7.5.

1722
01:57:46,466 --> 01:57:46,066
7.5.

1723
01:57:47,206 --> 01:57:47,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnny?

1724
01:57:50,889 --> 01:57:52,590
[SPEAKER_04]: You're eating, alright, we'll come back to you, Johnny.

1725
01:57:53,090 --> 01:57:54,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Loki?

1726
01:57:54,651 --> 01:57:56,352
[SPEAKER_10]: I still like it, so I'm giving it a 9.

1727
01:57:58,713 --> 01:58:01,315
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was actually pretty decent, so I give it like 8.5.

1728
01:58:03,021 --> 01:58:03,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave?

1729
01:58:05,022 --> 01:58:06,063
[SPEAKER_09]: I give it an 8.

1730
01:58:07,484 --> 01:58:08,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Any reason why?

1731
01:58:08,104 --> 01:58:14,288
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't really listening, and I can't say it was bad or good, but I trust Loki's judgment.

1732
01:58:14,868 --> 01:58:18,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I say, I agree with Jamie, it was a little bit repetitive, I give it a 7.

1733
01:58:18,991 --> 01:58:19,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnny?

1734
01:58:20,111 --> 01:58:23,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go around the majority and pick the average, I'm going to say 7.

1735
01:58:24,134 --> 01:58:24,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1736
01:58:25,154 --> 01:58:25,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was...

1737
01:58:28,613 --> 01:58:30,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so that's two down, one more to go.

1738
01:58:31,555 --> 01:58:33,757
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the last pick for tonight's cage match.

1739
01:58:33,797 --> 01:58:35,338
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a song I downloaded.

1740
01:58:35,418 --> 01:58:43,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Billy, the guy that was here earlier, Billy the Big Homo, who told us the Mardi Gras story, suggested I download this song, and it ain't too bad, and I could totally see it in DDR.

1741
01:58:43,564 --> 01:58:45,045
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought you guys might enjoy it.

1742
01:58:46,826 --> 01:58:49,848
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is... No, I should put Kylie Minogue in, though, huh?

1743
01:58:50,188 --> 01:58:50,588
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1744
01:58:50,689 --> 01:58:51,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck that.

1745
01:58:51,529 --> 01:58:52,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck this pick.

1746
01:58:52,950 --> 01:58:53,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I've changed my mind.

1747
01:58:54,030 --> 01:58:56,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I have done a last minute change my mind pick.

1748
01:58:56,792 --> 01:58:58,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I want Kylie in the cage match.

1749
01:58:58,912 --> 01:58:59,773
[SPEAKER_20]: I know a song I want to hear.

1750
01:58:59,793 --> 01:59:02,734
[SPEAKER_04]: So, my pick for tonight's cage match.

1751
01:59:02,754 --> 01:59:03,614
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I hope I can find it.

1752
01:59:03,654 --> 01:59:05,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I gotta... No, no, no.

1753
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:06,996
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a different one.

1754
01:59:07,256 --> 01:59:08,536
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really fucked up.

1755
01:59:08,696 --> 01:59:10,697
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm kind of going really random.

1756
01:59:13,178 --> 01:59:14,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this is my pick.

1757
01:59:14,839 --> 01:59:16,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I downloaded something for Billy and I forgot to bring it.

1758
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:19,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the lingerie commercial to download.

1759
01:59:20,581 --> 01:59:22,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I downloaded it for Billy and I didn't give it to him.

1760
01:59:23,416 --> 01:59:28,318
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, okay, I'm being told that I don't get it, that that track is one of the mainstays of Trance and all that.

1761
01:59:28,338 --> 01:59:29,178
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been around for eight years.

1762
01:59:29,658 --> 01:59:30,038
[SPEAKER_04]: So what?

1763
01:59:30,078 --> 01:59:30,898
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still repetitive.

1764
01:59:30,918 --> 01:59:31,639
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my opinion.

1765
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:32,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Eight years is old.

1766
01:59:32,979 --> 01:59:33,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Eight years is old.

1767
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:34,840
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1768
01:59:35,860 --> 01:59:36,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I changed my mind.

1769
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:39,461
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my pick instead, because I want to get really random.

1770
01:59:39,481 --> 01:59:41,002
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one was too mainstream.

1771
01:59:41,022 --> 01:59:49,264
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Kylie Minogue with a song that Robbie Williams helped her co-write, and it's really messed up, and the video's cool, and it looks like Xanadu.

1772
01:59:49,284 --> 01:59:49,785
[SPEAKER_04]: It really does.

1773
01:59:49,805 --> 01:59:50,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Billy told me.

1774
01:59:50,445 --> 01:59:51,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to download this one.

1775
01:59:51,466 --> 01:59:55,383
[SPEAKER_04]: This is called Your Disco Needs You, and this is my pick for tonight's cage match.

1776
01:59:55,423 --> 01:59:55,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy.

1777
02:00:36,010 --> 02:00:39,293
Thank you for watching

1778
02:01:18,621 --> 02:01:34,588
[SPEAKER_15]: You're sold on vanity, but that's so see-through Take your body to the floor, your disco needs you From soul to soul, your disco needs you

1779
02:01:58,168 --> 02:01:59,210
Thanks for watching!

1780
02:04:29,878 --> 02:04:34,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Kylie Minogue with Your Disco Needs You, going around the room starting with Jamie.

1781
02:04:35,320 --> 02:04:38,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, I'm going to paraphrase Happy Bunny when I say this.

1782
02:04:39,702 --> 02:04:41,003
[SPEAKER_02]: That song just made me throw up a little.

1783
02:04:41,283 --> 02:04:44,264
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets like a four.

1784
02:04:44,284 --> 02:04:48,386
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was pretty tight.

1785
02:04:49,026 --> 02:04:50,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah!

1786
02:04:50,467 --> 02:04:52,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnny knows good music when he hears it.

1787
02:04:52,467 --> 02:04:55,989
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go ahead and give that an eight and a half.

1788
02:04:56,249 --> 02:04:56,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.

1789
02:04:56,769 --> 02:04:58,090
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty tight.

1790
02:04:59,969 --> 02:05:03,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I like Robin Williams and Kylie Minogue.

1791
02:05:03,413 --> 02:05:04,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Robbie Williams, there's a difference.

1792
02:05:05,935 --> 02:05:06,516
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

1793
02:05:07,177 --> 02:05:07,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1794
02:05:07,597 --> 02:05:12,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I loved it when he sang Millennium.

1795
02:05:13,443 --> 02:05:15,325
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, Kylie Minogue is pretty cool.

1796
02:05:16,046 --> 02:05:18,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though I don't like her for any of her music.

1797
02:05:18,655 --> 02:05:27,780
[SPEAKER_10]: But that movie, um, or, yeah, I'd like to think of it as a movie because most of the movies I've seen suck, and that song, too, did suck.

1798
02:05:28,381 --> 02:05:29,361
[SPEAKER_10]: It sucked pretty bad.

1799
02:05:29,481 --> 02:05:34,705
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, yeah, it sucked as badly as Dave was sucking on that bottle.

1800
02:05:35,605 --> 02:05:37,686
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was pretty bad.

1801
02:05:39,227 --> 02:05:40,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Not as hard as Candace Cameron, though.

1802
02:05:40,988 --> 02:05:44,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, that's a toughie.

1803
02:05:46,528 --> 02:05:49,130
[SPEAKER_10]: No, she's a slut, so that's different.

1804
02:05:49,150 --> 02:05:53,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I give it a 2 out of... I give it a nice 2 out of 10.

1805
02:05:53,972 --> 02:05:54,212
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1806
02:05:54,913 --> 02:05:55,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, you don't know good music.

1807
02:05:56,274 --> 02:05:56,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

1808
02:05:57,174 --> 02:05:59,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, that's all I'm hearing, and yeah.

1809
02:05:59,715 --> 02:06:04,898
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw that Candace Cameron chick on that I Love the 80s thing on VH1.

1810
02:06:05,819 --> 02:06:12,383
[SPEAKER_10]: That was so... The last thing I remember her in was that stupid movie where she got... Hi, hi, hi, page match, Kylie, disco.

1811
02:06:14,955 --> 02:06:17,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I lost interest in that song in, like, the first ten seconds.

1812
02:06:19,299 --> 02:06:23,482
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could give it negatives, I would, but I'll just say, like, one.

1813
02:06:27,225 --> 02:06:29,627
[SPEAKER_02]: We were holding a whole conversation during that song.

1814
02:06:30,808 --> 02:06:34,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we were talking, we started off talking about, like, the Dreamcast stuff.

1815
02:06:34,931 --> 02:06:36,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we were talking about Dreamcast and Vibribin.

1816
02:06:37,580 --> 02:06:38,941
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how bad that song was.

1817
02:06:39,041 --> 02:06:39,402
[SPEAKER_06]: I give it a 1.

1818
02:06:39,662 --> 02:06:42,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, whatever, whatever.

1819
02:06:42,244 --> 02:06:44,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I give it a 10.

1820
02:06:44,666 --> 02:06:49,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to retract mine and give it a half a point.

1821
02:06:49,911 --> 02:06:51,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I give it a 30 then.

1822
02:06:54,074 --> 02:06:55,055
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, all right.

1823
02:06:55,075 --> 02:06:56,016
[SPEAKER_04]: He gives it a 100.

1824
02:06:56,056 --> 02:06:56,396
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1825
02:06:57,397 --> 02:06:59,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give you the wave first.

1826
02:07:00,700 --> 02:07:07,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that song, you guys, just, you don't understand quirky music.

1827
02:07:07,405 --> 02:07:09,106
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys just don't understand quirky music.

1828
02:07:09,126 --> 02:07:09,707
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it is.

1829
02:07:09,727 --> 02:07:11,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand it.

1830
02:07:11,408 --> 02:07:11,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

1831
02:07:12,328 --> 02:07:13,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Ole, ole, ole.

1832
02:07:14,590 --> 02:07:19,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, I understand quirky music, and that wasn't quirky, that was vomiting.

1833
02:07:20,594 --> 02:07:22,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I give it a 10, because Kylie Minogue owns all of you.

1834
02:07:22,936 --> 02:07:23,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1835
02:07:23,356 --> 02:07:24,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so let's review.

1836
02:07:24,437 --> 02:07:24,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1837
02:07:25,278 --> 02:07:26,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what you can vote for tonight.

1838
02:07:26,879 --> 02:07:29,521
[SPEAKER_04]: You can vote for last week's winner, Wild Side, Heaven is a Place on Earth.

1839
02:07:36,195 --> 02:07:38,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can vote for Sasha with Expander.

1840
02:07:44,687 --> 02:07:47,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can vote for Kylie Minogue with your Disco Need You.

1841
02:07:54,048 --> 02:07:59,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, send your votes in now for the Orange Lounge cage match.

1842
02:07:59,792 --> 02:08:02,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Send those votes over private message to Sky.

1843
02:08:03,215 --> 02:08:06,817
[SPEAKER_04]: And we shall tally those votes up and have them for you in a few more minutes.

1844
02:08:08,278 --> 02:08:13,362
[SPEAKER_04]: So, alright, we got a good chunk of time left in the show.

1845
02:08:15,683 --> 02:08:16,964
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you talking about here?

1846
02:08:18,105 --> 02:08:18,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

1847
02:08:18,886 --> 02:08:19,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1848
02:08:33,980 --> 02:08:39,922
[SPEAKER_04]: I should check the email box, see if we have any new messages here.

1849
02:08:39,942 --> 02:08:41,843
[SPEAKER_04]: We have dead air here.

1850
02:08:43,824 --> 02:08:45,224
[SPEAKER_02]: The cheat is grounded.

1851
02:08:46,252 --> 02:08:49,834
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the light switch installed so you could turn the lights on and off.

1852
02:08:50,114 --> 02:08:51,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so you could throw light switch waves.

1853
02:08:52,675 --> 02:08:54,176
[SPEAKER_14]: I love that.

1854
02:08:55,616 --> 02:09:00,938
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we actually did have like this big Homestar Runner Fest over the weekend while Mel and Melody were over at my house.

1855
02:09:00,998 --> 02:09:05,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like, I sat down on that site for like 45 minutes just going over the stuff.

1856
02:09:05,180 --> 02:09:07,321
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite one was the way- I'M FREAKING CARMEN MIRANDA!

1857
02:09:09,042 --> 02:09:23,669
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite one was where the person's, where it was to the guy with the long name, to the song, and he said, for how long it took me to say your name, I could have painted a picture, and he goes out in the backyard and starts painting a picture, and he's all, this looks good, like put it in the art gallery or paint it for some guy's dad.

1858
02:09:24,429 --> 02:09:28,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that, from what I've heard, a lot of people haven't caught this particular section of HomestarRunner.com.

1859
02:09:28,991 --> 02:09:29,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one?

1860
02:09:29,771 --> 02:09:31,232
[SPEAKER_02]: The Marzipan's answering machine.

1861
02:09:31,272 --> 02:09:31,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I did.

1862
02:09:32,292 --> 02:09:33,853
[SPEAKER_02]: But I haven't talked to a lot of people who have.

1863
02:09:34,073 --> 02:09:36,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I went, like, there's a third thing I did.

1864
02:09:36,734 --> 02:09:37,575
[SPEAKER_02]: This call is...

1865
02:09:38,275 --> 02:09:41,079
[SPEAKER_22]: This call is not your boyfriend.

1866
02:09:41,179 --> 02:09:44,143
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the coolest thing ever.

1867
02:09:44,623 --> 02:09:45,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually sent an email.

1868
02:09:46,165 --> 02:09:48,809
[SPEAKER_22]: You have been diagnosed with serious problems.

1869
02:09:49,850 --> 02:09:51,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I sent Strong Bad an email.

1870
02:09:51,472 --> 02:09:53,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Leave your stereo on the front porch.

1871
02:09:53,895 --> 02:09:57,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, come back later or something.

1872
02:09:57,336 --> 02:09:58,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I sent an email to StrongBad.

1873
02:09:58,797 --> 02:10:03,378
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one that was saying, if someone made an RPG about you, what would your character be?

1874
02:10:03,898 --> 02:10:05,919
[SPEAKER_06]: It would just be interesting to see what he says to that one.

1875
02:10:06,099 --> 02:10:06,799
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, though?

1876
02:10:06,959 --> 02:10:08,900
[SPEAKER_02]: That actually brings up a point.

1877
02:10:09,120 --> 02:10:12,661
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were suddenly listed to the world of Dungeons & Dragons, what would your character class be?

1878
02:10:13,761 --> 02:10:20,503
[SPEAKER_06]: My character would be, like, some retarded... I would be some, like, retarded wizard, like Orc from He-Man.

1879
02:10:20,843 --> 02:10:22,464
[SPEAKER_02]: No, would you be, like, a wild mage then?

1880
02:10:23,124 --> 02:10:23,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1881
02:10:24,170 --> 02:10:25,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Wild Mages are cool.

1882
02:10:25,951 --> 02:10:26,651
[SPEAKER_02]: What about you?

1883
02:10:26,731 --> 02:10:27,752
[SPEAKER_02]: What would your character class be?

1884
02:10:28,652 --> 02:10:30,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I was an evil jester last time I played.

1885
02:10:30,974 --> 02:10:31,614
[SPEAKER_02]: An evil jester?

1886
02:10:31,794 --> 02:10:34,676
[SPEAKER_10]: An evil jester who had playing cards that turned people into stuff.

1887
02:10:35,136 --> 02:10:35,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Like jackasses.

1888
02:10:36,437 --> 02:10:36,897
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

1889
02:10:37,437 --> 02:10:41,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you were suddenly whisked to the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons, what would your character class be?

1890
02:10:41,479 --> 02:10:41,839
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1891
02:10:41,859 --> 02:10:44,421
[SPEAKER_09]: I never played it, so... Lesbian.

1892
02:10:45,754 --> 02:10:47,415
[SPEAKER_02]: A lesbian is not a character class.

1893
02:10:48,176 --> 02:10:50,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I played a lesbian ninja once.

1894
02:10:50,258 --> 02:10:53,761
[SPEAKER_04]: The one time I played D&D, I was a lesbian.

1895
02:10:54,081 --> 02:10:54,321
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

1896
02:10:55,982 --> 02:10:56,243
[SPEAKER_02]: No, wait.

1897
02:10:56,643 --> 02:10:58,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to play a lesbian ninja.

1898
02:10:59,165 --> 02:10:59,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, wait.

1899
02:10:59,925 --> 02:11:00,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1900
02:11:00,746 --> 02:11:01,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a beautiful lesbian.

1901
02:11:01,807 --> 02:11:05,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't D&D like the game where you just kind of make up shit and be like, hey, what's up?

1902
02:11:05,430 --> 02:11:07,291
[SPEAKER_05]: To be honest with you, I never got into D&D either.

1903
02:11:08,412 --> 02:11:11,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, hey, yeah, I'm cool.

1904
02:11:12,347 --> 02:11:15,469
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, yeah, I'm Tigger, I can play any song.

1905
02:11:15,489 --> 02:11:17,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Just describe what your person would do.

1906
02:11:18,772 --> 02:11:21,273
[SPEAKER_05]: My person, he wouldn't do much.

1907
02:11:21,394 --> 02:11:23,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, do they have, like, magicians or whatever?

1908
02:11:23,555 --> 02:11:25,116
[SPEAKER_02]: There's wizards, clerics.

1909
02:11:26,257 --> 02:11:27,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, a major wizard.

1910
02:11:27,518 --> 02:11:28,098
[SPEAKER_04]: This is good.

1911
02:11:28,439 --> 02:11:28,899
[SPEAKER_04]: This is good.

1912
02:11:29,159 --> 02:11:30,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's got a good idea here.

1913
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:32,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Or was it Zero that had the idea in turn?

1914
02:11:32,401 --> 02:11:32,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1915
02:11:32,722 --> 02:11:34,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yes, back in there, they were kind of thinking this.

1916
02:11:34,863 --> 02:11:37,385
[SPEAKER_04]: We should do this live on air as a segment, for instance, because we're desperate.

1917
02:11:37,405 --> 02:11:39,927
[SPEAKER_04]: We're coming up for new segments, because, you know, we can only... There's only...

1918
02:11:40,587 --> 02:11:44,211
[SPEAKER_04]: After some time, we're going to have done every listless topic we could possibly do.

1919
02:11:44,811 --> 02:11:50,717
[SPEAKER_04]: So, thinking of starting a D&D DDR game, and we can play it live on air.

1920
02:11:51,998 --> 02:11:52,879
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR D&D.

1921
02:11:53,580 --> 02:11:54,140
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1922
02:11:55,041 --> 02:11:56,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no, I'll tell you what.

1923
02:11:57,043 --> 02:12:04,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me sit down with freaking White Wolf Fools and I can make up the Pokemon style, you know, like in the game, DDR RPG.

1924
02:12:05,777 --> 02:12:06,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you're on.

1925
02:12:07,597 --> 02:12:08,578
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll play it live on air.

1926
02:12:08,638 --> 02:12:10,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put this and I'm not going to run it.

1927
02:12:12,799 --> 02:12:13,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, roll the dice.

1928
02:12:14,059 --> 02:12:14,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll the dice.

1929
02:12:14,679 --> 02:12:15,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Bam, I just got six greats.

1930
02:12:15,979 --> 02:12:16,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can just see it now.

1931
02:12:16,899 --> 02:12:21,460
[SPEAKER_06]: You like roll a dice and one says, I got 14 perfects and six greats.

1932
02:12:24,221 --> 02:12:28,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I would just, I think it would be cool for all of us to meet like one night a week.

1933
02:12:29,331 --> 02:12:33,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Put the microphones on over us really loud and, like, game on the computer.

1934
02:12:34,156 --> 02:12:36,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Sit in here, do tabletop gaming while everyone has to listen to us.

1935
02:12:36,438 --> 02:12:39,481
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just bring in Mario Party and listen to us play that live on air.

1936
02:12:39,501 --> 02:12:40,221
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great.

1937
02:12:40,521 --> 02:12:41,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Should have heard me earlier today.

1938
02:12:41,502 --> 02:12:42,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I choked Irene.

1939
02:12:45,606 --> 02:12:46,427
[SPEAKER_04]: She was being mean to me.

1940
02:12:48,467 --> 02:12:58,314
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to seriously get enough bandwidth to do a video feed because then what you can do is you can do a picture of what's on the TV as the video feed and hear us talking over it.

1941
02:12:58,594 --> 02:12:59,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you son of a bitch!

1942
02:12:59,855 --> 02:13:00,696
[SPEAKER_10]: That was my story!

1943
02:13:00,716 --> 02:13:01,476
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, stuff like that.

1944
02:13:01,977 --> 02:13:03,378
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be great, but we can't.

1945
02:13:03,398 --> 02:13:04,318
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, though?

1946
02:13:04,518 --> 02:13:08,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to sit and play D&D with my friends and I would always wear my black cloak over my head.

1947
02:13:09,782 --> 02:13:17,348
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd see this, like, see me huddled over with a black cloak over me, and all of a sudden this hand would creep out, throwing dice, and then go back, write something down.

1948
02:13:17,368 --> 02:13:19,029
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be fun to have a Super Smash Bros.

1949
02:13:19,049 --> 02:13:22,071
[SPEAKER_06]: like, tournament, and have people watch us go on about that.

1950
02:13:22,171 --> 02:13:23,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I would win all, I would win all of it.

1951
02:13:24,172 --> 02:13:24,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Two characters.

1952
02:13:26,034 --> 02:13:28,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Adult Link, Adult Link, and Sheik.

1953
02:13:30,457 --> 02:13:30,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Melee.

1954
02:13:30,957 --> 02:13:31,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Melee.

1955
02:13:33,319 --> 02:13:33,919
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be Ness.

1956
02:13:34,059 --> 02:13:34,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Ness.

1957
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:34,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1958
02:13:34,640 --> 02:13:34,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1959
02:13:36,843 --> 02:13:38,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Come near me and I will smack you with a bat.

1960
02:13:39,806 --> 02:13:41,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I have another character.

1961
02:13:41,207 --> 02:13:42,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually really good with a bunch of characters on that one.

1962
02:13:42,989 --> 02:13:47,052
[SPEAKER_02]: My other good one, who was my best one from the N64 one, was Kirby.

1963
02:13:47,753 --> 02:13:48,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Kirby will never die.

1964
02:13:49,034 --> 02:13:52,938
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what we should do is have a home run derby contest and see who can hit the furthest.

1965
02:13:53,418 --> 02:13:54,099
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1966
02:13:54,139 --> 02:13:56,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Home run derby on rival schools.

1967
02:13:57,021 --> 02:13:58,082
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I can't play that game.

1968
02:13:58,283 --> 02:13:59,504
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't read a damn thing.

1969
02:14:01,187 --> 02:14:01,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1970
02:14:02,448 --> 02:14:05,491
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually, you know what, on another show, play DDR Live on NetCam.

1971
02:14:05,511 --> 02:14:06,192
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually funny.

1972
02:14:06,212 --> 02:14:12,737
[SPEAKER_04]: The show that kind of preceded this, I guess some would consider Orange Lounge a spin-off of Under Sedation Live.org.

1973
02:14:12,877 --> 02:14:13,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Which still plays Saturday nights.

1974
02:14:13,978 --> 02:14:17,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Which still does play on Saturday nights, 630 to 930 Pacific Standard Time.

1975
02:14:17,261 --> 02:14:18,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Under Sedation Live.org.

1976
02:14:18,783 --> 02:14:22,786
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually did do a DDR show, which was kind of where this all came from.

1977
02:14:22,866 --> 02:14:25,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge actually kind of was birthed by that show.

1978
02:14:25,368 --> 02:14:26,950
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a guest more times than anybody.

1979
02:14:28,337 --> 02:14:30,658
[SPEAKER_04]: and we did play DDR Live on air and we had the cam and everything.

1980
02:14:30,678 --> 02:14:31,819
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty crazy.

1981
02:14:33,040 --> 02:14:33,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was around for that?

1982
02:14:34,020 --> 02:14:36,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if anybody who's listening to Orange Lounge was around for that show.

1983
02:14:37,022 --> 02:14:37,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1984
02:14:38,683 --> 02:14:41,684
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Orange Lounge in the fetal stage.

1985
02:14:41,784 --> 02:14:43,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Lab, save your question.

1986
02:14:43,205 --> 02:14:47,067
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do Ask Orange Lounge when we come back from the break because we have some new people listening tonight.

1987
02:14:49,108 --> 02:14:49,869
[SPEAKER_04]: You want some more points?

1988
02:14:49,889 --> 02:14:52,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's take a quick break, because I want to get the cage match finished up.

1989
02:14:52,631 --> 02:14:54,513
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to give people a chance to send in the last votes.

1990
02:14:54,753 --> 02:15:00,058
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to do a one-song break, because this is a five-minute song, but JB's been begging and begging me to play this, so fine.

1991
02:15:01,079 --> 02:15:03,581
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the sign with words, a dance mix.

1992
02:15:03,641 --> 02:15:04,782
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know what it's like.

1993
02:15:04,862 --> 02:15:06,043
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll hear it live on air.

1994
02:15:06,464 --> 02:15:07,925
[SPEAKER_04]: If it sucks, blame JB.

1995
02:15:07,985 --> 02:15:09,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, we've got to get to the absolute.

1996
02:15:09,326 --> 02:15:11,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll do absolute before the end of the show, I promise.

1997
02:15:11,669 --> 02:15:13,290
[SPEAKER_04]: The absolute guitar mix, we'll do that.

1998
02:15:16,152 --> 02:15:18,473
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the last chance to get in your votes for the cage match.

1999
02:15:18,493 --> 02:15:22,835
[SPEAKER_04]: If you haven't voted, you have 60 more seconds and then voting is closed or you die.

2000
02:15:24,196 --> 02:15:26,017
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we will be back.

2001
02:15:26,057 --> 02:15:26,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy.

2002
02:15:29,719 --> 02:15:41,304
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't come easy to me How can I find a way to make you see I love you words don't come easy

2003
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:45,341
[SPEAKER_14]: White White White

2004
02:18:45,714 --> 02:18:59,282
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't come easy to me How can I find a way To make you see Our lovey words Don't come easy Come on, touch me

2005
02:20:20,024 --> 02:20:22,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, some kind of mixed reaction from the chatroom on that one.

2006
02:20:22,926 --> 02:20:25,448
[SPEAKER_04]: The sign with words sent to us by JB by request.

2007
02:20:25,828 --> 02:20:28,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this is going to be the part now.

2008
02:20:28,650 --> 02:20:30,751
[SPEAKER_04]: We're tallying up your votes for the cage match.

2009
02:20:30,771 --> 02:20:38,736
[SPEAKER_04]: However, when we come back, we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge or Ask Johnny, Ask the Intern, Zero, or Ask Dave.

2010
02:20:38,976 --> 02:20:39,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Our delinquent.

2011
02:20:40,990 --> 02:20:42,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Bombay, you can ask Bombay.

2012
02:20:42,553 --> 02:20:45,237
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bombay, what kind of questions would you want to answer?

2013
02:20:45,297 --> 02:20:49,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Like things about freestyle, things about... Yeah, freestyle, because I'm trying to get in more to freestyle.

2014
02:20:50,304 --> 02:20:52,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to compete more, get more experience and all that.

2015
02:20:52,508 --> 02:20:54,050
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you guys know Dave and the intern by now.

2016
02:20:54,070 --> 02:20:54,511
[SPEAKER_04]: This is giant.

2017
02:20:54,969 --> 02:20:58,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Yo, yo, I go to McDonald's, not Delta Co.

2018
02:20:58,390 --> 02:20:59,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo, yo.

2019
02:21:00,350 --> 02:21:04,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, okay, so send us your questions over a private message to Sky, and we'll get to those.

2020
02:21:05,211 --> 02:21:11,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, if you're too lazy to be in the chat room, just send them over email, orangeloungeradio, all one word, at yahoo.com.

2021
02:21:12,012 --> 02:21:15,933
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can also always send us your comments or whatever else.

2022
02:21:15,993 --> 02:21:18,673
[SPEAKER_04]: So, something Bomani-related for you guys that I promised earlier.

2023
02:21:18,713 --> 02:21:21,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go, and we'll be back after this with Ask Orange Lounge.

2024
02:21:21,434 --> 02:21:22,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Send your questions now.

2025
02:25:37,893 --> 02:25:43,737
[SPEAKER_16]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

2026
02:25:49,482 --> 02:25:50,243
[SPEAKER_04]: We are back.

2027
02:25:50,663 --> 02:25:51,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope you enjoyed that.

2028
02:25:51,564 --> 02:25:56,068
[SPEAKER_04]: That absolute version, by the way, it's labeled as Taka featuring Good Cool.

2029
02:25:58,681 --> 02:26:05,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Rumor is that it might be a fake, however, somebody swore up and down to me they had a video of somebody playing that from Poppin' Music 9.

2030
02:26:05,806 --> 02:26:09,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, if that's a fake, that's one hell of a good fake.

2031
02:26:09,849 --> 02:26:15,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was going to say, I believe Tal said in the chat room, if it's a fake, it's a damn good fake, and I want more by that faker.

2032
02:26:16,773 --> 02:26:30,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, I seriously doubt that that's a fake because, I mean, hold on, it's absolute in guitar, and it doesn't sound like shit, and unlike M, you know, which obviously could have been made by anybody, but this is a lot better.

2033
02:26:30,638 --> 02:26:31,658
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see how this is a fake.

2034
02:26:33,179 --> 02:26:34,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, there you have it.

2035
02:26:34,840 --> 02:26:36,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it or not, fake or not.

2036
02:26:36,687 --> 02:26:41,271
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be quite possible that it's one of those special editions like the .59.

2037
02:26:42,652 --> 02:26:45,114
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very true, like the .59 live mix and stuff?

2038
02:26:45,134 --> 02:26:48,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not the live one, but the really gothy sounding one.

2039
02:26:48,597 --> 02:26:54,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a DWI I'm making to like the second remix or whatever of .59.

2040
02:26:54,262 --> 02:27:00,107
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like half done, and it actually has a backbeat to it instead of like how .59 originally was.

2041
02:27:00,567 --> 02:27:03,029
[SPEAKER_02]: The original one had a beat to it.

2042
02:27:03,310 --> 02:27:05,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I can't explain it.

2043
02:27:05,571 --> 02:27:07,833
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems more, it's a lot more fulfilling.

2044
02:27:07,853 --> 02:27:12,077
[SPEAKER_02]: You hear it better the more that you play it in 2DX.

2045
02:27:12,157 --> 02:27:20,985
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing about that remix that you're doing that, it's like the piano, it makes sense at first, but then it just goes into a different song after that.

2046
02:27:23,906 --> 02:27:25,229
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you guys want to know who won the cage match?

2047
02:27:25,930 --> 02:27:26,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2048
02:27:26,411 --> 02:27:31,600
[SPEAKER_04]: The cage match winner was... And I was surprised because Kylie did manage to get at least one vote.

2049
02:27:34,064 --> 02:27:35,327
[SPEAKER_04]: So not everybody sucks.

2050
02:27:35,968 --> 02:27:36,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2051
02:27:40,250 --> 02:27:45,312
[SPEAKER_04]: But the winner was Sasha by quite a little bit of a landslide, ladies and gentlemen.

2052
02:27:45,892 --> 02:27:49,694
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Sasha takes it and is the winner of the Cage Match.

2053
02:27:49,714 --> 02:27:51,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to think of something next week.

2054
02:27:52,615 --> 02:27:56,956
[SPEAKER_02]: That means what I was talking about in here is going to get played next week.

2055
02:27:59,117 --> 02:27:59,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2056
02:28:01,358 --> 02:28:05,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, at least Loki can't bring in one of his remixes and win it for sure because, you know, it's Loki.

2057
02:28:06,773 --> 02:28:07,494
[SPEAKER_02]: No, never mind.

2058
02:28:07,934 --> 02:28:08,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

2059
02:28:08,955 --> 02:28:09,715
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't bring it next week.

2060
02:28:09,735 --> 02:28:10,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll bring something really good next week.

2061
02:28:10,916 --> 02:28:14,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm going to fuck it up next week, too, and bring something really psycho.

2062
02:28:14,559 --> 02:28:14,759
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2063
02:28:16,640 --> 02:28:18,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we'll talk later.

2064
02:28:18,401 --> 02:28:19,562
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll come up with a plan.

2065
02:28:20,023 --> 02:28:22,905
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm thinking I'll get that chick from American Idol.

2066
02:28:22,925 --> 02:28:25,166
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be my cage mat fix.

2067
02:28:25,427 --> 02:28:27,928
[SPEAKER_04]: The children of the world.

2068
02:28:27,948 --> 02:28:30,710
[SPEAKER_02]: The children, what about the children?

2069
02:28:30,750 --> 02:28:32,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my Ayudo remixes.

2070
02:28:33,052 --> 02:28:33,933
[SPEAKER_02]: My Ayudo CDs.

2071
02:28:35,134 --> 02:28:35,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-huh.

2072
02:28:37,496 --> 02:28:39,377
[SPEAKER_04]: The chick from Sacramento on American Idol is a bitch.

2073
02:28:39,577 --> 02:28:42,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, not that I know her or anything, she's just a bitch on the show.

2074
02:28:43,259 --> 02:28:45,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, okay, we're gonna do Ask Orange Lounge now, you guys ready?

2075
02:28:47,927 --> 02:28:51,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, come on.

2076
02:28:54,071 --> 02:28:54,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2077
02:28:54,731 --> 02:28:55,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask Orange Lounge.

2078
02:28:55,311 --> 02:28:55,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

2079
02:28:56,372 --> 02:29:00,574
[SPEAKER_04]: For those that don't know Ask Orange Lounge, this is your opportunity to ask us anything you've ever wanted to ask.

2080
02:29:00,974 --> 02:29:06,077
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're sick that we don't talk about Bomani enough on this show, ask us Bomani-related questions.

2081
02:29:06,097 --> 02:29:06,898
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd be happy to answer.

2082
02:29:07,378 --> 02:29:09,259
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to know something about Loki's sex life?

2083
02:29:09,879 --> 02:29:10,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask it.

2084
02:29:10,300 --> 02:29:11,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe he'll answer it.

2085
02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:13,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe he'll come up with a vicious lie.

2086
02:29:13,662 --> 02:29:14,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

2087
02:29:15,530 --> 02:29:18,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask it and we'll answer it.

2088
02:29:20,711 --> 02:29:22,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

2089
02:29:23,192 --> 02:29:27,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Lab has the first question because I made him hold it over until this segment because this was kind of the inspiration.

2090
02:29:27,873 --> 02:29:29,013
[SPEAKER_04]: We always do Ask Orange Lounge tonight.

2091
02:29:29,293 --> 02:29:30,154
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a question for Jamie.

2092
02:29:31,214 --> 02:29:34,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Lab would like to know, whatever happened to the Orange Lounge quiz?

2093
02:29:35,055 --> 02:29:36,635
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do a live journal quiz.

2094
02:29:36,655 --> 02:29:39,896
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how live journal quizzes all the... Okay, this is what happened.

2095
02:29:39,916 --> 02:29:40,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie got a job.

2096
02:29:42,797 --> 02:29:43,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

2097
02:29:43,557 --> 02:29:44,137
[SPEAKER_02]: End of story.

2098
02:29:45,305 --> 02:29:46,306
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2099
02:30:07,143 --> 02:30:12,645
[SPEAKER_04]: So come to the chatroom, come to the chatroom Tuesday night, and we'll let you know what block and zone we're playing in.

2100
02:30:12,685 --> 02:30:13,686
[SPEAKER_04]: This is PSO GameCube.

2101
02:30:13,706 --> 02:30:18,028
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, remember that Jamie played her game all at once, and she actually needs to get past level 1.

2102
02:30:18,108 --> 02:30:20,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think what we're going to do, this is the other stipulation.

2103
02:30:20,769 --> 02:30:22,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Tuesday night, if you come, new character.

2104
02:30:22,790 --> 02:30:25,011
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all going to start with new characters for Tuesday night.

2105
02:30:25,131 --> 02:30:29,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine, even though I made her when I first got the game, I've only played it once, so I'll leave her as she is.

2106
02:30:29,653 --> 02:30:30,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's fine.

2107
02:30:30,753 --> 02:30:33,434
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's got to be low level, so we all start at the same and progress at the same.

2108
02:30:33,534 --> 02:30:34,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing higher than level 1.

2109
02:30:35,215 --> 02:30:37,996
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're into PSO, GameCube, come on the chatroom Tuesday night.

2110
02:30:38,016 --> 02:30:38,876
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll let you know where we're at.

2111
02:30:38,957 --> 02:30:39,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2112
02:30:39,877 --> 02:30:41,778
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you guys talking about back here?

2113
02:30:42,278 --> 02:30:43,618
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never played PSO.

2114
02:30:43,658 --> 02:30:44,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what that is.

2115
02:30:44,418 --> 02:30:44,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Sucks to be you.

2116
02:30:44,899 --> 02:30:46,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantasy Star Online.

2117
02:30:48,320 --> 02:30:50,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a GameCube and a broadband adapter.

2118
02:30:50,081 --> 02:30:51,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll show it to you sometime.

2119
02:30:51,441 --> 02:30:51,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2120
02:30:52,821 --> 02:30:53,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I might play my game tonight.

2121
02:30:54,562 --> 02:30:54,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

2122
02:30:55,082 --> 02:30:56,703
[SPEAKER_02]: How about our stipulation be no one over level 3?

2123
02:30:57,463 --> 02:30:58,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's fine.

2124
02:30:59,244 --> 02:30:59,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

2125
02:31:01,084 --> 02:31:02,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Jay Kinetic wants to know...

2126
02:31:03,163 --> 02:31:04,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I kill the intern on a show?

2127
02:31:07,665 --> 02:31:08,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I kill you?

2128
02:31:10,507 --> 02:31:11,527
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you don't want to fight with Jahi.

2129
02:31:12,487 --> 02:31:13,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Jahi, kick your ass.

2130
02:31:14,769 --> 02:31:15,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2131
02:31:15,529 --> 02:31:17,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's everyone's favorite superhero?

2132
02:31:19,111 --> 02:31:22,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Juman!

2133
02:31:22,972 --> 02:31:23,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave says Juman.

2134
02:31:25,113 --> 02:31:25,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Bombay.

2135
02:31:25,834 --> 02:31:29,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna have to go with Dave and say Juman.

2136
02:31:29,596 --> 02:31:30,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Juman for Bombay, too.

2137
02:31:31,877 --> 02:31:32,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

2138
02:31:33,402 --> 02:31:38,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not fucking seeing Juman, ass!

2139
02:31:40,628 --> 02:31:45,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, one of my friends is like... Fine, if you're going to say Juman, I'm going to say Nazi boy.

2140
02:31:47,834 --> 02:31:48,995
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my arch rival!

2141
02:31:49,395 --> 02:31:50,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki!

2142
02:31:50,476 --> 02:31:51,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesus!

2143
02:31:52,798 --> 02:31:55,439
[SPEAKER_09]: We are going to have to tape his mouth shut.

2144
02:31:55,679 --> 02:32:03,564
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like Nazi Boy, the protector of the... Loki is worse than t-shirthell.com tonight.

2145
02:32:03,945 --> 02:32:06,186
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about fucking Bluntman.

2146
02:32:06,306 --> 02:32:08,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Bluntman, much better.

2147
02:32:09,348 --> 02:32:10,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Much better, Bluntman, thank you.

2148
02:32:11,987 --> 02:32:16,331
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to apologize for my killing you comment, but I would say Orgasmo.

2149
02:32:16,991 --> 02:32:17,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Orgasmo!

2150
02:32:18,472 --> 02:32:18,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

2151
02:32:19,413 --> 02:32:20,334
[SPEAKER_04]: You want me to go or you want to go?

2152
02:32:20,374 --> 02:32:20,754
[SPEAKER_02]: My turn.

2153
02:32:20,914 --> 02:32:21,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Jamie.

2154
02:32:22,455 --> 02:32:23,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Handyman and the Tiny Avenger.

2155
02:32:24,317 --> 02:32:26,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Handyman and the Tiny Avenger.

2156
02:32:27,499 --> 02:32:28,500
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to talk about Ju-Man for a second?

2157
02:32:29,062 --> 02:32:34,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, one of my friends, like, cause a couple people at school, like, joke about me being Jewish whenever I say something.

2158
02:32:34,664 --> 02:32:38,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I would make a comment and they're like, oh, is that a Jewish type thing?

2159
02:32:38,606 --> 02:32:40,887
[SPEAKER_09]: And so he's got, he's one of my friends who can draw.

2160
02:32:41,227 --> 02:32:53,693
[SPEAKER_09]: He's making this comic called Jew Man about, like, me and, like, I get too close to, like, some bush that lights on fire and something and I gain, like, magical Jew powers with my mega menorah and my dreidel of power and stuff.

2161
02:32:54,133 --> 02:32:55,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally sounds like Paul.

2162
02:32:55,654 --> 02:32:57,795
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you have like super spitting power?

2163
02:32:58,075 --> 02:32:59,415
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you have spitting action?

2164
02:32:59,775 --> 02:33:00,336
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2165
02:33:01,236 --> 02:33:02,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Paul is dead.

2166
02:33:02,697 --> 02:33:03,297
[SPEAKER_09]: He's gone.

2167
02:33:03,337 --> 02:33:04,958
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Orange Lounge Ask the World.

2168
02:33:05,118 --> 02:33:07,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Your action figure needs kosher scent power.

2169
02:33:09,019 --> 02:33:10,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you too.

2170
02:33:10,640 --> 02:33:14,702
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm changing my vote from Jew Man, I'm changing it, to Lightning Day.

2171
02:33:16,642 --> 02:33:17,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2172
02:33:17,563 --> 02:33:20,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone that knows me, this should be a duh.

2173
02:33:20,264 --> 02:33:22,425
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite superhero is Catwoman, of course.

2174
02:33:25,788 --> 02:33:26,429
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a hero to some.

2175
02:33:26,449 --> 02:33:26,889
[SPEAKER_00]: She's good now.

2176
02:33:26,909 --> 02:33:27,749
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a hero to me.

2177
02:33:28,470 --> 02:33:30,050
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a hero to me and she's going to have her own movie.

2178
02:33:30,891 --> 02:33:33,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Are the interns... More questions from Jahi.

2179
02:33:33,792 --> 02:33:34,592
[SPEAKER_04]: More questions from Jahi.

2180
02:33:34,932 --> 02:33:36,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Are the interns related to Godden?

2181
02:33:37,314 --> 02:33:37,554
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

2182
02:33:38,894 --> 02:33:39,875
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a guy in SoCal.

2183
02:33:39,955 --> 02:33:40,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is that?

2184
02:33:42,796 --> 02:33:43,556
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the big... Okay, well...

2185
02:33:46,739 --> 02:33:51,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Mel told me I should MC a tournament with him, but I'm not related to him.

2186
02:33:52,360 --> 02:33:52,880
[SPEAKER_04]: He seemed cool.

2187
02:33:52,920 --> 02:33:57,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really talk to him at all, because I was kind of introverted and clicky at CyberBeat, unfortunately, because I'm a bitch.

2188
02:33:57,641 --> 02:34:00,902
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really an intern, by the way.

2189
02:34:01,042 --> 02:34:03,783
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kind of sitting in, I guess.

2190
02:34:04,603 --> 02:34:05,103
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a guest.

2191
02:34:05,403 --> 02:34:06,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Monica Lewinsky was an intern.

2192
02:34:06,583 --> 02:34:07,824
[SPEAKER_02]: That means we make him go do stuff.

2193
02:34:11,747 --> 02:34:12,087
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2194
02:34:13,107 --> 02:34:13,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Next question.

2195
02:34:14,408 --> 02:34:16,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Orange Lounge for the children?

2196
02:34:17,889 --> 02:34:22,490
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, but I think... Children of the liking to listen to crazy monkey sex?

2197
02:34:22,650 --> 02:34:23,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

2198
02:34:23,790 --> 02:34:24,850
[SPEAKER_02]: JB will agree with me.

2199
02:34:25,050 --> 02:34:28,691
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we actually are the founders of the Cup of Child Foundation.

2200
02:34:29,331 --> 02:34:31,452
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, new flavors of ramen, Cup of Child.

2201
02:34:31,472 --> 02:34:33,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Answer that question.

2202
02:34:33,993 --> 02:34:36,013
[SPEAKER_02]: There's skanky RVGL flavor.

2203
02:34:36,973 --> 02:34:39,274
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, you know, spicy Scandia flavor.

2204
02:34:40,086 --> 02:34:43,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's, you know, there's CCL ass flavor.

2205
02:34:43,509 --> 02:34:44,189
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, remember that?

2206
02:34:44,209 --> 02:34:46,531
[SPEAKER_22]: No, that's drugs and alcohol flavor.

2207
02:34:46,611 --> 02:34:49,594
[SPEAKER_22]: And then Crud Under the Machine, uh, Crest-V flavor.

2208
02:34:55,599 --> 02:34:57,620
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, Orange Lounge is non-existent flavor.

2209
02:34:58,061 --> 02:35:00,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge is not for the children, but they listen to it anyway.

2210
02:35:01,964 --> 02:35:03,685
[SPEAKER_22]: We think... It's like porn.

2211
02:35:04,746 --> 02:35:05,767
[SPEAKER_22]: We think that children are lazy.

2212
02:35:05,787 --> 02:35:06,828
[SPEAKER_08]: I could say anything to porn.

2213
02:35:09,198 --> 02:35:16,463
[SPEAKER_10]: I love how everyone thinks I'm like a racist, porn-addicted, crazy psychopath, when I'm like totally opposite in person.

2214
02:35:16,723 --> 02:35:17,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2215
02:35:17,463 --> 02:35:17,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Next question.

2216
02:35:18,224 --> 02:35:18,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2217
02:35:18,964 --> 02:35:20,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Next question is for Loki.

2218
02:35:20,525 --> 02:35:21,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Next question is for Loki.

2219
02:35:21,706 --> 02:35:24,408
[SPEAKER_02]: And frosted with sugar and fortified with vitamins.

2220
02:35:24,668 --> 02:35:25,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Next question is for Loki.

2221
02:35:25,668 --> 02:35:26,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

2222
02:35:26,549 --> 02:35:27,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Does Loki have a sex life?

2223
02:35:28,550 --> 02:35:29,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn right I do!

2224
02:35:30,511 --> 02:35:39,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh man, dude, seriously, you think I sound horny on air, imagine my girlfriend, she's about ten times as horny as I am, so, it's just like, holy crap.

2225
02:35:43,117 --> 02:35:46,039
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a good, it's a, it's damn good.

2226
02:35:47,580 --> 02:35:49,001
[SPEAKER_02]: For your birthday, we'll get you vitamins.

2227
02:35:49,402 --> 02:35:51,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2228
02:35:51,523 --> 02:35:55,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, I do need vitamins because I don't eat well at all.

2229
02:35:55,126 --> 02:35:58,169
[SPEAKER_10]: I eat like one meal a day and it's normally junk food and I'm tired.

2230
02:36:00,471 --> 02:36:01,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, but that's alright.

2231
02:36:02,052 --> 02:36:06,295
[SPEAKER_04]: SkylineDC505, Dave, do I still get prawn for my birthday?

2232
02:36:07,416 --> 02:36:10,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that depends on if I get my prawn from Loki.

2233
02:36:10,359 --> 02:36:10,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2234
02:36:12,782 --> 02:36:13,383
[SPEAKER_10]: I got two mics.

2235
02:36:15,486 --> 02:36:18,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, I can get you both prawns, so that's no problem.

2236
02:36:20,313 --> 02:36:21,375
Where's my man prawn?

2237
02:36:21,635 --> 02:36:21,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

2238
02:36:21,976 --> 02:36:22,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying!

2239
02:36:22,436 --> 02:36:23,338
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not coming!

2240
02:36:24,079 --> 02:36:24,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny wants prawns.

2241
02:36:24,900 --> 02:36:26,603
[SPEAKER_02]: The men aren't coming in the prawn?

2242
02:36:28,476 --> 02:36:28,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

2243
02:36:29,377 --> 02:36:32,780
[SPEAKER_04]: EOSFVB, he always has some good questions for us, so here they are.

2244
02:36:33,260 --> 02:36:42,689
[SPEAKER_04]: First question, who has read, and now I have to do my horrible English again, who has read Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes?

2245
02:36:43,870 --> 02:36:44,511
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I haven't.

2246
02:36:45,451 --> 02:36:46,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't either.

2247
02:36:46,392 --> 02:36:47,693
[SPEAKER_20]: But I'm interested in reading it.

2248
02:36:48,154 --> 02:36:48,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet it's porn.

2249
02:36:49,155 --> 02:36:49,655
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not.

2250
02:36:50,076 --> 02:36:51,337
[SPEAKER_04]: It's EOSFVB, come on.

2251
02:36:52,017 --> 02:36:53,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Second question is for Dave.

2252
02:36:53,999 --> 02:36:54,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Second question is for Dave.

2253
02:36:56,837 --> 02:36:57,878
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to ask it, Jamie?

2254
02:36:57,998 --> 02:36:58,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm leaning back.

2255
02:36:58,678 --> 02:36:59,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I ain't reading it from here.

2256
02:36:59,739 --> 02:37:00,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.

2257
02:37:00,959 --> 02:37:02,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Segway's for Dave.

2258
02:37:02,420 --> 02:37:05,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you ever beat that ancient boy game, amateur?

2259
02:37:06,783 --> 02:37:07,944
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I never actually beat it.

2260
02:37:08,004 --> 02:37:09,805
[SPEAKER_09]: I never played it after that one day.

2261
02:37:10,205 --> 02:37:13,207
[SPEAKER_09]: I just played it and I got to one bone left with two cracks in it.

2262
02:37:14,127 --> 02:37:15,288
[SPEAKER_22]: A bone and some crack.

2263
02:37:15,448 --> 02:37:16,348
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was a bone.

2264
02:37:17,709 --> 02:37:19,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's what... No, no, you were throwing a bone.

2265
02:37:19,570 --> 02:37:21,932
[SPEAKER_09]: First you take crack, then you take bone.

2266
02:37:22,032 --> 02:37:23,793
[SPEAKER_22]: Insert bone into crack.

2267
02:37:24,784 --> 02:37:29,525
[SPEAKER_22]: Repeat as often as necessary until you obtain desired results.

2268
02:37:30,686 --> 02:37:31,546
[SPEAKER_22]: The end.

2269
02:37:31,686 --> 02:37:34,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Next question, and it's Bomani-related, and it's an excellent question.

2270
02:37:35,467 --> 02:37:40,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Satome Ranma wants to know, I ask Orange Lounge this, why is it so hard to find Poppin' Music mp3s?

2271
02:37:40,688 --> 02:37:44,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, Not A House, Pyramid, MeloBunk, or TraumaBunk anywhere, dammit.

2272
02:37:45,430 --> 02:37:46,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Poppin' Music mp3s, hard to find.

2273
02:37:47,355 --> 02:37:53,458
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, Poppin' Music is really cool, but it does have a limited fanbase, honestly.

2274
02:37:53,658 --> 02:37:54,659
[SPEAKER_10]: You want Poppin' Music MP3s?

2275
02:37:54,679 --> 02:37:55,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Go to Bomayi Style.

2276
02:37:56,660 --> 02:37:57,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Serious.

2277
02:37:57,440 --> 02:37:59,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Tons of MP3s for Poppin' Music stuff there.

2278
02:37:59,542 --> 02:38:02,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Or, if you can't find them, look for Feeling Pomu.

2279
02:38:02,623 --> 02:38:03,384
[SPEAKER_10]: That's their sim.

2280
02:38:04,104 --> 02:38:07,226
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sure if you find sim files for that, you'll probably find the MP3s as well.

2281
02:38:08,847 --> 02:38:12,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, you know how much of a pain in the ass it is to find sim files for that?

2282
02:38:12,609 --> 02:38:12,989
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it.

2283
02:38:13,049 --> 02:38:14,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I found all but two.

2284
02:38:14,730 --> 02:38:15,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Anywhere.

2285
02:38:15,290 --> 02:38:16,831
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why you use the Japanese internet.

2286
02:38:17,245 --> 02:38:29,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to actually suggest, if you're looking for Poppin' Music MP3s, go download SimFiles, because people make SimFiles to all these other Bomani Game MP3s, and Poppin' Music happens to be made into files a lot.

2287
02:38:30,134 --> 02:38:31,195
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, there's WinMex.

2288
02:38:32,116 --> 02:38:32,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

2289
02:38:34,958 --> 02:38:40,442
[SPEAKER_02]: And eBay, they have three of the Poppin' Music soundtracks on eBay right now for about five bucks a piece.

2290
02:38:41,747 --> 02:38:46,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Satomi Ranma also wants to know, as a follow-up question, have you guys seen the original Japanese The Ring?

2291
02:38:47,109 --> 02:38:47,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Scary shit.

2292
02:38:48,209 --> 02:38:48,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Ringu.

2293
02:38:48,669 --> 02:38:50,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been wanting to because I want to see it before I see the U.S.

2294
02:38:51,070 --> 02:38:51,130
[SPEAKER_02]: one.

2295
02:38:51,150 --> 02:38:51,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Guess what?

2296
02:38:51,730 --> 02:38:53,290
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually coming out at the same time in the U.S.

2297
02:38:53,450 --> 02:38:53,550
[SPEAKER_10]: one.

2298
02:38:54,031 --> 02:38:55,071
[SPEAKER_10]: They're releasing it on DUD.

2299
02:38:55,151 --> 02:38:55,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Ringu.

2300
02:38:56,711 --> 02:38:57,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Ringu.

2301
02:38:58,092 --> 02:38:58,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Ringu.

2302
02:38:58,572 --> 02:39:00,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so it's coming out at the same time in the U.S.

2303
02:39:00,613 --> 02:39:01,833
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be subtitled, I believe.

2304
02:39:03,543 --> 02:39:06,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Billy, we were just talking about this earlier today.

2305
02:39:06,246 --> 02:39:07,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Billy's seen it and he says it's very good.

2306
02:39:07,768 --> 02:39:09,990
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess it's a three-part series there.

2307
02:39:11,111 --> 02:39:12,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I have a question for our chat room.

2308
02:39:13,173 --> 02:39:13,534
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

2309
02:39:14,174 --> 02:39:17,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember hardly anything about this movie, but I've been trying to find it.

2310
02:39:18,659 --> 02:39:21,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been putting in all these clues trying to find this one movie.

2311
02:39:21,241 --> 02:39:23,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if anyone's ever heard of it or knows what this is.

2312
02:39:24,004 --> 02:39:25,766
[SPEAKER_02]: It had to have come out in the early 80s or late 70s.

2313
02:39:27,067 --> 02:39:32,148
[SPEAKER_02]: It was this movie about these people who move into this house that's possessed by three Japanese spirits.

2314
02:39:32,909 --> 02:39:36,010
[SPEAKER_02]: And these people, back then, each killed themselves.

2315
02:39:36,050 --> 02:39:40,531
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the movie, the people end up recreating the fight that led to the three there who killed themselves.

2316
02:39:41,051 --> 02:39:42,191
[SPEAKER_02]: And they kill themselves the same way.

2317
02:39:44,352 --> 02:39:47,313
[SPEAKER_02]: This was an old movie, and I've been trying to find the name of this movie.

2318
02:39:48,753 --> 02:39:49,833
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not a Brady Bunch movie.

2319
02:39:50,193 --> 02:39:50,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

2320
02:39:53,812 --> 02:39:55,776
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's like these, you know, Uber.

2321
02:39:56,077 --> 02:39:57,760
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's like these Uber cracker people, too.

2322
02:39:59,503 --> 02:40:00,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like almost in a beach house.

2323
02:40:01,026 --> 02:40:03,231
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a house with these stairs leading up and it's by the water.

2324
02:40:04,553 --> 02:40:04,894
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not.

2325
02:40:04,914 --> 02:40:05,575
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't get rid of it.

2326
02:40:06,224 --> 02:40:12,528
[SPEAKER_02]: But for anyone who happens to know the name of this movie or anything, please let me know, because I've been trying to find this for, like, years.

2327
02:40:12,908 --> 02:40:16,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we still got a ton of questions to go through, so let's move right along here.

2328
02:40:16,790 --> 02:40:22,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, John Fields wants to know, favorite non-standard DDR mix, i.e.

2329
02:40:22,573 --> 02:40:23,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Euro, Disney?

2330
02:40:24,755 --> 02:40:25,355
[SPEAKER_20]: Ohasta!

2331
02:40:27,313 --> 02:40:28,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Ohasta says Jamie.

2332
02:40:28,493 --> 02:40:28,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Bombay?

2333
02:40:29,614 --> 02:40:31,034
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say Disney.

2334
02:40:31,154 --> 02:40:35,656
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to go play in Orange County, and it's like the best mix I've ever played.

2335
02:40:36,957 --> 02:40:37,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Euromix 2.

2336
02:40:39,458 --> 02:40:43,019
[SPEAKER_06]: That's tough, but I'd probably say Ohasta, only because it has Ohaska on it.

2337
02:40:46,865 --> 02:40:47,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Say your answer too.

2338
02:40:48,866 --> 02:40:50,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, you say your answer too.

2339
02:40:50,867 --> 02:40:51,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I say pump it up.

2340
02:40:55,268 --> 02:40:56,569
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not DDR.

2341
02:40:59,130 --> 02:41:01,611
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Korean DDR, same damn thing.

2342
02:41:01,731 --> 02:41:02,631
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it's different.

2343
02:41:03,752 --> 02:41:04,452
[SPEAKER_20]: Next question.

2344
02:41:04,732 --> 02:41:05,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, next question.

2345
02:41:07,033 --> 02:41:11,277
[SPEAKER_04]: SnubDisnoid says, First off, what's the easiest Oni?

2346
02:41:11,778 --> 02:41:17,123
[SPEAKER_04]: I've gotten halfway into a few Onis and even got to Stoic on Road of Tack once, but I haven't passed anything.

2347
02:41:17,663 --> 02:41:18,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Easiest Oni?

2348
02:41:19,153 --> 02:41:23,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I'd barely ever play them, I would have to say Naoki Standard.

2349
02:41:23,575 --> 02:41:30,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, are you talking about Extreme, or... Because on Max 2, I'm sure that you passed some of them, like Soul 6 and shit.

2350
02:41:31,878 --> 02:41:34,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Soul 6 is easy, Naoki Standard was easy for me on Devils.

2351
02:41:34,679 --> 02:41:38,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Naoki Standard, and the first one, whatever, yeah, Nearly 130.

2352
02:41:39,361 --> 02:41:46,424
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you're talking about Extreme, which I think that you are, then, yeah, the Dance Mania and the new Naoki thing.

2353
02:41:48,803 --> 02:41:50,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't that dance menu one have Rhythm of Police in it though?

2354
02:41:53,168 --> 02:41:53,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Thought it did.

2355
02:41:58,753 --> 02:42:01,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Pop4 is an easy one, but that's a non-stop, yeah.

2356
02:42:02,355 --> 02:42:02,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2357
02:42:03,995 --> 02:42:09,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Your second question we'll have to answer offline because we banned that topic from discussion on this show.

2358
02:42:10,138 --> 02:42:12,999
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we'll answer your question offline gladly for you, though.

2359
02:42:13,379 --> 02:42:14,679
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we'll get to that later.

2360
02:42:15,820 --> 02:42:16,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2361
02:42:17,080 --> 02:42:20,922
[SPEAKER_04]: JapanMan wants to know, Dave, how long is your shaft?

2362
02:42:22,523 --> 02:42:23,323
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a few months ago.

2363
02:42:27,529 --> 02:42:28,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Snip the tip, baby.

2364
02:42:28,950 --> 02:42:33,293
[SPEAKER_09]: No, um, I don't, I'm not going to answer that.

2365
02:42:33,573 --> 02:42:37,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, yeah, more than you can handle.

2366
02:42:41,598 --> 02:42:41,918
Never.

2367
02:42:43,119 --> 02:42:45,100
[SPEAKER_09]: It's above average, and that's all I'm saying.

2368
02:42:45,140 --> 02:42:45,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, above average.

2369
02:42:46,441 --> 02:42:46,881
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.

2370
02:42:48,122 --> 02:42:50,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you, no, don't do that, please.

2371
02:42:50,444 --> 02:42:52,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you comparable with Ron Jeremy?

2372
02:42:53,185 --> 02:42:54,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Comparable with Ron Jeremy?

2373
02:42:54,666 --> 02:42:55,807
[SPEAKER_22]: I have never seen it.

2374
02:42:56,829 --> 02:42:57,870
[SPEAKER_22]: He's 9 and 3 quarters.

2375
02:42:58,530 --> 02:42:59,351
[SPEAKER_22]: He's 9 and 3 quarters.

2376
02:42:59,972 --> 02:43:01,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, okay.

2377
02:43:02,714 --> 02:43:03,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

2378
02:43:04,215 --> 02:43:08,599
[SPEAKER_04]: DAF Square wants to know, when is Sky's Voice the game coming out?

2379
02:43:11,187 --> 02:43:18,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Some... We'll get an MP3... I need some MP3 sent to me and I can make some... We'll see.

2380
02:43:19,429 --> 02:43:19,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2381
02:43:20,149 --> 02:43:20,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

2382
02:43:22,010 --> 02:43:25,791
[SPEAKER_04]: We have that one that Stressa made, and I don't know if Angel helped him with that or not.

2383
02:43:26,471 --> 02:43:28,671
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think it was all Stressa, because I know Stressa did the lyrics.

2384
02:43:29,992 --> 02:43:34,953
[SPEAKER_04]: And he made this sim file of a parody that I did during a fuck-off show to Bumblebee.

2385
02:43:35,353 --> 02:43:36,614
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's really embarrassing.

2386
02:43:36,634 --> 02:43:37,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe... I played it on the show last week.

2387
02:43:37,714 --> 02:43:41,516
[SPEAKER_04]: The damn thing is actually being pretty widely distributed right now, which is pretty scary to me.

2388
02:43:41,536 --> 02:43:42,596
[SPEAKER_04]: I played it on the show last week.

2389
02:43:43,136 --> 02:43:44,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know, and you played it on the show.

2390
02:43:44,397 --> 02:43:45,898
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be the week before.

2391
02:43:46,138 --> 02:43:48,279
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to do it from show and just sing.

2392
02:43:48,919 --> 02:43:52,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Sing to the music, like, you know, sing lyrics to Afronova.

2393
02:43:54,361 --> 02:43:55,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I will promise you guys...

2394
02:43:56,642 --> 02:44:06,867
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be another MP3 of me singing on Orange Lounge Radio sometime in the next week.

2395
02:44:07,108 --> 02:44:08,628
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what everyone missed, though?

2396
02:44:09,068 --> 02:44:10,109
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a few weeks ago.

2397
02:44:11,750 --> 02:44:13,551
[SPEAKER_02]: She's been on the show a couple times, Iguana Girl.

2398
02:44:13,751 --> 02:44:20,254
[SPEAKER_02]: We were at Scandia doing our own version of Katimu to V. What song?

2399
02:44:20,274 --> 02:44:21,895
[SPEAKER_02]: We were doing our own Katimu version of V.

2400
02:44:23,217 --> 02:44:24,558
[SPEAKER_22]: and other songs.

2401
02:44:25,298 --> 02:44:27,839
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't remember who was playing, but we were back there singing along with it.

2402
02:44:27,859 --> 02:44:28,339
[SPEAKER_22]: It was great.

2403
02:44:30,640 --> 02:44:36,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I promised the masses an announcer pack quite some time ago, so Loki, you've got to help me out with that, making an announcer pack.

2404
02:44:36,322 --> 02:44:36,762
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do that.

2405
02:44:36,882 --> 02:44:37,402
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll work on it.

2406
02:44:38,840 --> 02:44:42,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Lab wants to know, is there a Boba in your immediate future?

2407
02:44:43,784 --> 02:44:46,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not tonight, but maybe sometime this week.

2408
02:44:47,267 --> 02:44:49,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because I'm really, personally, I'm really tired.

2409
02:44:49,549 --> 02:44:51,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I was up until 5am last night.

2410
02:44:51,330 --> 02:44:52,171
[SPEAKER_20]: And whose fault is that?

2411
02:44:53,112 --> 02:44:56,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine, but that means I ain't going to Boba tonight, but maybe sometime this week.

2412
02:44:56,575 --> 02:44:57,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I do kind of crave it.

2413
02:44:57,976 --> 02:44:59,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had Boba at all this week.

2414
02:44:59,737 --> 02:45:00,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what I mean, I haven't had Boba in a while.

2415
02:45:02,840 --> 02:45:03,520
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we need to go.

2416
02:45:03,540 --> 02:45:04,461
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to take Loki then.

2417
02:45:05,742 --> 02:45:07,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, we need to go apartment hunting and then look for Boba.

2418
02:45:08,633 --> 02:45:10,313
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me know when you're going to vote, because I'm going to vote.

2419
02:45:10,333 --> 02:45:10,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2420
02:45:11,234 --> 02:45:15,575
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya wants to know, how do I let someone know I'm interested, if you know what I mean?

2421
02:45:16,055 --> 02:45:16,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent question.

2422
02:45:17,315 --> 02:45:18,115
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty serious one.

2423
02:45:18,395 --> 02:45:21,076
[SPEAKER_02]: You go up to them and go, you know what, I'm interested in you.

2424
02:45:21,196 --> 02:45:21,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like to date?

2425
02:45:22,756 --> 02:45:23,317
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you say.

2426
02:45:24,397 --> 02:45:27,077
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, I mean, I'm a shy person too, honestly.

2427
02:45:27,317 --> 02:45:30,478
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's so hard for me to just go up to somebody and ask that.

2428
02:45:30,518 --> 02:45:31,759
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really bold.

2429
02:45:32,259 --> 02:45:35,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, okay, I'm the worst at doing that type of shit ever.

2430
02:45:35,379 --> 02:45:37,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I like go up and be like, you're hot.

2431
02:45:39,749 --> 02:45:41,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, here's what you really have to do.

2432
02:45:42,150 --> 02:45:44,671
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to keep cereal in your pocket to feed them.

2433
02:45:45,352 --> 02:45:45,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, Ryan?

2434
02:45:46,132 --> 02:45:47,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Back me up on that.

2435
02:45:47,293 --> 02:45:47,993
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta keep cereal.

2436
02:45:48,013 --> 02:45:49,754
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to crunch on the can.

2437
02:45:50,914 --> 02:45:57,037
[SPEAKER_02]: This is... As the resident woman... Okay, first of all... I'll be right back.

2438
02:45:57,317 --> 02:45:57,918
[SPEAKER_10]: I gotta take a piss.

2439
02:45:59,138 --> 02:46:01,579
[SPEAKER_02]: As the resident woman... Is that what you said?

2440
02:46:01,859 --> 02:46:02,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Let Jamie speak.

2441
02:46:02,820 --> 02:46:03,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Let Jamie speak.

2442
02:46:04,140 --> 02:46:07,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is absolute bullshit to drop hints that you like somebody.

2443
02:46:08,644 --> 02:46:13,950
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because, I mean, it's like, guys start acting really weird when they're interested in you.

2444
02:46:16,032 --> 02:46:17,734
[SPEAKER_02]: And you think that they have a disease.

2445
02:46:18,114 --> 02:46:20,076
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they start creeping you out and you don't want to be around them.

2446
02:46:20,817 --> 02:46:21,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

2447
02:46:21,598 --> 02:46:23,941
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like somebody, fucking tell them.

2448
02:46:24,713 --> 02:46:28,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Get them by themselves and go, you know what, do you want to hang out?

2449
02:46:28,595 --> 02:46:29,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you don't even have to say it right away.

2450
02:46:30,096 --> 02:46:34,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Say, you know what, would you like to go to a movie or go anywhere?

2451
02:46:34,998 --> 02:46:38,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's a little more along the lines of, I wouldn't say you just come out and say, I like you.

2452
02:46:39,100 --> 02:46:41,601
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, you know, find out, talk to the person.

2453
02:46:41,621 --> 02:46:42,722
[SPEAKER_04]: People are going to talk to you.

2454
02:46:42,822 --> 02:46:43,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how you doing?

2455
02:46:43,982 --> 02:46:47,484
[SPEAKER_04]: And you talk and you find out what you have in common and then you go out and do that common thing.

2456
02:46:47,944 --> 02:46:53,307
[SPEAKER_02]: But see, me as, and maybe I'm different among women because I don't like bullshit.

2457
02:46:54,258 --> 02:46:57,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, if you want to go out with me, ask me if you want to go out with me.

2458
02:46:58,601 --> 02:47:00,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, can I go out with you?

2459
02:47:00,562 --> 02:47:00,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

2460
02:47:01,762 --> 02:47:06,465
[SPEAKER_02]: No, see... I mean, I've gone out and said, hey, I think you're cool, I want to go out with you.

2461
02:47:07,025 --> 02:47:08,046
[SPEAKER_09]: No, see, I'm too honest.

2462
02:47:08,126 --> 02:47:13,249
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, you're hot, your face could use a little work, but you're still pretty hot, so you want to go out?

2463
02:47:13,589 --> 02:47:14,830
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you'll be like, fuck you!

2464
02:47:17,316 --> 02:47:19,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Jay Kinetic sums it up very nicely here.

2465
02:47:20,217 --> 02:47:25,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, try to get her to laugh at a joke, talk about a common topic, and then casually invite her out to have lunch sometime.

2466
02:47:25,480 --> 02:47:26,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Two simple things.

2467
02:47:26,700 --> 02:47:31,222
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, don't have any of your friends do it for you.

2468
02:47:31,662 --> 02:47:32,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't write a letter.

2469
02:47:33,483 --> 02:47:35,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Just walk up and call them.

2470
02:47:35,604 --> 02:47:35,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember it.

2471
02:47:36,004 --> 02:47:36,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk to them.

2472
02:47:36,725 --> 02:47:38,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember it.

2473
02:47:38,926 --> 02:47:40,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't have your friends there when you ask.

2474
02:47:40,106 --> 02:47:44,368
[SPEAKER_10]: If we've learned anything from Alamor, it's basically to go, I have money.

2475
02:47:46,334 --> 02:48:11,575
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but actually, seriously, what you want to do is you want to definitely go up and tell them because if you waste time by just, like, beating around the bush and stuff, you're not only going to waste time, make yourself more stressed out, and, yeah, that might happen in the meantime, but it's better to, like, you know, instead of waiting forever and then telling her and she saying no to find out, you know, beforehand, you know, say, hey, I like you, hi, I'm not interested, or hi, I'm interested, you know,

2476
02:48:12,316 --> 02:48:13,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever she says.

2477
02:48:13,457 --> 02:48:14,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever she says back.

2478
02:48:14,998 --> 02:48:17,760
[SPEAKER_02]: And never casually make out with somebody you're not interested in.

2479
02:48:18,700 --> 02:48:19,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, Tarma, man, that's fun.

2480
02:48:21,182 --> 02:48:25,225
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because then, like, they might expect that you are interested in them.

2481
02:48:25,265 --> 02:48:25,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.

2482
02:48:25,925 --> 02:48:27,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the greatest pickup line.

2483
02:48:27,386 --> 02:48:29,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe it or not, I have the greatest pickup line for women.

2484
02:48:29,408 --> 02:48:30,849
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, this is it.

2485
02:48:31,249 --> 02:48:35,292
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, no, you go up, you say, hey, I like peanut butter, wanna fuck?

2486
02:48:37,916 --> 02:48:44,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, the best pick-up line that I've heard of is, um, what was it, is like, uh, do you like jogging?

2487
02:48:46,723 --> 02:48:58,573
[SPEAKER_10]: And, well, the thing is, is, is, it's gotten you in the conversation, it's not some awkward, you know, some pick-up line or whatever, and you should probably respond to that, you know, and then you're like, hi, my name is, you know.

2488
02:48:58,613 --> 02:48:59,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, do you like jogging?

2489
02:48:59,394 --> 02:48:59,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, hi.

2490
02:49:01,601 --> 02:49:02,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Did your wife like photography?

2491
02:49:02,862 --> 02:49:03,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, do you like casual sex?

2492
02:49:03,922 --> 02:49:05,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Karen did pictures with Ashton Milling Lee.

2493
02:49:05,783 --> 02:49:07,605
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, no, okay, bye.

2494
02:49:07,625 --> 02:49:09,726
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, hey, do you like casual sex?

2495
02:49:09,806 --> 02:49:09,946
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2496
02:49:10,106 --> 02:49:11,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, do you like casual sex?

2497
02:49:11,987 --> 02:49:12,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2498
02:49:12,587 --> 02:49:13,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, my name's Dave.

2499
02:49:13,748 --> 02:49:15,029
[SPEAKER_09]: I love casual sex.

2500
02:49:15,929 --> 02:49:17,390
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Bin Mani Loveline.

2501
02:49:17,831 --> 02:49:19,912
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that we should get together and have some sometime.

2502
02:49:19,932 --> 02:49:21,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, common interests.

2503
02:49:21,493 --> 02:49:22,773
[SPEAKER_09]: We both like casual sex.

2504
02:49:23,514 --> 02:49:24,414
[SPEAKER_09]: And, yeah, go from there.

2505
02:49:24,995 --> 02:49:30,158
[SPEAKER_02]: And, by the way, never, ever try to hit on somebody when they're working in an arcade.

2506
02:49:31,198 --> 02:49:38,402
[SPEAKER_02]: This one really scary guy, when I was working at Aladdin's Castle, this one really scary guy came up to me and tried to pick me up.

2507
02:49:38,602 --> 02:49:40,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I have a boyfriend.

2508
02:49:41,463 --> 02:49:42,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, that's okay.

2509
02:49:42,744 --> 02:49:44,585
[SPEAKER_02]: After you hang out with me, you won't want to be around him.

2510
02:49:44,865 --> 02:49:48,367
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, sir, just being around you right now makes me very appreciative of my boyfriend.

2511
02:49:48,927 --> 02:49:50,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me ask Neil, because he just walked in the room.

2512
02:49:50,808 --> 02:49:52,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Neil, what's the best way to pick up chicks?

2513
02:49:53,610 --> 02:49:55,451
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, hi, I like peanut butter.

2514
02:49:55,471 --> 02:49:55,931
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck?

2515
02:49:56,091 --> 02:49:56,591
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

2516
02:49:58,733 --> 02:49:59,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice shoes.

2517
02:50:01,021 --> 02:50:02,643
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

2518
02:50:17,922 --> 02:50:21,185
[SPEAKER_06]: The best way to pick up a girl is with your arms and thin with your knees.

2519
02:50:22,566 --> 02:50:23,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, alright.

2520
02:50:23,427 --> 02:50:23,827
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

2521
02:50:24,108 --> 02:50:26,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we got the serious answer out.

2522
02:50:26,570 --> 02:50:31,955
[SPEAKER_02]: The best way I ever hooked up with a guy one time, and actually this is an incredibly nerdy way but I thought it was pretty funny.

2523
02:50:32,555 --> 02:50:39,021
[SPEAKER_02]: We played D&D and our characters hooked up and then we started dating.

2524
02:50:40,543 --> 02:50:41,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

2525
02:50:57,213 --> 02:51:03,379
[SPEAKER_04]: USFVB wants to know, which female targeted cartoons that most would be ashamed to admit they watched are your favorites?

2526
02:51:03,859 --> 02:51:13,628
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance... Oh, uh... Okay, USFVB says, is the movie Jamie talking about called House Translation, which is from 1977, put out by Toho, I think.

2527
02:51:14,969 --> 02:51:15,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know...

2528
02:51:16,360 --> 02:51:19,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the name of it, but I knew that it was late 70s, early 80s.

2529
02:51:20,444 --> 02:51:22,685
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had three people who ended up killing themselves in the end of the movie.

2530
02:51:22,705 --> 02:51:22,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

2531
02:51:22,966 --> 02:51:24,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Look on Internet Movie Database.

2532
02:51:24,127 --> 02:51:24,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Try that.

2533
02:51:24,467 --> 02:51:24,707
[SPEAKER_04]: House.

2534
02:51:24,847 --> 02:51:25,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Save that.

2535
02:51:25,488 --> 02:51:26,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, email that to me.

2536
02:51:26,509 --> 02:51:31,433
[SPEAKER_04]: EOSFVB, if you would be so kind to email that to OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com, we'd love you forever.

2537
02:51:31,653 --> 02:51:31,893
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2538
02:51:32,614 --> 02:51:33,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, but ask for his question.

2539
02:51:33,835 --> 02:51:37,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Which female-targeted cartoons that would most be the same to admit they watch are your favorites?

2540
02:51:37,237 --> 02:51:38,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody said Sailor Moon.

2541
02:51:38,078 --> 02:51:38,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Who said Sailor Moon?

2542
02:51:39,319 --> 02:51:39,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Anita's back.

2543
02:51:39,840 --> 02:51:40,080
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.

2544
02:51:40,220 --> 02:51:40,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I said Sailor Moon.

2545
02:51:41,061 --> 02:51:41,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Sailor Moon.

2546
02:51:41,881 --> 02:51:42,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Sailor Moon.

2547
02:51:42,922 --> 02:51:44,063
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty cool.

2548
02:51:44,783 --> 02:51:45,724
[SPEAKER_04]: A female-oriented cartoon.

2549
02:51:45,744 --> 02:51:46,624
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what else is really sad?

2550
02:51:46,704 --> 02:51:47,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Hamtaro.

2551
02:51:48,105 --> 02:51:51,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I watched that horrible, horrible movie.

2552
02:51:53,548 --> 02:51:55,550
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if anyone has heard this, Unico.

2553
02:51:56,410 --> 02:51:57,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, of course, Unico.

2554
02:51:57,951 --> 02:51:58,952
[SPEAKER_11]: We all know you.

2555
02:51:59,232 --> 02:52:01,053
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I think is cool, by the way?

2556
02:52:01,533 --> 02:52:06,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that guys can only get away with really watching guys' cartoons, but women can watch whatever the hell we want.

2557
02:52:06,176 --> 02:52:07,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what would be your favorite then, Jamie?

2558
02:52:07,717 --> 02:52:08,557
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a moot point.

2559
02:52:08,577 --> 02:52:09,298
[SPEAKER_02]: For cheeky stuff?

2560
02:52:09,418 --> 02:52:10,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, cheeky, girly things.

2561
02:52:12,190 --> 02:52:13,091
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not Hello Kitty.

2562
02:52:13,531 --> 02:52:17,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm trying to think of stuff that's not anime, because there's shoujo and shounen anime.

2563
02:52:18,775 --> 02:52:28,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I think as far as anime is considered, I would have to go with Pre-Tier, The Legend of Snow White, which none of you probably have ever seen.

2564
02:52:30,383 --> 02:52:30,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

2565
02:52:31,384 --> 02:52:34,646
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as guy stuff goes, it'd freaking be Berserk.

2566
02:52:35,987 --> 02:52:38,449
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't watch freaking girly cartoons, so there!

2567
02:52:40,404 --> 02:52:41,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, me neither.

2568
02:52:42,625 --> 02:52:43,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what Unico is.

2569
02:52:43,265 --> 02:52:44,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you watch The Last Unicorn?

2570
02:52:44,966 --> 02:52:45,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the answer.

2571
02:52:45,866 --> 02:52:50,848
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was a kid, when I was younger, when I was in junior high, it was all about the Beverly Hills teens.

2572
02:52:51,088 --> 02:52:51,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

2573
02:52:51,748 --> 02:52:53,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god!

2574
02:52:54,869 --> 02:52:55,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Jem and the Holograms.

2575
02:52:55,870 --> 02:52:56,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

2576
02:52:56,770 --> 02:52:59,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really watch Jem, but Beverly Hills teens every damn day.

2577
02:53:00,051 --> 02:53:02,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a friend who has every episode of Jem on tape.

2578
02:53:05,444 --> 02:53:06,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they good quality?

2579
02:53:06,225 --> 02:53:08,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, or, and or, and this is the gimme.

2580
02:53:09,087 --> 02:53:11,709
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the one I'm sure everybody thought we would say, She-Ra.

2581
02:53:11,789 --> 02:53:12,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

2582
02:53:12,330 --> 02:53:13,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, She-Ra.

2583
02:53:13,991 --> 02:53:16,653
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was... With He-Man.

2584
02:53:17,073 --> 02:53:18,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, She-Ra was kind of a Xena.

2585
02:53:18,154 --> 02:53:21,777
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, this subliminal message of both series, buy this toy.

2586
02:53:22,618 --> 02:53:22,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2587
02:53:22,878 --> 02:53:23,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy this toy.

2588
02:53:23,839 --> 02:53:24,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

2589
02:53:24,219 --> 02:53:25,620
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be the last question, you guys.

2590
02:53:28,983 --> 02:53:29,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

2591
02:53:32,119 --> 02:53:33,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I'm trying to read through what Jay sent me.

2592
02:53:33,900 --> 02:53:37,001
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he was commenting on the relationship question.

2593
02:53:37,041 --> 02:53:38,041
[SPEAKER_04]: We got it answered in the chatroom.

2594
02:53:38,081 --> 02:53:39,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here we go.

2595
02:53:41,442 --> 02:53:43,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Rice, RYC3 wants to know, question for the freestyler.

2596
02:53:43,883 --> 02:53:44,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I forgot your name.

2597
02:53:44,663 --> 02:53:45,263
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be Bombay.

2598
02:53:46,003 --> 02:53:48,204
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, anybody can answer this though.

2599
02:53:48,244 --> 02:53:49,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody that has freestyled in the past can answer this.

2600
02:53:50,485 --> 02:53:50,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2601
02:53:50,885 --> 02:53:52,845
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you face your fear against the crowd?

2602
02:53:53,766 --> 02:53:54,146
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I?

2603
02:53:54,326 --> 02:53:54,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2604
02:53:54,626 --> 02:53:55,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent question.

2605
02:53:55,546 --> 02:53:56,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, wait, Ryan.

2606
02:53:57,187 --> 02:53:57,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan.

2607
02:54:00,629 --> 02:54:10,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, alright, well, how I face my fear is, I basically, when you don't think, like, when you're up there on the stage, it's like the same as PA, when you PA, you think of PA, right?

2608
02:54:11,298 --> 02:54:21,767
[SPEAKER_05]: The same thing with freestyle, when you're freestyling, you think about having fun, and, you know, just having a good time, you try not to think about, oh, what are they gonna think, you just have a good time, just be yourself, basically.

2609
02:54:22,367 --> 02:54:26,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the simple thing I've realized about freestyling altogether when it comes to the crowds.

2610
02:54:27,010 --> 02:54:30,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Is, first of all, just imagine, or pretend that you're practicing alone.

2611
02:54:31,073 --> 02:54:34,655
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nobody around you, and when you turn around, just don't see anybody there.

2612
02:54:35,076 --> 02:54:38,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that way you're not going to feel nervous at all, because it's just like you're practicing and having a good time on your own.

2613
02:54:39,899 --> 02:54:47,184
[SPEAKER_09]: No, like, what I do is, like, first of all, if you never want to feel nervous again, just first go up there naked.

2614
02:54:47,504 --> 02:54:49,906
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, like, everyone will, like, laugh and bust out.

2615
02:54:50,481 --> 02:54:54,864
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, like every other tournament, you'll just be like, man, this won't be as bad as last time when I was naked.

2616
02:54:57,766 --> 02:55:02,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, that one and only freestyle that we did, I'd forgotten that there was a crowd all together.

2617
02:55:03,009 --> 02:55:10,034
[SPEAKER_09]: And mainly, most of the time, the more outrageous stuff that you do that you would think would be embarrassing, people love it.

2618
02:55:10,094 --> 02:55:13,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Ryan in his Afronova outfit.

2619
02:55:13,817 --> 02:55:15,318
[SPEAKER_09]: And all the women would stand up cheering.

2620
02:55:16,699 --> 02:55:17,579
[SPEAKER_09]: And so would Rob.

2621
02:55:19,921 --> 02:55:20,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

2622
02:55:20,672 --> 02:55:24,576
[SPEAKER_22]: A grass skirt and a tiki mask, holding a spear, doing Afronova.

2623
02:55:25,757 --> 02:55:26,678
[SPEAKER_22]: That was great.

2624
02:55:26,959 --> 02:55:32,404
[SPEAKER_04]: My suggestion, my suggestion for the freestyle, because Jamie and I have done one freestyle, and it was pretty infamous, by the way.

2625
02:55:32,585 --> 02:55:34,727
[SPEAKER_04]: You can find that video still on DDR for a good thing.

2626
02:55:34,847 --> 02:55:36,489
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have yet to watch that, and I won't ever.

2627
02:55:37,129 --> 02:55:37,870
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have it somewhere.

2628
02:55:38,611 --> 02:55:45,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, my advice, get up there and don't give a flying fuck what anyone in that crowd feels about you.

2629
02:55:45,837 --> 02:55:47,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Just don't care what anyone thinks.

2630
02:55:47,819 --> 02:55:51,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Go up there for yourself to have fun, to just do it.

2631
02:55:51,142 --> 02:55:54,746
[SPEAKER_04]: And forget about everybody else, because their opinion doesn't mean shit.

2632
02:55:55,206 --> 02:55:59,751
[SPEAKER_06]: And one thing, too, is when you freestyle, don't really give a fuck about the arrows.

2633
02:55:59,992 --> 02:56:04,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Hit a few, but just mostly all people are watching is you dancing.

2634
02:56:04,557 --> 02:56:05,738
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not watching the arrows.

2635
02:56:09,202 --> 02:56:11,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Half the people who watch you freestyle don't even know what the fuck you're doing anyway.

2636
02:56:12,466 --> 02:56:13,907
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just watching you dance.

2637
02:56:14,207 --> 02:56:18,068
[SPEAKER_06]: So, fuck the arrows, hit just enough to pass, and have a good time.

2638
02:56:18,308 --> 02:56:24,090
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't even worry if you look good or not, because if someone says you suck, challenge them to get up there and do the same.

2639
02:56:24,691 --> 02:56:27,852
[SPEAKER_06]: I have an example of Kid Zero when he did Stomp to My Beat.

2640
02:56:28,252 --> 02:56:28,832
[SPEAKER_05]: He failed!

2641
02:56:29,152 --> 02:56:29,833
[SPEAKER_05]: He failed!

2642
02:56:30,193 --> 02:56:34,194
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody still was like cheering their asses off because it was such a good freestyle.

2643
02:56:34,274 --> 02:56:35,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though he failed, it looked so good.

2644
02:56:36,715 --> 02:56:40,557
[SPEAKER_04]: You may or may not remember at Shaft when Tran actually failed his routine the first time.

2645
02:56:40,857 --> 02:56:42,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Crowd demanded he go again.

2646
02:56:43,158 --> 02:56:48,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, well, I mean, there was also the other circumstance going on where he meant to do fourth mix and the fourth mix was broken so he had to do the sim.

2647
02:56:49,120 --> 02:56:50,561
[SPEAKER_04]: But he ended up taking second place.

2648
02:56:50,841 --> 02:56:51,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too shabby.

2649
02:56:54,382 --> 02:56:57,404
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my bad for not turning auto-fail off.

2650
02:56:57,804 --> 02:56:58,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Dope.

2651
02:57:01,304 --> 02:57:02,986
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so that's it for Ask Orange Lounge.

2652
02:57:03,006 --> 02:57:03,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, you guys.

2653
02:57:03,587 --> 02:57:04,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Good questions this week.

2654
02:57:04,508 --> 02:57:04,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

2655
02:57:04,908 --> 02:57:06,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Our chairman's getting very good at this stuff.

2656
02:57:06,751 --> 02:57:06,971
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2657
02:57:07,432 --> 02:57:09,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And they mostly said to be money.

2658
02:57:10,676 --> 02:57:10,936
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2659
02:57:11,917 --> 02:57:12,698
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it, you guys.

2660
02:57:13,159 --> 02:57:14,020
[SPEAKER_04]: We're at the end of the show.

2661
02:57:15,487 --> 02:57:45,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but we're gonna get around to the final thoughts So here's your chance Final thoughts, starting with the guests Bombay Okay, my final thought is to Scandia's policy It's kind of like a continuation of my fuck you It's a fuck you to Scandia's policy I work there, as people know now I work there, and on weekends they have a policy Friday after 5 o'clock is considered a weekend I'm not allowed to be there on weekends So Friday after 5 o'clock, I'm not allowed to be there Saturday and Sunday, I'm also not allowed to be there At all There, the end

2662
02:57:48,388 --> 02:57:49,228
[SPEAKER_04]: In turn zero?

2663
02:57:50,129 --> 02:57:50,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much.

2664
02:57:51,809 --> 02:57:54,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Just goes along with the freestyle thing.

2665
02:57:54,430 --> 02:57:55,230
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one last thing.

2666
02:57:56,070 --> 02:57:57,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Just have fun with it.

2667
02:57:57,311 --> 02:57:58,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't even care how you look.

2668
02:57:59,111 --> 02:58:02,532
[SPEAKER_06]: And for everyone else playing DDR, just go and have fun with it.

2669
02:58:02,692 --> 02:58:04,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't even bother what other people think of you.

2670
02:58:04,913 --> 02:58:05,973
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to add something to that.

2671
02:58:06,153 --> 02:58:09,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, just like, you know, look like you're having fun.

2672
02:58:09,994 --> 02:58:12,515
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're up there concentrating too hard, it's not going to look good.

2673
02:58:12,695 --> 02:58:13,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

2674
02:58:13,275 --> 02:58:16,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Bruce Leroy, many say he won Cyber Beat on his expressions.

2675
02:58:16,676 --> 02:58:16,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Period.

2676
02:58:17,165 --> 02:58:25,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and also when I was making up the grading sheets for Shaft, that was the big thing I had in there, you know, how well they react with the audience.

2677
02:58:27,388 --> 02:58:29,388
[SPEAKER_02]: It counted for a quarter of their score.

2678
02:58:29,488 --> 02:58:31,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2679
02:58:32,369 --> 02:58:34,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, DVR College is back.

2680
02:58:35,210 --> 02:58:35,730
[SPEAKER_19]: Have comments?

2681
02:58:37,344 --> 02:58:49,993
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I miss most of the show, but if you guys are talking about freestyling, my input would be to just have fun because it seems like no matter what happens, the crowd likes freestyling, even if you suck.

2682
02:58:50,173 --> 02:58:53,015
[SPEAKER_19]: They don't want to see you just stomp.

2683
02:58:53,196 --> 02:58:54,517
[SPEAKER_19]: They want to see you do something.

2684
02:58:56,498 --> 02:59:01,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Find the closest person to the stage and go dry hump their leg.

2685
02:59:01,362 --> 02:59:01,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2686
02:59:02,685 --> 02:59:03,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Winner!

2687
02:59:03,105 --> 02:59:07,367
[SPEAKER_19]: Do anything and, you know, don't have any fear because there's nothing to fear.

2688
02:59:07,987 --> 02:59:08,287
[SPEAKER_19]: That's it.

2689
02:59:09,287 --> 02:59:16,670
[SPEAKER_06]: One last thing too is if little kids run across the crosswalk, feel free to kick a little leg out there and let them just do cartwheel right off the side of the thing after you kick them.

2690
02:59:18,230 --> 02:59:20,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering if anyone in here remembers Big Cans.

2691
02:59:22,664 --> 02:59:26,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob's half-finished edit to Kick the Can started off really hard, and then there was nothing else.

2692
02:59:27,089 --> 02:59:30,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when the fourth mix was there at Golfland.

2693
02:59:30,994 --> 02:59:34,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was Rick and Paul just ran off and started running all over Golfland.

2694
02:59:35,796 --> 02:59:37,818
[SPEAKER_09]: They were like doing bar hops and slapping hands across it.

2695
02:59:37,838 --> 02:59:40,260
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they hopped off and started running around the arcade too.

2696
02:59:40,700 --> 02:59:42,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2697
02:59:42,301 --> 02:59:47,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Me and Pat also, I wear orange beanie.

2698
02:59:48,306 --> 02:59:50,868
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have a freestyle to Tsugaru.

2699
02:59:51,048 --> 02:59:51,889
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Matsuragi Japan.

2700
02:59:52,009 --> 02:59:52,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

2701
02:59:54,211 --> 02:59:58,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Where we just run around the arcade and just like, that's about it.

2702
02:59:59,235 --> 03:00:00,596
[SPEAKER_02]: You love to meet Maniac Little.

2703
03:00:01,256 --> 03:00:01,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

2704
03:00:01,997 --> 03:00:04,859
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like, what is it, 32 measures of no steps.

2705
03:00:04,979 --> 03:00:05,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

2706
03:00:06,741 --> 03:00:07,542
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2707
03:00:07,862 --> 03:00:08,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, your final thoughts?

2708
03:00:08,963 --> 03:00:17,431
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thoughts, since we didn't cover it, the StepChart site went down, just so everyone knows, because that's, you know, kind of major news and stuff.

2709
03:00:17,792 --> 03:00:19,153
[SPEAKER_10]: So StepChart site went down.

2710
03:00:19,894 --> 03:00:21,936
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a new one coming back up, so look for that.

2711
03:00:22,737 --> 03:00:23,357
[SPEAKER_10]: My site...

2712
03:00:24,458 --> 03:00:25,139
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm working on it.

2713
03:00:26,039 --> 03:00:30,822
[SPEAKER_10]: There's actually going to be a complete... I'm going to redo all the graphics again, actually, because I don't like the way they are right now.

2714
03:00:31,002 --> 03:00:31,963
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going to make it simpler.

2715
03:00:32,243 --> 03:00:44,030
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're lucky, if you're very, very lucky, I might upload second style through fourth style all the DWIs I have for that tomorrow, if you're lucky.

2716
03:00:46,471 --> 03:01:06,558
[SPEAKER_09]: All I gotta say is that me and Johnny, like, a few weeks ago, we started, like, it was at, like, 3 o'clock in the morning in my car, and, cause we were, like, parked outside someone's house, and, anyway, and so we were, like, really late, and we were trying to, like, rap and shit, and he's like, okay, David, go!

2717
03:01:07,219 --> 03:01:07,959
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'm like...

2718
03:01:08,679 --> 03:01:16,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Yo, I went to McDonald's, and like, we started making all these weird names to like, uh, to fast food chains.

2719
03:01:17,161 --> 03:01:21,281
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we have, we have, it's called our ghetto slang for fast food chains.

2720
03:01:21,501 --> 03:01:21,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2721
03:01:21,781 --> 03:01:22,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, that rhymed here.

2722
03:01:23,002 --> 03:01:23,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Burger King!

2723
03:01:23,982 --> 03:01:28,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we have, okay, for now, for now, we have McDonald's.

2724
03:01:28,583 --> 03:01:29,603
[SPEAKER_05]: That's McDonald's.

2725
03:01:29,983 --> 03:01:31,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Burger King!

2726
03:01:31,103 --> 03:01:35,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Burger King, and finally... No, no, no, we got two more, two more, yeah.

2727
03:01:36,184 --> 03:01:43,086
[SPEAKER_08]: We got Delta Cop, which is Del Taco, and Jack in the Box is Jack in a Bow.

2728
03:01:43,907 --> 03:01:44,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah!

2729
03:01:44,807 --> 03:01:46,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I still prefer Yak in the Box.

2730
03:01:48,268 --> 03:01:50,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, that's what we have.

2731
03:01:52,669 --> 03:01:53,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Delta Cop!

2732
03:01:55,170 --> 03:01:56,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Blink, blink, blink.

2733
03:01:56,771 --> 03:02:01,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, my final thought is that choking when you're drinking water live on air really sucks.

2734
03:02:02,093 --> 03:02:02,733
[SPEAKER_04]: That just happened to me.

2735
03:02:02,993 --> 03:02:03,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie?

2736
03:02:03,233 --> 03:02:03,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie?

2737
03:02:04,349 --> 03:02:06,050
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is that scars are cool.

2738
03:02:06,950 --> 03:02:07,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Scars are cool.

2739
03:02:07,710 --> 03:02:08,190
[SPEAKER_02]: They're sexy.

2740
03:02:08,751 --> 03:02:09,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you everybody much for listening.

2741
03:02:09,891 --> 03:02:11,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all the guests for being here tonight.

2742
03:02:11,692 --> 03:02:12,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Lovely as always.

[SPEAKER_04]: Next week... Thank you for having me.

2744
03:02:15,393 --> 03:02:19,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week we'll either be coming to you from the studio of Jamie or we'll be pre-taped.

2745
03:02:19,354 --> 03:02:19,874
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know yet.

2746
03:02:20,054 --> 03:02:20,615
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll think about it.

2747
03:02:20,635 --> 03:02:22,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Most likely studio of Jamie but we don't know yet.

2748
03:02:22,475 --> 03:02:24,356
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe I'll do a fuck-up on Thursday.

2749
03:02:25,277 --> 03:02:29,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and the Cyber Beat special was delayed, so it's going to be this Friday and Saturday, because we got lazy.

2750
03:02:30,042 --> 03:02:30,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, or I did.

2751
03:02:31,003 --> 03:02:35,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, some of the requests, I have some requests, some things you guys requested us to play.

2752
