1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
message for you sir, attention!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
you're listening to orange lounge radio, the monty talk and then some

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
orange lounge may contain adult content, orange lounge may contain many four letter words

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
orange lounge may contain a scene of nudity

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,500
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex. In this episode...

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,500
Hey, are there any balls down there?

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,000
About the biggest berry you ever seen, Diggleberry.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What's your favorite scary movie?

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Showgirls. Absolutely frightening. What's yours?

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,500
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Now's the time on Shrock, it's going to be dogs!

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,500
I know Kung Fu.

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Why did they have to take the word day?

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,500
No! What I expect for punishing positions is gentle.

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,000
Hey!

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,500
Dark Sakura.

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,000
Shut up! Where's my gun? This is my boomstick.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Sky.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Come on, girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Loki.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What kind of warped human being would find that funny?

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Orange Lounge Radio

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We are live, and this is episode number 37 for March 9th. No, it's not the 9th, it's the 16th of 2003.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Rob's doing the time warp again.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hello. You're tuned into Mamani Scene's most buzzin' radio station of all things Mamani.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Sounds like a fart.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,040
Heim is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,160
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts. In this corner, the happiest bunny on the

35
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,560
farm is Jamie Summers. You know her better as Dark Sakura.

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,840
I'm not happy. In that corner, say hello to our Tech Masoloki.

37
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,800
Hello. And with us here also in the studio tonight,

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,040
we have? Here!

39
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:15,600
Nobody! This is amazing! There is nobody else here tonight. It is just the three of us.

40
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,360
This is craziness. Zero's not even here. He was supposed to be here tonight.

41
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
Yeah, I guess.

42
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,120
subwoofer and then we won't hear anything but I think they still get the

43
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,180
buzzing even subwoofers off but I don't know so life sucks and you'll just have

44
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,740
to bear with us tonight we'll do what we can but in the meantime we're gonna play

45
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,700
some break songs and what songs are we gonna hear this break these are songs

46
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:14,700
songs that no one listens to, but you're gonna do now, so enjoy. We'll be back.

47
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,700
are

48
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,700
are

49
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,700
are

50
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,700
are

51
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,700
are

52
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,700
are

53
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,700
are

54
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,700
Hey!

55
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,700
Hey!

56
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,700
Hey!

57
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,700
Hey!

58
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,700
Hey!

59
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:17,700
Now let's go, now we're free

60
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:36,380
Hello, hello, is this thing on testing?

61
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,380
Testing one, two.

62
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,380
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

63
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,380
Hello? I don't understand this. This thing works.

64
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,380
This thing reads like stereo instructions.

65
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,380
Is this on?

66
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,380
What the hell?

67
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,380
Orange Lounge Radio. Broke-down ghetto bimani radio.

68
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,380
WHAT THE F***

69
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,860
I'm a

70
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,860
I'm

71
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,580
I'm

72
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,700
we're supposed to be back before that was over positive about that now it is

73
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,060
is that irony or what

74
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,180
that you know broke down ghetto ass radio and then we can't even get our

75
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,380
fuckin' volume to work

76
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,180
We can't get it up! We're impotent!

77
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,000
we actually what's funny is that during the break I was trying to fix the buzzing

78
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,380
problem we've got tonight

79
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,580
and I went behind the computer and kinda unplugged the splitter cuz

80
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,260
Loki said, hey, look at the splitter, maybe something's wrong with that, and lo and behold,

81
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,820
I went and I plugged it back in the wrong hole.

82
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,380
I stuck it in the wrong hole!

83
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,940
Okay, Rob, do you have hole priorities here?

84
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,340
Yeah, I have hole problems.

85
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,380
I think I'm dyslexic!

86
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,740
Anyway, in that break of little-played Bimani songs, pretty controversial in the chat room,

87
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,940
because every time one of them would play something, they'd go, hey, I play that!

88
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,940
We had Changma...

89
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,460
How many people really play Minimillion?

90
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,540
Thank you.

91
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,880
We had Chang Ma, would love this feelin', and then Minna Melon from 4th Style, which

92
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,220
was also the background music in 3rd Style, if I'm not mistaken, blink blink.

93
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,340
Yes, I think so.

94
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:04,100
And then after that, the sampling masters with tablets, from 5th Style.

95
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,380
And then Usama Kaboto with Presto, which is somewhat debatable, because actually a lot

96
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,420
of people play that song, but what happened is I was actually looking for Five Regrets,

97
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,820
and I couldn't find it.

98
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,740
So then I tried to find, I was gonna put 1989 in, but a lot of people would have beat me

99
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:29,500
up if I played 1989? And then we played about half of Sanctus before we decided to spare

100
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:36,120
you all and come back. Which is interesting because Sanctus is in Dance Maniacs. If there

101
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,220
was ever a song that just doesn't make sense in a Bomani game, Sanctus in Dance Maniacs

102
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:52,540
I don't get every Kubota song could have been in keyboard mania yes presto was

103
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,820
you are listening to Orange House radio and again we apologize for having some

104
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,020
buzzing issues tonight we don't know what's causing it we've dissected

105
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:03,900
everything going on about the only way I think I'd be a bee is angry for you know

106
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:10,140
you to facing its song so I don't know what we can do about it we'll just have

107
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,180
zero the orange lounge intern had a little get-together at his house

108
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,580
and we decided to do a little bit drinking because it was mostly older folks who were

109
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,780
there over 21 so we

110
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:52,660
we decided to bust out a little bit of liquor. I had my one triple shot of

111
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,460
that imported tequila. I had about half a glass of aftershock

112
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:01,660
not a shot but half a glass. I had half a glass of aftershock. I had whatever it was that Irene

113
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,900
made me do. Irene knew, you know,

114
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,300
what I've been needing for about the past year and Irene made me a cocksucker which is

115
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,860
Irish cream mixed with butterscotch schnapps and again, she didn't make me a shot. It's supposed to be a shot drink

116
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,040
I was made a full glass

117
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,440
Yeah, and I drank just about the whole thing except for a couple sips

118
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,820
So needless to say after half a glass aftershock and that I was pretty fucked up

119
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,520
So, I don't know. I was running around the house yelling things. I don't know what I was doing

120
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,280
And then I fell asleep too after about 45 minutes

121
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,280
And that was it.

122
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,280
It wasn't long at all.

123
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,280
I'm like, Rob's drunk, and I'm like, oh, ready?

124
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Shit, man.

125
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,280
I didn't even finish sitting at the pads yet, and you're already drunk.

126
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Hey, wait a minute.

127
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,280
Wait a minute.

128
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,280
That's not fair, because you guys ran to the store.

129
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,280
They did.

130
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,280
Poor Ice Queen spent a bunch on liquor.

131
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,280
Which reminds me, he's not here, and he's supposed to be.

132
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
I need to call him and see where he's at.

133
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,280
What did I do with my phone?

134
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,280
You dropped it over the side of the desk.

135
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
Did I?

136
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Oh, I sure did.

137
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
Yes, you did.

138
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Let's call Ice Queen and see where he's at.

139
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
On the air.

140
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
We're not Broke-Ass Ghetto.

141
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,280
Well, we've got nothing else to talk about tonight.

142
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Yeah, we do.

143
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,280
We don't really ever do phone calls on the air because myself...

144
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
We have two weeks till tournament.

145
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,800
Do you want to talk about tournament while I call Matt?

146
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,880
There's nothing going on at all.

147
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,320
It's just dead.

148
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,200
It's been like this for like the last three months.

149
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Nothing is happening.

150
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,000
Well, March Madness isn't for two weeks.

151
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,040
Yeah, I mean, we can talk about that next week because nothing's going to happen next

152
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
week anyways.

153
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,040
If one were you, Diggy?

154
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,040
Sad. Nothing is happening.

155
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Shit, it went out. My phone sucks in here.

156
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
Mine got three bars.

157
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
You call Matt then.

158
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
No. You can use my phone.

159
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,040
Okay.

160
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
Rob's gonna use my phone.

161
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
I'm gonna use the phone.

162
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,040
What else is new in your sim this week, Matt?

163
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
That we were all playing on last night?

164
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,040
Uh, just more stuff I downloaded.

165
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,040
I've been trying to work on it.

166
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:08,340
and stuff, but yeah. I've got up through Fifth Mix all ready to go. So, you know, it's ready

167
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:12,740
for Monday. I'll probably upload this Monday. So, up through Fifth Mix. Pretty much everything

168
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:18,620
you'd see in Bimani is stellar right now. I'm trying to get Max and Max2 done before

169
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:24,220
maybe tonight. Have those up and maybe submit everything else. But, yeah, I ran into some

170
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,800
problems with the DDR Extreme files because not just one person's making them, but actually

171
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,420
a whole bunch of different people are making them and they're all out of sync or just awful

172
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:39,880
and so I have to like, you know, fix those two and that sucks and I don't really want

173
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:45,560
to and I probably won't, but yeah, there'll be more stuff and you know what, I don't have

174
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,520
like no, I don't have a hidden page this week because I'm lazy and I just didn't get around

175
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,400
to it and you know what, I don't care.

176
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
Here's a shot.

177
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,040
and uh...

178
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,480
well shit man i mean

179
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,760
well oh let's go to make let's make a hidden page of one sim file or uh... i

180
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,080
don't know i'll release release like three hundred tomorrow

181
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,040
yeah decisions

182
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,240
so you can have the one or the three hundred one

183
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,920
fine that's all i know what sim file i'm going to upload then let them move and that's it

184
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,640
yay just to be the single sim file

185
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,160
no i don't know i've got more stuff

186
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,080
What else has been going on this week?

187
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,860
Loki and I are planning a move and we decided on the apartment we want to go to, so the

188
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,760
show is going to be moving.

189
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,080
Yes, we have an orgasmic fountain at the new complex.

190
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
Multiple orgasms.

191
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,520
Yeah, it's like a multiple orgasm fountain.

192
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,460
It flickers a little bit of water and then all of a sudden it's like gush, gush, gush

193
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,180
and then back to a little bit.

194
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,620
I lost my job.

195
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,620
That sucks.

196
00:17:53,620 --> 00:18:01,820
Like Sierra Pacific Mortgage, there are 11,000 Olson Drive Rancho Cordova, CA, Suite 202.

197
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:09,900
Go there with a grenade launcher aimed at the office of the shipping department.

198
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,540
Why did you lose your job?

199
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,540
I don't know.

200
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,540
They never told me.

201
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,480
It's a temp assignment.

202
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,220
I think it's because I was being paid more than the other temps because I'm cooler than

203
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,220
they are.

204
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,100
So like, we don't want to pay her.

205
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
She costs too much money and she's too damn good.

206
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,100
Megamix?

207
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,100
I've never heard of it.

208
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,340
What the hell are you talking about?

209
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,340
Let's see.

210
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,700
I've never heard of what you're talking about here.

211
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,940
There's a link, I think.

212
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,940
I don't know.

213
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,940
I don't know what the hell they're talking about.

214
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,940
Megamix.

215
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,140
Is this it?

216
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,140
Here we go!

217
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,900
Konami is, in fact, hard at work with a new dancing stage game, and this time it's for

218
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,900
the PS2.

219
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,380
They have licensed new songs for it, and the data is set to a May release in Europe.

220
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,700
There are ten licensed songs in the mix, some of them are as follows.

221
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,060
Ms. Dynamite, It Takes More Elvis, A Little Less Conversation

222
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:33,420
Kylie Minogue, Love at First Sight The Sugar Babes, Freak Like Me

223
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,820
Christina Milian, When You Look at Me The Cure, Love Cats

224
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,820
That's crazy.

225
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,940
It will also feature twenty original tracks created by the Konami development team.

226
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,420
It will also have the normal features like Arcade Mode, Practice Mode, and Workout Mode.

227
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,460
It will also feature a tutorial mode for beginners.

228
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,660
Once again, I've been saying this before, it really sucks that Euromix stuff gets better

229
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,860
music than our fucking U.S. mixes.

230
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:03,860
They started putting licensed tracks in our first one, but ever since the get-go for Dancing

231
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,940
Stage they've had licensed tracks that are exclusive to them, and I think that sucks

232
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,940
ass.

233
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:14,540
But yeah, the one day I'm not on the internet, there's stuff happening, and I hate that.

234
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,540
It's like I'm on the internet all the fucking time. All day long on the fucking internet.

235
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:27,540
Waiting for something to happen. Nothing ever happens. Then I turn it off, boom! Something happens. I hate that.

236
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:33,540
Let's see what else. We're just leeching news right now from ddrmaniax.net.

237
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,540
Oh yeah, DDR Big Brother.

238
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,540
Giving a little credit where credit's due. What'd you have? You had a suggestion, Jamie?

239
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:44,540
Failing lists work. I have their address. That's what I should do.

240
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,540
Never mind. I was thinking of ways of getting revenge against that woman.

241
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,540
Oh, Jamie's plotting revenge on her work.

242
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,540
Former work.

243
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,540
Former work.

244
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:57,540
Also, DDR Media X is reporting, and this is kind of neat.

245
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,540
DDR was on Big Brother.

246
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,540
Oh, Dancing Stage.

247
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,540
I'm sorry, Dancing Stage was on Big Brother.

248
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,540
Not Big Brother in the U.S., but Big Brother because Big Brother in the U.S. only airs in the summer.

249
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:12,160
but it was on Big Brother in Norway.

250
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:18,360
They had their very own dancing stage machine, and they have this little picture here when

251
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,640
they're all playing on the machine, and one chick in the back says, fuck the machine,

252
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,240
I'm going to play on the Nordic track.

253
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
That's what she's doing.

254
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,320
And then there's this bald guy looking on going, what are they doing?

255
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,540
And then there's these two chicks kind of dancing, and it's obvious that they're...

256
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,540
It sucked, and then coming onto message boards today, guess what? It sucked.

257
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,540
Shock? MTV programming sucks? Wow.

258
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,540
Shock of shocks.

259
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,540
Oh my god.

260
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,540
When did that happen?

261
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:54,540
Who knows? Maybe y'all. And knowing MTV, don't worry. If you didn't see it, they'll re-run it 50 times.

262
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,540
So just, you know, look in your TV guide.

263
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:00,540
The downfall of MTV began with the banishment of Martha Quinn.

264
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,540
The loss of Kennedy, I concur.

265
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:36,140
You know what sucks about Road Rules though?

266
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,140
It's old.

267
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,140
It's fucking old.

268
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,380
They do the same thing every year.

269
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,500
Same shit, new location.

270
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,300
There's some fag, there's some bitch, there's some black guy, and they all fight all the

271
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,300
time.

272
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,300
That's what they do.

273
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,300
The show's getting old.

274
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,780
And then there's like the one person who goes, okay.

275
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,780
Yeah.

276
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,780
And then there's the virgin.

277
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,780
You know, the chick that's like, oh, I'm a Mormon and I'm never going to do anything

278
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,780
bad.

279
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,180
And she gets fucked three ways from, you know, yesterday.

280
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,740
I still want to be on the real world.

281
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,860
I want to be on the real world, so I should be on the real world.

282
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,700
See, I wouldn't start fights with anyone, but I'd just be totally strange.

283
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,100
I'd just be the weird guy.

284
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:16,260
The guy that sits in the corner like, dude, that guy's weird, man.

285
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,060
I don't know what it is, but it's weird.

286
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,660
Like, they come to talk to me, and you just, like, start screaming, you know, weird shit

287
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,660
like that.

288
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,220
Anybody that listens to this show knows that you'd be the crazy racist and homophobe.

289
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,220
I'm not the crazy racist, homo-folk guy.

290
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,220
Fucking A man.

291
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,220
Hello man, I'm going to be living with you.

292
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,220
Shit man.

293
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,220
That's why they have auditions for these shows.

294
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,220
See, if I were on any of these programs, I would be sitting in the back of my Game Boy.

295
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,220
And the Game Boy reading a book.

296
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,220
We should do something though.

297
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,220
We should do our own reality show.

298
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,220
Orange Lounge Reality Radio.

299
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,220
This kind of is reality radio because it's not like we talk about Bimani ever.

300
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:02,020
No, I mean we should get a video camera and go on a weekend road trip or something and

301
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,780
videotape it and post it on the internet.

302
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,260
This is what we do.

303
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,860
This is the thing is I tried to do that for Cyberbeat and it came out really really bad.

304
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,860
Did you have a video camera?

305
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,460
I don't even think it ever aired.

306
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,180
No, I didn't have a video camera.

307
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,180
See if we can get a video camera and go.

308
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,180
I'm so excited.

309
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,180
So we'll see.

310
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:51,740
Well, you realize that if we get to go, you know who else is going to be there?

311
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,740
Who?

312
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,740
Dan is going because he's a manager.

313
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,740
Woohoo!

314
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,740
Well, that's cool.

315
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,740
Then you'll get to go.

316
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,980
For all the people who remember my fiance on our lovely radio show here, you get the

317
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,460
Dan experience.

318
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,460
Very cool.

319
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:10,260
So if that happens, we will do an E3 reality show, but we're still kind of hanging out

320
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,700
to see if it's going to happen or not.

321
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,700
I mean, I don't know.

322
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,300
I don't know, that sounds hopeful but I'm kind of like I don't know, but we might have

323
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,300
an in.

324
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,980
And it's very exciting so I'm moist with anticipation, as should all of you, because the E3 rules.

325
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,860
Why are you messing with my shoes you're like-

326
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:29,240
So yeah, DDR on Big Brother.

327
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,900
I think you should try out for Big Brother.

328
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,180
I would try out for Big Brother.

329
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,900
I think I'd be awesome on the show.

330
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,080
I'd f***ing win Big Brother.

331
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:42,140
Big Brother is the one where they have no computers, no news, no TVs or nothing.

332
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,340
just in a house with cameras watching them 24 hours a day, and they just all have to

333
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,340
like co-exist.

334
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,500
I would do nothing but read the whole time.

335
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,500
I'd have withdrawals.

336
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,500
Ahh!

337
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,500
Shaky!

338
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,180
They don't let you bring books.

339
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,180
So...

340
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,180
I'll bring a book somehow.

341
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,180
I'll write a book.

342
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,180
You sneak a book in your bra.

343
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,180
I'll write a book.

344
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,340
I draw the arrows on the ground.

345
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,020
What are you doing, man?

346
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,860
You know, and what's funny about Big Brother, at least in the U.S. anyway, Big Brother in

347
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:17,620
the US, the first season was shit. It was absolute shit because it was totally not cast

348
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,620
well at all.

349
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,620
Interviewer2. Did they make them do anything?

350
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,460
Man 2. Yeah, they have to do stupid little challenges every week, but like in the first

351
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:28,700
season some of their challenges were having to make papier-mâché. It was shit. But then

352
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,560
the second season it started to get a little better. I didn't watch the second season because

353
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,600
the first season was so bad that I wouldn't watch the second season. But I heard that's

354
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,220
what started getting better. And then this last season was really good, last season was

355
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,220
good.

356
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:46,220
finally got some... you're a bitch! You made Pippi Longstocking out of my shoes! Anyway,

357
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,780
yeah, the last season of Big Brother was pretty good. And I could see, totally see them doing

358
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,740
something like this, where they bring it, then that's what they do, is they just kind

359
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:57,620
of drop a toy on them, like, and then in the next week, they would probably have to do

360
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,500
like whoever's the best at DDR gets to win, gets to go out for dinner.

361
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,660
Oh man, I would love that. It's like they do the same thing for that show and you're

362
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,620
on the show. Dude, NC, I would... They're all playing in there all, okay, who's the

363
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:13,840
best of all start busting up like oh my god I just don't even try you know I'd

364
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,560
fake it like for that whole week I'd fake it that I really suck at DDR and

365
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,660
then like the last day of it I just go fucking nuts win the dinner and

366
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,460
everybody would hate me and I'd get voted out suddenly dawned on to me as

367
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:29,780
you're there you know paying back yeah it's like it just clicked I don't know

368
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:35,600
oh my god it's not like I don't play this oh oh yeah Jamie's gonna fix my

369
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:43,480
shoes. I have some more really important Bahmani news, or Bahmani related news. It's not really

370
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,900
directly Bahmani news, but it's about a Bahmani artist. I have some really important Bahmani

371
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:55,040
news that we need to take care of. And it's about a lady who is in Max 2, and you probably

372
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:00,040
know this song. She's Ginger Spice, and she did a song called It's Rainin' Men. You all

373
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:05,380
know that song. She's not a Spice girl, but she used to be. But there was big revelations

374
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,360
about Jerry Halliwell this week.

375
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,320
And this is the way the story goes.

376
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:17,600
Ex Spice Girl Jerry admits she had a lesbian fling.

377
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,280
So former Spice Girl Jerry Halliwell says she has had a brief encounter with another

378
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,560
woman but denies she's a lesbian.

379
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,360
So she's not joining tattoo or anything.

380
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,040
Remember, try it but don't like it.

381
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,440
The singer who was dated, fellow pop star Robbie Williams, told Thursday's Sun tabloid

382
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,560
that after the fling she quickly realized that she was not gay.

383
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,320
I had a little lesbian thing, she said, adding the encounter with an unnamed woman had been

384
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,560
part of experimenting.

385
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,540
She refused to pinpoint the date, but said it was somewhere between the ages of sixteen

386
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,540
and thirty.

387
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:53,160
Yeah, it's sometime between now and never.

388
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,180
It was just a drunken moment.

389
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:00,840
She also says, you wanna go home and have sex with me?

390
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:08,680
The singer also said she was not in a relationship but present.

391
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,560
I would like to be in a loving relationship, but it has to be with someone who is trustworthy

392
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,840
and kind and sweet, and also my equal, she said.

393
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,000
And a man.

394
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,340
Halliwell or Ginger Spice, as she was known during her time with the band, left the Spice

395
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:26,380
Girls in 1998 amid reports- Or the only cute Spice Girl that wasn't Butch.

396
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,380
Amid reports of her squabbling.

397
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,280
She looked like a drag queen.

398
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,280
Whatever.

399
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,640
The 30-year-old singer is currently hosting the U.S. television beauty and talent show

400
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,280
All-American Girl, which, by the way, funny enough, All-American Girl was the name of

401
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:43,500
Margaret Cho's show, a much, much different program, also on ABC.

402
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,980
Can you believe they blatantly just took that name, especially after Margaret Cho's movie

403
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,180
about the hell she went through on that show?

404
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,460
Well, you know what's funny is they're having a...

405
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,820
There's a microphone in my face.

406
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,940
Howard Stern is actually, you know that show Are You Hot?

407
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,940
Yes.

408
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:03,020
the producers of that show because it was his idea.

409
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:08,260
If you go to SmokingGun.com, which is my favorite website on the entire internet, you can read

410
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:14,960
the court documents of Howard Stern filing the lawsuit with ABC because apparently he

411
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,860
used to do this bit on his show and it's been a long time since I've listened to Howard

412
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,860
Stern in it.

413
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,860
I never even saw that.

414
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,580
I used to watch the E-Show and I used to listen to it in the morning, but I never saw this

415
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,580
segment.

416
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,580
But I guess it's been on for a while.

417
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:31,220
Was the Examiners or the Examiners, what was it called, the, I don't know, but they would

418
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,260
I think it was called the same thing, actually No, it wasn't called Are You Hot, it had something

419
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,580
else Still, I even thought that they were ripping

420
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,740
that off of that website, Are You Hot or Not, I mean, it's exactly

421
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:44,540
They suit them too, because they have that, I've never watched the show because I don't

422
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:49,420
watch crap, but like, they have this big sign from a picture I saw that says hot or not,

423
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,380
and then the contestant is standing under it and I guess it lights up if they're hot

424
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:58,020
or not, and I guess, uh, uh, what's his name, that one guy, oh god, what's his fucking name,

425
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:04,020
that guy, he was on chips or something I think? Eric Estrada? I think he's a judge. I don't

426
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,780
know. Well they have, uh, Lorenzo Lamas as a judge. Oh, him, nevermind, I'm getting Eric

427
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,380
Estrada mixed up with Lorenzo Lamas. I don't know how or why, but I do. Yeah, I don't like

428
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:18,740
women with fake breasts. Uh, wait, wait, hold on, let's flashback for a second here. Uh,

429
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:25,740
Weren't you just, weren't you dating, or say, married to a Playboy model, uh, you know,

430
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,740
just to fill you in?

431
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,740
Guess what?

432
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,740
They weren't real.

433
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,740
Not real.

434
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,740
Fake breasts.

435
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,740
Breasts aren't supposed to be like solid plastic.

436
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:39,740
I mean, when she hits the wall, they're supposed to kind of like give a little bit, not like

437
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,740
crush through them.

438
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,740
So-

439
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,740
It's a surgical flotation device.

440
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,740
It's a bath toy.

441
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:54,220
In case of Wanderlanding, the bosom may be used as a flotation device.

442
00:32:54,220 --> 00:33:00,060
So this begs the topic that we need to do a new segment here on OrangeLawnsRadio, called

443
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,060
DDR Hot or Not.

444
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:04,180
And basically the way this would work is you're going to send a picture, but it has to be

445
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,540
a picture of you playing DDR.

446
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,100
Not just a generic picture, it has to be a picture of you playing DDR, or any bimani

447
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,100
I guess would work.

448
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,900
And no, I don't know.

449
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,180
Are we not accepting any nude photos of people playing DDR?

450
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:22,300
I don't want to see that shit unless you really are hot.

451
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,300
Only if you're really, really hot, and people tell you that on a daily basis.

452
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,780
Then nude photos are okay.

453
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:31,340
But if you don't get told that every day, don't send it.

454
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:37,380
So you're just going to send it to orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com, and we'll let you know how you rank, okay?

455
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,100
And Howard Stern can sue us if he wants, but you know, you can't get blood out of a turnip.

456
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,580
So send your photos, graphs of you playing DDR and we'll let you know if you're hot or

457
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,580
not.

458
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:52,700
And what we'll do, huh?

459
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,600
And remember that all pictures submitted become the property of Orange Lounge Radio.

460
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,480
We say that because we're going to put your pictures on our website.

461
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,660
Because this is radio, obviously, other people are going to need to see these somehow.

462
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:07,740
So we're going to put your pictures up on the site so that people can access them.

463
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,860
Brilliant, huh?

464
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:20,980
And Jamie says, it reminds us of an old segment from Undersedation Live, the kind of show

465
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:21,980
that came before this.

466
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,380
Have anybody ever listened to Undersedation Live?

467
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,480
You need to listen or we'll shoot you.

468
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,300
There was an old segment that also included pictures submitting.

469
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,980
Oh, excellent question.

470
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:35,060
USFVB asks, what if he whips his cock out at the end of the routine?

471
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,060
Good question.

472
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,060
You want to know what?

473
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,060
What?

474
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:45,940
No offense to any of our guys listening, but I think that as far as organs go, that the

475
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,900
penis is the weirdest looking thing ever.

476
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,900
Why do you think that?

477
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,300
They just start ugly.

478
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,940
Just because they're just like there?

479
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:57,700
I don't want someone to whip out their cock on film, I'm sorry.

480
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:03,740
Well what if somebody whipped out their cock and then in an amazing yaoi fetish film another

481
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,740
guy started sucking it.

482
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,740
Would that be okay?

483
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,740
Okay.

484
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,740
Okay.

485
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,740
Oh, you hypocrite!

486
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,740
What?

487
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,740
What?

488
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,740
If you want...

489
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:22,740
Okay, so send those pictures to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

490
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,740
They have to be of you playing DDR.

491
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,740
And no nudes unless you're told that you're hot every single day.

492
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,740
And you have to have proof. Somebody has to send us an affidavit.

493
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:35,740
I am not retarded. I think that it's the strangest looking...

494
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,740
I didn't say I didn't like cock.

495
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,740
It's just funny looking.

496
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,740
I can just see it now.

497
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,740
You know, that's really weird looking.

498
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:48,740
Oh yeah, thanks. Whoa, that does it for me.

499
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,740
Oh come on, even Dan agrees with me.

500
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,740
It's like Carrot Top.

501
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,740
He's funny looking, but everybody loves Carrot Top.

502
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,740
No wait, nobody loves Carrot Top.

503
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,740
How about Yahoo Serious?

504
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,740
Yahoo Serious funny looking.

505
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,740
But everybody loves Yahoo Serious.

506
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:09,740
I like it because he's Australian. He's funny. He plays with the Tasmanian Devils.

507
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,740
It's funny Australian stuff.

508
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,740
Excellent question. What if you tell yourself you're hot every day?

509
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,740
No, it doesn't work. Sorry, dumb fly.

510
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,740
It's just like those people that tell themselves they can sing.

511
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,740
Alright, so that's something we'll look forward to doing either next week.

512
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:27,740
Probably not until next week because we'll have to upload those photos, but, you know, something you guys should do.

513
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,740
Yeah, if anyone actually sends them. I think we'll get a couple.

514
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:36,740
I'll post on the forums that we're doing it to. That's always a good way of getting people to participate.

515
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:41,740
So, moving along. What else do we have to talk about?

516
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:46,740
I don't know. I'm just not happy today.

517
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:51,740
You're just not happy today? What's up, Logan?

518
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:56,740
Ah, there's microphones coming every which way. Well, actually, in two weeks,

519
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:01,740
We're probably going to see the last, I think, of the DER Extreme Unlocks.

520
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,740
I think. I can't remember our off-hand.

521
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:10,740
I think there's thirty, well, number-wise, as far as the unlocks go, there's a total of thirty different unlocks.

522
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:16,740
I mean, even though, like, number thirty is, like, three different songs or three different whatever.

523
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,740
But there's only, like, thirty total, and we're up to twenty-four right now.

524
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:24,740
So, in two weeks, we're going to have the rest of the songs, supposedly.

525
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:29,740
So, which ought to make it very interesting because in two weeks from now is March Madness.

526
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,740
Yes, March Madness.

527
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:36,740
So, I wonder if we're going to see any last minute routines to some of these new songs.

528
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:40,740
March Madness will be broadcasting live, by the way, on Orange Lawn's radio.

529
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,740
For those of you not in NorCal or SoCal driving up here or whatever,

530
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:48,740
if you're too far away to come to the tournament in person, you can attend online.

531
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:53,740
Just visit our website and we'll be doing a live broadcast all day long, both days.

532
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:57,580
So that does mean in two weeks, the normal live program here on Orange Lounge will be

533
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,700
preempted by that coverage, so we won't be on live.

534
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,940
And chances are we're actually going to finish up over there probably around seven o'clock,

535
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,220
so there won't be a show in two weeks.

536
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,140
But we'll be here next week, of course.

537
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,140
Yeah.

538
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,340
If anyone expects me to do a fuck off afterwards, you can fuck off.

539
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:18,100
Because I'm going to be dead.

540
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:22,820
Had a tournament here last night, says Ninjosakekoi.

541
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,940
It was interesting.

542
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,100
Was that the tournament in Albany by chance?

543
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,940
Because I know there was a big one that was supposed to go on the East Coast yesterday

544
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,580
and I haven't heard anything about that.

545
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,940
I'm wondering how it went.

546
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,340
If somebody wants to tell me about how that went.

547
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,340
Certainly.

548
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,420
I'll fill you all in on that.

549
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,860
This particular tournament was in Hickory, North Carolina.

550
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,560
Cool.

551
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,700
You know, if any of you folks out there on the East Coast, other places, mid coast, basically

552
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:55,140
anywhere outside of California you want to do some tournament coverage you want

553
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,620
to maybe take a tape recorder over and talk to some people there talk to the

554
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:02,020
winners talk about the tournament put together a little bit like 10 minutes

555
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:06,300
long little package about the tournament well we'll air it here on the Orange

556
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,660
Lawns radio we put a call out a while back on live journal but nobody sent us

557
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:17,660
anything, so fuck em!

558
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:46,660
The last time I actually looked at GameFacts.com was back in April when they had Xbox.com.

559
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,660
XboxFacts.com.

560
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:58,660
Oh, the April Fools joke? I think right after that, during the summer, they did the top 64 characters of all time.

561
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:07,840
No, what I don't like is this new show on Tech TV, it's like this Microsoft-only show,

562
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:13,100
it's like all Microsoft propaganda, stupid Nazis.

563
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,100
What is it about?

564
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,100
I've never seen this.

565
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:20,920
It's like extra tips for Microsoft products and Microsoft this and Microsoft that, and

566
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:27,040
it's all about Microsoft and how wonderful Microsoft is and how Microsoft heals the world

567
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:34,040
and what not and it sucks ass. Remember that parody they put out by the Microshaft corporation

568
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:41,120
Whimblows? Yeah. They suck. Anyways, I think what we're going to do is go to a quick break

569
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,480
and then we're going to come back and get to the FUs of the week. And it will definitely

570
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,560
be short this week because there's only three of us here in studio. There's lots of you.

571
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,400
But there's lots of you, so you can go ahead and send those FUs over to Sky via private

572
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,320
message in the channel.

573
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,320
Let's see.

574
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,200
Question, we have another Hot or Not question.

575
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,160
I only have a video of me playing Legend of Max.

576
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,160
Is that acceptable?

577
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,160
Sure.

578
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,800
Sure, but please don't email that.

579
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,040
If you could put that on the web somewhere and give us a link and email us the link,

580
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,040
that would be great.

581
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,320
Don't send us...

582
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:21,080
Or there's programs out there that take screen caps of videos that can cut a frame right

583
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,080
out of it.

584
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,080
You can use that too.

585
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:34,080
Yeah, so please don't email us video, but email us like a link to the video or take a screencap of it, because we don't want any files over like 200k or something or else our email box will fill out too damn quick!

586
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,080
Alright. What do we want to hear this break? What do you guys think?

587
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,080
Entrance.

588
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:44,080
Entrance. And we already... No, we didn't do entrance. Entrance is the one you said I should have played that we didn't do.

589
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,080
Okay?

590
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,080
Evan is the metallic 57 gray? I don't even know if I can find that one. I'll see if I can find it.

591
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:57,080
What style was Entrance on?

592
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:02,080
I think someone else might have just showed up. We had the door go. Let's see who opens up the door in a little bit.

593
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:09,080
Tengo no kis, Tengoku.

594
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,440
All right, we'll be back in a little bit. Send us your FUs please

595
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:07,080
Make me do it any way

596
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:17,080
I don't know what to do

597
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:23,080
I don't know what to do

598
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:30,080
I don't know what to do

599
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:36,080
Kishine ga takigatou gozaimasu

600
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:42,080
Kissing the heavens, kumono hanenu

601
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:50,080
Kissing the heavens, no te deii tenemori

602
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:49,080
Please

603
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:56,080
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

604
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,080
That's the coolest thing ever.

605
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,080
I haven't seen a Bjork video.

606
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,080
We can fix that after the show.

607
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,080
Oh, great. Thanks.

608
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,080
Human behavior, the one with the bear.

609
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,080
I saw the one where she's jumping around and just being stupid, though.

610
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:07,080
It's like, she's just bouncing off her couch or something like that.

611
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,080
I don't remember a Bjork video with a couch in it.

612
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,080
I don't know. We'll see.

613
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,080
Like, I know.

614
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:16,080
Okay, so, also here we have DDRholic. Say hello.

615
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,080
Say hello.

616
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:20,760
Hello, good evening everybody and always fashionably late, here I am.

617
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,280
It's alright we forgive you because we know it was a lot of partying the night, or last

618
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,280
night there was a little bit of a party.

619
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,560
No, it was so cool, it was great.

620
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,000
How late did the party go till?

621
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,600
Because we left about 3.30.

622
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,520
It probably went till about 4, 4 o'clock.

623
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,520
Yeah.

624
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,520
Okay, cool.

625
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,520
Yeah.

626
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,520
I would have stayed by 4 this morning.

627
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:46,040
I got cold because his house has no heating at the time.

628
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,040
There is a little story to this.

629
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:57,040
Oh, okay. The heater was on last night at like 100 degrees, so I went and turned it down and then I wake up this morning and somebody turned it all the way off.

630
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:05,040
It was comfortable and I turned it down to like 80 and then I wake up and it's just totally off because some stupid moron turned it off.

631
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,040
Probably one of the jerks in the back.

632
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:11,040
Yeah, because it doesn't help that the heater is in the back of the house and there's none in the front.

633
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:15,160
And you know when you're at a party, you know when you're at a real party, when like all

634
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,240
these people are showing up that you don't fucking know.

635
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,040
That was happening last night.

636
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:24,320
All these people were showing up, and what's even weirder, they know you, but you don't

637
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,320
know them.

638
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,320
Oh, that's weird.

639
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,320
I took a nap.

640
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,320
Sorry.

641
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,320
Oh, no problem.

642
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:32,720
I think most everybody took a nap at some point.

643
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,560
I took like a three hour nap.

644
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:40,720
I like took over that that love seat and didn't move for a while except like to

645
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,320
wake up every so often and when I woke up I'd be fully awake and then I'd be

646
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:50,640
certainly tired again. Well like okay it was it was kind of retarded at the end

647
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:56,720
because all the kids in the back were screaming and being dumb and coming over

648
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,760
and taking the couch so none of the adults had places to sit like Shane

649
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,020
slept on the damn couch after you left so nobody could sit there and then Loki

650
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:09,220
had his spot and I had my couch and that was it and it was they were still yelling at five

651
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:17,020
o'clock in the morning those damn kids and then that was funny that call it preceded

652
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:23,580
the party from that stupid bitch oh yeah hold on okay this is like the best thing which

653
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:28,260
is actually pretty funny that Loki bitched it up okay Matt and Loki are at my house we're

654
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:33,180
We're setting up Lucky's Pads for a sim, and this girl calls.

655
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:38,340
I won't say her name, but she knows who she is because I know she's listening right now.

656
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:41,980
She calls, and she's just trying to lay these guilt trips on me, and I'm like, I want to

657
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:42,980
get off the phone right now.

658
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:45,980
And she's all, no, I don't want to let you.

659
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:50,580
Then she tells me about how some truck drove by her and threw porn at her or something.

660
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,860
That's a bad thing?

661
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,860
I want someone to throw porn at me.

662
00:51:55,860 --> 00:52:04,860
And so I'm like, okay, and then she's like starting to get mad at me so I just flat-call her a bitch on the phone like four times and they're over there laughing.

663
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:05,860
Language, now now.

664
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:06,860
I'm sorry.

665
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,860
Bitch.

666
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,860
Thank you.

667
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:15,860
Anyways, so they're over there laughing and I'm trying not to laugh and then she's, and I'm like, I just want to go.

668
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:16,860
So you get annoyed with me.

669
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:19,860
I said, I want to go because I'm about to have a party and I need to get ready for it.

670
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,860
So you can hang up anytime.

671
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:22,860
And I said, oh, I can?

672
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,860
And I just hung the phone up.

673
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:30,220
That sounds worthy of me.

674
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:33,940
That's interesting because it's like really mean, yet kind of humorous at the same time.

675
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:34,940
I don't know.

676
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:40,300
Also here, hiding in the corner, snacking on food, eating a lot, getting really fat.

677
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:46,180
Eating a lot, getting really fat, of course, well, I have some catching up to do with that.

678
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:48,580
Say hello to the ice queen, cold as always.

679
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,580
That's right.

680
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,500
Or as I should say, frigid as always.

681
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,500
Well, that too.

682
00:52:52,500 --> 00:53:01,500
Of course, you know, it's odd though because I don't really seem to remember much about last night except getting home at like 5 o'clock in the morning. Go figure that.

683
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:06,500
He picked up a prostitute on the way home.

684
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:12,500
I was very interested in driving while I was asleep.

685
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:19,500
So, we're going to catch you guys. Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead for your shot.

686
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:26,100
We're going to catch you guys up on what you missed so far.

687
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,180
There's not a whole lot of Bahmani news this week, so we don't have a lot to talk about,

688
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,180
surprise, surprise.

689
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:34,000
However, it did come out in the news that Jerry Halliwell, who did It's Raining Men

690
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,420
from Max 2, admitted she had a lesbian fling.

691
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,420
Ooh.

692
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:46,740
It's Raining Boobs and the ever-important Dancing Sage Megamix coming out for the PS2.

693
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,740
This, The Cure.

694
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:39,740
Joe, by the way, we have to offer a word to our sponsors.

695
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:53,740
This episode of Orange Jones Radio is brought to you by Propel, by Pizzeria Pretzel Combos, and the El Sebroso Guata Chip, Guacamole Chips.

696
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:56,740
They're tortilla chips with guacamole already in them.

697
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:58,740
They're chips that are the color of boogers.

698
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:02,740
For those of you... What did you say? Loki made it funny.

699
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,740
It's the guacamole-dilt chip.

700
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:09,740
For those of you too lazy to dip your chips, that's amazing. Only in America.

701
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,740
We will play Gamelan a couple in a little while.

702
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:16,740
Alright, let's do the FUs of the Week. You guys ready?

703
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:20,740
Alright, we got a whole bunch. Chat room sent me a whole bunch.

704
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:25,740
So, plenty of things to rant about tonight. Let's get it started.

705
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:45,740
My first recipe of the week is for what I mentioned earlier towards Sierra, Pacific Mortgage, and in particular, Shanda, who is the supervisor. Her name is Shanda Ramsey-Wallace and I don't care, I'm not a professional.

706
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:48,740
She can go burn in hell.

707
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,740
Because I had been asking for feedback.

708
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:51,740
How am I doing?

709
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,740
What do you need me to do differently?

710
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:55,740
What can I do to improve what I'm doing?

711
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,740
She's like, oh, no, you're doing fine.

712
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:59,740
No, no, no, no, no.

713
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,740
Just like that, by the way.

714
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:05,740
And then I get a call at 9 a.m. today

715
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:08,740
saying that I lost my assignment with my job.

716
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,740
And I'm going through 10 pages to see if there's anything new.

717
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,740
And the other thing about this,

718
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:18,740
I need to go to the doctor really bad, and I've needed to go for practically a year now.

719
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:27,740
And I was really, you know, counting on being made permanent this week so that I could go to the doctor and get all that crap taken care of.

720
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:36,740
But no. So, you know, I have to say this, is that what I'm going to do when I finally find out what's wrong is I'm going to send her my medical reports and I'm going to say,

721
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:50,740
You can pay for half of this. I should probably sue her for, uh, you know, for damages. And, you know, with our current court system, I'd probably win. But, um, I'm not that petty. Um, but no.

722
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,740
I like how you add that in there, but P.S. I'm not that petty.

723
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:56,740
No, I'm not petty and fake like she is.

724
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:06,740
But anyway, her office is toward the front on the opposite side where the UC Davis Medical Center is at 11000 Olson Drive in Rancho Cordova.

725
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:12,740
It's upstairs on the right side of the building, and her office is the window office.

726
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:14,740
She can go in there and set it on fire.

727
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:22,740
Although I am intentional making a bunch of those very bot-speed, like her vomit flavor, and dirt, and sardine, on her desk.

728
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,740
I am going at five in the morning to pick up my stuff.

729
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:29,740
Of course she's there, so that I don't have to see her ugly, lying face.

730
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:30,740
But guess what?

731
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:35,740
They said the temperature apparently likes me so much they're giving me another salmon instantly.

732
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:36,740
Yay.

733
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:37,740
They're done shaking back.

734
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,740
Next?

735
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:43,740
Moving on, uh, Loki, what do you have to say?

736
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:53,900
I had some dumb bitch in front of me today, actually I don't know who it was, but it was

737
00:57:53,900 --> 00:58:00,900
some dumb bitch driving a 30 and a 45, and there was no red lights or anything, it's

738
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:04,940
not like you're slowing down for anything, you're just slowing down for the hell of it.

739
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:11,340
So I got pissed, and drove by them and flipped them off, and yelled at them and stuff because

740
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:13,340
I couldn't hear you, but it felt good.

741
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:18,340
Um, have you the stupid teenagers that were at this gandhi last night?

742
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:20,340
Um, okay, let's see.

743
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:22,340
Number one, you're a nerd.

744
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:24,340
Okay, yeah, that's acceptable, okay?

745
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,340
Number two, you're not goth.

746
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,340
Don't try to be...

747
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:31,340
I don't know what the hell they think, but what's the step of coolness?

748
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:35,340
Okay, let's see here. I'm at the bottom rung, so the next thing I gotta be is goth.

749
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:40,340
Oh, wait, um, you know, the whole goth trend, you know, that was so ten years ago.

750
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:44,560
And now you're just annoying and you look stupid and then the guy with the wannabe mohawk

751
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:51,960
I'm gonna spike up my hair in the middle and it's gonna look like shit, and I'm gonna be all coop because I yeah

752
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,920
So there's all these kids there are like wannabe punk

753
00:58:54,920 --> 00:59:00,160
which is sad because it doesn't take much to be punk, but they're not quite there yet

754
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:04,460
And then they're playing DDR, and you'd think okay these wannabe punk guys

755
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:08,300
Maybe they listen to rock maybe they're you know trying to get through the whole punk thing and that kind of thing

756
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:14,440
They start playing nori nori nori and fucking like, you know shit like that. It makes no sense

757
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,900
I'm just you're annoying and you're in my way

758
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:21,800
So then I had my turn coming up on the machine to get a coin line of all fucked up

759
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:27,640
So I have my turn this dump this dump dumbass kid comes up to me. He's like, you know, what's my turn?

760
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:32,460
I'm like, fuck you, man. I was waiting for people. I you know, I counted it and everything

761
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:36,480
Well, I don't know if I've been on here waiting here for two minutes of 15 minutes

762
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:41,480
I'm like, oh, it was my fucking turn, get out of here.

763
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,480
So, it was annoying.

764
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,480
So basically just stupid people at Scandiac because they suck.

765
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,480
Um, F you to...

766
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,480
Would you like to take a nap, by the way, because you're a stupid kid in that place with your hair.

767
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:58,480
F you to the stupid bastard that was there also last night that wanted to do some improv turning.

768
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,480
He's like, dude, let's have a turning man for people. Yeah!

769
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:17,480
I know that kid, and he used to try to hang out with me because he thought I was so cool because I played PDR, and I was teaching him little stuff, and now he thinks he likes PDR guys because they're trying to get tournament going everywhere he goes, even if he's by himself. He'll ask random people.

770
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,640
what else we've got on the list here i know there's a bunch of shit um

771
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:40,560
at the police because i don't know why it takes about eight people to you know

772
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,960
if you uh...

773
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,280
patrol the fucking like

774
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,320
greenback lane i was driving here and i thought the police cars

775
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:52,040
drive-by not take after anything

776
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:58,800
what he's doing thank you for giving out my address on there

777
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,160
I'm kidding, God.

778
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,080
I took a street.

779
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,480
What the hell, man?

780
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,720
Fucking A, dude. It's stupid.

781
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,120
Yeah, so, so they're just...

782
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:15,120
I don't understand, they're like complaining, we don't have enough money to, you know, support our police force, and it's understaffed, and...

783
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:21,440
What the fuck? You have like eight people traveling around here, you know, pulling over speeders in a traffic area.

784
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,940
You're not gonna speed up those cars in front of you, you dumbasses.

785
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:28,780
want to do something important like stop robberies or drive-by punchings or

786
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:30,780
something like that

787
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:32,060
something like

788
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,160

789
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,780

809
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:45,740
I took the feet off the bottom of these things so they wouldn't bend and they still fucking bend

813
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:59,660
but now these are just really fucked up so

814
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:04,100
yet don't buy safer game pads if you're going to buy my mind by anyone else is

815
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:08,580
not there

816
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:11,940
uh... a quick question in the chat room wonder what someone would like trying to

817
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:14,580
play d r when they're really really drunk

818
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:18,460
last time i was in vegas i did that a circus circus i got really fucked up at

819
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:22,380
the star trek experience

820
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:25,200
which i know it's like the nerdiest thing i've ever said on the show but i

821
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,660
swear to god it's true

822
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:29,900
i got drunk at the star trek experience then walked back

823
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,380
to the circus circus

824
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,380
and then played uh...

825
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:34,900
played afro-nova

826
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:38,260
afro-nova trick i remember the song even though which is amazing is there no

827
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:38,980
struck

828
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:41,960
i played afro-nova trek on the machine that's right in the middle of like the

829
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,260
little kid area

830
01:03:43,260 --> 01:04:02,260
No, I realized when I was in Reno and I was at the Atlantis and I played their Max 2 machine. I play better when I'm drunk than when I'm not drunk.

831
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:14,260
I was, uh, I was, it was the DDR Freak Moderator strip. Me, an iguana girl, an islander. All three of us and two of my friends were there who lived in Las Vegas.

832
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:23,260
At the Star Trek experience, between the three of us, we had three warp core breaches. And, uh, no, two and a half. Two and a half.

833
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:40,260
And we went on the ride, went on the ride again, and then we took a cab over to Circus Circus and played on the USA machine that was up there with the broken, I mean broken arrows on the left side, I'm sorry, on the right side, and I was trying to do love to me.

834
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:45,260
And then, like, we called, um, Understanding Live, the voicemail, because we were drunk.

835
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:48,260
And, um, one more after you, just remember it again.

836
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:51,260
Fuck you to the stupid DDR stream roulette.

837
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:57,260
Seven times yesterday, I got one away from the Legend of Max, and it wouldn't fucking give it to me.

838
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:01,260
I've got the timing down perfect, yet you won't give it to me.

839
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:04,260
Why even fucking have it in the roulette if you're not gonna give it to me?

840
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:08,260
You stupid assholes, I can't wait two weeks to play this damn song.

841
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:10,260
I wanna play it now!

842
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:17,240
I wouldn't play roulette so you know I can get cutie chaser five times for freaking white lovers or whatever the fuck that stupid

843
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,240
Song is it sucks ass

844
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,280
Shouldn't be in there

845
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,720
Tell us what you really think logy. Oh

846
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,040
Yeah, cutie chaser morning mix. Why did they take anything from OHA?

847
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:34,200
You know DDR. It's just dumb, but did you say Omaha DDR? Oh, hi dumbass

848
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:43,200
That's not Omaha. I swear to God, I thought you said Omaha. I'm like, hey, we got friends there.

849
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:49,200
Yeah, do you know of a DDR Omaha mix? Do you know of one? Because, you know, I'm...

850
01:05:49,200 --> 01:06:00,200
That's what I thought you said, and I'm like, in my mind, I'm like, God Loki's a retard. There's no Omaha mix.

851
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:06,200
Rob's still drunk in his head, like, Rob's still drunk. I'm taking over.

852
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,200
No, Rob's too drunk to be over her host.

853
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:13,200
No, I'm, uh, I'm not doing my FUs yet, lady.

854
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,200
If you even think about it, I can hear you.

855
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:24,200
Also, um, I forgot to finish that story. When you play DDR drunk, it's like, every time you jump, I remember,

856
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:37,720
I remember you jump up and it's like, I'm flying and then you come down like a rock.

857
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:39,120
That's how it's different when you're drunk.

858
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,120
That's all I remember.

859
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:46,160
When I do this, I always spin on them and I get really dizzy.

860
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,480
I played drunk on your old pads.

861
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,360
I would also like to give a nephew the lack of sex.

862
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,360
Thank you.

863
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:57,360
by the way, I played drunk on my pads and he fell over and that was funny.

864
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:02,360
Alright, let's get to the rest of the room, shall we?

865
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,360
Who's first?

866
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,360
Who else is first?

867
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,360
You're first, go.

868
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:13,360
Okay, a couple of FUs, one of them is to these guac-a-chips because they taste like guac-a-shit.

869
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:18,360
I don't care if anybody else likes them, I think they taste like crap.

870
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:25,360
Combos are fucking good. Eat one! Okay, eat like eight, okay?

871
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:31,360
No, anyways, another F.U. I have is, of course, to the little punk, wannabe punk brigade over at Scandia.

872
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:35,360
They're stupid and annoying. They don't know what the hell a coin system is.

873
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:39,360
And they think they're really cool because they can pass, like, exotic ethnic on light.

874
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:43,360
Are you trying to get Legend of Max on roulette?

875
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,360
No, not at all.

876
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:53,360
And yeah, especially that little mohawk kid comes up to me four fucking times after I tell him every new time.

877
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,360
So how does a token line work?

878
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,360
I'm like, just put your damn token up.

879
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:01,360
And the fourth time, I just walked off. I didn't even say anything.

880
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:05,360
Whose tokens are those? Because I want to take them.

881
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:08,360
And I just said there were some guys who didn't take them.

882
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:13,360
Another F.U. I have is to, we'll call them drunk kids.

883
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:19,360
last night. I've already seen kids are trying to get drunk and stupid and I'm going to kill

884
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:26,360
them whenever I find them. And another one is those fucking pads because they should

885
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:33,360
be registered as lethal weapons. I moved the fucking pad twice and I got cut four times

886
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:38,360
because the sheet metal is so sharp on the side. I was sitting there on the pad and all

887
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:42,360
of a sudden I just noticed I was bleeding off my hands for no reason. Not to mention

888
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:47,360
Not to mention that, but the fact that the pads are bent in half, that the one side doesn't really work too well.

889
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:52,360
It got bent in half just from one game of playing on them.

890
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:59,360
And then that and the fact that the wires are coming out, and yeah, that's up.

891
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:07,360
And one last one is to Bel Air for having fucking two things left of the Sharanov Triple Black,

892
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:13,360
And one of them is missing a fucking bottle, and so we can only get one and have to resort to, like, substituting.

893
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,360
That was the worst thing ever.

894
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:18,360
And that's all, because I don't want to talk no more.

895
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,360
Next.

896
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,360
Okay, it's my turn.

897
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:27,360
Uh, first, hi DarkSessia, thanks for saying hello.

898
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:30,360
Uh, hi Irene, how are you? Are you out there?

899
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,360
Not angsty enough.

900
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:38,360
Okay, my fuck yous aren't that great, but here we go.

901
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:41,360
Well, yeah, okay, we'll start with that.

902
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:46,360
Fuck yous to Laundromat, because going to Laundromat is not fun.

903
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:51,360
Today was my first experience in years to go to a Laundromat, and it wasn't too bad.

904
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:57,360
I was in a hurry, though, so it just kind of sucks having to share your laundry with the whole world.

905
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,360
So anyway, back to other things.

906
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,360
Uh, fuck you to my computer.

907
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,360
It's not working properly.

908
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:07,360
I can't get it to work hardly at all.

909
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,360
Oh, yeah, okay, thanks to me.

910
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,360
I did my good deed for the week.

911
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:19,360
I gave 0x my extra 32 megabytes of RAM for this computer,

912
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:23,360
which only had 32 megabytes of RAM,

913
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,360
so I gave him an extra one, and now it has 64 megabytes of RAM,

914
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,360
and now it works nicely.

915
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:31,860
So, that's my good deed for the week.

916
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:34,860
I know, it was like, yeah, it was extra.

917
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:37,360
What's that?

918
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,860
You have 512 megabytes of RAM.

919
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,360
512 of my old computer.

920
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,860
My current one's like 80-something DDR RAM now.

921
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,860
Whoa, that's nice.

922
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:49,360
This is how it came.

923
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,860
Yeah.

924
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:53,860
Well, yeah, right now my computer is not functioning,

925
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:56,360
and I think there's a virus on it, and I can't tell,

926
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:59,360
I can't get online yet, but I don't know, I'll have to figure it out.

927
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,360
Your computer has never had a virus scanner?

928
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,360
Yeah, I think I got something stupid on there, but I'll have to figure it out.

929
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:19,360
Anyway, and fuck you to the Kmart on Stockton Avenue, because they have... Stockton Boulevard, excuse me.

930
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:26,360
There are people that work there that really suck. They can't do anything, and they never have enough people at the cash register.

931
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,360
It's a Kmart.

932
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:33,360
Yes, I know. It's a Kmart. It's going downhill fast.

933
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:44,360
And fuck you to guys, and I won't say why. I just hate guys. You know, guys suck. Sorry to all you guys out there who are decent guys.

934
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:48,360
But guys who really suck, fuck you.

935
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:51,360
And yeah, fuck you to lack of sex.

936
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:54,360
Guys who suck, here's my number.

937
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:59,360
And I'm done. Let's see your fucking math.

938
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:03,360
I have to agree with Rob, fuck you to lack of sex.

939
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:09,360
It's been so long I don't even remember what a penis looks like, except my own.

940
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:15,360
Oh, great, that's lovely. Thank you.

941
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:26,360
Also, I have to back up Jamie's fuck you to her boss, because bosses everywhere suck, and they should all be frickin' tarred and feathered and thrown out into a street naked.

942
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:36,360
Well, with the exception of Lokai's boss, because I guess Lokai's boss is wrong, but other than that, fuck not having a computer and fuck not having...

943
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,360
Well, actually, fuck having a job, period.

944
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,360
Having to have a job to make money.

945
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,360
And that's about it this week.

946
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:52,360
You say fuck having a job. Can I say fuck not having a job?

947
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:55,360
I should rephrase that. Fuck having to have a job to have money.

948
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,360
Or say fuck having your job.

949
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,360
Well, that too. That works.

950
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,360
People need to pay me because I'm cool.

951
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:05,360
Pay me for the privilege of being in my presence.

952
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:09,440
I'm just going to become a porn star. You know why? Because you're getting paid to have

953
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:14,200
sex. That's two of my big problems right there.

954
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:24,200
I don't want to go buy porn to see Robin. Well, you'd see my dick on the cover, so you

955
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,760
know, you'd be all, I better stay away from this. Rob's naked on the cover.

956
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:32,080
What if you're one of the extras? And you're not on the cover.

957
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:39,080
I am much better than a fluff boi.

958
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:06,080
We're gonna start with Ninja Usagi Koe.

959
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:11,080
Our first F.U. goes to rocks in the woods that aren't fat people friendly.

960
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:15,080
The second will go to Namco for no free play. They suck.

961
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:23,080
The third will go to all politicians for being so fucking stupid and sending us to war and just ignoring other possibilities because they're so fucking power hungry.

962
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,080
Arigato ho hanemate.

963
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,080
F.U. to Freedom Fries.

964
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:04,080
what that used to be like.

965
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:04,080
people who get in Jamie's way when she drives.

966
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:36,040
I'm sorry, this is from Skyline DC-505.

967
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:41,360
Fuck you to the DMV for failing me during the drive test for a dangerous maneuver.

968
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:45,000
Stupid, stupid bitches, and fuck you to little kids in Scandia.

969
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,160
I would like to request more information on what that dangerous maneuver was.

970
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:51,040
So send that over, please.

971
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,480
Dr. Tuya says, continued F.U. to being single.

972
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:54,520
I need a date, dammit.

973
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:57,820
Fuck banging my foot on the vacuum, it freaking hurts.

974
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:03,320
And fuck the United States Postal Service, Angel Snail Mail didn't arrive yesterday.

975
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:06,140
I haven't gotten any either.

976
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:10,960
Oh, God, here comes Snub Dispenoid.

977
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,640
Okay!

978
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,340
First off, fuck drivers training once again, fuck it up the peehole.

979
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:20,140
I'm fucking sick of Red Asphalt 3 and that sick fuck that treated human beings

980
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:21,780
like they were fucking toys.

981
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:25,080
I swear to God, I don't want to hear some child-raping 40-year-old say,

982
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:29,780
Oh, what a waste, when the person's fucking brains are plastered on the freeway.

983
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:32,780
I thought it was hilarious. I was laughing my ass off during that video.

984
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:34,780
Well, you're a sick fuck.

985
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:37,780
If you ever want to see a good comedy, watch any of the Red Ass Waltz.

986
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:40,780
It's, like, better than Spike and Mike.

987
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:42,780
They're all, Oh my God, it's so horrible!

988
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:48,780
And they just show a dead person on, like, me, not a steering wheel.

989
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:49,780
True.

990
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:53,660
little kids who told the people at my table to shut up. The only person that can tell

991
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:57,700
me to shut up is the fucking teacher, not some stuck-up, cousin-humping piece of shit

992
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:02,180
that lives in Natomas. Fuck them. Also, fuck you to that stupid shitwad that thinks Judo

993
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:05,900
is kicking someone in the nuts as hard as you can and throwing their limp body over

994
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:10,260
you. That's not Judo, that's fucking mental retardation. That's ghetto Judo, man. My ball

995
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:16,540
still fucking hurts, so fuck you, buddy. And fuck you to the fucking asshole bassoon player

996
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:20,800
that left me all alone in my orchestra. I have to play all of my parts alone and I can't

997
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,880
play contrabassoon because we won't have a regular bassoon if I did.

998
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:28,520
Hey, if your band has a contrabassoon clarinet, I'll play it. I'll volunteer.

999
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,680
Fuck him right in his little bitch-ass ear. I fucking hate his worthless ass. Fucking

1000
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:37,680
shack of shit. Fuck it. Fuck it all. Fuck. Like bloody fucking hell, fuck it all.

1001
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:44,660
23rd Magus says, Fuck you to being broke. Probably can't enter March Madness. I cry.

1002
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:48,940
you to Angel being in Japan and not here in SAC. I cry again. Fuck you to my parents not

1003
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:55,060
getting me and having their heads stuck up their asses. I cries more.

1004
01:18:55,060 --> 01:19:01,420
Rice says, fuck you bad mic with buzzing. I agree. Fuck you slow, weak, move faster.

1005
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:08,020
Fuckity fuck fuck fuck, that is all. Black Lab says, more FUs. Did I even get the

1006
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:13,140
first ones? I don't remember reading Black Lab FUs. Well, he says number six. I don't

1007
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:15,140
Remember seeing one through five, but whatever

1008
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:22,520
Fuck the shitty internet connection in the dorms and fuck chipotle burritos. They're damn too. Damn good. I had them four times this week

1009
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:26,300
Like this whole chipotle trend, okay

1010
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:33,540
I like the chipotle burritos, but you know what they make me sick every time I eat them. Isn't it pronounced chipotle?

1011
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:37,060
Chipotle or something like that, okay

1012
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:41,000
Anybody seen that um that one check in the box commercial great

1013
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:48,000
D.D.R. Mike would like to say, fuck you to Concord.

1014
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Skyline says that his dangerous maneuver was that he messed up in a left turn.

1015
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:01,000
What did you do, you turned right in a left turn or something?

1016
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Or did you try to turn left from the right turn lane?

1017
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:11,000
When you turn left and you're with a driving instructor, you're not supposed to powerslide.

1018
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Yeah, I would just like to remind everybody out there that real-life driving is not like Initial D. You don't want to drift.

1019
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:28,000
You know what? Everything that I learned, it was funny the whole time I was taking JB home, I'm like, okay, what I just did, don't do that.

1020
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:35,000
that

1021
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:41,020
jonah sent us some uh... lovely a fuse

1022
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:42,340
over e-mail

1023
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:43,400
explicit

1024
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:50,400
might know by the show forces fuck you too

1025
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,480
yes definitely

1026
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:59,820
But he would like to help console himself through that by doing a little bit of venting.

1027
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:03,760
He says, F.U. to my Calc teacher, and he draws a little asky middle finger.

1028
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:07,180
She does not understand what I was going through and told me there's no chance I have to pass

1029
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:09,180
the class, so I decided to withdraw.

1030
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:10,180
I can't believe this.

1031
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:14,900
This is just sick to fail a person whose, well I guess this is what I'll say, whose

1032
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:18,340
dad just passed away and missed a midterm, so fuck her for that.

1033
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:22,820
And another F.U. to the asshole who was pissing me off so badly at a situation like this.

1034
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:26,240
Like I told him I wasn't in the mood to get pissed off that he intended to do so anyway.

1035
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:27,560
That's just disgraceful.

1036
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:31,440
As much as I want to rip his skull so bad the teacher was there and I don't want to

1037
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,440
get in trouble from the cops.

1038
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:35,880
Oh yeah, F you to the cops because they won't let me rip this asshole apart.

1039
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,480
Saying I'd be arrested.

1040
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,360
He'll be gone for a little while but not retired.

1041
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:46,560
Well you know what the whole deal with midterm is, I'm assuming that's college courses.

1042
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:53,560
take that up with the dean of that particular college and they should take care of it.

1043
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:59,360
Alright, some good advice from Jamie because Jamie knows how to kick ass and take names.

1044
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:04,060
Flak Lab, we got the other FUs. He says, Fuck my upcoming finals, they suck. Fuck legal

1045
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:08,320
battles. My girlfriend's plans to visit me during her spring break are currently fucked

1046
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:12,020
over because her aunt is in legal trouble with her business. Fuck the engineering two

1047
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:16,240
building computer labs for closing at 10pm on Friday nights. I had a project due at midnight

1048
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:21,880
that I couldn't finish because they closed early.

1049
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:25,880
Fuck flat bike tires. I got one on Friday night and on my way home from working on my

1050
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:29,540
project thus forcing me to walk a good distance in the rain and dark.

1051
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:35,260
Fuck power outages. One happened Friday night and it screwed up my computer and iPod settings.

1052
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:42,260
Oh and Skyline says he didn't see the oncoming traffic when he made the left turn.

1053
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:50,940
justin circuit wants to add FU to comcast for still not fixing my email if this next

1054
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:52,020
request doesn't fix it

1055
01:22:52,020 --> 01:23:00,260
i told you what you need to do with them you just let me call them okay i'll get your email

1056
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:03,680
back let me call them

1057
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:08,900
and last but certainly not least we have uh mennequin ego jazz for saying fuck you to

1058
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:15,900
teachers who complain about noise in the hallways. If you want quiet, close your fucking door.

1059
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:22,900
Yeah, if you don't like noise, you probably shouldn't be teaching because you're loud.

1060
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:26,060
Well, that remark about teachers not teaching, if they didn't teach, they wouldn't be able

1061
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:29,100
to do anything because you figured there are teachers because they can't make it doing

1062
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:32,140
what it is that they teach. Oh, my God. One of my high school teachers,

1063
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:39,080
She would always go, this is so chaotic, didn't you have any Christmas the whole time?

1064
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:42,360
And she would always, every time anyone would say anything, and someone in the back of the

1065
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:45,640
hall said something, she always blamed it on the front three people in the row, but

1066
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:49,160
the funniest thing happened like two years after I left.

1067
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:54,400
She left the classroom, okay, and see everyone really didn't care for her just because she

1068
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:58,800
was so nuts already, but she left the classroom to go take care of something, and when she

1069
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,800
When she got back, all the students had turned their desks around backwards.

1070
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:06,800
And if I remember correctly, they even moved her desk to the opposite side.

1071
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,800
When she came in, she had a breakdown.

1072
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,800
And apparently went on hiatus.

1073
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:15,800
No, it's funny. I've never really had any teaching experience, even though I think that'd be fun.

1074
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:20,800
But I used to do marshaling for Cuzar, which is obviously pretty much no work at all.

1075
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,800
But you have to do a little brief, which is kind of funny.

1076
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:28,800
I did one for this one girl who was losing her voice. This is after I quit working there.

1077
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:34,800
But my favorite way I entered the brief, because everyone was talking, was,

1078
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,800
Shut the fuck up!

1079
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,800
And then everyone was like, Huh? What?

1080
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:42,800
And then I did my brief, yelling at them.

1081
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,800
It was cool because I couldn't get fired because I never worked.

1082
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:51,800
The best teacher thing I ever did was when I was in eighth grade.

1083
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:56,800
You knew she was a big drug, you could only tell because she would eat sunflower seeds

1084
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:00,480
in class and then just fall asleep.

1085
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:05,440
One time we made a big old packaging tape, we made a big ball out of it, threw it at

1086
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:08,360
the chalkboard right behind her head.

1087
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:12,160
She jumped like 10 feet and my friend and I personally made it our mission to get her

1088
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:15,480
out of the class and we drove her to rehab.

1089
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:19,960
We drove her nuts and we found her drug buddy one day in class and that was all the evidence

1090
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:20,960
we needed.

1091
01:25:50,960 --> 01:26:02,960
This one, I don't know what prompted me to do this, but some girl in 4th grade that I used to talk to, I would only talk to her, no one else, I'd talk to her with a fake Spanish accent.

1092
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:07,960
And then at the very last day of the year I'd talk to her and she'd be like, what happened to your voice? What are you talking about?

1093
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:09,960
It was hilarious.

1094
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:12,960
That's so stupid.

1095
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:19,960
the

1096
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:24,000
you're telling me about this yesterday back in late sixth grade when i was like

1097
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,280
parent even

1098
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,920
he was sixth grade

1099
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:29,960
are very late it was like after they built this one is going to raise the

1100
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:31,880
risk of being like bright

1101
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:36,120
neon like god-awful i don't even know what was on them

1102
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:37,080
sixties

1103
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:41,560
and things they're almost like empty air pants with his role i kind of like

1104
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:45,040
Silk, so they weren't like silk or anything, but I used to wear those all the time

1105
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:48,760
I think they were like the coolest thing and I used to be awesome at German dodgeball

1106
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:53,440
I was just like yeah, look at me in my pants

1107
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:57,840
I remember

1108
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:00,720
In 11th grade I took advanced English

1109
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:06,240
And I laid my, I would sleep all day in my classes and my teacher wouldn't care

1110
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:12,320
there, because I would always pass my tests, and I never read the book. I just happened

1111
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:18,760
to retain everything that she said in class while I was asleep. Proof that the subliminal

1112
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:24,200
learning tapes might actually have worked. Of course, I could learn in my sleep, and

1113
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:30,360
again high school is a joke. In Spanish class, when we'd watch a movie, we'd steal the tests

1114
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:33,520
for the next two or three months, and we stole midterm and sold it at the beginning of the

1115
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:40,080
In chemistry class, I took the later afternoon chemistry class, and we would go whenever

1116
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:43,640
we had substitute teachers and were left busy work to do, you know, just those forms fill

1117
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:44,640
out.

1118
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:50,600
We would go into the assignment box, because we would have to, we had this little stack

1119
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:54,780
of inboxes that we would put in our papers, we would take the early, the morning class

1120
01:27:54,780 --> 01:28:00,020
as papers, and take the person who we know always got the answer right, and copy off

1121
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:12,700
The only thing I can remember from high school that was funny was one time, this is a very

1122
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:19,700
short story, I was in class, I was in ROTC in high school and my best friend Becky, she

1123
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:24,100
gave me, she was like, come here Anita, come here, come here, let me show you something.

1124
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:28,300
She had a Playgirl magazine.

1125
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:32,140
So we were looking at this in class and we were both sat in the back of the classroom

1126
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:35,860
and we were all giggling and everything and checking it out and one of the other girls

1127
01:28:35,860 --> 01:28:38,020
that was sitting in front of me, she was like, what are you guys doing?

1128
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:41,620
She's all checking it out and she saw me and she was like, ooh, I'm going to tell, I'm

1129
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:42,620
going to tell, I'm going to tell.

1130
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:45,660
And we started making those big ruckus because I was trying so hard not to get caught because

1131
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:49,040
I was one of those kids that never got in trouble.

1132
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:53,580
And here I am with a Playgirl magazine in ROTC class.

1133
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:55,700
Well luckily our teacher...

1134
01:28:55,700 --> 01:28:56,980
What grade was this again?

1135
01:28:56,980 --> 01:28:58,980
This was like, I was a sophomore in high school.

1136
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:00,980
I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna tell him.

1137
01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:03,980
Dude, that bitch should have fucking gotten slapped aside.

1138
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:07,980
I'm gonna tell him, cause I'm the teacher's pet 911.

1139
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:10,980
I want to be the teacher's best friend.

1140
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:14,980
And if she would ask me, I would sleep with her.

1141
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:19,980
Oh my god, I don't know if it was quite like that, but she was just acting up.

1142
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:24,980
If she bent over to kiss my ass, I would be sold there.

1143
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:37,980
Well, anyway, what happened was nothing. I didn't get caught. The teacher came close to check him what was going on, but he looked, and I think he realized what was going on, and he was like, I don't want to go there, and he just walked away.

1144
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:42,980
He walked up to the girl and was like, let me tell him, let me tell him!

1145
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:46,980
I used to read comic books and geometry.

1146
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:54,220
I have a story about a geometry teacher, and I have a picture of him actually with me,

1147
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:55,220
not here with me.

1148
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:57,220
I should guess they're in the car, I can't find them.

1149
01:29:57,220 --> 01:30:01,700
My teacher looked like a treasure troll with no hair.

1150
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:04,780
What color was the hair?

1151
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:05,780
Oh, no hair.

1152
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:07,980
Well, he had, you know, he was bald on top.

1153
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:09,820
Well, how do you look like a treasure troll?

1154
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:12,060
He had the face of a treasure troll.

1155
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:13,060
Same shape.

1156
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:14,060
And the other class called him Jolly.

1157
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:15,060
Jolly?

1158
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:16,060
No, his name was Mr. Jolly.

1159
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:20,060
The other classes either called him Dolly or they called him Elmer.

1160
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:22,060
Like Elmer Fudd.

1161
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:25,060
That was the one but ugly man.

1162
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:30,580
But I would just read comic books because I didn't care.

1163
01:30:30,580 --> 01:30:35,240
And then there was the one time in class where, to confuse him, I asked him, can you truly

1164
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:40,440
square infinity because any number, the only numbers that you can multiply, you've said

1165
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:43,660
this yourself, it's a proven mathematical fact that the only numbers that you can square

1166
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:47,420
and have them equal themselves are one and zero.

1167
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:48,220
Right?

1168
01:30:48,220 --> 01:30:49,140
Right.

1169
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:51,740
Well, you can't square infinity, because if the only two

1170
01:30:51,740 --> 01:30:55,420
things that can equal themselves are zero and one,

1171
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:57,940
infinity squared cannot equal infinity.

1172
01:30:57,940 --> 01:31:00,900
That just disproves that, though, because infinity is not

1173
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:01,820
even a number, though.

1174
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:03,780
So I guess it doesn't disprove anything.

1175
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:05,700
It's not a number.

1176
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:06,500
It's an idea.

1177
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:07,180
Exactly.

1178
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:09,300
But I was using it in mathematical terms,

1179
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:10,920
and he was like, oh, of course you can.

1180
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:25,160
I feel like I'm in school right now.

1181
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:28,240
Can we stop?

1182
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:29,240
Okay we can stop.

1183
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:31,520
I was a little brat.

1184
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:37,680
Okay then we're school.

1185
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:40,680
We're going to take a quick break and then we're going to come back and I think we want

1186
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:41,680
You are listless when we come back for the break?

1187
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:42,680
Sure.

1188
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:43,680
Okay.

1189
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:44,680
Tonight's listless.

1190
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:46,320
So, who wants to participate tonight?

1191
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:47,320
Okay.

1192
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:48,320
Oh, everybody?

1193
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:49,320
Six?

1194
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:50,320
We could do it.

1195
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,320
Yeah.

1196
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,320
Okay.

1197
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:53,320
But this is the interesting thing.

1198
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:54,320
Okay, the list tonight.

1199
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,920
Top three things that Konami needs to apologize for.

1200
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:58,280
Okay.

1201
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:03,280
So think about that during the break, and we'll be back.

1202
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:10,280
alright

1203
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:51,280
Come on, shake your body, baby, do the come down, no You can't control yourself any longer

1204
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:10,280
Everybody makes a deal that comes out Don't you pick a choice that's in it

1205
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:12,280
All you're building up are the music getting stronger

1206
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:14,280
Don't you fight it, please, let the deal that comes out

1207
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:30,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1208
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:37,280
Everybody gather round now, let your body feel the heat

1209
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:45,280
Don't you worry if you can't dance, let the music move your feet

1210
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:53,280
Put the bread down on the island, and like sugar cane so sweet

1211
01:34:53,280 --> 01:35:01,860
But if you want to do the contest, you've got to listen to the beat

1212
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:03,680
Come you, shake your body, baby, do the combo

1213
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,560
No hit the charges, can you come along?

1214
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:07,600
Come on, shake your body, baby, do the combo

1215
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,620
No hit the charges, can you come along?

1216
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:11,460
Come you, shake your body, baby, do the gunfire

1217
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:13,320
No hit the charges, can you come along?

1218
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:17,920
Come on, shake your body, baby, do the combo

1219
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:51,920
We are what we're supposed to be

1220
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,920
Illusions of our capacity

1221
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:57,920
Out of the light you speak and face

1222
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:00,920
What you do is what you wish to do

1223
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:02,920
We are the god of symphony

1224
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:05,920
We do the things you want to see

1225
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:08,920
Bring my friends to the extreme

1226
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:11,920
Our friends are so unreasonable

1227
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:14,920
They do the unpredictable

1228
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:17,520
I don't like to speak and say

1229
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,720
What we do is what you wish to do

1230
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:23,320
That's all I know, that's my friend

1231
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:25,720
Going on a little bit

1232
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:28,520
Bring my friend to the extreme

1233
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:31,520
One by one, we're making it fun

1234
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:34,320
We are the actual heroes of the world

1235
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:37,120
We are the ones who've gone there forever

1236
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,320
You say bye-bye, crazy-bye

1237
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:42,720
Oh, the ones that'll never be forever

1238
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:48,220
You can fly fast, or I can hold your hand We're going to go to the party

1239
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:53,720
We're going to the party We're going to go to the party

1240
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:10,720
That's a long way to go, huh?

1241
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:15,720
I know, but I'm afraid I'll be going.

1242
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:19,720
into the dark black forest.

1243
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:44,920
Into the dark black forest.

1244
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:51,920
easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

1245
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:21,360
So, you just want to duplicate something because you really believe it's true, then fine, do

1246
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,360
it.

1247
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:25,760
With all due respect to Konami, because of course the show wouldn't exist without DDR,

1248
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,760
but you know, there are a few things they could fix.

1249
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:28,760
I would find another reason.

1250
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:29,760
There are a few things they could fix.

1251
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:32,760
If it was not for Paraparaparadise.

1252
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:35,520
Alright, go for it, Jamie, you want to start?

1253
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:40,400
Oh, let me, I'm sorry, I have to bring up the list, my word document where I can actually

1254
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,280
make lists here.

1255
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:45,780
I noticed how I've never erased that Erotic one, because that was the greatest one we ever did.

1256
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:47,780
Alright, Jamie, your number three pick.

1257
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:51,780
They have not done any more Super Konami World games.

1258
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:57,780
Super Konami World, they had done two of them on the Nintendo.

1259
01:39:57,780 --> 01:40:01,780
And you could, like, play as Boy or Girl and go to the Castlevania universe,

1260
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:07,280
and then go to the Gradius universe, and then it's like a bunch of Konami games in one, and it was neat.

1261
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:09,780
And they haven't done any since.

1262
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:11,780
We need more Super Konami World!

1263
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:46,780
One I just put basically was shitty steps for hella good songs on Xtreme.

1264
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:53,780
Sink steps suck, Frozen Ray sucks, V sucks.

1265
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:57,780
I mean, the list could just go on. Colors sucks.

1266
01:40:57,780 --> 01:41:01,780
I mean, I'd even need to say more about that.

1267
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:03,780
shitty steps for good songs on Xtreme.

1268
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:38,780
They should have had... I think it sucked that they didn't have any Korean songs on there, because that was what made...

1269
01:41:38,780 --> 01:41:45,780
Yeah, well, I know. That made the first, second, and third mixes fast, though, I thought.

1270
01:41:45,780 --> 01:41:47,780
They didn't? Whoops.

1271
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:49,780
Maybe the first ones you played or something.

1272
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:56,780
Yeah. Okay. Well, I just like Korean songs. Okay, thanks.

1273
01:41:56,780 --> 01:41:57,780
Okay, Ice Queen.

1274
01:41:57,780 --> 01:42:00,780
I'd say they need to apologize for not making any more keyboard mania.

1275
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:26,300
The number three thing they should apologize for, you know I actually had DDRPC on my list,

1276
01:42:26,300 --> 01:42:32,800
So I'm going to say the number three thing that Konami should apologize for, and I apologize

1277
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:35,740
in advance to some folks in our chat room because they're really going to hate me for

1278
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:38,840
saying this, but they need to apologize for the whistle song.

1279
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:41,800
Yes, that song fucking sucks.

1280
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:45,880
And I know there's fans of it in the chat room, but you need to understand, I had no

1281
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:53,360
problem with the song until other people ruined it for me by like chanting along to it and

1282
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:59,520
all that stuff it's now ruined and now it needs to be apologized for so all

1283
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:07,560
right my number two pick is they should apologize for the bad voice acting in

1284
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:10,920
Castlevania Symphony of the night

1285
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:18,160
they came had atrocious voice acting in comparison to the Japanese version it

1286
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:22,160
It was not by my hand that I was once again given flesh.

1287
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:26,160
Die, monster! You don't belong in this world!

1288
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:31,160
Oh yeah? Well die, Richter voice actor! You don't belong in this game! Ha ha!

1289
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:34,160
Alright. Loki, your number two pick.

1290
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:40,160
Um, let's see. I would have to say they need to apologize.

1291
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:45,160
This should almost be a number one, but they need to apologize for B4U.

1292
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:53,160
I hate the group. I hate the group B4U that can all die, okay? All of them.

1293
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:57,160
Jamie had that written as her number one, now she's thinking.

1294
01:43:57,160 --> 01:44:01,160
All right.

1295
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:03,160
Your number two pick, zero.

1296
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:06,160
Um, basically fucking over the U.S.

1297
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:10,160
When it comes to any DDR releases, or pretty much any Beemani releases,

1298
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:13,160
we get, like, the total shit end of the stick.

1299
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:20,160
The Japanese one was good but the US one was totally just raped.

1300
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:50,160
They know they have the following here now, so why don't they do something about it instead of keep screwing us over?

1301
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:52,160
Okay.

1302
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:55,160
Oh, I guess it's my turn. Okay.

1303
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:57,160
Let's see, where am I here?

1304
01:44:57,160 --> 01:45:07,160
Oh, I think we should apologize for not making more mixes of Para Para Paradise arcade game.

1305
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:14,000
I mean, I know Para Para Para itself kind of died in Japan, but shoot, you know, it's

1306
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
one game, huh?

1307
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Yeah.

1308
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Was it?

1309
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Really?

1310
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Is it getting big here?

1311
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:25,240
The Para Para craze is actually starting to pick up here a few places, like about places.

1312
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:27,760
Like in the dance clubs kind of thing?

1313
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:31,680
Well, they've had Para Para All Stars Touring in the US.

1314
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:32,680
You're kidding me.

1315
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:37,680
At the Anime Expo, they had them giving out flyers and doing instructions at Anime Expo last year.

1316
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:40,680
That's fly! Awesome.

1317
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:44,680
Don't go to Anime Expo, by the way, because it's the worst convention ever.

1318
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:47,680
So, yeah.

1319
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:50,680
Well, more Para-Para, please.

1320
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:53,680
Anyway, I'll pass the microphone.

1321
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:54,680
Yes.

1322
01:45:54,680 --> 01:46:02,680
Okay, Konami really needs to apologize, and this is kind of an addition to Zero's earlier statement.

1323
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:06,680
Just, they need to apologize for Konami USA, period.

1324
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:10,680
I'm just, I'm elaborating on his, that was my original idea.

1325
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:16,680
Konami America is just, I'm sorry, it is just not limited to Konami.

1326
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:22,680
Everything they made in Japan that has been transferred over to the US through Konami USA

1327
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:28,680
Sucks! They raped it up the ass and started punching it. What is that, donkey punching?

1328
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:35,680
Yeah. I'm like, I'm sorry, but that's just it. Period. Next.

1329
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:47,680
Alright, my number two pick that Konami needs to apologize for. I would say Castlevania 64.

1330
01:46:47,680 --> 01:47:02,680
When I first started playing that game, I thought it almost started off as a good game and then like halfway through the first level I was like ehh.

1331
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:15,680
They need to apologize for the Super Nintendo version of Dracula X because I have the PC Engine version.

1332
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:37,680
And you know what? Where I actually really like the Super Nintendo one, if ever you've played the PC Engine version, then that's like, where the PC Engine version is like eating a feast, the SNES version is like vomit. So, yeah.

1333
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:40,680
So Dracula V gets a...

1334
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:41,680
Five!

1335
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:43,680
Isn't that what they called it here?

1336
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:44,680
No, it was Dracula X on the Super Nintendo.

1337
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:48,680
I thought they called it Dracula V. Or Castlevania V or something.

1338
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:49,680
No, it's Dracula X.

1339
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:50,680
Oh, okay. My bad. My bad.

1340
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:54,680
So it's actually cool because, you know, actually Symphony of the Night was Dracula X2.

1341
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:56,680
All right.

1342
01:47:56,680 --> 01:48:00,680
So you're Loki. I'm sorry. Loki's number one pick.

1343
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:03,680
Okay.

1344
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:07,680
Um, they need to apologize.

1345
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:10,680
Propolitary.

1346
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:29,680
Because, uh, you know what, she wouldn't have a career if it weren't for DDR, and I would hope that she wouldn't have a career if it weren't for DDR, and, you know, I wish she would just go, you know what, uh, yeah, we were hoping that you would get better, you never did, so bye.

1347
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:32,680
Zero, your number one pick?

1348
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:01,680
All right.

1349
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:03,680
Anita.

1350
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:06,680
I have a question, Zero. How come you named your cat, Naoki, then?

1351
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:08,680
Ha ha ha! Touché!

1352
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:13,680
Because I was actually drunk when I named my cat.

1353
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:16,680
And I just got too lazy trying to think of something else.

1354
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:19,680
And my cat makes the name Naoki sound cool.

1355
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:23,680
Well, your cat was also answering to Nao-chan, too.

1356
01:49:23,680 --> 01:49:28,760
Anita, you're number one.

1357
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:31,880
Okay, my number one. They should apologize for

1358
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:36,200
let them move!

1359
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:40,440
Excellent suggestion.

1360
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:44,040
Matt, or Ice Queen, your number one pick. They need to apologize.

1361
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:47,240
Oh yes, yes.

1362
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:52,640
Is that your answer or what do you want to say? You know what, I had something in mind, but I'm going to change it to Loki's.

1363
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:55,640
Bag. Period.

1364
01:49:55,640 --> 01:50:00,640
Who wants to hear a freakin' bagpipe screeching as loud as you can get it?

1365
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:05,640
Oh my god, Jamie. Oh my god. No comment.

1366
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:08,640
They really need to apologize for that.

1367
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:13,640
Okay, very controversial topic in the chat where we have a lot of people arguing with this. This is interesting.

1368
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:17,640
Alright, but my number one, and I'm surprised nobody's said this yet,

1369
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:47,600
No New Super Konami World Games, DDRPC, Shitty Steps for Good Songs on Extreme, Not Making DDR USA Arcade Better, Discontinuing Keyboard Mania, The Whistle Song, Bad Voice Act 2 in Castlevania 2 The Night,

1370
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:52,600
fucking over the U.S. No new Parpar games, konami USA,

1371
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:56,600
Castlevania 64, SNES version of Dracula X,

1372
01:50:56,600 --> 01:51:01,600
Politary, Naoki and his 150 aliases. Let them move, bag, and new logo.

1373
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:07,600
Probably Naoki.

1374
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:15,600
Because before I had heard many tac things, I really liked Naoki's mixes.

1375
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:22,600
Remember, I was a big fan of Brilliant To You O.D. That was my favorite song ever.

1376
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:27,040
I would agree to some extent because some of the Naoki aliases are bad, like Naoki

1377
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:34,040
featuring Politary and Naoki NMR, like Let Them Move and stuff, those are bad, but Naoki

1378
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:39,080
Underground who did Insertion, that's pretty cool. Although I do agree he needs to get

1379
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:46,880
over the identity crisis okay uh next yeah loki what are you taking off um i'm gonna

1380
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:51,600
take off not making ddr usa arcade better because you know what i just don't care if

1381
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:54,760
that machine doesn't exist to me anymore so whatever

1382
01:51:54,760 --> 01:52:02,200
you know the other i almost took off that one but for one reason it sort of opened the

1383
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:08,200
door for all the new stuff we're getting now, so, yeah.

1384
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:14,800
It's red and has Konami on it. It's okay. Okay. Zero, what's coming off the list?

1385
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:19,800
Even though I totally agree, I would say let them move. Take that off. Even though I, I

1386
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:24,800
mean, I absolutely agree with it because it's horrible, but the other ones are better.

1387
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:28,800
The song sucks.

1388
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:32,800
Anita.

1389
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:34,800
Uh...

1390
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:37,800
Jeez. Where does the list begin?

1391
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:39,800
I'm sorry. It starts with...

1392
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:41,800
Ladies Night to Get Out was from a couple weeks ago.

1393
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:43,800
It starts here. There we go.

1394
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:45,800
Okay. Um...

1395
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:48,800
Ah, gosh.

1396
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:52,800
Alright, I'll just say shitty steps for a good song sitting straight.

1397
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,800
Okay.

1398
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:59,800
Yes, exactly. That is the reason I am attacking Zero.

1399
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:09,800
I don't know, I just think you have a very good point, but it just doesn't seem like as much of a bitch as the rest of the stuff.

1400
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:12,800
Alright.

1401
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:15,800
Decision's final. Matt, what comes off the list?

1402
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:20,800
I'll have to take off the new logo just because, you know, there's so many other things on there that are so much better.

1403
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:24,800
It sucks, but it's lesser of evil.

1404
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:30,800
I'm going to get slapped for this, but it's so bad that it's good.

1405
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:33,800
I'm taking off the bad voice acting in Castlevania 6 days at night.

1406
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:35,800
No!

1407
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:41,800
Because, you know what, it's one of those things where it's like, I love mimicking it.

1408
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:44,800
Die, monster! You don't belong in this world!

1409
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:48,800
And I mean, it's so bad that I love to mimic it, so for that it's redeemable.

1410
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:55,800
and it said true of all religions. Dan and I used to quote that game.

1411
01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:00,880
And I'm not doing that because Brad is jumping in the chatroom up and down asking me to,

1412
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:07,880
but I really do think that it's so bad it's good, so there you go.

1413
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:15,720
Alright, so I have to close out all the windows first before I can start taking votes here.

1414
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:20,720
Somebody had suggested, because of no new remixes by the T-word...

1415
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:23,720
What were some of the suggestions? I missed them. Oh well.

1416
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:28,720
I find it funny that he's been reduced to a four-letter word.

1417
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:31,720
Alright. We're going to post that list and you guys can send in your...

1418
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:32,720
Sort of like Twat.

Don't wanna play a game

1430
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:12,040
I apologize because that was mislabeled, so that wasn't the old school one, but I found

1431
01:57:12,040 --> 01:57:17,080
labeled so that wasn't the old-school one but I found the right one so enjoy a double shot

1432
01:57:42,040 --> 01:57:45,040
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

Ah!

1436

Ah!

1437
01:57:58,040 --> 01:57:59,040
Ah!

1438
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:00,040
Ah!

1439
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:01,040
Ah!

1440
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:02,040
Ah!

1441
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:03,040
Ah!

1442
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:18,040
Get up, stand up, stretch up on your suction bowl

1443
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:22,040
How you gonna be the attraction?

1444
01:59:22,040 --> 01:59:26,040
And why don't you, if you wanna stay to the wall

1445
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:29,040
Ride yourself a piece of reaction

1446
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:32,040
Got you, get out, let's make big fails

1447
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:34,040
Get up, you know when you got to go

1448
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:36,040
Get up, get up, dancing all the time, come on

1449
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:37,040
Here we go, here we go

1450
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:39,040
Get up, stand up

1451
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:41,040
Stretch your body, stretch your neck

1452
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:43,040
Get up, stand up

1453
01:59:44,040 --> 01:59:47,040
Let's just use it there in a corner

1454
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:51,040
Sitting by yourself in the top

1455
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:54,040
You don't really wanna be no, no, no

1456
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:56,040
Come on now, get up and dance, dance, dance, dance

1457
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:58,040
Dance, dance, dance, come on, get your feet

1458
01:59:58,040 --> 02:00:00,040
Wreck my feet, you the most it's gon' be

1459
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:16,040
Get up, stand up, touch up from the shoulder

1460
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:26,040
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF. Looking for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

1461
02:00:26,040 --> 02:00:32,540
But hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great?

1462
02:00:32,540 --> 02:00:35,060
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

1463
02:00:35,060 --> 02:00:41,260
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

1464
02:00:41,260 --> 02:00:45,260
Howdy, kids! We're back, and we're being a little slow

1465
02:00:45,260 --> 02:00:50,900
because the listless votes aren't fully tallied yet, so we're going to go right into this week's cage match.

1466
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:55,840
Uh, last week... oh, I've got to get all this stuff cued up, though. I'm not even ready.

1467
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:57,460
Is there anything, uh...

1468
02:00:57,460 --> 02:01:00,660
Wait, wait, wait, but you said you wanted to make a stipulation before this week's cage...

1469
02:01:00,660 --> 02:01:03,660
Are you pulling out about what you wanted to do in your song last week?

1470
02:01:03,660 --> 02:01:07,660
If I withdrew mine, I'd want to put in a new one, which means I have to go to my car real quick.

1471
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:09,660
Oh, so you have last week's winner in here.

1472
02:01:09,660 --> 02:01:13,660
I put it in there, but I kind of want to withdraw it and put in something new if I can.

1473
02:01:13,660 --> 02:01:16,660
What do you guys think? Well, let's ask the chat room what they think.

1474
02:01:16,660 --> 02:01:19,660
Let's hear a little bit of last week's winner.

1475
02:01:19,660 --> 02:01:20,660
Because Jamie's having second thoughts.

1476
02:01:20,660 --> 02:01:22,660
I hated it. Okay.

1477
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:23,660
Jamie doesn't really like that song.

1478
02:01:23,660 --> 02:01:25,660
I picked it because it was hyper.

1479
02:01:25,660 --> 02:01:26,660
Okay, then we're going to play a little clip of it.

1480
02:01:26,660 --> 02:01:30,720
This is Link's theme, the Heave Dance Remix.

1481
02:01:30,720 --> 02:01:35,580
And if the chat room says it's okay to bend the rules a little bit this week and let Jamie

1482
02:01:35,580 --> 02:01:39,820
take it out and give us something new, then we'll do it.

1483
02:01:39,820 --> 02:01:46,820
so here we go

1484
02:02:09,820 --> 02:02:16,820
Alright, by an overwhelming vote in the chat room, it's out of here. It's gone.

1485
02:02:16,820 --> 02:02:19,820
Alright, I'm going to go get a CD out of the car. I'll be right back.

1486
02:02:19,820 --> 02:02:25,820
Alright, so I'm getting suggestions for what to put in this week, too. That's great.

1487
02:02:25,820 --> 02:02:31,820
Okay, so we're going to start this week's cage match, except I'm short a few songs.

1488
02:02:31,820 --> 02:02:37,820
So, Clean Slate. We have no winners coming over from last week because we're deleting that because it sucked.

1489
02:02:37,820 --> 02:02:45,820
I don't know how it won. I guess the other two songs. I put in Fable, and everybody has something against that song.

1490
02:02:45,820 --> 02:02:54,820
Alright, so I guess I'll start. This is the way, since we're starting with a clean slate tonight, let's refresh everybody on how the cage match works.

1491
02:02:54,820 --> 02:03:06,820
We have this little segment that reoccurs on the show called the Orange Lounge Cage Match. The way it works, each of the hosts puts in one song that they want to put in there.

1492
02:03:06,820 --> 02:03:10,820
And the chat room votes on which is their favorite.

1493
02:03:10,820 --> 02:03:16,820
And the winner gets to go into regular rotation on the station during the Bamani Music & More program.

1494
02:03:16,820 --> 02:03:23,820
So, I'm getting votes for stuff. This is interesting. Oh no. Don't tell me what to put in.

1495
02:03:25,820 --> 02:03:29,820
And like half the ones you're mentioning either suck ass or have already been in there.

1496
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:34,820
No, actually another song by that artist is in there. I get what she was saying.

1497
02:03:34,820 --> 02:03:38,180
I already have I already have a song for this week, but I'll do that for next week. Oh

1498
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:44,020
I'm so tempted to put that song in just J or whatever you're called this week, Justin

1499
02:03:44,020 --> 02:03:48,580
I really want to put that first song in there you sent me, but I'm not ready to yet

1500
02:03:48,580 --> 02:03:51,900
We'll do that next week. Okay, because I really want to do this song this week. So I'll start

1501
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:59,180
My song this week that I'm going to do is by a group that you know from 2dx

1502
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:02,680
They were in seventh style and they have a pretty popular song in there

1503
02:04:02,680 --> 02:04:08,040
the song they did in there was called the beauty of silence and the group is

1504
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:13,880
svenson and guilin and this this is another song by them i have this song

1505
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:17,480
well cool this is uh my pick for tonight's cage match this is a song

1506
02:04:17,480 --> 02:04:20,600
called twisted by the same group that did beauty of silence svenson and

1507
02:04:20,600 --> 02:04:27,600
leland enjoyed

1508
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:43,240
that kind of has an abrupt ending oops that's because it came off a non-stop mix that was

1509
02:06:43,240 --> 02:06:47,200
the actually that was the energy mix of Twisted by Svensson and Geedle in the same group the

1510
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:49,200
beauty of silence and what y'all think

1511
02:06:49,200 --> 02:06:51,200
beauty of silence it ain't

1512
02:06:51,200 --> 02:06:53,200
sorry that was really boring

1513
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:55,200
what do you give it on 110?

1514
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:57,200
well poop on you

1515
02:06:57,200 --> 02:06:59,200
i give it a 5

1516
02:06:59,200 --> 02:07:01,200
right down the middle

1517
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:03,200
zero

1518
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:05,200
i kind of give it

1519
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:07,200
i have to mix it up

1520
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:09,200
i guess i give it a 6

1521
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:11,200
because i really like beauty of silence

1522
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:13,200
and that seemed to have been really well

1523
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:15,200
more real repetitive

1524
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:20,200
I've heard better cuts of that same song, and that was a pretty bad cut of it.

1525
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:29,200
Like you said, it's repetitive, and it does kind of, you know, do something ill with the middle, because in the beginning, it might make you feel bad, but it's not good for the core.

1526
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:31,200
On all of you.

1527
02:07:31,200 --> 02:07:32,200
You're really not gonna like it.

1528
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:33,200
Ice clean.

1529
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:34,200
Yeah.

1530
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:42,200
I don't like repetitive notes, and that was all that was, and I've never heard any other version of that, so that's all I have to go on. I have to give it a three.

1531
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:50,200
I can't really do too much of a judgment as far as cast history on this one goes.

1532
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:52,200
I feel like this one's gonna be with stylists.

1533
02:07:52,200 --> 02:08:00,200
But this one was like, well I'm just going by an overall judgment and I have to give it about a 5 because it was kind of repetitive.

1534
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:03,200
But I kind of liked it too.

1535
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:05,200
It just sounded kind of nice.

1536
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:10,200
Alright, and personally I give that a 150 so that way it averages all your votes to a 10.

1537
02:08:10,200 --> 02:08:11,200
Yeah, that's great.

1538
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:46,160
you saw next week that if you will see i'm gonna come back i'm gonna save this clip of the show

1539
02:08:46,160 --> 02:08:51,040
and after i play what he sent me next week i'm gonna remind you all that you asked me to play

1540
02:08:51,040 --> 02:08:59,120
that okay that's all i have to say all right come on and all your balls need to yeah i don't have

1541
02:08:59,120 --> 02:09:01,500
All right, Jamie, what's your pick tell us about it?

1542
02:09:29,120 --> 02:09:32,620
of people calling my eyes

1543
02:09:32,620 --> 02:09:35,620
they're praying to shake it down

1544
02:09:35,620 --> 02:09:39,620
saying, oh, dear, dear

1545
02:09:39,620 --> 02:09:43,620
they're really saying, I'm

1546
02:09:46,620 --> 02:09:47,120
hi

1547
02:09:47,120 --> 02:09:49,620
I don't know what happened

1548
02:09:49,620 --> 02:09:51,620
I don't know what happened, let me have a sip, sorry.

1549
02:10:08,620 --> 02:10:13,620
Okay, I'm going to abort this real fast because we're going to try switching it around a little bit.

1550
02:10:13,620 --> 02:10:14,620
We're having issues with that CD.

1551
02:10:14,620 --> 02:10:16,620
I burned this like three days ago.

1552
02:10:16,620 --> 02:10:18,620
Let's see, I'm going to put it in the other drive and see what happens.

1553
02:10:18,620 --> 02:10:22,620
It's a pretty big scratch right there.

1554
02:10:22,620 --> 02:10:26,620
Yeah, it's a pretty big scratch right in the middle.

1555
02:10:26,620 --> 02:10:30,620
Well, let's try it.

1556
02:10:30,620 --> 02:10:34,620
Okay, we're going to restart this.

1557
02:10:34,620 --> 02:10:38,620
This is the burner.

1558
02:10:38,620 --> 02:10:42,620
Sorry about that.

1559
02:10:42,620 --> 02:10:46,620
I don't have the three of that with me.

1560
02:10:46,620 --> 02:10:48,620
Thank you everybody.

1561
02:11:16,620 --> 02:11:18,620
Oh

1562
02:11:46,620 --> 02:11:47,620
Now what?

1563
02:12:17,620 --> 02:12:43,620
I see trees of green, red-rooted tombs I see them bloom, poor me and you

1564
02:12:43,620 --> 02:12:54,620
And I think to myself what a wonderful world

1565
02:12:56,620 --> 02:13:01,620
I wanna see the skies of blue

1566
02:13:01,620 --> 02:13:04,620
And clouds of white

1567
02:13:04,620 --> 02:13:07,620
The brightest light of day

1568
02:13:07,620 --> 02:13:11,620
The dark state of night

1569
02:13:11,620 --> 02:13:14,620
I've got things in my hand

1570
02:13:16,620 --> 02:13:20,620
What a wonderful way

1571
02:13:20,620 --> 02:13:27,620
What a wonderful land

1572
02:13:27,620 --> 02:13:53,620
What a wonderful land

1573
02:14:53,620 --> 02:14:56,620
I'm also a little lazy

1574
02:14:56,620 --> 02:14:59,620
Of people going by

1575
02:14:59,620 --> 02:15:03,620
I can feel shaking hands

1576
02:15:03,620 --> 02:15:07,620
Staying for the reason

1577
02:15:07,620 --> 02:15:10,620
That everything is being

1578
02:15:10,620 --> 02:15:14,620
All I love is

1579
02:15:14,620 --> 02:15:18,620
I hear a baby cry

1580
02:15:18,620 --> 02:15:21,620
One second cry

1581
02:15:21,620 --> 02:15:27,620
There ain't much more that I ever know

1582
02:15:28,620 --> 02:15:30,620
The things in my head

1583
02:15:32,620 --> 02:15:38,620
They're a wonderful world

1584
02:15:38,620 --> 02:15:45,620
But I don't want you to go away

1585
02:16:08,620 --> 02:16:18,620
kostjamrh Alrighty, that was Beatbox from The What A Wonderful World.

1586
02:16:18,620 --> 02:16:25,620
Alrighty, tell us what you thought, give it a scale of 110. Jamie?

1587
02:16:25,620 --> 02:16:32,620
Oh wait, oops, I have the volume way up too loud. Sorry about that. Jamie, tell us again. Sorry, I had the volume way too loud on that. Tell us what's out of that.

1588
02:16:32,620 --> 02:16:33,620
Twenty-four.

1589
02:16:33,620 --> 02:16:34,620
Okay.

1590
02:16:34,620 --> 02:16:48,620
Um... I didn't like it very much. I... It was... I'm sorry, I don't like club mixes of, like, songs like that. It's just... it just doesn't fit.

1591
02:16:48,620 --> 02:16:53,620
Everyone thinks that the formula for a dance song is let's put a beat to it and add lyrics from an old song.

1592
02:16:53,620 --> 02:16:54,620
No, it's not gonna work.

1593
02:16:54,620 --> 02:16:56,620
So, um...

1594
02:16:56,620 --> 02:17:01,620
And then that part in the end where it starts kinda doing this little thing where it starts changing the pitch a little bit,

1595
02:17:01,620 --> 02:17:05,620
where it starts getting way out of key and then coming back in, I don't know what the hell that was either.

1596
02:17:05,620 --> 02:17:07,620
So I go to six.

1597
02:17:07,620 --> 02:17:09,620
Better than the other song, but still.

1598
02:17:09,620 --> 02:17:11,620
Alright, zero.

1599
02:17:11,620 --> 02:17:14,620
Generally, I don't really care what it is.

1600
02:17:14,620 --> 02:17:21,620
I personally liked that song. I liked the variety, I liked how it wasn't the same goddamn beat the whole way through.

1601
02:17:44,620 --> 02:17:47,620
So they'd be faded out, in a faded bag, different kind.

1602
02:17:47,620 --> 02:17:52,620
And yes, I like this one too, the original, so I'm going to have to give that one a 10.

1603
02:17:52,620 --> 02:17:54,620
Just because that's a happy song.

1604
02:17:54,620 --> 02:17:57,620
This one's a happy song. Very, very happy, happy.

1605
02:17:57,620 --> 02:18:03,620
I liked it. I wasn't too crazy about how the rhythm kind of reminded me of Beauty and Silence

1606
02:18:03,620 --> 02:18:05,620
and there's a little hint to that.

1607
02:18:05,620 --> 02:18:11,620
But overall, it's a very nice sounding song, a little on the long side, but not too bad.

1608
02:18:11,620 --> 02:18:14,620
I'll give it an 8. It's nice.

1609
02:18:32,620 --> 02:18:35,620
That song makes my heart happy whenever I'm in a rotten room.

1610
02:18:35,620 --> 02:18:38,620
That's one of the few songs that just makes me happy all over.

1611
02:19:05,620 --> 02:19:15,620
Night Angel Mix, it's Loki vs. Steve Reiner, featuring a Solaris or something like that.

1612
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:17,620
Okay, here you go

1613
02:20:15,620 --> 02:20:43,620
It's a long way to go, honey It's a long way to go, honey

1614
02:20:43,620 --> 02:20:45,620
It's a long way to go, honey.

1615
02:20:46,620 --> 02:20:50,620
I know. But I'm awake. How are we going?

1616
02:20:50,620 --> 02:20:54,620
Into the dark, black forest.

1617
02:21:50,620 --> 02:22:16,060
Okay, what did y'all think of that one?

1618
02:22:16,060 --> 02:22:21,060
How is Steve Rider vs Loki featuring Solaris with Dark Black Forest?

1619
02:22:21,060 --> 02:22:26,060
Keep in mind that I'm trying to bypass my bias against Dark Black Forest.

1620
02:22:26,060 --> 02:22:29,060
Because I'm utterly sick and disgusted with that song.

1621
02:22:29,060 --> 02:22:32,060
However, it was nicely done.

1622
02:22:32,060 --> 02:22:36,060
So I'm trying to bypass my bias with that song.

1623
02:22:36,060 --> 02:22:42,060
I give it a seven, plain, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, eight, eight.

1624
02:22:42,060 --> 02:22:45,060
Okay.

1625
02:22:45,060 --> 02:22:47,060
Loki?

1626
02:22:47,060 --> 02:22:51,060
As mentioned in the chatroom, it doesn't sound very remixed.

1627
02:22:51,060 --> 02:22:58,060
There's actually a lot of subtle stuff, and there's a few more synth things added to the actual main synth of the song.

1628
02:22:58,060 --> 02:23:01,060
So it's kind of hard to detect that there.

1629
02:23:01,060 --> 02:23:08,060
It was a mix between one song by Sinaris, I don't remember exactly what the song was called,

1630
02:23:08,060 --> 02:23:18,060
And uh, Dark Black Forest, uh, long trip, so there's a lot of stuff that sounds the same, but you know, overall it is really mixed, not just like, oh, here's Dark Black Forest, I'm just going through that.

1631
02:23:18,060 --> 02:23:25,060
But um, I give it an 8 because the Legend of Trance is way better, but you know, I'm getting better, working on it.

1632
02:23:25,060 --> 02:23:27,060
Alright, Zero?

1633
02:23:27,060 --> 02:23:34,060
I don't know how many more trips to the dark black forest we need to take, but it was pretty good.

1634
02:23:34,060 --> 02:23:38,060
And look, he's right, there's a lot of slow stuff, so for you people who didn't hear it, turn your

1635
02:23:38,060 --> 02:23:42,060
stereos or headphones up really really loud and you'll be able to hear it.

1636
02:23:42,060 --> 02:23:46,060
But I guess I'll give it an 8 because I still did enjoy it.

1637
02:23:49,060 --> 02:23:55,060
I have to agree with the last two clips, I give it an 8 just because I liked it.

1638
02:23:55,060 --> 02:24:05,060
The beginning was kind of a little bit slow, but it was very repetitive.

1639
02:24:05,060 --> 02:24:08,060
But then it picked up and I liked it again.

1640
02:24:08,060 --> 02:24:13,060
I think I'll give it an 8, because I...

1641
02:24:13,060 --> 02:24:19,060
Oh, wait a minute. I'm thinking backwards. I'm giving it a 7, because...

1642
02:24:19,060 --> 02:24:32,060
The previous song, I thought that was a bit better. I like that one. This one is good, but it does sound a little bit like the original, so I like the first or second entry the best.

1643
02:24:49,060 --> 02:24:53,060
It was just Dark Black Forest's long trip with some subtle synth.

1644
02:24:53,060 --> 02:24:57,060
The next one is going to be totally different than the trance remixes I've been doing.

1645
02:24:57,060 --> 02:25:01,060
It's going to be an even more hardcore version of Sligo Works.

1646
02:25:01,060 --> 02:25:03,060
You're going to love it.

1647
02:25:03,060 --> 02:25:04,060
Okay, let's recap.

1648
02:25:04,060 --> 02:25:06,060
I'm getting happy thinking about that.

1649
02:25:06,060 --> 02:25:07,060
Quick recap, here we go.

1650
02:25:07,060 --> 02:25:08,060
These are the three things you can vote for.

1651
02:25:08,060 --> 02:25:11,060
You can send your votes now over private messages to Sky in the chat room.

1652
02:25:11,060 --> 02:25:13,060
First one you can vote for,

1653
02:25:13,060 --> 02:25:28,780
Second one you can vote for, Beatbox, right, is that Beatbox?

1654
02:25:28,780 --> 02:25:33,300
Beatbox with What a Wonderful World is the other one you can vote for.

1655
02:25:33,300 --> 02:25:34,300
CD Fire's out.

1656
02:25:34,300 --> 02:25:56,160
All right, and the third song you can vote for, Steve Reiner vs. Loki featuring Solaris

1657
02:25:56,160 --> 02:26:15,760
Cenaris with Dark Black Forest.

1658
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:21,680
Alright, again, first song was Svensson and Gleelan with Twisted, second song was Beatbox

1659
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:26,040
with A Wonderful World, third song was Steve Reiner vs Loki featuring Cenaris with What

1660
02:26:26,040 --> 02:26:30,040
I just thought of my next week's song. Damn it, that sucks.

1661
02:26:30,040 --> 02:26:32,040
Oh, you just thought of the song you really wanted to do?

1662
02:26:32,040 --> 02:26:35,040
I just thought it was in my car, too. It was like, ehh, next week.

1663
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:39,040
Alright. So, there you go. Send your votes in now to Sky.

1664
02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:42,040
In the meantime, we don't want to go right to a break, because we just played a bunch of music.

1665
02:26:42,040 --> 02:26:46,040
So, let's try to chat it up a little bit, shall we?

1666
02:26:46,040 --> 02:26:49,040
Who has something they want to talk about?

1667
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:50,040
Loki.

1668
02:26:50,040 --> 02:26:54,040
Well, let's see. Uh, Jackie? Wait.

1669
02:26:54,040 --> 02:27:00,800
I haven't made a racial comment this week yet. Oh dear god. Okay, good, because I'm

1670
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:05,680
not going to. I'm not going to, but I was just thinking back to when we were talking

1671
02:27:05,680 --> 02:27:16,280
over food at TJ Friday's about my blank owner's club game where you have to train your people

1672
02:27:16,280 --> 02:27:28,520
I still like mocap bakery.

1673
02:27:28,520 --> 02:27:34,520
And then what was yours, mocap hansel and gretel, where you shove the little children

1674
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:36,520
into an oven?

1675
02:27:36,520 --> 02:27:46,440
Well, let's see, big news, this week opening up was Dreamcatcher, and for all the, yeah,

1676
02:27:46,440 --> 02:27:50,800
yeah, I agree Dreamcatcher looked like ass, but you know what was before it? It was the

1677
02:27:50,800 --> 02:27:56,680
Final Play of Osiris, and that kicks ass. I would go see it just for that.

1678
02:27:56,680 --> 02:28:05,680
I would pay matinee prices just to go see that, that, and I'd just walk out of the movie.

1679
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:20,560
Q. Ever since Puppy introduced me to BitTorrent, I've been loving downloading things for free,

1680
02:28:20,560 --> 02:28:21,560
like movies.

1681
02:28:21,560 --> 02:28:26,880
And I downloaded that movie Foam Booth, which Brad and I were telling me that it was actually

1682
02:28:26,880 --> 02:28:38,820
just a rip-off of an old movie with Wesley Snipes in it. I was getting that and what

1683
02:28:38,820 --> 02:28:43,960
sucked is I left it on for about 18 hours to get the goddamn movie and then it wouldn't

1684
02:28:43,960 --> 02:28:48,440
even burn because it told me I had the wrong type of burner to do it. I'm so mad. I'm gonna

1685
02:28:48,440 --> 02:28:51,900
just burn off those files and take it to someone else's house. But I'm like, how cool. I can

1686
02:28:51,900 --> 02:28:55,840
have like a movie like two weeks before it's out in the theater and then I was

1687
02:28:55,840 --> 02:29:02,960
getting phone booth it's um this new program it's called bit torrent and if

1688
02:29:02,960 --> 02:29:08,560
black lab has a link to that site he gave me that would be cool it's this

1689
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:13,800
it's I I would say it's like win MX or something like that but it's not it's a

1690
02:29:13,800 --> 02:29:17,760
little different because it's not a separate client it's a download tool you

1691
02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:25,700
install into your browser, so when you start downloading a file with a.torrent extension,

1692
02:29:25,700 --> 02:29:30,160
what you do is you start downloading this file from, I guess, I don't know, it tells

1693
02:29:30,160 --> 02:29:35,040
you where everybody else has the file, and you start downloading from people, and then

1694
02:29:35,040 --> 02:29:38,080
as you're downloading it, when new people start downloading, they start downloading

1695
02:29:38,080 --> 02:29:42,640
from you. So the key is to make it work, you have to leave your thing on for like a couple

1696
02:29:42,640 --> 02:29:46,200
hours after you finish so other people can finish their stuff too. But it's a way of

1697
02:29:46,200 --> 02:29:50,720
just basically file distribution. It's mass leeching and seeding and all that. But it's

1698
02:29:50,720 --> 02:30:02,000
cool. How I've used it so far, I've gotten like a couple CDs in a movie, and I'm working

1699
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:05,160
on getting Final Fantasy Origins, but it's not finished yet. And I had to stop it because

1700
02:30:05,160 --> 02:30:13,080
we had to start the show. The Final Fantasy I and II for America? Yep. That'll be fun.

1701
02:30:13,080 --> 02:30:17,080
Okay, so what else is on y'all's minds? How was your week? How was your week, Anita?

1702
02:30:17,080 --> 02:30:24,080
My week was pretty good. On Saturday, we went out to the store, did a little browsing at a game shop.

1703
02:30:24,080 --> 02:30:27,080
I bought.hack, the new PlayStation 2 game.

1704
02:30:27,080 --> 02:30:28,080
And how's that? How'd you like it?

1705
02:30:28,080 --> 02:30:32,080
I haven't started yet, but it looks really, really cool. I just got it.

1706
02:30:32,080 --> 02:30:38,080
But if anybody out there has any advice or any experience playing.hack,

1707
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:48,080
Well, actually, I think Ice Princess has many good comments on the series, right? No? Yeah,.hack? No?

1708
02:30:48,080 --> 02:30:51,080
Who was that? Some people are saying that this series was great.

1709
02:30:51,080 --> 02:30:52,080
I don't remember.

1710
02:30:52,080 --> 02:30:53,080
Loki.

1711
02:30:53,080 --> 02:31:03,080
I heard it was good. I've never seen it. Actually, to be honest, to be honest, looking at the game from the screenshots I've seen, it looks like ass, but, you know, I don't know.

1712
02:31:03,080 --> 02:31:06,080
It's good enough to spawn two more sequels.

1713
02:31:06,080 --> 02:31:08,080
Whoopity-doo!

1714
02:31:36,080 --> 02:31:41,560
I'm sure the summoner did have one good thing about it and that was that

1715
02:31:41,560 --> 02:31:46,040
previous thing that they did based on the attention to dragons thing got any

1716
02:31:46,040 --> 02:31:52,340
dr. pepper no Mountain Dew got any Mountain Dew like yeah it's in the

1717
02:31:52,340 --> 02:31:59,900
fridge am I in the tavern yet no why cuz if there's any hot chicks there I want

1718
02:31:59,900 --> 02:32:01,900
You have to do them!

1719
02:32:29,900 --> 02:32:45,900
of their original tension, but it's a lot more realistic, and the cutscenes when you stealthily kill somebody is awesome. Their heads just pop right off. You jab them and you can kick cats and dogs. All kinds of stuff. It's actually pretty good.

1720
02:32:59,900 --> 02:33:04,740
somebody get cut in the throat and you see like ten gallons of blood squirt out.

1721
02:33:04,740 --> 02:33:09,900
The bloodshed is the whole point of that game. The bloodshed is the point of that game as

1722
02:33:09,900 --> 02:33:15,620
to Resident Evil or anything else. It's just really really cool. It's like asking why anime

1723
02:33:15,620 --> 02:33:20,620
chicks have such big breasts. They just do. That is the point.

1724
02:33:20,620 --> 02:33:31,020
Why does Saga Frontier suck? Let's see here. Not only do you get 1 shitty quest, but no,

1725
02:33:31,020 --> 02:33:36,060
you get 12 shitty quests that you get to go on there almost exactly the same. Plus, the

1726
02:33:36,060 --> 02:33:39,220
graphics sucked ass, and the game was just boring as hell.

1727
02:33:39,220 --> 02:33:40,220
And the title's crappy.

1728
02:33:40,220 --> 02:33:42,860
The end. I ended up buying it, playing it for a week, and selling it back.

1729
02:33:42,860 --> 02:33:46,580
And for the record, graphics do not equal gameplay.

1730
02:33:46,580 --> 02:33:53,580
But the gameplay wasn't anything good either, so I was like, well, maybe the graphics...no, no, sorry.

1731
02:33:53,580 --> 02:34:02,580
I'm serious, if they had a role-playing game that was like just the regular text scrolling ones that were from way back in the day, I can enjoy those more if they had a good story.

1732
02:34:02,580 --> 02:34:08,580
No, what was freaking awesome is they're making this new side-scrolling game that's just like Contra, but you get to make your own levels.

1733
02:34:08,580 --> 02:34:09,580
Oh, that's cool.

1734
02:34:09,580 --> 02:34:10,580
It's got a level editor in it.

1735
02:34:10,580 --> 02:34:14,580
That's cool. Now, I've been hearing that Unlimited Saga's supposed to be pretty redeeming.

1736
02:34:14,580 --> 02:34:17,580
Yeah, see, well, it has about time.

1737
02:34:17,580 --> 02:34:20,580
Because it's technically in the series.

1738
02:34:20,580 --> 02:34:24,580
They've got like all sorts of neat limited box sets and blah blah blah.

1739
02:34:26,580 --> 02:34:31,580
Yes, we're going to come back after a quick break with the results for both list lists, because we never did those.

1740
02:34:31,580 --> 02:34:35,580
And the cage match, so it's going to be a whole results set when we come back from break.

1741
02:34:35,580 --> 02:34:39,580
But first, Chat Room would like to request no Saga Frontier bashing.

1742
02:34:41,580 --> 02:34:43,580
It sucks ass.

1743
02:34:43,580 --> 02:34:49,580
In fact, Square should denounce, you know, Soccer Patiers being part of their, you know, whole lineup.

1744
02:34:49,580 --> 02:34:56,580
You know what game that Square needs to denounce? Is, uh, freakin', um, uh, Legend of Mana, not, not...

1745
02:34:56,580 --> 02:35:00,580
No, not Secret of Mana, Legend of Mana. That game was shit.

1746
02:35:00,580 --> 02:35:06,580
Okay, I was thinking, I went ahead and got the import of that because I was like, oh, you know, it's Legend of Mana, what the hell?

1747
02:35:06,580 --> 02:35:11,580
You know, I was thinking it was, you know, more Seiken than Sezu. But that was ass.

1748
02:35:11,580 --> 02:35:16,580
I was about to think that you were about to say the Secret of Mana, and I would have bit-stopped you in a TomorrowCade.

1749
02:35:16,580 --> 02:35:23,580
No, dude, I have my copy, okay, with my character named after me, although I hate to really like the blonde girl, but...

1750
02:35:23,580 --> 02:35:25,580
Okay, so I don't have to bit-stop you.

1751
02:35:25,580 --> 02:35:32,580
And then I have Senka Densetsu, but I need to re-get the ROM for Senka Densetsu 3, the one that's fully translated down to the graphics.

1752
02:35:32,580 --> 02:35:37,580
Very nice. Or just, you know, borrow my friend's cartridge for Super Nintendo.

1753
02:35:37,580 --> 02:35:43,500
I bashed soccer frontier in my sleep that it was a horrible game and anyone who likes

1754
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:49,900
it play it again yeah if soccer frontier happens to sneak into my dreams you know then suddenly

1755
02:35:49,900 --> 02:35:57,420
i wake up with the urge to vomit good i'm done with one club damn it there's more one

1756
02:35:57,420 --> 02:36:05,420
thing in this favor it had good music it had some good music it's like that rap city musical

1757
02:36:05,420 --> 02:36:12,420
the first village before we package that shit up and turn it back in. We did not even go

1758
02:36:12,420 --> 02:36:18,420
That game sucked, right slide. Um, Ephemeral Fantasia, that game sucked.

1759
02:36:18,420 --> 02:36:25,420
Is the game, it was a put out, it was a RPG put out by Konami, and apparently you can use your guitar for each controller with it?

1760
02:36:25,420 --> 02:36:32,420
That game is ass. Dan and I barely, we didn't even get past the first village before we packaged that shit up and turned it back in.

1761
02:36:32,420 --> 02:36:38,420
We did not even go as far to see if our controllers would work with the US version. We took that shit back.

1762
02:36:38,420 --> 02:36:40,420
More like effeminate fantasia.

1763
02:38:08,420 --> 02:38:10,420
I

1764
02:38:38,420 --> 02:38:52,420
When you're coming down, you'll be alive

1765
02:38:52,420 --> 02:38:55,420
You don't have to believe, you can call yourself

1766
02:38:55,420 --> 02:38:59,420
When it comes time to find things you wanted to do

1767
02:38:59,420 --> 02:39:03,420
So you don't start this city no fair

1768
02:39:03,420 --> 02:39:06,420
If you love me baby, you can call yourself

1769
02:39:06,420 --> 02:39:09,420
Before it won't give in

1770
02:39:09,420 --> 02:39:12,420
While you listen to the song

1771
02:39:12,420 --> 02:39:14,420
It's too much for me to ask

1772
02:39:14,420 --> 02:39:17,420
Do you write a song so hard on my side?

1773
02:39:17,420 --> 02:39:19,420
Lead up, talk to me

1774
02:39:19,420 --> 02:39:21,420
Do you feel like I'm gonna last

1775
02:39:21,420 --> 02:39:24,420
I'm in it all day

1776
02:39:24,420 --> 02:39:28,420
Do you wanna be fine?

1777
02:39:28,420 --> 02:39:30,420
If I look at you

1778
02:39:30,420 --> 02:39:31,420
I'll be right with you

1779
02:39:31,420 --> 02:39:33,420
Ready, ready, ready

1780
02:40:03,420 --> 02:40:10,420
Who's on the turntables tonight, my son?

1781
02:41:03,420 --> 02:41:31,420
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1782
02:41:31,420 --> 02:41:33,420
Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?

1783
02:41:33,420 --> 02:41:35,420
No!

1784
02:41:35,420 --> 02:41:37,420
Do we care what people think of us?

1785
02:41:37,420 --> 02:41:39,420
No!

1786
02:41:39,420 --> 02:41:41,420
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1787
02:41:41,420 --> 02:41:43,420
Yeah!

1788
02:41:43,420 --> 02:41:45,420
Yeah!

1789
02:41:45,420 --> 02:41:47,420
Extreme Babati Radio

1790
02:41:47,420 --> 02:41:51,420
That's us, Orange Lounge Radio

1791
02:41:51,420 --> 02:41:53,420
Alright, we're back

1792
02:41:53,420 --> 02:41:57,420
Featuring the buzz, episode number 37

1793
02:41:57,420 --> 02:41:59,420
Episode number 37

1794
02:41:59,420 --> 02:42:00,420
Thank you.

1795
02:42:00,420 --> 02:42:01,420
Of Orange Lounge Radio.

1796
02:42:01,420 --> 02:42:02,420
We're back.

1797
02:42:02,420 --> 02:42:04,220
And we have results, results, results for you people.

1798
02:42:04,220 --> 02:42:06,140
And then we're going to whore a few things out.

1799
02:42:06,140 --> 02:42:11,420
We're going to give, we're going to open it up to the chat room to plug anything they

1800
02:42:11,420 --> 02:42:12,420
want.

1801
02:42:12,420 --> 02:42:13,940
Anything they want to plug.

1802
02:42:13,940 --> 02:42:16,580
You got 15 minutes left to show to do it.

1803
02:42:16,580 --> 02:42:17,580
What?

1804
02:42:17,580 --> 02:42:20,340
Don't be afraid of people plugging stuff in public.

1805
02:42:20,340 --> 02:42:23,660
Anything you guys want to plug, send it to me over a private message and we'll plug it.

1806
02:42:23,660 --> 02:42:24,660
Live on air.

1807
02:42:24,660 --> 02:42:25,660
Alright.

1808
02:42:25,660 --> 02:42:26,900
And we got a few plugs of our own we want to do.

1809
02:42:26,900 --> 02:42:29,260
So we're going to have plug mania in a minute.

1810
02:42:29,260 --> 02:42:34,640
In the meantime, let's announce, first, the winners of our listless segment.

1811
02:42:34,640 --> 02:42:38,500
Top three things that Konami needs to apologize for.

1812
02:42:38,500 --> 02:42:39,540
Number three.

1813
02:42:39,540 --> 02:42:40,540
Number three.

1814
02:42:40,540 --> 02:42:41,540
Bag.

1815
02:42:41,540 --> 02:42:42,540
Yay!

1816
02:42:42,540 --> 02:42:44,240
Please apologize.

1817
02:42:44,240 --> 02:42:47,740
You can send those cards and letters care of all Bomani players.

1818
02:42:47,740 --> 02:42:48,740
Bag.

1819
02:42:48,740 --> 02:42:49,740
Number two.

1820
02:42:49,740 --> 02:42:50,740
Castlevania 64.

1821
02:42:50,740 --> 02:42:51,740
Indeed.

1822
02:42:51,740 --> 02:42:54,780
And you can write that to all of America for Castlevania 64.

1823
02:42:54,780 --> 02:42:55,780
Apologies.

1824
02:42:55,780 --> 02:43:01,780
The number one thing that Sami needs to apologize for is fucking Polteri.

1825
02:43:04,780 --> 02:43:05,780
By quite a bit of a margin.

1826
02:43:05,780 --> 02:43:07,780
She seems like she's being fucked.

1827
02:43:07,780 --> 02:43:10,780
That's why she keeps going off key and rhythm.

1828
02:43:10,780 --> 02:43:11,780
Alright.

1829
02:43:12,780 --> 02:43:15,780
Moving on, now let's announce the winner of the cage match.

1830
02:43:15,780 --> 02:43:17,780
The cage match had a lot of votes tonight, you guys.

1831
02:43:17,780 --> 02:43:21,780
I'm very happy and it was actually kind of close.

1832
02:43:21,780 --> 02:43:22,780
I was very surprised.

1833
02:43:22,780 --> 02:43:45,780
What a wonderful world wins the cage match this week.

1834
02:43:45,780 --> 02:43:47,780
I'm full of happy feelings right now.

1835
02:43:47,780 --> 02:43:50,780
So, enjoy.

1836
02:43:50,780 --> 02:43:53,780
Now, let's see.

1837
02:43:53,780 --> 02:43:55,780
We're going to plug stuff.

1838
02:43:55,780 --> 02:43:58,780
So, first thing we want to plug. There's tournaments we have to plug.

1839
02:43:58,780 --> 02:44:05,780
In two weeks, we will be broadcasting live from March Madness.

1840
02:44:05,780 --> 02:44:06,780
It's going to be a huge tournament.

1841
02:44:06,780 --> 02:44:09,780
DDR Freestyle Idol is a part of that.

1842
02:44:09,780 --> 02:44:11,780
PA 64 person bracket.

1843
02:44:11,780 --> 02:44:14,780
So even if you suck at PA, come because you're going to qualify.

1844
02:44:14,780 --> 02:44:16,780
With 64 people, that's awesome.

1845
02:44:16,780 --> 02:44:20,780
Not to mention, I think the first NorCal 2DX tournament, right?

1846
02:44:20,780 --> 02:44:24,780
Yes, the very first NorCal official 2DX tournament.

1847
02:44:24,780 --> 02:44:28,780
I think there might have been some impromptu ones, but this is the first official 2DX tournament.

1848
02:44:28,780 --> 02:44:30,780
That one's only on Saturday, by the way.

1849
02:44:30,780 --> 02:44:32,780
Yes, that's Saturday night, only Saturday night.

1850
02:44:32,780 --> 02:44:36,780
And Saturday and Sunday, both days, is the tournament.

1851
02:44:36,780 --> 02:44:40,780
We'll be broadcasting live both days, all day long.

1852
02:44:40,780 --> 02:44:42,780
So that's something else.

1853
02:44:42,780 --> 02:44:47,300
Join us in the channel and all that fun stuff.

1854
02:44:47,300 --> 02:44:51,160
Another tournament we're going to be at in May, and I'm sure I've already gotten private

1855
02:44:51,160 --> 02:44:54,700
messages asking me to plug this, so I'll get to those in a little bit.

1856
02:44:54,700 --> 02:45:00,680
But B3, going to be huge, Pier 39, two days, I believe it's May, and I'm going to get killed

1857
02:45:00,680 --> 02:45:04,740
if it's the wrong date, but I'm going off the top of my head, May 17th and 18th, yes?

1858
02:45:04,740 --> 02:45:05,740
I think.

1859
02:45:05,740 --> 02:45:06,740
Look at the calendar.

1860
02:45:06,740 --> 02:45:08,020
I'm going to look at the calendar, because I think I might be wrong.

1861
02:45:08,020 --> 02:45:11,200
I have this really bad feeling I'm wrong, but somebody, I'm sure somebody asked me to

1862
02:45:11,200 --> 02:45:12,200
plug it anyway.

1863
02:45:12,200 --> 02:45:14,120
I'm right, it is 17th and 18th, woohoo!

1864
02:45:14,120 --> 02:45:17,180
Okay, so we'll be broadcasting live from there, too.

1865
02:45:17,180 --> 02:45:20,540
And then, season three of Orange Lounge Radio

1866
02:45:20,540 --> 02:45:23,280
starts also in May, and that's gonna be a big deal,

1867
02:45:23,280 --> 02:45:25,200
because we have a new toy

1868
02:45:25,200 --> 02:45:26,800
that we're gonna be bringing with us.

1869
02:45:26,800 --> 02:45:28,020
We can't say anything about it,

1870
02:45:28,020 --> 02:45:30,160
because we don't know for sure we're gonna have it yet,

1871
02:45:30,160 --> 02:45:31,400
but we're trying very hard.

1872
02:45:31,400 --> 02:45:35,280
And we're gonna have a lot more wonderful interaction

1873
02:45:35,280 --> 02:45:37,640
with audio-wise movement,

1874
02:45:37,640 --> 02:45:41,960
hook the hell out of TVs hooked up to the sound system,

1875
02:45:41,960 --> 02:45:46,280
other things. We get to play porn on air and all that wonderful stuff.

1876
02:45:46,280 --> 02:45:48,840
It's going to be very interesting. Also, the other thing that's going to be different about

1877
02:45:48,840 --> 02:45:50,920
Season 3 is that we're going to have a much larger studio.

1878
02:45:50,920 --> 02:45:53,200
Oh, hell yeah. So that should be interesting too.

1879
02:45:53,200 --> 02:46:00,200
Hopefully we won't suffocate to that. Okay, so let's see what the chat room wanted

1880
02:46:01,320 --> 02:46:04,880
us to plug. Because they do this on late night talk shows. You know, they get to plug whatever

1881
02:46:04,880 --> 02:46:07,760
they want when the guests come on. So, is there anything in here anyone would like to

1882
02:46:07,760 --> 02:46:10,880
plug? It doesn't even have to be Monty related. Something you want to plug. That you need

1883
02:46:10,880 --> 02:46:19,080
to date, do you need any money? As always, of course, it's going to be www.willddr4food.net

1884
02:46:19,080 --> 02:46:24,640
slash leech from Loki. Can't forget that. Tomorrow, there will be an update. A couple

1885
02:46:24,640 --> 02:46:29,480
hundred files will be coming up online. It's going to be the official stuff. Right now,

1886
02:46:29,480 --> 02:46:38,720
we've got prepped, let's see, most of DDR Extreme, all of DDR First through Fifth Mix,

1887
02:46:38,720 --> 02:46:50,720
DDR Solo and I'm going to try to get Max and Max 2 done tonight as well as the other smaller ones like OHA and all those. I think I should be able to get those done tonight. We'll see.

1888
02:46:50,720 --> 02:46:52,720
So those will be coming out tomorrow.

1889
02:46:54,720 --> 02:46:56,720
Anybody else want to plug something in here?

1890
02:46:58,720 --> 02:47:00,720
I need SEX!

1891
02:47:01,720 --> 02:47:04,720
And if they want to fuck the shit out of you, where should they email?

1892
02:47:04,720 --> 02:47:09,720
9-1-6, go cheap.

1893
02:47:09,720 --> 02:47:14,720
Or just look for him on the corner of 27th and J.

1894
02:47:14,720 --> 02:47:19,720
1-900-FUCK-ASS

1895
02:47:19,720 --> 02:47:24,720
Alright, let's go through the shower and see what they want to plug.

1896
02:47:24,720 --> 02:47:29,720
Justin's Circuit would like us all to pay a visit to www.sifam.com

1897
02:47:29,720 --> 02:47:57,720

1906
02:48:23,200 --> 02:48:24,800
all right uh... i'd like to go on

1907
02:48:24,800 --> 02:48:25,920
i'd like to

1908
02:48:25,920 --> 02:48:29,720
I'd like to plug, but I can't. Okay, thank you, sorry.

1909
02:48:29,720 --> 02:48:34,960
Uh... 23rd Magus says he would like to plug and chug

1910
02:48:34,960 --> 02:48:39,040
www.unglued.tk

1911
02:48:39,040 --> 02:48:42,920
or ungluedbamani.tk. I'm not sure if they're two different sites or the same

1912
02:48:42,920 --> 02:48:44,120
site, but visit them both.

1913
02:48:44,120 --> 02:48:50,360
unglued.tk and ungluedbamani.tk. Fear some more and fear him the most.

1914
02:48:50,360 --> 02:48:53,720
That's alright. And they're having a cake versus pie

1915
02:48:53,720 --> 02:48:57,320
argument in the chat room right now. Quick, quick everybody, cake or pie?

1916
02:48:57,320 --> 02:49:01,320
Pie. Cake. Cake. 3.14

1917
02:49:01,320 --> 02:49:06,520
Cake. I say pie. But you know what? Cheesecake

1918
02:49:06,520 --> 02:49:10,080
owns them both. I like cake though. I like cake better than pie.

1919
02:49:10,080 --> 02:49:13,640
Cheesecake owns them both, end of story.

1920
02:49:13,640 --> 02:49:17,240
Ice cream cake.

1921
02:49:17,240 --> 02:49:21,680
Alright. Cake pie. Yes, cake flavored pie.

1922
02:49:21,680 --> 02:49:29,680
For my birthday, I want an ice cream cake. I want a cold-stead one that's cake batter flavored with brownies in it.

1923
02:49:29,680 --> 02:49:34,680
I want an erotic cake for my birthday. No, just like in the end of that Simpsons episode.

1924
02:49:34,680 --> 02:49:35,680
A cake with boobies?

1925
02:49:35,680 --> 02:49:42,680
My dad, for his 50th birthday, had a booby cake. And it was a couple of big boobs that was a cake, and then it had a little bra on it.

1926
02:49:42,680 --> 02:49:44,680
And it had a skier, skiing down one of the boobs.

1927
02:49:44,680 --> 02:49:46,680
Oh, slopes.

1928
02:49:46,680 --> 02:49:49,520
Okay, enough of cake versus pie, we're done.

1929
02:49:49,520 --> 02:49:50,520
Alright.

1930
02:49:50,520 --> 02:49:55,080
AZHP wants us to plug NBOR3.

1931
02:49:55,080 --> 02:49:56,080
Very good opportunity.

1932
02:49:56,080 --> 02:50:00,480
I try to plug these occasionally, we all try to talk about our forums, but not enough people

1933
02:50:00,480 --> 02:50:01,480
are going there.

1934
02:50:01,480 --> 02:50:02,960
You need to visit our forums.

1935
02:50:02,960 --> 02:50:07,560
They're at calibomani.com slash NBOR3.

1936
02:50:07,560 --> 02:50:09,560
Or you know what, even quicker?

1937
02:50:09,560 --> 02:50:12,720
Just go to calibomani.com and then click on forums.

1938
02:50:12,720 --> 02:50:13,720
Awesome.

1939
02:50:13,720 --> 02:50:16,320
Or go to the Orange Lounge website and click on forums.

1940
02:50:16,320 --> 02:50:20,120
They go to the same place, visit the forums, post, they're the best damn forums anywhere.

1941
02:50:20,120 --> 02:50:21,120
They're good.

1942
02:50:21,120 --> 02:50:23,440
Except for the Gold Club Centerfolds forums, which are better.

1943
02:50:23,440 --> 02:50:24,440
Oh my gosh.

1944
02:50:24,440 --> 02:50:26,440
That's a strip club, by the way.

1945
02:50:26,440 --> 02:50:33,320
If they get so much more activity on the forums, I'm like, what are you doing posting on a

1946
02:50:33,320 --> 02:50:34,440
forum about a strip club?

1947
02:50:34,440 --> 02:50:39,080
How sad is that that people just constantly visit strip clubs, then they go post about

1948
02:50:39,080 --> 02:50:40,080
it on a forum.

1949
02:50:40,080 --> 02:50:42,880
I'll tell you what else is funny, the Gold Club Centerfolds forum, which is a strip bar

1950
02:50:42,880 --> 02:50:56,880
I would also like to plug Neopets.com. Go there, earn lots of Neopoints, and give them

1951
02:50:56,880 --> 02:50:57,880
to me.

1952
02:50:57,880 --> 02:51:03,480
Snub Dispenoid would like to say, Paranoid survivor MaxoniSteps has a max combo of 641

1953
02:51:03,480 --> 02:51:07,240
and has slides inside the final runs. How the hell can anyone pass that? Just thought

1954
02:51:07,240 --> 02:51:08,240
I would share slash ask.

1955
02:51:08,240 --> 02:51:10,240
This is not Ask Orange Lounge.

1956
02:51:10,240 --> 02:51:12,240
Yes, this is NASCAR. I'm sorry

1957
02:51:14,320 --> 02:51:19,200
Because slowly over time playing DVR you will slowly become Asian

1958
02:51:20,120 --> 02:51:26,640
Once you've achieved the ultimate Asian status, you will be able to pass that song but only then

1959
02:51:27,320 --> 02:51:31,480
Will you be able to pass that song and not before then the machine must choose you

1960
02:51:32,080 --> 02:51:34,360
Then you'll become the last starfighter

1961
02:51:34,360 --> 02:51:40,440
Japan Man wants me to plug a site that's like a two-year-old internet joke, so when you

1962
02:51:40,440 --> 02:51:49,440
find something funny that's new, let me know, because Goat Sei is like two years old, okay?

1963
02:51:49,440 --> 02:51:54,880
Dark Tetsuya says that look out for his DWI for love and the angel, it's in the making.

1964
02:51:54,880 --> 02:51:56,960
And will he be hosting that on Leech and Wookie?

1965
02:51:56,960 --> 02:51:57,960
Who knows?

1966
02:51:57,960 --> 02:51:58,960
I hope so.

1967
02:51:58,960 --> 02:52:03,040
Yeah, that's another thing about my site, pretty soon it's going to be really easy to

1968
02:52:03,040 --> 02:52:08,800
upload files, like, really, really, really easy. So, yeah.

1969
02:52:08,800 --> 02:52:14,120
Okay, morethanjake543 says, I need someone to do something that will make Rio shut down

1970
02:52:14,120 --> 02:52:21,120
for a day. That's his school. Oh, ratemyhuck.com. Uh-oh, I'm scared to know what a huck is.

1971
02:52:21,120 --> 02:52:23,600
I don't know what a huck is. Let's see what a huck is.

1972
02:52:23,600 --> 02:52:26,480
Is that like a pecker? I don't know. Let's find out. I hope so.

1973
02:52:26,480 --> 02:52:31,280
Is that a cog? It's a cog. Let's see, we're going to ratemyhuck. I wonder

1974
02:52:31,280 --> 02:52:32,280
I wonder if it's vomit.

1975
02:52:32,280 --> 02:52:33,280
Hux kind of sounds like vomit.

1976
02:52:33,280 --> 02:52:38,120
No, because I'm going to rate my huck.

1977
02:52:38,120 --> 02:52:39,120
Here it is.

1978
02:52:39,120 --> 02:52:40,600
It's a Norwegian thing.

1979
02:52:40,600 --> 02:52:43,200
If this is poop or something, I'm going to be pissed.

1980
02:52:43,200 --> 02:52:45,080
Oh, it's biking.

1981
02:52:45,080 --> 02:52:46,080
Okay.

1982
02:52:46,080 --> 02:52:47,080
Okay.

1983
02:52:47,080 --> 02:52:48,080
Alright.

1984
02:52:48,080 --> 02:52:49,080
Okay.

1985
02:52:49,080 --> 02:52:50,080
That I can do.

1986
02:52:50,080 --> 02:52:51,080
That I can deal with.

1987
02:52:51,080 --> 02:52:52,080
Rate my...

1988
02:52:52,080 --> 02:52:53,080
Do they have RateMyCock.com?

1989
02:52:53,080 --> 02:52:55,600
It's like a bicycle thing.

1990
02:52:55,600 --> 02:52:56,600
Okay.

1991
02:52:56,600 --> 02:52:57,600
That's fine.

1992
02:52:57,600 --> 02:52:58,600
RateMyHuck is acceptable.

1993
02:52:58,600 --> 02:52:59,600
Rob, see if they have RateMyCock.

1994
02:52:59,600 --> 02:53:17,600
ratemycock.com

1995
02:53:17,600 --> 02:53:23,300
Okay, let's see. We're going to enter.

1996
02:53:23,300 --> 02:53:26,100
There is a RaidMyCock.com.

1997
02:53:26,100 --> 02:53:30,400
Uh, yeah!

1998
02:53:30,400 --> 02:53:32,200
What do you guys think?

1999
02:53:32,200 --> 02:53:35,700
I still think that the penis is the funniest looking thing in the world.

2000
02:53:35,700 --> 02:53:38,200
Praise God for internet porn.

2001
02:53:38,200 --> 02:53:42,000
I would give that, oh, I'd say about a five on size.

2002
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:43,500
Style?

2003
02:53:43,500 --> 02:53:45,000
No, okay, I'll give it a seven.

2004
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:50,000
Okay, let's go to the next cock. Let's look at the next one.

2005
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:55,000
Okay, we're going to look at one more cock, then we're done.

2006
02:53:55,000 --> 02:54:00,000
They have their name, and then they have the cock.

2007
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:05,000
Oh, I want him.

2008
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:10,000
Okay, you have to log in to vote, and I'm not going to log in.

2009
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:13,000
I don't know if you want to rape people's cock.

2010
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:14,000
This is great.

2011
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:17,320
The greatest thing about the site, even if you're straight, this is funny.

2012
02:54:17,320 --> 02:54:20,720
I swear, if you're a straight guy, this is still funny because it has their name and

2013
02:54:20,720 --> 02:54:21,720
then their cock's name.

2014
02:54:21,720 --> 02:54:23,720
That is so photoshopped, okay?

2015
02:54:23,720 --> 02:54:27,120
God, I hope the neighbors aren't listening.

2016
02:54:27,120 --> 02:54:28,120
More plugging.

2017
02:54:28,120 --> 02:54:36,760
Sautome Ron Mo would like to plug www.starmen.net as well as my huge, huge penis.

2018
02:54:36,760 --> 02:54:38,760
How many Neopoints do you need, Jamie?

2019
02:54:38,760 --> 02:54:42,760
I'm actually about 30,000 away from my next bank account.

2020
02:54:42,760 --> 02:54:44,760
I'll take whatever I can get.

2021
02:54:44,760 --> 02:54:48,760
My Neopets name is DJ underscore Celica.

2022
02:54:48,760 --> 02:54:53,760
Yes, we got a lot of cool new listeners from Starman.net, so go visit them.

2023
02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:57,760
Especially if you like Earthbound, which you should because it was the greatest Super Nintendo game ever.

2024
02:54:57,760 --> 02:55:02,760
23rd Magus would like to plug Pi, American Pi style.

2025
02:55:02,760 --> 02:55:08,760
We don't need to know about your secret nighttime activities involving pies.

2026
02:55:08,760 --> 02:55:13,760
And Rice would like to... This is the greatest site. Okay, in all seriousness, this is the greatest site.

2027
02:55:13,760 --> 02:55:18,760
Rice is having us plug the greatest site. RYC3 would like us to plug RateMyKitten.com.

2028
02:55:18,760 --> 02:55:22,760
It is the cutest site. No, let's go. Let's go. Let's visit it. Let's visit it. Okay.

2029
02:55:22,760 --> 02:55:24,760
I should put pictures of Shermie on there.

2030
02:55:24,760 --> 02:55:27,760
Let's visit. It's pussy that's actually good!

2031
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:33,760
I want to see more kitties!

2032
02:55:33,760 --> 02:55:37,760
I love doing this because all I...you just hear this be ahhh!

2033
02:55:37,760 --> 02:55:38,760
I want to see more kitties!

2034
02:55:38,760 --> 02:55:39,760
We're like one big girl.

2035
02:55:39,760 --> 02:55:41,760
Okay, what do we rate this kitten?

2036
02:55:41,760 --> 02:55:42,760
He has the cans up the kitten's ass.

2037
02:55:42,760 --> 02:55:43,760
Yeah, he has the cans up the kitten's ass.

2038
02:55:43,760 --> 02:55:44,760
Okay, here's another kitten.

2039
02:55:44,760 --> 02:55:45,760
Okay, here's another kitten.

2040
02:55:45,760 --> 02:55:46,760
Ahhhh!

2041
02:55:46,760 --> 02:55:54,760
Yes, I like doing this just for the sound effects, okay?

2042
02:55:54,760 --> 02:55:55,760
This is great radio.

2043
02:55:55,760 --> 02:56:02,760
radio. This Indian's home has dinner already for tonight. Okay, okay, one more just for

2044
02:56:02,760 --> 02:56:10,760
the sound effect. Here we go. Ready? One more just for the sound effect. That one looked

2045
02:56:10,760 --> 02:56:14,760
kind of mean, so it didn't get quite the reaction we were hoping for. Okay, let's try this.

2046
02:56:14,760 --> 02:56:24,760
Okay, it's getting old. Okay. Okay. Okay, go to this side. All right, Rob. Okay, okay,

2047
02:56:24,760 --> 02:56:39,760
This is my cat, who owns all cats.

2048
02:56:39,760 --> 02:56:43,760
This is Shermy sleeping in a pizza box.

2049
02:56:43,760 --> 02:56:49,760
Shermy is a big cat. You've got to realize that when this cat is standing up and walking around, it looks like a soccer ball.

2050
02:56:49,760 --> 02:56:51,760
But Shermy is cute.

2051
02:56:51,760 --> 02:56:56,760
Very cute, very cuddly, very nice, very sweet and all that. But oh my god, I have never seen a cat get so big.

2052
02:56:56,760 --> 02:57:02,760
It's because she doesn't do anything but lay around. I tried to chase her back and forth to make her hop over my legs, chasing the feather.

2053
02:57:02,760 --> 02:57:06,760
And then she sat down and was like, you can be the feather to me, bitch.

2054
02:57:06,760 --> 02:57:09,760
That's my baby. Isn't she cute?

2055
02:57:09,760 --> 02:57:17,760
And by the way, you'll also see a few neat things in the background, like a 32X and an activator.

2056
02:57:17,760 --> 02:57:19,760
Some of Jamie's toys.

2057
02:57:19,760 --> 02:57:23,760
And you're a keyboard mania controller.

2058
02:57:23,760 --> 02:57:30,760
Okay, uh, me and my friend were playing Vice City His Place. Then what happens? He starts firing at some cops when this black man just jumps on the bike.

2059
02:57:30,760 --> 02:57:33,760
I think he came from this hole.

2060
02:57:33,760 --> 02:57:34,760
What?

2061
02:57:34,760 --> 02:57:38,760
So, he found a man whore in Vice City, I guess. It's like some big deal.

2062
02:57:38,760 --> 02:57:40,760
Huh.

2063
02:57:40,760 --> 02:57:42,760
That's beautiful.

2064
02:57:42,760 --> 02:57:43,760
Wow.

2065
02:57:43,760 --> 02:57:50,760
More thanjake would like us to plug collegehumor.com and mycathateyou.com

2066
02:57:50,760 --> 02:57:52,760
Ooh, the other side of it. Let's see, let's have a look at it.

2067
02:57:52,760 --> 02:57:55,760
mycathateyou.com

2068
02:57:55,760 --> 02:57:58,760
How's the mean little kitty?

2069
02:57:58,760 --> 02:57:59,760
Oh no!

2070
02:57:59,760 --> 02:58:01,760
I've seen that picture over e-mail.

2071
02:58:01,760 --> 02:58:03,760
I know about that.

2072
02:58:03,760 --> 02:58:04,760
About the line.

2073
02:58:04,760 --> 02:58:06,760
Oh, these are all like, mean cats.

2074
02:58:06,760 --> 02:58:07,760
Oh, that's a cool one.

2075
02:58:07,760 --> 02:58:12,760
Okay, okay. This is an awesome site. It's, uh, hctp dot, alright, it's actually, um,

02:58:12,760 --> 02:58:18,760

2077
02:58:20,760 --> 02:58:21,760
Uh, oops.

2078
02:58:21,760 --> 02:58:22,760
No WWE.

2079
02:58:22,760 --> 02:58:23,760
No WWE.

2080
02:58:25,760 --> 02:58:26,760
Okay, here we go.

2081
02:58:27,760 --> 02:58:31,760
The best page in the universe. Oh, is this the one where he rips on the little kid's

2082
02:58:31,760 --> 02:58:32,760
arms and stuff?

2083
02:58:32,760 --> 02:58:34,760
Yeah, but he, there's much more of that. Let's see here.

2084
02:58:34,760 --> 02:58:39,760
Oh, who would make a better President Bush or a box of Tic Tacs?

2085
02:58:39,760 --> 02:58:41,760
That's beautiful.

2086
02:58:41,760 --> 02:58:43,760
Wait, wait, look at this picture. This is the best.

2087
02:58:43,760 --> 02:58:45,760
Um...

2088
02:58:45,760 --> 02:58:47,760
Oh, here we go.

2089
02:58:49,760 --> 02:58:51,760
Wonderful.

2090
02:58:51,760 --> 02:58:53,760
All right, so I'll, uh...

2091
02:58:53,760 --> 02:58:58,760
I'm gonna post that to the chat room if they'd like to check out that little ball of joy.

2092
02:58:58,760 --> 02:59:03,760
Let's see what, uh, Sharkscroll wanted us to plug.

2093
02:59:03,760 --> 02:59:08,760
Oh, she says to tell Jamie that I will send her, Shermie, and horse pics.

2094
02:59:08,760 --> 02:59:09,760
Very cool.

2095
02:59:09,760 --> 02:59:13,760
Yes, go ahead and email that to me so I can have my tiger horsey.

2096
02:59:13,760 --> 02:59:16,760
Callie Bamani wants us to plug topromin.com.

2097
02:59:16,760 --> 02:59:17,760
It's a porn site.

2098
02:59:17,760 --> 02:59:18,760
Is it?

2099
02:59:18,760 --> 02:59:20,760
I wouldn't have guessed.

2100
02:59:20,760 --> 02:59:21,760
I like it.

2101
02:59:21,760 --> 02:59:23,760
I like porn.

2102
02:59:23,760 --> 02:59:24,760
Matt's saying, I like ramen.

2103
02:59:24,760 --> 02:59:26,760
I like porn.

2104
02:59:26,760 --> 02:59:28,760
Okay, it is a porn site.

2105
02:59:28,760 --> 02:59:29,760
Beautiful.

2106
02:59:29,760 --> 02:59:45,760
I would also like to plug cospa.co.jp for any cosplayers, it's a site that sells pre-made cosplay pieces, but also it's very good images on things that you can make for your own costumes.

2107
02:59:45,760 --> 02:59:53,760
And also tokyostreets.com for anyone who's into the whole fruits fashion, it has pictures of street fashion in Tokyo.

2108
02:59:53,760 --> 02:59:57,760
Okay, 23rd Magus would like a way to plug my BWC.

2109
02:59:58,760 --> 02:59:59,760
Big white cock?

2110
02:59:59,760 --> 03:00:00,760
I don't know.

2111
03:00:00,760 --> 03:00:01,760
Okay.

2112
03:00:01,760 --> 03:00:03,760
These are the last plugs, you guys, and we're going to end the show.

2113
03:00:03,760 --> 03:00:05,760
Get the final thoughts, end the show.

2114
03:00:05,760 --> 03:00:08,760
Brack2000 wants to plug emotioneric.com.

2115
03:00:08,760 --> 03:00:09,760
Yes, this site is very cool.

2116
03:00:09,760 --> 03:00:10,760
Thank you.

2117
03:00:10,760 --> 03:00:11,760
Thank you for plugging this.

2118
03:00:11,760 --> 03:00:12,760
This is a great site.

2119
03:00:12,760 --> 03:00:18,760
This is this guy, and all he does is he emotes things.

2120
03:00:18,760 --> 03:00:19,760
So let me show you.

2121
03:00:19,760 --> 03:00:20,760
Like here.

2122
03:00:20,760 --> 03:00:22,760
God damn, these fucking pop-up ads.

2123
03:00:22,760 --> 03:00:27,960
all

2124
03:00:27,960 --> 03:00:30,720
for love

2125
03:00:30,720 --> 03:00:33,560
mode icon for drunk

2126
03:00:33,560 --> 03:00:37,960
and then we get to like kill number three

2127
03:00:37,960 --> 03:00:41,080
finding dead body in the trunk

2128
03:00:41,080 --> 03:00:42,120
but

2129
03:00:42,120 --> 03:00:46,160
uh... freedom

2130
03:00:46,160 --> 03:00:50,680
so you motion eric dot com great uh... many as pending requests

2131
03:00:50,680 --> 03:00:53,840
he also takes requests like yoga, fire, and things like that.

2132
03:00:53,840 --> 03:00:57,040
Okay, uh, what is the request?

2133
03:00:57,040 --> 03:00:58,000
Home Star Runner!

2134
03:00:58,000 --> 03:00:59,760
Rise Princess, Home Star Runner.

2135
03:00:59,760 --> 03:01:00,880
Yes!

2136
03:01:00,880 --> 03:01:03,040
I'm sure everybody on the internet has seen that.

2137
03:01:03,040 --> 03:01:05,560
Alrighty, late late, ending late, yeah big deal.

2138
03:01:05,560 --> 03:01:08,000
So what, it's our show.

2139
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:12,600
Oh, Cali Bamani says, I would never go to a site like that, Sean found it.

2140
03:01:12,600 --> 03:01:16,200
Sure.

2141
03:01:16,200 --> 03:01:20,360
Alright, that's it, we got all the plugs in, so

2142
03:01:20,360 --> 03:01:22,360
Thank you for helping to participate.

2143
03:01:22,360 --> 03:01:30,360
I want Loki to read on air the article Maddox wrote about vegetarianism for morals on the Maddox.xmission.com.

2144
03:01:30,360 --> 03:01:32,360
You up for it?

2145
03:01:32,360 --> 03:01:34,360
I've read all of his articles, so...

2146
03:01:34,360 --> 03:01:36,360
Where's the vegetarian one?

2147
03:01:36,360 --> 03:01:38,360
Let me find it.

2148
03:01:38,360 --> 03:01:41,360
That's the continuity one with Daredevil, the movie.

2149
03:01:41,360 --> 03:01:43,360
Let's see here.

2150
03:01:43,360 --> 03:01:45,360
Oh, this one's funny too, but I'm not going to read that one.

2151
03:01:45,360 --> 03:01:48,360
PETA, preventing suffering.

2152
03:01:48,360 --> 03:01:52,360
Wait, that's hate mail, I think.

2153
03:01:52,360 --> 03:01:55,360
That might be the one.

2154
03:01:55,360 --> 03:01:59,360
It's about the guiltless grill.

2155
03:01:59,360 --> 03:02:01,360
Make it quick, we've got to end the show.

2156
03:02:01,360 --> 03:02:02,360
Long fucking article.

2157
03:02:02,360 --> 03:02:03,360
First paragraph.

2158
03:02:03,360 --> 03:02:07,360
PETA stands for People Before the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

2159
03:02:07,360 --> 03:02:09,360
Let's ignore that for a moment.

2160
03:02:09,360 --> 03:02:12,360
That implies that there exists a universal set of ethics

2161
03:02:12,360 --> 03:02:15,360
instead of let's focus on the meat of this email.

2162
03:02:15,360 --> 03:02:18,660
that is primarily concerned with preventing and suffering of living animals.

2163
03:02:18,660 --> 03:02:19,660
Oh really?

2164
03:02:19,660 --> 03:02:22,420
As opposed to preventing and suffering of dead animals?

2165
03:02:22,420 --> 03:02:26,500
Good thing they clarified that because I was confused and couldn't infer that they were

2166
03:02:26,500 --> 03:02:30,660
saying animals that they didn't mean dead animals.

2167
03:02:30,660 --> 03:02:31,660
Glad we have cleared that up.

2168
03:02:31,660 --> 03:02:32,660
Let's move on.

2169
03:02:32,660 --> 03:02:33,660
Alright, that's enough.

2170
03:02:33,660 --> 03:02:37,700
Anyways, to basically summarize that, he's just telling that more animals get killed

2171
03:02:37,700 --> 03:02:40,300
in the harvesting of grain than by a sin.

2172
03:02:40,300 --> 03:02:46,300
So what he says is, for every one piece of, like, or every steak that they're not going to eat, he's going to eat three.

2173
03:02:46,300 --> 03:02:49,300
That's awful.

2174
03:02:49,300 --> 03:02:52,300
All right.

2175
03:02:52,300 --> 03:02:59,300
And I'm getting asked to play the second song that JB sent me, which I will do after the show is over.

2176
03:02:59,300 --> 03:03:01,300
So, let's get to those final thoughts.

2177
03:03:01,300 --> 03:03:04,300
Guess first. Zero?

2178
03:03:04,300 --> 03:03:05,300
Is he here?

2179
03:03:05,300 --> 03:03:06,300
Somewhere, he's hiding.

2180
03:03:06,300 --> 03:03:07,300
No, I ran away.

2181
03:03:07,300 --> 03:03:20,300
No, um, I guess my final thought is pretty much, um, yeah, have as many parties as you possibly can because they're really fun and you can get drunk and you can make an ass out of yourself.

2182
03:03:25,300 --> 03:03:28,300
I have to say in that motion, ass is good but then so is boobs.

2183
03:03:31,300 --> 03:03:35,300
Um, okay, I don't think you said ass is good and so are boobs.

2184
03:03:35,300 --> 03:03:41,300
I'm sorry, let me clarify. Ass is good, and so is booze. That's an alcohol.

2185
03:03:41,300 --> 03:03:48,300
Okay, glad we clarified that. My final thought? Be happy. That's all I got to say.

2186
03:03:48,300 --> 03:03:52,300
My final thought is black CDRs are really red.

2187
03:03:52,300 --> 03:04:04,300
Vegetarians suck. You should eat all the meat that's possible, otherwise cows go to waste. You care to counter that?

2188
03:04:04,300 --> 03:04:11,300
That sucks.

2189
03:04:11,300 --> 03:04:15,300
For those of you who don't know, I am a vegetarian.

2190
03:04:15,300 --> 03:04:19,300
I don't eat cows or pigs because I don't want a heart attack.

2191
03:04:19,300 --> 03:04:21,300
I say we just eat the vegetarians.

2192
03:04:21,300 --> 03:04:24,300
I say we kill you and waste your meat.

2193
03:04:24,300 --> 03:04:26,300
Cannibalism.

2194
03:04:26,300 --> 03:04:29,300
I could go into this, it's just too long.

2195
03:04:29,300 --> 03:04:31,300
And then we trap your soul and make you watch your body rot.

2196
03:04:31,300 --> 03:04:34,300
Let's see, salad or BEEF!

2197
03:04:34,300 --> 03:04:35,300
How's that?

2198
03:04:35,300 --> 03:04:36,300
Beef it is!

2199
03:04:36,300 --> 03:04:38,300
Sausage is always good for me.

2200
03:04:38,300 --> 03:04:41,300
Stop it with the gay references!

2201
03:04:41,300 --> 03:04:44,300
Did everybody get to do the final thought except me?

2202
03:04:44,300 --> 03:04:48,300
Well, I want to know if Loki would kill his own cow to get his beef.

2203
03:04:48,300 --> 03:04:50,300
Oh damn, that'd be fun!

2204
03:04:50,300 --> 03:04:53,300
It's all, oof, oof, oof, oof, oof!

2205
03:04:53,300 --> 03:05:00,300
In reference to that, Dennis Leary did have the funniest thing regarding being pro meat eating.

2206
03:05:00,300 --> 03:05:04,300
and that was, bring out a live cow, I'll carve off what I want and ride the rest home.

2207
03:05:04,300 --> 03:05:11,300
And if one of the meat eaters had a heart attack and fell over, we'd just throw him in the pit too. More meat for the meat eaters!

2208
03:05:11,300 --> 03:05:18,300
I wouldn't kill my cow, I would get a guy cow and make them have more cows, and then I would kill them and eat them.

2209
03:05:18,300 --> 03:05:24,300
Beautiful. My final thought for the day is, uh, Kuntai. Good night!

2210
03:05:24,300 --> 03:05:29,740

2215

Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

2216
03:05:59,860 --> 03:06:03,300
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.

2217

2221
03:06:21,220 --> 03:06:26,220
Man, don't think of any of you cruisin' down here to check out this ride.

2222
03:06:26,220 --> 03:06:28,220
The Emperor's coming here?

2223
03:06:28,220 --> 03:06:31,220
Yeah, and he gonna put a cap in your white ass.

2224
