1
00:00:01,791 --> 00:00:02,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Message for you, son!

2
00:00:03,112 --> 00:00:03,973
[SPEAKER_12]: Attention!

3
00:00:04,974 --> 00:00:08,859
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,506
[SPEAKER_09]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

5
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:22,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

6
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:25,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

7
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:28,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

9
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:33,503
[SPEAKER_18]: Just kidding.

10
00:00:33,703 --> 00:00:35,305
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

11
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:42,770
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode... Hey, are there any boys down there?

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,152
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest fairy you ever seen, Jingle Fairy?

13
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:46,993
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your favorite scary movie?

14
00:00:48,428 --> 00:00:49,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Showgirls.

15
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:51,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolute fright.

16
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,131
[SPEAKER_11]: What's yours?

17
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:54,613
[SPEAKER_11]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

18
00:00:54,673 --> 00:00:56,554
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't torture yourself.

19
00:00:56,574 --> 00:00:57,394
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my job.

20
00:00:57,495 --> 00:01:00,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Now's the time on Sprocket's going to be dogs!

21
00:01:00,657 --> 00:01:03,979
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too.

22
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:05,320
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Kung Fu.

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,062
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

24
00:01:08,322 --> 00:01:10,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Why did they have to take the word day?

25
00:01:11,665 --> 00:01:14,327
[SPEAKER_10]: No one expects a Spanish exposition.

26
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:15,387
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Kendo.

27
00:01:15,467 --> 00:01:15,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey!

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,043
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio,

29
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:42,166
[SPEAKER_18]: We are live and this is episode number 37 for March 9th.

30
00:01:42,306 --> 00:01:43,067
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's not the 9th.

31
00:01:43,107 --> 00:01:44,869
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the 16th of 2003.

32
00:01:45,029 --> 00:01:46,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob's doing the time warp again.

33
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:47,312
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello.

34
00:01:47,693 --> 00:01:52,498
[SPEAKER_18]: You're tuned into the Mamani Scene's most buzzing radio station of all things Mamani.

35
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:53,920
[SPEAKER_18]: My name is Rob Roberts.

36
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,041
[SPEAKER_18]: You might know me as Sky.

37
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,781
[SPEAKER_18]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.

38
00:01:57,801 --> 00:02:00,222
[SPEAKER_18]: In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers.

39
00:02:00,262 --> 00:02:01,522
[SPEAKER_18]: You know her better as DarkSakura.

40
00:02:01,562 --> 00:02:02,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not happy.

41
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:04,843
[SPEAKER_18]: In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

42
00:02:05,143 --> 00:02:05,423
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello.

43
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:10,044
[SPEAKER_18]: And with us here also in the studio tonight, we have... Here!

44
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:10,704
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody!

45
00:02:11,084 --> 00:02:12,124
[SPEAKER_18]: This is amazing!

46
00:02:12,504 --> 00:02:14,125
[SPEAKER_18]: There is nobody else here tonight.

47
00:02:14,205 --> 00:02:15,425
[SPEAKER_18]: It is just the three of us.

48
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:16,565
[SPEAKER_18]: This is craziness.

49
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:18,045
[SPEAKER_18]: Zero's not even here.

50
00:02:18,065 --> 00:02:18,926
[SPEAKER_18]: He was supposed to be here tonight.

51
00:02:19,366 --> 00:02:20,346
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I guess.

52
00:02:20,746 --> 00:02:20,846
[SPEAKER_18]: And...

53
00:02:21,926 --> 00:02:23,487
[SPEAKER_18]: Brad and Irene said they were going to be here tonight.

54
00:02:23,647 --> 00:02:25,787
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to make our intern do something really crazy.

55
00:02:25,907 --> 00:02:27,188
[SPEAKER_18]: That is messed up.

56
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:29,288
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's just us here feeling the love.

57
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:33,330
[SPEAKER_18]: But we also have the mic, microphone, making lots of noise to entertain us.

58
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,170
[SPEAKER_18]: We apologize.

59
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,291
[SPEAKER_18]: We know we have a really badly buzzing microphone.

60
00:02:36,311 --> 00:02:37,531
[SPEAKER_18]: We're doing what we can about it.

61
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,672
[SPEAKER_18]: But we really don't know.

62
00:02:39,712 --> 00:02:40,652
[SPEAKER_18]: We're kind of out of options.

63
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:43,273
[SPEAKER_18]: We've rearranged the whole room here.

64
00:02:43,673 --> 00:02:45,753
[SPEAKER_18]: And we think the subwoofer might be contributing to it.

65
00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:47,214
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think this...

66
00:02:47,694 --> 00:02:48,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine does that.

67
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:53,540
[SPEAKER_18]: I can turn off the subwoofer, and then we won't hear anything, but I think they still get the buzzing even with the subwoofers off.

68
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:55,682
[SPEAKER_18]: But, I don't know.

69
00:02:56,202 --> 00:02:58,925
[SPEAKER_18]: So, life sucks, and you'll just have to bear with us tonight.

70
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,026
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll do what we can.

71
00:03:02,108 --> 00:03:05,411
[SPEAKER_18]: But in the meantime, we're going to play some break songs.

72
00:03:05,832 --> 00:03:07,213
[SPEAKER_18]: And what songs are we going to hear this break?

73
00:03:07,273 --> 00:03:08,594
[SPEAKER_04]: These are songs that no one listens to.

74
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:11,277
[SPEAKER_18]: These are songs that no one listens to, but you're going to now, so enjoy.

75
00:03:11,537 --> 00:03:11,958
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be back.

76
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Check one, check one, when I come down, I come down right to the sun.

77
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:20,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Get right down, get right down to the gym.

78
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:21,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Round and round.

79
00:03:40,883 --> 00:03:43,145
I'm a friend of the best Who's in the juice?

80
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,561
L-O-V-E-N-S L-O-V-E-N-S

81
00:09:32,076 --> 00:09:32,496
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello?

82
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:33,558
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello?

83
00:09:33,598 --> 00:09:34,298
[SPEAKER_18]: Is this thing on?

84
00:09:34,358 --> 00:09:34,859
[SPEAKER_18]: Testing.

85
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,901
[SPEAKER_18]: Testing 1-2.

86
00:09:37,482 --> 00:09:41,426
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

87
00:09:41,526 --> 00:09:42,006
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello?

88
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,129
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't understand this.

89
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:45,510
[SPEAKER_18]: Does this thing work?

90
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,132
[SPEAKER_06]: This thing reads like stereo instructions.

91
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:47,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this on?

92
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:49,494
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell?

93
00:09:50,836 --> 00:09:52,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio.

94
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:54,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Broke down Get Open Body Radio.

95
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:02,945
Yeah, hello!

96
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:18,380
Thank you for watching!

97
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:53,418
Thank you for watching!

98
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,861
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, enough of that.

99
00:11:02,702 --> 00:11:04,183
[SPEAKER_18]: We were supposed to be back before that was over.

100
00:11:04,223 --> 00:11:05,544
[SPEAKER_18]: Apologies about that.

101
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:06,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that irony or what?

102
00:11:07,205 --> 00:11:10,768
[SPEAKER_18]: That, you know, broke down ghetto-ass radio and then we can't even get our fucking volume.

103
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:11,548
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't get it up.

104
00:11:11,568 --> 00:11:12,989
[SPEAKER_06]: We're impotent.

105
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:23,077
[SPEAKER_18]: We actually, what's funny is that during the break I was trying to fix the buzzing problem we've got tonight and I went behind the computer and kind of unplugged the splitter because Loki said, hey, look at the splitter.

106
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:23,898
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe something's wrong with that.

107
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:26,900
[SPEAKER_18]: And lo and behold, I went and I plugged it back in the wrong hole.

108
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:29,182
[SPEAKER_18]: I stuck it in the wrong hole.

109
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:33,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Rob, do you have whole priorities here?

110
00:11:34,163 --> 00:11:35,264
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I have whole problems.

111
00:11:35,405 --> 00:11:36,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm dyslexic!

112
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:45,614
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, in that break of Little Played Bomani songs, pretty controversial in the chatroom, because every time one of them would play something, we'd go, hey, I'd play that.

113
00:11:47,196 --> 00:11:49,418
[SPEAKER_06]: How many people really play Minimalian?

114
00:11:49,478 --> 00:11:49,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

115
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:56,924
[SPEAKER_18]: We had Chiang Ma with Love This Feelin' and then Minimalin from 4th Style, which was also the background music in 3rd Style, if I'm not mistaken.

116
00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:58,805
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I think so.

117
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:03,588
[SPEAKER_18]: And then after that, the Sampling Masters with Tablets from 5th Style.

118
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:08,270
[SPEAKER_18]: And then Usama Kubota with Presto, which is somewhat debatable because actually a lot of people play that song.

119
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,132
[SPEAKER_18]: But what happened is I was actually looking for 5 Regrets and I couldn't find it.

120
00:12:12,752 --> 00:12:18,375
[SPEAKER_18]: So then I tried to find, I was going to put 1989 in, but a lot of people would have beat me up if I played 1989.

121
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:19,396
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually kind of like it.

122
00:12:21,132 --> 00:12:23,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have played Entrance.

123
00:12:23,473 --> 00:12:25,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was the one I was trying to think of, I think.

124
00:12:25,294 --> 00:12:25,675
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay!

125
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:46,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Every Kubota song could have been in Keyboard Mania.

126
00:12:46,486 --> 00:12:47,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Presto was.

127
00:12:47,287 --> 00:12:47,808
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, Presto was.

128
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:56,863
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, you are listening to Orange House Radio, and again, we apologize for having some buzzing issues tonight.

129
00:12:56,903 --> 00:12:57,964
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't know what's causing it.

130
00:12:58,024 --> 00:13:00,265
[SPEAKER_18]: We've dissected everything going on.

131
00:13:00,285 --> 00:13:05,427
[SPEAKER_18]: About the only way I think I'd be able to... The bee is angry for, you know, you defacing its song.

132
00:13:07,048 --> 00:13:09,069
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I don't know what we can do about it.

133
00:13:09,229 --> 00:13:10,930
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll just have to bear with it tonight.

134
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,650
[SPEAKER_18]: Although it has been worse in the past.

135
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,832
[SPEAKER_18]: The one episode we did, it was just unbearable almost, but we did it anyway.

136
00:13:17,473 --> 00:13:19,774
[SPEAKER_18]: And you guys stuck with us because you love us, and we love you.

137
00:13:21,094 --> 00:13:28,041
[SPEAKER_18]: You were funny last night, you were drunk You were drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk Giggling and then I fell asleep

138
00:13:39,102 --> 00:13:50,170
[SPEAKER_18]: Last night, Zero, the Orange Lounge intern, had a little get-together at his house, and we decided to do a little bit of drinking, because it was mostly older folks that were there, over 21, so we decided to bust out a little bit of liquor.

139
00:13:51,211 --> 00:13:53,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I had my one triple shot of that imported tequila.

140
00:13:54,214 --> 00:13:56,335
[SPEAKER_18]: I had about half a glass of Aftershock.

141
00:13:56,856 --> 00:13:58,417
[SPEAKER_18]: Not a shot, but half a glass.

142
00:13:58,577 --> 00:14:00,238
[SPEAKER_18]: I had half a glass of Aftershock.

143
00:14:00,258 --> 00:14:02,540
[SPEAKER_06]: I had whatever it was that Irene made me.

144
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,621
[SPEAKER_06]: It was yummy.

145
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,624
[SPEAKER_18]: Irene knew what I'd been needing for about the past year, and Irene made me a cocksucker.

146
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:11,457
[SPEAKER_18]: Which is Irish cream mixed with butterscotch schnapps.

147
00:14:11,937 --> 00:14:13,637
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, she didn't make me a shot.

148
00:14:13,718 --> 00:14:14,898
[SPEAKER_18]: It's supposed to be a shot drink.

149
00:14:15,818 --> 00:14:17,158
[SPEAKER_18]: I was made a full glass.

150
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:18,499
[SPEAKER_06]: That was yummy though.

151
00:14:18,739 --> 00:14:21,460
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, and I drank just about the whole thing except for a couple sips.

152
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,861
[SPEAKER_18]: So needless to say, after half a glass of Aftershock and that, I was pretty fucked up.

153
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:29,602
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I don't know, I was running around the house yelling things.

154
00:14:29,722 --> 00:14:30,882
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what I was doing when I was drunk.

155
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:31,322
[SPEAKER_06]: I fell asleep.

156
00:14:31,943 --> 00:14:33,563
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I fell asleep too after my mouth.

157
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,084
[SPEAKER_18]: It took like about 45 minutes and that was it.

158
00:14:36,904 --> 00:14:37,844
[SPEAKER_18]: Was that how long I was awake?

159
00:14:37,864 --> 00:14:38,745
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't long at all.

160
00:14:38,865 --> 00:14:40,425
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like, the rub's drunk.

161
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:41,505
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like, already?

162
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,426
[SPEAKER_17]: Shit, man.

163
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:45,687
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't even finish setting up the pads yet and you're already drunk.

164
00:14:45,707 --> 00:14:46,667
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, wait a minute.

165
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:47,447
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait a minute.

166
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,928
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not because you guys ran to the store.

167
00:14:53,469 --> 00:14:55,470
[SPEAKER_18]: Poor Ice Queen spent a bunch on liquor.

168
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,870
[SPEAKER_18]: Which reminds me, he's not here and he's supposed to be.

169
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,611
[SPEAKER_18]: I need to call him and see where he's at.

170
00:15:00,262 --> 00:15:01,003
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

171
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:18,430
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you want to talk about tournament while I call Matt?

172
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,533
[SPEAKER_17]: There's nothing going on at all.

173
00:15:21,793 --> 00:15:23,094
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just dead.

174
00:15:23,254 --> 00:15:25,276
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been like this for like the last three months.

175
00:15:25,896 --> 00:15:27,498
[SPEAKER_17]: Nothing is happening.

176
00:15:27,738 --> 00:15:29,119
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, March Madness isn't for two weeks.

177
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,722
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I mean, we can talk about that next week because nothing's going to happen next week anyways.

178
00:15:34,423 --> 00:15:34,783
[SPEAKER_17]: One ringy dingy?

179
00:15:34,823 --> 00:15:35,644
[SPEAKER_17]: It's sad.

180
00:15:35,764 --> 00:15:36,505
[SPEAKER_17]: Nothing is happening.

181
00:15:36,525 --> 00:15:37,846
[SPEAKER_18]: Shit, it went out.

182
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:38,847
[SPEAKER_18]: My phone sucks in here.

183
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:40,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine got three bars.

184
00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:42,009
[SPEAKER_18]: You call Matt then.

185
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,750
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

186
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,371
[SPEAKER_06]: You can use my phone.

187
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:45,152
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

188
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:47,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob's gonna use my phone.

189
00:15:48,116 --> 00:15:49,578
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm gonna use the phone.

190
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:50,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go.

191
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,324
[SPEAKER_18]: What else is new in your sim this week, Matt, that we were all playing on last night?

192
00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:57,548
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, just more stuff I downloaded.

193
00:15:57,608 --> 00:16:00,812
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I've been trying to work on it, and...

194
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:06,658
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got up through 5th Mix all ready to go.

195
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:09,481
[SPEAKER_17]: It's ready for Monday.

196
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:10,762
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll probably upload this Monday.

197
00:16:11,222 --> 00:16:12,023
[SPEAKER_17]: Up through 5th Mix.

198
00:16:12,043 --> 00:16:14,245
[SPEAKER_17]: Pretty much everything you see in Bomani style right now.

199
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,330
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm trying to get Max and Max 2 done before tonight.

200
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:22,013
[SPEAKER_17]: Have those up and maybe some of everything else.

201
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:52,253
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I ran into some problems with the DDR Extreme files because not just one person's making them, but actually a whole bunch of different people are making them, and they're all out of sync, or just awful, and so I have to, like, you know, fix those too, and that sucks, and I don't really want to, and I probably won't, but yeah, there'll be more stuff, and you know what, I don't have, like, no, I don't have a hidden page this week because I'm lazy, and I just didn't get around to it, and you know what, I don't care.

202
00:16:54,274 --> 00:17:04,956
[SPEAKER_17]: and uh, oh shit man, I mean, well, oh, let's go to make, let's make a hidden page one sim file or uh, I don't know, I'll release like 300 tomorrow.

203
00:17:05,436 --> 00:17:07,096
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, decisions.

204
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:09,457
[SPEAKER_17]: So you can have the one or the 300.

205
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:10,397
[SPEAKER_17]: One.

206
00:17:12,817 --> 00:17:16,278
[SPEAKER_17]: Fine, that's all I'm, you know what sim file I'm gonna upload then?

207
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,798
[SPEAKER_17]: Let them move and that's it.

208
00:17:17,878 --> 00:17:18,378
[SPEAKER_17]: Yay.

209
00:17:18,518 --> 00:17:20,039
[SPEAKER_17]: Just to be the single sim file.

210
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:22,559
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, I don't know, I've got more stuff.

211
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,160
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

212
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,183
[SPEAKER_18]: Gosh, what else has been going on this week?

213
00:17:28,904 --> 00:17:32,907
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki and I are planning a move, and we decided on the apartment we want to go to.

214
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:34,988
[SPEAKER_18]: So the show's going to be moving.

215
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:39,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, we have an orgasming fountain at the new complex.

216
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:39,952
[SPEAKER_18]: Multiple orgasming.

217
00:17:40,012 --> 00:17:41,993
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's like a multiple orgasm fountain.

218
00:17:42,053 --> 00:17:46,456
[SPEAKER_18]: It flickers a little bit of water, then all of a sudden it's like, gush, gush, gush, and then back to a little bit.

219
00:17:49,258 --> 00:17:50,039
[SPEAKER_06]: I lost my job.

220
00:17:53,367 --> 00:18:10,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck Sierra Pacific Mortgage, there are 11,000 Olsen Drive, Rancho Cordova, California, Suite 202 Go there with a grenade launcher, aimed at the office of the shipping department Why did you lose your job?

221
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:14,461
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, they never told me, it's a temp assignment

222
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:20,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I think because I was being paid more than the other temps because I'm cooler than they are.

223
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:22,636
[SPEAKER_06]: So, like, we don't want to pay her.

224
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:24,597
[SPEAKER_06]: She costs too much money and she's too damn good.

225
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,521
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything else you want to say?

226
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,103
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I guess we can save the rest for the FUs of the week, which we'll do later.

227
00:18:32,523 --> 00:18:32,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.

228
00:18:33,084 --> 00:18:34,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say it right now.

229
00:18:34,164 --> 00:18:34,365
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

230
00:18:34,685 --> 00:18:38,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck them, fuck them, fuck them, fuck them, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

231
00:18:39,472 --> 00:18:39,773
[SPEAKER_18]: Anymore?

232
00:18:40,894 --> 00:18:42,476
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

233
00:18:42,657 --> 00:18:45,000
[SPEAKER_18]: Question for Loki, I guess.

234
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,143
[SPEAKER_18]: What is this about Dancing Stage Megamix?

235
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:47,864
[SPEAKER_18]: True?

236
00:18:50,187 --> 00:18:51,268
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's a question for you.

237
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:52,210
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck?

238
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,732
[SPEAKER_18]: Dancing Stage Megamix?

239
00:18:54,272 --> 00:18:54,993
[SPEAKER_18]: I've never heard of it.

240
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:55,975
[SPEAKER_18]: The hell are you talking about?

241
00:18:58,169 --> 00:18:58,629
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.

242
00:18:58,749 --> 00:19:01,331
[SPEAKER_18]: I've never heard of what you're talking about here.

243
00:19:01,511 --> 00:19:02,852
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a link, I think.

244
00:19:02,952 --> 00:19:03,332
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

245
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:04,993
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what the hell they're talking about.

246
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:05,533
[SPEAKER_18]: This is it.

247
00:19:05,553 --> 00:19:05,813
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we go.

248
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:16,685
[SPEAKER_18]: Konami is in fact hard at work with a new dancing stage game, and this time it's for the PS2.

249
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:20,608
[SPEAKER_18]: They have licensed new songs for it, and the date is set to a May release in Europe.

250
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:23,010
[SPEAKER_18]: There are ten licensed songs in the mix.

251
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,151
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of them are as follows.

252
00:19:24,671 --> 00:19:24,892
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

253
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:30,697
[SPEAKER_18]: Dynamite, It Takes More, Elvis, A Little Less Conversation, Kylie Minogue, Love at First Sight,

254
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:36,985
[SPEAKER_18]: The Sugar Babes, Freak Like Me, Christina Milian, When You Look At Me, The Cure, Love Cats.

255
00:19:37,846 --> 00:19:38,466
[SPEAKER_18]: That's crazy.

256
00:19:39,107 --> 00:19:42,892
[SPEAKER_18]: It'll also feature 20 original tracks created by the Konami development team.

257
00:19:42,952 --> 00:19:46,357
[SPEAKER_18]: It will also have the normal features like Arcade Mode, Practice Mode, and Workout Mode.

258
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:48,520
[SPEAKER_18]: It'll also feature a tutorial mode for beginners.

259
00:19:49,432 --> 00:19:57,614
[SPEAKER_17]: Once again, I've been saying this before, you know, it really sucks that Euromix stuff gets better music than our fucking US mixes.

260
00:19:58,034 --> 00:20:08,216
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, let's see, they started putting licensed tracks, you know, in our first one, but ever since the get-go for Dancing Stage, they've had licensed tracks that are exclusive to them, and I think that sucks ass.

261
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:13,357
[SPEAKER_16]: But, yeah, the one day I'm not on the internet, there's stuff happening.

262
00:20:13,737 --> 00:20:14,297
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate that.

263
00:20:14,457 --> 00:20:17,018
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like I'm on the internet all the fucking time.

264
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:20,040
[SPEAKER_16]: All day long on the fucking internet.

265
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,162
[SPEAKER_17]: Waiting for something to happen.

266
00:20:22,782 --> 00:20:23,803
[SPEAKER_17]: Nothing ever happens.

267
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,044
[SPEAKER_17]: Then I turn it off, boom, something happens.

268
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:27,025
[SPEAKER_17]: I hate that.

269
00:20:28,346 --> 00:20:28,986
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see, what else?

270
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:33,009
[SPEAKER_18]: We're just leeching news right now from DDRmaniaX.net.

271
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, DDR, big brother.

272
00:20:35,411 --> 00:20:37,593
[SPEAKER_18]: Giving a little credit where credit's due.

273
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,014
[SPEAKER_18]: You have a suggestion, Jamie?

274
00:20:40,177 --> 00:20:41,860
[SPEAKER_06]: I have their address.

275
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:43,923
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I should do.

276
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:44,404
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

277
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:45,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

278
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:47,409
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking of ways of getting revenge against that woman.

279
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:49,493
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Jamie's plotting revenge on her work.

280
00:20:51,687 --> 00:20:52,448
[SPEAKER_18]: The former work.

281
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:59,214
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, DDR Mania X is reporting, and this is kind of neat, DDR was on Big Brother.

282
00:20:59,915 --> 00:21:00,775
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, Dancing Stage.

283
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,777
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, Dancing Stage was on Big Brother.

284
00:21:03,238 --> 00:21:06,821
[SPEAKER_18]: Not Big Brother in the U.S., but Big Brother, because Big Brother in the U.S.

285
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:10,184
[SPEAKER_18]: only airs in the summer, but it was on Big Brother in Norway.

286
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:24,905
[SPEAKER_18]: They had their very own dancing stage machine and they have this little picture here when they're all playing on the machine and one chick in the back says, fuck the machine, I'm going to play on the Nordic track.

287
00:21:25,145 --> 00:21:25,785
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what she's doing.

288
00:21:25,805 --> 00:21:29,508
[SPEAKER_18]: And then there's this bald guy looking on going, her?

289
00:21:30,328 --> 00:21:31,029
[SPEAKER_18]: What are they doing?

290
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:42,457
[SPEAKER_18]: And then there's these two chicks kind of dancing and it's obvious that they're... You can always tell a beginner in DDR because they have their hands to their side and they do the total dance that they do in the beginner screen.

291
00:21:42,477 --> 00:21:44,598
[SPEAKER_18]: If you watch that guy in the beginner screen, they do the total dance.

292
00:21:44,618 --> 00:21:47,360
[SPEAKER_18]: They have their hands to the side and they step right, right.

293
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:51,043
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, they're just totally... What do you mean because they're PA-ing?

294
00:21:51,303 --> 00:21:52,284
[SPEAKER_16]: People look like they're P.A.ing.

295
00:21:52,304 --> 00:21:54,747
[SPEAKER_16]: They've got their hands on their side and they're like stomping to the beat.

296
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:56,530
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, but even like people who P.A.

297
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,752
[SPEAKER_18]: kind of like move their hands at least a little bit.

298
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:04,720
[SPEAKER_18]: They don't look like freaking army sergeants standing there going, They don't do the river dance, in other words.

299
00:22:06,604 --> 00:22:08,405
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, they're river dancing, that's what they're doing.

300
00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:12,607
[SPEAKER_18]: People who've played DDR for like at least three days don't river dance anymore.

301
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:14,948
[SPEAKER_17]: Who knows?

302
00:22:14,988 --> 00:22:16,229
[SPEAKER_17]: They have no emotion.

303
00:22:17,229 --> 00:22:19,330
[SPEAKER_18]: We're also hearing that DDR was on MTV.

304
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,012
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if anybody saw this, but I guess it was Friday or Saturday night.

305
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:25,994
[SPEAKER_18]: They had True Life, I'm a Gamer.

306
00:22:26,654 --> 00:22:28,175
[SPEAKER_18]: Something was on TV Friday or Saturday.

307
00:22:28,195 --> 00:22:31,897
[SPEAKER_18]: It was supposed to be this special all about hardcore gamers.

308
00:22:32,817 --> 00:22:37,600
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't watch it because I knew it would suck, and then coming onto message boards today, guess what?

309
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,180
[SPEAKER_18]: It sucked.

310
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:40,521
[SPEAKER_17]: Shock?

311
00:22:41,022 --> 00:22:42,622
[SPEAKER_17]: MTV programming sucks?

312
00:22:43,383 --> 00:22:43,963
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow.

313
00:22:44,043 --> 00:22:44,904
[SPEAKER_18]: Shock of shocks.

314
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:45,784
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god.

315
00:22:47,105 --> 00:22:47,945
[SPEAKER_17]: When did that happen?

316
00:22:48,126 --> 00:22:48,526
[SPEAKER_18]: Who knows?

317
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:53,689
[SPEAKER_18]: And knowing MTV, don't worry if you didn't see it, they'll rerun it 50 times.

318
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:56,130
[SPEAKER_18]: So just, you know, look in your TV guide.

319
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,292
[SPEAKER_06]: The downfall of MTV began with the banishment of Martha Quinn.

320
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:00,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, whatever.

321
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:02,054
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell is that?

322
00:23:02,074 --> 00:23:03,636
[SPEAKER_18]: The loss of Kennedy, I concur.

323
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,718
[SPEAKER_17]: They have one show that they show.

324
00:23:06,378 --> 00:23:08,421
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like these three sets of people.

325
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,543
[SPEAKER_17]: It's what they do on one Saturday night.

326
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:14,366
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like you're riding with teenagers as they do nothing.

327
00:23:16,008 --> 00:23:17,630
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because people run out of ideas.

328
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:23,576
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like, don't live your own life right now, however pathetic it might be, but watch someone else live their pathetic life.

329
00:23:25,376 --> 00:23:27,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't give a shit about how other people live their lives.

330
00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:31,621
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're not talking about, like, road rules where they go and do really cool shit like, you know, skydiving and all that stuff.

331
00:23:31,641 --> 00:23:33,663
[SPEAKER_17]: We're talking about average teenagers.

332
00:23:33,723 --> 00:23:35,224
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what sucks about road rules, though?

333
00:23:36,045 --> 00:23:36,605
[SPEAKER_18]: It's old.

334
00:23:36,785 --> 00:23:37,586
[SPEAKER_18]: It's fucking old.

335
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:39,748
[SPEAKER_18]: They do the same thing every year.

336
00:23:40,148 --> 00:23:42,009
[SPEAKER_18]: Same shit, new location.

337
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:47,734
[SPEAKER_18]: There's some fag, there's some bitch, there's some black guy, and they all fight all the time.

338
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:48,555
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what they do.

339
00:23:48,855 --> 00:23:49,876
[SPEAKER_18]: This show's getting old.

340
00:23:50,256 --> 00:23:52,257
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's the one person who goes, okay.

341
00:23:52,657 --> 00:23:59,301
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, and then there's the virgin, the chick that's like, oh, I'm a Mormon, and I'm never going to do anything bad.

342
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:02,882
[SPEAKER_18]: And then she gets fucked three ways from yesterday before the series is over.

343
00:24:02,902 --> 00:24:04,563
[SPEAKER_17]: I still want to be on the real world.

344
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:05,864
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to be on the real world.

345
00:24:05,984 --> 00:24:07,164
[SPEAKER_17]: You should be on the real world.

346
00:24:07,285 --> 00:24:10,626
[SPEAKER_17]: See, I wouldn't start fights with anyone, but I'd just be totally strange.

347
00:24:10,746 --> 00:24:11,807
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd just be the weird guy.

348
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:15,329
[SPEAKER_17]: The guy that sits in the corner like, dude, that guy's weird, man.

349
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,990
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know what it is, but it's weird.

350
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,492
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, they come to talk to me, and you just, like, start screaming.

351
00:24:20,852 --> 00:24:22,193
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, weird shit like that.

352
00:24:22,354 --> 00:24:26,356
[SPEAKER_18]: Anybody that listens to this show knows that you'd be the crazy racist and homophobe.

353
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:29,319
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not the crazy racist homophobe guy.

354
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:30,519
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuckin' A, man.

355
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,061
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, man, I'm gonna be living with you.

356
00:24:33,902 --> 00:24:34,482
[SPEAKER_16]: Shit, man.

357
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:36,644
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why they have auditions for these shows.

358
00:24:37,505 --> 00:24:42,628
[SPEAKER_06]: See, if I were on any of these programs, I would be sitting in the back of my Game Boy.

359
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:45,334
[SPEAKER_06]: We should do something, though.

360
00:24:45,374 --> 00:24:47,317
[SPEAKER_06]: We should do our own, like, reality show.

361
00:24:48,538 --> 00:24:49,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Reality Radio.

362
00:24:51,843 --> 00:24:54,747
[SPEAKER_18]: This kind of is reality radio, because it's not like we talk about Mamadi ever.

363
00:24:56,044 --> 00:25:03,806
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I mean, like, we should, you know, get a video camera and go on, like, a weekend road trip or something and videotape it and post it on the internet.

364
00:25:04,606 --> 00:25:05,966
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what we do.

365
00:25:05,986 --> 00:25:10,867
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the thing is I tried to do that for Cyber Beat and it came out really, really bad.

366
00:25:10,987 --> 00:25:11,927
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you have a video camera?

367
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:13,148
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't even think it ever aired.

368
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:15,128
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I didn't have a video camera.

369
00:25:15,628 --> 00:25:17,329
[SPEAKER_04]: We could get a video camera and go.

370
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:18,909
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll do that for Agent 3.

371
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:22,639
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

372
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:24,641
[SPEAKER_18]: Girls Gone Wild E3 Edition.

373
00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:31,486
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I don't know if we should say anything, but there's a chance that we might have a hookup with E3.

374
00:25:31,806 --> 00:25:32,767
[SPEAKER_18]: But we don't know yet.

375
00:25:32,867 --> 00:25:33,367
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't know yet.

376
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:35,329
[SPEAKER_18]: We definitely have the hookup with B3.

377
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:36,830
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't know about E3.

378
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:37,991
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe.

379
00:25:38,511 --> 00:25:42,934
[SPEAKER_18]: And if this happens, if this happens, I'm going to put out for these tickets.

380
00:25:44,235 --> 00:25:44,816
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously.

381
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:45,996
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm so excited.

382
00:25:46,096 --> 00:25:46,577
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll see.

383
00:25:47,998 --> 00:25:48,359
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

384
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:11,645
[SPEAKER_18]: If that happens, we will do an E3 reality show, but we're still kind of hanging off to see if it's going to happen or not.

385
00:26:11,705 --> 00:26:12,406
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I don't know.

386
00:26:12,486 --> 00:26:15,027
[SPEAKER_18]: It sounds hopeful, but I'm kind of like, I don't know.

387
00:26:15,528 --> 00:26:20,951
[SPEAKER_18]: But we might have an end, and it's very exciting, so I'm moist with anticipation, as should all of you, because E3 rules.

388
00:26:21,992 --> 00:26:24,253
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, why are you messing with my shoes?

389
00:26:24,273 --> 00:26:24,514
[SPEAKER_18]: You're like...

390
00:26:26,229 --> 00:26:26,489
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway.

391
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,071
[SPEAKER_18]: So yeah, DDR on Big Brother.

392
00:26:29,132 --> 00:26:30,873
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think you should try out for Big Brother.

393
00:26:30,973 --> 00:26:33,395
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to try out for Big Brother, because I think I'd be awesome on the show.

394
00:26:33,955 --> 00:26:35,357
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd fucking win Big Brother.

395
00:26:37,018 --> 00:26:41,682
[SPEAKER_18]: Big Brother is the one where they have no computers, no news, no TVs or nothing.

396
00:26:42,022 --> 00:26:47,286
[SPEAKER_18]: They're just in a house with cameras watching them 24 hours a day, and they just all have to coexist.

397
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:50,269
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't let you bring books.

398
00:26:56,104 --> 00:26:57,988
[SPEAKER_06]: So... I'll bring a book somehow.

399
00:26:58,028 --> 00:26:59,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll write a book.

400
00:27:00,171 --> 00:27:01,454
[SPEAKER_18]: Sneak a book in your bra.

401
00:27:02,195 --> 00:27:02,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll write a book.

402
00:27:03,117 --> 00:27:04,940
[SPEAKER_17]: I draw the arrows on the ground.

403
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,402
What are you doing, man?

404
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:10,576
[SPEAKER_18]: And what's funny about Big Brother, at least in the U.S.

405
00:27:10,656 --> 00:27:14,256
[SPEAKER_18]: anyway, Big Brother in the U.S., the first season, was shit.

406
00:27:14,336 --> 00:27:17,737
[SPEAKER_18]: It was absolute shit because it was totally not cast well at all.

407
00:27:17,757 --> 00:27:18,797
[SPEAKER_17]: Did they make them do anything?

408
00:27:19,277 --> 00:27:21,658
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, they have to do stupid little challenges every week.

409
00:27:21,678 --> 00:27:25,879
[SPEAKER_18]: But in the first season, some of their challenges was having to make paper mache.

410
00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:28,099
[SPEAKER_18]: It was shit.

411
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,280
[SPEAKER_18]: But then the second season, it started to get a little better.

412
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,681
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't watch the second season because the first season was so bad, I wouldn't watch the second season.

413
00:27:33,921 --> 00:27:35,221
[SPEAKER_18]: But I heard that's what started getting better.

414
00:27:35,461 --> 00:27:37,361
[SPEAKER_18]: And then this last season was really good.

415
00:27:37,642 --> 00:27:38,382
[SPEAKER_18]: Last season was good.

416
00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:41,642
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, they finally got some... You're a bitch!

417
00:27:41,963 --> 00:27:44,263
[SPEAKER_18]: You made Pippi Longstocking out of my shoes!

418
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,184
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, yeah, the last season of Big Brother was pretty good.

419
00:27:48,304 --> 00:28:01,307
[SPEAKER_18]: And I could totally see them doing something like this, where they bring in... Then that's what they do, is they just kind of drop a toy on them, like, and then in the next week, they would probably have to do, like, whoever's the best at DDR gets to win, gets to go out for dinner.

420
00:28:01,707 --> 00:28:02,728
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh man, I would love that.

421
00:28:02,988 --> 00:28:06,250
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like they do the same thing for that show and you're on the show.

422
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,091
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, and see, I would... They're playing it and they're like, okay, who's the best of all?

423
00:28:09,472 --> 00:28:10,932
[SPEAKER_17]: Start busting up.

424
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:13,414
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god, just don't even try.

425
00:28:13,434 --> 00:28:14,454
[SPEAKER_18]: See, you know, I'd fake it.

426
00:28:14,535 --> 00:28:17,436
[SPEAKER_18]: Like for that whole week, I'd fake it that I really suck at DDR.

427
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:24,360
[SPEAKER_18]: And then like the last day of it, I'd just go fucking nuts and win the dinner and everybody would hate me and I'd get voted out.

428
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,402
[SPEAKER_06]: It just suddenly dawned on me as you're there, you know, PA-ing back.

429
00:28:27,442 --> 00:28:29,243
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, just like, it just clicked.

430
00:28:29,383 --> 00:28:30,003
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

431
00:28:31,244 --> 00:28:33,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god, it's not like I don't play this.

432
00:28:33,447 --> 00:28:33,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh.

433
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:35,870
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay, Jamie's going to fix my shoes.

434
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:42,992
[SPEAKER_18]: I have some more really important Bomani news, or Bomani-related news.

435
00:28:43,052 --> 00:28:46,174
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not really directly Bomani news, but it's about a Bomani artist.

436
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:48,996
[SPEAKER_18]: I have some really important Bomani news that we need to take care of.

437
00:28:49,637 --> 00:28:53,440
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's about a lady who was in Max 2.

438
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,801
[SPEAKER_18]: And you probably know this song.

439
00:28:56,242 --> 00:28:58,944
[SPEAKER_18]: She's Ginger Spice, and she did a song called It's Rainin' Men.

440
00:28:59,844 --> 00:29:00,665
[SPEAKER_18]: You all know that song.

441
00:29:01,426 --> 00:29:03,127
[SPEAKER_18]: She's not a Spice girl, but she used to be.

442
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,322
[SPEAKER_18]: But there was big revelations about Jerry Halliwell this week.

443
00:29:08,303 --> 00:29:09,704
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is the way the story goes.

444
00:29:10,204 --> 00:29:13,966
[SPEAKER_18]: Ex-Spice Girl Jerry admits she had a lesbian fling.

445
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:16,128
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh-oh.

446
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:23,472
[SPEAKER_18]: So former Spice Girl Jerry Halliwell says she has had a brief encounter with another woman but denies she's a lesbian.

447
00:29:24,533 --> 00:29:26,274
[SPEAKER_18]: So she's not joining Tattoo or anything.

448
00:29:26,294 --> 00:29:27,755
[SPEAKER_18]: Remember, try it but don't like it.

449
00:29:29,028 --> 00:29:36,094
[SPEAKER_18]: The singer, who has dated fellow pop star Robbie Williams, told Thursday's Sun tabloid that after the fling, she quickly realized that she was not gay.

450
00:29:36,614 --> 00:29:41,698
[SPEAKER_18]: I had a little lesbian thing, she said, adding the encounter with an unnamed woman had been part of experimenting.

451
00:29:42,499 --> 00:29:46,702
[SPEAKER_18]: She refused to pinpoint the date, but said it was somewhere between the ages of 16 and 30.

452
00:29:48,884 --> 00:29:51,085
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's somewhere between now and never.

453
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:54,588
[SPEAKER_18]: It was just a drunken moment.

454
00:29:56,387 --> 00:29:58,989
[SPEAKER_16]: You wanna go home and have sex with me?

455
00:29:59,629 --> 00:30:00,549
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure!

456
00:30:00,689 --> 00:30:01,930
[SPEAKER_18]: Wanna touch my cooter?

457
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,772
[SPEAKER_18]: And a man.

458
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:28,158
[SPEAKER_18]: Hallowell, or Ginger Spice, as she was known during her time with the band, left the Spice Girls in 98 amid reports of bitter squabbling.

459
00:30:30,201 --> 00:30:32,383
[SPEAKER_18]: The 30-year-old singer is currently hosting the U.S.

460
00:30:32,423 --> 00:30:34,606
[SPEAKER_18]: television beauty and talent show All-American Girl.

461
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:39,251
[SPEAKER_18]: Which, by the way, funny enough, All-American Girl was the name of Margaret Cho's show.

462
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,561
[SPEAKER_18]: Much, much different program.

463
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:42,903
[SPEAKER_18]: Also on ABC.

464
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,425
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you believe they blatantly just took that name?

465
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:50,069
[SPEAKER_18]: Especially after Margaret Cho's movie about the hell she went through on that show.

466
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:50,989
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you know what's funny?

467
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:56,714
[SPEAKER_17]: They're having Howard Stern is actually, you know that show, Are You Hot?

468
00:30:57,015 --> 00:30:57,215
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

469
00:30:57,695 --> 00:31:01,258
[SPEAKER_17]: He's suing the producers of that show because it was his idea.

470
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:01,879
[SPEAKER_17]: Because...

471
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:13,467
[SPEAKER_18]: If you go to smokinggun.com, which is like my favorite website on the entire internet, you can read the court documents of Howard Stern filing the lawsuit with ABC.

472
00:31:13,507 --> 00:31:19,152
[SPEAKER_18]: Because apparently, he used to do this bit on his show, and it's been a long time since I've listened to Howard Stern in it.

473
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:20,533
[SPEAKER_18]: I never even saw it.

474
00:31:20,573 --> 00:31:21,353
[SPEAKER_18]: I used to watch the E!

475
00:31:21,393 --> 00:31:23,875
[SPEAKER_18]: show and I used to listen to it in the morning, but I never saw this segment.

476
00:31:24,336 --> 00:31:25,476
[SPEAKER_18]: But I guess it's been on for a while.

477
00:31:25,536 --> 00:31:28,098
[SPEAKER_18]: It was the Examiners, what was it called?

478
00:31:28,158 --> 00:31:28,338
[SPEAKER_18]: The...

479
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:32,724
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, but they would have... I think it was called the same thing, actually.

480
00:31:32,764 --> 00:31:33,806
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it wasn't called Are You Hot?

481
00:31:33,826 --> 00:31:34,506
[SPEAKER_18]: It had something else.

482
00:31:35,247 --> 00:31:38,472
[SPEAKER_17]: Still, I even thought that they were ripping that off of that website, Are You Hot or Not?

483
00:31:38,552 --> 00:31:38,672
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

484
00:31:38,692 --> 00:31:39,213
[SPEAKER_17]: They sued him, too.

485
00:31:42,082 --> 00:31:42,622
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

486
00:32:03,813 --> 00:32:04,134
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

487
00:32:04,374 --> 00:32:07,076
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, they have Lorenzo Llamas as a judge.

488
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:07,636
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, him.

489
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:08,077
[SPEAKER_18]: Never mind.

490
00:32:08,157 --> 00:32:10,239
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm getting Eric Estrada mixed up with Lorenzo Llamas.

491
00:32:10,699 --> 00:32:11,700
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know how or why, but I did.

492
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,501
[SPEAKER_17]: He's like, yeah, I don't like women with fake breasts.

493
00:32:15,783 --> 00:32:16,324
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait, hold on.

494
00:32:16,344 --> 00:32:18,646
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's flash back for a second here.

495
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:24,270
[SPEAKER_17]: Didn't you just... Weren't you dating or, say, married to a Playboy model?

496
00:32:25,572 --> 00:32:27,433
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, just to fill you in.

497
00:32:27,453 --> 00:32:27,853
[SPEAKER_17]: Guess what?

498
00:32:28,254 --> 00:32:29,235
[SPEAKER_12]: They weren't real.

499
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Fake breasts.

500
00:32:32,721 --> 00:32:35,362
[SPEAKER_17]: Breasts aren't supposed to be like solid plastic.

501
00:32:35,942 --> 00:32:42,605
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, when she hits the wall, they're supposed to kind of like give a little bit, not like crush through them.

502
00:32:42,685 --> 00:32:44,265
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a surgical flotation device.

503
00:32:45,806 --> 00:32:46,626
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a bath toy.

504
00:32:47,587 --> 00:32:53,589
[SPEAKER_17]: In case of water landing, the bosom may be used as a flotation device.

505
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:58,311
[SPEAKER_18]: So this begs the topic that we need to do a new segment here on Orange Lounge Radio.

506
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,794
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't wanna see that shit unless you really are hot.

507
00:33:22,097 --> 00:33:27,420
[SPEAKER_18]: Only if you're really, really hot, and like people tell you that on a daily basis, then nude photos are okay.

508
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:30,763
[SPEAKER_18]: But if you don't get told that every day, don't send it.

509
00:33:31,263 --> 00:33:37,127
[SPEAKER_18]: So you're just going to send it to OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com, and we'll let you know how you rank, okay?

510
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:40,349
[SPEAKER_18]: And Howard Stern can sue us if he wants, but you know, you can't get blood out of a turnip.

511
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:45,752
[SPEAKER_18]: So, send your photos, graphs of you playing DDR, and we'll let you know if you're hot or not.

512
00:33:46,032 --> 00:33:47,433
[SPEAKER_18]: And what we'll do... Huh?

513
00:33:48,414 --> 00:33:48,554
[SPEAKER_18]: See...

514
00:33:52,546 --> 00:33:56,509
[SPEAKER_18]: And remember that all pictures submitted become the property of Orange Lounge Radio.

515
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:58,971
[SPEAKER_18]: We say that because we're going to put your pictures on our website.

516
00:33:59,272 --> 00:34:03,515
[SPEAKER_18]: Because this is radio, obviously, other people are going to need to see these somehow.

517
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:06,858
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to put your pictures up on the site so that people can access them.

518
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:08,699
[SPEAKER_18]: Brilliant, huh?

519
00:34:10,361 --> 00:34:10,821
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

520
00:34:12,002 --> 00:34:13,823
[SPEAKER_18]: And Jamie says if you... No.

521
00:34:17,209 --> 00:34:21,774
[SPEAKER_18]: It reminds us of an old segment from Under Sedation Live, the kind of show that came before this.

522
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:23,896
[SPEAKER_18]: Has anybody ever listened to Under Sedation Live?

523
00:34:24,316 --> 00:34:25,718
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to listen or we'll shoot you.

524
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:28,921
[SPEAKER_18]: There was an old segment that also included pictures submitting.

525
00:34:29,762 --> 00:34:30,883
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, excellent question.

526
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:34,466
[SPEAKER_18]: EOSFEB asks, what if he whips his cock out at the end of the routine?

527
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:35,587
[SPEAKER_18]: Good question.

528
00:34:35,767 --> 00:34:36,548
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to know what?

529
00:34:37,069 --> 00:34:37,229
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

530
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:47,920
[SPEAKER_06]: No offense to any of our guys listening, but I think that as far as organs go, that the penis is the weirdest looking thing ever.

531
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:48,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you think that?

532
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:49,901
[SPEAKER_06]: They just are ugly.

533
00:34:51,162 --> 00:34:52,883
[SPEAKER_18]: Just because they're just like there?

534
00:34:52,903 --> 00:34:55,184
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want someone to whip out their cock on film.

535
00:34:55,204 --> 00:34:55,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

536
00:34:57,567 --> 00:35:04,538
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, what if somebody whipped out their cock and in an amazing yaoi fetish film another guy started sucking it?

537
00:35:04,558 --> 00:35:05,138
[SPEAKER_18]: Would that be okay?

538
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:05,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

539
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:06,861
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, much better.

540
00:35:07,622 --> 00:35:09,745
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you hypocrite!

541
00:35:12,589 --> 00:35:12,910
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

542
00:35:16,707 --> 00:35:22,368
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want... Okay, so send those pictures to OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com.

543
00:35:22,388 --> 00:35:23,528
[SPEAKER_18]: They have to be of you playing DDR.

544
00:35:23,828 --> 00:35:26,629
[SPEAKER_18]: And no nudes unless you're told that you're hot every single day.

545
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:28,249
[SPEAKER_18]: And you have to have proof.

546
00:35:28,289 --> 00:35:29,670
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody has to send us an affidavit.

547
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not retarded.

548
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:37,291
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that it's the strangest looking... I didn't say I didn't like cock.

549
00:35:38,691 --> 00:35:40,092
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just funny looking.

550
00:35:41,352 --> 00:35:42,132
[SPEAKER_17]: I can just see it now.

551
00:35:43,052 --> 00:35:44,994
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, that's really weird looking.

552
00:35:45,194 --> 00:35:45,994
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah, thanks.

553
00:35:46,415 --> 00:35:47,756
[SPEAKER_17]: Whoa, that does it for me.

554
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:50,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh come on, even Dan agrees with me.

555
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,281
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like Carrot Top.

556
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:57,283
[SPEAKER_18]: He's funny looking, but everybody loves Carrot Top.

557
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:58,584
[SPEAKER_18]: No wait, nobody loves Carrot Top.

558
00:35:59,004 --> 00:36:00,105
[SPEAKER_18]: How about Yahoo Serious?

559
00:36:01,446 --> 00:36:02,787
[SPEAKER_18]: Yahoo Serious, funny looking.

560
00:36:03,307 --> 00:36:04,628
[SPEAKER_18]: But everybody loves Yahoo Serious.

561
00:36:04,648 --> 00:36:06,050
[SPEAKER_17]: We like him because he's Australian.

562
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:06,670
[SPEAKER_17]: That's true.

563
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:06,950
[SPEAKER_17]: He's funny.

564
00:36:07,671 --> 00:36:09,152
[SPEAKER_17]: He plays with the Tasmanian Devils.

565
00:36:09,993 --> 00:36:10,113
[SPEAKER_17]: Ah.

566
00:36:10,193 --> 00:36:11,374
[SPEAKER_17]: Funny Australian stuff.

567
00:36:13,387 --> 00:36:15,168
[SPEAKER_18]: What if you tell yourself you're hot every day?

568
00:36:38,651 --> 00:36:40,291
[SPEAKER_18]: So, moving along.

569
00:36:41,392 --> 00:36:42,292
[SPEAKER_18]: What else do we have to talk about?

570
00:36:44,053 --> 00:36:46,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't know.

571
00:36:46,894 --> 00:36:48,054
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just not happy today.

572
00:36:48,334 --> 00:36:49,115
[SPEAKER_18]: You're just not happy today?

573
00:36:49,435 --> 00:36:49,595
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

574
00:36:49,635 --> 00:36:50,075
[SPEAKER_18]: What's up, Loki?

575
00:36:51,287 --> 00:36:52,808
[SPEAKER_17]: Ah, there's microphones coming in from which way?

576
00:36:53,508 --> 00:37:01,171
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, actually, in two weeks, we're probably going to see the last, I think, of the DDR Extreme Unlocks.

577
00:37:02,272 --> 00:37:02,572
[SPEAKER_17]: I think.

578
00:37:02,812 --> 00:37:03,693
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't remember offhand.

579
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:10,395
[SPEAKER_17]: I think there's 30, well, number-wise, as far as the Unlocks go, there's a total of 30 different Unlocks.

580
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:35,755
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean even though like number 30 is like three different songs or three different whatever but there's only like 30 total and we're up to 24 right now so in two weeks we're gonna have the rest of the songs supposedly so which ought to make it very interesting because in two weeks from now is March Madness yes March Madness so I wonder if we're gonna see any like last minute routines to some of these new songs

581
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,739
[SPEAKER_18]: March Madness will be broadcasting live, by the way, on Orange Lounge Radio.

582
00:37:40,779 --> 00:37:53,304
[SPEAKER_18]: For those of you not in NorCal or SoCal, driving up here or whatever, if you're too far away to come to the tournament in person, you can attend online and just visit our website, and we'll be doing a live broadcast all day long, both days.

583
00:37:53,664 --> 00:38:00,266
[SPEAKER_18]: So that does mean in two weeks, the normal live program here on Orange Lounge will be preempted by that coverage, so we won't be on live.

584
00:38:00,606 --> 00:38:06,108
[SPEAKER_18]: and chances are we're actually going to finish up over there probably around 7 o'clock so there won't be a show in two weeks.

585
00:38:06,248 --> 00:38:07,549
[SPEAKER_18]: But we'll be here next week, of course.

586
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,030
Yeah.

587
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:13,971
[SPEAKER_06]: If anyone expects me to do a fuck-off afterwards, you can fuck off.

588
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:15,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm going to be dead.

589
00:38:17,913 --> 00:38:21,914
[SPEAKER_18]: Had a tournament here last night, says NinjaOsakeKoi.

590
00:38:22,795 --> 00:38:23,455
[SPEAKER_18]: It was interesting.

591
00:38:25,211 --> 00:38:25,852
[SPEAKER_18]: Where was that tournament?

592
00:38:25,872 --> 00:38:28,135
[SPEAKER_18]: Was that the tournament in Albany, by chance?

593
00:38:28,155 --> 00:38:32,281
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I know there was a big one that was supposed to go on the East Coast yesterday, and I haven't heard anything about that.

594
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:33,642
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm wondering how it went.

595
00:38:33,662 --> 00:38:38,669
[SPEAKER_18]: If somebody wants to tell me about how that went, certainly, I'll fill you all in on that.

596
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:41,593
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, this particular tournament was in Hickory, North Carolina.

597
00:38:42,714 --> 00:38:43,094
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool.

598
00:38:44,475 --> 00:39:06,752
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, if any of you folks out there on the East Coast, other places, Mid Coast, basically anywhere outside of California, you want to do some tournament coverage, you want to maybe take a tape recorder over and talk to some people there, talk to the winners, talk about the tournament, put together a little bit like 10 minutes long little package about the tournament, we'll air it here on Orange Lounge Radio.

599
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:11,796
[SPEAKER_18]: We put a call out a while back on LiveJournal, but nobody sent us anything, so fuck them.

600
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:17,686
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.

601
00:39:19,486 --> 00:39:20,046
[SPEAKER_18]: Suggestion.

602
00:39:20,086 --> 00:39:26,768
[SPEAKER_18]: We should do a March Madness tournament of DDR songs or something sort of like NCAA basketball brackets with voting to win.

603
00:39:27,989 --> 00:39:30,889
[SPEAKER_18]: That kind of reminds me of what GameFacts.com did a while back.

604
00:39:31,189 --> 00:39:32,810
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, that was suggested by Brack2000, by the way.

605
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:40,332
[SPEAKER_18]: That kind of reminds me, were any of you watching GameFacts.com a while back when they did that top video game character of all time?

606
00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:46,431
[SPEAKER_06]: GameFacts.com was back in April when they had Xbox.com.

607
00:39:47,192 --> 00:39:48,153
[SPEAKER_06]: XboxFacts.com.

608
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:49,795
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, the April Fool's joke?

609
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:52,718
[SPEAKER_18]: I think right after that.

610
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:58,224
[SPEAKER_18]: It was during the summer they did the top 64 characters of all time.

611
00:40:01,073 --> 00:40:01,913
[SPEAKER_17]: Know what I don't like?

612
00:40:02,614 --> 00:40:04,494
[SPEAKER_17]: Is this new show on TechTV.

613
00:40:04,674 --> 00:40:07,756
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like this Microsoft-only show.

614
00:40:07,776 --> 00:40:09,856
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like all Microsoft propaganda.

615
00:40:11,157 --> 00:40:12,097
[SPEAKER_17]: Stupid Nazis.

616
00:40:12,998 --> 00:40:13,478
[SPEAKER_18]: What is it about?

617
00:40:13,498 --> 00:40:14,158
[SPEAKER_18]: I've never seen this.

618
00:40:14,438 --> 00:40:19,700
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like extra tips for Microsoft products and Microsoft this and Microsoft that.

619
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:27,683
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's all about Microsoft and how wonderful Microsoft is and how Microsoft, you know, heals the world and whatnot.

620
00:40:27,943 --> 00:40:29,344
[SPEAKER_17]: And it sucks ass.

621
00:40:30,339 --> 00:40:34,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that parody they put out by the Micro Shaft Corporation, Wimblows?

622
00:40:35,881 --> 00:40:36,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

623
00:40:39,262 --> 00:40:39,802
[SPEAKER_17]: They suck.

624
00:40:41,502 --> 00:40:47,064
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I think what we're going to do, we're going to go to a quick break, then we're going to come back and get to the FUs of the week.

625
00:40:47,844 --> 00:40:50,825
[SPEAKER_18]: And it'll definitely be short this week because there's only three of us here in studio.

626
00:40:51,145 --> 00:40:52,885
[SPEAKER_18]: There's lots of you.

627
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:58,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, but there's lots of you, so you can go ahead and send those FUs over to Sky via private message in the channel.

628
00:41:00,184 --> 00:41:01,365
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.

629
00:41:01,645 --> 00:41:02,866
[SPEAKER_18]: We have another hot or not question.

630
00:41:03,306 --> 00:41:06,088
[SPEAKER_18]: I only have a video of me playing Legend of Max.

631
00:41:06,128 --> 00:41:07,088
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that acceptable?

632
00:41:07,188 --> 00:41:07,468
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

633
00:41:07,748 --> 00:41:09,730
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, but please don't email that.

634
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:14,612
[SPEAKER_18]: If you could put that on the web somewhere and give us a link and email us the link, that would be great.

635
00:41:14,692 --> 00:41:15,153
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't send us...

636
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:19,691
[SPEAKER_17]: or there's programs out there that take screencaps of videos.

637
00:41:19,751 --> 00:41:22,514
[SPEAKER_17]: They'll cut a frame right out of it and you can use that too.

638
00:41:23,535 --> 00:41:34,066
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so please don't email us video, but email us like a link to the video or take a screencap of it because we don't want any files over like 200k or something or else our email box will fill up too damn quick.

639
00:41:35,543 --> 00:41:35,803
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

640
00:41:36,704 --> 00:41:37,784
[SPEAKER_18]: What do we want to hear this break?

641
00:41:37,864 --> 00:41:38,445
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you guys think?

642
00:41:38,765 --> 00:41:39,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Entrance.

643
00:41:39,686 --> 00:41:39,886
[SPEAKER_18]: Entrance.

644
00:41:39,906 --> 00:41:41,447
[SPEAKER_18]: Didn't we already... No, we didn't do Entrance.

645
00:41:41,487 --> 00:41:43,888
[SPEAKER_18]: Entrance is the one you said I should have played that we didn't do.

646
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:44,949
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

647
00:41:48,451 --> 00:41:49,411
[SPEAKER_18]: Heaven is a Metallic 57 Grey?

648
00:41:49,431 --> 00:41:50,852
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't even know if I can find that one.

649
00:41:50,872 --> 00:41:51,593
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll see if I can find it.

650
00:41:52,433 --> 00:41:52,753
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

651
00:41:54,034 --> 00:41:55,095
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, Entrance, Entrance, Entrance.

652
00:41:55,135 --> 00:41:56,336
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't have Entrance.

653
00:41:56,376 --> 00:41:57,596
[SPEAKER_18]: What style was Entrance on?

654
00:41:57,616 --> 00:41:59,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Entrance first came out in 5th style.

655
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:02,319
[SPEAKER_18]: Entrance first came out in 5th style.

656
00:42:08,327 --> 00:42:09,530
[SPEAKER_18]: I think someone else might have just showed up.

657
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,453
[SPEAKER_18]: We had the door go.

658
00:42:10,633 --> 00:42:12,398
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see who opens up the door in a little bit.

659
00:42:15,008 --> 00:42:16,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Kitsushite, thanks.

660
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:54,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

661
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:02,207
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 37.

662
00:48:02,527 --> 00:48:06,989
[SPEAKER_18]: With the amazing... With the guest starring the amazing buzzing noise.

663
00:48:07,069 --> 00:48:09,711
[SPEAKER_18]: We apologize about that, but there's not shit we can do about it right now.

664
00:48:09,751 --> 00:48:10,271
[SPEAKER_18]: We apologize.

665
00:48:10,851 --> 00:48:12,872
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're all going to talk good and loud tonight, yes?

666
00:48:13,493 --> 00:48:14,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we will.

667
00:48:14,633 --> 00:48:15,254
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, so...

668
00:48:16,491 --> 00:48:18,193
[SPEAKER_18]: During the break, the room blew up.

669
00:48:18,433 --> 00:48:20,295
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, we doubled in size during the break.

670
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:23,078
[SPEAKER_18]: So let's say hello to all our tardy folks tonight.

671
00:48:23,118 --> 00:48:23,579
[SPEAKER_18]: That's okay.

672
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:25,281
[SPEAKER_18]: Intern Zero made it.

673
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:26,923
[SPEAKER_15]: What, he didn't call in for me?

674
00:48:27,563 --> 00:48:27,803
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

675
00:48:28,464 --> 00:48:30,086
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have a phone to call into.

676
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:35,312
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I actually, according to my call log, I missed like four calls from Matt.

677
00:48:36,832 --> 00:48:37,873
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't seen a Bjork video.

678
00:48:37,893 --> 00:48:38,254
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, great.

679
00:48:38,294 --> 00:48:38,414
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks.

680
00:48:59,116 --> 00:49:00,197
[SPEAKER_18]: Human Behavior, the one with the bear.

681
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,839
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw the one where she's jumping around and just being stupid, though.

682
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,444
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like she's just bouncing off her couch or something like that.

683
00:49:07,464 --> 00:49:09,746
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't remember a Bjork video with a couch in it.

684
00:49:09,806 --> 00:49:10,066
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

685
00:49:10,086 --> 00:49:10,426
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

686
00:49:10,767 --> 00:49:11,287
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I know.

687
00:49:12,637 --> 00:49:16,660
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so, also here we have DDRholic, say hello.

688
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, good evening everybody, and always fashionably late, here I am.

689
00:49:20,623 --> 00:49:25,466
[SPEAKER_18]: It's alright, we forgive you, because we know there was a lot of partying last night, there was a little bit of partying.

690
00:49:25,506 --> 00:49:27,367
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was so cool, it was great.

691
00:49:27,527 --> 00:49:28,788
[SPEAKER_18]: How late did the party go, tell?

692
00:49:28,848 --> 00:49:29,909
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we left about 3.30.

693
00:49:30,229 --> 00:49:34,152
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably went until about 4, 4 o'clock.

694
00:49:36,513 --> 00:49:37,074
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, cool.

695
00:49:37,794 --> 00:49:38,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

696
00:49:38,755 --> 00:49:40,316
[SPEAKER_17]: I would have stayed back at work this morning.

697
00:49:40,336 --> 00:49:41,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I got cold feet.

698
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:45,157
[SPEAKER_17]: I got cold because his house has no heating at the time.

699
00:49:46,919 --> 00:49:48,401
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a little story to this.

700
00:49:49,002 --> 00:49:56,692
[SPEAKER_15]: The heater was on last night at like 100 degrees and so I went and turned it down and then I wake up this morning and somebody turned it all the way off.

701
00:49:58,212 --> 00:50:04,757
[SPEAKER_15]: It was comfortable and I turned it down to like 80 and then I wake up and it's just totally off because some stupid moron turned it off.

702
00:50:05,257 --> 00:50:06,578
[SPEAKER_15]: Probably one of the jerks in the back.

703
00:50:07,038 --> 00:50:10,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because it doesn't help that the heater is in the back of the house and there's none in the front.

704
00:50:11,382 --> 00:50:17,666
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know when you're at a party, you know when you're at a real party when like all these people are showing up that you don't fucking know.

705
00:50:18,206 --> 00:50:19,547
[SPEAKER_18]: That was happening last night.

706
00:50:20,028 --> 00:50:24,831
[SPEAKER_18]: All these people were showing up and what's even weirder, they know you but you don't know them.

707
00:50:25,171 --> 00:50:25,772
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, that's weird.

708
00:50:27,225 --> 00:50:28,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a nap, sorry.

709
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:30,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no problem.

710
00:50:30,447 --> 00:50:32,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I think most everybody took a nap at some point.

711
00:50:32,849 --> 00:50:33,890
[SPEAKER_18]: I took like a three hour nap.

712
00:50:35,591 --> 00:50:41,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I like took over that love seat and didn't move for a while except like to wake up every so often.

713
00:50:41,976 --> 00:50:45,118
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I woke up I'd be fully awake and then I'd be silly tired again.

714
00:50:46,638 --> 00:50:59,368
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, like, okay, it was kind of retarded at the end because all the kids in the back were screaming and being dumb and coming over and taking the couch so none of the adults had places to sit.

715
00:50:59,428 --> 00:51:02,870
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, Shane slept on the damn couch after you left so nobody could sit there.

716
00:51:03,511 --> 00:51:07,134
[SPEAKER_15]: And then Loki had his spot and I had my couch and that was it.

717
00:51:07,454 --> 00:51:09,976
[SPEAKER_15]: And they were still yelling at 5 o'clock in the morning.

718
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Those damn kids!

719
00:51:15,169 --> 00:51:19,136
[SPEAKER_17]: And then that was funny, that call the proceeds of the party from that stupid bitch.

720
00:51:22,034 --> 00:51:25,877
[SPEAKER_15]: This is like the best thing, which is actually pretty funny that Loki bitched it.

721
00:51:26,497 --> 00:51:33,042
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, Matt and Loki are at my house, we're setting up Loki's pads for a sim, and this girl calls.

722
00:51:33,342 --> 00:51:36,364
[SPEAKER_15]: I won't say her name, but she knows who she is because I know she's listening right now.

723
00:51:38,305 --> 00:51:43,048
[SPEAKER_15]: She calls, and she's just trying to lay these guilt trips on me, and I'm like, I want to get off the phone right now.

724
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,930
[SPEAKER_15]: And she's all, no, I don't want to let you.

725
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:50,133
[SPEAKER_15]: Then she tells me about how some truck drove by her and threw porn at her or something.

726
00:51:50,153 --> 00:51:50,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

727
00:51:51,555 --> 00:51:52,698
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a bad thing?

728
00:51:53,923 --> 00:51:55,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I want someone to throw porn at me.

729
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:05,041
[SPEAKER_15]: And then so I'm like, okay, and then she's like starting to get mad at me, so I just flat call her a bitch on the phone like four times, and they're over there laughing.

730
00:52:05,061 --> 00:52:06,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Language, now now.

731
00:52:06,462 --> 00:52:08,703
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

732
00:52:08,723 --> 00:52:09,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Bitch!

733
00:52:09,383 --> 00:52:09,723
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

734
00:52:10,143 --> 00:52:17,605
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, so they're over there laughing, and I'm trying not to laugh, and then she's, and I'm like, I just want to go, so you get annoyed with me.

735
00:52:17,645 --> 00:52:20,366
[SPEAKER_15]: I said, I want to go because I'm about to have a party, and I need to get ready for it.

736
00:52:20,386 --> 00:52:21,987
[SPEAKER_15]: She's like, you can hang up anytime.

737
00:52:22,647 --> 00:52:23,627
[SPEAKER_15]: And I said, oh, I can?

738
00:52:23,687 --> 00:52:24,468
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just hung the phone up.

739
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:29,500
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds worthy of me.

740
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,502
[SPEAKER_18]: That's interesting because it's like really mean yet kind of humorous at the same time.

741
00:52:33,963 --> 00:52:34,263
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

742
00:52:34,703 --> 00:52:39,406
[SPEAKER_18]: Also here, hiding in the corner, snacking on food, eating a lot and getting really fat.

743
00:52:40,207 --> 00:52:42,028
[SPEAKER_14]: Eating a lot, getting really fat, of course.

744
00:52:42,248 --> 00:52:45,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I have some catching up to do with that.

745
00:52:46,111 --> 00:52:48,472
[SPEAKER_18]: Say hello to the ice queen, cold as always.

746
00:52:48,652 --> 00:52:49,233
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right.

747
00:52:49,853 --> 00:52:51,334
[SPEAKER_18]: Or I should say frigid as always.

748
00:52:51,614 --> 00:52:52,154
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that too.

749
00:52:53,415 --> 00:52:59,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, you know, it's odd though because I don't really seem to remember much about last night except getting home at like 5 o'clock in the morning.

750
00:53:00,497 --> 00:53:01,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Go figure that.

751
00:53:04,178 --> 00:53:05,799
[SPEAKER_18]: He picked up a prostitute on the way home.

752
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I was very interested in driving while I was asleep.

753
00:53:16,883 --> 00:53:25,948
[SPEAKER_18]: So, we're going to catch you guys up on what you missed so far.

754
00:53:25,988 --> 00:53:29,509
[SPEAKER_18]: There's not a whole lot of Imani news this week, so we don't have a lot to talk about, surprise, surprise.

755
00:53:29,529 --> 00:53:39,094
[SPEAKER_18]: However, it did come out in the news that Jerry Halliwell, who did It's Rainin' Men from 7th Max 2, admitted she had a lesbian fling.

756
00:53:41,515 --> 00:53:46,319
[SPEAKER_17]: and the ever important Dancing Sage Megamix coming out for the PS2.

757
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:47,040
[SPEAKER_17]: Get this.

758
00:53:48,341 --> 00:53:48,801
[SPEAKER_18]: The Cure.

759
00:53:49,782 --> 00:53:54,226
[SPEAKER_17]: The Cure is going to be it and they're going to have a little less conversation in that remix of the Elvis song.

760
00:53:58,049 --> 00:54:00,371
[SPEAKER_17]: That's alright because you know what everyone's going to do.

761
00:54:00,391 --> 00:54:03,313
[SPEAKER_17]: They're just going to rip the songs and make sim files for it.

762
00:54:04,354 --> 00:54:05,055
[SPEAKER_17]: And you won't buy it.

763
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:08,598
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, and you won't buy it if you're in the US.

764
00:54:08,818 --> 00:54:17,265
[SPEAKER_17]: Because, you know, importing those is a little harder because they're in PAL and, you know, it doesn't work too well and you have to have a modded PS2.

765
00:54:17,305 --> 00:54:21,728
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I know everyone out there is just going to rush to get a European PS2.

766
00:54:22,869 --> 00:54:23,690
[SPEAKER_18]: Not me, I'm lazy.

767
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:25,015
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, fuck that.

768
00:54:25,175 --> 00:54:29,236
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'll import Japanese games, but European stuff could... Yeah.

769
00:54:29,977 --> 00:54:30,297
[SPEAKER_17]: Whatever.

770
00:54:30,317 --> 00:54:32,497
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll wait for someone to rip it.

771
00:54:32,517 --> 00:54:34,398
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

772
00:54:36,218 --> 00:54:36,518
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

773
00:54:36,638 --> 00:54:39,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Joe, by the way, we have to offer a word to our sponsors.

774
00:54:39,399 --> 00:54:39,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

775
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,860
[SPEAKER_06]: This episode of Orange Jones Radio is brought to you by Propel.

776
00:54:44,093 --> 00:54:53,561
[SPEAKER_06]: by Pizzeria Pretzel Combos and the El Cerroso Guata Chip, guacamole chips.

777
00:54:53,701 --> 00:54:56,504
[SPEAKER_18]: They're tortilla chips with guacamole already in them.

778
00:54:56,524 --> 00:54:57,985
[SPEAKER_06]: They're chips that are the color of boogers.

779
00:54:58,894 --> 00:55:01,275
[SPEAKER_18]: For those of you... What did you say, Loki?

780
00:55:01,315 --> 00:55:04,277
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki made a funny... It's the guacamole belt chip.

781
00:55:04,697 --> 00:55:05,217
[SPEAKER_18]: Ha ha ha.

782
00:55:05,517 --> 00:55:08,559
[SPEAKER_18]: For those of you too lazy to dip your chips, that's amazing.

783
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:09,359
[SPEAKER_16]: Only in America.

784
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,361
[SPEAKER_18]: We will play Gamma London a couple in a little while.

785
00:55:12,761 --> 00:55:13,061
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

786
00:55:14,622 --> 00:55:15,522
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's do the FUs of the week.

787
00:55:15,542 --> 00:55:16,003
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys ready?

788
00:55:17,483 --> 00:55:18,704
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we got a whole bunch.

789
00:55:18,804 --> 00:55:19,865
[SPEAKER_18]: Chatroom sent me a whole bunch.

790
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:23,446
[SPEAKER_18]: So, plenty of things to rant about tonight.

791
00:55:23,546 --> 00:55:24,527
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's get it started.

792
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:33,269
[SPEAKER_10]: This is fucked up.

793
00:55:34,849 --> 00:55:37,130
[SPEAKER_06]: My first fuck you of the week is for what I mentioned earlier.

794
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:38,591
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what's here at Pacifica Mortgage.

795
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:42,152
[SPEAKER_06]: And in particular, Shanda, who was the supervisor.

796
00:55:42,192 --> 00:55:44,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Her name is Shanda Ramsey-Wallace, and I don't care.

797
00:55:44,573 --> 00:55:45,514
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a professional.

798
00:55:46,854 --> 00:55:48,195
[SPEAKER_06]: She can go burn in hell.

799
00:55:49,195 --> 00:55:51,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I had been asking for feedback.

800
00:55:51,296 --> 00:55:52,116
[SPEAKER_06]: How am I doing?

801
00:55:52,456 --> 00:55:53,757
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you need me to do differently?

802
00:55:54,377 --> 00:55:56,158
[SPEAKER_06]: What can I do to improve what I'm doing?

803
00:55:56,858 --> 00:55:58,459
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, oh no, you're doing fine.

804
00:55:58,499 --> 00:55:59,999
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no.

805
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:00,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like that, by the way.

806
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:05,625
[SPEAKER_06]: and then I get a call at 9 a.m.

807
00:56:05,685 --> 00:56:08,706
[SPEAKER_06]: today saying that I lost my assignment with my job.

808
00:56:09,627 --> 00:56:11,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm going through 10 pages because of, you know.

809
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:18,071
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing about this, I need to go to the doctor really bad and I've needed to go for practically a year now.

810
00:56:19,432 --> 00:56:27,196
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was really, you know, counting on being made permanent this week so that I could go to the doctor and get all that crap taken care of.

811
00:56:27,636 --> 00:56:28,076
[SPEAKER_06]: But no.

812
00:56:28,857 --> 00:56:29,017
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

813
00:56:30,163 --> 00:56:38,449
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I have to say this, is that what I'm going to do when I finally find out what's wrong is I'm going to send her my medical reports and I'm going to say, look, bitch, you can pay for half of this.

814
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:43,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I should probably sue her for, you know, for damages.

815
00:56:43,753 --> 00:56:46,074
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, with our current court system, I'd probably win.

816
00:56:46,955 --> 00:56:49,017
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I'm not that petty.

817
00:56:49,537 --> 00:56:50,358
[SPEAKER_06]: But, no.

818
00:56:50,378 --> 00:56:52,159
[SPEAKER_18]: I like how you add that in there.

819
00:56:52,539 --> 00:56:53,520
[SPEAKER_18]: But, P.S., I'm not that petty.

820
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:56,320
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not petty and fake like she is.

821
00:56:57,001 --> 00:57:06,649
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, her office is toward the front on the opposite side where the UC Davis Medical Center is at 11,000 Olsen Drive in Rancho Cordova.

822
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:09,551
[SPEAKER_06]: It's upstairs on the right side of the building.

823
00:57:09,952 --> 00:57:12,214
[SPEAKER_06]: And her office is the window office.

824
00:57:12,674 --> 00:57:14,676
[SPEAKER_06]: She can go in there and set it on fire.

825
00:57:14,896 --> 00:57:21,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I am technically making a bunch of those very botsy, like the vomit flavor and dirt and sardine on her desk.

826
00:57:22,905 --> 00:57:25,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I am going at 5 in the morning to pick up my stuff.

827
00:57:25,086 --> 00:57:29,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Before she's there, so that I don't have to see her ugly, lying face.

828
00:57:30,048 --> 00:57:30,708
[SPEAKER_06]: But guess what?

829
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:35,250
[SPEAKER_06]: They said the Tempexie apparently likes me so much they're giving me another 7 instantly.

830
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:35,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

831
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:38,571
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing Shikibai.

832
00:57:38,591 --> 00:57:38,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Next.

833
00:57:40,652 --> 00:57:43,113
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on, uh, Loki, what do you have to say?

834
00:57:43,513 --> 00:57:43,874
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh...

835
00:57:46,548 --> 00:57:47,729
[SPEAKER_17]: See, the usual.

836
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:49,691
[SPEAKER_17]: FU to stupid drivers.

837
00:57:49,711 --> 00:57:51,813
[SPEAKER_17]: I had some dumb bitch in front of me today.

838
00:57:51,913 --> 00:57:58,238
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, I don't know who it was, but it was some dumb bitch driving a 30 and a 45.

839
00:57:58,498 --> 00:58:00,740
[SPEAKER_17]: And there was no red lights or anything.

840
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,702
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not like you're slowing down or anything.

841
00:58:02,902 --> 00:58:05,104
[SPEAKER_17]: You're just slowing down for the hell of it.

842
00:58:05,124 --> 00:58:08,287
[SPEAKER_17]: So I got pissed and drove by them and flipped them off.

843
00:58:09,515 --> 00:58:13,137
[SPEAKER_17]: and yelled at them and stuff, even though they couldn't hear me, but it felt good.

844
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:18,440
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, FB the stupid, FB the stupid teenagers that were, uh, at Scandia last night?

845
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:20,101
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, okay, let's see.

846
00:58:20,641 --> 00:58:22,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Number one, you're a nerd.

847
00:58:22,562 --> 00:58:24,263
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, yeah, that's acceptable, okay?

848
00:58:24,323 --> 00:58:25,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Number two, you're not goth.

849
00:58:26,934 --> 00:58:31,117
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't try to be... I don't know what the hell they think, but what's the step of coolness?

850
00:58:31,377 --> 00:58:34,879
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, let's see here, I'm at the bottom rung, so the next thing I gotta be is goth.

851
00:58:35,319 --> 00:58:39,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh wait, um, you know, the whole goth trend, you know, that was so ten years ago.

852
00:58:40,842 --> 00:58:42,923
[SPEAKER_17]: And now you're just annoying, and you look stupid.

853
00:58:42,963 --> 00:58:44,765
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the guy with the wannabe mohawk.

854
00:58:45,225 --> 00:58:50,448
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm gonna spike up my hair in the middle, and it's gonna look like shit, and then I'm gonna be all cool.

855
00:58:50,708 --> 00:58:51,609
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I... yeah.

856
00:58:52,580 --> 00:59:00,222
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's all these kids that are like, wanna be punk, which is sad, because it doesn't take much to be punk, but they're not quite there yet.

857
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,412
[SPEAKER_17]: and then they're playing DDR.

858
00:59:02,632 --> 00:59:08,357
[SPEAKER_17]: And you'd think, okay, these wannabe punk guys, maybe they listen to rock, maybe they're, you know, trying to get through the whole punk scene and that kind of thing.

859
00:59:08,657 --> 00:59:13,241
[SPEAKER_17]: They start playing Nori, Nori, Nori, and fucking, like, you know, shit like that.

860
00:59:13,821 --> 00:59:14,862
[SPEAKER_17]: And it makes no sense.

861
00:59:15,222 --> 00:59:18,024
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just, you're annoying, and you're in my way.

862
00:59:18,044 --> 00:59:21,947
[SPEAKER_17]: So then I had my turn coming up on the machine, because we had a coin line, it was all fucked up.

863
00:59:21,967 --> 00:59:27,772
[SPEAKER_17]: So I had my turn, this dumb, this dumb, dumbass kid comes up to me, he's like, you know, what was my turn?

864
00:59:28,152 --> 00:59:30,593
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like, fuck you, man, I was waiting for people.

865
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,493
[SPEAKER_17]: I, you know, I counted it and everything.

866
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:36,494
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I don't know if I've been on here, waiting here for two minutes or fifteen minutes.

867
00:59:37,594 --> 00:59:40,475
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like, well, it was my fucking turn.

868
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:41,035
[SPEAKER_17]: Get out of here.

869
00:59:41,355 --> 00:59:42,896
[SPEAKER_17]: So, it's annoying.

870
00:59:43,616 --> 00:59:46,096
[SPEAKER_17]: So, basically, just stupid people at Scandia, because they suck.

871
00:59:46,116 --> 00:59:46,597
[SPEAKER_17]: F you to...

872
00:59:53,386 --> 00:59:58,830
[SPEAKER_17]: F you, this stupid bastard that was there also last night that wanted to do some improv tourney.

873
00:59:59,091 --> 01:00:01,412
[SPEAKER_17]: He's like, dude, let's have a tourney, man, for people.

874
01:00:01,953 --> 01:00:02,433
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah!

875
01:00:03,194 --> 01:00:15,923
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that kid, and he used to try to hang out with me because he thought I was so cool because I played DDR, and I was teaching him little stuff, and now he thinks he's like some DDR god who's always trying to get tournament going everywhere he goes, even if he's by himself.

876
01:00:16,004 --> 01:00:17,645
[SPEAKER_15]: He'll ask random people to tourney with him.

877
01:00:17,665 --> 01:00:18,706
[SPEAKER_17]: You're a dumbass, sir.

878
01:00:19,446 --> 01:00:25,472
[SPEAKER_17]: You're just like that stupid cowboy skater guy who didn't know what a syringe was.

879
01:00:26,032 --> 01:00:27,974
[SPEAKER_17]: You're lower than him, okay?

880
01:00:28,975 --> 01:00:31,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Sad, pathetic person, you.

881
01:00:32,118 --> 01:00:34,140
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see what else we've got on the list here.

882
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,741
[SPEAKER_17]: I know there's a bunch of shit.

883
01:00:36,822 --> 01:00:40,086
[SPEAKER_17]: F you to the police, because I don't know why it takes about eight people to...

884
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:44,569
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for giving out my address on air, I appreciate that.

885
01:00:44,589 --> 01:00:44,869
[SPEAKER_17]: Just kidding.

886
01:00:58,837 --> 01:00:59,698
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm kidding, God.

887
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:01,160
[SPEAKER_18]: I took a street.

888
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:03,162
[SPEAKER_16]: What the hell, man?

889
01:01:04,443 --> 01:01:05,905
[SPEAKER_17]: Fucking A, dude, that's stupid.

890
01:01:06,706 --> 01:01:14,274
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, so they're just... I don't understand, they're like complaining, we don't have enough money to, you know, support our police force and it's understaffed and...

891
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:15,689
[SPEAKER_16]: What the fuck?

892
01:01:15,729 --> 01:01:21,073
[SPEAKER_16]: You have like eight people traveling around here, you know, pulling over speeders in a traffic area.

893
01:01:21,393 --> 01:01:24,335
[SPEAKER_16]: You're not going to speed if there's cars in front of you, you dumbasses.

894
01:01:24,836 --> 01:01:29,519
[SPEAKER_16]: Why don't you do something important like stop robberies or drive by punchings or something like that?

895
01:01:29,979 --> 01:01:32,621
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, something like, do something.

896
01:01:33,061 --> 01:01:39,866
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, um, FD to my website for the FTP being slow and, uh, yeah.

897
01:01:39,886 --> 01:01:43,709
[SPEAKER_17]: That's hostones.com so they can go fuck themselves and, uh,

898
01:01:45,717 --> 01:01:50,040
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, that's all I have right now because my memory's kind of going at the moment.

899
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:53,962
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't think of anything, so I'm sure it'll come.

900
01:01:53,982 --> 01:01:54,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Next.

901
01:01:54,982 --> 01:01:56,043
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, my turn.

902
01:01:58,844 --> 01:02:00,545
[SPEAKER_18]: My FUs of the week are pretty short.

903
01:02:01,506 --> 01:02:05,608
[SPEAKER_18]: My first FU of the week goes to Loki Sim.

904
01:02:06,048 --> 01:02:08,169
[SPEAKER_18]: Because last night at the party, I didn't get to play it at all.

905
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:10,030
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I was too drunk.

906
01:02:11,431 --> 01:02:12,132
[SPEAKER_17]: Why is it my Sim's fault?

907
01:02:12,172 --> 01:02:14,453
[SPEAKER_18]: I really wanted to play it too, and I didn't get to.

908
01:02:15,731 --> 01:02:18,352
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, then F everybody else who played, because I didn't get to play.

909
01:02:18,732 --> 01:02:20,812
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, oh, oh, wait, thank you for reminding me.

910
01:02:20,872 --> 01:02:24,453
[SPEAKER_18]: And I even remember saying in a drunken stupor, I want to play!

911
01:02:24,473 --> 01:02:27,373
[SPEAKER_17]: I have one more, I just remembered.

912
01:02:27,693 --> 01:02:28,074
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh-oh.

913
01:02:28,114 --> 01:02:30,954
[SPEAKER_17]: F you the Cypher gamepads, because they suck ass.

914
01:02:31,494 --> 01:02:40,496
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, what the hell's the point of putting freaking... They've got, I don't even know what kind of gauge of sheet metal they have underneath it, but there's no fucking way it's going to hold any sort of weight whatsoever.

915
01:02:40,896 --> 01:02:44,557
[SPEAKER_17]: I took the feet off the bottom of these things so they wouldn't bend, and they still fucking bend.

916
01:02:44,797 --> 01:02:44,957
[SPEAKER_17]: They're

917
01:02:45,774 --> 01:02:47,835
[SPEAKER_17]: and the wires started coming out of the fucking arrows.

918
01:02:47,935 --> 01:02:51,556
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like, shit man, I thought my pads were built really shitty.

919
01:02:51,877 --> 01:02:55,918
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I look at my pads and I'm like, oh my god, man, I just totally fucked those up.

920
01:02:56,198 --> 01:03:02,341
[SPEAKER_17]: But now these are just really fucked up, so... Yeah, don't buy Cypher game pads if you're gonna buy them online.

921
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:03,701
[SPEAKER_17]: Buy anyone else's.

922
01:03:03,721 --> 01:03:04,702
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just not theirs.

923
01:03:07,521 --> 01:03:07,801
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

924
01:03:08,822 --> 01:03:10,363
[SPEAKER_18]: A quick question in the chat room.

925
01:03:10,423 --> 01:03:13,966
[SPEAKER_18]: Wonder what someone would like trying to play DDR when they're really, really drunk.

926
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:17,229
[SPEAKER_18]: Last time I was in Vegas, I did that at Circus Circus.

927
01:03:17,269 --> 01:03:19,711
[SPEAKER_18]: I got really fucked up at the Star Trek experience.

928
01:03:21,118 --> 01:03:21,639
[SPEAKER_04]: I did that too.

929
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,822
[SPEAKER_18]: I played Afronova Trick on the machine that's right in the middle of like the little kid area.

930
01:03:43,202 --> 01:03:44,683
[SPEAKER_18]: That's like, you know, above the casino.

931
01:03:44,723 --> 01:03:47,925
[SPEAKER_18]: They kind of have like the little kid area where all the kiddies can play arcade games.

932
01:03:48,185 --> 01:03:53,288
[SPEAKER_18]: I played Afronova Trick up there and went promptly back up to the hotel room and threw up in the tub.

933
01:03:53,308 --> 01:03:59,091
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I realized when I was in Reno and I was at the Atlantis and I played their Max 2 machine.

934
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:02,313
[SPEAKER_15]: I play better when I'm drunk than when I'm not drunk.

935
01:04:02,913 --> 01:04:06,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I was, uh, I was, it was the DDR Freak Moderator's trip.

936
01:04:07,742 --> 01:04:09,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Me, an iguana girl, and Islander.

937
01:04:10,343 --> 01:04:14,285
[SPEAKER_06]: All three of us and two of my friends were there who lived in Las Vegas.

938
01:04:15,046 --> 01:04:18,868
[SPEAKER_06]: At this Star Trek experience, between the three of us, we had three warp core breaches.

939
01:04:21,309 --> 01:04:22,449
[SPEAKER_06]: And, no, two and a half.

940
01:04:22,469 --> 01:04:23,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Two and a half.

941
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:25,431
[SPEAKER_06]: And we went on the ride.

942
01:04:27,518 --> 01:04:34,228
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we took a cab over to Circus Circus and played on the USA machine that was up there.

943
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:37,173
[SPEAKER_06]: With the broken arrows on the right side.

944
01:04:37,193 --> 01:04:38,255
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was trying to do Love to Me.

945
01:04:41,448 --> 01:04:44,189
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, like, we called, um, Understood Nation Live.

946
01:04:44,209 --> 01:04:45,629
[SPEAKER_06]: The voicemail, because we were drunk.

947
01:04:45,889 --> 01:04:48,230
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, one more F for you, just remember it again.

948
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:51,131
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck you to the stupid DDR Extreme Roulette.

949
01:04:52,431 --> 01:04:57,533
[SPEAKER_17]: Seven times yesterday, I got one away from The Legend of Max, and it wouldn't fucking give it to me!

950
01:04:57,973 --> 01:05:01,214
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got the timing down perfect, yet you won't give it to me!

951
01:05:01,694 --> 01:05:04,435
[SPEAKER_17]: Why even fucking have it in the roulette if you're not gonna give it to me?!

952
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:09,677
[SPEAKER_17]: You stupid assholes, I can't wait two weeks to play the damn song, I wanna play it now!

953
01:05:11,015 --> 01:05:17,718
[SPEAKER_17]: I wouldn't play Roulette so you know I could get Cutie Chaser five times for freaking White Lovers or whatever the fuck that stupid song is.

954
01:05:18,018 --> 01:05:19,059
[SPEAKER_17]: It sucks ass.

955
01:05:19,439 --> 01:05:20,459
[SPEAKER_17]: It shouldn't be in there.

956
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,200
[SPEAKER_18]: Tell us what you really think, Loki.

957
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:26,222
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah, Cutie Chaser Morning Mix.

958
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:30,104
[SPEAKER_17]: Why did they take anything from OHA, you know, DDR?

959
01:05:30,204 --> 01:05:31,584
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just dumb.

960
01:05:31,604 --> 01:05:33,145
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you say Omaha DDR?

961
01:05:33,325 --> 01:05:34,426
[SPEAKER_18]: OHA, you dumbass!

962
01:05:36,286 --> 01:05:37,146
[SPEAKER_18]: Not Omaha.

963
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:39,487
[SPEAKER_18]: I swear to God, I thought you said Omaha.

964
01:05:39,887 --> 01:05:41,348
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm like, hey, we got friends there.

965
01:05:41,768 --> 01:05:45,769
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, do you know of a DDR Omaha mix?

966
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:48,870
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you know of one?

967
01:05:49,751 --> 01:05:55,593
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I thought you said, and I'm like, in my mind, I'm like, God, Loki's a retard.

968
01:05:55,613 --> 01:05:57,033
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no Omaha mix.

969
01:06:00,394 --> 01:06:02,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob's still drunk in his head.

970
01:06:03,435 --> 01:06:04,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob's still drunk.

971
01:06:04,416 --> 01:06:05,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm taking over.

972
01:06:06,647 --> 01:06:08,849
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Rob's too drunk to be a host.

973
01:06:09,369 --> 01:06:11,831
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'm not doing my FUs yet, lady.

974
01:06:18,338 --> 01:06:19,520
[SPEAKER_18]: I forgot to finish that story.

975
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:30,150
[SPEAKER_18]: When you play DDR drunk, it's like, every time you jump, I remember, because Africa of a Trick has that part where you go, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-hey, and you jump really high, you know, that's the cool newbie thing to do.

976
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:31,251
[SPEAKER_18]: So I was doing that.

977
01:06:31,511 --> 01:06:36,476
[SPEAKER_18]: And, like, I just remember, like, you jump up, and it's like, I'm flying, and then you come down like a rock.

978
01:06:37,477 --> 01:06:38,939
[SPEAKER_18]: That's how it's different when you're drunk.

979
01:06:38,979 --> 01:06:39,700
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all I remember.

980
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:45,805
[SPEAKER_06]: When I do this, I always spin on them, and I get really dizzy.

981
01:06:45,885 --> 01:06:48,988
[SPEAKER_06]: I played drunk on your old pads.

982
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:50,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was funny.

983
01:06:50,469 --> 01:06:52,171
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd also like to give an F you to lack of sex.

984
01:06:52,251 --> 01:06:52,531
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

985
01:06:52,991 --> 01:06:57,075
[SPEAKER_17]: My boy played drunk on my pads, and he fell over, and that was funny.

986
01:06:57,896 --> 01:07:01,079
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, let's get to the rest of the room, shall we?

987
01:07:02,992 --> 01:07:03,552
[SPEAKER_18]: Who's first?

988
01:07:03,572 --> 01:07:06,233
[SPEAKER_15]: Who else is first?

989
01:07:06,654 --> 01:07:07,154
[SPEAKER_18]: You're first.

990
01:07:07,174 --> 01:07:07,234
[SPEAKER_18]: Go.

991
01:07:07,414 --> 01:07:09,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, um, a couple FUs.

992
01:07:09,355 --> 01:07:13,257
[SPEAKER_15]: One of them is to these guaca chips because they taste like guaca shit.

993
01:07:14,617 --> 01:07:16,478
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't care if anybody else likes them.

994
01:07:16,718 --> 01:07:17,999
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they taste like crap.

995
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,800
[SPEAKER_15]: Combos are fucking good.

996
01:07:22,401 --> 01:07:22,821
[SPEAKER_15]: Eat one.

997
01:07:23,246 --> 01:07:25,248
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, eat like eight, okay?

998
01:07:25,788 --> 01:07:31,674
[SPEAKER_15]: No, anyways, um, another FQ I have is, of course, to the little punk, wannabe punk brigade over at Scandia.

999
01:07:31,974 --> 01:07:39,482
[SPEAKER_15]: They're stupid and annoying, they don't know what the hell a coin system is, and they think they're really cool because they can pass, like, exotic ethnic on light.

1000
01:07:40,843 --> 01:07:43,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you trying to get Legend of Max on roulette?

1001
01:07:45,067 --> 01:07:46,008
[SPEAKER_15]: No, not at all.

1002
01:07:47,472 --> 01:07:52,999
[SPEAKER_15]: And yeah, especially that little mohawk kid comes up to me four fucking times after I tell him every new time.

1003
01:07:53,339 --> 01:07:54,961
[SPEAKER_15]: So how does a token line work?

1004
01:07:55,782 --> 01:07:57,684
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, just put your damn token up there.

1005
01:07:57,724 --> 01:07:59,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Four times, I just walked off.

1006
01:07:59,166 --> 01:08:00,608
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't even say anything.

1007
01:08:01,969 --> 01:08:02,991
[SPEAKER_17]: Whose tokens are those?

1008
01:08:03,031 --> 01:08:03,952
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I want to take them.

1009
01:08:05,564 --> 01:08:08,448
[SPEAKER_15]: I just said there were some guys, so they didn't take it.

1010
01:08:08,628 --> 01:08:12,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Another FU I have is to, we'll call them drunk kids.

1011
01:08:13,353 --> 01:08:19,560
[SPEAKER_15]: Last night at the party, some kids were trying to get drunk, and it was really stupid, and I'm going to kill them whenever I find them.

1012
01:08:22,678 --> 01:08:29,224
[SPEAKER_15]: And another one is to those, yeah, to those fucking pads, because they should be, like, registered as lethal weapons.

1013
01:08:29,844 --> 01:08:35,629
[SPEAKER_15]: I moved the fucking pad twice, and I got cut four times because the sheet metal is so sharp on the side.

1014
01:08:35,649 --> 01:08:41,414
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, I was sitting there on the pad, and all of a sudden I just noticed I was bleeding on my hand for no reason.

1015
01:08:42,299 --> 01:08:47,042
[SPEAKER_17]: Not to mention that, but the fact that the pads are bent in half, that the one side doesn't really work too well.

1016
01:08:48,503 --> 01:08:51,905
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is, it got bent in half just from one game of playing on them.

1017
01:08:52,425 --> 01:08:58,229
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, that and the fact that the wires are coming out, and yeah, that's that.

1018
01:09:00,419 --> 01:09:13,288
[SPEAKER_15]: One last one is to Bel Air for having fucking two things left of the Smirnoff Triple Black and one of them is missing a fucking bottle and so we can only get one and have to resort to like substituting.

1019
01:09:13,668 --> 01:09:17,991
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the worst thing ever and that's all because I don't want to talk no more.

1020
01:09:18,011 --> 01:09:18,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Next.

1021
01:09:22,274 --> 01:09:23,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it's my turn.

1022
01:09:24,636 --> 01:09:27,217
[SPEAKER_03]: First, hi, DarkSakura, thanks for saying hello.

1023
01:09:27,237 --> 01:09:29,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Irene, how are you?

1024
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:30,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you out there?

1025
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,401
[SPEAKER_18]: Not angsty enough.

1026
01:09:33,521 --> 01:09:37,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my plushies aren't that great, but here we go.

1027
01:09:39,847 --> 01:09:41,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, okay, we'll start with that.

1028
01:09:41,908 --> 01:09:45,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you to laundromats, because going to laundromats is not fun.

1029
01:09:46,809 --> 01:09:51,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Today was my first experience in years to go to a laundromat, and it wasn't too bad.

1030
01:09:51,431 --> 01:09:57,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in a hurry, though, so it just kind of sucks having to share your laundry with the whole world.

1031
01:09:57,773 --> 01:10:00,254
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, back to other things.

1032
01:10:00,834 --> 01:10:01,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you to my computer.

1033
01:10:02,755 --> 01:10:03,955
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not working properly.

1034
01:10:04,275 --> 01:10:06,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get it to work hardly at all.

1035
01:10:07,897 --> 01:10:30,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, okay, thanks to me, I did my good deed for the week, I gave 0x my extra 32 megabytes of RAM for his computer, which only had 32 megabytes of RAM, so I gave him an extra one, and now it has 64 megabytes of RAM, and now it works nicely, so that's my good deed for the week.

1036
01:10:31,904 --> 01:10:34,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, it was like, yeah, it was extra.

1037
01:10:35,045 --> 01:10:35,345
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

1038
01:10:37,543 --> 01:10:40,044
[SPEAKER_03]: You have 512 megabytes of RAM.

1039
01:10:40,084 --> 01:10:41,124
[SPEAKER_06]: I have 512 in my old computer.

1040
01:10:41,584 --> 01:10:44,845
[SPEAKER_06]: My current one is like 80-something DDR RAM now.

1041
01:10:45,285 --> 01:10:46,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, that's nice.

1042
01:10:46,705 --> 01:10:48,506
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a game.

1043
01:10:49,386 --> 01:10:49,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1044
01:10:51,106 --> 01:11:04,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, right now my computer is not functioning, and I think there's a virus on it, and I can't tell, because I can't get online yet, but I don't know how to figure it out.

1045
01:11:04,429 --> 01:11:06,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Your computer has never had a virus scanner?

1046
01:11:07,647 --> 01:11:11,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I got something stupid on there, but I'll have to figure it out.

1047
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:19,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, and fuck you to the Kmart on Stockton Avenue, because they have... Stockton Boulevard, excuse me.

1048
01:11:20,835 --> 01:11:23,577
[SPEAKER_03]: There are people that work there that really suck.

1049
01:11:23,597 --> 01:11:26,739
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't do anything, and they never have enough people at the cash register.

1050
01:11:28,849 --> 01:11:30,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I know, it's a Kmart.

1051
01:11:30,209 --> 01:11:32,590
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going downhill fast.

1052
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:41,172
[SPEAKER_03]: And fuck you to guys, and I won't say why, I just hate guys, and guys suck.

1053
01:11:41,192 --> 01:11:43,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to all you guys out there who are decent guys.

1054
01:11:45,032 --> 01:11:48,633
[SPEAKER_03]: But guys who really suck, fuck you.

1055
01:11:48,693 --> 01:11:51,254
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, fuck you to lack of sex.

1056
01:11:51,654 --> 01:11:52,934
[SPEAKER_18]: Guys who suck, here's my number.

1057
01:11:54,854 --> 01:11:55,675
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm done.

1058
01:11:56,295 --> 01:11:56,955
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your name?

1059
01:11:59,574 --> 01:12:00,514
[SPEAKER_14]: Ice Queen.

1060
01:12:01,215 --> 01:12:03,756
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to agree with Rob's fuck you to lack of sex.

1061
01:12:03,776 --> 01:12:06,577
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been so long, I don't even remember what a penis looks like.

1062
01:12:06,637 --> 01:12:08,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Except my own.

1063
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:15,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, great, that's lovely, thank you.

1064
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:24,984
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, I have to back up Jamie's fuck you to her boss, because bosses everywhere suck, and they should all be freaking tarred and feathered and thrown out into the street naked.

1065
01:12:26,994 --> 01:12:30,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, with the exception of Loki's boss, because I guess Loki's boss rocks.

1066
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:38,470
[SPEAKER_14]: But other than that, fuck not having a computer and fuck not having... Well, actually, fuck having a job, period.

1067
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:41,574
[SPEAKER_14]: And having to have a job to make money.

1068
01:12:42,556 --> 01:12:44,058
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's about it this week.

1069
01:12:48,266 --> 01:12:50,487
[SPEAKER_15]: You say fuck having a job.

1070
01:12:50,527 --> 01:12:52,307
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I say fuck not having a job?

1071
01:12:52,628 --> 01:12:53,408
[SPEAKER_14]: I should rephrase that.

1072
01:12:53,488 --> 01:12:55,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck having to have a job to have money.

1073
01:12:55,388 --> 01:12:56,849
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I say fuck having your job?

1074
01:12:57,229 --> 01:12:57,889
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that too.

1075
01:12:58,129 --> 01:12:58,489
[SPEAKER_15]: That works.

1076
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:01,110
[SPEAKER_06]: People need to pay me because I'm cool.

1077
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:05,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Pay me for the privilege of being in my presence.

1078
01:13:05,412 --> 01:13:06,832
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just going to become a porn star.

1079
01:13:06,872 --> 01:13:07,372
[SPEAKER_18]: You know why?

1080
01:13:07,693 --> 01:13:09,973
[SPEAKER_18]: Because you're getting paid to have sex.

1081
01:13:11,634 --> 01:13:14,235
[SPEAKER_18]: That's two of my big problems right there.

1082
01:13:16,121 --> 01:13:18,982
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to go by the point and see Robin.

1083
01:13:21,803 --> 01:13:27,844
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you'd see my dick on the cover, so you know you'd be all, I better stay away from this, Rob's naked on the cover.

1084
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:30,425
[SPEAKER_06]: What if you're one of the extras?

1085
01:13:30,445 --> 01:13:33,846
[SPEAKER_18]: I am much better than a fluff boy.

1086
01:13:35,147 --> 01:13:36,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone has to start somewhere.

1087
01:13:38,327 --> 01:13:38,668
[SPEAKER_18]: Whatever.

1088
01:13:40,348 --> 01:13:42,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Even Ron Jeremy makes cameos now.

1089
01:13:42,189 --> 01:13:43,569
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there anything else?

1090
01:13:44,366 --> 01:13:45,067
[SPEAKER_14]: Ninja Usagi Koei

1091
01:14:07,501 --> 01:14:08,221
[SPEAKER_18]: Our first F.U.

1092
01:14:08,241 --> 01:14:10,902
[SPEAKER_18]: goes to rocks in the woods that aren't fat people friendly.

1093
01:14:11,842 --> 01:14:14,263
[SPEAKER_18]: The second will go to Namco for no free play.

1094
01:14:14,303 --> 01:14:14,823
[SPEAKER_18]: They suck.

1095
01:14:15,503 --> 01:14:22,745
[SPEAKER_18]: The third will go to all politicians for being so fucking stupid and sending us to war and just ignoring other possibilities because they're so fucking power hungry.

1096
01:14:23,245 --> 01:14:24,685
[SPEAKER_18]: Arigato, Hanemate.

1097
01:14:25,325 --> 01:14:25,485
[SPEAKER_17]: F.U.

1098
01:14:25,505 --> 01:14:26,546
[SPEAKER_17]: to Freedom Fries!

1099
01:14:28,866 --> 01:14:29,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1100
01:14:37,358 --> 01:14:37,718
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on.

1101
01:14:38,859 --> 01:14:44,081
[SPEAKER_18]: Satome Ranma says... Oh, I got the link to the video.

1102
01:14:44,141 --> 01:14:44,941
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll do that next week.

1103
01:14:45,262 --> 01:14:46,402
[SPEAKER_18]: You gonna draw on that?

1104
01:14:46,422 --> 01:14:46,642
[SPEAKER_18]: Fine.

1105
01:14:47,723 --> 01:14:55,987
[SPEAKER_18]: Says, alright, my FU of the week goes to 2DX for being so far away from me, to 2DX for being so hard, and to 2DX for having so many vague songs on it.

1106
01:14:56,687 --> 01:14:58,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember what that used to be like.

1107
01:14:58,848 --> 01:14:59,448
[SPEAKER_18]: Vague.

1108
01:15:00,268 --> 01:15:01,789
[SPEAKER_18]: That's an interesting way of phrasing it, vague.

1109
01:15:01,929 --> 01:15:02,189
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1110
01:15:05,031 --> 01:15:05,571
[SPEAKER_18]: Mulheimer.

1111
01:15:07,537 --> 01:15:12,418
[SPEAKER_18]: Mulheimer says, fuck people being dumbasses and talking about everyone behind their backs and being dumb like that.

1112
01:15:12,958 --> 01:15:13,978
[SPEAKER_18]: You must be in high school.

1113
01:15:14,658 --> 01:15:19,119
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck gay lifeguarding classes that took up my Friday night and Saturday and Sunday afternoons.

1114
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:24,880
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait, where can I sign up to be a gay lifeguard?

1115
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:25,600
[SPEAKER_18]: That's awesome.

1116
01:15:28,421 --> 01:15:33,682
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck Sundays and fuck having to decide my courses for next year already.

1117
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:38,451
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, that's kind of crazy.

1118
01:15:38,471 --> 01:15:39,852
[SPEAKER_18]: Because Church is boring.

1119
01:15:45,995 --> 01:15:49,017
[SPEAKER_17]: Doo-dee-doo-dee-doo, no one can hear you, except for me.

1120
01:15:50,978 --> 01:15:53,339
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, moving on, sorry.

1121
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,082
[SPEAKER_18]: Justin Circuit says, my FU goes to people who get in Jamie's way when she drives.

1122
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:03,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie is my hero.

1123
01:16:06,629 --> 01:16:07,030
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1124
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:10,893
[SPEAKER_18]: Japanman says, Fuck my family for not supporting my DDR efforts.

1125
01:16:11,574 --> 01:16:14,016
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck DDR for not having Cool7 on Extreme.

1126
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:21,542
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck Texas for Daikinkai being the number one song everywhere, so when I play it for my first time, I get bashed because all the dudes are tired of it.

1127
01:16:21,962 --> 01:16:23,624
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck the DDR dudes in my city, too.

1128
01:16:24,044 --> 01:16:26,146
[SPEAKER_18]: Ooh, and play Skagogo on one of your breaks, please.

1129
01:16:26,706 --> 01:16:27,047
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

1130
01:16:27,867 --> 01:16:28,228
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

1131
01:16:31,543 --> 01:16:33,184
[SPEAKER_18]: F you to the DMV for failing me.

1132
01:16:33,284 --> 01:16:34,344
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1133
01:16:34,404 --> 01:16:36,045
[SPEAKER_18]: This is from Skyline DC 505.

1134
01:16:36,705 --> 01:16:41,568
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck you to the DMV for failing me during the drive test for a dangerous maneuver.

1135
01:16:42,068 --> 01:16:43,228
[SPEAKER_18]: Stupid, stupid bitches.

1136
01:16:43,268 --> 01:16:44,569
[SPEAKER_18]: And fuck you to Little Kids of Scandia.

1137
01:16:45,249 --> 01:16:48,491
[SPEAKER_18]: I would like to request more information on what that dangerous maneuver was.

1138
01:16:49,091 --> 01:16:50,392
[SPEAKER_18]: So send that over, please.

1139
01:16:51,312 --> 01:17:04,248
[SPEAKER_18]: Dr. Tuya says, continued FU to being single, I need a date, dammit, and fuck banging my foot on the vacuum, it freaking hurts and fuck the United States Postal Service, Angel Snail Mail didn't arrive yesterday I haven't gotten any either

1140
01:17:06,218 --> 01:17:08,880
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought it was hilarious, I was laughing my ass off during that video.

1141
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:12,842
[SPEAKER_18]: Well you're a sick fuck.

1142
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:37,359
[SPEAKER_15]: If you ever want to see good comedy, watch any of the Red Asphalts.

1143
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:40,123
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, like, better than Spike and Mike.

1144
01:17:40,644 --> 01:17:42,347
[SPEAKER_17]: They're all, oh my god, it's so horrible!

1145
01:17:42,367 --> 01:17:44,811
[SPEAKER_17]: And they just show a dead person on, like, leading on a steering wheel.

1146
01:17:48,356 --> 01:17:48,537
[SPEAKER_18]: True.

1147
01:17:49,355 --> 01:17:52,137
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck you to the little kids who told the people at my table to shut up.

1148
01:17:52,658 --> 01:17:58,563
[SPEAKER_18]: The only person that can tell me to shut up is the fucking teacher, not some stuck-up, cousin-humping piece of shit that lives in Natomas.

1149
01:17:58,583 --> 01:17:59,003
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck them.

1150
01:17:59,664 --> 01:18:05,989
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, fuck you to that stupid shitwad that thinks judo is kicking someone in the nuts as hard as you can and then throwing their limp body over you.

1151
01:18:06,329 --> 01:18:08,631
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not judo, that's fucking mental retardation.

1152
01:18:08,651 --> 01:18:09,872
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, that's ghetto judo, man.

1153
01:18:09,892 --> 01:18:12,295
[SPEAKER_18]: My balls still fucking hurt, so fuck you, buddy.

1154
01:18:14,349 --> 01:18:18,211
[SPEAKER_18]: and fuck you to the fucking asshole bassoon player that left me all alone in my orchestra.

1155
01:18:18,571 --> 01:18:23,653
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to play all of my parts alone and I can't play contrabassoon because we won't have a regular bassoon if I did.

1156
01:18:24,313 --> 01:18:26,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, if your band has a contrabassoon clarinet, I'll play it.

1157
01:18:27,375 --> 01:18:27,915
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll volunteer.

1158
01:18:28,355 --> 01:18:29,976
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck him right in his little bitch ass ear.

1159
01:18:30,016 --> 01:18:31,356
[SPEAKER_18]: I fucking hate his worthless ass.

1160
01:18:31,416 --> 01:18:33,777
[SPEAKER_18]: Fucking shack of shit, fuck it, fuck it all, fuck.

1161
01:18:34,598 --> 01:18:36,058
[SPEAKER_18]: Bloody fucking hell, fuck it all.

01:18:37,099 --> 01:18:37,439
[SPEAKER_18]: Beautiful.

1165
01:19:07,011 --> 01:19:08,452
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't even, did I even get the first ones?

1166
01:19:08,492 --> 01:19:09,953
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't remember reading BlackLab FUs.

1167
01:19:11,754 --> 01:19:14,596
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, he says number six, I don't remember seeing one through five, but whatever.

1168
01:19:15,437 --> 01:19:22,643
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, fuck the shitty internet connection in the dorms, and uh, fuck Chipotle burritos, they're too damn good, I had them four times this week.

1169
01:19:23,784 --> 01:19:26,446
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck this whole Chipotle trend, okay.

1170
01:19:27,739 --> 01:19:30,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the Chipotle burritos, but you know what?

1171
01:19:30,341 --> 01:19:31,722
[SPEAKER_06]: They make me sick every time I eat them.

1172
01:19:32,223 --> 01:19:33,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't it pronounced Chipotle?

1173
01:19:34,925 --> 01:19:36,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Chipotle or something like that?

1174
01:19:36,386 --> 01:19:36,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1175
01:19:37,687 --> 01:19:40,449
[SPEAKER_18]: Anybody seen that one Jack in the Box commercial?

1176
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:42,271
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

1177
01:19:42,311 --> 01:19:44,493
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR Mike would like to say, fuck you to Concord.

1178
01:19:49,637 --> 01:19:50,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, Concord.

1179
01:19:51,258 --> 01:19:55,442
[SPEAKER_18]: Skyline says that his dangerous maneuver was that he messed up in a left turn.

1180
01:19:57,478 --> 01:19:58,018
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, what did you do?

1181
01:19:58,038 --> 01:19:59,959
[SPEAKER_18]: You turned right in a left turn or something?

1182
01:20:01,479 --> 01:20:03,880
[SPEAKER_18]: Or did you try to turn left from the right turn lane?

1183
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:06,540
[SPEAKER_14]: What kind of humorous stuff is that?

1184
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:11,261
[SPEAKER_14]: When you turn left and you're with a driving instructor, you're not supposed to power slide.

1185
01:20:12,422 --> 01:20:17,843
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I would just like to remind everybody out there that real life driving is not like initial D. You don't want to drift.

1186
01:20:21,778 --> 01:20:22,318
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1187
01:20:22,438 --> 01:20:28,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything that I learned... It was funny, the whole time I was taking JB home, I'm like, okay, what I just did, don't do that.

1188
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:32,141
[SPEAKER_06]: That turn that I made in the middle of the road, you don't want to do that.

1189
01:20:32,281 --> 01:20:32,761
[SPEAKER_06]: That's illegal.

1190
01:20:38,722 --> 01:20:41,703
[SPEAKER_18]: Jonas sent us some lovely FUs over email.

1191
01:20:42,423 --> 01:20:43,003
[SPEAKER_18]: Explicits.

1192
01:20:43,283 --> 01:20:44,724
[SPEAKER_18]: You might know him by, he's been on the show before.

1193
01:20:44,764 --> 01:20:45,764
[SPEAKER_18]: He says, fuck you to my...

1194
01:20:49,429 --> 01:20:52,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Our best thoughts for him at this moment right now.

1195
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:55,931
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, definitely.

1196
01:20:56,031 --> 01:20:59,712
[SPEAKER_18]: But he would like to help console himself through that by doing a little bit of venting.

1197
01:20:59,792 --> 01:21:01,353
[SPEAKER_18]: He says, F you to my Calc teacher.

1198
01:21:01,433 --> 01:21:03,233
[SPEAKER_18]: And he draws the little ASCII middle finger.

1199
01:21:03,694 --> 01:21:08,895
[SPEAKER_18]: She does not understand what I was going through and told me there's no chance I have to pass the class, so I decided to withdraw.

1200
01:21:09,235 --> 01:21:09,915
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't believe this.

1201
01:21:09,935 --> 01:21:16,718
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just sick to fail a person whose dad just passed away and missed a midterm.

1202
01:21:16,738 --> 01:21:17,538
[SPEAKER_18]: So fuck her for that.

1203
01:21:18,278 --> 01:21:22,302
[SPEAKER_18]: And another F you to the asshole who was pissing me off so badly at a situation like this.

1204
01:21:22,723 --> 01:21:26,046
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I told him I wasn't in the mood to get pissed off, but he intended to do so anyway.

1205
01:21:26,086 --> 01:21:27,107
[SPEAKER_18]: That's just disgraceful.

1206
01:21:27,547 --> 01:21:32,392
[SPEAKER_18]: As much as I want to rip his skull so bad, the teacher was there, and I don't want to get in trouble from the cops.

1207
01:21:32,512 --> 01:21:35,275
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, F you to the cops because they won't let me rip this asshole apart.

1208
01:21:35,835 --> 01:21:36,796
[SPEAKER_18]: Saying I'd be arrested.

1209
01:21:38,438 --> 01:21:40,340
[SPEAKER_18]: He'll be gone for a little while, but not retired.

1210
01:21:42,116 --> 01:21:45,997
[SPEAKER_06]: You know the whole deal with the midterm, I'm assuming that's college courses?

1211
01:21:46,257 --> 01:21:50,799
[SPEAKER_06]: You can take that up with the dean of that particular college and they should take care of it.

1212
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:57,441
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, some good advice from Jamie, because Jamie knows how to kick ass and take names.

1213
01:21:59,372 --> 01:22:01,274
[SPEAKER_18]: Black Lab, we got the other FUs.

1214
01:22:01,374 --> 01:22:03,556
[SPEAKER_18]: He says, fuck my upcoming finals, they suck.

1215
01:22:03,616 --> 01:22:04,457
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck legal battles.

1216
01:22:04,537 --> 01:22:10,643
[SPEAKER_18]: My girlfriend's plans to visit me during her spring break are currently fucked over because her aunt is in legal trouble with her business.

1217
01:22:11,123 --> 01:22:14,827
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck the engineering two building computer labs for closing at 10pm on Friday nights.

1218
01:22:15,187 --> 01:22:18,070
[SPEAKER_18]: I had a project due at midnight that I couldn't finish because they closed early.

1219
01:22:21,724 --> 01:22:22,925
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck flat bike tires.

1220
01:22:22,985 --> 01:22:28,992
[SPEAKER_18]: I got one on Friday night and on my way home from working on my project, thus forcing me to walk a good distance in the rain and dark.

1221
01:22:29,412 --> 01:22:30,413
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck power outages.

1222
01:22:30,533 --> 01:22:33,176
[SPEAKER_18]: One happened Friday night and it screwed up my computer and iPod settings.

1223
01:22:35,378 --> 01:22:39,943
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, and Skyline says he didn't see the oncoming traffic when he made the left turn.

1224
01:22:39,963 --> 01:22:42,326
[SPEAKER_18]: That's awesome.

1225
01:22:46,821 --> 01:22:50,403
[SPEAKER_18]: Justin Circuit wants to add F you to Comcast for still not fixing my email.

1226
01:22:50,443 --> 01:22:53,004
[SPEAKER_18]: If this next request doesn't fix it, ah.

1227
01:22:55,365 --> 01:22:57,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I told you what you need to do with them.

1228
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:59,347
[SPEAKER_06]: You just let me call them, okay?

1229
01:22:59,547 --> 01:23:00,608
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get your email back.

1230
01:23:00,888 --> 01:23:01,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me call them.

1231
01:23:03,589 --> 01:23:12,734
[SPEAKER_18]: And last but certainly not least, we have MinikinigoJazz for saying, Fuck you to teachers who complain about noise in the hallways.

1232
01:23:12,834 --> 01:23:15,015
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want quiet, close your fucking door.

1233
01:23:16,875 --> 01:23:22,921
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, if you don't like noise, you probably shouldn't be teaching because it's too loud.

1234
01:23:23,061 --> 01:23:31,109
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that remark about teachers not teaching, if they didn't teach, they wouldn't be able to do anything because you figure they're teachers because they can't make it doing what it is that they teach.

1235
01:23:31,170 --> 01:23:32,191
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my high school teachers...

1236
01:23:33,052 --> 01:23:34,013
[SPEAKER_06]: and so on.

1237
01:23:51,993 --> 01:23:55,575
[SPEAKER_06]: And see, everyone really didn't care for her just because she was so nuts already.

1238
01:23:56,195 --> 01:23:58,136
[SPEAKER_06]: But she left the classroom to go take care of something.

1239
01:23:58,516 --> 01:24:02,038
[SPEAKER_06]: And when she got back, all the students had turned their desks around backwards.

1240
01:24:02,798 --> 01:24:06,220
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I remember correctly, they even moved her desk to the opposite side.

1241
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:08,461
[SPEAKER_06]: When she came in, she had a breakdown.

1242
01:24:09,781 --> 01:24:11,202
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently went on hiatus.

1243
01:24:11,582 --> 01:24:12,183
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's funny.

1244
01:24:12,483 --> 01:24:16,025
[SPEAKER_17]: I've never really had any teaching experience, even though I think that'd be fun.

1245
01:24:16,065 --> 01:24:23,210
[SPEAKER_17]: But I used to do marshaling for Cusar, which is obviously pretty much no work at all, but you have to do a little brief, which is kind of funny.

1246
01:24:23,611 --> 01:24:25,692
[SPEAKER_17]: And I did one for this one girl who's losing her voice.

1247
01:24:25,752 --> 01:24:27,173
[SPEAKER_17]: This is after I quit working there.

1248
01:24:28,789 --> 01:24:35,899
[SPEAKER_17]: But my favorite way I entered the brief because no one was really, everyone was talking, it was, um, SHUT THE FUCK UP!

1249
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:37,582
[SPEAKER_17]: And then everyone was like, huh?

1250
01:24:38,022 --> 01:24:38,223
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

1251
01:24:38,663 --> 01:24:40,546
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I did my brief, yelling at them.

1252
01:24:41,047 --> 01:24:45,133
[SPEAKER_17]: It was cool because I couldn't get fired because I never worked there.

1253
01:24:46,969 --> 01:24:50,890
[SPEAKER_15]: The best teacher thing I ever did was when I was in 8th grade.

1254
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:54,591
[SPEAKER_15]: We had this one teacher, you knew she was like a big druggy.

1255
01:24:54,712 --> 01:24:58,313
[SPEAKER_15]: You could only tell because she would eat sunflower seeds in class and then just fall asleep.

1256
01:25:00,453 --> 01:25:07,496
[SPEAKER_15]: One time we made a big ol' packaging tape and made a big ball out of it and threw it at the chalkboard right behind her head.

1257
01:25:08,296 --> 01:25:09,576
[SPEAKER_15]: She jumped like 10 feet.

1258
01:25:09,856 --> 01:25:14,318
[SPEAKER_15]: And my friend and I personally made it our mission to get her out of the class and we drove her to rehab.

1259
01:25:15,418 --> 01:25:20,401
[SPEAKER_15]: We drove her nuts and we found her drunk buddy one day in class and that was all the evidence we needed.

1260
01:25:20,801 --> 01:25:22,062
[SPEAKER_18]: I bet you make your mother proud.

1261
01:25:22,082 --> 01:25:25,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, my mom was there saying it's about time you did something good.

1262
01:25:27,979 --> 01:25:31,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm one of those chips over there that are on the floor.

1263
01:25:31,982 --> 01:25:35,464
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyone else have any, like, mess with the teacher stories they want to share?

1264
01:25:36,685 --> 01:25:37,045
[SPEAKER_18]: Blink blink.

1265
01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:43,489
[SPEAKER_06]: I just remember when my teacher would take away, like, something I was drawing on in class, and then I went up to his desk and took it right and then left the classroom.

1266
01:25:43,509 --> 01:25:45,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, you stole from me, this is my property.

1267
01:25:45,951 --> 01:25:51,355
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, um, I, this isn't messing with the teacher, but this is messing with another student.

1268
01:25:51,795 --> 01:26:07,165
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, this one, I don't know what, what, you know, uh, prompted me to do this, but some girl in fourth grade that I used to talk to, uh, I would only talk, only her, no one else, I'd talk to her with a fake Spanish accent, and then at the very last day of the year, I'd talk normal, and she's like, what happened to your voice?

1269
01:26:07,665 --> 01:26:09,406
[SPEAKER_17]: What are you talking about?

1270
01:26:09,446 --> 01:26:11,548
[SPEAKER_17]: It was hilarious.

1271
01:26:11,568 --> 01:26:12,768
[SPEAKER_17]: That's so stupid.

1272
01:26:16,687 --> 01:26:18,569
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, tell us about your MC Hammer pants.

1273
01:26:19,410 --> 01:26:19,891
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah.

1274
01:26:20,191 --> 01:26:21,533
[SPEAKER_17]: You were telling me about this yesterday.

1275
01:26:22,034 --> 01:26:26,259
[SPEAKER_17]: Back in, like, 6th grade when I was, like... It wasn't even... I think it was 6th grade.

1276
01:26:26,279 --> 01:26:27,320
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't remember.

1277
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:29,423
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways, it was, like, after they had built this one in school.

1278
01:26:29,443 --> 01:26:30,685
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember I used to wear these stupid things.

1279
01:26:30,705 --> 01:26:31,506
[SPEAKER_17]: They're, like, these bright...

1280
01:26:31,986 --> 01:26:37,952
[SPEAKER_17]: Neon, like, god-awful, I don't even know what was on them, just, like, these pants things.

1281
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:48,822
[SPEAKER_17]: They were almost like empty hammer pants, but his were, like, kind of, like, silk, so they weren't, like, silk or anything, but I used to wear those all the time and think they were, like, the coolest thing, and I used to be awesome at German dodgeball.

1282
01:26:48,842 --> 01:26:53,826
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just like, yeah, look at me in my pants!

1283
01:26:54,847 --> 01:26:55,147
[SPEAKER_17]: So...

1284
01:26:56,386 --> 01:27:01,130
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember in 11th grade, I took advanced English.

1285
01:27:03,232 --> 01:27:09,597
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would sleep all day in my classes and my teacher wouldn't care because I would always pass my tests and I never read the book.

1286
01:27:11,798 --> 01:27:16,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I just happened to retain everything that she said in class while I was asleep.

1287
01:27:16,923 --> 01:27:20,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Proof that those subliminal learning tapes might actually have worked.

1288
01:27:22,176 --> 01:27:23,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, I could learn in my sleep.

1289
01:27:24,097 --> 01:27:25,298
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, high school is a joke.

1290
01:27:26,099 --> 01:27:33,724
[SPEAKER_15]: In Spanish class, when we'd watch a movie, we'd steal the test for the next two or three months, and we stole midterm and sold it at the beginning of the year.

1291
01:27:34,748 --> 01:27:52,416
[SPEAKER_06]: In chemistry class, I took the later afternoon chemistry class, and we would go whenever we had substitute teachers and were left busy work to do, you know, just those forms to fill out, we would go into the assignment box, because we would have to, we had this little stack of inboxes that we would put in our papers.

1292
01:27:53,076 --> 01:28:03,001
[SPEAKER_06]: We would take the early morning classes papers, and take the person who we know always got the answer right, and copy off the answers on there, turn them back in, spend the rest of the day playing Game Boy in class.

1293
01:28:04,853 --> 01:28:05,794
[SPEAKER_06]: I kid you not, I've done it.

1294
01:28:08,477 --> 01:28:23,231
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I can remember from high school that was funny was one time, this is a very short story, I was in class, I was in ROTC in high school, and my best friend Becky, she gave me, she was like, come here Anita, come here, come here, let me show you something.

1295
01:28:24,052 --> 01:28:25,554
[SPEAKER_03]: She had a Playgirl magazine.

1296
01:28:26,294 --> 01:28:28,436
[SPEAKER_03]: www.DarkSakura.com

1297
01:28:48,977 --> 01:28:52,220
[SPEAKER_03]: and here I am with a Playgirl magazine in ROTC class.

1298
01:28:53,462 --> 01:28:56,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, luckily, our teacher... What grade was this again?

1299
01:28:56,885 --> 01:28:58,807
[SPEAKER_03]: This was like, I was a sophomore in high school.

1300
01:28:59,447 --> 01:29:00,889
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna tell him!

1301
01:29:01,009 --> 01:29:03,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, that bitch should have fucking gotten slapped aside and...

1302
01:29:04,653 --> 01:29:10,359
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to tell because I'm a teacher's pet and I want to be a teacher's best friend.

1303
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:13,583
[SPEAKER_03]: And if she would ask me, I would sleep with her.

1304
01:29:15,185 --> 01:29:19,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it was quite like that, but she was just acting up.

1305
01:29:20,205 --> 01:29:23,628
[SPEAKER_03]: If she bent over to kiss my ass, I would be so there.

1306
01:29:25,469 --> 01:29:27,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyway, what happened was nothing.

1307
01:29:28,111 --> 01:29:28,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get caught.

1308
01:29:29,652 --> 01:29:38,279
[SPEAKER_03]: The teacher came close to check what was going on, but he looked, and I think he realized what was going on, and he was like, I don't want to go there, and he just walked away.

1309
01:29:38,359 --> 01:29:42,021
[SPEAKER_17]: He walked up to the girl who was gone.

1310
01:29:43,543 --> 01:29:45,064
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to read comic books on geometry.

1311
01:29:46,863 --> 01:29:47,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Comic books and geometry?

1312
01:29:48,203 --> 01:29:50,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh, I have a story about geometry class.

1313
01:29:50,824 --> 01:29:55,005
[SPEAKER_06]: My geometry teacher, and I have a picture of him actually with me, not here with me.

1314
01:29:55,065 --> 01:29:55,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, yes, they're in the car.

1315
01:29:55,925 --> 01:29:57,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't find them.

1316
01:29:57,185 --> 01:30:00,606
[SPEAKER_06]: My teacher looked like a treasure troll with no hair.

1317
01:30:03,466 --> 01:30:04,806
[SPEAKER_06]: What color was the hair?

1318
01:30:04,906 --> 01:30:05,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no hair.

1319
01:30:06,207 --> 01:30:07,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he had, you know, he was bald on top.

1320
01:30:08,327 --> 01:30:09,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, how do you look like a treasure troll?

1321
01:30:09,787 --> 01:30:10,987
[SPEAKER_06]: He had the face of a treasure troll.

1322
01:30:11,908 --> 01:30:12,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Same shape.

1323
01:30:12,448 --> 01:30:13,748
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other classes called him Jolly.

1324
01:30:14,511 --> 01:30:14,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Jolly?

1325
01:30:15,211 --> 01:30:16,252
[SPEAKER_06]: No, his name was Mr. Jolly.

1326
01:30:16,592 --> 01:30:18,593
[SPEAKER_06]: The other classes either called him Jolly or they called him Elmer.

1327
01:30:19,354 --> 01:30:19,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoa.

1328
01:30:19,934 --> 01:30:20,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Elmer Fudd.

1329
01:30:21,975 --> 01:30:24,117
[SPEAKER_06]: That was when they're one butt ugly man.

1330
01:30:25,678 --> 01:30:26,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1331
01:30:26,858 --> 01:30:28,959
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would just read comic books because I didn't care.

1332
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:30,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1333
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:33,202
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there was the one time in class where to confuse him.

1334
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:36,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked him, can you truly square infinity?

1335
01:30:36,425 --> 01:30:45,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Because any number, the only numbers that you can multiply, you've said this yourself, it's a proven mathematical fact, that the only numbers that you can square and have them equal themselves are 1 and 0.

1336
01:30:47,509 --> 01:30:47,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

1337
01:30:48,309 --> 01:30:48,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1338
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:56,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you can't square infinity because if the only two things that can equal themselves are zero and one, infinity squared cannot equal infinity.

1339
01:30:57,972 --> 01:31:03,813
[SPEAKER_14]: That just disproves that, though, because infinity... Infinity's not even a number, though, so I guess that doesn't disprove infinity.

1340
01:31:03,893 --> 01:31:04,474
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a number.

1341
01:31:05,754 --> 01:31:06,294
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an idea.

1342
01:31:06,614 --> 01:31:06,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1343
01:31:07,234 --> 01:31:10,815
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was using it in mathematical terms, and he was like, oh, of course you can.

1344
01:31:10,855 --> 01:31:13,116
[SPEAKER_06]: You can square anything that has any type of...

1345
01:31:18,972 --> 01:31:22,835
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically I've managed to disprove him during the middle of his class and make him look like a big idiot.

1346
01:31:23,235 --> 01:31:24,977
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel like I'm in school right now.

1347
01:31:25,377 --> 01:31:25,957
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we stop?

1348
01:31:28,319 --> 01:31:29,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we can stop.

1349
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:30,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a little brat.

1350
01:31:30,341 --> 01:31:31,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, no more school.

1351
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:41,843
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to take a quick break, then we're going to come back, and I think we want to do our list list when we come back from the break?

1352
01:31:41,863 --> 01:31:42,084
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

1353
01:31:42,184 --> 01:31:43,805
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, tonight's list list.

1354
01:31:44,486 --> 01:31:46,007
[SPEAKER_18]: So, who wants to participate tonight?

1355
01:31:46,627 --> 01:31:47,508
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, oh, everybody?

1356
01:31:47,988 --> 01:31:48,249
[SPEAKER_18]: Six?

1357
01:31:48,429 --> 01:31:48,909
[SPEAKER_18]: We could do it.

1358
01:31:49,450 --> 01:31:51,231
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, but this is the interesting thing.

1359
01:31:51,291 --> 01:31:52,172
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, the list tonight.

1360
01:31:52,532 --> 01:31:55,755
[SPEAKER_18]: Top three things that Konami needs to apologize for.

1361
01:31:57,736 --> 01:32:02,300
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so think about that during the break, and we'll be back.

1362
01:32:03,921 --> 01:32:04,301
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1363
01:33:45,706 --> 01:33:46,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching!

1364
01:37:08,357 --> 01:37:10,081
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a long way to go, honey.

1365
01:37:11,203 --> 01:37:11,563
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

1366
01:37:12,605 --> 01:37:13,247
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm afraid.

1367
01:37:13,287 --> 01:37:16,132
[SPEAKER_12]: How are we going?

1368
01:37:16,192 --> 01:37:18,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Into the dark, black forest.

1369
01:38:34,253 --> 01:38:36,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Into the Dark Black Forest.

1370
01:38:45,005 --> 01:38:48,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

1371
01:38:48,809 --> 01:38:50,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1372
01:38:52,830 --> 01:38:56,515
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, we're back and we've got our list list.

1373
01:38:56,555 --> 01:39:00,640
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, tonight's topic is top three things that Konami needs to apologize for.

1374
01:39:01,281 --> 01:39:01,541
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1375
01:39:02,863 --> 01:39:03,964
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, but is everybody done?

1376
01:39:04,525 --> 01:39:05,226
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody did finish?

1377
01:39:05,326 --> 01:39:05,827
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, great.

1378
01:39:07,406 --> 01:39:08,847
[SPEAKER_18]: I would find another reason.

1379
01:39:28,542 --> 01:39:29,862
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a few things they could fix.

1380
01:39:29,983 --> 01:39:31,724
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not for Parapara Paradise.

1381
01:39:33,605 --> 01:39:34,806
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, go for it, Jamie.

1382
01:39:34,846 --> 01:39:37,588
[SPEAKER_18]: You wanted to start... Oh, let me... I'm sorry, I have to bring up the list.

1383
01:39:37,868 --> 01:39:41,111
[SPEAKER_18]: My Word document where I can actually make lists here.

1384
01:39:42,211 --> 01:39:44,213
[SPEAKER_18]: And notice how I've never erased that erotic one.

1385
01:39:44,353 --> 01:39:45,354
[SPEAKER_18]: That was the greatest one we ever did.

1386
01:39:45,814 --> 01:39:47,175
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, Jamie, your number three pick.

1387
01:39:47,995 --> 01:39:50,797
[SPEAKER_06]: They have not done any more Super Konami World games.

1388
01:39:52,619 --> 01:39:56,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Konami World... They had done two of them on the Nintendo...

1389
01:39:58,084 --> 01:40:06,948
[SPEAKER_06]: and you could play as boy or girl and go to the Castlevania universe and then go to the Gradius universe and then it's like a bunch of Konami games in one and it was neat.

1390
01:40:07,488 --> 01:40:08,869
[SPEAKER_06]: And they haven't done any since.

1391
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:12,051
[SPEAKER_06]: We need more Super Konami World.

1392
01:40:12,671 --> 01:40:14,312
[SPEAKER_18]: No new Super Konami World games.

1393
01:40:14,392 --> 01:40:15,332
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie's number three pick.

1394
01:40:15,692 --> 01:40:16,072
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki.

1395
01:40:20,634 --> 01:40:22,976
[SPEAKER_17]: They should apologize for...

1396
01:40:28,168 --> 01:40:30,369
[SPEAKER_18]: They should apologize for DDRPC.

1397
01:40:31,570 --> 01:40:32,210
[SPEAKER_18]: And why is that?

1398
01:40:33,091 --> 01:40:34,491
[SPEAKER_17]: The game sucks ass.

1399
01:40:35,072 --> 01:40:36,012
[SPEAKER_18]: The game sucks ass.

1400
01:40:36,052 --> 01:40:36,372
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1401
01:40:38,013 --> 01:40:40,795
[SPEAKER_18]: Zero, what should Konami apologize for?

1402
01:40:41,715 --> 01:40:46,418
[SPEAKER_15]: One I just put basically was shitty steps for hella good songs on Xtreme.

1403
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:49,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, sync steps suck.

1404
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,201
[SPEAKER_15]: Frozen Ray sucks.

1405
01:40:52,256 --> 01:40:53,197
[SPEAKER_15]: V sucks.

1406
01:40:54,078 --> 01:40:55,739
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, the list could just go on.

1407
01:40:55,839 --> 01:40:56,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Colors sucks.

1408
01:40:58,141 --> 01:41:00,843
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, do I even need to say more about that?

1409
01:41:01,483 --> 01:41:03,625
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, shitty steps for good songs on Xtreme.

1410
01:41:03,885 --> 01:41:05,146
[SPEAKER_18]: Anita, your number three pick.

1411
01:41:06,968 --> 01:41:10,070
[SPEAKER_03]: My number three, I think they should apologize.

1412
01:41:11,011 --> 01:41:12,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine are weak, but here we go.

1413
01:41:12,652 --> 01:41:14,734
[SPEAKER_03]: For not making DDRUSA better.

1414
01:41:20,012 --> 01:41:22,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, I'm actually talking about the arcade game.

1415
01:41:22,973 --> 01:41:26,715
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, okay, so the arcade, I'll specify that, not making DDR USA arcade better.

1416
01:41:26,895 --> 01:41:30,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1417
01:41:31,698 --> 01:41:39,962
[SPEAKER_03]: They should have had, I think it sucked that they didn't have any Korean songs on there, because that was what made, yeah, well, I know.

1418
01:41:40,302 --> 01:41:44,464
[SPEAKER_03]: That made, like, the first, second, and third mixes the best, though, I thought.

1419
01:41:46,528 --> 01:41:48,590
[SPEAKER_18]: Ice Queen Ah, for discontinuing keyboard mania.

1420
01:42:10,740 --> 01:42:12,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I'm typing.

1421
01:42:12,621 --> 01:42:16,823
[SPEAKER_18]: When there's dead air, it's up to the person who said something to elaborate on what they said.

1422
01:42:17,343 --> 01:42:17,603
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1423
01:42:17,944 --> 01:42:20,665
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I don't get the list in advance.

1424
01:42:20,725 --> 01:42:21,105
[SPEAKER_18]: My turn.

1425
01:42:21,145 --> 01:42:23,466
[SPEAKER_18]: The number three thing they should apologize for.

1426
01:42:23,787 --> 01:42:26,028
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I actually had DDRPC on my list.

1427
01:42:26,228 --> 01:42:31,510
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm going to say the number three thing that Konami should apologize for.

1428
01:42:31,971 --> 01:42:36,273
[SPEAKER_18]: And I apologize in advance to some folks in our chat room because they're really going to hate me for saying this.

1429
01:42:36,633 --> 01:42:38,454
[SPEAKER_18]: But they need to apologize for the whistle song.

1430
01:42:39,696 --> 01:42:41,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that song fucking sucks.

1431
01:42:41,698 --> 01:42:50,024
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know there's fans of it in the chat room, but you need to understand, I had no problem with the song until other people ruined it for me.

1432
01:42:51,024 --> 01:42:54,047
[SPEAKER_18]: By just, by like chanting along to it and all that stuff.

1433
01:42:55,328 --> 01:42:59,791
[SPEAKER_18]: It's now ruined, and now it needs to be apologized for, so, alright.

1434
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:02,353
[SPEAKER_06]: That song just sucks anyway.

1435
01:43:02,373 --> 01:43:08,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, my number two pick is they should apologize for the bad voice acting in Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

1436
01:43:12,119 --> 01:43:16,821
[SPEAKER_06]: That game had atrocious voice acting in comparison to the Japanese version.

1437
01:43:18,181 --> 01:43:21,322
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not by my hand that I was once again given flesh.

1438
01:43:22,923 --> 01:43:23,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Die, monster!

1439
01:43:24,163 --> 01:43:25,603
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't belong in this world!

1440
01:43:26,484 --> 01:43:29,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, well die, Richter voice actor, you don't belong in this game!

1441
01:43:29,465 --> 01:43:29,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha ha!

1442
01:43:31,235 --> 01:43:31,555
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1443
01:43:32,336 --> 01:43:33,457
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, your number two pick.

1444
01:43:34,618 --> 01:43:36,079
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, let's see.

1445
01:43:36,379 --> 01:43:39,442
[SPEAKER_17]: I would have to say they need to apologize.

1446
01:43:40,663 --> 01:43:44,286
[SPEAKER_17]: This should almost be a number one, but they need to apologize for B4U.

1447
01:43:45,707 --> 01:43:48,209
[SPEAKER_17]: I hate the group B4U.

1448
01:43:48,229 --> 01:43:49,390
[SPEAKER_17]: They can all die.

1449
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:50,251
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay?

1450
01:43:51,031 --> 01:43:51,532
[SPEAKER_18]: All of them.

1451
01:43:54,094 --> 01:43:55,555
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie had that written as her number one.

1452
01:43:55,615 --> 01:43:56,255
[SPEAKER_18]: Now she's thinking.

1453
01:43:57,677 --> 01:43:57,997
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1454
01:44:01,156 --> 01:44:02,978
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, your number two pick, Zero.

1455
01:44:03,639 --> 01:44:06,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, basically fucking over the US.

1456
01:44:06,263 --> 01:44:12,732
[SPEAKER_15]: When it comes to any DDR releases, or pretty much any B-Mani release, we get, like, the total shit end of the stick.

1457
01:44:13,422 --> 01:44:21,127
[SPEAKER_15]: We got, like, what, four mi- like, three mixes of DDR, because I'm not even counting that horrible-ass Disney's mix or whatever.

1458
01:44:22,408 --> 01:44:25,249
[SPEAKER_15]: The Japanese one was good, but the US one was totally just raped.

1459
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:31,473
[SPEAKER_15]: It was... Yeah, Dance Magic was a cool thing, but, like, the game itself sucked.

1460
01:44:31,914 --> 01:44:32,374
[SPEAKER_15]: All the other...

1461
01:44:33,203 --> 01:44:33,343
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1462
01:44:52,461 --> 01:44:53,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I guess it's my turn.

1463
01:44:53,462 --> 01:44:53,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1464
01:44:55,303 --> 01:44:56,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, where am I here?

1465
01:44:57,164 --> 01:45:01,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I think we should apologize for not making more mixes of Para Para Paradise.

1466
01:45:02,527 --> 01:45:03,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcade game.

1467
01:45:07,150 --> 01:45:11,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know Para Para Para itself kind of died in Japan, but shoot.

1468
01:45:12,353 --> 01:45:14,655
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's one game.

1469
01:45:15,115 --> 01:45:15,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

1470
01:45:16,736 --> 01:45:17,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, was it?

1471
01:45:17,597 --> 01:45:17,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1472
01:45:19,824 --> 01:45:20,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it going to be a cure?

1473
01:45:20,645 --> 01:45:22,847
[SPEAKER_03]: The Parapara craze is actually starting to pick up here.

1474
01:45:22,867 --> 01:45:23,828
[SPEAKER_06]: A few places.

1475
01:45:24,148 --> 01:45:26,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Like in the dance clubs kind of thing?

1476
01:45:27,531 --> 01:45:30,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they've had Parapara All-Stars touring the U.S.

1477
01:45:31,574 --> 01:45:32,255
[SPEAKER_06]: You're kidding me.

1478
01:45:32,415 --> 01:45:37,600
[SPEAKER_06]: At Anime Expo, they had them giving out flyers and doing instructions at Anime Expo last year.

1479
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:38,721
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fly!

1480
01:45:40,202 --> 01:45:40,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1481
01:45:41,063 --> 01:45:43,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't go to Anime Expo, by the way, because it's the worst convention ever.

1482
01:45:43,645 --> 01:45:44,105
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

1483
01:45:48,536 --> 01:45:50,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, more para para, please.

1484
01:45:51,298 --> 01:45:53,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I'll pass the microphone.

1485
01:45:53,919 --> 01:45:54,279
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1486
01:45:55,340 --> 01:46:02,124
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Konami really needs to apologize, and this is kind of an addition to Zero's earlier statement.

1487
01:46:02,985 --> 01:46:06,567
[SPEAKER_14]: They need to apologize for Konami USA, period.

1488
01:46:08,888 --> 01:46:10,249
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm elaborating on his.

1489
01:46:10,269 --> 01:46:11,209
[SPEAKER_14]: That was my original idea.

1490
01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:13,471
[SPEAKER_14]: Konami America is just...

1491
01:46:14,435 --> 01:46:16,717
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, it is just not limited to Banbani.

1492
01:46:17,538 --> 01:46:24,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything that they made in Japan that has been transferred over to the US through Konami USA sucks.

1493
01:46:25,266 --> 01:46:27,028
[SPEAKER_14]: They raped it up the ass and started punching it.

1494
01:46:27,068 --> 01:46:28,089
[SPEAKER_14]: What is that, donkey punching?

1495
01:46:28,609 --> 01:46:28,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1496
01:46:29,891 --> 01:46:31,452
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, I'm sorry, but that's just it.

1497
01:46:34,075 --> 01:46:34,435
[SPEAKER_14]: Period.

1498
01:46:35,316 --> 01:46:35,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Next.

1499
01:46:37,165 --> 01:46:46,308
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, my number two pick that Konami needs to apologize, excuse me, things that Konami needs to apologize for, I would say Castlevania 64.

1500
01:46:46,648 --> 01:46:46,988
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1501
01:46:48,789 --> 01:46:55,871
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I know, but I actually had it on my list before it was said in the chat room, but whatever.

1502
01:46:56,271 --> 01:47:02,333
[SPEAKER_06]: When I first started playing that game, I thought it was, it almost started off as a good game, and then like halfway through the first level, I was like, eh.

1503
01:47:04,013 --> 01:47:06,134
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, now our number one picks.

1504
01:47:08,062 --> 01:47:15,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, they need to apologize for the Super Nintendo version of Dracula X. Because I have the PC Engine version.

1505
01:47:16,126 --> 01:47:16,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

1506
01:47:17,407 --> 01:47:34,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Where I actually really like the Super Nintendo one, if ever you've played the, um, the, uh, PC Engine version, then that's like, where the PC Engine version is like eating a feast, the, um, SNES version is like vomit.

1507
01:47:36,336 --> 01:47:37,077
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

1508
01:47:38,095 --> 01:47:41,436
[SPEAKER_18]: So, Dracula 5 gets, uh... 5?

1509
01:47:41,556 --> 01:47:42,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that what they called it here?

1510
01:47:42,476 --> 01:47:43,617
[SPEAKER_18]: Isn't that what they called it here?

1511
01:47:43,637 --> 01:47:45,297
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was Dracula X on Super Nintendo.

1512
01:47:45,357 --> 01:47:46,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I thought they called it Dracula 5.

1513
01:47:47,158 --> 01:47:48,418
[SPEAKER_18]: Or Castlevania 5 or something.

1514
01:47:48,458 --> 01:47:49,418
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's Dracula X. Oh, okay.

1515
01:47:49,478 --> 01:47:49,858
[SPEAKER_18]: My bad.

1516
01:47:50,278 --> 01:47:50,638
[SPEAKER_18]: My bad.

1517
01:47:50,719 --> 01:47:53,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Which was actually cool, because, you know, actually Symphony of the Night was Dracula X, too.

1518
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:56,260
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1519
01:47:57,580 --> 01:47:58,761
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you're Loki, I'm sorry.

1520
01:47:59,321 --> 01:48:00,501
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki's number one pick.

1521
01:48:02,802 --> 01:48:03,322
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1522
01:48:04,982 --> 01:48:06,543
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, they need to apologize.

1523
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,040
[SPEAKER_17]: for Politary.

1524
01:48:11,901 --> 01:48:29,426
[SPEAKER_17]: Because, you know what, she wouldn't have a career if it weren't for DDR, and I would hope that she wouldn't have a career if it weren't for DDR, and I wish she would just go, you know what, we were hoping that you would get better, you never did, so bye.

1525
01:48:31,387 --> 01:48:32,687
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, Zero, your number one pick.

1526
01:48:33,464 --> 01:48:38,627
[SPEAKER_15]: My number one pick is for Naoki and all of his 150 other aliases.

1527
01:48:39,348 --> 01:48:45,832
[SPEAKER_15]: Because every, I would say about 95% of every song he put on DDR sucks ass.

1528
01:48:46,633 --> 01:48:48,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Doesn't matter what it is, it sucks.

1529
01:48:48,414 --> 01:48:51,096
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, how many B4Us and Brilliant 2Us do we need?

1530
01:48:51,136 --> 01:48:54,378
[SPEAKER_15]: How many Paranoias and whatever else comes up do we need?

1531
01:48:55,258 --> 01:48:57,440
[SPEAKER_15]: So, that would be a good FU also.

1532
01:48:59,941 --> 01:49:00,242
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1533
01:49:01,923 --> 01:49:02,223
[SPEAKER_18]: Anita.

1534
01:49:03,959 --> 01:49:04,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question, Zero.

1535
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:08,263
[SPEAKER_03]: How come you named your cat Naoki then?

1536
01:49:10,624 --> 01:49:13,547
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I was actually drunk when I named my cat.

1537
01:49:13,807 --> 01:49:16,449
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just got too lazy to try to think of something else.

1538
01:49:16,729 --> 01:49:19,291
[SPEAKER_15]: And my cat makes the name Naoki sound cool.

1539
01:49:21,033 --> 01:49:23,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, your cat was also answering to Naochan, too.

1540
01:49:27,818 --> 01:49:28,519
[SPEAKER_18]: Anita, you're number one.

1541
01:49:28,539 --> 01:49:29,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my number one.

1542
01:49:30,487 --> 01:49:34,529
[SPEAKER_03]: They should apologize for Let Them Move!

1543
01:49:36,330 --> 01:49:37,250
[SPEAKER_18]: Excellent suggestion.

1544
01:49:40,551 --> 01:49:42,332
[SPEAKER_18]: Matt, or Ice Queen, your number one pick.

1545
01:49:42,872 --> 01:49:43,873
[SPEAKER_14]: They need to apologize.

1546
01:49:46,161 --> 01:49:47,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yes, yes.

1547
01:49:48,383 --> 01:49:49,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that your answer, or what do you want to say?

1548
01:49:49,583 --> 01:49:52,545
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what, I had something in mind, but I'm going to change it to Loki's.

1549
01:49:53,226 --> 01:49:54,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Bag.

1550
01:49:54,446 --> 01:49:54,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Period.

1551
01:49:56,087 --> 01:50:00,410
[SPEAKER_14]: Who wants to hear a freaking bat pipe screeching as loud as you can get it?

1552
01:50:00,931 --> 01:50:01,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, Jamie.

1553
01:50:03,192 --> 01:50:03,792
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god.

1554
01:50:04,113 --> 01:50:04,793
[SPEAKER_14]: No comment.

1555
01:50:06,294 --> 01:50:07,695
[SPEAKER_14]: They really need to apologize for that.

1556
01:50:09,068 --> 01:50:11,229
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, very controversial topic in the chat room.

1557
01:50:11,249 --> 01:50:12,810
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a lot of people arguing with this.

1558
01:50:12,870 --> 01:50:13,650
[SPEAKER_18]: This is interesting.

1559
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:17,452
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, but my number one, and I'm surprised nobody said this yet.

1560
01:50:18,572 --> 01:50:22,334
[SPEAKER_18]: My thing that needs to apologize for, their new logo.

1561
01:50:24,675 --> 01:50:25,576
[SPEAKER_18]: What the hell is that?

1562
01:50:27,436 --> 01:50:28,537
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not even retro.

1563
01:50:29,758 --> 01:50:30,878
[SPEAKER_18]: It's retro my butt.

1564
01:50:30,998 --> 01:50:34,740
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, you want to read this big huge list before we do eliminations?

1565
01:50:35,333 --> 01:51:00,766
[SPEAKER_06]: No New Super Konami World Games, DDRPC, Shitty Steps for Good Songs on Xtreme, Not Making DDRUSA Arcade Better, Discontinuing Keyboard Mania, The Whistle Song, Bad Voice Acting, Castlevania XIX, B4U, Clicking Over the US, No New Parapara Games, KonamiUSA, Castlevania 64, SNES version of Dracula X, Politary, Now Keen as 150 Aliases, Let Them Move, Vag, and New Logo.

1566
01:51:01,346 --> 01:51:02,867
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, elimination time.

1567
01:51:03,007 --> 01:51:04,929
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie, what comes off the list?

1568
01:51:05,069 --> 01:51:06,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably Naoki.

1569
01:51:06,690 --> 01:51:07,431
[SPEAKER_18]: Naoki and his 150 aliases?

1570
01:51:07,451 --> 01:51:08,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Because...

1571
01:51:10,195 --> 01:51:14,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Before I had heard many TAC things, I really liked Naoki's mixes.

1572
01:51:15,879 --> 01:51:16,719
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd actually kind of agree.

1573
01:51:16,739 --> 01:51:20,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, I was a big fan of Brilliant to You, OG.

1574
01:51:20,342 --> 01:51:22,443
[SPEAKER_06]: That was like my favorite song ever.

1575
01:51:22,743 --> 01:51:34,472
[SPEAKER_18]: I would agree to some extent because some of the Naoki aliases are bad, like Naoki featuring Paula Terry, and Naoki, or what is it, NMR, like Let Them Move and stuff, those are bad.

1576
01:51:34,492 --> 01:51:37,194
[SPEAKER_18]: But like Naoki Underground, who did Insertion, that's pretty cool, so...

1577
01:51:37,994 --> 01:51:39,996
[SPEAKER_18]: Although I do agree he needs to get over the identity crisis.

1578
01:51:40,157 --> 01:51:42,939
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1579
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:44,421
[SPEAKER_18]: Next, yeah, Loki, what are you taking off?

1580
01:51:45,062 --> 01:51:50,607
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to take off not making DDR USA Arcade better, because you know what?

1581
01:51:50,727 --> 01:51:51,628
[SPEAKER_17]: I just don't care.

1582
01:51:51,648 --> 01:51:54,831
[SPEAKER_17]: That machine doesn't exist to me anymore, so whatever.

1583
01:51:58,777 --> 01:52:00,658
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost took off that one for one reason.

1584
01:52:01,238 --> 01:52:03,980
[SPEAKER_06]: It sort of opened the door for all the new stuff we're getting now.

1585
01:52:08,683 --> 01:52:10,464
[SPEAKER_18]: It's red and has Konami on it.

1586
01:52:10,664 --> 01:52:11,284
[SPEAKER_18]: It's ugly.

1587
01:52:11,905 --> 01:52:14,766
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, Zero, what's coming off the list?

1588
01:52:14,906 --> 01:52:18,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Even though I totally agree, I would say let them move.

1589
01:52:18,568 --> 01:52:19,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Take that off.

1590
01:52:19,729 --> 01:52:23,691
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I absolutely agree with it because it's horrible, but the other ones are better.

1591
01:52:27,602 --> 01:52:28,362
[SPEAKER_15]: The Song Sucks

1592
01:52:48,957 --> 01:52:52,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'll just say shitty steps for a good song setting stream.

1593
01:52:53,646 --> 01:52:54,147
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1594
01:52:56,592 --> 01:52:58,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, exactly, that is the reason.

1595
01:52:58,516 --> 01:52:59,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I am attacking zero.

1596
01:53:02,535 --> 01:53:11,339
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I just think you have a very good point, but it just doesn't seem like as much of a bitch as the rest of the stuff.

1597
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:12,700
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1598
01:53:13,961 --> 01:53:14,861
[SPEAKER_18]: Decisions final.

1599
01:53:14,901 --> 01:53:16,062
[SPEAKER_18]: Matt, what comes off the list?

1600
01:53:16,442 --> 01:53:20,784
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll have to take off the new logo just because, you know, there's so many other things on there that are so much better.

1601
01:53:21,645 --> 01:53:23,806
[SPEAKER_14]: It sucks, but let's review.

1602
01:53:25,201 --> 01:53:30,525
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, I'm gonna get slapped for this, but it's so bad that it's good.

1603
01:53:31,046 --> 01:53:34,248
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm taking off the bad voice acting in Castlevania VI Day and Night.

1604
01:53:35,509 --> 01:53:41,213
[SPEAKER_18]: Because, you know what, I, I, it's, it's one of those things where it's like, I love mimicking it.

1605
01:53:41,633 --> 01:53:42,634
[SPEAKER_18]: Die, monster!

1606
01:53:42,974 --> 01:53:44,335
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't belong in this world!

1607
01:53:44,395 --> 01:53:48,757
[SPEAKER_18]: And I mean, it's so bad that I love to mimic it, so for that it's redeemable.

1608
01:53:49,137 --> 01:53:50,118
[SPEAKER_06]: True of all religions!

1609
01:53:51,839 --> 01:53:54,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan and I used to quote that game.

1610
01:53:55,381 --> 01:53:55,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1611
01:53:56,707 --> 01:54:04,212
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm not doing that because Brad is jumping in the chatroom up and down asking me to, but I really do think that it's so bad it's good.

1612
01:54:04,912 --> 01:54:08,495
[SPEAKER_18]: So, there you go.

1613
01:54:08,635 --> 01:54:13,178
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, so, wait, I have to close out all the windows first before I can start taking votes here.

1614
01:54:15,779 --> 01:54:21,923
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody had suggested, because of no new remixes by the T-Word, what were some other suggestions?

1615
01:54:21,963 --> 01:54:22,684
[SPEAKER_18]: I missed them, oh well.

1616
01:54:23,353 --> 01:54:26,669
[SPEAKER_04]: I find it funny that he's been reduced to a four letter word.

1617
01:54:28,777 --> 01:54:35,299
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we're going to post that list and you guys can send in your votes right now over private message to Sky.

1618
01:54:35,659 --> 01:54:36,839
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie, you want to read the final list?

1619
01:54:37,239 --> 01:54:51,562
[SPEAKER_06]: No new Super Konami World games, DDRPC, Discontinuing Keyboard Mania, The Whistle Song, B4U, Fucking Over the US, no new Parapari games, Konami USA, Castlevania 64, the SNES version of Dracula X, Politary, and Bag.

1620
01:54:52,283 --> 01:54:53,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Vote now or die!

1621
01:54:55,743 --> 01:55:02,965
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, so vote now and send those votes to Sky in the chat room.

1622
01:55:03,165 --> 01:55:03,845
[SPEAKER_06]: You should play bag.

1623
01:55:04,566 --> 01:55:05,406
[SPEAKER_18]: You want me to play bag?

1624
01:55:08,127 --> 01:55:08,407
[SPEAKER_18]: No!

1625
01:55:08,427 --> 01:55:10,527
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what, I can't do it because I'll lose half the listeners.

1626
01:55:10,567 --> 01:55:10,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Play Orion.

1627
01:55:11,327 --> 01:55:11,828
[SPEAKER_18]: Play Orion?

1628
01:55:11,848 --> 01:55:12,808
[SPEAKER_18]: That's almost just as bad.

1629
01:55:13,088 --> 01:55:14,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but it's funny.

1630
01:55:14,928 --> 01:55:16,769
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to go to break and we're going to play Orion.

1631
01:55:16,809 --> 01:55:18,089
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll play another quick song.

1632
01:55:18,489 --> 01:55:21,990
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll try to keep this one a short break because we want to do the cage match tonight at some point too.

1633
01:55:22,491 --> 01:55:23,631
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll probably do that when we come back.

1634
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:31,550
[SPEAKER_18]: So, we will do a quick break.

1635
01:55:32,151 --> 01:55:32,472
[SPEAKER_18]: Which one?

1636
01:55:32,552 --> 01:55:34,034
[SPEAKER_18]: You want the old school one or you want the new one?

1637
01:55:34,235 --> 01:55:34,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Old school one.

1638
01:55:34,916 --> 01:55:35,457
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, old school one.

1639
01:55:35,897 --> 01:55:36,418
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be back.

1640
01:55:36,899 --> 01:55:38,261
[SPEAKER_18]: Send your votes in now, please, please, please.

1641
01:55:53,268 --> 01:55:55,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Achievement Achievement Achievement

1642
01:57:10,062 --> 01:57:16,536
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I apologize because that was mislabeled, so that wasn't the old school one, but I found the right one, so enjoy!

1643
01:57:16,636 --> 01:57:17,198
[SPEAKER_18]: A double shot!

1644
02:00:18,655 --> 02:00:25,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

1645
02:00:26,362 --> 02:00:32,327
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to, and still the fun is just as great.

1646
02:00:32,647 --> 02:00:34,549
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

1647
02:00:35,129 --> 02:00:39,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Kick it with me, and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

1648
02:00:41,343 --> 02:00:42,124
[SPEAKER_18]: Howdy, kids!

1649
02:00:42,424 --> 02:00:51,574
[SPEAKER_18]: We're back, and we're being a little slow because the listless votes aren't fully tallied yet, so we're going to go right into this week's cage match.

1650
02:00:51,775 --> 02:00:53,937
[SPEAKER_18]: Last week... Oh, I've got to get all this stuff queued up, though.

1651
02:00:53,957 --> 02:00:54,438
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not even ready.

1652
02:00:55,954 --> 02:01:00,698
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there anything, uh, wait, wait, but you said you wanted to make a stipulation before this week's cable.

1653
02:01:00,778 --> 02:01:04,081
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you pulling out about what you wanted to do to your song last week?

1654
02:01:04,101 --> 02:01:07,424
[SPEAKER_06]: If I withdrew mine, I'd want to put it in a new one, which means I have to go to my car real quick.

1655
02:01:07,904 --> 02:01:09,505
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, so, oh, you have last week's winner in here.

1656
02:01:09,606 --> 02:01:13,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I put it in there, but I kind of want to withdraw it and put in something new if I can.

1657
02:01:13,729 --> 02:01:14,430
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you guys think?

1658
02:01:15,050 --> 02:01:16,331
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, let's ask the chat room what they think.

1659
02:01:16,351 --> 02:01:18,093
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's hear a little bit of last week's winner.

1660
02:01:19,710 --> 02:01:20,191
[SPEAKER_18]: I hated it.

1661
02:01:20,211 --> 02:01:21,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I picked it because it was hyper.

1662
02:01:21,192 --> 02:01:22,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I'll go to my car.

1663
02:02:12,267 --> 02:02:16,028
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, by an overwhelming vote in the chat room, it's out of here.

1664
02:02:16,508 --> 02:02:17,048
[SPEAKER_18]: It's gone.

1665
02:02:17,328 --> 02:02:18,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I'm going to go get a CD out of the car.

1666
02:02:18,829 --> 02:02:19,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be right back.

1667
02:02:20,336 --> 02:02:20,716
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1668
02:02:23,038 --> 02:02:25,500
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm getting suggestions for what to put in this week, too.

1669
02:02:25,580 --> 02:02:25,960
[SPEAKER_18]: That's great.

1670
02:02:29,162 --> 02:02:32,405
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so we're going to start this week's cage match, except I'm short a few songs.

1671
02:02:32,645 --> 02:02:33,906
[SPEAKER_18]: So, clean slate.

1672
02:02:33,946 --> 02:02:37,748
[SPEAKER_18]: We have no winners coming over from last week, because we're deleting that, because it sucked.

1673
02:02:41,991 --> 02:02:42,852
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know how it won.

1674
02:02:42,892 --> 02:02:46,074
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess the other two songs... I put in Fable, and everybody had something against that song.

1675
02:02:46,094 --> 02:02:47,215
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1676
02:02:48,726 --> 02:02:49,928
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, so I guess I'll start.

1677
02:02:50,528 --> 02:02:55,194
[SPEAKER_18]: Since we're starting with a clean slate tonight, let's refresh everybody on how the cage match works.

1678
02:02:56,075 --> 02:03:00,520
[SPEAKER_18]: We have this little segment that reoccurs on the show called the Orange Lounge Cage Match.

1679
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:06,627
[SPEAKER_18]: The way it works, each of the hosts puts in one song that they want to put in there.

1680
02:03:08,204 --> 02:03:10,367
[SPEAKER_18]: and the chat room votes on which is their favorite.

1681
02:03:10,667 --> 02:03:16,895
[SPEAKER_18]: And the winner gets to go into regular rotation on the station during the Bomani Music and More program.

1682
02:03:17,175 --> 02:03:20,720
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I'm getting votes for stuff.

1683
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:21,721
[SPEAKER_18]: This is interesting.

1684
02:03:21,841 --> 02:03:22,122
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, no.

1685
02:03:22,482 --> 02:03:23,744
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't tell me what to put in.

1686
02:03:26,317 --> 02:03:29,784
[SPEAKER_17]: And like half the ones you're mentioning either suck ass or have already been in there.

1687
02:03:31,687 --> 02:03:33,771
[SPEAKER_18]: No, actually, another song by that artist is in there.

1688
02:03:33,812 --> 02:03:35,996
[SPEAKER_18]: I get what she was saying.

1689
02:03:36,016 --> 02:03:37,960
[SPEAKER_18]: I already have a song for this week, but I'll do that for next week.

1690
02:03:39,432 --> 02:03:41,933
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I'm so tempted to put that song in, Justin.

1691
02:03:42,533 --> 02:03:43,874
[SPEAKER_18]: Or whatever you're called this week, Justin.

1692
02:03:44,634 --> 02:03:48,575
[SPEAKER_18]: I really want to put that first song in there you sent me, but I'm not ready to yet.

1693
02:03:48,615 --> 02:03:49,455
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll do that next week, okay?

1694
02:03:49,475 --> 02:03:50,996
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I really want to do this song this week.

1695
02:03:51,336 --> 02:03:51,956
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'll start.

1696
02:03:52,877 --> 02:03:59,299
[SPEAKER_18]: My song this week that I'm going to do is by a group that you know from 2DX.

1697
02:03:59,399 --> 02:04:02,660
[SPEAKER_18]: They were in 7th Style, and they have a pretty popular song in there.

1698
02:04:04,116 --> 02:04:06,479
[SPEAKER_18]: And the song they did in there was called The Beauty of Silence.

1699
02:04:07,480 --> 02:04:09,122
[SPEAKER_18]: And the group is Svensson and Gleeland.

1700
02:04:09,242 --> 02:04:12,386
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is another song by them.

1701
02:04:12,947 --> 02:04:13,748
[SPEAKER_17]: I have this song.

1702
02:04:13,988 --> 02:04:14,549
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, cool.

1703
02:04:14,589 --> 02:04:16,611
[SPEAKER_18]: This is my pick for tonight's cage match.

1704
02:04:16,972 --> 02:04:21,037
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a song called Twisted by the same group that did Beauty of Silence, Svensson and Gleeland.

1705
02:04:21,117 --> 02:04:21,397
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy.

1706
02:04:34,219 --> 02:04:34,965
Thanks for watching!

1707
02:05:09,241 --> 02:05:10,061
Thanks for watching!

1708
02:05:40,089 --> 02:05:40,631
Thanks for watching!

1709
02:06:19,113 --> 02:06:20,054
Thanks for watching!

1710
02:06:39,611 --> 02:06:41,253
[SPEAKER_18]: That kind of has an abrupt ending, oops.

1711
02:06:41,573 --> 02:06:43,496
[SPEAKER_18]: That's because it came off a non-stop mix.

1712
02:06:43,596 --> 02:06:47,961
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, that was the energy mix of Twisted by Svensson and Ghislain, same group that did Beauty of Silence.

1713
02:06:48,141 --> 02:06:48,882
[SPEAKER_18]: And what did y'all think?

1714
02:06:49,122 --> 02:06:50,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Beauty of Silence, it ain't.

1715
02:06:51,345 --> 02:06:52,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, that was really boring.

1716
02:06:52,726 --> 02:06:54,168
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you give it on 110?

1717
02:06:54,829 --> 02:06:55,730
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, poop on you!

1718
02:06:55,930 --> 02:06:57,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I'd give it a 5.

1719
02:06:57,552 --> 02:06:58,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Right down the middle. 0.

1720
02:07:03,575 --> 02:07:12,658
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of give it, I had like six songs throughout that, I guess I'll give it like 56, because I really like video sounds, and that seemed to have been really well, so it's more real repetitive.

1721
02:07:14,519 --> 02:07:14,859
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki.

1722
02:07:15,819 --> 02:07:20,781
[SPEAKER_17]: I've heard better cuts of that same song, and that was a pretty bad cut of it.

1723
02:07:20,901 --> 02:07:28,903
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I said, it's repetitive, it does kind of, you know, give you something to feel, but the middle is the beginning of my favorite part, and I give it a 4.

1724
02:07:29,263 --> 02:07:30,484
[SPEAKER_14]: Good one, all of you.

1725
02:07:31,633 --> 02:07:41,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Ice Queen I can't really do too much of a judgement as far as cast history on this one goes I do like the song Beauty with the Stylist but this one was like well I'm just going by an overall judgement and I have to give it a bottom 5 because it was kind of repetitive

1726
02:08:00,368 --> 02:08:02,931
[SPEAKER_03]: but I kind of liked it too.

1727
02:08:03,071 --> 02:08:05,393
[SPEAKER_03]: It just sounded kind of nice.

1728
02:08:05,734 --> 02:08:10,378
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, and I personally, I give that a 150, so that way it averages all your votes to a 10.

1729
02:08:10,458 --> 02:08:11,399
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, that's great.

1730
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:12,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob?

1731
02:08:12,540 --> 02:08:12,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?

1732
02:08:13,521 --> 02:08:14,643
[SPEAKER_04]: All your balls need to die.

1733
02:08:14,943 --> 02:08:15,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1734
02:08:15,283 --> 02:08:15,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Love us.

1735
02:08:17,267 --> 02:08:17,587
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what?

1736
02:08:17,607 --> 02:08:18,128
[SPEAKER_18]: Y'all suck.

1737
02:08:18,188 --> 02:08:19,849
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm never going to win this goddamn thing.

1738
02:08:19,930 --> 02:08:20,430
[SPEAKER_18]: I try.

1739
02:08:20,750 --> 02:08:22,272
[SPEAKER_18]: I try a different song.

1740
02:08:23,133 --> 02:08:25,555
[SPEAKER_05]: All you have to do is pick an Ayumi Trans thing and you'll win.

1741
02:08:25,775 --> 02:08:27,697
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to pick another Ayumi Trans thing.

1742
02:08:27,737 --> 02:08:29,458
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to do another Vincent DeMora thing.

1743
02:08:29,499 --> 02:08:29,699
[SPEAKER_18]: Why?

1744
02:08:29,719 --> 02:08:30,479
[SPEAKER_18]: Because that's cheap.

1745
02:08:30,940 --> 02:08:34,503
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to pick something that wins because it's awesome.

1746
02:08:34,523 --> 02:08:34,864
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know what?

1747
02:08:34,884 --> 02:08:35,604
[SPEAKER_18]: That song's awesome.

1748
02:08:36,605 --> 02:08:38,407
[SPEAKER_18]: You all are just, you know what?

1749
02:08:38,747 --> 02:08:39,908
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, you know what JB said?

1750
02:08:39,988 --> 02:08:42,550
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I will do JB's song next week then.

1751
02:08:42,630 --> 02:08:43,331
[SPEAKER_18]: You will see.

1752
02:08:43,871 --> 02:08:44,592
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to come back.

1753
02:08:44,632 --> 02:08:46,273
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to save this clip of the show.

1754
02:08:46,333 --> 02:08:51,718
[SPEAKER_18]: And after I play what he sent me next week, I'm going to remind you all that you asked me to play that, okay?

1755
02:08:52,018 --> 02:08:53,059
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all I have to say.

1756
02:08:53,900 --> 02:08:54,801
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, play mine.

1757
02:08:56,222 --> 02:08:58,164
[SPEAKER_18]: And all your balls need to, yeah.

1758
02:08:58,504 --> 02:08:59,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Good thing I don't have any.

1759
02:08:59,665 --> 02:09:00,966
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, Jamie, what's your pick?

1760
02:09:00,986 --> 02:09:01,527
[SPEAKER_18]: Tell us about it.

1761
02:09:01,727 --> 02:09:03,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Beatbox, What a Wonderful World.

1762
02:09:19,017 --> 02:09:29,331
[SPEAKER_12]: The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky Are all the summer faces, of people calling by I've been praying to shake it down, saying oh

1763
02:09:46,863 --> 02:09:47,164
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi.

1764
02:09:49,794 --> 02:09:50,376
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what happened.

1765
02:09:50,416 --> 02:09:50,617
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.

1766
02:10:08,433 --> 02:10:13,277
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I'm going to abort this real fast because we're going to try switching it around a little bit.

1767
02:10:13,337 --> 02:10:14,858
[SPEAKER_18]: We're having issues with that CD.

1768
02:10:14,898 --> 02:10:16,159
[SPEAKER_06]: I burned this like three days ago.

1769
02:10:16,379 --> 02:10:16,739
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.

1770
02:10:16,759 --> 02:10:18,801
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to put it in the other drive and see what happens.

1771
02:10:18,881 --> 02:10:20,042
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fingerprints.

1772
02:10:20,062 --> 02:10:20,602
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, okay.

1773
02:10:20,662 --> 02:10:23,044
[SPEAKER_18]: So do a little clean up on that real fast.

1774
02:10:23,364 --> 02:10:23,844
[SPEAKER_18]: Try that again.

1775
02:10:23,884 --> 02:10:25,045
[SPEAKER_18]: Pretty big scratch right there.

1776
02:10:25,065 --> 02:10:27,007
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's a pretty big scratch in the middle.

1777
02:10:27,027 --> 02:10:28,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just finding my CD player out of my car.

1778
02:10:28,588 --> 02:10:29,729
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, let's try it.

1779
02:10:31,610 --> 02:10:33,012
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, we're going to restart this.

1780
02:10:33,052 --> 02:10:36,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, you need to play it out of the... This is the burner.

1781
02:10:37,057 --> 02:10:41,242
[SPEAKER_18]: So it wasn't playing out of the burner.

1782
02:10:41,282 --> 02:10:41,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that.

1783
02:10:42,123 --> 02:10:44,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have the MP3 of that with me.

1784
02:10:44,947 --> 02:10:45,948
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, we'll try it again.

1785
02:10:48,171 --> 02:10:48,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, everybody.

1786
02:10:48,852 --> 02:10:50,354
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's try it again.

1787
02:10:54,013 --> 02:10:56,896
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm gonna go ahead and take it in 30 seconds because it's about where we were at.

1788
02:10:58,157 --> 02:11:01,160
[SPEAKER_18]: I just have to, uh, get past the CDDB thing.

1789
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:01,901
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, let's try this again.

1790
02:11:01,941 --> 02:11:03,022
[SPEAKER_18]: Introduce the song one more time.

1791
02:11:03,242 --> 02:11:03,682
[SPEAKER_18]: From the start.

1792
02:11:03,803 --> 02:11:04,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Beatbox of the Wonderful World.

1793
02:11:04,944 --> 02:11:05,724
[SPEAKER_06]: 30 minutes in.

1794
02:13:56,905 --> 02:13:57,711
Thanks for watching!

1795
02:16:37,205 --> 02:16:38,306
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't like it very much.

1796
02:16:40,689 --> 02:16:45,533
[SPEAKER_17]: It was... I'm sorry, I don't like club mixes of songs like that.

1797
02:16:46,154 --> 02:16:48,436
[SPEAKER_17]: It just doesn't fit.

1798
02:16:48,656 --> 02:16:53,301
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone thinks that the formula for a dance song is let's put a beat to it and add lyrics from an old song.

1799
02:16:53,321 --> 02:16:54,562
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's not going to work.

1800
02:16:54,622 --> 02:16:55,243
[SPEAKER_17]: So, um...

1801
02:16:56,923 --> 02:17:01,049
[SPEAKER_17]: And then that part in the end where it started kind of doing this little thing where they started changing the pitch a little bit.

1802
02:17:01,309 --> 02:17:04,073
[SPEAKER_17]: Where it started getting way out of key and then coming back in.

1803
02:17:04,093 --> 02:17:05,354
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know what the hell that was either.

1804
02:17:05,855 --> 02:17:06,896
[SPEAKER_17]: So I give it a 6.

1805
02:17:07,317 --> 02:17:09,560
[SPEAKER_17]: Better than the other song, but still.

1806
02:17:10,221 --> 02:17:10,521
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, 0.

1807
02:17:12,083 --> 02:17:28,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Generally, I don't really care what it is, I don't like any type of dance to an old song, especially because that's an excellent song as it was originally, but this is a pretty good remake of it, it kind of tripped throughout a little bit, but I'll give it like a 7.

1808
02:17:29,991 --> 02:17:34,715
[SPEAKER_15]: I still did enjoy it though.

1809
02:17:36,336 --> 02:17:39,638
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I personally like that song.

1810
02:17:39,718 --> 02:17:44,041
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the variety, I like how it wasn't the same goddamn beat the whole way through.

1811
02:17:44,141 --> 02:17:46,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of it faded out, some of it faded back.

1812
02:17:48,184 --> 02:17:52,688
[SPEAKER_14]: And yes, I like this song too, the original, so I'm going to have to give that one a 10.

1813
02:17:52,828 --> 02:17:53,828
[SPEAKER_14]: Just because that's a happy song.

1814
02:17:53,868 --> 02:17:53,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay!

1815
02:17:53,988 --> 02:17:56,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, that was a happy song.

1816
02:17:56,710 --> 02:17:57,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very happy, happy.

1817
02:17:58,392 --> 02:17:59,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it.

1818
02:17:59,693 --> 02:18:04,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't too crazy about how the rhythm kind of reminded me of Beauty and Silence in there.

1819
02:18:04,616 --> 02:18:05,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little hint of that.

1820
02:18:06,137 --> 02:18:09,239
[SPEAKER_03]: But overall, it's a very nice sounding song.

1821
02:18:09,380 --> 02:18:11,701
[SPEAKER_03]: A little on the long side, but not too bad.

1822
02:18:11,901 --> 02:18:12,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give it an 8.

1823
02:18:14,183 --> 02:18:14,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1824
02:18:16,304 --> 02:18:16,745
[SPEAKER_18]: It's alright.

1825
02:18:17,881 --> 02:18:27,367
[SPEAKER_18]: It kind of made me a little bit sleepy, and when I hear it, I see a montage on the news of the slaughtering of RVGL children.

1826
02:18:30,229 --> 02:18:30,509
[SPEAKER_18]: I give it a 6.

1827
02:18:30,629 --> 02:18:31,210
[SPEAKER_18]: It's alright.

1828
02:18:32,774 --> 02:18:35,615
[SPEAKER_06]: That song makes my heart happy whenever I'm in a rotten mood.

1829
02:18:35,635 --> 02:18:40,176
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of the few songs that just makes me happy all over.

1830
02:18:40,256 --> 02:18:41,436
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, fair enough.

1831
02:18:41,636 --> 02:18:46,578
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, Twisted makes me happy, so... I'm sorry, Twisted made me vomit.

1832
02:18:46,758 --> 02:18:48,638
[SPEAKER_18]: Last pick of the night.

1833
02:18:49,099 --> 02:18:50,239
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, this should be interesting.

1834
02:18:50,279 --> 02:18:51,879
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, what are we going to hear?

1835
02:18:52,059 --> 02:18:53,400
[SPEAKER_17]: We heard this last week.

1836
02:18:53,520 --> 02:18:57,361
[SPEAKER_17]: I just couldn't think of anything else that I had with the two CDs that I had with me.

1837
02:18:58,101 --> 02:19:02,403
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is yet another original remix done by me.

1838
02:19:02,583 --> 02:19:06,766
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the Dark Black Forest, Midnight Angel mix.

1839
02:19:07,506 --> 02:19:12,308
[SPEAKER_17]: It's Loki versus Steve Reiner featuring Solaris.

1840
02:19:13,289 --> 02:19:14,149
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, here you go.

1841
02:20:44,437 --> 02:20:44,757
Wait, girl.

1842
02:20:44,837 --> 02:20:45,798
I know, but I'm waiting.

1843
02:20:45,818 --> 02:20:46,258
Where are we going?

1844
02:20:46,318 --> 02:20:46,858
Into the dark, black.

1845
02:22:03,082 --> 02:22:05,203
[SPEAKER_10]: to the Dark Black Forest.

1846
02:22:13,466 --> 02:22:13,886
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1847
02:22:14,727 --> 02:22:15,727
[SPEAKER_18]: What did y'all think of that one?

1848
02:22:16,007 --> 02:22:20,869
[SPEAKER_18]: That was Steve Reiner vs. Loki featuring Solaris with Dark Black Forest.

1849
02:22:21,309 --> 02:22:25,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep in mind that I'm trying to bypass my bias against Dark Black Forest.

1850
02:22:26,151 --> 02:22:26,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1851
02:22:26,551 --> 02:22:29,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm utterly sick and disgusted with that song.

1852
02:22:29,652 --> 02:22:31,213
[SPEAKER_06]: However, it was nicely done.

1853
02:22:32,381 --> 02:22:37,465
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's give it, and again I'm trying to bypass my bias, I give it a 7.77777.88.

1854
02:22:37,645 --> 02:22:37,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1855
02:22:37,845 --> 02:22:38,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

1856
02:22:48,016 --> 02:22:50,778
[SPEAKER_17]: As mentioned in the chatroom, it doesn't sound very remixed.

1857
02:22:50,818 --> 02:22:57,762
[SPEAKER_17]: There's actually a lot of subtle stuff and there's a few more synth things added to the actual main synths of the song.

1858
02:22:57,782 --> 02:22:59,743
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's kind of hard to detect that there.

1859
02:23:00,944 --> 02:23:10,069
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a mix between one song by Sonaris, I don't remember exactly what this song was called, and Dark Black Forest's Long Trip.

1860
02:23:11,090 --> 02:23:19,513
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how many more trips to the Dark Black Forest for me to take, but it was pretty good and Loki's right, there's a lot of subtle stuff, so for you people who didn't hear it, turn your

1861
02:23:38,610 --> 02:23:40,871
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to agree with the last two quotes.

1862
02:23:40,951 --> 02:23:43,431
[SPEAKER_15]: I give it an 8 just because I liked it.

1863
02:23:43,451 --> 02:23:48,832
[SPEAKER_15]: The beginning was kind of a little bit slow, but it was very repetitive to begin with, but then it picked up and I liked it every time.

1864
02:24:09,003 --> 02:24:14,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'll give it an 8, because I... Oh, wait a minute, I'm thinking backwards.

1865
02:24:14,327 --> 02:24:17,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm giving it a 7, because the previous song, I thought that was a little bit better.

1866
02:24:17,909 --> 02:24:19,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that other one.

1867
02:24:19,510 --> 02:24:25,474
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is good, but it does sound a little bit like the original, so I like the first or second entry the best.

1868
02:24:34,860 --> 02:24:36,841
[SPEAKER_18]: I would give it... I'd give it an 8.

1869
02:24:37,241 --> 02:24:37,761
[SPEAKER_18]: It was cool.

1870
02:24:37,861 --> 02:24:39,942
[SPEAKER_18]: It didn't make me as moist as Legend of Trance did.

1871
02:24:40,582 --> 02:24:44,524
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think the subtleness isn't... it's not enough.

1872
02:24:44,824 --> 02:24:45,964
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, we just need to do more.

1873
02:24:46,444 --> 02:24:47,545
[SPEAKER_18]: It was cool, but... yeah.

1874
02:24:47,625 --> 02:24:52,927
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it was cool, but it was just Dark Black Forest Long Trip with, like, some subtle synth.

1875
02:24:53,547 --> 02:24:57,088
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the next one's going to be totally different than the Trance remixes I've been doing.

1876
02:24:57,108 --> 02:25:02,010
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be an even more hardcore version of Sligo Works, so you're going to love it.

1877
02:25:03,150 --> 02:25:04,131
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, let's recap.

1878
02:25:04,151 --> 02:25:05,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting happy thinking about that.

1879
02:25:05,712 --> 02:25:06,513
[SPEAKER_18]: Quick recap.

1880
02:25:06,533 --> 02:25:06,953
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we go.

1881
02:25:07,013 --> 02:25:11,336
[SPEAKER_18]: These are the three things you can vote for and you can send your votes now over private message to Sky in the chat room.

1882
02:25:11,717 --> 02:25:15,800
[SPEAKER_18]: First one you can vote for, Svensson and Leland with Twisted.

1883
02:25:25,988 --> 02:25:27,929
[SPEAKER_18]: Second one you can vote for, Beatbox, right?

1884
02:25:27,949 --> 02:25:28,469
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that Beatbox?

1885
02:25:28,710 --> 02:25:31,512
[SPEAKER_18]: Beatbox with What a Wonderful World is the other one you can vote for.

1886
02:25:50,911 --> 02:25:58,277
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, and the third song you can vote for, Steve Reiner vs. Loki featuring Sonaris with Dark Black Forest.

1887
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:27,086
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, again, first song was Svensson and Gleeland with Twisted, second song was Beatbox, What a Wonderful World, third song was Steve Reiner vs. Loki featuring Sonaris with What a Wonderful World.

1888
02:26:27,126 --> 02:26:30,008
[SPEAKER_18]: I just thought of my next week's song, damn it, that sucks.

1889
02:26:30,288 --> 02:26:31,749
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, you just thought of the song you really wanted to do?

1890
02:26:31,769 --> 02:26:34,590
[SPEAKER_17]: I just thought of it, it was like in my car too, it was like, ah, next week.

1891
02:26:35,111 --> 02:26:39,193
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, so there you go, send your votes in now to Sky.

1892
02:26:39,233 --> 02:26:44,856
[SPEAKER_18]: In the meantime, we don't want to go right to a break because we just played a bunch of music, so let's try to chat it up a little bit, shall we?

1893
02:26:46,482 --> 02:26:47,843
[SPEAKER_18]: Who has something they want to talk about?

1894
02:26:49,143 --> 02:26:49,504
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki.

1895
02:26:50,204 --> 02:26:51,625
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, let's see.

1896
02:26:52,325 --> 02:26:53,246
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, Jackie?

1897
02:26:53,306 --> 02:26:53,626
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait.

1898
02:26:54,046 --> 02:26:56,487
[SPEAKER_17]: Haven't made a racial comment this week yet.

1899
02:26:57,308 --> 02:26:58,208
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, dear God.

1900
02:27:00,069 --> 02:27:01,190
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, good, because I'm not going to...

1901
02:27:02,822 --> 02:27:17,305
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to, but I was just thinking back to when we were talking over, like, food at TGI Fridays about my blank owner's club game where you have to train your people to eat fast.

1902
02:27:17,585 --> 02:27:19,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God, that was awful.

1903
02:27:21,286 --> 02:27:22,706
[SPEAKER_17]: But, no, we're not going to mention that.

1904
02:27:24,106 --> 02:27:25,787
[SPEAKER_17]: So, yeah.

1905
02:27:25,847 --> 02:27:27,307
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still like MoCap Bakery.

1906
02:27:28,384 --> 02:27:29,347
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what was yours?

1907
02:27:29,427 --> 02:27:33,801
[SPEAKER_06]: MoCap Hansel and Gretel, where you shove the little children into an oven.

1908
02:27:33,821 --> 02:27:35,125
[SPEAKER_18]: You shove little children into an oven.

1909
02:27:38,567 --> 02:27:50,150
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, let's see, big news, this week opening up was Dreamcatcher, and for all those, yeah, yeah, I agree, Dreamcatcher looked like ass, but you know what was before it?

1910
02:27:50,170 --> 02:27:53,791
[SPEAKER_17]: It was the final play of Osiris, and that kicks ass.

1911
02:27:54,592 --> 02:27:55,492
[SPEAKER_15]: I would go see it just for that.

1912
02:27:56,712 --> 02:28:02,234
[SPEAKER_15]: I would pay matinee prices just to go see that, and I'd just walk out of the movie.

1913
02:28:05,555 --> 02:28:05,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

1914
02:28:07,660 --> 02:28:08,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I have that on VCD.

1915
02:28:09,022 --> 02:28:09,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Ringu 2.

1916
02:28:10,704 --> 02:28:11,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Not 2.

1917
02:28:11,666 --> 02:28:11,105
1.

1918
02:28:11,786 --> 02:28:12,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1919
02:28:12,487 --> 02:28:13,508
[SPEAKER_03]: My mind is going again.

1920
02:28:15,571 --> 02:28:20,999
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, ever since Puppy introduced me to BitTorrent, I've been loving downloading things for free, like movies.

1921
02:28:21,459 --> 02:28:23,763
[SPEAKER_18]: And I downloaded that movie, Phone Booth, which...

1922
02:28:25,189 --> 02:28:25,769
[SPEAKER_18]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1923
02:28:55,455 --> 02:28:57,421
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I was getting... Phone booth.

1924
02:28:59,125 --> 02:29:00,886
[SPEAKER_18]: It's this new program.

1925
02:29:00,946 --> 02:29:02,087
[SPEAKER_18]: It's called BitTorrent.

1926
02:29:02,787 --> 02:29:07,850
[SPEAKER_18]: And if Black Lab has a link to that site he gave me, that would be cool.

1927
02:29:08,430 --> 02:29:13,613
[SPEAKER_18]: I would say it's like WinMX or something like that, but it's not.

1928
02:29:13,673 --> 02:29:16,494
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a little different because it's not a separate client.

1929
02:29:16,554 --> 02:29:19,276
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a download tool you install into your browser.

1930
02:29:19,696 --> 02:29:23,698
[SPEAKER_18]: So when you start downloading a file with a .torrent extension...

1931
02:29:25,579 --> 02:29:32,782
[SPEAKER_18]: What you do is you start downloading this file from, I guess, I don't know, it tells you where everybody else has the file.

1932
02:29:32,822 --> 02:29:34,323
[SPEAKER_18]: And you start downloading from people.

1933
02:29:34,743 --> 02:29:38,525
[SPEAKER_18]: And then as you're downloading it, when new people start downloads, they start downloading from you.

1934
02:29:39,085 --> 02:29:45,108
[SPEAKER_18]: So the key is to make it work, you have to leave your thing on for like a couple hours after you finish so other people can finish their stuff too.

1935
02:29:45,448 --> 02:29:47,869
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's a way of just basically file distribution.

1936
02:29:47,929 --> 02:29:49,670
[SPEAKER_18]: It's mass leeching and seeding and all that.

1937
02:29:50,510 --> 02:29:51,151
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's cool.

1938
02:29:52,431 --> 02:29:53,392
[SPEAKER_18]: How I've used it so far...

1939
02:29:54,975 --> 02:30:01,245
[SPEAKER_18]: I've gotten a couple CDs in a movie.

1940
02:30:01,585 --> 02:30:03,949
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm working on getting Final Fantasy Origins, but it's not finished yet.

1941
02:30:04,249 --> 02:30:07,414
[SPEAKER_18]: And I had to stop it because we had to start the show.

1942
02:30:07,454 --> 02:30:09,116
[SPEAKER_18]: The Final Fantasy 1 and 2 for America.

1943
02:30:10,129 --> 02:30:11,489
[SPEAKER_18]: I just got it!

1944
02:30:32,382 --> 02:30:45,371
[SPEAKER_03]: But if anybody out there has any advice or any experience playing .hack or, well, actually, I think Ice Princess has many good comments on the series, right?

1945
02:30:45,572 --> 02:30:45,672
[SPEAKER_03]: No?

1946
02:30:46,989 --> 02:30:48,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, .hack, no?

1947
02:30:48,850 --> 02:30:49,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Who was that?

1948
02:30:49,331 --> 02:30:50,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody was saying that this series was great.

1949
02:30:51,312 --> 02:30:51,932
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't remember.

1950
02:30:52,072 --> 02:30:52,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1951
02:30:53,313 --> 02:30:54,174
[SPEAKER_17]: I heard it was good.

1952
02:30:54,594 --> 02:30:55,454
[SPEAKER_17]: I've never seen it.

1953
02:30:55,655 --> 02:31:02,899
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, to be honest, to be honest looking at the game from the screenshots I've seen, it looks like ass, but, you know, I don't know.

1954
02:31:03,519 --> 02:31:05,661
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good enough to spawn two more sequels.

1955
02:31:07,202 --> 02:31:08,183
[SPEAKER_17]: Whoop-a-dee-doo!

1956
02:31:09,224 --> 02:31:12,306
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, look at, uh, let's see, uh, Saga Frontier.

1957
02:31:13,247 --> 02:31:14,368
[SPEAKER_17]: That game sucked ass.

1958
02:31:15,709 --> 02:31:18,111
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's an awful game.

1959
02:31:18,191 --> 02:31:19,993
[SPEAKER_17]: The first one was just crap.

1960
02:31:20,593 --> 02:31:25,097
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't even care about the other ones, you know, it's just, the first one ruined it for me, so I'm not playing anymore.

1961
02:31:25,257 --> 02:31:29,341
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, what would be another one that ruined it for me that they made so many sequels of?

1962
02:31:33,724 --> 02:31:37,147
[SPEAKER_17]: I never played Summoner, but I'm sure.

1963
02:31:39,149 --> 02:31:44,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Summoner did have one good thing about it, and that was that preview thing that they did based on the Dungeons & Dragons thing.

1964
02:31:45,634 --> 02:31:47,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Got any Dr. Pepper?

1965
02:31:47,996 --> 02:31:48,476
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Mountain Dew.

1966
02:31:48,716 --> 02:31:50,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Got any Mountain Dew?

1967
02:31:50,478 --> 02:31:53,240
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, yeah, it's in the fridge.

1968
02:31:54,081 --> 02:31:55,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I in the tavern yet?

1969
02:31:56,360 --> 02:31:57,242
[SPEAKER_05]: No, why?

1970
02:31:57,602 --> 02:32:01,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause if there's any hot chicks there, I want to do them!

1971
02:32:04,134 --> 02:32:07,255
[SPEAKER_17]: Tenshu, Wrath of Heaven, Wrath of Heaven, whatever.

1972
02:32:26,875 --> 02:32:37,660
[SPEAKER_15]: The first level is almost identical to the first level of their original Tenchu, but it's a lot more realistic, and the cutscenes when you stealthily kill somebody is awesome.

1973
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:38,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Their heads just pop right off.

1974
02:32:39,881 --> 02:32:42,082
[SPEAKER_15]: You jab them and you can kick cats and dogs.

1975
02:32:43,562 --> 02:32:44,182
[SPEAKER_15]: All kinds of stuff.

1976
02:32:44,223 --> 02:32:45,103
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actually pretty good.

1977
02:32:49,205 --> 02:32:50,525
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems really bloody, too.

1978
02:32:50,745 --> 02:32:51,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it more bloodier than the...

1979
02:32:52,925 --> 02:32:53,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Man!

1980
02:32:54,126 --> 02:33:04,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever seen like a Japanese soap opera or any Japanese programs where there's a lot of bloodshed and you see like somebody get cut in the throat and you see like 10 gallons of blood squirt out?

1981
02:33:04,369 --> 02:33:05,410
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what this game is like.

1982
02:33:05,510 --> 02:33:07,130
[SPEAKER_15]: The bloodshed is the whole point of that game.

1983
02:33:07,450 --> 02:33:11,972
[SPEAKER_15]: The bloodshed is the point of that game as to Resident Evil or anything else.

1984
02:33:12,332 --> 02:33:14,313
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just really, really cool.

1985
02:33:14,333 --> 02:33:17,334
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like asking why anime chicks have such big breasts.

1986
02:33:18,094 --> 02:33:18,914
[SPEAKER_15]: They just do.

1987
02:33:19,235 --> 02:33:20,175
[SPEAKER_15]: That is the point.

1988
02:33:22,213 --> 02:33:25,435
[SPEAKER_17]: No nipples.

1989
02:33:26,295 --> 02:33:27,856
[SPEAKER_17]: Why does Saga Frontier suck?

1990
02:33:27,956 --> 02:33:28,596
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see here.

1991
02:33:28,937 --> 02:33:33,399
[SPEAKER_17]: Not only do you get one shitty quest, but no, you get 12 shitty quests that you get to go on.

1992
02:33:33,419 --> 02:33:34,939
[SPEAKER_17]: They're almost exactly the same.

1993
02:33:35,800 --> 02:33:39,381
[SPEAKER_17]: Plus, the graphics sucked ass, and the game was just boring as hell.

1994
02:33:39,642 --> 02:33:40,602
[SPEAKER_15]: And the title's crappy.

1995
02:33:40,702 --> 02:33:43,043
[SPEAKER_17]: I ended up buying it, playing it for a week, and selling it back.

1996
02:33:44,084 --> 02:33:46,665
[SPEAKER_06]: And for the record, graphics do not equal gameplay.

1997
02:33:48,012 --> 02:33:53,836
[SPEAKER_17]: The gameplay wasn't anything good either, so I was like, well, maybe the graphics... No, no, sorry.

1998
02:33:54,697 --> 02:34:02,202
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm serious, if they had a role-playing game that was like just the regular text-scrolling ones that were from way back in the day, I can enjoy those more if they had a good story.

1999
02:34:02,222 --> 02:34:08,427
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what was freaking awesome is they're making this new side-scrolling game that's just like Contra, but you can make your own levels.

2000
02:34:09,067 --> 02:34:09,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's cool.

2001
02:34:09,568 --> 02:34:10,708
[SPEAKER_17]: It's got a level editor in it.

2002
02:34:10,969 --> 02:34:11,309
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

2003
02:34:11,329 --> 02:34:14,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I've been hearing that Unlimited Saga is supposed to be pretty redeeming.

2004
02:34:14,911 --> 02:34:16,833
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, see, well, yeah, it's about time.

2005
02:34:26,987 --> 02:34:33,512
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, we're going to come back after a quick break with results for both list lists, because we never did those, and the cage match.

2006
02:34:33,552 --> 02:34:35,914
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's going to be a whole results set when we come back from break.

2007
02:34:36,194 --> 02:34:39,277
[SPEAKER_18]: But first, the chat room would like to request no Saga Frontier bashing.

2008
02:34:42,505 --> 02:34:43,386
[SPEAKER_17]: It sucks ass.

2009
02:34:44,066 --> 02:34:48,990
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, Square should denounce Saga Partigris being part of their whole lineup.

2010
02:34:49,710 --> 02:34:51,952
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what game that Square needs to denounce?

2011
02:34:52,592 --> 02:34:55,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Is freaking Legend of Mana.

2012
02:34:57,655 --> 02:34:59,677
[SPEAKER_18]: No, not Secret of Mana, Legend of Mana.

2013
02:34:59,697 --> 02:35:00,777
[SPEAKER_18]: That game was shit.

2014
02:35:01,178 --> 02:35:07,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I was thinking, I went ahead and got the import of that because I was like, oh, you know, it's Legend of Mana, what the hell.

2015
02:35:07,402 --> 02:35:09,583
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking more Seiken Densetsu.

2016
02:35:10,024 --> 02:35:11,124
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was ass.

2017
02:35:12,085 --> 02:35:12,946
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2018
02:35:33,357 --> 02:35:33,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.

2019
02:35:34,558 --> 02:35:36,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, or just, you know, borrow my friend's cartridge for Super Nintendo.

2020
02:35:37,679 --> 02:35:39,860
[SPEAKER_15]: I bashed Saga Frontier in my sleep.

2021
02:35:40,540 --> 02:35:44,642
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a horrible game, and anyone who likes it, play it again.

2022
02:35:45,662 --> 02:35:51,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if Saga Frontier happens to sneak into my dreams, you know, then suddenly I wake up with the urge to vomit.

2023
02:35:53,786 --> 02:35:56,887
[SPEAKER_17]: Good, I'm done with one- Aw, dammit, there's more!

2024
02:35:57,387 --> 02:35:58,288
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing in his favor.

2025
02:35:58,988 --> 02:35:59,788
[SPEAKER_06]: It had good music.

2026
02:36:00,588 --> 02:36:01,429
[SPEAKER_06]: It had some good music.

2027
02:36:03,294 --> 02:36:06,215
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like that Rhapsody musical journey or whatever.

2028
02:36:06,235 --> 02:36:07,315
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to play that.

2029
02:36:07,595 --> 02:36:08,415
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked cute.

2030
02:36:08,635 --> 02:36:09,696
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually am getting it.

2031
02:36:10,016 --> 02:36:12,776
[SPEAKER_06]: One game that sucked?

2032
02:36:12,996 --> 02:36:13,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Rice Line.

2033
02:36:14,817 --> 02:36:16,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Ephemeral Fantasia.

2034
02:36:16,677 --> 02:36:17,357
[SPEAKER_06]: That game sucked.

2035
02:36:18,778 --> 02:36:21,378
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a game, it was put out, it was an RPG put out by Konami.

2036
02:36:21,958 --> 02:36:24,399
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently you can use your Guitar Freaks controller with it.

2037
02:36:25,569 --> 02:36:26,569
[SPEAKER_06]: That game is ass.

2038
02:36:26,649 --> 02:36:31,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan and I barely, we didn't even get past the first village before we packaged that shit up and turned it back in.

2039
02:36:32,251 --> 02:36:35,632
[SPEAKER_06]: We did not even go as far to see if our controllers would work with the US version.

2040
02:36:36,152 --> 02:36:37,032
[SPEAKER_06]: We took that shit back.

2041
02:36:38,952 --> 02:36:39,312
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2042
02:36:39,332 --> 02:36:40,673
[SPEAKER_06]: More like effeminate Fantasia.

2043
02:36:41,593 --> 02:36:42,353
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, you guys are ready?

2044
02:36:42,373 --> 02:36:43,253
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to take a quick break.

2045
02:36:43,653 --> 02:36:45,834
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're going to come back and we have two results to announce.

2046
02:36:45,954 --> 02:36:48,975
[SPEAKER_18]: So sit tight.

2047
02:36:48,995 --> 02:36:49,575
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be back.

2048
02:37:34,722 --> 02:37:39,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, 90's and 70's with the glue man, original Goldman style, Latin-style, a lot of my play style, set, hop!

2049
02:38:25,045 --> 02:38:25,829
Thanks for watching!

2050
02:40:12,025 --> 02:40:12,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Who shot the-

2051
02:40:53,958 --> 02:40:55,042
[SPEAKER_07]: and many more.

2052
02:41:27,137 --> 02:41:31,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

2053
02:41:31,699 --> 02:41:31,839
[SPEAKER_12]: No!

2054
02:41:31,859 --> 02:41:37,381
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we care what people think of us?

2055
02:41:38,022 --> 02:41:39,882
[SPEAKER_12]: No!

2056
02:41:39,902 --> 02:41:41,323
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

2057
02:41:41,783 --> 02:41:42,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes!

2058
02:41:45,877 --> 02:41:47,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Extreme Bobani Radio.

2059
02:41:47,938 --> 02:41:50,819
[SPEAKER_09]: That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

2060
02:41:52,259 --> 02:41:53,060
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we're back.

2061
02:41:53,560 --> 02:41:54,480
[SPEAKER_18]: Featuring the buzz.

2062
02:41:54,840 --> 02:41:56,481
[SPEAKER_18]: Episode number 37.

2063
02:41:57,781 --> 02:41:58,681
[SPEAKER_18]: Episode number 37.

2064
02:41:58,982 --> 02:41:59,662
[SPEAKER_18]: In a row.

2065
02:41:59,922 --> 02:42:00,182
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2066
02:42:00,362 --> 02:42:01,262
[SPEAKER_18]: Of Orange Lounge Radio.

2067
02:42:01,282 --> 02:42:01,683
[SPEAKER_18]: We're back.

2068
02:42:02,043 --> 02:42:04,243
[SPEAKER_18]: And we have results, results, results for you people.

2069
02:42:04,263 --> 02:42:06,084
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we're going to whore a few things out.

2070
02:42:06,104 --> 02:42:11,446
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to open it up to the chat room to plug anything they want.

2071
02:42:11,966 --> 02:42:14,147
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything they want to plug, you got...

2072
02:42:15,208 --> 02:42:16,389
[SPEAKER_18]: 15 minutes left to show to do it.

2073
02:42:16,429 --> 02:42:18,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be afraid of people plugging stuff in public.

2074
02:42:20,034 --> 02:42:24,139
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything you guys want to plug, send it to me over a private message and we'll plug it live on air.

2075
02:42:24,780 --> 02:42:26,863
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, and we got a few plugs of our own we want to do.

2076
02:42:26,883 --> 02:42:28,625
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to have Plugmania in a minute.

2077
02:42:29,226 --> 02:42:30,387
[SPEAKER_18]: In the meantime, let's announce.

2078
02:42:31,752 --> 02:42:34,033
[SPEAKER_18]: First, the winners of our listless segment.

2079
02:42:34,374 --> 02:42:37,916
[SPEAKER_18]: Top three things that Konami needs to apologize for.

2080
02:42:38,296 --> 02:42:38,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Number three.

2081
02:42:39,337 --> 02:42:40,037
[SPEAKER_18]: Number three.

2082
02:42:40,437 --> 02:42:40,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Bag.

2083
02:42:41,958 --> 02:42:42,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

2084
02:42:43,259 --> 02:42:44,160
[SPEAKER_18]: Please apologize.

2085
02:42:44,180 --> 02:42:47,422
[SPEAKER_18]: You can send those cards and letters care of all Bomani players.

2086
02:42:47,802 --> 02:42:48,142
[SPEAKER_18]: Bag.

2087
02:42:48,402 --> 02:42:49,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, Castlevania 64.

2088
02:42:50,744 --> 02:42:51,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Indeed.

2089
02:42:51,584 --> 02:42:54,666
[SPEAKER_18]: And you can write that to all of America for Castlevania 64.

2090
02:42:54,706 --> 02:42:55,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Apologies.

2091
02:42:55,587 --> 02:42:59,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one thing that Konami needs to apologize for is...

2092
02:43:00,808 --> 02:43:01,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck Impolitary.

2093
02:43:04,313 --> 02:43:05,956
[SPEAKER_18]: By quite a bit of a margin, should I add.

2094
02:43:05,976 --> 02:43:07,458
[SPEAKER_06]: She seems like she's being fucked.

2095
02:43:08,199 --> 02:43:10,162
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why she keeps going off key and rhythm.

2096
02:43:11,163 --> 02:43:11,484
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

2097
02:43:13,075 --> 02:43:15,257
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on, now let's announce the winner of the cage match.

2098
02:43:15,777 --> 02:43:18,059
[SPEAKER_18]: Cage match had a lot of votes tonight, you guys.

2099
02:43:18,099 --> 02:43:21,302
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm very happy, and it was actually kind of close.

2100
02:43:21,542 --> 02:43:22,723
[SPEAKER_18]: I was very surprised.

2101
02:43:23,104 --> 02:43:24,965
[SPEAKER_18]: Votes spread all across the board.

2102
02:43:25,386 --> 02:43:27,568
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a whiff today.

2103
02:43:28,028 --> 02:43:28,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Mr. Spanky.

2104
02:43:31,271 --> 02:43:32,232
[SPEAKER_18]: So, here it is.

2105
02:43:32,552 --> 02:43:38,017
[SPEAKER_18]: The winning song of this week's cage match was... was Silent.

2106
02:43:43,908 --> 02:43:46,109
[SPEAKER_18]: What a wonderful world wins the cage match this week.

2107
02:43:46,129 --> 02:43:47,690
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm full of happy feelings right now.

2108
02:43:47,911 --> 02:43:50,612
[SPEAKER_18]: So, enjoy.

2109
02:43:50,953 --> 02:43:52,714
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, let's see.

2110
02:43:54,035 --> 02:43:55,836
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to plug stuff.

2111
02:43:55,936 --> 02:43:58,558
[SPEAKER_18]: So, first thing we want to plug, there's tournaments we have to plug.

2112
02:43:59,598 --> 02:44:00,459
[SPEAKER_18]: In two weeks...

2113
02:44:01,673 --> 02:44:05,375
[SPEAKER_18]: We will be broadcasting live from March Madness.

2114
02:44:05,655 --> 02:44:06,875
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to be a huge tournament.

2115
02:44:07,376 --> 02:44:09,757
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR Freestyle Idol is a part of that.

2116
02:44:09,817 --> 02:44:11,718
[SPEAKER_18]: PA, 64 person bracket.

2117
02:44:11,758 --> 02:44:15,099
[SPEAKER_18]: So even if you suck at PA, come because you're going to qualify.

2118
02:44:15,139 --> 02:44:16,620
[SPEAKER_18]: With 64 people, that's awesome.

2119
02:44:16,740 --> 02:44:20,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to mention, I think the first NorCal 2DX tournament, right?

2120
02:44:21,357 --> 02:44:22,298
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2121
02:44:36,957 --> 02:44:40,179
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be broadcasting live both days, all day long.

2122
02:44:40,880 --> 02:44:41,640
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's something else.

2123
02:44:42,701 --> 02:44:46,803
[SPEAKER_18]: Join us in the channel and all that fun stuff.

2124
02:44:47,083 --> 02:44:54,067
[SPEAKER_18]: Another tournament we're going to be at in May, and I'm sure I've already gotten private messages asking me to plug this, so I'll get to those in a little bit.

2125
02:44:54,507 --> 02:44:56,568
[SPEAKER_18]: But B3, going to be huge.

2126
02:44:56,709 --> 02:45:02,672
[SPEAKER_18]: Pier 39, two days, I believe it's May, and I'm going to get killed if it's the wrong date, but I'm going off the top of my head.

2127
02:45:02,692 --> 02:45:03,492
[SPEAKER_18]: May 17th and 18th?

2128
02:45:03,532 --> 02:45:03,712
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes?

2129
02:45:04,013 --> 02:45:04,193
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes?

2130
02:45:04,913 --> 02:45:07,595
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to look at a calendar because I think I might be wrong.

2131
02:45:08,095 --> 02:45:09,716
[SPEAKER_18]: I have this really bad feeling I'm wrong.

2132
02:45:09,776 --> 02:45:11,798
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'm sure somebody asked me to plug it anyway.

2133
02:45:12,098 --> 02:45:12,518
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I'm right.

2134
02:45:12,558 --> 02:45:13,439
[SPEAKER_18]: It is 17th and 18th.

2135
02:45:13,479 --> 02:45:13,719
[SPEAKER_18]: Woohoo!

2136
02:45:14,139 --> 02:45:16,681
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so we'll be broadcasting live from there too.

2137
02:45:17,222 --> 02:45:21,885
[SPEAKER_18]: And then Season 3 of Orange Lounge Radio starts also in May.

2138
02:45:21,985 --> 02:45:26,548
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's going to be a big deal because we have a new toy that we're going to be bringing with us.

2139
02:45:26,848 --> 02:45:29,890
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't say anything about it because we don't know for sure we're going to have it yet.

2140
02:45:30,130 --> 02:45:31,071
[SPEAKER_18]: But we're trying very hard.

2141
02:45:31,531 --> 02:45:36,653
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're going to have a lot more wonderful interaction with audio-wise.

2142
02:45:36,733 --> 02:45:42,354
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to hook the hell out of TVs hooked up to the sound system and other things.

2143
02:45:42,374 --> 02:45:46,216
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to get to play porn on air and all that wonderful stuff.

2144
02:45:46,236 --> 02:45:47,136
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to be very interesting.

2145
02:45:47,276 --> 02:45:50,937
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, the other thing that's going to be different about Season 3 is that we're going to have a much larger studio.

2146
02:45:51,637 --> 02:45:52,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hell yeah.

2147
02:45:52,117 --> 02:45:53,338
[SPEAKER_18]: So that should be interesting, too.

2148
02:45:55,218 --> 02:45:56,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully we won't all suffocate to death.

2149
02:45:59,332 --> 02:46:01,955
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so let's see what the chat room wanted us to plug.

2150
02:46:02,295 --> 02:46:05,998
[SPEAKER_18]: Because they do this on late night talk shows, you know, they get to plug whatever they want when the guests come on.

2151
02:46:06,058 --> 02:46:08,160
[SPEAKER_18]: So, is there anything in here anyone would like to plug?

2152
02:46:08,200 --> 02:46:09,582
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't even have to be Vimani related.

2153
02:46:09,622 --> 02:46:10,362
[SPEAKER_18]: Something you want to plug.

2154
02:46:10,603 --> 02:46:11,423
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you need a date?

2155
02:46:11,724 --> 02:46:12,525
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you need money?

2156
02:46:12,825 --> 02:46:20,532
[SPEAKER_17]: As always, of course, it's going to be www.willddr4food.net slash leechfromloki.

2157
02:46:20,732 --> 02:46:21,573
[SPEAKER_17]: Can't forget that.

2158
02:46:21,913 --> 02:46:22,354
[SPEAKER_17]: Tomorrow...

2159
02:46:22,874 --> 02:46:24,075
[SPEAKER_17]: There will be an update.

2160
02:46:24,315 --> 02:46:26,737
[SPEAKER_17]: A couple hundred files will be coming up online.

2161
02:46:27,237 --> 02:46:28,818
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be the official stuff.

2162
02:46:29,238 --> 02:46:48,151
[SPEAKER_17]: Right now we've got prepped most of DDR Extreme, all of DDR First through Fifth Mix, DDR Solo, and I'm going to try to get Max and Max 2 done tonight as well as the other smaller ones like Oha and all those.

2163
02:46:48,471 --> 02:46:50,072
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I should be able to get those done tonight.

2164
02:46:50,292 --> 02:46:50,713
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll see.

2165
02:46:51,213 --> 02:46:52,354
[SPEAKER_17]: So those will be coming out tomorrow.

2166
02:46:55,643 --> 02:46:56,824
[SPEAKER_17]: Anybody else want to plug something in here?

2167
02:46:59,466 --> 02:47:00,386
[SPEAKER_18]: I need sex!

2168
02:47:02,328 --> 02:47:08,272
[SPEAKER_18]: And if they want to fuck the shit out of you, where should they email?

2169
02:47:08,292 --> 02:47:14,536
[SPEAKER_18]: 916-GO-CHEAP Or just look for them on the corner of 27th and J?

2170
02:47:14,556 --> 02:47:22,982
[SPEAKER_18]: 1-900-FUCK-ASS Alright, let's go through the chatroom and see what they want to plug.

2171
02:47:24,664 --> 02:47:48,442
[SPEAKER_18]: Justin Circuit would like us all to pay a visit to www.saifam.com So Justin Circuit is plugging Saifam, good Brack2000 would like to plug this site, www.capting.tk And I'm a little scared plugging sites I know nothing about So let's go visit it while Jamie plugs her thing

2172
02:47:49,699 --> 02:47:50,059
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

2173
02:47:51,821 --> 02:47:56,824
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also like to plug Wil Wheaton.net, just because Wil Wheaton's freaking hilarious.

2174
02:47:57,384 --> 02:47:58,825
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's one L, not two.

2175
02:47:59,986 --> 02:48:01,667
[SPEAKER_18]: Wil Wheaton.net is a hilarious site.

2176
02:48:01,707 --> 02:48:03,228
[SPEAKER_18]: Wil Wheaton is like the coolest guy.

2177
02:48:04,830 --> 02:48:11,494
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to plug www.ratemyrack.com Yeah.

2179
02:48:18,875 --> 02:48:20,977
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to plug, but I can't.

2180
02:48:20,997 --> 02:48:22,298
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, sorry.

2181
02:48:22,318 --> 02:48:25,079
[SPEAKER_18]: 23rd Magus says he would like to plug and chug www.unglued.tk

2182
02:48:39,276 --> 02:48:41,317
[SPEAKER_18]: or ungluedbomani.tk.

2183
02:48:41,357 --> 02:48:46,678
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure if they're two different sites or the same site, but visit them both, unglued.tk and ungluedbomani.tk.

2184
02:48:47,119 --> 02:48:49,059
[SPEAKER_18]: Fear some more and fear him the most.

2185
02:48:50,400 --> 02:48:50,920
[SPEAKER_15]: That's alright.

2186
02:48:51,360 --> 02:48:55,201
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're having a cake versus pie argument in the chat room right now.

2187
02:48:55,481 --> 02:48:57,242
[SPEAKER_18]: Quick, quick everybody, cake or pie?

2188
02:48:57,862 --> 02:48:58,182
Pie.

2189
02:48:58,582 --> 02:48:58,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Cake.

02:48:59,062 --> 02:49:00,443
[SPEAKER_18]: Cake.

[SPEAKER_14]: Cake.

02:49:03,344 --> 02:49:03,864
[SPEAKER_18]: I say pie.

2194
02:49:05,004 --> 02:49:05,544
[SPEAKER_18]: But you know what?

2195
02:49:05,624 --> 02:49:07,365
[SPEAKER_18]: Cheesecake owns them both.

2196
02:49:07,385 --> 02:49:07,645
[SPEAKER_18]: I like

2197
02:49:08,923 --> 02:49:10,044
[SPEAKER_18]: I like cake better than pie.

2198
02:49:10,564 --> 02:49:11,964
[SPEAKER_18]: Cheesecake owns them both.

2199
02:49:12,124 --> 02:49:12,725
[SPEAKER_18]: End of story.

2200
02:49:13,805 --> 02:49:14,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Ice cream cake.

2201
02:49:17,727 --> 02:49:18,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Cake pie.

2202
02:49:19,847 --> 02:49:21,568
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, cake flavored pie.

2203
02:49:22,328 --> 02:49:25,109
[SPEAKER_06]: For my birthday, I want an ice cream cake.

2204
02:49:25,350 --> 02:49:28,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a Colston one that's cake batter flavored with brownies in it.

2205
02:49:29,815 --> 02:49:31,716
[SPEAKER_17]: I want an erotic cake for my birthday.

2206
02:49:32,036 --> 02:49:34,376
[SPEAKER_17]: No, just like in the end of that Simpsons episode.

2207
02:49:35,017 --> 02:49:35,957
[SPEAKER_18]: A cake with boobies?

2208
02:49:36,157 --> 02:49:38,958
[SPEAKER_18]: My dad, for his 50th birthday, had a boobie cake.

2209
02:49:39,258 --> 02:49:44,939
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was a couple of big boobs that was a cake, and then it had like a little bra on it, and it had a skier skiing down one of the boobs.

2210
02:49:45,420 --> 02:49:46,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, slopes.

2211
02:49:46,400 --> 02:49:49,061
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, okay, enough of cake versus pie, we're done.

2212
02:49:49,541 --> 02:49:49,801
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

2213
02:49:50,601 --> 02:49:54,303
[SPEAKER_18]: AZHP wants us to plug NBOR3.

2214
02:49:54,863 --> 02:49:56,483
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good opportunity.

2215
02:49:56,503 --> 02:49:58,004
[SPEAKER_18]: I try to plug these occasionally.

2216
02:49:58,044 --> 02:50:01,125
[SPEAKER_18]: We all try to talk about our forums, but not enough people are going there.

2217
02:50:01,145 --> 02:50:02,486
[SPEAKER_18]: You need to visit our forums.

2218
02:50:02,846 --> 02:50:07,188
[SPEAKER_18]: They're at KaliBamani.com slash NBOR3.

2219
02:50:07,528 --> 02:50:08,068
[SPEAKER_18]: Or you know what?

2220
02:50:08,148 --> 02:50:12,430
[SPEAKER_18]: Even quicker, just go to KaliBamani.com and then click on forums.

2221
02:50:13,190 --> 02:50:13,470
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome.

2222
02:50:13,731 --> 02:50:16,252
[SPEAKER_18]: Or go to the Orange Lounge website and click on forums.

2223
02:50:16,272 --> 02:50:17,033
[SPEAKER_18]: They go to the same place.

2224
02:50:17,313 --> 02:50:18,034
[SPEAKER_18]: Visit the forums.

2225
02:50:18,134 --> 02:50:18,414
[SPEAKER_18]: Post.

2226
02:50:18,434 --> 02:50:19,635
[SPEAKER_18]: They're the best damn forums anywhere.

2227
02:50:20,035 --> 02:50:20,576
[SPEAKER_03]: They're good.

2228
02:50:20,836 --> 02:50:23,037
[SPEAKER_18]: Except for the Gold Club Center Volts forums, which are better.

2229
02:50:23,558 --> 02:50:24,198
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my gosh.

2230
02:50:24,218 --> 02:50:25,920
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a strip club, by the way.

2231
02:50:28,161 --> 02:50:29,841
[SPEAKER_17]: I would also like to plug Neopets.com.

2232
02:50:29,881 --> 02:50:32,222
[SPEAKER_17]: Go there, earn lots of Neopoints, and give them to me.

2233
02:50:58,112 --> 02:51:05,157
[SPEAKER_18]: Snub Dysphenoid would like to say, Paranoid Survivor Max Oni Steps has a max combo of 641 and has slides inside the final runs.

2234
02:51:05,457 --> 02:51:06,898
[SPEAKER_18]: How the hell can anyone pass that?

2235
02:51:06,938 --> 02:51:08,339
[SPEAKER_18]: Just thought I would share slash ask.

2236
02:51:08,620 --> 02:51:10,141
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not Ask Orange Lounge.

2237
02:51:10,361 --> 02:51:11,582
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, this isn't Ask Orange Lounge, sorry.

2238
02:51:14,642 --> 02:51:19,247
[SPEAKER_17]: Because slowly over time, playing DVR, you will slowly become Asian.

2239
02:51:20,529 --> 02:51:25,374
[SPEAKER_17]: Once you've achieved the ultimate Asian status, you will be able to pass that song.

2240
02:51:25,955 --> 02:51:29,539
[SPEAKER_17]: But only then will you be able to pass that song, and not before then.

2241
02:51:29,920 --> 02:51:31,602
[SPEAKER_17]: The machine must choose you.

2242
02:51:32,463 --> 02:51:34,405
[SPEAKER_17]: Then, you'll become the last starfighter.

2243
02:51:36,434 --> 02:51:39,777
[SPEAKER_18]: Japanman wants me to plug a site that's like a two-year-old internet joke.

2244
02:51:39,837 --> 02:51:42,198
[SPEAKER_18]: So when you find something funny that's new, let me know.

2245
02:51:43,039 --> 02:51:44,660
[SPEAKER_18]: Because Goatse is like two years old.

2246
02:51:45,161 --> 02:51:48,964
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2247
02:51:49,444 --> 02:51:53,067
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkTetsuya says that look out for his DWI for Love and the Angel.

2248
02:51:53,127 --> 02:51:53,827
[SPEAKER_18]: It's in the making.

2249
02:51:54,788 --> 02:51:56,770
[SPEAKER_18]: And will he be hosting that on Leach from Loki?

2250
02:51:56,850 --> 02:51:57,250
[SPEAKER_18]: Who knows?

2251
02:51:57,690 --> 02:51:58,111
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope so.

2252
02:52:00,452 --> 02:52:01,633
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's another thing about my site.

2253
02:52:01,673 --> 02:52:03,675
[SPEAKER_17]: Pretty soon it's going to be really easy to upload files.

2254
02:52:03,955 --> 02:52:05,216
[SPEAKER_17]: Like really, really, really easy.

2255
02:52:05,656 --> 02:52:06,337
[SPEAKER_17]: So, yeah.

2256
02:52:08,849 --> 02:52:14,592
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, MoreThanJake543 says, I need someone to do something that will make Rio shut down for a day.

2257
02:52:14,632 --> 02:52:15,232
[SPEAKER_18]: That's his school.

2258
02:52:16,453 --> 02:52:18,254
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, RateMyHuck.com.

2259
02:52:19,134 --> 02:52:22,316
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh-oh, I'm scared to know what a huck, I don't know what a huck is.

2260
02:52:22,856 --> 02:52:23,636
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see what a huck is.

2261
02:52:24,917 --> 02:52:26,538
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, let's find out, I hope so.

2262
02:52:26,638 --> 02:52:30,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, we're going to RateMyHuck.

2263
02:52:30,900 --> 02:52:31,940
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I wonder if it's vomit.

2264
02:52:32,040 --> 02:52:33,281
[SPEAKER_18]: Huck kind of sounds like vomit.

2265
02:52:35,402 --> 02:52:37,924
[SPEAKER_18]: No, because I'm going to rate my huck.

2266
02:52:37,984 --> 02:52:38,424
[SPEAKER_18]: Here it is.

2267
02:52:38,524 --> 02:52:40,145
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a Norwegian thing.

2268
02:52:40,525 --> 02:52:42,666
[SPEAKER_18]: If this is poop or something, I'm going to be pissed.

2269
02:52:44,247 --> 02:52:45,028
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, it's biking.

2270
02:52:45,148 --> 02:52:45,468
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2271
02:52:45,868 --> 02:52:46,169
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2272
02:52:47,209 --> 02:52:48,130
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, that I can do.

2273
02:52:48,430 --> 02:52:49,090
[SPEAKER_18]: That I can deal with.

2274
02:52:49,150 --> 02:52:52,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Rate my... Do they have ratemycock.com?

2275
02:52:52,913 --> 02:52:55,394
[SPEAKER_18]: This is like a bicycle thing.

2276
02:52:55,434 --> 02:52:56,275
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, that's fine.

2277
02:52:56,995 --> 02:52:58,076
[SPEAKER_18]: Rate my huck is acceptable.

2278
02:52:58,096 --> 02:52:59,116
[SPEAKER_06]: See if they have rate my cock.

2279
02:52:59,357 --> 02:52:59,997
[SPEAKER_18]: Rate my cock?

2280
02:53:00,057 --> 02:53:00,697
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, let's see.

2281
02:53:02,218 --> 02:53:03,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious about this.

2282
02:53:05,379 --> 02:53:06,500
[SPEAKER_18]: RateMyCock.com.

2283
02:53:06,540 --> 02:53:06,960
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going.

2284
02:53:08,001 --> 02:53:08,842
[SPEAKER_18]: Loading, loading, loading.

2285
02:53:09,643 --> 02:53:10,343
[SPEAKER_18]: Something's happening.

2286
02:53:10,363 --> 02:53:11,464
[SPEAKER_18]: Something's happening.

2287
02:53:11,544 --> 02:53:12,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shit.

2288
02:53:12,105 --> 02:53:12,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

2289
02:53:13,285 --> 02:53:13,806
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, you guys.

2290
02:53:13,826 --> 02:53:15,467
[SPEAKER_18]: It's probably trying to put a virus on my computer.

2291
02:53:17,349 --> 02:53:18,069
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, let's see.

2292
02:53:18,109 --> 02:53:18,630
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to enter.

2293
02:53:23,093 --> 02:53:25,515
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a RateMyCock.com.

2294
02:53:26,356 --> 02:53:28,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah!

2295
02:53:30,159 --> 02:53:30,940
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you guys think?

2296
02:53:32,081 --> 02:53:34,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I still think that the penis is the funniest looking thing in the world.

2297
02:53:35,427 --> 02:53:36,988
[SPEAKER_18]: Praise God for internet porn.

2298
02:53:38,049 --> 02:53:40,770
[SPEAKER_18]: I would give that, oh, I'd say about a five on size.

2299
02:53:41,931 --> 02:53:42,371
[SPEAKER_18]: Style?

2300
02:53:43,352 --> 02:53:44,373
[SPEAKER_18]: No, okay, I'll give it a seven.

2301
02:53:44,853 --> 02:53:45,353
[SPEAKER_18]: And style?

2302
02:53:45,413 --> 02:53:46,294
[SPEAKER_18]: Style's a little funky.

2303
02:53:46,314 --> 02:53:47,175
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's give it a five.

2304
02:53:47,915 --> 02:53:49,496
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, let's go to the next cock.

2305
02:53:49,556 --> 02:53:50,257
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's look at the next one.

2306
02:53:50,337 --> 02:53:53,238
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, we're going to look at one more cock, then we're done.

2307
02:53:54,639 --> 02:53:55,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Cock's name.

2308
02:53:56,260 --> 02:53:57,721
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my God!

2309
02:53:57,741 --> 02:53:59,482
[SPEAKER_18]: They have their name, and then they have the cock's name.

2310
02:53:59,502 --> 02:53:59,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God!

2311
02:54:01,484 --> 02:54:02,264
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I want him.

2312
02:54:03,505 --> 02:54:04,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, give that a ten all the way.

2313
02:54:05,367 --> 02:54:05,687
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2314
02:54:06,508 --> 02:54:08,570
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to log in to vote, and I'm not going to log in.

2315
02:54:09,011 --> 02:54:10,292
[SPEAKER_18]: So, there you go.

2316
02:54:10,833 --> 02:54:12,575
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you want to rate people's cock?

2317
02:54:12,655 --> 02:54:13,396
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is great.

2318
02:54:13,776 --> 02:54:17,700
[SPEAKER_18]: The greatest thing about the site, even if you're straight, this is funny, I swear.

2319
02:54:17,720 --> 02:54:21,804
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're a straight guy, this is still funny, because it has their name, and then their cock's name.

2320
02:54:21,884 --> 02:54:23,806
[SPEAKER_18]: That is so Photoshopped, okay?

2321
02:54:24,787 --> 02:54:25,228
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2322
02:54:25,788 --> 02:54:26,890
[SPEAKER_18]: God, I hope the neighbors aren't listening.

2323
02:54:27,010 --> 02:54:27,590
[SPEAKER_18]: More plugging!

2324
02:54:28,556 --> 02:54:34,558
[SPEAKER_18]: Saotome Ranma would like to plug www.starman.net as well as my huge, huge penis.

2325
02:54:35,579 --> 02:54:35,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2326
02:54:36,719 --> 02:54:38,100
[SPEAKER_18]: How many Neopoints do you need, Jamie?

2327
02:54:40,141 --> 02:54:43,322
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually about 30,000 away from my next bank account.

2328
02:54:43,342 --> 02:54:44,302
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take whatever I can get.

2329
02:54:44,462 --> 02:54:48,684
[SPEAKER_06]: My Neopets name is DJ underscore Celica.

2330
02:54:49,184 --> 02:54:49,625
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2331
02:54:50,545 --> 02:54:57,308
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, we got a lot of cool new listeners from Starman.net, so go visit them, especially if you like Earthbound, which you should because it was like the greatest Super Nintendo game ever.

2332
02:54:58,910 --> 02:55:02,351
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, 23rmagus would like to plug Pi, American Pie style.

2333
02:55:04,512 --> 02:55:08,773
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't need to know about your secret nighttime activities involving Pi.

2334
02:55:09,154 --> 02:55:12,115
[SPEAKER_18]: And Rice would like to... This is the greatest site.

2335
02:55:12,195 --> 02:55:14,195
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, in all seriousness, this is the greatest site.

2336
02:55:14,255 --> 02:55:15,996
[SPEAKER_18]: Rice is having us plug the greatest site.

2337
02:55:16,116 --> 02:55:19,377
[SPEAKER_18]: RYC3 would like us to plug RateMyKitten.com.

2338
02:55:19,417 --> 02:55:20,477
[SPEAKER_18]: It is the cutest site.

2339
02:55:20,497 --> 02:55:20,958
[SPEAKER_18]: No, let's go.

2340
02:55:20,978 --> 02:55:21,278
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's visit.

2341
02:55:21,318 --> 02:55:22,138
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's visit.

2342
02:55:22,198 --> 02:55:22,478
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2343
02:55:22,818 --> 02:55:24,419
[SPEAKER_05]: I should put pictures of Shermie on there.

2344
02:55:24,439 --> 02:55:24,919
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's visit.

2345
02:55:25,319 --> 02:55:26,940
[SPEAKER_18]: It's pussy that's actually good!

2346
02:55:32,020 --> 02:55:33,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanna see more kitties!

2347
02:55:33,861 --> 02:55:35,101
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanna see more kitties!

2348
02:55:35,121 --> 02:55:36,061
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanna see more kitties!

2349
02:55:51,704 --> 02:55:54,325
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I like doing this just for the sound effects, okay?

2350
02:55:54,625 --> 02:55:56,346
[SPEAKER_17]: This is great radio.

2351
02:55:56,446 --> 02:55:59,908
[SPEAKER_17]: This Indian's home has dinner all ready for tonight.

2352
02:56:01,149 --> 02:56:01,669
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, okay.

2353
02:56:02,089 --> 02:56:03,310
[SPEAKER_18]: One more, just for the sound effect.

2354
02:56:03,330 --> 02:56:03,670
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we go.

2355
02:56:03,730 --> 02:56:03,890
[SPEAKER_18]: Ready?

2356
02:56:03,990 --> 02:56:05,050
[SPEAKER_18]: One more, just for the sound effect.

2357
02:56:10,313 --> 02:56:14,075
[SPEAKER_18]: That one looked kind of mean, so it didn't get quite the reaction we were hoping for.

2358
02:56:14,115 --> 02:56:14,795
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, let's try this.

2359
02:56:17,456 --> 02:56:18,377
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, it's getting old.

2360
02:56:18,737 --> 02:56:19,277
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2361
02:56:20,358 --> 02:56:20,618
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2362
02:56:22,815 --> 02:56:23,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, go to this site.

2363
02:56:24,596 --> 02:56:25,336
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Rob.

2364
02:56:25,516 --> 02:56:25,977
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, hold on.

2365
02:56:25,997 --> 02:56:31,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to fire up the browser here.

2366
02:56:33,100 --> 02:56:35,681
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my cat, who owns all cats.

2367
02:56:36,981 --> 02:56:38,302
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to post this in the chat room, too.

2368
02:56:38,822 --> 02:56:39,542
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, that's cute.

2369
02:56:39,562 --> 02:56:41,223
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Shermie sleeping in a pizza box.

2370
02:56:43,804 --> 02:56:46,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Shermie is a big cat.

2371
02:56:46,745 --> 02:56:49,987
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got to realize that when this cat is standing up and walking around, it looks like a soccer ball.

2372
02:56:51,186 --> 02:56:52,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

2373
02:57:18,829 --> 02:57:19,789
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of Jamie's toys.

2374
02:57:20,510 --> 02:57:24,211
[SPEAKER_06]: And your keyboard maniac controller.

2375
02:57:24,611 --> 02:57:27,232
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, me and my friend were playing Vice City is Placed.

2376
02:57:27,272 --> 02:57:27,892
[SPEAKER_18]: Then what happens?

2377
02:57:27,912 --> 02:57:31,134
[SPEAKER_18]: He starts firing at some cops when this black man just jumps on the bike.

2378
02:57:32,014 --> 02:57:33,655
[SPEAKER_18]: I think he came from this hole.

2379
02:57:34,335 --> 02:57:34,675
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2380
02:57:34,935 --> 02:57:37,596
[SPEAKER_18]: So he found a man-whore in Vice City, I guess.

2381
02:57:37,616 --> 02:57:38,696
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like some big deal.

2382
02:57:38,917 --> 02:57:39,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

2383
02:57:41,558 --> 02:57:42,458
[SPEAKER_18]: That's beautiful.

2384
02:57:42,478 --> 02:57:42,758
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow.

2385
02:57:45,183 --> 02:57:50,289
[SPEAKER_18]: MoreThanJake would like us to plug CollegeHumor.com and MyCatHatesYou.com.

2386
02:57:51,110 --> 02:57:51,831
[SPEAKER_18]: Ooh, the other side of it.

2387
02:57:51,871 --> 02:57:52,151
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.

2388
02:57:52,211 --> 02:57:52,872
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's have a look at it.

2389
02:57:52,992 --> 02:57:56,437
[SPEAKER_18]: MyCatHatesYou.com.

2390
02:57:57,738 --> 02:57:58,659
[SPEAKER_18]: Has a mean little kitty.

2391
02:57:58,800 --> 02:58:00,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

2392
02:58:00,522 --> 02:58:01,563
[SPEAKER_18]: I've seen that picture over email.

2393
02:58:01,643 --> 02:58:01,923
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

2394
02:58:01,963 --> 02:58:02,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I know about that.

2395
02:58:05,060 --> 02:58:06,541
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, these are all, like, mean cats.

2396
02:58:06,821 --> 02:58:07,502
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that's a cool one.

2397
02:58:07,522 --> 02:58:07,742
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, okay.

2398
02:58:07,962 --> 02:58:09,042
[SPEAKER_17]: This is an awesome site.

2399
02:58:09,263 --> 02:58:18,428
[SPEAKER_17]: It's, uh, http dot, or it's actually, um, Maddox, M-A-D-D-O-X dot xmission dot com.

2400
02:58:21,150 --> 02:58:21,570
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, oops.

2401
02:58:21,590 --> 02:58:22,330
[SPEAKER_17]: No www.

2402
02:58:22,691 --> 02:58:23,371
[SPEAKER_18]: No www.

2403
02:58:25,833 --> 02:58:26,593
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, here we go.

2404
02:58:28,154 --> 02:58:29,475
[SPEAKER_18]: The best page in the universe.

2405
02:58:29,535 --> 02:58:32,437
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, is this the one where he rips on the little kid's arm and stuff?

2406
02:58:32,457 --> 02:58:33,757
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, but there's much more of that.

2407
02:58:33,777 --> 02:58:34,318
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see here.

2408
02:58:35,920 --> 02:58:39,142
[SPEAKER_18]: Who would make a better president, Bush or a box of Tic Tacs?

2409
02:58:40,303 --> 02:58:40,983
[SPEAKER_18]: That's beautiful.

2410
02:58:41,504 --> 02:58:42,945
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait, wait, look at this picture.

2411
02:58:43,005 --> 02:58:46,627
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, here we go.

2412
02:58:50,349 --> 02:58:50,850
[SPEAKER_18]: Wonderful.

2413
02:58:51,850 --> 02:58:58,314
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, so I'm going to post that to the chat room if they'd like to check out that little ball of joy.

2414
02:58:59,715 --> 02:59:02,197
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see what Shark Skrull wanted us to plug.

2415
02:59:04,645 --> 02:59:06,025
[SPEAKER_18]: I like ramen, I like porn

2416
02:59:27,466 --> 02:59:29,227
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, it is a porn site.

2417
02:59:29,607 --> 02:59:29,947
[SPEAKER_18]: Beautiful.

2418
02:59:30,447 --> 02:59:34,988
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also like to plug cospa.co.jp, C-O-S-P-A.

2419
02:59:35,909 --> 02:59:45,772
[SPEAKER_06]: For any cosplayers, it's a site that sells pre-made cosplay pieces, but also it's very good images on things that you can make for your own costumes.

2420
02:59:45,792 --> 02:59:53,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, tokyostreets.com, for anyone who's into the whole fruits fashion, has pictures of street fashion in Tokyo.

2421
02:59:53,974 --> 02:59:57,516
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, 23rd Magnus would like a way to plug my BWC.

2422
02:59:58,577 --> 02:59:59,557
[SPEAKER_04]: His big white cock?

2423
02:59:59,697 --> 03:00:00,138
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

2424
03:00:01,138 --> 03:00:01,438
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2425
03:00:02,039 --> 03:00:05,241
[SPEAKER_18]: These are the last plugs, you guys, and we're going to end the show, get the final thoughts, end the show.

2426
03:00:05,681 --> 03:00:08,523
[SPEAKER_18]: Brack2000 wants to plug EmotionEric.com.

2427
03:00:08,623 --> 03:00:10,144
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, this site is very cool.

2428
03:00:10,204 --> 03:00:10,624
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2429
03:00:10,964 --> 03:00:11,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for plugging this.

2430
03:00:11,985 --> 03:00:12,805
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a great site.

2431
03:00:13,145 --> 03:00:18,068
[SPEAKER_18]: This is this guy, and all he does is he emotes things.

2432
03:00:18,989 --> 03:00:20,390
[SPEAKER_18]: So let me show you, like here.

2433
03:00:20,670 --> 03:00:22,131
[SPEAKER_18]: God damn, these fucking pop-up ads.

2434
03:00:23,471 --> 03:00:25,192
[SPEAKER_18]: Hold on, Alt-F4, gone.

2435
03:00:25,552 --> 03:00:28,472
[SPEAKER_18]: So, let's see, this is the emote icon for love.

2436
03:00:29,593 --> 03:00:30,273
[SPEAKER_18]: Aw, isn't that cute?

2437
03:00:30,413 --> 03:00:31,793
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the emote icon for drunk.

2438
03:00:33,594 --> 03:00:43,216
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we get to, like, kill number three, finding dead body in the trunk, freedom,

2439
03:00:46,221 --> 03:00:47,941
[SPEAKER_18]: So emotioneric.com.

2440
03:00:48,422 --> 03:00:48,722
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

2441
03:00:49,182 --> 03:00:50,502
[SPEAKER_18]: And then he has pending requests.

2442
03:00:50,762 --> 03:00:53,043
[SPEAKER_18]: He also takes requests like Yoga Fire and things like that.

2443
03:00:53,903 --> 03:00:55,863
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2444
03:00:55,963 --> 03:00:56,983
[SPEAKER_18]: What is the request?

2445
03:00:57,063 --> 03:00:58,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Homestar Runner.

2446
03:00:58,084 --> 03:00:58,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Rise Princess?

2447
03:00:58,884 --> 03:00:59,484
[SPEAKER_18]: Homestar Runner.

2448
03:00:59,804 --> 03:01:00,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2449
03:01:00,224 --> 03:01:00,544
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it that?

2450
03:01:00,944 --> 03:01:03,385
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure everybody on the internet has seen that already.

2451
03:01:03,465 --> 03:01:04,505
[SPEAKER_18]: Late, late, ending late.

2452
03:01:04,545 --> 03:01:05,145
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, big deal.

2453
03:01:05,565 --> 03:01:05,905
[SPEAKER_06]: So what?

2454
03:01:05,965 --> 03:01:06,465
[SPEAKER_06]: It's our show.

2455
03:01:08,166 --> 03:01:10,526
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Kelly Bomani says, I would never go to a site like that.

2456
03:01:10,566 --> 03:01:11,126
[SPEAKER_18]: Sean found it.

2457
03:01:11,487 --> 03:01:11,687
No.

2458
03:01:12,347 --> 03:01:12,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

2459
03:01:12,667 --> 03:01:13,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

2460
03:01:14,586 --> 03:01:22,396
[SPEAKER_18]: I want Loki to read on air the article Maddox wrote about vegetarianism for morals on the Maddox.xmission.com.

2461
03:01:31,306 --> 03:01:31,887
[SPEAKER_18]: You up for it?

2462
03:01:33,148 --> 03:01:35,690
[SPEAKER_17]: I've read all of his articles, so... Where's the vegetarian one?

2463
03:01:36,010 --> 03:01:36,631
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, let me find it.

2464
03:01:36,671 --> 03:01:38,032
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, no.

2465
03:01:38,252 --> 03:01:40,855
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the continuity one with Daredevil the movie.

2466
03:01:41,055 --> 03:01:42,616
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, let's see here.

2467
03:01:42,636 --> 03:01:45,499
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, oh, this one's funny too, but I'm not going to read that one.

2468
03:01:45,799 --> 03:01:48,642
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, PETA, Preventing Suffering... Yeah.

2469
03:01:48,662 --> 03:01:50,343
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait, that's hate mail, I think.

2470
03:01:50,463 --> 03:01:50,884
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

2471
03:01:52,145 --> 03:01:53,066
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, that might be the one.

2472
03:01:53,086 --> 03:01:53,626
[SPEAKER_17]: Really?

2473
03:01:53,666 --> 03:01:53,846
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

2474
03:01:56,089 --> 03:01:58,030
[SPEAKER_17]: It's about the guiltless grill and something like that.

2475
03:01:59,331 --> 03:02:00,532
[SPEAKER_18]: Make it quick, we gotta end the show.

2476
03:02:00,832 --> 03:02:01,772
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a long fucking article.

2477
03:02:01,792 --> 03:02:02,413
[SPEAKER_17]: First paragraph.

2478
03:02:02,653 --> 03:02:02,893
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2479
03:02:03,273 --> 03:02:07,675
[SPEAKER_17]: PETA stands for People Before the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

2480
03:02:07,735 --> 03:02:09,136
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's ignore that for a moment.

2481
03:02:09,176 --> 03:02:15,079
[SPEAKER_17]: That implies that there exists a universal set of ethics instead of let's focus on the meat of this email.

2482
03:02:15,159 --> 03:02:18,341
[SPEAKER_17]: PETA is primarily concerned with preventing suffering of living animals.

2483
03:02:18,701 --> 03:02:19,161
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, really?

2484
03:02:19,262 --> 03:02:21,583
[SPEAKER_17]: As opposed to preventing the suffering of dead animals?

2485
03:02:22,244 --> 03:02:29,970
[SPEAKER_17]: Good thing they clarified that because I was confused and couldn't infer that they were saying animals that they didn't mean dead animals.

2486
03:02:30,430 --> 03:02:31,491
[SPEAKER_17]: Glad we have cleared that up.

2487
03:02:31,511 --> 03:02:32,071
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's move on.

2488
03:02:32,292 --> 03:02:39,938
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways, to basically summarize that, he's just telling that more animals get killed in the harvesting of grain than bias.

2489
03:02:40,018 --> 03:02:45,742
[SPEAKER_17]: And so what he says is for every one piece of, like, or every steak that they're not going to eat, he's going to eat three.

2490
03:02:47,804 --> 03:02:48,744
[SPEAKER_17]: That's awful.

2491
03:02:49,645 --> 03:02:50,045
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

2492
03:02:52,547 --> 03:02:58,571
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm getting asked to play the second song that JB sent me, which I will do after the show is over.

2493
03:02:58,931 --> 03:03:00,812
[SPEAKER_18]: So, let's get to those final thoughts.

2494
03:03:01,773 --> 03:03:02,433
[SPEAKER_18]: Guess first.

2495
03:03:02,754 --> 03:03:02,994
[SPEAKER_18]: Zero?

2496
03:03:08,727 --> 03:03:20,434
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess my final thought is pretty much have as many parties as you possibly can because they're really fun and you can get drunk and you can make an ass out of yourself.

2497
03:03:25,117 --> 03:03:27,819
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to say in that motion, ass is good but then so is booze.

2498
03:03:31,156 --> 03:03:34,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, okay, I don't think you said ass is good and so are boobs.

2499
03:03:35,998 --> 03:03:36,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

2500
03:03:37,338 --> 03:03:38,219
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, let me clarify.

2501
03:03:38,519 --> 03:03:40,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Ass is good and so is booze.

2502
03:03:40,800 --> 03:03:41,540
[SPEAKER_14]: That's an alcohol.

2503
03:03:42,400 --> 03:03:44,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, glad we clarified that.

2504
03:03:45,081 --> 03:03:47,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, my final thought, uh, be happy.

2505
03:03:47,923 --> 03:03:48,603
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I gotta say.

2506
03:03:50,203 --> 03:03:52,584
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is black CD-Rs are really red.

2507
03:03:56,486 --> 03:03:56,566
[SPEAKER_17]: Um...

2508
03:03:58,422 --> 03:03:59,563
[SPEAKER_17]: Vegetarians suck.

2509
03:03:59,583 --> 03:04:01,404
[SPEAKER_17]: You should eat all the meat that's possible.

2510
03:04:01,685 --> 03:04:03,146
[SPEAKER_17]: Otherwise, cows go to waste.

2511
03:04:03,446 --> 03:04:04,406
[SPEAKER_18]: You care to counter that?

2512
03:04:08,649 --> 03:04:09,650
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucked.

2513
03:04:11,291 --> 03:04:12,992
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you who don't know, I am a vegetarian.

2514
03:04:15,314 --> 03:04:17,775
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't eat cows or pigs because I don't want a heart attack.

2515
03:04:19,056 --> 03:04:20,357
[SPEAKER_15]: I say we just eat the vegetarians.

2516
03:04:21,760 --> 03:04:23,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that doesn't make sense.

2517
03:04:23,202 --> 03:04:26,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be cannibalism.

2518
03:04:26,765 --> 03:04:27,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I could go into this.

2519
03:04:27,386 --> 03:04:28,227
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just too long.

2520
03:04:29,108 --> 03:04:31,290
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we trap your soul and make you watch your body rot.

2521
03:04:31,310 --> 03:04:31,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

2522
03:04:32,491 --> 03:04:33,912
[SPEAKER_17]: Salad or beef!

2523
03:04:35,674 --> 03:04:36,335
[SPEAKER_14]: Beef it is!

2524
03:04:36,555 --> 03:04:37,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Sausage is always good for me.

2525
03:04:38,953 --> 03:04:40,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop it with the gay references!

2526
03:04:41,735 --> 03:04:43,557
[SPEAKER_18]: Did everybody get to do their final thought except me?

2527
03:04:43,817 --> 03:04:47,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I want to know if Loki would kill his own cow to get his beef.

2528
03:04:48,381 --> 03:04:53,625
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, damn, that'd be fun!

2529
03:04:53,825 --> 03:05:04,174
[SPEAKER_06]: In reference to that, Dennis Leary did have the best funny, the funniest thing regarding being pro meat eating, and that was, bring out a live cow, I'll carve off what I want and ride the rest home.

2530
03:05:06,179 --> 03:05:10,003
[SPEAKER_06]: And if one of the meat eaters had a heart attack and fell over, we'd just throw him in the pit too.

2531
03:05:10,083 --> 03:05:11,004
[SPEAKER_06]: More meat for the meat eaters.

2532
03:05:12,085 --> 03:05:13,227
[SPEAKER_15]: I wouldn't kill my cow.

2533
03:05:13,327 --> 03:05:16,510
[SPEAKER_15]: I would get a guy cow and make them have more cows.

2534
03:05:16,711 --> 03:05:17,952
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I would kill them and eat them.

2535
03:05:19,033 --> 03:05:19,414
[SPEAKER_18]: Beautiful.

2536
03:05:20,415 --> 03:05:23,018
[SPEAKER_18]: My final thought for the day is Kuntai.

2537
03:05:23,198 --> 03:05:23,578
[SPEAKER_18]: Good night.

2538
03:05:26,354 --> 03:05:29,336
[SPEAKER_09]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2539
03:05:29,916 --> 03:05:33,239

2542
03:05:46,307 --> 03:05:49,730

2543
03:05:56,169 --> 03:05:58,830
[SPEAKER_13]: Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

2544
03:05:59,731 --> 03:06:01,371
[SPEAKER_13]: Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure.

2545
03:06:01,391 --> 03:06:02,532
[SPEAKER_13]: We're honored by your presence.

2547

[SPEAKER_13]: Man, don't think that you be cruisin' down here to check out this ride.

2551
