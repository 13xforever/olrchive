65680	68062	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
68322	70043	Why did they have to take the word day?
71665	74327	No one expects a Spanish exposition.
74567	75387	It's Kendo.
75467	75908	Hey!
78240	80043	DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio,
97961	102166	We are live and this is episode number 37 for March 9th.
102306	103067	No, it's not the 9th.
103107	104869	It's the 16th of 2003.
105029	106812	Rob's doing the time warp again.
106852	107312	Hello.
107693	112498	You're tuned into the Mamani Scene's most buzzing radio station of all things Mamani.
112819	113920	My name is Rob Roberts.
114080	115041	You might know me as Sky.
116041	117781	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
117801	120222	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers.
120262	121522	You know her better as DarkSakura.
121562	122202	I'm not happy.
122942	124843	In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.
125143	125423	Hello.
126563	130044	And with us here also in the studio tonight, we have... Here!
130084	130704	Nobody!
131084	132124	This is amazing!
132504	134125	There is nobody else here tonight.
134205	135425	It is just the three of us.
135585	136565	This is craziness.
137285	138045	Zero's not even here.
138065	138926	He was supposed to be here tonight.
139366	140346	Yeah, I guess.
140746	140846	And...
141926	143487	Brad and Irene said they were going to be here tonight.
143647	145787	We need to make our intern do something really crazy.
145907	147188	That is messed up.
147448	149288	So it's just us here feeling the love.
149529	153330	But we also have the mic, microphone, making lots of noise to entertain us.
153390	154170	We apologize.
154210	156291	We know we have a really badly buzzing microphone.
156311	157531	We're doing what we can about it.
158291	159672	But we really don't know.
159712	160652	We're kind of out of options.
160692	163273	We've rearranged the whole room here.
163673	165753	And we think the subwoofer might be contributing to it.
166774	167214	I don't think this...
167694	168295	Mine does that.
169035	173540	I can turn off the subwoofer, and then we won't hear anything, but I think they still get the buzzing even with the subwoofers off.
174601	175682	But, I don't know.
176202	178925	So, life sucks, and you'll just have to bear with us tonight.
178945	180026	We'll do what we can.
182108	185411	But in the meantime, we're going to play some break songs.
185832	187213	And what songs are we going to hear this break?
187273	188594	These are songs that no one listens to.
188675	191277	These are songs that no one listens to, but you're going to now, so enjoy.
191537	191958	We'll be back.
192970	197598	Check one, check one, when I come down, I come down right to the sun.
197899	200564	Get right down, get right down to the gym.
200584	201325	Round and round.
220883	223145	I'm a friend of the best Who's in the juice?
263540	264561	L-O-V-E-N-S L-O-V-E-N-S
572076	572496	Hello?
573277	573558	Hello?
573598	574298	Is this thing on?
574358	574859	Testing.
576040	576901	Testing 1-2.
577482	581426	I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.
581526	582006	Hello?
582667	584129	I don't understand this.
584149	585510	Does this thing work?
585530	587132	This thing reads like stereo instructions.
587212	587913	Is this on?
587933	589494	What the hell?
590836	592237	Orange Lounge Radio.
592417	594499	Broke down Get Open Body Radio.
602304	602945	Yeah, hello!
617319	618380	Thank you for watching!
652256	653418	Thank you for watching!
661160	661861	All right, enough of that.
662702	664183	We were supposed to be back before that was over.
664223	665544	Apologies about that.
665624	666945	Is that irony or what?
667205	670768	That, you know, broke down ghetto-ass radio and then we can't even get our fucking volume.
670788	671548	We can't get it up.
671568	672989	We're impotent.
673390	683077	We actually, what's funny is that during the break I was trying to fix the buzzing problem we've got tonight and I went behind the computer and kind of unplugged the splitter because Loki said, hey, look at the splitter.
683117	683898	Maybe something's wrong with that.
684298	686900	And lo and behold, I went and I plugged it back in the wrong hole.
687901	689182	I stuck it in the wrong hole.
691821	693943	Okay, Rob, do you have whole priorities here?
694163	695264	Yeah, I have whole problems.
695405	696546	I think I'm dyslexic!
697987	705614	Anyway, in that break of Little Played Bomani songs, pretty controversial in the chatroom, because every time one of them would play something, we'd go, hey, I'd play that.
707196	709418	How many people really play Minimalian?
709478	709899	Thank you.
710461	716924	We had Chiang Ma with Love This Feelin' and then Minimalin from 4th Style, which was also the background music in 3rd Style, if I'm not mistaken.
718185	718805	Yes, I think so.
719225	723588	And then after that, the Sampling Masters with Tablets from 5th Style.
723988	728270	And then Usama Kubota with Presto, which is somewhat debatable because actually a lot of people play that song.
728650	732132	But what happened is I was actually looking for 5 Regrets and I couldn't find it.
732752	738375	So then I tried to find, I was going to put 1989 in, but a lot of people would have beat me up if I played 1989.
738435	739396	I actually kind of like it.
741132	743333	I should have played Entrance.
743473	745274	Yeah, that was the one I was trying to think of, I think.
745294	745675	Yay!
762899	766466	Every Kubota song could have been in Keyboard Mania.
766486	767227	Presto was.
767287	767808	Yes, Presto was.
772721	776863	Um, you are listening to Orange House Radio, and again, we apologize for having some buzzing issues tonight.
776903	777964	We don't know what's causing it.
778024	780265	We've dissected everything going on.
780285	785427	About the only way I think I'd be able to... The bee is angry for, you know, you defacing its song.
787048	789069	So, I don't know what we can do about it.
789229	790930	We'll just have to bear with it tonight.
790950	792650	Although it has been worse in the past.
792670	796832	The one episode we did, it was just unbearable almost, but we did it anyway.
797473	799774	And you guys stuck with us because you love us, and we love you.
801094	808041	You were funny last night, you were drunk You were drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk Giggling and then I fell asleep
819102	830170	Last night, Zero, the Orange Lounge intern, had a little get-together at his house, and we decided to do a little bit of drinking, because it was mostly older folks that were there, over 21, so we decided to bust out a little bit of liquor.
831211	833953	I had my one triple shot of that imported tequila.
834214	836335	I had about half a glass of Aftershock.
836856	838417	Not a shot, but half a glass.
838577	840238	I had half a glass of Aftershock.
840258	842540	I had whatever it was that Irene made me.
842700	843621	It was yummy.
843801	847624	Irene knew what I'd been needing for about the past year, and Irene made me a cocksucker.
848496	851457	Which is Irish cream mixed with butterscotch schnapps.
851937	853637	And again, she didn't make me a shot.
853718	854898	It's supposed to be a shot drink.
855818	857158	I was made a full glass.
857719	858499	That was yummy though.
858739	861460	Yeah, and I drank just about the whole thing except for a couple sips.
861900	865861	So needless to say, after half a glass of Aftershock and that, I was pretty fucked up.
866661	869602	So, I don't know, I was running around the house yelling things.
869722	870882	I don't know what I was doing when I was drunk.
870902	871322	I fell asleep.
871943	873563	And then I fell asleep too after my mouth.
873583	876084	It took like about 45 minutes and that was it.
876904	877844	Was that how long I was awake?
877864	878745	It wasn't long at all.
878865	880425	I'm like, the rub's drunk.
880445	881505	I'm like, already?
881666	882426	Shit, man.
882446	885687	I didn't even finish setting up the pads yet and you're already drunk.
885707	886667	Hey, wait a minute.
886847	887447	Wait a minute.
889288	890928	That's not because you guys ran to the store.
893469	895470	Poor Ice Queen spent a bunch on liquor.
895730	897870	Which reminds me, he's not here and he's supposed to be.
897930	899611	I need to call him and see where he's at.
900262	901003	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
916889	918430	Do you want to talk about tournament while I call Matt?
918630	921533	There's nothing going on at all.
921793	923094	It's just dead.
923254	925276	It's been like this for like the last three months.
925896	927498	Nothing is happening.
927738	929119	Well, March Madness isn't for two weeks.
929199	932722	Yeah, I mean, we can talk about that next week because nothing's going to happen next week anyways.
934423	934783	One ringy dingy?
934823	935644	It's sad.
935764	936505	Nothing is happening.
936525	937846	Shit, it went out.
937866	938847	My phone sucks in here.
939407	940328	Mine got three bars.
941249	942009	You call Matt then.
942470	942750	No.
943610	944371	You can use my phone.
944891	945152	Okay.
946334	947395	Rob's gonna use my phone.
948116	949578	I'm gonna use the phone.
949979	950419	Here you go.
950800	954324	What else is new in your sim this week, Matt, that we were all playing on last night?
955385	957548	Uh, just more stuff I downloaded.
957608	960812	I mean, I've been trying to work on it, and...
964256	966658	I've got up through 5th Mix all ready to go.
967439	969481	It's ready for Monday.
969521	970762	I'll probably upload this Monday.
971222	972023	Up through 5th Mix.
972043	974245	Pretty much everything you see in Bomani style right now.
976267	979330	I'm trying to get Max and Max 2 done before tonight.
979891	982013	Have those up and maybe some of everything else.
983514	1012253	Yeah, I ran into some problems with the DDR Extreme files because not just one person's making them, but actually a whole bunch of different people are making them, and they're all out of sync, or just awful, and so I have to, like, you know, fix those too, and that sucks, and I don't really want to, and I probably won't, but yeah, there'll be more stuff, and you know what, I don't have, like, no, I don't have a hidden page this week because I'm lazy, and I just didn't get around to it, and you know what, I don't care.
1014274	1024956	and uh, oh shit man, I mean, well, oh, let's go to make, let's make a hidden page one sim file or uh, I don't know, I'll release like 300 tomorrow.
1025436	1027096	Yeah, decisions.
1027896	1029457	So you can have the one or the 300.
1030297	1030397	One.
1032817	1036278	Fine, that's all I'm, you know what sim file I'm gonna upload then?
1036618	1037798	Let them move and that's it.
1037878	1038378	Yay.
1038518	1040039	Just to be the single sim file.
1040519	1042559	Now, I don't know, I've got more stuff.
1043900	1044160	All right.
1046462	1048183	Gosh, what else has been going on this week?
1048904	1052907	Loki and I are planning a move, and we decided on the apartment we want to go to.
1053527	1054988	So the show's going to be moving.
1056689	1059071	Yes, we have an orgasming fountain at the new complex.
1059091	1059952	Multiple orgasming.
1060012	1061993	Yeah, it's like a multiple orgasm fountain.
1062053	1066456	It flickers a little bit of water, then all of a sudden it's like, gush, gush, gush, and then back to a little bit.
1069258	1070039	I lost my job.
1073367	1090938	Fuck Sierra Pacific Mortgage, there are 11,000 Olsen Drive, Rancho Cordova, California, Suite 202 Go there with a grenade launcher, aimed at the office of the shipping department Why did you lose your job?
1091619	1094461	I don't know, they never told me, it's a temp assignment
1095510	1100614	I think because I was being paid more than the other temps because I'm cooler than they are.
1101355	1102636	So, like, we don't want to pay her.
1103016	1104597	She costs too much money and she's too damn good.
1108780	1109521	Anything else you want to say?
1109541	1112103	Well, I guess we can save the rest for the FUs of the week, which we'll do later.
1112523	1112943	Oh, no.
1113084	1114084	I'm going to say it right now.
1114164	1114365	What?
1114685	1118288	Fuck them, fuck them, fuck them, fuck them, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
1119472	1119773	Anymore?
1120894	1122476	Alright.
1122657	1125000	Question for Loki, I guess.
1125140	1127143	What is this about Dancing Stage Megamix?
1127583	1127864	True?
1130187	1131268	I think that's a question for you.
1131969	1132210	Fuck?
1132470	1133732	Dancing Stage Megamix?
1134272	1134993	I've never heard of it.
1135033	1135975	The hell are you talking about?
1138169	1138629	Let's see.
1138749	1141331	I've never heard of what you're talking about here.
1141511	1142852	There's a link, I think.
1142952	1143332	I don't know.
1143432	1144993	I don't know what the hell they're talking about.
1145013	1145533	This is it.
1145553	1145813	Here we go.
1152421	1156685	Konami is in fact hard at work with a new dancing stage game, and this time it's for the PS2.
1157025	1160608	They have licensed new songs for it, and the date is set to a May release in Europe.
1161269	1163010	There are ten licensed songs in the mix.
1163050	1164151	Some of them are as follows.
1164671	1164892	Ms.
1164932	1170697	Dynamite, It Takes More, Elvis, A Little Less Conversation, Kylie Minogue, Love at First Sight,
1171417	1176985	The Sugar Babes, Freak Like Me, Christina Milian, When You Look At Me, The Cure, Love Cats.
1177846	1178466	That's crazy.
1179107	1182892	It'll also feature 20 original tracks created by the Konami development team.
1182952	1186357	It will also have the normal features like Arcade Mode, Practice Mode, and Workout Mode.
1186697	1188520	It'll also feature a tutorial mode for beginners.
1189432	1197614	Once again, I've been saying this before, you know, it really sucks that Euromix stuff gets better music than our fucking US mixes.
1198034	1208216	I mean, let's see, they started putting licensed tracks, you know, in our first one, but ever since the get-go for Dancing Stage, they've had licensed tracks that are exclusive to them, and I think that sucks ass.
1208816	1213357	But, yeah, the one day I'm not on the internet, there's stuff happening.
1213737	1214297	I hate that.
1214457	1217018	It's like I'm on the internet all the fucking time.
1217558	1220040	All day long on the fucking internet.
1220220	1222162	Waiting for something to happen.
1222782	1223803	Nothing ever happens.
1224083	1226044	Then I turn it off, boom, something happens.
1226605	1227025	I hate that.
1228346	1228986	Let's see, what else?
1229887	1233009	We're just leeching news right now from DDRmaniaX.net.
1233210	1235071	Oh yeah, DDR, big brother.
1235411	1237593	Giving a little credit where credit's due.
1237613	1239014	You have a suggestion, Jamie?
1240177	1241860	I have their address.
1243042	1243923	That's what I should do.
1244164	1244404	What?
1244965	1245326	Never mind.
1245366	1247409	I was thinking of ways of getting revenge against that woman.
1247509	1249493	Oh, Jamie's plotting revenge on her work.
1251687	1252448	The former work.
1254149	1259214	Also, DDR Mania X is reporting, and this is kind of neat, DDR was on Big Brother.
1259915	1260775	Oh, Dancing Stage.
1261176	1262777	I'm sorry, Dancing Stage was on Big Brother.
1263238	1266821	Not Big Brother in the U.S., but Big Brother, because Big Brother in the U.S.
1266861	1270184	only airs in the summer, but it was on Big Brother in Norway.
1272136	1284905	They had their very own dancing stage machine and they have this little picture here when they're all playing on the machine and one chick in the back says, fuck the machine, I'm going to play on the Nordic track.
1285145	1285785	That's what she's doing.
1285805	1289508	And then there's this bald guy looking on going, her?
1290328	1291029	What are they doing?
1291269	1302457	And then there's these two chicks kind of dancing and it's obvious that they're... You can always tell a beginner in DDR because they have their hands to their side and they do the total dance that they do in the beginner screen.
1302477	1304598	If you watch that guy in the beginner screen, they do the total dance.
1304618	1307360	They have their hands to the side and they step right, right.
1308721	1311043	Yeah, they're just totally... What do you mean because they're PA-ing?
1311303	1312284	People look like they're P.A.ing.
1312304	1314747	They've got their hands on their side and they're like stomping to the beat.
1314767	1316530	Okay, but even like people who P.A.
1316590	1318752	kind of like move their hands at least a little bit.
1318792	1324720	They don't look like freaking army sergeants standing there going, They don't do the river dance, in other words.
1326604	1328405	Yeah, they're river dancing, that's what they're doing.
1328685	1332607	People who've played DDR for like at least three days don't river dance anymore.
1334608	1334948	Who knows?
1334988	1336229	They have no emotion.
1337229	1339330	We're also hearing that DDR was on MTV.
1339450	1343012	I don't know if anybody saw this, but I guess it was Friday or Saturday night.
1343492	1345994	They had True Life, I'm a Gamer.
1346654	1348175	Something was on TV Friday or Saturday.
1348195	1351897	It was supposed to be this special all about hardcore gamers.
1352817	1357600	I didn't watch it because I knew it would suck, and then coming onto message boards today, guess what?
1357780	1358180	It sucked.
1360041	1360521	Shock?
1361022	1362622	MTV programming sucks?
1363383	1363963	Wow.
1364043	1364904	Shock of shocks.
1365084	1365784	Oh my god.
1367105	1367945	When did that happen?
1368126	1368526	Who knows?
1368826	1373689	And knowing MTV, don't worry if you didn't see it, they'll rerun it 50 times.
1374309	1376130	So just, you know, look in your TV guide.
1376350	1379292	The downfall of MTV began with the banishment of Martha Quinn.
1380212	1380893	Okay, whatever.
1381133	1382054	What the hell is that?
1382074	1383636	The loss of Kennedy, I concur.
1383916	1385718	They have one show that they show.
1386378	1388421	It's like these three sets of people.
1388821	1390543	It's what they do on one Saturday night.
1390623	1394366	It's like you're riding with teenagers as they do nothing.
1396008	1397630	That's because people run out of ideas.
1397730	1403576	It's like, don't live your own life right now, however pathetic it might be, but watch someone else live their pathetic life.
1405376	1407318	I don't give a shit about how other people live their lives.
1407338	1411621	And we're not talking about, like, road rules where they go and do really cool shit like, you know, skydiving and all that stuff.
1411641	1413663	We're talking about average teenagers.
1413723	1415224	You know what sucks about road rules, though?
1416045	1416605	It's old.
1416785	1417586	It's fucking old.
1417766	1419748	They do the same thing every year.
1420148	1422009	Same shit, new location.
1422330	1427734	There's some fag, there's some bitch, there's some black guy, and they all fight all the time.
1427794	1428555	That's what they do.
1428855	1429876	This show's getting old.
1430256	1432257	And then there's the one person who goes, okay.
1432657	1439301	Yeah, and then there's the virgin, the chick that's like, oh, I'm a Mormon, and I'm never going to do anything bad.
1439561	1442882	And then she gets fucked three ways from yesterday before the series is over.
1442902	1444563	I still want to be on the real world.
1444823	1445864	I want to be on the real world.
1445984	1447164	You should be on the real world.
1447285	1450626	See, I wouldn't start fights with anyone, but I'd just be totally strange.
1450746	1451807	I'd just be the weird guy.
1452087	1455329	The guy that sits in the corner like, dude, that guy's weird, man.
1456329	1457990	I don't know what it is, but it's weird.
1458010	1460492	Like, they come to talk to me, and you just, like, start screaming.
1460852	1462193	You know, weird shit like that.
1462354	1466356	Anybody that listens to this show knows that you'd be the crazy racist and homophobe.
1467177	1469319	I'm not the crazy racist homophobe guy.
1469339	1470519	Fuckin' A, man.
1471440	1473061	Hello, man, I'm gonna be living with you.
1473902	1474482	Shit, man.
1474542	1476644	That's why they have auditions for these shows.
1477505	1482628	See, if I were on any of these programs, I would be sitting in the back of my Game Boy.
1484292	1485334	We should do something, though.
1485374	1487317	We should do our own, like, reality show.
1488538	1489960	Orange Lounge Reality Radio.
1491843	1494747	This kind of is reality radio, because it's not like we talk about Mamadi ever.
1496044	1503806	No, I mean, like, we should, you know, get a video camera and go on, like, a weekend road trip or something and videotape it and post it on the internet.
1504606	1505966	This is what we do.
1505986	1510867	This is the thing is I tried to do that for Cyber Beat and it came out really, really bad.
1510987	1511927	Did you have a video camera?
1511967	1513148	I don't even think it ever aired.
1513928	1515128	No, I didn't have a video camera.
1515628	1517329	We could get a video camera and go.
1518029	1518909	I'll do that for Agent 3.
1521799	1522639	Yeah.
1522659	1524641	Girls Gone Wild E3 Edition.
1525121	1531486	Okay, I don't know if we should say anything, but there's a chance that we might have a hookup with E3.
1531806	1532767	But we don't know yet.
1532867	1533367	We don't know yet.
1533567	1535329	We definitely have the hookup with B3.
1535669	1536830	We don't know about E3.
1537610	1537991	Maybe.
1538511	1542934	And if this happens, if this happens, I'm going to put out for these tickets.
1544235	1544816	Seriously.
1545176	1545996	I'm so excited.
1546096	1546577	So we'll see.
1547998	1548359	DarkSakura.com
1563900	1571645	If that happens, we will do an E3 reality show, but we're still kind of hanging off to see if it's going to happen or not.
1571705	1572406	I mean, I don't know.
1572486	1575027	It sounds hopeful, but I'm kind of like, I don't know.
1575528	1580951	But we might have an end, and it's very exciting, so I'm moist with anticipation, as should all of you, because E3 rules.
1581992	1584253	Okay, why are you messing with my shoes?
1584273	1584514	You're like...
1586229	1586489	Anyway.
1587630	1589071	So yeah, DDR on Big Brother.
1589132	1590873	So I think you should try out for Big Brother.
1590973	1593395	I want to try out for Big Brother, because I think I'd be awesome on the show.
1593955	1595357	I'd fucking win Big Brother.
1597018	1601682	Big Brother is the one where they have no computers, no news, no TVs or nothing.
1602022	1607286	They're just in a house with cameras watching them 24 hours a day, and they just all have to coexist.
1609208	1610269	They don't let you bring books.
1616104	1617988	So... I'll bring a book somehow.
1618028	1619811	I'll write a book.
1620171	1621454	Sneak a book in your bra.
1622195	1622756	I'll write a book.
1623117	1624940	I draw the arrows on the ground.
1625040	1626402	What are you doing, man?
1628295	1630576	And what's funny about Big Brother, at least in the U.S.
1630656	1634256	anyway, Big Brother in the U.S., the first season, was shit.
1634336	1637737	It was absolute shit because it was totally not cast well at all.
1637757	1638797	Did they make them do anything?
1639277	1641658	Yeah, they have to do stupid little challenges every week.
1641678	1645879	But in the first season, some of their challenges was having to make paper mache.
1646419	1648099	It was shit.
1648439	1650280	But then the second season, it started to get a little better.
1650300	1653681	I didn't watch the second season because the first season was so bad, I wouldn't watch the second season.
1653921	1655221	But I heard that's what started getting better.
1655461	1657361	And then this last season was really good.
1657642	1658382	Last season was good.
1658862	1661642	Like, they finally got some... You're a bitch!
1661963	1664263	You made Pippi Longstocking out of my shoes!
1666083	1668184	Anyway, yeah, the last season of Big Brother was pretty good.
1668304	1681307	And I could totally see them doing something like this, where they bring in... Then that's what they do, is they just kind of drop a toy on them, like, and then in the next week, they would probably have to do, like, whoever's the best at DDR gets to win, gets to go out for dinner.
1681707	1682728	Oh man, I would love that.
1682988	1686250	It's like they do the same thing for that show and you're on the show.
1686330	1689091	Dude, and see, I would... They're playing it and they're like, okay, who's the best of all?
1689472	1690932	Start busting up.
1691233	1693414	Oh my god, just don't even try.
1693434	1694454	See, you know, I'd fake it.
1694535	1697436	Like for that whole week, I'd fake it that I really suck at DDR.
1697796	1704360	And then like the last day of it, I'd just go fucking nuts and win the dinner and everybody would hate me and I'd get voted out.
1704400	1707402	It just suddenly dawned on me as you're there, you know, PA-ing back.
1707442	1709243	Yeah, just like, it just clicked.
1709383	1710003	I don't know.
1711244	1713047	Oh my god, it's not like I don't play this.
1713447	1713908	Oh.
1714649	1715870	Yay, Jamie's going to fix my shoes.
1719269	1722992	I have some more really important Bomani news, or Bomani-related news.
1723052	1726174	It's not really directly Bomani news, but it's about a Bomani artist.
1726655	1728996	I have some really important Bomani news that we need to take care of.
1729637	1733440	And it's about a lady who was in Max 2.
1734360	1735801	And you probably know this song.
1736242	1738944	She's Ginger Spice, and she did a song called It's Rainin' Men.
1739844	1740665	You all know that song.
1741426	1743127	She's not a Spice girl, but she used to be.
1743880	1747322	But there was big revelations about Jerry Halliwell this week.
1748303	1749704	And this is the way the story goes.
1750204	1753966	Ex-Spice Girl Jerry admits she had a lesbian fling.
1755547	1756128	Uh-oh.
1757549	1763472	So former Spice Girl Jerry Halliwell says she has had a brief encounter with another woman but denies she's a lesbian.
1764533	1766274	So she's not joining Tattoo or anything.
1766294	1767755	Remember, try it but don't like it.
1769028	1776094	The singer, who has dated fellow pop star Robbie Williams, told Thursday's Sun tabloid that after the fling, she quickly realized that she was not gay.
1776614	1781698	I had a little lesbian thing, she said, adding the encounter with an unnamed woman had been part of experimenting.
1782499	1786702	She refused to pinpoint the date, but said it was somewhere between the ages of 16 and 30.
1788884	1791085	Yeah, it's somewhere between now and never.
1793167	1794588	It was just a drunken moment.
1796387	1798989	You wanna go home and have sex with me?
1799629	1800549	Sure!
1800689	1801930	Wanna touch my cooter?
1801950	1805772	And a man.
1817967	1828158	Hallowell, or Ginger Spice, as she was known during her time with the band, left the Spice Girls in 98 amid reports of bitter squabbling.
1830201	1832383	The 30-year-old singer is currently hosting the U.S.
1832423	1834606	television beauty and talent show All-American Girl.
1835366	1839251	Which, by the way, funny enough, All-American Girl was the name of Margaret Cho's show.
1840060	1841561	Much, much different program.
1841882	1842903	Also on ABC.
1843383	1845425	Can you believe they blatantly just took that name?
1846245	1850069	Especially after Margaret Cho's movie about the hell she went through on that show.
1850089	1850989	Well, you know what's funny?
1851590	1856714	They're having Howard Stern is actually, you know that show, Are You Hot?
1857015	1857215	Yes.
1857695	1861258	He's suing the producers of that show because it was his idea.
1861278	1861879	Because...
1862980	1873467	If you go to smokinggun.com, which is like my favorite website on the entire internet, you can read the court documents of Howard Stern filing the lawsuit with ABC.
1873507	1879152	Because apparently, he used to do this bit on his show, and it's been a long time since I've listened to Howard Stern in it.
1879712	1880533	I never even saw it.
1880573	1881353	I used to watch the E!
1881393	1883875	show and I used to listen to it in the morning, but I never saw this segment.
1884336	1885476	But I guess it's been on for a while.
1885536	1888098	It was the Examiners, what was it called?
1888158	1888338	The...
1890641	1892724	I don't know, but they would have... I think it was called the same thing, actually.
1892764	1893806	No, it wasn't called Are You Hot?
1893826	1894506	It had something else.
1895247	1898472	Still, I even thought that they were ripping that off of that website, Are You Hot or Not?
1898552	1898672	Yeah.
1898692	1899213	They sued him, too.
1902082	1902622	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1923813	1924134	I don't know.
1924374	1927076	Well, they have Lorenzo Llamas as a judge.
1927176	1927636	Oh, him.
1927677	1928077	Never mind.
1928157	1930239	I'm getting Eric Estrada mixed up with Lorenzo Llamas.
1930699	1931700	I don't know how or why, but I did.
1931720	1933501	He's like, yeah, I don't like women with fake breasts.
1935783	1936324	Wait, hold on.
1936344	1938646	Let's flash back for a second here.
1938686	1944270	Didn't you just... Weren't you dating or, say, married to a Playboy model?
1945572	1947433	You know, just to fill you in.
1947453	1947853	Guess what?
1948254	1949235	They weren't real.
1951400	1952000	Fake breasts.
1952721	1955362	Breasts aren't supposed to be like solid plastic.
1955942	1962605	I mean, when she hits the wall, they're supposed to kind of like give a little bit, not like crush through them.
1962685	1964265	It's a surgical flotation device.
1965806	1966626	It's a bath toy.
1967587	1973589	In case of water landing, the bosom may be used as a flotation device.
1974149	1978311	So this begs the topic that we need to do a new segment here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1979853	1982794	I don't wanna see that shit unless you really are hot.
2002097	2007420	Only if you're really, really hot, and like people tell you that on a daily basis, then nude photos are okay.
2007701	2010763	But if you don't get told that every day, don't send it.
2011263	2017127	So you're just going to send it to OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com, and we'll let you know how you rank, okay?
2017307	2020349	And Howard Stern can sue us if he wants, but you know, you can't get blood out of a turnip.
2021009	2025752	So, send your photos, graphs of you playing DDR, and we'll let you know if you're hot or not.
2026032	2027433	And what we'll do... Huh?
2028414	2028554	See...
2032546	2036509	And remember that all pictures submitted become the property of Orange Lounge Radio.
2036549	2038971	We say that because we're going to put your pictures on our website.
2039272	2043515	Because this is radio, obviously, other people are going to need to see these somehow.
2043575	2046858	So we're going to put your pictures up on the site so that people can access them.
2048119	2048699	Brilliant, huh?
2050361	2050821	Yeah.
2052002	2053823	And Jamie says if you... No.
2057209	2061774	It reminds us of an old segment from Under Sedation Live, the kind of show that came before this.
2061794	2063896	Has anybody ever listened to Under Sedation Live?
2064316	2065718	You need to listen or we'll shoot you.
2066418	2068921	There was an old segment that also included pictures submitting.
2069762	2070883	Oh, excellent question.
2070903	2074466	EOSFEB asks, what if he whips his cock out at the end of the routine?
2074967	2075587	Good question.
2075767	2076548	You want to know what?
2077069	2077229	What?
2078815	2087920	No offense to any of our guys listening, but I think that as far as organs go, that the penis is the weirdest looking thing ever.
2088240	2088961	Why do you think that?
2089081	2089901	They just are ugly.
2091162	2092883	Just because they're just like there?
2092903	2095184	I don't want someone to whip out their cock on film.
2095204	2095625	I'm sorry.
2097567	2104538	Well, what if somebody whipped out their cock and in an amazing yaoi fetish film another guy started sucking it?
2104558	2105138	Would that be okay?
2105479	2105679	Okay.
2106200	2106861	Okay, much better.
2107622	2109745	So, you hypocrite!
2112589	2112910	Alright.
2116707	2122368	If you want... Okay, so send those pictures to OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com.
2122388	2123528	They have to be of you playing DDR.
2123828	2126629	And no nudes unless you're told that you're hot every single day.
2127289	2128249	And you have to have proof.
2128289	2129670	Somebody has to send us an affidavit.
2131490	2132490	I am not retarded.
2132550	2137291	I think that it's the strangest looking... I didn't say I didn't like cock.
2138691	2140092	It's just funny looking.
2141352	2142132	I can just see it now.
2143052	2144994	You know, that's really weird looking.
2145194	2145994	Oh yeah, thanks.
2146415	2147756	Whoa, that does it for me.
2148916	2150998	Oh come on, even Dan agrees with me.
2153220	2154281	It's like Carrot Top.
2155041	2157283	He's funny looking, but everybody loves Carrot Top.
2157323	2158584	No wait, nobody loves Carrot Top.
2159004	2160105	How about Yahoo Serious?
2161446	2162787	Yahoo Serious, funny looking.
2163307	2164628	But everybody loves Yahoo Serious.
2164648	2166050	We like him because he's Australian.
2166210	2166670	That's true.
2166710	2166950	He's funny.
2167671	2169152	He plays with the Tasmanian Devils.
2169993	2170113	Ah.
2170193	2171374	Funny Australian stuff.
2173387	2175168	What if you tell yourself you're hot every day?
2198651	2200291	So, moving along.
2201392	2202292	What else do we have to talk about?
2204053	2206794	Um, I don't know.
2206894	2208054	I'm just not happy today.
2208334	2209115	You're just not happy today?
2209435	2209595	What?
2209635	2210075	What's up, Loki?
2211287	2212808	Ah, there's microphones coming in from which way?
2213508	2221171	Well, actually, in two weeks, we're probably going to see the last, I think, of the DDR Extreme Unlocks.
2222272	2222572	I think.
2222812	2223693	I can't remember offhand.
2223873	2230395	I think there's 30, well, number-wise, as far as the Unlocks go, there's a total of 30 different Unlocks.
2231916	2255755	I mean even though like number 30 is like three different songs or three different whatever but there's only like 30 total and we're up to 24 right now so in two weeks we're gonna have the rest of the songs supposedly so which ought to make it very interesting because in two weeks from now is March Madness yes March Madness so I wonder if we're gonna see any like last minute routines to some of these new songs
2257338	2260739	March Madness will be broadcasting live, by the way, on Orange Lounge Radio.
2260779	2273304	For those of you not in NorCal or SoCal, driving up here or whatever, if you're too far away to come to the tournament in person, you can attend online and just visit our website, and we'll be doing a live broadcast all day long, both days.
2273664	2280266	So that does mean in two weeks, the normal live program here on Orange Lounge will be preempted by that coverage, so we won't be on live.
2280606	2286108	and chances are we're actually going to finish up over there probably around 7 o'clock so there won't be a show in two weeks.
2286248	2287549	But we'll be here next week, of course.
2289670	2290030	Yeah.
2290930	2293971	If anyone expects me to do a fuck-off afterwards, you can fuck off.
2293991	2295432	Because I'm going to be dead.
2297913	2301914	Had a tournament here last night, says NinjaOsakeKoi.
2302795	2303455	It was interesting.
2305211	2305852	Where was that tournament?
2305872	2308135	Was that the tournament in Albany, by chance?
2308155	2312281	Because I know there was a big one that was supposed to go on the East Coast yesterday, and I haven't heard anything about that.
2312701	2313642	I'm wondering how it went.
2313662	2318669	If somebody wants to tell me about how that went, certainly, I'll fill you all in on that.
2318749	2321593	Oh, this particular tournament was in Hickory, North Carolina.
2322714	2323094	Cool.
2324475	2346752	You know, if any of you folks out there on the East Coast, other places, Mid Coast, basically anywhere outside of California, you want to do some tournament coverage, you want to maybe take a tape recorder over and talk to some people there, talk to the winners, talk about the tournament, put together a little bit like 10 minutes long little package about the tournament, we'll air it here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2346792	2351796	We put a call out a while back on LiveJournal, but nobody sent us anything, so fuck them.
2357166	2357686	Let's see.
2359486	2360046	Suggestion.
2360086	2366768	We should do a March Madness tournament of DDR songs or something sort of like NCAA basketball brackets with voting to win.
2367989	2370889	That kind of reminds me of what GameFacts.com did a while back.
2371189	2372810	Oh, that was suggested by Brack2000, by the way.
2374150	2380332	That kind of reminds me, were any of you watching GameFacts.com a while back when they did that top video game character of all time?
2383087	2386431	GameFacts.com was back in April when they had Xbox.com.
2387192	2388153	XboxFacts.com.
2388333	2389795	Oh, the April Fool's joke?
2390375	2392718	I think right after that.
2392758	2398224	It was during the summer they did the top 64 characters of all time.
2401073	2401913	Know what I don't like?
2402614	2404494	Is this new show on TechTV.
2404674	2407756	It's like this Microsoft-only show.
2407776	2409856	It's like all Microsoft propaganda.
2411157	2412097	Stupid Nazis.
2412998	2413478	What is it about?
2413498	2414158	I've never seen this.
2414438	2419700	It's like extra tips for Microsoft products and Microsoft this and Microsoft that.
2420400	2427683	And it's all about Microsoft and how wonderful Microsoft is and how Microsoft, you know, heals the world and whatnot.
2427943	2429344	And it sucks ass.
2430339	2434720	Remember that parody they put out by the Micro Shaft Corporation, Wimblows?
2435881	2436761	Yeah.
2439262	2439802	They suck.
2441502	2447064	Okay, I think what we're going to do, we're going to go to a quick break, then we're going to come back and get to the FUs of the week.
2447844	2450825	And it'll definitely be short this week because there's only three of us here in studio.
2451145	2452885	There's lots of you.
2453125	2458267	Yeah, but there's lots of you, so you can go ahead and send those FUs over to Sky via private message in the channel.
2460184	2461365	Let's see.
2461645	2462866	We have another hot or not question.
2463306	2466088	I only have a video of me playing Legend of Max.
2466128	2467088	Is that acceptable?
2467188	2467468	Sure.
2467748	2469730	Sure, but please don't email that.
2469770	2474612	If you could put that on the web somewhere and give us a link and email us the link, that would be great.
2474692	2475153	Don't send us...
2476287	2479691	or there's programs out there that take screencaps of videos.
2479751	2482514	They'll cut a frame right out of it and you can use that too.
2483535	2494066	Yeah, so please don't email us video, but email us like a link to the video or take a screencap of it because we don't want any files over like 200k or something or else our email box will fill up too damn quick.
2495543	2495803	All right.
2496704	2497784	What do we want to hear this break?
2497864	2498445	What do you guys think?
2498765	2499145	Entrance.
2499686	2499886	Entrance.
2499906	2501447	Didn't we already... No, we didn't do Entrance.
2501487	2503888	Entrance is the one you said I should have played that we didn't do.
2504628	2504949	Okay.
2508451	2509411	Heaven is a Metallic 57 Grey?
2509431	2510852	I don't even know if I can find that one.
2510872	2511593	I'll see if I can find it.
2512433	2512753	All right.
2514034	2515095	Uh, Entrance, Entrance, Entrance.
2515135	2516336	I don't have Entrance.
2516376	2517596	What style was Entrance on?
2517616	2519918	Entrance first came out in 5th style.
2520938	2522319	Entrance first came out in 5th style.
2528327	2529530	I think someone else might have just showed up.
2529570	2530453	We had the door go.
2530633	2532398	Let's see who opens up the door in a little bit.
2535008	2536149	Kitsushite, thanks.
2868800	2874583	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
2877625	2882207	Hi, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 37.
2882527	2886989	With the amazing... With the guest starring the amazing buzzing noise.
2887069	2889711	We apologize about that, but there's not shit we can do about it right now.
2889751	2890271	We apologize.
2890851	2892872	So we're all going to talk good and loud tonight, yes?
2893493	2894573	Yes, we will.
2894633	2895254	Alright, so...
2896491	2898193	During the break, the room blew up.
2898433	2900295	Like, we doubled in size during the break.
2900355	2903078	So let's say hello to all our tardy folks tonight.
2903118	2903579	That's okay.
2904220	2905281	Intern Zero made it.
2905601	2906923	What, he didn't call in for me?
2907563	2907803	No.
2908464	2910086	We don't have a phone to call into.
2911708	2915312	You know, I actually, according to my call log, I missed like four calls from Matt.
2916832	2917873	I haven't seen a Bjork video.
2917893	2918254	Oh, great.
2918294	2918414	Thanks.
2939116	2940197	Human Behavior, the one with the bear.
2940237	2942839	I saw the one where she's jumping around and just being stupid, though.
2943760	2947444	It's like she's just bouncing off her couch or something like that.
2947464	2949746	I don't remember a Bjork video with a couch in it.
2949806	2950066	I don't know.
2950086	2950426	We'll see.
2950767	2951287	Like I know.
2952637	2956660	Okay, so, also here we have DDRholic, say hello.
2956880	2960142	Hello, good evening everybody, and always fashionably late, here I am.
2960623	2965466	It's alright, we forgive you, because we know there was a lot of partying last night, there was a little bit of partying.
2965506	2967367	No, it was so cool, it was great.
2967527	2968788	How late did the party go, tell?
2968848	2969909	Because we left about 3.30.
2970229	2974152	It probably went until about 4, 4 o'clock.
2976513	2977074	Okay, cool.
2977794	2978735	Yeah.
2978755	2980316	I would have stayed back at work this morning.
2980336	2981317	Yeah, I got cold feet.
2982313	2985157	I got cold because his house has no heating at the time.
2986919	2988401	There is a little story to this.
2989002	2996692	The heater was on last night at like 100 degrees and so I went and turned it down and then I wake up this morning and somebody turned it all the way off.
2998212	3004757	It was comfortable and I turned it down to like 80 and then I wake up and it's just totally off because some stupid moron turned it off.
3005257	3006578	Probably one of the jerks in the back.
3007038	3010741	Yeah, because it doesn't help that the heater is in the back of the house and there's none in the front.
3011382	3017666	And you know when you're at a party, you know when you're at a real party when like all these people are showing up that you don't fucking know.
3018206	3019547	That was happening last night.
3020028	3024831	All these people were showing up and what's even weirder, they know you but you don't know them.
3025171	3025772	Oh, that's weird.
3027225	3028466	I took a nap, sorry.
3029226	3030207	Oh, no problem.
3030447	3032809	I think most everybody took a nap at some point.
3032849	3033890	I took like a three hour nap.
3035591	3041695	I like took over that love seat and didn't move for a while except like to wake up every so often.
3041976	3045118	And when I woke up I'd be fully awake and then I'd be silly tired again.
3046638	3059368	Well, like, okay, it was kind of retarded at the end because all the kids in the back were screaming and being dumb and coming over and taking the couch so none of the adults had places to sit.
3059428	3062870	Like, Shane slept on the damn couch after you left so nobody could sit there.
3063511	3067134	And then Loki had his spot and I had my couch and that was it.
3067454	3069976	And they were still yelling at 5 o'clock in the morning.
3072403	3073385	Those damn kids!
3075169	3079136	And then that was funny, that call the proceeds of the party from that stupid bitch.
3082034	3085877	This is like the best thing, which is actually pretty funny that Loki bitched it.
3086497	3093042	Okay, Matt and Loki are at my house, we're setting up Loki's pads for a sim, and this girl calls.
3093342	3096364	I won't say her name, but she knows who she is because I know she's listening right now.
3098305	3103048	She calls, and she's just trying to lay these guilt trips on me, and I'm like, I want to get off the phone right now.
3103809	3105930	And she's all, no, I don't want to let you.
3105970	3110133	Then she tells me about how some truck drove by her and threw porn at her or something.
3110153	3110633	Okay.
3111555	3112698	That's a bad thing?
3113923	3115107	I want someone to throw porn at me.
3117239	3125041	And then so I'm like, okay, and then she's like starting to get mad at me, so I just flat call her a bitch on the phone like four times, and they're over there laughing.
3125061	3126362	Language, now now.
3126462	3128703	I'm sorry.
3128723	3129003	Bitch!
3129383	3129723	Thank you.
3130143	3137605	Anyways, so they're over there laughing, and I'm trying not to laugh, and then she's, and I'm like, I just want to go, so you get annoyed with me.
3137645	3140366	I said, I want to go because I'm about to have a party, and I need to get ready for it.
3140386	3141987	She's like, you can hang up anytime.
3142647	3143627	And I said, oh, I can?
3143687	3144468	And I just hung the phone up.
3148519	3149500	That sounds worthy of me.
3150040	3153502	That's interesting because it's like really mean yet kind of humorous at the same time.
3153963	3154263	I don't know.
3154703	3159406	Also here, hiding in the corner, snacking on food, eating a lot and getting really fat.
3160207	3162028	Eating a lot, getting really fat, of course.
3162248	3165070	Well, I have some catching up to do with that.
3166111	3168472	Say hello to the ice queen, cold as always.
3168652	3169233	That's right.
3169853	3171334	Or I should say frigid as always.
3171614	3172154	Well, that too.
3173415	3179497	Of course, you know, it's odd though because I don't really seem to remember much about last night except getting home at like 5 o'clock in the morning.
3180497	3181057	Go figure that.
3184178	3185799	He picked up a prostitute on the way home.
3188640	3191301	I was very interested in driving while I was asleep.
3196883	3205948	So, we're going to catch you guys up on what you missed so far.
3205988	3209509	There's not a whole lot of Imani news this week, so we don't have a lot to talk about, surprise, surprise.
3209529	3219094	However, it did come out in the news that Jerry Halliwell, who did It's Rainin' Men from 7th Max 2, admitted she had a lesbian fling.
3221515	3226319	and the ever important Dancing Sage Megamix coming out for the PS2.
3226619	3227040	Get this.
3228341	3228801	The Cure.
3229782	3234226	The Cure is going to be it and they're going to have a little less conversation in that remix of the Elvis song.
3238049	3240371	That's alright because you know what everyone's going to do.
3240391	3243313	They're just going to rip the songs and make sim files for it.
3244354	3245055	And you won't buy it.
3246176	3248598	Well, and you won't buy it if you're in the US.
3248818	3257265	Because, you know, importing those is a little harder because they're in PAL and, you know, it doesn't work too well and you have to have a modded PS2.
3257305	3261728	Because I know everyone out there is just going to rush to get a European PS2.
3262869	3263690	Not me, I'm lazy.
3264375	3265015	Oh, fuck that.
3265175	3269236	No, I'll import Japanese games, but European stuff could... Yeah.
3269977	3270297	Whatever.
3270317	3272497	I'll wait for someone to rip it.
3272517	3274398	Yeah.
3276218	3276518	Alright.
3276638	3279279	Joe, by the way, we have to offer a word to our sponsors.
3279399	3279639	Sure.
3280079	3282860	This episode of Orange Jones Radio is brought to you by Propel.
3284093	3293561	by Pizzeria Pretzel Combos and the El Cerroso Guata Chip, guacamole chips.
3293701	3296504	They're tortilla chips with guacamole already in them.
3296524	3297985	They're chips that are the color of boogers.
3298894	3301275	For those of you... What did you say, Loki?
3301315	3304277	Loki made a funny... It's the guacamole belt chip.
3304697	3305217	Ha ha ha.
3305517	3308559	For those of you too lazy to dip your chips, that's amazing.
3308639	3309359	Only in America.
3310800	3312361	We will play Gamma London a couple in a little while.
3312761	3313061	Alright.
3314622	3315522	Let's do the FUs of the week.
3315542	3316003	You guys ready?
3317483	3318704	Alright, we got a whole bunch.
3318804	3319865	Chatroom sent me a whole bunch.
3320885	3323446	So, plenty of things to rant about tonight.
3323546	3324527	Let's get it started.
3332028	3333269	This is fucked up.
3334849	3337130	My first fuck you of the week is for what I mentioned earlier.
3337150	3338591	It's what's here at Pacifica Mortgage.
3338711	3342152	And in particular, Shanda, who was the supervisor.
3342192	3344153	Her name is Shanda Ramsey-Wallace, and I don't care.
3344573	3345514	I'm not a professional.
3346854	3348195	She can go burn in hell.
3349195	3351256	Because I had been asking for feedback.
3351296	3352116	How am I doing?
3352456	3353757	What do you need me to do differently?
3354377	3356158	What can I do to improve what I'm doing?
3356858	3358459	She's like, oh no, you're doing fine.
3358499	3359999	No, no, no, no, no.
3360039	3360940	Just like that, by the way.
3362083	3365625	and then I get a call at 9 a.m.
3365685	3368706	today saying that I lost my assignment with my job.
3369627	3371308	Now I'm going through 10 pages because of, you know.
3372268	3378071	And the other thing about this, I need to go to the doctor really bad and I've needed to go for practically a year now.
3379432	3387196	And I was really, you know, counting on being made permanent this week so that I could go to the doctor and get all that crap taken care of.
3387636	3388076	But no.
3388857	3389017	So...
3390163	3398449	You know, I have to say this, is that what I'm going to do when I finally find out what's wrong is I'm going to send her my medical reports and I'm going to say, look, bitch, you can pay for half of this.
3399230	3403232	I should probably sue her for, you know, for damages.
3403753	3406074	And, you know, with our current court system, I'd probably win.
3406955	3409017	But, I'm not that petty.
3409537	3410358	But, no.
3410378	3412159	I like how you add that in there.
3412539	3413520	But, P.S., I'm not that petty.
3414639	3416320	No, I'm not petty and fake like she is.
3417001	3426649	But anyway, her office is toward the front on the opposite side where the UC Davis Medical Center is at 11,000 Olsen Drive in Rancho Cordova.
3427270	3429551	It's upstairs on the right side of the building.
3429952	3432214	And her office is the window office.
3432674	3434676	She can go in there and set it on fire.
3434896	3441822	Although I am technically making a bunch of those very botsy, like the vomit flavor and dirt and sardine on her desk.
3442905	3445066	I am going at 5 in the morning to pick up my stuff.
3445086	3449148	Before she's there, so that I don't have to see her ugly, lying face.
3450048	3450708	But guess what?
3451449	3455250	They said the Tempexie apparently likes me so much they're giving me another 7 instantly.
3455270	3455790	Yay.
3455830	3458571	They're doing Shikibai.
3458591	3458811	Next.
3460652	3463113	Moving on, uh, Loki, what do you have to say?
3463513	3463874	Uh...
3466548	3467729	See, the usual.
3468330	3469691	FU to stupid drivers.
3469711	3471813	I had some dumb bitch in front of me today.
3471913	3478238	Actually, I don't know who it was, but it was some dumb bitch driving a 30 and a 45.
3478498	3480740	And there was no red lights or anything.
3480760	3482702	It's not like you're slowing down or anything.
3482902	3485104	You're just slowing down for the hell of it.
3485124	3488287	So I got pissed and drove by them and flipped them off.
3489515	3493137	and yelled at them and stuff, even though they couldn't hear me, but it felt good.
3493157	3498440	Um, FB the stupid, FB the stupid teenagers that were, uh, at Scandia last night?
3499260	3500101	Um, okay, let's see.
3500641	3502182	Number one, you're a nerd.
3502562	3504263	Okay, yeah, that's acceptable, okay?
3504323	3505944	Number two, you're not goth.
3506934	3511117	Don't try to be... I don't know what the hell they think, but what's the step of coolness?
3511377	3514879	Okay, let's see here, I'm at the bottom rung, so the next thing I gotta be is goth.
3515319	3519662	Oh wait, um, you know, the whole goth trend, you know, that was so ten years ago.
3520842	3522923	And now you're just annoying, and you look stupid.
3522963	3524765	And then the guy with the wannabe mohawk.
3525225	3530448	I'm gonna spike up my hair in the middle, and it's gonna look like shit, and then I'm gonna be all cool.
3530708	3531609	Because I... yeah.
3532580	3540222	So there's all these kids that are like, wanna be punk, which is sad, because it doesn't take much to be punk, but they're not quite there yet.
3540991	3542412	and then they're playing DDR.
3542632	3548357	And you'd think, okay, these wannabe punk guys, maybe they listen to rock, maybe they're, you know, trying to get through the whole punk scene and that kind of thing.
3548657	3553241	They start playing Nori, Nori, Nori, and fucking, like, you know, shit like that.
3553821	3554862	And it makes no sense.
3555222	3558024	I'm just, you're annoying, and you're in my way.
3558044	3561947	So then I had my turn coming up on the machine, because we had a coin line, it was all fucked up.
3561967	3567772	So I had my turn, this dumb, this dumb, dumbass kid comes up to me, he's like, you know, what was my turn?
3568152	3570593	I'm like, fuck you, man, I was waiting for people.
3570733	3572493	I, you know, I counted it and everything.
3572833	3576494	Well, I don't know if I've been on here, waiting here for two minutes or fifteen minutes.
3577594	3580475	I'm like, well, it was my fucking turn.
3580535	3581035	Get out of here.
3581355	3582896	So, it's annoying.
3583616	3586096	So, basically, just stupid people at Scandia, because they suck.
3586116	3586597	F you to...
3593386	3598830	F you, this stupid bastard that was there also last night that wanted to do some improv tourney.
3599091	3601412	He's like, dude, let's have a tourney, man, for people.
3601953	3602433	Yeah!
3603194	3615923	I know that kid, and he used to try to hang out with me because he thought I was so cool because I played DDR, and I was teaching him little stuff, and now he thinks he's like some DDR god who's always trying to get tournament going everywhere he goes, even if he's by himself.
3616004	3617645	He'll ask random people to tourney with him.
3617665	3618706	You're a dumbass, sir.
3619446	3625472	You're just like that stupid cowboy skater guy who didn't know what a syringe was.
3626032	3627974	You're lower than him, okay?
3628975	3631778	Sad, pathetic person, you.
3632118	3634140	Let's see what else we've got on the list here.
3634160	3635741	I know there's a bunch of shit.
3636822	3640086	F you to the police, because I don't know why it takes about eight people to...
3641887	3644569	Thank you for giving out my address on air, I appreciate that.
3644589	3644869	Just kidding.
3658837	3659698	I'm kidding, God.
3660199	3661160	I took a street.
3661180	3663162	What the hell, man?
3664443	3665905	Fucking A, dude, that's stupid.
3666706	3674274	Yeah, so they're just... I don't understand, they're like complaining, we don't have enough money to, you know, support our police force and it's understaffed and...
3675109	3675689	What the fuck?
3675729	3681073	You have like eight people traveling around here, you know, pulling over speeders in a traffic area.
3681393	3684335	You're not going to speed if there's cars in front of you, you dumbasses.
3684836	3689519	Why don't you do something important like stop robberies or drive by punchings or something like that?
3689979	3692621	You know, something like, do something.
3693061	3699866	Okay, um, FD to my website for the FTP being slow and, uh, yeah.
3699886	3703709	That's hostones.com so they can go fuck themselves and, uh,
3705717	3710040	I don't know, that's all I have right now because my memory's kind of going at the moment.
3710360	3713962	I can't think of anything, so I'm sure it'll come.
3713982	3714182	Next.
3714982	3716043	Alright, my turn.
3718844	3720545	My FUs of the week are pretty short.
3721506	3725608	My first FU of the week goes to Loki Sim.
3726048	3728169	Because last night at the party, I didn't get to play it at all.
3728970	3730030	Because I was too drunk.
3731431	3732132	Why is it my Sim's fault?
3732172	3734453	I really wanted to play it too, and I didn't get to.
3735731	3738352	Well, then F everybody else who played, because I didn't get to play.
3738732	3740812	Oh, oh, oh, wait, thank you for reminding me.
3740872	3744453	And I even remember saying in a drunken stupor, I want to play!
3744473	3747373	I have one more, I just remembered.
3747693	3748074	Uh-oh.
3748114	3750954	F you the Cypher gamepads, because they suck ass.
3751494	3760496	Okay, what the hell's the point of putting freaking... They've got, I don't even know what kind of gauge of sheet metal they have underneath it, but there's no fucking way it's going to hold any sort of weight whatsoever.
3760896	3764557	I took the feet off the bottom of these things so they wouldn't bend, and they still fucking bend.
3764797	3764957	They're
3765774	3767835	and the wires started coming out of the fucking arrows.
3767935	3771556	It's like, shit man, I thought my pads were built really shitty.
3771877	3775918	I mean, I look at my pads and I'm like, oh my god, man, I just totally fucked those up.
3776198	3782341	But now these are just really fucked up, so... Yeah, don't buy Cypher game pads if you're gonna buy them online.
3782361	3783701	Buy anyone else's.
3783721	3784702	It's just not theirs.
3787521	3787801	All right.
3788822	3790363	A quick question in the chat room.
3790423	3793966	Wonder what someone would like trying to play DDR when they're really, really drunk.
3794687	3797229	Last time I was in Vegas, I did that at Circus Circus.
3797269	3799711	I got really fucked up at the Star Trek experience.
3801118	3801639	I did that too.
3818960	3822822	I played Afronova Trick on the machine that's right in the middle of like the little kid area.
3823202	3824683	That's like, you know, above the casino.
3824723	3827925	They kind of have like the little kid area where all the kiddies can play arcade games.
3828185	3833288	I played Afronova Trick up there and went promptly back up to the hotel room and threw up in the tub.
3833308	3839091	You know, I realized when I was in Reno and I was at the Atlantis and I played their Max 2 machine.
3839131	3842313	I play better when I'm drunk than when I'm not drunk.
3842913	3846275	I was, uh, I was, it was the DDR Freak Moderator's trip.
3847742	3849963	Me, an iguana girl, and Islander.
3850343	3854285	All three of us and two of my friends were there who lived in Las Vegas.
3855046	3858868	At this Star Trek experience, between the three of us, we had three warp core breaches.
3861309	3862449	And, no, two and a half.
3862469	3863370	Two and a half.
3864350	3865431	And we went on the ride.
3867518	3874228	And then we took a cab over to Circus Circus and played on the USA machine that was up there.
3874789	3877173	With the broken arrows on the right side.
3877193	3878255	And I was trying to do Love to Me.
3881448	3884189	And then, like, we called, um, Understood Nation Live.
3884209	3885629	The voicemail, because we were drunk.
3885889	3888230	And, um, one more F for you, just remember it again.
3888870	3891131	Fuck you to the stupid DDR Extreme Roulette.
3892431	3897533	Seven times yesterday, I got one away from The Legend of Max, and it wouldn't fucking give it to me!
3897973	3901214	I've got the timing down perfect, yet you won't give it to me!
3901694	3904435	Why even fucking have it in the roulette if you're not gonna give it to me?!
3905135	3909677	You stupid assholes, I can't wait two weeks to play the damn song, I wanna play it now!
3911015	3917718	I wouldn't play Roulette so you know I could get Cutie Chaser five times for freaking White Lovers or whatever the fuck that stupid song is.
3918018	3919059	It sucks ass.
3919439	3920459	It shouldn't be in there.
3922120	3923200	Tell us what you really think, Loki.
3924701	3926222	Oh yeah, Cutie Chaser Morning Mix.
3926522	3930104	Why did they take anything from OHA, you know, DDR?
3930204	3931584	It's just dumb.
3931604	3933145	Did you say Omaha DDR?
3933325	3934426	OHA, you dumbass!
3936286	3937146	Not Omaha.
3937466	3939487	I swear to God, I thought you said Omaha.
3939887	3941348	I'm like, hey, we got friends there.
3941768	3945769	Yeah, do you know of a DDR Omaha mix?
3946950	3948870	Do you know of one?
3949751	3955593	That's what I thought you said, and I'm like, in my mind, I'm like, God, Loki's a retard.
3955613	3957033	There's no Omaha mix.
3960394	3962335	Rob's still drunk in his head.
3963435	3964156	Rob's still drunk.
3964416	3965056	I'm taking over.
3966647	3968849	No, Rob's too drunk to be a host.
3969369	3971831	No, I'm not doing my FUs yet, lady.
3978338	3979520	I forgot to finish that story.
3979580	3990150	When you play DDR drunk, it's like, every time you jump, I remember, because Africa of a Trick has that part where you go, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-hey, and you jump really high, you know, that's the cool newbie thing to do.
3990450	3991251	So I was doing that.
3991511	3996476	And, like, I just remember, like, you jump up, and it's like, I'm flying, and then you come down like a rock.
3997477	3998939	That's how it's different when you're drunk.
3998979	3999700	That's all I remember.
4000240	4005805	When I do this, I always spin on them, and I get really dizzy.
4005885	4008988	I played drunk on your old pads.
4009088	4010029	I thought that was funny.
4010469	4012171	I'd also like to give an F you to lack of sex.
4012251	4012531	Thank you.
4012991	4017075	My boy played drunk on my pads, and he fell over, and that was funny.
4017896	4021079	Alright, let's get to the rest of the room, shall we?
4022992	4023552	Who's first?
4023572	4026233	Who else is first?
4026654	4027154	You're first.
4027174	4027234	Go.
4027414	4029255	Okay, um, a couple FUs.
4029355	4033257	One of them is to these guaca chips because they taste like guaca shit.
4034617	4036478	I don't care if anybody else likes them.
4036718	4037999	I think they taste like crap.
4040440	4041800	Combos are fucking good.
4042401	4042821	Eat one.
4043246	4045248	Okay, eat like eight, okay?
4045788	4051674	No, anyways, um, another FQ I have is, of course, to the little punk, wannabe punk brigade over at Scandia.
4051974	4059482	They're stupid and annoying, they don't know what the hell a coin system is, and they think they're really cool because they can pass, like, exotic ethnic on light.
4060843	4063465	Are you trying to get Legend of Max on roulette?
4065067	4066008	No, not at all.
4067472	4072999	And yeah, especially that little mohawk kid comes up to me four fucking times after I tell him every new time.
4073339	4074961	So how does a token line work?
4075782	4077684	Like, just put your damn token up there.
4077724	4079066	Four times, I just walked off.
4079166	4080608	I didn't even say anything.
4081969	4082991	Whose tokens are those?
4083031	4083952	Because I want to take them.
4085564	4088448	I just said there were some guys, so they didn't take it.
4088628	4092392	Another FU I have is to, we'll call them drunk kids.
4093353	4099560	Last night at the party, some kids were trying to get drunk, and it was really stupid, and I'm going to kill them whenever I find them.
4102678	4109224	And another one is to those, yeah, to those fucking pads, because they should be, like, registered as lethal weapons.
4109844	4115629	I moved the fucking pad twice, and I got cut four times because the sheet metal is so sharp on the side.
4115649	4121414	It's like, I was sitting there on the pad, and all of a sudden I just noticed I was bleeding on my hand for no reason.
4122299	4127042	Not to mention that, but the fact that the pads are bent in half, that the one side doesn't really work too well.
4128503	4131905	And this is, it got bent in half just from one game of playing on them.
4132425	4138229	And then, that and the fact that the wires are coming out, and yeah, that's that.
4140419	4153288	One last one is to Bel Air for having fucking two things left of the Smirnoff Triple Black and one of them is missing a fucking bottle and so we can only get one and have to resort to like substituting.
4153668	4157991	That was the worst thing ever and that's all because I don't want to talk no more.
4158011	4158171	Next.
4162274	4163795	Okay, it's my turn.
4164636	4167217	First, hi, DarkSakura, thanks for saying hello.
4167237	4169379	Hi, Irene, how are you?
4169499	4170219	Are you out there?
4171400	4172401	Not angsty enough.
4173521	4177644	Okay, my plushies aren't that great, but here we go.
4179847	4181868	Well, yeah, okay, we'll start with that.
4181908	4185909	Fuck you to laundromats, because going to laundromats is not fun.
4186809	4191371	Today was my first experience in years to go to a laundromat, and it wasn't too bad.
4191431	4197213	I was in a hurry, though, so it just kind of sucks having to share your laundry with the whole world.
4197773	4200254	So anyway, back to other things.
4200834	4201854	Fuck you to my computer.
4202755	4203955	It's not working properly.
4204275	4206896	I can't get it to work hardly at all.
4207897	4230624	Oh, yeah, okay, thanks to me, I did my good deed for the week, I gave 0x my extra 32 megabytes of RAM for his computer, which only had 32 megabytes of RAM, so I gave him an extra one, and now it has 64 megabytes of RAM, and now it works nicely, so that's my good deed for the week.
4231904	4234745	I know, it was like, yeah, it was extra.
4235045	4235345	What's that?
4237543	4240044	You have 512 megabytes of RAM.
4240084	4241124	I have 512 in my old computer.
4241584	4244845	My current one is like 80-something DDR RAM now.
4245285	4246485	Whoa, that's nice.
4246705	4248506	It's not a game.
4249386	4249866	Yeah.
4251106	4264409	Well, yeah, right now my computer is not functioning, and I think there's a virus on it, and I can't tell, because I can't get online yet, but I don't know how to figure it out.
4264429	4266250	Your computer has never had a virus scanner?
4267647	4271910	Yeah, I think I got something stupid on there, but I'll have to figure it out.
4272070	4279434	Anyway, and fuck you to the Kmart on Stockton Avenue, because they have... Stockton Boulevard, excuse me.
4280835	4283577	There are people that work there that really suck.
4283597	4286739	They can't do anything, and they never have enough people at the cash register.
4288849	4290149	Yes, I know, it's a Kmart.
4290209	4292590	It's going downhill fast.
4295370	4301172	And fuck you to guys, and I won't say why, I just hate guys, and guys suck.
4301192	4303592	Sorry to all you guys out there who are decent guys.
4305032	4308633	But guys who really suck, fuck you.
4308693	4311254	And yeah, fuck you to lack of sex.
4311654	4312934	Guys who suck, here's my number.
4314854	4315675	And I'm done.
4316295	4316955	What's your name?
4319574	4320514	Ice Queen.
4321215	4323756	I have to agree with Rob's fuck you to lack of sex.
4323776	4326577	It's been so long, I don't even remember what a penis looks like.
4326637	4328157	Except my own.
4328257	4335440	Oh, great, that's lovely, thank you.
4335980	4344984	Also, I have to back up Jamie's fuck you to her boss, because bosses everywhere suck, and they should all be freaking tarred and feathered and thrown out into the street naked.
4346994	4350359	Well, with the exception of Loki's boss, because I guess Loki's boss rocks.
4350379	4358470	But other than that, fuck not having a computer and fuck not having... Well, actually, fuck having a job, period.
4358690	4361574	And having to have a job to make money.
4362556	4364058	And that's about it this week.
4368266	4370487	You say fuck having a job.
4370527	4372307	Can I say fuck not having a job?
4372628	4373408	I should rephrase that.
4373488	4375368	Fuck having to have a job to have money.
4375388	4376849	Can I say fuck having your job?
4377229	4377889	Well, that too.
4378129	4378489	That works.
4378550	4381110	People need to pay me because I'm cool.
4382611	4385212	Pay me for the privilege of being in my presence.
4385412	4386832	I'm just going to become a porn star.
4386872	4387372	You know why?
4387693	4389973	Because you're getting paid to have sex.
4391634	4394235	That's two of my big problems right there.
4396121	4398982	I don't want to go by the point and see Robin.
4401803	4407844	Well, you'd see my dick on the cover, so you know you'd be all, I better stay away from this, Rob's naked on the cover.
4409125	4410425	What if you're one of the extras?
4410445	4413846	I am much better than a fluff boy.
4415147	4416147	Everyone has to start somewhere.
4418327	4418668	Whatever.
4420348	4422169	Even Ron Jeremy makes cameos now.
4422189	4423569	Is there anything else?
4424366	4425067	Ninja Usagi Koei
4447501	4448221	Our first F.U.
4448241	4450902	goes to rocks in the woods that aren't fat people friendly.
4451842	4454263	The second will go to Namco for no free play.
4454303	4454823	They suck.
4455503	4462745	The third will go to all politicians for being so fucking stupid and sending us to war and just ignoring other possibilities because they're so fucking power hungry.
4463245	4464685	Arigato, Hanemate.
4465325	4465485	F.U.
4465505	4466546	to Freedom Fries!
4468866	4469426	Okay.
4477358	4477718	Moving on.
4478859	4484081	Satome Ranma says... Oh, I got the link to the video.
4484141	4484941	We'll do that next week.
4485262	4486402	You gonna draw on that?
4486422	4486642	Fine.
4487723	4495987	Says, alright, my FU of the week goes to 2DX for being so far away from me, to 2DX for being so hard, and to 2DX for having so many vague songs on it.
4496687	4498228	I remember what that used to be like.
4498848	4499448	Vague.
4500268	4501789	That's an interesting way of phrasing it, vague.
4501929	4502189	Okay.
4505031	4505571	Mulheimer.
4507537	4512418	Mulheimer says, fuck people being dumbasses and talking about everyone behind their backs and being dumb like that.
4512958	4513978	You must be in high school.
4514658	4519119	Fuck gay lifeguarding classes that took up my Friday night and Saturday and Sunday afternoons.
4521100	4524880	Wait, where can I sign up to be a gay lifeguard?
4524920	4525600	That's awesome.
4528421	4533682	Fuck Sundays and fuck having to decide my courses for next year already.
4537270	4538451	I don't know, that's kind of crazy.
4538471	4539852	Because Church is boring.
4545995	4549017	Doo-dee-doo-dee-doo, no one can hear you, except for me.
4550978	4553339	Alright, moving on, sorry.
4555000	4559082	Justin Circuit says, my FU goes to people who get in Jamie's way when she drives.
4562724	4563565	Jamie is my hero.
4566629	4567030	Okay.
4567530	4570893	Japanman says, Fuck my family for not supporting my DDR efforts.
4571574	4574016	Fuck DDR for not having Cool7 on Extreme.
4574736	4581542	Fuck Texas for Daikinkai being the number one song everywhere, so when I play it for my first time, I get bashed because all the dudes are tired of it.
4581962	4583624	Fuck the DDR dudes in my city, too.
4584044	4586146	Ooh, and play Skagogo on one of your breaks, please.
4586706	4587047	We'll see.
4587867	4588228	We'll see.
4591543	4593184	F you to the DMV for failing me.
4593284	4594344	Oh, I'm sorry.
4594404	4596045	This is from Skyline DC 505.
4596705	4601568	Fuck you to the DMV for failing me during the drive test for a dangerous maneuver.
4602068	4603228	Stupid, stupid bitches.
4603268	4604569	And fuck you to Little Kids of Scandia.
4605249	4608491	I would like to request more information on what that dangerous maneuver was.
4609091	4610392	So send that over, please.
4611312	4624248	Dr. Tuya says, continued FU to being single, I need a date, dammit, and fuck banging my foot on the vacuum, it freaking hurts and fuck the United States Postal Service, Angel Snail Mail didn't arrive yesterday I haven't gotten any either
4626218	4628880	I thought it was hilarious, I was laughing my ass off during that video.
4629540	4632842	Well you're a sick fuck.
4654775	4657359	If you ever want to see good comedy, watch any of the Red Asphalts.
4657679	4660123	It's, like, better than Spike and Mike.
4660644	4662347	They're all, oh my god, it's so horrible!
4662367	4664811	And they just show a dead person on, like, leading on a steering wheel.
4668356	4668537	True.
4669355	4672137	Fuck you to the little kids who told the people at my table to shut up.
4672658	4678563	The only person that can tell me to shut up is the fucking teacher, not some stuck-up, cousin-humping piece of shit that lives in Natomas.
4678583	4679003	Fuck them.
4679664	4685989	Also, fuck you to that stupid shitwad that thinks judo is kicking someone in the nuts as hard as you can and then throwing their limp body over you.
4686329	4688631	That's not judo, that's fucking mental retardation.
4688651	4689872	Dude, that's ghetto judo, man.
4689892	4692295	My balls still fucking hurt, so fuck you, buddy.
4694349	4698211	and fuck you to the fucking asshole bassoon player that left me all alone in my orchestra.
4698571	4703653	I have to play all of my parts alone and I can't play contrabassoon because we won't have a regular bassoon if I did.
4704313	4706814	Hey, if your band has a contrabassoon clarinet, I'll play it.
4707375	4707915	I'll volunteer.
4708355	4709976	Fuck him right in his little bitch ass ear.
4710016	4711356	I fucking hate his worthless ass.
4711416	4713777	Fucking shack of shit, fuck it, fuck it all, fuck.
4714598	4716058	Bloody fucking hell, fuck it all.
4717099	4717439	Beautiful.
4720371	4742908	23rd Magus says, fuck you to being broke, probably can't enter March Madness, I cry, fuck you to Angel being in Japan and not here in SAC, I cry again, fuck you to my parents not getting me and having their heads stuck up their asses, I cries more Rice, RYC3 says, fuck you bad mic with buzzing, I agree, fuck you slow week, move faster, fuckity fuck fuck fuck, that is all
4745049	4746750	BlackLab says, more FUs.
4747011	4748452	I don't even, did I even get the first ones?
4748492	4749953	I don't remember reading BlackLab FUs.
4751754	4754596	Well, he says number six, I don't remember seeing one through five, but whatever.
4755437	4762643	Uh, fuck the shitty internet connection in the dorms, and uh, fuck Chipotle burritos, they're too damn good, I had them four times this week.
4763784	4766446	Fuck this whole Chipotle trend, okay.
4767739	4770301	I like the Chipotle burritos, but you know what?
4770341	4771722	They make me sick every time I eat them.
4772223	4773804	Isn't it pronounced Chipotle?
4774925	4776346	Chipotle or something like that?
4776386	4776766	Okay.
4777687	4780449	Anybody seen that one Jack in the Box commercial?
4780850	4782271	Great.
4782311	4784493	DDR Mike would like to say, fuck you to Concord.
4789637	4790798	Ooh, Concord.
4791258	4795442	Skyline says that his dangerous maneuver was that he messed up in a left turn.
4797478	4798018	Yeah, what did you do?
4798038	4799959	You turned right in a left turn or something?
4801479	4803880	Or did you try to turn left from the right turn lane?
4805220	4806540	What kind of humorous stuff is that?
4806620	4811261	When you turn left and you're with a driving instructor, you're not supposed to power slide.
4812422	4817843	Yeah, I would just like to remind everybody out there that real life driving is not like initial D. You don't want to drift.
4821778	4822318	You know what?
4822438	4828220	Everything that I learned... It was funny, the whole time I was taking JB home, I'm like, okay, what I just did, don't do that.
4829940	4832141	That turn that I made in the middle of the road, you don't want to do that.
4832281	4832761	That's illegal.
4838722	4841703	Jonas sent us some lovely FUs over email.
4842423	4843003	Explicits.
4843283	4844724	You might know him by, he's been on the show before.
4844764	4845764	He says, fuck you to my...
4849429	4852710	Our best thoughts for him at this moment right now.
4853810	4855931	Yes, definitely.
4856031	4859712	But he would like to help console himself through that by doing a little bit of venting.
4859792	4861353	He says, F you to my Calc teacher.
4861433	4863233	And he draws the little ASCII middle finger.
4863694	4868895	She does not understand what I was going through and told me there's no chance I have to pass the class, so I decided to withdraw.
4869235	4869915	I can't believe this.
4869935	4876718	It's just sick to fail a person whose dad just passed away and missed a midterm.
4876738	4877538	So fuck her for that.
4878278	4882302	And another F you to the asshole who was pissing me off so badly at a situation like this.
4882723	4886046	Like I told him I wasn't in the mood to get pissed off, but he intended to do so anyway.
4886086	4887107	That's just disgraceful.
4887547	4892392	As much as I want to rip his skull so bad, the teacher was there, and I don't want to get in trouble from the cops.
4892512	4895275	Oh yeah, F you to the cops because they won't let me rip this asshole apart.
4895835	4896796	Saying I'd be arrested.
4898438	4900340	He'll be gone for a little while, but not retired.
4902116	4905997	You know the whole deal with the midterm, I'm assuming that's college courses?
4906257	4910799	You can take that up with the dean of that particular college and they should take care of it.
4913960	4917441	Alright, some good advice from Jamie, because Jamie knows how to kick ass and take names.
4919372	4921274	Black Lab, we got the other FUs.
4921374	4923556	He says, fuck my upcoming finals, they suck.
4923616	4924457	Fuck legal battles.
4924537	4930643	My girlfriend's plans to visit me during her spring break are currently fucked over because her aunt is in legal trouble with her business.
4931123	4934827	Fuck the engineering two building computer labs for closing at 10pm on Friday nights.
4935187	4938070	I had a project due at midnight that I couldn't finish because they closed early.
4941724	4942925	Fuck flat bike tires.
4942985	4948992	I got one on Friday night and on my way home from working on my project, thus forcing me to walk a good distance in the rain and dark.
4949412	4950413	Fuck power outages.
4950533	4953176	One happened Friday night and it screwed up my computer and iPod settings.
4955378	4959943	Oh, and Skyline says he didn't see the oncoming traffic when he made the left turn.
4959963	4962326	That's awesome.
4966821	4970403	Justin Circuit wants to add F you to Comcast for still not fixing my email.
4970443	4973004	If this next request doesn't fix it, ah.
4975365	4977106	I told you what you need to do with them.
4977806	4979347	You just let me call them, okay?
4979547	4980608	I'll get your email back.
4980888	4981628	Let me call them.
4983589	4992734	And last but certainly not least, we have MinikinigoJazz for saying, Fuck you to teachers who complain about noise in the hallways.
4992834	4995015	If you want quiet, close your fucking door.
4996875	5002921	Yeah, if you don't like noise, you probably shouldn't be teaching because it's too loud.
5003061	5011109	Well, that remark about teachers not teaching, if they didn't teach, they wouldn't be able to do anything because you figure they're teachers because they can't make it doing what it is that they teach.
5011170	5012191	One of my high school teachers...
5013052	5014013	and so on.
5031993	5035575	And see, everyone really didn't care for her just because she was so nuts already.
5036195	5038136	But she left the classroom to go take care of something.
5038516	5042038	And when she got back, all the students had turned their desks around backwards.
5042798	5046220	And if I remember correctly, they even moved her desk to the opposite side.
5047140	5048461	When she came in, she had a breakdown.
5049781	5051202	And apparently went on hiatus.
5051582	5052183	No, it's funny.
5052483	5056025	I've never really had any teaching experience, even though I think that'd be fun.
5056065	5063210	But I used to do marshaling for Cusar, which is obviously pretty much no work at all, but you have to do a little brief, which is kind of funny.
5063611	5065692	And I did one for this one girl who's losing her voice.
5065752	5067173	This is after I quit working there.
5068789	5075899	But my favorite way I entered the brief because no one was really, everyone was talking, it was, um, SHUT THE FUCK UP!
5076300	5077582	And then everyone was like, huh?
5078022	5078223	What?
5078663	5080546	And then I did my brief, yelling at them.
5081047	5085133	It was cool because I couldn't get fired because I never worked there.
5086969	5090890	The best teacher thing I ever did was when I was in 8th grade.
5091130	5094591	We had this one teacher, you knew she was like a big druggy.
5094712	5098313	You could only tell because she would eat sunflower seeds in class and then just fall asleep.
5100453	5107496	One time we made a big ol' packaging tape and made a big ball out of it and threw it at the chalkboard right behind her head.
5108296	5109576	She jumped like 10 feet.
5109856	5114318	And my friend and I personally made it our mission to get her out of the class and we drove her to rehab.
5115418	5120401	We drove her nuts and we found her drunk buddy one day in class and that was all the evidence we needed.
5120801	5122062	I bet you make your mother proud.
5122082	5125724	Hey, my mom was there saying it's about time you did something good.
5127979	5131622	I'm one of those chips over there that are on the floor.
5131982	5135464	Anyone else have any, like, mess with the teacher stories they want to share?
5136685	5137045	Blink blink.
5137065	5143489	I just remember when my teacher would take away, like, something I was drawing on in class, and then I went up to his desk and took it right and then left the classroom.
5143509	5145431	I was like, you stole from me, this is my property.
5145951	5151355	Well, um, I, this isn't messing with the teacher, but this is messing with another student.
5151795	5167165	Uh, this one, I don't know what, what, you know, uh, prompted me to do this, but some girl in fourth grade that I used to talk to, uh, I would only talk, only her, no one else, I'd talk to her with a fake Spanish accent, and then at the very last day of the year, I'd talk normal, and she's like, what happened to your voice?
5167665	5169406	What are you talking about?
5169446	5171548	It was hilarious.
5171568	5172768	That's so stupid.
5176687	5178569	Loki, tell us about your MC Hammer pants.
5179410	5179891	Oh, yeah.
5180191	5181533	You were telling me about this yesterday.
5182034	5186259	Back in, like, 6th grade when I was, like... It wasn't even... I think it was 6th grade.
5186279	5187320	I don't remember.
5187380	5189423	Anyways, it was, like, after they had built this one in school.
5189443	5190685	I remember I used to wear these stupid things.
5190705	5191506	They're, like, these bright...
5191986	5197952	Neon, like, god-awful, I don't even know what was on them, just, like, these pants things.
5197992	5208822	They were almost like empty hammer pants, but his were, like, kind of, like, silk, so they weren't, like, silk or anything, but I used to wear those all the time and think they were, like, the coolest thing, and I used to be awesome at German dodgeball.
5208842	5213826	I was just like, yeah, look at me in my pants!
5214847	5215147	So...
5216386	5221130	I remember in 11th grade, I took advanced English.
5223232	5229597	And I would sleep all day in my classes and my teacher wouldn't care because I would always pass my tests and I never read the book.
5231798	5236202	I just happened to retain everything that she said in class while I was asleep.
5236923	5240666	Proof that those subliminal learning tapes might actually have worked.
5242176	5243637	Of course, I could learn in my sleep.
5244097	5245298	And again, high school is a joke.
5246099	5253724	In Spanish class, when we'd watch a movie, we'd steal the test for the next two or three months, and we stole midterm and sold it at the beginning of the year.
5254748	5272416	In chemistry class, I took the later afternoon chemistry class, and we would go whenever we had substitute teachers and were left busy work to do, you know, just those forms to fill out, we would go into the assignment box, because we would have to, we had this little stack of inboxes that we would put in our papers.
5273076	5283001	We would take the early morning classes papers, and take the person who we know always got the answer right, and copy off the answers on there, turn them back in, spend the rest of the day playing Game Boy in class.
5284853	5285794	I kid you not, I've done it.
5288477	5303231	The only thing I can remember from high school that was funny was one time, this is a very short story, I was in class, I was in ROTC in high school, and my best friend Becky, she gave me, she was like, come here Anita, come here, come here, let me show you something.
5304052	5305554	She had a Playgirl magazine.
5306294	5308436	www.DarkSakura.com
5328977	5332220	and here I am with a Playgirl magazine in ROTC class.
5333462	5336585	Well, luckily, our teacher... What grade was this again?
5336885	5338807	This was like, I was a sophomore in high school.
5339447	5340889	I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna tell him!
5341009	5343852	Dude, that bitch should have fucking gotten slapped aside and...
5344653	5350359	I'm going to tell because I'm a teacher's pet and I want to be a teacher's best friend.
5350920	5353583	And if she would ask me, I would sleep with her.
5355185	5359570	I don't know if it was quite like that, but she was just acting up.
5360205	5363628	If she bent over to kiss my ass, I would be so there.
5365469	5367551	Well, anyway, what happened was nothing.
5368111	5368832	I didn't get caught.
5369652	5378279	The teacher came close to check what was going on, but he looked, and I think he realized what was going on, and he was like, I don't want to go there, and he just walked away.
5378359	5382021	He walked up to the girl who was gone.
5383543	5385064	I used to read comic books on geometry.
5386863	5387923	Comic books and geometry?
5388203	5390304	Oh my gosh, I have a story about geometry class.
5390824	5395005	My geometry teacher, and I have a picture of him actually with me, not here with me.
5395065	5395885	Actually, yes, they're in the car.
5395925	5397165	I can't find them.
5397185	5400606	My teacher looked like a treasure troll with no hair.
5403466	5404806	What color was the hair?
5404906	5405546	Oh, no hair.
5406207	5407907	Well, he had, you know, he was bald on top.
5408327	5409727	Well, how do you look like a treasure troll?
5409787	5410987	He had the face of a treasure troll.
5411908	5412408	Same shape.
5412448	5413748	And the other classes called him Jolly.
5414511	5414951	Jolly?
5415211	5416252	No, his name was Mr. Jolly.
5416592	5418593	The other classes either called him Jolly or they called him Elmer.
5419354	5419854	Whoa.
5419934	5420595	Like Elmer Fudd.
5421975	5424117	That was when they're one butt ugly man.
5425678	5426218	Yeah.
5426858	5428959	But I would just read comic books because I didn't care.
5429920	5430060	Oh.
5430500	5433202	And then there was the one time in class where to confuse him.
5433920	5436345	I asked him, can you truly square infinity?
5436425	5445923	Because any number, the only numbers that you can multiply, you've said this yourself, it's a proven mathematical fact, that the only numbers that you can square and have them equal themselves are 1 and 0.
5447509	5447909	Right?
5448309	5448589	Right.
5449210	5456952	Well, you can't square infinity because if the only two things that can equal themselves are zero and one, infinity squared cannot equal infinity.
5457972	5463813	That just disproves that, though, because infinity... Infinity's not even a number, though, so I guess that doesn't disprove infinity.
5463893	5464474	It's not a number.
5465754	5466294	It's an idea.
5466614	5466994	Exactly.
5467234	5470815	But I was using it in mathematical terms, and he was like, oh, of course you can.
5470855	5473116	You can square anything that has any type of...
5478972	5482835	So basically I've managed to disprove him during the middle of his class and make him look like a big idiot.
5483235	5484977	I feel like I'm in school right now.
5485377	5485957	Can we stop?
5488319	5489260	Okay, we can stop.
5489320	5490201	I was a little brat.
5490341	5491382	Okay, no more school.
5497580	5501843	We're going to take a quick break, then we're going to come back, and I think we want to do our list list when we come back from the break?
5501863	5502084	Sure.
5502184	5503805	Okay, tonight's list list.
5504486	5506007	So, who wants to participate tonight?
5506627	5507508	Okay, oh, everybody?
5507988	5508249	Six?
5508429	5508909	We could do it.
5509450	5511231	Okay, but this is the interesting thing.
5511291	5512172	Okay, the list tonight.
5512532	5515755	Top three things that Konami needs to apologize for.
5517736	5522300	Okay, so think about that during the break, and we'll be back.
5523921	5524301	Alright.
5625706	5626569	Thank you for watching!
5828357	5830081	It's a long way to go, honey.
5831203	5831563	I know.
5832605	5833247	But I'm afraid.
5833287	5836132	How are we going?
5836192	5838857	Into the dark, black forest.
5914253	5916936	Into the Dark Black Forest.
5925005	5928268	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.
5928809	5930351	Orange Lounge Radio.
5932830	5936515	Hi, we're back and we've got our list list.
5936555	5940640	Alright, tonight's topic is top three things that Konami needs to apologize for.
5941281	5941541	Yes.
5942863	5943964	Okay, but is everybody done?
5944525	5945226	Everybody did finish?
5945326	5945827	Okay, great.
5947406	5948847	I would find another reason.
5968542	5969862	There are a few things they could fix.
5969983	5971724	It was not for Parapara Paradise.
5973605	5974806	Alright, go for it, Jamie.
5974846	5977588	You wanted to start... Oh, let me... I'm sorry, I have to bring up the list.
5977868	5981111	My Word document where I can actually make lists here.
5982211	5984213	And notice how I've never erased that erotic one.
5984353	5985354	That was the greatest one we ever did.
5985814	5987175	Alright, Jamie, your number three pick.
5987995	5990797	They have not done any more Super Konami World games.
5992619	5996902	Super Konami World... They had done two of them on the Nintendo...
5998084	6006948	and you could play as boy or girl and go to the Castlevania universe and then go to the Gradius universe and then it's like a bunch of Konami games in one and it was neat.
6007488	6008869	And they haven't done any since.
6010290	6012051	We need more Super Konami World.
6012671	6014312	No new Super Konami World games.
6014392	6015332	Jamie's number three pick.
6015692	6016072	Loki.
6020634	6022976	They should apologize for...
6028168	6030369	They should apologize for DDRPC.
6031570	6032210	And why is that?
6033091	6034491	The game sucks ass.
6035072	6036012	The game sucks ass.
6036052	6036372	Alright.
6038013	6040795	Zero, what should Konami apologize for?
6041715	6046418	One I just put basically was shitty steps for hella good songs on Xtreme.
6046958	6049280	Like, sync steps suck.
6050000	6051201	Frozen Ray sucks.
6052256	6053197	V sucks.
6054078	6055739	I mean, the list could just go on.
6055839	6056840	Colors sucks.
6058141	6060843	I mean, do I even need to say more about that?
6061483	6063625	Alright, shitty steps for good songs on Xtreme.
6063885	6065146	Anita, your number three pick.
6066968	6070070	My number three, I think they should apologize.
6071011	6072092	Mine are weak, but here we go.
6072652	6074734	For not making DDRUSA better.
6080012	6082193	Yeah, well, I'm actually talking about the arcade game.
6082973	6086715	Oh, okay, so the arcade, I'll specify that, not making DDR USA arcade better.
6086895	6090877	Yeah.
6091698	6099962	They should have had, I think it sucked that they didn't have any Korean songs on there, because that was what made, yeah, well, I know.
6100302	6104464	That made, like, the first, second, and third mixes the best, though, I thought.
6106528	6108590	Ice Queen Ah, for discontinuing keyboard mania.
6130740	6132121	Sorry, I'm typing.
6132621	6136823	When there's dead air, it's up to the person who said something to elaborate on what they said.
6137343	6137603	All right.
6137944	6140665	Because I don't get the list in advance.
6140725	6141105	My turn.
6141145	6143466	The number three thing they should apologize for.
6143787	6146028	You know, I actually had DDRPC on my list.
6146228	6151510	So I'm going to say the number three thing that Konami should apologize for.
6151971	6156273	And I apologize in advance to some folks in our chat room because they're really going to hate me for saying this.
6156633	6158454	But they need to apologize for the whistle song.
6159696	6161077	Yes, that song fucking sucks.
6161698	6170024	And I know there's fans of it in the chat room, but you need to understand, I had no problem with the song until other people ruined it for me.
6171024	6174047	By just, by like chanting along to it and all that stuff.
6175328	6179791	It's now ruined, and now it needs to be apologized for, so, alright.
6181092	6182353	That song just sucks anyway.
6182373	6188978	Um, my number two pick is they should apologize for the bad voice acting in Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
6192119	6196821	That game had atrocious voice acting in comparison to the Japanese version.
6198181	6201322	It was not by my hand that I was once again given flesh.
6202923	6203843	Die, monster!
6204163	6205603	You don't belong in this world!
6206484	6209385	Oh yeah, well die, Richter voice actor, you don't belong in this game!
6209465	6209805	Ha ha!
6211235	6211555	All right.
6212336	6213457	Loki, your number two pick.
6214618	6216079	Um, let's see.
6216379	6219442	I would have to say they need to apologize.
6220663	6224286	This should almost be a number one, but they need to apologize for B4U.
6225707	6228209	I hate the group B4U.
6228229	6229390	They can all die.
6229890	6230251	Okay?
6231031	6231532	All of them.
6234094	6235555	Jamie had that written as her number one.
6235615	6236255	Now she's thinking.
6237677	6237997	All right.
6241156	6242978	Uh, your number two pick, Zero.
6243639	6246003	Um, basically fucking over the US.
6246263	6252732	When it comes to any DDR releases, or pretty much any B-Mani release, we get, like, the total shit end of the stick.
6253422	6261127	We got, like, what, four mi- like, three mixes of DDR, because I'm not even counting that horrible-ass Disney's mix or whatever.
6262408	6265249	The Japanese one was good, but the US one was totally just raped.
6266150	6271473	It was... Yeah, Dance Magic was a cool thing, but, like, the game itself sucked.
6271914	6272374	All the other...
6273203	6273343	Okay.
6292461	6293302	Oh, I guess it's my turn.
6293462	6293722	Okay.
6295303	6296263	Let's see, where am I here?
6297164	6301687	Oh, I think we should apologize for not making more mixes of Para Para Paradise.
6302527	6303648	Arcade game.
6307150	6311773	I mean, I know Para Para Para itself kind of died in Japan, but shoot.
6312353	6314655	You know, it's one game.
6315115	6315415	Huh?
6316736	6317517	Yeah, was it?
6317597	6317857	Really?
6319824	6320585	Is it going to be a cure?
6320645	6322847	The Parapara craze is actually starting to pick up here.
6322867	6323828	A few places.
6324148	6326950	Like in the dance clubs kind of thing?
6327531	6330714	Well, they've had Parapara All-Stars touring the U.S.
6331574	6332255	You're kidding me.
6332415	6337600	At Anime Expo, they had them giving out flyers and doing instructions at Anime Expo last year.
6337800	6338721	That's fly!
6340202	6340642	Awesome.
6341063	6343625	Don't go to Anime Expo, by the way, because it's the worst convention ever.
6343645	6344105	So, yeah.
6348536	6350017	Well, more para para, please.
6351298	6353399	Anyway, I'll pass the microphone.
6353919	6354279	Yes.
6355340	6362124	Okay, Konami really needs to apologize, and this is kind of an addition to Zero's earlier statement.
6362985	6366567	They need to apologize for Konami USA, period.
6368888	6370249	I'm elaborating on his.
6370269	6371209	That was my original idea.
6371490	6373471	Konami America is just...
6374435	6376717	I'm sorry, it is just not limited to Banbani.
6377538	6384445	Everything that they made in Japan that has been transferred over to the US through Konami USA sucks.
6385266	6387028	They raped it up the ass and started punching it.
6387068	6388089	What is that, donkey punching?
6388609	6388990	Yeah.
6389891	6391452	I'm like, I'm sorry, but that's just it.
6394075	6394435	Period.
6395316	6395556	Next.
6397165	6406308	Alright, my number two pick that Konami needs to apologize, excuse me, things that Konami needs to apologize for, I would say Castlevania 64.
6406648	6406988	Yeah.
6408789	6415871	Yeah, I know, but I actually had it on my list before it was said in the chat room, but whatever.
6416271	6422333	When I first started playing that game, I thought it was, it almost started off as a good game, and then like halfway through the first level, I was like, eh.
6424013	6426134	Alright, now our number one picks.
6428062	6435486	Um, they need to apologize for the Super Nintendo version of Dracula X. Because I have the PC Engine version.
6436126	6436807	And you know what?
6437407	6454355	Where I actually really like the Super Nintendo one, if ever you've played the, um, the, uh, PC Engine version, then that's like, where the PC Engine version is like eating a feast, the, um, SNES version is like vomit.
6456336	6457077	So, yeah.
6458095	6461436	So, Dracula 5 gets, uh... 5?
6461556	6462456	Isn't that what they called it here?
6462476	6463617	Isn't that what they called it here?
6463637	6465297	No, it was Dracula X on Super Nintendo.
6465357	6466897	Oh, I thought they called it Dracula 5.
6467158	6468418	Or Castlevania 5 or something.
6468458	6469418	No, it's Dracula X. Oh, okay.
6469478	6469858	My bad.
6470278	6470638	My bad.
6470719	6473959	Which was actually cool, because, you know, actually Symphony of the Night was Dracula X, too.
6476040	6476260	Alright.
6477580	6478761	So, you're Loki, I'm sorry.
6479321	6480501	Loki's number one pick.
6482802	6483322	Okay.
6484982	6486543	Um, they need to apologize.
6488320	6489040	for Politary.
6491901	6509426	Because, you know what, she wouldn't have a career if it weren't for DDR, and I would hope that she wouldn't have a career if it weren't for DDR, and I wish she would just go, you know what, we were hoping that you would get better, you never did, so bye.
6511387	6512687	Alright, Zero, your number one pick.
6513464	6518627	My number one pick is for Naoki and all of his 150 other aliases.
6519348	6525832	Because every, I would say about 95% of every song he put on DDR sucks ass.
6526633	6528274	Doesn't matter what it is, it sucks.
6528414	6531096	I mean, how many B4Us and Brilliant 2Us do we need?
6531136	6534378	How many Paranoias and whatever else comes up do we need?
6535258	6537440	So, that would be a good FU also.
6539941	6540242	Alright.
6541923	6542223	Anita.
6543959	6544840	I have a question, Zero.
6544880	6548263	How come you named your cat Naoki then?
6550624	6553547	Because I was actually drunk when I named my cat.
6553807	6556449	And I just got too lazy to try to think of something else.
6556729	6559291	And my cat makes the name Naoki sound cool.
6561033	6563455	Well, your cat was also answering to Naochan, too.
6567818	6568519	Anita, you're number one.
6568539	6569580	Okay, my number one.
6570487	6574529	They should apologize for Let Them Move!
6576330	6577250	Excellent suggestion.
6580551	6582332	Matt, or Ice Queen, your number one pick.
6582872	6583873	They need to apologize.
6586161	6587102	Oh yes, yes.
6588383	6589563	Is that your answer, or what do you want to say?
6589583	6592545	You know what, I had something in mind, but I'm going to change it to Loki's.
6593226	6594406	Bag.
6594446	6594867	Period.
6596087	6600410	Who wants to hear a freaking bat pipe screeching as loud as you can get it?
6600931	6601871	Oh my god, Jamie.
6603192	6603792	Oh my god.
6604113	6604793	No comment.
6606294	6607695	They really need to apologize for that.
6609068	6611229	Okay, very controversial topic in the chat room.
6611249	6612810	We have a lot of people arguing with this.
6612870	6613650	This is interesting.
6613750	6617452	Alright, but my number one, and I'm surprised nobody said this yet.
6618572	6622334	My thing that needs to apologize for, their new logo.
6624675	6625576	What the hell is that?
6627436	6628537	That's not even retro.
6629758	6630878	It's retro my butt.
6630998	6634740	Alright, you want to read this big huge list before we do eliminations?
6635333	6660766	No New Super Konami World Games, DDRPC, Shitty Steps for Good Songs on Xtreme, Not Making DDRUSA Arcade Better, Discontinuing Keyboard Mania, The Whistle Song, Bad Voice Acting, Castlevania XIX, B4U, Clicking Over the US, No New Parapara Games, KonamiUSA, Castlevania 64, SNES version of Dracula X, Politary, Now Keen as 150 Aliases, Let Them Move, Vag, and New Logo.
6661346	6662867	Alright, elimination time.
6663007	6664929	Jamie, what comes off the list?
6665069	6666010	Probably Naoki.
6666690	6667431	Naoki and his 150 aliases?
6667451	6668051	Because...
6670195	6674878	Before I had heard many TAC things, I really liked Naoki's mixes.
6675879	6676719	I'd actually kind of agree.
6676739	6680022	Remember, I was a big fan of Brilliant to You, OG.
6680342	6682443	That was like my favorite song ever.
6682743	6694472	I would agree to some extent because some of the Naoki aliases are bad, like Naoki featuring Paula Terry, and Naoki, or what is it, NMR, like Let Them Move and stuff, those are bad.
6694492	6697194	But like Naoki Underground, who did Insertion, that's pretty cool, so...
6697994	6699996	Although I do agree he needs to get over the identity crisis.
6700157	6702939	Okay.
6703120	6704421	Next, yeah, Loki, what are you taking off?
6705062	6710607	I'm going to take off not making DDR USA Arcade better, because you know what?
6710727	6711628	I just don't care.
6711648	6714831	That machine doesn't exist to me anymore, so whatever.
6718777	6720658	I almost took off that one for one reason.
6721238	6723980	It sort of opened the door for all the new stuff we're getting now.
6728683	6730464	It's red and has Konami on it.
6730664	6731284	It's ugly.
6731905	6734766	Okay, Zero, what's coming off the list?
6734906	6738388	Even though I totally agree, I would say let them move.
6738568	6739209	Take that off.
6739729	6743691	I mean, I absolutely agree with it because it's horrible, but the other ones are better.
6747602	6748362	The Song Sucks
6768957	6772685	Alright, I'll just say shitty steps for a good song setting stream.
6773646	6774147	Okay.
6776592	6778476	Yes, exactly, that is the reason.
6778516	6779618	I am attacking zero.
6782535	6791339	I don't know, I just think you have a very good point, but it just doesn't seem like as much of a bitch as the rest of the stuff.
6792260	6792700	Alright.
6793961	6794861	Decisions final.
6794901	6796062	Matt, what comes off the list?
6796442	6800784	I'll have to take off the new logo just because, you know, there's so many other things on there that are so much better.
6801645	6803806	It sucks, but let's review.
6805201	6810525	Uh, I'm gonna get slapped for this, but it's so bad that it's good.
6811046	6814248	I'm taking off the bad voice acting in Castlevania VI Day and Night.
6815509	6821213	Because, you know what, I, I, it's, it's one of those things where it's like, I love mimicking it.
6821633	6822634	Die, monster!
6822974	6824335	You don't belong in this world!
6824395	6828757	And I mean, it's so bad that I love to mimic it, so for that it's redeemable.
6829137	6830118	True of all religions!
6831839	6834180	Dan and I used to quote that game.
6835381	6835681	Okay.
6836707	6844212	And I'm not doing that because Brad is jumping in the chatroom up and down asking me to, but I really do think that it's so bad it's good.
6844912	6848495	So, there you go.
6848635	6853178	Alright, so, wait, I have to close out all the windows first before I can start taking votes here.
6855779	6861923	Somebody had suggested, because of no new remixes by the T-Word, what were some other suggestions?
6861963	6862684	I missed them, oh well.
6863353	6866669	I find it funny that he's been reduced to a four letter word.
6868777	6875299	Alright, we're going to post that list and you guys can send in your votes right now over private message to Sky.
6875659	6876839	Jamie, you want to read the final list?
6877239	6891562	No new Super Konami World games, DDRPC, Discontinuing Keyboard Mania, The Whistle Song, B4U, Fucking Over the US, no new Parapari games, Konami USA, Castlevania 64, the SNES version of Dracula X, Politary, and Bag.
6892283	6893343	Vote now or die!
6895743	6902965	Alright, so vote now and send those votes to Sky in the chat room.
6903165	6903845	You should play bag.
6904566	6905406	You want me to play bag?
6908127	6908407	No!
6908427	6910527	You know what, I can't do it because I'll lose half the listeners.
6910567	6910967	Play Orion.
6911327	6911828	Play Orion?
6911848	6912808	That's almost just as bad.
6913088	6914528	I know, but it's funny.
6914928	6916769	We're going to go to break and we're going to play Orion.
6916809	6918089	We'll play another quick song.
6918489	6921990	We'll try to keep this one a short break because we want to do the cage match tonight at some point too.
6922491	6923631	So we'll probably do that when we come back.
6925240	6931550	So, we will do a quick break.
6932151	6932472	Which one?
6932552	6934034	You want the old school one or you want the new one?
6934235	6934896	Old school one.
6934916	6935457	Okay, old school one.
6935897	6936418	We'll be back.
6936899	6938261	Send your votes in now, please, please, please.
6953268	6955342	Achievement Achievement Achievement
7030062	7036536	Um, I apologize because that was mislabeled, so that wasn't the old school one, but I found the right one, so enjoy!
7036636	7037198	A double shot!
7218655	7225521	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
7226362	7232327	Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to, and still the fun is just as great.
7232647	7234549	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
7235129	7239513	Kick it with me, and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
7241343	7242124	Howdy, kids!
7242424	7251574	We're back, and we're being a little slow because the listless votes aren't fully tallied yet, so we're going to go right into this week's cage match.
7251775	7253937	Last week... Oh, I've got to get all this stuff queued up, though.
7253957	7254438	I'm not even ready.
7255954	7260698	Is there anything, uh, wait, wait, but you said you wanted to make a stipulation before this week's cable.
7260778	7264081	Are you pulling out about what you wanted to do to your song last week?
7264101	7267424	If I withdrew mine, I'd want to put it in a new one, which means I have to go to my car real quick.
7267904	7269505	Oh, so, oh, you have last week's winner in here.
7269606	7273249	I put it in there, but I kind of want to withdraw it and put in something new if I can.
7273729	7274430	What do you guys think?
7275050	7276331	Well, let's ask the chat room what they think.
7276351	7278093	Let's hear a little bit of last week's winner.
7279710	7280191	I hated it.
7280211	7281172	I picked it because it was hyper.
7281192	7282773	Then I'll go to my car.
7332267	7336028	Alright, by an overwhelming vote in the chat room, it's out of here.
7336508	7337048	It's gone.
7337328	7338809	Alright, I'm going to go get a CD out of the car.
7338829	7339209	I'll be right back.
7340336	7340716	All right.
7343038	7345500	So I'm getting suggestions for what to put in this week, too.
7345580	7345960	That's great.
7349162	7352405	Okay, so we're going to start this week's cage match, except I'm short a few songs.
7352645	7353906	So, clean slate.
7353946	7357748	We have no winners coming over from last week, because we're deleting that, because it sucked.
7361991	7362852	I don't know how it won.
7362892	7366074	I guess the other two songs... I put in Fable, and everybody had something against that song.
7366094	7367215	Okay.
7368726	7369928	Alright, so I guess I'll start.
7370528	7375194	Since we're starting with a clean slate tonight, let's refresh everybody on how the cage match works.
7376075	7380520	We have this little segment that reoccurs on the show called the Orange Lounge Cage Match.
7380540	7386627	The way it works, each of the hosts puts in one song that they want to put in there.
7388204	7390367	and the chat room votes on which is their favorite.
7390667	7396895	And the winner gets to go into regular rotation on the station during the Bomani Music and More program.
7397175	7400720	So, I'm getting votes for stuff.
7400780	7401721	This is interesting.
7401841	7402122	Oh, no.
7402482	7403744	Don't tell me what to put in.
7406317	7409784	And like half the ones you're mentioning either suck ass or have already been in there.
7411687	7413771	No, actually, another song by that artist is in there.
7413812	7415996	I get what she was saying.
7416016	7417960	I already have a song for this week, but I'll do that for next week.
7419432	7421933	Oh, I'm so tempted to put that song in, Justin.
7422533	7423874	Or whatever you're called this week, Justin.
7424634	7428575	I really want to put that first song in there you sent me, but I'm not ready to yet.
7428615	7429455	We'll do that next week, okay?
7429475	7430996	Because I really want to do this song this week.
7431336	7431956	So I'll start.
7432877	7439299	My song this week that I'm going to do is by a group that you know from 2DX.
7439399	7442660	They were in 7th Style, and they have a pretty popular song in there.
7444116	7446479	And the song they did in there was called The Beauty of Silence.
7447480	7449122	And the group is Svensson and Gleeland.
7449242	7452386	And this is another song by them.
7452947	7453748	I have this song.
7453988	7454549	Well, cool.
7454589	7456611	This is my pick for tonight's cage match.
7456972	7461037	This is a song called Twisted by the same group that did Beauty of Silence, Svensson and Gleeland.
7461117	7461397	Enjoy.
7474219	7474965	Thanks for watching!
7509241	7510061	Thanks for watching!
7540089	7540631	Thanks for watching!
7579113	7580054	Thanks for watching!
7599611	7601253	That kind of has an abrupt ending, oops.
7601573	7603496	That's because it came off a non-stop mix.
7603596	7607961	Actually, that was the energy mix of Twisted by Svensson and Ghislain, same group that did Beauty of Silence.
7608141	7608882	And what did y'all think?
7609122	7610303	Beauty of Silence, it ain't.
7611345	7612366	Sorry, that was really boring.
7612726	7614168	What do you give it on 110?
7614829	7615730	Well, poop on you!
7615930	7617492	I don't know, I'd give it a 5.
7617552	7618192	Right down the middle. 0.
7623575	7632658	I kind of give it, I had like six songs throughout that, I guess I'll give it like 56, because I really like video sounds, and that seemed to have been really well, so it's more real repetitive.
7634519	7634859	Loki.
7635819	7640781	I've heard better cuts of that same song, and that was a pretty bad cut of it.
7640901	7648903	Like I said, it's repetitive, it does kind of, you know, give you something to feel, but the middle is the beginning of my favorite part, and I give it a 4.
7649263	7650484	Good one, all of you.
7651633	7661818	Ice Queen I can't really do too much of a judgement as far as cast history on this one goes I do like the song Beauty with the Stylist but this one was like well I'm just going by an overall judgement and I have to give it a bottom 5 because it was kind of repetitive
7680368	7682931	but I kind of liked it too.
7683071	7685393	It just sounded kind of nice.
7685734	7690378	Alright, and I personally, I give that a 150, so that way it averages all your votes to a 10.
7690458	7691399	Hey, that's great.
7691980	7692300	Rob?
7692540	7692761	Yes?
7693521	7694643	All your balls need to die.
7694943	7695243	Thank you.
7695283	7695684	Love us.
7697267	7697587	You know what?
7697607	7698128	Y'all suck.
7698188	7699849	I'm never going to win this goddamn thing.
7699930	7700430	I try.
7700750	7702272	I try a different song.
7703133	7705555	All you have to do is pick an Ayumi Trans thing and you'll win.
7705775	7707697	I don't want to pick another Ayumi Trans thing.
7707737	7709458	I don't want to do another Vincent DeMora thing.
7709499	7709699	Why?
7709719	7710479	Because that's cheap.
7710940	7714503	I want to pick something that wins because it's awesome.
7714523	7714864	And you know what?
7714884	7715604	That song's awesome.
7716605	7718407	You all are just, you know what?
7718747	7719908	Okay, you know what JB said?
7719988	7722550	No, I will do JB's song next week then.
7722630	7723331	You will see.
7723871	7724592	I'm going to come back.
7724632	7726273	I'm going to save this clip of the show.
7726333	7731718	And after I play what he sent me next week, I'm going to remind you all that you asked me to play that, okay?
7732018	7733059	That's all I have to say.
7733900	7734801	All right, play mine.
7736222	7738164	And all your balls need to, yeah.
7738504	7739485	Good thing I don't have any.
7739665	7740966	All right, Jamie, what's your pick?
7740986	7741527	Tell us about it.
7741727	7743008	Beatbox, What a Wonderful World.
7759017	7769331	The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky Are all the summer faces, of people calling by I've been praying to shake it down, saying oh
7786863	7787164	Hi.
7789794	7790376	I don't know what happened.
7790416	7790617	I'm sorry.
7808433	7813277	Okay, I'm going to abort this real fast because we're going to try switching it around a little bit.
7813337	7814858	We're having issues with that CD.
7814898	7816159	I burned this like three days ago.
7816379	7816739	Let's see.
7816759	7818801	I'm going to put it in the other drive and see what happens.
7818881	7820042	It's fingerprints.
7820062	7820602	Oh, okay.
7820662	7823044	So do a little clean up on that real fast.
7823364	7823844	Try that again.
7823884	7825045	Pretty big scratch right there.
7825065	7827007	Yeah, it's a pretty big scratch in the middle.
7827027	7828468	I'm just finding my CD player out of my car.
7828588	7829729	Well, let's try it.
7831610	7833012	Okay, we're going to restart this.
7833052	7836436	Actually, you need to play it out of the... This is the burner.
7837057	7841242	So it wasn't playing out of the burner.
7841282	7841963	Sorry about that.
7842123	7844046	I don't have the MP3 of that with me.
7844947	7845948	Okay, we'll try it again.
7848171	7848832	Thank you, everybody.
7848852	7850354	Let's try it again.
7854013	7856896	I'm gonna go ahead and take it in 30 seconds because it's about where we were at.
7858157	7861160	I just have to, uh, get past the CDDB thing.
7861200	7861901	Okay, let's try this again.
7861941	7863022	Introduce the song one more time.
7863242	7863682	From the start.
7863803	7864924	Beatbox of the Wonderful World.
7864944	7865724	30 minutes in.
8036905	8037711	Thanks for watching!
8197205	8198306	I don't like it very much.
8200689	8205533	It was... I'm sorry, I don't like club mixes of songs like that.
8206154	8208436	It just doesn't fit.
8208656	8213301	Everyone thinks that the formula for a dance song is let's put a beat to it and add lyrics from an old song.
8213321	8214562	No, it's not going to work.
8214622	8215243	So, um...
8216923	8221049	And then that part in the end where it started kind of doing this little thing where they started changing the pitch a little bit.
8221309	8224073	Where it started getting way out of key and then coming back in.
8224093	8225354	I don't know what the hell that was either.
8225855	8226896	So I give it a 6.
8227317	8229560	Better than the other song, but still.
8230221	8230521	Alright, 0.
8232083	8248310	Generally, I don't really care what it is, I don't like any type of dance to an old song, especially because that's an excellent song as it was originally, but this is a pretty good remake of it, it kind of tripped throughout a little bit, but I'll give it like a 7.
8249991	8254715	I still did enjoy it though.
8256336	8259638	Okay, I personally like that song.
8259718	8264041	I like the variety, I like how it wasn't the same goddamn beat the whole way through.
8264141	8266743	Some of it faded out, some of it faded back.
8268184	8272688	And yes, I like this song too, the original, so I'm going to have to give that one a 10.
8272828	8273828	Just because that's a happy song.
8273868	8273968	Yay!
8273988	8276510	Yes, that was a happy song.
8276710	8277771	Very, very happy, happy.
8278392	8279012	I liked it.
8279693	8284576	I wasn't too crazy about how the rhythm kind of reminded me of Beauty and Silence in there.
8284616	8285697	Just a little hint of that.
8286137	8289239	But overall, it's a very nice sounding song.
8289380	8291701	A little on the long side, but not too bad.
8291901	8292962	I'll give it an 8.
8294183	8294964	Nice.
8296304	8296745	It's alright.
8297881	8307367	It kind of made me a little bit sleepy, and when I hear it, I see a montage on the news of the slaughtering of RVGL children.
8310229	8310509	I give it a 6.
8310629	8311210	It's alright.
8312774	8315615	That song makes my heart happy whenever I'm in a rotten mood.
8315635	8320176	That's one of the few songs that just makes me happy all over.
8320256	8321436	Okay, fair enough.
8321636	8326578	Well, Twisted makes me happy, so... I'm sorry, Twisted made me vomit.
8326758	8328638	Last pick of the night.
8329099	8330239	Oh, this should be interesting.
8330279	8331879	Loki, what are we going to hear?
8332059	8333400	We heard this last week.
8333520	8337361	I just couldn't think of anything else that I had with the two CDs that I had with me.
8338101	8342403	So this is yet another original remix done by me.
8342583	8346766	It's the Dark Black Forest, Midnight Angel mix.
8347506	8352308	It's Loki versus Steve Reiner featuring Solaris.
8353289	8354149	Okay, here you go.
8444437	8444757	Wait, girl.
8444837	8445798	I know, but I'm waiting.
8445818	8446258	Where are we going?
8446318	8446858	Into the dark, black.
8523082	8525203	to the Dark Black Forest.
8533466	8533886	Okay.
8534727	8535727	What did y'all think of that one?
8536007	8540869	That was Steve Reiner vs. Loki featuring Solaris with Dark Black Forest.
8541309	8545571	Keep in mind that I'm trying to bypass my bias against Dark Black Forest.
8546151	8546451	Okay.
8546551	8549032	Because I'm utterly sick and disgusted with that song.
8549652	8551213	However, it was nicely done.
8552381	8557465	So let's give it, and again I'm trying to bypass my bias, I give it a 7.77777.88.
8557645	8557825	Okay.
8557845	8558106	Loki?
8568016	8570778	As mentioned in the chatroom, it doesn't sound very remixed.
8570818	8577762	There's actually a lot of subtle stuff and there's a few more synth things added to the actual main synths of the song.
8577782	8579743	So it's kind of hard to detect that there.
8580944	8590069	It was a mix between one song by Sonaris, I don't remember exactly what this song was called, and Dark Black Forest's Long Trip.
8591090	8599513	I don't know how many more trips to the Dark Black Forest for me to take, but it was pretty good and Loki's right, there's a lot of subtle stuff, so for you people who didn't hear it, turn your
8618610	8620871	I have to agree with the last two quotes.
8620951	8623431	I give it an 8 just because I liked it.
8623451	8628832	The beginning was kind of a little bit slow, but it was very repetitive to begin with, but then it picked up and I liked it every time.
8649003	8654267	I think I'll give it an 8, because I... Oh, wait a minute, I'm thinking backwards.
8654327	8657849	I'm giving it a 7, because the previous song, I thought that was a little bit better.
8657909	8659490	I like that other one.
8659510	8665474	This one is good, but it does sound a little bit like the original, so I like the first or second entry the best.
8674860	8676841	I would give it... I'd give it an 8.
8677241	8677761	It was cool.
8677861	8679942	It didn't make me as moist as Legend of Trance did.
8680582	8684524	And I think the subtleness isn't... it's not enough.
8684824	8685964	Like, we just need to do more.
8686444	8687545	It was cool, but... yeah.
8687625	8692927	I mean, it was cool, but it was just Dark Black Forest Long Trip with, like, some subtle synth.
8693547	8697088	Well, the next one's going to be totally different than the Trance remixes I've been doing.
8697108	8702010	It's going to be an even more hardcore version of Sligo Works, so you're going to love it.
8703150	8704131	Okay, let's recap.
8704151	8705552	I'm getting happy thinking about that.
8705712	8706513	Quick recap.
8706533	8706953	Here we go.
8707013	8711336	These are the three things you can vote for and you can send your votes now over private message to Sky in the chat room.
8711717	8715800	First one you can vote for, Svensson and Leland with Twisted.
8725988	8727929	Second one you can vote for, Beatbox, right?
8727949	8728469	Is that Beatbox?
8728710	8731512	Beatbox with What a Wonderful World is the other one you can vote for.
8750911	8758277	All right, and the third song you can vote for, Steve Reiner vs. Loki featuring Sonaris with Dark Black Forest.
8775760	8787086	Alright, again, first song was Svensson and Gleeland with Twisted, second song was Beatbox, What a Wonderful World, third song was Steve Reiner vs. Loki featuring Sonaris with What a Wonderful World.
8787126	8790008	I just thought of my next week's song, damn it, that sucks.
8790288	8791749	Oh, you just thought of the song you really wanted to do?
8791769	8794590	I just thought of it, it was like in my car too, it was like, ah, next week.
8795111	8799193	Alright, so there you go, send your votes in now to Sky.
8799233	8804856	In the meantime, we don't want to go right to a break because we just played a bunch of music, so let's try to chat it up a little bit, shall we?
8806482	8807843	Who has something they want to talk about?
8809143	8809504	Loki.
8810204	8811625	Well, let's see.
8812325	8813246	Uh, Jackie?
8813306	8813626	Wait.
8814046	8816487	Haven't made a racial comment this week yet.
8817308	8818208	Oh, dear God.
8820069	8821190	Okay, good, because I'm not going to...
8822822	8837305	I'm not going to, but I was just thinking back to when we were talking over, like, food at TGI Fridays about my blank owner's club game where you have to train your people to eat fast.
8837585	8839125	Oh, God, that was awful.
8841286	8842706	But, no, we're not going to mention that.
8844106	8845787	So, yeah.
8845847	8847307	It's still like MoCap Bakery.
8848384	8849347	And then what was yours?
8849427	8853801	MoCap Hansel and Gretel, where you shove the little children into an oven.
8853821	8855125	You shove little children into an oven.
8858567	8870150	Well, let's see, big news, this week opening up was Dreamcatcher, and for all those, yeah, yeah, I agree, Dreamcatcher looked like ass, but you know what was before it?
8870170	8873791	It was the final play of Osiris, and that kicks ass.
8874592	8875492	I would go see it just for that.
8876712	8882234	I would pay matinee prices just to go see that, and I'd just walk out of the movie.
8885555	8885735	Cool.
8887660	8888842	Oh, I have that on VCD.
8889022	8889763	I have Ringu 2.
8890704	8891105	Not 2.
8891666	8891105	1.
8891786	8892247	I'm sorry.
8892487	8893508	My mind is going again.
8895571	8900999	You know, ever since Puppy introduced me to BitTorrent, I've been loving downloading things for free, like movies.
8901459	8903763	And I downloaded that movie, Phone Booth, which...
8905189	8905769	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8935455	8937421	And then I was getting... Phone booth.
8939125	8940886	It's this new program.
8940946	8942087	It's called BitTorrent.
8942787	8947850	And if Black Lab has a link to that site he gave me, that would be cool.
8948430	8953613	I would say it's like WinMX or something like that, but it's not.
8953673	8956494	It's a little different because it's not a separate client.
8956554	8959276	It's a download tool you install into your browser.
8959696	8963698	So when you start downloading a file with a .torrent extension...
8965579	8972782	What you do is you start downloading this file from, I guess, I don't know, it tells you where everybody else has the file.
8972822	8974323	And you start downloading from people.
8974743	8978525	And then as you're downloading it, when new people start downloads, they start downloading from you.
8979085	8985108	So the key is to make it work, you have to leave your thing on for like a couple hours after you finish so other people can finish their stuff too.
8985448	8987869	But it's a way of just basically file distribution.
8987929	8989670	It's mass leeching and seeding and all that.
8990510	8991151	But it's cool.
8992431	8993392	How I've used it so far...
8994975	9001245	I've gotten a couple CDs in a movie.
9001585	9003949	And I'm working on getting Final Fantasy Origins, but it's not finished yet.
9004249	9007414	And I had to stop it because we had to start the show.
9007454	9009116	The Final Fantasy 1 and 2 for America.
9010129	9011489	I just got it!
9032382	9045371	But if anybody out there has any advice or any experience playing .hack or, well, actually, I think Ice Princess has many good comments on the series, right?
9045572	9045672	No?
9046989	9048050	Yeah, .hack, no?
9048850	9049291	Who was that?
9049331	9050932	Somebody was saying that this series was great.
9051312	9051932	I don't remember.
9052072	9052352	Loki.
9053313	9054174	I heard it was good.
9054594	9055454	I've never seen it.
9055655	9062899	Actually, to be honest, to be honest looking at the game from the screenshots I've seen, it looks like ass, but, you know, I don't know.
9063519	9065661	It's good enough to spawn two more sequels.
9067202	9068183	Whoop-a-dee-doo!
9069224	9072306	I mean, look at, uh, let's see, uh, Saga Frontier.
9073247	9074368	That game sucked ass.
9075709	9078111	I mean, it's an awful game.
9078191	9079993	The first one was just crap.
9080593	9085097	I don't even care about the other ones, you know, it's just, the first one ruined it for me, so I'm not playing anymore.
9085257	9089341	Uh, what would be another one that ruined it for me that they made so many sequels of?
9093724	9097147	I never played Summoner, but I'm sure.
9099149	9104553	Summoner did have one good thing about it, and that was that preview thing that they did based on the Dungeons & Dragons thing.
9105634	9107155	Got any Dr. Pepper?
9107996	9108476	No, Mountain Dew.
9108716	9110017	Got any Mountain Dew?
9110478	9113240	It's like, yeah, it's in the fridge.
9114081	9115502	Am I in the tavern yet?
9116360	9117242	No, why?
9117602	9121108	Cause if there's any hot chicks there, I want to do them!
9124134	9127255	Tenshu, Wrath of Heaven, Wrath of Heaven, whatever.
9146875	9157660	The first level is almost identical to the first level of their original Tenchu, but it's a lot more realistic, and the cutscenes when you stealthily kill somebody is awesome.
9157680	9158860	Their heads just pop right off.
9159881	9162082	You jab them and you can kick cats and dogs.
9163562	9164182	All kinds of stuff.
9164223	9165103	It's actually pretty good.
9169205	9170525	It seems really bloody, too.
9170745	9171906	Isn't it more bloodier than the...
9172925	9173585	Man!
9174126	9184329	Have you ever seen like a Japanese soap opera or any Japanese programs where there's a lot of bloodshed and you see like somebody get cut in the throat and you see like 10 gallons of blood squirt out?
9184369	9185410	That's what this game is like.
9185510	9187130	The bloodshed is the whole point of that game.
9187450	9191972	The bloodshed is the point of that game as to Resident Evil or anything else.
9192332	9194313	It's just really, really cool.
9194333	9197334	It's like asking why anime chicks have such big breasts.
9198094	9198914	They just do.
9199235	9200175	That is the point.
9202213	9205435	No nipples.
9206295	9207856	Why does Saga Frontier suck?
9207956	9208596	Let's see here.
9208937	9213399	Not only do you get one shitty quest, but no, you get 12 shitty quests that you get to go on.
9213419	9214939	They're almost exactly the same.
9215800	9219381	Plus, the graphics sucked ass, and the game was just boring as hell.
9219642	9220602	And the title's crappy.
9220702	9223043	I ended up buying it, playing it for a week, and selling it back.
9224084	9226665	And for the record, graphics do not equal gameplay.
9228012	9233836	The gameplay wasn't anything good either, so I was like, well, maybe the graphics... No, no, sorry.
9234697	9242202	I'm serious, if they had a role-playing game that was like just the regular text-scrolling ones that were from way back in the day, I can enjoy those more if they had a good story.
9242222	9248427	You know what was freaking awesome is they're making this new side-scrolling game that's just like Contra, but you can make your own levels.
9249067	9249547	Oh, that's cool.
9249568	9250708	It's got a level editor in it.
9250969	9251309	That's cool.
9251329	9254891	Now, I've been hearing that Unlimited Saga is supposed to be pretty redeeming.
9254911	9256833	Yeah, see, well, yeah, it's about time.
9266987	9273512	Yes, we're going to come back after a quick break with results for both list lists, because we never did those, and the cage match.
9273552	9275914	So it's going to be a whole results set when we come back from break.
9276194	9279277	But first, the chat room would like to request no Saga Frontier bashing.
9282505	9283386	It sucks ass.
9284066	9288990	In fact, Square should denounce Saga Partigris being part of their whole lineup.
9289710	9291952	You know what game that Square needs to denounce?
9292592	9295814	Is freaking Legend of Mana.
9297655	9299677	No, not Secret of Mana, Legend of Mana.
9299697	9300777	That game was shit.
9301178	9307342	Okay, I was thinking, I went ahead and got the import of that because I was like, oh, you know, it's Legend of Mana, what the hell.
9307402	9309583	I was thinking more Seiken Densetsu.
9310024	9311124	But that was ass.
9312085	9312946	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9333357	9333917	Very nice.
9334558	9336758	Um, or just, you know, borrow my friend's cartridge for Super Nintendo.
9337679	9339860	I bashed Saga Frontier in my sleep.
9340540	9344642	That was a horrible game, and anyone who likes it, play it again.
9345662	9351305	Yeah, if Saga Frontier happens to sneak into my dreams, you know, then suddenly I wake up with the urge to vomit.
9353786	9356887	Good, I'm done with one- Aw, dammit, there's more!
9357387	9358288	One thing in his favor.
9358988	9359788	It had good music.
9360588	9361429	It had some good music.
9363294	9366215	It's like that Rhapsody musical journey or whatever.
9366235	9367315	I wanted to play that.
9367595	9368415	It looked cute.
9368635	9369696	I actually am getting it.
9370016	9372776	One game that sucked?
9372996	9373496	Rice Line.
9374817	9376117	Um, Ephemeral Fantasia.
9376677	9377357	That game sucked.
9378778	9381378	It's a game, it was put out, it was an RPG put out by Konami.
9381958	9384399	And apparently you can use your Guitar Freaks controller with it.
9385569	9386569	That game is ass.
9386649	9391931	Dan and I barely, we didn't even get past the first village before we packaged that shit up and turned it back in.
9392251	9395632	We did not even go as far to see if our controllers would work with the US version.
9396152	9397032	We took that shit back.
9398952	9399312	Okay.
9399332	9400673	More like effeminate Fantasia.
9401593	9402353	Alright, you guys are ready?
9402373	9403253	We're going to take a quick break.
9403653	9405834	And we're going to come back and we have two results to announce.
9405954	9408975	So sit tight.
9408995	9409575	We'll be back.
9454722	9459447	Oh, 90's and 70's with the glue man, original Goldman style, Latin-style, a lot of my play style, set, hop!
9505045	9505829	Thanks for watching!
9612025	9612736	Who shot the-
9653958	9655042	and many more.
9687137	9691279	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
9691699	9691839	No!
9691859	9697381	Do we care what people think of us?
9698022	9699882	No!
9699902	9701323	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
9701783	9702744	Yes!
9705877	9707738	Extreme Bobani Radio.
9707938	9710819	That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
9712259	9713060	Alright, we're back.
9713560	9714480	Featuring the buzz.
9714840	9716481	Episode number 37.
9717781	9718681	Episode number 37.
9718982	9719662	In a row.
9719922	9720182	Thank you.
9720362	9721262	Of Orange Lounge Radio.
9721282	9721683	We're back.
9722043	9724243	And we have results, results, results for you people.
9724263	9726084	And then we're going to whore a few things out.
9726104	9731446	We're going to open it up to the chat room to plug anything they want.
9731966	9734147	Anything they want to plug, you got...
9735208	9736389	15 minutes left to show to do it.
9736429	9738512	I'd be afraid of people plugging stuff in public.
9740034	9744139	Anything you guys want to plug, send it to me over a private message and we'll plug it live on air.
9744780	9746863	Alright, and we got a few plugs of our own we want to do.
9746883	9748625	So we're going to have Plugmania in a minute.
9749226	9750387	In the meantime, let's announce.
9751752	9754033	First, the winners of our listless segment.
9754374	9757916	Top three things that Konami needs to apologize for.
9758296	9758917	Number three.
9759337	9760037	Number three.
9760437	9760878	Bag.
9761958	9762879	Yay!
9763259	9764160	Please apologize.
9764180	9767422	You can send those cards and letters care of all Bomani players.
9767802	9768142	Bag.
9768402	9769863	Number two, Castlevania 64.
9770744	9771164	Indeed.
9771584	9774666	And you can write that to all of America for Castlevania 64.
9774706	9775187	Apologies.
9775587	9779149	Number one thing that Konami needs to apologize for is...
9780808	9781850	Fuck Impolitary.
9784313	9785956	By quite a bit of a margin, should I add.
9785976	9787458	She seems like she's being fucked.
9788199	9790162	That's why she keeps going off key and rhythm.
9791163	9791484	Alright.
9793075	9795257	Moving on, now let's announce the winner of the cage match.
9795777	9798059	Cage match had a lot of votes tonight, you guys.
9798099	9801302	I'm very happy, and it was actually kind of close.
9801542	9802723	I was very surprised.
9803104	9804965	Votes spread all across the board.
9805386	9807568	I have a whiff today.
9808028	9808989	Okay, Mr. Spanky.
9811271	9812232	So, here it is.
9812552	9818017	The winning song of this week's cage match was... was Silent.
9823908	9826109	What a wonderful world wins the cage match this week.
9826129	9827690	I'm full of happy feelings right now.
9827911	9830612	So, enjoy.
9830953	9832714	Now, let's see.
9834035	9835836	We're going to plug stuff.
9835936	9838558	So, first thing we want to plug, there's tournaments we have to plug.
9839598	9840459	In two weeks...
9841673	9845375	We will be broadcasting live from March Madness.
9845655	9846875	It's going to be a huge tournament.
9847376	9849757	DDR Freestyle Idol is a part of that.
9849817	9851718	PA, 64 person bracket.
9851758	9855099	So even if you suck at PA, come because you're going to qualify.
9855139	9856620	With 64 people, that's awesome.
9856740	9860702	Not to mention, I think the first NorCal 2DX tournament, right?
9861357	9862298	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9876957	9880179	We'll be broadcasting live both days, all day long.
9880880	9881640	So that's something else.
9882701	9886803	Join us in the channel and all that fun stuff.
9887083	9894067	Another tournament we're going to be at in May, and I'm sure I've already gotten private messages asking me to plug this, so I'll get to those in a little bit.
9894507	9896568	But B3, going to be huge.
9896709	9902672	Pier 39, two days, I believe it's May, and I'm going to get killed if it's the wrong date, but I'm going off the top of my head.
9902692	9903492	May 17th and 18th?
9903532	9903712	Yes?
9904013	9904193	Yes?
9904913	9907595	I'm going to look at a calendar because I think I might be wrong.
9908095	9909716	I have this really bad feeling I'm wrong.
9909776	9911798	But I'm sure somebody asked me to plug it anyway.
9912098	9912518	Oh, I'm right.
9912558	9913439	It is 17th and 18th.
9913479	9913719	Woohoo!
9914139	9916681	Okay, so we'll be broadcasting live from there too.
9917222	9921885	And then Season 3 of Orange Lounge Radio starts also in May.
9921985	9926548	And that's going to be a big deal because we have a new toy that we're going to be bringing with us.
9926848	9929890	We can't say anything about it because we don't know for sure we're going to have it yet.
9930130	9931071	But we're trying very hard.
9931531	9936653	And we're going to have a lot more wonderful interaction with audio-wise.
9936733	9942354	We're going to hook the hell out of TVs hooked up to the sound system and other things.
9942374	9946216	We're going to get to play porn on air and all that wonderful stuff.
9946236	9947136	It's going to be very interesting.
9947276	9950937	Also, the other thing that's going to be different about Season 3 is that we're going to have a much larger studio.
9951637	9952097	Oh, hell yeah.
9952117	9953338	So that should be interesting, too.
9955218	9956779	Hopefully we won't all suffocate to death.
9959332	9961955	Okay, so let's see what the chat room wanted us to plug.
9962295	9965998	Because they do this on late night talk shows, you know, they get to plug whatever they want when the guests come on.
9966058	9968160	So, is there anything in here anyone would like to plug?
9968200	9969582	It doesn't even have to be Vimani related.
9969622	9970362	Something you want to plug.
9970603	9971423	Do you need a date?
9971724	9972525	Do you need money?
9972825	9980532	As always, of course, it's going to be www.willddr4food.net slash leechfromloki.
9980732	9981573	Can't forget that.
9981913	9982354	Tomorrow...
9982874	9984075	There will be an update.
9984315	9986737	A couple hundred files will be coming up online.
9987237	9988818	It's going to be the official stuff.
9989238	10008151	Right now we've got prepped most of DDR Extreme, all of DDR First through Fifth Mix, DDR Solo, and I'm going to try to get Max and Max 2 done tonight as well as the other smaller ones like Oha and all those.
10008471	10010072	I think I should be able to get those done tonight.
10010292	10010713	We'll see.
10011213	10012354	So those will be coming out tomorrow.
10015643	10016824	Anybody else want to plug something in here?
10019466	10020386	I need sex!
10022328	10028272	And if they want to fuck the shit out of you, where should they email?
10028292	10034536	916-GO-CHEAP Or just look for them on the corner of 27th and J?
10034556	10042982	1-900-FUCK-ASS Alright, let's go through the chatroom and see what they want to plug.
10044664	10068442	Justin Circuit would like us all to pay a visit to www.saifam.com So Justin Circuit is plugging Saifam, good Brack2000 would like to plug this site, www.capting.tk And I'm a little scared plugging sites I know nothing about So let's go visit it while Jamie plugs her thing
10069699	10070059	No!
10071821	10076824	I would also like to plug Wil Wheaton.net, just because Wil Wheaton's freaking hilarious.
10077384	10078825	And that's one L, not two.
10079986	10081667	Wil Wheaton.net is a hilarious site.

10100997	10102298	Thank you, sorry.
10102318	10105079	23rd Magus says he would like to plug and chug www.unglued.tk
10119276	10121317	or ungluedbomani.tk.
10121357	10126678	I'm not sure if they're two different sites or the same site, but visit them both, unglued.tk and ungluedbomani.tk.
10127119	10129059	Fear some more and fear him the most.
10130400	10130920	That's alright.
10131360	10135201	And they're having a cake versus pie argument in the chat room right now.
10135481	10137242	Quick, quick everybody, cake or pie?
10137862	10138182	Pie.
10138582	10138942	Cake.
10139062	10140443	Cake.
10140703	10140443	3.14.
10142503	10142883	Cake.
10143344	10143864	I say pie.
10145004	10145544	But you know what?
10145624	10147365	Cheesecake owns them both.
10147385	10147645	I like
10148923	10150044	I like cake better than pie.
10150564	10151964	Cheesecake owns them both.
10152124	10152725	End of story.
10153805	10154405	Ice cream cake.
10157727	10158487	Cake pie.
10159847	10161568	Yes, cake flavored pie.

10169815	10171716	I want an erotic cake for my birthday.
10172036	10174376	No, just like in the end of that Simpsons episode.
10175017	10175957	A cake with boobies?
10176157	10178958	My dad, for his 50th birthday, had a boobie cake.
10179258	10184939	And it was a couple of big boobs that was a cake, and then it had like a little bra on it, and it had a skier skiing down one of the boobs.
10185420	10186260	Oh, slopes.
10186400	10189061	Anyway, okay, enough of cake versus pie, we're done.
10189541	10189801	Alright.
10190601	10194303	AZHP wants us to plug NBOR3.
10194863	10196483	Very good opportunity.
10196503	10198004	I try to plug these occasionally.
10198044	10201125	We all try to talk about our forums, but not enough people are going there.
10201145	10202486	You need to visit our forums.
10202846	10207188	They're at KaliBamani.com slash NBOR3.
10207528	10208068	Or you know what?
10208148	10212430	Even quicker, just go to KaliBamani.com and then click on forums.
10213190	10213470	Awesome.
10213731	10216252	Or go to the Orange Lounge website and click on forums.
10216272	10217033	They go to the same place.
10217313	10218034	Visit the forums.
10218134	10218414	Post.
10218434	10219635	They're the best damn forums anywhere.
10220035	10220576	They're good.
10220836	10223037	Except for the Gold Club Center Volts forums, which are better.
10223558	10224198	Oh my gosh.
10224218	10225920	That's a strip club, by the way.
10228161	10229841	I would also like to plug Neopets.com.
10229881	10232222	Go there, earn lots of Neopoints, and give them to me.
10258112	10265157	Snub Dysphenoid would like to say, Paranoid Survivor Max Oni Steps has a max combo of 641 and has slides inside the final runs.
10265457	10266898	How the hell can anyone pass that?
10266938	10268339	Just thought I would share slash ask.
10268620	10270141	This is not Ask Orange Lounge.
10270361	10271582	Yeah, this isn't Ask Orange Lounge, sorry.
10274642	10279247	Because slowly over time, playing DVR, you will slowly become Asian.
10280529	10285374	Once you've achieved the ultimate Asian status, you will be able to pass that song.
10285955	10289539	But only then will you be able to pass that song, and not before then.
10289920	10291602	The machine must choose you.
10292463	10294405	Then, you'll become the last starfighter.
10296434	10299777	Japanman wants me to plug a site that's like a two-year-old internet joke.
10299837	10302198	So when you find something funny that's new, let me know.
10303039	10304660	Because Goatse is like two years old.
10305161	10308964	Okay.
10309444	10313067	DarkTetsuya says that look out for his DWI for Love and the Angel.
10313127	10313827	It's in the making.
10314788	10316770	And will he be hosting that on Leach from Loki?
10316850	10317250	Who knows?
10317690	10318111	I hope so.
10320452	10321633	Yeah, that's another thing about my site.
10321673	10323675	Pretty soon it's going to be really easy to upload files.
10323955	10325216	Like really, really, really easy.
10325656	10326337	So, yeah.
10328849	10334592	Okay, MoreThanJake543 says, I need someone to do something that will make Rio shut down for a day.
10334632	10335232	That's his school.
10336453	10338254	Oh, RateMyHuck.com.
10339134	10342316	Uh-oh, I'm scared to know what a huck, I don't know what a huck is.
10342856	10343636	Let's see what a huck is.
10344917	10346538	I don't know, let's find out, I hope so.
10346638	10350239	Let's see, we're going to RateMyHuck.
10350900	10351940	Oh, I wonder if it's vomit.
10352040	10353281	Huck kind of sounds like vomit.
10355402	10357924	No, because I'm going to rate my huck.
10357984	10358424	Here it is.
10358524	10360145	It's a Norwegian thing.
10360525	10362666	If this is poop or something, I'm going to be pissed.
10364247	10365028	Oh, it's biking.
10365148	10365468	Okay.
10365868	10366169	Okay.
10367209	10368130	Okay, that I can do.
10368430	10369090	That I can deal with.
10369150	10372132	Rate my... Do they have ratemycock.com?
10372913	10375394	This is like a bicycle thing.
10375434	10376275	Okay, that's fine.
10376995	10378076	Rate my huck is acceptable.
10378096	10379116	See if they have rate my cock.
10379357	10379997	Rate my cock?
10380057	10380697	Okay, let's see.
10382218	10383139	I'm curious about this.
10385379	10386500	RateMyCock.com.
10386540	10386960	We're going.
10388001	10388842	Loading, loading, loading.
10389643	10390343	Something's happening.
10390363	10391464	Something's happening.
10391544	10392084	Oh, shit.
10392105	10392225	Uh-oh.
10393285	10393806	I don't know, you guys.
10393826	10395467	It's probably trying to put a virus on my computer.
10397349	10398069	Okay, let's see.
10398109	10398630	We're going to enter.
10403093	10405515	There is a RateMyCock.com.
10406356	10408097	Yeah!
10410159	10410940	What do you guys think?
10412081	10414743	I still think that the penis is the funniest looking thing in the world.
10415427	10416988	Praise God for internet porn.
10418049	10420770	I would give that, oh, I'd say about a five on size.
10421931	10422371	Style?
10423352	10424373	No, okay, I'll give it a seven.
10424853	10425353	And style?
10425413	10426294	Style's a little funky.
10426314	10427175	Let's give it a five.
10427915	10429496	Okay, let's go to the next cock.
10429556	10430257	Let's look at the next one.
10430337	10433238	Okay, we're going to look at one more cock, then we're done.
10434639	10435400	Cock's name.
10436260	10437721	Oh my God!
10437741	10439482	They have their name, and then they have the cock's name.
10439502	10439983	Oh my God!
10441484	10442264	Oh, I want him.
10443505	10444766	Dude, give that a ten all the way.
10445367	10445687	Okay.
10446508	10448570	You have to log in to vote, and I'm not going to log in.
10449011	10450292	So, there you go.
10450833	10452575	Do you want to rate people's cock?
10452655	10453396	And this is great.
10453776	10457700	The greatest thing about the site, even if you're straight, this is funny, I swear.
10457720	10461804	If you're a straight guy, this is still funny, because it has their name, and then their cock's name.
10461884	10463806	That is so Photoshopped, okay?
10464787	10465228	Okay.
10465788	10466890	God, I hope the neighbors aren't listening.
10467010	10467590	More plugging!
10468556	10474558	Saotome Ranma would like to plug www.starman.net as well as my huge, huge penis.
10475579	10475899	Okay.
10476719	10478100	How many Neopoints do you need, Jamie?
10480141	10483322	I'm actually about 30,000 away from my next bank account.
10483342	10484302	I'll take whatever I can get.
10484462	10488684	My Neopets name is DJ underscore Celica.
10489184	10489625	Okay.
10490545	10497308	Yes, we got a lot of cool new listeners from Starman.net, so go visit them, especially if you like Earthbound, which you should because it was like the greatest Super Nintendo game ever.
10498910	10502351	Uh, 23rmagus would like to plug Pi, American Pie style.
10504512	10508773	We don't need to know about your secret nighttime activities involving Pi.
10509154	10512115	And Rice would like to... This is the greatest site.
10512195	10514195	Okay, in all seriousness, this is the greatest site.
10514255	10515996	Rice is having us plug the greatest site.
10516116	10519377	RYC3 would like us to plug RateMyKitten.com.
10519417	10520477	It is the cutest site.
10520497	10520958	No, let's go.
10520978	10521278	Let's visit.
10521318	10522138	Let's visit.
10522198	10522478	Okay.
10522818	10524419	I should put pictures of Shermie on there.
10524439	10524919	Let's visit.
10525319	10526940	It's pussy that's actually good!
10532020	10533460	I wanna see more kitties!
10533861	10535101	I wanna see more kitties!
10535121	10536061	I wanna see more kitties!
10551704	10554325	Yes, I like doing this just for the sound effects, okay?
10554625	10556346	This is great radio.
10556446	10559908	This Indian's home has dinner all ready for tonight.
10561149	10561669	Okay, okay.
10562089	10563310	One more, just for the sound effect.
10563330	10563670	Here we go.
10563730	10563890	Ready?
10563990	10565050	One more, just for the sound effect.
10570313	10574075	That one looked kind of mean, so it didn't get quite the reaction we were hoping for.
10574115	10574795	Okay, let's try this.
10577456	10578377	Okay, it's getting old.
10578737	10579277	Okay.
10580358	10580618	Okay.
10582815	10583756	Okay, go to this site.
10584596	10585336	All right, Rob.
10585516	10585977	Okay, hold on.
10585997	10591199	I've got to fire up the browser here.
10593100	10595681	This is my cat, who owns all cats.
10596981	10598302	I'm going to post this in the chat room, too.
10598822	10599542	Oh, that's cute.
10599562	10601223	This is Shermie sleeping in a pizza box.
10603804	10606725	Shermie is a big cat.
10606745	10609987	You've got to realize that when this cat is standing up and walking around, it looks like a soccer ball.
10611186	10612027	Thank you for watching!
10638829	10639789	Some of Jamie's toys.
10640510	10644211	And your keyboard maniac controller.
10644611	10647232	Okay, me and my friend were playing Vice City is Placed.
10647272	10647892	Then what happens?
10647912	10651134	He starts firing at some cops when this black man just jumps on the bike.
10652014	10653655	I think he came from this hole.
10654335	10654675	What?
10654935	10657596	So he found a man-whore in Vice City, I guess.
10657616	10658696	It's like some big deal.
10658917	10659217	Huh.
10661558	10662458	That's beautiful.
10662478	10662758	Wow.
10665183	10670289	MoreThanJake would like us to plug CollegeHumor.com and MyCatHatesYou.com.
10671110	10671831	Ooh, the other side of it.
10671871	10672151	Let's see.
10672211	10672872	Let's have a look at it.
10672992	10676437	MyCatHatesYou.com.
10677738	10678659	Has a mean little kitty.
10678800	10680462	Oh, no.
10680522	10681563	I've seen that picture over email.
10681643	10681923	I know.
10681963	10682644	I know about that.
10685060	10686541	Oh, these are all, like, mean cats.
10686821	10687502	Oh, that's a cool one.
10687522	10687742	Okay, okay.
10687962	10689042	This is an awesome site.
10689263	10698428	It's, uh, http dot, or it's actually, um, Maddox, M-A-D-D-O-X dot xmission dot com.
10701150	10701570	Uh, oops.
10701590	10702330	No www.
10702691	10703371	No www.
10705833	10706593	Okay, here we go.
10708154	10709475	The best page in the universe.
10709535	10712437	Oh, is this the one where he rips on the little kid's arm and stuff?
10712457	10713757	Yeah, but there's much more of that.
10713777	10714318	Let's see here.
10715920	10719142	Who would make a better president, Bush or a box of Tic Tacs?
10720303	10720983	That's beautiful.
10721504	10722945	Wait, wait, look at this picture.
10723005	10726627	Oh, here we go.
10730349	10730850	Wonderful.
10731850	10738314	Alright, so I'm going to post that to the chat room if they'd like to check out that little ball of joy.
10739715	10742197	Let's see what Shark Skrull wanted us to plug.
10744645	10746025	I like ramen, I like porn
10767466	10769227	Okay, it is a porn site.
10769607	10769947	Beautiful.
10770447	10774988	I would also like to plug cospa.co.jp, C-O-S-P-A.
10775909	10785772	For any cosplayers, it's a site that sells pre-made cosplay pieces, but also it's very good images on things that you can make for your own costumes.
10785792	10793354	Also, tokyostreets.com, for anyone who's into the whole fruits fashion, has pictures of street fashion in Tokyo.
10793974	10797516	Okay, 23rd Magnus would like a way to plug my BWC.
10798577	10799557	His big white cock?
10799697	10800138	I don't know.
10801138	10801438	Okay.
10802039	10805241	These are the last plugs, you guys, and we're going to end the show, get the final thoughts, end the show.
10805681	10808523	Brack2000 wants to plug EmotionEric.com.
10808623	10810144	Yes, this site is very cool.
10810204	10810624	Thank you.
10810964	10811945	Thank you for plugging this.
10811985	10812805	This is a great site.
10813145	10818068	This is this guy, and all he does is he emotes things.
10818989	10820390	So let me show you, like here.
10820670	10822131	God damn, these fucking pop-up ads.
10823471	10825192	Hold on, Alt-F4, gone.
10825552	10828472	So, let's see, this is the emote icon for love.
10829593	10830273	Aw, isn't that cute?
10830413	10831793	This is the emote icon for drunk.
10833594	10843216	And then we get to, like, kill number three, finding dead body in the trunk, freedom,
10846221	10847941	So emotioneric.com.
10848422	10848722	Great.
10849182	10850502	And then he has pending requests.
10850762	10853043	He also takes requests like Yoga Fire and things like that.
10853903	10855863	Okay.
10855963	10856983	What is the request?
10857063	10858064	Homestar Runner.
10858084	10858644	Rise Princess?
10858884	10859484	Homestar Runner.
10859804	10860204	Yes.
10860224	10860544	Is it that?
10860944	10863385	I'm sure everybody on the internet has seen that already.
10863465	10864505	Late, late, ending late.
10864545	10865145	Yeah, big deal.
10865565	10865905	So what?
10865965	10866465	It's our show.
10868166	10870526	Oh, Kelly Bomani says, I would never go to a site like that.
10870566	10871126	Sean found it.
10871487	10871687	No.
10872347	10872627	Sure.
10872667	10873307	Sure.
10874586	10882396	I want Loki to read on air the article Maddox wrote about vegetarianism for morals on the Maddox.xmission.com.
10891306	10891887	You up for it?
10893148	10895690	I've read all of his articles, so... Where's the vegetarian one?
10896010	10896631	Uh, let me find it.
10896671	10898032	No, no, no.
10898252	10900855	That's the continuity one with Daredevil the movie.
10901055	10902616	Uh, let's see here.
10902636	10905499	Uh, oh, this one's funny too, but I'm not going to read that one.
10905799	10908642	Uh, PETA, Preventing Suffering... Yeah.
10908662	10910343	Wait, that's hate mail, I think.
10910463	10910884	Alright.
10912145	10913066	Uh, that might be the one.
10913086	10913626	Really?
10913666	10913846	Yeah.
10916089	10918030	It's about the guiltless grill and something like that.
10919331	10920532	Make it quick, we gotta end the show.
10920832	10921772	It's a long fucking article.
10921792	10922413	First paragraph.
10922653	10922893	Okay.
10923273	10927675	PETA stands for People Before the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
10927735	10929136	Let's ignore that for a moment.
10929176	10935079	That implies that there exists a universal set of ethics instead of let's focus on the meat of this email.
10935159	10938341	PETA is primarily concerned with preventing suffering of living animals.
10938701	10939161	Oh, really?
10939262	10941583	As opposed to preventing the suffering of dead animals?
10942244	10949970	Good thing they clarified that because I was confused and couldn't infer that they were saying animals that they didn't mean dead animals.
10950430	10951491	Glad we have cleared that up.
10951511	10952071	Let's move on.
10952292	10959938	Anyways, to basically summarize that, he's just telling that more animals get killed in the harvesting of grain than bias.
10960018	10965742	And so what he says is for every one piece of, like, or every steak that they're not going to eat, he's going to eat three.
10967804	10968744	That's awful.
10969645	10970045	Alright.
10972547	10978571	And I'm getting asked to play the second song that JB sent me, which I will do after the show is over.
10978931	10980812	So, let's get to those final thoughts.
10981773	10982433	Guess first.
10982754	10982994	Zero?
10988727	11000434	I guess my final thought is pretty much have as many parties as you possibly can because they're really fun and you can get drunk and you can make an ass out of yourself.
11005117	11007819	I have to say in that motion, ass is good but then so is booze.
11011156	11014838	Um, okay, I don't think you said ass is good and so are boobs.
11015998	11016538	Oh, okay.
11017338	11018219	I'm sorry, let me clarify.
11018519	11020480	Ass is good and so is booze.
11020800	11021540	That's an alcohol.
11022400	11024281	Okay, glad we clarified that.
11025081	11027202	Uh, my final thought, uh, be happy.
11027923	11028603	That's all I gotta say.
11030203	11032584	My final thought is black CD-Rs are really red.
11036486	11036566	Um...
11038422	11039563	Vegetarians suck.
11039583	11041404	You should eat all the meat that's possible.
11041685	11043146	Otherwise, cows go to waste.
11043446	11044406	You care to counter that?
11048649	11049650	That sucked.
11051291	11052992	For those of you who don't know, I am a vegetarian.
11055314	11057775	I don't eat cows or pigs because I don't want a heart attack.
11059056	11060357	I say we just eat the vegetarians.
11061760	11063182	Well, that doesn't make sense.
11063202	11066705	I would be cannibalism.
11066765	11067366	I could go into this.
11067386	11068227	It's just too long.
11069108	11071290	And then we trap your soul and make you watch your body rot.
11071310	11071710	Let's see.
11072491	11073912	Salad or beef!
11075674	11076335	Beef it is!
11076555	11077556	Sausage is always good for me.
11078953	11080354	Stop it with the gay references!
11081735	11083557	Did everybody get to do their final thought except me?
11083817	11087760	Well, I want to know if Loki would kill his own cow to get his beef.
11088381	11093625	Oh, damn, that'd be fun!
11093825	11104174	In reference to that, Dennis Leary did have the best funny, the funniest thing regarding being pro meat eating, and that was, bring out a live cow, I'll carve off what I want and ride the rest home.
11106179	11110003	And if one of the meat eaters had a heart attack and fell over, we'd just throw him in the pit too.
11110083	11111004	More meat for the meat eaters.
11112085	11113227	I wouldn't kill my cow.
11113327	11116510	I would get a guy cow and make them have more cows.
11116711	11117952	And then I would kill them and eat them.
11119033	11119414	Beautiful.
11120415	11123018	My final thought for the day is Kuntai.
11123198	11123578	Good night.
