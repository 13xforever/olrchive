Oh! Message for you sir! Attention!

00:30.000 --> 00:32.300

00:32.300 --> 00:35.300
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

00:35.300 --> 00:36.300
In this episode...

00:41.300 --> 00:43.300
Hey, is any gold down there?

00:43.300 --> 00:45.800
That's the biggest berry I've ever seen, Jingleberry.

00:45.800 --> 00:48.300
What's your favorite security movie?

00:48.300 --> 00:51.300
Showgirls. Absolutely frightening.

00:51.300 --> 00:52.300
What's yours?

00:52.300 --> 00:55.300
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

00:55.300 --> 00:58.300
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

00:58.300 --> 01:04.300
I don't get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!

01:04.300 --> 01:05.300
I know kung-fu.

01:05.300 --> 01:08.300
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:08.300 --> 01:11.300
Why did they have to take the word gay?

01:11.300 --> 01:15.300
No! What I expect for Spanish exposition is handsome.

01:15.300 --> 01:18.300
Hey!

01:18.300 --> 01:19.300
Dark Sakurai.

01:19.300 --> 01:20.300
Shut up!

01:20.300 --> 01:23.300
Where's my gun? This is my boomstick.

01:23.300 --> 01:24.300
Sky.

01:24.300 --> 01:26.300
Come on, girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

01:26.300 --> 01:27.300
Loki.

01:27.300 --> 01:30.800
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex and wait.

01:30.800 --> 01:33.800
What kind of warped human being would find that funny?

01:33.800 --> 01:35.800

04:19.260 --> 04:21.060
I killed twenty so far.

04:21.060 --> 04:25.960
The last time you played Animal Crossing was when Joe was on the show last, I think.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.620
No, it was like a month ago.

04:27.620 --> 04:29.540
Did you like what I did with your house?

04:29.540 --> 04:35.280
I gave you a matching floor and wall and some furniture that went with that set. It's the cabana set.

04:35.280 --> 04:38.260
Like trading spaces.

04:38.260 --> 04:40.200
Have you ever watched that show?

04:40.200 --> 04:44.080
My mom watches that.

04:44.080 --> 04:48.080
They're the best of season one of that stupid show on DVD now. Sad.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.080
I'm waiting for the gay wedding's DVD. That show's the shit.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.080
Oh, God. What?

04:55.080 --> 04:57.080
We're giving a shout-out. Shout-out!

04:57.080 --> 04:59.080
Do shout-outs, Jamie.

04:59.080 --> 05:03.080
Yo! All you people who want shout-outs, yo, I'm just not gonna name anybody.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.080
What's up, Jerry?

05:04.080 --> 05:05.080
Yo.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.080
What's up? Okay.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.080
Anyway, I say we go to a break.

05:08.080 --> 05:13.080
Hello to our chat room. If you want to join our chat room, go to orangelounge.skie.cx and come chat.

05:13.080 --> 05:18.080
and then you should also post in our forums, because our forums have been kind of dead, and we need people to post in them.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.080
Not in the quote forum, my god.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.080
No, not the quote forum.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.080
Whoa, but everything else has been dead.

05:23.080 --> 05:26.080
So we need people to go there and post love letters, if you wouldn't mind.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.080
I need a lot of attention, and so does Jamie.

05:28.080 --> 05:35.080
Jamie likes attention, so go post your love and affection letters to Jamie, and then Loki, tell him what a dick he is.

05:35.080 --> 05:37.080
Jerk.

05:37.080 --> 05:42.080
Tell him you don't appreciate those racial slurs and homophobic comments, and what else has he said on this show?

05:42.080 --> 05:44.080
Yeah, you porn-monger you.

05:44.080 --> 05:49.080
What the hell? I'm like totally opposite from everyone I'm perceiving me as.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.080
Like some crazy racist guy out there.

05:51.080 --> 05:56.080
I should just shave my head and join the Ku Klux Klan and shit, man.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.080
I don't know what the problem is.

05:59.080 --> 06:02.080
You were saying, Loki?

06:02.080 --> 06:04.080
All I have to say is you should have been there last night.

06:04.080 --> 06:07.080
We were playing this game, loaded questions.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.080
And Brad had to answer this question,

06:09.080 --> 06:14.360
What's the problem that you would fix in America and he said well we should get rid of all the I'll just leave the rest

06:14.360 --> 06:16.960
Of your imagination, but he got a lot of stuff thrown at him

06:17.680 --> 06:19.680
All right

06:20.720 --> 06:23.940
Yeah deprivation and now you had a lot to draw we'll talk about drinking

06:23.940 --> 06:28.280
We got to drink I was tired yeah, that stuff's pretty strong. That stuff was weak

06:28.640 --> 06:32.800
No, you wonder what's worse than right? You have what three shots, and you were giggling on the floor rolling around

06:32.800 --> 06:35.520
I feel like stuff that you and you didn't move

06:35.520 --> 06:37.520
I don't have to be drunk to do that.

06:37.520 --> 06:38.520
I don't have to be drunk to do that.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.520
You put peanut butter cups on your head, too.

06:40.520 --> 06:41.520
I put one in your ear.

06:41.520 --> 06:42.520
No, wait, wait, hold on.

06:42.520 --> 06:43.520
I got one thing to say.

06:43.520 --> 06:46.520
You want to know what's worse than writing what was written?

06:46.520 --> 06:49.520
Was being the one who had to read it out loud

06:49.520 --> 06:51.520
and being afraid everyone's going to attack you

06:51.520 --> 06:53.520
instead of the person who wrote it.

06:53.520 --> 06:55.520
Because everyone knew who wrote it.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.520
Who tried to balance this bottle of Smirnoff black on me

06:58.520 --> 06:59.520
while I was sleeping?

06:59.520 --> 07:00.520
Was that you?

07:00.520 --> 07:04.520
That wasn't fun.

07:04.520 --> 07:05.520
Wasn't fun.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.520
I was turned upside down.

07:06.520 --> 07:07.520
Can we go to break now?

07:07.520 --> 07:08.520
Yeah, let's go to break.

07:08.520 --> 07:09.520
Alright, bye.

07:09.520 --> 07:10.520
We'll be back.

07:10.520 --> 07:17.480
Okay, I guess we're going to do one more, because I've got these much better parody

07:17.480 --> 07:21.760
lyrics for Bumblebee than that shit I did a little bit ago, so we're going to do this

07:21.760 --> 07:22.760
one instead.

07:22.760 --> 07:24.960
This comes from DDR Angel and Stressa.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.440
This is much better, so enjoy.

07:27.440 --> 07:51.440
I know I'm going to fuck this up, I apologize, I'm late.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.440
Just a four-sex fantasy

07:58.440 --> 08:01.440
My foot kicks your ass when you walk in the room

08:01.440 --> 08:04.940
I go boom-boom-boom, you go zoom-zoom-zoom

08:04.940 --> 08:08.440
You're my format dead pad, I'm your little friend

08:08.440 --> 08:12.440
I wanna kick your ass until you're dead

08:12.440 --> 08:15.440
I'll shove my foot right up your ass

08:15.440 --> 08:19.440
To help you see it's true

08:19.440 --> 08:22.440
I don't like you, can't you see?

08:22.440 --> 08:25.440
Now get the fuck away from me!

08:26.440 --> 08:29.440
Sweet little Bumblebee, get the fuck away from me!

08:33.440 --> 08:36.440
Sweet little Bumblebee, just a fucks up fantasy!

08:36.440 --> 08:55.680
Fuck you.

09:36.440 --> 09:40.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

10:36.440 --> 10:54.680
I see you how I'm feeling My hustle far away, so clean

10:54.680 --> 10:57.180
Hangin' a dream in the rain

10:57.680 --> 11:00.180
Hangin' a shadow more clear

11:00.180 --> 11:04.180
It's time to say goodnight to my friend

11:04.680 --> 11:06.180
I'm the true love

11:06.680 --> 11:09.180
I'm ready to be happy

11:09.680 --> 11:13.180
It's my time for me to say goodnight

11:13.180 --> 11:15.180
Goodnight for you

11:15.180 --> 11:16.680
You don't have to love me

11:16.680 --> 11:17.680
You can't just leave me

11:17.680 --> 11:19.180
Don't you do that

11:19.180 --> 11:21.180
Goodnight for you

11:21.180 --> 11:23.180
I can't take it over

11:23.180 --> 11:25.860
I don't need anyone

11:31.240 --> 11:33.420
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I kon failing

11:41.140 --> 11:46.800
There's no reason I don't need any of this

11:47.500 --> 11:49.560
I still can't find

11:49.560 --> 11:52.560
But you mustn't need that light

11:52.560 --> 11:56.560
Don't let it in your reality

11:56.560 --> 11:58.560
I'm gonna lose you

11:58.560 --> 12:01.560
Cause I have made up my mind

12:01.560 --> 12:04.560
For it's part of my to say

12:04.560 --> 12:07.560
That that's it for you

12:07.560 --> 12:09.560
You don't have to love me again

12:09.560 --> 12:11.560
To say I'm gonna lose you

12:11.560 --> 12:13.560
That that's it for you

12:13.560 --> 12:15.560
I can't take it no more

12:15.560 --> 12:17.560
I don't want you anymore

12:17.560 --> 12:24.560
I say for you, you don't have to love me, can you say you're going to love me?

12:24.560 --> 12:30.560
I say for you, I can't take you over, I don't want you anymore

12:36.560 --> 12:38.560
I think being is so smart

13:08.560 --> 13:24.560
The Orange Lounge Radio with the Bing Pong Ball!

13:24.560 --> 13:28.560
Yay, we're back!

13:28.560 --> 13:29.560
Yay, we are back!

13:29.560 --> 13:30.560
Did you miss us?

13:30.560 --> 13:31.560
Bork, bork, bork!

13:31.560 --> 13:36.440
Enough of that, Brick, we have bumbled these guys' moisture mixtures just for the fact

13:36.440 --> 13:37.720
that I wanted to annoy Rob with it.

13:37.720 --> 13:41.720
Thank you, by the way, Jamie, for embarrassing me, because I had no idea she was going to be playing that.

13:41.720 --> 13:48.720
And, surprisingly enough, a lot of people in the chat room have not heard that before, and a lot of people want to get an MP3 of that.

13:48.720 --> 13:52.720
I'm not sure I should be advertising this. I find that thing quite embarrassing. I don't know why you guys like it so much.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.720
Who wants it? PM me.

13:54.720 --> 13:57.720
No, I'll tell you. I'll tell you what, even better.

13:57.720 --> 14:03.720
Talk to Stressa. I don't know if he's awake right now or active in chat. I'm not sure. I can't really see the chat room from where I'm sitting.

14:03.720 --> 14:09.320
Jamie's in the chat tonight, but Stressa if you're awake, Stressa has a DWI for it

14:09.320 --> 14:13.340
with the background and steps and the mp3 and everything and it's this really

14:13.340 --> 14:17.520
horrible picture of me doing this, you know I'm doing that pussy eating face

14:17.520 --> 14:26.580
where I'm like making a V with my fingers. Anyway, if you want if you want

14:26.580 --> 14:31.560
DWIs go and ask Stressa who's, is he in chat? He's not even in chat right now is

14:31.560 --> 14:37.260
I guess he's out, but when he's when he's around ask him about it, and I think some other folks might have it

14:37.860 --> 14:41.440
DDR angel I know has it, but she's on vacation right now in Japan

14:42.280 --> 14:47.840
Well, we'll figure we'll find a way for you folks yet. I'm sure Loki will put it up speaking of DW eyes and Loki

14:50.040 --> 14:55.360
Farm pretzels right now man. Oh his mouth is full my bad. Well. How was your week, Jamie?

14:55.360 --> 15:00.760
We'll get back to that. I wish is everybody gonna eat, so I have to just sit here and just talk to myself

15:00.760 --> 15:01.760
How are you Zero?

15:01.760 --> 15:02.760
I'm fine.

15:02.760 --> 15:03.760
Fine.

15:03.760 --> 15:04.760
I have new horses.

15:04.760 --> 15:05.760
You have new horses?

15:05.760 --> 15:06.760
Oh, let's talk about yesterday's trip.

15:06.760 --> 15:07.760
That was fun.

15:07.760 --> 15:08.760
We went to Las Vegas yesterday.

15:08.760 --> 15:09.760
That was fun.

15:09.760 --> 15:12.600
To go play Derby Owner's Crack.

15:12.600 --> 15:15.800
For those that don't know what Derby Owner's Crack is, it's called Derby Owner's Crack,

15:15.800 --> 15:18.960
and it's a game where you race horsies, and it's a lot of fun.

15:18.960 --> 15:23.440
It's like initial D, but horses, but you don't actually ride the horses like you drive the

15:23.440 --> 15:24.440
car.

15:24.440 --> 15:25.440
You just whip them.

15:25.440 --> 15:28.920
You have a big button for your whip, and you just beat your horse to get them to run faster,

15:28.920 --> 15:30.360
and you breed them.

15:30.360 --> 15:33.280
And then if you do well in the races, people give you things.

15:33.280 --> 15:38.060
I have a horse named Polteri, and she gets chicks and pussies.

15:38.060 --> 15:41.560
Every time I win a race, a chick will come to the table, or a cat.

15:41.560 --> 15:44.080
So Polteri gets the chicks and gets the pussy.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.080
What can you say?

15:45.080 --> 15:46.080
Hi.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.080
We're doing a show.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.080
Hi.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.080
Hello.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.080
What's up?

15:50.080 --> 15:51.080
What's going on?

15:51.080 --> 15:52.080
Hey, wait.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.080
Anita, Anita, Anita.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.080
Come back.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.080
Anita, come say hi.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.080
Hi.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.080
Hi, everybody.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.080
How are you?

15:58.080 --> 15:59.080
We don't get women on this show very often, and poor Jamie's starting to...

15:59.080 --> 16:00.080
Hey!

16:00.080 --> 16:02.880
were bitching about this the other day that you're like

16:02.880 --> 16:07.080
i'm the only woman on that whole show

16:07.080 --> 16:10.380
it only takes like a few because women rule

16:10.380 --> 16:15.140
oh is it going to be one of those nights? Every one of us is at least worth a thousand of you

16:15.140 --> 16:18.300
is this going to be one of those nights where it sounds like we're at some like

16:18.300 --> 16:24.000
women's rights march and my vagina is a vortex from which all life

16:24.000 --> 16:27.320
explodes

16:27.320 --> 16:30.860
uh... lastly got orange out

16:30.860 --> 16:34.100
uh... by the way and i did find a site for derby owners club so you can see what the

16:34.100 --> 16:35.680
machine looks like

16:35.680 --> 16:37.380
go to

16:37.380 --> 16:42.660
expert doc dot flex dot com and you'll post that in the chat room won't you i just did

16:42.660 --> 16:43.460
already okay

16:43.460 --> 16:47.480
that is derby owners club

16:47.480 --> 16:51.180
it's very casino like it's very very casino it's purposely looking like that

16:51.180 --> 16:52.020
i made

16:52.020 --> 16:58.220
I made 40 horses, one of them was called This is a Horse, and the other one was called Happy

16:58.220 --> 17:01.180
Bunny which won a bunch of races.

17:01.180 --> 17:07.980
And then I made Hot Petutti, bless my soul, I really love that, rock and roll.

17:07.980 --> 17:12.240
And then Mel and Melody let me use two other horses to breed a horse because I used one

17:12.240 --> 17:14.720
called Vanilla Ice, it was all albino.

17:14.720 --> 17:21.740
And then Saved by the Bell, as in B-E-L-L-E, the front part was black and the back was

17:21.740 --> 17:27.500
white, and I bred a tiger horse. Gold and white with tiger stripes and gold eyes and

17:27.500 --> 17:28.620
a tiger tail and everything.

17:28.620 --> 17:33.820
It looks like a tiger, but it's a horse! What's up with that?

17:33.820 --> 17:36.860
I thought it was going to be a boy, because I've been breeding nothing but boys lately,

17:36.860 --> 17:40.460
and this one was a girl, so I couldn't get the name I originally wanted.

17:40.460 --> 17:44.980
Last week on Orange Lounge, I've been breeding nothing but boys lately.

17:44.980 --> 17:48.980
So I named it Strong Badette.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.060
Very nice.

17:50.060 --> 17:53.260
And my other horse's name is for people who have missed it.

17:53.260 --> 17:54.980
My first horse was Slytherin Chaser.

17:54.980 --> 17:57.820
Because you're a Harry Potter whore.

17:57.820 --> 18:01.940
And then I had, um, I Like Cheese.

18:01.940 --> 18:05.180
And then Hot Man Sex, S-E-C-H-S.

18:05.180 --> 18:07.580
Because the machine will try to censor you.

18:07.580 --> 18:12.100
And then I had, um, Mmm Fajitas.

18:12.100 --> 18:14.380
And Jin Kazama, because I'm a Tekken whore.

18:14.380 --> 18:15.380
Very nice.

18:15.380 --> 18:16.540
I made two new horses yesterday.

18:16.540 --> 18:20.100
I made a horse dedicated to one of my favorite Animal Crossing characters, Elmer.

18:20.100 --> 18:23.020
So I made Elmer the horse, and then I made a horse called Sir Mix-a-Lot.

18:23.020 --> 18:26.260
My next horse I'm gonna make is called Glue Factory.

18:26.260 --> 18:29.620
Glue Factory? Glue Factory. Very nice.

18:29.620 --> 18:35.300
Rob is the funny. I'm just reading that I'm trying to catch up on chat room, so...

18:35.300 --> 18:39.580
Horsey sex is bad, I want to make a law about that. HORSEYS HAVE TO HAVE SEX TOO!

18:39.580 --> 18:42.780
Have you ever seen a horse? No, that's the thing about Derby Owners Club.

18:42.780 --> 18:46.600
ok Derby owners club has this like really explicit birthing scene to it

18:46.600 --> 18:50.200
like when you make when you make a new horse for the first time

18:50.200 --> 18:54.200
they go on a date they send off the horses and they trot off

18:54.200 --> 18:58.000
and then like if they go to a tree and it fades out so you don't have to see

18:58.000 --> 18:58.720
horsey sex

18:58.720 --> 19:02.240
but in the next scene is like them in a stable and then like you see the male

19:02.240 --> 19:03.780
horse like you know being all like

19:03.780 --> 19:07.080
nurturing or whatever. The male horse is there kinda lookin

19:07.080 --> 19:12.280
the male horse is just kinda lookin. No the mare is laying down. All I know is that you see the

19:12.280 --> 19:15.300
female horse and all of a sudden it looks like she's gonna take a giant crap

19:15.300 --> 19:22.380
and then all of a sudden there's a little baby I swear to God that's what I saw

19:22.380 --> 19:28.200
no yes yes thank you the mare is laying down and the foal is laying beside her and the

19:28.200 --> 19:32.640
foal gets up and goes you know it's like suddenly there's another horse and then

19:32.640 --> 19:37.880
suddenly it's an adult oh then my happy bunny is still childish that horse sure

19:37.880 --> 19:42.420
looks like mister garrison

19:42.420 --> 19:44.320
i would not want to be mister

19:44.320 --> 19:47.200
the chat rooms referencing a movie called freddy got finger which i never

19:47.200 --> 19:49.000
bothered to watch

19:49.000 --> 19:52.680
because you have to explain to me because uh...

19:52.680 --> 19:56.480
i've ever found tom green funny i don't know if it's just me but

19:56.480 --> 19:58.920
he masturbates a horse

19:58.920 --> 20:02.600
so that i could do it but i can do it but i can do it

20:02.600 --> 20:05.520
really a comedy

20:05.520 --> 20:09.040
but anyway that site that I just linked in the chat room

20:09.040 --> 20:12.720
there are screen captures of a... see look, there's the mayor

20:12.720 --> 20:16.960
and there's the free component. I swear to god I had one where the chick was squatting

20:16.960 --> 20:18.400
and then out comes baby

20:18.400 --> 20:21.560
that is not what happened to me. It's a hit and I got an Easter egg

20:21.560 --> 20:26.080
boy was it, boy was it ever an egg

20:26.080 --> 20:28.560
okay chat room look at this, does that look

20:28.560 --> 20:31.520
like the mayor is giving birth? No.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.920
it's a vicious lie that's photoshopped

20:33.920 --> 20:39.420
Although, one thing that's in here that makes me a little bit wondering, is there's a picture of the horse walking on a path.

20:39.420 --> 20:44.420
That's the one, okay, there's, uh, the exercises you can do to the horse, there's one where you can rest it.

20:44.420 --> 20:51.420
The item all the way on the right is just, like, rest your horse, and it goes on a trot through the forest, and it's like, your horse is relaxing.

20:51.420 --> 20:53.420
So where'd you get attacked by a bear and dies?

20:53.420 --> 20:54.420
Hey!

20:54.420 --> 20:56.420
Now that would be cool!

20:56.420 --> 20:59.420
Is it true that there's a Derby Owners Club 2 coming out?

20:59.420 --> 21:01.920
Um, yeah, let me find the site again. Someone hold the microphone.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.600
okay

21:04.600 --> 21:07.520
hi any else you ever played to be on the track

21:07.520 --> 21:09.160
nobody else

21:09.160 --> 21:10.680
i have four horses

21:10.680 --> 21:12.200
i've got

21:12.200 --> 21:13.740
is doing

21:13.740 --> 21:17.200
i got uh... i have a horse called mister stanky

21:17.200 --> 21:18.980
uh... i know to be a

21:18.980 --> 21:21.320
character from the era easy

21:21.320 --> 21:23.920
uh... that one called big black

21:23.920 --> 21:25.240
which was that

21:25.240 --> 21:30.840
it was a inside joke on the show so uh... i have that and then i've got uh...

21:30.840 --> 21:34.680
one called uh...

21:34.680 --> 21:35.640
and i've got one

21:35.640 --> 21:37.580
i've got one called cloud

21:37.580 --> 21:39.360
and that was the uh...

21:39.360 --> 21:41.340
that was the one i stole from the little girl

21:41.340 --> 21:43.100
and then uh...

21:43.100 --> 21:45.320
uh... was it

21:45.320 --> 21:50.240
loki is not lying he did steal that card from a little girl

21:50.240 --> 21:51.640
she had another one too

21:51.640 --> 21:52.920
i can't was called

21:52.920 --> 21:56.820
that's why all the kids run across the panels

21:56.820 --> 22:01.820
They're just stupid, those kids, but I'll go into them later.

22:01.820 --> 22:02.940
Okay.

22:02.940 --> 22:05.400
I want to talk about what pissed me off yesterday, though.

22:05.400 --> 22:09.000
This kind of goes into that view of the week, but not really.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.220
Because this is video game related. Okay.

22:11.220 --> 22:12.380
The Derby Owners Club,

22:12.380 --> 22:14.620
the way it works is you have one giant monitor,

22:14.620 --> 22:18.020
and there's eight little stations that you can sit at to play, so theoretically eight

22:18.020 --> 22:19.620
people can play the game at once.

22:19.620 --> 22:24.100
And if you visited the website that was given out in the chatroom, you saw a picture, so you know what I'm talking about.

22:24.100 --> 22:27.260
Well, at Milpitas Golf Land on a Saturday, it's pretty busy, so there's a lot of people

22:27.260 --> 22:28.940
that kind of want to play, and it's kind of full.

22:28.940 --> 22:33.220
Well, you know, so I'm sitting there kind of waiting, I'm waiting for a game, and there's

22:33.220 --> 22:37.320
freaking people just sitting there at the stations not doing anything, and they're just

22:37.320 --> 22:40.680
like, they just have all their crap there, and they're dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, and like,

22:40.680 --> 22:44.700
you can try and like, wave at them, you know, go, hi, I want to play, and they just totally

22:44.700 --> 22:45.700
ignore you.

22:45.700 --> 22:46.700
They're totally oblivious to you.

22:46.700 --> 22:48.460
Some of the people there were actually waiting on particular races.

22:48.460 --> 22:51.260
And see, I think that, personally, I think that's bullshit.

22:51.260 --> 22:58.260
If you're going to do that, where you're just going to sit on the game and wait for particular races, you need to do that on weeknight when no one's there.

22:58.260 --> 23:03.260
You need not do that on the middle of a Saturday. So, poo on you, you derby squatters.

23:04.260 --> 23:08.260
I guess that's happened to me with Initial D before.

23:08.260 --> 23:17.260
It's the difference between having two, where there's big lines of people, and then one with eight terminals, and people are just sitting there.

23:17.260 --> 23:20.260
There's a difference between Initial D and Derby Owners Club.

23:23.260 --> 23:25.260
You haven't even played the horsey guy.

23:41.260 --> 23:44.260
Ooh, you got admonished, Mr. Loki.

23:44.260 --> 23:49.260
Ninja Usagi-Koi says bad stealing from kids.

23:49.260 --> 23:50.260
Ninja Usagi-Koi.

23:50.260 --> 23:56.260
Well, I didn't technically steal it. She was dumb and left it there, so I took it.

23:56.260 --> 24:00.260
Okay, taking advantage of other people's stupidity is okay.

24:00.260 --> 24:05.260
Should we actually try to have FUs of the week?

24:05.260 --> 24:09.260
Loki wanted to actually talk about something Bamani, so I'm going to figure I'll give him...

24:09.260 --> 24:15.260
I'm going to give them a chance to present a Bomani-related topic, and we'll all talk about it and see how long that lasts.

24:15.260 --> 24:16.260
Have fun.

24:16.260 --> 24:22.260
Alright. Well, obviously, there's Poppy Music 8 is coming out for the home version.

24:22.260 --> 24:25.260
Hey, there's people that play Poppy Music, so shut the hell up.

24:25.260 --> 24:27.260
Yeah, I play Poppy Music 8.

24:27.260 --> 24:38.260
Okay, Poppy Music 8 is coming out, and it's going to be, they've estimated that it's going to have over 100 songs on it, plus a new mode that's called Live Mode, which has something to do with these live videos of them playing.

24:38.260 --> 24:43.340
I don't know what the fuck it is. I don't play pop music. I played it once and I didn't like it, so there.

24:43.340 --> 24:46.700
Yeah, great. Where's 2DX7's style?

24:46.700 --> 24:52.700
Why do they keep cranking out the pop music? Hello! 2DX7's style has already been announced.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.620
When? When? I thought it was coming out in April.

24:54.620 --> 24:57.900
I think that's just a rumor. Whatever.

24:59.900 --> 25:02.380
We're going to research this a little bit.

25:02.380 --> 25:06.700
You know, I should really pay attention to all this news since I read it all the time.

25:06.700 --> 25:10.720
pop music it's okay i mean i like it it's cool and i think backing reason a

25:10.720 --> 25:14.260
lot of people like it a lot seriously is because

25:14.260 --> 25:18.560
they don't have it many places so like having played it is like a special club

25:18.560 --> 25:21.560
like your leader if you play pop music or whatever

25:21.560 --> 25:25.340
problem is is going on and i have some good tunes makes me freaking hands hurt

25:25.340 --> 25:26.780
my politics rebel

25:26.780 --> 25:29.640
aerobics revolution

25:29.640 --> 25:32.400
uh... land and next year for the uh...

25:32.400 --> 25:36.160
the japanese home version max to

25:36.160 --> 25:39.640
oh i'm sorry i'm sorry uh... matt the uh... ice princess has a question arms

25:39.640 --> 25:40.600
and ice queen

25:40.600 --> 25:44.120
all that you have to speak in the mike signal

25:44.120 --> 25:47.160
all right so why don't you go ahead and enlighten all of us idiots out here who

25:47.160 --> 25:51.320
don't know what the hell you're talking about when you talk about pop music

25:51.320 --> 25:53.560
i'll let you do it

25:53.560 --> 25:55.040
music like to the x

25:55.040 --> 25:56.940
we have big buttons around

25:56.940 --> 26:00.360
you know it's not like this you've got the uh... buttons big round buttons

26:00.360 --> 26:01.340
and you just

26:01.340 --> 26:05.680
and yelling trouble yes it's like non problematic bubbles to get into music

26:05.680 --> 26:07.680
That's an excellent way of describing it. Thank you, Bombay.

26:07.680 --> 26:14.680
It's almost like if you were to take 2DX and turn it into a Saturday morning cartoon, that's what it would be.

26:14.680 --> 26:18.680
It's all nice and stuff, but it's still kind of difficult like 2DX.

26:18.680 --> 26:23.680
And they have pop and stage, which looks like pump it up with buttons.

26:23.680 --> 26:26.680
But yeah, pop and music is pretty popular.

26:26.680 --> 26:28.680
They have a pretty good selection of music.

26:28.680 --> 26:32.680
I mean, hello, Daikin and Ty. That's a really popular song on DDR Extreme and stuff.

26:32.680 --> 26:35.680
and people are like, oh, hey, whoa, there's actual good music in there?

26:35.680 --> 26:37.680
Overplay!

26:37.680 --> 26:39.680
Yeah.

26:39.680 --> 26:44.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But still, there's a lot of stuff on pop music that no one's really heard of.

26:44.680 --> 26:48.680
I mean, pop music even has a Star Trek theme. Hello, that's pretty funny.

26:48.680 --> 26:53.680
But yeah, that's pretty much what it is.

26:53.680 --> 27:00.680
It's like 2DX, they've got some weird shit, weird modifiers on there and stuff, but it's pretty much like 2DX.

27:00.680 --> 27:03.960
And it's more like happy and rainbowy and gay because like the buttons are these big

27:03.960 --> 27:05.960
right yeah I knew that would make you cheer.

27:05.960 --> 27:09.800
Yeah it's got these big like red and yellow and blue and green buttons and they all flash

27:09.800 --> 27:13.560
and little things that fall it's falling pancakes that's what they look like they're big falling

27:13.560 --> 27:17.260
pancakes that have big eyes on them they go hi meet me and then you hit the button when

27:17.260 --> 27:22.280
they hit the blind and they go oh excellent.

27:22.280 --> 27:25.640
But like sometimes you have to hit four buttons at once so you're playing the game like this

27:25.640 --> 27:28.280
with your elbows.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.280
Well, that's good radio. No one can see that.

27:30.280 --> 27:32.280
I know. Okay.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.280
You all did, though. Imagine...

27:34.280 --> 27:36.280
Imagine doing the Tran dance in the stoic video.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.280
That's kind of like what playing some popin' music is.

27:41.280 --> 27:42.280
Anyways...

27:42.280 --> 27:45.280
And the only place I know of anywhere that has popin' music...

27:45.280 --> 27:47.280
I think they have a machine in Portland.

27:49.280 --> 27:50.280
Yes, Bombay.

27:50.280 --> 27:53.280
Yeah, I found one in Orange County, actually.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.280
At Camelot Golf Land.

27:55.280 --> 27:56.280
And...

27:56.280 --> 27:57.280
Oh, I'll be damned!

27:57.280 --> 27:58.280
In Orange County.

27:58.280 --> 27:59.280
That's the one near Disneyland.

27:59.280 --> 28:00.280
Camelot.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.280
Yeah, CMGO.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.280
It's pretty tight.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.280
I didn't get a chance to play.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.600
There was actually a lot of people playing, so.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.120
And then, of course, AI has one.

28:06.120 --> 28:08.280
They have Pop Music 9, which I did get to play when I was down there.

28:08.280 --> 28:09.280
Well, yeah.

28:09.280 --> 28:12.600
When we went down there, they had that shitty M-whatever-that-is-stupid anime low.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.600
See, now that's one of Jamie's favorites.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.240
That one sucked ass.

28:16.240 --> 28:21.120
If you like anime, it's gonna have all the songs you like in it.

28:21.120 --> 28:24.080
Mambo Go-Go was, like, better than that.

28:24.080 --> 28:25.080
Leave me alone.

28:25.080 --> 28:35.920
I can't pronounce shit tonight, leave me alone.

28:35.920 --> 28:39.640
But uh, yeah, um, let's see here.

28:39.640 --> 28:43.480
Other than that, you know, just like, it's just a lot of home versions coming out, pretty

28:43.480 --> 28:47.280
much everyone's waiting for Max 2 to come out, as uh, we talked about that a little

28:47.280 --> 28:49.000
bit last week, and then there's Aerobics Revolution.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
I'm so moist from excitement about Max 2.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
That no one gives a shit about.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
Have they figured out if there's going to be anything special in it yet?

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Have they announced any features or anything like that?

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
They announced how many songs they're supposed to be.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
How many? How many?

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
I don't remember!

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
It's like 60 or 70.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
You're fired.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
You don't do anything.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Loki, you're supposed to remember these things.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
Yeah, when I'm busy running a couple sites and doing shit for my work.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
Listen, my job on this show is to be cute, and I fulfill that.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
So, what's your job? Bring us news.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Are you bringing us news?

29:22.000 --> 29:24.340
fuck

29:24.340 --> 29:25.640
that's messed up man

29:25.640 --> 29:31.640
you're bringing us like half the news you're like msnbc jesus

29:31.640 --> 29:33.800
okay

29:33.800 --> 29:37.680
no on microsoft no

29:37.680 --> 29:38.560
try think

29:38.560 --> 29:44.480
i don't really know much about that and i have like gossip news okay

29:44.480 --> 29:49.140
as reported on the air mania acts in one of their like random topic things

29:49.140 --> 29:49.980
money ruler

29:49.980 --> 29:56.980
backgrounds, he didn't make them. He stole them. Gossip! Oh my god! So who did? Who cares?

29:57.200 --> 30:02.180
Who did? Who did? He just got them off some sites. It doesn't really matter. So like he

30:02.180 --> 30:07.400
downloaded the artwork and just added the text or what? Yeah, pretty much. That doesn't

30:07.400 --> 30:11.560
make sense though, because like, a lot of the backgrounds, at least the ones I saw had

30:11.560 --> 30:15.520
some really elaborate text to them, so it's not like somebody just went and laid down

30:15.520 --> 30:26.520
I've never been to, like, um, there's a bunch of art sites out there that people do, um, you know, the digital cultures or whatever like that, but, um, ooh.

30:26.520 --> 30:35.520
So, um, yeah, but who really gives a shit? I mean, I thought, I thought you didn't, I thought for whatever reason you had a grudge against him or something and you, you would have liked that news.

30:35.520 --> 30:37.520
I don't have a grudge against him.

30:37.520 --> 30:39.520
I do not have a grudge against him!

30:39.520 --> 30:43.520
The only thing I was saying was that his step files are too hard.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.520
You cannot possibly play them on the feet.

30:45.520 --> 30:49.520
I mean, try playing stoic on a pad that's like...

30:49.520 --> 30:51.520
Hot living is not a ham.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.520
You're hot living, whatever.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.520
No, I'm just talking...

30:55.520 --> 30:56.520
It's just...

30:56.520 --> 30:57.520
I don't know, his stuff's hard.

30:57.520 --> 31:00.520
I don't like it. Everyone calls it four-key beatmania.

31:00.520 --> 31:02.520
Yeah, I'd say that's pretty accurate.

31:02.520 --> 31:03.520
But, um...

31:03.520 --> 31:09.520
So wait, how do you get news like that? So a site actually ran a news story saying,

31:09.520 --> 31:12.520
guess what? Actually it was a forum post, so...

31:12.520 --> 31:17.520
Oh, it was a forum post. I thought it was like front page. I'm like, that's pretty sad.

31:17.520 --> 31:22.520
You know it's a slow news day when the front page news is, uh-uh, bitch didn't do his own art.

31:22.520 --> 31:29.520
Who gives a shit anyways? It's like, art isn't really a big- well yeah, it makes your file look nice,

31:29.520 --> 31:32.020
It has nothing to do with the steps at all.

31:32.020 --> 31:34.020
And I think the only thing was just because he's...

31:34.020 --> 31:37.520
Maybe, okay, maybe because Turnimix, they insisted that you make your own backgrounds, right?

31:37.520 --> 31:40.520
And didn't he, wasn't he a judge for that?

31:40.520 --> 31:41.520
I don't know.

31:41.520 --> 31:46.020
Well, he was a judge in the last one, but whatever.

31:46.020 --> 31:52.520
Well, I invite him for an interview on this show to clear the air, if he or any of his cohorts are listening.

31:52.520 --> 31:58.020
I don't really even know what half the story is, because obviously I'm only reporting half the story since that's what she said.

31:58.020 --> 32:02.100
I don't even know I just think I think he might have been claiming that he did all the artwork

32:02.740 --> 32:06.020
Instead of just saying hey, I got this from here. I had the text done

32:06.020 --> 32:10.940
I mean if that's if he just came forward and said that everything would be fine. That's all this but

32:11.380 --> 32:16.580
Yeah, it was really fucking slow as far as nudes goes. There's nothing. You know what I want him on the show

32:16.580 --> 32:20.580
How can we make that happen? I want to get him on the show and have him explain what happened

32:20.580 --> 32:25.720
That's never gonna happen. So isn't that your job, you know getting guests on the show. I'll see what I can do

32:25.720 --> 32:27.720
I thought we were going to fucking happen.

32:27.720 --> 32:29.720
It doesn't matter.

32:29.720 --> 32:31.720
Who cares?

32:33.720 --> 32:35.720
So what's coming up?

32:37.720 --> 32:39.720
What's 4.15?

32:39.720 --> 32:45.720
According to Bi-Rite, I beat many of CDX7's styles coming out on April 15th of 2003.

32:45.720 --> 32:49.720
But Bi-Rite is a shitty ass place to order games from anyway.

32:49.720 --> 32:53.720
Because they cheated me with my Tekken 4 and they suck and need to die.

32:53.720 --> 33:00.280
Bitter are we? Bitter? Party of one? Your table's ready? Bitter?

33:00.280 --> 33:04.240
I don't bite my ass. But, I mean,

33:04.240 --> 33:09.440
I don't know, if anyone can find any, if anyone can look on Konami's

33:09.440 --> 33:14.020
Japanese site and find me proof that they have something up for BeatMania

33:14.020 --> 33:15.600
TDX7 style to be out and

33:15.600 --> 33:20.160
on home or from any reliable place, send me a PM in the chat room, please.

33:20.160 --> 33:22.160
DarkSakuraSSX

33:50.160 --> 33:52.920
uh... you know you'd be surprised like uh...

33:52.920 --> 33:56.280
all the stuff that i do during the week is that basically my job for those who don't

33:56.280 --> 33:58.000
know i'm entering phones and

33:58.000 --> 34:00.540
talking to people and i have my

34:00.540 --> 34:04.960
i have my internet explorer open all the time you know browsing web pages because we're on T1 and i

34:04.960 --> 34:07.800
download about five hundred megs worth of files every

34:07.800 --> 34:10.300
every week and you know so

34:10.300 --> 34:13.120
that's what i do all day so i read about eight

34:13.120 --> 34:14.940
forums at the same time

34:14.940 --> 34:16.260
all day long

34:16.260 --> 34:19.300
and uh...

34:19.300 --> 34:25.600
You'd think that I would know more what's going on, but really, to be honest, for the last three months, there has been nothing going on in the news.

34:25.600 --> 34:30.400
It's like, our show's just been just kinda like, okay, just find some new shit to talk about.

34:30.400 --> 34:31.900
Ah, nothing there.

34:31.900 --> 34:44.900
So, there really isn't that much going on right now, other than waiting for the home version of Maxu to come, which is probably gonna have, you know, the same rehash shit from DDR, you know, Max USA, which, you know, some of those songs.

34:44.900 --> 34:50.900
But at least we'll be able to make edits for it and maybe a few new songs for Extreme 2 and whatnot.

34:50.900 --> 34:58.900
And then, obviously, probably later on this year, we'll have some news about DDR Extreme 2 and its development and all that stuff.

34:58.900 --> 35:09.900
And then, you know, that kind of stuff. But right now, there's not too much. New Guitar Freaks, obviously, is being, I think, playtested right now.

35:09.900 --> 35:15.900
I want it to be available somewhere else besides like where you know it will go.

35:15.900 --> 35:21.900
Let's talk about Mocap Golf because we just got to NDS and that game looks really fun.

35:21.900 --> 35:32.900
Before we get on the Mocap Golf tangent I just wanted to say I'm looking at BamaniX.com and they have 2DX 7th style coming out in August for the PS2.

35:32.900 --> 35:41.900
So take that will. However, they say that BeatMe is seventh mix plus the finals coming on PS2 and March, but I haven't heard anything about that yet seeing as, hmm, it's March.

35:41.900 --> 35:44.900
Uh, yeah, it's kind of surprising.

35:44.900 --> 35:47.900
My memory serves me right. I think it was the 24th or 25th.

35:47.900 --> 35:52.900
Yeah, I thought I heard that was going to be late March. Yeah, like last week.

35:52.900 --> 35:57.900
Well, gee, Konami of Japan's doing a great job promoting it.

35:57.900 --> 36:01.900
Well, they do a great job with everything. Like, you know.

36:01.900 --> 36:05.900
Now wasn't it supposed to come out, oh I don't know, Christmas Eve last year?

36:05.900 --> 36:11.900
Well, if I remember right, what they said about Christmas Eve was that that was just supposed to be 7th mix for the PS1.

36:11.900 --> 36:15.900
And now they're doing 7th mix plus the final PS2, whatever.

36:15.900 --> 36:18.900
Eh, who cares? Can we get on to boat camp golf now?

36:18.900 --> 36:22.900
And like an open layer to like, frickin', um, Konami.

36:22.900 --> 36:24.900
Why are you ignoring Dead End?

36:24.900 --> 36:28.900
I mean that song back in 3rd mix is a pretty cool song, you haven't remixed it at all.

36:28.900 --> 36:33.220
remix it at all. You've like, remixed the hell out of Trip Machine and Paranoia and

36:33.220 --> 36:35.020
all this be brilliant to you and shit.

36:35.020 --> 36:37.820
I wanna see Dead End in 2DX.

36:37.820 --> 36:39.460
Yeah.

36:39.460 --> 36:41.380
That would be kinda cool.

36:41.380 --> 36:42.420
Alright, Mocap Golf.

36:42.420 --> 36:45.400
Okay, Mocap Golf, yes.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.820
Greatest motion capture game ever.

36:47.820 --> 36:50.900
It is so cool.

36:50.900 --> 36:53.020
It is damn cool, don't say that.

36:53.020 --> 36:56.840
It frickin' rules. Dude, what other game can you hit a golf ball off the top of a

36:56.840 --> 36:57.940
building

36:57.940 --> 36:59.920
onto another one

36:59.920 --> 37:03.440
you'd give a microphone second picture

37:03.440 --> 37:06.680
the only reason it's the only reason i'm mad is because

37:06.680 --> 37:10.480
over at skidio we're supposed to have so colorado already but instead i went

37:10.480 --> 37:12.980
into work today and saw a golf game

37:12.980 --> 37:15.880
now that we will have a bad

37:15.880 --> 37:19.640
i think a lot of other so far she's been out for a while i think i know about

37:19.640 --> 37:21.360
i'm waiting for it like

37:21.360 --> 37:23.520
so he has really

37:23.520 --> 37:27.980
awesome system for it and I'm really excited about it, but he just needs the software.

37:27.980 --> 37:34.720
Okay, yes, broaden your horizons, that's all I need to say. Golf, man, golf!

37:34.720 --> 37:39.000
I like Soulcalibur, but I don't know, I tend to want to play other things now.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.400
You know what game? It's not Golf's Better, it's just Good.

37:42.400 --> 37:45.920
It needs a goodie. The sword game?

37:45.920 --> 37:49.440
It was called in America, Blade of Honor or something.

37:49.440 --> 37:52.440
You can play it in, like, different sword styles and everything, too.

37:52.440 --> 37:53.440
That would be cool.

37:53.440 --> 37:55.440
And, like, you can cut people in half.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.440
And I played it in, um, in Vegas.

37:58.440 --> 37:59.440
Vegas?

37:59.440 --> 38:01.440
Because they actually had the, uh, it's a goodie one.

38:01.440 --> 38:02.440
It was at New York, New York.

38:02.440 --> 38:04.440
I am going there.

38:04.440 --> 38:09.440
But, I, I, I paid four bucks, no, two dollars, four bucks, actually,

38:09.440 --> 38:11.440
to play that game and have a replay.

38:11.440 --> 38:13.440
Because it's Vegas.

38:13.440 --> 38:15.440
No one can hear what you're saying, by the way.

38:15.440 --> 38:21.440
I played it in Orange County and there was only 8 nickels.

38:21.440 --> 38:24.440
Well, there, but I was in Vegas and everything cost more in Vegas.

38:24.440 --> 38:27.440
That was the only place I had ever seen it.

38:27.440 --> 38:32.440
But that game takes mocap golf, bends it over, and says,

38:32.440 --> 38:36.440
Hey, here's a sword. Guess where it is?

38:36.440 --> 38:40.440
Yeah, but usually golf clubs are longer than swords.

38:40.440 --> 38:41.440
Swords hurt more.

38:41.440 --> 38:42.440
They're sharper.

38:42.440 --> 38:46.440
Have you ever been hit with a golf ball before?

38:46.440 --> 38:49.440
Have you ever been anally raped by a sword?

38:49.440 --> 38:52.440
Have you?

38:52.440 --> 38:54.440
I read a lot.

38:54.440 --> 38:56.440
That's all you can come up with? Have you?

38:56.440 --> 38:58.440
Yes, that's all I can come up with right now.

38:58.440 --> 39:00.440
This is like another Dave over here.

39:00.440 --> 39:02.440
I'm like open all night.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.440
Yeah, he's like CCL Dave.

39:04.440 --> 39:07.440
Lightning Dave. I will just OB on the attack all night.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.440
I'm just kidding.

39:09.440 --> 39:10.440
cap golf

39:10.440 --> 39:13.920
and you can play on the beach

39:13.920 --> 39:17.480
and for the record by the way i have been hit with a golf ball in the neck

39:17.480 --> 39:20.320
so yeah

39:20.320 --> 39:21.120
where at

39:21.120 --> 39:22.460
i mean no not

39:22.460 --> 39:27.920
no where is it where is it someone actually hit it

39:27.920 --> 39:32.760
no she threw it at herself into my neck

39:32.760 --> 39:38.120
at themselves in the throat kind of an idiot are you

39:38.120 --> 39:40.120
I'm gonna throw the phone at myself!

39:40.120 --> 39:41.120
Oh!

39:41.120 --> 39:42.120
I'm so mad!

39:42.120 --> 39:44.120
That sounds so likey-dokey.

39:44.120 --> 39:50.120
Rob's drinking nuclear waste.

39:50.120 --> 39:51.120
It's this stuff that, um...

39:51.120 --> 39:52.120
Oh.

39:52.120 --> 39:56.120
This green drink that I'm drinking is Hawaiian Punch Green Blaster.

39:56.120 --> 39:57.120
What's it called?

39:57.120 --> 39:58.120
Something.

39:58.120 --> 39:59.120
It's like...

39:59.120 --> 40:00.120
Hawaiian Punch Greenship flavor.

40:00.120 --> 40:01.120
But they used to, um...

40:01.120 --> 40:05.120
I think they only had it in SoCal and now they have it at the Rob's by my house.

40:05.120 --> 40:06.120
Yes.

40:06.120 --> 40:07.120
It's very nice.

40:07.120 --> 40:09.840
And like, I blame Melody for getting me hooked to that.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.560
I'm gonna share my accomplishment with everyone on the radio here.

40:12.560 --> 40:17.000
I am nine days without soda. I haven't had a soda in nine days, so...

40:17.000 --> 40:19.280
Who's running a 12-step program? Soda drinkers are not a mess.

40:22.280 --> 40:24.280
She crack open a Pepsi. Fuck off.

40:24.560 --> 40:26.000
So yeah, I...

40:26.000 --> 40:28.800
And then now, this is a big deal for me because I usually

40:29.400 --> 40:33.200
have a Mountain Dew in the morning just to wake up, and then like, you know,

40:33.200 --> 40:38.800
I drink like three vanilla cokes when I get home. So it's a pretty big deal. So of course Hawaiian punch

40:38.800 --> 40:43.020
Really isn't that much better for you than soda, but you know, so it's a special day

40:44.720 --> 40:48.360
You know, you know what it's a special day so eat shit

40:51.200 --> 40:52.640
Okay, so

40:52.640 --> 40:55.120
Should we should we take a break for a minute?

40:55.840 --> 40:58.800
Should we take a break for a minute? You want to do the f-use when we come back?

40:58.800 --> 41:06.640
Sure, prepare yourself for the FUs that are coming up when we get back.

41:06.640 --> 41:10.940
If you would like to submit an FU, remember, tonight we're at Jamie's, so don't send them

41:10.940 --> 41:11.940
to me.

41:11.940 --> 41:15.240
You'll see my name in the chat room says I'm out, out in the boot.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.460
So you want to send them to Jamie.

41:16.460 --> 41:20.920
Her nickname is DarkSakuraSSF, so send your FUs of the week to Jamie.

41:20.920 --> 41:23.360
And we'll try to keep it short this week, we promise.

41:23.360 --> 41:25.360
Everybody in the room is going to keep them short tonight, yes?

41:25.360 --> 41:28.200

41:28.200 --> 41:34.920

41:42.920 --> 41:48.240
room and the chat rooms at our website just orange lunch SK ie dot CX and then

41:48.240 --> 41:52.000
click on chat that URL is a little hard to remember I got a much easier one for

41:52.000 --> 41:57.880
you to remember just go to Cali Bamani calm c-a-l-i Bamani calm and we're an

41:57.880 --> 42:03.880
the affiliate of callebomani.com, so they got a link right there on the front page to the radio station.

42:03.880 --> 42:09.880
You should do a TK, uh, like, uh, register a TK, um, you know, one of those.

42:09.880 --> 42:11.880
No.

42:11.880 --> 42:12.880
FINE!

42:12.880 --> 42:14.880
.coms are better!

42:14.880 --> 42:15.880
Yeah, but they cost money!

42:15.880 --> 42:22.880
Actually, yeah, when I get a little more money, I'm gonna purchase a.org on behalf of the station, sir,.com or.org, so we'll be at Orange Lounge Radio or Orange Lounge.

42:22.880 --> 42:25.880
How about.tv? Because all the good websites have.tv.

42:25.880 --> 42:29.160
and then we could say as seen on t-v even though you know we've never been on

42:29.160 --> 42:32.180
t-v well i i was on t-v for understation live

42:32.180 --> 42:35.340

42:37.220 --> 42:39.160

42:39.160 --> 42:43.140

42:52.120 --> 42:57.120

42:57.120 --> 43:01.120
Shit, fuck, damn, cock, pussy.

43:01.120 --> 43:03.120
Cut!

43:03.120 --> 43:08.120

47:45.120 --> 47:46.120
You can't do a race to take that fall

47:46.120 --> 47:48.120
And it's up to you to make that call

47:51.120 --> 47:52.120
You can't drop that ball

47:54.120 --> 47:55.120
You can't drop that ball

47:57.120 --> 47:58.120

Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Can you hear what I'm saying?

49:28.120 --> 49:31.120
Well it's time to take a man and watch him back

49:31.120 --> 49:35.120
I'm gonna kick your ass and beat him, kill him all

49:35.120 --> 49:41.120
Down, what am I gonna do?

49:44.120 --> 49:47.120
Have you ever think of a game like this?

49:47.120 --> 49:49.120
I know it here

49:49.120 --> 50:00.120
Oh, ass!

50:00.120 --> 50:06.520
This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

50:06.520 --> 50:08.080
I'm eating a taquito.

50:08.080 --> 50:11.080
We are eating taquitos.

50:11.080 --> 50:12.080
Taquitos!

50:12.080 --> 50:13.880
I love taquitos.

50:13.880 --> 50:15.520
The official food of Orange Lounge?

50:15.520 --> 50:17.160
I don't know.

50:17.160 --> 50:21.140
thank you uh... ice cream for getting to get to keep us there delicious

50:21.140 --> 50:23.520
i hate them good

50:23.520 --> 50:25.240
that like me

50:25.240 --> 50:26.640
doesn't make you poop

50:26.640 --> 50:31.720
now i just don't like that

50:31.720 --> 50:35.280
their food sucks ass that's what i have against it

50:35.280 --> 50:37.020
but but uh...

50:37.020 --> 50:39.520
look you forgot the water too

50:39.520 --> 50:43.380
but i'm pleasantly surprised that uh... what was it uh...

50:43.380 --> 50:45.240
chevy's they have

50:45.240 --> 50:46.400
hot wings

50:46.400 --> 50:52.000
and they were damn good. That was the only thing I ate last night at Chevy's. Chevy's was damn good fajitas because they had that cornmeal stuff.

50:52.000 --> 50:59.200
For me, I'm allergic to corn, but I will eat that cornmeal stuff like all day. I had them give me an extra thing of it and I did nothing to eat that cornmeal one day.

50:59.200 --> 51:06.200
Um, Amanda, one of the official lesbians of Orange Launch Radio who was here a couple weeks ago, we were at Chevy's the other day and she kept threatening to tell them it was my birthday.

51:06.200 --> 51:11.600
And that got me to thinking, you know, how would the restaurants know? Like, you know, if you go in there every time you eat and tell them it's your birthday,

51:11.600 --> 51:14.600
They'd never know, huh? And you can get, like, free ice cream!

51:14.600 --> 51:17.600
Well, okay, as long as you didn't go to the same Chevy's every week, okay?

51:17.600 --> 51:20.600
Then they'd probably catch on. But you know, if you go a different...

51:20.600 --> 51:23.600
Well, then again, they'd probably, like, keep track of it.

51:23.600 --> 51:25.600
They'd, like, take pictures of you, like...

51:25.600 --> 51:28.600
They don't take pictures! Have you ever seen them snap a camera as they're singing Happy Birthday?

51:28.600 --> 51:31.600
No, they put the sombrero on your head, sing their verse, they leave.

51:32.600 --> 51:35.600
If you don't tip them, then they'll still not know who you are.

51:35.600 --> 51:42.600
That's the thing we should do, just like, send you out to as many places and see how many places you get a birthday at a day.

51:42.600 --> 51:45.600
For like a week, and just see what you can do.

51:45.600 --> 51:47.600
Okay, okay, we can do it.

51:47.600 --> 51:49.600
See how well you can pull that off.

51:49.600 --> 51:52.600
You're the intern though, you have to do the embarrassing stuff. We'll tell them it's your birthday.

51:52.600 --> 51:54.600
I have to do the embarrassing stuff? Oh, thank you.

51:54.600 --> 51:55.600
See, I love my birthday-

51:55.600 --> 51:57.600
And then we'll give me the ice cream.

51:57.600 --> 52:02.600
My birthday kicks ass because I get to be cheerful and everyone's like so sad.

52:02.600 --> 52:08.600
I love it. That was the best gift anyone could give me was the death of thousands and thousands of people on my birthday.

52:14.600 --> 52:20.600
Let's see. Unpolitically correct statement took less than an hour this time into the show. Congratulations.

52:20.600 --> 52:23.600
I think we should get to the fuck yous of the week, right?

52:23.600 --> 52:25.600
Yeah, sure.

52:25.600 --> 52:31.600
Okay, um, well we don't have, we can't play music in the background because my mixer sucks and I need a new sound card.

52:31.600 --> 52:34.600
Anyone wants to give me a new sound card? Thank you.

52:34.600 --> 52:38.600
Anyway, first fuck you of the week goes to my sound card.

52:38.600 --> 52:43.600
I'm sorry, tack you ain't. Okay.

52:43.600 --> 52:47.600
This is fucked up.

52:47.600 --> 52:52.600
Um, also goes toward having no money right now because I'm paying for my car.

52:52.600 --> 52:55.320
Also it goes toward um

52:56.680 --> 53:02.600
Not being able to go by myself like more socks because I have this a natural sock collection

53:05.320 --> 53:08.840
My socks look like a big pink of like barcode anyway

53:11.800 --> 53:13.800
Said you were two dollars and thirty seven cents

53:14.760 --> 53:17.160
Okay, I actually only have eleven dollars

53:17.160 --> 53:25.160
Um, thank you to bandwidth, and I really am not angsty about much of anything else.

53:25.160 --> 53:26.160
Cool.

53:26.160 --> 53:29.160
Thank you to work tomorrow, I don't want to go.

53:29.160 --> 53:30.160
Next.

53:30.160 --> 53:31.160
Oh, no.

53:31.160 --> 53:40.200
Um, let's see, um, my FUs of the week are, um, FU to those people that squat on Derby

53:40.200 --> 53:46.640
Owners Club, that sucks, FU to gas prices, oh my god, even the cheap shit's two bucks

53:46.640 --> 53:51.240
a gallon

53:51.240 --> 53:54.880
what else do i want to say if you too

53:54.880 --> 53:57.100
and uh...

53:57.100 --> 53:59.400
i don't know if you to uh...

53:59.400 --> 54:04.360
the fact that i haven't got laid six months that sucks

54:04.360 --> 54:05.560
loki stern

54:05.560 --> 54:10.720
cuz we're all keeping quick tonight i a m

54:10.720 --> 54:13.040
let's see well if you see bill kids

54:13.040 --> 54:14.400
just everywhere

54:14.400 --> 54:16.400
still mother young

54:16.400 --> 54:20.600
Effie, there's a stupid, slow-ass van that was in front of me on my way here.

54:20.600 --> 54:24.920
I understand that you like going 25 miles an hour in a 35, and the fact that all the

54:24.920 --> 54:31.040
people in your van are disabled, probably blind or deaf or something, you know, seriously,

54:31.040 --> 54:35.960
if I had any sort of, you know, rocker-propelled explosive, that van would be gone.

54:35.960 --> 54:41.120
And you know, I almost attempted to push him into traffic because I figured, you know,

54:41.120 --> 54:42.440
who's going to miss them?

54:42.440 --> 54:43.440
No one's going to miss them.

54:43.440 --> 54:45.880
So Effie, either that.

54:45.880 --> 54:53.500
And F.E. to my site for being stupid because FTP went link right and that sucked because

54:53.500 --> 54:56.160
all the files are down for like all day.

54:56.160 --> 54:57.920
But I fixed that and that was cool.

54:57.920 --> 55:03.880
And F.E. to me for having so much work because I'm like busy all the time and I can't enjoy

55:03.880 --> 55:04.880
anything.

55:04.880 --> 55:07.240
Just work, work, work, work, work.

55:07.240 --> 55:12.040
And oh, F.E. to gas prices because they suck.

55:12.040 --> 55:15.780
I just know because all the gas station tenants are just gels that were bombing their country.

55:15.780 --> 55:20.620
So uh, that's it, I'm done.

55:20.620 --> 55:21.620
Oh my god.

55:21.620 --> 55:25.300
Alright, I only got a few FUs.

55:25.300 --> 55:29.060
One is to those people who get on the bus in the wheelchairs but manage to get up and

55:29.060 --> 55:31.220
walk when they get off the bus.

55:31.220 --> 55:35.220
I always wondered like to slow these people who just look absolutely normal, if you push

55:35.220 --> 55:39.460
them out to traffic I bet you anything they would get up and run.

55:39.460 --> 55:43.580
They would leave the wheelchair at the middle of the road and get up and fucking run.

55:43.580 --> 55:46.340
Another one is to my lack of concentration.

55:46.340 --> 55:52.540
Today I almost full comboed Can't Stop Falling in Love on Light 7 on 2DX and I missed the

55:52.540 --> 55:59.340
last fucking note and so I almost killed the machine as I jumped up in circles.

55:59.340 --> 56:03.980
Another one is the little bastards over at Scandia, the little kids who just think it's

56:03.980 --> 56:07.980
a really good idea to try to get in your way when you're playing 2DX, you just want to

56:07.980 --> 56:09.820
reach over and kick them.

56:09.820 --> 56:14.820
Yeah, that's pretty much about it, because I haven't had much of a week.

56:14.820 --> 56:17.820
Fuck you to dead people, because it sucks.

56:17.820 --> 56:20.820
What? No, I have a mic.

56:20.820 --> 56:29.820
Fuck you to the assholes that were getting in my way while I was trying to pass Dyken Kai Light yesterday at Country Club Lanes.

56:29.820 --> 56:32.820
You couldn't pass it anyway. Xam's deaths are gay.

56:32.820 --> 56:34.820
No, I know, but still...

56:34.820 --> 56:38.820
They're getting in my way, getting on the machine, and giving me shit.

56:40.820 --> 56:42.820
Fuckin' A, man.

56:42.820 --> 56:45.820
What were they doing? Were they standing between you and the machine going,

56:45.820 --> 56:46.820
What are you doing? What are you doing?

56:46.820 --> 56:48.820
No, they're stepping on the arrows.

56:48.820 --> 56:50.820
She just stepped on their foot.

56:50.820 --> 56:51.820
I was.

56:51.820 --> 56:52.820
With spiked heels.

56:52.820 --> 56:54.820
I know. I need to...

56:54.820 --> 56:56.820
I know you own a pair.

56:56.820 --> 56:59.820
Definitely. Cleats, indeed, yes.

57:02.820 --> 57:13.820
You know, one of these days on the show, I'm just going to be myself and be nice. Seriously. Because I'm like a really nice person. I mean, I'm a really nice person. I just have weird strangers.

57:13.820 --> 57:14.820
Really?

57:14.820 --> 57:19.820
I am nice. You guys have all made me out to be like this crazy racist guy.

57:19.820 --> 57:21.820
I'm not that person.

57:21.820 --> 57:23.820
What did you get for hanging out with Rob?

57:23.820 --> 57:27.820
I love everybody except the disabled and stupid people.

57:27.820 --> 57:32.820
That would have fallen under stupid people.

57:32.820 --> 57:35.820
Actually, disabled people are cool if they're smart.

57:35.820 --> 57:39.820
It's just the stupid people I hate. I hate stupid people all about.

57:39.820 --> 57:41.820
I hate humanity.

58:09.820 --> 58:14.300

59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.480

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.920

my life's been good

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:17.260
So your life's good so you can't say hi to us anymore?

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:20.260
I'm just so excited!

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:24.260
I don't know, I've been poking around Scandia lately after work, but I get off work at 1.30, so...

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:25.260
Oh, poopy.

01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:27.260
So nobody gets to see me over there myself.

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:29.260
You're just a mystery now.

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:30.260
I am?

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:32.260
Well, I mean, you know, because we don't see you.

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:33.260
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:35.260
You know what, I've really gone down in skill, too.

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:39.260
I mean, I was doing just a standard little one, and then all of a sudden my legs stopped working.

01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:41.260
Me too, and I've gotten fat, see?

01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:43.260
Uh-huh.

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:47.020
you're expecting to yeah i don't know so what what do you want to take all the

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:50.660
listeners the worldwide listeners of orange lounge radio

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:53.520
play lots of the d r and try to lose your belly

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:58.900
for god's sake you're embarrassing yourself

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:02.440
we want to talk about embarrassing yourselves and we saw the guy today holy

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.240
crap

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:06.520
did he suck asset freestyle

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:10.120
and he's just like getting up on their doubles he had no sense of you know

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:14.280
coordination, balance, rhythm, or anything. I don't even know why he's... I don't even

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.360
know how he's able to do doubles to begin with.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.200
Robin, I don't know anything about that.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:21.920
He was just up there, like, doing his thing, like, holding the bar, and he, he tried jumping...

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:27.800
Okay, first he started off his first stomp, plain, light, uh, little, with no freeze arrows,

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:33.880
and he jumped up over the bar, totally off cue, and totally missed the first step, nearly,

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.280
like, broke his ankle. It was hilarious.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:36.800
Woo-hoo!

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.360
Bye!

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:37.880
Bye!

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:38.880
Bye!

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:39.880
Bye!

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:42.680
Did you ever get to do your FUs, Nita?

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:43.680
Too much chaos.

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:46.000
Um, I didn't really have an FU.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.800
Why are all the women nice today except Jamie?

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:48.800
Jamie's always mean, though.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.800
We expect that of her.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:50.800
Yeah.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.800
My week's been going okay, so I guess I don't really have an FU.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:53.800
Oh.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:54.800
So...

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.800
I mean, all of this is made of furniture.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.800
Yes, okay.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.720
Furniture made by what we assume to be communists.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.280
Dude, it sucked.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.960
It took like four hours to put a fucking desk together.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.280
Yes, this desk.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:13.480
of all, weighed like 200 pounds just to carry it. Yeah, this is a desk, a wooden desk, a

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:18.240
computer desk. Nothing worked right, nothing fit together the way it was supposed to. Oh,

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.960
and what about the drawer thing you're making now? The drawers don't even fit right. I'm

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:27.080
putting together a four dresser drawer that's not like another six million pieces. It sucks.

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:30.960
It's communist. So fuck you to furniture that you have to put together. How do you like

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.960
It's like my desk, it has all these extra pieces.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.960
You have to put each individual screw together.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:40.960
A lot of screwing going on.

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.960
If anybody doesn't know what that's from, watch the clerk's part.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:45.960
It is the best thing ever.

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.960
So that's it. Anybody else have any fuck yous?

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:54.960
Give me microphone.

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:57.960
Time for puppy to bitch.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:58.960
Bitch.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.480
Hey, wait a minute.

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.080
Like a bitch is a dog?

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.080
Get it?

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.080
That's funny.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.080
Haha, yeah.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.080
Shut up.

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.080
Okay.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.320
Damn, why y'all be such a bitch?

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.320
Shit.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.800
I'm gonna catch you.

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.800
Okay.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.800
What the?

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:18.800
Who?

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:19.800
Who the hell?

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.800
Okay.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:21.800
Okay, look out.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:25.240
Jamie needs to get through.

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.240
Do your ad views, puppy.

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:38.240
First of all, I'd like to give a fuck you to my toilet in my bathroom, because the toilet seat broke a couple days ago, and now I cannot sit on it.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:41.240
Given the term, I'm going to cut your ass up in a whole new meeting.

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:52.240
Yes, indeed. And then, let's see, fuck the smell of weed, because it stinks, and it doesn't come out of carpeting very well.

01:03:52.240 --> 01:04:01.240
Yes. Because I can smell it in the other room when nobody ever smokes it besides in the room next door. It sucks.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.240
Ah, to be in a college dorm again.

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:16.240
Yeah. Fuck dorm food, which I no longer call real food. I spell it differently now. I spell it with two u's instead of two o's because it's not worthy of being called real food.

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:18.240
I think you should use an umlaut.

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:24.240
I could do that, yes, but I was too lazy to try and figure out what key that is.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:28.240
Alright, now we get to the chat rooms I've used. Has everyone gone?

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:33.240
Okay, first one comes from Japan Man.

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:37.240
Fuck you little kids who get on when he plays Cool 7.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.240
And fuck you to people who don't like my baby mama.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.240
Agreed.

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:45.240
I think we should play that during the next break.

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:54.240
The next one is from JB, or Justin Circuit, in the name.

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.240
Jenny's bitch.

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:56.240
Yeah, Jenny's bitch.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:01.240
FU to ATCBI Comcast, they canceled the account due to a server glitch and couldn't get it

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:05.240
on for three days when it did work, emails didn't work, and hasn't gotten two of the

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:09.240
secondary accounts and called customer service 18 times and been on the line with them for

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.240
five hours total.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.240
You know what?

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.240
There's a solution to that.

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.240
It's called Better Business Bureau.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.240
You should write them.

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:20.120
I have an F.U. for my computer.

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:25.200
F.U. to Microsoft because their Windows XP thinks it wants to try to connect to the

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.960
internet all the time even though I click the

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:30.360
options that says do not connect to the internet and instead it's like

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:34.160
oh I want to connect to the internet. J.B. by the way talk to me later and I'll let you

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.440
know how you can get them in

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:40.000
in legal trouble with the federal government. Go frivolous lawsuits

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.120
and tell them to suck your dick

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:49.600
Um, John Field says FU'd assholes in his dorm that let the air out of his two rear tires

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:50.960
and forced him to call AAA.

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:51.960
Yes, that sucks.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:53.960
Um, next one goes...

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:54.960
Oh, oh, oh!

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:58.040
Fuck AAA for having such high insurance rates.

01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:59.040
What the fuck is that?

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.040
Yeah, but AAA...

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:04.220
I don't have AAA and my friend's AAA let me unlock my car door when I let my keys in.

01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:05.220
That is pretty cool.

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:06.220
But AAA can still blow me.

01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:07.220
Okay, next...

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:08.220
Ooh, we need to get through these.

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:09.220
That's California.

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:10.840
Next is Ninja Usagi Koi.

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:14.780
I want to send an F.U. to our mall for not letting us put the DDR machines outside for

01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:18.740
a tournament and now all the people are going to die from heat stroke and yeah an F.U. to

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:22.740
her dad and for not letting her hang out with Yogi, dad, love you.

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:27.220
I know that situation about not moving a machine outside for a tournament, yeah.

01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:29.700
Oh yes, DVGL.

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:32.940
Yes, I know that situation, I feel ya.

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:36.300
Muheimer, first of all, hello to Darketia.

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:37.820
Hi Muheimer.

01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:39.460
Hi, Muheimer.

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:42.140

Smelly cat.

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.740
Smelly cat.

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:54.060
She told us she had to go potty three times.

01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:55.900
Was it number one or number two?

01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:57.620
Yeah, she should have gone in the pool.

01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:59.980
Maybe I'll be swimming in pee.

01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:02.080
Fuck that feeling when you have 800 different food

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.500
items in your house and you can't find the one unknown thing

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:05.860
you're craving.

01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:13.420
and

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:17.860
fuck gay people for not living near him and making him feel lonely

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:19.660

01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:36.820
thank you today we don't have dead air i don't know what you're talking about

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:38.940
it might be rebuffers or something

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:43.200
but it's not ask is as far as i can see we're so broadcasting just fine

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:46.460

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:49.920

The second activity goes to a DDR Extreme OST for apparently not being released.

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:04.900
They're not going to release it?

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:08.900
It's not going to be out for a while. However, talk to me later.

01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:11.900

Yeah, we might be able to hook you up anyway.

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:19.900
F.U. took the California high school exit exam for making me come to school while three-fourths of the whole school got to sleep in.

01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:22.900
You know what? For the Alabama ones, they just gave it to us while we were in class.

01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:24.900
There's an exit exam now in high school?

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:27.900
And, like, I got a hundred on it.

01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:29.900
I don't remember that.

01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:31.900

01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:51.900
Everyone in the class.

01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:55.900

Yeah, that's okay if you missed the whole thing about 24. That was nothing.

01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:34.780

So that I'm feeling all agronomied

01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:00.640
Baby, do you want the juice?

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.640
Baby, do you want it?

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.640
Baby, do you want the juice?

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:05.920
Dad if you want it

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:18.540
Oh, you better, even if it's easy for someone to want to

01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:26.620
Oh, you better, even if it's easy for someone to want to

01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:33.620
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Real Radio makes Captain Jack cry.

01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:58.660
horrible, too bad about that. Okay, let's hear it again.

01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:02.080
First off, fuck driver's training in the poop shoot. I would honestly rather have a duck

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:05.180
shoot down my throat than to have to sit through that boring-ass shit. Everyone in the class

01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:08.100
is a total bitch, even the teacher. It's not like if you have a penis in test schools I

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:11.740
hate you. I love special test schools because they're sensitive bad men. Or men bad, I should

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:15.820
say. Respect women because we spit you out our baby holes. Indeed. Fuck driver's training

01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:19.460
only, fuck it so exclusively so that all of my horrible negative energy can be used to

01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:24.140
destroy driver's training forever. That fucking school can suck my ass. I haven't slept more

01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:33.140
than 4 hours each night this past week and I won't get enough sleep this week. Fuck that bullshit, fuck it up the nosehole. Yes, the nosehole. But you missed the fuckity fuck fuck fuck. That was the best.

01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:35.140
Fuck fuckity fuck fuck. Fuck you, you fuckin' fuck.

01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:36.140
Yeah.

01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:37.140
Alright.

01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:38.140
Shit.

01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:47.140
So, we wanted to do another, we wanted to do another song really fast, but it's something that Loki has to introduce, and why is that, Mr. Loki?

01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:49.140
It's another remix I did.

01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:52.140
You know, it's not as good as my last one.

01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:54.140
It kinda sucked.

01:20:54.140 --> 01:21:00.140
But, I think the problem was because I ended too fast, because I was trying to get it at about three minutes.

01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:05.140
And, um, it kinda just, it builds up slowly and then ends kinda quickly.

01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:07.140
So, that's kinda the bad thing.

01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:10.140
But anyways, um, it's another remix.

01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:14.140
It's called, um, Dark Black Force, the Midnight Angel Mix.

01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:21.140
And since you're all such big Loki fanboys and girls, here you go.

01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:51.140
It's a long way to go, honey.

01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:54.140
I know, but I'm away.

01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:56.140
Where are we going?

01:22:56.140 --> 01:22:59.140
The dark, black forest.

01:23:56.140 --> 01:24:17.060
That was pretty good.

01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:18.300
I was really impressed with that.

01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:19.300
That was pretty neat.

01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:20.300
It was very subtle.

01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:24.860
The modem stream probably doesn't do that justice, because a lot of it's very subtle.

01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:53.860
But, as, okay, well we probably should go into Symphon News since this is Symphon News, um, okay, obviously Symphon News, the big news, well for me at least, is Leech from Loki 2.0 has finally, finally, two month delay launched, um, it's got, right now, the initial update had the 2DX DWI project files for 2DX second style through fifth style.

01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:59.700
5th style, and so there's about, I'd say about 50-some files up there at the moment. I'm

01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:05.700
uploading more probably later this week as I get to work on them. I went ahead and...

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:17.400
Oh, man, it looks ugly on that. Okay, anyways. So, I went ahead and, as promised, exclusive

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:22.380
to Orange Launch Radio, if you're a wonderful listener of the show, you get access to a

01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:27.520
special page every week and now I was kind of bad and didn't really hide the

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:31.800
page well enough this time but next time the files will be more hidden but

01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:38.340
anyways this page exclusively you guys is gonna be the release of my two remixes

01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:45.600
the legend of trance and the dark black forest midnight angel mix and so to

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:52.320
access this page what you want to do is go to my site which is www.willddr.com

01:25:52.320 --> 01:26:00.720
rforfood.net slash leechfromloki and then what you want to do once you get to that and

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:08.640
you want to type in also the special HTML page which is going to be hotmonkeysex.html

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:15.240
and that will bring you up to the wonderful page with my two links for my MP3s.

01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:18.480
It's a secret page and what are the special MP3s that they can download this week?

01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:24.080
Legend of Trance, which is a remix of the Legend of Max, which is just fucking awesome.

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:26.960
That's my favorite remix so far.

01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:33.280
That's Legend of Trance, Loki versus ZZ, featuring Sun Decade.

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:40.980
Then we have Dark Black Forest, Midnight Angel Mix, Steve Reiner versus Loki, featuring Cenaris.

01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:45.000
So those are exclusive remixes to Orange Lounge listeners, and we just posted the link in

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.680
the chat room if you didn't get it.

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:51.680
So go leech away and you can listen to those, but don't listen to them now, wait until after the show, because we need our listeners.

01:26:51.680 --> 01:27:01.680
Yeah, so we'll have, um, well as far as DWI's going, you know, for Legend of Trance, as mentioned on the page, um, thinking about that one for Attorney Mix 4.

01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:10.680
So, um, that'll be that one, but Dark Black Forest, Midnight Angel Mix is up for grabs, so. It's just a steady 140 bpm.

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:28.680
Well, speaking of your mixes, how about something that was your choice? How about the cage matches?

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:37.680
I don't have Holic, but it won't play the background because of my stupid sound card. Fuck my sound card!

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:40.280
do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:44.160
You sound like Hee Haw!

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:45.160
Not like Ten.

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:46.160
Ah, maybe Pearl!

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:49.480
And this is Hee Haw!

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:54.440
But no, we're going to go ahead and play, um, basically the way that our cage match

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:59.480
works is each of us picks a song, and one of us will have won the previous week, so

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:02.460
that's the song that should be in rotation right now, but really isn't right now.

01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:03.500
It isn't right now.

01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:11.500
Well, we'll figure it out. We'll put them both in or something, the last week's winner, unless it wins again, which it may. It may win again, but I don't think it will.

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:20.500
But anyway, you, our chat room, votes over private message whether or not, you know, which one that you think should win.

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:28.500
So, as for right now, I'm closing all of these open windows, even though I'm having a conversation with somebody.

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:35.000
Wait till all of the songs are over and though the we you know much like our lovely friends on American Idol

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.400
We'll give our own opinions of these songs and rate them

01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:43.960
But I don't like it. I think it stunk, but don't let don't let us influence you or better yet. Just let me influence you

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:51.580
Gonna play a clip of last week's winner, right? Yeah, I'll play a decent clip of it because actually I actually have like that three

01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:58.580
This is Sasha with Xpander, this is last week's winner.

01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:43.860
That was a little bit of an expander.

01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:46.420
Anyway, this is Rob's pick of the week.

01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:47.420
You want to tell us about it?

01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:48.420
Hi, yeah.

01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:49.420
Actually, we should write that song.

01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:50.420
It's cool.

01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:51.420
I give it a 7.

01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:56.260
weeks usually because we already ranked it last week all right and we said it

01:29:56.260 --> 01:30:00.220
shouldn't win and it did because our chat room hate this okay my song and I

01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:03.000
had to kind of come up with this at the last minute this really isn't what I

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.640
would have usually picked I completely forgot that like hi we're moving the

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:10.020
show tonight so I actually have to burn a CD off my song but luckily I have a CD

01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:13.660
in my car and this is actually a pretty good song and I got turned on to this

01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:18.300
song a couple years ago because I love Drew Barrymore and she was in a movie

01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:22.180
called Ever After, and this song was in the trailer, and I love this song, and I think

01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:26.340
y'all will dig it too. So, it's a couple years old, but it's still classic. Robert Miles

01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:33.340
with fable.

01:30:56.340 --> 01:31:10.340
Talk to me tenderly, so reality fantasy, we'll melt together only in one thing.

01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:17.340
Talk to me, tenderly So reality and disease

01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:24.340
We'll match together in one thing

01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:51.340
Save our own fun

01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:57.340
Save our own fun

01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:04.340
Save our own fun

01:34:07.340 --> 01:34:11.340
Save our own fun

01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:16.340
Tell me a fable

01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:20.340
Tell me a fable

01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:23.340
A fable

01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:26.340
A fable

01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:31.340
A fable that will never end

01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:35.340
And now I dream

01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:37.340
Dream

01:34:37.340 --> 01:34:42.340
One, two, three

01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:14.340
Oh

01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:44.340
Oh

01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:57.300
That was Robert Miles of Fable.

01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:59.780
The big plop at the end is the best.

01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:10.140
As far as my opinion of that song, he's done better, so it gets a six.

01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:14.200
Microphones are going every which way.

01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:15.600
The song is alright.

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:18.560
Yeah, like, he could have done better, but, um,

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:20.740
Ever After really sucked ass.

01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:21.820
So, uh,

01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:23.820
that's gonna affect my decision.

01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:29.540
Um, I'm gonna have to give it a six.

01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:32.780
That song rocks and you don't. Ten.

01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:37.300
Oh wow, that's a real biased opinion there.

01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:40.540
i have a really bad experience with that movie

01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:42.860
care to explain?

01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:45.500
go there with the chick who cheats on you and gets pregnant

01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:47.720
that's all i gotta say

01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:49.620
seriously? it's about the song not the movie

01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:51.960
i know that's why i just said

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:53.280
people tell me to explain

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:54.420
no um...

01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:57.360
honestly i really didn't like that song

01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:59.700
so i'll give it like a four

01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:04.780
and that's being really really really nice

01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:09.580
For those people that are listening, Rob's is giving raspberries to Zero right now.

01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:12.540
Many times.

01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:16.180
I don't know, I thought it was nice.

01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:17.860
Honestly?

01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:19.660
That song would put me to sleep

01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:25.020
if I weren't in here talking to other people right now.

01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:28.860
Six. I could probably see it in, like, keyboard mania or something.

01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:34.920
okay i like that song okay so i have a new if you to all you bitches in here

01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:41.920
i give that's under ten because that's like my kind of song i like it

01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:47.400
i'd have to give it like a nine it's it's a pretty good time i like it back

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:48.280
yet

01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:51.960
uh... i'd like any trends just about that

01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:52.840
any soft

01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:59.840
hard anything

01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:03.700
okay i'll say that again i give that's on the nine

01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:04.100
it's not

01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:08.260
point think that it's pretty damn good

01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:11.940
all right well i have to give it a second i heard a uh... deejay epic

01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:13.700
version that's about like

01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:17.660
that's twice as good as that so i'll do it

01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:21.500
so the average scores and remember i'm not very good at math nine so

01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:24.760
uh...

01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:27.180
okay

01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:29.280
it's my turn now

01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:32.920
and i don't know who did this because i downloaded it by accident one day

01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:36.920
But this is Link's theme. Heave dance remix. Here you go.

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:48.800
Okay, I know it's not the best and I didn't put it in there with an intention of winning,

01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:54.320
but when I first downloaded it, it made me really bouncy and hyper, so I give it a 7.

01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:55.320
I'll go ahead.

01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:58.920
Um, like when I'm listening to that, I like bounce up and down a lot, and then like I

01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:02.240
want to take a really big shit.

01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:09.240
So I give it eight rolls of toilet paper.

01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:36.240
We'll put that there. Look, I made a remix! Woohoo! Look at me go!

01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:38.240
I got a big bass. Wanna come over?

01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:49.240
So, um, yeah, I'm gonna have to give that, like, a two, and, uh, and Robert Miles' song, well, is better now.

01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:57.240
Having, having, having, you know, it's like, it's like if you have the ugly chick and you stand next to her and it makes you look better.

01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:00.240
That's what this song was. This song was the ugly chick.

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:05.240
And the rest of the room roasts and groans with that comment.

01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:08.240
Oh, come on. Was it really that bad?

01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:10.240
Yes.

01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:12.240
Uh, eight.

01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:14.240
I...

01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:17.240
Oh, come on. Loki can do better than that.

01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:19.240
Anyways, uh...

01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:21.240
I like it. It's short!

01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:24.240
It's short. That's a good thing about a song. It's short. It doesn't drag out.

01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:27.240
I give it an eight and a half.

01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:30.780
Okay, so I like the fact that it was bouncy it was bouncy

01:43:30.780 --> 01:43:35.680
So there's a couple of points there and it had links theme which a couple of other points

01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:38.240
But other than that, it sucked ass. I'm giving it to

01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:42.680
Real real real quick if it's going that fast. How fuck are you gonna dance to that?

01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:52.880
I know it's a little fast little too bouncy little too happy happy. I don't think I like it that much

01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:59.160
I give it like a seven or a six but I give Loki's commentary a ten. I love that

01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:03.940
Okay, I just want to say really fast. So Loki you don't dance to it. You have sex to it

01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:11.920
Freaking blow vessel doing that man

01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:15.200
hahaha

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:18.880
your god thank god for you people that we don't have video attached to that

01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:19.920
don't tell the girls that

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:23.680
pull out the master sword baby yeah

01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:26.040
no! oh god bad thought

01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:28.760
I thought it was too repetitive I gave it a six

01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:31.280
I just don't want to tell Dan that Rob did humping

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:33.680
motions in his chair

01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:37.680
you know what I say if the FUs were still going I would say fuck you to all who gave it lower

01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:40.200
than at least a seven

01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:41.320
if you don't have any like...

01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:43.320
Well, the fuck you do over there?

01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:44.900
Fuck you, buddy!

01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:49.340
Fuck you too!

01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:52.320
Here's an idea, okay? Here's an idea.

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:56.720
I've heard better Final Fantasy remixes, okay? Better Final Fantasy remixes, they

01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:00.760
need to just do a decent remix of it, then we'll give it a decent score.

01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:06.680
Alright, well let's just go ahead and get voting out of the way. We're gonna play a little bitty clip to the songs one more time.

01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:09.600
We're going to name them all, and here's a little bit of it.

01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:11.400
This one is Sasha with Expander.

01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:26.840
OK, that's enough.

01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:31.280
Next one is Robert Miles with Fable.

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:32.520
Yay.

01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:38.760
Okay, that's enough of that.

01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:41.760
And then leak, and then leak, same.

01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:44.640
Okay, that's enough of that.

01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:45.640
Vote!

01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:46.640
Vote now!

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:50.880
In the meantime, we're gonna hand the microphone to Loki to go angst on us again while I pull

01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:51.880
up the next break.

01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:55.640
Well, I'm gonna do the Monty news, because we promised it like, we promised it like an

01:45:55.640 --> 01:46:00.760
hour ago and we never did it, so you've all been sitting there getting moist, your panties

01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:03.760
to be getting moist in anticipation of this hot, hot...

01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:04.760
I'm drying up my...

01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:09.760
I can't believe Puppy just said that!

01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:10.760
Say that again!

01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:12.760
Things dried up by now!

01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:14.760
Never, Krusty!

01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:15.760
God!

01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:18.760
Things I did not need to know.

01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:19.760
Alright.

01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:21.760
I am stealing this news.

01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:24.760
I will quote my source because a lot of people don't.

01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:27.760
I was just surfing around the net during one of the breaks and I found this news.

01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:29.760
It was posted on the LiveJournal community for Bamani.

01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:35.160
So, it's just username Bemani on the LiveJournal community, livejournal.com slash tilde Bemani.

01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:39.600
And by the way, I'll take this opportunity to plug that Orange Lounge also has a LiveJournal

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:40.600
community.

01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:44.000
So, if you go to livejournal.com slash tilde Orange Lounge, there's our community.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.800
So, if you use LiveJournal, add us to your friends list because we like it when people

01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:48.800
add us to their friends list.

01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:53.800
I had a LiveJournal once, then I never posted and they got rid of it for me.

01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:56.120
All right, here we go.

01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:57.440
I don't think they deleted Council again.

01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:58.840
I think you just forgot your password.

01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:02.300

01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:49.780
all in fun right so finally Konami will launch the location test for Bahmani 2d

01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:54.100
x night style on May 5th we have rumors saying that this is going to be the last

01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:57.340
Last installment, but it has not been confirmed yet.

01:47:57.340 --> 01:48:00.380
On the official site, they announced a few songs that will be brought back, however,

01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:01.380
that is not all.

01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:04.700
We all know that Beatmania has closed its history last year with the release of Beatmania

01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:05.700
the Final.

01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:06.700
It was not over yet.

01:48:06.700 --> 01:48:09.540
They are also bringing back some songs that was on Beatmania.

01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:15.100
The songs include LED Hellscaper, Tack with Release Your Mind, Pink Pong with Pink Dream,

01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:20.740
The Bald Heads Scagogo, DJ Naguro with Miriam, featuring Believe Again.

01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:23.860
Just to name a few, I'm pretty sure that some of those songs would be remixed by our favorite

01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:27.580
artists due to massive resurrection of classic Beatmania songs, it is possible that they

01:48:27.580 --> 01:48:32.420
may have to take out many 2DX songs as well.

01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:37.140
Of course, we will have new songs brought to us by DJ Taka, Tack, Ram and many other

01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:38.140
familiar names.

01:48:38.140 --> 01:48:43.780
Some songs that would definitely catch our heart include Taka with Natural Principle,

01:48:43.780 --> 01:48:51.340
Aya with Death Wind, Tack with Irrational, Yamato with X49, and Akira Yamaka with Electric

01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:52.340
Wave.

01:48:52.340 --> 01:49:04.340
I also scoured several of my downloading places and I haven't found that anywhere.

01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:27.780
Konami in Japan paid attention, but I'm sure as popular as it is in Japan, they wouldn't

01:49:27.780 --> 01:49:28.780
cut it off now.

01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:32.580
Just don't let 2DX get in the hands of, uh, Konami of America, holy crap.

01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:34.580
Oh god, that's a scary thought!

01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:36.780
And Rob almost fell out of his chair.

01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:40.540
Unless they're gonna give us, like, you know, 9-Key 2DX or something, I don't know.

01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:42.440
That'd be weird.

01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:45.440
But then it'd be Popping DX!

01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:46.440
Resurrect...

01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:50.820
Resurrect frickin', um, what was it, Kraken DJ.

01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:51.820
Kraken DJ's the shit.

01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:52.900
I like that game a lot.

01:49:52.900 --> 01:49:54.380
Anybody else want to say anything about night style,

01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:55.480
night style being the last things

01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:57.620
they want to see on night style?

01:49:57.620 --> 01:49:59.940
I don't know, more talking.

01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:05.860
If this were the last 2DX, say if they do a BeatMania 4,

01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:07.500
a fourth series or whatever.

01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:09.940
What do you think they should do in it?

01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:12.420
I was actually talking about this earlier today with Zero.

01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:15.340
I was saying that they should add, much like BeatMania 3

01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:19.460
had the foot pedal effector thing, which didn't do shit,

01:50:19.460 --> 01:50:23.860
Crossfader. Like, we were talking about, what was it we were talking about? Oh, Healing

01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:27.340
Vision Angelic, where that one part where it's just all da-na-na-na, they have that

01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:31.500
be like a Crossfader part on there. Something like that, I don't know. A little bit more

01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:37.500
elaborate. I was thinking also, you know, like in Keyboard Mania, how you have the wheel.

01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:43.140
Something like that, yeah. Yeah. Here's my suggestion, this is the same thing they need

01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:47.940
to do to DDR. Like, when they bring DDR to a new series, if they're gonna do a DDR, 2DX

01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:53.940
or whatever. They need to do a... Well, Freeze Notes is one thing, because Easy to DJ has

01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:55.940
that, but it's kind of overrated.

01:50:55.940 --> 01:51:03.580
They do have that. It's pretty cool. It's very few songs have it. I would suggest some

01:51:03.580 --> 01:51:08.180
kind of more elaborate battle mode. Like, imagine if they had the thing in Disney's

01:51:08.180 --> 01:51:10.620
Rave to 2DX. That would be cool.

01:51:10.620 --> 01:51:21.620
Oh yeah, yes, exactly. They have all these characters that they don't use anymore because they're the total background.

01:51:21.620 --> 01:51:27.620
I think the new versions of DDR and 2DX need to have more competitive modes because DDR has always been a co-op game till now.

01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:31.620
They need freaking Dance Battle again. That was in Second Mix.

01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:37.620
Exactly. If it elaborated a little more on competition, I think it would be a kick-ass game.

01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:42.620
Well, actually, what I would like to see again is another Link version.

01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:46.620
I think that would be a really good idea.

01:51:46.620 --> 01:51:50.620
So you think maybe it's a coincidence they're ending DDR and 2DX at the same time?

01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:55.620
To bring them back as this big, sub-stream resurrection?

01:51:55.620 --> 01:51:57.620
Maybe. Maybe not.

01:51:57.620 --> 01:52:05.620
You know what I'd like to see? I'd like to see Beatmania's song selection on DDR.

01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:12.620
Just get rid of all that shit that they're ripping from like Dance Mania, like all these speed mixes, anything from Wild Side, no.

01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:20.620
I say the Dance Mania stuff is the best stuff in DDR. It always is. Except, they do a little, sometimes not, but nine times less.

01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:24.620
As in the Queen songs that they horribly rape and destroy.

01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:26.620
The most freestyle of the songs.

01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:28.620
Always the most freestylable songs out of anything in DDR.

01:52:28.620 --> 01:52:36.620
So you're saying that you would rather take Senorita's Speedy Mix versus The Sound of Goodbye or Never Look Back...

01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:39.620
But See, The Sound of Goodbye and Never Look Back are licensed songs as well.

01:52:39.620 --> 01:52:40.620
Fly Away...

01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:44.620
Those are all licensed songs you're naming. They're not Konami originals. They're all licensed songs.

01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:49.620
Alright, fine. General Relativity, 19 November. How about WOWL70?

01:52:49.620 --> 01:52:52.620
I'm not saying to get rid of those, but don't get rid of the Dance Mania stuff because that's some of the best stuff.

01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:55.620
Oh, what am I talking about anyways? They just fuck up the steps in the first place.

01:52:55.620 --> 01:52:56.620
Exactly.

01:52:56.620 --> 01:53:01.620
Yeah, most of the dance weenie stuff is fine, but I got one word for you. JOGA.

01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:06.620
Okay. I got one word for you.

01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:09.620
I got one word for you, bitch. Politary.

01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:12.620
No, JOGA. Also known as Ban for Moore's Lounge.

01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:17.620
Cause they do, they're nothing but the same damn song every time.

01:53:17.620 --> 01:53:20.620
Oh god, look, he just said he wants to make a remix.

01:53:20.620 --> 01:53:22.620
Please do a JOGA remix. Please, please, please.

01:53:22.620 --> 01:53:25.620
Rob, by the way, I warned you, that's the trap chair. Don't fall.

01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:28.620
And Rob almost fell out of it again. That's like the second time in five minutes.

01:53:55.620 --> 01:54:00.620
Yeah, like, uh, We Are The Champions, because that song just played so much.

01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:02.620
I mean, I can't tell you how many times they tell people,

01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:07.620
Stop playing We Are The Champions, keep hearing that song over and over.

01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:11.620
They took Queen and made it gay.

01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:12.620
That's, that's...

01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:15.620
And for the record, I play that song.

01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:18.620
And for the record, Queen was gay.

01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:20.620
I know that, dammit!

01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:22.620
But the music wasn't until that.

01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:25.620
I think we just made JB have a cry because it's SyFam.

01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:28.620
Ice Queen, by the way, just got his name with that.

01:54:28.620 --> 01:54:32.620
Even still, you know, there's better stuff that's come from SyFam.

01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:36.620
Look at freakin' DDR USA. Those songs were awesome.

01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:38.620
You know, take it to the morning light, you know...

01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:41.620
Ooh, nah nah nah nah nah, yeah!

01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:44.620
Yeah! Seriously, better than...

01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:46.620
We are the champions!

01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:49.620
Ooh, nah nah nah nah nah, yeah!

01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:52.620
Dark Black Forest, I mean, that was awesome.

01:54:52.620 --> 01:54:55.620
Ooh, and SADSTORM!

01:54:55.620 --> 01:54:57.620
We can RAVE!

01:54:57.620 --> 01:55:01.620
You know what, I think we're gonna probably have to take a break.

01:55:01.620 --> 01:55:03.620
I have one more story that needs to be read.

01:55:03.620 --> 01:55:05.620
Needs to be read, because actually some people were alluding to this.

01:55:05.620 --> 01:55:06.620
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

01:55:06.620 --> 01:55:08.620
We have to also tell you the truth.

01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:10.620
Yeah, we have to tell you the truth. We'll do that during the break.

01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:12.620
But I have to read this news.

01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:15.620
And now, again, as with the last story,

01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:32.820
Konami of Japan told that they are thinking about introducing Beatmania 2DX to the USA.

01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:36.580
After gaining so much popularity by their release of DDR USA Mix, they said they are

01:55:36.580 --> 01:55:38.940
considering the release of the 2DX series as well.

01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:43.940
The Konami of Japan says DDR USA was a big success, the number of players are still increasing

01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:47.620
and we also get several emails asking if we are going to release the American version

01:55:47.620 --> 01:55:52.020
of 2DX. Konami of America is excited about this as well. One of the spokesmen said the

01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:58.900
DJ scene is probably more popular in America than Japan. I am sure that the game will catch

01:55:58.900 --> 01:56:05.900
the heart of both real DJs, not yet Loki, and the people who want to be one. So want

01:56:06.620 --> 01:56:13.580
to be a DJ, just start playing 2DX, that's exactly what they're saying here. The music

01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:18.100
is great for audience too, and I don't see why this can't be a success. It is rumored

01:56:18.100 --> 01:56:23.940
that the new machine will be revealed to E3 2003. Depending on the schedule, it might

01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:31.480
be postponed to 2004. Unlike DDR, instead of the home controller, the entire machine

01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:35.380
will be brought in and it will be on free play. They are also thinking about bringing

01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:39.540
guest players from Japan to show us how the game is played. That's where I start to think

01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:42.380
the story's bullshit i think the story's bullshit right there they don't need to

01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:43.940
go to cg daily city

01:56:43.940 --> 01:56:46.900
that well you know that'll be cool all they don't need to do that

01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:50.100
there's very good players here locally yet

01:56:50.100 --> 01:56:52.620
i mean when i say locally in california

01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:56.000
they don't acknowledge any of those people mean hello look at drop the bomb

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:56.900
system at that

01:56:56.900 --> 01:56:57.780
but six

01:56:57.780 --> 01:57:01.380
what will i go i don't think the i'm talking about bringing in the players is

01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:04.380
that that's what they did last year you do they have all u s players and i know

01:57:04.380 --> 01:57:07.020
mel is down there it makes it it would make sense

01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:10.900
that they would use local players if they know that there's a local scene.

01:57:10.900 --> 01:57:13.940
Well, anyway, let me finish and give the rest of his comments.

01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:17.820
One more exciting news about this is that they will have some songs that's

01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:20.540
only featured on the USA version of 2DX only.

01:57:20.540 --> 01:57:23.400
However, it may not satisfy some expert players, so this is going to be the

01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:24.900
first release of 2DX in America.

01:57:24.900 --> 01:57:28.260
It may be aimed at beginner players so they can get into the game easily.

01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:31.220
It's possible that the new feature is included like the beginner mode in DDR

01:57:31.220 --> 01:57:35.500
USA, possibly similar to the drill mode that's featured in 2DX 5th, 6th

01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:36.620
homestyle version.

01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:39.300
this might be a good chance for people who live outside of california to try

01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:41.640
this game out

01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:44.840
i'm actually going to um...

01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:49.060
take those to uh... a source and see if i can find any legitimacy but i doubt

01:57:49.060 --> 01:57:50.360
that it is

01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:53.480
we'll find out but just take it with a grain of salt that's a new story going

01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:57.240
around we're gonna report it

01:57:57.240 --> 01:57:58.880
the only

01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:02.720
the only way this is going to work is if they actually do a good job on this and

01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:03.660
you know

01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:05.240
good music for this

01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:05.880
um...

01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:12.880
However, looking at, you know, Konami of America's past track record, it's not looking good, folks.

01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:14.880
It's not looking good at all.

01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:17.880
I think they're gonna, I think they're gonna take 2DX and go,

01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:21.880
you know what? I think these players, because these players haven't played the Japanese songs,

01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:24.880
so let's take a bunch of stuff from first style, and then we're gonna take a shit on it,

01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:26.880
and then we're gonna add some new songs, too.

01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:28.880
No, no, wait, I'm gonna, I'm gonna disagree.

01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:33.880
Because if they, now, if they don't screw it, if they don't try to do this,

01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:38.040
We're going to do it on a learning curve. We're going to start easy with DDR USA, and then we're going to go to economics

01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:41.880
And then we're going to go to max USA which max USA if that had been the first one

01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:44.860
We would never have people bitching people would have been happy with that

01:58:44.860 --> 01:58:48.460
And you know what people wouldn't bitch about how Konami messes it up, so

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:53.280
You know what Konami which you need to do even though you want to milk the sales if you want to keep the fans

01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:58.640
Happy put it all encompassing into one game something that the beginners can pick up have your beginner mode

01:58:58.680 --> 01:59:02.720
But have those and others that will murder us to the expert stuff and good songs

01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:06.720
Well, not just Light 7, I'm talking like the Beginner 1, 2, where every song's a one-star.

01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:10.720
The Japanese ones have that, no one complains, it's pretty nice, it helps you learn how to play.

01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:15.720
Do that, don't just, don't give us a game that's only the 1, 2, and 3 stars, or people are gonna bitch.

01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:16.720
That would be ugly.

01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:19.720
If you don't learn how to play, Light 7, leave it there.

01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:21.720
Keep your Light 7, keep your 7 key.

01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:24.720
That way you have room for people to get better.

01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:39.720
I'll just put it this way, you put Vincent DeMure's Eternity on there, I don't care what the fuck you do, you can put a big gay-ass character in the opening logo, I don't give a crap at all, I'll play the game if you have Eternity on there.

01:59:39.720 --> 01:59:53.720
Hello, this is DJ Spanky, saying everybody should play 2DX USA. I endorse this fully. It has such wonderful songs in it, like Justify My Love by Madonna.

01:59:53.720 --> 02:00:01.560
So Mr. Spanky, does the nice, booming subwoofer make you feel special?

02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:05.240
This is what I would suggest you do when 2DX comes to the USA.

02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:10.080
Get your subwoofer and mount it really high so it comes up to the bar, then when you play,

02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:11.080
straddle the subwoofer.

02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:12.080
It's much funner.

02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:13.080
Oh, God.

02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:14.080
Oh, God.

02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:15.080
Oh, God.

02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:18.780
oh god

02:00:18.780 --> 02:00:24.620
it'll make your balls bounce

02:00:24.620 --> 02:00:25.680
okay

02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:26.660
that was

02:00:26.660 --> 02:00:31.300
that was a little too much information

02:00:31.300 --> 02:00:32.920
and the room falls silent

02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:36.400
i think that we should go to break while we tally the votes for a cage about which actually

02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:37.500
i've already done

02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:42.280
but uh... we'll go to break, we'll play a few songs, especially one by request

02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:43.520
and then uh...

02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:49.520
I will announce the winner for the cage match, which I tabulated while Noah was looking.

02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:52.760
Anyway, yeah, here you go

02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:51.520
Come on!

02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:56.520
Woo hoo!

02:02:56.520 --> 02:02:57.020
Woo-hoo!

02:03:56.520 --> 02:04:20.200
I said don't go, back it up again, you're never gonna keep me down

02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:24.200
Ooh, ooh, ooh, can we sing it?

02:06:50.200 --> 02:07:00.760
CH Theatre

02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:34.760
I can feel the rhythm, ooh yeah

02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:37.760
Got a feeling that I love you

02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:42.760

02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:05.760
Gotta get rid of the one, oh yeah

02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:13.760
Gotta get rid of the one, follow the one

02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:29.760
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join

02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:31.640
us on all the fun together.

02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:35.400
Hey, hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs

02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:38.880
absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great?

02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:41.400
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:48.400
Take it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:16.440

god i thought my tackling was that the ice queen's tackling with that

02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:30.580
uh...

02:10:30.580 --> 02:10:31.860
all right

02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:34.860
what we got to do now though we're gonna set up for a listless redo listless

02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:37.600
tonight right yes and what is the listless topic

02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:40.000
the topic is

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.760
What mocap game do we want to see?

02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:44.520
You've had mocap boxing,

02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:45.720
mocap golf,

02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:49.680
and now what should the next mocap game be? What would we want to see here

02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:50.480
in the studio?

02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:51.940
That's tonight's list list.

02:10:51.940 --> 02:10:53.360
So can we

02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:57.040
can we queue up a quick song to give us time to think? I'm going to do a few songs.

02:10:57.040 --> 02:10:59.820
Just do like, maybe like...

02:10:59.820 --> 02:11:03.440
We hate to play so many songs in a row, but we just need the time to think here.

02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:06.580
So we're going to do like maybe one or two quick songs,

02:11:06.580 --> 02:11:09.280
and then we'll be back.

02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:12.760
when it is a couple quick songs

02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:15.900
little it in a chance to do it and i think that over well

02:11:15.900 --> 02:11:18.420
that overwhelming response

02:11:18.420 --> 02:11:24.260
so it is a transfer will come back and uh... do mocap

02:11:24.260 --> 02:11:26.280
we're loading it up

02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:28.320

enjoy

02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:46.020
so we're gonna play Legend of the Trance

02:11:46.020 --> 02:11:50.180
if uh... we can get it

02:11:50.180 --> 02:11:51.100
with an L

02:11:51.100 --> 02:11:53.840
unfortunately not everybody in the studio is going to be able to help with

02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:55.520
listless tonight but we'll uh...

02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:57.600
we'll let them break any ties we have

02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:00.840
which we usually do to people who

02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:01.780
it's not working

02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:03.240
okay

02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:06.740
we're having technical difficulties so we're trying again

02:12:06.740 --> 02:12:07.840
I mean, it's not reading the CD.

02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:09.260
In the mean time...

02:12:09.260 --> 02:12:15.540
That's the CD.

02:12:15.540 --> 02:12:17.840
What else were you talking about during the break?

02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:21.520
Um...

02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:26.580
Okay.

02:12:26.580 --> 02:12:32.900
Uh, we're looking for the... There it is. Okay, yay, we got it. So we're gonna, uh, play Legend of the Trance and prepare our list list and we'll be right back.

02:12:32.900 --> 02:12:39.900
you are listening to Orange Launch Radio.

02:15:02.900 --> 02:15:22.620
Okay, we are back and we're ready.

02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:23.620
We're going to do the list list.

02:15:23.620 --> 02:15:24.620
Here we go.

02:15:24.620 --> 02:15:28.220
So the way list list works, in case you're a new listener to the show, what we're going

02:15:28.220 --> 02:15:29.980
to do, we're all going to name our top three.

02:15:29.980 --> 02:15:35.060
We have six people in studio participating, the three hosts, interns Zero, Puppy, and

02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:36.660
Artistry are all participating tonight.

02:15:36.660 --> 02:15:37.660
Top three mocap games.

02:15:37.660 --> 02:15:39.900
By the way, for the record, mocap stands for motion capture.

02:15:39.900 --> 02:15:45.380
Yes, and you may have seen games like mocap boxing, golf, and another one, Tsuguri, which

02:15:45.380 --> 02:15:46.380
is the sword game.

02:15:46.380 --> 02:15:47.380
Very good.

02:15:47.380 --> 02:15:53.900
Also, if you've never, if you've, police 911 is kind of a mocap game, you can kind of count

02:15:53.900 --> 02:15:57.900
Para Para, whatever, you know, if you've never seen an actual mocap game, those are kind

02:15:57.900 --> 02:15:58.900
of rough estimates of what it is.

02:15:58.900 --> 02:16:00.500
It's a censor for your movement.

02:16:00.500 --> 02:16:01.500
Exactly.

02:16:01.500 --> 02:16:05.140
So, and then once we all name our top three, then we're going to do the elimination round,

02:16:05.140 --> 02:16:06.140
which is always fun.

02:16:06.140 --> 02:16:10.540
Each of us gets to take one off the list of somebody else's picks, or your own, if you

02:16:10.540 --> 02:16:11.540
so choose.

02:16:11.540 --> 02:16:14.060
I just kind of burped a little, that was good.

02:16:14.060 --> 02:16:17.700
And then the chat room has the ultimate vote.

02:16:17.700 --> 02:16:19.500
They're going to vote on their top three.

02:16:19.500 --> 02:16:23.020
And Ice Queen and DDRHolic, they're not doing lists, but they'll help us break ties.

02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:25.620
And Bombay's in the back there too, but he's digging through things.

02:16:25.620 --> 02:16:28.660
Are you, oh you look like you were hunched over looking at something.

02:16:28.660 --> 02:16:31.780
Are you gonna hurl? Do you need a barf bag? Are you okay?

02:16:31.780 --> 02:16:34.700
Do you need a donkey bag? Alright. Alright, here we go.

02:16:34.700 --> 02:16:38.820
My first choice for a mocap game

02:16:38.820 --> 02:16:42.420
is mocap horse racing. Mocap horse racing, yay!

02:16:42.420 --> 02:16:46.340
Where you're suspended on a giant saddle and have to spank.

02:16:46.340 --> 02:16:51.140
I almost had one like that on my list. Almost like that horse humping game that Namco put out, but not.

02:16:51.140 --> 02:16:57.540
Oh, uh, final furlong? Yeah.

02:16:57.540 --> 02:16:59.180
that would be fun now

02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:00.900
uh... vocab horse racing

02:17:00.900 --> 02:17:03.100
would it be will complete with initial be like arts

02:17:03.100 --> 02:17:04.540
yeah okay

02:17:04.540 --> 02:17:10.100
all right moving on was next next

02:17:10.100 --> 02:17:12.820
first choice is vocab drug dealing

02:17:12.820 --> 02:17:15.260
but without a drug dealing how would that work

02:17:15.260 --> 02:17:17.220
and i at least i want to reverse

02:17:17.220 --> 02:17:21.000
pretty much like you have a certain type period to get your product out on the

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.420
street as much as possible

02:17:23.420 --> 02:17:25.420
What exactly is being mocapped?

02:17:25.420 --> 02:17:27.420
You've run from cops.

02:17:30.420 --> 02:17:32.420
You've actually got to hand it to people and stuff.

02:17:33.420 --> 02:17:36.420
So are you on a treadmill when you do the running part?

02:17:36.420 --> 02:17:38.420
How fast can you whip out a ten?

02:17:39.420 --> 02:17:41.420
How fast can you take the money and do the drop and the drop?

02:17:41.420 --> 02:17:43.420
Catch the dime bags!

02:17:46.420 --> 02:17:50.420
Well, I'm just going to kind of expand on one of them that I had.

02:17:50.420 --> 02:17:52.420
I originally had put down mocap dancing.

02:17:52.420 --> 02:17:58.420
But instead, I'm going to put down Mocap Raivar.

02:17:58.420 --> 02:18:01.420
No, that's just Para Para, I thought.

02:18:01.420 --> 02:18:13.420
No, see, Para Para is more organized. Mocap Raivar is more of like, you're kind of just, yeah, more flailing involved.

02:18:13.420 --> 02:18:17.420
You got special bonus rounds where you get to massage people on E.

02:18:17.420 --> 02:18:21.420
Yeah, like the first thing, right, when you put in your money, it drops out an e-pill.

02:18:21.420 --> 02:18:23.420
You have to take it and wait five minutes.

02:18:23.420 --> 02:18:25.420
Exactly.

02:18:25.420 --> 02:18:27.420
It has little glow sticks on strings.

02:18:27.420 --> 02:18:30.420
It has little glow sticks on strings.

02:18:30.420 --> 02:18:32.420
That's beautiful. Alright.

02:18:32.420 --> 02:18:33.420
I think the lights flicker, too.

02:18:33.420 --> 02:18:34.420
Mocap Rayvar.

02:18:34.420 --> 02:18:37.420
Uh, moving on to Dark Tetsuya.

02:18:39.420 --> 02:18:41.420
Mocap Murder Simulator.

02:18:41.420 --> 02:18:43.420
Mocap Murder!

02:18:43.420 --> 02:18:47.420
So would it just be just like stabbing people or shooting them?

02:18:47.420 --> 02:18:49.420
I guess, yeah.

02:18:49.420 --> 02:18:52.420
What kind of people would you be murdering?

02:18:52.420 --> 02:18:53.420
Terrorists.

02:18:53.420 --> 02:18:56.420
Oh, terrorists. Aw, what an American answer.

02:18:56.420 --> 02:18:57.420
Go down.

02:18:57.420 --> 02:18:58.420
All right.

02:18:58.420 --> 02:19:00.420
Uh, puppy.

02:19:00.420 --> 02:19:01.420
Okay.

02:19:01.420 --> 02:19:03.420
Mocap binge drinking.

02:19:03.420 --> 02:19:05.420
Mocap?

02:19:05.420 --> 02:19:08.420
That's kinda like last night.

02:19:08.420 --> 02:19:10.420
Mocap binge drinking.

02:19:10.420 --> 02:19:15.060
I don't think anyone was binging.

02:19:15.060 --> 02:19:16.640
That was great, yeah. Anyway.

02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:20.220
Okay, mocap binging. How would that work? Would you have to, like, would it have, like, a floating keg?

02:19:20.220 --> 02:19:22.060
You'd have to...

02:19:22.060 --> 02:19:24.900
You'd probably have to, like, run...

02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:27.380
Yeah.

02:19:27.380 --> 02:19:28.420
Okay.

02:19:28.420 --> 02:19:30.680
Kind of along those same lines.

02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:37.700
Um, my number three choice, I said, is mocap girls gone wild.

02:19:37.700 --> 02:19:42.020
or what it does is it motion caps the girls lifting their shirts

02:19:42.020 --> 02:19:46.460
and showing their hooters to the uh... like boobies to mocap

02:19:46.460 --> 02:19:50.740
and then

02:19:50.740 --> 02:19:53.820
yeah i can see it now a bunch of little eight-year-old kids lighting up around

02:19:53.820 --> 02:19:59.060
this machine and seeing this chick just lifting up her shirt

02:19:59.060 --> 02:20:05.280
and all and mocap girls gone wild would have internet ranking of course

I don't know if you guys have heard, but here in Sacramento we have this guy who's famous

02:21:58.200 --> 02:22:02.560
for riding around on a bike in the middle of the night and punching women in the face.

02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:07.840
Which sounds funny, but it's a horrible crime, I mean, but, just, it's, it's weird. That's

02:22:07.840 --> 02:22:11.040
the only way you can describe it. What kind of guy just goes around and punches people

02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:13.760
in the face? Anyway.

02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:15.400
I don't think it's a guy, I think I'm doing it.

02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:23.280
You know, like, DC Sniper, you would, like, actually have to get in different positions,

02:22:23.280 --> 02:22:27.480
like the prone position and hiding in bushes and stuff and then you'd have to

02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:34.800

02:23:50.980 --> 02:23:57.980
Anita, how does a donkey punch work?

02:23:57.980 --> 02:24:02.980
Well, how come you think I know so much about it?

02:24:02.980 --> 02:24:05.980
Because you brought it up last night.

02:24:05.980 --> 02:24:09.980

Okay, freaking donkey punching is when you're like taking chick from behind me

02:24:25.980 --> 02:24:29.140
You just you take your fist and you smack it in the back of her head

02:24:30.340 --> 02:24:35.220
As hard as you can as hard you can so that she clenches. Yeah

02:24:35.220 --> 02:24:41.220
So you're fucking so many abs and then you start striking him in the back of the head.

02:24:41.220 --> 02:24:43.220
It can also be applied to men.

02:24:48.220 --> 02:24:49.220
Okay.

02:24:49.220 --> 02:24:50.220

Okay, you know like Mario Party 4?

02:25:15.220 --> 02:25:17.220
It came from every woman who wishes she had a penis.

02:25:17.220 --> 02:25:23.220
Well now you can! Now you can! And you know what, I know women that do the same damn thing. They pee in the snow.

02:25:23.220 --> 02:25:24.220
Maybe I should be playing a guitar.

02:25:24.220 --> 02:25:28.220
I'm trying to run. They write their name by running.

02:25:28.220 --> 02:25:32.220
I've heard stories.

02:25:32.220 --> 02:25:36.220
They write their name really big by running.

02:25:36.220 --> 02:25:40.220
For the people who are not here watching, Rob just turned purple.

02:25:40.220 --> 02:25:44.220
My turn!

02:25:44.220 --> 02:25:48.220
And actually, mine is not a funny one. Mine is actually a legitimate thing that I wish that they would make.

02:25:48.220 --> 02:25:52.220
We can't have that.

02:25:52.220 --> 02:25:53.220
Whoa!

02:25:53.220 --> 02:25:54.220
Whoa!

02:25:54.220 --> 02:25:58.960
Were you like, you know, you play the, you play, you play the, um, the District of Tron

02:25:58.960 --> 02:26:00.300
and you had your light cycle level.

02:26:00.300 --> 02:26:01.300
I don't even know what an 80's movie is, shit.

02:26:01.300 --> 02:26:02.300
Just trying to win?

02:26:02.300 --> 02:26:03.300
Yeah.

02:26:03.300 --> 02:26:04.300
I don't know, I'm serious.

02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:07.860
And this actually came, comes from a dream that I had a couple nights ago after I watched

02:26:07.860 --> 02:26:11.700
Tron where I dreamt that I was playing like this, a virtual Tron simulator game.

02:26:11.700 --> 02:26:12.700
It was so cool.

02:26:12.700 --> 02:26:13.700
That actually...

02:26:13.700 --> 02:26:15.020
And I like woke up all disappointed and then was trying.

02:26:15.020 --> 02:26:17.900
Tron is one of those 80 games that everybody like remembers, I think.

02:26:17.900 --> 02:26:18.900
I do anyway.

02:26:18.900 --> 02:26:20.900
By the way, Tron 2.0 needs to hurry up and come out.

02:26:20.900 --> 02:26:21.900
Yeah.

02:26:21.900 --> 02:26:23.900
mocap zanadu

02:26:23.900 --> 02:26:25.900

02:26:25.900 --> 02:26:27.900
we were back? hello

02:26:27.900 --> 02:26:29.900
i hope they got the mocap

02:26:29.900 --> 02:26:31.900
did they get mocap-tron? i hope so

02:26:31.900 --> 02:26:33.900
we'll see

02:26:33.900 --> 02:26:35.900
alright keep going

02:26:35.900 --> 02:26:37.900
one i got is for the most

02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:39.900
worth of sport in the world

02:26:39.900 --> 02:26:41.900
and it would be mocap curling

02:26:41.900 --> 02:26:43.900
so i just see someone like

02:26:43.900 --> 02:26:45.900
shaking their head

02:26:45.900 --> 02:26:47.900
and they're like

02:26:47.900 --> 02:26:49.900
like

02:26:49.900 --> 02:26:58.900
So I just see someone shuffling a disc, and then you can have a friend play, and you're both running in front with these little brooms trying to scrape out imaginary ice.

02:26:58.900 --> 02:27:00.900
Greatest Olympic sport ever.

02:27:00.900 --> 02:27:05.900
Because you can thank the Canadians for the greatest sport in history.

02:27:05.900 --> 02:27:08.900
You're throwing 40,000 rocks at me.

02:27:08.900 --> 02:27:17.900
Yes. Imagine it now. The game about the thing that most people spies. The worst form of life on the face of the earth. That's right.

02:27:17.900 --> 02:27:19.900
Mocap Panamime.

02:27:19.900 --> 02:27:24.900
Oh, that's great. Mocap Mime. Alright.

02:27:25.900 --> 02:27:27.900
If you kicked a mime in the nuts, would you scream?

02:27:30.900 --> 02:27:33.900
Alright. Dark Tetsuya says, for his number one.

02:27:33.900 --> 02:27:36.900
Three words. Mocap Mud Wrestling.

02:27:36.900 --> 02:27:38.900
Mocap Mud Wrestling, beautiful.

02:27:38.900 --> 02:27:39.900
I wonder where that came from.

02:27:39.900 --> 02:27:41.900
Would the sequel be Mocap Cream Corn Wrestling?

02:27:43.900 --> 02:27:44.900
K.Y. Wrestling.

02:27:47.900 --> 02:27:49.900
There's a scene for that in that movie Old School.

02:27:49.900 --> 02:27:50.900
Anyway...

02:27:57.900 --> 02:28:00.900
I realized that my number one choice sucks.

02:28:00.900 --> 02:28:04.900
I'm trying to think of a new one so Rob can go ahead of me for...

02:28:04.900 --> 02:28:08.800
Cuz I have any socks. Yes. Well, just read it anyway. No

MoCap Quidditch.

02:28:43.500 --> 02:28:48.500
Well, there already is, there was that motion sensing Tekken 3 thing before.

02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:50.500
Um, no.

02:28:50.500 --> 02:28:52.500
Yeah.

02:28:52.500 --> 02:28:54.500
Keep going.

02:28:54.500 --> 02:28:57.500
MoCap Friday the 13th.

02:29:16.820 --> 02:29:23.820
you can't really motion capture that

02:29:23.820 --> 02:29:27.820
I want mocap shopping.

02:29:27.820 --> 02:29:31.820
You know what, actually, I'll go with that one that Loki recommends here.

02:29:31.820 --> 02:29:33.820
Mocap pole dancing.

02:29:33.820 --> 02:29:36.820
Mocap pole dancing, beautiful.

02:29:36.820 --> 02:29:38.820
Be your own, be the stripper.

02:29:38.820 --> 02:29:40.820
I like that mocap shopping, though.

02:29:40.820 --> 02:29:43.820
That could be, like, they could have snow art on one side and shopping on the other.

02:29:43.820 --> 02:29:44.820
Something for the guys and the girls.

02:29:44.820 --> 02:29:49.820
Mocap supermarket sweep.

02:29:49.820 --> 02:29:51.820
You wanna change your answer?

02:29:51.820 --> 02:29:52.820
Yes.

02:29:52.820 --> 02:29:54.820
I want to change my answer.

02:29:54.820 --> 02:29:56.820
Probably changes from pole dancing to supermarket sweep.

02:29:56.820 --> 02:29:59.820
That show is cool beyond belief.

02:30:02.820 --> 02:30:07.820
Alright, my number one answer, and I can't believe this hasn't already been named, but I think it's the obvious.

02:30:07.820 --> 02:30:09.820
Mocap spanking.

02:30:11.820 --> 02:30:14.820
I thought there was that one game where you actually had this slap.

02:30:14.820 --> 02:30:16.820
Yeah, that one.

02:30:16.820 --> 02:30:19.820
No, you actually shove your finger up your ass. Well, not your ass, but the guy's ass.

02:30:19.820 --> 02:30:21.820
I thought it was actually just me.

02:30:21.820 --> 02:30:23.580
whatever i don't know

02:30:23.580 --> 02:30:27.960
i said well you know what is in the mocap game in any mocap spanking

02:30:27.960 --> 02:30:29.620

02:30:29.620 --> 02:30:33.500
do you want to read what we have so far? so far we have mocap horse racing, mocap drug

02:30:33.500 --> 02:30:37.540

02:30:37.540 --> 02:30:40.720
uh... mocap murder, mocap binge drinking

02:30:40.720 --> 02:30:42.060
mocap girls come wild

02:30:42.060 --> 02:30:44.680

Awwww.

02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:08.540
I just, I don't think you can get the same sensation from a mocap game that you

02:31:08.540 --> 02:31:10.020
could in real life.

02:31:10.020 --> 02:31:13.540
Because...

02:31:13.540 --> 02:31:18.380
unless there's like a strap-on attachment to play, it wouldn't be any fun.

02:31:18.380 --> 02:31:22.040
so next

02:31:22.040 --> 02:31:26.420

02:45:28.780 --> 02:45:29.820
That's a very good answer.

02:45:29.820 --> 02:45:31.440
Do you have a phone number we can call?

02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:32.900
Hey, baby.

02:45:32.900 --> 02:45:38.740
By the way, just between you and me, that's what I'm aiming for for season 3, is the debut

02:45:38.740 --> 02:45:39.740
of the phones.

02:45:39.740 --> 02:45:40.740
Yes.

02:45:40.740 --> 02:45:41.740
Woohoo!

02:45:41.740 --> 02:45:45.160
So when Loki and I move into, because then we'll be able to dedicate a home line, because,

02:45:45.160 --> 02:45:49.820
you know, who cares if Orange Lounge people are calling during the middle of the day?

02:45:49.820 --> 02:45:54.680
The next question comes from 23rd Bank, it's actually for DarkTetia.

02:45:54.680 --> 02:45:59.340
I never asked you if you had to collide Japanese girls in a bucket of chocolate ready whip,

02:45:59.340 --> 02:46:00.340
what would you do?

02:46:00.340 --> 02:46:03.940
Oh my god, I don't know.

02:46:03.940 --> 02:46:09.740
Yeah. What would I not do? That's a good one.

02:46:09.740 --> 02:46:16.580
Our next question comes from Chubbs. Will you be hosting Orange Downs Radio during March Madness, and can I be a guest?

02:46:16.580 --> 02:46:20.060
Yes and yes. When's your next junk show?

02:46:20.060 --> 02:46:24.300
When we have a three-day weekend? Um, probably the Saturday night...

02:46:24.300 --> 02:46:28.620
I got it! I got it! Sunday night after March Madness! Oh, that's right, because you and me have Monday off!

02:46:28.620 --> 02:46:32.420
drunk you and me well the thing is okay this is the interesting thing in two

02:46:32.420 --> 02:46:37.980
weeks orange lounge will be preempted by the live running coverage of March

02:46:37.980 --> 02:46:40.940
madness please help us spread the promotion we want this to be a huge

02:46:40.940 --> 02:46:44.820
internet event we know a lot of you guys aren't in California we know a lot of

02:46:44.820 --> 02:46:48.300
times this show is kind of very localized to California events and stuff

02:46:48.300 --> 02:46:50.900
but if you guys want to get in on this those of you abroad we know we have a

02:46:50.900 --> 02:46:55.420
lot of listeners out on the East Coast Midwest if you want to get in on this

02:46:55.420 --> 02:47:05.420
Listen to our live tournament coverage. It's going to go all day long, and it's just for you guys who are far away, because we figure most people from California are going to be here at the tournament. You'll get to hear everybody.

02:47:05.420 --> 02:47:09.420
And our next trunk show is probably going to be right after that, because we're going to be like, fuck this and get drunk.

02:47:09.420 --> 02:47:14.420
We will probably do a live fuck-off show immediately following the March Madness coverage.

02:47:14.420 --> 02:47:21.420
Well, our next question comes from SkylineDC505. It says, will I pass my drive test this Thursday? Sure.

02:47:21.420 --> 02:47:24.320
I you will pass it with an 80 like I did

02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:26.560
It was the fee

02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:32.640
What type of questions can ask people to make them think I'm interested? I'm sorry. What was it? What type of questions?

02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:34.640
Can I ask people to make them think I'm interested?

02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:37.720
What color panties are you wearing? I?

02:47:39.080 --> 02:47:41.080
Like peanut butter what a fuck

02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:47.720
There you go. That's a great question. Yes, I like peanut butter. Do you want to fuck question mark?

02:47:47.720 --> 02:47:54.720
More Than Jake asks, why won't anybody pick up the phone, because we're not there?

02:47:55.720 --> 02:47:57.720
Send an email, welcome to the new millennium, hi.

02:47:57.720 --> 02:48:01.720
23rd Magus, have any of you actually called 867-5309?

02:48:01.720 --> 02:48:03.720
No, I never have.

02:48:03.720 --> 02:48:04.720
Everybody in their lives?

02:48:04.720 --> 02:48:11.720
But I have called, hey for those of you local in Sacramento in the 916 area code, I have called 332-2222.

02:48:11.720 --> 02:48:13.720
That's all I'm going to say.

02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:20.320
I'll have you know that actually because of that song right there. That's why in every single movie all the phone numbers are five five five

02:48:21.400 --> 02:48:22.920
Yes

02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:28.880
Because five five five no one can have a number with that on it because those are dedicated

02:48:29.080 --> 02:48:34.960
Straight for like the movies and stuff because people like that call that number and in some guy just got knowing

02:48:35.560 --> 02:48:40.560
Totally pissed off at that. You know yeah, I mean really don't you guys watch pop-up video. They said it like 80 times now

02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:44.840
actually I believe if any of you saw the movie punch drunk love

02:48:44.840 --> 02:48:48.000
there's a scene where Adam Sandler's calling like a porn sex line or something and they

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:49.240
use like a real number

02:48:49.240 --> 02:48:53.160
what they did is that Hollywood bought like that 800 number and then like put

02:48:53.160 --> 02:48:54.640
an advertisement for the movie on it

02:48:54.640 --> 02:49:00.720
so that's kinda funny. JB asks can I talk on the order of March Madness I will hypnotize you I will

02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:02.000
stife him talk more hahaha

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:05.300
yes any okay this is the interesting thing

02:49:05.300 --> 02:49:09.120
if March Madness gets set up like we hope it does

02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:12.720
we're not gonna be like tucked away in the corner like way the back we will be

02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:13.360
able to see us

02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:17.280
we're hoping that we're gonna have if if the tourney is outdoors like we're

02:49:17.280 --> 02:49:19.160
thinking it's going to be provided it's not raining

02:49:19.160 --> 02:49:22.660
we're hoping that the gazebo is going to be orange lounge and if any of you have been to

02:49:22.660 --> 02:49:25.600
Scandia and see the gazebo out back it's huge you won't miss us

02:49:25.600 --> 02:49:28.920
so come on by it's gonna be open open door all day so

02:49:28.920 --> 02:49:32.720
nobody else needs to ask that yes you can be on the show just come on by and say hi

02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:36.720
will you guys be here in the summer for CBN too so can I be a guest that's from Rice?

02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:46.720
Give me some dates, as long as I can afford it. I don't see why not. Yeah, I have not heard anything about CBN2.

02:49:46.720 --> 02:49:56.720
Because we already know there's going to be B3 May 17th and 18th, and definitely going to be there, so you should be there too.

02:49:56.720 --> 02:50:12.720
May is a little before summer, though. I imagine Cyberbeat, they wouldn't want to do that more than twice a year, if even that, so I would think that January, probably July would be the earliest they'd want to do that. So, I don't know. Give us dates, we'll see.

02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:19.920
and another one from a jazz what are each of our favorite extreme songs first

02:50:19.920 --> 02:50:25.260
and I don't really play extreme that much but and and because I would

02:50:25.260 --> 02:50:29.900
normally name anything that tack does I'm actually gonna go with guacamole del

02:50:29.900 --> 02:50:37.320
taco contrary to what a lot of people see me play I actually seem to like be

02:50:37.320 --> 02:50:44.320
a lot more than I put on. I always play A on doubles only because the steps are fun.

02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:53.840
And people like watching you run around the pad really fast. They're like, ooh, arrows

02:50:53.840 --> 02:51:00.840
going up the screen

02:51:02.920 --> 02:51:06.980
okay and so what's the make a comment on

02:51:06.980 --> 02:51:09.920
the definitely beer butter

02:51:09.920 --> 02:51:14.200
okay that i don't get on extreme

02:51:14.200 --> 02:51:16.260
the corporate they love you dot

02:51:16.260 --> 02:51:18.280

okay don't laugh okay don't laugh alright

02:51:21.200 --> 02:51:24.700
gianna gianna doubles that is a

02:51:24.700 --> 02:51:27.040
i love it

02:51:27.040 --> 02:51:30.380
it's like

02:51:30.380 --> 02:51:31.760
uh...

02:51:31.760 --> 02:51:33.460
i'm stuck between

02:51:33.460 --> 02:51:35.100
mobile again

02:51:35.100 --> 02:51:38.280
uh...

02:51:38.280 --> 02:51:40.460
evictions

02:51:40.460 --> 02:51:42.300
rhythm police of those days

02:51:42.300 --> 02:51:43.700
rule

02:51:43.700 --> 02:51:45.460
you pick sides

02:51:45.460 --> 02:51:47.180
uh... i

02:51:47.180 --> 02:51:50.720
I'm gonna call me Fag, but I do, I do, I do. I love that song.

02:51:50.720 --> 02:51:52.920
Fag?

02:51:52.920 --> 02:51:55.160
He said so!

02:51:55.160 --> 02:51:59.600
Okay, and Rob, can he stay at your house with your mic?

02:51:59.600 --> 02:52:03.720
Uh, I think so, yeah, I still haven't run that by Brian for sure, but I have told

02:52:03.720 --> 02:52:06.560
him there is a tournament and people will probably be here.

02:52:06.560 --> 02:52:10.360
Yeah, I'm pretty sure, let's just say yes, if there's a change that I'll let you know.

02:52:10.360 --> 02:52:15.380
And then... He's pretty cool with stuff like that. If he wants to know if I can legally become his cousin,

02:52:15.380 --> 02:52:17.180
We could try.

02:52:17.180 --> 02:52:18.500
I'm adopting you anyway, so...

02:52:18.500 --> 02:52:22.260
Interesting. How would that work?

02:52:22.260 --> 02:52:24.780
Your aunt would have to adopt me.

02:52:24.780 --> 02:52:28.900
What about, could your aunt adopt him? Do you have an aunt?

02:52:28.900 --> 02:52:30.340
I have a bunch of aunts, but...

02:52:30.340 --> 02:52:33.660
Could one of them, you don't want them to adopt J.B.? You'd rather be adopted by J.B.

02:52:33.660 --> 02:52:37.820
I'm scared of my family, so...

02:52:37.820 --> 02:52:39.420
Okay, so you'll try.

02:52:39.420 --> 02:52:42.700
Maybe, maybe you can go on the People's Court and make that happen.

02:52:42.700 --> 02:52:46.140
Let's go to people's court and have them legally make us cousins.

02:52:46.140 --> 02:52:49.700
This is the plaintiff.

02:52:49.700 --> 02:52:51.180
And then...

02:52:51.180 --> 02:52:58.180
And then, can I kill A.T.T. Comcast? No, A.T.T. can go, but Comcast is actually doing good service for me.

02:52:58.580 --> 02:53:00.620
You can come over here and use my cable.

02:53:00.620 --> 02:53:01.980
23 Megas.

02:53:01.980 --> 02:53:05.520
Can I put a big sign on the gazebo that says Orange Doms Temple of Butt?

02:53:05.520 --> 02:53:06.500
No.

02:53:06.500 --> 02:53:09.900
No, because it's Scandia Family Fun Center.

02:53:09.900 --> 02:53:12.900
If we shake hands at marshmallows, does that make one of us outface?

02:53:12.900 --> 02:53:16.900
And that's the DT.

02:53:16.900 --> 02:53:18.900
Um, no.

02:53:18.900 --> 02:53:20.900
Yeah, sure.

02:53:20.900 --> 02:53:23.900
Ask us more questions, we have one more minute.

02:53:23.900 --> 02:53:25.900
Waste time, waste time, waste time.

02:53:25.900 --> 02:53:31.900
Does anybody in the room have a question for anyone else that they want to ask live on air?

02:53:31.900 --> 02:53:34.900
I didn't mean to say that, but yeah.

02:53:34.900 --> 02:53:36.900
I was answering a question, yeah.

02:53:36.900 --> 02:53:38.900
That's why I said the evil name.

02:53:38.900 --> 02:53:42.520
hey we have question from Japan and yay

02:53:42.520 --> 02:54:07.420

02:54:07.420 --> 02:54:11.420
Japan Man. Back to Japan Man.

02:54:11.420 --> 02:54:15.420
Does 1, 2, 3, 4 Max 300's owner suck?

02:54:15.420 --> 02:54:19.420
Really? Bad. Awful piece of shit.

02:54:19.420 --> 02:54:20.420
It was created in the Temple of Butt.

02:54:20.420 --> 02:54:22.420
Worse than T-word.

02:54:22.420 --> 02:54:23.420
Hi guys!

02:54:23.420 --> 02:54:25.420
Hi! Hi guys!

02:54:28.420 --> 02:54:31.420
That Track 16 one.

02:54:31.420 --> 02:54:33.420
Ah, You Leave Me Alone.

02:54:33.420 --> 02:54:37.940

02:54:37.940 --> 02:54:39.500

so stay tuned for a bit

02:55:01.820 --> 02:55:03.820
You know what? That does it.

02:55:03.820 --> 02:55:05.820
Let's get to the last question. We'll cut it off.

02:55:05.820 --> 02:55:07.820
Oh, we'll get to the last question.

02:55:07.820 --> 02:55:09.820
Then I don't know. It was just a moment.

02:55:09.820 --> 02:55:11.820
Are you in joy?

02:55:11.820 --> 02:55:13.820
Yes.

02:55:13.820 --> 02:55:15.820
Are we in joy?

02:55:15.820 --> 02:55:17.820
Final thoughts? Time.

02:55:17.820 --> 02:55:19.820
Final thoughts?

02:55:19.820 --> 02:55:21.820
I'm still going to play that song anyway.

02:55:21.820 --> 02:55:25.820
Don't fall down and hurt yourself.

02:55:25.820 --> 02:55:27.820
I don't have any.

02:55:27.820 --> 02:55:29.820
I'm sorry. I don't have any.

02:55:29.820 --> 02:55:31.820
How about you?

02:55:31.820 --> 02:55:36.820
I have to go homework on my website and my anime ezine that I have to do for my work.

02:55:36.820 --> 02:55:42.820
Full peanut butter cups are harder to throw than just wrappers.

02:55:42.820 --> 02:55:46.820
I have to go to work tomorrow and I really don't want to.

02:55:46.820 --> 02:55:54.820
I don't know nothing.

02:55:54.820 --> 02:55:58.820
If you ever go to Chico, beware the sheep, they're all sluts.

02:55:58.820 --> 02:56:02.820
Will someone fuck me if I just lie there?

02:56:06.820 --> 02:56:10.820
No comment.

02:56:10.820 --> 02:56:14.820
Do you really want somebody to answer that, Rob?

02:56:14.820 --> 02:56:18.820
Maybe. And on that note, bye everybody!
