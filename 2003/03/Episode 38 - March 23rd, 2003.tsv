193993	194894	It's okay to talk on the mic.
195475	196977	Quit giving head to the propel and talk.
197537	200160	It's not going to hurt you.
200521	201582	Oh my god, it's cute.
201622	202363	He's turning purple.
202823	204946	Whoa, he's getting really red.
205787	208670	Wearing a lovely Jolly Rancher face is...
211957	213478	Okay, we also have some other guests coming.
213498	214599	They're just not here yet.
214759	219383	A rice princess is somewhere in the house, but she must be... Oh, she went to get food.
219483	220463	We have DDRholic coming.
220704	223406	And then we also have Asian Innovations coming.

224547	224887	And Dark Child.
225007	225567	And Dark Child.
225868	226368	That'll be fun.
226388	226708	If they get here.
227048	227569	If they get here.
228069	228950	Hopefully they didn't get lost.
228990	230391	You did draw them a good map, right?
230651	231131	Of course.
231272	231592	Of course.
231832	234734	I gave written directions and then I drew a map that said which house it was.
235315	236716	Because I didn't remember your house number.
237771	238792	Oh, okay.
239893	243375	Rob lives at blank, blank, blank, blankity, blank, blank.
243435	243955	Hey, you know what?
243995	247137	I'm moving in a month, so it won't matter.
248418	249279	Yeah, he probably don't.
249439	250900	He thinks Pomani's weird enough as it is.
250940	252901	Oh my god, it's this guy's house.
252921	254002	Oh my god, oh my god.
255481	262330	Alright, we'll be talking about tons of stuff a little bit more later, including announcing the March Madness 2DX qualifiers.
262710	267015	We'll talk to Mike Ngo, we'll talk to everybody, but first, Daikin Kai, the long version.
267076	267816	Enjoy, we'll be back.
313230	313791	Music, Music,

389964	391186	I'm just a boy, I got beat!
391206	392608	I'm just a boy, I got beat!
392668	393749	I'm just a boy, I got beat!

554525	555628	Thank you for watching
576624	578105	Hi everybody, this is DSDS.
578145	581927	Make sure to visit SoCalKicks.com and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
582147	585149	We finally accomplished ultimate evolution just now.
586170	588491	Hello everybody, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
588972	591353	Live here for episode number 38.
592173	593394	Whatever happened to SoCalKicks?
593414	597216	I hardly ever see him in the chair anymore.
597377	598117	Quit eating everybody.
598197	598637	I'm just kidding.
599718	599938	Anyway.
600178	602480	No, my fur!
602520	603921	It's kind of a crazy house tonight.
603941	603981	No!
604241	604421	No!
606781	610323	Everybody's all hyper.
611343	613164	Everybody's all hyper about the Oscars.
613204	618247	Yeah, because Spirited Away fucking won.
618487	619448	That's all that matters.
622029	623010	I have to make a new ad.
623870	624631	What are they called again?
624651	625831	They came up with the best name.
626372	626792	Shingles.
627292	628393	Yes, the Pringles.
628413	629673	That tastes like shit.
630754	632095	Everybody, go to this address.
632175	632655	Rob, type it up.
637231	642133	www.sakuramani.com slash scattles.
642453	643113	No, I take that back.
643133	643513	They're not there.
644213	644534	Go back.
645394	645674	Go back.
647655	648775	It's not www anything.
649375	657818	Members.aol.com slash darksakura slash scattles dot jpg.
658818	659419	I think that's it.
659759	660639	I might want to click it to see if it works.
662253	666915	That's what I do when I'm bored, is I take products and then make, like, foul approximates of them.
667835	669415	It's either .jpg or .gif.
672196	672496	I don't know.
672776	674097	But that's what I do when I get bored.
674417	675477	I find neat products.
676037	676918	It is .jpg.
679158	680099	No, not neat.
680499	683700	I find products and then I make them, um, a little bit different.
684840	688001	You should have made them all brown, though, instead of, like... What?
689262	689982	I'm being summoned.
690746	691268	DarkSakura.com
696540	697180	Yes.
698441	699322	Question from the chat room.
699362	702623	Did the Disney version of Spirited Away win or did the original Japanese one?
702683	704725	Well, it would be the Disney one.
704845	708407	But that's because... Well, I don't really know why that is.
708467	712269	I think that's just because to the Oscars it's the same movie.
712669	713809	Just a different language track.
713830	714890	But it's still the same visual.
714990	715310	I don't know.
715671	716571	But yeah, the Disney one won.
719252	719673	Anyway.
720013	722334	Wow, what a busy week.
722454	723395	I'm so exhausted.
723635	724555	I was impressed.
724715	725636	She pronounced his name right.
726698	727839	She probably had a lot of training.
727859	729721	Cameron Diaz probably had to be coached backstage.
729741	732124	Can I just give somebody heads?
732384	732745	Anyway.
743875	759999	This is going to be the second tournament I've done that's been around times of unemployment for me.
760740	761680	Give me a job!
764601	765501	That lion is demonic.
765661	766341	The lion is demonic.
768202	772623	Yes, we have March Madness coming up, which by the way means there will be no live show next Sunday because...
773723	776245	will be live all day, Saturday and Sunday.
776365	777706	I'll be all over the freaking place.
777986	778567	Oh my god.
779227	782710	It's gonna be like Shaft was, except I get to do it for two days.
783283	787564	And Loki, once again, gets to head up taking the reins all by himself.
788104	789605	Hey, what are you guys doing?
790345	796227	I will be helping you 90% of the time, but I have to emcee the 2DX tournament.
796367	799628	And then I'm going to be participating in one event, but I can't say what.
799648	800588	I'm doing everything else.
801729	802569	You're doing everything else?
802589	803609	Well, just on the admin side.
803689	803849	Yes.
804269	805510	But you'll be by to say hello, right?
805530	809311	Getting volunteers, offering them potato chips and not paying anybody.
810915	812777	You'll say hi on the show, right?
812797	814418	Of course.
816259	817019	It'll be like this.
821923	826386	What's going to be really cool about March Madness is that the machine's going to be set up outside, from what I understand.
826426	829388	For those of you that are worried about glare, don't worry about it.
829408	831389	The staff's already thought about it.
831409	835472	They're going to set it up in this tent thing with a lot of tarp, and they're going to set it perpendicular to the sun.
835732	837973	They have this all worked out, so don't worry.
838194	840275	You won't be able to get any glare on that.
840715	847939	So, but what's cool about that, this is the machines outside, we're going to be, for any of those that have ever been to Scandia before, we're going to be out in the gazebo.
848339	850460	So, you can't miss us.
850821	853602	This is what's cool about Scandia, letting us do that tournament there.
853642	856664	They cancelled all the parties, so we could have the party room and the gazebo.
857064	858645	And Orange Lounge gets the gazebo, so that's pretty cool.
860266	863708	Children, screw your birthday, we're having a DDR tournament.
864508	872271	Word of advice, if you're coming down to the tournament at Sacramento Scandia, and we hope you are, come early, because it's going to fill up fast.
872311	878874	Like the parking lot I'm talking about, because there's a lot of people expected to show up next Saturday between the normal patrons and the DDR tournament.
879334	882315	So come early to be sure that you can actually park nearby.
883756	884696	What are you mewing about?
884756	886677	I just wanted to see what you noticed.
890542	891143	So how was your week?
891163	891984	What'd you do this week, Jamie?
894245	894886	Screwed cats?
894986	895246	What?
896787	897788	I didn't do shit.
899029	899589	What's that, Jamie?
899689	900410	Timmy's caught in a well?
908316	909316	What's that, Timmy?
910777	911098	Timmy?
912859	913820	Fuck it, I fucked it up!
915862	916242	What's that?
916283	917344	Timmy's caught in your ass?
917484	917684	What?
919405	919806	Gotcha.
920446	921427	Do anything fun this week, Jamie?
922108	922869	Went to a party.
923029	923830	Watched Battle Royale.
924090	927253	Yes, last night was the big party at Zero's house.
927353	928174	We watched Battle Royale.
928214	929355	You know, I still miss the beginning.
929415	935541	Every time I start to watch that movie, I either catch it in parts because I have to go to the bathroom and do the whole thing, or I miss the very beginning.
936241	937362	And I miss the beginning again.
937923	938884	Was that the special edition?
939264	940045	Or just the normal?
942459	945401	I need a special edition now because there's a bunch of scenes that they cut out.
945721	947302	Was this the song from the credits?
947522	949203	This song that you had very first on pre-show night?
949323	950424	Because somebody recognized it.
952905	954726	Somebody in the chat room recognized it when it first played.
954806	956868	I downloaded it last night when I got home.
960270	964391	Very cool.
964631	968033	I didn't even know what to expect when I saw that movie.
968053	969733	Did you know about it?
969933	971094	No, I didn't even know anything about it.
971194	976095	I didn't even drink last night, so I was actually perfectly sober watching the movie, which at a party is actually a pretty rarity for me.
976935	978416	But I'm just kind of sitting there going, I don't know.
978576	980297	Everybody was arguing about what movie you want to watch.
980317	981317	Some people want to watch Battle Royale.
981337	983217	Some people want to watch, what was it called, The Swimmers?
983658	984378	The Water Boys.
985578	996504	If you want to know more about Battle Royale, now the site does have a good bit of spoilers, but it's a very in-depth site, one of the best I found.
997005	1000707	Go to BattleRoyaleOnline.com
1002308	1006610	and it actually is R-O-Y-A-L-E You know what?
1006730	1014374	I was curious because in the background of the training video how they had www.br.com I'm wondering if that's... I went to that site.
1014434	1014895	It wasn't there.
1015475	1017056	How about br.co.jp?
1017416	1017956	I didn't try that.
1018277	1019837	Try br.co.jp.
1020558	1021138	Oh, br.co.jp.
1021158	1022179	Uh-huh.
1022299	1023559	Because there was not a br.com.
1023620	1023920	I looked.
1024660	1027001	Uh, probably not.
1028362	1028602	No.
1029243	1029703	But, um...
1030905	1031085	Nope.
1031826	1035169	But try that site, BattleRoyaleOnline.com.
1035349	1035689	Okay.
1036290	1038692	Explain the premise of Battle Royale, because we're talking about this movie.
1038712	1040493	We haven't talked about what it's about, for those that don't know.
1040553	1043696	Children do not respect their elders, and the world is thrown into chaos.
1046118	1054125	So they enact this thing called the Battle Royale Act, where they take a randomly pulled class of students... And put them in Iraq.
1054835	1064723	and put them on a deserted island and have them kill each other until there's one left and they have these little collars that make their necks explode in cool bloody ways
1065991	1067292	That was cool, but I like that guy.
1067332	1068653	It was a really violent movie.
1068753	1075358	Like, if you like young children and violence... I like the guy that joined up for fun.
1075598	1077059	That guy kicked ass.
1077340	1077960	Oh my god.
1078340	1080262	Yeah, I like the fact that... Sorry, Misako was the best one.
1080482	1082263	I like the fact that they're in 8th grade.
1082904	1084885	The slut was the coolest person.
1085506	1094092	I nominate for best student on the island for the males is gonna go to the guy that joined up for fun, and then of course, you know, best female would be the slut, yeah.
1095492	1097093	I was going to say something profound about the movie.
1097113	1098013	She got six kills.
1098594	1103417	That site that I just told you about, it has character profiles for like six of them.
1104677	1109100	And it actually has the cool slut girl's profile, including her family history and everything.
1109720	1111061	She was a prostitute.
1111661	1112802	And she was pimping out other girls.
1115844	1119826	And she got six kills in the movie.
1121338	1146397	and actually this site is really cool because it has pictures of all of the scorecards so that's really cool and you know what's interesting about that movie what makes it a lot more fun if you imagine it being like 8th graders from your local Roseville Golf Land or your local arcade that pisses you off and then every time they run in front of that area between the pad and the machine that little necklace goes off and they explode hey I'd join up for fun to kill them
1147540	1150702	Yeah, the best thing about that movie, it had the whole 90210 effect.
1150923	1152224	You have eighth graders that are like 30.
1154745	1155646	And you have your different types.
1155666	1157187	You have the slut, you have the prep.
1157828	1160009	Then you have the loner guy, and you have the nerds.
1160370	1161771	Yeah, the nerds were the best.
1162211	1162952	The nerds were so cool.
1162972	1165894	I want a pot lid to kill people with, because that would be so cool.
1165914	1166695	The pot lid saved him.
1167075	1168296	I know, that was the coolest part.
1170237	1172079	I still think Gak did the best, he kicked ass.
1172099	1172259	Oh yeah.
1173308	1177852	You might want to talk about Battle Royale 2, because you're given the website for it in the chatroom right now by Jazz.
1177892	1180253	Actually, if you can get the link out of my live journal and post it in there.
1180354	1180554	Sure.
1180614	1183036	Actually, Jazz just posted it in the chatroom for our convenience.
1183916	1184577	Ah, thank you.
1187140	1193725	Battle Royale 2 is set after, of course, Battle Royale, about three years afterwards, with the survivor.
1194265	1197487	And actually the other, I don't want to go into detail.
1197587	1197848	Right.
1197968	1200650	There's another character who makes an important cameo, as far as I know.
1201310	1202751	On that side, though, there's a cool thing.
1202791	1205033	They have scenes of their rehearsal.
1206854	1208075	I want to play with your pussy.
1209436	1211597	Jamie, please stop playing with Irene's pussy on the show.
1211617	1212438	Ooh, can I fist your pussy?
1212458	1212658	Yeah.
1215049	1218230	Can you describe what the pussy is here, for those that are shocked and amazed right now?
1218550	1219430	Dead cat.
1219450	1220531	Where did you get that from?
1220791	1221591	Hot gothic.
1222131	1223572	A long time ago, like three years ago.
1223632	1224012	Oh, man.
1224092	1224492	Yeah, I know.
1224532	1225432	It's so cute.
1225772	1226693	Yeah, and it's dead.
1226753	1229294	It's got X's for eyes, and it's got a pink tongue.
1229694	1231754	I have a panda for you at my house, by the way.
1232495	1233635	Oh, thank you.
1234075	1236896	It's got an opening where the pussy is.
1237296	1238216	And it's pink inside.
1238296	1240017	Yeah, the interior is pink.
1240397	1241357	It's really cool.
1242238	1242698	Or whatever.
1245256	1246937	That was a lovely image, I'm sure.
1247297	1249799	I'm sure our listeners are happy that we could share that with all of you.
1249819	1250559	There's my cell phone.
1251700	1252460	Here, somebody talk.
1253121	1254621	Oh, I bet that's my... Oh, we're lost.
1257883	1262926	So anyway, we need to fill a little more time here.
1263046	1264687	Let's look at this profile, this one chick.
1264927	1270411	I guess the chick that makes a cameo in the beginning of Battle Royale 1 has a full part in the second movie.
1270431	1271011	That should be fun.
1273260	1273700	Yes, they are.
1273780	1274801	Oh, what the hell is this?
1275641	1279282	There's some chick that looks like a Barbie doll that Chaz put in the chatroom.
1280022	1281223	Yeah, it looks like Christina Aguilera.
1282703	1283403	That's scary.
1284624	1284924	Anyway.
1285664	1287184	Alright, enough about Battle Royale.
1287405	1288145	Somebody wants to take the mic.
1288185	1288385	Hi.
1288405	1290285	You should have Dragon Ash in the next one.
1293026	1294647	So, how was your week, Loki?
1294667	1295007	What'd you do?
1295737	1297078	I worked on the website.
1297138	1301019	Yes, I know, there's nothing on there new right now.
1301359	1304540	But trust me, tomorrow you're going to be seeing differently.
1305281	1307381	Yeah, I was busy downloading shit.
1307401	1311683	I was actually trying to organize all my sim files because now I'm up to 2446.
1313524	1321387	And I was just putting them in the official categories and CD tagging them and all that kind of stuff.
1321547	1321847	So...
1323720	1324881	That's what I've been working on.
1326061	1332565	So there should be a huge update, and then I'll finally start doing more regular updates, but they'll be obviously much smaller than this.
1333906	1345614	But what will be coming up hopefully tomorrow, if I am able to zip everything up tonight, would be all the official sets for DDR, everything from first through extreme.
1345934	1347475	So everything that's done so far.
1348615	1348756	Nope.
1348776	1348836	God.
1377114	1406250	and a lot of times people just either make heavy steps or they'll just make basic steps and really annoying shit like that so you have to go back and fix them so that's what I'm hoping to do also with releasing files on my site is it'll allow me to go in and check these files and be able to fix them because you know obviously put them on the internet I want to make sure that they're nice and fixed they have nice backgrounds you know with artists named in the banners and all that wonderful stuff so that's what I'll be working on and
1406910	1414939	You know, just to forewarn everyone, because obviously I'm sure people will be noticing this, all the sim files, you know, the official sets, are not created by me.
1415179	1429414	Yes, I know, shocker, I didn't have the time to create, thousands and thousands of sim files are already done, and already synced, so, you know, I'm just sticking them on my website in case some of these other websites go down, or it's just another place to find them, you know, bandwidth-wise or whatever.
1431047	1432228	Hi, welcome back, DarkSakura.
1432408	1438497	But there will be some official stuff that will be exclusive to my site, such as the solo non-stops.
1438957	1443824	Those are going to be all done by me, and those are not anywhere to be found on the internet.
1443904	1445085	Very cool, very cool.
1445746	1446286	That's about it.
1446406	1454011	But if you're looking for DDR Extreme stuff and pretty much anything else right now, two sites you can look at would be Abomani Style.
1454211	1456132	They've got a lot of the stuff on there.
1456472	1464837	Or DDR UK, they've just opened their download section again to everyone instead of just level 2 members or whatever like that.
1465258	1466738	So you can go download everything.
1468239	1475182	I swear by Lawrence on that site because he thinks files better than anyone.
1476143	1484766	But I took his files and put the CD tags for Bomani, so I just like their CD tags better.
1484826	1485206	I don't know.
1485767	1486467	This is picky, but.
1487452	1491074	They're all up, or they will be all up tomorrow as soon as I upload them.
1491114	1493136	And there's going to be a change with how you download them.
1493556	1497138	It's going to be all through FTP now instead of just through the website.
1497178	1499600	Because one, it'll allow me to update it faster.
1499620	1505764	And two, the FTP's unregulated as far as bandwidth-wise and the website.
1507205	1509426	Normally, you have unlimited bandwidth.
1509726	1513867	They do watch if your site uses a lot of bandwidth, they're going to close you down.
1514047	1519109	And unfortunately, my site is shared with Stepmania.com and a bunch of other ones.
1519489	1523370	So I don't want those going down, so I'm going to take measures to prevent that.
1524270	1526171	Very cool.
1526291	1527211	Question from the chat room.
1527231	1529392	Brack2000 wants to know, are you going to post announcer files?
1531233	1532733	No, actually, I could probably do that.
1533233	1533753	I have those.
1534434	1535454	Well, he wants them.
1536004	1537465	Well, maybe.
1538045	1538886	Maybe later this week.
1539006	1540106	What does it feel to want?
1540166	1540687	I made a tower.
1560672	1561193	Another call?
1562013	1563214	People, turn your phones off!
1563895	1564435	I'm just kidding.
1564675	1565056	I'm kidding.
1565196	1567218	I had my phone off, but Mike would not know where we were.
1567498	1568519	Was Mike here?
1568819	1569199	Yeah.
1569439	1570020	But he's not here.
1571181	1572102	He got ice cream?
1573363	1573863	Did he get me?
1574344	1575244	Did he get me ice cream?
1575625	1577006	Know what else I did this week?
1577026	1578127	We need something sweet.
1579443	1581444	I went and saw Dreamcatcher.
1582044	1582625	Was that any good?
1583065	1585506	Well, the final flight of Osiris was kick-ass.
1585886	1594871	Dreamcatcher, well, Dreamcatcher was a lot of fart jokes, bad acting, and a giant worm alien that speaks with a British accent.
1598109	1599810	I don't understand that at all.
1600070	1600871	Good night, Angel.
1600891	1602472	Mr. Grey, he speaks to the British.
1602692	1607435	But it's hilarious, they've got one part in the movie, because obviously all the aliens look like these giant worm things.
1607915	1615120	Well, they make themselves look like, you know, the traditional looking alien, the grey humanoid thing with the weird eyes.
1615640	1624746	So, basically there's one scene in the movie where they're going to destroy the alien ship, and you see all these aliens going, No, don't hurt us, we don't... What was it like, though?
1625026	1626007	We're not infected.
1626167	1626788	Don't hurt us.
1626828	1627609	We're not... Right.
1646089	1649673	But yeah, Dreamcatcher, it was decent.
1650174	1651235	I wouldn't go see it again.
1651976	1654519	And, well, actually, it kind of sucked ass.
1655620	1664550	But, next week, The Core comes out, and that is going to really suck ass, so don't go see that one.
1667006	1673490	Alright, um, why don't we go to a quick break, I guess, unless, or is there any other sim news you want to talk about, Loki?
1674030	1674831	Things going on in the sim world?
1675651	1681695	Uh, well, just, that made me as, you know, obviously the CS, watch for the CSV updates for that.
1682075	1687058	Last one they had was from the 6th, so it's a couple weeks old, but they're working on it.
1687218	1696023	And Bomani sells, you know, if you're looking for, like, other sim file stuff, like, you know, for 2DX and that kind of thing, Bomani sells got some, uh, you know, Bomani,
1696424	1698954	They're really working on their Bomani
1702435	1703656	on their Bomani sim files.
1703676	1706917	They've got like a lot of 2DX stuff on there and Beatmania 3 and whatnot.
1706977	1713101	So check them out for everything else because they will have like one of the most complete sim file collections.
1713741	1719004	But DDRUK will probably have the best synced DDR DWIs.
1719104	1720144	So, I don't know.
1721085	1723966	Then of course there's my site which will have just a lot of shit.
1724126	1725407	A whole bunch of stuff on there.
1726668	1726808	So...
1727748	1728248	All right, cool.
1728468	1732610	We're going to go to a break, and we'll be back in a little bit.
1733010	1737372	We're going to do this break, we'll do... I don't know, what song can we do?
1738133	1739193	Let's do something... Wait, wait, wait!
1739213	1739353	I know!
1739373	1739493	What?
1740033	1740874	Play my song.
1741214	1741794	Oh, scary.
1741834	1744055	Okay, we'll play something that Loki wants us to play.
1746336	1746656	Okay.
1747377	1747557	Here.
1748437	1750078	Da-da-da-da-da.
1752586	1758968	We're loading up a really cool remix I just found on Monty Sims a while ago.
1873362	1876589	Kala kala kuta kuta kuta eh oh eh oh
2001762	2002344	Carameldansen

2168412	2168953	Hello.
2168973	2169933	That woman is scary.
2170033	2170594	I saw her.

2171695	2173616	The, um, the, uh, Ganguro.
2173776	2174077	Okay.
2174537	2175978	Oh, the chick we were just looking at from Battle Royale 2?
2176018	2176198	Yeah.
2176439	2176959	Oh, okay.
2177239	2178220	No, show that picture.
2178320	2178600	Go back.

2178981	2179201	Show her.
2179341	2179701	Here we go.
2179861	2180622	She is scary.
2180642	2181483	She's gonna be in Battle Royale 2.
2182324	2183524	She looks like Christina Aguilera.
2184545	2188186	She's what's referred to as Ganguro.
2190347	2193448	You know, the super tan, the uber blonde in the panda makeup.
2194589	2194849	Ah.
2197250	2199071	Which, from what I understand, are now a dying breed.
2201712	2201972	So.
2202112	2203212	I got that a long time ago.
2203232	2204913	Paul.

2226885	2227346	Yeah, it is on.
2227766	2227986	Okay.
2228926	2231967	Because if yours is off, then this one's off too, and that would be bad.
2232668	2235389	Okay, so I'll turn it off.
2238855	2241196	Are you here to promote anything tonight, by chance?

2329511	2335414	That's pretty kinky.
2338516	2340617	Also, we have another special guest in the house.
2341297	2342918	Many of you guys maybe have heard of him before.
2343778	2344479	Give it up for...
2345578	2352484	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2371587	2375829	Yeah, I'll remind you, he's been playing since DDR used to cost $18,000 a machine.
2377110	2377670	It's been that long.
2379151	2382532	But back on topic, yeah, it costs $18,000 a play.
2383633	2385854	Are you here promoting anything tonight, DJ Chow?
2387795	2391176	I'm promoting that right now I'm still, most of the way, single.
2391957	2393998	So, yeah, I'm promoting myself.
2394018	2394418	Most of the way?
2394458	2396239	Who's got your other part?
2396319	2397099	Got your back cover?
2397259	2399900	Her name's Susie, but there's nothing official yet, so I don't know.
2400000	2400981	I think I'm still single.
2402779	2404219	So if you want to come on down to March Madness.
2406600	2406860	Yeah.
2409461	2411701	Alright, there's a tournament coming up, March Madness.
2413441	2416902	If any of you watch NCAA college basketball, you already know the format.
2417522	2418903	If not, let me break it down for you.
2419743	2423744	It's like the WWF, 64 Hell in a Cell match.
2424044	2424624	No, not really.
2425184	2427625	It's going to be 64 people, all in bracketed play.
2429465	2433227	and basically you score off head to head against each other.
2433327	2435448	You will be seeded like the NCAA tournament.
2436208	2442731	So basically if you're from SoCal and NorCal or any other state, we're going to try to keep you guys separate from one another.
2444511	2448753	We're basically going to take your abilities and we're going to rank you accordingly.
2450994	2453515	and every match will be one song only.
2454135	2456615	And the person with more perfects will advance to the next round.
2457415	2462697	And the winner must win six grueling matches because I will make it especially tough for you.
2465317	2468838	As a hint, I guess I'll... Okay, there's 64 matches.
2468998	2471618	I will tell you one song in the tournament you guys should practice.
2472419	2473199	Practice bag.
2475299	2475759	Tee hee.
2477620	2478600	No, I hate that song.
2481363	2481644	All right.
2482124	2483507	I'm being told about freestyle.
2483527	2484989	You want to talk about freestyle?
2485390	2485650	Yeah.
2485710	2486932	The way freestyle's going to go down?
2488054	2488675	Yeah.
2488795	2490658	I'm also taking freestyle to a new level.
2490858	2493162	I want to get some reality DDR going.
2494156	2497159	So we're basing it off American Idol with DDR Idol.
2499261	2503345	I haven't released this yet, but I will tell you guys the judges now since we're only one week away.
2503605	2504766	Ooh, okay, let's hear it.
2505527	2509150	Alright, of course you guys all know Simon, Paula, and Randy.
2509971	2511613	Our versions of Simon, Paula, and Randy.
2512213	2514435	I'll start with... Randy.
2515536	2524961	He is someone that has the GDR credentials, he's someone that has won tournaments, and he's someone that uses dog in every sentence.
2525481	2533385	So, we can't go wrong, it's Mel B. Oh, yes, wait, wait, I think we might have a little clip of Mel B here somewhere.
2535026	2536326	Alright, this is Mel B of our team.
2536346	2537127	Yeah, there we go.
2538430	2538910	That's right.
2539651	2540212	That's right.
2541873	2543815	Alright, on to Paula.
2544135	2545856	Some of you might know her, some of you might not.
2546837	2548278	She's a SoCal DDR player.
2548459	2549299	I know Paula Abdul.
2550000	2551441	Yeah.
2552642	2554584	She also goes by the handle...
2555558	2559643	She also goes by the handle GoodAttackGirl Her name is Angela Is she sweet?
2559983	2570835	Yeah, she is Okay That's all that's important Yeah She'll try to keep Simon in check Alright, good Alright, many of you have been wondering Who is Simon gonna be?
2572239	2575900	Many people have wanted to be Simon, including our own Loki kept begging.
2575940	2577421	We got people in the chatroom begging.
2578141	2579861	But it's already been sealed, right?
2579881	2581442	The deal's been sealed a long time ago, right?
2581622	2581822	Yes.
2582022	2583542	You signed a deal with the devil.
2583642	2587544	Basically, before the tournament even started, I secured my Simon.
2588284	2591625	Because if I would have gotten this person a Simon, I think this tournament would have been on hold.
2593486	2597388	This is someone that won't be afraid to tell you to your face that you suck shit.
2598810	2602872	He'll tell you to your face that he'll never want to see you on the DDR platform ever again.
2604314	2609878	This person will also tell you not to ever put a quarter in the machine.
2610858	2611939	He'll tell you that you're ugly.
2613020	2614521	He'll tell you that your routine was ugly.
2615382	2616562	He'll tell you you can't dance.
2617543	2619825	He'll tell you you're the worst dancer in America.
2621340	2625924	He might even tell you he might be the worst DDR player in the world, or even the universe.
2628426	2631048	But I don't think I'll tell you guys, because I want to keep the suspense for a week.
2632269	2632789	Oh, come on.
2633169	2633610	Just a hint?
2634871	2636092	Okay, I think you guys should know.
2636212	2637272	Alright, yeah, yeah, tell us.
2638473	2641456	He's none other than... Josh.
2641896	2642416	Failure.
2642737	2644898	Be afraid.
2645299	2646640	Be very afraid.
2649289	2649890	That will be fun.
2651310	2652171	Hide your egos.
2655733	2658775	Alright, so that should be interesting.
2658835	2659976	Sounds like a good group of judges.
2660036	2664198	Now, are you going to be announcing America or is that a wait until the next week?
2665077	2667337	Um, so we don't give away everything.
2667377	2668898	We're not going to have America announced.
2669298	2669818	Oh, okay.
2670578	2671118	Sounds fair enough.
2671698	2676379	And also, um, just to let you know, Ryan Seacrest, uh, we're going to have two co-hosts.
2677259	2678559	So you got Dunkleman back.
2679560	2680900	Yeah.
2681580	2683680	We're going to have two co-hosts, so it's going to be fun.
2684120	2684700	Definitely fun.
2685781	2686121	Alright.
2686841	2688901	You going to talk about who that is, or is that a surprise to you?
2690381	2692602	I think it's better if you find out next week.
2692642	2693482	Many surprises.
2695054	2696015	Yeah, you have to come to figure it out.
2696055	2703420	Or if you're too far away, like if you're on the East Coast and something can't make it out here, you have to tune in live because we'll be broadcasting it live and you'll find all that out because we'll tell you.
2704200	2707223	I think all those people on the East Coast should just, you know, bite the bullet and get a plane ticket.
2708083	2713727	Ride the Amtrak, use a Greyhound, hitchhike, sell yourself to be at this tournament.
2715308	2719331	And don't worry, Sacramento doesn't really have any large skyscrapers, so you're still good.
2721112	2721913	Folsom has a dam.
2723959	2725160	What about nuclear power plants?
2726281	2728002	They shut down Rancho Sego years ago, right?
2729804	2731485	What about all the Air Force bases we have here?
2731765	2731945	Shh!
2734327	2736389	They all keep getting bought out and privatized.
2739051	2739271	Yeah.
2740072	2743695	Alright, so, any other things about March Madness we gotta talk about?
2744035	2745256	Oh my god, oh my god, we should bomb RBGL.
2745296	2745776	Oh my god.
2747335	2748756	Yeah, that's the only thing you have to worry about.
2749076	2749857	I second that notion.
2750197	2759724	But I will have to say, this is one of the tournaments that you actually want to participate in because last year was so much fun.
2761405	2767809	I mean, going through the 64 people and 32 matches, who really gives a shit about the 7-10 matchup, right?
2769250	2771952	So it ended up being one of the most exciting matches in the first round.
2771992	2775194	Hyperbroken versus Liquid Blue.
2775914	2783799	It's just a little blast from the past, but what happened was Hyperbroken was the number 10 seed, Liquid Blue was the 7th seed.
2785000	2788782	And Liquid Blue was lucky enough to get his song, La Señorita.
2789782	2794285	But Hyperbroken won by one great, and everyone in the building was chanting Upset.
2795126	2795466	Upset.
2798058	2801559	and who couldn't forget Chubbs taking out the number one, Enoan.
2802540	2805461	You know, I think this year there's going to be much more upsets.
2807061	2810762	The way it's structured, one win all the way throughout, so nothing is guaranteed.
2810842	2813003	You can get your song and run the table.
2814063	2816944	Anyways, you want to say anything, DarkShark?
2818425	2818765	Nah.
2819545	2821746	I'm wondering if we're going to have our great white ninja.
2823601	2824061	I don't know.
2824842	2826684	The Great White Ninja's in Wisconsin right now.
2826984	2829686	It's kind of hard to get a ninja, you know, magically appear here.
2830106	2840755	Well, I have been asked to let it be known to the Asian innovation that the Caucasian innovation, 23rd Magus, will do a max unlimited routine with DDR Idol.
2844438	2847261	Be prepared to have your statements on videotape.
2849262	2849883	Let it be known.
2852572	2862916	Alright, by the way, we will be producing a DVD eventually with this tournament, so if you guys miss it, you will be able to relive all the moments again with commentary.
2865797	2867338	I'm on DVD, sweet.
2868878	2870579	Trust me, this will be just like Jackass.
2872080	2875281	Hey, could my double trick paranoia routine be a special feature?
2877216	2878197	Yeah, baby, yeah.
2879437	2879718	Oh, yeah.
2880058	2881038	This is how Dick Vitale does it.
2881239	2882319	Yeah, baby, yeah!
2882399	2883320	Maybe we should get the bats.
2886001	2889023	Yeah, maybe Jamie and I will do a reprise of our middle two routine.
2889504	2889964	That'll be fun.
2890684	2892946	I'm actually half-tempted to auction off my orange pad on Sunday.
2894127	2894947	Nice, nice.
2895567	2897048	Auction the bat for charity or something.
2898609	2899630	All five cents it's worth.
2900598	2901018	Fried Twinkies
2919381	2925084	One very cool thing that's going to be run on the side of March Madness is a 2DX tournament.
2926265	2930908	I believe, am I not correct, this is NorCal's first big 2DX tournament, correct?
2931568	2932309	I think so, yeah.
2932329	2932749	I think so.
2934050	2937952	So the very first 2DX tournament will be this weekend.
2938332	2938932	And guess what?
2939252	2943035	We're going to announce the qualifying songs here live, but we'll do that after the FUs.
2943775	2944355	You want to do it right now?
2945256	2945636	Right now?
2946396	2947296	Alright, let's talk about it.
2947976	2956119	Now, what's funny about this, only like four people in the whole world know about the 2DX qualifiers right now.
2956419	2957219	Mike doesn't even know.
2958560	2962961	It's his dang tournament, the March Madness, but he doesn't know.
2963001	2964662	But you're going to be competing in 2DX, right?
2964922	2965442	Yes, I will.
2965702	2968743	Alright, so it would be good to get some reactions from some contestants here live on air.
2968783	2971324	So let's talk about what those qualifiers are going to be.
2974918	2975660	Alright, here we go.
2975680	2977664	I've got to bring them up, so fill time.
2978386	2980110	Tell us more about how the 2DX tournament will work, Jamie.
2982135	2988340	You hit the keys, turn the slidey thing, and you make a song.
2988900	2989921	That's how 2DX works.
2990421	2994824	Really, the way it's going to work is qualifiers are going to have two songs that they have to play.
2994905	2996686	Higher score moves on, basically.
2997907	2999208	And the rest of it's going to go like that.
2999248	3005372	However, for anyone who went to Shaft, the rest of the tournament is going to work very much like Shaft worked, where we have the categories with the songs.
3005893	3007114	And the categories, by the way...
3008357	3010378	In our minds, they're associated with the songs.
3010418	3012418	They may not necessarily be that way in your mind.
3013499	3015999	And it's going to be challenging.
3016239	3016860	We can put it that way.
3016920	3017620	It's going to be challenging.
3018460	3025562	But it'll be a fun tournament, and I don't think anyone's going to walk away from that being really unsatisfied.
3026702	3028683	Unless you start with the qualifiers with V and other.
3029783	3031364	We're not going to go that hard.
3031924	3032024	No.
3034429	3035929	It might get harder though in the later rounds.
3035949	3037690	Definitely would get harder in the later rounds.
3038410	3043671	But we're not going to say anything about that.
3044332	3046132	What about squeezing crotch?
3046752	3047653	Dude, this ferret.
3047713	3048793	These noises he's making.
3049113	3051574	You have to squeeze his crotch to make these noises.
3052354	3055015	I'd be making noises if someone squeezed my crotch.
3058196	3059916	Last week on Orange Lounge.
3060637	3061757	We don't do those anymore, you know?
3062941	3064981	I got lazy, so I stopped doing those flashback clicks.
3065241	3067342	And yes, we will be announcing qualifiers here in just a second.
3067362	3068342	I'm just killing some stuff up.
3069902	3071503	I'll do them when we get in our new place.
3072363	3073063	I'll make them evil.
3073603	3074763	And we're sponsored by Pringles.
3074803	3075183	God.
3075983	3080464	I'm sponsored by Propel and the letter Z. Yeah.
3080784	3082084	I thought that was what they said about sex.
3082164	3085685	No, once you pop it.
3086425	3087305	Yeah, you don't stop it.
3088806	3090406	Oh, too bad these Pringles taste like shit.
3092251	3095232	Actually, sex tastes like shit too, depending on what kind you do.
3096432	3098072	Dude, I don't know who you're having sex with.
3098132	3099172	It shouldn't taste like that.
3100833	3108794	Well, it depends on how you... Wrong end.
3109574	3112635	That was a cartoon too.
3115155	3117756	We have an unpaid sponsor now, www.rotten.com
3120849	3129737	www.styleproject.com That's S-T-I-L-E styleproject.com Alright, you guys ready to hear those qualifiers for 2DX?
3129977	3130217	Yeah.
3130478	3130758	Alright.
3131439	3134922	Okay, as you know, or may not know, the 2DX qualifiers are in pairs.
3135282	3138965	So you have to play two songs, and you can't pick two songs on the list.
3139025	3141087	Each song has a partner song that must be played with it.
3141487	3141948	So here it is.
3142488	3145191	The first pair of qualifiers is Deadline.
3145311	3146131	Fucking shit!
3146472	3146552	Oh.
3149144	3153055	Followed by, oh I should say Deadline 7 Key, followed by the Safari, Light 7
3154660	3162826	All right, it's the first pair, Deadline and Safari Light 7.
3162866	3167550	The second pair that you can pick from is Airflow, 7Key.
3167570	3169232	That song sucks.
3172795	3173916	Sorry, I pulled these really quickly.
3174196	3177939	And the partner song to that is Kochiwo Muteo from 6Style.
3181508	3183349	Okay, I know I'm not going to be picking that pair.
3185889	3186669	Just shoot me.
3188690	3190310	Third pair that you can pick from.
3190891	3191751	This is the third pair.
3191811	3192731	It's Cheer Train.
3193391	3194672	What the hell is Cheer Train?
3198753	3199593	Okay.
3202054	3203394	And that's partnered with Abyss.
3212731	3239720	And the third pair is Indigo Vision And that's partnered with Spooky And the last pair is Alien World Well, that's an easy one, but it's partnered with Rizlem
3245462	3246323	All these suck.
3246824	3249988	So... So there they are.
3250609	3252672	Those are the qualifying songs for the 2DX tournament.
3252692	3253993	What the fuck is Cheer Train?
3255075	3256216	You want to hear Cheer Train one more time?
3256297	3258039	Wasn't that a side quest of Final Fantasy VIII?
3258239	3259120	No, it's from VII Style.
3263195	3266757	We'll play some of those during the breaks, so you can get refreshed with those songs.
3267217	3269178	Yes, songs were kind of picked on purpose.
3269538	3271739	Half songs people play and half people don't play.
3272360	3274100	Let me run down those one more time.
3274581	3278202	These are the pairs you can pick from to qualify with for the 2DX Tournament of March Madness.
3278242	3281324	First pair, Deadline, 7Key, and Safari, Light 7.
3282304	3285946	Second pair is Airflow, and pronounce that for me because I'm too white.
3287367	3287487	Where?
3287507	3287687	Where?
3292822	3295825	and the third set is Cheer Train and Abyss.
3296465	3297346	It's both seven key.
3297366	3302230	The fourth pair is Indigo Vision and Spooky, both seven key.
3302731	3303311	Four key!
3303531	3304993	Oh, I love this tournament already!
3306274	3310117	And the fifth pair is Alien World and Rizlem, seven key.
3310657	3311118	So there you go.
3311818	3315662	Now you can start practicing and picking which pair you think is the best one.
3315962	3317103	These choices suck.
3318064	3318985	Literally, they suck.
3319645	3320466	These songs suck.
3322608	3323409	I already know what I'm doing.
3323449	3325231	We're going by expert score, so I already know what I'm doing.
3326272	3326552	Alright.
3328354	3329655	I think I'm not entering this song.
3329675	3330937	I can pass half of those songs.
3331457	3332979	And the other half I can't.
3332999	3333940	Which one's the one with your train?
3334861	3335261	Abyss.
3335862	3337984	Okay, I failed Abyss with like a vengeance today.
3338004	3338785	I got a 12 on it.
3342269	3342969	Okay, so...
3344207	3344727	Hooray for that.
3346888	3353872	As promised during this segment, we would get to the FUs of the week, so if we're done talking about March Madness now... You guys done?
3354672	3356013	Is there anything else we need to say about March Madness?
3358774	3369880	Okay, well let's do... Let's do the FUs of the week, and you know, since Asian Innovation and Dark Child have never been here for the FUs of the week, Jamie, you wanted to explain to them how it works.
3370540	3371981	Busy opening my Propel, fuck you.
3372641	3373182	Um, oh wait.
3373722	3373762	Um...
3374768	3375649	That is exactly it.
3376369	3379171	Fuck yous of the week are where you talk about shit you're pissed off about.
3380471	3380871	That's it.
3382052	3385574	Anything that you want to give a fuck you to, just tell them right now on the air.
3385614	3386875	They may not be listening, but oh well.
3386895	3387955	It feels better to get it out.
3389016	3392258	I fucking hate the fucking gas prices fucking going on fucking right now.
3392338	3393198	You gotta wait your turn.
3393899	3394619	You gotta wait your turn.
3394739	3395119	Fuck!
3397801	3401583	So, with that being said, let's get started, shall we, Jamie?
3408922	3410123	This is fucked up!
3411164	3413186	My first fuck you of the week goes for being unemployed.
3414287	3425217	But also being unemployed is a good thing because my life is much more enjoyable since I can go wake up at 2 in the afternoon and go to Scandia, play 2DX for three hours and then go back home and sleep.
3426238	3430502	Um, fuck you to my car still not being tuned up, although they're doing everything they can.
3430623	3432024	I'm being patient about it.
3433485	3433986	But, um...
3435334	3436615	It's just been a while, okay?
3436655	3438295	It's just been a while.
3438876	3440877	Also goes for people who can't drive.
3441517	3446459	And goes toward the particular exit from the Boston Market parking lot.
3447139	3448940	And for the woman who looked like a troll.
3449280	3449761	You remember her?
3451481	3456223	The woman in the white car who I seriously thought... You've seen that movie Troll, right?
3457364	3459125	She looked like Troll.
3459285	3460665	Except she was not great.
3461306	3461366	Um...
3462569	3463630	She was going to live under a bridge.
3463650	3465372	Yeah, she was driving to a bridge.
3467414	3476542	And then my other fuck you goes toward not being able to think of anything else to say fuck you to.
3477002	3479444	I wasn't going to say it.
3480505	3481026	Hire me.
3481747	3482087	Thank you.
3490171	3492352	There's a big, huge, like, knot in the cord here.
3492432	3494932	I mean, we're talking, like, massive knot here.
3497533	3499373	That's a big, huge knot.
3500093	3502214	FU to Rob for keeping his cords all knotted.
3502254	3505034	Of course, I can't really say much about that because you should see it on my computer.
3505054	3507055	It's like a giant, massive cord.
3508095	3509776	Anyways, um, let's see.
3509996	3510776	I know I had... Oh, yeah!
3512905	3517689	F you to McDonald's for putting their freaking condiments and everything under the cheese.
3518150	3525756	I don't like pickles on my fucking cheeseburgers if I ever ask for them to take them off because that takes extra time and they're slow as it is.
3526257	3534104	So this dumb bitch puts the fucking pickles underneath the cheese where you cannot get at the pickles because they're under the cheese and melted over, you know.
3534704	3537347	So it pissed me off because I was biting into the hamburger.
3537387	3539849	First I looked at it and go, oh look, no pickles on this.
3540189	3541210	and they didn't put any condiments.
3541250	3544211	I bite into it, taste pickle, and then get pissed.
3544231	3547512	So, you're so stupid, you can't even... You fucked up a burger!
3547872	3548813	How easy is that?
3549493	3550333	Fucking a burger?
3551094	3551954	Put this shit together.
3553054	3554315	You're fucking a burger?
3555355	3556356	They're fucking a burger.
3556776	3557917	They're fucking up a burger.
3558697	3559557	Well, that explains a lot.
3559577	3560478	What the hell?
3560978	3564519	You weren't complaining, I fixed it.
3564619	3567300	Okay, anyways.
3567841	3567941	Um...
3573473	3574033	I don't know that much.
3574053	3575554	Fuck you to microphones that aren't low.
3575574	3582177	F you to my stupid, your remix, DarkSakura, that's not coming along because it's just, I don't know, not good.
3583297	3587299	F you to me for having a headache and I don't know where it's coming from.
3588460	3590481	I don't know.
3591621	3600426	Damn, you know, it sucks because I was really angsty earlier this morning, but then after hearing that Miyazaki screwed way one, I just kind of forgot about everything.
3600446	3601106	It's okay.
3601846	3607730	I don't give a fuck about watching an explosion that happened six hours ago, numerous times,
3618517	3619278	all day long.
3619658	3620659	Look, it's bombing.
3620799	3621960	Look, there's bombing going on.
3622161	3622741	No shit.
3622801	3623922	What do you think they're doing over there?
3623962	3624803	Having a rave?
3624883	3625604	Having a party?
3625924	3626765	Is everyone getting along?
3626885	3629847	I don't care about your fucking bombing and seeing the little explosions.
3630108	3632270	If I wanted to see explosions, I'd watch fireworks.
3632930	3633210	You know...
3634091	3637596	It's stupid, and I don't give a crap about half the stuff they have on there.
3637816	3643503	Yahoo News now, there's like, the print is so small because there's so many stupid, you know, headlines on there.
3643984	3644965	I can't read any of it.
3645005	3651294	It's like, uh, soldiers something, something.
3652755	3653236	It's annoying.
3653436	3657058	I just really wish... If I wanted to watch 24-hour news, I'd tune into CNN.
3657138	3664763	I don't want CNN on another station because I'm trying to watch, you know, some other show like American Idol or something like that.
3666524	3668865	My girlfriend watches American Idol, I just watch it with her.
3670226	3670506	I'm done.
3679177	3680678	Uh, my FUs of the week.
3680698	3682238	You know, I haven't even really thought about these.
3682618	3686980	Um, FU to having nothing to really rant about.
3687520	3688720	FU to still being single.
3689281	3690881	FU to six months without sex.
3690961	3691621	That sucks.
3694802	3695703	FU to being tired.
3695783	3700624	I got tired way too easy the other, uh, I got tired way too easy that last night.
3700784	3701805	I'm feeling old.
3701885	3702545	I wasn't even drunk.
3702605	3703465	There's no excuse for that.
3704246	3705566	And, uh, FU to Anita.
3705706	3706586	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
3707047	3708127	Just like I did at Faces, baby.
3709102	3712945	Okay, I'm older than you, and if you feel older than me, then you suck.
3714205	3714566	F that.
3716107	3717708	Alright, moving on, let's go around the room.
3718108	3718888	Uh, who wants to start?
3720970	3721470	Start with Zero?
3724492	3725433	My baby's mama.
3725613	3728355	I'm not even gonna say anything.
3729035	3734739	But about, like, watching fireworks, bombs are really, really big fireworks that blow up people's houses and buildings.
3736249	3744716	Yeah, but I didn't see any bodies flying in the air, nothing happening, they're all... Like earlier today, they just had a picture of the night sky, they're all... They're all now... Hold on, hold on, hold on.
3744736	3745096	Hear that?
3745276	3745857	In the distance?
3746077	3748899	There's bombing going on... FALL AWAY WHERE WE CAN'T SEE IT!
3749119	3750941	BUT WE'RE STILL SHOWING THE GODDAMN CITY!
3751581	3752202	WHO CARES?
3752302	3753002	TURN IT OFF!
3754083	3754924	DO SOME OTHER NEWS!
3754964	3758386	I'M SURE THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENING IN THE WORLD OTHER THAN THIS STUPID BOMBING!
3758627	3759787	NO, EVERYTHING'S STOPPED!
3760868	3761529	Just for the bombing.
3764227	3769930	No, but I gotta, like, the only thing I really like about watching those is when they make you listen to all the gunfire and all the stuff.
3769950	3775434	You know somebody's dying somewhere, or someone just got blown up, and that's the coolest part about the reward.
3775714	3781437	Fox News showed the caravan, and then they showed camels and goats following the tanks.
3781597	3786920	Yeah, after some stupid fucking guy says, yeah, we see camels out here, and they're very distressed.
3787461	3787981	It's like, whatever.
3788021	3789242	But anyways, back to my FUs.
3790016	3793143	One, I have an F you to, well, kind of war related.
3793384	3796010	There's a stupid guy in the UK and I know he's listening.
3797313	3798476	Stop sending me fucking...
3799742	3807967	Yeah, or IMs over MSN Messenger telling me to go on busy for 15 minutes to, to like, grieve the 15 UK soldiers who died.
3808567	3813330	I'm not gonna go on 15, on a 15 minute busy every damn 15 fucking minutes.
3814270	3821514	You know, you might be an absolute sort of stupid loser, and who the hell cares, get a life, and get off the internet and go do something.
3822355	3822435	Um...
3825745	3827385	Oh my god, say that again.
3828006	3832107	Well, because Dreamcatcher told me that British people are aliens anyways.
3832947	3833947	Giant worm aliens.
3834247	3835167	They're shit weasels.
3835727	3837108	They fly out of your ass.
3837708	3838648	Like Sam Cassell.
3839148	3840689	Yeah.
3841249	3842489	My other FU is to my computer.
3842509	3848290	I just got a new webcam, and it'll install it, and then give me a fucking warning every damn time I try to open the stupid program.
3849071	3850311	Give me your webcam, you can have mine.
3852397	3854924	If it works, I mean, mine's just stupid.
3854964	3855225	Yeah.
3857137	3858958	Okay, well, I might have to reinstall the thing.
3859078	3871265	But anyways, um, another FU is to, like, the friggin', whatchacallit, like, not having money sucks, but I got money yesterday, though, so I'm okay with that.
3871585	3884373	Um, an FU is to the stupid bastard who decided it'd be a good idea to take off the damn yard sale signs at my mom's yard sale, so I had to go and fucking put up all ten of them again, and if I ever see you again, because I know who you are, I swear to God I will kill you.
3885873	3892965	Another F you is to these stupid shrimp chips because they're too addicting and they make me sick.
3893226	3893446	What?
3894848	3895750	Sponsored by Kelby.
3898158	3900340	Um, that's all I really got right now.
3900500	3908406	Oh yeah, stupid, um, fuck you to the stupid road to perdition, getting the best cinematography, uh, just winning for cinematography.
3908786	3916031	It should have gone to, um, uh, what is it, Gangs of New York, because they actually did really well, and that's all I gotta say, so I'm done.
3916112	3918253	One last thing, you are cool.
3919614	3925398	Alright, first off, um, I wanna give some fuck you's out to everyone that is listening.
3926459	3926840	Thank you.
3927708	3928429	Very, very much.
3929289	3934833	Alright, the next fuck you goes out to the Tomahawk Missiles, the Cruise Missiles, and the Patriot Missiles.
3935733	3938435	Each missile costs us about 1 and 2 million each.
3938755	3941457	We're launching billions of missiles on the air atmosphere.
3941937	3950402	You know, all that money that we've been spending on these fucking missiles could be going to the Somalians so we can be feeding the Somalians, giving them food, and building future terrorists.
3950743	3951043	You know?
3951963	3954245	So I think we're killing two birds with one stone right now, aren't we?
3955200	3980858	Alright, yeah, yeah, my next fuck you goes out to Windows XP, today I was trying to, you guys shouldn't do this, I was trying to install a pirated copy of Windows XP, but I tried to get a Windows update and it wouldn't let me because it was pirated, what the fuck, why would I even, I got a corporate version for you if you want it.
3982699	3985621	Alright, uh, fuck you to professional Windows XP.
3986582	3987843	Amen to the corporate versions.
3996709	4002814	Alright, fuck, okay, my next fuck you goes out to all these people on the freeways that speed, that don't know how to drive.
4003314	4006256	Cause on my way to Sacramento today, I was stuck in traffic.
4006877	4008358	No, not because traffic was slow.
4009440	4012102	But some idiots decided to get into a car accident.
4012322	4016965	Yes, they did decide to get into it because they were driving probably 150 miles an hour in a 70 zone.
4017445	4020607	But it's alright because they're on stretchers now and they're feeling the pain.
4021468	4022048	Hint, hint.
4022348	4023049	Don't be stupid.
4024830	4026971	Let me see, where does my next fuck you go to?
4027872	4028772	I had it a second ago.
4028872	4029573	Oh, come back to me.
4030453	4031654	I'll pass it on until I get it back.
4032775	4034376	I'm going to use this mic because it's a bit better.
4035325	4036526	I got a lot of fuck you's.
4037406	4047430	First off, fuck you to all your stupid, high horse, prissy little DDR players that make fun of all those people who are just beginning or you think are just beginning.
4047850	4049171	I know who you motherfuckers are.
4049551	4051512	You guys were laughing at me when I was playing.
4051592	4053413	You have no idea who the hell I am.
4053713	4054933	I'm coming after you fools.
4055974	4057074	Next big fuck you.
4057594	4059095	I'm going to get a lot of shit for this one.
4060315	4062156	Fuck you, President Bush.
4062676	4064817	Fuck you and this goddamn war.
4065117	4070900	Spending $400 billion on this goddamn war.
4070920	4073821	$161 billion would solve all the problems with our education system.
4074301	4075342	Fuck you, Bush.
4076762	4077663	Or free the Somalians.
4079063	4081024	Another big fuck you involved in the war.
4081624	4085826	Fuck you, American media and all your goddamn lies.
4086787	4087547	Hey, we're the media.
4088612	4089112	We're indie.
4089813	4090694	Not American press.
4091774	4092575	Indie press is cool.
4092615	4093335	Indie press is cool.
4093355	4094356	I ain't got nothing against them.
4095217	4097198	Let's see, what other big fuck yous?
4098379	4102642	Yeah, media needs to just stop telling us that they know shit, but then say, oh, but we don't know that for sure.
4105845	4111529	Whatever happened to that shuttle crash that, I don't know, took place a while back and then all of a sudden, oh, hey, war!
4112870	4115337	Whatever happened to, uh, what was that guy's name again?
4115538	4117724	Um, what was it?
4118205	4119449	Osama bin Laden.
4119649	4120271	Where's he?
4121218	4123699	But anyways, another big fuck you.
4123839	4124579	Gas prices.
4124699	4127419	What about stories about how ugly Rosie O'Donnell is?
4127480	4128700	Why don't I see those anymore?
4129460	4131080	Because the lesbians gave up on that one.
4131180	4134241	And did Michael Jackson just stop molesting kids all of a sudden, you know?
4134801	4135021	Huh?
4135361	4139362	And we've tried so hard to get Rosie O'Donnell out of our minds, so yeah.
4139882	4141123	You know what's funny about this whole thing?
4141283	4142663	They're never going to catch Saddam.
4142883	4144363	He's just going to slip through again.
4144384	4146584	And we're going to have this all in like another ten years.
4147064	4147844	All over again.
4148584	4150385	I think that he exists in a virtual reality.
4151781	4155862	Osama Bin Laden's hand is up Saddam's ass, that's where he is.
4156422	4158623	Saddam's been dead for 20 years, haven't you guys known that?
4158683	4159763	He's been using one of his doubles.
4162104	4162904	But he has a live journal.
4163645	4172867	So there's one post, because there's one computer that's actually connected to the internet.
4173068	4173828	Good job!
4177856	4179558	Okay, another fuck you.
4180218	4181279	I don't remember your name.
4181299	4183141	I don't remember what you look like.
4183662	4186564	It was at Asian Innovation's birthday party.
4186965	4189627	You showed up uninvited, but with Hyperbroken.
4190268	4191549	No beef against Hyperbroken.
4191589	4193010	Hyperbroken, you're cool, alright?
4193511	4199176	But this motherfucker, tall ass, lanky white dude, he's about 6'3", you might know who he is.
4199417	4200297	Oh shit, it's Brad.
4202294	4203775	I only know his call name, I'm sorry.
4204155	4208777	But this motherfucker, alright, I send money out with Hyperbroken to pick up some drinks.
4209138	4214660	That does not mean this motherfucker can then go and spend some of my goddamn money on his own personal drink.
4215061	4217142	That's what tall, lanky-ass white boy did.
4217662	4219163	If you know who he is, let me know.
4219203	4220083	I want to find his ass.
4220103	4221364	He still owes me two bucks.
4223354	4224174	Motherfuck you.
4225455	4232317	Fuck you to the people who are unemployed and can go to bed and stay asleep till 2 in the goddamn afternoon.
4233038	4235258	I envy all you guys, so fuck you.
4235799	4237139	But I want to have a job.
4237659	4238419	Because I need money.
4239600	4240560	I'm not getting unemployment.
4241320	4242061	Oh, that sucks.
4242081	4246362	I could, but I'm not because my man makes enough to support us both, which is enough.
4247403	4249323	But... Hey!
4249864	4250784	Tell someone to hire me!
4252720	4253241	All right.
4254381	4257024	Chat room is demanding we get to their FUs, so here we go.
4257044	4258084	Fuck you!
4258184	4259485	Here we go.
4259525	4262468	Fuck the chat room FUs for breaking up my fuck you.
4262488	4263388	What were you doing?
4263428	4264449	Did you have anything else you wanted to add?
4265910	4269053	Fuck you, the crazy-ass women giving us double signals.
4269753	4271855	One minute they hot, one minute they cold.
4271875	4273877	You don't know what the fuck is going on.
4275117	4276358	That just means they're in menopause.

4360110	4360831	I think that's it.

4362253	4362513	Male.
4362934	4363575	Oh, nevermind.
4364916	4368060	Arcadian42 says, fuck you to my body for being in bad shape this week.
4368100	4371844	I started out with a sore throat that developed into a cold, then went away, then came back.
4372305	4372525	Also...
4373286	4377508	My left foot hurt at the beginning of the week and then stopped hurting and now my right foot hurts.
4377908	4381170	It also kept me from getting anything accomplished this week since I didn't want to go out at all.
4381530	4385511	Fuck you to tailgaters who can't see that you can't move up any farther in traffic.
4385551	4386132	Fucking idiots.
4389033	4390434	That reminds me of a fuck you.
4390794	4392354	Fuck you goddamn pneumonia.

4398497	4400258	Fuck you to bad Chinese immigration.
4402180	4405842	F you to, or I'm sorry, Subdisciplinary says he's angsty this week.
4405862	4411825	So a big fat fuck you goes out to all the people at Fry's for not having metal pads when I really wanted them and had the money to buy them.
4411885	4413046	I call, they say they have them.
4413346	4415247	I get there and they're like, oh, you mean the metal ones?
4415287	4416268	We don't have those anymore.
4416648	4419890	So fuck them for being fucking retarded cousin-humping cock gobblers.
4420530	4422933	Also, fuck you to my current pads for sucking so much.
4423634	4427758	I can't pass any onis on these fucking steaming piles of monkey doo that have arrows scrawled in them.

4436487	4437768	That's almost as cool as ass meat.
4437788	4439530	No, you missed this.
4439690	4440872	Fuck those poo pads.
4443320	4448001	Also, fuck my new shoes for not being dusty and frippy and shit.
4448121	4451242	I get like 47 greats on Matsuri Japan yesterday and that's too many.
4451282	4454883	I miss my old DCs because they weren't flaming pieces of lemur shit.
4455403	4458223	I can PA about as well as a mouse sphincter now.
4459924	4460664	Wow, that's all.
4460824	4465405	Oh wait, fuck you to not being able to go to the Bomani party last night because I wanted to show off my edits in Step Mania Files.
4467774	4473517	It's okay, I'm going to have more, so you have to promise to at least come to one of my upcoming ones.
4473718	4477620	Ness151 says, can I F you DDR Coralville again for DDR extremage?
4478240	4478821	Okay, sure.
4480502	4484184	SkylineDC505 says, F you to Starbucks for being so damn expensive.

4492632	4495975	Fuck the mall for throwing you out for just carrying a skateboard.
4496576	4499859	Fuck my dad for bitching about me doing stuff that I didn't do, plain and simple.
4500380	4501701	No, screw my dad one, oops.
4502542	4502842	Oops!
4503703	4506986	Fuck the poppin' music non-stop for making me get one good three times in a row.
4508327	4512010	That guy was so stupid, he was in the middle of Madison on a bike.
4533974	4535217	In the middle, crossing traffic.
4535618	4536259	For no reason.
4536279	4537261	What a moron.
4537421	4539245	And that, and he looked like a troll too.
4539706	4541409	You should have gotten another kid's nil.
4541510	4542692	Maybe you would have felt better.
4546375	4549618	Rice, RYC3, says F you to AOL and I'll leave it at that.
4550118	4552340	F you to dumb people, F you to stupid kids at CGL.
4553580	4554461	Alright, I have a fucky.
4554481	4555742	Fucky for all these kids.
4556202	4561947	There are, like, probably 12 to 15 that are thinking that AOL is the only way you can connect to the internet.
4562887	4567951	Big fuck you to all you kids who post comments saying fuck you to other kids when you're a kid yourself.
4569338	4573779	F you to frickin' AOL for ruining the whole theme to the Six Million Dollar Man.
4575140	4575660	You suck.
4575740	4579101	Their new commercial is the Six Million Dollar Man theme, and they fucked it up.
4579501	4583542	See, I don't watch TV, so I don't know these things.
4584022	4587983	I still have AOL, but that's just because I don't want to get rid of my DarkSakura and Killmilder.
4591020	4602161	I have a sentimental attachment, I've had that name for like 9 years now Another fuck you to AOL for being so complicated now, you can't sign on without a fucking GPS system
4604763	4607966	EOSFVB says, fuck you to war, if you can even call it that.
4608087	4610709	It's more like an assault, seeing as how Iraq can't do shit.
4610949	4614193	They've got like three anti-aircraft water balloons and a Nerf gun.
4614493	4614993	Who cares?
4615474	4616815	Saddam gasses his own people.
4617576	4619518	Those people suck dick, so fuck them too.
4619938	4622400	Yeah, yeah, fuck that shit.
4622440	4626044	One thing about that, BBC.com has actually a really good breakdown of...
4627915	4633425	What the average quality of life is as far as what people make, how much things cost.
4633826	4635810	They wear pink scarves, goddammit!
4637034	4641198	I just kind of, I mean, I understand what they think the reasons are.
4641238	4643740	My brother's actually in the Marines over in Kuwait right now.
4644741	4647684	Are you going to trust the media that's ran by Tony Blair?
4648605	4652869	Well, apart from that, though, I mean, you can go look anywhere and find the same stats.
4653650	4660516	But I find it very funny that the average doctor makes $45 a month, whereas how much does the average doctor make a year per month?
4661710	4664552	They maybe make $45 a half hour?
4672678	4674319	You know, Iraq doesn't really exist.
4674399	4680904	It's just a giant pool for all the money that Bush is spending right now to go to the Area 51 and Alien Projects things.
4681384	4682825	Really, this whole war does not exist.
4682885	4684266	It's a big, giant cover-up.
4685147	4686168	You heard it here first!
4689778	4691960	Yeah, I think he's trying to compensate for something.
4693701	4696343	It's actually all taking place in the studio in New Mexico.
4696363	4700907	Alright, I want to give a fuck you out to France, Montreal, and Quebec.
4701667	4708152	First of all, yeah, it's not French fries anymore, it's American fries, and call everything Freedom Fries on American toast.
4708272	4709213	They're from Belgium.
4710034	4712055	Okay, about France real quick.
4712916	4717760	How can we say fuck you, because they were going to just go against one of our security resolutions that we proposed.
4718180	4719160	I mean, come on, the U.S.
4719240	4722642	has vetoed over 24 U.S.
4722702	4727183	resolutions that were going to reprimand Israel for what they've done to the Palestinians.
4727343	4729224	And we get pissed off because of one veto.
4729944	4732245	How about Calvin's Quet de Mer?
4733926	4734506	Out of shit.
4734726	4739888	Speaking of head of state, that's going to be a good movie.
4744891	4749315	I'm looking at a picture that Jazz posted in the chatroom.
4749515	4751777	It's all greats on Happy Wedding, and thank you.
4761047	4762428	And that'll get you a C, yeah.
4762628	4763008	Interesting.
4763368	4764649	Alright, anyway, let's finish up the FUs.
4765049	4766830	I'm not done yet.
4767010	4771312	Manikinigo Jazz says, FU to having no money because now I can't go to March Madness.
4771892	4772713	Cry, sniff.
4772873	4773753	You need to get up here somehow.
4774954	4776575	And I'm going to jump the bandwagon.
4776775	4777495	FU to being single.
4783792	4786256	I'm white, what do you expect, babe?
4787238	4793407	That's it, oh, I have to check the mailbag, but as far as I know, that's it, so Does DDRholic have something?
4796212	4801116	Once again, continuing FU to the DDR Extreme Roulette System.
4801516	4802176	God damn it!
4802817	4803497	Fucking A!
4803677	4806840	Every fucking time I do Roulette, I get one away from Legend of Max!
4807140	4809521	And you taunt me with your goddamn shifting!
4809902	4811623	It goes to Legend of Max, and it's like, Ha!
4812003	4812724	You can't have that!
4812784	4815205	You can have 2D Chaser Morning Mix instead!
4815546	4816126	Asshole!
4816927	4818748	So, FU to the freaking Roulette System.
4819033	4822577	All right, I could go on and on with fuck yous for the whole entire night.
4823157	4835409	If anyone wants to hear the rest of my fuck yous, you can catch me on AIM under darkchild999, that's C-H-Y-L-D-E-9-9-9, or on Yahoo on dchild999, or on ICQ at 110960221.
4835449	4835529	Yeah.
4841027	4851902	or you can email me at darkchild999 at hotmail, dchild999 at yahoo, jwilson at wowdy.net, wilsonjason at acmsystems.com, and I could go on and on, but that's enough.
4851922	4855687	I wonder if I should make a Bomani player singles page on my website.
4859383	4860083	That would be funny.
4860443	4860724	Alright.
4861304	4865506	I want to give a fuck you out to Singular Wireless for only having reception when your phone is off.
4866206	4872508	I don't know why what you said just gave me flashbacks to that thing posted on DDR Freak that J-Dog posted.
4873069	4875030	The hi, please date me thing.
4877771	4878851	Fuck you, J-Dog.
4879191	4882933	Fuck you, Jason Coe.
4883153	4885674	Can I elaborate on that as long as we're going to be controversial here?
4886943	4898378	fuck you for being a whiny little bitch because some people made fun of your little slide, slide, slide AM3P routine made fun of it, had a good time and you had a little hissy fit about it oh poor baby
4900106	4910937	Address those cards and letters to D. Okay, so I think we're finally done.
4910977	4913579	Is everybody feeling a little less angsty now that we were able to get that off?
4913599	4914460	I always feel angsty.
4914500	4915181	I'm female.
4916902	4918484	You didn't have any FUs, did you, Holly?
4918504	4919505	Do you have anything you want to say?
4920446	4921467	She's playing with the ferret.
4922326	4922666	One more.
4922746	4923567	This one's a big one.
4924008	4925130	Fuck you, U.S.
4925250	4928375	Army, for still having me under obligation until August 23rd.
4928776	4930098	I pray this war doesn't go bad.
4933703	4933964	All right.
4936667	4939768	We can put you on a boat in the cargo hold and send you to Taiwan.
4939788	4946609	Alright, we're going to take a quick break and we'll be back.
4946629	4949970	And when we come back from the break... What?

5398866	5402168	So there's all new Bomani CDs, or Bomani-related CDs coming out.
5402188	5403409	I thought we could talk about a few of them.
5403589	5411594	Loki, you might know more about this than I do, but I mean, the chatroom's kind of been talking about this guy on and off tonight, and I thought maybe we'd bring him up.
5411694	5412715	The Kutimu guy?
5412955	5413175	Yeah.
5413715	5415236	Yeah, he's got a CD coming out.

5424598	5429642	You can sync up your VBMS to that Katimo V. And it works!
5430543	5430883	It works.
5432544	5433004	It was cool.
5433625	5437267	The one that you were playing over last night had them doing Butterfly, but you could hear the background music.
5437307	5438208	I think that's how they do it.
5438228	5443992	He just did Felice 100 Seconds and some other one, I forget, with some other song.
5444232	5444873	Rob, you should play that.
5444893	5447595	I tried to find them all.
5447955	5450437	Well... Here, change your encoding to Japanese.
5452028	5452509	Here, I know.
5452869	5455632	Let me find them stuff.
5456132	5462058	Don't step on the shrimp chips.
5462239	5462919	Um, I have it.
5463420	5468405	I think Rob has it, because Rob, we have to play, um... Which one were you looking for?
5469566	5470047	I don't know.
5470067	5471028	You guys took over.
5471788	5472609	I didn't do anything.
5472649	5473170	I'm sitting here.
5477173	5480895	We have dead airspace.
5481015	5482296	Dead airspace.
5483917	5485198	Here, Anita's going to talk.
5485278	5485958	Yeah, sing for us.
5487019	5489380	Okay, so we can't really find the Coutinho stuff right now.
5489701	5490081	We'll look.
5490641	5492242	Maybe we'll look and see if we can get it later.
5493423	5496245	What's new at tonight's farmer's market?
5496265	5496805	An auction.
5498486	5498946	What the hell?
5498986	5500487	When did this turn into karaoke night?
5502588	5504810	You want to serenade us with some DDR karaoke?
5505570	5506831	Sing for us some DDR karaoke.
5507796	5509077	You want some background music?
5509117	5510738	I don't know if I know the words to anything.
5510798	5516262	Oh, aye, aye, aye, I'm your little butterfly.
5516742	5520005	Green, black, and blue, paint like flowers in the sky.
5520645	5521546	Aye, aye, aye.
5523848	5524928	And he just voiced the game.
5528071	5531213	Let's wait for DWI to come out for that.
5537383	5538304	The whole Barry White thing?
5538964	5541105	It's called pneumonia, that's what it's called, not Barry White.
5542265	5544026	Alright, I'll sing the words of one good song.
5544586	5547188	Mommy, play this song, trip machine.
5547408	5548208	Okay, that's the whole song.
5551430	5552570	Asian Innovations turn.
5552730	5556732	I remember we used to have some kind of really good butterfly rethink that we did for it.
5556752	5558533	I don't think he remembers it though.
5565635	5567456	Yeah, I can, I guess.
5568896	5573718	I can't think of anything I want to sing about.
5573738	5581221	I can see the stars, cause I'm in the sky, wherever you are, I'm gonna see you fly.
5582462	5583442	That was perfect.
5584383	5587104	Okay, if you also think Japanese, what?
5588664	5589405	We have ferret mix.
5595922	5600185	They're suggesting in the chat room that we actually have a karaoke contest at Mountain Mike's.
5601947	5603268	March Madness, David!
5603888	5604729	March Madness.
5606670	5608212	Kick that frecky fresh beat.
5610729	5612790	Alright, am I playing this other Kutimu clip here that we wanted to hear?
5612810	5612970	Alright.
5638365	5639165	Thank you for watching!
5664873	5666034	Thank you for watching!
5693195	5694396	Tirole, Tirole, Tirole, Tirole
5726239	5730785	Beautiful.
5731545	5733248	Dude, that shit rocks.
5734189	5735590	That's the first time I heard that.
5736732	5740016	So, now is it true this guy's got a CD coming out, or what's the deal with this?
5740652	5741892	It's not really a CD.
5741952	5746414	He just makes supposed CDs, but they're just a bunch of MP3s that he has.
5747294	5751175	He's doing a non-stop of his songs, and he's doing some new ones.
5751235	5753696	I forget what was on the list of stuff to be done.
5754416	5759277	If you could pull up our forums again, we can check that, because I actually wrote it down on there.
5766701	5768622	But, uh, let's see here.
5769182	5772323	Um, oh shit, I can't remember offhand what he was doing.
5772343	5773403	There's some good ones.
5773463	5776144	I think a lot of stuff from Beat Mania, if I remember correctly.
5776764	5779305	Um, ah shit.
5780346	5781626	Let me see here.
5781826	5781906	Uh...
5789560	5792661	Let's see, he was going to be doing... Oh, here's some of the new tracks he's going to be doing.
5793041	5797923	He's going to be doing another version of TTR.
5797943	5800963	I guess that was... I have no idea.
5801824	5806765	I think that's the Dance Dance Revolution song, the bonus song.
5807605	5814308	Then he's going to be doing Y31, and he's also doing Butterfly as some of the other tracks coming out soon.
5815228	5817649	So, yeah, that's it.
5818749	5818989	Wow.
5820962	5822603	and his new CD, The Power of Mouth.
5823424	5827407	Which also will be a pack of DWIs coming out soon.
5827947	5828167	Maybe.
5829348	5831249	The Power of Mouth sounds like an erotic title.
5831290	5835392	I know, it sounds like pretty... That should have been one of those rejected erotic songs.
5836833	5837914	We talked about it a couple weeks ago.
5840716	5843278	Speaking of CD releases, topic change.
5844499	5847041	Dance Mania is putting out a whole shitload of albums this month.
5848330	5849070	That series still exists?
5849631	5850611	Yeah, believe it or not.
5851051	5855953	Well, there's no... There's actually... No, the last one that came out was Dance Mania EX2.
5855973	5858674	It was the last one that came out in the actual Dance Mania line.
5858694	5864476	But a lot of these sister compilations... Well, let's think.
5864536	5864816	Let's think.
5864876	5865476	Okay, there's been 10.
5866136	5866837	There were 10 of them.
5866917	5872979	No, there were 9 plus another 9, 18, were all the Xs and the ones without the X. And then...
5877185	5883008	Right, okay, so there's 20, okay, right, yeah, there's 20, and then two more, 24, you're right.
5885249	5891692	Okay, so anyone, these are the new ones that are coming out very soon, or are already out in Japan, they're just not over here yet.
5892692	5898134	Okay, there's Base 11 Hyper Best, which is... Huh?
5898355	5901836	I don't think there's any samples for this one, I... Where?
5902076	5902556	Where's sample?
5902937	5904177	No, it wasn't sample.
5904918	5905078	Um...
5906505	5910406	It has my baby mama on it, so you know this is more of like a best.
5910726	5915828	There's Like A Virgin and Billie Jean.
5915908	5916928	Best of Hardcore.
5917428	5919028	Speed presents the Best of Hardcore.
5919048	5920029	Now that has to be mine.
5920929	5931812	It starts off with Triple J, Follow The Sun, and then goes into some other tracks, Let It Be, Time After Time, 99 Red Balloons, Heaven, Here Come The Noise.
5933152	5934693	And then we have Trancemania 3.
5937266	5938507	It has all sorts of interesting stuff.
5938527	5939909	It has a group called the Porn Kings on it.
5940169	5941190	Cool, I like them already.
5941550	5944552	And then, of course, one more time we get Lasco is something.
5945193	5948696	Jeez.
5949016	5953499	Dance Dance Revolution Extreme, the official soundtrack, just came out on the 26th.
5955821	5956262	March 26th?
5956762	5958263	Oh yeah, how's it going?
5958343	5959144	Gee, Rob.
5959664	5961206	Get your chronology correct.
5961506	5965429	You know, because I said that because I thought I had heard reports that it was released this week.
5967970	5968190	I want!
5968230	5968590	I want!
5968610	5972551	I want!
5993536	5993936	I want.
5994376	5995457	And it has my fire again.
5995477	5996577	It has my fire on it twice.
5996837	5997077	Gimme.
5997237	5998157	No, no, it was just once.
5998217	5998537	I'm sorry.
5998917	5999237	Gimme.
6000258	6002358	You gotta go to Dance Media and get some.
6003158	6003578	I don't care.
6003658	6004579	My birthday is next month.
6004599	6005279	Someone buy that for me.
6005299	6007419	Alright, and that comes out on the 29th.
6007479	6008840	I want actually Best of Hardcore instead.
6008900	6009320	And what's this?
6009380	6010060	Disco Party 2.
6010380	6011140	I guess it's a video.
6011160	6011980	Super Disco Party.
6013381	6016061	So is disco replacing Parapar or something?
6016101	6018102	Is that why they got all these new videos and shit coming out?
6020307	6028393	How to Disco, you shake your ass I need to download that
6042304	6047148	I'm actually downloading Battle Royale, but I'm trying to find the special edition online.
6048229	6049870	Because I need a special edition.
6050411	6052152	I need, you know, extra scenes of death.
6054594	6055095	That's it.
6055175	6059338	Someone needs to do a music video to Battle Royale.
6060640	6065824	And then do, for the song, is Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.
6068996	6076260	You know, not to like, you know, travel back in time here, but, um, I don't know, DWI contest?
6077680	6079421	We just kind of, poof, forgot about?
6079921	6081702	Yes, speak on this.
6082782	6084163	I ain't speaking shit on this.
6084263	6088805	I got enough stuff to do with Rain and Website and doing God knows what other stuff.
6090186	6092607	This DWI contest, does that involve alcohol?
6094551	6108737	For Stepmania, we are having a contest where pick a TV song, not a remixed version, not a long version, just a TV theme song, and make steps for it.
6112258	6119481	We have one for Mr. Rogers, and it's kind of stupid.
6121542	6123463	I personally want to see one for Two Stupid Dogs.
6126292	6129454	You've seen Two Super Dogs, right?
6129614	6130355	That shit was cool.
6131695	6135077	I want one for Two Super Dogs.
6135337	6138539	And for Freakazoid.
6139099	6140180	I made one for Funky Brewster.
6140200	6141721	It's so slow.
6143422	6144242	So do it in double speed.
6147133	6150594	No, she's not.
6150634	6151734	She got her reduction.
6156576	6159577	She looked pretty hot in the Pumpkinhead movies, though.
6160617	6172100	Okay, first of all, I want to know what you think is more attractive, having really huge boobs and walking with a hunch, or having not as big boobs but still big and walking upright?
6172360	6172460	Big.
6173856	6176037	This is where you think you're going to get me, but you're wrong.
6176477	6178137	I didn't say big boobs at all.
6178317	6179317	I said she got boobs.
6180057	6181938	Firm breasts are what's good.
6182258	6183958	Firm breasts are the greatest.
6184238	6186939	I don't care if they have to be huge or what, but firm.
6187239	6190099	Firm breasts are what is awesome, okay?
6191199	6193420	If I'm allowed to touch them, it doesn't matter.
6195400	6198501	Loki, were you breastfed as a baby or not?
6200313	6203297	Wasn't, like, practically everyone on the face of the earth, pretty much.
6203458	6203638	No.
6204760	6205340	We'll see.
6205521	6207043	We know how you... Yeah.
6208265	6209186	Are you an 80s child?
6210548	6211890	I was when my mom used to cloth diapers.
6214233	6215415	I was a natural child.
6218234	6221196	I was told I was breastfed, but I refused it.
6223278	6231884	I'm sorry, but... My sister, they tried to breastfeed her and she was allergic to natural milk.
6233004	6233865	So it would make her sick.
6236107	6236947	How does that suck?
6238448	6239049	Like a baby.
6241050	6245473	Like, um, basically when it comes to a girl, I don't want knee slappers, you know?
6246094	6247815	I want them to sit where they're supposed to sit.
6250322	6251183	What on your face?
6252545	6254927	Alright, that seemed a bit too serious for me.
6254947	6255928	What, what on your face?
6258071	6260053	Alright, or anywhere else they need to sit.
6260595	6263917	All right, since he was being us, no, size does matter a little bit.
6264157	6265138	No knee slappers.
6265218	6267880	They need to kind of have somewhat of a firmness.
6267900	6270602	I mean, you don't want them going below the belly button, right?
6270742	6273023	No, really, actually, size is the huge thing.
6273123	6277106	I just don't want, like, when you're going to be 60, they're going to be hanging down to your knees.
6278127	6282970	I don't want you looking like some freaking huge freak with these giant breasts that look like God knows what.
6283751	6288454	And I also don't want you looking like a little boy, so... No, a little boy in J-Cups.
6291278	6292139	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6308035	6311756	And the Spice Channel presents the brand new Double O Size Bra
6326974	6346945	But you know what's weird, though, is, like, okay, because I took a picture with these two chicks when we went to the Easy Rider Bike Show, and they're, like, some of the models, and they basically, for the pictures, they sit in your lap, which is really sweet, but their breasts were, like, up against my chest, and it just, like, felt weird, because it was, like, unnaturally firm.
6346985	6347425	It was, like...
6348712	6358235	Not rocks, but like, it's like, they're these like, um, balls I've seen where they're kind of like, you know, those inflatable beach ball type things.
6359435	6363836	But they're like, they're a little bit firm, but it feels like an over-inflated beach ball.
6363936	6365756	I think they need to have their sailing changed.
6366557	6366797	Yeah.
6367617	6375039	Alright, what I think is incredibly stupid is there's these, um, and they're mostly novelty models, it's true.
6375914	6380916	This was a lot back when I was still in high school, watching Geraldo or something, one of those talk shows.
6381856	6386318	And they had these women on there who had had their chests enlarged to G-size and up.
6387278	6391100	And seriously, each boob was like the size of a small country.
6392100	6396702	It was like the size of a... They could have dropped those boobs on Iraq.
6397142	6401444	Not quite as big as Quaid, I'm thinking more like... Like Nixon's sign.
6403718	6405759	But they were huge.
6405779	6409681	They're going to need back braces when they're 50.
6409761	6422088	If they had their spine out of steel, then maybe that might work.
6423069	6428052	Usually I would be surprised that y'all could talk about her breasts for so long, but then I remember what show I'm on.
6434042	6435883	Don't you have a fascination with boobs?
6435923	6436884	Boobs are interesting.
6438284	6439645	I wouldn't want them for myself.
6441806	6442987	But yeah, boobs are funny.
6444088	6445769	Boobs are the punchline to a good joke.
6446789	6447690	Knock, knock, who's there?
6447730	6448130	Boobs!
6449031	6449511	Sweet.
6452372	6454574	On that note, why don't we get to this week's cage match?
6454594	6455294	What do you guys think?
6458076	6458856	I won last week.
6459056	6459837	What's a cage match?
6460517	6461418	We pick songs.
6462818	6463659	I'm sorry, I'm a noob.
6465431	6468872	Not me!
6471732	6475033	Anyway, the cage match is where we each pick a song.
6476153	6480054	And since we've been into it, one of us will have won last week, so our song remains over.
6480954	6482755	So the other two people will bring in a new song.
6483235	6487816	And chatroom votes on what they think is the best song, but we go around and rate it, sort of, you know, American Idol style.
6489236	6492797	You know, usually with our generous person here.
6493517	6494097	This, the...
6495629	6498391	Bipolar Person here, and the Super Cynic.
6500292	6502013	So, um, yeah, Cynic, you.
6504855	6506897	Um, and then our chatroom gets to vote.
6507277	6508298	We vote after all the songs are played.
6508638	6510339	And I'm special because I won last week.
6510619	6513861	But they hated my song from the week before, so we voted it off the island, and I picked a new one.
6515062	6518965	So... Alright, so we're getting to this week?
6519565	6520306	Alright, real quick.
6520566	6520786	Yes.
6520946	6523428	Fuck you with obscure Survivor references.
6523728	6524569	Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
6526201	6530665	So, uh, like, um, yeah, I've got my track and everything, but I've got two.
6531105	6534548	So do you guys want to hear a house track or a trance track?
6534949	6536670	A house track or a trance?
6536690	6540153	Do you want to let the chat room decide?
6540173	6541014	Do you want to let us decide?
6541034	6541434	Opera trance.
6542575	6549922	We have, we have, we have either, like, sort of disco-y, but really hard house, um, track, or we've got opera trance.
6550582	6550903	Mmm.
6550923	6551003	Mmm.
6554737	6557679	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6579727	6580728	Thanks for watching!
6638902	6639843	Beatbox with What A Wonderful World
6670283	6671063	All right, enjoy.
6671103	6672784	This is Loki's pick.
6672804	6673584	The title one more time?
6673724	6674685	Spente La Style.
6674765	6675605	Spente La Style.
6675645	6678327	Or if you just want to vote for it, you can call it Opera Trance.
6678387	6680728	But remember, you can't vote until we've played all three songs.
6680768	6682029	So here's the Opera Trance song.
6791488	6795710	Thank you for watching!
6892185	6897086	Alright, that was Spente Le Stelle from Opera Trance.
6898927	6902328	And by the way, that song is also on Dance Mania 20, did you know that?
6903128	6903508	Yeah, it is.
6904208	6905629	Anyway, that's kind of neat.
6906569	6907589	So, goodnight.
6908810	6909890	Okay, so here we go.
6910470	6911150	What did you guys think of that?
6911190	6911671	Go around the room.
6912071	6913611	It's cool, and I liked it once it picked up.
6913691	6914251	It gives an 8.
6916752	6917312	I like it.
6917372	6918412	I give it a 9.
6918593	6919953	I like opera stuff like that.
6921405	6925667	It reminds me of like techno mafia music, so I give it a 10.
6927707	6929828	I second that techno mafia stuff.
6930288	6931209	I give it 10 as well.
6932649	6934830	I was severely disappointed so much I gave it a 10.
6937461	6938521	It was okay, seven.
6941882	6942222	Okay.
6942842	6948243	I have a little bit of backstory to my pick, because I know I'm going to get shit for this, but I don't care.
6948463	6955805	Because everybody tells me I never can pick a song that wins, so I figure, fine, I'm going to go over the deep end this week.
6956625	6960866	But I decided that, you know, everybody says, oh, you've got to pick something from SyFam.
6960886	6961806	That's how you're going to win this.
6961846	6962987	You pick something from SyFam.
6963407	6963627	So...
6964467	6992240	I asked JB, oh give me a song from Syafam that's sure to win it And he said, you know what Rob, this song's very you And I think you'll like it, so I'm going to put this in the cage match tonight And this is DJ Speedo featuring Wild Side And Wild Side is, as you know, the group that did Irresistible Mint from DDR Extreme And the song is called Asoreje But you might know it as a different name And I'm so going to die, but I don't care
6993543	6995014	So, enjoy!
7188621	7190444	DarkSakura.com
7276144	7278146	That song makes me want to go to RBGL and murder children.
7278186	7278846	I give it a minus 58.
7278886	7279527	I give it shit.
7299994	7303617	Aw, that song was pretty poofy, pretty poofy.
7303657	7306018	Hey, hey, haha, let's give it a two.
7308656	7312857	Wait, we've got a little... Oh, okay, we've got a curling event.
7313597	7314657	MoCap curling!
7316077	7317098	Hello, Cage Match song.
7317458	7328540	Jason has got a vacuum cleaner head thing, and we've got a little ball rolling, and Mike's rolling the ball, and Jason is vacuuming the floor ahead of the ball.
7329700	7330360	Hello.
7330480	7332660	Back to Cage Match, Loki.
7332801	7334301	Anyway, here's Loki.
7336252	7338513	Okay, this song violated so many rules.
7338573	7341194	Number one, being a ketchup song, it sucked ass.
7341394	7343975	Number two, it was a speed mix, which really sucks ass.
7344495	7347577	And number three, I'm mad at Syfan right now, so that also sucked ass.
7348477	7350618	So I give the song an A for 100, but the curling gets a 10.
7355908	7369475	Alright, um, I hate that song just because it sounds too much like Happy Hardcore to me, and I can't stand Little Candy Kids, so I'm gonna give it a 3, because it had a decent beat to it, so 3.
7372156	7373296	Asian innovation.
7375498	7378019	Seeing that I left the room because the song sucks so much...
7379105	7382308	I'll give it a, out of a scale of 1 to 10, I'll give it a suck.
7384149	7388833	And, uh, of course, my pick, um, I thought it was wonderful, a 10, alright.
7391335	7392696	That balance is out to suck, doesn't it?
7392716	7394538	And fuck all you who can't take a joke, alright.
7394558	7396159	You sure are a damn liar.
7396520	7396600	And...
7397220	7400261	and Jamie gets a zero for hitting me in the nose with a ball.
7401101	7401701	I gave it a ten.
7401721	7403861	Now I have to get a new nose like Cher, Jesus.
7403961	7404761	I gave that a ten.
7404861	7405141	Alright.
7405822	7409122	Ron, I thought you'd be happy by getting me hit in the nose with a ball.
7409142	7411623	Let's review what you can pick tonight, shall we?
7412483	7419824	The first one that you can pick, and I have to I have to queue it up because I accidentally got rid of the CD.
7419844	7421564	Alright, here's the first one you can vote for.
7421644	7422144	Here's a clip.
7422524	7424785	Beatbox with What a Wonderful World, last week's winner.
7424805	7425645	And now the
7435248	7439313	Second one you can vote for, this is Spente La Stelle, also known as Opera Trance.
7439673	7440314	You can vote for that.
7450086	7455172	Also you can vote for DJ Speedo featuring Wild Side with Asareje, also known as the Catch-Up Song.
7465089	7466611	All right, you can vote for any one of those three.
7466692	7470838	Just send your votes right now over private message in the chat room to Sky.
7471299	7472681	If you vote for that, we will kill you.
7472701	7476166	And then we'll tally up those votes and let you know who wins a little later in the show.
7476206	7477849	And goddamn, I hope I win finally.
7480791	7483452	I think there's a lot of people vote for me just because they feel sorry for me.
7483993	7485153	Don't feel sorry for Rob.
7485293	7486774	This is the week I want to win.
7487634	7489896	Don't feel sorry for Rob.
7489936	7495538	Just keep in mind, if you vote for that song, you have to hear it for two weeks.
7495678	7497739	That's right, because there's no show next week.
7498039	7500841	So whatever wins tonight is two weeks.
7502142	7504385	So choose wisely.
7504505	7505907	Or we'll kill you.
7505927	7506128	My ball.
7506148	7506368	My ball.
7506388	7506708	My ball.
7506728	7506989	My ball.
7519705	7525173	Well, your song sucked so horribly we had to entertain ourselves and everyone else who was suffering in this room.
7525793	7526474	So we were curling.
7527396	7528978	It's an Olympic sport.
7529258	7535727	It doesn't get as much recognition as the other sports, but it's pretty hard because...
7537208	7539670	I mean, you have to be really athletic to be a curler.
7540430	7543153	Especially in the Olympics, because you have this broom, right?
7544133	7545935	And you kind of need to know how to skate.
7547096	7550679	And then you also... They have the ice shoes on, but it's still hard.
7550779	7559886	And you have to, like, you know... You gotta keep ahead of whatever... You have to keep ahead of the mallet ball thingy, hockey puck thing they do.
7559966	7560126	Right.
7561227	7563829	Yeah, and pretty much it's like a big lead weight.
7564049	7571054	Yeah, for all you curling fans out there, you have to, you know, depending on how fast, you have to get this target at the end.
7571474	7574296	I'm sweating my ass off and we just curled twice and it was only like 10 feet.
7574476	7579820	Yeah, and you know, you basically have to use the broom to reduce or increase the friction.
7579900	7581001	It's kind of weird, you know.
7581421	7582061	Simple point.
7582101	7587325	But yeah, the brooms are, only if hockey was played with brooms.
7588050	7589892	Man, the puck would go so much faster.
7590312	7592415	Simple point, it's a Canadian sport.
7593456	7597059	Just remember, look for me in Asian Innovation in the next Winter Olympics.
7597800	7600102	We'll be trying to represent Sacramento.
7600403	7605167	Team Sacramento, curling, 2008, in Beijing when they have no ice.
7607049	7607450	Let's go.
7607990	7609892	You know, you missed the show a couple weeks ago.
7609912	7613075	We were talking about different mocap games that they can make.
7613315	7614276	Mocap curling!
7614296	7615497	Mocap curling.
7615537	7615597	Yes!
7615617	7616518	That was brought up.
7618039	7620822	We did a list list, which we'll hopefully get to a list list segment tonight.
7620842	7621122	I don't know.
7621442	7625026	Although I'm thinking, you know, instead of list lists, you know what we haven't done in a long time?
7625726	7626967	Let's do a Bomani match game tonight.
7626987	7627488	What do you guys think?
7630034	7630655	Alright, you wanna do that?
7630815	7632096	Okay, we'll do my money match game tonight.
7632476	7633697	I'm a noob, you'll have to explain again.
7633717	7635298	That's alright, I can explain it to you guys.
7636279	7636819	I can do that.
7637620	7640782	If I can find match game theme on my computer somewhere, I hope so.
7643704	7646947	I could just come up with some porn themes off the top of my head.
7648228	7649729	We'll end the show with Ask Orange Lounge.
7650049	7650670	We'll do that later.
7653252	7655473	So, but we'll get to that in a little bit.
7656254	7658816	Because I have to have time to write up questions, so we have to take a break before we go to that.
7660732	7663255	I think he's going to want a filler because he's typing stuff right now.
7663275	7664156	Yeah, we need a filler.
7664456	7666839	Alright, let's go more porn music.
7666959	7667840	I'm too white for this.
7683186	7710375	I'M GERMAN FOR GOD'S SAKE WE DON'T MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH THIS REMINDS ME EXCUSIVE REMIX, REMIX FREAKIN' MOVIE, MALMOO'S MOST WANTED SUCKS ASS THAT MOVIE SUCKS ASS WHAT IS THE MOST IMPLICATING STUPID PIECE THAT SUCKS ASS BUT NOT THE GOOD MOVIES LIKE BUBBA HOTEP FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU ASIAN BEATBOXERS THAT CAN'T DO IT RIGHT
7712199	7715722	That was the beauty of silence, um, Fox Remix.
7715782	7718284	They're having, they have a request for some impromptu tumu.
7719004	7720045	You wanna do, want some?
7721606	7723047	The, the, you know, talking.
7726630	7736757	Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.
7740579	7741519	Oh, my dear good Lord.
7743720	7746161	I think now would be a very good time to take a break.
7746201	7749122	Hey, if you haven't sent in your votes already, there's not that many votes.
7750062	7757564	There's not that many votes in right now for Cage Match.
7758984	7763145	There's not that many votes in right now for Cage Match, which is, you know what happens when nobody votes?
7763426	7765246	The underdog wins.
7768007	7768287	All right.
7769093	7771374	When no one votes, we gang up on Robin, then we win.
7771394	7781801	Okay, if the underdog wins, I put zero votes, zero points for that opera trance, because it sucked ass, and I give ten to that crappy ass, sappy, hardcore wannabe shit.
7782421	7788264	Alright, so we'll be back after this quick break, and we'll talk about some Babani Match Game and your cage match winner.
7788384	7789205	We'll be back!
7815339	7817682	Where were you to hold my hand?
7818023	7828938	To the things that we have planned Yes, I need you by my side When things go crazy I just need to know you care
7891756	7892257	Thanks for watching!
7963842	7964417	Thanks for watching!
7994719	7995160	Thanks for watching!
8284461	8288704	Welcome to Orange Lunch Radio, where love is orange.
8289605	8291085	Shaving monkeys is always permitted.
8292226	8292666	Just kidding.
8292946	8301371	But... But it's... You scare the monkey, you don't come in.
8301471	8303593	No, no, I'll just bring Shermie.
8306280	8307921	If Shermie doesn't like you, leave.
8308282	8311824	A proceeding, as always, was brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.
8313045	8314666	Hello again.
8315707	8316247	We're back.
8316367	8317448	The monkey sling poo.
8318008	8320570	And I bet you'd love to know who won the cage match.
8322611	8323772	Well, it was very close.
8323812	8324552	And you know what's funny?
8324612	8326374	We had a vote for Oprah Trance.
8327816	8329318	Yeah, I bet Oprah's glad to hear that.
8329378	8330339	She needs to listen.
8330359	8335765	But, I hate to say this, but it did win by one vote.
8336386	8340490	It won by one stinking vote.
8340711	8342252	Ha ha, ha ha.
8344174	8345996	The chatroom conspired again.
8346097	8347138	Oprah Trance won it.
8349008	8351369	by one vote over the catch-up song.
8351409	8352149	I'm so mad.
8352909	8353749	Damn you, people.
8356790	8357630	See, they planned it out.
8357670	8361151	They wanted you to make you think you were going to win and then slide in that last vote.
8361632	8361992	I know.
8362012	8364012	They need to make the Big Fat Pickle song.
8364032	8365613	You're plotting against me, I cry.
8366053	8367013	The Big Fat Pickle song.
8368173	8369754	Someone make me a Big Fat Pickle song.
8373636	8381702	I'm a cucumber, I'm a cucumber, I'm a cucumber, I'm a cucumber, I'm a cucumber
8399574	8403158	I have a suggestion because I've been noticing that this game is kind of flawed in a way.
8404820	8414731	What we need to do is we need to get the answers from the contestants, but don't read them off and then get the answers from us first, then we get the contestants' answers.
8417153	8418515	You know what I'm saying?
8418795	8421358	Because then that way we're not influenced by their answers.
8425302	8426202	What are you doing?
8428723	8432665	Sorry, Darkchild's using the air duster on his head.
8434646	8435726	Seven people match game, that's fine.
8435766	8439568	We should do it like how we did it with Loaded Crescents and just show each other who brought our answers.
8439988	8440448	I agree.
8440788	8442849	Okay, we'll do that different this week and see how that works.
8442869	8444350	We'll read the contestants' answers last.
8444810	8450973	But, in order to get contestants, we have to have them answer a simple trivia question.
8452234	8455096	What is the formula for a mole?
8455176	8456257	I haven't been in school for a while.
8481019	8481879	She said a bunch of stuff.
8481899	8482360	How about this?
8483480	8484481	What's 75 squared?
8487562	8488322	What's 85 squared?
8491444	8495666	The only thing that I learned when I was in school was how to avoid people and what a mole is.
8497606	8500428	Which, by the way, is 6.02 times 10 to the negative 23rd power.
8501708	8502489	Alright, how about this?
8502509	8503369	We'll make it really easy.
8503389	8504389	Well, Kogan's boot size was a 16 in 1985.
8504429	8504890	No, I don't think so.
8504910	8505010	Sorry.
8509560	8516202	Okay, whoever is the first two people to tell me what the fifth digit of pi is.
8522103	8525504	Okay, the first two people who tell me, and you've got to send it over a private message or it doesn't count.
8525824	8526845	The fifth digit of pi.
8528265	8531246	Because that was a big topic on DDR Freak earlier this week.
8533046	8533486	It's I, right?
8533506	8534387	Okay, here we go, let's see.
8534407	8534427	I.
8538752	8543335	Okay, the fifth digit of pie is... I think the fifth digit of pie is pie.
8544696	8547879	It's the letter E. P-I-E-E-E.
8549380	8549620	Right?
8550521	8551101	Okay, let's see.
8551321	8553123	The fifth digit of me is my pinky.
8553163	8554924	The fifth digit of pie.
8556145	8557026	Alright, here we go, here we go.
8557066	8557586	Let's see who got it.
8557606	8558287	We got our winners.
8558567	8562270	So we got three, one, four, one, five.
8562990	8563551	So it's five.
8564511	8565032	Jazz...
8565973	8569255	Jazz said, well, he did say five, but he said four first.
8569315	8569715	Sorry.
8571236	8572957	JB got it, so JB's in.
8573117	8573757	He was next.
8574778	8575378	And let's see.
8577219	8579660	Well, it looks like we got 23rd Magus, so there you go.
8580460	8582942	I thought you were counting from the end of Pi.
8582982	8584342	No, sorry, I was not counting from the end of Pi.
8584362	8584703	So there you go.
8588188	8591369	That's why I said it, dumbass.
8591929	8593109	All right, here we go.
8593149	8594170	We got our two contestants.
8594190	8595690	We have JB and 23rd Magus.
8595750	8596390	All right, here we go.
8596670	8600591	Oh, the way the match name works, because you guys, not everybody's been here before.
8600771	8604632	We're going to read questions, and they'll have a blank in them, and we have to fill in the blank.
8604692	8608834	And if the contestants match what you say, then they get a point.
8609334	8611154	And what does our fabulous winner tonight get?
8611274	8613895	Now, they're both locals, so they can actually get a prize tonight.
8615127	8615587	Nothing!
8616107	8617068	Absolutely nothing!
8618068	8622149	You get a free magazine at March Madness.
8623389	8624730	Ooh, a magazine for the winner.
8624850	8625650	Okay, here we go.
8628551	8630791	And a half-eaten bottle of Pringles.
8631592	8632932	And a bright Twinkie.
8634172	8636233	Let's introduce the celebrities.
8636313	8640834	First off, celebrity number one, still wearing a lovely Versace gown.
8642075	8643235	Say hello to DarkSakura.

8684892	8685713	Give it up for Zero.
8685733	8686854	Hi.

8705500	8706521	Say hello to DarkSakura.
8707201	8707982	I was taken hostage.

8709563	8710443	These people are being mean to me.
8710463	8711143	They're torturing me.
8711584	8713125	They're making me listen to crappy trance.

8826192	8826812	You don't have to...
8834626	8836087	Alright, you ready?

8842670	8848013	Let's first, now we're doing it different this week, so we have the contestants locked in, let's see what the celebrities said.
8848393	8854896	Jamie, Mike got so angry that he decided to go to Scandia and... Play Prop Cycle instead.
8857258	8858538	Play Prop Cycle instead.
8859079	8861540	Anita, Mike got so angry he decided to...
8862754	8864074	Yodel at the top of his lungs.
8864994	8867095	Yodel at the top of his lungs!
8867835	8873076	Loki got so mad he decided to... start curling.
8875976	8876396	Zero.
8878257	8881297	He got so mad he mistakenly killed the Scandia kids instead of the RPGL kids.
8882998	8883498	Dark child?
8885318	8887278	Mike got so angry he decided to blow my mom.

8899941	8901762	Kill DJ Syndrome and make a fake song list.
8901782	8902122	Beautiful.
8902702	8907623	I said, Mike got so angry that he decided to go to Scandia and defecate on a child.
8912284	8914145	Alright, let's see what the contestants said.
8915365	8917906	JB said, roll on the ground.
8920111	8922032	No, I'm sorry, that is not a match.
8925414	8927196	23 Magus said, hump the coin slot.
8927236	8929637	He decided to run the Scandi and hump the coin slot.
8929657	8931598	Wow, I actually had to get on the machine then.
8933139	8933820	That's a good one.
8933940	8934780	I like that one.
8936862	8939243	Oh, can I change my answer to hump the coin slot?
8939263	8940364	No, you cannot change your answer.
8940424	8940744	Alright.
8941785	8943025	So, no points.
8943406	8944126	That's okay.
8944386	8945267	It's still a tie.
8946808	8948309	Let's go to the next question.
8949065	8949686	Question number two.
8950247	8953010	Darkchild has been out of the Bomani scene a long time.
8953391	8961501	He came back out of the darkness to see what was new in the scene, and he was surprised that the thing that had changed most in the scene was blank.
8976656	8979498	Wow, that sound of silence is like deep thought.
8979518	8980659	Okay, read it again.
9007389	9010131	Darkchild has been out of the Bomani scene a long time.
9010211	9017516	He came back out of the darkness to see what was new in the scene, and he was surprised that the thing that had changed most in the scene was blank.
9023960	9025140	Be very, very quiet.
9025181	9026041	People are thinking.
9028683	9030344	Is there all the celebrities about walked in?
9031204	9031925	A couple still writing.
9036556	9037897	I'm waiting on one contestant.
9042520	9043040	Any day now.
9043741	9045942	The thing that changed most in the scene was blank.
9049504	9050225	Yes, Jamie.
9057349	9058210	Come on, contestant.
9059431	9059851	Hurry it up.
9067878	9068718	Are all the celebrities done?
9068738	9069579	Yes, all the celebrities done.
9069859	9071219	We're waiting on a contestant.
9073300	9074240	Oh, I think we got it.
9076901	9077141	Okay.
9078241	9078641	Beautiful.
9079642	9080782	Jamie, your answer.
9082782	9084663	The only thing that had changed was the stench.
9084903	9087064	No one bothered to shower after still trying to PA Paranoia.
9087084	9088064	The stench.
9093468	9094008	All right.
9095369	9102533	Anita, the thing that had changed most in the scene was... Was all the DDR players were now wearing one white glove.
9104575	9108337	All the DDR players were now wearing one white glove.
9110418	9114980	Loki, the thing that had changed most in the scene was... I gotta follow that.
9115621	9115881	Yes.
9117142	9117262	Um...
9119053	9125559	I didn't really come up with anything funny, so all the DDR players are little kids that are really stupid and should die.
9126039	9128521	Okay, all the DDR players are little kids that are stupid and should die.
9128882	9129522	Okay, zero.
9130903	9135707	I couldn't come up with anything, so I figured the thing that changed the most was the child molesting gangbangers.
9136028	9137769	The child molesting gangbangers.
9138570	9139190	Dark Child!
9141012	9144555	I couldn't think of anything, so the number of white boys playing.
9144795	9146657	The number of white boys playing, thank you, thank you.
9148382	9151765	Alright, Butterfly is number two instead of number one on Player's Best now.
9153467	9154148	That's a good answer.
9155069	9160935	I put, the thing that changed most in the scene is that kids thought they could actually be cool by doing an online radio show.
9165799	9168042	Anyway, let's see what the contestants said if we have any matches.
9169283	9172086	23rd Magus says the thing that changed most in the scene was mocap golf.
9175959	9181162	JB says, the dirty little children at Roseville Golf Land had gotten a new soup called Cup of Child.
9181823	9183043	Oh, going for an inside joke.
9183083	9183424	Beautiful.
9184684	9185285	I'm sorry.
9187506	9188547	I don't know if that counts.
9188707	9189387	What do you guys think?
9189888	9191108	Who said the RVGL thing?
9191469	9192529	Somebody said something about RVGL.
9192549	9193030	Was that zero?
9194911	9195151	No.
9195551	9195811	Nobody.
9195871	9196312	Oh, okay.
9198813	9199714	Sorry.
9199794	9200534	I say zero.
9201755	9201975	None.
9202776	9203156	Zip, zip.
9203296	9203956	Okay, still tied.
9203976	9204237	Here we go.
9204277	9204677	Next question.
9206343	9210304	Jamie one day found herself on a deserted island with a shiny necklace on.
9213505	9216887	She noticed that she was surrounded by children from Roseville Golf Land.
9217647	9219608	The first thing she reached for was her blank.
9234537	9238321	Jamie one day found herself on a deserted island with a shiny necklace on.
9238381	9241485	She noticed that she was surrounded by children from Roseville Golf Land.
9241505	9243167	The first thing she reached for was her blank.
9244829	9247031	Alright, we have both our contestants in.
9247372	9248173	How about the celebrities?
9256568	9258571	Okay, working on it.
9259472	9260494	How are you doing, Anita?
9260854	9261255	About ready?
9261475	9261996	Almost done.
9262777	9264399	Anita doing another marathon answer.
9266582	9266922	Okay.
9270828	9271469	Alright, Jamie.
9272882	9275284	woke up on a deserted island with a shiny necklace on.
9275324	9277566	She noticed she was surrounded by children from Roseville Golf Land.
9277586	9279828	The first thing she reached for was her blank.
9280248	9280489	Ready?
9280969	9282991	Jamie, what was the first thing Jamie reached for?
9283451	9283871	Propel.
9284632	9286173	RPGL children are easy targets.
9287875	9293820	All right, Anita, the first thing she reached for was her... Was her coconut nunchakus to open up a can of whoop-ass.
9294520	9295741	Her coconut nunchakus.
9296902	9297723	Loki.
9299665	9299965	Loki.
9300973	9301853	It should be obvious.
9302114	9302694	Orange bat.
9303234	9304515	Her orange bat!
9305215	9305435	Oh!
9305555	9306335	Good answer!
9307376	9308116	Good answer!
9308636	9317460	Zero, the first thing she reached for was her... Well, with Jamie being surrounded by RVGL kids with their shiny new necklace on, I say, she reached for her necklace to take it off.
9322203	9327425	Being surrounded by Rosal Goughland children, I'm... You know, I reached for my own.
9331018	9333639	Dude, I just ripped theirs off.
9335920	9336440	Dark Child.
9337120	9338180	God, my mind is dirty.
9339781	9341861	A jizz rag to wipe off that shiny necklace.
9342201	9346302	I need to stay off the internet.
9353587	9354167	Oh my lord.
9354267	9355648	Okay, Asian Invasion.
9355808	9360909	After that happened, the first thing she reached for was her... Immediately after that, she reached for her crack pipe.
9363990	9364510	Jamie!
9365211	9366071	You have a crack pipe?
9367111	9367411	Alright.
9368092	9370692	I said the first thing she reached for was her fan.
9371533	9372193	Remember the movie?
9372713	9373413	The guy with the fan?
9373533	9375234	Yeah, alright.
9377054	9377314	Okay.
9378315	9381276	JB said the first thing she reached for... Let's check for a match.
9381296	9381976	I said the fan was cool.
9384184	9385345	We're going to check for a match.
9386425	9388687	JB said the first thing she reached for was a fork.
9388987	9390088	I almost said that.
9390408	9391969	I almost said fork.
9391989	9396011	But then again, RPGL children have herpes.
9396091	9399273	23rd Magus said the first thing she reached for was her boomstick.
9402035	9402896	Good movie reference.
9403676	9404697	Very good movie reference.
9405257	9406298	Sam Raimi is God.
9406958	9408079	It's still tied up.
9411553	9413315	It's still tied up at nothing, nothing.
9413355	9414997	Alright, let's go on to the next one.
9415277	9415597	Alright.
9416398	9416819	Loki!
9419041	9422945	Loki was really excited to be moving into a new apartment very soon.
9424227	9426929	A couple days before the move, though, he started to worry.
9427790	9430954	What am I going to do about packing my massive collection of blank?
9435810	9437231	It doesn't have to be the obvious.
9437312	9438152	Do whatever you want.
9438212	9440054	You've got to want to match the contestants.
9440434	9441595	Do say what the contestants would say.
9442576	9445318	Loki was really excited to be moving into a new apartment very soon.
9445858	9447820	A couple days before the move, though, he started to worry.
9447860	9451262	What am I going to do about packing my massive collection of blank?
9455866	9457267	I came up with an answer very quickly.
9463212	9464493	We have one contestant locked in.
9466824	9468065	I think that's both contestants.
9469906	9470207	All right.
9472929	9474050	Are all the celebrities ready?
9479554	9480895	Okay, I'm almost ready.
9481235	9481695	Almost.
9481915	9482236	Okay.
9482676	9484737	How do you spell... Never mind.
9486899	9488020	How do you spell V?
9488040	9488060	V?
9490737	9491598	All right, here we go, Jamie.
9492259	9495241	Loki had to pack his massive collection of... Corpses.
9495562	9496302	Corpses!
9497624	9498665	Good idea.
9500406	9505371	Anita said, what am I going to do about packing my massive collection of... Of Barbie dolls.
9505511	9506852	Barbie dolls.
9507133	9507973	Oh, so cute.
9510356	9511477	Okay.
9512718	9513038	Loki.
9513699	9514259	Dead babies.
9514700	9515661	Dead babies!
9519068	9519389	Zero.
9519949	9520750	I said shit.
9522512	9523894	Massive collection of shit.
9523934	9524354	How nice.
9524455	9524815	Okay.
9526737	9527418	Dark Child.
9529000	9529701	Real dolls.
9530942	9531643	Real dolls.
9532544	9532765	Oh!
9533285	9534587	You know the... The...
9535011	9539996	For those who don't know, they're really high-end, non-blow-up girlfriends.
9540116	9542459	I mean, fully articulate, they look realistic.
9543020	9546744	On Real Sex, a guy's girlfriend... And they have men ones, too, with, like, big cocks.
9547084	9548285	I don't care about the men ones.
9548425	9550447	And they said that they were working on ones that actually came.
9550728	9551248	RealDoll.com
9553211	9554112	I'm sorry, not a match.
9554132	9559777	I said, Loki, what is he going to do about packing his massive collection of cock rings?
9559817	9560657	Cock rings, God.
9560717	9564100	Alright, let's see what the contestants said.
9581317	9582598	Let's see if we get a match.
9582718	9586341	23rd Magus says, What is Loki going to do about packing his massive collection of porn?
9589204	9593167	JB says, What is he going to do about packing his massive collection of porn?
9593568	9595209	Both contestants said porn.
9595710	9596250	No match.
9596951	9598952	It's funny that all the underage people think of porn.
9600213	9601615	Shame on all of you perverts.
9602595	9603897	We think of murder, right?
9605379	9607520	I don't have a massive collection of porn.
9607640	9610241	It's way outweighed by the massive collection of dead babies.
9610582	9611522	Last question.
9611562	9613143	This is your chance to shine.
9613543	9617525	Just to be fair, I was going to say porn, but I thought someone else in the group would have already taken it.
9619026	9621707	Alright, well, it's still tied up.
9621767	9622207	Nothing, nothing.
9622227	9623348	Here's your last question.
9628197	9632239	Rob got made a lot of fun of for playing the catch-up song on Orange Lounge Radio.
9632939	9636500	After the show was over, the room decided that his punishment should be blank.
9657379	9661422	Alright, Rob got made a lot of fun of for playing the catch-up song on Orange Lounge Radio.
9661962	9664805	After the show was over, the room decided that his punishment should be blank.
9668707	9670609	Okay, we have both our contestants locked in.
9670669	9672410	Is everybody else in the room?
9673251	9673511	Anita?
9677394	9679115	I'm just writing my chapters.
9680231	9680972	Okay, here we go.
9681292	9682833	Jamie, his punishment should be?
9683233	9684334	To drink his weight in ketchup.
9684794	9686315	To drink his weight in ketchup.
9686335	9687296	That's a lot of ketchup.
9688637	9690098	Oh, I didn't get quite as creative.
9691599	9695501	Your punishment shall be to watch 24 hours of the Playboy channel.
9700069	9701630	God, and softcore at that.
9701690	9702071	Jesus.
9702091	9703192	At least it was hardcore.
9703232	9704052	It's somewhat exciting.
9704072	9705633	You would fall asleep after about two minutes.
9705653	9706114	I would seriously.
9706134	9708816	I would fall asleep after about, like, a few minutes of that.
9709336	9710137	It's awful.
9710177	9711238	About five minutes for Loki?
9711678	9713219	Uh, serious.
9713380	9714841	It's just like, look at me.
9715121	9716162	I'm rubbing my breasts.
9716322	9718484	I mean, it's just like, who cares?
9718944	9722607	It's so, why are you, like, sneaking into some person's house to rub your breasts?
9722627	9723648	It makes no sense.
9725509	9728770	Yeah, but it makes no sense when you're just standing there going, oh, look at me.
9728910	9733871	I'm standing here in the wind, exotic location, rubbing my breasts for no reason.
9734391	9735472	Just standing there.
9735612	9736632	She's not having sex.
9736672	9739633	She's not, like, you know, getting it on or anything.
9739673	9742514	She's just standing there saying, look at me.
9743214	9744694	I'm sexy looking.
9745194	9747635	If you had the Playboy channel on my house, I'd end up turning it to CNN.
9748055	9752296	Dude, let's put it this way, I get every single Playboy movie that comes out, and they all suck ass.
9752576	9761539	They're all regurgitated clips from older Playboy movies, and it's just, it's awful, they try to think... Girl's gone boring.
9762099	9765840	Okay, my answer was, punishment would be Rob would have to go straight.
9767300	9768141	I almost said that.
9769481	9773062	And by the way, they probably rub their breasts because it's cold on the beach, they gotta get warm.
9773669	9776011	I don't understand how their nipples stick out all the time.
9776872	9777873	How is that possible?
9778514	9780376	Ice cubes, but... No, I don't want them.
9786482	9788404	I said... It's called airbrushing.
9789425	9793689	I said... I said at the end of the show, Rob would have to fuck... the ferret.
9796966	9797466	How lovely.
9798027	9798507	Dark Child.
9799388	9802549	Rob's punishment should be... Jesus Christ, I am a child of the internet.
9803190	9805491	Go down on everyone in the room and swallow.
9806652	9806832	Ah!
9807252	9808793	That is punishment, Jesus.
9809994	9811315	That's punishment for everybody.
9821561	9823462	You get to sell popcorn, there'll be plenty of salt.
9823602	9823942	Alright.
9825423	9826384	It's an innovation.
9828550	9829851	Porn is the funniest thing ever.
9830631	9831972	It's not exciting or anything.
9832072	9832772	It's just funny.
9835113	9835794	Easy and innovation.
9835854	9838415	Rob's punishment should be the ketchup song.
9842077	9842297	Good.
9842377	9842817	Good answer.
9843858	9848200	And my answer would be that Rob's punishment should be to have sex with lots of hot people.
9853823	9855243	It sounds like a great punishment to me.
9855664	9855964	Rob.
9856084	9857645	I agree.
9857665	9858105	Say that again.
9859795	9860756	Who have leprosy?
9862737	9863557	Rob, hand.
9867360	9868921	Let's see if we actually got a match.
9869561	9872323	JB said Rob's punishment should be to be spanked.
9875465	9877446	That's a reward, babe.
9877526	9878627	It depends who by.
9878967	9881429	I mean, if we're talking like, you know, never mind.
9884436	9887920	23rd Magus said his punishment should be to be beaten with orange bats.
9888180	9889461	Nobody said go straight.
9889802	9892224	You guys could not have said go straight.
9892584	9893805	That was the most obvious answer.
9894266	9895387	Why do you think I'm kidding?
9896968	9897589	I don't know.
9898390	9899110	You tell me.
9900351	9905596	It's okay because boys are stupid anyway, except present company.
9908217	9908737	on that note.
9909378	9910938	So, we have our big finish.
9911279	9912579	The big scores, here they are.
9912659	9913640	Let's total it up.
9915300	9917481	JB has a score of zero.
9918582	9920823	And 23 Magus has a score of zero.
9921904	9922924	You win nothing.
9923444	9924505	Nothing at all.
9924825	9925785	Good day, sir.
9925865	9926286	Wow.
9926406	9928066	You couldn't even get a magazine.
9928106	9928687	That's pretty sad.
9928747	9929767	So, this is what happens.
9930468	9931168	As punishment,
9931917	9934758	You two get all of the punishments that were mentioned earlier.
9934838	9935478	So there you go.
9936118	9937039	Live at March Madness.
9937699	9942500	They get to be spanked, anally raped, and then get hot people.
9943080	9944281	And then go down on all of us.
9944861	9947682	They're underage!
9948142	9955144	Hey, but remember, one of your punishments was... Hey Rob, one of the punishments was getting to have sex with a bunch of hot people.
9957064	9957704	That's true!
9957825	9958945	I'd throw the game for that one.
9960885	9961546	That's very true.
9961686	9963647	Yeah, but I'll take the game back for the fair.
9963667	9963907	No.
9964267	9964928	That ain't happening.
9966309	9966649	Alright.
9967410	9970432	So, um... They're demanding a tiebreaker, but you know what?
9970472	9971072	We don't have much time.
9971092	9973594	Because we have to take a quick break, and then we're going to come back and wrap up the show.
9978938	9979338	Take a break.
9979378	9981060	Take a small break, but we'll come back for our special.
9984442	9987965	Small break, one song, and this is your chance to ask Orange Lounge.
9988205	9989826	Or, tonight, you can ask...
9991240	9992143	Who's fucking with the mic?
9994335	9996537	or tonight... I have the mic.
9996937	9999299	Or tonight, you get alienly raped by the ferret.
10000239	10005623	No, tonight you can either ask Orange Lounge or you can ask Dark Child or you can ask Asian Innovation.
10005643	10007985	Just send those to the chat room.
10008265	10010367	And if you're not in our chat room, fucking get in there.
10010467	10015270	Go to KaliBamani.com and then click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.
10015330	10016511	It's super duper easy.
10016531	10017412	Why aren't you here already?
10018493	10019773	What do you guys think for a break song?
10020354	10021114	Something from DDR, something from GDX.
10021134	10021855	Something annoying.
10022255	10023036	Something annoying?
10023544	10024245	Play Orion.
10025926	10026767	Yeah, play Blue Moon Dollar.
10026947	10031551	All right, so it'll be a quick break, and we'll be right back after Ask Orange Lounge.
10031571	10033233	So send your questions to Sky in the chat room.
10068971	10069717	Thanks for watching!
10117691	10120972	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.
10121512	10123233	Orange Lounge Radio.
10125654	10126094	Ha ha.
10126794	10127095	Okay.
10128975	10129816	Oops.
10130056	10131116	Nope, we're not doing Match Game anymore.
10131136	10132196	I have to queue up the other music.
10132517	10136758	So this is a little segment we do when we need some time filler.
10137358	10141200	Because our chat room is very creative, so we allow them to ask Orange Lounge.
10142640	10143441	So here we go.
10145762	10146802	Show's ten minutes longer.
10148414	10149415	Ask us questions.
10149435	10150215	Here we go.
10152596	10158318	Ask Orange Lounge, or tonight you can ask Dark Child or Asian Innovation.
10158498	10164261	23rd Magus says, seriously though, if I beg and plead enough, will Orange Lounge sponsor me for March Madness?
10164301	10166182	I'm already making my Orange Lounge shirt.
10169203	10172124	If I endure all punishments mentioned, will I get sponsored?
10173204	10174085	That would be amusing.
10176646	10177006	It's a guy.
10180816	10182598	Well, should we consider it?
10183238	10184099	We'll consider it.
10185360	10185981	We have to see.
10186001	10186321	We'll see.
10186341	10188183	Keep in mind that one of us is unemployed.
10190806	10194749	If you could out-drink me on Bacardi 151, I will sponsor you.
10196231	10197332	I'll pay your win.
10197532	10200255	Come to think of it, I think it would be worth it to see his freestyle.
10203516	10204117	I'll do it.
10204197	10205038	Yeah, one of us will do it.
10205238	10205818	We'll figure it out.
10206139	10210663	But you need to try and come up with the money yourself, because if we have to sponsor you, we're making you do something humiliating.
10214467	10214968	Alright.
10219830	10223511	Justin S, your jazz, sorry, I just gave you a real name over the air, my bad.
10223972	10226753	To everyone, can I have about $100 and a ride to March Madness?
10226893	10227073	No.
10227213	10229294	I'll bring Clock Tower 3 and bad horror movies.
10229955	10233296	Um, I can't give you a ride, but you can, like, hang out.
10233776	10237939	You know, um, you can certainly stay at the Orange Lounge World Headquarters, a.k.a.
10237979	10240580	my house, if you can, uh, find a ride here.
10240680	10242661	If you just post on DDR Freak, you might be able to find something.
10245293	10251599	DarkTetsuya says, are we, me slash 23Maggots, still on for hosting Orange Lounge Radio next weekend?
10252040	10253261	No, you fool!
10253842	10257886	Me, DarkSakura, and Loki are the hosts of Orange Lounge Radio, but you guys can guest.
10258326	10259507	Yeah, you get to help.
10260368	10260869	You can help.
10264730	10274539	John Fields wants to know, how much of a hero would someone be if he or she created a DWI of a DDR non-stop megamix all custom steps?
10274879	10275760	Oh my god!
10277101	10278863	I'm so excited!
10280484	10283347	That would be long and I would fall over dead.
10284562	10285023	No!
10285583	10286044	Stop!
10286584	10287825	Well, here's what people are doing, though.
10287845	10291728	They're making steps for tracks off of the non-stop.
10292188	10294590	Single tracks, okay, as long as the steps are good.
10295170	10298012	Full non-stop, that's the stupidest idea ever.
10298272	10300594	What do you think you are, DWI Insanity or something?
10301174	10305757	I mean, it's not... I mean, they're the ones that make the 45-minute long ones.
10305857	10306318	Stop it.
10306398	10309240	Don't try to be... Come up with something original.
10314529	10315270	I got mail!
10315330	10316031	Yay!
10316772	10317453	I got mail!
10317673	10318594	I got mail!
10318834	10319976	Yay!
10324881	10327665	We have a question for Asian Innovation from DDR Mike.
10328606	10329547	We have two questions.
10332562	10335044	How much weight did you put on from yesterday's party?
10336325	10337406	I only had two ribs.
10338607	10339667	But, yeah.
10341309	10344711	And then, how was that horrible, wonderful job at Jack in the Box?
10346733	10348374	I don't know, I gave most of the food to you.
10352438	10352838	Beautiful.
10353438	10357120	And that's all the questions I've gotten so far for Ask Orange Lounge.
10357140	10358921	So we'll give them a couple more minutes.
10359581	10361082	You're not funny, Mike.
10361122	10361722	Quit laughing.
10364983	10367424	Does anybody have a question for someone else here in the room?
10369825	10370646	Will someone hire me?
10372146	10372446	Please.
10373667	10374967	What are your job qualifications?
10376048	10377589	Well, my resume is on Rob's computer.
10383428	10386929	Is that resume in MPEG or QuickTime?
10387029	10389530	Okay, Rob, you sat and watched Ally McFeel with me.
10390870	10391771	Oh my god, you are gay.
10391791	10395932	That was the funniest porn ever.
10397432	10398753	Ally McFeel had fucking Ron Jeremy in it.
10398793	10399333	It was awesome.
10400693	10401153	Sweet.
10401854	10402894	Ron Jeremy is a god.
10404754	10406675	Have you seen Porn Star, The Legend of Ron Jeremy?
10407315	10407895	No, I have not.
10407915	10408575	It's a sweet movie.
10409096	10409356	Rent it.
10409596	10410016	Is it porn?
10410518	10416761	It's not actually porn, but I mean, they have like little clips and things, but it's still kind of, it's NC-17, but not really like porn.
10416861	10417942	What's this word, rent?
10418522	10420003	I don't understand this word, rent.
10420363	10420684	Rent.
10421264	10422324	I have Kazaa.
10422404	10422965	What's rent?
10424125	10425706	Is that when I delete it after I watch it?
10426367	10427067	Yes, yes.
10427347	10430449	That's when you, you only have 24 hours after downloading this.
10431950	10432190	Okay.
10432490	10433090	More questions.
10434031	10435111	I have a question for the chat room.
10436452	10439954	Anyone in there, find me Battle Royale Special Edition and buy it for me.
10441232	10442513	I have a question for the chat room.
10442793	10443074	Uh-huh?
10443674	10445256	Do I know anyone in the chat room?
10445556	10445836	I don't know.
10445856	10446417	Want to come look?
10446877	10447217	The list?
10447718	10447978	Oh, no.
10447998	10448959	They might have changed their names.
10449499	10450020	That's very true.
10451421	10453263	Okay, John Fields has a follow-up project.
10454093	10458436	He says, let me plug, oh, this isn't the plug segment, this is the ask segment, but fine, I'll let you get away with it.
10458897	10469004	Let me plug a project I'm working on then, http://www.squaredancedance.tk That's a little scary, let's look at the site real fast.
10469224	10470325	Loki, what do you think of this?
10471926	10473147	Oh, wait, I think I've heard of this.
10473715	10479518	SquareDance is just those remixed Final Fantasy and Square songs.
10480959	10484821	And I know there's a guy that's been releasing DWIs for them.
10485702	10486662	I think I played one of those.
10486682	10488624	I have a splitting headache and it hurts!
10489724	10491185	Didn't I play one of those the other night?
10492005	10492526	At your party?
10492566	10493907	I think you have all these already.
10494547	10495568	I think I played one of them.
10495828	10496128	Yeah, I...
10497526	10498687	I think Squaresoft Rocks.
10499428	10500468	I'll go to that page a lot.
10502010	10503691	But that's not Orange Line talking, that's just me.
10504592	10508055	DDR Mike, by the way, says, Her, her, shut up, squinty-eyed Asian hoe.
10514320	10515240	Why did he call you a hoe?
10517748	10518908	I'll be over at your house tonight at 11.
10521969	10522349	All right.
10522749	10523590	You other hoe.
10524470	10528191	DarkTetsuya wants to know, how come more females don't come in the chat room?
10528231	10528551	Cry.
10530972	10532792	That's because there's no one there who excites them enough.
10533552	10534513	They're too busy cooking.
10536833	10539734	Are there females coming in the chat room right now?
10540459	10544622	First of all, they don't come in the chatroom because it'll make a big stinky mess.
10545202	10546543	They don't come because you haven't found the G-spot.
10546784	10548044	It's because I haven't been here yet.
10548665	10551887	Because I can't come when you fuck me.
10552628	10554889	Yeah, if a girl was coming, she wouldn't be in the chatroom.
10557351	10557731	Alright.
10559873	10560753	Last one.
10561214	10561674	Last one.
10561714	10562034	Here we go.
10562094	10565957	Last question from Justin Circuit says, can you give me money?
10568019	10569039	Depends on what you'll do for me.
10569279	10569920	I'll give you a dollar.
10570680	10571600	Can you give me stuff?
10572981	10573821	Can you give me head?
10575482	10576202	From Justin?
10577522	10578263	I'll close my eyes.
10580983	10581384	Alright.
10584665	10586225	I'll give him money from Argentina.
10587406	10590467	Okay, so, on that note, that's the end of Ask Orange Lounge.
10590487	10592067	Alright, one more, there's one more, there's one more.
10593808	10594908	One more, this is the last question.
10594928	10597209	This is a good one to end it on because it kind of relates to March Madness.
10597229	10597269	Oh!
10598220	10604301	Skyline DC505 wants to know, would doing bag five speed for the qualifier be noobish?
10606542	10607602	Go ahead, I don't care.
10608642	10610162	Just do it on one speed later on.
10610342	10610783	Have fun.
10613423	10616764	Okay, and now's that time of the show where we have to wrap it up.
10616984	10619424	But first, we go around the room and get everyone's final thoughts.
10620544	10622205	Rob, can we wrap it up in ribbon and bows?
10623725	10624285	And confetti.
10624805	10625205	And leather.
10626566	10627046	And chains.
10627506	10627886	And whips.
10629713	10630853	Okay, now I'm getting into this.
10633054	10635295	And, and, like, playing hot pokers.
10638277	10645059	I don't have much to say, how about... Pikachu!
10645099	10651842	All I gotta say is, uh, unfortunately there will not be an update to my site tonight or tomorrow because I have a headache and I'll probably be going to sleep.
10653283	10654263	So maybe Tuesday.
10658365	10658705	What? !
10660896	10662077	What the hell's your problem, man?
10663898	10667161	You're a savior because you don't have one of those live doll things.
10667201	10670384	Real dolls, whatever it is.
10674987	10679711	Um, I accept this award on the behalf of myself because you all suck.
10680832	10682413	And one last thing, you are cool.
10685155	10685976	You're so cute.
10686877	10688318	You're the coolest girl in the world.
10690713	10693114	I declare war on Iraq because I'm a Texan.
10693194	10693874	Bang, bang, bang.
10693954	10694514	I'm a Texan.
10694594	10695094	Bang, bang.
10699776	10701897	April 15th, go buy your Miyazaki films.
10701937	10706739	Castle in the Sky, Spirited Away, and Kiki's Delivery Service come out on DVD in English.
10708320	10710481	And April 19th is my birthday, so give me stuff.
10712962	10713762	Your final thought, Mike?
10714127	10715449	Go to March Madness, please.
10715549	10717032	I don't want to turn on, like, five people.
10717152	10717412	All right.
10717452	10717733	Thanks.
10717793	10718073	Bye.
10719055	10721860	My final thought is Zelda comes out tomorrow.
10722160	10722941	Is anyone moist?
10724844	10725866	Has anyone already played it?
10727989	10728290	All right.
10729946	10730447	That's it.
10730807	10731448	End of show.
10731548	10737454	Don't forget, no show next week because we're live all day long, Saturday and Sunday.
10737654	10741017	Listen, for God's sake, or at least come to the tournament.
10741097	10743300	Because if nobody listens, we'll never do it again.
10743320	10743800	Just kidding.
10743820	10747043	We're already planning on doing it at B3 as well, but not after that.
10747204	10748785	All right.
10748825	10749746	Thank you very much for listening.
10749906	10750967	It's 44 Times Radio.
10751248	10751708	We love you.
10752049	10753270	The system is down.
10754620	10755060	Go, go, Power Rangers!
10781468	10781868	Hey, dude!
10781888	10782549	Hey, you just changed!
10782569	10783790	Yeah, I know, we always change characters every day.
10783810	10784170	Oh, okay.
10784210	10785451	Hey, I'm a little kid and I'm gonna join the Power Rangers.
10785471	10785992	How do you know about us?
10786012	10786832	Because I watch the show every day.
10786872	10787133	Oh, okay.
10787273	10792697	Hey, guys, look, it's those three teenagers that exactly match the Power Rangers personalities and their voices and every single thing about them.
10792797	10793318	Let's go harass them.
10793518	10794218	Okay, Bull, come on.
10794358	10794959	Okay, cool.
10795179	10796220	Hey, we know praying mantis.
10796240	10799663	Hey, you're not supposed to kick around, Bull.
10799683	10802285	What's that?
10802305	10803126	Rangers, Rangers, what?
10803146	10804887	Power Rangers, what do you know?
10806008	10806949	Fire teenagers with attitude.
10807813	10808113	What's wrong?
10808173	10808833	What's going on?
10808853	10810254	There's a bunch of disturbances going on.
10810474	10810734	Oh, really?
10810754	10811274	You better check it out.
10811854	10814115	Oh, no, it's a monster that's terrorizing the city.
10814135	10815275	What are you doing here?
10815595	10816256	I'm the master of the world.
10816296	10816876	I'm a giant pig.
10817056	10818596	I eat stuff.
10818776	10822998	Oh, no, we need to destroy him.
10823018	10823458	Posing.
10823498	10824118	Moving around.
10824238	10830880	We are the Avengers, and we are going... Oh, yeah, well, uh, yeah, well, you weren't smart enough to call upon your Megazords now.
10830900	10831500	Whoa, what the heck?
10831640	10835261	Oh, no, we need to call upon the Megazord Megazord.
10835281	10835401	Fusion.
10838796	10840877	Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.
