1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,360
Did you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:21,080
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk and then some.

00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,320

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,060
Orange Lounge may contain many four letter words.

5
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,340

00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,940
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

7
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:35,940
Just kidding.

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,220
Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

9
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,220
In this episode...

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,220
Hey, are there any balls down there?

11
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,220
That's the biggest bear you've ever seen, Jingle Bear.

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,220
What's your favorite scary movie?

13
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,220
Showgirls.

00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,220

16
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:56,140
There are no stupid questions.

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,140
Just stupid people.

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,640
Torture yourself? That's my job.

I know kung-fu.

22
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,140
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,640
Why did they have to take the word gang?

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,640
No! What I expect for punishing physicians is kendo.

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,640

Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,140
Lowkey.

31
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,140
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

32
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,140
What kind of war human being would find that funny?

Hopefully they didn't get lost. You did draw them a good map, right?

72
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,980
Of course. I gave written directions and then I drew a map that showed which house you chose.

73
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,580

members.al.com slash dark Sakura slash scattles dot jpg I think that's it

115
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,820
that's what I do when I'm bored is I take products and then make like foul

116
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:13,300
approximates of them it's either dot jpg or dot gif I don't know that's what I do

117
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:21,380
do when I get bored, I find meat products. It is.jpg. No, not meat. I find products

118
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,300
and then I make them a little bit different. You should have made them all brown though,

119
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,900
instead of like, what? I'm being summoned. They're meant. They're supposed to give your

120
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:40,720
ass a minty fresh taste. Yes. Question from the chat room. Did the Disney version of Spirited

121
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,920
away win or did the original Japanese one well it would be the Disney one but

122
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,280
that's because well I don't really know why that is I think that's just because

123
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:54,040
it's a to the Oscars it's the same movie just a different language track but it's

124
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:00,320
still the same visual I don't know but yeah the Disney one won anyway wow what

125
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,120
a busy busy week I'm so exhausted after this and I was impressed she pronounced

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,760

127
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:15,760

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,360
for her to give me a little bit

131
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,520
anyway

132
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
uh...

133
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,280
kind of a crazy weekend just to think that next week's even gonna be crazy

134
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,400
reason march madness is coming up

135
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,720
at the end of the week he the second

136
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,360
tournament i've done

137
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
that's been around times of unemployment for me.

138
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,360
Give me a job!

139
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,360
That lion is demonic.

140
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
That lion is demonic.

141
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,360
Um...

142
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
Yes, we have March Madness coming up,

143
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,360
which, by the way, means there will be no live show next Sunday, because...

144
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,360
We'll be live all day Saturday and Sunday.

145
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,360
I'll be all over the freakin' place.

146
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
Oh my God.

147
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,360
It's gonna be like, like Shaft was, except I get to do it for two days.

148
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,360
And Loki, once again, gets to, uh, head up taking the reins all by himself.

149
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Hey, what are you guys doing?

150
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,360
I will be helping you 90% of the time.

151
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,360
But I have to emcee the 2DX tournament.

152
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,360
And then I'm going to be participating in one event, but I can't say what.

153
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,360
I'm doing everything else.

154
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Well, at least on the admin side.

155
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
Yes.

156
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360
But you'll be by to say hello, right?

157
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,360
Getting volunteers, offering them potato chips and not paying anybody.

158
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,360
You'll say hi on the show, right?

159
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Of course.

160
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:43,640
I think it'll be like this what's gonna be really cool about March Madness is

161
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,520
that the machines gonna be set up outside from what I understand but

162
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,960
they're gonna don't worry for those of you they're worried about glare don't

163
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,200
worry about it staffs already thought about it they're gonna just kind of set

164
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,680
it up in like this tent thing with a lot of tarp and they're gonna set it

165
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,520
perpendicular to Sun they have this all worked out so don't worry you won't be

166
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,800
able to get any glare on that so but what's cool about that this is the

167
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,680
machines outside, we're gonna be, for any of those that have ever been to Scandia before,

168
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,320
we're gonna be out in the gazebo. So, you can't miss us. They can't, this is what's

169
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,920
cool about Scandia and letting us do that tournament there. They cancelled all the parties

170
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,280
so we could have the party room and the gazebo, and Orange Lounge gets the gazebos, that's

171
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:25,200
pretty cool. Word children, screw your birthday, we're having a DDR tournament. Word of advice,

172
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,320
word of advice, if you're coming down to the tournament at Sacramento Scandia, and we hope

173
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,520
come early because it's gonna fill up fast like the parking lot I'm talking

174
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,320
about because there's a lot of people expected to show up next Saturday

175
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,960
between the normal patrons and the DDR tournament so come early to be sure that

176
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:51,120
you can actually like park nearby what are you mewing about how was your week

177
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,120
What did you do this week, Timmy?

178
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,640
Screwed cats, what?

179
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,000
I didn't do shit.

180
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What's that, Timmy? Timmy's caught in a whale?

181
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,840
What's that, Timmy?

182
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,800
Fuck it, I fucked it up!

183
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,200
What's that, Timmy's caught in your ass, what?

184
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,420
Gotcha.

185
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,100
Do anything fun this week, Jamie?

186
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,020
Went to a party, watched Battle Royale.

187
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,180
Yes, last night was the big party at Zero's house, and we watched Battle Royale.

188
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,340
You know, I still miss the beginning.

189
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,940
Every time I start to watch that movie, I either catch it in parts

190
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,180
because I have to go to the bathroom and do the whole thing,

191
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,860
or I miss the very beginning, and I miss the beginning again.

192
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,140
Was that a special edition or just the normal?

193
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,820
Because I need a special edition now because there's like a bunch of scenes

194
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,620
that they cut out.

195
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,660
Was this the song from the credits, this song that you had very first

196
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,460
pre-show night because somebody recognized it somebody in the chatroom

197
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,660
recognized it when it first played

198
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:08,020
very cool I had never I didn't even know what to expect when I saw that movie I

199
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,700
was just kind of sitting about it we didn't know I didn't even know anything

200
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,380
about it I didn't even drink last night so I was actually perfectly sober

201
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,100
watching the movie which you know at a party is actually pretty rarity for me

202
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,100
But I'm just kind of sitting there going, I don't know, everybody was arguing about what movie you want to watch.

203
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,100
Some people want to watch Battle Royale, some people want to watch, what was it called, The Swimmers?

204
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,100
The Water Boys.

205
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:30,100
Which I thought somebody said The Water Boy, and I'm like, I don't need to see a bad Adam Sandler movie again.

206
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:36,100
If you want to know more about Battle Royale, now the site does have a good bit of spoilers, but it's a very in-depth site, one of the best I found.

207
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:46,340
I found, go to battleroyalonline.com and it's actually R-O-Y-A-L-E.

208
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,340
You know what?

209
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:53,100
I was curious because in the background, you know, when training video, how they had www.br.com.

210
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,100
I'm wondering if that's...

211
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,100
I went to that site.

212
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,100
It wasn't there.

213
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,100
How about br.co.jp?

214
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,100
I didn't try that.

215
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,100
Try br.co.jp.

216
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,100
Oh, br.co.jp.

217
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Uh-huh.

218
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
Because there was not a br.com.

219
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,100
I looked.

220
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,100
I looked.

221
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,100
Probably not.

222
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,100
No.

223
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,100
But, um, nope.

224
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,100
But, um, try that site, battleroyalonline.com.

225
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,100
Okay.

226
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,100
Explain the premise of Battle Royale, because we're talking about this movie.

227
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,100
We haven't talked about what it's about, for those that don't know.

228
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:26,180
In the future, children do not respect their elders, and the world is thrown into chaos.

229
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:31,820
So they enact this thing called the Battle Royale Act, where they take a randomly-pooled

230
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:39,060
class of students, and put them in Iraq, and put them on a deserted island, and have them

231
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,260
kill each other until there's one left. And they have these little collars that make their

232
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,820
necks explode in cool, bloody ways. That was cool, but I liked that guy. It was a really

233
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:54,700
violent movie. Like, if you like young children and violence... I liked the guy that joined

234
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,380
up for fun. That guy kicked ass. Oh my God. Yeah, I liked the fact that... Right, Mexico

235
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,300
was the best one. I liked how the guy taught there in 8th grade. The slut was the coolest

236
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:09,940
person. I nominate for best student on the island for the males is going to go to the

237
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,100
guy that joined them for fun and then of course you know best female would be the slut, yeah.

238
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,740
I was going to say something profound about the movie I forgot. She got six kills. That

239
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:25,540
site that I just told you about, it has character profiles for like six of them and it actually

240
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:29,800
She has the cool slut girls profile, including her family history and everything.

241
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:39,800
She was a prostitute, and she was pimping out other girls, and she got six kills in

242
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,800
the movie.

243
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,320
It has her body, and actually this site is really cool because it has pictures of all

244
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,260
of the scorecards, so that's really cool.

245
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,260
You know what's interesting about that movie, what makes it a lot more fun?

246
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:56,340
If you imagine it being like 8th graders from your local Roosevelt Golf Land or your local

247
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,740
arcade that pisses you off, and then every time they run in front of that area between

248
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,900
the pad and the machine, that little necklace goes off and they explode.

249
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,100
Hey, I'd join up for fun to kill them.

250
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,020
Yeah, the best thing about that movie, it had the whole 90210 effect.

251
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,980
You have 8th graders that are like 30.

252
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,740
And you have your different types.

253
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,940
You have the slut, you have the prep.

254
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,860
Then you have the loner guy and you have the nerds.

255
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,860
The nerds were the best.

256
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,860
The nerds were so cool.

257
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,860
I want a pot lid to kill people with, because that would be so cool.

258
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,860
The pot lid saved him.

259
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,860
I know, that was the coolest part.

260
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,420
I still think Jack did the best and kicked ass.

261
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,420
Oh yeah.

262
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,860
You might want to talk about Battle Royale 2, because we're given the website for it

263
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,860
in the chat room right now by Jazz.

264
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,860
Actually, if you can get the link out of my live journal and post it in there.

265
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,860
Sure, actually Jazz just posted it in the chat room for our convenience.

266
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,340
Ah, thank you.

267
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:52,980
Battle Royale 2 is set after, of course, Battle Royale, about three years afterwards, with

268
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,660
the survivor, and actually the other, I don't want to go into detail, there's another character

269
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,340
who makes an important cameo, as far as I know.

270
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,100
On that side, though, there's a cool thing, they have scenes of their rehearsal.

271
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,100
I want to play with your pussy, ooh, ooh.

272
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,780
Jamie, please stop playing with Irene's pussy on the show, ooh, can I fish your pussy?

273
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,780
Yeah.

274
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,780
Oh, oh, oh.

275
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,780
Meow.

276
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,540
Pussy is here for those that are shocked and amazed right now.

277
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,780
Where did you get that from?

278
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,780
Hot Gothic.

279
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,660
A long time ago, like three years ago.

280
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,660
Oh man.

281
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,660
Yeah, I know.

282
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,660
It's so cute.

283
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,660
Yeah, and it's dead.

284
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,660
It's got X's for eyes, and it's got a pink tongue.

285
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,540
I have a panda for you at my house, by the way.

286
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,540
Oh, thank you.

287
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,380
It's got an opening where the pussy is, and it's pink inside.

288
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,380
Yeah.

289
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,380
The interior is pink.

290
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,380
It's really cool, or whatever.

291
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,220
That was a lovely image I'm sure, I'm sure our listeners are happy that we could share

292
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,220
that with all of you.

293
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,220
There's my cell phone.

294
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,220
Here, somebody talk.

295
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,140
Oh, I bet that's mine.

296
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,140
We're lost.

297
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,920
Hi.

298
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,140
So anyway, we need to fill a little more time here.

299
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,740
Let's look at this profile, this one chick.

300
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,660
I guess the chick that makes a cameo in the beginning of Battle Royale 1 has a full part

301
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,660
in the second movie.

302
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,660
That should be fun.

303
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,660
Oh, there they are.

304
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,660
Yes they are.

305
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:19,660
Oh, what the hell is this? There's some chick that looks like a Barbie doll that Chaz put in the chat room.

306
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,660
Yeah, it looks like Christina Aguilera.

307
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,660
That's scary. Anyway.

308
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,660
Alright, enough about Battle Royale. Somebody wants to take the mic. Hi.

309
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,660
You should have Dragon Ash in the next one.

310
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,660
So, how was your week, Logie? What did you do?

311
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:41,660
I worked on the website. Yes, I know there's nothing on there new right now.

312
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,660
If you trust me tomorrow, you're going to be seeing differently.

313
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:19,020
What will be coming up hopefully tomorrow, if I am able to zip everything up tonight,

314
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:26,860
would be all the official sets for DDR, everything from First through Xtreme, so everything that's

315
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,860
done so far.

316
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,940
I have a question for you, Loki, because I was able to play your sim last night, and

317
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,380
I actually got to play some songs.

318
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,220
Usually there's so many people there that I never get to actually play the damn sim,

319
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,220
I only get to watch it.

320
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,460
I got to play it last night.

321
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,720
Why are so many DWIs really badly synced, like the ones you get off the internet?

322
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,440
Why are they so bad, sync-wise?

323
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,900
Because people are stupid.

324
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,620
Well, how are those allowed to be distributed?

325
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,420
It's like, ugh, pisses me off.

326
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,220
Don't people check their files?

327
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,220
Nope.

328
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,220
God.

329
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:02,300
And a lot of times people just either make heavy steps or just make basic steps and really

330
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,020
annoying shit like that, so you have to go back and fix them.

331
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:14,020
So that's what I'm hoping to do also with releasing files on my site is it'll allow me to go in and check these files and be able to fix them.

332
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:24,020
Because, you know, obviously put them on the internet, I want to make sure that they're nice and fixed, they have nice backgrounds, you know, with the artist name in the banners and all that wonderful stuff.

333
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,020
So that's what I'll be working on.

334
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:31,020
And, you know, just to forewarn everyone because obviously I'm sure people will be noticing this.

335
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:35,020
All the sim files, you know, the official sets, are not created by me.

336
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,020
Yes, I know, shocker, I didn't have the time to create.

337
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,020
Thousands and thousands of sim files are already done and already synced.

338
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:48,020
So, you know, I'm just sticking them on my website in case some of these other websites go down or it's just another place to find them.

339
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,020
You know, bandwidth-wise or whatever.

340
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,020
Hi, welcome back.

341
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:59,020
But there will be some official stuff that will be exclusive to my site, such as the solo non-stops.

342
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:04,100
Those are going to be all done by me and those are not anywhere to be found on the internet.

343
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,100
Very cool.

344
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,100
Very cool.

345
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,100
That's about it.

346
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,700
But, if you're looking for DDR Extreme stuff and pretty much anything else right now, two

347
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,380
sites you can look at would be AmaniStyle.

348
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,540
They've got a lot of the stuff on there.

349
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,680
Or DDR UK.

350
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:23,620
They've just opened their download section again to everyone instead of just level two

351
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,340
members or whatever like that.

352
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:30,700
you can go download everything and you know I swear by Lawrence you know on the

353
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:37,100
website because he can just he sinks files better than anyone so but you know

354
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:43,660
I took his files and put the CD tags for the money so I just like their

355
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:48,700
tags better I don't know this is picky but they're all up there already will be

356
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,420
all up tomorrow as soon as I upload them and there's gonna be a change with how

357
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:57,120
you download them, it's going to be all through FTP now instead of just through the website

358
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:03,420
because one, it will allow me to update it faster and two, the FTPs on regulated as far

359
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:10,320
as bandwidth wise and the website, while normally you have unlimited bandwidth, they do watch

360
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,640
if your site uses a lot of bandwidth, they're going to close you down and unfortunately

361
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,560
my site is shared with stepmania.com and a bunch of other ones, so I don't want those

362
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,280
is going down, so I'm going to take measures to prevent that.

363
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,240
Very cool.

364
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,320
Question from the chat room, Brak2000 wants to know,

365
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,200
are you going to post announcer files?

366
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,240
No, actually, I could probably do that.

367
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,440
I have those.

368
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,080
Well, he wants them.

369
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,080
Well, maybe later this week.

370
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,680
All right.

371
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:47,480
If you want to join in the chat, just go to the website,

372
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,960
calibomani.com because we're part of the calibomani family

373
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,860

374
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,500
and you'll get another menu click on chat

375
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,100
it's that easy

376
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,640
you made a tower of pringles i'm so proud of you

377
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,000
another call

378
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,640
people turn your phones off

379
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,440
i'm kidding

380
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,800
was michael is mike here

381
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,080
yeah but he's not here

382
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,360
he got ice cream

383
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,340
did he get me

384
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,580
did he get me ice cream

385
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,400
know it no one else i didn't usually

386
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,040
i went and saw uh... dreamcatcher

387
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,080
was any good

388
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,880
all the file plan the sardis is

389
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,840
kick-ass

390
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,320
dreamcatcher well

391
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,440
three pictures a lot of part jokes

392
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,760
bad acting and uh...

393
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,200
a giant worm alien it speaks with the british accent

394
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,040
uh...

395
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,080
actual understand that at all

396
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,560
goodnight angel ray

397
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,680
he speaks to the british

398
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,800
but hilarious they've got one part in the movie because obviously all the

399
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,740
aliens look like these giant worm pigs

400
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,120
they make themselves look like you know the traditional looking alien

401
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,560
gray humanoid thing with the weird eyes

402
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,920
so basically there's one scene in the movie where they're going to destroy the alien ship

403
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,640
and you see all these aliens going

404
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,760
no don't hurt us

405
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,040
well it's like uh...

406
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,360
we're not infected don't hurt us we're not infected because there's this virus thing that's like

407
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,000
pretty much killing these people

408
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And so, um, but as they start getting close, because, you know, obviously the military knows better, they start turning into these worm things and running away.

409
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I just thought it was funny that they were, like, gunning down all these aliens and that was happening.

410
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Right.

411
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But, yeah. Dreamcatcher, um, it was decent. I wouldn't go see it again. And, well, actually, it actually kind of sucked ass.

412
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:45,000
But, next week, the core comes out, and that's who's going to really suck ass, so don't go see that one.

413
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Alright. Why don't we go to a quick break, I guess? Or is there any other Sim news you want to talk about, Logan? Things going on in the Sim world?

414
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:07,000
The last one they had was from the 6th, so it's a couple weeks old, but they're working on it.

415
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Not in Bumani's cells, no. If you're looking for like other sim files, stuff like, you know, for 2DX and that kind of thing, Bumani's cells got some, you know, they're really working on their Bumani, on their Bumani sim files, they've got like a lot of 2DX stuff on there and BeatMania 3 and whatnot.

416
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,040
So check them out for everything else, because they

417
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,760
will have one of the most complete sym file collections.

418
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,040
But DDR UK will probably have the best synced DDR DWIs.

419
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,120
So I don't know.

420
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,360
Then, of course, there's my site, which will have just a

421
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,640
lot of shit, a whole bunch of stuff on there.

422
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,780
So yeah.

423
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,560
All right, cool.

424
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,680
We're going to go to a break, and we'll be

425
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,040
back in a little bit.

426
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,320
We're going to do this break.

427
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,280
We'll do, I don't know, what song can we do?

428
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,280
Let's do something...

429
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,280
Wait, wait, wait!

430
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,280
I know!

431
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,280
We'll play my song.

432
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,280
Oh, scary.

433
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:08,280
Okay, we'll play something that Loki wants us to play.

434
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,280
Okay.

435
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,280
Here.

436
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,280
Da-da-da-da.

437
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,800
What are we loading up here, Loki?

438
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:18,560
We're loading up a really cool remix I just found on Monty Sims a while ago.

439
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,920
Oh, that was cool!

440
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920
Okay, we'll play that.

441
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,160
We're going to play the absolute happy mix.

442
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:29,380
And then, I have a request for Calcutta, and a request for Guacamole Del Taco, I'll get

443
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,700
all those in this break, and we'll be back.

444
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,760
And we're gonna do the FUs of the week when we come back, so send those over to me by

445
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,800
private message in the chatroom, but we'll also talk about some Amani news, we have that

446
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
too.

447
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
So, we'll be back!

448
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:47,800
Thanks for listening to Orange Lawns Radio.

449
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:39,800
One day when I got some weed, I told them who to help, I got some weed.

450
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,800
I like to be shit and fat and be hooliching cause I'm fat now

451
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Uncle Dandie, he is rich, he's a sexy fat man

452
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,800
And I know that he will help me as much as he can

453
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,800
A sexy fat man is what I want to be

454
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,800
But you're all over him but you want to ride with me

455
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,800
I don't know why it's okay that I'm on my body

456
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,800
But every speed in Calcutta is a fight

457
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Calcutta, I am a sexy starboy

458
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,200
That's my life, I'm a little sexy

459

I'm a little sexy, sexy, sexy

I love to fly the kashy

462
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,000
I like it very much

463
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,500
Even though I have no license, I always panic, but

464
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,000
I can find me at my end, I can find me at my feet

465
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And I have no problem getting very ugly

466
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,500

Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

477
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:02,540
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

478
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:08,420
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

479
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,420
Hello.

480
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,420
That woman is scary.

481
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,420
I saw her.

482
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,420
Who's scary?

483
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,420
The ganguro.

484
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,420
Okay.

485
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,180
Oh, the two we were just looking at from Battle Royale 2?

486
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:16,680
Yeah.

487
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,180
Oh, OK.

488
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,180
No, shoot that picture.

489
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:18,680
Go back.

490
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,180
All right.

491
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:19,680
Show her.

492
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,180
Here we go.

493
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:20,680
She is scary.

494
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,180
She's going to be in Battle Royale 2.

495
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,260
She looks like Christina Aguilera.

496
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:30,260
She's what she's referred to as ganguro.

497
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,920
You know, the super tan, the uber blonde, and the panda makeup.

498
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,420
Ah.

499
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:41,260
Which, from what I understand, are now a dying breed.

500
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:41,940
So.

501
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,940
I've got a long time to go home.

502
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,940
We've got that to throw at Rob.

503
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,940
Say hello, we've got some new guests in the house.

504
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,940
Say hello to Asian Innovation.

505
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,940
Word up fo' shizzle, my gizzle.

506
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,940
How you doin'?

507
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,940
Doin' alright.

508
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,940
Could you possibly be here to promote anything tonight?

509
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,940
Is my microphone on? Yeah, I think it is.

510
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,940
Yeah, it is on.

511
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:12,940
Alright, because if yours is off, then this one's off too, and that would be bad.

512
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,940
Okay, so I'll turn it off.

513
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,940
That's right.

514
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,940
Are you here to promote anything tonight, by chance?

515
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,940
Yeah, I'm here to promote Orange Lounge.

516
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,940
Woo!

517
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,940
Definitely.

518
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:33,940
We're sponsored by Pringles Original, Potato Chris.

519
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:47,300
For you who speak Spanish, papitas cuyen tes, and three flavors, original sour cumin onion

520
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:52,540
and cheese-ums, not to confuse with Cheez-Its.

521
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:59,660
Also we are also sponsored by Kelby, shrimp flavored chips, remember they're always baked,

522
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,660
not fried.

523
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,380
They taste like Long John Silver, I don't like them.

524
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:07,900
I don't know why they're, we're sponsored by them, but we're sponsored by Propel, which

525
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,780
is, yeah.

526
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,980
We're also sponsored by Triple Black.

527
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:20,040
By Triple Black, Smirnoff Ice, which I'm going to get about ten of those later.

528
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,040
And the guacamole chips!

529
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,540
I don't even have to tell the brand, because you know how good it is.

530
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:28,500
Alright, on to the real topics.

531
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,020
Next week, there's going to be a tournament.

532
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,020
No.

533
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:35,020
Yeah, there isn't. It's off. It's cancelled. Sorry.

534
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,020
Haha, fooled you.

535
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,020
Not really. I'm serious. We're not having a tournament...

536
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:45,020
Oh, wait. I was thinking about the home run derby. My bad.

537
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,020
Do that again.

538
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,020
That's pretty kinky.

539
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,020
Also, we have another special guest in the house.

540
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,020
Many of you guys maybe have heard him before.

541
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,020
Give it up for...

542
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:10,020
This is Dchild, the dark child in the heezy pacheezy.

543
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:14,020
Otherwise known as MGL player number three.

544
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,020
Yes, he's been around longer since...

545
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:22,020
Since any of you guys were fucking playing this game.

546
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,020
Yeah, he's been around since 1910 and um...

547
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,020
I think in those days I was probably going,

548
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:31,520
What's this DDR crap? I'll play Busta Move.

549
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:37,020
Yeah, I'll remind you, he's been playing since DDR used to cost $18,000 a machine.

550
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,020
It's been that long.

551
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:43,520
But back on topic, yeah, it costs $18,000 a play.

552
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,520
Are you here promoting anything tonight? Teach out.

553
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:54,020
I'm promoting that right now I'm still most of the way single, so yeah, I'm promoting myself.

554
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,020
Most of the way? Who's got your other part?

555
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,020
Got your back cover?

556
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,020
Her name's Susie, but there's nothing official yet, so I don't know.

557
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,020
I think I still see you go.

558
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,020
So if you want to come on down to March Madness.

559
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,020
Yeah.

560
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:12,020
All right, there's a tournament coming up, March Madness.

561
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:17,020
If any of you watch NCAA college basketball, you already know the format.

562
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,020
If not, let me break it down for you.

563
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:24,020
It's like the WWF, 64, Hell in a Cell match.

564
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,020
No, not really.

565
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:29,100
This is going to be 64 people all in bracketed play.

566
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,780
And

567
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,420
basically you screw off head to head against each other. You will be seated

568
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,140
like the NCAA tournament.

569
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:40,660
So basically if you're from SoCal or NorCal or any other state

570
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,220
we're going to try to keep you guys separate from one another.

571
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,060
We're basically going to take your abilities

572
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:50,700
and we're going to rank you accordingly.

573
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,120
And every match will be one song only

574
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,340
and the person with more perfects will advance to the next round

575
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:00,600
and the winner must win six grueling matches

576
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:05,220
because i will make it especially tough for you

577
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,880
as a hint i guess i'll

578
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,200
there's sixty four matches i will tell you one song in the tournament you guys should

579
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,420
practice

580
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,680
practice bag

581
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,540
haha

582
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:21,880
no i hate that song

583
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,340
i'm being told about freestyle well we'll talk about freestyle

584
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:28,060
yeah ourselves

585
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:31,620
yeah uh... i'm also taking freestyle to new level i want to get some uh...

586
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,080
reality dvd are going

587
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,780
so we're basing it off american idol with the idol

588
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:42,380
uh... i have a releases yet but i will tell you guys the judges now since we're

589
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,540
only one week away ok let's hear it

590
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,900
of course you guys almost simon paula and randy

591
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,200
our versions of simon pollard mandy

592
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,960
i'll start with

593
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,460
randy

594
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,920
he is

595
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,060
someone that has your credentials

596
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:04,400
he's someone that has won tournaments and he's someone that uses dog in every

597
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,260
sentence

598
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,800
we can't go wrong it's melby

599
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,880
all yes lately i think i think we we might have a little clip of melby here

600
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,040
somewhere

601
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,360
by this will be a part of the area

602
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:22,560
That's right! That's right!

603
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,300
Alright, on to Paula. Some of you might know her, some of you might not.

604
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,960
She's a SoCal DDR player. I know Paula Abdul.

605
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:35,500
Yeah. She also goes by the handle

606
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,980
She also goes by the handle GoodAttackGirl. Her name is Angela.

607
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,940
Is she sweet?

608
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,400
Yeah, she is.

609
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,540
That's awesome.

610
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:47,780
She'll try to keep Simon in check.

611
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:52,240
Alright, many of you have been wondering, who is Simon gonna be?

612
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:58,140
Well, many people have wanted to be Simon, including our own Loki, kept begging. We got people in the chatroom begging.

613
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:01,580
But it's already been sealed, right? The deal's been sealed a long time ago, right?

614
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:08,280
Yes. You signed a deal with the devil. Basically, before the tournament even started, I secured my Simon.

615
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,840
Because if I would have gotten this person a Simon, I think this tournament would have been on hold.

616
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:18,100
This is someone that won't be afraid to tell you to your face that you suck shit.

617
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:23,840
He'll tell you to your face that he'll never want to see you on the DDR platform ever again.

618
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:28,220
This person will also tell you, you know,

619
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,860
not to ever put a quarter in the machine.

620
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:33,020
He'll tell you that you're ugly.

621
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,360
He'll tell you that your routine was ugly.

622
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,540
He'll tell you you can't dance.

623
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:41,300
He'll tell you you're the worst dancer in America.

624
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:45,020
He won't even tell you he might be the worst DDR player in the world

625
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:48,400
or even the universe.

626
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,240
But I don't think I'll tell you guys, because I want to keep the suspense for a week.

627
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,780
Oh, come on. Just a hint?

628
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:58,940
Okay, I think you guys should know. Alright, yeah, yeah, tell us.

629
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,060
He's none other than...

630
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:05,280
Josh, failure, be afraid.

631
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,780
Be very afraid.

632
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,260
uh... that will be fun

633
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:15,660
had your egos

634
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,900
all right so um...

635
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,460
that should be interesting something a good group of judges now

636
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,780
are you going to be announcing america hours that wait till the

637
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,500
next week

638
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,560
uh... so we don't

639
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,500
give away everything we're not going to have america announced

640
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,600
sounds fair

641
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,780
and also arm just so you know ryan seacrest uh... we're gonna have to

642
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,180
co-hosts

643
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,580
So you got Dunkleman back?

644
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:44,100
We're going to have co-hosts, so it's going to be fun.

645
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,020
Definitely fun.

646
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:50,340
You going to talk about who that is, or is that a surprise to you?

647
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,620
I think it's better if you find out next week.

648
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,020
Many surprises.

649
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,060
Yeah, you have to come to figure it out. Or if you're too far away, like if you're on the east

650
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,620
coast and something can't make it out here,

651
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:04,180
you have to tune in live, because we'll be broadcasting it live, and you'll find all that out, because we'll tell you.

652
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:07,980
I think all those people on the East Coast should just, you know, bite the bullet and get a plane ticket.

653
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:15,180
Ride the Amtrak, use a Greyhound, hitchhike, sell yourself to be at this tournament.

654
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:21,080
And don't worry, Sacramento doesn't really have any large skyscrapers, so you're still good.

655
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,880
Folsom has a dam.

656
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,980
What about nuclear power plants?

657
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,780
Uh, they shut down Rancho Sego years ago, right?

658
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,780
What about all the Air Force bases we have here?

659
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,780
Shh!

660
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,780
They all keep getting bought out and privatized.

661
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,780
Yeah.

662
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,780
Alright, so, are there any other things about March Madness we gotta talk about?

663
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,780
Oh my god, oh my god, we should bomb RBGL.

664
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,780
Yeah, that's the only thing you have to worry about.

665
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,780
I second that notion.

666
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:56,780
But, I will have to say, this is one of the tournaments that you actually want to participate in,

667
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:04,660
in because last year was so much fun I mean going through the 64 people and 32

668
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:09,980
matches who really gives a shit about the 7-10 matchup right so it ended up being

669
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:14,880
one of the most exciting matches in the first round hyperbroken versus liquid

670
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,940
blue it's a it's just a little blast from the past but uh what happened was

671
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:25,180
hyperbroken was the number 10 seed liquid blue was the seventh seed and

672
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:31,360
And Liquid Blue was lucky enough to get his song, La Señorita, but Hyperbroken won by

673
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:38,100
one great and everyone in the building was chanting, upset, upset.

674
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:43,380
And who could forget Chubz taking out the number one Inuan.

675
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:47,020
I think this year there's going to be much more upsets.

676
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:50,900
The way it's structured, one win all the way throughout so nothing is guaranteed.

677
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,900
You can get your song and run the table.

678
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,900
Anyways, you want to say anything? Darkshot?

679
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,020
I'm wondering if we're going to have our great white ninja.

680
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:10,260
I don't know. The great white ninja's in Wisconsin right now. It's kind of hard to get a ninja, you know, magically appear here.

681
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:18,180
Well, I have been asked to let it be known to the Asian innovation that the Caucasian innovation, 23rd Magus,

682
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:24,500
will do a max unlimited routine, a DDR idol.

683
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:29,380
Be prepared to have your statements on video tape.

684
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,660
Let it be known.

685
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:37,380
Alright, by the way, we will be producing a DVD eventually with this tournament, so

686
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:44,380
if you guys miss it, you will be able to relive all the moments again with commentary.

687
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:48,380
I'm on DVD. I'm on DVD. Sweet.

688
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:52,380
Trust me, this'll be just like Jackass.

689
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:56,380
Hey, could my double-trick paranoia routine be a special feature?

690
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:00,380
Yeah, baby, yeah.

691
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:04,380
This is how Dick Vitale does it. Yeah, baby, yeah!

692
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:08,380
Maybe we should get the bats.

693
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:12,380
Yeah, maybe Jamie and I will do a reprise of our Miggle II routine. That'll be fun.

694
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:19,380
and

695
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:23,700
we're trying to give a little side thing we do like the bake sale was a big hit

696
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,260
it's after trying to get a sighted Twinkies

697
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,020
and we're thinking it's which

698
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,940
we're just gonna sell fried Twinkies the hell with everything else to be a fried

699
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,380
Twinkie sale I don't know no I don't even know if that's gonna happen we'll

700
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,220
see

701
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:39,180
we're trying to figure out something cute that we drive Twinkies

702
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:46,220
One very cool thing that's going to be run on the side of March Madness is a 2DX tournament.

703
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:51,520
I believe, am I not correct, this is NorCal's first big 2DX tournament, correct?

704
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,520
I think so, yeah.

705
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,120
I think so.

706
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:58,440
So the very first 2DX tournament will be this weekend.

707
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,440
And guess what?

708
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,200
We're going to announce the qualifying songs here live, but we'll do that after the FUs.

709
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,400
You want to do it right now?

710
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,400
Right now?

711
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,040
Alright, let's talk about it.

712
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:15,240
Now, what's funny about this, only like four people in the whole world know about the 2DX

713
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,480
qualifiers right now.

714
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,240
Mike doesn't even know.

715
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:23,080
It's his dang tournament, the March Madness, but he doesn't know.

716
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,920
But you're going to be competing in 2DX, right?

717
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,920
Yes, I will.

718
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,440
All right, so it would be good to get some reactions from some contestants here live

719
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,440
on air.

720
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,720
So let's talk about what those qualifiers are going to be.

721
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,000
All right, here we go.

722
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,160
I gotta bring them up, so fill time.

723
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,120
Tell us more about how the 2DX tournament will work, Jamie.

724
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,000
You hit the keys,

725
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,240
and turn the slidey thing,

726
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,940
and you make a song.

727
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,440
That's how 2DX works.

728
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,040
Really, the way it's going to work is qualifiers are going to have two songs

729
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,720
that they have to play, higher score moves on, basically.

730
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,440
And the rest of it's going to go like that. However, for anyone who went to Shaft,

731
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,240
the rest of the tournament is going to work very much like Shaft worked, where we have the

732
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,800
categories with the songs.

733
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,240
and the categories by the way

734
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,560
in our minds they're associated with the songs they may not necessarily be that

735
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,840
way in your mind

736
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,000
uh... and uh...

737
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,200
it's going to be challenging

738
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,400
we can put it that way it's going to be challenging

739
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,340
but it's uh... it'll be it'll be a fun tournament and

740
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:24,660
i don't think anyone's going to walk away from that being

741
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,620
really unsatisfied

742
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:29,720
unless you start qualifying to be another

743
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:34,100
we're not going to get that

744
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:38,100
It might get harder though in the later rounds. Definitely would get harder in the later rounds.

745
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,100
But we're not going to say anything about that.

746
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,100
What about squeezing crotch?

747
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:52,100
Dude, this ferret, these noises he's making. You have to squeeze his crotch to make these noises.

748
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,100
I'd be making noises if someone squeezed my crotch.

749
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,100
Last week on Orange Lounge.

750
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,100
We don't do those anymore, you know?

751
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,100
I got lazy, so I stopped doing those flashback clicks.

752
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:09,100
And yes, we will be announcing qualifiers here in just a second. I'm just queuing some stuff up.

753
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:13,100
I'll do them when we get in our new place. I'll make them evil.

754
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,100
And we're sponsored by Pringles.

755
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:19,100
I'm sponsored by Propel and the letter Z.

756
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:23,100
I thought that was what they said about sex.

757
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:28,100
Once you pop it. Yeah, you don't stop it.

758
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:31,100
Too bad these Pringles taste like shit.

759
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:35,220
Yeah, actually sex tastes like shit too depending on what kind you do

760
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,100
Dude, I don't know who you're having sex with it should it taste like that

761
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,500
well depends on how you

762
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:49,660
Wrong end

763
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:53,140
That was a cartoon too

764
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:58,140
We have an unpaid sponsor now www.rotten.com

765
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:06,140
www.styleproject.com

766
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:33,140
Followed by, oh I should say deadline 7 key, followed by the safari light 7.

767
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:47,140
Alright that's the first pair, deadline and safari light 7. The second pair that you can pick from is air flow 7 key.

768
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,140
That song sucks.

769
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:54,300
Sorry, I pulled these really quickly.

770
00:52:54,300 --> 00:53:00,340
And the partner song to that is Kotei wo Muteo from 6th- I'm sorry, Kotei wo Muteo from 6th

771
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,340
Style.

772
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:08,900
Okay, I know I'm not going to be picking that pair.

773
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:13,140
Third pair that you can pick from, this is the third pair, is Cheer Train.

774
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,140
The hell is Cheer Train?

775
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:23,400
Okay, and that's partnered with Abyss

776
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:35,340
And the third pair is Indigo Vision

777
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:57,900
one. And that's partnered with Spooky. The last pair is Alien World. Well, that's an

778
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:04,900
It's an easy one, but it's partnered with Rizlim.

779
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,760
So there they are.

780
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,780
Those are the qualifying songs for the 2DX tournament.

781
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,140
What the fuck is Cheer Train?

782
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,420
You want to hear Cheer Train one more time?

783
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,220
Was that a side quest of Final Fantasy VIII?

784
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:23,100
No, it's from 7th Style.

785
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:27,140
I'll play some of those during the breaks so you can get refreshed with those songs.

786
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:31,540
Yes, songs were kind of picked on purpose, half songs people play and half people don't

787
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:36,380
play. Let me run down those one more time. These are the pairs you can pick from to qualify

788
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:40,940
with for the 2DX Tournament of March Madness. First pair are Deadline, Seven Key, and Safari,

789
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:45,940
Light Seven. Second pair is Airflow, and pronounce that for me because I'm too white.

790
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,940
Where?

791
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,940
Uh...

792
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,940
Thank you very much.

793
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:32,940
p0k3smot42o I can pass half of those songs and the other half I can't pass

794
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,940
p0k3smot42o Which one is the one with your train?

795
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:35,940
p0k3smot42o Abyss

796
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,940
p0k3smot42o I failed Abyss with a vengeance today, I got a 12 on it

797
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:46,940
Okay, so, hooray for that.

798
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:51,180
As promised, during this segment we would get to the FUs of the Week, so if we're done

799
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:54,740
talking about March Madness now, you guys done?

800
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:58,940
Is there anything else we need to say about March Madness?

801
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:06,520
Okay well let's do the FUs of the Week, and you know, since Asian Innovation and Dark

802
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:09,280
Your child has never been here for the Effie's of the Week, Jamie, why don't you explain

803
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,560
to them how it works?

804
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,520
Busy opening my propel, fuck you.

805
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:16,520
Um, oh wait, um, that is exactly it.

806
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,680
Fuck yous of the week are where you talk about shit you're pissed off about.

807
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,360
That's it.

808
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:25,680
Anything that you want to give a fuck you to, just tell them right now on the air.

809
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,000
They may not be listening, but oh well, it feels better to get it out.

810
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,440
I fucking hate the fucking gas prices fucking going on fucking right now.

811
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,440
You gotta wait your turn.

812
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,440
You gotta wait your turn.

813
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,440
Fuck!

814
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:49,000
So, with that being said, let's get started, shall we, Jamie?

815
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
This is fucked up.

816
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,440
My first lecture of the week goes for being unemployed, but also being unemployed is a

817
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,080
good thing because my life is much more enjoyable since I can go wake up at two in the afternoon

818
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:06,360
and go to Scandinavia, play 2DX for three hours, and then go back home and sleep.

819
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:10,360
My car is still not being tuned up, although they're doing everything they can.

820
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,360
I'm being patient about it.

821
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:17,360
But, um, it's been a while, okay? It's just been a while.

822
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,360
Um, also it goes toward people who can't drive.

823
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:25,360
And it goes toward, um, the particular exit from the Boston Market parking lot.

824
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,360
So you can see the light.

825
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,360
And for the woman who looked like a troll.

826
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,360
You remember her?

827
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,360
Oh yeah, she looked kind of funny.

828
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,360
The woman in the white car who...

829
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,360
I seriously thought...

830
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,360
You've seen that movie Troll, right?

831
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,360
She looked like Troll.

832
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,360
Except she was not great.

833
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,360
She was going to live under a bridge.

834
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,360
Yeah, she was driving through a bridge.

835
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:52,360
And then my other Bucky goes toward...

836
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:56,360
Toward not being able to get anything else to say about you two.

837
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:00,360
I wasn't going to say it.

838
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:07,360
Hire me! Thank you.

839
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:16,840
There's a big huge, like, knot in the cord here. I mean, we're talking, like, massive knot here.

840
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,920
That's a f*** you. That is a big huge knot.

841
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:25,560
If you didn't rob for keeping his cords all knotted. Of course, I can't really say much about that because you should see it on my computer.

842
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,000
It's like a giant, massive cord.

843
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,960
anyways uh...

844
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,700
and i had only a

845
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:36,840
at the mcdonald's for putting their breaking uh... condiments and everything

846
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,100
under the cheese

847
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,720
i was sure i don't like people that i thought you know

848
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:41,820
cheeseburgers

849
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:45,040
if i never asked for him to take off because i think that the time in their

850
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,140
slow as it is

851
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,360
so this dumb bitch with it

852
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,260
fucking people underneath

853
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:53,720
where you can i get at people's because they're under the season melted over

854
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:54,600
enough

855
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,500
So, it pissed me off because I was biting into the hamburger, and at first I looked at it and go,

856
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,100
Oh look, no pickles on this!

857
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:04,200
And they didn't put any condiments. I bite into it, taste pickle, and get pissed.

858
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,800
So, you're so stupid, you can't even- you fucked up a burger!

859
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,500
How easy is that?

860
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,000
Fucking a bur-

861
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Put the shit together!

862
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,300
You're fucking a burger?

863
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,800
They're fucking a burger!

864
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,700
They're fucking up a burger!

865
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,000
Well, that explains a lot.

866
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,200
What the hell?

867
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:30,200
You were complaining, I fixed it.

868
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,240
Fuck you two, uh, microphones are already low.

869
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:44,480
Your remix, uh, Darksacker, that's not coming along because it's just, I don't know, not good.

870
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:51,480
I feed him aim for having a headache. I don't know what's coming from. I don't know.

871
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:55,880
damn you know it sucks because i was really angsty earlier this morning but then after

872
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:00,280
hearing that miyazaki's uh screwed away one i just kind of forgot about everything

873
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:08,600
uh i guess we could just cover the regular stuff gas print oh oh oh this is this is a major one

874
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:14,040
fb did a stupid war in cnn for cutting in on my favorite favorite stations i don't give a

875
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:19,880
fuck about watching an explosion that happened six hours ago numerous times all day long look

876
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:23,240
it's bombing look there's bombing going on no shit what do you think they're

877
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:27,080
doing over there having a rave having a party is everyone getting along i don't

878
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,360
care about your fucking bombing and seeing the little explosion if i wanted

01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:35,640
to see explosions i'd watch fireworks you know it's stupid and i don't give a

880
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:39,080
crap about half the stuff they have on there yahoo news now there's like the

882
01:00:43,800 --> 01:01:03,800
I can't read any of it. It's like, uhhh, soldiers, something, something. It's annoying. I just really wish. If I wanted to watch 24 hour news, I'd tune in to CNN. I don't want CNN on another station because I'm trying to watch, you know, some other show like American Idol or something like that.

883
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:31,080
p0k3smot42o

884
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:34,760
That sucks.

885
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:35,760

I'm feeling old.

889
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,120
I wasn't even drunk.

890
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,320
There's no excuse for that.

891
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,720
And F you to Anita.

892
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,720
Wink wink nudge nudge.

893
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,720
Just like I did at faces, baby.

894
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:54,200
Okay, I'm older than you, and if you feel older than me, then you suck.

895
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,200
F that.

896
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,000
Alright, moving on.

897
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Let's go around the room.

898
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Who wants to start?

899
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,520
there was zero

900
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,440
my baby's mama

901
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,000
i'm not even saying anything

902
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,400
but about

903
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,200
watching fireworks bombs are really really big fireworks

904
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,320
that blow up people's houses and buildings

905
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,480
but i didn't see any bodies flying in the air nothing happening there

906
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,560
like earlier today they just had a picture of the night sky there

907
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,760
no no hold on hold on

908
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:27,320
hear that in the distance there's bombing going on

909
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:34,120
where we can't see it! But we're still showing the goddamn city! Who cares? Turn it off!

910
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:37,420
Do some other news! I'm sure there's something else happening in the world other than the

911
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:41,420
stupid bombing. You know, everything's stopped. Just for the bombing.

912
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:47,920
No, but I gotta, like, the only thing I really like about watching those is when they make

913
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,840
you listen to all the gunfire and all the stuff, you know somebody's dying somewhere,

914
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:55,920
or someone just got blown up, and that's the coolest part about the world.

915
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:01,360
news showed the caravan and then they showed camels and goats following following the tanks

916
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:07,280
yeah after some stupid fucking guy says yeah we see camels out here and they're very distressed

917
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:13,440
it's like whatever but anyways back to my fus one i have an fu two well kind of war related

918
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:20,720
there's a stupid guy in the uk and i know he's listening stop sending me fucking yeah or ims

919
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:27,500
over MSN messenger telling me to go on busy for 15 minutes to like grieve the 15 UK soldiers

920
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:34,500
who died. I'm not going to go on a 15 minute busy every damn 15 fucking minutes. You know,

921
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:40,280
you might be an absolute sort of stupid loser and who the hell cares. Get a life and get

922
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:47,280
off the internet and go do something. Oh my god. Say that again. Well because Dreamcatcher

923
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:52,280
Well, because Dreamcatcher told me that British people are aliens anyways.

924
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:57,280
Giant worm aliens. They're shit weasels. They fly out of your ass.

925
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,280
Like Sam Cassell.

926
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,280
Yeah.

927
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:08,280
My other F.U. is to my computer. I just got a new webcam, and it'll install it, and then give me a fucking warning every damn time I try to open a stupid program.

928
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:11,280
Give me your webcam. You can have mine.

929
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,280
If it works, I mean, mine's just stupid.

930
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:31,280
Yeah, okay, well I might have to re-install the whole thing, but anyways, um, another F.U. is to like, the friggin', whatchya call it, like, not having money sucks, but I got money yesterday though, so I'm okay with that.

931
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:40,280
Um, an F.U. is to the stupid bastard who decided it'd be a good idea to take off the damn yard sale signs at my mom's yard sale, so I had to go and fucking put up all ten of them again.

932
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:44,280
And if I ever see you again, because I know who you are, I swear to God I will kill you.

933
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:53,280
Another F.U. is to the stupid shrimp chips, because they're too addicting and they make me sick. What?

934
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:56,280
Sponsored by Kelby.

935
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:01,280
That's all I really got right now. Oh yeah, stupid.

936
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:08,280
Fuck you to the stupid Road to Perdition getting the best cinematog- just winning for cinematography.

937
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:15,280
It should have gone to the games of New York because they actually did really well and that's all I got to say, Sanda.

938
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,280
Why? One last thing, you are cool.

939
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:28,280
Alright, first off, I want to give some fuck yous out to everyone that is listening. Thank you very, very much.

940
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:35,280
Alright, the next fuck you goes out to the tomahawk missiles, the cruise missiles, and the patriot missiles.

941
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:41,440
Each missile costs us about one to two million each. We're launching billions of missiles on the air atmosphere

942
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:46,080
You know all that money that we've been spending on these fucking missiles could be going to the Somalians

943
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:50,960
So we can be feeding the Somalians give them the food and building future terrorists, you know

944
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:54,240
So what I think we're killing two birds in one store right now, aren't we?

945
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,760
alright

946
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:01,960
Yeah, yeah my next fuck you goes out to Windows XP

947
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:15,960
Today, I was trying to install a pirated copy of Windows XP, but I tried to get a Windows update, and it won't let me because it was pirated.

948
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,960
What the fuck? Why would I even?

949
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:20,960
I got a corporate version for you if you want it.

950
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:27,960
Alright, uh, fuck you to Professional Windows XP. Amen to the corporate versions.

951
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:42,960
Alright, fuck, okay, my next fuck you goes out to all these people on the freeway to that speed that don't know how to drive.

952
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:48,320
Cuz on my way to Sacramento today, I was stuck in traffic. No, not because traffic was slow

953
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:51,840
But because some idiots decided to get into a car accident

954
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:56,880
Yes, they did decide to get into it cuz they were driving probably 150 miles an hour in a 70 zone

955
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:00,520
But it's alright cuz they're on stretchers now and they're feeling the pain

956
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,400
Intense, don't be stupid

957
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:09,560
Let me see, what is my next fuck you go to? I had it a second ago. Oh come back to me

958
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,960
I'll pass it on until I get it back

959
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:17,560
I'm gonna use this mic cuz it's a bit better I got a lot of fuck yous first

960
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:23,780
off fuck you to all your stupid high horse prissy little DDR players that

01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:27,000

962
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,820

963
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:35,200
was playing you have no idea who the hell I am I'm coming after you fools

964
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:41,940
next big fuck you I'm gonna get a lot of shit for this fuck you President Bush

965
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:48,940
Bush. Fuck you and this goddamn war. Spending $400 billion on this goddamn war. $161 billion

966
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:58,340
would solve all the problems with our education system. Fuck you, Bush. Or free the Somalians.

967
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:04,940
Another big fuck you involved in the war. Fuck you, American media, and all your goddamn

968
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:11,940
We're the media. We're indie, not American press. Indie press is cool. I ain't got nothing

969
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:16,940
against them. Let's see, what other big fuck yous?

970
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:21,460
Yeah, media needs to just stop telling us that they know shit, but then say, oh, but

971
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:27,900
we don't know that for sure. Whatever happened to that shuttle crash that,

972
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:32,980
I don't know, took place a while back and then all of a sudden, oh, hey, war!

973
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:39,980
What ever happened to, uh, what was that guy's name again? Um, what was it? Osama Bin Laden.

974
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:44,980
Where's he? But anyways, another big fuck you. Gas prices.

975
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:48,980
What about stories about how ugly Rosie O'Donnell is? Why don't I see those anymore?

976
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:50,980
Because the lesbians gave up on that one.

977
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:54,980
And did Michael Jackson just stop molesting kids all of a sudden, you know? Huh?

978
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:59,980
And, uh, we've tried so hard to get Rosie O'Donnell out of her mind, so yeah.

979
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:07,980
You know what's funny about this whole thing? They're never going to catch Sadam. He's just going to slip through again, and we're going to have this all in like another ten years, all over again.

980
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:10,980
I think that he exists in a virtual reality.

981
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:15,980
Osama bin Laden's hand is up Sadam's ass, that's where he is.

982
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:19,980
Sadam's been dead for twenty years, how many of you guys know that? He's been using one of those doubles.

983
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:23,980
But he has a live journal.

984
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:32,980
So there's one post, because there's one computer that's actually connected to the internet.

985
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:37,980
Good job!

986
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:42,980
Okay, another fuck you. I don't remember your name. I don't remember what you look at.

987
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:49,980
It was at Asian Innovations' birthday party. You showed up uninvited, but with Hyperbroken.

988
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:52,980
You're not beef against HyperBroken. HyperBroken, you're cool, alright?

989
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:58,980
But this motherfucker, tall ass, lanky white dude, he's about six foot three, you might know who he is.

990
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:00,980
Oh shit, it's Brad.

991
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:03,980
I only know his call name, I'm sorry.

992
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:08,980
But this motherfucker, alright, I send money out with HyperBroken to pick up some drinks.

993
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:14,980
That does not mean this motherfucker can then go and spend some of my goddamn money on his own personal drink.

994
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:17,580
That's what tall, lanky-ass white boy did.

995
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:23,280
If you know who he is, let me know. I want to find his ass. He still owes me two bucks.

996
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,380
Mother fuck you.

997
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:32,880
Fuck you to the people who are unemployed and can go to bed and stay asleep till two in the goddamn afternoon.

998
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,780
I envy all you guys, so fuck you.

999
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:39,480
But I want to have a job, because I need money.

1000
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,180
I'm not getting unemployment.

1001
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:42,780
Oh, that sucks.

1002
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:47,280
I could, but I'm not, because my man makes enough to support us both, which is enough.

1003
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,280
But...

1004
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:52,280
Hey, tell someone to hire me!

1005
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,280
Alright.

1006
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,780
Chat room is demanding we get to their FUs, so here we go.

1007
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:58,780
Fuck you!

1008
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:02,780
Fuck the chat room FUs for breaking up my fuck you.

1009
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:05,780
Oh, were you done? Did you have anything else you wanted to add?

1010
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:09,280
Fuck you to crazy ass women giving us double signals.

1011
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:13,660
One minute they hot what bit if they cold you don't know what the fuck is going on

1012
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,800
At 22

1013
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,300
Exactly all right

1014
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:24,980
I got a fuck you to Sacramento because

1015
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:30,480
Because I cannot find a pink anywhere when you need money you cannot find a pink anywhere on the road

1016
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,480
Who do you think at Wells Fargo?

1017
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:38,140
Jesus go to any store go to this. There's a safe way up the street. They have their 24 hours. They have Wells Fargo

1018
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:45,140
Okay, based on my last fuck you about women, I'm sorry Susie, if you're listening somehow, I didn't mean it.

1019
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:12,140
poppin' into the chatroom right when Angel leaves, FU to not having a routine for Mt. Mikes

1020
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:14,140
er, Mt. Mikes, March Madness

1021
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:18,140
I keep thinking M.M. means Mt. Mikes

1022
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:31,140
FU to having two essays due tomorrow and not having started, oh my god what the fuck

1023
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:38,140
DarkTartuya says, F U 2 being single still. Someone date me dammit!

1024
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,120
I think that's it. Are you a male or a female?

1025
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,940
Male. Oh, never mind.

1026
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:48,680
Arkadian42 says, F U 2 my body for being in bad shape this week. I started out with a

1027
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:54,160
sore throat, then developed into a cold, then went away, then came back. Also, my left foot

1028
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:57,820
hurt at the beginning of the week, and then stopped hurting, and now my right foot hurts.

1029
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:01,480
It also kept me from getting anything accomplished this week, since I didn't want to go out at all.

1030
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:08,320
Fuck you to tailgaters who can't see that you can't move up any farther in traffic. Fucking idiots.

1031
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,720
That reminds me of a fuck you.

1032
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,840
Fuck you, goddamn pneumonia.

1033
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:18,480
Once you get rid of a cold, this motherfucker kicks in, and it doesn't go away.

1034
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:21,940
Fuck you to bad Chinese immigration.

1035
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:31,940
FU2, or I'm sorry, a sub-discipline says he's angsty this week, so a big fat fuck you goes out to all the people at Fry's for not having metal pads when I really wanted them and had the money to buy them.

1036
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:39,940
I call, they say they have them, I get there, and they're like, oh, you mean the metal ones? We don't have those anymore. So fuck them for being fucking retarded cousin humping cock gobblers.

1037
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:50,940
Also, fuck you to my current pads for sucking so much. I can't pass any Oni's on these fucking steaming piles of monkey do that have arrows scrawled on them. Fuck those, fuck those poo pads.

1038
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:55,340
I- that's cool.

1039
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:58,780
That's almost as cool as ass meat.

1040
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:03,580
No, you missed this one, fuck those poohpads.

1041
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:08,060
Also fuck my new shoes for not being dusty and frip and shite.

1042
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:11,300
I get like 47 grates on Metsuuri Japan yesterday and that's too many.

1043
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:15,320
I miss my old DCs because they weren't flaming pieces of lemur shit.

1044
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:19,000
I could PA about as well as a mouse-finker now.

1045
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:25,000
It's okay. I'm gonna have more, so you have to promise to at least enter one of my upcoming ones.

1046
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,760
Fuck all the haircutters in my city for doing a lousy ass job every time I get a haircut.

1047
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:56,680
Fuck the mall for throwing you out for just carrying a skateboard.

1048
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:00,400
Fuck my dad for bitching about me doing stuff that I didn't do, plain and simple.

1049
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,000
No, screw my dad one.

1050
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Oops.

1051
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Oops.

1052
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,460
Fuck the pop and music nonstop for making me get one good three times in a row.

1053
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:10,880
Fuck you for being that shitty.

1054
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:15,200
Justin Serkis says, F you to my mom for making me come home from Orange Lounge early.

1055
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,520
F you to the troll lady too.

1056
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:20,180
Oh, and f you to kids meals for not making me any less hungry at Boston Market

1057
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:23,780
F you to my Shenmue backpack for being small

1058
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:28,500
F you to the guy who is riding his bike in the middle of the road around the place to turn into scandia

1059
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:31,140
That guy was so stupid

1060
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:36,220
He was in the middle of Madison on a bike in the middle crossing traffic for no reason

1061
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:42,580
What a moron and that and he looked like a troll too. You should have gotten another kids meal. Maybe you would have felt better

1062
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:49,580
FU to AOL and I'll leave it at that. FU to dumb people, FU to stupid kids at CGL.

1063
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:58,460
Alright, I have a fuck you. Fuck you for all these kids. There are probably twelve to fifteen

1064
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:01,860
that are thinking that AOL is the only way you can connect to the internet.

1065
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:07,200
Big fuck you to all you kids who post comments saying fuck you to other kids when you're

1066
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,300
a kid yourself.

1067
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:15,180
Fuck you to freaking AOL for ruining the whole theme to the Six Million Dollar Man.

1068
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:16,180
You suck.

1069
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:18,460
Their new commercial is the Six Million Dollar Man theme.

1070
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:19,460
They fucked it up.

1071
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:23,900
See, I don't watch TV, so I don't know these things.

1072
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:28,220
I still have AOL, but that's just because I don't want to get rid of my Doc's chocolate

1073
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:29,220
milk.

1074
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:37,380
I have the sentimental attachment I've had that theme for like nine years now.

1075
01:16:37,380 --> 01:17:00,380
Fuck you to war if you can even call it that. It's more like an assault, saying it's how Iraq can't do shit. They've got like three anti-aircraft water balloons and a Nerf gun. Who cares? Saddam gasses his own people, all those people suck dick, so fuck them too.

1076
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:02,380
Yeah, fuck that shit.

1077
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:13,380
One thing about that, BBC.com has actually a really good breakdown of what the average quality of life is as far as what people make, how much things cost.

1078
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:16,380
They wear pink scarves, goddammit!

1079
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:24,380
I just kinda, I mean, I understand what they think the reasons are. My brother's actually in the Marines, over in Kuwait right now.

1080
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:28,380
Are you gonna trust the media that's ran by Tony Blair?

1081
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:33,380
Well, apart from that, though, I mean, you could go look anywhere and find the same stats.

1082
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:38,380
But, um, I find it very funny that the average doctor makes $45 a month.

1083
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:41,380
Whereas, how much does the average doctor make per month?

1084
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:45,380
They maybe make $45 a half hour.

1085
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:52,380
As for old Tony Blair, I really don't like him, but I do like the fact that he was right up there with this raid to go to war with this one.

1086
01:17:52,380 --> 01:18:01,380
Uh, you know, Iraq doesn't really exist. It's just a giant pool for all the money, you know, that Bush is spending right now to go to the Area 51 and Alien Project things.

1087
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:05,380
Really, this whole war does not exist. It's a big, giant cover-up.

1088
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:09,380
You heard it here first!

1089
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:13,380
Yeah, I think he's trying to compensate for something.

1090
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:17,380
It's actually all taking place in a studio in New Mexico.

1091
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:21,380
Alright, I wanna give a fuck you out to France, Montreal and Quebec.

1092
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:25,580
First of all, yeah, it's not French fries anymore, it's American fries, and call everything

1093
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:26,580
Freedom Fries and American toast.

1094
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:27,580
Oh, you mean French fries aren't French?

1095
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:28,580
They're Belgian.

1096
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:29,580
They're from Belgium.

1097
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:34,580
Okay, about France real quick, how can we say, fuck you, because they were going to

1098
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:37,580
just go against one of our security resolutions that we proposed.

1099
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:45,300
I mean, come on, the U.S. has vetoed over 24 U.S. resolutions that were going to reprimand

1100
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:49,580
Israel for what they've done to the Palestinians, and we get pissed off because of one veto.

1101
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:52,580
How about Calvin, uh, Quete de Merde?

1102
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:55,580
Head of shit.

1103
01:18:56,580 --> 01:19:00,580
Speaking of head of state, that's gonna be a good movie.

1104
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:07,580
I'm getting so hot, I'm gonna be fine.

1105
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:17,780
I'm looking at a picture that Jazz posted in the chatroom, it's all greats on Happy

1106
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:19,780
Wedding in that queue.

1107
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:23,060
That'll get you a C, yeah, interesting.

1108
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:25,260
Alright, anyway, let's finish up the FUs.

1109
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,060
Not done yet.

1110
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:31,260
Mannequin Ego Jazz says, F you to having no money because now I can't go to March Madness.

1111
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:35,020
Christ, man, you need to get up here somehow.

1112
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:42,020
And now I'm going to jump the bandwagon, F.U. to being single.

1113
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:47,260
I'm white, what do you expect, babe?

1114
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:51,300
That's it. Oh, I have to check the mailbag, but as far as I know that's it, so...

1115
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:56,080
Does DDRHolic have something?

1116
01:19:56,080 --> 01:20:01,540
Once again, continuing F.U. to the DDR Extreme Roulette system.

1117
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:02,860
God dammit!

1118
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:09,860
Fucking A, every fucking time I do roulette, I get one away from Legend of Max, and you taunt me with your god damn shifting!

1119
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:16,860
It goes to Legend of Max, and it's like, HAH! You can't have that! You can have 2D Chaser Morning Mix instead, asshole!

1120
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:18,860
So, F you through the freaking roulette system.

1121
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:22,860
Alright, I could go on and on with fuck yous for the whole entire night.

1122
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:31,860
If anyone wants to hear the rest of my fuck yous, you can catch me on AIM under DarkChild999, that's C-H-Y-L-D-E-999,

1123
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:43,380
or on Yahoo on dchild999, or on ICQ at 110960221. Or you can email me at darkchild999 at hotmail

1124
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:50,860
dchild999 at Yahoo, jwilson at wowedy.net, wilsonjason at acmsystems.com, and I could

1125
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:51,860
go on and on, but that's enough.

1126
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:59,720
I wonder if I should make a Bomani Player Singles page on my website. That would be

1127
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:05,720
I want to give a fuck you out to Singular Wireless for only having reception when your phone is off.

1128
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:12,720
I don't know why what you said just gave me flashbacks to that thing posted on DDR Freak that J-Dog posted.

1129
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,720
The hi please date me thing.

1130
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,720
J-Dog sucks.

1131
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:22,720
Fuck you, J-Dog. Fuck you, Jason Ko.

1132
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:26,720
Care to elaborate on that as long as we're going to be controversial here?

1133
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:38,720
Fuck you for being a whiny little bitch because some people made fun of your little slide-slide-slide AM3P routine, made fun of it, had a good time, and you had a little hissy fit about it. Oh, poor baby.

1134
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:42,720
Address those cards and letters to D.

1135
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:46,720
Alright. G-town, yeah, yeah. We already gave up.

1136
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:53,720
Okay, so, I think we're finally done. Is everybody feeling a little less angsty now that we were able to get that off?

1137
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:56,720
I'm still angsty, I'm female!

1138
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,720
You didn't have any FUs, dear holly, do you have anything you want to say?

1139
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:01,720
She's playing with the ferret.

1140
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,720
One more, this one's a big one.

1141
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:08,720
Fuck you, U.S. Army, for still having me under obligation until August 23rd.

1142
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:11,720
I pray this war doesn't go bad.

1143
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,720
Eek!

1144
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,720
Alright, we're gonna take-

1145
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:20,720
We can put you on a boat in the cargo hold and send you to Taiwan.

1146
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,720
We're going to take a quick break and we'll be back.

1147
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,720
And when we come back from the break.

1148
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:29,720
Cheer train.

1149
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:30,720
What?

1150
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:31,720
Cheer train.

1151
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:32,720
Oh, you want to cheer train this.

1152
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,720
This is great.

1153
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:35,720
Just for.

1154
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,720
We want dancer.

1155
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,720
Dancer.

1156
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:41,720
Anything else?

1157
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:42,720
Dancer and that's it?

1158
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:43,720
Dancer and cheer train?

1159
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,720
And...

1160
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:47,720
Dude, play Paranoia Clean Mix.

1161
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:49,720
Alright, I'll see what I can dig up for you guys.

1162
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:50,720
Uh...

1163
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:51,720
No, play old stuff.

1164
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:52,720
Some old stuff after dancer?

1165
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:53,720
Yeah, old stuff.

1166
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:57,720
Alright, some old school stuff after dancer, and then we'll be back to talk about shit.

1167
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:59,720
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1168
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:36,720
Run out, I'm not fucking with you, I'm not fucking with you, I'm not fucking with you,

1169
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:09,720
Jojo, D.M.O. Rocka, the King. Jojo, D.M.O. Rocka.

1170
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:36,720
Roll the tape!

1171
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,720
Now

1172
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,720
Now

1173
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,720
Now

1174
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:16,720
Now

1175
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,720
Now

1176
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,720
What the hell?

1177
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:23,720
Let's go!

1178
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,720
Come on, come on, come on!

1179
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:30,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1180
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1181
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,720
Fuck you

1182
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:44,720
And the sun is shining

1183
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,120
Jeff one, Jeff one

1184
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:06,120
When I come down, I come down right to the sun

1185
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:08,720
And right down, you're right down the bend

1186
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:11,420
But I'm the loudest, who's my ghost in love?

1187
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:15,220
Tipped to the surface, got to the best, calm down, yeah

1188
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:18,720
Keep the head, nevertheless I'm the best of the best

1189
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:23,720
Get to the feelin', I'm stickin' the pose until nobody knows

1190
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:27,220
When I come, I'm runnin' from the ground to the head, no sound

1191
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,720
Yeah, get right down to a dip

1192
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:36,220
I said one, two, three, four, c'mon y'all, I get all this more

1193
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:41,220
Can't write down, look right down a chair I was round and round, stoop like a finger

1194
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:46,220
Come down, come down, sweet banana Get to the beaver

1195
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:49,220
I'm kickin' the floor, go to it right down a hill

1196
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:51,220
This is a ride when I kick it to the floor

1197
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:54,220
Come down, come down, sweet banana

1198
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:56,220
Never the less I'm impressed at the best

1199
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:58,220
Move it to two

1200
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:42,220
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

1201
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:50,220
Hi, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1202
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:51,220
We're back.

1203
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:53,660
Looks like you got horse crack.

1204
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:54,660
More derby again?

1205
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:55,660
Yeah.

1206
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:58,940
And my voice is pretty.

1207
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:02,940
So there's all new Bamani CDs or Bamani-related CDs coming out, I thought we could talk about

1208
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:03,940
a few of them.

1209
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:07,020
Loki, you might know more about this than I do, but I mean, the chat room's kind of

1210
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:11,740
been talking about this guy on and off tonight, and I thought maybe we'd bring him up.

1211
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:12,740
The Koutimou guy?

1212
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:13,740
Yeah.

1213
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:18,740
Yeah, he's got a CD coming out.

1214
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:30,740
You can sync up your VBMS to the Catimo V. And it works! It works!

1215
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:37,740
It feels cool. The one that you were playing over last night had them doing butterfly, but you can hear the background music. I think that's how they do it.

1216
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:43,740
He just did at least 100 seconds and some other one, I forget, with some other song.

1217
01:30:43,740 --> 01:30:44,740
Rob, you should play that.

1218
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:46,740
I tried to find them all.

1219
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:19,740
We have dead air space.

1220
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:24,740
Dead air space.

1221
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:29,740
We can't really find the continuous stuff right now.

1222
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:34,740
Maybe we'll look and see if we can get it later.

1223
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:39,740
What's new at the nice farmer's market?

1224
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:42,560
karaoke night

1225
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,560
you want to see you want to serenade us with some ddr karaoke

1226
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:47,800
sing for us in ddr

1227
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:52,560
you want some background music i don't know if i know the words to anything

1228
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:53,060
oh

1229
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:56,740
aye aye aye and your little butterfly

1230
01:31:56,740 --> 01:32:00,500
green black and blue paint like flowers in the sky

1231
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:03,780
aye aye aye

1232
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:08,040
and he just voiced the game

1233
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:31,600
Let's wait for D.W.I. to come out for that.

1234
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,900
innovation's turn. I remember we used to have some kind of really good butterfly

1235
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:40,440
rethink that we did for it. I don't think he remembers it though.

1236
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:51,960
Yeah, I can, I guess. I can't sing anything on a singer, though.

1237
01:32:51,960 --> 01:33:00,960
I can see the star, cause I'm in the sky. Wherever you are, I'm gonna see you fry.

1238
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:03,960
That was perfect.

1239
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:05,960
Okay, if you want something Japanese?

1240
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:07,960
What?

1241
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:09,960
We have ferret mix.

1242
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:10,960
I'm gonna die.

1243
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:24,120
Sounds kind of like, when that parrot when it makes that like really like freaky sound,

1244
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:26,680
it's like, sounds kind of like corn-holio.

1245
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,480
See if I can get it.

1246
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,600
No, that's the sneeze.

1247
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,320
No, that's the sneeze.

1248
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:33,320
That's the sneeze.

1249
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:37,320
That freaky sound sounds kind of like Cornholio.

1250
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:41,320
Let's see if I can get it. No, that's the sneeze. No, that's not it either.

1251
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:45,320
I keep messing with this thing because it's not saying the right thing.

1252
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:49,320
No.

1253
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:53,320
There it is. Damn, Cornholio!

1254
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:57,320
Alright, am I playing this other Kootemu clip here that we wanted to hear?

1255
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:31,520
beautiful

1256
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,520
dude that shit rocks

1257
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,560
that's the first time I heard that

1258
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:40,460
so is it true this guy's got a CD coming out or what's the deal with this

1259
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:43,400
it's not really a CD he just makes

1260
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:46,800
supposed CDs but they're just a bunch of MP3's that he has

1261
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:50,580
uh... he's doing like a non-stop of his songs and he's doing

1262
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:54,180
some new ones I forget what was on the list of stuff to be done

1263
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:57,080
uh... if you could pull up our forums again

1264
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:59,080
We can check that because I actually wrote it down on there.

1265
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:00,080
Come on, come on.

1266
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:00,580
All right.

1267
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:01,080
Buy one.

1268
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:01,580
Hold on.

1269
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:02,080
Oh.

1270
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:02,580
Oh.

1271
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:03,580
It's actually not.

1272
01:36:06,580 --> 01:36:10,080
But let's see here.

1273
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:10,580
Oh, shit.

1274
01:36:10,580 --> 01:36:12,280
I can't remember offhand what he was doing.

1275
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:13,080
There's some good ones.

1276
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:13,580
Ow.

1277
01:36:13,580 --> 01:36:16,080
Think I lost it from BeatMania, if I remember correctly.

1278
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:17,080
Um.

1279
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:18,080
Right.

1280
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,080
Ah, shit.

1281
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:21,580
Let me see here.

1282
01:36:21,580 --> 01:36:22,080
Doo-doo-doo-doo.

1283
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:23,080
The meat bar.

1284
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:23,580
Meat bar.

1285
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:24,580
Snickers bar.

1286
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:25,080
Uh.

1287
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:29,600

of t t r i guess i was i have no idea

1292

i think

1293
01:36:41,820 --> 01:36:44,360
i think that's a dance dance revolution song though

1294
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:46,080
only one uh...

1295
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,560

1297
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:52,500

power of mouth which also will be a pack of DWI is coming out soon maybe the

1300
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:12,360
power of mouth sounds like it an erotic title I know it sounds like pretty yeah

1301
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:16,920
that's that should have been one of those rejected erotic songs yeah we

1302
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:21,380
talked about a couple weeks ago and then I was listening but speaking of CD

1303

re-releases, uh, DanceMania is putting out a whole shitload of albums this month. Yeah,

1305
01:37:34,780 --> 01:37:39,420
DanceMania EX2 was the last one that came out in the actual DanceMania line, but a lot

1306
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:45,900
of the sister compilations, uh, well, let's think, let's think. Okay. There's been 10

Right.

1314
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:07,460
Okay.

1315
01:38:07,460 --> 01:38:10,500
So, anyone, these are the new ones that are coming out very soon, or are already out in

1316
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:11,740
Japan, they're just not over here yet.

1317
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:12,740
I want the freaking festive hardcore.

1318
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:16,740
Okay, there's Base Eleven Hyper Best, which is...

1319
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:17,740
Any samples?

1320
01:38:17,740 --> 01:38:18,740
Huh?

1321
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:20,740
I don't think there's any samples for this one, I...

1322
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:21,740
Oh, there's one.

1323
01:38:21,740 --> 01:38:22,740
Where?

1324
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:23,740
Where's a sample?

1325
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:24,740
Oh, never mind.

1326
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:25,740
No, it wasn't a sample.

1327
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:30,900
It has my baby mama on it, so you know this is more of like a best.

1328
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:33,740
There's Like A Virgin and Billie Jean.

1329
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:36,140
Oh, God.

1330
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:37,700
Best of Hardcore.

1331
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:38,940
Speed presents the best of hardcore.

1332
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:40,940
Now that has to be mine.

1333
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:46,000

1365
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,000
we just kind of

1366
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:23,040
forgot about

1367
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:27,920
speaking shit on this. I've got enough stuff to do with Rain website and doing god knows

1368
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:28,920
weather stuff.

1369
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:32,680
Does the TVWI contest, does that involve alcohol?

1370
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:43,280
For StepMania, we are having a contest where pick a TV song, not a remixed version, not

1371
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:52,320
a long version, just a TV theme song and make steps for it.

1372
01:41:52,320 --> 01:42:01,480
We have one for Mr. Rogers, and it's kind of, uh, stupid.

1373
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:03,640
I personally want to see one for two stupid dogs.

1374
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:09,720
You've seen two stupid dogs, right?

1375
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:13,720
That shit was cool.

1376
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:19,040
I want one for two stupid dogs, and for Freaky Soy.

1377
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:20,040
I made one for Funky Brewster.

1378
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:24,260
It's so slow to do it in double speed

1379
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:31,480
No, she's not she got her reduction

1380
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:39,540
She looked pretty hot in the in the pumpkinhead movies though

1381
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:41,360
Okay, first of all

1382
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:46,800
I want to know what you think is more attractive having really huge boobs and walking with a hunch or

1383
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:48,720
having

1384
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:52,000
Not as big boobs, but still big and walking upright

1385
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:58,040
Wait, this is where you think you're gonna get me but you're wrong. I didn't say big boobs at all

1386
01:42:58,040 --> 01:43:03,920
I said she got boobs firm breasts are what's good firm breasts are the greatest

1387
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:10,020
I don't care if they have to be huge or what but firm firm breasts or what is awesome. Okay?

1388
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:13,340
If I'm allowed to touch them, it doesn't matter

1389
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:19,340
Loki, were you breastfed as a baby, or not?

1390
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:23,340
Wasn't practically everyone on the face of the earth, pretty much.

1391
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:24,340
No.

1392
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:26,340
We'll see, we know how you...

1393
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:27,340
Yeah.

1394
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:30,340
Are you an 80's child?

1395
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:33,340
I was, and my mom used cloth diapers.

1396
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:37,340
I was a natural child.

1397
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:38,340
I'm sorry...

1398
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:42,340
I was told I was breastfed, but I refused it.

1399
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:51,040
I'm sorry but my sister they tried to breastfeed her and she was allergic to

1400
01:43:51,040 --> 01:44:01,440
natural milk so it would make her sick how does that suck like a baby like um

1401
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:06,340
basically when it comes to a girl I don't want knee slappers you know I want

1402
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:08,340
to sit where they're supposed to sit.

1403
01:44:36,340 --> 01:44:38,100
down to your knees.

1404
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:41,780
I don't want you looking like some freaking huge freak with these giant breasts that look

1405
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:44,180
like god knows what.

1406
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:46,380
And I also don't want you looking like a little boy, so uh...

1407
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:47,380
No, Bellaboy!

1408
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:48,380
In J-Cups!

1409
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:54,460
No, no, the ones that are really scary, the ones that have like these gigantic breasts

1410
01:44:54,460 --> 01:44:59,420
and they are firm, but they're so ungodly huge that it's freakish.

1411
01:44:59,420 --> 01:45:00,420
That's weird.

1412
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:02,780
No, I think what's weird is when you have those chicks with like the super huge, I mean

1413
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:08,260
like double F triple F whatever and then they have the super tiny nipples like

1414
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:12,460
super tidy boy nipples that is scary no but like look you would say about like

1415
01:45:12,460 --> 01:45:16,220
the whole firm and big thing you don't want them to look like that punching bag

1416
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:21,200
game at scandia you just want to walk up and just get like a full swig and just

1417
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:26,180
sock em or something and this my channel presents the brand new double o size bra

1418
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:30,740
but no it's weird though is like okay cuz I took these I took a picture with

1419
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:34,260
these two chicks when we went to the easy rider bike show and they're like

1420
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:37,580
some of the models anywhere they basically they for the pictures they sit

1421
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:41,700
in your lap which is really sweet but their breasts were like up against my

1422
01:45:41,700 --> 01:45:47,060
chest it it's just like felt weird because it was like unnaturally firm it

1423
01:45:47,060 --> 01:45:54,620
was like not rocks but like it's like dirt there these like um balls I've seen

1424
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:58,140
where they're kind of like you know those inflatable beach ball type things

1425
01:45:58,140 --> 01:46:03,640
But they're like, they're a little bit firm, but it feels like an over-inflated beach ball.

1426
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:06,140
I think they need to have their sailing changed.

1427
01:46:06,140 --> 01:46:07,140
Yeah.

1428
01:46:07,140 --> 01:46:14,380
All right, what I think is incredibly stupid is there's these, and they're mostly novelty

1429
01:46:14,380 --> 01:46:15,380
models, it's true.

1430
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:20,320
This was a lot back when I was still in high school watching Geraldo or something, one

1431
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:21,920
of those talk shows.

1432
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:27,340
And they had these women on there who had had their chest enlarged to G size and up.

1433
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:34,020
seriously each boob was like the size of a small country it was like the size of

1434
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:38,180
they could have dropped those boobs on Iraq not quite as big as quit I'm

1435
01:46:38,180 --> 01:46:48,220
thinking more like like Dixon sign but they were you know you think they're

1436
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:53,060
They're going to need back braces when they're 50.

1437
01:46:53,060 --> 01:46:57,060
What if they made their spine out of steel?

1438
01:46:57,060 --> 01:47:03,300
If they had their spine out of steel, then maybe that might work.

1439
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:06,980
Usually I would be surprised that y'all could talk about for breasts for so long, but then

1440
01:47:06,980 --> 01:47:10,220
I remember what show I'm on.

1441
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:16,140
Don't you have a fascination with boobs?

1442
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:24,420
are interesting. I wouldn't want them for myself. But yeah, boobs are funny. Boobs are

1443
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:33,100
the punchline to a good joke. Knock knock, who's there? Boobs! Sweet. On that note, why

1444
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:39,180
don't we get to this week's cage match? What do you guys think? I won last week. What's

1445
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:40,180
It's a cage match.

1446
01:47:40,180 --> 01:47:41,180
We pick songs.

1447
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:42,180
I'm sorry, I'm a noob.

1448
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:43,180
Not me!

1449
01:47:43,180 --> 01:47:44,180
I'm day off.

1450
01:47:44,180 --> 01:47:57,540
Anyway, the cage match is where we each pick a song, and since we've been into it, one

1451
01:47:57,540 --> 01:48:00,420
of us will have won last week, so our song remains over.

1452
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:04,280
So the other two people will bring in a new song, and chat room votes on what they think

1453
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:08,700
is the best song, but we go around and rate it, sort of, you know, American Idol style.

1454
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:17,940
You know, usually with our generous person here, the bipolar person here, and the super

1455
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:18,940
cynic.

1456
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:20,940
So, yeah, cynic, you.

1457
01:48:20,940 --> 01:48:28,700
And then our chat room gets to vote, and we vote after all the songs we've played.

1458
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:32,180
And I'm special because I won last week, but they hated my song from the week before so

1459
01:48:32,180 --> 01:48:35,140
we voted it off the island and I picked a new one.

1460
01:48:35,140 --> 01:48:36,140
So...

1461
01:48:36,140 --> 01:48:39,180
Alright, so we're getting to this week?

1462
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:40,580
Alright, real quick.

1463
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:41,580
Yes.

1464
01:48:41,580 --> 01:48:46,260
Fuck you with obscure survivor references.

1465
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:51,780
So uh, like um, yeah I've got my track and everything, but I've got two, so do you guys

1466
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:54,820
want to hear a house track, or a trance track?

1467
01:48:54,820 --> 01:48:56,860
A house track, or a trance?

1468
01:48:56,860 --> 01:48:57,860
A trance.

1469
01:48:57,860 --> 01:49:02,620
Do you want to let the chatroom decide, or do you want to let us decide?

1470
01:49:02,620 --> 01:49:16,740
We have either a sort of disco-y, but really hardhouse track, or we've got opera trance.

1471
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:19,940
How about you use one this week and use the other one next week?

1472
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:20,940
Fine!

1473
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:21,940
Fine!

1474
01:49:21,940 --> 01:49:22,940
Fine!

1475
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:23,940
We get opera trance.

1476
01:49:23,940 --> 01:49:27,660
While Loki shows me where the opera trance song is, why don't you listen to a clip of

1477
01:49:27,660 --> 01:49:31,240
last week's winner because we only play we only play a clip of the one that won

1478
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:35,400
last week because you're already hearing it on the station because it won so last

1479
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:42,060
week in the cage match Jamie brought to us a song by a group called beatbox and

1480
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:46,000
they do this trance cover of a song called what a wonderful world give it a

1481
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:53,000
try

1482
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Don't you watch the brightest, blessed days, the dark, sacred nights, and things in my face.

1483
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:37,000
What a wonderful world

1484
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:02,860
It's the vocal club mix, it's actually a little bit different than the one that you might have seen

1485
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:08,860
Bamani Ruhler's edit for, it's more vocals in it, and it's Opera Trance featuring Emma Sheplin.

1486
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:13,740
Alright, enjoy, this is Loki's pick. The title one more time?

1487
01:51:13,740 --> 01:51:14,820
Spente Lestalle.

1488
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:18,380
Spente Lestalle, or if you just want to vote for it, you can call it Opera Trance.

1489
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:22,380
But remember, you can't vote until we've played all three songs, so here's the opera trance song.

1490
01:52:18,380 --> 01:52:20,380
When you're with me

1491
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:27,380
You are never there to see

1492
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:35,380
Even if you go

1493
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:49,380
La dónde, la dónde, la dónde dónde

1494
01:53:35,380 --> 01:53:36,380
Hey!

1495
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:37,380
Hey!

1496
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:38,380
Hey!

1497
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:39,380
Hey!

1498
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:59,060
All right, that was Spente Listele from Opera Trance.

1499
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:01,900
And by the way, that song is also on Dance Mania 20.

1500
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:02,900
Did you know that?

1501
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:03,900
Yeah, it is.

1502
01:55:03,900 --> 01:55:06,660
Anyway, yeah, it's kind of neat.

1503
01:55:06,660 --> 01:55:08,540
So good night.

1504
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:11,540
Okay, so here we go. What do you guys think of that? Go around the room.

1505
01:55:11,540 --> 01:55:14,540
It's cool and I liked it once it picked up. I'd give it an 8.

1506
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:20,540
I like it. I'd give it a 9. I like opera stuff like that.

1507
01:55:21,540 --> 01:55:26,540
It reminds me of techno mafia music, so I'd give it a 10.

1508
01:55:27,540 --> 01:55:31,540
I second that of techno mafia stuff. I'd give it a 10 as well.

1509
01:55:32,540 --> 01:55:35,540
I was severely disappointed so much I gave it a 10.

1510
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:45,900
it was okay seven okay I have a little bit of backstory to my pick because I

1511
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:49,940
know I'm gonna get shit for this but I don't care because everybody tells me

1512
01:55:49,940 --> 01:55:54,700
everybody tells me I never can pick a song that wins so I figure fine I'm

1513
01:55:54,700 --> 01:55:59,340
gonna go over the deep end this week but I'm I decided that you know everybody

1514
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:01,780
says oh you gotta pick something from sci-fam that's how you're gonna win this

1515
01:56:01,780 --> 01:56:05,980
He picked something from PsyFam, so I told, I asked JB,

1516
01:56:05,980 --> 01:56:08,280
Oh, give me a song from PsyFam that's sure to win it, and he said,

1517
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:12,280
You know what, Rob? This song's very you, and I think you'll like it.

1518
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:14,380
So I'm gonna, uh, put this in the cage mess tonight.

1519
01:56:15,180 --> 01:56:20,380
And this is DJ Speedo featuring Wildside, and Wildside is, uh, as you know,

1520
01:56:20,380 --> 01:56:23,980
the group that did Irresistible Mint from DDR Extreme.

1521
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:29,680
And the song is called Assoneejay, but you might notice a different name.

1522
01:56:29,680 --> 01:56:34,860
And I'm so gonna die, but I don't care so enjoy

1523
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:33,040
Baby, to baby, baby, you know I'mma be happy

1524
02:00:36,020 --> 02:00:39,920
Baby, to baby, baby, you know I'mma be happy

1525
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:43,920
Oh, that song was pretty boofy, pretty boofy.

1526
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:48,920
Hey, hey, haha, let's give it a two.

1527
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:53,920
Wait, wait, wait, we got a little, oh, okay, we got a curling event.

1528
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:55,920
MoCap Curling!

1529
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:57,920
Hello, Cage Match song.

1530
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:03,920
Jason has got a vacuum cleaner head thing, and we got a little ball rolling.

1531
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:08,920
And Mike's throwing the ball, and Jason is vacuuming the floor ahead of the ball.

1532
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:15,920
Hello! Back to cage match, Loki!

1533
02:02:16,180 --> 02:02:21,360
Okay, this song violated so many rules. Number one, being a ketchup song, it sucked ass.

1534
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:24,400
Number two, it's a speed mix, which really sucks ass.

1535
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:28,460
And number three, I'm mad at Syfan right now, so that also sucked ass.

1536
02:02:28,460 --> 02:02:35,460
So I give this song a native of 100, but the Kirlin gets a 10.

1537
02:02:35,860 --> 02:02:37,520
Alright, uh...

1538
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:41,720
I hate that song just because it sounds too much like Happy Hardcore to me

1539
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:44,040
and I can't stand little candy kids

1540
02:02:44,040 --> 02:02:47,480
so I'm gonna give it a three

1541
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:52,080
because it had a decent beat to it, so three

1542
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:55,520
Asian innovation

1543
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:59,080
seeing that I left the room because the song sucks so much

1544
02:02:59,080 --> 02:03:03,980
I'll give it a, out of a scale of one to ten, I'll give it a suck

1545
02:03:03,980 --> 02:03:06,680
and uh... of course my pick

1546
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:11,320
uh... i thought it was wonderful is that correct

1547
02:03:11,320 --> 02:03:14,520
that balances out the side of the rock all you can't take a joke all right

1548
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:17,120
uh... are a damn liar

1549
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:21,080
and jimmy gets a zero for hitting me in the nose with the ball

1550
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:24,800
i gave it it's not have to get a new those like share jesus i give that a ten

1551
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:25,800
all right

1552
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:29,400
well i thought you'd be happy that i didn't get in the nose of the forest

1553
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:31,100
review what you can pick tonight

1554
02:03:31,100 --> 02:03:32,480
shall we

1555
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:36,360
the first one you can pick and i have to uh...

1556
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:39,840
I have to cue it up, because I accidentally got rid of the CD.

1557
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:41,600
All right, here's the first one you can vote for.

1558
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:42,520
Here's a clip.

1559
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:44,840
Beat Fox with What a Wonderful World, last week's winner.

1560
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:46,320
And now, the winner.

1561
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:46,820
The world.

1562
02:03:55,160 --> 02:03:56,320
Second one you can vote for.

1563
02:03:56,320 --> 02:03:59,680
This is Spente La Stelle, also known as Opera Trance.

1564
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:00,760
You can vote for that.

1565
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:14,360
Also, you can vote for DJ Speedo featuring Wildside with Asaregé, also known as the

1566
02:04:14,360 --> 02:04:16,160
catch-up song.

1567
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:26,920
All right, you can vote for any one of those three.

1568
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:29,000
send your votes right now over

1569
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,220
private message in the chat room to sky

1570
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:34,700
if you vote for that we will end and i will tally up those votes and let you

1571
02:04:34,700 --> 02:04:38,460
know who wins a little later in the show and god damn i hope i win finally

1572
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:40,720
uh...

1573
02:04:40,720 --> 02:04:43,720
i think there's a lot of people vote for me just cuz they feel sorry for me

1574
02:04:43,720 --> 02:04:49,280
uh... and i think that i don't know we got a little and i don't feel sorry

1575
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:53,800
for robs keep in mind that i think that for that song you have to hear it

1576
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:59,920
for two weeks. That's right, because there's no show next week, so whatever wins tonight

1577
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:06,920
is two weeks. So choose wisely. God, I hope I win. Or we'll kill you. Alright. My ball.

1578
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:14,760
My ball. Moving on, any other topics you guys want to discuss? What was this curling thing

1579
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:20,120
you guys were doing with the vacuum? My ball. They're playing with their balls and sticks.

1580
02:05:20,120 --> 02:05:24,640
Your song sucked so horribly, we had to entertain ourselves and everyone else who was suffering

1581
02:05:24,640 --> 02:05:25,860
in this room.

1582
02:05:25,860 --> 02:05:26,860
So we were curling.

1583
02:05:26,860 --> 02:05:27,860
It's an Olympic sport.

1584
02:05:27,860 --> 02:05:37,160
It doesn't get as much recognition as the other sports, but it's pretty hard because,

1585
02:05:37,160 --> 02:05:41,780
I mean, you have to be really athletic to be a curler, especially in the Olympics, because

1586
02:05:41,780 --> 02:05:44,240
you have this broom, right?

1587
02:05:44,240 --> 02:05:48,620
And you kind of need to know how to skate, and then you also...

1588
02:05:48,620 --> 02:05:50,900
They have the ice shoes on, but it's still hard.

1589
02:05:50,900 --> 02:05:54,080
And you have to sweep the floor.

1590
02:05:54,080 --> 02:05:55,820
You got to keep ahead of whatever things are called.

1591
02:05:55,820 --> 02:06:00,740
You have to keep ahead of the mallet ball thingy hockey puck thing that they do.

1592
02:06:00,740 --> 02:06:01,740
Yeah.

1593
02:06:01,740 --> 02:06:02,740
And pretty much it's...

1594
02:06:02,740 --> 02:06:04,300
It's like a big lead weight with a handle.

1595
02:06:04,300 --> 02:06:05,300
Yeah.

1596
02:06:05,300 --> 02:06:09,860
For all you curling fans out there, you have to, depending on how fast, you have to get

1597
02:06:09,860 --> 02:06:11,300
this target at the end.

1598
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:15,620
I'm sweating my ass off and we just curled twice and it was only like 10 feet.

1599
02:06:15,620 --> 02:06:16,620
Yeah.

1600
02:06:16,620 --> 02:06:19,860
Basically, you have to use the broom to reduce or increase the friction.

1601
02:06:19,860 --> 02:06:21,340
It's kind of weird, you know?

1602
02:06:21,340 --> 02:06:22,100
Simple point.

1603
02:06:22,100 --> 02:06:28,020
But yeah, the brooms are only if hockey was played with brooms.

1604
02:06:28,020 --> 02:06:30,220
Man, the puck would go so much faster.

1605
02:06:30,220 --> 02:06:31,220
Simple point.

1606
02:06:31,220 --> 02:06:32,980
It's a Canadian sport.

1607
02:06:32,980 --> 02:06:35,420
Well, just remember, look for me in Asian Innovation

1608
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:37,660
in the next Winter Olympics.

1609
02:06:37,660 --> 02:06:40,820
We'll be trying to represent Sacramento and the Bay Area.

1610
02:06:40,820 --> 02:06:45,340
Team Sacramento curling 2008 in Beijing when they have no ice.

1611
02:06:45,340 --> 02:06:47,340
Let's go.

1612
02:06:47,340 --> 02:06:53,340
You know, you missed a show a couple weeks ago, we were talking about different mocap games that they could make.

1613
02:06:53,340 --> 02:06:55,340
MOCAP CURLY!

1614
02:06:55,340 --> 02:06:57,340
Yes!

1615
02:06:57,340 --> 02:07:01,340
We did a list list, which we'll hopefully get to a list list segment tonight, I don't know.

1616
02:07:01,340 --> 02:07:05,340
Although I'm thinking, you know, instead of list lists, you know what we haven't done in a long time?

1617
02:07:05,340 --> 02:07:09,340
Let's do a Maimani match game tonight, what do you guys think?

1618
02:07:09,340 --> 02:07:12,340
Alright, you wanna do that? We'll do a Maimani match game tonight.

1619
02:07:12,340 --> 02:07:14,340
I'm a noob, you'll have to explain again.

1620
02:07:14,340 --> 02:07:18,340
I can explain it to you guys. I can do that.

1621
02:07:18,340 --> 02:07:23,340
If I can find Matt's theme on my computer somewhere, I hope so.

1622
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:28,340
I could just come up with some porn themes off the top of my head.

1623
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:33,340
We'll end the show with Ask Orange Lounge. We'll do that later.

1624
02:07:33,340 --> 02:07:36,340
So, but we'll get to that in a little bit.

1625
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:41,340
Because I have to have time to write up questions so we have to take a break before we go to that.

1626
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:12,900
to keep

1627
02:08:12,900 --> 02:08:14,700
do you think it's going to be

1628
02:08:14,700 --> 02:08:15,580
malibu's

1629
02:08:15,580 --> 02:08:17,980
but what is that

1630
02:08:17,980 --> 02:08:20,340
there's money now

1631
02:08:20,340 --> 02:08:24,320

02:09:07,180 --> 02:09:12,060
votes already. There's not that many votes. There's not that many votes in right now for

1645
02:09:12,060 --> 02:09:21,780
Cage Match. There's not that many votes in right now for Cage Match, which is, you know

1646
02:09:21,780 --> 02:09:30,080
what happens when nobody votes? The underdog wins. All right. When no one votes, we gang

1647
02:09:30,080 --> 02:09:35,060
up on Robin, then we win. Okay, if the underdog wins, I put zero votes, zero points for that

1648
02:09:35,060 --> 02:09:41,380
opera trance because it sucked ass and I give 10 to that crappy ass happy hardcore wannabe

Welcome to Orange Lunch Radio, where love is orange!

1680
02:18:09,540 --> 02:18:12,220
Shaving monkeys is always permitted.

1681
02:18:12,220 --> 02:18:12,940
Just kidding.

1682
02:18:12,940 --> 02:18:14,060
But...

1683
02:18:14,060 --> 02:18:15,100
But, yes.

1684
02:18:15,100 --> 02:18:17,180
Technical plans. Look who's on your face.

1685
02:18:17,180 --> 02:18:22,180
You scare the monkey, you don't come in.

1686
02:18:22,180 --> 02:18:26,180
No, no. I'll just bring Shermy.

1687
02:18:26,180 --> 02:18:28,340
If Shermy doesn't like you, leave.

1688
02:18:28,340 --> 02:18:33,020
For cheating, as always, I'm brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

1689
02:18:33,020 --> 02:18:35,680
Hello again.

1690
02:18:35,680 --> 02:18:37,860
We're back. The monkeys sling poo.

1691
02:18:37,860 --> 02:18:42,540
and uh... i bet you'd love to know who won the cage match

1692
02:18:42,540 --> 02:18:46,700
well it was very close to you know it's funny we had a vote for oprah trance

1693
02:18:46,700 --> 02:18:51,180
yeah i think that she's the

1694
02:18:51,180 --> 02:18:55,340
i hate to say this but it did win by one

1695
02:18:55,340 --> 02:18:57,420
votes

1696
02:18:57,420 --> 02:18:59,380
by one

1697
02:18:59,380 --> 02:19:04,140
stinking boats haha

1698
02:19:04,140 --> 02:19:08,980
The chatroom conspired to go over trans wanted it.

1699
02:19:08,980 --> 02:19:12,900
By one vote over the catch up song. I'm so mad.

1700
02:19:12,900 --> 02:19:16,060
Damn you people.

1701
02:19:16,060 --> 02:19:19,960
See they planned it out. They wanted you to make you think you were going to win.

1702
02:19:19,960 --> 02:19:21,580
And then slide in that last vote.

1703
02:19:21,580 --> 02:19:26,040
I know. You all got together. You're plotting against me I cried.

1704
02:19:26,040 --> 02:19:28,060
The big fat pickle song.

1705
02:19:28,060 --> 02:19:33,000
Someone make me a big fat pickle song.

1706
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:40,000
I'm a cute cover, I'm a cute cover, I'm a cute cover, I'm a cute cover, I'm a cute cover,

1707
02:19:42,160 --> 02:19:45,360
We need some paper, we need some paper for this next segment, do we have some paper in

1708
02:19:45,360 --> 02:19:50,360
here? Do we have paper? We need paper. Do you have sheets you can share with the rest

1709
02:19:50,360 --> 02:19:54,920
of us? Paper, paper. Oh I have one, I have a page. Okay, somebody can use the back of

1710
02:19:54,920 --> 02:20:01,920
this. Yes? I have a suggestion, because I've been noticing that this game is kind of flawed

1711
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:13,920
What we need to do is we need to get the answers from the contestants, but don't read them off and then get the answers from us first, then we get the contestants' answers.

1712
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:20,920
You know what I'm saying? Because in that way we're not influenced by their answers.

1713
02:20:20,920 --> 02:20:25,920
What are you doing?

1714
02:20:25,920 --> 02:20:32,360
Uh, yeah, I, I, sorry, there's somebody, uh, Darchild's using the, uh, air duster on his

1715
02:20:32,360 --> 02:20:36,800
head. Um, seven people match me this time. We should, we should do it like how we did

1716
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:39,640
it with loaded crescents and just show each other how we wrote our answers.

1717
02:20:39,640 --> 02:20:42,840
Um, I, I agree. We'll do, okay, we'll do that different this week and see how that works.

1718
02:20:42,840 --> 02:20:47,720
We'll read the contestants' answers last. But, in order to get contestants, we have

1719
02:20:47,720 --> 02:20:54,160
to get the, we have to have them answer a simple trivia question. Let's see, um.

1720
02:20:54,160 --> 02:20:59,320
What do you think? What's a good trivia question for them to answer?

1721
02:20:59,320 --> 02:21:01,640
The penis mightier.

1722
02:21:01,640 --> 02:21:05,560
No, it's got to be something gettable. It's got to be something easy. It's got to be something stupid.

1723
02:21:05,560 --> 02:21:10,360
What is the square of pi?

1724
02:21:10,360 --> 02:21:16,040
What is the formula for a mole if you're in school? You should know this.

1725
02:21:16,040 --> 02:21:20,920
I haven't been in school for a while.

1726
02:21:20,920 --> 02:21:21,920
She said a bunch of stuff.

1727
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:22,920
How about this?

1728
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:23,920
What's 75 squared?

1729
02:21:23,920 --> 02:21:24,920
What's 85 squared?

1730
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:25,920
Who is the artist?

1731
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:35,360
The only thing that I learned when I was in school is how to avoid people and what a mole

1732
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:36,360
is.

1733
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:40,920
Which, by the way, is 6.02 times 10 to the negative 23rd power.

1734
02:21:40,920 --> 02:21:42,520
All right, how about this?

1735
02:21:42,520 --> 02:21:43,520
We'll make it really easy.

1736
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:46,080
Well, Colgan's boot size was a 16 in 1985.

1737
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:48,160
No, I don't think so.

1738
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:49,160
Sorry.

1739
02:21:49,160 --> 02:21:56,160
Okay, whoever is the first two people to tell me what the fifth digit of Pi is.

1740
02:22:02,160 --> 02:22:07,160
Okay, the first two people who tell me, and you've got to send their own private message or it doesn't count, the fifth digit of Pi.

1741
02:22:08,160 --> 02:22:12,160
Because that was a big topic on DDR Freak earlier this week, so.

1742
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:14,160
It's I, right?

1743
02:22:14,160 --> 02:22:15,160
Okay, here we go, let's see.

1744
02:22:15,160 --> 02:22:16,160
I.

1745
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:20,640
okay the fifth digit of pi

1746
02:22:20,640 --> 02:22:25,280
I think the fifth digit of pi is pi

1747
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:28,040
it's the letter E P I E E E

1748
02:22:28,040 --> 02:22:31,200
right? okay let's see

1749
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:35,000
the fifth digit of me is my pinky

1750
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:38,360
alright here we go here we go let's see who got it we got our winners

1751
02:22:38,360 --> 02:22:41,800
so we got three one four one

1752
02:22:41,800 --> 02:22:45,320
five so it's five

1753
02:22:45,320 --> 02:22:53,080
Jazz said, well, he did say five, but he said four first. Sorry. JB got it, so JB's in.

1754
02:22:53,080 --> 02:23:00,360
He was next. And let's see. Well, it looks like we got 23rd Magus, so there you go.

1755
02:23:00,360 --> 02:23:02,200
I thought you were counting from the end of pi.

1756
02:23:02,200 --> 02:23:04,680
No, sorry, I was not counting from the end of pi. So there you go.

1757
02:23:04,680 --> 02:23:11,720
It's the end of pi. That's why I said it so fast.

1758
02:23:11,720 --> 02:23:16,720
Alright, here we go. We got our two contestants. We have JB and 23rd Magus. Alright, here we go.

1759
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:20,720
Oh, the way the match game works, because you guys, not everybody's been here before.

1760
02:23:20,720 --> 02:23:24,720
We're going to read questions and they'll have a blank in them, and we have to fill in the blank.

1761
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:28,720
And if the contestants match what you say, then they get a point.

1762
02:23:28,720 --> 02:23:34,720
And what does our fabulous winner tonight get? Now they're both local, so they can actually get a prize tonight.

1763
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:37,720
They get nothing. Absolutely nothing.

1764
02:23:37,720 --> 02:23:42,720
You get a free magazine at March Madness.

1765
02:23:42,720 --> 02:23:47,720
Ooh, a magazine for the winner. Okay, here we go.

1766
02:23:47,720 --> 02:23:52,720

Asian innovation

I feel that sexy

1799
02:25:31,360 --> 02:25:34,420
Yeah!

1800
02:25:34,420 --> 02:25:37,340
I know you love me!

1801
02:25:37,340 --> 02:25:42,440
And then of course me.

1802
02:25:42,440 --> 02:25:45,220
Because I'm beautiful, dammit. Alright, let's get started.

1803
02:25:45,220 --> 02:25:49,160
First question!

1804
02:25:49,160 --> 02:25:51,520
Here we go.

1805
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:57,600
Mr. Mike Ngo, also known as Asian Innovation.

1806
02:25:57,600 --> 02:25:59,480
And what do you know, he's here.

1807
02:25:59,480 --> 02:26:03,740
He was already to practice, I'm sorry, he was already to participate in the 2DX

1808
02:26:03,740 --> 02:26:05,280
tournament in Sacramento

1809
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:06,880
at March Madness.

1810
02:26:06,880 --> 02:26:11,480
When he heard that he didn't like any of the qualifier songs, he got so angry

1811
02:26:11,480 --> 02:26:18,060
that he ran over to Scandia and decided to blank.

1812
02:26:18,060 --> 02:26:21,440
Mike was already to participate in the 2DX tournament in Sacramento, but when he

1813
02:26:21,440 --> 02:26:25,680
he heard that he didn't like any of the qualifier songs, he got so angry that he ran over to

1814
02:26:25,680 --> 02:26:48,680
Scandinavia and decided to blank. I have one contestant locked in. And we have both of

1815
02:26:48,680 --> 02:26:55,680
the

1816
02:27:03,860 --> 02:27:05,040
that's okay

1817
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:12,040
it's a very own personal reference you know

1818
02:27:12,040 --> 02:27:19,040
Alright, you ready? Bang, Anita! You don't have to write no novel!

1819
02:27:20,040 --> 02:27:25,600
Alright, here we go. Let's first, now we're doing a different this week, so we have the

1820
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:28,400
contestants locked in, let's see what the celebrities said.

1821
02:27:28,400 --> 02:27:33,880
Jamie, Mike got so angry that he decided to go to Scandia and...

1822
02:27:33,880 --> 02:27:39,080
Play prop cycle instead. Play prop cycle instead.

1823
02:27:39,080 --> 02:27:42,720
Anita, Mike got so angry he decided to...

1824
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:44,920
Yodel at the top of his lungs.

1825
02:27:44,920 --> 02:27:47,760
Yodel at the top of his lungs!

1826
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:52,040
Loki, got so mad he decided to...

1827
02:27:52,040 --> 02:27:55,920
Start curling.

1828
02:27:55,920 --> 02:27:58,240
Zero.

1829
02:27:58,240 --> 02:28:02,960
He got so mad he mistakenly killed the Scandia kids instead of the RPGL kids.

1830
02:28:02,960 --> 02:28:05,320
Darchau?

1831
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:12,320
I got so angry he decided to kill my mom.

1832
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:15,800
Mike got so angry he decided to

1833
02:28:15,800 --> 02:28:19,920
Kill DJ Syndrome and make a fake song list.

1834
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:22,560
Kill DJ Syndrome and make a fake song list. Beautiful.

1835
02:28:22,560 --> 02:28:29,560
I said Mike got so angry that he decided to go to Scandinavia and defecate on a child.

1836
02:28:29,560 --> 02:28:41,120
Alright, let's see what the contestants said. JB said, roll on the ground. No, I'm sorry,

1837
02:28:41,120 --> 02:28:48,840
that is not a match. 23 Magus said, hump the coin slot. He decided to run the Scandi and

1838
02:28:48,840 --> 02:28:53,600
hump the coin slot. Wow, they actually had to get on the machine then. That's a good

1839
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:59,920
one. I like that one. Oh, can I change my answer to the quick one? No, you cannot change

1840
02:28:59,920 --> 02:29:07,920
your answer. Alright. So, no points. That's okay. It's still a tie. Let's go to the next

1841
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:13,440
question. Question number two. Darkchild has been out of the Bamani scene a long time.

1842
02:29:13,440 --> 02:29:18,720
He came back out of the darkness to see what was new in the scene, and he was surprised

1843
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:25,720
the thing that had changed most in the scene was blank.

1844
02:29:48,720 --> 02:30:03,680
Wow, that sound of silence is like a deep thought.

1845
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:07,640
Okay read it again.

1846
02:30:07,640 --> 02:30:10,240
Dark Child has been out of the Bamani scene a long time.

1847
02:30:10,240 --> 02:30:14,180
He came back out of the darkness to see what was new in the scene and he was surprised

1848
02:30:14,180 --> 02:30:21,180
that the thing that had changed most in the scene was blank.

1849
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:30,280
Be very, very quiet. People are thinking. Is there all the celebrities about walked

1850
02:30:30,280 --> 02:30:37,280
in? A couple still writing. I'm waiting on one contestant. Any day now.

1851
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:49,660
contestant any day now the thing that changed most in the scene was blank yes

1852
02:30:49,660 --> 02:30:56,660
this

1853
02:30:57,380 --> 02:31:07,380
come on contestants

1854
02:31:07,380 --> 02:31:13,180
are all the celebrities done? Yes, all the celebrities done. We're waiting on a contestant

1855
02:31:13,180 --> 02:31:18,180
I think we got it

1856
02:31:18,180 --> 02:31:22,740
Beautiful. Jamie, your answer.

1857
02:31:22,740 --> 02:31:25,900
The only thing that had changed was the stench. No one bothered to shower after

1858
02:31:25,900 --> 02:31:30,260
still trying to PA paranoia.

1859
02:31:30,260 --> 02:31:33,260
The stench.

1860
02:31:33,260 --> 02:31:35,260
Alright.

1861
02:31:35,260 --> 02:31:38,580
Anita, the thing that had changed most in the scene was...

1862
02:31:38,580 --> 02:31:43,260
Was all the DDR players were now wearing one white glove.

1863
02:31:43,260 --> 02:31:50,260
All the DDR players were now wearing one white glove.

1864
02:31:50,260 --> 02:31:53,260
Loki, the thing that had changed most in the scene was?

1865
02:31:53,260 --> 02:31:55,260
I gotta follow that.

1866
02:31:55,260 --> 02:31:56,260
Yes.

1867
02:31:56,260 --> 02:31:58,260
Um...

1868
02:31:58,260 --> 02:32:01,260
I didn't really come up with anything funny, so...

1869
02:32:01,260 --> 02:32:05,260
All the DDR players are little kids that are really stupid and should die.

1870
02:32:05,260 --> 02:32:08,260
Okay, all the DDR players are little kids that are stupid and should die.

1871
02:32:08,260 --> 02:32:10,260
Okay, zero.

1872
02:32:10,260 --> 02:32:16,260
I couldn't come up with anything, so I figured the thing that changed the most was the child molesting gangbangers.

1873
02:32:40,260 --> 02:33:09,940
I don't know if that counts, what do you guys think?

1874
02:33:09,940 --> 02:33:11,620
Who said the RVGL thing?

1875
02:33:11,620 --> 02:33:12,620
Somebody said something about RVGL.

1876
02:33:12,620 --> 02:33:13,620
Was that zero?

1877
02:33:13,620 --> 02:33:14,620
No.

1878
02:33:14,620 --> 02:33:15,620
Okay.

1879
02:33:15,620 --> 02:33:16,620
Sorry.

1880
02:33:16,620 --> 02:33:17,620
Zero.

1881
02:33:17,620 --> 02:33:18,620
Zero.

1882
02:33:18,620 --> 02:33:19,620
None.

1883
02:33:19,620 --> 02:33:20,620
Zip.

1884
02:33:20,620 --> 02:33:21,620
Zip.

1885
02:33:21,620 --> 02:33:22,620
Okay.

1886
02:33:22,620 --> 02:33:23,620
It's still tied.

1887
02:33:23,620 --> 02:33:24,620
Here we go.

1888
02:33:24,620 --> 02:33:25,620
Next question.

1889
02:33:25,620 --> 02:33:33,580
Jamie one day found herself on a deserted island with a shiny necklace on.

1890
02:33:33,580 --> 02:33:37,660
She noticed that she was surrounded by children from Roseville Golf Land.

1891
02:33:37,660 --> 02:33:54,500
The first thing she reached for was her blank.

1892
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:58,460
Jamie one day found herself on a deserted island with a shiny necklace on.

1893
02:33:58,460 --> 02:34:01,500
She noticed that she was surrounded by children from Roseville Golf Land.

1894
02:34:01,500 --> 02:34:05,080
The first thing she reached for was her blank.

1895
02:34:05,080 --> 02:34:12,080
We have both our contestants in. How about the celebrities?

1896
02:34:13,160 --> 02:34:20,160
Okay. Working on it. How you doing, Anita? About ready. Almost done. Anita doing another

1897
02:34:23,480 --> 02:34:30,480
marathon answer. Okay. Alright, Jamie woke up on a deserted island

1898
02:34:30,480 --> 02:34:35,400
Alright, Jamie woke up on a deserted island with a shiny necklace on.

1899
02:34:35,400 --> 02:34:37,600
She noticed she was surrounded by children from Roseau Golf Land.

1900
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:40,200
The first thing she reached for was her blank.

1901
02:34:40,200 --> 02:34:41,200
Ready?

1902
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:43,560
Jamie, what was the first thing Jamie reached for?

1903
02:34:43,560 --> 02:34:44,560
Propel.

1904
02:34:44,560 --> 02:34:46,920
RVGL children are easy targets.

1905
02:34:46,920 --> 02:34:50,480
Alright, Anita, the first thing she reached for was her...

1906
02:34:50,480 --> 02:34:55,120
Was her coconut nunchakus to open up a can of whoop-ass.

1907
02:34:55,120 --> 02:34:57,120
Coconut nunchakus.

1908
02:34:57,120 --> 02:34:59,120
Who's going to get that one?

1909
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:34,120
my own. Dude, I just ripped theirs off.

1910
02:35:36,160 --> 02:35:43,160
Dark child. God, my mind is dirty. A jizz rack to wipe off that shiny necklace. I need

1911
02:35:49,720 --> 02:35:56,000
to stay off the internet. Oh, my lord. Okay, Asian invasion.

1912
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
The first thing she reached for was her...

1913
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:01,000
Immediately after that, she reached for a crack pipe.

1914
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:06,000
Jamie! You have a crack pipe?

1915
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:11,000
Alright. I said the first thing she reached for was her fan!

1916
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Remember the movie? The guy with the fan? Yeah, alright.

1917
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Okay. JB said the first thing she reached for was check for a match.

1918
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:22,000
The Fam was cool.

1919
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:26,000
We're going to check for a match.

1920
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:29,000
JB said the first thing she reached for was her fork.

1921
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:30,000
I almost said that.

1922
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:35,000
I almost said fork, but then again, RBGL children have herpes.

1923
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:42,000
23rd Magus said the first thing she reached for was her boom stick.

1924
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:43,000
Good movie reference.

1925
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Boom stick!

1926
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Very good movie reference.

1927
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
Sam Raimi is God.

1928
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:51,560
still tied up

1929
02:36:51,560 --> 02:36:56,320
still tied up at nothing nothing or at least one of the one wins right

1930
02:36:56,320 --> 02:36:58,920
low-key

1931
02:36:58,920 --> 02:37:04,160
low-key was really excited to be moving into a new apartment very soon

1932
02:37:04,160 --> 02:37:07,680
a couple days before the move though he started to worry

1933
02:37:07,680 --> 02:37:14,680
what am i going to do about packing my massive collection of blank

1934
02:37:14,680 --> 02:37:21,680
It doesn't have to be the obvious. Do whatever you want. You gotta want to match the contestants. Do say what the contestants would say.

1935
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:31,680
Loki was really excited to be moving into a new apartment very soon. A couple days before the move, though, he started to worry. What am I going to do about packing my massive collection of blank?

1936
02:37:35,680 --> 02:37:37,680
I came up with an answer very quickly.

1937
02:37:37,680 --> 02:37:46,640
Oh, we have one contestant locked in.

1938
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:50,000
I think that's both contestants.

1939
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:54,120
All right, are all the celebrities ready?

1940
02:37:54,120 --> 02:38:07,520
Okay, I'm almost ready, almost, okay, how do you spell, never mind, how do you spell

02:38:46,560 --> 02:38:48,840
Dark child.

02:38:48,840 --> 02:38:50,720
Real dolls.

1954
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:53,280
Real dolls. Oh!

For those who don't know, um...

1957
02:38:57,080 --> 02:39:01,560
they're really high-end, non-blow-up girlfriends. I mean, fully articulate, they

1958
02:39:01,560 --> 02:39:02,920
look realistic.

1959
02:39:02,920 --> 02:39:07,480
on real sex a guy's girlfriend. They had men ones too with like big cocks. I don't care

1960
02:39:07,480 --> 02:39:10,800
about the men ones. And they said that they were working on the ones that actually came.

1961
02:39:10,800 --> 02:39:17,800
ReelBell.com. I knew he was all excited. Okay, recent innovation is massive collection. Toenail

1962
02:39:19,720 --> 02:39:26,720
clippings. Of toenail clippings. Aw, sorry, not a match. I said, Loki, what is he going

1963
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:29,960
what am I getting what is he going to do about packing his massive collection of

1964
02:39:29,960 --> 02:39:32,800
cok rings

1965
02:39:33,080 --> 02:39:41,600
cock rings Scott all right let's see what the contestants said let's see if

1966
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:44,980
we get a match 23rd Maggots says what is Loki going to do about packing his

1967
02:39:44,980 --> 02:39:51,480
massive collection of porn JB says what is he going to do about packing his

1968
02:39:51,480 --> 02:39:56,480
his massive collection of porn. Both contestants said porn, no match.

1969
02:39:56,480 --> 02:40:00,480
It's funny that all the underage people think of porn.

1970
02:40:00,480 --> 02:40:03,480
Shame on all of you perverts. We think of murder, right?

1971
02:40:03,480 --> 02:40:07,480
Alright, last question. I don't have a massive collection of porn.

1972
02:40:07,480 --> 02:40:10,480
It's way outweighed by the massive collection of dead babies.

1973
02:40:10,480 --> 02:40:15,480
Last question, this is your chance to shine. Just to be fair, I was going to say porn,

1974
02:40:15,480 --> 02:40:18,480
but I thought someone else in the group would have already taken it.

1975
02:40:18,480 --> 02:40:25,480
Rob got made a lot of fun of for playing the catch-up song on Orange Lounge Radio. After

1976
02:40:25,480 --> 02:40:31,480
Rob got made a lot of fun of for playing the catch-up song on Orange Lounge Radio.

1977
02:40:31,480 --> 02:40:35,960
lounge radio. After the show was over, the room decided that his punishment should be

1978
02:40:35,960 --> 02:40:42,960
blank. Alright, Rob got made a lot of fun of for playing the catch-up song on Orange

1979
02:40:42,960 --> 02:41:02,120
Rob got made a lot of fun of for playing the catch-up song on Orange Lounge Radio.

1980
02:41:02,120 --> 02:41:09,200
After the show was over, the room decided that this punishment should be blank.

1981
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:10,580
We have both our contestants locked in.

1982
02:41:10,580 --> 02:41:20,140
is everybody else in the room? Anita. I'm just writing my chapter here. Okay, I'm done.

1983
02:41:20,140 --> 02:41:25,140
Okay, here we go. Jamie, his punishment should be? To drink his weight in ketchup. To drink

1984
02:41:25,140 --> 02:41:31,680
his weight in ketchup. That's a lot of ketchup. Anita. Oh, I didn't get quite as creative.

1985
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:38,680
punishment shall be to watch twenty four hours of the playboy channel

1986
02:41:40,060 --> 02:41:44,180
garden soft core at that jesus leases hardcore it's somewhat excited would

1987
02:41:44,180 --> 02:41:48,100
fall asleep after that i would i would fall asleep after about like a few

1988
02:41:48,100 --> 02:41:49,260
minutes of that

1989
02:41:49,260 --> 02:41:51,540
it's awful about five minutes for looking

1990
02:41:51,540 --> 02:41:52,980
uh...

1991
02:41:52,980 --> 02:41:54,220
it's it's like

1992
02:41:54,220 --> 02:41:56,260
what do you mean i'm moving my best

1993
02:41:56,260 --> 02:41:58,580
I mean, it's just like, who cares?

1994
02:41:58,580 --> 02:42:02,540
It's so- why are you, like, sneaking into some person's house to rub your breasts?

1995
02:42:02,540 --> 02:42:03,760
It makes no sense!

1996
02:42:03,760 --> 02:42:05,440
I thought you liked breasts!

1997
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:07,840
Yeah, but it makes no sense when you're just standing there going,

1998
02:42:07,840 --> 02:42:12,080
Oh, look at me, I'm standing here in the wind, exotic location,

1999
02:42:12,080 --> 02:42:14,080
rubbing my breasts for no reason!

2000
02:42:14,080 --> 02:42:17,900
Just standing there- she's not having sex, she's not, like, you know,

2001
02:42:17,900 --> 02:42:18,700
sponsored by the algorithm.

2002
02:42:18,700 --> 02:42:21,800
In and on or anything, she's just standing there saying,

2003
02:42:21,800 --> 02:42:24,700
Look at me, I'm sexy looking!

2004
02:42:24,700 --> 02:42:28,000
If you had the Playboy channel at my house, I'd end up turning it to CNN.

2005
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:32,500
Dude, let's just put it this way. I get every single Playboy movie that comes out, and they all suck ass.

2006
02:42:32,500 --> 02:42:37,500
They're all regurgitated clips from older Playboy movies, and it's just, it's awful. They try to think-

2007
02:42:37,500 --> 02:42:40,200
Oh my God, are you out of gear?

2008
02:42:40,200 --> 02:42:41,900
Girls Gone Boring.

2009
02:42:41,900 --> 02:42:47,200
Okay, my answer was, punishment would be Rob would have to go straight.

2010
02:42:47,200 --> 02:42:49,400
I almost said that.

2011
02:42:49,400 --> 02:42:53,500
And by the way, they probably rub their breasts because it's cold on the beach. They gotta get warm.

2012
02:42:53,500 --> 02:43:01,500
I don't understand how their nipples stick out all the time. How is that possible? Ice cubes? No, I don't want them.

2013
02:43:01,500 --> 02:43:05,500
Alright, I'm done.

2014
02:43:05,500 --> 02:43:07,500
I said...

2015
02:43:07,500 --> 02:43:09,500
It's called airbrushing.

2016
02:43:09,500 --> 02:43:16,500
I said at the end of the show Rob would have to fuck the ferret.

2017
02:43:16,500 --> 02:43:17,500
How lovely.

2018
02:43:17,500 --> 02:43:20,500
Dark child. Rob's punishment should be...

2019
02:43:20,500 --> 02:43:23,180
Jesus Christ, I am a child of the internet.

2020
02:43:23,180 --> 02:43:25,940
Go down on everyone in the room and swallow.

2021
02:43:25,940 --> 02:43:27,220
Ah!

2022
02:43:27,220 --> 02:43:29,980
That is punishment, Jesus.

2023
02:43:29,980 --> 02:43:31,380
That's punishment for everybody.

2024
02:43:41,380 --> 02:43:43,580
You get to sell popcorn, there'll be plenty of salt.

2025
02:43:43,580 --> 02:43:45,340
All right.

2026
02:43:45,340 --> 02:43:48,540
It's an invasion.

2027
02:43:48,540 --> 02:43:50,620
porn is the funniest thing ever

2028
02:43:50,620 --> 02:43:55,100
it's not exciting or anything it's just funny

2029
02:43:55,100 --> 02:43:57,500
using innovation rob's punishment should be

2030
02:43:57,500 --> 02:43:59,240
the catch-up song

2031
02:43:59,240 --> 02:44:02,060
uh...

2032
02:44:02,060 --> 02:44:03,720
good a good answer

2033
02:44:03,720 --> 02:44:07,180
and uh... my answer would be that robs punishment should be to have sex with

2034
02:44:07,180 --> 02:44:12,180
lots of hot people

2035
02:44:12,180 --> 02:44:13,780
uh...

2036
02:44:13,780 --> 02:44:15,620
uh... it sounds like treatment

2037
02:44:15,620 --> 02:44:17,300
rob

2038
02:44:17,300 --> 02:44:19,820
i think that

2039
02:44:19,820 --> 02:44:22,740
who have leprosy

2040
02:44:22,740 --> 02:44:27,380
rock and

2041
02:44:27,380 --> 02:44:29,540
let's see if we actually got a match

2042
02:44:29,540 --> 02:44:33,620
jb said robs punishment should be to be spent

2043
02:44:33,620 --> 02:44:35,060
who

2044
02:44:35,060 --> 02:44:37,300
that's that's a reward that

2045
02:44:37,300 --> 02:44:38,980
twenty-third depends who by

2046
02:44:38,980 --> 02:44:43,860
i mean if we're talking like you know

2047
02:44:43,860 --> 02:44:45,700
uh... twenty-third bag is said

2048
02:44:45,700 --> 02:44:49,820
his punishment should be to be beaten with orange bats nobody said go straight

2049
02:44:49,820 --> 02:44:51,620
you guys cannot have said

2050
02:44:51,620 --> 02:44:52,620
go straight

2051
02:44:52,620 --> 02:44:56,940
that was the most obvious answer

2052
02:44:56,940 --> 02:44:58,340
i don't know

2053
02:44:58,340 --> 02:45:03,340
you tell me

2054
02:45:03,340 --> 02:45:06,340
Okay, cause boys are stupid anyway. Except for the company.

2055
02:45:08,340 --> 02:45:09,340
On that note...

2056
02:45:09,340 --> 02:45:11,340
So, we have our big finish.

2057
02:45:11,340 --> 02:45:14,340
The big scores, here they are, let's total it up.

2058
02:45:15,340 --> 02:45:18,340
JB has a score of zero!

2059
02:45:18,340 --> 02:45:21,340
And 23Magus has a score of zero!

2060
02:45:21,340 --> 02:45:23,340
You win nothing!

2061
02:45:23,340 --> 02:45:26,340
Nothing at all! Good day, sir!

2062
02:45:26,340 --> 02:45:29,340
Wow, you couldn't even get a magazine, that's pretty fair.

2063
02:45:29,340 --> 02:45:30,340
So, this is what happens.

2064
02:45:30,340 --> 02:45:34,940
As punishment, you two get all of the punishments that were mentioned earlier.

2065
02:45:34,940 --> 02:45:36,340
So there you go.

2066
02:45:36,340 --> 02:45:37,340
Live at March Madness.

2067
02:45:37,340 --> 02:45:42,620
So they get to be spanked, anally raped, and then get hot people.

2068
02:45:42,620 --> 02:45:44,860
And then go down on all of us.

2069
02:45:44,860 --> 02:45:45,860
They're underage!

2070
02:45:45,860 --> 02:45:52,980
Hey, but remember, one of your punishments was, uh, hey Rob, one of the punishments,

2071
02:45:52,980 --> 02:45:57,300
though, is get to have sex with a bunch of hot people.

2072
02:45:57,300 --> 02:45:58,300
That's true!

2073
02:45:58,300 --> 02:46:04,240
for that one. That's very true. Yeah, but I'll take the game back for the ferret. No,

2074
02:46:04,240 --> 02:46:10,640
it ain't happening. Alright, so they're demanding a tiebreaker, but you know what, we don't

2075
02:46:10,640 --> 02:46:12,720
have much time, because we have to take a quick break, and then we're going to come

Oops. No, we're not doing match game anymore. I have to queue up the other music.

2101
02:48:52,560 --> 02:48:57,940
So this is a little segment we do when we need some time filler because our chat room

2102
02:48:57,940 --> 02:49:02,700
is very creative so we allow them to ask Orange Lounge.

2103
02:49:02,700 --> 02:49:05,940
So here we go.

2104
02:49:05,940 --> 02:49:07,260
Shows ten minutes longer.

2105
02:49:07,260 --> 02:49:08,260
Yes.

2106
02:49:08,260 --> 02:49:09,260
Alright.

2107
02:49:09,260 --> 02:49:10,260
Ask us questions.

2108
02:49:10,260 --> 02:49:12,720
Here we go.

2109
02:49:12,720 --> 02:49:18,060
Ask Orange Lounge or tonight you can ask Jart Child or Asian Innovation.

2110
02:49:18,060 --> 02:49:22,420
twenty third magus says seriously though if i beg and plead enough will orange

2111
02:49:22,420 --> 02:49:29,140

2112
02:49:29,140 --> 02:49:33,200
if i endure all punishments mentioned will i get sponsored

2113
02:49:33,200 --> 02:49:36,360
that would be amusing

2114
02:49:36,360 --> 02:49:41,720
uh... it's a guy

2115
02:49:41,720 --> 02:49:43,220
should we consider it

2116
02:49:43,220 --> 02:49:45,340
we'll consider it

2117
02:49:45,340 --> 02:49:50,820
We have to see. Keep in mind that one of us is unemployed.

2118
02:49:50,820 --> 02:49:56,140
If you could out-treat me on Bacardi 151, I will sponsor you.

2119
02:49:56,140 --> 02:49:59,740
I'll pay your way in. Come to think of it, I think it would be worth it to see his

2120
02:49:59,740 --> 02:50:03,460
freestyle.

2121
02:50:03,460 --> 02:50:07,420
I'll do it. Yeah, one of us will do it. We'll figure it out. But you need to try and come up with the money

2122
02:50:07,420 --> 02:50:10,020
yourself, because if we have to sponsor you, we're making you do something

2123
02:50:10,020 --> 02:50:14,340
humiliating.

2124
02:50:14,340 --> 02:50:16,700
okay

2125
02:50:16,700 --> 02:50:19,820

we have a question for asian innovation from the d r mike

2143
02:52:08,580 --> 02:52:12,500
We have two questions.

2144
02:52:12,500 --> 02:52:16,300
How much weight did you put on from yesterday's party?

2145
02:52:16,300 --> 02:52:18,620
I only had two ribs.

2146
02:52:18,620 --> 02:52:21,220
But, yeah.

2147
02:52:21,220 --> 02:52:26,700
And then, how is that horrible, wonderful job at Jack in the Box?

2148
02:52:26,700 --> 02:52:32,420
I don't know, I give most of the food to you.

2149
02:52:32,420 --> 02:52:33,300
Beautiful.

2150
02:52:33,300 --> 02:52:37,380
And that's all the questions I've gotten so far for Ask Orange Lounge, so we'll

2151
02:52:37,380 --> 02:52:39,380
We'll give him a couple more minutes.

2152
02:52:39,380 --> 02:52:44,380
You're not funny, Mike. Quit laughing.

2153
02:52:44,380 --> 02:52:49,380
Does anybody have a question for someone else here in the room?

2154
02:52:49,380 --> 02:52:52,380
Will someone hire me? Please?

2155
02:52:52,380 --> 02:52:53,380
I got a job.

2156
02:52:53,380 --> 02:52:55,380
What are your job qualifications?

2157
02:52:55,380 --> 02:53:03,380
Well, my resume is on Rob's computer.

2158
02:53:03,380 --> 02:53:05,380
Oh my God, I love this porn!

2159
02:53:05,380 --> 02:53:07,380
Is that resume in MPEG or TwitchCon?

2160
02:53:07,380 --> 02:53:09,380
Okay, Rob, you said watch Ally McFeel with me.

2161
02:53:09,380 --> 02:53:11,380
Oh my God, you are gay.

2162
02:53:14,380 --> 02:53:16,380
That was the funniest porn ever.

2163
02:53:16,380 --> 02:53:19,380
Ally McFeel had fucking Ron Jeremy in it, it was awesome.

2164
02:53:20,380 --> 02:53:21,380
Sweet.

2165
02:53:21,380 --> 02:53:22,380
God, Jeremy is a god.

2166
02:53:22,380 --> 02:53:24,380
He can't suck his own penis anymore.

2167
02:53:24,380 --> 02:53:26,380
Have you seen Pornstar, The Legend of Ron Jeremy?

2168
02:53:26,380 --> 02:53:27,380
No, I have not.

2169
02:53:27,380 --> 02:53:28,380
It's a sweet movie.

2170
02:53:28,380 --> 02:53:29,380
Ran it.

2171
02:53:29,380 --> 02:53:30,380
Is it porn?

2172
02:53:30,380 --> 02:53:36,380
It's not actually porn, but I mean, they have like little clips and things, but it's still kind of, it's NC-17, but not really porn.

2173
02:53:36,380 --> 02:53:40,380
What's this word, rent? I don't understand this word, rent.

2174
02:53:40,380 --> 02:53:41,380
Rent.

2175
02:53:41,380 --> 02:53:46,380
I have kazah, what's rent? Is that when I delete it after I watch it?

2176
02:53:46,380 --> 02:53:51,380
Yes, yes, that's when you, you only have 24 hours after downloading this.

2177
02:53:51,380 --> 02:53:54,380
Okay, more questions.

2178
02:53:54,380 --> 02:54:00,380
Question for the chatroom? Anyone in there? Find me Battle Royale Special Edition and buy it for me.

2179
02:54:24,380 --> 02:54:26,760
dot t k

2180
02:54:26,760 --> 02:54:30,160
that's a little scary let's let's look at the site real fast loki what do you think

2181
02:54:30,160 --> 02:54:32,080
of this

2182
02:54:32,080 --> 02:54:33,960
all the way to think of her to this

2183
02:54:33,960 --> 02:54:36,720
word it's just those remix

2184
02:54:36,720 --> 02:54:41,080
found fancy and uh... were songs

2185
02:54:41,080 --> 02:54:45,680
and i know there's a guy that's been a real seem to realize

2186
02:54:45,680 --> 02:54:49,920
i think i played one of the evidence playing headache it hurts

2187
02:54:49,920 --> 02:54:52,080
did not play one of those the other night

2188
02:54:52,080 --> 02:54:54,160
your party I think I do have all these already

2189
02:54:54,160 --> 02:54:57,500
I think I played one of them, they're alright

2190
02:54:57,500 --> 02:55:02,080
I think Squaresoft rocks, I'll go to that page

2191
02:55:02,080 --> 02:55:04,580
but that's not Orange when I'm talking, that's just me

2192
02:55:04,580 --> 02:55:11,580
DDR Mike by the way says her her shut up squinty eyed Asian hoe

2193
02:55:14,240 --> 02:55:17,700
why did he call you a hoe?

2194
02:55:17,700 --> 02:55:20,080
I'll be over at your house tonight at eleven

2195
02:55:20,080 --> 02:55:21,880
ba dum bum

2196
02:55:21,880 --> 02:55:28,880
Alright, the other hoe, DarkTetsuyu wants to know, how come more females don't come in the chat room? Cry.

2197
02:55:28,880 --> 02:55:32,880
That's because there's no one there who excites them enough.

2198
02:55:32,880 --> 02:55:34,880
They're too busy cooking.

2199
02:55:34,880 --> 02:55:39,880
Are there females coming in the chat room right now?

2200
02:55:39,880 --> 02:55:44,880
First of all, they don't come in the chat room because it'll make a big stinky mess.

2201
02:55:44,880 --> 02:55:46,880
Yeah, they don't come because you haven't found G-Spot.

2202
02:55:46,880 --> 02:55:48,880
It's because I haven't been here yet.

2203
02:55:48,880 --> 02:55:52,880
Because I can't come when you fuck me.

2204
02:55:52,880 --> 02:55:56,880
Yeah, if a girl was coming, she wouldn't be in the chat room.

2205
02:55:56,880 --> 02:56:00,880
Alright. Last one.

2206
02:56:00,880 --> 02:56:04,880
Last one. Here we go. Last question from Justin Circuit.

2207
02:56:04,880 --> 02:56:08,880
Can you give me money?

2208
02:56:08,880 --> 02:56:12,880
Depends on what you'll do for me. I'll give you a dollar.

2209
02:56:12,880 --> 02:56:16,880
Can you give me stuff? Can you give me head?

2210
02:56:16,880 --> 02:56:20,880
I'll close my eyes.

2211
02:56:20,880 --> 02:56:24,880
Alright.

2212
02:56:24,880 --> 02:56:28,880
I'll give him money from Argentina.

2213
02:56:28,880 --> 02:56:32,880
Okay, so, on that note, that's the end of Ask Orange Lounge. Alright, one more, there's one more, there's one more.

2214
02:56:32,880 --> 02:56:36,880
One more, this is the last question, this is a good one to end it on, because it kind of relates to March Madness.

2215
02:56:36,880 --> 02:56:40,880
SkylineDC505 wants to know,

2216
02:56:40,880 --> 02:56:44,880
would doing bag 5-speed for the qualifier be noobish?

2217
02:56:44,880 --> 02:56:50,880
Go ahead, I don't care. Just do it on one speed later on. Have fun.

2218
02:56:50,880 --> 02:56:56,880
Okay, and now's that time of the show where we have to wrap it up.

2219
02:56:56,880 --> 02:56:59,880
But first, we go around the room and get everyone's final thoughts.

2220
02:56:59,880 --> 02:57:02,880
Rob, can we wrap it up in ribbon and bows?

2221
02:57:02,880 --> 02:57:04,880
And confetti.

2222
02:57:04,880 --> 02:57:05,880
And leather.

2223
02:57:05,880 --> 02:57:08,880
And chains. And whips.

2224
02:57:08,880 --> 02:57:11,880
Okay, now I'm getting into this.

2225
02:57:11,880 --> 02:57:18,080
And, and, like, playing hot pokers.

2226
02:57:18,080 --> 02:57:21,560
I don't have much to say, how about, pika-choo!

2227
02:57:21,560 --> 02:57:29,740
All I gotta say is, unfortunately, there will not be an update to my site tonight or tomorrow

2228
02:57:29,740 --> 02:57:33,320
because I have a headache and I'll probably be going to sleep.

2229
02:57:33,320 --> 02:57:35,320
So maybe Tuesday.

2230
02:57:35,320 --> 02:57:36,760
What?

2231
02:57:36,760 --> 02:58:01,760
I accept this award on the behalf of myself, because you all suck. And one last thing,

2232
02:58:01,760 --> 02:58:12,400
are cool. You're so cute. You're the coolest girl in the world. I declare war on Iraq because

2233
02:58:12,400 --> 02:58:21,460
I'm a Texan. Bang, bang, bang. I'm a Texan. Bang, bang. April 15th, go buy your Miyazaki

2234
02:58:21,460 --> 02:58:26,320
films Castle in the Sky, Spirited Away, and Kiki's Delivery Service come out on DVD in

2235
02:58:26,320 --> 02:58:33,060
And April 19th is my birthday, so give me stuff.

2236
02:58:33,060 --> 02:58:34,060
Your final thought, Mike?

2237
02:58:34,060 --> 02:58:35,060
Go to March Madness, please.

2238
02:58:35,060 --> 02:58:37,180
I don't want to turn out like five people.

2239
02:58:37,180 --> 02:58:38,180
All right, thanks.

2240
02:58:38,180 --> 02:58:39,180
Bye.

2241
02:58:39,180 --> 02:58:42,180
My final thought is Zelda comes out tomorrow.

2242
02:58:42,180 --> 02:58:44,940
Is anyone moist?

2243
02:58:44,940 --> 02:58:47,220
Has anyone already played it?

2244
02:58:47,220 --> 02:58:50,200
All right.

2245
02:58:50,200 --> 02:58:51,200
That's it.

2246
02:58:51,200 --> 02:58:52,200
End of show.

2247
02:58:52,200 --> 02:58:58,020
NO SHOW NEXT WEEK BECAUSE WE'RE LIVE ALL DAY LONG SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.

2248
02:58:58,020 --> 02:58:59,020
LISTEN FOR GOD'S SAKE.

2249
02:58:59,020 --> 02:59:00,020
Or at least come to the tournament.

2250
02:59:00,020 --> 02:59:01,020
As if COVID lessons will never do it again.

2251
02:59:01,020 --> 02:59:02,020
Just kidding.

2252
02:59:02,020 --> 02:59:03,020
We're already planning on doing it at V3 as well.

2253
02:59:03,020 --> 02:59:04,020
But not after that.

2254
02:59:04,020 --> 02:59:05,020
Alright.

2255
02:59:05,020 --> 02:59:06,020
Thank you very much for listening.

2256
02:59:06,020 --> 02:59:11,280

2264
02:59:38,180 --> 02:59:41,180
Go, go, Power Rangers!

2265
02:59:41,180 --> 02:59:44,180
Hey, dudes! Hey, you just changed! Yeah, I know, we always change characters every day.

2266
02:59:44,180 --> 02:59:46,180
Hey, I'm a little kid and I'm going to join the Power Rangers. How do you know about us?

2267
02:59:46,180 --> 02:59:48,180
How can I watch the show every day? Oh, OK.

2268
02:59:48,180 --> 02:59:50,180
Hey, guys, look, it's those three teenagers that...

2269
02:59:50,180 --> 02:59:52,180
Exactly match the Power Rangers personalities and their voices and every single thing about them.

2270
02:59:52,180 --> 02:59:53,180
Let's go harass them.

2271
02:59:53,180 --> 02:59:54,180
Oh, OK, well, come on.

2272
02:59:54,180 --> 02:59:55,180
OK, go.

2273
02:59:55,180 --> 02:59:56,180
Hey, we don't train that, just...

2274
02:59:56,180 --> 02:59:57,180
Come on, you know...

2275
02:59:58,180 --> 03:00:00,180
Yay, you're not supposed to get on board with that!

2276
03:00:02,180 --> 03:00:03,180
Rangers, Rangers, what?

2277
03:00:04,180 --> 03:00:05,180
What do you know?

2278
03:00:06,180 --> 03:00:07,180
Five teenagers without a tube.

2279
03:00:07,180 --> 03:00:08,180
What's wrong? What's going on?

2280
03:00:08,180 --> 03:00:10,180
There's a bunch of disturbances going on.

2281
03:00:10,180 --> 03:00:11,180
Oh, really? You'd better check it out.

2282
03:00:11,180 --> 03:00:12,180
Ah!

2283
03:00:12,180 --> 03:00:13,180
Ah!

2284
03:00:13,180 --> 03:00:14,180
Oh, no, it's a monster! The terrorizing city!

2285
03:00:14,180 --> 03:00:15,180
Rawr! What are you doing here?

2286
03:00:15,180 --> 03:00:17,180
I'm the last of the world to have a giant pig!

2287
03:00:17,180 --> 03:00:18,180
Oh, I eat stuff!

2288
03:00:18,180 --> 03:00:19,180
Oh no, we need to destroy him!

2289
03:00:19,180 --> 03:00:20,180
Snap it on!

2290
03:00:20,180 --> 03:00:21,180
Give it back!

2291
03:00:21,180 --> 03:00:22,180
I'm trying to save the dragon!

2292
03:00:22,180 --> 03:00:23,180
Destroy the sword!

2293
03:00:23,180 --> 03:00:24,180
Posing!

2294
03:00:24,180 --> 03:00:25,180
Moving around!

2295
03:00:25,180 --> 03:00:26,180
We are the Avengers!

2296
03:00:26,180 --> 03:00:27,180
And we are going...

2297
03:00:27,180 --> 03:00:28,180
Oh yeah?

2298
03:00:28,180 --> 03:00:29,180
Well, uh, yeah, well.

2299
03:00:29,180 --> 03:00:31,180
You weren't smart enough to call upon your megazords now.

2300
03:00:31,180 --> 03:00:33,180
We're not supposed to grow!

2301
03:00:33,180 --> 03:00:34,180
What the heck grew?

2302
03:00:34,180 --> 03:00:36,180
Oh no, we need to call upon the megazord!

2303
03:00:36,180 --> 03:00:37,180
Fusion!

2304
03:00:38,180 --> 03:00:39,180
Megazord!

2305
03:00:39,180 --> 03:00:40,180
We can't beat him!

2306
03:00:40,180 --> 03:00:41,180
Sword!

2307
03:00:42,180 --> 03:00:43,180
We need a leg!

2308
03:00:43,180 --> 03:00:57,940
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
